National Fraternity
Moves to Absorb

Local Organization

Merger of Lambda Chi Alpha,

men’s national social fraternity,
with Kappa Alpha Phi, local fra-
ternity, will be completed Sunday
when 21 members of the latter
group are formally initiated into
Lambda Chi Alpha.
. This move climaxes the pro-
tracted attempts of Kappa Alpha
Phi to obtain membership in Inter-
fraternity Council and to become
a national social fraternity. Lamb-
da Chi Alpha is greatly strength-
ened by the union.

As a result, the petition of Kap-
pa Alpha Phi for membership in

-Interfraternity Council, which was

scheduled to be discussed again at

next Tuesday’s meeting of the

group, will be withdrawn.
Rushing plans for this season

fhave been formulated by a com-

mittee composed of representatives

of both houses. The fraternity will

remain at the Lambda Chi Alpha
house, 3501 Terrace street. Kappa
Alpha Phi will give up its present
house, officials say.

Some changes of officers of
Lambda Chi Alpha may be decided
upon after the initiation of the
Kappa Alpha Phis. Members of the
Washington and Jefferson college
chapter of Lambda Chi Alpha will
assist in the ceremonies.

Initiative for the merger of the
two groups was furnished by offi-
cers of Lambda Chi Alpha. De-
tails of the plan for the union were
discussed Thursday, September 29,
at a dinner meeting of ofiicers of
both houses. Instrumental in ar-
ranging the conferences was Clare
Book, Ed25, national vice-presi-
dent of Lambda Chi Alpha.

Biddlette  Rival
In Corley-Headed Boy

Mr. and Mrs. Robert R. Cor-
ley announce the birth of a 7
pound, 11 ounce son, born last
Saturday night in Allegheny
General hospital.

Mr. Corley, assistant dean of
men, announced that the new ar-
rival had been named David Ray
Corley, but refused to reveal
which of his fraternity charges
the son will pledge in 1956.

MRS. MYRTLE MILLER

T HE famous archer demonstrates an the Cathedral lawn ‘the tech-
nique that made her women's international archery champion.

Physical Education Class
Meets Archery Instructor

“The ﬁrst two semesters I studied archery, I was bored,”

stated Mrs. Myrtle Miller, women's international archery"

champion, while addressing a gallery of physical education
students out on the Forbes street lawn last Tuesday.

Mrs. Miller then went on to say that it was not until 1931,
when she received some instruction from Russ Hoogerhyde,

who had won his first champion-
ship the year before, that she be-
gan to take an interest in the
sport.

She found that by using Mr.
Hoogerhyde’s methods she could
hit the “bulls-eye.” Since then, she
has worked steadily at it.

Mrs. Miller, who is attending
the National Recreation Congress
at the William Penn Hotel, is now
mostly interested in teaching arch-
ery instructors. She has her own
school for this in New York.

Archery-golf is the new sport in
the Middle-West, claims Mrs. Mil-
ler. The course is of the same type
as a golf course, but the players
use arrows instead of balls. The
number of shots necessary to ap-
proach and hit the target on the
green are counted as in golf, and
low score wins.

“Horse-back riding is my real
recreation since archery has be-
come a vocation,” insisted Mrs.
Miller, although she mentioned
that she is also interested in ﬁeld-
shooting (hunting) and clout shoot-
ing. In the latter, a large target is
marked out on the ground, and
the arrows are shot into the air
from a distance of around 140
yards.

Following an explanation of the
correct technique for archery, Mrs.
Miller gave a practical demonstra-
tion, including breaking three bal-
loons which were attached to the
target.

Mrs. Miller prefers a hip-quiver
for target-shooting. This is slung
around the waist by a leather belt
and hangs at the right hip. Also
attached to this belt is a wool tas-
sel for wiping arrows if they miss

the target. Otherwise, the sand or
dirt they might collect would wear
them away. She uses leather pro-
tectors for the middle three ﬁn-
gers of her right hand and for the
left forearm. The arm-guard shows
signs of considerable wear.

Dr. Jennings Speaks

To Recreation Group

Dr. 0. E. Jennings, head of the
biology department, will speak to-
day on “Inaugurating and Direct-
ing Nature Programs,” before a
group attending the National Rec-
reation Congress being held this
week at the William Penn hotel.

Yesterday Dr. Jennings spoke on
“A Summary of the Methods of
Nature Recreation” at the Con-
gress, a group devoted to the fur-
thering of recreational facilities in
the United States.

Collie

Rough-coated Collie’s
ancestry is as old as
sheep-herding itself.
Name from Anglo-
Saxon “col” meaning
black. Scotch called
them “colley dogs"
after the black-faced '
“colley” sheep they 
tended. Noted for: V
acute hearing, extra-,_

ordinary homing sense,
devotion to duty.

it is delicate,;.complicated. But here is where a

Carnevale 1......
Seeks Puppeteers

Would you like to be the man
who pulls the strings?

Carmen Carnevale, director of
the Carnevale Marionette Players,
3710 Forbes street, is looking for
University students who are will-
ing to spend a few hours each eve-
ning learning puppetry. No, previ-
ous experience is necessary, but if
you have a voice that can accom-
pany your string-pulling, you are
twice as welcome.

Mr. Carnevale, who directed the
Federal Marionette theater in
Pennsylvania, will put under con-
tract those students who show
promise. The project is not an
amateur organization, but a pro-
fessional marionette theater, made
up of local talent.

Humperdinck’s operetta, “Hansel
and Gretel,” the ﬁrst show, is

Unpredictable Dukes Play .,

Panthers At Stadium   *

One dark, rainy October after-‘
noon in 1936 Duquesne’s George
Matsik sliced through the Panther
line and scampered 79 yards for
the only score of the day and Du-
quesne came through with one of
the season's most startling upsets.

Tomorrow afternoon another Du-
quesne team, sans George Matsik
but well stocked in speedy backs,
will spend a busy afternoon in the
Pitt Stadium intent on repeating
history with the Pitt Panthers,
who will be “agin” this repeat bus-
iness.

MYSTERY TEAM

This band of Clipper Smith’s
Dukes is somewhat of a mystery.
In their opening game they marched
over Waynesburg with little diffi-
culty and last week they lost by a
bad break to a powerful Texas
Tech team, 7-6.

The boys from the Bluff have
been singing the blues. Officially
their two first string quarterbacks,
Barren and Yurchey, spent the
week on hospital cots. By game
time, -however, they may have made
amazing recoveries, and may be
ready to enter the melee.

The Dukes will be in the under-
dog roles and will shoot the works
against the Panthers. Pitt may ex-
pect an emphasized passing attack.

Last week Temple. unable to
make headway through the line,
took to the airlanes andcompleted
14 out of 18 passes, which is All-
American pitching in any league.
Clipper Smith’s men will probably
keep the Panther secondary busy
trying to bat down ﬂying footballs.

GROUND ATTACK

'1'-he Dukemen will be able to un-
leash a hard-running ground at-
tack. Halfbacks Onder and Man-

serve back ‘Vince McKeeta is a
dangerous broken_ ﬁeld runner who
is capable of pulling a “Matsik if
he reaches the clear. Gallagher, the
fullback, hits hard and in his spare
moments efﬁciently c 1 e a r s the
paths for the other backs.

The -Duquesne line is big and
tough. Mazanet" and Co-captain
Serangellipare at the ﬂanks. Ser-
angelli is "one of the best _ends in
the East. Eureka and Critchﬁeld
will be at tackles. Llhoest and
Padlo are the guard men, and Co-
captain Ted Grabinski will be the
snapper-back.

Grabinski and Critchﬁeld are two
boys "who may be the monkey
wrenches in the smooth machinery
of the Panther attack. Both are
veterans, were in the 1936 and '37
line-ups, and starred in the Waynes-
burg and Texas Tech games.

Coach Jock Sutherland ‘will send
the same eleven men into the game
who started the West Virginia and
Temple games-—Daddio and Hoff-
man at ends, Merkovsky and Ras-
kowski at tackles, Lezouski and
Petro at guards, and Dannies at
center. The backﬁeld will again

PASS DEFENSE

Pass defense was stressed in
Pitt practice during the past week.
The ﬁrst and second string back-
ﬁeld spent hours breaking up
passes. That Duquesne will be lib-
eral with their passes is expected
and the pass defense may cause
one of these heaves to backﬁre. _

While the Panther first team has
performed it chores satisfactorily,
the second team work has been
spotty. In the first two games the
second team played as much as the
ﬁrst team and the second stringers
are slated for plenty of action dur-
ing the remaining games on the
schedule. How they perform against
Duquesne may be a criterion of
what kind of rec_ord may be ex-
pected from this Panther squad the
rest of the year. The first team

may not be able to flash champion-

F&M Tomorrow

With a 40-50 victory over the
Purdue harriers, under ’ its belt,
the Pitt cross country team will
travel to Lancaster for tomorrow’s
meet with the Franklin-Marshall
thin clads. The Olsonmen left for
Lancaster this morning.

The Panthers turned in a per-
fect score against the Boilermak-
ers. The ﬁrst ﬁve places were taken
by Pitt. Al Zamborski, Walt Ster-
ner, Casimir Kopec, Frank Mc-
Cabe, and Ben Kopec ﬁnished in
that order. Al Boulanger took sixth
and Bob Cogswell broke the tape
in the ninth slot.

Olson reported that the Frank-
lin and Marshall team was of un-
known calibre. “They may beat us,
or we may beat them,” was the
Olson opinion, which wasn’t saying
too much.

The team that made the trip was
the same that squared off against
Purdue. Zamborski, Sterner, Casi-
mir Kopec, Frank McCabe, Ben
Kopec, Al Boulanger, and Bob
Cogswell will run for Pitt.

Kappa Sigswin Another Cup,
Capture All-Point- Trophy

Kappa Sigma was the leader in "“

interfraternity competition for the
past year and is the recipient of
the Interfraternity All-point tro-
phy, according to ﬁgures released
by Robert R. Corley, assistant to
the dean of men.

Phi Gamma Delta and Delta Tau
Delta ﬁnished second and third, re-
spectively. Kappa Sigma had a to-
tal of 237 points to lead the Phi
Gams with 217 points, and the
Delts with 213.

Included in interfraternity com-
petition were scholarship, basket-
ball, bowling, indoor track, ping-
pong, indoor and outdoor track,
sing, sweepstakes, and mushball.
The other fraternities ﬁnished with
the following point totals:

PiKA . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. 197

Phi Delts . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 185

Kappa Sigma ﬁnished ﬁrst in
volleyball, basketball, indoor track,

and mushball. Added to this total
was a third place gained in outdoor
track and points awarded for en-
tering touch football, sing, bowl-
ing, ping pong, and sweepstakes
events.

The Phi Gains compiled their to-
tal with a ﬁrst in outdoor track;
second places in volleyball, indoor
track, and sweepstakes; and a third
place in the sing meet, plus points
for entering other interfraternity
events.

The Delts had no ﬁrsts but add-
ed_ up seconds in touchfootball, the
sing, and mushball to a third in
indoor track and a fourth in
scholarship and other points to
make up their third place total.

A change will be made in inter-
fraternity competition starting this
year. Instead of having the compe-
tition run from the beginning of
one school year to another, the fra-
ternities have decided to run from
one Interfraternity Ball to another.

This means that points for the
next cup will be computed from the
beginning of basketball competi-
tion last year to the end of volley-
ball this year. The cup will be

There are about 50 men on cam-
pus who are willing to swear that
the intramural program IS a ﬁne
thing. Of course, there are many
more than 50 who believe that, but
those 50 happen to have a very
good reason for their belief.

They got a free meal. The occa-
sion was the Intramural Athletics
Banquet last Tuesday evening for
managers and representatives of
the various teams enrolled in the
program.

Seriously, James Hagan, athletic
director, deserves commendation
for sponsoring the event. It pro-
vided the~men with an opportunity
to become. better acquainted with
the intramural . program and to
meet the people who will work
with them _on » the ‘program.

announced the selection of an ad-
visory’ committee who will serve

Business Review
Records Uptrend

Analyzing the factors inﬂuencing
business in the Pittsburgh district,
the latest issue of Pittsburgh Busi-
ness Review, a monthly summnary
of business conditions published by
the University's Bureau of Busi-
ness Research, states that “gains
of signiﬁcent proportion” were evi-
dent over the summer months.

The Review, released this week,
does not mention the effect of the
beginning of the war scare on the
late August business.

The combined index of general
business activity in this district
rose from July’s 59.8 more than
four points to 65.4 for August.

In all ﬁelds of activity, produc-
tion, employment, trade, transpor-
tation, and real estate and building,
substantial gains were made.

Employment, in terms of man
hours worked rose 10.1 per cent
in August, while the city’s retail
trade was up 9.1 per cent.

New Soccer Group
Begins Practice

Soccer, newest of the Pitt var-
sity sports, gets its first tryout
this week with practice sessions
scheduled every day this week at 3
o’clock on the ﬁeld behind Trees
Gymnasium.

Coach Dave Ward expects about
25 players out for the initial prac-
tice yesterday but hopes for quite
a few more. The type of schedule
which the soccer team will play de-
pends entirely upon the kind of
material which Ward gets.

The daily workouts will continue
for several weeks until Ward de-
cides that the team is far enough
advanced to plunge into a regular
schedule.

Endure Hell Week

Those impromptu concerts ema-

Fifth avenue entrance to the Cathe-

by new members of the University
band, who are now undergoing
“hell week."

Beginning Monday and extend-
ing through yesterday, freshmen
and other new members of the
band underwent a strict period of
initiation “in order to become bet-
ter acquainted with their upper-
classmen and ROTC members,” ac-
cording to Jack Mullen, C41, hell
week chairman.

In addition to wearing their uni-
forms on these days, new members
were required at all times to salute
their officers, report for inspection
each morning at 8:15 o’clock, re-
frain from speaking to the female
sex, and refrain from smoking in
the presence of upperclassmen.

Each member being initiated also
had to procure a love letter from
his girl friend in which she stated
in frank terms his good and bad
points.

ment regarding the pres-
ent change in size of the News
have been reaching our sensi-
tive ears of late.

Many readers, our scouts
tell us, are grumbling disap-
proval over the unprecedented
change to tabloid form. Oth-
ers, we hear, think the small

sized pages are just the thing
(especially for reading in
class.) “

To -silence "momentarily our
army of critics, and in order
not to raise any unnecessary
hopes among the tabloid-
lovers, we think it necessary
to explain by repeating and
re-emphasizing our statement
which has been run as part of
the masthead during the past
several issues.

The gist of this explanation
is that the present small
format will not necessarily be
the permanent form of the
paper. When the News is or-
ganized on a permanent basis
sometime this month, staff
members will be given an op-
portunity to express their
preference as to size and fre-
quency of publication.

What that preference will

be, we can’t say. But we can
predict that every effort will
be made to put out the kind of
paper which both the student
body and the News staff de-
sire, and, it follows, will be
proud to read.

So . . . keep cool and watch
for the announcement of a
permanent News, as has so
often been said, in the near
future.

Hot Noose On Soose

Billy Soose, former Penn State student who does not at-
tend Pitt, is admittedly a boxer of some ability. He is train-
ing for his coming bout with Babe Risko in an informal ring
in the Commons Room, composed mainly of Jane Epping—
who is quite a sparring partner herself. Dick Powell, the
movie lover, and Les Hamburg, former Phi Ep prexy, have
a ﬁnancial interest in Soose, we have it on good authority.

Recommended freshwomen: Pat Dean, Lois Gailbreath, the Smythe

sisters, Jane Wilson, Eleanor Factor . . . . and others, frankly too
numerous to mention. Impartial connoisseurs admit that, without a
shadow of a doubt, this year’s crop is peerless.

Larry Orr, Sigma Chi playboy, has been rushing down to Tennessee
for his hay fever (or Joan Young, as it is sometimes known). Don't
write—telephone, says News Bizmanager Reich, who has just signed
up for ads from-Bell Telephone . . . .

Startled were his intimates to see Red (“Sure Pop”) Scott wearing a
complete suit of clothes to school. When queried, he disclosed that
he had a date for that afternoon at ﬁve o'clock, a cocktail date. “You

Marion Conn, former women's editor of the News, was married’
to Preston Kinnard Penn, med school senior, in the latter part of
August. They are building a home in Pleasant Hills. And Mary
Lewis, who often wrot-e this colyum, and Bob Ashcom have been
joined in conjugal bliss.

Belated congratulations from The News, girls! This illustrates the
oft-asserted fact that there is plenty of opportunity for advancement
on the Pitt News.

The newspaper reports of Tom Springer’s death have been greatly
exaggerated. He was injured in that auto accident, yes; but he is
now hobbling around on a cane and is no more dead than you or we.

Life Among the Aborigines

Among the few graduates who we know have jobs is Al Barr, with
International Business Machines, who is not responsible for the IBM
registering system installed this summer at the University. Nick Spa-

INTERCOLLEGIATE

It Takes All Kinds

At Los Angeles City college, the literary lot calls itself the Jabber-
wocks. Rather brillig . . . . From the same college, “Chili today and
hot tamale.” . . . . At Morgantown, W. Va., the students hold Thuses
to work up enough energy to sit in the stands during the football

Latest word from the University of Kentucky is that Andy Duke
is NOT pinned to Skeeter Thomas even though love is in the air.
We thought you'd like to know. During the halves at UK the band-
boys play “A Tisket, A Tasket.” If something subtle is intended,
we don't get it.

The Bond and Key fraternity boys at Susquehanna stayed in last
week to see the blooming of the Cereus. The ﬂower opens about 8
o'clock and remains open until midnight. A hectic time was had by all.

The headline in Lehigh’s Brown and White reads: Elissa Landi
Slated To Talk, Act Here. Actress With Experience in Theatre and
Movies To Show Diﬁerence . . . . The freshman class at Bethlehem
includes 17 valedictorians and nine salutatorians. It seems rather
futile.

From the Dartmouth, the oldest college newspaper in America, we
glean news that a white-tailed tropic bird was blown inland by the
recent storm. This specimen is seen but rarely anywhere north of

ested in peace.

At the next meeting, the Men’s

Oakland building.

The room, whose librarian is
Miss Irene Millen, former concert
and radio pianist, houses a collec-
tion of over 8,000 volumes. Of this
number, approximately 5,000 are
volumes‘ of musical scores, while
the remainder are books of musical

(Continued from Page 1)

Final vote of approval on the
merger was taken by members of
Kappa Alpha Phi last Monday. Fol-
lowing this, officers of the two
groups met to arrange details of
the absorption.

Although Kappa Alpha Phi has
been a social fraternity for the
past two years, it was not recog-
nized as such by the Men’s Frater-
nity Committee, until the end of
last semester.

This lack or recognition by the
committee prevented Kappa Alpha
Phi from being considered for
membership in Interfraternity
Council, despite the fraternity’s
repeated bids for acceptance.

Since 1924, Kappa Alpha Phi
had been a chapter of a national
business fraternity. Last spring, in
order to gain acceptance as a so-
cial ‘fraternity by the Men’s Fra-
ternity Committee, Kappa Alpha
Phi rewrote their constitution and
severed all connections with the
national organization.
