Nicaraguan official
criticizes U.S. policy

By Michael Ashford
Special Projects Editor

The U.S.—sponsored ship of the Con-
tra war against Nicaragua is a policy
based on America‘s ignorance of the
political, social and economic realities
in Central America. according to Ale-
jandro Martinez Cuenca, Nicaragua’s
minister of foreign trade and com-
merce.

Martinez. who holds a Ph.D. in
economics from Vanderbilt Universi-
ty. said. “The Reagan administration
is afraid of the truth and has created a
smokescreen to divert attention away
from very elementary issues in Central
America."

The Reagan administration is cur-
rently engaged in an intense campaign
to win congressional approval for $100
million in military and economic aid for
the Contra forces ﬁghting to overthrow
the Nicaraguan government from bases
in Honduras, a small country on Nica-
ragua’s northern border.

“It is our moral responsibility to tell
the truth,” Martinez said. “The mer-
cenary forces have no popular support,
and their only source ofoxygen is the
money the U.S. administration is giv-
ing them; they cannot win, no matter
how much money they receive."

Martinez warned that the Reagan ad-
ministration's refusal to “understand
the facts” about Nicaragua and the ad-
ministration’s support for the Contras
will lead to disaster. Reagan’s rejection
of the efforts of eight major Latin

American nations to present a viable
plan for peace last January, Martinez
said “is a vote for war instead of peace
and a slap in the face of Latin America.

“This administration knows that its

policy has failed and wants only to v

defeat the freely—elected government of
Nicaragua.” Martinez said. “The
reason why the Contras cannot win is
the same reason why Somoza could not
hold power in spite of the millions of
dollars the U.S. administration gave
him in 1978.“

The military dictatorship of Anastas-
io Somoza Debayle was overthrown in
a popular revolution led by the San-
dinistas in 1979.

“The real tragedy is that if the
United States continues its policy of
supporting the Contras. they will have
to militarily intervene." Martinez said.
“Nicaragua will not be another Gre-
nada; when and ifthe first Marine puts
his foot down in Nicaragua, we are all
going to ﬁght, no matter how much we
have to lose in doing so."

The recent peace proposal made by
the afﬁliation of Latin American na-
tions known as the Contadora Initiative
met all U.S. demands upon Nicaragua
except the U.S. stipulation that Nic-
aragua enter into direct negotiations
with the Contra forces. Nicaragua,
Martinez said, refuses to acknowledge
the Contras asa legitimate political en-
tity because the core of the Contra
forces consists of former Somozan na-
tional guards who have refused Nica-
raguan amnesty.

UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Alejandro Martinez Cuenca, Nicaragua’s Minister of Foreign

Trade and Commerce spoke at Forbes Quad Friday night.

In arguing for support for the Con-
tras, the Reagan administration con-
tends that the Nicaraguan government
is an oppressive Marxist regime built
upon a centralized and tightly-con-
trolled economy sustained through ex-
tensive trade with the Soviet Union and
East Bloc countries.

The picture Martinez drew Friday
night was quite different. Nicaragua,
Martinez explained, maintains trade
relations with countries all over the
world.

“Today. 73 percent of the total of
Nicaragua’s trade is with Western

By Kathy Stahl
Staff Writer

The air seems to be charged with
energy. Everywhere people are con-
tinually moving about in a rush of ac-
tivity. But John Gloninger, a graduate
student in GSPIA, seems unaffected by
all the commotion. He is too busy
thinking of the ambassadors, foreign
representatives, political leaders and
academics he will be dining with this
week.

Gloninger is an assistant in the of-
ﬁce of the International Security

a Studies, located in the University Cen-

icles an alleged conspiracy that led to
the shooting and consequent death of
one of America's most charismatic
leaders. It examines the actual event
and the findings of the Warren Com-
mission Report. the government sanc-
tioned investigation of the assassina-
tion. The movie features Will Geer.
Burt Lancaster and Robert Ryan. The
film asserts that although the characters
are fictitious. the content ofthe film is
based on facts.

Weeht. in 1964, was asked to re-
view the Warren Commission Report.
Wecht acted as a pathology represen-
tative of the Annual Meeting of the
American Academy of Forensic Sci-
ences. Due to the generosity ofJacque—

line Kennedy Onassis. five years after
Kennedy's death, all information from
the investigation was available at the
National Archives for examination. As
a pathologist. Weeht was chosen to
have access to the photographs, autop-
sy slides and the medical files from the
case.

Wecht strongly argues against the
single—bullet theory of Kennedy's
death. He supports the idea that pos-
sibly three or four bullets were fired
at the former president. Wecht. a lec-
turer in rhetoric classes here at Pitt.
also strongly believes that a conspiracy
was engaged in to eliminate Kennedy
and his brand of politics.

Wecht has been lecturing around the
United States for more than 10 years

on the subject and has appeared on talk
shows advocating his climination—con—
spiracy theory. Wecht was commis-
sioned to testify before the Rockefeller
Commission to review the assassin-
ation.

Wecht’s lecture and the screening of
“Executive Action" are sponsored by
Pitt Program Council. the Student Bar
Association. the Black American Law
Students Association and the National
Lawyer’s Guild at Pitt. A donation of
$1 will be charged for Wecht‘s lecture
and the movie.

“Executive Action” will be shown
at 7 and 9 p.m. on March 15. and on
March 17 at 9 p.m. The proceeds will
benefit the Educational Fund for Tony
Gilliam's Children.

international workshops this week

ter for International Studies. He is cur-
rently helping the ISS to coordinate this
week‘s workshop on “Peace and Secu-
rity in the Middle East.”

“There are actually two separate
workshops." said Gloninger. “The
first focuses on the Middle East and
then on Wednesday the second will
focus on the Atlantic Alliance."

Monday and Tuesday will be high-
lighted by two dinner discussion and
debate sessions in the William Pitt
Union Dining Room. Monday's discus-
sion will center on “The Super Powers
in the Middle East" and will be led by
Dr. Hunter from Georgetown Univer-
sity and Dr. Rubinstein from the Uni-

versity of Pennsylvania.

On Tuesday the Honorable Claus
Maksud. the ambassador to the League
of Arab States for the United Nations
and Dr. Mark Heller from Tel Aviv
University will debate on the “Arab-
Israeli Confrontation."

Overall there will be 16 participants
at the workshop, including two par-
ticipants from Pitt: Dr. Coffey. the
director of ISS and Dr. Cottam. pro-
fessor of political science.

The second workshop. beginning on
Wednesday, will be highlighted by a

round table discussion on “Europeans - -

look at the United States.” The discus-
sion will include representatives from

Turkey, Belgium, Italy and the Federal
Republic of Germany.

Hosting international workshops as
well as various other activities enables
Pitt’s UCIS to stay on top of things,
which is a leading factor in its being
one of the top organizations of its kind
in the country.

Another project that the UCIS has
worked on is the development of Penn-
sylvania’s new Governor’s School for
International Studies on the Pitt cam-
pus. This program runs in the summer
for ﬁve weeks and includes select par-
ticipants form various high schools in
the area.

Festival to

highlight

Latin
Americans

By Jack Burkman
Staff Writer

On Saturday, the University will
hold the seventh Annual Latin Amer-
ican Folk Festival. According to coor-
dinator Jerry La Forgia. the event
figures to be quite a spectacle. As in
the past, there will be plenty of food
and dancing. This year. however. the
festival will feature live music.

“We have some very talented Latin

American musicians this spring," said '

La Forgia. “Both the Peruvian and the
Venezuelan groups have eight-or ten-
piece ensembles. In addition, we’ve got
two jazz bands.”

La Forgia feels the variety of foods
is perhaps the most intriguing aspect of
the entire event. Many people think that
all Latin American food is the same,
e.g. torillas and hot peppers.

“That’s a common misconception,”
said La Forgia. “It’s a myth. Compar-
ing Latin American cuisines is no dif-
ferent than comparing European cui-
sines; they are very, very different.
People tend only to think of Mexico
because it's closest to the United States.
In fact, our foods will be so varied,
everyone will undoubtedly be able to
find something they like.”

Culturally, Saturday‘s festivities are
of great signiﬁcance to Latin American
students. As La Forgia points out, the
events represent “the only time during
the year the university’s Hispanic con-
tingent can express itself.“

Pitt student Wilma Petrash. a Ven-
ezuelan participant, sees the festival in
a very positive light. “This [the festi-
val] is an especially good experience
for us. It’s like being in contact with
our own culture again. At the same
time. the festival will help us to become
closer to America.”

Participation in the upcoming bazaar
is by no means limited to Pitt students.
According to La Forgia, members of
the faculty, various ethnic groups and
students from Dusquene, CMU and
CCAC are also making major contribu-
tions. One of the bands, La Forgia
noted. is comprised solely of musicians
from the surrounding community.

La Forgia made it clear that a con-
siderable amount of work has gone in-
to preparing for the festival. Efforts to
coordinate the project began in Decem-
ber and have continued relentlessly
ever since. Latin American studies has
managed to arrange for exhibits from
more than 17 countries.

Not only is admission free, but, ac-
cording to La Forgia. those who attend
might even walk away with some cash.

“There’s a dance contest at 8:30
p.m.," he said. “For prizes, we’re
giving away money and free dinners at
nearby Latin American restaurants.“

United Nations officials question U. S. orders

The Pitt News. March 10. 1986

  

‘Z’

NEW YORK -— United Nations of-
ficials are questioning whether the
United States can legally order the
Soviet mission to reduce its staff. Legal
experts told The New York Times that
"even if the U.N. determines that the
American directive is illegal. the U.N.
can't stop it." The Soviets have ac-
cused the United States of trying to bul-
ly the United Nations. The Reagan ad-
ministration ordered the Soviets to cut
their staff members from the present
275 to 170 by April 1988. U.S. of-
ficials said they issued the order
because of continued spying by mem-
bers of the Soviet mission.

anti—Contra tactics

MANAGUA. Nicaragua — Nica-
ragua is raising worker salaries for the
second time this year. but basic food
prices are going up even more as the
troubled Central American nation faces
219 percent inflation. The 50 percent
raises and the price increases are sup-
posed to stimulate production and lead
to the “total defeat" of the U.S.—

backed Contra rebels. More than half

of Nicaragua's budget goes to fighting
the Contras.

S. Africa police

JOHANNESBURG. South Africa —
Police in Johannesburg have an uniden-

Contras: No Force
For Democracy

President Reagan is currently importuning Con-
gress to finance revolution in Nicaragua to the tune
of $100 million. The zealous singularity of Mr.
Reagan’s purpose in this instance has given rise to
some rather unsavory tactics. Red—baiting, the lesser
of his offenses, has been employed to suggest that
opposition to his plan to supply aid to the Contras
is tantamount to tacit support of communism. But by
far the most egregious ethical affront comes of Mr.
Reagan’s remark suggesting that the aid package is
necessary to prevent “our American boys” from
becoming involved in Nicaragua. These attempts to
extort that which cannot be secured through honest
means reflect poorly on the president’s polemics.

There are many reasons for denying Mr. Reagan’s
request for aid to the Contras, utmost among them
being the lack of mass indigenous support for the rebel
forces. While Mr. Reagan proclaims that the Contra
cause is a democratic revolution, virtually nowhere
is there evidence of a mass demand for liberty. The
Contras have succeeded in attracting some desultory
support in the countryside, but they have yet to
establish a foothold in a single city.

In spite of the failings and shortcomings of the San-
dinista government, it has been a much greater friend
of the people (in particular the poor) of Nicaragua
than ever was the hated Somoza regime. Schools and
hospitals, ever in short supply prior to the Sandinistas,
are now available to even the poorest of Nicaraguans.

What Mr. Reagan is proposing is to artiﬁcially pro-
tract and prolong with American tax dollars a strug-
gle that is neither just nor winnable without the sup-
port of the Nicaraguan people — support that is
nowhere forthcoming. The Contras, many of whom
had dark allegiances to the Somaza regime, are little
more than a ragtag band of disenfranchised malcon-
tents seeking to revenge themselves for their altered
fortunes. This hardly constitutes a revolutionary force
for democracy.

Police Harassment

The similarities between black life in
racist South Africa and black life in
racist America have been mentioned
and discussed since well before the re-
cent U.S. surge of interest in the South
African apartheid system. Having said
this, I promise not to mention those
similarities again but instead will just
give a detailed account of an empirical
observation I experienced at the hands
of our friendly campus police.

At approximately 9 p.m. Thursday
evening. I was studying political
science" in the Afro—American section
of Hillman Library —- disturbing no
one and completing backed-up course-
work. My African boyfriend Lucas
Tita entered the room and talked with
me. helping vme with parliamentary
procedure (which he understands bet-
ter than I since his homeland.
Cameroon. has a governmental system
modeled after Britain's). A little after
9 p.m.. I decided to leave but had
copies to make on the ground ﬂoor. As
we approached the desk to ask for
change. three campus police officers,
one white female. one white male and
one black plain—clothed. appeared from
nowhere. asked if we were students and
requested I.D.. having given no ex-
planation whatsoever. When I respond-
ed “uncooperatively." the black cop
stated that my boyfriend had entered
the library without any books looking
“suspicious” (suspiciously black?) and
that they weren”t sure if he was bother-
ing me or not. After more uncoopera-
tive exchanges. the female officer ﬁnal-
ly told me they had gotten a report that
someone was “hurting" people in the
library and they were just “checking
us out." Did they think we were hurt-
ing people as a couple‘? They admitted
he wasn‘t bot/iering me. so how could
he have been hurting me‘?

As it turns out. I showed the female
not only my student l.D. but my work
l.D. as well (l‘ve been employed at the
univer~;it_\' for over 10 years). I was
threatened with force whenvl refused
to let her write my name and my social
security number down because I didn’t
understand why this information was
crucial to her and demanded a clearer
explanation. (I was told to read the
university manual on students rights
and university security).

I have filed a complaint with the
campus police. I have complained to
Assistant Provost for Undergraduate
Programs Jack Daniel and am. through
this letter. complaining to the univer-
sit)’ as a whole.

I promised I wouldn‘t mention those
similarities. but I will bring to light one
difference between the way police in
South Africa and police in, America
deal with black people. In South Africa

white police admit themselves that they

t(i.e., the South African government)

are treating black people unjustly and
having admitted that expect the worst
at any encounter. In America white
police (who carry along a black tokie
to smooth things out) feel they (i.e., the
U.S. government) are treating black
people as equals and therefore expect
cooperation at any encounter. How
ridiculous can members of a society

that has oppressed us from day one be? «

Black people will be on campus —
as my friend Mr. Tita would say, “We
ain’t goin’ nowwhere” — we also ain’t
goin' to let white police harass us un-
necessarily nor cooperate when they
do.

More Room
Needed

I agree with your editorial on the
Trees Hall blues. It is overcrowded.
The equipment is in poor physical
shape. _

I suggest it is time to build another
athletic facility. A facility that would
benefit both students and the athletic
teams.

An indoor facility with a 50-yard
football field. a new indoor tack.
another weight room. additional rac-
quetball courts and convertible basket-
ball/tennis courts.

The need is for a building with a lot
of versatility built into it.

It is evident to anyone who uses
Trees Hall or the [Fitzgerald] Field
House. More room is needed!

I know this is a costly proposal which
will take some planning. I think the
benefit to the students. the university
and the athletic teams would be worth
the cost.

I am not a member of any athletic
team. I believe that no matter what
sports benefit. the bottom line is that

Bold Ideas

The author of “Social Darwinian
Elitist" obviously misunderstood
Kevin Bold‘s “Why I Like Social Dar-
winism.“ In his concluding paragraph.
he stated that egalitarian utopians call
anyone who disagree with themsocial
darwinists. Mr. Bold was simply say-
ing that he was not going to be in-
timidated. He was not advocating
anything like the philosophy of Herbert
Spencer. and if the anonymous writer
would read some of Mr. Bold’s other
columns. he would find that Mr. Bold
is much too individualistic to do so. In
the future. dear writer, if you can’t
have the courage to let The Pitt News
publish your name, you could at least
have the decency to read Mr. Bold‘s
ideas in their proper context before try-
ing to refute him.

Creed For The Unreligious

My mother cried when I told her I
wouldn‘t go to confession anymore.
She couldn‘t understand. She thought
she must be a terrible person. having
raised a girl like this.

People who aren't purely religious
still think a lot about God. I tried to ex-
plain this to my mother because I don‘t
like her feeling guilty. I‘ll try to explain
it now because there are too many peo-
ple out to tell other people what to
believe.

Talking about God is a difficult thing
to do without sounding didactic. So. I'll
start with something a little more ob-
jective. Let’s talk about belief.

Belief is a good thing. Whatever you
believe is trite simply because you
believe it. Certain words define
themselves. and this is one of them.

Religion is not such a good thing ~-
at least not organized religion.
"()rganiz.ed" means people ganging

together and taking charge of other
people. We'd solve a lot of problems
if we all would just give up trying to
take charge of other people.

Besides. if there were some outstand-
ing. true faith out there. I think some-
one would have discovered it by now.
In fact. everyone would‘ve discovered
it by now. Iftruth were some singular.
objective thing. there wouldn‘t be
however—many hundreds of religions to
choose from.

For this reason. I can't stand up and
say the Catholics are rig/II. I don't think
the Jews are going to hell. I don‘t think
homosexuals are damned. Einstein and
Michelangelo just didn't earn that. I
want to know who thought so much of
themselves as to dream those up. I
doubt God thought of it.

Sometimes I think that God is a
dream in everyone‘s mind that nobody
dreams the same. There are too many

people with different ideas for things
to be otherwise — and if you disagree
with that. youjust prove it further. (Of
course. ifyou believe that God lives in
your closet and tells you to hurt peo-
ple. then that‘s not the same thing.
Biological imbalances aren‘t beliefs.)
In other words. unless you‘re mental-
ly ill. God is pretty much anything you
think He is.

This is a strange theory: man creat-
ing God for himself. A God to favor
him. to give him solace. to make him
feel that maybe there is some good
reason for all of us to be here. And why
not.’ No matter who created whom.
believing one or the other has made a
lot of people feel better about their
lives.

I hear a lot of arguments about Jesus.
Somebody. somewhere said there are
records to prove that He existed. that

SDI or NIH?

What would you say to a ballistic
missile defense system that could be
deployed by the middle of the next
decade. would stop 99 percent of in-
coming Soviet ICBMs and could cost
as little as 50 percent of what the
Reagan administration wants to spend
on research alone for its Star Wars
system? Don’t say impossible just yet
— although it has received little publici-
ty. such a plan exists.

One can easily understand why the
opponents of space-based defense don’t
mention it; it would deﬂate the argu-
ment of expense and time for research.
development and deployment. But why
would those who favor space-based
defense refrain from discussing it‘?

The answer lies in the fact that this
proposed system. known as “High
Frontier.“ is the brainchild ofa private
think tank rather than government
researchers. Unlike Strategic Defense
Initiative. High Frontier is NIH: Not
Invented Here.

High Frontier is fairly simple. Like
some other space defense systems. it
consists of a minimum of three tiers of
anti-missile weapons which would in-
tercept and destroy incoming Soviet
ICBMs. If each tier is 90 percent ef-
fective. the Soviets would have to
launch 1,000 warheads in order to in-
sure that one would land on American
soil. Four tiers would increase the
launch—to—hit ratio to 10,000 to 1. (Now

you know why the Soviets don‘t want
us to deploy it.)

There are additional advantages to
the High Frontier approach:

1. None of its weapons are nuclear.
(Some proposed SDI systems do use
nuclear weapons.)

2. It would cost less than any of the
other proposals. Even its most expen-
sive price estimate ($40 billion) is com-
parable to the cost of research and
development alone for Reagan’s SDI
and well below the $1 trillion deploy-
ment cost which SDI’s critics estimate
(a number pulled out ofthin air if ever
I heard one).

3. It could be deployed by the end
of the century if not sooner.

4. It would be used only against

He died the way they said He died. But
that's not the point. If you don't believe
He saved anyone. if you don't believe
He was sane. if you don’t believe He
even existed at all — fine. What mat-
ters is. the man had a good idea. Let's
not make each other quite so misera-
ble. He said. And it makes sense.
That’s all religion is. really. or maybe
that's all it should be. Somebody has
a good idea. and somebody else
believes it.

Yet. if you decide to believe in Jesus.
then you’d have to believe in God as
well. if you‘re thinking logically.
You'd have to believe that someone set
this whole world up this way on pur-
pose. That‘s a little harder to swallow
than believing in a man who sat on a
mountain and preached for good.

Then think: There are some things
men simply can not explain. No one

Soviet strategic weapons -— not against
their military forces or their civilians.

5. It is strictly defensive in nature and
fits our deterrent policy. (The Soviet
policy is a war—fighting policy. We
desire to prevent World War III; they
intend to win it.)

Most of the arguments against any
spaced-based defense system don‘t hold
much water. “It would be destabiliz-
ing” naively assumes that the world is
stable — the headlines say otherwise.
“It would have to be perfect” neglects
the fact that the Soviets wouldn’t launch
l0.000 warheads just to hit one or two
American cities. “It simply won‘t
work" is only true for perpetual mo-
tion machines. “It would upset the
Soviets" is no reason against it at all

knows why an apple seed contains a
spark of something that will make it
grow while a grain of sand does not.

There are some things that simply
cannot be explained. and they exist
anyway. God may be one of those
things.

It doesn’t prove anything; it doesn't
disprove anything. I‘m not necessari-
ly convinced yet. either. but it‘s the
best explanation I can think of. and
that's all anybody can do. It works for
me. And I/rat's the point.

UVVII.

~ it‘s a good argument in its favor!
High Frontier does away with the cost
and time arguments as well.

However. there is one argument
against SDI that has some merit. Carl
Sagan has noted that one possible
Soviet response would be to deploy a
cheaper system of their own. I have no
doubt what that cheaper system would
look like. You can read about it in
“High Frontier: A Strategy for Na-
tional Survival“ by Lt. Gen. Daniel 0.
Graham. So can the Soviets.

Authors Note: Gen. Graham's book
should not be confused with Gerard K.
O’Neill’s "The High Frontier,” which
is about the non-military settlement of
near—Earth space and a good book in
its own right.

"We offer the certiﬁcates instead of
the degrees because we feel that it is
important for all students to be edu-
cated and maintain a degree from a
school or department within the univer-
sity." said Holzner. “For example. a
student in political science could sup-
plement his degree with a certificate in
Russian and East European studies.
Then. from this base a student can fur-
ther his work in the area studies.

“More students could and should be
involved in the UCIS.” said Holzner.
“The world is becoming more and
more interdependent and learning about
the international scene is also becom-
ing more important."

The center for Russian and East
European Studies has current exchange
partners in numerous countries which
include the Institute of International
Politics and Economics in Belgrade and
the Polish Institute of International Af-
fairs in Warsaw. The center for Latin
American Studies is one of 10 com-
prehensive national resource centers on
Latin America in the United States.

The UCIS also offers many oppor-
tunities for students tostudy abroad.
The Asian Studies Program will be
presenting a panel discussion on “A

Year in Japan." Pitt, along with three V

other universities. offers a two
semester program of study and living
experience in Kobe, Japan. A

There is also an overseas study pro-
gram and a semester at sea program
which is open to all Pitt students.

recovers
shuttle
remains

Cape Canaveral, Fla. (UPI) -
NASA has reported that the wreckage
of the exploded shuttle Challenger’s
crew compartment has been found.

A spokesman said the compartment.
with the remains of the shuttle crew in-
side. was located by sonar on Friday
off the Florida coast. The families of
the seven-member shuttle crew were
informed of the discovery.

A NASA statement said divers from
the USS Preserver started recovery
operations Saturday morning. Accord-
ing to NASA spokesman Hugh Harris.
the shuttle wreckage "was located at a
depth of about 100 feet below the sur-
face of the Atlantic Ocean.

Harris stresses, however, that hedid
not know if the entire crew was inside
the split—level crew module or what
condition the cabin was in. He added.
“Local security measures are being
taken to assure that the recovery opera-
tions can take place in a safe and order-
ly manner."

NASA will not make any further
comment until the recovery operation
and identifications are finished.

Challenger blasted off on its ill-fated
mission Jan. 28 from Cape Canaveral.
It was destroyed just 73 seconds after
liftoff when a rupture in its right side
rocket booster apparently sparked an
explosion of the ship's giant external
liquid fuel tank.

The crew members on board the
shuttle included New Hampshire high
school teacher Christa McAuliffe.
Cmdr. Francis “Dick“ Scobee. co-
pilot Michael Smith. Judith Resnik.
Ellison Onizuka. Ronald McNair and
Satellite Engineer Gregory Jarvis.

countries.“ Martinez said. Domesticat-
ly. more than 77 percent of the produc-
tive property in Nicaragua is privately
owned; 80 percent of Nicaragua’s ex-
ports go to Western Europe and Japan.

The many trade unions in the coun-
try. although often supporting the San-

dinista Party. are politically independ-
ent, he said, adding that several in-
dependent political parties are now in-
volved in formulating the nation’s con-
stitution. Martinez also noted that some
40 U.S. companies are currently op-
erating in Nicaragua. including Exxon.
IBM and various hotel corporations.

"I‘m a Catholic. and my children go
to Catholic schools." Martinez said.
"There is freedom of religion in
Nicaragua.”

In this way, Martinez contested the
assertions of the Reagan adminstration
and demonstrated that Nicaragua em-
braces a mixed economy and pursues
a non—aligned foreign policy by main-
taining balanced relations with Western
European nations. the East Bloc and the
nations of Asia.

“The fact is that the United States
is the most powerful propaganda ma-
chine in the world and has been distort-
ing the truth about Nicaragua for five
years,” Martinez said. “Now it seeks
to distract public opinion from its
failed policy toward Nicaragua."

Martinez explained that, in the face
of U.S. hostility, Nicaragua has had to
be innovative in financing its economy
and in finding new trading partners.
More than half of its foreign assistance
now comes from Western Europe,‘he
said.

Since the U.S. embargo was an-
nounced last May, Nicaragua was
named vice—presidential member of the
International General Agreements on
Tariffs and Trade Organization, pres-
idential member of the International
Coffee Growers Organization and has
become a full member of the U.N.
Commission on Human Rights and the
U.N. Commission on Food and Agri-
cultural > Development.

“We truly want the same kinds of
relations with the people and govern-
ment of the United States," Martinez
said. “Ifthere are experts in particular
fields from other countries in Nica-
ragua, it is because we have not re-
ceived them from the United States."

Soon after the revolution which
brought the Sandinista government to
power in 1979, the United States halt-
ed all credits for food and social pro-
jects, suspended quotas for importing
Nicaraguan sugar and began supporting
the Contras in 1981.

Acknowledging the existence or
some government restrictions on the
press in Nicaragua, a point which
the Reagan administration has often

brought up in arguing for aid to the
Contras, Martinez said the restrictions
were enacted because “we are fighting
for our most fundamental right, our
right to life. As soon as that right is
assured for Nicaragua, all the others
will be assured."

The Reagan administration also con-
tends that Nicaragua is destabilizing
Central America by supplying arms to
revolutionary movements in the region
— despite the fact that all but a few
Central American governments have
established relations with Nicaragua
and are calling for an end to U.S. sup-
port ot the Contras.

“Revolutions cannot be exported,”
Martinez said. “Shoes. trousers and
cotton are exported. Revolutions are
the result of oppression and all the
social structures which don’t modify
themselves with the movement of time.
Our existence, our relations with Cuba
or any other country, does not cause
revolutions in the region.”

Martinez added that “we love our
revolution too much to wish its destruc-
tion by going outside our borders. Do-

ing that would be giving the United
States a reason to intervene on a silver
platter.” ‘

Asked why, in his opinion, the Rea-
gan administration was unable to
change its policy toward Nicaragua.
Martinez referred to the Republican
Party Convention in Santa Fe, N.M.
in 1980.

“The Nicaraguan revolution gave
the excuse to the Republican platform
to pick on that case to show the world
you are still strong and can lead the
world," he said. “Unfortunately,
Nicaragua is nothing in this chess
game. But they cannot accept that there
can be a poor, tiny country in the
Americas who comes up and says, ‘I
want to be independent, I want to
choose what is best for my people, not
what is best for your interests." The
problem is that today this Country is be-
ing administered. directed and guided
by ideologues who think that the world
today continues to be the world of the
McCarthy era. In the ideologue’s mind.
everything is black and white, there is
no middle way."

“Jewish Hotline” aired
on Pitt radio station

By Mike Churchill
For the Pitt News

A new radio program called the
Jewish Hotline is being aired by WPTS
on Thursdays from 7:30 to 8 p.m. Rab-
bi Kagan hosts the show. which in-
cludes discussions of Biblical passages
and Jewish music.

Funding for the show is provided by
Furtherance of Jewish Education. a
local organization directed by Rabbi
Meir Goldwasser.

“The purpose of the show." said
Goldwasser. “is to spread Jewish
knowledge and practice. We feel many
students would be interested in learn-
ing more and possibly haven't had the
opportunity to look at religion more in-
depth."

“Rabbi Goldwasser represents the
Hasidic faction ofJudaism. which is an
orthodox segment of the Jewish popula-
tion,” said Hillel President Dave
Goldstein. “Goldwasser doesn’t claim
to take a mainstream view. The goal
of the awareness program is to
enlighten Jews to what‘s out there.

“The vast majority of American
Jews are considered liberal," Goldstein
continued. “There is a small but
signiﬁcant presence of traditional Jews
at Pitt. A lot of traditional Jews aren’t
active on the campus. because they
practice with the community. I would
make a stab that just under I percent
of Pitt students are traditional Jews.

“The Pitt Hillel Club.“ said Gold-
stein, “supports and encourages par-
ticipation of any Jewish organization

which seeks to raise consciousness."

Reactions to the show. however, are
decidedly mixed. Dave Lawver. WPTS
programming director. said that the
Jewish Hotline is being moved to Sun-
day. “The show receives more com-
plaints than positive responses. People
don‘t like the timing,“ he said. “It
would be far better on Sunday.

"WPTS is required to do a certain
amount of new programming." said
Lawver. “and the show fulfills part of
our public service requirement."

Pitt student Mark Daniels has a
similar view. "I don‘t think it raises
anybod.y‘s consciousness." said
‘Daniels. “Ifyou're an Orthodox Jew.
you wouldn‘t need something like this
to keep you in the fold and if they”re
trying to reach an uncommitted au-
dience. this is an ineffective method.
People don't listen to WPTS to find
religion."

Rabbi Goldwasser was ordained in
New York before moving to Pitts-
burgh. He and his father now operate
a wholesale produce business in the
Strip District. Goldwasser ran a pro-
gram 12 years ago on WIXZ in
McKeesport that was similar to his pre-
sent one. That show lasted about a
year. He plans to continue to run the
present show for now. “We hope to
continue it indefinitely,“ said
Goldwasser.

Rabbi Kagan. the host of the Jewish
Hotline. is from Detroit and has been
doing radio shows for about 20 years.
Kagan tapes the show and gives the
tapes to Goldwasser.

i Est Championship aainst

fChaz PaIIa/ The 

By Jim Urban
Sports Editor

NEW YORK — ()h ye of little faith.
So many times this year it was written
or said that the St. John‘s success stor_v
would be short-lived because of its
bench. or the lack of one. Well. just
after half of the nation had written the
Redmen off at halftime ofthe Big East
Championship game. the Redmen
stormed back and captured their second
Big East Tournament Championship.
defeating Syracuse 70-69.

“It was a great. great victory.“ St.
Johirs coach Lou Carneseeca said after
the game.

Senior guard Ron Rowan buried at
baseline jumper with six seconds re-
maining in the game to give St. Johirs
the win.

“We were looking fbr a big
hole to crawl into, but we had
the ability to come back. That
is the one characteristic of
this crew: consistency. We
get behind, we come back. ”

— Lou Carnesecca

The Redmen trailed 39-28 at the in-
termission. Syracuse shot a scalding 73
percent in the first half. while St.
John‘s struggled. hitting only 38 per-
cent from the field. St. John’s leading
scorer. junior Walter Berry. was held
in check by Syracuse‘s zone defense.

“We lost our poise in the first half
for the first time all year.“ Carnesec-
ca said.

But they soon regained it. Only six
minutes into the second half. the
Redmen had cut the ‘Syracuse lead to
two. 45-43. Just as they had done
against Pitt at the field house on Jan.
the Redmen. utilizing primarily their
starting five. were able to come back

“In the first half. nothing was going
right." Tarnesecca said. “We were
looking for a hole to crawl into. but we
had the ability to come back. That is

Page 11

the one characteristic of this crew: con-
sistency‘. We get behind. we come
back."

Rowanfs I-1-foot jumper from the
right baseline capped the comeback.
and won the game for the Redmen. It
was a sight all too familiar for Pitt
basketball fans. Rowan did the same
thing to the Panthers in that Jan. 25
game. Pitt led by 12. 40-28. at halftime
ofthat game. but eventually lost 68-67.
Rowan‘s jumper with a tninute left.‘
from about the same spot as the one he
hit Saturday night to beat Syracuse.
sealed the Panthers‘ fate that afternoon.
He was quick to compare after the
game.

“The shot that immediately comes
to mind is the one I hit at Pitt." Rowan.
a native of Beaver Falls. said.

Rowan is one of the starters who
works overtime for St. John’s. All
year. Carnesecca has lived and died
with Rowan. Berry. junior Willie
Glass. senior Mark Jackson and
sophomore Shelton Jones. With a slew
of players redshirted. the Redmen on-
ly carry nine players on their roster.
Against Syracuse. Jackson and Glass
played the entire game. Rowan sat for
one minute. Berry for two minutes. and
Jones sat for six minutes. That is the
reason the surprise of the game came
from St. John's reserve center Marco
Baldi.

A native of Italy. Baldi has seen very
limited action this year. as have the rest
of his benchmates. When the call came
Saturday night. Baldi answered. im-
pressively at that. He scored six points.
including four clutch free throws. and
drew Syracuse center Rony Seikaly‘s
fifth foul. disqualifying Seikaly from
the game.

“He really played well." Carnesecca
said of Baldi. “They are celebrating in
Milan right now."

“Who was that guy?" Syracuse head
coach Jim Boeheiin added humorous-
ly. "Was he on my scouting report?“

Baldi and the Redmen now head to
the NCAAs. as does Syracuse. St.
John‘s record is now 30-4. while
Syracuse’s dropped to‘ 25-5.

Panthers not done; accept NITbid

By Randy Miller
Assistant Sports Editor

The Pitt basketball team struggled
through a disappointing 15-13 season.
but their season was extended for at
least one more game when the squad
was invited and accepted a bid yester-
day evening to participate in the Na-
tional Invitational Tournament.

The Panthers will travel to
Springfield. Mo.. for a first—round
game with Southwest Missouri State.
a member of the AMCU VIII Con-
ference. Wednesday night. Southwest
Missouri State is 22-7 on the year.
They finished behind conference chain-
pion Cleveland State.

“We are more than pleased to accept
a bid to participate in the NIT." Bo/.ik
said. “We were happy to be included
in the tournament."

Bozik said Pitt would also accept a
home game if it were offered. The
manner in which the 32—field tourna-
ment works is that the first three rounds
are played with one team having a
home-field advantage. The semifinals
and ﬁnals are played in New York City
at Madison Square Garden. Pitt sold
out Fitzgerald Field House when it
hosted Notre Dame in a third-round
NIT game two years ago.

"We have no influence whatsoever
over whom we play." Bozik said.
“And I have no idea at this time if we
will get a home game. But I can say
that we would like to have a home
game."

Pitt basketball publicist Kimball
Smith later said that should the Pan-
thers win their first-round game. the
possibility of playing the second game
at Fitzgerald Field House would be
strong.

While the Panthers aren't exactly
jumping for joy over the NIT invita-
tion. Pitt head coach Roy Chipman
must feel relieved that his squad has
another chance to prove they were wor-
thy of the high expectations they had
this year.

Last season. with a team that started
two freshmen. the Panthers surprised
many by winning 17 games and receiv-
ing a bid for the prestigious NCAA
Tournament.

The Panthers exited the tournament
quickly after being blown away in a
first-round match—up with Louisiana
Tech. Pitt had higher expectations this
season. With Charles Smith and
Demetreus Gore returning as sopho-
mores and the additions of high school
All—America Jerome Lane and junior
college star Tico Cooper. Pitt was
counting on an NCAA bid this season

~ and hoping it could survive at least
a few rounds in the 64-team field.
The Panthers started the season play-
ing like they could beat the nation’s
best teams. They waltzed to a 9-2 start
that included a win over Georgetown
in the Big East conference opener.

Everything was going right for Pitt.
This was to be the year Pitt would
challenge the big boys in the Big East.
With Smith and Gore leading the way.
Pitt seemed well on its way to the
NCAAs.

However. the Pitt team that was an
eyelash away from a national ranking
suddenly vanished. The frustration
began after Pitt lost a couple of tough
road games to St. John's and Syracuse.
The Panthers struggled in home wins
over Boston College and Providence.
two ofthe weaker teams in the league.
Then the bottom fell out on a cold

Saturday evening in Pittsburgh. Seton

Hall. the Big East’s cellar dweller for

years. shocked the Panthers 85-73.
The drought continued with losses on

the road to Connecticut. Providence"

and Boston College.

Many excuses were given for the
Panthers’ inconsistent play. Some said
Pitt lacked a point guard while others
said Smith wasn‘t playing up to his
potential as his average dipped from 20
to 15 points per game. Others blamed
Chipman. who announced in the mid-
dle of the season that he would retire
at the close of the year.

Whatever the cause, the Panthers
played poor basketball the second half
of the season and didn’t look im-
pressive until last Thursday’s one—point
loss to Georgetown in the Big East
Tournament's first round.

Chipman was unavailable for com-
ment on the NIT bid last night.

Gymnasts beaten at OSU

By Julia Stitely
Staff Writer

The Panther gymnasts lost to defend-
ing national champions Ohio State
University 277.5—260.95 on Saturday.
That score, however, is “very respect-
able against this team." according to
Pitt head coach Frank D’Amico.

The Panthers were not intimidated.
despite the tough challenge facing
them. “They felt confident. and they
showed it." D‘Amico said. “The
crowd and judges were receptive to us.
Usually Ohio States a tough place to
go.
A lack of depth. the problem that’s
plagued the team all year. cost the Pan-
thers this meet too. Ohio State was get-
ting nines from nearly every gymnast
in their lineup. whereas Pitt can count
on nines only from its top three gym-
nasts. "Our first three guys were just
as good as theirs. This has been our
problem all year. This is the biggest
difference in depth I‘ve ever had. You
can’t win meets with that big of a dif-
ference,” D‘Amico said.

Pitt had its usual strong perform-
ances from the trio of Mark Klafter,
Matt Peters and Jorge Sanchez. Klafter
and Sanchez went one and two on the
floor exercise with scores of 9.65 and
9.55, respectively. The 9.55 was the
highest score on floor for Sanchez this
year. Sanchez also tied an OSU gym-
nast for first place on the vault with a
9.35.

Klafter finished second on both the
still rings and the parallel bars with
scores of 9.35 and 9.50. D’Amico was
pleased with the performance of the en-
tire team on both events. “We had
nothing but eights and nines,” he said.

Mike Mealie paced the Panthers on
pommel horse by tying for second
place with an 8.90.

again for Pitt. Klafter tied for first place
with a 9.50 but other routines included

   

State last weekend.

falls. Peters missed a brand new move
in his routine. “We just added it this
week,” D’Amico said, “but the crowd
loved his routine, applauding.”

The high bar ﬁnished Sanchez’s meet
on a sour note. On his dismount, he
twisted his ankle as he landed partly on
the mat and partly on the floor. Ac-
cording to D’Amico. Sanchez could not
walk on the foot after the meet. San-
chez is questionable for the Penn State
meet this Friday — that could make a
steep road to victory even steeper for
the Panthers. “It’ll be tough without
Jorge. ljust cross my finers on that

boy,” D’Amico said.

The meet against Penn State, who
finished third at last year’s NCAA
Championships. will be the Panthers’
last home meet of the season. It will
also be the last home meet for Klafter
and Peters, Pitt’s standout duo. The
meet will be important if the pair hope
to repeat as NCAA qualifiers. Neither
can afford to let their season averages
slip at the end of the season. “Only five
or six people get to go on each event
in the East,” D’Amico said. “We
won’t know who’s actually made it un-
til next week.”

Women miss goal;
fall in Columbus

By Julia Stitely
Staff Writer

The Lady Panther gymnasts just
missed their goal of 180 points as
they lost to Ohio State University
Saturday. 185.75-178.65. That
score is Pitt's highest score this
season. and thus. nothing to sneeze
at. All the same. it was "pretty
upsetting to come that close to 180
points and miss it. " Pitt head coach
Donna Sanft said. Pitt lost three
points because of falls.

Ohio State. the top team in the
region. won every event. They took
the first four places on vault. de—
spite one of the Lady Panthers’ best
performances all season on that
event. Pitt scored 45.8 with Alisa
Spector leading the way with a
9.40. That was good for a fifth
place for Spector. The other Pitt
scores were 9.2. 9.15. 9.05 and
9.0.

The Lady Panthers hit four out
of six uneven bars routines.
although registering only one score
above nine. Bars was “better than
we‘ve been doing," Sanft said,
“but we still need improvement.”

Spector was Pitt’s top gymnast
on bars. placing second with a
9.35. Pitt’s other scores were near-
ly identical: 8.8, 8.85, 8.8, 8.8 and
8.0.

Beam was a problem for Pitt
again. Three routines were made
and three were not. “I know we’re
going to be spending a lot more
time on beam in practice,” Sanft
said.

Spector was once again Pitt’s top
performer, scoring 9.1 to finish
third behind two OSU gymnasts.

. Freshmen Trish Aser and Stephanie

Megill were Pitt’s next best per-
formers with scores of 8.6. Beam
was Pitt’s lowest event total, only
43.15.

Pi ut on another stron show

on floor exercise, scoring 45.10.
This was not enough to top Ohio
State though. as Nina Dziem scored
a meet—high 9.6 for OSU Spector
tied OSU’s Patty Monaghan for
fourth with a 9.15.

The rest of Pitt‘s ﬂoor lineup put
in strong routines. with Kim
Calderone and Kristy Pieters both
scoring 9.05. Freshmen Megill and
Aser scored 8.95 and 8.9. respec-
tively. while Beth Waters was close
behind with an 8.8.

L Roth Sanft and assistant coach

“I know we ’re going to
be spending a lot more
time on beam in practice. ”

— Donna Sanft

_ 2 .m. in Trees Hall.

   

Louie Liguori mentioned the fact
that three Pitt gymnasts hit their
double-back somersaults on floor
exercises. Megill’s was her first of
the season.

Alisa Spector was the highlight
of the meet for Pitt. She won the
all—around competition, scoring a
career high 37.00. Ohio State took
the next three places with scores of
36.65, 36.4 and 36.15. Pieters and
Waters scored 35.55 and 35.00 for
Pitt.

Right now, Spector’s chances for
the NCAA Championships look
good. “Regionals will make the
difference,” Sanft said. Qualifica-
tion depends on two—thirds of the
gymnast‘s score at regionals and
one—third of the gymnast’s season
average. Spector’s score Saturday
certainly boosted her season
average.

Never A Cover

As I see it

Picture this scene: Someone has just
said something less than complimen-
tary to the neighborhood bully.
Everyone knows what will follow as
they form a circle about the two men.

People are naturally fascinated with
this. the most natural and basic form
of human competition. It is the only ac-
tivity in which you compete using on-
ly what God gave you. Neither com-
petitor can have the advantage of a
piece of equipment that is the genius
of a third party. Your weapons are your
own fists.

Barbaric? What about football
players who use very hard helmets to
try and shatter an opponent’s rib cage
or cripple him for life? Believe me,
boxing is a very tame sport.

Whoever got the idea to stage these
contests and make money off of them
was a genius. Boxing has grossed as
much as $20. $30, or even $35 million
for a single night's action.

Tonight’s fight between Marvelous

Marvin Hagler and John “The Beast”
Mugabi should gross a fair amount. But
surprisingly enough. this fight has not
gotten nearly as much publicity as box-
ing’s last superfight. Hagler vs.
Hearns. This could prove to be the big-
gest factor in the fight.
Very few people are giving Mugabi
even the slightest chance of wresting
the title from Hagler. In fact. there are
still many people who aren’t even sure
who The Beast is. It should be noted.
however. that Jimmy Jacobs, probably
the world’s foremost boxing authori-
ty, has predicted a Mugabi knockout.
He is among the minority.

The boxing public seems to think that
because Hagler manhandled Thomas
Hearns. he is indestructible. In reali-
ty. any decent fighter could have
defeated Hearns in that specific fight.
Hearns was consistently beating
Hagler to the punch during the first half
of the first round of their fight. He was
hammering the champion. But then
Hearns injured his hand -— and proved
to be a heartless fighter, as he more or
less gave up. The ﬁght was over at that
point. Hearns is an extremely physi-
cally-talented fighter, one of the best
in the world. But when a fighter doesn’t
have heart, he cannot deal with adver-
sity. After the injury. Hearns was
nothing more than a punching bag.
Mugabi will not be the same.

In Hagler’s fight against Roberto
Duran. he showed that his reﬂexes

were leaxing him as Duran landed

more punches than had Hagler‘s last
five or six opponents combined. If it
were not for that unwritten law that the
champion is supposed to be awarded
all of the close rounds by’ the judges.
Duran would‘ve won the fight. Hagler
is not the fighter that he used to be.
There are even those who feel that he
peaked around the time that he won the
title. For those of you who do not know
the Hagler story. he was feared as a
contender, and his title shot when it
finally came was very. very long
overdue.

In recent years. Hagler has hurt
himself by fighting very seldomly.
Considering how easy some of his
fights have been. he should have been
fighting four or five times per year.
Because of this. Hagler has lost that
sharpness that was once his trademark.
Fighting always seemed a natural ac-
tivity for him. Such is not the case
anymore.

Mugabi has been keeping himself
busy, that is, up until this fight. It’s
been a long time since either man has
been in the ring, but Mugabi has been
taking more fights in the last two years.
This is a major factor for a brawling-
type fight. which this promises to be.
If one man is off his game and the other
isn’t, we could see a first—or second-
round knockout.

It is my opinion that we may be look-
ing at the greatest middleweight since
Carlos Monzon. in John “The Beast”
Mugabi. He has all of the physical
tools: power. decent hand speed,
stamina, a good chin and very good
fighting instincts.

Mugabi has not yet reached his peak.
One year from now, he will be
unbeatable. The question is: “Is he
ready for greatness now?” I’m sure
that The Marvelous One will have
something to say about the subject.

A “Dream Fight” is a round—by-
round prediction of what would hap-
pen if two selected men would fight
each other. This popular feature among
boxing fans is usually reserved for im-
possible fights that could never take
place (Example: Ali vs. Louis). But
just for fun’s sake. here”s my predic-
tion of the March 10 bout.

0 Round One:’ Hagler comes straight
to Mugabi in center ring and begins
working on the jab. He lands two stiff

 ‘The Pitt"New.'s.' M’-nail’ 101 1986

By Jim Brueckner

Hagler may not be Marvelous tonight

left hooks. Mugabi is stirprisingl)‘
cautious. Mugabi lands a few unevent-
ful punches. and the round ends with
Hagler as the aggressor. Hagler’s
round 10-9.

0 Round Two: Hagler staggers
Mugabi early with a left book, but
Mugabi recovers quickly and slows
Hagler’s charge with a straight right.
The pace slows for a few seconds. but
the last minute of the round has the
crowd on its feet. Mugabi gets the best
of the exchange and finishes by landing
two lefts and a right cross. Mugabi’s
round l0-9. A

0 Round Three: Mugabi is caught
off-balance. and Hagler scores a flash
knockdown with a right hook. Hagler
senses victory and throws punches
relentlessly. looking for the early
knockout. Mugabi is not hurt badly and
is able to slip or block almost every
punch of the flurry. until a left hook
catches him flush at the bell. Hagler’s
round 10-8.

0 Round Four: Hagler is winded.
and Mugabi utilizes his underrated box-
ing skills to jab and hook his way
through this round. It is the calm before
the storm. Mugabi’s round 10-9.

0 Round Five: Refreshed, Hagler
decides to trade punches with Mugabi
at center ring. They are fighting at a
furious pace. and the crowd leaps to its
feet. Mugabi catches Hagler with a
right hook flush on the chin, buckling
the champions knees. Hagler clutches
and manages to smother most of the en-
suing onslaught. Mugabi shakes him
loose and scores with a thundering
overhand right, and Hagler goes down
for a count of four. Mugabi lands two
more rights but misses with everything
else. Mugabi‘s round 10-8.

0 Round Six: The rounds first 30
seconds are uneventful until Hagler
snaps Mugabi’s head with a straight
left. But Mugabi is not hurt. and as
Hagler charges in, Mugabi almost takes
his head off withja left of his own.
Hagler is in trouble. Mugabi scores
three jabs. two crosses and another left
hook. Hagler fights back, and Mugabi
counters a right hook attempt with an
overhand right that sends Hagler down
and out!

“The winner by a knockout at two
minutes, 47 seconds of the sixth round.
and new. undisputed middleweight
champion of the world - John “The
Beast” Mugabi!”

with a 7.9 rpg average. eighth in field
goal percentage (52.4 percent) and
third in blocked shots (40).

David finished seventh in assists with
a 4.4 apg average. and Curtis Aiken
finished tenth (3.4 apg).

In team statistics. Pitt finished high
or in the middle of all catagories ex-
cept free—throw shooting. where the
Panthers finished eighth (68 percent as
a team). Connecticut was the only team
that finished lower, shooting 67.2 per-
cent from the free throw line.
