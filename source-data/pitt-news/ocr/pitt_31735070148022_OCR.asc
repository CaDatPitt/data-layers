Director
of        
austerity
hired

 Dscar Bergman
Senior Policy Analyst

Gage Plum, the University’s incom-
ing Director of Austerity, has been

. saving things since his childhood in

rural Nebraska.

“Stamps, baseball cards, cereal
box tops, string, glass, nails, tele-
phone cords,‘ animal skeletons,
pencil shavings — you name it and
I’ve hoarded it,” said Plum, who even
lied to The Pitt News about his age
in order to keep those extra years
for himself.

Pitt students just hope the new
director can save them a few dol-
lars on their tuition bills. Lastnight,
an. administration news release
announced that Pitt will contract
Plum’s services for an undetermined
amount of time, effective Aug. 30.

“I’ve gotbig plans for this dump.
We’re going to cut costs until there
aren’t any left,” Plum said. A

A slight, unassuming man who
wears shabby secondhand clothes
and cuts his own hair, Plum gained
a name for himself as a turnaround
expert at various Fortune 500 com-
panies.

“I’d come in, take a look at the
bills and the payroll and then reduce
them. The way you slash the electric-
ity bill is by not using any. The best
means of keeping salaries down is by
not paying any. So when you think
about it, adark warehouse with no
workers in it is the ideal,” he said.

His methods were controversial,
though, and his dream of creating
a company that generated pure
proﬁt without producing goods or
employing people never came to
fruition. ,

Facing steep budget cuts, Pitt
has offered Plum a second chance
to make a great ﬁrst impression.

Graduation now   kegger celebration

“University will thrown down this May to remedy its dire ﬁnancial situation

Sarah Simkin
Unpaid Intern

Faced with unprecedented budget
cuts, the University will substitute

the traditional graduation cer-

emony with a paid—entry college
party — or, in popular terminol-
ogy, a “kegger.”

“What better way for our stu-
dents to celebrate the end of their
college careers than the way they
celebrated every Thursday, Friday

and Saturday, during their edu--

cations?” asked Lola Fisher, vice
provost of the newly created Rev-
elry Allocations Department.
“Between our focus group
discussions and e-mail surveys,
I think we’ve discovered that most
students show up drunk anyway,”
she continued. Fisher and her
team of several dozen research-
ers and administrative assistants
launched plans for the gradua-
tion kegger as soon as the news
of potential budget cuts broke in
mid-March. '
The University collaborated

This year’s graduation ceremony will include kegs f Natty Light,Natty Ice

with some of the ﬁnest minds

in party planning, including the_

people behind several successful

fraternities and that one house

party on Semple Street.

“I mean, we’ll still have our
own party at the house, but we
were happy to assist the Univer-
sity, especially since they took
us off double-secret-probation
in exchange for our consultation
services,”-said Mark “Shotgun
Champion” Bro, the Delta Tau
Chi social chair.

Special blue-and-metallic-
beige Solo cups have been pur-
chased for the event. Other.deco-
rations will be kept to a minimum,
however, because, in Bro’s words,
they would be “too much effort.”

I-land markings -— either rub-
ber stamps depicting the Univer-
sity’s beloved Panther mascot or
wildly slashed Sharpie X’s —
will be available at the Petersen
Events Center’s lobby entrance
or through Concourse A.

Admission is tentatively priced
at $500 for guys, $300 for girls.

Mark Nordenberg said, noting
that the University doesn’t have
enough money to honor the tradi-
tion of women drinking free.

Oﬂicials will admit graduates
who have paid $56,000 over a
four-year period, as well as any-
one who can demonstrate proof
that they “know a guy.”

Outside the Classroom Cur-
riculum credit will be available
to all attending underclassmen
at swiping stations located in the
food court. The credit is expected
to wipe out‘ all requirements in
the program’s “Appreciation of
the Arts” category.

Doors will open at 11 a.m. on
May 1, but it’s unlikely that any-
one will show up before 1 p.m.
Jell-O shots will be available for
$125 each at all concession stands
—' $100 if payment is made with
Panther Funds. Dining Dollars
cannot be used. .

Mirrors will be temporar-
ily removed from bathrooms to
discourage lingering. We’ve also
hidden anything breakable or
valuable,” said Hugo Gral, coor-

and Keystne Light in plae of diplomas.

V University ofﬁcials decided to
change the graduation speaker
to appropriately reﬂect the new
tone of the event. The famously
college—loving Asher Roth will
now serve as the class of 2011’s
commencement speaker —— or
rather, commencement rapper.

Academic regalia will be dis-
couraged in favor of SempleFest
T-shirts and clothing bearing the
slogan “The Cathedral of Learn-
ing: Guiding Drunk Kids Home
Since 1934.”

In anticipation of the hang-
overs likely to follow the Uni-
versity—wide commencement

. ceremony, all individual school

graduation recognition events
have been canceled or replaced
with pancake breakfasts on Mon-
day morning. Commemorative
sunglasses will be available at the
‘Pitt Shop and it is recommended
that students and their families
consider stocking up on aspirin
at one of the several drugstores
located near campus. a

Ke$ha might not seem like the

Hector McDougal, head of the

“She met me and saw my face

But there’s more than that,
Ke$ha said. The lady who makes

Wiz donates to anti—drug charities

Glamorous C. Bannana
Minister of Propaganda

Pittsburgh rapper Wiz Khalifa
announced Thursday that he will
donate his $10,000—a—month mar-
ijuana budget to the Ray Y. Bees
Foundation for a Less-Drug-Driven
America.

The artist —— famous for tracks
like the Pittsburgh—inspired an-
them “Black and Yellow” and his
new album Rolling Papers — has
been reaching out to support sev-
eral diverse organizations promot-
ing public welfare, including the
aforementioned Bees foundation,
and Tall Trees Unlimited in promo-
tion of nature conservation.

Khalifa’s support has taken

the form of more than just mon-
etary donations, however. He has
recently been featured in public
service announcements for the
organizations.

“Black stripe, yellow paint,”
Khalifa raps in one of the an-
nouncements, “without grass,
burgers taste the same.”

But what could have made the
Woodie Award-winning rapper
switch his career track from mix-
tapes and popular singles to fea-
ture gigs for government—funded
initiatives?

“You know how you can license
a dead celebrity’s image? It’s kind
of like that,” he said while wear-
ing a T—shirt of Pat Boone, a singer
who reinterpreted blues songs to

. remove explicit content. “And any— _

way, it’s not like [those organiza-
tions] don’t know what’s ﬂy  have
you ever seen how many hipsters
wear D.A.R.E. shirts?”

"Longtime fan and half-credit I

Pitt student Fratzen C. Brohemian
had apfew concerns when heheard
about the change in direction.

“I’m not sure if nature conser-
vation and anti—drug campaign-
ing is the kind of thing I want my
record—buying dollars going to,”
he said.

“As my fans know,” Khalifa re-
sponded via his Xanga, “I’ve always
loved trees.”

ecutive special vice adviser to Chan-
cellor Mark Nordenberg. “We were

Gage Plum came in with this radical
plan for pay toilets, no-ﬂow sinks,
toll sidewalks,‘ rent-by-the-hour

the students — it was nothing short
of amazing.” - .

“It’s the beginning of a new age

sities, like the University of Phoe-
nix Online. Did you know that U of
Phoenix paid to put its name on a
stadium? And they don’t even have
any sports teams! That’s where Pitt
needs to be.”

The plan

Plum’s vision for the University
includes a bold new way of utilizing
all of the buildings that he refers to
as “wasted space.”

“Look, who needs the library?

just a bunchof dusty old books and
kids in sweatpants playing Farmville
and Facebooking in there. You could
replace that entire thing with one
reﬁirbished Internet kiosk that rtms
Windows 95 and has access to Proj-
ect Gutenberg. They’ve got most of
the books up to 1920,.._I think.”

Plum’s austerity  also calls
for asigniﬁcant reduction in the size
of Pitt’s faculty. . L ' . 

“Mr. Plum decided to trim the
psychology departmient down to
one person and hold 50,00o—stu—
dent classes at Heinz Field. The kids
can watch the PowerPoint presenta-
tion up on the big scoreboard, which
ought to be a lot of fun. If everything
goes as expected, we can schedule all
the survey classes in there, one right
after the other,” Jammy said.

Speaking for _the faculty, Dr.

Jonas Ruggleteapot, distinguished
professor of learning, was not so
enthused.

dance, Plum plans to put some of
those pay-for-class funds toward a
lottery drawing. You can’t win if you
don’t show up!”

The future

While savoring the contents of a
mayonnaise jar ﬁlled with coffee that
he’d prepared using thrice-brewed
grounds, Plum contemplated Pitt’s
future._

“I read somewhere they invented
the polio vaccine at Pitt. But how
much money did they make off
that? If they’d let me market that
vaccine, I could have earned tril-
lions of dollars for them. We’re not
performing charity work here, you
know,” he said. .

Pitt undergraduate Emily Twigg
met the news of these drastic chang-
es with indifference.

“Who cares? They raise the
tuition here every year. So maybe
I’ll have to pay by the minute for
my showers, but it’s not like I even
shower during ﬁnals week, anyway.
Plus, I can win big in the ‘Come to
Class’ lottery, so it all might work
out in the end.”

With all of Plum’s austerity mea-
sures in place, tuition is expected to
increase by a mere $2,000 for the
2011-12 academic year. V

- “It’s a hell of a deal, when you
think about it,” observed “Dusty”
Rhodes. “You can’t even buy a good
used car for $2,000.”

Roc   might haveto repopulate panther species

Olivia Garber
Da Shiznit

The fate of the eastern cougar.
now rests in the loins of Roc the
Panther.

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service, a federal "government
agency within the Department of
the Interior, declared the eastern
cougar extinct earlier this month,
but recently approached Chancel-
lor Mark Nordenberg to see if he

would feel comfortable letting Roc _ 

out to stud.

Faced with impending budget
cuts proposed by Gov. Tom Cor-
bett, Nordenberg quickly agreed,

"citing the $80 million compensa-

tion the University would receive
per act of luv—making.

After a series of tests that as.-
sessed the virility, motility and pH
level of Roc’s biznat, the Wildlife
Service concluded that Roc was a
“he-man studpoker,” according to

. the report.

' Because Roc is the sole survivor
of the eastern cougar subspecies,

4 really smart scientists have de-

cided to breed Roc with females
of other subspecies of cougars to

create a new, stronger breed.

The ﬁrst cougar on Roc’s “to do
list” is Penn State’s Nittany Lion.

When Pitt‘ and Penn State re-
ceived word of the imminent in-
tercourse,'outrage ignited across
both campuses.

Pitt’s Student Government

 

Board abandoned its “If you cut

our funding” project, changing
part of the sentence to become

“If you breed our panther.”

General responses included,
“If you breed our panther, future
generations will be watered down

for money,

  

to weak copies of what once was a
majestic beast,” and “If you breed
our panther, I will transfer.”

SGB president Maureen Bieber

said that the Pitt administration '

was essentially whoring out Roc
“This-ilsn’t even consensual,”
she said. “Let’s;whore out the ad-

T . ministrators forlmoney instead. Oh

wait, no one would pay for tha .”
Pitt admi__nistrators’ only re-

' sponse tojthe outcry was a mass
e—mail explaining that part of the  -
‘ breeding agreement included a re— 
. instate_‘ment_of the legendary Pitt "
vs. Penn State football.  
"little to'_a15péas;e-

   

  

. ‘ _  aPitt 
- said the thought of Roc bumpin’
' uglies with the Nittany Lion was

“repulsive” and “against every-
thing I stand for.”
“How can they even make ba-

bies? Isn’t the Nittany Lion a boy?” '

she said, tears of frustration leak-
ing out of forlorn eyeballs.

That question is a popular
query, as most of Pitt’s students
believed that Penn State’s mascot
was indeed a male. But contrary
to popular belief, the Nittany Lion
— also known as Nit —— is a female
pussycat.

Roc has undergone several”
exercise programs to maximize
his sexual prowess. In addition
to pilates and yoga, Roc has also
been reading up on Cougar Kama
Sutra. ‘

“He’s learning really fast,” said‘?-
sex trainer Barbarella McGee. “His
thrusts are really strong, but he
still needs to work on stamina.

“He also tends to miss baskets

in the ﬁnal seconds of the game -
so to speak,” she said.
McGee also has Roc watching

hours of “cougar porn.” The view-

. ing of videos depicting cougars en-

gaging in coitus is similar to strate-
gies practiced by_ a pandapbreeding _
center in China, except those use

, pandas instead of cougars.

The ﬁrst conjugal date has been ll

- pushed back multiple times be-

cause Nit keeps complaining of a
“headache,” but both teams say the

ﬁrst mating should be soon. Cur-

rently, Roc and Nit have already

engaged in preliminary “get to

know each other” meetings.

“So far, they haven’t gotten
much done besides some initial
sniffs,” said Dr. Marly Davidson,
one of the really smart scientists

.- conducting the experiment. She .

said that the team is hoping for

Keith Gillogly‘

The Overachiever

When That Guy arrived 35 minutes
late to his 8 a.m. class Thursday
morning, he took his usual seat
in the very back row of the lecture
hall and_ began asking around if
anyone did the homework so he
could copy a few answers. It turns
out he didn’t have a pen either.
“Yeah I slept in a bit. It’s what-
evs. I didn’t sleep much last week

' cause I was up every night putting

the last touches on my essay for
the Outstanding College Character
award,” he said.

The sleepless nights paid off.
That Guy was recently announced
the winner of the 2011 Outstanding
College Character award given for
demonstrating outstanding char-
acter throughout his lifetime.

The College Character Board,
a national organization, receives
thousands of applications each
year, and That Guy said it was

“pretty sweet” to have been se-
lected. ‘ ‘
The application involved writ-
ing an essay outlining the appli-
cant’s great character. That Guy
said he lifted most of the essay
‘right from his ro'ommate’s com-
’ puter screen -— the roommate was

tences about that experience that

also applying for the award —— be-
fore deleting the document.

“Shh. Don’t tell,” That Guy
said. _

' But some of his application was
original material, he said.

“I had just a few little kinks on
my record with the police, and I
had to do some volunteering. I
ended up working with mentally

in his everyday life, but some who
know him well aren’t sure he’s the
role-model student he portrayed
in his essay.

His former girlfriend, Pitt ju-
nior Pooki, described his character
as anything but outstanding. Even
when they were together, she said,
he often refused to pay her any at-
tention.

“Like he’d carry a guitar pick in
his wallet, and whenever we were
at a party and there were some
girls around he’d ﬁnd a guitar and
startplaying ‘Wonderwall,’” ‘she
said.

That wasn’t That Guy’s only dis-
play of egregious social behavior.

“We had this really nice din-
ner planned and then he forgot
his credit card, and he only had
like $5 in'his wallet so we had to
get a pizza,” she said. “I ate like
three pieces and then he told me
I was fa .” '

But it was That Guy who chose
to end their relationship by text

a message a few weeks ago. He didn’t

go into the details about his mo-
tives.

“I have needs, and she just
wasn’t fulﬁlling them. Youknow
what I mean, brah?” he said.

That Guy’s roommate, Pitt ju-
nior Ron Weezly, complained that
he leaves laundry in the dryer “all
the freaking time.”

“I went to do my laundry, and

wins national character award at Pitt

That Guy_’s clothes were still in the
washing machine from last week,”
Weezly said. “I really needed some
clean socks because That Guy kept
taking them from my drawer after
his ﬁfth week of not doing laun-
dry.”

Weezly was last seen shout-
ing “Wingardium Leviosa” while
pointing fruitlessly at the wash-
ing machine. He didn’t have any
socks on.

That Guy’s mother, Sandra Guy,
reports tension in their relation-
ship ever since That Guy started
exceeding his text messaging
limit each month. She still pays
his phone bill.

“I really try to keep him as No.
1 in my heart, even though that

‘ number is roughly also his GP .”

Included in the award was a
$100 prize. That Guy said he con-

. sidered using the extra money to

pay off his phone bill forvhis mom,

but he quickly changed his mind.
“Nah. I think I’ll just go buy a

bunch of Red Bulls,” he said. I

said. 7

Montgomery also shares an-
other quality with the pop star
that could help her in achieving
the $chol@r$h*p — she and
Ke$ha have the same genetic
disorder that causes them to
sweat glitter.

Ke$ha has long been applaud- ‘

ed and criticized for her appar-
ently excessive sparkle use, but
the singer recently came out and

stated that she suffers from a dis-
ease — Twinkle’s 84th Chromo-
some Disorder — that converts
moisture in her body to glitter.

Montgomery can relate to
the struggles of growing up
with Twinkle’s 84, as she refers
to it.

“I mean, I got called all kinds I

of names: ‘sparkle sweat,’ .‘the
twinkling weirdo’  the worst
was ‘disco misfit.’ That one al-
ways hurt’ most,” she said.

But Ke$ha has come to em-
brace Twinkle’s 84 as a part of
her persona and her life.

“We R who we R,” she said of
people like her andMontgom-
ery, going on to note that this
is exactly why the $ch0l@r$h*p
exists — to give students like
3dith Montgomery a chance to
be themselves. .

Man

dies

from fall

Michael Macagnone
News Editor

The man who fell four stories
through a Petersen Events Center
windowduring a concert Wednes-
day night died early Thursday
morning.

Joseph Kimutis, a 19-year-old
man from McDonald, Pa., died
shortly after‘ midnight yesterday,
three hours after falling through
a fourth story window, according
to the Allegheny County medical
examiner.

Kimutis fell through a window
above the Events Center’s ticket
office in front of DeSoto Street,
across from the University’s Scaife
Hall. He had been attending a con-
cert by the group Furthur, which
features two former Grateful Dead
member.

City police Lt. Daniel Herrmann
said Wednesday that some wit-
nesses told him they saw Kimutis
go into a football stance and say
“hike” before running through
the window shortly after 9 p.m.
He could not say whether those
reports were true.

Some people posted differing
accounts on Furthur’s website.

One user, Kryskros, posted
that Kimutis windmilled his arms
and pumped his legs before diving
through the window.

“All of this crap about getting
into a three point stance and say-
ing ‘hike’ NEVER HAPPENED...He
did not say anything,” Kryskros
said.

A woman crashed ai hiclemiinto
the Barco Law Building yester-
day shortly after 10 p.m., leaving
her dark Ford SUV embedded in
the concrete wall facing Forbes
Avenue.

Scattered piles of debris
marked the path the woman
drove. Witnesses said the vehicle
came out of the Towers garage,
heading straight toward David
Lawrence Hall and the Barco Law
Building. a

The scraps of black plastic
left behind made it look as if the
woman had driven between two
concrete pillars about 15 feet
apart, straight through a nar-
row space between the curve of
David Lawrence and another pil-
lar about 10 feet away, and then
down the nearby stairs before
making impact with the Barco
Law Building.

A gaping hole outlined the
front of the vehicle, with the
SUV’s bumper penetrating the
concrete wall.

“Laws of physics,” EMS Dis-
trict Chief Steve Carlson said
when describing what happened.
“Two objects can’t occupy the
same place.”

Sgt. Sam Salvio of the Pitt po-
lice said the vehicle went through
the wall into an office space. No
one was in the office when the
vehicle crashed, he said.

Salvio said that .“.big blocks of

Daylight
robbery

in North
Oakland

Michael Macagnone
News Editor

A man robbed a Carnegie Mellon
student in broad daylight yester-
day about a block from Chancellor
Mark Nordenberg’s house in North
Oakland, CMU police said.

The student was not harmed
during the incident on Devonshire
Street, and city police took over
the investigation of the incident.
Pitt spokesman John Fedele said
that Pitt police were aware of the
crime and would work with city
police on any investigation.

The incident caused CMU po-

lice to issue a crime alert yester-
day afternoon, although the event
occurred several blocks from the
campus. The following account
comes from the alert:

At 10:24 a.m. Thursday a red
Saturn stopped next to the student
walking toward Fifth Avenue on
Devonshire Street. An African-
American suspect, described as
6 feet 3 inches tall with a stocky
build, stepped out of the car and
approached the victim.

The suspect showed a revolver
and demanded the victim’s valu-
ables. The suspect then ﬂed in the
vehicle toward Fifth Avenue. I

A building inspector arrived
last night to examine the build-
ing. An e-mail from Mary Cross-
ley, dean of the law school, said
the building was declared safe
and classes will run as normal
today.

He did not conﬁrm the age
of the woman driving the car, or
if she was a Pitt student. He did
say, however, that she was con-
scious and alert when paramed-
ics carried her out on a stretcher
at about 10:30 p.m.

Carlson said she was taken to
UPMC Presbyterian Hospital. Her

condition was not made public by

' midnight last night.

Kyle Deroner, a Pitt senior,
was in Towers Garage when he
saw the crash. Deroner, who was
also driving at the time, saw the
woman was about to leave the ga-
rage when she abruptly reversed.
The car then “ﬂoored it across
the street  and head-on into
the building,” he said.

When the car hit the Barco

Law Building, Ify Mkparu said ‘

she could feel a big “boom.”
The senior at Duquesne was
practicing for a fashion show

with Pitt’s African Students Or-
ganization. The group was inside
the lobby of David Lawrence Hall
when the accident occurred. ,
“First it was a boom,” she said.
She and several other women
from the group went outside to
see what had happened.
Mkparu said she saw a woman
step out of the car, staggering and

_ unsteady on her feet.

A police ofﬁcer later walked
over to Mkparu and the three
women she was with, asking if
they knew what had happened.
He questioned them about stories

The dark SUV crashed through a cement wall into judges’ chambersof the Barco Law Building, but no one was in the ofﬁces at the time.

that a male passenger had exited
the car and left the scene.

Mkparu told police that a
man came out of the passenger
side to check on the woman. He
then shook her — Mkparu said
it looked as if he was asking her
if she was OK.

Salvio did not know for cer-
tain last night whether a man had
in fact been inside the car. He
also said the cause of the accident
was “under investigation.”

The car was removed from the
building about 11:40 p.m. I

Pitt might recoup some money lostin alleged fraud

Michael Macagnone
News Editor

Pitt might get back some of the $70 million
investment it lost to an allegedly fraudulent
ﬁrm more than two years ago.

A federal judge ruled a little over a week
ago that the $815 million-recovered from
Westridge Capital Management Inc. should
be distributed to the corporation’s inves-
tors, though the ruling didn’t specify which
investors would receive money.

Pitt spokesman John Fedele said in a
statement yesterday that University ofﬁ-
cials are “pleased with the judge’s ruling,”
although Pitt might not receive money by

the April 20‘ date the judge set. Lawyers rep-
resenting the ﬁrm could request a stay, or
halt, in proceedings.

University officials had previously
guessed that Pitt could recover $35 mil-
lion, but did not provide an estimate yes-
terdays.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Com-
mission accused Paul Greenwood and Ste-
phen Walsh, the executives of the legally
embattled ﬁrm, of misappropriating $553
million companies had invested in their
business since 1996.

Pitt ofﬁcials have said the University in-
vested about $64 million in the company,
which had grown to a value of $70 million
by the time the SEC announced the case in

2009. A number of other universities, in-
cluding Carnegie Mellon, had also invested
money in the company. ,

Greenwood pleaded guilty. over the
summer, according to court documents.
At the time, he also signed an agreement
that would allow the court to distribute his
holdings to various investors who were af-
fected by the scheme.

Federal officials alleged that Greenwood
and Walsh, former owners of the New York
Islanders, had used Westridge’s money to
buy a home, cars and various other items
including rare books antd a teddy bear from
Sotheby’s, an auction house specializing in
high-end ﬁne art.

Walsh pleaded not guilty in the case.

Justin Sher, his attorney, said yesterday he
could not comment without approval from
his client. Greenwood’s attorneys could not
immediately be reached for comment on
the ruling.

The same year the Westridge proceed-
ing began, Pitt’s endowment decreased by
one-ﬁfth, from $2.3 billion to $1.8 billion,
according to the Chronicle of Higher Edu-
cation.

In February 2010, Pitt’s Board of Trust-
ees created an Audit Committee that would
oversee the University’s investments and

. make an annual report on the endowment.

The committee made its ﬁrst report last
October. I

Pitt holds 2011 Drag Show

Natalie Bell
Contributing Editor

By 4 p.m., Aron Stone had used glue sticks to
tame his eyebrows and was applying his ﬁrst
layer of foundation. He was well on his way
to_assuming his stage persona, Svetlana, for
the Pitt Drag Show.

“I think of her like another person. She’s
my alter ego,” the Pitt junior said of his drag
persona.

Each spring, drag kings and queens strut
their stuff— and often take it off — in front
of crowds of Pitt students. This marks the
15th year for the event sponsored by Pitt’s
Rainbow Alliance, an organization that sup-
ports the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender,
queer and allied community. Through the
show, the group raised $1,350 to beneﬁt the
Pittsburgh AIDS Task Force, which works to
prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS in the Pitts-
burgh community.

Performers began arriving in the William
Pitt Union at 3 p.m. to set up the stage and
catwalk in the Union’s assembly room and
begin to get into character.

Stone tamed his eyebrows so they were less
noticeable when he dabbed on his foundation
and white make-up. After that, he contoured
his face, using highlighting and rouge to make
his cheeks appear higher and his Adam’s apple
less noticeable. He then brightened his eyes
with pink and purple eye shadows —- to match
his dress, of course. He said his make-up usu-
ally takes about an hour.

For sophomore Hannah Solkowitz, who
turned herself into Sterling Quicksilver, the
change meant putting on a sports bra for bind-
ing, sporting a wig and facial hair — which
was cut from a wig and stuck on with spirit
gum —— as well as stuffing her pants.

“It’s so weird having something between
my legs,” Solkowitz said.

Several hours later, at 8:20 p.m., as the
drag kings and queens put on theirﬁnaltouch-
es, students waited in a line that snaked from
the auditorium doors into the Tansky Family
Lounge. ,

When the show began, Dominique DeVau-

er, formerly Da’Ho and aka Dempsey Young,
performed a strip tease to “Whip My Hair.”
With each garment removed — silver se-
quined vest, see-through top, bead-fringed
skirt — the audience cheered louder for the
2010 Pitt alum. Eventually she was down to
a bra and thong.

DeVauer introduced the event as the “You
did what with your genitals?” Show and
brought on the second of 16 acts, a group of
ﬁve kings dancing and lip—syncing to “F*ck
You.” i
The act included the second host of the
evening, Dylan Dickhersoon, akasenior Dylan
Drobish, who, after his number, explained
along with DeVauer the tipping etiquette for
the night.

The pair encouraged attendees to bring
dollar bills to the stage and put them in the
pants of the kings or the bras and underwear
of the queens. For those too shy to do either,
there were volunteers walking around with
bowls. The audience could also simply toss
money on the stage.

When she took the stage, Virginia “Ginger
Snaps” Snapplestein—DeVauer, aka Cody Bien-
kowski, the ﬁrst Pitt employee to come to the
stage for the show, lip-synced several songs
that constituted an ode to wealth. The drag
queen, who, when not in costume, works in
Pitt’s bulk mailing services, believes the drag
show demonstrates how open the LGBTQ
community is at Pitt.

“It lets students experience a part of gay
culture that’s just really fun to have,” she said
while getting ready backstage.

Her performance included “Diamonds
Are A Girl’s Best Friend,” “Rich Girl,” and “Big
Spender.” She sashayed down the stage in a
corset she’d restitched backstage and a gold
dress she’d crafted herself.

After that, there were strip teases, UV
body paint that glowed under black lights,
stuffed animal snakes pulled from pants and
commentary from the hosts that provoked-
laughter from the audience.

Christopher Crash, aka.Kelly Coburn, a Pitt
grad student, performed to “You Get What
You Give.”

As audience members brought money to
the stage, he grabbed their hands, looked
them in the eyes and sang song lyrics like,
“You’ve got a reason to live.” His take—home
message came at the end, when he held up a
sign that said “It gets better” on one side and
“Make it better” on the other. As he displayed
them, attendees cheered loudly.

The song came before DeVauer discussed
the night’s issue, which was in a similar veini
LGBTQ teen suicides. DeVauer discussed her
own problems with depression and bullying
growing up, as well as Drobish’s difﬁculties.
She also referenced columnist Dan Savage’s
It Gets Better Project — a movement that
established an online community that en-
courages LGBTQ teens with the message “It
Gets Better.”

The power of Christ com-
pels you

Quick, throw some holy water
on your computer! The Telegraph
reports that the Catholic Church
is seeing a rise in the demand for
exorcists because of an increase
in Internet-fueled Satanism. To
allow Pitt students to take advan-
tage of this growing job market,
the religious studies department
will begin offering a new certiﬁ-
cate in exorcism, starting Fall
2011. ‘

Fowl play

The Pitt News falsely report-
ed yesterday that the red-tailed
hawk on our front page was a fal-
con. Considering we observed
that the hawk made a squirrel
its prey and that falcons mostly
eat a diet of other birds, we could
use a feather-familiar friend. As a
result, The Pitt News is currently
accepting applications for the po-
sition of Staff Ornithologist.

Cool smarts vs. school
smarts

Sure, six of Pitt’s and Carnegie
Mellon’s brightest students were
put to shame by supercomputer
Watson in a game show Wednes-
day, but let’s be honest: Pitt is
totally better than CMU when
it comes to the good stuff. In a
category titled “White, White
Wine,” Pitt’s team swept the

board, showing its knowledge
of the libation. We wonder if out
of frustration with its team’s per-
formance, CMU will consider re-
voking its alcohol amnesty policy
and granting it to Pitt.

Eagle Ray

NBC Miami reports that a
3o0—pound spotted eagle ray
leapt out of the ocean and into a
charter boat in the Florida Keys
this week, landing on a tourist.
Though eagle rays are known to
feed on shrimp, crabs and other
crustaceans, we at The Pitt News
can never be sure when it comes
to identifying animals and their
diets. In addition to looking for
a Staff Ornitholo gist, we are now
accepting applications for the po-
sition of Staff Marine Biologist to
conﬁrm that this was in fact an
eagle ray and not a falcon ray.

According to a March 15 post
on Craigslist, a male student in an
infamous David Lawrence Hall
men’s bathroom is looking for
some lovin’. The post says that
he witnessed one man on his

other man, and the poster wants
in on the action. If you are the

leave this guy hanging dry — he
wants to know the color of your

A Letters to the editor

To the Editor,

Nick Stamatakis’ op-ed from March 30 is right to criticiie the “pay-as-you-go” Social Security system, but
he’s wrong in his reasoning. The idea of a Social Security trust fund is not a bad idea because it engenders
higher government deﬁcits; it’s a bad idea because savings at the national level are ultimately illusory. Caring

, for today’s retiring Boomers requires today’s labor, not money saved up from years ago. The government,

as sovereign issuer of currency, can always print more money to meet its ﬁnancial obligations. High FICA
taxes have only served to rob wealth fromthe private sector by decreasing the take—home income of workers
for the past several decades.

To the Editor, ‘ V ‘

I would like to address the issue of women’s “sex toys,” as discussed by Leah Trimble iniher article on
March 31, “Give women’s orgasms the respect they deserve.”

There are so many cases around the world of women being abused in the sexual sphere — from inap-

propriate sexual epithets to physical abuse to rape. The threats of these deplorable acts toward women are

‘ prevalent around the world — even in our own country do we see these abuses taking place. Women are

looked upon as objects of pleasure. As things to be thrown aside when someone’s done with them. As things

to be used. All of these acts and attitudes are injustices which must be fought against. ’

But I don’t see how women using sex toys is going to do anything but perpetuate the abuses and injustices
against them. Why? It will only cause them to look at men as objects of pleasure, as well. Things to be thrown
aside when they’re done with them. Things to be used. Because if a woman is using sex toys, mere objects,

to “have ﬁin,” then what’s preventing her from using a man, a fellow human being, just for fun as well? And '

Think We’re craz ?
Send a letter to t e
  editor.
letters@pittneWs.com

if a woman is using a man, what’s preventing him from using her in the same way?
Women’s use of sex toys does not “celebrate women.” It is not liberating to women, but binding e it
binds them in a perpetual cycle of hedonism and objectiﬁcation in which women and men will only suffer

all the more. A

Off—campus Iivingneed not

pump stress into your life

Katie McLaughlin
Contributing Editor

Moving out of the dorms is a big
step toward adulthood that many
students dream of, but few fully
appreciate the responsibilities off-
campus life entails. From monthly
rent and utilities to food, parking,
textbooks and entertainment, liv-
ing on your own can be expensive
-— especially in Oakland, where
the rent is high but the quality of
housing is generally low. Now that
you’ve signed a lease and commit-
ted to a residence for the year, plan
strategically to ensure a stress—free
off—campus lifestyle.

_First, drawup a contract with

your future roommates. Don’t wor-
ry. This isn’t a prenup and doesn’t
doom you and your BFF’s relation-
ship to fail. It will simply protect you
should your roommate stop paying
rent, begin partying every evening,
eat all of your food or fail to wash
the dishes ever. Done correctly, a
written roommate contract will
generally stand up in court if you
ﬁnd yourselfin the position of col-
lecting 10 month’s back-rent from
your ex—friend. .

Once you’re legally covered,
consider how you’re going to pay

your rent. (Hopefully you thought‘

about this a bit before you signed
that lease.) If you work enough dur-
ing the summer and the pay is good,
you won’t need a job during the fall
or spring semesters. You can also

use Stafford Loans to pay for rent. I 7

don’t recommend using other loans
or credit cards, though — the astro-

Hip—Hop awards aim to unite local musicians

It was in Atlanta, at the ﬁrst BET
Hip—Hop Awards in 2006, that
Dwayne Muhammad got the idea to
host a hip-hop awards show in his
hometown of Pittsburgh.

With the Steel City show, Muham-
mad, the national concert promoter
for 360 Entertainment, wanted both

to recognize local artists and local
businesses and bridge the gap be-
tween local hip—hop pioneers and
those aspiring to a career in the in-
dustry.

Four awards shows later, Muham-
mad said he has seen not only a pro-
gressive bridging of the gap between
veteran and rookie artists, but also a
collaboration of efforts on alocal and

national level. The ﬁfth armual Pitts— '

burgh Hip—Hop Awards willkick off at
the August Wilson Center with a red
carpet ceremony at 6 pm. Sunday,
followed by the commencement of
the awards show at 7pm. -
Prior to the ﬁrst PHHA, a lot of
artists weren’t collaboratingwith oth-
er artists, Muhammad said. Whether
it was a lack of interest in joint proj-
ects or just afear of the unknown, he
thinks the inaugural PHHA helped to

change that mindset.

“I wanted ‘everybody to come
together and recognize who’s doing
what and feed off of each other,” Mu-
hammad said.

Since putting on the ﬁrst PHHA,
Muhammad has expanded his efforts
to Harrisburg, Pa., Philadelphia, Or-
lando, Fla., and Tampa Bay, Fla.

The encouragement to do so came
from hip-hop pioneer and Rock and
Roll Hall of Fame inductee Grand-
master Melle Mel, who served as co-
host of the ﬁrst awards show.

“It was at the ﬁrst PHHA that
Melle Mel told me that this was a big
step for hip-hop. He told me I should
take it all over the country,” Muham-
mad said. ,

With the PHHA in its ﬁfth year,
Muhammad also has the cities of Mi-
ami, Houston, Dallas, Los Angeles

and Oakland, Calif., onboard to host
their own hip-hop awards shows.

A few PHHA nominees and win-
ners have come to be well—known in
their respective categories, including
Wiz Khalifa— who at the ﬁrst PHHA
won “Best Male Artist” and “Lyri-
cist of the Year” — and Mac Miller,
who won “Best 21 and Under Artist”
and “Video of the Year” at last year’s
PHHA and was recently named XXL
Magazine’s 2011 Freshman.

One local producer, Mysterious, is
tryingto make the most out ofhis two
“Producer of the Year” awards.

Mysterious, 28, said that he’s
been producing for about 15 years,
and since winning a PHHA, he has
seen a rise in recognition. Before the
PHHA, Mysterious characterized his
careeras “just grinding and tryingto
make it.” He was constantly attempt-

ing to get more people to listen to his
beats and sell them to other produc-
ers, artists and whoever else could
help him gain repute.

“Since Iwon my ﬁrst award, there
has deﬁnitely been more volume as
far as people interested in listening to
and buying my beats and collaborat-
ing with me,” Mysterious said. i

. Accordingly, Mysterious said
he valued the PHHA’s networking

. opportunities over the competitive

aspects.

“For me, the networking is maybe
the top reason to go,” Mysterious said.
“Seeing who wins comes second to
thenetworking and promotion op-
portunities.”

, He added that the awards show
also gets the fans involved, because

of eight to 10 people from around the city. This
includes, but is not limited to, music artists,

who did the most that year in each category,”

35 categories to choose from, encompassing art

“Barbershop of the Year” and “Facebook User . '

Young stars help UFC gain popularity

Donnie Tasser
Staff Writer

 

With a knee to the head, it was
over.

Last week at UFC 128 — a
mixed martial arts event held
by the Ultimate Fighting Cham-
pionship — Jon “Bones” Jones
laid a savage beating on Brazil-
ian Mauricio “Shogun” Rua, the
highly touted light-heavyweight
champion of the UFC, to become
the youngest title belt—holder
in the organization’s' history at
23.

Jones is the most hyped ﬁght-
er to come into the UFC since
B.J. Penn almost 10 years ago,
and he has certainly lived up to
the hype, registering the techni-
cal knockout at 2:37 of the third
round. “

Rua was dominated in his
first title defense.Jones opened
up fast, controlled the pace and
landed 87 strikes to Rua’s 13,

MCT Campus.

mixed martial arts match in Las Vegas.

according to Compustrike, a
source for mixed martial arts
statistics.

In the third round, all Jones
needed was a body shot followed
by a knee to the head to fell the
champion beforethe referee
quickly ordered the stoppage.

Jones’s ﬁrst title defense will
come against close friend and
training partner, former light-
heavyweight champion Rashad
Evans. , -

Whether you like the UFC or
think that it is a violent, testos-
terone-fueled bloodbath, you
cannot argue with its popular-
ity. -

In 2006, the UFC broke the
pay-per-view record, generat-
ing almost $223 million in rev-
enue, and the ﬁgure continues
to climb. Mixed martial arts is
the fastest growing sport in the
country, and it gives athletes in
smaller participation sports -

like wrestling and judo — a pro- .

fessional outlet that they never

had before. -

The UFC is ﬁlled with up-and-
coming young fighters like Jones
and Phil “Mr. Wonderful” Davis,
a former Penn State wrestling
national champion who defeated
another highly ranked ﬁghter,
Antonio Rogério Nogueira, by
unanimous decision at UFC
Fight Night 24 last month.

Davis provides his fair share
of entertainment beyond the
physical ﬁght. When ﬁghters
jaw outside the ring, it gives the
ﬁghts more fuel —— and a WWE-
esque aura in the Octagon, albeit
without the trashy acting and
cheesy lines. ‘ »

The veteran superstars, like
current welterweight (heavier

Gibbs officially
declares for draft

Lauren Kirschman
Assistant Sports Editor

Ashton Gibbs ofﬁcially declared
for the NBA draft on Thursday by
submitting his early—entry paper-
work to the league.

Because he didn’t hire an
agent, the junior guard can with-
draw his name from the draft un-

_ til May 8 at 5 p.m. and return for
his ﬁnal season at Pitt.

Pitt head coach Jamie Dixon
said that Gibbs, Pitt’s leading
scorer, wants to explore his draft
stock.

“Ashton wants to see where
he stands with NBA draft pos-
sibilities,” Dixon said in a news
release. “Ashton and I have had
numerous discussions dating
back to last year. Anytime you’re
an All-Big East First Team player,
it is something we encourage our

players to look into.”

He added that the team sup-
ports Gibbs’ goals and that the
guard is finishing up his gradu-
ation requirements.

Gibbs led the Panthers with
16.8 points per game this season.
He hit 46 percent of his shots
from the ﬁeld while knocking
down 49 percent of his 3-point-
ers. ‘ ' «-

One of the nation’s best shoot-
ers from beyond the arc, Gibbs
finished first in Big East 3-point
ﬁeld goal percentage and 3-point
field goals made per game. He
was an AP All-American honor-
able mention selection.

In 2008, former Pitt star Sam
Young tested the NBA waters be-
fore returning to school for his
senior season. This year, NBA
teams can pay for players’ travel
expenses, giving underclassmenf‘

‘ extra incentive to consider enter-

ing the draft. I

Gibbs’ decision to declare a good one

Whatever his decision, Gibbs will beneﬁt from testing draft waters.

"5
Alex Oltmanns
Sports Editor

 

When I ﬁrst heard the news that Pitt guard
gAshton Gibbs was declaring for]une’s NBA
Draft, I have to admit I was surprised.

It never really occurred to me that Gibbs
would consider leaving school a year early
after not really popping up on many NBA
mock draft boards.

But now that I’ve had a couple days to
consider it, the decision to enter the draft
without hiring an agent — making him
eligible to return to Pitt next year — is
actually a great idea.

Gibbs, who led the Panthers in scoring
this past season with 16.8 points per game,

.,._.__will now get a chance over the next couple

weeks to test the draft waters by working
out for teams with other NBA prospects.

No matter how the workouts turn out for
Gibbs, he’s in a win-win situation.

If he performs well, his draft stock will
rise and he will probably opt to remain
in the draft with an increased draft posi-
tion.

And if he struggles in the workouts, he
will get plenty of feedback from NBA scouts
on what to work on for next year’s draft,
should he choose to return to Pitt for his

senior season.

Gibbs will surely be one of the best
shooters in any workout he is in — if not
the best —— but teams will be closely eval-
uating his other skills, such as creating
his own shot offensively and his defensive
abilities.

draft prospects’ travel expenses for their
workouts. In years past, the players have
paid their own ways.

Gibbs has yet to hire an agent, which
still gives him the option to return to
school. Hiring an agent locks players into
the draft.

Gibbs will surely be one of the
best shooters in any Workout he
is in — if not the best...  

The N ewjersey native has all the skills
necessary to impress scouts, and all it takes
is the ability to stand out in one team’s mind
to be considered for the draft.

Whether it be a team that’s looking for
a deadeye shooter, like the Miami Heat, or
a team looking to groom a point guard for
the future, of which there are plenty, the
opportunities are bountiful for Gibbs.

Even more enticing is the fact that this is
the ﬁrst year when NBA teams can pay for

And if I had to guess what Gibbs will de-
cide, I would wager that he puts the entire
NBA draft process on hold for one more
year to reﬁne his craft in college for another
season and looks to lead the Panthers to
the ever-elusive Final Four.

Yet there should be no doubting Gibbs’
decision to test his NBA stock over the next
two weeks. If the draft system is made to
be tested by underclassmen, players might
as well test it. I

UFC(15

outside the ring.

The unexpected personality of ﬁght-
ers, shown when St-Pierre and Josh Ko-
scheck fought at UFC 124, will only add
to the popularity of the sport.

Koscheck, a Waynesburg, Pa., native,
did his best Chad Ochocinco imperson-
ation and ran his mouth from the second
he won a chance at St-Pierre’s belt.

He trashed everything from the fighter
himself to his hometown team, the Mon-
treal Canadiens. Even though St"-Pierre,
clearly a better fighter, laid waste to
Koscheck in theoctagon, the constant
j awing of Koscheck led to a healthy gate
receipt and an all-time UFC live atten-
dance record.

With the acquisition of the World Ex-
treme Cagefighting — a smaller mixed
martial arts organization — and the
promise of more ﬁghts on cable, it does
not look like the ,UFC’s popularity will
waver, especially if the sport keeps churn-
ing out young superstars like “Bones” and
“Mr. Wonderful.” I
