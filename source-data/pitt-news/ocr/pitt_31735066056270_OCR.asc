Increase in crime,

Violent on-campus crime has increased while

‘the'number of university police officers and

guards has decreased since the relatively safe mid-
’80s. .
The most striking crime increase was aggravated

Brennan also said that the decline in staff has
been halted at 62 officers and supervisors and 17
guards since the ‘92 appointment of Assistant Vice
Chancellor of Business and Finance John DeVitto,
who oversees Public Safety among other depart-
merits.
“lDeVittol has just done a tremendous job,”
Brennan said.
Nonetheless, violent crime has risen fairly steadi-
ly since the lows in ‘87 and ‘88, mirroring a city-
wide increase in crime. Aggravated assaults and

The department lost 10 officers and supervisors
and 10 guards from ‘89 to ‘91. According to Public
Safety Director William Brennan, the cuts were not
made all at once, but were the result of budget
decisions to not replace personnel who were
moving on.

The department coped with the cuts by attempt-
ing to deploy its officers as efficiently as possible,
Brennan said.

“Obviously [with fewer officersl Your ability to
do the same job is affected,” Brennan said, adding
that many police forces are down—sizing. “But
that’s the name of the game, you have to use your
people most effectively.”

Unlike the assaults, most of the rapes and sexual
assaults reported were committed by a person
known to the victim. Several occurred in the vic-
tim’s room.

Because many rapes go unreported, it is difficult
to attribute the increase in rape reports to an actu-
al rise in rapes, Brennan said.

The number of robberies, the forceful taking of
anything of value, have been variable since ‘85 but
peaked at 26 last year. These ranged from non-
violent incidents, such as when a woman grabbed

to an incident in which two males choked a

BiGALA restructured
to be support group

By Thanita Adams
For The Pitt News

This semester, the Bisexual
Gay and Lesbian Alliance has
been restructured as a sup-
port group, setting aside the
politically active thrust it has
been known for in the past.

The group is adjusting its
theme to meet the current
needs of its members, co-
President Stacy Winters said.
Meetings and events will
focus on social and emotion-
al issues, rather than activist
issues.

Winters said she is pleased
to see BiGALA’s change in
emphasis. She said that the
traditional activism of the
group “has left out a whole

" other population that just did

not want the pressure. This is
the first time that I have seen
itact as a collective.”
BiGALA has a full schedule
planned, with activities at

Toward the end of

with Campus Women’s

Organization, will sponsor an
AIDS awareness booth in the
William Pitt Union
Concourse. Winters said that
they want to educate every-
one on campus about the
virus.

“This is not a gay disease,
it’s everyone’s problem. AIDS
is a problem on campuses
across the United States. But,
no other student organization
here has done anything
about it,” Winters said.

Following the AIDS aware-
ness booth, BiGALA will run
a Safer Sex Workshop. The
Aids Task Force will speak at

Theme parks are
looking for you

By Katie Kaminski
Staff‘ Writer

Theme park audition
teams are coming to cam-
pus, and they’re looking for
you.

Around this time each
year, teams of theme park
auditioners and park repre-
sentatives tour the nations’
college campuses searching
for talented students to fill a
variety of positions including
dancers, singers, instrumen-
talists, magicians, comedians
and costumed characters.

Although parks generally
employ anyone over 16
years old, college students
make up a large portion of
many theme park payrolls.
For example, of the 4,500
employees at Kings Island a
“huge part” are college stu-
dents, said Terry Brinkman,

employment supervisor for
the Cincinnati, Ohio, theme
park.

Theme park stages are the
ideal place for performers to
display their talents while
polishing their skills, accord-
ing to park representatives.

“A lot of our singers have
gone on to perform on
cruise ships, and they’ve
even gone to New York to
Radio City Music Hall,”
Brinkman said.

Theme parks are a great
place for aspiring performers
to begin. Brinkman also said
that many performers get
their first experiences in
entertaining live audiences
on theme park stages.

Not everyone is suited for
these jobs, however. Parks
have very specific qualities
they look for in applicants.

President pro tempore
Schroeder said the board’s
vote was, in a way,
insignificant, because the
weekend would be paid
for anyway.

“The money is going to
come from the Student
Activities fee regardless,”
he said.

Waslo agreed that
the voting on the final
bills at that point was
irrelevant because admin-
istration had already
decided to foot the bill
with activities fees either
way.

She also pointed out that
the current board, with
the exception of Brody,
had no input or knowl-

edge of the weekend
retreat’s location or price
tag.

“You can’t ask
these members, who
knew nothing about this
retreat, to reach into their
own pockets,” Waslo
added.

Grassia said he voted for
allocations decision
because, “Morally I find it
incomprehensible to
spend such an amount 
before or after the fact.”

Moody, business manag-
er for this year’s
board, said that on this
issue, part of the responsi-
bility of the board was to
“alleviate any and all
debts. .

“I’m not supporting any

deficit, and I’m not
supporting any one per-
son,” Moody said.

“However, this is just a
matter of procedure and it
shouldn’t be blown out of
proportion.”

Schroeder defended
Brody’s decision regarding
the retreat. “People
are quick "to judge
when they think someone
has made a mistake, but
they never take time to
look at the positive things
they’ve done before,” he
said.

Brody said he did not
think the integrity of the
SGB had been ruined.

“I do believe it’s time to
put behind us our mis-
takes,” he said.

When auditioning for perfor-
mance positions, theme parks
want talented and versatile indi-
viduals who can easily adapt to
the wide variety of shows pro-
duced in the park ranging from
Top 40 to Country and
Broadway to Mo-Town.

“We are searching for energy
that shines with professionalism
and versatility,” said Marjc
Cronenwett, park attractions
manager at Cedar Point in
Sandusky, Ohio. “\We’re also
looking for performers who can
put their heart and soul into
each and every performance.”

Other positions, such as cleri-
cal and marketing jobs, are also
available in these parks. These
positions require excellent com-
munication and people skills.
Experience is always helpful
but is not required by all parks.

Many of the major theme
parks pay competitive salaries,
and most offer reduced housing
to those employees who live
outside of the park area. Other
benefits include free access to
parks on days off and discounts
ranging from 25 to 40 percent
on park merchandise.

If you are considering apply-
ing to a park for any position,
check for the dates and times of
on-campus auditions.
Performers should prepare at
least two selections of contrast-
ing styles. All applicants should
also bring a resume and pre-
pare for a brief interview. If you
miss the on-campus auditions,
some parks will accept a video-
taped audition.

To find out more about avail-
able theme park positions and
how to apply, call the park’s
attractions office. '

Let them eat lobster

It is one of the most famous lines ever spoken. Admonishing
in the wealth and prestige of her position, “Let them eat cake,”
said Marie Antoinette to her French peasants. The rest of the
story is history. Antoinette had her head chopped off, and the
peasants revolted. France was to never have a monarchy again.

Turning the pages of the calendar forward to Jan. 25, 1992;
Student Government Board President Jacob Brody and his
trusty sidekick Ted Schroeder echoed these sentiments. In
comparison to Antoinette, only the means by which Brody

, assumed power was different, and the phrasing of the state-

ment slightly less definitive. “Can’t we just put it behind us?”
asked Schroeder, referring to the infamous SGB retreat in
Nemacolin Woodlands. Calling for Brody’s head is still a bit
premature. But the restraint is shaky and a revolution surely
awaits.

But for now, political turmoil lurks and President Brody has
yet to answer many of the questions surrounding the trip. Such
as how are students going to be reimbursed for the reckless
spending of their money, money that wasn’t allocated in the
first place?

Well there is one more question for him to ponder. Is it pos-
sible to put something behind you, when it has not even been
placed in front? Last night at the SGB meeting, SGB President
Jacob Brody and members of the board met attempted to put
the $9,000 retreat behind them. It seems they only re—ignited
the flame.

The voting blocks were very telling. There were four mem-
bers who voted for the allocation of the funds, two who voted
against it and two who abstained. Anthony Moody expressed
his support of it by explaining that it wasn’t a moral issue and
Schroeder added that since the money was already spent it
was time to move on. To welp on board members may not be
fair since they didn‘t vote on the retreat. However, it is impor-
tant to note that by voting in favor of the funding, they are
granting legitimacy to Brody’s actions.

Given these situations, why didn’t they vote to deny the
funding if it didn’t matter anyway? Clearly, students are out-
raged, and if it isn’t a moral issue then what is it? Perhaps we
should have let Richard Nixon serve out his second term in the
White House. Who cares that he stole the tapes? We sho_uld
have probably just put that behind us as well.

Brody has met with a barrage of criticism surrounding the
trip. It was unnecessary and excessive. Not only that, but he
also spent money that was not allocated to him. Perhaps worse
than the trip itself is the fact that Brody has failed to explain
himself to the student community at large. Two weeks ago
Brody was phoned by The Pitt News and was offered the
chance to explain his rationale behind the trip. The offer still
stands and we hope Brody will take this opportunity and
explain himself to the constituents.

This afternoon, beginning at 3 p.m. in the ballroom of the
William Pitt Union, Brody, the SGB members and members of
the administration will meet to discuss your concerns as stu-
dents. We urge not only a few people to attend this meeting,
but everybody. Outlets such as The Pitt News and open forums
are essential to holding those in power accountable. As long as

Undergrad degree needed to ﬂip burgers

Clinton’s made a thousand
promises. How many he will actu-
ally keep is questionable, and
nobody really expects him to keep
them all anyway. But one of his
campaign promises is particularly
disturbing and, curiously, has
become the one with the most
common support. Clinton promises
that when he is president, everyone
will have the opportunity to go to
college.

Why is this bad? A college
degree has become a symbol of
achievement in oru‘ country and is
ahnost indispensable if your sights
are set higher than a burger ﬂip-

per’slotinlife.

But hasn’t \\\\\\\\\\\'\\\\\‘
enough already 
been done to 

//r/I

undermine the
value of a bach-
elor’s degree?
Over the years,
a liberal arts
education has
become more
and more
worthless. Why
is this? There are
many reasons
— two of the
most important
being the over-
w h e 1 m i n g
amount of col-
lege graduates
today and the
sanitization, or
“political cor-
rect”—ing, of the f
college curricu-

lum. Your professors and organiza-
tions like the Modern Language
Association can take credit for this
mishap.

Not so long ago a person went
to college to learn. College degrees
were the exception rather than the
norm, and an employer knew that
the college graduate he hired
would be trained in the area of
study which his work would
require.

Not so anymore. Gradually, little
bits of society slipped into the col-
lege community and produced
some horrendous offspring. What
about Community Colleges?

Originally these schools were
intended to get slower students
ready for a competitive college.
Now a student can graduate from
these schools with a degree that is
worth little more than the paper it
is printed on.

Yet this is supposed to be an
educational aspiration, a goal, to
create colleges which are accessible
by anyone. College used to be
about education. Now it’s about
multiculturalism and providing a

subject to rug bum.

So what will be the end result of
a Clintonian society of college grad-
uates? College will no longer be the
proving grounds. Instead, at a time
when few people will be able to
afford undergraduate schooling,
people will be forced to continue
their education at ridiculous
expense.

What does this all mean? Just
this: Nothing will change except
that the average menial laborer will
start working four years later than
he would have before due to the
four lost years he spent in college.

The solution to the problems in
our country today is not to send
our people on a wild
goose chase after
some symbolic
sheepskin but to
teach people to be
proud of their work.
Our country has
thrived on the philos-
ophy that anyone

pleasant environment for anyone
who happens to deviate from nor-
mality. There is a place for this type

of activity, but the college campus ,

is not it.

It’s time we take a realistic look
at the state of higher education in
our country. At a time when the
value of a college education is
going down faster than the value of
the ruble, Bill Clinton wants to go
all the way and turn this country’s
colleges into 13th through 16th
grade schools where the adminis-
trations will have to bend over so
far backwards to make dullards feel
at home that their noses will he

along the line that
idea got perverted to
“everyone must try to
be a rocket scientist.”
So people are
ashamed of their low
skill jobs rather than
proud. He’s not
going to like it much,
yet these people pro-
vided vital services to
the community and
they should not be ashamed of
what they do.

In economically successful soci-
eties, people are taught to excel,
but the fact is recognized that not
everyone can benefit from higher
education. Yet, their career is just as
important as anyone else’s. Their
society accepts them and they are
proud. Perhaps our skewed out-
look will forbid us from this realistic
solution. I’m just glad I’ll be out of
college before Clinton’s masses
make my degree completely null
and void. Good luck to all future
students, but don’t say I didn't let
you know!

William 8: Mary edges
Pitt men's gymnastics

By Jeremy Swarbrick
Staff Writer

It was déja vu for Pitt this
past weekend as the men’s
gymnastics team again fin-
ished a close second to
William & Mary College. last
Saturday, as it visited a tour-
nament hosted by the Tribe.

Two weeks ago, the
Panthers dropped their first
tournament by a mere three
points at the hands of the
Tribe. The story was much
the same this time around.
William & Mary edged out
Pitt by a score of 249.4() to
247.15, dropping the
Panthers record to 5-2 on the
season. Miami rounded out
the meet, finishing a distant
third with a score of 129.25.

The Panthers’ top perfor-
mance was once again
turned in by their senior
captain, Genaro Severino,
who won the all—around

event for the second time in
two meets, this time with a
score of 54.00. Severino also
placed in five out of the six
individual events in which
he has competed.

On the floor exercises, the
Panthers turned in a very
solid performance, scoring a
team total of 43.00 points.
Severino took second place
honors with a score of 9.10.
Also turning in high scores
for Pitt were Jason Lannie
(8.75) and Mike Maurer
(8.60).

The Panthers’ strong show-
ing on the floor was over-
shadowed by their perfor-
mance on the pommel horse.
Although sophomore Jon
Shapiro, who has been the
Panthers most consistent
performer on this apparatus,
earned a third—place finish
with a score of 8.40, the rest
of the team faltered a bit and

Women 3 gymnastics places
third at William 6 Mary

By Todd S. Rimer
For the Pitt News

The good news for the Pitt
women’s gymnastics team this
past weekend was that it
incurred no more injuries and
a few individual career highs
were attained. The bad news
was that Pitt did not win the
meet.

The Panthers travelled to
William & Mary University,
where they finished third out
of a field of four. The
University of North Carolina

finished first with ascore of-

185.55, the host team finished
a close second with 184.9
points, Pitt finished third with
a score of 179.85 and Miami
University at Ohio finished a
distant fourth with a" score of
167.60.

The third place finish cannot

Hockey club counts onCrousey

Count it.

Anybody who has followed
the Pitt Hockey Club and has
seen number 27 Bill Crousey in

one that pops into your mind
whenever Crousey touches the
puck. ,

value. The Panthers improved
on their team scores from last
week on all events but beam.
Had they performed to their
ability on beam they would
have had a good chance at
winning the meet or at least
placing second.

The Panthers began the
meet on vault, earning a score
of 45.20. Some quality scores
were provided by Karen
Jorgensen (8.8), Christine
Battista (9.05) and a season
high for Mikie Meyers (8.85).
Kristen Brown finished in a tie
for second with a 9.2, and
Alisha Friend was the number
one competitor on this event
with a score -of 9.30..

passer and goal scorer, has been
on a season-long tear. The num-
bers speak for themselves.

Through 13 games this season,
he has scored 22 goals and

Powlus ponders Pitt
The cornerstone may soon be in place, _ I I ._
A report in yesterday_’s Pittsburgh Post-Gazette said that quar-

terback Ron Powlus, -the top prep player in the country, will

announce his choice of schools Saturday at a press conference,
and it could very well by Pitt.

George Curry, who coached Powlus
at Berwick High School, said that Pitt has “an
outstanding chance” of getting the young
quarterback.

Curry pointed to new Pitt passing
_ coordinator Ken Karcher and the wide open
offense he intends to implement with the Panthers as a reason
Powlus may come to Pittsburgh.

The report goes on to say that Pitt head coach johnny Majors
intends to use Powlus as the cornerstone of his program, as he
did with Tony Dorsett during his first tenure running the Panther
program.

Pitt got some help in protecting whoever it has at quarterback

scores this season.

It’s hard to believe that
Crousey, a senior criminal justice

NCAA Division II Mercyhurst
College, where he played before
transferring to Pitt.

hockey.”

Pitt was perfect for Crousey, a
graduate of nearby Steel Valley
High School. He had no trouble
making the team here and has
been the driving force behind
the Panther offense ever since
his an‘ival.

Despite the imposing presence
of Crousey on the ice, the
Panthers have had a tough sea-
son so far. They have an overall
record of 4-8-1, including a 2-5-1
mark in the WPCHA. The prob-
lem earlier in the season was
defense — the Panthers surren-
dered an average of nearly seven
goals over the first 10 games.
Since then, however, the defense
has improved slightly, as demon-
strated in two impressive week-
end performances against the
top two teams in the league,
West Virginia University and
Indiana University of
Pennsylvania.

The Panthers played well
under rough conditions in
Morgantown, despite losing to
the Mountaineers 6-5 on
Saturday. They returned home
and battled the best team in the
league, IUP, to a 5-5 tie on
Sunday.

“It’s always tough to play at
WVU, because their fans really

get into the game,” Crousey said.
“I think our defense played well
under the circumstances  we
picked up a lot of new guys
over the break  I think they
will definitely help the team.”

The Panthers have five games
left on the schedule (Duquesne,
Slippery Rock, CMU, WVU, Penn
State-West), and after that, Bill
Crousey’s hockey career at Pitt
will be over. What lies ahead
could be a job in criminal justice.
It could also be a career in pro-
fessional hockey, possibly in the
East Coast Hockey League,
which is just three steps from the
NHL.

“I know a lot of guys that are
playing in the ECHL.  l’1l prob-
ably tiy out for the johnstown
Chiefs [a minor league team in
the Boston Bruins’ organization]
if I don’t find a job [in criminal
justicel.”

Crousey and the Panthers will
have revenge on their minds this
Friday as they take the ice in a
rematch against Duquesne to be
played in the Pittsburgh Civic
Arena at 7:30. The Dukes embar-
rassed Pitt 10-3 in their last meet-
ing on Nov. 22.

“Duquesne is always a big
game  very physical  it’s a
lot of fun because the fans are
always a big factor.”

two events.

Things would get worse
for the Panthe.rs before they
got better. On the still rings,
Pitt continued to slide, earn-
ing a team total of 59.60.
Despite the poor score,
Severino earned himself a
first—place finish, tallying a
9.30. Keith Youndt garnered
a third-place finish with an
8.90.

two previous events had
slipped as well. Severino
again took top honors with a
score of 9.30 and Lannie

two punch by taking second

In the meets final two
events, Severino continued
his domination, grabbing
two more first—place finishes
on both the parallel bars
(9.05) and on the high bar.

Pitt’s Karl Chan also com-
pleted a very strong routine
on the bar, which earned

Brown was the second best
competitor, earning a 9.60.
The other top performers
were Shannon Brown (8.9),
Bethany Toellner (8.7) and
Friend (8.75). b

At this juncture Pitt was
only half a point out of first
place. Then, surprisingly,
everything virtually fell apart
for the Panthers on beam.
Eight falls were recorded,
accounting for four points
being lost.

“This event definitely hurt
us  it was very bad,” Pitt
Coach Debbie Yohman said.

The Panthers earned 42.45
points, down 3.1 points from
last week. The scores were
provided by jorgensen
(7.95), Friend (8.35). Brown

(8.45) and Deena Daller
(8.55).

"Deenas score was impres-
sive  She did very well
despite not being able to
tumble all week because of a
slight injury,” Yohman said.

The career—high score of
9.15 by Myers was the only
bright spot on beam for Pitt.

“Everyone but Mikie had
problems on beam,” said
Yohman.

Meyers averaged 9.15 on
the three events in which she
competed, achieving the best
meet of her young career.
This is quite an achievement
considering Meyers is not yet
working to her potential. She
is simply doing a great job
within her limits.

The Panthers finished the

meet on a positive swing,
earning 46.7 points on floor,
their strongest event of the
day.

jorgensen tied for third
with a score of 9.6 and
Brown was the number one
competitor on this event,
scoring a 9.70. This score
was good enough to tie her
career high and place her
fifth on the top 1() list in Pitt
history. Battista (8.6),
Toellner (9.55) and Friend
(9.45) also had solid perfor-
mances.

“The mood following the
meet was somber,“ Yohman
said. They had a look of dis-
belief, Yohman said, because
they had done so well on
beam in practice. Doing as
bad as they did in competi-

tion simply shocked them.

“Individually, there were
many excellent things to
applaud,” Yohman said.

Yohman said that the over-
all score concerns her
because of the poor perfor-
mance on beam. The mis-
takes can be corrected, but
this week the Panthers need
to work on beam.

“The girls need to concen-
trate on beam and on how
well they are capable of per-
forming on this event rather
than focussing on the distrac-
tions.” Yohman said. “This
team has too much talent to
let what happened on beam
happen again  They will
bounce back next week
because they are simply that
good.“

ward Chris McNeal said. “He
creates things by being at the
right place at the right time.”

As of late, Brush has been a
catalyst for the Panthers, and
that was especially true in Pitt’s
81-70 win at Boston College last
week.

Down 28-15 in the first half,
Brush came off the bench to
score a career—high 11 points
and nine rebounds and lead the
Panthers to their third straight
Big East victory.

“When I come into the game I
try to play good defense,” Brush
said after the BC victory. “I try
to give the team a little spark
and let things go from there.”

Saturday, Brush pulled down
eight rebounds and scored five
points in Pitt’s 86-84 victory
over Miami.

Brush is very modest about
his accomplishments on the
court.

He said that it is the nature of
this year’s team for everyone to
be involved in victories.

“Between the players, you

never know whose turn it is to
come out and play real well,”
Brush said. “It’s different people
coming in and being big keys in
the game.”

Despite how much his play
has improved on the court,
Brush says he is

out of high school in 1989,
Brush did have the opportunity
to sign early with a smaller col-
lege, but instead he held out
with the hope that Bucknell
University would offer him a
scholarship.

worked out any better for the
senior, who said he is excited
about how well things are going
this year.

“It’s a pleasant surprise,”
Brush said. “I’m really happy
my senior year is going like
this.”

With Pitt in first

 
   

 

will slump.

H o w e V e r ,
Brush said he
feels this is
a different team
from those that
m a y h a v e
faltered before.
5 8 “This season

overlooked his hard work nor
his importance to the basketball
team. This past season, Evans
rewarded Brush with an athletic
scholarship.

Brush took an unchartered
canal en route to Pitt. Coming

“I wanted to go to Bucknell,
but that didn’t work out,” Brush
said. “But after finding out that
Pitt had five players ineligible, I
called up Coach Evans and he
told me to come try out.”

Things could not have

there is a lot less individualism
and more team play,” Brush
said. “We got a taste of where
we’re at, and everybody thinks
that we can win the Big East.
“In the past people talk about
Pitt being 10-4 and then they

had a let down,” Brush said. “I
don’t think we’re going to have
a let down, everybody on the
team knows their roles.”

This Wednesday, the Syracuse
Orangemen come to town to
try to halt Pitt’s four game
winning streak and knock them
out of first place in the confer-
ence.

“We don’t feel any pressure,”
Brush said. “We’re going out
and playing one game at a time
and it’s going real well.”

One difference that Brush
attributes to Pitt’s success this
season is Evans’ ability to get
his team up for the big games.

“In the four years I have been
here, this is the best job the
coach has done motivating,”
Brush said. “He knows all the
right buttons to push.”

Whatever Brush feels the
reasons are for Pitt’s success, it

is evident that someone is doing

something right.

But one thing for sure is that
Brush can’t seem to do wrong
of late and it is showing in his
team's record.
