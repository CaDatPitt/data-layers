No End - - Of Cokes

Coke statistics show that engi-

more than 5,000 cokes in the last
six weeks, according to Paul Pa-
panek, ?41, president of Engineer-

Papanek reveals that the two
automatic coke machines installed
recently in State and Thaw halls
have netted the association $35
proﬁt so far.

Now that the boys are drinking,
they also want to smoke. Money
earned on the machines and pro-
ceeds from all association activities
go into a fund which will be used
to provide a lounge for engineers
who at present have no Tuck shop

‘Blossom Time’ Star Blushes
For Youthful   Journalists

. ‘By GEORGIA SHUSET

A high school sophomore-—lovely little thing—sat in one of - the.

Nixon's red plush seats Tuesday afternoon, and dilated her nostrils at

Everett Marshall. I

She,was one of a group of approximately 20 high school and college

reporters who -were invited by form
letter-to a mass interview at which

\ the star of “Blossom Time,” would

take on all comers.
We pseudo-journalists were wait-
ing for Marshall backstage, when

_  in the form of -“Coming

Through, the Rye” burst uncere-
moniously from one of the dressing-
rooms.

And out he walked!

Our hero!

The sophomore crossed her legs,
parted her lips, and gazed through
half-closed eyes at the singer.

The singer gazed back, and be-
came. slightly red in the face.

Heslowly looked the group over
—-three adolescent boys and seven-
teen breathless girls—and shifted
uncomfortably to the other foot.

After a few preliminary necessi-
ties, including an introduction to
Harry Brown: the theater’s man-
ager, and taking a picture of Mar-
shall in the center of 17 eager
smiles (the boys were reluctant
about having their pictures taken)
the former opera star suggested that
“well—-er, maybe we-—er, ought to
sit down in the theater and—er,
well, we might as well be comf’t’-
ble.”

After approximately an hour and

 a quarter of superstitions-hobbies-

ambitions. questions, and several
faux pas on the part of the youth-
ful interviewers, Mr. Marshall sug-
gested that “well—-er, maybe we-—

er, well, I've enjoyed this very
.. -wshs’ . A

And if he’s true to his promise,

the star visited the Cathedral: and A

Foster memorial yesterday after-
noon at 2 o’clock.

Nice fellow--if he’s true to his
promise.

ICG Delegation
Meets Monday

The University delegation to In-
tercollegiate Conference on Govern-
ment will hold its third meeting
Monday afternoon at 3:30 o’clock in
132 Cathedral, announces Sam Rod-
gers, chairman.

At the last session 40 delegates
participated in a legislative assem-
bly that discussed the outlawing of
the Communist party. After the
discussion, nine committee chair-
men were appointed to head the va-
rious groups that will comprise the
University delegation.

Those appointed to committee
chairmanships were: Val Foltz, C41,
agriculture; George Hanna, C44, ed-
ucation; Holbert Carroll, C43, city
and county government organiza-
tion; Esther Marcuson, C41, labor
and industry; Don Parke, C41, nat-
ural resources; Rudy Janata, C41,
taxation and ﬁnance.

Others appointed were, Edward
Tablac, C43, public works; and Ed-

Award Tait, C42, state government

organization.

Latin America, and began to realize
that we had better strengthen those
relations for the sake of our own
self-defense!”

Miss Thralls was given her
chance to help strengthen those re-
lations not long ago when she,was
appointed a delegate to the third
general assembly of the Pan-Amer-
ican Institute of Geography and
History, which meets at Lima, Peru,
March 30 through April 8.

Chosen by the United States of-
ﬁce of education to participate in
the assembly, Miss Thralls was also
commissioned to act as a “goodwill
ambassador” of the University. She
sails from New York this afternoon
on the Santa Elena.

To Visit University

Miss Thralls told Pitt News r_e-
porters before she left, “Besides vis-
iting the schools and universities
of Latin America. I’m going to
make it a point to see as much, and
to learn as much about the people
themselves as I can possibly cram
into the two weeks that I’ll be in
South America.”

The geographer expressed her
conviction that the people of the
United States should learn more
about the arts, music, and literature
of South America saying, “Latin
Americans know far more about our
culture than we do about theirs;
and this inequality of cultural ap-
preciation will have to be remedied
before we can hope for some sort
of a more uniﬁed hemisphere.”
Accelerate Goodwill

“After all,” she said, “the fact
that Europe consumes most of
South America’s exports, coupled
with the fact that the Latin Ameri-
can nations are still closer culturally
to Europe than they are to the
United States, means that we had
better accelerate our goodwill ef-
forts in no small degree.”

Several suggestions were offered
by Miss Thralls for furthering
goodwill and cooperation between
the Americas, which she classiﬁed
into’ two main categories——cultural
trends, and economic policies.

As a cultural move, Miss Thralls
suggested that a more far-reaching
system of student-teacher exchanges
be instituted between the nations
of the hemisphere, for, as she
pointed out, “the process of mu-
tual understanding between North
and South America is fundamentally
an educational one.”

Praises Hull

Praising Cordell Hull’s reciprocal
trade policy, Miss Thralls declared
that its enlargement would mean
much in the establishment of better
relations between the northern and
southern parts of the hemisphere.

As a further economic measure,

Young asks that students desig-

Sales Efforts
This Afternoon

Copies of Yearbook
Top Former Number

Winding up a campaign which
featured you, cardboard owls, mir-
rors, yellow-tagged salesmen, and
potato chips, the 1941 Owl will close
its sales efforts for the year with a
salesmen’s meeting in the Owl of-
ﬁce at 2:30 o’clock today.

“The campaign deﬁnitely closes
today,” promises Hillard Kreimer,
BA42, circulation manager. “If,
however, someone wishes to buy an
Owl and does not have the neces-
sary money with him, he may re-
serve a copy with his salesman and
arrange for payments.”

Reports from the Owl ofﬁce indi-
cate that response to the sales cam-
paign has been excellent and sales
are expected to top last year’s ﬁg-
ures.

This year’s Owl will feature a
scrapbook effect with numerous
pages on which miscellaneous items
may be pasted.

The book sells for $3.50, but $1.50
can be paid when contact is made
and the balance before the book
comes out in May.

The actual date the Owl will
be released, however, is not known,
though editor William Sheris, BA41,
has stated that it will not come out
before May 9.

Charles Sarber, C42, organization
manager of the Owl, says that very
few campus organizations remain
unphotographed and those who do
not have a deﬁnite schedule should
immediately contact the Owl office
or see him on the eighth floor.

Tap Twigger, Radio Announcer

A life-long desire to do research
in the ﬁelds of endocrinology and
gynecologv which prompted a radio
announcer to return to school after
20 years, is now manifesting itself
in more concrete terms.

After one semester at the Uni-
versity, Norman Twigger, news ed-
itor for WCAE, and a freshman in
the College, was tapped to two hon-
orary fraternities at Scholars’ day
assembly Wednesday. Having a
2.8 quality point average, Twigger
was honored by Chi Rho Nu, hon-

   glues Than VVe Lost

, DR. H. CLIFFORD CARLSON is one of those
people of whom everyone says, “Go ahead and
razz him. He won’t mind.” This is absolutely
;true. Consequently, Dr. Carlson has been the
[butt of considerable good-natured ribbing.
; With his basketball teams compiling only
 records during the past three or four years,
the Doctor’s “Win ’em all” slogan became some-
fiwhat of a joke. His elimination offense, his ice-
,fcream-eating ballplayers, and his work as di-
rector of the University Student Health service
have all been singled out for caustic kidding.
Because the Doctor doesn’t get angry, the kid-
ders have come to feel that anything goes.

ketball season utilizing what Carlson called a
“Busy Bee” offense, the unique term presented

’ Dartmouth Liberals
And the War

We were reading a Dartmouth editorial the other
day. The editorial turned out to be a beautiful exam-
ple of what sometimes happens to liberals who, at
long last, ﬁnd some action in which they can partici-
pate physically, some movement which they can join
openly, some moral reform with which they can be in
conscientious accord. All this they can do and at
the same time let loose the energy they have hereto-
fore dammed up.

War is like that evidently. War solves for a time
certain personal problems which would normally have
to be solved by an inﬁnitely longer and harder process.

War is what the editorial is talking about.

Listen:

Safe in our classrooms and homes, ﬁfteen years
after the Armistice, our mental adolescence was
shaped by a second-hand World war. Snug and pro-
tected, we assimilated the horror of high explosive
and barbed wire. We borrowed a sophistication about
the chicanery which seduced another generation’s ideal-

ors and sophomores, Won 12 out of 17 games,
 averted three of the ﬁve losses, and last

nothing to make us look at war in terms of causes, we
developed a logic-proof conception of ﬁghting as an
evil for which there was no reason, and which could
always be avoided by simply looking the other way.

 ‘C0mmon Ground’ Tries
 Define an American

 

Common Ground, a Magazine

Several years ago a show called “Knickerbocker
Holiday” came to the Nixon. The audience sat through
lmost of it politely, but I think it was in the middle of

 the second act that someone sang its hit song, “That’s
._§..Vhat Makes An American” and encore after encore
It-‘was demanded. The theme of the song, if I recall cor-
 rectly, was that an American can always be distin-
 guished by his rugged individualism, particularly a

tendency to tell his boss to go to hell.

it UIt was all rather amusing, but_at the time I was

Louis 'Adamic (A-dam-ish), one of America’s bright

 young men and author of “Native’s Return” and “My
lVAmerica,” now offers such a deﬁnition.

Thas a sincere belief in what he’s doing (a rare enough
ljffhing these days). His enthusiasm is rather contagious
 now he’s started a magazine in order to reach a

larger audience. It’s called “Common Ground,” and

“instructive.

A Adamic, in a way, preaches the gospel of American-
 but he does it objectively and without an hys-

Vterical waving of banners. He discredits the “stickers

 He sees it, and justly I think, as only a su-

is in the hospital having his way-
ward appendix taken care of . . .

This cynical view of youth, even the whole editorial,
is an inspired attempt to break down opposition to war.
And in its analysis of why most American students do
not want war, it is quite false.

The Last W’ar

For instance it is very true that what other men
wrote and said about the last World war had a pow-
erful effect on us all as does all objective writing.
But it is wholly false to assume that we “developed a
logic-proof conception of ﬁghting as an evil for which
there was no reason, and which could always be avoided
by simply looking the other way.”

There are plenty of reasons for war: and we youth
don’t avoid war “by simply looking the other way.”
The great majority of students know very well that
Hitler is ﬁghting for property and power against prop-
erty and power. And they know that in England the
people are ﬁghting for their lives in part, and in part
they are ﬁghting for an empire ill-gained and ill-run.
We took war out of context . . .

The Dartmouth editors speak for themselves ap-
parently. They acknowledge their mistakes. Nobody
else made such stupid mistakes; we are glad they realize
their stupidity.

. established it as the supreme horror .

War is the supreme horror? Why? Simply be-
cause taking one man’s life is immoral in our culture;
therefore mass killing is supremely immoral, or effemi-
nately, a “horror.”

. said without realizing it:
anything is better than war.

Only the paciﬁsts say “anything is better than war.”
And though they’re probably right, they don’t speak
for all youth. Some of the majority may have said,
“Many things are better than an imperialist war, empty
of hope for those who must ﬁght it.” Some may have
said, “Why die for the British empire.” But this busi-
ness of identifying everybody with somebody else is
underhanded.

The Change

Why can’t we go on? Why can’t we recognize the
fact of war and all its terror, recognize that we want
to live, recognize that England is not Utopia, recog-
nize that we are taking grave risks—and still advo-
cate aid against Germany?

Y’know what happened to the Dartmouth liberals?
They probably once believed that getting rid of war
was a desirable aim, or that the Roosevelt administra-
tion was moving toward a socialized state, or that if
monopoly imperialism were to be got rid of, a num-
ber of acute world problems might be solved.

Then they had to stop’ and watch the world disin-
tegrate. And their political and economic leaders
placed a hand on their shoulders and a hand over their
eyes and said, “Boys, I’m afraid you’ll have to stop
thinking about this reform business. We elders have
helped stir up a little war here, and we need some-
body to ﬁnish it. Will you please forget about your
desire to solve certain problems and change certain
situations?

After the War

“Then after you’ve cleaned up that mess, you can
come back and worry about the U. S. and the rest of
the world in a more leisurely fashion. The present
strain on your powers of concentration are much too
much for such young, immature minds. That’s right,
lay down your shovel and take this nice shiny riﬂe,
and just follow the fellow in front of you. That won’t
injure your mind.” — ' ’

And the Dartmouth liberals listened to the magic
words, laid down the shovel, took up the riﬂe, and
started y marching.

What do we ﬁght for? The even break to make a
better democracy, a chance to work for good houses
and food and jobs and self—d.etermination. That is all.
A chance.

The Dartmouth liberals are frustrated no longer.
At last they can let go.

It is time we got tough. It is time we took chances.

""3 Transit

by Mendell Gross

Using the New York Times want
ad section as a barometer one has
ample evidence that these are boom
days for the fraternal order of the
“slip-stick.” Last Sunday's ads
called for twelve engineers--four
industrials, three mechanicals, two
electricals, and one each of civil,
chemical, and metallurgical. In ad-
dition to these individual ads, agen-
cy space called for about 20 engi-
neers.

0 The Growing Rolls

These agency wants are not a true
measure of positions open because
frequently an agency advertises
only to expand its list of applicants.
The wages offered range between
$25 per week for novice time-study
men to $6,500 per year for exper-
ienced process engineers.

Of the seven experienced men
looking for positions, six are cur-
rently employed and are seeking to
better themselves. One of these
men states that he will accept a
minimum of $7,500 per year, plus
bonus.

0 Market D1-egs

That the times are most favora-
ble to engineers, or perhaps, that ac-
countants are dregs on the market,
is indicated in comparable informa-
tion regarding these post—Bus-Ads.
Thirty-ﬁve accountants, some with
a master’s degree, are ‘advertising
for work. These men average ﬁve
and‘ one-half years experience, but
not one of them has the courage to
indicate the salary he desires. If
this is disheartening to the “busi-
ness boys” they may ﬁnd some
solace in the seven ads by attorneys
seeking Dositions.

Before any law or business stu-
dent changes his mind and wants to
transfer to Dean Holbrook’s fold,
he had better make up his mind that
before graduation he will have to
hurdle calculus, mechanics, and
drawing, and that after graduation
he will have to work in a dirty shop
for several years hoping that there
won’t be a depression.

When the depression comes, the
engineer, unless married to the boss’
daughter, must hang-on on a “few
days a week” and pray for another

Varsity Football Team

Without the consent of schedule
* maker Jimmy Hagan, old man win-

.‘ ter will be the varsity gridsters’ ﬁrst

4 opponent next Monday afternoon
‘when they attempt to stage outdoor
‘spring football drills.

Last spring football practice was
. postponed . frequently because of
‘snow, rain, or a combination of

" both. This year Coach Bowser and

‘his coaching aids are sitting in their
‘oﬁces, hoping, as they look out of
their windows, that there will be

‘no repeat performances.

‘ Practice will be longer and hard-
er this spring, for graduation hit
the Bowsermen severely. Only four
first team men will return to action
this year.

Bill Daddio, end coach of the var-
sity, has the stiffest job ahead. Four
of his ﬁrst ﬁve ends received sheep-
skins. Stan Gervelis will be the
only holdover for the end position.

The pivot postis, at the present

-time, in the best condition. George
Allshouse, Steve Sinco, and Jack
Heister will be ﬁghting for the
starting job.

In the backﬁeld, under Coaches
Greene, and Stebbins, Edgar “Spe-
cial Delivery” Jones will carry the
burden of the attack. The loss of
burly George Kracum will leave a

big hole to ﬁll, but George Ross,

Top-Notch Eastern College Quintets

Pitt received a gift from an unexpected source last Monday
evening. And today, thanks to the generosity of the Duquesne
basketball team, the Panthers were preparing to challenge for the
most coveted of basketball honors, the National Collegiate Athletic

association championship.

ceedings was hearty, pink-thatched

Dukes Get Bid

Although some members of the
District committee favored Pitt as
first choice for the tourney, their
ﬁnal decision was to kill possible
charges of favoritism by inviting
the Dukes. Duquesne’s refusal left
the way open for the Panthers to
return to the midwestern scene of
their early season triumphs.

Pitt’s competition in the Eastern
playoffs at Madison will come from
Big Ten champion Wisconsin, East-
ern Intercollegiate conference title-
holder Dartmouth, and Southern
conference leader North Carolina.

Comparative records reveal two
clear rays of hope for the Panthers.
North Carolina dropped a decision
to Panther victim Duke in the
Southern conference playoffs. And
the Carlsonites stopped Wisconsin
in the season’s opener. The Badg-
ers have come up fast since then,
however, and are considered the
toughest Eastern division hurdle to
Pitt’s championship hopes.

With spring sports a few weeks
away, and winter’s indoor competi-
tion a thing of the past, James Potts,
director of intramurals, has an-
nounced plans for the annual all-
campus swimming meet.

‘ The independents will set prece-
dent this year when they will stage
the ﬁrst meet, instead of the frater-
nities. Coach Ben Grady will again
be ihcharge of all meets in Trees
pool, and has set March 25 at 4:30
o’clock for the independent league
fracas.

Last year’s meet was the ﬁrst of
itskind in the University, and the
huge turnout showed keen student
The rules and events will

be the same, and entries from in-
dependent ranks must be taken to
Mr. Potts’ office.

Following closely on the heels
of the independents will be the boys
from Thaw Hall. Their meet will
be on March 27 at 4:30. The engi-
neers, usually regarded as. the weak-
est of the three circuits, gave the
fraternities and independents much
to worry about last year when they
walked away with a large share of
the glory.

The fraternity eliminations be-
gin on April 1 at 4:30 o’clock, and
the ﬁnals will be held on April 3.
Pi Kappa Alpha, Phi Gamma Delta,
Delta Tau Delta, and Phi Epsilon Pi
took most of the ﬁrst place prizes
last year, and should again be count-
ed. upon to give creditable show-
ings.‘ , _

The climax of the individual
swimming meets will be held on
April 15 a-t 4:30 o’clock. This all-
campus meet will pit the three cir-
cuits against each other.

Volleyhallers

Six old men beat the cream of
the fraternity volleyball league, the
Phi Gams,' last Saturday, 15-6,
15-3, 15-6, 15-8, 15-6.

These old men, to make matters
more unbelievable, were from the
faculty. We didn’t believe it either,
so we checked; we asked their cap-
tain, Dr. Ellwood Amos, about it.

“Well,” he chuckled, “I guess they

didn’t believe we could do it. But
we did.” “Chuckle, chuckle.”

Members of the faculty who took
part in the battle included Herb
Olander, Dr. Ben Williams, H. H.
Green, A. L. Robinson, Carroll
Reynolds, and Amos.

Their opponents had “Stoney”
Bitner, Joe Campbell, Bill Clem-
mer, Earl Pres-sel, and Clayton Pot-
ter on the ﬂoor.

Convinced that it was all a mis-
take, the Phi Gams have demanded
a rematch. Fiji adherents look
for a victory, but Dr. Amos is still
chuckling.

Varsity Swimmers
Head for Nationals

After taking an unexpected sec-
ond place in the Eastern Collegiates,
an improved Panther swimming
team will next be represented in
the National Collegiate skirmishes
scheduled for March 28 and 29.

Some of the best swimmers in the
country will be competing in the
meet. Michigan, Ohio State, Illi-
nois, -Cornell, Yale, and Harvard
are among the schools that are
planning to send title-holding mer-
men. Grady’s boys aren’t expect-
ing to do much damage among the
superior opponents, but the Nation-
al Collegiate offer a good way of
gaining experience.

 

Four Panthers
To Butler Meet

Captain Tregoning
Conﬁned to Hospital

BULLETIN-—-Coach Carl Olson
last night decided to take four
members of the Pitt track squad
to the Butler Relays. All will
compete individually, and the Pan-
thers will not enter a relay team.
Men making the trip ‘are Bill Car-
ter, sprinter; Joe Newman, hurd-
ter; Doyle Rhoades and Maurice

J essup, pole vaulters.
* * *

Bad breaks never seem to
escape the Pitt trackers. Last
week the Panthers were in ﬁne
physical condition’ and almost
didn’t get‘ to the Central Inter-
collegiate conference champion-
ships. This week, assured a trip
to the Butler relays, the Olson-
coached squad is riddled by in-
juries and won't be at Indianapolis
tomorrow afternoon and evening.

For several years Pitt teams have
ﬁgured high in the scoring in the
annual relay carnival; the mile re-
lay teams of the Woodruff era
walked away with top honors, and
Bill Carter tied a record in winning
the 60-yard dash last year, while
Johnny Bazyk, now graduated, cap-
tured the shot put medal.

Following their creditable show-
ing last week-end, the Pitt athletes
were conceded a
chance of win-
ning several in-
dividual titles,
and possibly the
relay if every
man were in con-
dition. However,
Hap Stickel ag-
gravated his leg
injury at South
Bend and was
scratched from
the 60-yard dash
and 60-yard low
hurdles.

The most seri-
ous misfortune to befall the Panth-
ers didn’t occur until this week,
however. Larry Tregoning, star
quarter miler, is now lying in an
Altoona hospital and will probably
be out for the season.

Early this week Tregoning slipped
on an icy pavement in Oakland
and suffered internal injuries from
contact with the curb. The serious-
ness of his injury has not yet been
determined, but he will probably
be out for the season. Trigger, the
regular leadoff man on the mile
relay team, would normally have
yielded his berth to Stickel, but
since the latter can’t run, Olson has
only three quarter milers, Regis
Larkin, Bud Graf, and Del Ander-
son.

WAA Dance Group
Seeks Members

Since the WAA dance group is
preparing for an early spring pro-
gram, the new modern dance studio
which has just been co-mpleted on
the -thirty-second ﬂoor has been
made available for the group both
Tuesday and Thursday afternoons
from 3 until 6 o’clock.

All women students who would
like to learn the modern dance, and
those who are interested, are asked
to attend the meetings of the group
at those scheduled hours.

Members of the dance club will
dress in the gymnasium locker room,
and will be taken up to the thirty-
second ﬂoor by a special elevator.

Before Opening Contel  

. By JOHN CHAI-‘F0

With only a little more than two
weeks remaining before their open-
ing game with Ohio State, the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh baseball team
is practically praying f0I‘ 3 break in
the weather. Thus far this year,
the Panthers have been unable to
engage in any practice sessions out-
doors.

Unless the Pitt team gets their
hoped-for break in the weather, the
Panthers will be in a pitiful shape
to meet a reputedly strong State
nine. The fact that the Blue and
Gold has had to carry on their drills
on the diamond beneath the Sta-

dium may seriously affect their
chances of victory.

Veterans Not Reporting

In nearly all the practices held,
the Pitt baseballers have merely
undergone preliminary workouts.
The Panthers have concentrated
largely upon loosening up exercises
and light batting practice.

Also a serious problem for the
Pitt coaching staff is the fact that
many of the athletes from last sea-
son have failed to put in regular ap-
pearances. Many of the baseball-
ers evidently will report as soon as
the team goes outdoors to practice.

In spite of the fact that they are
getting a bad deal from the weather,
the Pitt nine should be more than a
mere threat to collegiate baseball
teams this year. Many of_ those
teams which handed the Panthers
defeats last year are in for plenty
of trouble this season. ‘

Stiﬂ? Road Trip

Most of Pitt’s Optimistic baseball
followers are counting upon the
wealth of veteran material to carry
the team to the most successful cam-
paign since the sport was revived
several years ago. A large group
of the Panther athletes who are
back from the 1940 schedule have
added plenty of ﬁnesse to their
game‘ since the season closed last
year.

Should the Panthers gain a Win
over the Buckeyes in their opener,

they may be well on the road to-

ward a great season. Following the
State match, Pitt will begin a road
tour which will include games with

  Johnson Warns of Lack
Of Purpose and Loyalty
  , In Opposition Program

. By EDGAR BIEGEL

L “The Role of the Loyal Opposition in a National Emergency” was
analyzed-by Louis W. H. Johnston, instructor in political science, at the
Social Science seminar last Wednesday.

Presenting the political phase of the seminar theme for the year,

phases of the national defense pro-
gram, Johnston deplored the con-
duct of the oﬁicial leaders of the
opposition in the U. S. today and
called for a genuine deﬁnition of
party objectives.

“Political democracy in America
will soon disappear unless a loyal
opposition develops a program with

A purpose and objective,” Johnston

summarized. As the oﬂicial leader
of the opposition, “Wendell Willkie
revealed the inadequacy of his con-
ception of the role when he imme-
diately endorsed and supported the
program of the government follow-
ing the November elections.” he
said. ‘
0 Disloyal Opposition

“The opposition to the president’s
program today is disloyal not only
to the government but to the demo-
cratic process. When the opposi-
tion party becomes so bankrupt as
to resort to mere name-calling, then
democracy is not a useful form of
crisis government. Authoritarian-
ism becomes the only alternative.

“Autocracy is inherent in the am-
bition of all government. Every
governor is a potential dictator, re-
gardless of his personal integrity.
Unless there is an informed and ac-
tive continuous free consent of the
governed, while civil liberties of the
individual are protected, democracy
will fail in the crisis. The French

. and German republics are bleeding

examples of this failure in party dis-
cipline, the lack of an informed
public, the increase in personal P01-
icy in contrast to national policy,”
Johnston recalled.

0 Democratic Government

The purposes of democratic gov-
ernment are (1) determine social
and economic objectives; (2) de-
velop a program to accomplish the
objectives; (3) institute reforms ll'l
constitutional principles that frus-
trate the program; and (4) reorgan-
ize procedural diiﬁculties thaxt hin-
der enforcement of the program.

The role of the Loyal Oppositi0I1
in the newspaper office and in Con-
gress today is one of revealing to
the public what the objectives of
the government are, what objectives
the opposition is aiming at, and the
alternative programs offered by the
government and opposition.

Johnston’s concept of the end
purposes of a Loyal OpD0Siti0n 31' 9
the promotion of “Government plan-
ning, direction, and coordination of
social and economic developmenrt”
in the U. S. “Private enterprise
must be ﬁtted into a social plan; but
this is possible only if the legalistic
conservatism that has shackled gov-

, ernment is thrown off.

0 Role of Executive

“The role of the executive as the
‘leader in legislative policy must
be accepted and respected if demo-
cratic government is to continue.
Otherwise the executive will be
tempted to substitute a government
of personal autocracy. Public op-
position to discipline within polit-
ical, parties is one of the contribut-
ing causes to the bankruptcy of any
real opposition party since 1912.
Opposition to the purge-campaign
of 1938 and the nomination of Wal-
lace last June show that the public
is not yet sold on the necessity for
executive leadership and party dis-

: cipline.”

Uh

“Until the opposition offers a rival
legislative program that is informal
and practicable, anti-administration
forces can only be called disloyal op-
position.

“Meanwhile the people are being
[lead anywhere. The government
is one step from autocracy.

DR. CHARLES G. KING
patented medicine

Dr. King Wins

Vitamin Patent

Dr. Charles G. King, professor
of chemistry, and the late Dr. Wil-
liam A. Waugh, a graduate of Pitt,
have recently won a patent on their
method of isolating pure anti—scurvy
vitamin C, it was announced today.

The crystalline, tasteless com-
pound which they isolated from
lemon juice and identiﬁed is one
that has been long sought by sci-
entists in its pure form. It is a
vitamin and a true chemical com-
pound. Called hexuronic acid, it
may be added to milk, bread, and
other foodstuffs. Because it IS
pure, it may also be given by in-
jection, and the dosage may be ex-
actly controlled.

The method of isolating the vita-
min involves ﬁrst decitrating the
lemon juice, then precipitating the
vitamin C with a basic lead com-
pound. This is followed by remov-
ing oily impurities, acids, and lead
salts. Other steps involve redis-
solving, precipitating, washing with
various solvents, evaporating to
dryness, and then crystallizing from
alcohol solutions.

The University’s concert band
will present its second performance
of the present season tonight, when
it appears at McKeesport High
school.

Consisting of 65 selected music-
ians irom the 120-piece marching
unit, the concert band will this year
play the most extensive schedule of
appearances in its entire history, ac-
cording to Jack Mullin, E41, man-
ager. The group already is booked
to play over sixty concerts, appear-
ing in cities throughout the middle
Atlantic states.

The band is under the direction
of Robert L. Arthur. Student oili-
cers of the organization include Mul-

lin; Jack Toerge, BA41, student di-
rector; Harold Hauger, C41, asso-
ciate manager; Rudolph Janata,
C41, cadet major; and Robert C.
Dalzell, C41, librarian.

Last year’s concert season was
regarded as successful by the band
staff, declared Mullin, since it ap-
peared before well over ﬁfty thou-
sand persons, and attracted as many
as three thousand to a single per-
formance.

The program presented by the
band will represent one of the most
completely rehearsed in its history.
according to Mullin, with the band
averaging three rehearsals a week
since the end of football season.

she suggested that American busi-
ness men be stimulated to invest
money in industrial plants in South
America, on a dollar-for-dollar
basis. This, she explained would
give the people of South America
the feeling that they were partici-
pating in their own industrializa-
tion, and that this industrialization
was not merely a new form of ex-
ploitation by North American cap-
ital.

“Then too,” she pointed out, “if
the people of South America them-
selves have an equal share in the
development of their own indus-
tries, with cooperation from the
United States, it would do much to
combat a good deal of ill-feeling
that has been built up through years
of our economic imperialism, char-
acterized by the old U. S. policy of
‘cash, counsel, and coercion'.”

And those qualities depend considerably upon the way

your cigarette burns.

Camels burn slower— deﬁnitely. That’s a well-established
