reports yet from the graduates who
attended the Pitt Band Concert at
Carnegie Music Hall Friday, April 5.
While the attendance of alumni at
this concert was fair, it was not what
it -should have been, and it is our hope
that the Pitt Band Management will
put on a. similar concert next year

concert was without doubt one of the
best ever given by‘ an activity of’ this
kind, and was a great credit to all
who participated.

The Editor has been in touch with
many of the alumni who attended,
and all of them are loud in their
praise of the performance. Many of
these alumni were especially interest-
ed because they played in the band
themselves while ' un-dergraduaates.
One of the prominent ones was Dr.
Don I. Kirk, who had a chat with the
writer during the intermission. Don
was the man who started the Pitt
band back in 1911. He was a comet-
ist of exceptional ability and develop-
ed the idea that Pitt should have a
band of its own. He was proud of the
performance at Carnegie Hall, and
said he never realized when he started
the band that it would grow to be
such a finished organization.

With the track team getting in swing, and already having competed in two important meets in the South,
that sport is very much in the limelight just now. The above picture of the 1907 team, showing some men who
are now very prominent in the alumni activities, will be of interest to “Pitt Weekly” readers. It was secured
from Dr. J. W. Shuman, whose picturecappears in the group, and who is now located in Sioux City, Iowa. Dr.
Shuman saw an article in “The Weekly” some time ago regarding the track activities around that time, and
xobligingly sent on the picture which we requested.

CREDIT DUE ZIEG
The kingpin of track affairs 15 years ago was W. W. (“Waldy”) Zieg.

He is deserving of a lot of credit
for the enthusiasm and spirit which he instilled in the track situation.

Zieg was not only a wonderful competitor

. in the weights, being good from 10 to 15 points in every meet he competed, but he was also an exceptional man-

ager. It was due to his painstaking efforts and pcrsistency that the Athletic -Committee started the annual Inter-
collegiate and Scholastic meets, which have become such a big project. In those days Zieg did not have a flock
of assistant managerswho were willing to write letters for him, run errands, provide automobiles, etc. -It. was
all up to Zieg, and he worked late into the nights for several weeks before that big meet in order to get all the
details perfected. When you mention the names of those who have done a lot for the University in athletics don’t
forget “Waldy” Zieg. ' , '

Zieg graduated from the Mines School, «class of 1910. He is now one of the prominent ﬁre insurance ad-

The Class of 1914 and others will
be glad to hear from Clare Griffin
Schweinberg, whose home is now in
Gary, Indiana, at 525 Madison
street: “I receied the card yesterday
announcing the_ Alumnae Luncheon
and certainly regret that I am unable

to attend. . . ‘I must tell you a
little about our babies. Did you know
we had two? Well, Jack is the ﬁrst

sweeter child. He is a little fat, red-
cheek-ed, brown-eyed dumpling, just
as frisky as a young colt. Jimmie is
the babe. only four months old and.
commonly known as Skeezi, copied
from W-alt, of course. He "is too
small to say much about, but never-
theless is a wonderful child. . .
The notice in last week's Pitt Weekly
tickled me,-——of George Ketchu-m’s
new babe. I also may be able to give
a few pointers about getting up in
the middle of the night when the
steam is turned oﬂ’-—-. .
teaching music in the Gary schools.
"Ever since I came here.I had a little
sneaking desire to teach, so just as
soon as the opportunity afforded it-
self I -got me a housekeeper and re-
tained the maid I had and staited
in. - I thoroughly enjoy the work and
it is quite interesting to become -more
familiar with the Gary System of
teaching. . Kindly remember

me to my friends if you see them.”

Several weeks ago the Pittsburgh
newspapers carried a notice of the
April meeting of the Travellers’ Club
at which Grace Sefton Mayer was the
soloist. Grace was well known in her
class of 1917, but not in a musical
way." She saved that until later and
now, after. studying under Blanche
Saunders Walker of Pittsburgh, and
Oscar Sa-en-ger, of New York, she is
receiving much favorable comment.
Her home is at 346 Lincoln street,

Beforelgn audience of over 600, the

University‘ of Pittsburgh"Band held

its ﬁﬁt ‘annual concert on Wednesday ,

evening, April 5, in the Carnegie
Music -Hall. Under the able direc-
tion «of . William “Gregory the
.band‘ rendered a splendid program.
This concert is highly indicative of

'the«unusual‘ capacity of the -Pitt Band.‘

In the words of the music critic of
the Pittsburgh Dispatch, o“The first
annual-‘concert of the University of

cPit_tAsburgh Band, demonstrated. be-
yond»d'o.ubt that the ‘capacity of‘ the
providing

band, is notllimited‘ to

gmpusic for ‘football games.”

The ‘success of the band was greatly
en-hanced bythéy cornet solos rendered
by “Eddie”. Specter, the bass solo by
Gustave Duve, and the playing. of
Robert ‘Groman.’~; H ‘  0 _

Too much credit cannot be given to
“Bill”, Gregory} who so ably‘ directed
the work of the band. Due to the
initiative of Man'ager'J Christain,
the University Band‘ gave. a ‘concert
in New Brighton , on April 7. This
concert‘ was given under the auspices

~ of the. Brighton. Women’s_ Clubs and
was accorded a hearty reception.

The following review appears in

the Dispatch of April 6:

“The program was happily de-
bvoidhﬂf all the childish comedy
‘-that forever has been deemed

necessary for all school entertain-
ments, but it remains a mystery
.why the conductors of these clubs
do not ibestir -themselves some-
‘what_ toward -attempting‘ more of ,
‘the lighter classics. ~ The “Poet,
and Peasant”, and Dvorak«’s “Hu- '
moresque” were played, but these
[works have long since been‘.rele-
‘. tgated. t-o the repertory of the
player ;=p'—iano.; ‘the Brahms’ Hun-
-garian Dance No. 5, was a wel-
comé‘‘1pffering. 1' Many old favor-
ites among the standard marches
-of Sousa and Rocereto completed
the ba:n«d’s’oﬁ"erings. ‘ ‘ , g .
An unusually good corn-eti-st,
Edward Specter,‘ played a num-
ber of solos; Gustus D. Dure was
.much ‘applauded for his bass solo,
and the violin‘ solo, an air from
“Thais,” by Robert Gr-oman was
well received. Oliver E. Evans‘
and K‘. F. Miller p1ayed'adequat;e
accompaniments‘. William Greg-
ory, director of the band, is to be ,
complimented for his work
toward good ens-e‘mb1e and ryithm.
