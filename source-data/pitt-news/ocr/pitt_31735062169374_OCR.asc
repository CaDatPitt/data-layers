Cinematheque Plans Film

by HOBART HARRIS

Ideas and Figures, the Campus
literary‘ magazine, is sponsoring
a new ﬁlm series called “Cine-
matheque.” The series to be su-
pervised by Jim Dalglish, a grad-
uatestudent in English. Its pur-
pose, according to Dalglish, is “to
present ﬁlms that have been rare-
ly seen in Pittsburgh, and to pre-
sent them in "an intelligent man-
ner.” ’

Dalglish referred to his proposed
method of presentation as “a
kind of celebration.” He plans to
precede each_ presentation of a
ﬁlm in the series with .a short
introduction, which will touch on
the ﬁlms’ signiﬁcance to the art
as a Whole, and list the credits.

“This has never been done be-

fore at Pitt,” Dalglish said. “I"

was extremely disappointed in
the audience’s reaction to Ivan

_ the Terrible. which was shown

in the Student Union last week.
The audience felt that it was
pure entertainment, but did not
know of the signiﬁcance of the
ﬁlm.

“I feel that the audience can
get more enjoyment from. know-
ing about a ﬁhn,” he continued.
He pointed out that the ﬁrst pre-
sentation in the Cinematheque
series, Carnival in Flanders had
provided the audience with this
enjoyment. “The audience re-
sponded to the movie as a group,”
he said. “For the ﬁrst time in
my memory the audience clapped
after the movie.”

The next ﬁlm in the series,
Storm Over Asia, will be present-
ed this Tuesday night in Clapp
Hall at 8:30 p.m. Other ﬁlms that '
Dalglish hopes to acquire for the

 Pitt News Review

by LESLIE HART .
, Movie critics, I would like to
 make clear, are creatures not to
 be confused with movie review-
ers. The latter are capable, on the
v/hole,’of less sense, less rigor,
and less effort to resign their
conflicts of judgment before they
appear in print. I have few illu-
sions about the distances that sep-
arate James Agee and Bosley
Crowther from myself, and it is
with these distinctions ﬁrmly in

gitimate criticism and permitting
myself to wonder aloud why, of
the two movies now playing at
the Strand, Seance on a Wet Af-
-ternoon pleases me less than The
_ Sleeping-Car Murder.
‘Sleeping-Car presents nothing

 Stanley offers in Seance: indeed,
 the movie is digniﬁed by what_
 she ‘allows to happen in her char-
 acterization of an insensitive,

portrayal of submission that cine-
matic justice requires we ignore
him; his half-‘closed eyes and
completely closed face in the
ﬁrst scenes provide comment and
foil for Miss Stanley, and remind

', tionally sensitive and sweet-tem-

McCall’s Publishes Survey

 

Evaluating Nation’s Colleges

by BEVERLY TAYLOR
Sex? Husband? Booze? No
matter what a college-bound
student is seeking, aside
from scholarship, of course,
~ there’s a school prominent in
his field of interest-. He need
only consult a recent poll con-
ducted by McCall’s which shows
promise of appearing on every
elert high school counselor’s desk.
McCall’s, deciding to seek the
aid of the best-informed students
of the nation’s colleges, naturally
called‘ upon student newspaper

editors. ’
Only 97, questionnaires were

Military Ball Queen

_ escort.

returned, but McCall’s, happily
making no claim to statistical
validity, was impressed;by a few
overall patterns‘: First, student
editors, as suspected, do have
some notion of what is going on
at campuses all over the coun-
try. Collectively, their answers
named schools in all 50 states
and even included Electoral Col-
lege, where one editor noted the
members have the least voice in
running things.

‘Second, several gyneral char-
acter ‘traits were consistently
linked with certain schools, such
as. the training ground for future
Presidents was said to be Har-
vard, Yale, West Point, or South-
west Texas State College (Lyn-"
don B. Johnson’s alma mater).
Also, the “most square” college
was said to be Bob Jones Univer-
sity of South Carolina, where the
Rever.end Billy Graham spent his
undergraduate years. At the same
time, some interesting puzzles
turned up. Harvard, it was felt,
draws not only the “most liberal
men” but the “most stereotyped”

as well. And Vassar attracts the
brightest and the dullest girls.
Third, the editors weren’t afraid
to speak the truth, as they saw it,
about the colleges and the ques-
tionnaire. One diligent student
who answered every question on
his form complained: “This is
. without doubt the most absurd
and "inane waste of time I have
ever experienced. Please do not
pester us with such junk in the
future.”

tionnaire encouraged a spirit of
independent thinking here, which
is ‘quite unusual in an adminis-
tration -oppreessed student body
such as ours.”

Those who search for sexual

freedom will ﬁnd it useful to
know that the student editors

agreed “the most promiscuous” ’

men and women are at‘Ber_keley;
promiscuous women also can be
found at Vassar and Radcliffe and
~ their male counterparts at Har-
vard and NYU. I

NSA Sees Setbacks

In Internat’l Program

by RITA DERSHDWITZ .

WASHINGTON, D.C. (CPS) — Most of the students

who are now staff members or once worked for the U.S. Na-
tional Student Association are-reacting with surprise and
dismay to the disclosure of NSA’s connection with the Gen-

tral Intelligence Agency.

One of the officers received a one-line telegram: “Say

it ain’t so.” _

Apparently only a few staff
members were aware of the situa-
tion, and in the past only those
officers and staff members who
had signed security agreements
with the CIA knew. This year’s
administration is the ﬁrst in
many years in which no one has
signed such an agreement.

The story broke with a full-
page advertisement for the March
issue of Ramparts magazine in
Tuesday’s New York Times and
Washington Post. The main au-
thor of the article, which was
advertised as exposing CI-A in-
ﬁltration of the student groups,
is Michael Wood, who ‘was ﬁred
as an NSA staff member last Sep-
tember.

In a release Tuesday after-
noon, NSA conﬁrmed the ﬁnan-
cial connection,-and the State De-
pertment-added its conﬁrmation
of the 12-year affiliation at a
press conference. ‘

A former NSA staff mem.ber,
Vance Op p e r In a n, commented
that he was “very, very ashamed
that I might have had any part
in CIA activities.”
a graduate student at the Univer-
sity of Minnesota, charged that

I the International Commission of

the Association had always been
“secretive,” and that “a few peo-
ple had control of the money and
of the staff and they were able
to be almost self-per'petuatirig.”
Howard Kaibel, president of
the University of Minnesota Stu-
dent Association and a member
of NSA’s National Supervisory
Board, said that the disclosure
“is drastically going to hurt our
international program — it’s go-

ing to hurt our credibility in in-
 , ternational programming.” '

A move to sever the Associa-
tion’s ties with the CIA appar-
ently began ﬁve years ago, when
the officers attempted to ﬁnd

.other sources of ﬁnancing. Those

attempts failed until about a year
when open grants began
coming in from foundations and
government agencies such as the
Office of Economic Opportunity.

When new officers took over

Opperrnan, .

last September, they resolved to I

sever all remaining ties with the
CIA witho=ut publicly revealing
what they were doing. NSA Pres-
ident Eugene Groves talked about
that decision:

.“It’s an awesome moral choice
to face when one is‘ﬁrst told all

-the details. If we had ‘immediately

revealed the connection, it could
have harmed a hell of a lot_ of
innocent people. First we had to
get the Association in a position
of independent ﬁnancing,” he
said. I

NSA officials claimed ‘that only
$50,000 came from the CIA at the
beginning of this academic year;
$25,000 has been expended, the
rest was turned. down. As of Jan-
uary 1, all subsidy was ended.

NSA’s statment conﬁrming the
relationship declared:

“The relationship apparently
originated because of the Gen-

_ Vtral Intelligence Agency believed

that a strong American national
union of students acting interna-
tionally was in the national in-
terest. The funds from the Gen-
tral Intelligence Agency suppport-
ed a number of projects, assisting
student groups abroad and par-
tially supporting the staff neces-
sary to maintain continuing con-
tact with student organizations
in other countries.

“We believe that USNSA is car-
rying forward many useful and

NSA For

. WASHINGTON D. C. (CPS)—
The “new left” and the “new
right” have united in their ‘op-
position to the National Student
Association, following disclosure
this week of a 12-year relation-
ship between NSA and CIA.
Paul Potter, a former national
affairs vice-presiden_t of NSA,
charged that the Association’s
current officers “are still lying”
about sources of NSA’s funds.
’One of the founders of Stu-
dents for Democratic Society
(SDS), Potter commented that no-
NSA statments on the CIA situa-
tion had admitted the intelligence
agency's alleged support of NSA’s
major ﬁnancial aid, the Founda-
tion for Youth and Student Af-
fairs (FYSA) of New York. (Pot-
ler’s statement was made previ-
ous to that disclosure by NSA.)
Potter said that “lots of peo-
ple in and around NSA” had sus-
pected the CIA connection for
many years. He claimed that the
rumors of an NSA-CIA link had
not been investigated in previous
years, however, because it seem-
ed “a paranoid, upsophisticated,
and utterly dogmatic thing ever
to consider.”

people as the only serious na-,
tional student organization, Pot-
ter said. Although he speculated
that NSA would not disband, Pot-
. ter added, “I would be surprised
if they were able to keep very
many students with them. It will
be very difficult for NSA to re-
cover the respect or trust of stu-
dents in this country.”
Potter charged that “the pat-
tern of lying is just built into
the very guts of the organiza-

tion.” He said athovrough inves-
tigation of the CIA connection
should be conducted, and called
for an NSA constitutional conven-
tion.

On the political right, the Young
Americans for Freedom (YAF)
issued a statement expressing
“deep shock that the CIA should

secretly attempt to influence stu- ‘

dent opinion."

But YAF national vice-chair-
man also commented, “We are
absolutely astounded to discover

Kthat federal funds in huge
amounts have been placed in the
hands of irresponsible leftists
who do not represent American
students.”

For several years, YAF has led
a “Stop NSA” campaign, charg-
ing that the Association’s politics
were left-wing and against the
national interest.

YAF called for a Congressional
investigation to determine wheth-

er there had been a “violation by i

 

NSA of the federal law prohibit- ’ '

ing tax-exempt groups from seek-
ing to inﬂuence legislation before

Congress” and whether the CIA *

subsidy violates “the federal law
prohibiting the use of federal
funds to inﬂuence legislation be-
fore Congress.”

David Jones, YAF’s executive

director, said he expected NSA to
collapse, and added, “We won't
miss it very much.” He called the

current NSA controversy "a les- 

son for the student left."

Commenting that “this is not .

going to hinder the activity” of

 Off-Campus Ho

Last week Student Government took up an important project which
"can be of immense importance to student life, the University community

and the entire Pittsburgh community. Student Government stepped into
. the previously untouched area of discrimination in off-campus housing for

The clause on discrimination was an amendment to a bill introduced

by ﬁve senators to establish a student committee on off-campus housing.

The original bill, unto itself, was an excellent innovation. It stated that the

committee would work with the Director of Off.-Campus Housing tosecure

 more off.-campus housing opportunities for students. The committee will

"also investigate these housing units and make a thorough report which
 would be available to all students. The committee will not “approve” any\
“of the housing but will simply issue _a report. ' i
In investigating the housing conditions themselves, the Student Gov-
. ernment will be doing an immense service to those whom they represent.

there is a war going on. Ap-
parently, then, I must say to
myself that war equals death

haps this is possible to do,
not to excuse war but to rec-
ognize it. But if I cannot
condone war then I cannot

ican tactics currentlyin use
in Vietnam, that is, the ill-
treatment of civilians by the
United States-

The most despicable of I

these tactics is the em-
ployment of napalm, a jelly-
like derivative of gaso-
line, in fire bombs for the
wholesale destruction of wide
geographic areas. In theory,
the areas to be bombed are
ﬁrst cleared of all civilian
population. Yet this is ludi-
crous when it is realized that
precisely those people the
napalm is intended to des-
troy, the Viet Cong, are ci-
vilians. And so the practical

’ becomes obvious: the popula-

tions are not removed. They
burn along with their vil-
lages.

THE- UNITED States is
the only nation in the world
using napalm, which adheres
to anything it touches, in-
cluding human ﬂesh, burn-
ing furiously. In addition, a
napalm ﬁre is almost impos-
sible to extinguish.

Inexcusable also is the
fact that the United States
does not provide medical

But, the people of Vietnam,
their skins literally melted
by the clinging napalm, their
bodies torn by bomb frag-
ments, are forced to fend for
themselves.

Of course, there are some
American medical teams
working among Vietnamese
civilian victims. But there
‘can: never--bégenough physi-

many people, _just seared by

trust their lives to a doctor
from the very same nation ?

THE UNITED States Con-
stitution prohibits the use of
cruel and unusual punish-
ishments, yet is it not cruel
and unusual to burned alive‘?
The German use of poison
gas in the First World War,
with its lingering death, was
subsequently prohibited, yet
napalm victims often survive
the original attack only to
die of infection. And ﬁnally,

attend a social affair spon-'

is our fault, as American ci-

continues, and we must de-

Women Object ’
To ROTC Actions

Editor, The Pitt News:

Last Thursday the Coed Affili-
ate of Pershing Riﬂes (CAPER)
held its ﬁrst organizational meet-
ing. Sponsored by Company K-5
of the Pershing Riﬂes, these girls
planned to form a drill team to
march in competition with other

‘ girls’ drill teams, to serve our

ﬁghting men in Vietnam by send-
ing necessary supplies, and to co-
sponsor social functions with the
IRS. These activities, we feel, are
worthy and there should be no
reason why such a group could
no-t exist.

Nevertheless, LTC Ward Garee
of the ROTC department has re-
fused to support the organiza-
tion, and without his support,
CAPER, according to national
speciﬁcations, cannot be charter-
eci. Not only did LTC. Garee re-
fuse support, however, but he
indicated to PR CPT and Caclet
Col. J. Brise Bickerton‘ that any
PR support for CAPERS would
result in Bickerton’s losing his
commission and in action vir-
tually terminating the Army ca-
reers of other members of the
Pershing Riﬂes. ‘

Such coercion‘ we feel is not to be

tolerated. Our speculation is that

LTC. Garee is interested in saving
the newly-organized Army Blues
from demoralizing competition.
This need not be the case because
the purpose of Army Blues, which
is merely to march with H the
ROTC cadets, would not inter-
sect any purpose of CAPER. Cer-
tainly a student body as large as
Pitt’s should‘ be able to support
both of these groups, and there is
no sound reason for these un-
necessary threats on the part of
LTC. Garee. In the United States
cf America it is truly deplorable
to ﬁnd such military ‘suppression
of an upstanding student organi-
zation.

Letters to the Editor

A simple objective statement of the facts should suffice.

The investigation of discrimination of housing is a “must,” but it is
also a subject which demands much sensitivity and diplomacy. All the bill
said that was one of the committee’s duties was to “investigate alleged
housing discrimination in,off—campus housing.” We suggest that the SG
group work with the Mayor’s Commission on Human" Relations ‘which is
located in the City-County Building. Under a new full coverage, the City
of Pittsburgh does not permit discrimination even in owner-occupied facil-
ities. Students who have had unfortunate experiences must report them to '
the committee which could then discuss these problems with members of

.- the Mayor’s Commission. I '

. We are proud that the Student Government has had the courage and
. foresight to deal with this problem. Working with professionals in the ﬁeld,
" the student committee shouldlbe able to bring down many of the present "

etc.‘ So help me, I saw one guy
applying pancake-last weekwith
what looked like a lipstick baton.

And let’s not forget the various ,

deodorants, shampoos, and the
like. What does the Pitt under-
graduate‘ have against smelling
like a human being? Is he afraid
that his peer group will reject
him if his elegantly-long coiflure
proves substandard?

I have become used to the fe-
male of the species wearing pants,
short hair, aggressive personality,
and preferring passive young
men whom she can control, with
ease—this is the cross the male
of the race has to bear, and it’s a
situation in large part of his own
making.

The other side of the coin,
however, is even less pleasing. A
"spate of sociological articles have
appeared lately on the disappear-
ance of sexual identiﬁcation in
America. Loving, it appears, is
something each has to do for him-
self, an individualistic notion dic-
tated by biology. The thought
horriﬁes the shallow, othe1'-di-
rected undergraduate of today

and he tries to deny his sexuality 

as much as possible. His guilty
conscience is salved by the mass
media, who'tell him that X hair
oil makes him more “masculine.”

"Nothing, of course, could be fur-

ther from the, truth but sublimi-
tal appeals to his fear of being a
psychological castrate hit their
mark — ‘rather than be called
queer he buys.

So pass on, O fruit-smelling

youth, when I meet you in the
corridor tomorrow. I don’t want
to talk to you, I'm forming a peer
group of my own!

, - During the past week, the Pitt News once_ again has
been receiving praise or criticism, depending on your sports
ideology, as that little child just can’t keep its fingers from
+g_etting_ dirty. . -
 Articles -in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and Press plus
gjroadcasts by the Joe Tucke.r Sports Report have _all given
credit to this column for calling for the firing of coach Bob
- " x C , Timmons. Jack Sell in the Post—Gazetteand .
Tucker have voiced their disdain for such
attacks. . ,
If these gifted sports reporters were

more concerned about the accuracy. of what
they report, they would realize that the Pitt

ouster. ,But since they claim that we’ve said
it, we feel it’s about time to say it.‘
In the last edition of Pittsburgh Weekly
. Sports,’ Jim O’Brien ran 7a ballot asking
 ether or not Pitt should retain Timmons. EVA has al-
eady’ predicted a landslide against Timmons and in accord-
ce with the American way we wish’ to cast our ballot with
 e‘f majority. , _ P in ‘
l.-For_the information ‘of those that would deny us this
,_1g‘ht, the Pitt News is the student organ for information.
It is financed through private advertising. No money for
publication is received from the Athletic Department. 0_ur
‘*‘ is not to cheerlead, but rather to report and analyze Pitt
ports as objectively as possible. ,
_If anyone were to conduct a poll of student opinion con-
erning the issue of the basketball coach, they could hardly
ignore the fact that the overwhelming majority like to see
.~a"-changei’made. ‘ *
‘Many have claimed that Bob Timmons is a really_ nice
y. We have no argument with" this. Jack Sell led into his
olumn with-the fact that Timmons has guided the Panthers
;three NCAA tournaments and one NIT during his 14
gr asons. He failed to mention the fact that Pitt has won’
.0 y'17 of its last 60 games. » C
; ; Tucker feels that in times like these Timmons needs
helping hand and that we should be that hand. This is a
- e expression of "sentiment from Tucker considering the
fact that he hasn’t seen‘ a Pitt game in the last three years.
“':iRef_erring to his critics, Timmons said, “It’s like wrest-
ng. with hog in the mud. Both ‘get dirty but only the hog
iij‘oys‘it."’ It might come as a surprise, but we derive _no
,s istic. joy fromicriticizing Timmons. It’s just the point
that all we’ve received from Watching Pitt basketball the
 three seasons is pain. ‘ g
N This season alone, the Panthers havelost seven games

y. more than 20 points. Four of those seven were lost by
ore than 30 points. Two more games were lost by 19 points.

lTwo crosstown rivals tangle this after-
ternoon at 4:30 p.m. at the Field House,
when the fresh basketball team hosts their
counterparts from Duquesne. Admission_ is

free. _
For the Cubs,‘revenge_ will be the order of the
day. In their earlier meeting at the Civic Arena,

the Little Dukes handed the frosh their only de- a

cisive defeat, a’ 93-59 pounding.

“We just had an off day,” explains freshman
coach Tim Grgurich. “We were really "cold. Our
shooting was the worst it’s been all~year. We shot
about 28%, and we just couldn’t get a spurt going
when we needed it. And then ‘their press really
hurt us.” A V

This time the Cubs vow that things will be
different. “It’s going to-be the best basketball
game‘ all year,” promises Cub forward Rob Mc-
Farland. ' ‘

Duquesne tried to play the fros-h man-to-man

last time and couldn’t. “We jumped all_over them,”

McFarland said, “but then we couldn’t crack their
zone.” The Cubs have been practicing against the
zonefor the‘ past week, and believe they are ready.

 

 

Grgurich doesn’t underestimate Duquesne.

“They’ve got good potential as far as quickness
goes, but I don’t thing they’ll be able to rebound
with us, and they’re hurting if we get them in foul
trouble. And they can’t play us man-to-man.”

The frosh will play Duquesne man-to-man, but
with a few adjustments from the last game. Bob
Petrini will guard Willie Hines, who scored 23
points last time, mostly on drives. “Bob’s strong
and he should be able to keep Hines away from the

- boards,” Grgurich explains.

This leaves Dick Hassinger and Bob Brickner the
task of stopping Bill Zopf, who hit for .24 tallys from
outside in the earlier meeting.

Grgurich also wants the Cubs to “take our time,
and relax on the offense. Our trouble last time was
that we hurried and shot without getting set.”

“This time we're going to move the ball and try
to get it inside on them. We’ll keep Patcher inside
on the boards and move McFarland outside a lit-
tle.” C

If Duquesne goes to a press, which is likely, then
“We have a couple of plays worked out for it,’?,
said Grgurich.
they’ll be ready too.”

“In general, it was a pretty

ning takedown.

Johnson considered Hoo'ver’s
three points a gift because State’s
Jim Emanuel moved up from 177
to replace Bob Funk at 191, but
he added, “Terry had a close
match with the same boy last
year because he didn’t go after
him. Today he did and looked

pretty good.” Hoover was brutal
in administering an 8-0 defeat.
Shildt won an easy 7-1 decision
over Craig Freas to move his rec-
ord this season to 5-3-1, the same
as Hoover, who is actually 5-1 in
his own-weight class. A win over
Syracuse this week will also give
Schuchert a winning season.

Lions Inflict Record — Setting

by JAY ROSENSTEIN

When Penn State won its
seventh straight game over
the Panther basketball team
Saturday afternoon, it meant
more than a reassertion of
the Nittany Lion dominence

evident the last three years.
The 87-73 victory couldn’t save
the Lions from a losing season,
but it did give the Panthers their
18th defeat,.and no eager team
had lost that many before.
State’s 2-3 zone defense stymied
the Panther offense in the ﬁrst
half, while their own attack had
no trouble piercing the cagers’
attempt at a zone. Paul Mickey
from inside and J eff Persson
from outside combined to run up
a 25-11 edge after 11 minutes.

18th Loss on Cagers, 87 —  

"Penn State expanded their lead

to 41-23, before settling for a 43-
29 halftime score.

Jim Linden and Joe McGovern
took over in the second half to
build a 21 point advantage, 64-43,
with nine minutes left in the

game. The Lions’ shooters had a —

ﬁeld day, making 48 per cent of
their attempts. If Garry Hayes
hadn’t gone 0-11 from the ﬂoor,
State’s shooting percentage would
have been over 60 per cent.

It wasn’t until after the nine
minute mark that the Panthers
could finally get untracked. Pete
Smith, Stan Falenski, and Steve
Stevenson started to close the
gap. A driving layup by Smith
brought the Panthers to within

15 points, a jump shot by Fa1en- .

ski cut it 13, and Stevenson’s

 

three jumpers made the score
79-69.

Then a bucket by a name out
of the past, Tony DeLisio, pro-
vided the cagers with a last gasp,
79-71, with 1:10 remaining, The
next six points, however, were
scored by State to preserve their
tenth win.‘

grabbed 16 rebounds, which
equaled Mickey’s total. The Lion

all, ﬁve Lions and four Panthers

the acceptance of CIA money.

Shaul, who had received a $500
scholarship from the CIA-linked
Independence Foundation, stated,
“In any fund-raising venture, you
lteve a very real problem of
strings being attached.”

He said that CIA ﬁnancing
helped send Americans overseas

with fewer restrictions than they
would have had under outright
government sponsorship.

“I had no more problems with
that money than I had with any
other money,” Shaul stated.

Carl Stoiber, NSA’s internation-
a’ affairs vice—president, admit-
ted that he had also known about

the CIA funds. Now a graduate
student at the University of Colo-
rado, Stoibcr said that getting
money from the Foundation for
Youth and Student Affairs, which
he admitted is a CIA front, was

not as complicated administra-

tively as getting money from

other foundations.
