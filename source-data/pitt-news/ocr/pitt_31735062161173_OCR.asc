Reconsider

Suspension

'I'he suspension of the University
of Connecticut chapter will be re-
:onsidered by Phi Epsilon Pi frat-
arnity at a special national conven-
zion Dec.27 and 28 in Philadelphia.

The Connecticut chapter was
:uspended, because it pledged a
legro.

News from other college papers
and local opinion indicate that
strong support is building up for the
return of the Uconn chapter to the
Phi Ep fold. '

J The News was not able to con-
:act Irv Faigen, president of the
Pitt Phi Epsilon Pi chapter, for
comment on the controversy.

_The fra,terr1ity’s Grand Council
‘started the battle when it black-
fballed Uconn pledge Al Rogers,
fprespident of his class and right
tackle on the varsity football team.
WV/hen the Connecticut chapter
defied the Grand Council’s rejec-
ftion of their pledge and decide to
gtnitiate Rogers, the national of-
fficers moved to suspend the chapter
 confiscate its assets. At the
gregular national convention at Minne-
fapolis in September, the member
apters sustained the Grand Coun-
l’s move by a 22-11 vote.
The Pitt chapter was among those
upporting the action at the time.
_ Howard Spivak, president of the
ufts College Phi Ep chapter,
hich voted against this suspen-
ion, was q‘uoted in a national
eekly Jewish newspaperas saying:
.'The majority of delegates were
ninstr-ucted by their chapters on
his issue as apparently the Grand
‘A ouncil was attempting to steam-
oller it through. Since then, it has
peen obvious that the delegates
‘id not voice the true sentiments
; f their chapters.”

VA To Crack Down
On Vet Class-Cutting

The Veterans Administration plans to crack down on class

If a vet expects to continue in the University, his attendance
record must be satisfactory, according to the VA.
Under this new plan, a school will be required to report ex-

The majority of the members did
believe, however, that something
should be done about untidy condi-
tions in the Commons Room.

In the discussion, some of the
women indicated that they felt the
Council was being used to avoid a
direct ruling which the deans of
men and women thought would be
hard to enforce-

This, according to a Commission
spokesman, was opposed to the
ideal of the women's organizations
to work for the students. WSGA mem-

ligence in doing this will make the
school responsible for paying the
overpayment for the services rend-
ered. \
. The VA expects to put this plan
into effect within a week.

The University asks all veterans
toabide by itito the best of their
ability. .

In the past, a veteran could fail
a course because of excessive cuts
and only fail in that particular class.
Npw, if he fails because of cuts, he
will be dropped from the school
entirely. T

At Pitt, a vet now gets a letter
after a reported class cut stating
that he is to stop in the dean of
men's office‘ and clarify the matter.

If he fails to do so, he receives
a second letter saying that he has
been dropped by the University and
his veteran benefits with the Vet-
erans Administration have been
interrupted.

A cut can be legalized only by
bringing in a signed excuse from
the veteran’s doctor.

A VA spokesman said that if a

Opposes Plan

Men's Council passed a motion
to oppose the setting up of rules
that will infringe on the students’
rights in the Commons Room at its
Thursday meeting. ‘

The Council passed one motion
that labeled the Commons Room
Council’s plan tocollect alllunches,
coats and books left on the chairs
and tables as an "infringement on
the privileges of the students "”in
the Commons Room and tabled an-
other motion that called for “vio-

move.

Lagnese Appointed

MC president Roy Titchworth ap-
pointed Joe Lagnese as head of the
committee to attend the -CRC exe-

and report back to Council.

Lagnese attended the meeting and
discovered that CRC was going
ahead with the clean-up plan with
or without the aid of Men's Council
and that the MC would have no vote
in the CRC executive meetings.

These facts aroused a storm of
comments from the council members
who called the project 3 P130 W

At its final session Upperclass
Court imposed its first sentence on
a freshman and at the same sitting
recommended that no Panther keys
be awarded to freshman this year.

The freshman, Jerry Milch, on
whom the sentence was imposed,
must make a 90 per cent or better
on the Customs Exam because he

- -had consistently forgotten his dink,

according to the Court.

Upperclass Court will present its
recommendation to the-Supreme
Court, a body made up of faculty
and student members, when it con-
venes at 3:30 p.m. this Friday, Nov.
17, in Stephen Foster Memorial.
It will decide which freshman will
get keys,and Upperclass Court will
present its case against the Fresh-‘

counsel for the freshman. All fresh-
manand their upperclasscounselors

{MC Store‘
Nets $403

The Men's Council Used Book-
store, despite competition from the
University Bookstore, shows a net
profit of $403.08,the largest amount
ever made.

However, Ronald D. Ecker, man-
ager of the Council store fears that
the University store, by buying and
selling used books during this
semester, may put his store out of
business by February.

Ecker says that the eighth floor
store’s sales were not affected too
much this term because the Univer-
sity bookstore did not have time
to accumulate a largeenough supply
of used books to give much compe-
tition.

Auto tags, which were also sold
at Council’s store, are now being
sold at the Student Desk. ’

The store’s profit goes to Men’s
Council and will help pay for the
proposed men's lounge on the
eighth floor.

The store will open again on
Feb. 3 or 4 only to take in used
books. At the start of next semester
the bookstore will both buy and
sell used books.

Watching and Waiting

Commons Room Council is now engaged in a drive to enlist
aid in cleaning up the Commons Room. We cannot at this moment
lend a hand. We are curious to see just what this sort of drive en-
tails. »

On the surface, and according to all of the details, it smacks
very much of a civic uplifting campaign such as one finds in
small towns. It is something like building a fine new public
school and at the same time cutting the salaries of the teachers
to pay for it, and restricting the enrollment.

As we understand it the Commons Room is primarily a place
for students to lounge between classes; a place where they can
meet and talk, and a place where they can study. This Commons
Room Council seems to want to make it a place that the garden
clubs of this city will admire for its austere and reverent silence,

and not a place where the student body can congregate.

If the drive is successful the Commons Room will be neat and
orderly and quiet. _There won’t be any books on the tables, nor
will there be coats hanging on the chairs. And there won’t be any
students in the Commons Room either.

And if the CRC is successful it will be much cheaper to loaf
in the Tuck Shops. Those ten cent fines are more than the price

of a cup of coffee.

Good Performance

The Varsity Marching Band,

as was expected, did credit both

to itself and to the school on Saturday. Its performance was all
that could be desired. We feel that the $2100 that students and
friends of the band invested in the trip was rep aid in full.

At the same time the team’

s performance was every bit as

good as the band’s. Against a football machine of long standing
the team came close to a victory. That it lost does not detract

from its splendid performance,

letic departmentwith transportation.

Connelly and his men devote
much of their spare time to obtain-
ing funds from the Eagle Aeries in
the/.,district and using the money to
bu ‘cigarettes, matches, and other
incidentals which they distribute
to the vets recuperating in the hos-
pitals in Aspinwall, Deshon, and
Altoona.

They also make minor repairs
around the hospital.

“We have two purposes in mind
about this project,” said Connelly.
“The first is to aid the veterans
and the second is to prove that the
Eagles are not a bunch of booze-
hounds as is commonly believed.”

"Many people distribute cig-
arettes and things to the men at
certain times of the year, but my
committee and I have learned that
there are certain periods when there
are fewdonations, so we tryto make
our distributions during the lean
months.”

Although Connelly’s work entails
a great deal of time and paper work,
he enjoys the job he is doing and
wishes that more people would con-
tribute to this effort.

In the matter of blood donors,

Connelly cited the fact that recently
the Eagles contributed 68 pints of
blood to the Wabash hospital.

He remarked that "It's a lot of
work rounding up the men and mak-
ing the arrangements but the satis-
faction obtained is well worth it.”

Connelly’s next project is spon-
soring a trip for a group from the
various Boy’s Clubs in the vicinity
to the Pitt-Michigan State game.
§The Eagles will also serve sand-
‘wiches and coffee to this group.

|Final Mixer
Open to All

The last mixer dance for this
semester will be held this Thursday
in 1217 C1. from 2:30 to S p.m.

This will be the second dance of
the season that is open to the entire
student body. The first four were
only open to freshman.

Past dances have shown that
more men attend than women. The
committee hopes that some more
women will attend this last dance.

Next semester there will be six
mixer dances open to the entire
school.

These mixers are sponsored by
WSGA, Men’s Council and Student
Congress.

"Sadie Hawkins”

Dance Scheduled

A Sadie Hawkins Dance will be
held by the 12th floor committee of-
WSGA tomorrow, Nov. 15, from 2:30
to 5 .p.m. on the 12th floor of the
Cathedral. The first dance of its
kind sponsored by WSGA, it will be
open to all Pitt women, regardless
of their class standing. The only
requirement for attendance is bring-
ing along an escort.

Besides dancing to musical re-
cordings provided by Jerry Newberg,
couples can drink “kickapoo joy
juice” and munch “pork nips” in
true Dogpatch fashion, according to
WSGA leaders. Special varieties of
Dogpatch corn stalks, as well as
Daisy Mae and Li’l Abner figures
will be used in the decorations.

and alumni journey soberly to Notre
Dame, observe the play with expert
perception, and meditate over the
performance with great concern.

After all, that was their pur-
pose in making the trip.

Spirited Activities?

It is true, admittedly, that the
troupe indulged in certain spirited
"activities which are not ordinarily
the mark of the cold, observant fan.
But these gestures were purely
in the interest of putting a little
ardor into the Panther cause.

Beer and hard liquor were speci-

ficially banned by train officials.

Consequently, large quantities of
milk were seen to be consumed from
numerous shirt sleeves. Everyone
was cooperating, for they came
along solely to see a football game,
youknow.

On a stroll down the aisle of any
coach in the train, one could see
male gridiron strategists demon-
strating various holds, and tackles
to the coeds.These,of course,were
educational sessions. After all,
the girls had to know what was
going on when they attended the
game the next afternoon.

Into Yogi Lead

Ted Geremsky, guest grid yogi,
who doubles as end and tackle
for the Panthers, used his 6-4
height to good advantage as he
squeezed the ratings for the root-
ball team into first place.

By correctly picking 10 out of
11 right (there was one tie), Tall
Ted inched into first place,
ahead of News leaders Stan
Skirboll and Myron Kopelman.

Skirboll also only missed one

modestly admitted to their lack of
football knowledge and sashayed
up the aisles in search nf a coach --
any coach would do. Happily, they’
found no trouble in picking up one.

‘Stepping off the train in South
Bend Saturday morning, our football
students jubilantly inhaled thecrisp
Indiana air."Good football weather,
by God!” they chorused. Stan Skir-
boll of this department walked four
blocks, and the rims of his glasses
cracked - but it was great football
weather.

More Milk

Many members of the party recog-
nized the fact that they had better
keep warm in order to be their best,
alert selves that afternoon, so they
partook of additional milk.

Thoroughly homogenized, they
spent the morning bouncing through
such spots as Woolworth’s Five and,
Ten, probably the livliest spot in
South Bend.

Then, having properly conserved
their energies, all the football
scholars retired to Notre Dame
Stadium, intent upon thescientific
study of our autumn pasttime.
