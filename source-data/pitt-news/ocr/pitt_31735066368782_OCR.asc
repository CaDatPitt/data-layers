Work on the addition of two
women’s locker rooms, the ﬁrst in a
series of renovation projects slated
for the Fitzgerald Field House, is
scheduled to begin by the middle of
next week. 1
According to iéiunt Martin, Pitt’s
director ' of facility planning,
Chancellor Posvar was expected to
give the project go-ahead sometime
yesterday. It would have ended a
short delay caused by budget
uncertainties.
The completion date, originally
scheduled for Nov. 15, has been

Martin said.

Architectual and budgetal dis-
crepencies forced the redesigning
of an overall project, Martin said.
Pitt athletic director Carl Myslinski
added that the renovations will now
progress in various stages until the
entire Field. _House has been
completed. .

After meeting with the architect,
the contractor, Myslinski and the
budget ofﬁce “to see exactly where
we stand,”Martin sent a recom-

PUC Sets Cost Ceiling on Coal

HARRISBURG—Coal from utility-owned mines would
‘have a cost ceiling tied to current market prices under a
proposal approved Thursday by the Public Utility

I . Commission.

The proposal, made by Commissioner Helen O’Bannon,

‘ would ease soaring costs for the coal that are now passed»

on to consumers. ,

Under the proposal, the price fora utility’s coal would be
determined by the lower of two monthly indicators: the
average price the utility has been paying for similar coal on
the market in a preceding three-month period; or the actual
cost the utility paid for its coal.

Police Find Lead in Moro Case

MILAN, Italy—-Anti—terror specialists, feeling closer than
ever to cracking the Aldo Moro case, are analyzing
documents and other material found in the apartment of a
captured fugitive suspected of being the mastermind of the
Red Brigades, police sources said yesterday.

" Authorities considered the arrest of 30-year-old Corrado
Alunni a major breakthrough after months of groping by
investigators trying to track down the Red Brigade terrorists
who kidnapped and murdered the former Italian premier
last spring. A

Minor terrorist violence erupted elsewhere just hours arter
Alunni was captured by police raiders Wednesday night at
his rented apartment in a Milan suburb.

Three men ﬁred pistol shotsvat the walls of the Nuove
prison in Turin. where Red Brigade suspects had been held
during their trials earlier this year. Also in Turin, arsonists

were reported in either incident.

R The police sources here said experts were digging into
“relevant” documents found in Alunni’s apartment,
looking forclues to the ultimate strategy of the Red Brigades

and possible past and future plans for terrorist attacks.

Scientists, Supermarkets Work    C I

To Resolve Sciccharin Puzzle

By The Associated Press

WASHINGTON — Although
Americans don’t hear much about
banning saccharin anymore, the
controversy has not ended with the
warning signs in supermarkets and
new labels on diet food.

‘the proposed ban on the artifi-
cial sweetener has only been
delayed, not lifted. (

And scientists throughout the
country are busy trying to rgesglye

the dilemma of what to do about i

the popular food additive, which
may cause cancer and for which

A there is no substitute.

In recent weeks, more studies
have been thrown into the
controversy, but none resolve the
issue.

In an exhaustive 700-page review
of every major saccharin study, Dr.

’ Morris F. Cranmer of the Food and

Drus Administation concluded that
better tests mustrbe done before
anyone can realistically determine
human cancer risk from the sweet-

ener. Because of the uncertainties,
he urged the government to move
cautiously on a ban.

A Johns Hopkins University
study comparing the lives of
bladder cnacer patients with a
similer group without the disease
found no cancer link with moderate
use of artiﬁcial sweeteners. A
similar Canadian study earlier said
it found, a positive association
between artiﬁcial sweeteners and
bladder cancer in males.

A survey of doctors and other

health professionals found that up

to 70 percent oppose a saccharin
ban becaue they feel that beneﬁts
may outweigh known risks and that
the data on saccharin is
inconclusive.

The National Academy of Sci-
ences, conducting a federally
funded study of the nation’s food
safety policy in general and
saccharin in particular, is review-
ing these results and much other

data.‘ The academy’s saccharin
ﬁndings will be sent to the FDA in.
November and the complete study
is to be ﬁnished by February, 1979.

The FDA tried to ban saccharin
last year, mostly because of , a
Canadian study linking large doses
of it to bladder cancer in male rats
and indications of a possible human
cancer link. . The ban was called for
under the Delaney clause, a law
requiring a ban on food additives
linked to cancer regardless
of other beneﬁts they may have.

A loud public outcry followed
because saccharin
general-use artiﬁcial sweetener ap-
proved for use in this country. A
debate ensued over the wisdom of
the Delanev clause in light of the
need for an artiﬁcial sweetener, not
just by casual dieters but by
diabetics or’ others for whom
obesity is a health problem.

with the 22,000-member transpor-
tation union, which Conrail inheri-
ted from its bankrupt predecessors.
Bargaining on a uniform contract is
continuing.

. In addition, the agreement places
into effect a wage and fringe benefit
package identical to one reached
last month between the National-
Railway Labor Conference and
the union.

According to the provisions of the
so-called crew-consist issue, every
time a train operates with a reduced
crew, each crew member will
receive a $4 allowance above
regular pay; Conrail also will
contribute to an employee produc-

tivity fund for each such crew V

operated.

L The reductions, which will begin
Nov. 1 and expand by attrition, do
not cover engine crews.
The crew-consist provisions allow
trains of up to 70 cars to operate
with one conductor and one
brakeman, instead of one conductor
and two brakemen.
Conrail now has 4,500 of its total

‘ 94,000 employees working as third

crewmen.
The agreement requires union

concurrence to reduce the crew for

trains with more than 70 cars.

Prosecuting
Ford for

 I Miscalculating
I - the Values of  

  People and
p Pintos

The indictment of Ford Motor Company by an
Elkhart, Ind., grand jury on charges of reckless .

homicide and criminal recklessness indicates the con-
tinuing concern in the United States'over corporate
social responsibility. In this case, the interests should
be even greaterthan usual, considering the crassness
Ford‘displayed in a confidential memo used as
evidence in one successful damage suit brought
against it after a Pinto with a defective gasoline tank
burst into flames. '

This memo computed the costs to society caused
by the deaths of 180 people predicted to be killed in
fiery Pinto ‘ crashes and the 180 expected to be
severely burned in accidents. The memo compared
this figure to theexpense of altering the substandard
Pinto fuel tanks. Ford engineers coldheartedly
decided the modifications were not “cost effective”
when they rﬁeasured the $49.5, million “societal cost”
against the $137 million price tag on -Pinto
modifications.

This inhuman craving for profits is the destructive
mentality government regulation of big business has
sought to control since the muckrakers, a group of
tur-n-of-the-century journalists, exposed rampant
fraud and unhealthy practices -in the meat packing,
drug, coal and textile industries. These writers’
passionate and sometimes sensational accounts for-
ced the federal government to reject the medieval
philosophy of caveat emptor and to begin to leash the
growing corporate giants through regulatory agen-
cies." ' _ , 
. These quasi-legislative .bodies have -progliferated

‘since the establishment of the Food and Drug Ad-

ministration in the early 1900s, but they have not
been perfectly successful in their attempts to restrain

corporate abuses. To often the-relationship between ‘E

the regulator and the regulated has become too
cozy—former agency officials often haven leap-

' — frogged into highly paid position ‘with companies on-

ce under their jurisdiction.

VWhile regulatory agencies‘ have spread, criminal
court cases such as the one against Ford have been
used as a control only sporadically. A landmark

“decision in this area occurred only recently when a

New Jersey court found corporate executives per-
sonally responsible for negligence in a case involving
several deaths and injuries after an empty chemical
tank under repair exploded.

*We hope the Indiana indictment marks a shift
toward use of -more criminal court cases to punish
corporations when they forget their first respon-
sibility is to produce a safe product, not to reap high
dividends for a small group of stockholders. This

-approach could be quite effective; company

executives might think twice before approving
products that have been proven dangerous-if they
know a jail sentence could be theirfinal reward.

Scheanley4Renovc.ztion,s Questioned

. Reading in The Pitt News, I see
that the University is ready to go
ahead _ with plans to renovate
Schenley~Hall at a cost of $6.5
million. I would agree that
Schenley Hall could be improved,
but when I see what the cost would
be to each student, I have'to doubt
the value of the project.

Each student would be charged
$10 a term to pay for the
renovations. This $10 becomes $15

in 10 years and then $20 in 20 '

years. And this $20 charge would
be continued into perpetuity.

A renovated Student Union
would certainly be nice, but at this
cost I would vote no—that is, if I
had a vote. Unfortunately, the
University has not seen fit to ask
the students if, at this price, they
want this project. ’ -

Of course, the Student Govern-
ment Board is in favor of it-—their
offices would be remodeled. SGB
member Dave Hesidence thinks the
students want this project. I
suspect they don't.

_ The only fair and honest way to
make this decision is either to
conduct a referendum on the’ issue
or, at least, conduct an impartial
survey of student opinion. In this
instance, the SGB cannot be
trusted (because of their vested
interest) to be the sole source of

V student input.

Anti  Somoza Rebels Beseige
No’riona|Gucird in Three Cities

By The Associated Press
MANAGUA, Nicaragua—Presi-
dent Anastasio Somoza, in a bloody
struggle to save his government,
mobilized national guard reserves
yesterday to throw into the ﬁght
against rebels in at least seven
Nicaraguan cities and towns.
_Three key cities in Nicaragua’s
populous northwest—Leon, Esteli
and Chinandega—remained in
rebel hands, their national guard
garrisons hemmed in by insurgents.
Somoza’s commanders were
trying to get reinforcements in to
relieve the beseiged troops, and
street ﬁghting was reported con-
tinuing in all three cities.
New rebel attacks were reported
against’ two towns—T)’1riamba, 20

 miles south of this capital city, and

Penas~Blancas, on the Costa Rica
border.

Econom i sis
By, The Associated Press
PHILADELPHIA——University of
Pennsylvania economists yesterday
predicted a “a very weak economy”
through 1980 but foresaw no
recession despite high inflation and
unemployment.
However, Dr. Lawrence R. Klein,
one of the three Penn professors‘
involved in the quarterly Wharton
Econometric Forecast, is convinced
that President Carter is going to
unveil soona much tougher, but still
voluntary, anti-inflation policy de-
signed to keep the lid on wage and
price increases. ‘
“Something’s coming,” said
Klein, who was Carter’s principal
economic adviser during his 1976
presidential campaign and whose
views reportedly are still welcome
at the White House.
“You can't ﬁght inﬂation uniuss

F!-L you’re tough. You have to make

enemies.”

Klein said he expects .1 new
Carter economic policy to be
unveiled this fall before the budget
message, adding, “The President
had better act now.

Sporadic street fighting was
reported continuing in two other
towns—Rivas, 80 miles south of
Managua, and Masaya, 18 miles to
the southeast, where guard troops
who won control of the town
Tuesday were mopping up rebel
stragglers. ’

Bodies were being burned in the
streets of some towns by Red Cross
workers, Associated Press news-
men in the countryside reported.

The casualty toll from the
anti-Somoza rebellion, in its sixth
day, ‘could, not‘ be determined
precisely. Red Cross officials
estimated at least 500 persons had
been killed and 1,000 wounded
since the pitched _battles erupted
Saturday.

The Nicaraguan war threatened
anew to involve other nations. P

The Wharton forecast, which
Klein prepared with hislcolleagues,
Drs. F. Gerald Adams and Richard
M. Young, points out a bit
ominously that “a substantial shock
might bring on a recession and, at a
minimum, would slow growth eve
more.”~ .-

Because of that threat, which
otherwise wasn’t identiﬁed in the
report, the three economists said

Carter wouldn’t sit by and wait for

something to happen.
“Solutions_ to the inflation
problem seem to beprestricted to
major and extended recession or a
long period of slow growth
supplemented by inducements to
increase productivity,” said the
forecasters.
“Which way

the ﬁscal and

monetary authorities will jump is a .

matter of substantial concern to all
of us.”

The Wharton forecast ﬁxed the
range of rising inﬂation at 7 to 8 per
cent. ‘ ‘

Even a large tax cut now being
considered by Congess, or moves

   

Lt. Col. Diego Landa Cerano,
defense minister in neighboring
Honduras, said other Central

‘American armies might go to

Somoza’s aid if the Nicaraguan
president asks for assistance under
the Central American «mutual
defense pact.

In Panama, about 1,500 people
were said to have enrolled in a
voluntary brigade that organizers
said would ﬁght against Somo2a’s
forces if he accepts outside help.

A national guard spokesman
claimed that three guerrilla attacks
in southern Nicaragua Tuesday and
Wednesday were launched from
Costa Rican territory and that some
of the guerrillas were foreigners,
but he did not say what nationality."

Somoza has accused Cuba of being .

behind the current uprising.

Expect Dismal Future  

to tighten the nation’s "money
supply, won‘t slow the inflationary

rate, the economists said.

outcome. . «

‘Henry, led by the dignified Mr.
Jordan (James Mason), sets out to
ﬁnd a new body for Joe’s soul. He
comes up with a millionaire named
Farnsworth, who has just been
poisoned by his _‘wife (Dyan
Cannon) and her lover‘ (Charles
Grodin).

Joe moves
body, andhere’ the trouble starts,
for although he now controls a vast
corporation, Joe is still a quarter-
back at ‘heart. Beatty skillfully
outlines the contrast in his

ations to rock studios and the

ofﬁces at “Rolling Stone” mag .
, azines to the American embassy in

China. .

The differences between
doonesbury and similar strips is
simply that Trudeau allows his cast
to develop and he has skillfully
and gradually maneuvered them
from the confines of insular
collegiated life to the outside
world.

If there is a featured characte in
Greatest Hits,” it’s onetime
runaway housewife Joanie Caucus,
who ﬁnally graduates from law

school. She gets a job working for -

an elderly congresswoman and

moves in with a Woodward/Red-'
ford-type reporter named Rick,

Redfern who lowers himself to
writing for “People” magazine to
be near Joanie until she graduates.’

Uncle Duke, demoted at “Rol-

ling Stone” to the “Gregg (Allman)

and Cher” bureau‘, accepts’-the
position of chief U.S. envoy to
China. Finally sent back home, he
returns to Aspen and proceeds to

-buy an ‘apricot fram to corner the

market in Laetrile.

It's impossible to describe the
book; the humor loses its purpose
in the description. But if you are a
Doonesbury’ ’ fan, ‘ ‘Greatest Hits”

’ is a must». If, however, you collect

the Doonesbury paperbacks and
your library includes “As The Kid
Goes for Broke” and “You’re
Never to Old For Nuts and
Berries,” the only thing you're
missing is a rather witty intro by
William F. Buckley. _

direction of the supporting cast.

V, Reactions to Fransworth’s sudden

personality change range from the‘
restrained amusement of Farns-
worth’s butler to the hyterics of
Farnsworth’s wife. 1

Julie Christie, playing an indig:
nant victim of one of Farnsworth’s
corporate projects,‘ adds a rather
chaste love interest, as she
artlessly falls_ in love with the very
man (or so she thinks) she came to
attack. ,.

The plot thickens as football
playoff season approaches, and Joe

' remembers Mr. Jordan’s ‘promise

that he still will have a chance to
play in the Super Bowl. Initially,
Joe tries to get Fransworth’s body
into shape by hiring his old Rams
coach (Jack Warden) to train him,
and eventually he buys the whole
Rams team. ‘ But ‘another fate
awaits the soul of Joe Pendleton.
On Super Bowl night, Farns-
worth’s wife succeeds in murdering
her’ husband. At the same time,

Jordan saves the day, and the

_ softened under

good Vsho'w.

“Heaven Can Wait’ ’ is a
romantic comedy of a.type not often

seen on a screen these days. The

absurdity of the situation, which
does provide much of the humor, is
Beatty’s hand,»
allowing the audience to empathize
with Joe’s frustration rather than

-merely laughing at his ridiculous

predicament. Joe could be any
man caught in a world where he
does not belong. '

Beatty and his co-author Elaine
May also do not hesitate to inject a

"bit of social comment into the

comedy. Joe’s.enthusiastic inno- .

cence as he invites the press into a
high-level corporate board meeting
and proceeds to upset all the dirty,

underhanded business policies .

leaves the audience both laughing
and wondering why a real-life

corporate executive couldn’t do the 1

same. .

The success of Beatty’s “ripoff”
can be attributed to a number of
factors. Good writing has done
more than slap a new coat of paint
on a rusty old car. May and Beatty.
have added 'new . facets to the
original script, expanding on the

simple theme to make it relevant.

The contrast between the lifestyles
of a quarterback and an eccentric
millionnaire serves to highlight
many absurdities of today's
society, while the storybook con-
ception of‘ heaven reminds us of
how complicated and confused the
idea of heaven has become.

Skillful direction prevents the
preposterous situation from devol~
Ving int!) mere slapstick. Beatty
and Henry aim for chuckles rather
than guffaws, letting the humor of
the plot evolve naturally rather
than imposing artiﬁcial sight gags
or one-liners. Joe’s speech to the
board, in which he tries to describe,
the workings of the corporation in
terms of a football game. plan, is a
perfect example. Naturally, a
quarterback would think in such
terms, but the board members’
puzzled faces bring laughs despite
the sincerity in Joe’s voice.

The care with which Beatty has
redesigned the original is what sets
“Heaven Can Wait” apart from the
"rest of the crop of summer ripoffs.
Where the others merely imitate,
“Heaven Can Wait” enhances and
expands. “Heaven Can Wait” is
one hot car that is worth buying.

   Fanner Pirate Steve Blass Named to Pitt Baseball Staff

ByKARENKADILAK

Steve Blass, a key member of the
1971 world champion Pittsburgh
Pirates, has joined Pitt’s baseball
team as a part-time pitching coach.

Blass, 36, assumed his duties
earlier this week and probably will
be at Trees Field Sunday, when Pitt

By ANNA ARLOTTA

‘V Pitt’s soccer team allowed a big
win to slip by Wednesday, falling
to the visiting Zips of Akron 3-2.

A ~ «_ ‘Akron opened up scoring early in

the game when striker Joe Perreirai
scored with only two minutes gone
in the ﬁrst half. Perreira dribbled
the ball from the left side to the
middle, where he shot it for the
score. “ -

then passed back to Nigh, who
went in for the ﬁnish. _

The Panthers found themselves
after Tissue took a Barry Stein pass
from the right side to score from 10
yards out. The Zips were shaken.

“Pitt threw us off with their
quick comeback,” said Akron
coach Bob Dowdy. “It really made
us relax. Fortunately, we were able
to gain our composure and win the
game.” .

hard, aggressive ball. Their efforts
were in vain, however,‘ and the
game ended with Akron ahead, 3-2.

Despite the loss, Pitt c9ach Leo
Bemis was pleased with the play of
his team.

“We played a good game of
soccer with good ball movement.
It’s just a shame that we played
that well and still came out a loser.
There was a lot of effort put forth to
earn our goals.”.

Dowdy agreed with Bemis.

“If Pitt plays all season how they
did tonight, I look for them to go a
long way and be successful.”

The Panthers will try to even.

Bemis. “They are very aggresive
and never give up.” '

Bethanygoes into its first game

Sherrill Still Mum, on Quarterbacks;  
Practice-weary Pitt Ready for Wave 

By BOB LABRIOLA

Pitt News Staff Writer

Even though there is -no national

championship to defend and the

opponent is Tulane instead of Notre
Dame, the'1978 Pitt Panthers will
not lack for optimism in the opener
tomorrow at the New Orleans
Superdome.

“I’m tired of practicing, and I
know the players feel the same
way,” said Sherrill. “I just want to
get out there and play.”

Sherrill insists the Panthers will
face a Tulane ‘team that is a
much improved version of the one
Pitt shut out, 48-0, last year at Pitt
Stadium.

‘ ‘Tulane is a different team when
they play in the Superdome,” said
Sherrill. “Last year, Tulane went
up to Rutgers and lost, 47-8, and
came back to the Superdome and
gave LSU a tough time the next
week.” The Green Wave lost to

the eventual Sun Bowl champions,"

20-17.

Forty-three lettermen; including
19 starters return from last year’s
3-8 squad that Tulane head coach
Larry Smith believes could just as
easily have been 7-4. The Green
Wave lost three games by 12'

-~ points, and, according to Smith,

Tulane-could have turned things

around if it had known how to win
close games.

Notre Dame transfer Willard
Browner will bolster a running.
game that has Tulane’s leading
rushers, Marvin Christian and Jeff
Jones returning. ' Christian, who
was not able to crack the starting
lineup until the fourth game,
ﬁnished the season with 691- yards,
while Jones added 339.

Quarterback Roch Hontas led the
nation in’ completion percentage
(63.1) last year and will rely on
receivers Alton Alexis and Darrel

Griffin to ﬁnd openings in the

secondary. Alexis averaged better
than 10 yards on 30 receptions in
1977- and has become Hontas’
favorite target.

Tulane’s offensive line yvill be
anchored by Gerald. Sheridan,
Percy Millet and Dee Methvin, all
of whom will be starting for the
third consecutive year. Millet will
be joined at guard by senior Paul
Nudrich, and senior Mark Montini
could land the ﬁnal starting spot if
his knee has healed after surgery in
‘the off-season. ‘

While the defensive personnel
remains largely unchanged, Smith
promises the Green Wave will be
more physical this season. In the
ﬁnal two preseason Scrimmages,

the defense scored as many
touchdowns (two) as the offense.

. “The defense has made the
offense better,” said Smith. “It
will show up in the fall, just watch.

I have. not been in a top program,

where the defense has not
dominated the preseason. That is
the way it should be.”_

Both Sherrill and offensive
coordinator Don Boyce have
expressed concern about how the
Panthers will handle Wilfred
Simon, Tulane’s sophomore middle
guard. Simon led the Green Wave
with 108 tackles last season,
including 20 against LSU and was
an Associated Press selection on
the All-South Independent team.

The heart of Tulane’s defense is
the linebacking corps, where Smith
will have the luxury of choosing the
starters from a group of six
lettermen. John Ammermann and
Jim Becnel were starters last year,
but by the start of fall practice,
both had been demoted to the
second team.

Frank Wills will handle the
punting chores, and junior place-
kicker Ed Murray has never missed
a ﬁeld goal inside the 41-yard line.

Pantherette Tennis
Set to Start  

By CINDY NATALI

A potentially strong Pitt
women’s tennis team tests its
strength in the 1 p.m. season
opener with visiting Lock Haven
tomorrow.

“They are really professional
looking, and they are really good
athletes,” coach Nancy Gordon
said of her players.
complete tennis team.”

Depth is the team’s main

‘strength, according to Gordon.

“If there was an injury, any one
of the first four women could play
No. 1,” she said.

The Pantherettes schedule has
been expanded to include chal-
lenges from Syracuse, Cincinnati
and Kentucky. Gordon believes
that despite the additional strong
competition, the team’s ability will
“blow some of these schools off the
court.” _

This year’s roster comprises 12
players. Half of the six starters are
newcomers: Randy Belkin, a
transfer from Monroeville; Lisa
Furra from Eric; and Donna Chorka
from Bethel Park. Returning
starters include Maria Paris, Janet
DeCostro and Jan Brownstein.

Jennifer Mullen and Lois Moses
add to the group of returning
players, while Aldene La Caria,
Lisa Weinberg, Annette Aloe and
Noreen Mazzocca begin~their first
seasons with Pitt.

Gordon sees improvement in all

\

   
 
    
     

“We have a '

of her returning starters. Paris has
changed her style, employing more

of a serveand volley game while

both Decostro and Brownstein
appear to be stronger.

Good conditioning has further
sharpened the team’s skills. The
women returned from the summer
layoff in good condition and are
following through with pre- and
post-practice workouts that include
running. '

“They worked in the summer,
and you can really tell,” said
Gordon.

Two of last year’s team members
will not be returning. Loss of
eligibility will keep No. 3 player
Pam Bachman off of the courts,
while No. -4 Jan Irwin has
graduated. Bachman, who would
have had two more years to
participate, was playing excep-
tionally well, according to Gordon.
' “They were two fine players,”
she said. “They were both a loss,
and they’ll be missed.” I

The team faces Lock Haven at .

the Greentree Racquet Club, the
Pantherettes’ temporary base until
resurfacing of the Pitt courts is,
completed Sept. 19.

Gordon ranks Lock Haven as the
second strongest team on Pitt's
schedule, after powerful Penn
State. .

“I’m always optimistic, but I
really expect a ‘good match from_

.. them,” she said.

COLUMBUS, 0h_io—A television ,

monitor may play a vital role
tomorrow in the Penn State-Ohio
State college football showdown.

Ohio State assistant coach Alex V

Gibbs concedes the television
helped him overcome rustiness as a
scout. Gibbs spied on the Nittany
Lions’ 26-10 victory over Rutgers
last week.

“I hadn’t done any live scouting
for five or six years by myself.
Trying to see both sides at once is
quite interesting,” said Gibbs.

Smith, an assistant to Bo

Schembechler for six years, began

. ‘his third season as Tulane coach
with a record of 5-17-0.

“From coach Schembechler, I
learned what emotion was;"’ said
Smith. “I also learned how to get a
team really tough, an aggressive
football team that plays good sound
football without mistakes.”

John Morris, Penn State’s sports
information director, provided
Gibbs with the TV monitor.

“With the TV, I could see
replays. It sure helped. I thanked
Morris afterward. I don’t think he
was too happy about it,” said the
Ohio State sleuth.

Gibbs, as an offensive coach,

around Bruce Clark. and Matt
Millen, a couple of tackles in the
260-pound range.

“They have two of the best
defensive linemen in the country on
the same team,” said Gibbs after
watching Clark and Millen stymie
the Rutgers’ attack for a 2-0 start.

The Buckeyes, No. 6 nationally,
are making their debut tomorrow.

“We’ve got to block" their line
pressure. To move the football,
you’ve_ got to control those big
linemen,” said Gibbs.

The Ohio State scout hinted that 1

Penn State’s only defensive weak-
ness may be in its backﬁeld.
“Their secondary is young-two
games young. Both opening
opponents Temple and Rutgers
tried to pass on them with
moderate success. They try not to
give up the big pass and wait for

their defensive line to get" you,” \

said Gibbs. ‘
Despite losses, ~.Temple and

Rutgers hit a combined 22 of 44‘

passes for 228 yeards.
Gary Tranquill, another Ohio

,. State assistant, said Penn State’s

attack has not changed much under
coach Joe Paterno.
“They still have great balance

between their rushing and" pass- '

ing,” he said.
Tranquil] labeled quarterback

4' Chuck Fusina of Penn State the

best passer the Buckeyes have seen

in their last 13 games.
“Somehow,” said Tranquill,

“we’ve got to control him, not give

him an‘ opportunity for 75 snaps. '

He can pick you apart. He reads
defenses well. Hehas the ability to
pass the ball_ in the defensive
seam.” ‘

Tranquil] expects Penn State, I
trying to snap a two-game losing —

streak to Ohio State before a
regional television audience, to
rush with the ball at_ theioutset.
“We’re.. going to have to stop
their running game,” he said.
“Paterno always w'ants.to run the

NEW’;  ORLEANS“ (AP)L-'-’i

Muhammad“ Ali‘ will‘ try to‘ become ‘
the first man to win the"
heavyweight. championship three
times tonight when he fights Leon
Spinks, an ex-Marine whose fists
could writethe end to the Ali Era.

“This will be my, last ﬁght,” Ali
has said. “I\can’t_gp much longer
even if I wanted to.”

But should the 36-year-old Ali
win, he could change his mind for
“one more” ﬁght. Ali has retired
before. '

A loss, however, probably would
make the scheduled 15-rounder in
the Superdome the last one in the
most spectacular career in sports
history. ‘ ‘ A ' I

“I will go down as the first man
to win the title three times,”.sfaid~

‘ Ali and it seemslthat much of the

public agrees. In fact, the‘ general

attitudesappears to be that ‘Ali is"

champion and Spinks is - the
challenger. Spinks is aware of this
feeling,'but says it doesn’t bother
him. 7

“The only difference in this fight
from the other one is that this time
I’m trying to keep it, not get it,”
said Spinks. “I ain’t predicting.
The best man wins.”

Spinks, a supposed “lamb” with

,just seven proﬁghts behind him, -
