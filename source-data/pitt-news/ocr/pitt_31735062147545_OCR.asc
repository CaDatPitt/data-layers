. Plans To Spread
‘Idea Of Change’

Week-End Public Affairs Institute
To Use Religious Approach
In Creating Better Order

 

‘‘It .was an _,Institute where the
quality of the leadership an‘d‘,the‘_en-
thusiasm of the delegates was superior
to anything we have had of its kind
at the University.”

Such was the opinion of William W.
Mendenhall, sec_retary of the YMCA
and general adviser to the co-chair-
men of the conference, Annabelle
Knupp, C36, and James Eichelberger,
C38, in reference to the United Young
Peoples Institute on Public Affairs
which met here over the last week-
end.

The conference was held to map
out a. new plan for social action
through a religious approach. As)
Miss Knupp remarked at the begin-
ning of the Institute, “Most confer-
_en,ce,s_.a_re4 just conferences. The dele-
gates discussiproblems, and everyone-
.goes away with a hazy notion of what
they have been talking about. This
year, we aim to not only have the
facts presented clearly, but we also
aim to have at the end of the Insti-
tute a summing up of all that we will
have discussed.”

One of the highlights of the confer-
ence was the Friday evening meeting,
when J. E. Sproul, national secretary
of the YMCA, and Roy Burkhart, pas-
tor of the First Community Church of
Columbus, Ohio, addressed the group.

“We aim to give ourselves a wide
view of theworld‘ in which we live—-
its good points and its bad,” Mr.
Sproul said. “We live in a world that
offers us a chance for growth, happi-
ness, and comfort. And yet, every-
thing is not right with the modern.-.
world, or there would be no depres-
sion, no wars, and no unhappiness.
Something is wrong with the modern
social order. The purpose of the In-
stitute is to ﬁnd out what we young
people can do about such a situation.”

Reverend Burkhart pointed out that
religion is a prominent factor in any
civilization, and should be outstanding
in regard‘ to anynew social order.»

“One of the points upon which all
religion rests is brotherhood and
love,” he commented. “In the com-
ing order, man’s personality will de-
pend entirely upon the contacts that
he makes with other people.”

“The chief purpose of religion is to
give hope and consolation,” he con-
cluded. “If the religion is not able to
do this, then it is not a working re-
ligion; it is worth nothing.”

Saturday morning and afternoon
were occupied by the work of the com-
missions on such subjects as peace,
marriage, war, philosophy of living,
and constructive home life.

Saturday evening was another high-
light of the conclave with a dinner,
round table discussion, and dance.
Leading the round table was Dr.
Bernard C. Clausen, pastor of the
First Baptist Church.

On Sunday morning, the ﬁnal meet-
ing was held in Webster Hall Hotel,
where the chairmen of the six com-
mittees presented the ﬁnal conclu-
sions reached by the groups. It was
found, in the words of Mr. Sproul,
that “we must educate the.people to
the idea of social change, and to the
idea that all is not well in the mod-
ern world. This is the most import-
ant factor in the work we can do to
create a new world.”

Doctors To Discuss
Pneumonia Problems

At its second meeting of the year,
Sigma Xi, honorary scientiﬁc frater-
nity, will present tonight a series of

.four lectures dealing with different

phases of research work in the study

rather well for themselves, charity,
and the Pittsburgh Press, in their
Buy-a-Paper-for-Charity drive Wed-
nesday.

According to Jerome Rosenblatt,
C36, chairman of the campaign,
the boys more than exceeded their
-quota of 400 copiesand collected
$27.50 for the Home for Crippled
Children. L .. "

Schultz Predicts
 Another Success

Val Ga.rvin’s Orchestra To Play
For “Little Milita.ry Ball”

Somehow or other, the law of sup-

ply and demand __will have to be modi-
ﬁeld, what with an this competition
among the Pitt Riﬂes, Dental lnterfra-
ternity Council, and Quax-Collembolae
dances on Friday the thirteenth. I

The Pitt Riﬂes affair, or “Little
Military Ball,” as Chairman D. C.
Schultz, BA38—he was head man of
the Soph Hop this year-——puts it, “will
far surpass the combined glories of all
the previous dances.”

The entire Pittsburgh Country Club
will be given over to the guests, who
will glide about to the music of Val
of INA Dance fame. And
then, at 12 o’c1ock,'a buffet supper-
“sumptuous,” says Schultz—wil1 be
served.

As an added attraction, the dance
will take time out for an induction
ceremony, during which the newly-
appointed cadet oﬂicers for the com-
ing year will beconimissioned.

The committee, which is not at all
unwilling to sell tickets at $2 a couple,
includes Frank Adams, C37 ; Jack
Vvithum, C38; Samuel Werlinich,
BA38; \Villiam McKenna, BA38; Rich-
ard Conti, BA38; and Martin Barrett,
BA37.

V Sergeant P. L. Duffy has given per-

‘mission to Advanced Corps men to

have the price of their tickets deduct-
ed from their January pay envelope.

Freshmen Sing
‘ We ’re In Money ’

The Freshman Dance Friday night
ran true to ﬁnancial form by clear-
ing, according to a conservative
estimate from Chairman John M.
Downie, C, “more than $150.” Be-
sides running to form, it established
itself as the most successful, ﬁnan-
cially, of all Freshman Dances in the
past three years and as the most
successful University dance this
year.

Three years ago, the same affair
cleared a little more than $39, un-
der Emil Meacham, not a student
here at present. Under Edwin
Beachler, C, it cleared about $30
two years ago. Last year, under J.
Neff Wells, C, it achieved the top
proﬁt of more than $80. This
year’s more than $150 holds recent
records. ,

Held at Hotel Schenley with Art
Giles’ Orchestra playing, the affair
featured novel programs and a
goodly number of freshmen, besides
the usual upperclass dancing
cliques. Tickets, at $2 a couple,
included breakfast at a downtown
restaurant, an idea established last
year under Wells.

Bickley Selected To Fill
Vacated Editorial Position

Recently appointed to ﬁll the edi-
torial chair of Dr. Dorothy Torreyson,
former instructor in Spanish at the
University, on the Bulletin of the
Pennsylvania State Modern Language
Association, is Dr. John R. Bickley,
instructor in modern languages at the
University. .

Dr. Bickley is also the Pittsburgh
representative for the Pittsburgh Mod-

Work Progresses, Additional Facilities

For Classes Take

Heretofore bleak, barren and un-
populated, the second and third ﬂoors
of the Cathedral will soon take on life
according to an announcement by J.
E. McLean, superintendent of build-
ing and grounds that temporary class-
rooms are being equipped on the bal.
cony ﬂoors.

This move has been necessitated by
the overcrowding of classes all over
the campus. Temporary ﬂooring is
now being installed which will lead
to the stairways, so that students will
be able to reach classes more easily.
Classes will be moved into the impro-

‘vised rooms as soon as they can be

completed and the ﬂooring ﬁnished.
Mr. McLean also announces that an

Form In Cat}: edral

oﬁice for the Chancellor is in the
process of being prepared on the
Belleﬁeld Avenue side of the ﬁrst ﬂoor
of the structure.

Partitions have also been set up
near the stairways, which will be
permanent features.

Work on the Stephen J. Foster
Memorial, temporarily stopped due to
the cold weather, is being resumed as
the weather permits. According to
present plans, the building will be
completed sometime next summer.

The other structure on the Cathe-
dral lawn, the Heinz Chapel, is com-
plete except for windows, woodwork,
and the spire. Work on the spire has
also been hindered by weather con-
ditions.

Social Workers’
Conferences End

 

Disregard For National Heritages
Scored At Monday Session

Too many _c_ollege/students with for-
eign backgrounds are, in their
eagerness to acquire a completely,
American way of life, allowing them-
selves to lose sight of their own na-
tional heritages, _says Miss Mary E.
Hurlbutt, of the New York School of
Social Work.

Children of foreign-born parents
should cease to be ashamed of or to
ignore traditions brought over from
another country, emphasized Miss
Hurlbutt at an informal reception in
the Cathedral Monday night, follow-
ing the ﬁrst two sessions of the three-
day institute on social workers’ prob-
lems being conducted under her lead-
ership at the University this week.

“Nobody,” points out Miss Hurlbutt,
“has ever been the worse off for know-
ing two languages or having two cul-
tures instead of one.”

Needs of the foreign born, nation-
ality factors in social case work, and
community programs with nationality
groups, have formed the main topics
of discussion at the two daily ses-
sions of the institute, which U1uoeS LU‘
day and has been attended by out-
standing organization leaders and so-
cial case workers of the western
Pennsylvania district.

Introducing Miss Hurlbutt at the
Monday meeting, Mrs. Ruth Crawford
Mitchell, chairman of the Nationality
Rooms Committee, showed how the
gathering together of representative
material to make up the nationality
rooms of the Cathedral is helping to
make Allegheny County foreign
groups conscious of the beauty of
their own national cultures.

Mrs. Mitchell headed the group of
young American social workers who,
on the invitation of the daughter of
Masaryk, president of Czechoslo-
vakia, traveled to the newly-formed re-
public in 1918 to institute primary so-
cial survey work in that country. Miss
Hurlbutt, who also formed one of that
group, founded the ﬁrst training
school for social workers in Prague,
afterwards becoming thoroughly ac-
quainted with other European coun-
tries in the capacity of world migra-
tion secretary of the YMCA.

Miss Hurlbutt is the third in a se-
ries of speakers being brought here
to conduct social work institutes un-
der the sponsorship of the Division of
Social Work of the University under
a Buhl Foundation grant.

The next of these forums, an-
nounces Dr. Manuel C. Elmer, head of
the sociology department and direc-
tor of the Division of Social Work,
will take place on January 12, with
Neva Dierdorf, expert on social re-
search work, leading the discussion.

Pan ther’s Christmas

zine for this year will feature car-
toon and comedy with a slight wink
to the jolly fellow in the red suit
and white fur.

dents who attend should be prepared
to voice questions concerning the or-
ganization.

Since its founding two years ago,
PBI has increased its membership un-
til it is now taking on the duty of ex-
pressing the general Business Admin-
istration student opinion, according
to Schriber.

All_cIasses in the School ‘will be dis-
missed during the third hour. If to-

da;y's .-meeting is _ a_de.q'u_at_ely » support-

ed by students, sessions of this sort
may be continued at regular intervals.

PBI will hold its second “bizad buz-
zer” of the year on Tuesday, Decem-

their last opportunity to hop and
prance and swing it _at a University
affair before the Christmas holidays

Inquiry Schedules
League Chairman

Lieberman Plans To Give Report
Of Unemployed Conference

Robert Lieberman, chairman of the
Allegheny County Unemployed Citi-
zens’ League, in his discussion before
Inquiry Forum at 12:30 o’clock today,
will include a report of the state-wide
conference of unemployed organiza-
tions held at Harrisburg last- week-
end.

The conference, which was com-
posed of representatives of the Unem-
ployed Citizens’ League, the VVorkers’
Alliance, the Pennsylvania Security
League,. and various ‘WPA project
workers’ unions, was presided over by
Harold J. Ruttenberg, C35, state or-
ganizer of the Pennsylvania Security
League.

As a member of the national execu-
tive board of the Workers’ Alliance,
Lieberman substituted for the na-
tional chairman of that same organ-
ization in the discussion of relief and
WPA problems. -  

“Mr. Lieberman,” according to
C36, co-chairman
of Inquiry, “was largely responsible
for the recognition by City Council of
the Unemployed Citizens’ League as
a representative of the unemployed in
relief questions. He helped build the
League to its present membership of
about 37,000 so that it is now affiliated
nationally with the Workers’ Alli-
ance.”

The speaker has been an active.
Socialist for 20 years and recently ran
for City Council on that ticket.

Former Instructor Leaves Economics
For Lions, Elephants, African Natives

 

By Chester Harris

Kalervo Oberg, former instructor in
economics at the University and at
present engaged in a research expedi-
tion in British Uganda, Africa, for the
Lond.on School of Economics and the
English Anthropological Society, is
spending what spare time he can ﬁnd
in big game hunting.

An excellent shot, Oberg has such
a record as a hunter among the na-
tives that he is known by them as “he
who never misses.” He already has
to his credit as a hunter many differ-
ent animals, among them several
lions. However, the feat of which he
is most proud is the slaying of an
elephant whose tusks are said to be
worth $250. Oberg, it is said, would
like the opportunity of hunting more
of these animals but British law for-
bids one person killing more than one
a year.

A graduate of the University of
British Columbia, Oberg continued his
work in economics here at the Uni-
versity, obtaining his MA degree i11
that subject. From Pittsburgh he.
went to the University of Chicago-,
where he became interested in-
anthropology under the tutelage of‘
Fay-Cooper Cole. Here he obtained?
hlS PhD degree in anthropology.

After his work in -Chicago, Oberg
spent the following winter in Alaska
studying the folklore of the various
Indian tribes in that region. During
that time, he and his wife were 30
miles away from the nearest trading
post and were forced to live, travel,
eat, and hunt in the same manner as
the primitives they were studying‘.

On the trip which he is making now,
Oberg expects to collect enough data
to form a complete cultural analysis
of some of the current primitives,

 The Cup Runneth Over

_ HAT TROPHY NVHICH the City Council set
T11p.3*ears ago as. a. football honor came very,‘
near to being a cup of woe for University au-
Atlioritiespover the past week-end. A couple of the
downtown papers took a running jump at the sit-
uation .and knocked over quite a few hurdles be-
fore they ﬁnally discovered they were on the
wrong track. ‘ ’ ’
\Vhile Duquesne University officials, to ‘whom’
alone-could concern over the problem be justified,
rested content in full understanding of the situa-
tion, the local sports folk found the spot very fer-.
tile for some snappy controversy. _

The upshot of it all resulted in a couple of
sparkling condemnations of University officials for
holding on to the cup and the rather inane state-
ment of one writer that the Pitt athletic office was
pulling this we’ll-keep-the-cup stunt as a. means of
stirring up some nicely divided sentiment and‘ not
without Mr. VV. Don Harrison having oneeye on
the. box ofﬁce for the Pitt.-Duquesne game next fall.
It may have been only coincidental that the writer
did.not advance this theory until Mr. Harrison
was half-way to California with the football team.

‘In plain language, the whole matter becomes
‘Simple enough. The inscription upon the cup do-
nated by the city decrees that “the cup is to be
contested for by the football teams of the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh and the Carnegie Institute of
Technology.” Mr. Harrison has asked the City
Council if it wishes to change that inscription to
include Duquesne, and has also suggested that Car-
negie Tech be consulted before the change is made.

Doubtless the council will, in the liglitof ~Du-
quesne’s rise to prominence, see ﬁt to make that
change. Meanwhile the University officials have
publicly recognized Duquesne as city champion,
and all that remains of the argument. is the pro-
verbial cocked hat. The hat, is appears, is being
worn at a rakish angle by the gentlemen of the
press who like to keep the sports kettle boiling.

Why More Battle?

THOSE OF COACH OLSON’S trackmen who

' have had their hearts set on winning a place
on the United States Olympic team to partici-
pate in the Games at Berlin next summer can go
right ahead with their training. What appeared
to be the most promising line of attack for the anti-
'pa_rticipationists fell before a small margin of votes
in the meeting of the National Amateur Athletic
Union concluded Sun-day.

" The boycottists, who in the carnival parlance hit
‘‘'pretty close, but no cigar,” plan to keep on with
their ﬁght. How long or where they are intend-
ing to go is more problematical than ever, and
-.inci‘tes to remark the question asked by Avery
Brundage, new presidentand sometime past pres-
ident of the group, “\Vhere are they getting the
money to spread all this propaganda‘.3”

Na turally, the AAU was very deﬁnite in passing
a‘ resolution that participation in the Games at
Berlin by the United States did by no means what-

-soever reﬂect our approval of conditions in Hitler-

ized Germany. The majority of the group found it.
possible to separate the Games and Hitler, which
"leaves no doubt of their conﬁdence that the
Games will be properly handled by the interna-
tional oﬁicials.

VVhat may be taken as some sort of a guide are
the words of Herr Maxie Schmeling, recently ar-
rived in this country. If Herr Maxie is picturing
the true situat.ion—and there is no reason to be-
lieve that he should not—he appeared to sound
the proper tone when he said all the Germans
realized that the American colored stars were going
to beat the German runners in the Olympic games
and that no one really cared very much whether
they did or not. as long as the G-ermanatliletes
made a creditable showing.

It was a pretty good ﬁght, and the only sour
note now comes with the announcement by the
group in favor of the boycott proposition that 
will do all in its power to prevent the raising of
funds for the team. This seems to be rather an odd
stand for those who so vociferously sought “fair
play,” and can be likened only to the fellow who
loses a race and then sets out to tear up the win-
ner's ribbons.

It now appears that the Detroit Tigers are no
longer the most. powerful nine in the nation. The
columns of publicity which the United States Su-
preme Court have been receiving as it starts :1 ire-
niemglously inmortant session appear to hand the

, judicial nine the title.

Among‘ the riddles we ’ll never hope to solve is
why so many applicants seek eagerly after NYA
jobs and then the University auditor has to beg
the workers to come and t.ake their checks off his
hands.

Civil Engineers Unburden Their Hearts

And Vocabularies In Printing Examination

By William Murray

Statements, aesthetic, practical,
cynical, and miscellaneous, were given
by future civil engineers to W. Irwin
Short, instructor in the department of
civil engineering, when he gave a trial
examination in lettering to his fresh-
man students.

The purpose of the test was to see
how the boys had progressed i11 the
free hand printing, and Mr. Short told
them to write anything they liked so
long a.s it pertained iodrawing.

‘The embryonic surveyors took him
at his word and wrote exactly what
they thought——not only of drawing,
but of the professors and the depart-
ment_as well.

“The only trouble with drawing,”
said one young man, “is that it takes
too much time for a two-credit
course.” _

“I am beginning to enjoy my week-
ly‘1ab periods now,”, wrote another,
obviously a inaniof few‘ words. “The
ﬁrst few weeks of it were tough.”

Technical Slang‘ ,
*,TalIcs. In Terms
. Of ?Big Money_’

‘By Ray Maclntyre

._He’s a .ta1l,,__lanky..fe1low.witl1 wavy
red "hair and a sleepy manner ‘about
him, and when he talks in his drawl-
mg‘ tone, ‘you somehow "get the im-
pression that he’s a man who can do
things. This impression becomes
clearer when he begins talking in
terms of dollars that run up into the
thousands-

“Pitt Players’ equipment, which is
stored up in the shop, is worth over
10,000 dollars,” he revealed to an in-
quisitive reporter who was trying to
get at the inner workings of the tech-
nical staff of the Players, and solve
some of the mysteries -which abound
inthe technical shop on the second
floor of the rambling red house be-
low the Stadium. -

“Lastyear we grossed over 1,000
dollars" on rental and outside con-
tracts for lighting, decorating, etc.
The year before last, we made over
700 dollars. We make far more
money than the business staff——in
fact. we often pull them out of the
red.”

The reporter, who was temporarily
dazzled by these sums, gulped and
asked, “Well.,.who gives you these
jobs, and who rents your equipment‘."’

“Our best customer last year was
the Pittsburgh Playhouse, which
rented our equipment for every sin-
gle show they put 011. Then, we had
jobs at Shadyside Presbyterian
Church, Greensburg High School and
Garrick High School. We took care
of the lighting effects at all Pitt
dances but four, the biggest of which
was the military ball.

“Where does the money go?” was

a rather impertinent question which

the tall young man answered imme-
diately.

“Every cent of it is ‘ploughed back’
into lights and other equipment. with
the exception of that which is spent
for keys. I keep my own accounts,
so I know.”

“This is certainly interesting,” re-
marked the reporter.” “Let’s see, your
name’s Jack Robson, isu’t it, and your
official position is ‘Chairman of Tech-
nical Staff’?”

“That’s right, and I graduate from
the School of Electrical E‘ngineering
next. June.”

“How ill the world will Pitt Players
get along without you?”

“Oh, they’ll ﬁnd somebody else, 1
guess.”

Mr. Short mentally pictured a shin-
ning apple being handed to him as he
read this one: “The University of
Pittsburgh oﬁers an excellent course,
modern in every respect. Chancellor
Bowman scoured the country in order
to, obtain the best instructors, men
inspired with the desire to teach. His
search was rewarded, and at the pres-
ent time, the civil engineering faculty
rates with the best in the country.”

Some of the answers showed a
frank insight into the characters of
their writers. “I am an awkward fel-
low by nature,” admitted one fellow
awkward by nature, “and it seems as
though all my ﬁngers become thumbs
the moment I pick up my drawing
pen.”

A second pessimist went even
further in denouncing himself. “My
letters look as if they were drawn
with my feet,” he moaned.

“Letter plates get in my hair,”
wrote a cynic, delving into the world
of abstractions.

Aesthetes, too, are not unknown in

Private Lives Of Lab
Specimens Bared
V-In Sub-Cellar’

Far from"the inadding ‘crowd of

students and prof_essor_s, _ in. a . secluded
corner of the ‘ Cathedra.l’s‘ sub-cellar,
is the zoology stock room.
_ Down where the Cathedral begins,
several students toil from day to day
with preserved frogs, dead sharks.
and amoebacultures.

These are the fellows, enabled to
work because of President Roosevelt's
National Youth Administration, who

handle and prepare the dead cats
that are used in the cat anatomy
classes.

Down there lie many glazed-clay
crooks containingdead crabs, mini-
aturesharks six feet long. . .

Lining the shelves are numerous jars
containing- eggs of many varieties of
amphibians. ,_ In several gold-ﬁsh
bowls, in the process of development,
are amoeba and paramecium eggs, and
tropical ﬁsh. To maintaiii thetropical
atmosphere, powerful, 100-watt light
bulbs are employed, and sea weed pro-
vides the added marine color.

In another section of the stockroom,
slides to use in illustrated lectures
are made and developed. In still an-
other section. mounted deer, moose,
and bear heads adorn the walls.
Equipped with all the necessities for
taxidermy, larger mammals are fre-
quently stuffed and mounted.

In addition to this work with ani-
mals, this stockroom crew also does

much of the routine work of the
zoology department, such as the
mimeographiiig work, and taking

custody of the department’s supplies.

While other students are engaged in
the more routine work of various de-
partments, these six students are con-
stantly breeding and feeding white
rats, to be used in experimental work.
Besides the characteristic smell of
_white_rats, the air is heavily ﬁlled
with the pungent odor of formalde-
hyde, the chemical substance used for
preserving the animals over a long
period of time.

terested are invited to attend.

 

Freshman Clubs Hear Talks
A if ByDr. Carlson, ‘Dad’ Elliott

 

“Athletics is one of the items ne-
cessary to our increasing leisure,”
averred Dr. H. C. Carlson, director of
the Student Health Service and has-
ketball coach at the University, as he
spoke before the Monday Freshman
Club.

Dr. Carlson discussed the history
of athletics from the Grecian age to
the present day. He traced the game
of football through the different
stages of its development. To illus-
trate the opposition to the game by
the academic-minded in its early
stages, the doctor related the story of
an eastern college president who re-
fused to allow the team of his school
to travel 100 miles “just to agitate a
bag of wind.” .

Before the VVorld War, according to

Dr. Carlson, the American men
thought that they were supermen.
However, the draft for the war

showed that 80 per cent had some
sort of defect. This resulted in an in-
creased program of athletics in the
years following the conclusion of the
great conflict.

The Student Health director stated
that there are two phases of athletics
today. The ﬁrst is physical ed11ca—
tion which is mostly corrective phy-
sical instruction. On this point, Dr.
Carlson opined that physical educa-
tion courses do not give enough ad-
‘vice on how to relax. The second
phase which he listed is the coach,
who is an agent of community health.

Turning to basketball, he mentioned
that it is the most universal game.
being played in 59 countries, and
thus is an agency for international
understanding. This year’s team at
the University. although inexperi-
enced. will come along, he predicted.
He discussed the interesting person-
nel of the team. and asserted that
this year, as always, he wants to “win
’em all.”

Last week, the Thursday Freshman
Club heard an address by A. J. Elliott,
former All-Western end of the North-
western University football team.
“Dad,” as ‘he is known to students,

spoke on the ‘subject of “Dynamic
Living.”

“There is one fact which college
students should keep constantly 'in
mind,” he said. “Students should
have kinetic energy instead of poten-
tial force; they must do things, in-
stead oftalking and arguing about
them. This is the whole secret of
dynamic living.”

1111'. Elliott compared certain types of
students to automobiles being hauled
intothe garage for repairs by a11 in-
signiﬁcant wrecking car that is
equipped with plenty of power and re-
serve. Some students look ﬁt to cope
with a situation that requires some
will a.nd brain power, but they allow
themselves to be pushedand shoved
around by people who have character-
istics like the wrecking car.”

He advised a form of laboratory
method for people who are in doubt
or up against a hard proposition.

“You don’t believe what somebody
tells you in your laboratory work.” he
said. “Instead, you test out what he
says, and if the experiment comes out
properly, then you take his word

. Trutli is not truth unless it is
tested.”

‘‘Dad’‘ was asked for his opinion of
Communism in regard to interesting
and dynamic living,

"None can deny the fact that Com-
munism has its share of good quali-
ties.“ he answered, but. in some of
its views on ways of living, Com-
munism comes into a lieadlong col-
lision with all principles of sane
reasoning. Communism does not
seem to be so concerned about certain
deﬁnite topics such as war. peace, and
brotherhood as it is about one deﬁnite
item, Communism.”

For to1norrow’s ﬁfth hour meeting.
the club will discuss Communism.
VVilliam VV. Mendenhall. executive
secretary of the YMCA and adviser to
the club. will present the essential
facts and features of the Communist
party. Three members of the club,
John Finkbeiner. C; James Kehew,
C; and Sam Williams, E, will take
part in the round table following
Me11denhall’s summary.

the surveying ﬁeld, as witness these
well-rounded opinions: “Smooth
curves and straight lines of every
kind satisfy my mind,” or, “1 was
taught the use of the French curve.”

The prize fan letter is this one,
which touched the professors deep-
ly:

“Drawing is tough. I spend more
time on it than any other subject.
And my schedule isn't easy either.
I have worked in the lab several times
until 9 o’clock. I often wonder how
CE profs can be so hard-hearted. Do
they soak their hearts in oil while
they sleep? On the ﬁrst four tries at
the ﬁrst plate, a ‘small’ mistake
brought on a ‘Doyou think you can
do better next time?’ from the ‘boss.’
It has given me an inferiority com-
plex so that I don’t believe I can turn
out an acceptable plate on- the ﬁrst
try. That’s what CE has done to me.”

Incidentally, Mr. Short has promised
to grade the papers only according to
the lettering, not to the boil mots
contained therein.

Clinic A Success
As Pitt Beats W& J

Frosh, Varsity Cagers Climax Sixth
Annual Affair With Victories

 

 

Dr. Carlson and his Panther cagers
took the usual spotlight occupied by
the footballers Saturday at the Sta-
dium, and altogether put on a show
that deserved a spot in the limelight.
It was the day of Carlson's sixth an-
nual cage clinic and the opening of
the local basketball season against
W&J, and-both wound up as expected,
a complete success.

The clinic, with a new attendance
mark of 3,500 spectators, was un-
doubtedly one of the best of the six
such clinics held. It ran an all-day
performance on all subjects of bas-
ketball, and gave the thousands of
scholastic cagers and coaches not a
little of Dr. Carlson's secrets of good
basketball. . ,

The varsity game, which saw 4,000
fans pack the Stadium pavilion, was a
ﬁtting climax to the day of basketball.
It was far from the usual sloppy sea-
son opener, and it took a great rally
by the Panther second team to ﬁnally
whip the plucky Wash-Jeff sopho-
mores, 41-35.

Miles Zelesnick and Joe Garcia,
with ten and nine points respectively,
led the Panther scoring, while Jean-
nette, with nine markers, and Laugh-
lin, with 11, were the aces of the
President’s attack.

The Panther freshman team made
the day a complete success by taking
the Little Prexies over, 33-22. It was
the ﬁrst loss in two years for the
W&J frosh. Fable, of Pitt, and Mc-
Cluskey, of the Presidents, led in the
scoring. "

around the greensward of Trees Field
or on_ the turf of Schenley, Oval. In
Nate Hepburn, ,S_ol _Menaker, Bill
Nickel and Al Duff are found the of-
fensive powers of the Interfraternity
tourney. _

Duff to Hepburn was the combina-
tion that clicked for almost every Del-
ta Tau Delta score.» In addition to
his pass’ throwing ability, Duff ‘was
always on,the, spot defensively and
was a big reason why‘ only one touch-

down was registered against the
Delts.
Perhaps the fastest man in the

Greek competition was Phi Ep’s track
satellite, Sol,Menaker. In returning
punts and dashing through an open
ﬁeld he was unequalled. Rounding out
the backﬁeld is Bill Nickel of Phi
Kappa. Like Menaker he, too, was a
triple-threat star, kicking, passing,
and running with unusual skill.

The two sensational stand-outs on
the championship Kappa Sig outﬁt
were Paul Mahoney and Marty Groat.
At the terminal post Mahoney per-
formed in real All-Greek style. De-
fensively and offensively he was with-
out a peer among the wingmen. It wa.s
he who caught the touchdown pass
which dethroned the Delts. Groat
played originally in the backﬁeld, but
his stellar play was worthy of a ﬁrst
team berth and since he was a ﬂeet
defensive player and a sure pass re-
ceiver we have placed him at end.

First team guard positions are
awarded to Bill Schenk of Phi Gam-
ma Delta and Cort Leigh of Phi Delta
Theta. Both were backﬁeld mem-
bers, but their superb blocking abili-
ties would make them ideal guards.

The pivotal duties were taken ca.re
of best by Irv Caplan of SAM, who
never made a bad pass, handled the
ball with dexterity; blocked with ef-
fectiveness, and earned the ﬁrst team
center position because of these
things together with his knowledge
of football tactics. .

Plenty of class is evident on the
second team. Bill Grosscope, of Phi
Delt., Don Andrews of Theta Chi, Bill
lV[cMunn of Kappa Sigma and Neff
\’Vells of Phi Delta Theta compose the
backﬁeld.

At ends are Jerry Mann of Lambda
Chi Alpha, and Delt Sam Ralston.
Guards are Sigma Chi’s Lou Woj-
chihovski and Kappa Sig’s Charles
Gollmar. Bob Prince of the Phi Delts
earns the second team center post.

Coach Schricker Talks,
Boxers Jab In Avalon

Yesterday before the students of
Avalon High School, Coach Jack
Schricker and ﬁve members of his
boxing team participated in a series
of demonstrations showing the science
in the hook and jab sport. The pro-
gram was given as a Sports Day As-
sembly.

Those men making the trip with
Schricker were John Stronko, Al Pas-
lowski, Abe Konick, Ralph Caruso,
and Henry Kaufmann. These men
have all shown improvement in prac-
tice.

Schricker is entering a few of his
men in the Metropolitan Club novice
bouts on Friday and Saturday. The
only requirement for entrance in
these bouts is that the entrant has
fought less than. six ﬁghts. Among
the expected entrants are Ralph
Caruso, Russ Vogel, Ed McAdams,
Steve Horton, Henry Kaufmann, John
Stronko, and Ray Tomarelli.

Practice sessions will continue
through the Christmas recess with
the following dates occupied by prac-
tices: December 19th, 20th, 21st, 23rd,
27th, 29th, 30th, and 31st; January 3rd
and 4.‘-.th.

Panther Gridmen
Practice 011 Coast

Locals Hope To Overcome Jinx
That Follows Coast Invasions

Trainer Bud Moore’s sun ray lamp
will be replaced by California sun-
shine today, for a spell at least, as
the Panther football squad indulges
in its ﬁrst workout on the coast in
preparation for the intersectional
clash with Southern California on Sat-
urday.

In the palm-tree surroundings of
the beautiful Lake Narconian Club,
with its golf course, swimming pool,
and tennis courts, Coach Sutherland
will attempt to iron out the ﬂaws in
the team’s work during the next three
days. .

Since the ﬁnal home game of th
year with Tech, the Panther practice
sessions have been anything but
smooth, cold weather hampering the
drills. Out on the coast with sunshine
replacing snow and rain, weather con-
ditions should be a help out no end
in getting ready for the encounter
with the Trojans. .

This trip across the continent
marksthe ﬁrst time since 1922 that a
Blue and Gold team has-hit the trans-
continental trail without any _Rose
Bowl worries. However, the Trojan
wor_ry will still be there as was the
case in the New Year’s game of 1930
and 1932, and both those worries are
very. painful to relate.

In 1930 -all that Uansa, Parkinson,
a11d the rest of the footballers could
show for a Rose Bowl battle‘ was .a
47-14 licking a.nd a good, suntan. Two
years later more bad news wascaused
by those pesky Trojans, who this time
administered a 35-0 shellacking.

Last season the Panthers gained
some measure of revenge. for both
thosesetbacks, by handing Coach
Howard Jones and the Trojans a 20-6

beating at the Stadium. Prior to
these. engagements with Southern
California, Pitt had met _Sta.nford’s

Indians a couple of times out on the
coast. ‘

In 1922 a regularly scheduled con-
test found the eastern representatives
topping Stanford, 22-7, but in a post-
season game in 1927, the Red team
nosed out Captain Gibby XVe1ch’s
club, 7-6.

Thus, the Panthers are in a good
spot to regainsome of the prestige
lost in the 1930 and 1932 games, by
giving the Trojans a good dose of
Eastern hospitality. The Jones-

coached -outﬁt has l1a.d a rocky season

this year, and a victory over Pitt
would help the Trojan followers a
great deal.

In their last three games, the west-
erners have exhibited their best form‘,
although losingtwo out of those three
games. The war horse triumphed
over VVashington State, 20-10, lost a.
20-13 contest to Notre Dame, and last
Saturday was set back by Washing-
ton, 6-2. Stanford was very fortunate
to bea.t the Trojans, scoring a 3-0 vic-
tory earlier in the season.

The Trojans are in a spot similar
to Carnegie Tech’s position in the
Thanksgiving game. »

Little Panther Eieven Gathers Momentum
As Season Moves To Successful Close

Coach Milligan’s Outﬁt W/ins
Three Straight After
Losing First Two

By Harold W. Byers,

VVith a record of three victories
against two defeats, Mike Milligan
closed his ﬁrst year as freshman foot-
ball coach with what may be termed a
successful season.

Though the team was slow in round-
ing into its winning stride, it gained
momentum as the season progressed
and was clicking in true form as the
season ended. , . -7

The Little Panthers opened the sea.-
son at the ‘Tech Bowl against Tom
Davies’ powerful Plebe team, which
went through the season undefeated
and unscored upon. Both "teams play-
ed a defensive game of ball due to the
muddy _ condition of.the ﬁeld. ’The
game was a punting duel, until late _in
the. second quarter, when Tech re-
covered a Pitt fumble on_ the Pan-
ther '32-yard line. Then on _a pass
Tech took the ball to the 15-yiardfline;
After trying -the line twice. for no
gain, J‘ack"‘Whitey” Lee went back
to the 20-yard line and kicked a ﬁeld
goal. _ .

Lose Out To Kiski

In the second half, Coach Mike
Milligan’s proteges threatened to score’
twice, but a fumble on the 17-yard
line ended one threat and an inter-
cepted pass on the 12-yard line pre-
vented the other scoring chance. The
gameended with Tech on the long
end, 3-0.

The next game found» the Little
Panthers at Saltsburg. The‘ yearlings
scored soon after- the opening kick-
off, when Marshall Goldberg, ﬂashy
frosh halfback, raced- off-tackle and
twisted his way 65 yards to the‘-goal-
line.

Kiski came right back and pushed
the tying marker across in ‘the sec-
ond quarter, when'Radman-, Kiski half-
back, ran around end for the score.-

The "game see-‘sawed back and forth
until the fourth quarter when Pitt
fumbled and Kiski took advantage of
the break. Skemp, Kiski fullback, did
most of the ball carrying for the prep
schools boys as they marched 58 yards
to the goal-line, where Skemp scored
the winning touchdown. The game
ended with Kiski out in front by a
12-6 score.

When the frosh boarded the bus for.

State college, 26 yearlings were de-
termined to break into the winning
column. Their. desires, were reward-
ed,‘as the Little Panthers slashed
their way to a 6-0 win over a strong
Penn State frosh team. It was a stub-
born ﬁght, with neither team giving
much ground until the middle of the
last quarter.

With Chickerneo, Goldberg, and
Shea doing most of the ball-lugging
duties, the Little Panthers marched
50 yards to a touchdown. as John
Chickerneo battered the line for the
only score of the game.

Following their initial win of the
season, the Little Panthers showed
the West Virginia frosh plenty of ﬁre-
works on Armistice day to return with
a hard earned 18-0 win under their
belt. The yearlings marched the
opening kickoff back for a touchdown,
with Hal Stebbins smashing oﬁ-tackle
for the ﬁrst score. The frosh penetrat-
ed the Little Mountaineers goal-line
for two more touchdowns. Later in
the game Goldberg faded back and
tossed apass to Bill Daddio, who rac-
ed the remaining 10 yards for the
second score. In the fourth period,
Clem Camba1,,hard-running fullback,
thrilled the large holiday crowd. “at
Connellsville with a_ beautiful 48-yard
run, for the third and ﬁnal score of
the ,day.; ,

Next the freshman eleven traveled
to Annapolis, and took on the Navy
“B” team in its ﬁnal game of the sea-
son on Thanksgiving Day. Once more
the frosh powerhouse began to roll,
and when the game was, overland the
dust had cleared, the Pitt eleven had
trampled the Navy “B” team, 3°-7.
Marshall Goldberg ﬁnished up his
freshman career by scoring twice,
while Clem Cambal, Bill Daddio, and
John‘ Chickerneo had found the goal-
line'for one touchdown apiece, with
Hal Stebbins making two extra
points. " '

The players who helped-make the
freshman season a success were:

Prepares Plans

Friday Contest To Feature Class
Group Singing, Original Skits

“We, the women of the freshman,
sophomore, junior and senior classes
of the University of Pittsburgh do
hereby declare the hour 12:30 to
1:30 o’clock, Friday the 13th, as the
hour of active participation in the
lnterclass Sing to be held in the
Heinz House.”

This annual proclamation has been
issued and all classes will be ready
for participation in the traditional In-
terclass Sing to be held at Heinz
House, on Friday.

Yearly, the classes arrange musical
skits consisting of songs with orig-
inal words and, sometimes, with orig-
inal tunes. These skits are presented
before a jury of 13 judges, which
awards a bronze loving cup to the
class doing the best harmonizing and
presenting the most original skits.

The class which wins the cup three
years in succession is permitted to
keep it. Last year the freshman
women came out the winners for the
first time.

The committee for the Sing is com-
posed of the three class presidents
and their respective Sing chairmen.
They are: seniors, Margaret Speer,
Ed, and Ruth Sochatoff, C; Kathryn
Hardy, C, and Betty Bryson_,_C, ju-
niors; Janet Hal1ock,‘C, and‘ Juniata
Steele, C, sophomores; and Mosse
Lingheim, C, freshman class represen-
tative, who is being assisted by Vir-
ginia Long, C36, as adviser of the
Glee Club unit.

On this same Friday, women from
the Johnstown Center will be enter-
tained -on campus.

committee, is a general activities ﬁle
containing the following information:

1. Name, class, and school of
each woman.

2. Number of activity points
she has carried each year.

3. A list of contacts which the
committee, the office of the
dean of women, or any com-
mittee chairman have had
with women not in activities
in a11 attempt to stimulate
their interest in extra-curricu-
lar work.

The activities committee has al-
ready started to place women in or-
ganizations, and any woman wishing
to do this kind of work should contact
either Miss Brice or any member of
her committee.

Members of the committee include:
Miss Brice; Grace Quil, C37; Phyllis

Daily Consumption 0fFoocl

 

By ldella R. Rome

Eight University students equipped
with shopping bags containing scales,
tin cups, and tape measures have
been spending their extra hours the
last two weeks interviewing house-
wives and questioning them concern-
ing the supply of food in the home.

The students, working for the Na-
tional Youth Administration, are mak-
ing a survey of the food consumption
of wage earners and low-salaried
workers in the city. This survey is
conducted by the Bureau of Labor
Statistics, United States Department
of Agriculture, and the Bureau of
Home Economics for the purpose of
securing data on quantity and cost of
food purchased and consumed.

Miss Pauline Skoblow, who is" in
charge of the survey, was sent from
the Bureau of Labor Statistics at
Washington, D. C. She is a Hunter
College graduate.

If a family agrees to cooperate in
the project, the student makes a com-
plete inventory of the amount of food
in the home. Every can, jar, box, pot,
and pan containing food is weighed

and the price recorded.

For a week the ﬁeld worker returns
each day to weigh and price the sup-
ply of food in the home. On the last
day another inventory of food supply
is taken. ,

'l‘l1e housewife is also asked to keep
edible and inedible waste in brown
paper bags until the student returns
to measure it. Left over meat and
potatoes from the plate are classified
as edible wa.ste. Egg shells, potato
peelings, grapefruit rinds and orange
skins are considered inedible.

These data will be used by the Bu-
reau of Labor Statistics in determin-
ing the food prices to be included in
an index of the cost of living. The
Bureau of Home Economics will evalu-
ate the nutritional adequacy and
economy of the diets.

The families from whom records
are to.be obtained areselected by lot
from those who have given informa-
tion on consumption ‘of"othe’r goods
and on disbursements, and also those
who have expressed a. willingness to
cooperate.

University students, who worked on
the project were: Jeanette Rosen-
thal, C38; Margaret Kranack, C38;
Frances Morton, C38; ldella Rome,
C38; Daniel Mosenson, Ph38; Stan-
ley J. Ambrose, C39 ; Paul L. Swoger,
M39; Robert Gray, C39.
