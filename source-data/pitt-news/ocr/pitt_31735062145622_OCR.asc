Panther _(_}_r_idders Bar Duke Claims To National Football

“Climbin’ Dem Golden Stairs!”

Night Riders Challenge Panthers
For City Football Supremacy In
Armistice Day Clash At Stadium

Golden Cats Are Primed
For Duke Invasion
Tomorrow

 

By Robert E. Badger

Pitt News Sports Editor
Tomorrow afternoon at the Pitt
Stadium the Galloping Ghosts of Du-
quesne university challenge the city
football supremacy of Pitt’s Golden

Panthers.

The Panthers are ready. Ever)’
man on the squad is in good physical
condition and primed to the hilt for
tomorrow’s game. There is no such
thing as over-conﬁdence in the Golden
Cat camp, for Coach Jock Sutherland
and his assistants, realizing that the
Dukes have the strongest team in
their history and one of the strongest
in the district, have instilled in their
players a wholesome respect for the
football ability of the Blufﬁites.

Coach Elmer Layden has had no
trouble in arousing his players. Each
and every one of them knows that
this is Duquesne’s big opD0I‘t11I11tY-
The Dukes tomorrow will have that
old “do or die for dear old Rutgers"
spirit. _

The Pitt lineup with one exception
is set, Both Nick Kliskey, the Blonde
Thunderbolt, who was injured in the
Navy game and George (Iron Man)
Shotwell are ready to go at the cen-
ter post. It is likely that S_h0tWe11
will start, with Kliskey going into the
game later and playing at least half
of the game time, Skladany and
Rooker will be at the ends for the
Panthers, Walton and Meredith at the
tackles, Onder and Hartwig at the
guards, Shotwell at center, Miinjas at
quarterback, O’Del1 and Sebastian at
the halves, and Weinstock at full-
"back. Matesic, Ormiston, Hogan, and
about 30 other players should see
plenty of action if this wr_iter’s DP?"
diction of 30 points (made in an arti-
cle for the Duquesne Duke) should
come true.

The Dukes tomorrow will in all
probability rely chieﬂy on the running
of Art Strutt and Toots Fillingham,
the punting of Zaninelli, and. the
passing of De Luca. In Zaninelli
they have one of the best punters in
the district, and in De Luca 0118 Of
the most accurate passers. The
Panther secondary will have to be
on its toes for the Dukes are sure to
throw plenty of P35895-

Although Coach Sutherland has as
yet made no announcement of his se-
lection for captain in tomorrow’s
game, Sebastian will in all probability
receive the appointment.

The game should draw a crowd of
at least 50,000. It starts at 2 o’clocK.

Nominees for offices of the fresh-

This new system of selection was
used in the attempt to make the
process of selecting officers more
democratic. Each of the mentor

divided, elected a representative to‘

By all time—hallowed rules of the
prediction fraternity, I should spend
the contents of this paragraph in
apologizing and appending my pre-
vious statements with a host of “ifs”
and “buts.” Believe it or not, none
of the usual excuses will be forthcom-

ing. I, for one,_refuse to sell Jock
Sutherland and the Pitt Panthers
“short.”

Let’s tone down a bit and try to
give a reason for the prediction. First
of all, the schedules of the respective
teams. The Dukes have met and de-
feated Waynesburg, Westminster,
Western Maryland, Detroit, Bucknell,
West Virginia, West Virginia Wes-
leyan and W. & J. The Panthers have
tussled with W. & J., West Virginia,
Navy, Minnesota, Notre Dame and
Centre. The record of the Dukes,
eight victories and no defeats, is much
better than the Panthers’ ﬁve vic-
tories and one defeat. So what? Both

teams have played West Virginia and
W. & J. The Panthers bettered the
Dukes on the Mountaineer tussle and
the Dukes retaliated on the Presi-

carried back t° their g’°“pS rep°rtS"dent’s. So what? Absolutely nothing.

when the ﬁnal election will take place.
The election terminates the work of
mentor groups.

Frieda Goldstein, C35, chairman of
the organization committee of WS-GA,
who conducted the meeting, considers
the new plan successful, because of
the enthusiastic and lively reception
by freshman women.

The nominees are: president,~Mar-
cella Layton, Dorothy Holbrook, Jean
Hamilton, Alice Lewis; vice presi-
dent, Dorothy Schwartz, Katherine
Hardy, Jane ‘Critchlow, Helen Sny-

E.N. Montague To Lead
NRA Discussion Tuesday

 

The third of a series of discussions
on the NRA, sponsored by the YWCA,
will take place next Tuesday after-
noon at Heinz House at 3:30 o'clock.
It will take the form of a panel dis-
cussion on the question, “Is NRA
Bringing Back Prosperity?”
be led by E. N. Montague, assistant
professor of industrial research, who
will be assisted by Dr, C. R, Daugher-
ty, assistant professor of economics.

At the second meeting, which took
place last Tuesday, the students
heard Dr. Francis Tyson, of the eco-
nomics department, speak on the sub-
-ject, “Does the NRA Encourage Class
Lines?”

These meetings have been arranged
by the economic relations committee
of the YWCA, and are to pave the
way to Industrial Day on November
23. The members of the committee
are: Rebecca Hirsh, Ed35, Betty
Glass, C36, Mary Desmone, -C35, Jo-
sephine Cannistra, Ed35, Jean Hutch-
man, C35, Sarah Cohen, Ed34, and
Alice Roth, C34.

The Pitt line is far superior (unless
they begin to believe it themselves)
to the seven men that Layden has to
offer. I look for Skladany, Timmons,
Rooker, Sites and the rest of the
ends to have a ﬁeld day. The rest of
the line? What’s the matter with
Kliskey, Shotwell, Hartwig, Onder,
VValton, Love, Meredith and the re-
serves? No, I'm not forgetting the
Dukes. It is possible that the

Explains To Inquiry Members
Russia’s Stand On War

“Russia is not headed for war!”
Ethan Colton, authority on Soviet
Russia and author of “The XYZ of
Communism,” reassured the students
at the Inquiry forum Wednesday.
“But it is laying a. militaristic founda-
tion exceeded by no other country in
the world and will be prepared,” he
added.

Mr, Colton explained to the stu-
dents that the Russian youth regard
their army as an international organ-
ization that will be used to aid com-
munists once they gain control in any
nation.

It was Foch, said Colton, who had
pointed to the Polish corridor ex-
claiming, “There lies the cause of the
next war.”

These were the impressions Mr.
Colton gave the students to think
about, “But after all,” he concluded,
“since the leaders able to act will not
budge from their present stand, why
not let the communists take over the
continent and see what they can do
with it?"

Take it or leave it. Paste it on the lockers or disregard it. Say
what you want, when you want to, but I still pick the Panthers to
wipe out Duquesne’s claim to the city and national honors.

Perhaps I am making a big mistake by coming out with a
statement that sounds. so preposterous on the surface. Perhaps I am
letting myself open to the ridicule that will certaliﬂy materialize in
Perhaps I shouldn’t be allowed to write a

 

column, but I’ll stand by my predic-¢

weights of the opposing lines may be
equal for tomorrow’s battle, and it is
well known that any line that has
worked together through eight games
must know something about the game.
The Dukes have “been played” up as
a mighty ﬁne defensive team, but I
think they’Ve bit off more than even
their supporters can chew. And be-
lieve me, that’s biting_

The respective backﬁelds are an-
other matter. The Dukes claim a “bal-
ance of power” with Strutt, Cutrona,
DeLuca and Zaniiielli as the starting
quartet. Against this talent the poor
Panthers must pick a starting back-
ﬁeld from a nervous and untried
group, consisting of Hogan, Munjas,
Weinstock, Weisenbaugh, Matesic,
Nicksick, Randour, Shedlosky and a
few others. Time out for Panther
supporters to break down and cry.

At least six groups of.people may
not agree with me. In fact the agree-
ment may take the form of violence,
I hope. These groups are, in order,
the Pitt coaching staff, the Duke
coaching staff, the Pitt team, the
Duke team, the Pitt supporters and
the Duke sup-porters. Maybe all six
of these groups are right. Take your
pick. There's two good teams and
two excellent coaching staffs to
choose from.

I hope the Pitt team reads this and
forgets about it. I hope the Duke
coaches paste it in their dressing
rooms. I hope some one complains
to the authorities. I hope its a clear,
cool day. I hope I’m right.

It’s A Bet!  

Editorials Cost Nothing,
So Editors Wager;
It’s Depression

 

The Pitt News will print new
editorials if the Golden Cats win
tomorrow, and if they don’t——the
editor will sit up in the Cathedral
ofﬁces till the wee hours of the
morning writing editorials for the
Duquesne Duke.

Such is the outlook today fol-
lowing the acceptance by the
Pitt News editor-in-chief of a
wager by Edward J. Waldman,
Jr., editor-in-chief of the Du-
quesne Duke. The letter from
the Duke editor follows:

DUQUESNE DUKE
Duquesne University,
Pittsburgh, Pa,
Editor-in-Chief, The Pitt News,
University of Pittsburgh.
Dear editor and friend:

It has occurred to me that a
friendly wager on the outcome of
the Duquesne-Pitt game would be
apropos. As gentlemen of the
“fourth estate,” we are of neces-
sity bound by certain limitations
not infrequently ascribed to the
professions. With this thought
in mind I have reached the con-
clusion that the ordinary medium
of speculation would appear
rather crude, mutually unbecom-
ing and perchance embarrassing
under present day conditions. So
let me suggest we stipulate as
basis for payment of our wager
a product of the pen.

Assuming you are in accord, ac-
cept my oﬁer to write each week
until Thanksgiving, an editorial
for The Pitt News if, after the
Armistice Day game, the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh team is de-
clared winner; you, of course,
are to be bound to The Duke by
similar conditions if the Du-
quesne university team prevails.

It is my hope and that of all
Duquesne students -as well, that
this game will further strengthen
our bond of friendship and clean
rivalry. With each succeeding
year there is bound to grow even
stronger the ideal intercollegiate
relationship already existing be-
tween these outstanding institu-
tions of learning.

Very sincerely yours,
(Signed) Edward J. Vvaldnian, Jr.,
Editor-in-Chief.

Zaninelli, DeLuca And
Strutt Main Factors
In Duke Attack

By Frank l'_.izik
Sports Editor, Duquesne Duke

Tomorrow is the red letter day on
Duquesne university’s football calen-
dar, for it is the day when Elmer Lay-
den’s Durable Dukes tangle with Jock
Sutherland’s Mighty Panthers at the
Stadium. Whether or not this game
is regarded as the top of the ladder
for the Hilltop Institution is a mat-
ter of personal opinion. But it does
mark a milestone in Duke football
progress since the coming of Elmer
Layden seven years ago. The Dukes
have marched steadily forward and
now they have a team that is able to
hold its own against teams of ﬁrst
rank.

Last year the great Panther eleven
whipped the Dukes very handily and
will be slight favorites to repeat, but
the current edition of the Red and
Blue is a much smoother and stronger
unit than its predecessor and there is
not likely to be a repetition of the
1932 score, In fact, local fans who
watched W. & J. hold Pitt scoreless
for 56 minutes of play in their in-
augural here this fall, and later wit-
nessed the decisive manner in which
the Dukes trounced those same
Prexies, realize that the Laydenmen
have the stuff to give the Panthers a
lively afternoon.

The rivalry between the two teams
will be intense. The Dukes, with the
greatest team in their history, have
already run their string of victories
to eight straight and will be out there
on Saturday to add the Panthers to
their long list of victims and thus
prove their right to stand up against
teams which enjoy national promi-
nence. Pitt, on the other hand, which
in the last ten years under (loath
Sutherland’s regime has suffered but
two defeats in the month of Novem-
ber, will be out to stop the galloping
Dukes from putting another dent into
that precious record.

The particular interest, however, in
this crucial fray will be centered on
the rival lines. Both are unusually
strong and are ranked among the
strongest in the East. Joe Bach and
Jock Sutherland both have been great
liuesmen in their college days and it
is only natural that they have in-
stilled their proteges which the same
power and defensive skill that was so
characteristic of the great teams on
which they played. The Red and
Blue forward wall, in all its eight:
contests to date, has never failed:
seriously_
opponents minimum of ﬁrst’

toa

downs and played havoc with every»
thing that the opposition had to of-
Of:

fer in the way of an offense.
course, the same can be said about:
Jock Suther1and’s powerful line, fon-
any frontier that can halt the charges
of such teams as Notre Dame and
Navy, certainly deserves Worthy con-
sideration.

The fans will likewise get a chance
to compare the smooth-functioning
backﬁelds of the rival teams. In
Sebastian, O’Dell, Hogan and Wein-
stock, the Panthers boast a quartet of
backs that are apt to trouble most
any team in the country. Sebastian
and O—’Dell already have been men-
tioned as potential candidates for All-
American honors, The Dukes, on the
other hand, have no players of All-
American calibre, but they do have
an assortment of ball carriers who
play well and are a dangerous lot
everytime they get their hands on
that ball. In De Luca, Strutt and
Zaninelli, the Dukes possess a trio
of backs that are especially noted for
their versatility. They can kick, pass,
receive, block and run with that ball
like the Immortal Four Horsemen of
which their Grand Master was a mem-
ber. I know that many of my gentle
readers will ridicule my last state-
ment, but what you have seen or
heard thus far about this year’s Du-
quesne outﬁt has been but a prevuo
to what you will see of the Dukes on
Saturday. That will be their climax.

Relations Gi'oup
To Retain Power

Council Rejects Move Curbing
Committee Charter Vote

By Israel L, Goldberg
Pitt ‘News Council Writer

Student Council, in a special meet-
ing Wednesday evening, rejected a
constitutional amendment which
would have taken from student rela-
tions committee the power to vote on
charters of campus organizations.

The amendment, proposed by Jules
Green, C35, would have made man-
datory the ﬁling with Council of all
proposed charters coming before the
relations body, and would have given
to Council, and not to student rela-
tipns, the ﬁnal voice in approving or
reﬁecting organization constitutions.

Green proposed the amendment as
the result of the discussion during
the Council meeting last week, when
the power of student relations com-
mittee, under Ray McCune, E34, was
questioned. Failure of McCune to re-
port on his committee’s ﬁndings had
led to argument, in particular, over
the refusal of the League for Social
Justice charter.

After McCune had read the minutes
of his group before Council, and after
the procedure in regard to club char-
ters had been explained, Green called
for a straw vote on Ills amendment.
A ﬁnal vote was impossible, since
constitutional amendments are voted
upon the meeting after they are pro-
posed. With Council voting “No,”
Green withdrew his proposal.

In place of the defeated recommen-
dation, McCune moved that the pres-
iident of the legislative body be author-
‘ized to hold over for Council import-
:ant matters coming before sub-com-
tmittees. The motion, which allows
'-the president also to stop action on
:such business until Council meets,
was unanimously adopted.

excused from classes to attend the
luncheon.

Homer VVadsworth, C35, director of
the campaign, will have a staff of 400
students covering every branch of
the undergraduate schools in the Uni»
versity and the camp-us fraternities.
This staff will receive ﬁnal instruc-
tions and literature concerning the
campaign at the Monday luncheon.

Wadsworth, in summing up the rea-
sons behind the drive, which unites
four campaigns into one, states, “By
combining our efforts behind the
Student Chest, we shall not only be
relieving you of the bother of tag-
days, but also will be giving you the
opportunity of supporting, by one con-
tribution, the oflicial student welfare
projects on the campus.

Student contributions to the Stu-
dent Chest will be split per dollar in
the following way: 50 cents to the
Welfare fund of Pittsburgh, which
cares for human needs in the commu-
nity and contributes to the YMCA;
25 cents to the Student Loan fund;
20 cents to the YWCA, and ﬁve cents
to Pitt-in-China. However, after
$2,000 has been distributed, the re-
maining money will be divided equal-
ly between the Student Loan fund and
the VVelfare fund of Pittsburgh.

Ray McCune, C34, fraternity chair-
man for the drive, says, “The Student
Chest is a real cause to support.
Every fraternity man on the campus
should feel responsible to back the
drive 100 per cent. I not only expect
a 100 per cent support by Pitt frater-
nities, but a 100 per cent donation,
also.” Interfraternity council at its
last meeting voted to support the
drive to the fullest extent of its

 

ability.
Individual soliciting is planned
where students cannot be reached

through fraternities, classes, seminars
and school groups.

The chairman of the campus groups
follow: College senior class, Howard
Cohen; College junior class, Edward
Brethauer; sophomore E n g 1 i s h
classes, Seymour Evans; freshman
English classes, Jack Kurtz, C35;
men’s and women’s fraternities, Ray

McCune. and Helen Milliron; engi-
neers, John Holbrook; junior men,

Not many smokers have seen a ﬁne tobacco plant in full
bloom, so we show you this picture. Only a few of these
ﬁne plants are permitted to ﬂower and to produce seed.
These carefully selected seeds reproduce the following
year the "Cream of the Crop” for your Lucky Strike, for
tobacco must be grown from seed each year. This careful
breeding of ﬁne tobaccos explains why Luckies maintain
the same ﬁne, uniform quality from year to year——so

Nectar Or Strychnine
By Edward J. Waldman, Jr.
Editor-in-Chief
The Duquesne Duke

% OMORROW AFTERNOON TWO FOOTBALL contin-

gents will renew a rivalry restrained since October of
1932. Student bodies of both the University of Pitts-
burgh and Duquesne university have utmost conﬁdence
in the abilities and stamina of their respective varsity
squads. Each clamors for triumph, knowing full well
that both teams cannot win. It is gratify-ing that we
are able to feel certain there is no need to urge either
body to give its team vigorous support, for the loyalty of
both student bodies has long since been proved conclu-
sively.

No matter what the result, we ﬁrmly believe that stu-
dents will show that they can be genuine sportsmen in
knowing how to accept either triumph or adversity. In
the course of human endeavor we have often struggled
to victory and many times have sunk to defeat. We
have quaffed the nectared wines of success, afterwards
to be compelled to swallow the bitter, stinging strychnine
of failure. We enter tomorrow’s competition determined
to return with the laurel, but perhaps a more admirable

virtue is our ability to be good losers—to be greater in
defeat than in victory.

It is our hope, and that of. most Pittsburghers as well,
that this contest will be the second in a long and unin-
terrupted series of intercollegiate competition between
the two contestants. It is for the purpose of moulding
friendship between the representatives and student
bodies of the contesting schools that all competition is
primarily intended. Surely the keen-spirited but friend-

ly rivalry characteristic of the gridiron is one of the
finest means of attaining this end.

The World Is Too Much With Us?

UCH ARGUMENT HAS ENSUED with the begin-
ning of every college year over the reality of the
“academic environment,” a distinct and easily approach-
able sphere in the college and university world where
bitter winds from the outside can never penetrate. “In-
tellectual” students have derided athletes, campus organi-
zations, and college student newspapers as lacking re-
spones to the “academic environment.” The prevalence of
such feeling among a certain group in most colleges and
universities is fast becoming a sad commentary on Ameri-
can educational methods, methods in which one group
feels that it can be divorced from a world, a hard, mat-
ter-of-fact world, in which the same group will soon have
to make a living and from which it derives every meas-

ure of its sustenance, intellectual and material.

In metropolitan centers, New York and Chicago, where
the student bodies of the city colleges and universities
are largely composed of the sons and daughters of the
American proletariat, we see the germination of some-
thing that some day might result in the true university
type in America. College curricula and college activities
cannot divorce themselves from a world which needs
them as much as the college needs the world. The cruel,
cruel world, trite as the phrase might seem, is really a
cruel, cruel world to a group of college people who seek
to -become a separate group, gaining whatever they can
from it by a simple system of painless intellectual
osmosis.

When we come to class at the University every morn-
ing we do not leave "‘the World” for an “academic en-
vironment.” The social, political, and economic struc-
tures which depend to such a great degree on college
men and college women do not deserve to be so politely
snubbed. If the World is too much with our “academic
environment,” it’s a healthy sign. At least We belong
to “the world.”

Tryouts Start
For Rifle Team

Competitive Matches Played On
Thursday Afternoons

  

Lieutenant Arthur E, Wilson, coach
of the varsity riﬂe team, announces
that tryouts for the squad will be con-
ducted daily. Candidates should re-
port from 1:30 to 5:00 o’clock, ex-
cept Saturday and Sunday, during the
period from November 6 to December
1, at the Stadium riﬂe range.

Lieutenant Wilson says that any
sophomore student, whether enrolled
in ROTC or not, may report. Also
eligible to tryout are sophomores in
ROTC, who last year as freshmen
qualiﬁed either as marksmen, sharp-
shooters or expert riﬂemen in ROTC
instruction practice, and all members
of last year’s varsity or ROTC riﬂe
squads. Participation on the varsity
riﬂe team is subject to the regular re-
strictions for intercollegiate sports,

Candidates for the team will be re-
quired to fire the complete small-
bore riﬂe course in four positions:
prone, sitting, kneeling and standing.
No candidate who fails to make a
total score of 360 will be accepted for
the varsity riﬂe team.

This year Lieutenant Wilson will
organize the squad into three teams,
A, B and C. Membership on each

team will be determined by com- ,

petitive matches, which will take
place every Thursday afternoon. Dur-
ing the month of December no as-
signments will be made to team A.
However, beginning January 3, places
on team A will be ﬁlled in order of
merit among members of the entire
riﬂe squad who attain a minimum
score of 270 in three positions. There-
after, throughout the entire season,
individual scores will be compared
each week, and membership of the
teams will be shifted in accordance
with the improvement shown by each
individual. Members whose scores do
not show a gradual improvement, or
whose average score for a three-week
period falls below 260, will be au-
tomatically dropped from the squad.
