PAT Bus
kills man

By Marc Duchin

News Editor

At approximately 8:23 p.m. on
Saturday night, a P_AT busstruck
and killed a 42-year-old Michigan
man in the bus lane on Fifth
Avenue near Meyran Avenue, ac-
cording to Pittsburgh police.

"The [PAT bus] driver said the
man was standing on the side-
walk and appeared to be looking
to the right," said Sgt. Paul

‘Donaldson of the Pittsburgh

Police. "He [the victim] wasn't
familiar with the area.”
According to police, the man,
identified as Robert M. Rairick of
St. Clair Shores, Mich., stepped in
front of an eastbound bus and
was trapped underneath the bus’s
wheels. He was pronounced
dead at the Presbyterian-
University Hospital trauma unit.
”We can only guess what hap-
pened,” said Donaldson. "It
looks like an accident.”
Donaldson said that PAT is
conducting an investigation of
the accident, and that he doesn't
expect any criminal charges to be

Pitt Greeks F collected
$89,000 for the Western Penn-
sylvania School for Blind Chil-
dren, which was ‘$14,000
more than their goal.

'’I was ecstatic,” said Robin
Hunn, overall co-chairperson
of Greek Week. "We thought
there was a problem with can-
ning. We were scared we
weren't going to make it.”

Lee Brody, overall co-
chairperson, said, "The results
were amazing. l thought
$75,000 was such a steep goal
[last year's total]. I never ex-
pected to surpass that.”

The overall winner for the
fraternities for the fifth year in
a row was Delta Tau Delta.
Second place went to the
brothers of Pi Lamba Phi and
third place to Delta Sigma Phi.

Delta Delta Delta was the
overall winner for the sorori-
ties for the fourth year in a row

Delts and Tri—DeIts
win Greek Week

while Chi Omega and Alpha
Epsilon Phi received second
and third place, respectively.

The charity winner for the
fraternities was Delta Tau Del-
ta, collecting $16,400. Second
place went to Delta Sigma Phi
and third place to Zeta Beta
Tau.

Charity winners for the
sororities included Delta Del-
ta Delta in first place, collect-
ing over $6,000. Second place
was held by Alpha Epsilon
Phi, and third place by Kappa
Kappa Gamma.

"l’m really surprised. We
raised much more than last
year,” said Debbie Cohn, a
sister of Delta Delta Delta.

Hunn said her goals for‘

Greek Week were to have the
most successful Greek Week
possible and to get the Greek
Week name "out there.”

’’I think we're more
received by the outside now,”
said Hunn.

BAS elects 1988 officers

By Julie Shepard

Assistant News Editor

Celeste Myers and Maria Ker-
sey have been named the Black
Action Society's Chairperson and
Deputy Chairperson respectively
for the 1988-89 school year.

’’I’m definitely pleased,” said
Myers. ”Now that we're in office,
we'll be able to implement the
programs we talked about at
‘Meet the Candidates'.”

Some of those ideas included
a big brother and sister program
for incoming freshmen and a
BAS-operated tutoring service.

Myers also said her new posi-
tion will be ”a lot of hard work
 but me and Maria can do the
job."

Myers said her main goal for
the upcoming year is to spark and
increase the interest in BAS again.
"Maria ‘and I plan to start with the
close friends we have _and go by
word of mouth from there-,” said
Myers, "once we get that interest,
we hope that's when people will
pour into the programs we have.”

’’I think they will do an excel-

lent job," said Monique Sims,
outgoing chairperson for BAS.
”They both possess a positive at-
titude and a determination to get
things done. I know they won't
have any problemsat all.”

6‘  

Now that we're in
office, we'll be able to
implement the pro-
grams we talked about
at ' ’Meet the Can-

didates."
—- Celeste Myers

Sandra Sanders, elections
chairperson, said approximately
100 people voted in this year's
election.

”We clarified a lot of problems
that happened last year,” said
Sanders. ’

During last year's BAS election,
a controversy arose concerning
the validity of a substantial num-
ber of ballots. BAS resolved that
problem through a re-election
amidst much confusion and fur-

ther controversy within the or-
ganization.

”Our turnout was not as high
as last year,” said Sanders, ”but
we are pleased with it."

Myers said she was disappoint-
ed with the turnout.

”Apparently it wasn't one of
the priorities of the students to
vote,” said Myers.

Sanders said the biggest
problem with the election was
the inability of some BAS mem-
bers to produce their member-
ship card —— an item that, along
with their Pitt ID, was required to
vote.

Sanders also said the applica-
tion process for a new steering
committee will go into effect this
week.

”Without the steering commit-
tee being formed yet, things are
still in the planning process,” said
Sanders.

Myers said, "When we pick
our steering committee it will all
start there. A strong staff can
generate the ideas that we want
to do.” i

Kersey could not be reached
for comment.

Ferraro’s

RUTLAND, Vt. —- Former vice
presidential candidate Geraldine
Ferraro says she blames herself in
part for her son's cocaine convic-
tion, and says the family will ap-
peal the verdict to the Vermont
Supreme Court.

”We still believe he was set
up,” said Ferraro of her 24-year-
old son, John Zaccaro Jr.

A Vermont District Court jury
deliberated for slightly more than
two hours Saturday before find-
ing Zaccaro guilty of selling one-
quarter gram of cocaine to an un-
dercover police officer while he
was a senior at Middlebury Col-

lege two years ago.

No sentencing date was set,
and an appeal could take two
years. The felony conviction car-
ries a maximum sentence of five
years in jail and a $10,000 fine.

At a news conference after the
verdict, Ferraro blamed her son
for possessing cocaine, as well as
herself ”and my candidacy for
making my son a target.” Ferraro
ran on the Democratic ticket with

. Walter Mondale in 1984.

She also criticized former

son convicted of sellingcocaine

Middlebury police Sgt. David
Wemette ”for setting my son up”
and Addison County State's Attor-
ney John Quinn for rejecting a
plea bargain.

”We, as his parents, would not
allow him to plead guilty” to the
felony charge of selling cocaine,
Ferraro said. The family had
asked prosecutors to allow Zac-
caro to plead guilty to a lesser
charge of possession of cocaine.

But Quinn would not accept a
plea for less than a felony. He
said accepting a lesser charge
would have minimized the case
against Zaccaro, when it was
clear to him that Zaccaro’s ac-
tions constituted more than pos-
session.

Nuns want church to
liberalize abortion

CHERRY HILL, N.J. — The RO-
man Catholic Church has not al-
ways banned abortion and
should return to a more liberal
and humane policy on the issue,
two nuns told a regional confer-
ence of the National Organiza-

NEWS BRIEFS
ASSOCIATED mass

tion of Women on Sunday.

The nuns, Barbara Ferraro and
Patricia Hussey, sisters of Notre
Dame De Namur, have refused
to disavow an advertisement in
The New York Times that called
on the Church to have a ”candid
and respectful discussion of the
issue.”

They were among 26 nuns
who signed the ad, which also
said that ”a diversity of opinion
regarding abortion exists among
Catholics.”

Ms. Ferraro and Ms. Hussey
will not speak with the media un-
til their status with the Church is
resolved, said Linda Bowker,
president of the New Jersey chap-
ter of NOW. She said the nuns
could face excommunication.

Bowker said the pair told about
200 women at the mid-Atlantic
regional conference their
research has shown the Catholic
Church allowed abortions in the

19th century under certain cir-
cumstances.

”The church's position has not
been consistent,” Bowker said.

Cops: crooked W. Va.
officials uncovered

WILLIAMSON, W.Va. — It was
bad enough when they convict-
ed Kermit’s police chief for sell-
ing drugs and the fire chief for
setting fires, along with other
members of their clan. Then the

former county sheriff admitted he

sold his job to the highest bidder.

And last week, a special grand
jury returned indictments charg-
ing 16 of Mingo County's most
prominent politicians —— includ-
ing state legislators, a prosecutor
and the mayor of the county seat
—— with bribery and conspiracy to
subvert free elections in Mingo
County.

The grand jury, one of three
convened as part of a special state
and federal task force investigat-
ing corruption in the county, is
not yet finished. Circuit Judge

Libertarian hopes but doesn't expect to win election

 By William Young

News Editor

Libertarian presidential candi-
date Ron Paul is in a tough po-
sition.

Being the nominee for the third
largest political party in the coun-
try would normally sound like a
pretty big honor — if only it

the ballot. Ron Paul needs
33,000 signatures to get his name
on the ballot for this year's
presidential elections. He doesn't
really expect to win, but this
doesn't get him down.

”The goal is always to win,”
Paul said. ”I never expected to

win when I ran in Texas, but I ran
to win, and I did win.”

Ron Paul feels that government
has gotten out of hand and is no
longer performing the functions
that the framers of the Constitu-
tion intended.

”The government is supposed
to protect individual freedom,”
Paul said. ”Government should
be restricted to a more narrow
role —— to protect life, liberty and
ensure that everyone can get a
job.

”The purpose of government is
not to set up a welfare state, not
to police the world,” he added.
”Do we want our government to
protect individual liberty or spe-

cial interest groups?”

Ron Paul sees the reduction of
government control as the single
largest problem that must be dealt
with. Big government interferes
too much in the life of the in-

‘ dividual and causes problems

that need not exist. The Internal
Revenue Service is the prime ex-
ample of what he thinks is wrong
with the present system.

”It’s an economic disaster to
tax a person's income,” he said.
”From 1776 to 1913, we didn't
have an income tax. Not until our
government decided that we
needed to fight wars and send
troops overseas and provide wel-
fare did we have this tax.”

He feels that the power thatthe

I don't feel people should be able
to smoke inside a public build-

lic. If they want to smoke, they
can always step outside for it.

IRS wields is just too great to be
justified by government, and that
even the organization is outside
the principles set down in the
Constitution.

”The reason an income tax is
so evil is the way the IRS uses its
power,” Paul said. ”Records of
tax returns are turned over to
government and‘ used against
people —— which is directly
against the Constitution.”

Another example he cited of
big government getting in the
way of the individual is found in
the courts system.

”I think that the courts do way
too much. They should say
”yes,” something is constitution-

al or ”no,” something’s not con-
stitutional,” Paul said. ”The
courts should rule on whether
something is legal according to
the Constitution, not arbitrarily
write what they think should be
done.” H

Ron Paul feels that the U.S.
government is no longer the one
the writers of the Constitution
wanted.

”We [the U.S.] were the first to
really ever experiment with free-
dom, and we have literallly
thrown it out the window.”

Ron Paul will be speaking
tonight in room 120 of David
Lawrence Hall on the topic of
”The Libertarian Alternative.”

‘Repeating support

for the convicted

Over the weekend, it was announced that yet another of Rea-
gan’s top aides was sentenced to 90 days in jail, two years pro-
bation and given a fine of $300,000 for illegally using his White
House influence to gain contracts for WedtechCorp., among
others. The aide, Lyn Nofziger, had held a post as political ad-

visor for the Reagan team.

Nofziger is currently free pending appeal, and maintains his
own innocence in the scandal. Even if he is found guilty, he
said, which he vehemently claims not to be, he should not have
to go to prison. ”I don't believe I've done anything ethically,
legally or morally wrong,” Nofziger said. '

At their vacation home in California, Nancy Reagan et al. said
that Nofziger was a ”dear friend of many years” and that the
prayers of the Reagans were with him.

Which is almost exactly like what the Reagans said about
Edwin Meese when his first, or maybe it wasssecond, scandal
came to light. It bore an unsettling resemblance to the remarks
made by Reagan about Micheael Deaver, and Oliver North,

and Elliot Abrams.

Perhaps it's time for the president, even though his term in
office is nearly expired, to take a position on the allegations
of wrongdoing under his roof, rather than on the social history
involved. Besides, being a ”dear friend” of the Reagans," it has
been shown, is not the most comforting support one can have
in the courtrooms of this country.

Liddy Dole would

There was always something
cute about the power couple's
banter. Elizabeth and Robert
Dole could make their life as
Secretary and Senator sound like
Katherine Hepburn and Spencer
Tracy on the silver screen.

There was the famous bed
joke, of course. A man wrote to
Sen. Dole to complain about the
People magazine portrait of Bob
making the bed with his wife.
”You don't know the half of it,”
wrote back the Senator. ”The

only reason she was helping me-

make the bed was because they
were taking pictures.”

There was the time the report-
er asked Bob how he'd feel about
a Bush—Dole ticket in 1988. The
Senator remembers answering,
"I'm not sure. To tell you the
truth, I don't believe I'd really be
interested.” ”Good,” said the
reporter, ”Because I wasn't think-
ing of you.”

But now the jokes are sound-
ing serious.

Last fall, Liddy Dole quit her
job to campaign for her husband.
They went from being the Sena-
tor and the Secretary to being the
presidential candidate and the
wife, or in the code words of the

Secret Service, Ramrod and
Rainbow.

Liddy Dole’s closest aides and
supporters were afraid that this
ambitious and visible woman
would be ”wifed,” a mysterious
process by which candidates’
wives are often turned into ador-
ing Nancys. They were con-
cerned that her identity and
resume would be undercut by a
term as the helpmeet.

But in the wake of Robert
Dole’s departure from the race,
Liddy may turn into the ultimate
re-entry woman. She could be the
Dole on the national ticket, the
Republican candidate for second
spot

Liddy Dole doesn't offer the
Republicans that mysterious geo-
graphic balance we hear about.
George Bush of Maine and Texas
can do that all by himself. Nor
has she held elective office. But
when Jesse Jackson is a top vote-
getter, that may be less important.
She has run a department with
10,000 employees and a $27 mil-
lion budget, more than most
governors.

In an era when a ticket is
balanced more by demography
than geography, this particular

We must go back to Vietnam

In reading John McNulty’s let-
ter in Thursday's [March 31] Pitt
News, I thought a few things. I
agree that there is some kind of
gross exploitation going on in the

movie business, and I understand .

his resentment of that.

The point is [...] the attraction
I feel to the Vietnam war is pure-
ly out of a need to understand it.
I want to know what it was like
for everyone involved in it, to an-
swer why we are in Vietnam [for]
those of us not involved. The an-
swer, I think, is so we can help
you get out of it. You do admit
in the last line that you are still
there. Everyone needs to get it out
of their system, including us.

The movies won't prevent wars
from happening, but they do help
show . us the hell you went
through. The past, before it be-
comes their past, must be reflect-
ed upon — until that moment, it
is still the present. [...].

LETTERS

You think we can't understand
the terror of the firefights unless
we were there? Wrong. Terror is
terror, no matter what the source
of it. We are back there because
we need to be. The whole coun-
try needs to relive the war in ord-
er to understand it. [...]

It's taken 20 years for us to face
the music, to look at what hap-
pened and to learn from it. It's
been in the back of our minds
since the moment you were
there; and only now are we brave
enough to look at it up close.

The memories of the war are
not by any means to be forgotten,
or made more pleasant. They
should be brought out in all their
force, as if they were happening
now. That's the only way we will

ever place it- in perspective and
be able to move on.

Many lessons are yet to be
learned from the Vietnam war,
and further tries to repress those
cries of ”Why?” will keep you
there longer. It is time to answer
the ”why?”s and to live with the
answers. It is what we must do to
learn from it, to bring something
good, for once, out of it. The
good is the understanding. It is
not ”Why?” anymore. It is sim-
ply ”Because.” .

There will be more war; there
will be more death; there will be
more murder until we begin to
understand ourselves; and our
world in a true light. Yes, the
truth hurts, but you must admit,
it's better than falseness or blatent
lies. [...]

make a good running mate

 

ELLEN

woman offers a good deal to the
Republicans. Women in politics
— fairly or not —— are seen as
clean, and this one has a squeaky
reputation. She is one member of
the Reagan team who can mute
the Meese-and-sleaze factor.

As a running mate, she would
also defuse the rap Bush has
taken on civil rights. Bush has not
been as popular with women as
with men. Nor, for that matter,
has the Republican party. The im-
age and allegiance can shift if he
picked a woman for the second
spot. He could increase his ap-
peal among baby-boomers. He

might even ——- hold your breath

,— look bold.

Nor would Bush have to reach
deep into the ranks for ”a wom-
an.” The Secretary of Transporta-
tion was one of the first to say
after Geraldine Ferraro’s nomina-
tion: ”The stature of women
everywhere would be diminished
if a candidate were supported
simply because she's a woman.”
It was a strategy Republicans de-
vised to sound anti-Ferraro
without sounding anti-female.
But it's also clearly a pro-Dole
message.

One of Liddy Dole’s political
skills is to appeal simultaneously
to liberals and conservatives. A
graduate of Duke in the years that
produced feminist leader Ellie
Smeal and Massachusetts Lt.
Gov. Evelyn Murphy, and a
graduate of Harvard Law School,
she is the sort of Iadylike wom-
en's rights activist that passes
muster in. Republican circles
while widening those circles.

What of the old power-couple
jokes? Would Li_ddy Dole see a
political partnership with George
Bush as a peculiar kind of infidel-
ity to her defeated husband?
We're not talking Vikings here;

we're talking Republicans. I
doubt that feelings will remain
that sour all the way to New
Orleans.

Closer to home, would the
Dole’s own careful coupling be
affected if she took a turn as
senior partner? In their marriage,
as in many, husband and wife
rode side by side until the path
narrowed. Each time that hap-
pened, Bob took the lead. In his
words, ”I’d say I got the better of
the deal.” A man who knows that
may also be comfortable with an
even deal.

I don’t know that Liddy Dole
would want the vice-presidential
nomination. But remember what
her husband wrote about his own
decision to run for Vice President
in 1976: ”There’s an old rule in
American politic; that says you
don't run for Vice President.
Neither do you run away from
the job if it's offered.” If the
Republicans are smart, they'll
offer it.

’ A: Of course that would be
crass. In the present era, a man
can treat his girlfriend or she can
treat him or they can go Dutch,
with separate checks — the guy
doesn't have to pay for every-
thing she eats, drinks, rides in,
looks at or dances to. I say ”in the
present era," but for me, the
present era goes back quite a few
years. In my youth, poor students
and many young people were
casual about who paid. I per-

. no sex.” I often have to tell a girl

that if a man only comes to her
place late in the evening and
strictly for sex, no talking, no go-
ing for a walk, no sharing a meal
or a movie with her, no introduc-
ing her to friends, then he is just
using her and she ought to wash
that guy right out of her hair.
Q: I am a 45-year-old virgin un-
der a good deal of stress from
family and other problems. I have
been told that masturbating
would relieve tension and

 

depression. is there any truth in
this?

A: Masturbation is not a cure
for unhappiness. For a depressed
person, trying to relieve his mis-
ery by masturbation could very
well make him more miserable.
It could start him thinking how he
has to do this for himself, that he
has no partner for sex, no inti-
mate companionship to warm his
existence.

If you have a spell of the blues,
the best thing is to let it pass; if,
on the other hand, you know you
have been depressed for a long
time and suspect it won't go
away, the best thing to do is talk
to a counselor. This is what cler-
gymen, psychiatrists, psychother-
apists, school counselors and
social workers are good for. I am
not suggesting that all those
categories are the same, but there
is help in each of them. And they

can steer you to the type of
professional help you need.
Don't keep trying home reme-
dies for a chronic illness, such as
this idea that masturbation will

help you. Also, avoid alcohol and

mood-changing drugs. unless
professionally prescribed. Get
real help with your real problem.

Masturbation has been
described as a release from sex-
ual tension, yes. But sexual ten-
sion is not an illness, like
depression. Very healthypeople
are most likely to have it. lfthey
masturbate, it is seeking pleasure
— and with enjoyable fantasies
that a depressed person probably
will not be able to summon up.

Q: What percentage of women
indulge in masturbation? I am a
guy, but I want this information
for my girlfriend because she
doesn't think many women do.
She claims that she only half-tried

it once or twice during pubertyﬁ

A: Whatever the answer would
have been, I hope you had no in-
tention of trying to get her to
change her own ways in this mat-
ter. Some women do, some
don't, and it is their choice, OK?

As for statistics on women
masturbating, there are no statis-
tics I trust. If some magazine runs
a survey, then the girls and wom-
en surveyed are all readers of thag
magazine, not a broad sampling
of the whole female population.

I do know nowadays‘ many
women, who were not having or-
gasms duringsex with husbands
or lovers, do masturbate —.— both
to have orgasms and to learn how
to have them so they can teach
the technique to their men. This
is called taking responsibility for
her own sexual pleasure instead
if expecting the man to do it for

er.

Pitt senior Dan Marinelli re-
cently returned to Pitt from a
two-week stay in Central
America. He wasn't on vaca-
tion but on the job with his
army reserve unit, building
roads in Honduras.

Marinelli, a speech commu-
nications major from Greens-
burg, Pa., is a specialist fourth
class with D Company, 429th
Engineer Battalion. He
received an alert warning last
month to prepare to move out,
which his unit did on March
13.

The journey to Honduras in-
volved the engineer unit’s first
being bused to Fort Meade.
Then, via Andrew's Airforce
Base, the unit departed on a

. flight to Palmerolda Airbase in
Honduras.

”From Palmerola, we were
bused 10 hours to Camp Padd-
lehorn, close to where we
were working,” said Marinel-
li. ”Whi|e at Palmerola —
which is a Honduran base, not
American — Honduran Cus-

confiscateour cameras if we

toms officals threatened to '

Student returns from Honduras

photographed the 747 carry-
ing U.S. senators and con-
gressmen who were assessing
the situation.”

Marinelli said that heavy
equipment, including bulldoz-
ers and graders, was shipped
to Honduras prior to his ar-
rival. ”Our mission was to
build Interstate 111 up in the
northeast part of Honduras,”
he said.

According to Marinelli, his
unit was issued two sets of
tropical fatigues, and while he
was never close to the fighting
near the Nicaraguan border, at
least 25 percent of the troops
there carried live ammunition
if they left their compound.

”Our heavy equipment was
guarded at nights by Hondu-
ran troops. They’re good,” he
said.

As a Pitt student, the events
there sparked his interest. As
a reservist, the deployment ful-
filled his annual training re-
quirement. ”We didn't qualify
for overseas or hazardous duty
pay,” said Marinelli.

”My unit suffered no health

F one woman who washed her

problems down there,” he ad-
ded. ”We were warned about
a fly that lays eggs on you af-
ter it bites,,but no one got sick.
We were too high up in the
mountains to worry about
mosquitos.”

Regarding the people in
Honduras, Marinelli’ com-
mented, ”It’s disenheartening
[sic] that people have to live
like that in 1988. I observed

food in water near where we
were using cement. She then
bathed in it, then drank it. But
our medical people are doing
a lot of good. Once a week,
the locals would come to the
camp's gate for having teeth
pulled or shots administered.”

Overall, Marinelli said he
enjoyed his stay in the Yoro
Valley and was positive about
the experience. He said, ”It
was fantastic. The weather was
OK. If I could have stayed
longer, I would have. Hon-
duras is the least economical-
ly developed of the Central
American countries, and
they're our allies — they need
our help.”

Candidates get ”super delegates”

‘By David Morris

Associated Press Writer

HARRISBURG —-— Mas-
sachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis
and the Rev. Jesse Jackson are
picking up support from Pennsyl-
vania's ”super delegates" as the
April 26 primary approaches.

But a survey by The Associat-
ed Press shows eight of the 15
delegates remain uncommitted to
any of the three active can-
didates.

The odd man out for now is
Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore, who
is not the candidate of choice for
any of the super delegates, who
are appointed by the Democrat-
ic National Committee.

But Gore's backers say the sen-
ator still has a chance to win a
share of the 178 delegates who

will be available in the primary,
especially if he does well in the
April 19 primary in New York.

Two super delegates say they
are committed to Dukakis, and
two others are backing Jackson.
Two others remain officially un-
committed but said they prefer
Dukakis, while one is uncommit-
ted but leaning toward Jackson.

Some of the remaining super
delegates are waiting for another,
Gov. Robert P. Casey, to give
them some guidance. Casey has
said he would not endorse a can-
didate before Pennsylvania's
April 26 primary.

Casey spokesman Robert
Grotevant said the governor's de-
cision doesn't preclude the others
from committing to a candidate.
”They are free to make their own

choice,” Grotevant said.

Dukakis has momentum fol-
lowing his April 5 win in Wiscon-
sin, and some polls show him the
most-preferred candidate among
New York voters. The New York
winner is expected to pick up ex-
tra support in Pennsylvania, be-
cause of the proximity of the two
states and the scheduling of the

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, April 11, 1988

The Representative Student
Council, an organization
formed this term to foster par-
ticipation and programming
between the major student or-
ganizations, is planning a
project to commend student
organizations which have ex-
hibited superior achievement
and programming,

The RSC, organized by SGB
member Daryl Grecich, in-
cludes representatives from
SGB, PPC, the governance
groups and student media. A
special ad-hoc committee was
established to formulate criter-
ia for the award.

”We’re thinking of not only
having a plaque but having a
plaque with the logos of every
student organization surround-
ing it," said Grecich.

The ad-hoc committee con-
sists of Grecich, Charles
Farinella, IFC, Monique Sims,
BAS, Polly Speros, PanHel,
Heidi Klingeman, RSA, Giselle
Leonardo, ESC, Mary Ellen
Callaghan, SHAC, Missy
Mastorovich, NSO, Greg
Roby, PPC and Robin Hunn,
Greek Week co-chairman.

”We’re thinking of some-

Organization seeks
to commend students

where in the Union for the
plaque. We thought of having

_an award like this because we

feel that students sometimes
are neglected and “aren't recog-
nized for their achievements," \

. said Grecich. 

The SGB used to bestow the

”Blue and Gold" award to 

outstanding students at
homecoming each year until
the late '70s.

The RSC meets informally
once a month to exchange
ideas and discuss different
events and programs that each
organization is working on-,
according to Grecich.

”The leaders of these or-
ganizations have gotten. to
know one another and hope-

fully will be, in the near future, Q

working with one another to
promote their respective
causes and organizations,”
said Grecich.

Grecich said that there was
once a student assembly in
which a representative of ev-
ery student organization par-
ticipated but that student
apathy resulted in the absen-
teeism of the non-governance
groups.

Friday night's Dapper Dan
Roundball Classic at the Civic
Arena showcased some of the
best high school talent in the
United States. Nearly every one
of the participants has signed
with or is considering playing for
a Division I college.

0 In attendance at the game
were some of the best college
coaches in the country, including
Digger Phelps (Notre Dame), Ed-
die Sutton (Kentucky), Jerry Tar-
kanian (UNLV), Bill Frieder
(Michigan), Dick Tarrant (Rich-

Lady Panthers. She has excelled
at Pitt since transferring from the
University of Tennessee at the
conclusion of her freshman year.

The senior outside hitter from
Farrell has been a first team All-
Big East selectionlfor the last three
seasons. In 1986, she was named
Big East MVP, as well as Lady
Panther MVP. Stewart was re-
cently selected by the Pittsburgh
Chamber of Commerce as Fe-

‘male Athlete of the Year.

Pitt coach Shelton Collier is not

and Pitt's own Paul Evans.

0 Overheard: Dick Vitale to
7-foot Stanley Roberts of the U.S.
West team: ”No way you guys
can play with them [the East]. Bil-
ly Owens is going to score 40
points, and Alonzo Mourning
will block everything.”

The East went on to win
121-100, with Owens scoring
only seven points and Mourning
blocking five shots.

0 Some of the action from the
games:

Orlando Vega, a 6-4 guard
from Oak Hill Academy, Va.,
scored 24 points to lead the U.S.
East All-Stars to a 121-100 victo-
ry over the West squad and was
named Most Valuable Player for

someone to underplay the contri-
butions made by Stewart to the
Lady Panthers. ”Lisa is simply
one of the best players in the his-
tory of the program. She is most
known for her impressive spiking,
but she has been valuable to us
in many other ways as well. She
is an extremely intelligent player
and a highly-skilled all-around
player,” said Collier.

He further stated, ”It was great
to see her end her career here by
accomplishing so much. The

the East. Vega, a fourth—team Pa-
rade All-American who has
signed to play with the Arizona
Wildcats next season, also had
three steals and one assist.

”I didn't expect it [the MVP
award],” Vega said. ”I just came
out to play with the fellas. I didn't
come to show people who I am.
I'm just so happy to have been
picked for the Dapper Dan. It's a
great tournament.”

Brian Shorter, last year's Dap-
per Dan East MVP, also hails
from Oak Hill. After sitting out
this year due to Proposition 48,
the 6-8 Shorter will be in uniform
for Pitt next season.

0 Guards were a unanimous
pick as MVPs -Friday night. An-

team voting her MVP was one of
many awards she received this
year, and I'm sure it will mean a
lot to her.”

Matheis was selected as the
most improved player among the
Lady Panthers. She played very
little as a freshman, but this past
season as a sophomore, she came
ready to play.

Collier noticed the marked im-
provement in Matheis this sea-
son, and it forced him to reassess

his evaluation of her. ”One of the

most important factors in our
team's improvement this year
was Kelly Matheis. She has made
tremendous gains in strength and
skill, and although not expected
to be a starter, she was so im-
proved we simply had to find a
spot on the court for her,” Colli-
er noted. ’
For the second consecutive
year, O’Shaughnessy was select-
ed by her teammates as best prac-
tice player. Collier commented

 Women’s track sets
two school records
at weekend Relays

By Don Boyd

Staff Writer

The Pitt women's track team
proved inhospitable hosts on
Saturday at the Panther Relays.
Proving their affinity for home
cooking, they smoked the oppo-
sition in capturing 13 out of 16
events.

Two Lady Panther relay teams
set school records. The
400-meter relay team of Clarissa
Dudley, Ardy Hope, Pat Cupid
and Keisha Demas finished first
in a time of 46.79 while the
1600-meter‘ relay team of
Michelle Morgan, Gloria Azeke,
Cupid and Demas ran a time of

3:47.21 in finishing second to _

West Virginia in the event.

Dudley, the freshman standout
for the Lady Panthers, captured
two individual titles. She doubled
in the 110-meter hurdles (14.40)
and the 200-meter dash (24.53).

Pitt's Azeke captured the
1500—meter run in a time 4:44.62
with teammate Cathy Chrissos
finishing second.

Chrissos captured the
800-meter run in a time of
2:17.96.

The Lady Panthers’ Demas
continued her mastery in the
400—meter run (55.10), winning
by three seconds over her closest
rival.

In the 100-meter dash, Pitt's
Cupid was the winner. She sprint-
ed to the tape in 12.09.-

Meanwhile, teammate Debbie
Bonner triumphed in the

Guards dominate play in Roundbal

thony Peeler, a four—year starter
and second-team Parade All-
American from Kansas City, M0,,
scored a team—high 19 points and
grabbed five rebounds for the
West team. Although he is only
6-4, Peeler blocked two shots,
showing why he played center
for Paseo High School.

Despite his standout play, Peel-
er didn’t let the award go to his
head. ”Everybody’s an MVP
here,” said Peeler, who will stay
home next year to play for
Missouri

0 Jim McCoy, a 6-3 guard from
Pittsburgh Central Catholic,
showed why he is regarded as the
best guard in Western Pennsylva-
nia. A three-year starter for the

400-meter hurdles. Her clocking
was 12055.36.

In the 3000-meter run, Ellen
Ayoob of the Lady Panthers
decided to run away and hide.
She captured the event in a time
of 10:24.88, better than 23 se-
conds ahead of fellow Pitt stan-
dout Robin Hubauer
finished second.

Pitt's Alexis Archer hop, skip
and jumped 36-feet—8 inches in
winning the triple jump. Team-
mate Dana Roberts took third in
the event.

Valerie Reed was the Lady Pan-
thers’ dominant performer in the
field events. She won the shot put
with a heave of 37 feet. Addition-
ally she hurled the discus
100—feet—7 inches as well as toss-
ing the javelin 86—feet—7 inches in
finishing runnerup in both events.

Pitt's Debbie Fisher airmailedl

the javelin 134-feet-7 inches in
winning the event.

Capturing the discus throw for
the Lady Panthers was Debbie
Raden. Her championship effort
measured out at 104-feet-8
inches.

In assessing the Lady Panthers’
performance, the backyard brawl
anticipated with the West Vir-
ginia Lady Mountaineers never
materialized. Quite simply put,
the Pitt wornen’s track team was
never challenged by their rivals.

thers have established five new

McCoy scored eight points, in-
cluding a thunderous dunk and a
three-point field goal, grabbed six
rebounds, dished out four assists
and had two steals in 20 minutes.

”I had a slow start, because I'm
used to starting,” said McCoy

early-season hitting

Lady gymnasts end season with
fifth place tournament finish

By lenna Hunter
Staff Writer

The women's gymnastics team
finished their 1987-88 season at
Penn State University, where this
year's NCAA Eastern Regionals
were held.

Pitt was seeded third going into
the competition but finished a
disappointing fifth with a 179.1
total.

The Lady Panthers started on
beam, where a few falls brought
their final standing down.

”We lost a point on beam
which immediately hurt our team
placing,” said Coach Debbie
Yohman.

The upperclassmen did not
have any falls on beam. The three
freshmen who competed on
beam, Robyn Borchers, Jeannie

‘Vecchio and Kathy Wallish, all
had nice beam sets, but, unfor- ,

tunately, each had one fall.

Vecchio, who had an excellent
chance to win the beam event as
well as advance to the NCAA Na-
tionals, fell on a back-handspring
layout step-out, a difficult tum-
bling series that she rarely misses.

The fall on beam did not stop
Vecchio, however. On Pitt's last
event, the uneven parallel bars,
Vecchio made her presence
known. She was the last compe-
titor on the unevens and also the

final competitor of the compe-
tition.

After PSU’s last floor competi-
tor finished her routine, all eyes
were on Vecchio, who flowed
through a flawless bar set. She
scored a 9.5 and won the NCAA
Eastern Regional bar title.

‘ 

I was very upset after
beam because I
thought I'd make it to
Nationals on beam be-
fore I made it on bars.

—leannie Vecchio

Vecchio seemed very pleased
with her bar performance but a
little disappointed with her fall on
beam.

”I was very upset after beam
because I thought I'd make it to
Nationals on beam before I made
it on bars,” said Vecchio. ”I was
really glad I was last on bars be-
cause there were seven teams
that already went in front of me,
and I knew ifl nailed my routine
I could win,” she added.

”Nailing” her routine wasn't
the only thing going through Vec-
chio’s mind.

”The main thingxthat stuck in
my mind was something Cathy

I ish.

[Coleman] said to me during bar
warmups. She said she would be
very upset if one of us didn't
make it to NCAAs,” Vecchio
said. '

Unfortunately, Coleman, who
also had a good chance to quali-
fy for NCAAs on the unevens,
had an extra swing in her routine
which hurt her score and her
qualifying chances.

”After Cathy's break in her rou-
tine, I knew it was up to me to
win,” added Vecchio.

As for the floor and vaulting
events, Coach Yohman felt the
performances were good.

”Our floors and vaults were
nice, but our lack of difficulty hin-
dered our scores,” she said.

Co-captains Kim Calderone
and Leann Vaughn, who com-
pete on the most difficult vaults
for Pitt, scored 9.4 and 9.2,
respectively. ,

Overall, Yohman seemed dis-
appointed with the fifth- place fin-
”As a team, I’m real
disappointed that we finished
fifth. Next year, I expect a lot
more difficulty in our routines so

we can finish higher, where we
should be.”

Saturday's competition marked
the final meet for seniors Calder-
one, Coleman and Vaughn.

”I’ll really miss them,” Yoh-
man said.

third baseman Chris Sabo has
never seen anything like Kai
Daniels’ swing.

Sabo marveled at the way
Daniels could spray line drives
around minor-league parks
when they played together in
the Cincinnati Reds’ farm sys-
tem. Now that Sabo has been
promoted, he's had a week to
watch Daniels rip up major-
league pitching with the same
sweet stroke.

”He’s the best hitter I've
ever seen, and I've been tell-
ing people that for a long
time,” Sabo said. ”I told peo-
ple this guy’s the best, day in
and day out. Unbelievable.”

Daniels opened the 1988
season the way he ended the
last one,‘with the kind of hit-
ting spree that leaves oppo-
nents and teammates in awe.
The left-handed-hitting out-
fielder went 11-for-17 (.647)
with three home runs, three
- doubles, four walks and nine
runs batted in during the Reds’
first four games.

He powered them to a 5-4
victory Saturday over
Houston, hitting two homers
and singling home two runs in
the ninth inning, completing a
4-for-4 performance. .

Daniels, 24, was hobbled by
a bad knee that required mid-
season surgery last year. He
was also overshadowed by the
outstanding play of teammate
Eric Davis.

Batting leadoff, Daniels hit

.334 in 108 games with 26

CINCINNATI —- Rookie 8

homers and 64 RBI. His .617
slugging percentage would
have led the National League,
but he didn't have enough at-
bats to qualify.

His most impressive num-
bers came late in the season,
when he hit.381 in his last 28
games,

”I finished the season last
year in this kind of a groove,
and I've just continued,” he
said. _

Daniels isn't as flashy defen-
sively as Davis and won’t steal
as many bases, but he is some-
thing special with the bat. He
can hit for average and hit to
all fields with power.\He can
drive an outside pitch to left
field with power — two of his
three homers this season have
been to the opposite field.

”He’s a potential batting
champion with a lot of pow-
er,” Manager Pete Rose said.
’’I think we've got him hitting
now where he belongs —
third.”

In the No. 1 spot last season,
Daniels opened eight games
with homers. With right fielder
Dave Parker traded to Oak-
land during the off-season,
Rose moved Daniels to the
No. 3 spot in the batting ord-
er, in front of Davis.

Davis has started slowly, hit-
ting only one homer and driv-
ing in threeiruns in the first
four games. _

But Rose likes the Daniels-
Davis combination.

”They’re like two kegs of dy-
namite — if the left one
doesn't get you, the right one
will,” Rose said.

without question the most team-

coached, and this includes the
Olympic Team and the [Wom-

”I knew when I recruited her
she had a very special quality,
and our team has reaped the
benefits for the last four years,”
Collier observed.

The Coaches Award, presented
each year to the player , who
makes a unique contribution to
the team, went to Ziener.

Collier feels the senior outside
hitter has made a number of out-
standing contributions. ”There
[are] so many great things to say
about Krista, she is truly one of
the most respected players on our
team. She came through in many
crucial situations all year long.

’’Probably the biggest compli-
ment I can give Krista is that as
a result of my association with
her I believe I am not only a bet-
ter coach, but a better person as
well, and I will always be grate-
ful for that,” he added.

With Stewart, O’Shaughnessy,
Ziener and middle-blocker
Noreen Coughlin all finishing
their Pitt volleyball careers, Col-
lier had to bid adieu to a talent-
ed senior class.

”lt’s difficult to say which

all contributed so much in so
many ways to [our] having a great
team this past season. We have

Lyle wins first Masters’ crown
by one stroke over Calca vecchia

By Bob Green
AP Golf Writer

AUGUSTA, Ga. -—- Sandy Lyle,
once teetering on the brink of col-
lapse, extricated himself from a
fairway bunker on the 72nd hole
and then sank a 12-foot birdie
putt for a one-shot victory Sunday
in the 52nd Masters.

Lyle, a husky Scot who won the
1985 British Open, was tied for
the lead with Mark Calcavecchia
until the final stroke of the tour-
nament sent the putt downhill
and into the cup. It finished off a
1-under-par 71 and made Lyle
the first British subject to win this
storied tournament.

Lyle had to come out of a
yawning fairway bunker on the
18th hole of the Augusta Nation-
al Golf Club course. He ran hope-
fully onto the fairway to follow
the flight of the ball, which hit be-
yond the cup and backed up
toward the hole while the gallery
howled for still more roll.

Lyle, who had blown a two-
shot lead and trailed as late as the
15th hole, rolled the winning putt
into the back of the cup.

It gave him a total of 281 , seven
shots under par.

Lyle also became the only
three-time winner on the Ameri-
can PGA Tour this season and
first man to win consecutive tour-
nament titles since West German
Bernhard Langer won the Masters

and the Heritage Classic in 1985.
Lyle came into the Masters off a
victory in the Greater Greensboro
Open.

Calcavecchia, a man from the
wrong side of golf’s tracks and a
caddy as recently as three years
ago, finished second with a
2-under-par 70 in the bright,
warm sunshine. He had a 282 to-
tal, six under par.

Craig Stadler, the 1982 Masters
winner, once had a share of the
lead, but dropped back with a
16th-hole bogey and finished
third at 283. Stadler, who bolted
into contention with a 12-foot ea-
gle putt on the eighth hole, had
a closing 68. .

Another former champion,
1984 winner Ben Crenshaw, fol-

,lowed at 284 after a hard-won

72. He was Lyle's playing partner
in the final twosome that played
over the flowered hills and val-
leys of the course Bobby Jones
built.

Greg Norman, the white-haired
Australian who was runner-up in
the last two Masters, started the
day 1 1 shots back but burst into
contention with a record-
matching 30 over the front side.

But the putts stopped falling
with the same regularity on the

_back nine and, although finishing

with a 64 that was the best round
of the tournament, he actually ex-
pressed disappointment.

’’I thought ifl could get it to five

under [par] the other guys might
start thinking, ‘How can he shoot
62 out there’ and worrying about
my score instead of theirs,” Nor-
man said. »

But he couldn't quite make it,
finishing in a tie at 285, three un-
der par, with Don Pooley and
Fred Couples.

Pooley had a closing 70 and
Couples 71.

South African David Frost was
at 286 after a 68. Tom Watson
and Bernhard Langer were at
287. Watson, a two-time Masters
champion, shot 71 and Langer, a

.West German who won here in

1985, had a 73.

Lyle regained a share of the
lead with a birdie putt of about
12 feet on the 16th, prompting
him to perform a happy little
dance.

By that time, the holes had run
out on the other contenders and
it was a two-man race.

Calcavecchia parred’ home and
the gritty Lyle nailed it down with
the dramatic putt on the 18th.

In addition to the famed green
jacket that goes to the winner,
Lyle collected $183,800 from the
total purse of $1 million, pushing
his leading money—winning total
to $591,821 for the year.

Seve Ballesteros of Spain, a
two-time Masters winner, never
really got in the hunt over the fi-
nal 18 holes and finished with a
73 for 288.

Eleventh green is a
problem in Masters

By Ron Sirak

AP Sports Writer

AUGUSTA, Ga. — The 11th
green at Augusta National
Golf Club was resting in peace
early Sunday, waiting for the
start of the final round of the
1988 Masters tournament.

If you listened to the players,
No. 11 needed an undertaker,
not a greenskeeper.

If you listened to tourna-
ment officials, reports of the
death of the 11th green were
greatly exaggerated.

There was an ambulance
parked near the 1 1th tee Sun-
day morning, but that
presumably was for the animal
matter on the course, not the
vegetable.

And a careful inspection of
the 11th green prior to the start
of the final round failed to rev-
eal desperate green-coated
officials giving mouth-to-cup
resuscitation to an expiring
putting surface.

So who to go to for a check
of the vital signs?

Greens superintendent Paul
Latshaw was about as difficult
to find as a player happy with
the conditions of the course.

Latshaw gave his evaluation
of the situation through the
body of tournament chairman
Hord Hardin. ,

’’I keep hearing that the 11th
green is dead,” Hardin said
Sunday. ’’I spoke with Latshaw
this morning and he said No.
11 is alive and well and will
be here long after these guys
are gone.” ~

That patch of grass stuck in
one of the most beautiful corn-
ers of the course had become
the whipping post for players
frustrated by hard, fast putting
surfaces.

”That green is dead,” Ben
Crenshaw said Saturday after
shooting a 67, the best round
of the day. ”There is nothing
out there alive at all.”

Bernhard Langer of West
Germany, who shot a 71,
agreed. He suggested tying
someone with a hose to the
green ”for the next three
hours.”

Fuzzy Zoeller said putting
was ”war, total war.”

One of the few defenders of
the greens among the players
was Tom Watson.

”This is what a major cham-
pionship is all about,” he said.

Watson got a good taste of
what it was all about Saturday
when he four-putted from 10
feet on No. 16.

Mark O’Meara and Seve
Balesteros also needed four
putts to make that hole on
Friday.

Four-time Masters champi-
on Arnold Palmer joined the
dispute Saturday. Palmer, who
missed the cut for the final two
rounds, said the condition of
the greens was ”a disservice to
the game” and questioned
whether fans want to see ”the
best players in the world four-
putt or bounce over the
greens.” c

’’I guess we have a differ-
ence of opinion over how Bob
Jones wanted this ‘ game
played," Hardin said.

“Some people can he alone in a crowd: character
actress—.ludith‘S|oan can he a crowd all alone"

IUP latest victim in
Panther tennis team’s
recent winning streak

By Vince Longo
Staff Writer

The Pitt men's varsity tennis
team followed wins over Du-
quesne (5-0, shortened due to
rain) and Youngstown State (8-1)
with a 6-3 win over Indiana (Pa.)
Saturday that placed them just
three wins shy of posting their
best record since George Dieffen—
bach became head coach in
1976.

‘ 

Their top two guys

weren't so good.

matches remaining.

ed Jeff Robson 6-0, 6-3.

The Panthers needed to win
just one doubles match but
walked away with two wins out
of three. Mills-Maben lost to
Hanes—Welker, lUP’s best two
players, 4-6, 5-7; Meyerowich-
Campbell defeated Smith—Nuss
6-4, 6-3; and Kumar-Winicour
had little trouble with Robson-
Gliozzi, 7-5, 6-3. I ~

If the Panthers can win their re-
maining three matches against
Edinboro, Mercyhurst and the
University of Buffalo, they will
finish the season with a record of
13-7, a .650 percentage mark. In
1985, Dieffenbach’s best year so
far, Pitt was 13-8 (.619).

However, winning the remain-
ing three matches will be a very
difficult task, although not exact-
ly a long shot.

”All three [remaining] matches
are tough. All three could go
either way,” said Kumar. ”They
should all go 5-4 one way or the
other.”

But don't think that Saturday's
win over IUP was a breeze. IUP
was good — well, at least their
top two players, anyway. ‘

”Their top two guys were
tough; the rest weren't so good,”
said Meyerowich.

The 1UP match was the final
home match of the season for the

Panthers.

Lewis starting to turn women ’s
track program in right direction

By Debbi Edwards

For The Pitt News

Head coaches at Pitt seem to
be accomplishing a lot in a short
period of time —— three years, to
be exact. Head football coach
Mike Gottfried finished 8-3 last
season and led the Panthers to
their first bowl appearance since
1984.

Paul Evans directed his basket-
ball team tova 24-7 record, a Big
East regular-season champion-
ship and an NCAA tournament
invitational. _

The women's track coach may
not be receiving overwhelming
publicity, but he is silently carv-
ing his name into Pitt history.

Steve Lewis has essentially
written his own record books
since taking the position in the
fall of 1985. Indoor track offers
32 events, and his students own
25 records. Fourteen school bests
are in the books for outdoor
events, and that does not include
the 1988 season.

Without the constant force of
Lewis’ coaching talents, rapid
and impressive moves wouldn't
be a possibility.

”No coach is particularly easy
to work with because they set
their own goals,” junior Pat
Cupid explained. ”But Coach
Lewis has been the best to work
with. He won't let me sell myself
short. He seems to know my abil-
ities better than I know [them]

myself."

Most track members agreed
that Lewis can be tough during
practices but quickly added that
it eventually pays off.

‘ 

With the balanced
mixture of experience
and talented ‘freshmen,
the Pitt women's track
team has proved to be
something to contend
with.

—Steve Lewis

Luanne Harris, a junior sprinter
and hurdler, offered some adjec-
tives in reference to her coach:
dedicated, tough, hardworking
and strict. She continued with a
smile, ”He really is very caring
and a friend. He has our best in-
terests in mind.”

A veteran on the team, senior
Dana Roberts seemed to have
carefully thought out description
of her coach.

”He is a very inquisitive and
philosophical man with a strong
dictatorship [sic] personality, as
well as being a respectable and
dedicated coach,” Roberts said.

Before beginning his career at
Pitt, Lewis worked at the high-
school level.. He was a boy's
basketball coach and junior var-

sity football coach. He also
coached boy's track and girl's
cross-country.

Lewis developed 34 track All-
Americans, four national record
holders and 12 indoor and out-
door state championship teams at
the high-school level.

One may assume he likes to
win.

”The girls are working very
hard this year,” said Lewis. ”We
are looking towards competing
very hard at the Big East and win-
ning atop place.”

A Big East championship
would have been a dream goal to
the team that, ‘two years ago,
finished last in the Big East.
However, with the outstanding
performances of Lewis’ recruiting
classes, the dream is very much
a reality.

”With the balanced mixture of
experience and talented fresh-
men, the women's track team has
proved to be something to can-
tend with,” Lewis remarked.

Receiving Big East honors will
not obstruct higher goals the
coach and athletes have in sight.
The team has made strong show-
ings in the Eastern champion-
ships, and they hope to improve
their performances there.

With only three graduating
seniors, the young team's future
looks very promising. And with
the direction of a determined and
ambitious coach, challenges be-
come one more hurdle to jump.
