  Trustees pass budget,
tuition to go up again

By Lisa B. Keer
Senior Editor

Next year’s Pitt student will have

one thing in common with his prede-

cessors of the past 10 years: He will
be paying more for tuition.

Pitt’s Board of Trustees yesterday
approved a fiscal year 1985 budget
of $383.4 million that includes a tui-
tion increase of 9.5 percent"- the
same increase as last year — or $230
for in-state undergraduate students.

, The tuition increases will raise
full-time, in-state undergraduate
tuition for the College of Arts and
Sciences to $2,650.

Tuition for other schools and
branch campuses will also increase.
the lowest being a 4.3 percent
increase for first-year medical stu-
dents and the highest coming for law
students, who face a 12.1 percent
hike. » '

_ The proposed budget will now
await approval of $87.1 million in
state appropriations, recommended
by Pennsylvania Governor,Richard
Thornburgh.

Thornburgh’s proposal represents

a 7 percent increase over the pre- E

vious -year‘s funding butfalls short
of the 16.4 percent increase Pitt
administrators had requested.

If approved, the 1985 budget will
raise faculty and staff salaries by
$10.2 million, a 7 percent over last
year.

Senior Vice Chancellor Jack

  

Ray Wuslich
A.E. Lawson was the only
trustee to oppose yester-
day's tuition hike

Freeman blamed ‘the tuition
increases on the smaller state appro-
priation and added that when

"adjusted for inﬂation, the tuition

rate will approach, that of 1977.
“Our hope was to keep tuition
increases to 5 percent, rather than
the 9.5 percent most of our students

will experience,” Freeman said.
Freeman cited as further reasons
for the tuition hikes a small decline
in the number of students antici-
pated — students actually attending
as opposed to those accepted -— and
a loss of about $4 million in research
overhead income brought about by‘
changes in federal cost accounting
regulations known-as Circular A-21.
He went on to -say that the.
announcement of the increases at
this time provides students a chance
to secure the money needed for the

fall. He also noted the opportunities
for various grants and scholarships
available to students affected by the
tuition will increase.

Pitt Chancellor Wesley Posvar
defended the proposed budget, say-
ing that salary increases were vital to
retain quality faculty.

Last year’s budget of $344.8 mil-
lion appears significantly smaller
than the proposed $383.4 for next
year, Freeman explained, because
the university took over manage-
ment of the Falk Ciinicgfrom the
University Health Center of Pitts-
burgh last July.

Board member A.E. Lawson, a
Federal Mine Safety Commissioner,
was the only one to speak out
against the tuition increases.-

Lawson said that tuition hikes
amounting to 8 percent over the last
eight years will “make Pitt less com-
petitive. Indeed, our young people
will go elsewhere for education.”

This is a disadvantage for the
state, Lawson said, because the new-
entry population growth necessary
for the state's economic recovery
will not occur. '

Lawson said the tuition increase
will “restrict drastically the access to
the university for the economically
disadvantaged,’ those ‘in’ economi-
cally limited situations and blacks.

“The situation is bad and it is get-
ting worse," Lawson concluded‘.
Lawson suggested a greater finan-
cial commitment to education on the
part of the state, rather than tuition
increases. -

Profs share publishing award

Professors David 1. Cleland of the School of Engineering and
William R. King of the Graduate School of Business received the
Institute of Industrial Engineers’ Joint Publishers Book-of-the Year
Award at the institute’s annual conference last Wednesday in
Chicago.

Cleland and King, both of whom came to Pitt in 1967, were
awarded the prize for their textbook, “Project Management Hand-
book," which integrates the principles of engineering management
and business management. lt is the latest of several books that they
have published together. 6

Leading geneticist hired

. Geneticist Robert E. Ferrell has been hired to come to Pitt as
professor and director ofthe human genetics program in the Graduate
School of Public Health’s department of biostatistics. Raymond
Seltser, the school's dean, announced the appointment last week and
noted that Ferre1l’s selection resulted from a nationwide search con-
ducted by a faculty committee from Pitt and Carnegie-Mellon
University. F ' 6

Ferrell comes from the University of Texas Health Science Center

' in Houston, where he was associate professor in the School of Public

Health and the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences. At Texas,
Ferrell headed the university's Genetic Marker Laboratory.

Ferrell received his undergraduate degree from Mississippi College
in Clinton and his doctorate from Texas-Austin. He will continue his
research in severalareas of human genetics relating to public health.

English prof wins l\lEA award

Pitt. faculty member Glynda Hull was chosen over applicants from
across the country for the ‘National Education\a1 Association’s
Dissertation Award for Empirical Research. Hull, of Pitt’s English
department, finished her dissertation here in 1983. The study, entitled,
“The Editing Process in Writing: A Performance Study of Experts
and Novices,“ deals with how editors locate and detect error in text.

When asked about her reaction to the award she remarked, “l was
very surprised and delighted.” Hull was not notified that she had won
until after the awards ceremony in late April. Ironically, she attended
the conference where the results were announced but did‘ not attend
the awards ceremony.

Hull will stay at Pitt for at least two more years working on
resesarch funded by the Ford Foundation. This research follows from
her earlier study. It isthe study of how computers can assist writers in
detecting errors in text. 1

, The next time you see your profes-
sor running through the streets of
Oakland, it won’t necessarily mean
he's late for class; hecould be jog-
ging as part of an employee health-
fitness program.

A recommendation that Pitt’s

0 administration work with the Uni-

versity Senate's Health and Welfare
Committee to develop a specific
proposal for the creation of such. a
program passed by a voice—vote at
Monday's meeting of the Senate
Council.

ogy professor James Holland, chair-
man of the Health and E Welfare
Committee, “and there are a number
of reports with good results.”

One variable to be worked out is
the cost of the program. Holland
cited a proposed program formu-

lated by Pitt professor of health, 

physical and recreation -education
Kenneth Metz, with an emphasis on
exercise, which projected a total of
$60-63,000 in annual operating
expenses. This program would use
existing Pitt facilities and would also
include some emphasis on smoking
and nutrition.

Holland said the program would

“A lot of the facilities are there, but facili-

ties alone do not make a program.”

-—- James Holland

According to the recommenda-

tion, the program would include:'

workshops to help university
employees quit smoking, stress-
management education, an exercise-
physiology program and exercise
stations on campus for the exclusive
use of Pitt employees.

The recommendation was
unanimously endorsed by the
Faculty Assembly two weeks ago.

“There are a number of programs
like this in industry," said psychol-
not be covered by employee insur-

ance and would have to be paid for
by the university, but in the long run,
it would save money.

“it would have to be funded by the
university,” he said. “The objective
of it, in part, is to save mone L
through it on the insurance." "

Holland said existing athletic
facilities, including those at Trees
Hall, might be used for the program.
“A lot of the facilities are there," he
said, “but facilities alone do not
make a program.“

By Mark A Sindler
Staff Writer

An apparent misunderstanding
over the formation of a new media
board for the campus radio station
has been resolved by the Student
Activities Office and the Student
Publications and Media Board.

Lee Gutkind, chairman of the
Student Publications and Media
Board —— soon to become the Stu-
dent Publications Board ~~
addressed a letter to Vice Chancellor
of Student Activities Conney M.
Kimbo April l9, voicing the board’s
concern that it was neither consulted
beforehand nor offered representa-
tion on the new board. ,

The Student Media Board will be
formed officially and its members
named within a month. Student
Activities Director Andy Smith met
with Gutkind two weeks ago and

Dispute over supervision

assured him there will be SPMB
representation on the new board.
Gutkind will serve as the lone repre-
sentative on what is projected to be a
nine—member board.

"We are not debating the action
you have taken  but we are disap-
pointed in the manner in which it
was done,” Gutkind wrote Kimbo,
 we were assured  that we would
be consulted long before such an
action was taken, so that we could
have some input into the structure of
the Media Board. We were also
assured that we would have repre-
sentation on this new board.

“Neither consulting us, or involv-
ing us not only diminishes the value
of our contributions in the past, but
demonstrates a lack of appreciation
of how our knowledge and expe-
rience might benefit Student Media
in the future."

.4-

Although Kimbo, who has not
replied to Gutkind's letter. refuses to
directly answer questions regarding
the letter, he said there was never an
attempt to undercut the old board's
integrity.

“I don’t mind taking credit for
initiating formation of the new
media board,” Kimbo said. “but I
also don't sit in my office and make
decisions as if from a vacuum.

“I inevitably have to make a deci-
sion on behalf of the radio station
because something is needed for it.
The guidelines are different. They
can be quite time-consuming.”

The station, currently WPGH
AM64, received its PM license last
September and will switch dials
starting this Fall. The problems of
obtaining more money and meeting
FCC regulations, the administration

i thought, could be dealt with better

;. .,

by a new media board.

Gutkind, who is an associate pro-
fessor of English. said that the Office
of Student Activities meant all along
to have a representative from the
SPMB on the new Student Media
Board. and that Smith clarified that
two weeks ago.

“We were miffed more than any-
thing else," Gutkind added.

Although Gutkind said that both
representation on, and consultation
concerning, the new board are
equally important, another member
of the former board hopes that stu-
dent involvement does not suffer in
the future.

“I personally will tell you -- and
this is not from the board — that my
continuing concern, [is that] insofar
as it is possible, the new operation be
of and for students while recogniz-
ing the university's greater responsi-

of WPC—3Hsett|es

bility to its own community and the
community at large," said Evan Pat-
tak, Warner Cable's Director of
Public Relations.

While wanting to downplay “the
whole issue," Pattak considers the
vitality of student involvement most
important.

“The most important piece from
the board's view is there's now
representation," said Pattak, in his
third year with the SPMB. "lt’s my
hope that students are considered to
be the primary force.

“There is no one specific issue I'm
talking about. As you look around
at other student-operated media
operations, other people want to gef
involved, which I think is great, as
the station transcends university
boundaries. Will student involve-
ment be the same as before? That I
believe is the key issue.” i

Straight from the bowels of
the south, Fervor is a collection
of seven country-rock tunes
laced together and packaged as
something totally new. How-
ever, aside from a rousing cover
of Dylan’s “Absolutely Sweet

A pleasant Nashville twang

HUMAN RACING
Nik Kershaw
MCA

Amazing how American
bands are continually derided
with the tag “faceless” while the
U.K. continues .to spit out per-
formers like Nike Kershaw.
Maybe there is some explana-
tion for “Wouldn’t It Be Good”
slipping into. the British Top
Five, but Human Racing going
Top Ten? So much for English
taste; America beware.

This album makes all the pas-
sive moves at the same old items

number of U.K. acts (impending
nuclear doom, cults, power

ages to be something worse than
run-of-the—mill garbage. Beyond
tedious lyrics, this record offers
unaffecting vocals, weird noises
and even a chorus of singing
chimpmunks in order that you
might consider all of the world's
ills in a more seriouslight. Abso-
lutely annoying.

And so it came to pass that Hol-
lis’ Roxy-esque vocals would

The superior quality of this lp

makes other recording artists
listen, shake their heads, spit on
the ground and say “damn.”.A
pop-synth dance number par
excellence.

Working in splashes of
trumpet, acoustic guitar (by way
of newly christened Pretender

interesting electronic noise-

BOP GIRL
Pai Wilson
Warner Brothers

Although this debut record
from Pat Wilson is billed as a
“specially priced, five-cut mini
album,” the obvious intent ofthe
package is nothing more than an
excuse for the stateside release of
Wilson’s Top Five Australian
hit, “Bop Girl.” The title cut is
built on a spongy guitar riff and
syncopated drum beat that
attempts to recall the heyday of
surf music and doo-wop.

In spite of the fact that Ms.
Wilson and her husband Ross
went so far as to hire ex-Beach
Boy Ricky Faatar as the record’s
co-producer, the whole effort
comes off far more contrived
than inspired. At first, I won--
dered why the jacket of this
record didn’t list any of the musi-
cians who play on the album —
then I listened to it....

MIRROR MOVES
Psychedelic Furs
CBS

‘Advanced notice of the Psy-
chedic Furs’ latest lp, by way of
the wonderful single “The Ghost
In You,” seemed to indicate that
more good things were ahead for
the band who captured so many
first time listeners with their last
album, Forever Now.

Unfortunately, the magic
created by the Furs’ rainy day
romantic intentions on “The
Ghost In You,” fails to hold all
the way through the bands latest
effort, Mirror Moves. Although

THE PSYCHEDELIC FURS

lead vocalist Richard Butler’s
incomparable asthmatic whine is
seductive on occasion, the album
lacks the instrumental punch
that the Furs require to entice
listeners. Although Mirror
Moves has its noteworthy
moments, too often the sound on
this record is ofa singer that isn’t
very good and a band that isn’t
much better. The Psychedelic
Furs are nothingshort of mes-
merizing when they achieve the
r-ight mix of intriguing instru-
mentation and compelling lyrics.
Mirror Moves offers little of
either.

REPO MAN.

The Original Motion Picture
Soundtrack —

San Andreas Records

Although Los Angeles has

long been known for its spraw-

ling suburbs /and diverse life-
styles, toolittle attentipn has
been given to the city’s dynamic
music scene. Not only has L.A.
produced a great deal of this
country’s outstanding music, but
it boasts a wonderfully fertile
underground as well. Here on
Repo Man, after Iggy Pop’s
skin-crawling title track, is an

exciting sampling of that under-
ground, which has already pro-
duced the likes of X, Los Lobos
and Dream Syndicate.

Although Suicidal Tenden-
cies’ “Institutiona1ized,” Fear’s
“Let’s Have a War” and Black
Flag’s “TV Party” stand out, the
entire album is worthwhile for
the way in which it captures
L.A.’s seminal club sounds with-
out compromising for the sake
of the punks, the psychedelics or
any one movement. Repo Man
has it all, and it’s all worth
hearing. '

By Nick Bonesso
Staff Writer

Delightfully hokey from its
myth—making beginning to its
cataclysmic end, The Natural,
starring Robert Redford, is a
heart-warming treat for all types
of movie goers.

In a prologue set 16 years
prior to the action of the film, we
see Redford’s Roy Hobbs carve
a bat out of a tree hit by light-
ning, autograph is “Wonder
Boy” and set out for a tryout
with the Chicago Cubs. His goal:
“To be the best there ever was.”

Hobbs never made it to the
tryout, but instead, he shows up
16 years later to carry the New
York Knights on a chase for the
pennant. Nothing or no one can
stop him on his quest to be the
best; as sports columnist Max

Mercy (Robert Duvall) says,
“Hobbs can do whatever he
wants with the ball.” And so he
does. Hobbs shatters clocks,
cameras and the financial
dreams of Robert Prosky and
Darren McGavin with Wonder
Boy in his hands.

With the action set in 1939,
Redford is charming in his por-
trayal of Roy Hobbs, who
doesn’t get a chance with the
Knights until mid-season, when
the team is mired in last place.
The rookie, who is by now in his
mid-30s, turns the season
around for the Knights and leads
them into the thick of the pen-
nant race, culminating with a
final game showdown with the
Pittsburgh Pirates for the title.

The season, the team’s future
and the worth of Hobbs’ life
come down to the bottom of the
ninth, two outs, two runs behind

ENTERTAINMENT/T HE PITT NEWS, SUMMER MAGAZINE/ PAGE 5

Redford makes it back fo The big leagues

and two strikes on the Knights’
miracle man.

Daring in its reliance on
cliche, The Natural works
because it is so unabashedly
emotional. Sure, it’s predictable
once you establish the roles of
the characters, but the predicti-
bility is fun because of the way
the movie turns out.

A problem with The Natural,
as with most period films, is that
it is hard for an audience in 1984
to accept the ‘ideals that the
movie presents. Sickened with
the likes of some oftoday’s base-
ball stars, it might be difficult to
believe that Roy Hobbs would
be willing to risk his life, finan-
cial wealth and personal embar-
rassment just to try to win the
pennant for Coach Wilfred
Brimsley.

An excellent cast certainly
plays a part in strengthening the

room, which aids in develop-
ing the time element and
transitions of the film.

The film’s main emphasis is
on characterization, with the
actors’ roles receiving much
attention, through both their
dialogue and their presence.
Frequently, scenes rely on
expressions to interpret what
was going on beneath the
character’s surface. Gibson,
who barely said a word in
Mad Max and The Road
Warrior, has plenty to say in
the role of Christian.

The f"1lm’s most riveting
moment is when Gibson
decides to take the ship.
Afraid yet determined, Gib-
son embodies a host of emo-
tions that strikingly convey

' the agony of the situation
with which he is faced. In

doing so, he places us precar-

swaying of the calm waters
was matched with soft, waver-
ing symphonies; the harsh,
brutal "beatings of the subor-
dinate seamen crescended
with muted, fuming music.

One may be disappointed
with the end, but even film-
makers do not like to change
history completely. The
Bounty tells an epic story
and, in the process, makes for
a great movie.

  Jobs cure summertime blues

By Lisa B. Keer
Senior Editor

It’s that time of year again, when
college students take time away
from school and set out in search of
that elusive prize — a summer job.
Because many employers avoid hir-
ing students who will be going back
to classes in September, it can be a

frustrating time for the collegiate

job-seeker.

Asked what he’d do if he didn‘t
have a summerjob, Pittjunior Louis
Felder said, ‘‘I’d just lie on the
beach.” Felder will be working in a
restaurant this summer and, like
most of his fellow Pitt students, will
not have the luxury of choosing not

" to work.

Cheryl Esposito, also ajunior, has
filed 30 applications with area firms
but has had only three interviews. “I
almost had one job," she said, but
explained that the employer was
reluctant to hire her when he could
hire other applicants who would
continue working full-time in the
fall.

Esposito, like 4,000 other stu-
dents, is registered with the universi-
ty's Student Employment Office.
Julia Laird, Pitt’s student employ-
ment coordinatortsaid one-fourth
of those registered with the office are
seeking summer work ending in
August‘. Most students are looking
for full-time work, she said.

Last year, the employment office
registered L200 students seeking

Hiiagen-Dazs,

summeriobs and placed only l08 of
them in jobs. Laird described it as an
“exceptionally bad summer” and
pointed out that this total represents
only those students who found work
through her office, reported back to
her and worked only until the fall
semester began. “Job—wise, we are
ahead thus far,” she said. but
explained that it is too early to give
exact totals.

For some students, the need for a
summer job is even more pressing.
One junior, who asked not to be
identified, said she may not be able
to afford to continue her education
full-time in the fall. “I can’t believe
the number of people applying for
minimum—wage jobs," she said after
canvassing area retailers. “No one’s
hiring."

Laird echoed this sentiment when
she listed some of the jobs the
employment office has on file. Many
are in fast food resturaunts or
require clerical skills, while others
are classified as “odd” or involve
physical labor. Ninety to 95 percent
of those listings were simply phoned
in to her office, she said.

However, the Student Employ-
ment Office also gets its share of
choice positions, Laird added.
Those jobs are often with area cor-
porations like Rockwell Interna-

 

tional or Aetna Life Insurance and
pay students, or “interns”as they are
called, approximately $1,200 ‘over
the course of the summer.

According to Laird, the typical
interviewer from one of these firms
will see l4 students in one day, but as
many as 30 may try to schedule
appointments. Those falling outside
the cut-off point are put on a waiting
list for interviews, she said, but their
resumes are given to the employer,
and they are also considered for the
position. So far this summer, five or
six students have landed trainee
jobs, Laird said. .

Undergraduates are not the only
members of the Pitt community
looking for summer work. John
Repko graduated in April with a
degree in industrial engineering. He
has a job lined up for the fall but
wants “to stay around” Pittsburgh.

The Student Employment Office
has given Repko about l0 leads so
far. He is relying solely on the Pitt
office and friends’ connections, he
said, but will take anything offering
“a decent wage." He added, “I think
they [the Student Employment
Office] do an excellent job.”

Other graduating seniors have
turned to Pitt’s Placement Office.
Director Robert Hopkins
explained, “We can’t work with a
student to find employment, but we
will help him in a one—on—one situa-
tion." Hopkins has also assisted
faculty spouses but stressed that his
office is primarily for those under-
graduates seeking career-oriented
employment.

Laird’s advice to students looking
for summer work: use classified
advertisements and friends’ connec-
tions to find a job. Mike Acquaviva
of the Pennsylvania Job Service
office in Pittsburgh agrees. He said,
however, that “not as many” stu-
dents use the services his office
provides.

The Pennsylvania Job Service
operates a “referral system” similar

Ll When Warday fa

to Pitt’s for all types of jobs,
although Acquaviva stressed that
the majority of these positions are at
the entry level. The office does not
charge a fee for its services and is
open to all.

Acquaviva said it is important to
note that “Z0 years ago, many stu-
dents found manufacturing jobs,
mostly through connections.” He
continued, “We have found that the
most effective method is personal
contact —— the door-to—door in your
neighborhood."

Michael Boyd, a senior, agreed
with Acquaviva’s assessment. “It's
who you know,” he said, explaining
that he will be working for Coleco
this summer, a position he found
through his father. While the firm
preferred a permanent employee, he
said, they have a high enough turn-
over rate to allow him to work full-
time this summer. Boyd said that
based on what his friends were going
through to find summerjobs, things
are “tough all over.”

One student, who asked not to be
identified, said he has been looking
for a job since the second week of
April. He thinks he has hit upon the
optimal solution to temporary
unemployment. “I tell them I'll work
in the fall, even if I won’t."

LUCILLE B. CROZIER

V Civic Leader "
Has sewed as a trustee.since 1971 and emeri-
tus trustee since 1977

Crozier majored in English and education at Pitt
and graduated in 1934. She is a past president of
the Pennsylvania Medical Auxiliary Society, the

College Club of Pittsburgh and the Pennsylvania ~

State Division of the American» Association of

University Women ~ which honored her with the

establishment of the Lucille B. Crozier Fellowship
for medical study.

1 She is president of the Womens’Association of
the university and was the first woman president of
the University Alumni Council. A former trustee
of the Child Guidance Clinic, she is the former
director of the Soho Community House. Crozier

had served for nine years on the Board of Health /

and Welfare. She is a Distinguished Daughter of
Pennsylvania, member of the National Associa-
tion of Parliamentarians and has served as parlia-
mentarian for the American Medical Association
Auxiliary and the Pennsylvania Medical
Auxiliary. »

Crozier has done extensive research on the
,history of Pitt’sSchool of Medicine, and she
expressed interest and concern over the recent
changes in administration and the turmoil
that surrounded it. '

‘ She described her relationship with Pitt as
“faithful and loyal," and she added that “Pitt
‘is doing a great job educating young people,
and I hope it will continue.“ '

.Crozier said the question of tuition
increases is “crucial" and agreed that Pitt
must lobby the state harder. “We are a state-
related school, and the thrust is to get more
money from the state,” she said.

Although her personal interests lie with the
medical school, she said the university should
not lose sight of the importance of the arts and
humanities. She said that Provost Richard
Benjaminhas good ideas, and she described
his planning process as a crucial part of the
new direction of the university. Crozier
stressed that Pitt “cannot be narrow.”

She called her relationship with students
good, saying, “I do not feel detached‘ at all.”

She attends all the functions to which stu-
dents invite her, she said, and. refers their
concerns to board members.

“I think the student representative is doing
a very good job,” she added.

Crozier defended the role of the board, say-

, ing that the very size of the university requires

that its organization be put into the hands of
the experts. 7

“Trust the powers that be that all are prop-
erly treated,” she said.

As for her experience as a female member
of the board, Crozier said. “I never felt dis-
criminated against —- my ideas were accepted
as anyone else‘s. For a while. I was the only
woman on the board  now there are a
number of women on the board, and this core

is a credit to the university."

C. HOLMES WOLFE, JR.

Reed. Smith, Shaw & McCIay law firm. partner
Charter Trustee. Has served since 1966

Wolfe, an alumnus of the University of Pitts-
burgh Law School, has been practicing law in
Pittsburgh since being admitted to the bar in I 950.

’ He was born in Pittsburgh and attended Shady

Side Academy, Milton Academy in Massachusetts
and Harvard College, where he earned a bachelor
of arts degree in 1942. ‘

Wolfe stresses the need for a strong liberal
arts education to accompany the surge into
the high-tech ﬁelds. ‘

“The university has the obligation to pro-
vide an A-l liberal arts education to the peo-
ple in the region of this commonwealth."

“The board has a legitimate interest also 
encouraging the chancellor to explore new

ways to develop ‘the high-tech aspects of edu- '

cation,” Wolfe said. ,

Hepsaid that such exploration involves an
ecomonic component — tuition to pay for it
-— and Wolfe called this relationship between
tuition increases and the qualityof education
a “necessary evil.” He added that the chancel-
lor does a “good job in Harrisburg” securing
necessary state funding. V

Wolfe said that his interplay with students
is limited byfthe nature of the position.

“All trustees feel their doors are open to the
students,” he said, “all of this-on the under-
standing that the board has the chancellor as

its speaker — the chancellor speaks for the -

board, and no chancellor worth his weight
would tolerate interference from the board in
matters having to do with the staff or faculty.”

He said the board is interested but cannot
play a role in solving problems -— it can only
encourage the chancellor.

Wolfe said that the university faces an enor-
mously challenging future and that the indi-

vidual board members are involved in that

challenge.

“I am able to play a role, and I find that
enormously satisfying,” he said. “I give up a
hell of a lot. I'm a lawyer and give up time for
the university.”

THOMAS J. HAJDUK
Commonwealthirustee term 1982 to 1986

Hajduk, 32, is the only student onthe Board of
Trustees and the third in Pitt's history. A first- year
graduate student in the international affairs pro-
gram of Pitt's Graduate School of Public and
International Affairs, he graduated from the Col-
lege of General Studies last August with a B.A. in
philosophy and media communications.

Hajduk was initially appointed in I980 to
complete another board members term as a
commonwealth trustee by Governor Richard
Thornburgh. Two years later, he was reap-
pointed to a full term_of his own’.

“I went through a process of seven inter-

» views before I was appointed by the governor.

\

I think it’s important that there be a student
on the board. The governor is not required to
appoint a student among his four common-
wealth trustees. It’s entirely up to him, but it’s
a tradition in Pennsylvania and in most
states.” 1

Does Hajduk represent Pitt students in his
role as trustee? “This board has no representa-
tion. The lawyers do not represent law, the
faculty members do not represent faculty, the
businessmen do not represent business, and I
do not represent students. Every trustee is to

act in the broadest interest of the university, T

But I do think I bring a student’s perspective,
and I think it is a different perspective from
those of ‘the other board members.

“I have an advantage, I think, because I'm
on campus all the time. I interact with faculty
and students as well as with my colleagues on
the board. I have a unique perspective.”

ALFREDH E. LAWSON

Commissioner of Federal Mine Safety Health
Review Commission

Commonwealth Trustee term from 1981 to
1985

Has been trustee since 1969

Lawson earned his Bachelor of Arts degree as a
full-time evening student at Pitt. He majored in
economics, graduating magna cum laude_ and Phi
Beta Kappa. He completed his law degree at Har-
vard in I 95 7 and practiced for four years in New

York before returning to Pittsburgh. Until

October 1978, he was an attorney with the United

Steelworkers of America. He is now serving a six-

year term on the Federal Mine Safety and Health
« Review Commission.

Lawson was formerly vice chairman of the
Democratic Party in Mt. Lebanon. He also served
on the Governors Tax Study and Pension Com-
mission and the Governor's Commission on Prior-
ities. He has served as a director of the
Pennsylvania ACLU. I

Lawson feels strongly about tuition and its
impact on education. He has opposed tuition

increases at Pitt- for the past I 1 years. “Its just '

something I do after years of experience,” he

an institution for the elite won’t solve the
dilemma of providing quality education.”

Lawson cited his personal and professional
background as the assets he brings to the
Board of Trustees. He does not feel detached
from the student body, either.

“I bring expertise to the board with my
labor background. At the same time, I am a
Pitt graduate, but one knowledgable of how
hard it may be for some students to go to

improve.”

MERLE E. GILLIAND ,
Board chairman and chief executive officer,
Pittsburgh National Bank ,

Charter Trustee. Has served as a trustee since
1969 '

Gilliand, who is also chairman of the university
budget committee, trustee on Duquesne Universi-
ty ’s Board of Trustees and on the Board of Visitors
of Pitt is Graduate School of Business, joined Pitts-
burgh National Bank after serving on Duquesne's

faculty as an accounting instructor. He was elected
assistant. comptroller in 1954 and worked his way
up to his present position in 1972.

Gilliand was born in Pitcairn and was valedicto-
rian at Pitcairn High School. He served in the
United States Arm y from I 942 to 1946 and earned
a bachelor's degree in business administration

from Duquesne. ,

Gilliand is a member of the Advisory Council of
Duquesneis School of Business and Administra-
tion, the Bank Administration Institute, Financial
Executive Institute and the Pennsylvania Institute
of Certified Public Accountants. L

He is a director of Pittsburgh National Corpora-
tion, Pittsburgh Opera, Pennsylvania Economy

Leagues, Bell Telephone of Pennsylvania, Pitts-
burgh Theological Seminary and Cooper Tire and
Rubber Company.

Gilliand said inflation is the primary reason
tuition has risen the “past 10 years.

“No one likes to see tuition increase,” he
said, “but salariesihave to be paid. It’s a ser-
vice industry and must pay what is considered
the going wage to keep a good faculty.”

He said he hopes alumni will continue to .

contribute to the university and that gradu-

ates should give back to the university that

gave them their education.

Gilliand also said the university’s direction
will have an important place on the universi-
ty’s agenda in addition to questions on neces-
sary changes the university’s curriculum.

Since he is chairman of the Budget Com-
mittee, Gilliand said he has the experience to
ask necessary questions on budgetary
matters.

Gilliand said it is important for the trustees
to understand what student needs are. He
added that the trustees do work with the stu-
dents on occasion. .

RUGGERO J. ALDISERT

US. Circuit Judge, for Third Circuit Court of

peals
Charter Trustee. Has served as a trustee since
1968.

Aldisert received both his undergraduate and
law degrees from the University of Pittsburgh, in
1941 and 1947, respectively. He began his profes-
sional career as a trial lawyer in Pittsburgh and, in
1961, was promoted to the Common Pleas Court
bench. Aldisert was appointed U.S. Circuit Judge
in 1968. As an adjunct professor of law at the
university, Aldisert has ‘served as a part-time
faculty member since 1965. »

When the Honorable Ruggero J. Aldisert
came to the University of Pittsburgh as a
freshman in 1937, little did he realize it would
be a lifetime commitment.

Aldisert continued at Pitt as a graduate

student and an active member of the Alumni

Association, then later as a part-time profes-
sor in the law school. Now, in addition to his
job as a United States Circuit~.Iudge, he is a
charter member of the Board of Trustees. --
“It’s been one of the great experiencesvof my
lifetime,” Aldisert saidabout his position on
the board.\ He is "chairman of the Planning

' Committee and has been chairman of the Stu- .

dent Affairs ‘Committee since 1968.

“Over the years, I've gotten to know the
student leadershippand the students’ prob-
lems,” he said. These problems have changed
during his years in that position, ranging from

dormitory visitation-policy questions to suffi-

cient seating at football games.
Recent issues have included matters con-
cerning residential life and questions about

, activities fees. The graduate and professional

students are now forming a movement to raise
their activities fee so there will be increased
funding for events. 1

Fees are one province of the board, and
Aldisert called his committee “the ears of the
students on the board.”

Tuition is not a matter of the Student
Affairs Committee, but Aldisert has opinions
about who is to blame for recent tuition hikes.

“The criticism should lay at the legislative
branch,” he said. “I feel the Pennsylvania
legislature does not support the institutions of
higher learning enough, and I think that the
resulting tuition for in-state students in this
state is decidedly higher than what students
pay in other states."

A conflict of interest between his work as a
judge and his position on the Board of Trus-
tees is a possibility; thus Aldisert disqualiﬁes
himself whenever Pitt appears before his
court in litigation. ._

Referring to new projects at the university,
such as the renewed relationship with
Carnegie-Mellon University for the Pitts-
burgh Cancer Institute and the Campus of the
Future project, Aldisert said, “We're just at
the threshold of things to come.”

Darryl Shepherd

Rebounding from basketball
no hurdle for Pitt sophomore

By Charlle O'Hara
Senior Editor

About six weeks ago, Pitt sopho-
more Darryl Shepherd had com-
pleted what was considered a
disappointing basketball season. He
averaged 1.2 points and 0.7
rebounds injust 56 minutes all year.

Disappointment followed disap- A

pointment. Three weeks later, a
hamstring pull —— possibly the worst
injury a hurdler can sustain -
slowed his progress.

On Saturday, Shepherd became a
national title contender in the ll0-
meter high hurdles, but remains first
a basketball player.

The Peabody High graduate
covered the ten 42-inch high hurdles
in 13.5 seconds at the l4th annual
Pitt Outdoor Invitational. His time
—- better than two-time NCAA
champion Roger Kingdom’s best at
Pitt Stadium -— was a stadium
record and NCAA qualifying time.

But Shepherd has not lost sight of

his reason for transferring from

Duquesne two years ago: basketball.
He said and meant that he did not
expect too much from himself in
basketball until he got the system
down.

He says that now he has the sys-
tem down pat and expects better
things in the future. Despite the per-
sonal hardships of last season, he
still wants to become a “total Pitt
basketball player.”

“Everybody kept coming up to me
during the season asking mewhy l’m

not playing,” Shepherd said. “When
1 came to Pitt, I put all my trust in
the coaching staff. I have to believe
in them.

“Its difficult when you’re not
playing but you have to keep work-
ing. When you get to the point where
you’re doing what Coach [Roy]
Chipman has in mind for you as.a
player, then he’ll play you.

“I have a lot of goals that I still can
achieve in basketball. I feel humbly
that I can be the best in basketball..I
know that I can run track for the rest
of my life. Right now basketball is
my No. 1 priority.”

Aside from basketball and track,
Shepherd fiddles with the clarinet,
saxophone, guitar, flute, piano and
most recently, the synthesizer. His
major is computer science, his minor
is music. He wants to incorporate
the two”.

“He's very sincere in whatever
interests him,“ said his mother,
Saundra Shepherd. “He’s very disci-
plined. He understands that he‘s a
student in all areas and that he's
learning. I really think that he‘s com-
ing of age now.”

To Pitt track coach John Vasvary,
Shepherd’s performance on the
track was no big surprise.

A year ago, Vasvary watched
another sophomore rebound from
another sport to excellence inn
track. Roger Kingdom followed
spring football drills by winning the
NCAA ll0-meter hurdles cham-
pionship, defeating Willie Gault of
Tennessee. M‘

Kingdom.\was defeated by only
three competitors during the out-
door season: Villanova’s Rodney
Wilson, a national champion and
four-time All-America; Gault, the
world’s third-ranked hurdler and an
NCAA indoor champion; and Shep-
herd, a seldom-used Pitt basketball
player. -

“I believe that Shep can come
back from Nationals as an All-
America,” Kingdom said. “He's got
a shot at winning it, like I did. [came
out of nowhere. No one knew who I
was last year."

Kingdom mentioned Cletus Clark

. of Houston and Tony Dees of Mis-

sissippi as Shepherd's competition.
Clark has already run a l3.4l, tops
among collegiates.

Shepherd will run in the Intercol-
legiate Amateur Athletic Associa-
tion of America championships this
weekend at Princeton. The NCAA
track and field championships fol-
low from May 28-June 2 at Eugene,
Oregon.

.“The times that he's run have
come without the practices that he's

needed,” said Steve Lewis, the sprint-

and hurdle coach at Pitt.

“What he's doing right now is run-
ning on his talent — that's a lot of
raw talent. That’s the type of talent
he has. His talent as a hurdler has
not even been tapped and the only
guys who have beaten him this year
are NCAA and Olympic trial
qualiﬁers.”

On Saturday, Shepherd defeated

Boseboll ‘ream ends season
with 9-8 loss To Penn Store

By Scott Dellelt
Staff Writer

This is an image of perfect base-
ball weather: The sun beaming
down, shining over the entire field
with temperature warm enough so
spectators can enjoy a close game
between two rivals while working on
a tan and an Iron City.

The game was there at Trees Field
yesterday —— Penn State edged Pitt,
9-8 '— but the climate was suited for
a gridiron matchup betweenthe two
schools. The wind was sweeping
across the playing ﬁeld, chilling fans
and players alike. If there were con-
cession stands, the big sellers would
have been hot chocolate and coffee.

This scene is not uncommon in
college baseball in the Northeast.
While their Southern and Western
counterparts are able to play 60 to 80
games a year, many coaches in this
region spend the last two months
rescheduling rainouts, only to find
that the weather rarely cooperates
with their plans.

Frustration is the word com-
monly used to describe the feelings
of coaches and players alike, who
would like nothing more than to go
out on a baseball diamond and play.

“Over the years, l’ve accepted the
fact that the weather .can’t be
changed,” said Pitt head coach

' Bobby Lewis, who saw 20 rainouts

this season. “It’s not the winning or
losing games that frustrating, it’s the
rainouts.”

Penn State coach Shorty Stoner
echoed those sentiments. Even
though the Nittany Lions were able
to get 41 games in, the conditions
«were at times not ideal for baseball.

“We had to reschedule games four
and five times this year,” he said.
“Last year, we had l4 consecutive

weekends with rain, but this spring,
we only had two to seven nice days.

This year had last year beat."

It is the players who bear the most
anguish out of the saturation. For
example, the Panthers had a week
off towards the latter stages of the
season.

“It was two weeks since l’ve last
pitched,” Panther hurler Frank
Craska said. “You get pumped up to
start, but a half hour before game
time or the night of the game, it
rains.”

“It was nice for a couple weeks,
and we were getting into a groove,"
Panther leftfielder Ken DiBucci
said. “Then you are inside for a week
and you have to get back into the
groove.”

The problem is the amount of
practice time. During the winter
months, indoor workouts are bene-
ficial, but after a team plays out-
doors they prefer to stay there.

“Once I‘m outside, Idon’t like to
get back in the [indoor] cage,”
DiB.ucci said. “The cage is helpful
before the first time outdoors, but
when you start playing outside, you
don’t want to go back."

“There is a difference fielding
grounders off a field compared to a
gym floor,” Pitt shortstop Paul
Westwood said.’

The weather has ‘an adverse effect
on a pitcher’s workout.

“You try to throw on the side dur-
ing rainouts, but you can’t throw
hard because you don’t know if
you're going to play until game-
time,” Pitt pitcher Aaron Krause
said. .

“You can get your first and second
pitchers some work, but a team
doesn’t use their third, fourth or fifth
pitchers,” Stoner said.

Yesterday’s cold, windy condi-

tions were not beneficial to a pitcher.

“The weather does have an
effect,” said Krause, who gave up six
runs in five innings yesterday. “The
cold and the wind in my face took a
little off my fastball. With warmer
weather, I could have loosened up
quicker.” ’

A proposal by Old Dominion
coach Mark Newman would benefit
the North as far as achieving parity
in baseball. Newman would like the
NCAA to start the season in April
and run it into June, holding the
College World Series at the end of
June.

“It would benefit us,” Stoner said.
“We can play in ideal weather, and
enable us to recruit better.

“Baseball is a growing sport in
college, but now it’s awfully tough
for a northern team to win. Right
now, athletic directors have an
excuse to cut our budget. We have
no way near the [l 3] scholarships the
NCAA allows for baseball.”

“I would love the season to go into
June,” Krause said. “The weather
starts to break in May and you get to
play more. With the proposal, you
know you will get to play 40 games
in a 40-game schedule.”

The proposal would also help
northern schools get into the NCAA
playoffs. In 1981, Pitt compiled a
25-8 mark, but since they had not
played enough games, they were not
invited to post-season play.

“Independents are put into a pool

‘during playoff selection time,”

Lewis said. “In 1981, we had to go
against Miami, with a 56-19 record,
and Stanford, with a 40-20 record.
The number of games played is
impressive, and we are at a
disadvantage.”

SPORTS/THE PITT NEWS SUMMER MAGAZ|NE/ PAGE 13

Panther reserves undaunted by recruits

Contrary to public opinion, the
sight of smiling mentors ushering
incoming freshmen Charles Smith,
Demetreus Gore and Eugene Lewis
about this campus does not have Pitt

basketball players shaking in their‘

hightops.

If anyone should be shivering, it’s
the recruits, judging by the com-
ments ofjunior guard Joey David.

“l’ve been here two years, and
there isn’t any way any of these
recruits are going to come in and
take away my playing time,"he said.

The Panthers faced a similar
dilemma last season, when Coach
Roy Chipman had difficulty squeez-
ing his I6 players into the five open-
ings on the court.

In a nutshell, sophomore Jeff
Robinson, who called Chipman “a
liar" in a reporter‘s microphone, and
Charles Thompson, who encoun-
tered academic hardships, were sus-
pended from the team. Bryan
Mitchell became rusty from inactiv-
ity and left for Rhode Island.

But what of the four local basket-
ball players who signed letters of
intent with the hometown school
some years back with dreams of
playing in the Big East conference,
only to discover the best seats in the

 

Field House — the bench.

What will become of Joey David
(7.l minutes per game), Matt Mik-
lasevich (3.1), Darryl Shepherd ( I .8)
and Marlon Ferguson ( I .0) when the
best recruiting class in Pitt history
invades Oakland?

Shepherd could always fall back
on hurdling 42-inch high horizontals
over a I10-meter distance M he
managed to do such in 13.5 seconds
last weekend at the Pitt Invitational
and qualified for the NCAA cham-
pionships —- but he won’t.

“I feel I have so much ofan advan-
tage," Shepherd said. “I would hate
to be in-their shoes. It's such a big
change from high school to college.
You have to do so many new things

PRESS BOX
Joe Zett

that you almost forget how to play
basketball.”

Shepherd’s memory was not
really tested last season, playingjust
over a minute a game. He said the
new recruits should expect much of
the same.

“In high school, people come up
to you as if you’re Mr. Everything.
But here, everybody’s scored 40
points in a game.

“You have to make the transition
to a new living style and a new
coaching style, and only a handful of
freshmen in the country can do it.”

As for Miklasevich, he can rely on
two Big East confrontations with
Georgetown, against whom he is
annually called upon to challenge
Patrick Ewing.

o

The 6-6 sophomore earned almost
a third ofhis playing time last season
~ 3| of 95 minutes —- against the
Hoyas.

“It's a lot different from high
school,” said the Panthers’ blond-
haired brick wall.

“No one ever gets hit in high
school. It‘s a physical game here. It’s
not toned down like high school.
College is a lot more half-court
basketball."

Miklasevich will conflict directly
with the recruits, as will Keith Arm-
strong, Andre Williams, Chip Wat-
kins, Ferguson and Shepherd for the
forward and center positions.

“It's really gonna be hurting
underneath,” said David. “There’s
so many people. There could be a lot

of problems there.”
Miklasevich, however, remains
confident. '
“That's gonna be a scrap," he said.

'“But it‘s based on the individual.

Clyde came in here [as a freshman]
and jumped on a chance, but you
really can’t tell. You really can’t
forecast something like that. So
many things can happen."

David can attest to that. He said
this year's situation is unlike last
years, which has left him somewhat
bitter.

“lt’s not like these guys have been
promised playing time or anything. I
didn’t like it when Curtis [Aiken]
said in the papers that he was prom-
ised playing time last year.‘ _

“If I had known that, then I
wouldn't have keptlmy mouth shut
as much as I did. Things would have
been different."

Last season, George Allen won
the second guard position opposite
Billy Culbertson and Aiken at point
guard.

Aiken, who came to Pitt with sta-
tistics just as flashy as those of Gore
and Smith, played 200 more minutes
than David as a reserve.

“It takes a lot more in college than
in high school. You can go by the
Curtis Aiken situation,” said Mik-
lasevich. “Billy stayed at point guard
all season. You can tell by that."

Take note, heralded freshmen.

This disadvantage could be coun-

Big East baseball conference. The
proposal is scheduled to be voted on

by the conference athletic directors_

this month.

“lt’s a bargain to belong in a con-
ference,” Stoner said. “It's the secret
to get into the NCAA playoffs."

“It creates interest and gives the
fellows something to shoot at,”
Lewis said.

“It is a positive move," Westwood

Pitt diving coach
at Olympic helm

By Barry Greene
For The Pitt News

Pitt’s diving coach, Julian Krug,
successfully coached the U.S.
National Diving Team in the Can-
ada Cup and came across the border
with a couple of personal items to
declare. I

In addition to coaching, Krug was
selected by fellow coaches to judge

‘ the U.S. Olympic Trials at‘Indiana-
polis, July 4-8, and was appointed

chairman of the Judges Certification -

and Selection Committee, a branch
of the executive body for U.S. div-

mg.

Julian Krug

The Canada Cup, held in Win-
nipeg, Manitoba, on April 27-29, is
the first of the prestigious Can-
Amex series, which features the top
finishers from the America Senior
Nationals, as well as many top divers
from Canada, Mexico, China and I 1
other competitive diving countries.
Also in the series were the American
Cup in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., on
May 3-6 and the Mexico Cup, in
Mexico City, on May I0-I3.

Coaching mostly fifth- and sixth-
place National finishers in the Can-
ada Cup, Krug’s divers Ron Merriot
and Bruce Kimball, of Kimball Div-
ers, placed second in the men’s
springboard and platform respec-
tively. Karen Gorham, of McDo-
nald's of Columbus, placed second
in women’s springboard. Their per-
formances helped to bring a second
place overall to America in the Can-
ada Cup. ‘

America then went on to Fort
Lauderdale to take a first place in
the series. I

As a three-time qualifier for the
Olympic Trials and the World Pro-
fessional Trick and Acrobatic Div-
ing Champ in 1977-78, Krug has
distinguished himself as one of
America’s best in diving and coach-
ing. Since coming to Pitt in 1980,
Krug has used excellent coaching
rather than tricks to lift the Pitt div-
ers to the top of their sport in the Big
East.

“I will definitely be there,” Krug
said after he was selected to judge
the US. Olympic Trials. For the
fourth time, Julian Krug will be
there.

for NCAAs

in hurdles

continued from page eleven

West Virginia, with little difficulty.

“When I got to the starting line I
saw this guy with a WVU shirt on,"
Shepherd recalled. “I just figured
there was no way that a guy from
WVU should beat me.

“After the race, I found out that
he had already qualified for the
NCAA meet. I was shocked. Idon’t
know what would have happened ifl
would have found that out before
the race." ~

As a hurdler and as a basketball
player, Shepherd is short on expe-
rience, the key ingredient between
confidence and being intimidated.

“He‘s come a long way in a short
time,” Vasvary said. “When he

. pulled his hamstring he ended out at

least three weeks behind in training.
We know what he is capable of
doing, he just has to get some
experience. I,

“I know one thing, when he goes
to Nationals, people are gonna think
twice when they see he’s a hurdler
from Pitt. He won't surprise
anybody.”

As far as basketball is concerned,
assistant coach Reggie Warford said
that Shepherd has a real shot at tak-
ing over at Clyde Vaughan’s old
position.

“He’s gonna play small forward,”
Warford said. “He has some boning
up to do on his ball-handling and
passing skills. He’s an exceptional
athlete and a pretty good basketball
player. He’s familiar. with the system

I now.

“I believe Darryl reflects very pos-
itively on the program as a person
and he’s doing quite well on the
track.

“It’s very difficult to say whether
he’ll be starting because the new kids
we have are multi-position players. I
like his talent, and if he improves his
ball handling during the off-season
then he’ll have a decent shot at it.”

Even if he doesn’t get the starting
nod —- his opportunity to becomea
“complete Pitt basketball player”-
Shepherd insists that he will not be
frustrated.

“Basketball is much different
from track,” Shepherd said. “Track
is more individual. I want to be a
part of a team. I’m a team person, I
think. I might not have the oppor-
tunity to play on a team like Pitt’s
again.

“Even if I don’t do well next year,
I may learn the most valuable lesson
about life."
