THE UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

S. C. Sponsors Blood Drive;
Wecht Stresses A ttendance ,

By DAVE VVINTER

Associate Editor
Student Congress,_prompted by stories of the desper-
ate need for blood in Korea, decided Monday to collect blood-
donation pledges from Pitt students.

Under Sam Shapiro’s prodding, the Congressmen pledged 
to give blood themselves when enough pledges have been_

secured to bring a Bloodmobile to the campus.
Bob Gardner introduced the idea, which has been talk-

eral groups, including IF Council
and Alpha Phi Omega, service
fraternity, without provoking ac-
tion.
‘Passed Unanimously

The motion as amended was
passed with a-few "ayes sounding
reluctant, but no nays.

Judging from the business like

‘, air generated at the ﬁrst meeting

Monday by president Cyril Wecht,
vice-president Gardner, and the
reporting committee heads, Con-

gress won't lack leadership this

year.

Gardner also pushed through a
motion which will give the SC ex-
ecutive committee (composed of
the elected otﬁcers) the power to
drop from the ranks any Congress
member who gets two unauthor-
ized absences. From now on, if an
SC member has to miss a meeting,
he mustepresent a written excuse,
in advance when possible.

Plan Called “Childish”

In discussion, Ann Curran called
the proposed system “childish,”
and added, “I like the old rule-—
that a member must miss one-
third of the scheduled meetings or-

three successive meetings before

he can be asked to resign.”

Immediately after the- motion
passed, nine to four, Wecht laid
down the law: “There are too
many cases of people not show-
ing at meetings,” he said.
“Neither 1, Bob. Sill (Green) or

Pat (Clohessy) or M a g g i e
(Dowling) want to knock off any
Congress members, But . . . ”

and other members of Congress
will have office hours in 832'Cl.
from 1:30-3:30 p.m. every Monday
to give all students a chance to
drop in and air their gripes or
suggestions. '_
SC committee chairmen whose
appointments were approved are:
Roger Bognar, ﬁrst student repre-
sentative on the Homecoming Day
committee; Jim Dunbar — Dad’s
Day; Marion Post—Chapel Service;
Nancy Tear —‘ Student-faculty-ad-
ministration “retreat,” a project
slated for next Spring; Jim Rock-
-—Student Government Clinic for
local high schools, with Pitt’s Con-
gress as guinea pig.

ECA Backs Trip

Bishop. Brown, director of the

Pitt’s Research Bureau for Retail
Training,‘ sailed Sept. 15 for
France as a representative of the
Economic Cooperation Adminis-
ltration.
— As. a member of a ﬁve-man team
for the ECA, Mr. Brown will visit
ﬁve‘ key cities in France and meet
with top management groups to
discuss economic and production
problems. He will return in early
November.

Building As

Pitt May Purchase,Mosg/tie Lot

Memorial -

in Oakland. seldom an easy

task, may become even more difﬁcult if rumors about the
coming sale of the parking lot‘ on the north side of Syria

Mosque become reality. ¢

The bright side of the parking
lot sale—which would mean the
loss of 235 parking spaces—is that
a building to be erected there may
be available for use by the Uni-
versity.

No One Talking

No one in authority could or
would say whether anyone has
actually offered to buy the lot,
bounded by Bigelow Boulevard,
Lytton Avenue and the Mosque. '

Paul L. Houston, head of the
Syria Improvement Association,
which manages the property of the
Syria Temple, declined .to make
any comment.

.Nevertheless, , the g e n e r a 1
membership of Syria Temple
will vote next Wednesday on the
question of selling the lot for
‘$170,000. \

As to what type of building may
be erected, a rumor is circulating
that a memorial building for the
Mellon family has been suggested.

Unofficial spokesmen for the
Mellon'Bank have_ described the
story as a “rumor.” _

Eyed Lot In Past ‘

But the University has been in-

terested in the property in the

past, and Richard K. Mellon -is a
member of the University Board
of Trustees. _
Speaking of former interest
here in the property, Theodore
W. Biddle, dean of men, stated.
that the University had inform-
ally considered the property as
a possible site for _a Graduate
School of Social Work building.
The price asked for the lot at the
time was prohibitive, Mr. Biddle
said. ~
The clean added that he had
heard of no more recent plans for
purchasing the property.
Neither Chancellor Rufus“ I-I.

Fitzgerald nor John Weber, sec.re- _ .

tary of the University, could be
reached for comment.

SC SECRETARIES NEEDED

Student Congress, planning
to do more letterwriting this
year, wants to set up a “secre-
tariat.” _ Students wishing to
apply for positions on the new
committee should inquire, at ,
the dean of men’s office.

6000 High Schoolers
Expected Saturday

An estimated 6,000 students

' from 400 district high schools will

be sitting on the‘Pitt side of the
Stadium on Saturday as part Of
the University’s High School Day

Enrollment.
Drop Still

Uncertain

Enrollment is going to drop
again this semester but no one is
sure exactly how far.

Registrar J. G. Quick has only ‘

preliminary registration ﬁgures so

far and declined to release them,

to the News. _

An indication of the drop can be
seen, however, in the veteran’sAen-
rollment ﬁgures. Veteran’s Ad-
visor William F. Saalbach esti-
mates that between 5000 and 5500
vets are in school this year, which
compares with a 6000 ﬁgure last

year- Of these veterans, Saalbach ’
estimated that perhaps as high'as_
70 per cent are part-time students. .. F

A further indication of the_drop
can be seen in the number of
freshmen enrolled for compulsory
orientation classes. Richard A.
Cunningham, assistant to the dean
of men, lists 593 frosh in “classes
this fall, comparing with about 875
last year. .

That blaring of trumpets, tootin’
of horns and beating of drums
means that Pitt’s Varsity March-
ing Band and .Benny Benack’s
Polkats are back in school.

The Varsity band just spent four
days at Camp Kon-O-Kwee, near
Zelienople, Pa, ‘

Benack’s Polkats, a 20 piece

[ swing outﬁt, returned in time to

play their melodies for the fresh-
men banquet.

It was a great deal-of work with
little play, or a great deal of play
with a lot of work for the mem-
bers ot the Varsity Marching
Band.

Their new drillcoach, Warrant
Ofﬁcer William Hilgen, who is also
adjutant of the Army ROTC unit
on the campus, had the marching
musicians going through their
paces an hour after they arrived
at camp.

With two /rehearsals a day, one
at 9 a.m." and another at 10:30

.p.m., the Varsity Band perfected

the routines they Will, display at

They tried out their new maneu-

Colndgress Prospects Bright     s A

They have.16 members, both men and women,
they meet once a week, their president is Cyril
Wecht, and I’ll bet most of you who read this
won’t know rm referring to Student Congress.

That’s the way it is mgst of the time and it
was no exception this week as the legislators
crawled out from under the usual huge pile of
class cards and new text books to quietly begin
a new season of student government.

Things got underway officially at a well—run,

' efficient ﬁrs'L—meetin§ on Monday afternoon.

I got an indication of their plans last Friday,

’ however, when I took the night off, laid aside the

old beer mug, and sat in on a preliminary meet-
ing of Congress at Wecht’s home. in Squirrel Hill.
_There‘I leaned back and listened, squirmed a
bit at times, and tried to size up this new gang of‘
Congressmen. I’ll say this about them—they have
more pre-game enthusism, more intriguing, work-‘
able plans and ideas, and more potentialities than
any Congress ’I’ve seen since I rode my ~ﬁrst Pitt
elevator in 1948. . '
-They seem to want to do a good job and they
seem to know what they want to do.‘ That last
part, you might’ guess, is in itself comparatively
rare, but they have‘ a list of interesting projects
that’s most of a mile long. . "
First let’s take a look at two things that‘get
in their way this year. The members themselves
seem to be of. generally good quality. The exception

- there would be the women who as‘a body seem

Gotta Dime?

Few people will deny the signiﬁcance of food in

the overall scheme, of things. Fewer ‘people -still in
this land of crass'capitali"sm will care to deny the '

signiﬁcance of money. Together these two commod-.
ities form a closely integrated relationship. '

The amount and “quality of the food you con-
sume is determined by the amount of money you
expend. This is especially true in the Tuck Shops‘
and the cafeteria. However‘; there are some people\
in this University who hold that the amount of
money‘ you expend has almost nothing todo with
the quality of the food youdget. I shall not repeat
their comments. i ’

But down in the cafeteria the dollar has almost
lost its signiﬁcance. For one dollar and two. cents
($1.02)——under the a la carte system—-you can get

a hamburger, a scoop of mashed potatoes, a. scoop
of peas, one slice of bread, a pattie of butter, a bowl
of ‘soup and a cup of coffee. .

When you enumerate the items it sounds like a
lot. When they are parked on a plate in front of
you, you are not so sure. And when you get up from
the table you know that it wasn’t‘very much.

If you want to make the meal complete, you
have to pay 20 cents for a salad. or some greenery
which _has arbitrarily been called a salad. A piece
of pie adds 15 more cents toyour bill. If you have
a prediliction for pie a la mode, it will cost you ‘an
extra nickel. '

to lack something Congresswise. They are sweet‘
loveable creatures, nice to look at and nice to,
talk to, but it stops there. None of them seem 1:04
possess any strong convictions, or if they do hold
any,>they aren’t inclined to ﬁght for them. I hope
I’m wrong. . J A A _

Then, too‘, the ‘desire for recognition is a 10*
under the tunic of just about every one of the
Congressmen. They feel they aren’t appreciated
(which I'm afraid is true). A suggestion by Larry
Adler that Congress meet at least once out in 
bright daylight of the Commons Room was snap-
ped up eagerly by all present at the Friday meet-
ing.

They_ even jumped on me because they said
the Pitt News hadn’t publicized their doing!
in the past.

But the members do have plenty of good points.

to come.

 
 

 
 

 
 

That is a rough summing up of what we’re'in A
for. in the way of lawmaking and lawmakers this
year. They can be good or bad. At this early date,
Congress has a lot to recommend it.

Untried Trio To Face

Blue Devils

Saturday

By BORIS WEINSTEIN

When the Duke Blue Devils visit the Stadium Saturday
for the grid opener with the Panthers they’ll befacing an
entirely different defensive backﬁeld than the one they were

up against just one year ago.

Coach Tom Hamilton has reluctantly turned the job over

to a trioof untried gridders.

This year_’s defensive backs are Henry Ford, 176-pound‘

freshman from Schenley, at safety;
with Richie McCabe, 165-pound
freshman, from North Catholic,
and Ray- Ferguson, 185-pound
sophomore from Jersey Shore, at
the halfback posts.
Reynolds on Oﬁense

In contrast, last year Bill Rey-
nolds, Bill Sichko, and Armond
DiFonso played the important de-
fensive positions.

Of this trio, DiFonso, quit the
squad, while Sichko, just released
from the Marine Corps a week
ago, has not been with the team
long enough‘to' break into the
lineup.

Reynolds, although available,
has moved to the -offensive platoon
and probably will not be called
upon for defensive duty. '

Yearlings Show Promise

The rook-ie backs, though,
showed well at training camp, and
the coaching staff hopes they will
ﬁll the card.’ “Time will tell,” says
Coach Hamilton, “as to how well‘

they show.”
Ford and McCabe are both sure
tacklers with excessive speed-

while Ferguson as early as last
spring has been drilled to ﬁll the
defensive halfback slot.

Hamilton also assigned Bill
Ewing, 190-pound senior from
Peabody, and Gabe Gembarosky,
200—pound junior from Donora, to
back up the line on _the ﬁrst de-
fensive unit for Saturday’s tilt.

Ewing advanced from the jayvee
squad and Gembarosky. switched
from center to fulﬁll their new po-

Capp, Schmidt Return

The rest of the defensive line
includes: George Glagola and Joe
Bozek, one-year veteransat the
‘terminals, Elder Kraemer and Bill
Priatko at tackles, and Charley
Yost and John Reger at guards.

Priatko and Reger are sopho-
mores and past members of the
undefeated frosh team. Kraemer,

This year‘ let’s be different, let’s face facts.
With -the installation of the T formation last fall and
' the ‘beginning of a new regime at Pitt the Tri—State—area was
expecting big things from the Panthers. V
In the opener Casanova’s charges bowed to Duke, 28-14.
Local papers blamed the change in climate. District fans
. waited for the second game before voicing an opinion.

s,....a 

By DON MURDOCK

Editor

In the second contest all hell
broke loose and the’ Blue-and-
Gold was overpowered by Ohio
State, 41-7. This defeat was fol-
lowed by si:; further losses in
seven games The fans were dis-
appointed and came to the de-
cision that the coaching staff was

‘ at error.

People Don” Think

Casanova and his board of
strategy had to face the music.
Whether the cry of the wolves
prompted Ca; to leave Pitt for
western surroundings is not
known at this time, but what is
more important. is the fact that
district fans were expecting much
more than Casanova could offer.

,This year the same thing is

in .prospect The plague is cer- '
tain to hit Tom Hamilton and

his‘ assistants unless early op-

timistic attitudes are changed»
' and changed immediately.

The dopesters have ﬁgured that
the Panthers are going to win at
least ﬁve games. They point to
the undefeated frosh football
squad of last year. It’s true that
the Jungle Cubs were undefeat-
ed, but they were pressed by, West
Virginia and Army and register-
ed victories over a weak Ohio
U. and Kiski.

Besides, only 11 members of the
fresh team are listed on the var-
sity roster this fall. Among them
are two backﬁeld threats that are
bound to appeal to Pitt rooters.
Sonhs Gain Starting Roles

I-ou Cimarolli, a. ﬂeet-footed
halfback, and Bobby Epps, a
hard-running fullback, h a V e
been running first team in prac-
tice sessions -held so far this
fall. _

' Epps, a short 190-pounder
into

the starting berth when Joe
Capp was injured two weeks
"ago, and will be hard to dis-
place.

Cimarolli looks anything but a
football player in civilian dress
but in fooball togs he reminds on-
‘lockers of Bimbo Cecconi.

But these boys lack the polish
which only veterans possess.

.: Freshmen Bid For Berths

With only three days until the

opening game Hamilton has show-

ed a liking to the freshmen grid-

iders, in fact he has several of

them running on the first team.

,Many observers at the« Ligonier
training site felt that this year’s

frosh crop was the best ever to
appear as a unit at Pitt.

This may be‘ true, but fresh-
men very seldom become stars on
'varsity outﬁts. ‘

Nevertheless, Hamilton is plan-
ning a’ defensive backﬁeld com-
posed of‘ four untried men for
the Duke tilt.

At safety it will probably -be
frosh Henry Ford. The halfbacks
will be sophomore Ray Ferguson
and another freshman Richie Mc-
Cabe. .The linebacker will be
either Bi1l.Ewing or Gabe Gem-
barowsky, both veterans with
limited experience at vline—back-
ing. _, ~ r
Schedule Too Tough

In the ..ihtra-squad game and

the Rutgers game both Ford
and McCabe looked’ very good,
but it was easy to see that both
needed plenty of work at the
positions which led to Pitt’s
downfall in 1950.
