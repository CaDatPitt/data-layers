China’s UN Admission

Dance presentations may be
in modern, ballet, or ethnic
styles. Groups may attend even
though they do not want to pre-
sent a composition. Advlanced
registration is due by Monday.

Bennington’s Dance Group rep-
resents an educational institu-
tion which in 33 years has play-
ed an historic role -in the devel-
opment of dance. Today it is a
major center of modern dance.
From the beginning Bennington
encouraged creativity in move-
ment. This approach attracted
such noted dancers as Martha
Graham and Doris Humphrey,
who with their pupils spread the
“gospel” of modern dance
throughout the 30's and 40's.

The Dance Group's six week
tour, held biennally since 1915
‘is wholly student managed. Each
tour member is responsible for
one or more aspects of manage-
ment, such as booking, transpor-
tation arrangements, costumes,
etc. The group will perform at
approximately 30 high schools,
colleges, and private theaters
from Virginia to Wisconsin. Be-
sides performing they will in-
clude master classes, lecture
demonstrations, and panel dis-
cussions in their tour.

Interspersed among the talent

A mock meeting of the Unit-
ed Nations (UN) Security Coun-
cil brought. Red Chin-a’s admis-
sion to the UN under question

last Thursday.

Representatives from the
League of Women Voters ex-
p-ressed the opinions of Secre-
tary of State Dean Rusk, a com-
munist Chinese scholar and jour-
nalist, Medical Missionary Dr.
Judd, who is a US Representa-
tive, and Senator Fulbright.

The representative taking the
position of Russk stated that “the
US does not intend attacking
the mainland of China. The US
should continue the enlarge-
ment of unofficial contacts with
Red China, and keep US politics
up to date.”

The Chinese scholar and jour-
nalist representative was antag-
onistic to US policies. “Your
(US) imperialism in Vietnam
has spread to our (China) bor-
ders, yet we have not retaliated.
Who best fits the title of agres-
sor?” He added that “next to
the Soviet Revisionists, the US is
China’s most dangerous enemy.

Dr. Judd’s representtaive be-
lieved that the admission of Red

China to the UN would be illeg-
al. “The UN is an organization,
China wants to communize the
world by violent revolution. Does
it make sense to let them in?”
he questioned. He maintained
that “it is impossible for the US
to carry the lead of maintain-
ing freedom indeﬁnitely. He
stressed the importance of get-
ting like-minded nations to join
the UN.”

Senator Fulbright’s opinion
was the last stated. His repre-

c ut zed

S r ini A
sentative said that “to assume
that Chinese Communism is
bent to our destruction is to as-
sume that China wants to des-
troy all mankind.”

Fulbright was represented as
believing that the US has an ob-
ligation to act towards China
with generosity and understand-
ing. His s«p-eaker thought that
crisis might be resolved if the
US was willing to remove her
South East Asian military pow-

er by carefully planned stages.

ples in the King and Queen con-

Book Generates Controversy

Present Society Depends on Warfare

by MARY K. ZALLAR

Much controversy has been
generated lately over a small
book about war. The Report
from Iron Mountain takes a look
at the effects of war on the so-
ciety we know, it contends that
society we know cannot exist as
such unless we are constantly
engaged in warfare.

According to Dr. Jerry Is-
rael, instructor in -the history
deplantmenvt, this is n-ot a new
idea. As early as 1890, Williaim
James, the Harvard scholar and
philosopher had spoken of the
need to ﬁnd a moral equ.ivalent
to war. He recognized war not
only as a destructive force but
as an extremely creative one.

Dr. Israel pointed to the Civil
War as a period when great
technical advances, both mili-
tary and civilian, were made.
James sought a moral equiva-
lent underlying economic, (po-
litical, and intellectual creativ-
ity. He saw this as a necessary
ingredient of society.

Dr. Isra.el seees the Report
from Iron Mountain as a more

contemporary work, in the sense

PARTY CAKES

that it attempts to offer a criti-
que in more detail than did the
work of James. The report
maintains that war has a speci-
ﬁc function.

Dr. Israel said, “Unlike Mal-
thusian theory, the report says
that war has a sociological and
ecological meaning. It conutrols
society. War is seen as a basic
ingredient in the control and
creation of society.

“Put in a negtive way, can we
slxrvive in peace? Would Ameri-
can society exist if we take
away the menace of war—wh~at
would motivate our restless so-
ciety?” Dr. Isrvael questioned.

If the report is to be taken at
face value, we must look at it as
a statement of actual policy by
some advisers, according to Dr.
Israel. He said he doesn't think
“American policy is shaped
around these attitudes entirely,
but I am sure there are those
in the State Department who
have thought along these lines.”

Dr. Israel stated that some
people feel that the idea of the
book is so overstated that it is

actually a critique by those who

‘Live for Life’ Is Varied

French Film Stars Montand

by PAUL ANDERSON
Live for Life is a French
A film directed by Claude Le-
louch with a little some-
thing for everyone. There’s
action, romance and a skin
shot (through a shower
stall, darkly). In the inimical
French way, the action revolves
around a man, his wife and mis-
-tress. The man is Yves Monhland,
who plays Robert Colomb, a
celebrated television r e p o rt e r
who comes off like Tarzan of
the French winging his way
through the wiorld with mis-
tress (Candice Bergen) in tow
while wifey (Annie Grirardot)
sits back in the tree hut and
trusts.

Montand, who must have done
gra=duat~e work at the School for
Scoundrels, is a master of de-
ceit. I-Iis imaginary phone calls,
phony job assignments and ela-
bonate excuses make this movie
possible.

One particularly clever scene
sho-ws Montand and his mistress
returning from a bu.s:iness-pleas-
ure trip to Africa. Since disem-
barking from a plane with one’s
mistress when one’s wife is
there can result in a regular
horror show, Montand lets Ber-
gen get off ﬁrst then strolls out
to embrace his adoring wife.
“You know darling, I think I'm
-getting used to traveling alone,”

‘ he purrs.

Candice Bergen looks terribly

tanned and, once you get past
her pointy nose, proves an in-
teresting diversion for Montand.
Girardot as the wife; devoted,
understanding and submissive is
believable enough.

Lelouch packs Live for Life
with action at appropriate in-
tervals by introducing newsreel
footage of marching commun-
ists, rioting Africans and ﬁght-
ing soldiers in Vietnam. By mak-
ing Montand a television news-
man, he keeps the ﬁlm exciting
when it could become maukish.

But that's all diversion and
the problem with this ﬁlm is
basic. It’s too typically French.

Each year thousands of movie-
goers scan France’s newest cine-
ma offerings to learn the latest
developments in the art of tak-
ing :a mistress and are disap-
pointed. The Italians do it be-
cause they like to; the English,
because they need the money;
but the French seem to do it .be-
cause they have to.

They had their sexual revolu-
tion long before everyone else
and, now, taking a mistress is
a m-atter of patriotism or no-
blesse oblige, like an American
sitting at home in his under-
shirt Wla!t5C.l1lil”1g a ball game while
drink-i-ng a beer. Why, Montand’s
not even good-looking, nor is
his home life unusually bad. H-e
takes a mistress out of respect
for tradition and because he has
a storehouse of French know-
how to draw upon. He’s Jean-

University Offers Program  
For High School Students

ApplIi'c!a)t'ions are now available
to h-ig.h school students for this
year's Junior ‘Engineers’ and
Scientists’ Summer I n.s tit ute
(JESSI) to be held July 14-27 on
the University campus.

The J ESSI program explores
the ﬁelds of science and engi-
neering and introduces the high
school student to college life.
Students will have the oppor-
-tunity to learn about a wide
range of career ﬁelds including
medicine, forestry, aerospace,
the power industry and all
branches of engineering.

Instructors will include 21
University faculty members. In
addition, ten members of the
University administrative staff
will discuss topics such as col-
lege oriem-tati-on, placement serv-
ices, and scholarships and loans.

JESSI participants will reside
on the University campus, the

boys in the Towers Dormitories
and the girls in McCormick Hall.
In addition to a full social pro-
gram, JESSI delegates will hear
representatives of industries dis-
cuss job opportunities and re-
quirements during evening ses-
sions.

Dr. Paul R. McCormick, asso-
ciate chairman of the Universi-
ty’s Department of Electrical
Engineering and director of the
JESSI program, says that appli-
cations are already being re-
ceived and that students will be
accepted on a ﬁrst-come, ﬁrst-
-serve basis. Enrollment will be
set at 150.

Local industries and service
«groups offer sponsorship to
some students who could not
afford to attend. Applications
may be obtained from high
school counselors or by con-
tacting Dr. McCormick’s office.

little pudgy but still plugging
away because “they are there.”

Granted, the world owes a
debt of gratitude to the French
for thinking of the idea of mis-
tres.s— taking, in 1794, but, by
today’s standards their methods
are (deja vu). After America
passes through the ﬁnal stage
of monogamy, the wife-swap
great advances will be made in
the ﬁeld of mistress taking.

Misunderstood husbands of all
nations can look to our ﬁlms
for creativity and Yankee in-
genuity. American scientists
promise that computerized mis-
tress selection will become prac-
ticable within the next decade.

A few years from now, French
ﬁlms of this genre (Live for
Life -among them) will be
studied as the classics while
the sentimental ﬁogs will be
viewed as high camp, ﬁt subject
for titters and knowing winks.
So, Live for Life should -be seen
with an eye to the future, a time
when romantics will sign and
say, “Oh, look how they did
it then. How quaint.”

Leary Seal of Approval
Given to Walker Record

by JOE ANDERSON

The fact that Peter Walker’s Rainy Day Raga (VSD-
79238) has received the Timothy Leary Seal of Approval
should in no way discourage the prospective buyer from
adding this album to his collection. Walker is a talented
guitarist and it is evident by this recording that he is com-
pletely at home outside the flower pot world of Timothy

Leary.

On Rainy Day Raga, Walker has fused certain ele-
ments of both Indian and American folk music into one

form caled by Robert Shelton——
American folk raga. This taxon-
omy is misleading for Walker’s
style is not that of the true In-
dian raga. The drone pattern
and nonscalar subtitities char-
acteristic of all Indian m-uisc
are there but lacking is the
Tala or rythmic be-at cycle.

Like all true artists, Walker
is not concerned with reproduc-
ing an accepted mode but rather
with creating an entirely new
and different style. He does this,
as the album notes tell us, by
ﬁrst setting up a drone pa-ttern
and when he “feels that a steady
pulse . . . has been est-ablished
to work in a . . . popular Amer-
ican folk song.”

‘EPI’ Opens Program

The Carnegie-Mellon University experimental film

group will present its first bill of underground films on
Wednesday, Feb. 14, at 7, 9 and 11 p.m. in the Skibo Ball-
room at Carnegie-Mellon. Heading the program will be
the award-winning Exploding Plastic Inevitable, by one
of -America’s leading young film-makers, Ron Nameth.
The Exploding Plastic Inevitable or EPI is a film based On the
psychedelic revelations of Andy Warhol, and the avant-garde innova-
tions which he has been accomplishing in all forms of multi-media.
Winner of the grand prize at the Experimental Film Festival in
Ann Arbor, “EPI” is soon slated for commercial release. As such,- it
will be one of the few underground films to reach the general public-

Admission will be 75 cents.

The result is a sound more
ﬂamenco than Eastern. The ef-
fect on the listener is one of
mystiﬁcation. It is not impos-
sible to find the neophyte in a
darkened room with his ear
pressed up against a. speaker
muttering, “Now where did that
melody go?”

An attempt to describe VValk-
er’s songs outside of the tech-
nical sphere is inevitably doom-
ed to failure. Each song relies
on individual interpretation and
the r elf 0 re communrica-hility i s
next to impossible. This is not
a fault of the songs which
should be corrected, but on the
contrary it is a valuable asset.
It is a unifying ch-ara.cteristi.c
of all Walker’s work that the
listener is forced to take an ac-
tive part, through the use of his
imagination, in the ﬁnal mean-
ing of the song.

The basic theme of Rainy Day
Raga lies in the organic realm
of nature —- the universal one.
The subject matter is express-
ed in each song title: “VVhite
Wind," “Sunshine,” “Spring,”
“Rlainy D1ay Raga,” “River,” and
more. Walker through his mu-
sic creates tonal images express-
ing both the emotional and spir-
‘itual life. He weaves an irresis-
tible web of sound quick to
catch the unwary listener.

Five Frosh  
Crowned As
Champions

In the midst of several
losing varsity winter sports,

_one particular freshman
team offered a lot of hope for

«future last weekend. The un-
teated frosh wrestling team
«came back from its trip to
Michigan with the Michigan In-
ovitational Freshman tourna-
tment title in tow.

Eight teams competed in the
tournament, all but Pitt coming
from the Midwest. And, even
more encouraging, ﬁve fresh-
men were crowned indisivdual
champions out of the nine weight
classes. ’

“I was really pleased,” smiled
assistan-t coach Bo-b Fehrs, who
i-s helping Dave Adams rebuild
-the wrestling program here. “I
thought we had some really
good boys, and I counted on
them for a good job. But I nev-
er expected that much from
-them. Five champions out of
n-ine is pretty good.”

Those ﬁve champions included
Jack Hopkins (137),Mark Payne
(145), Ron Lavery (152), Bob
Kuhn (160), and Ralph Cindrich
(heavyweight). _

“We were happy to expose
the kids to this kind of compe-
tition,” commented coach Adams.

Wrestling Future Bright After Wee
Soph Unangst Aims To

BRUCE UNANGST
Undefeated at 123.

“There were about 15 individual
state champions there.”

Hopkins, Lavery, and Cind-
-rich all pinned their opposition
in the ﬁnals, after breezing
-through the preliminaries. Mark
Payne, a member of the Junior
World's Champion squad, had
to do some fancy mat work to
«secure a 4-2 decision on two
-reverals in the ﬁnals. Kuhn had
little trou-ble while pinning his
-ﬁrst two opponents, but nar-
-rowly escaped with a 12-11 de-
cision in the ﬁnals.

Overall ,the fresh totaled 72
points, edging Michigan tSate
with 68. One meet remains for
-them —— against Lehigh. That
should be just one more test of
Pitt’s wrestling future-.

Swim Team Breathes
Easier Against Rockets

Facing an easier schedule over the next three weeks,
the ‘swimmers (2-5) travel to Slippery Rock this after-
noon in hopes of starting the long victory string which
could carry them to a winning season.

“We should be able to handle them up there,” said an
optimistic coach Bill Grant. “They have only one really outstanding

boy.”

The boy Grant speaks of is senior Tom Erdos. “He can swim
just about anything,” said Grant, “But his specialties are the indi-
vidual medley and the 200-yard butterﬂy. He could be a real threat.”

Reflecting on Saturday's loss
to Maryland, Grant found en-
couragement with the efforts of
some of his number two men.
One of these, llike Szulman,
came out for special attention.

“This is Mike's third week on
the team and he is really start-
ing to round into shape," Grant
said. “He has showed me a
great deal of determination and
a real concern for the team. I
expect him to be a real ﬁne
freestyler by the time we meet

- «Gmve City (in two weeks)!’

Breasttstroker Gene Hoffman
also performed admirably ac-
cording to Grant. “Gene swam
a real ﬁne individual medley,
«but then came up sick and this
affected the rest of the perform-
cannces Saturday. By the season's
end I expect him to be one-of
our top back-up freestylers.”

Grant also noted the progress
that diver Chester Zeintek has
been making. “He has been get-
ting better each meet. We went
over the videotape of his sat.
ui-day's dives at practice and
have ironed out some his me-
chanlcal errors. We should see
some more improvement this at-
ternoon,’

Acompanylng the varsity to

~ Slippery Rock will be the 12

man freshman squad. Grant is
anxious to see the outcome of
their ﬁnst competitive meet.

ExtendUnbeatenString

by ROY JACOBS

Bruce Unangst seems to be making a habit of going
undefeated. Currently, the 123 pounder is the only grap-
pler on the varsity wrestling team who has yet to lose. And
it may be a long time before he does (if ever).

This season, Bruce is 4-0-1 in dual meet competition.
Last year, as a freshman, he competed in no dual meets
but won titles in the Freshman Easterns and in the Thad-

deus Stevens Open.

At Reynolds High School in Greensville, Pennsylvania,

Unangst was also unbeaten in
dual meets his junior and senior
years. But he always had his
problems in the State Cham-
pionships. For instance, in his
junior year, he lost in the state
ﬁnals in an overtime match.

The following year he lost the
championship on a riding time
decision, 9-8, to Harry Weinhofer
of Shamokin. Weinhofer again
poses an obstacle to an unde-
feated season. He's the 123
pouder for Penn State this year.
But Unangst indicated he thinks
he can reverse the previous de-
cision.

“Going undefeated will be a
hard job," ventured Bruce, “but
I think I can do it. Everyone the
rest of the way is tough, but
coach Adams is working u-s aw-
fully hard, and I think I can
take them.”

The only blemish on Bruce's
record this season is a 9-9 draw
with '1‘-emp1e’s Wayne Boyd.

“He’s a real good boy,” re-
viewed Unangst. “I was beating
him, but the match was right
after vacation and I guess I
just ran out of gas. He rode me
the whole third period and got
two points for riding time to
tie the match up. But I hope to
get a return match shot «at him
in the Easterns.”

Probably Unangst’s biggest

challenge in the Easterns, which
will be held in the Field House
this year, will come from one
wrestler who he missed his shot
at, Gary Burger of Navy. Bruce
was suffering from torn liga-

...ond...

ments in his knee.

“The only person I'll have
real trouble with is Burger,”
commented Unangst. “He was
third in the Nationals last year
behind Mike Caruso (Lehigh)
and coach (Bob) Fehrs. I feel
it’s be a good match, and I feel
it’s going to be close.”

The Easterns, though, are ﬁve
weeks away, and Unangst can’t
afford to look too far ahead.
Right now (he’s got to think
about Franklin and Marshall
this Saturday. He’s looking for-
ward to win number ﬁve.

“The boy from F&M is also a
sophomore,” analyzed Unangst.
“Last year in the Freshman

kend Results

 

Easterns, he lost to _a~ boy I
beat. Actually, their best men»
are at 137 and 160.” Neverthe-
less, Bruce urged the fans to
turn out.

'llhe team is always going to
be up for a home mee ,” offer-
ed Unganst. “We weren't sup-
posed to beat Cornell, but we
beat them. The team will Work
hard this week because we can
beat this outﬁt. The crowd Sat-
urday will get a good show.”

If Unangst sounds a little
cocky, he can get away with it.
He's a winner. His is the kind
of spirit Dave Adams is bring»
ing back to wrestling. Bruce has
a bright wrestling fu.ture, but
this may be his very ﬁrst un-
defeated year.

The Pitt News Hawks are hungrily looking for student organiza- 
tions who feel they are capable of fielding a basketball team. Note:

But Charlie Hunt Scores T.K.O.

by MIKE BROURMAN
Assistant Sports Editor

Those fans who appreci-
ate good basketball, and
therefore left early during
last night’s game with Kent
State, missed the ony two ex-
.citing events of the evening.

The ﬁrst was a pugilis-tic e-n-
counter between Charlie Hunt
and Kernt’s Bruce Burden with
two minutes to go. Hunt won a
split decision in the unofficial
press box ballot.

The other was a three point
play by Paul Naponick with six
seconds left that narrowed the
ﬁnal score to 83-73, thus caus-
ing one gentlemen behind the
Kent bench, who must have giv.
en 11 points, to stare in disbe-
lief. ‘

Otherwise, the game had about
as much excitement as a. bowl of
Maypo, and some in the an-
nounced crowd of 514, a ﬁgure
that must have included the
band, the light bulbs, and the
stars in the ﬂag, used the op-

"’3"portunity to catch up on lost

sleep.

They were the lucky ones.
Those fans who suffer from in-
somniia were forced to Watch
some of the worst basketball
played this season.

The Panthens missed a total
of 61 shiotss, hitting only 36 per
cent from the ﬁeld in losing
their tenth game of the season.
Kent was only slightly better
from the ﬁeld, but won the game
at the foul line, connecting on
29 of 33 for 88 per cent. The
cagers mad-e only 13 free throws.

Once again, it was a slow
start that got the Panthers in a
hole from which they never re-
covered. “We can’t afford to get
behind,” said coach Bob Tim-
mons, “because we’re not that
good a shooting ballclub that
we can catch up.”

“Since we started so slow, we
had to go out after them a lot
to try and get the ball. Then
we committed a lot of fOl1llS and
they did well at the foul line.”

Kent devastated the Panthers’
press, turning in a lot of easy
buckets against it. “We didn’t
want to have to press them,”

Timmons co m m e nt e d . “They

have good ballhandlers and good
speed, and we co-uldn’t keep up

' Wllth them.”

Kent’s scoring was well dis-
tributed, since reserves played a
major portion of the contest.
Tom Lagodich, who scored al-
most at will against Hunt while
he was in the game, led the

Bill Bullock added 13, before
he was put out of commission
midway through the second half

“ by a slashing block from Napon-

most impressive of the cagers.
Playing limited time, he scored
eight points and grabbed ﬁve re-
bounds, besides adding some
needed muscle to the anemic
Panther lineup.

When asked if Nzalpoonick is his
hatchet man, because of the Bul-

"‘No,’ Paul wouldn't have inten-

Rob McFla.rland and To-ny De-

by PAUL STOLLER

The information for this article
i was obtained at an informal discus-
sion group of some 25 Negro students.

“The white man's heaven is the black

'man’s hell.” This contemporary Negro

saying shocks many whites, but there isn’t
one white who knows what it is like to
live as a Negro. L

And this saying has validity at Pitt,
says Joe McCormick, a junior political
science major from Washington, D.C.

” “Stokeley Carmichael got his head beat

in down in Mississippi. That was hell.
But we're getting our heads beat in emo-
tionally here tat‘Pitt. This is hell.”

White students at the University have
the‘ misconception that this campus is
liberal and has its fair share of Negroes.
There are only about 60 to 100 Negroes
who are enrolled as undergraduates on
campus, according to Fred Hayes, a senior
from Pittsburgh. That means that on the
undergraduate level Negroes comprise
about one-half of one percent of the total

A undergraduate population. Consequently,

the group of some 25 Negroes that this
writer interviewed constitutes about one-
fourth of the Negro undergraduates on
campus.

Many white students might wonder
why Negroes on campus are not involved
in student activities. There are a number

’ of reasons. “A lot of Negroes at Pitt came

from underprivileged areas,” says Harry
Scott, a senior from Pittsburgh. “A lot of
us haven’t had the previous benefit of a
Consequently,
most Negro students here have to struggle
to make good grades. We are more con-

__ cerned with our education than activities."

Carl Wotten, a junior history major

« from Chester, Pennsylvania saw a differ-

ent reason for the lack of Negro partici-
pation in student activities. “We just

. can’t identify with your activities. When‘
we see the Yard Birds at Homecoming we

don’t appreciate it. We have nothing in

common with them.”
“When a Negro gets into an activity on -

this campus he is looked on as being in-
ferior,” adds Wotten.

‘ “There is total lack of identification
between Negroes and whites in this na-
tion and on this campus,” according to
Lo-u Hansborough, a junior biology major
from Washington. D.C. “Most of the white
students here at Pitt have not been ex-
posed to Negroes.”

Harry Scott agrees with Wotten and
Hansborough about the lack of desirabil-
ity for Negroes to join student activities.
“I graduated from Peabody High School
in Pittsburgh, and there the same sort of
racial situation exists. When I was arsen-
ior, a Negro was elected Student Council
President, and they made him -shave off

0 his moustache.”

The group agreed that Negroes on
Campus are apathetic. But it’s not the
usual sort of apathy. It is an apathy root-
ed in the rejection of Negroes—-the re-
jection of white society,

Joe McCormick says that the Negro is
not accepted by the white man. "1 don’t
believe that any Negro is really accepted,
We aren’t accepted in totality by Pitt’s
administration, faculty, or by our white
peers.”

“The Negro athlete is seemingly ac-
Cepted by white society only because he
is an athlete,” adds McCormick.

The fact that Negroes are rejected by
yvhite society is given. credence by the
13;: Negro girls who tried out for cheer-

er positions. “Last year, five Negroes
went out for cheerleader,” according to
fred Hayes. “All the girls were well quajj-
‘ed t‘? Wm the position by virtue of past
experience. But the selection of the new
cheerleaders is made by a collective vote
of all the old cheerleaders. One Negro
girl made it to semi-finals, and someone
told her to make up her own cheer_ so she

made up a cheer with some rhythm, Of

course, the white cheerleaders couldn't

identify with a cheer of rhythm. She nev-

er made it to the finals.” ,

ing in a little. But the gro-up resented the
fact that one Negro may be nominally se~
lected to a select (white) 0l'g8niZ?Iti0n
just because it is the proper thing to do.
They, in short, rejected tokenism.

Francine McNairy, a senior from Pitts-
burgh, related an incident concerning the
Pan Hellenic Council, the sorority equiva-
lent to the Inter-fraternity Council. “Last
year I received a phone call urging me
to run for Pan Hel Treasurer. I knew the
other girl who was running for that office.
and she was more qualified. I didn’t like
the idea of being urged to run just be‘
cause I was a Negro. That's a good ex-
ample of tokenism.” I

An incident between two fraternities:
Theta Chi, an all-white house, and Alpha
Phi Alpha, a Negro house, is a case in
point. Fred Hayes, a brother in Alpha Phi
Alpha, was approached by a member Of
Theta Chi. The Theta Chi asked Hayes if
his house would consider having a com-
bination party. “The Theta Chi said that
he was pushing this combine real hard in
his house. He told me that he wanted to
have the first Negro-white combine party
on campus. I rejected his offer on the spot
because I knew my fraternity brothers
would resent the idea behind the invita-
tion.”

White rejection and the special sort of
apathy that comes with the Negro’s lack
of acceptability by whites has even affect-
ed Negro participationin such organiza-
tions as the Hill Education Project (HEP)
and the Pitt Chapter of the N.A.A.C.P.

Collette Crosdale, one of HEP’S coor-
dinators, says that “There are some Ne-
groes that work with HEP, but not that
many.” Collette was recently appointed
to her position. However, she co-mplains
that “not many student organizations en-
courage Negro participation. It’s fine if a
Negro is just a member of an organization
but it’s a crime if he takes a leadership
position. They don't want us to run any
of the organizations. I’m the only Negro
that is a HEP staff coordinator.

Not one Negro on campus is a member
of the Pitt Chapter of the N.A.A.C.P.
Former President of Pitt’s N.A.A.C.P.
chapter Roy Morrow explains that “the
image of the N.A.A.C.P. is not at all link-
ed with the beliefs of Negro college stu-
dents. In 1964, it was a fad to join the
N.A.A.C.P. But nothing was accomplished.
I consider my association with the N.A.A.-
C.P. as fruitless."

Fred Hayes agrees with Morrow. “We
aren’t interested in the N,A,A_c,p, 1'

tity.

Hayes summed up his sentiment. “I
have no interest in student organizations.
My outlook is black oriented.”

But why does the Negro on campus
feel rejected? Why has he fallen victim
to the apathy of rejection? The answers to
these questions can be summed up by
what Joe McCormick calls “institutional
prejudice.”

“Institutionalized prejudice,” explains
McCormick, “is not really blatant name
calling; it involves little incidents that
constantly occur. It's this sort of prejudice
that is emotionally demoralizing. One time
I got so angry. I wished I could give com-
pulsory lectures to white students‘ con-
cerning Negroes.” ‘

Most of the students in the group don’t
like the atmosphere on campus. “From the
outside” says Harry Scott, “the school
looks very 1, warm, but it’s very cold on
the inside.”

All the persons interviewed agreed
that the atmosphere at the University is
cold. “We don’t want to go to a school
like Pitt,” says Joe McCormick. “A Negro
who comes to Pitt doesn’t enjoy much of
a social life. When I came to Pitt I wanted
to fraternize because this was supposed
to be a sound liberal institution. My atti-
tudes have changed somewhat. This place
isn’t liberal at all.”

The cold atmosphere and the inade-
quate social life are allresults of the
ever present shadow of discrimination
and prejudice, according to the group.

Norma Booges told of a conﬂict be-
tween herself and Miss Lorraine Sibbit,
of the Dean of Women’s staff. Miss Booges
alledgedly contacted Miss Sibbit in order
to get permission for herself and two of
her sorority sisters to room together. “We
wanted to room together,” said Miss
Booges. “But Miss Sibbit told us that it
was impossible to put three Negroes in
one room. When I told Miss Sibbit that
she was discriminating against us, she
supposedly replied, ‘Oh for heaven
sakes’." After this small protest, Miss
Booges and her friends were allowed to
room together.

This alleged discrimination and preju-
dice, however, is not limited to the Dean
of Women’s staff, according to the stu-
dents. Ron Reid, an engineering student
from New York City, has his complaints.
“People think I'm on the swimming team
just because I’m a life guard at Trees

Pool. Well that's not the case. But every .

time I walk into the pool area I. hear the
same _‘corrirnents.‘ ._ ‘Well, Ron, ‘how is your

dark horse candidate for the swimming
team.’ Once I had a white roommate who
invited me to his home in West Virginia.
He wanted me to see to the slaves his
parents just bought.” ‘

Negroes on campus, moreover, have
no trouble whatsoever in saving seats for
each other. Sylvester Stevenson, a mem-
ber of the Varsity Basketball team, says
that “you never have to worry about sav-
ing a seat fo-r your friends in a lecture
hall. They always try to sit at least three
to four seats away from us. Sometimes I
wonder what’s wrong with me.”

“I have never seen an instance when
we have had any problem saving seats
in the cafeteria. When we sit down at a
table none of the white students will come
near us,” says Joe McCormick.

Francine McNairy adds that “we never
have any trouble finding a place to sit at
football games. If you’ve ever noticed,
all the Negroes sit in one section and no-
body bothers us. Its only at Homecoming
that people try to displace us.”

Another story of dorm discrimination
“When
you sign up to live in the dorms, you

was told by Lou Hansborough.

must put down whether or not you would
mind rooming with a student of another
nationality or race. Well, I have a friend
who was recently contacted by his floor

counselor. The counselor expressed his

concern about the possibility of my friend's
living with a foreign student. In the end,
it was learned that my friend was the
only person on his floor who didn't mind
living with a student- of another race or
nationality.” ’

Harry Scott related his disdain over
an incident with a white student. “One
day I was walking down the street and
this white cat strolls up to me and says,
‘How do brother.’ Well, he’s no brother
of mine. The white man has no conception
of what it is to be black.”

Scotthas a good reason to feel the way
he does. “When I go into McCormick Hall
to pick up my date the resident always
says, ‘I know who to ring up, boy’.”

Although not many Negroes on campus
are involved in student organizations,
many are quite active in their fraternities
and sororities. In fact, almost all the per-
sons in the group were either members
of fraternities or sororities. Why?

Many members of the group insisted
that the Negro fraternity is the epitome
of brotherhood. Joe McCormick, a brother
in Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity, says that
“there is great unity in our fraternity. It
is brotherhood built as a response to re-
jection by the white fraternity system. In
the Negro fraternity there is a real sense
of unity and black identity.”

Aside from the unityand identity, Ne-
gro fraternities, according to most of the
group, have different priorities than the
all-white houses. Harry Scott, a brother in
Alpha Phi Alpha, explains that his fra-
ternity “works with Negroes on the Hill.
We try to help them get jobs so that they
can earn enough money to go to college_’’

“Another one of our projects,” em-
phasized Scott, “is a tutorial program.”

All the Greeks in the group also stat-
ed that they spend less money on their so-
cial budgets. “We may spend up to $200
on our social budget whereas most white
houses might spend up to $2,000 to $4,000
a year on their social budgets.”

All the persons in the group concurred
that Negroes will not pledge an all-white
t1'3teI‘nit.Y- They Seetit as being unrealistic.
They also noted that some of the white
houses discriminate against Negroes.

One member of the group said that he
went to see an administrator about fra-
ternities. “The administrator told me that

 The White World of the Black Student  

  

by DAN BOOKER

(The following article is an ef-
fort to provide a perspective that
will enable the reader to place
Negro student attitudes in the
context in which they are formed
and tested.

The statcmmits in the article
come from a di'sci(.»‘sion of the
Negro student situation by seven
white undergraduate students.
These students were chosen hap-
ha:ard.ly by myself; but I ‘make
no contention that they are a rep-
resentative sample.

Eur’/i student, when asked to

mg the discussion, admitted "I
really don’t think about it much.”
This would indicate that, though.
each of the six had definite atti-
tudes, only marginal concern for
thle black student situation exist-
er .

Participants in the discussion
included: Tracy Black, LA jun-
ior; Sherry Caldwell, LA junior;
Scott Dragan, LA freshman;
Joan Saltzman, LA junior; Steve
Salvatoriello, engineering fresh.-
man; Joanne Telerico, LA jun-
ior; and Joe Valcho, LA sopho-
more.)

“I’ll admit
Negroes have
a right
to be
defensive
with

some people.”

——Telerieo
“With

people.”
-—Valcho

Scottie Dragan is a freshman. A

He hasn’t learned yet that to be
really cool means “Don’t ask
questions." So, he asks them.
Like “Does the colored popula-
tion here really want to asso-
ciate with the whites?”

No one said, “Yes.” No one
said, “No.” No one said, “May-
be.”

Scottie said, “I think the Ne-
gro situation on campus is dif-
ferent than in the society in gen-
eral. The academic atmosphere
makes it different. You can’t
judge a Negro here by the same
things you judge them on out-
side. Hcre, work is most mental
while outside it's more physical.
Negroes seem to be alright as
far as mental work is concern-
ed.”

Joanne Telerico challenged
Scottie. “Don’t you think they
run into some basic problems

with social relationships,” she.

queried.

“Social problems do come into
play on campus,” he replied,
“but not so much as outside.
Kids are more willing to accept
the person-_-they're more un-
biased.”

But, Tracy Black saw a dif-
ferent problem. “This SC11001 is
so much a part of the city that
you can't tell where the school
starts an(l the city ends," Sht?
argued. “The Negro student
doe;n’t know when to put UP his
guard and when to let it down.
’l‘herc are definite walls between
Negroes and whites» built by
b'.)tll sides.”

'l‘hcn 'I‘racy started an answer
to s(-ut.t.i¢-.’s qiicsthn. “One rea-
son I came lierc (to participate
in the discussioii) is lN‘('3"-*9 "f

friend," slic explained. “She

Joan Saltzman also observed
this. “Unlike my high school,
Negroes here are sort of set
apart." But she added that this
is not a problem exclusive to
Negro students. “It seems like
everyone is set apart.”

“Yes,” agreed Tracy, “there
is a plasticene shield around
everyone here and it is hard to
break out.”

“People are just scared to go
out and meet new kinds of peo-
ple." said Joan. “Rut again. this
applies to both Negroes and
whites.”

“That’s right,” said Joe Val-
cho. “Colored kids here aren't
really discriminated against. It's
just that, at Pitt, it's hard to
keep a friend as it. is. I had
acquaintences last year I liter-
ally do not know now. This is
where a lot of Negro resentment
comes up, yet it affects every-
one the same.”

“The Negro is unique, though,
because he is in such a sm.all
group,” argued Joanne Telerico.
“And since these kids always
lived in a Negro neighborhood,
the friends they naturally seek
are Negro. They seek their own
group.”

“Commuters do that,” replied
Joe. He pointed out that Negroes
would have no problem joining
clubs like the Ski Club and thus
meet new people or ﬁnd a new
group. “I don’t think there is
any purposeful ostracizing of
Negroes on the campus. In fact,
the Negro who said to that
girl ‘aren’t we good enough for
you‘ was discriminating against
whites.” \

“Oh,” remarked Sherry Cald-
well, “we’ll always associate
with people we’re comfortable
with, but we’re comfortable be-
cause we have the same interest,
not because we have the same
color skin. Interests are what de-
termine whom we meet.”

Scottie asked another ques-
tion. “If there is going to be a
change in attitude among whites,
it will have to start on campus?”

Sherry said it would deﬁnitely
have to happen in the educated
segment first. But she warned,
“Prejudice is only a reﬂection
of society. Tliei‘e’s nothing spe-
cial about the campus.”

“You’re right,” said Joanne,

“Most prejudice comes from the
family background. The solution
rests in changing the attitudes
of our age group. The question
is are we really as unbiased as
we think.”

“Well, I think one prejudice
after another eventually drops
off," added Sherry Caldwell, “but
prejudice towards some group
will always exist.”

Tracy Black said, “It will al-
ways exist because there is
‘something in people that makes
them need to vent all their mal-
ice. Prejudice is a big wart that
may go away from one place but
still come up in another area.
Maybe in a hundred years there
won’t be a Negro problem, but
there may be a white problem.
People enjoy prejudice.”

“Still, we have to be willing to
give the Negro a chance,” said
Joanne. “The problem is some-
times they don’t give us a
chance. Don’t you think the Ne-
gro is defensive about his posi-
tion?” -

She didn’t wait for an answer;
rather, she told a story about
a lost mcal ticket she confiscated
while checking in the Towers
cafeteria. A Negro girl reported
the ticket lost and was allowed
to enter the cafeteria. Later, an-
other Negro girl came through
with the ticket that had been
reported lost. When she took the

girl called her a “nigger hater.”
Joanne said a meal .ticket is
conﬁscated about once a night,
but this was the first time it
happened with a Negro. .

Then, the girl who reported
the ticket lost came up to her
and said she had found the tick-
et. which was impossible. The
girl left, but later
group of Negroes returned to
harass her. “We take meal tick-

tlie same

ets from white kids all the tziine,
but they don't get a gang of
kids, who stand there and jeer,”
explained Joanne.

Tracy Black agreed that Ne-
groes are often very defensive.
“Guys use the same thing-‘I’m
Negro’--as an excuse or ration-
alization for not getting a date
with a white girl or for not get-
ting a jo .”

“I'll admit Negroes have a
right to be defensive with some
people,” said Joanne.

Valcho remarked, “With most
people.”

“But they should give us a
chance to show we’ll accept
them as persons,” reiterated Jo-
anne.

“The basic problem is they're
in a minority, so they build a
wall to protect themselves,” Scott
Dragan argued.

Steve Salvatoriello noted that
the minority point was very
true. “It's very seldom I see a
Negro student.” Steve's reaction
to a. statement by one Negro
student that. there were only 60
Negro students at Pitt was the
same as that of all the other dis-
CllliSIO-n participants—“Is that
all!”

Joan Saltzman insisted, “There
must be more than that. If
there aren’t, the problem -must
be in admissions.”

“Well,” added Joe Valcho, “cer-
tain high schools get discrim-
inated againstgand that's deserv-
ing.

What the White Students Think On:

DATING

Some Negro students have
charged that interracial dating
is frowned upon by the Univer-
sity administration to the ex-
tent that white girls who date
Negro men are called in for a
conference in the Dean of Wom-
en’s office. This was the reaction
of the White students to this
statement:

BLACK: I've heard that too—on
no real authority, though—that
this happens (girls getting call-
ed to the Dean of Women’s of-
ficer. '

TICLERICO: The Negro is cons-
tantly on the defensive so this
may be making too much of
something. If -it is true, it's ab-
solutcly disgusting.

SALVATORIELLO: It's a basic
fact that we are conservative

kids here saw a Negro guy with

“But if whites understand the

“It would be discrimination to

contended Joe Valcho.

“Yes it would be discrimina-

seven white students, there were
several specific areas where a
special problem seemed to exist
for the Negro student. Some of
these are covered below.)

TELERICO: It doesn’t bother
me either, but it would be shock-
ing to a majority of students. I
saw this at George Washington.
People would say, “Isn’t that dis-

TELERICO: But, again, they
just feel it’s useless to try. And

Editorial: Only a Beginning

When The Pitt News first decided to do a special supplement on
The Negro on Campus, we recognized that we were spotlighting a sub-
ject that had heretofore been virtually unexplored. Because there had
been no violent eruptions or obvious racial tensions on our campus,
no one bothered to look beneath the surface calm. If they had, they

wwccwould have seen that there are serious problems of communication that

have been ignored far too long.

Our various sessions in preparation of this issue gave us the
opportunity to do some soul searching ourselves. We realized that if
white students on this campus have not been guilty of flagrant dis-
crimination, they have been guilty of something far worse——they have

Q been guilty of ignoring Negro problems altogether.

The session conducted with white students discussing the Negro
reveal how valid the criticisms of Negro students are when they claim
they are stereotyped. For although we make no claim that the white
students who participated in that session represent a random sample
of University students, the fact remains that they are students at this
University and they have serious misconceptions of the Negro. If col-
lege students are so inflexible, how can we castigate 'whi’tes who have
not had the advantage of an education when they turn to a George

Negroes who are undergraduates on this campus. Estimates range
from approximately 60 to 100, which isn’t even one per cent of‘ our
total enrollment. For an urban university situated near two Negro
communities with a tuition lowered to $225 a term, it is amazing at
first when one learns how few Negroes attend our University.

After probing further, however, we realized that the situation
is far from pleasant for'the Negro at this University. Even Negro
athletes, who do receive acclaim for their achievements, are unanimous
when they say if they had known that the University had this unfriendly
atmosphere when they first applied, they never would have come here.

We do not pretend that the problem explored here is unique to our

campus. We also recognize that serious attempts to rectify inequities in -

educational training cannot begin on a University level; this must be
resolved in the primary and high schools. However, this is no excuse
for our University. to sit back and allow the situation to stagnate. We
certainly hope that the-efforts now underway by our Chancellor and
his administration will make a desperately needed dent.

Our supplement just introduces a problem that has been ignored
far too long. If people ignore this problem further and disregard our
results, we will have failed in our purpose. But far more important,

   Medical School Reaffirms ‘No Discrimination”

    

by ALICE GOLDSMITH and ANNE DORN

The Un.ivensity’s Medical School remains ﬁrm in
its denial of charges of racial discrimination by the
National Ansocuiation for the Advancement of Colored
People (NAACP).

T .o.r~l Tulu. .LL _ \*r A A

Last July, the NAACP sent a letter to Robert
Naxsh, national director of the US Office of Equal Op-
porrtuzviaty, urging immediate investigate into the Uni-
versity’s policy of accepting Negro students to Medi-
cal School and -of the hiring o-f Negro faculty mem-

ers. The letter was signed by Dr. Charles E. Green-
lee, chairman of the NAACP Medical Committee, and
Byrd R. Brown, president of the -NAACP’S Pittsburgh
branch.

Joseph G. Colangelo, director o-f University News
Publications, representing the University, answered
the charges. He explained that the problem facing the
Medical School is attracting academically qualiﬁed Ne-
gro students among its applicants.

In a recent Pitt News interview, Brown agreed with
this statement, to -an extent. He said, however, that
the educational system ‘is one of “buck-passing.” “Hav-
ing come from a ghetto, a genius wouldn't have an
IA‘!!!

But the problem for th-e Medical School lies in
“obtaining suitable Negro applicants,” according to
Dr. Samuel P. I']J3.I‘blSOn, associate dean of the School
of Medicine and director of admissions. He added that
“the talentr-d ones (qualiﬁed Negro students) have
their choice of any medical school.

The University Medical School has, in the past
ten years, accepted 11 of the 20 known Negro appli-
cants. “'Ihe exact number of Negro applicants is not
known due to Pennsylvania's Fair Education Prac-
tice Act of 1961.”

Dr. Harblson questions “the University’s obliga-
tion in upgrading the entire education of the Negro.”
He also questions whether the Medical School -should
be “properly concerned in pre-medical educational pro-
grams for this group.” He asserted, “It is not the Medi-
cal School’s responsibility to provide qualiﬁed aca-

' demic background. . . . Rather these -programs should
emanate from the high school and undergraduate
level.”

Brown also ‘accused the Medical School of be-ing
arn “insitituti-on set-up with criteria assigned to pro-
mote the interests of another age.” He believes the
present “purpose of the Medical School is to see
whether the ‘community is being served with enough
com.pe-tent doctlons, so the health of the community
is protected. . . . The Medical School is not doing m-uch
to achieve th-is goal. If prov;di-ng enough ‘doctors is
not its goal. it doesn’t need to exist.”

,According to the 1967-68pSchool of Medicine Bulle-

S ""19 P“-“P033 01 the School of tiedicinegtls to p -

  
 

pare students for the scient-iﬁc and humnanistic prac-
tice of medicine.” Dr. Harbison said that it appears
that in r.rder‘ to increase the number of Negro grad-
uates. the Medical School would have to lower its ad-
mission standards. “It is dangerous,” he stated, “to
lower the standards. I do not think the staff would
agree to lowering the standards, especially in such a
dangercus ﬁeld as public health”,

Dr. Harbison said that the -School would also have
to encoura-,-:9 more Negro applicants, although no for-
mal recruiting program exists. The informal policy
includes members of the School visiting local Negro
high schools to lecture and to try to interest students
in the medical professions. Dr. Harbison declared that
the “medical facility is qualiﬁed in the medical area,”

 

“All medical schools are

anxious to enroll Negroes . . .”

§AAAA4AAA4AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

but they -are not equipped to handle an extensive re-
cruitment program.

Brown took issue with the fact that there is no
formal recruitment program for Negroes. “It is diffi-
cult to prove someone discriminates because a person
is a Negro” he said. “A bias in favor (of whites)
doesn't imply a bias against (Negroes). . . . There is
no effort to recruit Negroes . . .”

As for adm-iesasions, according to Brown, “Often
people in making judgments may feel they are ob-
jective, but judgments themselves are subjective.”

In defense of the Medical School, Dr. Harbison
affirmed that “I have never seen -any evidence or dis-
crimination against the Negro during over 15 years
on the Admissions Committee. There has been dis-
crimination for him when identiﬁed. During the 21

V¢r1\¢srn,,

  

of any ‘quota’ which Dr. Greenlee  referred to
several times in print.”

Student enrollment was not the only area under
NAACP attack in the recent conversation with Brown.
He hit the employment of the teaching staff as well.
Brown said that the highest position the Negro re-
ceives is clinical instructor, which “means he has no
syisntematic teaching duties . . . it's nothing.”

By the Medical School deﬁnition, however, a clin-
ical instrucior is a part-time employee of the Univer-
sity, and generally is employed elsewhere in private
practice. Le-afing through the School Bulletin, one
notices that most of the faculty are clinic instructors.

Brown charged that the University School shows
no help for the Negro “thal the public may be aware
of. . . . There are no indications expressed that Ne-
groes are involved.” He stated that the University has
a “poor image.” ;Pitt has never shown—being between
the Hill and Homewood-—interest in the Negro com-
munity that’s visible.” He indicated that if the Amer-
ican Negroes admitted to the school -are counted; the
results average one a year.

Answering these accusations, Dr. Harbison as-
serted that “Ian identiﬁed Negro applicant who shows
potential is always interviewed, usually several times.”

“It is to the beneﬁt o-f the Negro applicant if
he lets the school know he is Negro, since he will get
a careful interview.” According to Dr. Harbison, “all
medical schools are anxious to enroll Negroes, es-
pecially qualiﬁed ones.”

But Brown was not too optimistic. “If a school
has earned an image through years of practices, it
doesn't change overnight. Pitt has to prove over a
period of time that the attitude of those who control
the University will change. . . . I'm not making judg-
ments of the present administration. The University
must decide what role it. intends to play and make a
commitment. It can't do it by preachments. Negroes
have been hearing whites say how much they love us;
it doesn't fool us anymore.”

“I have some reason to hope the administration
will make some progress, but it will be agonizing.
The students don't seem concerned and student con-
cern is an effective device.”

Proz.;1-ess on the charges of last summer hlave ’

been slow, according to Brown and Dr. Greenlee.
Greenlee emphasized that the federal government has

- The Negro Athlete - After He Gives

His Show, His “Friends” Leave

by GEORGE LIES

He stands 6-4, and weighs 200
pounds. He either can carry a foot-
ball 100 yards, be timed under ten
seconds flat, or he can score 40
points in a basketball game.

He is a Negro athlete, and while he is
giving his show, his performance, every-
one knows him. He is their friend.

Afterwards, even when the clock reads
zero, he remains an athlete. When he is
introduced informally to someone, he is
introduced as that super star, or as one
of the fastest guys on the team. He doess’t
mind it. Much. At least it’s better than
having -to introduce himself.

He is not known as an individual. He is
known for what he can do, and what he
can produce. That's it.

He’s treated as a commodity because
sports is all he has; it is the only way he
can make it wherever he goes.

He’s well-known on campus, at least
moreso than the Negro student who isn’t
in athletics. But he is known as an ath-
lete, not as a friend. It’s okay to be with
him, if all your friends know he is an
athlete; and they will, you’ll make sure
of that.

Five Negro athletes gave their views
on the Negro athlete’s status on cam-
pus. The opinions varied somewhat,

“Everything you do is measurable,"
Stevenson said. ‘‘If you run a 9.5 and an-
other guy runs a 9.8, you're better. You’re
known for this. The Negro athlete fills
those stadiums. And he’s treated as a com-
modity.”

Wooten, objecting to the “commodity”
tag, said that once a coach and an athlete"

Wooten said. “A lot of misgivings are

out was that the Negro athlete is isolat-
ed not only from the white majority,
but also from the Negro mino_rity.

“When a Negro participates in a sport.
he’s accepted,” said Steve Stevenson, a
part-time playing guard on the basketball
team. Stevenson, from Tulsa, Okla., has
been the only Negro on the varsity bas-
ketball team since 1963-64.

Carl Wooten, “a good friend of Steve,
out of necessity,” said the only close
friends he had were other athletes. “They
gotta look at you as- a teammate. Their
job depends on it.”

“As for other students, it’s a horse of
a different color,” continued Wooten, a
trackman from Chester, Pa. “Their ex-
cuse for knowing me is that I'm an ath-
lete. But some of them are friends. Some
of them.”

“Negro athletes are treated differently
than the average Negro student," said J.
D. Lewis, a freshman from Raleigh, N.C.
Lewis is a three sport man, football, track
and tennis.

“The reason I was late coming here
for the interview is that someone was in-
troducing me to his girl," Lewis said. “He

frosh tailback from Buffalo, N.Y., also

joined the discussion.

The views slanted to the Negro as
an entertainment product, and the
oyiinions illustrated that a Negro was
also equated with victory.

“Everyone expects you to run a 9-5
on the football field, weaving in and out,
while running with a pulled hamstrinl-’./’
Garnett said.

“And if you don’t do it everytime, they
think you're loafing,” he continued.

“Dave once had a pulled hamstring,
and they asked me to go talk to him,
and see what was wrong said Lewis.
They wanted to know why he wasn't put-
ting out. They thought he was loafing.”

“Yea, in high school, I was a three-
sport man,” Wooten said. “I felt like a
three man circus.”

“They all leave after you put on your
show,” Garnett interjected.

“If you walk into a department store
with a Pitt blazer on, they wait on you

then they always ask what do you do, are
you a halfback?”

Wooten pointed-out how Hubie White,
a Negro basketball player who brought
fame to Villanova, was exploited.

“He never received his degree,” said
Wooten. “They gave him a certificate of
attendance.”

“Do you know what he’s doing now?”
Wooten asked. “He sweeps out the Villa-
nova gym.”

“When everyone learned that there
were five Negroes on the freshman foot-
ball team,” related Stevenson, “the first
thing everyone said we, ‘We gotta keep
them in school’.”

“One other freshman football player
came up to me and said, ‘It’s good to see
colored guys on the team. Now we’ll have
some speed, and we’ll win’,” Watkins said.

"Watkins, told of his father's advice.
“Get in sports. That’s where you have to
make it,’ my father always said.”

“My parents are scared I’m going to
off somebody,” said Wooten. “I get
frustrated at the things around here. My
parents. are afraid that someday I’m going
to blow my top.”

“Why do you think all the top fighters
are Negroes?” Wooten asked. “They’re
hungry. They started fighting as an out-
let, but then they learned it was the only
way to get out of the ghettos.”

Stevenson supported Wooten, and said,
“I’ll have to keep at this. It’s the only
way I can make it.”

Watkins, who was injured during foot-
ball season, didn’t see much game action.

“No one knew me,” Watkins said. “I
didn’t score any touchdowns. I didn’t do
anything. Other students didn't know me.”

Then Lewis blurted. “We’re not al-
lowed to get hurt. When we get hurt,
we're always Ioafimg.”

“A former Negro football player told
me that Pitt is under great pressure to
get Negro athletes to come here,” Wooten
remarked.

“And you know what they did when
they brought this one athlete here to see
the school,” continued Wooten. “They
took him to the Hill District to meet all
the prominent Negro businessmen on Cen-
tre Avenue. They didn’t take him to Squir-
rel Hill or Shadys-ide.”

(The three freshmen football players

had no comment on Wooten’s accusation.)

“Some people ask me why I get an-
gry,” Wooten offered. “Well, I’ll tell you.
I don’t like being called ‘boy’ anymore.
And I want the best. If a white doesn’t
want it, I don’t want it. I'm tired of get-
ting the crumbs.”

“We’re proud,” Wooten said, “Prob-
ably, the proudest.” Wooten is one of the
eleven Negro athletes at Pitt; eleven Ne-
gro athletes at a “cosmopolitan” m1ivers-
ity.

Though Wooten is an individual, he
falls to the stereotyped-Negro. Every Ne-
gro is thought to be an athlete; a com-
petitor who “can only” run and jump like
an animal.

No matter where he goes, the reaction-
is the same; just like Garnett and Wooten
pointed—out.

“Taxicab drivers‘ never stop on the
street for me; they always think I'm going
to the Hill or to Homewood,” Wooten
said.

“But one day, a cabbie did stop,” Gar-
nett said, continuing the story. “Remem-
ber what he said Carl? He asked us if
we went to Pitt and I told him yes.”

“And the next thing he asked was ‘Are
you a football player?’ ”

With a spe-cial supplement the Pitt News focuses
on race relations in the university.

This is a topic that cannot be discussed without em-
barrassment, exchange of criticism, and some recrimina-
tion. Yet it must be discussed. In the midst of the social
turmoil that grips this nation, the most important initial
step is the exposure of personal feelings and misappre-
hensions——even antagonisms—in order that we, the dif-
ferent ethnic groups in our society, may commence un-
derstanding one another and slowly converge upon an
appreciation of our common interest in forging new and
equitable relationships with one another. For the white
majority, and specifically for the white students and
faculty members in this university, the task of approach-
ing mutual understanding requires an extraordinary ef-
fort to acquire some sensation of the special torment,
frustration, and anger that accrue to the black minority.

I lay stress here on the need for mutual under-
standing, but at the same time I recognize the need for

, specific corrective measures to equalize opportunities

within the university.

The first question that comes up is how can the
university bring more Negro citizens to the campus and
how can it make their experiences here more satisfying
and rewarding? In answer, it is the intent of the uni-
yersity to be impartial in both its admissions practices

. p 1 and its treatment of all students. A year after the Civil
 War, a scholarship program for Negro students was
" i started at this university by a local minister. In the inter-
" vening century, the shameful performance was obvious

of ‘most, American universities, including this one, in
failing to attract students from minority ethnic groups.

V»Today, however, this university’s policy of impartiality

‘is firm and is founded upon deepest conviction.

_ Further, we begin now to realize that true impar-
“tiality extends beyond the use of standard testing and
statistical methods that are biased favorably for stu-
dents-—notably middle- and upper-class white students

 ' who have had the advantages of better primary and sec-

ondary schooling. The resulting gaps in performance be-
tween this favored group and others ought to be re-

,_ * dressed by special procedures for selection, for counsel-
‘ 7 ‘ing, and for educational enrichment.

In the months ahead, the university’s staff will try

Statement to the Students of the University 

CHANCELLOR WESLEY POSVAR

opportunities in the Negro ghetto and for providing sup-

port to the students who re-ach the campus from the
ghetto. They shall try, without any clear idea at the out-
set of how to proceed, to work out efficient methods, to
recruit administrative personnel, and to gather the fi-
nancial resources to put the programs into effect. Simul-
taneously, in its internal management, the university
commits itself to equality of employment opportunities.
It is taking positive steps to employ more members of
minority groups throughout its agencies.

Most important in the future, perhaps, is for the
university to strive to serve the city in general and the
nation at large by attacking the problems of urban life
at various levels through its professional and technical
training programs in social work, public health, medical
services, public administration, and urban planning;
and also through its research programs in sociology,
psychology, political science, economics, and philosophy.
These things we shall do.

 

Undoubtedly, all these efforts will go forward too
slowly to satisfy those citizens who have waited so long
for their fair opportunities. And it is a regrettable fact
that the beginning is late. But these efforts shall be as
much sincere as they are necessary, and I hope that the
critics of the university will advise and help us, how-
ever just their criticisms may be.

The basic trouble with specific programs such as I
propose——-and with all the outwardly worthy measures
for improved housing, wider employment, and faster ra-
cial integration that are being implemented across the
whole country—is that many of their ardent proponents
elevate them to the status of ends in themselves. The
programs become ready panaceas, handy cure—alls for
public ills that foster a sense of righteousness in the
minds of those who do want the cleavages in our so-
ciety to be eliminated, but who do not want to try to
“understand.” The black Americans who know the taste
of real bitterness are correct in their scornful appraisal
of those panaceas and cure—alls that are put forth as ges-
tures of prevention or condescension. It is my conviction
that, in advance- of the specific measures, along with
them, and underlying them, must come the dialogue---
the straining of human beings, artificially separated
from one another, to reach one another’s minds.

My comment here is an attempt to contribute to the
dialogue. Some students will be surprised that the phras-
es frequently used in the dialogue are hostile, and that
good intentions by white students are sometimes met
with antagonistic responses. One of the purposes of the
dialogue, then, is to- learn the nature of the antagonism
and to appreciate its causes.

Finally, I would remind you that the dialogue must
be propagated and expanded elsewhere, in other cam-
puses in Pittsburgh, in other universities in other cities,
and in all institutions where white and black groups
can be brought together, throughout the nation. Prior
generations have created the racial problem. They are
passing it now to your generation in the form of crisis.
Inescapably, it is your generation that has the responsi-
bility to solve it. As I perceive the growing signs of your
moral consciousness, I expect you will. Social, political,
psychological, and economic forces that have been brew-
ing for centuries are now converging to give you an his-
toric opportunity.

Serving a city which hous--
es more than 100,000 Ne-
groes, and a nation which

claims over 22 million, a major

urban University is burdened by
the uncomfortable statistic of
having less than 100 Negroes

‘ attending its classes.

The problem is as complex as

V it is disturbing. “But Lord knowts

it's not -a question of apathy,”
says Director of Admissions Ber-
nard Kobosky, as he points to
the folders neatly arrnanged on
his desk. They contain names
from the ghetto high schools of
Westinghouse, tSchenley, and

Fifth Avenue. Kobosky speaks
often of the concern of the Uni-
versity for the future of the
culturally deprived student.
“We have a long way to go,
but we expect great things in
this area,” he forecasts. “How-

ever. it’s not just an admission
problem.”

N 0 one has expressed a great-
er necessity for constructive so-
lutions than Chancellor Wesley
Posvar, The Chancellor has cre-
ated a blue-ribbon study group
to develop a University-wide pro-
gram for culturally deprived stu-
dents.

“Our responsibility as a Uni-
versity,” according to Posvar,
“goes fa.r beyond fostering a ra-
cially integrated social life
among students. We must dig
deeply into the social problems
of our society in terms of re-
search and action”

From the admissions stand-
point, Kobosky sees two ways
to increase the Negro enroll-
ment. First, his office can re-
cruit qualiﬁed Negroes on a na-
tional level, and second, it can

admit Negro students who are,

considered qualiﬁed under spe-
cial programs for the disadvant-
aged.

Kobosky offers little hope that
the first tactic is feasible,‘ at
least right now. “Let's face it,”
he says. “There's a big market
for the bright Negro -student.
Every college in the country
wants them. Harvard, and I'm
sure Yale with their better na-
tional recruiting, can get a kid
just by asking him."

Kobosky explains that it's a
question of ﬁnances. “It’«s ex-
pensive to recruit on a national
level because it means commit-
ing full aid to these kids. It
would be too expensive for them
to come otherwise.”

Acting ,P1'ovost Dr. Charles
Peake feel that tl1¢i¥d‘iua‘l prob

    

s poses a more controversial prob-
I lem. C

 

 

   
   

_lems of admission run parallel,

but should be treated different-
ly. Dr Peake is the chairman
of the Chancellor's study group.

“We're in competition with all
schools for bright Negro stu-
dents,” he points out. “If we
don't have a large percentage,
it means that we haven't suc-
ceeded in competition.” As with
Kobosky, Dr. Peake says, “Sub-
stantial funds are needed in or-
der to compete.”

The University’s commitment
to the disadvantage student,
however, is a ﬁrm one. “The
Chancellor's study group is de-
veloping ways and means to in-
crease the number of underpriv-
iledged students,” says Dr.
Peake. I

The University has embarked
on at least four such undertak-
ings in the past with only mod-
erate success. As Kobosky puts
it, “Are we helping a Negro kid
if we bend to admit him and
then he can’t make the grade
once he’s here?”

Then there is the problem of
d0I'm space. “We wouldn’t be
doing the kid any good," says
Kobosky, “if he spent a. few
hours a day on campus and then
went back to the environment
which bred his problem.” The
Chancellor reinforces that ar-
gumcnt when calls for the ne-
cessity of a “total University
environment, 24 hours a day, in
order for the deprived student
to escape the ghetto”

Faced with a limited number
of living units, Kobosky also

cepti

  
   
       

“who would need dorm rooms,
in favor of 50 promising stu-

dents from culturally deprived

backgrounds?”

Posvar indicates that the dor-
mitory should be solved in “ﬁve
or six years.” But in the mean-
time, Kobosky answers his own
question when he declares, “We
just can’t look at the College
Board-s of these applicants,”
pointing once again to the stack
of folders from the ghetto high
schools. “Of course, their SAT’s
will be low. But are we going
to consider these people a little
differently‘? The answer is yes.”

Dr. Peake notes that one of
the aims of the study group is
to ﬁnd different methods of
evaluating talent. The Universi-
ty is currently cooperating with
the city of Pittsburgh in an ef-
fort to locate and admit Negroes
interested in teaching careers,

Kobosky has just returned
from Washington, D. C., where
he sat in on discussions of Proj-
ect OPEN, which is designed to
interest Washington's Negroes
in colleges and the colleges in
the N‘-‘£,’1“0 high school student.
“VVc want to see what the other
schools are doing," Kobosky (ix-
plains.

A combination of at least three
goals will constitute the Univer_
SIWS pI'0gI‘am to remedy the
problems of the culturally dc-
privcd student Dr. Pcakc cites
a need to strcngthcn back-
grounds, a considerable relaxa-

 Southern Negro Discovers A
‘Subtle’ Discrimination Here

  

by DAN LICHTENSTEIN

“When you’re black and put
in an all white surrounding,
things are not the way you’d
like them to be.” And the Negro
who made this statement is only
one of the Negro undergrad-
uates at the University who ﬁnd
that things here are not at all
the way they'd like them to be.

A frank, informal discussion
was held among three Negro
students and two white report-
ers. The two most outspoken
Negroes revealed sentiments
which are common among all
Negro students here and which
most white students would nev-
er be-gin to realize. Both boys
are here on athletic scholarships,
but there is one signiﬁcant dif-
ference between them, and this
difference makes an interesting
comparison between their re-
spective attitude.s toward their
situation on this campus. One
boy came from a Nzorthern high
school, while the other was rais-
ed in the South.

The two athletes stated that
all Negro students a.t the Uni-
versity, no matte-r what part of
the country they are from, agree
that discrimination here is a
subtle thing. The Negro from
the North said of white stu-
dents, “It’s not that they're out
and out hostile, it’s just little
things that they do. Like they’ll
purposely sit away from me in
class.” He also noticed that a
lone white student may be per-
fectly friendly to him, but when
that student is with a grouap of
his white friends, he will refuse
to recognize the Negro.

Other white students will nev-
er approach or speak to a Ne-
gro out of fear of— what other
whites may think. Some Negroes
are willing to give the beneﬁt
of a doubt, however. Said one
athlete, “It’s not always hate, it
could be just ignorance.” There
is a number of white students
here who had never’ been ex-
posed to Negroes before they
came ‘to the University.

The contrast between the
Northern and Southern Negroes
is not in their observations, but
in their reactions. All Negroes
are subject to the -subtle dis-
crimination at the University,
but the Northerner is much
more bitter about it. .Negroes at
his high school, like those at
the University, were a tiny min-
ority and he faced the same
problems then as he does now.

He is angry. He hates “this
little stuff” of the subtle, North-
ern discrimination. His bitter-
ness is a result of the hypocrisy
of the supposedly liberal North,
and he said he would almost
rather see an undisguised act of
hostility toward him than the
numerous, tiny indications of
prejudice.

There is one partially bene-
ﬁcial result of the Northern Ne-
gro’s situation. Because he does
face discrimination and because
he is usually the only Negm‘ in
his classes, he feels a greater
need to excel] and, therefore,
works twice as hard in his
studies. He feels no obligation
to prove himself to the whites,
but his pride forces him to prove
he is just as good as the whites.

The Southern Negro also feels
he must “make it” here, but for
a different reason. While the
Northerner hals N055“) “lends
in many other universities and
his desire to excell is in I“ea0t10T1
to being in a discriminated min-
ority, the Southerner is one ‘of

- very few students from his all
it-Ncegro ehighasc

 
  
 

attend C014 

obligtaion to do well in any col-
lege under any circumstances.

The Southern Negro’s reac-
tion to the North's subtle dis-
crimination is more of surprise
than of bitterness. The discrim-
ination he has faced all his life
is much more blatant land hos-
tile than that which the North-
ener ha.s faced. The Southerner
has been subject to out and out
name calling, segregated lunch
counters and the like, and he
had expected nothing of the sort
in the North.

But he ﬁnds the subtle hostil-
ity on this campus just as valid
a form of discrimination as the
Outright segregation of the
South. “This kind of garbage is
not expected up North,” he said.
He is as surprised to ﬁnd it as
the Northern Negro is bitter to
experience it.

One point Negroes brought
up about their respective edu-
cations may have something to
do with their reactions to North-
ern forms of discrimination. One
felt that his education at a
Southern, all-Negro high school
was not as good -as mo-st peo-
ple’s here. “It wasn't as com-
plete. The-re wasn't the great
need to think as much.” Corres-
pondingly, the blatant physical
segregation of the South is more
obvious and requires less sensi-
tivity to recognize than the sub-
tles here.

Whatever discrimination prac-
tices Negroes face at the Univer-
sity, they are still no-rmzal un-
dergraduuate-s with the same in-
terests as their white classmates.
They have fraternities and social
lives like all students, but even
in this area they face pressure
as a minority group.

Negroes feel that complete so-
cial ‘integration is almost im-
possible because of the white
male’s attitude'toward a Negro
male coupled with a white fe-
male. “A white woman is more
receptive than a white male,”

-said one Negro. “She can’t get
labeled as a ‘Nigger lover.” But
because of an undeﬁned pos-
sessiveness or fear of corrup-
tion that the white male feels,
very few Negroes would ap-
proach a white female. “Dating
a white girl is completely out.
Not because because she is
white, but because she is a wom-
an.” Few Negroes would risk
-starting trouble with a white
male because of a girl.

Obviously, Negroes mu-st ﬁnd
some social life, so they retreat
from potentially troublesome sit-
uations and mingle among them-
selves. They self-imposed seg-
regation is broken only rarely
by athletic associations. There
are two all-Negro fraternities
and two all-Negro sororities at
the University. For big week-
ends, such as Homecoming, most
Negro males import their dates
from out of Pittsburgh.

In connection with their so-
cial life, the Northern Negro
pointed , out one nnanifestation
of his minority status here. “I
don't know why people always
watch us dance. That's just an-
other instance of how a Negro
is a novelty on this campus.”
When asked if being an athlete
made any difference, he said, “I
feel like a one man circus. It’s
ﬁne when I'm performing; peo-
ple watch and cheer. But not
out of the athletic contest. Then,
I’m just another Negro.” He
added, “I’m not asking for a
wide-arme-d welcome, I just Want
to be accepted as an individual.”

In many situati-ons, he is not
accepted in the University. And
because this is a Northern in-
stitution, it is almost impossi-
ble for him to accept this fact.
It appears that it is far easier
for a Negro to become accus-
tomed to the ﬂagrant physical
segregation of the South as a
fact of life than it is to accept
the subtle hints of prejudice
found in this University.

Pitt Has Unattractive Image

Negroes Criticize School Environment

by ANNE DORN

Because the area high schools
are the main source of Negro
University students, The Pitt
News felt the necessity to in-
vestigate the University’s image
in the Pittsburgh education com-
munity. It has tried to discern
Why more Negro students are
rapplyling and attending the Uni-
versity.

Representing Fifth Avenue
and Westinghouse High Schools,
two Negro senior girls, bo-th ac-
tive in extracurricular activities,
-agreed that the University has
a bad image in the Negro com-
munity. Neither could “put their
ﬁnger on the reason,” but both
felt that the University is un-
attractive to them and their
peers.

At both schools, according to
the girls (who chose to remain
nameless), guidance counselors
are discouraging students from
applying to the University. At
Westinghouse, the counselor
would like his seniors to have
the experience of living away
from home.

If, however, a student applies
to a city school, it is usually
the University, stated the West-
inghouse representative. She
said that in one of the class-

;

rooms, -» there is a bulletin posted ’

in Are .es,.«oI.semors‘.ac-. -aging us

in Ohio, especially Ohio Univer-
sity.

At Fifth Avenue, acknow-
ledged the senior, the counselor
encourages his seniors to apply
to colleges like the Allegheny

Community Oollege, Where they.

have a better chance of being
accepted. He reasons, she added,
that now that the University has
lowered tuition, “Pitt can be se-
lective and pick the very best.”
Neither schools’ counselors wor-
ry about ﬁnances. They tell their
students to apply, then try to
obtain the money through schol-
arships or loans.

S-he personally feels, and says
that s-he speaks for her friends,
that she would be frightened to
attend a University that has had
its name in the news so much.
“All you hear is Pitt did this,
P-itt did that.

“At Fifth Avenue, Pitt is so
publicized that it makes you
feel that if you don’t go to Pitt,
you're nothing. She said that the
students hear so much about
Taylor Alderdice High School
as well, that they feel the Uni-
versity is “an extension of Tay-
lor Alderdice.

One of the problems at Fifth

the couznselors want the stu-

at the University would not be

University.

Both girls have chosen pre-
dominately white colleges. Nei-
ther feels that they will have
much trouble adjusting socially,
since they have both been active
in predomin-ately white organiz-
ations outside their schools.

As for academic adjustment,
the girls feel they may have
some trouble in that area. The
Fifth Avenue stutlent believes
that the Upward Bound program
has helped her. If not for that
she would “be more frightened A
than I am now.” She had just
attended a meeting at which a
speaker said, “The quota of suc-

expected it to be,” and that it’s
“not true what the papers are

“As far as Black politics go, the Uni-
versity is really not much different than
a Black ghetto; opinions among Black
students here run the gamut from total
integration with the white power struc-
ture to total separation,” says a Black
student from the Manchester area -of
Pittsburgh.

The reason that most whites at the
University never hear about Black po-
litics is, he says, “because Blacks are
such a minority and because most whites
aren't interested as long .as their own
positions aren't endangered by other
groups."

A number of Black students concur
with these opinions. They feel that not
only are all Black political feelings found
on campus, but that the attitude o-f the
white students toward these feelings is
very similar to the attitude of the city
as a wh-ole to the rumublin-gs oorning out
of solidly Black areas.

“For example, I live in Homewood
and this summer, when Bouie Haden
was trying to organize -a rent strike and
get the city to do something about the
bad housing in our area, the Mayor just
ignored him,” stated another Black stu-
dent. He further states that the only
other response that the white people
give to those organizing Blacks is to
call such action “Black Power” and then
say “that Black Power means riots; the
government never worries about just
what is really going on—they either ig-
nore it or send in the cops to bust every-
body.”

This problem of deﬁnition may be of
an even greater magnitude than the ig-
norance of the issue. A Black student
from Mlaanchester says, “The papers have
taken Black Power and given it all sorts
of meanings so that the original concept
9§.aB.l~?.‘£1.S§m‘lTlitl£13...t‘l&°_t'1l‘ér .f<2r .p9biti<.ra1

-and economic gains has been lost in the

power structure's fear of topping.”

As the student from Homewood said,
“'I‘»he typical response of the city when-
ever it hea-rs that a “Black Power” ac-
tivist is organizing is -to send in the po-
lice, either to break up meetings of Black
people, or to just cruise around the block
=Wait'ing for trouble to break out. For
example, during the rebellions in New-
-ark this summer, whenever a meeting
was held in Manchester, six or eight po-
lice cars always circled the meeting
place. “It was a miracle that the police
didn't transform a quiet situation into
an explosion,” said a resident of that
community.

But While the press and the govern-
ment have made the words “Black Pow-
er” commonplace, the variety of opinions
contained within that movement have
been for the most part lost in the up-
roar.

A Black student from Manchester
summarizes the “Black Power" senti-
ment-s in his area: “As I said before, the
original concept of Black Power was eco-
nomic and political gains through Black
unity. But now the term applies to al-
most any Black political movement.
‘Many Blacks believe that the only hope
for them is total separation from Whites.
Others believe that Blacks should re-
main independent, but that in this coun-
try there will have to be cooperation
‘with whites. Still other Blacks think that
integration is‘ alright, as long as things
like Black history and Black arts are
taught in the schools. About the only
thing that couldn't ﬁt under the term
“Black Power” is the sentiment expre-ss-
ed by a number of “necktie niggers”
who want to be white——the total inte-
grationists. They’re a lot of these people
around, like Black cops, and the cats
who go to work for IBM and Ford and
that, but as far as Black people are con-
cerned, they’re really not important. The
whites only use them to show when
somebody mentions discrimination.”

This same Black student stated ear-
lier that he felt that the situation at the
University was similar, only less obvi-
ous. Is that assertion true?

In general, yes. Black politics at the
University are like Black polities any-
where else. A random sampling of Black

A Black fraternity member says, “I
think that the Negro can advance best
through education. That way he can
better compete with whites for jobs.”
This student feels that Blacks, being a
minority, should strive to become im-
portant parts of the existing system, or
else will be ﬁorced to stay in a subser-
vant position.

Essentially the same sentiments were
expressed by one of his fraternity broth-
ers: “Negroes are going to be discrim-
inated against no matter what happens,
since the color of their skin automati-

cally makes them different. However, by
getting an education, we can at least
compete with whites on their own
terms.”

However, another ‘Black student, liv-
ing in Pittsburgh’s Hill District, replied,
“If whites are going to call us ‘niggers’
no matter what we do, then why should
we worry about whites? Blacks shouldn't
depend on whites for anything, wheth
it's jobs or an education. We've seen
what the poverty program turned out to
be—-a. fancy name for neo-colonialism-—
and we still can’t get into most of the

Black Politics Here Same as in Ghetto  

decent colleges because of the poor high
schools. I think that Blacks have to start
working within the ghettoes to create
their own jobs, their own stores, their
own banks, and if need be their own
schools. As long as Blacks are living in
this country, they've got to learn to de-
pend on no one but themselves. We’ve
been sold-out by whites too often.”

A Black student from the North Side
said, “As long as the whites keep up
this thing in Vietnam, we aren’t going to
get anything out of them. They’re busy
sending over Black men to kill kids and
=it’s easy not to worry about things like
ghettos. About the only choice left for
us is to organize. If need be, to organize
for revolution." '

Other Black students felt that they
could not oppose the white power struc-
ture, at least as long as opportunities
exist for them wi-thin that structure. Ac-
cording to one such Black, “It doesn't
take much to see that there's a lot wrong
with the system. But I think that it gets
a little bit better each time a Negro
achieves a vital position in a white-run
organization. It’s for this reason, and
because I feel that I personally can gain
from it, that I a.m in ROTC.” Interesting-
ly enough, however, this student is op-
posed to the war in Vietnam.

Some Black students have adopted a
fatalistic attitude. “Sure it’s bad, and I
don’t think that its’ going to get much
better,” said a Black about race relations,
“and no matter how far I get I'll still
be discriminated against. But at least if
I can make money or live in a. nice house
I won’t have to share my food with the
rats.”

But with this diversity of opinions,
few Black students at the University be-
come involved in activities. Their 
rtical views do not relate to the campus
as a whole because their views are ori-
ented about conditions outside the ivory-
tower environment, and because, as a
Black student says, “The whites are just
as happy if we stay in our back booth
in the Tuck Shop.”

The problem of dis-criminati-on is one
which most Blacks think is likely to re-
main at the University and it is a major
reason why Black political opinions can-
not correspond to those of white stu-
dents. Since Blacks are not accepted as
part of the University community, they
remain members solely of the outside
comam-unity. According to one student,
“It’s just natural that we think more
about what's happening outside than
what’s here at Pitt-—th-at’s our life «and
that's where we’ll be for the rest of our
lives. Even the cats in fraternities aren't
worrying about the school too much.
They’re just -getting ready to ﬁt into
white society.”

A Black student, graduating in Aug-
ust, seconds that opinion. “N 0 matter
what they do,” he -says, “almost all of
the Blacks on campus are just doing
things to help themselves. They say they
don’t like what’s going on and then turn
around and join the ROTC because they
think they can get somewhere in it. They
join fraternities restricted to Blacks be-
cause it makes them feel white. They
know they’re Black but they’re scared
to -do anything about it because some-
body will get mad. But they should know
by now that nobody gives a damn. As
far as I’m concerned, they’re all learn-
ing how to sell out.”

“As far as politics go,” said this same
student, “I don’t like that it’s even rela-
vant. The only thing that's going to help
the Black man is 'a revolution. Any po-
litical games we play with the political
machine are nothing but verbal mastur-
bation, because if the government ever
let poor people have any power it would
ﬁnd itself out of office pretty fast. Sure,
they toss out a few bones every so often,
but that's just enough to make a few
Negroes fall ‘into line."

“As I said,” he concludes, “one day
white AmeriCa’s going to wake up and
ﬁnd itself in the middle of a bloody rev-
olution. People are going to be killed,
but how m-any Black babies die each
year because of inadequate housing, san-
itation, and «medical care?-This system’is
r. . and it won’t be long before it's

gel to fall.” a
