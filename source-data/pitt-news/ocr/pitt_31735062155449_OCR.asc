New Seating Arrangement "In
Stadium to Be Reported

 

The extensive projects and prob
lems, which have harassed Studem
Council. since they were placed be-
fore the governing group by the
Pitt Weekly 3. month ago, will con
tinue to be aired at next Wednes-
day’s regular session in Heinz
House.

Several points are yet to be dis
cussed, notably, a. report of an in-
vestigating committee on its con-
ference with the athletic depart-
ment over seating arrangements at
next season’s football games; a re-
port of the ﬁrst tangible work of
the_ University loyalty committee.
appointed this semester, and a dis-
cussion of th. means by whicl
more nationally known speakers
may be brought to’ the University
by the assembl , committee.

Business hel over from the last
session and scheduled for further
consideration next week will include
attempts of Emanuel Fishkin, Bus
Ad. ’30, to secure stu.dent voice ir
the appointment of the Pitt Weekly
editor, action in regard to the es
tablishmeiit of an inﬁrinary for stu
dents, and the report of the fresh-
man traditions committee whichis
now guiding its second lot of first
year students.

Drop Two Needs

Two of the twelve points advo
cated in Park’s letter to council Wil
never receive that body's considera-
tion, both items being’ dropped a?
the last session. These points asked
for an investigation of why twr
men were left behind on the Cali-
fornia football trip after they had
practiced faithfully since Thanks-
giving and an investigation into tlic
unofficial paper which makes its
appearance on the caiiipus fre-
quently, denouncing ' University poli- ~
cies and administrative officials. '

Making a formal investigation. of
this sheetwould be giving ‘its spon-
sors exactly what they desired, “of-
ﬁcial recognition,” was the reason
given by council members in_ voting
to drop the proposed investigation

Still seeking to have-« the Pit:
Weekly “responsible to the studen
body by» having students take part
in the selection of staff heads,"
Emanuel Fishkin will press his «ef-
forts in this direction next ' week.

NEW FRIDAY

 

When school convenes for the
1930-31 term next September a re-
vised schcdule of Friday classes wil‘
probably be in effect. ‘Plans are be-
ing developed by the schedule com-
mittee to eliminate much of the
waste time now occasioned on Fri-

ay because of vacant periods set
aside for assembly programs and
drill practice in the military science
department. '

In their present state,-the-. plans
of the schedule committee provide

. for the elimination of the 50-minute

assembly period each Friday and the
substitution of a half-hour to
known as the activities period. The
drill hour is to be moved up from

riod immediately following from
1:20 to 1:50 o’clock.
Make Labs Possible

Such an arrangement will enablr
Friday morning classes to be oper-
ated on the regular daily schedule
up to 12:30 o’clock when an hour
and twenty minutes will be taken u;
by R. O. T. C. drill and the activi-
ties period. The-ﬁfth period Wil‘
convene at 1:50 and will be short-
ened ten minutes as will all othe:
afternoon classes. The ninth pe-
riod will close at six o’clock.

A change in the Friday schedule
has become necessary, explained
Stanton C. Balfour, secretary for
the schedule committee, in order
that science laboratories may be
scheduled for Friday morning. At
present the shortened Friday morn-
ing periods make it impossible to
hold laboratories on Friday,gresult-

“Individual reward should be
given for individual. merit” said
Thorpe. T “The government should
be cast in the role of umpire,,guar-
anteeing fairplay for each individ-
ual, butit should. not leave the side-
lines to compete with the citizens.‘
By‘ so doing. it destroys the individ-
ualism which is the heart, and soul
of America.” ' ‘ ' 

The speaker added that our pros-
perity is so. great that our individ-
ualism is threatened as it relates to
business ‘developments. That there
is a dangerous tendency to -accept
the Santa Claus idea of government
—a tendency to let the government
-control an industry that could ‘be
better controlled by the community
‘itself. . ‘ .

“ignore candidates for positions on
either of its staffs when it’ becomes
evident that they are not living up

all other major activities have like-
wise pledged their co-operation to

“The freshman cap and tie,” said
Viers W. Adams, Ed. ’30, chairman
of the freshman traditions commit-
tee, “are symbolic of freshman
loyalty to the University and tend
to bring about a, class conscious-
ness, a- strengthening of the bonds
of friendship. The faculty will be
more ready to help freshmen who
observe traditions. In short, they
are a means of integration into the
University.”

and an estimation of the, minimum
amount of space each needs, the
men’: and womenscommittees, with
Van,Fris, Col. ’30, and Sarah Moore,
Ed. ’32, as chairmen, ﬁnd it impos-
sible to conﬁne all the organizations
to the two ﬂoors formerly appro-

other ﬂoor for such activities as the

Clothier gave their sanction to the
suggestion at a joint meeting held
last week. ‘

The “women’s Cathedral commit-

cluding a women's lounge for form-

The new plans, however, will un
doubtedly meet with some difficul

The committees expect to continue
their survey and confer with Jobl-

A Tuesday, February-4 .
The red-letter day of our trip so

far-—-graveyards, - prisons, trains,

sugar cane, debates and women in
a curious mixture, as you shall
presently see. ‘

Awoke (as usual), debarked from
train, etc., and oil’ in a cab to see
New Orleans. ’ Our driver, an Eng-
lishman afflicted with a rush of
bicuspids. to" the mouth, proved 'a
genial soul, and took us ﬂrst to the
old St. Louis cemetery--where the
ﬂrst interment occurred in 1720.
Since water is. struck ﬁve feet un-
derground, the burials“ are all in
vaults, sticking up into the ozone.
Amongst our wanderings, we came
across some old gentleman’s skull,
lying in plain view, whereu on Ten
Yards posed as Hamlet, w th it in
his hands, while the Kernel took a

picture. ‘ -

The-‘city newspa er (The Lafay-

us as “bringin _ a new era of de-
velopment. to t is city” and .con-
tinued with “greetings for the reat
honor this famousand distinguished
team from Pittsburgh has brought
.0 us.’

For the debate we accordingly
put on full pressure. There was

an audience" of at least 400, and an
eager, responsive audience, at ‘that.

FRIDAY, FEBRUARY’ ,14.<1936

  

 A few weeks? ago Pitt student leaders secured the opening.- of the
\ University library‘ on -Sundays for a. trial period. The Pitt‘ Weekly and

‘student council "are convinced the plan is a’ good one arid the action of

library officials indicate they believe~ it is at least worth a fair triall

of February and March. If, at the first of April, Mr. J . Howard Dice, A
librarian, believes the Sunday visitors do not justify keeping "it open it

will be closed for.Pitt students, HENCEFORTH Ann FOREVER.
The chief reason why  trial periodowas secured is because such
an action 'is,un__p:recedented. No one could: say, other than arbitrarily,

or unworth was to give it the trial it is now getting. Let us suppose of-‘have become childlike; all the
'ﬁc.ial.s decide at the first of ‘April the plan is unjustiﬁed. Then sveryoh ‘ ' ’ " ' " " '

but  -experiment of 1930 will be a conclusive proof ‘why the: library
shouldn't spend money to? heat-. the building and “pay attendants- for an

unjustiﬁed demand.

Perhaps Pitt students want the use of their

library on Sunday. after-3

noons, and perhaps they don’t. But they should maileup their minds im-
mediately. Student leaders have done‘ their part by granting the student

body the opportunity to acceptor reject the plan.

The Rebels Yell Again

Yesterday's issue of the Rebel Yell, unofficial and clandestine‘. pub-
lication of ‘a minority group on the campus, provided much amusement

for sane students and, faculty members who enjoy a good laugh. from

time to time. It is interpreted as just another outbreak of hatred on the

part of the “lunatic fringe” of students who curse the
attempt to beat down -all existing institutions. " ‘

‘However, the editors missed their mark if they inten

by, a. [decisive .;53-9 score, swhilevthe
frosh won their third straight meet
by a slight margin, the ﬁnal count
being 32-30. '
~ “Stubby” «Stoﬁan won thes50-yard
free style and placed second in the
100, in addition to being on the win-
ning relay. He ‘was the‘ high point
man for the -Panther» paddlers.
George and Underwood also did good
work in winning their events which
gave Pitt an early lead. Harper,
crack dorsal swimmer. took the back-
stroke in easy fashion, and Sch.mei-
ler out-dove the W-J men to cop the
spring board event. V V * I
In the fresh events Hanna took
the scoring honors Vwith two ﬁrsts
in the 200 and 100 free-style events.
Hanna is a_ ﬂashy swimmer and
about the best 220-man in‘ these
parts. ‘ The freshmen‘ managed to
Jump into the lead in the first event
and held it’ although the -Kiski men
copped the relay and came danger-
ously close to making the yearling
paddlers suifer ‘their first defeat.

Running against Bowen were Roll.

New York U., All-American 880-

luminaries of more or -less note.
The race ‘was fast and excitinr
throughout. Roll assumed the loam’
at the start and held a comfortable
margin until near -the ﬁnish of the
race when Bowen,-_ Edwards and
Mccaiferty started to close in on

back, and the raceédeveloped into a
duel between Roll and Bowen. Rol.l’s

inches.’ g - P "
.Bowen.: also was .}-scheduled to run

February 10. He was ordered, how-

this ‘race. ' . i
Bowen is scheduled to run in_the

RIFLERSF SLUMP;
  DROP guru

That: fateful week in which the
sterling -Panther, quintet sustained
its first setback of the season was
further marked by a decided letdown

an the :'par_t of the" rifle, team; which,

took three on‘ the cliinin that dis-
astrous period.  ,_The University. of
Washington amassed an amaoing
score of 1,398, which was 100 points
better than the_Pitt boys’ efforts.

The University of.-‘Cincinnati was the.

second victor with _a total of 1,381.
while Cornell was the‘ third victor
with arscore of 1_;351.

With a record of nine victories out
of the ﬁrst_e1even starts, the team
appeared‘ set for a. brilliant season:
but innumerable, liandicaps— have hin-
dered the nners from showing:
their best arm. *The team has be-

comes; group of, discoura ‘ed riders, «

hanging on onlybecause t eir stick-_
to-it-tiveness will not permit them
togive up indisgust. ’
‘ ‘Greatly; iiandicapped
Speaking of ‘handicaps one day
during‘ the last: contest the men had
topump water out of the basement
range before the could plant their
feeton good ol', solid ground.
another for thesedays it was so cold

in the range ~th‘a't the men had to»-

wear overcoatsto keep warm.‘ Such
copditi,ons,. no doubt, make the men

feel "m"ore“like‘ aiming at’ the raftj-*

ers of the building than at the tar-
gets. To furtherydiscourage the men,
the-efacilities do not even permit
proper.‘ ﬁring positions. The men
mu‘st'~lio in a prone position -at-' the
edge of a small table. while ﬁring.
All of these handicaps have kept the
team from performing to the best
of -its ability. ’ v .

Nextweek the riders inaugurate
a series of matches. scheduled under
the National‘ Riﬂe Association of
America. The first of these contests
is with Carnegie Tech.

Donchess will continue "to be

CUB TRACKMEN
*   Piouslic  

Prospects for a successful sea-
son for thefreshman track team are
bright. Several former scholastic and
prep school stars have reported to
Coach Shea, who ‘sees great possibili-
ties in them. ‘ ‘

Among the runners are Bill‘ Mil-
ler, former W. P." I. A. L. 220 and
440-yard champion. He has entered
Pitt following afyear at Kiski. Jim
Watkins, A. M. A. half-mile cham-
pion, has also enrolled in the Uni-
versity. He will run in the mile and
half-mile  events for the
trackers. ’ .

Another well—kn'own frosh track-
man is Cornell Cooper, former
Westinghouse -High star. Cooper.
won the National Interscholastic high
jump championship last year with a
leap of *6 ‘feet 3 inches, ﬁve-eightlis
of an inch under the world’s scho-
lastic record.

Armand E. Puig, who has done
over 21 feet in the broad jump, is
another freshman enrolled in the

 

ico City, but he received hisprep
school training..in,.Texas'. . b
" Watkins Will‘ compete in the na-
tional: A. ‘A. U. junior‘ champion-
ships at Detroit on February 22. He
will run in the 1,000-yard race.

Watkins will be accompanied to
the MlC.h1g'8.ll- city by Makigon, an-
other Pitt man. Although he is onl
a fair walker, Makigon is wel
known for his walking ability. He
has won practically every race of
this nature in the tri-state district.
Makigon w_il1_com=pet._e in the three-
mile walk at tliesame meet.

of their biggest scores of the ‘sea-
son. Starting off in whirlwind fash-
ion. Hamas, who was playing po-
site harley Hyatt, scored it roe
field goals early in the gaine, and
with the aid of Mazess who "sunk
several bril1iant- -one-handed tosses,
sent the Lions-into‘ a big lead. .’i‘he
Panthers were forced to take‘ time
out at -this juncure. After talking
things over, they ._~1-esumed play.
Slowly the big lead of. the visitors
was cut down; and when -‘Les Cohen
sunk a foul at the close of the half,
the Panthers went into the -lead,
25-24. V ' 1  . .-
’ Penn State Strong , _
The start of the secondhalf found
play even closer, but after Hamas

four, personal fouls, the Panthers
quickly increased their ‘lead... :'I_‘he
end of the gamefound Pittaleading‘

Hamas, last years’ State‘ star, has
graduated, but Mazess, A Stahley; and
.a few others have returned and these
stars will enable State to ‘present a
formidable front- The Lions are
captained by Stahley, who has been
playing a brilliant game at one of
the guard posts. Sta‘-hley,'in‘cidenta1~
ly, is the sameboy who scored the
touchdown for State at the Thanks-
giving Day football game. He also
played for the All-East team against
the‘All-West team in the New Year’s
Day game. » . v ‘ -

Another well-known State player
is Jack Mazess, the brilliant, for-
ward. Mazess is well known for his
ability to drop“ one-handed tosses
through the hoop. Last year he made
ﬁve such ﬁeld goals aga.-inst—- ‘the
Panthers. He has‘ not been playing
much latelydue to an injury, but he
expects to be in condition to‘ play
against the Panthers. His mates at
the forward posts are Fry, :-Le-yda
-and Davis; all three are ﬁne players.

. The main purpose of this’ set of
lectures, as viewed by Dr. Sage and
other members of the Faculty, is to
offer} those who are interested, but
are-not ‘specialists in various‘ ﬁelds
of study, the chance to hear from au-
thorities in, those particular’ ﬁelds,
and tolearn from them the results
and ‘methods of co-operative study
in _th‘e different ‘departments. Other.
universities have tried this method
of _,;open discussion and have found
them popular. Each lecture will be a
non-technical’, but quite thorough
analysis of results that are at pres-'
ent*desired and obtained.

Faculty members, friends, stu-,
dents and others who are interested,’
are ‘cordially invited to attend. If
this series proves successful, other
open-lectures, such as are given at

V other institutions, will follow.

the answers In-ade to i this question by
fraternity women ..who‘ .were pledged.
aiyear ago, and who were anxiousto
elp the freshmen proﬁt by their
knowledge they had gained ;from the
last rushing season. There are many
questions‘ that come to the ‘mind of
the rushee V that a woman who has
gonethrough the same: experience
can answer.» _  ,

“The rushee should visit the fra-
ternities’ with which she-is _not'so.
well acquainted ﬁrst, even if shehas

can be sure of ‘her choice. Sheought
to bé acquainted with all the ‘groups.
for shernay meet a‘ new group that
she will prefer to all the others she
has known.” was the opinion of at
least one sophomore. ' ,_ A ' 
Another had a slightly different
viewpoint. “Often a freshman‘ feels
that she must accept every invita-
tion to" be polite. She visits parties‘
where she is not interested‘ when she-
should be getting acquainted with
the women in whom she is deﬁnite-
ly interested. If I had my rushingto

go everywhere the way I‘ did. last
year, for I was more confused at the
end of rushing season thiatgllg was at

the beginning.”
