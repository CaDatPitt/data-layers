Commenton Status

By MARSHA REHNS
Chancellor Edward H. Litchﬁeld would make no com-
ment on the lead article in Sunday’s Pittsburgh Press con-
cerning making the University the state university of West-

ern Pennsylvania.

Contacted Monday night, the Chancellor stated that ‘he
was attending a meeting in Harrisburg, today, and a City
Council meeting Friday and as both were official,‘ he Would
make no statement concerning the University’s status until after
the meetings._ I - '

The Press article concerned State Senator Robert Fleming’s pre-
diction that the University will become a State institution. “It’s ri-
diculous to consider any place else,” Fleming said, when speaking
of Indiana State College and Slippery Rock State College.

The Chancellor did state that the idea of the University becom-
ing the state school needed by Western Pennsylvania is not new.

The article cited the “growing resentment among legislators” to
state appropriations to the University which have amognted to $42.5
million in the past teh years.

The Chancellor pointed out that this amount must be compared
with private funds which have been donated to the University and
which amount to about $85 million.

Fluthermore, all Senatorial scholarships for Pennsylvania resi-
dents attending the University are included in the $42.5 million.

A resolution sponsored by Representatives Thomas Foerster, K.
Leroy Irvis, Edward McNally, and Raymond Wilt advised that “many
persons in Pittsburgh and Allegheny Country are being denied a
college education because of the lack of low cost higher education
facilities.” »

In a letter to The Pitt News, Rep. Foerster stated that if it went
state, the University would charge $300 tuition per term and admit
only ten per cent of its students from outside of Pennsylvania.

When the University of Buﬁalo announced it was considering
becoming a state university, ‘many of its private endowments were
cut off. The Chancellor did not feel that any persons who “want to
give privately to make Pitt a great university would be intimated”
by the University’s becoming “more or less affiliated.”

Chairman of the Board of Trustees, Gwilyn A. Price, also made
no statement on the Press article. “The Board is meeting Tuesday,”
Price said, “and Chancellor Litchﬁeld will speak before it.” He added
that there would be no statement until the Chancellor made his views

Alumni Office Official  
Explodes Apathy Myth;  

Describes Activities

By SHARON CARROLL .

Charles lsler, associate director of alumni activities,
has blasted the misconception that there is a lack of inter-
est on the part of alumni toward the University. ,

“Irate alumni,” Isler said, “have been calling the Alum-
ni Office during the past week in regard to the editorial
in last Wednesday’s Pitt N ews-—Th.is, if nothing else, shows
that they are still interested and that they read The Pitt

dents Aid in enewal

News.”

According to Isler, this is not the only type of support

the alumni give. Eleven per cent
of alumni give money, but “there
are a lot of things they do which
cannot be measured in dollars
and cents,” he explained.

One project undertaken by’ be-
tween 500 and 600 Alumni Sec-
ondary School representatives is
contacting prospective students in
various high schools and inform-
ing them about the University.
There are over 250 alumni repre-
sentatives in Allegheny County
alone. Last year these alumni
contacted between 1,500 and 2,-
000 students.

“This has been a great help in
maintaining the caliber of stu-
dents entering the University,”
Isler stated.

“The alumni also do mailing,”
he continued. “They represent
the Chancellor at various func-
tions across the country when he
can’t be everywhere at once. They
do this at their own expense.
They also attend college nights
at local high schools when the

By FREDFRANK

A     The Danish film, A Strang-

er Knocks, now playing at
A the Guild Theater is a sim-

7 ple tale. One evening in 1947

in the Danish countryside,
.a man (Perben Lersoff-Rye)
knocks at the door of a cot-
tage in hopes of finding shel-
ter from a howling rain
storm. He is a stranger to

t h e W o m a n (Brigitte
Federstiel) who opens the
door, but she lets him enter the
house where she lives alone. She
feeds him and he stays the night.

Immediately, the viewer be-
comes aware of the fact that the
stranger is not the office worker
he claims to be, but that he is
probably an escaped _criminal.

2 e The woman, the widow of .a resis-
. tance ﬁghter who was tortured to

death by the Nazis during the
war, is_ at ﬁrst unsuspecting.

The story gracefully shows the
development of the love affair

 between the two strangers as

they work together the morning
after the man's arrival. He pur-
posely fails to make "a bus back
to the city and he returns to the
cottage, ‘telling the widow he
loves her. Although their love
continues to grow, she becomes
suspicious of his actions after a

few days: her gun is missing and
he goes into a wild rage and hits
her when she says she is going
to the village for groceries.

Then one night, at the height
of the sexual intensity of their
relationship she discovers a. scar
on his arm that resembles an
animal bite. The man who tor-
tured her husband to death was
supposed to have had the Same
sort of scar. She becomes sure
the stranger is her husband's
killer.

The rest of the plot follows
what the viewer would expect;

"there is no twist ending.

There are things to criticize
-about A Stranger Knocks. The
music is unbelievably amateurish.
The movie, which is stark by na-
ture, would have been more effec-
tive without it.

Kudos certainly must go to
Miss Federstiel and Lersoff-Rye
for their performances in the
lead roles. They truly live their
roles and completely fulﬁll the
intensity of the love scenes.

The ﬁ1m’s greatness, however,
is not really in the superb act-
ing or the effective photography
of the wilds of Denmark. It is
great because it decided to show
life, not the thin surface of our
existence which most movies
choose to present. The “discov-
ery” scene has tremendous emo-
tional impact because the two

are in the midst of intense sex-
ual relations. The scene could
not have been described through
dialogue nor would a scene of
less intensity have done the job.

You will not walk away from
the theater thinking you have
seen the greatest ﬁlm ever pro-
duced, for the plot is rarely ex-
citing and the outcome is expect-
ed. But it must _be viewed as
progress. in the ﬁlm .art, because
it survived -several censorship
battles and is being shown uncut.
Now people can see movies with
plots that are‘ intensiﬁed and
greatened by the fact that they
were not hindered by censors’
taboos. .

The movie is an important ﬁrst
step. If society would let individ-
uals be their own censors and if
ﬁlm producers would have the
courage to produce more ﬁlms
like this one, the movie industry
could begin to realize a fantastic
potential as an art form. Other-
wise it will remain the mediocre
mimicry of our society that it
often is.

  Questions Unanswered

The smouldering question of whether this University
should become a state institution has broken out into a con-

 A flagration. The flames have been fed by recentstatements

by Pennsylvania State legislators which has created ban-
ner headlines and editorials in Pittsburgh newspapers.

What these people want is a low-cost institution in this
part of the state, namely the University. Unfortunately,
they don’t see all the possible ramifications of such an act.

One of the most fundamental problems is size. Since the
concept of the state university embodies low-cost education
for many, the question arises as to where and how the great
number of students are to be housed, fed, and taught.

Even now housing is at a premium with some of the

x I female undergraduates living in nursing residences. New

dorms are planned, but ground has not yet been broken for
any. In addition, classroom space is also at a -minimum.
The state might give money for such new buildings, but
where would they be built? Oakland is highly developed

and any site the school might have in mind is probably occu-
-pied by a building. '

Professors are also needed. Our faculty is quite good
for our size. It would be a gross injustice to ask them to

increase their teaching burdens. New faculty could be hired,

but a good faculty is not built overnight. If a new inﬂux of
students occurred rapidly, a build-up of quality faculty

f imight not be possible and as a result, the quality of educa-
tion might suffer. _

Another point can be raised about whether, as a state

‘university, the University would have different admission

patterns. The State of Pennsylvania’s admission standards
might not “be as stringent as are the University’s, which
could lower the quality of the students. ‘

For this University to become a state institution raises
some important questions that cannot be answered by in-

, creased state aid. What is necessary is that the State of

Pennsylvania appropriate more money‘ to set up a scholar-
ship fund for more needy students. The idea that the Um-
versity as a state institution would provide the needed low-

. cost education in this area, is at best very shortsighted.
Such a move would create more problems than it would ever

solve.

groups.

ONE GROUP distributed
neighborhood evaluation
sheets in a 27 block area.
Their object was to inter-
view home owners on such
subjects as housing, schools,
traffic control, and a per-
sonal evaluation of their pri-
vate properties. During the
afternoon the volunteers
doubled the community re-
sponse to the 'Council’s ques-
tionnaires.

The second group worked
on improving a private
apartment. This I particular
apartment must be describ-

A Boon to Democracy

The teach-ins are in great
measure an outgrowth of the
increasing activism on the
part of students and faculty

‘ produced by the civil rights

movement. It is no accident

. that the organizer of the
first teach-in at Michigan is

:- also a leader of a CORE
' chapter. The idea of a teach-

in type protest is similarlv

.;-.1. borrowed from the Civil

' Rights movement.

 AT FIRST the Michigan
' professors had planned to re-

fuse to teach—to strike for

. one a  in__ order to protest

 

 
  
  
   

   
  

  

\.'

  
 

“ﬁrm  H 

emor Romney and the pres-
ident of the university, how-
ever, objected to the strike.
Dr. Sahlins from the Michi-
gan anthropology depart-
ment suggested that rather
than “teaching -out,” the
professors should “teach-
in.’’

More interesting than its
origins are the results of the
teach-ins. As a form of po-
litical protest, their impact
has already been great. The
mere fact that McGeorge
Bundy, the primary archi-
tect of our current Vietnam
policy, thinks it necessary to
defend our policy in the na-
tion-wide teach-in this Sat-
urday indicates that the
Johnson administration is
quite concerned with this no-
vel form of political protest.

The teach-ins are not only
a successful form of political
protest, but also a stimulat-
ing educational device. It is
popular to criticize the
teach-ins for being too one-
sided, yet advocates of the
administrative point of view
have been invited to and
have participated in the
teach-ins.

Finally, t ‘h o u g h they

tion’s policy, the teach - in .

should be done. Thus, sig-
nificant debate is encourag-
ed. . '
THAT THE TEACH-INS
have been of great educa-
tional value is demonstrated
by the fact that on the cam-
puses where teach-ins were
held the students (including
those who didn't participate)
are sill avidly discussing the
pros and cons of our Viet-
nam policy.

The success of the teach-
ins is very encouraging in
two respects. First, it her-
alds an increasing participa-
tion of intellectuals in our
political processes.

Second, the success of the
teach-ins indicates that the
enthusiasm generated by the
Civil Rights movement is
transferable. ‘

We are finally beginning
to recover from the stultifi-
cation of meaningful politi-
cal discussion in the country
as a whole and on our cam-
puses in particular that had
resulted from McCarthyism.
Our intellectuals. are once
again questioning the funda-
mental assumptions that un-
derlie our policies.

The concern, the enthusi-
asm, and the committment
which now exists on our
campuses ..is _a .welcome

 

  More Than Protest

By Warren Brennan

ou-r way into the apartment
through a half-open door we
stumbled into a dimly lit
hallway. Eight small girls
came running through the
door directly behind us, ap-
arently oblivious to the odor
of mildew and urine.

We immediately started
piling the living room furni-
ture into the hall in order
to beginopainting. After
clearing the walls of spider
webs, mold, and cockroaches,
we began painting. Mr.
Frank Watanabe, Director

of the University YMCA

made a game of the painting
and enticed the small girls
into participating. Their mo-
ther, caught up in the fervor
of work, also participated.

TWO HOURS LATER the
living room was completed
and we moved into the small
storage room. The green
walls covered with crayon
scribbling fell under our
brush strokes and emerged
the clean and bright. One of
the students attempted to
repair the light fixture in
this room, an obvious need
in a five room apartment
that had only two working
lights.

The two completed rooms
were vast improvements in
comparison to the children's
bedroom. Two beds and a
crib, used to sleep 8 young
girls, were jammed into that
litter-strewn room. Mixed
among the wet, dirty bed
linens were bread crusts,
dirty clothes, shoes and a
pair of scissors. The ﬂoor,
covered by a patchwork of

LITTLE MAN

/

 

linoleum pieces, was encrust-
ed withmonths of dirt and
dust. Cockroaches ran ram-

pant, along the baseboards
and into the mattresses. We
moved one of the beds into
the previously painted stor-
age room, giving much need-
ed space in the small bed-
room. Running shortof time

we could only sweep the

floor and make the beds.

The single day’s work

does not finish the project,
but it establishes a starting
point for future develop-
ment. The group will return
this Saturday in an attempt
to complete the renovation.
The mere renovation of the
apartment is not enough.
The objective is to demon-
strate to the family those
values and motivations that
will make them integral
parts of their community.
Included in this plan will
be tutoring sessions for
the children, homemaking

courses for the mothers, and

the aid of a social worker in
maintaining their continued
progress.

THE “Y” CORP offers each
volunteer the possibilities of

a new magnitude of social

awareness in return for his
time and initiative. Second-

1}’, it provides the student

a direct confrontation with
reality that will prove inval-
uable.

A college cynic might de-
scribe it as altruistic; a real-
ist will recognize it as a chal-
lenge and primarily as a
positive social commitment.

_ The baseball team has not
\ faced many tough pitchers
in compiling its 11-1 record
this season. They may,. how-
ever, "face John Radosevich,
_' one of the natioI_1’s top col-
‘ legiate pitchers, when they
play West Virginia at 3:30 p.m.
. today at Leech Farm Field.
W Radosevich currently leads the
nation in strikeouts, averaging
16.9 per game. In one game this
season, he set a new collegiate
record, striking out 22 batters.
’ ‘His record this season is 6-1 with
a 1.10 earned run average.

The track team faces three
top teams as it enters the
ﬁnal two‘ weeks of duel meet
‘ competition. This weekend,
the squad travels to Ohio
‘University, and next Satur-
day they host Notre Dame and
. Penn State in a triangular meet.

With a 3-3 record, the.track-
sters must defeat at least two of

‘the teams to ﬁnish above the
.500 mark. Penn State has al-
ready outpointed the tracksters,
67-41', in a quadrangular meet at
. ‘Morgantown.
" » Notre Dame, as always, has a
squad loaded with exceptional
‘middle-distance and distance run-
ners. The track team’s approach
will be to defeat a well-balanced
Ohio University squad, and then
ﬁnish no worse than second in
the triangular meet.

1 “If we beat Ohio and one of
the two teams in the triangular,”
said coach Carl Rees, ‘‘we’ll have
had a successful year.”

-It will take some real “iron.
1111311” perform-ances from the
trackmen to defeat two of their
three remaining opponents. From

two count he can rely on any of

Chambers, who has caught for

- the better part of three seasons,

compares this year’s squad to
1963 team, which ﬁnished 18-3.
“The morale is exactly the same
as then,” he said. “Everybody is

squad has been depleted to 15

Several of the tracksters have
decided not to attend summer
school and do not compete in the
outdoors season. Damien Koch
has been lost through academic
diﬁiculties, while Larry Hubner
and Doug Doben were both lost
with leg injuries.

“In ’63, there was much more
talent, but it was concentrated
in too few areas,” he continued.
“This year we’ve got more bal-
ance. We’re not great, but we're

good enough to go .to the NCAA

tournament.”

Chambers has been pr.aised as
‘one of the best defensive catch-
ers in University history. This
season he has missed only one
game.

“In doubleheaders, I don’t get
that tired unless there are a lot
of ground balls on which I .have
to back up ﬁrst base,”' said Cham-
bers. “If there are, I lose any-
where from eight to ten pounds
during the two games.”

Last season Chambers batted
only .108, but has raised that to
.264 this season. “Doug is a much
better hitter in his summer league
than he is with us,” said Coach
Bobby Lewis, “but we try to
keep him confused by hiding the
calendars and keeping a sunlamp
in the training room.”

The mitters travel to Bucknell
Saturday, and play successive
games against St. Vincent, Hiram,
and West Virginia next Monday,

Tuesday, and Wednesday, respec-
tively.

Intramural Softball Leagues are
‘scheduled to begin this week.

streak against Carnegie Tech at the Chartiers Country Club,
Friday. Saturday, the team travels to Ohio for a triangular

match with Toledo and Ohio University.
After losing their first seven matches of the season, the
golfers will attempt to duplicate last year’s 61/2-2:1/3 win over

the Tartans. “The boys talk like
they’re going to take Tech, .-and
then beat Duquesne and Saint
Vincent, next wee ,” said coach
Rex Peery.

“We don’t know how we’ll do
against the Ohio teams because
we have nothing on them,” he
said. For the past two years, the
golf team has beaten neither
team.

After competing in the East-
ern Intercollegiate Golf Tourna-
ment at Yale last weekend, Peery
changed his line-up for this
week’s matches. '

State, the titlist for the past two
years. The golfers ﬁnished 14th
in a ﬁeld of 16 teams, beating out
Cornell and Colgate.

Fassett had the team’s low
four-round total of 162, but it
was seven strokes over the cut-
off at 155. The 16 golfers who
made the cut, played-off for the
ﬁnal individual championship
yesterday. _ ,

“That Yale golf course was
very unusual,” said Peery. “It
had so many traps and water
hazards besides those elevated
greens. It was really something.”

Tennismen    

Play Three
Foes Away

Slippery Rock, Bucknell, and
Carnegie Tech host the tennis
team tomorrow, Friday, and Sat-
urday, respectively. Last year,
the tennismen lost to Tech, 7-2,
and Bucknell, 8-1, but the Rock-
e.ts are newcomers to their sched-
ule.

Sam Donatelli and Larry
O’Loughlin go against Tech’s Sal-
im Kahn and Doug Love in the
local rivalry at theTartan’s home
courts._ Bethany has beaten both
teams, Tech losing, 6-3, while the
tennismen lost, 9-0.

“Off his score of last week",
Phil Fassett will replace (Clair)
Riley in the number one spot,”
he said. “And for the seventh
position, Mike Liebo and Fred
Hoaglin will play-oﬁ."

Although Dick Winters. shot the
lowest 18-hole score, 80, it was
Fassett who led the team. He
managed 81’s on both days. Win-
ters shot an 89 Sunday.

Yale won the tournament by
ﬁve strokes. dethroning Penn

Parks anywhere

You can stand on your head looking fora place
to park on most campuses. And all you end
up with is a headache. But not if you ride a
Honda. It needs only as much_elbow room as you with
an armload of books. So you can squeeze in a little closer

to that 8 o’clock class than—yo_ur -4-wheel competition.

A Honda helps keep you solvent as well as sane. Prices
start about $2l5*.You’ll get up to 200 mpg, depending on
the model. And practically never need service. The
star performer above is the CB-160. Just one of the 15 ‘
Honda models. With its 4-stroke,.twin cylinder engine
and 16.5 HP, this showotf does better than 80 mph. Look
into a Honda soon. No more headaches.
