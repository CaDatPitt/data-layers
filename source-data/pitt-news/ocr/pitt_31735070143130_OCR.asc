Tuition likely to rise on main campus

by Joe Kennedy
Staff Writer

University ofﬁcials said they
won’t increase tuition at Pitt’s region-

al campuses, but a raise for students

at the main campus is “likely”
Pitt spokesperson John Fedele
said administrators are waiting to see

the state budget before they decide
whether to increaseituition at Pitt’s
main campus. State appropriations
account for an average of 10 to 11
percent of the University’s annual
budget.

Fedele said inﬂation could also
trigger a tuition increase.

He said several factors account

his work on page 2.

 

for the discrepancy between the
main campus and its satellites.

“The focus of the main campus
is not just on education, there’s heavy
research involved,” Fedele said.

In 2008, the University received
$641 million in grants from third
parties, including the government,
private foundations and corpora-

tions.

He also mentioned the difference
in “economic pressures” between
the urban and rural locations. Living
in the city is more expensive than

living in johnstown, Greensburg,’

Titusville and Bradford, he said.
Feclele added that the main cam-
pus requires students to pay security,

safety and transportation fees that
its regional campuses do not. The
majority of these fees pay for the
main campus’ contract with the
Port :Auth0rity, which allows Pitt
students to ride for free and to use

~ the University shuttle system that

runs across campus. ,,
Since the 2004-05 school year,

Mayoral candidates face off

tions-hosted a forum for the Demo-
cratic candidates for mayor.

A But one candidate, Carmen Rob-
inson, noted that two_ prominent
nonproﬁts were left out of the dis-
cussion: colleges and hospitals.

“When I think of taxing non-
proﬁts, I certainly don’t think of
the arts or music,” Robinson said.
“I think about  large hospitals
and universities, and I know that’s not

popular. But the only reason that I do
‘think of those two entities is because
they share probably 50 percent of
the property in Pittsburgh, and that’s
not taxable.”

She said citizens must pay more

taxes to compensate.

Ravenstahl noted that nonproﬁt

that amount to 1.25 percent the next

I /1 /71 emorium: Local artist Virgil Cantini

Michael Heater I Senior Staff Photographer

Local artist Virgil Cantini created numerous sculptures around Pitt's
campus, including the "death trap" in Posvar Hall.

pittpoliceblotter

by Brandon Ellis
Staff Writer

Scattered across campus are re-
minders of Virgil Cantini, founder
of Pitt’s studio arts department.
His sculpture “Man,” which sits
on the Fifth Avenue side of Parran
Hall, is a symbol of man’s power.
Its jagged points represent the
heights of man’s progress.

The giant mural in the lobby of
Chevron Hall is also Cantini’s. The
work, “Science and Mankind,” de-
picts a man and a woman touching
hands- and symbolizes the birth of
the scientiﬁc and computer age.

And then there’s the pointy
sculpture in Posvar Hall, which
students affectionately call the
“death trap.”

Cantini, who lived on Craig
Street with his wife, Lucille, died
11 days ago, at the age of 90.

John Cooper, dean of the
School of Arts and Sciences, re-
membered Cantirii’s “passion for
making art and belief in the role
of the creative arts.”

“His legacy is unique in that
the campus will be graced by ﬁne
examplesof his art for many years
to come,” Cooper said._ '

Cantini came to Pittsburgh to
get his undergraduate and gradu-
ate degrees.

He was born in Italy, but im-
migrated with his large family to
the steel town of Weuton, \W.‘_Va.,
where he became a star high school
quarterback.

After brieﬂy attending Manhat-
tan College in New York City, he
accepted a scholarship to attend
Carnegie Tech, which is now Car-
negie Mellon University.

During his sophomore year, he
volunteered to enter World War
II, during which he made topo-
graphical maps and models in
North Africa.

He returned to obtain a mas-

St. Sebastian tied to a tree stuck
with arrows. This sculpture, along
with one of the Virgin Mary, can
be seen on the first ﬂoor of the
Hillrnan Library.

In addition to art on Pitt’s cam-
pus, Cantini was commissioned
to construct many sculptures for
the city, including his work “Joy
of Life,” which sits atop a foun-
tain near the East Liberty Pres-

byterian Church

and a doctorate
from Duquesne
University.
While pursu-
ing his degree at
Pitt, Cantini told

sity should teach

asked him to teach the class and the

a Cantini taught for and oversaw the
department of studio arts for 38 ,

years.

Cantini, who preferred making
sculptures and porcelain enamels
because of the medium’s perma-
nence, had a studio and gallery
inside his home.

He used his backyard as a ﬁre
pit when he welded.

Raised as a Catholic, Cantini A

also liked making religious art piec-
es, including a wood sculpture of

Moot Memo-
rial Courtroom,
a porcelain enamel structure called
“Enlightenment and Joy,” which
hangs from the first ﬂoor of Pos-
var Hall, and an enamel-on-steel
mural called “Aerial Scape,” inside
the lobby of One Oliver Plaza
Downtown. 9

Cantini’s daughter Lisa, who
lives in Shadyside, said he always
expected the best out of himself
and others. “He always thought
you could do better than what you
did,” she said. ,

He is survived by his daughter,
Lisa, hissister, Emma DiCiccio,
and his brother, Andy.

Students struggle to

find jobs for summer  

by Lori Stover I
Stzzﬁ’ Write/‘

_Pitt student Andrea Bennett, who is taking

summer classes, spends about 30 hours per
week working at a Subway in -Mt. \‘€"ash—
ington.

Still, that’s not enough, she said.

“I work 30 hours, but that’s absolutely.

nothing when you get paid minimum wage,’-’
she said. A

A student at Pittjohnstown, Bennett said
she comes home to Pittsburgh in the summer

I to take classes and to work,ibut ‘she has a
hard time ﬁnding someone to hire her just A

for the summer.

She surveyed a couple of options and .

applied for a summer counseling job but
had no luck. I i ‘ .

‘As for her hours at Subway, Bennett said
they haven’t decreased much since last sum-
mer, but over the past couple of years, she
has seen a drop. , ' I

In the current economic climate, many

students like Bennett are struggling toiﬁnd .

summer ' jobs, let alone jobs substantial
enough to pay for food and rent. But a few
local businesses say the economy h_asn’t af_,—
fected‘ their employment needs. .
American Apparel manager Cliff Chien

said sales always drop at the beginning of , ‘
— summer, when many students leave Oakland,

but this summer has shown a slightly larger

V A drop than previous "summers.

Even so, the drop hasn’t affected the store
enough to: stop them from hiring when two

. student employees left for the summer-, he

said. ‘

' A Chien said the store provides each em-

ployee with sufﬁcient hours by keeping the
number of employees consistent and low.
So, while the ‘store doesn’t employ many,

said.

it properly supports those it does hire, he .

Chien said he’s hoping sales will pick up

later in‘ the summer, and he shouldn’t have"

to_ cut back hours. .

Lans Oscar, who manages the Rite Aid
on Forbes, said his store hasn’t had to cut
back on hiring at all. *

Like Chien, Oscar said business slows
down after the spring semester ends, but

he said the decrease in business has been .
' comparable to last summer’s.

The store hires mostly Pitt students, so

other people looking for jobs haven’t dis—'i

placed students there, he said.

Some students have found success ap— '

plying for jobs through the work—study
program. ' '

Pitt student Yewande Olugbade said she _

used the work—study program to ﬁnd her job
conducting research at Children’s Hospital
— but not without difﬁculty.

‘Olugbade said she applied to about 10
different spaces and never heard back from
most of them. I

Olugbade works at Children’s Hospital
about 23 hours per week. She’ll be busy
working there and taking classes this sum-
mer, she said. But after the summer session,

» she said she will need to take another job if
, she can’t get more hours.

Olugbade-said she expects a difﬁcult job
search ahead of her, so she plans on looking
around. wherever she can, starting with the
work—study office again. i ‘

Pitt junior Eileen Tong said she easily
found her job at the International Society

for Bipolar Disorders through the work—-

study ofﬁce.
Tong said she appliedlto several differ-
‘ent placesiand received offers from a few
before choosing the society, where she does
administrative work. '
In fact, Tong said she only encountered
trouble with her job search when she was

Candidates debate donations, salary increases, 911 system

Debate, page 1

Ravenstahl replied that his ad-
ministration contributes a greater
percentage of funds for the food

_ banks than those of the mayors be-

fore him. He also
noted his personal
contribution to
hunger organiza-
tions.

“[City Council
members] ‘took
their raise. I, in-
stead, donated my
raise —— my 2.5
percent raise ——
personally out of '
my pocket for the
Greater Pittsburgh
Community Food
Bank,” he said.

Dowd had the
advantage of speaking last so he
could respond to Ravenstahl’s com-
ment that City Council took their
raises. He joked that he took the City
Council’s salary increase because he .
has five kids and didn’t want to “put
more pressure on the food bank.”

Like Ravenstahl, Robinson also
expressed her support of Pitts-

“If we do not have food pantties,
our crime rate would go up. That’s
the truth,” she said. _

Robinson,
an attorney who

Tuition stays
the same at

Pitt satellites

Tuition, page 1

tuition at the main campus has increased by
$1,976 for Pennsylvania residents and $2,116
for out—of—state students. In-state tuition for
the Johnstown, Greensburg and Bradford
campuses increased from $9,330 to $10,590
between 2004 and 2008. Out—of—state tuition
rose from $19,200 to $20,170. Titusville’s in-
state tuition saw an increase from $8,218 to
$17,098, and its out—of—state tuition went from
$9,328 to $17,962.

Penn State University, which has 19 satellite
campuses, also adjusts tuition rates differently
for its regional and main campuses. Average
tuition for in—state students at Penn State’s
regional campuses was $11,008 per year in 2008
and $16,798 for out—of—state students. In—state
tuition at University Park was $13,014 last year,
while out—of—state tuition was $24,248.

Geoff Rushton, a Penn State spokesperson,
said tuition increases for regional campuses
are generally lower.

He said the school’s main campus, at which
40,000 students attend, has “a wide range of
facilities and costs that require signiﬁcantly
larger ﬁnances.”

Penn State is also considering a tuition
increase and is attempting to keep it at its
smallest. Rushton said the university would
have to increase tuition because of the declin-
ing economy and decreasing support from
the state.

According to news releases from Temple
and Lincoln universities, both schools plan to
raise tuition for the 2009-10 academic year,
but seek to limit any major increases. Lincoln
projects a 3.5 percent increase, while Temple
plans to raise tuition by 2.9 percent, the low-
est in 13 years.

State Rep. Dan Frankel, D—Squirrel I-lill,
said he’d like to see the government give more
aid to state-related schools.

“We’re not doing our job at the state level,”
he said. “We’ve been paying a ﬂat amount in
dollars over the years, but with inﬂation, there’s
been a signiﬁcant drop.”

Chancellor Mark Nordenberg said in a news
release that Pitt is “redoubling our efforts”
to limit tuition increases at its main campus.
For example, the University put a freeze on
salary increases.

Several Pitt students, like Tracy Sharon,
said they’d have trouble dealing with a tuition
increase.

“I rely mainly on ﬁnancial aid, so my par-
ents will probably have to dish out more money
that they don’t have,” she said.

As any college student knows,

 learning can be a tedious process.
 From  notes late at night
 to writing lengthy papers and calculat-
  figures for lab reports, education

} comes at ‘a cost.

Amid the mental strain of college,

 students often forget the bigger pic-
 ture. There’s no doubt all that studying
 should pay off someday, but what
 else will students leave with after four
 years? If students gained knowledge
 only in their chosen curriculum after
3 four years —-- no matter how exhaus-
E tive their comprehension ——- theyd
 leave shortchanged of supplemental
 learning that isn’t found on any class
 syllabus. Essentially, if students don’t
 make a proper effort, they/ll graduate

E without taking advantage of valuable

 extracurricular activities that college
 has to offer.

In an effort to get students more

 involved, Pitt launched the Outside of

 the Classroom Curriculum, or OCC,
 program last fall. Through a host of

;' extracurricular offerings, the program
 aims to broaden students’ learning and
 development beyond the standard
 textbook fair.

The OCC program focuses on

 strengthening several facets of stu-
 dent development, including leader-
 ship development, career preparation,

E service to others and appreciation for
5 the arts. From attending job fairs and

3. seminars to participating in the Pitt

 Arts program, students receive OCC

3 credit

But here’s a different sort of of-

; fenng: Pitt students can obtain occ
 credit by using Pitt’s pharmacy.

On the one hand, the OCC pro-
 gram promotes a healthy lifestyle In
 its most basic form, credit for using
 the pharmacy adheres to this: A sick

student visits the pharmacy, picks up 
his medication and swipes his ID card 
for a morsel of OCC credit 

Of course, University adminis— 
trators had more in mind than this 
simpliﬁed outlook when they de- 
cided to offer credit for pharmacy 
use earlier this year. Offering occ §
credit for using Pitt’s pharmacy seeks 
to get new students acquainted with l
Pitt’s resources, Pitt’s Student Affairs 
spokesman Shawn Ahearn, said. 

Students might have more reason .3
to use Pitt’s pharmacy because of the 
credit incentive, as opposed to Rite 
Aid or their provider back home, but 
Aheam said the action isn’t-intended 
to appropriate business from other 
pharmacies. '

Regardless of intentions, this still
seems like an arbitrary way to offer

, _ credit Under a program that typically 

encourages student exploration of 
programs directly related to curricu— 
lat pursuits, going to the pharmacy 
seems unrelated to the program’s typi— 
cal paradigm. '

If the OCC program will of-
fer credit for use of the pharmacy,
the question looms: What will the
program offer credit for next? \Vill
students be egged to get their meals ‘
exclusively from University 
facilities by way of OCC incentive?
Perhaps students will be encouraged
to live on campus under motivation
from OCC credit

The OCC program facilitates
involvement through organized and
accessible means, and its true aim
shouldn’t be overlooked: It wants to
maximize students’ educational diver-
sity and prospects. The real goals of
this program shouldn’t be misrepre-
sented. OCC credit must be pertinent
before it’s so easily given.

by Noah Levinson
Staff lVI'iter

I’m not a Trekkie.

I can’t list every “Star Trek” epi-
sode title chronologically. I don’t
know how to speak the Klingon
language. I can’t even make my
ﬁngers split apart for a friendly
“Live long and prosper.”

But for the local premiere of
“Star Trek,” 1 donned a red sweater,
stapled some gold ribbon around
the sleeves and taped a Starfleet
emblem to my chest.

I was no longer Pitt student
Noah Levinson, but Montgom-

ery Scott, the chief engineer of

the USS Enterprise.

While most theatergoers found
the costume entertaining, some
Trekkies said they believed my
costumed friends and I had made
fools of ourselves.

“They aren’t real fans, they’re
just a bunch of idiots,” I overheard
them say. They do make a point -
I’m not a die—hard Klingon-fluent
“Star Trek” follower.

But then why would I dress up
for a movie about which I am not
a feverish cult follower?

Two years ago, a director named
Michael Bay decided to revamp an
old cartoon series called “Trans-
formers” into an explosive Megan
Fox—laced ﬁlm unsurprisingly titled
“Transformers.”

I have little respect for Michael
Bay and the commercialism and
near—constant explosions present
throughout “Transformers,” but
it was the summer movie season.
I found a stockpile of cardboard
boxes in the garage and, most im-
portantly, I was bored.

So in the span of a single after-
noon, three of my buddies and I
set out to create Optimus Prime
and Megatron from old refrigera-

tor boxes, reels of duct tape and
spray paint. Before nighttime, we
had noxious paint fumes in our
lungs and “Transformers” cos-
tumes made of our blood; sweat
and household items.

A note to anyone dressing up
for this year’s “Transformers” se-
quel: Have someone else drive you
to the movie theater or put on the
boxes in the parking lot.

Not only is it a dangerous drive
while you’re clad in boxes, but also
why would a Transformer be driv-
ing a car? It’sijust redundant.

Dressing up is an additional
part of the movie indulgence ex-
perience. Movies are meant to be
interactive, but not interactive like
the DVDS that have games like
“Dress the Grinch” and “Name
that Shirtless Matthew McCon-
aughey Scene.”

As an audience member, you go
to the movies to become absorbed
in the plot ——- or even a physical

part of it — and the feeling lasts
even after you exit the theater.
I came from a “James Bond”

movie  the mood to kick ass. I-~

wanted to acquire a tux and drive
my car exceptionally fast while lis-
tening to big band Paul Oakenfold
remixes.

Fast-forward a year later to
Christopher Nolan’s comic cru-
sader juggernaut, “The Dark
Knight.” My excitement for the
film reached almost dizzying lev-
els —— a horrifyingly creepy Joker
and no “whams,” “pows” or Adam
Wests.

Even better: Beyond Two-Face
and the Joker, there are so many
freaking cool “Batman” charac-
ters! H

After a grueling day of Salva-
tion Army and Wal-Mart runs, my
11 compatriots and I marched into
the theater in full cornic-book
garb. .

The entrance is of the utmost

importance — establishing your
character “cred” eliminates any
cause for self-doubt.

Dressing -up means playing the
part. When some little kids started
screaming at our Scarecrow, he just
sprayed milk through little squirt

. guns he hid up his sleeve.

People cheered as the Riddler
entered + green tuxedo and all
—— but it only got better when he
tore it all off to reveal tight green,
question-mark-covered spandex.

Not only had we all become
part of the movie, but we moved
other people to get more involved
 the film, too. Watching our
Penguin stumble up the stairs -in
ﬂippers heartily increased the au-
dience’s anticipation to see the
movie. ‘

But enough reminiscing — I
have to gather my leather jacket,
sunglasses and thick Austrian ac-
cent together for “Terminator
Salvation.”

Fur, psychedelic sound appealing to the rest of U)‘

by Alison Smyth
Staﬁ’ Writer

’ Nothing accompanies psychedelic elec-

A tro—groove quite like fur,

According to Pittsburgh-based group
Black Moth Super Rainbow’s Web site, its
latest release, Eating U5, comes as a “deluxe
hand—numbered CD version that comes in
a hairy sleeve.” V . V

_Black Moth Super Rainbow’s descrip-
tion of the deluxe release of its new album‘

provides an accurate characterization of the V

band itself. » "

For a spacey, dark whimsical band like _
these Pittsburgh locals, hairy sleeves are

the way ‘to go. And it isn’t the first time the
group has used eccentric packaging.

\X/himsical packaging accompanied 2OQ8’s
Drz]>pm—— EP in the form of a scratch—and-
sniff cover. Why hairy sleeves vs. smelly
covers? The band members said, “Scratch
’n’ sniff is too 2008 for us.”

Just as the package oozes its psychedelic‘

style, song titles speak to the almost incom-
prehensible meanings behind the spacey
music. i J

' Lyrics get lost in the overtreated vocals,
but they are so often random and bizarre,
they seem almost pnimportant. The song
name makes the composition more interest-

ing, but‘ lengthy poems aren’t necessary to

ﬂesh out the emotional current. _
A narrative thread exists, but it’s more
in feeling than the reverberating words that
passes them off as lyrics. _ ._
A story emerges through the lens of the
robotic and out—t_here sounds, and snippets
of succinct thoughts help the listener under-

stand just enough to be in the right mindset, V

but.not to overpower the listener’s response
to the musiciitself. A i
, A complex vocal arrangement over the
chimes and disc jockey beats of “Twin of
Myself” would sound gaudy. With under-
stated vocals, attention falls where it should.
Instead of a microscope to words and vocals,
a perfect blend appears. x ‘H ,
Vocals spread in between clean, ground-
ing keyboard solos and warbling noises that
sound like they come from a mandrake from
the ‘fHa'rry Potter” universe. To mask that
weirdly beautiful blend with robotic sounds
would distort the essence of the music-

.“Fields Are’ Breathing” keepsthe vocals"

to a minimum but still has that same fuzzy
style. Even theimore traditional sounds
transform into some sci—f1 robotjam. The
band makes a choice —‘a strange onethat
ﬂows smoothly into the uncharted. Listeners
hear a discordant blend of spacey echoes
and_the rhythmic tap of percussion buried
under some android’s distant groove.
W/hen BMSR does throw in a line or
two, thestory doesn’t become much clearer.

“The Sticky” treads the line between edgy
and weird in a Beck—like, deceptively experi-
mental style. T -

“Youiand me / We’re going to melt away
like apples in the ground” holds a poetic,
mysterious weight, but it has no clear mean-
ing. ’

The spacey, robotic vocals and band-of-

few-words act to serve the band’s purpose”

well. BMSR is far from generic, and it isn’t

Panthers still battling

by Jay Huerbin
Sparta Editor

Despite losing two of three
games in Connecticut over the
weekend, the Pitt baseball team
still has a chance to make theBig
East tournament. '

And that’s good news as the
team heads into its final series of
the regular season. '

“\X/efre not feeling too "much

pressure,” pitcher Corey Baker said. A

“We’re in a good spot because we

vv|"l

control our own destiny.”

The Panthers (26-18, 11-12 Big
East) currently sit in eighth place in
the Big East. The top eight teams
advance to the postseason confer-
ence tournament.

Heading into their previous se-
ries, the Panthers were a half-game
ahead of the Huskies (29-22, 12-12
Big East). But inconsistent pitching
and an insufficient amount of of-
fense sent the Panthers falling into
eighth place. Pitt is now a half-‘game
ahead of ninth-place Cincinnati.

Baseball, page 12

In the ﬂrst game against Con-
necticut, the Panthers bounced
back from their City Game loss to
Duquesne with a 7-4 victory over
the Huskies.

Leftﬁelder John Schultz, who
went 3 for 4 with an RBI, and sec-

‘ ond baseman'Chris Sedon led the

Panthers offensively. Pitcher Nate
Reed also helped. He improved his
record to 3-5 behind six and two-
third innings of ‘work, giving up
four runs on eight hits.

But the second game of the
series belonged to the Huskies,
as they scattered 14 runs on _16
hits over eight innings. Baker, the

’ team’s leader in wins, lasted three

and one-third innings, as his record
fell to 6-3.

Despite Sedon’s team—leading
17th home run of the season in
the game, the Panthers lost to the
Huskies 14-6. 7

The pitching struggled again in
the ﬁnal game against Connecticut,
and the Huskies grabbed a 5-0 lead
after the third inning.

David Kaye pitched six innings,
but recorded the loss and saw his
record fall to 3-3 this season. Short-
stop Chris Tonte led the offense for
the Panthers with three hits and
three RBIs, but the team’s come-
back fell short.

Still, the Panthers are in con-
trol of clinching their first Big East
tournament birth since 2007.

But it’s not only Malkin’s turnaround
that helped Pittsburgh The defense also
improved its play, startingwith I/etang’s
goal, to win Game 3.

Up until game time, itwas unknown
whetherlemngwill even play. After a
hard check into the boards by Wash-
ington’s Mike Green, Letang missed
the rest of Game 2 with an undisclosed

third game of the series Luckily- for the
Penguins, he played. A

Likewise, Capitals coach Bruce Bou-

the refs are favoring Pittsburgh because
