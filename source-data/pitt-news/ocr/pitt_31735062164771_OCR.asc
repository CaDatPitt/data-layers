Using moving examples gained through person-

topic spanned Peace Corps volunteers in the war-
torn Dominican Republic to high school drop-outs
working in the Job Corps.
He told» of a Peace Corps volunteer, in Santo
Domingo who stood in the midst of a crowd which
“‘ was shouting “Yankee go home.” The volunteer
said, “But I'm an American.” The crowd answered
him, “We don’t mean you. You live with us. When
we are hungry, you are hungry. When we walk
through the mud you Walk through the mud.”
People had warned Shriver that‘ there would
i be uncontrollable race riots in Job Corps camps
where Southern Whites and Negroes had been

invasion-“by Congress of the executive.”

Shriver saidehe would do. what President John-
son wants, but he added that the President had
not indicated to him that he wanted Shriver to
continue holding both positions. Shriver closed the
subject by saying, “I will keep both jobs if the
President so desires.” _ ' — . t »

Lashing back at attacks that the local War on
administrators were overpaid, Shriver
said, “The balloon burst about the salaries almost
as soon as it was launched.” The poor live under
the worst conditions, he said, and there is no rea-
son why they should have poor administrators.

Shriver expressed his pleasure at the response
from college students to Volunteers in Service to
America (VISTA), the domestic peace corps. Al-
though -he felt that VISTA could never have
enough applications, he said that the 19,800 ap-
plications they had received (6,000 more than the
initial response to foreign Peace Corps) were
more than he had hoped for.

chairman of the Board of Trustees. The request will be
placed before the state legislature.

The University will also undergo a study by the Ford

The Board of Trustees approved the aid request in resolution
passed at its June 2 meeting. This resolution also made clear “that“
the Board is willing to consider a change in Pitt’s relationship to
the state,” Price said. __ '_

The resolution stated that the chairman of the Board is authorb ,

Crystal Lab Director Given
New Interdepartm ent Status

. Dr. George A. Jeffrey, professor of chemistry, physics,
and earth and planetary sciences, has been named Univers-
ity professor. The crystallography laboratory Dr. Jeffrey
directs has been "given interdepartmental status.

In announcing Dr. J effrey’s attainment, Dr. Charles H.
Peake, vice-chancellor for the Academic ‘Disciplines, said
that Dr. Jeffrey may now “assume the privileges and responsibilities
of membership in my appropriate faculty of the University.” 4

The crystallography laboratory, in which the special pattern of
atoms is studied, was previously attached to the Departments of
Chemistry and Physics and administered through the Sarah Mellon
Scaife Radiation Laboratory. “Beeause its work impinges on almost

they cared little who was next
to them.

Answering attacks that the
War on Poverty would be a pro-
gram, that would beneﬁt only
Negro Americans, Shriver shock-
ed the audience into silence when
he said that 80 per cent of the
Americans living in abject pov-
erty are white. To Shriver, ab-
ject poverty meant less than 69
cents a day per person to pro-
vide for all three meals.

Shriver had also been told that
no one would cooperate on a
racially integrated program in
the South. Mrs. ‘Orville Fabus’s
integrated reception at the Ar-
kansas Govemor’s mansion for
Arkansas workers in the War on
Poverty was proof that the warn-
ings ' didn’t hold true.

The fact for the ﬁrst time a
federal official (Shriver himself)
was asked to speak before a
joint session of the Arkansas leg-
islature was another example of
progress that he cited.

To complete his'speec-h, Shriv-
er quoted Pablo Casals’ address
to a group of Peace Corps vol-

unteers in Puerto Rico. Casals
felt the Peace Corps volunteers
before him represented a return
to man, after too many years of

dedication to the machine, “man _

— who is the object of all of our
efforts.”

his guide dog.

The dog must be from one to two years 0f

At the end of the dog’s training period. the animal

Editorial: Payment Due

 The University’s request for a $5 million appropriation from the state is going
 _ to be very unpopular with many people in the legislature who are already opposed to
2-aiprivate institution receiving state money. But if these legislators would only con-
if , sider the situation more carefully, they would see that the university has every right
.1 V to ask for money from the state. , .
. it It is often said, in reference to undergraduate education, that tuition covers only
f . one half the cost of educating the student. All factors considered, however, the Uni-
I versity does not lose money on the undergraduates. Alumni contributions and state aid,
‘especially in the form of senatorial scholarships, add sufficient funds to the tuition to
cover costs The increasing‘ success of the regional campuses, whose programs are al-
_  most entirely on the undergraduate level, is ample proof that an undergraduate pro-
 gram can be self-supporting. '
 The real source of financial trouble is the graduate and professional programs.
 When professors in the school of medicine receive $20,000 salaries while the entering
 f _ class numbers only 100, financial loss is unavoidable. When a full professor salaried
at $14,000 teaches a graduate seminar of to eight students, financial loss is unavoida-
ble. The size of the classes and salaries makes it impossible for a graduate or pro-
fessional school to be self-supporting.

The greatest beneficiary of the University’s graduate and professional pro-
grams is .the state, or more specifically, Western Pennsylvania. In the Pittsburgh re-
gion, 52 per cent of all physicians, 65 per cent of al pharmacists, and 95 per cent of
‘all dentists are graduates of the University. In addition, 80 to 90 per cent of all
school administrators in Allegheny County hold at least one graduate degree from the
Univeristy. One-half‘ of the County’s lawyers and one-third of its professionally-trained
social workers are also products of the University. . ‘

The University’s contribution to the state, especially from the schools and fa-
culties which incur the greatest loss, more than justifies its appropriation request.

It makes the request a em for payment due. |     l A

ByAlex D’Ippolito

In any discussion‘ of the military draft the really per-

I tinent question to ask is “Is the draft really necessary?”

That one can serve his country well in the Peace Corps,
VISTA, social work, teaching, medicine, etc. there is no

I doubt. However, since the nation’s military re uirements
(1

must be met before any of these other fields, the draft
~ ‘ seems to be a necessary evil.

Traditionally Americans have had a

strong dislike for standing armies, so after

Blamed on Talent Waste

Editor, The Pitt News:

Having just spent three years '

enlisted in the Army, I have fol-
lowed with interest the debate
in the News about military serv-
ice. I can conﬁdently assert that
the services not only fail to use,
but willfully ignore any training

or talents a college draftee or_

ROTC officer may have. As the

Non-Faculty Personnel
Asked for Donations

By NANCY BUTLER —

This year, for the first
time, letters have been .sent
to all non-faculty personnel
of all ranks, asking them to
donate to the University’s

. Armual Giving Fund.

Letters also went out to busi-
nesses, friends of the University,
trustees, and others. This prac-
tice is similar to_that of Prince-
ton, Yale, ‘Harvard, and other
schools. eth ro
schools. For the last 18 ‘years,

I funds ‘were solicited only from

alumni.
Last year the Annual Giving

Fund netted $372,000. Edgar Cale‘
assistant chancellor of Develop-'
ment, stated May ‘Z8 that this’

year the has collected $328,-
’000 from the Alumni at the end

_ of_two__months'  _$1l4,00_0 from
' other donors.  '

He pointed out thatlithe reason

thefﬁgure for "last year's alumni,

giving is larger than _this year's
is because some ofithe alunmi

gave this year as trustees or as‘

part of some other group._Heal—

so added that therevare.-no_ strings "

attached to these donations. Peo-.
ple are free to, donate or not as
they wish.

_The opinions of the University
employees on being asked to do-

. nate to the fund were varied, but

_most sentiments were against the

. practice.

One secretary who has worked
for the University for three‘ years
said, “If they hadn’t raised the

tuition, and if they had given the

promised raises to ful1.time em-
ployees, I would have considered

I. giving. 1 ‘think it is completely
_ unfair.”

» A librarian commented th a t

 

his services as a faculty and staff

‘member were his donation to the

University.

A secretary noted, “You give
your time and labor; that’s
enough. _If I made morehmoney, I
might give.” ' '

“I_ don't think it was right to
go out to the small employees and

- solicitfrom them,” another said.

“I feel we did our part by not
grumbling when our general
raises were frozen two years ago.
Employees took the freeze calmly
and we could have taken the ‘re-
quest for donations better if we
had been given the raises.”

Some workers in the Cathedral
had similar views. One man as-
serted, ' “I think ‘it's a farce. If
they are that much in the hole.

‘ they should quit andlet the state

take" over.” A

‘Another I explained, ‘_‘It would
be all right if we made salaries’

like some of the’ alumni. As em.

One of the workers was in fa-
vor of the donations “I gave,” he
said; “Give them a chance. If you
want your job, you should help
your employer in difficult times.’.’

Another librarian brought up a
new_ point against donating. “If
the money we donate would help
put the University back on its
feet it would be fine,” she pointed
out, “but we have no proof that

- that is what it will be used for.”

‘ployeesi, most o.f'.us make only
_ enough, to support ourselves.”

but my legs were too sore,” continued Koch. “That
was what made my decision to transfer ﬁnal.” .

But Koch had more devotion to the sport than
an average athlete. He spoke to Carver, telling
him of the poor atmosphere Rees created. ‘‘I
couldn’t get any satisfaction and he made it seem
like it was all in my head.

“I realized I was ﬁghting myself, and I de-
cided to correct my original mistake of coming
here by transféring schools.”

Koch's transfer and criticism, however, did
not alter Ree's’s coaching technique. More blunders
ensued, with team morale dipping to a new low.

“Banner was supposed to coach the runners for
the outdoor meets,” said Koch. “He would ‘train
them all week for one event, and Rees would
come up the day before the meet and assign men
to events at random. He never told Banner ahead
of time. Often a man would be training for a
short-distance» run all week, and end up running
a different race at the meet. Banner never knew
what to train them for.”

Rees and Banner often disagreed openly. “The
boys respect Banner more. He’s a better coach
and has more knowledge of runners and their
problems,” said Koch. '

Another poor psychological, if not tactical, mis-
play by Rees occured prior to the outdoor IC4A
meet. “Dick Crout had been the\workhorse of the
team,” said Koch. He was the number two point
scorer throughout the season. Rees did not take
him to the meet.

Last week, Bill DelVecchio had to pay his own
way to the Central Collegiate Meet in Milwaukee.
“What kind of move is that for a school sponsor-
ing a varsity sport?” said Koch. Carver’s only ex-
cuse was that . we don’t have enough money.

“Rees is a nice guy,” said Koch. But being a
nice guy is _no excuse for coaching failures. The
track office is lined with trophies, and plaques,
but only one trophy was won since 1955 when

Rees began coaching.

four-year scholarship.

The change in environment this
year had little effect on Beckett,
who battled .289 in his first col-

Layfayette two weeks ‘ago, he

Beckett. “It was by far‘ the'big-

even though Coach Lewis kept
saying to_ play it like any other

“I was pretty disappointed
that we didn’t win,” continued
Beckett. “But we just didn’t play
our type of game. A ﬁelding club

by giving away three runs. How-

some time, offering him a schol-

Co-captains Fred Mazurek and
Barry Wetzel provided the point-

Beckett. “I always try to pull
the ball. Now I’ve learned to just
go with the pitch.”

years, that--has been the
Athletic Department’s theme
song. But now after years of
practicing on city courts, of
off scheduleslljammed with
away matches, and after
years of losing, coach Ben Pop.e’s
tennismen will have their own
courts.’ ” 

“By the .jfal1 of 1966, the courts
should be completed,” said Pope.

_“The Athletic Department speci-_

ﬁed the fall because of the
weather conditions. In the Spring,
the ground may be unsettled
from the rain, causing the courts
to crack.” ,

“With up-to-date lighting as-
sured, there is going to be a lot
of tennis up there,” he said.

Although the site of the courts
is nearing readiness, the courts’
groundwork has not yet been
decided.

“In all probability, it won’t be
grass,” said Walt Cummins, as-
sistant athletic director. “To be
of greatest beneﬁt to the stu-
dents, a fast draining court is
best. And if there is no holdup,
they will be ready by the 1967
season.” ‘ .

In recent years, the tennis
teams have been poor. The main
reason is no courts, Pope con-
tends. Because there were no

‘courts today.” For * _ l

The addition of the six courts;

a tennis terrace, at least to Pope;
because his teams have .used

The University Theatre will present its
summer production of Moliere’s comedy, The
s _Miser, in Stephen Foster Memorial, June 17,
 P18, 25, and '26 at 8:30 p.m.

. In an effort to better acquaint the students
of the University with the play, faculty mem-
,bers will write articles concerning the work of
Moliere and the play, The Miser, in particular.

"Koch, associate professor of romance languages.

_ At first glance, the last 15 years of
‘-Moliere’s life (1658-1673) should have
ffbeen gratifying for Moliere. It was then
. that this director of a nomadic troupe,
{wandering the southern provinces of
f:‘France since 1646, brought his actors
1; ‘permanently "back to Paris and triumph. Suc-

cess manifested itself very concretely, too:

if ‘ Yet, there is another side to the coin. Ulti-
L mately responsible for the continued prosperity
jof-"his actors, Moliere had to renew their reper-
’ tory constantly. When no playwright Ptesented
‘suitable material, he was expected to furnish
the new piece, even if he was uninspired or
preoccupied at the moment. And preoccupa-
tions were not rare..EMoliere’s forthrightness
and perceptiveness for social foibles created

many powerful enemies, and, as a result, his
plays were often severely criticized.

In.the case of Tartuife, he had to struggle
ﬁve years for the privilege of performing it.

His private life, itself, was beset with cares.‘

From 1656 on, Moliere’s health continued to
fail because of the lung ailment that would
cause his death in 1673, and no one can say
how deeply he was affected by the unﬂagging
coquetry and probable misconduct of his young
wife, the actress Armande Bejart.

It is in this context, then, that we must
consider Moliere’s The Miser, ﬁrst produced
September 9, 1668. There are signs of a hasty
final reduction. Although plagiarisn_1 was not
viewed in the same light as today, Moliere’s
borrowings from such sources as Plautus’ Aulu-
laria) are unusually extensive. It is even more
revealing that this struggle for Tartuffe was
still in progress, the haste becomes understand-
able.

It is also noteworthy that his personal dif-
ﬁculties are not absent from the play. There
are evident physical similarities between Har-
pagon and'Moliere, who played the role, down
to the miser’s cought mentioned in Act II,
scene 5. Wtihout pushing literary biography to
absurd extremes, may we not also assume some
correlation between Harpagon’s vain courtship
of Mariane and Moliere’s conjugal situation?
