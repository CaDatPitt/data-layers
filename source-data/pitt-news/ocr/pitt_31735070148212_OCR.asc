A presidential commission re-
leased a report Tuesday that heav-
ily criticized the research a former
Pitt faculty member conducted on.

V prisoners in Guatemala.

For two years starting in 1946,
John Cutler studied the effects of
sexually transmitted diseases on
some 700 prisoners unknowingly
exposed to syphilis and gonorrhea
as part of his work with the U.S.
Public Health Service. Since last
year, the Presidential Commission
for the Study of Bioethical Issues
previewed more than 125,000 orig-
-inal documents before releasing
its report. 77

“It is important that we ac-
curately document this clearly
unethical historical injustice; We
do this to honor the victims,” said
Amy Gutmann, the chairwoman
of the commission. “In addition,
We must look to and learn from
the past so that we can assure the
public that scientiﬁc and medical
research today is conducted in an
ethical manner  It is imperative
that we" get this right.” / 4

The commission worked with
the Guatemalan government,
which undertook its own research,
and visited Guatemala to investi-
gate further.

The investigation revealed that

It’s a quiet summer day, and the

Fast-forward to August 22,

students swarm Forbes Avenue,

Man robbed,

Tegan Hanlon
Assistant News Editor

The third in a string of robberies near cam-
pus left a man with a shallow stab wound
Sunday night.

Police said ﬁve black men in their early
twenties confronted a 22-year-old man
around 10:30 p.m. on the 400 block of

_ Semple Street — only two blocks from

last Wednesday’s robbery.

The suspects spoke with the victim
for about ﬁve minutes, stabbed him with
what police belive to be a box cutter and
stole $500, a gold chain and the victim’s
bottom grill.

When police arrived, the suspects had
left the scene, but the victim, who was
taken to UPMC Presbyterian, was con-
scious and alert. Police couldn’t confirm
whether the victim was a Pitt student. .

This is the third robbery to occur since
students started moving back to campus.
a week ago. Three students were held at
gunpoint during two robberies late last
Wednesday night and early Thursday
morning. No one was injured during those

.. incidents. -

U.S. works with Guatemala to investiga

Cutler 4 1 _

research in Guatemala was comparable to
research done in Terre Haute, Ind. in 1943,
where prison inmates were exposed to gon-
orrhea. The key difference —- reasearchers
fully briefed prisoners in Indiana.
“The ﬁnding goes a long way to help-
‘ing the Commission answer the question
about whether ethics rules of the time were
violated,” Amy Gutmann, the chair of the
commission said in a press release.
The commission discussed the ﬁndings
at their quarterly meeting in Washington,

D.C. Commission spokeswoman, Hillary
Wicai Viers, said in an email that they plan
to release a ﬁnal report in early Septem-
ber. A

According to the commission’s release,
the Guatemalaniinvestigation came after
President Obama asked oﬁicials to review
the study when documents about the re-
search surfaced last fall.

Allison Schlesinger, ‘spokeswoman at
Pitt’s Graduate Schoolof Public .Health, said

. that the research was uncovered in 2010

Augustlgi, 20:11! The Pitt News I wWW.pittneWs.com

after another professor doing research at
the University found Cutler’s papers.

She said Pitt immediately turned the
documents over to the federal government
and cooperated with investigation into Cut-

‘ ler’s study.

Cutler came to Pitt in 1967, nearly '20
years after his research with the U.S. Public
Health Service. ’

Schlesinger said she doesn’t know
whether or not Pitt knew about Cutler’s
research when they hired him. She did ‘say

that Pitt has now enacted safeguards against
the kinds of research Cutler conducted.
“That can’t happen again, it won’t hap-
pen again,” Shlesinger said. “Sixty-three
years ago, adequate human safeguards
didn’t exist.” _
As previouslyreported by the Pitt News,

   

L j ournalistjean Heller discovered in 1972 that

similar experiments had been conductedin
‘Tuskegee, Ala.’ on syphilis-infected African
Americans between 1943 and 1972. Cutler
was involved in the experiments;

7  ‘ The commission,which Obama created

in 2009, said in the release that it will now
“turn its attention to its ongoing work in
reviewing contemporary standards that
protect human research participants.”
 The investigation sparked the forma-
tion of the International Research Panel, a
subcommittee that will advise the commis-
sion on the effectiveness of curent federal
rules and the international standards for
human-based’ research. , ' —

The panel has met three times and will
print its ﬁndings and recommendations
in the Federal Register. The commission
will present a ﬁnal report to the President
‘in December.’ » '

Gutmann said in the release that the
ﬁnal report is meant to assure the Presi-
‘dent that “the current rules for research
participantspprotect people from harm.or

as internationally, is at the heart of the

Pitt general ed
system a “D”ud    

Pitt’s general-education system is
like a to-do list. Students check
off each mandatory task as they’
await the chance to fully commit
to subjects they actually like.

It’s a race to completion, but
what are we really getting from
sitting through class upon class of
subjects that have little applica-
tion to our lives? — ‘ ‘

Not much, according to the
American Council of Trustees and
Alumni, a nonproﬁt organization
whose mission includes promot-
ing high academic standards.

ACTA, whose board of direc-
tors includes doctors, lawyers
and professors, provided its
third-annual assessment of what
1,007 of the country’s colleges
teach students, and the results
weren’t pretty.

Three-ﬁfths of the colleges re-
ceived a grade of “C” or worse.

The study focuses on seven
categories of knowledge: com-
position, literature, foreign lan-
guage, U.S. government or his-
tory, economics, mathematics
and science. Each school’s grade
correlates to how many catego-
ries it passes. .

Pitt’s main campus got a “D,”

' only passing thecomposition and

science categories.

_ The rating doesn’t surprise us.
We think the general education
system needs a serious revamp-
ing.

First, by requiring students to
study multiple courses within a
certain area, i.e., natural science,
Pitt is depriving us of time that
could be spent exploring other
areas.

Streamlining the system into ,-

fewer e but broader — cat-
egories of learning would allow
students to’ explore new areas of

thought more quickly and effi-
ciently.

Second, requiring so many
subjects that take time from
students? primary interests too
often leads to taking the easy
way out.

General education require-
ments should virtually exist as a
guide for success. ACTA’s rubric,
for example, values collegiate—lev—
el foreign language and econom-
ics more than several classes in a
subject like international history,
and Pitt woulddo well to consider
such recommendations.

When bombarded with count-

less requirements, students in- '

evitably reach for the class that
will produce an “A,” not ones

that consume time in an area in

which they know they’re not in-
terested. L _
Finally, we think the current
system leaves both faculty and
students dissatisﬁed with their
general.-education experiences.

When students are forced into ’
several classes that have little .

application to their real-world

- knowledge and/or general inter-

ests, they just sit, They aren’t en-

‘ gaged, and they aren’t learning.

And instructors struggle, too.

They deserve to teach interested ‘

students. And as they teach stu-
dents who areforced to be there,
it’s almost certainly discouraging
to realize that the material they’re

passionate about is going to waste -

as it falls on uninterested ears.

We think fewer, broader gen-
eral education classes would
produce more enthusiastic, in-
tellectual students. After all, are
we here to learn things that make
us more valuable, educated citi-
zens_— or opt out of challenging
classes to get an ‘A’? I

 

Bateman: Onbreaking up

There are better, more creative ways to get out of a mediocre relationship, according to columnist Oliver

. Columnist

Now that the fall semester has ar-
rived, it’s time to begin thinking
about a fresh start. Whether you’re
an apple-cheeked freshman or a
weather-beaten, ninth-year senior,
you’ll never be able to start any-
thing if you’re stuck in the middle of
something — and by “something,”
we mean a stagnant relationship.
Paul Simon noted that there are 50
ways to leave your lover, but after
several clinical trials andmuch

ﬁeld research, we’ve realized that ‘

only four of those will enable you to
do a total romance reboot. Here’s
what we learned:

Vanish. Absence might make
the- heart grow fonder, but ato-
tal disappearance a la legendary
lost beauty Natalee Holloway or
airplane hijacker D.B. Cooper is
the ticket to commencing a new

to terminate a long-distance re-
lationship that’s costing you big
bucks on bus fares and plane tick-
ets —— cash you’re undoubtedly
eager to redirect to your PlaySta-

tion 3 and $5 pizza “discretion-
ary fund.” Simply “defriend” the
person on Facebook, block him
or her on your email and carry on
as if those months or years of fair-
to-middling times never even hap-
pened. Besides, who wants some-
body around who can remind you
of what aloser you were in high
school? Now that you’re racking up
those “Call of Duty” body counts
and running train on games of beer
pong, you’re a big person on cam-
pus — and no “blast from the past”
can tell you otherwise.

The nuclear option. If you’re
dating‘ someone you go to school
with and thus might encounter at
a party/rave/mosh pit/ﬂash mob/
etc., vanishing might prove im-
practicable. Instead — and those

of you with divorced parents will '

know where we’re coming from —
you’ll want to use the “nuclear op-
tion” to ensure that no bridges are
left standing after you beat a hasty
retreat. This one’s pretty easy: just

rible person who is bad at every-
thing? Also, I want to break up

Your -signiﬁcant other:,Where is
this coming from? I was just talking
about the trash! Take it easy, pal.

You: I wish we had never met,

that he or she will never want to

WOMEN'S soccen

Panthers earn ﬁrst win of season

Donnie Tasser
Staff Writer

Although the Pitt women’s soc-
cer team was outscored 6-1 in
two games, the Panthers emerged
from the James Madison Tourna-
ment with their ﬁrst victory of the
season. ‘ ~

In the ﬁrst game, the host school

» blanked the Panthers (1-2-1) 6-0 be-

hind a strong ﬁrst half. The James
Madison Dukes scored four goals in
a 15-minute span, notching scores
in the 31st, 33rd, 43rd and 44th minutes
without a response from Pitt.

’ The Dukes scored their ﬁrst goal
off a header by Haley Miller, follow-
ing with a Katie Hyland hard shot
to the lower left corner of the net.
Ariana Ruela scored the third goal

from the middle of the box. Hyland
ﬁnished the scoring surge with a
goal from six yards out to putjames
Madison ahead 4-0. '

They added two insurance goals
in the second half, putting the Pan-
thers out of reach. I

James Madison ﬁnished the
game with 29 shots,” including 10
shots on goal. Pitt goalkeeper Nicole
Dﬁgostino made three saves.

Pitt mananged just eight shots in
comparison, four on goal.

“Yes, it was an ugly loss, but it
was a turning point,” Pitt head coach V
Sue-Moy Chin said. “It shows our
character and our toughness. We’re
a young team and it would have been
easy to fold in that situation, to pack
it in, but we came back. The season
is still young and We’re going to con-

tinue to improve.” .

Pitt bounced back against the
Delaware Blue Hens, winning 1-0
behind the strength of Ashley Cu-
ba’s second goal of the year and a

combined shutout by goalkeepers p

Kristina Rioux and D’Agostino.

“That ﬁrst win was relieving, ab-
solutely relieving,” senior midﬁelder
Katie Ruhe said. “It was something
to pick us up after Friday night. It
helped us mentally, especially win-
ning 1-0.”

Cuba’s goal, which came in the
58”‘ minute on a pass off the head of
freshman Ali Matisse, is the 15”‘ of
her career, which ties her for third
all-time in Pitt women’s soccer his‘-
tory. She’s only four shy of the re-

Pitt to face defending champs

Torie Wytiaz
Sta_[fWri ter

The Pitt-Penn State football ri-
valry may be set to resume in
2016, but the Panther volleyball
team will take on the No. 2 Nit-
tany Lions as part of the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh Invitational this
weekend.
The four-time defending Na-

tional Champions last visited Pitt’s -

campus in 1991, although the two
teams have met since then. ‘

In 2003, the Panthers fell to
the Nittany Lions 3-1 in the second
round of the NCAA Tournament
and Penn State defeated Pitt 3-0
in the 2009 Penn State Tourna-
ment. ’

Despite recent struggles
against their cross—state oppo-
nent, the Panthers remain opti-
mistic about the 2011 match-up
and are excited to play a talented

” team. The Nittany Lions were

ranked No. 1 before their open-
ing game of the season when they

fell to then-unranked Oregon 3-1,
snapping a 94-game home win-
ning streak. _ _ '

Penn State bounced back the
next day, defeating then-No.2

Usc 3-2.

“Personally, I am looking for-

" ward to playing Penn State,” Mon-

ica Wignot, a sophomore outside,
hitter said. “Playing such a great

‘ team will allow our own team to

experience and compete at a high
level of play.”

Wignot,who was named MVP _
of last weekend’s Pitt Panther In-
vitational, will be a key offensive
factor for the Panthers. She re-
corded 43 kills and 29 digs as the
Panthers compiled a 4-0 record

V and earned the Invitational title.

The Nittany Lions have long-
beenga force in women’s collegiate
volleyballﬂau the 2011 squad is
unique in that 13 o he\17 ros-
ter members are freshmen an
sophomores. . ‘

“It certainly won’t be similar to
teamswe’ve’had_t‘he'last fewyears, -
where we’d enter a match and feel

we’ve had players with experience
winning the big matches,” Penn
State head coach/Russ Rose said
in a statement on the ‘team’s web
site. “We’ll be like a number of
young teams in the country and
will try and mature and develop,
establish a lineup that gives us the
best chance to be competitive.”

The Panthers are young as
well with a roster containing only
two seniors: middle hitter Lau-
ren Hartman and middle blocker
Keisha Leggs.

Pitt head coach Toby Rens said
he was impressed with the conﬁ-
dence of the underclassmen.

“Our freshmen and sopho-
mores have contributed so much
to the team, whether they are
starting or coming off the bench,”
Rens said ‘after the Panthers cap-
tured the Pitt Invitational cham-
pionship. “They have poise and a

ental focus that will serve them
iwel face strongcompeti-_
tion.” ,   ,

GREGORIAN RANTS

 

Graham brings high-octane football, but be patient

Greg Trietley
Senior Staﬁ Writer

A larger-than—life billboard of football
coach Todd Graham stands 10 feet from

, my apartment. “High—octane” has been

slapped on bus shelters and ﬂashed on
television. Student tickets, when sepa-
rated, are an eight-piece Graham puzzle,
and it’s not Ray.

There has never been more hype sur-

 

rounding an early season opponent, known
in the politically incorrect sports world as
a warm—up game, as Buffalo has provided
for the Pitt football team this Saturday.

For the number of mentions the simple
(yet lacking in appropriate synonyms)
phrase “high-octane” has received, no-
body is quite sure what Saturday will
bring. _

Since his hire in January, Graham’s
scheme has teased the masses. He men-
tioned the idea of running a reverse per

quarter. “Explosive touchdowns week in
and week out” were promised when he
addressed the'Oakland Zoo. At a practice
that was open to the media last Wednesday, .
quarterbacks Tino Sunseri and Trey An-
derson spent much of the practice punting.
Punting.‘And they’re pretty good at it.
But Graham is the ﬁrst to admit that
pages of his octane-scorching playbook
have been shufﬂed, ﬁled, purged and add-
ed. In his fourth year at Tulsa, with players
he recruited and fostered from the start,

he had,87 formations. I don?t think math
allows any more than that. .

The leading rusher on that team was
G.J. Kinne, which sounds like a pleasant
enough name. Kinne was (and still is) the
quarterback of the Golden Hurricane. Of

"l.A;_v:l4’_,<‘g"ourse,’Sunse1‘i_can’t do what Kinne can,
 he won’t attempt to. _ - v

 

Pitt’As"“high-octane” offense won’t be

.g7*:fI‘ulsa’s,, not that i-t should be. Graham said
{last Wednesdayafter practicetthat about A
 percent” of Tulsa’s offense appears «
 Pitt’s new strategy. Call it the:Golden
‘ — jg-Iurricane ratio. a " - V

At Pitt’s practices, 18 seconds between
plays has been the standard. Tulsa peaked
at 15 seconds. For the Panthers, it’s better
to go slow (comparatively) and tailor the
offense for Ray Graham, Mike Shanahan
and Sunseri than to shove a square peg in
a round hole, or to tell that square peg it
better memorize 87 round-hole forma-
tions by fall. . l "

On one hand, billboards, commercials

Q ‘and, I can only assume, airplane.-tether_ed A
,‘ Tibanners have promoted the livi-ng day-

lights out of Graham’s scheme. On the
other hand, Graham himself would prob-
ably add a footnote to the ad campaign:
“Please be patient.”

It will take months before this roster
fully understands the system and years
before the roster truly fits it. '

Graham built his scheme on risk-taking_ '

and believing that the benefits outweigh
the occasional loss. Think Troy Polamalu
— butfrom Texas. There will be downsides
— if not during Saturday’s game against
Buffalo, then certainly soon.

What’s the dream outcome for a Pitt fan
this Saturday? Perfection —— translated in
the sports world as one of those Big 12 v.
“formerly Division I-AA” romps in which
the highlights consist of one player out-
running 11 for six points on several occa-

 : , sions before the ﬁrst quarter ends.

A far more likely scenario: Pitt defeats
Buffalo by three touchdowns, Sunseri
throws an ‘interception, the defense has a
pick or two of its own, but it also gives up a

i  ' few big plays on miscalculated risks. Every
I  p fan leaves with some degree of mixed emo-

tions, and a select few probably clamor for
Anderson to start against Maine.
“High-octane” is almost mythical. It’s

j presented as if it’s football like we’ve never

seen it before, as if the Wildcat forma-
tion and Madden glitches reared a child.
Cornerbacks take snaps under center. In

y punt formation, the opposition suspects

everything except for a punt. Something
called a spur linebacker exists. '
All these things sound incredible. There
hasn’t been this kind of buzz —— and sheer
curiosity — in years. But these things also
take time. They call it midseason form
for a reason. That’s also why they have
warm-up games. I ' l
