Si mo Phi Epsilon
0/ egeci/y involved in
hazing incident

 Mark Gordon
4 Editor in Chief

Pitt fraternity Sigma Phi Epsilon has been suspended
indefinitely by its national office for a hazing -incident,

confirmed that the fraternity is being investigated by Pitt
for an incident that occured at an off-campus house on
Nov. 29.

“A review is underway of a fraternity possibly engag-

allegedly involving new brothers‘ and an abuse of alcohol. ‘
A representative at Sigma Phi Epsilon’s national office"

Fraternity under invesliguiion

. ing in misconduct,” said Assistant Vice Chancellor for

Student Affairs Dennis‘ Donham, although he wouldn’t
say which one was being investigated.

“The university is conducting their own investigation,
which I’m very supportive of,” said Jason St. John, an
official at Sigma Phi Epsilon’s national office in
Richmond, Va.

“It was a hazing incident involving four brothers and an

_abuse of alcohol,” St. John said. He said he didn’t know

exactly what the abuse of alcohol was.

“Within 24 hours, our office suspended the fraternity
indefinitely,” St. John said. “The charter responded very
well and removed the four individuals from the fraterni-
ty.”

The fraternity’s national office recently sent a letter to
Pitt’s office of student affairs concerning theincident.

Donharn said that, currently, there is no proof regarding

any wrongdoing by the fraternity Pitt is investigating.

touch with USSA, a national
lobbying group dedicated to
saving student aid, to find
out what he could do on
Pitt’s campus.

While in Washington,
Campbell worked with about
10 other interns, most of

‘ whom were activists and

campus leaders. The job of
the interns ranged from
doing literature drops on
Capitol Hill about student
funding to doing research
and attending hearings. ,

“Through my internship I
learned ‘that we [SGB]
shouldn’t be afraid to get
” said
“When we
past September, it was con-
troversial. We want to be
non-partisan, but not apoliti-
ca1.”

“We have a goal to main-
tain financial aid programs

, that benefit our constituents.

Whatever means we have to
use, we are going do it,” he
said. “We can’t be afraid to

S _ take a stand.”

If Campbell’s popularity
in the election was any
reflection of his stand, then
it paid off. Campbell had the
second-highest number of
votes out of 10 candidates in

last November’s- election,
winning him a second year
on the SGB.

Campbell hopes to contin-
ue his work with student aid.
He feels that 1996 is an
important year not only
because there will be more
proposed cuts to aid, but
also because it is an election

yean
,Campbell hails from
Glenolden, a suburb of

Philadelphia. He graduated
from Cardinal O’Hara High
School, where he first
became interested in student
government.

Because Campbell was
unsure of his major, he came
to Pitt, a large university
with many possibilities. He
was impressed by Pitt’s set-
ting as well.

“Pitt is in an urban area,
yet the pace of life in
Pittsburgh is a lot more laid-
back than larger cities like
New York and
Philadelphia,” he said. “I’ve
read reports, and through my
own experience, Philly is
known for being very hos-
tile. Pittsburgh is a lot
friendlier.” ’

Campbell hopes someday
to work as a congressional
st-affer in Washington. He
also wants to go to graduate
school for public policy or

public administration.

In his free time, he enjoys
cycling. He has gone on
tours to the Maine coast, and
he has ridden from New
York City to Montreal via
the Hudson Valley, Vermont
and French Canada. His
favorite tour was through the
San Diego-Palm Springs
area of California.

One of his most memo-
rable moments was on the
tour of French Canada.

Campbell and his riding
companion were halfway
between Montreal and
Quebec City when it started
to rain. They stopped at a
farm and asked the owners
in broken -French if they
could wait out the storm in
their barn. Instead of letting
them stay in the barn, they
took them into their house
and gave them lunch.

Not all of Campbell’s
cycling experiences have
been as pleasant as the
Canadian one. Once he was
traveling alone and was sup-
posed to meet the rest of the
group at a campground. He
ended up going to another
campground with a similar
name that was 20 miles out
of the way. It was dark and
in a remote area, but luckily
the State Police found him
and took him to right place.

  Opinions

Respect the ideals

Yesterday was a day of reflection, a day to honor a man who
made huge contributions to human and civil rights. But many
people did not have the opportunity to take time out for reflec-
tion, since they had to be up bright and early for class at Carnegie
Mellon.

CMU does not recognize Martin Luther King Day as a holiday,
or at least it does not close its doors to celebrate. And many peo-
ple are demanding that the school recognize the importance of
this day. .

CMU closes for Christmas, Thanksgiving and Easter but does
not acknowledge Martin Luther King Day or President’s Day
(a.k.a. Great American’s Day at Pitt). But many people argue that

three. Not everyone celebrates Christmas and Easter, and some

 even ignore Thanksgiving.

Those holidays are not a part of every culture or religion, but
schools and governments faithfully shut down to recognize them
anyway. Martin Luther King Day is something that affects every-
one. It is not just about celebrating the man because he was black,
but also because he made a great contribution to Americans in
general. His message was of love and cooperation between all
races, religions and creeds. Dr. King’s message affects the lives of
every American, directly or indirectly. CMU should recognize the
importance of celebrating this man, not to be “politically correct,”

_ but rather out of respect for a great man and a great ideal.

Avoidable accident?

 Friday morning Pittsburgh had one of the worst transit disasters

anyone can remember. Two buses crashed head on into each other
on the Martin Luther King Jr. Busway, killing one of the drivers
and injuring more than 50 others. Injuries from the accident
ranged from minor scrapes to critical conditions, and several peo-
ple had to be hospitalized.

’ City officials are still uncertain about the cause of the accident.

'\

Icy road conditions were originally blamed, but Port Authority
Transit claimed the busway had been plowed and salted three
times between midnight and 6:30 a.m. when the accident hap-
pened.
A, Since Friday morning, new information has been discovered
about the bus driver who survived the accident. PAT officials
released information stating that Kevin Ford, 42, was working
under a “last chance” agreement with PAT. He had previously
been charged by PAT authorities for numerous offenses, including
insubordination and drug and alcohol abuse.
So the question now arises: Would the accident have been pre-
V vented if Ford had not been driving the bus? If icy roads had
something to do with the accident, was Ford driving too fast or
too carelessly for conditions? It might seem that the previous
charges against Ford would have been enough for PAT to suspend
him from driving a public bus. Hopefully this tragic accident will
force transit officials to take action against employees who might
pose a serious risk to public safety every time they get behind the
wheel.

Do we deserve

Recently I’ve seen signs in
Oakland and Squirrel Hill
demanding that Carnegie Mellon
University President Mehrabian
make Martin Luther King Jr.’s
birthday a campus holiday.

But to someone like myself,
long an admirer of Dr. King, the
question should be: Do we, as a
society, deserve a King holiday?

I’ve believed for some time

that Dr. King’s real message has .

been perverted to justify extrem-
ist political agendas on both
sides. Black militants insist that
his campaigns against segrega-
tion took place primarily to give
blacks political and economic
power (which they will tell you
they still don’t have), while
some conservatives have sug-
gested that not much more needs
to be done. _

Both sides, in my estimation,
are wrong. In fact, Dr. King’s
purpose wasto reconcile people
separated by color, culture or
class. That’s why the civil rights
movement at that time wel-
comed whites’ involvement.
(These days, sadly, they’re being
told in many instances to butt
out. Foolish move.)

Consider that in the 1950s,
actively preaching justice and
equality in the Deep South
required tremendous courage;
King’s predecessor as pastor of
the Dexter Avenue Baptist
Church in Montgomery, Ala.
had been run out of town for
doing just that. The congregation
probably looked at him askance
when he referred to “our white
brothers” in his sermons on
social justice. In fact, one 50—ish
black man I talked to originally
thought that he was one of the
biggest “Uncle Toms” going.
(He knows better now.)

The Gandhian concept of
satyagraha (a Sanskrit word
which roughly translates into
“love-force”), which Dr. King
adapted as an essential tenet of
nonviolent direct resistance,
should clarify his intentions. In a
sennon titled “Loving your ene-
mies,” he said that the cam-

paigns against injustice were not
really about defeating enemies
but about making friends.
Referring to President Lincoln’s
secretary of war, a man named
Stanton who had previously
hated Lincoln, he said, ‘‘If
Lincoln had [mutually] hated
Stanton, both men would have
gone to their graves as bitter ene-
mies. But through the power of
love Lincoln transformed an
enemy into a friend.”

I don’t hear that today. Some
blacks want to believe that, had
Dr. King survived that bullet in
Memphis nearly 28 years ago,
he would have taken more of a
confrontational, Malcolm X-
style approach to civil rights. I
say, “Get real!”

For, in fact, nonviolence was
about not responding in kind to
the violence done to him and his
followers. His home was blown
up several times, and he was
nearly stabbed to death in
Chicago, not to mention the
numerous arrests and phone
threats. Yet he continually
admonished his audience, to bor-
row from Booker T.
Washington, not to “let anyone
pull you so low as to make you
hate him.” If something works,
why change? In fact, the Ku
Klux Klan bombed that black
church in Birmingham, Ala. in
1963, killing four girls, precisely
because it wanted to provoke the
black community to violence.

I recall his last sermon, the
night before he was assassinated,
in which he declared, “I have
seen  the Promised Land!”

wen, He's

a King holiday?

Well, I have not only seen the
Promised Land, I have actually
walked its streets. I have drunk
deeply of the‘ succulent milk of
justice and filled my belly with
the sweet, sweet honey of recon-
ciliation which only exists in the
Promised Land.

“Why can’t we go to the
Promised Land?” you may ask.

Again, wrong question. The
real issue is: are you ready?

If you aren’t willing to forgive
and forget the past, still holding
onto bitterness and resentment,
you aren’t ready for the
Promised Land.

If you think of a white person
with authority as a “racist
oppressor,” you aren’t ready for
the Promised Land. 7

If you think the way to obtain
justice is by answering insult
with insult, you aren’t ready for
the Promised Land.

If you believe in racial solidar-
ity uber alles, you aren’t ready
for the Promised Land.

And if you call those people
who seek to build up the com-
munity “sellouts” and “honky-
lovers,” you especially aren’t
ready for the Promised Land.

Because the Promised Land is
more a state of mind than an
actual physical place; it requires
spiritual cleansing before you
can enter in. If that doesn’t hap-
pen, the milk of justice will cur-
dle and the honey of reconcilia-
tion will be so much excrement
~—- that is, you will neither want
nor recognize it. Why did
ancient Israel take 40 years to
enter its Promised Land after
leaving Egypt? Because Israel
hadn’t abandoned the old ways!

So the issue isn’t whether
CMU or anyone else takes a ho]-
iday in Dr. King’s memory; it’s
whether we will commit our-
selves to the principles of love.
justice and reconciliation that he
lived, fought and eventually died
for. If not, we’re wasting our
time — not to mention his name.

Pitt beats Notre
Dame 75-65 for

fifth consecutive win

By Sean Duncan
Managing Editor

 

he NCAA is obvious-
I 1y run by people who
see one thing —
money. Those dollar signs
have always come before
common sense, but the
Lawrence Phillips fiasco
seems to have taken the
NCAA to a new level of
stupidity.

The NCAA is full of rules
that are designed to protect
the amateur status of its
game. Steve Kerr, Steve
Alford and Garrick Thomas
sure know that. But some-

. how,‘ girlfriend-beating

Nebraska running back
Phillips has not even been
touched by the NCAA suits.

Kerr, a shooting guard on
the 1988 Arizona Final Four
team, learned his lesson the
hard way.

Kerr”s mom lived and
worked ‘in Beirut during his
college years. After he led
the ‘Cats to an upset over
North Carolina in a great
eight game, Kerr wanted to
call his mom.

CBS offered Kerr free use
of its phone if they could
televise the call on national
television, but the NCAA
killed that plan. You can’t
accept gifts when you play
college hoops.

Former Indiana Hoosier
guard Steve Alford, star of

L . the 1987 Hoosier national

championship team, is vic-
tim number two of a long
list. During his sophomore
year under Bob Knight, he
agreed to pose, in uniform,
for a calender that would be
sold for a children’s charity.
No way, said the NCAA.
Alford, unaware of the
pending doom of the NCAA
henchmen, went forward
with his charity work. He
was suspended for a game,
not a good thing when Bob’
Knight is your head coach.
And Pitt’s Garrick
Thomas suffered the wrath
of the NCAA two years ago
when he accepted a gift. It

‘ wasn’t a Porsche or

Mercedes. It wasn’t even a
new pair of Nikes.

°Column, page 9

It has taken Notre Dame 97 years to scrap its indepen-
dent status and finally join a conference. And judging by
the Irish’s performance, it might take them another 97
years to have a winning record in the Big East. .

Notre Dame’s (5-7, 0-5) latest setback came last
Saturday afternoon when the streaking Pitt Panthers hand— :'
ed the Irish a 75-65 loss at the Civic Arena. ‘

“We’re growing into the Big East,” Notre Dame Coach
John McLeod said. “We’re finding out that it’s just as dif-
ficult as we thought, perhaps even a little bit more.”

The win was Pitt’s fifth in a row, as the Panthers raise
their season mark to 8-3 and 3-1 in Big East play.

The game, however, started off slowly for Pitt. The
Panthers were held scoreless for almost the first five min-
utes of the game. Forward Chad Varga broke the scoring
drought with a three—pointer in the corner to cut Notre
Dame’s lead to 4-3.

After exchanging baskets, turnovers and overall lethar-
gic play for the next 12 minutes, Pitt held a 24-23 advan- .
tage with 3:08 left in the half. I

But then Pitt dialed up its defensive pressure as the
Panthers went on a 7-0 run to close out the half. Kevin
Willard started it off with a give-and-go jumper from
Varga. Then Pitt forced a lO—second backcourt violation,
followed by a pair of Gerald Jordan free throws. With 1:04
left, Willard netted a 3-pointer from the top of the key to ‘
give Pitt a 30-23 lead going into halftime.

“I thought our guards did a good job all game,” Pitt
Coach Ralph Willard said. “Our big people struggled all
day.” Willard was referring to his two main big men,
Jordan and Varga. Collectively they scored 16 points,

 

grabbed seven boards and committed nine fouls.

The Panthers continued their late first-half run into the

game against Notre Dame.

finished it off with an uncontested layup. Then McCullough hit had four steals.

The Pitt women’s basketball team
lost its llth consecutive game
Saturday, falling to Villanova 83-64.

The loss dropped the Lady Panthers
to 1-14 and 0-6 in the Big East, while
Villanova won its ninth game in a
row, raising its record to 11-3 overall
and 5-2 in conference play.

“It’s like we’re not playing,” said
Pitt point guard J o] o Guzman. “We’re
having a hard time right now, and a
lot of it has to do with our confi-
dence.”

The Lady Wildcats jumped out to a
9-0 lead in the first two minutes of
the game, and Pitt couldn’t recover.
The Lady Panthers only shot 35 per-
cent from the field and went into half-
time trailing Villanova 38-21.

“They had a big lead on us in the
beginning, and a lot of our players
got down,” said Guzman, who fin-
ished with seven points and four
assists.

Sophomore center Latia Howard
led the Lady Panthers with 12 points
and added five rebounds in only 15
minutes of play.

Forward Kelly Seneca and fresh-
man guard Gina Montesano also had

strong games, finishing with nine
points apiece. Each connected on two
three-pointers.

The Lady Wildcats had a“ trio of
players who scored in double figures,
led by Denise Dillon’s 24 points.
Point guard Sue Glenning connected
on three of five three-pointers and
finished with 18 points. Jenn Beisel
also added 18 points, hitting on seven
of eight from the field.

“Villanova is a very offensive
team,” Guzman said. “There were
points we did look good on defense
and stop them, and then we’d get too
lax. It wasn’t a consistent thing.”

Dillon, a senior forward who is
averaging 15.7 points pergame and
16.4 in league play, led Villanova
with eight rebounds.

The Lady Panthers’ l-14 record is
the slowest start in the history of the
program, which started in 1974-75.
Their last win came against Robert
Morris on Dec. 2.

Pitt plays at Georgetown tomorrow
night.

“We need a win, and if we can beat
Georgetown that will solve a lot of
problems,” Guzman said. “Not only
would it be a win, it would be a win
on the road, and it would bring back
some confidence.”

Garrity emerges as Bi

By Brad Isles
Sports Editor

There haven’t been very
many bright spots for Notre
Dame’s basketball team this
season. It’s a team trying to step
out from behind the shadow of
the most popular figures in
South Bend, Ind.
Touchdown Jesus, Lou Holtz
and Ron Powlus.

It hoped to accomplish this by
joining perhaps the best colle-
giate athletic conference in the
“country — the Big East — this
year. But what the Irish have
found out is that they have a
long way to go before the glim-
mer of the golden dome shines
on them.

“We’re growing into the Big
East,” said Irish Coach John
McLeod. “We’re ﬁnding out it’s
just as difficult as we thought,
perhaps even a little bit more.
This is what makes the league
the league that it is.”

Pitt kept Notre Dame winless
in the conference at 0-5, hand-
ing the Irish a 75-65 defeat
Saturday.

The game would have been
more in Pitt’s favor if it weren’t
for forward Pat Garrity, a 6-
foot-9 sophomore from
Monument, Colo.

Coming into the game,
Garrity led the Irish and was
11th overall in the conference in
scoring with 16.1 points per
game and eighth in league scor-
ing at 16.3. He also led the team
in rebounding, averaging 6.5 per
game.

Against Pitt he tied a career
high with 27 points, connecting
on eight of 13 field goals. He

 

was also per
feet from the
foul line, going
10-for-10, and  
he grabbed six
r e b 0 u n d s
before fouling
out with 46
seconds left in
the game. V ~

“He did an "
excellent job,” -
McLeod said.  ‘
“This was an
encouraging .
sign for us ‘ ,
because he had ‘
been strug
gling. He was
active pound E’
ing the boards.
He made his
shots, his free
throws, and he
had a very good
rhythm.”

G a r r i t y
scored '21 of his points in the
second half. His 10 free throws
also came in the period, largely
because Pitt got in early foul
trouble, putting Notre Dame in
the bonus at the 15:37 mark of
the second period.

During a nine-minute stretch,
Garrity scored 19 of Notre
Dame’s 23 points on his 10 foul
shots, a jumper in the lane, a 3-
pointer from the right baseline,
a turnaround jumper from the
right elbow and an eight-foot
jumper from the right baseline.

“That’s part of coach’s philos-
ophy,” Garrity said about his
range as a shooter. “If you have
the open shot, take it.”

who scored 16 points off the

Chad Varga guards Notre Dame’s Pat
Garrity in Saturday’s game.

Irish bench, “Pat’s been that
way the last two years. He steps
up every game.”

“He can handle the ball really
well, and he has a good outside
shot, so he’s a threat inside and
out,” said Pitt center Gerald
Jordan. “Plus he has a big body,
so he’s pretty hard to move.
He’s deﬁnitely going to be a ter-
ror in the Big East.”

On a team with only two
seniors, Garrity has established
himself as Notre Dame’s go-to
player. If the holy light of the
Big East Gods shines on the
Irish at all this year, it will be
shining directly on him.

slam. Minutes later Pitt hit
the Irish with another run.

Garrick Thomas (12 points)
swung around a pick to hit a
jumper. After a Jordan put-
back and an Andre Howard
jumper, the Panthers opened
up a 14-point lead with 15:51
left, forcing Notre Dame to
call a timeout.

After the timeout, Willard,
who scored eight points and
dished out seven assists,
nailed a runner to culminate a
quick 8-0 run and gave Pitt its
largest lead of the game.

But the Irish crept back,
thanks mostly to Pitt putting
Notre Dame in the bonus with
15:37 remaining in the game.
Sophomore forward Pat
Garrity was the main benefi-
ciary of Pitt’s hacking prob-
lems. Garrity went a perfect
10-for-10 from the free throw
line in the second half. He tal-
lied 21 of his game-high 27
points in the second frame
and single—handedly kept the
Irish from getting blown out.

“He’s a hell of a player,”
Willard said of Garrity. “He’s
only a sophomore. He’s a
heck of a player right now;
he’s going to be a real heck of
a player in the next couple of
years. He’s really talented.”

After seven Notre Dame
free throws without a Pitt
score, the Irish cut Pitt’s lead
to 47-38 with 10:06 left to go.

But then McCullough start-
ed to get his groove on. After
almost a four-minute score-
less span, McCullough iced a

key 3—pointer in the corner
and followed it up with
another 3—pointer in the same
spot to ignite his team and the
12,758 fans in attendance.

Garrity did his best to stop
Pitt’s bum-rush, scoring Notre
Dame’s next 11 of 13 points,
but it was too late.

McCullough capped off his .

second half heroics by sink-
ing seven of eight free throws
in the last minute of the
game.

“We didn’t have the same
focus or the same emotion we
had on Wednesday night
[against Georgetown],” Ralph
Willard said.

“A win is a win,” Kevin
Willard said. “I think if we
beat UMass tonight, he
[Ralph Willard] would still be
mad about something.”

Column

°From page 6

It was a ticket to a Pittsburgh Pirates game. For
that major offense, Thomas ended up being sus-
pended for a game.

But there are no rules for punishing girlfriend‘
beaters. Maybe the NCAA" is worried about dou-
ble jeopardy. Maybe they figure the justice sys-
tem does a good enough job taking care of these
offenders. (O.J who?) It’s not the NCAA’s
responsibility — that’s probably its line of think-
ing.

. Look closely at the Phillips situation. The
Nebraska tailback was a key player in the past
two Nebraska championship teams. But this past_
season he was absent for a few games in the mid-
dle of the season. _

Phillips was suspended indefinitely by
Cornhusker Head Coach Torn Osborne after he
was arrested for beating up his girlfriend, who’s
on the NU women’s basketball team.

Osborne started off in the right direction by sus-
pending Phillips. I believe a coach has to make a

decision on what type of people his players are
going to be, whether the sport is football or cro-
quet. It seemed like Osborne made that decision;
girlfriend beaters are not Cornhusker material.

But he forgot that this Cornhusker could put the
football in the end zone. So after six games,
Phillips was back on the Nebraska sideline.
Osborne went as far as to encourage his star run-
ning back to apply for the NFL draft, saying he
didn’t deserve to play his senior year under such
media scrutiny.

Good call, coach. There’s really no need to
scrutinize a 20-year-old college student who beat
his girlfriend, missed six regular season games
and was the star of the national championship
game.

But Osborne, although his logic with the
Phillips situation is questionable, is not the true
guilty party here.

The real culprit is the NCAA. Where was it dur-
ing this whole mess? Looking at Steve Kerr’s
phone bills? Checking each page of the Indiana

University calendar?
It’s probably in some cigar smoke-filled room
with a bunch of television sets, watching Wake

Forest’s All-American center Tim Duncan accept.

a Tic-Tac from a Demon Deacon fan.

It’s really good that college sports has an orga-
nization like the NCAA to regulate the athletes.

By the way, don’t kid yourself — Phillips isn’t
running this bit solo. He’s on a pretty longlist of
girlfriend-beating college athletes who just con-
tinue on into the pros.

What the NCAA needs to do is stop staring at’
the green dollar signs in front of it and do what's
right. It’s real simple: If you pull a Lawrence
Phillips, then the first place you should be run-
ning is through the exit door.

It’s about time an organization as powerful as
the NCAA takes a stand and puts an end to
domestic violence perpetrated by its athletes.
