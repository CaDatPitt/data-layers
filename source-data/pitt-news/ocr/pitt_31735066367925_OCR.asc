Welcome
To Pitt,
Sort Of

Oh, the trials and tribula-
tions of going to school in the
middle of a large city.

A freshman hitchhiked from
Erie. Pa., with his trusted
canine companion to register
for fall classes last week. He tied
the dog up outside the Regis-
trar's ()ffice, where some cruel
person untied it, leaving it to
roam the unfamiliar streets of
Oakland.

When the CGS student came
out and saw his dog missing, he
asked someone to watch his
backpack and left in hot pursuit
of the dog.

He didn't find his dog, and
when he went back to where he
left his things, he found his
wallet, identification and all his
other possessions had been
stolen.

The man told his tale of woe :

to Robin Weschitz in the Regis-
trar's Office and she tried to
help him as best as she could.
The dog was found later in

Pitt's faculty union, the United
Faculty, «already has enough
authorization cards to petition for
a vote on collective bargaining, but
it will continue this terrnto try and
reach a majority of the faculty.
»Co-president Philip Wion said
the union has collected 420 cards
from the approximately 1,300
faculty members in the provost
area, which includes the Faculty of
Arts and Sciences, regional cam-

 puses, the departments of engineer-

ing, education and social work,
and the Graduate School of Public
and International Affairs.

“Our plans are to conduct a con-
centrated card drive in the next six
or eight weeks, or as long as it takes
to reach a majority of the faculty,”
Wion said. ‘

Faculty who sign the authoriza-
tion cards do not become members
of the United Faculty, but the Uni-
ted Faculty must get at least 30 per-
cent of the faculty to sign the cards
in order for it to petition the Penn-
sylvania Labor Relations Board
(PLRB) for a vote on whether the
union will have collective bargain-
ing, and if so, who the bargaining
agent will be.

If the petition is approved, hear-
ings will be conducted on the defi-
nition of the unit. The decision
will then be put to the faculty for a
vote. . .

Wion is hoping the United
Faculty will be able to petition the
PRLB before the end of the term.

BoardDecides Funding

Accepts BAS Emergency Requests

By LAURIE ‘MacLEOD

The Student Government Board
(SGB) accepted two emergency
requests from the Black ‘Action
Society (BAS) totalling $5,000 and
discussed notions of funding floats
in the homecoming parade this fall
at the first SGB meeting of the term
held Tuesday.

Allocations Committee chair-
man James Shelton recommended
funding the BAS emergency
request of $3,000 for Bill Russell to
speak during.Black Week.

BAS requested funding for this
speaker last Winter term for $3,500
but is now able to hire him for
$3,000, according to Shelton.

SGB accepted this request
unanimously along with funding a
dance group for Black Week for
$2,000.

SGB president Todd DeLuca
proposed a policy for funding
floats for the homecoming parade.

If the proposal is accepted,
according to DeLuca, the funding
policy will follow these conditions:

ONO more than three floats per
governance group.

OGroups must have a location
for building.

eGroui:>s must have a facility for

the float to be made on.

O(}roups must attend a float
building seminar sponsored by the
Pitt Program Council. «

T 0(}roups must apply and be,
accepted be the Pitt Program
Council to participate in the
parade. A '

I)eLuca said his reason for fund-
ing the floats is that students expect
this parade, but no money is given
to support it.

“It's for the community to see
and it does something for Pitt's
football program,” he said.

He also said it adds a feeling of
community to Pitt, and if the PPC
eliminates the parade it will take
away what little community there
is.

Homecoming chairperson Mar-
gie Taleff said last year’s floats
were not up to_ par and there was a
problem getting organizations
involved.

“It comes down to a money prob-
lem,” she said, “and if SGB helps,
the parade might be more profes-
sional and add a “group
consciousness.” g

The proposal will be discussed at
the next SGB meeting, which was
not announced at yesterday's
meeting.

In other business, board member
Linda O’Connor introduced an
amendment to the SGB by—laws.
The amendment says each stand-
ing committee will pick its own
chairperson, who will be approved
or rejected by SGB. If he is rejected
the committee will.have two weeks
to submit .another nomination.
This business will be tabled until
the next SGB meeting.

Delsuca announced the resigna-
tion of the Chairpersons of the
lCommuter Affairs Committee,
Robin Kropf; the Legal Awa_reness
Committee, Carla Taylor; and the
Academic Affairs Committee,
Mary Tabasko.

He also said he received a letter
from the Ice Hockey Club asking
for financial support. 1

The letter stated the expansion
of the club and mentioned efforts to
find alternative ways of funding,
such as increasing initiation fees,
organizing fund raisers and selling
ads.

“Without your help the Hockey
Club will die and end a great tradi-
tion,” the letter said.

DeLuca said the Hockey Club
will attend the next meeting plan-
ning session to discuss the
situation. ‘

Motorists and students alike were caught by
suprise when a Wagon Train was seen in aking its
way down Forbes Avenue then up Bellefield yester-
day. The train was staged by Vision Quest, an
organization for juvenile delinquents out of
Franklin, Pa. The members have been traveling

DeLuca Proposal“:

.u.sl»‘l 21}? -,-HT

Make Commuter Affairs
A Governance Group

The Commuter Affairs Com-
mittee, now a standing commit-
tee of the Student Government
Board, would be designated as a
governance group if a proposal
by Student Government Board
president Todd DeLuca is
accepted.

The change in status would
most likely mean increased
funding and autonomy for the
committee, A which schedules
activities and publishes a news-
paper for Pitt commuters.

DeLuca said he decided to
propose the change because he
believes the committee meets
the guidelines of a governance
‘group. Governance groups
must represent a large group of
students who have special
interests.

Other governance groups at
Pitt include: the Black Action
Society, the Nursing Student
Organization, the Engineers
and Greeks.

“The commuters represent a

7

constituency all their own,’
DeLuca said. “They're the only
standing committee that has
responsibility to students other
than those connected with the
Student Government Board.”

The boards eight standing
committees, such as the Legal
Awareness Committee and the
Governmental Relations Com-
mittee, are answerable to the
board. Their chairmen are
selected and approved by the
board. They also are restricted
in their use of advertising and
programming.

Govrenance group status
would allow the Commuter
Affairs Committee to hold a
Commuter Week, similar to
Black or Greek Week. More
importantly, it would give
them the power to endorse can-
didates in the SGB elections.

“The change would allow us
a lot more autonomy,” said
Commuter Affairs chairman

Joseph Leah. He added his
committee supports such a
change and forsees little_ oppo-
sition to it.

The addition of an eighth
governance group would put a
strain on student activity fee
money, which funds student
activities, DeLuca said. He
added, however, that he believes
the need for larger commuter
representative organization is a
priority.

“I don't plan on letting
finances dictate decisions made
about them (the Commuter
Affairs Committee),” DeLuca
said.

The Student Government
Board would have to approve
the change before it could
become effective, DeLuca said.
He said he is optimistic the
board will vote to change the
(:omrnittee's status so it will be
able to operate as a governance
group by Winter term.

  athedral Sub-Base-

ment: A Different
OrJusz‘ Like Home

By MICHAEL ROKNICK

Perhaps it would have
been best to build without
thought. That way, we
would have been ahead of
the ‘Europeans. Some,
such as Tom Wolfe, have
concluded that Ameri-
cans have been building
this way for decades. One
such example is Pitts-
burgh’s Cathedral of
Learning. Maybe the
Cathedral was caught in
that vague period of
architecture, somewhere
between prehistoric and
modern.

It is hard for Americans
in the 20th century to
believe that slaves, with
some help of the Egyp-
tians, built the Sphinx. It
would be even more diffi-
cult for the ancient
builders to grasp that 20th
century Americans could

build the sub—basement of
the Cathedral.

Webster’s Dictionary
defines sub—basement as
“a basement located
"below the true basement
of a building." This sug-
gests that a sub-basement
is a lie. In walking the
Cathedral’s sub—basement
though, it is certain that it
is below the truth, the
truth in this case being
the true basement.

Walking down to the
sub—basement, one recalls
two quotes that can be
related to it. The first
coming from Frank
Lloyd Wright. (an Ameri-
can architect), calling the
Cathedral “an inverted
mine shaft.” Yes, but
inverted? /

The second quote
comes from Theodore
Sturgeon‘ (an American
fiction wwriter), who said

§\~.-,

' "§:-.\ \ \\

“90 percent of everything
is crud.” In this case,the
percentage may be under-
estimated, but it’s the
thought that counts.
Like a long—lived pain-
ter, the sub—basement has
had its own unique peri-
ods. Let’s take a stroll and
examine the periods in
the sub-basement’s life.

The New York City
Subway Period

An interesting period
in the sub—basement’s life.
Note the dimly lit over-
hanging lights, the black
spray paint marks on the
crumbling walls, the
uneven floor and the rum-
bling of machines. And
like the New York sub-
way, it has commuters
(not employees) who
would make the Elephant
Man feel at ease.

The Early American

\

Outhouse Period

This was the depress-
ing period in the sub-
basement’s life. The
uncleaned toilet and lack
of tissue paper tell of its
hard economic times. It is
disappointing that even a
Sear’s catalogue couldn’t
be found in a time of need.
The flies buzzing
throughout the area
along with the stench
gives it a realistic flavor.

The Bobby Socks
Period

The latest of the sub-
basement’s evolving peri-
ods is this trip through
nostalgia. In looking
down the hallway at the
almost antique lockers,
one is reminded of differ-
ent decades. Goldfish
swallowing, flag-pole sit-
ting and sock hops are
only among the few
instances of this time

gone by. A girl in bobby
socks, ponytail and white
blouse walks arm in arm
with _,her boyfriend. He
has a crewcut and wool
knit sweater with the
color and letter of his
school sewn on the side.
The two spend weekend
nights at the passion pits,
where one day they will be
pinned.

This period is too
memorable for the old
and not so understood by
the young. Once we move
out of this period there is
nothing left of the sub-
basement.

In reality‘, there is a
theatre, mailroom and
workshop. But, there is
nothing more to add to
the senses. Perhaps this
cavern can best be des-
cribed not as a place that
time forgot, but as a place
where time takes its
vacation. ,

Opinion

‘F

The Art of

“G Elimination

It’s ironic that the geography department, which had
been uncertain about its future for s() many years, now is

sure of what course it will follow—but‘only because it is ‘

being dismantled.

Once the decision to eliminate a department has been
made, university- procedures for phasing it out are rela-
tively clear-cut and outlined in a university ‘document
called the Planning Resource and Management System.
There are likely to be, however, certain decisions that have
to be made regarding what will happen to certain teaching
assistants, graduate students, etc., but the whole procedure
is, on paper, rather orderly and concise.

It’s unfortunate that "Pitt can so carefully plan ‘ the
mechanics of eliminating a department while at the same
time it ignores the larger questions that inevitably arise
with such a decision. . .

In the case of the geography department, there are many
such ‘questions that apply not only to the department but
also to the status and input other departments will have if
they find themselves facing a similar fate. '

Perhaps the most important question raised by the
department's position is that of input. Specifically, who
makes the decision that a department should be cut, and
how is that decision made? Remember that a total of three
faculty committees recommended that the geography
department not be eliminated. Among the three was a
special faculty ad—hoc committee established to study the
‘matter and recommend future ‘action.

The decision itself was made, or at least announced, by
Faculty of Arts and Sciences dean Jerome Rosenberg.
Whether Rosenberg actually made the decision or has
been appointed to take the heat for the actions of higher
level administrators is- uncertain. It is known that Chan-
c_ellor Wesley Posvar must approve the elimination. of a

_department for it to become effective.

In addition, how much information should a depart-
ment be given about its own future? Regardless of the
merits of the elimination decision, geography students
have a point when they complain they were misled about

~ what the university had planned for the department. Is it

very wise—or fair-—to give an unsubstantiated, optimistic
report to undergraduates and graduates, who will then
invest their time and money in a school actually planning
to eliminate their major? Given achoice, it’s doubtful that
faculty and students of other departments wh'ould want to
be left in the dark about what may happen to them in th'e
future. '

Whether the department should be eliminated or not is
not the only issue here. Both sides in the issue argued
about enrollment figures, research quality, relative merit
and so on. If anything, the geography case illustrates the
haphazard‘, behind closed doors attitude that the univer-
sity employs in making decisions that affect its own
faculty and students. Such an attitude may lead to suspi-
cion and distrust. By informing the geography depart-
ment of its plans, the university might have avoided some
of the criticism it received for telling the department in
1977. it would revitalize it when it actually had no inten-
tion of doing so.

From the uproar and concern caused by the university’s
handling of the geography department, it can be hoped
that other departments someday caught in the same pre-
dicament will be treated with more fairness, respect and
candor.

Football and College A Pair?

By CHRISTINA LINTON

Pitt Panther tball.

’ Those three ords have been
known to incite excitement in
the hearts of football lovers and
,non—football lovers alike.

What student hasn’t looked
forward to those chilly days in
the student section of Pitt Sta-
dium cheering the Panthers on
to victory?

It’s strange how a group of
over-sized boys chasing a ball
around can bring thousands of
students together for three
hours every Saturday afternoon
in the fall.

Maybe it’s our times. We
don’t have a Vietnam to protest
against and the National Guard
isn’t beating our peers on the
green lawns of our campus; life
is serene atgcollege all around
the nation. ‘

Should it be serene? Is there
really no issue for which college
students can crusade? President,
Reagan is cutting financial aid
left and right, and where are the
students? Getting drunk at foot-
ball stadiums.’

Last March, Pitt’s Student
Government Board sponsored a
lecture with various govern-
ment officials attending in
hopes
understand the cuts. It was a
chance for Pitt students’ voices
to be heard. Pittsburgh televi-
sion stations and newspapers
were there to record the historic
event. The student turnout was
so low, it was an embarrassment
to our school.

Yet, if one thinks back several
months earlier to a time when
another student gathering also
made, the news, it is even more
embarrassing. A pep rally held
in Schenley Quad nights before
the Pitt-Penn State game was
attended by many more stu-
dents than the lecture on finan-
cial aid.

It seems as if there is a definite
problem with our generation.
We may have gambled our col-
lege education for a few cheap
thrills in the football stands. I

What's wrong with us? Some
will blame television, others,
the general apathy that is grip-
ping the youth of ~ today.
Obviously, there is no clear
answer to this paradox—l)ut
something is definitely wrong.
How can a football team unite
30,000 students when more vital
issues, like our futures, are
shrugged off?

Sure, there are a few who
don’t go to football games and
are writing their Congressmen,
but they are in the minority. If
the energy that is generated at
Pitt Stadium would be trans-

of_ helping students_

ferred to more worthwhile
causes, who knows what might
be accomplished.

Pitt students, as well as our
colleagues around the country,
need to stand up and be
counted. We do have a voice-
we are. the future leaders. Why
don’t we act the part? If students
would just take a small chunk
of their time—say, when the
Panthers are playing out of
town—to voice their protests,
we might make a mark on the
world.

o

Of course, we won't be able to
move mountains, but at least
our representatives will know
we’re alive, and we can begin to
mold the country for when we
are the lea_ders. Dan Marino et
al, will only be around for a
short time on the football field;
we have our whole lives to
watch out for.

Will I be at the Pitt-North
Carolina game tomorrow
night? You bet. I wouldn’t mis
it for the world.

 Rubbing Elbows With One of Pitt's Own Celebrities

‘.

  

By LARRY LUNSFORD

Everyone is a little awed at times
by celebrities. Some people get a
little too crazy, like all those
screaming girls shown in the film
clips of Beatles concerts in the
l960’s. Other folks just like to get a
quick handshake or perhaps an
autograph. I guess that I fall in the
latter category.

I had the opportunity yesterday
to have lunch with a local celebrity,
former Pittsburgh Pirate great,
Frankie Gustine, who, along with
his two brothers-in-law, Owen and
Bill Gormley, has run the Oakland
restaurant with the same name as
the former Pirate for 31 years.

The restaurant has been one of
my regular lunching and night
partying places since I moved to
Pittsburgh five years ago. I've

grown to be good friends with’

night manager, Bill ()ehling, and
it was at his invitation that I was
able to have the meeting with Fran-
kie. I had never met him before
even though I had been in his res-
taurant dozens of times. I was
pleased a couple of years ago when
the restaurant was remodeled and
much of Frankie’s memorabilia
from his professional baseball
career was made part of the estab-
lishment’s decor.

Our meeting originally was set
as a business luncheon, but I found
the afternoon to be more pleasure
than business. Right away, Frankie
and I began talking about Knox-
ville, Tennessee-—my native state
and the hometown of my. under-
graduate alma mater. He first
played in the minors there in 1939.

‘He told me about making less than

$250 a month, being broke and
having to skip out on a hotel bill
when he later was sent to another
minor team in Gadsden, Alabama
before being called to the big-
league Pittsburgh Pirates. Frankie

said he really liked Tennessee and
spent time watching the University
of Tennessee Volunteers football
team practice.

Frankie Gustine just happened
to be one of the youngest players

Some people get a little

screaming girls shown in

concerts in the 1960s.

ever to be called up to the majors
when the Pirates pulled him from
the minors in 1939 at the age of 19.
Although he spent most of the next
11 years playing second base, he
played all the infield positions and

even played catcher on several
occasions. His stint with the
Pirates saw him in three All-Star
Games in I946, ’47 and ’48.

I was upset when our luncheon
conversation turned from Fran-
kie's colorful career to public rela-
tions and advertising campaigns
for the restaurant. I wanted to hear
more about his years in the minors
and with the majors——from Pitts-
burgh, to Los Angeles, to St. Louis
and back to Pittsburgh as a coach. I
wanted to know how he became a
college basketball coach after being
a professional baseball player. I
had heard that he coached baseball
at Point Park College and took
them to the finals of the NAIA
tournament in I974. What was that
like? Did he know Babe Ruth? Lou
Gehrig? Ted Williams?

There was so much more that I
wanted to know from my host that
the old reporter instinct in me
nearly prevailed. I decided that all
that would have to wait until
another time, but I did manage to

corner the first Pitt News reporterl
saw after leaving the restaurant and
told him what a good subject Fran-
kie Gustine would make for a fea-
tures article. I'll have to leave all
the good questions to the reporter
and wait like everyone else to read
the copy on Frankie when the arti-
cle appears in the next week or so.

I met a United States vice presi-
dent once and got his autograph. I
chauffeured the group, The Out-
laws, last year when they appeared
for the Pitt Program Council. I
even played an extra in a movie
once with Don Rickles, Dr. ] and
Stockard Channing. I’ve met
dozens of celebrities. Some I’ve
liked, and some] wish I hadn't met.
Frankie Gustine is our own local
celebrity, and it was a pleasure
meeting him. I'm only sorry that it
took five years for me to do so.
Maybe next time I’ll ask for his
autograph.

Gina Miller

While few would argue that col-
lege is a learning experience, many
students graduate without ever hav-
ing experienced what Pitt has to
offer outside the classroom.

Student activities here include
everything from Student Govern-
ment Board to fraternities and so- '
rorities. Even though these organi-
zations are run by students, they are
not without administrative support.
Advisors from the office of Student
Activities help student organiza-
tions run smoothly and achieve their
goals.

Gina Miller, one of six assistant
directors of student activities, is in
charge of operating the Pitt Pro-
gram Council and advising students
who serve as chairpeople to the var-
ious committees.

“Ultimately I’m responsible for
what the program council does and
the professional nature of their pro-
grams,” she said.

Miller’s duties include meeting
with students to determine the time
lines of their programs, making sure

plans proceed according to sched-
ule, processing financial paper
work, sorting through promotional
material with students and planning

Although programs are discussed
with Miller or program coordinator
Jimmy Gilliland, they are ultimately
selected and run by students.

.would get too off track, I could veto
their decisions. But that’s only as a
last resort,” Miller said.

“By the time-a program is ready to
be planned, we ’ve already discussed

it thoroughly. My approval is
implied,” she added-.

Miller got into the field of student
activities by accident. “I never even
knew about student activities during
school,” she said.

“When I was an undergraduate,
my friends convinced me to run for
treasurer of student government.
The position required that I work

closely with the student activities‘

office so my day-to-day exposure
taught me what student activities
was about,” she continued.

After serving as director of stu-
dent activities at La Roche College
andthen working in the Dean of
Students office at Duquesne Uni-
versity, Miller obtained her present
position at Pitt. ~

Jimmy Gilliland, who shares the
duties of overseeing the Pitt Pro-
gram Council with Miller, became
involved in student activities while
he was in school at the College of
Steubenville. This is his first full—time
job in the field.

Gilliland supervises the opera-
tions at films and makes sure every-
thing is running smoothly. He also
advises the entertainment, concerts
and arts committees.

“Any time there’s a program I
make sure it’s running smoothly and

 

make sure plans go according to
schedule,” he said.

Mill’er.and Gilliland follow closely_
what the students are doing, but
most of the responsibility of what
happens falls on the students.

“They write their own policies.
For instance, they came up with the
X-rated films policy,” said Miller.
“They must have our approval, but
they come up with the policies
themselves.”

According to Miller, the greatest
reward of her job is “all of the
accomplishments. You can see your
progress because every completed
program is a stepping stone.

“Working with the students day-
to-day is also fulfilling,” she added.

Gilliland also finds his interaction
with students to be the best part of
his job. The worst part of it he says is
“getting to work at 9:00 am. after
being at a program until midnight.”

“The time you must spend here
curtails the time in your life for other
things,” said Miller.

One thing they both agree on is

(Pitt’s literary magazine), Panther
Prints, and the Freshman Record.

Advising all of these publications
would appear to keep Lunsford
busy, but he also manages to find
time to sit on the Student Publica-
tions and Media Board and help with
Pitt’s annual writer’s conference.

“The Pitt News takes up most of
my time because it’s the largest,”
Lunsford said. ‘‘I keep the books for
the paper and approve all the
expenditures.”

Lunsford said that much of his
day is spent dealing with people who
come to his office or call him. “Stu-
dents drop in to get something
signed, ask questions or just to say
hello,” he said.

After attending the University of
Tennessee as a communications
/journalism major, Lunsford-
worked for his fraternity’s national
magazine. It was this job that gave
him an opportunity to travel to dif-
ferent college campuses and
exposed him to the field of student
activities. “

I Larry Lunsford

that no two days are alike and that
their jobs are a lot of fun. “When
your job starts to be something you
don’t want to do, you have to get
out,” Miller said.

As to why students should get
involved in student activities, Gilli-
land said that “college is an expe-

rience most people only go through‘

once, so you should try to get the
most out of it you can. Getting
involved in student activities is a
learning experience, a way to gain
social interaction and a lot of fun.”

Miller‘ said that students should
get involved because of “the per-
sonal satisfaction, being able to
identify and feel like you belong to
the university. The skills you pick up
are life skills.” ,

“Getting involved allows you to
face challenges your academic life
.won’t offer you, but you have to be
looking for that challenge and expe-
rience,” she added.

Larry Lunsford, assistant director

campus media, oversees The Pitt

. News, ,WPGH radio, Backspace,

. Lunsford completed a graduate
program in student personnel at
Indiana before first becoming as-
sistant dean of students at Evans-
ville and then comingto Pitt.

He likes his job because of “the
interaction with students and the

feeling that I’m being of help in some
area, whether it be personal, aca-
demic or professional. That’s whyl
chose the business,” he said.

One of the frustrating aspects is
that sometimes things don’t go as
planned. “Sometimes things take
longer than they should,” he said.

‘‘I think extra and co-curricular
activities are just as important as the
classroom. They have as much to
do with student development as the
academic side does,” said Lunsford.

He added that “if you can’t com-
municate and get along with people,
then you’re not going to succeed. It
can even be beneficial in getting a

Lately it seems as if the student
union is a mess with all the construc-
tion going on, but there is someone

behind the scenes running the.

show.

Chris Chergi, assistant director of
student activities in charge of build-
ing management, sees that the stu-
dent union operates smoothly.

‘‘I’m generally responsible for
management of the student union. I
supervise the reservations office,
the ticket office, the information
desk, the house managers, special
set up crews, and manage the stu-
dent season football program,” she
said.

The renovations going on don’t
make Chergi’s job any easier. ‘‘I
coordinated all of the temporary
moves and the placing of phones,
met with department heads, am
responsible for developing the appli-
cations for space and leasing and
also for coordinating the moves
back upstairs,” she said.

Like the other assistant directors
of student activities, Chergi has a lot
of interaction with students. “My
day-to-day activities include advis-
ing students of policies and proce-
dures and working with the Pitt
Program Council in setting up for
programs,” Chergi said.

, Chergi started her career at Pitt
as a typist for student publications.
When a position for administrative
aide opened, Chergi took the job
and gradually worked her way up to
her present position.

Giangarlo got into the field of stu-

said.

According to Giangarlo, the most
rewarding part of her job is “the
energy level that gets returned to
me in -working with students. lt’s the
enthusiasm that’s infectious. When
you see people develop over four
years, it's really satisfying.”

“When you hear from someone

“We want students to change and

Advising fraternities, sororities
and the Graduate and Professional
Student Association keeps assistant
director of student activities Lou
McLinden quite busy.

McLinden’s duties include “meet-
ing with students, going over pro-
grams, making suggestions, making
sure they abide by the constitution
and bylaws, helping them plan any
events and helping in getting out all
necessary printing,” he said.

Originally in the hotel and con-
vention field in Pittsburgh, Washing-
ton, D.C. and Harrisburg,
McLinden first came to Pitt as direc-
tor of Off-Campus Housing before
assuming his present position.

McLinden said he enjoys “seeing
students stop back after they gradu-
ate and being successful in their
fields, and also the development and
maturity they have arrived at during
four years of college.”

He said getting involved in stu-
dents activities involves “a great
deal of learning——learning to get
along with your,fellow man. You get
to deal with different age groups. It’s
a good healthy climate to be able to
deal with older people because
that’s what you do later.”

Learning is a two way experience,
however. “lt’s amazing how much
you hear from students talking,”
McLinden said."

Coordinator _ of Off-Campus
Housing Mary Lou Sosso said her
office sees about 15,000 students
annually.

“The” office is a listing service. We
provide information to students by
way of a card system, answer ques-
tions, speak at orientations through-
out the year and handle the

emergency loan program, where
students can get loans of $100 or
less,” she said.

Services are free to Pitt students,

 

* Terry. Milani «. » 

but realtors must pay a listing fee.
Even though her staff has the
most contact with students, Sosso
said she enjoys working with stu-
dents and with people in general.
One thing she doesn’t like is.that
the office is not allowed to give stu-
dents information about the places
they’re renting.
"We have a student comment sect
ion, but we can’t say things because
we’re liable since our information is
second hand,” she said.
In addition to the student com-

- ment section, there are sections for

people looking for roommates
either with or without an apartment.

Sosso’s advice to students is to
“look early. If you’re interested in
renting in September, look in
March. Also, students should take

inventory of what’s wrong with the ,

apartment and have the landlord
sign it so they can get their security
deposits back.”,

According to Sosso, “another sad
part is foreign or new students’ lack
of understanding of renting.” On
this note, she warned against sign-
ing two leases.

the Office of Student Activities.

North Carolina Ready To Test Pitt’s Top Ranking

By JOE ZEFF

When some sports fans think of

Chapel Hill, N.C., images of a
high—flying Tar Heel stuffing a
basketball through the dangling
mesh are evoked, but many of the
Pitt football players envision a
whole different ballgame when
North Carolina is brought up.

“North Carolina is the season."
Panther offensive guard Ron Sams
said of tomorrow night's gridiron
encounter at Three Rivers Sta-
dium. “I don't even know who we
play after that."

Should Pitt fall to North Carol-
ina, it might not matter who they
play after that. Pitt’s shot at the
mythical national championship
would be just that. Mythical.

Coach Foge Fazio must out-duel
North Carolina's Dick Crum to
retain his niche in the McArthur
Bowl sweepstakes. Crum’s resume
boasts a 34-12-1 four-year record,
including last year’s l0-2 cam-
paign and 31-13 to South Carolina
and 10-8 to Clemson—occurred
when Crum’s sensational tailback
and quarterback were ailing.

If not for a few injuries—nine
starters missed games——-a season
ago, the Tar Heels might have
made an even better impression
than their No. 8 final ranking.

More than 1,000 rushing yards
and 108 points are excellent statis-
tics for a collegiate running back,
exceptional for a junior tailback.
But when a player battles an injury
to achieve those marks in only 22 of
his team's 44 quarters, those
numbers become phenomenal.

Meet Kelvin Bryant, the key to
North Carolina's pursuit of its first

Kraynak Looks To Botle Carolina Attack

By BRIAN BALK

Senior Panther linebacker Rich
Kraynak has an aptitude for break-
ing football into simple terms:
“The game of football is broken
into thirds: offense, defense and
kicking. If you win two of those
three, you can win the game.
Simple.”

It may appear simple on paper,
but on the playing field, it is much
more complex. Simplicity and
complexity are the paradoxes of
football, and Kraynak’s goal is to
overcome the complexity and win.

Kraynak will test his theory for
the first time this season tomorrow
night when the Panthers meet
North Carolina. Pitt’s defensive
strategy is set, aimed at stopping
the powerful Tar Heel running
attack. ‘ '

“What we Want to do is to build a
fence around the NC offense,”
Kraynak explained. The defensive
objective is to create an impenetra-
ble wall so that the running back

Kelvin Bryant (right) follows the block of All-America guard Dave Drechsler.

national championship and Heis-
man Trophy. Bryant suffered torn
cartilage in his left knee during the
fourth game of the 1981 season, but
already had 520 yards and 15 touch-
downs under his belt.

He stormed back into the lineup
two games later to amass 418 yards

will be forced outside,” Kraynak
said.

Pitt’s task will be to counter the
deceptive swiftness of the Tar
Heels’ Kelvin Bryant; Kraynak has
previously tangled with opposi-
tion_just as fierce—All-America
Herschel Walker.

“I’ve got to read the right keys in
order to get a quick jump on the
play,” Kraynak said. “I have to
watch how the quarterback flows. ~
He gives little clues on which way
the play is going to go,” Kraynak
said.

Kraynak, 6-1, 221 lbs., is well
versed in the duties of a linebacker.
His statistics from last year alone
display his mastery—l04 tackles
(63 of which were solo take-
downs). The Panther defensive
unit, rated No. 1 in the nation dur-
ing thepast two years, sustained

the notable losses of Sal Sunseri, .

Pappy Thomas and Foge Fazio
during the off-season. Fazio, pro-
moted from defensive coordinator
to head coach, no longer can con-
continued on page sixteen

in Carolina's last two games and
148 more in the Gator Bowl. His
6-2, 195 lb. frame will definitely
have a bullseye painted all over it
by the Pitt defense tomorrow night.

Sophomore Ethan Horton was
moved from QB to TB late last sea-

son to replace the injured Bryant.
Horton rushed for 144 yards and
two touchdowns in the Gator
Bowl. Either he or fullback James
Jones will join Bryant in the Tar
Heel backfield.

Another of Crum’s 15 returning
starters—eight on offense, seven/on

defense—will be plotted behind the

center. Quarterback Rod Elkins,
hampered by a sprained ankle a
year ago, proved just'as effective on
the ground as in the skies. Elkins is
an asset to Carolina's run—oriented
offense, and a winner, as docu-
mented by his 20-2 record as a start-
ing passer in high school and
college.

One of the seven Parade High
School All-Americas North Carol-
ina signed this year—Pitt nabbed
four—should bolster Crum’s
receiving corps. Tight end Arnold
Franklin, a freshman from Cincin-
nati, could start by mid-season.

The Tar Heels’ turbo-charged
offense hummed to the tune of 31.3
points and 415.7 yards per game
last season. With Bryant at the
steering wheel, an excellent offen-
sive line cleared paths for its
tailback.

All-Conference guards David
Dreschler (A1l—America) and Ron
Spruills and tackle Brian Blados
will assure Bryant of his share of
magazine cover stories this fall.

The Carolina offense often over-
shadows its defensive counterpart,
but Fazio hasn’t overlooked the
defense after surveying miles of
game film. Defensive tackle Wi_l-
liam fuller played a leading role in
those films. ’

Fuller, an All-Conference line-
man,‘ tied Lawrence Taylor's
school record of 22 tackles behind
the line of scrimmage last season.
He anchors a tenacious 5-2 defense
that was the fifth stingiest in Amer-
ica, allowing 11.2 points per game
in '81.

Panther linebacker Rich Kraynak aims to fence in the North Carolina running attack.”

North Carolina is perhaps the best

matchup in college football this
season. The Panthers have been
chosen by virtually everyone from
Playboy magazine to the UPI and
AP pre—season polls as the most
likely candidates to win the
national championship. The Tar
Heels are the fifth choice.

On offense, Pitt has an All-

a tailback who rushed for over

1,000 yards last season, Bryan Tho-
mas; an offensive line, let by All-
America tackle Jimbo Covert, big
and strong enough to allow

The Tar Heels carry some
impressive credentials, also. Offen-

scrambling from the pocket and

Despite the apparently even mat-

Pitt’s receivers are too quick for the

offensive line can clear out North
Carolina's defensive line, not
necessarily with its strength, but
with its quickness.

A Telephone Call From A North Carolina Fan

By MAX REGULA

“You've got a phone call, Max,”
my roommate said.

“Who is she?” I said.

“She’s a he,” he said, putting
down the phone. “It’s Billy
Dymond from North Carolina.”

“Tell him I’m busy,” I said.

“I already put the phone down.”

“Then tell him I’m at the library,
studying,” I said.

“He knows yo_u’re not at the
library, He was your best friend in
high school.”

“Then tell him I went for a walk,
anything,” I said.

“Nope.”

"He’s just calling to brag,” I
said.

“So.”
“So! I’ll have to listen to him tell

me how nice the weather is.”

“It’s not that bad here.”

“He’ll tell me how beautiful all
the ‘southern’ girls are.”

“That’s one for him.”

“And he'll tell me how great the
football team is.”

“But we'll find that out on
Thursday, won't we?”

Yes, I thought.

“Hello, Billy,” I said.

“Don’t give me excuses!” He-

shouted. “Who you got, anyhow?”
“A couple guys,” I said.

“Who?” He demanded.
“Marina and Thomas.”

“Only two guys," he scoffed.
“Marino, Thomas, Fralic and

Covert."
“Four guys, so," he said.

“Marino, Thomas, Fralic,
Covert, Maas and Lewis.”

“Mmm, six guys.”

“Marino, Thomas, Fralic,

Covert, Maas Lewis, McIntyre and
Collins.”

“Eight guys."

“Marino, Thomas Fralic,
Covert, Maas, Lewis, McIntyre,
Collins, Flynn, Pelusi,...”

The line went dead.

sider only defense, but Kraynak
said the “loss” of Fazio has not
affected the defense. “Foge is still
there," he said. “Although he is
head coach overseeing everyone, he
is still around calling the plays and
making the adjustments in the
defense,” Kraynak said.

Kraynak, who practiced with
such Pantherdefensive greats as
Hugh Greene and Ricky Jackson,
said this year’s squad may be Pitt’s
best ever. “We are bigger, stronger
and quicker than last year. Eve-
ryone has improved,” Kraynak
said.

“Having at least one year under

our belts, everyone feels more
secure than last year,” Kraynak
said.

But Kraynak labels one aspect as
more crucial than maturity——
coaching. “Our coaching has a
great impact on our success,” he
said. “I guess you could call our
good coaching the mainstay of our
team. If it weren’t for ()ur great
coaching, I wouldn’t know how to
play defense.

“Football is a learning process,”
Kraynak said. “Everyday I learn
new things from other players and
from practice.”

Kraynak said he agrees with the
experts who placed Pitt atop the

major polls, but his optimism is
clouded by a trace of uncertainty.

“Every step on the ladder is a
major obstacle all the way up to the

Fazio said, ‘When you’re king of

ﬁsome Predictions For The First Week Of.NFL

The Cowboys alwaY5 Seem [0
come up with a good effort on
Monday night football. The differ-
ence will be the kicking game. Dal-
las has Rafael Septien, perhaps the
most consistent place kicker in
football; the Steelers waived former
Panther kicker Dave trout yester-
day and are still searching for a
kicker who can get the job done.

Houston over Cincinnati, 24-10.

The Oilers may be on the
decline, but they still have Earl
Campbell. He’ll run over the
Bengals.

Cleveland over Seattle, 35-34

I could have picked Seattle just
as easily, but I like Sam Rutigliano
better than Jack Patera. Jim Zorn,
if you only had a defense...

Philadelphia over Washington,
l3-10. ‘

The Redskins have some good
young talent and would have a
chance to pull of the upset if the
game were in Washington instead
of in Philadelphia

Detroit over Chicago, 9-7.

Another one of those NFC Cen-
tral Division defensive struggles.
The Lions can make the big plays
on defense late in the game.

/ N.Y. Jets over Miami, 24-7.
The Jets more than make up for
their lack of defense with a strong
running and passing game.

San Diego over Denver, 31-17.

The Chargers have too much
offense with Dan Fouts at
quaterback.

Once Again Computerized Cowboys Win In East

By scorr DELLETT

The leaves are still green, the
humidity is still in the air and the
summer tans have not yet faded
away, but the National Football
League is ready to start its 62nd
season. Of course there are the
usual questions—can the Cowboys
remain “America’s Team,” will
the Steelers regain the form that
won them four Super Bowls and

‘age V can the Saints get out of the purga-

H‘,

»..e:

v ,

tory of last place—but there remain
more unanswered inquiries. Will
the players strike, and if they do,
when? Will the Raiders remain in
Los Angeles, or will they move to
Moscow? A

While this writer can't answer
the last two questions, he will try to
remove the clouds from his crystal
ball and find out who will be the
dominating force in the era of par-
ity in the NFC.

NFC East

1. Dallas: Ho, Hum, picked first
again. While the team America des-
ises more than J.R. Ewing are
sure bets to make the playoffs for
the 16th year out of the last 17. How
can the squad keep up with such
success?

With players just coming into
their prime, such as quarterback
Danny White and running back
Tony Dorsett, with lineman such
as Randy White, with free agent
finds such as Everson Walls.

Simply put: with an efficient,

steady, well-run organization led
by Tex Schramm and head coach
Tom Landry.

However, the computer that the
front office uses doesn’t do well in
playoff competition. Count on the
flowboys to take the division, but
then find a way to miss the, Super
Bowl.

2. Philadelphia: Vermeil’s
Heroes were flying high after 12
games. Some were already making
their reservations for Detroit, home
of the last Super Bowl. Then the
offense went to sleep, scoring only
three points in the second half of
the last four games. What
happened? ,

Dick Vermeil is trying out ne
receivers like Mike Quick, Vito
Kab, and Lawrence Sampleton for
their compatability with quarter-
back Ron Jaworski. Offensive
wizard Sid Gilliam has also

, returned to help out Jaworski.

All other areas of the team are
alright, but in the era of parity, a
team must be able to pass in order
to win.

3. Washington: Despite a 0-5
start, the Redskins came on to post
a  record during the latter part of
the campaign. The main reason for
the turnaround was the acquisition
of running back Joe Washington
from Baltimore, who gained 916
yards rushing and caught 70 passes
for 558 yards.

Quarterback Joe Theisman
returns along with a four receiver
offense—a creation of head coach
Joe Gibbs, a former coach at San
Diego.

Although the Redskins are still
feeling the effect ()f George Allen's
“Over the Hill Gang," the Reds-
‘kins can still challenge for a wild
card spot in the playoffs.

4. New York Giants: So what if?

they made the playoffs last year?
Remember, the Giants were in last
place the year before, which means
that the schedule was of a cake var-
iety. Tampa Bay won the NFC
Central division after finishing in
last the year before and ended the
next year in fourth place.

Nevertheless, the Giants will
field a competitive team. The
defense is tough, with linebackers

.awrence Taylor, Brad Van Pelt
and cornerback Mark Ilaynes the
outstanding performers.

The Giants need to find an
offense. Scott Brunner is now the
number one quarterback, as Phil
Simms is out for the year with a
knee injury. With Rob Carpenter
out as a contract holdout, draft

choice Butch Woolfolk must
supply most of the ground attack.
New York will field a co‘mpeti-
tive squad, but making the playoffs
seems unlikely at this point.

5. St. Louis: It may be a while
before the Cardinals take off soar-
ing in flight. Quarterback Neil
Lomax will continue to experience
growing pains as a young NFL
quarterback while Otis Anderson
will show a few flashy moves in the
backfield.

The defense? The less said, the
better.

In -an other division, such as the
NFC Central, the Cardinals may be
contending for the division title. In
the most difficult division in foot-
ball. St. Louis will remain in the
cellar. I

NFC Central

1. Chicago: Say what? They fin-
ished‘in last place in 1982. There’s
no way a last-place team can come
back the next year and finish first.
Except when you’re in the NFC

Central. where 20 other teams
would make the playoffs if they
were playing in the pink and tur-
quoise division.

One plus in the Bears’ favor is
the new coach, Mike Ditka. He is
not used to losing and he won’t
take much of it. Another plus 28 the
defense, where several talented per-
formers return, including safeties
Gary Fengcik and Doug Plank,
linebacker Mike Singletary and
right end Al Harris.

Walter Payton will ‘be involved
in a more complex offense that may
add several years to his career. Wide
receiver James Scott returns from
the Canadian Football League to
shore up the position.

Quarterback will be either Vince
Evans or rookie Jim McMahon.

The Bears may not be as good as
half the teams in the NFL, but
mediocre always takes the NFC
Central.

2. Detroit: The Lions would
have taken the title if Billy Sims
would have reported to camp.
Now, the Lion must find some-

Hipple is a decent quarterback, but
his effectiveness is lowered without
Sims in the backfield.

The defensive line is one of the
best in professional football, led by
Bubba Baker and Doug English.

If Sims returns within the next
week or so, the Lions will be con-
tenders. If he stays out longer than
that, write off the Lions. ~

3. Tampa'Bay: If Doug Williams
keeps maturing, the Buccaneers
will have a chance to retain the div-
ision title. The defense will be good
with defensive end Lee Roy Sel-
mon and Linebacker Hugh Green.

First round draft choice Sean
Farrell will shore up a weak line
and Booker Reese will help out Sel-
mon on the defensive trenches.

The schedule will not be as sim-
ple as in 1981; therefore, Tampa
Bay will struggle to keep the paper
title of the Central division.

4. Minnesota: Two things are
certain with the 1982 Minnesota
Vikings—they will be playing in
the Hubert H. Humphrey Metro-

Kramer will throw a lot of passes to
running backs Darrin Nelson,
Tony Galbreath and Rickey
Young.

The defense is not like the ones
of the past, with newly-acquired
Charlie Johnson playing defensive
tackle the only outstanding talent. '

If the offense scores enough
points to overcome the defense, the
Vikings will be able to contend for
the division title. But don’t wait in
the Minnesota snowstorm in
December to find out.

5. Green Bay: /Even though the
Packers have some of the potent
receivers in the league in James
Lofton and John Jefferson, Bart
Starr has to find a quarterback to
get the ball to them. If he doesn’t,
bye-bye Bart.

NFC West

1. San Francisco: This writer still
doesn’t believe the Forty-Niners are
for real, but their talent outclasses
everyone else in the West.

1. New York Jets: The Jets came
so close to upending the Buffalo
Bills in the AFC playoffs last year,
throwing an interception with

‘seconds leftto play and driving for

the game winning score.

The strength of this team is in its
pass rush. Mark Gastineau, Abdul
Salaam, Marty Lyons and Joe
Klecko combined for 66 sacks last
year, tops in the NFL last season.

Richard Todd is coming off of
his best season of his career and the
offensive line protected him well
for once. Johnny “Lam” Jones and
Wesley Walker are two top-rated
receivers to whom Todd can throw.

Despite a poor start, the Jets ral-
lied to make the playoffs. If they
can get off the starting blocks fast,
watch out AFC.

2. Buffalo Bills: It is said that
money is the root of all evils, and
the Bills are having problems with
paying their star players the big
bucks.

Joe Cribbs has held out of camp
and is asking for a renegotiation of
his contract, which provides prob-
lems for the offense. Quarterback
Joe Ferguson is still around, but
without Cril)bs the offense is not
the same.

It will be on the hands of the
defense to keep the Bills
competitive.

 Miami: Young is the way to
describe the Dolphins. Over four
years, 27 new players have stayed
on the Miami roster.‘

David Woodley and Don Strock

will support each other at the quar— _

terback spot. Woodley will be the
starter and Strock will be the long
relief man.

Players who should catch the eye
of Dolphin fans are linebackers
Charles Bowser and Ron Hester
and guard Roy Foster.

' Normally, this would be a
rebuilding year in Miami. With
head coach Don Shula, the Dol-
phins are legitimate contenders.

4. New England: Finally, the
Patriots have named a starting

quarterback, former Pitt star Matti

Cavanaugh. This is a good start for
the Pats’ attempt to return to con-
tender status. Several rookies are
pushing for starting spots, includ-
ing No. 1 draft choices Kenneth
Sims and Lester Williams.

New England still has a long
way to go.

5. Baltimore: The only predic-
tion for Sergeant Frank Kush is
that the Colts will contend with the
Saints for the worst team in the
NFL in 1982,”

AFC Central

1. Cincinnati: As long as the
Bengals have Ken Anderson and
the striped helmets, they are going
to be tough.

Chris Collinsworth proved to be
one of the best receivers in the NFL
last season while Issac Curtis
remains a deep threat. Dan Ross is
also an outstanding tight end.

The defense is a little suspect,
and head coach Forrest Gregg
drafted two linemen, Glen Collins
and Emanuel Weaver to help out.

The race will be tighter this year,
but the Bengals should edge
through.

2. Pittsburgh: Plenty of question
marks here. Can the defense remain
effective with the switch to the 3-4?
Can the defensive backfield find a
way to cover receivers?

Terry Bradshaw returns to throw
his bombs to John Stallworth and
Lynn Swann. Franco Harris is also
ready to put his body through
another rigorous season.

The defense is aging, with Jack
Ham, Jack Lambert, Mel*Blount
and Donnie Shell all in their 305.

Still, if Bradshaw hadn’t broken
his wrist playing Oakland, the
Steelers would have made the
playoffs. They will be in the hunt
again this year.

 Cleveland: The Browns took a

beating in 1981, but they are bank-
ing on Tom Cousinwau and Chip
Banks to help out the always por-
ous defense.

Brian Sipe will have to recover
from -an off year and lead the
Browns’ offense again. -

Too many changes to consider
Clevland a contender in the Cen-
tral division. _

4. Houston: Earl Campbell is
feeling the pains of getting hit a
thousand times every season. Gif-
ford Nielson is inexperienced. The
defense is not like it use to be.

A long season for Ed Biles’
Oilers.

' AFC West

1. San Diego: Air Coryell flies
again. Dan Fouts continues to pass
40 times a game to receivers like
Kellen Winslow, Wes Chandler
and Charlie Joiner. Ricky Bell and
Chuck Muncie should help out the
running attack.

Trades for safety Tim Fox, Bruce
Laird and linebacker Dewey Sel-
mon and David Lewis should help
out the defense.

The Chargers should be a factor
in the playoffs again this year.

2. Denver: Craig Morton can still
throw the ball despite being near 40
years old. Running back Gerald
Willhite can run the ball. But the

 Cincy To Win Central; Steelers A Close Second

Broncos will only get as far as their
defense.

Louis Wright, Tommy Jackson,
Randy Gradishar and Bob Swen-
son are survivors of the famed
“Orange Crush” defense.

The Broncos have one more
chance to make the playoffs with
Morton at the helm.

3. Kansas City: Joe Delaney is
one of the league's better backs in a
mold of Joe Cribbs. If his is reco-
vered from an eye injury and the
Chiefs don‘t overuse him, he will
be one effective offense weapon.

The quarterbacking situation is
split between Steve Fuller and Bill
Kenny.

The defense has several talented
performers such as Gary Green,
Eric Harris, Gary Barbaro, Art Still
and Mike Bell.

The Chiefs are still a ways off
from the playoffs.

4. Raiders: No matter where they
are, the Raiders are not the team
they once were. Jim Plunkett
returns as starting quarterback, but
a year like 1980 is not likely. The
Raiders are also depending on vete-
rans pick up such as Cedric Hart-
man, Lyle Alzado and Greg Pruitt.

The formula worked in Super
Bowl XV, but not this year.

5. Seattle: The Seahawks will be
exciting as always, but they will
again finish last.
