Tax Bill Dominates Meetings

By SUE McFARLAN D
Pitt News Staff Writer ,
Student Government Board
president Bernie Payne traveled to

Harrisburg last weekend for talks-

aimed at gaining further insight
into the failure of the State House
to pass a bill that would provide

some $300 million for Pennsyl-=
vania’s four state-related universi- '

ties. — .

Payne said the meeting, which
included state government aides
and members of the House
Conference Committee, centered

.on future strategy by Pitt, Penn

State, Temple and Lincoln universi-
ties to urge passage of a tax
increase that would pave the way
for university funding.

Payne said he believed “political
reasons” will preclude ﬁrst-vote
passage of a tax hike that would
raise personal and business taxes
to 2.5 percent and 10 percent.

“These legislators see their
political futures in front of- them,”
Payne said. “Elections in the state

SGB: Leaders or Followers?

‘A By LISA RUBENSTEIN
Pitt News Staff Writer
Students complain about student
government, if they think about-it
at all. They see problems. It is not
just students, though; members of
this year’s Student _Government

Board also face questions regard-

-g their own effectiveness.
Seven SGB 2-.
members in-
terviewed last
week defined ff.‘-
themselves as 
effective in 15I--'-‘

some ways, and as ineffective in if
‘others.

The definitions of

"elffectiveness for a student govern-

   

ment ranged widely, but, most
members narrowed an effective
student government to one that

“does what students want.”

 

“In order to be an effective
student government, there has to
be commitment on a number of
different levels. It means
commitment to students to do the
best job possible,” said SGB
president Bernie Payne.

“Service is the way to go with
student government,” SGB mem-
ber Dave Hesidence said. “‘We
have to ‘ﬁnd out what students
want. We have to ﬁnd out what
their needs are.”

SGB member Josph Baylson said
student government should coordi-
nate student services. ' '

Newly appointed member Dave
Garger said, “You should do what
students tell you they want.”

All of the deﬁnitions have one
thing-in common. They express the
view that students should approach

. Center

SGB with their problems. This

I deﬁnition casts students in the role

of leaders, and the student
government board members as
followers. In this view, student
government becomes reactive,
rather than active and initiative. I

Instead of electing leaders to the
board, this view means electing a
group of followers.

In many areas, this year’s board
has waited, and has maintained the
status quo. Instead of improving
upon and changing things, in many

‘ways it merely has relied on

initiatives of past boards.

are only about 10 months away and
when they go home to their
constituents in the next few weeks
they want to be able to tell them
they voted against tax increases
again and again.” For this reason,
Payne believes the bill may be
voted down four or ﬁve times
before it is passed.

Payne expressed hope Pitt
students will show further interest
in seekingstate funding.

“We"have discussed the possi-
bility of another rally such as the
one staged at the Capitol Nov. 15,
and the collective meeting of
concerned citizens, parents, stu-
dents and professionals from the
business world, in the very near
future,” Payne said. , ,

“Now, when students and
parents will be together at home for
the holidays, things should hap-

pen. They should be writing letters ,

and getting in touch with the
appropriate people,” Payne said.

Students at Penn State, Temple
and Lincoln have constructed a

number of black students at Pitt and
the “bogus afﬁrmativeaction” plan
employed by the University. '
Porter suggested the chairman-
ship be replaced by a coalition of

black teachers and students elected

by the department and under “the
good advice and supportive inform-
ed persons of the community.”

Porter said he will remain‘ as a
faculty member in the department
and still will offer input on
departmental decisions, should it
be headed by a coalition.

Rosenberg indicated a temporary
coalition may be. acceptable until
one person can be found to ﬁll the
vacancy as chairman.

The Dean said department
conﬂict would be created if more
than one person ran the black
studies department, and maintain-
ed that a single person must assume
responsibilities such as payrolls,
appointments and ﬁlling teaching
positions.

Porter disagreed, claiming the
department was founded .by the
students and should be managed
by the students.

Rosenberg could not say how long
the department chair would remain
vacant. ‘

Seven Votes
Defeat Taxes

_, HARRISBURG (AP) - The
House pulled within seven
votes of passing an increase in .
the personal and business
income taxes Tuesday. \

The measure failed 95-102,
but Democrats gained more
Republican support for the tax
hike, which would fund state-
aided universities.

“Unless some members can’t
get here or if they’re sick, I
think we’ll have it by tomorrow
(Wednesday),” said Demo-
cratic leader James Manderino.

“There were three commit-
ments on our side for higher

don’t know why, but I’m going
to talk to them and ﬁnd out, ” he
said in an interview. Mander-
ino said he also had expected
more Republican. support.

The proposal would increase
the 2 percent personal income
tax to 2.2 percent, costing the
average tax payer between 40
and 80 cents more a week. It
also would increase. the 9.5
percent business‘ tax to 10.5
percent. Both taxes would
expire in two years.

After the taxes were rejected,
the House immediately decided

to reconsider the bill on
V Wednesday. I
Although Manderino and

other Democrats were optimis-
tic about - passing the taxes
eventually, it still may be rough
going.

Rep. Harrison Haskell, R-
Crawford, one of ﬁve Republi-
cans to vote for the tax hike,
saidhe wouldn’t vote again for
the tax package. 7

He said his tax vote was a
one-time thing to show that he

r was capable of compromise.

‘ ‘I rise today not in support of
the tax program, but in despair,
anger and frustration at the
petulant, little-boy antics dem-
onstrated by the leadership on
both sides of the aisle...”
Haskell told the House.

The list is long, but, in exam-
ining it, one finds that many items
are merely implementation of past
boards’ programs. Few are truly
imaginative approaches to solving
student problems. This is not to
say implementation of programs is
not an important SGB function, as
board members are quick to point
out, it says student government
has taken little ‘initiative toward
alleviating the daily problems of a
student’s existence.

Board members claim the
structure of student government is
partly at fault. Payne would like to

see a strong executive shape policy .

“so you don’t have to worry about
somebody jumping off.” ~

Dave Hesidence explained it this
way: “Seven students come in
with seven different ideologies.
They each have different projects
they are interested in.”

Despite problems inherent in the
government structure, seven is a
workable number for a group of
students who want to initiate
change. Having an effective
student government depends on its
leaclership—it is a matter of
electing leaders rather than follow-
ers.

DRAWS CAUTION

PITTSBURGH (AP)—Amid
signs of dissent, steel producers
Tuesday reacted cautiously to a
Carter administration program
to help their troubled industry
make more money.

“We have several reserva-
tions concerning the program, ”
said U.S. Steel President David
M. Roderick.

The President’s task force ,
estimated its plan would boost
domestic steel earnings by $900
million, while trimming imports
by about six million tons.

“On paper it looks good, but
will it work?” asked a steel
company spokesman.

Many producers would not
comment, saying they preferr-
ed to review the report more
fully before reacting.

Others praised President
Carter’s concern for the indus-
try, but stopped short of
unqualiﬁed endorsement.

“Taken altogether, the plan
is very welcome conﬁrmation
that the administration is '
dedicated to a program of
effective assistance to the steel
industry,” said National Steel
Chairman George A. Stinson.

By PETER J. BUTCH

Rich Dolson was elected Inter-
Fraternity Council president last
night, taking 64 percent of the vote
on the first ballot.

Dolson, a member of Delta
Sigma Phi,-defeated Joe Heim of
Delta Tau Delta, Tom Spagnol of
Sigma Chi and Steve Rossetti of Phi

18, 4, 3, and 3 votes, respectively.

A junior majoring in mechanical
engineering, Dolson campaigned
on a platform promising responsi-
bility to individual Greeks and the
system itself.

He promised increased pro.-
gramming for ’ fraternity members
besides the current mixers and
happy hours. He pledged an
increase in public relations efforts
on the part of the council.

Dolson stressed a desire to
strengthen IFC’s internal organi-

zation, with more input from the .

accountability to individual chap-
ters. I

Business is growing, according to
Mance. “We’re noticing an in-
crease in ‘prescriptions right now,”
he said. “Of course, we don’t have
the room to have every drug—but
we will take orders and have the

College of Arts and Sciences Dean Robert Marshall’s recent

anything approaching rigid compliance to the rules in this case, but
we think it is worthwhile to examine the reasons why he might

request it.

“There should be a lot of learning going on during that last week
of classes,” Dean Marshall said recently, and he’s right. Those
students—however few they may be—who actually care more
about learning than about merely escaping with three credits as
quickly as possible are cheated when the term ends a class or two

Moreover, many students are put at a great disadvantage by
having to cope with up to three and four finals during this last
week. Papers and other projects are often due at this time, and
students dashing off ten-page papers on Hobbesian. psychology
while studying for a final in psychoanalysis are likely to lose it all.

Often, students are asked by vacation-minded professors to vote
on whether they wouldn’t like to have an early final. The majority
usually rules in these cases—and it will continue to rule as long as

students know that, if they’re in the minority and protest too loudly

(i.e., to the Dean), they will be extremely unpopular with their
peers, not to mention the professor——but majority vote is not really
sufficient to establish the justice of the cause. We see no reason
why, in the case of unanimous approval, finals might not be ad-
ministered early, but a lone dissenter could rightly claim tyranny of
the majority if forced by classmates into -an exam this week.

Letters To The Editor

English Competency Standards Called Racist

In response to your front page
story on the Student Government
“poll” about the matter of Faculty
English competency, I should like to
say that your handling of the subject
was deplorable. The title of the
article asserted a falsehood: the

Black Studies Faculty Questioned

I am puzzled about one aspect of
the black studies faculty’s cam-
paign against Dean Rosenberg;
namely, that they have been
curiously reluctant to advertise the
qualiﬁcations and publications of
those allegedly discriminated a-
gainst.

Obviously, they must be as good
as or better than those of the
faculty in other departments who
have been denied tenure, some of
whom had doctorates and had
published in scholarly journals.
Otherwise, it is hard to understand
why they are victims of racial
discrimination.

If they . are, then it is only
necessary to give us the facts about
their degrees and their contribu-
tions to scholarship, and we’ll all
join in the chorus of condemnation.
If, on the other hand, Curtiss
Porter thinks that faculty in black
studies should be assessed by
standards other than those applied
to friends of mine whohave been
denied tenure in other depart-
ments, why doesn’t he have the
honesty to say so, and tell us what
they are?

I, and many others, are very
curious about this strange modes-
ty,.which has led some malicious

persons to suggest that the black
studies department has become so
used to getting its own way by
making dreadful noises and terrible
threats that they have lost all
tactical sense. What an appalling
slander! —

Would’ Porter also tell us how
many white faculty members there
are in his department, and relieve
all us white liberals of ‘ another
racist lie, to the effect that the
black studies department practices
reverse discrimination?

Please, Curtiss, tell us it’s not
true.

Martin Stanil and

“poll” was admitted by Student
Government to be useless, rep-
resenting. no fair sampling of the
student body, and done without
safeguards against bias.

Moreover, despite Mr. Garger’s
initial statement that, in his
opinion, the “poll” demonstrated
the need for a standard of English

competency for faculty, he admitted g

that the “poll” is unreliable. That
this indefensible “poll” should
appear as a front page story in The
Pitt News, in place of legitimate
reports on real‘ problems facing the
University, is outrageous.

Citing the “poll” in your
editorial ﬂies in the face of every
standard that can be applied. Using
41 responses in an undisclosed
sample, taken from a field of
approximately 25,000 students, as
evidence of the need for action, is
only evidence that you are juggling
ﬁgures.

At bottom, your idea of a
standard of English competency is

P Ebeneezer Scrooge as 0 Childhood

By R. DAVID TIME

I suppose we all had our
childhood idols. I know that I, as a
boy growing up in the 19S0’s, had a
lot of them. It really couldn't be
helped. Young people naturally
tend to view things as being all
good or all bad. The prevailing
national climate in the 50’s added
to that; throughout the country,
everything either was all good or all
bad. There were no shades of gray.

Out of the array of “all good”
characters, I picked several who
most closely ﬁt my own self-image

.at that time. My pantheon of

childhood idols included ﬁgures
such as the Long Ranger andthe
Cisco Kid. They were the outsiders
who, through their deeds, earned

'the respect and admiration of

others. There were Stan Musial
and Ted Williams. They were the
strong, silent types, who got the
job done and inspired conﬁdence.
There was Adlai Stevenson. He
was wise beyond all knowing, yet
enough of an iconoclast to take on a
national institution like Dwight
Eisenhower.

These are all typical childhood
idols, with the exception of

Stevenson, who, never achieved

the same level of national
acceptance as did the others. Even
so, he was a popular ﬁgure. There
was, however, one idol who was
mine and mine alone.. I feel
perfectly safe in saying that none of
my friends felt he was a person to
look up to. He. was Ebenezer
Scrooge.

I’m talking about Scrooge before
he had the visitations from those
three ghosts, , turned into a
simpering pussycat, and gave
turkeys to little kids who sang
“Tiptoe Through_ the Tulips.” I’m
talking about the Scrooge who
made that spineless jellyﬁsh of a
Bob Cratchit work on Christmas
because there was nothing in
Cratchit's Teamsters contract that
said he did not have to. I'm talking

-abo_ut:th_e~. Scrooge who not only did. .

not love Christmas, he hated it.

I've always felt that,Scr,ooge was

iunfairly‘”trated by the Ghost of

Christmas Past, the Ghost of
Christmas Present and the Ghost of
Christmas Future. Why couldn't
they leave him alone and let him do
what he wanted? His only desire
was to be able to hate people and
be hated in return. Is that too much
to ask?

Just think of all the businessmen to

hatred of him. .I_ust think of all the
gossipy old ladies whose lives he
fulﬁlled because they were able to
tell scandalous stories about him.

Just think of all the joy he brought
whose rage he gave an outlet, so
they didn’t have to beat their
employees. Why, I'm willing to bet
that in the months following the
Christmas when Scrooge “saw the
light," the incidence of aggravated
assault against workers, wives and
children jumped by at least 50
percent.

And can you imagine the impact
of Scrooge's conversion on poor
little Tiny Tim? Life in the Cratchit
house before that fateful day must
have been tough enough on him.
That place was so full of sweetness
and light, it probably was not
unlike liying inside a giant,
150-"pound" bag of Domino can
sugar. They only thing that saved
them all from going absolutely
bonkers was the hardship caused
by Scrooge's miserable treatment
of Bob. the head of the household.

Afterwards. life there was
enough to make, a grown man
weep. Their one source of trauma,
their one source of rage, their one
source of controversy and their one
source of misery(all the things that
make life worth living), was taken

. away. f.r9m.. them. .A1l..that .w.a.is. .ief.t

it is the students who need ‘to

Sadat Betrclying Palestinian Cause

ByJULIE GRAHAM

Thirty years ago, in 1947, the
U.N. partitioned the land of
Palestine into two parts: one for the
Israeli colonizers, one for the
Palestinian people. In 1948, Israel
became a state. During the war that

followed, the Palestinian people '

were driven off the land they had
received and became refugees in
Israel, Syria, Jordan and Lebanon.
For 30 years,.the Palestinian people
have been refugees. Many have
lived in refugee camps, starving
and rotting away in idleness. The
world, and especially Israel, would
like to see these people assimilated
into the neighboring Arab countries
to liquidate the __Palestinian people

as a nation; but ‘the Arab countries p

have stood behind the Palestinians.
For 30 years, they have been uniﬁed
in refusing to recognize the Israeli
occupation ‘of this land.

Today, this unity among Arab
nations has been broken. Anwar
Sadat, the president of Egypt, went
recently to Jerusalem under the
pretense of preparing for the
Geneva Conference. During this

' visit, he said he had not come to

Israel to negotiate a separate peace
between Egypt and Israel; rather,
he was making preparations for
Geneva, including Israeli recogni-
tion of the legitimate rights of the
Palestinian people.

After the Jerusalem meeting,
Sadat called another preliminary
Geneva meeting in Cairo, inviting
all the Geneva participants.

Initially, Sadat invited two Ameri-
can professors of Palestinian origin,
whom he felt Israel would be willing
to negotiate with, rather than a
representative from the Palestinian
Liberation Organization. Even-
tually, he extended an invitation to
the PLO, which is recognized by the
U.N. as the legitimate representa-
tive of the Palestinian people.

By doing this, Sadat attempted to
undermine unity among the Pales-
tinians. The Arab people have
worked together in their opposition
to Israel but, since early November,
Sadat’s plans of peace with Israel
have not been told to the other Arab
nations until they have been made
public to the world. To combat

By NINA TRISTANI

There never has been anything in
the history of the United States like
the National Women’s Conference
in Houston. It was the largest
‘political conference of women ever
assembled in our country—1,442
delegates elected by 56 state
territorial public meetings, and 400
others selected by an overseeing
national commission. Women of
every age, occupation, income, race

and opinion were present. There
were rich and poor. There were

".white, black, yellow, Hispanic and

Indian women, as well as four
Eskimos. There were Democrats,
Republicans, radicals, conserva-
tives and the politically uninvolved.
Three First Ladies were guests:

Rosalynn Carter, Betty Ford and
Lady Bird Johnson. (Pat Nixon was
ill, and Jackie Onassis declined the
invitation).

A The goal of the Houston
Conference was to come up with a
National Plan of Action. The ﬁnal
draft was a 25-point, revised
National Plan of Action, based on
proposals drawn up by the
commission. By majority vote, the
delegates called for passage of the
Equal Rights Amendment, a
national health insurance plan with
special provisions for women and
the right to an abortion, along with
federal and state funds for those
who cannot afford one. Extension
of Social Security benefits for
housewives and a federal campaign
to educate women on their right to

credit also were called for. In
addition, the conference endorsed
elimination of job, housing and
credit discrimination against les-
bians and their right to have custody
of their children; an expansion of
bilingual education for minority
women; state-supported shelters
for beaten wives; federally and state

funded programs for victims of child,

abuse; education for rape preven-
tion; and a federal rural program
designed _to overcome “isolation,
poverty and underemployment. ’ ’
The three hottest issues of the
Conference were the ERA, abortion
and lesbian rights. Opponents of
the ERA have tried to scare the
public with exaggerated warnings
of legalized homosexual marriages,
unisex public toilets and other

Wednesday, December 7, 1977--THE PITT NEWS—Page 7

horrors. Advocates argue the ERA
would help women challenge
archaic laws that put them at a
disadvantage in matters such as
inheritance and property rights in
some states. Also, women would be
in a better position to win lawsuits
against employers charged with
discrimination in promotion and

' hiring. To get an idea of w at a

nationwide passage of the RA
would be like, take a look at
Pennsylvania or any other state that
has already passed the ERA.
Abortion was a tough subject for
many women to vote on. The
right-to-life supporters consider
abortion to be murder; pro-abortion
members do not. Where do you
draw the line? The ﬁnal decision for
many women was that a woman

should have the ability to decide for
herself whether or not she should
have an abortion. So the abortion
resolution was passed.

Sexual preference or lesbian
rights was not originally on the
agenda for Houston, but the
demand for lesbian rights came
from 36 state conventions. Some
delegates. felt lesbian rights was a
civil liberties issue, and not
appropriate, for a women's confer-
ence. But in the interest of unity,
the less radical women voted to pass
the homosexual rights resolution.
The resolution calls for the end to
discrimination on the basis of sex
and “affectional preference” in
child custody suits, housing,
employment, public accommoda-

The National Women’s Confer-

emotional and exciting time for

many women. The conference was ‘

run in a very disciplined manner. By
running the conference so tightly,
its organizers were left open to
criticism of rigging; there is some
justice to that criticism. Debate

majority vote and, since pro-plan
members were in the majority, they
could stop debates as often as they
wanted.

as a bold step towards real peace in

to kick out these colonizers. No
peace that is lasting will be
negotiated around a peace talk
table. People only will be possible
when the Israeli colonizers have
been kicked out and the Palestinian
people are able to return to their

It is vital Sadat rejoin the Arab

of all the Arab people, not just the

interests of Egypt. Egypt is in f,_¥‘\p

students crowded around him, he
said down on a red leather couch
behind a stack of his books.

“Hello, how are you?” Schwarz-
enegger has a thick Austrian
accent, and a surprisingly gentle
voice for a man with a physique that
won ﬁve Mr. Universe titles and six
Mr. Olympia titles.

While heartstruck women asked
him to sign nude Cosmopolitan
centerfolds of himself, weight-con-
scious men asked for advice on body
building. “It’s all in the book,”
replied Schwarzenegger, suggest-
ing some general tips on physical
ﬁtness. ,

Terence Doherty, publishing
representative for Simon and
Schuster, stood aside and watched.
“Arnold’s book has been a
phenomenal success—it has been
on the best selling list for weeks
now,” he said. “He makes an
impact everywhere he goes.” _

Schwarzenegger later conﬁrmed
Doherty’s statement. with a story
about a Miami book . center
one-third the size of Pitt’s. “There
were about 2,000 people already
waiting outside when I arrived, ” he
said, “and they tore their way into
the book store, and completely
demolished itl”

Books were torn, damaged and
thrown everywhere, leaving the
manager of the Miami store upset.
Schwarzenegger laughed at . the
memory. “Oh, Ihad a good time; I
like it,” he said.

tion of pizza available in Oakland
reveals is that it is incredibly varied
in taste. Thick crust to thin, spicy to
bland. there’s something for
everyone.

In each of the places visisted so

agar, the pizza was prepared in plain

view of the customer, should he
care to watch.

Visits to Sorrento’s, Larry and
Carol’s and Beto’s proved each was
an original so far as taste was
concerned.

Sorrento’_s

Location: 233 Atwood St.
Phone: 621-9129
Prices: Eight-cut (small) is
$2.70, medium (10-cut) is $3.25,
and large (12-cut) is $3.80. Extras
for small pizzas are 50 cents;
medium 60 cents and large is 70

3 cents.

E-xtras: Mushrooms, pepperoni,
sausage, onion, anchovies and gree
peppers. '

Comments: Features pizza
bagels at 50 cents with condiments
for 5 cents extra. Also serves
espresso and cappuccino. Delivers.

Atmosphere: Very pleasant,
with bright red furniture. This is
one place where the music is
played at just the right decibel
Ievel——not too loud. not too soft.
On the whole, a nice place to sit
down.

Phone: 687-1189

Prices: Junior (four slices) is
$1.44, medium (eight-cut) si $2.80,
and large (12-cut) runs about $3.56.
Extras are 40 cents for the junior
pizza, 70 cents for the medium and
85 cents for the large.

Extra: Mushrooms, pepperoni,
olives, ground beef, hot peppers,
green peppers, onions, anchovies
and sausage.

Comments: Larry and.Carol’s is
mostly carry out, but there is a
small side counter that seats four if
you’d rather eat it there. It's out of
the way (the walk is great for
joggers, but long nontheless) but
it’s worth the trip. Specials (pizza
with everything) are $3.18 for the
junior pizza, $5.57 for the medium
and $7.95 for the large. They also
spin the crusts. _

Atmosphere: Not geared for
eating. Paneled walls, wooden
counter and side counter and a pop
machine.

Quality: Very good. Sauce is
delicious——rather sweet. and ac-
‘cented with basil for a change. Lots
of cheese, so much that it’s
advisable to let the pizza cool a bit
before you bite in; otherwise. most
of the cheese will slide off.
Condiments were a bit sparse. but
the type tested ll€l‘(L‘ was anchovy
and a little goes a long way.

Prices: 30 cents for a single cut.

Comments: Mostly take out, but
you can sit at the counter if you
want. Fast service. Small and a bit
out of the way, but worth a visit.

Atmosphere: Again, mostly
carry out. Five stools around the
counter.

Quality: Very good. At last,
Sicilian pizza; sauce is simple and
tastes much like fresh tomatoes,
with a little oregano in passing.
Thick homemade crust is good and

crunchy, and a bit slick with olive-

o“il.i Condiments are literally
heaped on the pizza——Beto’s pizza
could actually pass as sandwiches,
you get so much. Cheese also is
used liberally, although it is
completely covered by extras.

Schwarzenegger, now 30, weighs
215 pounds, and is approximately
six feet tall. He keeps in shape by
lifting weights about three times a
week. But this is not all—he
recently earned a Golden Globe
Award for his performance in Bob
Rafelson’s movie on body-building,
“Stay Hungry.” -

Since “Pumping Iron,” Schwarz-
enegger has become more interest-
ed in acting, and plans to act again
in the near future. This spring,
Paramount Pictures will shoot
“Conan,” in which Schwarzeneg-
ger will play the title role.

“lt’s more a fantasy him than a
science ﬁction ﬁlm,” he said.
“John Milas, of ‘The Wind and the
Lion’ will direct.

“The shooting will cost around
$12 million to $15 million,”
Schwarzenegger added, ‘ ‘and prob-
ably will be out a year from now. So
far, there are no other actors picked
for the ﬁlm, only the director.”

Jack Bogut
And ‘Grits’

By RICHARD COOK

How many Pitt students have
ever eaten a farkelberry tart? Better
yet, who knows what farkelberry
grits look like? A true Pittsburgher
knows exactly what these taste
sensations mean. They are signs of
the beginning of the Christmas
season, and of the annual campaign
for Childrens Hospital. From Dec. 5
to Dec. 24, KDKA radio will
broadcast from major department
store windows in downtown Pitts-
burgh, collecting what is hoped to
be $1 million for Childrens Hospital.
Every person who contributes will
receive a sampling of farkelberry
grits and a chance to talk on the
radio. How did a station that
collected $2500 in 1968 raise the
amount to $930,000 in just eight
years? The answer is McDonald’s

and Jack Bogut.

When Bogut came to KDKA in
1968, the station was asking’
families to give Childrens Hospital a
penny a month for each child in their
family. Bogut was disillusioned by

the small amount of money coming ‘

in, and decided to expand on the
idea.

“You know you get what you ask
for, and it didn’t seem fair to me
that the mailmen get a hernia for so
small a cause,” Bogut said. “_Why
would you use 50,000 watts of radio
power and a bunch of so-called
high-priced personalities to collect

just $2500 in a two or three ,week_

campaign? Kidding around, we
said, you know paper is a lot easier
to mail the coins since you don’t

T have to glue it to cardboard, so why

not just stuff a dollar in the envelope
instead?” That year, KDKA
collected $12,000. .

KDKA started broadcasting from
department store windows in 1970,
and Jack attributes the success to
Margie Larson and her creation of
the Slithery Dee’. As a response to
what Jack’s radio character looked
like, Miss Larson sent in a ceramic
Slithery Dee, which Bogut put on
display downtown. The charge was
$1 per glimpse, donated to
Children’s Hospital.

In the following years, McDon-
ald’s got into the act, providing
farkelberry tarts, perogies, and this
year grits for KDKA to distribute to
its contributors. Each year, the
farkelberry creation draws more

people and more money, as thergx
KDKA campaign becomes synony 
I mous with Christmas.

People have been waking up to
Jack Bogut since he brought his
‘ warm sense of humor to Pittsburgh
some nine years ago. Born in
Montana, he got into radio by
accident. I
“Originally, I was a music
major, ” Bogut explained, “but I got
into radio becuase a guy who played
sax in our dance band would do
anything for money, even radio.

Someone opened up a small radio ya, ,
 iii.

station, and I was surprised to hear
Tom Harrington coming out of the
speaker one day. Well, I was quite
impressed, and I asked him how a
person gets into broadcasting. He
told me I had to make atape, which I

did, and sent it to the station
manager. Miraculously enough, I
got the job, and started at 6:05 a.m.
the next morning, with no idea in
the world as to what I was doing.
The show was a disaster but there
was no one there any better than
me,‘ so I was allowed to stay.”

Bogut worked in various stations
in Montana and Salt Lake City
before coming to Pittsburgh. As he
progressed, he gained experience,
and also gained some of his

.”well-known characteristics, such as;

Ethel and her magic garden hose.
“Ethel,” he said, “was actually a
crane operator in Billings, Montana
before she came to Pittsburgh to
blow reveille each morning.”
The most plausible reason for
Bogut’s success is his down-to-
earth humor and honesty. “Pitts-
burgh‘ can pickup a phony faster
than any other town I know,” he
said. “You have to be genuine. You
can’t criticize the town unless you
love it, and you have to demon-
strate that love by being involved in
the community and really working
at it.”
Bogut is genuine and very
‘mnvolved with Pittsburgh. He’s also
a little bit crazy—but Pittsburgh
and Childrens Hospital are grateful
to him. Who else could they find to
think up things like “Holidays can
be the pits without your Farkelberry
Grits.”

The sounds of “The Tennessee

A black curtain opened, showing

Pittsburgh Laboratory Theater’s
current production, “Friedman and

professor Mark Harris, is an
attempt at experimental theater. It
is an attempt that fails.

A.B. Ferguson "(Chris Blaetz) is
the son of Solomon Friedman (Bob
Fitzpatrick). Ferguson is a writer
and seems very successful. He and
his father have not exchanged a
word in four and a half years.

for his father, one to the father for
his son. He’s a con man who lies,

questioning lyrics of “Saddle
Tramp" and the self-reliant atti-
tude of “Long Haired Country
Boy” drew loud cheers of approval
from the feisty crowd. “Saddle
Tramp” last over 10 minutes,
showing hot guitar licks by Daniels
and Tommy Crain. But the treat
was the heated drum work by the
two percussionists.

The new pieces done at concerts
are what make each show differ-
ent. They show where the band is
heading, and they sell the new
album.

The next song, “Midnight
Wind,” is the excellent title track
from the band’s newest release.
The song works with its vocals and
harmonies better than usual. The
instrumentation is as good as ever
and keyboard man “Taz” DiGreg-
orio shines.

Daniels’ blues songs are, per-
haps, his best efforts lyrically, and
maybe overall. But the only blues
performed Monday were the
“Birmingham Blues.”

,“Cumberland Mountain No.
Nine” was next. The lights

court case with Friedman. Fried-
man refused to sell his real estate to
the. trio, called the ‘ Federated

they wanted it to build a parking lot.
Grossman heard the case, during
which Friedman called the judge “a

the second time this year, the first
being at the Three Rivers Arts
Festival in June. Although most of

the works were repeated, seeing
them on a proscenium stage with
proper lighting made a tremendous
difference. -

Kathryn Posin, artistic director
and choreographer for the six-year-
old company, is not' new to
Pittsburgh. In 1976-1977, she
served as the Pittsburgh Dance
Council’s Afﬁlliate Artist.

Last weekend’s program opened
with “Waves,” danced by the
entire company. Beginning on their

dimmed and Crain performed a
ﬁne guitar solo to precede the man

'whose name has become synono-

mous with the ﬁddle: , Charlie
Daniels.

The fast-‘ﬁngered ﬁddler makes
even the most sedate tap their toes.
During “Redneck Fiddlin’ Man,”
three couples from the Grand Ole
Opry appear on stage left and do
some fancy square dancing. The
«crowd, moved with the spirit,
responded with the loudest cheer of
the evening.

Three encores followed: “Tex-
as,” from the “Nightrider” album,
“The South’s Gonna Do It”
dedicated to Duane Allman and
Ronnie Van Zant and an energetic
15-minute version of the “Orange
Blossom Special,” complete with
dancers.

The Charlie Daniels Band is
moving in new directions. The
backdrop adds color and environ-
ment. The dancers add even more
life to an already lively situation
and a big plus—culture. This
leaves one more question: In what
direction do they go now?

 “Friedman and Son”-- Acting Almos

Friedman’s son paid his ﬁne, and-

they stopped talking.

Sound a little confusing? It is. The
plot is hard to follow, and you ﬁnd
yourself asking questions that are
never answered. Why did they stop
talking? What was the court case all
about? A synagogue is building a
parking lot? Why did Friedman call
the judge a stinker?

Schimmel wants the mayor and
the judge to speak at the dinner
honoringFriedman. And he wants
Miss Prior (Trish Beatty), assistant
superintendent of schools, and
Ferguson’s publisher, Benjamin
Waxman, Jr. to speak at the dinner
in honor of the writer. But Prior and
Waxman hate Ferguson. And the

knees in a back corner, the dancers
simulated small, rocking waves as
they moved their bodies in an
undulating mass. The - dancers’
movements paralleled wave action,
causing a ripple to move from body
to body. Simple blue and green
costumes, especially the backless
leotards of the women, added to the
effect. The amount of interesting
movement occurring simultaneous-
ly across the stage made it hard to
concentrate on a ‘single area of

But the story has a good ending.
Friedman and Ferguson realize
Schimmel is a crook, and reconcile
their differences without “the help of
$15,000 testimonial dinners.

would have been better off had thev
left “Friedman and Son”
somewhere in the hills of California.
If you forget the plot, which you
can’t, there are (thank heaven) a

space, thus some of the movement
was lost.

The music, by Laurie Spiegel,
was a simple, repetitive woodwind
piece well suited to the repetitive
quality of the dance. Evolving from
the same basic movement, the

women balanced on the men in a
ﬁnal striking pose.

“Light Yearts, Four Plays for a
Quarter,” was an intricate exami-
nation of pinball machines. Glen
Eddy strode on stage in tight black
pants and white shirt. He began
working the levers of an imaginery
pinball machine by thrusting his’
pelV1S and jerking his arms and
shoulders. Following four frustra-
ting plays, he spun around,
shouting, “Damn” the stage
blacked out, lit up again, and ﬁve
other dancers weaved on stage to
the music ofJohn McLaughlin and
the Mahavishnu Orchestra. Dress-,
ed in tight, satiny shorts and
tops in various combinations of
black and white, the dancers
fulﬁlled the sexual fantasiesof the
pinball player in a series of four
plays of the ball. The work was well
executed, with the exception of the
fourth play, where lack of unity was
evident. .-

“Ghost Train,” the funniest
piece, was more of a character than
a movement study. An entourage of
ghosts—ranging from greaser, to
aristocrat, to frumpy old bag
lady—trudged across the stage to
the music of Meredith Monk. Posin,
as the typical bag lady, stole the
scene as she scavenged everything
within reach. . .. . . .

conniving, and shrewd Jewish
businessman. He is at home on

lity Performance

“Bach Pieces,” provided a,vivid
contrast. It consisted of two solos, a

duet and a concerto with the entire
cast. The two solos, performed by
Lance Westergard and Holly Reeve,
were 'balletic and showed their
tremendous control. The duet,
danced by Eddy and Marsha White,
was remarkable in the way their

long bodies by complemented each
other. The concerto was a light,
enjoyable piece in which the
dancers played off of each other’s
movements.

Although excellent performers,
the Kathryn Posin Dance Company
does have a few deﬁciencies. Since
Posin is the choreographer, she
appears more comfortable than the
other dancers in her own move-
ment. She also has a strength about
herestage presence that is at times
dominant over the rest of the
company.

Technically speaking, Posin is
certainly not the strongest dancer.
Sometimes she gets too bogged
down in shapes in her choreogra-
phy, and forgets about the ﬂow
that's necessary to make move-
ments appear easy and natural,
though they may very well be
neither. Posin also _overuses a few
movements: turns, arabesques,
and sickled-foot positions (turned
in).‘

Overall, the company showed
Pittsburgh a refreshing look at
dance. There is a nice balance in its
repertoire, blending modern, jazz
and ballet movements with a variety
of music ranging from classical to
rock. .

Daniels Band --

ByK_EITHBRIAN
Pitt Newsstaff Write:

Under a huge black cowboy hat
sat the tired but friendly Charlie
Daniels.

“We’ve been on the road since
early September with the new set, ’ ’
he said. “The dancers joined us
about six weeks ago in St. Louis. In
fact, it was the night of the plane
crash (which killed members of the
Lynyrd Skynyrd Band). Yea, I sang
at Ronnie's (Van Zant) funeral; I
sang, ‘Peace in the Valley/” Dan-
iels said._ .

“Well, anyway, we're off to
Raleigh for our next show, but that

won't be for about six days,” he
said. “I’m looking forward to our
Christmas party—we should be
having it pretty soon.”

“Yeah, me too,” chimed in
Tommy Crain,’ guitarist from
Daniels’s band. “It ought to be a
good one.”

Crain,‘ 26, from Comersville,
Tennessee, wrote “Cumberland
Mountain Number Nine” and
“Tennessee.”

‘ Crain left the concrete cubicle in
the caverns of the Civic Arena to
check on the dismantling of the set.
Daniels said the road sometimes
can be a creative atmosphere.

As Rowdy As The Fans

When asked about the acoustics
of the Arena, Daniels said, “These
halls weren’t made for music, and I
really can’t do anything more to
make the sound any better.”

Backstage

The “redneck fiddler” said he
wishes he could spend more time
with his family, and has cut his
touring days per year from his usual
250 to just under 200.

Who does Daniels think is the
best_ guitar picker today? “Well, uh,

I think our Tommy Crain is pretty
good,” he said.

Crain, on cue, entered the room
again with a woman telling her to
“Just wait for your birthday pie.”

It seems the band has a custom of
hitting “birthday people” with
pies.

Crain said, “Yeah, I got it with a
cream pie, but you should’ve seen
Daniels! He must have gotten it
with about 20. ” Charlie took off his
hat and chuckled.

Crain, who finished writing two
songs last week, said, “I write

mountain songs, anything to do
with mountains. They're called
‘Running Up the Mountain’ and
‘Twin Pines Cattle Company.’ ”

While the band was staying at the
Marriott in Greentree, Crain said,
“I was walking through the lobby;
some guy from the band that plays
there told me they play ‘The South’s
Gonna Do It Again’ and he said ‘We
play it better than you all do.’ I
didn't know how to take that.”

Daniels leaned back and smiled
contentedly, saying, “I like it when
other people do my songs; it’s a
compliment. ’ ’

«   Townshend, Lane Succeed As a Duo

By JOHN IVANCHAN

Rough Mix
Peter Townshend and Ronnie Lane
MCA 2295

“Rough Mix,” from the new
team of Peter Townshend, from the
Who, and Ronnie Lane, of Faces, is
a tasty blend of music and words
from members of two of recent
rock’s most inﬂuential bands.
Along with revealing and emotional
lyrics, the disc is a musical
achievement, ‘especially with the
backup help of_ Eric Clapton and
John F.-ntwistle, the Who’s bassist.

This is Townshend’s ﬁrst work
outside the Who since his initial
solo effort, the much-overlooked

“_Who Came First.” The multi-
talented guitarist, has recently
been credited with being one of the
inspirations for many of today's
punk rockers. As well as appearing
in and rewriting the soundtrack for
the movie “Tommy,” and writing
his third piece for Rolling Stone
Magazine, Townshend reportedly
is back in the studio with the Who
again. ,
Land played bass for another of
rock’s jovial bands, Faces, with
Rod ‘Stewart. Although he was
overshadowed by other band
members like Stewart and present
Rolling Stone, Ronnie Wood, Lane
is a versatile bassist. Both he and
Townshend play a variety of
acoustic and electric guitars,

mandolins and basses, along with
“very involved mind games.”
The games start on side one with
“My Baby Gives It Away,” a
risque Who-like song, containing
ﬁne guitar work characteristic of
past Townshend enterprises. A
harmonica and banjo ﬂavor Lane’s

I folksy‘ “Nowhere to Run,” one of

the album’s ﬁne ballads.

The tempo picks up with the title
cut,/a Faces-like jam that show-
cases the abilities of both Town-
shend and Lane, along with some
decent work from Clapton. Clap-
ton’s presence, supposedly amajor
contributing factor, is signiﬁcant
because he is a very close
companion of Townshend. Town-
shend helped Clapton kick his

heroin addiction and organized the
Rainbow concert, Clapton’s first
comeback appearance. “Rough
Mix” is energized by the Town-
shend-Clapton interplay, the excel-
lent, driving bass of Lane and some
ﬁne organ by someone listed as
“Rabbit.” The side closes with
“Catme1ody,” a bouncy tune
supported by strong saxophone
lines. «
“Misunderstood” opens side
two with Townshend singing about
the loss of his youth and his wish to
mature with “graying temples.”
The rhythm of an urban day is
captured in “Street in the City,”
sparked by Townshend’s probing,
cynical lyrics.
‘The highpoint of the side is

“Heart to Hang On To,” a moving
duet bolstered by some fine brass
from E-ntwistle. The song, bearing
a close resemblance to Town-
shend’s earlier masterpiece, “Love
Reign O’er Me,” contains some of
the album’s best acoustic perform;
ances, which mix well with the

lyrical theme of the pains of _,

lonliness.

The side concludes with “Till the
Rivers All Run Dry,” another love
song with both Clapton and
F.-ntwistle aiding some strong

Townshend-Lane vocals.

“Rough 'Mix” is a surprisingly
well-balanced album from two old
hard rockers.

Aces_ Flush 
Pitt, 90-83

By BOB LABRIOLA
pm News S12tflWI’ilC|'

Pitt’s ﬁrst road show was a ﬂop,
as the Panthers, plagued by fouls
and turnovers, lost to Evansville,
90-83, last night before 6,000 at
Roberts Stadium in Evansville,
Indiana.

Although the game was sloppy
(29 turnovers by each team), the
Purple Aces kept their poise during
the last ﬁve minutes to register their
first win since becoming a Division I
basketball school.

Tim Grgurich started Sam

Clancy, Larry Harris, Wayne
Williams, Terry Knight and Pete
Strickland, the third combination
the Panther coach has tried this
season.
I The opening minutes of the first
half were disastrous for Pitt, as the
Panthers were whistled for eight
turnovers in the ﬁrst ﬁve minutes;
Williams and Knight found them-
selves in serious foul trouble before
the half was 10 minutes old with
three and four, respectively.

Nevertheless, the Panthers took a
17-13 lead largely on the efforts of
Harris and Clancy. Evansville
center Steve Miller took over from
there, controlling the backboards
and scoring two quick baskets as the
Purple Aces ran off 10 unanswered
points.

Harris tied the game at 23, but
Evansville was consistently able to
work the ball inside to Mike Duff
(6-7), Taylor (6-5) and Washington
(6-3), and the Panthers soon were
down, 34-29.

The Purple Aces held a-four- to
six-point lead until, with 2:05 left in
the half, Scott Nedrow ﬁred in four
quick points and the gap was only
two, 46-44. Another turnover by

_ Pitt (the Panthers had 16 in the ﬁrst
half) squashed a chance to tie the
.-game and Evansville had a
four-point bulge at halftime, 50-46.
The 50 points Pitt gave up in the
first half were three more than "Kent
State scored in Pitt’s prior game.

The opening minutes of the
second half found Pitt with another
severe case of butterﬁngers, the
Panthers turning the ball over twice

« in the ﬁrst minute, and the Purple

Aces built the lead to eight, 54-46.

Harris answered with six straight
points for Pitt but another inside
hoop by Taylor, coupled with a steal
and lay-up, brought the cushion

back to six, 58- 52. For the next
seven minutes, Pitt would whittle
the lead and Evansville, on the
strength of its front line, would
rebuild it, heading the Panthers by
10 points with 12:19 left in the
game.

Sonny Lewis lit a ﬁre under the
Panthers with his scoring and
ball-handling; Pitt tied the game
with authority on a Harris slam with
7:17 to play, 70-70. Evansville
countered‘ with ﬁve points to
assume the lead again, but ”a
three-point play by Lewis and a
jumper by Harris tied another
knot, 75-75, with an even ﬁve
minutes remaining. 8

After the Purple Aces scored on
their next possession, Nedrow was
called for an offensive foul and then
a technical for protesting too
vigorously and the ensuing foul
shots and a back-door lay-up put
Pitt down by ﬁve again, 80-75.
Following yet another Panther
turnover, Clancy picked up his ﬁfth
foul with 2:20 to go and the cofﬁn
was all but nailed shut.

“When the score was tied at 75,

we have to move the ball and talrep

our time on offense,” Grguric"‘n
explained. ,“It’s the tough part of
the game, and we’ve got to suck it
up and put the ball in the hole.
We’ve got to make our lay-ups, and
we just didn’t do it.”

The game ‘ended with two
Panthersfighting for a rebound and
losing the ball to an Evansville
player under the hoop who scored to
make the finalfxscore 90-83.

q “We have to learn to win on the
road,” he concluded, ”but ﬁrst we
have to learn how to win, period.”

fourth tally of the season—but the
Tigers notched four more scores in
the third frame, and Pitt found itself
on the short end of a 8-1 margin._

The cross-state foes staged an
even battle throughout the ﬁrst two
periods, but a Pitt scoring display,
highlighted by Hetz’s hat trick,
prevailed.

“We slacked off a bit near the end
of the second period,” Barcalow
explained, “but overall, we played
like the days of old.”

Pitt’s Tim Duffy got things rolling

goal of the year, before Steve

Marsh Misses Starting;
Reserve Role Reviewed

By KAREN KADILAK
Pitt News Staffwriler

It takes a special type of athlete
to be a cornerback on a football
team. The cornerback has to be
quick enough to cover the fastest
pass receivers, yet strong enough
to take on offensive guards who
often outweigh him by as much as
60 pounds. He also has to be smart
enough to read the quarterback,
and cool enough to handle those
occasions when he is beaten on
pass coverage.

By the same token, it takes a

special type of athlete to be a-

backup cornerback. Pitt’s Willie

   

WILLIE MARSH

Marsh, this year’s designated
backup cornerback, said it isn’t
easy playing. second ﬁddle at the
position many consider to be the
hardest in football.

“You have to be mentally

I prepared at all times,” Marsh said.

“You never know when you’re
going to go into the game, and it's
hard enough ordinarily to play
cornerback. It’s a lonely position.
When you’re beaten on the long
pass, it’s even lonlier.

Early this season, the junior
ﬁlled in at both left and right
cornerback when starters J .C.
Wilson and LeRoy Felder were out
with arm injuries.

Marsh started four games-
against Boston College, Florida,

, Tulane and Army—saw action in

all the others, and may play against

Clemson“ in the Gator Bowl in
Jacksonville, Fla. Dec. 30

‘‘I like pressure games,” Marsh
said. “Pressure never bothered me
and I hope it never will. The
Penn State game excited me for
that reason. The competition’s
great in a game like that, too. -It
makes the game more enjoyable.”

With both Wilson and Felder
graduating this year, Marsh is
expected to step in at either of the
two cornerback positions. Most
likely, he will inherit Wilson’s spot
on the left. He began at that
position this season before injuries
to the entire defensive backﬁeld
forced him to ﬁll in on the right

5 side, also.

Disgruntled with himself after a
freshman season in which he was
shufﬁed from wide receiver to
defensive back (he was even
considered a top wingback pros-’
pect), Marsh withdrew from school
after his first year.

“I was disappointed in myself
more than anything,” Marsh

' explained. “The yearl came up

(1974), the situation wasn’t like it is
now for the freshmen. You don’t
have freshmen playing the _way we
do now.

“Matt (Cavanaugh), Willie (Tay- J

lor), Elliot (Walker)-—th_at was the

1 years those guys came up,” the

New Jersey native continued.
“Elliot was the only one who
played much that year. I went
home for a while looking for a job
after that season. There was
nothing available, so I came back
here. Iwas lucky they game me my
scholarship back and everything. I
don’t even want to think about that
now.”

Marsh, and the rest of the
Panthers, who began practice for
the Gator Bowl today, are now"
thinking about other things—like
Clemson. ~

“They have a good ball club,”
Marsh said, echoing what almost
everyone on the Pitt’s team has
said at one time or another.
“They'll throw the ball, too. We'll"
have to be ready for them.”

For Willie Marsh, that means
more ways than one.

Road Trip

cliffhanger at the second intermis-
sion. .

Hetz, who registered ﬁve points
on the trip, scored his third
unanswered goal to put things out of
reach only two.minutes into theﬁnal
period. The Quakers and Panthers
exchanged lone tallies, but it was
immaterial, as Pitt had its second
win of the year in the bag.

“Although we lost the ﬁrst game
badly, we didn’t disgrace any-
body,” Barcalow said. “I said
before we left that we’d be happy
with a split, and we got it.

“We’ll be O.K. from here on in.
That meeting straightened a lot of
things out. I think the guys got the
message now.”

Sophomore co-captain Steve‘

Fendler’s 189 score,‘ Mike Man-

I. jerovic’s 177, Rich Louden’s 175‘

and Mitch Haber’s 172 led the way
in the Panthers’ ﬁrst-game win of
868-811. Pitt opened the game with
an early lead, and, with consistent
and steady bowling, iced the game
in the ninth frame.

In the second game, the Bearcats
came out ﬁring, taking an early
lead and threatening to blow the

game wide open. But the Panthers
stayed right with them and tied the
score in the ninth frame before
losing, 892-859.

Manjerovic’s 2l4'and sophomore
Jeff Kretz’s 183 led the way in the
third game, as. Pitt blew 5” the

great poise. We refused- to fold in
the second game, came back in‘ the

handily.” ‘

Pitt used only ﬁve bowlers, all of
whom bowled well. Manjerovic’s
589, Haber’s 524, Kretz’s 507,
Fendler’s 494 and Louden’s sur-
prising 488 were by far the. best

performances the young Panthers

“I trwomie in the present, and I try not toget too serious
about anything. I guess that is part of the existentialist view I
learned from one of my classes,” he joked.

Two things that “The Strick,” as his friends call him, does
take seriously are basketball and the theater.

As a point-guard on the Panther team, Strickland doesn’t
take a lot of shots during the game—he feels a good job of
initiating the offense is just as important in Pitt’s scoring

fne...in the alumni section of the Field House.”

‘ Strickland," a speech and theater arts major, found that his
acting performances sometimes conflict with his athletic
obligations. In late October, when he portray.ed Botard in the
Studio Theater’s presentation of “Rhinoceros,” a typical day

’PETE STRICKLAND ‘ whenever a fight breaks out on the court, you’ll always see 

It’s easy to tell that.ac'ting is special to Strickland, who ’
described it as “something that makes me feel alive. I never

 I  A ’ get sick of it, and I hope I never will.”

Because he plays and acts before a crowd of people, it

I might appear that both of his interests are similar, but

; T “It has to do with interaction,” he explained. “When I’m

playing well in a game, I really don’t hear anything except the

  ' coaches and the team. It’s'as if the crowd is not even there. 

 

But I love to act in plays where the audience is involved, and
I’m very much aware of their presence. Then, I can try to
play off the spectators’ reactions. '1 can use some im-

I I I
provisation.” ~ . ,
When Strickland manages to get a little free time between
’ acting and basketball, he enjoys attending plays or movies,
tartin g at $1 0

and has a penchant for travel.

“Last summer I just took off a couple of weeks and drove
around from D.C. to Boston, and into some other states. I
should add that my car died in Pennsylvania, but I left it and
thumbed a ride back. It was great.”

acting, I’d do it. I haven’t yet found out how good an actor I
could be, but I’d definitely say I want acting to be a part of  «,,,,
my future.” W‘ ( ,7
