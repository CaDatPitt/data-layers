Pitt meets
with Senate
committee

By Pat McAteer
Staff Writer

Four Pitt administrators met
with the Pennsylvania Sen-

_ate Appropriations Committee

Wednesday morning to discuss
why Pitt doesn’t deserve a 30
percent cut in state funding.

The meeting with Pitt officials
and the Senate Appropriations
Committee came in response
to the latest Wave of proposed
funding cuts ‘for Pennsylva-
nia’s state-related institutions,
including Pitt, Penn State and
Temple University. Pitt adminis-
trators took their time to plead

Port Authority holds public hearing on proposed cuts

By Nate Kreichman
V Staﬁ” Writer

Students who bus to the airport
with Port Authority of Allegheny
County may face a transportation
hurdle starting in September.

If proposed cuts to Port Author-
ity’s services go through, begin-
ning on Sep. 2 the 28X bus route

will end at Robinson Town Centre,

stranding riders more than seven
miles from the Pittsburgh Interna-
tional Airport.

On Wednesday, Port Author-
ity held a 12-hour public hearing
at the David L. Lawrence Conven-
tion Center Downtown. Hundreds
of individuals_ pre—registered for
time slots to speak in front of the
Agency’s board members, includ-
ing CEO Stephen Bland. The hear-

ing limited oral testimony to three
minutes per speaker and divided
the group between a large confer-
ence room and a smaller “over—
ﬂow” room.

Port Authority spokesperson
Jim Ritchie said the number of peo-
ple who wanted to speak skyrock-
eted this year from years past, with
both rooms entirely booked.

For the coming ﬁscal year, Port
Authority will face a $64 million
budget deﬁcit. Barring new’legis—
lation and labor agreements, Port
Authority’s proposal on the table
suggests higher fares and a 35, per-
cent reduction in service. Many
routes stand to be eliminated and
more will see reduced frequency
and shortened span of service. All
but 13 routes will end service at 10
p.m., seven days a week.

“For years Port Authority has

provided services on what you
might call its core bus lines for a
tremendous span of time through

the day. Some of these routes ran .

all but four hours a day for the most
part. So, that just won’t exist any-
more,” Ritchie said.

Port Authority estimates that
45,000 riders will be left without

“service.

Port Authority of Allegheny
County was created by a state law
and is primarily funded by the state
government. The bill that created
the institution requires it to have a
balanced budget every year.

1 “Our deﬁcit is $64 million and
to make up that much money, you
have to cut an amount of service
that gets you that amount of mon-
ey,” Ritchie said. “It’s pretty simple
math.” l

Despite the economic necessity,

Under PortAuthority proposed cuts
All buses will end service at 10 p.m. except:

8 Perrysville 51 Carrick
16 Brighton V 61 B Braddock—Swis_svale
27 Fairywood 71A Negley ‘

' 61 Brighton 82 Lincoln
27 Fairywood 86_Liberty.

91 Butler Street

G2 West Busway — All stops

P1 East Busway — All Stops

Ritchie said the cuts would make
the city’s public transit system in-
adequate and that the reductions
should not be made. . '
“None of the services on that list
should be cut, there’s no reason for
it,” he said. “These are buses that
are full, these are buses that are

  

necessary, they’re providing good
services in areas where there’s a
demand and pulling them out is
counterproductive  there’s no fat
in the system to cut anymore.”

the case of Pitt’s impact on West-
ern Pennsylvania and the state as
awhole.

Under Gov. Tom Corbett’s

proposed budget, which he an-
nounced on Feb. 8, Pitt stands to
lose $41 million in funding, or 30
percent, from $136.1 million to
$95.3 million.
- Paul Supowitz, Pitt’s Vice
Chancellor of Governmental Re-
lations, said he thought Wednes-
day’s* meetings in Harrisburg
went “very well.” He said that Pitt
Chancellor Mark Nordenberg
answered a series of questions
from the committee regarding
issues such as the direct effects
the cuts have on Pitt, including
rising tuition costs, as well as the
University’s economic impact on
the regional economy.

“The legislators were very

positive about the impact of
the University of Pittsburgh,”
Supowitz said in regard to Pitt’s
relations with the state. “I think
they appreciated that. They
asked questions about what the
cuts mean [to Pitt] and the re-
gional impact.”

Supowitz said that along with
Nordenberg, three other Pitt of-
ﬁcials spoke, including Provost
and Senior Vice Chancellor Pa-
tricia Beeson, Chief Financial
Officer Arthur Ramicone and the
dean of Pitt’s Medical School, Ar-
thur Levine.

Supowitz said that members
of the Appropriations Commit-
tee, including committee chair-
man state _Sen. Jake Corman, R-
Centre, expressed their desire to
stop the cuts.

Cameron Kline, Corman’s
spokesman, said Senate Appro-
priations hearings provide the
committee with an opportunity
to assess the budgetary needs of
state-funded agencies.

PORTAllTHORITY

FROM PAGE l-

Brandon Hill, stoodin the rain
outside of the convention center
holding a sign that read, “Port Au-
thority, bad management, don’t
blame the drivers,” don’t, blame
[Gov. Torn] Corbett.”

Hill said that the Port Author-
ity’s upper management was to
blame for the organization’s bud-
get woes. ' ‘ s

“Somebody needs to investi-
gate them thoroughly,” Hill said.
“They’re uncontrollable, they’re
a runaway freight train.”

The individuals present at the
hearing could be roughly divided
into four groups. ' A ‘

Hill represents the ﬁrst group,
made up of those who believe
the budget crisis is the result of
a spending problem. The second
held the state government account-
able, claiming the mess stems from
a lack of adequate funding.

Pittsburghers for Public Tran-
sit, an all—volunteer organization of
transit riders and drivers, handed
out pamphlets that said “the state
has failed to ﬁnd a stable, dedi-
cated source of funding for transit

“All the agencies come in, and
what they’re doing is ﬁrst of all
making themselves available to
the appropriations committee so
that the committee can ask them
about their budgets and their
needs,” Kline said. '

Kline said ‘the Appropriations
Committee hearings in both the
state House of Representatives
and state Senate allow for assess-
ment of the governor’s budget.
He said the committee takes into
account “the social priorities and
the needs of the Commonwealth
for next year.”

Before Corbett ﬁnalizes the
budget, both the House and Sen-
ate create their own budgets. Af-
ter deliberation,.both chambers
settle on a ﬁnal yearly budget
that the governor must sign by
the end ofjune.

In regard to Corman’s opin-
ion on the cuts, Kline said the
senator wants as many resources
given to schools as possible after
seeing the impact of Penn State

for 20 years.” ‘ ,
“You shouldn’t be holding this
meeting, political leaders should

A be holding this" meeting,” Don

Goughler, the president of Family
Services of Western Pennsylvania,
said to Port Authority’s representa-
tives in his testimony. “They have

need of you and believe it or not,

you have need of us.” _
By noon, what had been one

picketer had become a legion, but .

with an entirely different mes-
sage.
” This was the third group, mostly

made up of members of the Occupy ‘ _

movement and similar movements,
claiming that the cuts would be un-
necessary if the state had a more
equitable tax code. They stood

_ chanting, some holding signs that

read, “Public Transit need a ﬁx, we
know how: Tax the rich,” and “No
more austerity for yinz.”

Inside the hearings, one occupi- _

er said, “We do not have a spending

problem, we do not have afunding ‘

problem, we have a priority prob-
lem,” to near—universal applause.
The ﬁnal group pointed no
ﬁngers. They were only there to
describe why they needed public
transportation and plead their
cases. Many were handicapped
and rely on the Port Authority’s

on his ownconstituency. He said
Penn State is the largest employ-
er in the area and that students

fuel the local economy.

“Senator Corman has been
very vocal about funding for
higher ed,” Kline said. “This is a
process. I don’t think all 50 sena-
tors come together and say ‘Yes,
this is a number.”’

On Monday, Corman told The
Pitt--News he opposed any cuts in
funding toward Pitt or any of the
state-related universities.

“I’m going‘ to do my best to
not have any cuts this year,” he
said. V

Although the support toward
state-related universities ap-
peared to be on the rise in the
Senate Appropriations Commit-
tee, members of the committee

also acknowledged that Pennsyl— ~

vania faces tough economic cir-
cumstances with a deﬁcit reach-
ing over $4 billion in 2011.
Brittany Bartkus, director of
policy development for state Sen.‘

 

ACCESS program, which provides.

door-to-door, shared ride trans-
portation for senior citizens and
people with disabilities who make
advance reservations.

Ritchie said that this group

’ ‘would be hit hardest. To be eligible

for ACCESS, a rider must live within
three-quarters of a mile of an exist-
ing Port Authority route. Because

so many routes are being elimi— A

nated, signiﬁcantly fewer people
will be able to us_e_the service.

“People who rely on [ACCESS]
and have no way otherwise to get
to transit are entirely cut off,” he
said. “_The impact on ACCESS may
be far, far greater than any impact
on the regular system.”

Ritchie said that in the end, re-
gardless of who one blames for the

service reductions, the hearing was A

crucial because it provided citizens
with an opportunity to have their
voices heard.

“The good thing, if there is
a good thing in all this, is that
when you have an event like this
you start to see all the different
kinds of people who are concerned
about it and are engaged in it and
want to help,” he said. “I think that
what we’re seeing, bottom-line, is
a strong showing of support for
public transport.”   '

Wayne Fontana, D-Allegheny,
whose constituency encompass-
es a large portion of Pitt’s cam-

pus, said in an email that Corbett .

made it clear in his ﬁrst budget
that his administration will “use
cost-cutting maneuvers” to save
money. _ .

She said that all state organi-
zations now face reduced bud-
gets and colleges and universi-
ties are no exception. “ ~ '

Bartkus said the recent round
of cuts places the challenge in
the hands of universities. She
said they must now re-examine
ways to reduce spending without
moving the burden onto students
and parents through increases in
tuition. .

“I think the best we can hope
for from these hearings" is that
funding for the University of
Pittsburgh be ﬂat funded for ﬁs-
cal year 2012-2013,” Bartkus
said. “An allocation of $136.1 mil-
lion may not be ideal, but it is bet-
ter than a decrease in funding.”

STICKING MY NECK our

Religious views should not exempt
S hospitals from mandate

Act, employers are required to cover preventative

  

By Tracey Hickey
Columnist

You’d have to live underground to miss the debate
over the Affordable Care Act —— speciﬁcally, its
mandate that employers in- A
sure birth control.

Doctors and feminists are
calling this a victory for wom-
en’s health, but the United
States Conference of Catholic
Bishops claims that the Obama
administration’s refusal to ex-
empt Catholic. hospitals and
universities —- which, accord-
ing to the Ofﬁcial Catholic Di-
rectory, comprise 12 percent
of all the hospitals in the Unit-
ed States -—— from this require-
ment is a threat to‘ religious
freedom. Pro—life Catholics
especially view the lack of ex-
emption as part of a broader
assault on their values by the
President’s pro-family plan-
ning agenda.

Obama — or rather, the
Affordable Care Act and the
Department of‘ Health and
Human Services —— isn’t requiring Catholic hos-
pitals to cover birth control out of spite, to chal-
lenge their values or to force them to conform to
pro-choice views. It’s much’ simpler and much
less devious than that.,Under the Affordable Care

\

medicine for their

employees, and whether the

Vatican approves of birth control or not, modern
medical institutions — including the Department

of Health and Hum
dent nonproﬁt Insti

MCT Campus

an Servicesand the indepen-
tute of Medicine — considers
it preventative’ care. Catho-
lic hospitals are forced to
cover birth control for the
same reason they’re forced to
cover STD testing. and cancer
screenings.

Religious opponents of
birth control coverage depict
the Pill as having one purpose
and one alone: to allow wom-
en to have sex without con-
sequences. But in fact, hor-'
monal birth control is used
to treat endometriosis, Poly-
cystic Ovary Syndrome and
Premenstrual Dysphoric Dis-
order. Taking hormonal birth
control lowers a woman’s risk
of ovarian cancer and cysts.
It’s used to treat low estrogen
levels, which are associated
with poor bone health, and
excessively heavy menstrual
bleeding, which is associated

with increased risk of anemia.

Even when used

for its “traditional” purpose,

birth control is preventative medicine. Although

obviously not an illness, pregnancy is very

much like an illness for insurance pur- '

poses: If you contract it, you must shell out
for a lot of expensive and time-consuming
doctor’s visits or risk seriousillness and
death.

Religious institutions that oppose pre-
marital sex may declare that they don’t
want to pay for a woman’s sexual immo-
rality, but unless Catholic hospitals re-
fuse to cover prenatal care" if the pregnant
employee is not married to the father of

her child — needless to say, probably not
what Jesus would do — they’re paying
for it anyway. Because prenatal health-
care — to say nothing of the astronomical
costs of a hospital birth — is hundreds of
times more expensive than birth control,
refusing to cover the latter ultimately
costs your insurance company, and any-
one whose taxes subsidize it, a great deal
more money. According to the Guttmach-
er Institute, unintended pregnancies cost
U.S. taxpayers $11.1 billion dollars a year,
and that’s only factoring in public insur-
ance costs for prenatal and ﬁrst-year in-
fant care.

When a religious organization has im-
mense power and inﬂuence — for exam-

ple, it controls 12 percent of the hospitals
in the United States — and that organiza-
tion is subsidized by the government, the
government has a responsibility to ensure
that the organization prioritizes the well-
being of those it serves over the propaga-
tion of its religious tenets. If the Catholic
hospital system decided it was immoral
for a female doctor to examine a patient’s
breasts for cancerous lumps and adulter-
ous for a male doctor to do so, could we
really allow the hundreds of thousands of
women they employ to go without breast
cancer screenings? Would that be consid-
ered a matter of religious freedom?

You’ve got to draw a line somewhere,
and you might as well do it where most

practitioners of the faith you’re suppos-
edly disenfranchising actually agree with
you. Sixty-three percent of Catholics sup-
port insurance coverage for birth control,
according to the San Francisco Chronicle,
and 98 percent of Catholic women have
used birth control at some point in their
lives, according to the Guttmacher Insti-
tute. Just because the United States Con-
ference of -Catholic Bishops chooses to
neglect the healthcare needs of its own
parishioners doesn’t mean the govern-
ment’s moral obligation is to neglect them
as well. I

1. Cooking Mason Jar: If you are cook-
ing for friends, try presenting the food in
a Mason jar with a wide opening. For ex-
ample, fill the jar with chili and rest a piece
of cornbread on top. Or consider making
nifty make-your-own—food gifts: Put the
dry ingredients for cookies or cocoa in the
jar and add a handy instruction tag.

3. Salad Jar Mason Jar: For days when
you know you don’t have time to make it
home for lunch or dinner and have had
one too many soggy PB&Js, try this trick.
Fill the bottom of the Mason jar with gen-

erous amount of salad dressing, then start .~

layering the veggies and leave the greens
to rest on top. When you are readyto eat,
just dump out everything on to a plate
and enjoy a fresh Mason jar salad.

Good for more than jam;
think cooking and crafts

WRITTEN BY KIRSTIN KENNEDY I STAFF WRITER
PHOTOS BY STEVEN GARFINKEL j ASSISTANT VISUAL EDITOR

_ If Pintérest has taught us anything, it’s that using Mason jars to store jam is totally out
of fashion. .
But seriously, it’s now en vogue to use Mason jars to create nifty and useful household

items. It’s time to acknowledge that using these clear containers is the cool thing to do,

and get innovative with them. Sizes vary, and you can usually buy packs of 12 for under

$15, so it’s cheap too. Here is a list of things to try:

4. Message Mason Jar: If you are plan-
ning a going-away or graduation party,
the message Mason jar can act as a sign-
in sheet for guests. Have everyone write
a note on a ‘scrap of paper that they put
it in the jar. Afterward, you can carry their
messages with.you wherever you go. You
can even decorate the interior with pic-
tures to make a more personal memento.

 

5. Food Processing Mason Jar: If you
unscrew a normal blender container from
the blade and plastic bottom, you can
screw a Mason jar on to create a small,
convenient food processor. This means
you can make dips, smoothies, etc., that
you can eat-or drink straight from the jar
— just make sure you have the properly
sized mouth on the jars. V

  

2. Happy Candle Mason Jar: Fill the jar
with sand or water and_ let a candle float
inside. You can also decorate the top with
some rustic-looking twine to add a little
shabby-chic touch to your decoration.

6. Sun Tea Mason Jar: On a sunny day,
fill a clear Mason jar with water and about
four tea bags. Let it sit in the sun for three
to five hours. The tea will diffuse and fla-
vor the water. Any jar or clear pitcher will
do — the real trick is finding five hours’
worth of sunshine in Pittsburgh.

‘Wanderlust’ strays off path of  

tireclcomeclic conventions .

’ Byjeff Ihaza
Staff Writer

David Wain’s- style of comedy deﬁnitely‘

isn’t for everyone. The director best known
for the hit “Role Models” has his roots with
the offbeat comedy troupe Stella, whose

‘hyper-absurdist sketches were at times

polarizing among viewers. His latest cin-
ematic project “Wanderlust” walks the line
between the accessibility of “Role Models”
and the absurdly offbeat humor of his past
projects. ' .
The ﬁlm begins with a wealthy youn

couple purchasing a property in the West
Village of New York City. The husband,
George (Paul Rudd), is neurotic and sar-
castic, while his wife Linda (Jennifer Anis-

ton) is a free spirit with no set career path. '
When George loses his Wall Street job as a ,
result of the economic crisis, the couple is

forced to move in with George’s brother in
Atlanta. Before the couple can make it to
the city, they ﬁnd themselves in Elysium,
a living community full of nudists and hip-
pies. The plot thickens when the free-love
aspect of the Elysium community threatens
George and Linda’s marriage. Matters are
only made worse when the camp’s leader,
Seth, takes a particular interest in Linda.
Rudd plays his trademark sarcastic,
slightly pretentious but lovable charac-

fer Aniston

ter perfectly, making for some hilarious
dialogue between George and the Elysium
camp members. Aniston’s performance,
however, was lukewarm, providing for
some laughs but an overall forgettable
character. r _ ‘
.Unlike many recent comedies, “Wan-
derlust” delves into the absurd without
forcing viewers to disregardplot structure
and coherence. _The ﬁlm’s laughs come
from some well—timed jokes, like George’s
pre-sex pep talk and good old-fashioned
situational ir\ony. There are, of course, in-
stances when Wain’s affinity for the absurd
makes for some awkwardly unfunny mo-
ments. When George’s character attempts
to use the bathroom in the doorless Ely-
sium cainp, he is interrupted by various
members, making. for a joke that simply
doesn’t land but continues to try.
“Wanderlust” continues a tradition
of well-written and smart comedies that

break the monotony of overdone comedic ’

tactics of the past.

Sleigh Bells gets noisy with new album

By Patrick Wagner
S_taﬁ'Wri ter

Displaying a pair of white canvas ten-

nis shoes covered in blood, the cover of '

Sleigh Bells’ new album is representative
of the group’s continuing mission to drape
catchy pop melodies in the curtains of any-
thing noisy androck.

“True Shred Guitar” opens with the
anticipation of a live audience as vocalist

E Alexis Krauss ramps the crowd up and the

instrumentals slam out tasty power chords
like candy at a parade. When the song ac-
tually starts and Krauss yells, “Push it /
push it / true shred guitar,” there’s a sense
of wonderful anarchy as her warm vocals
hit Miller’s starkly metallic guitar.

“Born to Lose” stacks melodies on top
of. each other, and the duo’s instruments
seem to blend into a single musical whip.
“Heard you say suicide in your sleep /
just get on with it, you were born to lose”
Krauss sings, indicating a certain melan-
choly present throughout the song.

Backed by mechanical drum machines,
the midtempo song revolves around gui-

tars that shift between a distorted, syn-

Reign of Terror,
_ Sleigh Bells
Mom+Pop/Sony

Rocks like: Yeah Yeah Yeahs,
The Jesus and ‘Mary Chain,
‘ Crystal Castles '

Grade: B+

thesized lead and jangly chords dreamy
enough for a Beach Boys song.

The style varies from full-on sonic as-
saults by Derek Edward .Miller’s guitar
to more melodic sections dominated by
Krauss’ vocals. Sleigh Bells’ greatest vic-
tory derives from a synthesis of those two
elements. ~

While most of the tracks sting in a good

. way, “Comeback Kid” and afew other songs

occasionally: verge into areas of noisy ab-
straction that are hard to maneuver.
Though it does_n’t contain a song as in:

stantly memorable as “Rill Rill,” Reign of
Terror is a strong sophomore release that
reminds us that noise can be music too.‘ A

Roof diving and a gnome full of ecstasy

, only begin to describe the events that un-

fold in “Project X.”

Director N ima Nourizadeh’s ﬁlm de-
but and party movie, “Project X,” is the
quintessential example of what happens
when a movie pushes every boundary in an
attempt to create something shocking —
and it tries way too hard.

High school seniors Thomas, Costa and
JB live in a cloud of unwanted anonym-
ity. They decide to throw a party they call
“Project X” to boost their popularity on
their high school campus, using Thomas’
birthday as an excuse. They plan on trans-
forming into “large—sca1e ballers” by the
end of the night, not expecting the insan-
ity that will ensue.

-Dax, the group’s fourth and virtually
unknown member, ﬁlms the entire event.
He follows the three boys from start to ﬁn-
ish as they wreak havoc on the community,
causing anarchy in the suburban Pasadena
neighborhood. ‘ ‘

The party begins as most do: dead, with
too much liquorand not enough people.
But as the night continues, more students,
strangers and even parents ﬂock to Thom-

as’ house to celebrate his birthday, creat-
ing a string of events that quickly spiral
out of control. .

As the evening progresses, the three
losers turn into amateur rock stars. They
shotgun beer, have a naked pool party and

roll on stolen ecstasy, and each of the'pre- _

viously unknown students fulﬁlls his goal
of hooking up with at least one girl each.

Unlike most high school and even col-
lege parties, the night ends in complete
destruction. The horrifyingly dramatic
explosion of the night takes away from any
sort of realistic material “Project X”. may
have. ~

The creators of “Project X”. clearly
sought a reaction from the ridiculous ma-
terial that was featured in the movie, and

A a reaction is what they received. Audi-

ence members laughed relentlessly amidst
gasps of shock and disbelief from the out-
rageous stunts and scenes.

CH

But the obscene behavior is not neces-
sarily humorous. Overwrought at times
with unclear and inexplicable situations,
“Project X” seemed forced. It’s as if after
the writers ﬁnished the script, they re-
turned and added written steroids to every
believable moment.

A cracked—out mash between “The
Hangover” and “Superbad,” “Project X”
has all of the insanity of “The Hangover”
without the witty script of “Superbad.”
There are no quick jabs or cultural refer-
ences that could turn this mindless, teen-
age drinking movie into something more
entertaining.

“Project X” crosses into unrealistic ter-
ritory with its plot and transforms the fun-

. ny moments into something disturbing. In
order to give audiences some sort of Holly-_ .

wood normalcy, the writers include a trite
drama between Thomas, the birthday boy,
and the girl next door. ,

It does have an exceptional soundtrack,
and though no one would desire the ﬁnal
result of the party, viewers might want to
download the music that accompanied it.
Well—placed at climactic moments, the mu-
sic fueled the movie.

It’s not the best representation of ahigh
school party, but “Project X” does offer its
audience one beneﬁt: It will leave its view-
ers in search of a wild night.

  like its protagonists, ‘Project X’ tries too hard to get attention

Bob Dylan c

By Caily Grube
WPTS Contributor

I’m kind of ashamed to say this: I hate Bob
Dylan.

Rather, it’s not Dylan I hate, but his preva- ~

lence. Let me explain. As a child, all signs
pointed toward Dylan fandom. I was inter-
ested in 1960s—’7os pop bands like The Zom-
bies, The Hollies and The Byrds. I was rather
interested in early country from The Carter
Family and Hank Williams ‘Sr. I attempted
to read beat poets. All of this made it seem
obvious that I would like Dylan.

But when I ﬁrst listened to The Freewhee-
lin’ Bob Dylan and Highway 61 Revisited, I

couldn’t jive with his highly esteemed records.

It felt as if I had heard all of those songs before.

_ I found no intimate connection with the re-

cord. His songs were so available already.

I initially shrugged off my distaste, thinking
my opportunity to appreciate the intricacies
of Dylan had yet to come. Maybe it was taste

_ one acquires through age — like learning to
enjoy onions or Bjork. But I’ve been patiently .

waiting for more than 12 years to dig Dylan,
and it seems that my distaste is only getting
stronger. And last year’s Christmas record
didn’t help his case. _-
Still, it isn’t logical. Dylan has most quali-
ties in a musician that I value. He has relevant
lyrics. He was.a prominent voice of genera-
‘tion’s subculture. He follows in the tradition of
Harry Smith’s Anthology ofAmerican Folk Mu-
sic by reclaiming a homespun folk tradition.

He inﬂuenced aesthetics that arguably led to _

crucial D.I.Y. American punk movements.
But at the end of the day, I still get the wil-
lies when I hear Bob Dylan in a movie sound-
track or while scanning Pittsburgh’s radio
waves. '
Lately, I’ve tried to pinpoint my distaste for
Dylan. I’ve realized that it’s not really about

an’ t woo DI
him or his music.

John Berger’s “Ways of Seeing” helps me
understand that my disagreement lies in the
industry of Bob Dylan. Berger’s inﬂuential
essay discusses the effects of mass reproduc-
tion and consumption of visual images of art
on the object art itself. With the accessibility
to art in modern times, “images of arthave
become ephemeral, ubiquitous, insubstantial,
available, valueless, free.”

While Berger is-talking about images and
physical pieces of art, his critique voices ex-
actly how I feel about Bob Dylan’s music. It
is the redundancy of Bob Dylan that I hate.

» He is on par with a Che Guevara T-shirt in

Walmart. ,
Throughout my entire life, I have been

bludgeoned with the idea of Bob Dylan. Here ’

is Bob Dylan in the audio bed of a laundry

» detergent commercial. Here is Bob Dylan in

a crappy romantic movie scene. Here is an
entire aisle full of Bob Dylan merchandise in
Hot Topic. And here are the halls of your high
school, full of tie-dyed shirts screen-printed
with the face of Bob Dylan in sunglasses. All
of these things have made Bob Dylan a totally
availableexcess and valueless reproductionof
art. His aura is gone to me. »

And I don’t blame Dylan. I realize that I
sympathize with him, as he constantly avoided
the role of celebrity and became a recluse from
his own stardom. ‘ _ _ _

I don’t hate the actual living Bob Dylan/
Robert Zimmerman. I hate the capitalist cul-
ture that makes art a commodity and sucks
out its entire intrigue in the process. What is
left of Dylan is the association with the thing
I hate the most -— a commercial product de-
signed to be sold.

I’m not totally giving up on the possibility
of liking Dylan one day. Realizing these sym-
pathies isa good place to start. And maybe
it’s enough that I’ll give those early records
another chance’. i

MEN'S BASKETBALL

Panthers win big during last home game 1‘ season I

» By Lauren Kirschman
Sports Editor

With just one game left in the regu-
lar season, the Pitt men’s basketball
team is ﬁnally learning patience.
The Panthers — who failed to
reach 40 percent shooting from the

ﬁeld during their ﬁve-game losing .

streak — cruised to an 89-69 vic-
tory at the Petersen Events Center
on Wednesday night by passing the
ball well and waiting for open looks
against St. john’s match-up zone.

Pitt head coach Jamie Dixon at-
tributed the team’s improved shoot-
ing percentage to that improved
shot selection. -

. “I think it’s patience is what V

we’ve been preaching, and I thought
we showed patience in our last game
against Louisville,” Dixon said. “I
think we were making the simple
pass — the right pass — more times
tonight. We put ourselves in a posi-
tion to win.” -

Pitt senior Ashton Gibbs broke
out of his scoring slump in his ﬁnal
home game, scoring 19 points on
7-18 shooting, including 3-8 from
the 3-point line. He hadn’t made a
3-point shot in the»Panthers’ last
three games. ‘

“I think he did less off the dribble V

and just caught and shot which is
something we’ve been emphasiz-
ing with him,” Dixon said. “Ourvball
movement was good, our half—court
offense was very good.”

Gibbs was one of four Panthers
to reach double ﬁgures, including

center Dante Taylor who scored a,

career-high 17 points and grabbed
eight rebounds. He said his aggres-
sive inside carried over from Pitt’s

loss to Louisville.

Sophomore].j. Moore provided
an offensive spark when the Pan-
thers struggled to score in their last
three contests. He reached double
ﬁgures for the fourth consecutive
game with 14 points against St.
Johns and shot 3-6 from the ﬁeld,
including 3-4 from beyond the arc.

“It starts with my teammates,”
Moore said. “I feed off of them. They
told me to keep shooting  so that’s
what I’m doing right now. I’m in the
gym more working on my shot and

- my teammates all have conﬁdence

in me and I have conﬁdence in my
shot.”

Redshirt sophomore Lamar Pat-
terson added 13 points. Dixon said
he believes the Panthers are play-
ing the best basketball they have all
season. topping their performances
during a four-game winning streak
that brought wins over Providence,

Georgetown, West Virginia and Vil-

lanova.

Dixon added that he thought the
team played well in its 57-54 loss at
Louisville on Sunday.

Senior Nasir Robinson — who
also played his ﬁnal game at the
Petersen Events Center —- said Pitt
got off to a good start in building
momentum for the Big East tourna-
ment that starts Tuesday.

But Gibbs stressed that the Pan-
thers will focus on their regular-sea-
son game against Connecticut on
Saturday before turning their atten-
tion to the conference tournament
at Madison Square Garden.

“We got to do a better job of just
being consistent,” Gibbs added. “I
thinkwe had a great week in practice
and it carried over.”

After shooting 58.3 percent in

the ﬁrst half, the Panthers stayed hot
after halftime, improving to 68 per-
cent and coming out of the break on
a 16-5 run to build a 54-39 lead. Pitt

went 6-6 from the ﬁeld through the A

ﬁrst six minutes of the second half
before Patterson missed a layup.

St. John’s went on a 9--0 run
midway through the second half
to trim the 70-48 Pitt advantage
to 13 points, but the Panthers re-
sponded by pushing the lead back
to 20 points, 84-64, with 3:16 left
in the game.

i Pitt outscored St.John’s 51-36 in
the second half and Dixon said the
Panthers played good defense even
though St. john’s shot 50 percent
from the ﬁeld for the game.

“I think we’re defending bet-
ter,” Dixon said. “I thought we de-
fended well today, they made tough
shots.” g

Patterson hit a 3—pointer with
8.2 seconds left in the ﬁrst half to
put Pitt ahead 38-33 going into the
break. Pitt outrebounded the Red
Storm 31-17 in the‘ game, including
14-9 in the ﬁrst half.

“I thought in many ways, going
into halftime, given what Pitt had
done to us, we were lucky to be in
the game with the disparity on the
glass,” St.John assistant coach Mike
Dunlap said.

D’Angelo Harrison led St. John’s
with 21 points, while Phil Greene
and God’s Gift Achiuwa added 18
and 17 points, respectively. Fresh-
man Moe Harkless was held to a
season-low four points. Dixon
said the team Wanted to play well
for Gibbs, Robinson and Walk-on
Nick Rivers, who also played his
ﬁnal home game. Rivers scored on
a free throw with 25 seconds left in

Panthers head to Clarion for EWL Championships

L By Dustin Gabler
Stajfwriter

The Pitt’ Panthers will head. to
Clarion University for the Eastern

. Wrestling League Championship

this Sunday to defend last year’s
tournament title. 6
Based on the qualifying

allocations and current standings ‘

in the EWL — which is how many
wrestlers advance from each

weight class in the conference
— the Panthers can expect to
grab seven automatic bids to the

NCAA tournament, which starts ’

March 15.

Seven automatic bids is a goal
for the Panthers, who ﬁnished
ranked No. 9 following the
duals season. Head coach Rande
Stottlemyer’s team sent eight
wrestlers to nationals last year,
including one at—large bid.

But the team isn’t focusing on

who should and shouldn’t make
the tournament. All of that is just
a distraction. .

“I try to_ stay away from the
rankings and all the talk on the
internet,” junior No. 15 Anthony
Zanetta said. “It’s not going to
help me win.” .

Zanetta, the 125-pounder for
Pitt, has been the top-ranked
player in his weight class all
season in the EWL. He’s a favorite
to win the weight class, and even

a runner-up ﬁnish will send him
to nationals. If he were to ﬁnish
outside of the top two, he would
also have a chance at ‘ being
selected as an at—large wrestler.

Despiteknowingtheallocation
number for his class, No.
19—_ranked sophomore Shelton
Mack prefers to focus on matches
individually.

“I just like to focus on
winning,” Mack said. “Taking it
one match at a time, just like the

regular season, takes off a lot of
the pressure. It makes it easier to
wrestle.”

The 133-pound sophomore’s
weight class will send three

WRESTLING

FROM PAGE ll

defeated the Edinboro wrestler 3-2 in
the dual match and lost to him 1-0 in the
Buffalo Open.

Mack knows that a potential third
meeting with Schopp will be the most
meaningful due to the high—pressure
situation, but he and his team are ready for
the tournament.

“The postseason is where everything
pays off,” Mack said. “The team is
prepared. It is something we all have been
working so hard for. The energy is great,
and everyone’s excited.”

Two wrestlers. from the 141-pound
weight class will advance to the national
tournament, and freshman Travis Shaffer
will be looking to earn a trip to the NCAA
tournament in his ﬁrst season.

At 149 pounds, senior No. 10 Tyler
Nauman is searching for his fourth
EWL title. With the dual season now
over, his focus has shifted to thatfourth
championship —. a chance at something
not often accomplished.

“I want a fourth title and am shooting
for it Sunday,” Nauman said. “I won’t be
satisﬁed if I don’t get it because I know
I can. There aren’t many people with
three, let alone four, individual EWL
championships.”

The pressure is still great for an
experienced wrestler like Nauman, and he
is avoiding all outside inﬂuences in advance
of his ﬁnal EWL tournament.

“The pressure is a difficult thing to deal
with,” Nauman said. “Different people deal
with pressure differently. I try to stay off
the forums and away from the rankings. I
just go out and wrestle my match.”

Nauman’s weight class will send two
from the EWL, and he should ﬁnish in the
top two. He would also have a good shot at
picking up an at—large bid should there be
an upset. 1

Donnie Tasser, who received an at-

large bid last season, will look to earn one
of the two automatic qualiﬁers and avoid
selection-day nerves.

Sophomore Tyler Wilps has his work cut
out for him at 165 pounds. The EWL was
only awarded one automatic qualiﬁer, and
C1arion’s No. 5 Bekzod Abdurakhmonov
will be a tough opponent.

Senior Ethan Headlee comes in as
the top—ranked wrestler for the EWL in
the 174—pound weight class. With three
wrestlers from the EWL awarded spots in
the NCAA tournament, Headlee should be
heading to St. Louis.

There will be some interesting bouts
at 184 pounds for senior Andy Vaughan,
who’s ranked third in the EWL. With three
spots up for grabs, ‘Vaughan is projected to
advance but will face tough competition
from other wrestlers looking to steal his
spot.

At 197 pounds, three spots are on the
line, and No. 4—ranked~ junior Matt Wilps
carries the best hopes of going to the NCAAS
for Pitt. It will be difficult for Wilps to win
the EWL tournament with the nation’s
second- ranked 197-pound wrestler Chris
Honeycutt from Edinboro.

Honeycutt defeated Wilps twice this
season, but the junior is just ignoring the
past and focusing on winning like the rest
of the team.

“There really is no way to avoid the
pressure other than trying to ignore it,”
Wilps said. “The allocations aren’t a factor.
I’ll just focus on winning.”

Heavyweight is the only class in which
the Panthers don’t have a top—four wrestler.
Freshman, Joel Yahner will need to pull
some upsets to wind up in the top three and
book a spot to the national tournament.

Pitt is ready for Sunday’s tournament in
Clarion. Zanetta feels that they just have to
embrace the challenge. They know when
it is time to wrestle — they’ve been on the
mats since October.

“The team is well prepared mentally
and physically,” Zanetta said. “Our team is
calm, cool and collected. We know when to
turn it on at the right time.” I"

‘l'ASSER’S TAKE

Winners and losers of the NHL trade deadline

By Donnie Tasser
A Staﬁ" Writer

The National Hockey League trade deadline
quietly came and passed this week, adding
a second consecutive slow year.

For the second year in a row, only 16
trades were completed, down from 31

, moves two years ago. There was a lot of

hype over where Columbus Bluejacket star
winger Rick Nash would end up, but the
Columbus management’s high demand for
him won over any potential suitor.
The Winner: Los Angeles Kings

The Kings acquired another legitimate
scoring threat in Jeff Carter. Carter, who
spent a thoroughly unproductive season
in Columbus, was reunited with former
teammate Mike Richards. Carter spent
his entire career with Richards on the
Philadelphia Flyers before this season.
These two have great chemistry and will
make the Kings — currently in a three-
way tie for the eighth and ﬁnal playoff spot
in the West — much stronger offensively
down the stretch run.
The Loser: Columbus Blue Jackets

The Bluejackets, far and away the worst
team in the league, were unable to move
their biggest asset, captain Rick Nash, in

I’

PRESENTS xxxsusimstia

an attempt to rebuild. It was revealed after
the deadline passed that the low—key Nash
had demanded a trade to a Cup contender,
which surprised many people. Now they
must wait until the offseason to trade their
disgruntled star, but his value has already
peaked. In the midst of another losing
season, playing in a city where he doesn’t
want to be with a poor supporting cast will
not make him any more productive. The
Jackets missed the boat and should
have taken the best possible deal
for him.
The Gambler: Nashville Predators

The Preds solidiﬁed their lineup and
made it clear that they are in this season
for the long haul. Sitting at ﬁfth place in the
West, they added mammoth defenseman
Hal Gill, winger Andrei Kostitsyn and face-
off specialist Paul Gaustad, giving up only
draft picks but big ones. They traded a 2012
ﬁrst— and 2013 fourth-rounder for Gaustad
and a 2013 second-rounder for Kostitsyn.
They acquired Gill last week in a move that
also involved draft picks. They ﬁlled all
of their holes without giving up anything
in terms of personnel. But if these moves
don’t pan out for them, they certainly won’t
be rebuilding through the draft.
The Silent One: Pittsburgh Penguins

Ray Shero’s six—year career, e
didn’t make a move at the deadline. And you

playing spectacular hockey at the moment,
