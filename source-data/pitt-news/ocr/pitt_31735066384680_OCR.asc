Pro-WPIC Strikers, Campus Police Clash During Protest

$Disruption of

Strike Talks
A Is Doubted

By DAN ROSENTHAL

Pitt News Staff Wriiei

Negotiations in the 55~day—old
strike by workers at Western
Psychiatric Institute and Clinic
(WPIC) remain “non-productive”
and should not be adversely
effected by Monday’s sit-in by
strike supporters in Chancellor
Posvar’s ofﬁce, according to the
union’s chief negotiator.

Q “I don’t think the demonstration

had anything to do with negotia-
tions,” said Jack Hustwit, chief
negotiator for district 1199-P of the
National Union of Hospital and
Health Care Employees, AFL-CIO,
“but rather the University’s
consistent refusal to talk seriously
about the issues.”

Some 20 strike sympathizers,
claiming to represent civic, re-
ligious and professional organiza-
tions, held a seven-hour sit-in in
Chancelor Posvar’s ofﬁce Monday,

then moved upstairs to the 36th \

floor of the Cathedral of Learning

U nd waited to talk to the Chancellor
I . llowing a Senate Council meeting.

Posvar refused to talk to the
demonstrators.

Chancellor Is Restrained

From Leaving Cathedral

By RICH HARRY

Pitt News Staff Writer

Also contributing to this story were Pitt News staff writers
Rodney B. Griffith, Tom M. K ukucka and Bob Labriola.

Some 20 strike supporters clashed with Campus
Police outside a Cathedral of Learning elevator
Monday after the group was denied a meeting with
Chancellor Posvar to demand an end to a 55-day old
walkout by striking employees at Western Psychiatric
Institute and Clinic .(WPIC).

The confrontation with about a half dozen security
guards culminated a seven-hour wait by the coalition
outside the Chancellor’s ofﬁce and a subsequent
encounter with Posvar on the Cathedral’s thrity-sixth
ﬂoor where he was physically restrained from leaving
by the protesters.

The “strike support committee” was the same one
denied talks with Posvar March 29 on the grounds that
such a discussion would hamper negotiations in the
strike by some 120 members of the National Union of
Hospital and Health Care Employees Local 1199P.

Committee members are claiming that patient care
at the hospital has deteriorated since the walkout’s
onset Feb. 17 and are pressing the Chancellor to
personally end it.

Monday’s sit-in began at 9:30 a.m. when the group, I

including several Pittsburgh service and religious
groups, ﬁled into the Chancellor's small reception
area outside his ﬁrst ﬂoor Cathedral ofﬁce and
demanded to talk with Posvar.

At the time, Posvar was in New Stanton to attend
ribbon-cutting ceremonies at a new Volkswagen plant

can’t hurt them any,” Sam McGill,
a union delegate said yesterday.
“The bargaining sessions have
been one political mess. It’s
obvious Pitt is out to bust this
union.”

Two days of talks were held
March 30 and 31, and both sides
say little was accomplished.

“University negotiators did offer

us a compromise on some of the
n-economic issues,” Hustwit
 “But they still aren’t talking
wages. When you’re almost eight
weeks into a strike,,you’ve got to
talk (in terms of) packages and they
aren’t talking packages.”
Issues still on the negotiating
table are, according to the union:
-—A wage and beneﬁts package;
-—A demand that subcontracted

Carlow Dormitory Space Consider

By PATTY TASCARELLA
Pitt News Staff Wrifer '

A decision as to whether female
Pitt students will stay at Carlow
College’s dormitories this Fall
should be reached by the end of this
week, according to housing director
Don Hughes.

“We have no agreement from
Carlow at this date,” Hughes said
Tuesday.

Carlow has picked up some of
Pitt's oyerﬂow in past years. The
Housing Ofﬁce mailed out ques:
tionnaires during the past two

weeks to female students on the
waiting list to poll their opinions
regarding living at Carlow.
According to Hughes, the response
has been “fairly negative.”

If Pitt students are sent to
Carlow, they will be living under
Carlow’s dormitory regulations, not
Pitt’s. The students would be under
contract to stay at Carlow for two
terms, although last year, “around
half a dozen” Pitt students “with a
valid case for coming back” were
able to move back to the
University’s residence halls when
space became available. Transfer

gstudentstook over the rooms at

Carlow, according to Hughes.

The Fall housing situation does
not seem so bleak as it once did.
During room drawings, 100 persons
were added to the 2,300 allotment to
bid for rooms. The number comes
from an estimation of the usual
number of students who either drop
out or find an apartment during the
summer. '

“That’s a gamble, of course, on
the part of the housing office,”
Hughes said.

.. enate Council ‘Hearst Prof's Pro-Strike Pleas

By SUE McFARLAND
Pitt News Siaffwriter

Members of the University Senate Council
carried on the routine proceedings of their
- monthly meeting Wednesday while a group of
sympathizers of striking workers at the
Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic waited
outside the meeting for Chancellor Posvar who
had on several occasions refused an audience

with the group to discuss the strike.

The strike was discussed briefly once during
two-and-a-half hour meeting. Dr. David
oustin, a professor in Pitt’s department of
economics. entered his plea for the 123 striking
workers, who he cited as being “very low and
underpaid employees.” Houston also spoke,

‘ ‘I stop and contemplate what the health care
is really like when the institution is fully staffed
and ﬁnd it easy to find serious fault, ” Houston
said. “And now that these people have been
taken away I ﬁnd it not hard to see how health
care will deteriorate.”

Assistant Vice Chancellor of I the health
professions, Edison Montgomery responded
by saying that the Pennsylvania Department of
Health and Medicare, the Pennsylvania
Department of Public Welfare and the
Allegheny County Mental Health/ Mental
Retardation Program had inspected the facility
and found no reduction in the level of patient
care.

“On the subject of wages and beneﬁtskl

but we are not dealing with underpaid
people, ” Montgomery added.

In other business, the Chancellor delivered
his monthly report airing information about the
University’s move to urge the State Senate
Appropriations Committee to grant Pitt an
additional $10.5 million for the 1978-79 ﬁscal
year.

“The outcome as of yet is uncertain, but the
public’s sympathy to the University could lead
to a favorable outcome. The results of the May
primary elections also will play a major role,”
Posvar said.

The Chancellor reported there is currently a
proposal on the floor of the legislature to make
Pennsylvania's state-related universities a
part of the general budget rather than the

Monday’s demonstration by some 20 representativesiof
neighborhood groups sympathetic to the current WPIC
strike was not the first protest organized on Pitt’s campus
since Wesley Posvar became chancellor in 1968, but it was
the first demonstration which ended in physical force
between campus police and protestors.

“lt was utterly deplorable,” said Executive Assistant to
the Chancellor Edward Brozik. “It was -a direct
contradiction of what the University is about.”

The protest marked the third time since 1970 that a group
has demonstrated in the chancellor’s office.

On October 22, 1974, 100 Black Action Society (BAS)
members gained control of the ofﬁce, disputing the
appointment of Carnegie-Mellon professor Roland Smith as
head of the black studies department over Pitt professor
Curtiss Porter. The chancellor was in New York at the time

but the demonstrators dispersed that night when a meeting
was set up with ﬁAS dean Jerome Rosenberg.

On March 23 of last year, 66 student sympathizers of
"assistant professors Paul Nyden and Yussef Ali gathered in
the outer offices of Posvar and Rosenberg. They were
protesting the University’s refusal to grant tenure to either
teacher. Posvar and Rosenberg were at a meeting in
Monroeville at the time and a court injunction forced the
removal of the students.

Pitt had it’s share of protests in the late 1960’s. The
largest was held on March 11, 1969, when some 900
students and faculty gathered in the Cathedral Commons
Room to advocate a “free University” in which “structure
and communication” would improve. The demonstration
turned into a massive teach-in with student and faculty
speakers. A‘ court injunction closed the Cathedral at 4:30
a.m. with no violence or arrests.

On January 15, 1969, 70 members of the BAS gathered in
the chancellors ante-room to demand more rights for blacks
at Pitt.

Student Government Board member Bernie

fferent From Past Protests

“The students were respectful and orderly,” Posvar said
after meeting with them for 30 minutes that afternoon.

Monday’s demonstration began as a peaceful and orderly
request to meet with Posvar who instead attended an
opening day ceremony at the new Volkswagen plant in New
Stanton.

When he returned to campus to attend a Senate Council
meeting in the Babcock Room on the 40th ﬂoor of the
Cathedral, the protestors were waiting on the 36th when it
was over.

It marked “the first time physical violence has ever been
used on a University administrator,” according to Brozik.

There were indications that more action by the strike’““;,,

sympathizers may be taken against Posvar in the future.

Brozik has stated that “approporiate precautions” have
been taken.
“We are going to continue to operate as normal,’ ’ he said.

non-preferred status they are currently under.
The report of the Senate Budget and policies
Committee presented a shortened version of
the acceptance and endorsement of its prior
statement concerning two- and three-term
faculty appointments by the Faculty Assembly.
The presentation by committee chairman
Richard Pratt encompassed three points
outlined by the original committee report.

The assembly endorsed the view that for
future appointments, regardless of whether
three term appointments are offered, tenure

and that for present three-term appointments
where a reduction to two terms is desired, the
move can only be made with the mutual
consent of all parties involved.

The third and ﬁnal point of the faculty
endorsement was that which concerned
appointments in the academic administration,
which can be terminated at any time. The
Assembly believed these appointments should
be made for a particular period of time and
should then be subject to evaluation before
renewal.

‘ ‘I can foresee this resolution coming back to
us for approval very soon,” said Senate
president Hibberd Kline.

Popko reported on work by student members of
the Senate Council since the last meeting,
introducing the Pitt Union Program Council, a
body working with the Office of Student
Activities and the School of General Studies
Cabinet.

“This is the first time Pitt will have a
collective programming system,” Popko said,
adding that student government would be
sponsoring a campus-wide drive during Spring
term to push the University’s policy on energy
conservation. The drive will feature a slogan
and poster contest open to all students.

Student activists in Mexico are being silenced by their
government, according to a former Mexican college student
who stopped at Pitt last week during his national tour for
political asylum.

Hector Marroquin Manriquez, a student leader at the
University of Nuevo Leon in Monterrey in 1974, says he was
forced to ﬂee from Mexico after being “framed on charges I
couldn’t have committed.”

Manriquez told a small gathering here that some students
who speak out against the Mexican government are
violently repressed.

“Two students with me, who were affiliated with the
socialist party, were charged with resisting arrest and were
killed,” he said.

Manriquez said he also was accused of being “involved.”

Wednesday, April 12, 1978-—‘THE PITT NEWS—Page 3

Mexican Government Repressive, Activist Charges

“I fear the same thing that happened to them will happen
to me ifl return,” he added.

Consequently, he has started a campaign, supported by
Americans, to help, as he says, “raise consciousness about
the practices of the Mexican government.”

He said he is also requesting public support for his
personal plea for asylum in this country, which “would be a
victory for thousands of political activists.” Thus far, the
U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service has denied the
request. —

Last year, after being arrested in Houston for not having
proper documents, bail for his release was set at $10,000.

According to Manriquez, who continues to reside inthe
United States as an illegal alien, the bail figure is five times
the normal fee. ,

“That shows some kind of pressure,” he said.

He said he believes political ties and multinational

interests are outweighing U.S. concern for human rights in
Mexico.

John Beverley, associate professor of hispanic languages
at Pitt, agreed.

“There are moral ramifications here,” declared
Beverley, a member of the faculty panel speaking on behalf
of Manriquez.

“Cuban activists and exiles from eastern europe are .
being given asylum while people from the non-communist
countries are denied,” he said.

Pitt law professor, Thomas M. Cooley, a former member
of the U.S. Board of Immigration Appeals told the group the
only course is to “wait and see” if Manriquez is granted
asylum.

“The board has to decide ‘Is this man really going to be
subject to persecution when he returns?’ ” Cooley said.

(Continued from Page 1)

Later in the afternoon, a meeting was scheduled
between the group and Assistant Vice Chancellor for
the health professions Edison Montgomery, who was
to explain the University’s position regarding the
negotiations. The coalition, however, opted to
remain. They sent instead several persons not
formally belonging to their group.

The Chancellor arrived here sometime around 3:00
for a scheduled University Senate Council meeting.
The coalition, meanwhile, moved to the Cathedral’s
thirty-sixth ﬂoor, where they later confronted the
Chancellor, Campus Police and several admini-
strators who were leaving the meeting.

Several members of the coalition effectively blocked
the Chancellor's way to the evevators by wedging
themselves into the narrow passageway. Posvar’s
attempts to walk through the crowd were aborted as

» members held him back.

It was considered by some Pitt administrators to be
the first time on campus that physical force was
exerted on a University administrator.

“You are interfering with the normal operations of
the University,” Posvar told the protestors at one

Strike Protestors Confront Posvar, Pitt Police

point. “There’s nothing more to discuss. You
have used force.”

Visibly angry, the group continued to demand a
statement. Posvar, whose comments at times were
shouted down by the protestors, responded that
inspections by every licensing bureau of WPIC have
yielded no substantiation to the group’s charge of
deteriorating conditions. He also reiterated the
University’s official stand that it not interfere with the
collective bargaining process.

Posvar subsequently broke away from the group.
Campus Police Chief Curt Graham then read a court
order issued by Common Pleas Judge John P.
Flaherty that directed Pitt police to physically remove
protestors failing to comply.

Coalition members, however, maintained their
positions on the ﬂoor and continued to do so until they
learned Posvar exited the corridors via an alternative
route.

They remained on the ﬂoor for several minutes and
offered to the remaining crowd emotional
statements-—some peppered with profanity-—in
support of the strikers. “There are families of the
strikers who don’t have food on the table, ” one person
yelled. “The way you’ve dealt with this union

stinks.”

The group then boarded an elevator and headed for
what was to be their second encounter with the
Chancellor.

After arriving on the Cathedral’s first ﬂoor, the
protestors disembarked and moments later discover-
ed a nearby elevator contained the Chancellor and
security guards. The group rushed the elevators and
blocked the doors, but were restrained by police who
wrestled with several protestors. ,

One protestor suffered a cut finger. There were no
arrests. .

The crowd, which grew to several dozens,
eventually dispersed and the Chancellor was escorted .
from the scene.

Several protestors indicated they would continue to
pressure the Chancellor to end the strike (‘‘It will
happen every day until the walkout ends,” one
Coalition member said), but there’ were no incidents
reported yesterday.

University spokeswoman Mary Ann Aug said
yesterday there was speculation as to whether the
pro-strike group included members of the University,
but two members acknowledged to a Pitt News
reporter Monday that they were Pitt students.

Confrontation

It was the Keystone Cops, absurdist theater and 1978-style social
relevance all rolled into one.

Chancellor Posvar attempted to walk over demonstrators
blocking his path on the 36th floor of the Cathedral Monday after-
noon, before running down several ﬂights of stairs to escape them.
Later, security guards dragged the protestors from between
elevator doors on the first floor so Posvar could continue to the
basement and flee.

This confrontation was the avoidable culmination of a long
series of events. For weeks, supporters of Western Psychiatric In-
stitute and Clinic strikers have sought an audience with the Chan-
cellor, and he has steadfastly ignored their requests.

Three and a half weeks ago, the strike support group—a
coalition of 25 Pittsburgh neighborhood organizations, including
the Association of Pittsburgh Priests, Pittsburgh Neighborhood
Alliance, South Oakland Citizens Council, People’s Oakland and
the North Side Commission for Human Resources—sent a
telegram to Posvar, asking to meet with him about the slow
progress of the strike. He never responded to that telegram, accor-
ding to James Ferlo, co—chairman of the strike support group.
Ferlo later called the Chancellor’s office, and was told that Posvar
had no intention of meeting with the coalition.

Twenty members of the strike support group visited Posvar’s of-
fice on March 29th, requesting to see the Chancellor. Dr. James
Hunter, an aide to Posvar, first denied the Chancellor was in his
office. Later, he admitted Posvar was in, but he said any dialogue
would not help negotiations.

After the Chancellor’s office had ignored them and attempted to
deceive them, the coalition resorted to more drastic action—Mon-
day’s sit-in. They sat for several hours in the waiting room outside
the Chancellor’s office, while Posvar was in New Stanton par-
ticipating in the ribbon-cutting ceremonies at Volkswagen’s new
facilities. After he returned for the regularly-scheduled Senate

‘Council meeting at three o’clock, the confrontation occured.

(Earlier in the afternoon, reporters for The Pitt News had been told
by a secretary that Posvar would be attending an [off-campus
meeting; in fact, the Senate Council meets in the Babcock Room on
the Cathedral’s 40th floor.)

While it is probably true that a meeting with the Chancellor
would have been unproductive (the strike is now being negotiated
under the direction of a state mediator), there is no good reason for
the treatment the strike support coalition has received from the
University. Ignoring and attempting to deceive community
organizations is not a good way to improve the University’s alreadv
poor standing with those groups. Posvar might have attempted
Monday to reverse the long-standing trend toward increased
University-community alienation, but he tried to choose the easy
way out instead.

One wonders whether a Golden Panther with a few bucks to con-
tribute to football recruitment would encounter such resistance
before being granted an audience.

All of this does not, of course, excuse the rather unheroic con-
duct of the protestors Monday. Their unruliness prevented Posvar
from making a statement when he was finally cornered. Frustration
notwithstanding, better behavior could have aided the strike sup-
porters’ cause.

But as members of the University community, the Chancellor’s
actions are what concern us most. The WPIC strike is dragging on,
bad feelings are building on each side, and the University is not
helping the situation. The Chancellor and all members of the ad-
ministration should make themselves as accessible as possible to
legitimate representatives of the local community who make
reasonable requests for a hearing. The strike supporters, in their
earlier attempts to see Posvar, were certainly in this category. What
we don’t need here is an unassailable, imperial Chancellorship.

Mexican Suppression of Rights

By TOM DYNIA

The hypocrisy of Jimmy Carter’s
so-called “human rights” cam-
paign—his “oversight” of viola-
tions of such rights from Iran to the
Philippines to the United States—is
widely known. However, another
example of such “oversight” which
has received little attention has
been that of Mexico. Through the
efforts of the Mexican and United
States’ Governments, Mexico has
managed for years to maintain a
democratic image in spite of its
widespread repression of political
parties and free speech, and in spite
of the arrest, torture and murder of
many of the opponents of the
present Government.

Mexico is a one-party “democ-
racy.” The Party of Revolutionary
Institutions (PR1) has ruled Mexico
since the ‘late . 1920’s. It is
exceedingly difficult for opposition
parties to get on the ballot, and they
are denied many of the resources
available to the PR1.

The Government also has a great
deal of control over the news media.
Radio and television are owned by
the state. The Government controls
the import of newsprint, so that it
can effectively shut down any paper
that raises its voice in opposition
without going through the messy
details of censorship that offend
believers in a free press.

No newspaper is immune to this
pressure. In 1976 the leading
Mexico City daily, Excelsior, made
a few less-than-complimentary
remarks about then-president
Echeverria. Echeverria threatened
to put the paper out of business and
forced the editor to resign.

It should come as no surprise that
the past decade has ,seen the
development of a number of

c movements of people angry over the

lack of democratic rights in Mexico.
The most active and visible sector of
the Mexican population in this
regard has been the students.

In 1968 a strong student
movement arose, demanding many
reforms, including the release of all
political prisoners. Since this was
the year that all the world was
supposed to see what a prosperous
and politically healthy country
Mexico was, through the vehicle of
the Mexico City Olympics, the
Government could ill-afford any
hint of dissent.

A peaceful march of 15,000
students and workers was ﬁred on

GUES TCOL UMN

by Government troops armed with
machine guns. Over 300 were killed
and hundreds more were wounded.

But this massacre did not crush
the movement for democratic
rights; if anything, such a brutal
display of force gained additional
supporters for the movement.
Within a year, Mexico’s campuses
were heavily politicized.

On many campuses students
raised the demand for an end to
Government control of education.
The University of Nuevo Leon in
Monterrey was the scene of
enormous protests over this issue.
Many students were jailed, but,
with sympathy actions on other
campuses. The Government was
forced to make some concessions.

Throughout this period, the
Mexican authorities carried on a
violent campaign against the
protests. Many persons marked as
“troublemakers” were either gun-
ned down or arrested. Those
arrested have seldom been heard
from again.

One recent victim of the
repression facing the Mexican
student movement is Hector

Marroquin. From 1969 until 1974

Marroquin was a leader of that;-1-
movement at the University of r‘ I

Nuevo Leon.

In 1974 when the Mexican
Government tried to silence him on
charges of terrorism and murder,
Marroquin ﬂed for his life. Several
months later he discovered he was
also wanted for a number of
robberies in Monterrey, all of which
were allegedly committed at a time
when Hector was living in the
United States.

Last fall, the United States
Government arrested Marroquin as
an “illegal alien” and is currently
carrying out deportation proceed-
ings against him.
successful, Hector’s fate is clear. Of
the four other students accused with
Marroquin of murder, two have
been gunned down by the police, a
third was tortured, and the fourth
“disappeared.” g

Marroquin’s supporters, de-
manding political‘ asylum for him
face stiff opposition from the Jimmy
“Human rights” Carter adminis-
tration. For the United States to
grant asylum to Marroquin would
be to admit that the Mexican
authorities violate human rights.
Furhermore, the Government of the
United States is just as determined
as that of Mexico to silence people
like Hector—trade unionists, -33*" 
dent activists and socialists. ’..‘-1”’

Only broad public support for
asylum can save the life of Hector
Marroquin. His case is a symbol not
only of the repression of the
Mexican government and the
hypocrisy of Carter, but of the real
movement for democratic rights in
Mexico and around the world.

negie-Mellon University, is a member of

B ’68 Democratic Convention Destroyer of FDR Coalition

By R. DAVID TIVE

Editor’s Note: This is the fourth in a
series of columns about the events of
1968, their impact at that time, and their
repercussions on America today.

Putting the Democratic Na-
tional Convention in Chicago in
August 1968 into some sort of
historical‘ perspective is not easy
for me to do. I was there. I saw
what happened; both in Convention
Hall and out in the streets. It was
one of the most formative
experiences of my life, and one I
am likely to never forget.

This column, however, is not
about my experiences in Chicago,
but about the impact of the
convention and the accompanying
riots on America in general.
Something happened in Chicago;
something that fundamentally
changed the nature‘ of American
politics and that has had spillover
into other aspects of our life.

As indicated above, the Chicago
convention existed on two levels,

1 inside Convention Hall and outside

in the streets of the city. The two
were interrelated but also existed
by themselves. Dealing with what
happened inside is probably the
logical place to start since it leads
logically to what happened outside.

What happened on the ﬂoor of
the convention was that the old
Democratic coalition, put together
by Franklin Roosevelt, fell apart
once again. The FDR coalition of
urban liberals, midwestern pro-
gressives, southern conservatives
and ethnic, racial and religious
minorities, had elected him to the

. presidency four times, and had

\

made the Democratic, Party the
majority party both in terms of
political power and voter registra-
tion. It did not, however, survive
him.

In 1948, the ﬁrst split became
evident when the Dixiecrats, led by

Letters .
Posvar Views

Strom Thurmond, walked out of the
Democratic Convention in Phila-
delphia in protest of a proposed
civil-rights plank for the party
platform. I

The gap widened throughout the
early 1950’s with the witch hunts of
Joseph McCarthy and the nomina-
tion of Adlai Stevenson for
President in 1952 and 1956. By the
end of that decade, the rupture
between the liberal and conserva-
tive wings of the party was almost
total.

The nomination and election of
John Kennedy in 1960 helped heal
the breach somewhat, but his
emphasis on civil rights kept the
north-south split alive. Lyndon
Johnson, who pictured himself as a
reincarnation of FDR, rode the
temporary ceaseﬁre and a wave of
popular sympathy over JFK’s
assassination to victory in 1964.
Between 1964 and 1968, however,
the Vietnam War reopened the
wounds. The debates on the
convention ﬂoor in Chicago showed
that the Democrats were closer to
being two parties than to being
one.

It is interesting to note that the
man who caused the split in 1968
was the same man who caused the
split in 1948--Hubert Humphrey.
His insistence, in 1948, on having a
strong civil rights platform for the
party drove out the conservatives.

His insistence, in 1968, on
having a strong pro-Vietnam War
platform drove out the liberals.
Although Humphrey emerged on
the “winning” side in both
conventions, it was those splits,
more than anything else, that kept
him from ever becoming President.

The split in the party is still with
us today. It was certainly evident in
1972 in the McGovern Disaster.
Jimmy Carter somehow imposed a
temporary ceaseﬁre in 1976 much in
the same way JFK did in 1960, but it

looks now as if the ﬁghting has
begun again. Carter, two years
from now, may be its first victim.
It was out in the streets of
Chicago, however, that the real
national trauma took place. An
investigating commission set up
after the convention called what
happened a “police riot.”
Whether riot is the right term is
open to question, but it was
certainly a case of those who were

causing the trouble being the same
ones who were entrusted with the
responsibility of keeping the peace.
They kept the peace by beating
everyone they could ﬁnd.

Throughout the late 1950’s and
early 1960’s there had been many
instances of police attacks upon
protestors trying to exercise their
rights as citizens.

But almost without exception
these occurances took place in the
south and the victims were almost
uniformly black. As such, the
events had little impact on the
conscience of America, which was,
and still is, primarily middle-class
white.

Chicago in August 1968 was the
ﬁrst time the police, the ‘protectors
of our middle-class society, attack-
ed members of that society. These
were not nameless black youths
being beaten; these were the sons
and daughters of people who
thought they were good Americans.
These were not “outsiders” trying
to disrupt the fabrie of American
society being arrested. These were
youths, politicians, businessmen-
men and women of substance and
leaders of their communities. (This
was brought home to me dramati-
cally when I spent most of the last
night of the convention trying to
raise bail for many New York and

Only the Best in McCormick

The following letter is in
reference to Chancellor Posvar’s
visit to the residence halls,
McCormick Hall in particular,

 Ch is slated for April 19. The

nature of this visit has been brought
to our attention at a recent dorm
council meeting.

Initially, the visit was to gain a
full insight into the predominant
conditions of the residence halls and

to get a feel of what might be done to
remedy any existing problems.
Through no fault of his own,
however, and because of the
preparations being made, the
Chancellor will see only two of 30
odd suites in McCormick Hall.
These suites, in near perfect
condition, are being readied for the
visit by unscheduled maid service to
give the Chancellor an even more

The Retirement of Larry Harris

Every three years marks a new

Saying goodbye to Larry is at
once an exciting, happy experience
and a deep bereavement. Of
course I wish him all the success in
pro basketball his predecessor,
Billy Knight, is experiencing, and I
know he will do well wherever he
goes. But at the same time, I can’t
help but be distraught over the fact
that no longer will I be treated to
the sweet jumpers, . the smooth
moves and the dazzling dunks.

Countless times he made the key

a hoop was needed to win the game
or send it into overtime. He thrived
on pressure and rarely failed when
under it.

One, even vaguely familiar with
the game of basketball could tell
the ﬁrst time Larry set foot on the
court as a freshman that he would
be a great one. Besides having the
perfect basketball body and great
leaping ability, he has the silky
court presence reminiscent of Elgin

exception and not the rule.
Chancellor Posvar will never see
those suites with unworkable or no
kitchen equipment or the tiles that
are raising off the ﬂoors or the

plaster that is falling off the walls '

and ceilings. Obviously, if these
problems are not apparent, nothing
can be done to alter the conditions.

Originally, the Chancellor was
scheduled to visit the suites that
need to have work done to them, but
somehow, as stated before, he was
rescheduled and will now only see
the two McCormick Hall suites that
are in exceptionally good condition.

Should the purpose of the visit to
McCormick Hall be to impress
Chancellor Posvar, or should it be to
impress upon him the needs of the
students living in the residence

Nothing like this had happened
before. Americans were ﬁghting
Americans in the streets of one of
our major cities. It was indeed a
national trauma. And it has not
gone away. An experience like that
raises questions.

In this case, it raised questions
about the nature of our social
institutions. Were they really doing
the job we wanted them to do? Had
they lost touch with the people of
this country? These are questions
we are still asking today, and many
of them are directly traceable to
Chicago 1968, where, for the ﬁrst
time, all the repressive weight of
our society was brought to bear on
members of the mainstream of that
society.

There is another legacy of the
Chicago convention. Up to that
point, the confrontations between
those groups seeking to change our
society and those trying to prevent
any change had been peaceful. All
that was abruptly altered.

The forces for change saw that
those opposing them were willing
to use violence and physical force

to stop them. The forces trying to.

prevent change saw that violence
could be used without any threat of
sanctions being taken against them
by the society they were protecting.

From this grew. a number of
things. Radical revolutionary

groups such as the Weathermen
were formed as a direct result of
the ﬁghting in Chicago. Not since
John Brown in the pre-Civil‘ War

era had large, organized groups of-9

common citizens felt they were
justiﬁed in using violence to
achieve their ends. We saw,
shortly after the Chicago riots, the
beginnings of urban terrorism in
the United States. It is something
we have not yet succeeded in
eliminating.

On the other side of the coin. we
have seen an increase in the
incidence of ofﬁcial violence. The
murders at Kent State, just 21
months after Chicago, are the best
examples.‘ They could not have
happened without Chicago as a
model.

In this series we have taken a
look at four events of the year 1968.
The ﬁrst three, the “victory” of
Gene McCarthy and withdrawal of
Lyndon Johnson from the Presi-
dential race, the assassination of
Martin Luther King and the
assassination of Bobby Kennedy,
each in a sense, led to the
fourth--the riots at the Democratic
National Convention in Chicago. It
was the climax of the year.

There was, however, one more
major event that year. It may have
been anticlimatic, but it was, in
part, the inevitable consequence of
all that had come before.

In 1972, Kinmont did a commer-
cial about hiring the handicapped.
Some Hollywood screenwriters saw
it and turned Kinmont’s story into
a low-budget but highly successful
ﬁlm,. “The Other ‘Side of the
Mountain.” The ﬁlm glossed over
Kinmont’s accident and her deter-
mination to overcome her handi-
caps. It also threw in a tragic
subplot about the fellow skiier who
loved Kinmont and helped bring
her out of her depression, only to
be killed in a plane crash.

Anyway, when the real-life
Kinmont married a truck driver 10
years her junior in 1976. and
remembering a wide audience that
caught the first tear-jerker, director

ended with “The Last Picture

least one thing “Part Two” can’t
be blamed for. His role is

paper-thin, but Bottoms doesn’t

Why tell Kinmont’s story again,
anyway? That once is not enough

into spawning sequels (the “Billy

Timothy Bottoms gives Marilyn Hasset’s jeep a much needed push in this

where Rondinelli and Company:
Virgil Walters (bass), Don DePaolis

Kenny Karsh (guitar) are ready to
play to some of the finest jazz in

He lifts his drumstick and taps
the symbol between counts:

and his company joins in.

“Yeah, alright,” some of the
people shout out. “Look at ’im go.
That Spider, he's a bad dude.”

“I used to be a hoofer, you know,
a tap dancer," Spider said before
taking a sip fromhis scotch and

Besides his interest in jazz as a

he got his first professional job as a

with such jazz greats ‘as Pat
Martino, Stanley Turrentine and
Red Garland, who played piano for
John Coltrane.

Spider’s band has been voted by
“Pittsburgh’s Music Maker”
magazine as the best jazz band in
the area, and they’re the resident
band at Sonny Daye’s every
Tuesday through Saturday night.

Recently buying a new Cadillac,
and a home in Clairton for himself
and wife, Spider can’t help smiling
when he says, “I love my job. I
wouldn’t change it for anything.”

Although he’s proud of his
accomplishments and enjoys rem-
iniscing about the past, Spider
realizes he can’t live in the past.

Summer Jobs Available--You Just Have To Look 

By JOHN RIGHETII
Pitt News Staff Writer
Once again, warm weather has
returned, the ‘fi-isbees are ﬂying,
and stereos blare from obscure
Towers windows for all to hear.
Seniors envision graduation while
the rest of the student body is
having one last ﬂing before the

A dreaded ﬁnals.

Amidst all this, eventually, one
question will pop into the heads of
all underclassmen—‘ ‘What will I do
this summer?” More speciﬁcally,
“Where will I get a job?”

Fear not. There are a number of
employment avenues open to

college students during the sum-

6 mer. Ifthey look.

One place to start job hunting
early is the Work-Study Office,
located in 626 Schenley Hall.
Work-study jobs are only available
to students residing in the state of
Pennsylvania, since the work-study
program is linked with PHEAA
(Pennsylvania Higher Education
Assistance Agency).

The office now offers part time
work from May 1-August 12 with a
range of 9-15 hours a week
depending on academic level. A full
time program from July 1-August
31 is a possibility if funds permit.

Summer Not Meant
For All Work, No Play

By TERRI VOGT

Pitt News Staff Writer

“What are you doing this summer?”
“I don’t know. I’ll wait until I get home and I’ll look in the want ads.”
Sound familiar? Every year at this time, students get anxious about
how they want to spend their summers. Somehow, the need to make
money wins out over the need to relax, and somehow, we manage to ﬁnd

What we students need is an extraordinary way to spend this time. We I
want to make the most of our summer months. Some of us will.

“A girlfriend of mine lives only a few blocks from Disneyland and a
short drive from the beaches,” Paula said. While visiting her friend,
Paula plans to spend most of her time sightseeing and swimming in the

In contrast to Paula’s free and easy summer, Karen, a sophomore
writing major plans to attend Middlebury College in Vermont for a
nine-week intensive study of Russian language.

“This program has been said to improve speaking skills by 200
percent,” Karen explained. “I cannot have any English newspapers or
iieiit t8 iii‘é’, ﬁlltl I Will BE speaking Russian all day.”

Karen is setting her sights toward the 1980 Olympics in Moscow. No.
she doesn't want to compete in the games, she wants to compete for a

another factor may be involved. The need to leave your girl/ boyfriend

Both are planning jobs at a new restaurant in Pittsburgh, Lenny a

and I’ll be assured that he won’t get any new phone numbers,” Cora

Lenny would be the ﬁrst to admit that he knows nothing about being a
waiter but intends to get by “on looks alone.”

Nevertheless, fellow students, we must remember, be it good or bad,
our summer jobs will only be for four short months. And we can always
look forward to returning to school in the fall, which, contrary to popular
belief, will not last forever. (Amen.)

From Coast to Coast

(Continued from Page 7)

“You can’t survive in the music
world if you don’t keep your music
innovative and fresh. You’ve got to
keep exposing yourself to new
styles and not always living in the
past,” he said.

To keep innovation circulating at
Sonny Daye’s, Spider invites young
musicians in the area to play with
his band on Tuesday nights.

“We call it ‘iam night’. he said.
“It’s a good opportunity for local
musicians to get some experience
and exposure and it lets us know
what kind of music the younger
musicians are getting into.”

Besides helping young musicians

- getexposure, Spider is helping

break down an old image of jazz by
exposing it to places it’s never
been.

“Jazz has always had this image
of being played in dark smokey
clubs late at night,” Spider said.
“But we’ve been playing it at 11
am. for Pitt's freshman orientation

program, to afternoon parties at
high society luncheons.”

The problems and tensions are
inevitable in a busy profession such
as Spider’s. But just as he helps
the ﬁeld of jazz by exposing it to
the public, jazz takes care of
Spider.

“When I've got things on
my mind that are bothering me and
I want to get away," said Spider,
“I tell guys in the band, ‘Come on,
let’s get behind a tune.”’

This getting "behind a tune”
according to Spider is each band
member’s intense involvement
with the music, which becomes a
vehicle for the musician to travel
mentally with the music.

“We’d like to do a nice song by
Chick Corea called, ‘Sea Jour-

ney,’ ” Spider says softly into the

microphone.

He closes his eyes and gently
taps the symbols and chimes with
the drumsticks. The song is soft

(Continued on Page 9)

Most jobs are on campus or in the
immediate area and include sec-
retarial, cafeteria, library, lab and
social work.

The program often includes jobs
at agencies and businesses in many
places in Western Pennsylvania
outside of Pittsburgh. Pay is
minimum wage ($2.65 an hour).
Since the pay is considered a type of
ﬁnancial aid for the school year, it is

‘necessary to ﬁle an application with
the ofﬁce to be considered for
employment. Unfortunately, this
year, the filing deadline for
spring-summer jobs was March 1.

The Student Employment Ofﬁce
on the second ﬂoor of the Student
Union is another option. This office
functions primarily as a referral
agency ,for Pitt students. Bus-
inesses and individuals from all
over the Pittsburgh area call in job
openings to the ofﬁce. They are
posted on a bulletin board where
students can look them over and
discover which location, pay and job
are right for them. Students then
apply to the individual agency.

The type of work requested is
usually sales, secretarial and ofﬁce
positions, clerk positions, some
tutoring and some laboring, such as
landscaping and warehouse work.
Junior engineers particularly have
an excellent chance at placement
through this ofﬁce as summer
trainees in their respective ﬁelds.

The ofﬁce offers many part-time
campus jobs as well as full time jobs
in the outside community. It also
has an excellent placement record.
Last year, 830 students received
spring-summer employment
through it.

"The Student Employment Ofﬁce

also refers students to government
employment programs such as
Pittsburgh’s programs and the
County’s Jobpower program, as
well as Civil Service jobs.

For those students in any
health-related profession, such as

‘pre-med, physical therapy, phar-

macy and nursing, there are a
variety of job opportunities. Phar-
macies, hospitals, labs and state
institutions take student interns for
the summer, some full time, some
part time. Although many health-
related jobs do pay, many others are
strictly on a volunteer basis, an
option open to those students who
consider the experience more
valuable than the pay.

Some students, both male and
female, who don’t mind hard work
or would actually enjoy a physical
job as a change of pace from the past
year’s dormant studying, should
consider applying to the Pittsburgh
area’s many steel mills and coal
mines, and also factories. These
businesses sometimes hire. many
students, sometimes a few, depend-
ing on the economic picture of the
time. They offer fairly good pay and
shift work, an attractive feature for
students who hate a daily 9-to-5
schedule.

One area of work which opens up
in the summer is secretarial work.
Students should try the myriad
ofﬁces in Pittsburgh and many
smaller surrounding communities,
even their hometowns, for these
positions. Certain skills, such as
typing, will always be required. But
one of the beneﬁts will almost
always be an air conditioned ofﬁce
where you can work pleasantly in
the middle of the sweltering
summer.

Another area is sales. Cashiers,
clerks and many other positions are

available both in large shopping
malls and small stores. Other jobs,
which generally involve manual
work or work with children can be
found through the County J obpower
and City programs, programs which
include park clean-up and mainten-
ance, recreational direction, road
work and renovation projects,
among others.

Job opportunities also await the
student in a number of amusement
parks across the country, with
positions varying from concession
stand cooks to ride operators to
entertainment positions for talented
students. Kennywood Park, just
south of Pittsburgh, hires a number
of students for the summer, as does
Cedar Point, King's Island and
many parks in New Jersey.
Students who would rather work in
sunny Florida during the summer
months can apply to ' work at
Disneyworld, where living quarters
can be provided.

Swimmers are lucky enough to
have the chance at jobs that include
swimming instruction and lifesav-
ing, spending the entire summer at
the beach or the pool.

Finally, a large job market opens
each year on the New Jersey coast,
particularly at student attractions
such as Wildwood. Discos, bars and
restaurants have a high number of
jobs as "busboys, waitresses and
bouncers available to college
students during the busy summer
months. Many establishments
provide living quarters for their
student employees.

Though there are many opportun-
ities, summer jobs are no longer as
plentiful as they once were. The key
to summer employment is to put
down that frisbee and get out early
to look for one. In fact, to secure a
job, it’s best to start in November.

“It should be very interesting,”
choir director Grover Wilkens said.
“The choir is very thrilled about it.
Each of them has taken a French
language and culture course to
better acquaint themselves with
the country. We’re looking
forward to a very good trip.”

The choir will sing both
American and French-oriented
pieces. Several of its selections will
be based on the Scott Joplin

composition “Treemonisha.” Jop-Q

Among its other selections will
be pieces written by Pitt professors
Thomas Janson and Wayne Slaw-
son. Janson’s “Mlle. Gerta” and

name, will also be performed by

and enchanting. As the song
progresses Spider uses it as a
vehicle.

He slowly but rhythmically tilts
his head form side to side, as if he
were on a vessel at sea. Sensing
heat from above, he tilts his head
back.

   
  

His face now feels the warmth of
the sun and its fiery glow
penetrates his eyelids. The heat
brings thirst; he moistens his lips

,1 lﬁvith his tongue and tastes the sea’s
J salty mist.

The “Sea Journey” ends and the
audience gives a warm applause.
Spider opens his eyes slowly.

The red ceiling lights spiraling
above the stage have taken the
place of the sun. The salty mist has

been replaced by perspiration When the dam broke at Buffalo Creek, West

Virginia, a lot of people weren’t as lucky as
this little guy.

Jamie and the rest of the Mosley family
made it up the hill just in the nick of time.
Seconds later, a wall of water swept all their
earthly possessions away.

Here you see Jamie in the Red Cross

By KAREN KADILAK
Pitt News Staff Writer-

The Pitt baseball team (3-2) will play
seven games in the next ﬁve days, which
even today, is a difﬁcult thing to do.
Including this afternoon’s doubleheader
with Robert Morris at Trees Field, the
Panthers will play twin bills Friday at
Carnegie-Mellon and Saturday at West
Virginia before returning Sunday for a
contest with Howard University.

It’s the type of schedule that can play
havoc with a team’s pitching staff. With
such a large number of games in such a
short ‘period, Pitt baseball, coach Bobby
Lewis will have trouble coming up with an
untired arm to do the pitching after Sunday.

“Pitching is going to be a problem for us-

in the next few days,” Lewis said.
“In fact, if you want to come up now, we

Broken at Relays

‘Sports

could probably use you to pitch a game or
two,” the coach quipped.

Tony DiSaia, the lone senior on the
pitching staff, Dave Crist, Tim Moran and
John Dindak have yet to start their ﬁrst
games.

DiSaia and Crist were supposed to pitch
in the season-opening doubleheader at
Robert Morris before the games were
cancelled as a result of inclement weather.
Weather permitting, the two will start
today against the Colonials.

Moran, who led Peabody High School to
the city baseball title last spring, and
Dindak also figure to play some this week.

Five Games in Seven Days Will Test Panther Pitching

The only action either has seen was
late-inning relief work in the Panthers’ 16-4
loss to Duquesne earlier this season.
“We’ll have to juggle the rotation a bit
to get fresh pitchers in there all the time,”
Lewis said. “It’s tough this time of year.
You get rain during the ﬁrst few weeks,
then the weather ﬁnally starts to break and
you have a pile of games to be played.”

PITCHES: Marc Bianco, a winner in
relief during Pitt’s doubleheader split with
Kent State, is scheduled to start in the ﬁrst
game of Friday’s doubleheader....Iim
Boyle, a loser to Duquesne, will get a
chance to redeem himself today against
Robert Morris. Boyle will toss the second
game for the Panthers...Don Koller and
Mike Luchiow will pitch Saturday against
West Virginia.

Regardless of the other changes he may

make in his pitching rotation during the
next ﬁve days, Lewis will pitch Koller and
Luchiow together in this doubleheader.

“They're a good combination to have
pitching in a doubleheader,” Lewis said.
“Why break up a winning combination?...
Lewis will stick with the same starting
lineup he’s used since the season started:
Art Bortnik at ﬁrst base, Dan Smodic at
second, Kurt Leitholf at shortstop, Chris
Mahalic at third, Rich Klein in leftﬁeld,
Don Nania in center, Mark Stephens in

right and Jim Pastin behind the‘

plate...Dave DiCello, whose homer in the
second game helped salvage Sunday's
doubleheader against Kent State will play
in the second games of the three
doubleheaders. Lewis is pleased so far with
the work of the backup catcher from
Pottsville, Pa.

Pitt’s Dave McDonald and an
880-yard relay team comprising
Dave Hensen, Keith Leckenby,
Larry Shippen and Bud Cooper set
two Pitt track records last weekend
at the William & Mary Colonial
Relays.

Although McDonald finished
third overall in the 10,000-meter
run, the senior distance specialist’s
time of 30.085 surpassed that of
former Pitt all-America runner
Jerry Richey. Richey’s record time
of 30:10.6 had been set in 1968.

The 880 relay team also did not
win its event, ﬁnishing fifth to some
tough competitors from schools
such as North Carolina State. In
‘running their 1:28; three of the relay
runners broke personal bests for
their splits of the 220.

“We were all very excited about
our record,” said Cooper. “For us,
this was really our ﬁrst outdoor
meet ' in really fantastic weather
conditions, so it was .nice that- we
could get it all together against such
tough competition. Some of the
schools we ran against in the ﬁnals

r have had four or ﬁve outdoor meets

already this year.”

Two Panthers placed fourth in
their events, one of which tied a
team. record. Freshman pole
vaulter Gene Roach, who establish-
ed a new outdoor record two weeks
ago, again cleared 15 feet to tie the
mark. Another freshman, Randy
Bailey, from Neshannock, Pa., was
fourth in the 1500-meter event with
a time of 4:01.

Another Pitt individual and relay
team captured ﬁfth places. Dan
Goodyear continued to high jump
around the seven-foot mark,

leaping six feet, 10 inches. The -

distance medley relay of Richie
Moore (880), Greg Conover (440),
Gary Siriano (3/4 mile) and Tom
Herrmann turned in a time of 10:02.

The meet was well represented
by several Olympic athletes who
competed in the men’s open
division. Steve Riddick and Charles
Foster, members of the 1976 United
States Olympic team, competed in
Williamsburg last week.

May 15 is an open, date for the
team, but upcoming meets at West
Virginia and Penn State, plus the
prestigious Penn Relays, are some
of the remaining events on the
Panthers’ schedule.

g Tim Didn’ Gt His Gu, Bt He In ’t Running On Empty

Pitt will announce the signing of at least two—and
possibly three—basketball recruits this afternoon,
and Tim Grgurich’s Panthers seem set to have an
average recruiting year even though:

*Tony Guy, the 6-6 high school all-America from
Towson, Md., who had narrowed his option to Pitt
and Kansas, will sign with KU and former Grgurich
assistant coach Bob Hill at about the same time Pitt

s making its announcement;

*Duane Wallace, the 6-2 point guard from
Baltim0re’s Dunbar High who was believed to be
leaning markedly toward Pitt by several persons close
V to Pitt’s program, will be flying to another school for
an official visit at roughly the time this newspaper
hits the Cathedral: , '

*Doug Arnold and Bruce Atkins, this area’s two
top recruits, have eliminated Pitt from consideration
(Arnold, in fact, will sign with Duquesne today and
Atkins may join him); and

*For the first time in five years, Pitt will not sign
the Pittsburgh City League’s most valuable player
(they were Sam Clancy, Sonny Lewis, Wayne
Williams and Mel Bennett).

Grgurich will tell reporters today that Darrell
Gissendanner, 6-2 guard from Clairton, and Ed
Wallace, 6-8 forward from Philadelphia Bartrum, in-
tend to play Panther basketball and have signed the
appropriate documents. He also may release the
name of another signed player, though none of the
big names connected with this year’s Pitt recruiting

campaign will be the object of tomorrow’s announ-
cement.

This will not be marked a good recruiting year for
Grgurich, whoseability to bring a stream of quality

«I players to Pitt has in large measuresaved his job.

But, though he will attract no exceptional prospect
this year, he has not been shut out, either.

  

This was a bad year for local high school basket-
ball. Atkins and Arnold are the area’s best, but
neither compares with Sam Clancy or Mel Bennett.
This caused Grgurich, whose focus has been almost
unfailingly on Pennsylvania and Ohio, to look
elsewhere for talent.

His gaze rested most often on the Baltimore area
and Guy, with whom lied, and was laid to rest, Pitt’s
only chance at an outstanding player. A Parade and
McDonald's All-America, Guy was the target of a
Pitt assault that almost landed the Baltimore area’s
best player. The prize-—a 6-6 swing man who can
shoot, dribble, pass, rebound and, it is said, play

defense—went to Hill, however, who went after Guy
head-on with Grgurich and won. 9

“We’ve been. counting on Guy for a month,” a
Kansas spokesman exaggerated Monday, “and we’ve
had him committed for two-or three weeks. We’ll
make the formal announcement Wednesday.”

More bad news for Pitt came from Duane
Wallace’s high school coach, who yesterday said that
Wallace will be making his first official visit today (to
North Carolina-Charlotte) and that Wallace might
postpone until as late as next month his decision con-
cerning a school. Several persons close to the Panther
program had said they believed (hoped?) Wallace
would sign with Pitt this afternoon. .

But while Guy is gearing for Kansas and Wallace is
waiting (the schools he’s considering are Pitt,
Georgetown and UNC-Charlotte), and though
neither Gissendanner nor Ed Wallace is going to start
for Pitt in the near future, Grgurich certainly isn’t
crying.

The Panthers, with six scholarships available (a.

seventh is committed to 6-4 transfer guard Carleton
Neverson, who should be Pitt’s best newcomer next
season), may obtain several players after today’s an-
nouncement.

The best prospect may be Scott Grevey (brother of .

the Washington Bullets’ Kevin), a 6-3 guard who
averaged 24.5 points for Hamilton, Ohio’s Taft
High this last season.

‘Disastrous’ Spring

Boﬂiers Trocano

By The Associated Press

This was going to be the time Rick
Trocano hoped to establish himself
as Pitt’s starting quarterback, but it
hasn’t been a happy spring for the
heir apparent to Matt Cavanaugh’s
job.

He came into spring drills in
tip-top shape and was ready to shed
once and for all the tag “good

runner, bad passer.” The results?‘

“Disastrous, ” he said, shaking his
head and furrowing his brow into a
frown.

“It’s been pretty discouraging
standing around watching the other

. guys practice. ”

The broad-shouldered 6-foot-1,
195-pound sophomore has been
reduced to standing on the sidelines
by a series of nagging ankle
injuries.

They started a month ago when
Trocano and a teammate tookpart
in a wrestling match designed to
increase agility. Trocano was on the
bottom, trying to reverse his ‘foe,
when his left ankle locked in the
wrong position.

“Tore some cartilage,” he said.
“It wasn’t anything serious, but
every time I thought it was healed
the ankle would buckle on me.”

The injury has reduced Pitt’s
quarterback corps to Randy "Bent-
ley, Lindsay Delaney and a walkon
as the Panthers prepare for their
April 15 spring game against an
alumni squad. A

“I could possibly play in the
spring game,” Trocano said, “but
without practicing it could be
disasterous. ”

On the bright side, at_least the
injury occurred at a time when
there’s time for healing. In the fall,
Trocano and Delaney will face their
chief competitor for the quarterback
job. He’s Scott Jenner, a
highly-touted junior college trans-
fer from California’s American
River.

Jenner will bring impeccable
statistics to camp-:—1,850 yards
passing, 121 completions in 195
attempts for a 58 percent average,
20 touchdowns and 4.8 speed.

Jenner also happens to be
bringing along his favorite receiver,
Ken Bowles. Bowles, a 4.4 sprinter
caught 44 passes last year.

The axiom goes that a coach
brings in a junior college transfer
for only one reason. To start.

How did Trocano react? ‘They’re
just trying to bring in the best
people possible,” he said, masking
his disappointment.

“The coaches want to have
quarterbacks who can play. It’s
better for the team to have three or
four ready. It’s been the history of
Pitt quarterbacks to go down.”

Trocano got his chance last fall
when Cavanaugh went down with a
broken wrist in the season opener
against Notre Dame.

Running a simpliﬁed offense, he
led Pitt to lopsided victories over
William & Mary 28-6, Temple, 76-0,
and Boston College, 45-7. He
rushed for 265 yards, third best on
the team, and passed for 317 yards
and three touchdowns on 17 of 39
attempts. ‘

Pantherettes Blanked

By BOB LABRIOLA
Pitt News Staffwriter

The Pitt women’s tennis team
had its record evened at 1-1 after
being blanked by the Penn State
Lady Lions, 9-0, yesterday at the
Greentree Racquet Club.

The Lady Lions, ranked fourth in
the Middle States Region, survived
challenges from Pantherettes
Maria Paris and Pam Bachman to
maintain their record of never
having lost to Pitt.

Pirate Don Robinson Admits Being a Reformed

By The Associated Press
At just 20 years of age, Pittsburgh
Pirates’ rookie righthander Don
Robinson is a reformed Cincinnati
Reds fan who almost played with
the Philadelphia Phillies.
“While I was growing up at

, Kenova, W. VA. I was all Reds and

the ‘area was all Reds,” the
ﬁrst-year pitcher said during his
ﬁrst weekend in the major leagues.

“There were a lot of teams
looking at me when I was in high
school, but sure, I would have
signed with the Reds if they had
drafted me. Ithought I was going to
go to Philadelphia. They were really
looking at me. But Pittsburgh
drafted me in the second round and
here I am.”

A 6-foot-4, 225-pounder, Robin-
son made it from the sandlots of
West Virginia to the major leagues
in less than three years. Robinson
credits his quick advancement to
throwing smoke, hard work and
listening to his coaches.

“I’ve never wanted to go to
college,” said the former multi-
sports star at Ceredo-Kenova High
School. “I’ve always wanted to play
in the big leagues. That’s all I’ve
ever wanted to do since I was seven
years old. So when I got out of high
school and got drafted, I ﬁgured the
sooner I got in the better.

Bachman fared well in her match
against Molly Wesner, the top-
ranked player in the area,
eventually losing, 6-1, 6-2.
According to Pitt coach Nancy
Gordon, the match consisted of
many long points and long games

undoubtedly one of the ﬁner

her a real battle.”

The Pantherettes, 7-2 in the fall,
offer only one full scholarship and
three partial, yet Gordon believes
this is the best tennis team Pitt has
had since her tenure as coach
began...

“In the three years I have been
the coach, this is the ﬁnest team
we’ve had,” said Gordon. “Not
only has the quality of our own
team increased over the years, but

one now. Larry Sherry, the Pirates’
pitching coach, worked with me for
two years and two years I pitched in

on nothing but the curve ball.”

Gordon sees the tennis facilities
at Pitt as the major obstruction in
the path of quality tennis teams at
the University in the furture.

“The facilities are hurting us,”
said Gordon. “There are only
seven courts on campus, which are
in poor condition and are not
accessable. Since there are only
seven courts, everyone on campus
wants to use them for recreation.
We just don’t have adequate
practice facilities.”

Oliver Begins New Career From ‘0’

By The Associated Press

ARLINGTON, Texas—He wears
“O” on his back because he feels he
is starting his major league career
from scratch.

He hits, he runs the basepaths
like a Whippet and he catches the
ball in left ﬁeld like nobody the
Texas Rangers have ever had
before.

“This is a player’s dream,” Al
Oliver said Monday night after the
Rangers had sent the New York
Yankees packing with a 5-2 victory
on a nationally televised “Beat The
Yankees Night.”

Oliver spent 10 years with
Pittsburgh in the National League
but never felt appreciated.

“Did you hear that ovation I got
for that catch I made?” asked
Oliver. “This is such a great
atmosphere here—‘to ‘oe appre-
ciated like that. My season is
complete now even if I don’t get
another hit all season.”

‘Oliver collected two hits off

Yankee starter and loser Dick
Tidrow, 0-1, who lost the first game
of his career to the Rangers after
seven victories.

But it was Olivers’ tremendous
catch of a long drive by Mickey

Rivers that brought the biggest

accolades of the night from the
shivering 14,299 fans, many of
whom were waving “Beat The
Yankees” hankies handed out as
they entered the ballpark. Although
Bucky Dent scored on the sacriﬁce
ﬂy, it kept the Yankees away from a
big inning.

“He’s an all-star outﬁelder
besides being a bonaﬁde .300
hitter,” Ranger Manager Bill
Hunter said of the hustling Oliver.

Richie Zisk, another of Ranger '

owner Brad Corbett’s million-dollar
off-season acquisitions, drilled a
two-run homer to follow Oliver’s
double in the sixth inning and chase
Tidrow.

‘ ‘It’s a great RBI position batting

fourth behind a guy like Oliver,”

said Zisk, another former Pirate.
“You have a .300 hitter in Mike

Hargrove leading off; then you have

'Bert Campaneris, who leads the

major leagues in sacriﬁce bunts.”

Dock Ellis, 1-0, dazzled the
hard-hitting Yanks on one hit over
the ﬁrst ﬁve innings and yielded
only an unearned run before his
shoulder tightened.

“It should be okay,” Ellis, yet
another former Pirate, said later in
the dressing room.

“It has been bothering me since
spring training."

Roger Moret, who threatened last
week to jump the team after an
argument with a teammate, went
the ﬁnalfour innings to gain a save,
permitting only one run on ﬁve hits.

“I have got to stay now. I'm
happy now," Moret said after the
Rangers had taken two games in
three-game series with the world
champions.

 

Little practice was needed for the
Pantherettes’ opening match
against Duquesne, which Pitt won,
9-0.

Duquesne was blanked in the
ﬁrst three singles matches by
Paris, Janet DeCostro and Bach-
man as well as by the Pitt doubles
team of Bachman and Janice Irwin.

Duquesne’s Jeannie Miller lost

to number-ﬁve singles player Jan ‘

Brownstein, 6-1, 7-5, which was the
most games won in any individual
match against the Pantherettes.

spring training,” Robinson said.
“You have to have it. The ﬁrst time I
got into an exhibition game, I struck
out four Reds in two innings and I
think I impressed everybody. Then I
got more chances to pitch and I kept
doing the job.”

Last summer, there had to be
some in the Pirates’ organization
who would question if Robinson
would ever make it to the major
leagues.

After being moved up to Class
AAA last July, bone chips were
discovered on his right elbow and he
pitched in just one game. After an
operation, he began working with
weights and pitched in the Puerto
Rican winter league.

After a shaky start, he ﬁnished
strong in his ﬁnal ﬁve games and
came to spring training with
renewed conﬁdence.

“I'd never been hurt in high
school, not one time,” Robinson
said. “I was worried about it, but
the doctors told me to start with the
weights and work on strengthening
my arm and I'd be all right.”

Always a starting pitcher.
Robinson had to become a reliever
to make the Pirates. A strong
performance against the defending
National League Eastern Division
champion Phillies during the ﬁnal
weekend of spring training solid-
iﬁed Robinson's spot on the Pirate

solid. _

It’s spring again. That means

slender Panamanian, has picked up

baseball at a pace far surpassing
the rest of the game’s stars.

rapped out 11 hits in 24 ‘at bats in

dropping his average to “only”

For years, Carew escaped the

partly because he played for a

not exactly a national media center.

from simply a star into a celebrity.

waged earlier in the year at the

The Pantherettes will be hurting
in the two and three mile races since
Becky Falck will not run due to leg
injuries. Lack of quality depth at
these events should prohibit Pitt
from challenging Slippery Rock’s
supremacy in the distance races.

The Rockettes are also tradition-

"I can honestly say that Pitt is at the top of my
list,” Grevey-told the Pitt news last night, “but I
won't be able to announce a ﬁnal decision for about
10‘days.” '

Grevey is interested in medical school and, while
he was impressed with Pitt’s athletic and academic
facilities during his official visit, he is “waiting to
hear from Yale’s admissions office.

“But, again,” Grevey said, "Pitt is at the top.”

Northgate’s Rod-Scott, a 6-4 forward-guard (for-
ward in high school, guard in college), also may sign
with Pitt later this month. Scott, whom Grgurich has
known since the prospect broke Grgurich’s jaw
(inadvertently, of course) in a pickup game, will at-
tend Pitt, George Washington or Old Dominion.

Another name on Grgurich’s list is that of Bill
Clarke, a 6-7 strong forward who played with Clancy
on Fifth Avenue’s state champions of 1976. Clarke
played for coach Bill Shay at Allegheny Community
College this season; Shay said yesterday that Clarke
would not make know his intentions until after

tomorrow, but Clarke may not wait. Duquesne, the

only other school interested in Clarke,,last night was

to make a take-the-scholarship-or-leave-it proposal,
but Clarke missed the appointment—he was talking
to Clancy and Pitt assistant Cleve Edwards.

 

The Dukes are able to be bold, since Norwin’s Ar-
nold (6-7) is committed to the school and Atkins,
Wilkinsburg’s 6-7 Roundball Classic Pennsylvania
MVP, is reported leaning toward the Bluff. In ad-
dition, the Dukes are said to believe they can, for the
asking, have Bethel Park’s 6-7 Torn Parks or
Schenley’s James Smith. Also believed obtainable by

Pitt, Duquesne Hoop Recruiting Pictre Coming Into Focus v

the Dukes is Schenley’s 6-7 David Thornton, though
each of the players mentioned plays forward and it is
unlikely more than three will be signed by Duquesne.
Pitt was concerned mainly with guards this year;
Clancy and Ed Scheuermann were underclassmen
this past season, but Pitt’s guards are relatively old
and Neverson already is on hand. Grgurich stayed
away from the City League, leaving that to
Duquesne, which became aggressive after Mike Rice
was named coach.
When Guy decided Lawrence, Kan., was the place
-for him, Pitt’s chance at an outstanding recruiting
year left with him. But Grgurich will not be empty
handed. The Panthers needed guards and it would
have been wise to sign at least one big center. They
have Neverson; they probably have Grevey; they
have a few players who, in the words of Ed Wallace’s
high school coach, “aren’t‘ players, but they are
prospects;” and they have the hope Ed Scheuerman
will lift enough weights between now and November
to make his arms thicker than the bar between those
weights.
That should be enough, though not by much.

  loe Frazier Floored By Hepatitis

By The Associated Press

PHILADELPHIA—Former hea-
vyweight cahmpion Joe Frazier’s
long-planned comeback was de-
layed again yesterday——this time
because the 34-year-old boxer is in
the hospital with acute viral
hepatitis.

Frazier’s May 14 ﬁght with Kallie
Knoetze of South Africa has been
postponed indeﬁnitely, his trainer,
Eddie Futch, said. ‘‘It really throws
things into limbo for the moment,”
he said.

Although Futch doubted Frazier
would be released soon from
Presbyterian Hospital, where he
has been since April 4, a hospital
spokeswoman said “Smokin’ Joe”
wants to go home. He was
scheduled to be released
Wednesday.

“He’s been pretty vocal about
that,” said Barbara Sigman,
director of hospital public relations.

“We are more or less playing it
by ear,” said Anna O’Toole, an
assistant in the office of Frazier’s
physician, Dr. Herbert Cohen. “His
liver tests are getting much better,
so he is getting better.”

“The only treatment is rest,”
said Bruce Wright, Frazier’s
attorney. ‘ ‘We're trying to keep him
in the hospital as long as we can.
He's busting to get out.”

But no matter when Frazier gets
out, O’Toole and Futch agreed that
he wouldn’t be able to train for at
least four weeks, and maybe two
months.

Futch added that Frazier was not
in pain, but the disease, in in_ﬁam-
mation of the liver, is debilitating.
He said that Frazier, who retired
from the ring in 1976 after being
knocked out by George Foreman,
was depressed at not being able to
work.

“He didn’t want anyone to talk to
him or even call,” said Sigman.

O’Toole said Frazier’s depression
and impatience about his illness
were normal.

“He’s used to running ﬁve miles
a day,” she said. “How would you
feel if you did that and were told to
slow down all of a sudden?”

But this latest postponement of
Frazier’s return to the ring does cast
a doubt on whether the ﬁghter, who

runs a gymnasium where he and
others train, will ever be able to
resume an active career.

Frazier announced the Knoetze
ﬁght on March 14, less than a month
after Leon Spinks dethroned
Muhammad Ali as heavyweight
champion, saying he would need six
weeks to get ready. .

The 10 rounds with Knoetze were
originally set for April 29 in Las
Vegas, but that date was pushed
back to May 14 while supporters
thought Frazier-merely had the ﬂu.

Two earlier ﬁght deals fell
through, one with Ernie Shavers
when promoters couldn’t put up
enough money to satisfy Frazier,
and another with South African
Gerry Coetzee when a provincial
board in that country failed to come
to an agreement on the ﬁght.

Frazier, announcing the Knoetze
ﬁght at his gym, said he was itchy to
get back into the ring.

“I really can't be happy unless
my mind is contented,” he said.
“You have to be able to live with
yourself. You can look around this
gym and see I neve1‘lleft.”

Spinks and Ali Sign for Rematch

By The Associated Press

NEW ORLEANS——Heavyweight
champion Leon Spinks and former
champ Muhammad Ali signed
yesterday to fight again for the title
on Sept. 15, and they were
obviously elated over the prospect
of additional wealth.

However, the title bout will not be
for the whole crown as it was when
they last met. Spinks was stripped
of title recognition by the World
Boxing Council because it said he
failed to meet a commitment to
make his ﬁrst defense against Ken

Norton, who now is recognized as
champion by the WBC.

Spinks still is champ in the eyes of
the World Boxing Association.

Bob Arum», president of Top
Rank, Inc., the promoter that has
the rights to Spinks’s next three
ﬁghts, refused to disclose terms of
the ﬁghters’ contracts and added he
has no intention of disclosing them
in the future.

However, the contracts add up to
a lot of loot. .

‘ ‘Santa Claus,’ ’ Spinks said of his
ﬁnancial arrangement. “Santa
Claus.”

He also had a quick response
when a reporter asked who would
get the larger share of the purse:

“Uncle Sam.”

Promoters expect a $5 million
gate from the sale of 85,000 seats in
the Superdome.

The bidding for television rights
started at $7 million, said Arum.
Butch Lewis, vice president of Top
Rank, said two networks were still
in the bidding, but he wouldn’t say
which or how high the ante had
gone.

NBA Second Season Opens

By The Associated Press

The Atlanta Hawks, at 41-41,
have the worst record of the 12
teams in the National Basketball
association playoffs. ut Washing-
ton Coach Dick Motta, whose
Bullets host the Hawks Wednesday
night, isn’t taking anything for
granted.

“They’re 11 players deep,” said
Motta. “If anyone fouls out, they
bring in another wave...the way
China built the Great Wall.”

one of three best-of-three
ﬁrst-round matchups which get
underway Wednesday night. In
other games, it will be the New
York Knicks at the Cleveland
Cavaliers and the’ Los Angeles

Lakers at the Seattle Super Sonics.

The other ﬁrst-round series
began last night when Milwaukee
played at Phoenix.

Atlanta Coach Hubie Brown
praised his young team, one of the
surprises of the NBA season, as
“totally unselﬁsh. They deserve
to be in the playoffs, because
playing the way they play is not
easy.”

The way the Hawks play can best
be described as non-stop hustle,
using a variety of zones and
presses to disrupt other clubs and
cashing in on the subsequent
turnovers.

Ex-Knick Walt Frazier missed
Cleveland’s last 25 games of the

regular season with a sprained toe
and is not expected to face his
former teammated in the playoff.
But New York Coach Willis Reed is
wary.

The matchup at center is
expected to hold the key to the
Seattle-Los Angeles series. The
Sonics’ Marvin Webster came into
his own as an NBA pivotman this
season, but he’ll be severely tested
by Lakers star Kareem Abdul-Jab-
bar, who has played well lately
after a disappointing ﬁrst half of
the season.

The second game in each of the
four playoff series will be played
Friday night with third games, if
necessary, on Sunday afternoon.
