  Religious Speakers

Praise Program

The visiting speakers who participated in the 1951 Reli-
gion-in-Life Conferences had only favorable comments about
the way the conferences were organized and the enthusiastic

participation of the students.

A written evaluation by

the visiting speakers reveals

their reactions to the conference. Their comments are:

Economists

, from the various ﬁelds of sociolo-
gical studies are being invited to

  Males Sporting

Black Chins ‘

, For Cup

The beard-growing‘ contest
.for Spring Festival is now in
its ﬁfth day.

Little sprouts of fuzz are
now noticeable on some of the
male population.

The purpose of the contest
is to help carry out the Festi-
val’s theme of “Pitt Goes
West.” _ . _ ’

Loving cups and cashprizes
will be awarded the student

‘ with the most unique beard,
and the one with the bushiest
growth.

The beards will be judged
during Festival week. «

0 Dr. Kirtley F. Mather: “I thought

it highly satisfactory.”

Dr. Edwin E. Aubrey: “Very
well organized . . . Found students
generally responsive and appre-
ciative of the Religion-in-Life
program. Keep up the good
work!”

Lt. Col. Robert M. Homiston:
“Very excellent. The build-up
before the week started has made
the discussion of religion 2: not-
too-diﬂicult project.”

Dr. Edmund H. Kase: “Remark-
able coordination and systematic
planning . . . Even faculty sup-
port for the program. I think the
program is designed to meet the
needs of the student body that is
varied, elusive, uncoordinated—
and it is accomplishing its pur-
pose as well as could be expected.
It’s a difficult task.”

Alexander J. Allen: “Very
healthy experience, (for the
speaker)—apparently so for the
students.”

Among students, seminars, as-
semblies, and group conferences
have been well attended.

In summing up the accomplish-
ments of the week, Charles A.
George, chairman of Evaluations,
said, “The attitude of students is
that the program is not one of
having religion crammed at them,
but one of objective presentation
and inquiry. Apparently, faith is
the answer.”

Pitt By-passed
By Flu Epidemic

The embryo ﬂu epidemic evi-
dently has not hit the University
seriously. Dr. Auleene M. Jamison,
director of Student Health Serv-
ice for Women, reported that there
were a “few m.ore cases than

usual, but nothing to qualify an-

epidemic status.”

Dr. Jamison also said that not
everyone with the sniﬁles is suf-
fering from ﬂu. 9

A small number of instructors
polled by the -News did not report
any marked increase in class ab-
sences.

Spring and Smoke

A quick glance at the calendar and a long walk in Schen-
ley Park tells us that Spring is not too far away. Spring here

student elections. .

Already many of the more enterprising politicians are
mapping out their campaigns, setting by a store of stogies for
the smoke-ﬁlled rooms, and generally letting the voting effec-
tives know of their existence.

We hope that there are plenty of these politicians on the

i make. In the past student elections have bordered on the

farcical. A few hand—picked candidates have had an easy time
of it. The situation has become somewhat like that which
exists in the South: nomination means election.

A great deal of the blame for the emptiness of student
elections lies with the student body. Few of them have even
had the energy to go to a polling booth. Like their parents
they have regarded voting as little, more than a low chore.
We should leave that attitude at home.

Let’s begin thinking and talking about the candidates
« for this year’s election.

Banned In Baltimore

By ED JENSEN

_ Owen Lattimore, who has been accused of a great many

things in the past, now enjoys the unique distinction of hav-
ing been banned in Baltimore. The patriotic members of that
city’s council, with more than a little prodding from the
American Legion, earlier this week decided that he was unﬁt
to address a student group, which.

had invited him to appear as a
guest speaker_

It seems that the charges made
against him by Senator McCarthy
have not been wholly eradicated

‘ from the minds of many people.

This despite the fact that McCar-
thy failed to make good one single
accusation.

No doubt Lattimore is still re-
garded as the chief “communist
link” in the State Department
largely because the newspapers
did not give his vindication the
same prominence that they gave
McCarthy’s attack. There were
few banner headlines announcing

, his acquittal; there were a great

many revealing his alleged guilt.
Acquittal Means Nothing
Nevertheless, it can be assumed
that public ﬁgures of the stature
of a city as large as Baltimore are,
and have been, aware of his ac-
quittal by the Senate investigat-
' ing committee. The ﬁndings were

. arrived at after long and sensa-

tional hearings. For several
months his name was a regular
feature in the newspapers.

The only conclusion we can ar-
rive at is that the city councilof
Baltimore has very little faith in
the findings of a Senate investi-
gating committee. Tney prefer to
take the word of McCarthy, who
still insists that Lattimore is
something other than a Johns
Hopkins professor. Currently he is
conducting a sly there-is-more-
to-Lattimore-than - meets -the-eye
campaign.

American Morals Low

This is a sad commentary on

 the morals of America. A man is

accused of doing certain things;
he goes to court, presents his case
and proves his innocence. All of
the evidence indicates that his
accuser is a liar!

Yet his accuser remains in pub-
lic oﬂice and favor. Nowhere is
he refused admittance. Few peo-
ple dare to call him what he is,
or, rather, few people are really
interested in what he is.

Whereas the man who has prov-
en his innocence must spend the
rest of his life living down false-
hoods. He cannot escape a past
which, in reality, was not his, de-
spite the fact that he leads an ex-
emplary life.

In his book, Ordeal by Slander,
Lattimore tells of the experience
of ﬁghting against a man such as
McCarthy. »It is an uneven bat-
tle. The charges, true or untrue,
once made, tend to stick.
Falsehood Sticks

The case in Baltimore is just
an example of a falsehood that
stuck. Lattimore, an educator,
who lived in the Baltimore area
for over ten years, has found that
his entree into the public schools
is not so welcome.

It is to the everlasting credit .
of that good city that the
school board reversed the city
council’s action. They reveal
a more discriminating evalua-
tion of a man’s word than does
the Legion and its cohorts.

I wonder what those respectable

. citizens would have done if the

Got a Light?

By DAVE WINTEIK "

A Chinese proverb says, “It is better to light one candle
than to curse the darkness.”

Father James Keller, scientist Kirtley Mather, theologian
Edwin Aubrey, and Rabbi Solomon Freehof all expressed
the message of Religion—in—Life Week in the same way.
Keller and Mather even used the same phrase to describe
what is needed to resolve the conﬂict in men’s souls, to quash

remedy corruption in high places,
and to combat the ‘what’s in it

I for me?’ attitude. They both call-

ed it ‘chain reaction.’

Old Story. New Title

It’s+been said many times be-
fore, and it is not changed by be-
ing dressed up in the language
of the" atomic age.

If the Stat’ Department fouls
up, if our. city governments are
corrupt, if our schools are begin-
ning to teach that right and wrong
are not absolute values butlare
in every case only relative things,
who is responsible for the result-
ing state that the world is in?

Men! People, who eat and drink
and talk like the rest of us.

John 0. Public. Diplomat

Who can correct the dismaying
state that international relations,
quality point averages, and our
own confused souls have fallen
into? ‘

Again the answer is people. It’s
our averages, our world, and our
souls, and we are responsible for
what happens to all three.

Father Keller has devoted his
whole life to collecting and

the resultant thleats of war. to¢

spreading stories about little peo-
ple who have changed the world,

Tankers Seek
ECSA Crown

JIM ZENTGRAF
Defends ECSA Title

:‘:

By DON MURDOCK
Eleven years ago Pitt’s tankers
were crowned champions of the
Eastern Collegiate Swimming As-
sociation.

This year" the Blue-and—Gold
mermen have their best chance
since then to cop this “big one”
of Eastern swimming circles to be
held in New York City this week-
end.

After ﬁnishing the regular sea-
son with a 6-2 record, coach Ben
Grady is proud of the showing his
team made. He says, “As far as
team performance and balance,
this year's team is the best we’ve
ever had at Pitt.”

14 Entered

Divers Al Ciocca, Jimmy Mc-
Hale, and Tom Blosser left for
New York on Wednesday while
eleven others accompanied Grady
yesterday. On these boys’ shoul-
'ders lies Pitt’s hopes for an ECSA
championship.

Defending his 440-yard free
style championship will be a tough
task for Jim Zentgraf. His best

.time this season in the 440-yard
,event was 5:12.

Bill Benzer oi’
Seton Hall was clocked at 5:02
last month.

Zentgraf will also take part in
the 220-yard free style event
where his 2215.2 time in dual com-
petition is better than any of the
ECSA entries.

Gover Improved

Breast stroker Bob Gover came
along strong in the later stages of
the season and should be at his
best this weekend. Sophomores
Don Fanning, a backstroker, and
Bill Corr, free styler, looked very
good during dual competition and
should have picked up enough
‘savvy’ to rate as strong con-
tenders.

Others ‘competing in the meet
are Orlin Johnson, Jules Melo-
grane, A1 Baran, Tom Koenig,
Herb Pfuhl, Dick Peterson, and
Bob Lepiane.

Last year the Panthers tallied
39 points and ﬁnished third. Seton
Hall gathered 52 points to win the
championship, dethroning second
place Rutgers.

Coach Rex Peery selected his ‘,

They are: John George,

sophomore heavyweight Gail Ellis.

didn’t fare too well. Cappelli and ’

Skirpan, along with Tony Razzano 1 .

and John Masarik, appeared in the
tourney and survived the first
round only to be eliminated in the
second round.

This year, however, the five
competing Panthers are expected
to fare much better, as the 7-7
season chart has indicated much
improvement over the 0-10 record
of 1949-50.

Cappelli (10-1-2) was unde-
feated until the ﬁnal match of the
season when he lost by a point,
2-1, to Harry Murdock of Waynes-
burg.

Seeks Revenge

Ray will be seeking revenge in
the tournament as the two may
be paired together.

Miller (12-2) was high Pitt mat-
man while Ellis went to the mats
seven times, winning six and los-
ing one.

Skirpan’s 8-4 record earned an-
other crack at the 4-I’s for the be-
spectacled grappler. Frank showed
especially well against Waynes-
burg, registering three of Pitt’s six
points.

George Reduces

Baby of the wrestling family,
scrappy John George, 6-5, has
traveled from the 123-pound class
to the l37—pound class for Coach
Peery.

Now he must drop to 1.17-pounds
to compete.

Familiar grapplers from
Waynesburg, West Virginia, Kent
State, and Case who faced the
Panthers this season are among
the 16 teams participating in the
meet.

position again this year.

The Pitt swimmers realize they
have a good chance of bringing
home the bacon. Before leaving
for New York, Grady, with an op-
timistic air, said, “If -we get the
breaks, we’ll make a darn good
showing.”

As if grid coach Len Casanova
wasn’t having enough to do in
searching for one assistant coach,
he is now faced with the job of
finding two assistant coaches.

With the announcement this
week that freshmen football coach
John Chickerneo has accepted a
head coaching post at Sharon high
school, the coaching situation here
has become acute.

Casanova h a s an interview
scheduled for tomorrow with an-
other prospective candidate for
Herm Meister’s vacated line coach-
ing job.

Well, look what we got in
‘Sports Editor
Pitt News

the mail.

I V v

“We recently read the article in the Pitt News regarding

Bill Sichko, a former student, ath-9

lete,“ and classmate of ours, here
at the University of Pittsburgh.
We take from your article that
B.ill is no longer in good standing
with our school. We would like to
know on what grounds you can
make such a statement as this.
As long as Bill played football
(or for that matter any other
member of the football team) he

,was a ﬁne lad! As long as he

took a body beating Saturday
after" Saturday and every day of
week—he was terriﬁcl! He
was O.K.!

Just Another Guy

But now football season is over
and he is just another guy; an-
other guy who is away training
to aid our country so that people
\such as you will continue to have
the right to be able to attend
schools and universities.

We realize that Bill was wrong
when he stopped attending class-
es after he received notice of in-
duction into the Marines—-a notice
which meant the disruption of
«both his school and athletic ca-
reer. . t

We wish to askiif you have
made a survey of college grades
and college attendance since the
icrisis; for if you have you will
realize that Bill wasn’t the only
individual who became disgusted
and dissatisfied with life at the
present.

Unfair '|'o Bill

Therefore, we feel that you had
no justification in printing the
statement that Bill Sichko is no
longer in good standing with the

 

University, and we also believe
you were unfair to Bill, since he
is away and cannot «defend him-
self.” —
CLASSMATES.
In reply, we "meant no offense
by stating that Bill was no longer
in good standing in the university
when he was called up by the
Marines last month.

It was merely a statement of
fact, and was no reﬂection on
Bill.

You admit in your letter, class-
mates, that Bill stopped attend-
ing classes after he received his
notice of induction. We take no
issue with Bill for his actions.

But the facts remain that Chris
Warriner and Bill Gasparovic,
who were scheduled to leave for
the Marines at the same as Sich-
ko, received last-minute defer-
ments because of their school
status. Sichko, however, was in-
ducted.

Our basic disagreement seems
to lie in the interpretation of what

j3}Fr0sh Cagcr Ed Hood

Recalls ’50 Playoffs

By WILLIAM DELSERONE
College basketball has its thrills. /
But there’s something about the scholastic ﬂoor game this time
of year with its WPIAL and state playoffs which rivals the collegiate

sport/"for thri1ls—especially to a
member of the 1949-50 Homestead
high school state champs.

At least that’s the way 6-foot,
150-pound Ed Hood looks at it.
And he really should know.

Played For Champs

Hood, who performeld for Pitt’s
freshman dribblers last season,
played two years of first-string

ball for Chick Davies while at .

Homestead.

During that time, he made the
Section 6 all-star team, helped his
mates win a class A state cham-
pionship, and also become ﬁnal-
ists in the 1949 WPIAL playoffs.

Those two victorious years were
emporiums of memories.

Number One Thrill

For instance, let’s just listen as
the blue—eyed, brown-haired Ed
recalls some of his playoff’ experi-
ences. - Of course, his No. 1 thrill
will always be the Swoyerville
game. That contest gave Home-
stead the state title.

“We weren’t supposed to have a
chance that night,” remembers Ed,
“but Coach Davies told us to use
a full-court press, and when the
game ended, we had a 48-42 vic-
tory.” P 4

Another exciting episode was
the Ford City game during the
WPIAL semi-ﬁnals. As Ed tells it:

Reluctant Hero '

“We had two and one-half min-
utes left and were trailing by
eight points. We tied the score,
and then went on to win, 48-46, in
overtime.”

Even though the slim, quiet
freshman cager was reluctant to
admit it, he also had an hour of
personal triumph. It was the Mc-
Keesport contest which Homestead
won, 38-30. Hood was the-hero
with 18 points.

Oddly enough, Ed wasn’t enthu-
siastic about basketball at ﬁrst.

While the intramural basketball
playoffs have ‘ield the spotlight
for the past few weeks,,IM Di-

ning competition in over half a
dozen minor sports. And with the
basketball tournament ﬁnally con-

uded, action in these sports has
at last begun.

Fraternity ping pong was the
ﬁrst topget under way this week
with 14 teams entered in three
leagues. Playoffs to determine
ﬁnal standings should take place

to schedule their practice time.
Separate meets will be held to de-
termine the fraternity champion,

Soccer League Formed

Hopes for soccer competition
have materialized into a three
team IM league. The Yankees,
Ellsworth Center Puddy Cats, and
the YMCA Panthers will all field
seven-man teams during the next
six weeks.

While it is still a bit too early
to make any deﬁnite plans for
softball, Bemis has announced that
entries will be accepted starting
next week.

Interfraternity bowling was con- -

cluded last week, with the PiKA’s
copping the team championship.
The Ph'i Eps were second with
Sigma Chi, Delta Sig and Theta
Chi getting points in that order.
A few determined bowlers have
continued to practice each week in
hopes of entering the Intercollegi-
ate Ten Pin Bowling Tournament.
While ﬁnal plans have not yet
been completed, it is highly pos-

sible that Pitt will ‘conduct the

tourney this year. It is open to all
colleges.

PittLife Reflected in Johnstown Center 

/

By DEE MORGRET

Contrary to popular conception, colleges are not the
country clubs they’re thought to be.

Ivy-covered buildings set in rolling lawns with tennis
courts, golf ‘courses; or swimming pools often constitute
John Q. Public’s idea of a college. A winning football or

basketball team also has a large
part in this fantasy.

But take for example, the
Johnstown Center, enrollment: 422
students—-130 women and 292
men.

An extension of Pitt, the Center
is located in a remodeled 50-room
grade school in a setting of hard-
topped macadam. The few ‘trees
that line the street in front of the
building do little more than cast
a shadow on the sidewalk beneath.

No Sports Facilities

The tennis courts, golf clubs,
etc. are non—existent. For swim-
ming practice, the Center tankers
use the YMCA pool l“l the down-
town district of Johnstown.

Even with these disadvantages,
the Center is still very collegiate.
It sports a Winning basketball
team which won the regional
championship of junior colleges
last year. The team is coached by
George McCrossin, the_captain of
last year’s Pitt varsity squad.

Social life, too, adds some

" By S. ALAN BOAL
Michael Bauza, Pitt graduate conversationalist in Span-
ish, got his education the hard way, in three different coun-
tries. None of them, however, was his native land, which is
the Mediterranean island of Majorca, largest of Spain’s

Balearic Islands.

Shortly after his birth 26 years
ago in Soller, Majorca, Bauza’s
parents brought him to another
island—Puerto Rico.

‘Because the coffee and lumber
ﬁrm" his father managed had
branches all over the West Indies,
business carried his family back
and forth between Puerto Rico,
the Dominican Republic, and Haiti.

I Launched in Haiti

Bauza began school in Haiti,
where classes were conducted in
French patios.

After his first ﬁve years of

0

school, the Bauzas returned to

Ponce, Puerto Rico, where in 1943 .

he graduated from a private
“American-style” high school.

He then spent two years in the
U. S. Army at the Panama Canal.
There he heard a friend in his
medical detachment speak enthu-
siastically of a skyscraper univer-
sity in far-off Pittsburgh.

Took His Word

This recommendation brought
Staff—Sergeant Bauza to this com-
pus in 1946, after his discharge.
