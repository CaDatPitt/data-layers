UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Outgoing SG Holds Last Meeting;
 — Candidates Evaluate Election

Ralph Manning (left) reviews material with out-

Manning Was Sure
Of Presidential Win

V By FRED FRANK

The results of the SG election came as no sur-
prise to the candidates running. Ralph Manning is
a winner who expected victory. I -

_ Manning, supported by the Students United for
Responsible Expression (SURE), commented that
by election day he felt he would win. Manning
said he was not «sure a week before the election.
But later in the week, he gained conﬁdence as he
saw his organization eﬁectively working for him
and, “as I gained more backing.” '

Manning sees his role as the organizer behind
bills presented to the senate next year. He feels it
will be his duty to negotiate for students with the
administration to get ﬁnal approval on legislation.

The SG president-elect expects the new senate
to be a great aid to him. Manning said the new
senators will be able to originate new ideas.

Nineteen out of the 23 senate seats were won
by candidates supported by SURE. Two of-the
other victors were independents, only two seats

were captured by the Pitt Progressive Party (PPP),

which ran‘ a slate of senate candidates.

The results of the Liberal Arts senate election
had been challenged by the PPP. But outgoing SG
President Jerry Hogan stated that .the challenge
had been dismissed by the SG Election Committee
and no action was taken.

The voting didn’t surprise PPP candidate Mah-
mood Mamdani either. While he felt he had quite
a. bit of support in the School of Liberal Arts, he
did expect a reaction _to the PPP. Mamdani said his

defeat came not because students disagreed with .

his policies, but because his opponents had suc-
cessfully identiﬁed him with Eric Stern’s SG ad-
ministration.

While Mamdani feels the SURE platform em-
bodies most of the PPP proposals, thePPP intends
to keep a “check” on the incoming senate; Even
though he is on the outside now, Mamdani expects
that he can be vocal enough to express his views
on SG actions.

Martin Engels said he wasn’t overly conﬁdent
throughout the election .campaign. He felt it would
be an “uphill ﬁght all the way.” When asked about
his role in SG affairs, Engels commented that be
felt he would be an “interested student” next
year. Engels ran as an independent candidate
with Bill Lerach as his running mate.

Manning and his running mate, Howard Ain-K

isman, won the election with 1,265 votes, with the
PPP candidates taking second with 894 votes. The
independent slate of Engels and Lerach had 719

Thursday’s meeting.

Hogan Rejects
SG Constitution

By NANCY FUCHS
, Student Government (SG) passed two major
pieces of legislation at Thursday’s meeting which
President Jerry Hogan promptly returned to” the
senate for reconsideration. ,

The new SG constitution was the ﬁrst legis-
lation passed at the last scheduled meeting of
the “old senate.” The second business was a dec-
laration that “the regulations of the Tower Quad-
rangle Committee limiting distribution of litera-
ture in the dormitories are null and void.”

In returning the bills to the senate, Hogan
called them “either totally unacceptable or un-
acceptable in part to me.” He said: “I assert that
we do "not have the right to declare University
policy null and void.” Since the Towers-Quadram
gle Committee is an administrative-student com-
mittee advising the Vice-Chancellor of Student
Aﬁairs, accord to Hogan,_ their decisions repre-
sents University policy.

Hogan objected to passing the constitution and
giving it to the student body in a referendum Feb.
4 as proposed, for two reasons. “First, I think it
should be as highly reﬁned as possible before it
goes to the student body. If the Recognition Com-
mittee wants some changes made, it would have
to go to the students again. Secondly,” I don’t, “I
don’t think we should thrust this constitution on
the new senate without giving then an opportunity
to consider it.”

In a last-ditch effort to safe" the constitution,
Senator John Ruskay planned to try to get the
signatures of two-thirds (19) of the senators to
petition for a meeting on Saturday. The newly-
elected senators were present at Thursday’s meet-
ing but do not take office until the SG banquet
this Thursday.

In his presidential report, Hogan said that SG
would contribute $200 to the Stanton Crawford
Memorial Book Fund. Contributions now total $450.

In retrospect, Hogan said: “. . . the past year
has been’ unforgettable. It has been a challenge;
it has been a travesty. It has been the opening of
new doors of" awareness among students; it has
been the clogging of standard channels of com-
munications within the campus community.”

Mary Rindlaub, chairman of the Area Campus
Coordinating Committee, presented a, special re-
port with recommendations for the future of the
committee. The committee is currently responsi-
ble to SG, Associated Women Students, and Men's
Council. Miss Rindlaub proposed that it be placed
under the sole jurisdiction of SG under the title,
Transfer and Regional Campus Committee. This

-committee would be chaired by an SG appointee
. with co-chairmen. from AWS and Men's Council.

Miss Rindlaub . suggested her co-chairman, Fred

Kurtzman Named do .
Acting Chancellor  

Dr. David H. Kurtzman was appointed acting chancellor
of the University admidst announcements of an acceleration
in the search for a permanent chancellor. The appointment-
of Dr. Kurtzman, presently vice-chancellor for finance, was
announced Sunday by Gwilym A. Price, chairman of the

Board of Trustees.

Dr. Kurtzman, a former state
cabinet officer with a career in
public ﬁnance, came to the Uni-
versity last July at the height of
ﬁnancial diﬁiculties. He steps in-
to the position left vacant by the
death of Acting Chancellor Stan-
ton C. Crawford.

Price also said that the search
for a permanent chancellor would
be accelerated. “For several
months, our search committee
has been considering a list of
distinguished p r o s p e c t s . That
search will now be intensiﬁed,”
Price explained.

Dr. Kurtzman’s appointment
won unanimous approval of the
full search committee, made up.
of the executive committee of the
Board of Trustees and six fac-
ulty members.

Following the appointment, a
pool of the full ‘Board met with
responding approval. “Dr. Kurtz-
rrfan brings to the position of

‘acting chancellor a combination

of talents critically needed by
the University at this time," Price
said.

Commenting on his_new duties,
Dr. Kurtzman said, “My ﬁrst
duty is to carry on these things
Dr. Crawford started to do: to
continue our approach to state
relatedness and to try to bring
our ﬁnances to the high standard
we accomplished academically.”

Dr. ‘Kurtzman will simultane-
eously continue his duties as
vice-chancellor for ﬁnance with
his new duties as acting chancel-

‘ lot. ‘‘I hope I will not hold the I
new post too long,” he said. “So ‘

I can return to the job the Uni-
versity brought me in to do.”
Dr. Kurtzman feels the Univer-
sity is making steady ﬁnancial
progress. “What we accomplish-

ed by the end of the year will"
prove to the community that our.

house is in order,” he comment-
ed, “We don’t need to prove our
house is in order academically.”

Dr. Kurtzman came to the
University from his post as Sen-
ior Research and Educational As_-
sociate at Fels Institute of L6cal
and State Government at the
University of Pennsylvania.

omic Strips

By ALAN DISLER

I Dr. James A. Kehl, dean of the School of Liberal Arts,
eels the images we have of various social institutions “come

"m-thecomic pages of the newspapers.” Dr. Kehl spoke

;“Politics in the Comic Strips” last Monday as part of
he Student Union Discussion ‘Series. ‘

Dr. Kehl stated that it is difficult to counter the effects.

these images and impressions.

articularly emphasized the
cations of Harold Grey’s fa-
’6us strip, Little Orphan Annie.
cording to Dr. Kehl, Grey

as. highly critical of the New
cal. -’ “He didn’t like what he
"w inj American society,” Dr:
Kehl explained, “In Annie he at-
pted to create what was being

sy bol of the independent little
erican we all think we are or
uld like to be. Daddy War-
ks, symbolizes the enduring
 ockefeller,‘ Carnegie, or Ford.”
He is a rags-to-riches story who
-proves" that America is a land of
equal opportunity -where those
with ability can become highly
successful. He proves this by re-
peatedly losing and quickly re-
gaining huge sums of money.
“Grey,” continued Dr. Kehl,
elt that economic regulation
and directives from above were
anathema to a healthy America.
He saw equal opportunity chal-
lenged by the New Deal idea of
equal security and did not ap-
prove. He was upset that the New
Deal philosophy was in opposi-
tion to the rags to riches theory.
, To emphasize his feelings, Grey
produced a strip in which Annie
and Warbucks visit a capitalist

. friend whose home was, built

long ago. Warbucks lectures
Annie on the era, years ago,
when the home .was built, which
was marked by unrestrained cap-

,» said Dr. Kehl, “is the.

italism and equal opportunity
and the phenonmenal growth of
the country.

The Wagner Act, which gave
Labor the right to organize, met
with Grey’s opposition. To com-
bat the Wagner Act, Grey put
Warbucks in charge of a factory

whose workers are being aroused _

by crooked union organizers. The
workers burn down the factory,
but later realize that it was the
capitalist‘ (Warbucks) ' who had
given them jobs and a living.
They work overtime to rebuild
the factory.

Interestingly, Annie met bitter
opposition from none other than
the Communist Daily Worker. It
ran a strip called Little Lefty,
about a shoe-shine boy who
would send his pennies to an ad-
dress in New York that solicited
funds for the communist forces
in the Spanish Civil War.

It attacked Annie and Grey by
name, and in one episode Lefty
sent Grey a wastepaper basket
for Christmas to “throw his Lit-
tle Orphan Annie in.” Said Kehl,
“It was the meanest strip I have
ever seen.” *

At one point, Grey gave .up.
He came to feel that free capital-
ism was dead, that the New Deal
has taken its toll. As a result,
Daddy Warbucks, capitalist, was
seen deathly ill, ﬂoating down

the river in a motor launch, leayv-'

ing a tearful Annie, independent
American, on the deck.
“But,” said Dr. Kehl, “Grey

‘later on brought Warbucks back
because he felt capitalism had,

another chance, that it could be
revived and become as powerful

as it had ever been. FDR had,

died.”

Campus Peace Corps Team
Gets ‘Lukewarm’ Response

, The ﬁve-day recruitment drive
conducted at the University two
weeks ago by the Peace Corps
received a “lukewarm” response,
according to Rudolph D’Amico,
one of the four recruiters. He
said that only six students sign-
ed up to take the’Peace Corps
Placement test.

D’Amico, .a' volunteer returned
fr_om~Mor_roco, said, “I don’t know
why the response was so mini-
mal. It was not as much as we
expected.” Supposedly, the Uni-
versity should be producing many
more volunteers than it does

Recruit Drive
Gains 40 Tutors

By‘BOB ZAVOS
The Hill Education Project

. (HEP) recently completed one of

its most successful recruitment
campaigns. Over 40 new tutors
attended the last orientation ses-
sion, bringing the total number
of volunteer tutors to over 200.
Most HEP workers spend two
to four hours a week in ﬁeld tu-
toring. They tutor _.elementary
and high school Negro students
from local poverty areas. HEP is
an outgrowth of the civil rights
movement and works under the
assumption that individual teach-
ing is the best way ‘to improve
the present educational and so-
cial conditions of an oppressed
minority in an affluent society.
Now in its third year, HEP has
expanded from one‘ co-o_rdinat-
ing center in the Hill District to
ﬁve centers including Terrace
Village, Hill City, Wylie, Ave.,
Bedford Dwellings, and South

Oakland. In addition to ﬁeld tu-
toring, HEP (has initiated In-
School Tutoring, College Board
Tutoring, and an Adult Educa-
tion Program. HEP also publishes
a literary magazine, the Horn,
and runs the Freedom Theater,
which produces plays on topics
concerning civil rights and other
items of current interest.

Co-chairmen Jeanne Cohn and
Loren Hershey, Newly elected Stu-
dent Government senator_ from
Liberal Arts, said HEP expects
to receive a $12,000 grant from
the Federal War on Poverty Pro-
gram. This money will be used
mainly fora full time secretary
to help coordinate the expanding
facets of HEP. The project pre-
viously received much small ﬁ-
nancial aid from Heinz Chapel
and the NAACP. The money is
used to buy books ,and to pay
for transporting tutors to the
various centers.

Although the constitutional referendum bill received overwhelming
support from the Senate, there are severalpoints which must be clarified
before a referendum is presented. The referendum should not merely be
hurried because the constitutional revision was done by members of the

-r outgoing Senate. The chairman and members of the constitution commit- ~

"xv

tee can still function in the new SG.

The student body should also receive copies of both the old constitu-
tion and the proposed revision before they are askedto vote. They must
be made sufficiently aware that the referendum will be an all or none
«cleal——if you want only two or three revisions in the old constitution, you’ll

have to accept all those proposed.

Since the constitution revision is the most important piece-of legisla-
tion to be considered this year, it should be completed as soon as possible.
It will set up a badly needed new structure, but more so, it would revise

several outdated-rules of representation and jurisdiction.

fI’heVibrant Voice of Oakland

After reading the Ford Foundation re-
port on_the University, I realized that not
only hadn’t students been surveyed but the
Oakland community had -been neglected. I
quickly grabbed‘ my bic pan,’ a scratch pad,

a"‘;,,. and a bottle of aspirins and went out to

-survey the Oakland elite. ‘

, My ﬁrst stop was the ‘home of ﬁne foods,
Frankie Gustine’s. Striving for a random.
sample, I selected a waitress who was mean-
dering her way from the bar to“the kitchen.

“Excuse me,”-I said, “What do you think
will be the effect of Ford Foundation report
on the Oakland Community?” She stopped,
stood still with a perplexed look on her face,
and said, “The Fords -are nice people, but
they just don’t know how to make a good
compact car.” 

BEFORE SHE uttered any other pro- -
fundities I thanked her and moved to the 
gentlemen.’s corner —— the bar. “Tell me,
Sir,” I said to a patron sitting on the edge
of a red-cushioned stool, “Do you feel the
new state relationship proposed in the Ford
report would hinder Pitt?”

I “What are you some kind of nut?” he
said. “What -do I ‘care about Pitt. I come to
i'\__ Oakland to partake in its vast cultural re-
’ ‘sources: Frankie’s, the Home Plate Cafe,
Forbes Field, and the Briar Bowl. I_ dont
think Oakland would be harmed even if Pitt
were hindered. You just can’t stop prog-

' ress because Pitt goes State.” I _ ,.

My aspirin bottle was now one-third
empty, my scratch pad had two pages ‘of
scribbling, and my pen was still full. Not

I decided to take to the streets, in the tradi-
tion of more progressive social movements.

“No mam,” I said. “I’m taking a survey
and would like your opinion on the recent
Ford Foundation report concerning Pitt.”
“Well kid,” she said, rubbing her nose vig-
orously, “If I were Litchﬁeld I wouldn't li_s'-

with the Edsel, and Pitt can’t afford to move
into the auto business-.”

tried a different approach, hoping to elicit
some helpful data. “According to the re-
port,” I said, “the new plan would increase
the student body and cause a need for more
local housing. How would you respond?”

“Look kid," she said as ‘her body leaned
against a decaying wooden doorpframe, “I
don’t mind picking up*a few bucs by rent-
ing out my attic, but not to those bearded
fellows or those foreigners. After all, I've
got my social position to think of.”

I QUICKLY gave her a courteous “thank
you for your cooperation,” as "a good re-
searcher must, and moved to the man-on-
the-street approach. _

I walked over to the corner of Sennott
and Bouquet, better known as the Holly-

‘ “Hello sir,” I said. “I’d like your opinion
on the recent Ford Foundation report on

lowering admissions standards?”

The bartender ran over to

the chubby Batman grabbed
a pool cue and swing it wild-

“Back, you Chinese devil!”
he shouted, _then sneezed
again from the dust his
swirling cape had stirred up.
The bartender yelled back at
him. “Get off my pool table
before I call the cops!”

The Batman stopped swing-

Chinese spy want with the

and fumbled with his cape,
producing a pair of black-
rimmed glasses which ‘he
pushed on over his mask."

“You're not Chinese!” he
gulped, and _jumped off the
table. “Good heavens there’s
been a terrible mistakel”

   McIntyre Paces

Redman to Easy
74-51 Triumph

By JAY ROSENSTEIN
As Bob McIntyre and Son-
ny Dove led the St. John’s
basketball team through
their warm-up drill, Dove
remarked to McIntyre, “It’s

'9. big crowd they have here.”

McIntyre quickly sized up the sit-
uation and said even more sar-
castically, “Yeah, I’m nervous."

The 670 people who showed up
for the Panther-St. John’s game
last Saturday saw an extremely
relaxed McIntyre score 28 points
and grab 15 rebounds to pace
the Redmen to a -74-51 win over
the hoopsters.

St. John’s could have named
the score. They played a Pan-
ther quintet that was without
the services of starters Stan Fa-
lenski and Ken Bollens due to

They played a. quintet that

aside from Bob Lovett (who had
17 points) and Larry Szykowny.

' (who hit for 14), managed the

minimum in offensive punch.
“We just couldn't do too much
offensively,” said eager coach
Bob Timmons.

“They are as good a team as
we'll play all year,” he added.
“We tried to shake them up a
little by using a zone on defense,
something we rarely do. We had
to do it to slow them up, but
all it did was keep the score
down.

“Their defensive play was very
tight,” Timmons continued. “That
one fellow (Bob) Duerr made
Szykowny work for every point
and every shot he got.”

Duerr is used to playing the
best ballplayers on the opposing
team. According to Redmen coach

' LoujCarnesecca, Duer has shack-

led Dave Bing of Syracuse and
Matt Guorkas of St. Joseph's.

“His defensive play has been.

great allyear,” Carneseeca said.
“He didn't let up at all against
Szykowny.”

Carnesecca was very pleased,

with the victory. “It was a good
win for us,” he said. “Anytime
you win on the road, and es-
pecially anytime you win against
a ball club that is always hust-
ling, you’re happy about it.”
The hoopsters accomplished
something of importance, any-
way. They held Dove well below
his 23 point average. Dove, who
seemed to be pressing a little,
scored 14 while he was in there.
Both he and Mclntyre had 11
points in the ﬁrst half to give
the Johnnies a 36-23 halftime ad-
vantage. Of the cagers 23 points,
11 were scored by Lovett and
six were scored by Szykowny.

SONNY DOVE ﬁghts for a lay-up as Larry Szykowny (40) goes to stop

Revenge motives and surprise are two methods of win-

both to beat the Youngstown J.V.’s, 78-74, Saturday.

The revenge motive resulted from the first encounter

 Mermen Topple Miami (Ohiot  

L’

gr
'.

r ance on the parallel 'bars this

By GEORGE LIES

Coach Ben- Grady had
something in mind when he
gave a wink to several spec-
tators prior to the start of
the swimming meet with. Mi-
ami of Ohio at Trees Hall
Pool last Saturday afternoon. It
was a sign of victory and the
mermen proved Grady’s fore-
sight by overpowering Miami,
60-35. »

The swimmers won by 25 points
on the advantage of nine ﬁrst
places, but the score does not
show how close the events were.

Don Hahnfeldt won‘ the diving
honors for. the ﬁfth time this sea-
son, but his last dive was a ca-
tastrophe. After Hahnfeldt hit
the water in an un-diver-like pos-
ition, coach Grady remarked,
“that dive may be the meet.”
Hahnfeldt won the e.vent, 211.65-
209.95 over Brad Smart.

Then after the Redskins’ John
Russell ﬁnished ﬁrst over Dick
Hulmel in the 200-yard butterﬂy,
the score was tied 26-all. The
mermen monopolized the ﬁve re-
maining events.

Gary Martin and Andy James
ﬁnished one-two in the 100-yard

Boni Drops 12-5 Decision

Heavyweights Flounder
In Matmen’s Loss, 25-10

L By TOM SACKS, Assistant Sports Editor
The wrestling team’s 25-10 loss to ‘Army Saturday

_ didn’t come as much of a surprise but the way it came about

was a complete reversal of what was expected.

The Cadets were supposed to have most of their
strength concentrated in the lower and middle weight divi-
sions. About the only hope the matmen were counting on in

that area was Dino Boni (145).
After that they planned to sal-
vage some points in the upper
weights classes. ‘

Instead, after the ﬁrst ﬁve
matches there were two big sur-
prises. The score was tied, 10-10,
and Boni had lost his ﬁrst match
of the year, 12-5, to Bob Robbins.

From 160 on the wrestlers were
shutout. Two of those decisions
were awarded on the basis of
riding time. Chris Zolikoff (160)
lost, 5-4,‘ when a one point ad-
vantage was given‘ Russ Baker at
the end of the third period.

Gymnasts Crush Kent State; I
15 7 Points, Three Year High  

The Pitt gymnasts crush-
ed a young, inexperienced
Kent State squad’ by the
score of 157.88. to 127.88.
Pitt’s score was the highest

recordedlby a Pitt gymnastic .

squad in three years.

In defeating Kent State, Pitt
took six ﬁrst places, four second
places, and ﬁve third places out
of seven events. The crowd Sat-
urday, in the Trees Hall gym-
nasium, was the largest to watch

"a home gymnastics meet this

year, despite the fact that a swim

meet and a basketball game were

in progress at the same time.
Pitt drew excellent perform-

ances from severa1’squad mem- ,

hers. Dave McKinnis, captain of
this /year's squad, took three ﬁrsts
in the ﬂoor exercise, side horse,
and still rings, with scores of
8.45, 8.75, and 8.55 ,
Jim Sacco took two ' ﬁrsts in
the side horse and parallel bars,
with scores of 8.15 and 8.55. On
the parallel bars, Sacco perform-
ed a series of C difficult tricks,
giving him Pitt’s best perform-

year. Tricks are scored accord-
ing to difficulty, A, B, and C, C
being the hardest.

maintained a steady pace to win

In his third event of the day,

iLa.ne overcame a body length

deﬁcit onthe third leg of the 400-
yard freestyle and handed James
a slim lead for the ﬁnal 100
yards. James just held it at the
wire for an additional seven
points.

The relay topped one of the

best spirited meets of the year
for the mermen and the triumph

Trackmen 1-1,

was their third in a row, evening
their record at‘3-3.

Although most of the events
were close, the 200-yard back-
stroke and the 200-yard breast-
stroke went to the mermen with
ease. Joe LeViers “stayed with”
Miami’s Mark Anderson until the
last 50-yards of ‘the backstroke.
Then LeViere whipped his arms
like a windmill in the ﬁnal leg
to win by seven seconds.

In the breaststroke, Jack Volz
ﬁnished ahead of teammate Chris
Price by three seconds. “The boys
are improving,” Grady said. “The
sophomores are doing their job.”
