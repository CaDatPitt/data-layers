PITTSBURGH — Surgeons pre-
pared to transplant a liver Tues-
day evening into 7’-year-old

Ronnie DeSillers, who received J

an outpouring of support from
Americans after his medical funds
were stolen.

Medical officials were notified
earlier in the day, that a donor
liver matching Ronnie's blood
type and size had been found,
but were uncertain whether the
organ was healthy enough to be
transplanted into the Miami boy.

’’It looks good at this point.
Ronnie is being prepared for sur-
gery,” said Lynn McMahon, a
spokeswoman for Children's
Hospital of Pittsburgh. ”When
the procurement team returns
and all is well, Ronnie will be
ready to undergo the surgery.”

The surgery was scheduled to
begin around 6 p.m. EST and was

expected to last about 12 hours,’ .

according to Miss McMahon.

”Oh good, about time,” Ron- A

nie said when he learned from his

-mother, Maria DeSi|lers, thatghe

might undergo the transplant.
”He "was very excited and
afraid” but then fell asleep, she
said. ’’I think that's his way of
coping with it.”

relations consultant, described

‘herself as ”very calm” as she

called friends and relatives back
home to relay the good news.

”lt’s the only thing I can be,”
she said by telephone from the
hospital. ”We’ve‘waited a lot of
time for everything, and there's
been a lot of pressure.”

The donor organ was from a
child with AB blood, McMahon
said. The hospital refused to iden-
tify the donor, in keeping with its
policy. T

Doctors estimated Ronnie
would live only months, perhaps
weeks, without the transplant. He
was born with liver ducts too
small to expel fluids, a condition»
that has caused his, liver to fail.

Ronnie had been hospitalized
in serious condition -since arriv-
ing in Pittsburgh on Feb. 17.

When president _R'eagan
learned of his case, he tele-
phoned him and offered his sup-
port. Shortly afterward, it was

disclosed that» thieves stole
$4,000 collected for Ronnie by
his classmates at the Fort Lauder-

Pledges of more than $32,000
came Monday from the
5,000-member crew of the air-
craft carrier John F. Kennedy.
Wendy Donato, an organ
procurement coordinator for the
Pittsburgh Transplant Founda-

tion, said it's impossible to know ' ‘

whether all the publicity sur-
rounding Ronnie actually con-
tributed to Tuesday's organ
donation.

The publicity ”doesn’t hurt, but
it's quite misleading,” she said.

”When Ronnie gets transplant-
ed, everyone will say, ’Oh good,
he's transplanted, everything’s
fine and dandy.’ But at any given
time, 300 or 400 people are wait-
ing for a liver,” Donatoi said.
”When one person gets pegged
likethat, people tend to think
everybody’s transplanted now,
and ‘that's really not the case.”

About 90 children are waiting
to have liver transplants at Chil-
dren’s Hospital.’ Nationwide,
about 300 Americans are ‘waiting
at any one time for a liver donor,

Honors College  

finallyopens doors

By Kelley Butt
Assistant News Editor

At yesterday's opening ceremo-

' nies of Pitt's new Honors College,

President Wesley Posvar illustrat-

‘A ed the purpose of the UHC say—.

ing, ”  excellence flourishes
best when there are no outer
limits on achievement.”

Open to all Pitt students, the
Honors College provides four
basic aspects within the college:
formal course work, special ad-
vising, academic community and
a close working relationship with

‘ facultyscholars.

The new University Honors
College replaces the University
Honors Program established in
1978. Prior to the development

of the UHC, students could take- ‘
' academically advanced courses

through UHP. However, honors
degrees were not awarded to un-

dergraduates.

The University Trustees have

. authori_z,e,d,tA-he Honors College to
‘award.

the ”Bachelor ‘ of
Philosophy in [disciplines].” This
degree will be based on the com-
petency of the student.

The student will not only have
to maintain a high level of
achievement in an approved pro-
gram of study, he must also per-
form well in an independent
scholarship. Each student will be
evaluated on his ability to

. produce, present and defend a

substantial piece of work.
G. Alec Stewart, dean ofthe

Honors College,

should be done for its own sake.

The highest attainment should be T V 
independent of level. The Honors. _ 9
College should be an affirmaton 

of this belief.”

The UHC is not designed to.be _. 
elitist or exclusionary, it y is-. ‘ A
’ designed to be expansionary‘.

Dr. Arlene Seal of the UHP,

said, ”Students do not have to

have a four point to enroll in. the _ 
Honors College- A student ‘just, , :' if
needs to have a great deal of in- '

terest in one area.”

The admission process for the
Honors College will not change

however, each student must ap- ‘

ply for candidacy for an honors
degree.

Seal added, ”The majority of
thestudents will not apply for the
degree however, they will con-,
tinue to take the honors courses.”

Pitt sophomore Monica Perz
said, ”Students.wil| have more

accessability to the new—.~Co|l,ege-j
- than they did to the UHP. The
UHC will offer a broader based '

education.”

”The University Honors Pro-. 
gram was one of the things that i

brought me to Pitt,” said -Jennifer
Trout, a UHP student."’The pro-
gram offers me the opportunity to

’ take the courses I want and to

pursue it as far as it will take me.-”

Investigation implies Regan failed at duties

WASHINGTON — The White
House announced that President
Reagan and Donald T. Regan will
discuss the embattled chief of
staff's future after the Tower Com-
mission makes its findings public
Thursday.

The investigation into the
scheme to sell weapons to Iran
and divert the profits to
Nicaraguan guerrillas will imply
that Regan failed to protect the
president but will not make any
specific finding of wrongdoing on
the chief of staff's part, published
and broadcast reports said.

At the White House, presiden-
tial spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
told reporters that Reagan and Re-
gan will ’’talk about his [Regan’s]
future after the Tower board
report, but not before.”

Fitzwater, asked about pub-
lished reports that Reagan was in-
volved in a search for a new chief
of staff, told reporters, ”To my
knowledge, it's not true. .I’m not
aware of any search for a suc-
cessor.”

Commission seeks to_
reassert sovereignty

WASHINGTON —— The
Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
attempting to reassert federal
sovereignty over the commercial
use of atomic energy, was hit
with a storm of protest Tuesday
from state officials and local
groups fearful of disasters at two
East Coast reactors awaiting
licenses.

At issue was a proposed
change in commission rules that
would allow the NRC to give
new reactors a green light even
if governors and local authorities
refused to sign evacuation plans
in the event of a major accident.

Gov. Michael Dukakis of Mas-
sachusetts told the commission,
”The rule you are discussing to-
day would make a governor's
right to protect the public health
and safety of the people of his or
her state virtually meaningless
once a nuclear accident had oc-
curred.”

WARSAW, Poland — Solidari-
ty founder Lech Walesa called for
increased U.S. economic cooper-
ation with Poland during a meet-
ing in Gdansk Monday with
actress Jane Fonda and her hus-
band, politician Tom Hayden.

Fonda and Hayden, who began
a four-day private visit to Poland
on Sunday, met with Walesa for
two hours at the rectory of St.

iBrygida’s Church.

Hayden, contacted by tele-
phone in Gdansk, said Walesa
welcomed President Reagan's de-
cision last week to lift remaining
U.S. economic sanctions against
Poland and advocated increased

his country. '

WASHINGTON — The na-

dissension, today endorsed a
sweeping change in national wel-
fare policy that would require
recipients to work in return for
government assistance.

The governors then headed for
Capitol Hill to lobby for their in-
itiative.

”We have to move quickly,"
said Gov. Michael Castle (R-

system gives the poor a choice
between ”security without pride,

Gestapo chief will be
tried for deportation

LYON, France — Klaus Barbie,
the Gestapo chief who occupied
Lyon during World War II, will
go on trial beginning May 11 on
charges of crimes against human-
ity, the state prosecutor said
today.

The order for Barbie's trial was
signed by Jean Chouleur, presi-
dent of the Lyon Court of Ap-
peals. The trial J date was
announced by Prosecutor Pierre
Truche.

B_arbie’s attorney, Jacques
Verges, said at the time of his
client's operation that it should
not delay the trial.

The charges against Barbie,
who was known as the ”Butcher
of Lyon,” stem from the deporta-
tion of Jews to Nazi death camps.

Task Force moniters organizationsfunctions   

By Frances Sansig
Contributing Editor

‘ An Allocations Committee spe-
cial task force has been proposed
as a measure to monitor the atten-
dance at functions sponsored by
various campus organizations,
according to Karen ‘Bohicheck,
chairwoman of the committee.

"The committee has talked
about it. It hasn't practiced it
[monitoring events] in the past,
but we have been hearing about
the lack of attendance at pro-
grams, and we've decided that as
a task force, we're going to start
sending members of the Alloca-
tions Committee to look into
where the money's going,” said
Bohicheck.

Bohicheck said she was
prompted to suggest the task

According to the questions asked

members on WPTS’s SGB talk
show, these are the issues on the
minds of Pitt students.

day, and Bill Boring, program-
ming director for WPTS, was

force after she witnessed poor at-
tendance at the Dr. Mary Frances
Berry lecture sponsored by the
Black Action Society as part of
Black History Month.

''I popped in at that one, and
I was very disappointed in [the]
attendance. That's when I
brought it up to the committee.
We've got to do something about
this — what if there are other
groups in a similar situation?”
said Bohicheck. '

’'If we're giving a lot of money,
and it's going to waste, we have
to do something about it," said
Bohicheck. -

At a BAS-sponsored lecture
given by Dr. Y-osef Ben-
Yockannon, approximately 10
people were in attendance at the
beginning of the lecture.

According to the allocation re-

"truly impressed” with the esti-
mated l,000 "people who tuned
in to the hour-long broadcast.
Other items discussed were the
undergraduate business program,
a midnight snack spot for students
and suggestion boxes (another

way the SGB would like to com-

municate with Pitt students). _
"We really are concerned

about what's being done on cam-

pus,” said Pamela Rich, who ap-

peared with fellow SGB member’ _

Melanie Naro last Thursday.
Although only 10 calls came

in, the show moved quickly, and

questlform, the BAS expected
250 in attendance for the Yock-
annon lecture.

"We want to find out if the es-
timated attendance is actually

, happening,” said Bohicheck.

''If it's going to be a large
amount of money that we're al-
locating, then we want it to be
publicized and have the students
there," said Bohicheck.

Bohicheck said, however, that
the $2,310 allocated for the
Yockannon lecture was a
reasonable fee for a speaker.

"Student apathy could be
blamed for the lack of atten-

~ dance. Or maybe it's not neces-

sarily poor programming, but the
program appeals to only a few
people who submitted the re-
quest," said Bohicheck.

The BAS, which receives the

largest allocation from the Allo-
cations Committee of all the other
campus organizations, disputed
arguments that there has been
poor attendance at its recent
functions.

"We have been getting the at-
tendance," said Tony Baldwin,
spokesman for the BAS.

Baldwin said that considering
the fact the Pitt—Syracuse basket-
ball game was the same night as
the Berry lecture, his estimated at-
tendance of 150 was good.

In the case of the Yockannon

I lecture, Baldwin said that there

was not sufficient time to adver-
tise and that Yockannon was not
invited until after the lecture ser-

‘ies schedule was printed.

"We have passed out surveys
in the past, and most of the
response [has been] positive,”

Baldwin said. "People really en-
joy the lecture series. When we
played Syracuse, we -still
managed to get a large number of
people to see Dr. Mary Berry.”

Darryle Taylor, who graduated

in 1980.with a B.A. in sociology - ‘I I

from Pitt, said he has attended
several _of the lectures, including

the Dr. Mary Frances Berry lec-

ture, and plans to attend the
Maya Angelou lecture tonight.
"These are all people every,-
body should see. All of these peo-
ple are very important. The

turnout [for past lectures] was lax. '

But I think that's due to an
apathetic attitude and maybe-
even promotion’ more than3any-

thing. The black populace at Pitt “ _ ii

We should write

I—— and be heard

The Student Government Board and the Governmental Re-

I Iations Committee are urging students to fight President Rea-

gan’s proposed cuts in theeducation budget with a letter-writing
campaign. Since 75 percent of the students at this university
may be affected by the 46 to 47 percent cut, fighting it should
be of primary importance. ' _

Pitt students arecontinually being criticized as apathetic. If
Pitt students don't shrug off their characteristic apathy on the
issue of federal student aid, they may end up no longer being
Pitt students.

Reagan wants tocut the education budget in half, yet col-
lege tuitionirises-»1«0 percent every year. Soon, college may be
too expensive for many students. Even now many_potentiaI stu-
dents are prevented from attending college because of the cost.

We support the SGB’s letter-writing campaign and urge all
students to let’ their congressmen know how they feel about
cuts in student aid and the new Income Contingent Loan
Program.

The huge cuts proposed by President Reagan may radically

' alter the future of post-secondary education. Fewer students will

be able to afford college, thereby depriving not only themselves
of an education, but also society of educated members.

College students allow themselves to be politically vulnera-
ble by rarely exercising their political influence. The only way
for the SGB’s letter-writing campaign to be effective is for ev-
ery student to take part. The Reagan administration wants to
trade in the future of education. We have the resources to stop

.it, if we care to. If the government succeeds in implimenting

I the new changes in federal aid, we the students will have,'in

part, ourselves and our apathy to thank. _ '

I,

Monday morning, 4a.m.

At 3 a.m. afew nights ago, I

couldn't sleep. I couldn't even -

stay in bed. I paced my Tower C
cell a few thousand times, stared
at the walls, the ceiling, my
broken television. I practically
memorized every inch of my ce-
ment shoebox room, but I was
still very much awake.

I tried to read. Sitting at my
desk, I opened my political
science text book. After three

pages, I looked up and then for-
got what I was reading about. The

words looked like another lan-
guage, and I stared at the spaces
between the lines. For a moment,
it seemed I could melt the book
with my eyes. .

My phone was broken so I
couldn't call for help. What the
hell was wrong with me?

I scanned over the cluttered
notes clipped to my bulletin
board —— each of them reminding
me of something that had to be
done. Some were months old.

Writing notes to myself never
really helped my memory and or-
ganization. I'd usually forget to
look at something once I wrote it.

MARC
DIICIIIIN

However, as I read each note,
I experienced an uncomfortable
rush of responsibility.

It seemed hopeless. lhere
would always be new errands to
run, more work, more pressure.
I was up against an endless flow
of deeds to be done.

I looked out my window. I had
a lovely view of Tower B 30 feet
in front of me.

All but one of the windows I
could see were dark. I could see
a faint shadow through the cur-
tainI of the lighted window. I
rubbed my eyes and turned my
mind away from depression. Poor
bastard, I thought, as the shadow
moved back and forth into view,
he must be looking at his bulle-
tin board.

_ I felt sorry for him and realized
I felt sorry for myself. Suddenly,
a new attitude formed in my
mind: What else is life but a cons-

tions? People can't progress if
they turn away from responsibil-

has a different idea of self worth,
everyone has an accomplishment
to strive for.

but only difficult, so we can en-

having a nervous breakdown. My

only comfort was a lighted win-

I saw the light go out.

I was alone and emotionally

-Many questions can be raised

time has come when high school
seniors across "this country should
stop having to pay to take a test
which indicates the socio-

economic position of the stu-
dent's parents rather than the stu-
dent's ability to work. Why do

'minorities do worse on the test

than their educational disadvan-
tages can account for? How sub-
stantive can the test be if some
coaching companies regularly
improve scores more than 150
points? How genuine are the
scores ifso many people are
known to cheat on such poorly
proctored exams? How can the
Educational Testing Service,
which makes the SAT, be trusted
to monitor its performance when

this, their most profitable test, ac- ,

counts for much- of their revenue?
‘The Scholastic Test is not ob-
jective: It is not a valid or relia-

to have such a touchstone, this

test is not it. As David Owen

The Carnegie Foundation for

which helped the College Board

need not require their students to
take the SAT because most col-
leges no longer admit selective-
ly. If they are going to let
everyone in anyway, why should
they require their applicants to

‘ spend time and money on a test

they don't need? _
This means that Brown, and

your school,_ as well as a few

other colleges that do have com-

ones who benefit from the pro- I
gram at all. If we get little use out ‘
of the SAT, ‘why should we wor- ' I a

will more urgently ask ”Why not
us too?”

As students at Brown, we are
concerned about the ‘SAT being
used on our campus. Questions
of bias, inaccuracy and practical-
ity lead us to push for a re-
evluation of of the SAT on ‘our

‘ THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, February 25, 1987

Is he erecting a barrier?

Q: My Iove’s foreplay is excel-
lent, but he never can have an
erection. This has happened
three times over a period of
months. He has sex with his wife,

his secretary and me, so I assume '

the others turn him on more than

9 I do. He is insulting to me after

these sex episodes. What is my
problem with this man? A

A: Your problem is threefold:
first, that you know him; second,
that he asked you to go to bed;
third, that you said yes. And you
let it happen three times, and you

are the third woman. Why would

you ever treat yourself so badly
as to get involved with a -nitwit

like that, who has all these wom- ,

en who have to know about ‘each

-other and in the end may get

together and compare ‘notes?

Let's get something straight —
I never saw you that l__know of,
but you deserve a whole man of
your own, all to yourself. And
please understand if, in early en-
counters with you, a man fails to
have an erection, it's mainly his
bad luck, perhaps a little disap-
pointing to you, but not impor-
tant. And your fault! You might
be the most exciting to him of all
his women, and that might cause
his difficulties. It is seldom»be-
cause the woman is less attractive
or less demanding.

If he is abusive and blames you
after these unfortunate encoun-
ters, it is because he doesn't want
to admit his failure, in spite of the

fact that he is (I feel pretty sure) .

only repeating with you what
happens with the others.

Let me say that if you came to
my office, I would tell you to
drop this guy. And if he came to
my office, I would tell him to stop
trying it with all these women
and instead concentrate on get-

ting it right with just one of them
because sex therapy works better
for people in a partnership, not
for one man who is trying to
prove himself with a harem. He
might listen because he is bright
enough to do good foreplay — al-
ways a good sign.

Q: My friend persists in putting
his 28-year-old daughter on his
knee, kissing her, embracing her
and stroking her arms. I am sure

she is embarrassed, but keeps .

quiet because she is’ afraid of
offending her father. I suggested
this to my friend, but he said she’
liked to be petted as a child. I
would ‘appreciate your com-
ments about this. '

A: I think it is too bad that
something like this has to come
between friends, but it does hap-
pen that some part of a friend's
behavior is disappointing or dis-
turbing, and we have to just put
up with it or register a mild
protest.

For instance, an otherwise

nicely behaved woman is rude to
waitresses; I have to tell her I
don't like that, but I don't tell her
in a way to break up the friend-

ship. Sometimes I say, "The
treat’s on me because I don't
want to hear you browbeat the
waitress.” Sometimes, I admit, I
don't feel up to having lunch with
her. '
Maybe your friend is not as
weird or potentially evil as you
fear because there is a wide vari-
etyof acceptable behavior pat-
terns in different cultures. In
many ethnic groups, ‘there is
much more physical contact be-
_tween family members than you
seem to have grown up with, and
it doesn't mean latent incest. And
there are variations of behavior
from -family to family.

There are the mouth-kissing fa-

Imilies and the cheek-kissing

ones, for example. I suggest that
you meet your friend at the Y or
where you have a beer instead of
where his daughter will be.

Q: How should I handle girls

(who think that sex is pleasure
only forthe guy and who act as .

if they are doing a big favor by
”giving” you sex? '

A: Don't handle girls like that
at all. Ifyou really know a girl like

_that, she has a wrong attitude

toward sex that will make trouble
in any marriage she gets into, be-

cause a man loses desire for a -

woman who thinks she is bestow-
ing something on him for which
he has to pay in goods and serv-
ices —~ not to mention cash.
But something tells me that you
have some idea that you should
be meeting lots of women who
are obliged to enter pleasurable
sex contracts with you with no

.. commitmenton your part. This is

not likely to happen, so forget it.
Most women want to have sex
with men who share their lives

and who give and take all kinds A

of support.

Racism can't be status quo

Why is everybody picking on '

poor Buckwheat?

With all due respect to the
Wilkinsburg City Council and the
NAACP, isn't there enough racial

tension without creating racial is-
‘ sues where none exist?

Wilkinsburg Council is decid- -

ing whether to take "disciplinary
action” against Wilkinsburg
police officers for selling and
wearing "B‘uckwheat” T—shirts.
The shirts are printed with a like-

ness of the Little Rascals charac— A

ter and the words, "Buckwheat
says Wilkinsburg police are
ohtay.”

NAACP President Bob Pitts told
The Pittsburgh Press, "We’re say-
ing that they're hurting our feel-

. ings by using an image that's

derogatory."

The image is only derogatory if
we assume that Buckwheat was
chosen to represent blacks in
general, and that assumption is
just a little far-fetched.

What if the Wilkinsburg police

had chosen some other persona|- ‘

ity — say The Fonz of the old
ABC series, Happy Days —— and

printed up T-shirts that read, "The ‘

Fonz says Wilkinsburg police are
cool.” Are we to assume that the
Ita|ian—American community
would be up in arms, claiming
that the T-shirts are offensive to
Italian-Americans?

Buckwheat T-shirts have been
popular since comedian Eddie
Murphy popularized the 1930's

film character on Saturday Night
Live. He also popularized Gum-
by and parodies of Mr. Rogers
and Stevie Wonder. When Mur-
phy performed these skits, he was
parodying only those specific'per-
sonalities; he wasn't mocking all
blind singers or all hosts of chil-
dren’s television shows or even
all green rubber toys.

The claim that the T-shirts are
offensive to blacks carries sever-
al implications. Granted, police
officers are public officials, and
their conduct is more carefully
scrutinized than those not in the
public eye. And I suppose people
in general have a right to be
offended by whatever they de-
cide is offensive. But this is get-
ting out of hand. The word
"overkill" comes to mind.

Wilkinsburg Council President:
_ Jean Kirkland wants the officers

\. 

there's,_already enough. A _

 

to apologize. Apologize to
whom? To her? To the council?
Toblacks in general? One of the
officers who was selling the shirts
is black. Does he owe himself an
apology, too?

We've all been thinking it, so
I might as well say it: What about
those T-shirts we've been seeing
around campus that fead, "Black

by Popular Demand.” It never

occurred to me to; be offended; I

thought it was a clever pun. But '

apparently clever T-shirts can't be

accepted at face value. _|s it real-

_ly— more popular to be black? Do
they really mean that the reason
they're .black‘ is because it's
popular?

This whole T-shirt ‘scandal
(Buckwheatscam?) has the poten-
tial to escalate to ridiculous
proportions. But the underlying
consequenses are anything but
ridiculous. The issue can do noth-
ing‘ more than damage racial rela-
tionships, which are already a
little unstable in Pittsburgh.

The racial tension in Pittsburgh
is very real. Take a look at the

"Letters" section over on the op- '

posite page if you don't believe

me. But a lot of the tension is ‘

created unintentionally when

. members of one race take offense

where no offense was intended,
when issues become confused.

._ I guess I feel so close to thattrial because it was the first ‘major

a summer intern at the Chicago Sun-Times, and on Sunday night
before the trial was to begin, I asked an assistant city editor who
he was assigning to the trial in the morning‘. Hegave me the ‘ ‘
names of a legal writer and a courthouse reporter. I askedhim —
who was being assigned to cover the riots that would take place
in the streets. Heasked me what riots. I said that surely the sup-
porters of the Chicago Seven would be causing trouble. _
So he-told me to report to_ the Federal Building in the mom‘- .

the street violence, and it carried my byline. From that morn-

and disadvantage; the Chicago Seven trial was the first trial I
had ever covered, so I was working under the assumption that 
all trials were that crazy and exciting. ‘ v

‘ It was madness; it was lunacy. The defendants came into the
courtroom one day wearing black judicial robes to mock Judge
Julius J. Hoffman. There were regular shouting matches between
the defendants and the judge.

The whole country was paying attention. The trial was fea-
tured on the network newscasts each night, and every major
newspaper, magazine and wire service in the country had
reporters on the scene. The time came for me to leave my sum-
mer internship and go back to school; the paper asked me to

stay on and cover the trial, and I knew that I would be misera- , . -.

I'm not sure what has happened to the country during these

Questionable conduct displayed by Pitt fans 

I It was a sad thing to watch
the fans at Pitt's last home
‘ basketball game this season.

Monday night, when Pitt
defeated Villanova, the crowd
focused on opponent Doug
West, a sophomore forward
‘who was quoted last year by a
Lexington, Ky., newspaper as

I saying he was offered $10,000
to accept a basketball scholar-
shipfrom Pitt.

Perhaps West's statements
were intended as a vicious and
potentially damaging attack on
the Pitt basketall program. But
one has to seriously doubt that
he sat down one evening after
a Villanova practice session
and thought to himself, ’’I hate

’ Pitt so much, I’m going to

make up a storyabout them.”

West was a highly touted
player coming out of high
school. Pitt, like other schools,’
very much wanted him to at-
tend school here.

No one but the people at
Villanova know what prompt-
ed West to take the story to a
paper in Lexington, Ky. The
result was an inconclusive

ing Pitt fans look like a large
collection of goofs who care
little about the sport of
basketball.

West certainly didn't seem to
be affected by the catcalls and
bill waving. He played as well,
if not better, than most players
on the court.

‘ Coach Paul Evans was prob-
ably the most irritated by the
actions. At one point, he asked

noise down, something is go-
ing wrong.

The crowd’s actions could
be justified ifthe intent was to
help the team win the game.
The fact is the only intention
was to belittle a young man
who was playing an excellent
game. It was unsolicited abuse
simply for the sake of abuse in
general.

It also must be considered
that West's allegations may
have some truth in them.
Philanthropic alumni are not a
new thing to college sports.
The possibility of such a viola-
tion of rules at Pitt is not out
of the question.

It is as if selected fans are
saying through their actions
that two wrongs may in some
way make a right. To have
such an adoration for Pitt
sports that it would lead to be-
lieving the program cannot do
wrong is naive and foolish.

The badgering will probably
go on as long as West is in a
Villanova uniform. It will be a
shame if it does.

PennState University in for another tuition hike  

By David Morris

HARRISBURG —— Pennsylvania

Jordan said Monday that a tuition
increase will be necessary next

”This is the first time an‘ under

plantation will be offered,” said
Gutkind.‘

The course will begin with the
International Organ Transplant
Forum to be held in the Pitts-

September-

”The forum will bring approx-
imately 2,000 surgeons, sci_entists
and transplant recipients together

from around the world,-” said.

Gutkind.

According to the course

transplantation and the challeges
and problems it poses.

The evolution of modern sur-
gery and the concept of rejection
and immunosuppression will be
described in class. Gutkind will
also lead discussions concerning
the legal, ethical and economic
problems involved in transplan-

Rep. Russell Letterman (D-

only 1 percent. H

Jordan was at the Capitol to
meet with members of the Legis-

of the‘ caucus.

”This caucus is not going to go

ed the group's several dozen
members should be able to in-
fluence other members of the
General Assembly and Gov.
Robert P. Casey's budget aides.

In the 1985-86 school year, a
Penn State undergraduate paid
$3,230 in tuition and fees. Jordan
and other Penn State officials did

not say how much tuition might’

increase, since the size of Casey's

Letterman said a Penn State stu-
dent pays 59 percent of the cost
of a Penn State education, with
state and federal funds making up
the difference. By comparison’, a
bi-partisan legislative report

tem of higher education pays 36

percent of the cost, with state and -

maining 64 percent.

Bartsch also said the girl's
mother did not want the incident
made public. ”She requested
confidentiality  and strongly in-
sisted that that reporting would
be damaging to the child.’’

The girl's mother alleged in tes-
timony that the abuse occurred
from 1981 to 1984. After she

_ learned of it from the girl in

March 1985, she went to a vic-
tim abuse center in Johnstown.

There, she said, she was told
that the case normally would be
reported to state authorities, but
it wouldn't if the mother called a
counselor immediately for an ap-
pointment.

not want publicity and called

months, she said.

College students who find jobs
before they graduate are like-

-that are more related to their
major fields of study, accord-
ing to economists.

”The method and timing of‘
a graduate’s job search maybe
equally as important as the

Bowman published his find-

Fate of LCB still

undecided in state

By David Morris

Associated Press Writer

HARRISBURG — The chair-
man of the House Liquor Control
Committee introduced a resolu-
tion yesterday that says the
General Assembly will take ”all
actions necessary” to resolve the
fate of the Liquor Control Board.

But the committee again failed
to act on any proposed bills that
would directly address the issue.

Rep. Eugene .Sa|oom (D-
Westmoreland) said his resolu-
tion would show that the Legis-
lature intends to allow the
embattled LCB to continue the
wholesale and retail sale of liquor
and wine. Such a step would al-
low the agency to begin ordering
merchandise for the Thanksgiving
and Christmas holidays, he said.

But Rep. Joseph Gladeck, R-
Montgomery, likened Saloom’s
introduction of the resolution to
”_spitting in the wind  I think if
you want to do something posi-
tive, you ought to come out with
a comprehensive bill.”

The fate of the liquor board is
uncertain because lawmakers
failed to extend its life during the
last session of the General Assem-
bly. That automatically set in mo-
tion a Sunset Law provision
requiring the board to phase out
operations by the end of June.

The only way the board can
continue beyond that point is if
-the House, Senate and governor
agree on legislation reauthorizing
the agency.

Saloom’s committee is tinker-
ing with several proposals, most
of which would allow the LCB to
continue marketing alcoholic
beverages but would place en-
forcement with the state police or

state attorney general.

Committee members added
two new twists during Tuesday's
meeting.

First, Rep. Thomas Tigue, D-
Luzerne, said he and a Lackawan-
na County Democrat, Gaynor
Cawley, were Considering legis-
lation that would reverse roles by
keeping enforcement under the
LCB but putting the Department
of Revenue or another state agen-
cy in charge ofisales.

Then Rep. " Terry Punt, R-
Franklin, said he was weighing an
amendment that would prohibit
the LCB or any other agency that
handles enforcement of the Li-
quor Code from closing a bar or
club that illegally allows patrons
to play punch boards or other
games of chance with prizes
worth less than $250:

Swim coach Fred Lewis

By Kelly Witt
For The Pitt News

When the University of Pitts-
burgh hosted the Big East_ swim-
ming and diving championships
this past weekend, Pitt's Jim
Emore became the first Big East
swimmer to qualify for the NCAA
championships.

Emore will travel to Austin,

Texas, to compete in the NCAA
championships, being held April
2-4. He qualified Friday night in
the 100-yard butterfly with a time
of 49.01, beating the qualifying
time by one one-hundredth of a
second.

When he first touched the wall
and looked up to see his time,
Emore didn't know he had quali-

fied because of a mistake on the

Wednesday, February 25, T987

Swimmer Emore set for NCAAs  

scoreboard. But then a friend told
him he had made the time he
needed.

’’I hitthe wall and didn't know
that I had qualified for" the
NCAAs,” Emore" explained.
’’Once I found out, I was so ex-
cited that all of the fatigue from
the race went away.”

Emore said he was surprised to
have done so well. He was still

trying to get over strep throat and,
until the actual time of the meet,
wasn't even sure if he was going
to be able to compete. Less than
a week before, he was .on antibi-
otics and wasn't allowed any-
where near the water.

’’It was the best feeling of 
swim career,” said Emore about C .

relief when he slammed it
down the chute?

”Winning,” said Pitt head
coach Paul Evans, whose Pan-
ther team had just platooned
their 23rd victory of the season
against the Villanova Wildcats
Monday 94-83 to make their

record now stand 23-5 and
12-3 in the Big East. ”Winning

is the name of the game this

year.” V

But somehow, there seemed
to be something else.

Amid the celebrity and

glory, another side of Pitt~

basketball shone through —
rivalry. Unfortunately, though,
this rivalry, which is usually
defined in good-spiritedness,
turned a little sour Monday
night. “ '

Amid many shouts and
taunts, Wildcat star forward
Doug West played what may
have been the hardest game
he ever had. Not because of
the Panther team, per se, but

' because of the Panther fans.

Evans offered to control the
moment.

, ’’I walked over tohim and
asked him i.f he wantedme to

get on the [public address sys-
tem] and ask [the crowd] to
knock it off,” said Evans. ”But
I told him if he thought it
would make it worse, I
wouldn't. He declined the
gesture.” _

‘'1 think he's a nice kid,”
Evans added.

Whatever the case, despite
the jeers, or even perhaps in
spite of them, West performed
-quite impressively with 23
points.

But this wasn't impressive
enough to topple the Panthers. '

”We won, and we won
good,” said Jerome Lane, who
fed his ever-growing No. 1-in-
the-nation leading rebounder
total with 17 more and scored

_ 20 points as well. ”They

played hard against us, but we
came right back at them. Now
it's St. John's and on to the
tournament.” *

The Panthers need a victory
at St. John's in order to secure
their first-place status and to

get the top seed going into the ’

Big East Tournament. They
also can do this if they finish
in a first-place tie with Syra-
cuse (10-4).

A However, if-Pitt finishes-in
a three—way tie with Syracuse
and Georgetown (10-4), they
will be seeded second, giving
Georgetown the advantage, E
because the Hoyas _ have
defeated the Panthers and the
Orangemen each time they
have played both teams during
the regular season.

But there is at least one Pan-
ther player who is looking be-
yond even the Big East.

”Right..now, the talk is final
four,” said point guard Mike
Goodson, who had 18 points
and shot‘,four for nine on
3-point field goals. ”We think
we can go.”

Offensively, the Panthers‘
may have the power to make
this a valid statement. In Mon-
day's game, Charles Smith
looked tremendous, scoring
22 points and power-grabbing
“10 rebounds past the search-

ing *-hands of’ the /Cats. .

Charles Smith goes up for two of his team-high 22 points against Viilanova.

However, some team mem-
bers and Evans as well feel the
defense still needs some im-
proving.

”Our defense is still weak,”
said Lane. ”Their score should
not have been that high, and
they especially should not
have been able to get as many
3-point shots as they did. It's
bad to say, but if we don't get
it all together, we may have
trouble getting past the third
game [in the Big East Tour-
nament]/’

This trouble in the defense
began to put.Pitt on thelhotseat

Wildcat guard Harold Jensen
began to turn on their powers
and really heat up Villanova’s
scoring drive. Jensen alone
made six for 10 on 3-pointers
and scored 26 points, the
highest in the game. During
the second half, the Wildcats E
scored 51 points total. .
With a littleless than 12
minutes left to play, things
seemed to be getting a little
out of hand, with a combina-
tion of poor officiating, wild
plays and un-needed fouls,

‘most of which worked against

the Panthers. Gore had fouls

Lane's head and into the
stands, and Smith almost had
his arm taken out of the sock-
et by Gary Massey.’ But after a
restitution dunk by Smith at
11:14, things began to simmer .
down, and the game regained _
relatively normal play.

”l’m glad we played a rela-
tively clean game,” said
Evans. ”Things got a little
harsh at times, but that was

mostly because of the at-. V

To cap the evening off, Emore at

of the meet. This _made his par-
ents, who were in attendance,
very proud.

”We were going to go home af-
ter Thursday's meet, but we're so

Emore and the -rest of the Pitt
men's team have another chance

to swim at their peaks two weeks A‘

the Eastern Seaboard Champion-
ships, March 5-7.

”The problem now is whether
to try to get Jim ready to do his
best times at Eastern Seaboards or
to wait for NCAAs,” said Lewis;

That's a problem many other
college swimmers wish they had.

THE pm NEWS, Wednesday, February 25, 1987  

Some call it an ugly, hateful‘

rivalry. Others prefer to see it as

nothing more than an intense bat- -

tle between two basketball teams
that play in the same league, both
of which are trying to get the up-
per hand in the fight for Big East
supremacy.

There has always been a cer-
tain animosity between the Pitt
Panthers and the Villanova Wild-
cats, And it goes back before the
days of the Big East. Pitt and Vil-
lanova were both members of the
Eastern 8 conference (now the At-
lantic 10) and had many physical,‘
brutal games back then. _

But that was the Eastern 8. This
is the Big East. In the Eastern 8
you're goal was.to get into the
NCAA tournament. Winning it is
the objective of the supreme
powers of the Big East.

The Panthers came into the Big
East five years ago with hopes of
becoming a Top 20 caliber pro-

gram. Meanwhile, Pitt's cross-_

state‘ rival, Villanova, was two
steps ahead of the Panthers and
wasting no time building a na-

,_ tionally recognized program of

their own. V ‘
The Wildcats joined the Big

_- East two years prior to the Pan-

thers, and they reached their peak
in 1985, winning the national
championship. ,

Many were proud of Villano-
va’s NCAA title. Others were en-
vious. Pitt definitely fit into the
”green” category.

The Wildcats’ title was a
reminder to the Panthers. A
reminder that someday soon they
too could reach that level.
_”Heck, we were in the Eastern 8
with ‘Nova. We used to beat the
Wildcats, and look where they're

V at/’_T_.hat’s what Panther fans h_a_d

to be saying when Villanova
defeated Georgetown in the title
game.

Pitt knew they weren't far be-
hind the Wildcats, even if it ap-
peared that way. Now, two years
later, the Panthers are head—and-
shoulders above Villanova.

_ I Pitt is headed for at leasta share

of the.Big East regular season ti-.
tle, while the Wildcats must win
the league's post-season tourna-
ment or they will find themselves
in that ever dreadful affair called
the NlT.

But don't tell Villanova coach
Rollie Massimino that. He
doesn't seem to like Pitt —— and
he probably never will. Massimi-
no has had his share of differ-
ences with Pitt through the years,
but the infamous Doug West in-
cident brought it all into the pub-
lic’s view. Death threats against
Massimino and West have been
a reminder that they will never
receive a warm welcome in or
around the city of Pittsburgh.

The fans at Fitzgerald Field
House on Monday night were

’ rowdy, but well behaved for the

most part. No incidents, no
problems, no pyschos, just col-
lege kids finding a way to release
tension and have fun. -

 

OHN
. ENRIGHT

 

Pitt coach Paul Evans didn't
necessarily agree. Evans pulled
West over in pre-game warmups
and had a talk with him. ’’I think
he's a nice kid, and I told him if
the fans really got on him I would
go to the [public address micro-
phone], but he said don't worry
about it.

’’I think their [Vil|anova’s] kids
are some of the classiest in the
league,” said Evans. ”Some peo-
ple have made [the rivalry] out to
be more than it is.”

Still, many view the Pitt-«

Villanovav game as a bitter feud.
Evans blames those problems on
the media, not the players. ”l

and it was filled with stories
about things that happenned two,
three years ago. The [players] are
far above that," said Evans, refer-

‘ring to.Monday’s edition of the
‘Pittsburgh ‘Post-Gazette.

Indeed, the players may’ be
above this, but the circumstances
are not. That was readily appar-
ent yesterday when Bobby Mar-
tin, a 6-9 power forward from
Atlantic City, N.J., announced
that he has changed his committ-
ment from Villanova to Pitt.

Martin, considered one of the
best high school players in the

country, gave Massimino a verbal P

committment back in December,
but he wasn't happy.with his
choice, so he decided on Pitt.
Monday afternoon Evans gave
Massimino the news. ’’I told Rol-
lie he was losing him. [Martin]
had made the wrong ‘decision.
His high school coach told us he
was unhappy with it.” '

Martin would have filled a glar-
ing hole in the Wildcats weak in-
side game. Now, he will add

-Recruit’s changeof heart heightens rivalry

depth to the Panthers potentially
awesome frontline of Smith,»Jer-

ome Lane, and high school All- .

American Brian Shorter. But
Shorter still must score 700 on his
SATs to be’ eligible next year.

Evans said Pitt stopped pursu- .

ing Martin after he made his origi-
nal committment to Villanova.
Whether Pitt did or not isn’t rele-
vant, although Massimino may
beg to differ. ._
The important point is that Mar-
tin’s decision is another dent in
a continually declining relation-
ship between these two schools.

Evans insists the rivalry has
been overblown by the fans and

the media. But the reality of the '

business-like structure and ”dog-
eat-dog” mentality of big-time
collegiate basketball and the in-
creasing number of off-the-court
differences between the two
schools, says there is definitely a
bitter rivalry brewing.

Bobby Martin made sure of it.

And Rollie Massimino would
probably agree. 8

Lane still cleaning the glass, but

laying bricks from the foul line

By John Enright
Sports Editor

Panther forward Jerome Lane
continues to be the nation's pre-
mier window cleaner, averaging
13.7 rebounds per game, but he's
been a master of masonry from
the foul line lately.

Lane has thrown a lot of bricks
in three of Pitt's last four games.
Against Boston College, Geor-
getown and Villanova, Lane was
16 of 35 from the line.

PANTHER

NOTEBOOK

’Tl’ve been struggling all year.
I just haven't been concentrat-
ing,” said Lane. Added Pitt coach
Paul Evans: ”When Jerome
makes his firstfew [foul shots], he
shoots them well, but when he
misses his first couple, he has a

tough time.”
* * *

Lane is once again the winner
of the Quote of the Week
Award. When asked why he
could manage only six second
half rebounds against Villanova

"on Monday night, ”Rome”

responded: ”Yeah, well in the se-
cond half, they were putting four
and five guys on me.”

Easy, Jerome.

definite possibility, but one needs

NEAR MAGEE HOSPITAL) ° OAKLAND,

By Thomas Danyluk .

‘ Sta ff Writer

With senior sharpshooter Cur-
tis Aiken .on the bench recover-
ing from a concussion, Paul
Evans needed an extra special
game from Michael ‘C-oodson.
Villanova’s tough backcourt had
to be countered. A A

Goodson answered with one of
his best outings of the year —— 18'
points (including four 3-pointers),
4 assists and merely one tur-
nover, all in 40 minutes of action.
lronman Mike hasn't taken a real
break all season. And he's getting
better every step of the way.

It seemed that Pitt.might be-
come a one-dimensional club in
Aiken’s absence. All those work-
horses inside, but no sheer threat
to hit the ”J” from downtown.
The Villanova defense, everyone
guessed, would collapse on
Charles Smith, Jerome Lane and
Rod Brookin and leave the out-
side as DMZ. Goodson ruined
that strategy.

’’In the last four or five games
I've been sticking from, way out.
My confidence is sky-high,”
Goodson ‘said. ”They were giving
me the outside shot for a lot of the
first half. Then they put that box-
and-one on me, which made
things a lot tougher.”

Villanova really had no choice.

1Goodson came out smoking,

pouring in 10 of Pitt's first 20
points. As soon as the defense ad-

‘ justed, the key parted like the Red

Sea, and the Panthers’ big men

were free to do their-~ share of V

strolling around.

”l’ve still got to work on not

forcing my shots,” Goodson ad-
ded. ’’I also have to start penetrat-
ing more, getting inside then

dishing off to the other guys.” '

For only the second time this
season, Goodson was forced into
action without his backco.urt
mate, Aiken. ’’I' really felt like
something was missing out
there,” Goodson explained.
”Anytime you lose a starter with
Curtis’ ability, you can definitely
feel the absence. Still, Demetreus
[Gore] played really well at the‘
two-guard, and [Pat] Cavanaugh
did a great job coming offithe
bench. Those two made my job
all the easier.”

Throughout much of the game,
Goodson was matched up
against a pal of his — guard Ken-
ny Wilson — whom he compet-
ed against frequently in high
school. ”Our two schools “[in

New Jersey] are only 15 or 20, .

miles apart. He's never beaten
my team, though, at least in
games I've played in. T

”This is something we'll talk
about all ‘summer at the
playgrounds. He doesn't like the
fact that I know his game,” Good-

five in the Big East in that
department.

Senior forward Jane Plake, the
only Lady Panther to start in all
27 games this season, contribut-
ed 11 points and four rebounds,
bringing her season average to
8.6 points per game.

Stand-out freshman guard Jen
Shingler leads the team in assists,
steals and free-throw percentage.
She is second on the team in to-

Shingler has been ranked as
high as 12th in the nation with

Providence, scoring only seven
points and turning the ball over
six times.

Providence had six players in
double figure scoring. The Big

ward Mary Burke collected 15 to
lead the Lady Friars.

Junior center Doreen Ferguson
added 13 pointsand eight re-

by freshman Andrea Mangum for

 Wrestlers end season with

By Vince Carey
Staff Writer

The Pitt wrestling team will try
to end the dual—meet season with
a win tonight against West Vir-
ginia at 7:30 in the Fitzgerald
Field House.

The Panthers are currently 1 1-4

‘overall and 2-4 in the Eastern
Wrestling League. West Virginia
is 10-5 and 2-3.

”This should be an interesting
match—up,” said Pitt head coach
Rande Stottlemyer. ”On paper
they might have the winning
edge, but we have a good shot at
taking them.”

There promises to be an excit-
ing match at the 150—pound divi-
sion tonight. Pitt's Gary Bolinwill

tell it will.

”There are a lot of people who
don't give Matt a chance here,
but I have confidence in him,”
said Stottlemyer. ‘'1 can see him
pulling the upset.

ing another key to a win,” he
continued. ”lf Allan can get us
some big points, it will really

Another good match—up is at
the 167-pound division. Here,
Pitt's Mike Tongel will square off
against Gordan Taylor. Both
wrestlers have the same type of
style, so it could go down to the
wire.

Pirates hoping Miller
will aid pitching staff

By Alan Robinson I
AP Sports Writer

BRADENTON, Fla. — General
Manager Syd Thrift says pitching
is the key to any success the 1987
Pittsburgh Pirates will enjoy. And

- the key to the Pirates’ pitching .

just as successful with the Pirates’

-young pitchers as he was with the .

Orioles’ veterans.
A ”I’m taking this as a personal
challenge,” Miller said Tuesday

I-at Pirate City. ’-’I had a chance to

"go _with an American League

_ team, one with a veteran staff. But

VIN knew that if_ I was successful
there, they'd say it was because

‘ the pitchers were supposed to

win.
”In Pittsburgh, the pitchers

’ have talent, but they‘re young 

they've never won in the big
leagues.”

Of the five Pirates likely to be
in the starting rotation when the
season opens, none had a win-
ning record last season.

The likely opening day starter,

veteran right-hander Rick Re-

uschel, was 9-16. Left‘-handers
Bob Kipper, 6-8; Bob Patterson,
2-3; right-handers Doug Drabek,
7-8 with the New York Yankees;
and Mike Bielecki, 6-11, were
also below .500. —

But Miller said none of his Ori-

Miller’s reputation as a one-
man college of
knowledge preceded him to
Bradenton. If he stops to give one
pitcher a tip or advice, two or
three’ other pitchers quickly

- gather around to listen in.

”If there's a better pitching in-
structor in all of baseball, I ha-
ven’t seen him,” Thrift said. ”He
is very detailed. Everything he
does is for a specific‘ reason.
There's no wasted time when
he's teaching.”

”I couldn't have been any hap-
pier when we got Ray Miller,”

. said Pirates managerjim Leyland.

”He is a quality teacher. I can't
imagine being able to get any-
body better.”
