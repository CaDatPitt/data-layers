The Future

In his midday speech Monday, Chancellor Wes-
ley Posvar related the University into the totalities
of the city of Pittsburgh and the whole American
Society.

“We are on the verge of a new age of public in-
volvement of the university,” according to Dr. Posvar.
In the future the “overshadowing dangers of nuclear
weapons will be met by an intensif'ied search for a
new international policy.”

On the national scene, “the American University
Will become dramatically more important.” In short,
the university of the future “will participate, guide,
and sometimes invent . . . changes,” said the Chan-
cellor.

Dr. Posvar indicated in his address that urban
universities in the nation will be playing an even
greater role in city affairs in the near future.

But What about the future of our University?
Will it fit into both the national and urban patterns
that Dr. Posvar predicted for the future? We believe
that it may. Extensive plans have been mapped out
by the University staff that reveal the necessary ex-
pansion of the University.

The administrative staff has planned new dormi-
tories to house the ever increasing number of students
that will be coming to the University. An expanded
Student Union is planned. Classroom shortages are
being looked into.

If these measures are followed through, the Uni-
versity will forge ahead and fit into the patterns of
the future. Members of faculty will actively partici-
pate in programs of national consequence. Students

. in the Graduate School of‘ Public and International

Affairs will provide a grea.t deal more research assist-
ance to the city of Pittsburgh.

All of these improvements of the future can be
Visualized in the plans that have been drawn up by
the University. But these plans don’t hold their
weight in light of the somber national situation that
we face today.

Part of this somber situation is the current draft
law. The new Selective Service-provisions have put a
sharp thorn into the side of all the universities in the
-nation. This is precisely why we must contend that
the draft, as it exists today, is the major problem
that may ultimately impede the sustained growth of‘
the University.

We demand that the draft law be reassessed and
revised. Any law that thwarts the heartbeat of the
future is one that should be discarded. The future of
the University is bright. But the future of the Uni-
versity in our future society is bleak if unrealistic
draft laws are maintained. The nation must let the
light of knowledge shine.

Snoopy at Helm

 

 

Shakeup In the Peanuts League

by MIKE BROURMAN

In a world where constant
change is the status quo,
there are few institutions
left on which Man can rely. Those
few which remain are cherished
as bastions against a sea of un-
Certainess; they are our “secur-
ity blankets” to clutch when all
else fails. A

Thus, when one of these “se-
curity blankets” is threatened
with destruction, the reaction
from the civilized community is
one of horror. As each thread is
torn from the blanket, the terror
increases.

Now, one of the most impor-
tant of all security blankets is in
dire danger, much to the dismay
of every red-blooded American
reader of the comic strips.

THROUGHOUT its long and
glorious history, the Peanuts base-
ball team has had that quality
which is devo-utly to be wished
nowadays-consistency. They are
the most consistent losers this

side of the New York Mets, and
have been for years.

Not even in the days of Marvel-
ous Marv Throneberry could the
Mets match ineptitude with the
Peanuts nine, losers of more than
1000 consecutive games.

Who could forget that glorious
day when Charlie Brown blew a
game by trying to steal home
with the team’s best hitter up,
and was thrown out by thirty
feet? These are the things that
made America great.

ALAS, NOW all of that won-
derful consistency has been
threatened by a ruthless new
force—-progress. Charlie Brown,
that marvelously inept manager,
has been dumped in place of
Snoopy, great fielding shortstop
and .400 hitter (when he’s not
out in his Sopwith Camel with
the precision mounted dual ma-
chineguns fired through an air-
screw).

And with Snoopy’s arrival, all
of the bumblingness that has en-
deared this diamond ninesome

(or, if you prefer, eightsome and
a dogsome) is threatened.

IT SEEMS that Snoopy will not
stand for less than perfection.
While Charlie Bro-wn cowered at
the thought of Lucy’s big mouth,
Snoopy merely kicks her. It
seems as if those long, cruel days
tramping through France after
his fateful encounter with the
Red Baron have hardened this
once cuddly hound.

Evidently, on his travels
through France Snoopy acquired
some of the characteristics of
that great master of subtlety,
Charles de Gaulle.

FORTUNATELY, Snoopy’s
dastardly behavior has not yet
allowed the Peanuts nine to break
its losing spell. But, it seems only
a matter of time until Snoopy’s
disciplining foot kicks them out
of the losing column.

When that happens, another se-
curity blanket, that vanishing
American, will be torn asunder.
Now, if ‘Charlie Brown ever gets
a Valentine!

Do — It — Yourself Time Tunnel

by MARC SIMON

I hate eight-o'clock classes.
Eight o'clock classes ought to be
banned, or at least picketed. But
who wants to get up that early to
picket them? '

The’main problem with eight-
o’clock classes is that one has to
get up too early in the morning
for them. Therefore, one doesn't
get enough sleep. Therefore, one
is tired the whole day. There-
fore, I would like to propose a
method of getting more rest and
satisfaction from sleep. My meth-
od may help you combat the atro-
city of the eight-o’clock class.

LET’S USE you as an example.
Say you usually get up at seven-
thirty for your eight-o’clock class.
The night before this class, set
your alarm for seven-thirty as
usual, but turn the time on your
clock ahead one half hour.

When (and if) you wake up
the next day, your alarm clock
will read seven-thirty, but it’s
really only seven. Knowing this,
you can joyfully sink back into
bed for an extra half hour, get
up_at eight (according to your
C10Ck) for your eight-o’c1o~ck
class, and still not be late,

But after a while you may get
used to having just an extra half

hour, and find that you’re still
tired. Therefore, you should set
your clock ahead a full hour;
thus, when you wake up at seven-
thirty, it will really only be six-
thirty——you’ve gained an hour’s
sleep. '

SOON YOU’LL be setting your
clock ahead three or four hours,
waking up at three-thirty a.m. (if
you’ve gone to sleep by that
time), and prais-ing the fact that
you really have four hours of
sleep left, and can go to your
eight-o’c10.ck class at twelve-
thirty (your time).

But, let it be admitted that this

method of gaining sleep requires
some precaution.

(Using this method, I once
showed up for a history quiz at
four a.m.).

THIS PROCEDURE can be pro-
jected evenfarther. Why, you can
set your clock ahead a full day;
for instance, when you wake up
on Wednesday you realize it’s

only Tuesday, and on Tuesday

you don’t have any classes. Or
you might set your clock ahead
two days on Friday, wake up
Saturday, think it’s Monday, and
then happily discover that it’s
really the middle of the week.

Your clock ahead three months,
think it’s September, start pack-
mg for school, and then celebrate
the fact that it’s actually only the

the livin’ is easy. ’

ALL THIS TIME saving, I as-
Sure YOU, has been practiced in
the past and is still practiced to-
day, on the international level.
However, there is a slight varia-
tion; the clocks are set backward
instead of forward. For example

ran for President, and set his
fllock back to 1870. One of his
