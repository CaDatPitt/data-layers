Splish Splash

 

A slight mishap occurred in the’

end.

It seems that one of the carefree
photographers neglected to shut
off the water when shutting up
shop for the weekend.

Now you might say, “Doesn't
the darkroom sink have a drain?"
The answer, of course, is “Yes.”
The whole place is one large
drain.

But this weekend, more than
usual, things were sloshing" around
the cameraman headquarters. For
the rubber hose carrying water
to the drain sprung a leak from
the excess of pressure allowing
about one-third of the water to
fall upon the realms of Fine Arts.

Now the sound was quite
‘aesthetic as the water dripped,

dropped, sloshed, through the sev- '

The William Pitt Debating Union, under the direction
of Dr. Robert Newman and Miss Mary Roberts, has announc-
ed a broad program for the 1958-59 debate season.

It’s international program will receive increased emphasis

because of the foreign travels of Richard Mattern, president,

Newman attended a convention in
Brussels and did research on cross
examination techniques in the
English courts. -

baters are planned to McGill Uni-
versity in Montreal and the Uni-
versity of Toronto. The highlight
of the year will be a return visit
to the British University of the

ciprocate by sending Oxford to
debate with Pitt at the Student
Union on Oct. 23.

The ﬁrst series of public debates
will begin with the University of
Minnesota on Oct. 15, 16, and 17.
The topic of the debates is “Re-
solved: The United States should
adopt the essential features of the
Russian system of education.”

45 High School Debates

Other teams in the series are
Northwestern, West Point, and
Notre Dame. The series will take
45 debates to local high schools
and a total audience of 30,000 peo-
ple. _ - "

The Union will sponsor this
year the 11th annual Pitt Cross-
Exam Tournament, the Western
Pennsylvania High School Clinic,
and the spring college novice
tournament.

“Face the People,” a discussion
show over television s t a t i o n
WQED, will be resumed "on Wed-
nesday evenings at 9 p.m. begin-
ning Oct. 8.

The Union has begun scheduling
its service club series which takes

Only Dietzgen Slide "Rules
have these great features

Professional engineers say Dietzgen's new slide rule:
embody the greatest advances in design in more than
a quarter century. Dietzgen's exclusive Micromatic
Adiustment permits perfect alignment of the scales at _
all times. Simple resetting of one screw does it. The
end plates need not be loosened; fit and action ofthe

slide is never disturbed.

Dietzgen's automatic slide tension insures perfect
slide action wherever and whenever these rules are
used. Slides cannot bind or stick_—nor become loose
so errors may result from accidental slide movement.
These are truly great slide rules. Important new scales
added. New super-safe carrying case. See them at

  Trimester Buemeblingi

The announcement ofthe bare skeleton of speciﬁc in-
formation about how the trimester plan will take effect is
particularly signiﬁcant at this time. _

The people most affected by the announcement are be-
ginning their collegiate careers today. These -are the fresh-
man students in the Schools of Liberal Arts, Engineering
and Mines, Pharmacy, and Nursing V L h .

For them the trimester choice will come next Septem-
ber. All the other undergraduates presently in the Univer-
sity, if they ﬁnish their studies in the normal four,-year span,

‘will not be affected.

The present Sophomores will be able to complete their
senior year in April instead of June but will not'be present
for the advent of the Spring Trimester (April to August,

A The- announcement concerning the tentative imple-
mentation in the graduate and professional schools by Sep-
tember, 1961 is a more rapid transition than many had con-
templated. ,

' _The hurdles. toearly utilization of trimesters in the pro-
-fessional schools are many. Antiquated laws still exist con-
cerning the weeks per semester ortotal years to be devoted

to professional schooling for licensure in certain professions.- ‘

Further it is unlikely that the professional schools, fac-
ulty and student body alike, will be anxious to switch to an

"11-month program when the rigors and pressures. of the pro-

fessional school schedule are such that some now. cannot
physically stand up to it.

A brochure to the faculty on trimesters is to be sent
out soon. This perhaps will be more enlightening on what

: is in store.

Some students were completely baffled by the an-
nouncement last spring thatthe trimester program would be

A instituted in 1959.

They mistakenly assumed that the whole undergradu-

 ate student population would be permitted to enroll for the
j trimester program‘-an_d some present sophomores and jun- ’
V iors planned accordingly. \ . ’

Again, in a way, a publicity bumblinggon the ‘part of

e the administration is evidenced. They were trying last year

_.to ready things too fast and thus be ﬁrstin the race among
Universities for trimester establishment.
Thus they had to publish prematurely the sole fac

A that trimesters would be initiated in 1959. ‘

“Slow and easy’-wins the race” is often more truth" than

be developed to the fullest extent by the Russian

propaganda organ.

We occasionally criticize the white Africans for

the extension of their policy of
Apartheid; we blandly, ‘teach
Lincoln’s message in our grade
school history courses: ‘‘All men
are created equal.”

However, our own socio—eco-
nomic “separators” soon come
into_play making a shambles of
equality of opportunity. This is
particularly true in the perilous
case of the‘Negro ‘in America
today. ~
lJnamercanism- by Americans

We seem to be faced with the unamerican tactic
practiced by so-called good Americans of saying
one thing while doing something quite the opposite.

Walter rWhite, a Negro who doesn’t look like a
Negro (he’s white-skinned with blond-hair and blue
'eyes)’wrote what I consider one of the most
blistering condemnations of the American treat-

ment of the Negro.

ﬁThe superb blend of hypocrisy and lies spew-
ing from the mouths of some Americans must
make the citizen of Ghana glad he’s there.

White wrote in his autobriography a portion
describing a mob attack on his home: "‘I knew
then who I was. I was colored, a h man being
with an invisible pigmentation which marked me a
person to be hunted, hanged, abused, discriminated
against, keptiin poverty and ignorance, in order
that those whose skin was white would have
readily at hand a proof of their superiority.”

While A Nation Slept. . .

By David Breakstone

I believe it was Sir Walter
Raleigh who warned against re-
cording and commenting on con-
temporary history. “If you fol-
low too closely on the heels of
history, she
may rear up
and kick your
teeth out,” the
English hero
once acidly
remarked.

Later
torians, pro-
fessional and
p art - time,
have foun d
more than a
particle of truth in sthat observa-

his-

 

. tion born of experience. For in

the mill of human experience,
that. which seems signiﬁcant at

.. the moment often proves to be
trivial at a time-distance which
affords perspective.

The taskof determining what
is really important is more diffi-
cult now, when the complexities
of atomic industrial society ac-
celerate the rate of change. In
one day a score of seemingly im-
portant events occur which
might have required a week to
develop twenty years ago. There-
fore, if the contemporary ob-
server speaks ,at all, it is only
after much serious consideration.

Having so provided‘ a sturdy
argument against doing it, I will
now speak out about what I
consider a disastrous summer.
Disastrous Series

The disaster was the series of
setbacks suffered by our country
in the playing of the cold war
and the two internal affairs
which shook- our -nation’s moral

 
 

foundations’: These events appear :-
:.;mo\v.;:tdha ~ .eaching:.eﬂec-ts

 

On the international scene, the
pot began to boil over on Bas-
tille Day, July -14. The army re-
voltiin Iraq, the dispatching of
American troops to Lebanon and
British troops to Jordan, and the

reconvening of the U. N. Secur-
ity Council all happened in the
space of 72 hours.

Before our troops had pitched
camp on the hot shores‘ of the
Middle East, we were charging
“international communism” with
indirect aggression in_ Lebanon,
and in return the United Arab
Republic, with Russia, accused
the west of ﬂagrant interfer-
ence, aggression and imperialism.
. What appeared for two weeks
to be the start of a. general war
gradually subsided into vicious
name-calling and a decision to
let the U. N. ‘.‘investigate” the

problem. The only winner in the -

“brink” situation was Gamal
Nasser, who emerged as a saber-

‘rattler of fearful proportions.

Then, the early August ren-
dezvous between Krushchev and
Mao Tse-tung previewed the re-
newed Red bombardment of the
Nationalist-claimed islands of
Quemoy and Matsu in the For-
mosan Straits. The Communists
have pushed up into a now—fa-
miliar corner. The only apparent
way for the U. S. to avoid some
kind of open warfare is to re-
pudiate in part our strange en-
tanglement with Chiang Kai-
shek.

Formosan Climax A

The Formosan situation is
coming to a climax rapidly and
swift decisions are now being

H _made which could turn the tide

either way in the ﬁnal analysis.

But how can we, as.so-called good Americans,

ing those who need a crutch.

.

A The Frighteniing Summeri     

Southern Agony 

The South’s agonizing struggle
with its integration conscience
continued during the summer
and into the fall. Seemingly,_the
only people publicly on ‘the
Negroes’ side were the Supreme
Court justices. The schoolsare
closed in Little Rock and, may
soon be in parts of Virginia. As
one cartoonist put it, “Mr.’Faub-
us wants everyone to be ig-'-‘
norant.” - .

Asshocking asvthese events
were, the most disturbing aspect
of the nightmarish drama was
the’ audience’s lack of reaction.
The citizens of this country were
silent, even blind, to the shatter-

’ ing events of the summer.

Abroad we were poised on the
edge'of a catastrophic war. At
home our very morality was
crumbling away. But there was
scarcely a sound from the peo-
ple. ~

Even the American students
who are supposed to be keenly-
sensitive to injustice and govern-
mental laxity went abouttheir
business unimpressed. (Those
who did care shrugged their
shoulders characteristically.) .

The spell of national apathy
and indifference, bred in high
places, now appears ‘to "be com-
pletely cast. Existencecould rest

Jungle Cats’ Winged T '
Ready F or.Holy Cross  

 

_ By LARRY HAGGERTY _
Local football fans will get their ﬁrst chance to see Coach
John Michelosen’s new offense in action on Saturday when

the Panthers encounter Holy

Cross. The opening kickoff at

the Stadium is set for 1:30 p.m. _ _
After last season’s disappointing 4-6 record, Michelosen
recognized the need to revise his offense in order to build up

the player’s morale and at the

I same time break up the nine-man

lines that the Panthers kept look-
ing at last year.
 answer was a winged T
with an end split wide on the op-
posite side from the wing back,
orvright halfback, the idea being
to spread the defense thin and
constantly threaten it with the
pass.

year’s line being smaller than last
year’s, but the Blue and Gold

of last season averaged 218 pounds

from end to end.

This year the ﬁrst string line
averages 213, the second string-
ers, 2l6, while the third string-
ers average 214 pounds per man.
Plenty of beef is still available.

According to no less an author-
ity than Right I-Ialfback Joe
Scisly, who “ran better against
UCLA than he does against the
Panthers’ second team in scrim-
mages,” the Skyscraper U. second

stringers are ‘not to be taken
lightly. ’
Two Units Even _

“I think our second team,”
Scisly said, “is better than UCLA.
There is hardly any spread be-
tween our ﬁrst two units. They’re
pretty even.”

The Panthers will probably
need both of their strong teams
against Holy Cross in the home
opener. The Crusaders have one
of the best long ball throwers
in college football in Tom
Greene, who makes every playa
possible touchdown.

Assistant trainer Roger McGi1l
reports that the Jungle Cats will
be at full strength on Saturday.
The only “casualties of the ﬁrst
game were Ken Montanari and
Andy Sepsi. Montanari has been
slowed down due to a twisted hip
while Sepsi required several
stitches to close a cut mouth.

Toncic or Kaliden? _

The only doubtful starting spot
in the lineup for the tilt with the
Crusaders is the‘ quarterback
position. As of now it is a tossup
between Ivan Toncic and Bill
Kaliden. Toncic may get the call
because of his excellent showing
last week. ‘

PICTURED above is the Panther ﬁrst string which already has one victory under its belt and goes for
another this Saturday. The line, 1.-r., is Art Gob, Bill_Lindner, Ed Michaels, Don Crafton, Jon Guzik,
Ken Montanari, and Jim Zanos. The backs are Joe Scisly, Fred Riddle, Bill Kaliden, and Dick Haley.

This game is the ﬁrst of the sea-

the team should be a strong one.

He is a quadruple threat in that
he passes, runs, plays defense, and
kicks in All—American style. The
halfbacks are both strong hard
runners, and Ed Hayes and John

should prove a good challenge to

Yogis Try for Another Poor Week)

  

     
 

The football season is going into
its second full week of games, but
don’t anyone tell The Pitt News
Yogis. They think the schools are
playing checkers this year. Or at
least that’s the way it seems off
the records of the ﬁrst week of
guessing.

The only selector who managed
to keep his head above the sod
was .Publicity Man Carroll

among the flunkies when Coach
John (No Towel for Me This

As a result of Cook’s showing
(8-7), Mike managed to get lost
again this week and Carroll is
back to prove that last week was
honestly a fluke. In honor of the
esteemed All-American maker,
this week’s Game of the Weak is
Carroll vs. Elmhurst. . ,

And, naturally, Carroll (the
man) has selected Carroll (the
team). All the other Yogis have

Do your emotions ever lead you to do

Do_ you try to plan ahead rather than
make snap judgment decisions"?

If your roommate suddenly inherited a
million dollars, are you sure your
relationship would remain the same?-,

Can you honestly say you pay more
attention to political issues than to
the personalities of the candidates?
