UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Undergraduate Student’s
Compact Laser, Allows
Precise Measurement

by ANNE DORN

A University undergraduate,
«Paul Irgang, has developed a
unique industrial laser than can
measure precise distances in
space “to a ha.irbreadth." It is
the first laser of its size that is
able to measure distance

Irgang, a chemistry 
maj-or, noted that the
compactness of his las-
er is “practicall be-
cause it’s mobile.” It’s
a 50 watt, and could
even be carried aboard
-ship. His new indus-
trial laser is a far cry
from most lasers,
which take up a whole

  

Laser stands for light a:mrpliﬁ-
cation through stimulated ermi-
tion of radiation. Irgang com-
pared the laser principle to the
waves created in a pool. When
a rock is dropped from a plat-
torm above the pool, it creates
waves that travel to the other
side. When the waves hit the
other side of the pool, they
bounce back. If another rock
can be dropped at the exact
same second that the wave re-
turns underneath the -platforrn,
the waves will be intensiﬁed.
The laser beam functions on this
principle. In the case of Irgang’-s

Jlaser, the water is argon in an

excited state, and the rocks are
mirrors, since they reﬂect light.

The laser has already illicited
the interest of several compa-
nies since its industrial poten-
tialities are attractive. Irgang
mentioned that the beam would
be used to move earth, to cut
down forests, to drill for mining,
and to disintegrate any material
known to man.

Another possibility for the las-
er beam is in space, stated Ir-

Develops new lazer

gang. His laser beam was orig-
inally designed as a measuring
device, but he didn’t realize the
distances it could reach. Even-
tually, he added, it may be used
for interplanetary communica-
tion.
Irgang developed the new
 method in Clapp Hall,
with the entire phy-
sics department help-
ing and making sug-
gestions. To make the
laser compact, he
, , ground mirrors to
 such a size that he
was able to decrease
the angles at which
the photons bounced
off each other. Algain
using the analogy of a swim-
-ming pool, he stated that it
would «be like dropping rocks
into the smaller women’s pool
at ’I‘~rees Hall, instead of -the
Olympic pool.

Final S.G. Senate Meeting
Resolves NSA Cotroversy

SENATORS CAMPBELL and Weiss read over NSA Bill.

Flack Opposes Morgenthau

Power Does Not Hurt Intellectuals

 

Photo by David Saz
DR. NHCHAEL FLACK

Disputes M orgenthau

   

“Simply because an intellectual such as Dean Rusk or Walt
Rostow leaves the college campus to serve in Washington should
not necessarily mean that his intentions should be suspected.” This
view that “power does not corrupt,” which fundamentally opposes
that of Dr. Hans J. Mcorgesnthau, was advanced Wednesday by Dr.
Michael J. Flack, director, Department of International Affairs at
the University, r

In November, Hans Morgenathau gave a Speech titled “The
Role of the Academic in Government and Society.” Dr. Morgen-
thau focused on the behavior of the intellectuals and ﬁound what
he felt was large scale voluntary betrayal especially with respect
to the war in Vietnam.

Dr. Flack, not expressing his own opinion on the Vietnam ques-
tion, took issue with Dr. Morgenthsaws underlying diagnosis of the
role of the intellectu-ails as a class in society.

Asserting that Dr. Morgenthau’s views were a product of the
intellectual environment in Europe in the 1930's, Dr. Flack de-
nounced what he felt were Dr. Morgenthau’s basic assumptions.
“That man is basically evil and
power hungry; that social man
is fundamentally the adversary
of the intellectual; that intellec-
tuals feel that if they can’t gain
the acceptance of their views
by mass society they feel that
they have failed in their calling;
that therefore it is in the pub-
lic interest that the intellectuals
keep watch.”

Dr. Flack countered: “Here
and now to be an intellectual
connotes a quality -of mind rather
than a status, class, or quality.
The public mind is therefore
part‘ of a coordinate rather than
a subordinate debate.” He seem-
ed in favor o-f spreading the in-
tellectual function throughout
all of -the members of a society.

Oi-ting Wail-ter Lippmanls view
that “ten social sciences, since
they deal with conduct, must
rest on a positive assumption of
human behavior.” Dr. Flack
went even deeper than his dis-
agreement with Dr. Morge-nthau
on the role of the intellectual.
“Dr. Morgenthau’s negative
views on human nature which
comprise his belief in a ‘Real-
pollitik’ are about as far away
from a positive assumption of
behavior as it is possible to get.”

By po-sing the question, “What
would Dr. M-orgenthau do as
Secretary of State?” Dr. Flack
tried to show that different opin-
ions can be acconunodated by
the same truth.

'l‘he ﬁ.rs«t ﬁre in the long his-
tory of Holland Hall (south)
was quickly put out by city ﬁre-
men Wednesday afternoon. Due
to the quick response of the
ﬁre department, the damage to
room 640-A was neglsigible.

After an eyewitness observa-
tion, this reporter, noticed that
Holland 640-A was slightly dam-
aged. One wall was sornewhat
charred but the room will be re-
painted within the week, accord-
ing to Mrs. Gene Terrence, head
resident of Holland Hall (soutlh).

Meanwhile, the residents of
640-A, Miss Gwenn Strickland
and Miss Marlene Cane have
moved into a new room. Miss
Strickland said that a number of
her books were burned and that
some of her cosmetics were
destroyed.

Mrs. Terrence noted that the
persons who discovered the fire
did not utilize the fire alarm on
the sixth floor. “They came
down to the first floor to ring
the alarm."

The ﬂre was discovered when
a number of sixth ﬂoor resi-
dents noticed s-moke coming out
from under the door.

The hall of parliamentary
debate echoed with the re-
sounding pleas of senator.
ial opinion when the mem-
bers of the Student Govern-
ment (SG) Senate rejected
National Student Association

(NSA) affiliation and forw!agrd- .

ed their opinions regarding the
problems confronting SG at
Wednesday evenings ﬁnal SG
meeting.

The original vote count on the
NSA controversy was nine to

eight in favor of afflilisation. SIG‘

Vice- president Tom Meiassner,
however, used the right of the
chairman of the Senate to vote.
This action created a tie vote,
insuring the defeat of the pro-
posal,

After the meeting, Senator
Loren Hershey stated to The
Pitt News that Meissner’s action
wa s illegal. Hershey charged
that “Roberts Rules of Order
stipulate that the chairman of
a ‘body can only break a tie and
not create one. Thus the vice-
pres-ident’s move was illegal.

But this ﬁnal SIG meeting was
more than a debate session over
the pros and cons of NSA-it

was a ﬁnal opportunity for out i
going senators to state their .

views regarding SG. » -

The lack of imaginative lead-
ership was the central theme of
Senator Gabby Edwards’ re-
marks. “The new Senate must
make a criticle evlalluation in or-
der to do something construc-
tive. There hasn't been imagina-
tive leadership this year.”

Student rights and a uniﬁed
student viewpoint were the two
key points of Loren Hershey's
address. “We are students and
we have rights to certain things.
But here the students ﬁt into
the pattern of administrative pa-
terntalism-—th'e reasonable, unet-
fective approach to student prob-
lems and rights.”

Senator Jon Meyers said that
“there is no excitement in SG
for we have lost sight of the
issues; we have lost face in our
dealings with the administra-
tion.”

“The regional nature of this
campus is a dilemma that must
be resolved by SG,” said Sena-
tor Ken Weiss. “The students
are tired of a spineless SG.”

SG Vice-president Tom Meiss-
ner stated that “SG has achieved
something this year. But the
executive was forced to carry
out its function without the aid
of the Senate.

Senator Vic Willem received
a-n ovation for his warning to
the new Senate. “I have heard
comments stating that the new
Senate is incompetent and that
it is not composed of capable
persons. 'Ilhe.se are serious ac-
cusations but you must rise to
the occasion and disprove them."

Tim Buckley Comes Through with New Album

into a vortex of poetic images
from which it’s impossible to
return unchanged.

In this whirpool of vision are
found such peoples as Mammon.
the false god of riches and
greed; Pisces, the personiﬁed
ﬁsh constellation; juggling
clowns; stony people and love
the magician. In a world where
values are false and love a sin,
“humans weep at human dea.th_/
all the talkers lose their breath.”
Buckley paints a picture of a

“I Never Asked To Be Your
Mountain,” Buckley is bitterly
confused over his feelings for a
girl, at one moment deeply in
love and at the next not at all
sure. The song ends with a last
desperate plea — “Please don’t
leave me/Again this way/ Please
come home.”

The failure of tradition to
have meaning has turned those
people into stone who still cling
to the past. In “Pleasant Street”
Buckley would have us believe

of the Hobo who has stopped in
front of his “ﬂeeting house” to
“wound (his) door and jeer.”
The Hobo passes by with “No
more tails of time” and cursed

Not since the Beatles Sgt. Pep-
per’s has a work of this magni-
tube been so successfully com-
pleted and with such emphasis
on artistry and presentation.
Buckley and Beckett have pro-
duced a masterpiece.

Popular Myths about Dreams

by BARBARA MARKOWITZ

Dr. Glenn Miller, profes-
sor of clinical psychology
at the University, stressed
the fact that everyone

dreams and disproved many
popular myths about dreaming
in his lecture Wednesday night
at the YM&WI-IA. The lecture,
“AdVances in ElectroP1lysiologic-
al Techniques,” is one of a ser-
ies through which Dr. Miller
hopes to communicate the re-
wards and challenges of research
into human dreaming.

Dr. Miller began his lecture by
tracing dream research from 1896
when Ladd introspectively decid-
ed that while he slept, his eyes
moved. In 1956, research on sleep
showed by measuring the charac-
teristic rhythms in different parts
of the head that a person sleeps
in four stages. Research also

' showed that during the first stage

of sleep the sleeper’s eyes actual-
ly move «rapidly. Through mea-
suring the rapid eye movements
(REM) of a sleeper, researchers
could tell when the subject was
dreaming.

According to Dr. Miller, the
popular belie-f that dreams last
only a fraction of a second is a
myth. Research using the REM

method and slackness of muscle
tone, another measure of dream-
ing, shows that dreams usually
occur during 20% of all sleep
time and comprise 7% of the life
of the average individual.

Dr. Miller said that everyone
dreams, and that even those who
claim that they never dream
spend the same amont of time in
Stage I as those who remem-
ber their dreams. He substan-
tiated this claim by stating
that through experimentation it
can be proven that even monkeys
dream.

In comparing actual dreams to
dream reports, Dr. Miller stated
that a large gap, exists between
the actual dream and the report-
ed dream due to repression and
distortions through time. He la-
mented this fact, saying that psy-
choanalystis could make use of
the actual dream, rather than re-
lying on the patients report.

According to Dr. Miller, the
function of the dream is to ful-
fill the Freudian concept of oral
needs. He stated that this theory
has been proven by experiments
where, when deprived of dream-

ing, subjects began eating more.
He said that the increased eating
was a direct function of loss of
dream time, because eating sat-
isﬁed oral needs lost through
dream deprivation.

However, he warned that the
experiments are not completely
valid since it is impossible to
totally deprive a person of dreams
without keeping him awake.

D r e a m deprivation, according
to Dr. Miller, has different ef-
fects on different people. He the-
orized that the effect is a func-
tion of either personality adjust-
ment or physiology. He stressed
the importance of dreaming by
stating that drastic personality
changes occur when the individ-
ual is deprived of dreaming for
an extended period of time.

Editorial: The Time for Results

This past Student Government (SG) campaign raised the vital
question of whether SG should exist at all. Over one thousand students
voted to have it abolished entirely, and any student who cast a ballot
for one of the three contenders voted for a candidate who felt that
SG should definitely be revamped.

In light’ of the negative reaction to SG, it was interesting to ob-
serve the final remarks delivered by members of‘ the 1967-68 Senate
at Wednesday’s meeting. None of these students ran for re-election,
except the two who ran for president and vice-president of SG respec-
tively, George Doperak and Frank Tutino. This is a rare phenomenon,
for obviously all of this year’s senators are not graduating seniors.

The decision of so many senators not to seek re-election is a
highly significant reflection of futility. Their f'utility cannot be dis-
missed as easily as the sense of futility experienced by those who do
not choose to participate in extracurricular activities. For the outgoing

senators did choose to serve by the very fact that they ran for the

Senate and by the time and energy put forth by several of them.

There was a consensus among those senators who spoke that
they failed. Some called for more imaginitive leadership and the need
to make an evaluation of‘ what student needs are in light of their
capacities as senators. One termed SG as “spineless.” No senator ap-
plauded the performance of SG during the past year.

To those who criticized, we quote this pas.t.year’s senator from
the School of Pharmacy George Doperak: “Criticism is nothing with-
out solutions.” It is easy and often important to strike out against
the status quo. That seems to be the approach of every candidate who

runs for SG. There is a definite value that cannot be denied in critic-
ally evaluating SG and its effectiveness in any given year. But all too
often this criticism is in vain because it is not effectively utilized. Stu-
dents lash out against incumbents, failing to grasp that this in itself
has no value; what is vital is to perceive not only that people failed,
but why they failed. A record of achievements is but a mere outline.
It cannot register the countless disappointments that faced students
and the many obstacles confronting them in their drive to achieve.
Our activities are important, but they are extracurricular. We are
handicapped by the very fact that we are students and cannot devote
all of the time we know is needed to ensure the success for which we
ideally strive. Our part-time capacities can never be forgotten, for
that status explains why success is often a painfully slow process.
The limited hours we have to. devote to activities does not preclude
achievement, however: it only means that achievement will not come
as rapidly.

In light of the obstacles before us and the difficulty of our tasks,
we caution the senators who classified this year’s SG as a failure to
not judge so harshly, unless they can supply the elusive solutions to
the perennial dilemma facing SG. Criticism can be overemphasized;
what is really important is going beyond the surface and trying to
discover why there were only limited results. ,

We have heard enough platitudes to last a lifetime——lwe now ask
this new.SG to give us not only an agenda for action but a fulfillment
of that agenda. Only then will they have proved that they have learned
from the valuable criticism given by this year’s Senate: only then will
they have really achieved.

No Mean Task

A Message to SC}

by Beth Lazerick

Mr. Schueler, Mr. Tutino, worthy senators, Student
Government (SG) : Over 50% of the voting student body
at the University of Pittsburgh does not want you in office,
Mr. President and Mr. Vice-President. Almost 50% of the
voting student body does not even want SG around! So
what does this mean to you? \

Does this mean that you have a challenge greater than
any ever given to SG on this campus before? Yes, it does.
And just what are you going to do about it? The Positive
Action Team will have to really be a team and it will have
to be a big enough group, (and I do not mean in size) to
work with the senators who are not affiliated with that
group.

In the past, or so it has appeared, opponents were
never able to forsake their own prides for the good of this
University. You cannot afford to let this happen again,

' or next year people with ideas of abandoning SG will

sweep into office. “Remember what happened l-ast year,”
they will say, and they will be right.

Dear senators, what are you going to do this year?
Are you going to contribute to the general disinterest or
are you going to actively participate in the governing of
this student body? Will the senators from The College,
the Schools of Education, Pharmacy, and Engineering
attend the Cabinet meeting of their respective Schools?
Some of this year’s senators have not even done this. Why,
we could ask, did they accept their positions in the ﬁrst
place?

And why, some ask, should we even bother with doing
anything for the University? For so-me students this is a
seriously considered question. For many of the students,
as Well as faculty and administration, a glance around
this campus can answer this inquiry: Look at the Hillman
Library. At last we have a place worthy of study and
learning. No longer do we have to squint because the light
is so poor, and no longer do we have to fight the antiquated
closed stacks. Knowledge has been uncovered for us! Look
at the Student Union. Now students have a place to meet
besides the,Towers Lobby. Pool tables, game tables, and
lounge chairs have transformed the sterile Schenley Hall
into a real Student Union. Eating in the Schenley Cafe-
teria can even be a pleasant experience, in spite of Saga’s
occasional lapses.

At this time, though, the thing that should give every-
one the greatest incentive to work with and for this Uni-
versity is the example being set for us by our four con-
testants on the General Electric College Bowl. Win or lose
this coming week, these four have unveiled a new image of
this University in the eyes of those who had begun to doubt
the school i'n which they are enrolled, in which their chil-
dren are enrolled, or simply the school that is in Oakland
“but that I would not want my child to attend.” Not only
do the SG officers and senators have a responsibility to
maintain the momentum we now have, but they also have
a duty to encourage everyone else to look at their Uni-
versity with a feeling of pride.

This is no mean task, Mr. -Schueler, but it 1's.your_sL
the--tinie.-togsytart.

 

  

Letters to the Editor

Belly Urges
SG Support

Editor, The Pitt News:

On Thursday of this week K-en
Schueler was inaugurated pres-
ident of Student Government
(SG). He will be assuming of-
ﬁce in a very difficult s-ituatio-n.
He is a minority president. He
will be leading [an org-anization
Whose very existence was called
into question in the recent elec-
tion.

As the leader of the “Aboli-
tion of SG Movement” and one
of the candidates who opposed
Mr. Schueler in the recent elec-
tion, I would like to offer several
ObSeI‘V1atlO1‘lS concerning the
tasks which lay before the pres-
ident-elect and the task-s which
face those who feel that SG is
inhezrrently inadequate.

First, I would suggest that all
students have the responsibility
of aiding Mr. Schueler. He
should be given the opp-ortunity
to develop l'lJlS ideans a.nd the op-
portunity to put his ideas into
action. He h-as entered the office
of president of SG with an en-
thusiasm which, I must admit,
rivals all previous administra-
tions. In one short week, he
has spoken with a variety o-f
faculty, students and adminis-
trators in an attempt to devel-
op courses of action to meet a
wide variety of problems. All of
u.s should do whatever is pos-
sible to make his admiinistra-
tion successful. He has prom-
ised to rise above the petty po-
litics' which has rendered SG
inoperatdve. We, those who call-
ed attention to the problem,
should make the same promise.

Second, however, I would cau-
tion «Mr. Schueler. All too often
capable student leaders enter
SG with the best of intentions
but are trapped by the trivia,
such as Homecoming and Win-
ter Weekend, and ignore the
real problem facing the student
b'od~y—-«the quality of education
on this campus. I hope that Mr.
Schueler will be able to over-
come this problem; I fear that

‘he will not.

In the next few months. the

-1?ut~urre~of SG will -decided;  »

Mmsehugier is nperhepsi  most

capable individual to enter the
office of president of SG in re-
cent years. If he fail-s to do a
good job; if he fails to rise
above petty politics; if he fails
to concern himself with impor-
tant educational matters he will
have demonstrated the inade-
quacy of SG —— and next year
SIG will most ce-rtaiinily be abol-
ished. '

Student Blasts
Apathy Column

Editor, The Pitt News:

In the Jan. 25 edition Olf The
Pitt News your editorial assis-
tant, Dan Lichenst-ein, wrote a
column “The Gre-at God Apa-
thy.’f I would like to register
my disgust with th-e type of
rep-ulsive journ-allisim. I a-m
equally shocked that a “poor
loser” should ‘be permitted to
express himself in The Pitt
News in surc-h an undiagniﬁed
manner.

Both PAT and USA parties
made an honest effort during
their campaigns. An honest ef-
fort to accomplish something
which is worth much more than
an editorial pen to arouse dis-
content. Had the USA party not
been in the election, Mr. Belly
may have scored the larger
number of votes. But those peo-
ple who had supported abolition
would have soon become sorry.
For people tend to vwant to abol-
ish What they don't understand.

That rone-thuird page article to
which I am referring could have
served a much better purpose if
it had been used constructively
to inform those students about
Student Government or to ana-

lyze the election results impar-
tiailly.
May I also add that I believe

anirnousity of the editorial staff ’

will never help to strengthen
Student Government, especially
now at this vital time. Student
Government needs everyone’s
support. Crirticism comes easy.

I include my C0‘nlgIl3»tu1altli‘0'n‘S

to Mr. Schueller and Mr. Doper-i"

ak on a ﬁne campaign. I regret
that they were targets of edi-
torial attack, but I assure them
that this University i:s ﬁlled with
vaippreciativ-e people, not just
noble name-callers. i

Recent Elections
Editor, The Pitt News:

This recent an-d entesrprising -

appeal for the abolition of the
Student Government, I ﬁnd, does
a peculiar injustice to the sub-
tle Workings of the student
mind; -and this injustice, I feel,
can only lead to behavioral dif-
ﬁculties later t-o become acknow-
ledged as something beyond the
limits of toleration. One does
not after all take away the toys
that keep children out of the
hair of the adult populat:i-on.
How else can a ch-ild respond to
the burning down of doll houses
than to put matches in the shoes
of the preceding generations?
These friable minds of spine-
less children! How else can one
keep them soft, pliiablle and
mushy for future American dis-
solution than to saturate them
now with water-logged illusions?

ial Intimacy Discussed

Pittsburgh-ChicagoNewUrbanArea

“Good solutions create good
problems, excellent s 01 u ti o n s
create fantastic problems,” when
trying to resolve dilemmas of
modern city life, stated Bertram
Gross, ptrofessor of political sci-
ence at Syracuse University.
The doctor spoke on “Urban Liv-
ing: the Problem of Special In-
timacy an-d Territortiaiity” Wed-
nesday at the YM and WI-IA.

Prof. Gross considered Pitts-
burgh in the year 2000 when it
will be the eastern boundary of
a huge urban area reaching to
Chicago. This urban complex
will be one of several metropolit-
an groups which will include

over 80 per cent of the popula-
tion.

The “CHI-PITS” concept shows
the spreading urban territory in
the future.

But, Prof. Gross pointed out,
the “CHI-PITS” idea is already
out of date. “Today dimentions
are in space-time, rather than
space-territory.” The urban com-
plexes will be as close as mere
neighborhoods because modern
methods of communication will
draw them closer together and
will create the McLuhan “global
village.”

He eliaborarted on this McLu-
han idea. As the education of

people increases they are con-
cerned less with their immedi-
ate territorial community and
more with organizational and
educational communities which
are not bounded by territory,
but rather, are global.

Dr. Gross believes that the
concept of mental health should
be altered from an individual
standpoint to include urban
health—the political, social, and
economic factors which affect
all of u:s. “There are all sorts
of inlterreliaitionslhips between
these aspects of health. Drrr
the word menrtall, it is not ne
sary for today.”

The Judgement

by Jay Rosenstein
Sports Editor

M_A_4n4AAAhAAA.A4AnA4A_

‘ plainingf

Behind the Pitt bench at the Field House, a tight-

lipped vendor wonders around, making a half—hearted ef- ‘

fort to entice people to buy his popcorn. He spots a few
fans sprinkled in the section and struggles up the steps to
their seats. He sells a few boxes, runs out of customers,
and heads back down the steps.

Near the spot where the vendor turned around, Frank
Carver is intently watching Pitt play basketball. But now,
much more than in past years, Carver’s eyes are directed
to the man in the dark blazer who sits on the bench, his
coach and friend, Bob Timmons.

Once again, the Pitt Athletic Director finds himself
in a situation he dreads. It was only a little more than
two years ago that Carver was forced to fire a good friend,
a solid coach, and an expert strategist. John Michelosen
couldn’t recruit football players anymore, Carver reluct-
antly admitted at the time, so we had to make a change.

Bob Timmons has never been able to recruit basketball
players. He failed to recruit after the winning years of 1962-
64. He has failed to attract any ballplayer taller than 6’7”
to come to Pitt. In college basketball, that fact alone should
be grounds for dismissal.

But Carver knows that the situation i's more complex.
He realizes that Timmons has virtually no interested alum-
ni who can help him recruit talented ballplayers. He recog-
nizes that the physical plant cannot compete with those
of major “basketball” schools. He also knows that basket-
ball interest in the student body and the city nowhere
equals the interest in football.

And what makes the situation even more agonizing
for Carver is that the Athletic Department has never pro-
vided any impetus for the basketball program. Some say
that Carver is afraid of big-time basketball because of the
possibility of a major scandal which would ruin the sport
in the East, and irreparably damage Pitt’s reputation.
Thus nothing would hurt Carver more than to fire Tim-
mons, if he knew that the coach was only a scapegoat.

On the other hand, Timmons may be the major cause
of Pitt’s ineptness in basketball. Forthe past three years,
this writer hasn’t seen it that way, but two former Pitt
Sports Editors have. ,

American went to Farrel High School, about 90 miles from

Coach Bob Timmons . . . on the bench.

Pittsburgh. Marin’s father wanted to see his son play
basketball close to home, and always insisted to Zelkowitz
that Pitt was J ack’s first choice. However, Timmons over-
slept on the day he was to show Pitt to the Marins, and
the following day conceded Jack to Duke. Mr. Marin, how-
ever claimed that had Timmons called his home, the coach
would have had an excellent chance of getting his son.
Zelkowitz considered Timmons “a lousy salesman”
but never questioned his coaching ability. Last year, how-
ever, Tom Sacks was extremely critical of Timmons the
coach, as well as Timmons the recruiter. Sacks often wrote
on the lack of‘ enthusiasm and aggressiveness in Panther

basketball and he faulted Timmons for it. Sacks demanded‘

that Timmons be fired, asking “how can you have a good
team when you have a coach who has publicly admitted
that he hates to recruit?”

'There’s no question. that the majority of the interested
student body would like to see a young, eager face sitting
on the Pitt bench. Frank Carver has an obligation to them
to announce either a vote of confidence. for Timmons, ex-

Salter Sets

For Phila. 

Invitational

Over and over and over

again, high-jumper Bryant 
Salter goes through his daily P 
practice, striving for perfection. H .2;

Salter, a freshman, competes ,' 
in the Philadelphia Track C]:as- 2' ’

sic tomorrow. He was invited

after he set the school high-jump _« I 
record (6-8) at Navy in the open- 

irng frosh meet.

Since then, Stalter has had 
ﬁculties with the event which he   ‘Y

reached at the state ﬁnals at

Pittsburgh's South Hills I-Bi.-gh 

School.
Because of the high jump

area’s location in the Field “j

House, “I change my steps every

day in practice,” Salter explain-- it
_ ed. Since his record jump, Salter 2 
has jumped only 6-4 in two frosh , » 

home meets.
There could be some big names
in the Philly meet,‘ and it 

be Saalt-er’s ﬁrst invitational 
meet. ‘There is the big meet 'l
in New York on the following-

weekend,” noted the tall fresh-
man, “and a few out the big

names might be in Philly to 

warm up.”

Salter also said he would have-5 ‘ 

to change his approach again
for the meet, but feels it will
help him. “The longer runway
allows me to speed-up my ap-
proach, without lessening my

steps,” Salter said, just beﬁore,  l;

he attempted a practice jump.
Then Salter looked up from

the pit, saw the bar

place, and smiled.

Cats Claw Defenseless Tartans,  
But Rams Have Sharper Horns

by MIKE BROUR-MAN
After breezing to an 89-46 route of Carnegie-Mellon
last night, the Panthers meet someone their own size to-
morrow when they oppose the tough Fordham Rams in New

York.

Carnegie-Mellon must have -patterned its offense [after the
Egyptian army, for they were about as successful, scoring 14
points in -the ﬁrst h.-alf while the ‘cagers drilled in 43 to break open

the game.

As unaccustomed as he is to
a 29 point lead, coach Bob Tim-
mons _ knew what to do about
it, substituting liberally and
pulling his team out -of the zone
press that had devastated the
Tartans in the ﬁrst half.

Meanwhile, the Panthers came
back after their terrible (26 per
cent) shooting night Tuesday
against Miami of Ohio to hit 50
per cent against the outmanned
visitors. Reserve guard Bob Pe-
trini, seeing his most action in
three weeks, led the cagers with
22 points. Petrini hit eight of 12
from the ﬁeld, mostly long
jumpers.

Actually, Petrini had replaced
the Panthers’ hottest shooter in
the lineup. Pete Smith, playing
just over 20 minutes, hit six of
seven from the ﬁeld, including
a driving left-handed hook shot,
and ﬁnished with 14 points.
Smith also contributed three re-
bounds and a number of steals.

Rob McFarland, who ha.s been
the team’s most consistent ball-
player over the last month, had
another ﬁne game with seven of
11 ﬁeld goals and 15 points. Mc-
Farland also grabbed seven re-
bounds.

But the Panthers’ top rebound-
er was reserve center Pa-111 Nap-

onick. Playing the last 15 min-_

utes, he pickedotf 12, while mus-

cling his way in for. 10 points. .

With the Ranthers leading by’

-the Pitt fans in the crowd be-

time since they started college.
But Timmons ellectedto play it
safe and not inﬂame feelings,
since the Panthers meet the Tar-
tans again -this season.

He won’t have to worry about
keeping the score down against
Fordham. “They’re quick,” Tim-
mons commented. “They use a
lot of pressure on defense, and
they jam up the inside once you
penetrate. You don’t get much
in close against them. .. 

“They’re a lot like Miami of
Ohio,” he continued. “You have
to be able to hit that 14 or 15
foot jump shot on them. to be in
the game.” The Ranthers failed
to hit that shot against Miami
but hit it against CMU. Satur-

Sloppy Cubs

Even Record,  

Win, 65-59

Last night at the Field House, —l
the freshman cagens proved they
were agile athiletes. The Cubs 
beat the Carnegie-Mellon JV, 65- ~-
59, and in doing so they dis-H . ,
played a «great deal of portentisal 1

in soccer and volleyball.

'Ilhe Cubs opposed a 

team and had every right to ex-

pect an easy win. But the Car? V
negie-Mellon JVS, aided «by the 1 *

numerous Cub turnovers, stay-

ed within reach throughout -the 2

game.

The game appeared to be the A
sloppiest performance of the
young season for the Cubs. But.

at least -they made the game in-
teresting by using turnovers to
«keep the score down.

Bad passes, lost vollies, and
booting the ball dominated the
action. However, Tom Withers

managed 17 points before he

fouled out to grab scoring hon-

ors. Teammate Mike Caldwell.-

contributed 15.

The Oubs evened their record
at three wins and three tosses.‘

With-out Bob -Gailus, the Cubs“
have been unimpressive in the 2

last two games. (Geilus (6-6)_is

The last time Bob Longo saw
Texas he was in Hershey, Pennsyl-
vania. It was his senior year of high
school, and Bob caught a TD pass to help
the Keystone Big 33 team beat the Texans
in the anual all-star game.

Texas wasn’t too fond of Longo then,
but the next time he grabs a touchdown
aerial there will be cheers in the Lone
Star state because Tuesday night Bob was
drafted by the Houston Oilers of the AFL.

“I feel very good about it,” Bob said.
“I won't kid you, I wanted to go to the

“ rm Io — THE PI'I'l‘ NEWS — Friday, February 2, 1968

Longo Delighted With Texas In His Future

NFL, but if I had to go to the AFL then
I’m glad it was Houston. They're a win-
ner, and they're in Texas. And they do
things big in Texas.”

Last year Houston won the Eastern
Division of the AFL, and they did it with
the league's best ground attack and worst
aerial game. The Oiler front office felt
that the weakness was in the wide receiv-
ers and, as Longo said, “they told me they
need help and that I’ll have a really good
chance to play this year.”

Drafted in the fifth round, Longo was

actually the Oilers’ fourth pick (they had
no first round pick). In addition, Houston
took two other ends in the early rounds,
including Jim Beirne, a teammate of Bob’s
on the Big 33 team.

Beirne and Longo have often been com-
pared, but Bob doesn’t fear the competi-
tion for a starting spot. “I’ve been shoot-
ing my mouth off for two years about
being with a bad team. Now I’m with a
good one, and I'll have to prove myself.”

The other ends whom Bob feels he is
the equal of, John Wright and Jim Cox,

went before him in the draft. “I’m happy
for them,” he said. “As I said, I haven't
done anything, and I had that tailor-made
excuse. I guess I’ll just have to show them
what I can do.”

Longo and the Oilers havenlt discussed
terms yet. “Charlie Bradshaw, a former
Steeler, is representing me,” Longo said,

I “and he operates right out of Houston. He

told me not to agree to anything, that he’ll
handle everything. I guess I’ll just Sign
the contract he works out.”—by BROUR-

Mermen Battle Terps’ Undefeated Temple’s Gym Set-Up ‘
PotentialAll-Americans, Boosts Neiger’s Hope For Future
Swim Marks May Fall

by ART ROSENGARTEN
Carrying a 2-4 record, following a big win over Penn

State, the varsity swimming team faces a powerful Mary-

land squad tomorrow at 2:00 p.m. at Trees Pool.

What looks on paper to be an invincible foe for the mermen, may
not turn out to be a strong team in the flesh. According to assistant
coach Jerry Snyder, a good deal of Maryland's depth will be left

behind at College Park.
“Maryland is a member of the

.Atlantic Coast Conference which

permits freshmen athletes to com-
pete in varsity meets,” explain-

‘ ed Snyder, “but Pitt follows the

ECAC’s policy that no freshmen
can compete in any varsity meet.

If a team uses freshmen, then

Pitt will drop them from its fu-
ture schedules.”
Even without the freshmen,

_Maryland appears to be a swim-

ming power. ‘They were a real
solid team last year, and they
have always been known for
their depth in the past,” ‘noted
Snyder.,“They will be bringing
with them a group of potential
All-Americans.”

The status of one of these Terp
All-Americans, Phil D en k 0 v i t z,
will probably be in doubt right
up until meet time. “Denkovitz
was an All-American two years
ago, “explains Snyder,f’ and then
sat out a semester last year. We
won't know whether or not he’ll

be swimming against us until we

see their roster.”

Doug Springer, another highly
touted Terp swimmer, will defin-
itely be in the lineup, and that
spells trouble for the mermen.
“Springer has already done a 200-
yard breaststroke six seconds
faster than any varsity swimmer.

“Springer should push Chris
Price to his best time of the year
and it looks like the 200-yard
breaststroke record will fall Sat-
urday,” said Snyder.

Behind these two All-Americans
is another top swimmer in Wayne
Paulovski. He is the leading sprin-
ter on the team, and has gone
under 50 seconds many times in
the 100-yard event.

Bob Heim, who has gone under
11 minutes for the 1000-yard free-
style, and John Hill, who goes
2:07 for the 200-yard butterfly,
are two other top Maryland swim-
mers. “The race between Hill and
Howie Norris is the butterfly
should be the most exciting race
of the meet; a possible record
may be set,” said Snyder.

Temple University, one of
the top gymnastic squads in
the East, comes to Trees
Hall tomorrow. The Temple Owls,
coached by Carl Patterson, are
undefeated in six meets this year.
They compete against a team
which has won only one match,
despite some outstanding indi-
vidual performers.

“Temple has a lot of depth,”
commented coach Warren Neiger.
“They have specialists on many
of their events.”

Some of Temple’s top perform-
ers include Barry Weiner, who
will give Dave Shidemantle some

Pete DeFurio, who has served

a 9.1 on still rings, and a 9.15
on parallel bars. Jay Geist is the
Owls’ top trampoline man with
an 8.1 average. He can also score
a 9.4 on the high bar.

Dave Rosenberg, a 9.2 star on

are other Temple stars.

The Owls, finishing third in the
have beaten

“Looking at the Temple team
gives me encouragement for the

future,” said coach Neiger. “Their
greatest strength lies in numbers.
They have twelve returning let-
termen and a 22-man squad. Tem-
ple has poor practicing facilities
in its gym yet its coach is able
to recruit mainy athletes.”

We will have more money for
next year’s recruiting and I hope
I can get just as large a team,”
remarked Neiger.

Three weeks ago, vars-
ity wrestling coach Dave
Adams returned “home” to
Navy for a meet with the Mid-
shipmen. Unfortunately, his mat-
men didn’t fare too well against
the squad he once helped coach.

Tomorrow it’s assistant coach
Bob Fehrs’ homecoming at Mich-
gan, where both the Varsity and
freshmen visit the Wolverines.
Fehrs was a three-time NCAA
runner-up for Michigan.

“I’m sure he’d like to knock
them off,” said Adams about his
assistant, “but it’s going to be
rough.

ed. “They haven’t lived up to
that, but you know they have to

have something out there to be

rated like that before the sea-
son. .

“I’d say they are deﬁnitely in
the to-p ten,” he added.

Last season, the Wolverines
bombed the grapplers, 30-3. The
cnly varsity winner was Al
Traunsteiner, and he’s gone.
Bruce Unangst, undefeated at
123, probably has the best chance,
wrestling against a Michigan
weak point left by Fehrs’ grad-
uatrion. Elsewhere, the matmen
are in trouble.

“Lou Hudson, a sophomore at
130, has already beaten the na-
tional champion,” elaborated
Adams. Stehman at ' 152 was
fourth in the nationals last year
and Pete Cornell at 177 was
third in the nationals at 167.”

Issues of “Alienation and
Identity” is the topic of an
All-University Symposium,
which began yesterday at
Carnegie-Mellon University.
The series will continue
through March.

The symposium, open to stu-
dents‘ from all Pittsburgh col-
lege campuses, is aimed at en-
couraging thought and discus-
sion on students’ critical sense
of uneasyness about themselves
and about American society.

The All-University Symposium
is sponsored by C-MU’s Commit-
tee on Reli-giou-s Aifai-rs. Thom-
as A. Huif, coordinator of reli-
gious affairs and YMCA execu-
tive, is directing the series.

“The lecture is will examine the

 causes and manifestations of

alienation and apathy,” Huff
said. “They will consider the
fragmented, impersonal posture
of our society; and suggests pos-
sible models and methods that
enable a meaningful search for
identity.”

Other sessions scheduled Feb-
ruary are:

:> “The Storm All About Us,”
alienation in contemporary pop-
ular music;-Feb. 12 at 9 p.m. in

" ‘the Highlander Room at Skibo.

The session will feature 10-
cal musician and "music teacher
Paul DeBor; Ted Schuech, direc-
tor of Pittsburgh’s coffee house
“The Place”; and Bill Weiser,
co-pastor of the Lutheran Uni-
versity Center.
