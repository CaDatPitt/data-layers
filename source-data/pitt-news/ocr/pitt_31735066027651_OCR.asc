Buckley comments on   candidates

By Jim Rowe
For The Pitt News

Before a sold-out crowd
last night at the Carnegie
Music Hall, William F.
Buckley Jr. plugged his
newest novel, took a few jabs
at liberal politicians and in
the process made Jason
Smith’s night.

Smith, a student at Geneva
College, travelled to the
Carnegie with seven of his
classmates to hear what
Buckley had to say. They
were all in agreemenththat
they got their money’s worth.

“His main emphasis. tonight

was not political. He focused

more on his literature, which

I liked,” Smith said. “It was

very entertaining.”

Much of Buckley’s discus-

sion focused on his new book _

“Brothers No More.” At one
point he read to theaudience
the first few chapters. The
audience, in response,
seemed to hang on his every
word, hearing them as they
rolled from the author’s lips,
sounding exactly the way
Buckley so intended.

He drew laughter from the
crowd when he concluded his
reading, encouraging every-
one to take a look at

FBI doesn ’t want to let go

By Julian Neiser
Senior Staff Writer

The FBI met the Sept. 15
deadline to file an appeal
concerning a Freedom of
Information Act lawsuit filed
by a Pitt graduate student.

Though the agency met its
deadline for appeal, the Third

_ Circuit Court hasgnogt ruled

whether it will ‘allow the case
to be heard again.

Until then, Pitt graduate
student Eric Davin will con-
tinue his decade-long wait for

Help...

FBI archived documents
about the Workers Alliance of
America, a 1930s era work-
ers’ group and their leader,
David Lasser. He needs the

"papers for his dissertation.

“We knew they were going
to appeal,” Davin said. “This
is going to be such a big
defeat for them that they had

no choice.’.’. ..», «-

agency almost five years ago

Trudi Dunlap, also from
Geneva College, agreed that
Buckley’s presentation was
well worth the trip.

“I’ve seen him on TV and,
of course, read The National
Review,” she said, but added
that it was nice to see and

SGB plans projects
By Niczlre Walz ’

°Buckley, page 3

The Student Government Board is continuing successful
projects from the spring and developing new ideas for the
fall semester.

“We are finishing out our terms actively and not passive-
ly, because it’s not lame duck season,” said SGB president
Julie Crowell. '

One of the ideas from last spring is the SGB call-in talk_
show that seemedtobe ‘a big hit with students "last year. On
the night of its debut, the lines were kept busy for almost
the entire hour, and SGB member John Capriotti is hopeful
that it will have the same results this year.

“It got a great response last year, more than I thought it
would. I would like to get a couple more board members
there for the show,” he said. The show is expected to begin
soon, once details have been finalized with the school radio
station, WPTS.

The talk show is designed for students to call in with
their complaints and concerns to the SGB members. The
board is hoping that the studentstake advantage of this

‘ opportunity. In the past, numerous topics have been brought

up, ranging from complaints about the food to concerns
about safety.

SGB has been addressing the safety issue by implement-
ing an escort service. At Florida State University, which
currently uses the service, administrators claim not a single
student has been harmed while using the service. FSU’s
service hires students to escort other students around cam-
pus. There are five student guards a night, 40 trips per
night.

SGB has been mulling the project over for the past year.
working out the kinks with the budget and seeing if Pitt stu-
dents would be interested in using a similar type of service.

“We are working on the finalization of the escort service.
[We can expect it] to start, optimistically, in the first two
weeks of January,” said Crowell.

Student Health offers HIV testing, counseling

By Jackie Duggan
Asst. News Editor

Students go to Student Health
Services when theypfeel run down or
sick, but many may not know they can
go to get tested for HIV. It’s completely
confidential, it can answer a lot of
questions a student may have and it’s
free. It’s covered by the $46 student
health fee included in tuition. ' ‘

“We do about 150 HIV tests a year,”

said Kandy Miller, clinic manager of
the health services. “It’s not really com-
mon for a bunch of reasons.”

Miller said she feels one of these rea-
sons is that students don’t think they
are at risk. Often she hears students say
they use protection except when they
are with their boy/girl friend.

“The more partners you have, the
more you are at risk,” Miller said. “Too
many times students make decisions
based on emotion rather than fact.”

According to Miller, a university the

size of Pitt has about 60 people on cam-
pus who are HIV positive. This is based
on a study conducted by the Center for
Disease Control about four years ago.

Telling a student they are HIV posi-
tive is not a pleasant experience.

“It’s_ one of the most difficult things I
have ever done.” Miller said.

Every time a student goes to health
services for a routine exam or a gyne-
cological appointment. they are given a
blood test for syphilis. Culture tests are

U.S. asks Bosnian gov't. to use restraint

@ World Events

BOSNIA ——- The White House
joined others in the international
arena yesterday by urging an end
to the Bosnian Moslem and Croat
offensive so that peace efforts
could move ahead.

The United States has urged all ,

parties involved, including the

»- Bosnian government, to exercise

restraint and not to take advantage
of the changing situation on the
ground.

NATO has given the Serbs until
tomorrow to complete their

ISRAEL — Although both sides
hoped to come to an agreement
this week, Israel Foreign Minister
Shimon Peres armounced yester-
day that Israel and the PLO
expected to miss Thursday’s tar-
get date for a signing ceremony in
Washington.

White House officials say it
does not consider the delay a set-
back due to the difﬁculties" faced

' by both parties.

Israel’s concern for the 400
Jewish settlers surrounded by
more than 100,000 Arabs has
held up a deal to redeploy its

them, but only temporarily. —-

Sunday’s elections, the first in

Davin’s research. A recent victory at
the Third Circuit Court in Philadelphia
forced the FBI into the Sept. 15 appeal

deadline.

If the EBI had not appealed, over
10,000 documents would have been

released to Davin.

The FBI’s appeal requested that the

case be re—heard in front of
Third Circuit Court judges.

Buckley_._

0 °From page 1

Following his presentation,
a question—and-answer peri-
od allowed the audience to
stray from Buckley the nov-
elist to Buckley the conserv-
ative founder of The‘
National Review, columnist
and political talk show host.

One participant asked, “In
10 words or less, can you
assess Bill Clinton’s presi-
dency?” '

“No,” was Buckley’s
immediate response.

He did elaborate, saying, “I
don’t think anybody really
believes there is a body of
thought by which [Clinton]
is guided. There is a sense
that he never had a mooring. _

“This does not mean that
he won’t be -re-elected,”
Buckley said. “You can’t
underestimate the folly of the
people.”

Buckley was also asked to
comment on the possible
candidacy of Colin Powell.

“I would love to see a
black president,” Buckley
said, but he added that he
was hesitant as to what qual-
ifications the Gulf War gave
him beyond name and face
recognition. _ .

Referring to another war
leader-turned-president,
Buckley noted that “at least
Mr. Eisenhower was in Paris
[during his campaign] and
didn’t have to answer ques-
tions every five minutes.”

Buckley’s appearance was
sponsored by the Three
Rivers Lecture Series, chris-
tening its fifth season.
Upcoming speakers include
horror writer Stephen King,
and Kazuo Ishiguro, whose
novel “The Remains of the
Day” was turned a movie

and was nominated for seven _

Academy Awards.

If this appeal is not allowed, the
FBI still has the option of appealing to
the United States Supreme Court.
Davin said the FBI’s defense attorney
Michael Ivory was removed from the
case following the last defeat, and a
new attorney from the Department of
Justice will be taking over.
No information was given by the cir-
cuit court as to whether the appeal will
be allowed or not.

As far as the food service improvements,
Crowell has been working with Councilman
Bob O’Connor, the owner of Roy Rogers in the
Cathedral of Learning and Bobby O’s on
Forbes Avenue. Both establishments accept
choice dollars, and O’Connor is interested in
renovations. .

Crowell said, “He’s interested in what the
students want, and he is wondering if we need
to go in a new direction.” More meetings about
the renovations will be held in October.

also run for gonorrhea and chlamydia.

An HIV test is a separate visit in
which the student receives one-on-
one counseling. At that time the stu-
dent’s risk for the disease is assessed,
and the state requires that a consent
form be signed.

“We think it is important the student
understands the results and confiden-
tiality of the test,” Miller said.

All of the possibilities are discussed
with the student. - "

“I try to see how the student will
handlethe results,” she said. “I ask
them what will they do if the results
are positive. Do they have someone to
help them?”

If the results are negative, Miller
said, she makes sure students
understand prevention, so they don’t
ever have to visit the same situation
again.

“Sometimes students think they are
at risk when they are not,” Miller
said. “There is a lot of fear that sur-
rounds HIV.” —

Another reason why students may
not go to student health is because
they use the screening process just
before donating blood as a testing
facility.

“We encourage students not to do
this,” said Miller. “You are notified if
you have HIV, but it can’t be done in

  
 
  

    
       
     

a supportive way.”

An HIV test is also not completely
accurate, since positive results some-
times don‘t show up until six months
after contraction of the virus.

“If a person feels they have recently
been infected, we make them wait a
minimum of six weeks before test-
ing,” Miller said. “Then they are test-
ed again, six months after [possible]
infection.”

At student health, the student also
has the comfort of knowing the test is
absolutely confidential. The blood
work is sent to the lab with only a
code number, and Miller said she per-
sonally takes the results and matches
them with the name.

“Nobody knows,” she said. “Not
the chancellor, the dean or your par-
ents.”

The results take one week, and the
student is required to come back in
person. If the results are positive,
Miller tries to help the student with
their options.

One option, and something the stu- I

dent health fee includes, is a -pre—paid
visit to Pittsburgh AIDS Center for
Treatment. This is a multi—discipli-
nary treatment center. '

“It has an extensive work-up of
psychologists, lawyers and doctors
designed to give the best follow
through,” Miller said.

 Opinions  
J -O-K-E (look it up)

You might have thought that cartoons like the ones on this
page were sarcastic. You may have thought they were cyni-
cal, or maybe a little bit funny. But did you ever think they
were a threat? Did you ever take them seriously enough to
react (or overreact)? Well, apparently there are some people
who take satirical cartoons very seriously.

According to the Daily Nebraskan, the student newspaper
for the University of Nebraska, sports writers fromthe paper
are no longer allowed to attend football practices or to be in
the locker room. Why? What grievous offense did they com-
mit to incur such a harsh penalty? No, they did not steal any-
thing from the locker rooms or distract the players during
practice. Their crime was much, much worse.

The sports writers’ crime was writing for their campus
newspaper. The Daily Nebraskan dared to run two editorial
cartoons on its opinions page which were directed at the
school’s football team. (One of the cartoons showed a foot-
ball player driving a new car with money flying out of the
back seat.) These two cartoons were considered so offensive
that national championship-winning coach Tom Osborne felt
it necessary to ban the paper’s writers. The writers, then,
were guilty by default. .

First of all, Osborne needs to learn how to take criticism.
He has been placed in the national spotlight, and every bit of
coverage will not be positive. He should have no reason to
believe that he or his team is exempt from criticism. Just as
the Cornhuskers are able to bask in the limelight of being a
national championship team, they should be able to take the
criticism. He wouldn’t dare to ban Sports Illustrated from
his locker room for making a negative comment, and the
school paper should be given the same respect.

Osborne also exceeded his role by trying to dictate what
the press can and cannot say about him or his team. Though
his action was not necessarily illegal (since he is not an
agent of the government), it is wrong for a person to use his
or her position to determine what is printed in the newspa-
per. Freedom of the press is a powerful thing, and Osborne
may have done himself more harm than good by trying to
control the paper. _

The opinions page of a newspaper. like this one, does not
claim to print fact. Instead, it prints the ideas of the individ-
uals who work for that paper. Osborne is naive to think that
he can control what another person thinks or says by ban-
ning writers from practices. Also, the opinions page and the
sports page are two entirely different things. Osborne is try- ‘
ing to punish the sports writers for something they had noth-
ing to do with. j

Finally, Osborne needs to learn how to take a joke. The
offending cartoon was just that — A CARTOON! If a satiri-
cal cartoon can cause that much trouble, one has to wonder
how much truth might be behind the message.

Who really ca res anyway?

f you are at
all familiar
with liberal
rhetoric, then you
have certainly heard the notion
that liberals care more. The
Democratic party is the party
of the “big-hearted and

Matt

unselfish.” However, when it .

comes right down to it, they
don’t care nearly as much as
conservatives. Liberals may
care more about people‘ who
should be caring for them-
selves, but the real measure of
how much one cares is politi-
cal participation.

‘ Every now and then, I have
been known to engage in polit-
ical arguments with “con—
cerned” Democrats. These are
often people who are influ-
enced by professors who have
lived in ivory towers their
wholelives. Such people hear
bits of information from the
liberal media and then formu-
late many of their views. I
usually ask these concerned
souls, “Did you vote in the last
election?” I am then met with
the response, “Well, uh, I’m
not registered,” or “I didn’t
want to go home to vote, but
that doesn’t mean I don’t care
about politics.” Such answers
give me an immediate advan-
tage in the argument. (In case
you were wondering, I mailed
my straight Republican ticket
back to Texas in the (1994 elec-
tion.) _

Political apathy, particularly
on the part of liberals, per-
vades the Pitt campus. In a
recent edition of The Pitt
News, a survey indicated that
freshmen favored Clinton
nearly 2 to 1 over Bob Dole. If
these results reﬂect the views
of the general student body as
well, how, then, does it seem
like the Opinions section.is

always inundated with conser-
vative thought? There was no
siege of the editorial offices.
Conservatives care more, pure
and simple. We thus provide
ourselves with the opportuni-
ties to be heard.

Fortunately, such trends can
also be seen on a national
level. Republicans have histor-
ically had a more committed
constituency. In the mid—term
election of 1994, a huge
Republican victory, under 39
percent of the voting age pop-
ulation cast ballots. Many
political commentators sug-
gested that, given these num-
bers, the conservative tidal
wave was not a true measure
of public opinion. However.
the opinions of non—vot_ers
mean little. Only the thoughts
of those who participate are of
any real consequence.

Overall, the national public
tends to be left of center, par-
ticularly on social issues. For
instance, opinion surveys indi-
cate that most people favor the
idea of some form of national
health care, abortion rights.
some forms of affirmative
action, gun control and
defense cuts. a

Why, then, does it seem that

these views are becoming’

unpopular in Congress? Why
don’t liberals get the election
turn-out that they desperately
need? There are a number of
different explanations. One
possibility is that conserva-
tives tend to be more educated.
According to the Voter News
Service, in the 1994 election,
college graduates voted 55
percent Republican. Voters
with some college education
also favored the GOP, voting
59 percent Republican.
However, only 39 percent of
those not completing high

school voted for the GOP.
These numbers indicate that
conservative voters likely earn
more (no surprise), but they
are also probably more aware
of political issues. For exam-
ple, 64 percent of frequent lis-
teners to political talk shows
favored the Republicans in
1994. Obviously, those who
know more about politics are
more likely to participate.

’ Other possible explanations

for Democratic apathy are the
following: inability of the
working «poor to find the time
to vote, complacency that
comes from controlling
Congress for 40 years and the
difficulty of students and the
elderly, who are generally lib-
eral, to cast ballots.

Is it possible for this trend to
change? Well-known and
inﬂuential liberals certainly do
their part. Did you notice who
was encouraging people to
vote in the last couple of elec-
tions? People such as
Madonna and Arsenio Hall
were popular figures asking
for a big turn—out. MTV cer-
tainly has done its part. with
“Rock the Vote" ads targeting
its young audience. What was
the bottom line‘? The mostly
liberal audiences received 21 lot
of attention. but I never saw
any business executives trying
to twist any arms to encourage
voting. Thus. the people who
care less about politics and
need some sort of prodding are
generally Democratic voters.

So regardless of the particu-
lar reasons for this trend. the
results seem obvious. Until it
is reversed. I will continue to
pray for nation-wide blizzards
each election day.

Volleyball clroiwo of Loyola

By Matt Grove
Staff Writer ‘

Once again the Pitt Lady
Panther volleyball team packed
their bags for a tough touma—
ment. Last weekend it was off
to Loyola Marymount
University, but the outcome
was notmuch different than
the last —— at least to the pub-
1ic’s eyes.

Coach Cindy Alvear and her
team traveled to less-than-
sunny California to meet the
likes of Sacramento State,
Baylor and host Loyola
Marymount. Jet lag or no jet
lag, the Lady Panthers dropped
two out of three matches for
the second week in a row, but
Alvear~noticed improvement
on a larger scale.

“To be honest, we just
played the best volleyball this
weekend that we have played
all season long,” Alvear said.
“This also has been by far our
toughest tournament in terms
of competition.”

The Lady Panthers met
Sacramento State in the first
match of the tournament on
Friday night. Sacramento State
entered the contest with a per-
fect 6-0 record and hopes of
notching its. seventh win. That
seventh win didn’t come as
easily as it had hoped.

Pitt lost the first game 15-9 ‘

Soccer defeats Providence and

Connecticut on the road

By Connie Nigro
For The Pitt News

.What did Friday and
Sunday’s Big East Pitt soc-
cer games have in com-
mon?

Goals by Jeff Porter,
excellent team effort by the
players and victory.

Sunday afternoon the Pitt
soccer team stepped onto
the field to face off against
Connecticut. The tempera-

ture barely hung onto 60
degrees, and rain fell
steadily.

As the game progressed,

it was UConn that drew
first blood. UConn forward
Dan Sapienza shot a penal-
ty kick to the lower. right of
the net at 20:36 to give the
Huskies a 1-0 lead.
' Eight minutes and 40 sec-
onds later, it was Pitt
senior. Jeff Porter who
answered UCon‘r_1’s goal
with a goal of his own,
tying the score at 1-1.

The game continued as
each team battled for the
go-ahead goal. -Thirty-three
minutes later, during a mad
scramble in front of the
net, Pitt’s Drew Kopp

goaL

Pitt defeated Connecticut
2-1, bringing the Panthers’
record to 4-2 overall and 2-
0 in Big East play.

Coach Joe Luxbacher was
pleased with weekend play
and the results. “UConn is
a strong’ team,” he said.
“To win up there is very
difficult, but a lot of differ-
ent people came up big. It
was a good team effort.”

Team effort, according to
Luxbacher,_is the key to
being successful the
remainder of the year.

“It’s not going to be just
one person coming up big
for us. We need a bunch of
leaders on _the field who do
their job,” Luxbacher said.

The team proved they can
deliver a good “team
effort.” Against UConn,
Pitt registered 11 total
shots on goal. The shots, as
well as the ‘goals, came
from a variety of players.‘

Six different Pitt players
posted shots against Husky
goalkeeper Robb Myers,
while Pitt goalie Adam
Spitzer didn’t have to make
one save.

“He controlled the goal
area, which is what he
needed to do,” Luxbacher
said of Spitzer.

Pitt’s Todd Graf and
Porter proved to be offen-
sive-threats, both having
three shots on goal. Pitt’s
Phil Matilla added two of
his own shots as well.

Not only did Pitt end i_ts
two-game road trip with a
win, but the Panthers began
with one as well.

Last Friday, it was
Providence that fell victim
to the Panthers, 3-0. The
win was Pitt’s first in Big
East play. _

Porter started the scoring
with a goal at 17:06.
Fifteen minutes later, Mike
Dyer cashed in on a-penal-
ty kick, giving Pitt a 2-0
lead going into the second
half. With 10 minutes left
in the game, senior Keith
Hoetzlein scored to put the
game out of reach.

Friday’s victory gave the
team some well-deserved
confidence.

“Winning does‘ a world of
good," said Luxbacher.
who knows confidence is a
big part of the game.

Once again, a lot of dif-
ferent players came up with
big plays.

Pressure.

Pitt Panther football felt it
last Saturday, losing to its first
ranked opponent in its first
nationally televised game this
season. But John Ryan,
despite his five interceptions,
didn’t feel it, because his
offensive line stood its
ground against the Texas
defense and made a good
showing under the national
spotlight. _

In the 38-27 defeat, the Pitt
line allowed only one sack
and kept the Longhorns away
from Ryan throughout the
game. This includes All-

sive lineman Tony Brackens.
who was held to one tackle
before his injury early in the
second quarter. The tackle
came on a broken play during
Pitt’s second scoring drive.

change. .

“One call, one service point or one less
error and we’re 6-4 and everyone thinks
we’re having a great season,” said
Alvear. “We improved statistically, and
that shows that we’re improving. It will
come.

Pitt went on to face Baylor in the next -

game and came away with a quick win.
Baylor came into the match 1-9 and
shocked Pitt with a 15-11 win in the ﬁrst
game. The Lady Panthers then reeled off
three straight games, 15-6, 16-4 and 15-

10, for the convincing win.

Mitchell led Pitt with 18 kills and a
.485 hitting percentage. Sarah Mikla
chipped in with 14 kills and a .345 per-
centage of her own.

Alvear was extremely happy with the
play of these two seniors.

“Sarah Mikla seemed to come out of
her shell this weekend. On the tourna-
ment she hit .283 and had 36 kills,”
Alvear said. “Coming into the weekend,
she was hitting .139 and averaged only
2.5 kills per game.

“Mitchell also was great, making the

All-Tournament team. I’m pleased that
these girls have really taken their leader-
ship roles now.”

Before the season started, the team
took a trip to Ligonier to work on details
and “getting through the web.”

“During that time we had an exercise
where we had to get through a web as a
team without touching the sides,” said
Alvear. “It took us about an hour and a
half to fmish, but we finally took in all
the details and did it. That is the way our
season looks right now, too.”

In the ﬁnal game for the Panthers, host

Loyola Marymount ruined the Panthers’
bid to go 2-1 on the trip. Pitt lost in three
games 15-13, 15-4 and 15-9. Again,
Sarah Mikla was the bright spot for Pitt,
with 13 kills and a .435 hitting percent-
age. Sarah Noriega of LMU led the game
with 15 kills and a .560 hitting percent-
age in the match. '

ered 83 yards on 21 plays, and
kept the offense on the field for
nearly 11 minutes, not including
commercials. That’s tough
enough, but playing in the
trenches in 110 degree heat

makes the offensive line statis-

tics for the drive more amazing
— no sacks, no hurries and,
most importantly, no holding or

, off-sides penalties.

That -line discipline actually

kept the drive going late in the
quarter, when a Ryan hard-
count on fourth and two drew
the Longhorns off sides and
eventually led to the field goal
that put Pitt ahead 10-7.

While the lead came and
went in the third quarter, the
line kept up its level of play.
After an onside kick was recov-
ered and a reverse netted six
yards, running back Chris
Patton broke a sweep around

right end for 42 yards to set the
Panthers up on the Longhorn
five. Patton, not a breakaway

1 back by any stretch of the imag-

ination, got great blocking from
the right side, especially right
guard Jeff Craig, who played
well before an injury shortly
after the play.

And while the line is not sup-
posed to be deep this year,
backup Jason Sepkowski held
his own as the Panthers moved

forward, capping the drive with
a 1-yard run by Chris Schneider
that came off a strong line
surge. After that drive, howev-
er, everything began to fall
apart for the Pitt team as a
whole.

On the next possession, Ryan
was intercepted in the end zone
from the 7-yard line. He was
under no visible defensive pres-
sure. He had another pass

period but couldn’t blame the
Longhorn rush, despite the
injury to another starter, Tony
Orlandini, late in the third.

Pitt was finally stopped for
good late in the fourth, when a
Ryan pass was tipped into the
hands of Longhorn linebacker
Jason Reeves. He returned it for
the final touchdown of the con-
test just before Bevo the
Longhorn mascot could be
completely broiled and served

. with a side of fries as a

postgame meal.

The postscript is that Bevo
garnered more attention from
the national television commen-
tators than the line play of the
Panthers. If the triple-digit heat
forced Anthony Dorsett out
with leg cramps, think how the
offensive line was feeling, espe-
cially after playing 21 minutes
in the first half alone.

Thad Culpepper. who
replaced Dorsett after his injury.
said, “We had trained and con-
ditioned this week because we
knew it was going to be hot.”
He also remarked that the heat
"pla_-, e-"’a factor, but not a major
factor."

Where the Panther line is
concerned, Culpepper is right
on with his assessment.
