Dedication ceremony held in WPLI
for International Jazz Hall of Fame *

By Toby Trosky
The Pitt News

“It don ‘I mean a thing if you ain ‘I

—Duke Ellington

“We need to raise a question basic
to why we are here,” Dr. George
Butler, vice president of Columbia
Records, said. “Why is the univer-
sity dedicating itself to a Jazz Hall of
Fame rather than assuming any
other program?

“Maybe for the performance,
maybe for the music itself, or maybe
we are here to preserve and nurture
jazz music,” Butler, the keynote ‘
speaker at the dedication ceremony
for the International Academy Jazz
Hall of Fame, said to the crowd
gathered on the main floor of the

A PA T bus passes McKee Place

horn, to force the crowd of people
backjon the sidewalk and out of the
street. A woman walking in the bus-
lane sees him coming; she hops back
up on the sidewalk. Passengers get
off and new ones board. The bus is
crowded as it heads towards the
Bigelow stop in front of the Towers

we want to do what we can to assure
that the youth can study the tre-
mendous legacies and to keep jazz
alive.”

Nathan Davis, a prominent pro-
fessor of music at Pitt, was instru-
mental in establishing the
International Academy of Jazz Hall
of Fame. Davis said the idea was
born in 1977 as a result of conversa-
tions between himself and the presi-
dent of the Jazz Academy. “Jazz is
America’s most important cultural
contribution to the world,” Davis
said. “In addition to awarding
plaques, we wanted to try to do
something else to honor the contri-
butions these people have made to
jazz,” Davis said. “In my lifetime, I
have done a lot ofthings to be proud
of. This is one of the things that I am
most proud of.”

It is appropriate for the Hall of
Fame to be located in Pittsburgh, as
Pittsburgh has traditionally been a

“hotbed” for jazz. Three of this‘

year’s inductees, Kenny Clark, Errol

falls into a woman’s lap‘ hollering,
“Who taught him how to drive?”

This fall, there have been five acci-
dents involving pedestrians and
PAT buses. Many people say that
Fifth Avenue is like an interstate
because buses comeup one way and
traffic goes down the other. “The
worst time to ride through Pitt ‘is
when the college students get out of
class,” said Jim Lane, who drives the
61C from downtown to Oakland
during rush hour.

On Nov. 18, the Port Authority

Transit will shift the 61A (East
Pittsburgh-Wilkinsburg) and the
61B (Braddock-Swissvale) routes
from Fifth Avenue to Forbes
Avenue. This willibe a three-month
experiment to see if there will be
fewer accidents reported.

“I feel that the buslane is safe. The
only problem is that people don't
cooperate with the buses,” said
Sarah, another bus driver. “I’ve seen
college students put their foot out in

There is an international selection

jazz greats like Louis Armstrong,
Duke Ellington, Thelonious Monk
and Billie Holiday. The plaques in
their honor were unveiled while
recordings of each artist's music
played in the background.

“It seems to me,” said Butler,
“that Pitt considers jazz as serious
music, just as they do classical
music. The Hall of Fame lives in the
future as well as the past.”

The dedication to the Interna-

Placement service offers
seniors help with job market

By Greg Evanina

The Pitt News

Although it is only early
November, one thought on the
minds of many seniors is getting a
job. In order to become employed,
the graduate can take the traditional
approach of targeting prospective
employers and later interviewing
with them. This, however, can
involve -a great deal of time and
effort. But by taking advantage of
one of Pitt’s facilities, the University
Placement Service, seniors can find
some much-needed assistance with
their job searching.

The University Placement Service
has been in existence since the late-
l940s. According to Bob Hopkins,
the director, its soleresponsibility is

N ewsbriefs-—

PITTSBURGH (UPI) -— An
International Jazz Hall of Fame was
officially dedicated at the University
of Pittsburgh Wednesday. Among

' the jazz greats honored at the cer-

emony were Louis Armstrong, Billie
Holiday and composer Duke Elling-
ton. The three were ‘honored with
bronze plaques at the university’s
International Academy Jazz Hall of
Fame.

(UPI) — In foreign policy, Rea-
gan will continue his hard-line
approach on Central America and

its dealings with The Soviet Union. '
. In four years he has not achieved one

arms agreement with the Russians

' and has had only one meeting with a

ranking Soviet official — Foreign
Minister'Andrei Gromyko.
But it appears‘ that, like other

presidents,‘ Reagan would like to -

leave a legacy of some new under-

standing between the superpowers_..

He hopes to visit Moscow during his
second term ‘ and hold a summit

to help graduating seniors get ajob.
It first provides orientation to job

seekers and later tries to market

them by arranging for interviews.
The first step a graduating senior
must take to get on the placement
service’s file is to register with them.
The student must complete informa-
tion -forms and then return them
with a $5 fee. "Also, 25 copies of the
student's resume must be included.
Once he is registered, the student
is able ' to take advantage of a
number of resources. The placement
service offers workshops on such
topics as writing resumes and inter-
viewing. There is also a job counsel-
ing service and a career library.
Ultimately, the service will set up

- interviews for the student with com-

panies from all across the United
States.

Hopkins advises that graduating
seniors register immediately, saving,

_with over 500 companies.

“The sooner they get into the system,
the better off they are.” However, he
cautions students that the placement
service IS not responsible for getting
them _]0bS. “Our services are of no

value by themselves. They are onlyr
of value when the student follows‘
up." He said that companies only.‘

want -to hire the best people, but‘

other candidates can get jobs if they.

make a conscientious decision to be-

ready and willing to look for work.‘

_ Although Hopkins and his staff
saw company recruiting curtailed by

35 percent in the past few years, he is]
optimisticthat things are improving. I
Already this year, Hopkins has seen I
a l0 percent increase in recruiting]
over I983. r "

The placement service, which.
Hopkins considers to be one of the
largest in » Pittsburgh, expects to
schedule-9,000 interviews this year

meeting somewhere with his Soviet
counterpart.

In Central America, Reagan
clearly hopes to promote victory
over the insurgence in. El Salvador
and he would like to see the Sandi-
nista government in Nicaragua
overthrown.

In the Middle East, where his poli-

R cies have frequently backfired, Rea-
_ gan may seek a diminished role for

the United States, other than an
even closer military and economic
relationship with Israel.

Reagan would like for his current
cabinet‘ to remain in place, but some
departures may be expected. Labor
Secretary Donovan, who is under
indictment on fraud charges, will
likely be the first to leave. Certainly
Reagan will advance the stalemated

nomination of White House Coun- '

selor Ed_ Meese to be attorney
general.

Reagan is still eager topursue the
issues of a school prayer amend-
ment, anti-abortion laws, tuition tax
credits and a balanced budget

amendment. And undoubtedly, he’
will have _an opportunity to pick

In the long run, in fact, Reagan’s

‘columns are those of the

\’.»ws staff.

It is the sincerest hope of The Pitt News editorial staff
that our re-elected administration will fulfill its campaign
promises and lead America toward a productive and

. peaceful future. We must try, as difficult as it often seems,
to build and maintain faith in the integrity of the Ameri-
can public to determine a positive course of events.

We will all eventually accept the fact that the Reagan
admini"stration’s budget director, David Stockman, is
presently planning a subtle method of increasing our
taxes even though the administration consistently vowed
it would do no such thing. iWe were all aware, even
though we may not admit it, that a tax increase in some

‘form is inevitable in the'face of our current deficit.

Whether the increase is in sales taxes, local and state
taxes, or federal taxes, we will look the other way andpay
the price. In the wake of betrayal, we will remain, unfor-
tunately, actively undemocratic. _

In the midst of a new cold war with the Soviets and an
increasingly threatening posture toward Nicaragua,
Americans will remain tough because a Republican presi-
dent said so. There is no evidence to prove that we are any
more stable and secure now than we were four years ago,
and yet, because we've been sold to the power of positive

.thinking, we believe once again that America is invinci- '

ble. This is undoubtedly a political and psychological
achievement. It is a bit vaporous perhaps, and tempor-
ary, but nonetheless an achievement.

Americans have much to be proud of. Ourancestors
proved to be the most industrious people of the 20th
century: There seemed to be nothing that American inge-
nuity could not achieve. The fruits of their labor put men

on the moon, defoliated the Vietnam countryside, pro- _

duced transcontinental railroads and telegraph systems
and released a shadow of mass death over the cities of
Hiroshima and Nagasaki. . V

The American people, after glorifying the truths of
their own revolution, have placed their ‘faith. in leaders

who repress the revolutionary ambitions of other peoples .

- who fight for freedom from oppression. Many reputable

scholars and State Department officials believe that it is -

only a matter of weeks or months until the Reagan
administration, with the aid of supportive media, mobil-
izes the American public to support ourmilitary forces to
illegally intervene in the affairs of Nicaragua, a recog-
nized nation with_'a legitimately elected government.
Our mentality metaphorically represents the geo-
graphy of our continent. Surrounded by massive bodies
of water, we seclude ourselves, physically and perceptu-
_ ally, between thick mountain ranges and rocky shores of
American mass society. What looms beyond the horizon

is either evil or not worth recognizing.

  Letters to the Editor

The Real
Pitts burgh

Adam Eisenstat makes a valid
point in “Pittsburgh ~— Valley of
Lost Nerves” (Nov. 7, I984). All too
often, the city’s official boosters
ignore the real Pittsburgh, where the
majority of residents live, work and
shop. Instead, they focus their atten-
tion on the trendy overlay of down-
town, called “Renaissance II” and
say, “This is Pittsburghe the city
with a smile on its face.” The
fashionable shops in One Oxford
Center and the exceptionally sterile
One Mellon Bank Center could eas-

ily be interchanged with their coun- .

terparts in any other American city.
Of course, I realize that commerce,
fundamental to the existence of a
city, cannot be promoted with such
slogans as “Pittsburgh — the city
with massive unemployment” or by
brochures illustrated with pictures
of boarded-up storefronts on the
Hill (District). But by attending only
to glitter and glamour, much of what
Eisenstat calls the “primal and hon-
est charm that is Pittsburgh” may be
lost. _

It is ironic that on the page
preceding the feature to which I refer

 there is an article entitled “Pitts-

burgh Called Unique.” Ironic,
because Kent Bloomer of thebYale
School of Architecture is quoted as
saying, “The old ethnic Pittsburgh
neighborhoods are slowly dying out,
and new architectural trends like the
North Shore Center can be focused
on the Downtown.“ In that one sen-
tence, Bloomer distills the essence of
what the movers and shakers in local
government and private business see
as the purpose of Renaissance II:
drape the Downtown with ﬁnery .
and curtain off the rest of the city.-
This vision of the city needs to be
corrected so that the ._said movers
and shakers see that there is a large
world , of Pittsburgh out (there
beyond the small world of down-
town and the little strip of riverfront
on the North Side. “Old-ethnic
Pittsburgh neighborhoods  dying
out?“ That would be news to.the very
much alive and largely Italian
Bloomfield and the thriving and sig-
nificantly Jewish Squirrel Hill. Sure,
Hazelwood, Homewood and the
South,Side have fallen on hard times
of late. But there are grass-roots‘
commitments of self-help. The

It is important for Pittsburgh to

actions ofresidents cited above so
that it remains —-. no, not “Some—

My closing remark is anticlimac-
tic, but it does have a bearing on the
city’s sense of community. One

important element of a community ~

is its sense of tradition, its‘1ink with

the past that provides a sense of the "

continuation of life. _Many of the
local elements are lost from year to

year or obscured. In this regard, a

local site, which often is a victim.of
mistaken identity, was again mis-

named in Eisenstat’s piece. The

“Hollow" to which he refers .is not
“Panther Hollow," which is in
Schenley Park, but “Junction Hol-
low.” It may have had a more
bucolic name when it was sur-
rounded by farmlandand a stream
that coursed through it instead of a
railroad. However, it took its- name
from the Pennsylvania Junction
Railroad that was built through it
before the turn of the century. . _

Foiled Again

For the past two months, the stu-
dents of the University of Pittsburgh
have been subjected to the liberal_
rhetoric of a college newspaper that
is so far left, I think it has left the
political spectrum. At last, the egg
that The Pitt News has been laying
since September has exploded in the
faces of its editorial staff. I refer to‘
the relentless and unprecedented
hatred for the Republican Party,
and most specifically, our president,
displayed on these pages.

Last year I had the privilege of
writing for what I believed to be a
respectable forum for journalism,
The Pitt News. I was only able to

write a few articles before I withdrew .
from my classes and began working
full time. Coming back to school this ' -
. September, I was looking forward to -.
-'—.W'!.iI;‘Ifns--'..as?l\n.’ ut:;.w,a <wi.c.I<:ly~.<1is-it

couraged by the strong left-wing

overtones of this paper. Throughout
the past two months, each new issue
of The Pitt News has reinforced my
feelings, but nothing I saw could
have prepared me forwha-t I have
witnessed during the past three
weeks. I

First,'we were treated to “Trash
Ronald Reagan Week.” May I ask
when we celebrated “Trash Fritz
Mondale Week”? Did I miss some-
thing, orvam I being absurd to sug-
gest that anyone mightcriticize this
godlike being? . ’

This was followed by numerous
editorials and letters emphasizing
theoptimistic mood of the Demo-
crats and the failures of our Republi-

‘can administration, seasoned with a

generous helping of photos depict-
ing enthusiastic supporters of the
Mondale/ Ferraro campaign.
occasional news brief reminded Pitt
students that Reagan was also run-
ning for president and held a com-
manding lead in the polls.

, However, The Pitt News went
above and beyond the call of duty
with the repulsive Nov. 5 issue.
Three articles and one editorial

- depicting the evils ‘of a Republican

administration were apparently not
enough to mold'student opinion, so
some coy journalist left a friendly
reminder of his political views below,
the Mondale endorsement. This is a
blatant and inexcusable example of
irresponsible journalism. Express-
ing one’s views in- such a backward
and unprofessional manner is insult-
ing, tasteless and disgusting. The
only explanation might be that
because the Mondale endorsement
was so poorly written and lacking

e’ in content the editors felt they
needed a different tactic in order to

make their point. In my opinion,

as

An.

9.

The Pitt News has sunk to ‘a new .

low. Perhaps the editors should take
the advice of their editorial cartoo-
nist — “If you don’t have anything‘
intelligent to say, don’t say anything
at all.“ Of course, this suggestion
would effectively wipe out '-most of

" the contents of any given issue of this

paper, so I imagine it will be ignored.

I must say, however, that I would
be remiss if I failed to thank this
paper for its strong support of Mon-
dale and Ferraro. As’ a proud
Republican, I can only hope that
such generous patronage is afforded
future Democratic candidates, thus

I assuring more Republican victories.-

As soon as you've wiped the egg"off
your faces, editors, why don't you
tell us what, else is wrong with
America?’ . «

Dr. Donald Goldstein of the.

GSPIA faculty seemed cynical
about the problem. “GSPIA is the
Rodney Dangerﬁeld of the univer-
sity,” he said. “We get no resoect."

The Provost’s office announced
radical reorganization of GS PIA on
the basis of the ‘faculty’s lack of
scholarly productivity in tlw-. form of
research and publications. Haley
stated, “I disagree with the provost
on the measure of scholarly produc-
tion.” He said there were many other
criteria in assessing faculty that were
“equally worthy and terribly
relevant.” .-

One student, referring to one of
GSPlA’s major concerns of assisting
and educating underdeveloped
nations, felt that the faculty in the

school has radically different-

demands in its research when com-
pared to many other programs.
“When you go to a Third World
country, they don't want to read
articles,” he said.

The impact that the decision will
have on the students of GSPIA is
not certain. Most students, though,
seemed upset with the effect that yes-
terday’s decision may have on the

reputability of a degree‘ which, until
yesterday, was regarded as one of
the nation‘s_best in their ﬁeld. Stu-
dents commented that the unfavora-
ble evalutions of GSPIA made by
the provost’s task force and the non-
existence of GSPIA when they
pursue a career will have a substan-
tial effect on a future that they felt,
until now, was fairly secure.

A second round of applause fol-

A lowed a question aimed at Haley by

an American student. “What do you
think is the impact on the credibility
of our degree?" she shouted. Dean
Haley stated that, even after the con-
troversy, “We will continue to admit
students.” Such students would«fin-

Students responded to Haley’s
comment with jeers. “Who’s going
to want to come?" retorted another
student. “I turned down other uni-
versities to come here," she con-
tinued, “I didn't come for the
University of Pittsburgh: I came for
GSPIA. This bad P.R. is going to
affect me and my degree when I get
out of here."

Students also expect a “mass exo-
dus" of faculty upon loss of tenure to
affect completion of their degrees at
GSPIA. “If one of the faculty died,
we would have to replace him,"
responded Haley, “and that's what
we would have to do if he were
terminated."

A demand from the crowd for stu-
dent representation to the provost
became hostile when Haley
responded to an initial demand with
the comment, “Maybe I’ll work
something out.” Eric Wittenberg, a
graduate student of law and public
and international affairs, com-
mented that sihce the money ‘at stake
was the student’s, they should have
some say in the university’s deci-

‘ sions. Several students commented

after the announcement that they
felt a lawsuit was in order.

Though the provost’s office stated
that plans for assessment and refor-

mation of GSPIA had started last»

March and that all should have been
aware of the possibility of a major
change, most students said they w_ere
surprised. “I got wind of it last year,"

The meeting yesterday closed at 1
p.m., leaving stunned students and
faculty to discuss their futures. One
foreign student, identifying himself

only as an East ‘African, said that he
did not feel it was a mistake coming
to the University of Pittsburgh, des-
pite his uncertain future. ‘‘It’s just a
great loss,” he said. “Someday,

Tutoring offered

[By Donald Porter
The Pitt News

On a Thursday evening, John-'

Mull spends his time not looking at
television or playing basketball with
friends but helping a third grader
with her math over the phone.
John Mull is a volunteer tutor fpr
the Extraordinary Tutoring Project
at Western Psychiatric Institute and
Clinic. He and other volunteers aid
Pittsburgh area students in math,

‘spelling and reading over the phone

Monday through Friday from 3
p.m. to 6 p.m. for free.“I got inter-
ested in the program when I saw
their ad in the Pitt News and I
always like working with kids," Mull
said. Students from the first to the
fifth grades call to get’ help in their .
subjects; there have been high school
students that call in also. This is the
second '_/e -_r of the program's
exis"t'ence._ - - _

 Ruffin, coordinator of ET,
says the program was started by Dr.
Mary Margaret Kerr and Dr. /
Robert A. Gable to help’ primary
level students with mild learning dis-
abilities and others who need reme’-_
dial help in arithmetic, spelling and
reading. .

“The program recruits volunteers
and ‘teaches them the necessary skills-
to tutor students," said Ruffin; “It’s
always a lift to see. people helping
with the tutoring.”

“We did what we did because of

Stram. .

According to board member
David Pikovsky, “Student Govern-
ment constitution should be quoted
 when making a charge, it is not the

word of God. We appointed a quali- .

fied person and regardless of the
decision, I will work with Wendy as
a.board member."

“I’m absolutely bored of political

antics. We‘re here forstudents, not
to play politics,” said board member .

Community College majoring in

college credits for her work.
Deborah Lambert, the Peer Tutor-
ing coordinator, trains the volun-
teers for ET. “My long-term goal for
the program is to see community
centers in Pittsburgh take on the
project,” said Lambert. '

Already the Jewish Community
Center in Squirrel Hill has a pro-
gram that is training fifth graders to
tutor children one-to-one. Also
starting on Nov. 6, the East Liberty
Presbyterian Church, along with the
Mount Ararat Baptist Church, is
offering free one-to-one tutoring
Monday through Friday between 3
p.m. and 6 p.m. for kindergarten
through 12th grade.

This three-year program is being
funded by a $144,000 grant from the
U.S. Department of Education to
Western Psychiatric Institute and
Clinic, part of the University of
Pittsburgh.

“Four Vietnamese high school
students call in regularly to get help

_ in English,” said Cary Ruffin, who

runs the Extraordinary Tutoring
Project.

“It is very gratifying to have the
opportunity to watch, other kinds
help tutor others," said Lambert.

nary Tutoring Project can contact

Pascal also brought charges
against the Student (Government
Elections Committee to the atten-
tion of the Judicial Board, concern-
ing the polling place at the David
Lawrence location. He charged that
it was never approved by the Elec-
tions Committee or the board. He
requested that the Elections,Com—
mittee void the votes that were cast
at David Lawrence.

’ The Judicial Board dismissed the
chargebecause “the polling place
was not changed to deceive any

voters and was advertised along with .

all other polling places.”

The Judicial Board suggested that
the Elections Committee have all
parts of the election code monitored
and checked for all future elections.

by Paul Anderson

About 15 years ago, the new jazz
instructor at Pitt heard that some
friends of his were playing in town at
the Crawford Grill. So, the new
teacher grabbed his sax and headed
down to do some jamming with a
group that he had worked with less
than a year before in Europe. After

the gig, Dr. Nathan Davis and the

world famous drummer, Art Blakey,
got to talking. Davis suggested that
maybe Blakey could come over to Pitt
and talk with the students about jazz.
As Davis reminisces, ”We got started
with the informal talk and thenafter
the next year, I started calling up my
friends, and that's how it started.
Actually, it got started by accident, to
tell you the truth.”

What started so informally has
grown into an annual event of world-
wide status. Every November, , a
group of highly acclaimed jazz artists
descends on Pitt for a few days. Dur-
ing this time, each artistgives a free
workshop on his instrument where
he explains his attitudes about play-
ing and music in general and fields
questions from the starry-eyed par-
ticipants. After the seminars are fin-
ished, the musicians all combine their
talents and after handing out sparse
lead sheets to their tunes, they take
to the stage to perform a few seats of
monumental jazz. -

Looking over the lineups of the

past, one instantly realizes that this '
event reads like a who’s who of the‘

leaders in modern jazz. Nearly every
important artist in jazz has taken part
in the event at least once: Miles
Davis, Grover Washington,Jr., Dizzy
Gillespie, Dexter Gordon, Jim Hall,
Max Roach, Richard Davis, Monty
Alexander. *

The lineup of musicians for the
1984 Pitt Jazz Seminar and Concert is
as ambitious and star—studded as
ever. Headlining the show is Sonny
Rollins, one of the greatest living
tenor saxophonists in jazz. Rollins’
appearance is a very special one

because He has always been reluctant ~ '

to play ”all-star lineups.” He will
appear this year, however, mostly

. out of his friendship with Davis, the

organizer of the event. Also headlin-
ing the concert is Freddie Hubbard,
perhaps the most important trumpet
voice since the early '60s when he
took part in the revolutionary record-
ings of the late great John Coltrane.
Hubbard has continually been one to
stretch the boundaries of jazz. His
work with Herbie Hancock is particu-
larly landmark. Davis, who will be
performing on soprano saxophone,
has recorded jazz extensively and
tours .. often, especially in Europe,

— where he lived and gigged during the ~
. 19605.

The rhythm section of Ron Carter

 ~. « -Sﬂhovvcsaée‘, Friday,’ November 9, ‘1984

 

on bass and Peter Erskine on drums
promises to be driving and dynamic.
Ron Carter is probably the most rec-
ognized bassist in today's jazz, and his
authoritative playing easily supports
his widespread popularity among
musicians and listeners alike. Erskine
is best known for his extensive work
as the drummer for the iconoclastic
and influential Weather Report.
Weather Report was the most popu-
lar jazz-rock fusion groups of the
19705 and is still together under the
perennial leadership of Joe Zawinul
and Wayne Shorter,,keyboardist and
saxophonist respectively.‘

Also appearing this year will be,

veteran jazz piano virtuoso Cedar
Walton. Walton has been a fixture of"
the jazz scene for some time and will
bring his exciting and accomplished
keyboard stylistic approach to this
year's concert.

However, for this writer, the most
exciting aspect of this year's show is
the area debut of Emily Remler, a 27-
year—old female guitar virtuoso. She
has completed four albums and is
_already an established nameamong
jazzophiles. She combines the lyri-
cism of her guitar heroes, the late Bill
Evans and the popular Pat Metheny.

Several aspects of the event make it
very special. Primarily, there is the_
understanding that both the seminar.
and the concert are being presented.

for’ the student to hear and learn. .

Also, there is the exciting element
that each ye'ar, the lineup of artists is
one in which the performers have
never all played together before.
Thus, the surprise element of spon-
taneous chemistry elevates the event

pinto something very unique. As

Davis remarked, ”It is known that we
are in a leadership position and the
kids ought to support it.”
Particularly important aboutthis
year's event is the dedication of the.
International Jazz Hall of Fame. Pitt is
the first university in the world to
establish something of the sort. The
Hall of Fame will be permanently

' located in the main floor of the Wil-
liam Pitt Union. Fourteen plaques '

have already been purchased at the
formidable cost of, around $1,500 a
piece. The dedication ceremonies
took place this Wednesday.

The cost of putting on the seminar/
concert annually is the biggest prob-
lem Davis and the seminarlconcert
committee must surpass. During the
early years of the event, Davis
received four grants from Gulf Oil,

Mellon Bank and other generous con- '
tributions. Later, the event began to .

collect grants from the‘ National
Endowment for_ the Arts, and this
year, contributions to put'on the

event have come from the Pennsylva- -

nia Council for the Arts and the city
of Pittsburgh. The Pitt Student
Activities Fund has always taken’ a

  

Festival brings world's ,

major role in financing the annual
happening. The concert, along with
the artists’ minimal compensations,
usually costs about $25,000 to
finance. The musicians are not paid"
enormous sums of money, under-

standing that the event is for the stu- j’

dents and is not the proper place for a
”star trip.” ' .
When talking with Davis, it seemed
quite obvious that jazz doesn't have ,
such a hard time in Europe, finan-.

' cially speaking. Davis attributes this

to several things but primarily that
jazz is treated as an art form in_
Europe whereas in our country it
must compete for radio play with cor-
porate Top 40 rock and pop. Even the
National Endowment for the Arts
contributes only 20 percent. of its
funds to anything but classical music.
In Europe, the airways are controlled
by the government instead of the
fancy of adolescent _MTV addicts.
Because. of that, jazz gets its fair
share of broadcasting. In Pittsburgh,
for example, jazz can only be heard ‘on
about three different stations at-
some very peculiar times. WDUQ

greatest players to Pitt

plays jazz nightly from 10 p.m. to 1
a.m.

WYEP, a listener-supported ax

radio station in dire financial straits, 

has a great, commitment to playing
good jazz, and WRCT, the CMU stu-

dentsradio station, plays jazz also. 97 _

FM, a soft rock station, plays pop/jazz
nightly from 10 to 2, and 104 FM
gives jazz/rock a few hours every
Sunday morning.

To emphasize his point about jazz’s

success in Europe, Davis told me of a A

show he‘ played this summer in'Bel—
gium. With he and Toots Thieleman

headlining a gig, 10,000 people were ,

in attendance and the concert. was
recorded and made into two albums.

Davis feels that jazz became popu-
lar in the 1970s because it began to be
taught on college campuses like Pitt.
His classes in jazz are always well
attended and he feels that this Satur-
day night’s concert would be a perfect
opportunity for the non-jazz fan to

experience a great jazz session. In our

discussion, Davis’ final remarks
drove to his point very succinctly.
”Tell the kids to support this shit, or it
ain't going ‘to last."’

Looking over the lineups of the past, one instantly realizes that this event
reads like a who’s who of the leaders in modern jazz. Nearly every important

artist in jazz has taken part in the event at least once: Miles Davis, Grover
Washington, ]r., Dizzy Gillespie, Dexter Gordon, Jim Hall, Max Roach,
Richard Davis, Monty Alexander.

A Plea In Her Ear

Bombarding the senses

by Jeffrey Sewald

If one was able to harness all the
energy that darts about the stage in a
Feydeau farce, the world would have
discovered its long sought. alternate

, source of » power. Pitt's Mainstage
production of A Plea In Her Ear exudes
enough energy. to lighta ten-room

' house.‘ ~

Directed with precision by Kath-
leen George, this raunchy romp set in
the early 1900s chronicles a prepos-
terous series of events spawned by

«suspicion and marital infidelity and
never strays from the essence of its
genre — farce. is. designed to promote
the belly laugh.

Hugh Rose has undertaken the for-
midable task of the dual role that is
the guts of this play, that of Victor
Emmanuel Chandebise and Poche,
whose frequent mistaken identity
supplies much of the impetus for the
confusion and cartoonish violence.
Throughout his many character re-

versals and lightning entrances and‘

exits, Rose makes the distinctions
between the uppity andproper Victor
Emmanuel and the slovenly soused
Poche crystal clear. The vocal charac-

terizations and body movements of_
I each are sharp and defined, from the
6 uptight retentive to the swaying

lush. -

The entire production is a physical
assault of the senses, much ..as it
should be, complete with screams,
gun shots and revolving beds. The

creation of" this sensual bombard-.

ment relies.heavily upon superior
timing and execution. _

In the case of Camille Chandebise,
played-~_by James Bond, whose cleft
palate I" makes his speech nearly
impossible to understand, the "con-

.centration required for sustaining

the impediment without a slip—up is

considerable. Bond eventually per-
forms a ‘dual role of his own. When
Dr. Finache, played by ‘Richard
Ewing, produces a false metallic pal-
ate for Camille, Bond's task asan
actor_ becomes more difficult as he
must shuttle between Camille the

babbler and Camille the articulator. ~

His performance was a direct hit.
Dr. Finache (‘to Camille): Now your
trouble is — the roof of your mouth
‘hasn't formed properly. The sounds
don't bounce off it. They float up and

they get lost somewhere behind your ‘

face. -

This playful use of language and
cruel humor helps to give the play its
sense of the ridiculous. The rampant
exaggeration and characters’ self-
absorption and seeming disinterest in
the problems of the others bring to

_ _.the_ stage feelings we all, as human
’ beings, experience from time to time A
— selfishness,'wanton violence, lust '

and vulgarity — all tightly woven
with a string of happenings-that only
the genius of Feydeau could draw
together in two hours’ worth of

‘ theatre.

Essential to the play are the female
counterparts, most notably Maura
Minteer, who brings to life the suspi-
cious and overly dramatic Raymonde-
Chandebise, the sexually frustrated

_wife of the prim Victor Emmanuel.

Suspecting her husband's unfaithful-

-ness» at the outset of the play, Ray-

monde, along with her -friend
Lucienne Homenides de Histangua

"(played-_, by Tammy Bouzos), con-.__

ceives a plan to entrap Victor Emma-
nuel by luring him into. a contrived
sexual rendezvous at a well—known
bordello. When the action of the play
shifts to the Hotel Coq d’Or (yes, you
pronounced it correctly), the infideli-

’ ties of the entire cast are exposed,_

muchpto the chagrin of the characters
(but to the delight of the audience).

 

Ex

Throughout the lunacy, Minteer’s
performance is solid and appropriate-
ly urgent and Bouzos pulls off the
clever Lucienne with equal grace.

Enter the raging Spaniard, Carlos
Homvenides de Histangua (try saying
that with a cleft palate), portrayed in
grand style by Christopher Jones.
Holding out a pair of pistols to Victor
Emmanuel whom he has accused of
‘seducing his wife: ”Take one so I can
keeeeeel you!”

Sporting a hilarious Castillian lisp,
Jones’ character is as remarkable as
any in the play, though his accent
sounds a bit too affected. The passion

of the character is there, however,-

and the performance is convincing
enough within the exaggerated
world of the play. _

The character of Romain Tournel,
the man who attracts women faster
than a dropped ice cream cone
attracts flies in July, is roguishly
played by Michael Herd. Suave,

' attractive and perhaps the most cruel

  

Michael Herd arid Maura IMinteer in A Plea In Her Ear.

of all the characters, Tournel, whose
major flaw is his inability to keep his

hormones in check, complicates mat- ' 
ters by allowing his desires to plunge . "

him into the middle of the Chande-
bise family dilemma, the focal point

of the action. Herd effectively con-. V’

veys Tournel’s vanity and inflated
ego. _

Imagine all of this confusion laid
against a magnificently colored, func-
tional set and introduced with fifteen
minutes of pre-show musical follies
— a monstrous undertaking for even
the most seasoned professionals.
Pitt's production succeeds on two
major levels. Both the. fun and flam-

boyance come across vividly, and as

one older woman remarked on the
way out of the theatre, ”That’s what I
like about student productions

they seem to have so much fun up

there.”

A With such wonderful material and
such impressive talent, who
wouldn't?

Sketching career of a 20th century master

by Darren Hvizdash

Mark Rothko is truly one of the
greatest masters of 20th century art.
The Carnegie Museum is featuring a
fine ‘selection of hisfworks in a won-
derful exhibition entitled Mark Rothko:
Works on ‘ Paper. The exhibition con-

tains 62 major works and 24 sketches‘

and studies for mural projects from
the _mid-19205 to his tragic suicide in
' 1970,'with particular emphasis on the
deep and heavy colored paintings of
the last troubled years of his life.
The emphasis placed on this exhibi-
tion is to show that these works on

~ paper standas excellent works of art
. unto themselves and are not merely
studies for canvas paintings. These‘

worksjcomplement his famous can-

vas ‘murals of his mature period from‘

1950 to 1970 but are autonomous.
This is pure fact, because during the
1960s, he did not make preparatory
sketches for his m'urals but still pro-
duced works on paper. Also, the

works on paper during this period are

often composed with the t'_bri_ght
glowfing; colors,‘-eof the 5’50s..instead of
 f ‘ ‘

tance Mark Rothko placed on these

works, ‘he would often mount the

paper on three-dimensional supports
to make them look like canvases.
This great Abstract Expressionist
had always been gripped with an
inner nervousness and insecurity.

’ Angst had always been his alter ego,

which found its expression in his art.
Mark Rothko was born Marcus Roth-
kowitz on Sept. 25, 1903, in Dvinsk,
Russia, as a Jew in that‘c_ity’s Jewish
ghetto. At the age of five, he was
beaten upby the anti-semitic Cos-
sacks during labor unrest. At the
time, Dvinsk was a town thriving
withradical political thought and fre-
quent political violence. Such influ-
ence left their mark on Rothko for
the rest of his life. At the age of 10

(1913), his family emigrated to the"

United States and settled in Portland,
Ore}, where he became active in anar-

chist ‘labor movements. He would

always remain interested in
anarchism. '

Rothko attended Yale but dropped
out after_two years, finding academic

sisted of expressionistic landscapes,
genre scenes, still lifes and bathers,

examples of which can be seen at the ’

exhibition.

During the Depression, he and
other artists worked in the WPA. In
the early 19405, Mark Rothko began
experimenting with mythic abstract
Surrealism using the method of auto-
matism. Works on paper became very
important to him in his Surrealist
phase with his use of watercolor and
black ink. His interest in mythic’

- imagery was not to promote any par-

ticular myth but rather the universal
”Spirit of Myth.’-’ As his style fully

matured in the late '40s to the large-

canvases, paper would notjbe domi-
nant in his art until the last few years
of his life. . '

In the late 1940s, a movement
called Abstract Expressionism or the
New York School came .to dominate
the modern art scene. Mark Rothko
was one of its charter members. He
moved to the large mural canvas with
the dominating rough rectangular

forms- free floating in space with
. ._which his. name is associated. These

each other. '
This large mural style of painting
led to his commission from John and
Dominique de Menil for an ecumeni-
cal chapel in Houston in 1964. The

place was dedicated as the Rothko’

Chapel a year after his death. He was
also commissioned to create murals
for the Seagram Building in New
York designed by Mies van der Rohe

and Philip Johnson, but when he

found out they were going to be
placed in a restaurant, he withdrew
his works. He “was also commissioned
todo five murals for the Holyoke
Center in Harvard. Painted prepara-

tions on paper and photos of the-fl-ll

installed works are allon display.

In 1968, Rothko suffered an aneu- _ 
rysm of the aorta. He was too weak to -. ‘

work the large canvases, so he
resorted to works on paper which are
much more easily handled. The last
few paintings of his life are composed

inheavy blacks, grays and purples.)

They evoke a consuming sense of

depression and gloom. As a friend of‘ ‘ 

‘mine said,‘ ”These look like the‘paint-
ings of one about to commit suicide.”

WAKING UP WITH THE’

HOUSE ON FIRE
Culture Club
Epic

The TV show Fame is success-

A ful for lots of reasons. The big-

gest one is probably that Fame
uses a TV-reality of Brooklyn, a
TV—reality of ethnicity, a TV-
reality of "today’s youth” and a
TV-reality of rock ’n’ roll. Mid-
dle America is comforted by this
docile rendering of threatening
elements. Urban youth, rock ’n’
roll, promiscuity — they're all
here, blanched and denatured
for easy consumption like pro-
cessed peanut butter. Culture
Club's new album operates the
same way.

Boy George has done an
amazing thing in this day of
ReaganlFalwell landslides. He‘

has mass-marketed androgyny 

and sexual ambiguity. He is
witty and visual, two estab-
lished requirements for media
success. But think about it: He
dresses like a girl and Middle
America iseating it up.

This is true to a large measure
because his music is as smooth

and irresistible as cotton candy.

Wrapping a Smokey Robinson-
style voice around pop tunes
with traces of soul, Latin music

and rock has made him as likable
a British conversation piece as
ever washed up on these shores.
Culture Club's new record,
Waking Up with the House on Fire, is
not quite a sunny slice of chif-
fon. As the titlesuggests, it's an
alarm. Though it is soft around
the edges with vague lyrics, this;
album finds the Boy bemoaning

troublesome relations, both -

world-wide ‘and person-to-
person. ”The War Song" blends
a calypso lilt and a women-and-
children chorus with this year's
most direct lyrics: "War is stupid
and people are stupid and love
means nothing in some strange
quarters." Unfortunately, the
vocals, on this song and on all
the others, are delivered with an
off-hand, breezy style. There
isn't much range, emotional or
octave-wise, to set any of these
songs on fire.

Musically, the album
approaches rock from the other

side of a magnifying glass. lt’s .

like a dissection of mainstream‘
rock, using first one, then"
another element with a curious
distance, as though Culture
Club has turned social scientist.
Surprisingly, most times this
works, sounding at turns like
Abba ("Unfortunate Thing”) or
old Smokey Robinson ("Mistake
No. 3"), because the band is

Arista

Gil Scott-Heron's music is
important on two levels: first,
his brand of jazz/African
rhythms is distinctive and
deserves more attention than
it's gotten. Second, he put a very
strong, very militant message in

his music before it was chic for
pop artists to perform at anti-

fundraisers. »

from 10 years of recording, and
Scott-Heron's style is as varied‘
as his choice of subjects. His
occasional scat singing is remi-
niscent of Al Jarreau; the sarcas-
tic and often funny "The
Revolution Will -Not Be Tele-
vised" is in the true style of -
believe it or not — Frank Zappa.
From the mellow "Winter in

America” with Brian Jackson

Scott-Heron appeals to differ-

Hardcore: You love it as a fan,

More likely, you don't pay much
attention to hardcore, which
isn't surprising considering the
obscurity of this extreme and
mutated form of rock.

In the world of thrash," the
bands on Rat Music for Rat People,

Rat Music opens with "The

On Rat Music sideltwo, Fang

belligerently sings, "They sent -

self-help dogmas, Fang is origi-
' nal enough to blame their par-

problems. From hell, the lead
singer relives various adoles-
cent traumas and whines: "Now
‘I'm down there looking up at

Other highlights on side two
are two songs by the ‘Dirty Rot-
ten lmbeciles. Luckily, Rat Music
comes with a lyric sheet,
because this band sings (and
plays) with such amazing speed
that it is almost impossible to
decipher their lyrics without
reading them first. In ”Sad' to

Ending with the grim "Post-

is possibly doomed to a fate of
not being played in mixedtcom-
pany. An odd assortment. of

' alienation, conviction and dis-

chord, Rat Music might only be
truly appreciated by Rat People,

PSVYCI-IEDELIC FURSI KIDS AFTER
DARK

Syria Mosque

November 2, 1984

by Bryan I. Fischer

Seven years, four records, three _
producers and several lineup changes
have brought the Psychedelic_Furs
full circle. From a debut record that
sounded immediately like an assault

' on the pop aesthetic to one of the

most pleasantly listenable lp’s of
1984, the Furs brought out all the
weapons last Friday — none of which
was more armed and dangerous than
lead singer Richard Butler.

Waiting in the wings to ensure a
dramatic entrance, Butler cooly
romped onto the stage to the opening
notes of ”Love My Way.” Greeting

the crowd with handshakesfor those
close enough to the action and sen-

sual stares foreverybody, Butler’

transformed the stage into a personal
playground.

A riveting frontman whose forma-
tive years were obviously influenced
by David Bowie, Butler fed off the
Thin White One from_his plaid over-
sized kimono suit to the theatrical
body language which guided every

song in whatever direction he chose

totake it.
Although. the ' rest of the band
amounted to seven players in all (as

opposed to the three man permanent

lineup) the extra players acted more

often than not as the frame around a

master painting. - A - .
The decision to play every-song-

. you—ever-wanted-to-hear-from-the-
Fursurs kept the crowd‘ on its feet,‘

but the songs from Mirror Moves and
1982's Forever Now seemed the sharp-
est with John Ashton’s cacaphonous
assault theymade on their first two
records. _

Kids After Dark opened the show

headliners were able to‘ muster. 7

In short, this band provides some-

”we're about the wildest band that

not always enough to ensure com-
mercial success. But with their EMI’

The University of Pittsburgh
women’s swimming and diving
team opened its dual meet season
in sparkling fashion yesterday at
Kent.State, coasting to an 80-62
victory. Coach Dave Belowich
was elated over the performances
his defending Big East cham-
pions gave. The team set five
pool records, prompting Belo-
wich,-to remark, “I am very

That is just the way we wanted to
begin the season.”

All-America Sue’ Heon, fresh-
man Marian Cassidy, sopho-
more * Jodi O’Neil and
sophomore. Stacey Moller. _All
four swimmers, along with the
200-meter freestyle team, set

will continue today. The squad is _
in Ann Arbor, Mich. to take on
powerful Michigan. Belowich is
looking for a repeat of last year’s
performance against ‘Michigan,
an 88-62 victory, but cautioned
that this meet will be a much
greater challenge than last sea-
son’s. He explained, “Michigan
is a good team. In last year’s
meet, they had a bad day and we
swam as well as we could. They
have several Canadians back on
their squad this year after a,year’s
absence to ‘train for the Olym-
pics. They are always strong in
diving and perhaps have the best
diving program in the nation.
The return of the Canadians
added to their strong divers will
make them very competitive."
Michigan’s divers led the Wolve-
rines to a No. 10 post-season
ranking last year. .

Belowich will be looking for a
mixture of both young and expe-
rienced swimmers to create a
winning formula in Michigan
today. Following the meet, the
Lady Panthers will return home
and begin preparations for the

Following last week’s upset of the
No. 7 Penn State team (which fell to
No. 9), the Pitt women’s volleyball
team ;travels to Kentucky for the

Louisville Classic. The classic will be .

the spikers" final competition before
the conference championships next
weekend. _

“This is an opportunity to play at
a level that really challenges us,”
head coach‘ Shelton Collier said.
“It’s a perfect preparatory tourna-
ment for the Big East.”

. Pitt, ranked No. 8 in the Mideast
polls, will play Southwest Missouri
on Friday at 9 p.m. and Louisville at
11 a.m. and Cincinnati at 5 p.m. on
Saturday. Southwest Missouri is
No. 7 in the Mideast and Louisville
is No. 5 in the South.

“Cincinnati pinned a_ costly defeat
‘on us last year," Collier said, refer-
ring to the Pitt-Converse Classic
where Pitt lost in four games —— the
fourth in overtime..‘“I’m sure my
team will have no trouble getting up
for them.

“We "have avenged manyof last
year’s losses with convincing wins,

and that’s a good sign." He said the
team avenged itself against Mary- ’

land (3-0),‘ Providence (3-1) and
Penn State (3-0). “We need to add
Cincinnati to that list and, of course,
Providence in the Big East finals.”

Pitt lost to Providence earlier in the I

Following -Saturday’s action, the
team will travel to Eastern Kentucky
for a 1:30 p.m. match on Sunday.
EKU has a skill level near that of
Providence, Collier noted.

“This match was scheduled for.

rehearsal for the Big East ﬁnals. It is

English guides Tulane

, Boyarsky,

By Mark Slndler
The Pit_t‘l‘1ews

Wally English swivels in his seat,
reaches over to his cerebral library
and removes a couple of dated
scrapbooks. In between the covers
— .1980 and ’8l —. there is a focus on
a slice of immortality exhibited by
two ll-1 football teams; their brain-
trust rested with the former Pitt

- offensive coordinator who was there

for only two years in that capacity.

And what seasons they were, with
all the kudos going to English. Per-
sonnel like Wi1lie_Collier, Rooster
Jones, Freddie Jacobs, Rick Tro-
cano, Bryan Thomas and Dan
Marino leading the charge. They
were unstoppable. Many heap the

* credits on English, who shakes them

off, downplaying his tenth tour of
duty on what has been a 12-round
swing with college and pro teams.
Fondly remembered are former
Pitt monsters of defense Jerry
Greg Meisner, Hugh
Green, Bill Neill, Carlton William-
son, Sal Sunseri, Rickey Jackson
and Timmy Lewis. “Both years we
were fortunate. I’m sure we broke
many offensive records," English

said three days ago. “But honest to.

goodness, "the reason we won was
because the defense always got us

. the ball back. The defense wins you

games, 'I‘m convinced of that. And

. maybe the defensive personnel [in

’80-’8 1] were the best everassemble
in college football.” H \ 1
- Ode to the shining past. After a
similar stint with« the Miami Dol-
phins, English landed his first head
coaching ‘position last year with

Tulane, which plays the Panthers
tomorrow (12:20 p.m., Pitt Sta-
dium).' In their second year under
English, the 2-6 Green Wave are
nowhere near playing like Pitt
defense of old. Outscoring Tulane
comes now at a rate exceeding 50
percent of the Wave’s offensive
production. .
One theory points up quarterback
Ken Karcher’s bruised ribs suffered
in last week’s 13-6 loss to Virginia
Tech. The former Shaler standout
who transferred from Notre Dame
has been throwing near 50 percent
for over 1,300 yards, but is question-
able at best for tomorrow. Doubtful

too have been Karcher's performan- —

ces in 27-, 42- and 21-point losses so
far. '

“I don’t think he’s had a poor sea-
son,” English said after Tulane
opened against five straight schools
from the Southeastern Conference.
“I ’ve had a chance to coach 14 quar-
terbacks who’ve made it_ to the pros.
I think this kid is just as smart men-
tally, but it takes playing time and
being in there to execute the offense.
I put Kenny in the same category as
the others, but give him credit. This

‘ is his first year learning the system."

By another name, call it the shot-

‘ gun. Karcher manipulated it to
upset then 4-0 Vanderbilt 27-23 by ..

passing for over 300 yards, earning
not only Sports Illustrated honors
but the Wave’s first win.

“We’re a quarterback-oriented
offense," English said. “College
teams, many are running-oriented.

’We throw the ball a lot and we

depend on the skills and talent of the
quarterback. We emphasize what
they can do.”

Moving on, a second theory nar-
rates English’s dependence on

transfers, having to sign 22 J UCOs
this year.and only eight freshmen.
Only a dozen or so seniors remained
after 30 graduated last year. Add to
this the 25 of 27 freshmen (recruited)
redshirted two years ago. Had Eng-
lish used all 33 scholarships availa-

ble to sign prepsters, easily’ 70'

freshmen (redshirted or otherwise)
would spackle the ’84 roster.

“With the type of schedule we I

have — the toughest in the history of
the school -— that's stupid,” English
remarked. “With all those SEC
teams [six total] and only four home
games, the only route was the

transfer. That’s the only one we had, *

besides getting our brains ‘beat out
with the freshmen.”

Tulane still gets slugged around,

primarily because only two offensive
starters returned,
Jones and tight end Craig Harrison.
After Karcher failed to complete a
pass in an opening 30-3 loss to Mis-
sissippi State, he’s found Harrison
29 times — who leads in yardage
(421) and average yardage (14.5).

_ Jones, meantime, is mediocre at best,

ThePlttNews

Home Box Office is airing a must-
see movie this month. Marlon
Brando heads an all-star cast in the
Oscar-winning “On the Water-
front.” In the most famous scene
from that movie,,Brando utters the
classic line, “I coulda been a
contender.” '

That sounds painfully relevant to
the disappointed fans of the Pitt
football team.

This past August, football fanat-
ics everywhere were swarming the
newsstands for their favorite foot-
ball forecast magazine. They sought
the predictions of the Princes of
Prognostication. My personal
favorite is a magazine entitled
“Game Plan." Its staff, like many
others, foresaw “tidings of great joy"
in the steel city. (Forgive me, but the
department stores are already load-
ing the shelves with Christmas deco-
rations.) I’ll admit that I, too,
envisioned another Top 10 finish for
the Panthers. '

This column usually stresses‘ fig-
ures in examining the trials and trib-

_ ulations of the Panthers. This week,

I am going to lean heavily on just the
facts.

»  ..;s.giIit '9

' rt.

    Writer I clears the

Let's begin with the most obvious
problem, the offense. Many people
expected the Panthersto produce at
least 30 points in every game this
year. Much of this expectation cen-
tered around quarterback John
Congemi. Congemi had an out-
standing year last season. This year,
the passing attack has not lived up to
that standard. But let's consider two
things. First of all, to see Congemi in
person, or Chris Jelic for that mat-
ter, you develop an instant respect
for either one. Neither one is built
along the lines of a Dan Marino.
Each more resembles Doug Flutie.

Flutie may be headed toward the

. —.,. .,-.. .
.-c:t,.l're

Heisman, but he’s got one thing sur- ‘

rounding him that Congemi and
Jelic do not. That is experienced
players. Bill Fralic may be the best
offensive lineman in the country, but
he's only onexrnan. Congemi and
Jelic are two of the most competitive
players in the country and should

never be booed for something that ‘

they don_’t accomplish. They should
be commended for what they do
accomplish.

An obvious lack of experience
exists at tailback. Charles Gladman
and Craig Heyward have been trying
to carry 90 percent of the running
game for a major college football
team. That’s a lot to ask of two fresh-
man who six months ago had _no
pressure on them except in picking

out the right tuxedo for the prom.
Not every freshman is going to shoot
into instant stardom like Herschel

Walker, Marcus Dupree or Tony '

Dorsett. We should be glad that they
show a lot of promise for the future
and do not complain because they’re
not being considered for All-
America honors.

It’s hard to mount a proliﬁc pass-
ing attack when your starting tight
end is injured before the season
starts, you have only one expe-
rienced receiver and no experienced
deep threat. As a result of Clint Wil-
son's foot injury and subsequent
redshirt, the quarterbacks have had
to lean more to the wideouts than
was previously expected. This is a
problem considering that split end

Bill Wallace is the only receiver with .

a good degree of experience.

A major problem in current foot-
ball is that if you lack speed at the
receiving positions, modern day
secondaries (usually loaded with

players who run 4.4 or better in the"
40) will smother any attempt at a '

passing game. Some might ask,
“what about Chuck Scales?" Scales
is one of those players “or better”
speed. But once again, inexperience
rears its uglyhead. You can’t expect
a player to change positions after the
season had started (like Scales did)
and have him become a superstar
overnight.

There’s a big difference between
catching screen passes (like Scales

the running back) and catching"

passes 40 yards downfield at top
speed (like Scales the wide receiver).
It's basically just a matter of timing.
But that timing takes time. ,

The defense has suffered from
inexperience in an unexpected way.
Because of constant nagging injur-
ies, many inexperienced players
have been pressed into duty on the
defensive line. While there haven‘t
been any major injuries, if an inex-
perienced player comes in for only a
few minutes, those few minutes can
result in a big playfor the offense.
The Pitt defense has given up more
than its share of big plays this
season.

Aside from the play of strong
safety Bill Callahan (who I think is
one the ﬁve or six best safeties in the
nation) the secondary cannot seem
to stabilize a solid starting lineup.
With players going in and out all of
the time, no one is able to gain the
proper amount of experience.

The one bright spot for this season
has been the playof linebackers Cae-
sar Aldisert and Troy Benson. The
two men whom Foge Fazio dubbed
“possibly the best set of linebackers
in the country” have lived up to their
billing.

First year is a
success for
Luxbacher

By Kirsten Gostony
The Pitt News

The Panthers’ soccer team has
closed its season with a respectable
9-6-1 record. And with only two
seniors graduat_ing and seven fresh-
men having seen a considerable
amount of playing~«time, the future
looks bright. They have established
a firm base, and although there is
need for improvement, they‘ can
begin to build a strong reputation
for themselves.

Panther defenders Jamie Katzini

and tri-captain Uzoma Chimbundu
will be graduating; however, Chim-
bundu is eligible to compete in colle-
giate games for one more year, and
he is considering attending graduate
school at Pitt. If he does, he plans to
close out his eligibility here next
year.

“Katzin is notonly a fine player,
but he is also a fine person,” stated
head coach Joe Luxbacher. “We’re
going to miss him in terms of leader-
ship both on the field as well as off.
Uzoma had a good year, and he too
is a good leader,” continued Lux-
bacher. “He never said much, but
rather he led by example.”

Returning as seniors will be"

defenders Andy Adelmann and

Brian Casey, midfielders Rick Burk- J
‘ holder and,Vic Hugo and goalie

Dave- Torrence. Among those
returning as juniors will be forwards
Bob Howard and Dave Van New-
kirk. Freshmen who started regu-
larly included Tom Foley, Craig

Freund, Dan Liberati, Dave Moss '

and Scott Reimer. Joe Ross and Jeff
Wilhelm also saw a considerable
amount of playing time.

“As the season continued we were

able to find some effective combina-.

tions on the f1eld,”explained Lux- .

bacher, “but that which is most note-
worthy is that our bench was filled
with capable substitutes; There were
a lot of guys that we called on at
crucial times, and they were able to
come in and do the job.”

Although there will be many play-
ers ‘returning, there is always room
for new.blood. “We have a lot of
strong players that will be returning,

.having had the chance to mature and

improve before next season,” stated
Luxbacher. “Nonetheless, there are
some spots in our game which need
to be filled, and we’ll need to recruit

inorder to help fulﬁll those needs.” — .

They've accomplished some posi-
tive feats this year by ending with a
winning record and defeating highly,
competitive teams, such as Bucknell,

The Pitt News

As November winds chill. the air
all over the northern portion of this
great land of ours, a young sports
fan’s thoughts turn lightly to 
women’s gymnastics? Absolutely.

If this is winter it must be gymnas-
tics season, and both the men's and
women’s teams open the ’84-’85
campaign this weekend. The men

will visit the Naval Academy for a.
meet on Saturday, and the women p

kick off their season with the
Alumni Meet on Sunday (1 p.m.,
Fitzgerald Field House). This meet
is just for fun; the Lady Panther
gymnasts don’t get serious until
Nov. 17 at IUP.

Looking to the '--cson ahead,
head coach Donna Sanft sees ateam
laden with inexperience. “We're

extremely young. We have only.

three returning players and seven
freshmen. One of our veterans, the
team captain, Debbie Dabkowski,
tore a tendon and is out for the sea-
son.” Still, Sanft finds reason for
hope. “We’ll be short-handed in our
matches this semester until we get
settled, but we will still be able to
compete with every team in our
region.”

Of her triumvirate of returnees,
Sanft has very little reason to expect
problems from them. Alisa Spector
qualified for the NCAA champion-
ships last season in the all-around
competition, and is back for her
sophomoreseason. Kristy Pieters, a

junior from Whiting, Ind., will also
compete in every event this year, and

during her freshman season. ‘‘All of

and even after this season we will
have no graduations, while on last
year's team we had five who
' graduated.” ‘
Sanft said the balance beam and
the uneven parallel bars should be
Lady Panthers’ two _main
strongholds. “The beam has been
our weakest event for years but we
should be all right there. The bars
have been traditionally a strong
event for us, and if we can stay away
from injuries we will be OK. We
thought vaulting would be our big-
gest problem, but we will probably
have a good team there."
Most coaches would think seven

 

freshmen on one team would also be
a problem; some would probably

prospect, but not Sanft. “If you

walked into our gym right now, you - '

would never be able to tell we have

look good in practice, but some will _

practice and vice versa. If our veter-

ship, having this many freshmen will V ,

not be a bad thing.

“Youth iswasted on the young,”
the ‘poet once said. That may be true,
but it will be up to Donna Sanft to
see that it's not also wasted on her
gymnastics team. -

Wrestlers begin 84 - 85
season at West Virginia

By Ken DlBucd

 

The Pitt News

Youth and excitement are the two
words that wrestling coach Rande
Stottlemyer used most when de-
scribing the I984-85 Pitt wrestling
team. The Pitt wrestling team opens
up its season this weekend with the
West Virginia Tournament. The
Panthers are looking to improve on
last year’s 5-I2 overall record and
sixth-place ﬁnish in the Eastern
Wrestling League. .

.When asked what the team hopes
to accomplish in the WVU, Tourna-
ment, Stottlemyer said, “We try to
gauge where we are at right now. We
will try to win, but more importantly
it will show us where we need work.”-
He also said that the Waynesburg
match, Nov. 28,, will give him a bet-
ter indication of how the season will
go.

“This year's team hasa nice blend
of youth and experience, with a par-
ticularly strong junior class,” Stot-
tlemyer said. The junior class
includes team-elected co-captains

Joe Bond (158 lbs.) and Kyle Nellis

V (134 lbs.) and other returning star-

ters Gary Bolin (150 lbs.), John
Hnath (126 lbs.) and Jack Uppling
(190 lbs.).

“I'm very pleased with the fresh-

'men this year; they have ins-tilled

enthusiasm and'excitement -in the
team,” he said. Key freshmen who
will be contending for starting spots

-Meadville and Mike T0385] (167

lbs.) from North Hills.

Senior Doug Haines, who has
missed most of the last two seasons
with a knee injury, could help the
Panthers this season if he can regain
his-freshman form — winning an
EWL championship at 150 lbs.
“We're ‘keeping our fingers crossed
for Doug. He has been working real
hard and he can definitely help us if
he stays healthy," Stottlemyer said.

_ “My goal is to repeat as EWL
champion," Haines said. “Because
of my knee 1 can’t do all the moves

that I used to, but ifl work hard I

think-I can win another champion-
ship.” _

The Panthers compete in the pow-
erful
which ﬁnished third in the country
behind the Big Ten and the Big Eight
last year. “Penn State dominates our
league, but we’re hoping if things go
right and we don’t have too many
injuries, we can finish in the top
four,” Stottlemyer said. “We are set-
ting high team goals because if w_e
don't reach them we will still do all
right.”

Stottlemyer, a former All-
America wrestler for Pitt, has been
very pleased with his new coaches.

Jack Spades is a full-time assistant a

coach and a former national runner-
up at 118 lbs. from Slippery Rock,
and part-time graduate assistant Jeff
Jelic was an All-America on last
year’s squad. “All three of us have
different views on certain moves,
which allows the wrestlers to choose

Eastern Wrestling League,‘

share the same philosophies about
wrestling."

Work and sweat are the two
things that the Pitt wrestling team
knows the best. The team practices
twice a day, running in the morning
between 7 and 8:30 a.m. depending
on their schedule. Regular practice

begins at 4 p.m. “Wrestling isn’t a.

glory sport, and these guys won’t be
receiving any professional contracts
for wrestling,” Stottlemyer said.
“They do it for self-satisfaction.
Wrestling prepares our guys for
life,” he said. “If you can get up at 7
a.m. and run, you can certainly get
up and go to work.” .

With excitement and enthusiasm
in every Panther practice, the Pan-
thers could have their most exciting
team in years. J

Bethany and Villanova. But from
‘here they will have to move forward.‘
Besides Villanova, next season's
schedule includes three additional
Big East matches: St. John’s,

“The strongest po1nt_.about our

team this season is that throughout
the year we continually showed
improvement,” Luxbacher said.
“However, we st_ill have a long way
to go. And that’s the way it should
be. You always need to strive for
