Inquiry“Ends.;Semester’s
Work, Plans For 1933-34

Wit.h last Wednesday’s meeting of
the Inquiry Forum, the work of the
organization closed for the semester.
The Inquiry committee, working with
the YM-YWCA under Howard Cohen,
has sponsored religious, social, eco-
nomic, and political discussions at
weekly meetings. '

Plans for next year are as yet in-
deﬁnite, although a political forum
and several economic lectures -have
been scheduled. Cohen emphasized
yesterday, however, that subjects can-
not as yet be chosen, because, “The
Inquiry Forum sponsors discussions
of current interest. It is obvious
that in May we cannot tell what will
attract "httention in September or
October.”

Senior Committee Speeds
Work For Ball Friday

Extend Reserve Ticket
Sale Time Until
This Afternoon

In an effort to reduce‘ the ‘price of
for Friday nigl1t’s formal
Senior Ball’ from $3.50‘to $3, James
Van Nostrand, Dent., chairman, and
his committee have extended to 5
o'clock this afternoon the dead line
for the purchasing of reservation
tickets at one dollar. If a sufﬁcient
number of these ‘advance tickets are
(1lSDOSed of by ‘that time, the ﬁfty-
cent reduction will bef-‘effected, Van
Nostrand stated. ‘Ticketswill be sold
until Friday evening, ' '

Meanwhile ' last minute arrange-
ments for the “Down" in Egypt” af-
fair are rapidly nearing completion.
Dancing to the music of Johnny John-
son and his orchestra will be in or-
der from 10 to 2 o'clock atthe Hotel
Schenley ballroom,

Although the committee is making
every effort to have a dancefthat will
be original in eve1'y’respect over pre-
vious affairs this year, there will ‘be
one convention feature, a" Grand
March. At 11 o’clock Van Nostrand
will escort Miss Dorothy Lewis,’Ed.
’34, at the head of the long parade. -

Miss Lewis, a member o-f Delta
Delta Delta, is one of the outstanding
activities lea.ders of her class. At the
Spring Festival tap assembly she was
tapped by Mortar Board, women’s hon-
orary activities fraternity.‘ She was a
member of the Junior Prom ‘commit-
tee and was re-elected in »April as
secretary of Student Council."

Jolnnny J‘ohn.son"s Hotel‘ Pennsyl-
vania orchestra will desert the air
waves Friday night to play up the
music for the four hours of dancing.‘
The young maestro has ‘an interna-
tional reputation as an NBC attrac-
tion. -1

Close on the tail of a.n»"'announce-

-iment by Van Nostrand that the fair

patrons of the ball will not be favored
-——-with favors—comes another by the
that
evening will be decidedly passe. Al-
though the women may ‘not take too
favorably to this idea,,a_h_a_1:assed and,
ﬁnancially overburdenedﬁhale‘ ‘student’
body will accept this restriction with
feelings akin to love, says the chair-
man. Therefore, athough no one wear-

tance by the doormen, raised eye-
brows, scowls _and scorning miens
will await her-entrance. “It ain’t be-

Student Loan 
Drive Begins

to Cover
Today

WSGA Members,
Entire Campus

“Help a student help hinise'lf!”  ,

This is the motto the Student Loan
committee of WSGA, under the chair-
manship’ of Ruth Drum, C01. 734,’ will
use in conducting its annual tag day
today. The entire __ campus ‘will be
covered in an effortto increase the
funds available to students seeking
loans.

Thyrsa VV. Amos, dean of women,
says of this project: “I am enthusi-
astic about the student loan fund,
When students help students, it.in-
spires the faculty, administration, and
friends alike to contribute.”

Applications of these students to
the limit of $150 a person are consid-

ered by WSGA Student Loan commit-

tee. At present there are four times
as many applications for loans as
there are funds to meet them.

Thus far, loans have been given to
sixteen students, making a total of

-$850 at the rate of 2.per cent interest.
‘ All recipients favoredwith loans have

maintained C averages during the
year.

‘ This is what outstanding students
-have to say about student loan:
Rose Marie Demestichas, 1933 Se-
“nior Queen: “More than any other
one thing on the campus, _student loan
committee needs the backing of the
entire University to do the work it
has to do.
for ﬁne

spect and admiration the

,,work I have seen it do in giving stu-

dents ﬁnancial help.”

Eddie McBride, IC president: “Stu-
dent loan isani excellent opportunity
for students who are unable to secure
ready cash in these depressing times
to aid them in completing their col-

1 lege work.” -

Senior Queen---Alma Mater

l

Rose M. Demestichas

Dorothy Getsiinger‘

“Make way for the Queen and her
court! Here comes the Queen!” This
will be the cry Tuesday, June ‘6, at
the ceremony where Rose Marie Dem-
estichas will be crowned 1933’s Senior
Queen, by Dorothy Getsinger as Alma.
Mater. _

This traditional ceremony, more im-
pressive than any other at the univer-
sity, is taken from the English cere-
mony for the crowning of its kings.
It is the language and tradition of
England perpetuated at Pitt and in-
cludes parts of the ceremony used in
England from the eighth century to
the present day.

Pitt has altered the symbolism given
by the king being led to the throne
and crowned by the Archbishop of
Canterbury by substituting Alma
Mater for the archbishop. It has pre-
served some of the splendid music
and much of the symbolism of the
English ceremony, adapting it to the
university life. In the recognition
scene, the queen is ‘presented to the
audience for acclamation by Alma
Mater, after which she takes her
oath. The investitnre follows, where
she puts on the imperial mantel, which
has been" carried in by a high mem-
ber of the court; the ring of friend-
ship is placed on her ﬁnger; in her
left hand is placed the orb indicating
the sphere of her inﬂuence, and in her
right hand the scepter of power and
authority. On her head is placed the
crown of beauty, and she is given the
Bible to guide her. Preceding the
placing of the crown, the queen from
the previous year, who has been
seated on the royal throne. steps down,
lifts, the crown from her own'head
and hands it to a regalia bearer, and
kneels uncrowned before the new
queen, and then goes to her own regal
chair. ‘

The processional before the cere-
mony begins is compos_ed of all the

women who carry coronets of roy-

heads when the royal crown is given
to the queen. .
Following the crowning of
queen comes the enthronement, and
then the princesses (women of the
class who have done
work) will pay her homage. At the
conclilsipn, the ql-leen’s ‘coronation
robes will be removed and her royal
robes put. on, and the rccesslonal ends
the ceremony.

The coronation ceremony was
written by Miss Thyrsa ‘N. Anlos,
dean of women, with the idea oi‘ mak-
ing this event the outstanding cere-
mony for women of the nn'versity.
The senior queen was decided upon
to supplant the May Queen, because

the old ceremony was felt to lack the

dignity of the closing of the univer-
sity year and because Pitt women
wanted to honor a senior woman. The
present cereinony was written in 1925
and has become one of Pitt’s most
valued traditions as a ceremony
adapted to the academic world and to
the spirit o'f__the commencﬂement sea-

  1 Civil Engineering Head Finds

Records Of W.U.P. in 1882

Pj--—-————-——-

\\-‘liile Professor L. C. :McCa1ldliss,

the University Spoon, which was

head of the department of civil en-{handed down to the juniors this year
gineering, was idly browsing throughlat the Spring Festival Sports Dance

the ﬁles of his department recently,
he un-earthed one of the most unu-
sual in the University's collection oil
out of the ordinary documents. 1

A little account book filled out inl

. ink and bearing the date of June 1,‘

1882, came_to light in his foraging.‘

I

complete inventory of the equipmentl

in the possession of the University,
when it was known as the Western‘,
‘University of Pennsylvania. g
The handwriting 1S thought to bel.
.1;-liat of President Wood, who ﬁfty-i
one years ago headed ‘WUP when it;
was located on it corner of Cherry’,
alley.
Eleven pages of the little- book are}
taken up wl.th entries. The entriesl
L-lleiilselves are particularly interest}
ing in comparing the University’s§
equipment then and now. ?

Apparently engineering was tallglltl
mainly by the use of small modelsl
ﬁfty-one years back. The book lists!
about 60 known "types" and about 20‘,
more of unknown varieties, The mod-’
els mentioned included miniature
bridges, pumps, steam engines, pro-
pellers. amalgamators, and other
types of engineering projects. Pro-
fessor lVI(‘,C:.lll(1'll‘S,S ad.nlit~ted that the
names of some of the equipment men-
ttloned were beyond him, declaring
that certain tools and macllinery were

i

thirty years ago.

Vvhen the compiler of the book set
about his duties, he decided to do
them up royally. In the listing of the
equipment ‘of’ foul-_of the rooms in
the Universitty building, he has men-
tioned such things as: one stove and
pipe; rubbers, pointer, and
board divide.rs_ poker and shov_el;
crllaudelier; coal box;,ou«tlinc map"of
Eu1'01)e (in 1882 it’ must have pre-
sented a pretty picture); one Greek
and ‘Latin Etymology; one theodolite;
and in one room were quartered one
dozen of thumb tacks.

In the front of the little book is
listed a number of abreviations with.
per centage statistics after them. If
interpretations of these abbreviations
and ﬁgures are correct, it appears
that 50 per cent of -the student body
at WUP in ’82..w-as composed of Pres-
byt.eria11.S: ,with
lians running a poor second at 15 per
cent. Other denominations seem to
hztve been: Episcopalians, 9 per
cent; Lutherans, 9 per cent; United
Presbyterians, 9 per cent; Baptists 5
per cent; and “Dis” (you guess) 3
per cent.

For all this information we are in-
debted to some ambitious i“aculty
member of WUP. President Wood, to
whom the work is attributed, is the%

l A On Our-Way Out: . . .

W ITH this issue, the Pitt News brings to a close its ﬁrst year of

publication as a seini-weekly newspaper.

Today the ineinbers

of its four-man executive board have performed their last adininis-
trative duties and relinquish their posts to a new editor and business

manager.

Tradition dictates. that at this particular time each year there’
should be much editorial lamentation from the outgoing staff heads.

So it has been in the past.

But just as the News broke this year with the “once a weekly,
alwaysa weekly ’ tradition, so would we break with this precedent
of sentiment, and with all others which tend to widen the breach be-
tween one year’s publication and the next. '

\Ve should like" our passing to be as quiet a transmission of

responsibility as the circumstances permit.

In so doing, one of the

chief disadvantages suffered by the college newspaper and its per-
sonnel—the annual change of ofﬁcers, and sometimes policy~—will be

minimized. ‘

Permitting personal reminiscences to go unspoken, the chief
hope of the retiring staff is that the University and its students will
continue to “look forward with the Pitt News.”

Silence from Uncle Sam on the matter of continued

support for ROTC units throughout the country leaves the ques-'

tion of whether or not the University is to have its Coast Artillery
Corps next year hanging in mid-air.

This week no reply had yet been received from the War Depart-
ment relative to the University ’s proposal to continue the campus
unit at the expense of the institution, in the event of a withdrawal

of Federal funds.

Only unformulated policy in VVashington could

have prevented the immedia.te endorsement of such a generous offer

by our econoinizing government.

If, in the event of withdrawal, the cost of sustaining the depart-
ment of military science and tactics were to exceed, relatively, the
University’s present investment, accrued through expenditures in
recent years, there would be no reason for assuming the added bur-
den. If, however, too great a. ﬁnancial loss were to be felt as a result
of the disbanding of the corps, and if the costs of maintaining the

unit were found to be, in fact, a.

saving" under these conditions,

coiitiiiuaiice by the University would not come as a surprise.

'\\='ith a slash in the legislature ’s biennial appropriation assured
and a faculty 1'€(lllCllOll inevitable, this is hardly the time to think _of
accepting the obligations which government itself has found too ex-

pensive.

‘We are, ﬁrst, a University, and last, a training camp.

An interesting statistical abstract of the activities of the
Uiiiversity YMCA during the past yearreveals the tremendous pro-
grain of service carried on by this undergraduate organization.
Sponsoringprojects that varied in character from campus-wide
assemblies to a. highly specialized program of freshman orientation,
the “Y,""' under the studied supervision of ‘W. \V. ll/lendenhall, exec-
utive secretary, and the able administration of its student officers,
has done a job that is deserving of praise from all of us who have

felt its beneﬁts.

 total of 1,147 sessions for all the various phases of YMCA
activity had drawn an approximate total attendance of 36,837 persons

on April 30.

Of these, 544 sessions were meetings for University
students, drawing an attendance of 27,971.

The sessions making up

the balance were part of a service program for needy men and boys

of the city cominunity.

Practically every one of our general assemblies, the several wor-

((

ship services, the

world education” assemblies, the regular meet-

ings of the Inquiry and similar clubs, and the valuable freshman
camp are all part of this orga.nizat.ion’s animal contribution to the

University.

The sum.total—for-1932-38 i.n particular, when the burden was

so much harder to beai'——rcpresents a job well done.

It is an un-

sought-for contribution for which every student can only be grateful.

THE PITT NEWS

9.. : OiO‘O

A

S THE day for the adjournment of Congress draws near, and the
ﬁrst phase of what Democrats call “Roosevelt "s program” takes

form, the resemblance of the measures already adopted or to be
adopted to the platform adopted at the Pitt political convention of

last fall becomes striking.

In some details the Roosevelt program and the platform of the

Pitt undergraduates differ.

But in general the same adherence to a

mild socialist program is evident in‘v%

both. Both assume a failure of the
Republican high tariff policy; both
advocate lower tariffs. On the prob-
lems of agriculture, prohibition, na-
tional economic planning, farm debt
relief, and war debts, the brain trusts
of the University of Pittsburgh and
the Roosevelt administration agree‘.
It is well enough known, of course,
that the measures which Roosevelt is
trying have been advocated for at
least the past two years by progres-
sives of the New Republic variety.
I would not credit Roosevelt with
any particular originality. His pro-
gram, formulated by university pro-

Ifessors. is exactly what one would ex-

pect of such men during these times.
Nothing Astounding

Neither did the Pitt students elec-
trify the world by their platform. It
was derived, generally, from senti-
ments and convictions exempliﬁed by
the college boy or girl, who regular-
ly reads the Nation and other period-
icals of that order. It was, perhaps,
frankly liberal, but only faintly ‘tinged,
at the most with radicalism.

The Pitt students, who took part
in last year's convention, were typ-
ical of the sort that attend most
large metropolitan universities and
display any interest at all in social
affairs. Drawn from the upper and
middle class bourgeois elements in
this country. their habits of thought
are inevitably conditioned by their
background and their origins. As a
result, they are fairly progressive and
somewhat informed-, but their ideas

on the outmoded institutions of na-A

tionalism. ownership of property, and
clan descent are in agreement with
those possessed by their fathers and
inotuhers.

It is it mistake to believe that the
modern American student has made
a complete break with the past in
his economic and political ideas, His
theories are progressively in line with
those held by students, twenty years
ago, and the line of descent of their
ideas may be traced without too much
difﬁculty.

‘New York Radicalism

The only students in America who,
en masse, have shown real. radical
proclivities are those in the New York
universities. There the students are
derived mainly from poor, laboring
classes and thus, unhainpered by bour-
geois tradition, they align themselves
with what they consider to be pro-
letarian movements. And, having
little stake in the present economic
order, they are willing to organize
and make their protests without par-,
ticular fear of consequences.

And it is these same New York
.studen'ts w-lio have really displayed,_
as a group, a vital intellectual curios-
ity iii the institutions which sur-
round them. There are. of course,
intellectuals at universities through-
out the country who attempt to amass
as much knowledge as possible. But,
in general, students outside Columbia,
New York University and City Col-
lege of New York, have displayed a
modicum of the questing spirit, And,
above all, they have shown no de-
sire to make American institutions
conform to their theories.

As to whether an awakening of
students in America. would result in
an intelligent movement, it is difficult
to predict. German students are 0011‘
sidered to be among the most inter-
ested groups in the world, and yet,
at present. they are supposedly sup-
porting with heart and soul the Hit-
ler movement. It is entirely possible
that American students would do the
same thing, if they became social
crusaders.

It will be interesting to note the-
actions of students from the farm
belt, now that the farmers are in re-
volt. Will the students swing with
their brethren? Or will the college
education h-ave a deadening inﬂuence
upon them so that they merely lean
back in desk chairs and gaze out over
the horizon with blank eyes.

Farm students. of course, have al-
ways been regarded as the dumbest.
most complacent. bovine group of stu-
dentsany where. They were always
looked upon as peasants doing their
best to gain a little polish. It is pos-
sible, nevetheless, that they will join
in the farm evolt and back to the lim-
it their fathers and brothers.

Depression Effects

If the business slump should con-
tinue and present indeﬁnite signs of
renewed industrial activity should
prove to mean nothing, then the sit-
uation of a possible student move-
inent will be different. For students,
since they come. in the majority of

instances, from ‘wellto-do families,
were hit by the depression later than
the industrial group. Therefore, they
showed no concern until lately and
their -late concern was very imma-
teri-al.

‘I-Iowever, if the depression con-
tinues a student movement of some
proportions, is at least possible. The
difﬁculty here is that the movement,
it it ever comes, and that is doubtful.
will probably be directed towards a
modiﬁcation of existing institutions
and not a complete and thorough re-
organization.

For instance, I cannot believe that
any student movement that may arise
would not be content with a mere
redistribution of property, instead of
attempting to do away wtih owner-
ship coniplete_ly. The degree of lib-
eralism or radicalism of any student

movement will depend upon the con-

ditions ot‘ business at the time.

One may desire a radical student
movement, but mere desire does not
bring actuality. And desire of long
standing without fulﬁllment is likely
to ultimately result in disillusionment
and cynicism. And that is what those
who ardently wish for an awakening
of the American students usuall-y
reach. A state of disgust with the
mind and disillusionment

within a student movement.

First Summer School
Paper Issued July 7

The ﬁrst issue of the Pitt Summer
News, publication of the University
Summer Session, will appear Friday,
July 7, according to an announcement
made today by F. VV, Shockley, di-
rector of the summer school.

The paper will appear at ten-day
intervals during the six weeks’ term,
and will be edited by the ofﬁce of the
University Editor.

Pitt Observatory
' Aids In World’s
Fair Novelty

 
 

The University will have an iin-
portant part in presenting one of
the outstanding oddities of the
World's Fair at Chicago this suin-
mer. At the Allegheny Observa-
t0rY. a part of the University,
electric equipment known as an
“electric eye,” has been set up
with the Observatory’s giant tele-

' scope to catch light coming from
the star Arcturus, 240 trillion
miles away. By means of this “elec-
tric eye,” and the telescope at
the Observatory, the star’s light
will be received and changed into
electric energy, which will be
transmitted to Chicago, and re-
cast as light by reflectors upon
the tower of the Science Building.

'1‘he motive of the project is to
use the same light that started
from Arcturus at the close of the
Chicago VVorld’s Fair of 1893. On
May 27 the telescope will focus
on the star, and the equipment
will begin to work,

The “electric eye” has been
planned and installed by Dr.
Frank C. Jordan, head of the Ob-
servatory and Professor of As-
tronomy at the University and Dr.
Phillip Thomas, an engineer of
the Westinghouse Co. The work
is being carried on with the co-
operation of the University of
Illinois, of Harvard, and of the
Yerkes Observatory.

C. W.E. Miller To Speak
At Philologists’ Banquet

Dr. Charles W. E. Miller, Professor
of Greek at Johns Hopkins Univer-
sity and editor of the American Jour-
nal of Philology, will be guest speak-
er at the third annual banquet of the
Philological Society of the Univer-
sity, to take place in the French room
of Hotel Schenley, Saturday night, ac-
cording to Dr. Evan T. Sage, presi-
dent-

One of the leading classicists of the
nation, Dr. Miller is the author of
several monographs, reports, and re-
views in the ﬁeld of classical philol-
ogy, including the authoritative “Syn-
tax of Classical Greek from Homer
to Demosthenes.” He is a member
of the American Philological Associa-
tion, the Classical Association, the
Archaeological Institute of America,
the American Classical League, and
the Linguistic Society of America.

A desire to stimulate and promote
research in literature and linguistics
on the Pitt campus and environs was
responsible for the creation of the
local society three years ago.

A Literary Magazine
For a long time now, a real need has been felt on the University

campus for a representative literary magazine.

People from other

colleges learn with surprise that we have no such publication. Thev

insist that the lack is a large and unusual one.

And we agree with

them. Certainly no small town college or denominational school but

has something in the nature of a literary sheet.

State Universities

especially emphasize this side of student activities, contribute funds

toward its realization,-and fi'equently%

offer substantial prizes for the most
meritorious contributions. Here, how-_
ever, we have nothing of that. Prizes
of no sort are offered as encourage-
ment; seldom, indeed, does any stu-
dent work reach print.

There have been those few excep-
tions, to be sure. Last year saw the
publication of a “literary number” by
the campus humor magazine, The
effort was noble and, doubtless, the
editors were motivated by the recog-
nition of this need; but the result was
abortive and ordinary, The material
in no way represented the best cre-
ative work being done at the Univer-
sity, the staff members ﬁgured largely
in the space occupied, and taste and
restraint gave way to ﬂamboyant illus-
trations and advertisement. One
could see clearly the foot behind, try-
ing vainly to ape the walk of the
courtier. In the end, it did more
harm than good.

Steps, on the other hand, is the
only campus publication that really
encourages creative writing. Its
standards are of the highest sort, and,
being open to graduates and faculty
members as well as undergraduates,
more and more it has narrowed to
faculty achievements, with the result
that student work has been increas-
ingly restricted. This, in our point
of view, is the fault of Steps, or
rather its limitation. Somewhere in
the fortunate medium between the
two types of publication mention lies
a body of representative undergradu-
ate achievement and the possibility of
a magazine which would express such
creative effort.

With this belief in mind, Quill Club
has undertaken the publication of
The Journeyman. Quill Club is a rep-
resentative group of undergraduates
at the University engaged in creative
writing, The body of work it pro-
duces is, without doubt, the most rep-
resentative body of creative writing be-
ing done at the University. So from
every point of view the organization
feels certain this magazine will stand
with those of other schools as repre-
sentative of its background.

No illustrious illusions are enter-
tained in it. The Journeyman D1‘0'

Twelve good and true journalists

Ofﬁce of the dean of men. VI/‘hen this
issue was put to bed yesterday after-
noon, ten men and two women had
culminated their careers as ointment
in the ﬂywheels of the oﬁicial under-
graduate newspaper.

Most of them were part of the

pounds no theory of writing, supports
no experiment——otl1er than the aspira-
tioual experiment all literature em-
barks upon—noi- does it hold that its
contents are of markedly superior
quality. It tries only to present to
those few interested in Quill Club's
activities, a representative body of
work being done. The only standard
set has been that of realized experi-
ence.

VVe feel that the writing included
has, almost without exception, realized
creatively something of the experi-
ence of living, has gathered from the
reservoirs of mind and memory
something of genuine signiﬁcance and
made it manifest. To be sure, the sub-
jects are most often common things.
But in this age when the larger, tra-
ditional issues of life are disintegrat-
ing beneath the impact of fresh knowl-
edge, our old values sliding away, our
new unformed, it is the common
things that come back to us most
warm, most intimate.

A tree with sunlight upon it, a.
pond, a new-turned ﬁeld, a star, a
friend, these are the things around
which life seems to revolve. For
however ﬁerce our endeavor to settle
the larger issues of living, always we
come back to these. And in doing so,
we need never apologize.

We hope The Journeyman will be
received in this light by our friends.
Because we have printed it privately,
the issue has been restricted to ﬁve
hundred copies. Any one wishing to
secure a copy can do so from a mem-
ber of the Club. The price is only
twenty-ﬁve cents.

Opens Monday

 

Cathedral Smoking-Room Finished
Under WSGA Rooms Group

Decorated in orange, green and
black tapestries, and furnished with
green divans and wicker chairs, not to
mention a generous supply of orange
pillows, the new lounge and smoking-
room in 812 Cathedral of Learning

niture from the Faculty Club, the
space has been transformed from an
office-room into a rest retreat for the
girls.

The Rooms Committee is planning
to provide another such room in 111
Thaw Hall in the near future, while
tentative plansfor a women's lounge
and smoking room‘ in Alumni hall for
next year are also being considered.

time, not the number of germs in a
bottle of mouth wash. _ Rather, it is
the number of different ‘bridge hands
that it is possible to build up with a
deck containing ﬁfty-two cards.

To make mattersworse, a combina-
tion of the 635 billion possible hands
of one player with the number of pos-
sible hands which may be held by the
other three players can produce more
than 53,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,-
OOO combinations.

The cause of it all is the fact that
Dr. J. S. Taylor is supervising the
work of postgraduate students at Pitt
in developing the game of bridge ac-
cording to mathematical formulae.
In the process, there are more ﬁgures
on the black board than on the stage
of the Follies Bergere. To complicate
matters still more, two students, Miss
Lillian Goldstein and Miss Eva Jane
Griﬁith are earning masters’ degrees
this year by the simple process of

converting contract bridge from a

shin-kicking pastime to the ﬁeld of
higher mathematics.

“Of course, contract bridge cannot .

be strictly a mathematical game,” ex-
plains Dr. Taylor. “Psychological fac-
tors, the memory factor, and the de-
ductions from the bidding play a role
the importance of which is great; but,
if one has a rather deﬁnite notion of
the mathematical probability of card
combinations, his game should be ma-

terially improved.” If this doesn’t ex-
plain things clearly, call Dr. Taylor
up some morning, about four o'clock,
and ask for particulars.

However, research conducted by Dr,
Taylor and the graduate students
serves as a check on values allotted
to hands by alleged-bridge experts.
In ﬁgures obtained at the University,
standard values given to low card
hands by bridge authorities have ap-
parently been set too high in some
instances, while those for high card
hands have been underestimated. If
the ﬁgures of the Pitt mathematician
are ‘accepted, it may become neces-
sary to revive the value tables which
have set the standards since the
memorable Lenz-Culbertson scrap two
years ago.

Both the Misses Goldstein and
Griffith will be granted their master
of science degrees this summer.
Asked the standard question, if they
enjoyed bridge, the reply in chorus
was, “We don't make a habit of play-
ing it, There is really too much
ﬁguring to it. Give us a problem In
quarternions any time.” Which
means absolutely nothing to one who
has been trying for years to ﬁnd a
mathematician to compute the answer
to “VVho was that thar lady I seen
you with last night?”

Pitt Men, Women
Debaters Stage
I02 Contests

An unofﬁcial world's record for
number of debates was estab-
lished by the University of Pitts-
burgh debating associations dur-
ing the past season’, a. check-up
a.t the debating foffice has re-
vealed. With twenty-eight foren-
sic contests participated in by
the Women’s group and sixty-
eight by the men, the grand total
reached was 102. j
; Fifty-three discussions took
place with other universities of the
Northeast, South,’ and Middle-
west, while ﬁfty-nine were exten-
sion debates, Pitt representing
both sides. Of the intercollegiate
tilts thirty-seven were staged on
the nine trips which debaters
made at various times throughout
the year. Two major tours, one
down through Dixie as far as
Florida, and one East to New
York, were taken by teams of
the lV[en’s Debating Association;
the women not to be outdone
sent a team West to Wisconsin
when it took part in a. national
forensic tournament.

YM Summarizes
Year’s Activities

 

Charlesworth, Mendenhall, Phelps,
Rev. Bleakney Speak Tuesday

 

The annual report and installation
banquet of the YMCA took place last
Tuesday evening in the Church of
the Ascension, and featured a sum-
mary of the year's activities carried

on by the “Y." Arthur Charlesworth,
retiring president_ of the cabinet,
gave his valedictory, and William

Mendenhall, director, quoted ﬁgures
on the attendance and the range of
“Y” activities. .

Dr. Harold A. Phelps, professor of
sociology, outlined the work of Boys’
Club sponsors. The eighteen new
members of the Cabinet were pre-
sented, and pointed out the work
they expect to do in 1933-34. Ralph
W. Harbison, president of the Board
of Directors of the Pittsburgh YMCA,
led the installation’ ceremony. The
Rev. Edward F. Bleakney delivered
the installation address.

Dr. S. B. Linhart, secretary of the
University, presided over the meet-
ing, which was attended by students,
faculty members, trustees, and promi-
nent business men of the city.

BROWN

Counted Out

Among those to be missing when
the whistle blows for games begin-
ning next year include the players
pictured here. Football loses the
most number of men, 10 in all, with

turn.

The annual June graduations can
only mean one thing as far as Pitt’s
coaches are concerned, namely the
fact that more work than ever W11]
be necessary to replace the seasoned
veterans who have completed their al-
lotted three years of varsity competi-
tion.

Needless to say, the fact that three
years of varsity competition does not
necessarily graduate an athlete, but
the results of graduation and the ex-
piration of eligibility are quite the
same. As usual, the football tea.m
will be hardest hit, losing ten men
from this year's squad. The boxing
team faces the loss of three perform-
ers, the basketball squad two, the
tennis team three, the track team
three and the swimming -team none.

. The fact that Heller, Reider, Dailey,
Tormey, Cuba, Seig-cl, Cutri, Brown,
Sekay, and Schindehutte will be miss-
ing from the Pitt roster next year
should do anything but smooth the
path of Coach Sutherland next year.
All of the above mentioned will be
hard to replace as each one had been
on the squad since their freshman
year. The loss of Heller will be ex-
tremely hard to replace, as the dyn-
amic All-American halfback performed
everything that a one-man football
team is supposed to do.

Replacing Tormey at center ﬁnds
another hard spot on the program.
Only the fact that Ralph Daugherty
was present kept Tormey from the
regular berth. Mentioned on many
all—opponei1t teams, ’l‘0rmey would be
-more than welcome were he able to
‘play another season. The remaining
eight gridders were dependable
throughout the year, and although all
were not varsity men, they did more
than their share in giving Pitt an-
other great football team. The addi-
tion of any grey hairs or frowns on
the Sutherland physiognomy can be
easily explained by the remembrance
that ten good men will not be back
for the 1933-34 season. _

Captain Francis Seigel, Harry
Conte, a.nd George Gambatese will not
be among those present when the
next Panther boxing season rolls
around. The loss of Seigel deprives
the Pittsburgh boxing public of an op-
portunity to see the most colorful
collegiaii in the country, a ﬁghter in
every sense of the word. Seigel, al-
ways known as a hard puncher, will
be missed next year, and will leave
the 165 pound division wide open.
Gambatese and Conte, both feather-
weights, leave that division vacant by
their graduation. Although Gambatese
held the varsity position for the
greater part of the season, he could
always look around and see Conte be-

liind him. Conte was one of the orig-
inal members of the Pitt boxing team,
and altihougli giving away weight in
every ﬁght, always went the distance.

Don Smith and Rocco Cutri will be
missing when the annual “VVin ’em
All” cry sounds in the pavilion.
Smith's value need not be re-me1i-
tioned here, as it is quite widely
known. Cutri, who proved himself
good enough to crash through the var-
sity liiieup has the distinction of not
playing until the close of the football
season, and then winning a. varsity
award in the sport. His bulk and
speed proved valuable when the going
got rough,

track talent.

The swimming team is the only
major team that does not lose a per-
former by graduation. This fact,
combined with the statistics that
show Pitt to have one of the best
swimming teams in the east will
likely result in a group of human
seals that will be practically invin-
cible in dual competition next year.

ﬁve high schools in this vicinitv chal-
lenged each other in athletic contests,
danced, sang, and staged stunts Sat-
urday, May 13, in Trees Gym.
Invited to the annual Playday by

the physical education department, the
hlgh school students became acquaint-
ed with the athletic opportunities of:
the University_ At 1:30 o'clock, attei-I
t1_1e_.V had registered, the girls were
dwlded NW0 eight color teams under
the 19?1fl€l'ShiD of physical education
majors, then the group carried _out a.
program Of gym W0I'k, swimming, and
stunts. Between periods of games,

the Telwesentatives of the high school
Sang. Camp songs and gave School
cheers.

' Point-S Were given to the various
color teams for the sports in which
they excelled. The light blue team.
headed by Frances Dent, ’35, gathered

ins mostl.v _in the individual Cllal-'
,lenges in swimming, such as log-
rolling and spin-the~top.

Stunts, preseiited during the 3

o’clock assembly, proved to be the
outstanding part of the rainy day pro-
.‘<*ram. A depiction of the story of
Pocalioiitas as never presented be-
fore, by Charlotte l\lad_v’s group,
placed first. The girls gave the story
in pantoinime with sound effects, por-
trayiiig literal translations of ﬁgures
ot speech. The gargling brook al-
most resulted in the ﬂooding of the
stage. Other teams also gave clever
skits, such as the romance of AB and
QT. a tale told entirely in letters of

The Water May Not Look
Fine But It Has Cured
‘‘Athlete’s Foot”

Three hundred ﬁt'tyVt'reslimen are
taking the place of guinea pigs in the
interests of science this week. Sci-
ence, in the giiise of Drs, H. ()7. Carl-
son and George Kowallis of Student
Health Service, is testing the el"1:'ects
of a. solution on epidermipliytosis, or,
in the patois of the hoi polloi, Ath-
letes’ Foot. ’

The gallant members of the host
are the ones who reported themselves

 

as sul’t'ering l'rom the foot malady
wlieii they entered school last fall.
For their relief the solution was

placed at the. eiitrance to the showers
in ’.l‘i'ees G_vni. Directions for its use
were posted and the men were ex-
pected to use the preventative wlien-
ever they took gyni or swimming.
Barring those ever-present souls who
feel constitutionallyinclined to cut
phys ed, the subjects were thronging
the Falk Clinic all this week to report
on the progress of their own personal
cure.

Results were varied. Some. reported
themselves as completely freed from
the menace, others as only partially
relieved, while one intractable victim
said he didn't use it because it felt
“too stick_v." Since the preparation
consistedol’ about 99. per cent water,
that lad must have used an overdose
of imagination, according to the docs.

\Vlii1e all the results of tlie‘treat-
nieiit have not been correlated. D1‘-
Carlson stated that they were highly
satisfactory.

the seventeen standard life saving
tests at Trees Pool this week to qual-
ity as senior American Red Cross lite
savers.

1\lea.nwhile, many other mermaids.
of the University are busy practicing.
surface dives, treading water, ap-
pioaches and carries, breaking of the
various death holds of drowning per-
sons. and other resuscilatmg abilities
required in life saving.

Tests are being run off regularly
under the supervision of Mrs. Fran-
ces Tracy, instructor in Physical Ed-
ucation, who is a qualiﬁed senior ex-
aminer. Special exaiiiiiiatioiis for
women who will iieetl their se-
nior rankings to secure summer
camp positions will be given on
the afternoon of May 29, 30, and 31
at the pool from 1:30 to 3:30 o’clock.
Repeated failure to pass any one of
the seventeen tests will withhold sen-
ior ranking: and the accompanying
bat-lllng suit emblem from a swiniiuer.

The nine who have passed their

WEDNESRAY, MAY 24.1933
Hay Ride Speeds  
Senior Farewel

 

Graduating Coeds Bade Goodbye
with WAA Picnic Supper

 

WAA bade farewell to the seniors
yesterday—-not with sad and mourn-
fur ceremony, but with a hay ride to
Frick ‘Woods.

The party was a surprise to the
guests. ‘While they were discussing
the possibilities, the women were sur-
prised to see a large truck loaded
with hay stop in front of State Hall.
The members of the committee and
‘many underclassmen, dressed in over-
alls, greeted the group and helped
them into the hay.

After a picnic supper. the women.
-played such games as “The String and
the Ring” and guessing riddles. The
seniors themselves helped with the]-
mitertainnient by making each senior
pull a card out of a hat and do what
the card instructed. _

Following the program, a white
pique purse was presented to Mary!
Lou Mc-Connell, retiring VVAA D1951“,
.dent. Virginia Negley, Ed. ’34. the:
new president, in giving the present,[
thanked Mary Lou for her work and
achievements in VVAA for the Past
:year.

The hay ride was arranged by Jane
M(-.Namara, Ed, '34, and her commit-
tee, Virginia Negley. Ed. ’3-1; Fannie
Hirsch, Ed. '34. and Vera Kost. Ed.

Pitt

Bits 

The last issue usually ﬁnds a sports
writer, or a.n alleged writer, fast ap-
proaching a condition that borders
between insanity and repentance. The
insanity is easily explained, but it
seems out of the ordinary to repent
because of what was written through-
out the school year-.

On the level, there was truth,
in some form or other in all the
matter printed in this column.
That is, as far as the secret oper-
atives were able to "ascertain. It
is hoped, that with this beginning
what,follows may be forgiven, or
forgotten.

This week will see the last of the
present generation of the tennis play-
ing O’Loughlin family playing for
Pitt. Bill O’Loughlin is the last of
the line. He follows in the footsteps
of his brothers, Dave and John. The
three brothers have been the ranking
members of the Panther tennis teams
as long as they participated in the
sport.

Incidentally, Billy O’Loughlin
and ‘Nate. G309". number one and
two men, may be sent to the
intercollegiate matches in Phila-
delphia_ If the boys are sent, Phila-
delphia will see them in action
during the last week of June.
Playing as doubles partners, or in
the singles matches, both boys
stand a good chance of crashing
through.

The fact that several veterans
played on the first string aggregation
throughout the spring practice ses-
sions does not necessarily mean that
they will occupy the same posts dur-
ing the training camp periods or in
the fall when the season opens. This
is especially true in at least two of
the backﬁeld positions, and likely on
the line as well.

Wrestling and boxing seem to

have been desertedas far as Pitt
is concerned. The abolition of
the 15 per cent state tax on both
sports would lead one to believe
that the sport would boom, but as
yet. no mention of schedules for
either team has been made. Both
sports could be made quite profit-
able if handled correctly as there
is nothing the -average man likes
to see than two other people hold-
ing a glorified adagio dance.
The subject of the football cap-
taincy is a.n interesting one. The nia-
terial for the position is quite (liver-
siﬁed, consisting of both backs and
linemen. Several of the candidates
have been regulars since their sopho-
more years, while others never crashed
through until last season. Whether
the captain is elected by the players
or appointed by the coach may have
some inﬂuence on the playing of the
team as a whole. ,

The return trip from Notre
Dame was anything but joyful to
several members of the Pitt track
team. It seems that several of the
boys had dates scheduled for Sat-
urday evening, and the bus left

for Pittsburgh immediately after

the meet. And an interesting

“date" was had in Washing_to'n by

the tennis team. Come up some

time. ,

Trader Horns, Bull Necks, and
Punch Drunks have invaded these
columns with an alarming degree of
regularity, and it might alleviate sus-
picion to explain just why it happen-
ed. It seems that there were, and
are, three stuck-up athletes, who think
they t0D their field. The best way to
bring them down to eartli is to keep
‘boosting them and then tell them tliat
unless they get over their swell—liead-
edness, they will soon be on the out-
side.

As far as weather is concerned,
the tennis team will be quite sat-
isfied if they never see another
season like the present. Rain
washed out most of the matches.
and prevented any degree of pram
tice sessions. Which meant, that
the team's record was not as good
as had been expected.

The last paragraph. Somewhat of
a preview of next year's program. In
all probability. the Campus Scout
will be recalled from stud to replace
a decaying PI'l".l‘ BITS. An improve-
ment, even if it's terrible. (Author's
Note-—-This last paragraph was. not
written by me.)

Despite the fact that Jack
Schricker has dropped boxing
until ‘next year, an item will ap-
pear_ in the downtown papers
every so often announcing his
appearance against someone or
Othel‘. This may be all right, but
some one is asking for something
when he does things like that. '
Amei'ica.’s loss is someone else's

gain. Somebody said that at some
time or other, and I think it could
apply to the case of the vanishing
All-American girl. After renouncing
all eiitanglements. the one and only
has gotten married.

The rumor persists, however,
that the word, “obey" was omit-
ted from the ceremony. Which
simply means that all hope is not
lost. I'm still waiting for the in-
vitation to partake of a bridal
dinner. After all, the free pub-
licity is really worth something.
Several complaints have been re-

ceived about the fact that two boys
are mentioned quite frequently in
these columns. As far as the boys
go, everything is ok, b-ut the cash cus-
tomers must have their say. once in
awhile. Therefore. be it resolved that
wrestlers and Traders be kept from
these columns for the duration of the
term. »

The recent State Amateur box-
ing championships, which _vve're
held at the stadium, attracted
what amounted to about the
smallest possible entry list for
any major tournament The cash
customers were ‘few. and the con-
tenders were fever. Somebody
lost on the deal.

Typical of Western Electric care and precision

making of the transmitter button which trans‘forn7s

This transmitter button—-the telep‘hone’s vocal

  Social Trips

 

Students Will ,Visit " City
Slums in Summer Tour"

,—

A month’s ﬁrs-t-hand experience in
“underprivileged ’ tenement settle-
mentsain the city's slums, strip dis-
tricts, and industrial sections” is any
s'tudent’s for the asking. A Student
Inquiry into the Eﬂects of Social and
Economic Forces is planned for this
summer by the Middle Atlantic Inter-
collegiate Councils of the YMCA and
YWCA.

The ﬁrst ﬁve days of the Inquiry
which starts June 26- and ends Au-
gust 4,'are to be devoted to an orien-
tation‘ session. This period, accord-
ing to W. W. Mendenhall, secretary,
is to present a composite idea of what
the ‘students are to expect in later
work.

Immediately following the introduc-
tory session, volunteers will be as-
signed to various agencies—settle-
ment houses, recreation groups with
playgrounds and pools, family case
work, clubs, and surveys of deﬁnite
conditions. They will work in con-
junction with -experienced supervisors,
and to assist their interpretation of
their experiences, the students will
meet every week for forums, discus-
sions, and trips to Juvenile Court,
Mayview, and neighborhood factories.

Innormal times, workers received
room and meals for their services,
but it was impossible to guarantee
these terms for this year. Arrange-
ments are to be made with. each
agency and will depend partly upon
what the student can doand partly
upon the ﬁnancial condition of the co-
operating agency. Students will, how-
ever, need car fare for trips of ob-
servation during the ﬁrst session and
for travel to and from Work, for
group meetings and trips during the
month. The registration fee for the
entire. Inquiry is $5.00; for the intro-
duction session. only $2.00. .

Four principles have been set down
by the committee as inﬁuencing.the
summer schedule: To help students
get an authentic insight into the kind
of world in which they are living; to
learn by ﬁrst-hand observation and
experience the effect on human per-
sonality, of social and economic
forces; to enable students to render
signiﬁcant service; and to help stu-
dents to plan their college course and
future life work in reference to a
new quality of leadership demanded
by modern society.

Dr. Harold A. Phelps, professor of
sociology,.is a member of. the advi-.
sory committee; Marjorie Hanson,
Col. ’34, and King. Derr, Col. '35, are
student members of the Inquiry Com-
mittee.

Scott Completes
Fresco ForRooms

 

Avinoﬁ‘ Designed Byzantine Motif
Used for Cathedral Work

Henry E. Scott, assistant professor
in the ﬁne arts department, has re-
cently ﬁnished a large fresco in the
ofﬁces of Mrs. Ruth C. Mitchell, chair-
man of the nationality rooms in the
Cathedral. The fresco was designed

by Dr. Audrey"‘Avinoff, head of the

Carnegie Museum, and assistant pro-
fessor of ﬁne arts.

The fresco was done on a wet plas-
ter medium with earth-pigment colors,
and is a reproduction of an ancient
Byzantine motif—a picture of a youth-
ful knight overcoming the dragon of
evil, much like the English “St.
George Slaying the Dragon.” "This
picture was ﬁrst employed as an ikon
in Russia in the twelfth and thir-
teenth centuries and contains all of
thesymbolic features of such art.
The knight is clothed in a red robe,
the red of martyrdom. He rides a
graceful white horse, with the tall
thin legs, the arched neck, and the
small, well-shaped head of Persian
horses. Tiny rocks indicate moun-
tains, and the serpent is a fanged,
writhing monster.

This fresco is exactly like those
that have been reproduced by nearly
all the masters, in color, composition,
and ﬁgures, A tapestry copy of it is
intended for the Russian Room and
Mr. Scott intends to paint another 111
Mrs. Mitchell’s oﬂice to match the one
designed by Dr. Avinoff. Motion pic-
tures were made ofthe work on the
fresco during_ its construction.

Why Not c’mup sometime?

 

Engineers Recline on Couches, Watch Ball Games.-_‘ from
Cathedral; Will Ask to Have Bleachers Removed

 

By Reuben Slesinger

Once upon a time there was a group
of very busy (?) students who spent
several hours a day in a huddle in the
metallurgy department library. For
several days, it was believed by those

But, one day the secret leaked out!
They were watching the ball game,
and according to the best of authori-
ties it is a better place than Flagstaﬁ
Hill.

Just leave it up to those metallurgy
and chemical enginering studes to‘
ﬁnd ways and means of passing their
courses. Up in the hill building,
blackjack was the password; then un-
til disclosed in the new hideout in
the Cathedral, poker occupied their
minds. But, now baseball is in vogue.
And, don’t think that you can’t win
anything watchin’ a base ball game!
(The latest quotations a.re two to one
that Traynor will hit and a hundredf
to one that you won’t collect.) I

Bill Daufenbach Removes
Distributors From Cars ~ ”
Parked On Line

A combination of yellow lines, “No
Parking” signs, and.Bill Daufenbach
equals parked cars minus distribu-tors.
Therefore, beware of a man with sag-
ging pockets. He’s dangerous. I-Ie’ll
stop at nothing to get a distributor.
His name is Daufenbach. However,
there’s a reason behind the skull-
duggery.

All in all, it seems that the Univer-
sity officials are in earnest about
their “No Parking” signs. The fact
has often been stressed that, _should
there be a ﬁre, the engines would, in
all probability, damage the parked
cars.

As most of the student parking is
done on Alumni Drive, the“ No Park-
ing” signs placed there have been
disregarded by those desiring a place
to leave their cars. To impress the
fact that parking will not be permit-
ted, the policy of removing distribu-
tors has been announced. The fun-
loving Mr. Daufenbach delights in
watching a student hunt him up for
the missing part, living up to the
motto, “Make ’em hunt at least two
hours.”

When the distributor has been re-
turned to the offender, a lecture is
given (free) for the ﬁrst offense. A
ticket is given for the second offense.
The stubs from these tickets are turn-
ed in to the department of Buildings
and Grounds and kept on ﬁle. Action
will be taken on second-time offend-
ers when necessary. , .

Women’s Association Ends
Year With Picnic June‘ 2

A real old-fashioned picnic will be
the last event of this season for the
Womenfs Association on Friday, June
2. The event is scheduled for 4 o’clock"
at the Schenley Park Athletic Shelter
House. Families are requested to
bring their own food and dishes; ice
cream and coffee will be distributed
by* the Junior Activities Committee
which .is in charge of the affair. A
program of games has been planned
for all those present. Those plan-
ning to attend are asked to bring
their own horse shoes, quoits, volley-
ball sets, etc. In case of rain, the pic-
nic will be cancelled.

The following are members of the
Junior Activities _C‘om_i_nittee: Mrs.

George E, Jones, Mrs. Stewart Phil-
lips, Mrs. B. J. Hobbe, Mrs. P. E. Har-_

ris, Mrs. P. Heald, Mrs. Vlﬁhitede, Mrs."

merous Aivsummer social 3:

are thinking of sending a petition to
the Pittsburgh Base Ball Club to have
the left wing of the Forbes Field
stands removed because it hides the
batter and third base. But, according
to the management so few of the op-
posing players ever reach that far
that the spongers are missing nothing.

Not content to sit in hard class-
room chairs, these chiselers have pro-
vided two divans for those who would
have their comfort .even‘ when it
comes down to sitting on“-a tack.

The boys, (?) furthermore -have re-
served their seats. The mightiest re-
cline on thecouches while the weak
strain their necks (rubber ones).

A system of intercommunication be-
tween rooms so that those who have
classes can also see the games is" be-
ing planned. Any helpful suggestions
will unwillingly be received and a re-
ward offtwo cents in silver will be
furnished.‘ ' ~ __ »

It is getting now so thatthey can
recognize 5the players by the way they
spit their tobacco and by the way
they sneeze._ ' ‘ - » _
