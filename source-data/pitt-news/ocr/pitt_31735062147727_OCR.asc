uled for March 27th at Carnegie
Music Hall, but the ﬂood caused a
postponement of the affair until Mon;

hookup, loca.l music followers will‘ be

tigating Committee; Dr. Bernard C.

crete expression of campus opinion on
the subject of war, and it will be a
counterpart of many similar meetings
to be held during the same hour at
most of the schools throughout the
country. During that period it is es-
timated that over three hundred thou-
sand students will leave their classes
to participate in some form of demon-
stration against war.

On Weather Today

On both sides of Forbes Street to-
day, there is much hoping for good
weather.

Candidates for election realize
that the warmer the weather, the
more votes cast. And the more
votes cast, the easier will be the
road to election. History has no
record of an unconﬁdent candidate.

A nice day will likely see an exo-
dus of students later in the after.
noon to watch the Pirates in the
home opener. '

If Old Sol! shines -all day, scores
of candidates will render thanks.
And so will Mr, Benswanger.

Cap And Gown Taps
Four At Annual Smoker

Four men were tapped into the un-
dergraduate Cap and Gown club at a
smoker given by the graduate club at
the Y I-Iut Wednesday night. The tap-
pees are: Wilson Griffiths, BA37.
Charles Bucher, C36, Joseph Madden.
C36, and William Davis, C37.

Each of the four men have had three
years of service in Cap and Gown.

Qonger than ever before, is expected to

file into the polls in Memorial Hall
between 9:30 and 5:45 o’clock to bal-
lot on candidates for election to the
Student-Facull.y Assembly, the Col-
lege Association, and the newly-
formed Men’s Council.

Many of the “old stagers,” who fol-
low the elections with little less avid-
ity than a sophomore follows a pretty
coed, see the extended voting time as
a. “break” for the political faction
which has a large voting strength in
those schools having late classes. par-
ticularly the School of Dentistry. Ru-
mors indicate that a. swing back to
the old Alpha regime, out of power
for two years, is a possibility, with
the ﬂaring up again of the one-time
Alpha and Beta coalitions

No Results Until Tomorrow

Local job printers have been work-
ing overtime to print the vari-colored
cards which list the several “slates”
with which virtually all of the candi-
dates have become aligned in some
way or other. Fourteen of the 60 seek-
ing election to SFA have drawn up
platforms indicating the principles
they intend to follow if elected. These
are listed elsewhere on this page.

Most important in the voting proce-
dure this year will be each student’s
p-resenting of 'a proper identiﬁcation
card before he is admitted to the polls.
The regular registration card will suf-
ﬁce, although if the student has for-
gotten it he may apply at the office of
the dean of men in Room 801, Cathe-.
dral, or at the office of the dean of
women in Heinz House to secure a.
substitute card.

Besides predicting the heaviest cam-
pus vote in years. Charles Ebert, C,
chairman of elections, indicates that
the ba.1lot boxes will remain closed un-
til tomorrow morning, and no returns
will be available until then.

First Men’s Council Election

The ﬁrst elections for the Univer-
sity Men’s Council. slated to become
active next fall, will add another bal-
lot to the voting procedure today. For
the College, two men will be selected
from the three upper classes; for the
School of Business Administration,
one man will be selected from each of
the classes; for the School of Engi-
neering, one junior and one senior
will be elected; the Schools of Mines
and of Education will elect one man.

Ten senior and ten junior men,
along with ﬁve senior and ﬁve junior
women will gain posts in SFA. College
Association Cabinet. positions to be
ﬁlled toda.y are president, vice presi-
dent, secretary_ and treasurer.

years, the candidates will be inter-
viewed at 1:30 o'clock on next Tues-
day and Wednesday afternoons. Un-
der the new constitutional amendment,
the honorary sophomore organization
will tap 15 men on May 1 instead of
the usual 12.

Faculty Committees Hold Interviews

F or 119 School of Education Applicants

Committees composed of faculty
members of the School of Education

and the College are now interviewing
119 applicants for admission to the
School of Education.

The 15-minute interviews, which
were begun yesterday morning and
are scheduled for today and Monday,
are to determine verbally the appli-
cant’s interests and ascertain his per-
sonality aspects for teaching.

is only one aspect in the procedure

ed Theodore Siedle, assistant to the

are: the health rating, which is ob-
tained from Dr, Auleene M. Jameson
and Dr. Clifford H. Carlson; the schol-
arship average; and the average grade
of work accomplished in the appli-
cant’s major ﬁeld.”

will interview those seeking admis-
sion, are: Dr. Charles E. Prall, Theo-
dore A. Siedle, Dr. George Gould, D.D.

“The Broken Record”

INCE TIME lI\[3[EMOl:I.lA.L. and perhaps even
S before that, Electioil Day editorials have
pointed out to the voters the fact that “this

one must be clean and above board.”

Going‘ back through the files of University pub-
lica.t.ions, or of other college publications, it is evi-
dcnt that editorial. writers, no matter what their
warp and woof. have stood united on common
ground when campus election days have come
around. The situation of “dirty politics" has been
approai:-liecl from ever); conceivable angle and the
consensus of all such editorial opinion may be
summed up brieﬂy, “Tliey were against it.”

This year everyone sincerely believes that there
will be no trips around the block with the ballot
ll0T{PS while the good lieutenants quietly “st11fl:"’ in
the deciding ta1lies——.l-’itt elections have come up
to a new standard. Nor will the ballot boxes be
halfi-tfull when the First ballot drops through the
slot at approximatelfr 9:31 o’clock this morning‘,
nor will the system of double and triple voting be
in vogue—students who were sufficiently disgusted
with all that have seen fit to push the change.

The fact remains, however, that we are. far re-
‘moved from conditions at election times which
could be termed “satis‘t'actor_v." No matter how
cleanly the work at the polls is done, spoils of the.
voting will still go to those organized groups who
have laid e.are.t.'ul plans and carry them out metic-
ulously. Possibly no criticism can be directed at
those who work so hard to achieve their ends in
elections. Possibly the candidates they support
are the best. men for the jobs, possibly not.

Certa.inl_v, these are not to blame that the weak-

 

iny mindb at rest

The Pitt News

ncss of their opponents makes the ﬁght seem un-
fair at times. The organized factions are no

, stumbling blocks to the unorganized or unatﬁliated

mass of student voters~—if those student voters
take the trouble to come out and vote!

The little pink and blue and yellow and green
cards have made their appearance this year as in
every other year. Students accept them, the fresh-
men with wonderment. the seniors with smiles.
Seine vote the way the cards read; some don ’t.

That, then, is no great. matter. The great mat-

Intercollegiate

So What?

Did the 20th century begin January 1. 1900, or January
1, 1901? A University of Texas professor battled :1 class
in Greek history with this question. Halt‘ the class voted
JaI1l18l'.V 1. 1900. While the other half wouldn't comment.

The learned pedagogue ﬁnally told the boys and girls.
"There’s no such thing as a zero year,” he said. “Did
you ever stop to think of the year 1 A. D.‘? Now think
about 100 A. D., and you’ll see only 99 years passed be-
tween January 1, 1 A. D. and January 1, 100 A. D."

Therefore. January 1, 101, is the date that znarked the
exact passing of the first century after Christ, and the
20th century began January 1, 1901.

Olson To Take 20 Men To Philadelphia For Dual Meet;
Peacock, Threadgill Head Strong Owl Outﬁt

Faced with the double handicap of conceding at least 20 points
to several “sure-ﬁre” Temple winners and at the same time grasping
for at least an equal number that should 1*igl1tf11ll_v belong to the

Pitt side of the leclger under the usual pre-meet ratings, Coach}

Olson ’s squad opens the outdoor campaign tomorrow on the Temple
stadium track in Philadelphia with just about an even chance for

victory.

This situation is not the habit in a:

Pitt-Temple meet, for in the past two
clashes Pitt topped the Owl two-ring
show much in the same manner that
the well-known P. T. Barnum’s big
tent covers the “greatest show in the
world.”

Temple has the individual stars of
the show in two world-beaters, Al
Threadgill and Eulace Peacock. The
latter can rightfully claim the title
of the “world’s fastest human” on the
basis of his decisive triumphs over
the Ohio State sensation, Jesse
Owens, and the South’s representa-
tive, Henry Neugass.

Only one man, Cornelius Johnston
of Ca.lifornia_ world’s record holder,
has hung up a better mark in the high
jump than Temple’s AlThreadgil1.
Both Peacock and Threadgill hit out
around the 25-foot mark in the broad
Jumping pit.

So you see, this ﬂying trapeze act
just might shoot through the “big
top” of the well-balanced Panther can-
vas tomorrow. To aid them, Hibsch-
man will offer plenty of competition
to shove Gene Taano’s javelin record
past the 198-foot mark, established in
the 1935 show.

Cohen is another Owl favored to
account for points in the weight
events. He consistently heaves the
shot 47 feet or more, some ﬁve feet
better than the best Panther effort to
date. Two strong distance men, Ro-
land Demott and ‘Walt Nachoney, will
offer Tost, Theriault, Leggin, and
Cook competition in the mile and two-
mile runs.

The durable pieces in the Panther
canvas depend on the Pitt middle-
distance runners. Art Thomas and
Harold Connelly shape up as the men
to watch in the quarter, and Connelly
and Groat should have a fairly easy
time of it in the half.

Art Thomas’ position in the 100 and
220 can hardly be termed hopeless,
for the IC4A indoor 50-meter champ
might just upset the Temple Peacock

lin the furlong event. Pete Bennett's
lack of experience in the high jump
will do him no good in the high jump
against the six-foot, six-inch leaps of
Threadgill.

The Panther party that departs to-
night for Philadelphia includes 20
trackmen, Coaches Olson and Potts,
and Manager Claus. This group will
arrive at Temple early in the morn-
ing and, following the meet in the
afternoon. will return by train to
Pittsburgh.

Along F0urFr0nts

Chuck full of activity, the Intramu-
ral slate is running at top speed right
now, with wrestling and ping pong
having just been completed, basket-
ball roaring into the ﬁnals, and mush-
I)all warming up for a late April in-
augural.

The long delayed Intramural wrest-
ling tournament was ﬁnally held a
,week ago Wednesday. A shortage of
gentries limited the title allotment to
only four. Medal winners were Rob-
ert Gibney in the 118-pound class, Ivan
Lauick, among the 135-pound boys,
Roger llsley in the 155-pound divi-
sion, and Jack Emery in the 165-pound
section.

Supremacy in Interfraternity table
tennis belongs to Delta Tau Delta.
The Delt quintet of Hurst, I-Ialler,
Gleason, I-lousel, and Pritchard defeat-
ed sigma Alpha Mu, 3-2, just before
the Easter
Greek champions.

Delayed probably more than any
other Intramural activity, the basket-
ball program hits the home stretch
this week with the ﬁnal play-offs. Fra-
ternity teams in the ﬁnals are the
winners of the Delt-PiKA game to-
gether with Kappa Sigma, Phi Kappa,
and Phi Delta Theta.
gineers and Metallurgists, ﬁrst and
second in the Engineer League, and
the Newman Club and O-G Sophties,
sharers of ﬁrst place in the independ-
ent league, are also in the playoffs.

Intramural mushball plans have been
announced and entry blanks are now
available at the Trees Gymnasium of-
ﬁce or the Dean of Men’s office. En-
tries from any organization will be ac-
cepted up to Friday, April 24. None
will be accepted after that date. Squad
limits have been set at 15 men.

Fraternity Women To Dance

At Panhellenic Ball Tonight

Carl Eddy’s Orchestra
To Furnish Music
In Urban Room

Rumors have it that Betty Kelley,
C37, social chairman of Panhellenic
Council and Frank Hess, a junior at
Carnegie Tech, will be leading the
grand march at the Panhellenic Ball
tonight in a Scotch military lock-step.
But it is doubtful whether Margaret
Chalmers, Ed36, president of the
Council, and Knighton Waite, her es-
cort for the ball, will follow in step.

The annual Council formal, sister
dance to the Interfraternity Ball, is
being held at the Urban Room of the
Vvilliam Penn Hotel.

Fraternity women and their escorts
will attend the affair, tickets for which
are priced at $3 a couple.

Carl Eddy’s Orchestra, which has
been engaged for this evening’s ‘ball,
is also slated to play for the Military
Ball. Eddy has played on local radio
stations and is a favorite with Pitts-
burgh dancers. _ .

Chaperons who will be enloying
themselves as well as keeping {ab
on the dancers from 9 to 1 o’clock in-
clude Mr. and Mrs. Theodore Bid-
dle, and Mr. and Mrs. Claude W. Wood“-
side. The guest list also includes ls
additional names.

Three—fourths of each women’s fra-
ternity membership is expectéd to be
present at the main social affair of the
Council.

Committee members who have as-
sisted Miss Kelley, C37. are Janet
Hanock, C38, Marion Messer, C37,.
Louise Kelly, Ed36, and Jean Law-

son, C37.
