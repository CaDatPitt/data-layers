By JEAN BARNES

Long ago (in the dark ages,
it is believed by reliable ex-
perts) a» writer, a piece of pa-
per and an editor got together,
and there came from the un-
lucky union a college story. Since
then there has been no escaping
the fate. Willy-nilly, like it or
not, we of the college strata are
ginny, light-hearted sacrilegious
young ones who elope at the drop
of a hat, and enroll only to get to
as many parties and cut as many
classes as possible. Mirabile
Dictu! What a sad fate, n’est-ce
pas?

However, sometime shortly after
next week, those of you to whom
we dedicate this issue will turn a

College, you will murmur bitterly
to one in particular, is certainly a
heck of a lot different!

Froth Out . . .

The intent of this column, let,

us hasten to tell you, is not to dis-
courage but to disabuse. College
is not the frothy existence you
might have hoped; we here in
Pitt consider it usual rather than
quixotic to go to classes. No, the
intent of the column is to tell you
what We do for recreation here at
Pitt, since elopements and good
Scotch cost so much money.

For one thing, we like dancing,
we do a lot of it, we have good
orchestras for as many dances as
we can afford here at school, and
we frown only on the lower forms
of the mooch and half—Ne1sons.
We also worship Benny Goodman,
know something about
music, go to Greensburg regular-
ly for the bands they import there,
and boo heartily long-underwear
gangs.

Along with all this, though, we
also consider it cricket to know
that Beethoven and Ravel had
something on the ball; consequent-

ly you won’t be a sissy if you save

pennies to go to some of the Syria

In

Freslnnan \Veek, the seventh
annual Freshman Camp Con-

end at Camp Kon-O-Kwee,
near Zelienople. '

Camp activities this year are
under the direction of Al Kairys,
BA39, who also represents the
Owl staff and Pitt Rifles. Kali"-
ys and his committee have
arranged a program ranging from
formal speeches by deans and fac-
ulty members to a renowned Sun-
day chicken dinner, as prepared
by the camp’s Chinese chef.

Musical entertainment will be
provided by a section of the Uni-
versity band, under the direction
of Theodore Finney, director of
instrumental music; by the Uni-
versity Quartet; and by as many
individual freshmen as show up
with instruments,

Athletics will play a prominent
part, with mushball, tennis, swim-
ming, and, if the condition of
Conoquenessing Creek warrants,
boating. Tournaments between
the various schools will feature
outdoor activities.

Serious advice on activities, fra-
ternities, and everything else about
which freshmen Worry, will be
‘given by the faculty and student

fact, if you don’t go you shouldn’t ' leaders at the various “bu1l ses-

be bright enough to get in Pitt.

Students Rate . . .

For the 1937-38 concerts, May
Beegle offers such stars as Rosa
Ponselle, Lily Pons, Artur Schna-
bel, Fritz
Choir Boys, the Salzburg Opera
Guild, and the Jooss European
Ballet. Only get your seats early:
we have student rates here, and
you’l.' have to get in and ﬁght.
While you’re asking about these
concerts, you might ask for the
symphony program for this year
—-and grab one for me, too, will
you?

I take it for granted that you
know we follow the Nixon’s book-
ings with something not far from
bated breath. At most of these
plays—which number this year
“Victoria Regina” starring Helen
Hayes; “Star Wagon” with Burgess
Meredith, “Richard III” with
Maurice Evans; and such box-of-

. ﬁ_ce farces as “You Can’t Take It

’\with iYou,” “Brother Rat,” and

 

“Having a Wonderful Time,” as
‘well as the always excellent Thea-
tre Guild contributions——I say, at
most of these plays you could
swing on a chandelier and peg
peanuts any place in the house,
only to hit fellow students. Most
of us crane from the second bal-
cony, though; we remember the
depression, too.

Add Free Shows . . .

So far our suggestions have
been concerned with money and
plenty of it. Let me bring out
now that if you don’t play golf
every Sunday, you might try the
free organ recitals at Carnegie
Music Hall; or during the season,
visit the now-elaborate and ex-
traordinarily beautiful ﬂower
show, or roller-skate with the
crowd on any smooth street. And
absolutely no one misses the In-
ternational! That’s the truth, too.

‘ct even if you have a sprained
ankle.

Before wé_fo‘r‘g'et-, reading is not
yet a buried art at this or any
other college. While exact statis-
tics are lasking on the ,nureeer bf
college students who round time
for “Gone With thé Wind,” it
might -be a good lfiiea to equip
yourself with a l€‘§t of best-sellers
and ﬁnd out hfow to use our own
and Carnegie libraries.

Even if you don’t feel the siren
song of the unﬁnished history pa-
per in your ear, either library is
a nice place to read and relax . . .
and easier on the digestion than
a cook at the drugstore.

Before Coca-Cola sues us for

libel, however, and before you"re=
completely overwhelmed with ad-‘

vice, and before sententiousness

and a sort of reluctant tenderness:
creeps over us, let us say ‘that.
 these places are Ofﬁcampus 'rn'usts.'
Pick your own; ‘ﬁnd your"ow‘n;f

or laugh at us for old fogies. But,

Kairys.

Freshmen who can provide

Kairys or with Mr. Mendenhall,

Curricula
Additions

Announced
New Courses Offered

In Engineering,

Nursing

New courses in nursing and en-
gineering head the additions to
this year’s curriculum.

In cooperation with the Magee
Hospital School of Nursing, the

”"S’ch“oOl’ of ‘Educatioil ‘war offer a

special course for graduate nurses,

to enable those without college de-
grees to win them. The course

bined with classroom instruction.
Three college years and one sum-
mer session will be required.

The increasing demand for nur-
ses with academic degrees as su-
pervisors and instructors has made
possible the new course.

DEGREE GIVEN

Another nursing course, a ﬁve-
year program, which will lead to
the graduate nurse certificate and
to a bachelor of science degree,
has been added to the curriculum
of the College, Dean Stanton C.
C_raw_fo1:'d announces. Half the
work of this latter course will be
given in conjunction with the
rapidly-growing University Medi-
cal Center units, with the other
half consisting of academic
courses.

In the School of Engineering, a
six-year evening course leading to
a degree of bachelor of science in

general engineering has been es-
tablished. The course is designed
to help men employed in business
or industry for whom the regular
engineering courses are unsuited.
The Evening Division will offer
new courses in astronomy, fine
arts, music appreciation, and his-
tory, according to J . Lloyd Ma-

hony, director.

Chancaellor
Addresses

...Assem§  ly 

University Head,

Emphasizes

Student Attitutle

Stressing the ihiportance of
the student’s atti  de as a vital
factor in buildin", a successful
school life, Dr. ohn G. Bow-
man, chaiicellor “ the Univer-
sity, welcomed thf class of 1941
at the annuagl reshman As-
seinbly, held las}, Monday at
Memorial Hall. 

Three things weite brought out
by the Chancellor las making the
diﬁerence between; success or
failure at the Unfvei*sity. First,
Dr. Bowman emphasized the op-
portunities offered here for per-
sonality changes, in his opinion
the true purpose of a college. “The
very building cries out the oppor-
tunity,” he said. O

MANNERS IRTIPORTANT

The manners shqyvn by the stu-
dent are a good indicator of his
personality and character, accord-
ing to the Chanigellor. Trivial.
courtesies are excellent manifesta-
tions of the exceflence attained
by the student, notin scholarship,
but in the even more important
job of moulding him for the fu-
ture, he added. .
The third and most important
factor, stated Dr. Bowman, is the
~l student’s attitude toward his stud-
,ies, toward his fellows, and to-
f ward himself. University life
 would be successful for a student
] if once during his four years there
came upon him a great “moment
gof inspiration,” when his whole
§life’s work and attitude were
 clear.

5 EDUCATION’S':PURPOSE

 

1 ‘“‘If ~ieuucati‘aa--~-ca‘&e%»uo —--one great —

3 thing,” he said, “it can make these
gmoments come closer together.
:Greatness will come with the in-
icreasing frequency of these in-
spirational periods, which may
last one minute, or 15, or 20.” _
Distinction can also be motivat-
ed by the ability to reduce the
material of life to an essence, or
Vice versa. In illustrating this
statement, Dr.
tioned Stephen Foster’s “Old Ken-
tucky Home,” in which he boiled
down his love of home to the es-
sence of a song, which has in-
spired so many of its hearers.‘

Corley Reveals
Housing Need

Wanted!‘ At least 50 more
houses for the University Hous-
ing bureau. Please see Robert R.
Corley at once.

It seems that the influx of out-
of—town students to the Univer-
sity‘-is so great that, as yet, ac-
commodations are not up to the
demand. Mr. Corley, assistant to
the dean of men and in charge
of the Housing Bureau, has re-
ported that names have been sub-
mitted from only 52 homes fo
approval. {

All the houses are within walki-
ing distance of the University and
are approved by the University
Housing Bureau, aided by students
who serve as inspectors. _

So, if you are looking for rooms,
just apply at the University Hous-
ing Bureau and Mr. ‘Corley will
take care of you.

CA Dances,

Loan Plans
Announced

College Association plans for a
series of four dances during the
current school year and continu-
ance of the Student Loan Fund
were announced to freshmen stu-
dents in the College at an assem-
bly Monday by Theodore Whit-
aker, C38, president of the organ-
ization.

The CA social program, as an-
nounced by Whitaker, will con-
sist of four varied dances. First
of these will be the annual “How-
dy I-lop,” scheduled for the Uni-
versity Club, next Wcdensday aft-
ernoon from 2:30 to 5:39 o’clock.
The dance is planned to give
freshmen an opportunity to ac-
quaint themselves better with both
their classmates and upperclass-
men. Admission will be 25 cents.

Next event on the program will
be the “Kick—Off” dance Thursday
evening, October 1, at the Grotto
on the North Side. Tickets for

. this dance will sell at one dollar

per couple.  __ . 
Two more dances will round out

the year’s social program . . . a
Thanksgiving formal and one
second-semester dance. This new

policy of only one second-semester
dance, Whitaker explained, is de-
signed to relieve the University’s
crowded social calendar at that
time of the year.

Whitaker also explained the
workings of the Student Loan
Fund. The fund, he said, makes
loans available -to all University
students. Its present assets, which
theﬁdance proceeds will swell, are
$781.32.

University Student Crashes 
M agicians’ Brotherhood   «

Tuition worries of James Rea-
gan, C40, were solved by the mail-
man!

A letter making him a full-
fledged member of the Interna-
tional Brotherhood of Magicians
brought the solution to the Uni-
versity sophomore’s ﬁnancial wor-
ries.

“I am a magician,” announced
Reagan to the cashier, who ex-
tended her hand for the money.
Bringing out a ten—dollar bill,
Reagan waved his hand, and $150
plummeted to the ground. With
the union approving, Reagan was
able to allow his magicians’ art
to go to work on his tuition.

“However, that ‘is a simple
trick,” claims Reagan. “My real-

trick—the only one in the United‘
States. It is the same bar" I’ used’-
this summer at the El Rancho-
night club, Chester, Pa. Specta-
tors examine the bar, find‘ it emp-
ty. Then I pour them any‘ 
they order. I believe‘ the night’
club management found: 1”: saved:
them liquor bills.” '

Reagan, 19 years old, claims to
be the youngest local member of
the Magicians brotherhood, of
which Gus Kant is the’ district
president. This year’ Reagan ex-
pects to ﬁll local engagements
with his magicians" tricks, while
going to school. “I need‘ only a
pretty girl and my act is com-
plete,” he says.

Benediction

ODAY freshmen enter the fi-

nal stages of a week of regis-
examinations, ._
and a crowded pre-session orien-

tration, entrance
tation program which will prob-
ably give them some vague idea
of campus personalities and or-
ganizations.

Customarily the first issue of

The Pitt News welcomes them
with simulating ideologies, Hail to
Pitt cheers, and general innocuous
advice. Welcome to our Univer-
sity . . students of all creeds,
political and social ideals . . . a
wonderful Democracy . . intel-
lectual atmosphere . . activities
for all-around development .
cultivate interesting new friend-
ships . . . and if you’re going to
enter activities, think of specializ-
ing . . . and several other things.

But instead of giving the Class
of ’4l this welcoming, we should
like to offer them the University
just as it is, without softening the
lines which may eventually stand
in relief for them.

It is not all that it is sometimes
painted. There are many men
who have tried to bring the Uni-
versity closer to the educational
ideals that have been set for it,

but there are some who do not;

seriously care. And it is these who
usually ballyhoo the wonderful
conditions, etc.

If you take their word for gos-
pel, they will make you the typi-
cal graduate. They’ll see that
you’re registered in the “proper”
courses, will help you get into
the right circles, will give you
boom talk on Pitt spirit, and let
you stagnate for four rather pleas-
ant years. Above all, sometime
you may be appointed chairman
of a dance or elected to digniﬁed
honor societies. And you will
probably never have any need to
think.

But this does not have to be
the case. There are opportuni-
ties for a truly liberal and broad-
ening education if you’ll look for
them.

If you pick your courses wisely
and choose your activities care-

Freshman Readingq
Required and Otherwise

 

This is a literary column as fu-
ture issues of the Pitt News, I
hope, will prove. For
merit, however, our

the ino-
concern is

with that appealing term, “required I

reading,” and its application to
freshmen. It is commonly agreed
that the freshman should get a
certain amount of reading done:
but as to what that reading should
comprise, there is not nearly so
much harmony.

There is something about re-
«quired reading lists that makes the
best of us shudder, and I think,
rightly so. Some are so long and
so all—inclusive as to defeat any
purpose for which they might be
“required.” Others, made up by
someone who credits the average
reader with a borderline IQ, are
too simple to be of any interest
whatever.

Another shortcoming of the re-
quired reading list is the illusion
that by reading a certain group of
books one will ﬁnd the Answer to
all things, and therefore, will be-
come “educated.”

An “education,” unfortunately,
is not so easily achieved; in fact,
most universities lately have

dropped the guarantee of an edu-
cation with each diploma. The
freshman will do well to forget
the answer for a while until he
learns what a few of the questions
are.

For these reasons we should
hesitate to prescribe any particular
twenty or thirty books for fresh-
man consumption. Far more
helpful than following a deﬁnite
list of books is ﬁnding the kind of
books that are most important to
you at this time.

On this point we suggest that
you let your reading. follow your
basic courses. If you’re in the
College, such reading will give

Thirty-one thousand visitors

Visitors included people from

Student guides, Roderick Irons,

swered questions ranging from,
“How High is the Cathedral?” to
“What is this building?” “The

Caiferty, “was the visitor who

* Panther Football Team
Prepares For Big Season

fr

Ten-Game Slate °

Faces . Veteran
Pitt Outfit

By Leonard Levlson

Once more having to forsake *
the wilds of Windber as a pre-
season conditioning locale, the
Panthers have been sharpemng
their snarl in the comparative
quiet of an uninhabited campus
since Labor Day when the two-a-
day drills began.

Camping in the swanky P. A. A.,
which is not another government
project but the accepted abbrevia-
tion for the Pittsburgh Athletic
Association on Fifth Avenue, the
Pitt football ‘team has been hiking
up to Trees Field for practices
every morning and afternoon.
The training table has been set
up- in the University "Cafeteria.

Close to 60 gridmen have been
working into the condition that
Dr. John B. Sutherland, chief of
football staff, knows will be neces-
sary to stiff-arm through the
strong schedule that has been
cooked up for this year.

It isn’t hard to 'understand why
Pitt will have a very, very tough
time of it. They are in the P0-
sition of national champions, and
what is worse from a winning
point of view, is the fact that
they’re picked to hold that place
when Thanksgiving rolls around
again.

PITT ON THE SPOT

There are ten teams on the
Panther schedule. This means
that there will be ten teams whose
Season’s objective is to beat Pitt.
Added to that is the uncomfort-
able position of favorite in most
of these ten games that has been
handed to the Sutherlands. This,
of course, is all pre-season rat-
ings, subject to immediate change
as soon as and if Pitt is beaten.

Ohio Wesleyan in an encore en-
gagement will be opponent num-
ber I. This game will be played
at the Stadium on September 25
and looms as one of those old
fashioned score raisers with the
Panthers adding the points.

October 2, Pitt will beat it to
the mountains for a skirmish with
those West Virginia Mountaineers.

column of last year, will take its
place “Under a Bushel” for the
first issue ‘next Wednesday. Bern-
