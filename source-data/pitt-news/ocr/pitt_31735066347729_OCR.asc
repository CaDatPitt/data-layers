The American Sociological
Association (ASA) ‘adopted a report
Saturday that found no substantia-
tion for assistant sociology pro-
fessor Paul Nyden’s charges that
the decision not to renew his
contract was due to political rather
than academic reasons.

The report, passed at a meeting
of the ASA Council, was adopted in
lieu of a general business meeting
resolution introduced last Septem-
ber that would have resulted in
ASA support for Nyden.

The Committee on Freedom of
Research and Teaching report on
the Nyden case is the result of an.
investigation requested by both

Nyden and Pitt’s department of —

sociology.

“I ﬁnd it absolutely incredible
that the report ﬁnds the ﬁring is
not political," Nyden said yester-
day. The ﬁndings will not affect his
casewithin the University, hesaid,
because it is an external review.

Acting sociology chairman Vijai
Singh said “The report vindicates
the department. It makes us feel
that our decision not to reappoint
Nyden was reasonable."

In February, 1976, Pitt’s socio-
logy department decided not to
renew Nyden’s contract after his
three-year appointment ends - this
April. The decision not to renew
Nyden’s contract was based pri-
m rily on a review that determined
his scholarly work was “inade-
quate."

Nyden has charged he was not
he is a
Marxist.

The ASA report, which includes
a chronological sequence of events
in the Nyden case, states “we find
no evidence of a calculation by the
tenured faculty to conceal an

ulterior agenda of procedures and .

reasons for ‘getting rid‘ of

Nyden." It also found no
substantial evidence to support a
Nyden charge that the content of
his activism played _a role in the
deicsion not to renew his contract.

The report also expresses agree-
ment with the Faculty of Arts and
Sciences Tenure and Promotion
Hearing Board ﬁnding there were

sufﬁcient grounds to legitimately
question the quality of Nyden’s
scholarship, as a sociologist.

“Our reading of the second,
review report and our investigation
of the process by which the
steering committee reached its
decision does not reveal that

iASAReIeases Nyden Report Pitt Townhouse Proiecl

improprieties occurred,” the report E n  U n   n 7 n g  

states.

Members of the committee
intentionally avoided reading Ny-
den’s work, according to the
report, in order not to “second
guess” the sociology departments’
decision on Nyden’s scholarship.
“This committee and the ASA
cannot intrude into the substantive
evaluation,” it states. ‘

Nyden said yesterday the mem-
bers of the committee should have
read his work. “If they had looked
at my scholarly work, they could

have .evaluated_ the situation

A possible zoning law violation
may prevent Pitt’s proposed
construction of 20 four-person
townhouses on the corner of Bates
and Oakland Streets.

The zoning law in question limits
the number of unrelated people
living in a single family unit to
three.

Because the townhouses would
house four unrelated people, the»
University has applied for a
“conditional use” of institutional
housing, which would bypass the
three person limit, Hunt Martin,
director of facilities planning for the
University, explained.

Various Oakland citizens’ groups
opposing the construction of the
townhouses, including Oakland
Directions, Inc. (ODI), ‘Peoples
Oakland and the South Oakland
Citizens’ Council (SOCC) voiced
their objections at a public hearing
held before the Pittsburgh Planning
Commission yesterday.

The citizens’ groups said their
main objection to the construction of
the townhouses was the reduction of
parking facilities.

“Pitt wants to build on what is
now a commercial parking lot. The
parking problems in Oakland are’
phenomenal and anyone who has

searched for a parking place knows .

the parking problem in Oakland is
phenomenal,” one SOCC represen-
tative said. a

“The townhouse project does not
include enough parking spaces for
the number of cars that will be
attached to the persons living
there,” the SOCC representative
said.

“A number of parking spaces, in
keeping with the city’s require-
ments for this type of housing, will

be constructed at the location,”

Martin said.

“The proposed townhouses will
have adequate parking to accom-
modate their residents,” William
Kaliden, vice chancellor for public
affairs said. “The townhouses also
will enable 80 additional students to
live adjacent to campus, eliminating
the need for 80 students to live at a
distance and drive into Oakland.

‘‘In September, when we open
the Forbes, Quadrangle, we also
will contribute 480 more parking
spacesf’

recently by an expedition led by Dr.
William Cassidy of Pitt’s depart-

The 898-pound chunk_of shiny
brown rock from space was one of 11
meteorites found between Dec. 10,
1976, and Jan. 20, 1977. It was
found in 33 pieces scattered on top

NextYear's Homecoming C-MU Crime Rate Plummets

By JOYCE BEVC

The 1977 homecoming commit-
tee budget may be triple the amount
of last years’ budget, according to
homecoming committee chairman
Marsha Blythe.

The committee requested $22,
733 from the Student Government
allocations committee. Blythe said

.$10,000 is needed to finance an
outdoor concert featuring four or
ﬁve bands.

“Our budget is the highest ever,
but only because we are incorporat-
ing so many activities and because
prices have gone up,” she said.

Pitt is plagued by a higher
crime rate than its neighbor
Carnegie-Mellon University (CMU)
because Oakland is a high crime
area, according to Campus Police
Lieutenant Sam Conte.

Both universities reported a
decrease in campus crime for the
past year with Pitt registering a 6.9
percent drop. CMU’s crime rate
fell 20 percent, according to CMU
security director Michael Corletti.

“There are. many factors that
explain CMU’s lower crime rate.
but the main reason is that CMU is
situated in a lower crime area."

CMU, Conte said, is similar to a
suburban setting with a very
compact campus while Pitt covers
more urban territory.

Although CMU's crime rate did
decline last year, Conte said Pitt’s
police force, which numbers about
100,‘is‘better staffed and combats
crime more aggressively than
CMU’s security force.

According to Conte, Pitt has
more security officers on a single
shift than comprise CMU’s total
force. “This is a higher crime area
and Pitt is a big University, so we
have to cover more territory,” he
said.

Corletti refused to divulge the
number of officers presently on '

Carnegie-Mellon’s squad. He said,
however, that it has done an
outstanding job preventing crime
on the campus. '

“The individual\ofﬁcers deserve
the credit along with our aggres-
sive patrol policy,” Corletti said.

He also said that city police in

the area have been cooperative in
combatting crime in the Squirrel
Hill and Shadyside areas of the
CMU campus.

The main campus crime at Pitt is
theft, according to Conte. and
accounts for up‘ to 40 percent of the
crimes reported by students.

“It’s a simple fact of life that
students can leave their dorms for
just a minute and find someone has
ripped off their stereo or television
set," Conte said.

Corletti said it was difficult to
pinpoint the major source of crime
on his campus.

The most effective crime ﬁghting
weapon, according to Conte, is an
aggressive patrolling policy and
tighter security of the force coupled

with growing student awareness of

burglaries.

better," he said.

Although the report is generally
favorable to the sociology depart-
ment’s decision on the Nyden case,
it found the department remiss in
providing speciﬁc standards and
criteria to be used in a reappoint-
ment evaluation, although it found
both parties “inattentive."

“We believe that general stan-
dards leave considerable room for
misunderstanding, and where de-
tails are left to informal processes,
there are dangers of miscommuni-
cation."

Nyden's charges of outside
interference by the Chancellor or
members of the University’s Board
of Trustees because of dislike for
Nyden’s ideology and activities
were also found to be unsubstan-
tiated.

The committee also censured
past ASA President Alfred Mc-
Clung Lee for his outspoken
support of Nyden at Pitt in October.
“As president of the ASA, it was
incumbent upon him, as upon all
members of the committee, to
retain a public stance of neutrality
during the, investigation.”

,is a measure of the importance of

the Yamato Mountain discovery.”

These discoveries indicate the
Antarctic continent is an area
that lends itself more readily to the
collection of meteorites than other
parts of "the world.

Cassidy said the E expedition
followed an accidental 1969 discov-
ery of a high concentration of
meteorites by a Japanese team of

, glaciologists in a nearby mountain

range. Since then, several
Japanese expeditions have discov-
ered fragments from as many as 330
individual meteorites.

Japanese explorer Keizo Yanai of
the Japanese National Institute of
Polar Research in Tokyo unexpect-
edly joined the expedition when
Cassidy and his colleague, Edward
Olsen of the Field Museum of
Natural History in Chicago, landed
in the Antarctica. .

Cassidy explained there is an
international treatise that prevents
land claims and allows any nation to
enter Antarctica for the purpose of
scientific exploration. Yanai was
indirectly informed of Cassidy’s and
Olsen’s adventure and decided to
join them.

Under a prior agreement, half of
the meteorites have been sent to
Japan while the other half is en
route to the United States.

U.S. - CASTRO APPROACH
NORMALIZATION OF
RELATIONS

WASHINGTON (AP)—~Until
Cuba moved troops into Angola, the
United States and Castro govern-
ment representatives met for about
a year in secret on establishing
normal relations.

At the high-level meetings, at
airports and in a New York hotel,
“we catalogued the range of issues
outstanding between the United
States and Cuba,”
Rogers, a principal American
participant, said.

Except for one brief session, the
talks ended with Cuba’s military
intervention in September 1975, in
the Angolan Civil War.

However, knowledgeable sources
here said Cuba’s support for a
Marxist faction was only one of
several possible reasons for the
dialogue coming to an end.

Others, the sources said. includ-
ed apparent differences within the
government in Havana on how far to
go toward resuming relations with
Washington. Also, there was the
growing prospect that a Democratic
administration would come to
power here and be more favorably
disposed toward a renewal of ties.

Rogers, then assistant secretary
of state for Latin American affairs,
said in an interview that “what we
were doing was explaining, as

SODOMY LAW REPEAL
WITHOUT SI:.'NATIi.‘ SUPPORT

HARRISBURG (AP)—State
senators had personal or political
reasons in mind when they
withdrew their support from a bill
to repeal the state's sodomy laws, a
deputy attorney general said.

Barry Kohn, deputy in charge of
the state’s Community Advocate
Unit, denied earlier statements by
senators and Atty. Gen. Robert
Kane that he had misled law-
makers into signing the bill.

Kohn said he talked with 25
senators and explained the bill
would remove sections of the law
barring sodomy between consent-
ing adults and would increase the
statue of limitations on rape.

“Pitt is claiming when the Forbes Q

Quadrangle Building is open it will

‘supply 480 parking spaces thus

replacing 200 which would be lost

Peoples Oakland said.

“This is a misrepresentation of

the facts because the spaces under 

the Quad building will be for staff
and faculty who now park in the
Syria Mosque lots and other lots in
that part of campus. ,

“The people displaced from the
Oakland-Bates lot are students and
health center employes who will not
be allowed to park under the Quad
building.” '

Pitt of being an irresponsible
landlord.

“Pitt has a poor record of
maintaining housing it currently
owns or has owned in Oakland,”
ODI President James E. Ray said.
“Renovation comes only after

and tenants.”

  Solution Without Union

The Union of Graduate Employes (UGE) is starting a push for
administrative recognition of their organization as the collective
bargaining agent for graduate student employes, following the
mandate they received from the workers in last week’s mock
election. Ballot results indicate there is something wrong with the
way the administration is treating its graduate workers, but this is
no reason for these professionals to form a union.

As stated previously, graduate students must be students first,
then workers. Any union formed would de-emphasize the learning
role that is also part of being a TA or TF.

-A union would upset the balance of power between graduate
workers, faculty and students, drowning out what little power the
undergraduates have. And through probable salary and benefit
increases, ‘it would raise tuition. UGE promises to insure
realignment of University budget priorities in order to release funds
for salary increases, but Pitt has done nothing like this in the past
to set a precedent that guarantees this action now or at any time in
the future.

Though this vote indicates that graduate worker complaints are
numerous, the University has no legal obligation to recognize a
union that feels it can solve the problems. However, the
administration must start looking into what it can do to improve
the lot of the graduate workers. A commission or disappearing
task force must be formed to find out what the University can do;
and obviously the report cannot be “no problem exists.”

It is time for Pitt to stop hiding behind the legal defense of no
responsibility and start sincere efforts toward improvement of
working conditions for its graduate student employes.

Calendar Without Choice

Pitt’s 1977-78 academic calendar is a chain with quite a few weak
final draft
of the schedule. ‘ 1

This third draft appeared, containing many revisions. There was
an extra week added to Christmas vacation and religious holidays
were omitted. And it reached the Student Government Board one
day before final recommendations were due.

Students don’t expect the power to dictate the details of their
academic schedule. But they expect the administration to allow
their leaders the chance to make constructive criticism before final
approval prevents any change for the better.

There are a few questions where answers are too late for action.
Pitt stands to save $7,000 per day by keeping these buildings closed
an extra week in January. How much extra money will be spent
maintaining and air conditioning these structures an extra week in
the summer? '

. Why is the reading period so short? Students have only two extra
days to prepare for their final exams. lt’s too late to change that

.I'lOW.

Will theextended spring session hurt job opportunities for the
Pitt student? Will all the good summer jobs be gone by the last
spring session final in late June, 1978? The University claims that it
won’t, but they don’t elaborate on the answer.

Does the elimination ‘of religious holidays from the calendar
move Pitt one step closer towards being an impersonal teaching
machine? It was easy to eliminate all holidays instead of listing as
many as possible. But it is unfair to leave observance up to the
discretion of faculty and students. What is needed here is some sort
of re-affirmation of Pitt policy that allows students‘ and staff
holidays like Good Friday or Yom Kippur without any penalty.

High Pay—Qua|ity Legislators  i

By GARY GOVERT

It was late August of last year and
the southeast Tennessee sun was
bright on. the dashboard, brushing
the dust with gold. The faint hint of
dry coolness in the air said that
summer was about to fall into
football ‘season; through the open

_ windows of the car, my wife and I‘
could see the small fields, of

half-harvested tobacco and the
naked-from-the-waist-up men who
chopped it and stacked it in long,
straight rows.

Guided by an oil company map
and celebrating our escape from the
trappings of modern civilization, we
made the unmarked, unnoticeable
transition to North Carolina on a
gray-rock gravel road. The path
serpentined down the side of a
mountain, hemmed in by a green
tangle of vines and trees growing
right up to the gravel’s edge.
Invisible birds chorused behind the
shadows of crowding pines and
hardwoods. A small stream
alternately ran beside the road or
veered off on a short-cut down the
mountain. The air tasted like brook
water.

But as I eased the car down and
down into the narrow valley that
once or twice flashed like a snapshot
through a gap in the trees, the other
side of Appalachia gradually
appeared. Sagging wooden shacks,
seemingly melting into the humus,
began to dot the roadside. Most
were brown with weathered boards
and patched black with sheets of tar
paper. Some had rusted, corrugat-
ed roofs. Small ﬁelds of incredibly
tall corn grew up around the houses,

Comp Sci TA letter

and coal-dust colored pickups rotted
in the front yards. We saw no one,
but it seemed the shaded windows
darkened as we passed.

A week later we were back in
Pittsburgh. Downtown, the Renais-
sance-born temples to technology
were bathed in Golden Triangle
sun; in Oakland, the Cathedral of
Learning stretched. skyward, its
elevators lifting the minds of men
toward heaven. A leaping fountain
danced and sparkled over the
conﬂuence of three great rivers.of
commerce. The mills were turning
out the good life, 24 hours a day.

Then, in January, the wrath of
winter was full upon us. It was too
cold for the sun, and the temples
and cathedrals closed down reluc-
tantly. The fountain hadn‘t danced
in months. The mills were silent
and black along the silver frozen
rivers. -.

Before the worst of the cold, I
attended, along with about 100
other people, a conference address-
ing the problems of the city. In the
keynote speech we heard a black
banker explain how unemployment
and absentee landlords have locked
poor people into a cycle of
powerlessness-how the dollar
turns over 17 times in Squirrel Hill
and less than twice on the other Hill.
He told how inadequategand often
antagonistic police “protection”
makes his position as a legitimate
businessman on Herron Avenue
almost untenable.

Now, as the spring sun pulls the
crocuses from the ground along
suburban sidewalks, the empty,
gutted, red buildings on the Hill

continue to sit brooding in silent
testimony.

And now, in the white halls of

government along the Susquehanna
and Potomac Rivers, Pennsylvania
legislators and members of the U.S.
Congress are laboring for justice in
the land. Free from ﬁnancial
worries as a result of recent pay
raises, both groups of lawmakers
are grappling with the problems of
unemployment, inequality and
ignorance.

Little was said by either
legislature about the pay raises, but
it was generally agreed among the
nodding heads of state that the
raises were necessary if quality
people were to be attracted to
serving the American public.
Substantial monetary incentives
were vital if we wished to avoid
government of the people, for the
people, and by the wealthy.

Perhaps the pay raises-since
more money means fewer con-
s_traints—will allow senators and
representatives to maintain closer
touch with their constituencies.

Most signiﬁcant of all, tied to the
raises in the U.S. Congress is a new
code of ethics. In return for the
increases in pay, the country's
political graybeards are drafting
new standards that will transform
that august body into a moral
example for the nation.

And in Pittsburgh’s Hill District
and in Appalachia, people must be
wondering if our politicos have
found a way to thread a camel
through a needle’s eye.

Why Couldn’t I Vote?

The March 25th issue of the Pitt
News stated that “Pitt graduate
employes voted overwhelmingly in
favor of unionization...” This was
not a mock election, it was a
mockery of democracy. I make this
statement because, as an eligible
voter, I was not allowed to vote.

Late on the afternoon of March
24th, I went to the polling place in
the student union, presented my
student ID and identified myself as
ateaching fellow in the department
of computer science (CS). The
election workers stated that they
had no list of CS graduate employes
and thus could not conﬁrm the fact
that I was indeed a graduate
employe and therefore I could not
vote. There was an altemative-if I
could produce my letter of
appointment I would then be
allowed to vote. Unfortunately, my
letter of appointment“ ‘is not

_er9p‘9xe.s-°ae»bs .f°u!1<1;. . .

something I carry with me at all
times. Furthermore it was
impossible for me to fetch a copy of
it before the polls closed, so 1 could
not use the ‘ ‘alternative’ ’ in order to
exercise my right to vote.

Why was I not allowed to vote? In
trying to answer that question two
possible answers come to mind,
neither of which reflect well upon
the election nor the people that
staged it.

Answer 1: A list of Computer
Science TA's and TF ‘s could not be
found. I ﬁnd this impossible to
believe. There is a list of all
graduate employes posted in our
department. Our names are in the
Faculty & Staff directory. Judging
by the amount of mail I receive from
the Union of Graduate Employes
(UGE) I suspect there are other
places that a list of CS graduate

r£..l

If nobody could decipher this
information why wasn’t our depart-
mental graduate student organiza-
tion contacted?

Answer 2; Someone did not want
the CSTA's and ‘TF 5 to vote.Several
weeks before the election, a UGE
representative asked to speak to our
graduate student organization.

After recalling a similar visit from‘

the union last year. our organization
voted not to invite the UGE
representative to any of our
meetings.

I. find this to be an incredible
coincidence. Were the people in
favor of graduate employe unioniza-
tion afraid of the votes the graduate
employes in Computer Science (and
possibly elsewhere) might cast?

Letters To The Editor

Loo‘ per Victim’
Presents Side

~r

If Not All, Then
Let Off None

The Black Action Society is under
the impression that the student
code of conduct does not apply to its
members. In its letter to the Pitt
News (March 27) BAS states that
the Campus Judicial Board does not
have the right to remove the BAS
president from ofﬁce. According to
the student code of conduct, a
student placed on disciplinary
probation may not participate in any
extracurricular activities and may
not hold any ofﬁce within the
University.

Kevin Cooper was placed on
disciplinary probation as the result
of an unprovoked asssault on three
Pitt students. Following this attack,
the three students were hospital-
ized. The decision to place Cooper
on probation was made by a judicial

board consisting of three black-

students and two white students
and was approved by Vice
Chancellor for Student Affairs Dr.
Alfred Moye.

In addition to placing Cooper on
probation, the board also ordered
him to pay restitution to the victims
for their hospital bills. This was to
be paid no later than February 18. It

has not been paid yet.

Instead of condemning the Office
of Student Affairs, BAS should be
grateful to the judicial coordinator,
Mr. Alden Bowen, and the Judicial
Board for their efforts to allow
Kevin Cooper to remain a student at
the University. Throughout the
pre-trial period, which lasted an
unprecedented two months, Mr.
Bowden catered to every whim of
Kevin Cooper, granting continu-
ances for the weakest reasons and
then not notifying the complaints of
the changes. The trial date was
changed on one occasion because a
“key defense witness” would not
be able to attend. This was a
witness who later testiﬁed that he
saw nothing. ’

In addition to the favoritism
shown by Mr. Bowen, the Judicial
Board also showed favoritism
toward Kevin Cooper. Five
eyewitnesses testiﬁed that Kevin
Cooper struck the three complain-
ants with a tire iron and hospital
reports detailing the injuries of the
victims, were entered as evidence.
The defense witnesses did not
contradict the prosecution’s pre-
sentation. The only contradiction
was offered by Kevin Cooper, who
stated he struck the victims not with
a tire iron but with his ﬁsts.

The board found Cooper guilty of
the assault, but in a controversial
3-2 decision they found there was
not sufficient evidence presented to
prove that Cooper used a weapon.
As a result of this decision, one of
the dissenting members submitted
his resignation and petitioned for
the removal from Judicial Board of
the three black members of the trial
board. Reasons given were racial
prejudice and failure to reach a
verdict that matched the evidence.

I have to question the motives of
BAS for accusing the Office of
Student Affairs of harassment. Had
it not been for the assistance of Mr.
Bowen and the Judicial Board,
Kevin Cooper would probably not
be a student right now, let alone
BAS president.

But, how will I, when instead of

I believe that I have valid reason

What makes their beliefs more

I'm not suggesting that we cancel

all religious holidays in the future,
it’s the only fair way.

New Elitists-
Alienated Men

Iknow one of the new elitists. He
is the alienated young American.
While in his late rebellious

adolescence, during the collegiate r

identity crisis, he embraced the new
political consciousness of the late
’60s and his dawning realization of
the horrors of the Vietnam War and
the sense of betrayal it incurred led

him to reject adult society and

conventional American culture.

He has retreated, hurt, and built
up a life structure apart from
mainstream society. He feels his
carefully thought out political
beliefs are more highly evolved than
are the mainstream’s. Indeed, by
deﬁnition, people who enter into
and participate in conventional
society have not thought about the
world very carefully. He will,
consequently, usually embrace
Communism or—more likely—-soc-
ialism, anything but contemporary
mainstream America.

Of course, he considers himself
more ethically evolved. His job,
therefore, is picked on the criteria of
minimum involvement and ‘ ‘exploi-
ting” people the least. Working in a
large corporation is anathema to
him. He considers his esthetic
sense to be more highly developed
than is the mainstream’s. He
scorns WPEZ and 96 KX, enjoys
WYDD, positively delights in
WYEP and, in his more sublime
moments, tunes in WQED. His
automobile is simple, low priced—-
Volkswagen type. Its purchase

again indicates minimum involve-

ment in conventional society.

Besides, he rationalizes, it really is
superior to a Mercedes in that it
pollutes less and is more economi-

’ cal. Thus he is able to compound his

elitism by purchasing a low-priced,
low emission economical car, quite
neatly the opposite of what his
parents would have done to’ gain
status.

This person is obviously hurting.
He might get some enjoyment out of
-his continual elitist posturings, but
I really don’t think he gets much
pleasure from the aching alienation
out of the defense of which he
continues his elitism. This person
needs to begin uniting himself once
again with mainstream America, if
the hurt caused by Vietnam is ever
going to end. A good place to start
is to realize that people are
autonomous, just as autonomous as
he is. Mostidfilkmerica coulifhave

\ he been a KGB agent.

chosen to be alienated, but simply
chose not to be. And Ithink they are
happier for it.

Secondly, don’t judge the tastes
of people. Simply because someone
listens to WPEZ and enjoys it does
not automatically relegate him to a
lower intellectual status. This
person might also enjoy perusing
over Einstein’s ﬁeld equations and
trying to arrive at his own uniﬁed
ﬁeld theory. Even if this person did
not enjoy Einstein but was quite
materialistic-—-desired a house and a
big car and lots of gadgets—so
what? This is what he has chosen
and he is no less for it.

This leads me to the third thing I
feel the elitist should do to rid
himself of alienation. Don’t judge
other people. Cultivate an attitude
of love towards everybody, at least
prejudiciously. Embrace human
diversity. Come to realize that
everybody is just as much an
individual as he is.

For the alienated young Ameri-
can, while these might not be the
very best steps to take to end his
alienation, I feel that they could be a
beginning to reversing the course of
his destructive elitism.
apparent alternative is to continue
the rest of his life a psychic
stranger, feeding the Vietnam hurt,
and walling himself off from the
mainstream of society, while the
mainstream of society passes him
by.

A Communist A
Or A Dupe

As a loyal, anti-Communist
freedom ﬁghter, I am appalled that
you would print such tripe as that
written by Dan Mulholland.

Looking at the facts closely, it is
apparent that Mulholland is either a
Communist ora dupe. Admittedly,
he is attacking the ACLU, a group
considered “liberal.” ’But as any
serious student of Communism
knows, liberal groups are anathem-
ic to the Commies. Thus, we see
Mulholland employing a favorite
Communist propaganda technique,
attacking liberals.

As I understand it, the purpose of
the ACLU is to help American
citizens exercise their rights fully as
granted by our Founding Fathers
when they wrote the Constitution.
Mulholland obviously disagrees
with this goal as any Communist
would. It is in the interest of
Communism to see that the
American system does not work and
to discredit those who would have
the system work to every American
citizen’s beneﬁt.

Mulholland closes with a quota-
tion from Sen. Joseph McCarthy, a
man who could not have performed
Moscow’ s work more efﬁciently had

McCarthy
never found a single Communist
and made America look like Nazis
by sending his aides to burn books
in Europe shortly after World War
11. Yet McCarthy furthered
Communist aims by discrediting
honest Americans, forced the
retirement and/or silence of any
competent China and Southeast
Asia experts and totally discredited
‘ ‘ anti-Communism. ’ ’ Isn't it_ rather
strange that‘ a so-called anti-
Commie like Mulholland would
quote from someone who has so
thoroughly aided the Communist
cause? Perhaps Mulholland is
employing another Commie tactic
described by Robert Welch; trying
to dupe people into believing that he
is fighting Communism while in
reality aiding their cause.

Quit Griping
About the Champs

He Can’t Hold
Candle to Dylan

I would like to know what has
caused the big change in the
attitude of the Pitt students
concerning the Pitt football team.
Just weeks ago I was attending a
University where the students were
proud and boasting about their
national champions. Now it seems
their national champions are merely
students who don’t attend class and
quarterbacks who write unpleasant
grafﬁti on signs.

Tony Dorsett was in my
economics class winter term last
year and he attended class as often
as any other student. I was also in
the rhetoric class made reference to
in a Pitt News article; what the
student failed to explain was one
didn’t have to attend class not take
any tests providing one wrote a
paper at the end of the term. I am
sure more players than Jeff Delaney
care: about their grades and of
course I’m sure some don’t, but
then can’t you say the same for the‘
entire student body?

In reference to the sign displayed
for Greek week, where is your sense
of fair play? I've seen many a sign
where Greeks got on Greeks and
heard many fraternities and soror-
ities put each other down, but when
a football player does it, it’s
suddenly a terrible personal blow to
all the Greek organizations. V

Let’s face it; Pitt football has done
a lot for this University. Why not
mention the money donated for the
purchase of books to the Hillman
Library from the Sugar Bowl
winnings or the money made
throughout the season that goes
into the Athletic Fund to benefit all
athletics at Pitt? 1

I am sure everyone enjoyed
themselves at the games Saturday
afternoons and I am sure we'll all
enjoy ourselves next season. So
let's quit picking and let every
student, athlete or otherwise,
simply pursue his own goals and
ambitions in life. .

Still Wrong -One
Or Six Million

Recently, several books have
appeared “proving” that the
number of Jews who perished as a
result of Nazi crimes was not six
million but rather a fraction of that
number. -

Ibelieve it is just as evil to kill one
innocent Jew as it is to murder six
million people. Of course, the
unscrupulous Zionists have beneﬁt-
ted from what, in our opinion, is a .
human tragedy (it is, however, a
“Jewish tragedy” from their
limited point of view). While I
condemn all inhumanities commit-
ted by men against other men, I
believe that whether there was one’
single Jew or six million persecuted
in_ Nazi Germany, that still does not
entitle the Zionists to occupy one
inch ‘of Palestine, to kill one single
Palestinian or to expel anyone from
his homeland.

Those who carry out lengthy
research concerning the Jewish
population in Europe before and
after World War II in order to prove
that the holocaust destroyed less
than six million Jews waste their
own time; and when they send their
material to us, they waste their own
money as well as our time.

David Hawee

When _I saw the headline
“Stewart—The English Dylan Go-
ing Far(ther),” my first assumption
was that the mad prophet of the Pitt
News, Dan Mulholland, was
dipping into musical criticism. But
I then noticed that this absurdly-
titled article was penned by
someone other than Mulholland. I"
read on, hoping to discover what
could make anyone proclaim Al
Stewart a better musician than Bob
Dylan. "

Two statements in the review
must be singled out for criticism.
The ﬁrst is “...it is apparent that
Stewart can reach and manipulate
music at ﬁne and delicate depths
that Dylan has yet to plunder.” The
second is equally galling to anyone
who has listened to Dylan with any
kind of seriousness: “This English
Dylan for the ’70s separated from
his American forerunner by light-
year of of musical progress” (sic).

It is a critic’s right to express his

opinion. It is a critic's duty to
provide a justification for that
opinion. Fareri has failed to do the
latter. If one is going to compare
Dylan with Stewart. some portion of
the comparison should be devoted
to Dylan’s alleged failings when

measured against Stewart.; For if .

indeed Stewart has 
Dylan by a “light-yearof musical
progress,” I would like to be told
why.

. The only reference to Dylan in the
way of “support” for the writer's
contention is a description of
Dylan’s lyrics as down-to-earth and
literal. This is akinto saying that
T.S. Elliot is a very simple poet.
Dylan’s lyrics reach a depth that no
other rock lyricist canmatch. Books
have been written trying to explain
the lyrics and college courses are
being taught about Dylan as a poet.
I ask Fareri to listenclosely to “All
Along The Watchtower,” “Ballad
of a‘ Thin Man”; and “Gates of
Eden” among the very many
complex lyrics Dylan has penned
and then reconsider his views as to
the simplicity of Dylan’s songs.

As a musician Dylan is similarly
excellent. He is one of the two or
three best harmonica players in the
world. He is very good on both the
piano and the guitar. His voice,
while admittedly throaty, is capable
of infusing the emotion into his
songs that most of them require.
Dylan is an originator. He began
the folk rock tradition that groups
like Crosby Stills Nash and Young
and America would later capitalize
on.

I can sympathize with Mr.
Fareri’s intent. He is obviously a
great admirer of Stewart; he is self-
evidently unfamiliar with Dylan’s
work. What better way to promote
Stewart’s career than to brand him
as another Dylan? Such a tag has
done wonders for Springsteen's
career and will probably be aboon
to Patti Smith's career; to be called
another Dylan is to be accorded the
highest praise in the world of rock
music. Had Fareri merely
identiﬁed Stewart as another Dylan
and said no more, he review would
be well-received. But in claiming
that Stewart has surpassed Dylan,
Fareri has lost all credibility. His
otherwise well-founded praise of
Stewart as being a very talented
musician is thereby nulliﬁed.

I am a midwest college athletic

come to one conclusion: it stinks or
better still, it is SNAFU.

I have become a hockey fan
attending several high school

plays on a local high school team.

I just can’t understand the whole
set—up against the sports program
when all the talent any school could
ask for is within touching here in

From what I have read, heard and

hree Rivers Fishing

By RANDY GAYSEK

Fishing has been a sport and
source of relaxation since the time
manfirst found he didn't have to do
it to eat anymore. The problem is,
too many people have tried to
reduce it to a science by bringing in
technological advances such as
fancy graphite poles, reels with
automatic transmissions, depth
gauges and even sonar, which are
bound to return ﬁshing to the status
of work.

But there is still a place where
ﬁshing is simple and basic and,
most important, relaxing. You may
ask, “Where?” You get three
guesses and if you answer the
Monongehala, the Allegheny and
the Ohio Rivers, you win the
Tipparillo.

People may scoff at the idea of
ﬁshing in Pittsburgh’s rivers.
Rumor has it the rivers are far too
polluted and junky to support any
decent, self-respecting species of
ﬁsh. But this vicious rumor is
unfounded, says‘ the Pennsylvania
Fish Commission.

One ofﬁcer of the commission
said that within a 10-mile radius of

it ATime For Relaxation

the Point, it’s possible to ﬁnd most
species of warm water North
American ﬁsh. He said bass,
crappies, blue-gill and walleyes are
actually quite common and the only
reason people don’t catch them is
because most people don’t use the
right kind of bait. Simple
logic--true_ in every day life. ’

So it is possible for an avid angler

,.to do some serious line dunking

around Pittsburgh if he’s willing to
invest in equipment like a
reasonably good rod and reel and
bait like earthworms and lures.
Modest investments, agreed, but
there is an even more fundamental
school of Pittsburgh river ﬁshing.
For those interested primarily in
simply throwing a baited hook into
the water and pulling something‘
alive and wiggling out in about ﬁve
minutes, there is little to compare in
ﬁshing circles with carp ﬁshing on
the Ohio River.

First, you need a license.
Technically. But the Fish
Commission rarely checks for
licenses of people who are
obviously ﬁshing for carp. If you
want to be safe, they’re only $7.75
and good till December. Other

requirements for a good day of carp
ﬁshing line, a few hooks and.a half
pound of doughball. -

The ﬁrst few items, including a
license, can be found in any
hardware shop, but doughball, .
which can be likened to ambrosia for
carp, is something best made at
home. The recipe for this sure-ﬁre
carp baitis short and_ easy.

First, take a half cup of
all-purpose ﬂour and a half cup of
yellow corn meal. Sift these
together and add water—a tea-
spoon at a time—to make a gooey

paste reminiscent of the Blob.
Next, season to taste. No kidding.
Carp love different tasting dough-
ball so add a little vanilla extract or
other aromatic flavoring.

After the ﬂavoring is added, tie
the goop into an old tee shirt or
better yet, cheesecloth if you can
ﬁnd some. Secure the ends and
drop the whole thing into a pot of
rapidly boiling water. Cook it like
this for about 20 minutes, poking
frequently. When the doughball
resists your pokes, give it another
ﬁve minutes, remove it from the

Thinness Not ‘In’ (With Anorexia

B)’ LESLEY SAYELL

Women love the thought of being

slender, thin and/or, skinny.

7 Thinness .is “in” today; by the
1980's the ideal female ﬁgure may
resemble the proportions of a
popsicle stick--straight up and
down and ﬂat.

Some girls walk around looking
like that today, but others are
emaciated and malnutritioned and
are unaware of their illness.

They are victims of anorexia
nervosa—a rare disease (of which
there is noknown medical illness to
account for it and the weight loss),
difﬁcult to diagnose but characteris-
tically identiﬁable.

According to Dr. Gordon Foster,
general psychiatrist at Western
Psychiatric Hospital, if a patient
does not meet the specific
symptoms of anorexia, it is not the
disease that causes the weight loss.

“The disease has to start before
age 25, ’ ’ Foster said, “and anorexia
must accompany a 25 percent
decrease in weight according to the
Metropolitan Life tables in ﬁnding
the correct height and weight for
someone at any given age.”

Foster said anorexia patients are
thin, pathologically thin, but feel
physically well and are comfortable
at a weight of about 70 pounds.

“There is an implacable denial to
the fact that they are sick,” Foster
said. “They distort their body
image such that they think they look
becoming when they are actually
emaciated,” he said.

Elaborating . bu the physical
symptoms of anorexia, -Foster
explained- the patient must have at
least two of the following manifesta-

tions: 1) amenorrhea-discontinua-_

tion of menstruation cycle, 2)
lanugo——characterized as very f'me
white hair as seen on newborns, 3)

~ bradycardia—persistent resting
pulse of 70 or less (normal heartrate
is‘ about 80), 4) periods of
overactivity and S) vomiting, which
may be self-induced.

‘ ‘Only half of r all kids fall into the
category of vomiters,” Foster said.
‘ ‘Most of them are dieters but there
is another whole crew of kids who
will either chug a gallon of water or

put their ﬁnger down their throat ,‘
and regurgitate after every meal, '

thus maintaining their thinness.”
Anorexia victims exhibit an
unusual boarding or handling of
food whether it is storin g food under
a bed or behind a radiator (never
intending to eat it-—-just packing it
away) or to prepare elaborate meals
for the family, which they serve but
do not participate in themselves.
“These food handling rituals are
always present,” Foster said.
“There is always much more
concern and worry going on outside
these girls’ heads than inside,”
Foster said. “Everyone is
mobilized to help them but they are
indifferent to the disease. lt’s hard
to treat anorexia when the patient
doesn't want to treat it,” he said.
Foster said patients with anorexia
use it to become the center of power
in their family. He added it is a’

“vengeful process" because pa-
tients are generally hospitalized
between two to four times
throughout treatment. -

Foster receives the overﬂow of
anorexia patients that Children's
Hospital have difﬁculty in treating.
These girls usually have had the
disease for ﬁve to eight years.
Foster said the hospital claims to

treat about 20 anorexia patients a

year.
Anorexia has a side effect on
parents of the girls with the disease,

' Foster said. He discovered that

parents usually feel guilty, as if they
were responsible for their child
contracting anorexia, and conse-
quently, Foster organized a group
called the “Parents of Thin
Things.”
These parents keep weekly
behavioral journals on their child-
A ren and after comparing notes, they
realize the disease affects other
anorexia victims in much the same
way. Some parents have described
how their daughter bought another
peasant gown or how she joined the
track team with intentions to hide
and lose even more weight.
Once inside Western‘ Psych,
Foster tells his patients they must
gain half a pound a day or else they

will be tube fed. When they gain-
weight, the psychological process

emerges. “They become hateful,
psychotic and depressed,” Foster
said.

tricks of the trade to lie to me.”
Foster said. “I always tell these

kids that I trust them to deceive me
on every occasion—this is the only
posture I can take,” Foster said.
He pointed out that girls have
been known to sew rocks in the hem

pot, untie the teeshirt and allow to
cool.

When the doughball is thorough-
ly cool, knead it into a ball, gather
your other equipment and head
down Ohio River Boulevard (route
65 for you cartographers) to the
Emsworth locks.

Just after you get into Emsworth,
there’s a road off to the left that
takes you fairly close to the ﬂood
control locks. You don’t actually
ﬁsh on the locks themselves," but
rather at the intake of the locks. The
steady ﬂux of water attracts huge
and feisty carp in droves. V

You must cross some train tracks,
then descend a steep retaining wall
to get to the water, but there is a
convenient ledge on which to sit.

Once you’ve made yourself com- ‘

fortable, tie your line onto the stick
in such a way that it’s not likely to
come off when you get a bite. Next,

‘ tie a hook on the other end of the

line. You may not need 50 feet, but
you should be able to judge/how
much is appropriateionce you get
there. _

Take about an ounce of doughball
and. mold it around the hook,
making sure the barb is well-
hidden. Carp have good eyesight
and if they suspect a hook, they
'won’t bite. Then, just toss the bait
as far as you can into the water. You
won't need a lead sinker because
the doughball will weigh the line
down on its own. Now just wait.

Let the current flux play with your ' '

bait and don’t be fooled into

  The Secret of Learning

Ever wonder why some people breeze through their
courses while you struggle along with mediocre results? I'll
tell you why! They know how to study and you don't.

Billions of dollars are spent each year on education with
almost none of it going toteach you how to learn. Yet the
rewards for high—speed learners have never been greater.
When you know how to learn you can master any subject,
any problem and any job—quick|y and easily.

regular reviews of your lecture notes and readings, periodic
updates of a set of formal notes and outline plus a study pro-
gram designed to fit each day's new material into the body of
knowledge you are accumulating.

The complete program for Goal Achievement Study is of-
fered in my book The Easy Way to Higher Grades. This no
nonsense, down to earth book will not only show you how to
learn but how to obtain the highest possible grades with the
least amount of effort. My book, written at the urging of for—\
mer students will show you: .
How to know in advance at least 80 percent of the questions

of any exam
How to eliminate the frustration of long hours of wasted

study
How to conquer the subject that always gives you trouble
How to avoid the one grade rut (I always get C's)
How to cure exam nerves.

_ When you adopt the program of Goal Achievement Study
you can expect to raise your grades at least one letter grade
within one semester. Thousands have already.

in todays tough job market you need every advantage. And
a record, of high grades is the best advantage you can have.
if you are serious about your career you owe it to yourself to
try this book which I am offering on a money back guarantee.
You risk nothing. 4

muddled interviews with him—re-
vealing his war record, love life, etc.
——the representatives of this
organization (Richard-Widmark and
Edward Albert) promise him
freedom, money, a house and his
wife (Candice Bergen). All he has to

do (if you can ﬁgure it out through
all the soul-searching) is act as a hit
man for them. The victim at this
time is not revealed. For that
matter, he never clearly is.

Well, our man takes the bait,
despite the warnings of his buddy
and cellmate (Mickey Rooney), who
himself is ruthlessly shot down
when the two make their pre-

arranged escape from prison. Uh‘

huh. Hackman—-and the audience
—is left pretty much in the dark
about whatever is going on.

All that the secret types have
promised him comes to pass and for
a few scenes that are only slightly
less boring than the others,
Hackman and Bergen share their
happiness in a nameless, supposed-
ly Latin American country. Then
Hackman is called upon—forced,

really—to do the job he was hired
for. Nobody ever bothers to say
exactly who will be killed, but
anybody left awake in the audience
can usually ﬁgure out what all this
hubbub is for.

The ﬁlm goes on from there to a
somewhat predictable, if unsatisfy-
ing end. Many people get shot, the
guys who you never believed in the
ﬁrst place prove to be untrust-
worthy and nobody takes the
trouble to explain things.

Not that there is all that much
mystery in “Domino.” The big
puzzlers seem to be why this
organization (whatever it was) put
up so much money and trouble into
a guy they never needed, why
Bergen was out into a fright wig and
transformed from '/one of the world’s

most glamorous women into

of the things I felt about Genesis, in
fact, was that we promised more
than we delivered.”

Not the herald of the Apocalypse,
even though he sings, “...the seven

trumpets blowing sweet rock and

. from the Tower of Babel.”

Peter Gabriel wears mirrored
contact lenses, they make his eyes
empty of himself, full of reflections.
“Drink up..."

A consummate performer, Gab-
riel delivers on so many levels,
seriously and ironically. He is one
of the few performers who can raise
rock to drama, if not art. His stage
presense rivals Mick Jagger for
unabashed eroticism and natural
androgyny.

Gabriel owes more to extra-musi-
cal sources than Jagger, though—
Jagger embodies rock, Gabriel
transcends it. He mim.es the
“character actors from the Tower of

Babel." We are made aware of a
presense that is not Peter Gabriel
but an entourage of persona slipped
on like new skins. ,

Continual accented songs; not a

Randy Newman. As he descended
through the crowds, gently accost-

Then, there are the raps.
Surrealistic prologues to the tunes;
witty observations. .“‘How do you

introduction to “Slowburn,” which

 Stage Helps Dispel I Myths

By MARTHA H. GARVEY, JR.

7

“You mean,’ said my shocked
friend, “there are theaters in Latin
America?” .

His eyes ﬁlled with the Latitli
American myth: savage gauchos,
human sacriﬁces and high coffee
prices. Latin America as cultural
jungle. ‘

But the jungle is a myth. Latin
American theater is so active, it has
invaded Pittsburgh. Three Latin
American plays will be presented in
the Social Room of Stephen Foster
Theater tonight at 8 p.m.

The performing group is a Pitt
Spanish American theater class
taught by professor Julio Matas.
“To understand theater,” he said,
“it is necessary to participate.”

His willing participants are 30
students, undergraduate and grad-
uate, American and Latin Ameri-
can. They have done everything
from acting and directing to making
moustaches. The three directors of
the pieces are all students.

The plays—with nary a gaucho in
them—embrace both the ridiculous
and the tragic. “Study in White
and Black” is an absurdity about
the way all arguments start:

    

somebody saying something dumb.
“Three Dialogues” are vignettes
about what people do when they
don’t eat or sleep-T-—talk. The
dialogues include and intellectual
battle between a world-weary
dragon and a crafty saint.
Outstanding among them is a
semi-seduction of a lonely man in a
wheelchair by an equally lonely but
enterprising (obviously) widow.
The evening ends with an

emotional explosion. “Ladies at
Play,” written by Matas. is the

reunion of three sisters. One has
married an American. The other
two, single and trapped in Cuba,
have devoted their lives to hating
her. When she returns, it is to two

human vultures.
“You have forgotten notmng,"

says the sister, sleekly American-
ized. Her sisters, maddened by
their 40 year-old jealously, play a
game with her that makes Russian
roulette look like checkers.

Latin American theatre is dif-
ferent, focusing on the unexpected.

as talentless and pretentious
pseudo-artists. Listening to
Television’s , debut album, “Mar-

notions.

Television is led by guitarist/ voc-
alist Tom Verlaine. He had a hand
in Patti Smith’s “Horses” LP and
seems to have adopted her as
spiritual godmother on “Marquee
Moon.” The album has shadows of
“Horses” running through every
track, but Verlaine has enough style
and direction of his own to
incorporate this big influence
without killing originality.

“You know, it's like some new

Verlaine’s vocal is but a point

They pick out the sharp melodic
lines that Verlaine has chosen above
the traditional chord.

The lyrics, like the music, don’t
work via content or anything
tangible. Objects are suggested by
images and tone, as in a dream. The
songs are abstract musical sculp-
tures, seeking to discover form
incompletely and from a variety of
perspectives. Some of the titles
sound similar to physics lessons:

Haywire 1 J
By Brooke Hayward
Alfred A. Knopf 7

Author Brooke Hayward is a child
of Hollywood’s golden era. Her
mother, Margaret Sullivan. was
one of the most popular actresses of
the ’30s and early '40s. Her father,
Leland Hayward, was a highly
successful theatrical agent (clients
included Ernest Hemingway, Greta
Garbo, Judy Garland and Fred
Astaire) who later turned producer
(his credits include both the stage
and screen versions of “Mr.
Roberts”).

Brooke was a cover girl for ‘ ‘Life”
magazine at age 15. Together with

siblings Bridget and Bill, she was »

brought up in the best Hollywood
tradition: children’s parties with
Jane and Peter Fonda (Henry Fonda
had once been married to Sullivan),
socializing with the likes of Joshua
Logan, Jimmy Stewart and Cole
Porter.
» After '10 vears of marriage,
Hayward and Sullivan (between the
two of them, they eventually
accumulated 9 marriages) split.
Both Bill and Bridget spent time in
mental institutions. Sullivan dies
from an overdose of sleeping pills.
Six months later, Bridget is found
dead after an epileptic attack. A
friend tells Brooke, “You’re right,
it’s the worst family history that
anyone ever hadand either you
jump out the window or you live.”
Brooke chose to live and 15 years
after her sister's death, she tells the
family’s history in “Haywire.” It is
not a self-pitying or self-indulgent
book. Portraits are not clouded by
sentiment, although the love is
obviously there. "

"‘Haywire” begins with a chapter

survivors were “those who gave
their islands to survive.”

The subtle consonance of Genesis
might lie only with that particular
group of musicians, but the group
with Peter Gabriel proved equally
competent, though more hard-edg-
ed. Basically the same lineup as on
his solo album, they complemented
the rich textures of Gabriel’s songs.
Steve Hunter played leather guitar
and Robert Fripp played ambience.
Two keyboard players (augmented
at times by Gabriel on grand piano)
filled the sound commendably. The
bassist, ‘drummer and manic
percussionist drove the music to its
moment;

The quality of execution was as

eclectic as the music itself——“non-

and Randy Newman.

The effect was clear, loud,

F

It is almost certain that ABC will announce sometime this
week that it would be willing to broadcast nationally Pitt’s
1977 Penn State and Notre Dame football contests if Pitt
were willing to switch starting times and dates for the Pitt
Stadium games.

And, a Pitt spokesman said yesterday, Pitt would be
more than willing to switch Notre Dame with Florida and
move the Penn State game back one week, since the schoo‘

would make a half-million dollars by doing so.

“It’s more than speculation,” a Pitt spokesman said
yesterday. “We’ve heard nothing official from ABC, but
we hope to get some word in a day or so. We'd be happy to
make the schedule switches required, but nothing has been
conﬁrmed.” V

The plan would involve moving the Penn State game from
Nov. 19 to Nov. 26, when it would become part of a
Thanksgiving doubleheader. The Notre Dame game,
currently set for Oct. 8, would take Florida's Sept. 19 spot
and become an attractive opener for ABC’s college football
season.

Florida then would host Pitt in Gainesville Oct. 8. “They
would go for that,” the Pitt spokesman said.‘
reason-—Florida, which wanted its Sept. 10 opener with Pitt
to be a regional offering, would receive a regional telecast
later in the season. A —

5 Should the changes be made, the Notre Dame contest
would begin at 4:20 and Penn State’s first game at Pitt
Stadium in some time would start at 12:30 p.m. , Nov. 26, as
the first end of the doubleheader. 1

The two games would be Pitt’s only television exposure
via ABC next season, since a team is allowed a maximum of
four telecasts over a two-year period and the Panthers were
on three times last season. The extra appearance is legal
since several of the appearances are of the “specia ”
variety——the game date, time or location has been changed,
or it has been part of a special package.

' Five non‘-bowl appearances, however, is the absolute
maximum, so the two national broadcasts would be Pitt’s
way of gaining as much exposure as is possible under the
NCAA-ABC rules.

The rearrangement of opposition ﬁgures to help Pitt in
the casebof Penn State’s date, but could hurt the Panthers
withfthe new opening foe.

The week between the Army game at East Rutherford,

NJ... and the Penn State invasion would be more than

welcome, and needed time to spend preparing for the
revenge-bent Lions.

But Notre Dame has more than the Golden Dome going ,

for it this season—24 players who once were starters return
(including redshirts) and even Notre Dame can only use 22
at atime. So this year, the Irish are deep in more than fans.
Notre Dame, therefore, becomes a tough team to tackle
ﬁrst, but that’s what they said last year, too.

No matter what ABC’s decision, Pitt officials would like
to know soon. The uncertainty concerning the schedule is

Kholding up pre-season preparations.

 

The‘

ND, Penn St. Switches Coming

“We need to know,” said the spokesman. “It really has
been holding us up. We have things like ticket brochures,
calendars and other mailing items that we need a ﬁrm
schedule for.

“But we do expect to hear from them soon, even though
we haven’t so far,” he said. ‘‘It could be tomorrow, or it

could be the next day.”

The only persons who would appear to lose in the deal
would be’ less-than-wealthy Panther followers who won't
gain anything, since they’ll probably be at the Stadium for
both games, anyway, and the changes would preclude the
telecast ofvany away games.

Cut the Apostrophe

It’s. sad, but Pitt fans can start preparations for the
coming Panther football season by taking the apostrophe
out of ‘ ‘We’re number one,” both in chants and on buttons.

We were number one.

.. Q

    

ackles like this one againstiwest Virginia have earned
Pitt’s Randy Holloway (70) the reputation of a strong

Now, according to The Football News’ pre-season
rankings, we’re number four. That publication predicts the
apostrophe will go to Michigan in 1977, with Notre Dame
and Ohio State also ahead of Pitt.

But that news isn’t as bad as spoiled Pitt fans‘ are likely to
ﬁnd it. Fourth isn’t a bad position from which to start.

It’s within striking distance, since you’re only three
teams’ losses from the top, and it’s high enough to brag

~ about-—at least, it’s nothing of which to be ashamed.

pre-season All-America picks, since five Panthers are on
the list.

Matt Cavanaugh, who is being pushed (by Pitt, at least)
for the Heisman Trophy, and Randy Holloway, who has a
better shot at the Outland Trophy, are on the ﬁrst
All-American list to come out, as is defensive back Bob
Jury, who was a third-teamer at the end of last season.

Tom Brzoza was selected as lineman-of-the-year, before
the fact, by Football News and, of course, made ﬁrst-team
All-America.

The most surprising selection was that of Gordon Jones,
the crowd‘-controlling receiver who could use his junior

' season to prove that what have been_infrequent ﬂashes of '

fantastic ability have not been made in a pan. His promise,
however, is more than justiﬁcation for the All-America
prediction, even though he has yet to accomplish even a
small portion of his potential achievements.

Players who could merit post-season mention, but who
are not found in Football News’ listings, include Elliott
Walker, J ury’s three fellow defensive backs (Jeff Delaney,
LeRoy Felder and J .C. Wilson) and, because he’ll be in a
very, good place at an opportune moment, middle guard
Dave Logan.

The biggest question mark of the moment for Pitt, a team
that returns approximately half a national champion, is the
kicking game. John Majors’ frequent boast that “Carson
Long and Larry Swider performed every kick in my four
years” must be grating on Jackie Sherrill’s ears by now.
There is, to put it simply, no punter or placekicker plainly in
sight. _. .

The coaches still are looking at punters; they’ve even
tried to recruit one from the student body. And that new kid
who was supposed to be Long's replacement on the ﬁeld
goal and extra-point team, Dave Trout? He showed up at a
Pitt practice the other day to kick a few with the guys, who

kickers on the present squad.

Each took 27 shots at the crossbar. Though the farthest
the group went out was the 30-yard line, Trout missed a
dozen attempts, about as many asvthe other two combined.

Angels Appear Heavenly in AL West q  

By RICH HARRY

(This is the first in a series of
prediction on the 1977 major league
baseball divisional races.)

The countdown begins for major
league baseball's opening day and
no division will attract more

. attention this season than the

American League (AL)West, where
expansion and the controversial
reentry draft have signiﬁcantly
modiﬁed that division’s balance of
power. -
A The California Angels, perennia
second-division ﬁnishers, have to
be rated the favorites to take the
title this year after signing through
free agency three bona-fide stars,
while the Oakland Athletics, in
losing seven key players, will
plunge near the bottom after years
of dominating the West.

CALIFORNIA ANGELS

Millionaire cowboy and team
owner Gene Autry corralled a triad
of stars in Joe Rudi, Don Baylor and
Bobby Grich, adding some des-
perately needed punch to the
California lineup. Whether the
players are worth the reported $4.5
million Autry shelled out for them is
another question.

Rudi, widely considered one of
the best performers in the game,
will join Bobby Bonds and Bruce
Bochte in the Angel outﬁeld.
Bonds, coming off an injury, has a
chance to steal _30 bases and hit 30
homers now. that opposing teams

can’t pitch around him with Rudi or
Baylor following him in the lineup.

Baylor will be at ﬁrst base and
will shoulder much of the power
supply for the Angels. He cracked
15 last year. Steady Bobby Grich
will play at short, while defensive
gems Jerry Remy at second and
Dave Chalk at third round out the
inﬁeld, regarded as the best in team
history.

(.317, 30 homers, 117 RBI in the
minors) will handle the designated
hitting chores.

For starting pitching, manager
Norm Sherry has the best
righty-lefty combo in the league
with Frank Tanana and Nolan Ryan.

The irrepressible Tanana, a
19-game winner, combined with
Ryan last season to earn 588
strikeouts, an astronomical two-
man ﬁgure.

Completing the starting ﬁve will
be lefty Sid Monge (ERA - 3.36)
and righthanders Paul Hartzell
(2.77) and Gary Ross (3.00) while
Mickey Scott and veteran Dick
Drago are the principles in the
buﬂpen.

The Angels are heading for
unlimited heights.

KANSAS CITY ROYALS

Despite an impressive array of

too short on pitching depth and
home run power to recapture the
division title.

Kansas City will depend on solid
defense and running speed for
contention. The keystone combina-
tion of Freddie Patek and Frank
White, coupled with centerﬁelder
Amos Otis, offer a ﬁne set of gloves
up the middle. In addition, the
three accumulated 97 stolen bases.

Offensively, the Royals are led by
batting champ George Brett (.333)
and designated hitter-outﬁelder
Hal McRae (.320). Outﬁelders Tom
Poquette and Al Cowens added
last-season marks of .302 and .265,
respectively.

Not bad credentials, but for the
Royals to repeat, big ﬁrst baseman
John iMayberry must rebound
from an off-year in which his home
run total dipped from 34 in 1975 to
13 in 1976. V

Catcher Darrel Porter, obtained
in an off-season deal with the
Milwaukee Brewers, is also counted
on to provide some punch. He hit
only ﬁve out of the park last season
but has been in double ﬁgures most
of his career.

If Steve Busby overcomes
shoulder surgery and returns to his
20-game form of two years ago, he
will form a respectable starting staff
with Dennis Leonard (17 wins),
southpaw Paul Splittorff (11-8,
3.96), Doug Bird (12-10,’ 3.36) and
Marty Pattin (8-l4,_2.49).

Mingori, who chipped in with 10
game-savers.

The power shortage came early to
Kansas City last year, but if
manager Whitey Herzog comes up
with an extra supply of muscular
bats—and luck-—the Royals may
ﬁnd themselves on top.

TEXAS RANGERS

For the first time in recent
years the Rangers may make a
serious bid for the title, or at least
mainly on the
strength of a 35-years-old shortstop
and a rookie second baseman with a
famous father.

Bert Campaneris, secured from
rival Oakland in the free agent
draft, and Bump Wills (Maury’s
son) will prowl the middle of the
Texas diamond a'nd lend some
defense that constantly booted
chances last season.

Not only that, but Campaneris
swiped 54 bases a year ago and
Wills is a second baseman with
power, ‘drilling 26 homers in the
min’ors'lastyear—: ' ' " ‘ s ‘ ‘ '"

SPORTS  

Rounding out the inﬁeld at the
corners are the ﬁrst baseman Mike
Hargrove, who led‘ the team in
batting at .287, and Toby Harrah (15
homers, 67 RBI).

With the trade of Jeff Burroughs
to the Atlanta Braves, the Rangers
are short on sock in the outﬁeld.
Ken Henderson, acquired in
exchange for Burroughs, is good for
perhaps 15 roundtrippers but his

. companions in left and center, Juan

Beniques and recenly Athletic
Claudell Washington, totalled only
ﬁve last year.

Designated hitter Tom Grieve can
be counted on for some power; he
punched out 20 homers last season
and added 81 runs batted in.

Catcher Jim Sundberg is the
best at his position in the league-—a
Gold Glove 1976——but he hit only
.228.

Milwaukee Drinking To
Victorious Marquette

MILWAUKEE (AP)-.—“This
crowd is just like it was when the
Braves won the World Series. It’s
younger. but just as big,” the
elderly man observed, vying for
viewing position with an estimated
15,000 shrieking beer-chugging
Marquette University fans Tuesday
morning. ,

The scene occurred several hours
after Marquette had won the
NCAA basketball championship.
The mob scene had shifted from
trafﬁc-snarled Wisconsin Ave., the
city’s main thoroughfare, to.Mitch-
ell.Field's main air terminal, where
fans awaited the Warriors’ charter
flight from Atlanta.

When it arrived, shortly before 2
a.m., 6-foot-10 center Jerome
Whitehead, heroiof the Warriors’
last-second semiﬁnal victory over
North Carolina-Charlotte Saturday,
was the first Warrior player off the
runway.

“We're No. 1,” thundered ‘the...

crowd. Then the chants changed to
“We want Al” and “Give ’em
hell, Al.”

But Al McGuire, the retiring
Marquette coach whose 404th
career victory had brought an
NCAA championship, was hustled
off to-a side exit by harried airport
security. So were others in his
entourage, including members of
his family, Wisconsin Gov. Patrick
J. Lucey and the Rev. John ‘P.
Raynor, S.J., Marquette president.

A beaming Lucey was reminded
that Marquette’s was the second
NCAA championship won by a
Wisconsin team within three days.
The University of Wisconsin had

won the NCAA hockey title in‘

Detroit during the ‘weekend.
“To think that the fans of

.the Milwaukee Braves’

  W

K

Wisconsin had to sit through two
overtime games to pull the Badgers
through," the governor said.
“Then to see Marquette win like
this.

“I would really like to think I
helped a bit," he said, “except
what good would my Irish luck have
done compared to that of Al
McGuire?”

Semi-normalcy had returned to
the Marquette campus later Tues-
day, with classes in session as
usual. But the emotional outpour-
ing isn’t over in Milwaukee, which
until Marquette’s 67-59' victory
over North Carolina in the NCAA
finals in Atlanta Monday night had
savored only two national cham-
pionships of its major sports teams:
World
Series triumph in 1957 and the
Milwaukee Bucks’ 1971 .National
Basketball Association title.

A Wednesday morning rally is
planned on the Marquette campus,
to be followed by a motorcade
transporting the Warrior team to a
downtown hotel for a community
tribute. The sponsoring Metro-
politan Milwaukee Association of
Commerce reported all 900 tickets
at $8 apiece,’were sold within 42
miniites yesterday.

(Continued from Page 16)

In the bullpen, Steve Foucault
(8-8, 3.32) and Paul Lindblad (6-5,
3.05) are counted on to boost last
year’s team total of 15 saves.

CHICAGO WHITE SOX

What can be said of a team that
has two Lemons (manager Bob

“Lemon and outﬁelder Chet Lemon)

on its roster? Not much, other than
it won’t be a sweet season this year
on Chicago's South Side.
Manager Lemon has a bushel of
worries in the pitching department,
which ﬁnished with an inﬂated 4.25
ERA last season. Only Ken Brett is
guaranteed a startingassignment.
He won 10 while dropping 12 last
year, but completed - 16 games,
perhaps signaling an end to the arm
problems that have plagued him
throughout his career.
Accompanying Brett in the
rotation will probably be Bart
Johnson (9-16, 4.73), "Francisco
Barrios (5-9, 4.31) and Steve Stone.
Compounding Lemon’s dilemma
is the status of Wilbur Wood, the
knuckleball artist. Wood was out of
the lineup for most of the 1976

But the mortality rate-of anorexia
is 10 to 15 percent. Foster said it is a
serious disease in that some
patients get so malnutritioned they
do not have defenses to ﬁght off’
infection. ‘

Females account for 98 percent of
anorexia cases, but Foster treated a
male who had the disease for nine
years. The boy weighed 63 pounds
before Foster treated him and he
had undergone nine years of
psycho-analytical therapy. After
the boy built his weight back up to
146 pounds, he grew three to four
inches, Foster said, and developed
into his adolescence at 17.

Why did this boy 'contract
anorexia and you did. not? “It is my
bias that I have to respond as Freud
did 70 years ago—there are certain
physical genetic differences be-
tween people that predispose the
manisfestation behavior of this
disease,” Foster said.

The study of anorexia is a
side-bar interest to Foster’s usual
motor activities, which are sleep
and depression research at Western
Psych. Foster places the major
emphasis on the ‘psycho-biological
approach to anorexia. “We look at
the biology of psychological pro-
cesses ﬁrst,” he said.

This is why Foster excludes all
known medical diseases that could
account for weight loss, such as
pituitary disease, diabetes, chronic
infections such as tuberculosis and
brain tumors.

Hospital, X-rays with medical
exams must be completed before a
person can be properly diagnosed.
“Anyone who tries to treat
anorexia on an out-patient -basis I

think is guilty of malpractice,”

Foster said. “You ca.t1~t;reat‘it.iafter.~
/

you have done all the medical tests,
but the first time around you need a
comprehensive medical examina-
tion in the hospital,” he said.

‘ ‘Ithink the disease is much more
common than you would expect
because it is so infrequently
diagnosed,” Foster said. “Before
seeing me patients had been treated
by doctors who overlooked the
disease. These doctors think the
way lay people think about diets.
This is why I want to be careful in
distinguishing dieting from anor-
exia,” he said.

Foster exmphasized there is no
relationship between anorexia and
dieting because anorexia is a rare
and discreet disease. Foster could
not elaborate on what constitutes a
good diet, but the doctor could reply
as to what is a bad diet.

“A bad diet is one in which you
loose 25 percent of your weight,”
Foster said.

season with injuries and may not be
back. ‘

The rest of the starting eight look
more promising than the pitching
corps, in light of the acquisition of
power-hitting Richie Zisk and the
maturity of sophomores Kevin Bell
and Chet Lemon.

Zisk brings with him 21 homers,
89 RBI and a .289 batting mark.
Bell, a third baseman, is expected to
triple last year’s home run output of
ﬁve. Outﬁelder Lemon can ﬂy, has
a series of high batting marks in the
minors and will probably boost last
year’s totals of .246 and 13 stolen
bases.

Completing Lemon’s lineup will
be Jim Spencer (70 RBIs and a good
glove at ﬁrst), Jorge Orta (.274, 14
HR, 72 RBI) at second, Bucky Dent
(.246. in an off-season) at short,
Ralph Garr (.300) in left, Brian
Downing behind the plate and
Lamar Johnson (.320 in limited
duty) as the designated hitter.

Not a bad lineup, but it’ll still be a
drab season for the White Sox.

MINNESOTA TWINS

If White Sox manager Bob
Lemon has pitching problems by the
bushels, then Twins’ skipper Gene
Mauch has them by the truckload.

First, he lost Bill Campbell,
American League Fireman of the
Year, to Boston in the free agent
draft and then Bill Singer went to
Toronto via expansion, leaving
Mauch only with Dave Goltz‘ as a
dependable hurler (14 wins, 3.36).

The remaining rotation will be
ﬁnalized after spring training; but
Jim Hughes (9-14, 4.98), Pete
Redfern (8-8, 3.51), Jim Gideori and
Steve Luebber will probably get the
nod.

The bullpen has been «devastated
with the defection of Campbell, who
led the majors last year with 78
appearances. In all likelihood, Tom
Burgmeier and Vic Albury will head
the relief corps.

Mauch has fewer problems with
his offense, which provides a fine
blend of speed, power and high
batting marks. Outﬁelders Dan
Ford and Larry I-[isle slammed 20
and 14 homers, respectively, last
year while catcher Butch Wynegar
contributed ten as a rookie. All three
provide some punch in the middle of
the Twins lineup.

Hitting in front of them will be 8

Lymon Bostock (.323) and superstar
Rod Carew (331). The pair stole 61
bases between them last season.

The inﬁeld remains intact with
Carew at first, Bob Randell (.267) at
second, Roy Smalley (.259) at short
and Mike Cubbage (.257) at third.
Craig Kusick, who slammed 11
homers in part-time duty, returns
as designated hitter.

The Twins may score a lot of runs,
but so will the opposition.

bly rear its ugly head on the

signals, overthrows to the wrong
base or any other misplay that can
turn a manager's hair gray (in this

Barring trades, Johnson will ﬁeld
a lineup of Danny Meyer (.252) at

youngsters at the keystone and
veteran Steve Braun at third.

The outﬁeld will consist of Rupert
Jones (the number-one draft pick),
Dave Collins and Leroy Stanton.
Bob Stinson is behind the plate and
Joe Lis and Tommy Smith will split

Pete Broberg, coming off a
disastrous year (1-7, 4.99), is the

FROM ARMCOON

  FINDING A JOB:

Environmentalism
—will it muddy
the job pool?

Some people think America will have
to spend a trillion dollars by the mid-

. 19805 on more pollution control. Could

this hurt your chance of getting a job
you want? We hope not-—but it’s a
possibility.

America simply doesn’t have a
trillion dollars to spare. Shifting so vast
an amount from other uses will disrupt
nearly every other national goal. ,

Adding costly environmental
equipmenl doesn't increase industrial
production. So once the equipment is
in place, the handful of new jobs
created for pollution control is more
than offset by production jobs that
don’t appear. Spending large sums" on
pollution control means companies
can’t spend that money on something
else——like new jobs.

We’re going to need another
18,000,000 jobs in this country by 1985.
These days the average job costs
$42,168 to create. So a trillion dollars
is more than the total current cost of
creating 18,000,000 jobs.

Even if we had a trillion dollars,
America couldn’t satisfy its most
extreme environmental demands
already on the books. Air quality rules
now lock important areas of the coun-
try out of any new industrial develop-
ment. And water quality standards
being applied to all bodies of water, no
matter'how they’r_e used. will stymie

getting cleaner lately. We’ve obviously
still got a lot to do. But as we do it,

we need to study carefully the costs and
benefits, to keep environmentalism
from tying America up in knots.

Plain tcilk about
POU.UTlON CONTROL

So far, Armco has spent $260,000,000
for pollution control systems. Running
that equipment costs us another
$26,000,000 a year. We’ve slashed our
air emissions 95%. But now we’ve
passed the point of diminishing returns.
Cutting into that final 5% can cost
more—and waste more electrical
energy—than it took to stop the entire
95%. What’s worse, generating the
electricity to reduce industrial emis-
sions further often creates more
pollution at power plants than industry
removes. As a nation, we need to
carefully examine environmentalist
demands and balance them against
their social, as well as economic,
consequences. _

Next time somebody says industry
ought to start cleaning up its act, you
might like to point out that the clean-
up is well on its way. The more extra
environmental costs pile on, the fewer
new jobs there may be.
