Mark Nordenberg began
his term as Pitt’s new chancel-
lor with a standing ovation at
the Board of Trustees meeting
that voted him in on June 20.
Nordenberg has been serving
as interim chancellor since
last August, following the res-
ignation of J. Dennis
O’Connor.

“I see the faces of some
people who have been friends
and colleagues for almost 20
years,” Nordenberg said in
accepting the position. “I do
treasure the relationships that I
hope will develop with each
and every one of you
[Trustees]. I pledge that I will
work to the full extent of my
ability and energy to fulﬁll the
responsibilities [of chancel-
lor].”

Nordenberg’s new salary
has not yet been detennined,

but he said that he and his
family hope to move into the
chancellor’s residence some-
time this summer.

The search committee for-
warded Nordenberg’s name to
J. W. Connolly, chairman of
the board, along with those of
Sherry Penney of the
University of Massachusetts
and Charles Reed of the State
University System of Florida.
The original list of candidates
generated by the committee
had approximately 160
names.

“I am absolutely delight-
ed,” said James,Holland, a
member of the senate execu-
tive committee who inter-
viewed the candidates. “I was
hoping for this for a long time,
and I think that we’re going to
be in for great progress at the
university.”

chancellor is awfully special
for me after working for the

said at a press conference after
the announcement.

Nordenberg came to Pitt’s
law school in 1977 and was
dean of the school from 1987
to 1993. He then served as
interim provost and senior
vice chancellor for academic
affairs. He returned to the law
school as a distinguished ser-
vice professor before becom-

best decision, seeing as he

. UPMC   colossus is not Piﬂ"s

I money for

Lisa McClendon
Senior Slaﬁ Writer

The relationship between Pitt
and UPMC is, for many students,
faculty, and staff, an unclear and
confusing one. The name “Pitt”
has been confused by many as the
owner of UPMC and a corporate

high roller that is buying and ,

joining numerous area hospitals.
This was evident in the recent
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette headline,‘
which read “Shadyside joins Pitt
colossus.” This colossus, howev-
er, is‘ not owned by Pitt.

“Pitt is struggling to try to get
academic
programs...Meanwhile, when you
pick up the newspaper, you find
out that the University of
Pittsburgh has acquired another
hospital,” said Jim Holland, psy-
chology professor and former
University Senate president.

“They haven’t really. It’s they
UPMC that acquired another hos- '

pital, but people can’t keep that
straight. They say, ‘They’re
spending billions and billions and
billions on hospitals. What are
they calling up asking me for
money for?’ In the public eye,
we’re real fat cats that manage to
get a new hospital every week.”
The health sciences committee
of the Board of Trustees sought to

clarify the relationship with a
report, which was distributed dur-
ing the Board of Trustees meeting
on June 20, after professor‘
Christina Paulston of the linguis-
tics department made a proposal

during a Senate Council meeting;

in April that the University of

Pittsburgh Medical Center not be .

allowed to use the title

‘University of Pittsburgh.’

Paulston said she didn’t think»; .»
beneficial t_o the '

University’s public image. She j .
noted the fact that UPMC is in the’ ~-

hospitals making university fund

Pitt students sell T-shirts to ﬁght increase in youth violence

Penelope Taylor
Staff Writer

In 1994, 31 children died of
gun violence in Allegheny
County, 24 of them from homi-
cide. Though the statistics show
only a marginal increase from
1993’s total of 21 homicides of
25 deaths, Pitt students and pro-
fessors are taking steps to help
children before they become vic-
tims. ‘

“Homicide is the leading
cause of death among youth
today in Pittsburgh,” said Ravi
Sharma, Ph.D., director of the
Graduate School of Public
Health’s program in Public and
Community Health Services.

As can be seen from the sta-
tistics at the right provided by

Sharma, deaths from gun vio-
lence, whether accident, homi- ~

cide, or suicide, are at high levels
in Allegheny county.

Five students from the pro-
gram, motivated by acts of vio-
lence in our own community,
decided to create a T—shirt and
attend the June 1, Stand for
Children march in Washington,

D.C. The T-shirts bear the words:
“In memory of all children who
have died as a result of vio-
lence.’’

So far, 800 T-shirts have been
sold at. $12 each. Seventy-five
percent of the proceeds from T-
shirt sales are going to the St.
Paul Outreach Center in
Beltzhoover, and 25 percent will
go to the Children’s Defense
Fund.

“T-shirt sales have amazed us,
and we are encouraged not only

by the monies we have raised,
but also by the tremendous desire
for local people to be part of this
national effort to stand for chil-
dren,” said Lynn-Marie Weber,
one of’ the participating students.
“These students were chal-
lengedpby recent events of vio-
lence in Pittsburgh, and course
work on violence and racism
prompted them to take action,”
saidDonald Mattison, M.D.,
dean‘ of GSPH. “Linking with
Pittsburgh’s massive response to

the June 1 rally is a perfect way
to raise funds and highlight their
concerns.”

The public health standpoint
is based on epidemiology, and by
this definition, gun violence is
the chief hazard for children and
youths in Allegheny County.

Michael Shankle, another of
Sharma’s students, told The Pitt
News that approximately 3,000
people from the Western
Pennsylvania region attended the
Stand for Children rally. The
main thrust of the rally was that
much legislation ignores and
harms the interests of children.

Despite negative coverage of
the rally in some local newspa-
pers, charging that it was based
on thinly disguised liberal politi-
cal interests attempting to redi-
vert funds into social programs,
Shankle stated that he and his
colleagues had no agenda other
than literally standing for chil-
dren and remembering that “chil-
dren are the future, and we need
to be aware of that.”

For further information about
the project or to purchase a T-
shirt, please call Lynn-Marie
Weber at (412) 681 5082.

Shooting suspectfs trial to begin

Cesea Antonelli
News Editor

The upcoming trial of a 15-year-
old boy highlights two growing trends
in Pennsylvania —— an increase in vio-
lent juvenile crime and an increase in
trying involved juveniles as adults.

Bruce Cabbagestalk, the teen
charged with shooting Kevin Cecil last
July, will be tried in Allegheny
Common Pleas Court beginning
Thursday, aftertwo delays. .

Cabbagestalk was ruled an adult in
September and is charged with attempt-
ed murder, aggravated assault, robbery,
conspiracy, and violation of uniformed
ﬁrearm laws. _

According to the Kids Count Data
Book which measures child welfare in
each state and the District of Columbia,
Cabbagestalk is only one of many.

Each year, Kids Count uses 10 sets
of statistics to measure child well-being
and ranks the 50 states and D.C. against
one another. The book rates
Pemrsylvania 23rd this year, a ranking
three places lower than last year.

Juvenile violent crime was
Pennsylvania’s worst category; it
ranked 39——-better than only 11 states
and D.C. In 1994, there were 24 gun-
related homicides by juveniles in
Allegheny County alone.

This year’s Kids Count book used
data from 1993, the most recent year
with numbers available in all cate-
gories, and was released for its ninth
year by the Anne E. Casey Foundation.

If found guilty, Cabbagestalk will
be included in the book to be released
in 1998.

In the past ﬁve years, the number
of teens tried as adults has more than
tripled. Last year, 20 juveniles were

tried as adults for violent crimes, com-
pared with only six in 1990, according
to the district attomey’s records depart-
ment. And, after the State Legislature
passed a law this year making it easier
to try violent juveniles in criminal
court, that number is expected to rise
sharply.

Cabbagestalk was one of three
people originally arrested in August,
after three students wrote letters to local
papers asking people not to forget
Kevin Cecil. The charges against the
other two arrested, a 17-year-old sus-
pect and Robert Bledsoe, 20, of North
Side, were withdrawn due to lack of
evidence. ‘

“You can’t use someone else’s con-
fession to convict another person,”
Assistant District Attorney Christopher
Connors said “There would have to be
some kind of new evidence [in order to
ever try the other two suspects].”

Cabbagestalk is contesting the con-
fession he gave to police after his arrest,
leaving no evidence‘ at all againstthe
other two suspects. _ ,

Connors said that the maximum
sentence Cabbagestalk could receive is
2 terms of 37 years. But Connors said
that if Cabbagestalk is found guilty, he
would expect the sentence to be “much
less” than that.

saying, “To maximize our institutional impact,
we must: one, assemble a senior administrative
team that is capable, creative, and committed
to the university and its academic mission;
two, work tirelessly to ensure that the institu-
tion is well managed, committed to excellence,
and moving forward; three, move aggressively
to identify and seize opportunities to increase
our efﬁciency and cost—effectiVeness; four,
generate the resources — through govemmen-
tal relations, private fund-raising, and the
development of alternative funding streams —
that will be required for us to achieve our full
potential; and ﬁve, partner effectively with
government leaders, citizen groups, and other
institutions to enhance the strength of out
home communities.”

Many officials feel that fund-raising
should be the ﬁrst priority of the new chancel-
lor. During the press conference, Nordenberg
cited two major challenges facing him in that
area. First, he stressed the need to “maintain
the momentum of the recent past.” Second,
N ordenberg said- that he would need to adapt to
an environment that would ask him to do more
with less.

To encourage more people to invest in Pitt,

N ordenberg sees three revenue enhancement
opportunities. The first is in the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Nordenberg
feels that Governor Ridge wants to invest in
higher education. The second avenue is private
fund-raising. The third is what Nordenberg
called “technology-transfer,” which he sees as
uniting the region economically, including Pitt.

At the Board of Trustees meeting which
elected Nordenberg, the trustees also voted to
look at alternatives to having students, faculty,
and staff on their committees, a proposal
which ﬁrst came out during a Senate Council
meeting and has since stirred up much contro-
versy. .
When asked about the resolution by The
Pitt News during the press conference,
Nordenberg stressed that the committee struc-
ture which has existed is still in place.

“[This resolution] authorizes a special
committee to look at other alternatives,”
Nordenberg said.

If the committee membership is limited to
trustees, Nordenberg would be the only vehicle
for students, faculty, and staﬁ to have a voice
in trustee affairs. Nordenberg said that, should
that be the case, he would need “good working
sessions with student governance groups.”

Pitt HIV Early Intervention Project teaches safety

Lisa McCIendon
Senior Staff Writer

As I walked into the
small office of the
Pittsburgh AIDS Center
for Treatment (PACT), I
was nervous. AIDS
Awareness paraphernalia
hung on a huge bulletin on
the far wall. It was a
strange feeling because I
wasn’t worried or afraid. I
knew the result of my HIV
test would be negative, but
the intensity of the testing
ritual was tremendous.

PACT is a part of the
Pitt HIV Early
Intervention Project, which
UPMC began approxi-
mately one year ago. At
PACT, people are educated
about HIV infection and
AIDS. People can come in
and get HIV counseling
and testing.

“As far as the testing
part, we like to schedule
an appointment, because
we spend some time doing
the pre-test counseling,”
said Burnell Sims, the
Outreach Nurse Educator
for PACT. “[The pre-test
counseling consists of]
actually identifying what
knowledge the client has
of HIV and AIDS, and
[discussing] what issues
they may have.”

. Pennsylvania

The project is funded
through a federal grant
under the Ryan White
CARE Act of 1990 in
order to fund health care
and support services for
people with HIV.

“I offer confidential
and anonymous testing,
then after [people] come
back for the results and the
post-test counseling,” Sims
said, “We’ll review the
results, and talk about the
initial risk reduction plan
that the person has person-
alized for the future that
[will] reduce their risk fac-
tor.”

I thought it would be
simple, but it wasn’t. She
wanted to know how I felt,
what I knew, and more
importantly, whether I
understood the information
about HIV and AIDS.

“It’s just not gettingea
test and that’s it, because
testing is one part of it,”
Sims said. “What we’re
finding now, with the
Health
Department in affiliation
with the mission statement
of the CDC (Center for
Disease Control), is" that
we want to modify behav-
ior. [Therefore], we don’t
want to just test people.
That’s not the outcome
[because] they can get test-

It is estimated by the
year 2000, everyone in
America will personally
know someone who has
died of AIDS or someone
who has HIV, the virus that
causes AIDS, according to
the HIV Early Intervention
Services pamphlet.

During my counseling,
I found

She placed a sticker on the

UPMC

0 from page 4

Hospital’s parent corpora-
tion (then known as
Presbyterian University
Hospital Systems, Inc. or
PUHSI) consent to use the
term “University of
Pittsburgh Medical Center
System” (UPMCS).

“[Essentially,] we have
two UPMC’s: one that’s
grouped in the university
but has a management
contract with the hospi-
tals, and the other, which
is the hospitals them-
selves. The hospitals
themselves are not part of
the university,” Holland
said. “Are you confused
yet?”

The complexity of the
relationship between the
university and UPMCS
has generated confusion
among many in the uni-
versity community and the
general public. Part of this
confusion stems from the
use of the term
‘University of Pittsburgh
Medical Center,’ accord-
ing to the Health Sciences
Committee report.

“When it’s in the inter-
est of the UPMCS to
declare itself totally inde-
pendent, they do so,”
Holland said. “When its in
the interest of them to be a
part of the University,
they can manage to pull

that off by just the-confu-  ..
sion as to what UPMC“

your talking about.”

UPMCS has no plans  A
or desire to relinquish the '

prefix “University of
Pittsburgh” from its name,

‘according to Jane Duffield

of the
bureau.

“We’re pleased with
our relationship with the
University,” said Duffield.
“Basically, the UPMCS is
run by a board of directors
and there is university
representation on that
board of directors. The
various schools of the
health sciences are, of
course, directly under the
University, and we find
that our very close rela-
tionship with the
University of Pittsburgh is
a mutually beneficial and
very productive.”

So why did Pitt give
Presbyterian Hospital use
of its name?

“They’re distinct legal
entities,” Fisher said. “We
granted the hospital per-
mission to use the name
for their marketing, PR —
however they wanted to
use it. And [this] provides
benefits both to the hospi-
tal and to the university.
When they do a transplant,
it says ‘University of
Pittsburgh Medical Center
System,’ and it gets our
name in the national [eye],
so it’s been a beneficial

two entities.”

  Opinions / Editorial

Advice from student voices

Now that the waiting is over and the envelope opened,
Mark Nordenberg has a line of people waiting to advise him in
all aspects of the operations of Pitt. Naturally, as the voice of the
students, The Pitt News will take this opportunity to share our
thoughts.

Pitt exists primarily to educate students. These students
are a diverse group who come from an entire range of the demo-
graphic spectrum. Oftentimes, the rewards which research brings
cause professors and administrators to lose sight of the most
important function of the university, and that is to teach.

Teaching students has its own rewards. Good students go
on to become quality researchers and professionals in their
ﬁelds. Some of them are bound to come back to their home insti-
tutions, if they are well treated.

Treating students well goes beyond the classroom. The
students are the backbone of the institution, and as such they
must bear the brunt of all that happens on campus and in the
community. Hence, quality of life issues are important. As the
Chief Executive Ofﬁcer of the University of Pittsburgh, the
chancellor is in the important position of overseeing all aspects
of campus life. ‘

This is why we need a chancellor who will take some
time to occasionally poke around in the cafeterias, the libraries,
the laboratories, and the dorms and will ﬁnd out what atmos-
phere the students are breathing.

Take care to see that the students aren’t getting robbed in
the bookstore or by the food service folks. Let the students have
a campus by ﬁghting for the closing of Bigelow Boulevard.
Finally, give the students a voice with the Board of Trustees, a

. direct, open line of communication.

At the same time, the commitment to excellence must be
maintained — speciﬁcally, the sports and academic programs.
There are small departments with outstanding faculty and pro-
grams which go largely unnoticed on and off this campus. These
people need to be recognized for their attainments, even if they
are scholarly as opposed to professional or scientiﬁc.

The sports programs must also make a commitment to
excellence. We must either do the job right or get out of the busi-
ness. If academic departments that lag in either enrollment or
quality can be cut, then the sports programs lacking in ability
should face the same ultimatum. In other words, the sports pro-
grams should be told “tum those win-loss records around, or we
shut down the teams.” «

These suggestions are just a start; there are many con-
cerns for a new chancellor to address. The key point to keep in
mind is that the decisions made ought to take in consideration

A hero ain't just Cl sandwich

Stephen
H. Segal

I want to talk
about heroes. . ‘

So do I. Batman sucks! The Hulk
rocks!

Ahem. Please excuse Stupid
Fanboy. Occasionally he manages to
get out of the basement. Comic book
heroes aren’t the point — what I’m
trying to say goes a lot deeper than
that. And it starts a lot higher — on
the 35th ﬂoor ofthe Cathedral, actual-
ly. ,

Every year, the University
Honors College (which is on the 35th
ﬂoor — if it can’t have an ivory
tower, it will settle for a concrete one)
sends about a dozen academic schol-
arship students off into the mountains
to a secret bunker, where they’re
trainedtokill with their bare hands.In
between aikido and swordﬁghting
lessons, they’re also encouraged to
have the occasional intellectual dis-
cussion or two.

During these discussions, the
topic of heroes invariably arises.
Questions are bandied about such as:
Who is your personal hero? What is a
hero? Why do some people call long
sandwiches heroes? And, by the way,
what time is lunch?

Some people claim that they
don’t have a hero — that blindly look-
ing up to another person as a near-god
is a dangerous practice. Other people
— many ofwhom are my roommate,
Ben — claim to be near-gods them-
selves. But the thing is, it’s possible to
consider several people to be your
-heroes, without thinking them perfect.

For example, one of my greatest

‘heroes is the late science ﬁction writer

Isaac Asimov. I think old Isaac was
the best for several reasons:

1. He grew the most immense
sideburns known to man.

2. He was Jewish, he didn’t
believe in God, and he saw no contra-
diction in this.

3. He read lots and lots and lots
of books.

4. In between #1 and #3, he
somehow found time to write 400
books of his own.

But I don’t think Isaac was per-

fect. For one thing, he had a neurotic
fear of ﬂying in airplanes, despite hav-
ing written dozens of novels about
people happily ﬂying across the uni-
verse in spaceships — go ﬁgure. For
another thing, he grew the most
immense sidebums known to man.

I was lucky enough to run into
Dr. Asimov about a year before his
deathin1992,andifyout1ytodraw
any conclusions from that, I’ll ﬁnd
you and hurt you. It is to my eternal

‘regret that I was too awestruck at the

time to say much of anything to my
hero — but my father was there, and
said, “Dr. Asimov, my son wants to
be a writer too.” Isaac just sighed,
shook his head, and said, “Ifhe wants
the life...” Words of wisdom indeed;
I’m lousy with deadlines.

_ After missing the opportunity to
express myself properly to Isaac, I
swore that such a thing would never
happen again. So I began to systernat—
ically hunt down my heroes in their
homes and — no, just kidding. But
last week, when I once again had the
chance to meet someone I consider a
liero,I made sure that I didn’t blow it.

Perhaps you may have noticed
the occasional reference in my writ-
ings to a certain musical ensemble
from Philadelphia known as The
Hooters. (I certainly hope you have,
since I’ve been shamelessly plugging
them every chance I’ve gotten.) The
songwriters of the group are Eric
Bazilian and Rob Hyman, who are
also responsible for much of the
music on the debut albums of both
Cyndi Lauper and Joan Osborne. Eric
and Rob write beautiful songs, songs
that grab your heart, soul, and feet all
at the same time and set them moving.

My roommate will tell you thatl
worship Eric and Rob as gods. It’s not
true. I admire their musical talent
greatly —very greatly — and whenl
dabble in songwriting myself, I try to
produce something worthy of their
standards, completely aburdly impos-
sible though that is. But I don’t think
they’re gods. Having said that, I must
adrnitthatiftheyweretoaskrneasa
personal favor to strip naked and um
through downtown Pittsburgh at 2
am., I’d probably ask if they’d prefer
me to take Forbes or Fifth.

Inanycase — lastSat11rday,two
of the other Hooters, Fran and Mindy,
were playing their solo material at a

bar in Philly, so my girlfriend and I

. made a little road trip. Before the

show started, I walked up to the stage,
tripped over a chair and fell on my
face. Then I stood up and said hi to
Franand Mindy, and we chatted fora
while, which was most excellent in
and of itself. .

The show started, the music was
great, I was having a blast. And then
right before intermission, the door
opened and in wandered Eric himself.
(Cue heavenly choir.) The band ﬁn-
ishedtl1eirsetandtookabr'eak,ar1d
my girlfriend said to me, “I don’t
believe it. You’ve innundated me with
the Hooters so much that I recognized
Eric ﬁomthebackofhishead.Gosay
hello before I get really annoyed about
this.” '

So I headed on over to the bar
and said, “Eric?” He tumedand said,
“Yeah?” I stuck out my hand and
said, “Hi, I’m Steve Segal.” He
grinned and said, “Steve! Hey, you
made it to the show!” and shook my
hand. (Bliss. Oh, did I mention that I
run the Hooters World Wide Web
page? I was hoping it would pay off
someday, somehow. Looks like I was
right — as it turns out, Eric’s a real
Internet lover.)

We talked for a couple of min-
utes, during which time I made sure to
express my gratitude and admiration
in a more coherent fashion than the
mouth—hanging-open noises I pro-
duced upon meeting Isaac Asimov.
And when I thought I had reached the
limit of my ability to be calm and col-
lected,I said, “Well, I have to go hang
out with my girlfriend now,” and Eric
said, “Yeah, I have to go hang out
with my wife now.” And that was
that.

So now that I’ve actually inter-
acted on a personal, equal level with
one ofmy heroes,Irealizethatit’s a
much better thing to have heroes who

arejust regular people at heart. It leads _

to a more optimistic viewpoint —-
hey, if he could become_ that great,
maybe I could too!

Um...my girlfriend and my

' roommate are both laughing at me.

Why are they doing that?

Steve Segal is the graphics editor
of The Pitt News, and hopes that

someday the Hooters will let him

direct a music video.

A ’smooth jazz’ fan admits to being a musical heretic

 

Rick
N owlin

Hate “smooth jazz”?

Angry with Secret Communications
for putting “The Revolution” out of busi-
ness? - '

If so, stop reading now.

I say that because Pittsburgh now has
a station that now plays the type of music
I’ve listened to almost exclusively for 12

_, years¢——_,ant_,l I couldnjt be happier. And I ,

intend to tell you about it, too.

It’s been known atdifferent times as
“fusion,” “contemporary jazz,” “lite jazz,”
and even “quiet storm” (a term coined by
a disc jockey in Washington, D. C. a few
years ago). However, for the most part,
those of us who preferred that amalgam of
jazz, rock, funk, and pop had to rely on
speciﬁc radio shows, usually on pop sta-
tions, to hear it. No station here in
Pittsburgh played it on a regular basis.

Until June. ‘

Anyway, my interest in “smooth jazz”

comes honestly. As my late father was a
fairly well-known local jazz musician, I
heard a lot of themusic growing up.
However, I got bored with the format
rather quickly —— play the “head” (theme),
soloists improvise over the chord changes,
do “fours” to get the drummer involved,
perhaps play a shout, then do the head
again to ﬁnish the tune. In my early teens I
started listening to Top 40 and progressive
rock — much to Dad’s chagrin — but the
pop bands wrote their own tunes, which I
liked. When the fusion movement started
in my late teens,,it struck a chord with me,
and I left the Top 40 for good in 1984.
And the truth is, “smooth jazz” is
harder to play than more traditional jazz.
More than once I’ve attended traditional
jam sessions where I played a tune I really
didn’t know, and I felt I was cheating. You
can’t fake it with smooth jazz; as it tends
to be more tightly arranged; you have to
know what you’re playing from the outset,
and you have to rehearse beforehand.
According to an article in Newsweek
last month, the so-called “smooth-jazz”
revolution (no pun intended) began in
1987 with KTWV, a radio station in Los

Angeles known as “The Wave.”

Supposedly some marketing ﬁrm “creat-
ed” the concept of sax-led songs backed
by guitars and synthesizers in response to
listeners’ preferences. As it is, according
to that article, “The Wave” is now the
highest—rated English-language station in
L. A., and the “smooth—jazz” stations in
New York and Chicago also top the

charts.

However, most people don’t realize
that the music itself has quite a history,
going back to the late 1960s. Mainstream
jazz musicians such as,Miles Davis,
Ramsey Lewis (whose drummer Maurice
White left to start Earth, Wind & Fire),
and Herbie Mann began to borrow from
rock and R&B to generate a whole new
sound. Other innovation-minded jazzmen
would follow in the ‘70s, such as key-
boardists and Davis-disciples Herbie
Hancock and Chick Corea, high-ﬂying
trumpeter and bandleader Maynard
Ferguson, and British guitarist John
McLaughlin. _

During this time, a whole new crop of
musicians, many of them from the New
York and Los Angeles studios (and thus
playing much more than jazz), made their

a mark by forsaking straight-ahead jazz

altogether. These include Tom Scott
(whose sax solos you can hear on Carole

King’s .“Jazzman,” Steely Dan’s ‘.fBlackJ

Cow,” and Blondie’s “Rapture”); David
Sanborn (who wailed behind David
Bowie during “Young Americans”) and
Randy and Mike Brecker, who made up
two-thirds of the horn section on Todd
Rundgren’s “Hello It’s Me.”

Not only that, but artists such as gui-

‘tarist Lee Ritenour, keyboardists Deodato,

Bob J ames-, and Patrice Rushen, ﬂugelhor-

L nist Chuck Mangione, vocalist Al J arreau,
"saxman Grover Washington Jr., and the

sax-led Buffalo—based band Spyro Gyra
not only set the jazz world on its ear, but

9

even managed to cross over into Top 40!
And in fact, by the 1980s, “fusion” (as
it was ‘still called then) dominated the jazz
world, at least as far as sales -— and its
biggest young stars— were concerned.
The Pacific Northwest in particular
exported a bit of keyboard talent, such as
Dan Siege], Tom Grant, and Jeff Lorber
(who at one time had a saxophonist in his
employ we now know as Kenny G).
Things changed in the early ‘80s
when trumpeter Wynton Marsalis came on
the scene. Jazz critics loved him and the
so-called “young lions” because they
didn’t play fusion. (1 have no idea why —
none of these guys did anything new).
And smooth jazz has always had its share

of detractors; pianist Ellis Marsalis,’

Wynton’s father, was quoted in the

Newsweek articleas referring to it as “a”

hooker with an evening gown.” I was a lit-
tle concerned - was “contemporary jazz”
dying?  
-Fortunately, no. —» ..~ . a -- — = :»  ~
Because, God willing, the irmovations
will continue. Veteran trombonist J {J .

Johnson said in an interview eight years -

ago in downbeat, “I don’t put down
[those] guys...they’re just expanding’ to

boundaries of jazz the way we used to.”' ‘

Sounds good to me.

Another of the musicians interviewed
in the Newsweek article said that he con-
sidered jazz a religion.

If that’s the case, call me a heretic.

ne night, I  shooting
_ all with my next door
neighbor on an oﬁ” night

during the NBA Finals between
the Chicago Bulls and Seattle
Super Sonics.

The custom while shooting
baskets is to converse (argue)
about the game. For a long time,
back in the late eighties, a day
wouldn’t go by without a ﬁght
over IU (Indiana) and Pitt bas-
ketball. Of course, as young
kids, there was only one reason
to defend a program that you
really didn’t know anything
about

Family Pride.

His father attended Pitt and
presently teaches at the universi-
ty. My sister traveled to
Bloomington, Indiana to a
nationally recognized business
school. For a little while, Pitt had
one hell of a rebounder who
broke backboards, and the team
had a shot at national prestige.
But an IU championship in 1987
led by Steve Alford and a shot
by Keith Smart ended any argu-
ment for a few years.

On this particular night, we
were talking about how much
we wanted to see Seattle corrre
back from the 3-0 deﬁcit and
shut up the Bull’s larger-than-life
attitude. My friends’ younger
brother was there listening to our
conversation. At one moment of
silence he piped in his say on the
matter.

"The Bulls are the best team
ever,” he said. I turned in sur-..
prise hearing this ﬁorn the same
kid who thought Val Kilrner was
the original Batman.

“Jordan, Rodman, and
Pippen are just too many good
players on one team to deny it,”
he said very quickly as I glared
at him

I immediately spit out the
combination of Bird, Parish, and
McHale as a better three, the
BIG three. My ﬁiend blurted out
the trio of Johnson, Kareem, and
Worthy with a bench that could
can'y itself against most teams of
that time period

lverson, Big East studs ready for the NBA

Matt Grove
Assistant Sports Editor

While most college stu-
dents are spending their sum-
mers working part- time jobs or
getting ready to ﬁnish up their
educations, a group of about
100 will be making their way to
New York’s Madison Square
Garden tonight for the NBA
Draft.

Of the Top 20 players in
this year’s draft, only seven
have fulfilled their four year
college commitments. Those
players are John Wallace,
Syracuse; Kerry Kittles,
Villanova; Steve Nash, Santa
Clara; Todd Fuller, N .C. State;
Walter McCarty, Kentucky; Roy

 

Rogers, Alabama; and Ryan
Minor of Oklahoma.

The last five number—one
picks have all been underclass—
men, and this year will most
likely be no different. The
Philadelphia 76ers make their
selection ﬁrst. The Sixers are in
desperate need of help at every
position, especially center, but

with the lack of quality big men.

in this year’s draft, Philly will
almost definitely pick a point
guard.

Georgetown’s Allen
Iverson is the top rated player in
the draft and unless someone
offers the 76ers a great deal,
they will likely take the 6—foot—1
guard with the ﬁrst pick.

Toronto general manager
Isiah Thomas has made it clear

Former Georgetown point guard Allen Iverson likely will be
selected first overall by the 76ers in tonight's NBA draft.

that he likes 7-foot-1 Marcus
Camby from UMass, but he has
also shown interest in
California’s Shareef Abdur—
Rahim who re-entered the draft
after backing out two weeks

The Vancouver Grizzlies,
like the 76ers, are in need of a
point guard, and Stephon
Marbury was the most sought
after pick, but he has told the
press that he doesn’t want to
play for the Grizzlies.
Considering this, the Grizzlies
may trade down in the lottery to
pick up another player and still
be able to draft Steve Nash, a
native of British Columbia and
a favorite north of the border.

Milwaukee owns the fourth
pick and is in need of a center to
take the load off of Glenn
Robinson and Vin Baker inside.
The Bucks may trade down and
still get a quality center later in
the lottery — perhaps Erick
Dampier of Mississippi State or
Zydruanas Ilgauskas of
Lithuania.

With the fifth pick, the
Minnesota Timberwolves like
Abdur-Rahirn of California but
really need a point guard.
General manager Kevin
McHale would like to get a
point guard and may have to
trade to get one. If no deal is
made, they may have to take the
best available player at that

point. Don’t look past Kittles or .

Antoine Walker of Kentucky.

The once-hallowed Boston
Celtics are on a downward spi-
ral and need a lift to get above
water and back into the play-
offs. They shipped disgruntled
center Eric Montross and the
ninth pick to Dallas for the sixth
pick. Look for Dampier or
Ilgauskas to go here.

Like most teams in the lot-
tery, the Clippers are in need of
everything. The word on the
street is that the Clips will use
the seventh pick to take the best
available power forward left,
most like1y‘Wa1lace or Walker.

VV1th John Calipari securely
in place as head coach, the Nets

can focus on rebuilding from .

scratch. Kittles would be a fan
favorite around the tri—state area
and would add some youth and
versatility to a group of slack-
ers.

The trouble in Dallas goes
further than who to take in the
draft. Jason Kidd and Jimmy
Jackson are feuding and look
for one of them to be traded on
draft day, most likely Jackson.
If Jackson is dealt away and
Ray Allen is still on the board,
he would ﬁt in nicely in Big D.

The 10th pick belongs to
Indiana. The Pacers need to re-
sign Reggie Miller or face
imminent death. Both Dale and
Antonio Davis are free agents,
so Indiana would be wise to
take a power forward — possi-
bly Lorenzen Wright of
Memphis or Louisville’s
Sarnaki Walker.

Rounding out the lottery are
the troubled Golden State
Warriors. Free agency could
hurt the Warriors this season as
Latrell Sprewell, Rony Seikaly,
and Kevin Willis could be head-
ed out. This will be the lowest
Kittles could fall, but if he isn’t
there, look for Nash to be taken
as the Warriors point guard of
the future.

As the draft wears on to the
middle and late ﬁrst round, the
talent drops off considerably.
Some of the players expected to
go in this area are N.C. State’s

and compare those teams against
the Bulls.”

So a few days ago, I found
myself at Carnegie Library on
Netscape, trying to defend my
position that the Bulls are not the
best team ever to play in the NBA.

My biggest argument against
Jordan was that he took way too
many shots. His high averages
were the product of shooting the
ball twice as much as other play-
ers. At least, I hoped so.

Bird shot the ball 17,334 times
in his 10-plus years. Jordan came
in at 16,051 with about the same
amount of playing time. Bird’s
overall percentage at .496 is lower
than Jordan’s .502. Bird’s largest
advantages over Jordan are in
assists, ﬁeethrows, and rebounds.

Rebounds!

Feeling slightly irritated, I
tried my best to harp the alleged
rebounding king, Dennis Rodman.

Once again, I found myself
amazed reading about how
Rodman is the only Bull to dili-
gently watch tapes of opposing
shooters. He studies the arc of the
ball and also memorizes where the
ball will most likely bounce after
hitting the rim. He spent the begin-
ning of his tenure at Chicago

rebounding shot after shot ﬁom
Jordan and Pippen. Now the man
can accurately predict where the
missed shot will fall. If Dennis
Rodman didn’t have tatoos, ear-
ings, and kooky hair, it would be
interesting to see how much more
acclaim he would receive from his
critics.

At least in coaching, I could
turn to Pat Riley, former Laker
coach who lead Los Angeles to
four world championships. But
Phil Jackson now has four rings of
his own and a mysterious coaching
philosophy.

Jackson gives each player a
book to read at the beginning of
the season and teaches meditation
between defensive drills. I won-
dered how anyone could coach a
team with the world’s greatest
player, possible greatest swing-
man, and the newly annointed
rebounding champ. Only a man
who has his office filled with
Indian artifacts and avidly listens to
the Grateful Dead could keep
together such a rowdy bunch
relaxed and focused on the season.

By now, I was nmning out of

Draft

from page 10

Todd Fuller, Roy Rogers of
Alabama, 6-foot-10, 290 pound
Vitaly Potapenko of Wright
State and Ronnie Henderson of
LSU. Joining them will likely
be a pair of high schoolers skip-
ping college and heading for the
pros in Kobe Bryant of Lower
Merion, Pa. and Jermaine
O’Neal of Eau Claire, S.C.

The New York Knicks, a
team that has been a perennial
contender in the East, can turn
things around with their three
first round picks (18, 19 and
21). New York will likely make
some trades and dabble in the
free—agent market, especially in
the Reggie Mﬂler sweepstakes.
The Knicks must realize that
Patrick Ewing isn’t going to be
around forever and should look
for a future center. Georgetown
alums Jerome Williams or
Othello Harrington could carry
on the Hoya tradition Ewing
began.

One prospect who didn’t
make much noise as a reserve at
Williams College but has
caused scouts to take a second
look has been Eric Gingold.
Standing 7-foot-4 and weighing
290 pounds, how couldn’t you
cause anyone take a second
look? Gingold impressed NBA
scouts with a great performance
at the camp June 4-7 in
Chicago. Many scouts believe
that he could turn out to be the
battling partner of Shaquille
O’Neal down the line, .-but oth-
ers see him as the next Chuck.
Either way, he seems to be a
decent gamble late in the ﬁrst or
early in the second round.

Trainspotting the pop life of
Irvine Welsh “Trainspotting”.

W.W. Norton & Co.

Obsessed with Acid
House music, illicit drugs,
and British pop culture in
general, from both a literary
and personal point of view,
Irvine Welsh has quickly
risen from a boring London
nine—to-fiver to the William
Wallace of Scots junk-lit
rebels. Already a play and a
major motion picture,
“Trainspotting”, Welsh’s
first novel, proved him to
be an instant success with

-«critics, readers, and, most

importantly, non-readers.

“Trainspotting”’s 40+
short snapshots of
Edinburgh housing project
life provide a reference
point for the poorly tattooed
football (that’s soccer to
you) hooligans in Old
Reekie and around Britain,
people who’d rather read
Oasis lyric sheets than
Seamus Heaney, “fuckin’
old radge” that he is. To say
that Welsh has tapped into a
vein in Brit culture would
be a sick metaphor, yet it
would be so true.

The strength of the
novel comes in many forms.
First, and most important-
ly,is Welsh’s‘sense of the
humour of the Scottish
dialect. He writesin the
Edinburgh slang that we’ve
previously seen only in the
antiquated Robert Burns,
whose genius for drink and
word has obviously, per-
haps unavoidably, influ-
enced Welsh. The words

flow out in a Beat rush, a
tartan Rave Kerouac with-
out much pretension, craft-
ing a gourmet meal of
obscenities from the tat-
tered lives of the lowest
junky scum that Scotland
has to offer. The tales he
tells are sad and hopeless,
yet they become hilarious
in the rude—boy’s hands.
Take for instance “The First»
Day of the Edinburgh
Festival”, in which an
addict trying to kick junk
loses an important “medi-
cine” in the overflowing
porcelain of a betting shop,
providing one of the best
descriptions of junk-lust to
date: “Locating the other
takes several long dredges
through the mess and the
panhandling of the shite ay

many good Muirhoose and.

Pilton punters. Ah gag
once, but get ma white
nugget ay gold, surprisingly
even better preserved than
the first.”

In the tradition of his
spiritual forefather, Scottish
emigrant and professional
hedonist Alexander Trocchi
(read his brilliant novel
“Cain’s Book”, if you get
the chance), Welsh
describes his main subject,
drug use, as a central part
of life, neither damning nor
condoning it, simply show-
ing what it is like. With
heroin experimentation at
an all-time world high and a
plethora of bad junk-lit
coming out at the moment,
it’s good to see someone
who knows both what he’s

talking about and how to
talk about it. Like a
Hemingway of hell, the sly
radge Irvine can talk, and
talk, and talk, and maybe
even listen a wee bit.
Beyond just drugs, the
author has developed a set
of characterswho show us
the ragged underbelly of
Scottish life: fighting over
football, a thin cover for
political struggle, the scary
world of ‘90s sex (especial-
ly in a needle sharing envi-
ronment), the hopelessness
of the very- poor; most of
the traditional British work-
ing class literature topics
exemplified by novels like
Alan Sillitoe’s “Saturday
Night and Sunday Morning”
are squeezed through a
thick Wideboy accent into

More than a writer,
Irvine Welsh is a pop star,
cavorting with Brit bands,
getting arrested for his...

umm... overzealous support’

of Scottish football teams,
and getting his‘ face plas-
tered across the music
press. Like a literary ver-
sion of _ Hunter S.
Thompson, he takes the
offense in interviews, drag-
ging reporters to house
music all-nighters and forc-
ing Ecstasy into their
mouths before they turn on
the tape recorder. Perhaps it
is for these reasons that he,
along with his “Edinburgh
Beat” contemporaries (the
lesser known small press
fiends who have stormed
the British lit Bastille), are
the most important writers
in English right now. Welsh
recently had three books in
the Scottish “top ten” at
once, giving a shot in the
arm to the idea of (Jaysis!)
reading literature. Imagine
if Danielle Steele was beat-
en and kidnapped by Mark
Leyner or Martin Amis, and
American people started
reading for fun?

“Hey, yinz guys should
go dahntahn to the book-
store and get sumpin’ by dis
Joyce guy... You read
Joyce, Maandy?”

“Sure, o’course I read
dat dude... Wanna ‘nother
bottle 0’ Am?”

Revolution would be the
next logical step.

Trek on over to the Turmoil Room for art and noise

Storm and Stress with Paul Brainard and Randy Costanza

Since the demise of
Wilkinsburg’s Sonic
Temple right around the
Dawn of the 90’s, there
have been Very few places
local kids could gather on
their own terms for all—ages
musical events. Indie pro-
moter Manny Theiner has
been the only person to

' consistently book quality

national and local acts, at
basically any venue he can
get his mitts on. CMU’s
Skibo Coffeehouse was a
good spot before it was
demolished, and the Pitt

campus was once home to’

some damn good shows,
before the fascist overlords
decided to pull the plug on
live rock shows in universi-
ty buildings. That has left
Luciano’s and the occasion-
al Beehive gig as the last
bastions of all-ages music
events.

Similarly, the
Pittsburgh art world is most
often centered in the insu-
lar realm of South Side gal-
leries, with exceptions
being occasional exhibits at
the Garfield Artworks, or

_more “safe” spots like the

Pittsburgh Center for the

Arts.

Well, for at least a
decade now, the Turmoil
Room, located in Regent
Square, has been a great
spot for not-so-safe art and
music, and the time has
come once again for a
union of “degenerate art” to
take hold.

Be there this Saturday
June 29, when three local
artists showcase their
works, and at least three
great bands. make some
noise. Local comic geek-
hero Randy Costanza (cre-
ator of “Life Sucks”) will
show paintings and __draw—
ings (you may have seen
his work on flyers for vari-
ous AB concerts), Paul
Brainard will show paint-
ings, as will Frank
Santoro.

Music will be provided
by Pittsburgh_’s premiere
all-star avant-rock trio,
Storm and Stress, with
members of Don Caballero,
40 Stories, and Seven
Goats. The Iron City power
unit Six Horse (featuring
members of The Northern
Bushmen and Blunderbuss)
will rock the foundations of

the joint. ,
Special musical guests
of the evening will be
Dearborn, Michigan’s quar-
tet Windy and Carl, who
play in the ethereal rock

realm inhabited by long’

lost bands like Galaxy 500
and “Perfect Prescription”-
era Spacemen 3.
Comparisons with groups
ranging from Flying Saucer
Attack to the Cranes have
also been made.

All in all, it should be a
spectacular event, in a great
venue. People shouldn’t be
turned off just because the
show will take place out-
side of the Oakland area,
because it is surely worth
the trek. If local art and
great music aren’t enough
to entice anyone, you
should know that the
Turmoil Room is generally

a beverage-friendly spot, so "

bring your own.

The Turmoil Room is
located at" 704 South
Trenton Ave, near Regent
Square. It all goes down at
8 p.m. this Saturday, June
29.

groups to be her guests from 9-
11p.m. every week- Having
graduated and now California-
bound, Dernus left the local
show to station manager Paul
Williams and Adam Feinberg.
Supporting Indie Rock has been
a steadfast tradition at the station
since the local show began last
Fall.

Dernus (better known as
Amy Lou to her listeners) always
enjoyed traveling and working
with local musicians.
Recognizing WPTS’ live perfor-
mance potential, Dernus collabo-
rated with the station engineers
to set a stage for eager bands to
rock out on the radio. “I’ve
always had a deep desire to be a
performer, and I enjoy working
with radio,” says Dernus. The
laid-back format of the Indie
supported station allowed all dif-
ferent genre bands to participate
on Demus’ show. “It didn’t mat-
ter if you were low-fi or pro-
duced —— you were welcomed to
perform,” says Dernus. The
funky—groove of Blindsight
stands as Dernus’ favorite show.
The deep spirited licls of Lenny
and Dino inspired a small gyrat—
ing audience to form inside the
station. Good vibes are a depend-
able aspect of all the local acts
that appear on this past season’s
performances.

The June 12 performance of
Mace was Dernus’ last show.

industrial lust melodies. The
mysterious aura of the ﬁve band
members haunted the small
sound rooms as they set up their
equipment. Lead vocals Peter
Czyszanowski checked the
sound levels with an eery silence
that made Dernus and I wonder
if we were going to get an inter-
view at all. As it turns out,
Czyszanowski is from Poland

and shies away from media-

because of his European accent.

Mace’s metallic beat and
techno rythms intimidated me at
first. The dark personality that
lingers around the band is most
evident in their lyrics. With lines
like “Get down in the name of
pleasure”, “Gotta be naked and
stoned,” and “You look so excit-
ing my little whore”, Mace plays
up a strong sadomasochistic
image.

After I introduced myself
with a hint of schoolgirl timidity,
Mace coaxed me into the girls’
restroom. Surrounded by rever-
berating tile walls,
and crew
unstrapped some of their leather
faces to explain the seductive
illusions of their music.

Mike Patton
Adult Themes for Voice
Tzadik

Imperial Teen

' Seasick

Slash Records

For those of you out
there who have been waiting
for Faith No More to come
out with another album,
you’re going to have to wait
a bit longer. The execs say
that the band is laying down
tracks as we speak, but fall
would be the earliest that
we’d get to hear it. So, to_
tide over your Faith No More
fancies, there aretwo new
albums out from FNM mem-
bers. ‘

First up is Mike Patton
with his first solo release,

_ Adult Themes for Voice. For

those of you who don’t
know, Mike Patton is Faith
No More’s lead singer and
has done side projects with
Mr. Bungle and John Zorn.
No one ever said Mike
Patton was normal, and
Adult Themes for Voice is
an album designed to show
off Mike’s strange personali-
ty, as well as his vocal talent.

"Adult Themes for Voice
is not your regular rock
album. It is a collection of
34 short vocal themes,
almost all of which are less
than a minute long.
Basically, it. c.ons_i.sts_ of
Patton screaming, hollering,
whistling, grunting, and
blabbering into a micro-
phone.. Some of the noises
that come out are amazing.
It’s hard to believe this is
just a man and his micro-
phone. Some of the tracks
are a bit odd and hard on the
ears, but they come and go
before you even realize
they’ve been there.

Of course, this album
isn’t for everybody. In fact,
it’s for practically nobody
save die-hard Faith No More
completists and people out

for the unusual. Even if you
are a Faith No More fan,
there is no guarantee that
you will even find this album
palatable.

Now on to more “nor—
mal” stuff with Imperial
Teen’s debut release,
Seasick. Imperial Teen fea-
tures Faith No More key-
boardist Roddy Bottum, here
playing guitar and doing the
vocal duties. The album has
been a long time in the
works after the band had
trouble choosing a name.
They had been called Star 69
until a southern California
band of the same name
threatened legal action. So
they went with Imperial
Teen, and everything was
fine —~ until they found out a
band named Imperial Drag

had an album coming out the .

exact same week. Oh well,
you win some, you lose
some.

Anyway, the music of
Imperial‘ Teen is nothing like
Faith No More’s. It is proba-
bly the softest band ever to
be signed to the Slash record
label (the same label as
FNM). Sounding a lot like
Weezer or The Rentals,
Imperial Teen plays straight-
edge pop with a chippy
sound and distorted guitars.
And although the music may
be happy, the lyrics are not
the normal pop fare. There is
some deep social commen-
tary here on songs like
“Butch” and “You’re,One,”
but most people will like to

rock on wi.th_.the catchier

“Imperia1 Teen” or
“Luxury”.

Yet again, even if you
like Faith No More, there is
no reason to say that you
will definitely like Seasick.
However, Imperial Teen is a
bit more accessible to the
“alternative” crowd than
Patton’s Themes. It is at
least up to the caliber of
many of the more popular
alternative bands out there
and is definitely better than

Imperial Drag.
