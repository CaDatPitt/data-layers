Pittsburgh
accepting
gangs as
reality

By Bryan Bender

Perspective Editor

‘Pittsburgh, joining other
American cities, is in the grips of a

crisis where automatic weapons B

and the color of a bandana are
beginning to control the streets.

Youth violence connected to
gangs has risen at an alarming rate
in Pittsburgh and is sure to catch
up with gangs in other cities across
America if not stemmed, according
to Joseph A. Daugerdas, director of
court services for Allegheny
County.

“There are currently 55 operating
gangs in the county,” Daugerdas
said. Most of these are divisions
and subdivisions of the “Bloods”
and “Crips,” gangs whose counter-
parts can be found in cities like
Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland and
Los Angeles, among others. _

Daugerdas pointed to the fact

that 17 young men in the city this if

year have been victims of homi-
cide due to gang affiliation. There
has been a frightening increase in
firearms violations as well, 150 this
year alone, he said.

Sponsored by The Center for
Chemical Dependency Treatment
at St. Francis Medical Center, the
LaR‘oche College symposium
showcased Dr. Louis D. Gonzales,
a national speaker on violence
prevention in schools and commu-
nities. Participants included law
enforcement officials, school offi-
cials and teachers, health depart-
ment officials, probation officers

(Editor’s Note: This is tbe sec-
ond part of a two—part ser1‘e.s'.,)

AIDS and other sexually

diseases have
become an everyday part of
society. They have claimed the
lives of thousands and affected
millions. ’
, Sexual Aides wants to stop
the suffering by informing stu-
dents on how to protect them-
selves.

“We help people to learn how
to make responsible decisions
about sex,” Sexual Aides
Coordinator Dave I-Iornyak said.
“AIDS and STDs are often over-
looked by college students.
There is almost a sense of invin-
cibility.”

Sexual Aides is an interactive
sex education peer program

according to Hornyak. Its focus
is to provide facts about AIDS

McLaughlin said.

“There were a lot of good

Arrival of ﬂu season nears its way to campus

' Inﬂuenza (or ﬂu) is a conta-
gious viral infection of the respi-
ratory system. It can strike any
age group, but usuallyis more
severe in the elderly, young
children and persons with
chronic respiratory problems.
Most people are ill for only a
few days, but some people may
have a more serious illness and
may need to be hospitalized.
Unfortunately, many people die
each year in the United States
from ﬂu or ﬂu-related complica-
tions. No cases have been
reported to the Allegheny
County Health Department as of
Sept. 30.

The onset of inﬂuenza may
occur suddenly. The symptoms
include fever (can be quite
high), headache (can be
severe), muscle aches and ‘pains
(especially lower back and eye
muscles). A person may also
have chills, runny nose, stuffy
or congested ears, cough and
weakness.

There is no magical cure for
the ﬂu. It is a viral infection and
does not respond to treatment
with penicillin or other antibi-
otics. There are two antiviral

‘some of the

agents that tend to lessen the
severity of the disease in various
strains of influenza A.’ To be
effective these medications
should be started within the first
12 hours of onset of the flu.

(one teaspoon of salt mixed into
eight ounces of warm water)
every three or four hours may
make your throat feel better.

be immune. Each year the
Center for Disease Control
determines what strain is likely
to occur in the United States
and requests vaccines to be
made against those strains. The
vaccine will begin to ‘provide
protection after one or two
weeks.

Because inﬂuenza is usually
not life threatening in otherwise

healthy individuals, health offi— ‘

cials emphasize the use of the
vaccine for the elderly and peo-
ple with other health problems.
Students who have chronic
upper respiratory problems or
immunological _ disorders should
see a physician to get a pre-
scription fora ﬂu shot, which
the Allegheny County Health
Department will then give free
of charge.

Sex  

Continued from page 1
the bedroom. There is no such
thing as safe sex, there is safer
sex. By definition, sex is dan-
gerous.”

Two facilitators start the pro-
gram by encouraging the audi-
ence to shout out different
words used to describe sexual
intercourse. This “loosens up”
the students, Lewis said.

“When I came to college, I

found that people learn from

their friends many different
words instead of the word sex,”
facilitator Kimberly Butala
said.

“Society as a whole is not
comfortable with sex,” Lewis
said.

Then the audience is asked to
yell out why they think con-
doms aren’t used all the time.
The presenters then dispel each
“myth” one by one, according
to Butala. .

Most of the Sexual Aides pre-
sentation consists of disproving
several reasons repeatedly
cited.

Students often say that
condoms are embarrassing,
they break, they ruin the
mood, they are difficult to put
on in the dark and that sensa-
tions are lost when using a con-
dom. A

“Would you rather be preg-
nant or have some sort of STD,”
Butala answered to a student
that said buying condoms is
embarrassing. _

There are several short
demonstrations to disprove the
various reasons given, but one
in particular grabs the audience,
according to Butala.

When a student says‘ that con-

doms are difficult to put on in
the dark, this prompts a facilita-

tor to request a volunteer from
the audience.

According to Butala, the vol-
unteer is then ‘blindfolded and
given a piece of wood. But this
is no ordinary piece of wood,
this is “Woody.”

“Woody” is a piece of wood
carved into the shape of a man’s
penis. The blindfolded volun-
teer is given “Woody,” and
then asked to open a condom
package and put the condom
on it.

The volunteer’s technique is
then critiqued, and the class is
shown the proper way to put a
condom on.

“The condom demonstration
was great,” student Shana Salob
said.

“It’s kind of assumed that
when a person buys a condom
they know how to use it, but
that’s not always true.”

“This is not a lecture,” Butala
said. “I-L15 more audience
p€1I'[lClp21[l\OQ,=.,1WhlCl1 is fun.

‘ People tend td tune out of lec-

tures.”

According to I-Iornyak, the
program appears mostly at
Freshman Studies classes and
on floors in the residence halls,
but they would like to do pre-
sentations for more campus
organizations.

The program currently has
five students trained as facilita-
tors but is in the process of
training 17 others.

“You can tell these people
went through a tremendous
amount of training,” student
Steve Pickios said “They didn’t
miss a beat.”

Sexual Aides developed out
of the Office of Residence Life
and is also co-sponsored by the
Student Health Service.

THE PI'I;I‘ NEWS, Thursday, October 7, 1993

Gangs

Continued from page 1
and social workers from
Western Pennsylvania.

Participants focused on the
availability of illegal drugs and
firearms as major causes which
nurture this life of crime and
quick money.

James Allen, director of East
End Youth Outreach, said often-
times these youths have no
other options and have given
up on the idea of conventional
success.

Allen also asked for citizens
to support gun control.

Gang members are carrying
AK-47s and MAC-10s, both
semiautomatic weapons, and
are better armed than police
officers. “lThoughl some people
are still opposed to controlling

the sale of semiautomatic

weapons,” Allen said. ,
The glorification of violence

in our society is responsible for
some of these problems,
according to Allen.

“Kids I have worked with
could name 12 movies they saw
which glorified violence,” he
said.

But Pittsburgh Police
Narcotics Detective Damian
Wiles, an expert on street
gangs, said Pittsburgh’s violence
hasn’t reached the heights
of cities like Los Angeles
yet, and the city is fortunate
because it recognized it was
dealing with a problem much
sooner than other cities did in
the past.

A reoccurring theme through-
out yesterday’s program was
that people in Pittsburgh are still
in denial and find‘ it difficult to
face today’s harsh realities.

Gangs in Pittsburgh are rela-

tively new and consist of first »

generation members. Whereas
gangs like those depicted in the
film New jack City are often sec-
ond and third generation,
Gonzales said. “It’s nowhere
near as bad [in Pittsburghl,” he
said.

In leading the discussion,
Gonzales listed some “risk fac-
tors” which exist that force
many young people to look to
gangs.

Those include racism, the lack
of leisure activities for inner-city
youths, the lack of family—com-
munity partnerships, the lack of
equal educational opportunities
and poverty.

Many youths are drawn to
gangs for a sense of identity,
belonging, protection and
sometimes because of intimida-
tion, he said.

The media may be to blame.
“Television desensitizes chil—

antics.

Now she knows the
dynamics of life
insurance, too.

And her family couldn’t be happier. To learn more

dren to violence by the fourth
grade,” he said.

In many respects, according
to Gonzales, it is not the fault of
the youngsters but adults. “We
have seen the enemy, and it is
ourselves,” he added.

Gonzales identified the differ-
ent types of gangs, echoing the
remarks of others that all street
gangs don’t consist of only
African Americans.

He said he counts a total of 71
hate groups in America, includ-
ing white supremacist gangs
such as the neo-Nazi skinheads,
the Aryan Brotherhood and
Aryan Youth Movement, in
addition to Asian, Latino and
female gangs.

Females make up 10 percent
of all gangs around the country,
and their number is growing, he
said.

Formerly a high school
administrator in California,
Gonzales joked that every
morning he would check his
students for guns, and if they
didn’t have one, he would give
them one so they could protect
themselves.

Highlighted were the four
possible ways to get out of
a gang: death, life in prison,
clear—cut job training and place-
ment and salvation through reli-
gion.

Ways to detect gang members
are sometimes difficult partici-
pants agreed, outlining some of
the gang attire. For instance,

Bloods are known to wear all
red, including modiﬁed baseball
caps which are personalized
for the individual member and
their respective gang, as well as
bandanas, according to
Gonzales.

Another identifier of possible
gang members and territory is
graffiti. Gonzales related a story
which occurred in California
where “187 Babyface” was
spray painted throughout a
gang’s neighborhood. Law
enforcement officials finally ﬁg-
ured out that the number was a
penal code referring to homi-
cide. Gang member, nickname
“Babyface,” was murdered by a
rival gang.

A former member of the
Bloods spoke of the real friend-
ship and brotherhood that he
received from his gang. What
made him decide to turn away
from that way of life was the
love and caring displayed by
members of his family, some-
thing all too often missing in the
lives of many inner-city youth,
he said.

“If you test their hearts,
they’re going to lay down their
red [clothing] forever,” he said.
“All they need is someone to
look up to, someone to reach
out to them.”

The program was the first part
of a three-part series on youth
violence and its prevention,
spanning from Tuesday to
Thursday.

On Tuesday, Defense Secretary Les Aspin overruled
Navy Secretary John Dalton and decided to keep
Admiral Frank Kelso on as chief of NavalOperations.

According to The New Yorle Times, Mr. Dalton asked
for Adm. Kelso’s removal “because of a failure to show
proper leadership at the 1991 Tailhook Association
Convention in Las‘Vegas.”

This was the infamous case where 83 women were
forced to run the gauntlet among Navy men, while
being physically assaulted at the military conference.

The Navy then tried to cover up the situation, making it

more abominable. _ ,

Although Kelso was not connected to any actual
assault, Dalton based his decision on Naval tradition,
which says a commander is responsible for the action of
his sailors, because he Wasn’t aware of things he should
have known, including the fact that the Navy violated its
own rules by paying over $190,000 tokbring 1,500 offi-
cers to the Tailhook convention.

Kelso offered to resign in 1992, according to The New
Yorle, Times, for “the good of the Navy.” His resignation
was refused by former President Bush. However, the
Clinton administration should not only accept his offer
but request his removal.

Military responsibility_must begin at the top. The offi-
cers must lead their troops, maintain control and accept
the responsibility of their positions. This responsibility is
what makes the organization an effective entity. If com-
manding officers cannot be held responsible for the
actions of their troops, they have no incentive to main-
tain discipline. ’ '

It is interesting to wonder whether Keslo would be.
removed if he committed a military blunder instead of .
condoning sexual assault.

Defense Secretary Aspin overruled Dalton’s first major
decision as secretary of the Navy. He did this not to pre-
serve fairness, but to help President Clinton’ avoid mak-
ing his relationship with the military worse.

"President Clinton has already had conﬂicts with the
military over such’ issues as allowing homosexuals to
enlist. Not only must we have responsibility in the peo-
ple who control our resources, but we must maintain

- credibility.

‘ We are anation which has responvsibility as one of its

main -watchwords. If we treat our oiwn S€I'V1C€ men and

women poorly, and we do not make them own up for
their actions, we become little more than a larger ver-
sion of those nations.we condemn for violating civil
rights. * ' - l

Although Adm. Kelso has supported, greater opportu-
nities for women in the Navy, he should now show that
he is. concerned with protecting women’s rights as well.
He should accept responsibility for the actions of his
men and step down.

I felt compelled to write this article after. seeing
the “Stop The Genocide In Tibet” ﬂiers hanging
on walls around campus. I would like to take
exception to some of the “facts” stated on those
ﬂiers. -

Let me begin by first saying that Peking is not
conducting a policy of genocide in Tibet, nor
have they ever done so.‘

There can be no denying the fact that some
Tibetans have been killed in the numerous upris-
ings that have occurred since 1950, but it is
unsubstantiated to say that over one million have
been killed. 0 ‘ l

My second point of contention with that flier is
the statement that the .Dalai if

Tibet's culture not near extinction i

still, for the most part, poor, but that can be said
of many of China’s more economically-backward
provinces. It is certain that some things, such as
health care, have improve'd under Communist
rule.

And to say that Tibetan culture is on the brink
of extinction is just plain nonsense.

China has two major areas where'Tibetan cul-
ture is found in abundance —— Tibet and Qinghai
(where the present Dalai Lama was born). During
the past several years, the central g'overnment has
spent millions of yuan (the Chinese currency) on
restoring Buddhist monasteries in these areas.
Two years ago I fortunately had the opportunity

- ‘ ’ to visit one of China’s most

Lama was exiled from Tibet.

That statement is a fallacy.

In 1959 the Dalai Lama left
Tibet for India of his own free
will. Since 1959 the Chinese
government has on numerous
occasions asked the Dalai Lama

Dickensheets

famous Tibetan monasteries,
Taer Monastery, and it gave me
a great deal of respect for
Tibetan people and culture.

As one of China’s 55
minority groups, Tibetans have
special benefits and privileges

to return to Tibet.

There is substantial historical .
evidence to support the fact that Tibet is and has
been an integral part of the Chinese empire.
Economic, cultural and political ties go back to
the seventh century in the Tang dynasty.

During that time, Tibetan emissaries were sent
to the Tang court to present tributaries and to
apply for trade. During the Qing dynasty (1644-
1911), the Dalai Lama and Panchen sent their rep-
resentatives to Peking to ask the central govern-
ment for help in defeating the invading Gurkhas
of Nepal.

In 1791 the Emperor Qian Long sent forces and
expelled the invaders within a year. When the
incarnation of the Dalai Lama was found in the
Qinghai province in February, 1940., the central
government of the Kuomintang was asked for its
approval of and attendance at the ceremony
where the 14th (and current) Dalai Lama was
installed. ‘ '.

After the Communists came to power in 1949,
Tibet was made into a special autonomous region
and was recognized to be a part of China by the
Indian Prime Minister Nehru. .-

When one looks at the Tibet situation today it
must be looked at objectively-and rationally.

The fact is that the life of the average Tibetan
has improved as a result of the massive amounts
of money that the central government in Peking
has sent into Tibet.

There is no doubt that the people‘ of Tibet are

majoring in East Asian studies.

that go along with affirmative
action programs. '
Tibetan children have greater access to univer-
sity education because of a quota system that the
government has set up. Tibetan couples are also

g exempt from the “one—couple, one—child” policy.

The average size of a Tibetan family is 5.2 peo-
ple, which is the highest in China. The fact is that

Tibet is still one of China’s poorest provinces and .

could not possibly survive as an independent
nation. .

It would undoubtedly come under the influ-
ence of some Western nation who would have to
prop it up militarily and economically. Today
only 15 percent of people in_ Tibet live in urban
areas (Population Bulletin. June, 1992,), and a full
44.4 percent are still illiterate despite central gov-
ernment efforts to educate a large share of the
populace.

Tibetan people are not on the verge of extinc-
tion as is demonstrated by the fact that 96.3, per-
cent of the people in Tibet are minorities for
example non-Han Chinese (Poston et al, 1992).
The Tibetan culture and people should be
respected and preserved but should not be insti-
gated to seek independence by some ultranation-
alistic movement, because as events in
Yugoslavia and the former Soviet Union show,
countries that want"independence for only
nationalistic reasons are almost certain to fail.

Porter's
The Panthers get
back on track
at Pitt Stadium
Wlth'3-O shutout

Byjason Brame
Asst. Sports Editor

To say that yesterday was a

strange sports day is to make
an understatement equivalent

of saying that Mitch Williams is
kinda crazy;

Within hours of_ Michael
Jordan’s retirement from the
NBA and both the American

League -and National League

Championship Series under-J

_ way, the Pitt soccer team wit-

nessed what might be the most

difficult individual feat in soc—

cer.

The natural hat trick — three
goals for one player in one
half.

Jeff Porter, now Pitt’s leading
scorer, buried a trifecta of goals
in leading the Panthers to a 3-0
non—conference win over
Marshall.

“Hell yeah, [the hat trick] was
unbelievable,” Pitt forward Eric
[Duffy said. “That was so good
 the first hat trick since I’ve
been here [at Pittl.”_

Head coach Joe Luxbacher, a
former Panther» standout, was
equally amazed.

“That’s the first hat trick I can
remember in a long time here
at Pitt,” Luxbacher said.

“It was alright, I guess, but I
got so many chances,” Porter

g said. “I guess I was in the right

place at the right time.”

The sophomore’s first goal at
S6]:'i_2 of the ‘game was simply a
lesson in passing.
Noethling, after eluding his
man on the left side of the
field, dished it to Duffy, who
slid it over to Porter, who, after
deki.ng a defenseman and a

Ted’

 

goalie, buried it into the right
corner of the goal.

f‘[Porter"s] first goal came after
a great play by Noethling,”
Luxbacher said. “He came in
and beat agguy, picked his
head up and played the ball
,_right in, and Jeff got it on the
run and itwas a good shot
right in the corner.”

His offensive explosion
comes at .a time when he
appears to be breaking out of a

semislump. After struggling

early in the year, he has.

notched four goals in his previ-
ous three games, including the
game-winning, overtime goal at
St. Francis last Wednesday.
“[The hat trick is] sort of
funny because he has been
struggling all year missing so

many goals,” Luxbacher said. —

“He gets himself in goal scoring
situations because he’s very
quick and he’s physically

For Pitt fans the recent

ing contest like the two previ— '-

ous trips to Indiana were
before, it is still Notre Dame,
and “Touchdown Jesus” will
still be looking on.

The only difference this
time around will be the talent.
Most of it will stand on the
“golden” side of the field.

Pitt (1-3) takes to the road
for only the second time this
season, and its first time in

over a month, this Saturday‘
for its 1:50 p.m. clash with

number four Notre Dame (5-
0). ' I .

The last time the Panthers
donned their visiting jerseys
was against Southern
Mississippi on Sept. 2. That
win was head coach Johnny
Majors’ first and last since
returning to Pitt.

Will his luck change this

Nightmares aplenty for Pitt at South Bend

40'-point ‘underdog'Panthers hit grueling road, face #4 Notre Dame

weekend?

Probably not, but there are
some encouraging signs that
Majors’ Pitt team is improving.

“We’re coming off one
nationally-ranked football
opponent and playing against
another,” Majors said. “At
early points in the [Louisville]
ball game, ‘our football team
made progress. On defense
we moved quicker to the ball
than I have seen all year.

“It’s encouraging to see we
made progress in the off
week [before Louisvil1el,”
Majors added.

“It wou1dn’t“*be bad to have
this week off either, but we
don’t.’’ 9 ' '

Majors might even want
two or three weeks off to pre-
pare for the loaded Notre

Dame team he isabout to
face. '

Controlling the Notre Dame
offense is something Pitt must
do in order to have a shot at
the upset.

But that is easier said than
done.

Quarterback Kevin
McDouga1 is quick and has a
so—so arm. _ ‘

He will likely try to estab-
lish the Irish_ ground game
that is averaging 210.8 yards a
game.- ' ‘

Tailback Randy Kinder and
fullback Ray Zellars lead a
Notre Dame rushing assault
that has churned out 1,054
yards in its first five games.

However, the key to Notre
Dame’s offense is the line in

Playland
By Athol Fugard

. Directed by Mladen Kiselov

Starring David Butler and John
Henry Redwood '

' In 1967 the South African gov-

’ ernrnent lobbied for the suspen-

sio of playwright Athol Fugard’s
passport. Refusing to be bullied

into exile, Fugard said that his

“life’s. work is to witness as
truthfully as I can the’ nameless
and destitute of this one little
comer of the world.” ’

If this was Fugard’s goal in

‘ life, he has fulfilled it way
. beyond the realm of human

expectation. Not only has

Fugard witnessed the nameless
faces behind the South African
struggle against apartheid, but
over the years, he ha brought
them to life with such startling
conformity to correctness that
the characters he creates are
often some of the best ‘roles
written for both men and
women regardless of race.

City Theatre’s current produc-
tion, Fugard’s Playland, is no
exception. An internal drama
that takes place on New Year’s
Eve of 1989, it consists of a dia-
logue between a white ex-sol-
dier and a South African night
watchman for a traveling
amusement park called

Fugard’s Playland Genius at

Playland. The play is a layer
cake starting with surface small
talk as the icing, finishing with
the internal secrets of both men
as the batter.

Fugard constructs a story first
and foremost about people.
Whether the people are differ-

’ ent in terms of race, sex or class
is often a stomach-churning
issue in his work. It serves as a
catalyst for conﬂict, and where
conﬂict rears its head there is
often common ground not far in
the distance.

In this case, both men have
killed people. It’s their reasons
that vary. But in both instances,
the overriding political situation
and the injustice of apartheid
are the stirringfactors that
steered the men to their direct
routes of action. .

Belly, Head bring love rock to the ‘Burgh

By Karen Ochoa
For The Pitt News 1

,It’s not often that two amazing bands
join together for one tour. But every now
and then that rarity becomes reality. For
Pittsburgh, it will take place on Oct. 11
when England’s Radiohead co-bills with

Belly.

After a surprise hit on MTV with the

wallowing cries of love desperation in

“Creep,” Radiohead has been basking in.

temendous international success and
exposure.

Its album Pablo HONEY is gorged
with raging, almost neurotic lyrics of
emotional intensity pouring from vocalist
Thom Yorke’s heart.

Add the dynamic energy of a three
guitar power surge and you have the

remedy for depression.

Yorke’s apparent heartbreak is docu-
mented throughout the album. His sim-
ple yet impassioned words that lament

over a lost love send you swelling with
pity for his despair.

In perhaps the most straightforward,
sentimental line ever, he whimpers, “I
want you to notice when I’m not around,
you’re so f—-ing special, I wish I was
special.” .

Then the tears bulge beneath our eyes
because he’s trapped by that dreadful
feeling we’ve all had to deal with at least
once in our lives.

So we ride with Yorke on those emo-
tional waves of depression, anxiety and
sought after true love.

But by the finish of the album spirits
are lifted, as he has mastered the art of
self-healing by means of romping
through nostalgia and soaking in the pity
pools, and he looks optimistically
toward the future.

Yorke’s entire ordeal kindles our
insides and plants smiles on our faces
because of his recovery and our realiza-
tion that even pop stars get their hearts

Proving that band breakups are not the
end of the line, former Throwing Muses
guitarist Tanya Donelly fronts a new

band with a name that she has been i

obsessed with for some tirne-now. Belly
has recently braved the alternative music
horizon and is riding into the ears of the
rest of the world.

Plush guitars, sometimes slightly remi-
niscent of Lush, spiced with a dash of
country-western zest, swirl with
Donelly’s cottony, sweet-girl-next-door
voice.

With this combination and Donelly’s
lyrics, she takes us on a melodic and sur-
realistic journey through a world of tales
all her very own.

In “Angel” she tells her tale of talking
to God, and how he sent three angels to
move a river so that it flowed by her
house.

To drown us in an ethereal haze, she
sends a haunting over us as she repeat-

Opening with a twangy, southem gui-
tar, a story of Marie and an overindepen-

Donelly tags the man as a dog and
outright tells Marie that she should,
“carry a riﬂe” and get rid of the guy with
the “see-through skin,” in a soft but
bouncy manner.

A Bronx Tale

Directed by Robert De Niro

Written by Chazz Palminteri

Starring Robert De Niro and Chazz
Palminteri

Living in the Bronx, young Colagero
must make a lot of tough decisions as he
grows up. He must consider whether an
honest living is better than shooting dice.
He also must decide whether or not to
“rat” on a local mobster who killed a
man in front of the boy’s stoop.

A Bronx Tale, Robert De Niro’s debut
as a director, depicts Colagero’s coming
of age during the 19605 in a neighbor-
hood where good and evil live next door
to each other. Working class families

  Wit, Grit And Family In Two

struggle to survive. Meanwhile, on the
street, their children worship local mob-
sters for their popularity and charisma.

While the film features some believ-
able and engaging characters, the story
suggests an easy solution to many of the
major conflicts the main character and
his environment face during this time. In
that respect, it comes out flawed.

Nine-year-old Colagero (Lillo
Brancato) lives in an apartment with his
parents on East 187th Street. His father
Lorenzo (Robert De Niro)" is a hardwork-
ing bus driver trying to do good for his
family. Like a good parent, he constantly
reminds his son to avoid wasting his tal-
ent. He wants his boy to be successful in
life.

While the boy respects his father, he
reveres Sonny (Chazz Palminteri), the
well-dressed mobster who frequents the
neighborhood Chez Bipp bar. Sonny has
it all: money, looks, respect. Nobody is
cooler than him, Colagero thinks.

Colagero’s life changes when he sees
Sonny gun a man down on the street.
When he fails to identify his hero as the
murderer, Sonny takes him under his
wing in gratitude. Soon Colagero, who
Sonny christens “C,” is sneaking out of
his apartment to shoot dice in the base-
ment of Chez Bipp.

All this doesn’t bode well with papa
Lorenzo, who doesn’t want Sonny inﬂu-
encing his boy. “People don’t love him,
they fear him,” he tells Colagero. When

New Film

0'2

he finds winnings from a crap game in
his son’s room, Lorenzo gives it back and
tries to convince Colagero that it isn’t the
easy way to success. But his father's
warnings fall on deaf ears. When the film
jumps ahead eight years, we find
Colagero as another one of Sonny’s
pazons.

While A Bronx Tale presents the con-
flict of good (Lorenzo) versus evil
(Sonny), it wants to have it both ways
with inconsistent results. In the second
half of the film, when Colagero is 17, he
gets treated" like Sonny’s own child, yet
he still maintains a close relationship
with his father. He still rides with his dad
on the bus like hv (lid eight years earlier.

But A Bronx Tale almost
makes up for its shortcomings
by developing several engaging
characters that draw you into

; the story. Sonny is the quintes-

sential mobster, dressed in a
suit with his hair combed back
perfectly. When he stands on

“the street, always ﬂanked by his

thug Jimmy Whispers, he punc-
tuates his words with rapid
hand gestures. Lorenzo, as the
God—fearing workingman, bless-
es himself every time he passes

the church on his bus route; -

These idiosyncrasies make the
characters and the story more
engaging to the viewer.

Tbefoy Lucia Club

Directed by Wayne Wang
Screenplay by Amy Tan and
Ronald Bass

Tbejoy Lucie Club could have
been yet another ‘slushy, inef-

fective Hollywood adaptation of e

an excellent novel. Fortunately,
Wayne Wang’s version of Amy
T an’s best seller is a rare exam-
ple of an adaptation that‘ works
equally as well as the novel that
spawned it.

The story traverses three gen-
erations as it explores the lives
and relationships of four
Chinese immigrant women and
their American daughters, who

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

have to deal with no_t only the
usual parent-child conﬂicts, but
also cultural barriers and long
kept secrets, in order to under-
stand each other.

Amy\Tan and Ronald Bass’
screenplay is the key to the
movie’s success. They remain
true to the episodic nature of
the novel, selecting only the
most pertinent elements of each
character’s story and condens-

ing them into vignette-like seg- -

ments. The first one of these
vignettes comes across awk-
wardly and even seems a little
phony, but the narrative snow-
balls with every episode and the

phoniness dissipates, leaving us

’ t with a film that conveys the
~ complexities of each relation-

ship in a remarkably simple

H. way. - -

‘V Thejoy Luck Club helps to

‘H break down Asian stereotypes

by refusing to acknowledge

-them and presenting a straight-

forward story about Chinese
immigrants and the cultural dif-
ficulties they face.

Like all mothers, the women
in the film want their daughters
to have the opportunities they
never did. But they have to
struggle even more than most to
understand why their daughters
would rather watch the
Monkees than become piano

‘ prodigies because of the ever-

present shadow of the brutal
oppression they faced in China.

The film gives the average
American an important glimpse
into this "extreme abuse of
women under‘ the old Chinese
system and the horrifying sense
of female woithlessness it con-
veyed.

This culturally-imposed lack
of self—worth is passed from
mother to daughter as a sort of
unconscious emotional hand-
me-down.’_It is rare enough to
see a filmlthat deals with this
directly. However, the truly
unique aspect of \X7ang’s film is
that the role women play in per-
petuating this state is acknowl-
edged, instead of placing 100
percent of the blame on men.
Daughters Rose (Rosalind Chao)
and Waverly (Tamlyn Tomita)
consistently deny themselves in
their relationships with men,
and both realize the negative
consequences this has on them-
selves and their marriages. At
the same time, Wang has no
fear of portraying men in a less
than ﬂattering light.

The cast of fine Asian actress-
es’ assembled for this film is
unparalleled and will probably
not be seen together again. Kieu
Chinh portrays Suyuan, who is
forced to abandon her twin
daughters while fleeing, the
Japanese. ‘

Chinh brings the entire emo-

tional buildup of the movie to a
head in this scene with one

incredible gesture, as she llings ‘

herself down over her daugh-
ters for the last time. If anyone
has managed not to cry so far,
the" only way to avoid it at this

point would be to shut your

emotions down.

It is not just the individual
character’s stories that make the
movie so upsetting. It is the
implication of generations of
women that suffered and whose
talents were wasted, which is
inherent in Amy Tan’s story,
that is behind its jarring impact.
Despite all the emotional
upheaval the film may cause, it
still manages to be an entertain-
ing and sometimes funny
catharsis that is not to be
missed.

rhymes, although kinda light-
hearted like old school
freestyles, ﬂow like water. “The
Flows In Check” has a smooth,
laidback bassline that serves as
the main basis of this track. It
also has an eerie sound effect in
it (But I don’t know what it is.)
that gives this track a continu-
ous feel. In this one, the rhymes
get progressively harder with
more metaphors that appeal to
your imagination and make you

laugh a little.

The jewel of this tape has to
be the title song “Cement
From Da, Undaground.” This
joint has massive rumble, a stur-
dy (but used) dmmtrack and a
sprinkle of flute to add ﬂavor.
On this one, Woo Luv takes a
new approach and creates an
ignorant, rough-edged other
personality by the name of
Iron. As Iron, Woo drops some
of the illest sh*t around.

“I got /enic/as in my heaaVscars
on my face, wounds on my
chest/1’m always smo/ein’ cest.
From the homeof the sick, I’m
always pztllin’ trichs/I pulled so
many tricles puss oozes from my
d**le.

When he breaks down the
spelling of his name, he gets
kinda confused.

“The ‘I’ is for ignorant, ‘R’
meaning ragged/’O’ stands for
ugly. (“Yo, there.az'n’t no ‘O’ in

ugly. ”) Well the ‘I’ is for illiter-
ate ‘O’ oz2er—ranleed zero/ ‘N’
, ‘cause I ’m the nutty, nitwit nap-
pyheaded negro.”

This has gotten much play on
WPTS and in my stereo. In my
estimation, these kids should
have a deal soon. This tape is
phatter than some of the stuff
that’s out on the market now.
My only real beef with this tape
is that the sh*t’s not long
enough!! Those three songs left
me ﬁending for more. I guess I
have to keep in consideration
that this is a demo tape (minus
the hiss).

Don’t go by the Massingill
cover. (They use the actual art-
work used on the feminine
hygiene box as their artwork,
with their face in the middle
where the lady running in the
field was.) This tape is bomb!

roped in, you’re in for one of
the most old—school-based
albums to date. Akinyele defi-
nitely comes correct on this, his
debut LP. He recruited his long
time friend Large Professor to
handle the production job, and
what a friend he was on those
beats. He allows Ak to run ram-
pant all over these tracks with
his “drop—Voice” style. (For
those of you whose never heard
him rhyme, he drops his voice
real low at certain point in the
songs.)

“Ak, Ha Ha! Ak H00 H0o?”
started him ﬂying out the with a
basic music loop with a touch
of a drum track, and Ak’s
rhymes kickin’ like a punter.
“Dear Diary” has a phat
bassline and a basic drumtrack.

“The Bomb” is rugged as hell
with a crazy horn section in the
chorus, phat bassline and basic
drumtrack. If yousnoticed, the
production to the whole album
is very simple but funky. This
allows the spotlight to be on the
Ak.

To me, the dopest production
on the album is a 20-second
loop simply titled “Beat.” Since
I’m a piano freak, this loop
freaked me out. This should’ve
been made longer and rhymed,
too. Ak does come correct on
the rhyme tip. He has a bag full
of metaphors, bringing rap back
to being clever, where it should
have stayed.

Although I liked this album,
there are a couple of things that

could’ve been better. For one,
he should drop his voice in the
songs where he’s telling stories,
after a while that got very
annoying. Two, he should’ve
had some friends on here.
Being as though the production
was basic, he could’ve had
friends with him to help break
the monotony of hearing just his
voice. 1

Either that or get another style
of production. And finally, leave
the fast—forward material out.
(Believe me, there is some).

All in all, Akinyele is definite-
ly worth checking out. So come
and get some of that “home-
cooked hip—hop” that the
Vagina Diner is serving up.

Steady McDougal continues tradition of Irish quarterbacks

By Stephen Flinn
Staff‘ Writer

Notre Dame has had its share
of All-American quarterbacks,
some of which went on_to lead
very productive NFL careers.
Most notable among great
Fighting Irish quarterbacks of
recent time who come to mind
are Joe Montana, Joe
Theismann, Terry Hanratty,
Steve Beuerlein and, just
recently, Rick Mirer, who grad-
uated last year as Notre Dame’s
all-time leader in total offensive
yards (6,691), passing efficiency
(138.9) and touchdown passes
(41).

Due to the departure of
Mirer, the Irish were left with-
out an obvious successor at
quarterback, but they had three
good candidates to take over at

the wide-open helm coming‘

into this season.

Senior Kevin McDougal
topped the list, following a
strong spring showing and
earning the offensive MVP
award’ in Notre Dame’s spring
Blue-Gold Scrimmage. He
appeared in eight games last
season.

Junior

Paul Failla from

Pittsburgh ran a close second,
and was so close to McDougal

EXPERIENCE THE SENSATION!

in the race in fact, that he was
listed as 1-A on the quarterback
depth chart at the beginning of
this season’s camp.

But all eyes, Irish or not,
were on first-year phenom Ron
Powlus, who was given a
chance to earn the starting
quarterback position depending
on his preseason performance.
Apparently, Powlus passed the
test with flying colors as Notre
Dame’s preseason came to a
close and was well on his way
to earning the starting job. That
is  until five plays into Notre
Dame’s third scrimmage, when
Powlus’ ﬂying colors turned to
black.

A defensive lineman came
down on Powlus’ right side,
separating both his ‘throwing
arm from his shoulder, and him
from the starting quarterback
spot

“It was definitely a tragic day
for, Notre Dame football.
[Powlus] had the starting posi-
tion sewed up if only he had
just kept doing what he did in
the first two scrimmages,” Tim
Prister, editor of the Blue and
Gold Illzrstrated, said.

Notre-Dame head coach Lou
Holtz confirmed Prister’s
insight. \

“I had told both McDougal

and Failla that, had Powlus
continued at the same pace in
the rest of the preseason, he
would have been the starting
quarterback for Notre Dame in
our opening game,” Holtz said.

Following Powlus’ catastro-
phe, McDougal gladly stepped
right back into the starting
quarterback opening and was
named the starting quarterback
for Notre Dame.

He has performed well
enough to lead the Irish to a 5-
0 start, including wins at
Michigan — where he ran 49
yards for a touchdown — and
at Stanford.

“He surprised a lot of fans
with the run at Michigan and
his overall handling of the
option,” Prister said. “He is not
a good option quarterback by
trade.

"He just doesn’t have the nat-
ural talent to be a great option
quarterback such as Tony Rice.

“But what surprised me was
the amount of support he
received from the Notre Dame
fans at the start of the season,”
Prister added.

But McDougal’s performance
up to this point in the season is
no surprise to the most impor-
tant person of all, and that’s
himself.

“I have not really surprised
myself with my performance so
far this year,” McDougal said. “I
felt that I could do the job the
whole time.

"I think I will be the starter
for the rest of the year as long
as I perform. If things go
wrong, then I expect to be
replaced.”

McDougal’s statistics coming
into Saturday’s game are 45-70
for 593 yards and three touch-
downs.

Holtz feels the same way and
will not be hesitant to put in
Powlus at any time following
his recuperation from the bro-
ken arm.

“He is recuperating right on
track,_” Holtz said. “Redshirting
Powlus is not a factor. If he is
healthy and I feel he can help
us, he will play. If he is healthy
and I feel he cannot help us,

7

he will not play.”

For now, that leaves Kevin
McDougal starting at quarter-
back for the Irish.

Pitt head coach Johnny
Majors respects McDougal and
sees him as a formidable oppo-
nent in Saturday’s game at
South Bend.

“lMcDougall is an excellent,
strong quarterback,” Majors
said.

If McDougal performs as well
as he’s done in Notre Dame’s
previous five games, he’s sure
to cause some headaches for
the Panthers.

If not, Holtz will have no
qualms in replacing him with
Paul Failla.

Failla has appeared in four of
Notre Dame’s five games thus
far and has posted decent
results, throwing 7-8 for 108
yards.

Saturday afternoon the Pitt
rugby team will play its
most important. game of the
season. Last week’s home
loss to West Virginia has put
the Panthers in a “must win”
situation.

A victory for the Panthers
means clinching second
place and advancing to the
playoffs. A loss will leave
the team with a meaningless
consolation game.

The team that stands in
the way of Pitt’s‘playoff
drive is bitter rival California
State of Pennsylvania.

Bad blood exists between
the two teams that was
highlighted two years ago
by a brawl.

Last year Cal stunned the
Panthers 17-15 by coming
from behind and scoring on
a long run with less than

two minutes left in the—

Rugby faces Cal State

. game.

Junior Ken

Schollenberger, who used to

play for Cal, refers to his
former team as the “dirtiest
team” in the Allegheny
Rugby Union.

“They are a very physical
team,” Schollenberger said.
“They’ll beat on us the
whole game and possibly try
to hurt someone.

“They have a few good
players, but most "of their
guys are more concerned
with fighting than with
rugby.”

“We don’t like them, and
they don’t like us,” he
added.

The game will feature
Pitt’s finesse against Cal’s so-.

called “power” rugby.

The Pitt players are conﬁ-
dent that they will bring
home a win, and more
importantly, a playoff berth.

“If we keep our heads and
don’t fall into their game,

“But you will come to a place

I where the only thing you feel

are loaded guns in your face
and you ’ll have to deal with
pressure. ”

“Pressure”
— Billyjoel

The Pitt women’s tennis team
will be facing many of the
country’s big guns this week-
end and a great deal of pres-
sure, as they travel to Miami,
Fla., this weekend to compete
in the Big East Championships.

Tomorrow the Panthers
embark on a journey to com—
pete against some of the top
collegiate programs in the
country.

The Big‘East tennis tourna-‘
ment should not be confused
with the Big East basketball
tournament. There is no nation-
al tournament at the end of the
rainbow for the top teams. Play

is decided by all No. 1 seeds ,

playing each other, and all No.

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday‘, October 7; 1993
Women's tennis heads for league match

2 seeds playing each other, and
so on.

The players they will face are
not only some of the best play-
ers in this country, but the best
players from other countries as
well. Many of the players they

 

will be facing are nationally
ranked, which will greatly
increase the competition level.
“The tournament is very com-
petitive,” Pitt sophomore Marla
Zielinski said. “You get to play
against some of the top—ranked
players from this country.”
“The competition will be
about 10 times better than it is

around here,” Pitt head coach
George Dieffenbach said.

The host team, the Miami
Hurricanes, are considered by
many as the strongest team in
the tournament.

The Hurricanes have a player
personnel advantage over
many of the other teams in the
Big East.

“We can pull from some of
the tennis factories located
down here,” Miami women’s
tennis coach Kim Sands said.

The tennis schools located in
Florida take a back seat to no
others in this country.

Some of America’s top pro-
fessionals have been trained in

V Florida.

Many that don’t have the tal-
ent to turn professional end up
playing for the Miami
Hurricanes.

Advantages for the teams
from Florida is not lost on
Coach Dieffenbach.

“They have a big advantage
over us [Pitt]. Better weather,
geography, player recruitment,
reputation and funding helps
them a great deal,” he said.

The young Panther team is
hoping to finish somewhere in
the middle of the pack of Big
East teams.

Syracuse is expected to be

one of the teams strong
enough to compete with
Miami. ’ A J

Even though the pressure
will be intense, the Panthers
have been waiting a long time
for this trip to Florida.

“I’ve never had a hat
trick in college, and it’s
something really hard to
do,”'Noethling said. “Jeff
should be proud of it. He
worked hard and he
deserves it.”

“All three were typical
‘Jeff Porter goals  hard
working,” Duffy said. “He
just stuck his nose in,
dug in and got ‘em.”

Porter, who rattled two
more in later in the half,
made goalie Adam
Spitzer’s job pretty easy
in the second period, but
the first half was a differ-

ent story — a scoreless
tie at halftime with a now
2-9 squad.

But while Duffy and
Noethling saw opportuni-

ties go for naught, the J
-, final score, and Porter’s

record—setting perfor-
mance, redeemed all 
er most mistakes.

“I had a couple nice
passes but missed a cou-
ple of goals,” Duffy said.
“It worked out, though 
we looked pretty good
out there today. We out-
played them and played
three Amen up front
instead of just one tar-
get.”

Noethling, who upped
his point total to six, was
equally happy with the
Panthers’ performance

“We stepped it up a
notch,” he said. “I feel
we played tight on
defense, and it helped
our offense by giving us
good balls for us to move
and get the good passes
and get the shots on
goal. We could have had
better offense, but that
will come.”

Because of
injury sustained in last
1-0 .loss ' at
Villanova by regular start-
ing goalie Kirk Brodows,
Adam Spitzer got his first
start in net since the
Panther’s 4-4 tie at SUNY
Buffalo. Spitzer made the

most of the opportunity _

by recording his first
shutout of the season.

“I was stupid at the
beginning of the season
and kind of got my act
together during practice,
so ‘ I guess Coach
[Luxbacher] figured he’d.
just give me another
shot,” Spitzer said. “I was
fine, but I was a little
anxious because it was
my first time playing in a
while.”

Despite the shutout,
however, Luxbacher
stressed this is not a-per-
manent goalie change.

“Adam’s a top goal-
tender . . we’re lucky to
have two top goal-
tenders. But we were
going to give lBrodowsl a
rest tonight,” Luxbacher
said. “He could have
played, but we sat him.”

head coach Lou Holtz said.
“We’ve worked real hard at it.”

Holtz’s defense has also been
of the hard-working kind. Led
by a strong line, ND’s defense
will force Pitt to throw against
it to put points on the board.

But the Irish coach expected I

that.

“I thought [at the beginning
of the season] we had a chance
to be a great defensive team,”
Holtz said. “Our defensive line
is solid, but we have had our
problems at linebacker.”

The defensive line, led by
tackle Bryant Young, has kept
opponents’ rushing attacks at a
standstill.

In ﬁve games, Irish foes have
averaged only 83 yards per
game on the ground.

Through the air, however,
Notre Dame has been suscepti-

backfield, teams have been
able to throw with success.

“We have given up too many
big plays on third down,” Holtz
said.

“I thought we would be a lit-
tle better in that area.”

But with the number—four
ranking in the country, there is
only minimal room for

improvement in any area.

describing the team he will

have a lot of talent.”
