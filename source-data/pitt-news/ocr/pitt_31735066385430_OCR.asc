PIITSBURGH CAMPUS

This information is being provided to you as part of Pitt's commitment to safety and security on campus and is in compli-
ance with Pennsylvania's College and University Security Information Act — PA Act 73.

”We at the University of Pittsburgh care deeply about the safety and well-being of everyone on campus,
and we have hundreds of people involved in keeping this campus safe and secure. However, a truly
safe campus can only be achieved through the cooperation of the entire University community:

0 students, faculty, and staff. This brochure is a part of our effort to insure that this collaborative endeavor
is effective. We hope that you will read it carefully and use the information to help foster a safe
environment for yourself and others on the University campus.”

Wesley W. Posvar
President

A Safe Campus In a Safe city

A stimulating educational environment. And a safe one.
The University of Pittsburgh offers you both. Hundreds of
individuals at Pitt are involved in providing you with a safe
living and learning environment to make your experience at
Pitt as full of growth and as hassle-free as possible.

You'll also be pleased to know that the City of Pitts-

3 burgh is a safe city, with significantly lower crime rates than

most other major metropolitan areas. Its high safety ranking
(along with its excellence in educational, cultural, and health
facilities) is a major reason why Pittsburgh was selected as the
Most Livable City in the US.

A Safe campus is Everyone’s Responslblllty.

Pitt's security policies and procedures are aimed at your safety
and welfare. You help maintain your own safety on campus
by following all security policies, and by using commonsense
safety practices, such as walking in groups; reporting suspi-

0 cious activity; not leaving books, coats, or backpacks unat-
tended; etc.

The following pages will provide you with an over-
view of security facts that will be helpful to you. While this
brochure may be more relevant to undergraduate students,
much of the information will be of value to graduate students
and Pitt employees as well. Everyone on campus should be
safety conscious and follow security procedures.

 
The ofiices responsible for campus security:

3 The Department of Public Safety (624-2121 or 648-2121) has
primary responsibility for security on campus. Other offices
that have security responsibilities include the Housing and
Food Service Office (648-1100) and the Office of Residence Life
(648-1200).

The hospitals and clinics in the Medical and Health
Care Division of Pitt each have their own separate security
staffs and procedures. When Pitt staff and students work

0 within these settings, they are responsible for acquainting
themselves with the security policies of these facilities. Since
those units are autonomous, the following information per-
tains to main campus security only.

“The primary mission of Pitt's
Department of Public Safety is to
protect University students and
personnel, their guests, and
visitors to the University. This is
a 24-hour, 7-day-a-week opera-
tion. Students, faculty, and staff
may notify this department. of
problems and call for assistance
at any time of the day or night. "

Walter V. Waters, Acting Director
Department of Public Safety

 

The people who work hard to keep you safe:

Pitt’ s Department of Public Safety has the third largest police
force in Allegheny County (the City of Pittsburgh is first, and
Allegheny County is second). Pitt spends more than $3
million on security annually. Security personnel include 72
sworn uniformed police officers and supervisors plus 27
guards and 3 dispatchers. Campus police officers and their
supervisors patrol the campus and answer calls 24 hours a
day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. They are armed and
empowered to arrest.

Police officers and their supervisors receive 480 hours
of training following the guidelines of the Municipal Police

Education and Training Law. This is the same training any .

city or borough lice officer would receive.

Unarm guards are used in areas such as parking lots.
Indoor garages provide escort service upon request. Guards
receive inservice training and are equipped with walkie-

ﬁtalkies with which to contact the campus police if there is a
security problem.

In addition, entrances to all ten residence halls have
securi desks with attendants monitoring who goes in and
out 24 ours a day, 7 days a week when classes are in session,
and during some other designated periods when residence
halls are open. There are approximately 95 desk attendants.
Each year desk attendants attend a workshop where they
review all University security procedures. Desk attendants
are also monitored on the job.

 

campus police authority:

Campus police have complete police authority to apprehend
and arrest anyone involved in illegal acts on campus and im-
mediately adjacent to the campus. If the offense is committed
by a University student, the campus police may also refer the
individual to the Campus Judicial Board.

Campus police work closely with local police officers.
Campus police have direct two-way communication with city
police on the city police radio system.

State and local police:

In accordance with Pennsylvania's College and University
Security Information Act—PA Act 73, all campus crimes are
reported to the State Police. All arrests and serious crimes,
such as felonies, are also reported to the City of Pittsburgh
Police. The serial numbers of all vehicles and office equipment
stolen from campus are reported nationwide.

‘In student affairs, we are corr
cerned about the whole person,
and that includes concern for
your safety and security.

“It is my hope that you
will read this brochure thoroughly.
An informed student is a
safer student, and a safer stu-
dent means a safer environment
for everyone. ”

Dennis E. Donham, Assistant
Vice President
Office of Student Affairs

University buildings and programs:

Except for residence halls (See the next page.), most University
facilities are open to the public during the day and evening
hours when classes are in session. During the times that the
University is officially closed, University buildings are gener-
ally locked and only faculty, staff, and—for some buildings-
students with a Pitt ID are admitted. Athletic facilities require
an appropriate ID for admittance at all times.

Some Pitt-sponsored programs are open to the general
public while others are restricted to students with a Pitt ID.
Additional security personnel are hired for major events such
as football and basketball games.

How you can report criminal actions or other emergencies:

You may report criminal activity or other emergencies by
dialing the campus police at 4-2121 or 8-2121. (When off-
campus, dial 624-2121 or 648-2121.) There are also 60 emer-
gency phones scattered throughout campus that ring directly
into the campus police office, automatically registering the
location of the caller. Campus police also make themselves
visible around campus.

Resident students may also inform their resident assis-
tant (RA) or resident director (RD) of any problems or con-
cerns, and everyone can approach guards or desk attendants.
These individuals have telephones or radios by which to
Contact the campus police and any other appropriate office. A
problem may also be reported in person at the Public Safety
Ofﬁce on the G1 level of Forbes Quadrangle.

Campus olice respond to all complaints. There are at
least three patro cars out on all shifts, as well as numerous of-
ficers on foot patrol.

A student, a resident director, a campus police officer,
or any other member of the University communi ma also
refer a violation of the Student Code of Conduct irect y
to the University Student Judicial System.

Alcoholic beverages:

Pitt enforces all state laws regarding the possession, use, and
sale of alcoholic beverages, including those prohibiting under-
age drinking, and goes further:

1. The University restricts the use of alcohol at events
involving groups within the University community. Consid-
erations include the average age of the group, the location of
the event, and the source of the funds used to purchase the
alcoholic beverages.

2. Residents who are 21 or older may bring alcohol into
a residence hall, but they must register this alcohol with the
desk attendant. The amount is tallied and totaled regularly
with strict limits on the amount of alcohol that may be brought
in by any resident in any week.

illegal drugs:

The University enforces all state and federal laws concerning

illegal drugs. Anyone who is apprehended by the campus
police in possession of, using, or selling illegal drugs is ar-
rested.

Possession and use of weapons:

All campus police officers and their supervisors carry revolv-
ers while on duty. These weapons may be used only when
there is a serious, imminent, identiﬁable threat to life or a
threat of great bodily harm.

No one other than police department personnel may
carry firearms on campus.

Previous criminal records:

Except for applicants to some graduate schools, such as
Medicine and Law, prospective students are not asked about
previous criminal records.

Prospective employees are asked if they have ever
been convicted of a crime other than a misdemeanor or sum-
mary offense. The University does not hire a candidate for a
position if a prior offense indicates that the hiring would create
a significant threat to the University community or the public.

campus maintenance policies to keep you safe:

Pitt has installed and maintains exterior lighting around all of
its buildings, as well as additional sidewalk and street light-
ing, to keep the campus well-lit. While maintaining an attrac-
tive campus, grounds crews keep shrubs and hedges low, es-
pecially in places such as bus stops, for student safety.

On any normal University workday, there are scores of
University support personnel whose jobs include providing
inspection of the entire campus and its buildings to discover
and correct health, safety, and maintenance problems. These
staff members include approximately 280 custodians and 60
operating engineers. The engineers are on duty 24 hours a day,
7 days a week, 365 days a year looking for problems. This is in
addition to the campus police and others who also tour the
grounds and report any safety and security problems to Pitt's
Physical Plant Department, which responds to correct these
problems promptly.

Students as well as faculty and staff may also call
Physical Plant (4-9512) to report any security or maintenance
problems. Resident students can fill out a Housekeeping
Maintenance Request slip describing any potential hazard or
maintenance problem that needs to be corrected or repaired.

How you can ieam about campus safety and security:

In accordance with FA Act 73, all students and employees
receive updated security information annually. All student
applicants or accepted students are also provided with infor-
mation on security policies and procedures and on how to
obtain additional security data.

When freshmen arrive on campus, they receive the
official Student Handbook with sections on justice, and health
and safety, and a booklet describing the University of Pitts-
burgh Student Code of Conduct and Judicial Procedures.

During summer advising and orientation sessions,
student mentors meet with freshmen and their parents to
discuss safety and security.

Security concerns are also discussed as they arise in the
biweekly University Times, published for faculty and staff,
and in the student newspaper The Pitt News which comes out
four times a week.

Students in residence halls also receive additional secu-
rity information, as described on the next page.

 

 

"The judicial process is here for
all students. A student who feels
wronged by another student can
bring that individual before the
Campus Judicial Board. The Uni-
versity Student Judicial System is
set up so that a student who
brings charges doesn't have to
make a presentation. My ofﬁce
has people who sort through the
information, contact witnesses,
and get the story told so that
justice can be achieved. "

Brenda J. Pardini, Coordinator
University Student Judicial Sys-
tern

gyou Ilve on-campus, the following security lnfonnatlon is
r you.

Residence halls and other undergraduate housing:

All on-campus housing is undergraduate. Residence halls
include singles, doubles, triples, uads, and suites that house
4-10 students. There are two resi ence halls for females onl .
One of these includes sorority housing. The other eig t
residence halls are coed.

The eight hillside fraternity houses on campus also
provide single sex housing. Some upperclassmen live in

aternity and sororilz houses off-campus, which are owned
and operated by the aternity or sorority.

In addition, the University occasionally refers under-
graduates to the housing division of nearby Carlow College
where they may enter into a housing agreement with the
College. Like Pitt, Carlow is subject to PA Act 73, and provides
security and information about security on its campus.

  

i-iousing assignments and requests for assignment
changes:

In Pitt residence halls, approximately 1,850 beds are reserved
for freshmen. Students who request speciﬁc roommates are
assigned those students when possible. Other housing assign-
ments are based on characteristics freshmen give on their
application forms. Current criteria include: 1) Smoker or non-
smoker. 2) Desire for a quiet area. 3) Does student object to
activity after 11 p.m.? 4) Does student study late—after ll p.m.?

For upperclassmen, a lottery determines the pool of
2,250 students eligible for the next year’ s room selection. The
lottery is followed by a room selection period. Students can
retain the room they are currently in, choose another room, or
get together an eligible group and bid on a suite. Rooms are
bid on by class standing and lottery number so that the senior
with the lowest lottery number would be the first to select an
available room.

Students may request a room change for a variety of
reasons. If the reason is a roommate dispute, the Resident
Assistant (RA) attempts to help resolve the conﬂict. If the
conﬂict cannot be resolved, the student may complete a room
change request form and seek the a propriate approvals. If
space is available and the housing of 'ce deems it appropriate,
the office makes a new housing assignment.

Residence hall security and visitors:

Entrances to all ten residence halls have security desks with
attendants monitoring who goes in and out 24 hours a day, 7
days a week when classes are in session and during some other
designated periods when residence halls are open.

To enter a residence hall, residents must show their Pitt
ID with the color-coded security sticker that identifies them as
residents of that residence hall. Visitors must be signed in and
out by the residents they are visiting, and visitors must also
show an ID. Five forms of identification are acceptable: Pitt ID,
driver’ s license, LCB card, picture business card, and social
security card. The host must escort the visitor at all times
during the visitor’ s stay in the residence hall. The approval of
a resident’ s roommate(s) is required for overnight visitors.

The residence hall staff provides monitoring to see that
visitation policies are complied with.

“Campus and" residence hall
security is a partnership. The
student is a full partner along
with the RA (ResidentAssistant),
the security desk attendant, the
campus police, and numerous
other individuals in maintaining a
safe and secure environment for
himself and others. ”

Jo Ann M. Woodson, Director
Office of Residence Life

 

Securing entrances:

All residence halls are entered through electronically locked
security doors that are opened by a buzzer from the security
desk after the desk attendant has obtained the proper identi-
fication.

Security features in students’ rooms:

Each residence hall student room has its own lock and key.
Keys do not contain room numbers so that a lost key cannot
be identified with a articular room.

All residence halls have locked windows or new double
hung windows with either window stops or firmly affixed
full screens. There is a substantial fine for tampering with
screens or window locks.

RAs, RDs, and others who help make University residence
halls safe:

86 Resident Assistants (RAs) and 7 Resident Directors (RDs)
are assigned to the residence halls. In residence hall areas that
house predominantly freshmen, there is an RA on every ﬂoor.
RDs supervise the RAs.

RAs and RDs receive comprehensive training before
each school year begins. This training includes how to handle
various emergencies from psychological emergencies to
health, fire evacuation, disorderly conduct, vandalism, etc.

The staff of the Office of Residence Life (648-1200),
which supervises the RAs and RDs, is available to assist
students during the day. RAs and an RD are on duty every
evening, night, and weekend during all three Pitt terms to
help students with any kind of problem. RAs provide extra
security by touring their ﬂoors on a regular basis both during
the week and on weekends.

All campus police officers are responsible for security
within the residence halls on their respective beats. One
campus police officer is assigned inside the Lothrop resi-
dence hall and the Victoria Building. Another is assigned
inside the Towers residence halls, the Schenley Quadrangle
residence halls, and the William Pitt Union. (For information
about security desk attendants assigned to residence halls,
see above.)

How you can ieam about residence hall security proce-
dures:

When you check into a residence hall, you are given a packet
that includes information about campus safety and residence
hall security, e.g., who to call in case of an emergency, how to
mark valuables, procedures to follow in case of a fire evacu-
ation, visitation policies, alcohol and drug policies, general
campus safety, etc.
Posters promoting safety (Lock your doors! Walk in a
oup!) are prominently displayed throughout the residence
alls.
The Office of Residence Life presents safety and secu-
rity programs every year, including Alcohol Awareness Week,
a health fair, and a security forum. RAs also have programs

on their ﬂoors around security issues such as self defense, as
well as programs on social and health needs.

Housing during holidays and between temrs:

The residence halls are totally unoccupied and closed during
the Christmas break, which is also the hiatus between the fall
and winter terms. As a service to students during other
periods between terms, the University provides housing upon
student request.

The University does not staff security desks between
terms. The University may staff security desks during the
Thanksgiving and spring breaks depending on circumstances.

During break periods, campus police increase the
number of patrols in these areas. During the Thanksgiving
and spring breaks, RAs are also on duty and patrol the residence
halls. Students are also cautioned to be more careful of
security needs during these periods.

Guests other than visitors of residents:

Guests, other than visitors of residents, are housed in the
residence halls when space is available during the summer
months, approximately May 1 to August 15. The only guests
that may be housed are those attending Pitt-sponsored aca-
demic or social programs, groups that have an educational or
academic purpose, and occasionally relatives of patients in a
University-affiliated hospital.

Off-campus housing:

Off-campus housing owned by Pitt is almost entirely for
graduate students and their families. This housing consists of
30 buildings. Most are apartment buildings with apartments
of varying sizes, but a few are single family homes. Graduate
students who occupy these facilities interact with the Univer-
sity in a normal tenant-landlord relationship, and no other
regulations pertain.

Your University community consists of:

*Full-time undergraduates 13,048
Part-time undergraduates 5,560
Total 18,608
Full-time graduate students 5,055
Part-time graduate students 4,701
Total 9,756
Full-time faculty and staff 7,999
Part-time faculty and staff 1,004
Total 9,003

4,379 undergraduates live in student housing on campus.

700 students (90—95% graduate students plus a few juniors
and seniors) live in University-owned housing off campus.

*Figures are for Pittsburgh campus, September 1987.

 
TIPS FOR A SAFE CAMPUS

Learn and follow all University security policies. These policies
were created out of a concern for your welfare and consideration for
the rights of others.

When walking or jogging:

Go with someone.

Stay away from isolated areas.

Try to stay near streetlights.

Hold your purse or briefcase tightly, close to your body. A
front pocket is safer for a wallet than a back one.

Dress sensibly. Tight pants, clogs, or heels make movement
difficult.

If you're being followed:

Cross the street or change direction.

Keep looking back so the person knows you can't be sur-
prised.

Go to a well-lighted area. Enter a store, house, residence hall,
classroom, or library——anywhere there are people.

Notice and remember as much as possible about the person
so you can give a good description.

If you're held up:

Don't resist. No amount of money is worth taking chances
with your life.

Notify campus security or local police immediately. Try to
give a description that includes approximate age, height,
weight, and details on hair, clothing, jewelry, scars, tattoos-
anything that is noticeable.

Where you live:
Keep your doors locked night and day.
Don't let strangers in.
Don't leave a door unlocked for someone planning to come
back later.

Protect personal and University property:

Lock your door every time you leave.

Engrave expensive equipment and valuables with an ID
number.

Don't store your purse in an unlocked desk drawer.

Don't leave your belongings (books, gym bags, backpacks,
calculators, coats, etc.) unattended in libraries, hallways,
gym facilities, or classrooms.

If you are working late:
Keep your office door locked.
Lock all doors behind you when entering or exiting at night.

In a car:
Keep door locked while driving.
Don't pick up hitchhikers.
Check the back seat before getting into a car.

Protect your car:
Always lock your car and take the keys.
Lock valuables in the trunk.
Park in well lighted areas.
Don't hitchhike.

Report suspicious activity and vandalism immediately.

Pitt's Heinz

By Betty Sarafin
Staff Writer

After two years of preparation,
the 50th Anniversary of Heinz
Chapel will be commemorated
this weekend and will feature the
annual Christmas concert
presented by the University of
Pittsburgh Department of Music.

The free concert series, ”Mus—
ic for the Christmas Season,” will
be held Friday, Dec. 9, at 8:30
p.m. and Sunday, Dec. 11, at 3
p.m.

The conductors to be featured
are Dr. Don Franklin, Ph.D., and
Dr. Kypros Markou, Ph.D. The

charities and then have approxi-
mately six weeks to raise money
for the cause. McCormick picked
the American Cancer Society be-
cause last year a McCormick resi-
dent died of cancer.

”We won because more peo-
ple care at McCormick, and the
people that were involved were
hard workers,” said Bern Com-
fort, McCormick’s executive
board representative.

The students involved in the

challenge organized raffles,

movie nights, auctions, parties

and sales to raise funds. They also
collected money in their
buildings.

McCormick’s biggest fundrais-
er was canning. They asked for
donations on the streets of Oak-
land, starting as early as 6 a.m.

Lothrop Hall, which raised
over $400, had a human auction.
They auctioned prizes such as air-
time on WPTS, cooking service,
evenings of movies and jazz and
RSA president Gene Cunnin-
gham offered massages to the
highest bidder.

McCormick wins Lothrop charity challenge

Cunningham says the Lothrop
Challenge is important because
”it supports unity in the univer-
sity. lt impresses on the students
that we can pull together and
raise money for a good cause.”

Tower C also had a human
auction. ”We raised a lot of
money with this,” Lori Schlegel
said. ’’All the money we raised is
going to the Humane Society.”

Other charities included were:
Children’s Hospital, the Cleft Pal-
ate Center, Family House and the

in 1938, Heinz Chapel was do-
nated to the University of Pitts-

burgh by the Heinz family in
memory of Anna Margeretta
Heinz, who founded the chapel,
and her son, Henry John Heinz.

Senator John Heinz and his
family will attend the concert se-
ries this year, as they have in
previous years, along with other
trustees and corporate heads.

Orin Skinner, former chief as-
sociate for the Charles Connick
Stain Glass Studio, which
designed the windows for Heinz
Chapel in 1938, will also attend
the anniversary celebration.

The stained-glass windows are

only one of several fine crafts that ,

went into the construction of

Heinz chapel. Other examples of
solid craftsmanship include the
stone carvings, ornate woodwork
and the wrought iron, hammered
out by hand by a Jewish-
Ukrainian immigrant, Samuel
Yellin.

During the past 50 years, the
chapel has provided the univer-
sity community with worship and
memorial services, musical con-
certs and wedding ceremonies.

Other groups such as the Men's
Glee Club, Women's Choral En-
semble and the Renaissance and
Baroque Society have held per-
formances in the chapel.

Fifth Avenue shut.

Eirene wishes to symbolically’

close the building because of its
military contracts with the U.S.
Department of Defense. Eirene
also intends to be arrested for his
actions. The rally will take place
on the first anniversary of the
opening of SEI.

Eirene is outwardly opposed to
the nuclear arms race and to mili-

tary contracts on a college‘

campus.

”l think it's important to
rememberthat this is the one-
year anniversary of the grand
openingof SEI. We would like to
make this an annual event to
‘remember the waste and the
premeditated murder that is
represented in SEl,” Eirene said.

A spokesperson from SEl
offered no comment about the
rally this weekend..but did con-
firm that SEl is funded by the
Department of Defense.

Director of Security at CMU
Jim LaPhelia said, ”We have a
freedom of speech policy. We
will be there toensure order and
safety, and we don't anticipate
any problems.”

He added that, at his request,
the Pittsburgh police will be
present at the rally to aid the
CMU police.

The rally will also conclude a
13-day vigil and fast by Eirene in
protest of the nuclear arms race.
, ”The vigil began on the first
day of Advent, on which Christi-
ans prepare their hearts to
celebrate the birth of Christ,” Ei-
rene said. ”We would hope that
the light of our faiths would shine
on the darkness of the nuclear
arms race and specifically SEI.”

The marchers will consist of
Pitt students, CMU students, peo-
ple from the community and war
veterans, according to Eirene.

Eirene has been in and out of
prison for the past 13 years for
partaking in civil disobedience

Gorbachev announces major reductions in arms _

NEW YORK (AP) ~ Mikhail
Gorbachev, armed with a bold
new plan to reduce the Soviet
armed forces, met with Ronald
Reagan and George Bush yester-
day at a historic superpower
lunch, closing one chapter in
U.S.—Soviet relations and opening
another.

The Soviet leader, belittling

military power as a solution to in-

ternational tensions, told the
United Nations General Assem-
bly that tens of thousands of
tanks, as well as troops, would be
withdrawn from Eastern Europe-
an countries, and other forces
would be pulled from Mongolia
and Asia in a reduction in size of
the Soviet military machine.

And he called for a Jan. 1
ceasefire in Afghanistan, for the
creation of a U.N. force to keep
the peace there, the formation of
a broad-based Afghan govern-
ment and an end to all arms ship-
ments to either side in that
country's war. The United States
has been aiding anti-communist
fighters in that war.

While Gorbachev was spelling
out his actions and his ideas, Rea-
gan and Bush flew separatelv to

New York to have lunch with
him on Governors Island, a se-
cure spot across New York Har-
bor from the Statue of Liberty.

Reagan, Gorbachev and Bush
— all three smiling in the bright
sunshine and mild temperatures
— posed for pictures on the steps
of the two—story brick and
columned Admiral’s House,
where lunch was to be served.
Two cannons of the Civil War era
stood outside the building and
the three steps to the front porch
were flanked by the American
and Soviet flags.

State law on secrecy

PHILADELPHIA (AP) ~—- The

Optometrist pleads
innocent in hearing

PITTSBURGH (AP) ~ Five
women told a state licensing
board examiner that a Lawrence
County optometrist fondled them
during office visits, but the doc-
tor told the board that none of the
alleged incidents ever occurred.

The testimony came Tuesday
before the state Bureau of Profes-
sional and Occupational Affairs,
which will determine whether to
revoke the license of David
Schmolly, 43, of New Castle.

The presiding officer, Alfred
Palaez, said he will decide the
case sometime after January.

Schmolly was found innocent
on the same allegations in a
criminal trial in January. He told
Palaez he had no idea why the

Pearl Harbor deaths
honored by Casey

HARRISBURG (AP) ~ Gov.
Robert P. Casey on Wednesday
paid tribute to the 2,300 Ameri-
cans who died at Pearl Harbor,
and those military personnel who
survived the sneak attack on the
Hawaiian naval base 47 years
ago.

During a ceremony on the
Capitol steps, Casey addressed
members of the Pennsylvania
Survivors of the Pearl Harbor At-
tack. The attack triggered the
United States’ entrance into
World War II.

’’In the early light of that Pearl
Harbor dawn, you were Ameri-
ca’s first line of defense,” he said.
”You were called upon to make
tremendous personal sacrifices in
the months and years that fol-
lowed. Your leadership and
courage inspired the rest of the

SG B discusses safety
concerns on campus

3, Erik Kridle
Staff Writer

Student Government President
Craig Jackson called the safety of
Pitt students a ”partnership” be-
tween students and the public
safety department at last night's
final meeting ofthe 1988 Student
Government Board.

”No matter what we do, peo-
ple_ have to make an effort to pro-
tect themselves,” Jackson said.

”They have to use their heads
when walking home, and when
home, they must lock their doors
and windows to protect them-
selves and their property. No one
promised any student a crime-
free environment. We live in a
city, and there are going to be
problems,” he said.

Jackson praised the Campus
Police for their diligence and ef-
forts in reducing crime. But, he
said, the Campus«Police can't be
everywhere at once.

Incidents of crime that occur
off—campus in areas like South
Oakland are not responded to by
the Campus Police because they
have no jurisdiction off—campus,
he said.

Jackson also expressed disap-
pointment at the low number of
students who take advantage of
the free taxi service created by
last year's board.

”All of our efforts will be for
naught if people do not use them.
The taxi service is there to escort
people home safely,” Jackson
said.

In other business, Robin

Shepherd, Allocations Commit-
tee chairwoman, announced the
names of next year’s Allocations
Committee members to take
office in January. Three members
of the current SCB along with
three members of the current Al-
locations Committee reviewed
approximately 40 applications
and conducted personal inter-
views with all the applicants be-
fore selecting the new committee
members.

”We were basically looking for
people who would be dedicated
and hard-working,” Shepherd
said. ”They must be able to think
clearly and come to rational de-
cisions.”

By Sharon Kerestes
For The Pitt News

A petition has been circulated
around the Pitt campus to gather
student support for a proposal to
enlarge the fitness facilities at
Trees Hall.

Bill Leezer, a sophomore at Pitt
has been trying to figure out a
way of proposing a larger weight
room and a multi-purpose room.

According to Leezer, the
problem with the weight room is
that it is too small to serve the
needs of the many University stu-
dents who want to use it.

Leezer said, ”The way it stands,
the fitness. center serves 40-50
students in a 50 minute lifting
period." It is regulated this way
to give as many students as pos-
sible the chance to use the
facililty. But over—crowding ap-
pears to be a problem.

Bob Lammey, a frequent user
ofthe weight room, said, ’’I think
the facility is decent but it's not
large enough to accomodate the
number of people that want to
use it.”

A Pitt senior, Bob Moore,
joined Forbes Fitness Center be-
cause of the problem of crowds
at the Trees Hall facility. He said,
’’I think it's ridiculous that the
University has only one small
weight room for so many
people.”

Leezer has already spoken to
Marilyn Ross, who is in charge of
the fitness center at Trees. She has
been sending proposals to im-
porve the facilities to the Univer-
sity for the past few years but they
have been rejected.

Ross’s proposal involves ex-
cavating the basement floor of
Trees Hall and constructing,
among other things, a small jog-
ging track and a Nautilis area.

Dean Billick, the Associate
Director of Athletics, told Leezer
that the proposal for rennovations
was high on the priority list and
that there was a possibility of
state funding for the project.

Leezer has formulated his own
ideas for rennovation which in-
_vo|ve moving the fitness center to
the locker rooms and vice versa.

”They really don't need all of

the lockers they have in there,”
Leezer said. ”lt’s wasting space.”

Leezer’s first step in getting the
proposal approved is to approach
Ken Metz of the School of Edu-
cation. '

He also plans to approach Mar-
ilyn Ross again, then University
President Wesley Posvar.

Leezer sees students and even
faculty members as an important
means of getting the proposal ap-
proved. He said, ”We have to
show them that we feel it's im-
portant.”

To gather student support Leez-
er began a petition. He said, ’’I
left the proposal sitting in the resi-
dence halls just to see how many
people would sign it.” He is hap-
py with the results and estimates
300-400 signatures so far.

New Soviet action a
sign of new direction

Though Mikhail Gorbachev left the U.S. early, his ideas
look like they're here to stay.

The Soviet leader is the first of his kind to visit New York
in 28 years. He started his tour on Tuesday and has now
announced cuts in the Soviet conventional forces in
Eastern Europe.

The reductions, most to be implemented by 1991, in-

" clude tens of thousands of Soviet groundtroopsiand thou-

sands of tanks;

This move, while apparently just a gesture of goodwill,
is actually beneficial for both the West and the East. NATO
breathes easier with the reduction of Soviet forces in
Eastern Europe, and it helps the Soviets economically, for

_ the hardware to be removed is old and deficient weaponry

which is costing the U.S.S.R. a lot of money to keep in
service.

The benefit that the Soviets gain from the withdrawal
is actually good to see. It seems to represent a larger con-
cern by the Soviets for the condition of their country rather
than the security of it. ' .

Gorbachev has put a large element of reality into what
had, in the past, been a mostly futile effort. He seems to
want to reduce arms and tensions between the Soviet
Union and the West. The tour of the United States and
the unsolicited cuts in conventional forces are signs of the
reality behind Gorbachev’s plan of ”new openness.”

However, it is wise to proceed cautiously from this point
on. There is nothing to be lost by being careful. But these
moves and changes by the Soviets can be described as
nothing but heartening. »

Security a problem in Towers  

In regards to personal safety
about campus, I feel that there is
a bad problem with the security
in the residence halls, the Tow-
ers in particular. I am able to go
into Tower B with my l.D. for
Tower A a-nd into Tower A
without even flashing my |.D.
The security people seem to be
too occupied shooting the breeze
with groups of students, or talk-
ing on the phone, or even doing
a crossword puzzle! 

With finals coming soon and
[large numbers of students] com-
ing in at late hours, something
should be done. With the situa-
tion as it is now, anyone off the
street could wander into a dorm.
Action should be taken before the
tragedy of a murdered student
takes place, just like what hap-
pened at Drexel and Lehigh.
Good safety practices should
should start at home, and the
dorms are a home to many.

False alarms a nuisance
I would just like to take the

time out of my hectic schedule of
studying for finals to thank the fi re

marshal as well as the University
Police for the lesson they taught
me on Sunday at 4 a.m., and let
me tell you, it was a valuable
one.

At approximately 3:35 a.m.,
the fi re alarm went off in my resi-
dence hall — Lothrop Hall.’This
being a regular occurrence, many
students didn't bother to answer

its call. The few that did go, my- '

self included, were made to wait
until the entire building was
searched and all rooms were
evacuated. This was OK, for I
realize that some regulation

somewhere probably requires

that. [...]

After this task was complete, an
officer with a whistle came and
announced that we had to evacu-
ate the building and go outside.
Many of us were in sleep attire,
and the temperature was in the
305. What were they trying to
prove by this stunt, especially if
there were no fire? Lothrop Hall
has had a problem [since] last
year (as far as I know) of repeat-
ed pranks involving the fire
alarm. is this some sortrof way to
slap everyone’s wrist for some-
one else’s stupidity?

Too little holiday cheer

I am a freshman at Pitt, and I
am adjusting very well to the big
city atmosphere. I have noticed
a very wide majority of the stu-
dents and professors [having] a
very negative attitude toward this
university.  But the ‘one thing
that has upset me the most since
I've been here was the article in
the Perspective section of The Pitt
News. The so—called ”author”
was Mario Oliverio, and the title
was ”The only thing more
depressing than Christmas...”
Although he did point out seve-
ral valid points which are true
[about] Thanksgiving, I believe
many of his ideas were trash, ut-
ter garbage. I would seriously
reconsider what kind of staff The
Pitt News is incorporating.

If this article gave others the
same feeling that it gave me, it
just reinforces the idea of how
impersonal and warped a big col-
lege can be. This article was not
just in bad taste, it was offensive.
[...]

 Thanks for giving me that lit-
tle bit of ”holiday cheer”!

A number of things to remember about the past year

that may be fun to ponder. We
are thankful for:

The Christmas season is upon
us, and soon enough we'll all be

gathered around fireplaces, toast-
ing the new year and the accom-
plishments of the onegjust past.

But while you're downing your
ninth eggnog or sucking face un-
der the mistletoe, take a moment

 

 

MATTE
MARTIN

to reflect upon the past year at the
University of Pittsburgh and all
the things we have to be thank-
ful for.

Here's just a small sampling

0 The generosity of a kindly
janitor, hoping to save the univer-
sity a few bucks by underwriting
enough custodial supplies to
keep your average beer drinker
wrapped in toilet paper for life.

0 Athletic Director Ed Bozik,
who had enough common sense
to say that he might turn down a
Gator Bowl bid for the football
team if it were offered. After all,
the idea of major college football
is to have fun, not make money
for your respective university,
right?

0 The SOD.

0 Kent Baldauf, for having
enough courage to step forth and
run for SGB president, even
though he knew the odds were
against him.

0 Jay Katz, for purposefully
serving his community and estab-
lishing a new, radical, three-
member organization every other
day. Thanks for the letters, Jay.

0 Al B. Sure, Keith Sweat and
The .Boys.

0 The emergence of Bubby
Brister as the Steelers quarterback
of the '90s.

0 The fascination of Bono as a
Christ figure.

0 J. Danforth Quayle.

0 The PPC, for allowing 2,000-

people into the David Lawrence
Auditorium lobby, but only
1,000 in to see a movie. It does
get kind of cold outside anyway,
doesn't it?

0 The Pirates for re—signing All-
Star Gary Redus to a $1 million
deal as the club's fifth outfielder.

0 The Butthole Surfers.

0 The Luna.

0 Wine coolers.

0 The elevators in the Student
Union.

0 The new registration process
in Thackeray Hall.

0 The rain cloud that likes to
watch Pitt football more than the
fans do.

0 The return of Michael Jack-
son. He’s so damn Bad, I want to
cry.
0 Oprah's dietician.

0 The sculpture in Forbes
Q

Quad.

0 Guys who wear muscle shirts
in the winter so women can see
the provocative stretch marks on
their shoulders.

0 Fraternities, for making sure
there are no misunde_rstandings
as to who sits where during foot.-
ball games. v

0 James Rocco, the official
hairdresser of the Pitt cheer-
leaders.

0 The Pitt Pine.

0 Those loveable Hoopies.

0 The WPTS AM radio broad-
casts of Lady Panther basketball

games. _
0 The SGB ca|l—in talk show.
0 People who air—guitar
LaGrange.

- 0 The ultimate wisdom of Mor-
ton Downey Jr.

0 The disappearance of Zippy
the Pinhead. '

0 The amazing ease with
which one can receive financial
aid.

0 That Judge Wapner is still
capable of passing judgement at
the age of I23...

0 Nine a.m. classes. Get ’em
out of the way.
0 The .Y—97 condom ditty.
0 Weekend reading days.

0 Edye and Mike.

0 Foreign T.A.s.

0 Geraldo Rivera's new nose.

0 The new Duran Duran
album.

0 Tom Jones’ remix of Prince's
Kiss.

0 That clean smell in C.J.’s af-
ter a few pitchers of beer have
been spilled on the floor.

0 Button-fly jeans during a hard
night of drinking.

0 People who mumble.
0 D.J. Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh
Pnnce.
0 Remote Control.
0 Re—heated ‘O’ fries.

Here's hoping that the Steelers
draft a punter this year!

Bantering about some of the current TV commercials

STAF: Today, I was driving in
my car, and I heard a commercial
for this bank. It said, ”To get a
loan, call toll free, 1-800--
525-LOAN. That number again,
I-800-525-L-O-A-N." I thought, if
you can't spell loan, you can't get
a loan.

JESS: That's not even close to
what I saw last night on TV It was
a commercial for a toilet bowl
cleaner that had these toilets sing-
ing ”Duke of Earlz" Where are
our morals Staf—O?

STAF: I ask myself the same

question, especially when we ~

have a commercial on TV that
sells a product by showing us a
grandma falling down the steps
with her head bouncing off of the
banister. I can just see some
‘director shouting, "OK, grandma,
take 36. And this time take a run-
ning leap at those steps. What? I
don't care if your pelvis is broken,
I want this done today.”

JESS: Oh yeah, I love that one. A

Poor ol' blue-haired dear. What
about the one where there's this
geriatric woman in bed who
claps her hands and all of her
lights go out? My question is:
What if she belched in the mid-
dle of the night? Would the lights
come on?

STAF: Good question. How

If we don't open our eyes, how

I've tried warm milk, cheap
brandy and counting sheep, but
sleeping is still a challenge to me.

In the past, a soft pillow and a
warm blanket were the two
things I could always count on.
It's not that easy anymore.

My roommates say that it's
merely stress. My parents recom-
mend that I eat more fruit. I usual-
ly just «end up watching
television. '

Cable TV is a slight comfort
when the clock strikes 3 a.m.
When everything appears empty
outside, I can always find people
who want to talk to me through

about the one for Efferdent den-
ture cleanser? There's this guy sit-
ting is his easy chair watching TV
and his wife is walking up the
stairs behind him. He looks back
at her and says, ”Every night my

power tools to good use.”
JESS: How ’bout the little kid
sitting in a high chair with his lit-
tle airplane full of food? All of a
sudden, he knocks it off his tray
and it lands on the carpet. If I

wife goes upstairs into the
bathroom. She doesn't say what
she's doing up there, and it sure
doesn't take long, but whatever
it is, it sure makes her feel good.”
I just feel like saying, ”Think
about it, pal. You think maybe
she has a 18-year-old Pitt fresh-
man stashed up in the closet? Or
sir, does the TV get fuzzy for
those 15 minutes that she's up
there? ’Cause it's my guess that
she's finally putting some of your

a bright screen. However, as days
go by, my audio-visual friends
only seem to say the same things.

As a psychology major, I've
pondered the possible causes of

depressed, paranoid or
schizophrenic. My life holds no
major hardships or tragedies. I'm

were that kid's mother I'd proba-
bly be seen the next day on all
the TV stations because I sold my
kid to Bio-desicision Laboratories
for $150. Hey, he was a non-
smoker. .

STAF: How about the ad for
Hills department stores? They ad-
vertise themselves as ”no risk
shopping.” Does this -mean I
don't have to wear a condom
when I go there?

JESS: What about that dwarf

Some nights my bed feels like
an oven, and I try cooling off with
a walk around Oakland. Though
the streets may not be particular-
ly safe, the absence of apparent
life is somewhat soothing. Things

are clear at night when the only V

activity comes from stray cats
ducking under parked cars.
There's nothing to do but look
around. When I return, it's easi-_
er to shut my eyes.

Unfortunately, the nights I
manage to sleep through never
live up to my expectations.

I don't seem to dream any-
more. I used to be able to retain

they have doing their Christmas
ads? What is it, left over from the
bar scene in Star Wars? Maybe
you better wear that condom,
Staf—O, with that thing running
around the store.

STAF: I like all of the ads that
they run during the afternoon.
Commercials for the Pittsburgh
Institute for Coloring Inside the
Lines, or the college for loboto—
my students. I guess they think
that if you're home watching Be-
witched, you're desperate
enough to try anything.

JESS: There's this one for
Tropicana orange juice with this
girl walking through an orange
orchard. She says, ”You know,
when I was a girl, I would be out
in this orange orchard all day. I'd
come home with orange nails
and sticky chin, and Mom would
put me right in the tub." I think
that _this girl's mom is being
generous. I know, regardless of
where I was all day, if I came
home with a sticky chin, Mom

would put me right out of the .

house.

STAF: My favorite commercial

is a local one. It's for Sheetz hot ‘

dogs. I swear, it's a cheap porno
flick. There's this girl and she's all
dressed and made up and she's
talking about what else — hot
dogs. But before she talks about
these dogs, she talks about the
toppings for these dogs. She says,

”They put ’em on top. They put
’em on top for ya. Sheetz top‘-
pings, thick, rich, spicy, fiesty.”
By this time, Jess, I've made my
own topping for this hot dog.
Then, if that's not enough, she
holds this hot dog up in front of
her face, opens her ruby-red lips,
slowly slides it in, then BITES
THE END OFF OF IT! Talk about
pain!

Just being alive in Pittsburghcan be quitea hassle

Hassle, hassle, hassle. Did you
ever notice that wherever you go,
whatever you do at this place,
you'll find a hassle? Seriously.
Everything is a hassle. I under-
stand that rules must be followed,
guidelines must be adhered to,
and that security is a must, but
this place is ridiculous.

KAREN

  SPEECE

I can't even relax in my own
room without first flashing an ID
to a security guard who wouldn't
know me from Adam anyway but
dutifully opens the door so that
I may embark on another step of
the adventure through the maze
to my room. — ,

The elevator. You wait forever
and three years for the silly thing
to come, and then it only takes
you to the floor below the one
you live on. I can fully under-
stand this, though, because if it
stopped on every floor, it would
take about seven years to get up
and down. I guess that's why
God let steps be invented first. It's
pretty sad when they are a quick-
er means of transport than an
elevator. , , ,.

Z.':I .1:-ﬁn ."'»€‘\ A”

After the adventure on the ele-
vator, I am forced to unlock a
security door to even get to a set
of stairs. This is security, I know.
You've got to admit, it's a big
hassle, especially with a load of
laundry.‘

Only after all of these security
hassles can I relax in the comfort
of my ”|uxury estate.”

Have you ever tried to replace
a burnt-out light bulb in your
room? Forget it. Unless you have
some kind of supernatural pow-
er, or the silly tool that pries the
thing open, you're wasting your
time, because you can't even get
to the bulb. Down to the main
desk for the ever—popular main-
tainance request form. Wait six or
seven working days and voila!
lights appear again.

I can't even call out for a pizza
without a hassle or two. First, I
have to dial 91, then the number.
and an access code before I can
even talk to the pizza shop. Half
an hour later, I have to go down
to the lobby to get the silly thing.
So much for ”delivered to your
door.” Then, after all of this, it's
cold by the time you get it back
to the room anyway. Hassle.

Speaking of access codes, have
you ever tried to pay.your phone

bill at the STS office? What a
pain. Talk about a mega—hassle.
After I spend half a month figur-
ing out where in the quad it is,
I get up to the window only find
a rude receptionist who says,
”We’re not accepting payments
today."

Just when I think I've finally got
the STS system down’ pat, they go
and change the location of the
office. I thought hide—and—seek
ended in elementary school. I
guess I was wrong. Hassle.

Everyone's got to eat, right?
Why is the cafeteria such a has-
sle then? I get down there only to
stand in a long line for some item
I don't even recognize as food.
When it's my turn to be served,
I can't even have what I want
anyway, so why do they hassle
me by asking?

After the major compromise of
the red glob for the tan one, I try
to find a seat. Any empty seat is
just bound to be ”saved." This is
such a waste, because by the time
the people who are saving. the
seat get out of line, I could have
my meal eaten and be out of
there. I guess these supposedly
educated people don't realize
that.

. Just when I thought I had the

/

whole system down, I was mis-
taken. It came time to schedule
classes for the next term.

Anxiously, I went to the
Cathedral of Learning to get a
course description guide, but I
had to go to Thackeray for a time
schedule. You need both of
them, so why don't they just put
the silly things in the same place?
Do they think that we students
have nothing better to do with
our time than to go running all
over the university finding things?
Hassle.

Once I do decide to acquire
these items, I go to myroom and
sit staring blankly at them. Do I
actually want to endure another
semester? Nevertheless, I make
out a schedule.

Finally, I meet with an adviser,
assumed schedule in hand, ready
for anything that may come my
way. I willingly hand my adviser
my schedule, assuming only the
best until he laughs hysterically.
I fail to see the humor. All I want

_is 19 credits.» I'm not asking for a

new Porsche or anything, just a
verification.

He does, however allow me to
take 18 credits, ifl get the dean's
approval. Hassle, hassle, hassle.
If a kid wants 18 credits, more

power to her. At least, this is what F

I thought.

I march over triumphantly to
the dean's office where a recep-
tionist sends me to asecretary
who rummages through three
drawers of files before it occurs
to her to ask me if I'm a freshman.
When I tell her that I am indeed,
she informs me that I can not
have the 18 credits I desire. I
guess there's more than one defi-
nition of ”freshman 15." I didn't
even get to talk to the dean.

Not at all a happy camper, I
trudge over to Thackeray to veri-
fy what's left of my class sched-
ule. The receptionist rips the
paper out of my hand, and tells
me to have a seat.

After the tremendous wait is
over, an adviser—type person calls
my name, and within 20 seconds,
tells me that I can have the class-
es I want. If it only took her 20
seconds, why did Ihave to wait
two hours? Hassle.

When I graduate, I'm con-
vinced that I’ll be able to handle
anything. I think I'll become the
first female president and put
foolproof, hassle—proof plans into
action. Yeah, right.

Continued from page 9

They maintain the basic guitar-
chord-amp chain, shunning wire-
less units, to make the most of in-
cidental noise. Thurston and Lee
sometimes lodge screwdrivers
under the strings as a second
bridge, banging them with drum-
sticks, or sliding a metal bottle-
neck over the pickups. The fact
that the guitars are so trashy is
also responsible for their trade-
mark sound.

Each of the 20—or—so guitars
they have on stage has its own in-
dividual malfunctions alon with

 

   

a designated tuning. Guitarist Lee
Ranaldo, in a recent interview,
told ofa guitar on which he acci-
dently fixed a loose wire and
couldn't ”un—fix. To lose a gui-
tar,” he said, ”is to lose a song.”

But though Sonic Youth pumps
out plenty of feedback and white
noise, their steady backbeat and
liquid riffs illuminate a possible
industrial tag. The next two
records, Bad Moon Rising, for
Homestead with drummer Bob
Bert, and EVOL, on SST with
Steve Shelley behind the kit, es-
tablished them solidly on the
middle ground between noise
and underground pop.

Bad Moon Rising plays like
one long song, the only silent
spaces being between the two
sides and before the last song, a
single, ”Death Valley ’69,”

Where Bad Moon evolved and
flowed, EVOL had definite songs.
”Starpower” and ”Shadow of a
Doubt” are particulary beautiful,
if not frighteningly so. The album
broke Sonic Youth into wider ra-
dio accessibility, harnessing all
their experimental headiness and
punk energy into a shorter, tight-
er pop song format.

1987's Sister, on SST, brought
even more popularity to the
band. Its 10 songs all vary, from
Kim's noisy ballad ”Beauty Lies
in the Eye” and Thurston and
Kim's duet ”Kotten Krown” to the

all—out sonic rush of ”White

All in all, Sister is nearly a perfect
record with their verse—chorus-

freakout-verse—chorus format
benefiting from dynamic
production.

The Youth proved worthy of all
the acclaim they've been lauded
with this year's double album
Daydream Nation. Released on
Blast First and distributed by Enig-
ma, the new disc pulls no
punches. It doesn't necessarily
mark a huge progression in style,
but simply provides more Sonic
Youth at their peak. It also

Though a double album, there
are only fourteen songs on

extended freakouts. In this way,
a song can evolve or switch its
face, as on Bad Moon Rising,
simply because it is longer than
ones on other records.

The record's songs range from
up—beat quick to recklessly fast;
absent are the slower, moody
pieces. But Thurston’s downtown
acid—adventures like ”Eric5s Trip”
and ”The Wonder” are all the
more prominent as Kim's icy wail
reaches a new peak on ”Kissibi|-
ity” and ”Cross the Breeze.”

All in all, Daydream Nation is
Sonic Youth as you thought they
were, revealing few new facets of
their personality. But the quality
of its production, the rush of its
noise, and the Utter size of its
scope reconfirm Sonic Youth as
one of the most unique and
powerfulbands today.

Eastwood's portrait of Charlie Parker soars

By Dmitri Ragano
Staff Writer

The musical genius who dies in
his prime has always been sub-
ject to posthumous fascination,
whether it be Jimi Hendrix or
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Sax
player Charlie ”Bird” Parker
lived a legend, died from drug
abuse at age 34, and today com-
mands an influence in jazz that
can only be rivaled by Coltrane
and a handful of others.

Clint Eastwood admired him so
much he decided to make a
movie about this Orpheus of bop.

Bird is more than just another
portrait of the artist as a young

dope fiend. It is Eastvvood’s labor
of love, an engaging, beautiful
film which captures Parker's rise
and fall with abundant skill an
warmth. -

Forest Whitaker won the Best -

Actor Award at Cannes for his
role as Parker, and it's not hard
to believe. The performance is
nothing short of a tour de force.
You may not have noticed
Whitaker's previous work; he
was Robin Williams’ sidekick in
Good Morning Vietnam, and like
every other black actor on the
continent, he appeared in a ”Hill
Street Blues” episode.

Bird propels him to the fore-
front of today's talent. His mas-

sive face and frame, steered by
small, shiny eyes, are reminiscent
of Rod Steiger’s. But the power
with which he commands this
mass is quite unique. He's a vast
wet-eyed mountain of flesh and
fury. Every little wheeze or
tremor on his lips makes you an-
ticipate him erupting. You know
you're in the hands of a master.

The supporting cast is strong,
particularly Diane Venora as his
wife Chan. But Eastwood always
keeps the spotlight on Bird and
lets him soar.

Eastwood's pacing avoids the

dreamy discombobulation that
made parts of the jazz film Round
Midnight seem as improvised as
the music. The photography is
even more impressive, with its
chiaroscuros of shiny brass and
sweating faces.

Plenty of little visual epiphanies
turn up again and again. A cym-
bal flies through the air, a saxo-
phone sinks into water, a
cigar-chomping dope dealer rolls
his wheelchair towards the
camera.

The film is a good synthesis of
Bird the legend, and Bird the

man. Parker may be a god for
jazz fans today, but for the mus-
ic industry he was just another
commodity on a leash. When
Parker is desperate for money,
Dizzy Gillespie (Sam Wright)
tells him that big business ”likes
it when the nigger turns out un-
reliable.”

Bird is chock full of telling lines
like this. The better moments do
outshine the whole, but the
craftsmanship and story easily
keep the film going. It can be
recommended for movie lovers
as well as jazz buffs.

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, December 8, I988

Seven bands at Alternative /am

By Joan Kane
Staff Writer

Local band manager and
promoter Mike Whited knows a
good thing when he sees it.

Way back when, when he
lived in Nashville, Tenn., he was
exposed to Volunteerjam. It was
an annual event featuring The
Charlie Daniels Band and a host
of other performers.

"Rednecks from all around
would travel to see Charlie play.
He'd have some good bands
there with him too. Another lo-
cal promoter saw this and decid-
ed to put on his own show — an
alternative jam. The concept be-
hind it was to get six or seven
bands together for a reduced
cover charge.

"They always made a point of
bringing in a band no one had
heard of, to give them some ex-

posure,” Whited explained.

These jams became quite
popular, as did some of their per-
formers. For example, Jason and
the Scorchers, John Hiatt, The
Georgia Satellites and Let's Ac-
tive all played at these jams at
one time or another.

The basis of the shows was not
to make money, but rather to ex-
pose more people to more music.

Whited is implementing that
idea here in Pittsburgh. On Satur-
day, Dec. 17, Alternative Jam 3
will be held at Graffiti. Five local
bands: Next President, Pontius Pi-
late and the Nail Driving Five,
Thin White Line, 11th Hour and
The Cynics will be performing at
the over—21 show. The cover
charge for the show has been
slashed drastically in an effort to
draw more attention to the music.

The first two alternative jams
that Whited produced were suc-

I If Metropol Is A Swell Place To Go
After School.

cessful, and Whited hopes that
this one will do even better.

"The theory behind Alternative
Jam," Whited stated,"|s that mus-
ic, being like heroin, is an addic-
tion. When you see a band, and
you like them, you'll want to
come back and see them again.
And you won't mind paying for
it."

People tend to complain about
the cover charges at most clubs.
What Whited stressed, and what
most don't realize, is that the
money made at shows goes back
into the music.

"It's not so that the singer can
buy a Porsche. It's so they can
make an album or a tape or a 45.
It goes to cover the cost of adver-
tising. Nobody in the local mus-
ic scene makes any money from
it,” Whited said.

Whited booked a solid line-up
for the Alternative Jam. It's a bill
filled with diverse styles and
sounds.

Next President is a new band
that hails from Indiana, Pa.

"Shawn [Harrison, lead singer
from 11th Hour] saw them per-
form in Indiana and thought they
were a great live band. I heard a
tape and they sounded good.

We're going to give them a little‘

exposure here, now,” he said.

Pontius Pilate and the Nail
Driving Five are probably better
known by their alter ego —— Dead-
ly By Desire. They put on a fun
show covering "dance-metal"
tunes.

"People may have taken them
the wrong way,” Whited said.
"What Mark [Fern, vocalist and
guitarist of Deadly By Desire] is
showing is that they don't always
take themselves so seriously.
They put on a great show. They
cover The Godfathers and Iggy
Pop, stuff like that. They chill out
and have a good time.”

Thin White Line is a band that
sounds like no other. They're
powerful and full of energy. Ac-
cording to Whited, "Bob Porter
[lead singer] is a great performer.
This band has come a long way.
A while back they gave me a
tape, and it was terribly horrible,
but Tim [Dunleavy, guitar] under-
stood when I told him what I
thought.

"He kept after me to come see
them. I finally did and they were
great. It was my mistake to just
judge them by that first demo
tape. They've really developed
and they put on a fantastic
show.”

11th Hour may strike some as
being out of place on this bill, but
Whited disagreed.

"l'm their manager; that's why
they're on there,” he joked. "Ac—
tually, they're probably the most
misunderstood band in Pitts-
burgh. Some people think of
them as some sort of pop band —
pop like Let's Active or R.E.M.
Their new stuff is more power-
chord oriented and more straight-
ahead rock." Look for their new
album in January.

The Cynics are a Pittsburgh sta-
ple. Whited called them a "100
percent ‘professional, great
band.” While their music, with its
strong '60s influence, is accessi-
ble to a certain group of people,
it is safe to say that they aren't
limiting themselves in any way.
Live, they are very powerful,
energetic and entertaining.

The Heretics and Barbed
Wired Dolls will play the all ages
show which will kick off the
evening at 7 p.m.

and it paid off. Much of the fun
in listening to Human Music
comes from the unexpected turns

many of the groups play. When
Yo La Tengo tears ferociously

this LPs highlights. Plus Human

low price. The CD is only $8; th

Lest it be damned by too
sweeping praise, Human Music
does have its shortcomings. (Even
the Bible has less—interesting
books, though, right?) Some ex-
cellent bands just don't come
across well in the tracks offered.
Salem 66's ”Red Barn” is a prime
example: a slow, churning song
devoid of the great vocal and mu-
sical interplay Judy Grunwald
and Beth Kaplan usually share.
Volcano Suns’ ”Ultravixen” is
pretty much just a noisy toss-off.
But then again, Homestead is
all about taking chances and so
is Human Music. It's unrealistic
to think there won't be something
here that will turn somebody off,
but this record has far more
potential to offer adventurous
listeners the chance to hear a lot
of exciting young bands. Human

noted as loud, powerful and
mildly outspoken, and he hasn't

First doing solo work, and now

. with his current gang, the Rollins

Band, Henry has continuosly
produced nothing short of musi-
cal mayhem.

Do It! is the latest masterpiece
of mutilation from the Rollins
Band, and all the potency of the
Rollins’ genre is instilled on it.

All the guys from the last LP,
Life Time, are still around, includ-
ing Andrew (bass), Simeon Cain
(drums), Chris Haskett (guitar),
and Rollins (vocals).

Side one contains three covers,
”Do It!” being the unequalled
king of the bunch. Henry screams

on this cut like a banshee on a
search for souls. Severe physical
action presses heavily on your
mind.

Side two has six songs record-
ed live in Holland in 1987. Even
if there's nothing new here, live
Rollins is certainly fierce. Songs
like ”Followed Around,”
”Wreckage,” and ”Hot Animal
Machine,” while old favorites,
take on new vigor through Hen-
ry's dynamic live stage presence.

So what if there's not an inkling
of new material on the whole al-
bum; there’s enough mean ener-
gy to incite the most passive into
an excited, violent frenzy.

Don't think about buying this
album, Do It!

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, December 8, 1988

beginning in 1982. The band
placed itself in the Irish limelight
with their first 12-inch single,
”Rhythm Method.”

The Fountainhead’s debut al-
bum The Burning Touch and its
subsequent American tour
brought the band's simple, direct

rock ’n’ roll to an entirely new au-

dience.

The 1988 release, Voice of
Reason brandishes a refreshing
and imaginative look at moody,
powerful emotions. The Foun-
tainhead has found the knack for
producing tense, rhythmic, full-
of-feeling songs.

”Someone Like You,” which

received minimal airplay on the
now defunct WXXP, is probably
the most representative of Voice
of Reason’s melancholy theme.

’’Still Dreaming,” and ”The
Rain Came Down,” expound
upon the album's dreary textures,
opening up new venues for
gloomy mentality.

It's refreshing to find a passive
way to vent your frustrations, and
Voice of Reason allows you to do
just that. Depression is an ever-
present aspect of life and The
Fountainhead presents an overt
method of sifting through the
jumble.

THE PITT NEWS

By Chris Bosak
Staff Writer

Pitt swimmer Laure Walczak,
now a junior, would like to for-
get her dismal sophomore season
and return to the All—American
status she obtained her freshman
year

_ ”She didn't have a very good
year last year,” said Pitt women's
swimming coach David Belo-
wich. ”This year she's got some-
thing to prove, and l think more
than anything else, she has to
prove it to herself.”

Judging from her impressive
performances in the pool so far
this year, another All-American
year does not seem unrealistic.

In the Pitt invitational held last
week, Walczak scored points in

eight events, including all four of
the relay events.

”So far she's having a great sea-
son. Actually, she is ahead of
where she was her freshman
year. As the year progresses, I

‘ thing she'll contribute even more

than she already has,” added Be-
lowich.

Which is saying a lot, consider-
ing the outstanding freshman year
Walczak had.

She was part of two school
record teams that year and also
earned All-American honors. Her
records were set in the 200
freestyle relay and ‘200 medley
relay events. The 200 freestyle
team, consisting of Walczak, Su-
san Hickman, Cindy Rose and
Tracy Pfister was also All-
American.

’’I was really excitedabout the
records,” said Walczak. ’’I never
thought I'd come in my freshman
year and accomplish something
like that.”

Actually, relays seem to be
somewhat of a specialty for Walc-
zak. Her times are up to a full sec-
ond faster in her relay legs than
in her individual events.

”| always know when I put
Laure in a relay she's going to
give it her physical 1 10 percent,”
said coach Belowich. ’’I know it's
somewhat of a cliche in sports,
but it's important to give 110 per-
cent, and Laure does.”

Another reason for her impres-
sive relay performances is her
team—oriented spirit. She has a lot
of friends on the team and
doesn’t hesitate to lend a hand or

to encourage a teammate after a
poor performance.

”Laure is a very giving person.
She is a tremendous team per-

” said Belowich. ”She’s
quiet, [but] you don't have to be
the cheerleader—type to be a team
person, and Laure is definitely a
team person."

Although the modest Walczak
won't admit it, she is becoming,
in her own way, a leader for the
young Pitt women's swim team.

’’I don't see myself as a leader,”
said Walczak. ”l just try to do the
best I can, and cheer the other
girls on.”

Belowich sees it a different
way.

”Through hard work and con-
centration, Laure is really becom-
ing a leader for some of the

Record-setting Walczak now back on track J

freshmen on the team,” said Be-
lowich. ,

Wa|czak’s good friend and
teammate, Sandy Aibright, also a
junior, agrees more with Be-
lowich.

’’It’s nice to see Laure swim-
ming well again,” said Albright.
”She has come back from last
year and turned into a real inspi-
ration for the other girls.”

But will this season's success
continue?

”Hopefully it will,” said Walc-
zak. ’’If I keep doing what I've

been doing, my times should‘

come down a little bit. My main
goal is to make NCAA cuts.”
Walczak said the high expec-
tations coming from her freshman
year contributed to her poor sec-

Gearing up
Holiday contests  
‘challenge young

Panther squad

;~ It wasn't always like this. The
Sienas, the Jacksonvilles —‘ they
never seemed to pose a problem
for the Pitt basketball team, at
least not for the last two years.

But those were the Smith—Lane-
Gore years. These are the days of
Matthews-Miller-Martin—Shorter,
and the Panthers admit that they
cannot afford to take any team
lightly.

With a holiday schedule that
includes West Virginia, Florida,
Northwestern and potentially Ar-
izona, the Pitt players are not tak-
ing anything for granted as they
prepare for their Big East opener
against Syracuse on Jan. 4.

”lt’s better for us, being a
young team, to play a tough'pre—
Big East schedule,” said sopho-
more guard Jason Matthews, who
carried Pitt to an 81-74 victory
over Jacksonville Tuesday night
with a career—high 34-point per-
formance.

Matthews and Paul Evans, the
Pitt coach, both said that the Pan-
thers cannot look past unranked
teams if‘t'hey wish to succeed this
season.

”We try and make every game

the same,” Evans said.

' Success in the cards for college football teams  

On the playing field, college
football is simply a game — 22
uniformed men, two goal lines,
100 yards of grass and a leather
ball. The stakes, for the players,
are wins and losses, and maybe
on a good year, an all-expenses
paid trip to the Fiesta Bowl.

But off the field, college foot-
ball is also what one could be in-
clined to calla game.

For a school to have a success-
ful program on the field, it must
also ’'play’’ according to a set of

But every game will not be the
same. The Mountaineers come to
Fitzgerald Field House this Satur-
day night with only a 2-2 record,
but holding their opponents to an
average of 65.5 points and 33.3
rebounds per game.

And for WVU, this will be one
of the biggest games of the year,
the continuation of an ongoing
rivalry with Pitt. 7

”Really, it's the same team that
they had last year, plus some
players, plus a year's ex-
perience,” Evans said.

The 1987-88 Mountaineer
squad pressed the Top Ten-
ranked Panthers and led by three
at the half, but the highly touted
Pitt freshman class rallied to give

, Pitt a 70-64 victory.

Bobby Martin sank four free
throws in the final 1:19, and Mat-
thews addeda season-high 19
points.

The ’Eers return starting guards
Herbie Brooks and Steve Berger,
as well as forwards Chris Brooks
and Darryl Prue. Attempting to
shore up the center position is
6-foot—1 0 Cleveland State transfer
Ray Foster. 8

”He’s real big,” Evans said of
Foster. ”They expect him to be a
big defensive player for them.”

smart guidelines, which makes
the business a game of sorts. Play
the cards right, and you can be
a winner, just like the Oklahomas
and Michigans of the world.

If not, well, downtrodden Pur-
due and abysmal Kansas can tell
you what it's like near or at the
bottom.

This game, on the coach's part,
involves recruiting, convincing
schoolboy stars that his universi-
ty and football program is the best
place for them to practice their

talents.

It also involves teaching his
players to win in a better fashion
than the coaches of the teams on
his schedule does.

But the university itself must
play a game,_one of promoting.

tion to field a winning program.

For the stakes are much, much

too high not to.

A successful football program
translates simply into money;
cold, hard cash. Instant liqui-
dation.

On game day alone, the
university receives cash flow
from ticket sales, concession
sales, souvenir sales and if the
game is on the tube, like so many
are nowadays, the television
networks.

If the boosters are happy, they

Brookin struggling through slump

By Matt Martin
Sports Editor

Rod Brookin is back. Or at least
back on the playing floor.

The 6—foot—6 Brookin was
declared academically ineligible
for the 1988 Big East season, but
has since returned to the hard-
court for Pitt and is averaging 25
minutes of playing time per
game, starting two of four games
at small forward.

But Brookin hasn't lived up to
the promise of his freshman sea-
son, when he averaged 10.2
points and "four rebounds and
was named to the Big East All-

Freshman team.

Brookin is averaging only 7.8
points and 3.3 rebounds. His
shooting has become erratic, as
evidenced '7y his percentages —
34.3 percent from the floor
(12-35), 23.1 percent from the
free throw line (3-13).

Brookin, who bulked up to 268
pounds earlier this season, is now
down to approximately 238, but
Pitt coach Paul Evans said that the
extra weight may not be the
problem.

”The weight wouldn't cause
him to miss foul shots,” Evans
said. ”lt’s mental.”

Brookin has been attempting to
regain his mental toughness by

focusing on basketball and
school, according to. Evans.
Brookin has also refused to grant
interviews to the media.

But Brookin has come through
for the Panthers in departments
other than scoring. He leads the
team in steals with six and has
two blocked shots.

”He’s been playing good
defense,” Evans said. ’’In the
past, he was a detriment.”

Point guard Sean Miller, for
one, hopes that Brookin’s offense
comes around.

’’If we didn't have Rod on this
team, our chances of making the
NCAAS are slim,” Miller said.

Tennessee
women ’s basketball

By Mel Greenberg

For The Associated Press

The nationwide panel of 60

coaches were in unanimous
agreement that unbeaten Ten nes-
see, 4-O, is the No. 1 team for the
third straight week in the As-
sociated Press women’s basket-
ball poll announced Tuesday.

The consensus of the voters

was that everything else had to be
changed after seven teams from
last week's poll suffered losses —
five of them to unranked teams.

As a result, five new teams are

on the list this week — three of
them for the first time in many
years. Three other teams have
been ousted.

Louisiana State, which

celebrated the 25th—year career
anniversary of Coach Sue Gunter
with an upset of then—No. 2 Long
Beach State, re-entered the poll at
16th, after a week's absence.

South Carolina, 3-0, which last

appeared five years ago in
November 1983, entered at 19th.

Three other teams tied for 20th.

Colorado, 5-O, off to one of its
best starts, ended a six-year ab-
sence. Illinois State, 3-2, bumped
off previous No. 14 Southern Cal
and previous No. 17 Ohio State
at the Buckeyes’ tournament last
weekend to re-enter the list for
the first time in seven years.

Stephen F. Austin, 5-O, also tied

for 20th, which marked the first
appearance for Coach Gary
Blair's team since the final vote

is tops in

second to ninth. Georgia, 4-O,
moved into the No. 2 spot with
1,119 points, followed by Loui-
siana Tech, 4-1, with 1,064
points, Auburn, 3-0, with 1,027
points and Stanford, 4-0, with
951 points.

It was the first-ever appearance
for the Cardinals in the Top Five.

The Top 10 was completed by
Mississippi, which moved up to
sixth from eighth, Virginia, 4-0,
which jumped from 10th to
seventh; Texas, 3-1, which
moved up a spot to ninth; and
Western Kentucky, 4-0, which
moved from 12th to 10th to reach
the upper half of the poll for the
first time in two years.

Iowa, 3-2, which was upset by
host Kansas 67-63 in the title
game of the Jayhawks’ tourna-
ment, fell out of the Top 10 from
seventh to 11th.

”I think it’s great for the sport
to see the new faces and some of
the old timers, like ourselves,
return to the poll,” said Illinois
State coach Jill Hutchison. ”It just
isn't good when only a couple of
teamsdominate. All these upsets
are really making itfun.”

”We’re excited,” said Colora-
do coach Ceal Barry. ’’When I_

saw that Illinois State had beaten .

those teams, I thought we had a
shot, considering our win over
them last week.

NEW YORK -— Auburn’s
Tracy Rocker, the No. 1 play-
er on the nation's No. 1 defen-
sive unit, fought off two
offensive linemen Wednesday
and won the 43rd annual Out-

interior lineman.

The 6—foot-3, 278-pound
senior tackle said he was
”shocked” when he was an-
nounced as the winner over
Michigan State tackle Tony

Mandarich and Pitt guard
Mark Stepnoski ”because I've
been double—teamed all year
by offensive linemen and right
now I have two offensive line-
men next to me.

”It means a whole lot to me
because I can sit here and
think about the times [when]
I made some sacrifices and
gave up some things because
I wanted to have something
special. I think right now it
paid off.”

Auburn led the nation this
season in scoring defense, to-

points and 218.1 and 63.2
yards a game. Rocker made
101 tackles, including 13 be-
hind the line plus five quarter-
back sacks. His 354 career
tackles are the most by any
lineman in Auburn history.

”When you get to this lev-
el, it's the inner strength that
makes the difference between

coach Pat Dye.

Lemieux leads All-Star balloting wa.CZ,,,._

MONTREAL (AP) — Pittsburgh
center Mario Lemieux continues
to lead the fan balloting for the
Wales Conference team for the
NHL All-Star Game, while Que-
.bec’s Michel Goulet has vaulted
into first place for the starting left
wing spot.

Figures released on Tuesday by
the league showed Lemieux, the

‘ son's All-Star

most valuable player in last sea-
Game, with

118,926 votes.

Goulet, who had been in third
place last week among the left
wings, climbed past Montreal's
Mats Naslund and New Jersey's
Aaron Broten with 46,399 votes.
Naslund remained second, with

39,792 votes, and Broten

dropped from first to third with '

34,573.

The leaders at the other posi-
tions were Boston’s Cam Neely
at right wing, Boston's Ray Bour-
que and Pittsburgh's Paul Coffey
at defense and New Jersey's Sean
Burke in goal.

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, December 8, I988

Bourque, who had 103,838
votes, and Lemieux were the only
players to receive at least
100,000 votes so far.

The All-Star Game, between
the Wales Conference and Camp-
bell Conference teams, will be
played Feb. 7 at Edmonton, Al-
berta. Fan balloting ends Jan. 1.

Faust came to Notre Dame
straight from the incredibly suc-
cessful preps program he created
at Cincinnati's Moeller High
School. It was a bit ofa gamble
for Notre Dame, but Faust fit the
image it was looking for. He was
enthusiastic, deeply religious, a
fine speaker and motivator, and,
although his only coaching ex-
perience was at the high school
level, Faust was a winner.

And so during his tenure at the
school, Faust didn’t totally disap-
point. He was enthusiastic, reli-

But the one thing he didn't
bring to Notre Dame was enough
victories, let alone any national
championships. Faust went

30-26-1 during his five seasons
with the Irish. A respectable
record for some programs, like
Tulane, Wisconsin and Temple,
but not nearly good enough for

  
 

the kind Notre Dame wanted.

As a result, the school would
have to either dismiss the likable
Faust and possibly sacrifice its in-
tegrity, or continue to embrace
the mediocrity flowing through
its Ii-feblood.

The choice was easier than ex-
pected.

Faust was released, and as a
replacement, officials at the
school simply went out and hired
the best candidate they could
find. Not simply the best availa-
ble candidate, but the best can-
didate. There would be no more
projects, no more toying with the
football program at Notre Dame.

Enter Lou Holtz. From 1977 to
1983, Holtzwas the head coach
at the University of Arkansas,
where he compiled a 60-21-2
record and guided his teams to

six straight bowl appearances, in-
cluding a stunning 31-6 upset of

second-ranked Oklahoma in the
Orange Bowl.
Holtz was hired away by the

University of Minnesota in 1984
to rescue its football program
from the annual incompetence
that had pervaded it. In the two
seasons before Holtz, the
Gophers finished dead last in the
conference.

In his two seasons with the
Gophers, Holtz went 10-12 in the
competitive Big 10, including a
respectable 6-5 and a bowl bid in I
1985. Not great numbers, but a
significant improvement from
rock bottom.

Now Holtz is in his third sea-
son with the Irish, and his team
is undefeated and due to face
West Virginia for the national
championship.

The University of Notre Dame
did what it had to — it played the
game. It wanted to regain its fans
and its respect and the enour-

_mous amounts of money that

come with the two, so it dished
out the dollars and hired compe-
tence, experience and, most im-
portantly, wins.

Minnesota did the same thing
four years ago, but then eventu-
ally lost out to the tradition of
South Bend.

In 1982, Texas A&M was look-
ing to revitalize its Aggies, and

since the arrival of the successful

(and highly paid) Jackie Sherrill
from Pitt, the team has- been a
power in the Southwest Confer-
ence, though not a very honora-
ble one. ,

USC wasn't getting very far
with Ted Tollner at the helm, so
two years ago it plucked the
proven Larry Smith from the
deserts of Arizona; suddenly, the
10-1 Trojans were in the running
for the national championship
until its loss to Notre Dame two
weeks ago.

Purdue was in a similar posi-
tion after it fired the mediocre
Leon Burtnett last year but sold it-
self short in hiring a burnt-out
Fred Akers, who was fi red for his
hand in the decline of the Texas
Longhorns.

”So you're saying the quickest
fix for a broken program is to dish
out a $5 million contract to the
likes of Barry Switzer or Terry
Donahue, and that’ll do it?”

Yep. Ff

Who" says you can't buy ex-
perience?

ond year. Once she started doing
poorly, she got more and more
discouraged, which led to worse
swimming times.

”I wanted to do so much bet-
ter, that I just tried too hard and
got too uptight and nervous. This
year, I'm more relaxed," said
Walczak.

She is also having more fun
with the sport she has been in-
volved in, since she was 6 years
old. She took lessons at the
McKeesport YMCA and joined
their team when she was 8. At
age 12, she joined the Jewish
Community Center team and
swam the 50 freestyle, 100
freestyle, and 100 butterfly
events. She still competes in
those same events, although she
recently added the 200 freestyle
event

Walczak was "also one of the
few bright spots on her East AI-
legheny high school swim team.
She swam in the Pennsylvania
State meet three times and ex-
celled in her junior year. That
was when she met Belowich.

Belowich turned out to be one

of the reasons Walczak chose

Pitt.

”He was really nice and he
seemed like he would take the
time to work with you a Iot,” said
Walczak.

She is happy with her choice
and likes the system Belowich

runs here — except for one thing.

”I don't like getting up at five
o'clock in the morning for prac-
tice,” said Walczak. ”But I like

the team, and knowing that

everyone is putting their effort
into it makes it a lot easier on
you.”

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, December 8,_T988

Pitt

Continued from page 17
But Evans is not in awe of West
Virginia, or of their defensive suc-
cess against Pitt last year.
— ”West Virginia is struggling at

the foul line, struggling with their I

sho.oting,’.’. Evans said.. ."They
haven't gelled yet, and I hope
they don't for another week or
so."

Following West Virginia, the
Panthers play the last of their six-
game home stand against Toledo
on Dec. 17.

The Rockets return four starters
from a 15-12 squad, including
double—figure scorers Fred King
(11.5 ppg) and Chad Keller (1 1.6,
6.0 rbg). ‘

Pitt then plays cross-town rival
Duquesne at the A.J. Palumbo
Center on December 19.

Then it's on to a Dec. 22
matchup at the University of
Florida (3-3).

The Gators feature forward
Livingston Chatman (12.6 ppg,
6.4 rpg) and recently reinstated
7-2 center Dwayne Schintzius
(14.5, 6.5)‘.

Schintzius, a junior who was
invited to the Olympic Trials, has
been known as a troublemaker
for Gators coach Norm Sloan,
and produced only two points
and three rebounds in Pitt's 80-68
nationally televised victory over
Florida at the Field House Jan. 2.

Matthews is impressed by the
guard play of Florida despite the
loss of three-point threat Pat
Lawrence, Ronnie Montgomery
and NBA draft choice Vernon
Maxwell.

’’Florida has had a lot of
problems the last few years,” said
Matthews, referring to drug inves-
tigations and intra-squad argu-
ments, ”but I think Clifford Lett
is a good guard, a good athlete.”

‘Lett, a 6-3 senior, starts at off-
guard for the Gators.

Considered a top-20 team, the
Gators lost to Illinois 97-67 Tues-
day night, committing 26 turn-
overs. Lett paced Florida with 20
points.

The competition doesn't get
any easier for the Panthers follow-

I-. .5 :9‘ tr’ .* War 1* :2!-.* .«.~ 2 :*.:-

ing Florida. Pitt ventures to Tuc-
son, Arizona for a first-round
game with Northwestern in the
Fiesta Bowl Tournament.

Host Arizona will play Loyola
of Chicago, featuring the nation's
leading rebounder from last year,
sophomore Kenny Miller (14.7,
I 3.6).

The Northwestern Wildcats
return four starters from a 7-21
team, including double—figure
scorers Brian Schwabe and Jeff
Grose.

Should the Panthers make it
past Northwestern, they will like-
Iy face Arizona and All-American
senior forward Sean Elliot, who
averaged 19.6 points and 5.8 re-
bounds per game last season.

Forward Anthony Cook (13.9,
7.1) also returns for the Wildcats.

The Panthers still won't have

time to rest following the Dec.

28-30 Fiesta Bowl Tourney, as
they journey to Syracuse to take
on the undefeated and Top Five-
ranked Orangemen in a game
televised nationally by ESPN (8
p.m.). I =

All-American guard Sherman
Douglas leads the preseason NIT
Champion Orange, while star for-
wards Derrick Coleman and Bil-
ly Owens and guard Stephen
Thompson provide Syracuse with
a high-powered offense.

Pitt's first home game of the Big
East season is Jan. 7 against the
Boston College Eagles and All-

Conference guard Dana Barros.

PANTHER NOTES: Evans report-
ed that sophomore forward Brian
Shorter played against Jackson-
ville with afever in excess of 101
degrees, which could have con-
tributed to his uncharacteristic
seven-point, eight-rebound game.
Shorter had been averaging 16.7
points and 15.0 rebounds.

0 Forward Gilbert Johnson,
who scored two points and had
one rebound in a reserve role
against the Dolphins, definitely
requires surgery to remove a
bone spur in his knee following
this season.

”It may end his career," Evans
said.
