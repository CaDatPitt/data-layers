Computer

Center Arrest
Made

By SUE McFARLAN D
Pitt News Staff Writer _
The former assistant director of

Pitt's Computer Center was arraig-
ned yesterday on charges of
embezzling approximately $47,114
from Pitt’s 0’Hara Township
Computer site.

Sharon L. Dolmajer, 33, of"

Natrona Heights was arraigned
Monday on charges of theft,
receiving stolen property, and
misapplication of entrusted prop-
erty.

According to Assistant District
Attorney Walter Bunt, the univer-
sity sells computer time to outside
organizations. Payments for this
computer usage were diverted to a
Pitt cafeteria petty cash fund and
then to Dolmajer’s personal check-
ing account. 0

The initial investigation‘ of the
computer center by the district
attorney’s office was triggered by a
tip from an anonymous informant.

private auditor, Maryanne Ballus,

Rape Suspect

Receives
Sentence

Frank L. Wilson, 21, a former
freshman at Pitt, was sentenced
Monday to a 5-to-10-year prison
term for a sexual assault inside a
restroom of the Cathedral.

Common Pleas Judge James
Clarke called -Wilson a “danger to
society” during the sentencing of
Wilson, which stems from his
conviction on the assault charges
last fall.

Wilson was convicted for in-
decent assault for an April 11
attack on a Bloomfield woman. The
same jury acquitted him of rape
charges that stemmed from an

. assault on a Brushton woman that
‘ occurred near the University April

7.
Dr. Thomas M. Eberle, a

psychologist, testified against the

need for a prison term. He said that
Wilson was “not
violence?’, and that the act was
“immature” rather than “the
typical behavior of a rapist.”
Clarke, referring to his notes of

I Begins Restructure Next Week-

capable of _

By MARGI STUMPF
Pitt News Staff Writer

Pitt Union Program Council, beset with procedural
problems since its formation last June, will begin
revamping under the supervision of the Office of Student
Activities next week with a review of applications for the
council’s six committee chairmen and committee member
positions.

Terry Milani, associate director of Student Affairs,
explained in an interview yesterday what changes will be
made in the program council.

“The program council is adopting a , new style of
organization and ‘management that will provide resources
needed by members to effectively fill their roles and to
effectively provide quality programs for students,” Milani
said.

Emphasized in the search for committee chairmen and
members, which. begins Friday at 5 p.m. when all
applications are due in the Student Activities Office, will be
correlating applicant’s interests with job expectations,
Milani said. '

Program council experiences since June have revealed
thaf most problems stem from vague definitions, and
misunderstanding of various council
explained. .

“The program council’s problems are broader than just
lack of (intra-council) communications. It’s a matter of
organization. Communication problems come from lack of
understanding the role, authority and responsibility of a
council position. (This) understanding is a prerequisite to
communication,” Milani said. ,

“Prior to individual interviews for committee chairmen

positions, he i

and membership positions the Student Activities Office‘
and representatives of the Student Government Board will
have pre-iiiterview orientation sessions where we will
explain the roles, duties, authorities, and responsibilities,

1 etc. of chairmen and members, and relate our expectations

of those who fill positions. Then it will be up to us to
provide the processes and professional assistance needed
to make those jobs achievable,” Milani said. ‘

Expectations for positions, however, would not be
tremendous, he stated.

“It is not our goal to ask more of a student than would be
beneficial to them. Their academic success comes first, but
we have to expect an agreed-upon level of performance,”
said Milani. ‘

If a student does not meet the requirements of a position

Damage in Pitt’s dormitories has _

neither decreased nor increased
according to Donovan Hughes,
director of housing.

“The dollar amount is up,” said
Hughes, “but that isn’t necessarily
due ‘to an increase in the

’ vandalism. Costs of repair are also

up." -
Hughes said that each term the
repair bill is typically between
$13,500 and $14,500, as was the
case last term.

The primary problem in the
“semi-private” areas, which in-
clude the stairwells, ‘lounges,
bathrooms and lobbies, is the

=Inside today ’s Pitt News

damage to the elevators, Hughes
said.

“People break the directional
lights, the ﬂuorescent lights in the
elevators and damage the doors
and cables,” he -said.

Hughes cited several examples
of repairs which were made to the

elevators, with dollar figures-

ranging to $62 to $555.

Another major problem, accord-
ing to Hughes, is smashed
bathroom stall doors. Replacement
cost for a single door is $100.

Hughes said that since the
installation of carpeting and new
color televisions in the Towers
lounges there have been few, if
any, problems.

“We have the televisions hooked
up to a master network, so if
anyone would try anything, we'd
know immediately,” Hughes said.
“I think that the students use the
lounges much more now than
before the improvements.”

Hughes said there are more
problems in the Towers, but that is
due mainly to the higher concentra-
tion of students living in the
Towers and because the Towers are
such “a high traffic area.”

“The Quad has its share of
problems, /too,” said Hughes,
“although we have almost no
problems in Holland Hall.”

Hughes said that an act that has

“become the thing to do” in the
Quad is to unroll the fire hoses and
stretch them down the stairwell.

“While there is no money
involved here, it still takes time and
effort on somebody’s part to correct
the situation,” he said. i ’

“A light here and a.- stall door
there may not seem like a lot, but
when the entire bill for just one
term runs over $13,000 , we’re
talking big money,” Hughes said.
Every dollar that we have to spend
on repairs eventually affects room
costs, whether it’s this term or next
term, and it all comes back to the
students.” ’

The Kennedys, or this countrys “Royal family"
are once again in the news. This time the public
is buzzing over two biographies of Jacqueline
Kennedy Onassis. Maybe instead of buying the
books it would be better to just keep reading
those little tidbits about Jackie in “People"

“Back to Earth,” Cat Stevens’ newest album

tment. -pages ’

The officiating was “Ridiculous,” according
to Pitt coach Tim Grgurich. ‘ The Panthers
outrebounded and outshot Iona but lost in over-
time 84,-79. Was Monday night's game a sign of
things to come? With Ed Sheuerman out for
most of the season and Sam Clancy, the only big
man for the Panthers, trying to hold the defense
together, it’s a strong possibility. Maria Sciullo
analyzes the situation.

or carries out a job without proper authorization——a
criticism leveled against the council during last fall
term—he will be asked “to cease participation,” according
to Milani.

Emphasized in the carrying out of duties will be the
conviction that each job is a “learning experience," Milani
said. Failure in any aspect of council actions is possible, he
continued, but preventive measures will be taken by
Student Activities advisors.

Currently,'the council is supervised by ﬁve members of
the Student Activities Office. One full-time advisor will be
selected at a later date, according to Milani.

The position of general council chairman will be left
vacant until a later date when all other positions are filled.

“The Student Government Board and our office have
agreed not to fill the chairman position at this time in that
we are recruiting and training a new membership over the
course of this term. Then out of a group of those who know
the council and its operations we will choose a chairman,”
Milani said.

Also included in the revamping of the program council
will be the combining of the music and special interest
committees to form one entertainment committee. '

. order not to have concerts absorb so much money. We

want more diversity in programming than
concerts,” Milani stated. -

New program council chairmen and members will
conduct a survey of the student body to determine what its
interests are and to attempt to satisfy those interests. The
council does not provide programming designed to meet
the interests of one particular group on campus at a time,
which is a misconception of the council’s purpose,
according to Milani.

simply

“The program council is a ‘melting pot’ of student

interests,f’ Milani said.

Committee membership will also be reorganized so that
each will have a minimum of five members, instead of a
minimum of 10 as was the guideline for the past seven
months.

“We did not want to be obliged to seek 10 people for the
sake of having at least 10 on a committee. We want enough
work for each person to do so that each can be trained
effectively and have a valuable learning experience. If we
open up committees to all those who want to participate we
find a lack of interest due to not having enough work to do,
and we are not able to sufficiently ‘train and supervise,”
Milani said. ’

By PATTY TASCARELLA
Pitt News Staff Writer

Last week the second Surgeon
General’s report on smoking was
released to the public possessing
data even more dramatic than the
ﬁrst. While the number of smokers
in this country has decreased as a
whole, the number of teenage
smokers has increased eight-fold.
There has been ‘a signiﬁcant rise in
cases of lung cancer in females-
ﬁve times higher than the 1968
ﬁgure.

Bob LaCivita, health educator at
Pitt’s Student Health Service, said
thatalthough no special studies on
the effects of smoking have been
done at Pitt, the data likely
matches that done at other
comparable universities.

“You have to understand that in
studies like this, the actual number

of smokers is higher,” LaCivita
said.

LaCivita said that while edu-
cating people to the dangers of
smoking is an important step, Pitt
does not offer a course or clinic in
that area.

LaCivita, who
teaching a course on “areas
relevant to college students” said
the course content was determined
by polling students on the
problems of college life. They
selected topic such as drugs and
alcohol, stress and sexuality, but
“smoking didn't appear in the top
ﬁve selections,” he said.

LaCivita said that despite statis-
tics, a possible reason for the lack
of alarm is because “smoking is
socially acceptable.”

“If I were running a group on the

is currently '

dangers of smoking, I'd say it
would be important for people to
know the facts,” LaCivita said.

He detailed the three steps to
quitting smoking: knowing the
facts, change in attitude, and
actually giving up cigarettes.

“You can have word knowledge,
but the real key is a change in
behavior,” LaCivita said. “The
smoker has to want to change.”

LaCivita said he was surprised
that the report did not have any
information on damages incurred
by nonsmokers who are exposed to
the cigarette smoke of others.

“They are the ones who are
extremely concerned,” LaCivita
said. “A lot of pressure is put on
smokers by people who don’t
smoke.”

LaCivita also pointed out another

group that suffers from the
smoking of others according to the
report--unborn children.

“Pregnant women who smoke

have a higher instance of pre- %

mature birth,” he said.

Computer Arrest Made

(Continued from page 1)
District Attorney Thomas Jargiello
led to the ﬁring of Dolmajer in early
September and her eventual arrest.

According to District Attorney
Robert Colville, there was no
apparent abuse discovered in the
operation or maintenance of the
university computer systems.

Bunt praised the university in
particular Vice-Chancellor of Public
Affairs Bernard Kobos for its
cooperation in the investigation of
the center.

Bunt said only one arrest was
made in the case and added that it

is very unlikely that any other

arrests will be made.

According to Bunt, general
ignorance concerning the organi-
zation and operation of computer
systems was the greatest stumb-
ling block in the investigation.

Dolmajer was arraigned yester-
day before a Harmar Township
District Justice and was released
on her own. recognizance. She
faces a preliminary hearing Feb. 1.

Under the Pennsylvania Criminal

_ Code, the theft of pomputer time

from the O’Hara site is considered
a third class felony. Dolmajer faces
up to nine years in jail and a
$15,000 ﬁne or both.

  1 ‘Downtown atCM U’ to Open Feb. 1

An exhibition of architectural and urban design projects
created by Carnegie-Mellon University architecture
students will be on display in the Entrance Gallery of the
Museum of Art, Carnegie Institute, starting Feb. 1.

Titled “Downtown at CMU,” the exhibition consists of
nine design problems and alternate solutions for each. The
projects include: the development of the plaza site for
Heinz Hall, the Golden Triangle Branch of Carnegie
Library, Pittsburgh Visitors Center, a museum celebrating

"Pittsburgh industry and a hotel for the new Pittsburgh

Convention Center. The models are complemented by
drawings, photographs and renderings.

Urban design projects in the show experiment with the
development of larger geographic areas. “First Side,” for
example, proposes housing and other uses for the area
between the Monongahela River and the Boulevard of the
Allies. The “Celebration of Pittsburgh Industry” project
presents new ideas for exhibits of the historical
development of Pittsburgh’s natural resources and the
evolution of the city’s major industries. Among the
alternatives to the traditional concept of a museum
represented by this project is a walking tour, similar to
'Boston’s “Freedom Trail,” with exhibits at sites
throughout the Golden Triangle.

Social Work Executive to Speak

Chauncey Alexander, executive director of the National
Association of Social Workers (NASW), will be on campus
next Tuesday. Alexander will meet informally with faculty
and students during the day and will give an address at 4
p.m. in 2217 in the Cathedral.

‘Alexander has been executive director of the NASW
since 1970 and holds a Master's degree in social work from
the University of Southern California. NASW has over
75,000 members around the world. Alexander is a member
of the Academy of Certiﬁed Social Workers.

Gaydos Calls for U .S.—Canada Trade

Democratic Rep. Joseph Gaydos of Allegheny County
said he intends to advocate steel trade with Canada when
the House arm of the Congressional Steel Caucus
reconvenes later this month.

. Gaydos, chairman of the Caucus’ Executive Committee, '
intends to ask for a study of steel traffic between this nation
and the north. Gaydos said he is becoming increasingly
concerned over a worsening steel situation in this country.

“It appears,” Gaydos said, “Canada may be playing the
game once practiced by Japan, barring American steel
from home markets while increasing their shipments

ere.” -

Student Ernployment Overseas

Finding jobs in Europe and as far away as New Zealand
may not be as hard as it sounds. For the past 10 years, a
“Work Abroad”. program sponsored by the Council on
International Educational Exchange has been sending
students to France, Ireland, Great Britain and New
Zealand for the direct experience of working in another.
country—at the same time helping to reduce the cost of the
trip. ' ‘

Participants must find their own jobs but will have the
help of cooperating student travel organizations in each
country. In France, they may work during the summer, in
Great Britain they may work at any time of the year for up
to six months. In Ireland they work any time of the year for
up to four months and in New Zealand they may work for
up to six months if they arrive between May 1 and Oct. 31.

The jobs are usually unskilled-—in factories, department
stores, and hotels—with low salaries. But, students
generally earn enough to pay for room and board while
they work.

To qualify for the council’s program, students must be
between the ages of 18 and 30 and must be able to prove
their student status. ‘ ‘

the victim’s testimony during the
trial, pointed out that the victim
had said she was choked so hard
she passed out several times
during the attack. He also noted
that the victim said her blouse and
bra had been torn off in a single
motion by Wilson.

Assistant District Attorney Jose
Hernandez-Cuebas also attacked
Eber1e’s description of the assault.
He noted that after Wilson forced
the victim to perform oral sex, the
defendant threatened he would
come after her if she reported the
incident to the police.

Eberle admitted his description
of the attack was based on details
supplied by Wilson.

Clarke said that a jail term did
not mean the defendant should not
receive further treatment and that
“anything less than incarceration
would demean the seriousness of
the offense.”

Vandalism within the residenceihalls is rampant
here, except in one dormitory,‘ Holland Hall-. We
want to know one thing: why aren't you women
doing your part in this popular campus sport?

Apparently, you must be culturally deprived. Give
it a try and you might be surprised at the sheer en-
joyment you can get from this frivolous bit of fun.
There is nothing quite as exhilarating as a juvenile
game of “empty the fire extinquisher.”

If that is not your cup of tea, ,you might attempt
the fine art of kicking down a bathroom stall door. It
takes a strong leg and good aim to hit a door and
knock it from its hinges. A more mild form of late
night entertainment ‘is strewing toilet paper through
the hall. With a little practice, you can soon learn to
unravel a roll with one quick snap of the wrist.

Those who want to do a little wholesome body
building might rip the emergency phones from the
elevators. Jumping to smash the fluorescent bulbs in
the elevator ceilings builds strong legs and quickens
reflexes needed to dodge the flying glass. Unwinding
the floor fire extinguisher is a merry little stunt for
the young on a late night drunken spree. If you use
your imagination, you might think of a few new
games of your own.

For the more refined, there is the fine art of graf-
ﬁtti. If you have a special enemy, write their phone
number on the bathroom wall. Cut on the sorority
that didn’t give you a bid. If you really have a flair
for the written word, you even might be able to think

of a few original lines.

The adventurous souls ‘could venture beyond the
dorm into the inky campus night. Some spray paint
can add a little beauty to any building's walls. If you
wish to add a little Christmas spirit to your dingy lit-
tle room, a tree from the Chemistry Building lawn
can create a new decor. Budding woodcarvers might

whitt_le a while on the chairs and tables of the

Cathedral. A few extra slashes can add a modern

look to priceless objects built with loving care by true
craftsmen.

With a little thought, the possibilities are almost
endless.

What is the matter with the residents of Holland
Hall? Where’s that old college try? With a little time
and effort you might be able to increase the funds
spent for repair of damage from vandalism a few
thousand dollars. You would be part of a real cam-

‘ pus tradition.

After a n_ight of good-natured fun, you can fall
asleep knowing you’ve added extradollars to your
housing bill for the next year. You have nothing bet-
ter to do with your money than help pay a $13,000

repair bill, do you? If you are not convinced to try

the cheap thrills of destruction, at least do not squeal
on your more funloving brethren. After all, itvis all.
in fun and it's only your moneybthat has to pay for

America has Kennedy-itis and I,
for one, am sick of viewing this
country’s answer to the Royal
Family on every newscast, maga-
zine, newspaper and yes, even
column—not to mention at least
one seasonal special—be. it’ televi-
sion movie or athletic special.

Not just Senator’ Ted and his
ambiguous presidential aspiration,
or Bobby Jr., heir apparent, or
Joan and her battle against
alcoholism, or Maria Shriver’s
relationship with Arnold Schwar-
zennegger, or Caroline’s love life,
or Joe III’s engagement—the
Kennedy I'm sickest of reading
about is no longer a Kennedy.

J acquelineonassis is the subject
of two biographies this year and a
third is in the works.

“Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy
Onassis” by Stephen Birmingham
and “Jackie Oh” by Kitty Kelly are
both on‘ the best selling books

into: the life of someone who is
undeservedly “the world’-s most
famous woman.”

Birmingham; he of the slobber-
ing biographies on America’s
wealthiest families and a childhood
dancing partner of (excuse my use
of the familiar nickname) Jackie,
gushes controlledly over herrise to
prominence, making that process
(chiefly accomplished by marrying
—-and subsequently outliving—
wealthy and inﬂuential men) seem
digniﬁed. Birmingham tells no
more than what we non-readers of
“The National Enquirer” know
already.

Kelly, though, deals oritreams of
heretofore unknown gossip that is
tastlessly presented; like innuen-
dos about Jackie’s premarital
aﬁairs (usually quoting unidenti-
ﬁed sources) and ’dragging the
ghosts out of the family‘ closets and

' more raps on JFK than even J udith~

opera details that fill the tabloids at

M IR know that by reading Kelly’s

bookrl am no better than the usual
run-of-the-mill fan magazine read-
er. I kﬁow that -.my favorite
anecdote from the book-——a fellow
senator discussing JFK’s affairs
quipping “Jack was just like a roto
rooter”--is ‘certainly’ crude and
distasteful to most civilized and
sophisticated‘ folks. And so I will

the Towers to get in before 8 p.m.,
when security would be in effect.
Since Ihad no key to get out, I used
the red emergency phone and
called the campus police to send a
policeman to get me out.

Iwaited impatiently ten minutes
for him to come and called again.
The ofﬁcer said the policeman was
walking his heat, so it would be a
while: When he ﬁnally came I
asked the man if he was sipping
coffee at the White Towers.

He asked, “Do you have a sticker
to park in the garage,” and I said,

“No, I’m sorry I don’t. That’s why
I called the police to get me out.”
His response was, ,“Well, then I
suggest you say no more and just
get.out of here.”
Though it was not an emergency,

ten minutes is a long time for

something to happen to any girl.

Would the police have made it in

time if Monica Jones had been able

to reach the police phone? What

good is the phone if they won’t'
respond to a call? '

Cites “Mis-informati0n”

I would like to correct an error
printed in The Pitt News, (Consti-
tution Revision Up For Vote;
January 22, 1979). It was reported
that a proposed Constitutional
Amendment would extend the

franchisement to part-time CAS ’

and SGS students, because they
are presently “not permitted to
vote in either the Student Govern-
ment Board (SGB) or General
Studies Student Cabinet (GSSC)
elections."

The ‘truth is that part-time

SGS students have——and have
always‘ had—the right to vote in
GSSC elections. As a matter of
fact, many of these part-timers

serve as elected‘ representatives of "

the SGS Student Body.

  THE REFERENDUM 
  JANUARY22-25  

 

By FORREST BUFFENMYER

Pitt News Staff Writer

Backless
Eric Clapton
RSO -

It _doesn’t seem to matter how

    

long rock artists or groups have
been around, but rather how many
songs they can put on the AM hit
charts. ‘

The paradox here is that
generally, by putting hits on the
charts, the artists or groups will
increase their following a thou-
sandfold, but will lose some of their
die-hard, early fans for this same
reason. These fans will cry out and
protest that these artists have

“sold out,” become too commer-

cial.

Still: it works, Peter Frampton
was around for years before
becoming famous with “Frampton
Comes Alive” and the hit singles
“Show Me the Way” and “Do You
Feel Like We Do.” So was

Fleetwood Mac, whose “Rum-
ours” sold more copies than any
other album two years ago (until it
was dethroned by “Saturday Night
Fever.”)

Which brings us to Eric Clapton,
who has been around for most of
two decades. But his fame doesn’t
testify to this. Older fans will
remember the Yardbirds from the
1960’s and Derek and the Domi-
noes from the early ’70s as groups
ﬂourished briefly.

Clapton then released __ several
solo efforts. He was also rumored
to be battling a somewhat severe
drug problem.

\ Then, sudden surprising news!
Clapton released a new album
titled “461 Ocean Boulevard,”

which spawned a big hit single, “I
Shot the Sheriff.”

Then he faded out again
commercially, not to resurface until
“Slowhand.”

“Slowhand” was a large com-
mercial success. Released early
last year, it featured several hit
singles (“Lay Down Sally,” “Won-
derful Tonight,” “Next Time You
See Her”) as well as the FM hits
“Cocaine” and “The Core.”

It was here that many old
Clapton fans cried “Foul!” Had
Clapton sold out? In the meantime,
several hundred thousand new
Clapton fans were born.

Now it is they who must be
disappointed. “Backless,” the
newest Clapton effort, is a return to

  -Backless’ Aims for Early ClaptonFans

the period before “Slowhand,”_and
shows a strong blues inﬂuence.‘ In _
general, this blues influence
permeates “Backless” to a much
greater degree than. “Slowhand.”
Five of the 10 songs on the album
are blues.

The-album has a distinct Dylan
esque ﬂavor to it, around the
“Memphis Blues” period. There

are practically no love ballads in

the style of “Wonderful Tonight”
or even “May You Never,” with
the exception of two possible
singles, “Promises” and “Tell Me

tunes that are classic blues: “Walk

Out in the Rain” (written by Dylan)

and “I’ll Make Love to You

Fun in the Sun is a Theme»Overdone

By SAM ROSSI

The Californian car-culture, fun-
in-the-sun theme has been exploit-
ed for over a decade now by some
of rock music’s premiere perform-
ers. So why not take advantage of a
good thing?) That’s exactly what

Jack ‘Tempchin does on his ‘debut _-

album, titled “Jack Tempchin”.

‘.2?-

Tempchin is no newcomer to
rock. He has written a couple of
the Eagles’ biggest hits-

The album opens with “Stinga-
ree." a bouncy, up-tempo number

that one’s sure to mistake for an
Eagles’ tune.

Next, Tempchin does a fine
rendition of “Peaceful Easy Feel-

ing” with help from Browne and

Jennifer Warnes.

“She Belongedto You” is a mild
rocker concerned about the
modern, liberated woman.

“Fifteen Days Under the Hood”
follows. It’s a down home rock

tune that’s a good indication of
Tempchins’ diversity. '

“Lifetime Friend,” another fine

composition brings side one to a
pleasant close.

Side two begins with a soft,
easy-listening piece called “Golden
Life.” It’s one of the album’s
ﬁnest compositions with great sax

accompaniment by Harvey Thomp-
son. '

‘Air Time’ a Telling Look Behind CBS Eye

By GARY BRADFORD

Pitt News Staff Writer

Air Time
Gary Paul Gates
Harper & Row

If anyone considered the film
“Network” to be an exaggeration
of the TV’news business, then Gary
Paul Gates’ “Air Time” will show
them how fine the line between fact
and fantasy really is.

Gates, a former CBS newswriter,
recounts the rise to prominence of
his one-time employer through the
personal and working lives of its
correspondents, executives and
writers. Having been an insider,
Gastes is able to tell an engrossing
story through use of personal
conversations and anecdotes.

The CBS correspondents he
describes are asinteresting, if not
more so, than many of the events
they reported. Harry Reasoner,

Roger Mudd, Eric Sevareid are
all-knowing and unﬂappable in the
face of assassinations, wars and
disasters. Gates reveals them to be
as egotistical and jealousy-prone as
the rest of humanity.

On Harry Reasoner: “...includ-
ed in the coterie of CBS people who
regarded Reasoner as the best
anchorman in the business was
Reasoner himself.”

On Roger Mudd: “He had a
clear appreciation of himself as

being well-educated and a credit to
his profession, and he was often
scornful of colleagues who, in his
judgment, fell far short of his
intelligence...”

On Eric Sevareid: “....people fell
into the habit of referring to him,
not at all unﬂatteringly as ‘the Gray
Eminence’ and ‘the Pontiff.”’

That is not to say the book is a
hatchet job; all the above-men-
tioned and others are seen in the
act of reporting and analyzing the
news. In fact, this book is a good
“how-to” manual for aspiring
broadcasters. especially in its

dealing with Walter Cronkite’s

“Air Time” is comparable to

Rose Royce made its ﬁrst

night at the Stanley Theater and
because of the good response, a

either show.

Mother’s Finest featured ﬁne lead

Rose Royce.

With its three piece horn section,
Rose Royce brought on something
that had been missing in the show
until then. However, the group was
deﬁcient in the one area where
Mother’s Finest had sounded so
good. Rose Royce’s lead guitar
player had been forced to return
home because of illness and the
nine member band was reduced to

After an hour and a half of
playing, Rose Royce left the stage.
They didn’t come back. The

everything the crowd wanted to

Clapton’s backup band contains
very capable musicians. March
Levy, Clapton’s backup vocalist,
shines on “Roll It” and is very
good on “Promises.” Clapton’s
guitar work is excellent through-
out. But even the most capable
musicians could not have helped
this album, for it is probably
Clapton’s selection of material that
brings “Backless” up short.

Swimmers   to Test Terrapins,   Difficult Maryland Pool

ByKARENKADlI.AK

Pitt’s swim team (4-0) will have
its hands full when it meets
Maryland Saturday.

The Terrapins are one of the top
teams in the East and are probably

one of the few teams that can '

defeat Pitt.

Maryland naturally worries
Panther freshman Sandy Pidgeon,
but probably not as much as its
pool. Unlike most, the pool at
College ‘Park has ﬂat walls and
cloudy water which makes for a
difﬁcult racing situation.

“We’ll have to exercise precision

if we want to win,” Pidgeon said.
“We can prepare for them as a
team, but we can’t really prepare
for their pool. We have to take it as
it comes.”

Pidgeon admittedly has other
things to worry about, including a
confrontation with former Pennsyl-
vania high school state champion
Billy Battle in the 200-yard
individual medley.

“I’m looking forward to this
meet very much,” Pidgeon said.

‘ ‘Maryland’s a top contender in the
East. I think we can beat them. I
don’t know how badly we can beat

them because their pool makes

such a big difference, but we still

should win.’ ’

One of Pitt’s top recruits,
Pidgeon has ﬁnished ﬁrst several
times this season, including a
victory against Penn State last
Saturday in the 400-yard individual
medley.

The freshman from Saltsburg,
Pa. is accustomed to winning.
Competing for Kiski Prep, which
has one of the top prep school
teams in the nation, Pidgeon last
year was among the national
leaders in the 200-yard breastroke.

“Kiski has a quality program,”
Pidgeon said. “In that respect, I’m
probably more advanced than most
freshmen. I’m satisﬁed with what
I’ve done this season.”

Pidgeon also was recruited by
Penn State, West Virginia and
several small colleges, but chose
Pitt because of its growing swim
program and its proximity to his
home. ‘

Pidgeon, along with Rick Carter,
Greg Pelton, Don Keer, and Bill
Pierce, all of whom have seen
action this season, are part of a
great freshman class.

‘ ‘I don’t know if you can compare
this year’s freshman class with last
year’s,” Pidgeon said. “Last
year’s was probably the best Pitt
ever had.

“I still don’t know if you can
compare them,” Pidgeon contin-
ued. “Pitt recruited a lot of
freestylers last year. Most of the
freshmen this season are strok-

I)

ers.

Like the rest of his teammates?
Pidgeon looks forward to qualifying
for the National Collegiate Athletic
Association Championship to be
held in March. A

  Panthers Lose In
Overtime, 84-79

UNIONDALE, N.Y.—Pitt’s Pan-
thers, a basketball team about
which much can be lamented but
little can be explained, led a good
Iona College basketball squad by
six points when just 35 seconds
remained in a game at Nassau
Coliseum Monday night.

Anyone familiar with this team’s
recent malady knows what tran-
spired during regulation play’s
ﬁnal 35‘secon'ds and a pointless
overtime period: Iona converted
Pitt-produced opportunities into a
last-minute win.

Forced to play ﬁve guards and
faced with officiating he called
“ridiculous,” Pitt coach Tim
Grgurich saw his team outrebound
Iona, outshoot Iona and lose to
Iona, 84-79. ' 1

basketball, campaign, coach Tim
Grgurich predicted the team would be as
successful as its big men. Well, since Pitt
had. only two returning regulars that fit
the description (6-6 Sam Clancy and 6-
11 Ed Scheuermann), that the team
wasn’t exactly deep at the center
position is undeniable.

Before the start of the season,
Grgurich lost one half of the aforemen-

’ tioned pair of big ‘men when Scheuer-

, mann underwent surgery to remove a
bone‘ growth from his left ankle. Doc-
Etors warned that the junior from Bald-
{win might not be able to play until

would have played thatigame. I try not

>Jeff Gordon, freshman wrestler
from Avella, Pa. who was Class AA
state champion at 132 pounds last year,
had compiled a 5-5‘ Collegiate record
before sustaining a recent injury. Gor-
don was not hurt in an intercollegiate
match; instead, the unfortunate incident
occurred during a practice in which he
and assistant coach Rande Stottlemeyer
were executing takedowns. The fresh-

man emerged from the drill with a

pinched nerve in his back.

Another ‘what if-’ wasA§an%swered* iby- 

Pitt’s uncanny ability to perform
well enough to make a game
exciting and poorly enough to make
defeat possible was not absent here
Monday evening. Panthers missed
foul shots, fumbled rebounds,
fouled when they had been warned
against it and fouled out when they
were needed most.

But Pitt- received assistance
during this dash toward defeat.
Iona (13-4) would have been a ﬁne
conquest for Grgurich’s 7-8 Pan-
thers, though 6 foot, 10 inch center
Jeff Ruland played poorly for the
Gaels, and Pitt might have avoided
defeat were it not for destiny and
awful ofﬁciating. -

Iona was allowed 12 seconds-t

“advance the ball past the 'halfcourt*

line while'Pitt was attempting ‘to

A eliminate the Gaels’ two‘-point lead‘
in the overtime’s ﬁnal minute. Gael I,

coach Jim Valvano joked about the
call after the game; Grgurich
stalked the referrees after. the
game and shouted, to noone in
particular, “Cheaters. ‘

‘ ‘Unbelievable, ’ ’ Grgurich I said.
“They (the referees) were I a
disgrace to the game.”

The game’s end ruined a good
performance by Pitt, which out-
rebounded Iona, 57-30, though the
Panthers employed a ﬁve-guard
lineup at times. Sam~Clancy had 17
rebounds for Pitt; Sammie Ellis_had

Wilson, who qualified for the
NCAA cross-country champion-

. ships last November, had defeated
Siriano in that sport where the race
is six miles long. .- The Mountaineer
had also placed second in the 1500
meters at the 1978 Pitt Outdoor
Invitational, showing his talent at

.. both the long and short distances.

Siriano let his main opponent
take the lead through a 2:06 half
mile, then with a lap and a half to
go, passed Wilson and won the
race by three seconds.

“I thought it would come down

to the wire,” said Siriano. “But I

had a lot left at the end, enough to
run a 60-second fourth quarter.”

His winning time of 4:12.1 was
roughly six seconds off the
qualifying standard for NCAA
championships in the mile. Siriano
later defeated Wilson in the
two-mile run , this time by 75 yards.

Freshman Larry Kinney’s victory
in the triple jump took place in
Pitt’s dusty, storage-room-type
jumping area, butthe atmosphere
was not inhibiting as he leapt 48-9,
one of the Panthers’ best efforts in
recent years. It was also a personal
best for Kinney, a high school state
champion in the event from Garnet
Valley, Pa.

“Larry has tremendous natural
ability,” commented jumping
coach Dan Goodyear. “He’s still a
little bothered by a leg muscle he
tore last summer and it’s the only
thing keeping him from hitting over
50 feet.” p _

“My leg felt O.K. I felt real good
for the ﬁrst time out his year, ” said
Kinney.

Overall, the Panthers placed first
in all but three events.
Mountaineer standout Garnett
Edwards won the high hurdles,
50-yard dash and ‘long jump. Pitt
victories were claimed by: Larry

for The Pantherettes won 10 or 15

“We had to look tough against
Penn State,” said head coach Dick
Bradshaw. ‘ ‘And winning this meet
without three swimmers shows how
well-rounded we are.” /

\ Penn State coach Ellen Perry
said he believes Pitt is one of the

top ten teams in the country this
year. Two 1 Penn State swimmers
qualiﬁed for nationals and Perry
was pleased with her team’s overall
performance. .

“We are trying to qualify as
many swimmers as we can for
nationals before the Eastern
regional championships,” said
Perry. “We accomplished what we
came to do.”

Bradshaw was especially satis-
tied and considered Penn State one
of Pitt’s toughest opponents.

“We're probably the strongest
team in the East now,” said
Bradshaw. “We have 16‘ to 20
names in the top ten college

teams listed are Penn State and

Tressler, Evans and Martino Lead _Pitt

E By KAREN KADILAK
Pitt News Staffwriter

After losing to defending nation-
al champion Penn State last
weekend, Pitt’s women gymnasts
(2-1) defeated Maryland, 129.7-
1_l0.55, last night at Trees Hall.

The Pantherettes, paced by
sophomore Bonnie Tressler, swept
the night’s events. Tressler
finished first in all but one event
while winning the all-around
competition with a score of 33.95
points.

Two other Pantherettes—fresh-
men Holly Martino (33.05 points)
and Roxanne Evans (31.65)—trail-
ed Tressler in overall scoring.

Pantherette coach Donna De-

 

Marino Sanft said she was satisfied
with the win, but was concerned
about her team's performance on
the balance beam, which so far has
been the Pantherettes’ poorest
event.

“I really don’t know what the
problem is,” Sanft said. “We are
executing our movements well. I
think it just may be nervousness.

“It’s funny, but the balance
beam was our best event last
year,” Sanft continued. “It was a
breeze. It’s really hard to figure
out what the problem is.

“We did well on the vaulting and
floor exercises,” Sanft continued.
“It was a good meet for us. We

wanted to score 130 points, and we
just missed.

“We’vejust been inconsistent in
some areas because we are so
young, but that’s more of an
explanation than an excuse. As
young as we are, we still should be
more consistent than what we’ve
been.”

Injuries continue to plague the V

Pantherettes. Myra Bachuchin,
(the team’s top performer last
year), Evans and Alison Hoburg
are recovering from leg injuries.
However, all except Evans, out
with a sprained ankle, are expected
to compete when the Pantherettes,
ranked 15th nationally, meet
11th-ranked Michigan State Sun-
day afternoon at Trees Hall.
