Coach Ralph Mitterling has announced he will start Ben Kish, speed-
ball ace, against the Mountaineers in the hope of breaking the Panther

the Indiana Teachers and should
give the Pitt mound staff ‘a needed
lift with adequate pitching.

Kish’s assignment comes news that
gridder Edgar-Jones may be lost
to the pitching corps for the re-
mainder of the ‘season. Jones is
suffering from an injured elbow
which has failed to respond to treat-

Track Team Hopes to Extend Unbeaten
Duel Record Against Indiana Invaders

With the greatest galaxy of big names in track ever represented in a
Western Pennsylvania dual cinder test, the University of Pittsburgh plays
host to Indiana university tomorrow afternoon at Pitt Stadium.

Every event should produce a torrid struggle for points, but because
the Panthers have greater all around st  ngth, the News predicts ‘a 69-62

win for balance over the Hoosié’f’s in

Most illustrious of the Indiana
cindermen to appear tomorrow, Roy
Cochran should be in top form to-
morrow. International 400-meter
hurdle champ, Big Ten indoor quar-
ter mile titlist, and world indoor
record holder of the quarter mile at
48.2 second, the Hoosier captain
shows here in both the 440—yard
dash and 220-yard low hurdles.

Another all-star performer in the
Indiana cast, Campbell Kane, soph-
omore marvel, won the Big Ten in-
door mile toga this year in 4214.3,
anchored three winning relay four-
somes in the Drake relays last
week, and ﬁnished second in the
national senior AAU halfmile last
summer.

Then there is Archie Harris,
husky negro weight star, who cop-
ped the Big Ten indoor shot put
title and has thrown the discus 164-
feet 5 inches. In addition, the vis-
itors have Tolliver, distance ace,
who has run 4:17 and 4:19 for the
mile the last-two weekends, and

shows a marked increase over that
of last year, according of Edward

erably.'high number of seniors by
commencement,” declared. Mr. Wil-
liams. '

Last year’s placement totaled
about 28 per cent of the male grad.-
uates, while this year, to date,

lap, and after tomorrow night pro-
duction members will have left on-

ly their memories.

Some of the gold that comes to
tin pan alley writers found its way
last night into the pockets of the
writers of two “Snap Your Fingers”
melodies. Between acts of yesterday
cvening’s performance, Herman Is-
raeloﬁ’, D42, and Eugene Feldman,
D42, wereiawarded $10 for their

song “From the Rooftops.” Theiﬁrst
prize money is donated each year

by'R. Herbert Buchman, ’3l, for
the student-written
judged best by students in the pro-
duction.

The song selected as second in

song’ that is '

popularity was “My Heart’s In
Danger,” written by Thomas Ste-
phenson, BA41, who was awarded
$5. This prize is presented. annually
by Dr. Leo Shonfeld, ’l5.

First Editorial

. TITH THIS issue a junior staff moves into the

editorial and business ofﬁces of the Pitt News.
New supervisors now take over the alleged type-
writers, piles of copy paper and the invariably
empty paste pots which go with getting out a
newspaper three times a week. And new guardi-
ans have assumed traditions of a 65-year old pub-
lication.

A deﬁnite policy for the coming year is difficult.
to ‘set down at this time and in this space. It
niight, however, be described as a. strict interpre-
tation of our sub-title-—“Ofﬁcial Student News-
paper of the U11iversit_v of Pittsburgli.”

\Ve intend to center on the theme, “student.”
We hope to add spice to our news accounts, col-
umns and editorials, and so make the News more
appetizing for student readers. That this sounds
better as h.yp0thetical policy than demonstrated in
accoinplished fact, we fully realize.

The Mexican Locale
_Returns With. a Bang

By Robert Hamilton

 

At the sound of the shot we pulled our car off the
road and jumped out. We ran up an arroyo, and
halted, still within sight of the road. I squatted down
in 3 Chimp of cactus, pulling off my white sombrero,
and sliding a black ncckerchief up over my face except
101‘ my eyes. Pablo squatted in the shadow of a
m€‘Squite clump, and pulled his black hat low.

Across the river the mountains of Mexico rose
black and stark against the blue-black sky. I won-
dered who had tipped off the Patrol. Around the curve
in the road a revolver cracked twice, to be followed by
a full minute of booming shotguns and the ringing bang
of high powered riﬂes. We could see the reﬂection of
the muzzle blasts against the rocks above us.

A car pulled around the curve, a searchlight mount-
ed on the hood. When the light fell on our car it
stopped, and men leaped out and clustered around the
auto.
never help free Mexico,” I whispered.

The light on the patrol car began to cut across the
hillside in large circles, slowly growing smaller. As
its rays approached me I crouched, fired twice at it
and leaped a good six feet away and fell ﬂat. The
cactus patch I had just left became "a sodden mass of
pulp as the men below cut loose with all their arma-
ment at the ﬂash from my revolver. On the other side
of the patch Pablo also ﬁred at the light, and leaped.

Suddenly the light found Pablo. He stood up,
pulled the trigger of his revolver, and as it clicked
futilely hurled it at the group below and threw up his
hands. I had little ammunition left, and a few mo-
ments later we were both seated in the back seat of
the car headed for the El Paso jail.

“A visitor to see you,” said the guard, and ushered
in a girl. “Reporter,” added the guard, and lit a
cigarette.

We chatted with the sob sister for a while, and then
she began to ask questions. “Tell me,” she said, “Have”
you ever had any-er-accidents, in your-ah-careers?”

“She means we ever shot anybody boss,” whispered
Pablo, and grinned to himself. “No miss,” he said to
her, “I got bit by a rattlesnake once, but that was no
accident. He did it on purpose.” ‘

The girl made strangled noises, then. smoothed.

down her dress and addressed ‘me,’ ‘‘How’d__ you ever
happen to become an outlaw? You don’t look like -one
of Saturnino’s men.” _ . ,  , . . i

“I am not one of Saturnino’s men,”—_I, replied, “I am

-Border Patrolmen was -being besieged by some smug-

‘ glers and bandidos a short distance from .my home.

Greatly outnumbered, the little group was hanging on
'_grin”=.ly, praying for reinforcements. Inspired by their

‘ brave stand, I oiled up my guns and rode forth to

join them. As I topped a little hill above the ﬁeld of
battle I stopped for a moment to make a plan, oh woe,
and that was my undoing. I looked down on them,
ﬁrst to the seven patrolmen on my left, next at the
forty outlaws on my right, then I rode down and joined
the bandits.”

I have undertalvsen this excursion
into ‘new and greener fields of jour-
nalism with a resolve never to ven-
ture into the higher ﬂights of poli-
tics or economics. I shall no doubt
be a columnist apart. The columnar

solitude to which I have retreated
will not result, therefore, in con-
troversies with my colleagues.

This column shall be dedicated to
the betterment of the students. The
betterment program begins with in
essay on decibelling.

2: =1: 4:

Decibelling ———derived from deci-
bel, which is a measurement for
sound—-is a student affliction which
returns with spring and open win-
dows. A form of verbal doodling,
decibelling, or the misjudging of
class-room whispers, is brought
about by the noises which ﬂow
through from the outsides via the
open windows. These external
noises are fairly constant and usu-
ally can be counted upon to protect
the whisperer. Sometimes, however,
the outdoors fails to produce, and
thus a whisper, sent forth with
conﬁdence of protection, is project-
ed into a very audible aside.

Whispering

I knew spring was here when I
decibelled in Dr. William’s Inter-
national Law class. Midst a pass-

age of 18th century Enlightenment

and a 76 Hamilton, I turned to my
right hand man and Whispered,
“Where the hell are we?” I remem-
ber the exact words, because the
street car had gone and my was—to-
bc whisper thundered over a start-
led class. Right-hand man Dick
Harmon must have been shocked
because his “I don’t know either,”
was in the same volume. It too went
forth among the words of Voltaire
and Montesquieu.

Dr. Williams took it very well,
though.

Decibelling isn’t much of a dan-
ger in the winter. Then the win-
dows are shut and a confirmed
class—‘:oom whisper is not forced

by open windows is one of the most
reliable harbingers of spring.

It hasn’t always been like this
though. When I was a freshman,
decibelling was an all-year around
hazard. That was when construc-
tion work was being carried on in
the Cathedral innards, and a lecture
was often accompanied by buzz-
saws, electric drills, and pneumatic
riveters. Many a Whisper began in
the racket of a riveting gun. and
ended up in an audible solo and
embarrassment.

I don’t know what can be done
about decibelling. As long as we
have open windows and street cars,
accidents will happen. Since there
is no truth to the rumor that the
PAA is demanding the removal of
the Fifth Avenue street cars, I
guess I’ll have to keep on decibel-
ling or stop whispering.

It’s quite a problem.

Leighton. Hears
Uf Finn Valor

The courage and the resistance of
a people now defeated is vividly
brought forth in a letter sent live
weeks ago by one geologist to an-
other geologist here at the Univer-
sity about the conditions of Finland
during the war.

The miseries of the gallant Finns
are described in the letter sent by
the Director of the Geological Sur-
vey of Finland to Henry Leighton,
head of the department of geology,
who received it here this week.

“For close upon three months,”
the letter said, “we have repulsed
alone the incessant attacks of the
cnemy’s million-headed army
against our 1,500 kilometres-long
land frontier. Several hundred ene-
my aeroplanes have. also daily pour-
ed explosives and incendiary bombs
on the towns and centers of popu-
lntion behind the Front;

“But although the hundreds of
civilians, chieﬂy women and chil-
dren, have been killed in this way,
and many buildings have been de-
stroyed, our nerves are as firm as
granite rock, on the surface of
which the Finnish people live and
work.

“We are accustomed to battling
with an Arctic, barren nature, and
we are resolved to endure, although
we have had to submit, in the face
of tremendous odds, to an onerous
peace.” .

On the first day of the war, the
letter continues, the geological par-
ty was bombed an.d later one of its
staff, Dr. Mikkola, was killed in ac-
tion.

Miller Reveals it
Signs. of Strain

’ I{=ditor,T_he Pitt News}

I have been greatly angered by
the review ofthis year-’s Pitt Cap
and Gown show which was written
by your self-styled critic Frank
Miller, and whch appeared in your
Wednesday issue. _
. Miller has gone too. far. He said 
that I should be cremated.-

can arrange it, I should be glad to
punch Miller’s nose publicly.
Student productions should be
dealt with sympathetically. ‘Mr.
Mill-er" evidently was trying tobe
cute; one.Geo.rge Jean Nathan is
enough. ~ . . i I j

I think that, all in;_all, this year’s
show is good. It .wa.s.written for
students, and geared to their laugh
pace. The cast and chorus are su-
pcrb, as are the dances, costumes,
and music; and the script at least
organizes these elements into a
pleasing whole.

Tonight’s show-—the student show
—-«should be the test of the show
and also of my script. Hereafter,
let the students criticize. and let
l'~/Iiller go back to writing themes
on Thoreau. What does he know
about art‘?

Student Opinion Su1°iwejy*s Prove
Popularity of Bands on Radio

By Student Opinion Surveys
of America

Classical musical radio programs
rank far below dance orchestras and
comedians in popularity among col-
lege students, 21 nation-wide poll
conducted by the Student Opinion
Surveys reveals.

'1 abulations of the results to the
cuestion “Which is your favorite
radio program,” show no symphonic
programs placed among the ﬁrst ten
radio programs named by university
students as their favorites. Accord-
ing to the poll, the Philharmonic,
Metropolitan Opera, and NBC Sym-
phony programs ranked eleventh,
fourteenth, and sixteenth, respec-
tively, in popularity.

Jack Benny with a rating of ten
per cent topped the list, with Bob
hope, another comedian, placing
second. Most popular dance or-
chestra among the students at the
present is Glenn Miller, although
Benny Goodman is trailing close
behind.

Tennis Squad
Picked to W7 in

Over Rockets

Panther Netters Hope
For Initial Success
Of Current Campaign

Disappointed by Jupe Pluvius
last Wednesday in their quest for
their initial victory of 1940, Pitt’s
racquetmen square off against Slip-
pery Rock on the Trees Gym courts
tomorrow afternoon with bright
hopes for a decisive victory.

After three successive shutout
defeats by Ohio State, Penn State,
and Miami, the Panther batsmen
were forced to save their best shots
for the Rockets when rain-soaked
courts wiped the match with In-
diana State Teachers off the card.

Slippery Rock’s tennis hopefuls
haven’t been world-beaters during
this campaign, and Pitt should
have little difﬁculty in downing
them.

Present plans call for coach Dave
O’Loughlin to use captain Joe Kris-
tufek at number one, and Frances
Harmuth, Ed Goehring, and Dud-
ley Weiss at number two, three and
four shots, respectively.

Frank Gaenger and Bob Martin
banged the ball at number ﬁve and
six the last time out, and will
probably be there tomorrow. Bob
Nickeson, Chuck Hergenroeder, and
Syl Kortz may break into the line-
up in the doubles play.

Last Tuesday Miami’s powerful
aggregation trounced Pitt, 9-0,
without the loss of a set. Coached
by former intercollegiate champ
Gardner Mulloy, the Orangemen

blasted their way past the Panthers

without any trouble.

Billy Gillespie, former national
junior champion, won over Kristu-
fek, 6-2, 6-4. Hardie tripped Har-
muth 6-1, 6-0; Duff defeated Goeb-

Outing Club Takes
Laurel Ridge Trip

Rounding out the schedule 
ned for the WAA_Outing Club .-this,

year a trip isplanned for this week-
end, May 3, 4, and 5, at the gov-
ernment recreation center of Lau-
rel , 'R_idge..,.;. .

up

An expected group of 30 mem- .

bers will be the largest number of
participants in the history of the
Outing Club.

Good weather will allow most of ‘
the week-end to be devoted to hik- T

ing over the mountains surround-
ing the camp. Sunday services will
be conducted by chaplain, Gail
Brendlinger, BA4l.

ﬁrid Regulars
Go After First
Vvin over Suits

Revenge will be the keynote of
the varsity footballers attack as
they make their third weekly bid
for a victory over the “not-so-low-
13"’ second stringers of coach Char-

ley Bowser’s spring football squad.
The subs already hold decisions
over their big brothers in two pre-
vious starts, showing scores of 9-6
and 7-6.

Ernie Bonelli, the second string
right halfback, turned in the best
performances of both games. His
ﬁne defensive play and consistent
Off-tackle gains provided Coach
Bowser with a little gleam of hope
in an otherwise disappointing aft-
ernoon.

The regulars will probably be
without the services of Edgar Jones
in tomorrow’s skirmish because of
injuries and baseball activities.

Mike Sekela, Frank Saksa, Bob
Thurbon, and George Kracum, will
be on backﬁeld duty for the varsity
squad while the second stringers’
hind-patrol will show the names of
Walt West, Jack Stetler, Ernie Bon-
elli, and John Ross.

The game is scheduled for 3
o’clock tomorrow at the Tree's
training ﬁeld.

Golfers Leave
On Important
Eastern Trip

Coach Art Underwood, his six
best golfers--‘andj his manager, left
yesterday for Ithaca, N. Y., to par-
ticipate in the ﬁrst two matches of
their Eastern Intercollegiate Golf
Association play.

This afternoon the linksmen have
an; engagement ~§with'~ the ‘ Cornell
 and tomorrow ,;_morning they
‘meet the Penn State aggregation

for the-second time this season.

Igive of  [six j. men who have

"played in matches this season are

, _ _, _ _ ,  ., inaking the trip and one new man,
beat Kristufek and Weiss, 61-2,"6=‘~.<.1.;-"‘-« '

so'ph'oniore' Jim Rees, will replace
veteran ‘ Hprner ,,,,_l\{IeCl_intock.
"‘"Th‘e “sé<>é‘n men “who will make
the trip are Jim Kennedy, Bill Kra-
mer, Bob Seybold, Bill Riley, Lar-
ry Geyer, Rees, and manager Jim
Mclntosh.

Coach Underwood has not set any , ‘P

position of play as yet and will

~ »‘; probably have different lineups for g
each match, in order to get better ‘

balance.

Kramer and Kennedy are sure to
team up in twosome play, but their
position is indeﬁnite. . .

Underwood is anticipating mor
trouble from Penn State and is
prepared for it. In their ﬁrst meet
with Pitt this year the Lions played

their number one and two men in,
lower slots, thus cleaning up on the-

weaker end of the Panther team.
Kramer and Kennedy may even

play as low as ﬁve and six if State

does the same thing tomorrow.

bright has split. His win came
over the Ohio Wesleyan nine and

Pi Lams Battle Undefeated Phi Gams
In Top Intramural Mushball Contest

Feature attraction on today’s six
game intramural mushball card will
be the tussle between the Pi Lams

and the undefeated favorites from’

the Phi Gam house.
Jaife to Hurl

Rain caused postponement Wed-
nesday of the long awaited battle
between the undefeated nines of
Sigma Alpha Mu and Phi Gamma
Delta, leaders in the fraternity
mushball league.

Bert Jaffe, Pi Lam hurler, will
oppose either Quick or Colvin, Phi
Gam aces on the hill. Mattes,

Krasnow, Sable and Kreimer will.

lead the assult on the famed Phi
Gain “home run row.”

Sigma Chi, present occupants of
second place will battle the unpre-
dictable Kappa Sigma team on

Field 2 today at 3 o’clock. Sigma
Chi was dropped from the ranks of
the undefeated by Phi Delta Theta
early this week.

Coates, Sigma Chi’s one and only
pitcher, will be on the hill against
the Kappa Sigs. Grimm, Kappa
Sigma cleanup hitter, should lead
the ﬁeld in base hits.

Phi Delts on Defensive

Phi Delta Theta, with one of last
years more powerful aggregations,
has been more or less on the defen-
sive side. Either Dickinson or Cox,
who handle the pitching duties for
the Phi Delts, will be on the mound
against the SAE’s today at 5 o’clock
on Field 1.

Sigma Alpha Epsilon also has

two outstanding pitchers, Stu, Loop .

streak today.

Both the Phi Gams and the
SAM’s had to step despite their
weak opposition Tuesday.

in the last inning to tie the Phi
Gams, then hold the favorites on
even terms for three overtime in-

, nings before losing, 10-9. Joe Con-

nell pitched for the losers.

Sigma Chi Loses , '

Red Silverman took 'Mendlow”s

place for the day and pitched the

victory. He also bounced out three

hits.

Phi Delta Theta shutout the pre-
viously undefeated Sigma Chi team,

While everybody was moving on
May 1, co-chairmen of the Novelty
Day committee, Bill Sheris, BA41,
and Bob Shaw, Ed4l, thought that
students might kick up some old
shoes and clothes and so Tuesday
has been set as “old clothes day.”

Because a large number of stu-
dents will be participating in the
novelty day events, the old clothes
will ‘be more suitable -and “make
for a more impersonal enjoyment
of the scheduled events,” according
to the chairmen.

Anniversary

By Julia Waida

One of the oldest student or-
ganizations on campus, the Men's
Glee Club, will celebrate its ﬁftieth
anniversary with a home concert in
Foster Memorial on Wednesday
evening at 8:30 o’clock.

Back in 1890, John L. High, an
alumnus of the University, then
called the Western University of
Pennsylvania, organized 12 male
singers and the mandolin and banjo
clubs into the original glee club.

The membership in 1894 had in-

creased to 14 voices, but was dis-‘

banded in 1901 because of lack of
interest on the part of graduate
members. George T. Sulzer reor-
ganized the club in 1905. That year

the club presented a series of three
concerts in the tri-state area.

The club continued to expand
and in 1917 it obtained its ﬁrst
prominent director, Harvey Gaul.
Gaul, now an outstanding ﬁgure in
local music circles and at that time
music critic for one of the down-
town newspapers, held the director-
ship for several years.

Activity again lagged in the post-
war lull. However, interest was
revived in 1927 when the organiza-
tion was combined with the dental
chorus by Dr. W. H. Wright, pro-
fessor of prosthetic dentistry and
anatomy, who acted as director
until 1936. Theodore M. Finney,
associate professor of music appre-
ciation, succeeded him and is the
present director-

dergone considerable change in its
50 years. The Glee Club, which
was of early English origin, became
less popular and the German male
quartet took its place. However,
the original form was maintained
at the University and a varsity
quartet was added. By 1920 the
mandolin and banjo were losing
popularity and the University club
became a strictly vocal organiza-
tion.

This year’s membership of 50
voices is coincidental with the ﬁf-
tieth anniversary. The number de-
pends on interest and results of
competitive vocal tests. A maxi-
mum was reached with 80 members.
A key is granted after participation
of two years and the honor key is
awarded for ‘four years’ service.

In its ﬁftieth year the group has
gone far. In addition to ‘weekly re-
hearsals it appears at University
functions, at local broadcasts, and
for various civic and club groups.
A part of each season’s activity is
a concert tour which includes some

30 to 40 performances.

During the past season the organ-
ization sponsored jointly with the
Ur‘.-iversity Band, a musician’s ball,

took part in the ﬁrst student opera
presented at the University, and
assisted the University symphony
orchestra on its annual trip.
