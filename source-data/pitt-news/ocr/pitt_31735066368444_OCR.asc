Funding, 

Tuition
Increase

By BRIAN BALK

Governor Dick Thornburgh
recommended a 2 percent increase in
state appropriations for Pitt in his
1983-84 budget proposal presented
yesterday afternoon.

The increase of $79,741 is the low-
est increase since 1978. If the budget
is approved, Pitt will receive $1.5
million next year.

According to Chancellor Wesley
Posvar, “Higher education in the
commonwealth is facing a lean year,
based on Governor Thornburghisl
proposed FY84 budget. .While we
recognize the stark economic reali-
ties which Pennsylvania faces, a 2
percent increase in the appropria-
tions for the University of Pitts-
burgh falls short of our anticipated
cost for the coming year.”/

Of Thornburgh’s proposed
budget, 30 percent (or $136 million)
falls into education-related»
expenses. However, $117 million of
the total $136 allocated for educa-
tion would go directly to basic
education. -

The" remaining, $ 19 million would
be split among 14 state-owned, four
state-related universities and -14
community colleges.

Senate Examines Computer Question

By PEGGY FERRl

Long-range planning for compu-
ter terminals'at Pitt is at a crossroads
and its present status was the main
focus of a report before the Senate
Council meeting on Monday.

In the last few years, the need for
computers has been increasing.
Every term, Pitt gives out permis-
sion 25,000 times, mostly to stu-
dents, to use the computers,
according to Pitt physics professor
James Bardsley. Bardsley presented
his report to the Senate Committee
on Computer Usage which is co-
chaired by physics professor Paul
Shepard.

Shepard said that planning is at
the formative stage and added that
there are three standing committees
and a task force ‘ of 40 faculty
members working on assessing tne
needs of the campus.

Planning is a major concern
because the present long-range plan
had to be abandoned by the univer-
sity administration because the tech-
nology is obsolete, according to
Shepard.

“The Jupiter computer was sup-
posed to be available,” Shepard
explained, “but that project has been
delayed, and that inevitably leads to
the conclusion that the project was
not in our best interests.”

Bardsley emphasized that no one
knew that thenumber of computer
science, majors and their needs
would grow so rapidly. “Everyone
thought that the rate would satu-
rate,” Bardsley said.

Student demand has increased,
but Pitt is not very far behind as
compared to its peers, Bardsley said,
but added later that the record for
state-related schools is miserable;

“In order to build up the Pitt com-
puter system, there need -to be sug-
gestions and input from the students
and the faculty members," Bardsley
said. “Student involvement is‘
needed, but I’m not sure how to go
about getting it. I’m not sure that
there is as much involvement as I
would like there to be.”

There are presently four students
on the computer committee, and
Bardsley expects that students will
become more involved.

“Another. possibility is to go
before’ the Student Government
Board,” he said. “This is an area

brieﬂy discussed funding and the
recent NCAA conference which

concluded that freshman athletes

should have an SAT score of 700
before being eligible to play on a
team.

“The NCAA did a poorjob politi-
cally,” Chancellor ‘Wesley Posvar
said. He added that the administra-
tion will be looking critically for a
better combination of courses.

Posvar said in his report on the
budget that with the new federal
budget there are a number of cuts in
areas such as student aid. There will
be intensive lobbying to get money

where there Should be student for research and also to have Title VI

suggestions.” ~

Among the questi_ons centering
around the issue of computer plan-
ning, is whether Pitt should ask its
students to supply their own compu-
ters, or if the university‘ should
supply them and then recover the
cost through the students’ tuition.
According to Bardsley, there is also
an important question related to tui-
tion—whether the increase in tuition
should be for all students or only
those using the computers. “These

I are questions that will be coming

up,” he said.

Bardsley told the Sentae Council
that there are 623 computer science
majors in the College of General
Studies and 950 students in the Col-
lege of Arts and Sciences who major
or intend to major in computer
science. Dean Jerome Rosenberg of
the Faculty of Arts and Sciences cor-
rected these figures and said that his
office reports only 600 computer
science majors in CAS. Rosenberg
added that there are five tenured
faculty members in the Computer
Science department.

' In other business, the Council

restored. Title VI concerns interna-
tional education. Posvar said if one
is concerned about national secur-
ity, about the worst to do is to cut
funding for international education.

The Senate also heard reports on
a dental insurance plan for faculty
and staff. I '

Chairman of the Senate Commit-
tee on Health and Welfare, Profes-
sor James Holland, urged the
Council to look at a dental insurance
plan. Vice -chancellor Jack Freeman
said that it was his personal view to
deter the plan until a year when the
economic and ﬁnancial situation is
better.

For the majority of students,
Hillman Library is a place to
enrich one’s education in the
tranquil surroundings that
enhance studying.

For other students though,
Hillman serves every function
but a Library. For these few, the
. library is a meeting place, a social
hall or is some cases, a cafeteria.

“We have had a tremendous
problem in the past in the library
with people breaking rules,”
Karen Adams, Public Relations
and Personnel Director of the
University Library System, said.

Adams cited many of the
problems as: smoking in_non-
designated areas_ and talking.

“We have'even had pizzas

Book At Violaters

delivered to the library,” Adams
said. .

Starting this week, smokers,
noisemakers and pizza munchers
had better watch themselves
because the library has taken
some defensive action. A security
guard has been hired to patrol
the Hillman, Graduate School of
Public and International Affairs
(GSPIA) and Frick Fine Arts
Libraries.

The security guard will be on
duty during the evening and
night hours. It is at that time,
according to Adams, when the
majority of the violations occur.

“We don't mean for the secur-
ity guard to be a punitive meas-
ure, we just hope that he will

Freeze: Good Beginning, But Peace Theory Needed

<_,,,,. 2.
Vb“

By PEGGY FERRI

The nuclear freeze ‘movement is
important because it is the first sign
of real involvement on the part of
the American public for a long time.
It is also a mindless movement
because it has modest aspirations to
an arms freeze when it could also
focus on disarmament, according to
Pitt ‘political science professor
Richard Cottam.

Cottam stressed, however, that it

is still a good beginning but added 7

that what is needed now is a good
peace theory.

Cottam spoke to the Pitt Arms
Race Study Group yesterday on
“The Real Focus: American Ostpo-
litik.” The group meets every Tues-
day at noon in the English
‘department to discuss various

’ aspects of the arms race.

A Cottam asked the group several
riddles, only ‘one, concerning the
Europeans, which he could answer.
“What happened to the anti-war
movement of the ’60s?” he asked.

He said that the movement asked
basic questions and came to the con-

7clusion that the U.S.S.R. was afraid

of the U.S. and vice versa.

“We found that they (U.S.S.R.)
were not very aggressive and
thought that we could work out a
detente,” Cottam said. But he
pointed out that the period when
Henry Kissinger was secretary of
state was not detente if detente is to
T>e—c_orisidered as having a sense of
motion. ,

Whopper, reg. fry & med. soft

“I read an editorial in The New
York Times entitled ‘Waiting For
Henry,’ ” Cottam said. “But do we
really want him back?”

Cottam listed several events that
happened under Kissinger. Among
them, Cottam said that Kissinger
prolonged the Vietnam War by four
years. Operation Phoenix, which
was a U._S. project which killed
40,000 people in the Vietnam War
was what Cottam considered geno-
cide. Of those people, 20,000 died
while Kissinger and Richard Nixon
were in office.

Focusing on the present, Cottam
asked the group _why the Europeans
are less willing to increase their
defense budgets and why their peace
movements asked political and fun-
damental questions.

“The answer,” he told them later,
“is that the Europeans have realized
that they can live with the U.S.S.R.
Fear ofthe U.S.S. R. is down in West
Germany and fear of West Germany
is down in the U.S.S.R.”

Cottam outlined the .steps that
brough Europe and the U.S.S.R. to
the present state of affairs.

“First,” he explained, “if you want
to move toward peace, then the

worst place to start is arms control." T

In arms control, both sides are
concerned that neither dies as the
result of a technological accident,
but this ignores the real danger of
accidentalpolitical war in Third
World areas, according to Cottam,
who is also an expert on the
Mideast. '

“The dynamics of arms control

tension,” Cottam said.

He argued that this approach has
to be expanded and proposed sev-
eral ways this could be done and the
goal of detente reached.

Trade and economic interaction is
one way to reach detente. Cottam
explained that to do so would
strengthen the hands of those in the

"Soviet bureaucracy who are inter-
ested in consumer goods and not in_

military ventures. -

“Political cooperation in settling
Third World disputes is another
way,” Cottam said. He called such
cooperation in the Mideast a low
risk test of Soviet intentions and
stressed that Soviet proposals for
cooperation should be explored
before they are dismissed like many
others made by the U.S.S.R. since
1968.

“Excluding the U.S.S.R. from
Camp David is vintage cold war -
the U.S.S.R. and the Mideast are
close geographically.”

Another means to reach detente is
for the U.S. to have a policy to
remedy the Sino-Soviet disputes,
according to Cottam.

“The worst thing that we can do is
exacerbate Soviet fears through
playing our China card,” Cottam
said. The China card refers to U.S.
efforts to use their regulations with
China to “bargain with the Soviets.
Soviets. ' _

“It would be best,” Cottam said,
“if we work out relations with China
that have nothing to do with a mil-
itary alliance. We should do what we
can to alleviate tensions.”

In order to develop a trust
between the U.S.S.R. and the U.S.,
we should move in the direction of

disarmament, according to Cottam.

“The reason that the Europeans
have the relations that they do with
the U.S.S.R. is that they have
already tried everything that I have
outlined here," Cottam said.

He said that Europe, especially
West Germany, has tested what he
said and that is why European atti-
tudes are what they are. The results
of the tests have also been the basis
for major policy changes.

“The Europeans have asked them-
selves if they can live with the
U.S.S.R., and they have found that

they can — I have an empirical base
for my optimistic judgments,” Cot-
tam said. ‘

The freeze movement must there-
fore broaden its horizons, according
to Cottam.

“I don’t see this emerging,” Cot-
tam told the group, “but it has to
come out of the freeze movement.”

Cottam added later that the freeze
movement's moves in the direction
of making the freeze a political issue
in the next elections and supporting

candidates who stand for the freeze .
are ways that this can be achievedxjk

Funding Increases

continued from page one

“In order to balance our budget, it
is clear that revenue shortages from
the state will have to be made up
through cutting costs and increasing
funds from other sources,” Jack

' Freeman, senior vice-chancellor for

the administration said.

Freeman stressed that the com-
monwealth appropriations only’
make up less than one-third of the
total university budget. Additional
revenues come from tuition, federal
and private research grants and con-
tracts, private contributions and
endowment income.

Freeman said that next year, stu-
dents will indeed feel the impact of
the lower increase. in their bank
books

“This modest increase of 2 percent
in state funding will mean a tuition
increase for_ our students, placing an
additional burden on them and their
families, and -placing further
demands on our student aid pro-
gram,” Freeman said.

Pitt was expecting anywhere from
a 0 to 4 percent increase in Thorn-
burgh’s 1983-84 budget proposal.
The 2 percent increase falls in the
middle of its expectations, but fails
to keep up with the inﬂation rate of
3-4 percent.

The bulk of this proposed funding
will be channelled directly to the
General Education Fund. The

remainder of the funding will be..-

divided among four other sectors of
the university-—-dental school, medi-
cal school, Titusville branch and stu-
dent aid funds.

Thornburgh recommended a $349
million tax increase in order to erase
this year’s deficit and pay for next
year’s funding hikes. Some of the
new taxes proposed include a 6 per-
cent sales tax on items such as
cigerettes, alcoholic drinks, asprin
‘and candy bars, and a 4.5 percent
severance tax on oil and natural gas
production.

According to university officials,
the lower increase is due to the

depressed economy and the ramif_i.~[ .

cations of unemployment.

Work Study Funds Increased

By PATTI VISHINESKY

Despite President Reagan’s cuts
in financial aid, the funds for federal
work-study programs will increase
this year by $62 million.

Daniel May, assistant director of
student aid, said the Reagan Admin-
istration proposed a cut back from
$528’ million this year to $398 next
year. To the surprise of everyone,
however, the program was increased
to $590 million.

May said also he expects an
increase for Pitt. Currently, there
are about 900 students in the pro-
gram. With the expected increase,
this number could increase by 150
students. '

“The program has always received
strong support on both federal and
university levels,” May said.

Its’ support on the federal level, he
said, is because it provides work for
students to help pay for their educa-
tion. University support is received

for two reasons. The first, May said,
is that the number of studies indicate
that students on work-study have a
higher probability of graduation,
because they become more involved
in the university and academic
community.

Secondly, the students are valua-
ble employment for the departments
in which they work because they
accomplish much of the work that is
assigned to them.

Sandra Murphey of the student
aid office, said the federal ‘alloca-
tions that are received includes fund-
ing for all branch campuses.

To get into a work-study pro-
gram, a student must fill out a
Financial Aid Form and indicate on

the form whether or not he/she -

wants to be considered for financial
aid.

If a studenrqualifies, he/she is
placed into a job, set on a payroll
and is paid monthly.

dent to student," Murphey said, “A
student receives a flat amount per
year according to need."

For example, if a student is to
receive $800 a year, he/she cannot
work more hours if they have
already fulfilled the alloted time.

For every dollar a student receives
on the program, a percentage of it is
federal and a percentage is univer-
sity money. Because of a loss by the

university lst year, for every dollar a‘

student receives, this year, 60¢ is
from the federal government and
40¢ is from the university.

Murphey said the jobs available
to students are both on and off cam-
pus. Every department within the
university, except the registrar,
employs student on work-study,
May said.

Wages range from minimum wage
to a maximum of $4.10 an hour. If
an increase in federal funding is
received, the wage scales may
change next year.

eradicate the problems," Adams
said.

Adams said that she hopes
that the guard will be able to curb
the habits of students and
instruct them on the rules of the
library. The guard will enforce
rules (no littering, eating or
smoking in nondesignated areas)
in a friendly but stern manner,
she said.

The library system is taking

other measures to deter the
breaking of rules. The lower lob-
bies will be furnished with tables
on which students will be able to
eat. Several smoking rooms have
already been established and stu-
dents can continue to use these
facilities.

“People are really not sensitive
to the fact that there is not always
much room to study in,” Adams
said. “When one group starts to
talk, the noise carries throughout
the entire floor.”

raised its price of admission to $2 for
adults and $1.50 for children due to
an increase in operating costs for the
multi-purpose complex.

The institute, which houses the
Carnegie Museum of Natural His-
tory and the Carnegie Museum of
Art (Sarah Scaife Gallery). has
never denied admission to visitors
who cannot afford to pay but is ask-
ing the paying public to be more
generous in their admission dona-
tions. Formerly, adults were asked
to donate $1.75 and children $1.

Michael McGrael, director of
development for the institute, said
that the basic cost of keeping the two

museums open is approximately
$20,000 a day.

“Costs are increasing,” McGrael
said, “and this amount is what we
need just to keep our exhibitions
going. It doesn’t include the cost of
special exhibitions and new
programs.”

With a staff of 450 employees that
include professional scientists, cura-
tors, researchers and museum per-
sonnel, the institute is maintained
largely through private funding.
Less than 9 percent of its money is
from federal sources, and McGrael
said he does not view the recent fed-
eral cutbacks in cultural endow-
ments as threatening to the institute.

“Both museums apply for project
grants from the federal‘ govern-

amount to a relatively moderate surri
of money——about $35,000 a year.

McGrael added that no federal
money goes to operating costs, only
to special projects, and that these are
now more difficult to obtain under
the current administration.

The county and the state have
been generous with operating sup-

port, McGrael said, but with the‘

increase in maintenance costs, some
of the responsibility must be shared
by the residents of Pittsburgh as
well.

_ “We hope to communicate that
it’s only fair for the public to bear
some of the financial burden,”
McGrael said.

Much of the financial pinch is

being felt in the institute’s Museum
of Natural History, where acting
director Dr. Mary Dawson says that
activities are being cut back.

“We have had to reduce our scien-
tific breadth somewhat," Dawson
said, “and the part-time people that
we use for projects are being cut
back. But we are maintaining activi-
ties as much as we can.”

The Museum of Natural History,
one of the top five collections of its
kind in the world, according to
Dawson, consists of an exhibit
department, an educational depart-
ment and an extensive scientific
department that collects and pre-
pares specimens for for exhibit.
With the reduction in staff, the
scientific department is falling
behind in preparing specimens for

future exhibition. Dawson said that
the remaining staff is doing the work
that previously had been distributed
among a larger team.

One of the problems that the
museum will be addressing is the
reduction in public attendance,
which Dawson said is lower these
days because people are travelling
less.

“We will have to, through visible

. programs and a greater diversity of

programs, make ourselves more
appealing at a grass roots level,”
Dawson said. “We must become
more active in the community.”

Dawson added that with greater

community visibility, the institute.

should benefit from more active
financial support from the public.

The education department, for
example, is preparing a variety of
new and traditional courses for
children and adults at the institute
this spring. A three credit course,
“Introduction to Museum Science,”

' will now be offered every winter

term afthe institute. -It" will attempt
to cover every facet of how museums
operate and how collections are
made and managed.

In addition plans for a series of
new, temporary exhibits will be
mounted this year, and Dawson said
a new exhibit gallery on Eskimos
will be opening in the late fall.

The Museum of Natural History
will also have a new director in June,
said Dawson, who has been the act-
ing director since September. .

Imagine a man—made structure
several miles long orbiting the
earth, supplying homes and busi-
nesses on earth with as much
electricity as 10 nuclear power
plants. The satellite might
appear as a large football ﬁeld‘
when viewed through a tele-
scope; this field would be made
up of solar panels that would col-
lect the clean and unending
energy of the sun.

Sound like something out ofa
science fiction book? There is a
group of entrepreneurs who
believe that these solar satellites
could become the earth’s main
source of energy in the very near
future. ..

They call themselves the L-5
Society, an international organi-
zation which advocates space
research and colonization.

Dale Amon and Dr. Stephan
Schulick are the organizers of the
Pittsburgh branch of the L-5
Society. The future of outer
space development offers many
rewarding possibilities, accord-
ing to Amon.

“What we’re concerned» with
right now are the beginning
stages of the development of
space research, which will ulti-

mately lead to space colonization
with orbiting space stations and
stations on the moon,” Amon
said.

The main problem is the
amount of money and time
needed for a project like this to
get started.

Pittsburgh’s L-5 Society has
been together for about a year,
and Amon said that things are
starting out slowly.

“I’m surprised at how many
people don’t know aboutthe
developments in space research,”
he said.

A reliable source of solar
energy is only one possibility of
space research._ The zero gravity
of space offers advantages in

chemical research also, Amon
said. Chemicals mixed at zero
gravity are more pure.

The Johnson and Johnson

this breakthrough, and is cur-

The Pitt News, Wednesday February 9, 1983  I

Open To

 Suggesﬁons

Computers have been on the minds of many at
Pitt since the university announced that it would
undertake a mid-course review of the current
long-range computing plan. Now that the Uni-
versity Senate has begun in earnest to study the
prospects for a new and perhaps significantly
different computing system, it is time for Pitt
students to get their ideas about computing off
their minds and into the open.

The choice of a new computing system will
affect everyone at Pitt and have a lasting impact
on students. The University Senate has putout a -
call for suggestions from all areas of the univer-
sity community. The senate recognizes——and Pitt
students should also recognize——that the stu-

A dents’ ideas are as important as any others in

developing a viable new plan.

It would be only too obvious to say that stu-_
dents concerned about the future of computing at
Pitt should seek a fair hearing for their ideas. The
Student Government Board—which appoints
student representatives to various senate
panels——might be a. good place to start. What is
not so obvious is that every student should con-
sider getting into the action. , T

Students who are familiar with the current sys-
tem can offer invaluable suggestions to the people
who will buy the next computer. They should not
be too quick to assume that faculty and adminis-
trators will understand every problem a student
faces when confronting a computer. Faculty and
administrators will be quite busy in the coming
months insuring that their own problems are
given attention.

Equally important, however, is that students
who haven’t used the computer get involved.
There has been some speculation that Pitt’s next
computer will be available _to many more students
in every academic department. Although today’s
literature student may graduate before a new sys-
tem is in place, his input regarding the potential
benefits or problems of computer access can help
Pitt to better meet the needs of future students in
the field. A

The present activity in the University Senate to
devise a new computing plan may seem unimpor-
tant now. Future students, though, will have
plenty of time to regret a failure by current stu-
dents to answer the call for ideas. ‘

Letters To The Editor

Middle East Hostility  

Dear Editor: ‘

In response to “Israel’s Battle to
Survive" (Jan. 31) I would like to
clarify some of the statement_s made
by Mr. Sindler. I must agree that
Mr. Sindler lacks expertise in for-
eign policy——I might also add that he
lacks an even rudimentary under-
standing of the situation. The ques-
tion here is, to my mind, what is in
the best interests of the United
States? Surely the best interests of
Israel come second to American
interests, as even Mr_. Sindler’ must
agree.

Mir. Sindler’s ‘grim assessment
that peace will never come to that
part of the world is quite true—as
long as Israel continues, to do what it
wants whenever it wants without
regard to its neighbors. or allies,
including the United States.

Israel’s fears for security are a
sham. Israel has the third strongest
army in theworld after the United
States and the U.S.S.R., thanks to
over $30 billion in U.S. aid since
1947. Israel receives more than $2.5
billion in U.S. military and eco-
nomic aid per year, one-half of

which isa grant, never to be repaid.

Apparently, Israel does not want
peace—-Israel wants*Arab land and
domination of the area by sheer
force. This has become increasingly
apparent in light of Israel's brutal

invasion of Lebanon. The massacre »

in Lebanon was not Israel’s first
holocaust against Arab women and
children. Children as young as 11
years old have been killed on‘ the
West Bank for daring something we
take for granted——expressing their
views.

As for the Russians, the Arabs
don’t want to be dominated by the
U.S.S.R. any more than they want
to be dominated by Israel. Egypt
threw the Soviets out, and the Unit-
ed States has‘ military bases in

_Egypt, Somalia and Oman. Israel

itself has begun courting the favors
of the Soviets; thus, suc'.1 acharee bv
Mr. Sindler is prepostero_u_s_.

As far as the state of war is con-
cerned, the Arabs have shown a will-
ingess to cooperate with President
Reagan’s peace plan—Israel has
not. So instead_of blaming the state
of war on the Arabs, let us take into
consideration Israe1’s greed, stub-

borness and disrespect for the cul-
ture, national integrity and human

rights. of her neighbors and their ,5 _u'

children. _ ’

Amnesty International has cited
Israel for violations of human rights, -
including torture of prisoners.AWest
Bank Palestinians have no rights;
they may be arrested without cause
and held in prison without charges
or trial. Another practice used by
Israel against the Arab population is
collective punishment—an entire
community_ is punished for‘ the
actions of a few. This collective pun-
ishment may include ﬁnes, arrests,
curfews and having your house
blown up.

Arabs are also subject to conﬁsca-
tion of their property, which in
many cases is their sole means of

support. They must watch their 4‘

)<.’T.I~' V

centuries-old groves of olives and ‘
oranges bulldozed under to make
room for Israeli settlements.

It’s really about time that Israel
quit blaming all of their troubles on
the PLO and other Arabs and began
mending its cruel and inhumane
injustices against these people.

Selling Some Snake Oil

Dear Editor:

Simply put, it is a tragedy that the
Pitt Program Council paid some
exorbitant fee to Tom Jackson, “a
leading job expert." Anyone who
tells a university audience that
“there is no inherent shortage of
jobs” is, at best, a snake-oil sales-
man, at worst, a liar who knows he
lies.

 0It's true enough that if 15 percent
of the labor force is jobless then 85

\ percent is at work—the positive way

of looking at things. In the Great
Depression, estimates are that 25
percent of the work force was unem-
ployed, so that those 75-25 odds

were pretty good too, or so Jackson —

implies. Today, 15 percent means 15
million jobless (not counting those
who no longer look for jobs) and, if
Jackson thinks this a minor prob-
lem, he is in some other world.

5The president's chief economist
has announced that inflation can
only be controlled for many years to

come if 6-7_ ercerit of the labor force’ _

world, this comes to six to seven
million who must be jobless for the
sake of the country's economic sur-
vival. This amounts to making
unemployment a social duty for
many people. ‘

0Jackson is correct, of course, in
proclaiming that qualifications .are
less important than knowing such
“rules of the game" as how to act
during an interview, but this is a bit
of advice that could be had for a
much lower price. Obviously, he has
mastered the technique.

The fundamental danger in Jack-
son’s argument is that it encourages
those out of work to believe it is

wholly their fault. This has the effect ‘

of making such people feel wholly
rejected, turning them into psycho-
logical wrecks. They need support,
not re_iection—-something that John
Hinckley’s parents learned only
after he shot President Reagan. I
wonder if Jackson ever has a guilty
conscience when he empties the col-

As for the Program Council, a

John Auberle’s Theory Of Government

By ADAM EISENSTAT

“Get government off the people's backs!”
resounds the cry of Reagan and his ilk.
Few embrace this sentiment more

._ .- _,- strongly than 75-year-old John Auberle of g

‘-5 North Versailles. He not only wants govern-

ment off our backs, but out of our heads and
bodies, too.

Auberle, among others, sees the govern-
ment as a profoundly venal disease, conspir-
ing with the police to control and cripple
people with pervasive radio waves. This
intriguing concept is known as “Sting.”

This may sound familiar to those who
have seen a grisly old fellow traveling the
streets of Pittsburgh wearing a body-length
sign emblazoned with a similar message.
Auberle told me his name is Bob Lansbury.
He also said there are others, but no formal
organization exists. These men are simply
war veterans who have each found a peculiar

‘ explanation for their and the world's

an \
\ .

According to Auberle, it is the liberal
bureaucrats in government who are pulling
the strings, and the police are just tools of
those in command. The president is power-
less to contain or abolish Sting. Even more

shocking is the fact that Sting is used all over
the world, with the possible exceptions of
some parts of Africa.

The radio waves so essential to the nefar-
ious workings of Sting are transmitted
underground by AC voltage. This subterra-
nean current is powerful enough to induce
any kind of physical or mental damage.

before his discharge in 1940. They (or It)
caused him enough harm to warrant disabil-
ity compensation, on which he now lives. At
the same time he says that he has been a
political prisoner since 1909 — the year he
was born. He wears a placard around his
neck proclaiming that fact whenever he’s in
public. -

‘These men are reacting to a government that they, along with everyone else,
just don't understand. They've seen their American dream so thoroughly
derailed that they wonder if an American dream ever existed.’ -

“This can cause abortions,” says Auberle.
“You don’t need to go to the hospital for
one. Miscarriages, too.” He claims that six
members of his family were killed by Sting.

To whom do the bureaucrats answer?
“Satan,” says Auberle emphatically. “Why,
he’s the only one who’ll save us. The Lord
used water to drown all of them one time,

. according to the Bible. That was water ther-

apy, although they didn’t call it that then.
The Bible says this is going to be
Armageddon."

Auberle, a veteran of World War II, con-
tends that Sting began harassing him just

Auberle goes on to say that the govern-
ment didn’t start using Sting until 1973, the
year he discovered that they were “fiddling”
with him. He explained that AC voltage was
discovered in 1880 by Nicole Tesla, but the
government didn’t “turn it on” until nearly a
century later.

Well, which was it: 1909,1940 or 1973? It’s
hard to say since most of Auberle‘s thinking
is riddled with contradictions. He was in the
Klan, but he believes that blacks are God’s
children like everyone else..

As obviously misled as John Auberle
seems, it would be a big mistake to dismiss

him and his radio-wave-tainted brethren
simply as Bible-thumping paranoids. ‘

A, probe of their rabid absurdity reveals
that they are just crying out for attention.
Their deviance is a plea — a plea for help
from the clutches of anonymous govern-
ment machine, whose cogs seem to crush
people arbitrarily.

Auberle spends much of his time handing

' out literature and spreading the word about

Sting. The tortured old crusader says this
isn't wholly voluntary. “They pester you so
damn much you always got it on your
mind.”

Is John Auberle, and those who hold sim-
ilar beliefs, any less sane thanthose who
subscribe to the illusion of democracy —'
damos kratein, the people rule? These men
are reacting to a government that they, along
with everyone" else, just don't understand.
They’ve.seen their American dream so tho-
roughly derailed that they wonder if an

American dream ever existed. If it does, they ‘

believe nothing short of divine intervention
could re-establish the dream.

Auberle put it best when he poignantly
said, “This is the land of milk and honey that
He gave us. These (people) have taken it
away from us.”

Until Proven Guilty

Dear Editor: T

the Union Address and the Democratic paid
political announcement-'—uh, equal time

"* presentation—that followed it in regard to

~ I

“improving” education in the United States,

I felt overcome by a sense of outrage and

‘ disgust. One week later, my feelings have
subsided to a queasy nausea.

First of all, I wholeheartedly agree that

' our system of education-is in dire need of

reform; and I agree also, as H.L. Mencken
often said, that for every problem there is a
solution that is clear, simple and wrong.

That is a perfect description of Reagan’s and

‘Behind his cloak of compassion,
the president cares no more about
crime victims than he does about the
poor and the elderly.’ *

the Democratic Party’s proposal that
(merely) by increasing math and science in
our school curricula, we will rectify all the
shortcomings of our schools.

In our blind obsession that education
should be exclusively directed towards pre-
paring people to become mere functionaries
in the machinery of society, have we lost all
dignity for its most important element-
people? Since most jobs do not encourage
the discovery of one’s potential or the
expression of one’s talents and creativity,
would not our schools be a good place to

engage in such constructive endeavors? It is \

precisely in this area that most of our schools
stand in the greatest need of improvement.
Instead, our schools are a veritable battle-
ground of cruel and senseless competition.
And it was this mindless spirit of competi-
tiveness that was all too clearly manifest in
Reagan’s and the Democrats’ statements

Back to our schools._The popular trend of
having computers teach elementary school
youngsters is a definite step backwards.
Computers, without any doubt, are a useful

tool in helping organize what would other-

wise be enormous mounds of paperwork.
But no computer can take the place of a
good teacher, who allows for a two-way
interaction with the studentf Statistically
speaking, students may absorb more infor-
mation by using computers as a learning
tool, but they (the students) will not have the
opportunity to synthesize that information
(i.e. raw facts) into knowledge, without
which they can never attain wisdom. Educa-
tion is a process of discovery and inquiry,
something which is greatly encouraged in a
Montessori environment. Though it is the
standard in many European schools, in
America, a Montessori school education is a
privilege reserved for rich kids,

It is not my intention to downplay the
significance of the empirical sciences and
math, but rather to stress the vital impor-
tance of the arts and humanities for all-
philosophers-, computer technicians, artists
and engineers alike——in understanding our-
selves and those around us. Yet, once again,
Reagan’s total lack of concern for the arts
and the humanities (and humanity in gen-
eral) shines right through; and this time it is
with a blinding intensity. Not finding a solu-

,tion to our economic problems. would

indeed be a terrible thing. Not realizing and
appreciating .our own infinite human poten-
tial, like T.S. Eliot’s “hollow men,” would be
downright tragic.

‘By KATHERINE M. BEZAK

President Ronald Reagan apparently has
decided that crime victims are treated
unfairly by the criminal justice system and
have _fewer civil and legal rights than the
persons who commit crimes against them.

' Thus, he has appointed a special panel to

study this situation and to suggest ways in

. which it can be remedied. Or so he would

have the country believe. '

When his panel released its findings, it
became clear that Reagan’s real interest is
not in assisting crime victims, but rather in
severly curtailing—if not abolishing——the
rights of the accused.

For example, the panel recommends
allowing illegally obtained orhearsay evi-
dence to be presented by the prosecution at
.pre-trial hearings and urgesthe dissolution
of the parole system. These and other sug-
gestions offered by the panel are of question-
able value to victims and indicate that the
president’s motive is something other than
offering victims the civil and legal rights they
deserve.

The president’s panel, by its very sugges-
tions, seems to have forgotten that a person
is presumed innocent until proven guilty of a
crime, is to be granted a fair and speedy trial
and is to be protected against cruel and
unusual punishment. The panel will not
serve the victim bytaking away the rights of

_ the accused.
I speak, not as a member of the social A

services, nor as a representative of a group
such as the ACLU, but as a recent crime
victim.

Last December, a borrowed van contain-
ing almost all of my possessions was stolen.
After losing almost $6,000 worth of goods,
my earthly belongings now consist of a suit-
case full of clothes, a backpack and a pair of
sneakers. I have slowly and bitterly come to

accept that I will probably never see any of
my lost items again.

This ordeal has shown me how few rights
I, as a victim, have when compared to the
rights of the man accused of stealing my
property. Now that he is in custody, I am not
allowed to ask him to whom he sold my
furniture and motorcycle. I have been told
that if he is forced to repay me at all‘-which
is unlikely—it will be for‘a token sum. Still,
my rights will not be increased or improved
simply by denying him his.

The president and his special panel have
no interest in giving me, or any crime victim,

‘in our blind obsession that educa-
tion should be exclusively directed

towards preparing people to_

become mere functionaries in the
machinery of society...’

assistance or rights equal to those of the
accused if their real intent is to strip the
accused of his rights. I resent the use of my
status as a victim for that end.

I agree that the criminal justice system
does not do enough for those of us who are
victims of serious crimes; while the system
bends over backwards to ensure the rights of
the accused, it is unresponsive to the needs of
the victim. '

Although I am bitter about what hap-
pened to _me and the position it put me in, I
want justice—not the kind of vengeance that
the president’s panel proposes.

'l‘he admission of illegally obtained ‘evi-

dence does not really give me any more I

rights than I already have, and surely even
Ronald Reagan must realize this. Behind his
cloak of compassion, the president cares no
more about crime victims than he does
about the poor and the elderly.

Research

The Office of Research:
Doing Pitt’s

‘Primary Mission’

In addition to the education of its
students, the University of Pitts-
burgh possesses another obligation
not known to the majority of the
student population—its research
duty.

Like any other place of higher
education, Pitt has a faculty that is
interested in making contributions
to society. Pitt’s faculty has
researched and made break-
throughs in areas from the sciences
to the humanities. -

How does a faculty member go

about finding significant, pressing
areas to research? Moreover, where
does the funding of such a project
originate?
’ Answers to these questions and
many more can be obtained through
an office virtually unknown to Pitt
students—the Office of the Asso-
ciate Provost for Research, located
in k the Gardner Steel Building
(corner of O’Hara and"Thackeray
streets). ‘ -

The Ofﬁce of Research is divided
into five areas of concentration.

Administration: For general for- -

mation and designation of inter-
“office responsibility areas.

Liaison and Information Servi-
ces: This section, headed by Shirley
Jones, identifies faculty interests,
needs and capabilities in relation to
research, indentifies funding sour-

. ces and special funding opportuni-
ties, transmits information about
external funding opportunities to

-appropriate administrators and
. faculty, provides liaison with state
. and federal government funding

agencies and provides information

on private fundingsources (corpo-‘

rations and foundations).
Program and Proposal Devel-

. opment: Under the direction of Dr.

Leonard Kuntz and Dr. Al DeRoy,
this office provides guidelines for
proposal preparation, coordinates
institutional and multi-disciplinary
proposal development, consults

with faculty (in workshops or indi-

vidually) on proposal development
and facilitates new interdisciplinary
research and development efforts.
Sponsored. Projects Adminis-
tration: Headed by John Thomp-
son, it assists faculty with agency
guidelines and budget preparations,

reviews proposals for conformity
with agency and university policies,
monitors commitments of univer-
sity resources, negotiates contracts
and reviews, accepts awards and
advises and assists in post-award
matters such as audits, budget mod-
ifications, equipment disposition,
etc.

Implementation Services: Dr.
William Nelson aids researchers in
the effective utilization of grant
funds, acts as a liaison between uni-
versity service offices and principal
investigators, monitors the availabil-

wish to have studies done in areas
they feel are pertinent to the welfare
of society at large—for example, the
Depatment of Defense puts out an

, edition of Highlights.

Before “Dr. Z” selects the area he
desires to research, he must first
obtain some type of funding. Subse-
quently, with the aid of the Office of
Research, he submits a proposal
and sends it to the army—only after
the proposal is checked and signed
through the Office of Research. This
is a university policy.

If “Dr. Z’s” proposal, which is
something of a “research paper,” is
approved by the army, he will then
receive an award (the amount of
money the army wishes to give for
that specific aspect of research).
The amount of the award varies with
each case. In 1982, a total of
$61,295,667 was spent on research
projects at Pitt.

“Research is a costly endeavor,”
said deputy associate provost Leo-
nard Kuntz.

Kuntz also pointed out that not

.only do individuals submit propo-

 

ity of government surplus and
excess property of potential value to
researchers and aids in locating on-
campus research equipment availa-

ble for shared use.

For example, a faculty member in
medical science is interested _in

. doing research in his area of exper-

tise, so he looks through Highlights,
a weekly publication that lists the
areas that need to be researched
immediately.

The Highlights pamphlets are
issued by specific departments that

Weinschecker photo.

“Dr. Kuntz ‘looks;-through research books.

’ By George, I think we’ve got it!’

sals, but groups of interested
researchers do so as well."

When the word “research” is
mentioned, one of the first things
that comes to mind is the ultimate
cure for the big disease.

Not to lessen the impact these
researchers have on society as a
whole, it must be remembered that
there are many important studies
being done in all areas.

I-cant think of any area without
research. Take Shakespeare, for
example. There are always being
new techniques such as frequency-

of-use or authenticity which can be . .-

looked into,” said DeRoy.

Not only is the research benefical
to the public, but the student body
at Pitt is often able to learn of an
instructor's discoveries, especially if
the project is pertinent to a class
agenda.

Kuntz said that there is generally
no conflict between research and
the responsibilities of teaching. A
good deal of the time, the research
projects are long-range; they some-
times take several years — to
complete.

“The primary mission of the uni-
versity, along with teaching and ser-
V198. are people deeply concerned
with advancing the inquiry of knowl-
edge,” Kuntz said. “We would like
to think that many will have part in
benefiting society.

“The Pitt faculty determines the
interest in research and accomplish-
ment. The Ofﬁce of Research is here
to help out in any way it can, if a
faculty member should enlist our
services.

The Medicine Men

While cancer is being studies
and advances are being made in
the detection of breast cancer,
one disease, which is a leading
cause of death in the United
States, remains a major fear
among people. That is heart
disease.

One way of treating the
patients is to have a catheter, a
small tube, threaded from a vein
into the right side of the heart.
The catheter has a latex ballon
which acts as a bumper, and it
will follow the blood ﬂow and
allow blood samples to be taken.

Evaluations of the pumping sta-
tus of the heart can then be

made. .

“This is standard procedure,”
said James Shaver of the univer-
sity’s-cardiology department. “It
is an outgrowth of catheter tech-
niques developed in the 1950s

'and has been standard proce-

dure for at least 10 years.”
Presbyterian Hospital has
been one of the leading centers

. in the nation for the treatment of

heart disease. The first heart
transplant in Pennsylvania was
performed’ at Presbyterian in
1968. _ V

Surgeons began again in 1980,
and since then, there have been
more than 30' transplants per-
formed. In 1982,. Presbyterian
became the second hospital in
the United States to perform a
heart-lung transplant.

Another advancement in car-
diologyhas been the develop-
ment of streptokinase, a drug
that is successful in treating
most heart attacks.

Pitt professors have also made
advances in, neurosurgery. An

operating room at Presbyterian

now contains two pieces of
equipment: a CAT scanner and

.a ﬂuouroscope. These two pie-

ces_of radiological equipment are
used in conjunction with surgical

guiding devices" to perform‘

stereotaxis-guided brain
surgery. I

Peter Jannette, M.D. chair-
man of the department of neuro-
surgery at Pitt, and L. Dade
Lunsford, M.D. assistant profes-
sor of neurosurgery and radiol-
ogy at Pitt, are responsible for
the operating room.

Doctors in the infectious dis-
ease department are developing
vaccines against numerous
infections today. There are six
doctors at Presbyterian Hospi-
tal, three at Children’s Hospital
and three at Montifiore working
on different programs.

Dr. George Pazin is working
on treatment for oral and genital
herpes and is trying to publicize
a study on topical interferons.

“One importance of clinical
studies,” said Dr. Pazin, “is the
recognition of new infections
through examining patients.”

It is this recognition that in
1978 facilitated the beginning of
the findings of Pittsburgh Pneu-
monia Agent, a type of Legio-
naires’ Disease. Dr. Dowling and
Dr. Pascul of the infectious dis-
ease department are working on
this form of pneumonia.

“Up until 1978, when we first
isolated it, it was an unknown
organism,” said Dowling. “We
had no idea to what category of
bacteria it belonged.

. As it turns out, Pittsburgh

Pneumonia Agent was a type of -

the original Legionaires’ Disease
that started in Philadelphia. Now
we can say that it is a slight var-
iant. The finding of it is an exam-
ple of the interplay between
clinical medicine and research.”

This type of pneumoniais sim-
ilar to cancer in the sensethat its

victims’ immunity systems are
suppressed due to the treatment
given for the disease.

“We had seen four patients
who had developed pneu-
monia—either they died or we
obtained a piece of lung tissues,
and a piece of bacteria was
found. But nothing grew out of
the bacteria,.” Dowling said. “It
happened a few more times, and
then we ground the bacteria into
eggs to try and get something to
grow out of it—it was while inoc-
ulating the fifth patient’s lung
that we located the organism.”

At the time the bacteria was
discovered, it was thought that
there could be no infectious dis-
ease that had not been detected.
The finding of a second type of
Legionaires’ Disease proved this
false. '

“Science is not infallible, and
we keep our eyes open,” said
Dowling.

Some new cures and injec-
tions have recently been found,
but not all of it deals with
humans. -

Dr. Charles Brinton. is one

faculty member studying
immunity to bacterial diseases.

“The reason is that, when I-

was working at Pitt in graduate
studies in 1949 to 1950, I disco-
vered a structure of bacteria that

ff-

on the surface had little hairs, -‘

ria had these things. There was
no knowledge, concerning
them,” Brinton said.

In studying bacteria, one must
find the virulence factor_—that is,
the bacteria’s ability to cause dis-
ease. Quantitatively, the goal is
to discover how many bacteria
cause disease. .

The prevention of disease is
achieved by specific’ antibodies

‘linked to the different variance

factors, he said.

Brinton is currently working
on several vaccines, one of
which is a vaccine against gonor-

- and we found that lots of bacte- .

rhea, which is being tested in the ;.

South Korean military.

Gonorrhea is the cause of ste-
rility of many women in the sub-
Saharan regions, Brinton said.

He is also working on a way to
stop the infant deaths in develop-
ing countries.

“We’ve also just developed a
vaccine for pigs. It is a diarrhea
vaccine that is injected into the
mother’s milk. We tested it on
3,000 pigs and have had 100 per-
cent success. We’re satisfied
with it, and so are farmers; they
were losing 10 to 15 percent of
their pork crop.” '

Still, there is no cure for the
common cold.

“I wish to God there was,”
Brinton said.

With all the research activity
at Pitt’s medical school, that may
not be too far into the futv ‘

With the amount or medical
research done at the University
of Pittsburgh, it is no small
wonder that facts and findings
are continually updated.

One of the better known find-
ings at Pitt was the polio vaccine,
discovered by Jonas Salk. Since
that time, various areas of medi-
cine and medicine-related stu-
dies that demand the constant
attention .from the medical com-
munity have opened up.



An area that is vital to many *4...»-;‘“*'

important—it is a foundation for

P Since only a minority of people
can contribute, organ procure-
ment is a special department. In
order to donate vital organs, a
donor has to suffer brain death.

“We’re dealing with a small
segment of deaths in the United
States,” said Brian Broznick of
the University of Pittsburgh
Transplant Foundation. “Less
than 2 percent of the population
dies under brain death.”

Interest in donating organs
can be expressed by visiting area
hospitals.

“We deal within a 120-mile
radius of the university, where
we talk to physicians and they in
turn talk to their patients,” Broz-
nick said. “A patient has to be in
fairly good condition——no
cancer, no prolonged history of
diabetes and no stomach
infections——to be able to
donate.”

The age range for transplants
extends from six months _to 55
years. It is donations for children
that cause problems.

“It is hard to find donors for
infants since not that many die:
brain deaths,and they must also
be compatible with the organ
recipient. For example, in liver
transplants, the patient must be
compatible in blood and weight
with the donor,” Broznick said.

Currently, area hospitals are
working on kidney, liver, heart

and heart-lung transplants, with
an interest in pancreatic and
intestinal tract transplants devel-
oping over the next year. All
transplant surgery is done on
animals at first.

“Even after successful human
operations, work will be done on
animals to make perfections,”
Broznick said.

While vital organs are being
sought to improve bodily func-
tions, some doctors at Pitt have
been doing research to stop
cancer from spreading through-
out the body.

Dr. Bernard Fisher is chair-
man of the National Surgical
Adjuvant Breast and Bowel pro-
.ject, which includes scientists at
70 research institutions in the
United States and Canada.

Findings from the research
project have enabled women
who once would have died from
breast cancer to have a
markedly better chance of survi-
val- through specialized drug
treatments.

The combination of drugs that
is used is tamoxifen, L-
phenylanine mustard and 5-
ﬂuorouracil. Though drugs are
beginning to increase survival
rates, one out of every 11 Ameri-
can women will develop breast

. cancer in her lifetime, and more
than 35,000 women will die from
breast cancer this year.

Science: New Horizons

/

Science-rela_ted research. p_ro-

jects being done at the University
of Pittsburgh are among the
most important in the country
and may someday have alarge
impact on the lives‘ of many
people.’ . _
Pitt is_ a leading figure in
national research and _has
received much attention for

some of its more notable pro-'

jects, such as organ transplants
and planetary studies. Dr. Leo-
nard Kuntz from the Research
Liaison Office said that Pitt is a
member of the prestigious Asso-.
ciation of Research Universities

‘and is ranked 28th’ nationally in

total monies spent on research.

The majority of science
research done at the university is
in medicine and high technology
studies. This is not unusual,
according to Al K. DeRoy of the
Office of Research. “In Pennsyl-
vania, there is now a shift to
high-tech funding,” he said.

The trend toward high-tech
research is, for the most part,
related to the high growth of
these industries, and in this area,
the creation of new jobs is what
everyone is looking for. The
school of Engineering is involved
in many of the projects, which
include the automated inspec-
tion of micro-chips, surface
science and coal cleaning.

Projects such as the inspection
of micro-chips are important to
almost everyone. Micro-chips
are tiny circuits in computers,
calculators _ and most advanced
technological devices. An inspec-
tion system would -help spot
faulty chips before they are used
in instruments.

The surface science project is
investigating a process by which
adhesives can be checked to rate
their quality, according to
DeRoy. Such a procedure, if it
had been available at the time,
cculd have solved‘ the tile adhe-

sion problems that stalled the

space shuttle program.

-Another project is a coal-
cleaning project that could some-
day make coal much cleaner for
utilities to burn.

Projects at the university
include "many" fields‘, but the
emphasis on medicine here at
Pitt can be attributed mostly to
the resources and people here.
The fine medical staff at the uni-
versity gives Pitt the opportunity
to investigate unique projects in
frontier medicine fields.

‘The ﬁelds of bio-technology, I
along with pioneer medical pro-
jects, have made Pitt a leader in
science research. ” '

The much-publicized organ
transplants performed in Pitts-
burgh are now being followed by
unique double organ trans-
plants.

“These multi-organ trans-
plants are done only here at
Pitt," DeRoy said.

A project which is also unique
is the Center for Environmental
Epidemiology. This is a rare pro-

~ gram throughout the nationally

and is headed by Dr. Edward P.
Radford. __

According to Radford, “This
project protects people and
creates legislation. “He added,
“Regulations do come from
epidemiology. At least, that‘s the
intent hoped for."

People may not find any par-
ticular benefit to themselves,”
Radford said, but the final test
will come in areas such as cancer
and heart disease. -

The center is trying to find

answers by studying the environ- 2
ment and finding relationships v

that will find cures.
The rate of heart disease has

gone down a great deal in the last I

five years, and environmental
epidemiology has played at least
a marginal role, Radford said.
The future for this project and
this young field in general is
good, Radford said. “There will
be a time when cancer will
become rare.” He added that the
elimination of the cigarette
would greatly increase this
possibility. _
Epidemiology seeks only to
find answers, but ‘according to
Radford, the program many
times meetsresistance. The ten-
dency to “let sleeping dogs lie” is

. the s¢!=¢ta,1.inclina!i¢n. $9: the 

future, '

'r_-,-_’‘'',, .I...,'.. ‘.

resistance that the program
encounters, Radford said.

An interesting aspect of the
project is that it has economical
and political impact in almost
every study it undertakes.

“It has gotten to be a real hot
issue,” Radford said.

This is a problem for the pro-
gram because it makes funding
much more difficult when people
are in opposition to the work
being done.

The center was created in 1969
and has grown slowly since. It
usually handles about ten pro-
jects on a continuous basis.
Faculty from the university,
make up the staff and the center
is headquartered in university
facilities. »

Much of the work being done
currently is involved with
hazardous wastes. The center
will host a symposium in May
that is entitled “The Evaluation
of Health Effects From Waste
Disposal Sites.”

Radford said that there is not a
real public understanding of
these types of projects, but when
accidents occur, “people want
action and they want to know. ‘If
all the studies proposed by lay
groups were done, you could use
the whole national budget on it.”

Another medical project that
is also important is the National
Adjuvant Breast and Bowel
Cancer study. This project is
receiving a great deal of money
for a nationwide information
collection, DeRoy said. .

“Project grants for the univer-
sity are currently around sixty
million dollars and are stretched
out over 1200 different pro-

0 grams. Funding as a whole has

leveled off in recent years’, due
mostly to cuts in the humanities,
but the funds given to science
research have increased a small
amount.

Some projects receive a lot of
attention, but “(Some) projects
don’t always have the impact of
larger projects,” Dr. Kuntz, from

I -the Office of Research, said.

Some of these projects, like
experiments which deal with
homing pigeons and the earth’s
magnetic fields, have brought
notoriety to the university, but
Kuntz said that the majority of
the work done here is,.“A lot of
good, solid research that's
important."

Some research that is cur-
rently underway may discover
whether our universe is contract-
ing or expanding. The Allegheny
Observatory, which is part of the
university, has one of the finest
and old telescopes in the world.

The Observatory has been tak-
ing pictures of the sky for almost
a century, and these pictures will
be fed into a computer so the
movement of stars can be
calculated.

The number of projects in
recent times is moving into defi-
nite areas. The information
explosion of the recent past and
the advent of the computer have
given research a direction for the
future.

DeRoy gave his prediction for
the future by saying that any-
thing high-tech or dealing with
computers will usually receive
grants.

He added that bio-technology‘
and aging will receive attention.
He said that geriatrics, aging-and

gerontolos)’. the socialogical _

study of aging, will become
prominent fields of study in the

Dr. Fisher in the Office of Research

Defense Research:

No Waste Here

Although many of us don’t
understand the specific aspects
of research, it’s no secret that
Pitt puts a lot of time—and
hundreds of thousands of
dollars—into it.

“One of the real advantages of
research at Pitt is that it helps us
fulfill our primary mission,” said
Dr. Kuntz of the Office of
Research, “to be the frontier of
knowledge.”

If you don’t know quite what
that means in terms of work in
the laboratory, you may under-
stand (and even be interested in)

: what it means in your home or at
. your favorite vacation site.

For example, studies in deter-
mining the circular pattern of the
earth’s upper atmosphere can

aid in the reliability of the televi- V

sion program transmissions.

Did you ever notice the
amount of waste in the water?
You probably haven’t, but
through research studies, scien-
tists can actually turn some
waste water into useful fuel
energy.

Dr. Manfred Biondi, a profes-
sor of physics and astronomy, is
currently working on several

- research studies that deal with
understanding the upper atmos-'
' phere’s

response to energy
inputs from the sun.

Biondi said that there are only
modest effects of his research
that affect the individual, like bet-
ter television signals, but that
getting a basic understanding of
the relationship between the
upper and lower atmospheric
levels can possibly help in the
future to predict weather pat-
terns more accurately.

Biondi has carried out his
work not only at the local
observatory in Loral Ridge, but
he has also worked in Alaska,
Florida and the equatorial
regions. He will be travelling to
Peru this Friday to continue his
work. V

“The study is a remote
ground-based" testing of the
upper atmosphere to determine
its circulation (how the patterns
of the earth’s atmosphere move,
tides, temperature changes, and
in the ionized region, the iono-
sphere, the measurement of the
growth of unstable layers),”
Biondi said.

The upper atmosphere’s
ionospheric layers control the
propagation of electromagnetic
waves to many frequency
bands—radio, TV and FM.

‘ This affects things like transo-
ceanic radio communications or

relay-synchronized satellites,

Biondi said.
He said that if the ionospheric

. .,__.layers-.f.became. -unstable. spon-

taneously, which they do at
times, they can disrupt these
types of radio communications.

“We want to try to understand
what it is -that makes them go
unstable,” he said. What they
measure is but one of the bits of
information needed to solve the
puzzle. ,

If we know about the upper
atmosphere in its natural state,
then we can predict what would
happen to the atmosphere if a
nuclear weapon were to go off.

“That certainly is the aimvof
the Defense Department, being
interested in this are.a,’.’.Biondi
said. “What we’re after is an
understanding of the natural
atmosphere or one in which man
has disturbed it in a very benign
way.” _ , . * .

When it comes to what the
advantages of research are, he
said, “The question is, is it- an
area where we would really like
to advance our understanding?
To try to understand our envir-
onment, the earth, is of course
interesting.” ' f

Biondi is not the only person in
the university who feels this way;
there are many other studies
going on at Pitt that concernour
environment. . '

Dr. Yeun Chen Wu, a civil

engineering professor, is cur-. .

rently studying wastewater
treatment technologies.

Wu is working on the waste-
water treatment known as the
fixed-film biological (FFB) proc-
ess, in which there isa rising
interest.

Wu said that the growing
interest is a result of the fact that "
the FFB process costs less and is
more efficient than the conven-
tional process, known as the
activated sludge system". Sludge
is the precipitated solid matter
produced by water and sewage
treatment processes.

Though widely accepted and
used now, the activated sludge
system has problems other than
constantly rising costs.

Wu said that this is a growing
technology, although at this
moment, there are not many
people doing research in the
field. ~

- Research projects in the field
of defense get their start when a
professor or an interested party
makes an unsolicited proposal
determining the. particular type
of research they want to do.

An outside organization, like
the National Science Founda-
tion (NSF) or NASA or one of
the Defense Department agen-
cies, will award the necessary
funds if it is sufficiently interested

in -the proposal.

“We think‘we’ve got a good shot
to go to_ national championships,"
Dyba said. “We’ve been put into a
tough pool what with Ball State and
Ohio State to play.”

_ Despite his fears, Dyba is posi-
tively anticipating his venture into
Pittsburgh.

“We’re looking forward to going
to -Pitt,” he said. “Over the years,
we've established a good rapport
with the players and even have a
little rivalry going—a good interna-
tional rivalry."

But Pitt may not be the team to
beat this weekend, considering the
records of the other schools invited.
And even though Dyba has yet to see
the likes of Ohio State, Penn State
and Pitt this year, he can accurately
judge how narrow a tightrope he will
have to travel to come out on top.

“Look at the competitive level of
the teams showing up," Dyba said_
Penn State will probably be the
NCAA representative for the
playoffs from the East. And Ball
State and Ohio State are likely to be
the representatives from the
Midwest.

It was the experience of Syracuse
versus the youth of the Panther bas-
ketball team. For once, inexperience

’ won out as.Pitt upset the 16th

ranked Orangemen, 85-74,‘Monday

-ffnight at the Fitzgerald Field House.
_ ‘The victory marked the second time

that the Panthers have upset a
ranked team this week. _
Forward Clyde Vaughan had 24

 points despite an off-shooting night.

‘But. the stars of the game were two

A .lost souls sitting on the bench: guard
‘ George Allen and‘ forward Matt
 Miklasevich. /

Miklasevich was forced into the

"=-‘center position as Andre Williams,

‘i:'Trent Johnson and Keith Arm-

strong each fouled out. The seldom-
“used freshman contributed seven

rebounds in II minutes of play and

showed the poise of a seasoned

veteran.-
Meanwhile Allen,who was placed_
on the sidelines due to the outstand-
‘Ting "shooting of Joey David,put on a
‘show for the sell-out crowd. Withl 1
minutes ‘remaining, Allen’ took an
outlet pass and had clear sailing to a
two-hand reserve slam-dunk, giving
Pitt a 52-46 lead.

“Earlier, I wasn’t trying to create
anything,” Allen said. “My game is
putting the ball through my legs and
shaking and baking."

The reverse dunk was almost

' upstaged by Allen several minutes

later. The 6-0 guard went up to the
front line and tried to slam off a
rebound. He missed, and was called
for a technical for hanging on the
rim.

 

The Pitt News, Wednesday Februaryi9\, 1983  4

“I tried to dunk it so hard thatl
missed and I looked down and Leo
Rautkins was underneath 'mie,”
Allen, said. “_I held on‘ so that _I 
wouldn’t get hurt.” ‘ ‘

Of_fei_isively,. Rautkins, a 6-8 for-—
ward with a deft passing touch, was
superb, hitting‘ 10 out of 15 shots
from the field, good for 24 points.
But Rautkinps also had 10 turnovers,

many of them travelling calls,and _

perhaps most important,=“no assists.

. . Infact, the'OIangemen, who have:

regularly averaged over 20 turnovers

_ a game, lost the ball 25 times,.a‘-fi‘g- 

ure Syracuse coach Jim Boeheim
was not pleased with.

“We made_ ourselveslook pretty ;

bad tonight,” he said. “I find’:it ‘diff_i-’
cult in coaching to shoot the ball for"
my players or handle it for them.”

Boeheim was very displeased with
the performance of the Orangemen
yseniors. Forward Tony Bruin h‘ad"_l3.

points,_but he shot only one for seven _

from theiifloor ‘as Pitt concentrated
on him.

“I was [disappointed that some of _
our seniors didn’t play as well,”-he‘
said. “I felt our guards did a terrible
job. We didn’t stop Allen or Culbert-
son from penetrating.” ‘ _

Despite the dismal performance,
Boeheim hadipraise for the Panth-
ers, a team Syracuse defeated by 21
points. at the Carrier Dome earlier
this season. ’

“Pitt worked real hard," he said.
“They forced us into some turnovers
that we haven’t been making. They
fought like hell and we gave them a
chance. Their guards are doing a

I By BARRY ZASLOFF

The situation demanded a hero,
someone who could turn a heavy.
force in the opposite direction with
his bare hands. Mighty Syracuse
had fought back from an 11-point
deficit to narrow Pitt's lead to 48-46
midway through the second half.
The Orangemen were yanking down

rebounds as if they owned stock in
the glass bank boards; the Panthers
were growing weary, like boxers just
before being hit with the knockout
punch.

So Pitt coach Roy Chipman
watched intently from his corner,
glanced into.his crystal ball and then
called on Matt Miklasevich. “A
hunch,” Chipman would explain
afterward. Sure was, for until Mon-
day night,. Miklasevich had per-
formed as if he were playing in an
icebox. He was the subject of laughs
and fans’ comments that he was just
another Great White Hope.

But sometime after Miklasevich
found a Superman outfit and before
Pitt had upset Syracuse Monday
night, 85-74, the laughs became
standing ovations. Miklasevich
grabbed six second half rebounds-
many of which came in critical
situations—and he was largely
responsible for Pitt's fourth consec-
utive Big East win.

“He played super...he’s really an
animal on the glass...he was bangin‘

some people out there tonight,”,-'

Chipman, said afterward. “We
thought that if he could grow
another two inches, he’d be another

John Pinone (from Villanova), but V

maybe he doesn’t have to grow two
inches.” _ '

It sure didn't seem as if size were a
problem. Miklasevich was playing

as if he belonged in the Big East,

rather than in cold storage. His 6-7,
220 lb. frame was leaping giants in a
single bound. For the first time since
coming to Pitt, Miklasevich lived up
to the billing that he earned at
Franklin Regional High School.

‘‘I‘m ‘getting confidence back in
my game," the Panther freshman
said in a soft tone. “I’m learning that
I can play with the guys in this
league."

His words grew even softer, barely
audible to the group of reporters
that, for the first time this season,
was huddling around his locker
room stall. He lowered his head, dis-
playing a certain degree ‘of shyness.
A Clark Kent after the fact.

-“My brother talked ‘ with me
before the game and said, ‘Just go
out and play with confidence,’ I just
sat down and thought about it.”

Which proved successful. With
Pitt leading 48-46, Miklasevich
pulled down an offensive rebound,
fed a pass to Billy Culbertson and
watched as Culbertson sank -two
foul shots. ’ V

A minute later, Miklasevich
grabbed " a defensive rebound,
heaved a long pass to a breaking
George Allen and observed again as
Allen reverse-dunked the ball
through the basket. The momentum
was back on Pitt’s side. Syracuse
was being crushed by a bad dream
named Miklasevich.

“I was just happy to come off the
bench," Miklasevich said. '“The
coach had confidence in me, so I
decided to go out and play like I can.
I was put in a situationvwhere I had
to perform, where I had to have con-

explained. “Then ' it becomes a men- ‘

ﬁdence. I couldn’t be intimidated by I J"

the Big East.” '—

He wasn't. Miklasevich played the
role of intimidator, rather than inti-
midatee. He had some eyes‘ popping
out of heads throughout Fitzgerald
Field House. He was, perhaps, a last
resort which brought life to a team
showing early signs of suffocation.

“We didn't have another man to
play the post,” Chipman said. “We
felt that we needed an aggressive
player out there. '

.‘‘Up - there (Syracuse), we were
beat on the boards," Chipman
added. “We were really concerned
late in the second half. We started
playing their game.”

Which is when Miklasevich began
playing his game.

TheM_Pitt News, Wednesday February 9, 1983

By MIKE SIBERINI

Panther diving coach Julian Krug
cites two reasons for f reshman‘Mark
McCormick’s quick rise to the top of
the Pitt diving team.

“It's a combination of quick learn-
ing and a tremendous amount of
work, ” he said.

Since the beginning of the season,
McCormick has increased his point
totals from 22.5 to 326.4 in the one-
meter diving event and from »l9l.65
to 314.25 in the three-meter. Both of
his high scores were set in last Fri-
day’s contest with Cincinnati and
earned him a berth in the NCAA
Championships in March.

His performance in the low board
was also good enough to break Scott
Winkler’s 1980 school record by
over three points.

“I couldn’t be more pleased with
his scores, ” Krug said. “This is
ahead of anything we could have
expected _at the beginning of the
year.”

,McCormick first” took up diving
in his sophomore year in high
school. His scholastic career was
also marked by a quick rise as he
managed to qualify for the WPIAL
Championships his first year,plac-
ing seventh his junior year and
second in his senior year. The latter
earned him a berth in _the State
Championships where he took third.

Because high school divers only
use the one-meter board, McCor-
mick naturally is more comfortable
at that height than at three meters.

“I have more experience and more
confidence on the one meter, ” he
said. “And you can take more risks
and they don’t hurt as much.”

McCormick received a scholar-
ship to attend Pitt, but it was Krug
that first interested McCormick in

becoming a Panther. The two met at’

a local A.A.U. swimming practice
during McCormick’s senior year at
North Allegheny.

Since he has been at Pitt, McCor-
mick has won seven events, includ-
ing his last five in a row. So far, he is
pleased with his results.

“Yeah, I’m happy, ” he said. “As
long as I can continue the way I have
so far, I311 be happy.” .

As for the rest of the season,
McCormick has set some goals for
himself and the rest of the team as
well. '

‘‘I’m hoping that we (the divers)
do well so we can get the team some
points in the Big East champion-
ships, ” he said. “Personally, I would
like to place in the NCAA’s.”

While McCormick has been
receiving much notoriety, both he
and Krug continue to‘ remind eve-
ryone that the team is not a one-man
show. 5

Freshman John Dusch, Andy
Kraemer and Todd Mulzet, and jun-
iors Mike McCalley and Rex Nord-
heimer have all been improving
steadily since the beginning of the
season.

  McCormick Takes A Dive For Success

“We can really relate to each
other, ” McCormick said. “We see
each other's mistakes and we help
correct them.”

As the young Pitt diving team
gels, their individual scores and con-

tributions to the team will continue
to improve.

Mark McCormick is the leader of .
this squad and perhaps coach Krug
sums up his performance best:

“He’s just a heck of a diver.”

Ujevich, Pitt Swim By\ Kent State

By SCOTT DELLETT

After breezing past Kent State 81-
43 last Saturday, the Lady Panther
swim team is now preparing for the
Big East Championships, which will
be held at Trees Pool, Feb. 17-19.

Pitt took an 80-25 lead over the
Golden Flashes with five events to
go when Lady Panther coach David
Belowich decided to swim the last
events as exhibitions. I

“We swam extremely well, as I
expected,” Belowich said as seven
pool records were broken.

Jan Ujevich broke three records in
the 100-yard freestyle, 100-yard
individual medley and the 200-yard
butterﬂy. Records were also set by
Wendy Morgan in the 50-yard
breast stroke (32.10), Georgia
Spolsky in the 200-yard backstroke
(2: 13.45) and the relay team of Mor-
gan, Spolsky, Nordine Burrell and

said. “We also have started to reduce is-‘r:f

The group who has not qualified

for Easterns. While the third group,
which consists of Sue Heon and Jan

two freshmen, sophomores and
seniors each. “It's not how big you
are, but how big you play." ,

Another Canadian powerhouse,
Winnipeg, is ranked 10th in that
nation and fourth in its league—the
Great Plains Athletic Conference.
Coach Dave Unruh's squad is now
4-4 in league play and 18-22 overall.
He is, however, long on giving any
solid predictions on his team’s even-
tual ﬁnish in the invitational.

“It's difficult to say,” he said, try-
ing to.evaluate his squad's overall
finish. “Right now we have seven
freshmen and four upperclassmen,
so 1 really don’t know what to
expect.” '

Where rival Waterloo is weak in
blocking, Unruh pointed to that key

area as a team strength. He also likes
the fact that the players play well as a
team._ Most .are of the same
experience.

“I guess it would be nice to finish
in the Top 2,” Unruh said. “To do
that we'll have to pull off a Reggie
Jackson and have a couple of Mr.

_ February's.

“We’ll still have a-definite advan-
tage, though. We have played
longer. Thing is, we hear so much
about the teams in the States; we
hear about them, the many names,
and it's all sort of mysterious, but it
sounds impressive.”

SportsBrief  

This was one game that lived up to
its billing.

After two hours of nonstop
action, after 168 fouls—called or
otherwise—after 194 tu-rnovers,
after 95 missed layups and, get this,‘
after 973 missed shots, The Pitt
News basketball team survived a
determined WPGH squad, 60-54,
last Saturday... .

It was a game filled with specula- -

tion. Before the opening tipoff, ru-
mors were circulating that the Pitt
coach Roy Chipman was lurking
somewhere in the Trees Hall rafters,
secretly trying to locate some Big
East caliber players. If such was the
case, Chipman's recruiting ventures
were unsuccessful, but he nonethe-
less saw some great action.

The Pitt News raced to a 22-12
lead midway through the first half.
Early heroics were provided by Dale
“Iceman" Moore, who, after two
consecutive» opening minute baskets,
was heard whispering something
about replacing Clyde Vaughan.
Iceman, by the way, is more of a
.reflection on Moore's shooting per-
centage, than on his ability to hit
clutch shots.

But WPGH‘ closed the gap to 30-

' 28 by halftime, largely on the

strength of Jonathan “All World”
Whaley's ‘assortment of driving
layups and 15-footers. Whaley, inci-

dently, was calling for Ralph Samp-

son. It seemed, at least according to
him, that stiffer competition was
needed.

He got just that in the second half.
The Pitt News combined the quick
hands of Charlie O'Hara with the
shot-blocking of Ray Wuslich to
shut down WPGH's offense. Wha-
ley couldn't find the banking board,
let alone the basket.

Scott “Scooter” Dellett, who
arrived tardy because he was stuck
in game traffic, came on to provide
some much needed leadership for
The Pitt News later in the game. He
scored no points, but his presence as
always, was felt.

year, Coach Dave Husson remarked
about the “better than normal
seaons" his playoff-bound team has
enjoyed.

“We had an excellent recruiting

year,” Husson said. “Right now,

we’re about where I expected we
would be when the season started.
Our outside hitting and setting has
given us a distinct advantage over
other teams because an excellent set-
ter makes it a lot easier for the
hitters.” v
The one real area of Waterloo this
season is blocking, and because of it,
Waterloo may experience periodic
service breakdowns this weekend.

_ Playing anything but impres-
sively, Western Ontario now stands
with a 3-4 league mark, 8-12 overall.

tion and will probably finish third

he now faces a $1,000 fine. By way of
explanation, Sindler claims he
thought the game was to be played at
the Carrier Dome in \, Syracuse.
Holzer said that if Sindler doesn't
have a written statement of explana-
tion on his desk by noon tomorrow,
he will automatically be suspended
without pay for the remainder of the
season. --

behind Waterloo, according to
Coach Vaughan Peckman.

“We would've liked to be one or
two,“ he said, “but our big problem
this year has been a lack of intensity.
We've suffered more from a psycho-
logical standpoint than physically.

“A lack of leadership has also hurt
us, and as a result, we’ve lost most of

"our games by three points."~

When looking at a roster break-
down, it is hard to believe that West-
ern Ontario suffers from anemic
leadership. Two seniors, three jun-
iors, three sophomores and three
freshmen compose his bench. The
mix could not be any more suited for
a coach wanting more wins than
defeats. But the squad achieved the
improbable—a losing season with a
strong roster.

“Even though we don't have a
ﬂoor leader at this point,” Peckman
explained, “we're hoping that during
this weekend, we'll see some intense
competition to get a leader. I find it
hard to think that we'll drive six or
seven hours and not play hard. ‘ '

“It'll be a tough, high-level tour-
nament, and if we finish in the Top
Five I'll be happy. And for us, it's
being played at a really good time.
We're just going to the playoffs, and
we can use this as a good kickoff and
motivator for a nice finish.” _

With those kind of expectations,
Western Ontario will finish anything
but nice. ‘

As Pitt will get a fresh look at the"
imported competition, the Panthers
will also have to face an old
acquaintance—Ohio State. Already
the two split a match at the recent
Penn State Classic, with Pitt win-
ning a game that no one expected
they would; and last weekend, the
Panthers fell victim to a Buckeye
downpour as Ohio State only per-
mitted Pitt 14 points in a two-game
sweep. P 0

Although he may not have been
prepared for their first meeting,
Coach Jim Smoot is ready for any-
thing and everything that Pitt may
have in its playset repertoire.

“If they play their style, which is a
controlled frenzy," Smoot said,
“then they know how to win." .

One possible explanation behind
Smoot's earlier game loss to Pitt
may lie in a lineup switch. He now
starts two setters who grew up as
outside hitters, and as a result, both
are playing well, Smoot said, but
need more playing time since the
position demands experience. "

Ohio State's 5-5 record. does not
lend well for an eighth-ranked
squad. Smoot says, however, that
losses have alreadycometo three
Top Ten. ..teams, including
Pepperdine—-considered the-best in
power-volleyball hotbed._of
California——and Long Beach State.

  WHY wouu) AN MBA
GO INTO SALES?  

BECAUSE IT'S SMART!

The smart MBA can recognize that selling provides an ideal career start. It puts
you on the ’’firing line’’ in a competitive marketing environment. It exposes you to
. the problems and the benefits of your company's product line. It gives you first
hand experience with your customer. And it's a fast track into management.

Many an MBA has started in sales and ended up in the boardroom. But they were
smart. And that means they chose their first employer on the basis of industry
potential, industry strength, market share, product quality and management skills.
That's why a smart MBA in 1983 will look hard at the Diagnostics Division of
Abbott Laboratories. « '

WHY WOULD AN MBA
SELL DIAGNOSTICS?
BECAUSE IT'S SMART!

Diagnostics products enable health care practitioners to diagnose specific illnesses
and the effect of therapeutic drugs on those illnesses. They-are a vital tool in the
field of health care; experiencing a phenomenal growth in market size every year.
A big part of the reason for that growth relates to the products that Abbott
Diagnostics has pioneered in the past five years.

    WHY WOULD AN MBA
SELL FOR ABBOTT?
BECAUSE IT'S SMART!

When you take on diagnostics, you're entering a worldwide market
that will grow from $4 billion to $10 billion by 1990. And you'll be
entering with the undisputed industry leader.

 
 
 
  
  
  
 
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
 

Each year Abbott spends millions of dollars in R&D related to
diagnostic kits and instrumentation. Our advances in fluorescent
immunoassays and enzyme immunoassays has helped create an
incredible demand for these newer, faster products. What's more, the
medical care community knows Abbott for superior quality, pricing,
and product support.

.WHY wouu) AN MBA
INTERVIEW WITH ABBOTT?
BECAUSE IT'S SMART AIQ ESSENTIAL!

The only way to really explore this unusual career opportunity is to
talk with us on campus. Sign up sheets for Abbott Diagnostics’
interviewing schedule are posted now. Meet with our representative
and find out just how promising a career in medical diagnostic sales
can be. If you are unable to interview with us this Spring, please
send a resume to: Manager—MBA Recruitment/Dept. 922, Abbott
Laboratories, Diagnostics Division,*North Chicago, IL 60064.

A The-Pitt News, Wednesday February 9, 1983

Is Bozik Foll°Wl"9   Right Path?

continued from page sixteen

Asked why the men couldn't move
their practice to one of the Trees’
Hall courts for the one day, Billick
said, “Dr. Chipman wanted this
floor because this is where he will
play Syracuse on Monday night.”

True, Chipman had to face a
tough Syracuse squad in the field
house, but he has been practicing in
that facility for over four monthes
now. Is moving practice for one
afternoon going to mean the differ-

\ence between victory and defeat?

And possibly . Chipman shouldn’t
have been looking forward -to Syra-
cuse; he barely beat Connecticut the
next night. s 1. ‘

Some coaches took the delay bet-
ter than others. Burgemasco

shrugged his shoulders and said he
didn't want to talk about the delay,
while the California State coach
Marty Uher praised Lady Panther
coach Elbert Kennedy for “doing a
good job in a bad situation.”

However, some coaches won’t be
as forgiving of the Pitt athletic
department.

“I think it stinks,” Cleveland State
coachiBecky McKee said. “The girls
come in here up, and now they sit for
four hours. It is hard to get back up
for the meet. They have to sit around
and tighten up, and that increases
the chance of injury.

“Even when I was coaching in
Indiana, I heard about the Lady
Panther Invitational. It was some-
thing special to go there. Now I
bring the girls and this happens. We

won’t be back next year. If we have
to hold a meet ourselves we will,
because I won’t bring the girls back
to Pitt,” said McKee.

Unfortunately for Pitt, competi-
tors may not be the only ones who
don’t return to Pitt next year. A few
track enthusiasts, parents and sup-
porters wereion hand to witness the
fiasco on Friday, supporters needed
to help the Lady Panthers to become
a force in the Big East.

Although Kennedy refused com-
ment on the problems caused by the
delay, one can only wonder how he
felt seeing weeks of preparation
wiped out by a four-hour break.

If Bozik were sincere in his pledge

tice to have priority over a meet. If
he doesn’t, he will slow—if not
stop—the development of Pitt into
an all-around athletic institution.

However, it appears that he
intends to turn the athletics depart-
ment into an accounting office
where only those sports that can
turn a profit get to compete and all
others go the way of women's -field
hockey and men’s volleyball.

For the sake of the athletes who
give their time and energy for the
chance to compete for Pitt, maybe
Boz_ik will keep his pledge and
change those policies that led to last
weekend’s incident. I hope .what
happened to the Lady Panther track

team will never happen again at Pitt.

If we’re lucky, these changes will
happen, but don’t hold your breath.
