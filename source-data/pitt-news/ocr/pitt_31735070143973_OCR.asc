McCoy, Pitt  Navy in Annapolis

by Mike Gladysz
Sparta Editor

ANNAPOLIS, Md. . -
The Navy defense just didn’t
seem like it could slow Pitt
down. And by the time it did,
the game‘ was all but over.
Pitt tailback_LeSean McCoy had
three touchdowns, all in the first
half, and LaRod Stephens—Howl—
ing added two more to help lead
Pitt [54] to a 42-14 win at Navy

‘  '7f[4—':3] on Saturday afternoon.

The Navy ‘defense couldn’t
stop the,Pitt offense, giving up

' 354 ﬁrst-half yards and 499 for the
. game. _The defense allowed Navy
just 251 yards and gave up only one .

second-half touchdown, which
came in the game’s ﬁnal minute.

_ “We got our butts whipped,”
said.Navy coach Ken Niumatalo—

4 _ lo. “[The Pitt coaches] did a good

job of getting their players ready.”

Navy scored on the game’s first _

offensive possession when Shun
\X/hite took a Ahandoff 46' yards
to the right side to even the score
at seven. Its second touchdown
came after Navy corner Rashawn
King intercepted a Bill Stull pass
in the endzone and returned it 91
yards to the Pitt 8-yard line. Navy

' g--quarterbackijarod Bryant scored

on a quarterback‘ keeper the next
play, cutting the lead to seven.
But the Navy offense stalled the

rest of the way, and the defense -

couldn’t stop the Pitt running

game, leading to a 35-14 score at
the half in favor of Pitt. _

g “It was the, first game all
year that I felt like we were re-
ally hitting on all cylinders,”
said Pitt coach‘ Dave Wannst-
edt. “I thought our guys from

-the opening gun until ‘the end

played _with a lot of energy.”
Pitt scored on ﬁve" of its sev-
en first-half possessions, tearing

through the Navy defense on
the ground. McCoy only rushed
four times for 28 yards in the

‘second half before leaving the

game. McCoy finished the game
with" 156 yards on‘ 18 attempts.
He had a 58-yard touchdown‘ run
at the end of the second quarter
— the longest for him this year.

“He probably ‘had as good’

a week of practice as any play-

ers,” said Wannstedt of McCoy.
“Shady made some great runs.”

But while the Panthers’ run-
ning game thrived, Stull struggled
to ﬁnd a rhythm. Stull completed
15 0f__23 attempts for 255 yards,
one touchdown and two intercep-
tions. Before Stull’s ﬁrst intercep-

tion of the game, the Panthers_

were.a perfect 20 of 20 in the red
zone on the year.

Students make a difference

by Tamara Braunstein

For T be _Pitt New

Few people. knew what exactly
would happen on the ﬁrst annual Pitt

Make a Difference Day on Saturday,
but many showed up ready to make
whatever difference they could

.“None ofusknewwhatwewere

getting into,’ ’ said senior Anthony Sftisi.
“But we’ve been  out any aggres-
sion on the plants”

At the Vanucci Park project site, two

busloads of students to clear out

overgrowth and illegally dumped debris _
in the  section of the—Beech-'
view Greenway. Despite the physically ‘.

demanding nature of the work, the
students remained positive toward their

, goal

Those 80 students were only one
partof theinauguralPittMakeaDif-
ference Day, when approximately 2,000
students throughout the city spent a clay
of volunteering for tasks ranging from

conservationism, to general cleaning
and organizing, to  with ABC’s
Extreme Makeover: Home Edition
The event, sponsored in  part
by the Division of Student Aﬁairs, sent

40 yellow buses loaded with students to '

more  45 locations throughout the

greater Pittsburgh area. The attendees‘

played on the slogan -“the city is our
campus” _ — ‘

Student Government Board mem-

betsRyanHaddadandAmandaReed ?

S coordinated the event after pitching the

idea to Student Aﬁairs back in Febru-
ary. According to Haddad, who ran for
SGB on a platform of improving qual-
ity of life at Pitt, apathy is a major issu
on campus. _ ' ~ ,
“Everyone complains how bad it is,
butwe have ahandinthis. It’s our re-

. sponsibility; it’s‘ our neighborhood, out

campus. It’s our job to maintain it,” he
said.

Pennsylvania Clean Indoor Air Act creates problems for foster parents

On Sept. 11, 2008, the Pennsyl-
vania Clean Indoor Air Act went
into effect. Since that time, smoking
has been banned in most restau-
rants, all state buildings and educa-
tional facilities and almost all indoor
workplaces Surprisingly, this list also
includes foster homes

The law prohibits smoking in
any private homes or vehicles used
for  for children and youth
in state or county custody, includ-
ing foster children. That means that
aslongasthe childisinthehouse,
the foster parents are legally banned
from smoking in their residence.

According to sources in various
placement agencies around the state,
there has so far been little outcry

from smoking foster parents, and
everyone acknowledges that the law
is working for the beneﬁt of the chil-
dren.

But what the law doesn’t do is ac-
count for the fact that many smok-
ers are addicted, and so if a smoker
is caring for a foster child, it isn’t just
a matter of not smoking around
the child In many cases it could be
a major lifestyle adjustment, and it
might be enough to drive people out
of the programs

Agencies such as Every Child
Inc of Allegheny County are already
forcing parents to  pledges not
to smoke in their homes or vehicles
when accompanied by their foster
children. The simple fact is that peo-

ple who might have been  to
host a foster child in the past might

not be  to do so now Because
there is a constant shortage of foster
families for the approximately 20,000
foster children in Pennsylvania, driv-
ing people away from the programs
isn’t a good 

Given that the law itself is un-
likely to be changed, foster parents
are simply going to have to deal with
the new rules But that doesn’t mean
the state can’t help them. For in-
stance, if foster parents who smoke
weregiventhe abilitytotakepartin
a state-funded quitting program, it
could offer them an incentive to quit
smoking and also allow them to stay
active in foster parent agencies.

And because state  is
already given to anti—tobacco edu-
cation and enforcement programs
across the state, starting a program
to help foster parents quit smoking
is not unrealistic

Other solutions could be to 
more financial assistance to non-
smoking foster parents as an incen-
tive for smokers to stop, or even to
refuse smokers ﬁom participation
in foster parent programs until they
quit.

A worrisome aspect of this situ-
ation is that it allows the state to con-
trol how people behave in their own
homes It’s true that foster parents
are  an agreement with the
state when they take in a foster child,

and thus could be  up some of
their rights to privacy
' But the fact of the matter is that
the Clean Indoor Air Act speciﬁcally
bans smoking in public places, and
private homes are not public places
Even though the reasons are good,
the legal logic isn’t. The government
could just as easily ban smoking in
subsidized homes
The state is trying to protect fos-
ter children, but it could discourage
potential foster parents from taking
in children they otherwise might
have. If Pennsylvania really cares, it
should come up with a balanced so-
lution that weighs the needs of the
kids against those of the people who
might care for them.

Uncle Johnny: the right choice

 
    
 

by Lewis Lehe

Watching the vice presidential
debate, I noticed that what candi-
dates say conveys no knowledge
about their positions. An exam-
ple:

IFILL: Do you believe, as Vice
President Cheney does, that the

executive branch does not hold ,

complete sway over the office
of the vice presidency, that it is
also a member of the legislative
branch? ,

PALIN: Well, our founding
fathers were very wise there in al-
lowing through the Constitution
much ﬂexibility there in the office
of the vice president. And we will
do what is best for the American
people in tapping into that posi-
tion and ushering in an agenda
that is supportive and cooperative
with the president’s agenda in that
position.’ I

So, while watching, I started
to imagine what would happen if,
instead of Sarah Palin, my Uncle
Johnny was the Republican VP
pick. Here’s a transcript from an-
other universe:

[SEN. JOSEPH BIDEN,
senatorial, underdeveloped, put-
ters across the stage. UNCLE
JOHNNY, a hulking specimen,
stomps over to where Sen. Biden
crouches, panting like an aged

coal miner with black lung. They J

shake hands. Biden whimpers
in pain like a consumptive Irish
Catholic orphan. The two return
to their podiums.] (

IFILL: The House of Repre-
sentatives this week passed a big
bailout bill. As America watches
these things happen on Capitol
Hill, was this the worst of Wash-
ington or the best of Washington
that we saw play out?

BIDEN: I think it’s neither the
best not worst of Washington,
but it’s evidence of the fact that
the economic policies of the last
eight years have been the worst
economic policies we’Ve ever
had.

IFILL: Thank you, Senator,
for rhetorically vomiting on my
question. Uncle Johnny?

UNCLE JOHNNY: I’m not
the governor of Alaska, but I
am the 2002 Masters Mr. Alaska
bodybuilder and won first place
Open Heavy Division at the 2006

Northern Lights Classic. This is
actually true, and I am the young-
er brother of Lewis Lehe’s father.

[A murmur of approval
spreads across the audience like
wildﬁre. From this point on, Un-
cle Johnny is constantly winking
and / or ﬂexing at the carnera.]

IFILL: The subprime crisis.
Who do you think was at fault?
The greedy lenders? The risky
home—buyers?

BIDEN: Well, Gwen, two
years ago Barack Obama warned
about the subprime mortgage
crisis. John McCain said shortly
after that in December he was
surprised there was a subprime
mortgage problem—

UNCLE JOHNNY: That’s
enough, Sen. Biddlywinks. McCa-
in displays the perfect masculine

of pure, shredded muscle mass,

by anabolic steroids. Your accusa-
tions are unfounded and unwel-

ports caps on carbon emissions.
Sen. Obama has said he supports

Americans get the

 
    

by Josh Green
Ca/ummbt

It seems to be the case that ac-
tors get typecast after a successful
ﬁlm performance Shining moments
in cinema lead to repeat roles for ac-
tors who could have had versatile
careers. Every year a rising star is led
into an easy career path,  huge
amounts of money but dying a little
inside after each release.

Nicolas Cage used to show versa-
.tility in ﬁlms  from “Leaving
Las Vegas” to “Adaptation.” Now he
shows his versatility with bad hair-
pieces in ﬁlms  from “Next”
to “Bangkok Dangerous.”

But for every Nicolas Cage, there
is an actor like the great Varney,
who displayed true mastery of meth-
od acting in his Ernest ﬁlms, where
he showed audiences what it would
be like to go to camp, go to school,
save Chiistrnas, go to jail, ride 
slam dunk and even be scared stu-
pid.

According to IMDB, Varney died

while in production of a ﬁlm called
“Ernest the Pirate.”

I think it is important to acknowl-
edge the actors who make the dif-
ﬁcult choice. Many stats today are
saying no to the powerful studios and
agents who force them into effortless
moneymaking and saying yes to true
artistic integiity.

Keira Knightley has made that
choice. In her newest ﬁlm “The
Dutchess,” Knightley plays an 18th-
century aristocrat and wears a corset
This is a distinct contrast to the “Pi-
rates of the Caribbean” ﬁlm fran-
chise, which probably takes place
some time in the 17th century. While
Knightley also wears a corset in these
ﬁlms, she is wearing it while on a
boat.

“Nick and Norah’s Inﬁnite Play-
list” is a breakthrough role for young
actor Michael Cera He has ﬁnally
shown audiences that, aside from his
normal roles, he is also capable of
portraying an awkward teenager who
has trouble  to  It’s great
to see this departure from his normal
routine.

movie Variety they ask for

Young performers like Cera have
an especially difﬁcult time staying
fresh. Frankie Muniz, Haley Joel Os-
ment and the kid from “Jerry Magu-
ire” all learned this the hard way. But
what was their crime? What did they
do wrong? They were small Very
small. People love child actors with
large heads. There is something great
about an actor who looks somewhat
like a lollipop. After their  suc-
cess, these young actors should not
have played characters with such
enormous heads. That was their fol-
ly-

Haley Joel Osment, though,
didn’t necessarily have a large head.
His mistake was getting nominated
for an Oscar

Ithinkitis quite clearwhatthis
versatility in acting means. It means
that regular people are getting a larger
variety of options from our culture
industry After hearing the cries of
moviegoers who want nothing less
than choice, the studios have lis-
tened. ’

Not only do viewers now have
ﬁlms like “Epic Movie” to enjoy, but

there is the choice of “Disaster Mov-
ie,” “Superhero Movie” and even
“Sci—Fi Movie.” Viewers also have
“Saw V” to look forward to. I’m con-
stantly astounded by the freshness of
each successive sequel.

 in November is a ﬁlm
called “Four Christmases” starring
Vince Vaughn and Reese \Wither—
spoon. The ﬁlm is likely to be a de-
parture for Vaughn, who has wanted
to be sarcastic in a movie for quite
some time now

But chances are that most people
know these ﬁlms well. Because the‘
general public is so forceful in de-
 a quality vaiiety of engaging
ﬁlms, these movies that would gen-
erally go under the radar have ﬁnally
found a mainstream audience

There are ﬁlms and actors that are
 ' edthisyear,andwit‘h
good reason. Clint Eastwood is re-
leasing yet another cliche ﬁlm about a
woman who loses her son and is giv-
enthewrongboybytheLAPD.Asif
we haven’t seen this tired plot before.
Luckily it has a limited release

Charlie Kaufman is a well—re—

~ 7

spected screenwiiter who is 
his directorial debut with a ﬁlm called
“Synecdoche, NY.” This ﬁlm is also
being given a limited release Why?
Because the obvious and overused
plot about a theater director who
attempts to create a life—size replica
of New York in a warehouse has
been rejected by the intelligent, deep-
thinking common man.
Congratulations, America. For
years our country’s people have been
ﬁghting against overused movie plots
and stock characters. Because of our
active engagement in choosing what
we consume in popular culture, we
are lucky enough to soon see an a.ni—

mated Larry the Cable Guy cartoon
show.
Larrywill surelybe br ' new

ground with jokes about farting
grandmothers and “ 'ttin’ ‘er done.”
Larry isn’t the only one who is get-
ting  done, though. People of
the United States are as well. So let’s
all give each other a pat on the back
and watch an episode of “Dancing
with the Stars”

Uncle Johnny's debate as informative as the real one

Lehe, page 6

don’t believe you’ve always sup-
ported, Sen. Biden.

BIDEN: I have always sup-
ported it. That’s a fact.

IFILL: \X/ell, clear it up for us,
both of you, and start with Uncle
Johnny

UNCLE JOHNNY: Guys
take leucine supplements to build
muscle mass and stop atrophy,
but Brazilian researchers found
the optimal intake differed in ana-
bolic and catabolic states.

IFILL: Keeping you on your

toes, eh Sen. Biden? How will you
two help America’s middle class?

BIDEN: Let me tell you a
story about a kid from a working-
class family in Scranton who got
to be a senator...

UNCLE JOHNNY: One day
my 12-year-old nephew Lewis
pushed this one bully, who fell
on another bully and gave him a
bloody nose. I told Lewis good
job. I will send every middle-
class family a moose calendar and
salmon every Christmas  if they

pass steroid screening. The mass
does not justify the means!

[The crowd cannot contain
itself. People are throwing their
performance—enhancers to the
ground and stamping them in the
aisles, eyes alight and wild. They
are ready for_a change]

IFILL: It looks like everyone
has heard enough talk, talk, talk
about politics shmolitics. Sen.
Biden, how much balance do you
give to fast—release versus extend-
ed—release protein?

BIDEN: This is insane.

UNCLE JOHNNY: I am
the candidate of Joe Six Pack. I
am the only candidate with a six
pack.

[Uncle Johnny rips off his
suit to reveal pound after pound
of perfectly sculpted abdominal
muscles. Scythes could not tear
them. Women cannot tear their
eyes from them. America is no
longer torn. The choice is clear.
In the months after this debate,
the American people vote Uncle

Johnny unanimously to the ofﬁce _

of Mr. America. McCain, Biden,
Obama —— these names are lost to
history. The presidency isn’t abol-
ished so much as forgotten. Our
problems fade as we train into a
nation beside which Sparta would
be a mere towel boy.]

Now ask yourself: “Do I really
feel any less informed reading this
transcript than .the real thing?”
The mass media does not justify
the means, or your time.

‘I Love ..' loo inward for laughs

by Justin Jacobs
AO’E Editor

I Love You, You're Perfect, Now Change!

Theater Square Cabaret
655 Penn Avenue, Downtown
Perfomwances through Feb. 1, 2009
41 2456-6666

In the course of about two hours, Ted
W/atts Jr. went through more relationships
than most of us have in a lifetime. One
woman hated how much he talked about
golf. One hated how he drove his beloved
car. And one just couldn’t wait 32 seconds
until the Steelers game was over to talk.

No, \Y/atts isn’t a guinea pig in a new
generation of speed dating —— he’s an actor

in the off-Broadway favorite “I Love You, ‘

You’re Perfect, Now Change!” now run-
ning at the small, personal Theater Square
Cabaret in the heart of Pittsburgh’s Cul-
tural District.

Far from traditional theater fare, “I Love
You ...,” written byJoe DiPietro and Jimmy
Roberts, is a collection of musical comedy
sketches exploring the minutia of all types
of relationships, from one night stands to
the death of a spouse.

One of only four cast members, Ted
W/atts Jr. believes the show speaks truth-
fully on love and life.

“I know the feeling of going through a
relationship, trying to make it work, know-'
ing that it’s just not right. I’ve had expe-
riences where I wanted people to change,
or they wanted me to change,” said W/atts.

The cast of "I Love You ..." is,  Kristiann Menotiades, Joseph Domencic, Christine Laitta and Ted Watts.

“And, of course, there’s the experience of
wanting to meet someone new, but being
nervous that they’ll be crazy. My experienc-
es have colored probably every character I
do here.”

But while W/atts’ sentiment is on the
serious side, don’t be mistaken — “I Love

You ...,” here directed by James Brennan,
is full of anything but sappy drama. The
show’s many sketches take twisted looks at
familiar topics, enabling anyone who has
ever loved (or even liked) to find some-
thing relatable.

“Everybody’s got that wink-wink nudge-

Courtesy Archie Carpenter

nudge feel when they leave the theater. You
hear a lot of recognition—type laughter. You
hear, ‘Oh honey, that’s so you,’ from the
stage,” said Watts. “The show is so unique
that it hits everybody in some way.”

It’s no surprise, then, that the show’s
seen such success. \While it opened just ear-

His fans call him Slug. His family calls
him Sean Daley. And a recent naysayer called
him the Dave Matthews of hip—hop.

One of these is not like the other.

For one of the most popular and critically
acclaimed underground rappers (if none of
the above sounds familiar, you’ve probably
heard of his rap duo Atmosphere) to be
compared to the king of faux-hippie rock
might seem like an insult, but not to Slug. In

crawl to the

fact, the Minneapolis MC took it as a compli-
ment.

“I could’ve knee—jerked, but I broke it
down. Sure, from the independent music
nerd perspective, Dave Matthews is the butt
of jokes. But looking at the overall picture,
he’s got fans that love him. That’s beauti-
ful. He’s got a language and he’s speaking,”
said Slug in a recent interview with The Pitt
News. “So where does that put me? It means
I’ve made it. I’m in the books now.”

Talk about seeing the sunny side of life.

And for Slug, who’s made his name in indie

hip—hop over the last decade for his brutal,
truthful and often overtly emotional takes on
his own life, having such a positive outlook
is a new page in his rhyme book. But then

top stops at

again, it’s hard to be down when the whole
underground rap community is pushing you
up.

Atmosphere’s latest record, last spring’s
IV/Jen Lzﬁ Give: Ybu Lemony, You Paint 2‘/mt
S/Jit Gold, is his most successful to date with
partner and producer Anthony “ t” Davis,
having received positive reviews by even the
harshest critics (I’m  to you, Pitch-
fork). Slug’s also cut down on, as he says,
“all the  all the f***' ,” and even
elected to bring his 14-year-old son on tour.
And now, 15 years, ﬁve albums and almost
20 EPs in, Atinosphere is better than ever.

“I used to. do all the press junkets, so
much shit for more exposure  but it doesn’t
help the art at all,” said Slug. “At the end

lVIr. Small's

of the day, f**k it all. My hands are on the
steering wheel, and if I want to crash this
airplane, whenever I decide to do it, I can.
But I’ll never give the wheel to someone else
to ﬂy it higher so more people can see it. If

the planes ﬂies higher, it’s because I took it-

there.”

That do-it-yourself, me-against-the-world
mindset has long driven Slug. After releasing
a set of intensely personal EPs, Atmosphere

‘put out God Loves Ugly (you can probably

guess who Ugly is) in 2002, the duo’s first
record to garner some mainstream attention.
Aside from piano-driven, earthy and rum-
bling beats, it was Slug’s self-deprecating rap-
ping that truly separated Atmosphere from
the countless, faceless rappers of the under-

in organic food stores or farmers
markets, that’s even better.

. - The other exception is produce
that isn’t grown locally. Case in
point: cranberries. Cranberries are
involved in some of the best fall
foods, like cranberry bread, cranber-
ry sauce and even homemade cran-
berry vodka, but last time I checked,
cranberries weren’t harvested any-
where around Pittsburgh. Save the
option of a long weekend road trip
or plane fair —— your only choice is
to buy itﬂom the store.

It’s only fair to state a caveat
here. Buying ﬂesh produce will be
the costliest part of your baking
endeavor. But forthe best possible
result, it’s worth it.

Now, a word about baking uten-
sils. There’s an old adage that says,
“A chef is only as good as the tools
he works with” —— or something to
that effect

Proper bakeware will allow for
more efﬁcient baking and help to
avoid any burnt disasters. For ama-
teur bakers on a budget, glass bake-
ware is a great all—around choice. It’s
not that expensive, and ifs easy to
use and easy to clean. You can serve

ground. The title track begins with, “I live my 0

life like the captain of a sinking ship / Hey
ma, I promise, I’m gonna be large / Someday
I’m gonna stop trying to borrow your car.”

It was that kind of depressive humor that
earned Slug an emo—rapper label and the ado-
ration of sad little punkers everywhere. At-
mosphere even played the Warped Tour 
2004. I 2

But emo never quite fit Slug. Sure, one At-
mosphere track is more personal than Young
]eezy’s entire collection, but these aren’t tracks
about high school heartbreak. The best At-
mosphere tracks resonate with deeper emo-
tions —— self—doubt, crippling fear, addiction
and desire. ' _ I ,

‘‘I’ll never lie in my music. I tell a story,
just like someone tells you that Santa Claus
is real. I’m a storyteller, not a liar,” said Slug.
“Lies have agendas. I don’t have an agenda
— I won’t prove shit to anybody I don’t need
to make you think I’m cool or awesome. ,My
stories are observations, thoughts. You might
agree or disagree —'— I don’t mind, either,_as

p long as you hear it and confront it.”

And his fans do hear it. But for Slug, the
artist—fan relationship is two—way. Stop by the
show, tonight and you’ll see him out in the
crowd. Onstage he’s like a preacher leading
the faithful.

“As a rapper, I’ve got 80,000 bosses in-
stead of one. They’re19 years old, and as I
get older, I see the relationship I have with
my fans turning into something a bit more

 parental,” said Slug. “I want to make sure
that I’m giving these kidsjust what KRS—One
gave me — to not necessarily kiss your boss’s
ass, but to challenge your boss to be better.
I’m gonna confront you to make you con-
front yourself.” .

For Slug, with a teenage son just beginnin
to understand what his dad does, there’s an-
other confrontation that’s waiting to happen,
and it’s with maybe his biggest fan. Luckily,
Slug is ready for it.

“To my son, this is the thing that had dad— I

dy gone a lot. Even though he was too young
to know what resentment is, there’s probably
some of that in him. But after traveling with
me, he hears me talk to a fan about how I
helped them through something in their life.
He sees that connection and he’s proud. As
he gets older, we’ll deal with the things he’s
tucked away  as long as we keep it open, its
gonna be line,” said Slug.

Be it as a father or a rapper, Slug, the
perpetually self-hating MC who, for the past‘
decade plus, has been airing his grievances
on record, is becoming somewhat of an op-
timist. That’s a bold move for the guy who
made his career on being down on himself.
But being clean, being successful and being
at peace with his son — this is Slug’s best day.
And he doesn’t care if you like it or not.

“For some ‘people, we might be the butt
of jokes. Others might not even like rap, they
just like Atmosphere. Some get it and some
don't. We're like syphillis.” ’

for a 43-yard play down the left side
in the ﬁrst half that led to a McCoy
touchdown, then again hitting Bald-

touchdown at the start of the fourth
quarter. Baldwin ﬁnished the game
with three catches for 101 yards and
a touchdown. It was his ﬁrst career

Navy’s Bryant, who was subbing

ﬁnishing with 81 yards on the
ground and only 18 passing yards

and an interception.

Pitt defensive tackle Gus Mus-

out and put on such a strong per-
formance — especially against a team
with such an unconventional style
of play.

“We see a new offense every
week,” said Mustakas. “This is a lit-

had [the bye week] to prepare.”

That bye week helped Pitt hold
Navy to 194 rushing yards — more
than 100 fewer yards than its season
rushing average. The 21 points were
also Navyfs lowest total since losing
38-14 at Notre Datne in 2006.

The Pitt Women's soccer tearn tied Villanova. on Friday in double

Women's soccer

Villanova leaves Founders
Field after scoreless deadlock

by Lauren Kirschman
Staﬁ’ l«l7/rite/'

Even double overtime on Friday
at Founders Field couldn’t decide the
game, as the Pitt women’s soccer team
tied Big East foe Villanova, 0-0. The
overtime game marked the second in
as many games for the Panthers, as
well as their third on the year.

Despite the deadlock, Pitt ooach
Sue—Moy Chin said she felt her team
played well and was  pleased
with her tearn’s control of possession.
Pitt came out strong in the ﬁrst half;
with senior Jennifer‘ Ktitch  the
first two shots of the game

"Theworkratewas reallygood to-
day,” said Chin. “We just have to ﬁnish
our chances”

But it was Villanova that ﬁnished
the ﬁrst half strong Pitt goalkeeper
Moxie Kephart saved two shots during
the periods last two minutes and ﬁn-
ished with ﬁve saves overall.

Pitt’s best scoring chance came in
the 44th minute when Laura Berbert

ﬁred a shot but couldn’t ﬁnish.

The Panthers continued to ﬁnd
scoring opportunities in the second
half but continued to struggle with
 Ashley Habbel started the
half with a shot that sailed wide, and
Villanova goalkeeper Molly Wiﬂianis
saved the next two shots, both taken
by Ktitch.

“We started off the game strong, .

and we continued it in the second
hal£’saidChin. “Wehadnolet-downs,
which was good”

Although both teams had scor-
ing chances in regulation, neither one
capitalized on its opportunities The
trend continued into both overtimes
Vllanova’s best scoring possibility
came in the ﬁrst overtime, when Erin
Hardimen’s shot was blocked and the
follow-up by Laura Sylvester missed
the net The Panthers had a chance to
break the tie in the second overtime,
but V1llanova’s Williams came up with
another save

“Villanova is a  good team,”

said Chin. “We got a point out of the

The game moved Pitt’s recoréig’

The game marked the second-no-
last home game for Pitt and its senior.

Pitt defense sh

by Zack Chakan
Aaaidtarzt Sparta Editor

For one play Saturday, it looked
like Navyfs offense was primed to
give the Pitt defense a relapse of
nautical nightmares from last year’s
48-45 loss.

Midshipmen rurming back Shun
White took a pitch from quarter-
back Jarod Bryant and scampered
40 yards for an easy touchdown on
Navy’s first drive‘.

At that moment, the Pitt de-
fense could have sulked, faltered
and drowned in Navy’s patented
trip1e—option rushing attack, much
like the year before.

Instead, the Panthers got tough.

‘ They got stronger. And they hit

Navy like a cannon, at rapid speed
and with continuous, devastating
ferocity.

When all was said and done, Pitt
limited Navy to 194 rushing yards,
a season-worst for the Midship-
men, on 47 attempts. Navy only
passed the ball eight times.

Pitt’s 42-21 triumph in front of

  

the largest crowd in Navy-Marine
Corps Memorial Sta'diurn’s history
provided revenge for the squad
after last year’s debacle and also
staked its claim as the team to beat
in the Big East.

Pitt’s offense totaled 499 yards,
thanks to LeSean McCoy’s 156
rushing yards and Jonathan Bald-
win’s first 1Q0-yard receiving game.
But that was expected against an
undersized Navy defense.

The real story was the Panthers’
defense.

Dave Wannstedt’s unit gave up
331 yards on the ground to Navy
last year. But defensive coordinator
Phil Bennett had the defense pre-
pared to eliminate the chance of a
sequel.

“I thought our defensive coach-
es had a real sound scheme,” said
Warmstedt. “I think we kept it
simple, and we let some guys make
plays and use the athletic ability
they have.”

Senior middle linebacker Scott
McKillop deﬁnitely wanted no part
of another defeat to Navy.

“It was embarrassing,” said

The Pitt News 0 vvww.pittnews.com

ows it'shere for good

McKillop of last year’s loss. “They
came into our house on national
television and punched us in the
mouth. We looked forward to this
game this year, we had two weeks
to prepare for it, and hats off to
Coach Bennett and Coach Warmst-
edt with the game plan.”

as

"I think we kept it simple, and
We let some guys make plays
and use the athletic ability
they have."

Dave  
Wannstedt

Navy is a good football team
with an impressive offensive
scheme. Coming into Saturdafs
contest, the Midshipmen were sec-
ond nationally in rushing offense,
with 313.5 yards per game, and they
averaged 29.2 points per game.

In fact, the Panthers nearly held
Navy to single digits. One touch-
down came after Bill Stull’s pass

was intercepted by Rashawn King
and returned 91 yards to the Pitt
8-yard line. The other score came
in a last-gasp drive when Pitt’s
backups were on the field.

So, Navy won one play. The
Panthers emerged on top for the
rest.

With this week’s news that out-
side linebacker Shane Murray will
miss the remainder of the season
with a knee  Navy tried to
attack his replacement, Greg Wil-
liams, and fellow outside linebacker
Austin Ransom.

But both played exceptionally
against the Midshipmen. Teamed
with McKillop, the linebackers
closed off outside holes and tack-
led Navy’s runners before they
could get a full head of speed.

‘‘[Williams] and Austin will
have sore knees tomorrow,” said
Warmstedt. “They were chopped.
[Navy] got after them pretty good.
Those guys did a nice job.”

The line stepped up as well.
Without stalwart Mick Williams,
Gus Mustakas had his best game
of the season, making four stops

and clogging the middle so Navy
fullback Eric Kettani never found
room on dive plays. '

' Ends Jabaal Sheard and Greg
Romeus wreaked havoc as well. Pitt
recorded only one sack — Navy only
passed eight times, remember —— 
Sheard’s hit on Navy quarterback
Jarod Bryant jarred the ball loose.
Pitt recovered, and three plays later,
a LaRod Stephens—Howlir1g touch-
down run put it ahead, 21-7.

At 5-1, the meat of Pitt’s sched-
ule lies ahead. Five Big East games
and a showdown" at Notre Dame
loom.

Right now, the offenses of Pitt’s
conference opponents aren’t ex-
actly the most potent. Injuries ‘ravi-
aged Connecticut and Cincinnati at
quarterback. Rutgers and Louisville
have been inconsistent And West

Virginia looks a shadeof its former

self with Rich Rodriguez struggling
at Michigan. ,

Whether Pitt’s offense continues
to pour on the points, the defense
proved it’s here for the long run.

At the ﬁnish line, a BCS game
just might be the grand prize.

Volleyball continues its
rim as Big East beast

by Randy Lieberman
Staff Writer

The Panthers dominated another Big
East foe last Friday to remain in ﬁrst place in
the Big.East with a 7-1 conference record.

The Panthers, despite dropping the first
set of play, bounced back to beat West Vir-
ginia by the scores of 23-25, 25-17, 25-20
and 25-17.

Pitt held the Mountaineers to’ a dismal
.051 hitting percentage and out—blocked
them 12-6 in the match.
