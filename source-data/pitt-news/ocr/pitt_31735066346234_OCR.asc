General Studies

New Majors Added

by RON LOZOWSKI

Five new majors have recently
been introduced in the School of
General Studies. Two of these
areas of study are entirely new
to the University; the other three
were formerly offered only at
the graduate level.

The Administration of Justice
Program attempts to bring about
an understanding of every facet
of the justice system. The student
majoring in this area may choose
to concentrate in one of six
tracks: Forensic Science, Law
Enforcement Administration. Se-
curity Administration. Delinquen-
cy Prevention and Control, Cor-
rectional Administration or Traf-
fic Administration. A seventh. So-
cial Policy Planning and the Legal
Process, is awaiting approval.

The programs are interdisci-
plinary in nature and may in-
clude courses in sociology. psy-
chology. and philosophy, as well
as departmental courses.

According to an adviser in the
school, Charles Pleasant, the
courses “are geared, not specifi-
cally for training police, but for ed-
ucating.” He added that this pro-
gram is not restricted only to
those planning to enter police
work, but is open to all interested
students.

The Urban Management con-
centration is oriented towards
preparing students for adminis-
trative careers in public and
semi-public organizations. The
program is devised with the in-
tent of making students more re-
ceptive to new ideas. and
acquainting them with modern
management methods.

With the constantly rising pro-
duction of and dependency on in-
formational materials. the Infor-
mation Science concentration is
constructed to enable students to
apply information technology to
manage this increasing amount of

 

data. Studies are grounded in the
physical, behavioral. and engi-
neering sciences.

The Distributive-Vocational
Education program is designed to
train teacher coordinators of dis-
tributive education within the
state of Pennsylvania. These in-
structors will then be able to in-
troduce secondary school students
to marketing, merchandising, re-
lated management, and personnel
development topics.

Contemporary USA Studies is
an interdisciplinary program of
studies related to modern Amer-
ica. Courses will be chosen from
the humanities. social sciences.
natural sciences, and professional
schools. The program attempts to
give students a background for ca-
reers in government services
with contemporary settings.

Mentors Join F rosh -
Orientation Program

by POHLA SMITH
News Editor

Mandatory freshman orienta-
tion has been laid to rest.

Previously. students were re-
quired to attend one of several
four-day sessions held in the sum-
mer in which they experienced
dorm living. registered. met with
personal and academic advisors.
and tried, at modest social events.
to meet their classmates. all at a
cost of $25.

This year orientation is option-
al, except for the registration pro-
cedures. Richard Box, Orienta-
tion Committee chairman, ex-
plained that in an attempt to aug-
ment opportunities for meeting
people, all freshmen have been
invited to attend one large orien-
tation and social session Aug. 25-

‘W7

Sept. 1 at a cost of $7. For an ad-
ditional $37.75 dorm students will
be able to live in their permanent
dorm rooms.

Because the preparation of
residences for returning upper-
classmen negated the possibility
of housing for commuters during
orientation, they were given a
chance to experience dorm living
at a weekend session in June.

Mentors Integral

The new optional orientation
was not the only adaptation of the
traditional orientation program.
For the first time, the Mentor
Program will be an integral part.
Mentors will serve as orientation
hosts and hostesses besides per-
forming their regular function of
meeting with freshmen during the

    
 

 

STUDENTS HAVE been asked not to park below the garage on the vacant
lot at the intersection of Joncaire and Boundary Sts. in Panther Hollow.
The University leases the upper section of the lot to provide free student
parking. Paul Popovich of the Physical Plant Division said, “University
Parking” and “No Parking” signs will be erected to mark the boundaries
and the holes will be filled in by fall. The lot is now available for use des-
pite the “No Trespassing” signs posted by the owner.

Draft Deadlock Continues

by DENNIS KLEPPICK

While the nation is still without
a military draft. a Senate-House
conference committee remains
deadlocked over the controversial
Mansfield Amendment to the Se-
lective Service Act.

Mansfields amendment dic-
tates that a "date certain“ dead-
lock" deadline be set for with-
drawal of all U.S. forces from
Indochina. While this amendment
was accepted by the Senate. the
House. which had previously pass-
ed its own version of the draft bill.
refused to accept Mansfields pro-
posal.

The committee. according to
legislative procedure. must pro-
duce a bill that will pass both
Houses in identical form before
the bill can be presented for Pres-
idential signature.

The conference committee,
composed of five U.S. Senators
and seven Representatives, has
already resolved certain differ-

ences between the respective bills
passed by the House and Senate.
In addition to a two-year exten-
sion of the draft, the conferees
agreed to a compromise military
pay boost of $1.8 billion for fiscal
1972. This figure is some $900
million lower than that previous-
ly accepted by both House and
Senate but is still $800 million
over the amount requested by the
Administration.

The conferees have also agreed
to a broadening of the rights of
appeal before the draft boards
and abolish all undergraduate de-
ferments with the provision that
any student eligible for a defer-
ment during the past school year
could complete his college career.

Efforts to compromise on the
Mansfield amendment have been
futile. The anti-amendment
forces. led House Armed Services
Committee Chairman F. Edward
Hebert have maintained that the
"date certain" feature of the

amendment lS unacceptable. In-
stead. they would accept a rider
expressing the "sense of Con-
gress" that the government with-
draw all forces from Indochina.

Senator John Stennis, chairman
of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, pointed out that re-
moving the specific withdrawal
date would provoke a filibuster by
Senate doves and delay passage of
the bill indefinitely.

While the draft has been in leg-
islative limbo. events have oc-
curred elsewhere that could ef-
fect the conference committees
decision.

The Selective Service System
announced last Friday that the
draft lottery for 1972 would be
held "early next month" regard-
less of whether or not Congress
acts to extend the draft by that
time. The New York Times re-
ported yesterday. that the lot-
tery will be held August 5. A
spokesman said the decision to go

ahead was made “because young
men are anxious to know what
their numbers will be next year."

The results of the Army’s much-
touted spring advertising cam-
paign so far have dealt a blow to
President Nixon’s all-volunteer
Army plans. The $10.6 million
campaign netted 4,100 recruits;

.L(Continu€(/ on Page 7)

Box explained that the addition
of the Mentors to orientation en-
courages the mingling of engi-
neering, nursing, and College of
Arts and Sciences students.

“The Mentor Program is such
a very important part of orien-
tation." said Box. “that orienta-
tion could be calledthe Mentor
Program. Eventually, I‘d like to
see them married.“

The Mentors will first meet
with students and their parents at
a Get-Acquainted evening the first
night and then meet daily with
their groups until the beginning of
school. when weekly sessions be-
gin.

John Baginski. special assis-
tant to the Mentor Program. said
the Mentors will be working with
"a more humanistic approach"
than in former years. “The Men-
tors will try to get the kids do-
ing things—both on and off cam-
pus.'.' said Box. They are trying to
work out a method by which Men-
tor groups could design projects
that would eventually gain them
academic credit.

The Mentors have also adopted
a laissez-faire philosophy:
“We’re not trying to pressure the
freshmen into anything. We’re
just trying to make it as attrac-
tive as possible,” said Baginski.

Varied social activities have
been planned. Students will be en-
tertained by the mentalist,
Amazing Kreskin, and by the
Three Rivers Blues Band. An eve-
ning of horror movies and one of
old-time comedy will be featured.
The Inter—Fraternity Council has
planned three evenings of parties.

Serious programs on topics of
current interest to students are
also on the agenda. They include
a panel discussion on Military
Obligations and Alternatives, a
Feminist Workshop, and a tenta-
tive appearance and speech by
Mayor Peter Flah'erty.

Various University services
and student organizations will
have representatives available
for information.

 

A fire causing unknown damage erupted in Forbes Field Saturday

morning.

The blaze. which was first sighted at 6:09 a.m. on the South Bou-
quet St. side of the ball park, was confined to the grandstand area.

Neighbors told police they heard singing and loud music coming
from the Forbes Field area shortly before the fire was seen.

A University spokesman said that though damage was originally es-
timated at $20,000, this estimate would probably be revised upward.

It was not immediately known how the fire would effect Univer-
sity plans to raze Forbes Field. Those plans. delayed since March
were postponed again last week, to more fully consider objections by
Oakland residents to the building's demolition.

  Children’s Museum Sparks Learning

by RUDY TORBICH

The stone-like, mirrored-
front structure of the Pittsburgh
Children’s Museum inspires in
tots the magic of Hobbitt hole fan-
tasies.

The Museum is an experimen-
tal, trailer-sized mobile unit built
to determine the feasibility of a
permanent museum for young
children.

Sophisticated children’s mu-
seums have already been built in
Boston, Brooklyn. and St. Louis.
According to Sissy Rylands of the
Pittsburgh Childrens Museum
IPCMI Committee. future plans
to build a permanent structure. or
another small mobile unit. depend
upon the amount of funds avail-
able.

Carnegie-Mellon University
(C)MU) professors, students,
and graduates. Their member-
ship includes such varied disci-
plines as metallurgy, architec-
ture, engineering, electronics and
art.

"Our purpose." said George
Morris. one of the Museums de-
signers. “is to design education-
al structures for educational pur-
poses that would arouse peoples
curiosity enough to draw them in-
side and then present them with
informative material in a crea-
tive environment."

MIT called these designers‘
combination of art and techno-
logy 15 years ahead of its time.

The outside of the Children’s
Museum is covered with hard
polyeurethane foam giving it a
natural stone appearance. The
front section is cut away and
plexiglass mirrors are shaped
into truncated octahedron forms
displaying the most common crys-
taline structure found in nature.

Chem Ph.D. Grads
F306 J01) Scarcity Students Oppose Hike

by RON LOZOWSKI

Pitt chemistry Ph.D. graduates
are currently experiencing diffi-
culty in finding employment. ac-
cording to a recent survey.

The survey was compiled by
Charlie Falletta. a graduate stu-
dent in chemistry. in conjunction
with the Chemistry Honor Socie-
ty and the department. Question-
naires were returned by 33 of 39
chemistry Ph.D.'s graduating
from Pitt this year.

Falletta said that he and other
students had noticed the prob-
lem. "and feltit should be brought
to the attention of the depart-
ment." He therefore suggested
the survey.

Of the 33 respondents to the
survey, 14 (42 per cent) com-
mented that they either had no
job prospects or were unemploy-

the number that already claimed
employment or jobs lined up-
were engaging in post-doctoral
work.

The other nine students. with
one exception. were able to find
employment within the field of
chemistry. However. in six of
these cases the source of the job
was a personal contact.

Eighteen graduates also sub-
mitted suggestions to improve
employment opportunities. Two
of these have already been ap-
proved by the Chemistry Depart-
ment: (1) the creation of coun-
seling sessions for prospective
graduates, and (2) the creation of
the position of a teaching post-
doctorate. The latter move will
be put into effect this fall.

Tuition Raise Survey

The results of an informal Pitt
News survey show. not surpris-
ingly. that many students oppose
the latest tuition increase.

Last week. the University an-
nounced that full-time graduate
and undergraduate students who
qualify as Pennsylvania resi-
dents will pay $60 more per term
in tuition under the new fee of
$485.

The crucial concern of those in-
terviewed seems to be their abil-
ity to meet the rising costs. Ac-
cording to one girl. the hike “dis-
criminates against the working
class students who can‘t afford to
P33’-

One student remarked that “un-

less you have a scholarship,
you’re hurt.” David Strella, a jun-
ior biology major, noted that “it

will hit the people on the GI bill
hard.”

Tuition for out of state stu-
dents. with the exception of those
in the School of Law. was not in-
cluded in the hike. One student
protested that “those from out-
side the state can go elsewhere.
but in—staters have no place to
go."

A contrasting view was offer-
ed by Dave Kolakoski. a senior
philosophy major. “Out-of-stat-
ers already pay more because
in—staters are subsidized. Out-of-
state students shouldnt be hurt
for the benefit of in—staters. and
shouldn't have to pay more than
what their (out-otlstatersl edu-
cation is worth."

Some students hinted that the
increase had been expected. Bill

Rude

by CINDY MORGAN

You hand the man his brown paper
bag, give him his change, and smile a
polite thank-you.

He steps away, reels around the
points down to the finger-smudged glass
case and orders. “Hey, if any of them
niggers come in here and try to buy one
of them pistols, you be sure to not let
‘em have it." Then he turns in his dirty
green overalls and swaggers away.

People and incidents like this con-
stantly remind you of life outside the
University community in small towns,
rural areas, and yes, in the city just a
few blocks away.

Back on campus, your friends talk
about how deceptive the campus can be.
but you can never really understand
until you leave.

Your college friends are all different.
Black. white, Jewish. and foreign. Many
of your women friends are among the
strongest feminists on campus. And for

servative. your friends are anti—war and
pro equal rights.

They are just friends. You never think
of them as anything else. People are
people, individuals with different person-
alities.

But Home makes you sharply aware of
the differences. Try as you may. you
cannot ignore them.

It starts out slowly at first. but soon
the small minds in small towns come to
your attention. Even many of the college
youth suddenly drop their weekend cam-

Willard: Tepid Chiller

by EVAN PATTAK

$5

Associate Editor

Alfred Hitchcock once made a shocker called The Birds, in
which our erstwhile feathered friends mounted a calculated offen-

sive against mankind.

More recently, Brewster McCloud, from the movie of the same
name, came under the tutelage of a bird-like creature. The duo left
a trail of dung-spattered corpses in their wake.

Now playing at the Stanley is Willard, a tepid chiller that is

sort of a Birds-Brewster gone rodent.

Willard (Bruce Davison) is a 27-year old, mousy clerk who is
buffeted about between his domineering boss (Ernest Borgnine) and
his demanding mother (Elsa Lanchester). He is probably Oedipal
and certainly a failure, so it is no big surprise when he befriends
a pack of rats multiplying in his basement.

Willard‘s troubles proliferate almost as quickly as do the rod-
ents. Mother suddenly dies, and the boss hankers after Willard‘s

house.

In the meantime. however, Willard has been training his hun-
dreds of rats. With an assortment of homemade Skinner boxes. Wil-
lard shapes his troops into a well-disciplined corps of killers.

A revenge-bent Pied Piper, Willard leads his furry assassins
on a carnival of crime, culminating in a few grizzly deaths-by-mum

ching.

That sounds chilling, and it is. The final 15 minutes of the film
are as frightening and gruesome as the publicity blurbs (“the one
movie you should not see alone“) predict. Fifteen minutes. unfor-

tunately, maketh not a movie.

The balance of the film is mild. jaunty, even Disney-like. Sus-
pense and horror are not sustained. they are not even introduced
until the waning moments of the film. The dialogue is at times in-

sipid. at times tedious.

Director Robert Mann and cast add little to the lackluster
script. Davisoii as Willard seems confused, Lanchester is wasted,
and Borgnine is typically volcanic as the rat. of the “employer”

strain.

Willard might easily have been a genuine tingler. had not its
creators tread too lightly probably for fear of alienating the squeeiii—
ish. The film works hard to earn its GP rating.

The rats—no ghetto dwellers. these-are just the cutest things

you‘ve ever seen.

All evil is punished. if by equally evil means.
And, of course. the rats take care of their own.

When he first discovered the pests in his cellar. Willard intend-
ed. to drown them immediately. That shouldn‘t have been necessary.
Willard, is a sinking ‘ship that the rats should have had the good

sense to desert. - »

Writing’s Price

But writing takes its toll. With
insistent force. it yanks the writ-
er from the real world. Consid-
er:

When writing. a person can
pause. wait for divine inspira-
tion . . . and then proceed as if
the words actually gushed f'rom
the spirit. He can retrace his
steps. patch up unseemly flaws,
and present a tidy package or
a stirring piece. sans blemishes
or stutters.

Gradually, the writer deceiv-
es himself. Forgetting the pro-
cess, he comes to judge him-
self by his writing. He ignores
the fact that his writing repre-
sents his potential self, not his
true self,

Soon. the writer loses pa-
tience with banalities. Yes. trite
ideas occur to him, but he does
not put them in print (this writ-
er is a notable exception )5

Later, the writer comes to con-
verse as if he were writing . . .

that arrives in seconds but not
soon enough. because by that
time listeners have lost inter-

not be quick. He must appear
to be lucid or profound. but

not required. '

Damaged Signals
Writing exacts a toll in other

ways. The writer learns to ex-
press emotions through printed

words, without the aid of in-
flections, gestures. chortles,
squeals. and sighs. Eventually,

his ability to express such reac-
tions is impaired. and he is tag-
ged dry, dull, or devoid of flair.

When the writer has a person-
al problem, he can release an-
xiety through writing —~ cheat-
ing himself by escaping. In-
stead of coping with a problem.

l’ris(I/4 /Krutalitics No

by RON LOZOWSKI

"When in disgrace with for-
tune and men‘s eyes,/I all alone
beweep my outcast state." This
phrase. from Shakespeare's
"Sonnet 29." is the source of
the title for the movie. Fortune
and Men’s Eyes, and also sets
the tone for much of the film.

The feature. currently at the
Kings Court. is based on John
Herberts off—Broadway play
(llerbert also wrote the screen-
play). The script offers a scar-
ing indictnient of the brutali-
ties of contemporary prison life.

While the starkly realistic por-
trayals of the perversities and
other atrocities that occur “on
the inside" are often shocking,
and might prove offensive to
certain audiences, such scenes
appear to have been deliberate-
ly calculated with this disturb-
ing intent. The characterizations
are exaggerated, to be sure, but
not to quite the extent the naive
viewer would prefer to believe.

The story revolves primarily
around Smitty (Wendell Burton.

of Sterile Cuckoo fame). a
young man sentenced to serve
six months for his first prison
stretch. His immediate reactions
are fear and despair.

The rookie is assigned a cell
with three otherconvicts. includ-
ing a “tough guy" named Rocky
(Zooey Hall), whose early “big
brother“ image abruptly fades.
as his character is revealed to
be on a level only slightly above
that of the other inmates.

Another roommate is" Queenie.
a homosexual. portrayed by Mi-
chael Greer in a performance
of Academy ‘Award calibre.
Queenie provides cutting humor
throughout the film. taking some
of the edge off the co_urse reali-
ty of life behind bars. Greer's
brilliant effort enables the film
to succeed. for without such
comedy relief. it is doubtful that
the horrors depicted on the
screen would be bearable for
the majority of viewers.

One of the production’s most
amusing incidents occurs when
Queenie visits the infirmary,

imagining paper

capable of

In writing, of course, there is
no dialogue, so he cannot se-
cure feedback. He stays in a rut.
He perpetually mumbles to him-
self, and the echoes are too fa-
miliar to be valuable.

Writing allows the soul to
unburden itself too easily. Once
an idea is committed to print,
the writer senses that there is no
need to store it anymore. So, he
stops turning the old thoughts
over in his head; he doesn't
bother to integrate his strands of
wisdom. Instead, he seeks new
thoughts, new challenges, and
leaves the past behind._ Unfor-
tunately, he leaves behind solu-
tions as well as problems, in-
sights as well as trivia.

In the end, the writer is cor-
rupted. He has created an illu-
sory world of greatness that can-
not be achieved in real life.
Dissatisfied with normalcy, the
writer opts to live in a fantasy
world of near-perfection.

So. beware of the temptress,
for writing is habit-forming
medicine! And. like gin, it over-
whelms the unsuspecting with
sudden force.

Stqrlrcn Stills 2

Stills’ Waters Run Deep

by RON LOZOWSKI

Stephen Stills 2 is apparently a
continuation of 1970‘s Stephen
Stills . . . almost. The difference
is that this follow-up requires a
bit more “getting. into“ than did
its predecessor. A hurried spin-
ning of the album:-could yield un-
duedistress. 

Listen once again. and you‘ll
realize why he ranks in the high
echelon of rock guitarists. The
discs flaws are. for the most
part. minor—the majority of the
cuts are well worth your atten—
tion.

The damaging weaknesses of
this album lie not with Stills——he
misses only in those rare in-
tances when he succumbs to the
current trend towards heavy-
handed guitar strumming. Al-
though a cursory impression
might leave one considering his
songs decidedly unimaginative.
continued contact allows the
tunes to penetrate more deeply.
They grow on you.

The album is faulted, however,
in the backing voices and instru-
mentals. In Stills previous re-
lease, these seemed to be more
tightly integrated with his own

performances; this time they ap-
pear loosely strung together. The
sounds don’t completely mesh.

When the efforts become overly
pretentious. as in "Ecology Song"
and what is probably the disc's
biggest disappointment. "Blue-
bird Revisited.“ the failure is evi-
dent. Nearly every cut on which
the Memphis Horns appear flops.

In addition. the quality of the
voices has declined. The first
disc featured John Sebastian. Da-
vid Crosby. Graham Nash, Cass
Elliott. and Rita Coolidge. With
the exception of Crosby. all may
be labeled among the missing.

Despite such drawbacks, Stills
is capable of "making it“ even on
his own. Country/folk balladry is
his true forte; listen to "Singin‘
Call."

“Change Partners” is a mas-
terfully-done number that was
also a chart single. The flip side,
the driving “Relaxing Town,” is
included as well. Dispensing with
the machinations of his stone-
fingered contemporaries, Stills
ably demonstrates his capacity
for thriving in a hard rock en-
vironment.

“Sugar Babe" is another ex-

THE PERIOD in which a student may exercise the credit-no
entry option will be extended to the T5 class day of each term
(three weeks after the beginning of classes), unless a number of
faculty members suggest that the reform be considered by the
Faculty of Arts and Sciences (FAS) .

The reform, suggested in March by the College of Arts and Sci-
ences Cabinet, was recently approved by the College of Arts and

Sciences Council.

Unless the reform is submitted for consideration to the FAS, it

will be implemented this fall.

ceptional cut. musically resemb-
ling something by Neil Young. al-
though it lyrically falls below the
Gold Rush man.

The only truly mediocre Stills
composition on the album is "Ma-
rianne"—the tune totters on the
brink of bubble gum. The song
would probably be better suited to
a higher voice. and could undoubt-
ably have been salvaged by Gra-
ham Nash.

Yet critics argue that Stills’
melodies display a disturbing sim-
ilarity to one another. The same
may be said of James Taylor but

I guess when you’re hot, you’re hot .

Stephen Stills 2 collapses only

,when Stills drowns in the trou-

bled waters of his supporting
cast. When permitted to flow on
his own, his talent. power. and
versatility pour out. Stills‘ waters
run deep.

Three Dog Night was one of the
top rock bands in the world be-
fore they ever recorded their cur-
rent top hit Joy to the World. The
group was formed in 1968. the uni-
que amalgamation of three indi-
vidual lead singers. Each brought
his own personal style to the
band: Cory from blues. Danny
from Tin Pan Alley. Chuck from
good old rock and roll. Combining
with Allsup on lead guitar. Scher-
mie on bass. Greenspoon on key-
board and Sneed on drums. they
were able to fashion perhaps the
most perfectly balanced rock
group in music today. With such
diversified talents Three Dog
Night could play any style. de-

liver any form and charm any
audience. ..

There is hardly a group per-
forming today that can match the
excitement of Three Dog Night.

Three Dog Night will be appear-
ing at Three Rivers Stadium Sun-
day. Aug. 1. at 8 p.m. Tickets are
on sale at Network Ticket Agency.
located in all National Record
Marts and Three Rivers Stadium
and Ticketron box offices.

“ONCE UPON A MATTRESS”

Once Upon a Mattress, the mu-
sical comedy that skyrocketed
Carol Burnett into the national
spotlight, will open at the Odd-
Chair Playhouse July 21 and run
through Aug. 1.

     

The musical is a comic look at
the "inside story" of that princess
who couldn’t sleep on top of 20 mat-
tresses with one small pea be-
neath. In the role of Princess
Winifred the Odd Chair has cast
Lenora Nemetz who received rave
reviews for her performance as
"angel“ in the Playhouses open-
ing show Celebration.

The cast also features another
fine performer, KDKA personal-
ity Jim Home as the mute King
Sextimus who cannot speak be-
cause of the curse placed on him.
Joining the tongue-tied radio per-
sonality are Paul Greeno as
Dauntless and Peggy Greenberg
as the Queen.

by VINCE DiNARDO

For the Pitt Camaro and its
crew. things have been looking
both up and down. The Camaro
and its driver, Bob Fryer, had
its best performance in three to
four weeks last weekend at the
Pokono Pam Am race. yet their
victory was hotly contested by
the second place finisher because
the Camaro crossed the finish
line while on fire.

The Pokino race, which is
also referred to as the Indy of
the East, was definately, as Fry-
er put it, a "crowd pleaser." Be-
cause. in spite of the fire. Fry-
er and the Camaro broke the ex-
isting lap record of the Pokino
International Raceway by 2.1
seconds a lap.

Curious turns of events led to
both the fire and Fryer's possi-
ble disqualification.

“The fire extended from the
front of the engine to the exaust
pipe," Fryer said. “I had a min-
or oil leak which sprayed on the
exaust pipe. The pipe hit the
ground periodically and the
sparks would ignite from time
to time."

And, from time to time. the
Camaro would burst into flames.

an average cost of $2,585 per man.
The Pentagon has rejected the
Army's request for an additional
$3.1 million until “further eval-
uation of the program has been
made.” The failure of the ad cam-
paign could increase the pressure
on Congress to reinstitute the
draft quickly.

The President has also waived
his emergency drafting powers.
Those powers would have en-
abled him to draft from a pool of
5.5 million previously deferred
men. An Administration press
agent stated the powers were
waived because their exercise
would have resulted in “innum-
erable hardships and disloca-
tions" for the deferred men.
These men. for the most part. are
older men with families and col-
lege degrees.

Meanwhile. the Selective Serv-
ice System carries on its process
of classification. hearing appeals.
and conducting pre-induction phy-
sicals. The Pentagon insists that
the country can carry on several
months without the draft before
the country's defense posture is
adversely effected. All indications
are that it will be some time be-
fore the conflict in the commit-
tee is resolved.

Fryer was called in and the
car was checked in the pres-
ence of an official.

"He said (the official) that it
was all right to go back out."
said Fryer. “and it took me
most of the remaining race to
catch up to the other driver."

Shortly thereafter Fryer saw
another flag and was confused.
Fryer thought that the official
waving the flag from the other
side of the track had not been
notified of his clearence from
the other official and did not
make a further pit stop.

Fryer went on to set his re-
cord breaking pace and finish-
ed the race on top.

In three to four days, Fryer
will know the decision of the of-
ficials.

“It is possible that they will
take the win away from me and
give it to the second place fin-
isher." he continued. “but in
view of the circumstances I
don't think that would be very
fair." '

Fair or not. what would lead
Fryer to take such a chance in
the first place‘?

"I had thought about it." he
said, "but the aggrevation these
guys (his crew) had gone
through in getting the car rea-
dy, I thought, was worth the
risk of damaging the car. if it
could help these guys out."_

“Besides," he continued. "I
was optomistic that it would turn
out allright and I was prepared
if the fire got out of hand. I
would pull the car off the track
and I knew I could get out in
time."

Fryer was delighted that he
had broken Warren Agar's exist-

Youths Use Pitt Facilities

Youngsters from the ghetto areas of Pittsburgh don't have to be
bored any longer by the long, hot days of summer.

The University of Pittsburgh in conjunction with the National Col-
legiate Athletic Association (NCAA) is currently conducting a unique
National Summer Youth Sports Program (NSYSP), a free project for
poverty area children. Using the athletic facilities at Pitt and coaches
and professors from the University, nearly 300 youths are participating
in the program which began June 25 and ends Aug. 6.

The NSYSP provides the youth with a summer recreation pro-‘

gram, and also a chance to participate competively in athletics. In-
struction and competition are offered in swimming. basketball. base-
ball, track, and gymnastics with all Pitt athletic facilities available to

the program.

This marks the third year for the NCAA program on a national
scale, and also the third year at Pitt. It began with a grant from the
federal government to the NCAA, and this year the grant was increas-
ed to $3 million for use in close to 60 cities across the country.

Robert Kalchaler, assistant professor in the School of Physical

Education and director of the
Pitt program, believes it has been
an overwhelming success.

“I think the program is very
unique because it provides oppor-
tunities for University and com-
munity people to relate to each
other," he said. “It affords the
underprivileged youngsters with
the finest instruction and facil-
ities. Our first year at Pitt it was
difficult to get children to join,
but this year the demand was so
overwhelming that some people
had to be turned away."

The program is conducted on a
Monday through Friday basis,
with two hours of instruction and
competition in the late morning.
Then the youngsters are driven to
the Pitt Towers Cafeteria for the
same hot lunch that the regular
Pitt students are served. At

 

least twice a week, following
lunch, the youngsters return to
Trees Hall to listen to a lecture on
a variety of topics chosen by the
NCAA instructors.

Participants in the project were
medically examined at the begin-
ning of the program and every-
one is covered by insurance.

The woman’s lib movement will
be happy to learn that all phases
of the program are open to all
girls, except baseball. The base-
ball program involves 45 boys and
is divided into two age groups. 10-
12 and 13-18. The teams have use
of the baseball fields behind Trees
Hall, the batting cage at the Field
House and the Astro-Turf at Pitt
Stadium. Games are conducted at
least three times weekly.

Damage to the car was not se-

working on the breaking system

to get the car ready for the next’

race.

"We finally seem to have the
power problem licked. he said.
"Right now we're rebuilding the
breaking system which has not
been performing very well."

With the possible win in his
pocket, with his car performing

better. with his power problem.

leak corrected, Fryer seems ea-
ger to get back into action.

He is confident that the Pitt
Camaro can and will be a win-

And why shouldn't he. After

Intramural Increase

Due To Astro-Turf

by VINCE Di NARDO

Environmentalists on the Pitt
campus have put up signs around
newly seeded lawns proclaiming
“Keep Off the Grass." Around
Pitt Stadium. however. intramur-
al director Leo Bemis has been
urging people to do just the op-
posite.

Bemis is just completing a soft-
ball intramural league in which
33 teams played a total of 165
games in two months——all on the
recently installed Astro-Turf in
Pitt Stadium. This breaks down
to roughly four games a day, a
grass killing schedule for most
parks. but no more than a good
day's workout for the artificial
turf at the Stadium.

When the Astro-Turf was in-
stalled, Athletic Director Casi-
mir Myslinski made a pledge that
the entire University community
would haveaccess to it, and ex-
pressed a hope that it would at-
tract people who otherwise might
not make use of the athletic facil-
ities available.

It appears that Myslinski’s of-
fer has been accepted.

The softball league jumped from
20 teams in 1970. to this year's
33,entrants. the most ever in-
volved in the program. Not only
have Pitt undergraduates been
active participants. but also grad
students, faculty members. and
people from the health profes-
sions have taken part.

Bemis feels that the sharp in-

hoses with colored water passing
through. There's a liquid crystal
floor that changes color when
heat and pressure are applied by
the child's body. and a larger cave
room with a wax slide in it. The
rooms are relatively small to in-
crease the interaction of the
child's senses with the materials
displayed.

age.

The Children’s Museum has
been extremely successful in at-
tracting children. Its major
structural defect, the designers
claim, is that the massive amount
of energy found in a large group
of kids and the stress and wear
that it inflicted on the Museum
were not anticipated.

The construction of the Chil-
dren's Museum was financed
by preliminary grants from the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
Council on the Arts and by contri-
butions from several Pittsburgh
industries and foundations.

The Pittsburgh Children's .\lu—
seum will be on display at the .—\l—
legheny County Fair. Sept. 2-6. It
was previously exhibited at the
Three Rivers Arts Festival and is
now visiting various locations in

the Pittsburgh area.

crease in participation is a direct
result of the turf.

“There’s no doubt that playing
on the turf has helped,” he said.
“It’s a great drawing card. Some
entered the league to see what it
was like to play on Astro-Turf,
and it has definitely helped to
maintain interest throughout the
season. The whole atmosphere of
the Stadium is a nice, clean one,
which also helps to draw people.”

Encouraged by the large turn-
out for summer intramurals,
Bemis hopes that the interest will
carry over into the fall program,
which also features touch foot-,
ball in the Stadium.

“I'll tell you." Bemis contin-
ued, "if we could get lights in the
Stadium there's no telling how
large the program would be. We
could schedule night football
leagues which means a lot more
people could attend.“

Myslinski also realizes the val-
ue of adding lights, not only for
intramurals, but for intracollegi-
ate football and soccer. It is high
on his list of priorities.

There may come a time when’

the Stadium is in use from eight
in the morning to ten at night. no
rest at all for the Astro-Turf. In
addition to the intramural pro-

gram. the stadium is open for use ~

by students. faculty and staff
from noon to darkness. seven days
a week.

Tuition Hike

/Continued from Page 3)

Angel, a junior political science
major, said, “There have been so
many increases before, that it
seemed all too likely’ that another
one was forthcoming.”

A few students were resigned
to the change. David Urban. a
junior geography major, argued
that "if the state cuts back mon-
ey. the University must continue
to function."

Another student conceded. “If
you want to go to school. you have
to pay for it."

Albert E. Smith, referred to
as “the first black administra-
tive assistant to Casimir My- .
slinski,” (Pitt News—-July I5)
bears the title Executiye As-
sistant Athletic Director. The
Pitt News regrets its -previous M
lack of specificity.

YOU’RE CRAZY

TO FLYA CHARTER WHEN TWA

CAN GET YOU THERE

As long as the charters were
saving you money, you put up with
all kinds of inconveniences.

You never knew if the plane was
going to leave on time, or whether it
would leave at all. Once you boarded
the plane, 9 out of 10 times, you
found yourself inan overcrowded
situation, or stuck on a stopover
somewhere in Iceland. And when you
finally got where you were going to,
you had to return to the States the
same day as the whole group.

This summer, with the new youth
fares, TWA can get you there for
about the same price as the charters,
but without any of the problems or
restrictions. C

You can fly to Europe for as little
as $199 round trip and return to the
States anytime you want to within
the year.

You’ll get the same seat and
service any full-paying coach
passenger is entitled to. And you can
make a reservation to most places
7 days before the flight, without
having to join any special group or
paying a special fee.

Because TWA flies all over the

  FOR ABOUT THE SAME PRICE.

United States, you can also get there
from any one of 39 different cities.
And with our Youth Passport Card
(for anyone 12 through 21), you’ll get
1/3 off on all domestic flights, on a
standby basis.

Once you get to Europe, TWA’ s
Getaway Program can help you keep
on saving money.

For $1 apiece, you can buy one of
our Getaway Guides to 19 major
cities, and get all kinds of useful tips 1
for eating, sleeping and drinking, as
put together by Arthur Frommer,
the same man who did “Europe on
$5 a Dayi’

If you want to carry as little cash
as possible, you can use our Getaway
Card. With it, you can charge airfare,
hotels, meals and cars and then take
up to two years to pay. When you
show us your TWA ticket, you can also
use the card to cash checks in TWA
ticket offices around the world.

In other words, you’ll get more
value on TWA. In the air and on the
ground.

For reservations, or more
information, call TWA or your travel
agent.
