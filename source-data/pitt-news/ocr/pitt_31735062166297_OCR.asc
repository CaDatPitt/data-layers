ROTC To Select Queen At

Phone Calls Set

- As Final Effort

In Chest Drive

By MURRAY CHASS

Approximately 300 students
are currently working on the
ﬁnal phase of the Pitt Chest
drive. ,

Under the direction of Rich-
ard Mattern, Col. ’59, this

corps of committee members is

V contacting, by telephone, the 4200

students who have not contrib-
uted to the Chest.

Fifteen area leaders. twelve of
them from Druids, are assisting

Mattern in this important task}

These ﬁfteen have 30 students
each working under them, and
these 30, in turn, will call ten of
the 4200 to complete the commit-
tee’s work.
Better Than Even

Chairman Mattern feels that the

Pitt Chest is in a better than even
position to reach and possibly go
over the $3500 goal. _

“The Pitt Che~.t stands a good

chance of meeting and surpassing
‘ its goal for the ﬁrst time in ﬁve
'years if these remaining students
are contacted,” he states.

“This is the ﬁrst time in Pitt
Chest .history that each Pitt
student nas been made aware
of his responsibility to the Pitt
community and‘ world effor .”

If the students who are con-
tacted by telephone wish to con-
tribute, the amount which they
wish to give is expected to be paid
at the Student Desk on the ground

‘University of Pittsburgh
Men’s Debating Association
scored a clean sweep of the
first two places in an interna-
tional debate conferenceat
McGill University, Montreal,

The negative team of Gary

Crombie, Col. ’57; and Sam Reich.
Col. ’57; debating the affirmative
side of the topic: “This house ap-
proves of the principal of athe-
letic scholarships,” ﬁnished in the

«runner-up spot, ahead of 38 other
schools from the United States
and Canada.

Hess and Reid, in upholding
the negative side of the issue,
arguedtheir way through three
rounds and emerged undefeated,
meeting teams from Columbia
University, N.Y.U., and the
University of Cornell. Cornell
recently won the first place
trophy at the Johns Hopkins
Tournament in Baltimore.

Cromie and Reich came through
their three rounds undefeated,
meeting and defeating teams from
Toronto, Bishop’s and Cornell.

Both Pitt teams, each with an
unblemished record, ‘clashed
with each other in a tie-break-
ing debate before an audience
of over two hundred.

Hess and Reid proved too much
for their fellow classmates from
Pitt and managed to edge Reich
and Cromie in the tie-breaker.

Outside Contact

Those who do not receive a
phone call will be contacted out-
side one of their classrooms.

At the end of this campaign as
statistical analysis will be made
to ﬁnd out which methods, either

contact by telephone or contact

outside the classroom, is more
effective. ‘

These 4200 students who have
yet to be contacted represent 69

body. In the ﬁrst part of the

Communications ceded Here

By MILLARD ANIDUR

Dr. Charles Peake, assistant
chancellor for student aﬁairs,
addressed Student Congress
at their meeting Monday,
Feb. 25, in the French Room
of the Student Union. He

prefaced his remarks with 21 ref-
erence to the need for a good sys-
tem of communication in this uni-
versity, just as he found at Michi-
gan and Knox. Very often, a fail-
ure to communicate accounts for
a lack of rapport among various
segments of a university.

For this reason. Peake felt it
necessary both in his previous as-
sociations and here at Pitt, to es-
tablish a “round-table” of stu-
dents to discuss informally and on
a completely candid basis various
university problems. The members
of the round-table will not legis-
late on matters discussed, but will
serve as a liaison between ad-
ministration and student body. In
Pitt’s particular case, it was»de—
cided that the Student Congress
serve as the sounding board or

- round-table. This was the ﬁrst of

a series of sessions with Peake.
First Subject

The ﬁrst subject discussed was
commencement and proposed
changes in procedure. Instead of
three commencement exercises a
year, in the future there will most
likely be only one. The degrees
would still be conferred at ‘the

time of completion of a student’s

studies, but the ceremony would

be held but once. In time, more
and more undergraduates will
complete their course of studies in
June. It will be possible for the
university to have one impressive
ceremony.

Among the changes possible in
such a commencement are the
implementation of a student
.marshal who may lead the pro-
cession of graduates, bearing a
symbol of the institution. He
would in some wayssupercede
the ODK Man of the Year and
would most likely be selected
from the top scholastic ranks.
One representative from each
school may take the place of
the— time-consuming presenta-
tio:* of diplomas to each grad-
uate individually. The gradu-
ates might in the future divide
into small, informalized groups
among members. of a school
after the ceremony proper, in
order that parents may have a
chance to meet and chat with
the graduates’ professors.

Another possible basic change
next year would be a free ﬁfth
hour when no classes (including
ROTC) would be held. This would
give student organizations an op-
portunity to invite distinguished
guests for lunches with a large
proportion of the membership
present. Faculty members too
might have meetings and convo-
cations in the new faculty dining

hall.

 

WSGA

Commission of WSGA meets
tonight on the twelfth ﬂoor ‘af-
ter dinner which begins at 5:30
p.m. The meeting will start at
approximately 6:45 p.m.

Peake Addresses Co11gressMeeting

The new air-conditioned cafe-
teria in the Schenley Hotel (tenta-
tively scheduled to open in the
fall) would providefor the inﬂux
of students eating at the same
time. $150,000 worth of equipment
is being installed in the luxury
eatery and 1500 "students may eas-
ily be served in an hour.

New Attitude

Peake referred to a new atti-
tude which students must take that
they accommodate to university
policy and not vice versa. Peake

-believes that many of the under-

graduates are devoting too much
time to_outside jobs. A student,
Peake believes, should work only
for his subsistence and not for the
luxuries which are desirable but
not necessary. To be a university
student in theotrue sense of the
word, nearly all a student’s time
must be devoted to the university.
More scholarship‘ aid for needy,
worthy students will be available
next year through the central
scholarship service.

Dormitory space will proba-‘
bly open in the fall for 256 in
the Schenley Hotel and for over
a hundred women in one of the
Schenley apartment buildings.
The university, Peake exclaim-
ed, also plans to meet the park-
ing problem headon.

Elections were held to ﬁll eva-
cancies in senior positions on

Congress. Jean O’Donnell, Ed. ’57,
Mark Kartub, Col. ’57, and Larry
Zurowski, Eng. ’58, were elected
representatives.

  More Tlian Friends  

Sororities have welcomed 115 undergraduate women
into their fold. This pledging of ﬁdelity will mark the open-
ing of a new life, social and academic, for the women.

A great many of the beneﬁts which can be derived from g
- the sorority relationship depend on the attitude with which

this new life is received by the pledges. The women have
already enjoyed the beneﬁt of a program of delayed rush-
ing which, it is hoped, the fraternities will eventually adopt.
The coeds have had the time to form a deep understanding

’of sorority in general and a connection with the speciﬁc

group of their choice. ,
That feeling for sorority in general is perhaps the most
important one at this time when all Greek letter societies
are under critical surveillance. It is gn indusputably major
portion of the attitude necessary for a rewarding sorority

Each girl should pledge herself to the advancement of
sorority life at Pitt as well as to the furthering of the ideals

of her speciﬁc group. This pledge is a private and personal '

one and its goal can be expressed in the hundred opportuni-
ties presented every day. The remark not made, the help-
_ing hand at Carnival, and all the things that reflect a Will-
ingness to see that sorority life will be considered the ﬁne
«and rewarding thing that it is. ,

Soon the thrill and glow of rush and pledge parties
will fade and the day-to-day living and working which is
sorority will begin. The laughs and good times will be

, frequent but there will also be times for serious thought

about the future and personal ‘growth. There will be time
All these times will be
shared with a group of women that have been chosen to
act as more than friends. They will help and expect help.
They will show the way and look for the way. ‘
These rewards are there if the attitude is one of giving
as well as receiving. They are rich fruits for the small labor
of being a willing and understanding sister to those who

— have been ,chosen as sisters.

ill/luch has been written, much has been said,‘

about the mass inoculation drive which is start-

the shots in the next four days is spared from«

Big Gool ‘ 

It’s a big goal which Pitt is undertaking; and
it is a goal which will be watched not only by
those in this immediate area, but by people the
world over. People who are skeptical of the idea
of ‘an effective mass-shot idea will have their
skepticism jolted from them if gur pioneering polio
venture is a success.

The students, faculty, employees, and their
families, who receive the shots this week, should
be aware of an immediate goal in the program——-
that of saving their own money by getting the
shots free. But the money that they will “save”-—
about $15 a person for the full three shots-——is of
minor importance when the over-all goal’is con-

Success

sidered. » ~
That long-dreamed of goal can be reached and
it can "be reached soon. This goal, of course, is the
elimination of paralytic polio. Dr. Jonas A. Salk
has stated that this can be done this year “if all—
who are potentially susceptible. are treated with
vaccine that is now available.”
Cases Cut , ,
This statement would have been considered ab-
surd if it was made as early as two years ago, or
even one year ago. For prior to the successful de-
velopment of the Salk Vaccine, there were an aver-
age of 35,251 polio cases a year reported, in the
United States alone. In the ﬁrst full year that the
vaccine was given—-1956-—the number of cases was
cut sharply to about 15,000. g
This is remarkable, cutting the average number
of cases by more than half, but it is even more
remarkable when it is considered that a very min-

ute total of the U. S. population has been vaccinated "

against polio. .

So this all'should be given serious thought
when standing in line for a few short minutes to-
day through Saturday. Some recent words by Dr.
Salk are well worth noting. In a paper presented
in Atlantic City, he said, “. . . responsibility for
the problem of eliminating paralytic poliomyelitis
rests with each individual for whom there is a
need for vaccine, either for himsﬁf or for those
for whom he is responsible; this responsibility is
shared by those who are in a position to bring
this knowledge to him and to help him avail him-
self of the necessary treatment.”

Tuck Shop History

By Genevieve Siconolfi 0’
As everyone’s eyes are now
focused on the glories of the
Hunt Room in the Schenley Ho-
tel, we seem to be forgetting that
our old reliable Tuck Shops also
have a “past.” For the Tuck
Shops weren’t always here.
When the Cathedral «ﬁrst open-
ed, the administration did not
feel that it would be necessary
to provide food service and thus

_ no facilities for eating were in-

stalled. The students had no al-
ternative but to eat at near-by
drug stores.

The students soon realized that
this was impractical, especially
during the winter months. The
result was- that many students
began bringing to schoolcans of
baked beans. When they arrived
in school in the morning, they
would place the cans on radia-
tors. By noon the beans would
be cooked and the. students
would sit under the stairs and
eat their baked beans from the
cans. 9
First Step Token

During the depression the ﬁrst
step was taken toward, providing
food service when a cafeteria
was open in the basement of
what is now the dental school.

It was soon realizedV this
would not be adequate as the
students still wanted food in.the
Cathedral itself. And so a sand-
wich shop was opened on the
eighth floor. This shop remained

Beans In The Basement"

\

open only during lunch time
with no full meals being served,
just sandwiches. A
This sandwich shop was fol-
lowed by a modiﬁed form of the
present tuck shop. Located on
the ground floor where the book
store, is now, it offered a snack
service and was opened all day.
The shop was run on a student

_ activity basis. But still no food

was actually prepared in the

Cathedral as the food was bought
A from outside to be sold. '

Nome Borrowed

Finally on October 28, 1937,
the Blue Tuck Shop, which the
Pitt News of that day referred
to as a “mezanine lounge” where
students “may smoke,” opened.
Since Tech already had its
“Beanery,” Pitt sought a name
that would be both -catchy and
interesting. The name chosen
was Tuck Shop which is deﬁned
as a mart which handles light
lunches, confections and sport-
ing goods. The name was bor-

rowed from Oxford which like

numerous other universities also

‘has tuck shops.

The tuck shop promised to
offer sandwiches, milk, and box
lunches and to begin serving hot
cocoa and soup as soon as pos-
sible. Under the direction of its
hostess and manager, Miss Pris-
cilla Parsons. it remained open
every school day from 9 am. un-
til 4 p.m. The tuck shop was then
sponsored by the Dean of Men

and the Dean of Women.
Another page of tuck shop

history was added in November, »

1939, when water was ﬁrst made
available to the students. The

system was not what it is now,

but instead a pitcher of water
and paper cups were situated on
a stand near the cashier. ‘When
you paid the cashier for your
food, you were permitted to take
a cup and fill it with water from
the pitcher. 
The tuck shop has grown con-
siderably in size since its open-
ing. Originally it had only one
line and one entrance. Gradually
it expanded until it is now 60%
larger than originally planned.
A few years after the opening
of the Blue Tuck Shop,'it was
felt that this shop was not suffi-
cient to serve the students and so
on March 27, 1940, the Red Tuck
Shop opened. Naturally, it was
called the Red Tuck Shop since
its walls were painted red. That
day’s Pitt News dubbed the shop
as the “Kathedral Kitchonett,”
and said that it had three main

rules —— “no hats, no beer, and r"”

ten-cent sodas.” The Red Tuck
then remained open every day
from 8 a.m. until 5 pm. Later
its hours were reduced to what
they are at present. A

And so, even though the Hunt
Room may have had a» more
glamorous past, nevertheless the
tuck shops do have their own
interesting history.

Letters to the Editor  

Editor, The Pitt. News:

In reply to the dissatisfaction
with Pitt as expressed by a very
large number 0 fstudents and to
the specific complaints of Mrs.

Jay Butler, I would like to make .

these observations. ‘

Most of the vague, general dis-
satisfaction stems, I believe, from
a pre-conceived romanticized
visualization of college in its so-
cial, its cultural, and its intellec-
tual aspects. With the extreme di-
versity of interests which any
university must have, particular-
ly a large urban one, it is totally
unreasonable to expect an ab-
stract feeling of culture or any
deﬁnite atmosphere to be felt by
the unviersity system including
the constituent students. The en-
gineers come to learn engineer-
ing and the liberal arts majors
to study Arthur Miller and Bach.
It is the function of the individ-

ual, not ‘of the university to de-
cide wherein one’s interests and
propensities .lie. If the engineer
like Miller or Sartre, Bach or
Aristotle, the material is at his
disposad; if he has no interest in
such things, it is no more the
fault of the University then it is
of the student’s parents or his
grammar school.

In opposition to the popular
theory that the college student
should be spoon-fed on knowl-
edge,‘ and the individual given
personal and almost tutorial in-
struction, I propose that the stu-
dent of even the largest and most
impersonal classes, the “statisti-
cal entity,” can get precisely
what he wishes to get from Pitt.
Of course a premise must be
that the student has some deﬁn-
ite end in mind. If he has, he
picks out the best men in his de-
partment and takes as many

courses from the mas possible. ~-

He suppliments his study b yas
much outside reading as is possi-
ble. He drifts toward other stu-
dents o fhis own inclinations. But
most of all he does not acknowl-
edge the existence of that ab-
stract entity, The University, and
he does not expect anything in
the way of spiritual enlighten-
ment from it. He works indepen-
dently of the system, drawing
from within himself his needs,
his goal, and the energy to meet
them.

The answer to ‘those who man-
ifest dissatisfaction with Pitt
then is that they would most
likely have the same feelings‘ at
any school they attended; the
dissatisfaction has its basis in
their own uncertainty and a kin
of personal discontent. ‘

Tonight’s contest against Wheel-

The ﬁrst contest was lopsided
and tonight’s promises to be no
different if the initial game can
be used as a measuring stick.

Saturday’s game with the Nit-

different story. The Lions are a
good, well-balanced team and
should give the Panthers plenty of

‘Off Year’ Mermen End

Season Against Miami

’ By MURRAY CHASS

The“longest” season that Coach Ben Grady has experi-
enced since he took over the head coaching job of the Panther
swimmers 18 years ago willcome to a close this Saturday
at the PAA pool, 8 p.m., when the local mermen take on

the Miami (Ohio) Redskins.

Although the Panthers have the
Eastern championships to worry
about, the contest with Miami will
be their final dual meet.

The season has been a long
one .in that Grady’s tankershave
captured only one meet this far.
Grady laments, “This is the ﬁrst
time I’ve gone through a season
with just one win. It seems like
an off year for us.”

Once again Grady says that the
lack of good men for second and
third places has been a big draw-
back this year. For instance, last
year the locals had Warne White,
then a junior, to take' either a
second or third in the 220- and
440—yard freestyles, behind Jim
Zurcher, a sure winner. This sea-

spot, but Grady found no one who
could back up the Panther captain.

Four senior swimmers will be
in their last dual meet Saturday.
White, Bernie Bauer, Ben Sklar,
and Burt Marks will bid farewell
to the PAA pool against Miami.

As things look now, the Red-

skins should have no trouble
from the weaker local squad. In
a show of strength the visitors
are bringing a team of 17 swim-
mers to meet the Blue and Gold,
whereas the hosts can only boast
of ten.

Redskins who were victors in
last year’s Panther win and who
are back again are John Hum-
phries—-a freestyler, Dennis O’-
Brien-—butterﬂyer,s and Bob Ham-
er--a diver.

Panthers After 27th Straight

Matmen Host State In Big One

By CHRIS ‘

GILLOTTI

A continuation of a great rivalry; an opportunity to
complete another unbeaten season; and a chance to defeat

some of the best wrestlers in

the East will all be available

to the Panther matmen this Saturday asvthey tackle Penn
State at the Field House starting at 9 p.m. _
The Peerymen, out to chalk up their second s_uccessive

all-winning season, will be aftei¢_

their tenth victory of the year and
27th straight.

The Nittany Lions, on the other
hand, will be out to improve on
a comparatively poor season by
dumping the Panthers. State was
upset by Lehigh, 16-13, and Navy,
14-13, and: tied by Cornell, 12-12,
while winning ﬁve other meets.

Little Men Tough

Credit for the wins State does
have should go to their little men.
Sid Nodland, 123 pounds, and
Johnny Johnston, 130 pounds, are
both Eastern champs and are un-
defeated this year.

John Pepe (137), who , ranked
third in the NCAA ﬁnals last year,

has lost only one match, and Dave

Adams (147), second ranked in
his division in the NCAA, has
only two ties to blemish his rec-
ord.

To combat this quartet Coach

Rex Peery will throw in ‘his cham-
pionship trio of Bill Hulings (123),
Ed Peery (130), and Vic DeFe1ice
(137). Bob Bubb and Ted Bien-
kowski will go at 147 and 157 al-
though Peery is not sure which
one*will wrestle at which weight.
Speidel Optimistic

The same situation is present in
the next two classes. At 167 it
will. be between Dave Johnson
and Bob Richardson. Johnson and
Tom Alberts are the candidates at
177 pounds. Ron Schirf will prob-
ably have to continue his yeoman-
like chores in the heavyweight
class to remain undefeated.

Although Peery is quick to ad-
mit that it will be one of the
toughest matches of the season,
"Penn State mentor Charlie Speidel
is of a different frame of mind.

Following the lead of Duquesne’s
Dudey Moore, Coach Speidel be-

moaned the condition of his squad
and tried to give the impression
that the ﬁve wins his Lions did
gain were lucky upsets.

Speidel promises a good show
nevertheless. “In spite of what
happens we’ll show up,” he stated,
“and we’re not coming down there
to lie down. It will be a battle
between every man.”

Thinclads To Compete

In 104.4 ’s so tu rda y

By JOHN FAYI
At New York this Saturday the Panther thinclads will
face the nation’s foremost trackstars in the IC4lA meet.
Coach CarlAOlsoni doesn’t anticipate any ﬁrst place ﬁnishes,
but there is hope that every local entrant will at least place.

Going to the mark in the

209.4, and with a fast start, he

in the 60-yard
event despite the competition from
Dave Sime and other top stars.

Paul Thrash, the locals’ un-
derrated hurdler, may. surprise
many dbservers when he com-
petes in the 60-yard high hur-
dles. Thrash has always fared
well in the hurdles and the 440-
yard run. The Panther thinclad
is expected to run a leg of the
mile relay, too. ‘

Leading the Blue and Gold in
the two-mile relay will be anchor
man Perry Jones. Running in the
shadow of the great Arnie Sowell
last year, Jones showed that he
was an excellent middle-distance
man by winning or placing second
to his running mate over the half-
mile route in several meets. C

Other men returning from last

60-yard sprint will be.Herb

Carper, returning ace from last year’s squad. In the 100 yard
dash, Carper has-been clocked inO~—-—

year’s_ two-mile relay team, which
was one of the top relay teams in
the country, are Jim Moore and

Wendell Harford. Rounding out
the team is Sam Grisciotti, a good
prospect up from last year’s frosh
boardmen.

Coach Olson is undecided as
to who will run in the mile
relay since he has ﬁve good men
available. Ed Saunders, Dick
Doyle, Thrash, and Charles Hef-
lin are back from last year’s
squad, and frosh sensation Jay
Moody is ready to ﬁll a’ position
also.

Dbspite the fact that he is ‘only
a sophomore, Vince Timon should

prove to be one of the best dis-

tance men in this part of the coun.
try. Coach Olson expects Timon to
ﬁnish in one of the top three spot:

MY FAIR OXFORD

Scene: The London drawing
room of Professor M oriarity
Kitchener, philologist and elocn-
tzonzst. As curtain rises, Kit-
chener is singing and dancing.

. Kitchener: Why can’t the Eng-
lish learn how to speak? Hey?

Why can’t a woman be like a
man? What? Why can’t any-
body grow accustomed to my

_ face? So?

Enter Gatsby‘ Donothing, a
chimney sweep.

Donothing: P’arn me, Perﬁ-
zer K, oi w’d loik tao lorn ’ow

Kitchener: Ugh! (Aside) Yet,
he s a challenge. (To Donoth;
zng) All right, loathsome, in
SD‘ Weeks. Y011’ll be speaking
well enough to go to the Coro-
nation Ball!

Seventeen commercial and military models of aircraft are in
production at _Lockheed.
Development projects are even more diversiﬁed, include

jet and propjet transports, ﬁghters and bombers far exceeding
prescnt—day planes in performance, radar search planes,
nuclear applications to aircraft and a number of signiﬁcant
classiﬁed activities.
This capacity to develop and produce such a wide range of
aircraft is important to career-conscious engineers. It means
more scope for your ability, more opportunity for promotion 
with so many projects in motion. It means more security -
because your career is not restricted to one type of plane. A,

Kitchener: Oh, my Aunt Sally,
the blighter hasn’t learned a
thing. I_’m lost. But wait. I’ll
dress him in a Van Heusen
Oxford cloth shirt. Then he’ll
pass as a gentleman for sure!
All I have to do is be sure he
keeps his big mouth shut. I'm
saved, but good!

Yes, friends, there's nothing
like Van Heusen Oxford cloth
shirts to make a gentleman of
you. Whether you prefer but-
