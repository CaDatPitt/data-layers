Ibis Seats

  Limited for

Production

Tickets for the University The-

atre's production of Mistress of .

the Inn are selling so rapidly
that more stringent seating reg-
ulations are being enforced at
the IBIS Theatre where the 18th
century Italian comedy premieres
tomorrow, Friday, Saturday and
Monday evenings._

Dr. William H. Kingsley, busi-
ness manager for the University
Theatre, explained, “Even if tick-,
ets are bought and paid for, we
cannot hold the seats they rep-
resent indeﬁnitely and deny
standees a spot from which they
may view the show. Therefore,
all seats unoccupied by curtain
time will be thrown open to the
general public whether they ‘are
reserved or not.”

Because the IBIS allows a lim-
ited seating of only 72 people, it
will present two shows per eve-
ning at 7:30 and 9:30 p.m. and a
Saturday matinee at -2 p.m.

Admission is 75 cents-for mem-
bers of the staff and faculty.
Tickets are available at the Stu-
dent Desk in the Cathedral, Stu-
dent Union and Towers.

Debate Union to Hold 1

Cross Exam Contest   .

The William Pitt Debating Union will hold its eigh-
teenth annual Cross Examination tournament this Friday ‘
and Saturday. Schools from 15 states and Canada are en-

tered.

The tournament willconsist of six rounds of ‘debate on ,
the topic resolved; That Law Enforcement Agencies Should
Be Given Greater Freedom in the

Investigation and Prosecution of
Crime. A ﬁnal round will be de-
bated between the two top
schools at the tournament while
ﬁnal tabulation ‘of the results is
completed. '

The winning four-place team
will receive the Aluminum Com-
pany of America trophy, won
last year by the University of
Alabama. The top two-speaker
aﬁirmative team will be awarded
the Gulf Oil Corporation Tro-
phy, while the top negative team
will be given the Jones and
Laughlin Trophy.

An unusual feature of the tour-
nament will be the awarding of
a trophy to the best judge, as de-
cided by the ballots of the de-
baters. Their decision will be
based on the Judge’s critiques,
which are given at the end of
each round at William Pitt tour-
naments. This trophy, furnished
by the Rust Engineering Corn-
pany, was won last year by Pro-
fessor Richard Huseman from the
University of Georgia.

' Thomas Kane, associate direc-
tor of the Union, will be in
charge of the tournament. Each
round will j consist of 40 debates;
beginning Friday at 4:30 and 5:45,

Advisers Explain 
Liberal Arts QPA 

The cumulative Quality Point Average (QPA) appeal‘-,' 
ing on your trimester grade report is not your official QPA. ‘
“The green grade sheets are not used as official by the?
School of LiberalArts,” said Miss Joyce Anderson, admin
istrative assistant in the, advising center. “We do not us 
them or quote them. They are not official.” ’ ‘ ‘

Miss Anderson explained mat
the University has two types of
QPA for each‘ student. The type
appearing on each trimester’s
green grade report is called the
probation QPA. It includes any
course a student has taken at the
University, including all levels of
any language.

“The green grade reports in-
clude everything,” said Miss An-
derson. “G grades, repeated
courses, languages, and anything
else are on those reports.”

The probation QPA is used for
determining when a student goes
on probation and when ﬁnancial
aid is considered by the Office of
Student Aid. “We. use the QPA
furnished by the Office of Stu-
dent Records,” said Miss Marian
Bonney, head of the student aid
department. It is the same QPA
as appears on grade reports.

Graduation QPA is the other
type recorded for each student. It
includes “only University courses
that apply to a student’s degree,”
said Miss Anderson. “It does not
include language courses on the

elementary level (language one
and two).”

Miss -Anderson said the advis,-S

VVednesday, December 1, 1965.

mg center has been receiving‘:

numerous requests to clarify théf
relation ‘between a student’s, QPA,
and his language requirement. ‘
“The Liberal Arts Catalog‘ ex
plains the language requiremen
she said, “but it does not‘
tinguish the two types of QP
The student handbook makes tli
distinction.” , -
Currently, “the School of7Li
eral Arts normally accepts onl
the credits earned at the Inte
mediate level of any languag
(except Chinese or Russian wheir
both elementary and interm
ate credits may count) among
minimum of the 124 required
a degree,” according to the‘
Catalog. ‘
Students can count ' a ma
mum of 12 credits toward gra
nation from his credits earned C’
the language and English
and two. “A student canfg’
credit for a second language
elective credits,” said lV_Ii
derson. "Under no-circuzn _
will we give elective credits.‘
a language unless a person 
both language ’ levels —onei’>'
two.” - V 

Revamped SG Constitution
Presented by Senate Group _

The proposed Student Gov-
ernment (SG) Constitution,
presented by three senators
at the last meeting, revamps
the entire structure of SG.

/Under it, SG’ would be com-

posed‘ of a President’s Council, a
University Appeals ‘Board, and a
General Assembly in addition to
the existing‘ Executive and Sen-
ate.- Senators Charles Hollander,
John Ruskay, and Dyanne Hoch-
man drafted it.

The President’s Council will
consist- of the president and vice-
president of SG and the presi-
dents of 11 major organizations.
These organizations are: Men's
Dorm Council, Associated Wom-
en Students, Women’s Housing
Board, Men’s Council, Interfrater-
nity Council, Pan-Hellenic Coun-
cil, Basic Student Nurse’s' Asso-
ciation, Engineering and «Mines
Cabinet. Also included are editor-
in-chief of The Pitt News, gen-
eral manager of WPGI-I, and
chairman of the Student Union
Board.

The Council will meet at least
once between senate meetings to
“discuss major issue at the Uni-
versity, and make suitable rec-

ommendations to the senate and/

or any other branch of Student
Government.” The presidents will
have permission to speak at sen-
ate meetings but will have no
vote. '

Editorial. Your QPA
- The revelation about the University’s two types of quality point
averages (QPA’s) (see story, page 1) may seem like a trivial matter. It

__ At first glance, the explanation appears clear, concise, and accurate.
I here are two QPA’s; one goes on the permanent record, the other on the
trimester grade report. One is official, the other is mainly a convenience
for the student——so he’ll have some idea of his QPA.

A A deeper look reveals several weak points in the liberal arts system
5(/LA) in general, and the advising center in particular.
The two QPA set-up (graduation and probation QPA’s) is a Uni-
’ ersity policy, and has been for at least three years. Yet, it does not appear
in‘; the liberal arts catalog. It appears in the infrequently used student

Student are somewhat at fault for not reading the handbook and
becoming familiar with such policies, but the liberal arts catalog should
also contain a clearer account of the QPA requirements, the distinction
“between the two types, and their relation to courses, especially languages. .
)’ Miss Anderson’s account of the "QPA system gives /an adequate
explanation, clarifying many questionswith which students are confronted.
}The trimester system, the 124 required credits for a degree, and the dis-
?t1-‘ibution concept are puzzling to most freshmen and even some upperclass-
inen. Students should not have to search out a basic policy; it should be

is particularly moving to see him
talking with youngsters and teen-
agers. Belong to a hurried gen-
eration where beauty is too often
by-passed for utility, they wear
almost “awed” expressions on
their faces as they listen to this
man rever/ently communicate

‘ something of the spirit of a past

age which had the patience and
devotion to produce such intri-
cate beauty.

It is on an occasion such as
this that we wish’the University
were"able to show its high es-
teem by awarding honorary doc-
torates to such men. (Columbia
University on its 200th anniver-
sary awarded several such de-
grees to ﬂower, peanut and news-
paper vendors who had provided
kind, thoughtful service to the
university population.) We could
think of no ﬁner man for such an
honor than Mr. Sciulli.

In conclusion, we would like to
say to Mr. Sciulli, “Well done,”
“many thanks," and “many hap-
py days ahead.”

. I I
- - A Policy Revealed
Miss Anderson, recognizes the failure in the catalog, but she said
all advisers were told about the distinction in their orientation. Unfor-
tunately most advisers either did not understand the distinction or merely
felt it was unnecessary information for students.
Students are constantly unclear about the requirements and neither
the LA catalog nor advisers have been able to fully explain the issue. Per-
haps now it will be put in writing in the appropriate catalog, students may
open their tired eyes to read before complaining, and advisers may explain.
Another alternative would be to change the system. Unfortunately,
the computers make it imperative to have the two QPA’s. Once a set of ‘
grade cards are punched and recorded on the grade report, changesin
grades, elimination of G grades, and removal of the elementary language
grades cannot be recorded.

 

 

I

The grade report QPA represents inevitable computarized innaccur-

acy, but it is not official. What could be changed, and what isnow official
is the language requirement. .

If language is going to be required and there is no QPA credit given
for the elementary levels, why not give merely a pass or fail mark. The
assigning of an A to F mark is unnecessary. It adds further inaccuracy to
the grade report QPA and is not ‘calculated in the official QPA.

There are always complaints about advising and counseling. Some
are valid, others are not. On the matter of the two QPA’s and the language
requirement serious examination is required. Perhaps one of the many

groups evaluating the LA program will consider the merits of such issues.

Letters To The Editor

Hawthorne House
Reports Saga Bugs ,

Editor, The Pitt, News:

It is not that we wish to be-
come complete herbivores, but
when we are going to be served
meat in the cafeteria, we would
like to know beforehand what it
will be. For the second time in
less than a month, _Hawthorne
House members have found bugs
in the salad.

This would not .be bad if the

dinner mbnu announced Lady,

Bug Special or Tse Tse Fly Cass-
erole, but the introduction of in-
sects into the food has not been
listed leaving one to consider
the possibility that they were
thrown in as an afterthought.

If this is the case, then I
would recommend that Saga Food,
Inc. conduct another survey to
determine just how many meal
ticket-holding students want bugs
in their salad. 1, for one, do not
care for them; I would prefer to
get my meat nutrients from
heftier specimens
steak, ﬁsh, etc. And I suspect
that thereeare many who share
my feelings in this respect.

If, instead, the insects are pre-
sent only because the items in
the salad were not washed, then

the solution is obvious. The salad -

should and must be washed to
protect the health of the students.
If this is not done, then we can
only wonder about other por-
tions of the meal, such as the
meat; i.e. what is the gravy hid-
ing?

Perhaps it is too extreme ‘to ,

compare Saga Food preparation‘

chicken, A

with that in Upton Sinclair’s The ~

Jungle. Perhaps it is superﬂuous

I to mention that the Board of-
‘ Health would take a keen inter-

est in “the Saga Salad Bugaboo
combinations.

But it is imperative that the
situation be corrected. In the‘
gastronomical bible there is an
old and familiar _manix: “Don’t
bug us, man!” If you think this
letter is in poor taste, try a
Saga salad.

Republican Reviews

Democrat Column
Editor, The Pitt News:

Today I read the column “Po-
litical Initiation” by Linda Gold-
stein in the Nov. 17 Pitt News and
I feel obliged to reply in the
strongest terms. It is not often
that one reads a column as asi-
nine as that one Was.

Since I am, like Miss Gold-
stein, a political science major,
I ‘ﬁnd it particularly hard to un-
derstand how anyone can main-
tain, as she does, that one party
is wholly good and the other
wholly bad. This is ridiculous in
the extreme.

If Miss Goldstein likes to dream
of herself as an innocent, lily-
white Democrat duped into at-
tending a foul, evil Republican,
dinner, that is her prerogative,
but in trying to palm off such
childish drivel on serious stu-

dents she goes too far. -

Regarding her hero, John ' F.
Kennedy, he was a ﬁne man, but
his accomplishments, or lack of
them, as President consign him

to the limbo of the mediocre.
I can, however, understand her
feelings about Sen. Goldwater.
He entertained some_ ridiculous
notion about bombing North
Vietnam and actually sending
American troops into the battle.
Who \ but a wild-eyed radical
would i ever consider such an

‘idea? Certainly not that shining

example of honesty and forth-
rightness, Lyndon Johnson.

As a student of politics and a
conservative Republican, I have
found much to admire and much
to deplore in both parties, but

any right-"thinking, informed per-

son must conclude that both par-
ties have only the good of our
country in mind, however much
their methods and beliefs may
clash. , ‘
Miss iGoldstein’s implication
that the Democrats are all right
and the Republicans all Wrong
is ludicrous, absurd, and’ an in-
sult to the intelligence of any-
one who it not totally apolitical.
-It passes belief that any seri-
ous student of political science
could commit himself to. such an
insane position.
Whether or not Miss Goldstein
believes it, those Young Ameri-

cans for Freedom she was sent

to observe have a ‘right to" their
opinion just as the Americans for
Democratic Action have a right

to theirs. The tone of her column

would lead one to the opposite
conclusion. ,

In closing I must say that if _

Miss Goldstein would emulate
John Kennedy, she must first cul-
tivate a respect for someone
else’s opinion, whether or not she
agrees with it. That seems to'be
one ideal she missed entirely.

Difference in Views I

Of Culture Discussed
Editor, The Pitt News:

I would like to intervene in
the discussion about the so called
“cultural superiority” of the Eur-
opean college student, since it
appears to me that the real prob-
lem has been completely misun-
derstood.

I hawe studied in an American
and in an Italian high school,
and I am doing graduate work at
 Pitt, after studying in Italian and

French universities. Everywhere
I have found students ‘of all
kinds, and I do not think that
anyone can honestly make “em-
pirical generalizations about the
“cultural level” of «European and
American students.

We should ﬁrst deﬁne “cul-
ture” and then avoid falling into
the usual trap of-opposing “sci-

Kg; entiﬁc culture”. to “humanistic
culture.” We should also use real
statistical data (and not make up
data) to identify the “popula-
'tion” of our discussion, and take
into account the differences in
social origin among students and

in goals betwen school systems, .

and therefore we should be very
careful in making statements

_ which are not supported by evi-
*3;-adence or comparisons between
’ things with different objectives.
This “preface” was simply in-
tended to remind that appear-
ances are often misleading, and
that making superﬁcial compari-
sons is not what is expected by
college students of any country.
There is one aspect of the prob-

’lem, however, that I feel can be
used to draw a main line, or to
suggest a main difference. This

" aspect is the “attitude” toward
“‘“*this undeﬁned experience which
we call culture. Inthe U.S. cul-

Letters To The Editor

ture appears to me as a product
for mass consumpton, while in
Europe it is more like a state of
being.

Once again, I am able to find
contradictory examples in both
countries, and I want to point
out that I am discussing a very
thin feeling, a shade in attitudes
rather than a substantial differ-
ence. However, I believe that the
attitude toward culture is the
basic element that can distin-
guish ‘an European student from
an American one.

In Europe, everything around
one is history, art, tradition, and
class distinctions casted for ages.
Without even realizing that, the
young European is brought up to
breath the soul of the past, and
to live with culture as with the
most natural thing of all. He can-
not help having under his ‘eyes
the examples,of people who feel
the tradition of the past as he
does, and he cannot help loving
the things which generations of
Europeans have loved, or at least,
been taught to love. —

Besides, the idea of culture has

always been associated with the
higher classes, and the natural
desire to climb the “social lad-
der” has always been associated
with a deeper interest (and sin-
cere love) for culture. We go to
college to get a specialization,
not an “education” as in the U.S.,
since it is assumed a priori that
culture cannot be taught, and
that it will ﬂow into us from the
first day of life.

In the United States you can
even find more “culture” than
in Eu.rope—if you define it in a
certain way, and then quanify it
-——but the attitude is that of “tak-
ing a course in it” rather than
letting culture ﬂow spontaneously
into you. By pure study it is pos-
sible to know much more about
cuture, but still it will not be the
kind of culture that permeates
your life, your goals, your raison
d’etre. As Professor Rose said
once, the difference is" between
“owning” a painting of which
you know all‘ the particulars, and
“having it inside yourself.” The
difference is between owning
something externally or internal-

ly, between mastering a know-
ledge or making it become part
of you.

Centuries’ of traditions, and
more generically embeddied so-
ciological reasons handed down
from the past account for differ-
ences in attitude which cannot
be changed in a few years, no
matter what changes in the edu-
cational system take place. It is
like wearing a dinner jacket: you

I Wednesday, December 1, H1965 —- rm-2? irirrliivnws - Pages  

may wear the shiniest one, but
you are comfortable and “nat-
ural” in it only if you and the
society where you come from
considers it natural, proper,“ and
even obvious that you should
wear it, as your forefathers did.

A good tailor‘ is never enough,
not to say of a clothes section of
a department store.

THE BLUEBIRD OF HAPPINESS
HAS FLOWN THE COOP

Can education bring happiness?
This is a question that in recent years has caused much

lively debate and several hundred stabbings among Ameri- ,

can college professors. Some contend that if a student's in-
tellect is sufficiently‘ aroused, happiness will automatically

’ follow. Others say that to concentrate on the intellect and

ignore the rest of the personality can only lead to misery.

I myself favor the second view, and I offer in evidence
the well-known case of Knut Fusco. . ‘ .

Knut, a forestry major, never got anything less than a.
straight “A,” was awarded his B.T.‘ (Bachelor of Trees) in
only_two years, his M.S.B. (Master of Sap and Bark) in
only three, and his D.B.C. (Doctor of Blight and Cutworms)
in only four.

Academic glory was his. His intellect was the envy of

every intellectfan on campus. But was he happy? The an- ‘
swer, alas, was no. Knut—he knew not why—was miser- .

able; so miserable, in fact, that one day while walking _
across campus, he was suddenly so overcome with melan-
chbly that he ﬂung himself, weeping, upon the statue of. the
Founder. . '
By and by, a liberal arts coednamed Nikki Sigafoos came
by with her Barby doll. She noted Knut’s condition. “How
come you're so unhappy, hey?” said Nikki. '
“Suppose you tell me, you dumb old liberal arts major,”
replied Knut peevishly. ’ “

“All right, I will,” said Nikki. “You are unhappy for two . --

reasons. First, because you have been so busy stuﬂing your
intellect that- you have gone and starved your psyche. ’
I’ve got nothing . ,
against learning, ,
mind you, but a per-
son oughtn’t to ne-
glect the pleasant.
‘gentle amenities of
life—the fun things.
Have you, for in-
stance, ever been,to
a dance?”
Knut shook his
head. _  ______ _ _   
“Have you ever u - - ’ n 
watched a Sunset? . . . and then to a justice of the peace. ,
Written a poem? Shaved with a Personna Stainless Steel 1
Blade?” ' S Q
Knut shook his head.

     

.4-w.—.

“We1l, we’ll ﬁx that right now,7’ said Nikki, and gave him * B
a razor, a Personna Stainless Steel Blade, and a can of » v

Burma. Shave. * I
Knut lathered with the Burma Shave and shaved with ’.

_ the Personna and for the ﬁrst time in many long years he ‘

smiled. He smiled and then he laughed—-peal after peal of [ .

, reverberating, joy. “Wow-dow!” he cried. “What a sha_ve!_ ‘
1 Does Personha come in injector style, too?” . ‘ ‘

\.

“It does,” said Nikki.

“Gloriosky!” cried Knut. “And doesBurma Shave come ~ -~

in menthol, too?” , '
“It does,” said Nikki. .
“Huzzah!” cried Knut. “Now that I have found Personna

and Burma Shave I will never have another unhappy day.” [ . A

“Hold!" said Nikki. “Personna and Burma Shave‘ alone
will not solve your problem—only half of it. Remember I
said there were two things making you unhappy?”

“Oh, yeah,” said Knut. “What’s the other one?”-

“Howlong have you had that bear trap on your foot?” W

said Nikki.

“I stepped on it during ﬁeld trip in my freshman year,”_ » ’

said Knut. “I keep meaning to have it taken off.”
“Allow me,” said Nikki and removed it.

-“Land’s sakes, what a relief!” said Knut, now totally.
happy, and took Nikki's hand and led her to a Personna
vendor and then to a justice of the peace. .

_‘ Today Knut is a perfectly fulﬁlled man, both intellect-
wise and personalitywise. He lives in a charming split-level "
house with Nikki and their 17 children and he rises steadily
in the forestry game. Only last month, in fact, he became
Consultant on Sawdust to the American Butchers Guild,
he was named an Honorary Sequoia by. the park commis-
sioner of Las Vegas, and he published a best—selling book '
called I Was a Slippery Elm for the FBI.

By FRANK SMIZIK, Sports Editor
Who is really the bad egg in the University
of Pittsburgh football program? Was John
Michelosen the sacrificial lamb? According to
_some of the cities’ newspaper men and sports

commentators, Frank Carver plucked the wrong‘

egg from‘the basket when he recommended to
the Athletic Committee of the the Board of Trustees to
replace John Michelosen as head coach.

' Michelosen has a hazardous profession. The coach
takes all the credit or all the blame. Even though he

is ' has been eulogised by the local press as a gentlemen, a

ﬁne individual, a god football coach, and victim of
circumstances; he still had to go.

The coffin lid was clamped tight, when in view
of 57,000 people the Panther football team and Michelo-
sen were buried. Carver decided then, that a change
was necessary. He must have thought as everyone else

71' did, was any team 50 points better than Pitt?

He talked to Michelosen on the plane back from
California. Even before the Penn State game, Michelosen

 ‘knew he was through. Last Wednesday, a press confer-

ence was held and acting Chancellor Stanton Craw-

ford announced that Michelosen was welcome to stay

on at the University, but in a position other than foot-
’ ball coach.

Was Carver -shifting the blame to the wrong per-
‘§on_”.on1y partially. -Michelosen was not ﬁred because
he was the coach of a team which lost to many 101)-Sided
games, or because he was the only scapegoat available.
He was ﬁred because he wasn’t doing the job.

His teams had won only six of their last 20 games,
and the 16 incoming freshmen didn’t offer much en-

T . _couragement. Dynamism was needed in the football pro-

gram, and mild-mannered, even tempered, nice guy
Michelosen was not the man. ,
Pitt football has not changed overnight because of

~Michelosen’s dismissal, nor will it. What Panther fans, “

alumni, and most important Frank Carver want to see
is this University at the top in football again.

Carver is not free from guilt when we assess the
Panther’s football problems. He has refused to condone
red-shirting and he has continued to plan difficult sched-
ules. He also doesn’t plan to make any proposals to the
Board of Trustees to lower admission standards for
athletes. ’

If Carver is being unrealistic he doesn’t think so.
He had the, names of 46 boys who were admitted to Pitt
this fall. Thirty of these ballplayers decided this Univer-

sity wasn’t the school for them. Out of these 46 players, A

we should be able to ﬁll our quota of 25 football schol-
arships. I don’t think Carver is being unrealistic.

There is only one problem. If we are playing schools
who have double standards for athletes why shouldn’t
we do the same things. There have been cases where
students have been accepted at schools that the Pan-
thers have on their schedule, but these same. boys could
not pass the entrance requirements here. This is not
playing the teams on equal terms, and is one. of the
handicaps Michelosen worked under while recruiting.

The impasse for all recruiters seems to be the for-
eign language requirement. If Princeton or Michigan
doesn’t require their athletes to take a language why
should the athletes at Pitt have to take two years worth-
This, however, is up to the Board of Trustees and not
the Athletic Director.

If Carver is the bad egg in the University’s football
plight it is only because he has scruples. He is one of
the few Athletic Directors who recognizes the value of
an education over proweress on the gridiron.

I agree with his principles, and on the basis of the
ﬁgures he has shown, it is possible to recruit enough
“scholar” athletes to make our football program a suc-
cessful one.

The next problem that Carver faces is the hiring
of a new coach. When he ﬁrst started looking for a new

i coach. It will have to be someone who has an inside track

 

Season’s Close Ends Panther Agony

’ 31

By TOM SACKS

Except for those teams
 . preping for appearances in
' ‘ the upcoming holiday bowl
_, games, the collegiate football
season has finally drawn to
4 a close. Those in the years to
come who will be looking back at
the 1965 Panthers can be sure to
ﬁnd the most accurate reports on
’_the obiturary page. ’

Fortunately for the Panthers
f not that many will want to recall
‘the past season. And for those
. few that do once will be enough.

The 3-7 record was one of the
worst in the grid history book.
0 . The defensive unit set a new
;, scoring mark, which is not likely
. to be broken for a long time to
 _j .come. There’s rumors that Bob
V  Dylan is dedicating his new song
  to the Rahads. The title—“How
4 ' Many Miles?”

7  Many will attempt to point to
'*I*'“"'.{the rough schedule as one of the
‘ ‘reasons for the Panthers demise.
A" closer look, however, shows

_that the schedule was not as
" tough as it was made up to be.
_‘Only Notre Dame and South-
ern California lived up to ex-
‘~"'- pectations. And even the Irish
were held to minus 12 yards
rushing against "Michigan State,
Oregon finished in the cellar in
the Paciﬁc Coast league. Okla-
homa didn’t do much better in
the Big Eight.

1 West Virginia at one point lost
‘four straight games. Navy barely
managed to break even. Penn
State had its worst season in 27
years.

 The Panthers were one of the
few brightspots on Notre Dame-’s
ischedule. Notre Dame was shoot-
ing for the moon in their 69-13
"victory. There wasn’t much more
‘thancheese barring their way. If
the Irish hadn't taken their ﬁrst
_, team out so early, Frank Carver
vi’ gmijght have had another worry
added to the long list now before
shim.-_-a scoreboard adapted for
recording over 100 points.

‘ably won't be equaled in the up-
" ‘basketball season. South-

    
 
    
  
  
   
  
   
    
   
   
   
    
   
 
  
  
  
   
 
  
    
  
  
 
   
 
  
 
 
  
    
  
  
    
 
  

    
   
  
  
 
   
   
    
 

ern California’s Mike -Garrett
broke Ollie Matson’s a1l—time
rushing record this year and the

‘Panthers gave him a big boost

along the way.

Before the season began every-
one pointed to Kenny Lucas as
the key to possibie success. Lu-
cas rewrote the record books
with his arm, turning out to be
much better than anyone expect-
ed. It was the supposedly strong

running game which fell ﬁat.
Barry McKinght waited nine
games before gaining back his
running form. '

Even the dramatic 30-27 win
over Penn State ended on a note
in harmony with the rest of the
season. The winning margin
came on a ﬁeld goal by Frank
Clark. It was the first three-point
er of the season and may be
Clark’s last. «

list. Now, there are about 15. Several coaches that Car-
ver hadn't considered have applied for the job, and a
decision shouldbe forthcoming by the end of the week.
Twoiof the coaches that Carver was considering, Bud
Wilkinson and Vic Fusia, withdrew their names from the
list.

Wilkinson said that he was perfectly satisﬁed with
his present job. Fusia, who has the royal treatment
given to him at Massachusetts, was quite emphatic
about not coming here.

He said that the job offered no security. With the 7
way he is treated at Massachusetts, he would feel inse- 3‘
cure if he was appointed to the supreme court. They
are in the midst of a football rejuvenating program at
Massachusetts, and he is part of it.

Bo Schembechler, head coach of Miami of Ohio, also
dropped his name from consideration on Monday. He
stated that he felt a certain allegiance to Miami, and
didn’t wish to leave. Carver had been extremely im-
pressed with Schembechler’s credentials. _

One member of the present Panther coaching staff,
Bimbo Cecconi, has applied. He is one of Carver’s fav-
orite football players and may have a good shot at the
job.

One/name that hasn’t been mentioned by the news- 
papers or by Carver is Ernie Heﬂferle. He was a former 
end coach here, and had much to do with the develop-
ment of Mike Ditka, Joe Walton, Joe Kuzkeski, and Al
Grgliunas as top ﬂight ends. There _is one. name that
Carver hasn’t wished to divulge, and it may be Hefferle’s.

High school coaches are also being considered.
Earle Bruce from mighty Massilon, Ohio, is the most
prominent. His squad has won 20 straight games against
the top teams in Ohio. He has a huge budget to work
with .at Massilon, a luxury he won't enjoy here.

There is no use speculating on who will be the new
coach. It will have to be someone who has an inside track
to the talent in this area or some other football hotbed.
Whoever it is, Carver has promised a quick decision.

Hardly noticed, the collegevbasketball season sneaks into action tonight around
the country. The Panthers entertain Carnegie Tech at the Fitzgerald Field House at
8:15 this evening. The freshmen host the Tech JV’s in the preliminary at 6:15.

Last year, the varsity had no
trouble with the Tartans, win-
ning easily in both games played.
Tech may prove to be more
troublesome this time, however.
They have acquired through
transfer a senior with the un-
familiar name of Jim Brown.
Brown stands 6-6 and weighs
215 pounds.

“There’s no doubt that Brown
will add to their rebounding,”
said Panther coach Bob Tim-
mons. “He and Ray .Morrison,
»who was ineligible last year,
should improve. their ball club.
Morrison led them in scoring
two years ago with a fine out-
side shot. Tech also has a for-
ward that showed me ‘a lot of
potential as a sophomore in Jeff
Kalin.” '

Timmons failed to mention the
Tartan center who draws the
cheers. He's 5-10, his name's Don
Keefer, and-the outjumped Pan-
ther center Jim LaValley (6-6)
on the opening tap all four times
last year. ’
LaValley starts tonight despite
speculation during the practice
scrimmages that he would got

second string. “It’s the;experi-
ence,” said Timmons. “Bob
Thompson and Bill Buck should
see a lot of action once we get
into full swing.” 1

"Co-captains Larry Szykowny
and Bob Lovett are set at guard
and forward, respectively. Both
played well according to Tim-
mons in the scrimmage against
Youngstown last Saturday. Sopho-
more Ken Bollens starts at the
other forward spot and junior
Pete Smith opens at the other
guard.

“The Youngstown game was
our best effort so far,” Timmons
explained. “The rebounding pick-
ed up considerably both offen-

sively and defensively. Bollens‘

in Jarticular seemed more re-
laxed and consequently more. ag-
gressive under the boards.”
Defensively the hoopers have
two quick, ball-hawking guards
in Szykowny and Simth.Szykowny
can shoot; Smith will have to
show his offensive capalities to-
night. -
. The Panthers’opening defense
will be the basic pressure man-
to-man that has been used in the

IIS.

past. “We’ll stay with our reg-
ular defense. Tech uses either a
man-to-man or a zone, depending
on which works better for them,”
Timmons said.

Coach Tim Grgurich’s frosh
face a different type of ball club
_in the Carnegie Tech J V’s. Ac-
tually, no one knows anything
about them. “Being a small
school,” explained Grgurich, “Tech
has permission to play their
freshman on the varsity. Thus
it’s pretty likely that any top
ballplayer they have won’t face

9!

The Cubs will play around
eight’ “starters.” According to
Grgurich, the. freshman probably
won’t have a set starting ﬁve for
the entire season. ‘The eight boys
are Tim Fisher, 6-3; Al DiFris-

chia, 6-5; Tony DeLisio, 6-2; Dave‘

Welty, 6-0; Frank Clements, 6-0;
Len Kalata, 6-4; Sylvester Steven-I
son, 6-2; and Mel Cratsley, 6-1.

“In addition to those eight,”
said Grgurich, “we have four or
ﬁve others that we can depend
on. We have no problem as far
as depth is concerned.”

Last year’s second place
finish by the basketball team
in theSteel Bowl Tourna-

‘fment resulted because the

four team field was domin-

this year it’s a different story— _

the game is rated a toss-up with

no one team towering over the

other three. _

The tournament will. be held
in the Civic Arena ‘on Friday and
Saturday, Dec. 10 and 11. Game

T - shirts may be the only
good thing to happen to this
season’s edition of the swim-
ming team.

The reason for this is that
six swimmers are not starting the
season .on the right foot, or in
the case of Andy James and Jim
Beck, on the right arm.

James, the tankmen’s‘leading
swimmer last year, recently broke
his arm, can’t use it at full
strength because the arm swells
if it is over exerted.

Gary ’Martin’s name also ap-
pears on Ben Grady’s sick list.
Lately, he has been taking ﬂuoro-
scope tests to see if there is real
trouble with his stomach.

Grades are the main problems
of the other three swimmers —
’Enterline, Joe LeViere, and Pat
McGuire. For the ﬁrst two dual
meets against Michigan State and
North Carolina State, these three
sophomores are ineligible to com-
pete. ‘

This cuts Grady’s corps down

  Self - Taught Expert, Custodian

Of Heinz Chapel Officially Retires

A native of Rome, Italy who
has led so many tourists through
Heinz Chapel that he’s lost count
of how many, will retire from
the University early this month.

Victor Sciulli, a self-taught ex-
pert on Heinz Chapel and its
custodian and social secretary,
will leave officially, but return
often unofficially because, he
says, “I feel like the Chapel be-
longs to me.”

Originally hired as a janitor,
Sciulli began leading tours
through the Chapel as a courtesy,
and as a matter of personal inter-
est began a study of its windows,
architecture, and history.

)With powerful binoculars he
picked out the ﬁgures on the high
stained glass windows, and look-
ed each up in the Encyclopedia
Britannica. “They represent 2,000
years of history, religion, and art.
Did you know that?” he. said.

He studied how the glass was
made, the various styles of Gothic

architecture, and referred to the
original b uild in g /speciﬁcation.

The blue prints were easy for
him to understand because as a
construction engineer he had
helped to build many of Pitts-
burgh’s skyscrapers as well as
the East Liberty Presbyterian
Church.

Besides serving as the official-
unofficial tourist guide ,to the
Chapel, Sciulli has shouldered
some informal academic duties
as well. Frequently, he has help-
ed students who were studying
cathedral architecture. “I told
them what many world travelers
have told me: that this Chapel
is one of the ﬁnest anywhere.”

During his seven years at the
