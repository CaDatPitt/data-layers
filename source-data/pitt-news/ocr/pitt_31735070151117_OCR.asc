Pittsburgh’s‘ Democratic voters
turned out Tuesday to nominate
‘District 8 City Councilman Bill
Peduto as the party’s candidate
for mayor.

Former State Auditorjack Wag-
ner was Peduto’s closest contender,
but conceded therrace shortly af-
ter 1o p.m. Rep. Jake Wheatley,
D-Allegheny, came next, with
community organizer A._]. Rich-
ardson falling in last place. The
mayoral election, in which Peduto
will square off against Republican
Josh Wander, will not officially take
place until Nov. 5.

“On to November”
iPea’uz‘o pulls away in mayoral Democratic Primary Election

Wander said he had already
called Peduto to congratulate him,
adding that he expects Peduto will
be a “formidable opponent” in the
fall.

With more than 60 percent of
voters in Allegheny County regis-
tered as Democrats, the winner of
the Democratic mayoral primary
is the most likely candidate for the
position. Pittsburgh has not had
a Republican mayor in almost 80

a years.

When incumbent Mayor Luke
Ravenstahl announced his candi-
dacy in February, it looked like he
would easily beat out City Control—
ler Michael Lamb and Peduto, his
only competition at the time. But
on March 1, Ravenstahl announced
that he would not seek re—election,

   
  

reinvigorating Peduto’s and Lamb’s
expectations and opening the race
to several potential candidates. Ra-
venstahl later endorsed Wagner.
On March 12,-the oﬁicial dead-
line to appear on the ballot, seven
candidates announced they would

run in the Democratic primary. But .

Pennsylvania Sen. James Ferlo, City
Council President Darlene Harris
and ﬁnally Lamb dropped out of
the race. All three endorsed Wag-
ner.

When the polls opened Tues-
day morning, four candidates still
sought the Democratic nomina-
tion.

Richardson, a community orga-
nizer and licensed minister from
Sheraden, was working as a school
bus monitor when he surprised the
city by announcing his intent to

run for mayor. While the Brooklyn,
N.Y., native’s facial tattoos gener-
ated attention for him early in the
race, the spotlight fell on him when
he was arrested for driving under

the inﬂuence early in April. In the

days leading up to the election,
polls put Richardson as the least-
likely winner: Richardson had
committed to fostering a stron-
ger connection between the city’s

' marginalized communities and the

mayor’s ofﬁce. He also emphasized
his stance against discrimination
and police brutality.

Wheatley, of the Hill District,
served in the U.S. Marine Corps be-
fore beginning his political career
as executive assistant to Pittsburgh
Councilman Sala Udin in 1998. He
assumed his position as a mem-

Est. 1910

Vol. 104

ber of the Pennsylvania House of
Representatives in 2003 where he
presently serves the 19th District.
Wheatley emphasized his commit-
ment to combatting poverty in the
city. Of the three career politicians
running for mayor, Wheatley was
the only one who lived in a lower-
income neighborhood. Wheatley
received an endorsement from a
coalition of black community lead-
ers in the city.

Peduto, of Point Breeze, has
served District 8, the constituen-
cy that includes Pittsburgh’s East
End, since 2002. Peduto has been
clear about his intention to run
ever since he started a campaign
to run in 2007 before withdraw-

ing because of Ravenstahl’s over-
whelming popularity. Since an-
nouncing his nomination, Peduto
has run on a platform of improv-
ing transparency in Pittsburgh’s
government and helping the city’s
middle class. In polls of the city’s
voters immediately before the elec-
tion, Peduto appeared to be the
rr_1ost—likely winner.

Wagner, of Beechview, is a

U.S. Marine Corps veteran who 4

served in the Vietnam War before
he began his political career as a
member of City Council in 1984.
He held a council seat represent-
ing the 4th District for 10 years,
during four of which he served as
council president. He later rep-
resented the 42nd District in the
Pennsylvania Senate until 2005
and most recently acts as the state’s
auditor general. He argued during
his campaign that he was the most

qualiﬁed of the candidates

for the Democratic nomi-

nation. In the days before
the election, Wagner was consid-
ered Peduto’s strongest rival.

As of 11:30 p.m. Tuesday, more
than 99 percent of primary votes
had been counted. Peduto had re-
ceived 22,892, or almost 52 percent
of the Democratic primary votes,
more than 5,000 votes ahead of
Wagner, his closest rival, who re-
ceived 17,496 votes, or less than 40
percent. Wheatley came in third
with 3,419 votes, or less than 8

\percent of the Democratic pri-

mary vote. Richardson received
275 votes, or less than 1 percent
of Democratic votes.

under

construction until August

Gideon Bradshaw
News Editor

The lower level of the Wil-
liam Pitt Union will remain
closed until mid—August for
renovations. C

Volpatt Construction, the
contracting company that be-
gan working on theproject last
week, will demolish the ceiling
and floor in the lower level of
the building and install new
ones. Volpatt Construction will
also renovate Schenley Cafe,
the dining area located in the
Union’s lower level.

Pitt spokesmanjohn Fedele
said that, as part of the project,
the contractors will convert

the dining space in Schenley
Cafe into a Taco Bell. The eat-
ery already includes counters
for Culinary Classics, Fresh-
ens, Strutters, Pi.zza{ Hut, Sub
Connection and Nicol‘a"s_G'ar-
den... 9 _    —
Fedele s'aidvcori'tr_a:ictor,sv will
also upgrade finisliirigs in the
hallways and No-rd'y’s Place.
He added thatthe construc-
tion on the lower level cost
$1,024,800. He said that this
figure only includes the cost
of the construction itself and
does not include other costs

such as design and furnishings. -

For the duration of the
project, the Forbes Avenue
entrance, which leads to the

lower level of the :Union, will

be closed tothe public. The

entrances that lead into the
main floor of the building will

remain operational for the du-l

ration of the project. I V

Supporters of Bill Peduto pack into the Pittsburgh Federation of Teachers in the
South Side to celebrate his victory Tuesday night. Ben Brownlee | Staff Photographer

ELECTION

Election speech for the mayor of Pittsburgh.
The energy inside the hall reﬂected excite-
ment and anticipation as people of all ages
packed into the room. Bands of children
played musical instruments to keep the eager
crowd pleased while it waited for the results.
Peduto’s Director of Communications
Sonya Toler was “cautiously optimistic” as
she awaited the results of the voting.
Discussing Peduto’s recent surge in the
polls in the days leading up to the primary,
Toler said, “We have not changed our cam-

paign at all. This campaign was designed

to defeat Luke Ravenstahl, and we haven’t
change. Just the players have.”

When it was discovered that Wagner,
Peduto’s closest opponent, conceded the
race to Peduto, the crowd electriﬁed with
the bright lights of the room.

After Diana Peters, 49, of Shadyside,
learned that Wagner conceded the election,
she exclaimed,

As “We are the Champions” by Queen be-

gan playing in the crowded room, the Peduto _

supporters only became more exuberant.

Jon Richards, 26, a resident of South Side,
said that although he wasn’t a Peduto sup-
porter at the beginning, he has now become
a very fervent one.

“I am so proud to have cast my vote for
Bill and now feel wholeheartedly that I made
the right decision about a month ago to
change my voteto Peduto,” he said.

County Executive Rich Fitzgerald gave a
passionate speech congratulating the mem-
bers of the Peduto campaign and praising
the people who elected him.

“Did we change this city today or what?”

Fitzgerald said. “I am so proud of what this
campaign did over the few months. [Peduto]
has a vision for this city, a vision that goes
beyond his district.”

Fitzgerald hailed Peduto for the “coali-
tion of people he put together on this cam-
paign.” Saying that people of all genders,
ethnicities and sexual orientations came
together to make the campaign as success-
ful as it was. “As Bill says, ‘It doesn’t matter
where you’re from, what matters is where
you stand.”’

Chaz Bonasorte, 58, the owner of The Pitt
Stop in Oakland and a former Pitt football
player, was among the supporters waiting
to hear Peduto speak.

“Bill just knows what’s going on,” he said.
“He’s both young and qualiﬁed, and he has a
new and clear vision for this city.”

When Peduto ﬁnally took the stage, the
crowd of people cheered loudly for whom
they hopep to be their next mayor of Pitts-
burgh.

“We fought for a new Pittsburgh, and
we did it,” Peduto said. “We built a cam-
paign from the ground up, and there is no
way you can knock down a building with a
strong base.”

Peduto spoke of hope for the future of
Pittsburgh and of hope to rebuild what “our
parents and grandparents once built for us.”

“We’ve taken this city back, and it’s time
to clean it up.” He said. “Onto November.”

Wagner Camp

Wagner, the former auditor general of
Pennsylvania, conceded the Pittsburgh May-
oral Primary shortly after 10 p.m., when it
became clear that Peduto’s lead would carry
the race.

  (iPhone) pics or it didn’t

Sophia A1—Rasheed.
For The Pitt News

It’s Saturday night in Oakland,
and as always, my friends and I
go out with hopes of forgetting

, that the following five days exist.

Waiting to order the special of
the night, I see a group of girls
next to me huddled around a
round of what appears, from my
perspective, to look like a shot
of fire. Between the squeals and
the “oh my god!”s,_ I hear that
one phrase that anyone undoubt-
edly hears over the course of the
night: “I am so Instagramming
this.”

Now, I have a hard time be-
lieving that in this crowded set-
ting, a picture of ﬁre on a glass
through a “Valencia” ﬁlter will
look picture—worthy at all, but
‘almost all the girlsaround her —
except for the birthday girl, who
probably thinks she’s at a hibachi
restaurant atthis point — take
out their phones and commence
with the hashtagging,cropping
and sharing. Whatever it re-
gards, each one is completely
glued to her phone.

I understand the value of
having something to remember
signiﬁcant days like this, after
all, if it weren’t for documen-
tation, many 21st birthdays
would go without any memory
at all. But moments like these,
when smartphone users take a
signiﬁcant amount of time and

effort in order to simply show

what they’re doing to the out-
side world, make me question
whether we’re advantaged by
having access to these devices.
Wouldn’t it just be easier to say,
“Cheers!” take the drink and
not care if everyone else knows
about it? I can’t help but feel
that simple experiences, when

V stripped of outer judgment, were

much more enjoyable before the
smartphone era. a

That being said, I was critical
upon seeing the latest iPhone
. I ’ ' which focuses pre-
cisely on their smartphone. The

“candid” life scenes. The com-
mercial is unsurprisinglyartistic
andqequally unsurprising, it ca-
ters to a wide audience. We see
teenagers skateboarding, par-
ents cheering on their children
at competitions, nature lovers
in their favorite element and, of
course, tourists panoramically
capturing their latest destina-
tion. At the end of these heart-
felt moments, the commercial
boasts “everyday, more photos
are taken with the iPhone than
any other camera.”

My ﬁrst issue with the com-
mercial came from the fact that it
does not demonstrate the actual
quality and types of photos that
are so artistically captured from

the iPhone each day. If Apple is _

going to brag about this feat, I
would like the company to add
in some shots that actually rep-
resent the majority of iPhone
photos. Perfectly good examples
of this would include girls in the
standard hand—on-the-hip pose
in front of an insigniﬁcant ven-
ue — Olive Garden or a dorm
hallway for instance, a standard
grilled cheese that somehow de-
serves documentation or, most
easily, the selﬁe.

But the fact that the com-
mercial was unrealistic does
not serve as the main basis for
my disapproval. What I dislike
most is that it basically portrays

all of life’s signiﬁcant moments
being viewed behind the lens of
the iPhone —- a phenomena that
is proving quite realistic. As in
the case of the traveling birth-
day party mentioned earlier, it
appears that one’s experience
is worthless without the world
knowing about it.

Why do we let ourselves suc-
cumb to the anxiety of sharing
everything we do, as if our own
satisfaction is not enough? Is
it really worth the few “likes”
you’ll receive later to take away
from the moment you’re having
right now?

Of course I’m not saying that
the iPhone camera has com-
pletely ruined our experiences.
There are deﬁnitely moments
that we are blessed to be able
to capture. But maybe instead
of trying to use your iPhone to,
completely recreate experiences
for everyone else to see —— I’m
talking to you, people studying
abroad — we should consider
the value of photos when they
were scarce, didn’t depict us
in the same standard pose and
didn’t ﬁt into a square shape for
easy sharing. Instead of actively
waiting behind our screens to
document everything we do, we
should look up, enjoy the spon-
taneity that the night brings us

Vampire Weekend

Modem Vampires of the City
Grade: A

Rocks like: The pohderings
of a talented yet wayward
20-something set to music

If Vampire Weekend’s past work
was the story of a worldly, preppy

narrator, the band’s newest album

represents that college-aged yuppie

becorninga bit more serious and fas-

tening one more button on his pastel,
ﬂuorescent button—up shirt.

The band’s newest album, Mod-

ern Vampires ofthe City, is a 12—track
gentle pivot away from its previous

exploits that shows profound matu-

rity. For the first time in the band’s

tenure, its members talk about more

than collegiate mirth or how nice the

weather is halfway around the world.

Even though the slightest twinge of
less-than-preppy proves to be a big
change, Vampire Weekend still deliv-
ers a tantalizingly brave look into the
shadier parts of life while maintaining

what has become the fun, signature
and seemingly inexhaustible magne-
tism of its music. Here, listeners see
that the band has found its perfect
intermingling of light and dark. Lis-
teners should’ve received a warning
when they ﬁrst heard the lyrics of
“Step,” one of the album’s early re-
leased singles: “The gloves are ofﬁ
the wisdom teeth are out.”

Vampire Weekend’s self—titled
debut album was saturated with the
narrator’s upper rniddle-class ennui
and the lyrics from its second album,
Contra, read like his term paper for

manding task of satisfying the Trek—
kies forthe second time in aboutﬁve
years. “Star Trek,” the ﬁlm’s 2009
predecessor, which Abrams also
directed, found success, becoming
the ﬁrst Star Trek ﬁlm to receive
an Academy Award and receiving
positive critical acclaim, as well as
creating a Star Trek movie that was
palatable to a mainstream audience.
With such accolades behind him,
creating a ﬁlm that would match its
successes would be a serious under-
taking-

Although “Star Trek Into Dark-
ness” might not have reached the
heights of Abrams’ ﬁrst attempt,
the director and his crew deserve a
measure of praise. It might not have
satisﬁed the most hardcore Trek-

kies, but the ﬁlm was an all-around .

satisfactory work.

The major flaw in this ﬁlm was,
without question, the uninspired
plot. It was all too easy to follow
and quite predictable. Soon after

 C V‘ _ the movie started, it became clear

an upper-level modernist literature
course at Amherst. The band traded
in the island paradise beats of its
ﬁrst album when Contra rolled out,
trimming down slightly excessive,
atmospheric aesthetics and instead
slicing and dicing tracks into choppy,
toe-tapping melodies that seemed
abrasive, yet lovable. Modern Vam-
pires of the City is the best of both
worlds, mixing the delicate, “intel—
ligent Northeasterner” sound of the
ﬁrst album with the slick production

’ of the second. ,
The band’s old sprightly sprin-

in llllltlillliﬁﬁ‘ minute:

that the ﬁlm’s events would revolve
around the capture of Starﬂeet agent
John Harrison (Benedict Cumber-
batch), who bombedasecret Section
31 installation in London and then
ﬁred on an emergency meeting at
Starfleet Command, killing the new
Enterprise commander, Adm. Chris-
topher Pike (Bruce Greenwood). As
a result, James T. Kirk (Chris Pine)
was reinstated as captain of the En-
terprise. 1
Given that Kirk had been de-
moted to ﬁrst ofﬁcer for his risky ac-
tions on a mission during the movie’s
opening scene, the quick promotion
felt like cheap maneuvering on the
part of the writers. If Kirk’s demo-
tion had produced a greater effect
on the way the crew took him back,
the move might have made sense.
However, it had virtually no impact
on the plot athand. When Kirk was
reinstated, itwas as though nothing
had ever happened. He didn’t even
have to prove himself worthy of be-
ing a captain again.

Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman and
Damon Lindelof did not do abad j ob
with the dialogue. Spock (Zachary

humorous: Spock with his wit and
Scott with his ridiculous scenes.

INTERVIEW

Hunters’ Derek Wamon talks about energy, inﬂuences and injuries

John Lavanga
Arts and Emfertainment Editor

Hunters, aband based inBrooklyn, N.Y., has yet
to release a full LP, but it has generated plenty
of attention with its full—force live shows and
retum to the sort of raw, nerve—striking sound
that comes straight out of the early days of the
Melvins and the Pixies. At the forefront of these
performances are the catchy back—and—forths

‘between guitarist and vocalist Derek Watson

and Vocalist Isabel “Izzy” Almeida as they
bounce around on stage. On Friday, they’ll make
a stop at Brillobox — a venue located on Penn
Avenue in BIoomﬁeldi— withjeff the Brother-

hood, another band known for its ecstatic live ‘
performances. In the midst of a busy tour and b
all the bumps, bruises and drivingthat go along’. y
with it, Watson spoke to The Pitt News by phone  I I
to answer questions about the band’s musical .

style and life on tour. .

The Pitt News: There are a lot of live bands
that really can’t bring the same sort of force
and energy to their recorded work. When you
were recording your EP, Hands on Fire, how
did you manage to pack the energy of your live
performances into the studio‘?

Derek Watson: What we would do is we
would track everythingas aband together, and
then we’d do overdubs  but nothing super over
the top or, like, slick or anything.

To be honest, we were working with such

time constraints. Every time we would ever
go into the studio we were broke and trying
to get something done as fast as possible, so it
also deﬁnitely helps when you don’t have a lot
of options. Where you have to go in and record
everything in like a day or two, that deﬁnitely
keeps you in check in terms of not doing tons of
experimentation like 86 overdubs of maracas
and stuff like that.

TPN: Many listeners see a lot of early 90s
bands, such as the Pixies, in your sound. How
did you come to deﬁne your sound?

that Greg [Giuffre] and Tommy [Martin] really
like them as well.

a lot of times something that she wrote is really
similar to something thatl had in a different
way, and then we can combine them and make
a song. I think that’s why we wind up having to
sing songs back and forth because they work so
well. We sometimes just get lucky with lyrics.

Pitt baseball, ranked 16th in the na-
tion, entered the weekend series
against 10th-ranked Louisville with
an opportunity to secure the Big
East regular-season championship
and an all—but—guaranteed spot in
the NCAA tournament.

But three games later, the Pan-
thers saw their standing fall from
ﬁrst to third in the conference after
Louisville swept Pitt in three suffo-
cating games.

Pitt (40-15, 18-6 Big East) ends
its season on a sour note after the
Cardinals (46-10, 20-4 Big East)
swept the Panthers at Patterson
Stadium — a series that granted
Louisville the Big East regular-
season championship. Pitt ﬁnished
third in the conference and will
play St. John’s in the ﬁrst game of
the Big East tournament Wednes-
day in Clearwater, Fla.

Pitt set to play host

during Legends Classic in
fall

Nate Barnes
Assistant Sports Editor

Pitt men’s basketball will participate
in the 2013 Legends Classic at the
Barclays Center in Brooklyn, N.Y.,
according to an official release that
named the Panthers among four
host teams of the tournament.

As part of its non-conference
schedule, Pitt will host two games
in Pittsburgh at the Petersen Events
Center between Nov. 17-21. Pitt then
travels to the Barclays Center to play
on Nov. 25 and 26.

The four teams featured in the _

tournament are Pitt, Houston, Stan-
ford and Texas Tech. Of the three
other teams, Pitt is only slated to
play two of them depending on the
results of the tournament’s bracket.
Of the four host teams, Pitt was
the only one to qualify for the NCAA
tournament, and the team ultimate-
ly ﬁnished with the best record of
any host team in 2012-2013 at 24-9.
Pitt also ﬁnished the recent season

as the only team out of the four that
cracked the rankings, peaking at
No. 16 in February.

Pitt previously participated in
the 2008 Legends Classic hosted by
the Gazelle Group —— also respon-
sible for putting on the 2K Sports
Classic, Gotham Classic and College
Basketball Invitational —- during
which the Panthers won the tour-
nament title after defeating Texas
Tech and Washington State at the

‘ Prudential Center in Newark, N._].

Pitt forward Sam Young was

named the toumament’s Most Valu-

able Player. .

Past Legends Classic champions
include 2012’s preseason No. 1 team
Indiana, No. 18 Vanderbilt in 2011
and No. 11 Syracuse in 2010.

The Legends Classic adds to a
rion-conference slate of games that
will also see Pitt participate in the

Restoring Malkin’s line could g   
reignite Penguins’ scoring touch

Dave Uhrmacher
Sports Editor

Everyone knows this Pittsburgh
Penguins team can score.
When a team scores at a rate

of more than four goals per game «

in the playoffs, a one-goal perfor-
mance such as the two—overtime
thriller Sunday night in Ottawa
rings like warning bells in a ﬁre-
house full of sleeping servicemen.

Simply, panic can ensue.

The Penguins’ double-overtime
loss Sunday to the Ottawa Sena-
tors marks the ﬁrst time since the
beginning of the 2013 playoff cam-
paign that the team failed to score
four or more goals in a game.

Almost a month and _a half has
passed since the Penguins,-scored
just one goal in a game — on
April 5 to be exact, against Hen-
rik Lundqvist, the impressive New
York Rangers’ goaltender 9- and
this team is not used to scoring
droughts. V

There is one simple ﬁx to ensure

the Penguins continued to get pucks
past Ottawa’s Craig Anderson, who
is arguably the league’s best goal-
tender of the season: Reunite one
of the most proliﬁc lines in recent
hockey history.

It seems like an odd thing to do
in the ﬁrst place, separating a line
that boasted a ﬁrst-time 40 -goal
scorer injames Neal, a player who
cracked the top ten in points for
the ﬁrst time in his career in Chris
Kunitz and the reigning league
MVP in Evgeni Malkin. i

As the old adage goes, “If it ain’t
broke, don’t ﬁx it.” _

Shuflling potentialhall-o'f-fam-

er andltrade-deadline acquisition .

Jarome Iginla on a line with‘;Malkin
certainly has some advantages.‘
The line combination" allows
Malkin to do what he does best:
wheel freely around the neutral
and defensive zone with the puck
before a blazing breakout that you
might miss if you are busy reading
the nutritional facts on your third
Iron City Light of the evening. '

Iginla’s right—handed shot is a
weapon that any team must pre-
pared for or instead face the real
fear of Iginla deadly one-timer
ﬁnding twine.
~ But separating the Ma1kin- Ne-
al—Kunitz line decreases the effec-
tiveness of what the Penguins have
to do‘ to win. Namely, dumping
thepuck, winning battles on the
boards behind the opposing net
and turning those offensive zone
opportunities into points.

A The number of scoring catego-
ries this line led the league in dur-
ing the 2011-2012 season is almost
unbelievable.

Points (251), goals (116), post
and crossbar hits (33), game-win-
ning goals (13), power-play goals
(36), and the list goes on.

It is almost foolish to allow Neal

. and Iginla to swoop around wait-

ing for the perfect opportunity to
pull the trigger while the always-
critical net-front presence, Kunitz,

the game with ahome run to left onao-1 pitch
from Louisville starterjeff Thompson and put
Pitt on top 1-0 in the ﬁrst for the second con-
secutive game. But like Thursday, Louisville’s
pitching shaped up and held Pitt down while
the Cardinals’ offense went to work.

Thompson kept Pitt off the board until
the ﬁfth inning, but by the end of the fourth
inning, Louisville held a 8-1 lead and had the
contest ﬁrmly in its grasp. Pitt scored two
in the top of the ﬁfth, closing the gap to ﬁve
runs at 8-3 when inﬁelder Dylan Wolsonov-
ich walked with the bases loaded, and Vranka
picked up his second RBI of the day on a ﬁeld-
er’s choice.

But Louisville scored another two in the
bottom of the ﬁfth, running its lead to 10-3
and forcing] ordano to pull starter Matt Woth—
erspoon. Wotherspoon (9-2) lasted only four
and two-thirds innings and allowed 10 runs
on eight hits to Louisville’s hitters, following
a rough outing by Mildren with another dif-
ﬁcult start.

Another two Louisville runs put the Car-
dinals up 12-3 in the seventh inning, handing
Pitt its largest deﬁcit of the 2013 season. Pitt
scored a run in the‘ eighth on a RBI single by
Roche to score Vranka, but it wasn’t enough
to mount a rally.

“We got beat today,” Jordano said. “I don’t
think it was anything that we didn’t do, but it
was about what Louisville did. They swtmg
the bats very well, Thompson threw a very
solid game, and that was the difference.”

Game 3: Louisville 7, Pitt 4

Pitt threatened in the ﬁrst and second
innings by putting two runners on base but
couldn’t capitalize early against Louisville
starter Cody Ege. Pitt was unable to get on the
board until the fourth inning when the Pan-
thers scored two runs on RBI ground outs by
inﬁelders John Peluso and Sam Parente.

But by that point, Louisville already held a
5-2 lead on the strength of a ﬁve-run third in-
ning, which saw the Cardinals score on a wild
pitch, a pair of RBI singles and a two—RBI tri-
ple by outﬁelder Jeff Gardner. The runs were
all Louisville needed on Saturday.

Pitt starter Rhys Aldenhoven (8-1) lasted
two innings after that and ﬁnished after ﬁve
innings, allowing ﬁve runs on ﬁve hits and
two walks. The outing marked the ﬁrst time
this season that Aldenhoven recorded a loss.

Pitt closed its deﬁcit to just two runs in
the ﬁfth, with a RBI double by Soto to score
Vranka. Louisville then responded with a run
in each of the seventh and eighth innings to
extend its lead, 7-3.

With the bases loaded in the eighth and
ninth innings, Pitt only managed to score one
run on a ﬁelder’s choice by Evan Oswald in the
eighth.

“Obviously we’re disappointed that we
did not win today,”]ordano said. “However, I
really liked how hard we played and how we
continued to play that way to the ﬁnal out.”

The weekend’s sweep marked the second
time this season that Pitt lost a series, the ﬁrst
coming earlier in the year at South Florida.
Pitt ﬁnished in a tie for second with Seton
Hall, each with 18-6 conference records, but
the Panthers received the No. 3 seed in the Big
East tournament because of tiebreaker rules.

who scored so many of those garbage goals
a year ago, remains relegated to the wing
of that other star who plays center for the
Penguins, Sidney Crosby.

And now we have found the root of the
problem.

Head coach Dan Bylsma cannot continue
to focus only on the production of the unit
centered by Crosby, and instead, must make
the appropriate changes to all lines and stick
with them for the sake of creating a little

chemistry, which will help to score goals.
The wishes of Penguins, desperate to
ﬁnd Crosby an effective winger since what
seems like the Stone Age, have ﬁnally been
answered with the arrival of Iginla.
Statistics support the notion that it does

, not matter with whom Crosby plays because

he and all of the other players on his line
score. His point production has continually
increased since his career began.
