Business Bureau Reports

On Pgh.‘ Business Activity

Business activity in‘ the Pitts-
burgh district is on the same, gen-
eral level as last week, although
there were some gains and losses,
the Bureau of Business Research of
the University reports.

The seasonably adjusted index
stood at-145.9, a shade lower than
the preceding week. Steel produc-
tion and shipments, increased slight-
ly; trade remained the _same; and
coal production sagged. The recent
levels of combined indices are about
the same as those 0: the middle of

1941 and the spring of 1942.
Pittsburgh department stores

sales in the four weeks ending Ap-
ril 24 exceeded those of the cor-
responding four weeks of last year
by 2.6, per cent. The seventeen weeks’
total, of this year show, no signiiﬁ-
cant change from last year’; total.

Twenty-four beautiful coeds in
evening gowns will parade at the
Chili-Con-Carnival Thursday night
at 8 o’clock in Stephen Foster Mem-
orial hall, as the third event on
Spring festival schedule.

This big fun frolic boasts several
comedy acts with Ben Fleck, Stella
Brien, Otto Krenn, Dick Briney,
Bob Fitzpatrick and Dave Barber.
"They are terriﬁc,” according to
Jim Hardie, publicity..director of
Spring festival. _The Kappa Korus
will warble sweet tun-es.» Also easy
on the eyes will be the Andrews
trio, composed of Louise Caldwell,
Betty Adams, and Margie Strickler.

One of the most impressive num-
bers in the show will be a mass tap-
dance by Pitt’s best tapdancing tal-
ent. Another highlight will be the
Yankee» Doodle Dandy trio, a take-
off on the Warner Brosgﬁlm.

Among the original music in the

Oval” by Bob Goldsmith. Featured
vocalists include Lola Mae Marshall,
Jim Dunn, Ed Lauth, Betty Anne
Crede, and Norma Ebersole.

Peggy Fixel’s novelty act is one
of the many surprises in the show.
In ‘fact, from sitting in on one re-
hearsal, this reporter thinks the
show will be one big scream.

All activities on campus have been
invited to participate. Fraternities

_ and sororities are preparing short

ron To Leave

Pitt For Further Training

CARL EISENBEIS

Squadron E, made up of “a couple
of hundred men” of the Sixtieth
Air Crew Detachment‘ stationed

here at the University, will leave
Pittsburgh for the classiﬁcation cen-
ter at Nashville, Tennessee, “some-
time during‘ the first part of May,”
according to Lt. Wm. L. Levenson,
public relations officer of the detach-
ment. These men have completed
the course given at Pitt, and leave
to continue training at other sta-
tions.

At Nashville, these men will oili-
cially become aviation cadets, and
will be sent to numerous stations
in the United States to receive fur-
ther training as pilots, navigators,
or bombardiers.

Records of their training here
at Pitt will be sent to Nashville.
Complete statistics on their schol-

jug achievements will be included. .

as well as a report on each man's
general attitude towards train-
ing thus far; received. Future
training‘ and classiﬁcatioil will be

 

   

based upon these records. Some
may be eliminated from further
training in ﬂying due to deﬁcien- '
cies found to prevail upon exam-
ination. of these records.

While here at Pitt, these men
havereceived two months’ intensive
course in physics, mathematics,
English, military science, and drill,
and the customs and courtesic-s of
the service.

“These men have been taught to
understand the purpose of the train-
ing in which they are to participate
while performing duties in the fly.

out their two months here at the
University, they have performed
their duties in an excellent manner,”
said Lt. llevunson. ,
“All the men look l‘or\\'a1'd to

democracy we are today ﬁghting for, passed by -thehost of

 "students sitting on the lawn, observing the drill. Some of

illese students being respectful to their ﬂag, stood at fatten’-_

 tion, only to the laughs and quips of their fellow students.

. Standing for the ﬂag, and removing one’s hat and placing
__ it across and above the heart, is not a.n order, you are not
compelled to do it. There’s no one in back of you who will knock

you down if you do not.

. Quoting from the Infantry Drill Regulations of the
.:_ 'Army: “To the national colors: When passing or being
passed by an uncased national color or standard, honors are

. rendered by saluting when the color or standard is 6 paces
, away and is held until it has passed or has been passed by
6 paces.” A soldier follows the above instructions, but his

v uniform makes him no different from the civilian when

the flag is concerned.

This is the United States, where we do what we want
and answer to no “Adolphs” or “Benito’s.”
BUT a. simple pause midst some enjoyment to pay re-

. A spect to a symbol that many an American’s life is being given

willingly to preserve, should be no effort, or bother.

To still be able to stand proudly with all your friends and
“uncover” when the flag goes by is something that many a
Frenchman, Czech, or a Norwegian would gladly give every-

vthing in his power to do.

The Punch Press fever is really
spreading at a rapid rate among

‘By EL/\lNE K/°\H'N, Sports Editor

 p The sp.or.ts,staff lost its best reporter the other day when
 Carver went to the Army. It was a very ea.rnest kind
 Jokewhen Frank Car.ver’s name was included in the News
,«.t=i§§asthe,ad, for he not only collected most of the sports news,
 was on all occasions a willing‘source of information and
V_«st,ati_stics. There was only one story Frank Carver ever hedged
 ~,’e,’n-.and.that was the story of Frank Carver. He would not keep
“;his.pi_cture on ﬁle and ‘constantly refused to be interviewed
”.:‘,.. untilthe day before he left.
 One ofthe most sucessful sports publicists in the country,
¢,_g,3‘l7V_er‘lnS1Sted that he just “backed into the job as I backed
into‘ everything else.” It all happened because he signed" up
yfora chemistry class in his freshman year without bothering
. gtoﬂﬁnd out where the class was held. He discovered soon
ienoughthat it was held in the old oil and mines buildin in
= ‘hack of practice ﬁeld. The idea of climbing the hill did not
i ,‘appeal to him so he sought a class held at the same hour that
4,,would be both agreeable and accessible. “The only thing left
fwas journalism,” he recalls, “and that is how it all began.”
‘ Shortly thereafter he became assistant to Don Saunders
;who was then handling the sports publicity. And ironically
enough, from 1929 until the present, he walked that hill
- ~.,several times a day. When Saunders left he assisted Fred
"Turbyville. When Turbyville left he assisted Chick Kenny.
1 And when Kenny left he took over the job. ‘
 Although he saw a lot of football games during his tenure
. of oﬂice, Carver lists the 1932 Pitt-Army game as his favorite.
‘..‘‘It was the perfect game. Fifet Pitt would score; then Army
{would score. Then ‘Pitt would score. And then Army didn’t
score. With two minutes to go, Army had the ball on their
"own twenty. And. the next thing w-e knew, the ball was on the
* ‘Pitt nine. I still get a kick out of remembering that row of
§New York newspapermen, all dressed alike in yellow polo
écoatsand brown hats, standing 0 ntheir feet those last few
seconds vainly coaching that Army team to a touchdown. But
§Pitt won 18-13.”
 _ Although he traveled all over the country with the teams,
{his favorite city is Lincoln, Nebraska. “Pitt is the home team
_ gout there, he declared. “They’ll probably burn the town down
ifif Nebraska ever wins a game.”. » I . e‘
f Frank Carver ’-is known, liked, and respected throughout
jthe country both as a person and as a publicity man. But, he
‘ {finds highly ironic the recent letters of congratulation he has
".§_feceived on his handling of Shaughnessy publicity. ‘‘I ha.ven’t

Gibbons, but he had a front row seat from which to watch the
Bise, Decline and»Fall of the Sutherland Empire. And in that
period, when animus, distrust, and bad feeling were the order
(if the day, Frank Carver emerged with more friends than
ever. That alone shows the kind of a guy he is.

Our Panthers who won’t have a chance to lose anotheil

ball" game until Saturday when the

take on the Army, 

well spend the intervening days me itating their various sins

of omission (three in number
WINS). s

a.nd all in the column headed.

. _~..,

Of the three defeats suffered so far, two might easily:

have been wins. Indeed, the Navy contest which they lost 7-1',
were out, it is evident that the

was the only game in which the
Panthers did not actually work
overtime to beat themselves. Weird
ﬁelding plays, shoddy base run-
ning, and. erratic pitching brought
on the Juniata and Bucknelle de-
feats. Although the boys would
just as soon forget that Juniata
contest when they kicked away an
8-0 lead in the last. two innings, all
felt that poetic justice had been
served when the same Juniata team
blew away a 7-1 le_ad to Bucknell
three days later.

Even though you would never
suspect it from their record, the
1943 iPanthers actually have a
pretty fair ball club. The inﬁeld,
which last year made a, seive seem
like an air tight vault, has tight-
ened up. And this is due in no small
measure to Angie Cai-laccini’s im-
pressive .<l‘.?)1"£Sl:0pplng'. Red Pat-
terson has also turned in an ex-
cellent job at first base. In the
/three games played thus far, Red
has handled thirty-ﬁve chances
without an error.

There has been no particular
scarcity of base hits in the last. two
contests and, as the majority of the
runs have been scored after two

team’s trouble is not a lack of “pay-
dirt” hitters. Actually the Panther
troubles are all contained in the
error column. In three games they
have collected a total of 15. Add to

this some seven passed balls, three _

hit batsman, two tipped bats, and
three wild pitches and you have

the story of the ‘Panther failure. to

date. .

The Panthers will meet Army
Saturday at Annapolis. The follow-
ing’ Tuesday they will play their
second home game in a return
match with Juniata.

Senior Nurses J
Will Graduate

Semester Earlier

“Nursing has become the great-
est war time work with a future."
said Dean Ruth Kuehn of the
School of Nursing. “There is a
double incentive for women in
nursing, today, because there is an
-immediate demand in the army.
navy, and civilian life, and nurses
are assured of a stable economic-
future.

“For the iii-st time in the his-
tory of the University, seniors in
the School of Nursing are graduat-
ing one semester early because the
need for trained nurses has in-
creased so greatly,” announced
Dean Kuehn.

For the dui‘ation of the war,
students will be admitted to the
School of Nursing every semester.
This decision was made because,
6,500 girls must enter nunrsing in
Pennsylvania between September
E1943 and June 1944.

The Federation of Women's
Clubs has organized scholarship
drives as part of their war work
to aid prospective nursing’ stu-
dents.

Pitt Nursing School is aiding
their women by shortening the
Eregular five year course to twenty
eight months. The college training
‘plus practical work should amount

‘ 1% three years and eight months.

all classrooms and solicited pledges
for war bonds. Apprmzimately
$5,100 was pledged that day, so
that total sales for Wednesday
amounted to $11,206.36, by far the
highest amount ever taken in dur-
ing a single day in the history of
the drive.

Sophomore class in the school of
dentistry pledged 100 per cent, the
best record For any single campus-
group.

Everyone who has made a
pledge is asked to pay it out by
tomorrow, since the stamp and

Since last September, the drive
has taken in over $29,000, and the
grand total for the entire drive. ini-
