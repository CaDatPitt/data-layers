Regis tra tion Brings
Campus Index And Old
Stories Back To Campus

By ROBERT SAFFRON

Faculty Bizarre . . .

Faculty Club swank 17th
floor penthouse late last week
was the scene of bizarre activ-
ity as members became “class”
conscious, pinned onto them-
selves .badges bearing gold
stars in numbers varying from
one to four.

Motivating this activity was the
jovial acceptance of a rating ad-
ministered by University students
in the Campus Index, unauthor-
ized, student-edited publication
which evaluated professors and
departments, graded them by star
ratings. Four stars meant excel-

lent; one, poor.

Among the incidents was the
formation of a Two-Star Club, a
special table where only four-star
professors might sit, and glib ex-
cuses in bridge games, such as:
“What can I do? My partner’s
only a one-star man.”

Some few faculty men wore
their badges into registration
headquarters where their eso-
teric signiﬁcance was for the
most part lost.

For some students, the Index
helped make registration a coun-
terpart of the scene in the latest
Marx Brothers horse opera where-
in Groucho must refer to a long
series of pamphlets in order to
make his choice. From catalogue
to time schedule to study list to
Campus Index and back again was
the trail . . .

Comments on the Index ranged
from “good, bad, indifferent,
sincere, slapstick, prejudiced,
unbiased, ‘It shouldn’t appear
on campus,’ ‘It’s a healthy stu-
dent activity,’ ‘I’d like to throw
all those damn things down a
sewer,’ etc., etc."

Sad, Sad Story . . .

Among the students returning to
register last week was a young
sophomore named Clarence whose
tale of woe was peculiarly touch-
mg.
At high school he had been a.

straight A student, and last year
he had intended to become the
same at the University. First
semester he whipped through
with a straight 3.0, but he had a.
little trouble the second semes-
ter, at the end of which this
story begins.

Clarence had completed all his
ﬁnal exams with the exception. of
mathematics, at which he was a
whiz.

And he anticipated another A.
The exam was duck soup for Clar-
ence; he went through it in half
an hour, ﬁnishing while his class-
mates were in the initial pencil-
chewing stage. Then he began to
ﬁnd time palling on his hands.

Believing that he was not al-
lowed to leave the room, how-
ever, Clarence took up some
blank paper and began writing’
all the things he had learned in
the course.

Clarence worked fast, was deep-
ly involved in the mysteries of the
hyperbolic parabola when his pro-
fessor approached his chair. Clar-
ence looked up, gave a typical
second-semester freshman’s grin.
The professor didn’t grin back.

He examined the paper, looked
at Clarence’s divertimenti with
which he had whiled away an
hour, looked back to the exam
D3rD€l‘-

“Tsk, tsk,” saidsthe professor,
“cribbing, eh?” Explanations were
ignored. Clarence’s blueprint
contained four A’s, one F . . .

Sophomore Clarence registered
for a second-semester freshman
mathematics course last week.

CA To Hold

Dr. Root Talks

To Freshmen

 At Banquet 

A large audience of freshman
men and upperclass counselors
packed the Memorial Hall ban-
quet room last Thursday evening
for what was proclaimed to be
one of the most informal freshman
banquets in recent years.

At the speakers’ tables were
men representing every school and
activity in the University. Under
a dictum set down by toastmaster
Montfort Jones, professor of bank-
ing, only three speakers were al-
lowed _ to ,address the ﬁrst year
men.

Principal speaker at the ban-
quet was Dr. W. T. Root, dean of
the Graduate School and psy-
chologist at the Western Peniten-
tiary.

In his speech, Dr. Root set down
six essential traits for a well—bal-
anced education and a wholesome
personality. First, he named a
technical training of a practical
nature, following that up with a
demand for a hobby.

“Self-analysis, the power to ac-
cept cheerfully dné’s ‘limlita-tions,”
came third on Dr. Root’s list. He
considered essential a tolerance
for the views of others, as well as
the power “to resist suggestions,
such as radio advertising.” For
his sixth point, Dr. Root set down

Fraternity

Guide Published

In the format of the last two
years with the addition of classical
apothegms and action pictures,
lnterfraternity Council, with its
elected editor, Ray Light, issued
the 1937-1938 edition of the Fra-
ternity Handbook to ﬁrst—year
men at the freshman banquet last
Thursday.

Following the editor’s foreword
are messages from Dean Lanfear
and Mr. Corley on the opportuni-
ties and purposes of University
fraternities. Each fraternity re-
serves a page in the hand book
for a group picture and biogra-
phies.

A complete listing of the rush-
ing and initiation rules, a chart of
fraternity scholastic standings, and
a tabulation of average costs per
member for pledgeship and mem-
bership are included.

Various News

The News office, 817 Cathedral.

First meeting scheduled is for
prospective members of the cir-
culation staff who will meet with

Elliott Teaches
New Course
In Painting

As a means of fostering appre-
ciation of art this semester, the
Fine Arts department of the Uni-
versity is instituting a new course
in “creative methods,” which will

   

give students a‘chance to learn

how the various techniques of the
principal schools of painting have
been created and used.

The course wil be taught by
Phillip Elliott, assistant professor
of the department, and will be
given during the fourth hour on
Tuesday and Thursday.

Actual studio work will be done
by those enrolled in the course.
Thus, students may learn by act-
ual experimentation how the
Renaissance Venetian school se-
cured such brilliant blues and
golds; why the colors of the Van
Eyck brothers have lasted for six
centuries without fading; and how
the modern American “primi-
tive,” George Biddle, can keep his
water colors from running into
each other. I ‘ “

Besides the actual painting
work, the class will mix oils,
grind pigment, and learn how to
mix egg yolks to their proper con-
sistency for tempera work.

By actual research, students will
be able to judge for themselves

_ why lVlichelangelo’s Sistine Chapel

frescoes are such great art works
instead of becoming befogged by
such. vague terms as “Chiarose-
curo, “modeling,” “feeling for
form,” and other like phrases.

An entire studio on the new sev-
enth ﬂoor headquarters of the ﬁne
arts department has been set
aside for the class, and equipment
for the work is rapidly being in-
stalled.

Panther Out  
Wednesday

Magazine Features
Question Column

According to schedule and
Thomas Smith, C37, editor, the
Pitt Panther will appear on cam-
pus this Wednesday.

And according to Smith, also,
the book will feature, among other
things, a new column: "Under a
Bushel,” with Betty Brooke, C39,
and Bernard Cashdollar, BA39,
collaborating. The column which
will replace last year’s “Lantern
of Diogenes” will aim at the more
subtle forms of question and an-
swer routine.

For example: “What is a Pek-
ing duck?” We don’t know. But
somebody might.

Other features include a double
page of information on the Panther
eleven, released by the publicity
office, men’s and women’s fash-
ions, a resume and critique on
“swing” by Jean Barnes, C39, and
a pseudo-surgical story by Dick
Hicks, E39.

 

Used Book
Exchange
Opens

Men’s Council
Starts New
Project Today

Men’s Council’s newest project,
the used book exchange launched
last May opens for business this
morning at 11:30 o’clock in 801,
Cathedral.

Offering to students the oppor-
tunity of disposing of last year’s
textbooks at attractive prices, the
exchange will be open daily from
11:30 to 3:30 o’clock to receive and
sell useditexts.

Even with the books already in
stock, the Men’s Council exchange
will be able to dispose of many
more texts than it now has regis-
tered, according to John Glasser,
BA38, council president.

“To avoid the rush at the end
of this week, bring in your used
books today or tomorrow to be

sold by the exchange,” urges
Glasser.
Outstanding features of the

campus’ newest exchange are the
facts that the books are ,handLed
directly by the exchange and that
the sale price may be set by 
student when he deposits his books
for sale. This eliminates the an-
noying use of a card index and
the necessity of locating the own-
ers of books after the cards have
been found.

Students leaving "books with the
exchange will receive a receipt,
and will be notiﬁed and paid as
soon as the books have been sold.
Owners may either specify the
sale price of their books or allow
the exchange management to set
the cost.

De1ifaT School

Occupies

Dental students will meet this
semester in a rearranged and
newly equipped «School of Dent-
istry.

The School is entering upon the
third year of its new four-year
curriculum this year with regis-
tration scheduled for today. Ac-
cording to Dr. H. E. Friesell, dean
of the professional school, the new
set-up has necessitated a rear-
rangement of laboratories, a
change in courses oﬁered, addi-
tional equipment, and more space.

The dental library, one of the
most complete in the United
States, is being installed in the
old Mellon "Institute building on
O’Hara street, directly across the
street from the Dental Inﬁrmary.

New quarters for the library
will not only provide access for
students and faculty to the litera-
ture of the profession, but will
provide more space in the inﬁrm-
ary ‘building, where‘ the library
was previously housed.

An approximate regist'ra.tion increase of 10 per cent in
almost every department of the University has caused the re-
arra.ngem.ent of most of the University oﬁices and has central-
ized all a.ct.ivit.ies and classes, except those of the professional
schools, in the Catliedral for the coming year.

Lantern Night
Ceremony Scheduled
For Weclnesday

With Father Pitt leading them
through the gates of knowledge,
freshman women will participate
in Lantern Night, the ﬁrst of a
series of traditional events spon-
sored by women’s organizations
on campus.

Assﬁnblirig on Wednesday even-‘
ing at 7:30 o’clock on the green
between State and Thaw Halls
the freshmen, in mentor groups,
will be welcomed by Evelyn Lowy,
C38, in the role of Father Pitt.
The Lantern Night ceremony
symbolizes the formal induction
of freshmen into life at the Uni-
versity.

With lanterns lighted from thel
ﬂame of knowledge, the procession
of freshmen will parade up the
campus drive to Heinz House
where Alma Mater will greet them
and offer counsel in the conclud-
ing‘ ceremony.

Thyrsa Agness Amos, C38, as
president of the Women’s Self-
Government Association, will take
the part of Alma Mater. Other
parts in the ceremony will be
filled by Marie Powell, C39, chair-
man of the traditions committee;
Lea Goldstein, C39; Mary Jane
Beachler, C38; Ruth Hilsenrath,
C39; Mary Jane Patterson, C39;
Mary Lee Nicholson, Ed39; and
Miss Mary Louden, instructor in
psychology.

Members of Cwens, honorary
activities fraternity for sophomore
women, the traditions committee,
and the WSGA Commission will
assist in the program.

J. P., P. J.
Confuse Things

A new headache for the office
of the registrar is the result of
registration this week. Two
brothers from Scranton, Pa., are
almost certain to get their grades
and courses mixed. They are
Paul John Dennebaum and John
Paul " "Dennebaum. The  Denne-
baums are freshmen.

6 With about 80 per cent of the

Cathedral ﬂoor space now availa-
ble for use and its ﬁrst three ﬂbbrs
available for recitation and lhctizite
classes, all of Alumni Hall 
been vacated and, on completion

‘ _of present plans, will be converied
G ‘into a. completely modern chemis-

try laboratory. '

Total student registration, which
began last week, showed a decided
increase over last year, due large-
ly to the large freshman class and
new transfer students.

INCOMPLETE FIGURES

Incomplete registration totals
showed freshman, sophomores, ju-
niors, seniors, and graduate stu-
dents registering in larger num-
bers. The larger numbers might
also be credited to the inﬂux of
students from the disdbntinuect
Frick Training School, who will
enter the School of Education. A

The School of Engineefing and
Mines closed its entrance» at long

before the beginning of . gistra-
tion because of the enggnous
number of applications. 
to the maximum, the school will
use the space in Thaw Hall pre-
viously allotted to the department
of chemistry.

Some time during the coming
year, the administrative offices and
classes in State Hall will be trans-
ferred to the Cathedral, and the
building will be transformed into
laboratories for the Schools of En-
gineering and Mines.

FINE ARTS MOVES

The ﬁne arts department has al-
ready been transferred to the sev-
enth floor 0:‘ the Cathedral. The
ﬁne arts collection, one of the two
most complete in America, is now!
being installed.

Work is also in progress on the’
new women’s student health serv-
ice in the Cathedral. One wing of.
the eighth ﬂoor is to be utilized‘...
On the same ﬂoor, ivill be addedi
the offices of the Dean of Wonzen.—
Thc University YMCA office is be-~
ing moved to the ground floor.

The old Mellon Institute build?-
ing has been made available-for"
classes since the completion of the"

new structure. Medical research»
will be conducted there, giving the‘
Medical School more room for aw
increased registration. The Den-
tal School Library will also be
moved to Mellon Institute.

Frame buildings, purchased from
the United States Government
after the World War have been
used as chemistry laboratories.
These buildings are to be aban-
doned and torn down as a result
of the added space now available-
in Thaw, Alumni, and State Halls.

‘Scientiﬁc Research Is Man’s
World,’ Dr. Warga Warns

A

Woman Scientist ' l

Tells Difficulties
Of Careers

Men don’t want to believe that
an attractive woman, in high-
heeled shoes, wearing a smart,
stylish dress and a smart coiffure,
“knows her stuff” in science.

So says Dr. Mary Warga, lec-
turer in physics at the University.
Since 1928, Dr. Warga has been a
research scientist at the Mellon
Institute and an instructor in
physics and spectorscopy.

“If you should be asked, ‘Is
there a future for young men in
scientiﬁc research?’ you would, of
course, reply that it depends on
the individual man.-—his ability to
co-operate with his colleagues;
his personality and its effect on his
job-getting and his ability to pro-
duce results of value,” Dr. Warga
says.

“But with women, that is just
part of the story.”

Men, says Dr. Warga, think that

That—marriage—is the reason

hires a man as an anlyist in its
laboratory, it is certain he will
stay there for many years, unless
he is offered a much better posi-
tion. And if he is as valuable as
all that, of course his original ena-
ployer can well afford to raise his
salary.

Doubtless there is a field of op-
portunity for women, continues
Dr. Warga. A woman who knows
the chemistry of textiles and has
good taste in clothes is probably
a rare combination, and should be
valuable to industry or business.

Are Like Black,

EVIERELY by a_ hair’s breadtli does the present controversy

over Mr. Justice Black escape
American history.

has turned out to be a ineniber

being the: funniest incident in"

Only its incipient gra.vity could temper
laiigliter at the spectacle of the great “liberal” who, it‘ appears,

of the Ku Klux Klan.

The thing that saves the situation from being laughed to
death is that no inattfer what the outcome, the “crisis” will
seriously inhibit a. needed reform of the high court.

of Black is a cooked-up job, even
if all the charges are true. Neith-
er the desire for truth nor the de-
sire for justice are the criteria
which prompted the inquiry; it
was sheer partisanship, and it had
for its aim more than just causing
Back embarrassment or forcing
him to resign.

Liberals Wobble

As usual, the liberals, those
who supported and applauded
Black’s nomination, are quite
non-plussed as to what attitude
they should take. They don't
quite know whether to feel’
righteously indignant at the “ex-
pose” or whether to wall at
Black for using his liberal sena-
torial wiles to seduce them. And
they are fearfully afraid of a
shotgun wedding.

If Black were the only Ku
Kluxer that had ever held high
r-ilice in the United States, there
would be, I think, adequate jus-
tice in the liberals eschewing
him as not ﬁt for the company
of good men and true.

Black Got Caught

But, whether it can be proved
or not, it is a common assumption
that he is not the only one. Black
was merely unfortunate enough to
get caught with the goods—which,
above all else, is a grevious po-
litical sin. A _

I do not see much point in fur-
ther abusing the Ku Klux Klan in
print by saying that I could not,

On the face of it, the “expose”¢

least sympathy with it. But it is
best to risk repetition by stating
that the Klan did its best to plumb
the nadir and very frequently suc-
ceeded.

Progressive Voter

However, this conclusion seems
obvious to me in the present in-.
stance. If Black, a Klansman,
voted in the Senate as he did (with
the sole exception of the anti-
lynching bill), and all Klansmen
are like Black as the editorial
charges reversely declare, then by
all means let’s have more Klans-
men in public office.

Even it‘ Black is, as has been
alleged, a representative of an
unholy‘ pressure group, it would
not be the first time that such
a man has had a seat on the
Court bench. Possibly there has
never before been a. Klansman,
but there have been agents of
interests nearly as unholy, 
not as puerile.

If these men, as history tells
us, were ableto overcome their
natural bias because they were
exceptional individuals, then
Black who is pconcededly an ex-
ceptional individual, can surely
scale » the same Olympian
heights.

It is worth noting that there are
ﬁelds in which women do better
work than men. It is recognized
that women are better equipped
than men for painstaking, detailed
laboratory investigations. The bi-
ological sciences are examples.

It should be noted that while on
the job a woman scientist's per-

sonality is of little valueito her,

comments Dr. Warga. Like men,
she must produce results. A pret-
ty smile can never be offered as a
substitute for a much-sought-
after reason for a bad batch of
steel or a formula for that new
vitamin or the distance of that
new star. A woman in the labo-
oratory must wear a smock or a
uniform. And that unfortunately
sometimes becomes a habit. These
outside the laboratory are as. Well

Grid Practice Shortened
As Classes Are Opened

Two Backfield
Places Remain
Undecided

With the ba.ck—to—class move-
ment beginning in earnest to-
day, Dr. Jock Sutherland’s
Panthers had their football
study hours changed to one
class a day and the text concen-
trated on the chapter entitled
“Ohio \Vesleyan, September
25.”

Camp was broken yesterday as
the Panthers moved out of the
Pittsburgh Athletic Association
which took the place this year of
the ﬂood-ridden bunks of Camp
Hamilton, the former pre-season
training site in the mountains of
Windber.

Practice sessions have been go-
ing on since Labor day when the
squad assembled on the campus.
‘These have consisted of two drills
.a day, ‘one in the morning, the
other in the afternoon, with a
blackboard meeting thrown in
after lunch.

With a table set-up in the Uni-
versity Cafeteria, strict training
rules were observed during the
entire two week training period.

GOLDBERG GOES DOWN

Reports from up on the hill in-
dicate that there are 58 players
trying to ﬁ.t into the 11 starting
positions. In some of these places

-the assignments won’t be made

before 2 o’clock, Saturday, when
the team steps out on the Stadium
turf.

Injuries, for the most part, have
been of a light nature. Nothing
has happened to endanger the
.season’s play of any of the grid-
ders, but a few have had to cut
practice classes. Marshall Gold-
berg, Pitt's great halfback, spent
three days on the rub-down table.

Goldberg is back in uniform, a
knee infection having been nipped
in its ﬁrst stages, and will join
the drills tomorrow. The day
after Goldberg went out, his
fragiley built understudy, Johnny
Urban, banged his knee in scrim-

mage. He, too, is back in uni-
form.
Frank Souchak and Paul

“Bomber" Shaw have been out of
the scrimmages with similar ail-
ments. Souchak reported with a
twisted ankle which isn’t fully
strong yet and Shaw bruised his
leg.

Frank Kristufek,
tackle, who had been coming
along rapidly, and Jim Scarfpin,
reserve tackle who was out of
school last year, have also been 0
the sidelines. "

BACKFIELD POSTS
UNSETTLED
The battle still rages for the
fullback and quarterback posts.
Bill Stapulis and Frank Patrick
have given the line-backing-up

spot a dual character. Stapulis
seems to have whatever edge
there is.

Chickerneo has been stealing a
little bit of that signal calling bark
from Michelosen and the senior
veteran is just about on even
terms with the gentleman who
committed that famous block
agaist Ohio State.

Another threat to the two man
ﬁght for quarterback is sophomore
Ben Kish. He has looked mighty
capable in backing up the line.
Press agentry has noticed a simi-
larity in his style of play and that

of the former Pitt All American,’

Miller Munjas. ~

Marshall Goldberg and Harold‘~

“Curly” Stebbins, have been given
the two halfback positions. Steb-
bins succeeds Bobby LaRue.
George Delich has been ﬁlling in
for the graduated All-American,
Ave Daniel, and rolY‘P01Y Biff
Glassford’s guard vacancy has
been taken by Walt Raskowski,
another roly-poly.

Stebbins hasn’t had any second
team disturbance in his succession
to the halfback post, but the oth-
ers are none too secure. Delich is
only one block ahead of Ralph
Hafer, a sophomore who has been
knocking 'em down. Raskowski
ﬁnds himself in danger of being
pushed out by his roommate, Al
Lezouski.

Daddio, Shaw, Matisi, Petro, and
Hensley are first in line for the
other line places.

THE PITT NEWS

Wettach Athletic Awards

Given To Tost, Cassiano

Some one once said that where
there’s a strong back there’s al-
ways a weak mind, a saying which
seemed to be gaining some head-
way until C. D. Wettach, chair-
man of the University Athletic
Council established the C. D. Wet-
tach Awads in 1935.,

Each year they are awarded to
the outstanding senior student on
any of the=University squads, and
to the outstanding freshman ath-
lete with the best classroom
marks. Until this year an award
was also made to the outstanding
student on the varsity football
team. -

This year the awards were won
by Richard Cassiano of Albany,

N. Y., and Harold Tost of Pitts-

burgh. Cassiano did a ﬁne job of
quarterbacking the freshman team
last year and has been shifted to
halfback, where he understudies
Goldberg and Urban. Tost has
been a mainstay on the track team
for three years and holds records
in the mileand two mile runs.

The awards, gold wrist watches‘
engraved with the names of the
winners, were presented to Cas-
siano and Tost at a luncheon by
the athletic "council in July.

In 1936 the awards were made
to Ted Roderick, captain of the
basketball team; Nick Kliskey,
captain of the football team; and
to Robert Dannies, who held down
the first team center job on the
freshman football squad.

Freshmen

Campers
Return

Student Leaders,
Faculty Heads
Finish Weekend

As conclusion to the scratching
pen points, schedule-jumbles, and
advisory lectures came the fresh-
man camp session in the Kon-O-

' Kwee Valley of Zelienople last

week-end.

The three-day pre-school re-
treat, the pioneering work of John
Holbrook, E34, and E. A. Hol-
brook, dean of the Schools of En-
gineering and Mines, some seven
years ago, is sponsored by the
University and the YMCA.

Freshmen, together with select-
ed upperclassmen, and with facul-
ty members, began their joint ses-
sion last Friday, and ﬁnished yes-
terday. Events included in the
program were talks by deans and
faculty members of the various
schools, a stunt night presented
by the campers, and the Chinese
chef’s Sunday chicken dinner.

FINNEY LEADS BAND

Members A of the University
Band, led by Theodore M. Finney,
director of instrumental music at
the University, gave freshmen a
chance to learn the University
songs and cheers. Tennis, mush-
ball, volleyball, and basketball
were on the sport program, with
the addition of swimming and
boating, with the cooperation of
Connoquenessing Creek.

At four round table discussion
during the camp period, freshmen
were given an opportunity to learn
the why and wherefores of campus
life. Directing the “bull sessions”
on activities were student leaders
representing fraternities, publica-
tions, dramatics, military groups,
government associations, and other
student groups.

ARRANGED BY SCHOOLS

~Managing this year's Freshman
Camp was Albert Kairys, BA39,
member of SFA Assembly, Owl
staff, YMCA Cabinet, and Pitt
Riﬂes. Assisting him on the camp
committee were Robert Gump,
Ed38, YMCA president; Harold
Viehman, C39; Lou Reilly, M39;
Al Barr, BA38; and Harry Gilbert,
assistant secretary of the YMCA.

Housing at the camp was ar-
ranged according to school divi-
sions. Directors of these groups
were: College and pre—profession-
al—John Gerber, assistant profes-
sor of English, and Bernard Mc-
Kenna, C39; pre-medical — John
Kurtz, Med38, and Bill Kunkel,
C39; Engineering and Mines——W.

Chinese Art Exhibit Formally Opened

New Fine Arts Galleries Contain Paintings

By ROBERT BROWN

The exhibit of Chinese art of
the Sung dynasty, now being
shown in the galleries of the ﬁne
arts department on the seventh
floor of the Cathedral, is the open-
ing exhibit in the department’s
new headquarters.

Part of the collection is from the
Pennsylvania Museum of Art, and
part from the reproductions in the
departmental library, will remain
here another week.

One reason it is interesting is
because of the “undeclared” war
raging between China and Japan
at the present time. A curious
paradox is the fact that these two
peoples who can handle the ar-
tist’s brush with such grace and
reﬁnement can, at a moment’s no-
tice, pick up bayonets and use
them convincingly.

MODERN TREND TRACED

The second reason why the cur-
rent show is so pertinent is be-
cause of the fact that the annual
Carnegie International exhibit is
scheduled for next month. Art
experts can trace the competent,

bold line of Picasso, Matisse,
Derain, and others of the signiﬁ-
cant moderns back to the almost
legendary ﬁgures of Wang Wei
and Tao Lin who painted in the
employment of the powerful
North and South Sung family.

Here’s how they do it. Budd-
ism was carried into Japan from
China about the 6th century B.C.
Before that time, Japan was in a
practically prehistoric state. About
900 A.D., the art of the Sung
dynasty began to ﬁlter into Japan.
From this art, Japanese painters
evolved their even more delicate
landscapes and ﬁgure studies.

DESIGN ALL-IMPORTANT

In the nineteenth century, prints
of these works reached France and
England, where they were eager-
ly seized by Whistler, Manet,
Burne-Jones, and other leading
artists. Modern painters and

Bureau Needed
Says Hovde

“There should be established a
Bureau of City Physicians, with a
thoroughly competent physician
at its head who has executive
ability enough to reorganize the
work of the city physicians and
imagination enough to lead the
further development of his bur-
eau,” says Dr. B. J. Hovde, pro-
fessor of history at the University
and director of the Department of
Public Welfare.

In‘ an article ‘published in
Pittsburgh’s Health magazine is-
sued by the Department of Pub-
lic Health, Dr. Hovde comments
on “The Health Problems in Pub-
lic Wefare,” advocates an ampli-
ﬁcation and reorganization of the
group of city physicians who care

details. For example, notice how
the Sung artist approaches the
painting of a dog. He fully un-
derstands the anatomy of the ani-
mal, but you have never seen the
kind of dog he draws. His dog
will never move or bark. Instead
the dog is just an integral part of
a pattern that he is incorporating
into the picture, and the ﬁnished
picture is merely meant to be a
beautiful design.

Like the Greek, the Sung artist
likes everything to be orderly and
in its place, with nothing done to
excess. An unidentiﬁed artist of
the period states, “A great moun-
tain is so stately that it becomes
the master of multitudinous others
arranged about it in order.”

Alsoﬂto the eight paintings on
silk, which are originals, there
are reproductions of the scrolls,
which, as they unroll, tell the story
of some legendary myth or fairy
tale. In addition, a fresco detail
from the Ming dynasty, lent by
Walter Hovey, head of the ﬁne
arts department, is included in the
show.

for the needy.

Present personnel of this group
is eleven doctors, and the facilities
for medical service are limited.
The acute situation created by un-
employment has left the city
aware “that it fails dismally to
fulﬁll the community’s obligations
toward itself and its least fortun-
ate members,“ Dr. Hovde declares
in this article.
