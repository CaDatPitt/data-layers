Moore has worked for the last

When he was inaugurated more
than a year ago, Larry Platt had
high hopes for his Student
Government Board (SGB) presi-
dency and even higher hopes for
uniting the student body behind
what had too long been a passive
governing body. '

' “If.I were a student looking at
myself, the Board and the situation
around me now, I'd say, nothing
was any-different,’ Platt comment-
ed early this”week._

Interviewed Monday, Platt ad-
mitted his attempts to lift student
awareness and concern were for
the most part unsuccessful, but he
believes he and the Board made

many important, if unspectacular,_

advances.

“Much of what Student Govern-
ment doesis just trying to keep,

what we have. And no one hears
about that sort of stuff.”

Students, Unioniza’rionS’rudied~g

BY BILL MOORE I A

ANN ARBOR, Mich.—Stu-
dents, faculty members and admin-
istrators convened here over _the
weekend to discuss the student’s
role in the traditionally two-party
collective bargaining process as it
applies to faculty unionization.

The three-day conference spon-
sored .by the Research Project on
Students and Collective Bargain-
ing (RPSCB) addressed the various
issues surrounding th. role of
students in collective bargaining
and various steps students have
taken on presently unionizing
campuses.

Central Michigan University
Provost Neil Bucklew termed
faculty unionization a head-on
collision between two strong
traditions—the belief by faculty
that they are professionals, and not

the blue-collar workers usually_

associated with unions and the
bipartite system ,of
collective bargaining, leaving no
room for third-party irfvolvement.

“When these two distinct‘-

traditions meet, it will mean many
changes in both,” Bucklew told the

-audience of about 150 from

campuses across the country.
He said students‘ were a large

.part of the ‘reason faculty are

has shown student power in

‘academic areas, robbing the faculty .,
of power that was once exclusively -

theirs, ” Bucklew explained.

He cautioned the "students that
those involved in collective bar-
gaining “will not’ gracefully accept

third-party involvement . ’ ’

The conference, held on" the
University of Michigan campus,
was attended by Pitt’s Student
Government Board (SGB) Presi-
dent Barry Weisband, Graduate
and/Professional Student Associa-
tion President Sandy DeBourlando,

School of General Studies Cabinet. »

presidential candidate Wayne
Romanowski, SGB advisor Nancy
Evans and Bill Lenaghen, assistant
to the director of Affirmative
Action.

The conference included numer-
ous workshops and skill sessions
dealing with actions students can
take to insure a voice in the
bargaining process.

Kathleen Brouder, associate
director of the RPSCB, said student
options ranged from attempts to
encourage faculty to vote down
unionization, a tactic successfully
employed at the University of
Toledo, Ohio, to unionization‘ of the

student body, now developing at
the University of Massachusetts. .

The mandatory $50 matriculation fee, refundable upon .

graduation, and paid by incoming students has been
questioned by several students recently. '
The students were interested in how the money is
invested throughout their four-year stay and how they can
secure the refund. '
Student Accounts Manager James Beavers said the fee
reserves a spot in the students’ class before he attends Pitt.
“Most universities have such a fee for students,” Beavers

Beavers explained ‘such damage payments are standard

Frank T. Cendar, Assistant Student Accounts ‘Manager,’

said his ‘office is processing last fall’s ‘matriculation fee

“We have to match up matriculation fees individually to '

“This has to be done
because not all students pay the fee.’?

He pointed out that School of General Studies, graduate

mood, not much of anything was
accomplished.”

He is happy with his work in‘

cutting red tape in such offices as
Student Accounts, in securing
money for the student emergency-’»
loan fund and in beginning to form
an effective student-teacher evalu-
ation mechanism, together with
other small successes, few noticed.
“I think the groundwork has
been laid for a lot of things,” he
said.. «
He ran for SGB president in the
first place because, he said, “I got
caught up in the bug of

consumerism.” Platt was bit by the-

bug while working in Washington,
D.C., with Ralph Nader’s consum-
er advocates. He returned to the
Pitt campus for winter term of last
year, less than one month before
“I was really
interested in consumerism, and I
really thought there were certain
issues where the Student Govern-
'ment could have an impact.’’.

The years ahead will see even"

more consumer issues facing
Student Government and students,

Platt predicted, and he is optimistic 4

     7 T     

that the new student leaders will be
ready. ‘ ,

“This year we saw an attempt to
charge for football tickets. Who’s
to say that won't be applied to
library books. They are going to
start charging for everything.”

The best advice Platt could offer
from his experience was that the
SGB should stop trying to go at it
alone. He said there are strong,
dedicated leaders in most major
student groups, not just in the‘

- SGB, and he encouraged attempts

for the different interests to work
together.

“The school is in a ﬁnancial
crunch, and they will try to save
money in ways that‘are the least

"70 Years of Collegiate Jogrnplism at the University of Pittsburgh”

- , New Attitude Needed

_ Some of the talk at last Thursday’s Student Affairs Advisory Council
(SAAC) meeting centered on» the important and often long-winded
question of student input in administrative decisions.

One way or another, the issue manages to surface at SAAC meetings

' and in the daily confrontations between students and administrators

/.

over ongoing University issues.‘

«While some observers may not understand the constant surfacing of
the student input question and may even liken its proliferation to the
beating of a dead dog, student leaders who constantly raise the point

i_ obviously feel differently,

It’s a favorite reply of Pitt officials-to say students have seats on.
SAAC and the standing committees of the University Senate, but
students could hold all the seats on these committees and still not make

. a bit of difference in University governance.

What matters more to students and their elected leaders is an

attitude of welcome cooperation on the part of the administration.

The idea in years past of seating a student on the traditionally _

administrative committees was not an end in itself, but rather a means

-A   prove to University ofﬁcials that students were responsible and
‘/ ' competent enough to play an effective role in managing the affairs of

their own campus. .
What was expected to follow, was an era of accommodation when

I relations would not be give-and-take but hand-in-hand. Instead the

calls for increased student input go on. «
If administrators would seek student opinions before the die is
already cast, as Resident Student Association Chairman Marty
J Doerﬂer said was the case with. the new housing contract, student
concerns would not be seen as adversary ones.
" A working relationship from the start would ensure a positive
reconciliation of, ideas rather than the us vs. them haggling that’s
characteristic of adrninistratonstudent negotiations now.
I And not only would it lead to better solutions, it would also 

l ’ mutual aggravations.

 A Boardseat Empty,

The line of duty sometimes requires that one know when to
relinquish that duty to someone else. .

Citing personal family reasons that will require the next two months
of her time, Student Government Board (SGB) member Sue Turner
resigned two days after her inauguration last week. Rather than give a
half-hearted effort to her new role, Turner felt it was in the interest of
the Board for her to step down. For this_insight, we commend her.

On the ot-herhand, her timing is thought to be suspiciously off and it
very well could be part of a political power play._ \

It’s common lmowledge in Student Government circles that Turner‘
was set on resigning at least two days before the inauguration.

Had Turner resigned before the inauguration, her seat would’ve

- been filled by the next highest vote-getter in the Board e1ection—in
‘ this case, Cliff Protzman. But when a member resigns after being
ofﬁcially sworn in, the vacant seat must be ﬁlled by a person chosen by
the other Board members. I"

That Tumer chose to resign a mere two days after being inaugurated
casts a shadow over the new Board. Because of this, we anxiously
await" the Board’s selection of a new member.

' The only way to dispel this shadowis for the Board to recognize the-
seriousness of the situation and take the proper steps to alleviate it-b
awarding the vacant seat to Cliff Protzman. - '

Recently, another in a long line

of shallow, derogatory and slan-
derous articles about black frats

and sororities appeared in The Pitt

News. This article is ,for those
‘authors and people who are willing

to take off their dark glasses of

ignorance and let the light of truth

shine through their minds, thereby.

enlightening themselves on the
subject of black fraternities and
sororities. First of all, let me pdint
out that our membership is open to
everyone!
not,‘ we do have white members.
Shocks you, doesn’t it?

There are those who are quick to

point out that the main function of

black frats and sororities is to party
and that nothing’ constructive such
as University projects is under-
taken or done. I would like at this
time to make apoligies for

—Zeta Phi Beta sorority and its. _

prenatal care program for unwed
mothers, which is not only local but
also nationwide.

- —-Omega Psi Phi fraternity and
its idea of handing out booklets
containing information on the
detection and treatment of VD.
Because, let's face it,.VD is now at
epidemic proportions.

——Delta Silgma Theta ‘sorority
and its many contributions to
UNICEF. . .. ,

-—-—Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority

and the work it's been doing for ‘

years at Shuman Center in

Pittsburgh.

—Kappa Alpha Psi and its food

drive for the underprivileged
families of the Hill District.

its work with the Pittsburgh

Because, believe it or

community projects more often,
but then again, our reasons for
doing them are not for bragga-
docio. . -

Ah! And then there is our
pledge program with its so-called
conjured-up initiations and de-
grading rituals. You read.that
pledges are seen running around
with—uh, what was that again?
Oh, yeah———the millstones,
scribed by their pledge groups,
around their necks. Whether they
be blue and white crescents,
golden sphinxes or red and white
bows, they are not thevburdens ‘you
make them out‘ to be, but merely
symbols of what that pledge is
trying to achieve—a form of self-
expression, if you please, for the
pledge and his big brothers and
sisters. There‘ is .also a deeper

purpose in making the pledge run -

an errand than what appears on the
surface.

If one thinks the black Greeks
can conjure up some peculiar

rituals, then you should have read.

the one concocted bv the author of

' Fridayfs article in The Pitt News. It

tells of a lone pledge standing in
the main lobby - in a white,
Klansman-like robe while holding a
brick.

The pledge of which my friend

spoke happened to be pledging my V

fraternity (Phi ;Beta Sigma). In
reality, the robe was not white, but
royal _blue with white’ trimming,
and unlike the Klansman, he was
not marked. My brothers and I sat
and stood around him not for
sadistic kicks, bi1t~to make sure he
was as comfortable as possible. If
the pledge felt he couldn’t stand or
kneel‘ for the time prescribed-, he
immediately would have been
taken out of the lobby.‘ Concerning
the line of pledges with the blue
and white crescent symbols of my
fraternity who came traipsing in
during the lobby ceremony to hail
us in semi-unison, I know nothing
of this because there weren't any

BEHIND THE LINES

I

Now that he is out of office, many

call the Platt year a failure; Platt.

himself, while stressing that much
was done to lay the groundwork for
future SGBs, is less than pleased
with much he and his Board
accomplished.

Platt is a pragmatist. He talks
about isolating issuesand about
research-oriented government—,
terms his predecessors wouldn't
have understood. A

But he too,was caught up in that
bug about which he talks—the bug
of consumer change and research-
oriented advocacy. And he forgot
the basic lesson of his approach.

Change. unless you burn banks ,

and bomb buildings. is a slow
process. It takes more than a year.
two years. or four years. But Platt
and those around him were looking
for immediate results. and they
never came. Now, he isn't sure how
cffcctivcihc was. and people in
Student Government speak of him
as if he were a fallen messiah.
But the truth is. change is
coming. All of us probably will
graduate bcforc it comes to full
bloom, but the roots are well-
pluntcd. - _
Platt turned around the mood
and modes of Student Government.
No longer does SGB wait for issues

and controversies and_run to The _
 Pitt Ncwsto complain __and‘ eagerly

others pledging under us except for

 

$5-

the one so wrongly described. -1.,‘ 

This lone’ pledge stood in the
lobby withthe fraternity’s para-
phernalia around him not as a lamb
to be sacrificed, but because we

wanted the people to see the

beauty of our brotherhood, that we
were proud to have this man as our
brother. He had earned his right to
be a Sigma—something we both

wanted and something a small .

mind wouldn’t understand.

It's a pity someone shouldn't or
wouldn't beliey,e, this I because
nothing is nearer to the truth.
People are exposed to a portion of
our pledlge program only becau
underlying circumstances
allow us to have a house where you
wouldn’t have to see it. Besides,
we have nothing to hide anyway.

Our whole‘ pledge‘ program is
based on the simple truth that the
fraternity or sorority to ‘which a
person wants him as a member just
as much as the pledge wants to be
one. From the outset, it becomes a
learning’ experience for both
parties.

This learning experience consists
of the big brothers.and sisters and
pledges getting into each other so
much that they become a part, of
each other or as one.

Because of the inevitable, the
learning experience transcends

itself to love. The term love he1'g§§
not used in a sentimental sense,"

but as good will, acceptance and
esteem. ‘ ‘

As one can readily see, there is
no slave-master relationship here,
as one author_had the audacity to

suggest. There is no record of a 5

person pledging a black fraternity
or sorority being blinded because
he learned how to read, nor is there
any record of a slave having the
choice of “dropping line.”

Mcrril Hutlsonis a brother of Phi
Beta Sigma fraternity.

Platt, and those who worked with

him and now hold the reins of
>13-0We.1's

stopped and thought
before they acted, and showed the
administration that it no longer
could pull.wool over anyone's eyes.
The administrators still have the
power and do mostly what they
want, but nowthey know the

sgstudents know -they are doing it.

Platt’s real accomplishment this
past year can be summed up in his

one major theme—consumeri - "f_l,'

Students had forgotten somewher
along the line that they are paying
for a product, and when the
product doesn't meet expectations,
they have a legitimate right to
gripe. And gripe Platt did. He has
made sure that in years to come
students will have a voice again in
what is done. , , ‘
Perhaps the best evidence of

’Platt's worth is the enemies he

made. Manyin the Cathedral's
administrative offices don’t like
him. "The reason, whether they
know it or not, is simple.

Now, thanks to people like Platt,
they are beginning to realize they
no longer can‘ dictate to students
while patting them on the heads
and assuring them it was joint

As a tenured full "professor in

/,FAS and a member of the AAUP

for 15 years, I am alarmed by the
various statements published by

j the Teachers for an Independent

Faculty (TIF). lrespect many of the
individuals representing TIF, I
know they have the best interests
of the University at heart, and I
agree with some of their senti-
ments. But I fear the effect the TIF
statements may have on colleagues
making up‘ their minds how to vote
on the March 9-10 elections.
There are two basic reasons why
I believe Pitt requires a legally
constituted bargaining agent at this
‘time. Less important, but still

sities. In three years, faculty
salaries are rising at the state
:olle es (with a NSEA contract) by‘
a we l-‘deserved 50 ‘V0; at Temple
University (with an AAUP contract)

' by 30 ‘V0 or 10% a year; and at Pitt
‘ (with no contract) by about 17% .

Harrisburg education budgets re-
sult from political processes, and
the total dollar appropriation is
irrational in relation to the actual
needs of the three state-related
schools. When a university has a
contractual obligation for incre-
ments, as Temple does, this is
,“taken off the top” as it were, so
that institutions without a contract,
like Pitt, simply take their lesser
shares of what remains. Temple's
is a good contract, in this
regard, since it provides for regular
increments to meet cost-of-living

 
    

    

Salaries

increases, funds for the correction-
of-salary inequities, and minima
(not maxima) for salaries at the
various faculty ran-ks. With Temple
organized, in brief, Pitt must do so
in self defense." ’
Second, Pitt requires in the
future what it has not had in the
past: an active tradition of faculty
self-governance. Through powers
delegated by the Trustees, the
administration in fact runs the
University. At least in FAS, where I
teach, the small units at the
bottom (the departments) send
their problems‘ trickling “up” to
the administration‘ while, the
administration's decisions are sent
“down" with’ greater rigor and

‘finalty. Nowhere—least of all in the

“Divide and conquer" is a
description, fair or not, of how FAS

‘faculty perceive their areas to be

run. Thus I am impressed with the
Temple University contract negoti-
ated—now with great effort and
good will on both sides— between
the AAUP agent and the univer-
sity. On the single issue of tenure,
for example, the contract states
that the authority for granting
tenure is shared between the
Trustees and administration on the
one hand and the Temple faculty on
the other. This is an authority in
which Pitt faculty must share if we
are to be a self-governing faculty,
andlit is an authority which TIF
would not be able to achieve——even'
were it interested in doing so. For
TIF supporters seem basically
satisfied with a dangerous status
quo.

Given these views, my concern

with the TIF initiative is obvious.’

Now that the 1976-77 Student
Government Board ‘has been
inaugurated, The Pitt News deci-
ded to take a look at what some
former Board members who are

A still hanging around campus had to

say about the experience of serving
on Student Government and where
they feel the organization has been
successful and where it failed in the
past.

Although it has been a year since
the conclusion of their term of

' office, Pat Kablach, Bruce Keeler

and Paul Hertneky still remember
their experiences on the’ 1974-75
Board. Without exception, they

-felt the experience was worthwhile,

Kablach, now at Pitt Law School,
termed the experience an eye-
opener. ‘ ‘I really got to see the way

Kablach added that working on the
Board inﬂuenced her decision to
attend law school. H

Keeler and Kertneky said they-
felt they gained a knowledge of
politics applicable to other experi-
ences. Both said they had
approached the year naively
expecting sincerity from the
adminstrators. ,“The administra-
tors,don’t take Student Govern-
ment seriously enough,” Keeler
said. I .

Hertneky added, “There are so
many things that aren’t what
they’re laid out to be in the
University handbooks.” He said
he learned to approach politics and
bureaucracies more discriminately.

“I’ve discovered what to accept or

reject of University policy and-

politics.”

In evaluating the performance of
his board, Keeler felt that given the
circumstances, it did a good job.
“Everyone-expects 100% effective-
ness,” he said, “but 20% might be
good——it’s all relative to how other
boards work.”

Kablach said some members of
the board “really tried hard, “but
were limited in effectiveness. .
“Student Government exists for
the University administrators to

board,Aaccording to Hertneky can
be evaluated only in individual
terms. “For some people and
some issues, it may be called
effective. For some others, it
wasn’t.”

Keeler summed up the issue:
“Everyone expects you to do
something major. Student
Government will never be able to
hold down tuition or get a new
Student Union—something like
new bicycle racks would be more
realistic.”

The Public Parking‘ Authority,

 "  CrimeWave:,Beating The Meters  

At the height of the epidemic,
there were tens of thousands of
slugs. It became senseless to
attempt an investigation, so the
bank would destroy them. Along
with the washers, there were bingo
chips and even popsicle sticks.

About a year ago, possibly as a
result of pressure from law
enforcement, the washer manufac-
turers began ma'chining their
washers‘ a few hundredths of an
inch thicker. This did not affect the
washers if used in an automobile,
but it did make them too thick to ﬁt
the slots on the meters. Overnight,
the use of slugs plummeted, and

. the grumbling commuters began

digging ‘for the real stuff.

Many new meters have been
installed since the great ' slug
epidemic. Manufactured by
Rockwell International and Duncan
Miller, these new meters have an
added feature, the slug ‘detector.
This device is operated by pins that
automatically jam the mechanism if

, a washer is used.

The City Parking Meter Depart-
ment, which_controls the Schenley
Plaza and Oakland meters, could
not be reached for comment, but a
repairman in the midst of’ dissect-
ing a jammed meter did offer his
views.

“I must ﬁx 100 of these a day,"

»he said. “That’s.all I do for 40
hours a week. . _

“Slugs aren’t that big a problem
anymore. Now it’s ring tops from
beer cans. Most people just throw
‘em in and jam the meter, but if
you clip theprongs and use a penny
in the nickel slot for weight, you

E can get time.”

Start drinking, commuters.

The conference will be in the
Student. Union, and all events are
open to the public. ‘

Ticket Costs

  Are Soaring

  Nationwide  

BY LOUISE COOK
Associated Press Writer

From "symphonies to Shake-
speare, the cost of culture is going
up.

An Associated Press survey
shows that ticket prices for plays,
concerts and other performances
have risen by 10 to 20 per cent in
the past year.

But ofﬁéials say the higher prices
don’t cover steadily growing 
production costs. They are““~:-73-’
searching for additional money
from foundations, community don-

ations and local government.

The Lyric Opera of Chicago, with _
20,000 subscribers, boosted prices
for the 1976 season by about 10 per
certt. The _n_ew range is $6.50 to
$23.50, up from $5.75 to $21.50.

Donald Britton, the. opera’s
business manager, said ticket sales
don_’t cover costs. The opera needs
a $65,000 subsidy every time the
curtain goes ‘up, he said.- - i V

The Lyric reduced the number of
productions from eight‘to seven
last season in an effort to save
money. “Every year it becomes
more difﬁcult to get funds,” said
Britton. “Moneyvin the past couple  ,
of years has become tighter.” ‘ ”

-Britton said the opera has tried
to enlarge _its base of support ’ ,
because I “big contributors are

.disappearing from the scene.” He

said contributions from" govern-'

‘ment sources "were “a drop in the

bucket.’:’ ‘ _

Ticket sales cover only 52 per
cent of costs for the; Indiana
Repertory Theater, which raised
prices last July. [Foundations and
government grants pay 28.per cent
of the bill. The rest comes from
community donations.

Camille Fife, public relations _
director for the nonproﬁt regional"VE,;~f‘T
theater, said_the group is trying to
keep prices down, but is ﬁnding it
increasingly difﬁcult. The latest
boost—_$2 on subscriptions-
brought the cost for six plays to a
maximum of $26.

The top price at the Shubert
Theater "in Los Angeles, which
features touring productions of
Broadway hits, is $15, up $2.50.

The Man Behind AWheel   

BY STEVE SYBERT

Jud Hilliard sits in his bus
outside Benedum Hall and finishes
his lunch. After eating a sandwich,
he throws away the cellophane
wrapper and returns to his seat
behind the steering wheel. He lets
in several people, lights a

cigarette, then puts the bus in gear ‘

and proceeds down O’Hara Street
to pick _up his next load of students..

Hilliard is the campus bus
driver. He is familiar to all the
people he has taken up to Trees

Hall during his seven years on the 

job, as well as those he has left
behind. But nobody really knows
who he is—he's just the bus driver.

Formerly a driver of semi’s and
tractor-‘trailer rigs, Hilliard, mar-
ried and the fatheriof two children,
is not a University employee, but
works for J .W. Schmidt-t Inc. which
holds the contract with Pitt for the
busing of sports teams and the
band. as well as students.

“It’s basically a good job,” he
says, driving down Bigelow Boule-

- vard. “There are no fares to worry

about and I get the same breaks as

the students do. I also drive any'

charter coming out of the Univer-
sity."

Hilliard is 29 years old. He is a
big man with a soft voice. His wavy
hair and long sideburns give him a
Roy Clark look but he clearly
possesses much‘more strength.

“I had a couple of students who
wanted to take a swing at me
once," he said, “but they never
did." It was a wise decision;

Using his massive arms, Hilliard
turns right onto Tennyson and
stops to pick up a passenger. He
continues down the street and is
faced with a tight squeeze between
a parked and an oncoming car on
the narrow street. But Hilliard is
used to these tight squeezes. I-_Ie
glances several times in his
mirrors, then coolly drives through
the. opening. ,

“The whole trip' is long enough
to keep from becoming monoton-
nus,” he says, taking a puff from
his cigarette. “Plus I know just
about everybody. I follow all the
Pitt sports pretty well—basketball,
football, track, hockey—'and I know
these guys when they get on the
bus."

Hilliard turns right again onto
Fifth Ave., lafter letting several
more students aboard. He stops for
a car trying to back into a parking

‘ space. Hilliard waits impatiently,

then makes his way to the main

stop at the corner of Fifth and
Bigelow. Here the bus empties,
then quickly reﬁlls. .
“Sometimes I have to leave
when there are still kids standing
here." he says, “But it can't be
helped. There are certain periods
when’ the bus’ gets crowded and
students endup walking. We need
two buses. but that's up to the
University." I , :
This time, however, no one is left
behind. The last student squeezes
on and Hilliard starts up Bigelow.
He only goes several feet, then

’stops the bus. A straggler appears

at the door and Hilliard lets him in.
He is pretty nice about stopping for
a student needing a lift.

“The problem is a lot of kids
don’t know where the stops are.”

" he says, dropping a cigarette to his

feet and crushing it. “I will stop if I
can do it safely or if 'there’s no one
tailgating». These buses don’t stop
on a dime you know and when
you're going 25 miles per hour,
somebody might fall if I stop. But I
will stop if] can.”

Hilliard starts up Bigelow again,
stopping at the "light past Bayard.
Here he lights another cigarette
and pulls down his sun shield. He
turns ontogBellef1eld and experi-
ences another tight squeeze, but

Hertneky lost to Platt in last year’s
presidential election.

“As long as you have someone in

work, they can do ‘a good job,”
Keeler said. Hertneky rated the
effectiveness of the 1975-76 board
as “about the same as us,” though
Kablach found Platt’s board to be
“more organized, more efficient”

than the 1974-75 Board.

impact was zero.” He also said
Student Government’ shouldn’t
have wasted so much time “with

All three former board members
offered advice for the newly
inaugurated board. ' .

Kablach stressed the need to
utilize the sum‘mer months. “It’s
the best time to >- be working,

Another suggestion came from
Kablach’s. own encounters. I
should have been less tactful;
you've got to be direct,” she said,
admitting that it was difficult in a
volunteer organization. '

The new Student Government
must “establish a power base with
the administrators, showing them-

selves as representatives of the‘

student body,” according to
Hertneky. “Student Government
«can't continue to be laughed at,
and Platt showed that the students
must be reckoned with,-” he added.

As examples of the serious needs

of the students, Hernecky'mention- A

‘Hertneky was generally'pesrsi-

According to Keeler, the new
Board should work now to get
organized. “Every board sets
priorities. This Board has to set
priorities, define them and stick by
them.” ’

Keeler and Hertneky think it is
imperative for the students to work

BY TOM WASELESKI

There’s an obvious difference
between a popular following and a
,eult. Few rock giants emerged

’ from the blazing,60s with their

music or their hordes intact.
Among the select inner core are
Bob Dylan, Paul Simon, maybe
Mick Jagger, perhaps acouple of

—.Beatles and of course Saturday

night's Civic Arena artist, ‘ Joni
Mitchell. ,

/She hit the stage in tight black
pants, a’ high-cut black jacket,
scarlet blouse and a wide-brimmed
black hat showing no hair, looking
more like someone who was ready
to perform a ﬂamenco than sing
songs from Blue. _

- Following a good, hearty set by
her main backup, L.A. Express,
"Mitchell picked up a guitar amid
the tumult of the crowd; it was her
they came to see.

V Upening with probably the most
desired number in the collective
mind of the audience, she
strummed her way through a looser
version of “Help Me."

‘Not much later she played the

' . song's stylistic counterpart from

the album Court and Spaljt, “Free

Man in Paris," doing a better job
here on both rhythm and voice.
Her acoustic prowess was front
and center as the backup Express
sat out “Shades of Scarlet

Conquering” from the new Hissing
It’s

of Summer Lawns album.

songs like this that allow Mitchell‘ .

to show off her melodic subtlety as
a composer—you know—less is
more and all that. There were a
couple of seemingly feminist
cheers at the end of the song when
Mitchell emphasized “... a woman
must have everything!”

But it was already five songs into
the show and some of the crowd
had not had what they wanted—the
streaming, dancing yellow flow of
Mitchell’s hair. After some
scattered calls, one finally broke
through, and Mitchell ‘agreeably
tossed the hat off, her blond strings
falling on her shoulders as the mad
plaudits careened off the dark
Arena dome. '

Throughout the show Mitchell
was as personal as her poignant
lyrics, and her faithful fans (at least

those who could sneak by the"

guards) set flowers and candy in
heart-shaped boxes at her feet on
center-stage. j V

“Shadows and Light," which
was recorded like a cappella
Gregorian chant, was played in a
terribly refreshing way, with the

‘instruments being laid on one by

one—the acoustic guitar, the bass,

  Kubrick Movie Artistic Hit

BY M, C, PILECKI novel. The title character of the
story is a simple opportunist, not
malevolent in the least, but simply,
a little‘ guy trying to make itbig in
the world. His actions which
Thackeray's audience undoubtedly
disapproved of don't even rate a
shrug in 1976. . 
The effect is not unlike that of
Peter Bogdanovich’s great bomb,
Daisy Miller. The photography‘
was lush, but the story inane. '
But it’s really unfair to Barry
Lyndon and to director/ writer/ pro-
ducer Stanley Kubrick to compare
the two -movies very closely.
Lyndon is not a complete bomb, In
spite of the storyline, it’s not really
boring to watch. In fact, it’s very
easy.to just forget the ridiculous
plot and gaze at the stunning
visuals Kubrick has repared.

On that score, Kubrick has really; ,
outdone himself. Barry Lyndon is a ; ‘
beautiful movie, and the art"
museum analogy ‘really holds". 
Some scenes give the appearance‘ 
of light watercolors, others are oils
in the manner of the Old Masters, _'
still others‘ bring to mind‘ Monet‘ 
and Renoir. L T

‘Kubrick has done more than '
worked with color, stock. He,‘ has

successfully brought film to a par. .
with the other visual arts in th_e'use'  '
of color, light, and even texture’, _

visual art. So, if one considers the 
movie on that ‘level alone, as an
interpretation ‘of ‘Tpure cinema,”
Barry Lyndon is a _success'inde_ed;~'

It's happened before. A

Birth of a Nation, and millions of_

And are disappointed. What
happens then is a complete
reversal of the earlier praise, and
the film is tagged a bomb.

Barry Lyndon is a breathtakingly

known heights visually, but dram-
atically, it’s a real washout.

Kubrick seems to have "sensed
this, in choosing to dwell on his
visuals with langorous backtrack-
ing while giving a sumptuous feast
to the eyes. It may sound odd,,:_but
the three-hour-plus movie would
have been more boring indeed if
Kubrick had gone through his
stunning visuals more quickly to try
to speed..up_the plot. Arun through
_an art museum, without giving one
time to enjoy the pictures, is much

- more tedious than if one takes the

‘time to “get into” the art objects.
A Now for the story. Redmond
Barry, a fairly wooden character
fairly woodenly acted by Ryan
O’Neal, is a’ poor gentleman in

_ Ireland in the mid-18th century.

He learns ‘early about opportunism
when the cousin he loves becomes
betrothed to a wealthy Englishman
so her father can get out of debt.
Barry challenges the ﬁance to a
duel, and, when he thinks he's
killed him, rides off to duck the
police. '

While hiding out, his money is

‘stolen, so he joinsthe army for

quick anonymity and money. He
ﬁnds. instead, the stupidity of war
and, after a friend dies in his arms,
wisely decides to leave: It’s illegal,
and shocking for Victorians, but
quite understandable to most of the
post-Vietnam generation.

He's not entirely successful of
course, and ends up in the’ even
more brutal Prussian Army, and
becomes a hero by a fluke. But
then, all ‘heroes become such by
tlukes: Still, he’s a virtual prisoner
of the Prussian ofﬁcers, and when
set to spy upon a countryman, he
turns “Traitor” to his captors and
gets out of the country. With his

reaches. heretofore un-'

 

. A
new partner he becomes aiiﬂ

gambler, and looks to make a
financially advantageous match.

So he ‘marries a wealthy widow,

lady Lyndon, and takes the name
of her late husband. He constantly
quarrels with his stepson, cheats
on his wife, and tries to be a good
father to his own son. So far he
sounds like a typical suburban
father. T '

But after about nine or ten years
of rich, if not marital, bliss, the tide
turns on Barry, ‘and he ends up
with only his mother and a most
generous t50O annuity, and banish-
ed from England. ,-.

The Victorian ‘.‘moral" of the ‘-
story is that Barry never achieved
true happiness through his oppor-
tunistic ways. Of course, he did
lead a most interesting life. True,
the lows were much‘ worse than
most people encounter, but then,

thing haunting, ﬂuid and so
exotically sexy that many must
have regretted the album version.

While concentrating on material
from her last two LPs, Mitchell
went a bit further and did three yet
to-be recorded tunes: “Coyote,” a
number with strong congas, “Don
Juan's Reckless Daughter," jazzy,

with full Express backup and a,

song about a recent experience on
Beale Street, Memphis.

After two dozen numbers, the

natives weren’t so restless as they

. were benumbed, and as a finish,

Mitchell belted out “Raised on
Robbery,” which did plenty to shift
the dead weight in the seats. In
probably the best song of the night,
her voice was like a nervous
bowstring turned loose on an
electric violin; just when it seemed
her energy had peaked, the Congas
and acoustic drums blammed into-a
deafening, warpath-stomping
“Jungle Line"—the tight-skinned
thunder never letting up till the
whole piece was over.

A relentless ovation produced
the easy, ﬁnger-snapping “Twist-
ed." one of Mitchell’s typically
humorous pieces in an encore that
brought artist and devotee even
closer than the few feet that
separated them. '

So what we have is a story of ‘a
guy who simply tries to operate in
the best way with the least
resistance. He’s no saint, but then,
he's not the devil one is used to
from modern “anti-heroes."

There's nothing much surprising in
the story, and nothing of particular
excitement.

Time Changes Dylan

BY GEORGE FAINES

Dylan is like a reﬂection of this
country and all its ups and downs.
He changes, just as the times do.
Desire ﬁnds Dylan returning to his
protest songs (“Hurricane”) and
stories (“Joey”). The lyrics are
very moving and poetic, while the
music concentrates on melody.

Dylan’s backup band performs
very well. Emmy Lou Harris’
backing vocals blend nicely with
Dylan’s voice and Scarlet Rivera's
violin-playing is excellent. _

“Hurricane” is Dylan’s testi-
mony to the controversial case of
Rubin “Hurricane” Carter, a boxer
convicted of a murder he may never
have committed. It’s a very
moving song that has strong
attacks on racism and justice:
“Shame! to live in a land where

_justice is a game!”

- “Oh: Sister” is. a very touching

i J

ballad that has Dylan seeking the
affection he feels that everyone
must get from life: “Time is an
ocean but it ends atlthe shore. You

A may not see me tomorrow.” .
‘ ‘Joey’ ’ is the tragic story of Joey

Gallo, the Brooklyn gangster.
Dylan is at his best here, singing
about “what it's like to be in
society with a shackle on your
hands.” Even a gangster can love.

The album ends with “Sara,” a
beautiful ballad about Dylan’s
wife. “Sara” brings out the tender,
feelings and inner secrets of‘
Dylan’s soul. He describes his wife
as “so easy to look at, so hard to
deﬁnef’

Desire is a-very personal album.

A Gamecocks Outshoot e

Panthers, 79-72 A

BY TOM HALL
__ Sports Editor

The‘ South Carolina Gamecocks
have proven ‘all year long, to

ii A .. __opponent after opponent, that they

are an extremely efﬁcient offensive
basketball team. What the diehard
Panther fans came to see last
Saturday evening was how this
offensive prowness could stand up
under the relentless pressure of the
“amoeba.” , A ‘

_ South Carolina’s 79-72 win can
tell only part of the story. The
interesting feature of the contest

’ ~ lies in the number of attempted
. ﬁeld goals. Pitt tossed up 79 shots,
»making a mere 30 for another

horrid performance. Their percen-
tage came out to about 38%. The
Gamecocks, on the other hand,
took only 45 shots and made 26 of
these, shooting an excellent 58%.

, . But there is more to offense than‘
 .» ‘ ﬁeld goals. South Carolina padded

the victory rather exquisitely,
canning 27-32 free throw attempts,
an 84% clip.

‘ And so the story goes, the
decision against eight wins. The
Gamecocks, after starting off
rather slowly, have come on to win
-eight straight games and raised
their record to 15-6.

' ,,_‘Fro_m_ the opening tip, the Cats

seemed to be in trouble offensively.
It took Pitt nearly‘ four minutes to
put some numbers on the board

, and after a few shots came close,

Larry Harris hit two free throws to
start the Panther attack. (Attack? If

“you could call it that.)

‘SC's Nate Davis, who paced the

A ‘Gamecocks with 23 points, almost

single handedly took care of the
Pitt amoeba. The theory is, that
the amoeba is virtually impene-

 

  

trable; Davis superceded that, by
hitting Z0-foot jumpers‘ from the
baseline with amazing consistency.

Of Davis’ 23, 18 of those points
‘were in the first half, enabling SC
to take a commanding .12-point lead
at the half.

With the scoreboard clock out to
lunch for the second half, Panther
fans could only hope that a late Pitt
rally would come in time. Behind
the sparkling play of substitutes
Terry Knight- and Tom Richards,
the Cats closed to within four
points, with time, presumably,

- running out.

_ The Gamecocks decided to put
. the hot Cats on ice and moved into
their four-corner. stall offense. The
Panthers were forced to foul to get
the ball, but you can’t make up
' ground fouling a team that missed
only ﬁve of 32 foul shots.

Once again, a heated Cat rally
fell short. But when a team shoots

38 percent from the ﬁeld, they can .

hardly expect to win. ”

’ ‘ Pitt was paced by Harris, who

mirrored the Panther effort. He
was 5-19 from the ﬁeld, -and with
seven free throws, totaled 17
points.

Knight, who played excellent
coming off the bench against West
Virginia, had another ﬁne evening.
The sophomore forward made 5 of
9'ﬁeld-goal attempts and ﬁnished
second in the-scoring column with
12.

Seemingly shaking off nagging
wrist and ankle injuries, Richards
had probably his ﬁnest offensive
performance of the season, hitting
on ﬁve of seven attempts.

Gamecocks Alex «F.nglish and

Mike Dunleavy complimented‘

Davis’ 23. point effort with’ 18
apiece for South Carolina.‘ .

What» could a small
college team have to compare to
the talents and resources of a major
university the likes of Pittsburgh? _

Well, for starters, they have a

star forward Greg Miller, the

competition might well give one the

The Pitt track team captured 13
of 14 possible first places on the
way to’ a 92-26‘/2 routing- of
Indiana, Pa. on Saturday before a
sparse crowd at the Field House.

The long-distance‘ runs were
dominated by Pitt runners—most
notably by Mel'Boyd. Boyd won
the mile run and _40iminutes later
returned to cop first place in the
two-mile.

The Panthers demonstrated their 4»

power in the mile, the 1,000- and
600-yard runs, and the 50-yard
high hurdles, by taking the first
three places in each event. Pitt
also scored easy victories in the
one- and two-mile relays. "
The high points of the field
events were Dan Goodyear’s return
to winning form in the high
jump——he cleared 6-8 for a first
palce—and Paul Ciotti’s 14-foot

jump in the pole vault—the best’

performance of his career.

“I've been having problems with
my takeoff,” Ciotti said-, “but-once
I perfect that, I know I can go
higher." ,

Dan Schuerle and Willie Walker
were easy ‘victors in the 50-yard
high hurdles and 50-yard dash

respectively. Both were also on the

Panthers Fall To Penn State,4-3

  

  Pitt Hockey

1 outings.

BY STEVE SYBERT

The Pitt Hockey Club and the
Penguins must like to share.

They share the Civic Arena.
They share the support of area
hockey fans. Right now the
Penguins have momentum and are
driving for second place in the
National Hockey League's Norris
Division. The Hockey Club is in a
tailspin. ‘

The Panthers had momentum
once. losing only one game of its
first seven contests, but lately have
found the ‘going tough and have

ropped four out of their last five

Granted, the team has been
playing tougher competition, but in
three of the most recent contests,
the Panthers were shelled and
never in the game. Several reasons
account for the team's recent

-slump.

The Hockey Club has been
playing without formal practices for
over a month. Yet when skating
sessions are held at North" Park,
only eight or nine players show.

The players themselves are also
to blame. It seems that several get
a bigger kick out of swinging at

,opponents instead of the puck.

Rick Vernon, the team's captain
has missed the last four games Pitt
has lost and several of the players
feel he is letting the team down.
Against Penn State on Sunday,
the Panthers were up against all
these adversities and more. Not
only was Vernon absent, so were
the coaches.‘ Coach Len Barcalow
was hampered by the ﬂu, while his
assistant, Bob Montgomery, was
also unable to make‘ the trip.
‘ Yet the team almost pulled out a
win, losing by a 4-3 margin after

leading by a goal with three
minutes remaining. With only 16
players and no coaches making the
trip to State College, the Panthers
struggled the entire game, facing a
whopping 56 shots while gathering
only 21. .
Goaltender Larry Newill was
once again the victim of a barrage
of shots, but felt the team should
have won nonetheless. '
“We should have won
game," he said. “Our offense
played pretty good. It wasn’t a
game where they stayed in our
zone and shot; it was a wide open
game. ’We had them the whole
way, but they came down the ice
and got four or five shots while
we'd go down and onlyget one."
' Though Penn State jumped out
to an early 1-0 lead, the Panthers

weren't intimidated. Curt Hetz,
the team's freshman sensation,
scored two goals a minute and a
half apart late in the period to give
Pitt the lead. _

The Nittany Lions tied the game
in the second period, but Pitt once
again took command with'Russ
Stump's goal with 38 seconds gone
in the ﬁnal frame. Then the lack of
players and conditioning took its
toll with Penn State tallying the
tying goal at the 12:30 mark and

the game-winner a minute later. '\

Gary Fries,added three assists

‘for the Panthers, but it was Penn

State that was doing all
shooting.

“It was a .really wide rink, like
North Park," Newill said. “Even
when.I was kicking shots into the
corners, they got the puck first and

the

sent it back to the blueline for “

another shot."
The Panthers record dropped-to
6-5-1 whilethe Nittany Lions raised

their mark to 9-2. _Pitt’s next game . ‘ if

The organization for “No Agent” (Teachers for
an Independent Faculty) would have the Univer-
sity community believethat faculty here are con-
tent. They raise unionization as aspectre in order
tofdisplay gross misconceptions about collective
bargaining. They allow, of course, that the Uni-

-» versity has problems, but they urge at besta wait-

and-see policy and at the very least a cynical and
nonchalant attitude to the difficulties confront-
ing faculty at the University of Pittsburgh. After
careful consideration for seven years,’ at least,
many conscientious and responsible facultyhave
come to the conclusion that we need collective
bargaining because faculty feel increasingly ex-
cluded from participation in the major decisions
affecting their professional careers. Collegiality
has become a meaningless word. Though com-.
mittees have proliferated, the feeling of making
substantial contributions‘ to the life of this uni-
versity has almost disappeared. Many find them-
selves increasingly powerless in the face of pres-
sures by the State Legislature, the federal gov-
ernment, and “private donors.” The Faculty
Senate has tried several times to revamp its gov-
ernance machinery——tolittle avail. F ‘
Some of our colleagues, however, are willing to
accept administrative bureaucracy, while tremb-
ling at the thought of an effective faculty organ-
ization. Yet these same people who equate un-

V ionization with bureaucracy have also complain-

ed themselves about existing bureaucracy. Col-

_ lective bargaining represents an active effort to

' confront the’ governance issue directly. It is a

move to regain the autonomy we have already

lost, to preserve the rights we still ‘have, and to ,

expand our decision-making powers.

The -organization_ fori“NoAgent”has also mis-
represented the relationship of collective bargain-
ing to economic issues. They argue that the pow-
er of the union is “merely economic” and could
not affect real issues like the library, for exam-
ple. Such threadbare logic obscures the real is--
sues. Greater economic control by the faculty
can only help exert pressure for positive change
in all areas of academic life. Furthermore, how
can economic issues be separated’ from other
matters touching the total well-being of individ-
uals and groups? ' .

~Clearly, collective bargaining does not speak
to the needs of some faculty who have joined the
organization for “No Agent.” But it does speak
to the majority of us who work at Pitt today.
For example, many faculty who have served this
institution well over the years now find them-
selves in their retirement confronting straitened
contributions to this University. This is also more

than a mere economic issue which involves the-

well-being of our colleagues. The assistant pro-
fessors, the last hired and the first fired, are in-
creasingly becoming an intinerant core of work-
ers, exploited by universities_in the glut market.
The union has not advocated tenure for every-
one, but it has sought‘ a uniform application’ of

»reasonable.,tenure criteria. This is not a mere.

economic issue. This too involves the well-being, -

of our colleagues.

Progress in the area of affirmative action has
also been slow. The activists in the organization
for “No Agent” have failed to mention this issue,
preferring to describe tenure and hiringdifficu|-
tiesfas part of “the steady-state circumstances of

_ late ’70’s.” We are not in a steady state. We are

in a static state! Retrenchment by attrition has

been the tacit policy of the last few years. Wom-_ -
en and minority groups will continue to be ex- v
cluded as long as things are allowed to remain in

the static state which is the “No Agent” position.
This too is not merely an economic issue. This
involves the well-being of our missing colleagues.

What does collective bargaining have to offer
those of us who do not find salary the only is-.
sue, who are not facing retirement, and who are
not excluded from the creative life of the intell

llectual community? It offers the possibility ofa’

able to provide. |\echo the sentiments of another
