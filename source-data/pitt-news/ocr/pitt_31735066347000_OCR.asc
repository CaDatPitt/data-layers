---Vol. 7l No. 4

Wednesday, September l5, l976

BY DEANNA LOUISE

Something old, something new
and something budgetary. That’s
what Chancellor Wesley Posvar
talked about in his report to the
Senate Council Monday afternoon
in the Babcock Room of the
Cathedral.

Posvar called a recent American
Sociological Association’s (ASA)
criticism of the way Pitt handled
the six-month-old Paul Nyden case
“inappropriate, outrageous and
unfounded.”

Earlier this month the Society
accused the University of denying
Nyden tenure because of his
political views and activities.

“Only a couple of hundred in a
membership of thousands attended
the ASA meeting and voted on the
resolution (which demanded Ny-
den’s reinstatement).

“I believe many members of the
association are embarrassed by the
statement,” Posvar said. Dr.
William D’Antonio, chairman of
the ASA’s committee on freedom.
said the vote in favor of the
resolution by 119 members present
at the New York caucus was not an
ofﬁcial endorsement of Nyden.

Posvar said Nyden has requested
the appointment of a Faculty of
Arts and Sciences panel to
determine of the sociology depart-
ment’s decision in his tenure
application was fair and impartial.

In an overview of the new
freshman class, Posvar reported

Socialist Labor Hopeful
  Pushes American Change

BY DEANNA LOUISE

Socialist Labor Party vice presi-
dential hopeful Connie Blomen
called for America's immediate
change from capitalism to indus-
trial socialism during an interview
yesterday afternoon following her
address to students from the
Collective for Alternative Educa-
tion.

Blomen's platform, based on
industrial socialism, advocates a
society without political govern-
ment. class strata, unemployment
and the American wage system.

If the Socialist Labor Party scores
a victory in the November election.
Blomen said. people will get twice
as much for their labor.

The industrial socialism theory
postulates for need, not for proﬁt.
and refunds people for the full
value of their labor. unlike the
present wage system in America,
Blomen said.

Labaor vouchers, worth the
number of hours worked in a ‘labor
period, would be exchanged for
products. worth the amount of
labor hours put into their produc-
tion.

the verbal Scholastic Aptitude Test
(SAT) scores for the incoming class
increased slightly, in contrast to
the current national trend toward
decreasing SAT scores.

Concerning finance, Posvar said
Pitt has requested a 15% boost in
appropriations from the state for
next year's budget.

In response to a council
member’s request that the recent
death of Dr. Paul F. Lazarsfeld, a
sociology professor at Pitt, be
recognized by the council, Posvar
said, “I have never been more
saddened by the death of a
distinguished faculty member.”
Lazarsfeld was a nationally known

authority on public opinion and

mass communication.

In other business, Posvar said an
associate to assist Dave Powers,
the new provost for research, will
be appointed in the near future.

A task force to evaluate honors
programs at Pitt is being organi-
zed.

Self-evaluation of University
departments has already begun,
with the chemistry department
being the ﬁrst to be scrutinized by
experts from without the University
community.

A report by Clifford C. Ham,
chairman of the drafting committee
on the plan for the University
Senate proposed the newly approv-
ed Faculty Assembly of the
University Senate be comprised of
27 faculty members, who also
would serve on Senate Council; 27

SAAC:
Stress On
Pitt Service

BY RICH HARRY

Preliminary reports from the
Student Health Center indicate the
rate of students using Health
Center services has doubled since
the imposition of the $16 manda-
tory health fee this term, Vice
Chancellor of Student Affairs
Alfred Moye said yesterday.

Moye. speaking at a Student
Affairs Advisory Committee
(SAAC) meeting, also urged
student members of SAAC to
formulate suggestions for impro-
vising the effectiveness of the areas

ACLU Charges

|.D. Number Invades Privacy

BY LISA RUBENSTEIN

Pitt's use of Social Security
numbers for University identiﬁca-
tion constitutes an invasi: of
privacy and should be discontinued
accoring to Ellen M. Doyle.
executive Director of the American
Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).

“With the use of one number
you can use a computer and get a
complete proﬁle on someone's
life." Doyle said. “Use of the
social security number can be used
to retrieve ﬁles from data banks
kept by insurance companies, the
FBI. the Internal Revenue Service,
private corporations and the
University.

According to Doyle, one study.
Project Search, indicated an
individual's entire criminal history
could be retrieved within a matter
of minutes using only two queries
and an identiﬁcation number.

“But the risk to privacy is far
greater is far greater than the
advantages of a universal identiﬁ-
cation number," Doyle said.

Pitt Registrar Frank Reed said
the Social Security number is used
because it is an accurate identiﬁer.
“The name has always been a poor
identiﬁer. The social security
number is used because it is
something that a student will never
lose. A student wouldn't keep an
arbitrary student number."

“We can produce all a person's
university record 15 years after_
graduation through the use of the
social security number plogged into
a computer," Reed said.

Doyle claimed the chief problem
with a computer based system is
the ease in which computer data
banks can be lifted, and if one
number is used as the identifier. all
a person's complete records can be
acquired.

Reed said Pitt's computer

from invasion of privacy.

Doyle said Congress has already
indicated its disapproval of the use
of Social Security numbers as
universal identiﬁers through the
passage of the Privacy Act. The
Privacy Act prohibits federal, state
and local government agencies
from requiring disclosure of Social
Security numbers unless the
disclosure is required by federal
law or by a state law adopted
before January 1975.

Director of Pitt's Legal Services
William Hannan said the Univer-
sity is not subject to the Privacy Act
because of its status as a
state-related university."

Although there is no legislation
prohibiting the use of social
security numbers “it is a matter of
public pressure." Doyle said.

Reed said Pitt transferred from
the use of names and student’
numbers as a method of record
keeping in the late 1960s.

Costs Up“Due to Vandalism I

BY BRUCE WALDHOLTZ

Vandalism in the residence halls
and campus buildings costs thous-
ands of dollars each year and is
partially responsible for increases
in dorm fees over the last year.

Damages to the dormitories is
expected to be more than $20,000
worth, according to Housing
Director Don Hughes. While
students are billed for damages

‘I within their own rooms, Hughes

said the most costly destruction
occurs in hallways, stairs and
elevators.
The vandals rarely are caught.
Damages in the Schenley Quad
and Lothrop Street Residence are
practically nil, but the Towers

frequently suffer vandalism rang-
ing; from low cost incidents to
expensive elevator repairs.

Last year’s housing contract had
a stipulation requiring all students
on a floor to pay for damages on
their floor. This requirement has
been dropped from this year’s
contract, according to Hughes,
because of the difficulties in
enforcing the policy.

The clause never was actually
enforced, Hughes said. -

Hughes said the repair funds are
obtained from each student’s rent
which includes in it an estimate for
dorm damages this year.

Last year, 46.3% of all campus
police calls were in response to
vandalism, according to Police

Chief Curt Graham. This was an
increase of 11% over the previous
year. Many of the incidents were
of a minor nature and over half of
them were in response to thefts due
to unlocked dorm rooms, Graham
said.

False fire alarms also are a major
problem, Graham said, both
financially and legally. Last year,
99 false alarms were turned in at a
cost to the city of Pittsburgh of
about $200 each.

*4 Freshmen SAT's Up

National Scores Down

BY WILLIAM RENKUS

The averageiScholastic Aptitude-
Test (SAT) scores for this year's
freshman class are higher than the
scores of last year's freshman
according to a preliminary report
compiled by Pitt’s Ofﬁce of
Institutional Research.

Running counter to the national
trend, the average SAT verbal
score of Pitt freshman rose. Verbal
scores rose one percent while at the
same time the national score
dropped 0.7%. These ﬁgures
exclude freshmen athletes and
students enrolled through the
University Community Educational
Programs (UCEP).

The report is based on surveys
distributed to incoming freshmen
through the mail and at freshman
orientation.

The average SAT math score for
incoming freshmen rose two
percent over last year while the
national average remained the
same.

The preliminary data shows a
2.5% increase in the number of
College of Arts and Sciences (CAS)
freshmen with verbal scores over
600 and a three percent increase in
the number of CAS students over

600 in math.

Pitt UCEP freshmen show a drop
of 2.7% in verbal and a drop of
2.4% in SAT math test scores for
1976, according to the reports.

Freshman athletes at Pitt also
show a drop in their SAT verbal
test scores, from 430 to 407 and a
drop in their SAT math scores from
500 to 482 this year, thereport
states.

Sixty-six percent of this year’s
freshman class finished in the top
ﬁfth of their senior class in high
school. Last year, 67% ﬁnished in
the top ﬁfth.

Twenty-six percent of this year’s
freshman ﬁnished in the second
ﬁfth and four percent in the third
ﬁfth.

The data for the UCEP freshman
show 21% in the top ﬁfth of their
senior class, 29% in the second
ﬁfth and 20% in the third ﬁfth.

Statistics for freshman athletes
are not available for this year, but
last year's statistics show 26% in
the top ﬁfth, 35% in the second
ﬁfth and 16% in the third ﬁfth.

This year's freshman class is
comprised of 49.9% females and
50.1% males compared to the 1975
ﬁgures of 49.5% females to 50.5%
males.

"70 Years of Collegiate Journalism at the University of Pittsburgh"

Nickel and Dime

The recent decision by the University Communication Center that
requires student organizations to pay for the use of audio-visual
equipment threatens to set a disastrous precedent where students will
have to pay for services that were once free. Granted,‘ the cost of
renting the equipment isn’t much, but an already ﬁnancially
beleaguered Pitt student stands a chance of being nickled and dimed

into the poor house.

The Communication Center’s decision was precipitated by a 20% cut
in its budget. Faced with this cut back, the Center could either
drastically reduce audio-visual services to student organizations or
charge a slight rental fee. We feel that they made the right decision

considering the alternative.

The heart of the matter is they shouldn’t have had to make any

L decision at all. The logic behind the cutbacks was that less money

spend on services vmuld mean less money students would have to pay
for tuition. There is no real savings for students, however, if you keep
tuition down but make them pay for University services.

One might think that the use of audio-visual equipment by student
organizations would be covered by the student’s activity fee that we

pay each term. Unfortunately, it isn’t.

Since the Communication

Center falls under the jurisdiction of the Provost’s Ofﬁce, which
allocates fluids to academic departments, it does not receive money for
student services. The end result of this bureaucratic mix up is that
students pay for services they already have paid for. This, plus the fact
students now have to pay for their football tickets, plus the fact that

5 there isn’t very much free daytime programming, plus the fact that

most students aren’t involved in any student activity, means many
students realize little, if any, beneﬁt from their activities fee. _
As tuition keeps going up, students should have a’ right to expect a
maintenance of existing services without having to ‘pay out a nickle
here and a dime there everytirne they need a service, because the only

difference between being ﬁnancially murdered by one giant tuition

hike or strangled by the nickle and  doctrines of Pitt’s
administration is that the latter is a slower, more painful death.

Commuters Ignored  

BY LARRY CHABAN

[EDITOR’S NOTE: Larry Chabin is
ajformer president of the Commu-
ter Association.]

The Wednesday, September 8,
1976 issue of the Pitt News
reported that commuting students
no longer are with representation.
This statement is unfortunately
true for the ﬁrst time in six years.

For the ﬁrst time since 1970,
when the Commuter Association
was formed, commuters are with-
out an organization, to represent
them to the Student Government
Board, the university administra-
tion and the Port Authority of
Allegheny County. Commuters
now represent the disenfranchised
majority at Pitt. There is no one on
Student Government and few in the
administration who understand
commuter problems and are
looking for solutions. How this
situation came about and what it
means for commuters at Pitt needs
to be brought out from the
commuter side.

For the past couple of years, the
Commuter Association was accus-
ed of doing nothing in the interest
of commuting students. . The

V-accusations were made by “res-

'ponsible student leaders” (i.e.,

SGB and its Allocations Commit-
tee).

These statements were clearly
contrary to the Association's
record. The Commuter Association
was instrumental in instituting the
U-Bus system with the Port
Authority, in opening the student
parking lots by Trees Hall and in
Panther Hollow, expansion of the
bus system into Oakland, in having
PAT offer poast-secondary stu-

' dents reduced bus rates and, last

winter, keeping bus rates down.
The Commuter Association contin-
ually made efforts to get greater
daytime programming for commu-
ters. It also attempted to get the
Student Union Board and SGB
programming to present more
extensive programs during the day.
This effort was just beginning to
bear fruit when the Commuter
Association was shut down.
Finally, a myriad of minor services
—were provided, from distributing
parking maps to help with parking
tickets.

The main stumbling block to the
Commuter Association came from
the elected student “representa-
tives" on campus and their
minions. Since 1974 budgets were
submitted to the Student Govern-
ment Board, ,1 the Association has
been continually out until its
budget was unrealistic for the job it
had to do. The money allocated to
the Commuter Association went
from about $8,000 in 1973-74 to
about $4,000 in 1975-76.

The major cut came when the
Magic Bus the commuter news-
letter, was cut from 56 pages per
year in 1973-74 to 16 pages per year
in 1974-75 and nothing in 1975-76.
This slash represented a strangu-
lation of information sources aimed
directly at commuters.

When attempts were made to.

open new information sources they
were rejected by Allocations and
SGB as a waste of funds,
impractical or unnecessary. These
options ranged from mailings to
bi-monthly pages in the Pitt News.
Without information. it is extrem-
ely difficult for commuters to be
informed of events aimed in their
direction. This, in turn, leads to a
deeper detachment from the

» to the end which he seeks.

'l'erroris1s Serious Threat

BY DAN MULHOLLAND I

The recent episode involving that
group of Croatian terrorists who
hijacked a. jet from New York to
Paris has made it painfully aware to
an increasing number of people
that something must be done soon
to curb this serious threat to
civilized society. This particular
caper resulted in the death of a
policeman and needlessly endan-
gered scores of innocent persons.
Fortunately, no more lives were
lost, but the situation could have
been different. This article will
attempt to propose a workable
solution to the problem of such
terroristic acts.

To begin with, one must first
understand that terrorism should
not be considered a run of the mill
crime. Indeed, it should not be
considered as a crime at all. The
terrorist sees himself as a warrior
for a holy cause, as an instrumen-
tality of destruction. As such, his
own life means little in comparison
And
because he is such a fanatic, he
will use any means available to
advance toward his ultimate goal,
including. the murder of innocent
men, women and even children.

Even more frightening is the fact

that when one cuts through the

rhetoric used to justify the
terrorist’s deeds, one‘ finds that
his real objective is not “Croatian
Self Determination” or “Palestin-
ian Liberation” or “Black African

University community. Student
Government was continually advis-
ed of this connection but, as with
almost all suggestions from the
Commuter Association, chose to
ignore it.

Student Government ignoring
the Commuter Association and
commuters is not a recent
happening. This situation was the
reason the Association was formed.
Throughout its history, the group
attempted to combat this problem
and with few exceptions was
unsuccessful. But ignorance
concerning commuters by SGB
stretched to ridicule and hostility at
times. At some SGB meetings, the
“stereotype" .commuter (as seen
by SGB) was held up for ridicule.

Freedom,” but is in reality the total
destruction of law and order. For
the terroristic mind is basically a
nihilistic one, and in many cases,
the terroristic acts are not a means
to an end, but an end in
themselves.

A brief survey of the history of
terrorism is even more disconcert-
ing than a study of its psychology.
Some of the more unfortunate
instances which come to mind
immediately are the “Munich
Massacre” of 1972 where several
members of the Israeli Olympic
team were "methodically executed,
as well as the slaughter of the
schoolchildren at Malaat. Atroci-
ties committed by the Viet Cong
and other so-called “liberation

armies” on civilian populations

also stand out. The assassination
of American diplomats abroad has
become so frequent that it is almost
considered routine.

These are only a few examples
and there is no indication that the
situation will improve. On the
contrary, the recent experience of
Lebanon provides us with a
sobering warning of what might
happen if terrorism is permitted to
get out of hand: It degenerates into
civil war and,
anarchy.

Few reasonable men would
dispute that the current state of

opinions on what form that action

increasing incidence of this latter-
day barbarism, we cannot afford to
take anything but the most swift
and decisive steps to avoid total

-catastrophe. Moreover, the Amer-

ican government should take the
lead in combatting terrorists, since
our way of life is most frequently
the target of their maniecal wrath.

The F.B.l., in conjunction with
military intelligence units, should
immediately’ begin a full scale
operation aimed at neutralizing,
and eventually destroying terrorist
elements within our borders.
Known or admitted terrorists
should be ferreted out and rounded
up as soon as possible, and any
organization or. individual giving
aid’ and comfort to the terrorists
prosecuted for treason.

This may sound harsh to some,
but by the terrorist’s own deﬁni-
tion, they are at war with the
established order, and as such they
should be considered enemies of
the United States. They are not
mere criminals, but warriors, who
give no quarter and should be

‘ accorded none. Undoubtedly, they

will try to hide behind rights
‘guaranteed decent citizens by our
Constitution, but they must not be
permitted to. do so. If they were,
one of the basic purposes of that
document, as stated in the
Preamble would be contravened:
“To insure domestic tranquility.”
Such a program would, if
pursued with the requisite fervor,
sweep the scourge of terrorism
from our land. And it would
provide other civilized nations with

a shining example of how to drive «

the forces of chaos from the face of
the earth. With a concerted effort,
terrorism can be eradicated in a
few short years. But if nothing is
done, we will continue to be sucked
into the vortex of depravity until
finally, all will be lost.

Other times, ideas, suggestions
and criticism directed at SGB
concerning commuting student’s
problems were met with downright
hostility and dismissed out of hand.

The crisis this year took shape
before SGB’s committee on student
organizations. The Commuter

Association was referred for review ‘

by Allocations due to a misunder-
standing between them and the
Commuter Association representii-_
tives concerning the number of
members in the group. The
committee reviewed the case and,
ignoring statements of member-
ship by committee representatives,
ordered an election held to prove
these membership statements.
Thistook place in the beginning

Francie Trachtenberg, Bruce Wald-

of May. Showing a lack of
knowledge concerning commuters,
the committee set a deadline of
July 1, 1976. Lacking methods of
publicizing the election and ignor-
ing the fact that commuters aren't
on campus during this period with
any regularity was not a concern of
the committee. An election was
held and alleged impropriates
occurred. When July came, the
committee was to rule but no
contact was made with Commuter
Association representatives.

in the meantime, the Commuter
Association tried to go about its-
business but was“ obstructed at
every turn by the committee.

’ Finally, on July 7th, it dissolved.

The amazing thing was and still is
that Student Government, who
knew about the whole situation, did
nothing to resolve it. Again; SGB
was ignoring commuters. ‘

Commuters Ignored

/ Continued from PM: 4))
This leaves the commuter
situation about were it was in 1969.
SGB President Barry Weisband
claims he understands commuter’s
problems but won’t do anything
until commuters show interest‘ and
some leadership comes forward.
This statement is very irrespon-
sible and sh\oVVs a lack of
knowledge on his part. This also
ignores the fact that there were
interested commuters on campus
and that they were willing to work
. on the commuting student’s behalf.
Those efforts ended in July due
to the obstructionism of its
committees. Under discussion by
SGB is setting up of a task-force to
look into problems facing commu-
ters and recommending solutions.
The Commuter Association knew
the problems and was working to
solve them. Last year a
comprehensive survey of commu-
ters was taken and areas of work
identified. But without the
Commuter Association this work

must be done again due to the lack
of knowledge in this area by SGB.

The situation as it stands now, is
commuters are further separated
from the university community and
the work ~ under way by the
Commuter Association has come to

‘an end. Work on expanded parking

for 1977, on better utilization of the
Panther Hollow and Katzur lots,
expanded information sources for
commuters and contact with PAT
has stopped.

There is no longer any organized
body to push for more daytime-
programming of better facilities on
campus for commuters. And this
December, with a bus strike very
possible, there will be many a
commuter stranded at a cold bus
stop for lack of a car pool. This
situation can only be resolved by an
active Student Government and the
commuting students at Pitt. For all
their supposed apathy, all my faith
is in the commuting student, rather
than the “representative” student
government.

I noticed in passing the ‘open

You seem to loose sight of the
fact that it is not the nature of the

of invasion of privacy, but the
system for obtaining the data.

I   E """"""""" P  

In the pre-computer days, if I
wanted to dig up credit information
on a particular prospective client,
I'd have to do much telephoning
and clerical work.- Now, I can call a
data bank if 1 need the information.

The data were always there, only
the means and availability of it
have changed.

All three of the major
department stores in town and one
bank duplicate at least one hundred
characters of information in keep-
ing record of my account. Multiply
this duplication by the few
thousands of duplications, and you
start to have a rather incredible
amount of wasted space. The
duplicated searches and wastes of

staggering when you generalize
this to the population at large. Yet,
this is the state of the system,
which, in the long run, is paid for
with all its redundancies by the
consumer.

You would also know, if you had
computer experience, that it is no
more difficult to search a data base
in which someone’s name and
social security number are on file
by either of the two pieces of data.
The machine keeps ALL data in an
internal encoded form, typically
ASCII or BCD, and it is only a
question of searching a nine
character area for a social security
number versus a twenty character
area for a’ name.

Data, as I see it, should be there
when a person needs it. I should
not be a ‘slave’ to it, it should serve
me. In serving me it should not do
injustice to another.

If used properly, data can
provide us with many great and
fantastic services such as being
able to get one’s medical records at
any hospital in the United States,

even making the public library

If you would raise your heads
above the smoke that you are
creating and look at the things that
centralized information processing
could do for you, you may even see
the real problem of this era.
That is, you may see that the

problem lies in the system that will
maintain such data and the
accountability of the persons who
have access to the system. It is
NOT in keeping the information on
ﬁle that violates my rights, it is who
has access to that information and

Computer time become quite _< how accountable they are or can be

held. That is the real problem.
And that is the real goal that we
should be working for. To create
an information system that will
serve our needs and protect our
rights.

Remember also, that if we do
have a syste with accountability,
we also create a system with little
or no fraud. One in which you can’t
hide funds for illicit use, one in
which I -can't get your credit
records without your explicit
direction or get any medical
records without your permission.

It may even force us to be fair to
everyone!

I would only hope that in the
future, you would facillitate the

creation of data base systems to
benefit the individuals whose -

records were contained in the ﬁles
and also to safeguard that same
data from illicit access, thus giving
the individual more freedom and
greater protection, which, should
be the goal of your organization.

Most Sincerely,
Jon J. Danzak

Students Form Emergency Aid Group

BY MREA CSORBA

A student health care program
to supplement Pitt's Student
Health Service during off-hours
and weekends is being formed by
students from the Medical Action
Committee.

The peer medical aid program
will be -a student—run organization
offering emergency first aid care to
the Pitt community by students
trained in advanced first aid and
cardio-pulmonary recessitation.

Under the Medical Action group,
which provides free diagnostic
clinics at Pitt each term, the new
program will provide training for
volunteer students to respond to
late—night campus emergencies.
They will function on an on-call
basis, providing emergency care on
the scene. For cases that require
hopitalization, the students would
stabilize the patient until the

University Ambulance Service
arrives.

“Late night service of this kind is
badly needed by Pitt students to
take up the slack after the Health
Service closes at 11 p.m.,” Ken
Spear, president of Medical Action,
said. “It saves students from
having to walk down to Presbyter-
ian (-University Hospital) in an
emergency."

Services will be provided free
and the program will be funded
through the student activities fee.

“Pitt is one of seven colleges
around the country that will have a
student-directed, student-manned
care service. And our success
depends on volunteers for the
training and also for students to
call on us for help," Spear said.

The training session for appli-
cants will run for ten weeks this
term, with six-hour lectures each

week by Jerry Hyner, health
educator at the Health Service.
Additional guest speaker seminars
also have been scheduled.

“After this initial pilot program,
run in conjunction with the Health
Service, the program will be a
self-perpetuating organization with
this term’s trainees certifying next
term's corp," Spear said.

  
        

“The training will be especially
beneﬁcial to pre-med students
because they are expected to have
some practical experiences before
applying to medical school.”

Applications for the training
classes are due this Friday at room
321 Student Union with the first
screening meeting scheduled for
Monday.

New Plan
For Pitt's
Book Store

A new security system at the
Alpha Phi Omega (APO) Book
Exchange has been instituted to
alleviate some of the book sale’s
problems.

Jim Manfred, co-chairman of the
sale, explained checkpoints will be
posted at the door and members
will, patrol the area to discourage
book thieves. Also, to prevent
price slip swapping, APO writes

security numbers directly on each ‘

book.

Last year, $100 worth of books
were stolen, according to Bruce
Keeler, APO vice president in
charge ‘of services. To reimburse
owners of stolen books, APO
delved into the money students
paid for the exchange service (a
dime to buy or sell each book).
Thus, APO was $100 short of the
sum they originally had to donate
to charities and service projects.

BY BILL MOORE

Zoologists, naturalists and archi-
tects have been working in
cooperation for the past 20 years to
improve the conditions at zoos for
both the animals and the viewing
public. The sad situation they are
trying to rectify is epitomized by
Pittsburgh’s zoo.

COMMENTARY

V The problem, in a word, is
overcrowding. Too many animals,
most of them native to large plains
or forests, or crammed into tiny,
unnatural, unaesthetic cubicles.

From a zoologist’s point of view,
it is bad for the health of the
animals, seriously impedes their
ability and desire to breed and
eliminates any chance of seriously
studying their native habits.

Any zoologist, or zookeeper, will
readily admit I -that lions in a
six-by-ten-foot cage do not act like
lions on the Serengeti Plain.

The naturalists have entered the
picture for obvious reasons. It is
cruel in the eyes of naturalists to
impose such unnatural conditions
on animals. More than a few
people visiting the Highland Park
Zoo on any given Saturday make
the same observation.

‘Theoretically. architects are the
solution. They have had consider-
able success, especially in Sweden
and other northern European
countries, in designing enclosed
environments that are both safe
and attractive for animals.

The architects are only theoreti-
cally a solution, however, because
of the all too common stumbling
block known as money.

But assuming the Highland Park
Zoo found some quick cash, much
could be done. The improvement,
or more exactly, the elimination
that is most needed is the razing of
the main zoo building. The main
building houses the big cats, an
impressive collection of lions,
tigers, pumas, cougars, the mon-

Polar bears in the Pittsburgh zoo don’t really have a natural habitat

to prowl.

KISSINGER TO MEET
WITH AFRICAN PRESIDENTS

DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania
(AP)—The Tanzanian government
said yesterday Secretary of State
Henry A. Kissinger will face
demands from black African
presidents for U.S. support of
guerrilla forces ﬁghting white
minority regimes.

As Kissinger flew to Africa for
shuttle talks seeking racial peace in
southern Africa, police gunﬁre
reportedly killed six persons in the

black South African township of

Soweto. The deaths brought to 10
the number of lives reported lost in
two days of a job boycott by tens of
thousands of workers.

MOTHER NEEDS TO KNOW

WASHINGTON (AP)—The
Food and Drug Administration,
expressing concern that mothers
aren’t getting enough information
about their children's food, said
yesterday it is proposing ‘new
ingredient labeling requirements
for baby foods.

The proposals would require

baby food manufacturers to label-

the percentage of the main
ingredients in both infant foods and
junior foods and, in the case of
infant foods only, to label the
percentage of each major ingred-

i°~iz“***t***inu*tftiiiﬂttttinznnnuttrtttttt

keys and apes, including a very
rare orangutan; and the odds and
ends, such as giraffes, elephants,

I kangaroos and rheas.

The larger apes, such as Jiggs
the orangutan, and the gorilla and
chimpanzees, have little or no room
to swing, run, charge or explore.
Their cages are perhaps the
sorriest. As far as the public is
concerned, they can hardly see the
“maniﬁcent specimens.” As for
the animals, they ar either in
solitary confinement or are two
depressed or neurotic. to notice
their fellow inmates.

Neurosis is the most common
malady in zoos. Countless
monkeys spend their days rocking
back and forth in one corner. Not
much of a life, and not much to look
at.

The cats have only hard cemend
ﬂoors to roam. It is bad on their
feet and offers no opportunity to
stretch and tone their usually
impressive muscles. They often
pace for hours on end, with
drooping tails and bored expres-
sions. They have no doubt
memorized every indentation in
their institutional green ﬂoors.

In such conditions, tigers don’t
mate, lions don’t roar, and pumas
don’t climb trees.

Mating, by the way, serves a
stronger purpose than just occupy-
ing the animals’ time. In some
cases, it will eventually mean the
difference between extinction and
continuation of the species. Many

animals are so rare in the wilds that

Zoos Overcrowded—-Cramp Animals’ Style

Neurosis is a common disease of zoo animals.

the only new members of the
species around are born in a select
number of zoos or animal reserves.

One glance at the elephant or
giraffe quarters dispels all ques-
tions about their well being. The
elephants it seems, are literally
rubbing against each other in their

compound.

The better zoos, which are
beginning to call themselves
animal reserves, approach the

problem in one of two ways. They
either ﬁnd quite a bit of funding or
they specialize.

Specialization means that a zoo
the size of the Highland Park Zoo

decides .to limit its scope to just
African plain animals, or North
American animals, or, for that
matter, just primates.

They invariably rip out the
ancient brick jails and erect
camoflauged fences. What they
as best as possible, is
approximate the natural environ-
ment of the animal they specialize
in and drastically increase the area
each animal is allotted.

Further beneﬁtting the animals,
the viewing public and the research
zoologists immeasurably, the ani-
mals are mixed. Species which

Liddy Pushes Prison Rights

BY JOHN W. ZUCKER
Associated Press Writer

DANBURY, Conn.—Once he
was counsel to Richard Nixon's
re-election committee. Now G.
Gordon Liddy is a power plant clerk
in Danbury federal prison, ﬁghting
for inmates’ rights.

Already he has won a broader
definition of privileged mail—that
which can be opened only in the
presence of an inmate. Now he is
complaining in federal court that
privileged mail is still being opened
when the inmate isn’t present.

Liddy represented himself when
he appeared in U.S. District Court
in Hartford Aug. 19 to present
complaints from himself and other
prisoners about privileged mail ._ He
also claimed prisoners——like him-
self—who were placed in “admin-
istrative detention” did not get
adequate explanations " for the
disciplinary action.

In April U.S. District Judge Jon
0. Newman ruled that prisoners
who were put in detention must get
written explanations. At the same
time he designated more categories
of mail as “privileged.”

Liddy, who organized the Wat-
ergate break-in team, is serving

A 6-20 years on burglary and related

charges for his part in the June,
1972, burglary at Democratic
national headquarters in Washing-
ton. He is eligible to be considered
for parole in 1981.

In February, Liddy was placed
for several days in one of the small,
locked cells reserved for disciplin-
ing Danbury inmates. - He was
accused of being insolent to a
guard but was later cleared after an
administrative hearing.

Warden George C. Wilkinson
said any violations of the federal

Jazz Band Auditions

Will Be Held in
‘ Room 132 Music Bldg
N 15 SEPTEMBERI976

court's orders have been due to

“human errors," not policy deci-
sions.

Wilkinson won"t discuss the case
because it is still pending before
Newman. But he did say Liddy
spends “a lot of time at the law
library.”

Liddy has asked Newman to hold
Wilkinson in contempt for alleged
continued violations of policy at
Danbury.

New Plan
For Pitt's
Book Sale

(Continued from Page 8)

Again this year, APO will not
release any books or money after
the September 24th deadline.
“The. deadline will not be
extended,” emphasized Manfred.
Students ‘must claim their unsold
books and money on September 22,
23 or 24.

Last year some students protest-
ed APO’s refusal to return books or
money to 98 students. These
students failed to retrieve their
property before’ the deadline

' designated on their receipts.

All unclaimed books will be sent
to Western Penitentiary for the
prisoners’ use, Keeler said. Jack
Hayes,‘ Office of Veteran Affairs
director, will act as the go-between
for Pitt and the penitentiary.

Pitt's Price Adds Up

BY MARILYN WEISS

Every fall students are slapped
with fees for being late", both
part-time and full-time students.
Here are some of the fees about
which students usually gripe.

GENERAL UNIVERSITY FEE:
This is listed in the handbook under
“Fees,” although according to
Assistant Treasurer Ted Corbett, it
is not a fee, but part of the tuition.
The General University Fee is used
as collateral for loans which the
University borrows from other
institutions. If the University
cannot meet its obligations, lenders
have the right to take $120 from
each student’s tuition.

APPLICATION FEE: The appli-

. cation fee of $15 covers the cost of

reviewing each student’s applica-
tion and maintaining the applica-
tion_ files for everyone who has
applied to the University.

LATE PAYMENT FEES: If a
student does not pay his invoice by
the due date, he must pay a late fee
of $25. Before the $25 fee was

' instituted a few years ‘ago, the fine

was a minimum of $5 and a
maximum of $15, varying‘ with the
number of credits a student
carried.

Before the fine was raised,
thousands of students remained in
class until the middle of the term. If
their studies were coming along

well, they paid their invoice plus
the late fee and continued going to
classes. If not, they would drop out
without paying their invoices.

With the present high late fee, the
“wait-and-see then pay” attitude
has dwindled. According to
Student Accounts. Manager James
Beavers, the late fee, plus

cancellation of-classes has led to

“better utilization of class space.”

CHANGE OF STATUS FEE: A
full-time student carries 12 or more
credits. If a student’s credit load
falls under 12, he becomes a
part-time student. (A part-time
student pays per credit, while
full-time students play a ﬂat rate).
A student who changes from a
full- to a part-time student, or vice
versa, is assessed a $15 “change of

status fee.” According to Corbett,

ﬁve years ago, when a student
wanted to add/drop a course, he
was charged $15. _Since the
University didn’t really need the
money, the fee was dropped
provided a student’s credit load
didn’t fall under 12.

When a student’s credit load
falls below 12, his ﬁle has to ‘be
reviewed because he is no longer
eligible for many types of student
aid. In addition, the University‘ has
to report a change in statistics to
the Commonwealth of Pennsyl-
vania. So the student is charged
this fee for the extra University
work load.

The University Oratory
of   ~
The Holy Spirit Parish

THE ROMAN CATHOLIC UNIVERSITY PARISH of The Diocese of Pittsburgh
was created in 1967 to meet the special needs and aspirations of a seeking and
learning community. Through worship, study and a wide program of other activ-
ities, the University Oratory seeks to serve the students and faculty of the Oakland
area. It is their Parish and represents their effort to build Christian Community.

First Woman Promoted
ROTC Cadet Commander

BY BOB PELLEGRINI

For the first time in its nearly
70-year existence at Pitt, the
Reserve Ofﬁcer Training Corps
(ROTC) has a female cadet
commander.

Cadet Paula Toski was promoted
to the rank of cadet lieutenant
colonel in a ceremony yesterday,
making her the top cadet in the
ROTC unit.

Toski, a senior in business
education, was promoted on the
basis of her academic average,
ROTC grade average and summer
camp evaluation. Toski also was
rated second highest in her coed
platoon at Ft. Bragg, N.C. this

summer when she attended ROTC’ if

advanced summer camp.
“Everybody worked pretty well

‘ together in the platoon and it

convinced me that there is a
deﬁnite place for women in the
Army,” Toski said. “They can
handle most jobs as well as men.

Even when we did things that
required a lot of muscle, we
learned how to work as a group to

_ compensate.

“Summer camp also‘ convinced
me that women just aren't physical
capable for most combat duties that
require physical stamina. On the
obstacle course, the guys would
help us over some obstacles, but in
actual combat, we’d only jeopar-
dize the whole platoon by putting a
burden on it."

Toski doesn’t see any V great
changes in the ROTC program.

“I'd like to see a little more
participation by the female cadets,
though,” she added. “In the past,
the female cadets were put into the
background. Whenever we had a
demonstration, or were on training
exercises with male cadets, we
were usually put where we couldn’t
do any harm—or any good, for that
matter.

“It was like a game of street
football where they always tell the
shortest and slowest kid ‘you go
long.’ It isn’t so bad now, and I
don't think that’ll be much of a
problem from now on.”

One male ROTC cadet said
adjusting to female cadets took a
while. '

“When Ijoined ROTC, I guess I
saw the Army as the last male
stronghold in a sea of rising
feminism. It was a little surprising
to find out that 25% of the unit was
female. Female cadets do
everything we do, and usually as
well as we do, and in the end that's
all that matters."

Dylan: Still Making 'em Rave

BY DEANNA LOUISE

It’s not his music. It’s not his
voice. It’s not his face with that
distinctive aquiline nose.

It is his lyrics, insist Dylan
addicts, who watched the concert
broadcast on NBC last night.

True. Why else would thousands
gaze ﬁxedly for hours at a man who
was more casual than any concert
performer would be?

Yet the fans turned out last year
at Colorado State University for the
Rolling Thunder Revue, starring
Bob Dylan, like they did ten years
ago, making Dylan one of the few
singers who survived the 60s
protest era.

Survive it...he started it, becom-
ing a social conscious and dissident

. folk-hero of the campus teach-in

crowd and youths searching for an
end to the draft.

Dylan was the first to say all of
those things everyone else wanted
to say but never could. And his
verbs were caustic and the
overtones potent, until the late 60s
when his poems became mystical
and subdued as he continued to
croon constructive criticism.

In the 70s Dylan fans began to
wonder, “Will I still like him now
that he seems content, almost
settled down and domestic?”

They couldn’t kick the Dylan
habit, because constant change and
unpredictability was the man. And
he practiced what he preached.

The taping last night was
testimony to his unpredictability.

Despite a rendition of “Blowin’
In The Wind” by Dylan and his
one-time lover Joan Baez, which
didn’t do homage to the original
recording of the country song
typical of his pre-folk-rock style,"

BOB DYLAN

the lyrics were more potent and
contemporary than they ever have
been.

“How many deaths does it take
till we know that too many people
have died?...”

And then came the Vietnam war.

gallery’s ﬁrst exhibit still sticks in
my mind with their beautiful
organic form accented with decora-
tive bird feathers. Those pots, and
the silver and gold cord box-
sculptures that shares space with
them, put the Elephant Walk on

the map for gallery-goers on it’s
christening night.

Unfortunately, this present ex-
hibit fails in the wake of it’s
predecessors.

The earlier shows had mixed
paintings with crafts to a varied
advantage, but here, when the bulk
of the show is water colors and
drawings, they are weak. Arid four
large stoneware vases that fill out
the show are too weak to pull the
weight.

Water colorist Robert Perrine
puts forth an intriguing philosophy
in his works, but the fault is that
the philosophy is better expressed
on his printed resume than on the
artist sheets.

Perrine is struck by the eternal
conflict between the free-ﬂowing
capriciousness of our primal id
versus the restrictions imposed on
it by social living.

,To express this, Perrine gives
free reign to the sensual, swirling
mass of abstract expressionistic
strokes that ‘bleed’ through the
hard-edged perimeters that try to

really came from musically. This
time, Baez and Dylan, in two-part
harmony, did justice to the
long-lived song.

The best songs of the show came
from Dylan the- observer and
redeemer. “Mozambique,” a cut
from his latest album Desire,
featuring his violinist Scarlet
Rivera, takes everyone away from
the anxieties of today to a land
where “the sky is aqua blue, and
all the couples are dancing cheek to
cheek. Where we can’ be alone just
me and you.” (Probably referring
to his wife Sara, to whom another
cut on the album is devoted).

When “Mozambique” -and
“Sara” were cut, Dylan’s marriage
was on the rocks. Both songs
reflected his desire to patch things
up.
“Shelter from the_Storm” from

Ouirageously Funny.
Soberly Candid

BY M. PATRICK MONAHAN

It’s . refreshing to watch a
comedian who is not bound to old
cliches and a proven format.

Dick Shawn is such a comedian.
He performed before a standing-
room-only crowd at the Student
Union Ballroom last night and left
them holding their sides and
marveling at his quick mind and
biting satirizations.

Shawn ‘is humor touches on many
topics. Be it pro football,
Hollywood heroes, the current
presidential campaign, rock stars,
fantasy or Las Vegas, the zany
Shawn had his own hilarious way of
interpreting these mundane insti-
tutions.

Some classic Shawn quips:
“Gerald Ford couldn’t pass silent
read." And what about Evil
Knievel, he made 37 million for
jumping into a hole?” On being
Jewish, “The Arabs will never
wipe out Israel: Everybody needs a
place to shop." .

Another attractive aspect of
Shawn's humor is his ability to mix
his clever satire with bits of
vaudeville, slapstick and improvi-
zation.

When was the last time you saw
a comedian play Shakespeare’s
Othello with a banana in his
mouth?’ Or singing a 1976 version
of the Battle Hymn of the Republic
while bouncing oranges off the
ceiling? Ridiculous? Yes. Funny?
Absolutely. Shawn is a sophisti-
cated loon.

The more -serious side of Shawn
emerged when lhad dinner with
him right after his well-received
hour-and-a-half performance.

He mentioned to me that his
humor has taken on a political
leaning in recent years and that
this shift has not always been
warmly received.

“I used to work Las Vegas,
regularly, 13 to 14 weeks out of the
year. But once the casino’s owner
got wind of my act...they got pretty
upset. You see, Las Vegas is a
money town. With plenty of rich
farmers, ranchers, coming in and
blowing stacks of money. And
when you get a comedian up on
stage attacking President Nixon
and the whole Watergate incident
in his act, and asking questions and
pointing out irregu1arities...the

sparks ﬂy. And because of this I_ m
haven’t been asked to work Las

Vegas in nearly four years," Shawn
said. ' » . ‘
When asked about the current
presidential campaign, Shawn
laughed and, nearly choking on an
olive, replied, “Politics is an awful
lot like show business. Charisma in
most cases takes you a lot further
than talent.‘ It works with political
candidates just as much with
comedians. ’ ’

“Take Jimmy Carter and Johnny
Carson for instance. It’s not what
they say, it’s how they say it.
Carter never says anything pro-
found, or different than what
politicians have been saying for

love Headlines ‘Obsession’

BY M.C. PILECKI

When Brian DePalma first broke
onto the major feature scene a few
years ago with Sisters, he was
hailed as “the new Hitchcock.”

He wasn't, but he did manage a

- small success with a taut psycho-

logical thriller very much mirroring
Psycho, and good things were
expected from him. Then last year
he broke out with Phantom of the
Paradise, a film more in the Ken
Russell than Alfred Hitchcock vein,
and—despite its merits——it was a
colossal bomb.

DePalma is back on safe ground
with Obsession, again trying to
copy the Master and one of his
greatest film accomplishments,
Vertigo. For those of you who
don't recall that 1958 masterpiece
(regarded by many critics as his
finest work). Vertigo concerns a
man's obsession with a mysterious
woman he fell in love with and
whose subsequent death he feels
responsible for. When he meets a
near-double of the lady, he makes
her over to be an exact duplicate of
his lost love.

With a few minor variations,
there you have the plot for
Obsession. Cliff Robertson is a
New Orleans businessman whose
wife and child are bizarrely
kidnapped on the couple’s tenth
wedding anniversary. The wife

(Genevieve Bujold) is portrayed as
something of a mystery——she
doesn't have a single word of
dialogue.

Well not to reveal too much of
the plot, but an attempt to rescue
the victims (Robertson didn't pay
the ransom on the advice of the
police) is botched, and kidnappers
and kidnapped alike are lost in a
freak accident. Robertson blames
himself, and carries his obsessive
guilt for years until—-—guess what?
—he meets a near-double of his
wife (also Genevieve Bujold).

After a whirlwind courtship in
her native Florence. they decide to
marry, move back to New Orleans
and both become obsessed with
Robertson’s first wife.

Obsession is an exciting roman-
tic thriller—-very much like Hitch-
cock, true-—but with a pure Brian
DePalma ending. The twists of the
plot. even though somewhat
predictable. do manage to sustain a
suspense that few movies today
can. ~

The ﬂick is great——if you’re
willing to overlook a few things.
One major problem is Robertson-
the main character of the movie——
and therefore almost constantly on
camera. He doesn't seem to
change his face throughout the
entire movie, but retains a sort of
simpering expression regardless of
the scene. Also, he doesn’t age

one bit in spite of the jump in
years.

Also. the camerawork is not up to
the standards one might expect
from a Hitchcock emulator.
DePalma uses some artsy—craftsy
moves that don’t appear to have
any particular purpose——a camera
gimmick that sticks out is just a
gimmick. Also, there's some fuzzy
focus used that Hitchcock would
never tolerate.

Still. there are many bright
spots. One is Bujold, a sorely
underworked actress, who gives
life to the movie in her portrayal of
the second wife and is quite
remarkably credible in» some
ﬂashback scenes. For her fole, she
seemed more pleasing than did
Kim Novak in the Hitchcock
original.

Obsession was the last movie for
the late Bernard Herrmann (who
also did Sisters as well as Psycho.
Vertigo, and several other Hitch-
cock ﬁlms], and the film, if nothing
else. is a tribute to one of the great
composers of the screen.

The ﬁlm is well written, and
there are several good touches. As
a romance, it certainly is in the
Hitchcock genre, and one that is
certainly appealing to the mass
audience. And if you worry about
that sort of thing, there is
practically no sex or violence——it
should make it to the Late Show
intact.

“Johnny Carson is similar in
many respects. I've been on his
show _a number of times in the last
ten years and watched him perform
before audiences in Las Vegas. I
personally don't think he's a very
good comedian. I People come to

a big name. They go home and
tell their friends they saw Johnny
Carson, but can't remember
anything about the material he laid
on them,” Shawn said.

To most Pitt students, Shawn is
familiar from these Tonight Show
appearances. But he also has

appeared in quite a few Hollywood —

ﬁlm productions. Among them
Wake Me When It’s Over with the
late Ernie Kovacs, It’s A Mad,

A&P BRAND

    

Look-F it

Mad, Mad, Mad World, and Mel
Brook's The Producers.

The Producers is my personal
favorite of all the movies in which I
appeared. Mel Brooks has a very
creative comedy mind. He uses a
lot of improvization and is not
afraid to take a chance. Plus, he's
plenty crazy,” Shawn said with a
devilish grin. ~

“College students understand me,
while hardware salesmen from
mid-America have trouble grasping
where I'm coming from. A lot of
my material requires audiences to
check current references, and to
use their brain. I've found that
there are plenty of audiences who

refuse to think. And when this
happens,...it's right into the old
toilet," Shawn replied.

As for the new
directly on the horizon?

“Most of the younger comics, at
least the ones I've seen are good.
David Brenner and Gabe Kaplan
are excellent, and Richard Pryor
and Steve Landesburg are screams.
But it's tough to keep the creative
juices flowing over the long haul,
Shawn said.

Dick Shawn has sidestepped this
comedic afﬂiction. His humor is
fresh and vibrant, and perfectly
suited for the audiences of today.
One funny man.

Aerosmith
Rocks - Columbia #-698

The “boys from Boston,"
Aerosmith, seem to be making
it——at least in terms of dollars and
cents.

All four of the band’s albums are
platinum, while half of the dates on
their current tour ﬁnds them
headlining football stadiums all
across America. With such an
impressive track record it seems
self-evident that Aerosmith is big
with the people. And the rock
critics?

Absolutely not. Aerosmith has
always been shortchanged on the
critical respect due them. Critics
call them “rip-offs" of the Stones
and Yardbirds, classifying their
music and stage antics as derivi-

tives of those two bands. And
indeed. the critics claims are
justiﬁed.

But what’ band doesn't borrow
from the work of others? Nothing
is even totally original. Look at the
early Beatles. They played Chuck

Suzanne's segments are over-

It is a credit to the Massies’
collaboration skill that just as
Suzanne's heavy style becomes
unbearable, it is interrupted by
segments written in ‘her husband's

This alternating technique tends
to jumble the sequence of some

Olympic Gold Winner H°'d R°"‘

BY SUSAN J. REIMER
Associated Press Writer

Beneath the Olympic gold and
the glitter of her new status as a
professional ice skater, Dorothy

Hamill is still a nervous 20-year- '

old, clearly taken aback by the
public demands of her.

“I’m a lot more nervous now,”
she said yesterday on the eve of her
billed debut as a professional. “I
got sick on the train yesterday.”

Her performance with the Ice

‘ Capades in the Civic Arena tonight

is the start of a new life that will
take her to 20 U.S. cities in nine
months.

“It’s really difficult for her
now,” said Juanita Visconti, the
companion and instructor to whom
Hamill glanced for reassurance
during her meeting with the press.

“A different type of ice in every
city, different size rinks and
surfaces. She has the spotlight
now, the orchestra, the costumes,

things she never had to deal with
before.” 6

Hamill readily admits that she
needs constant supportvdespite her
successes.

“I have to skate well every single
night now,” says Hamill. “I have
to be as close to my peak as I can
every single night and three times
on Saturday. Before the Olympics,
it was all for just one night.”

But for Hamill, a darling of
American athletics, turning pro-
fessional is still a welcome change.

Pinder ls Fair To
Middling on Solo LP

 

BY TOM WASELESKI

The Promise, Michael Pinder.’
Threshold Records, THS 18.

A What sort of solo album could be
expected of the Moody Blue whose
best writing with the group
consisted of tunes only the caliber
of “Melancholy Man” and “Have
You Heard?”

Would it switch to the high-
powered, heavy sound of drummer
Graeme Edge’s new recording?
Would it carry the sentimentality of
the Moody Blues one step further
and become entrenched in the
same saccharin musings as Ray
Thomas’ solo effort? Or would it
show Pinder to be the same
proponent of “thinking man’s
rock" as Justin Hayward and John
Lodge proved themselves to be in
the phenomenal Bluejays?

Pinder comes out somewhere in .

the middle. Not what could be
touted as a successful LP, but then
not what could be ridiculed as a
flop. He courts out-and-out
mediocrity, writing lyrics with the
old Moodies’ cliches (“...is your

home a distant star?...,” “...I’ve4
travelled this illusion...," “...life
holds many secrets...,” etc.) and

turning out music that lacks both
force and harmony.

While The Promise is not worth
the while (or the money) of casual
Moodies fans, it’s a necessity for
the die-hards, being the last solo
album in this touch-and-go phase
in the group's existence.

The title track is good, Pinder’s
studio band mimicking the old
group's style. He does a fair job of
letting the music heighten the
power of the words, having the
strings rise and fall to “...It’s been
my goal for nine long years to write
this song...so I can say...exactly
what I believe is coming down...”

“Air” is a decentinstrumental
with some hot strumming by
Pinder on his 12-string. Dean Olch
provides some smooth ﬂute work
very reminiscent of old Moody
Blues.

Pinder cuts a tender vocal on
“Message," giving himself a
chance to do the kind of song he
never could with Hayward and
Lodge always sounding more pure,
more romantic. He tries the same
thing on “I Only Want to Love

You,” but this time the ﬂatness of A

his voice is surpassed only by the
grayness of his lyrics.

“You’1l Make It Through” is
carried only by its hot, almost Elton
John hot, piano pounding. “Free
as a Dove” likewise has its
moments, but its surprising time
change at the end, notwithstanding
dissonant gospel singers, shatters

anything the song may have had‘

going for it.

With this ﬁnal solo installment,
Moody Blues buffs can now look
back and ascertain which two
members were the driving force
behind the successful classical-rock
band. Mike Pinder wasn't one of
them.

Georgia Tech head football coach Pepper Rodgers, one of the game's
finest mentors, will need more than his sun hat, Mickey Mouse watch
and glasses to stop the hungry Pitt Panthers, who will travel to Atlanta
to face his Yellow Jackets Saturday night.

BY CRIS HALL

What a difference a victorious
Saturday afternoon in South Bend
can make.

Last week’s Tuesday Pitt football
luncheon at the Greentree Holiday
Inn featured two tight-lipped
coaches and a couple of Panthers
hesitant to make any statements at

all, let alone humorous or bold
ones. P

But yesterday's affair featured
only one tight-lipped mentor—
Georgia Tech's Pepper Rodgers,
via telephone hookup. The players
present, Bob Jury and Don Parrish,
were lively, Parrish tossing out
one-liners and Jury telling every-

one how Notre Dame's offense
didn't impress him.

Even Johnny Majors got into the
act. Pitt's head coach was talking
about how he re-inserted his
first-team defense late in the game
because “they (the Irish) didn’t
deserve a cheap touchdown."

But the afternoon's best remark
came near the end of Majors’
question-and-answer period after
someone asked Major§, who
possesses a vote in United Press
International’s coaches poll,
"Where did you put yourself this
week, coach?" .

“A little higher than what we
finished," answered, Majors. “I
think you have to look out for
yourself."

Pitt was ranked fourth, behind
Michigan, Ohio State and UCLA, in
this week’s UPI poll. The
Associated Press poll, released
Monday night, rated the Panthers
third, behind only Michigan and
Ohio State.

The‘ lofty rankings brought out
the humorous side of Parrish, and
some surprisingly frank comments
by Jury.

When asked to describe the
team's use of the phrase “Poise for
the noise," a slogan designed by
Majors to combat the decible level
at South Bend, Parrish» said the
team didn't use it Saturday
afternoon, partly because they
didn't need it.

“After a while it got to be pretty
quiet out there," the 6-3, 240-
pound ‘defensive tackle from

Tony Dorsett to bring the Outland

proved in Saturday's 31-10 thrash-

unstopable.

Double-teamed throughout the
game, Romano, nonetheless, made
himself a ﬁxture in the Notre Dame
backﬁeld all afternoon, sacking
Irish quarterback Rick Slager twice
and participating in ten other
tackles as well.

Romano would have been a big
factor in the game even if he didn't

relishing the victory over Notre

talent, Romano and his teammates
were not conﬁdent of victory until
the game was in its ﬁnal moments.

“Even though we had a 21-10 lead, V

you always feel they could get
something going,” he said.

Some observers felt that the
blinding Golden Dome and
screaming partisans were never
intended to help an out-of-shape
Irish squad, but Romano didn't see
it that way.

“I don't think they were out of
shape,” he said. “They were a
relatively new offensive line, and it
takes time to get the timing down.

make so many tackles. By being
double-teamed, he gave defensive
tackle Randy Hollaway the freedom
he needed to haul down defensive
player of the game honors.

The presence of Romano's 6-3,
230 lb. frame, flanked by two beefy
Notre Dame linemen, effectively
shut off Notre Dame’s running
game up the middle. even without
Al making a single tackle.

. “That's exactly what happened
on that play where Heavens had

They didn’t give up anything at the

Romano is looking forward to
Saturday's clash at Georgia Tech
with special enthusiasm. He'll be

Tierney, an All-America candidate. ,

Tierney is supposed to be so good
that Romano won't be double-
teamed. This should result in an
extra man in the Yellow Jacket
backﬁeld most of the game. ,,
“It will probably be one of my

toughest games," said Romano.
“I have to work on my timing. It
was a little off in the Notre Dame
game.”

Jury was a bit more serious,
especially when evaluating the
Fighting Irish.

"They (the Irish offensive unit)
were just average,” said Jury, a
starter at cornerback last season
and the ﬁrst-team safety this year.

was a weakness. Ken MacAfee

“Our team has to play better to
avoid being run off the ﬁeld by
Pitt," Rodgers said. And that was
about all he said-——a surprise from
Rodgers, who usually is the life of
the luncheon. He even claimed to
be ignorant of his players’ times in
the 40-yard dash. That's what a
loss can do to a coach.

What a big win can do for a coach
was very evident when Majors rose
to speak. He laughed a lot and

manager, equipped with binocu-

It sure could, given Saturday's
happenings at Notre Dame.

He didn't call the victory his
biggest win as a head coach _(his
first win, against Buffalo, a school
that no longer plays football,
receives that honor), but he did call
it his most important ‘win, given the
circumstances surrounding it.

Majors said he was not sure of
Saturday's win until the ﬁnal few
minutes-——he's never sure, he said,
until his team is up by 17 with less
than two minutes to go.

he wanted to run up the score, he

Now before you think any dirty
thoughts, a point should be
clariﬁed: A horticulturist is one

‘ who is great with plants and their

growth.

How does thispertain to soccer?

Bemis is trying something
different this season—-he’s trying
to make the lagging soccer interest
in Pittsburgh area grow, instead of
plants. So far, Bemis has done
everything from printing hand-out
Panther soccer schedules to pass-

ing Pitt soccer bookmarks all over
Oakland.

But now, Bemis has added a
little more fertilizer to the garden.
He's scsheduled an Irish team from
the University College of Cork,
Ireland, to play his Panthers at Pitt
Stadium on Monday, Sept. 20.

A ﬁnal starting time for the
match hasn't been determined yet,
but Bemis estimated 8:15 or 8:30

But Pitt won't be without their
potential All-Americas on Satur-
day. Head coach ‘Mike Agostinella
claims, that on the starting line at
California State, there will be the
best team to wear the Pitt colors in
many years. That's a hard thing to
say after last year's season, in
which the Panthers were undefeat-
ed in dual meets, won every
invitational in which they ran, took
third in the Central Collegiate
Conference and were invited to the
NCAAs.

Even with the loss of two great
runners—captain Nick Martin and
John Heiser——Coach Agostinella
believes the major asset of this
year's team is depth. He warns of
over-conﬁdence, though, in pursuit
of the team's goal of returning to
the NCAAs in Texas.

“The California Invitational is
the ﬁrst step to the NCAAs,"
Agostinella said. “Since we may
not be invited to the NCAAs until
the end of the season, every meet is
a big one and we shouldn't take
anyone lightly."

This year's team is composed of
20 members, which is surprising,
since cross country is one of the
most grueling sports on campus
along with distance swimming.
Unfortunately for the local fans. all

  ExPantI1er Farley Job Hunting  

BY KAREN KADILAK

Whenever a boy laces up his
football cleats for the first time,
dreams of future gridiron success
can’t help but appear.

Dreams of a successful high
school career, a scholarship to a
major football power, and hopes of
an equally outstanding pro football
career (if he’s lucky, maybe even a
chance to perform for his home-
town pro team) dazzle the mind and
get the adrenaline pumping of
almost any football-aged young-
ster.

Ex-Pitt wide receiver-tight end-
defensive back James Farley,
Panther Class of ’76, had such
dreams. Trouble was, Farley’s
gridiron career was abruptly ended
where he hoped it would begin
ai1ew—the professional ranks.

Farley had the ﬁrst two steps
licked in his dreams. He was even
trying for a third and ﬁnal step this
past summer in the Miami
Dolphins’ training camp in Miami,
only to find the ultimate dream of a
pro football career die to a
nightmarish haze in the thick of the
Florida heat. The 6-3, 230 lb.

that one last hope to lengthen a
career that generally spans the
youthful dreams of a ﬁrst-year
gridder to the painful reality of
being waived by a professional
team, a career in which the
participant has given so much of
himself only to find there’s nothing
to be left as a reward. .

Farley, however, isn’t about to
give up just yet. One chance may
be down, but there may be a few
more to go. ‘

“I haven’t changed my mind,”
the 22-year old Farley said in a
phone conversation from his Miami
home. “I’m staying in shape doing
some special exercises in case
some team does call me.

“I was expecting it _in a way,” he
continued softly. “I have no
regrets either. Really, it will make
me try that much harder. I haven’t
given up football yet.”

There was no doubt Farley had
the right attitude and physical
equipment the minute he stepped
on the field for Northwestern Nigh
School in Miami. In fact, the tall,
slender-looking Farley had enough
of the ingredients to be hounded by

football program there. Farley
moved on to Pitt with Majors.

“I was just starting to get
Majors’ system,” Farley explained
following an afternoon workout at
the Miami training camp at
Biscayne College before he was
waived. “I didn’t want to have to
learn another coach's methods of
doing things, so I thought I’d go
with Majors to Pitt. I knew we
would have a winning football team
there one day just as we had at
Iowa State.”

Farley was listed as a tight
end-wide receiver at Pitt for two
seasons before making the switch

. to defensive backin his senior

campaign. As it turned out,
Majors, as Farley accurately

predicted, did produce a winning
football program and laid the
foundation for continued success in
the years ahead. Fortunately,
Farley tested ‘a big chunk of
winning football at its best when
the Panthers to a Sun Bowl win

‘over highly respected Kansas last

winter.’
The next step in Farley’s
gridiron career came with the

phone call from the Dolphins”

Beathard, who offered Farley a
try-out at the Miami camp when
the former Pitt standout was
bypassed-in the college draft in
April.

obeyed the 11 p.m. curfew. In
other words, he endured the NFL's
version of solitary conﬁnement and
received rave comments from none
other than Shula himself and wide

holding him back, it’s the fact that
he wasn’t drafted. Not only will he
be working against the veterans
but against the drafted players.”

However, the inevitable came
following the Dolphins’ first
pre-season game with Minnesota at
Miami's Orange Bowl. ,

Farley saw very little action in
that contest (he was used as a tight
end the ﬁnal few plays of the game)
and as the ﬁnal seconds of the

so too did Farley's Short stay with

words he, somehow expecting
them, didn’t want to hear.

Bucs lose Again, Meet Phils Tonight

PITTSBURGH (AP)——Ed
Kranepool’s pinch single and an
RBI gounder by Bud Harrelson
drove in two ninth-inning runs that

’ gave the New York Mets a 4-3

victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates
Tuesday» night.

The loss, Pittsburgh’s second
straight to New York, dropped the
Pirates six games behind Phila-
delphia in the National League East
race Philadelphia beat Montreal
3-2.

The Pirates tied the game 2-2 on
Rennie Stnnett’s solo homer, his
second of the season, in the
seventh inning, then went ahead in
the eighth. Omar Moreno singled,
stole second, went to third on a
groundout and scored on Dave
Parker’s grounder.

In the ninth, Dave Kingman got
his ﬁrst hit of the two-game series,
a one-out single. John Stearns
followed with a single to ‘left,
Kingman going to third. Krane-

\ pool singled to center for the tying

run before Harrelsdn hit a ﬁel'der’s

Pitt News

“Time’s running out on us,”
Rooker said after the Pirates
second straight loss.

The Pirates and Phillies meet
tonight and Thursday night in
Philadelphia in their last two head
on encounters this season.

“Our hands are full, but they’ve
been full all year,” said Rooker,
who yielded two runs in the
ninth-inning, including the un-
earned winning run.

Before their last two defeats, the
Pirates had won 15 of 17 games to
surge back from what had been a
15‘/2-game Philadelphia lead.

“It adds some excitement to the
race when a third—place team can
have something to say about who
the East Division winner may be,”

Pittsburgh led 3-2 into the
ninth-inning against the Mets, but
they scored their last two runs on a
pinch single by Ed Kranepool and
an RBI-grounder by Bud Harrel-
son.

“When you go into the ninth
with a one-run lead, that’s the type
of game you have to win.” said
Pirate Manager Danny Murtaugh.

The Pirates started the scoring in
the third when Moreno beat out an
inﬁeld hit, stole second and rode

home on Richie Zisk’s long single
to center ﬁeld.

But the Mets were back in front

in the top of the fourth. John
Milner walked with one out and Joe
Torre hit a 2-1 pitch over the left
ﬁeld fence for his ﬁfth homer of the
season. ‘
~ The Pirates had threatened in
the second when they loaded the
bases on two walks and a single but
Craig Swan pitched out of it by
striking out Duffy Dyer and getting
Jim Rooker to lift a fly to center
ﬁeld.

Men-y Victories For Spikers

BY JOHN FINN

Herbert and Schall.

No, you never saw these two
names in Sports Illustrated. In
fact, you probably never read about
them in Volleyball Magazine
either-that is, if you ever read it in

» the ﬁrst place.

But if all goes well this year for
the Pantherette volleyball team,
you will be hearing a lot about
Herbert and Rich Schall, the new
head coaches of the talented
spikers. And both men are rich in
volleyball ability and experience.

Herbert, who will assume the
head coaching duties at Pitt, spent
most of his playing career at the
best place of all, the University of
California at Santa Barbara, the
U.C.L.A. of collegiate volleyball.
Currently, he is playing for the

   

  

Genesee Volleyball Club of Pitts-
burgh. I

Herbert's assistant will be a man
who also possesses a very credible
volleyball background. With a

short and stocky frrame, Schall

bears little resemblance to a
volleyball player, until he steps on
the court. Superior leaping ability
and a smooth overall technique
enable him to lead his high school
team to the 1964 state volleyball
championship.

Recently, skillfull handling of his ‘

players earned him second-place
ﬁnishes in the WesternVPennsyl-
Vania Interscholastic Athletic
League in 1975 and 1976 as coach
of Derry Area High School. _

Both men are looking forward to
the pleasant challenge of coaching
the women’s volleyball team—a
squad which has been quite

successful since its inception only
three years ago.

They are enthusiastic despite the
loss of their three best spikers——
Mitzi Frye, Debbie Jones and Julie
Richter. Yet their optimism is not
without justiﬁcation.

Herbert , said he was quite
pleased with the team's initial
workout on Saturday.’ He plans to
implement the 6-0 offense, a highly

potent and .,very popular attack,

before the Pantherettes open at
Ashland on Oct. 2.

And what about two young men
coaching a women’s team? Well,
the women seem pretty enthusias-
tic about it and are looking forward
to the start of the season.

As Herbert said, “It should be a
very interesting season.”

And if all goes well, a very
successful season too.

Pitt Hoeing For A Win

The Pitt Soccer team will kick off another home
soccer season as the Panthers try to pot St. Vincent
tonight at Pitt Stadium. The young Pitt squad [0-1]"

(Continued from 1249,19)

In other words, you can bet your
six-pack that this is an especially
high caliber team.

But before we start replanting
the soccer schedule, let’s get back
to the game, at hand—a 7 p.m.
game today with St. Vincent at Pitt
Stadium. This should be a true test
for how Bemis’ pruning of young
talent has affected the Panthers’
1976 outlook.

After being chopped off at the
stalk by Akron 5-1 last Saturday,
Pitt (0-1) needs this win to get back
on the right track.

“A good game will give us
conﬁdence,” Bemis said. “We
need conﬁdence with Davis and
Elkins coming up next Saturday."’

_Conﬁdence will be hard to come
by, though. St. Vincent is so huge,
it’s waterboy- is an ex-Chicago
Bears linebacker. , .

Parseghian Still
loyal To Irish

BY HEIISCHEL NISSENSON
AP Sports Writer

SOUTH BEND, Ind.—Last Sat-
urday, Ara Parseghian rose early,
as usual. .

“My ﬁrst thought was that Notre
D_ame was playing a football game
and S we had to win," he said.

“Then I realized it's not my
responsibility any more.”
The next morning, following

Notre Dame's 31-10 loss to Pitt,

Parseghian went out and hit a few
golf balls, attended a social brunch
and flew to Miami to make a
speech.

Saturday he served as color
commentator for ABC’s telecast of
the Notre Dame—Pitt game, an offer
he refused a year ago.

“It was difﬁcult because I spent
11 years coaching at Notre Dame,"
he said. “I don't think I'd have
been able to do a Notre Dame game
last year.

- “I tried to be objective about the
game." Parseghian said. although
it's doubtful he found many good
things to say about a 31-10 loser.
“I didn’t really criticize. The
interceptions were obviously the
turning point. and I said so. but
I've never been one to rip anybody:
it's not my nature. lgucs I'm more
understanding of coaches’ pro-
blems."

“They have a big team,” agreed
Bemis. “Very physical.”
St. Vincent used this physical

edge to wipe up Geneva 2-0 last
week. Pitt also beat Geneva, a 4-0
practice- scrimmage, but won
without the horror of defending
against Geneva’s star forward.

Not only is St. Vincent's strength
a big factor, but their attitude as
well. Here is a small college trying
to compete against a big college.
They’ll obviously be super-psyched
to beat Pitt.

Discover. . . . .

needs this match to ready itself for a tough weekend
. against Davis and Elkins and the University College
of Cork, Ireland.

Harper photo

But the Panthers are psyched,
too. All young teams out to prove
they are winners are psyched
before every game, especially their
home opener, no matter if it is
against St. Vincent or Notre Dame.
And despite the Akron loss, this
team——led by All-America candi-
date goalie Frank Bucci and a bevy
of ﬂowering talent—-has a positive
winning attitude toward tonight’s
game. If this attitude ripens into
reality, Pitt could make the
Hanging Gardens of Babylon look
like a corn ﬁeld.

No Joking, Tom Brzoza
Hus All-America Hopes

BY BOB EVANS

Tom Brzoza, Pitt’s right offen-
sive guard and a solid All-America
prospect. has this crazy dream
bouncing around in his head.

Or is it crazy?

“I don't really mind being an
offensive lineman,” the said, “but
it's just that the coaches haven't
discovered my real potential yet.

“With my 4.6 breakaway speed,
I‘m a natural running back,” he
said, while his 6-2, 240-lb. frame
lay sprawled across the bed.
Fighting back a grin, he went on.

“I hate to brag, but if I get my
chance, maybe they’ll find out
they’ve got a better runner than
Tony ,(Dorsett.)"

Such—and let's call them unlik-
ely-—stories are part of Brzoza’s
personality, a mixture of mischief
and sensitivity. Both qualities
showed again when he was asked
how he could be so docile off the
ﬁeld and so roughshod on it.

“All of us football players get
automatically stereotyped as ani-
mals. Well, for myepart, it’s not
true. In fact, I happen to feel that
I'm one of the more civilized people
in the world.” -

The talented junior from Nes-
hannock High School ﬂashed a big
grin, then explained, “Hell, I’m
easygoing on the ﬁeld too. It’s just
that...well...there’re some things
you ‘gotta do in life, and taking my
man out of a play is one of them.”

Brzoza goes about that task with
a variety of skills, foremost of
which are his quickness and
excellent technique.

“You don't have to knock a guy
flat every play, just get him out of
the way. And our backs don't need
much time to get through.”

One of those backs, whose
initials are T.-D., has put together
some pretty fair records‘ and it was
asked if Brzoza took a measure of
pride in Dorsett’s accomplish-
ments.

“Actually, I think l’ll realize it
more at some later time in my life.
Now, it's just something that's
happening,” he said, “and the
whole impact probably won’t be
realized for a long time.

“Then I can look back and see
just how great a runner Tony
Dorsett was."

Brzoza excused himself and put
on a Boz Scaggs album, then

exp1ained——with a mischievous -

twinkle—that one of his cohorts on
the offensive line was responsible
for his being a Pitt Panther.

“John Pelusi played such an
amazing role in recruiting me, I
couldn't possibly have gone any-
where else,” he said.

Brzoza then showed his serious
side when he said football had
become somewhat like a job to him.

“Yeah, it’s like working. Mostly
because of all the time you’ve got

to put into it. And like most things, ,

sometimes it can be a pain.”
And particularly painful to
opposing linemen.
