’ I ran head’ Heyward  

arrested for third time

By Marc Duchin

News Editor -

The recent arrest of Pitt Panther
football player Craig Heyward
marks the third time Heyward has
had police charges filed against
him in the past two years.

Heyward was arrested‘ on
Saturday night and charged with
simple assault of a police officer,
resisting arrest and disorderly
conduct after refusing to leave the
scene of a shooting at a Phi Beta
Sigma fraternity party held in the
William Pitt Union assembly
room.

”The two incidents [the shoot-
ing and Heyward's arrest] are not
related,” said Walt Waters, direc-
tor of Pitt's campus police.

Heyward has been released on
nominal bond and is scheduled
to attend a city court hearing on

1 Thursday.

Heyward was first arrested by

campus police in January at 1985
and charged with aggravated as-
sault and simple assault of two
Pitt students on his dormitory
floor. He was later released on his
own recognizance and tried by
the Juducial Board. A

In March of 1985, Dr. Conney
Kimbo, vice president of student
affairs, sentenced Heyward to a
one-year probation period and
ruled him ineligible to play in the
1985 football season.

Heyward was later charged
and fined for simple assault and
harrassment of a 12-year-old
paperboy in March of 1986.

Linda Venzon, assistant sports
information director, declined to
comment on the recent Heyward
arrest.

Craig Heyward could not be
reached for comment. Head foot-
ball coach Mike Gottfried and
Athletic Director Edward Bozik
were also unavailable for
comment.

Campus police to
increase manpower

By Julie Shepard
Assistant News Editor

Because of the shooting inci-
dent in the William Pitt Union
and several other incidents’ that
occurred this past weekend, the

campus police will be increasing,

their manpower this weekend
and for the weeks to come.

Walt Waters, assistant director
of public safety, said that he will
”have to see what happens this
weekend but will also have more
manpower out in the area.

”The shooting in the Union,
the Heyward incident, a minor
assault near Pennsylvania Hall
and a fight in Tower A all seemed
to come at once. Our men, [the
campus" police] were really
spread out over campus,” said
Waters. ”This weekend, though,
we will be prepared.

”An ‘Impact Detail’ — a group

of six extra officers — was put on .

duty in the Fallof 1986. Because
they weren't needed, however,
the group was disbanded. As of
September, 1987, however, the

detail was put back into effect. 9

’’In September, when. the
weather was warm, large groups
of people were all over Oakland.
All our men could really do was
move them around,” said
Waters. ”Once the cold weather
set in, we were hoping that the
assaults and reports would
decrease. They did over Christ-
mas when everyone went home,
but they are starting to build up
again now that students are

back/’-

Waters stated that it was too
early to determine whether or not
Oakland would continue to be a
problem.

”With the many activities that
occurred over this most recent
weekend — the game, the frater-
nity party and the ‘many people
just out on the streets — a lot was
going on in the area,” Waters
said. ”After this weekend,
though, we will be able to tell if
there really is a problem or not.

”We have a total of 54 campus
police,” said Waters. ”During the
weekends, 16 or 17 of these
officers are on duty plus the ex-
tra .six on Impact Detail. These
officers are spread throughout
Oakland along with officers sent
in from the city squad. The city

police also have an impact Detail ,

on duty as of December of 1987.
We're hoping that with these
officers and a little more informa-
tion on the activities going on in
the Union, we can prevent any
more incidents like we had to

deal with Friday and Saturday.”-

Waters said he feels that a lot
of the.trouble in the Oakland area
is caused by people other than
Pitt students. ”Oak|and seems to
be the only place for young peo-
ple to come on the._ weekends,”
said Waters. ”Many high school
kids’ come into town and try to

get into collegefunctions. When -

you try to chase them out,

"though, they only go somewhere V

else in Oakland. "

Victim of Greensburg crash
serious condition

ll sted I n
ByMark R. Brown
Staff Writer

Two Pitt students are still in
intensive care following an
auto accident last Thursday
that claimed the life of Pitt stu-
dent Daniel Churchman.

Michael Kossey’s condition
was upgraded Monday from
critical to serious. He is
presently in Presbyterian
Hospital.

Mercy Hospital would not
comment on the condition of
Michael Bohinski, although
his last listing was critical.

According to the West-
morel_and County Coroner Leo
M. Bacha, ”An autopsy’ per-
formed on Daniel Churchman
showed a lot of alcohol in his
blood, precisely .24, which is
almost two and a half times
the legal definition of intoxica-
tion. The auto that he was

high rate of speed, between 60
and 70 miles per hour. The
cause of death was massive
trauma.” —

The director of'Safety an
Security at Pitt's Greensburg
campus, Charles Westbrooks,
said, ’’It is not true that they
were attending a party on
campus. The three men were
visiting a friend, Larry Miller,
who resides at the Crestview
Apartments about one and a
half miles from campus. After
visiting Miller, the three drove
down Mount Pleasant Road
and failed to negotiate a turn
in the road. They struck a tree
about a half block from
campus."

”Students from campus
heard the accident and came
out running. Two of the first
people on the scene of the ac-
cident were Larrv Miller and

‘reports, the three men in the

Officer McClane of campus
security,” said Westbrooks.

”Everyone up here was
devastated by the accident.
On a small campus, every-
body knows each other,” said
Westbrooks.

”Contrary to previous
accident had transferred to the
Oakland campus last fall,’’
said Westbrooks.

According to altrooper from
the State Police Barracks in
Greensburg, ”Danie| Church-
man was the driver of the ve-
hicle. The front part of the
vehicle continued down the
road for 49 feet after impact.
The high level of alcohol
found in the blood of the de-
ceased would indicate that
they were drinking in the
Greensburg area in addition to
if they were drinking in
Pittsburgh.”

Israeli settlers kill Arab protestor in Gaza Strip

BETIN, Occupied West Bank

  Judge orders Amoco

to pay $85.2 million

CHICAGO — A federal judge
Monday ordered Amoco Corp. to
pay $85.2 million for damages
from the wreck of the supertanker
Amoco Cadiz, which spilled 68
million gallons of oil off the Brit-
tany coast nearly a decade ago.

U'.S. District Judge Frank
McGarr, who ruled in 1984 that
Chicago—based Amoco was liable
for the March 16, 1978, spill,
heard more than a year of expert
testimony before determining
damages in the second phase of

the trial.

Besides France, the plaintiffs in-
cluded 90 villages, associations
of oystermen and fishermen, en-
vironmentalists and property
owners, and a small third group
of plaintiffs.

McGarr said $39.7 million of
the award was interest. -

He said that by today's ex-
change rates,»the damage figure
amounted to 252,837,825 francs.

The French state sought $466
million in damages, while the 90
plaintiffs sought $695 million at
current exchange rates, attorneys
said. —

Fed bill contains tax

break for automakers

DETROIT — The federal spend-
ing bill originally designed for an
Illinois farm equipment maker
could mean a huge tax break for
the nation's automakers, accord-
ing to published reports.

Auto industry sources quoted
by The Washington Post in its
Saturday‘ editions estimated that
a.provision in the spending bill
will save the Big Three carmak-
ers about $2 billion. A source

quoted by the Detroit News to-
day put the savings at more than
$1 billion.

The omnibus spending bill
passed just before Christmas con-
tains clarifying language inserted
by House Ways and Means Com-
mittee Chairman Dan
Rostenkowski, D-lll., at the au-
tomakers’ request.

The provision clarifies that a
vaguely worded loophole in the
1986 tax reform act applies‘ to
General Motors Corp., Ford Mo-
tor Co. and Chrysler Corp. as well
as its original beneficiary, farm

equipment maker Deere & Co. of

Moline, Ill.

The tax reform act provision
gives advantages to manufac-
turers selling to dealers on an in-
stallment plan.

Another Soviet try

for better relations

For the first time since 1969, a Sovietleader hasimade over-
tures of friendship toward the Chinese government. In an in-
terview published in a popular Chinese meeting, Gorbachev
talked about his interest in reopening relations with China, as
well as a proposed withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan
by the end of the year. -

At this point, the plans for such a meeting are only in the
formative stages, but it seems that there is at least interest on
both sides. There are, however, some questions pertaining to
restrictions put on future talks by previous Chinese leaders.

One such condition is the withdrawal of Soviet troops from
Afghanistan, an action the Chinese have opposed since its be-
ginning.;Other conditions include the cessation of Soviet sup-
port of the Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia and a reduction
of Soviet forces on China's northern border.

It would appear that Gorbachev is truly interested in reopen-
ing relations on a, number of fronts, even if that action requires
a change in some key Soviet policies. The willingness on the
part of the Soviets to alter policies in the interest of better rela-
tions is a trait that would wear well on many of our current
leaders. . ‘

Looking back on
civil rights progress

Monday marked the opening of the Martin Luther King Com-
munity Learning week, which, incidentally, runs for two weeks.

. Over the next couple of weeks, there will be a number of ac-
y tivities commemorating the life of the assassinated civil rights

leader. - '

Sadly, even 20 years after his death, no one can say that the
problems of racial discrimination have disappeared. Last year,
events in Howard Beach, N.Y., turned the eyes of the country
to our continuing problems of racial inequality. More recent-

ly, events in Oakland have highlighted the continuing incidence

of racism in this city. »

Twenty years ago, the country was in the throes of one of
the most massive cultural upheaveals of the century. Even this
week, popular magazines such as Time are still trying to sort
out the implications and effects of that time. One of the major
leaps forward of that time came in the area of increased minority
rights. For the first time in American politics, a wide spectrum
of political figures were paying heed to the notion that all
citizens should have equal rights and equal opportunities.

King had a vision, a dream, to paraphrase one of his most
famous sentiments. In his time, a dream was about the best thing
possible. Since then, we have made a good bit of progress, but
the transformation from a prejudicial and hating society to one
that fosters understanding between and within the races is a
slow process.

Some people, like King and John Lennon, are natural lead-
ers. They are the people who are willing to take chances to
see their goals realized. Not everyone is willing to devote their
life's work to promoting peace, which is not necessarily a
problem. We should all remember, though, that actively refus-
ing to further prejudice, that doing nothing more than work-
ing to eliminate personal prejudices, is just as necessary. With
a little help from all of us, that dream justmight become reality.

ry‘, guys, I really enjoy your com-
passion and your attempts to
include me in your world, but
how about my world?

Does and will anybody really
listen to what I have to say, or am
I just ”spouting off” again?

All I'm looking for is for peo-
ple to appreciate me for what I
am and what I can do.

So how about it girls? Do you

And, of even more importance,
how about_you guys? Most of the

How many guys are still stuck
on the terms ”babe, fox, bitch,

How many guys think they’re

”king of the hill” and need to
prove that to everyone else?

And how many guys think they
can take advantage of women be-
cause they are the ”inferior” sex?

I think it's time for everyone to
realize that if a woman wants to
wear a dress, no one should dis-
count the possibility that she's
wearing that dress just because
she wants to make her own per-
sonal statement. True, every
woman's statement is different,
but I think it's pretty unfair to just
assume that she's wearing it in
hopes that every man in passing
will look at her legs.

Believe it or not, I know that I
really sound like the true feminist.
However, there is a confession I
must make. I love equality, I love

for what I do and who I am. I also
love to have doors opened for

THE PITT NEWS, Tuesday, January I2, I988

Reagan speaks on trade deficit    

By Susanne M. Schafer

Associated Press Writer

CLEVELAND —.-President Rea-
gan said -Monday that the nation's
huge trade deficit and big foreign
capital investments in the United
States ”are not necessarily a sign
of an economy's weakness” and
can even be desirable.

In a speech to the City Club of
Cleveland, Reagan said that trade

deficits should be reduced over»

time but that the United States
has a big imbalance now ”be-
cause our growing economy ena-
bles us to buy their goods” from
other countries. I

The trade deficit is one of the
factors blamed for unease on

"Wall Street and the nosedive in

stock prices. New trade figures
are due to be announced later
this week.

In his prepared remarks, Rea-
gan made no mention of the

stock market's jitters or of a report
he received last week that
blamed Black ‘Monday's
508-point collapse on computer-
ized trading by a handful of the
nation's largest institutional in-
vestors.

Instead, he painted a rosy pic-
ture of the economy, noting that
14 million jobs have been creat-

‘ ed during his administration and

saying that new business crea-
tions are strong and manufactur-
ing productivity is registering
historic gains.

While the influx of foreign cap-
ital and the big trade deficit have
caused concern on the-markets,
Reagan offered a different
outlook.

”Trade deficits and inflows of
foreign capital are not necessari-
ly a sign of an economy's weak-
ness,” he said. Indeed, he said,

. one might argue ”it’s a sign of

strength” and that ”up to a point
[it is] desirable.”

Reagan also steered clear of the
political debate over whether
Vice President George Bush
should reveal whatever advice he
gave Reagan about the Iran-
Contra affair.

”Everybody knows everything
about |ran—Contra,” Reagan said
when reporters asked if he would
release Bush from any pledge of
secrecy about the matters they
discussed. I

Reagan spoke at a Cleveland
airport as he was about to duck
into his limousine to travel down-
town for his speech.

Earlier, presidential spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater said Reagan
would not become involved in
the debate between Bush and
Bush's rival for the Republican
presidential nomination, Sen.
Bob Dole of Kansas. Dole and
other GOP candidates have been
pressing the vice president to re-
veal everything about the Iran-
Contra affair.

Stargell tries to join baseball elite at ’Hall’  

By Ben Walker

AP Baseball Writer

NEW YORK — Pitchers could
not stop him, and only the first-
ballot jinx may prevent Willie
Stargell from being elected Tues-
day to baseball’s Hall of Fame.

Stargell, a leader on and off the
field throughout his career,
hoped to become the 17th play-
er to be enshrined on the first try.
Voting results were to be an-

nounced at 11 p.m. EST by the
Baseball Writers Association of
America.

”Just the words ’Hall of Fame’
give me chills,” Stargell said. ’’It’s
almost impossible to think it
could happen to you.”

Stargell seems certain for
Cooperstown, probably this year.
Jim Bunning, who came close in
last year's election, appeared the
only other among 45 candidates
with a chance.

’ Orlando Cepeda, Roger Maris
and Tony Oliva all fell short last
year of being named on 75 per-
cent of the 400—plus ballots. Luis
Tiant and Sparky Lyle join Star-
gell as first—year contenders.

Willie McCovey was the last
player to make it on his first try.
He hit 521 home runs and was
elected in 1986.

Stargell hit 475 homers with
1,540 RBI and a .282 career aver-
age in 21 seasons with the Pitts-

burgh Pirates. His last full season
was 1979, which he capped off
by becoming Most Valuable Play-
er in the’Pirates’ World Series vic-
tory over Baltimore. He also
shared the National League's
MVP award that year with Keith
Hernandez.

Stargell led the the NL with 48
home runs in 1971 and joined

Gore's 21 points
spark Pitt to easy
85-58 victory

_ By John Enright

Editor in Chief

The Pitt Panthers got their run-
ning game going early, put it in
cruise control and coasted to an
85-58 victory over Duquesne at
Fitzgerald Field House last night.
4 The Panthers ran up a 17-0 lead
with seniors Demetreus Gore and
Charles Smith combining for 15
points. The Dukes got no closer
than eight points the rest of the
night.

”We came out and played hard ‘

the first five minutes. Our defense
worked hard. We made some
steals, made them rush shots and
that set the tone for the offense,"
Smith said.

”We came out strong and that
was a good sign. We have to
work on keeping our intensity up
for 40 minutes," added Gore.

Forward Darrell White scored
on a layup to give the Dukes their
first basket at the 14:42 mark.

The win moved Pitt (ranked
sixth by the Associated Press) to
11-1 on the season. Duquesne,
which has lost nine straight
against the Panthers, fell to 5-9.

Pitt's win tied the all-time ser-
ies, 28-28.

The Panthers were in control
the whole way, but after their ear-
ly run, played lackluster ball the
rest of the half. Duquesne was
able to keep the score respecta-
ble, cutting Pitt.’s lead to 30-22 at
the 6:44 mark.

’’I’d rather play a little bit more
[steady] and have that big spurt
the last five minutes,” Pitt Coach
Paul Evans said.

Pitt led at halftime, 49-3 7, and
Evans, never one to be easily
pleased, had some harsh words

for his squad in the locker room.

What did Evans have to say?
”You don't want to know. He
was upset,” Gore said.

Gore had 18 points, including
two 3—pointers, while Smith ad-
ded 13 in the first half.

Pitt outscored Duquesne 21-12
the first 12 minutes of the second
half to open a 21-point lead,
70-49. ~

Evans substituted freely the rest
of the game and even seldom-
us.ed center Steve Maslek
chipped in with four points.
Everyone on Pitt's roster got in

the game except walk-on Scott V

Colombo, who has a fractured
finger.

Evans said the game was a
good break for the Panthers from
the rugged Big East schedule,
even though they didn't play with
the intensity evident in last
week's games against St. John's
and Georgetown.

’’I think it's good to break [the
Big East schedule] up. I think the
kids get sick of playing Big East
games night after night," he said.

Evans didn't seem overly con-
cerned with Pitt’s lack of intensi-
ty. ‘'1 don't think you can play
[hard] 28 games. Everybody said
[Pitt forward] Jerome [Lane]
played like a dog, but he's played
with so much intensity the last
three games. If he's going to have
an off-night, I wanted him to have
it tonight.”

A Lane finished the game with 12
points and eight rebounds. He
was six of six from the foul line,
and now has made 11 straight
free throws. He entered the game
hitting only 49 percent of his fre
throws. 1

Payton’s career closes with [playoff loss

By Hal Bock
AP Sports Writer

CHICAGO — He was the last
man to reach the losing Chicago
locker room, arriving well after
most of his teammates had
stripped out of their uniforms and
gone to the showers.

Walter Payton made his way to
the corner locker, the one
without the number over it. After
13 years, after 16,726 yards, af-

ter a Hall-of-Fame career, his
locker needed no number.

Payton slumped in the corner,
his helmet still on. He leaned
back against the wall and closed
his eyes for what seemed an eter-
nity after Washington eliminated
the Bears from the NFL playoffs,
21-17.

Perhaps he was replaying the
last time he handled the football
for the Bears. Trying for a mira-
cle with no timeouts left and the

clock evaporating, Chicago faced
a fourth-down-and-8 at their own
36. Jim McMahon's swing pass "to
Payton picked up seven yards.
After rushing for more yards
than any man in NFL history and
gaining 85 yards Sunday to lead
all runners in the NFC semifinal
playoff against Washington, Pay-
ton had come up one yard short.
One yard. 3
There was the usual shuffle of

tape and pads, discarded at the .

end of the game. For Payton,
however, this was the end of a
career, the greatest running back
career in NFL history. And he was
in no hurry.

Finally, he opened his eyes and
looked at his hands.

Again, he closed his eyes and
leaned his head back against the
wall, his helmet tapping it softly.
He opened his eyes slowly, as if

the lids weighed tons. He leaned .-
forward, hands on chin, looking,

like a living version of Rodin's
sculpture, ”The Thinker."
Calvin Thomas, dressing near-

by, noticed Payton still in full ’

gear. He walked over.‘ ”You

OK?” he said to the top ground-

gainer in NFL history.

’’I'm fine,” Payton said’. ’’I’m
just taking my time. It's my last
time taking it off.”

Thomas smiled and shook Pay-

ton’s hand.

Charles Smith's two early dunks got Pitt rolling in the win over Duquesne.

dominant

Smith continues his

play over

cross-town Dukes

By Matt Martin

Assistant Sports Editor

Charles Smith continued his
personal dominance of the Du-
quesne Dukes in last night's
85-58 Pitt victory.

Smith scored 17 points,
grabbed 11 rebounds, blocked
four shots, dished out two assists,
and played hounding defense as
the Panthers won their ninth
straight game against the Dukes.

In the previous three games
against Duquesne, Smith aver-
aged 22 points, 14 rebounds, five
blocks and shot 60 percent from
the field.

Smith went 6 for 11 from the

‘field last night and was 5 of 5

from the free throw line.

”I try to come out and play
hard every night,” Smith said of
his intensity level. Many thought
the Panthers would have a tough
time getting up for this non-
conference game against the be-
leaguered Dukes.

”We came to play and it
showed in the first four or five
minutes because those minutes

set the tone for the game,” Smith

said. _

Pitt got out to a 17-0 lead early
in the first half as Smith scored
seven points, including two
dunks

But the tone changed later in
the half, when Smith, on an at-
tempted aI|ey—oop from point
guard Sean Miller, was undercut
by Duquesne’s Darrell White.

Smith took exception to the
foul and nearly came to fisticuffs
with White before the officials
stepped in. ”It’s no big deal,”
Smith said. ”|t’s part ofthe game.
Things like that will happen. Peo-
ple are going to do everything to
get me out of the game.” That
was evidenced by Duquense’s 23
personal fouls to only 14 for the
Panthers.

The second half carried the
same ill—boding for Duquesne as
the first, and when it was over,
Smith had 300 career blocks to

T his name, a Pitt record he has

held for quite some time. ”With
theblocked shots, we’ve been

playing a lot of man-to-man.

defense, and I sag in around the
paint,” Smith said. ‘

A quicklook at the Pittsburgh sports scene

By Vince Longo
Staff Writer

Over the past several years, it
would not have been surprising
if the average sports fan in Pitts-
burgh had developed somewhat
of an inferiority complex. The
Pirates had finished in last place
for three years in a row and-were
rocked by a drug trial. The Pitt
football team did what this report-
er thought could never happen
and finished well below .500 at
3-7-1, followed by consecutive
years at 5-5-1. The Steelers’ sea-
sons had been a blazing pano-
rama of mediocrity, at best. Pitt
basketball had been very healthy
but had not fulfilled the high ex-

‘pectations people had of them.

And, oh yes, the Penguins had
continually failed to reach their
lofty goal of being one of 16

Finally, the helmet came off

hundreds, perhaps thousands of
times. Methodically, he stripped
off the tools of this tough business
of football.

When he came to the thigh

this is utterly ridiculous, please

THE PITT NEWS, Tuesday, January I2, i988

 

By Jim O'Connell

CAP Basketball Writer

Arizona returned to the top of
the College basketball poll Mon-
day as the number.of undefeated
teams dwindled to three with one
still unranked.

The Wildcats, 14-1, had been
No. 1 for two weeks before los-
ing at New Mexico last week and

' fell to third. Kentucky had

replaced Arizona as No. 1 and
had been in the top spot for the
two weeks before Arizona took
over, but it lost 53-52 at home to
Auburn on Saturday and dropped

- to fifth in the rankings.

Arizona received 25 first-place
votes and 1,181 points from the

nationwide panel of sportswriters I

and broadcasters, while North
Carolina, 11-1, jumped from
fourth to second with 11 first-
place votes and 1,100 points,
seven more than Oklahoma,
which received 16 first-place
votes.

Oklahoma, 14-0, and Temple,
10-0, which was next with 1,001

points, are two of the three re-
maining unbeaten Division I
teams. Brigham Young, 11-0, is
the other, but the Cougars
finished 22nd in the voting this
week.

Pittsburgh, 10-1, which was
ranked second but lost to George-
town last week in its Big East

‘opener, fell to sixth with 949

points,‘ 31 less than Kentucky,
while Duke, which received
three first-place votes and 879
points, jumped from ninth to
seventh with a 9-1 record. The
only loss suffered by the Blue
Devils was to Arizona by six
points in the championship game

. of the Fiesta Bowl Classic.

Purdue, which also jumped
two places, was eighth at 13-1
with 842 points, 18 more than
Syracuse, 12-2, which fell from
seventh despite winning its only
two games last week, Big East vic-
tories over Boston College and
Seton Hall.

Michigan, 13-1, improved one
place to round out the Top 10,
receiving 730 points.

Georgetown, 11-1, leads the
Second 10, with 606 points fol-
lowed by Wyoming, Nevada-Las
Vegas, Iowa State, Indiana, Kan-
sas, Iowa, New Mexico, Auburn
and Illinois.

Wyoming dropped from fifth to
12th after suffering its first two
losses of the year, road games at
Texas-El Paso, 68-62, and New
Mexico, 85-72.

New Mexico, 14-3, and Au-
burn, 9-2, whose victories over
ranked teams caused all the
movement in the poll, are the
newcomers to the Top 20, replac-
ing Florida and St. John's.

New Mexico's losses this sea-
son have been to Seton Hall,
Iowa State and Washington,
while Auburn fell to Illinois and
Georgia Tech.

Florida, 10-4, lost to Auburn
72-67 in between victories over
Towson State and Georgia. The
Gators, who had been ranked
each week since being 14th in
the preseason poll, had been as
high as seventh.

Gore led Pitt with 21 points
and now has scored 39 points in
the past two games. ”We’ve been
waiting for [Demetreus] to score,
but I think all our kids are capa-
ble of scoring more,” Evans said.

Smith had 17 points, 11 re-
bounds and four blocked shots.
Freshman guard Jason Matthews

. added 11 points for the Panthers.

Duquesne was led by Brian
Shanahan with 14 points. Collins
Dobbs and White had 11 each.

The only real excitement in the
first half besides Pitt's early run
(which included two dunks by
Smith) was a square off between
the Panthers’ center and White
with 3:28 remaining.

White undercut Smith whowas
going up for a shot after receiv-
ing an alley-oop pass. The two

exchanged words, but one of the pp 

officials intervened before any
punches were thrown.

Earlier in the half Smith had
thrown a punch (and missed)

‘ while he was running down the

court alongside White.

Meanwhile the fans seemed
just as excited about the Villano-
va 80, Syracuse 78 score which
was flashed on the scoreboard.

Smith, for one, was glad to see
Syracuse lose, but he's keeping it
in perspective. ”That’s not going-
to help us a whole helluva lot if
we don't come to play hard.ev-
ery night.”

And on this night, the Panthers

THE PITT NEWS, Tuesday, January 12, I988

 

Mattingly stays with
Yanks, promises wins

By Hal Bock
AP Sports Writer-

NEW YORK — Don Mat-
tingly, who was challenged by
George Steinbrenner to lead
the New York Yankees to a
pennant last year, signed a
three—year contract for $6.7
million Monday and boasted
that he could guarantee that
flag.

’’I feel we're the best club in
baseball right now,” Matting-
Iy said. ”I’ve felt this way all
winter. We're going to win the
American League East. We're
the best club- There's not a
club out there that can beat
us.” .

Then Mattingly added the
phrase that made Joe Namath
famous before Super Bowl III:
'’’I guarantee it.”

Mattingly won a $1,975,000
contract in arbitration last
year, and Steinbrenner said
that kind of salary_meant the
first baseman would have to
lead the team to the pennant.
The Yankees contended ‘for
much of the season before fad-
ing and finishing fourth as
Mattingly batted .327 with 30
home runs and 115 runs bat-

ted in. - ‘

thing as far as what he ex-
pects,” Mattingly said. ’’I’m
sure he expects me to do my
job and the kinds of things I've
done for four or five seasons.
I expect to do a major part, to
the best of my ability. I owe it
to them to go out and be the
best player I can be. I've al-
ways felt I owed that to myself.

’’I don't feel like I can carry

”George hasn't said any— 

a team. I can't do it all. I do my
job day in, day out. My job is
to be consistent. I need to be
the guy who gets on base, and
I need to be the guy driving in
the runs. I feel like I need to
be in both places.”

Mattingly was enthusiastic
about the Yankees’ signing last
week of free agent Jack Clark.

”He’ll get me better pitches
to hit,” Mattingly said. ”He
gives you more protection as
a hitter. They've got to pitch to
me because they won't want
to pitch to him. His addition
hopefully means all kinds of
trouble for other teams.”

Mattingly said terms of the
deal had been agreed on for
some time, but the contract
had been delayed while the
Yankees sought to insure the
deal because of the first base-
man’s back problems. He
missed 21 games last season.

’’If they couldn't get insur-
ance, they didn’t want to
guarantee the contract,” Mat-
tingly said. ”It’s just good bus-
iness. They're covered.”

Mattingly said his back had
not given him any trouble dur-
ing the off-season and that he
does daily exercises.

The first baseman tied two
major league records last sum-
mer, hitting home runs in eight
consecutive games from July 8
through 18 and then, two days
later, making 22 putouts at first
base.

He is the second player to
receive a three-year deal from
the Yankees this winter. Earli-
er, the club re-signed free-
agent pitcher Dave Righetti to
a three-year agreement.

Ihree of four playoff teams
no stranger to Super Bowl

1
OCOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOCOCOOOOOO

By Dave Goldberg
AP Football Writer

On the surface, the NFL final
four doesn't look very strange —
three of the four teams left in the
Super Bowl Derby were there last
yean

But beneath that lie two tidbits
that show the effect of this sea-
son's 24-day strike and the effect
winning the Super Bowl has on
teams —— not only does no team
repeat as Super Bowl champion,
but no team that has won a Su-
per Bowl in the last four years has
even won a playoff game since.

That was accentuated this
weekend when San Francisco,
the 1984 champion, was upset
36-24 by Minnesota and Chica-
go, the 1985 winner, was beaten
by Washington 21-17 in its initial
playoff game for the second
straight year. 9 I

Consider this record:

The 1982 Super Bowl winner
were the Redskins.

It is the only team to make two
straight Super Bowl appearances
in the '80s — they lost to the
Raiders the next year in the Su-
per Bowl and made it tothe NFC

title game last year as a wildcard,

beating the Rams and Bears be-

 

fore losing to the Giants.

The Raiders won the Super
Bowl in 1983. The next year,
they lost to Seattle in the wildcard
game; then they lost their first
playoff game to the Patriots and
have failed to even make the
playoffs the past two seasons.

The 1984 champions, the
49ers, didn’t even_ score a touch-
down in their next two -playoff
games, losing both to the Giants,
17-3 and 49-3. Then came Satur-
day's upset by the Vikings,
eliminating for the first time in six
years, the NFC team that held the
home field advantage in the
playoffs. I

Then came the Bears, who lost
divisional playoff games to the
Redskins the past two years. And
the Giants, last year's champion,
didn't even make the playoffs this
yeah

The strike, meanwhile, adds
more perspective to the Redskins-
Vikings game.

Not only are the Vikings the
hot team, having routed the
Saints and 49ers, the teams with

‘ the best regular season record by

a combined score of 80-34, they

Washington with their regular

players — 10-4 to 9-4, the extra
game being the wild-card win
over New Orleans.

But the Redskins, who had one
of the best replacement teams,
were 3-0 during the strike to 0-3
for Minnesota, which had one of
the worst. So the Vikings had to
sneak into the playoffs with an
8-7 regular-season record and are
10-7 now, -while Washington
cruised to the NFC East title at
11-4 and is nows12-4 by virtue of
Sunday's 21-17 win in Chicago.

”We get to play at home, but
Minnesota's on a roll right now,"

said Gary Clark, Washington's

best receiver.

”And it doesn't seem to bother
them to play on the road.” .
, The oddsmakers recognize It.

They have installed Washing- ‘

ton as a favorite by only 31/2
points in the early line over the
so-called upstarts from Minneso-
ta. That spread is essentially the
odds the Redskins get for playing
on their home field. '

For playing with their real play-
ers, the Vikings have a 10-4
record to 9-4 for the Redskins —
the extra game being Minnesota's
wildcard win over New Orleans.
