VA, Hosptas Cry
For Trained Nurses  

Fifteen thousand more nurses are needed by Veterans Adminis-
tration hospitals to assure adequate nursing care.

According to lvliss Dorothy Wheeleiyone of 13 chief nurses of
veterans hospitals who attended a two weeks conference held last

 gummer by the university’s School of Nursing workshop. more than

50 per cent of the nurses at veteran's hospitals areieither veterans

of World VVar I or II.

Mi.ss Virginia Hellman, a vet-
the European theater
stressed the fact that good nurs-
ing in the V. A. hospitals is of pri-
mary importance.

“Nursing is nursing whether it
be a small child or a veteran. and
I don't like to think of veteran
nursing being any different from
other nursing.” Miss Hellman
said.

Leading the discussion ol
eran’s hospital problems,
Wheeler and Miss Hellman em-
phasized the’ importance of util-
ization of personnel: insurance of

Martin Opens

Revival of Pitt
Town Meeting

With the Dean of Men's approv-
al and increased student interest,
Pitt Town meeting is coming back
Oct. 15, at 2:30 p. m.

Last year’s discussions were
sponsored at an hour when most
students were at lunch. This year,
Jean Ditz and Bob Volkelsang, co-
chairmen, arranged for a town
crier, an outstanding speaker, and
a later meeting time. This pair
are assisted by Mary Batz, pub-
licity chairman of YWCA.

“Should America Play Power
Politics,” is the topic Dr. Albert
Martin, assistant professor of po-

litical science, will discuss at the
ﬁrst meeting in 1217 C1. Dr. Martin_

is an authority on world politics
and international relations of the
United states“

In an informal talk with Dean
Biddle, publicity chairman of the
YMCA, Lanny Govic, learned of
Biddle’s approval of plans to make
Pitt Town meeting a campus
force and a monthly event.

Extensive publicity is being cir-
culated; posters and information of
coming meetings will begiven to
students. The Pitt Town crier will
roam through the Tuck Shops, ﬁrst
ﬂoor halls, and other points around
the campus to call out his an-
nouncements.

Radical Drivel Plan Not Ready;
Commillee Hopes lo lry in Spring  

By Bill Catrow
Managing Editor

By the early months of 1948 a united Pitt. Chest. drive may I

be an accepted reality.

Although the annual Commun.it_v Chest drive will be con-
ducted this month as scheduled, Student congress is rushing
plans for the composite solicitation drive which, if accepted by
early spring, will bulk remaining campus appeal projects into
one general appeal for contributions to wo1"thwh.ile charities.

The scope of the plan and the
detail necessary before its adop-
tion by the University senate can
be reasonably assured account for
the necessary time lapse between
inception and the actual use of
the composite chest program ac-
cording to George Lynn, presi-
dent of Student congress and
chairman of the Pitt Chest drive
committee.

In the interim period the Com-
munity Chest drive will make its
annual campus appeal under the
direction of Congress appointees,
Pat Laikes and John l\/Ic‘<'inley.

Students Complain

Acting upon student dissatisfac-
tion with University.policy which
condoned a virtually incessant
solicitation for contributions to
many independent charities, Stu-
dent congress last spring resolved
that a plan be devised for one
large drive. Proceeds of the cam-
paign would be’ divided among
deserving agencies in proportion
to both need and student sympathy
with the agency’s activities.

-Although the 1946-47 Congress

urged the adoption of some united

that \Valt Armstead will serve as chairman of the dance, Jack

manager.

Armstead"s commiittee has made extensive preparations to
make this ﬁrst big dance of the season a social success.

The decorations for the dance, carrying out the harvest
motif, will be'announced next week iii the News.

A
charity solicitation,~lack of time

prevented submission of a deﬁnite
proposal during the spring se-
mester. I '

Acting upon the Congress reso-.
lution, Lynn and William Saal-,
bach, assistant to the Dean of Men,
contacted universities where sim-
ilar projects have proven applica-
ble and successful. A committee
consisting of Lynn, Abby Clark,
and Charles Davis, students, and
Mr. Saalbach and Mrs. Harriet
Kohberger, assistant to the Dean
of Women, representing adminis-
tration, has been appointed to
study the results of the survey
and devise a suitable plan for a
Pitt Chest drive.

Schools Contacted

Although enthusiastic reports
have been received from Yale uni-
versity, the University of Min-
nesota, and other schools, the plan
in use at the University of Wash-
ington seems the most feasible. A
detailed description of the ﬁrst
use of the Washington plan was
forwarded by the Campus Chest
committee of that university and_
its application to local campus
conditions is now being consid-
ered by the Pitt committee.

The committee’s prospectus,
either following the general de-
sign of the Washington plan or»
embracing a competely original
project, will be submitted to Stu-‘
dent Congress for approval.

If Congress accepts the com-
mittee recommendation, the pro-
posal will be forwarded to Chan-
cellor Rufus H. Fitzgerald at
whose disgression it may be
brought before the University sen-
ate for ﬁnalconﬁrmation. .

Lynn and his committee hope
to have the new plan before the
Senate by Christmas so that all
fund appeals, excepting the Com-
munity Chest drive, may be

I Fresh Yelp, Too

The first of this year saw a deﬁnite state-
ment concerning the use of the words “school
spirit.” We realized that, if such a nebulous
thing as “school spiri ” could be deﬁned, Pitt
wouldn’t have it. We decided to place the
Words on a “never” list.

, Last Friday, following an unimpressive pep-
rally, two freshmen women came into the ofﬁce

C ‘with. a list of signatures’ and" an editorial.

Tl:ey’re ideas were so set, that we thought,
amid a ﬂurry of “school spirit,” we would
print their words: ' I =. . X ‘

As freshmen at Pitt, we think the Pitt spirit
stinks. Anyon"e of our high schools could lick
you in -cheering and spirit——-maybe even in team
spirit. Of the ﬁfteen thousand that go to Pitt
not even two thousand canattend apep rally.

Thirteen thousand couldn’t have class the"

~ :1 student body, that wouldn’t support them?
After all, it’s the cheering that gives a worn
out player the get—up and go that’s needed
to win a game. -

I The pep rallys in a high school should and
_do serve to get the student body_ and team
united» to win. At Pitt everyone just sits
around. The only lively thing is the panther.

1At the Freshmen Women’_s'Assembly we
had made up our minds to just about die for
Pitt, if ‘we "had to—-—bu"t the Fresh women don’t
Want to die‘ alone'—or just with the team.

Sfasdium Comeback    

By Dick Kovar

Pitt saw a rebirth of the ‘good old days’,both on the ﬁeld and_
when 64,000 fans, minus their bearskin

in the stands Saturday,

coats, jammed into Oakland and overﬂowed the Stadium.

_ In addition to seeing Mil1igan’s men scratch, if not claw, the
Irish all afternoon, spectators watched a crack Pitt band, superior
even to the top-notch aggregation of the ’30s, ‘perform to a 160-step
tempo that sent band men scurrying like ants after each formation,

to reform magically" into perfect¢

letter patterns. '
Directed from all four sides of
the ﬁeld, the band’s pre-game and
halftime performances were .en-
joyed equally by those ‘on the 50
yard line andrthe fans who saw
the game framed by the go?)
posts. Directed from the sidelines
by Director Robert L. Arthur and
assistant Alfred C. Ackenheil, the

‘players about-faced several times
. during each number to give both

Pitt students and the Irish grout-
ers an earful of snappy tunes.
The game began for many as
early as 10:30 Saturday morning.
Oakland milkmen reported seeing
University students climbing the
Stadium hill when the sun was

‘giving only a faint hint pf the

blaze that scorched onlookers all
afternoon.

By 11:o30 the student section
nearest the 50-yard stripe was

.full, and 1 p. m: found students

already claiming aisle steps for
seats. When , the whistle blew,
mobs of seatless Pittites were
jammed in a stiﬂed mob at the
rear wall of the oval, and police
gave .up attempts to cleari the
aisles. .

Gin rummy whiled away the
pre-game hours for many, while
others indulged in extra-curricu-
lar spirits. One group. of freshman
women warmed up for an hour on
Pitt songs each with an open
Vade Mecum in her hand. It was
this same group who couldn’t
understand why no one else. sang
when the band played during the
game. '

“The boys in front of us had
no spirit at all, and the ones in
back were getting theirs from a

bottle. Why, even the Alma Ma-I

ter sounded weak,” wailed one.

I When the Panthers were push-
ing the Irish back toward their
own goal posts, the Pitt cheers
might even have been heard across"
the stadium, but for the most part
the cheerleaders seemed to be do-
ing some mute pantomime down‘
on the ﬁeld.

The stadium announcer, §how-
ever, seemed to know instinctive-
ly when the Pitt stands were go-
ing to cheer. He managed to an-
nounce that Joe Someone-or-other

was to meet his wife at Gate 3 just .

as each Pitt cheer rocked the Sta-
dium. ‘ 

The unseasonal heat hit every-
one, but no one so hard as the
Panther mascot. After a feeble try
at chinning on the goalposts, from
which he was retrieved by two
little men in white coats, the fur-
suited unfortunateyspent most of
the game trailing his tail and en-
gaging in non-strenuous pastimes,
like twirling a yo—yo or batting
at one of the swarm of pastic bal-
loons that ﬂoated over the ﬁeld.

When the ﬁnal whistle sound-
ed, only a handful of ”_Pitt sup-
porters had left, in spite of the
reversal in the play. Oakland was
still swarming with fans several
hours later, and the evening‘cro"wd
in downtown Pittsburgh showed
groups of cerebrees stil hitting the

joy-spots.

The general opinion of all seem-
ed to be that, “This is just the be-
ginning of another football era
like Suth‘erland’s day. We’ll be
back on top in a couple of years.”

Letters To

Dear Editor,’ .

In the issue of The Pitt News
dated Tuesday, Sept. 30, 1947,
there is an editorial entitled “Open
Up.” When this editorial was pub-
lished, the Treasurer’s Ofﬁce was
open from 8:30 a. m. to 5 p..m.
without any interruption between
12 noon and 1 p. In. for lunch.
The reason it was necessary to
close during the lunch hour is to
provide registration facilities
either at Syria Mosque or at other
points in the University such as
the Dental School, etc. Part of the
staff of this office is sent to these
out-of—the-oﬂice locations.

The Editor

Dear Editor:—

After having established an IN-
TERNATIONAL C O R RESPON-
DENCE BUREAU, I, on behalf of
members on mywaiting list, take
leave to apply to you. May I re-
quest you to put me, in touch
with readers of your paper inter-
ested in‘ friendly correspondence?

Having been secluded from "the
outside world these long years,

and yearning for a real democratic

enlightenment and a personal con-
tact from man to man across
boarders, my members wciuld only
too gladly welcome and answer
letters from abroad. Most of my

‘members (among them scientists,

students, experts, businessmen and
other well—educated ladies and
gentlemen, and also hobbyists".
housewives and even younguboys
and girls) have a. fairly good

' knowledge of English, but would

also be pleased to write in Ger-
man, if desired. (I am sure my
members will try and give their
pen-friends every satisfaction.
Individuals and groups of per-
sons may communicate with me
direct stating their particulars and
interests. All letters will be at-
tended to and all applications
linked up. If possible, two or three

‘ reply coupons should be inclosed

to cover expenses, and also, to
save time, an introductory letter
to future pen‘-friends’ over here
will be appreciated.

Pen-friends are a step towards
the creation of that international
friendship and goodwill that is to
essential to understanding and
peace, don’t you think so?

Yours. hopefully,

 Blue and Gold Gives Way

 .ToRegu|a’rion Olive Drab Uniform

The traditional blue and gold
ROTC uniforms will soon be a
thing of the past at the University.

Regulation olive drab army of-
ﬁcers uniforms will replace the
present outﬁts soon, according to
Colonel John I. Hincke, professor
of Military Science and Tactics.

The change from. blue to olive

‘drab will take place, for the ad-

vanced ROTC student, with few
exceptions’ this fall. '
Within one or two years, ac-

cording to C01. Hincke, the ele-

r,,,.«-—.-\.

H.

mentary course students will also

be issued 0. D.’s, thus making

the transition complete.

This will be the fourth major
change in uniform styles which
the ROTC has undertaken in its
28 years at Pitt.

The corps was established at the
University in September, 1919,
and the government-provided each
cadet with a World War I oﬁ‘icer-
type uniform.

When the Reserve Oﬁicers
Training Corps became better es-
tablished throughout the nation,
the War Department offered funds
to the various colleges to purchase
uniforms of any type they saw ﬁt.

‘Some institutions continued to
use the GI clothing but others,

’ including Pitt, established distinc-

tive cadet styles.

The first of these new uniforms
appeared in the early twenties.
It consisted of blue trousers with

, gold stripe and a high neck West

Point style coat. For dinner and
formal affairs there was a dress
uniform, white mess jacket,
gloves, stiff shirt, bow tie and blue
trousers.

High—c-ollared blue jackets were
replaced in the 30’s by the pres-
ent coats with lapel collars.

The blues presented a far snap-
pier appearance than the World
War I uniforms and were like the
styles at such purely military
schools as West Point, Virginia
Military Institute and Culver Mil-
itary Academy. _

The ﬁrst of the new O.D.’s were
issued last spring. In contrast to
the blue and gold outﬁts, with
which the student had to furnish
a white shirt and black tie at his
own expense, the new uniform
is complete and includes olive
drab trousers, shirt, overseas cap,
tie, woolen ﬁeld jacket, and of-
ﬁcers overcoat.

Except for detachable cadet in-

 signia, this is identical with the

New Officers
Help Piﬂ Vets
To Reorganize

New officers, and new, stronger
policies for 1947, marked the
opening meeting of Pitt's Veteran
Association. --

Al Cappozi, was elected to ﬁll
Charles Hutton’s office as vice
president, and the job correspond-
ing secretary went to Clark
Tomer. Edward Zadorozny suc-
ceeds August C. Hoffmeister who
vacated his board of directors
post to enroll at the University of
Charleston. James Wolfe, new
social chairman, is casting special
attention toward an improved
program for the coming months.

After a successful ﬁrst year on
campus, the ofﬁcial VA newspa-
per, Fire Power, is back with Pete
Massina holding the reins as edi-
tor. Other changes include the
appointment of Dave Raley who
will cover sports.

James W. Madden, president of
the organization, claims that “the
Pitt VA will strongly support bet-
ter and more housing for veterans,
and will also push the increased
subsistance bill upon which Con-
gress failed to act.”

A membership goal of 140-0 has
been set. The association hopes
to hit their stride, if renewals and
the drive are successful. Strong
participation in IM sports is a

turn of Dr. Asher Isaacs to the
board, relieving Mr. Robert Sulli-
van, whose appointment had been
temporary.

Nine students serve with the
faculty members on the Board,

  ides to Help Arthur
  DirectMarching Band

Pitt’s marching band boasts new assistant director and two stu-
dent leaders this year.

Associate Professor Alfred C. Ackenheil, William Lyon. and
Charles Leﬁler were recently appointed to assist Robert L. Arthur,
band director, at band performances on and off the football ﬁeld.

Ackenheil, from the department of civil engineering, is no new
hand in the music life of the University. As a student at Pitt, he
was‘ an active member of the
band, playing the c larinet.

He was graduated in 1938, and
later attended Harvard, where he
received a masters degree in civil
engineering. After joining the
University faculty in 1940, he
served as a naval ofﬁcer during
the war.

William Lyon, sophomore in the
college, is an accomplished mu-
sician who directed choir activi-
ties in the navy. His colleague,
Charles Leffler, sophomore in the
School of Engineering, plays the
oboe in the concert band.

knew he was about to be aﬁfather
and he was as composed as most

Then she hollered, and hollered

bass voice chiming in. And that’s
how Papa knew that James Paul
had joined the Longeran ranks.
When the nurse caming ﬂying
out into the reception room to
make the announcement, Papa sat
composed in a ‘chair, only to an-
swer, “Ah, I knew it all the time.”
Just a little bewildered, the

In spite of the lack of enthusi-
asm shown by the Pitt Player
toward the stars of “Unconquer-
ed,” C. B. DeMille and his busy
group put on quite a show Fri-
day afternoon.‘

The ga_thering, held on the
Forbes street side of the lawn,
opened with a short speech by
Harvey J. Pope, new director of
Pitt Players, who introduced De-
Mille. C.B., whose trousers were
slightly spotted with Pittsburgh
dust, made a short opening ad-
dress about his picture and em-
phasized that it actually was bas-
ed on history.

Stars of the picture were intro-
duced, including Howard De Syl-
va, Virginia Wells, and Billy De
Wolfe, who received an especially
warm welcome from the one hun-
dred students.

It was only then that the Pitt
Players were remembered. Lu-
cille Bodnar and Paul Rogal, who
have the leads in the Players’
“George Washington Slept Here,”
wandered through a portion of
the script of “Unconquered” un-
der the direction of DeMille.

After a "few fast photographs
and some clowning, the assem-

actress who recently appeared in
“Desert Fury.” Miss Scott, garbed
in a ﬂowing beige dress that al-
most swept the Cathedral lawn,‘
was a pleasant surprise to the
massed students.

The Longeran duet was amus-
ing hospital —oﬁ’icial,s, and Papa
stared wide-eyed at the marvel.
While peering through the glass at
the nursery, a nurse walked in
with another bundle of blue. Pitt’s
proud Papa smiled. He knew how
happy that little bundle was going
to make some other father.

The blue -bundle was placed
along side the Longeran duet, and
promptly began to ‘tune up with
them. He was in perfect pitch.
They made a perfect trio-—but no,
oh no, Papa thought, it can’t be!

“Another ﬁre-

I breathed. With
(this outburst,

pany.

It was just as
simple as that.
W h e n t h e

Papa Longeran, got up to his
knees, wiped the cold sweat from
his brow, and limply uttered,
“Europe was never like this.”

Business Level

Business in the Pittsburgh dis-
trict last week rose to the best
level since early August, accord-
ing to the Bureau of Business Re-
search of the University. Gains
were particularly shown in steel
mill operations, blast furnace ac-
tivity, and department store
sales.

Steel mills at that time operat-
ed at 98.5 per cent of practical
capacity, bituminous coal produc-
tion was up, and electric power
output was the highest. in recent
months.

Gross sales of 11 department
stores were one-third greater in
the four weeks ending Sept. 27
than in the same four weeks last
year. September 1946 sales, how-
ever, were greatly reduced by
power strike.

New Fashions

Tonight is the night when the
YWCA expects to do its bit con-
cerning the raging discussion on

skirts—short versus long.

The forum on the new lashions
is part of a style-conscious even-
ing, in which the Y plans to pre-
sent “Passing Through the Years”,
a parade of modes from Civil War

. days to the present.

  

Pitt coeds will model fashions
from the various years, and Esther
Dalton will act as narrator for
the pageant. During the forum,
Mary Lou Guidish and Pat Cun-
ningham plan to speak for the new
long skirts, while ‘Joan Cronis
and Peggy Dailey counter with
their arguments against them.
Elaine Saupp, president of Wom-
en’s Speech association, will keep
them apart in her role of mod-
erator.

The program is slated for the
Metropolitan Y on Dithridge
street,ifrom 6 to 8 p. m. Mrs. Ed-
na T. Batz, director of the YW,
has invited every woman student

-’to_ come- and join in the argu-

ment.

Math Class Makes

 

Fun With Figures

If this and that and such, plus half of this and that, is twice
as such, plus ten less one; while this is that and half of this; and
that issuch less twice of that; then just how much is this and

that and such?

Interested‘? Then rush right up to the math department and
sign up for Math "123, euphemistically known as Recreational Mathe-

matics. 9

The only prerequisite for this
two-credit course is the ability to
think. Although primarily intend-
ed for teachers, i.t is opened to any
brain desiring to enter.

It enables the fortunate few to
assemble a collection of puzzle
problems, paradoxes, and math-
ematical gains under such head-
ings as arithmatic, algebra, geom-
etry and miscellaneous.

Imagine the enjoyment of arith-
metical or geometrical recrea-
tion, the delight of resolving magic
squares, and the satisfaction of
solving map coloring problems.
Or, if fancy so dictates, contem-
plate the beauties of a unicursal
problem: the theory of mazes and
geometrical trees.

Waiting for your solution are
the three "classical problems of
geometry; the duplication of a
cube; the trisection of an angle;

and the quadrature of agcircle. If
you unravel these intricacies, or
tire in the attempt, cryptography

and diaphantine analyses prom- .

ise an amusing past time to while
away the hours.

To tide you over until you can
sign up for the course, here is a
problem in diophantine anlyses. A
man cashed a check and by mis-
take, received in dollars what he
should have received in cents, and
in cents, what he should have re-
ceived in dollars. He pocketed the
money without counting it. After
spending 65 cents of the proceeds,
he discovered that he had twice as
much left as the check called for.
For what amount was the check
drawn?

Remember, the solution must be
in whole numbers.

Unnoticecl Managers

lPlay Vital Grid Role

By Myron Kopelman

All the orchids are thrown at the grid mentors and play-
ers, but usually standing by unnoticed is the manager, an in-
dispensable cog in the football machine. In Pitt’s case, it is
Velton (Val) Castrodale,'1947 head manager.

Val, who has been on the Pitt scene for three years, is a
modest young man who gives the impression of knowing con-
sideraly more than he is willing to say.

Hailingpfrom Cecil, Pennsylvania, he terms his town “the
garden spot of America.” But he humbly denies that he is one

of its brightest sﬂowers.

ager for two years prior to his
appointment as head man, Castro-
dale well knows the importance of
capable assistants.

good assistants working under you.
I’ve got a swell gang, They’re not
afraid to give up their time, no
matter how much, in order to get
the work done and keep things

“And there’s lots to be _ done,

The Maize and Blue are a ‘well balanced juggernaut who can

Then too, they are three‘ deep in every spot. Crisler himself has
pointed. out that he does not see any difference between his ﬁrst_

To Shake Woe

The Pitt-Notre Dame
plunged Frank Leahy, Irish men-
tor, deeper into the well of pes-
simism, but this time he had a
perfect right to be there.

For two full quarters an under-
dog Pitt team had told the South
Benders that they had better hurry

it they expect to catch up with '

their press clippings.
After the game, Leahy met the
same press that had accused him

ofowning algloomy temperament, —

with .a cordial, smile and an I-
told-you—so spread across his face

“Our guys were out there just
prancing around, expecting every-

body to fall ‘over just because
Dame _

they’re_ wearing Notre
shirts,” said Leahy.
I Forward Wall Worst
f‘So many people,” he went op,
“have said that our line ‘is the

best in Notre Dame history that I

the players began "to believe it
themselves. To me, they looked
like the‘ worst.

“_The right side of our l_ine was
especially weak. Pitt was running

in and out of Martin‘ (end Jim a
Martin) and right over Urban‘

(tackle Gasper Urban).”

Leahy was evidently quite sur-
prised by Pitt’s, showing. “This
fellow Milligan did an outstanding
job,” he exclaimed. “His boysiwere
alert, spirited, and well—poised.”

Sometimes it is considered a
subtle act of bragging when a
victorious coach compliments the
losing coach. But Leahy emphat-
ically made it known that he was

_ not “being braggadocian.”

“My hat is off to that man,” he

declared.

JENKINS ARCADE

The play came late in the second period.

‘Chiselers, Incorporated’ Clip

Irish Grid

By Donald Griffin

Every year about this time, the]

birds head South, and wild life,
in general, begins to burrow un-

derground. Strangely enough, on
their way down the small insects
andanimals of the forest meet a
specie of human insect on its way
up.

This human insect is common-
ly called a=scalper. He moved up
to Desota Street last Saturday
where he and his fellow parasites
found the situation perfect for
their tactics. .
k The game had been a sell-ou
for weeks before. Thousands of
the Notre Dame faithful had de-
layed too long in ordering ducats.
Many .were on the lookout for
scalpers’ bargains.

Buyers Stream Up Hill

The scalpers gave no bargains.
Theirs is a true money-making
business. Headquarters for “Chis-
lers, Inc.” was the hillside op-
posite Gate one. There, a'thin-f'ac-
ed man, with sharp eyes, com-
manded his squad of smooth-
working salesmen.

No sooner would one of his co-
horts bring him a few recently
acquired tickets than he would
hand them off to another hireling
who rushed away to search for
prospective buyers. And there

faithful at Stadium

were plenty of buyers in the mas-
sive mob which streamed up the
hill.

Although the human vampires
were unnoticed by the police
thereabouts, anyone seeking an
inﬂation-struck ticket could pick
them out unerringly. Either they
park solitarily in the middle of
the street or huddle in a small
group on the sidewalk.

Use ‘Buddy, Buddy’ Stuff

Oneindividual, whose face ap-
peared boneless and whose clothes
had that slept-in look, boasted of
having peddled two 40-yard paste-
boards for 20 dollars each. He
claimed that he disposed of them
in three minutes.

A well—dressed gentleman, slow-
ly climbing the Desota heights,
whipped 15 dollars from his wal-
let—apparently in anticipation of
a purchase. Notre Dame pennants
weren’t that expensive.

The scalpers’ spiel runs like this:
“Hey, Bud! I’m just the man
you’re looking for.” These shady
characters can pick a ticket seek-
er just as easily as they them-
selves can be‘ located. Occasion-
ally, they miss their guess and get
an answer like, “Well, .I’m not
looking for you.”

Prices Drop at Game Time

Many of the scalpers unloaded
their mittful of tickets before

o’clock drew near, the price went
down. The lowest quotation for
decent seats dropped to a proﬁt-
making “bottom” of eight dollars
for singles an-l- ten dollars for
pairs.

The scavengers shrewdly refus-
ed to have any truck with the few
Student Activity cards offered
them. After all, they could get in-
to trouble with them. With the
regular tickets, everything is safe.

By game time, the hawk—eyed
sharpies had folded their folding
money and not so silently stole
away.

Iﬁsh Beat
Pitt, 40-6

An offensive-minded Pitt elev-
en put up a thrilling battle for 30
minutes Saturday before the su-
perior reserves and guiding-gen-
ius of Quarterback Johnny Lujack
combined to give Notre Dame a
convincing 40-6 triumph.

With power to burn and Con-

nellsville Johnny tending‘ the in-
cinerator, the Irish blasted out 27
points in the second half as a
down payment on their claim to
the mythical national champion-
ship.
‘Their method was an old and
time—tested one —- never let your‘
opponents have-the ball until you
score and make certain you score
ﬁrst. In the process, the green-
shirted South Benders used the
airlanes extensively to compile
their huge margin.

Irish Score First

The Irish went 57 yards in six
plays for their initial six pointer.
Lujack’s 45-yard pass to End Jim
Martin set the stage for Brennan’s
subsequent smash off right tackle.
The score came with only six
minutes gone on the scoreboard.

The most_ exciting play, how-
ever, followed the opening Notre
Dame TD when Tony DiMatteo
took Oracko’s kickoff on the Pitt
16 and zoomed down to the Irish
30 where a missed block prevent-
ed his going all the way.

Miss TD on Fumble

Pitt missed the touchdown be-
cause of a fumble on the Notre
Dame six—inch line. But later, in
the second period, they rammed
over a score which _more than
made up for the delinquency.

It was fourth and three on the
Irish seven. Two passes had fall-
en incomplete. The determined
Panthers opened an immense hole
in the left side of the Irish line
and Carl DePasqua bulled over
for the lone Pitt tally. '

“George Washington,” slated too
sleep here Nov. 6, 7 and 8, has a
cast.

The Pitt Players’ opening show,
“George Washington Slept Here,”

is now under production after ﬁnal ’

try-outs last Thursday night. Se- ' A

lected for featured roles are Bill -
Lucille

Claypole, John Ingrim,
Bodnar, Jackie l\/IcKim, and John

Forest. Heading a supporting cast ‘ j
of twelve are Nancy Mechling, Jo 
Basco, and Tom Ryan. ’
The play follows the attempts — V

of Newton and Annabelle Fuller
(Ingrim and Bodnar) to repair the
ramshackle Pennsylvania farm-
house which they bought because
“George Washington slept in it.”
After spending all their time and
money on the house, they are sud-
denly threatened by its loss. A
secondary plot involves the ro-
mantic interests of Steve Eldridge
(Forest) and the Fullers‘ vivacious
but sensible daughter, Madge
.(lVIcKim).

In spite of the apparently tragic
plot, the play is one of the fun-
nier light comedies that succeeded
from a Broadway show to a Hol-
lywood movie. Jack Benny, radio
comedian, made “GWSH” famous
on the screen and radio as well.

Under the direction of Harvey
Pope, Players’ permanent faculty
director, “George” rehearsals are
scheduled to begin soon. Technical
staffs have not as yet been an-
nounced.
