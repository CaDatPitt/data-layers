In New York, both 1l0—story Trade Center towers col-
lapsed after” being struck Police and other rescue person-
nel. were trying to evacuate some 50,000 people who
worked there, but many were apparently trapped when the
South Tower slumped to the ground at 10:07 am and the
area was cloaked in dust and rife with panic and confusion
when the North Tower fell at 10:29 am.

In an instant, the Trade Center was a pile of crumpled
metal. Fragments of buildings and pieces of wall lay
everywhere. Fires burned in piles of trash and debris.
Automobile gas tanks exploded every few minutes. The
area was plunged into _complete darkness, a soot—b1ack-
erred, desolate horror where almost nothing moved_Up to
two inches of ash covered the streets of downtown
Manhattan. _

There was no immediate estimate of casualties, but
eyewitnesses reported several people falling to their deaths
from the stricken buildings.

New York Mayor Rudolph  said, ‘,‘I have a

sense it’s_ a horrendous number of lives lost.” .

American Airlines and United Airlines said there was
a total of 266 people on four of their lost ﬂights.

In Washington, similar Pandemonium reigned. The

White House, the Supreme Court, the U.S. Capitol, and -

other federal buildings were evacuated before A noon

Students watch as national tragedy unfolds

CHARLOTTE TUCKER
Assistant News Editor

Over and over again the reaction was
the same.

Disbelief mingled with horror and
occasionally tears on the faces of those who
gathered on the main ﬂoor of the William
Pitt Union to watch coverage of the attacks
on New York City, Washington, D. C., and
of a related crash in Somerset, Pa.

It seemed, at times, like some students
were having a difﬁcult time grasping every-
thing that had happened

“I mean, the World Trade Center —
that’s New York City right there,” said sen-
ior Marina Augoustidis about the total
destruction of the famous landmark. ,

Eric Lanni, a junior, speculated about
what steps the United States would take
next

“I just wonder if [the United States] has
the capacity to investigatethis attac ” he
said

Chancellor Mark Nordenberg’s ofﬁce
decided to close the University and cancel
classes. In part, their statement read, “Given
the tragic and troubling events of this mom-
ing, the University of Pittsburgh is suspend-
ing normal operations for the rest of today.”

The order canceled classes and
required students to leave the Cathedral of
Learning. All campus cafeterias remained
open, except for the Cathedral Cafe.

According to Pitt spokesman Robert
Hill, there were no threats against the
University or the Cathedral, but the decision
was made “in response to events of the
day.”

In a statement released late yesterday
afternoon, Hill said, “Having carefully fol-
lowed the events of the day and in the
absence of any change in circumstances this
evening, the University of Pittsburgh
expects to resume normal operations tomor-
row. All ofﬁces will reopen and all classes
will meet at their scheduled times.”

Nordenberg left his ofﬁce in the
Cathedral to take a walking tour of campus.
He stood at the back of a group of students
gathered around a television monitor in the
Union. I

N ordenberg said he had heard the news
early in the morning and that he had decid-
edto walk around campus, “to seehowpeo-
ple are doing.”

He stressed that while he didn’t want to
let the attacks paralyze the University, “we
do need to be prudent.”

Nordenberg also said that he and his

staff were in the process of putting together
a plan that will meet the needs of students.

One facet of that plan is to make the
Counseling Center available for students
who want to talk about the attacks.

Dr. Penny Crary, the director of the
Counseling Center, said that her olﬁce sent
counselors to the residence halls. She and
other counselors were planning group ses-
sions for people who need to talk

Crary said that even students who were
not directly affected might feel unexpected
emotions in the wake of the attack She said
that many would likely feel shock that such
a thing could happen, and some might even
feel personal vulnerability. ,

“Something like this creates anxiety
about the unpredictability of life,” Crary
said “It’s just a reminder of how many
things are out of our control.”

Crary recommended that students talk
with each other about their fears and anxi-
eties. '

She said that two counseling groups‘
would meet Wednesday, one in the morning
and one in the afternoon. For more infor-
mation call (412) 648-7930.

Across campus, little seemed amiss.
Vendors sold posters on the Towers’ patio

‘ and only a few small signs posted in Towers

lobby and inthe Union gave hints that today
was not an ordinary day.

The signs implored students to donate
blood at Central Blood Bank _on Fifth
Avenue toward Downtown.

Deborah Ervine, a spokeswoman for
the blood bank, said that while she didn’t
have a timetable for transporting blood to
Washington and New York, she encouraged
anyone who could to donate.

planned and executed terrorist conspiracy, with —

At a news conference just after 1 p.m EDT,
President Bush said that he believed it was a coordi-
nated series ofattacks, and saidhehadputthe mili-

down and punish those responsible for these coward-

Intelligence sources briefed members of
Congress Within hours of the ﬁrst attack on the World
Trade Center’s southern tower and conﬁrmed that the
U.S. government considers the terrorist attacks as
coordinated and the work of some organized group.

Sen. Onin G. Hatch, R-Utah, said that during the
brieﬁng, intelligence officials said the attacks bear the
“signature” of bin Laden, who oversees a vast net-
work of Islamic extremists throughout the world

“Who else would have the capability to coordi-
nate the simultaneous hijacking of several aircraft?”
said one FBI oﬂicial who asked that his name not be

because they “were extremely well—organized and
extremely secret.” -

Authorities believe that the tenorists had help
from airport ground crews, that they chose cross-

. country ﬂights because the planes would be heavily
loaded with fuel and that their handlers are probably ~

amazed that their plans so easily slipped past the U.S.
intelligence apparatus.

“We’re just amazed at the level of coordination

“It’s so unusual that a pilot would bank and

itated? And if they were, then the hijackers had to
have somebody about to ﬂy the planes themselves.

their own lives, to save people on the groun ” the
investigator said ’

“It is premature to level allegationsagairrst a per-

said the Taliban’s ambassador to neighboring
Pakistan, Mullah Abdul Salam Zaeef. “It was a well-

Yoram Schweitzer, an Israeli countertenorism
expert who specializes in Osarrra bin Laden, noted
that bin Laden has a wide network of organizations,

“He is a very cautious planner and it takes him a

within 10 minutes of each other, as well as the bomb-

We condemn this.”

The State Department told ambassadors

around the world that they could close their ~

embassy buildings if they thought that was
appropriate. There was no immediate word
on how many embassies had done that.

In Lima, Peru, Secretary of State Colin

ing thatthe attacks “will not affect the nature

them to justice.” »

Although it was impossible to get an
acctnate accounting of casualties ﬁonr the
attacks, American and United conﬁnned they
each had two missing ﬂights. American
Flight 11, and Flight 77, leaving from Dulles

Airport to Los Angeles, had a total of 156

people aboard United Flight 93, which

crashed in Somerset County, .Pa., and Flight
175, ﬁom Boston to Los Angeles, had 110
people aboard .

The ﬁrst crash at the Trade Center
occurred shortly before 9 am. Tuesday when
a plane plowed into the upper ﬂoors of the

. North Tower, sending a plume of smoke and

ﬂames shooting into the sky above gaping
holes and exploding windows.

Minutes later, with television cameras
already trained on me burning building, a sec-
ond airplane, appearing almost ﬂy-sized
against the morning sky, came into viewers’
screens and smashed into the South Tower,
exploding in a ﬁreball

JohnAxisa, who was getting off a PATH
train to the World Trade Center, told the
Associated Press he watched “bodies falling
out” of the ﬁrst building, then felt the heat of
the second explosion as he came out on the
street

Debris rained down on the commuter
trafﬁc packing the crowded downtown
streets. People struggled to get out of the

damaged buildings and ran in panic up the
city streets. Thousands of pieces of what

appeared to be ofﬁce paper ‘came driﬂing

over Brooklyn, about three miles away.

“We heard a large boom and then we
Saw all this debris just falling,” said Haniet
Grimm, who was inside a bookstore on the

World Trade Center’s ﬁrst ﬂoor when the ﬁrst p

explosion rocked the building.
“I was in the World Financial Center

_ looking out the window,” one woman told

the Associated Press. “I saw the ﬁrst plane
and then 15 minutes later saw the other plane
just slam into the World Trade Center.”

Another eyewitness, AP newsman
Drmstan Prial, described a strange sucking
sound ﬁom the Trade Center buildings after
the ﬁrst building collapsed: “W1ndows shat-
tered People were screaming and diving for
cover. People walked around like ghosts,
covered in dirt, weeping and wandering
dazed”

“After the ﬁrst plane came in, they start-
ed evacuating everybody, then the building

fell, hinting people, crushing people,” said‘

Doug Hasarr, 32, otﬁce manager of a down-
town company called artnetcom. “People
ﬂocked out of the subway. Cars were explod-
ing. I was running over to help people. I saw
probably 50 to 70 people dead  severed

There were no immediate estimates of
casualties, but at St. Vmcent’s Hospital in
Greenwich Village, uptown from the Trade
Center, a doctor, Steven Stern, said “hun-
dreds of people are burned ﬁom head to toe.”
_ Within an hour of the Trade Center
crashes, another plane smashed into the
Pentagon, on the Army side of the building.
Erin Kern, 25, a civilian budget analyst
for the Navy, said she was in her oﬁice on the
building’s fourth ﬂoor when she felt and
heard an enonnous blast
“I saw right across from me and above
me debris ﬂying towards our windows,”
Kern said, her voice still quivering nearly 90
minutes after the attack.
“It looked to me like part of the building
had blown up and debris ﬁom that blast was
‘ﬂying outward” she said

Kern said military ofﬁcers took charge
and ordered people to walk, not run, to exit
the building. Kern’s group headed for the
courtyard in the center of the Pentagon,

_ regrouped,_ and walked out to the north park- ’

ing area. ‘ ' _

“Izheard a lot of crying,” she said “I
think it was just people aﬁai ”

Shortlyafter the Pentagon crash, the fed-
eral govemment began shutting down cabi-
net ofﬁces and tightening security. At 9:45

I Tuesday morning, Capitol Hill was in a state

of confusion as police evacuated the main
Capitol builfing and adjacent oﬂice build-
ings.
