The Paul Hackett era is

In a prepared statement
that lasted 97 seconds,

Jaynes said that the deci-

over the past three years.

He denied allegations that

The Collegiate YMCA has
solved some of the prob-
lems of Christmas shopping
for students at Pitt and
Carlow with its Shopping
Spree Run.

The YMCA has been pro-
viding dorm-to-dorm trans-
portation to the malls each
weekend and will continue
to provide it until Dec. 19.

“Some students live out
of town and aren’t familiar
with the malls, or don’t have
a car. And who wants to go
on a bus. with a bunch of
packages?” said Gloria

Townsend, Collegiate YMCA
advisor.

Lucinda Henriksen, YMCA
student president, said this
program is not only a ser-
vice to students without
cars, but it is also a fundrais-
er for other student volun-
teer programs.

“It’s a good break before
finals for’ people to spend
the day shopping instead of
studying,” Henriksen said.

Students can call the
Collegiate YMCA at 648-

a place on one of the vans.
The YMCA will be going to

Riclesharing oﬂers help for commiiters

By Alex Cone
For The Pitt News

It is 5 a.m., and Heather Day's
journey is just beginning. Her
alarm goes off, and she hustles to
feed and walk her six Great
Danes. Then she gets herself
ready for classes at Pitt.

But Heather Day, like so many
other commuters, cannot walk
outside her door and down the
street to her class. She must bat-

tle rush hour, find a parking
space and get to classes on time.

"I drive like a maniac,” she
said.

Commuters like Day often find
themselves unable to engage in
many social activities on campus.

“I sometimes feel out of it,”
first-year student Aaron Vanek
said. “I don’t have enough time
to go to football games or join
campus groups. I live in Irwin. It
takes me over an hour to get

here every day."

Students that commute often
have jobs to pay for the cars that
they drive to Oakland every day.

“I used to go to school from
nine to five and Work from six to
midnight,” Day said. “I had to
quit working nights and get a
day job down here because I
dropped off the dean’s list. I
bought a car when I graduated
from high school, and I need my

NEW COURSES FOR SPRING TERM

Religious Studies 0435:
Religious Themes in American Literature
Professor Paula M. Kane
Tuesday and Thursday, 2:30 - 3:45

This course will study approximately seven films and
related novels/texts which address religious themes and
It will evaluate how film and fiction have
represented questions about morality, punishment, guilt, the
supernatural,‘ the sacred and demonic, death, the afterlife,
established religion, and so forth. We shall also evaluate
how film generated a new visual language to explore
religious feeling. Thus, we will focus our attention on
techniques of reading films and fiction, as well as on the
human experience of religion.

Spanish Culture From Dictatorship to Democracy
Professor Pamela Bacarisse  
Monday, Wednesday and Friday, 12:00 - 12:50 »

This course will deal with Spanish culture since the so-
called destape (”taking the lid off”) and the subsequent
movida (new wave in the arts) which began with the death
of Franco in 1975, and in particular with the effect of the
abolition of government censorship of the arts. There will
be seminars and discussions of texts and films from before

Continued from page I
timetable has been set and
that “we will be thorough
and complete in the
search.”

Jaynes said that it is
important to find the right
person for the job and that
Pitt is looking for someone
with successful experience

.as a head coach.

“That is certainly not a
requirement,” Jaynes said.
“But [we are looking for]
someone who has had suc-
cess — someone who has

g sound, solid principles’?

0 O 0

One of the candidates
rumored to succeed
Hackett is former Pitt
Coach Jackie Sherrill, cur-
rently the head coach of
Mississippi, State. Sherrill
resigned as head coach of
Texas A&M in 1988 just
prior to an NCAA investiga-
tion of his football pro-
gram. Jaynes did not deny

that Sherrill is a candidate
but insisted that Pitt will
not tolerate any impropri-
eties in its football pro-
gram.

Pitt is already awaiting
possible sanctions from the
NCAA pending review of
an in-house investigation
submitted in May that
admitted to several recruit-
ing violations by the foot-
ball program under
Gottfried.

Jaynes praised Hackett’s
dedication to high academ-

ic standards but stressed_

the importance of fielding
a winning football program
as well. ’

“I think it is important
that you have a balance,
and certainly academics is
very, very important, but at
the same time you’ve got
to be competitive so that
your fans and alumni can
support your program,”
Jaynes said.

“Pitt has had a proud tra-
dition. There is a very
strong commitment from
our administration that we
want to compete at the
highest level and compete
successfully,” he said.

“We also want to run a
program that our students,
alumni, faculty and fans
can take great pride in. We
want to win. That doesn’t
mean we can win every
game, but we ought to be
in the ones we ought to be
in,” Jaynes said. “We have
some tough days ahead,
but anything can be
accomplished. Certainly
there is nothing wrong
with wanting to win.”

- O C O

In his three seasons as
Pitt’s football coach,
Hackett compiled an over-
all record of 13-20-1
including a victory in his
inaugural game, the John
Hancock Bowl in 1989.

Hackett initially joined
Pitt’s staff on March 14,
1989, as offensive coordi-
nator and .quarterbacks
coach. Prior to coming to
Pitt, Hackett served as
quarterbacks coach for the
Cleveland Browns (1981-
’82), quarterbacks and
receivers coach for the San
Francisco 49ers (1983-’85)
and the passing offensive
coordinator with the Dallas
Cowboys (1986-’88).

Hackett’s college coach-
ing experience included
four years as the quarter-
backs coach at University
of California at Berkeley
(1972375) and five years as
quarterbacks and receivers
coach at Southern Cal.

A graduate of the
University of California at
Davis, Hackett starred as a
quarterback from 1966-’68,
leading the Far
Conference in passing as a
senior.

Commuters who do not have
cars or do not want to pay for
parking ride the bus into
Oakland. Those like senior
Rachel Ryersbach may spend up
to three hours every day riding
the bus. “I don’t have much time

to do things on campus,” she
said. “I spend almost 90 minutes
in rush hour every morning and
afternoon.”

Many problems such as help-
ing commuters find alternate
ways into Oakland and directing
students to parking lots may
often times be solved by the Pitt
Ridesharing Program.

Program Manager Kathleen
Miller said that Ridesharing is
open to all commuters. “We set
people up in carpools, vanpools
and also direct them to possible
PAT routes that they could use,”
Miller said. “Students think that a
parking permit is included in
their tuition. They show up and
have no place to park their car.

O C
Hohday W1SheS

Having just stuffed ourselves during the Thanksgiving
holiday, the thought of more food is repulsive to most
_of us. Turkey, stuffing and cranberries were just a few
of the things that graced most of the tables in America.

This Thanksgiving was something to be particularly
thankful for: the economy made an upturn last quarter
and the shops on Black Friday were
mobbed with people who actually were buying. As we
leave the holiday where we are thankful for all we have
received, our minds turn to the holiday where we are
supposed to be thankful to give.

The economic upturn couldn’t have come at a more
appropriate moment. At a time when the recession
c-aused “politicians to focus on “America first” the
thought of foreign aide was about as appetizing as a
fifth serving of turkey. As Christmas approaches and the
economy rebounds, the United States can look to help
Somalia in this season of giving.

While we must continue to be weary of our own
problems, it is difficult to rationalize the continued blind
eye with which the world has viewed Somalia. In the
last two years 300,000 Somalis have died from either
starvation or the fighting which has destroyed their

_ country. _ .
 0, .-- Moreover, another two million are in danger of starva-
tion, as relief efforts continue to prove inefficient and
*  unworkable. Civil war, the type which has led to a dif-
7' ‘fusion of power among several competing groups, has
I  led to the total breakdown of law and ‘civility.

‘The United Nations, the Red Cross, the European

5 Community and the United States have supplied“ relief .

convoys withfood and medical supplies for some time

_ now. Unfortunately though, most of these relief supplies

never reach the people because they are swallowed up
by warlords who turn and sell them on the black mar-
ket. With a UN peacekeeping force of only 500 — most-
ly Pakistanis — things will get much worse before they
get better. ’

' The only thing that will lead to drastic improvements
"in Somalia is not the continued “watch and wait” atti-
tude being practiced, but a bigger UN force led by the
best equipped United States personnel. We are hardly
calling for an all-out war effort. The mere presence of
more UN troops would be enough to restore order in

0 the torn region.

Those who oppose risking American lives in a strug-
gle in which the United States has no strategic risk are
somewhat justified. But the fact is that the United ‘States,

along with the rest of the world, has a particularly.

humanitarian interest here. Furthermore, opposition to
peacekeeping forces on grounds on invading national
sovereignty are unsubstantiated, for there is no govern-
ment in Somalia. The benefits of this should not be

- underestimated.

Middle East peace talks need help

Here’ it is again — another
cycle of the Middle East
Peace Talks, now in its sev-
enth round. And for the first
time cynicism about the tur-
bulent past of the Arab-
Israeli relations is overshad-
owed by a_ sudden burst of
optimism.

Seeing these bitter enemies
smiling at each other across
the negotiation table is per-
haps the first hope in recent
history that Arabs and
Israelis may do the same
across their sacred biblical
borders.

The agenda for the talks is
still the same kaleidoscope
of problems that have dead-
locked the previous rounds
— Syria demanding Israel to
return the Golan Heights and
the Palestinian Arabs press-

ing for independence from

Israel in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip.

Both Arab parties stem
their claim for the land from
the 1967 Six Day War when
Israel responded to the
heavy military buildup along
the Arab borders by sweep-
ing through these territories
and securing
since.

But for the Arabs, the 1967
war never ceased. "Over the
last three decades, the frus—‘
trated Arabs unfurled this
gruesome battle to every por-
tion of the world} Masked
Palestinian Liberation Org-
anization (PLO) terrorists, in
an effort to gain international
recognition to their opp-
ressed lives in Israeli refugee
camps, strategically butch-
ered innocent Jewish victims
in places like the 1972
Olympic games and interna-
tional airports.

Now Israel aspires to end
this war by offering its Arab
adversaries some concessions
in an almost goodwill effort
to make peace. The Yitzhak
Rabin government for the
first time used the word
“withdrawal” in the Golan

them ever‘

Heights “dispute, signaling
that Israel might accept a
demilitarized zone on the
strategic zone. In the past,
only Syriahas discussed an
Israeli evacuation.

Syria’s tentative acceptance
to capitalize on Israel’s
demand for a treaty marking
the beginning of normal rela-
tions and reconciliation is an

limpudent attempt to initiate

Leon  
Fuksman

the land—for—peace proposal.

To the Palestinians, Israel
offered a timetable leading to
elections of an autonomous
Palestinian authority in the
occupied territories in April
or May 1993. But the Pal-
estinians ‘indefinitely re-
nounced the offer in hope of
their ultimate objective — an
independent Palestinian
state.

Neglecting to accept
Israel’s proposal could be the
Palestinians last chance to
attain any form of autonomy.
The recent increase of terror-
ism against Israel by radical
Palestinians and Syrian-

’ backed Islamic fundamental-

ist groups may lead to Israel
walking out on the peace
talks. Such a move could
hinder any further negotia-
tions.

The Palestinian negotiators
stem most of this hesitation
from their consultant Yasir
Arafat, chairman of the noto-
rious PLO, who claims
responsibility for confronting
Israel and making all the
political decisions.

The Palestinian dream for a
homeland has existed since
the 1948 establishment'of
Israel when Jews from
around the world began
flocking back to their ancient
biblical homeland. Most of
these early Zionists either
ignored the Arabs already

living in Palestine or
assumed they could be
bought off or eventually fall
to Jewish domination.

If the Palestinians ever

I want to secure an oppres-

sion-free. life, they need to
get rid of the PLOldominance
and craft a strategy directly
with the Israeli regime.

Five years ago, Arafat
pressed for a Palestinian

’ nation by launchihg lthe

bloody intifada -— an upris-
ing against the Israeli leader-
ship that set rock-‘throwing
Palestinian adolescents
against young Israeli soldiers
who anxiously gripped the
triggers of their machine
guns. it

Today, the violence has
claimed hundreds of lives on
both sides. And Arafat’s

dream for statehood has crip— A

pled Palestinian economy
and riven the people into
ethnical and regional divi-
sion.

Earlier this year, I spent a I

semester studying abroad at
Tel Aviv University in Israel.
One weekend I travelled
extensively throughout the
West Bank. The sights of the
intifada were really disturb-
ing.

Almost everywhere I went
the streets and windy alleys
were empty. Tourist were
nearly as obsolete as the
locals. '

In Bethlehem, the display
windows of the once lucra-
tive shops were covered with
nationalistic graffiti from rival
uprising groups instead of
showcases of baby Jesus.

The Palestinian merchants
will never again hear the
chatter of tourists unless they
cut the strings of their pup-
peteer — Arafat.

This is the only way Israel
will accept the biblical idea
of “beating their swords into
plowshares.”

Active foreign
policy needed

I read with interest Michael Brittingham’s
litany of uncertainties regarding Bill Clinton’s
foreign policy objectives (Nov. 17), and I

believe Mr. Brittingham makes some glaring _

miscalculations in his column.

For example, Mr. Brittingham talks about
China’s cooperation with international efforts,
citing its UN approval for military force against
Iraq. Is that the best example Mr. Brittingham
could l'lI'lCl? As if the Chinese really played a role
in the Gulf War. If there is a reason to isolate
the Chinese, we need look no further than the
Tianemen Square tragedy. Instead of publicly
scolding the Chinese, we grant them most
favored nation trading status. As if this courtesy
will motivate the govemment of Deng Xiaoping
to change its human rights policies.

Using Mr. Brittingham’s logic, we should
smile at the Bosnians, complimenting them for
dealing forcefully with domestic affairs. And if
Mr. Brittingham believes the Chinese act with
anything more than economic motives in mind,
then he just doesn’t understand foreign policy.

If Mr. Brittingham believes the U.S. should
merely stay at home, while Muslims, Serbs and
Croats slaughter each other, I hope he can justi-
fy this ignorance in a future column.

First the BAS is upset with the PPC about
Daryl Gates, and now Holly C. Callender is
upset with me for referrirrg to Nadine Strossen,
the first female president of the ACLU, as a “rep-
resentative of the ACLU.” I meant no disrespect

by this omission. In point of fact I. also _clic,l,,not_ ,

state that Daryl Gates is the former police chief
of LA., a position he held for greater than 10

V 4 years. I did not mention these facts because

they were not relevant to the content of my let-
ter. My letter did not deal with the content of
the debate or the positions of the participants.

In addition, these facts were covered by, The Pitt,

It seems to me that Ms. Callender is upset
that I didn't mention Nadine Strossen “is, in fact,
the first female president of this large organiza-
tion” (the ACLU). Ms. Callender is just a mem-
ber of an overiy-sensitive special interest group
who is more concerned with advancing a politi-

cal agenda than confronting the actual issue of _

Homosexuality moi-allywrong
I am writing, in response to the subject of a
recent Perspective page .—— homosexuality. It
seems that both of the articles made the
assumption that homosexuality is acceptable. I
really don’t know where they are getting their

morals from. Although many will claim that it is ‘

“outdated,” the Bible clearly states that homo-
sexuality is wrong. It is sinful. This can be found
in Lev. 20, verse 13.

Nearly all of the founding fathers strongly felt
that American schools must maintain Bible-
based instruction or they would fail. They must
have had a great deal of insight.

The idea of promoting “diversity” and accept-
ing all others as unique individuals is ﬂawed; it
comes with a price. That price is the loss of any
true morals or claims of absolute truth. It also
comes with a lot of hypocrisy. All cultures are
not equally accepted by those who would all
themselves the most tolerant It’s great if you’re
Muslim or Jewish or really into Zen, but if
you’re a Christian, then somethings wrong.

I’ve never been the kind of a person
with a tenible afﬁnity for cats, and, as a
matter of fact, I’ve always held them with
a bit of contempt. It’s nothing personal,
butthey aren’t always the friendliest of
animals and it seems the only time they
show you affection is when they want
something.

Therefore, you could imagine my sur-
prise when I found out my parents were
inheriting one of these creatures. All I
could say was, ‘thank God I live six hours
away.’Being a member of the most
advanced species, I didn’t think a cat
could do anything to hint me. After all, I
have the ability to reason, and my intel-

lectual pursuits include more than just

chasing a ball of yarn around the living
room. Three—and-a—half years at the
University of Pittsburgh has brought me a
knowledge about Karl Marx, the
European Community, Keynesian eco-
nornics and the theory of money. Now I
don’t think any cat in the world can boast

— of achievements greater than those.

Little did I know, that I was about to be
proved wrong. This week, like everybody
else, I -"went home for I the last

lege career. Now that I’m graduating I

. find myself‘ saying “the, last.of this” and

,“tl_ie last of that” a lot these days. It all
began the moment my mother came

home from work. The first thing she did

upon entering the house (aside from
acknowledging the son she hadn’t seen
in a while) was clean the cats litter. After
picking up the cat’s (I’ll be polite) waste,
she went to dispose of it. Rather than
hearing the ﬂush of the toilet, I heard the
shrieking of my name.

Legal system
Two Mondays ago, Senator Harris
Wofford spoke. to an audience at. the

Stephen Foster Memorial about
“Initiating change: Public Policies and

* Institutions.” Emphasizing the irnpor-

tance of the new Democratic Congress
as a mandate for change, Wofford
assured us that Piesident—elect Clinton’s
national agenda includes the implemen-
tation of a comprehensive healthcare

plan which would cover the costs of -

healthcare for every U.S. citizen.
Currently, 15 percent of all Americans
do not hold insurance policies. These
people usually receive the medical
attention they need under the costly
_care_ of hospitals and clinics.
Unfortunately, many Americans are,
so concerned with what they’re not get-
tinggout of our medical system, that
they pay little attention to what they
actually could be handed. I lived for a

year in England where I-had researched

the National Healthcare System (NHS)
in the United Kingdom. The changes
implemented by the Thatcher adminis-
tration showed remarkable progress in
healthcare. The federal administration
was divided into local, regional and
area health authorities that worked
together to ensure that the peoples of
each particular region were receiving
adequate care and attention. Through a
policy of information sharing, these
authorities were able to target areas
within the country where a certain ill-
ness was most prevalent and worked to
deal with it. Doctors were assigned
patients (patients do not choose their

(doctors) and regions to work in.

However, because there was little com-
petition for patients and pay among
medical professionals, innovation and
opportunity for experimentation
tapered over the years. Inevitably the
number of physicians entering the force
also dwindled. As a result of the escalat-
ing costs of administrative and legal
processes, it soon became necessary for

THE PITI‘ NEWS, Monday November 30, 1992

Now that I'm graduating I wish I was a cat

Here my mother was, cleaning up the
waste of an animal which is allowed to

Brett
Gilrnan

defecate in the house, and I’m getting
yelled at for leaving the toilet seat up.
Something was wrong here, and my con-
tempt for Snickers grew even stronger. I
came to the conclusion that ifI wanted to
win the love of my parents back it was
going to be me against that cat. My'moth—
er then proceeded to go up the stairs, and
like__failure follows exams, followed
Snickers with the intention of feeding her.
At the moment when my mother began
to pay me an ounce of attention, the cat
began to meow (which is cat talk for
bitching) and run around the kitchen.
Once again, I was put on hold while my
mother fed Snickers. I, waslscared, and

the cat knew it. I was no longer my par-
ents’ favorite.

With a morsel of Nine Lives on its
whisker, Snickers looked at me with
piercing green eyes and a Dirty
Hanyesque smirk, and dared me to make
its day. That was it. I got the message.
The rest of the week, Snickers ruled the
house. Three-and—a—half years away from
home and I had been replaced I could
never go home again. The cat leaves its
toys all over the house; and no problem,
mom and dad clean them up. I go so far
as to leave the closet door open after
hanging up my coat and I might as well
be tamed and feathered.

Snickers sleeps all day and is constantly
reminded of how cute she is. I wake up

past 10 in the morning and am met with -

a banage of “\X/'akeup! \‘</hat do you want
to do sleep yoru' whole life away, you
burn?” -

You have to admit that there is some-
thing strange happening here. Is this hap-
pening to all graduating seniors or is it just
me? After all, I spent 18 years living under
the roof of my parents, and that cat has

been there only four. Aside from that, I g

was the result of their joined chromo-
somes-

I guess when it comes down to it, I’m
envious of my cat. It eats and sleeps all
day and manipulates my parents — the
same thing that I’ve been doing for years.
And while I have become “smarter,”
Snickers is the dominant one in this
household. 1 » " I

One more thing I envy about Snickers
is the fact that she has nine lives. I"m
graduating this May, and I have but one. I
better make this one count. A

has made health care sick

the Thatcher administration to close

down the local health authorities, there—_

by reducing funding. to local clinics and
often shutting them down. This made it
necessary for people living in rural or

Megan Heard

suburban areas to travel to the federally
run hospitals and clinics where doctors
became overworked and underpaid.
Preventative healthcare was tossed out
the window with the dissolution of the
local health authorities.

Physicians were only able to adminis-
ter care on a ﬁrst—come-first-serve basis,
and month-long waiting lists developed
for such simple operations as tonsillec-

V tomies. Today the NHS is atrocious.

People wait in line for hours with fes-
tering ﬂesh wounds and sick children.
After receiving the attention of only a
nurse, many are turned away only to
come back again with worsened condi-
tions because they did not receive ade-
quate care the first time. The bureaucra-
cy involved in such a system is stagger-
ing. Most of the federal attention and
funding goes into the administrative
and legal costs rather than the actual
medical purposes. ~

England is a country about the size of
Rhode Island. How then, can the
United States, which is by far larger in
tenns of population, insurance compa-
nies and private hospitals, hope to
coordinate a national system which will
cut the cost of care and continue the
practice of preventative medicine?
Wofford insists such a system wmrld
offer more options and choices for
Americans. .

He says that by establishing a single-
billing form we can cut down on paper-
work and administration costs. With the
number of insurance companies, poli-
cies and special interest groups in this
country, such a proposal would take

years to effect, and the administration
costs would be enormous. Even if we
do accomplish these proposals, without
seriously monitoring the administrative
aspects of the new system, the cost in

terms of the quality of human life will L

skyrocket.

We get what we pay for in this coun-
try, and in order to receive top—notch
care we’ve got to pay. However, I
heartily agree that the amount we’ve
got to pay is ridiculous. The -United
States ‘desperately needs to change its
healthcare policies, as existing ones are
exorbitant and exclusionary to 15 per-
cent of the population.‘

But, if we want to see change the.

reform must be initiated from the legal
sector. As much as it pains me to say’ it,
Dan Quayle was right in attacking the
American Bar Association last year in
using the legal system as a means of
making money rather than distributing
justice. Doctors currently pay hundreds
of thousands of dollars a year in mal-
practice insurance, which in turn
increases the cost of their bills.

Hospitals also pay outrageous sums,
again with the same effect. If we want
the price of healthcare to go down, we
must initiate programs to discourage
lawsuits against the medical profession.
Many of these cases deal with individ-
ual greed and a demand for compensa-
tion rather than actual malpractice.

Although Wofford does say that this
country needs a system for social inven-
tion and creativity which must start at a
local level, it is evident from the exam-
ples and explanations previously stated
that this country needs a system which
is uninhibited by legal restrictions which
lead to escalated costs and inefficient
practices.

Change must come from the federal
govemment, change must start with a
comprehensive interpretation of our
laws before we can hope to effect
wide—sweeping national programs.

Sunseri steps into nightmare
job as interim football coach

By’Rob Pugliese

Sports Assistant

Sal Sunseri is not inherit-
ing the most enviable of sit-
uations.

In fact, taking over the Pitt
football team even for just
one game could be viewed
as more of a nightmare. The
Panthers are a team lost in
total disarray at 3-8, buried
beneath the rubble of a 44-
point demolition at Penn
State and the free fall of a
four-game losing streak.

Now Pitt travels to Hawaii
— where even good teams
lose — and the Rainbows
are having an excellent sea-
son. ’

Somebody has to take
over as interim head coach,
and that lucky soul is
Sunseri. He will step up
from his current duties as
assistant head coach and
inside linebackers coach.

Sunseri became an All-
American linebacker at Pitt
during the Panther glory
days of 1979—’81. He was an
integral part of Pitt’s leg-
endary defenses that pro-
duced 35 victories over that
span. Sunseri was drafted by
the Pittsburgh Steelers in
1982, but a training camp
knee injury ended his pro
career prematurely, and
Sunseri moved into coach-
ing.

Winning formula works again as Steelers  over Bengals, 21-9

By Ryan Buncher
Sports Editor

It is ugly, but it works.

The Steelers’ formula for victory has
rarely changed this year. They play
strong defense, force the other team
into mistakes and take advantage of
them, make enough mistakes of their
own to keep things interesting, and
they let Barry Foster grind the other
team’s defense to shreds.

It was effective again yesterday as
Pittsburgh raised its record to 9-3 with a
21-9 win over the struggling Cincinnati
Bengals (4-8).

The mistake came first. After the
Steelers were forced to punt on their
first drive, the Bengals took the ball to
their own 40, where they faced a fourth
and one.

Cincinnati tried a fake punt on a
direct snap to upback Eric Ball. Ball
mishandled the ball. Steeler rookie
receiver Charles Davenport picked it

up, avoided punter Lee Johnson and
returned the ball 32 yards for the touch-
down and a 7-0 Steeler lead.

Ball came back with a big play on the
ensuing kickoff, a 48-yard return that set
the Bengals up near midfield. Rookie
quarterback David Klingler — seeing
his first NFL action — completed two
passes to Jeff Query to give Cincinnati a
first down at the Steeler 25.

Pittsburgh used what seemed like a
new weapon for them to stop the
Bengal drive —-— sacks. Gerald Williams,
in his first game back from a knee
injury, charged into the backfield and
dragged Klingler down at the 33. After a
nine-yard Klingler scramble, outside
linebacker Jerrol Williams came in

untouched and threw the rookie for an

12-yard loss forcing the Bengals to punt.

The Steelers had only 17 sacks enter-
ing the contest, but the black and gold
jerseys charged through a porous
Bengal line and rained down on
Klingler all day. on the way to a team-

record 10 sacks.

The team records the Steelers had in
mind going into the game were Franco
Harris’ all-purpose yardage and rushing
records for a single season. Foster
entered the game nine yards short of
the former and 30 yards short of the lat-
ter.

He came nowhere near either record
in the first quarter as the Bengals held
the Steeler halfback to two yards on
three carries.

Bengal halfback Harold Green broke
loose near the end of the quarter. After
Klingler finally threw an incomplete
pass (he completed his first five) on
second and three, Green ran five yards
for a first down. On the next play, he
busted into open field for a 34-yard
jaunt to the Steeler 29.

The Bengals moved to the 17 before
being stopped with the help of another
sack, this one by defensive end Donald
Evans. Cincinnati settled for a 33-yard
Jim Breech field goal to draw within

three. ‘

Foster got the first of Harris’ records
on the first play of the team’s next pos-
session. He ripped off 10 yards to pass
Harris’ team mark of 1,477 all-purpose
yards in a season, set in 1979.

The drive did not go much further,
due in large part to dropped passes by
Jeff Graham on consecutive plays.
Graham, who entered the game leading
the team with 35 receptions, was erratic
in his return after missing two games
due to injury.

The Steelers got the ball back after a
three-plays-and—punt Bengal possession.
Foster wasted no time breaking his sec-
ond team‘ record of the day, ripping off
16 yards around the left to become the
Pittsburgh’s all—time single-season rush-
er, passing Harris’ total of 1,246 yards in
1975.

After Pittsburgh moved to the
Cincinnati 30, the Steelers made one of
those mistakes that keeps games close.

Defense hurts Pens in erratic Week

\

Byjim Clark
Smﬂ‘ Writer

Over the past week, the
Penguins have experienced the
good, the bad and the ugly
while posting a 1-2 mark in the
three Patrick Division games.

The ugly came last
Wednesday. Kevin Stevens
returned after missing nine
games” with a knee injury, but
His return was overshadowed
by brilliant performances by
Mark Messier and Adam Graves
as the Rangers routed Pittsburgh
11-5 at the Civic Arena.

Messier scored two goals and
four assists while Graves scored
the hat trick to go along with
his two assists.

The reason the Penguins
were embarrassed against New
York can be summed up in two
words — defense and penalties.
The Rangers had countless two-
on—ones in the game to go
along with a few breakaways.
With goal scorers like Messier,
Graves, Darren Turcotte and

Tony Amonte the Rangers feast-

ed on these opportunities.

The Penguins also took too
many penalties in the game.
The Rangers had 10 power
plays, scoring on four of them.

Some of these penalties
would fall into the stupid cate-
gory. latry Murphy was sent off
in the first period for unsports—
manlike conduct and later in
the period for needlessly
elbowing a Ranger.

Late in the contest with the
game already out of reach, Rick
Tocchet took a double minor
for roughing as he tried to
pick a fight with the Rangers’
Kris King. T occhet received
another roughing call later in
the period.

New York scored on all three
of those penalties. The reason
for the Penguins’ success the
past two-and-a—half years is
their ability to play disciplined
hockey, but one would have
never known that by watching
Wednesday’s game.

Two‘ nights ‘later in

Washington, it was more of the
same as the Pens’ defense fal-
tered. The Penguins held a 3-1
lead, but the Capitals, led by
defenseman Al Iaftate, stormed
back with four unanswered
goals on the way to a 6-4 victo-
ry. Once again, Pittsburgh gave
up numerous two-on—ones and
even a three—on-one.

The Penguins redeemed
themselves Saturday back on
home ice. This time it was
Washington that blew the two-
goal lead as Pittsburgh won by
a ﬁnal of 5-5.

The Penguins played the
game without defenseman Kjell
Samuelsson, who was injured
the previous night when he
blocked a Capital shot. The
Pens relied extensively on four
defensemen: Murphy, Ulf
Samuelsson, Jim Paek and Paul
Stanton.

Despite allowing 39 shots to
Washington, the four played a
strong game. Murphy collected
three assists and was named the

~ game’s number one star.

stale air of apathy throughout the
Oakland community. He had to
go.

What next? Looking for Mr.
Right. But first, a word from the
past.

Exorcism of a Nice Guy

Abbey Road revisited —— Paul
is dead.

To nab a verse from an old
Rod Stewart tune, “It seems like
a long, long time.”

Has it been just three years
since a Gatorade-drenched Paul
Hackett was carried off the field
following a 51-28 come—from—
behind win over Texas A&M in
the John Hancock Bowl? Has it
been three years since Pitt had
an important victory?

Echoing the sentiments of the
ex-coach himself — “Wow!”

To call the downfall of the Pitt
program under his optimistic-
but—uninspiring leadership a fall
from grace wouldbe, well, gia-
cious. Falling on your face, hard
and fast,\is more appropriate.

But in looking back at the
whole situation — the alleged

forcing-out of a man who tried
to do what the Athletic

"Department asked him to do —

it is sad really. When you think
about what Hackett stands for —
what he tried to do with this suc-
cessful-but—semi-sadistic program
—— you cant help feel for the
guy.

It’s not like the administration
didn't know his attitude about
success on the ﬁeld. For God's
sake, they printed his positive
“winning isn’t everything” mes-
sage in this year’s media guide.

“Winning isn’t the only thing,”
Hackett is quoted. “It’s the will-
ingness to prepare yourself to
win which is the most important
thing  It’s not whether you
won or not, it’s that you pre-
pared yourself the best you
could to be in a position to win.”

That does not mean Hackett
didn’t know the bottom line,
though.

“However, at Pitt, we do
expect to win,” he said.

If only the Athletic Department
and boosters would have

ugly pass that Bengal safety
David Fulcher intercepted at
the two-yard line.

The reprieve for the Bengals
did not last long. The Steelers

for the inside linebacker in the
game. Levon Kirkland missed
on a chance to block the punt

Woodson was able to return it
to the Bengal 30.

Foster charged off the right
side and rumbled inside the
five. Two plays later, he ran
over defensive back Daryl
Williams and spun into the end
zone on a four-yard touchdown
run. ‘

Klingler ran a near-perfect
two minute drill to allow
Breech to kick a 42-yard field
goal as time ran out for a 14-6

halftime score. The drive was
aided when officials did not
charge the Bengals with a time-
out even though Klingler called
for one early in the drive. They
used the extra break after a run
by Green moved the ball to the
Steeler 25 with less than 10 sec-
onds remaining.

The Steelers failed to score
after taking the ball in Bengal
territory on their first posses-
sion of the second half. On

44, they lost five Yards on a

Pittsburgh to the one.

On the next play, fullback
Merril I-loge got trapped in a
pile-up and fumbled, blowing
yet another scoring chance for
the Steelers.

The Steelers started their
third straight drive in Bengals’
side of the field after another
Johnson punt. Two runs by
Foster and a leaping catch by
Graham moved the Steelers to
the 18.

The Steelers got another first
down on an offsides penalty
called on Fulcher (even though
linebacker Gary Reasons
was the one who crossed the
line). Linebacker James Francis
interfered with tight end Adrian
Cooper in the end zone, mov-
ing the ball to the one.

Foster took a pitch right and
lunged through a tackle for his
second touchdown and a 21-6
lead- —

Klingler’s passing and a 24-

yard burst by Green set up a
33-yard _Breech field goal for
the final 21-9 %core.

The Steelers moved inside
the Bengal 50 on their next
drive, mostly on a 27-yard pre-
cision pass from O’Donnell to
Dwight Stone and two out pat-
terns to Graham, but Gary
Anderson missed a 49-yard
field goal attempt.

Greg Lloyd charged into the
backfield and nailed Klingler
on the ensuing Bengal drive.
That tied the Steeler record
with nine sacks in a game;
Number 10 came as time was
about to run out whenstrong
safety Carnell Lake took
Klingler down as the quarter-
back scrambled out of the
pocket. ’

Foster racked up 102 yards
on 25 Carries on his record—set-
ting day. It was his ninth 100-
yard game of the season,

another team record. He now

leads the NFL with 1,519 yards
rushing on the season.

The Steelers held their two-
game lead in the AFC Central
over the Oilers, who beat
Detroit Thanksgiving day. The
lead is more commanding since
the Steelers would win a tie-
breaker with Houston by virtue
of their two victories over the
Oilers.

The Steelers are also tied for
the best record in the AFC

because the Buffalo Bills lost in -

overtime to the Indianapolis
Colts. The Bills would get the
home advantage in the playoffs
if they end in a tie with
Pittsburgh due to Buffalo’s 28-
20 win over the Steelers three
weeks ago.

The formula did not work
that day, but it has nine times
—— enough to put the Steelers
in position to win their first
division title since 1984. Maybe
it is not so ugly after all.

look at the Pitt job will show a
few wrinkles most coaches
would not want to deal with.

First, the acceptance require-
ments for student—athletes com-
ing to Pitt are substantially higher
than other NCAA Division I-A
schools (2.3 grade point average
and 750 SAT score compared to
2.0 and 700).

Second, Pitt doesn’t have the
freedom to wheel and deal for a
veteran coach demanding major
league bucks — having blown
its financial wad on three ex-
coaches already.

Let’s see, recruiting restrictions
and lower salary. Oh, Oh! I’ll do

Oklahoma Coach Barry Switzer.
But with each man’s respective
age, price—range and reputation,
