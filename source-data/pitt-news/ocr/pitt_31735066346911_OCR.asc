Frick Fine Arts Building Proposed

Four Honored At Commencement‘

City Council
Asked to Allow

Schenley Site

The University announced
last week that it is presenting
plans to City Council for a
new fine arts building which
will be donated by Miss Helen

C. Frick in memory of her
late father.

According to Miss Frick, the
new building will be called the
Henry Clay Frick Fine Arts Build-
ing and its art collections will be
intended for community as well
as University use.

Having its collections accessible
to the general public, the Univer-
sity will seek permission to erect
the building on a site near the en-
trance to Schenley Park.

City Council Asked

City Council will be asked to
permit construction at a site near
Junction Hollow Bridge and
across the road from the Carnegie
Library and Museum building.
The area is part of the tract of
land acquired by the City from
Mary E. Schenley as an addition
and entrance to the park. The
deed grants the City the power
to permit the use of portions of
the land.

If approved, groundbreaking
will take place early in the fall
in conjunction with ceremonies
marking the 175th anniversary
of the University.

The building has been desig-
nated by architects B. Kenneth
Johnstone Associates in stone and
tile to harmonize with present
biuldings in the area. It will con-
tain 57,000 square feet of floor
space and will be built around a
large, open-air “cloister” in the

remaining $5,763,000. We plan to

loolring Back

Among the nearly twelve hundred students who will
receive bachelor’s degrees at Monday’s commencement
exercises are the last of those who began when the Univer-
sity offered only a four year program.

A week after the freshman class of 1958 matriculated,
adoption of the trimester system was announced. Theirs and
the freshman class following them were given opportunity
to pioneer the three-term school year which went into ef-
fect in the fall of 1959. Some accepted the dare and relin-
quished their summers; the rest receive their diplomas
Monday.

But before Monday’s alumni even attended their first
classes, Chancellor Litchfield revealed plans for long-range
campus development. Forbes Avenue would be rerouted,
Bigelow Boulevard would be foreshortened, a library build-
ing, a compound of professional schools and new dormitor-
ies would be erected. Target date for the expansion’s comple-
tion—-l962. ,

The Chancellor’s time estimate now seems to have been
a little too ambitious. Oakland objectors and Renaissance
goals in other areas were retarding factors. But with the

« Allegheny Redevelopment Conference's inclusion of the Uni-
versity’s needs in their Oakland master plan, the Chancel-
lor’s 1958 announcement is only postponed reality.

Monday’s graduates will leave with the University an-
nouncing an addition only slightly overshadowed by that
which heralded their arrival. The Henry Clay Frick Fine
Arts Building will expand the University’s physical and
intellectual boundaries even further than in the 1958 plans
envisioned. It points to a’ time in the distant future when all
or most of the individual disciplines, not just each of the
schools, will reside in its own building.

The class of 1962 paid cash for their role in the Univer-

_ sity’s expansion spectacle: they were the second entering
' class to pay a nine dollar tuition increase; they felt another
five dollar raise in 1960; now they are just escaping a third
fee increment. .
Whether or not they feel they got their money’s worth,
r Monday’s alumni have seen an impressive show. Perhaps the
class of 1966 will be able to say the same thing.

‘ Back now (alas) to the majority.

 

---------An American Tragedy . . :

Men Need Mending

  
  

 
  
    

    

 

By Jane Bennett

As an American female, I have been for some
years now a critical observer of the American male.
And critical is right, I have reached the sorry con-

clusion that the majority of American men fall
into two categories, which I list
as the sock ads and the invisi-
bles. There is a minority group ,‘
but I will come to them later.

How do I define my two groups?

Well, all American men -look
more or less (mostly more)
alike. But some are better

dressed than others. This better
dressed group resembles adver-
tisements for men's hose, and
each other. The sock ads have
the advantage for they at least look like something,
making them one up, or maybe one-half upon the
invisibles. These are the poor fellows who, when we
see them out walking with a bleached blond in a
vermillion dress. seem a sort of pale shadow on the
down-side of the walk. Or they are the short haired,
cleanshaven fellows who just seem to blend quiet-
ly into the patched brown leather street car seats.

Interests Alike

It is not only the outside of the American man
that makes him fade, however. In all other things,
his speech, his manners, his interests are so like all
others that he is neither much noticed nor long
remembered.

Have you ever been at a gathering when a
European male walks through the crowd and all
female heads are turned to look after him? Why?
Because there is something different about him.
He is not afraid to be a man. He is himself and
proud of it, it's his world to make or break, or be

The Security of War. .

 

 

broken by, not someone else’s world. in which-A
must be a neat fixture or go unseen. B A’

Right about now you are probably saying, wa
a minute lady —— who's fault is it that the Ameri
can man is like this. It's the American woman’;
fault you say. They force men to conform to
standard of dress and action set up by the adverti
ing council. Oh they do, do they? Men should lmo
by now that women will push them as far as they
will go, just to see how far that is. But on
they get you to the wall (where most America
men now stand showing off their ivy-green orldt;
anklets to best advantage) the fun is over. it

Men have allowed women to cut their own
throats. And the men are caught in the middle. 
woman who has beaten them down will soon 
off and look for something interesting.

A Third Group

And what is interesting? This is where the small
third group of American males comes in. These are
the men who are different in some way —— in any
way even. Witness the female mania for a TV-
charactcr (not a real man even) named Ben Casey
who is sweeping women off their emotional feet '
because he is ill—tcmpercd.

But here and there on the American scene there
can be found a man who is yet an individual; a 9,
man who wears a beard because he looks better 
with a beard, or who hates baseball or prefers wine i
to beer. And best of all the courage to'tell a
woman to get out if she doesn't like it. But she
probably does like it. And so do a dozen others,
if you could make them tell the truth about it. Most
women would, or should, prefer this man if just
for the feeling that he is really there and not paint- _
ed into the scenery. It might be interesting to see
an America where men are men and not pictures
from the Father's day adds in McCalls.

   
 

   
 
 
 

   
 
 
    
  

   
 
 

  
 
 
 

 
   
 
    
 

  
  
 
      
           
     
     
 
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
 
 
    
    

 
  
  
  
    
  
 

War On Peace

I

First of all, before you read another word, I
want you to stop and take a careful account of
yourselves and the world, and determine some ﬁrm,
courageous convictions. I‘ll give you a couple min-
utes . . . Ready? Okay, then let's
not toy with such playthings as
SANE and the other let‘s-all-be-
nice-and—it’ll-all-be-OK groups.
The fine workers of the DAB,
the American Legion and the
Birchers will handle that sort of
foolishness; let us discuss that
long neglected area: the practi-
cality of war. A

I, for one, would like to see
all that money we send for for-
eign aid go for some real American project like
housing troops, staging USO_ shows with otherwise
unemployed actors, and giving chocolate to or-
phans. If we really must do something overseas,
and if we are still determined not to give away
our surplus food (which, as any right thinker
knows, is our deterrent in the population explo-
sion), then war is a lot better than allowing our
cash to loaf in the pockets of leaders of unfriendly
nations.

Arty Art’

, Also, war gives the arts something to be really
arty about, which is terribly important, especially
if we want a cultured culture. It gives the artists
a point on which they can focus their praise and
damnation. And it helps the critics, also, because
they also are forever searching for points of focus,
new areas to which art work can also be‘;-elated,

War leads to full employment —- or total unem-
ployment. In either case, this is equality, this is

of, conclusion.

Now, here are some random points to prepare
you for the breath-taking impact of my major
points: We can frighten people. We can add direc-
tion to our lives. We can get to see the world. We
can have an honest cry. and we can have parades,
and stirring music, and get excited as hell, and
take out our hatreds on other people besides
mothers, and wives, and Negroes, and Jews, and
Protestants, and Catholics, and homosexuals, and
Norman Mailer, and the Chancellor, and Jack Lon-
don, and Sammy Davis, Jr., and shoe repairmcn,
and Princess Grace, and Chubby Checkers, and
Mahler. and a couple others, too.

Now for the stunning points: calculated to leave
you gasping, clutching your first edition of the

By JOSEPH GREIF

For iivc nights last week, the
Student Union Ballroom took on
the atmosphere of the 18903 in
England and the appearance of
the rooms of a young man at col.
logo. This setting was placed be-
fore the University audience for
the performance of “Charley's
Aunt," a farce by Brandon Thom-
as.

In the story, Jack Chesney,
played by Len Goodman, and
Charley Whkeham, played by Bill
Kennedy, are in love with two
young ladies. They wish the
young ladies to Stay at Jack's
rooms long enough for Jack and
Charley to build up courage to
propose to them. As the young
ladies will not stay without a
chaperone, Charley tells them his
aunt is arriving shortly.

Babs Takes Over

However, Charley’s aunt tele-
graphs that she cannot make it.
Jack and Charley hit on the idea
of letting their friend Lord Fan-
court Babberly, affectionately call-
ed “Babs." play the role of Char-
ley‘.~; aunt. As soon as Babs re-
luctantly assumes his role as
Charley's aunt, Donna Lucia D’-
Alvadorez, the laughs come con-
tinuously until the very end when
he reappears in trousers.

George Manei's impersona-
tion of Charley‘: aunt was bril-
liant. He was eflective as the
old lady trying to dodge two
proposals of marriage, while
simultaneously trying to help
the two young ladies attain
their wishes for marriage to
Jack and Charley. Manei used
every line and every action to
project an image of an overly
charming Spanish lady trom

Brazil. “where the nuts come
from." The image was crystal
clear.

Also deserving of recognition is
Bill Kennedy for his portrayal of
Charley. He was consistent in
character and followed the ac-
tion wcll when he was not a part
(if 

The three young ladies. Pat
Cratty. as Kitty Verdun: Vrcneli
Marti, as Amy Spcttigue; and
Channa Newman, as Ela Dclahay,
were both alluring and pleasant.
Rik Pierce played the part of
Jack’s father, an old English mili-
tary, officer, and handled the role
convincingly. Others in the cast
were Jeff Rash, Harvey Stone and
Ardith Regdon. The play was di-
rected by Bernard Engel.

Seated On Three

The cast played to an audience
seated on three sides of the set.
Since it is fairly difficult to pro-
ject the human voice in three di-
rections at one time, this arrange-
ment provided some unfortunate
blind spots in the performance
when the audience in one area
would miss part of the dialogue.
There was also an attempt at an
English accent by some, but not
all, of the characters. Even the
actors who started with the ac-
cent seemed to lose it intermit-
tently. It would have been better
to omit it completely from the
performance.

Between the acts, the scenery
was changed with a musical back-

1962 Directory
Tells of Jobs

The Institute of Local Govern-
ment of the University has recent-
ly published the 1962 Directory
of Pennsylvania Council Manager

Municipalities and Municipal
Managers.
The directory contains data

about the jobs and jobholders in
117 Pennsylvania municipalities
using a managerial form of gov-
ernment.

According to the new directory,
the average annual salary of
Pennsylvania municipal managers
rose nearly $1000 from 1958 to
1962. Average annual salary this
year amounts to $8622.

The number of communities
with managerial government has
grown from 58 in 1953 to more
than double that number, 117, in
1962, but in the past ten years
only nine communities abandoned
the managerial system.

After Season

Neil Shorthouse Goes
Balmy Following That
Horrendous 0-10 Year
By JIM O’BRIEN

A puff of sand punctuated
the air above a deep bunker,
and diminutive Neil Short-
house, heretofore unseen,
peered out to watch the flight

. of the golf ball.

Kerplunk! The
plopped
in a waterhole
75 feet away.
Shorth 0 u s e,
Pitt’s No. 1
golfer, flincbed
his eyes. He
probably would
have liked to
fall backward
in the bunker,
and have a
ben e v 01 e n t
groundskeeper fill it in.

That's the way things have been
going all year for the captain of
the horrendous linksmen (0-10).
The season began with a 26-0
wash-out to Ohio State and was
climaxed with a 7-0 setback by
Penn State. P

Worst Record

And Neil, personally, had his
worst spring: He made a brilliant
indisputable observation on the
year: “We probably had the worst

 

N. Shorthouse

record - percentage-wise —- of
any team in the history of the
school."

He said things couldn‘t be
much different here. You got
the impression that he was re-
ferring to a school where golf
means as much as cricket, curl-
ing and polo. “They only had
one guy on scholarship,” he
said. “and he was a hacker --
that was me”

“After a while it wasn’t even
frustrating, that means there’s
hope -— and then it fades away
at the end. This year wasn’t a
frustration —- there never was any
hope." -

Neil himself had an oil-season,
charting a 4-6-1 mark. “I beat
West Virginia twice,” he said.
“That was my only conso1ation.”

Penn State, which finished the
season with 11 wins had an in-
teresting observation on the Pitt
team in their Daily Collegian.
Noting that Pitt had players
named McSor1ey, McBride and
McCullough it read “defeat was as
common as the Scotch prefix on
their names.”

But they forgot Shorthousc. That
name tells the whole story.

Coach Bill Kaliden
Gets Prize Star

In his junior year at Pitt, Coach
Bill Kaliden, then a quarterback,
tossed a late-minute 52—yeard
to beat Penn

 

State, 14-13.

The pass was completed in All-
American Richie Lucas’ territory.

Now it seems that Kaliden has
‘caught State and Richie sleeping
again.

It has been announced that
Glassport’s deluxe-thrower, . Ken-
ny Lucas is enrolling here 1n the
fall on a football scholarship. Kali-
den did all the recruiting for
Richie’s brother. .

“Facial-wise, he looks just like
his brother,” Kaliden recalled.
“He’11 grow as big, and right now
I think he’s a better passer. I
also like him on film as a defen-
sive back.”

Kaliden remarked that they
have a film in which Lucas C0111‘

pleted “something like 18 straight
passes."

Since that time Hefferle has
put a few notches on his coach-
ing belt. He coached at Pitt a few
years back. for Boston College
and the Washington Redskins, and
now back at Pitt again.

He is responsible for a golden
era in Panther ends-—-Mike Ditka,

rival fast approaching Penn State

Almost Entire Team

Returns Next Year

Bobby Lewis’ baseball team
ended the season on a successful
note by scoring two wins last
week, over Kent State and Alle-
gheny, to end the campaign with
an 11-5 record against college

competition and an overall chart
of 13-6.

It was a vast improvement for
the mitters over last season’s dis-
astrous. 5-10 record. The final two
wins of the season were typical
of the Pitt squad in that fine
pitching prevailed.

Jim Sylvis held Kent State to
one run as his teammates were
shut out for eight frames against
Kent State but hard hitting Corky
Cuthbert saved Sylvis from de-
feat by blasting a two-run homer
in the ninth to give the Panthers
a 2-1 triumph.

New Record

Last Saturday the Panthers re-
versed an early season loss to
Allegheny in vengeful style by
drubbing the Gators 13-1. John
Carlisle was nearly untouchable
in going the route and striking out
16.

Leading the 13-run barrage

~ was third baseman Paul Martha

who had a perfect day at the
plate with three hits in three
times at bat.

While an 11-5 record is nothing
to be ashamed of, Lewis and his
team can look forward to even
better times next year since loss-
es by graduation are very few.

Lose Three

Co-captain and lcftﬁelder Drew

Williamson, and relievers Ralph

Shutterly and Larry Carra are
the only mitters that will not be
around next season.

Returning will be such stand-
out batters as Al Riccuiti, Cuth-
burt and Ron Supansic, who
have already proven themselves
to be top-notch batsmen.

The year of experience gained
by John Cioffi, Paul Martha, Dick
Wagner and Ray Barton should
enable them to be better hitters
in 1963.

On the mound is where the
Panthers should really shine
next year. All three of Lewis‘
starters, John Carlisle, Jim Syl-
via and Andy Alex will be back.

Carlisle displayed form that
made him one of the best pitchers
in the East and if he can continue
to turn down the large bonus of!-
ers that major league teams are
offering him he should develop
into one of, if not the best pitchers
Bobby Lewis has ever coached.

Sylvis and Alex have shown
themselves to be more than cap-
able hurlers and should be tough
to beat next year. Some talented
sophomore pitchers will be back
to lend assistance to these three
and make the 1963 team one with
strong tourney potential.

Disproves ‘Achilles Heel’ Tale '
Al Thomassey Throwing Weight
Around Despite Ankle Injury

Discus Thrower
Finished Strong

By FRED MARCUS

Thin-cl_ad Al Thomassey’s
ankle has defied the tradition
set down in the legend of
Achilles’ heel. Whereas the
latter never would heal,
Thomassey’s ankle responded
to treatment faster thna expected.

After the solidly-built discus
thrower sustained a double frac-
ture of his ankle, the doctor said
that he “wouldn't have much
chance to compete this year." He
added that “he would have to be
on crutches for two week" after
the cast was off.”

It turned out, however, that he
needed no support, and about one-
and-one-half weeks after the leg
was out of the cast, Thomassey
was able to ‘compete in the Pitt-
West" Virginia-Syracuse meet.

Hinder-ed Tosses

"The first few weeks after I re-
turned to the team,” Thomassey
recalled, “the ankle hindered my
throwing, and before that I had
to miss several practices because
of it."

A Liberal Arts student who
3 91311”!!! of majoring in chem-

istry. he stands a tall six foot-
one and weighs 200 pounds.

He barely missed scoring some
aces in the ICQA meet at Villa-
nova and the Central Collegiates
held at South Bend this year.
He took a fifth in the first meet
and a second place in the second.

[Hurdler Joe Friend also took
second in the 120-yard hurdles].

He threw the discus 157 and
one-half feet in the Central Col-
legiates for his longest toss of the
season. Although this mark is a
long 12 feet off the school record,
Thomassey will have a season of
varsity experience under his belt,
plus a healed ankle, when he steps
into the throwing circle next year.

ceding year, when I come to the last column of the season, I
come to a problem.

My contract with the makers of Marlboro calls for me to
write a humor column and, truly, I do the best I can-all things
considered, I am not, I should explain, a jolly man by nature.
Why should I be? First of all, I am shorter than everybody.
Second, there are moths in my cashmere jacket. Third, I work
in television.

All the same, when it comes time to write this column, I light
a good Marlboro Cigarette, put aside my trauma, and try with
all the strength in my tiny body to make some jokes. Some-
times it works better than others, but on the last column of the
year, it just ﬂatly doesn’t work at all.

Even in the very beginning this was true--and that, you will re-
call, was eight years ago when I was relatively young and strong
and had not yet developed that nasty knock in my transmission.
Well do I remember sitting down to write the final column of my
first year. Day followed barren day, and not a yock, not a boff,
not a singer did I produce. I was about to give up humor and
take a job selling mechanical dogs when all of a. sudden, in a
blinding ﬂash, I realised why I couldn't think of any jokes!

I leapt up from my typewriter and ran as fast as my little
fut legs would carry me to the makers of Marlboro Cigarettes,
and I tugged my forelock, and I said, “Sits, I am well aware
that you have engaged me to write a humor column, but today,
as I approach the final column of the season, I am far too misty
to be funny, for the final column of the season is, after all, a
leave-taking, and when I think of saying goodbye to my audience
-the swellwt audience any columnist ever had-the college
students of America-wonderful human beings, every man and

woman of them--wise but kindly:-astute but compassionate-3‘
perspicacious but forbea.ring—-when, sirs, I think of saying good-
bye to such an audience, I am too shook up even to consider
levity, and so I ask you, airs, to let me, in the ﬁnal column of the

year, forego humor and instead write a simple, digniﬁed, ,

straightforward farewell.”
Then I took out my bandanns, wiped my eyes, ears, nose, and
throat and waited for a reply from the makers of Marlboro.
They sat around the polished board room table, the makers,
their handsome brows knit in concentration, pufiing thought-
fully on the Marlboros in their tattooed hands. At length they
spoke. “Yes,” they said simply. ‘

I never doubted they would say yes. People who make a I

cigarette as good as Marlboro must themselves be good. People

who lavish such care on blending tobeccos so mild and ﬂavor- ,
ful, on devising a ﬁlter so clean and white, on boxing a ﬂip-top f
box so ﬂip-top, on packing a soft pack so soft-people like that

are one hundred percent with mel ,'

And so from that day forward, the ﬁnal column of the year
—-including the one you are, I devoutly hope, now reading-—
makes no attempt to be funny, but is instead a simple thank
you and au revoir. 1

Thank you and an revoir, makers of Marlboro. The memory
of our eight years together will remain ever fresh in my heart,
and I would like to state for all the world to hear that if you
want me back again next year, I shall expect; a substantial
raise in salary. ~

Thank you and au revoir, college students of America. May
good luck attend all your ventures. Stay well. Stay happy.
