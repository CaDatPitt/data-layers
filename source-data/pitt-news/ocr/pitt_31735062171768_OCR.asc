vol. 65, no. 54

by ELLEN GANLEY

Bernadette Devlin is small in
physical appearance. But, accord-
ing to many who heard her Mon-
day, her knowledge, sincerity,
and concern are huge.

At 1 p.m. in the Carnegie Mu-

. sic Hall, Devlin presented Pitts-

burgh with the troubles of North
Ireland and " contrasted her
homeland’s woes with a number
of the problems now facing
America.

She began her speech by as-
serting that the religious crisis
now.facing North Ireland is a
problem that dates back to med-
ieval times.

The North Ireland of today
consists of one half million
Catholics and one million Protes-
"tants. A number o.f solutions have
been advanced, such as massive
atheism and complete freedom
for the people, but Bernadette
argued that these measures would
not alleviate the problem.

According to Devlin, the alleg-

ed misery of the Irish people-
one that traverses religions is
the main call to rebellion. Devlin
stated that in Northern Ireland,
there is a 10 percent rate of un-
employment. This figure is a 1
percent increase over last year
and has not been below 71/2 per-
cent in 50 years.

Bernadette said that “After hav-
ing your family live through 50
years of being in the ‘W2 percent
(of unemployed), the working
class gains a feeling of inferior-
ity and then the feeling that
something is rotten in society.”

“Religious conflicts do not ap-
pear in the upper class,” Berna-
dette contended, “but the upper
class is the basis of the problems
of the working class.” She went
on to explain that 5 percent of
the population of North Ireland
owns 85 percent of the property
in that country. Bernadette de-
clared that “it seems a little un-
fair that .95 percent of us have to
quibble over the last 15 percent.“

Social Commissioner Lenny
Klavonic has been appointed to
the Youth Advisory Council of
the Justice Department. The ‘I5

member group will consult peri-
odically with Attorney General
John Mitchell on ,Campus atti-
tudes.

K reskin To Perform

sensory perception (ESP), will

ghosts, levitation and reincarna-
tion.

A graduate of Seton Hall. he
has perfected the science of
“psychosonics." the sound of
mind. The mentalist has his own
syndicated television program.
“The Amazing Kreskin. “

The adult game entitled “Kres-
kin’s ESP” has sold over two mil-
lion sets; there is also an LP on
sale called “Basic Principles of
Kreskins ESP.“

“I don‘t hypnotize people
anymore. because it finally
dawned on me that there is
nothing on earth you can do
with a person ‘hypnotized’ that
you can‘t do with him wide
awake.” said Kreskin. -

He believes that some of the
most widespread use of sugges-
tion or hypnosis is found in ad-
vertising.

The program Friday will be
sponsored by the ‘SUB Public
Affairs Committee.

   

The tiny Irishman pointed out
that the problems of the working
class are not limited to her home-
land. “95 percent of America and
for that matter the world are
members of the working class
and it’s time we realized that we
are a democratic majority."

She further argued that “the
truth of it is that your (America)
problem is the same as ours. In
Ireland, it is easier to survive if
you are Protestant because you
believe in the myth a Protest-
ant government is run for the
Protestants. Here it is easier to
stand the government because
you are white and President
Nixon is white.“

Continuing; Bernadette declar-
ed, “If Angela Davis is guilty
of murder by buying weapons
that were used to kill a judge,
then President Nixon is respon-
sible for the assassination of 50,-
000 young Americans.”

“The oppressors of the work-
ing class, that small 5 percent,
aren’t interested in our bodies
or souls,” she added “but are
only concerned with the cold hum
of machinery that produces hard
profits, hard interest. and hard
power."

Bernadette Devlin, a firey and
magnetic personality, concluded
her speech by presenting her
rapt listeners with two questions.
The first ‘was, “Can the work-
ing class make the world any
worse than it is now?" Her final
query “Is it wrong for the ruling
class to be a democracy of 95 per-
cent of the population?“

After she rather uneasily
accepted a standing ovation, Ber-
nadette Devlin, a wee but fervid
champion of the working man
walked slowly from the stage
with her clenched fist raised in
the universal revolutionary salute.

Students To Determine

Future of Recess

A selected student referendum
is slated to determine the status
of the election recess, establish-
ed last summer.

Jane Thompson of the Citizen-
ship Information Center (CIC)
announced, “An undergraduate
sampling of various large classes
at either 10 or 11 in the morn-
ing, the peak hours, on March 8
or 10 will give the students a
chance to decide the issue for
themselves."

Youth Urged To Register

The various alternatives to be

presented are a two-day recess V  v

with the time being made up

during the reading period; a one .

day recess with the time com-
pensated for in the’ University
calendar as a regularly-scheduled
occasion; and the final choice
of no election day recess at all.

Thompson explained, “Under— j "

graduates will decide, as they are

the only ones that the recess

would matter to or affect.”

Passed by the Federal Govern-
ment is a bill which allows 18-
year-olds to vote in federal
elections, but their status in state
elections is to be determined by
their respective states.

Presently in Pennsylvania,
two emergency amendments
have been proposed, one to low-
er the voting age to 19, and an-
other to lower it to 18. Since
they are emergency amendments,
the legislation has only to pass
both state houses once, by a
two-thirds vote before it quali-
fies for the final voice of the
state referendum. The status of
the amendments is presently
undermined before the legisla-
ture.

that has urged thousands of Nor-

fight for civil rights. There was

Bernadette talked of her. re-

four months for having used
harsh language towards police-

she benefitted from the “experi-

“The regimentation of being
in prison is an exaggerated form
of society,” she said.

“We even had to ask per-.

The civil rights crusader also
learned in prison to consider the

law itself unjust.

“None of the prisoners was

Asked how she felt when people
call her a saint or a savior, she
quickly snapped, “It annoys me
that they’re so stupid. As I’ve
said before, I’m neither a saint
nor a very interesting sinner.”

Bernadette is not frightened
by the potential danger of dem-
onstration.

“You don't have time to be

be done. You have to notify the
police of all your plans-how far

GRIP Grapples With Refuse

What do you do with 5,000
tons of garbage? If you dumped
the ball
park would be filled in only 10
days. Every county resident pro-
duces an average of 38 pounds
of refuse a week.

This problem is faced by Alle-
gheny County daily. Dr. Neal
Timm and his wife, along with
other concerned citizens, offer
a simple solution to the problem.
The principle is proposed by the

Mrs. Timm reports that 6,000-

and 1,000 pounds of tin are
collected weekly at the Oakland

The paper is donated to the

The environment benefits from

Experimentation
by CHARLES WALTER
DRAMASTAFF
The first. and probably the most
interesting of the dance productions

(preceeding The Shakers and At The
Hawk’s Well) presented at Studio The-
atre this week is Cluster At The Center
by Messiaen. Under the direction of
choreographer Jeanne Beaman each of‘
the eleven dancers interprets directions
programed by a computer to varying

rhythms, light patterns, and at times

- tiring headmusic.

It may be meant as a comment on
modern technological society. but to
try to pin it down should be a mistake
as its construction invites any member
of interpretations
this one’s a must). The dancers exert a

skilled control and display a confi-
dencein their motions. - i A
'Mention should be made of John

Paskewicz‘s set design which puts in an
absolutely “fascinating performance.”

THE LEADER

The third presentation, The Leader. an
avante garde _play by Ionesco is a com-
ment on hero worship and loss of self
in the process. The dancers, under the
choreography of Jo Bravick, did so well
technically that it was difficult to inter-‘
pret the story of the show itself.

Wednesday, February 17,‘ 1971-—-THE PITT NEWS-—-Page 3

. I found myself so engrossed in the
individual movements (or fantasizing
via the dance tights) that the point of it
all drifted off somewhere. I believe
the audience felt slightly intimidated
sitting back watching the dancers’ doing
their own little thing on stage not letting
us in on it. An extreme lack of balance
is apparent in that the audience did not
become aware of what the action was
all about until the very end.

A PLEASANT SURPRISE

The evening took a surprising up--
swing with The Shakers choreographed
by Doris Humphrey and reconstructed
from the Labanotation score by K. Dumk-
ley. It is a replica of the dance worship
used by the now obscure shakers re-
ligious sect. The dancers literally “shake
with the spirit of the lord."

The objectives of The Shakers was
to recreate this powerful spiritual mood.
Emotion becomes intensified. and the
audience is drawn in and carried
through the spirutual “cleansing” up to
the end. Vocalist Ellen Hopkins. Accor-
dianist Guy Donatelli and drummer
Betty Malezi deserve a great deal of
credit for making The ‘Shakers
high point that it is.

All the institutions, sooner or
later will come prey to the revo-
lutionary pen. Even football. For
some, the spectre of men fight-
ing “it" out on a field of Astro-
Turf every Friday. Saturday,
Sunday and Monday is a sicken-
ing experience. For others it is
a natural pastime.

Football is the American sport,
democracy the American game.
Every once in a while the players
get a little angry. What do they
doito tell everybody else about
the wrong aspects? If they get
the chance, they write a book.

Sports Illustrated, Time In-
corporated’s throwing arm, has
run full feature articles concern-
ing racism and drugs in college
and professional athletics. Even
the establishment is question-

ing at times. David Meggyesy

is no reporter. But as a former
St. Louis Cardinel linebacker,
he ought to know what he’s
talking about.

In Out Of Their League he
makes the following charges:

—That football players on the
college and professional levels

are given drugs to aid their per-

formance. Benzedrine, Ampheti-
mines and Tranquilizers are dis-
tributed ‘ freely. Anabolic Sty-
roids which supposedly build
one up can lead to loss or sexual
desire and sickness.‘ Injured _play-

ers are shot up with pain killers

and sent back "into combat fur-
ther themselves, sometimes per-
manently.

Meggysey describes one par-
ticular instance when he injur-
ed his neck and had to have
some Novacaine shots. The
needle broke when his neck

muscles spasmed and the doc- ,

tor had to pull it out with a pair
of plyers. And of course they

were rusty. It is not’ uncommon
practice for rue-n to play with
broken arms and wrists.

—That racism is rampant in
the sport. Black players are seg-
regated on the St. Louis Car-
dinels, sitting in separate sec-
tion to eat, sleeping in segre-
gated wings of training camp
dorms, not being able to drink
beer in the same bar with the
white players,- and being
prevented from playing posi-

tions thatfrequire intelligence.”

—That college football players
at Syracuse and other colleges
are payed for their activity, some-
times as much as fifty dollars a
week.

~—-That football is a brutal sport,
the players being‘,-intimidated
into virility proving contests,
playing with injuries, and rou-
tinely trying to knock the living
hell out of each other f'or the

   
   
    
   
 

pleasure of the coaches. At the S
same" time the Cardinel staff A r
insists that their men be in bed

Meggysey’s close involvement . L
with the sport prevents ‘the easy.
dismissal of these charges. As a
player he had the opportunity -
to observe ..first hand the things A

Fourth In A Series

by MARK COHEN
North Vietnam protested the slaught-

 er and repression in the South under

Diem to the International Control Com-
_mission but Ho’s government didnot di-

‘I ~ rectly interfere. But in the South, for

the ex-Viet Minh cadres, the situation
was far more serious. They felt betray-
ed by the Geneva conference which

I promised elections in 1956 and felt aban-

doned by their northern comrades.

.In March, 1960, some of these ex-
resistance fighters gathered in eastern

Cochin China and issued a “general
“ call” for the creation of a front to deal

with the repression in the South. They

“gcalled for a nationwide uprising against

the Saigon regime. Thus, the National

if  .  Liberation Front (NLF) was formed.

Dean Rusk, Secretary of State under

it ‘the Kennedy and Johnson administra-

tion, stated that the NLF “has no signi-
ficant popular following. . It relies
heavily on terror.” Indeed,_ Diem's ap-

rpointed village chiefs were murdered,

his police informers driven out, land-
lords fled to the safety of the cities, gov-
ernment officials either joined. the
NLF, served with their tacit approval or

. lost their lives.

The NLF employed terror tactics,

“specifically against those whom the peas-
. ants feared. Orders from Saigon were

‘ignored, feedback ceased to exist in
whole areas of the countryside-the gov-
ernment came to see it ruled in a
void. All, claimed the government, due
to simple terrorism. Yet the peasants
saw this quite differently, As a South

.1-Vietnamese peasant told Jacques Doyan
, an independent French, reporter who

traveled in NLF territory in 1968,

“(The NLF soldiers) are very nice
to us, very polite. They don’t take any-
thing in our homes or anywhere else
in the village. . . If they want some-
thing, they ask for it, and if they can,

by GEORGE PUTNAM

.“,,The biggest mistake the West has
made has been to allow itself to drift
into a state of mental stagnation, apathy,
and inaction—that we have been para-
lyzed by a new kind of strange thinking——
that we have been thinking the way the
Communists want us to think—and that
this has softened America for a proposed
Communist takeover.”

, Now it is this reporter's opinion that
any thoughtful American must be out
of his cotton pickin’ mind if he doesn’t
now realize that the violence within
America—these political kidnapings

W " abroad—the assassinations—-the bombings-

the rioting and more—that all this is Com-
munist inspired.

Now over the past thirty years, this
reporter, and others, first warned Amer-

they pay for it. Even the rice. . . not
like the governments soldiers who help
themselves, taking the animals and the
fruits, pillaging when they’re on an
operation in the village.“

By 1961 (one year after its founding)
NLF had extended its control in vary-
ing degrees to 80 percent of the coun-
tryside according to an U.S. administra-
tion advisor. This reflected the reality
that by 1963 while Diem’s regime re-
tained its bureaucracy, police, and a
powerful army, it controlled little more
than the cities of Vietnam.

In the countryside the NLF was
carrying out sweeping programs of
economic and social reform. As USIA
official, Douglas Pike, stated, “the
land distribution system was pressed
until, by the end of 1964, The DRV
(North Vietnam) could claim that the
peasants in the areas under NLF con-
trol have become masters of more than
1.3 million hectares (3.2 million acres)
of South. Vietnam’s total 3.5 million
hectares (8.6 million acres) of cultivated
land.

The NLF draws strong support from
Vietnamese women who were without
rights and regarded as private property
by the French. To combat this, in March
1961, a Women’s Liberation Associa-
tion was formed in the liberated zones

which has brought women into being“

a strong force in all aspects of society
including a fighting role in the NLF.

Against this background, in May.
1963, government troops in the old
imperial capital of Hue shot into a
crowd of unarmed Buddhists killing
nine. Large scale protest ensued in
South Vietnam with international audi-
ences being shocked as several monks
burned themselves to death. The pro-
test turned to riots and the U.S. decided
Diem’s time had come. On November 1

ica against Hitler and the Na2is—and
then against the Communists.

In 1953, the Red leaders set up a
timetable of conquest for the entire
world. Total conquest was to be com-
pleted by 1973. And that table of con-
quest—that Communist Mein Kampf,
captured by American military intelli-
gence at the close of the Korean War,
was placed in the Congressional Record
April 29, 1954, on page 5708.

Now the Communist plan was, and
is,‘ to take Asia—then Africa——next Europe
and finally, America. That time-table
is much too lengthy to quote in its
entirety. But here are selected state-
ments and some comments that indicate
the progress the Communists are mak-
ing in their plans to take over the
world.‘

a military coup detat with U.S. support
ended Diem's nine year rule.

What followed was a series of coups
and counter-coups. The successors to
Diem, General Minh, Dom, and Dinh
were followed by General Kahn, Prem-

   

This is based mainly on Cleon Skou-
sen’s book, The Naked Communist. Now
here are those quotes and here are the
comments. The quotes are from the
Communist plan. The comments from
Skousen and from me.

COMMUNISM IN THE NUDE II

Quote—“We have to, until we are
certain of victory, take a course which
will not lead to war.” '

Comment—Official Communist stra-
tegy is to press for advantages on all
fronts, but to back down in the face
of major military resistance.

Quote—“Britain__must be placated by
being convinced the Communists and

the capitalist countries can live int

peacef‘

Comment—Peaceful coexistence was
not only sold to the people of Britain,
but to America as well. Coexistence
means to accept Communism as a per-
manent fixture on this earth. In other
words, a non-resistence to Communism.

Quote—“The United States must be
isolated by all possible means."

Comment—The progress of the Com-
munists should be obvious to' every-
body, what with Red expansion in
Asia, in Africa, Cuba, Central Ameri-
ca, South America, and now Canada to
the north, with its recognition of Red
China.

Quote—“To prevent the United States
from starting the war, depends upon
isolating the United States and an ef-
fective peace offensive.”

Comment—Peace is used as a means
of paralyzing U.S. resistance, and this
is to lead to peaceful surrender.

Quote—“Peaceful means should be
adopted in the case of India. And after
India has been won over. the problems
of the Philippines and Arabic nations
can be solved by economic coopera-
tion."

Comment-—Red subversion is clearly
apparent in the Philippines—it is shock-
ingly obvious in the Arab states.

Quote—“A wave of revolution sweeps
the whole continent of Africa. And the

.ll.S. Reliance On Militaryfor Vietnam Government Control 

iers Ngugen Xuan Oanh and,Tran Van
Houng and then by Dr. Phan Huy
Quat. The U.S. refused to support any
group which favored an end to the
war thus relying totally on the mili-
tary for government control.

imperialists—that’s us--will be driven
into the sea.”

Comment-—This should be so obvious
as to require no comment.

Quote—“With Asia and Africa dis-
connected from the capitalist coun-
tries in Europe, there will be total eco-
nomic collapse in western Europe and
capitulation will be just a matter of

3

course.’ \

Comment—Trade relations with
Africa are disrupted. The noose is draw-
ing tighter. West Germany is rushing,
as you see, to sign agreements with the
Kremlin.

Quote—~“As for the United States,
crushing economic collapse and)indus-
trial breakdown will follow the Euro-
pean crisis. ”

Comment—The plunging of the Unit-
ed States into a paralyzing depression-
depression—is part of the last stage of the
Soviet plan for the conquest of America.

Quote—“Canada and South America
will find themselves in the same hope-
less and defenseless condition.” .

Comment——If the United
should become totally isolated, intimi-
dated and subverted, then the whole
western hemisphere would fall.

And finally, this quote from the
Communists——this plan—“Twenty years
from now”—that would be 1953, talking
about 1923 projection—“world revolu-
tion will be an accomplished fact”-
in the year 1973.

Comment-looking at the overall
picture, the Communist timetable of
conquest is alarmingly close to being
right on schedule.

Cleon Skousen—-the author of The
Naked Communist-an expert on Com-
munist strategy—points out that this en-
tire plan would collapse if only the West.
would awaken——would take the initiative
to start pushing Communism back on
all fronts.

It is this reporter's opinion that if
we do not——that our
will. as Nikita Krushchev predicted-
live under Communism.

Donatelli Not Giving
A Damn For People

Editor. Pitt News:

So Donatelli thinks the private
sector of education should be re-
vitalized. Then why doesn't he
go to CMU or Duquesne him-
self? Why is he at Pitt, being
subsidized by the state and con-
tributing to that growing gov-
ernment influence in education
that he detests so much?

Could it be he is in the same
situation as so many others who
can’t afford to go somewhere
else: that were Pitt not subsi-
dized they would be unable to
gain an education at all?

As for opening minds and see-
ing beyond the liberals “little
enclave," perhaps Donatella
should pull his own head out of
his racist, 18th Century-conserva-
tive ass and explore the real
world.

What other “vital projects"
would universal education elim-
inate—Vietnam, ABM, SST? If
so, then for humanity’s sake let‘s
spend all our money on educa-
tion.

should realize that

Donatelli

education is also the base upon
which all the “infinite number
of things“ society would like
to do are built.

On Mr. Donatelli's loan pro-
gram. First. let's face it that the
government will be supplying

 

Unfortunate borrowers find them-
selves repaying this loan for
years. In a vicious circle. we
find their offspring also borrow-
ing because the parents are still
struggling to repay their loans.

Why not initially educate some

this money and controlling the
lives of the unfortunate borrow-
ers. Now try to rationalize to a
person that he should burden
himself with a $20,000 education-
al debt only to enter a job-mar-
ket where unskilled or uneducat-
ed persons will make as much.

persons free so that they may be-
gin a career debt-free and afford
the costs of their offsprings‘ edu-

cation? Then Donatelli, except
for the initial thrust, we get gov-
ernment out of education alto-
tether.

io:2opm-ézooom

s

Nowhere does Donatelli refer
to the social good accruing from
an educated citizenry: not only
in technological advantages but
in human and social terms as
well. Of course. Donatelli is
an entrepreneur interested only
in ripping off as many persons
as possible for his profit. He
p0esn‘t seem to give a damn
about the people.

In setting up my own plan to
finance higher education, I al-
most agree with Mr. Donatelli.
I also believe the state should
not grant subsidies only to cer-
tain universities. In fact, I don’t
think the state should appropri-
ate money to any college. By
so doing, the state influences
or possible controls in extreme
cases the decision of the indi-
vidual in choosing a college by
making some institutions relative-
ly cheaper than others.

To ensure maximum freedom
of choice and to guarantee the
highest quality of education, the
state should simply pay the tui-
tion and living expenses of each
of its citizens at any college or
university they choose to attend.
irregardless of the costs or loca-
tion of that institution.

prevents man from reaching the heights.
The movie has no center. There is in
the mind of the screenwriter some paral-
lel between birds and man but what-
ever it is will remain his secret.

The subplot, a spoof of Bullitt does
not entirely come off either. Crack
San Francisco detective Frank Shaft is
imported by an ambitious politician to
solve the murders. Shaft, learning that
all of the victims were covered with
bird droppings, takes a sample from a
handy corpse and says solemnly, “I want
to know what kind of bird this came
from.” Pretty funny as are Shaft’s gim-
let blue eyes. But that is about it.

in the stuff it throws away, the little

Altman may also be the first Ameri-
can director since Welles and Sturges
to use a permanent cast of fine char-
acter actors. Half of the cast’ is from

“M*A*S*h”. Maybe next time out Altman,

will provide them with better material.

The whole in this case is not equal

McCloud does in his attempt to defy

aster in the end.

Football

(Continued from Page 3)

The book is a rambling, unor-
ganized narrative on the making
of a football player. Meggysey
has done the typical football
thing, high school honors, col-
lege stardome, then professional
drudgery. In high school and
college he played the game
with athletic fanatism. At the
same_ time he questioned the
motivation of the sport, the mal-
treatment of the players.

If Meggysey’s contention that
football is a microcsm of Ameri-
can ideals, then what the Mon-
day night games on ABC rep-
resent is a weekly performed ori-
ginal drama on American life.
Of course it’s in living color and
presented from all points of view.
Perhaps this should be a drama
review.

So in order to prevent supper
athletes from breaking records
that they can‘t humanly break
and to keep the game from get-
ting so boring that people might
switch to the Beverly Hillbillys
they ought to change football to
the old game of the Jim Thorpes

, and Knuit Rocknes.

Despite the noticeable lack of

Associate Sports Editor

 
 
 

early 60’s has Pitt Panther basketball
gained as much notoriety as it has in this 1970-71 season.
In three years at the University, Coach Charles ‘Buzz’ Ridl
has molded a squad that rivals Duquesne as the top basket-
ball team in the city. ‘

Certainly, the‘. Panthers haven't arrived yet, but they’re
well on their way. The amazing evolution from a 4-20 sea-
son in 1968-69, through a 12-12 campaign last year, to a 11-7

-card after three-quarters of the present season is enough to ’

indicate that Pitt basketball is progressing steadily.

“I’ve been very pleased with us,” said the ex—Westminster
mentor, Ridl, as he commented on the Cagers’ year to date.
“We were hoping for a few upsets and we got them.”

The upsets have kept people talking about the Panthers.
Starting in December with the Steel Bowl at the Civic Arena,
Pitt established itself as a team to be reckoned with. By

6 knocking off Duquesne and then holdingtheigr own until half-
way through the second period_ with UCLA, Pitt set the pace

for the season.

..The Players never doubted their ability to beat Duquesne
and proved that their confidence was well-founded. Many of
the Panthers had played against members of the Duke squad

in summer leagues around the city. They looked past Du-

quesne to UCLA, who they battled all the way.

Then Pitt beat Davidson, and North'Carolina State came
into town a week later. According to a local reporter from
the Durham Sun a newspaper that serves much of the North
Carolina area, people in the South regarded the Pitt thrashing
of Davidson as significant and began to look toward the
Panther squad with more respect. The two previous upsets
proved not to be flukes as Pitt turned back the Wolfpack,
89-75. I

Now the Panthers stand at 11-7 with six games remaining.
The rough part of the schedule appears to be over, but not
according to Ridl.

“These games that We’re going to play are going to be
tough,” said Ridl. “There’s no doubt about it. We’re con-
tinuing to play good basketball, and we’ll have to prepare
very seriously for Penn State, West Virginia and Georgia
Tech.” 7

Penn State, who has been playing improved basketball,
jacking their record up to .500, has just come off tough loses
to Temple by three points and Syracuse (68-64). PSU has
a reputation for being very tough at home where the Panther-
Lion contest takes place February 27.

West Virginia has already beaten Pitt once this year in
what the Pittsburgh Press termed a ‘garbage disposal’ game
and is also tough in their own home territory.

  

before the Pitt wrestler gained
complete control

The Pitt grapplers proceeded
to win the next four bouts with
little effort. Jim Fleming record-
ed the only fall of the meet
in the 167-pound weight class
with a third period cradle. 177
pounder Wally Morrell upped
his spotless slate to 3-0 with a
workmanlike 10-5 triumph over
Mountaineer Steve Orlosky. As
in his two previous matches, Mor-
rell gave his opponent a lesson
in takedowns.

Snakebitten by the injury jinx
all year, the Panthers were not
about to escape unscathed last

‘night. After sitting out the last

two matches because of the flu,
190 pounder Dave Young appear-
ed to have fully recovered when
he pulled his left groin muscle
at the beginning of the second
period and was forced to default
the bout to his West Virginia

, foe.

Mountaineer coach George Ne-
deff was pleased with his squad’s
overall performance. He con-
ceded his wrestlers’ inexperience,
but added that the defeat would
probably help his matmen in
their last two meets of the season
next week.

Although Pitt coach Dave
Adams was proud of his team’s ex-
hibition, he was ' disgusted at the
apathy of the Pitt student body.

“Our wrestlers are doing one
heck of a job out there on the
mat,” remarked Adams.

1 Test Against Leopards 

by MARTY HELLMAN

‘After a week’s layoff, the Panther basketball team returns to
action tonight at 8 p.m. against the Lafayette College Leopards at

the Field House.

It will be the next-to-the-last home game of the season; and the
start of the windup of the campaign which includes five more con-

tests.

A win would insure the Panthers and ‘Coach Buzz Bidl their

second consecutive .500 or
better season as their record
is presently 11-7. _

The Leopards, boasting Tracy
Tripucka, the nation’s twelfth
leading scorer, present an ob-
stacle to the Panthers. Currently,
their record is 14-6, and they
are atop the standings in the
Middle Atlantic Conference-
West Division with a 6-1 mark.

Tripucka, averaging’27.1

points per game, is shooting 55 .

Walt Kocubinski, a 6-5 sopho-
more, is averaging 16 points and
10 “rebounds a game, while co-
captain Jay Mottala, a 6-2
junior guard, is hitting over 12
points a contest. *1 -

The Leopards leading rebound-
er is senior co-captain Ron'Moy-

lost pretty badly. They still have that guy (Rich) Yunkus
though, and he’s really good.

“We were looking for .500 when the season started, and
we have a chance. Now we just have to stay in there and
play good ball.”

The season has gone well and over-all Ridl is pleased
with its progress.'He cites the sophomores as a big reason
for the success of the campaign. And he is striving to “keep
up enthusiasm and momentum” as the season reaches the
home stretch.

“We kept reaching for strengths," concluded Ridl. “We
tried to use the right ballplayers at the right time. Sometimes
we were wrong, but it's easy to second-guess yourself after
a games over.”

It’ll be interesting to see if the momentum can pro-
duce a spectacular finish that propels the Panthers beyond
their regular 24 game schedule.

three years.

Ironically, the man who holds
the mark is Harry Lundy, a
Pittsburgh resident, who ex-
pects to be on hand to see his
11 year mark shattered.

Included in the Leopard’s
14 victories are wins over Gettys-
burg and Bucknell, opponents
of the Panthers earlier this sea-
son. Two of their losses were
at the hands of two Pitt con-
querers, Fordham and Syracuse.

“They like to put it up a lot,
and their offense is similar to a

stated.

As for defensing Tripucka.
Ridl realizes the importance of
keeping his output to a mini-
mum.

“We’re working on a defense.
but it will be hard to keep him
from scoring," he commented.
“But we‘ll have to try and hold
him down.”

the Leopards to be tough on

Undefeated? Playboys
Slip Past Stitherlariti

by MIKE ZONIS »

In a game that went right down to the wire, the undefeated
Playboys eeked out another victory over the once beaten Sutherland
House in Intramural basketball play. The final score was 44-42.

Sutherland House, after losing their first game of the season to

Keystone, came on strong to win five straight games. The Playboys
had turned in tough performances in all of their games, winning

six straight.

On Monday night at Trees
Hall Gym, these two powers
Throughout the
first half, the game remained
close with the lead changing
numerous times. Gary Rappse
of theiPlayboys and Andy Phil-
lips of Sutherland House both
had totals of ten points in the
first period. John Barry pulled
down numerous rebounds for
the Playboys. At the halftime
buzzer, the Playboys led, 27-23.

The action-packed second half
began with Sutherland ‘hooper
Doug Gindin stealing the ball
and going in for a score. Again,
as in the first half, the lead
changed hands many times.

Gindin, after being shut out the_

entire preceding period tallied
ten key points in the second
half. With eight minutes left in
the game, the Playboys led by
a narrow, 38-37. E

In the next six minutes, the
action slowed down consider-
ably. Both. defenses proved
their worth, while only six points
were scored by the two teams
combined. With two minutes
left the Playboys held at 42-39.

With nine seconds remaining
in the game, An‘dy Phillips re-
bounded a missed foul shot and
put the ball in the hoop, tying
the game at 42-42. At’ this point
the Playboys called for a time
out.

When they brought the ball
in bounds, Dave Rugh dr_ibbled
downcourt and tried a 20-foot

shot. The ball went off the side ,

Dick Bradshaw won his first
swimming match as acting head
coach last night by defeating
Grove City, 59-53 at Trees Pool,
but the taste of fictory wasn‘t
sweet. ‘

Bradshaw predicted before the
meet that it would be close, a
third place here or todre being
the difference. The aura of the
competition known by both

teams before the meet placed a .

lot of pressure on the teams. At
the start of the meet things be-
gan to turn sour.

Grove City won the 400 yard
medley event as Bradshaw ex-
pected, but the margin of vic-
tory was quite small.

Mark Cohen, swimming as

he never has before this season,
made up a two body length lead
on the Grove City swimmer
before fading to second by a
head.

In the next event, the 1,000
yard freestyle, Fred Lewis won
going away by eleven seconds.

Second place would have been
awarded to Grove City‘s Russ
Rosenbauer but for the fact
that he was disqualified for not
touching the wall after the
twelfth length.

Pitt’s Howell,
third, was
second place.

Instead of being behind by a
score of 10-6, Pitt was tied with
Grove City, 8-8. E

“What can I say? I just didn’t expect any of this at all,” re-
lated Sandra Bullman, Pitt’s women’s varsity basketball coach.

What Coach Bullman didn’t expect was the shattering defeat

she said.

From the outset of the game,
Pitt dominated the boards. The
women cagers held C—MU to
only 10, points in the first half
while they racked up 47.

Pitt’s co-captain, Phyllis Woj-
ciechowski, was high scorer
with 28 points. “Everyone was
really on tonight,” stated Phyl.
“Just everyone was hitting.”

Other top
were Rose

scorers for Pitt
Smith with 16
points, Tana Casciola and
Cathy Cassell, both with 10,
and co-captain Elaine Kingas

- with 6.

Carnegie-Mellon’s starters,
Paula Veigith, Andie Mintz,

Ruthie Portzo, Sam Mryczko and '

Cathy DuBreiut, played the
majority of the game. C’MU’s
high scorer, Andie Mintz, com-
piled 16 points, over half of

» C—MU’s total points.

Pitt, however, did not.-.‘stick
with its starting line-up. For the
second time in a row, the bench
was cleared. “Roni Fensterman
and Mina Altshuler die fantas-
tic,” said Coach Bullman. “Roni
is giving a tough fight for a
place in the first five. And Mina
had some good layups tonight.

According to Yeats At The

iHawk’s Well is a fable to ex-

A‘

  

 



“press the idea that “all man‘s

days are a preparation for what
never comes.” A well, the water
of which appears at certain tim-
es is guarded by the Hawk, has
. the ability to grant immortality
‘to anyone who drinks from it.
The trick is to be there when it
bubbles up.

An'Old Man who has attempt-
ed to drink from the well for fif-
ty years represents emptyness
and the futility of trying. The

 young man, passion and the con-

tinuing of the search. Both fail
to’ get to it and in the final
lines the chorus pronounces the
verdict: “Accurst the life of man

Between passion and emptiness
what he longs for never comes.”

Marilyn Plotkins who played
the Hawk, William Grgurich, the
old man, and Edwin Rupert, the
young man, and chorus, seems
unified on their interpretation of
the play and execute the dance
movements with confidence al-
though the meter and poetic
quality of the lines seem lost
at times. Audience reaction to
At The Hawks Well was in some
sense similar to that of Ondine
and The Leader: that something
important and interesting reason
we are being left out of it. Per-
haps a more detailed printed
program?

WOMEN

Through the joint effort of the Office of the Provost and the
Chancellor's Advisory Council On Women's Opportunities,
questionnaires have been designed to elicit the opinions of
women students, staff, and faculty on their perceptions re-
garding their status as women at the University. Since this
is the first comprehensive attempt to employ women's opin-
ions in the formulation of policy directly affecting them as
a group, it is essential that all women complete ‘the ques-
tionnaires, which they will soon receive in the mail. Com-
pleted questionnaires should be returned as quickly as pos-
sible to the Provost's Office, except in the case of dorm stu-
dents who should return them to their R.A.’s. NOTE: English
department faculty, and students majoring in English should
note that the check list accompanying the questionnaires
omits their department in the code listings. Those persons
should write ”English" where appropriate.

Typing: Theses, papers, etc. also
equations and tables, keep this
