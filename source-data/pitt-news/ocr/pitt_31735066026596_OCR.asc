Delta pressured
her to drink

Hal Turner
Edltor In Chlef

An 18-year-old woman
yesterday accused Pitt’s Tri-
Delta sorority of pressuring her
to drink as part of an annual
party ritual in February while
she was a pledge.

Angela Regal, who just
ﬁnished her freshman year at
Pitt, said she and four other
pledges were required to drink
liquor and beer at the ﬁrst
“mixer” they attended after
accepting invitations to join
Tri—Delta. A mixer is a party
that a sorority and fratemity
throw together in the fraternity
house. ‘

“One girl admitted to
never having had a shot of
liquor, and she didn’t want to
do it,” Regal said. “But it was
like ‘too bad, you have to do
1t.’’’ .

Tri-Delta President Katie
Carney said no pledges are
forced to drink alcohol at any
functions.

“If she’s over 18, she’s an
adult and she can make her
own decisions,” she said.

Vice President of Finance
Heather Thomaselli said no
underage drinking occurred at
the fraternity house that night.
Carney and Thomaselli
refused to reveal the name of
the fraternity and Regal said
she could not remember it.

“If they are not 21, then
they do not drink,” Thomaselli
said and Carney reiterated.

Regal maintains that alco-
hol was available to her and the
four other underage Tri-Delta
pledges.

“No, they’re lying; this is
just a total bald-faced lie,” she
said “Of course they’re going
to say there was no [underage]
drinking because they don’t
want their precious images to
be tarnished,” she continued

The armual “Kissing

Carnations” ritual between Tri-
Delta and the
involved the members of each
organization lining up and fac-
ing each other, according to
Regal. The man gave the
woman opposite him a carna-
tion in return for a kiss, ﬂien
they each drank a shot of
Schnapps, she said.

Later at the mixer, the
pledges and sorority sisters
sang a song called “Chug a
Beer,” according to Regal.
Afterward, a sister told the
pledges to chug their beers
along with her, and not to stop
unless she did ﬁrst, Regal said.

Regal claims she drank
ﬁve shots of liquor, around 40
ounces of grain alcohol punch,
and six 12-ounce beers, though
she did not feel pressured to
drink all of it, she added

“I felt pressured to drink a
shot of liquor during ‘Kissing
Carnations’ and after ‘Chug a
Beer,”’ Regal said.

Tri-Delta sisters taught the
women two drinking songs the
night they became ofﬁcial
pledges, on “Bid Night,”
according to Regal: “Chug a
Beer” and “Old Delta Tri.” At
least three songs about Tri-
Delta pride were taught, but
Regal said she couldn’t
remember them.

Part of “Old Delta Tri,”
according to Regal, is as fol-
lows: “For it’s guzzle, guzzle
guzzle, as the beer goes down
the muzzle, drink! Deltas
never rim dry! More beer! For
it’s more, more, more ‘til the
cops beat down the door, in the
cellars of Old Delta Tri.”

“It’s horrible that a
University-afﬁliated group
taught that to 18- and 19-year-
old girls,” Regal said

Thomaselli said she’s
heard of “Chug a Beer,” but
not “Old Delta Tri,” and that
no drinking songs were taught

A Pitt student and his friend
denounced campus and Oakland
safety after two armed men mugged
and threatened to kill them at the
corner of Bates Street and Oakland
Avenue early Friday morning.

Inlightofwhatheseesasalack
of police protection, one of the vic-
tims said he would buy a gun to
“provide some for myse .”

The thieves escaped with
approximately $10 — $15, and credit
cards from both Todd Barton, 25, a
Pitt biology major, and his friend

Brad Crocow, 25, who recently
moved to Pittsburgh from
Columbus, Ohio.

Barton said the muggers threat-
ened to kill him and Crocow if they
did not quickly surrender their wal-
lets.

“They just kept shouting,
‘Hurry up, hurry up!’” he said

According to Barton, one of the
muggers was holding a long—barrel
.22-caliber serni-automatic pistol.

Barton, who said he was the
victim of an attempted car-jacking
two years ago near the Oakland exit
oﬁ the Parkway East, said he usual-
ly carries a gun. He owns .40-caliber

He did not have a weapon with
him at the time of the robbery.

“The whole thing happened so
fast,” Barton said “I wouldn’t have
had time to shoot. They probably
would have had time to shoot ﬁrst.”

Crocow said he is glad Barton
didn’t have a gun because he feels

Staff Wrlter

A former Pitt student, almost
expelled last semester for violating
University computer policy, says
he doesn’t need a college degree to
succeed and has since dropped out
of Pitt to begin his own business.

John Vranesevich completed
his freshman year this spring and
decided to leave Pitt after a dispute
with the University over his web-
site AntiOnline.

“I’m in a better position now

than if I were a college graduate,”
Vranesevich said. “I’m 19 and I’m
going to have my own business.”

He received a call from a cor-
poration who heard about him and
the dispute on CNN.

Dave Catan, CEO of Pat
Catan’s, a national chain of craft
stores and restaurants, told

Vranesevich he wanted to provide
ﬁnancial backing for his website as
a silent partner.

Catan provided Vranesevich
with $500,000 to take his company
to a corporate level.

AntiOnline, run by
Vranesevich and his ﬁiend, Steve
Malone, provides information to
the general public about how to
protect a computer system from
hackers. It also gives information
about the different methods hack-
ers use to break into computer sys-
tems and posts news about com-

puter security.

. Vranesevich created
AntiOnline during his sophomore
year in high school.

Copy
copies itself

A new Copy Cat targeted to serve
the upper campus was opened on the
second ﬂoor of Scaife Hall, a few feet
from Falk library.

The new store had its test run
opening on April 20 and held its official
grand opening on May 8. Invitations
were sent out to specific individuals for
a “closed door open house.” During the
grand opening, prizes were given away
including several Cathedral mouse
pads.

Vending machines and study tables
had occupied the space the Scaife Copy
Cat now uses. Prior to the opening of
this Copy Cat, a copy center had been
located on the same ﬂoor, almost direct-
ly across the hall from the location of
the new Copy Cat.

With the opening of the Scaife
Copy Cat, the copy center was closed
and its services are being provided by
the new Copy Cat.

According to Sam Rizzardo, man-
agcr of the new Copy Cat, the differ-
ence between a copy center and a Copy
Cat is that it offers more services for
students.

Instead of going down the hill to
buy course packets, notecards or a pen,
students can simply walk the few feet
separating Falk Library and Copy Cat.
The Scaife Copy Cat is stocked with the
same supplies and sundries as the
Forbes Copy Cat.

The majority of business that Copy
Cat receives is departmental requisi-

tions. Rizzardo predicted that more stu-
dents will be using the Scaife Copy Cat
once they are back in school. Unlike the
Forbes Copy Cat, which is open 16
hours a day on weekdays and 16.5 hours
on weekends, the Scaife Copy Cat is
only open Monday through Friday from
7 a.m. to 7 p.m.

She also worked as a diplomatic

deputy foreign editor, assistant news editor
and senior editor in charge of the paper’s
news operations on weekends.

Before joining the New York Times,
Crossette was a journalist at the Birmingham

She has made numerous appearances
on radio and television programs to share her

to pledges on bid night.

While Regal pledged, a Tri-Delta sister
named Jamie Beckwith was the “new
member educator.” It was not her responsi-
bility at parties to make sure underage
pledges stayed sober, she said. Beckwith,
Carney and Thomaselli all refused to name
the person who is supposed to monitor
underage drinking at their parties.

“I don’t think I’m in a position to
release that information,” Thomaselli said,
but would not elaborate.

Pitt’s advisor to Greek organizations,
Kerry Daley, said these accusations are
unfortunate because Tri-Delta is such an
outstanding organization. ’

“Tri-Delta has a history of being so fan-
tastic at Pitt. They are the cream of the
crop,” she said Tri-Delta is the school’s top
money-raising sorority, many members are
part of student government, and the group’s
grades are better than most Pitt sororities,
Daley added. ,

‘‘They’re just really are terriﬁc
women,” she said

She said she didn’t know much about
Regal’s accusations and had been out of
town for two weeks. Daley said she could-
n’t comment much Tuesday, but she is
meeting today with Carney, Pahnellenic
Association President Melissa Chordock
and Joe Cavalla from Student Activities.

She urged students to report problems
like this to the authorities, who will investi-

FROM PAGE 1

gate the allegations.

“If anyone was hazed or pressured to
drink, they need to ﬁle charges,” Daley said.

Regal is not pressing charges for haz-
ing, but said the sorority sisters should have
shown more concern for the pledge who
testiﬁed in court that she got drunk at a Tri-
Delta party then was sexually assaulted in
her date’s dorm room.

“Had Tri-Delta been mature enough to
take some of the blame for what happened,
I probably wouldn’t have come forward,”
Regal said “But because they refuse to
accept any responsibility, I feel they need to
be exposed for what they are.”

Regal added that as a rape victim she
understands the assailant is always at fault
in sexual assault, but that allowing the
alleged victim to drink put her in a vulnera-
ble situation with a man .she’d met that
night.

“I ﬁnd it ironic that even though we’re
warned not to go back to boys’ rooms by

ourselves, her “sisters” allowed her to leave '

with a boy when she was drunk,” Regal
said. A rule sheet which Tri-Delta publishes
mentions this warning, according to Regal.

The sorority?s drinking tendencies are
why Regal choose to stop pledging the day
after the mixer, she said. Her boyﬁiend,
Dean Gallitsis, had to help her walk when
she returned to her dormitory, according to
Regal. _

“I looked at myself in the mirror once I
had sobered up and realized that continuing
to pledge would end in me becoming a
drunken ‘sorostitute,”’ Regal said.

When he came to Pitt in 1997, he set

up AntiOnline on his computer in his ’

Tower C room.
The dispute between Vranesevich and

the University began when Pitt’s

Computing and Information Services
(CIS) shut down his and two other stu-
dents’ ethemet accounts.

The University claimed that
AntiOnline was an inappropriate use of
networking resources, and slowed down
Pitt’s computer system because it received
too many visitors each day.

Vranesevich said the University never
explained what it meant by inappropriate
use of networking resources.

“They pointed to several statutes with-
out explaining how they applied to us,” he
said. '

Vranesevich‘ said he doesn’t under-
stand why Pitt claimed AntiOnline slowed
down University computers.

“It didn’t slow down my desktop com-
puter so I have doubts about how it slowed
down the entire Pitt network,” Vranesevich
said. —

He said he also doesn’t understand
why the University terminated his Internet
connection without first asking him to limit
the number of visitors to AntiOnline.

Vranesevich said he left the University
because he felt opportunities in his com-
puter science major would no longer be
open to him.

He said he realized this when he
applied for a position as a residential net-
working (ResNet) consultant, but didn’t
get to the‘ second phase of the application
process. Vranesevich said he received two
e—mails from Lee Bannister, the coordina-
tor of ResNet. The ﬁrst was a form e-mail
telling him CIS would not interview him in
the second phase of the hiring process.

He then sent a reply to Bannister, ask-
ing him what his shortcomings were so he
could remedy them and apply again for a
ResNet position.

According to Vranesevich, Bannister
replied CIS didn’t feel it was appropriate
for him to have a position as a CIS staff
member because of the dispute between
Vranesevich and the University.

Bannister also wrote that he could not
see a job in CIS for Vranesevich in the
future, Vranesevich said.

Bannister, however, denied sending
Vranesevich the second e—mail. I

With his experience teaching comput-
er courses to teachers and students during
summer and after-school programs in his
high school, Vranesevich said he felt dis-
appointed he did not get a position with
CIS.

After these incidents, Vranesevich said
he felt it would be difﬁcult to be a comput-
er science major at Pitt.

“I don’t think not having a bachelor’s
degree will hold me back,” he said.
“[Running my own business] will replace a
bachelors, masters and, after a few years, a
Ph.D.” '

“If they [the police] aren’t going to pro-

he said

Crocow recently graduated from Ohio
State University in Columbus. He said he
lived in a neighborhood there where he felt
safe.

Pitt, he said, stands in stark contrast

“I wouldn’t send my kids down here,”
Crocow said I

Headdedthatfromnow onhewilltryto
avoid the Oakland area

Barton said he is dissatisﬁed with the
level of police protection around the Pitt carn-
pus.

“Ihere’s absolutely no order,” he said
“I’m going to complain to a lot of people
about this.”

Barton said The Original Hot Dog Shop,
where he and Crocow had been earlier in the
evening to buy a pizza, is heavily guarded by
bouncers and metal detectors. There are also
groups of police oﬂicers clustered around the
restaurant, he said, but very few oﬂicers on
any side streets.

“One block away you’re on your own,”
he said

Barton said something needs to be done

to improve the safety ofthe area.

‘This is our campus,” he said, “and we
have to tolerate this bullshit. Nobody does
anything about it because they’re afraid of
oﬁending somebody.”

Barton suggested installing surveillance
cameras so police would at least have a record
of violent incidents.

Barton said he and Crocow were walking
to Barton’s apartment on Semple Street
between 2 and 2:30 am.

According to Barton, a navy blue Lincoln
Continental with ﬁve men inside blasting rap
music slowly pulled past them as he and
Crocow walked along Oakland Avenue. The
car stopped and turned oif its lights. Barton
and Crocow were not able to get the license
plate number.

Barton said he was immediately nervous.

“I told my friend, if those doors open just-

start running,” he said.

Barton said after he and Crocow walked
past the Continental, it sped around the corner
at Bates Street and parked near Mad Mex.
When he and Crocow turned the corner, a
man wearing a hat and another in an orange
pull—over jumped out from behind a hedge
and demanded money and credit cards, he

said

“Obviously with a gun pointed at you,
you just give them the money,” Crocow said.
“It’s the sensible thing to do.”

After the robbery, the victims said they
hurried to Barton’s apartment where they
called 911. Pittsburgh police responded but
there were no Pitt police present, Barton said.

As long as they feel Oakland is danger-
ous, Barton and Crocow said they want other
people to understand the severity of the situa-
tion. «

“We shouldn’t have to put up with this
disorder on our campus,” Barton said.

“We need to get the word out,” Crocow
added

WEDNESDAY, _3 ]uNr: 1998

 Jupun,

India

Jason Gallinger
Assistant News Editor

For 33 years, local Japanese
have been talking about having
their own nationality room in the
Cathedral of Learning.

Their wait is over.

If all goes according to sched-
ule, the Cathedral will add two new
rooms —— the Indian room, due to
open in February, and the Japanese
roorrr, which will open next sum-
mer.

The Japanese room will fea-
ture a woven ceiling, ebony posts
to support the ceiling and a translu-
cent panel of rice paper on a wood-
en frame known as a shoji screen.

And it will be built in Japan.

Once the roorrr is ﬁnished, it
will be dismantled and shipped to
Pittsburgh. Artisans from Japan
will then use traditional tools and
methods to reassemble the room in
die Cathedral.

The rooms represent the next
phase of evolution for a Pittsburgh
landmark, the likes of which can-
not be found anywhere else in the
world. Some 35,0()0 tourists pay to
visit the nationality roorrrs each
year.

The Indian room is based on
the monastic University of
Nalanda in India, which dates to
the second century. Nalanda was
home to 10,000 monks who stud-

ied Buddhism, logic, grammar and
medicine. ,

Pittsburgh has the fourth high-
est Indian population of any
American city.

The central theme of the

Japanese notion of tokonoma:
space in a roonr that is decorative
and also has a sacred aura.

“The thing about Japan is that
it is so bare and elegant,” said
Maxine Bruhns, director of the

thing.”

While the design of the
Japanese room seeks to embrace
that ideal, Bruhns said, certain con-
cessions must be made. For
instance, classroom furniture will
be needed.

Since the Japanese room is set
to open later than the Indian room,
plans for the Japanese room have
not been completed, according to
Bruhns. She speculated the room
would ‘open sometime next surn-
mer and that it would be located in
either roorrr 316 or 317.

 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   

‘The Indian room, set to open
by February, will be large enough
to ﬁll two rooms, so the wall
between rooms 326 and 327 will
be knocked out.

Bruhns said the 400 pages of
plans for the Indian room are ready
to be sent to prospective contrac-
tors for bids. The contractor who

submits the lowest bid will auto-
matically be awarded the contract
to build the room, she said

According to Bruhns, the
Indian room carries a price tag of
$400,000 and the Japanese room
will likely cost around $350,000.

The most expensive nationali-
ty room ever was the German
roorrr, which cost $25,000 in 1938.

Japanese community mem-
bers have enlisted the help of sev-
eral American corporations to pay
for their room. Locally, USX, H.J.
Heinz and Sony have agreed to
contribute.

Members of the Indian room
community are financing their
room largely with their own
resources.

A celebration will commemo-
rate the completion of each room.
Dignitaries from the nations repre-
sented and Chancellor Mark
Nordenberg will deliver speeches.
There will also be dancing, music
and food

An integral element of each
ceremony will be the presentation
of the key to the new room.
Members of the committees who
designed ﬁre room will present the
key to the chancellor, who will
deliver a promise that the
University will perpetually main-
tain the room to museum stan-
dards.

The roorrrs —— the brainchild
of former chancellor John
Bowman, who also pioneered the
construction of the Cathedral itself
-— are internationally known.

The Dali Lama, Bruhns said,
once heard mention of Pitt and
remarked that the University has
those “wonderful rooms.”

The University will not hold
classes in the new rooms for one
year after completion, so students
and tourists can explore them with-
out distraction.

Tri—Delta: o sorority
locking in sisterhood

“Give a yell, give a cheer, for the girls who drink
the beer, in the cellars of Old Delta Tri.”

This catchy little verse, along with other swingin’
alcohol-soaked "tunes allegedly sung on Delta Delta 8
Delta’s bid night, goes against every excuse Tri—Delta
had to offer against the University’s decision to sus-
pend them.

No one is debating that a Tri—Delta pledge was
sexually assaulted after a party held on April 8, 1998 at ’
a downtown club. It’s a heinous felony for which the
man is at fault, but one that could possibly have been
prevented had Tri—Delta acted more responsibly. -

Perhaps someone should’ ve told Tri—Delta that
sorority means sisterhood, and that sisters look out for
each other. Whether drunk or sober, sisters are sup-
posed to keep an eye on each other at their parties so
incidents of this nature don’t occur.

Angela Regal, who depledged Tri—Delta in
February, said the sorority has a published rule that
states no member is allowed to leave a party with men
they don’t know. Not following this rule and having a
total disregard fortheir sister’s safety exacted horriﬁc
consequences on April 8.

Regal, who left because she did not want to
become a “sorostitute” and was worried by Tri-Delta’s
propensity to drink, said that Tri—Delta had not looked
out for their pledge at that particular party.

What is shocking is not the underage drinking, but
Tri-Delta’s encouraging pledges and failure to look out
for its members.

Tri—Delta apologists have claimed they did not see
the pledge who was allegedly assaulted drink the four p
shots of liquor and two pitchers of beer that she testi-
ﬁed in court to drinking. They went on to suggest that
she could’ve consumed them alone. That’s a slight
lapse in logic, considering most people don’t go to par-
ties to drink by themselves in a dark comer, especially
when they’re seeking the sisterhood of other party-
goers.

If it wasn’t for Tri-Delta’s creation of an atmos-
phere conducive to binge—drinking, this horriﬁc assault

' might not have happened.

As a result, this assault has been a black eye for
every Greek organization on campus. Instead of teach-
ing members to sing silly ditties dedicated to beer, per-
haps Tri—Delta should practice and preach responsibil-
lty.

 

Unlearned lessons wreak
disastrous consequences

Every year the solemn March of Life
makes its way from Auschwitz to the for-
mer location of the gas chambers at
Birkenau, in memory of the millions who
perishedatthehandsoftheNazis.This
year the march was led by Benjamin
Netanyahu, who took the opportunity to
informallpresentthat“Thisisthe lesson of
the Holocaust, this and only this: That the
existence of the Jewish people is tied to
Jewish sovereignty and a Jewish army that
rests on the strength of the Jewish fai ”

Really? 'I‘hat’s it? Doesn’t the lesson of
the Holocaust have at least something to do
with the dangers of national chauvinism
and racism —— and by extension their
metastases, imperialism and fascism? Far

be it from Bibi to suggest such a thing. The '

reallesson,hetells us,istheneedforamil-
itaristic and exclusivist state that is becom-
ing more and more openly theocratic (inci-
dentally, with this last development unfold-
ing to the growing consternation of Reform
and Conservative Jews within Israel itself).

For Netanyahu to draw

 

quislings. Indeed, Stem’s proposal refers to
“the goodwill of the German Reich gov-
ernment and its authorities toward Zionist
activity inside Germany and toward Zionist
emigration plans.”

All of this is a refutation, if any more
were needed, of the
ridiculous notion that opposition to Israeli
aggression is synonymous with anti-
Semitism. More importantly, it is a
reminder that at least one lesson of the
Holocaust is precisely the opposite of what
Netanyahu contends. It is. Nation-states
that base themselves on etlmic and reli-
gious exclusivism that are toying with a
dangerous principle that can have nothing
but disastrous consequences, not the least
of all for historically persecuted people like
the Jews.

In this case, though, the principle has
been most immediately disastrous for the
Palestinians, and Benjamin Netanyahu has
dedicated himselfto seeing that it stays that
way. In doing so, his government is resort-
ing to the cruder, more tradi-

broader lessons from the JQH N tional tactics of an occupation

would be ideologically disastrous, because
therearecertaindetailsofthepastthatthose
on the Israeli right would prefer not to
remember.

The ﬁrst detail that corrres to mind is
the well-documented connection between
the predecessors of the modern Likud party
and European fascism, all the way from the
Mussolini sympathizer Zev Jabotinsky of
theIrgunovertoLEHI, ledbyAvraham
Stern. In January of 1941, Stem wrote a
proposal that he sent with an emissary to
give to two of Hitler’s agents in Beirut The
proposal called for “The establishment of
the historical Jewish state on a national and
totalitarian  and bound by a treaty
with the Gennan Reich,” in return for
which the Stem Gang offered “to actively
take part in the war on Gerrnany’s si .”
'I‘he second in command of the Stern Gang,
and Stem’s successor as its leader, was
Yrtzhak Yezernitsky, now more familiarly
known as Yrtzhak Sharnir and the last
Likud Prime Minister before Netanyahu.

While this may seem almost unbeliev-
able, it should not be too surprising consid-
ering the obvious ideological compatibility
between Zionism and Nazism. Mass
Jewish emigration was, after all, remark-
ably conducive to the Nazi plans for “a
Jew-free Europe.” As Harmah Arendt
pointed out in “Eichmann in Jerusalem,”
when the Nazis sought collaborators
among the Jewish population, the Zionists
were always the ﬁrst to offer themselves as

indication enough of the failure of the so-
called “peace process.”

No matter how good it may look in
comparison, though, the previous Labor
party govemment was only marginally bet-
ter,ifthat. Sincehisassassinationbyaset-
tler fanatic, Yrtzhak Rabin — the butcher of
Ramleh and Lydda —- has been trans-
formed in the consciousness of most in the
U.S. into a “martyr for peace.” Historically,

though,theLaborpartyhashadaharderi

line on settlement policy than the Likud,
and Rabin’s government was no exception.
The Oslo agreement he sealed with the
“historic handshake” wiﬂi Arafat tumed
over a mere 3 percent (that’s right, 3 per-
cent) of the West Bank to Palestinian con-
trol. The aim was not to grant the
Palestinians self-determination but to create
bantustans controlled by local quislings, on
the model of apartheid South Aﬁica (a
regime that the Rabin government of the
1970s had wann relations, not insigniﬁ-
cantly).

Netanyahu has merely chosen to take
the more honest approach of naked domi-
nation. He is getting away with it, and will
continue to get away with it, until the world
—- and especially Israel’s main patron, the
United States -— takes the slogan “Never
Again” seriously, no matter who is respon-
sible for the crimes.

John lacny reminds you to resist the banal-
ity of evil.

WEDNESDAY, 3 [unit 1998

Kevin Carey

Columnist
Over the past week and a half, I

. have become aware of a situation that

— involves one of the sororities on campus.

I

The local media, also known as the finest
collection of cretins that God so blessed
with camera presence, have been consis-
tently reporting about a sexual assault
case that involves a young lady from the
Tri Delta sorority. After reading a few
articles concerning this case, including
recent unveiling, I became very upset to
discover that the presiding judge had
issued a number of quotes that seemed to
be totally inconsiderate to the feelings of
the young lady. I was left with one thing
to do —— write a letter to the judge and
voice my opinion, as inane as it may be.
Here it is:

Honorable Daniel Butler,

I am taking the time to construct a
letter that concerns the recent case that
you are presiding over. I feel obligated to
confront you on a few issues that in my

run.-nn News

  Uncleragestuclents drink: Ge! over ii!  

mind seem substantiated concerning this
case and the latest quotes that the media
has released at your credit. I wish to thank
you in advance for taking the time to con-
sider what I am about delve into.

First off, with due respect, I feel that
a swift kick to your chamber doors would
not be a bad way of capturing your atten-
tion long enough to let you in on a little
secret. On any campus of any major uni-
versity, underage drinking is a common
practice. I neither condone nor condemn
this, but it is a condition that has for some
reason or another become not only toler-
ated, but accepted as well.

I admire your efforts to address this
issue that so plagues our youth and eats at
the core of academia. However, I feel that
the manner in which you have chosen to
do so, by using the young lady involved
in a sexual assault case as an example,
leaves any person with a functioning
brain wondering if your black robe is
lying outside the boundaries of what
exactly is just and right.

Now, to face my own audacity, I
must defend why I feel this way.

It appears to me that you have lost

Assault, not

A comments published in The Pitt News about

Delta Delta Delta, showing that this univer-
sity continuously treats its Greek society like
the scum of the earth.

The only mistake in Tri—Delta’s recent
history is that they had an event oﬁ the Hill,
where laws cease to exist The only realiza-
tion I can draw is that the university is run by

 a bunch of hypocritical jackasses, who —— as
' long as the school doesn’t look bad — don’t
care what happens to its students.

In my opinion, Tri Delta did nothing
wrong. They rented out space at a local
restaurant and had a third-party vendor serve

 the alcohol, which is exactly what the rules
 tell Greeks they should do. There is no doubt
 in my mind that the owner of the bar knew
 ‘ minors were being served; he just wanted to
i make his money like every other bar in and

7 around Pittsburgh.

I have a few words for Judge Daniel

Butler. We are college students. We drink

underage, we smoke marijuana, we have
premarital sex, we speed on the parkway and
we stay up till 2 am. watching “Jerry
Springer.” Get over it How can a judge be so
blind as to say that underage drinking is
shocking? WAKE UP! If you want to be
shocked, come down to Market Square on
any given Friday where all my 20-year-old
friends and I will be drinking in public and
maybe even being rambunctious. Butler also
made a comment about what would have
happened if the students had been killed in a

decides to get rid of its Greeks (who are
within walking distance) students will be
forced to drive to the Southside.

case being centered on alcohol. No one
should even care. Underage drinking should
not be an-issue. The exact same thing could
have happened just as easily if the young
lady was 21. People should be concerned
about the real crime here - sexual assault -
and not about whether or not a teenager
should have been drinking.

If the‘ University cared more about its
students and less about its image, it wouldn’t
have any problems with retaining students.

sight of the fact that the case you are
overseeing involves an alleged sexual
assault, thus demonstrating to any dullard
that your grandiose idea of associating
drinking with rape is entirely empty, and
to me, unnerving as hell.

Perhaps the reason you have devel-
oped the issue of underage drinking into
such an integral element of this _case is
because you have an ax to grind, or per-
haps you have a separate agenda. After
all, you are a newly elected judge, and
prior to your latest press releases, your
name was nothing more than a title that
complemented a social security number.

For me to say this would not only
open a can of worms that I care not to see,
but it would also be just plain ridiculous.
Nearly as ridiculous as you saying, and I
quote, that the young lady “drank four
shots [of alcohol], and two pitchers of
beer.”

There is a quick question that I must
free my chest of — do you have any com-
prehension of the damage that amount of
alcohol would do to any average-sized
woman? Frankly, if that was the correct
amount of alcohol consumed by this

i 7

young lady, then I have great reservation
believing that: a) she would have been
capable of calling for a taxi, b) be in any
state of mind to agree to the pretenses of
entering her date’s dormitory room and c)
been in a condition to make any logical
decisions whatsoever for that matter.

The other quote you are credited
with, involves your feelings on the decer-
tiﬁcation of the Tri Delta Sorority on the
grounds that they furnished alcohol to
this young lady. “If they had driven drunk
in a car crash, I can guarantee that they
would have been decertiﬁed in twenty
minutes.” This statement, which holds
zero relevance to the fact that a woman
may have been raped, is nothing more
than a lame smoke-screen that places
even more pressure on the young lady
involved in these allegations. Once again,
you are swell enough to victirnize the vic-
tim. V

I view the majority of what you
have written or said, more or less, sug-
gests this young 1ady’s drinking is some-
how correlated to the notion that she may

Madden has succeeded in stimulating the
fear and loathing referred to in his “Fear and
Cigar-smoking in Pittsburg ” (May 6,
1998): fear that opinions articles of the same

caliber as his will become commonplace in,

the pages of The Pitt News, and loathing that
someone with such a dearth of critical think-
ing skills can somehow manage to take up
almost a full page of senseless blathering in
an otherwise respectable newspaper, all the
while maintaining an attitude unapologeti-
cally implying that Madden is of a chosen
few who possess the intellect to arrive at the
same conclusions he does.

How many times has the argument that
cigars are a symbol of a white, male, tyran-
nical, minority-oppressing ruling class been
assimilated by dim-witted minds only to be
vomited back up in all its heinous splendor
and in how many different contexts? While
it is true that Madden’s article is the first
instance I have seen of applying this type of
class-envy whining to cigar smoking, the
ingenuity ends there. If I were to adopt
Madden’s style of “logic,” I would also
complain about the prevalence of blacks in
advertisements for Newport cigarettes and
St. Ides malt liquor. Is this not elitist in the

same way? If Cigar Aﬁcionado is saying,
“Rich whitey and rich whitey wannabes
only welcome in our club,” then I submit
the St. Ides ad campaign as saying, “Black
rappers and rapper wannabes only welcome
in our ‘hood”

A good opinions article will remain
consistent throughout; Madden’s article
failed this litmus test. Shortly after spending
a half page informing the readership that
cigars’ image is that of elitist rich people, he
informs us that premium cigars can fre-
quently be purchased at 7—lls and other
convenience stores across the country. How
elite does Madden consider 7-1 1s?

A ﬁnal quality that a good opinions col-
umn must have is that it must present new
information to the reader, or an alternative
way of interpreting new information for the
reader

Some of the tidbits I learned from Mr.
Madden: the same $20 that can buy a pre-
rniurn cigar can also be used to buy over
150 cigarettes (really?); you don’t inhale
cigar smoke (no wonder they always made
me sick!); a cigar resembles a phallus
(repackaging of others ideas — see
Sigmund Freud, early 1900s); Madden
would rather wear clothes that smell like
cigarette smoke than cigar smoke (Mrs.
Madden, stop adding cigar-scented fabric
softener to dear son Dave’s laundry!); and
cigar smoke stinks (I never knew what to
think of the smell of cigar smoke until
now). '

With new infomration like this and the
enriched outlook on life these bits of kr1owl—
edge offered me, I am now ready to take on
the world.

  Beware the Swedes final psychotic eclipse

Laurence

Byrne

Duringthe ‘50s and ‘60s, liberals,
hippies, homosexuals and other degener-
ates called efforts by concerned Christian
parents to prevent rock’n’roll from inﬁl-
trating mainstream society barbaric, reac-
tionary, Philistine and a breach of the First

Amendment. Well,‘ look no further than ‘

your front porch to see the effects of this
abomination of sound" on society as a
whole. ‘ .

To narrow down this difﬁcult and
broad topic, I will  to Swedish black-
metal band At the Gates as evidence that
the world, much to the amusement of the
band’s members, has gone to hell. Its 1995
album, Slaughter of the Soul, which my
roommate owns and uses to terrorize my
girlfriend Tiffany, and listens to with his
friends while downing 40 oz. bottles of St.
Ides malt liquor, can best be described as
Audio de Sade for the eﬁect it had on my
ears. This vile, un-Christian, unpatriotic
trash should not have reached the shelves
of American CD stores.

Needless to say, Mr. and Mrs. Finlay
will not let me many their daughter after

A graduation if they were to hear this pro-

gression of guitar riffs from hell!

Allow me to give you two physical
descriptions of the typical At the Gates fan:
Joseph Gielata and Damon Hudac. You
know Hudac, he’s an SGB member, and
you may remember that Gielata was his
nmning mate on the Gargoyles slate.
According to a column written by Gielata

President Paul McKrell spread the word
that the two are evil. Though McKrell is a
liberal fool, I do agree with him in this
instance. I wonder — and it’s my pet con-
spiracy theory ——- if Hudac is getting SGB
President Alyson Wallach to do what he
wants by bribing her with St. Ides (the 4.25
A+ plot sounds Hudacish, and more to the
point, At the Gates-ish).

Everyone heed their evil lyrics.

be “Under a Hammer and Sickle,
we shall be forced to live as

columnist Paul Clark for his
superb article in April damning
communism as “a shortsighted
idea.” Communism breeds degener-
ate ﬁlth, and it comes as no surprise
that At the Gates are from Sweden, the
land of welfare, abortion clinics, teenage
mothers, drugs and non-Gentile ‘bergs.
The track “Suicide Nation” is about
rebellion and ﬁghting against mind con-
trol. VV1th this in mind, I decided to rebel
against my roommate and hang my
American ﬂag in its full glory. God
bless America. Add to this that the I
song is called “Suicide Nation,”
advocating, duh, suicide. God excludes
those from heaven who take their own life.
To advocate suicide, and use it as a mar-
keting tool, is sickening. To allow non-
American values to inﬁltrate American CD
stores is morally wrong. .

think it’s humorous that a Christian nation,

Indians, preserves this in their
Constitution.

As American consumers, we must
boycott and openly advocate against
this. At home, we have the likes of

prefer a certain kind of woman —-
busty or waif, depending on the
trend of the day?

A few weeks ago a friend and
I were talking when she suddenly
said, “You know, guys don’t really
like really thin women.”

'Iaskedherwhatshemeant
and she explained she read an arti-
cle in Cosmo (The Man’s
Perspective,” or something like
that) that stated this fact. She said
the author used terms referring to
sex with thin women as “banging a
bag of bones.”

So I looked at this magazine,
andIthenlookedatsomeotherso-
called women’s magazines and
teen magazines. I noticed that in
sections supposed to be about self-
esteem, this “fact” popped up quite
often.

Let me say that more explicit-
ly. In sections supposed
to make women feel better about

their bodies, some bodies were
being put down.
- There’s something very

wrong with this. It is true
advertising, fashion, and television
seem to prefer one sort of woman
——awomanwithaverythinbody.
It is also true many women who
see these images one after another
see their own bodies as somehow
inadequate. It is not progress for
anyone, though, to make naturally
thin women feel bad about their
bodies.

Is the world a better place
when everyone feels there is some-
thing wrong with the way they
look?

“Well, just look inside
Playboy and at Marilyn Monroe,”
said my friend. “Men do like
curves.”

Evolutionarily speaking, that
is true. Curves represent fertility,‘
babies and continuation of one’s
genes. We may in fact lmve a long
memory of what is attractive.
Prosperity was associated with
heaviness. Over time, however,

wealth and power went from being
represental by fat to being! repre-
sented by the lack thereof. As for
right now... ‘

Men like thin women, men
don’t like thin women, men like
curves —— where does any of this
get us? Does this speculation
account for personal preference?
No. Does this speculation make
anyone have a better body image?
Probably not. In the long run,
putting down others to raise one’s
self-irnage leaves one in the same
place as before.

I Is this speculation good for
men? Not at all.

If there are supposed stan-
dards of beauty all women have to
aspireto,tlrenar'eti1esetlrestan-
dards of beauty men think they
have to prefer?

There is a difference between
the women in women’s magazines
and the women in men’s maga-
zines. Just look at swimsuit calen-
dars, posters in dorm rooms and
men’s magazines. Drooling over
these things seems to be an expres-

sion of testosterone. One of my
male friends told me he feels
somewhat forced to participate in
such displays so he doesn’t feel he

On top of this, some men lift
weights, drink high-calorie weight-

gain shakes and bash themselves‘

because that is what they 
women want. Is this progress?

Granted, there are women
who don’t worry about anyof this.
And I have many male friends who
don’t even look at those calendars
or disparage their lanky bodies.
There is such a thing as personal
preference. There is such a thing as
ditference.

That’s whatmakes the_initial
stages of dating fun: checking the
other person out, looking for sorne—
thing physical," emotional, and
mental in another person that
matches what you want.

Lisa Inﬁeld believes its progress
when we forget about all the bull-
shit and tmst our instincts and our
own bodies. ‘

For you to even imply
that there is a, standing rela-

tionship between drinking and ,

sexual assault is absolutely
absurd. It
budges the sword of justice

_ one more time into the heart of

i this young lady. A

L It is a common trend :
nowadays to bastardize the
judicial system. No longer do I

marvel at this trend, for you
have aptly proven that you
deserve your high seat. If you
are a man of justice, and jus-
tice is blind, then how are you
at liberty to make public state-
ments regarding this case? Is
that not the same as entering a
bias into the case?

So in closing, I should
add that underage drinking is a
misdemeanor, whereas rape is
a felony. Rape is the most dis-
gusting act of violence and
violation that I can imagine.

Hello Oscar,
Truman and
Jim Carrey

By HAL TURNER

The sci-ﬁ leaf has turned.

Now the genre's pages are being written by
Andrew Niocol, the innovative writer behind The
Truman Show.

Whereas the Star Wars trilogy was the last magical
and successful sci-ﬁ to show that humans will suffer
from human nature no matter where, no matter when,
The Truman Show takes the viewer to a world where
the basic value of life is grossly perverted. It follows
Niccols’ other 1984-esque triumph, Gattaca.

The ﬁlm's world, a pre-fab town called Sea Haven,
resembles "19 ” and ”Brave New World” in its por-
trayal of those who control the environment and
watch you in it. But it moves much further inward to
become a world within a world, where people have no

for humanity — where a corporation can
adopt a child and put him in a cage for everyone’s
amusement.

It’ s a world so contrived and corporate that you
have to suppress the vornitous feeling in your gut. But
you'll giggle when you realize you must accept The
Truman Show’s dystopia as just that. Instead of a sick-
ening reﬂection of contemporary morals, it’ s a fun-
house-rnirrored look, a twisted,  version of
today, with the evils that folks can see but can't bear to
change. T

Detective) is Truman

who's lived his life

to hold up a product and pitch it to a confused
Truman. After all, there's no commercial interruption,
24 hours a day. Yes, these people even televise Truman
while he sleeps, and somebody’s got to pay for it.

Sea Haven's creator, Christof, played by Ed Harris
(The Abyss, Apollo 13), perfectly represents several
characters in the movie's textured levels: cre-
ator of "The Truman Show” and God in that
world, father ﬁgure to Truman in the pursuit
to mold him and watch him grow, director
and producer of the internationally-viewed
television show starring Truman, and
warped / caring captor of the baby his com-
pany adopted 30 years earlier.

Raising the boy and facing his possible departure
from the little coast-town mimics a parent’ s dilemma
of watching a child leave home. It can even be said that
because ”The Truman Show” made Christof a world-
renowned television icon, his stock in Trurnan’s liveli-
hood can be equated to a successful parent passing his
genes along to offspring who survive to do the same.

You simply cannot ﬁnd one loophole in the plot.

Rent is a musical that can intrigue
every audience member. The most glar-

The story is told by Mark, a docu-
men ﬁlmmaker, who lives with
Roger in a beat-up building in the Big
Apple. Roger is an HIV-positive gui-
tarist, high on hopes, low on talent and
recovering from a heavy drug addic-
tion. He falls for Mimi, a hooker and
dancer at an S&M club, who is also HIV-
positive and a former addict. The
two form quite a storied pair.

build a high-tech cyber-arts studio on
the property, clearing out the homeless
and evicting everyone from the build-
mg.

In response, Maureen schedules a

   
      
 
   

performance protest for
midnight on Christmas
Eve. Benny attempts to
thwart her protest by get-
ting Mark and Roger to
make a deal —— if they con-
vince Maureen not to carry
out her plan, they can stay
in the building rent-free.

Not surprisingly,
Maureen's protest happens 
and a riot breaks out. Benny 
padlocks the building and
everyone else tries to break
in on New Year's Eve. The
rest of the musical plays out over the
next year, following the lives of the 10 or
so characters and the relationships
they've formed.

Unfortunately, the plot peters out
by the close, leaving the audience to do
some guesswork But the score and
ﬁghting make up for any deficiencies in
the storyline. The lighting work
received a 1996 Tony nomination and
acts as an extension of the score, which
combines hard rock, blues, Christmas
carol parodies and classic rock with
incredible ease.

The cast of Rent presented by the Broadway Series

Rent received its world premiere
off-Broadway at New York Theatre
Workshop on Feb. 13, 1996, two weeks
after its writer, Jonathan Larson, died of
AIDS. It rapidly became a sold-out hit,
moving to Broadway on April 29, 1996.
It continues to play to standing-room-
only audiences.

The most honored musical since A
Chorus Line in 1976, Rent is only the fifth
musical ever to win both the Pulitzer
Prize and the Tony Award.

Thankfully, the show here has not
yet sold out.

Matthews Band combines various ele-

sound and genre in music that provides
an alternative to angry or pure pop

Matthews says that making music

his mother and family. From South
Africa, he proceeded to New York and
settled in Charlottesville, Va.

There, he worked at a jazz bar,
where he met Leroi Moore, who plays

Bassist Stefan Lessard entered the
picture on a friend's recommendation.
Finally, they decided that the band
needed a violin, so they asked Boyd
Tinsley, a regular at the UVA hippie frat
house they frequented, to join.

The incredible talent of each band

playing in fraternities and clubs and
small touring gigs with bands such as

So before the machine of the music
industry even kicked in, they had
achieved the devotion of a large fan
base that has continued to grow as the
band released four albums —
Remember Two Things, Under the Table

Crash is the best example of the
band's style with ”Say Goodbye,” a
mellow ballad about denying lust for

Pittsburgh athletics:
on the way up

Pitt Athletics.

This name has brought sneers, jeers,
jokes and laughter all over the country and
in Pittsburgh for the last decade. People
made ﬁm of the school. The cheers went
something like this: Pitt-eat-shit and Pitt-is-
shit. They were very creative and rhyrned
so well.

I guess you get the point by now. Pitt
was not the most respected school in
Division I, and many people made that
known. Then something amazing hap-
pened Steve Pederson came into the pic-
ture from Nebraska and changed those jeers
to cheers of joy ﬁom the Pit faithful.

Not because the athletics program sud-
denly became great, but because he
changed the name, logo and image of the
program Granted, the teams were not
world-class caliber, but the new look gave
the school a positive self—irnage.

For the last year we’ve had Pittsburgh
Athletics. '

"This phrase has a new connotation all
over the country. People hear it and they
think of an up-and-oomirrg athletics pro-
gram with great leadership and a bright
future. Could a name used for less than a
year really do all of this?

Of course not. It took a change of phi-

losophy on part of the school, the athletics‘

department and the athletes ‘to make this
giant leap to respectability. It started last
year with the football team and continued
throughout the season. All the teams made
a strong showing and exhibited the same
drive as the football team

Students were asked if they “Believed”
and were subjected to Patti LaBelle singing
“New Attitude” throughout the whole year.
This song and phrase inundated the cam-
pus, summarizing the new direction of the
athletics program

The football team went to its ﬁrst bowl
game in almost apdecade. The track team
watched Trecia Smith jump into the record
books. Fran Davis shattered victory records
for the tennis team. The wrestling team
boasted three All—Americans and the
Freshman of the Year. The men’s swim-
ming and diving team won its second
straight Big East title. The softball team
beganplay.AlltheotherteamsatPitt(or
should I say Pittsburgh) showed the deter-
mination and desire we are beginning to
expect here.

People on campus are not the only
ones to recognize this change. The NCAA
recently came to evaluate Pittsburgh in a
standard procedure, and their ﬁndings were
complimentary. Like every other school,
Pittsburgh has some changes to make, but
when one runs a huge operation like this

You know that feeling of anxiety
you get after taking a test? The armoying
curiosity you feel in your gut from the
time you put your pencil down until you
ﬁnally get your score back one, two or
even three weeks later?

Well, the University is in that state
right now because the NCAA is ﬁnish-
ing its Athletic Certiﬁcation of the
University of Pittsburgh. The ofﬁcial
draft report hasn’t been issued yet, but
Pitt can breath easy because it looks like
our school will fare just ﬁne and have its
athletic programs re-certiﬁed.

“While we don’t have the oﬁicial
draft report, the verbal feedback we have
gotten has been very, very positive,” said
John Elliott, Pitt’s Director of Internal
Audit.

The certiﬁcation process is a long
and involved production, similar to a
school’s academic accreditation, that
every NCAA Division I school goes

through once every 10 years. *

This evaluation is designed to make
sure Pitt complies with regulations in
four primary areas of focus: governance,
academic integrity, ﬁscal integrity and

commitment to gender equity.

THE PIT!‘ if I P; .l:  0 R I S WEDNESDAY, 3 |uNr 1998 1 3

Pi wais for NCAA’s evaluation

The process begins with a yearlong
university self-audit. The school then
produces a report based on the ﬁndings
of that audit which is submitted to a peer-
review team made up of administrators
and faculty from various colleges and
universities across the country.

They read over the data and inter-
view over 50 administrative, faculty and
student leaders. They then make sure
Pitt’s self—audit is accurate, and make
recommendations to the University in
the four areas of concentration.

“I can’t comment on our commit-
tee’s recommendations until Pittsburgh
receives the ofﬁcial report from the
NCAA,” explained John Byme, chair-
man of the peer review team who is also
President Emeritus of Oregon State
University. “But I can say, in my person-
al opinion, that Pittsburgh did an
admirable job. They treated us very well,
they got us any information we needed.”

After the peer review team is ﬁn-
ished, all of the thrilling reports are then
turned over to the NCAA’s Committee
on Athletic Certiﬁcation, also composed
of ofﬁcials from other colleges, who
detemrine if the school will be eligible to
participate in NCAA athletics.

and the ‘release of Donnell Woolford. Scott
went down in olf-season drills at Three
Rivers Stadium early this spring. The
Steelers cut Woolford because they needed
his almost one million dollars under the
salary cap.

Orlandini steps into a position that is
always looked at as great on the Pittsburgh
Steelers’ team: the offensive line. '

The Steelers’
offensive line has
been one of the best
in the league for
years.’ Franco Harris
ran behind a stellar
offensive line, and
the Steelers have
been near the top of
the league every year
in rushing, regardless
of the running back,
whether it be Merril
Hoge, Barry Foster,
Bam Morris or
Jerome Bettis.

All of these backs had career years
behind the Steelers’ great offensive lines.
Orlandini tries to step in among the likes of
Dermonti Dawson, Wﬂl Woolford; Jim

‘Sweeney, Brendon Stai, Jarnaine Stevens

and Paul VVrggins.

Orlandini, a three-year letter winner,
was selected to the ﬁrst-team" All
Conference Squad in the Big East and was
the only Panther to receive such honors.
Orlandini also played in the East-West
Shrine Classic at Stanford Stadium.

He allowed only 1 1/2 sacks last year
and recorded six pancakes in his senior

campaign. He also graded out over 90 per-

 

Orlnadini anchored Pitt’s offensive line last year.

cent in 10 of his 11 games.

These Pitt stars join Sweeney as the
only Panthers on the Steelers’ roster. Jerry
Olsavsky played with the team during their
Super Bowl appearance but has since
moved on to the Cincinnati Bengals.
Olsavsky played his college ball at Pitt and
was one of the school’s great linebackers.

The Steelers start their rnini-carnp
today and will proceed through the rest of
the week in team meetings, watching ﬁlms
and running non—contact drills. Training
camp starts sometime in July and will run
until the beginning of the season at St
Vmcent’s College in Latrobe.

athletics department,
inevitable. —

The athletics program needs to make a few
changes to comply with Title IX and also needs
to update some old facilities. But these
improvements are on their way.

The convocation center, new tennis courts,
turf on the inﬁeld at Trees Field, renovations to
the Field House and better facilities for all the
teams are expected to be completed by the next
century. '

People all over the country can see
Pittsburgh’s slow but steady rise‘ back to
respectability. The Mountaineers know all
about it. The other swimming teams have seen
it. Architects know about it ﬁom all of the bid-
ding on buildings. Pittsburgh is back on the
map of college athletics and hopefully here to
stay. Between Pederson, Walt Harris, Traci
Waites, Ralph Willard and all of the other
coaches, the new attitude is contagious in the
athletics department and has spread to all the
fans. ;
Just walking around Pittsburgh and its
suburbs, one sees more Pittsburgh shirts and
hats popping up. T'hey’re beginning to rival
Penn State gear in Oakland, and more and more
stores are stocking Pittsburgh apparel.

The fans are doing just what everyone
hoped They have seen the changes and are
responding by going to games and buying mer-
chandise.

A fan cannot help being excited for next
sports season. It is possible that both the bas-
ketball and football teams could crack the top-
25 nationally this year, if they play as well as
last year. Bowls, tournaments, championships
— who knows?

The change of logo and name brought
about controversy last year, but it has taken well
and changed the face of athletics here.

Pittsburgh athletics are back in the spot-
light in Pittsburgh and they’re here to stay.

Patrick Robertson is the sports editor of
the Pitt News and would love to see all of these
things wpen because he has taken quite a lik-
ing to Pittsburgh athletics aﬂer escaping
Mountaineer country in northern West Virginia.

NCAA

Pitt is now at this point in the evaluation.
Once ﬁnished, the committee will send the
University the ofﬁcial draft report sometime
within the next week or two. At that point, Pitt
will make a public announcement concerning
the speciﬁc ﬁndings of the certiﬁcation.

Schools rarely have problems receiving
their certiﬁcation and according to Pitt
administrators, the University is conﬁdent the
results will be favorable.

This evaluation ensures Pitt is following
the NCAA’s rules and regulations. Things
like athletes working, athletes academic stan-
dards, use of public money for athletic pur-
poses, operating principles, and gender equi-
ty issues are all addressed.

While the safety and equity of athletic
facilities are evaluation, the actual quality of
the facilities is not addressed. This means the
recent explosion of dollars toward improving

Pitt guard Vonteego Cummings
was not named a ﬁnalist for the USA
Basketball Men’s National Team after
the three-day trials in Colorado.

The tryouts ran this past weekend.
Only 33 college hoopsters were invit-
ed, and a scant 17 were named ﬁnal-
ists on Monday. Of those chosen, two

were centers, nine were forwards and

six were guards. The selection com-
mittee will eventually wlrittle the
amount down to a 12—member team to
compete in the Goodwill Games this
July.

‘ The only Big East player among
the 17 was 5—foot—10—inch Connecticut

each category. In addition, Cummings
averaged a staggering 40.1 minutes
per game, setting a new league record.

In other news, Pitt forward Latia
Howard has been cleared to play next
year under new Head Coach Traci
Waites. Howard’s future as an athlete
was questionable after a very serious
disease last year.

Howard had surgery late in 1997 --
for a bacterial infection on her mitral
valve. Originally she thought she only
had a case of anemia, but the infection
was discovered by Dr. Freddy Fu.

Howard’s condition was so seri-
ous that many doctors wondered why
she had not yet had a stroke or heart
attack as a result of the infection.

The surgery was a success and 

since. She said yesterday that she has
full medical clearance to play and

Players and coaches praise Pittsburgh Athletics

Mora Mattern
For The Pitt News

After a stellar ﬁrst season as the
Pittsburgh Panthers, the University’s
coaches, players and administrators all
have great things to say about the athletic
PY0gmm- ,

Since the NCAA did its evaluation of
Pitt’s athletic depar1ment, many people
expressed their views on the department in
general and Athletic Director Steve
Pederson, speciﬁcally. V

Kirk Bruce, the assistant athletic direc-
tor and former women’s basketball coach,
said he feels a lot has improved.

“We’re conveying to the general pub-
licthatweareaﬁrst-classprogramallthe
way around, in every sports program we
have,” he said. » .

Billy West, one of Pitt’s football play-
ers who graduated this spring, commented
on the fans’ newfound enthusiasm.

“The support at home is not even com-
parable to other years,” he said. West also
noted that Steve Pederson has done a lot to
spark interest in the public and to create an
enjoyable atmosphere for fans and athletes
alike. In addition, he said the new replay
screen added to the excitement.

All of the comments were not positive,
though. West had some concerns after fac-
ing criticism from the national media and
losing his starting position because of miss-
ing practice one night a week last season.

_ An issue West thus raised is that ath-
letics and academics need to become more
compatible. An engineering graduate, West
said there are problems mixing athletics
with course curricula. He said there should
be a set practice schedule so students don’t
have to miss practice for class and vice-
versa.

“Whether you’re in CAS, CGS,
Engineering or any other program, they
shouldn’t shy athletes away because of
majors,” he said.

Kirk Bruce voiced another concern. “I
would personally like to see more student
involvement in other sports [besides foot-
ball] ,” he said.

Most people interviewed thought the
athletic  was going well on the
whole, and they believe the new image is a

‘ result of Steve Pederson’s efforts.

Roland Sturk, the women’s soccer
coach, thinks one of the best things the
University did was to hire Pederson as the
athletic director. Sturk is one of the newest
coaches on campus and he said he came
here with high hopes and aspirations.

“VV1th Pederson,” he said, “anything’s
possible.”

With the addition of a softball team,
Coach Michelle Phelan is brand new to the
program She said everything with softball
has been excellent- all of the departments
and coaches have given her wonderful sup-
port.
“This is a very positive atmosphere. I
haven’t even been here a year, and it’s been
nothing but a great experience,” she said.

Seth Homack, a junior and member of
Pitt’s football team, said he’s noticed a lot
more enthusiasm around campus.

“We’re getting a lot more attendance,
and I see a lot more people wearing Pitt
paraphernalia than I did my ﬁrst year here,”
he said. “It might have something to do
with the new logo, but I think it’s also a
good signhthat we ﬁnally made it to a bowl
game.”

Homack mentioned the monetary
donations Pitt has received.

“This helps recruiting, and it helps the
city in general,” he said. He also mentioned

happiness with Pitt’s plans for a new con-
vocationcenter.

Nick Mengerink of Pitt’s wrestling
team also agrees Pederson is doing a great
job. “The wresting program is deﬁnitely on
its way up,” he said.

Mengerink is a junior who was an All-
American wrestler last year, as well as the
Eastern Wrestling League Freshman of the
Year. He said he is especially pleased since
Pitt remodeled the wrestling room last year
and put a new locker room in the Field
House. He saidhethinksthatallofﬂiese
improvements, along with the new convo-
cation center, will help the overall recruit-
ment process for upcoming seasons.

Erin Shalbrack, a senior women’s ten-
nis player, shares the positive opinion of
Pitt’s athletic director.

“Everyone gets along well with

Pederson,” she said.

Regarding the tennis team, she said the
players are really excited about the three
new courts being built in the Cost Center.
The new courts will have NCAA surfaces,
“giving us top-notch facilities,” she said.

Shalbrack also believes that the image
itself has improved because of the new
logo. She said fans and athletes are more
enthusiastic.

“The athletes are also becoming more
active with other teams, not just their own,’ ’
she said A member of the Student Athletic
Board, Shalbrack said she is helping to plan
a lot of events for all athletes, including a
picnic this summer.

Overall, the attitude remains positive.

Roland Sturk said, “I’m pretty happy.
I love my job and the kids I’m working
with. The main thing that has to improve
are the facilities, and we are moving in the
right direction. I don’t know what there is
to complain about.”
