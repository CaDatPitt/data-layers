Maybe getting together with friends and complaining
will be productive after all.
At least that’s what Student Government Board thinks.
On Wednesday night, about 40 students showed up for
the first “What Can SGB Do for You?” forum, hosted by
SGB’s public relations committee.
_ “We’re here to find out what you have concerns with,”
said Laura Askin, co—chair of the public relations committee.
“When we had a forum like this last year we came up
with the fifth ﬂoor renovations and our new Web site,” SGB

‘President Joan Snyder said.

Many of the students at the forum wereeager to share
their concerns.
“The changes to C—side have made it take longer to get

food,” Steve ‘Nikoloff said. “It’s sometimes hard to tell

who’s even in line.”
Nikoloff also asked why more registers aren’t open in

r the Schenley Cafe and why the back room is closed during

the evening.

Vice Provost and Dean of Students Sharon Johnson was
also present at the forumland asked students to e—mail her or
stop by her office to voice their opinions.

S “It would also be good if more off—campus places would
take dining dollars,” SGB member Shahrooz Bhopti said.

Students asked why the University doesn’t allow more
than six blocks to be used in a day._. ‘

While many of the gripes centered around food services
on campus, several public safety issues also arose.

"‘My roommate is’ an athlete,” one student said. “And

C‘ .. they have practice really early in the morning on the 'hill.—

Playroom helps

JUSTIN MCCLELLAND

Staff Writer _

Chris Statile is learning how to
make a lizard out of beads.

He’s being shown the tedious and
confusing process - it involves a twist-
ed piece of black wire Scotch taped to
a desk and loaded with hundreds of
small colored beads — by a 13-year-
old who suffered a severe asthma
attack in school Monday and has been
in the hospital since

“Here’s where you add the eyes,”
she informed him.

“Geez,” he said. “Do you know
how to do this by heart?”

Statile is volunteering in the
Medical -Free Playroom at the
Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh, a
special room where sick children are
allowed to play, free from doctors and
painful tests.

Denise Esposto, who runs the play-
room for Children’s said that children
who are allowed to play are proven to
recover faster than bed—ridden young-
sters.

“It at least gets them out of bed,
moving around and maybe feeling’ a
little bit better,” she said.

As if to mark her words, a young
intern carried a toddler into the room,

dressed in a dull hospital gown with
gauze wrapped around her throat. A
glow almost seemed to resonate off the

major, but after his experiences in the
playroom has decided to change his
major to child development.

Finnigan said that even a simple _

must be performed outside the room.

Aaron Webb, a sophomore at Pitt,
has worked in the playrooms for three
semesters as part of his work~study
program.

“It’s just fun in here,” Webb said.
“It’s a different experience to help
these kids forget why they’re here.”

Pitt junior Angela Fragnito sat just
outside a mountain of colorful noise
makers surrounding another ailing tod-
dler with a special path made through
the plastic goodies for his IV tube.

“Are you even paying attention to
me?” Fragnito joked as the toddler
pounded away on a rainbow colored
Xylophone and “Twinkle Twinkle
Little Star,” hummed in the back-

kids escape sickness

Fragnito and Statile both got
involved with the playroom through
last year’s volunteer fair. Both are biol-
ogy majors who were looking for a
way to get involved at a local hospital.

“I’ll probably want to work with
kids when I graduate,” Fragnito said.
‘-‘I know Idefinitely love to play with
them.”

Besides plastic music makers the
playroom has drawers full of board
games, Barbies, a crafts table where

- Statile makes his ornamental lizard and

two computers. One of the computers
is equipped with Starbright, a program
linking the hospital playroom to over a
hundred others across the country.

“It allows the children, to talk to
other sick kids and meet people with
the same illness,” Esposto said.

Above Fragnito, white paper is
taped to the wall, and divided into two
sections; “Likes” and “Dislikes.”
While the dislikes board is filled with
entries ranging from the serious -
shots —- to the absurd — smelly cheese
— the likes board contains one entry
repeated several times: “The play-
room.”

Online job search

AMANDA BAYER

Staff Writer

Students who are unsure of what type
of career they want to pursue have many
options available to help them determine the
line of work that would work best for them.

Of course, students may want to work
with a career adviser, but they can also now
look to the Internet for help with their career
choices. T

“The Internet possesses a wealth of
career information for people at all stages of
their career development,” said Kelli
Robinson, a career advisor for Placement
and Career Services at Pitt. .

But Robinson stressed that students
need to understand how to go about con

' ducting career searches online; V

“When using the Internet, it’s important
to have a targeted job search in mind.
Otherwise, the amount of information one
can ﬁnd will get overwhelming and not be
much help in the long run.”

Robinson suggested that students work
with a career adviser to identify their job
interests, and then build a list of career
resources, which may include the Web.

The America’s Career Infonet Web site,
www.acinet.org/acinet, has many useful
searches for students looking for a career.
Students can search ﬂie “General Outlook,”
which predicts trends in the job market for
different education levels. The “Wages and
Tren ” area links to more detailed pages
with infomiation about whatever occupa-

tion the students select. The “State Proﬁles”
available on this site display state demo-
graphic and economic data, and links to
educational, cultural and recreational sites.
The “Resource Library” is a list of more

than 3,000 additional career related Web ~

sites. .

The Occupational Outlook’s home
page is located at
www.bls.gov/ocohome.htrn. The

Handbook is a nationally recognized source '

of career information and is designed to pro-
vide valuable assistance to individuals mak-
ing decisions about their future work.
Students can type a speciﬁc career in the
search box, search through a list of all occu-
pations or research multiple careers by
browsing through listings using the occupa-
tional cluster buttons. The clusters include
categories such as management, profession-
al, technical, armed forces and others. The
Occupational Outlook Handbook is revised
every two years.

Another site, www.ncsu.edu/careerkey,
is a “free public service to help people make
sound career decisions.” Students can take
the “Career Key Measure” which evaluates
personality types. Based on the results, stu-
dents can create a list of potential jobs.

Students can also learn why their per-
sonality type is good for a particular career.
One section on this site teaches students
how to make important decisions by taking
into account alternatives, consequences,
information and plans. The site also shows

students how to choose an appropriate train-

ing program or college major.

No money, mo problems

TAMARA SIMPSON

Staff Writer

When students in Sutherland Hall

' need fast cash, they have to borrow money

from a friend, or hike down the hill to ﬁnd
an ATM. If the Sutherland Resident
Student Association has its way, an ATM
will be installed in the building in the near
future.

“In the past, the reason for not having
an ATM in Sutherland was because in the
summer, it wouldn’t be used by students,”
said Jon Janisak, Sutherland’s resident
director.

Janisak, along with the RSA board, is
pushing for the installation of an ATM.

The board argues that the ATM would
see use in the summer.

“Some students that take summer
courses have a chance at being assigned to
Sutherlan ,” said Chris Olsheski, RSA’s
public relations representative.

According to Janisak, resident assis-
tants and students that attend summer ath-

letic camps are all prospective summer,

ATM users.

“In the summer, there have \been
around 500 summer campers in this build-
ing asking where they can use an ATM,”
J anisak said. ..

According to Olsheski, one of the
major obstacles to the placement of an
ATM is that it costs $15,000. University
ofﬁcials are talking with various store fran-
chises in hopes of choosing one to place in
Sutherland Hall.

“I wo11ld imagine that if a 24-hour
store is placed in Sutherland, the ATM

would be installed there, but I am really

unsure of where exactly the machine
would be locat ,” Olsheski said.

It is also uncertain what bank would
be chosen for the ATM.

“If it isn’t a National City machine,
then it won’t help me much, because I will
still have to hike it down to Atwood,” said
Sutherland resident Shannon
Golembiewski.

Some students are willing to pay the
ATM fee for the convenience.

“I always try to avoid fees from using
other banks’ machines, but ifl really need
money right away, then I will ,use the
machine regardless,” Janisak said. I

“I know that the soap dispensers

Johnson said. “But I don’t know when
they’ll be installed.” ,

Some upperclassmen didn’t agree
with the decision to install new dis-
pensers and dryers.»

“Why should they put something in

Steve Federrnan asked.

, “In Bouquet Gardens, there’s only

I one washer and dryer per ﬂoor,” Meyer

said. “The caulking is bad and our
dishwasher is put in wrong. All of these

V things are wrong because they put it

together so quickly. In two years the

place will be really trashed.”
Toward the end of the. forum, stu-

explain their concerns to SGB.mem—

bers. .
“What we might want to do is

appoint some students to advisory

Ideas for Creation Station

While not" the most socially con-
structive pastime, watching television
can certainly be enjoyable, and the
more channels, the better. That’s why
the plans of two Pitt juniors to revive
the currently non-functioning Honors
College channel is cause for celebra-
tion.

John Paul Horstmann and Ryan
Harvie are the artistic masterminds,
planning on calling the charmel
“Creation Station.” If their plans suc-
ceed, the campus will have an option
other than Pitt TV for student—run tele-
vision.

Since they are starting from
scratch, Horstmarm and Harvie have
ample opportunity to design program-
ming that Pitt students in particular
should ﬁnd appealing. In creating the
channel, Horstmarm and Harvie might
consider:

- A sports show featuring replays,
highlights and scores of games.
Naturally the major varsity sports
should be included, but Creation
Station should also provide coverage
for club and intramural teams.

- A news program, as some folks
prefer to get their news ﬁom television.
The Pitt News could collaborate to
ensure that major campus happenings
get multimedia coverage.

0 Martha Stewart and her “Living”
show have done wonders for home-
makers across America. Pitt needs its
own Martha to provide lessons in how

to manage cute decorating in minimal
space and teach students to make dorm
rooms look cozy and homey.

-Adating game show to service all
the lonely hearts on campus. Itwould
provide students with an easier way to
meet members of the opposite sex than
attempting to pick up people at parties.

- Game shows in general are a
good idea Who wants to be a PittFunds
millionaire?

- “’The Real World” Pitt—style: stu-
dents crowd into a lovely three-bed-
room apartment somewhere in South
Oakland and provide mucho shallow
entertaining drama as they ﬁght, hook
up with each other, etc.

0 In addition to a weather forecast,
students with meal plans would surely
enjoy a cafeteria forecast featuring the
daily specials. Off-campus students
might appreciate a “Frugal Gourmet”
type of thing, focusing on new ways to
use such ingredients as peanut butter
and Ramen noodles.

- A “Cops” spin-oﬁ  the
Pitt police as they break up parties and

' bust students for underage drinking.

The recipe for success here is rela-
tively simple — combine that unique
brand of low—grade humor that many
college students share with informa-
tional programs relevant to campus life.
By listening to what the student body
wants and combining the funny with
the informative, Creation Station just
might rival even MTV in popularity.

And there I was, living the illustrious lifestyle
of a supermarket employee — it was summer job
time, and I had scored the best worst-paying work
on the market That stupid Poindexter waddling
around aisle six restocking the Stovetop, was me.

Well, I sure looked awesome. I _
was decked out in grizzled -khakis; BEN

‘ domiing the gorgeous navy blue col‘-
ored shirt, emblazoned on ﬂie sleeve
with the bold, silver, God—fearing
words ‘Food Fare,’ draped in a
rough, starched apron that was as maroon as a
big, fat brick; and topped off with my perfect,
new ‘name tag — “Hello, my name is BEN.” It
was a sight for sore eyes.

Little did I know that, as I happily stacked the
green beans, I’d be ﬁred in three measly days.

The story goes thus: After way too much
elfort, I managed to get myself a summer job. I
was pretty excited to be working at Food Fare,

Adventures in grocery land

People would bring popcom to watch, and if they
didn’t have any they’d buy some in the store, pop
it up, and watch this guy go.

He “fronted,” which means moving the
products to the -way edge of the shelf so that when
’ you look down the aisle a glorious
wall of food jumps out at you from
both sides screaming, “Buy me or
I’ll maul your face off!” Well, this
man fronted with lightning speed

and loaded up in just enougr time to hit up a high

mind, he was nothing like Yoda. He was pretty
much the only person I knew, talked to and
worked with. It’s not like I had much time to set-

Pitt look t be on the inninrac

KENNETH PAUL

Senior Staff Writer

This Saturday, at Three Rivers
Stadium, Pitt looks to exorcise some
demons when they meet Boston
College in a Big East showdown.

Boston College has won seven_of
the last 10 meetings between the two
schools, including a dramatic 20-16
come-from-behind victory last sea-
son. »
BC comes into the game with a 4-
2 record and are 1-2 in the Big East.
Pitt brings a 4-1 record and 1-1 in
Big East play.

The game is important for each
team, as both are trying to‘ reach the
six-win plateau, which makes teams
bowl—e1igible.

The Eagles are coming off of a
big 20-13 win over Syracuse, the
same team that Pitt lost to in double
overtime two weeks ago, 24-17.

Pitt has had two weeks to prepare
for the game, as they had a week off
after the Syracuse game. This week-
end’s game kicks off six consecutive
weeks of stiff competition for the
Panthers.

Making his season debut against

Syracuse for BC was Cedric
Washington. Washington, who made
his return from a knee injury, ran for
77 yards in the game.

Although Washington had not
played until the Syracuse game, the
BC running attack was strong all
year, as backup William Green
picked up the slack.

Green has rushed for 446 yards in
his last three games which includes a
107-yard performance versus
Syracuse and a 117-yard game
against Virginia Tech. The running
back is averaging 6.2 yards per carry
and has nine touchdowns for the year.
He has plenty of speed as he burned
Syracuse for a 65-yard run.

While BC’s running offense has
been superb, its running defense has
been poor.

BC’s defense gave up 306 rush-
ing yards against Syracuse last week-
end. Defensive tackle Chris Hovan
graduated and now plays for the
Minnesota Vikings. The loss in the
middle has hurt the line immensely.

On the defensive line, BC has
Keith Leavitt, 6 feet 6 inches, 316
pounds, starting at right tackle.
Leavitt is a huge body but is inexpe-
rienced, as he is only a freshman.

1973: Dorsett and Daniels combine
to lead Panthers past Eagles, 28-14

Editor’s Note: This is the eighth of the “Greatest Games”
series that will appear in The Pitt News the day before each
Pitt football game this year. Each part in the series will
detail Pitt's greatest game against that week’s opponent, and
will contain the original game story as it appeared in The
Pitt News. This story was published on Oct. 22, 1973 and

was written by Vince Di Nardo.

CHESTNUT HILL, Mass. — A
methodical Pitt Panther football
squad went a long way in showing
they are for real Saturday afternoon,
downing a highly touted Boston
College team 28-14.

Really, the 14-point spread was
no indication of the game. The
Eagles were more outclassed on the
stat sheet. This was surprising since

the game was billed as a showdown of the east’s most

improved teams.

Johimy Majors, who referred to the game as the “cross-
roads” for both teams, now finds his team with a chance to

 

now, the Panthers 3-2-1 record is the best since they were 5-
1 under Carl DePasqua in 1970.

Under the discreet leadership of quarterback Bill
Daniels, the Cats ran 35 more offensive plays than the
Eagles and moved the sticks 19 times to eight. Pitt rushed for
14 first downs and passed for 5 more. Daniel’s counterpart,

Gary Marangi, led his team to three first downs

through the air and four more on the ground.‘
Daniels rushed for 71 yards on 21 carries
and scored two more touchdowns. That brought
his total to seven on the season. In fact, Daniels
and Tony Dorsett have had a hand .in every Pitt
touchdown. The only touchdown that didn’t come
from this “dynamic duo” was a 25-yard pass from
Daniels to Rodney Clark against Baylor. . V
Dorsett had another great day. “TD” scam-
pered for 109 yards on 29 carries — bringing his

season total to 823 — along with two scores.

The Cats won the toss and elected to receive_. It worked

well, as Daniels took his team 80 yards in 14 plays.

18   holes of golf, but

A couple of weeks ago, I was fortu-

_ inate to appear in a golf tournament at

Venango Trail Golf Club in Warrendale,
Pa.

Having only played in two golf tour-
naments previous to this one, I expected

. little more than a ftm round of 18 holes.
I got more than I. bargained for as I

some of Pittsburgh’s best amateurs

showed up for one of the most memorable

sporting events of my life.

Among the top competitors were .

Keith Schreiber of Allison Park, Merle
Owens of the South Hills and
Ed Colerich of Franklin Park.

I got teamed up with my

‘ brother, Eric Ford,_ Colerich and ,
my partner for the day, Steve 
Owens.

over our heads, a ‘-like money,

and a toilet—training'~‘  for 5;:

and things startedoﬁipoorly. p  A

My first tee sliott» was
never found. It could have -
landed in the lake to the right of
the fairway. It could have been gobbled up
by one of the hundreds of geese that roam
the course. Who knows?_

I dropped another ball and hit my third
shot from the vicinity I thought it might

On most golf courses, bright white
dimpled balls may be easy to find, but not
at Venango Trail. All of this happened after
the most signiﬁcant event of the day.

I showed up in a Pitt Liberty Bowl
long-sleeve T-shirt to show my pride for
the Panthers, but my apparel was quickly
rejected by the starter. »

The man behind the counter looked
upon me with disgust and told me I need-
ed a collared shirt. .

After arguing with him about the need
for a collar on a shirt, I accepted a green-
ish rent—a-shirt that was given to me for no
collateral by the starter. The shirt was two
sizes too small, had stains on one sleeve
and the color was god-awful.

I guess it was more of a lend-a-shirt
than a rented one, but tell that to the direc-
some I played with.

My nickname became “Rent” for the
day, and every bad shot was blamed on the
“damn rent—a-shirt.”

  just ne shot matters

If you’ve never been to Warrendale or
played Venango Trail, I suggest you keep
it as far away as possible in future plans.

The course was being aerated as we

played, and tons of small, cylindrical-A

shaped  clumps were lying on the fair-

' way.

‘ Besides making it more difficult to

find. the "perfect drive into the middle of the A

_ There /were par—ﬁve

from the previous shot.

The four of us became
quite bitter with the course,
the game of golf and each

other fornot seeing where

The best shots of the day occurred on

the seventh hole, when Ford, Colerich and

I all downed a shot of Goldschlager. I
don’t think I would have made it through
the remaining holes without it.

Ford shot a 113. Colerich and Owens
rivaled each other for the worst golfer in
the tournament. Me? I shot a 106, but lost
ﬁve balls in the fairway.

Because of the adjusted scoring sys-
tem used, Steve Owens and I won the
prize for top team, each pocketing some
cash. I also won a few gift certiﬁcates, but
those accolades paled in comparison to the
most enjoyable round of golf I’ve ever
played.

There were lost clubs, lost balls,
whiffs, ﬂubbed shots, swear words I’ve
never heard of before, poor putting, goose
shit and four amateurs that had no right
being in a tournament. Plus, that rent—a-
shirt is still lying in my golf bag.

That’s fun.

Brad Cuprik is the assistant sports editor
of the Pitt News and would like to thank
Ford and Colerich for playing Michael
Jacksonis “Thriller” as he teed oﬁ’ on the
18th hole. A .

Pitt’s men’s swimming team has
Won the Big East title four consecu-
tive years. This year, with the entrance
of Virginia Tech, head coach Chuck
Knoles says a change in the Big East
tournament was made but not in the
Pitt team itself.

“It used to be that each school got
18 participants in the tournament.
Now you have to qualify to be in the
tournament,” Knoles said. “Three or
more schools will have no one repre-
sented [in the Big East tournament].”

_ The qualifying times Knoles is
referring to is the new system for the
Big East swimming tournament.
Before each season begins, all Big
East coaches will sit down and deter-

. mine a time to set as the qualifying
time for a swimmer to beat in order to
make the Big East tournaments. This
means that some schools could have
as many as every swimmer on the
team qualify, yet other schools might
not have one.

“This [qualifying system] will
make schools work harder,” Knoles

, said. »“The Big East wanted to elevate
the quality of championships.” .

handed the ball to fullback Dave

J anesek; heretofore never to be referred ,

to as a “glorified guard.” With Dorsett
as the decoy, Janesek burst through the
middle for 20 yards on the second play
of the game. Daniels picked up valu-
able yardage on keepers and hit wing-
back Bruce Murphy with a 15-yard
pass completion to bring the ball back
to the BC 15.

But Pitt was not to score without
the freshman’s hand. On a third and 6
from the 11, Dorsett got a first down on
sheer effort and desire. Dorsett weaved
his way through defenders’ arms before
coming down at the 5.

Daniels took it in from the 3. The
drive ate up eight minutes and 44 sec-

onds as Carson Long kicked his first of
four conversions.

The Majorites took advantage of
good field position early in the second
quarter to goon top 14-0. This six play,
42-yard drive was highlighted by a 12-
yard scissors play by Murphy, a nifty
10-yard prance by Daniels and
Dorsett’s ll-yard scoring romp.

Pitt got this chance after Boston
College star Mike Esposito had to punt
from his end zone. Just a_ minute prior,
Daniels had failed to score on a fourth
and 1 at the one.

Thirty—three seconds and two plays

later, BC stunned Pitt with a ﬂea ﬂick-
er that went for 86 yards. It was one of
the few times that the Pitt defense was
pierced. The fact that BC tried fancy
stuff so early in the game is in itself a
great tribute to the ‘defenders.

Marangi ﬂung a toss to wide
receiver Dave Zumbach, who threw the
bomb to Mel Briggs behind safety
Dave Moorehead.

Briggs was caught at the one and
Esposito brought it in from there. Fred
Steinfort converted and the 23,219 fans
in attendance sensed a comeback.

A gutty and highly controversial
call by Majors put an end to that.

With the ball at the BC one, Majors
chose to go for the touchdown instead
of the field goal.

With three seconds left in the half,
Daniels scampered around the right
end. Long converted and the Cats had a
cushion.

. Defensive coordinator Jackie
Sherrill’s troops took up the fight in the

second half. The BC offense only.

crossed Pitt territory three times.

Marangi was ineffective and Esposito
was held to 58 yards on the ground.

The BC pass receivers had a lot to
do with Marangi’s ineffectiveness as
they dropped at least a half dozen pass-
es. However, freshman Bob Watts did
catch four for 52 yards.

BC linebacker‘Jim Coombs had a

tremendous effort for the Bostonians.’

Coombs had 22 individual tackles and
seven assists.

Dorsett scored his second TD of
the game with 2:02 left in the third
period. It was his eighth score of the
season and he leads the team in scor-
ing. V '
Joe Yucika’s troops ‘had one last
hurrah with five minutes to go, scoring

in three plays. Marangi hit Watts with a,

26—yarder in the corner of the end zone
for the last score.

Earlier in the week, head coach
Walt Harris named him the starter for
the rest of the season.

Against Syracuse, the BC sec-

interceptionreturn for a touchdown
by cornerback Lenny Walls.

Latef Grim will need to step it up
a notch, as he had just 36 receiving
yards against Syracuse.

Grim has inched closer to a
career milestone, needing just five
catches against the Eagles to pass
Dietrich Jells into first place on the
Panthers’ all-time receptions list
with 161. .

Quarterback Tim Hasselbeck
heads the BC offense.

Hasselbeck is a smart _quarter—
back and ranks third in the Big East
in passing yards.

Hasselbeck has a quick release,
and an experienced offensive line.

The line, .which includes four
seniors,.did not give up a sack versus
Virginia Tech or Syracuse.

Hasselbeck’s two best options
are wide receivers Dedrick Dewalt
and Jamal Burke. /\ A

_ Dewalt is the more dangerous of
the two, with more receptions and
more receiving yards.

Pitt’s last win in the series came

‘ in 1996, a 20-13 win at Pitt Stadium

on a Thursday night, and the all-time
series is tied at 12-12. 1

Panthers’ women’s tennis team has
improved from 12th to 10th place.
With the addition of the Hokies,
head coach George Dieffenbach will
have a tougher time making the post-
season tournament.
The new system only allows the

‘ top six tennis teams to make the tour-

nament. This is a dramatic change
from last year when all twelve teams
in the Big East were able to compete.

For Pitt,'making the jump from
l0th.to sixth place will be tough and
it will take away a possible trip to

Miami,_ where the women’s tennis

tournament is held. . ..

Woman’s Basketball

Bringing Virginia Tech into the
Big East means that 14 basketball
teams will compete in the confer-
ence. Out of these 14, only 12 will go

‘to the ‘Big East tournament in the
' spring. .

Last year, all 13 Big" East
women’s teams_ went to the tourna-
ment that tookplace at the University
of Connecticut. . ‘ Pitt women’s
basketball coach Traci Waites isn’t
too excited about Virginia Tech and
the new Big East tournament require-
ments. ’

“If they asked me, I would have
said no [to letting Virginia Tech enter‘
the conference] because then, we

would all go to the tournament,”

Waites said. “There are positives and
negatives. It depends on-how you
look at it. v n_ .

“It makes everyone play harder.

iWe’ve got to work harder. Virginia
pTech is very tough and has‘ a good A

team.”

Men’s basketball :
After a tough 11th place finish in

the Big East conference, Pitt is look-
‘ing to place a little higher this year.
.However, this year Pitt can’t finish

worse than seventh.

Men’s basketball has gone ,
through a major schedule and stand-
ings change.

-Georgetown, Notre Dame, Rutgers,

Just like the women, 12 teams
will make the Big East tournament,
but the teams will come from two dif-
ferent Big East divisions. Each Big
East division will have seven teams.
Six of those seven teams will make
the tournament at Madison Square
Garden in New York in the spring.

In the regular season, each school
will play two games against every
division opponent, as well as four
games against teams from the other
division. ' .

- Division A ‘will feature Boston
College, Virginia Tech, Villanova, St.
John’s, Providence, Miami and
Connecticut.

Joining Pitt in Division B will be

Seton Hall, Syracuse and West
Virginia. d
