Students alerted to “passive smoking”

By Bonnie Kartzman
For The _Pitt News

Passive smoking might be better
described as “a way to kill your rela-
tives,” claimed Dr. Lewis H. Kuller,
chairman of Pitt’s department of
Epidemiology, in his lecture entitled
“Health Risks of Exposure to Pas-
sive Smoking.” '

Last Thursday, Kuller and Dr.
Ken Svendsen from the University
of Minnesota made a joint attempt
to alert the public that smoking is
not only hazardous for those who do
it, but extremely dangerous for
those merely exposed to it as well.

According to Kuller, the largest
and longest subjection to passive
smoking is found at home and at

- work. “An eight-hour work shift in a

smoking environment might be
equal to as much as two-and-a-half
cigarettes per workshift for those
exposed,” he revealed. Critical fac-
tors also seemed to include the size

-of the work space, the number of

people in it and the amount of venti-
lation provided.

Kuller said he felt that the promi-
nent personal danger of passive
smoking is its effect in the house-
hold. He pointed out thatthere is as
much as a two-fold excess risk of
lung cancer in women whose hus-
bands are smokers. In comparison,

Svendsen disclosed (from a study he
had recently conducted) that the
average weight and average number
of drinks per week are both higher
for men with smoking wives.
Kuller also warned about the dis-
ease risks found in children sub-
jected to parental smoking. “There is
a cancer risk involved,” he said, “as
well as a slower rate of growth and
respiratory disease." He said that “if
a pregnant mother smokes, one can
find nicotine in the amniotic ﬂuid.”

He added that even the‘ fetus is a '

victim of ‘passive smoking. P, j

_ I
.,...

Kuller explained that smoking
consists of both quantitative as well
as qualitative factors — in other
words, the amount of smoke expo-
sure and the make-up of that smoke.
He indicated that there are actually
two kinds of smoke: mainstream,
inhaled by the smoker himself, and
sidestream, emitted from the burn-
ing end of the cigarette.

“Sidestream is a very different
kind of smoke,” emphasized Kuller.
“It is more concentrated and con-
tains more potent carcinogens.”

, He said thatadults who are non- .

smokers may have already been
exposed to many years of these car-
cinogens due to smoking in the
home by their parents as they were
growing up.

In addition to the physical issue of
passive smoking there has emerged a
legal one as well. According to
Kuller, many suits related to passive
smoking are flooding the
courtrooms.

He suggested as a solution that if

Sm0kiI1ﬁitS61fi§ 110‘ restricted, then r ested in these informative sessions..;

the facility where it is permittted
should have a sign indicating the
dangers of exposure. He said he feels
it should be posted conspicuously -
something similar to the warnings
found on cigarette packages.

Kuller also responded to the issue
of individuals who felt they had a

right to smoke. He indicated that ,

.1‘

just as important is the “person who ”

doesn't smoke and has a right not to

be exposed to the production of _

carcinogens.”

Further, Kuller conceded that‘-

although people exposed to passive

smoking don’t receive anywhere

near the amount of exposure as
actual smokers, they do involuntar-
ily receive some, an amount equival-
ent to one cigarette a day.

Following Kuller was Dr. Ray-.
mond Seltser, dean of the Graduate '
School of Public Health, who criti-.

cized the lack of attention given to
smoking as a major health problem.
“Smoking is an overwhelming prob-
lem,” he emphasized, “and yet peo-
ple don't take it as seriously as they
would pollution or a toxic dump.”

Thursday’s lecture was just one of
manygsponsored by the Graduate
School of Public Health’ in a series
called “Grand Rounds.” There are

‘United Press lntemational

Beirut — The militant group
Islamic Jihad contacted western
news agencies yesterday saying that

, it plans to set up a news conference
and present a number of the eight
hostages they continue to hold. As
of yesterday, no specific location or
time had been established for the
possible conference. Six of . the
hostages are U.S. citizens, the other‘
two are French.

The anonymous phone caller told
news agencies in Beirut that the pur-
pose of the news conference would
be to inﬂuence public opinion and
communicate direct messages to the
Reagan Administration.

Peggy Anderson, whose brother
Terry is among the hostages, criti-
cized the U.S. policy of refusing to
negotiate with the kidnappers.
Secretary of State Schultz reiterated
the administration's policy yester-
day on NBC-TV, which Anderson
described as “more than a little
stupid.”

The group, Islamic Jihad, has also
apparently given the United States a
deadline for arranging the release of
17 prisoners in Kuwait. The phone
caller said that hostage Benjamin
Weir, who was released earlier this
month, was to have delivered that
message to President Reagan per-
sonally. Weir did exchange words

privately with President Reagan
upon his return to the United States.

Violence spreads
in South Africa

South Africa —— Violence con-
tinues to spread in South Africa as
the country enters its llth week of
state-of-emergency rule. Five blacks
were killed in‘ interracial conflicts
yesterday after being accused of col-
laboration with the government.
Two of the victims were burned to
death and three were stabbed. Two
white soldiers were also wounded in

conflicts yesterday and another.

injured when a firebomb was thrown
into a patrolling armored troop
carrier.

Six other deaths and twelve injur-
ies have been attributed to fighting
between Zulu warriors and anti-
monarchist youths near Durban.
The youths accused the Zulu monar-
chists of cooperating with the white
government.

Professor Jakes Gerwel of the
Colored University of the Western
Cape in South Africa said the white-
minority government seems “totally
incapable of restoring peace to
society.” He warned that South

Africa could come to resemble

His comments came after police shot
and killed another black man late
last week.

Nearly 100 business leaders in
South Africa yesterday called for an
end to apartheid. The businessmen
placed full-page ads in newspapers
urging negotiations between the
white minority government and rec-
ognized black leaders.

despite the beginning of reconstruc-

The official beginning of recon-

over whether rescue efforts should
proceed on a large scale. American
and Israeli volunteers insist there is
still a chance of saving victims alive

volunteers have complained that
rescue efforts have been poorly

Pitt prof fights for “what is right,”
protests apartheid in South Africa

By Bobby Smouse
Staff Writer

Only the last name of the dead
man is remembered, but the psycho-
logical scars inflicted by his death
remain.

During the early I950s, steel was
the major industry in Pittsburgh,
and soot was more commonly
breathed than air. The Steelers and
the Pirates played their games at
Forbes Field. An extremely power-
ful man by the name of David Law-
rence controlled the city from the
mayor’s office. And the brutal
murder of a black‘ man named
Spalding wasreported simply as a
mere suicide.

Black journalist Malvin Goode
believed that Spalding was mur-

. dered, and he sought the truth. His

persistence and dedication to the
quest ‘seemed to inspire many,
including Dr. Jake Milliones, a teen-
ager at the time. _

“Spalding had been’ accused of
shooting a policeman_ and was
placed in the Allegheny County
jail,” Milliones remembers. “The
next morning he was found beaten
and hanged. The police said it was
suicide, but Goode knew better. I
can remember taking on David
Lawrence single-handedly. The
police tried to intimidate him, but he
would not stop- He was ﬁghting for
what he thought was right, and if
yiciu were to ask me who I respect the
most, it would be Malvin Goode.
People like Martin Luther King Jr.
and Malcolm X certainly had an
impact on me, but it was Goode who
inspired me,” said Milliones. ’

Today, Milliones is an assistant
professor of psychology and psychi-
atry at the University of Pittsburgh,
the president of the Pittsburgh
School Board and the chairman of
Pittsburghers against Apartheid. He
is the father of four and is: married to

Barbara‘ Sizemore. He is"-also‘one of

Pittsburgh’s most celebrated politi-
cal activists.

Milliones said that people like
Goode have greatly inspired him to
fight for what he thinks is right. Last
year Milliones, along with several
other protestors, was arrested by
Pittsburgh City Police and charged
with creating a public nuisance. The
protest was directed at three coin
shops in downtown Pittsburgh
which, at the time, sold South Afri-
can Kruggerrands, and the protest
was an effort to bring to light the
reportedly inhumane policies of the
apartheid government in South
Africa. ,

“I think our protest very definitely
had an impact. We were able to get
the three Pittsburgh dealers to dis-

‘lieu,

V ,

t./“--7

continue their sale of the Krugger-
rand, and we got divestment
legislation passed on a local basis,"
said Milliones. “As for my arrest, I
do not think that it left a negative
impression on my colleagues. They
certainly did not censure me for it.”

Milliones said he used to fight a
lot in school as a child. “I lived in a
predominately white section of
Pittsburgh then, and I attended a
school of mostly whites. When I
would hear the white kids singing
Steven Foster songs, with their ‘old
darky this’ and ‘old darky that,’ I
would be insulted. The only way I

knew how to stand up for what I .
thought was right was to use my

fists,” he said.

On Sept. 9th, President Ronald
Reagan did an about-face regarding
his policies toward South Africa
when he imposed economic sanc-
tions against that country. But for
many Americans, including Milli-
ones, the sanctions imposed were‘
seen simply as a way for Reagan to
avoid the issue.

“I really do not believe that Presi-
dent Reagan cares if 22 million
South Africans are oppressed,” said
Milliones. “I would like to see sanc-
tions that discontinue the exchange

between America and South Africa V

of nuclear technology and a stronger
monitoring of the computerltechnol-.
ogy that is exchanged. There should
be an immediate ban on the South
African Kruggerrand, and certainly
some strict sanctions relative to di-
vestment should be imposed.

“I think that if there had been dis-
coveredthat many whites had been
slaughtered in Poland, there would
have been an uproar in this coun-
try,” he continued. “However, I do

4 believe that the people of this coun- .

try are sympathetic to the situation
in South Africa. It is the government
which has the. stagnant ~ policy
toward South Africa. In other

‘words, there is more p,eople—suppo;rt
of anti—apartheid, than there is,‘

Ronald Reagan support."

Ever since the days of his child-
hood when he was first subjected to
racism, Milliones has fought for
what he thought was right. “I would
hope that someday I will have
inspired someone, like Malvin
Goode inspired. me, to stand up for
what is right. I'm not saying that
they have to do it in a sort of righte-
ous way, but there are certain things
that must be done if you are to feel
complete as a person.”

Arms Race

After receiving a bold and surprising letter from Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev calling for a 50 percent reduction
in the offensive nuclear arsenals of both the United States and
the Soviet Union, the Reagan administration has, according to
the Sunday, Sept. 29th edition of The New York Times, held
its arms open to “tough but fair” negotiations with the Soviets,

providing, of course, that its final proposal “will be free of

preconditions and other obstacles to progress.”

In his weekly radio address, Reagan said,“There is no reason
why real reductions cannot begin promptly.” While statements
like this sound overtly optimistic and even promising, it is hard
at this point to accept it as anything but hollow face-saving

rhetoric. This is, remember, an administration which has again

and again refused to put any substantial bargaining chips on
the table in Geneva, especially in regard t_o the beloved “Stars
Wars” program.

- It appears that this move by the Soviets is more than an
attempt to discredit the Reagan administration in front of its
allies in Western Europe and the American public. Although _it
should be approached cautiously, there can be no doubt that.
this is as good, a time as any for the United States to take an

active and positive role in reducing the threat of nuclear and .

space warfare.

If the president hopes, as he says, to make any real progress
in this area and gain credibility for the United States in its
foreign policy, he must now, while in the international'spot-
light, follow up on the Soviet’s proposal and take charge of

, future negotiations. It is time for the president to practice what

he preaches and take the initiative, to set examples and lead the
world into a, nuclear-free future.

Is this a realistic stance? Perhaps the administration’s rhe-
toric is simply a smoke screen for larger economic concerns.
We hope differently.

MTV Beneﬁt

Well, here’s your chance to get it!
You can bring MTV to Pitt! Music
Television (MTV) has created The
Rock Alike. The Rock Alike is a new
fund-raising lip-synch contest that
offers the chance to bring MTV to
our campus. And not on your televi-
sion screen, either. This will be a live
MTV concert broadcast from Pitt.

How will all of this happen? MTV
will broadcast a concert from the
campus of the university that raises
the most money for Multiple Sclero-
sis. The fund-raising event will cen-
ter around The Rock Alike, a
lip-synch contest in which you, the
students, will impersonate your
favorite rock stars. And Pitt, as a
campus, will be competing against
150 other colleges and universities
from all over the United States,
including such schools as the Uni-
versity of Hawaii, UCLA, WVU and
Penn State. Also, the student who is
the winner of the national Rock
Alike finals will win an internship at
MTV.

This event will benefit the local
and national Multiple Sclerosis
societies. MS is a major disabling
disease that most often strikes peo-
ple in our age group. The cause and
cure of MS are unknown.

You can be part of this new
nationwide event. It is being spon-
sored by your Resident Student
Association. There will be a general
meeting for everyone interested on
Oct. 2 at 8 p.m. in the Tower A
Conference Room. If you have any
questions or comments, you can
contact RSA at x4098. Stop by
Wednesday if you want your MTV!

Woes At Trees

In reference to “Boxer Shorts,"
(Sept. 23) I felt compelled to make a
few comments.

I agreed with all of Mr. Picone’s
comments, with one exception. Lux
et Veritas does not stand for Truth
and Luxury; it stands for Truth and
Light, and I believe that the type of
light this refers to is ﬂuorescent
light, although it could be softglow,
what this has to do with education I
will never know.

And now, a few original com-
ments. I recently_had the unfortu-
nate experience of visiting Trees
Hall, the recreational facility. First,

at the main desk, who when asked a
simple question such as “Is the'Pool

obstacle, you are faced with the
locker room. The first thing one
notices upon entering the locker

room is a prominent sign reading, V

“Do not place valuables in Lockers.”

So you attempt to place them with
the attendant behind the desk. You
are told that it is not the practice of
the attendants to keep valuables (I
believe that the purpose of the
attendants is to say, “Hey boy, don’t
put your valuables in that there
locker," and nothing else, aside from
watching their mini television sets).
No wonder the lock was stolen off of
my locker in a record five seconds.
Perhaps this is all a ploy to enrage
someone so that they will work out
harder, thus getting maximum
benefit from the equipment.

Keep The Faith

Kevin Bold embarrasses students
everywhere with his sophomoric cri-
tiaue of faith and reason in the Mon-
day, Sept. 24 issue of The Pitt News.
Telling the head of the university’s
Chaplain’s Association to change
his occupation because he is a man
of faith shows that Mr. Bold (an
Information Science/ Library
Science student) has had his head up
his Macintosh for far too long and
badly needs a dose of theological
training by someone other than Ayn
Rand.

The things that reason will never
provide include wisdom and guid-
ance. It might be logical to blow two
Japanese cities off the face of the
planet to stop a war, but was it wise?
Do you sleep better at night? Reason
might dictate that oceans of nuclear

missiles provide us with security, but _

do you really think that's what each
of us needs? Yet science and logic
and reason have led us to believe
that this is what we should do.

Do you really believe that science
cares about the poor? With each
tick-tock of the clock one person
dies somewhere in this world from
malnutrition. Where are your scien-
tists? Where is your reason? Where
the hell is Ayn Rand, save for sitting
in her penthouse telling us, “I care
only for my pleasure.“

I think that Mr. Bold confuses
ideology with reason. He says that
the price of education has gone up
with increased demand allegedly
brought on by increased gove.rn-
ment subsidization. I smell a Liber-
tarian here. Pitt would close in a
minute without government help,
and you’d be studying computers in
a matchbook correspondence
course without it.

And, by the way, Mr. Bold, have
you ever savored thejoys of reading

Doestoyevsky, Carl Jung,
hoeffer, Descartes, Leibmtz many
of a thousand other great philos-

ophers and writers who happen to be.

religious men? Ever read the reli-
gious writings of Einstein? A’ny
schmuck can read Fortran, Cobol
and Basic. We teach them in high
school now. Why put faith in such
dime store theoreticians as Rand?

Tell Ghandi to find another pro-
fession. Or Martin Luther King. Or
Pope John Paul. Or- even Khomeni.
I suggest that their power and
knowledge will do more to change
the world than any computer or pulp
philosopher ever will. '

Far Right

This is not the best of all possible
worlds.
exist as a daily occurrence for many
people. Many of us on the left and in
the middle of the political spectrum
have organized to protest U.S. sup-
port for these actions in South
Africa and Central America. Public
opinion polls report huge majorities
of people agreeing with specific
goals dealing with these areas, for
example supporting sanctions
against the South African govern-
ment counterattack on these beliefs
held by Americans, with national
figures like Ronald Reagan, Jesse
Helms and Jerry Falwell at the
forefront.

Simply Speaking/ Michael Ashford  

Housing Problems At Pitt

While investigating students’
complaints over University Housing
Services for The Pitt News last
week, I was appalled by the magni-
tude of the problem and how poorly
it was being handled by university
authorities. In light of the fact that
new student admissions have been
rising steadily for three years now,
there is no visible explanation that
the university can present at this
time to account forits neglect. Any
administrator with a claim to even
average managerial skills would
have seen the problem approaching,
and developed a sound short-term
and long-term strategy _to compen-
sate for the growth in housing
demand. .

Instead, constantly changing
application cut-off dates, make‘-shift
lottery systems, fantastical waiting
lists and letters of intimidation are
the only “plan” housing authorities
could produce. The consequences
reach far beyond the inconvenience
of temporary housing in "dormitory
lounges; there are substantial costs
to both students and the university
which remain unaccounted for.

For example, the Student
Accounts Office confirms the rumor
that many students decide to go to a
university other than Pitt not
because they couldn’t be guaranteed
freshman housing (which, in my
opinion, any reputable university
does), but simply because they were
not given any definite response to
housing requests until very late in
the summer.

It is obvious that the housing

authorities are thereby clinging to
the excess demand with the intent of
profiting from students‘ needs. The
ensuing lotteries and waiting lists
ensure the university that every
available unit, including the ad-hoc
lounge rooms, will be filled to capac-
ity. This “strategy” benefits the uni-
versity greatly yet does not even
approach allaying the _ominous
demand/supply imbalance. More
importantly, it‘causes many students
to suffer, both psychologically and
in practical terms, the insecurity of
not knowing where they will live as
the fall term nears. It surely comes as
a great relief to administrators when
panicking students rush madly into
the off-campus housing market
come July and August. I voluntarily
abstain from recounting the horror
stories which even that has
produced.
In another “strategic” move this
spring, many new students received
a letter containing petty excuses and
cheap psychological intimidations
to discourage on-campus housing
demand, The letter began, “Eve-
ryone wants to be popular  Unfor-
tunately, popularity has its
drawbacks!” and went on to say that
cut-off dates had been moved up
from the original May I deadline.
After stating the sudden change in
policy, the letter takes on a child-like
quality with the words, “ALL
AVAILABLE INFORMATION
. FROM THE ADMISSIONS
AREA HAS STRESSED THAT
HOUSING ON CAMPUS IS NOT
GUARANTEED AND IS ON A

‘FIRST COME, FIRST SERVED’
BASIS.” This sentence is particu-

larly revealing insofar as the housing ,

authority is reflexively taking
recourse to stagnant policies in
defense of blatant mismanagement.
The unimaginative impulse of uni-
maginative administrators? It is a
classic behavior.

There are many alternatives the
housing authority could have

— pursued, but it seems that action will

come t.oo late and only as the prob-
lem reaches uncontrollable propor-
tions. For example, new on-campus
housing qualification prerequisites
could have been established long
ago (e.g., restricting on-campus
housing to non-city state residents).
Also, units allotted to returning stu-
dents could have been cut back after

. informing them that housing was

not available for the next term,
instead of creating a lottery system.
Thus, while still on campus, these
students could have made off-
campus housing arrangements for
the coming fall. ‘

If administrators reading this letter
are sufficiently incensed by now and
accusing me of making unfeasible
suggestions, I retort by saying, “Of
course‘they’re unfeasible — I'm not

being paid $30 thousand a year to '

produce them — you are.” Never-
theless, the administration will now
have to deal with an inevitable ons-
laught of uninformed proposals
from unqualified people as discont-
ent grows. The forthcoming instabil-
ity is a product of their own poor
performance.

The Virtues Of Solitudeln A Hectic World  

— SOLITU DE -

When from our better selves we have
too long
Been parted by the hurrying world.
and droop.
Sick of its business, of its pleasures
tired,
How gracious, how benign, is Soli-
tude.
—— William Wordsworth
My column in the Sept. 13 editor-
ial page about teachers at Pitt who
cannot teach has caused quite a stir
among Pitt News readers. Reactions
among the faculty ranged from “I’m
glad some students are taking
actions towards their problems,” to
“Does the University of Pittsburgh
need this adverse publicity?” Stu-
dents and friends, on the other hand,
have prbclaimed me a messiah for
those suffering from non-English
speaking T.A.s and jargon-
mumbling professors.
Unfortunately, you know what
happened to the last great messiah.
With criticism filling my head
with all sorts of viewpoints, I needed

to escape and think things out. I
retreated into solitude.
Let's talk about solitude.
That inward eye
Which is the bliss of solitude.
-— William Wordsworth
When I realized I needed to sort
out all the flack I'd been receiving
over my article, I took a walk down
to Schenley Park. I wandered along
a dirt path no one else was hiking,
gazing at the blue sky through the
leaves and branches of the woods,
until ‘I came to an old stone bridge
covered with ivy and brittle weeds. I
sat down on the stonework, sur-
rounded by the solitude, and let
thoughts tumble through my head.
The opinions and the facts about the
controversy slowly came into one
complete perspective as I pondered
them, and a few ideas for rebuttal to
the criticism suddenly came into
mind. A few hours later, I returned
to my dorm with an idea of what was
going on in the minds of my critics
and the actions I would take to
appease my supporters — insight
brought about by a few moments

solitude.
When I read the newspaper or

listen to friends tell me about what is,

going on in their lives, I can’t help
but feel there’s a crisis in the lack of
insight. People 'say the stupidest
things, you might put it, and there is
too much stupidity in this world
because individuals holding respon-
sibility do not take the time to really
think about things — life’s big deci-
sions decided in short bursts of time
and thought without weighing all
the facts or determining the implica-
tions. These people need to spend
time in solitude.

Sometimes I wonder. Has Posvar
spent a few hours by himself think-
ing about the consequences of his
university budgeting policies? Why
can’t Reagan spend a few hours
thinking realistically about spending
a trillion dollars on his Strategic
Defense Initiative? (Although he
probably does spend time in solitude
out at his California ranch on horse-
back. What does he think of, then?)
Why can’t the members ofthe Soviet
Politburo and the U.S. Congress

step back from their bureaucracies '

and reflect on the reasons their rela-
tions have been so sour over the past
four decades, and what can be realis-
tically accomplished to resolve
unfounded disagreements? Why
can’t one of my friends step back and
see how putting off his studies until
the night before the final will lead
him to never learn the material pro-
vided in a subject from which he
hopes to get ajob? Why doesn't a girl
see how her boyfriend abuses her,
when her friends see it as so obvious?

All suffer, in my mind, from a lack
of having the big picture. You do not
buy this painting in an art gallery.
You obtain it from gathering facts
and impressions and, like a jigsaw
puzzle, by putting the pieces
together. You have to think things
out" in peace. You have to put the
puzzle together in solitude.

Henry David Thoreau had the
right idea, spending months in isola-
tion along the banks of Walden
Pond in Massachusetts. Despite the
highway that runs just beyond the
trees and the hundreds of visitors

wandering the lake's shore with you,
solitude can still be found in those
woods. You become calm, you can
listen to the thoughts in your head.
you can see the big picture. So did
Thoreau, who painted his philoso-
phical thoughts in “Walden,”
including: “I never found the com-
panion that was so companionable
as solitude. We are for the most part
more lonely when we go abroad
among men than when we stay in
our chambers. A man thinking or
working is always alone, let him be
where he will.”

Have something on your mind?
Have you lost.touch with yourself?
Seek out solitude. Then let your
mind drift. Reflect. Try to attain
understanding. The world seems'to
need so much of, it.

When you shut your doors, and
darkened your room, remember
never to say that you are alone, for
you are not alone; but Godis within.
and your genius is within —- and
what need have they of light to see
what you are doing?

Propogandists like Norman Pod-

“authoritarian” and excusable. Only
someone living in the far-right fan-
tasy world would require a discus-
sion of repression to focus first and
last on one nation, but that is what
comes out of Washington.

It is absurd to anyone remotely
familiar with the literature on the
left to claim we ignore actions in
Eastern Europe, Russia or Nicara-

gua. It is true that in protests on
American policy we don’t always
add the disclaimer “but things are
bad in Russia, too.” It is not only
ridiculous to require this rhetoric,
but completely beside the point. The
purpose of such organized protest is
to change the policy of this govern-
ment, not to engage in some dema-
gogic fervor over the “evil empire.”
But the far right accuses anyone who
doesn't to be fellow travellers with a

Prof urges terrorism policy

-By Mary Fratis
For’The Pitt News

In recent years, the United States
has become a major target of terror-
ism throughout the world. Car
bombings and kidnappings are fre-
quently threatening U.S. security
and creating a feeling of vulnerabil-
ity and helplessness in the American
people.

According to Pitt professor Dr.
Donald Goldstein, the average atti-
tude _is that “you can’t do anything
about it, so you just sit back and
watch it.”

Goldstein defines terrorism as “an
illegal attack used to take the people
in power and force them to change
their minds.” He said he sees terror-
ism as a drastic intercultural prob-
lem which can only be deterred by
initial prevention.

“The average attitude is
that you can ’t do anything
about it, so you just sit
back and watch it”

Dr. Donald Goldstein

“As of"right now,” Goldstein said,
“there is no action, only reaction.”

Until now, Goldstein said, the
United States has been unable to
deal effectively with terrorism
because they lack a solid policy
against it. He said a policy should be
adopted which would be applicable
to all situations and “muststress
prevention." He added, however,
that much care should be used in
developing a strategy — too many

plans have previously created more
problems than they have helped.

As a preventive measure, Gold-
stein suggested that the government
utilize the. Central Intelligence
Agency. He said that agents could
infiltrate a terrorist group and gain
information which could be used to
warn targets of terrorism. He also
suggested that crisis negotiations
should take place but in a more pri-
vate atmosphere.

“Traveling at your own risk” is
another possible solution, he said.
The statement could be printed on
all passports, and the crews on those
planes that are used to combat ter-
rorists should be highly trained.

Goldstein also pointed out that a
policy should be made which uses
the media as a base formula for all
terrorist attacks which will not
endanger U.S. citizens involved in
such a situation.

all-night studying

By Michael Ashford
Staff Writer

After voicing their pleasure and
gratitude to Mr. and Mrs. Posvar
for attending a presidential recep-
tion on Thursday evening, the Stu-
dent Government Board reviewed
several issues of direct relevance to
student life this semester.

Peter Petropoulos, a board
member, expressed his discontent
with the board's procedures. Appar-
ently, allocations requests are being
presented for board approval with-
out sufficient time for discussion.

One request that the Allocations
Committee advised should be
refused was tabled for further review
at Petropoulos’ insistence. The
request concerned funds for bring-
ing a speaker from the Simon Liese-
thal- Center to the university.
Payment for the speaker would go
directly to the Center, a non-profit,
charitable organization, thereby
violating allocation codes.

Among the issues reviewed was
the acquisition of an all-night study
facility for students during the pre-
finals reading period. Board
member Daniel Taylor said that “it

looks optimistic for this term.” The
main obstacle at this point is provid-
ing adequate security services for the
facility. A location has not yet been
determined, but several spots are
under consideration.

The board also approved plans to
bring county voting machines on
campus for this fall’s student
government elections. The machines
hopefully will increase student vot-

_ing participation by simplifying the

process. Also, election results will be
tallied more quickly with the
machines. In addition, the machines
cost less than the price of employ-
ment of individuals to tally the votes
manually.

In a related issue, election rules
have been amended by the board.

Until this year, there have been no .

rules regarding recount procedures,
should an election result be con-
tested. This created some instability
last year when Luke Kluchko’s vic-
tory was contested by his opponent.

Under the new rules, a marginal
difference of 2 percent or less justi-
ﬁes contestation and recount. The
appeal for recount must now also be
made within three working days of
the election’s end.

Panama leader
gives resignation

Panama — President Nicholas
Ardito Barletta resigned on Satur-
day in the face of growing criticism
for his economic policies. He has
been succeeded by his vice president,
who is calling on the country to unite
and to preserve the democratic insti-
tutions of Panama which only
recently had been secured. Barletta
resigned saying he could no longer
rely on the nation's political parties
and military for support in leading
the country out of financial crisis.
Panama faces a growing $3.7 billion
debt. Barletta had proposed an eco-
nomic plan of austerity which met
with strong resistance from both the
armed forces ——- a significant politi-
cal force in Panama — and from
opposition parties.

Resume seen as “bestselling tool’

By Susan Washbum
For The Pitt News

A resume is the “best selling
tool you can make for yourself,”
said Joann Rose of the Voca-
tional Rehabilitation Center.
She said the purpose ofa resume
is to “entice the person to call you
for an interview.” To achieve
this, she offers several guidelines.

First, Rose emphasized the
importance of having more than
one resume. She suggests that
job seekers use a different resume
,for each job application.

1 Also, one must decide whether
to use a chronological or func-
tional resume. A chronological
resume is simply a listing of pre-
vious jobs — beginning with the
most recent. A functional resume
lists interests and acquired skills
as well as job experience.

“Past work records determine
which type of resume to use,"

Also, one must decide
whether to use a chrono-
logical or functional
resume. A chronological
resume is simply a listing
of previous jobs, —
beginning with the most

recent. -
A functional resume lists

interests and acquired
skills as well as job
experience

Rose said. “A person with a con-
sistent work record should use a '
chronological resume. A person
changing careers or entering the
work force should opt for the
functional style,” she said.

There are several facts that

must be included regardless of
the type of resume being used.
These include the following:
0Name, address, and telephone
number

0Career objectives — whatjob is
being sought

0Education

0Experience

Keferences may be included.
However, Rose suggests that ref-
erences be made available upon
request. This is to avoid ﬂooding
the reference with calls and
letters.

tor are length (a resume should
not exceed two pages), technical
elements (spelling and grammar)
and the presence of a cover letter.

The cover letter explains what
position is being sought, job
goals and how the individual
would benefit the company.

Morgantown — West Virginia
used four Pitt turnovers and two
missed Mark Brasco field goals
on Saturday to forge a 10-10 tie
in the 78th meeting between the
Mountaineers and Pitt at Moun-
taineer Field. 3

West Virginia quarterback I
Tony Reda, a native of nearby
Mt. Lebanon, took the ball over '
from one yard out with 4:38 left

.in the game and Charlie Bau-
mann’s extra point attempt knot-
ted the score at the 10-10 ﬁnal.

“Well, I guess a tie_ is worse
than kissing your sister, espe-
cially the way it was done out
there tpday,” said Pitt head
coach F'oge Fazio' following the
game. “It must not have been a
very pretty football game to
watch, especially the second half.
It wasn’t very pretty at all."

It was the second half that
proved to be Pitt’s downfall, but
the first half was not all that
impressive either. The Panthers
led 10-0 at the half thanks to a
20-yard field goal’ by Brasco
early in the second quarter and a
one-yard touchdown sneak by
quarterback John Congemi later
in the quarter.

_ Pitt had the ball six times in
the first half. The first two drives
ended with Bill Rudison punts.
The other four were ' divided
between the scoring drives and
two center-quarterback
exchange fumbles deep in West .
Virginia territory.

Pitt receiver Chuck Scales looks upfield after one of his seven receptions.

“We just didn’t get. the
exchange,” said Congemi.
“whetheriit was -my fault or Bar-
ry's (center Barry Pettyjohn)
fault, I don't know. I just didn’t
get the ball.” ’ *

The fumbles overshadowed
Pitt’s total domination in the
first half, especially in the second
quarter when, of the 43 total
plays run by both teams, only
‘five were in Pitt territory. At the
half, Pitt. had 200 yards in

 

offense, ‘West Virginia had 84.
That trend would get stronger as
the game progressed.

Pitt seemed in good shape,
with a 10-0 lead and the ball as
the second half began, but on the
second play from scrimmage, the
Panthers coughed the ball up
again. This time the culprit was
senior Darnell Stone. West Vir-
ginia’s Travis Curtis recovered,"
and the Mountaineers had the
ball at Pitt’s 33-yard line. The

defense hung tough as it did all
day. Tailback John Holifield ran
for one yard, then Reda threw
incomplete. That set up third and

replaced starter John Talley in
the first half, dropped back and
looked right. When he looked
left again, Pitt defensive tackle
Walters Johnson was right in
front of him. Reda spun, but

As I see it

By Jim Brueckner

Pirates could draw fans without a winning record

"It is wonderful to be here, to be
able to hear the baseball against the
bat, ball against glove, and be able to
boo the umpire. " ,

—— General Douglas MacArthur

« It was June 19, I846. Therewere
18 grown men gathered around Ely-
sian Field in Hoboken, New Jersey,
taking part in a very odd game that
appeared to be more suited for
young children than adults. One of
the men would begin play by throw-
ing a little, white ball at another man
who would try to hit it with a long
tube-like stick. If he was successful
in striking the ball, he would run

‘around the field to various bags

placed in a square, while the other
men would give chase to the little,
white ball. One group of men, who
called themselves the New York
Nine, were declared the winners over

the other group, who called them-
selves the Knickerbockers, by a
score of 21-1. It was a most bizarre
event.

. But it sure was fun!

The game of baseball has always
been associated with fun and good
times. There is perhaps no form of
entertainment more American than
baseball. What better way to spend a
summer night than at a. major-
league game. It is our national past-
time, and one to be proud of.

"At the baseball match, we
encounter real democracy of spirit-
...Barriers are forgotten, and how
good it seems for us to be just human
beings.”

—— Reverend Roland D. Sawyer

I wonder if Alexander Cartwright .

PressBox

The Pitt Lady Panther
tennis team rebounded
from last week’s pro-
blems...see page 13

had any idea the impact he would
have on American culture when he
’ invented baseball way back in 1846.

He has piovided millions of hou-rs of

fun for-millions of Americans.

I think that it is a shame that Mr.
Cartwright"s game has attracted
such small crowds in Pittsburgh

lately. What happened to all those

fun- times?

' When someone questions the low
attendance at Pirate games in recent

years, heis usually given the instant
response that the Pirates are in last
place.

While this is the major reason, it is
far from the only reason. Baseball
has‘ proven over the years that it is
the one game that can be a fun ex-
perienqe for the fans even if their

team poses no threat

championship.

The women’s volley
ball team won it’s tenth
straight match over the

weekend...see page 14

Losing isn't the Pirates’ only
problem. ‘There are other minor
improvements that the stadium peo-
ple could make on the “game expe-
rience” that would bring in more
fans. They are little things, but I
think that after people come to just
one ‘game and experience them, it
would subconsciously bring them
back because they had a good time.

'One‘major problem is the con-
stant rise of ticket prices. If the
Pirates would continue to dump big
money veterans in favor of what has
so far proven to be a successful
youth movement, this could keep
the prices down. In a city like Pitts-
burgh which is suffering from high
unemployment, fans can’t afford_to

pay expensive ticket prices for 8| »

games.

Nehlan —
happy with
ﬁnal score

By Michael Bertonaschi
Staff Writer

West Virginia head coach Don
Nehlen walked into the press room
following" Saturday‘s game wearing
a shiny gold “Attitude” pin on the
lapel of his sport coat. The bright pin
seemed to reﬂect his own disposition
since the Mountaineers managed ‘to
overcome a 10-0 halftime deficit and
wind up with a 10-10 tie with Pitt.

“I feel like Ijust kissed my sister,
Carolyn,” said Nehlen, “and she’s
kinda nice. Nobody’s happy with a
tie, but on the other hand, we grew
up as a team. If you’d have seen us
last week, you’d be happy, too!”

The Mountaineers were beaten by
Maryland 28-0 last week, and for a
while on Saturday it looked as if
they would suffer yet another
embarrassing defeat. The Pitt
offense moved the ball at will and
sophomore quarterback John Tal-
ley could not get the West Virginia
running game moving.

Nehlen had decided earlier in the
week that if the ground game was
not working, then he would go with
senior Tony Reda of Mt. Lebanon at
quarterback but he, too, expe-
rienced difficulty moving the ball,
and Nehlen pointed to the defensive
changes made by Pitt. ’

“They jumped into man-to-man
coverage and gave everybody ‘big
plays, and I said it will be just our
luck against us they’ll get out of that
and play straight zone," he said.
“Had they played simple defenses
against other teams, I think it would
have ben a different story because
their defensive line-is so good.”

The game itself was not very good
in the first half. Both teams made
dozens of mistakes, and West Virgi-
nia was hit with nine penalties for.86
yards. Two of those were personal,
fouls which Nehlen blamed on blat-
ant intimidation tactics by Pitt. In
fact, at the end of the half he was
seen walking to. the locker room with
his arm around one of the officials.

* “I just felt that there was some- .

thing going on intentionally that I
didn’t like, and I was afraid that the

‘game was going to get out of hand,"

he said. “Pitt tried to intimidate one
guy‘[defensive back Travis Curtis]. I
know they did it, but I'm not sure
that’s what you want to do in a foot-
ball game."

Reda led West Virginia to a third-
quarter field goal, and then, with
under five minutes to go, he had
them first and goal at the Pitt four-
yard line. Three running plays put
the ball on the one, and on the fourth
down, Reda snuck over for the six
points.

However, Pitt did not feel that
Reda crossed the plane of the goal
line on the fourth down. Said
Nehlen, “I have no idea, but I do
know that we scored twice before
that, but it didn't count. My fullback
said,‘l guarantee you I was in both
times.‘ So we scored two and maybe
didn't score once, so we got screwed
once." '

him down. It seemed as if John-
son grabbed him in the back of
the neck, but the officials dis-
agreed. Pitt got slapped with a
I5-yard facemasking penalty and
West Virginia got the ball, first
and I0, at the Pitt 35. Instead of
having to punt, West Virginia
ran four more plays, and that set
up Baumann for a 32-yard ﬁeld

‘goal.

‘‘I’m very upset withthe offi-
ciating," said Fazio. ‘‘I’m very,
very upset, and you can put that
in print.”

The officiating played a role in
Pitt's following drive. The
Panthers drove ‘right down the
field. Tailback A..B. Brown, who
rushed for .105 yards while filling
in for an injured Charles Glad-
man, ripped off a 38-yard run on
the first "play from scrimmage
following Baurnann’s field goal.

. Three plays later, Pitt got called

for holding. That backed them
up 10 yards and put the'Panthers
in a passing situation. On the
ensuing play, _Congemi was
sacked by tackle Brad Hunt fora
l3-yard loss. A 22-yard c_omple-
tion to Clint Wilson got the
Panthers close, but that was not
enough for a first down. Brasco
attempted a 46-yard ﬁeld goal,
but was short, and the score
remained I0-3.

“I think they should call penal-
ties,” said Fazio, referring to the
officiating. “They’ve liberalized
the use of the hands,” added
Fazio. “Now that they've liberal-
izpd it, they don’t know how to
interpret it.”

Brasco got another shot late in
the third quarter, but his 36-yard
attempt was wide right. It
marked the second game this
year that the highly touted kicker
from Jeannette could have been
the difference between winning
and losing for the Panthers.

“I wish I knew (what’s causing
Brasco‘s slump)," said Congemi,
who holds for Brasco. “I don’t

know what Mark is doing wrong.

If I knew, I would be the ﬁrst one
to sit down and talk with him.”
Congemi added, “Sometimes
when I’m not getting off to a
great start, it takes me a while to
get my confidence going. Mark
‘doesn’t have that chance. He has
a one-shot opportunity. He goes
out there, and he either makes it
or misses it.”

Following Brasco‘s second
miss, Pitt’s defense, which put
forth a banner effort, held. Pitt
got the ball with 2:01 on the
third-quarter clock. Following

 

 

two Brian Davis carries, Con-
gemi, who completed 18 of 27
passes for 209 yards, dropped
and rolled right after being
forced out of the pocket. The
senior from Lauderdale Lakes,
Fla., tried to throw back across
field to Wilson, but West Virgi-
nia cornerback Willie Edwards
was waiting for him. Edwards
intercepted and returned it to the
-Pitt 34-yard line. The Mountai-

' neers drove down and had the

ball first and goal at ‘the nine-
yard line. Pitt’s defense hung
tough.“ On fourth down at the
ﬁve-‘yard line, Reda threw into
the left ﬂat to tailback Torn
Gray. Pitt cornerback Ducky
Lewis put a hit on Gray and
forced the ball out of his hands,
incomplete.

Pitt took over at their own
five, but an illegal procedure
penalty backed Pitt up, and Pitt
was forced to punt. West Virgi-
nia took over at its own 43, and
drove down to Pitt’s 18-yard line
where it was fourth down and
two with just over five minutes
remaining in the game. West Vir-
ginia head coach Don Nehlen
opted to pass the ﬁeld goal
attempt and go for the first
down. Reda dropped and hit
tight end Gary Basil on an out
pattern. The play went for 14
yards, and West Virginia had the
ball, first and goal, at the four-
yard line. It took all ‘four plays,
but the Mountaineers finally
pushed it over. Reda ‘scored on a
quarterback keeper, Baumann
added the extrapoint, and the
scoring was ﬁnished.

Both teams had’ their chances
before the ﬁnal gun sounded, but

H neither could convert. The clos-

the game is when a Congemi pass
went through the outstretched
arms of receiver Dwayne Milloy

Although there was no winner

allowed Boston College last

West Virginia’s nationally

ick. Despite the beating on the
stat sheet, Nehlen was not all that

“I thought we grew up as a

back from a 10-0 deficit to tie a

Lady Panthers have

successful weekend

By Gregg Ficery
For The Pitt News

The University of Pittsburgh
women’s tennis team posted two satisf-
ying victories this weekend over
Duquesne and St. Francis at Trees’
courts, thus ending a three-match los-
ing streak. .

Leading the Lady Panthers’ 8-1 tri-
umph on Friday. against Duquesne
were Stephanie Nelson and Karen
‘Meade with straight set wins at No. 3

and No. 6 singles, respectively. Coach»

George Dieffenbach has been particu-
larly impressed with Nelson’s play this
fall.

“Stephanie is absolutely our» most
improved player,” Dieffenbach
emphasized. “She has really worked on
improving her backhand topspin over
the summer.”

This win is especially valuable to
Dieffenbach’s team because they were
able to win three out of four three-set

Pirates’ attendance problems

continued from page” 11

I was ecstatic when I went to my
ﬁrst Pirate game after the installa-
tion of the new scoreboard. I saw
great potential; I couldn’t wait to see
that potentialrealized. I'm still wait-
ing for this potential to develop.
Throughout the course of the game,
trivia questions are ﬂashed along
with four possible answers. This is
exactly the type of thing that base-
ball fans love. Baseball fans, more
than any other sports fans, thrive on
trivia. Why do we have only two or
tliree questions per game? And why
are they flashed while the game is in
progress? When these questions are
ﬂashed, they become the center of
attention and everyone around me
immediately engages in heated
debate over the correct answer. As I
said, I havenever met a baseball fan
who didn’t enjoy trivia. Why not
ﬂash trivia questions after each half-
inning? If I know baseball fans,
they'll probably keep score amongst
themselves.

I have never seen a more capti-
vated audience than when highlights
of Roberto Clemente’s career are
shown on the screen. Sometimes,
Clemente gets a louder ovation than
the game. Admittedly, no one has
the hold on the memories of Pirate
fans than “The Great One”does, but
why not show more highlights" of
other players? How about Babe
Ruth, Rogers Hornsby, Joe DiMag-

singles matches.

“Winning these matches. is really
special for the girls,” Dieffenbach
stated. “It’s the best experience for

them, also.”

The victory over St. Francis was
much more decisive at 9-0 with none of
the Lady Panthers so much as losing a

Set.

Coach Dieffenbach is hoping that
this will build a little momentum for his
team after dropping a 6-3 decision to
IU P earlier in the week and convincing
losses to rivals Penn State and Buck-
nell last week. The loss to IUP was
particularly disappointing, however, in
that the match was tied at 3-3 going

into doubles play.

Dieffenbach is relying on
six remaining dual matches to prepare
the squad for the rigorous competition
at the Big East Conference Tourna-
ment which will be held the weekend of

Oct. 26.

gio, Willie Mays, Ted Williams, Bob
Gibson or Jackie Robinson? How
much money can it cost to put
together a 30-second biography?
Not as much as the salary of an over-
paid player.

Baseball fans love ritual. How
about this? Once the third out is
made, a trivia question is ﬂashed.
While the fans are contemplating the
answer, a 30-second biography of
one of the all-time greats is shown.
At the film’s end, the question re-
appears, and 10 seconds later the
answer is given.

What I think is an absolute stroke
of genius is the video to “Charge.”
It’s hysterical. There is this black-
and-white film of soldiers “charg-
ing” over these muddy trenches in
the night. To make it even better, the
film is speeded up ridiculously fast.
I'd like to see it more often. There is
even a video entitled the “National
Anthem.” Let’s see more of this
creativity.

One new twist that would benefit
the Pirates, as well as please the fans,
would be the selling of nachos in the
stands. Seriously, we are talking big
bucks here. This is a very weird fad
that has Pittsburgh fans absolutely
crazy. I know people who have
stood in a line to buy nachos and
have literally missed three innings of
a ball game. This isn’t an argument
to put more people in the seats.
Selling nachos in the stands is just

WEEK u’?x‘f"."-is

 

one way of possibly ﬁnancing the -

above-mentioned biographies of
players that could be shown on the
big screen.

In trying to boost attendance, the
Pirates did try to improve the “Buc
Night” package. In addition to the

cut in ticket prices, they also
included one dollar parking, and
they offered coupons that fans could
use to purchase a hot dog and a coke
for a buck. Again, how about
nachos? I know people who would
be crazy enough to attend a Buc
Night if the nachos instead of the hot
dogs were discounted.

Another way to use this Buc Night '

feature would be to slightly increase
the number of them. Have one Buc
Night for each national league team.

One feature that would be perfect
for Pittsburgh fans would be a fight
song. Steeler fans love their fight
song._This song could,be played by
the organist whenever the Pirates
threaten a rally. And we all know
how rowdy this city’s fans can get.

None of these suggestions is going
to create a 30,000 average for the
Pirates, but making the game a more
pleasant experience cannot possibly
hurt. The alcohol-less family sec-
tions were a good idea. Let’s come
up with some more.

Just think how many wrestling
fanatics would show up if Hulk
Hogan were to throw out the first
pitch.

  Lady

Panthers
take tenth
straight

The Pitt Lady Panther volleyball ‘

team swept the Pitt Invitational over
the weekend with consecutive victo-
ries over West Virginia, Villanova
and Seton Hall. The Lady Panthers
were powered by the play of junior
Sue Hoover, the tournament MVP,
and freshman Nora Mulvihill who
led the squad with 34 kills.

“I’m pretty pleased with the way
we performed this weekend," said
head coach Shelton Collier. “We
have a lot of young players that are
being integrated into a program that

' traditionally wins. They are now

starting
attitude.”

For a while, it looked as ifthe only
thing the Lady Panthers would
develop this past weekend was bore-
dom. Hurricane Gloria closed the
turnpike and all the airports on the
eastern seaboard on Friday, so the
tournament was put on hold until it
was sure that the participating
teams, especially Villanova and
Seton Hall, would be there.

The Lady Panthers ended up
playing against the Pitt men’s volley-
ball club. It turned out to be a good
match. The Lady Panthers lost, but
Collier was happy with the oppor-
tunity to play against the men’s club.

“I think it really helped our team,”
said Collier. “Our team played a
higher level of volleyball.”

The Lady Panthers defeated West
Virginia 15-13, 15-17, 15-5, 15-2 in
their opening round match of the
round robin tournament. Villanova
was the second victim, falling 15-6,
15-8, 8-15, 15-5. Pitt wrapped up the
tournament championship with a
decisive win over Seton Hall, 15-5,
15-3, 15-11.

e ton Collier

The Seton Hall victory marked
the tenth consecutive match that the
Lady Panthers have won. It was also
the second consecutive tournament
that Co1lier’s squad has won. The
Lady Panthers won the Temple Invi-
tational last weekend.

While Hoover was earning the
MVP and all-tournament team
honors, she managed to register 32
kills. Mulvihill joined her on the all-
tournament team, along with team-
mate Judy Young, Beth Hoffman
and Nancy Merkle from West Vir-
ginia, Karen Rank from Villanova
and Karilyn Bachman from Seton
Hall. West Virginia finished second
in the tournament, Villanova third
and Seton Hall brought up the rear.

This week the Lady Panthers
travel to Penn State for a tri-match
with the Lady Lions and George
Washington University.

“Penn State has been playing
pretty well,” said Collier. “Our Penn
State match is always real signifi-
cant.” Collier added, “Objectively,
they are not as strong as they were
last year. We both lost some really
key seniors.”

After Penn State, the Lady Pan-
thers have a Big East match at
Georgetown on October 6, then host
Bowling Green on October 12. .

The Pitt News - September 30, 1985

By. Bob Travers

Hunting season approaches

Dec. 1 — It's5.'30 in the morning
Outside, it 3' dark and silent. A man
gets out of bed and puts his‘ ('/t)!/’I¢”.\

on — three layers worth; the radio

said it would be in the low 205 today
with a good chance of snow. He
walks to the kitchen and heats up the
stove. He puts a pot of coffee on, and
bacon and eggs. The disappearing
moonlight casts strange shadows on
the table. He checks his riﬂe and
looks outside. He turns back to his
breakfast. It is hunting season.

That scene will be repeated count-
less times this fall and winter in cab-
ins and houses all over this fair state
we call Pennsylvania. In places like
Armstrong, Bucks, Green, and Pot-
ter counties, hunting season is the
main sporting event. It's bigger than
the Super Bowl out there, bigger
than the forests themselves. Bigger
than the earth, bigger than the gal-
axy, even bigger than Live Aid. OK,
maybe not bigger than Live Aid. But
you get the idea: itfs important. Peo-
ple get killed doing it. People look
forward to hunting season all year
long. ’

Why?

I don’t want to get into the moral
implications of killing a poor, help-
less deer or rabbit, or somebody’s
blowing Bambi’s brains out. I don’t
want to get into the relative merits of
killing a 900-lb. grizzly bear or the
value of having the skill to shoot
down a duck at dawn. ljust want to
know why. Why and how could
anybody enjoy hunting, and notjust
hunting but all the so-called outdoor
sports.? 1

My personal theory is that these
outdoor sportsmen have a streak of
masochism in them. Why else would
otherwise rational beings subject
themselves to the winter forests at 6
a.m., tramp around in waist—high
snow dressed in colors that a clown
would consider outrageous, all for
the purpose of looking for an animal
they have about as much chance of

—r.—-

fintnng as Jimmy Carter has becom-
ing the lead musician of Black
Sabbath‘?

Fishermen are just as bad. Here‘s
a bunch of guys who stand around
on the edge ofa lake or in the middle
of a stream in hip-high boots and
hats that often go beyond the
bounds of good taste or even human
decency. And what do the fishermen
do?

They stand. And they wait. And
wait. And wait and wait. Then, when
they finally do get a bite, it’s either
too small to feed an Ethiopian or a
fish that’s so strung out from years
of acid rain that it doesn't care
whether it lives or dies. (l’ll bet you
never considered the fact that acid
rain is creating a nation of lakes
filled with junkies.)

At least hunters get to move
around. They walk for hours. They
never go anywhere: they just walk
around the woods looking for ani-

mals and things to kill. Sometimes a

hunter will move very last when a
fellow outdoorsman mistakes him
for a 12-point buck.

I can just see that conversation at
the game warden’s office.

“Honest, Mr. Warden, sir, I swear
I thought it was one of them deer all
dressed up in bright colors, you
know, for Christmas or something
 Well, I thought maybe he learned
hisself how to walk on two legs 
Yes, 1 supposel thoughtthat if a
deer could teach hisself how to walk
he could surely learn to talk  I
think he said, ‘Don’t shoot me, I’m
human,” but what I heard at the time
was, ‘Don’t shoot me or I’m suing.’
 Sure, I thought deer had the right
to an attorney  I know I promised
last year when I blowed up that Boy
Scout camp this would never
happen again, and I’m real sorry, sir

. but these things happen.”

Itjustseems to me that all these
outdoorsman types are going about
things the wrong way. They say

hunting and fishing are good ways to
get in touch with nature. Well, why
not get in touch with nature in July,
when it’s about 75 degrees and
sunny? Not on some icy morning in a
frozen lake. That's not getting ‘in
touch with nature, that’s called get-
ting in touch with an emergency
room because of frostbite. (Not to
mention getting in touch with a good
analyst who could maybe ﬁgure out
why a person would inflict such pain
on himself.)
I’m rooting for the deer this hunt-
ing season.

Nehlen-——

continued from page 11

the score 10-'9, Nehlen had to decide
whether to go for the tie or the lead.
“I thought the momentum had
finally changed, and we felt if we
could hold them one time, and they
punt, we’re in great shape‘. Anytime
you don’t play the odds, you’re
crazy. So I didn’t even think about it
[going for two].”

And thus the 78th meeting
between the backyard brawlers
ended in a tie for only the second
time in its history, and it left Nehlen
a happy man, “Had we been ahead
10-0 then I would have been very
disappointed in the tie, but we came
from behind,” he said. ‘‘I think I got
some positive things to talk to my
squad about.”

Which brings up the question,
how will this tie affect head coach
Foge Fazio and the Pitt Panthers,
who were already feeling the heat
and are now l-2-1? “First of all,”
said Nehlen, ”I love Foge, and I
hope that they’re able to build on it.
But therc’s no question it will be

harder for them to come out of it_

because they were the ones up 10-0.
They’re going to feel almost like it
was a loss.”

body’s defense to fight off
the disease naturally.

Already, scientists are
working on mechanisms to
makethe body rejectcancer.

And the promise for the
future is staggering.

Wouldn’t you feel good
knowing you contributed to
the research?

Please contribute. Your
dollars will help further all
our cancer research. '

We want to wipe out can-
cer in your lifetime.
