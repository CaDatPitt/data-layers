Rufus Fitzgerald announc-

of the University‘ as" a ‘whole,

the" investigating‘ committee wrote: “The evaluating com-

, The . committee found major
criticism in library facilities, es-
pecially in the ﬁelds of humanities

Constructive criticism contin-

are still ‘insufficient, and its fa-3

‘so. But its oﬂicers and trustees
are conscious of its educational
needs, have plans to meet them,
and are achieving _reasonable ,
success in doing so.” -
Last November 5, 6, and 7, the
evaluating team of 42 educators,
composed of a number of deans and
college presidents, came to Pitt
under a new program "of evalua-
tions for accreditation which had .
been adopted by the Middle States
Association and the‘ National
Commission ‘on Accrediting.
Previous to their arrival, the

Problem

J. Clyde" Barton, -secretary of the’ general. alumni asso-
ciation, said Wednesday that despite statements to the con-
trary the alumni “want new buildings.” ~

Mr. Barton made the alumni stand after being’ questioned

concerning the statement of

Allan M. Scaife, chairman

ofithe ‘board of trustees, that the’
attitude of no new buildings on
the Cathedral lawn did “not nee- ’
essarily conﬁne  «.
itself to the
‘t r u s t e e s but
was a feeling of
the alumni.”

Although Mr.
Barton didnot
deny the st-ate-
by Mr.
Scaife he said
that the job of
the alumni is to
assist the .Uni- BART0
versity—not run ‘
it. He added that “what the alum-
ni want is new buildings, period.”

Education Looking
To Labor, Says
Head of Schools

Speaking on “What ‘Education
Expects of Labor,” Dr. Vergil M.

Rogers, superintendent of schools
at Battle Creek, Michigan, told
Pitt’s School Board of Institute
on Wednesday that “labor today
has public approval and accept-
ance.”

“Leaders in the labor move-
ment in America,” he continued,
“have recognized that if the la-
borer is to have equal rights with
property rights, an adequate sys-
tem of free public schools must be
developed and maintained.

“Education is looking to labor
for help in protecting and defend-
ing schools, in contributing to ﬁ-

nance, in protecting our school

systems from unscrupulous and

destructive critics and in planning

and upholding the

educational
program.” '

The rumor that property would

Controvery Not New

This controversy over the avail-
ability of adequate land for Pitt’s
new policy of converting Pitt from
.a streetcar college to a campus
college began several weeks ago
when Mr. Scaife said that the lawn
could never be used for new build-
ings because it would ruin its
beauty.

Chancellor Rufus H. Fitzgerald
said, the same day, that land was
the main reason for the lag in
Pitt’s building campaign.

‘The iworléerilsillnique

. . By Tim Kovar ,

We ‘receive newspapers and publications from

one of the best and most outstanding of these pub-
lications is a sort of humor magazine with a news-
paper format. It’s called I “The Worker,”- and as
we understand, is a brother journal to “The Daily
Worker.”‘ .'

Now as we said, the very
clever editors of this ,magazine
have developed a format very

tabloid newspaper. They have
news, features, pictures, editori-

they have everything that _a -3
REAL inew_s_paper ,has—excep_t '
advertisements. Yes indeedy,
the men and women behind this i‘

   

‘newspaper, as we shall call it, are really‘veryt_al-
_ented people. and show great promise in the jour-

nalism ﬁeld.

A Little Too Bitter:

As we said, they have everything but adver-
tisements. No doubt this‘ is a very tender spot in
the publisher’s pink skinand he certainly has every

right to be sensitive about this failing. Ohimy,

yes! .Unfortunately, the editorial writer for the
“newspaper” got a little bitter on the subject in
a recent edition and complained about the fact in
his article. He was very perturbed, as was his
right, because “The Worker” received very little

of the two and one—half billion dollars that is

spent on, national‘ newspaper advertising. I-Ie
blamed the advertisers for this because they didn’t
agree with the paper’s political position. N ow‘ what-

he pleaded for contributors and admitted that “The
Worker” had been "running heavily in the red."
‘How very true. Yea,Vverily, a point well put!
No Criticism Meant

We also think very highly of the newspaper’s

policy as a champion of the working class and a"

defender of the minority groups in this country.
On these subjects, as well as their efforts to berate
and criticize the “wallstreet tycoons” and “capi-
talists” and those nasty old “trusts” and corpora-
tions which control everything from baseball to sex,
their writers are proliﬁc,. verbose, and even a
teensy-weensy bit on. the bitter. side. Of course,
this is only natural and our mentioning of it should
not be construed as criticism. Oh my, no!

“The Worker” attitude on the'Tide1ands Oil,

controversy was also very interesting and enter-
taining. They labeled the entire idea as a con-
spiracy by the “robber barons” of the big monopo-
lies at the expense of the workers, poorifarmers,
and small businessmen. Excellently stated, fellow

scribes. Yours is a magniﬁcent endeavor in the-

true "cause of . . . of . . .-Well, you know what" I
‘mean! '
A Little Consideration. Please _

I have only two real criticisms for this news-
paper. In the ﬁrst place, I think it is decidedly
unfair’ to belabor and blast the businessmen who
enjoy playing golf "occasionally. After all, it ‘is a
. sport that is also played by members of tradeiun-
ions, ‘farmers, and members of minority classes.
The second point on which "I disagree with you is

‘the type and quality "of the newspaper which you
use. Really gentlemen, I think you should im-
prove the quality of your paper. Many of’ your
suffering readers” have complained that it is pain-

’ fully inferior to the materials used by" such paper-

Did the Pan

By Elinore Stone
The new editors for the Pitt
. News and Owl have been picked
and everything’s set for ‘next

year. .But things don’t look so-

good for our ill-fated magazine,
the Panther.  “‘

Little has been said about the
Panther’s fu- *3’
ture. No one’s
talking. But, I
have a feeling
it won’t be
back. And it’s
a darn shame.

As far as I
can _see, the
only reason,
for_ discontin-
uing its publi-

cation this time 1S lack of fund

It all depends on which night
you saw the shows, too. The
sagging tents and poor sound re-
production of Tuesday didn’t
leave an impression as good as
that of ' Wednesday night when
everything was on aprofessional
scale.

Even "trying ,to pick out the

high points is like trying to pick V

year met with no forceful disap-

. proval.

When the new ‘Panther staff
set to work last September,,they
had a deﬁnite obligation to ful-

ﬁll in the type of material they_

were to bring before the students
and faculty. The new Panther
was to be a feature-pictorial pub-
lication, limited in content -to
University schools, departments,

student organizations, activities
and athletics.

Most important of all, it was
to be non-satirical. Satire can be
excellent humor. The Panther
staff was not to dabble in it. I

-think that -restriction was the

Publications Board’s ﬁrst mis-
take.

" Give 'em a Chance

Understaffed, the editors tried

some outstanding things that
should be mentioned. One was
the perfectcoordination in the
Sigma Chi‘ show between the
actors and the records. Even .or-
dinary mimicry is hard toldo but
when it is done ‘to a Spike Jones
type of record it requires ﬂexi-
ble muscles and the memory of

a professor who gives G grades.

fact in the journalism world. The
Panther needs at least another
year to prove‘ itself. -

The third and worst mistake
that’s been made, however, to get
back to money, was not giving
the Panther an assessment to
help them pay costs.

' While at the national Pi ‘Delta
Epsilon convention for college
journalists at the University of
Cincinnati recently, some of us
from Pitt talked with the editor

of the Cincinnati magazine. They ‘

have a ﬁne magazine there, writ-
ten in good taste. They also re-

university to help defrey their

expenses. — .

 Squad

There’s a fast- stepping
group of menlon campus who
make fancy drilling their
free-time specialty. ‘

They are 24 Air Force ca-
dets and members of a newly-

a senior Air Force ROTC cadet.

The idea of the drill team was i

I-Iuc_lson’s, who was one of two
outstanding senior cadets honored
a week ago at federal ROTC in-
spection. He picked mainly fresh-
menland sophomores when the or-
ganization began last, September.

Choice 24 Selected _
With a‘ go-ahead signal from
the air cadet’s director, Colonel
John E. Murray, Hudson combed
more than 50 men who applied
and decided on a choice 24 to
learn the fancy footwork of a top’
drill" team. .
. The men started. with basic
steps, then advanced to ‘trick
drills. ’During the winter g they

Drill Team Busy

Although new on . campus, the
team has had a busy year. Primar-
they performed at special
functions where men in the Arm-
old Air Society and the Pershing
Riﬂes did not drill. They drilled
at. Dean’s Inspection two weeks»
ago, Federal Inspection last Fri-
day, and appeared at half—time
ceremonies at the Old Timers
football game last Saturday.

Tomorrow they’ll liven up the
Armed Forces Day parade down-
town with a bit of their strutting. A

former member of the squad, they
hope "to drill at regular football
games. And the team may be

even enjoy playing football.”

On the whole most of the so-

this program. Janet Sopher, pres-

Tom Hamilton, recent develop-
ments have had no concrete effect
on the -plans of the University.

“We’ve given a lot of thought
in the last few years to the for-
mation of various combinations
of schools which might possibly
make up a. conference,” he said,
“but so far there is nothing to
report.” _

Usually mentioned when dis-
cussions arise concerning a pros-

pective alliance are Pitt, Penn,

State, West Virginia and various
Eastern schools. And since WVU

and others now are among the .

scattered SC remains, plans for
the district again are being pro-
posed, unoﬁicially,:of course.
Pursuing the subject in gen-
eral, Hamilton said, “A confer-
ence must be set up according
to certain standards—compatible
as to education, athletics, and.
methodsof operation.”

Many feel that such an alliance
would be a great thing for Pitt
athletics, but too many prohibitive
factors existin the East.

and with the help of Panhellenic
we.hope to be even more success-
ful.”

Olsonmen Seek 2nd

Against Nittanies

By DAVE MAZER
Whenever Pitt and Penn State get together there’s a
close battle and tomorrow afternoon’s track meet at the
Stadium should follow form even though the Panthers are

given . a slight edge.

The meet starts at 1:§0 p.m. ~
Coach Carl Olson’s speedsters rate the margin in the
clash for Tri—State supremacy because of their _better times

thers a strong entry inboth the

ters.
In the other track events, Al
Gunderson and Bernie Luteran-
cik look to top Penn State’s Bob

In Roosevelt Grier, the Nittany
Lions have a potential three-event
winner. Grier - is entered in the
shot put, discus, and javelin and

D-udas

in all three has recorded distances

farther than the Panthers.
The other ﬁeld events should

    

prove interesting as Dan Lorch,
State’s IC4A indoor champ in the
pole vault, duels with Don Mini-
hang and Jim Herb, one’ of the
East’s better high jumpers com-
petes with Ruschel and Frank
Christopher.

Ruschel, though, should rave his
own way in the . broad jump
against State’s Ron Johnson since
he has leaped over 22 feet.

Pitt will be seeking its second‘

dual meet win and also its second
consecutive triumph over State.

Gridders. Cdgers
Far from Rowdy

By RUSS FRANKE
Sports Editor

 

Since so many readers who chanced upon the tennis
column which -appeared in this corner in last Friday’s issue
feel that somethinggbe said in behalf of football and basket-

‘ball, it seems that a rebuttal is in order.

’ Realizing the pitfalls of blindly extolling the virtues of
* a favorite subject, we will not attempt to say that one sport
is superior to the other, nor will we try to prove that Gene
Weinstein (not to be confused with Boris Weinstein, who,
out ofa job, is now in the soup line) is even slightly out of line.
Far be it from Gene to wax partial on the subject of tennis-
but it is obvious he wasdoing a bit of tongue-in-cheek daily-
’ ing when he wrote the article.’ ~
We’re going to take a page,from his book, therefore, and do

‘ a little rebuttlin’. ’

Is it necessary in football that two opponents should, like ten-

' nis foes, walk off the scene arm in arm?

{ .,After Tech Loss

Hardly. In fact, it would be downright embarrassing for
9 a gridder to ﬁnd himself on the other team’s bench. ‘
H “On the (tennis) bench,” the article read, “the host team. has a
box of sliced oranges.” Tsk. Tsk.

If there is any chewing to be done on the football or basketball
bench, you can be sure that the coach will do, it. Further, space
does not permit enumerating the‘ list’ of things a football player
would think, about before he got down to oranges.

Now, this is not a ridicule of the racquet boys. Tennis is a
very strenuous and gruelling game, polite conduct nothwithstand-
mg. -

But men in other. sports also observe certain rules of decorum.
The halfback who has just stepped on his would-be tackler’s face
-—dislodging the poor chap’s lower I mandible—often pauses‘ long
enough tosay,‘ “Sorry, old man, chin up.” ,

“You had the breaks,” is the muﬂled retort. . I

Sure, he’ll be eating his dinner through a straw for a while,
but no obvious\dislike is displayed. . ,

We’ll skip’ the part about character—building, because it de-
pends upon the individual, invany sport. -

But there was another charge, against basketball, in particular,
about the only thing preventing .clipping being the referee’s eye-
sight. A ' ' '

'_ It comes ‘ as. a _surprise "to learn that athletes are still de-
..pending upon _the eyesight of referees. (Eh, Doc?) 4 . ’ _ .

By their very nature, these‘contact sports actually foster and
encourage “rowdyism.” Nice guys don’t win ball games, they say.

It appears that they do in tennis matches, though, so you can
see ‘the conﬂictions in comparing sports of totally different natures—
enjoying them is the important thing. ‘ ‘

Anyone for badminton? I ~‘

  Mittmen Seek 4th  Win

By WILL HLIVKO

Coachi Ralph Mitterling’s
baseball squad makes its ﬁnal
road trip of the season to-
morrow when they travel to
Morgantown for a game with
West Virginia. .

For the Panthers, it will be
anattempt to make it four straight
wins over the Mounties over a two
year span. Previous to. last sea-
son, the Mittmen managed to win
only two games out of eleven
from the Mountaineers.

In an attempt to stop the NCAA
district 2-bound Panthers, West
Virginia Coach Steve Harrick will
pitch frosh star Jim I-Ieise. The

Arighthander has been the only

bright spot in an other dismal
baseball year for the Mounties.
