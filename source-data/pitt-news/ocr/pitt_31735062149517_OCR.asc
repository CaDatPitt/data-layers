Portraying the lighter side of life
at the Virginia Military institute, as
interpreted by authors Fred R. Fink-

a hit on Broadway and on the road.
Later the play was adapted to the
movies. The cinema “Brother Rat,”
starring Priscilla Lane and Wayne
Morris, was also a hit.

The Players’ version of the stage
and screen success will be the third
such production of the group for the
present year. “Holiday,” the ﬁrst,
was followed by “Kind Lady.”

 

Women Launch
Placement Drive

All administrative officers and fac-
ulty members received bulletins last
week from the department of the
dean of women, designed to test their
knowledge of Women’s placement.

This procedure is a part of a cam-
paign to obtain positions on campus
for University women students.

Five questions and answers pic-
tured on an old-fashioned slate make
up the bulletin.

The slate explains that ‘he depart-
ment of the dean of women main-
tains a Placement Bureau for under-
graduate women, former women stu-
dents who have withdrawn from the
University, and women who have al-
ready graduated and desire employ-
ment. This bureau is under the di-

rection of Miss Frances McLaughlin,

assistant dean of women.

During the past year 406 under-
graduate women were placed by the
bureau. This does not include NYA
assignments.

Will Pick Delegates
For Refugee Drive

Selection bf four additional mem-
bers to serve on the executive board
of the student committee attempting
to provide for the education of a
number of European refugee students
at the University will be made to-
morrow.

Student-Faculty Association, Inter-
fraternity Council, and Panhellenic
Council will choose their representa-
tives to the executive board of the
refugee aid committee at meetings to-
morrow afternoon and evening.

First contribution to the proposed
drive to provide funds for the educa-
tion of European refugee students at
the University arrived in The News
office Friday.

Included with the check for three
dollars was the following note:

“As a student of the University
I want to congratulate you oh your
generous and farsighted view re-
garding scholarships for refugees.
The contribution I enclose is not
meant so much as ﬁnancial aid as it
is to encourge you in your efforts;
in tangible form it expresses the
enthusiasm and appreciation of one’
of the students of the University. I
wish the amount were comparable
with my feelings.

“Good wishes to you in this ven-
ture.”

Robert Dannies, BA39; Kenneth Ry-
den, C39; and Lea Goldstein, C39.
The News will be represented on the
board of seven members by John
Martinco, C39, editor.

Deﬁnite plans _of action for the
committee will be formulated by the
executive board by the end of this
week and submitted to the general
student committee. In addition to
the planning of the drive done by
students thus far, interest in the
project to aid victims of foreign in-
tolerance has evidenced by represen-
tatives of the University faculty and
administration. .

Problems which the University
committee must face include deter-
mining the number of students which
can be provided for, the -methods of
raising funds, and other subsequent
arrangements.

The articles will explain the nature of the

organizations, eligibility requirements, and other information for pros-

pective tappees.

By Harold Wintner

Four of the best known honoraries
-on campus are Sigma Tau, Beta
Gamma Sigma, Sigma Gamma Epsi-
Ion, and Pi Tau Phi, each a repre-
sentative of a different school. The
ﬁrst three are national fraternities,
the last a local organization.

Sigma Tau is an honorary engi-
neering fraternity. Students in the
upper one-third of the junior and
senior engineering classes are eli-
ggible to be tapped to membership.
Requirements are scholarship, prac-
ticality, and sociability.

Following its annual custom, Sig-
ma Tau will award two medals to
the sophomore engineering or min-
ing students who have scored the
highest quality point average during
their freshman year. These awards
are regarded as one of the highest
"honors accorded freshman students
by the apping bodies.

didates for Beta Gamma Sigma,

and women are admitted solely on

the basis of scholastic standing. Near- f membership dllring their ‘$911101’ Year-
13, an tappees are seniors, although ‘ Scholastic achievement IS the only

the highest several in the junior

class are eligible for membership.

Like Sigma Tau, Beta Gamma
Sigma also recognizes freshman
achievements, awarding a certiﬁcate
of merit to the highest ranking fresh-
man in the School of Business Ad-
ministration.

National honorary fraternity of
the School of Mines is Sigma Gam-
ma Epsilon, which taps outstanding
mining, metallurgy, petroleum en-
gineering, and geology students.
Qualiﬁcations for membership in-
clude not only scholastic standing,
but also sociability and practicality.
Only seniors and juniors are eligible.

standing senior student who has
§completed four years of undergrad-
'uate study in the School of Mines.

3 University, one of the most important
lis Pi Tau Phi, College scholastic. It
iincludes a larger percentage of stu-

Henry Deltocher, M40, produc-
tion manager for the 1939 Cap and
Gown show, “At Your Service,” an-
nounced today that Cap and Gown
registration and tryout schedules
must be rigidly followed.

Deltocher advised all those in-
terested in any detail of production
to acquaint themselves with the
complete schedule, as appearing in
The News.

plications for all Cap and Gown po-
sitions must be ﬁled at the Cap and
Gown desk in the eighth floor lobby
either Wednesday or Thursday this
week.

“That all candidates must sign ap-
plications cannot be overstressed,”
DeRocher stated. “Everyone, whether
or not they have been appointed to
a Cap and Gown position as yet, in-
cluding all staffs, must present an
eligibility card and sign on Wednes-
day or Thursday.”

The staffs for which registration
must be made include, besides the
cast chorus and chorale, the produc-
tion, technical, costume, make—upa
publicity, and business divisions.
This registration does not necessarily
imply application as those who have
already been appointed to positions
must register.

Chorus and dance tryouts will be
held next Monday evening at 8:30
and Tuesday at 7:30, Biddle announc-
ed. All persons trying out for either
chorus or cast positions must ap-
pear. Persons who have danced,
either in the chorus or the cast, in
previous Cap and Gown shows, need
not appear at the tryouts.

Final auditions for Cap and Gown
songs will be held Thursday even-
ing, February 16, at 8:15 o’clock, ac-
cording to Biddle. Composers should
consult him about speciﬁc situations

Religions Emphasis \Veek, con-
ducted annually through the co-
operative efforts of faculty, stu-
dents, and campus groups, opens
this morning. Its activities will
be known as the Campus Confer-
ence on Religion and Life.

Throughout the week, a number of
nationally-known religious and lay
leaders will speak at meetings, semi-
nars, luncheons, and special convoca-
tions to present religion and Christi-
anity in its modern interpretations.

Discussion of problems other than
religious will be undertaken also.
Lectures and symposiums on mar-
riage, problems of democracy, human
relations, and student leadership have
been planned. Speakers at these
meetings are recognized authorities in
their respective ﬁelds.

Campus Conference is not conﬁned
to membersof any single group, or to
students of any one school, states Dr.
S. P. Franklin, professor of religious
education, local chairman. Its pro-
gram has been designed to meet the
needs of the entire University.

Plans for the Conference were laid
nearly a year ago, and local commit-
tees in the University, Carnegie In-
stitute of Technology, and Pennsyl-
vania College for Women, have
worked throughout the year to obtain
a group of visiting and local speak-
ers who would be best suited to an
event of this type.

University Mission, to which a
large part of the out—of-town speak-
ers belong, is conducting similar pro-
grams in campus conferences in all
of America’s university centers.

Panhel Holds
Sing Tonight

Fraternity women will hold their
annual Interfraternity Sing this
evening at 7 o’clock in the Heinz
House.

Each year the women's fraterni-
ties get together to sing songs and
to present skits in an atttempt to win
the Interfraternity Sing coed cup.
The theme of this year’s sing is “ad-
vertising.” The women are plan-
ning to use advertising slogans and
to interpret them by skits.

According to the rules of the Sing,
only eight members are permitted to
represent each fraternal group. Each
skit is limited to six minutes in
length, and will be judged for clev-
erness, originality, spirit, and sing-
mg.

The judges for the event include
Walter R. Hovey, associate professor
of ﬁne arts; Mrs. Mildred C. Lissfelt,
director of Women’s Choral; Edwin
L. Peterson, professor of English;
Dr. Elizabeth Rearick, associate pro-
fessor of physical education; and Dr.
John J. Geise, associate professor of
history. '

The chairman of the event is Jane

 

Cleaver, Ed40. Assisting her are
Ruth Vogeel, Ed39; and Evelyn
Bortz, C39.

Invitations to attend the Sing have
been extended to women members
of the faculty and to the home moth-
ers of the fraternities, according to
Miss Cleaver.

Students to Trade in Gold Bricks
in Return for Copies of l939 Uwl

“The gold rush hits Pitt!”

nounced Al Kairys, BA39, Owl busi-
ness manager, this morning as The
Owl began a “search for gold” con-
test for all undergraduate students.

According to Kairys, a faculty
committee composed of Robert Ma-
chesney, Miss Frances McLaughlin,
and Theodore Biddle, have hidden
10 gold bricks on the following floors
of the Cathedral of Learning: ﬁrst,
second, third,, eighth, ninth, tenth,
eleventh, and twelfth.

The ﬁrst ﬁve undergraduate stu-
dents to ﬁnd a gold brick and report
with it to Mr. Machesney’s office,
1328 Cathedral, will be awarded free
copies of the 1939 Owl.

Kairys promises that this is only
one of the contests planned for un-
dergraduate students during the Owl
campaign.

“In this ‘search for gold,’ ” he says,
“no places on the ﬂoors named are
barred. A brick miight be hidden in
any corner. People ﬁnding the bricks

should report to Mr. Machesney’s ‘

an-9

oﬁice at once. The ﬁrst ﬁve comers
will be awarded copies of The 1939
Owl.

Kairys has also requested that all
salesmen who received orders for
yearbooks last week, entitling the
purchasers to their names on the
covers, should turn in those orders
at the Owl office before ﬁve o’clock
this afternoon.

All students who buy their books
from a salesman before the salesman
turns in his orders at ﬁve today can
be included in this special offer of
having their names printed free on
the cover of their Owl. According to
Kairys, this offer can not be contin-
ued because of the cost to The Owl
of having the names printed.

The year book is on sale by 75 un-
dergraduates and a down payment of
one dollar and a half, or two dollars,
will secure the book until May, when
the remainder will be paid. Total
cost of The Owl is three dollars and
ﬁfty cents.

‘Campus Confer-once’
Explores Life

'1‘ HAS an imposing and rather ponderous title——
this “Campus Conference on Religion and Life,”

which begins this morning on three local college
campuses.

Just as imposing, though not so ponderous, is the
list of sponsors and the full week ’s program, which,
with apologies to a certain local magazine, we can
only term “jam-packed” with activities.

Imposing, too, is the list of guest speakers who
will take part in everything from worship services
to fraternity bull—sessions being held at the Univer-
sity, Carnegie Tech, and Pennsylvania College for
VVomen. _

But it is not this imposing array of talent, this
almost overwhelming program, the long—winded
title that primarily interests us. Perhaps the_key-
note of our interest is struck by the theme, printed
in the program in small t’ype—“Christ1anity in the
Modern World.”

Religion, we have always thought, has too long
been embalmed in the pulpit, has too long pursued
a cloistered, “ivory—tower” attitude toward the
realities of life. Religious principles have too long
been conﬁned to an abstract concept, have tended
too much to become separated from every-day, un-
attractive considerations.

We were, therefore, pleased to discover that the
conference intends to make application of some of
these principles of religion t'o “the modern world.”
And in reading over the program it was encourag-
ing to note the long list of meetings which deal
with social, and political, and economic problems
as well as purely religious abstractions.

Christianity, we are convinced, has a deﬁnite con-
tribution to make toward the betterment of condi-
tions in an ailing world. But it can not do so by
shying away from these problems.

Only by applying to modern conditions and prob-
lems its worthy tenets, can Christianity really take
its rightful place in the modern world. The “Cam-
pus Conference,” it appears, is making a deﬁnite
contribution in that direction.

Some Opinions 4
On Refugee Students

I-IE current nation-wide movement among col-
lege students to provide for refugee students has
attracted attention from many sources. Among
some of the reactions are the following individual
and editorial comments:
-“.(=
President J. B. Conant, of Harvard University:
“This endeavor of the Harvard College students
to raise money by their own efforts to aid refugees
is of importance primarily as a symbol of the de-
termination of the younger generation to show by
deeds as well as by words that the humanitarian
basis of democracy is not dead.”
1»! $|= as
Dorothy Thompson, noted columnist, writing in

Survey Graphic:

“The impulse Which prompted our own young
people to undertake this support is highly com-
mendable. It indicates a. generous spirit and a.
positive democracy, and the refugee students
themselves would in most cases add to the color,

interest, and culture of University life.”

Editorial in Vassar News (whose president, Henry
N. Ma.cCracken, is honorary treasurer of the In-
tercollegiate Committee to Aid Student Refu-
gees) :

“\Ve can oﬁer a warm welcome and opportu-,
nities for work to the refugees who, because of
their talents and culture should be, not an eco-
nomic menace, but valuable members of any com-
munity. ”

=R-'
Editorial in Carnegie Tech Tartan:

“Action of this type by American students is
important not only as to the immediate aid which
it affords a. few of the scholastically outstand-
ing victims of Nazi terror, but also because it
stands out as a symbol of our deterniination to
show the totalitarian nations that t. 3 human-
itarian basis of democracy still exists.”

Bare Legs and Red Hair

A recent survey revealed 37 per cent of North-
western university’s co-eds go barelegged to classes
while those with ﬂaming tresscs at Wheaton

And so, it is with genuine sadness that I note that our
icoeds have taken to perching these awful monstrosi-
ties that pass for hats on the tops of their pretty heads. ’

This is something of a shock, for Pitt women have
usually followed the straight and narrow. Unlike the
good old girls from Vassar, they do
not wear silk gowns running up into 1
the hundreds and then launch out:
into violent tirades (always released
for publication) about Japanese im-
perialism. Our coeds go to romantic
movies, and still date us. And they
are nice in so many ways—they still
believe that college is a place where
you study, they crinkle their noses
 most delightfully when they laugh,
A they ride the street cars, and they
have evolved a shag step that is fun

 

Brown
to do and yet within the bounds of sanity and good
taste.

But they have gone off the deep end in this matter
of hats.

As I understand it, from reading copies of my moth-
er’s Good Housekeeping, a woman’s clothes are supposed
to express her personality.

After intensive deliberation, I do not see how these
crazy replicas of coal scuttles and dish cloths and hum-
ming birds’ nests help to express personality. Instead,
the parade of the centuries and the cultures of nations
pass in haphazard review as we see imitations of
banana plants from the South Seas, helmets like those
the Roman legions wore, and gaudy bonnets culled from
the headresses of the medicine men of Zulu land.

These hats have accomplished only one constructive
thing at the University. They have eliminated the
small talk in the elevators. When a girl gets on the car
wearing a hat that looks like a cross between a bee-
hive and an obelisk, conversation ceases. Who feels
like talking with the awful thing staring him in the
face? Who can argue with a professor about a grade
when all the passengers are ducking wildly to save
their eyesight from being ruined by a two—foot feather
that waves about with disconcerting abandon?

These jobs that would make Queen Mary, who has a
reputation for occasionally looking like a walking orch-
ard, green with envy were supposed to originate in
Paris. I was there this summer, and while I did not
know French well enough to talk about the foreign sit-
uation, I do know that the girls who whipped along the
Seine did not wear anything resembling the upper part
of a scarecrow in slow stages of disintegration.

And so I propose a little crusade to be taken part in
by the men at the University. Let us titter loudly when
one of the garish hats appear. Let us be raccous, and
even offensive, if some head dress blocks oﬁ our view
of the Nixon stage from Peanut Heaven. The women.
had better watch out. Mark my words.

Caucus . . .
By Alvin Malakoff

For the few people who get elected, for the few more
who run in opposition or attempt to be nominated, for,

ised dance chairmanships, and for the faculty who can
sit by and watch, campus politics is “good, clean fun.”
But for the ordinary student, it’s just something that
happens in the spring. Little colored cards are passed
around, and everybody’s the voter’s friend. They try to
get him to push a few levers down, a few things go
round, and certain people are listed as winners in the

next issue of The News. After that nobody’s friendly

anymore.
Somehow, campus politics ought to be more than just
fun or lethargy. After all, this is a university, a place

of learning. Why shouldn’t student government serve
-as a place to learn the techniques of democratic control,
as well as a laboratory to test new ones. It ought to be
more than just something to amuse students, or to keep
them in line.

Anyhow, we feel that campus politics can be more
than the “good clean fun” that Nick Spanos called it.
It’s one of the problems of students of government and
of educators these days as to what it takes to make a
good citizen. They generally concede that training by
experience in the actual control of everyday affairs is
one of the best ways to learn to be a good democratic
citizen.

For the average American, there is very little chance
to get any training in being a citizen of a democracy
before he is 21 and takes up his active citizenship. He
votes without any previous practice. Our public schools
provide no chance to learn democratic control of any-
thing important. Ask any progressive educator and see
what he says.

i It is this experience that campus politics can provide.
-If our student government is given a chance to decide
any questions that really make a difference to a large
number of students, if it captures the power of the purse
over some of the activities of the school, then campus
voters will care who is president of SFA.

However, don’t get us wrong. While we feel that
campus politics should be more than fun, we don’t feel
that fun should be eliminated. This column will con-
tinue in part in the tradition of last year’s Racket, re-
porting all the latest gossip among the political circles.
So:

Grapevine reports that what rnay be the start
of a beautiful split in the fraternity ranks occurred last
weel: when PIKA President I-lay Light tried for
the Spring festival chairmanship. VVhen the smoke
cleared, Light was out and Bud Ellis, independent, was
in . . Grapevine says it must have been because the
‘big Four. Phi Eps-Kaps-Game and the DTD’s, don’t
llike Light. After all, the PiKA head could call two
‘members of the executive board brother . . Grape-
vine says he doesn’t think that it’s an appeasement
policy on the part of prime minister Downie to quiet the
rearmed independents, although the fraternities will
try to use it as one.

nation went to war today for other
reasons than the defense of the coun-
try, the United States government
would find less than two ready vol-
unteers out of every ten college men.

A poll just conducted by the Stu-
dent Opinion Surveys of America
among the male collegians of the
nation reveals that although they
_may be winning to defend their coun-
try, it will take several good reasons
to make them volunteer for some
other form of Warfare.

No Future Predictions

The Survey does not attempt, of
course, to predict how many would
actually enlist under future circum-
stances, for it is possible that many
would act like a student interviewed
in one of the West Central states who
declared, “I might say now that I
won’t volunteer, but when the time
comes perhaps I’ll go anyway. It
will depend on the propaganda.”

Representative portions of the na-
tion’s student bodies, excluding wo-
question: “If the United States went
men, were interviewed with this
to war for other reasons than the de-
fense of the country, would you vol-
unteer?”

Those who said yes amounted
to 19.7 per cent; no’, 80.3 per cent.

Most of those who are willing had
reasons for their answers. Mention-
ed the greatest number of times were
“to perpetuate democracy,” and “to
make the Monroe Doctrine respect-
ed.” A good number also mentioned
that they were in the ROTC or the
National Guard and would have to
enlist. “To stop Fascism,” “to help
England or France,” “to protect
American property abroad,” “to keep
the balance of power”—those are
other reasons. And there were those
who would join any conflict, like the
Dartmouth sophomore who declared,
“I’d follow the U. S. anywhere——my
country right or wrong.” Opinions
from students on the opposite side
ran from mild comments on the fool-
ishness of war to emphatic state-
ments such as a Texas student’s “I’d
rather sit in jail than ﬁght in any
war.”

 

Falling slightly under the national
average, one of the few instances
when it has, the local results in the
Student Opinion Surveys voted neg-
atively 31 to 9 on the question
whether a student would volunteer
for other reasons than defense of the
country.

Well, bewhiskered G. B. Shaw has.
done what we’ve all been waiting for.
He has taken his brilliant spanking
dialogue of “Pygmalion” and infused
it with life by picking Leslie Howard
and Wendy I-Iiller to create his word
pictures.

English society, if it dares see the
picture, will get a mighty well-aimed
kick in its collectively “superior”
britches. For Shaw tells them that
all one need to do to obtain “social
prominence” is to acquire a superﬁ-
cial air of reﬁnement.

To prove this Leslie Howard, a
professor of phonetics, picks a cock-
ney flower girl, a “draggle-tailed gut-
‘ tersnipe,” a slut of the gutter, grooms,
educates, threatens, berates, cajoles,
until he is able to pass her off as a
“duchess” six months later at the
ambassador’s ball.

Dialogue overﬂowers with biting
satire and delicious comedy. To read
Shaw is pure enjoyment. To see his
work transferred to the screen is a
delight far above expectations.

Hockey Feud Breaks

Out Again

Tomorrow

As Pitt, Dukes Clash

Came First of Three Strenuous

Assignments In Eight Day Grind

By BILL MIC-ELVVAIN
The bitterest feud to hit Pittsburgh hockey, either college or pro-

fessional, in recent years reaches

the third stage of its development

tomorrow night when the Duquesne Dazzlers match goals and rough
stuff with the McSo1-ley Menace at Duquesne Garden.
Each team had been subjected to defeat only once up to last Fri-

day.

The Dukes took on \Yestern Reserve, western division leaders,

Friday evening at Cleveland, too late?

for the publication here of the result,
but it is probable that the Blufﬁtes
still have only one loss.

Since Duquesne won, it now
leads the eastern division with nine
victories for 18 points, while the
Panthers’ eight triumphs and a tie
put them one point behind the pace
setters.

‘Wild Games

Two previous Pitt—Duquesne clash-
es resulted in some of the wildest,
roughest hockey of the season, two
riots, and an even split in games won.
Early in the season, the Cathedral
six turned back the Dukes 2-1, but
a return game three weeks ago went
to Vance and Co., 2-0.

The Jungle Cats must win to keep
alive their hopes for the division
championship. Assuming that both
Duquesne and Pitt
win all their other
games, the Panth-
ers must take the
Dukes over at least
once in their next
two games and do
no worse than tie
in the other.

Tomorrow night’s
game marks the
beginning of an eight—day nightmare
in which Pitt will meet the Dukes,
John Carroll, and Western Reserve in
succession. Reserve has fallen before
the McCorleymen once this season
and should again, but Carroll will be
tough all the way. The Clevelanders
tied Pitt 2-2 in the season opener.

While previous performances mean
little in most Pitt-Duke athletic bat-
tles, the Dietrich-coached squad will
go into the game slight favorites,
chiefly because of the overwhelming
quality of their attack.

Vance Stars

Chief object of Pitt’s attentions to-
morrow evening will be Bill “Philo”
Vance, Duquesne’s tireless center who
currently holds the eastern sector’s
scoring lead. Offensively and defen-
sively, Vance is easily the ace of the
league.

Without the bespectacled Canadian,
the Dukes’ punch is well short of ter-
riﬁc and their de-
fense lines allow
men to sift in en-
tirely too often,
but with Vance,
the attack picks
up, the checking
becomes d e a d l y.
and the Dukes win
again.

 

Friday

Brittain

'1

 

Teamed on the front line with
Vance are Harry Foster and Walter
“Jazz” McGill. Foster is one of the
circ-uit’s underrated stars, although in
recent games he has pulled up be-
hind Vance to second place in scoring.

Good Record

Against Baldwin-Wallace recently,

whipped in four goals and an

~.ack on defense are Roger Schnei-
:'er and Ohla. Schaeffer, who cap-
tains the team, opened. the season as
a wing but, after  disappointing
:5t€.1‘t, went back on defense where he
has perforined capably. Ohla is a
rugged boy who bodychecks vicious-
ly.

In the goal mouth will be reformed
sailor Alex Eungerich, the goalie who
does everything wrong but is seldom
scored on. Only three times has the
goal light ﬂashed behind Alex, who
combines a fair amount of skill with
a high percentage of successful dare-
deviltry and downright luck.

Scully Plays

The Duquesne reserves, while not
such potent scoring threats as the
ﬁrst stringers, are guaranteed to pro-
vide plenty of excitement. The line
of Hansberry, Liebgott, and Dick
Scully, 27-year-old sophomore who
became eligible at mid semester, plays
w e l l enough in
front of defense-
men Fogarty and
Unger to take over
most of the loops ,
weaker outﬁts.

Hansberry a n d
Fogarty are both
hot heads wh o
participated in
hand-to-hand bat-
tles with B0\b
Schooley and Walt
Lovett in the ﬁrst two games, and a
recurrence of the hostilities is not
only possible but likely. A Schooley-
Hansberry fracas is particularly pro-
bable.

As for the Panthers, their lack of
sustained scoring ability has made
the starting lineup a matter of proba-
bilities rather than certainties.' Tay-
lor Brittain will probably go back to
a wing to work with Bob Schooley
and center Dick Friday on one line.

Two other lines combinations may
include Shiring and Broido or Lowe
:and Schildecker with Irv Artz
[shuttling back and forth between the
;two lines as center. Schildecker and

Schooley

J  Shiring are also scheduled for defense
" iduty in front of goalies Ellis as Pat

Cusick and reliable Walt Lovett.

Public Opinion

‘Big Ten? -— Who Cares?’ Answers
Average Pitt Man to Question

By BILL MAZEFSKY
Lately there has been a good deal of newspaper talk about Pitt ’s

entangling alliance with the Big

Ten and Major Grifﬁth and what

that alliance meant to Pitt’s athletic policy.

No one—1east of all Major Griﬂ'ith—has been able to dispel cer-
tain questions and impressions that have resulted from this confeder-
acy, and as a result this correspondent was sent on a pulse feeling

expedition by the News Sports de—9

partment.

What—if anything—does the av-
erage man in the Commons Room
think about the possibilities of Pitt
joining the Big Ten Conference. The
ﬁrst average gent was found in the
Tuck Shop putting away a sand-
wich.

Too Tired

When asked his opinion about Pitt
and the Big Ten, this unsociable per-
son ascertained our mission and then
flew into a rage. Ho refiused to com-
mit himself on the Pitt athletic poli-
cies because he was tired of all this
public opinion business.

With the Gallups, Fortune, Minute
and Sam Rosenberg
liounding the average man, the aver-

Interviews

age man doesn’t even have time to
eat a sandwich. He was sorry but he
was a refugee from public opinion
polls and therefore couldn’t answer
the question.

Wandering into the Panther office
we looked for a chunk of average
opinion but here, too, the mission
met with disaster. They refused to
give out opinions on the Big Ten-—

Pitt question, _ because. they.

above the average. Therefore, they
reasoned, their opinion was worth-
less. _

Our last attempt at attaining a slice
of average public opinion led us into
a freshman orientation class. This
was a bad move. The ﬁrst freshman
was a blank. He didn't know any-
thing about the Big Ten, or Pitt ath-
letics, or Major Griﬁith because the
orientation class had only reached
the dean of women’s office in their
studies.

Everything Good

The next freshman spoke freely. It
was his opinion that the Big Ten was
a good thing. He also thought that
Pitt athletics were a good thing. Into
this same category of good things he
tossed Major Grifﬁth, public polls,
Mrs. l‘.'iiller’s teas. and score of other
litems. He was clearly above the av-
icrage. so we advised him to join the
3 Panther staff.

 Since no poll  any good without a
‘blonde opinion, we sought the wis-
gdcm of the blonde. young lady who
lavas also being oriented. “Yes,” she
lisped, _"‘I would be glad to answer a

.- few questions about the Big Ten and _

Pitt athletics. But I never heard of
them, so I don’t think I’d better.
Don’t you think so.”

.....We thought so!

Freshman Coach Milligan

Joins Florida Grid Staff

\Valter Scott “Hike” ;\lilligan,**

freshmaii football coach and a
niember of the physical education
department and athletic eligibility
committee, last. Friday tendered
his resignation to the University,
and made known his acceptance of
the position of line tutor at the Uni-
versity of Florida, causing another
serious Gap in the Pitt coaching ranks.

He will succeed Dutch Stanley, who
has been head and assistant coach for
about six years. Stanley will trans-
fer his grid strategy to Duke Univer-
sity next season, as end coach. Carl
Voyles, whom Stanley replaces, goes
to William and Mary as head mentor.

Played ‘With Josh

Milligan ﬁrst received notice for
his football ability at Woodlawn (now
Alliquippa) high school. He gained
t.'u:'ti3er athletic prominence at Kiski
prep school in 1926 and 1927. \/like
played guard on Pit.t’s 1’reshman
eleven, Josh Williams, now
backﬁeld coach at Florida.

lvlilte and Josh just can’t get away
from each other. They not only
teamed up together in football dur-
ing their collegiate days, but
roomed together. Three years after
his graduation he returned to Pitt,
joining Dr. Sutherland’s staff of aides,
of which Williams also became a
member.

1\/Iilligan was one of the lightest
and speediest linemen in gridiron his-
tory here. While weighing only 170
pounds, he was a‘ member of the 1931
varsity which won the Eastern title,
and earned a place on the All~Eastern
team. He took part in only four los-
ing games in his three years of var-
sity competition.

Stressed Fundamentals

As freshman coach he employed no
fancy plays, but concentrated on
grounding his charges in the funda-
mentals as stressed by Head Coach
Sutherland. His ﬁrst year men al-
ways became so proﬁcient that they
regularly threatened experienced var-
sity players, and sometimes ousted
the older hands from startingberths.

In this manner his work caught the
attention of athletic directors of other
universities and colleges. He has had
several coaching offers in the past,
but consistently refused to consider
them, preferring to remain at his
alma mater, until this year.

Already mentioned as possible suc-
cessors to Milligan are two Panther
All—America backﬁeld stars——Frank
Patrick and Marshall Goldberg. Pat-
rick completed his undergraduate
term at Pitt the spring of 1937. Last
year he played fullback for the Chi-
cago Cardinals. Goldberg graduates
in June.

Milligan, at Florida, will ﬁnd him-
self lined up against three of his for-
mer football buddies—“Spike” Hard-
ing, Hart Morris and George Ormis-
ton, having played with Morris and

\V i ‘:3 1

coached Ormiston——when the Flori-

dians engage their keenest rival, Mi-
ami. The annual Florida-Miami tilt,
consequently, will be a test of Pitt
system versus Pitt system.

Johny Wood1°u.ff
Enters Hospital

Johnny Woodrutf, Pitt’s 800-meter
Olympic champion, entered the West
Penn hospital where he will spend
the next few days
taking physiother-
apy treatments and
resting up from a
leg injury suffered
in the Milrose
G a m e s in New

diagnosed as a

don and the gas-

He is expected to be kept out of
action for at least two weeks during
which time his place on the relay

ballers signed in today from their
Temple tussle at Philadelphia last
Saturday, for an "Eastern Conference
gaine with Elmer Ripley’s newly ac-
quired Georgetown Hoyas, at the
Stadium this evening.

Past performances of the Wash-
ington team this winter would indi-
]cate that the former Yale ﬂoor tutor
has an unsteady quint that appears
to be the most talented in the Con-
ference. The Hoyas have a respecta-
ble record, of three wins and one de-
feat. They received their lone dump-
ing from Carnegie Tech in a contest
that was undecided until the very
end.

The Capital City club’s regular ﬁve
is well balanced. McGowan, red-
headed, six—foot-four-inch sopho-
more center, displayed plenty of class
against the Tartans, and is a coming
star. He ﬁgures importantly in un-
der-the-basket scrambles for the ball
and does his share of point-making.

A frail but clever courtman, Kur-
tyka; midget race-horse dribbl.er,
Rissi; and veterans Schmidt and
Murphy, the latter the Hoyas’ lead-
ing scorer, represent Georgetown in
an interesting and successful style.

Dr. Carlson will probably rely on
the usual “glamour” team of Stral-

 

toona. Johnson.

the mood of the musicale.”

Victor to record Larry Clinton’s in-
terpretation of the songs and is mak-
ing arrangements with Vocalion,
Decca, and Brunswick to have their
