‘the place of that idea.” A

it, holding down ﬁrst , base for the
Boston«Red Sox who won the title by
defeating Pat Moran’s~ Philadelphia

team. Their line is a heavy one and
with Wray" and .'Dorizas- among them
is sure.,.to make a good account’ of
themselves. In fact it has not been
thru the line « that the touchdowns
have been scored against them, but
thru intercepted forward passes and
by blocked punts. -

V The- injury to Sutherland’ and the
declaration by the ‘Athletic Associa-
tion‘ that Reese is ineligible has tak-
en .two strong and experienced men
out of the line and out of the game
that we especially wish to win. ‘Suth-
erland may possibly be out to practice
this week, but is hardly tprobable
that he will be inlthe game Saturday.
It is hoped that the cause of Reese’s
ineligibility will be removed as the
big blond from Warren is one of the

. scrappiest and hardestplayin-g guards

that ever donned the moleskins for
old Uni. The announcement that

“‘Fox‘y” Miller will be on the side-

lines with a fractured leg for the‘
greater part of the season casts gloom
over the otherwise bright skies over
the Pitt camp. Without doubt Miller
is the best man for running interfer-
ence and ,is without a superior at tak-
ing the men out of the interference
and getting the man with the pigskin.
As previously agreed no Freshmen
will be allowed to represent Pitt in
the game Saturday. This will mean
that an entirely old Jteam {will be
compelled to take the ﬁeld. The loss
of such men as .Sies, Gougler, -Seidel,

.McNulty,~ Mc_Laren and the other

freshmen will be keenly felt.‘ But it
was an. entirely an all-letter team that
walloped the Navy week before last

, and our moueyis on the same eleven

warriors ‘again. The lineup at the
blow will probably ﬁnd Hastings
and DeHart at the halves, with Fry
at-the full back position. At quarter
there is no question about who will

-be seen directing the men as their

is only one “Chalky” Williamson.‘ Her-

ron and Carlson are ﬁxtureson the

wings.- Thornhill will hold down one
tackle while either Hilty, jclicquinnoi,
or Hockensmith will be in the other.
Soppitt at right guard and Bond, Shap-
iro,ior Reese will ﬂank Peck on the
other. -ie C

‘ Arr-angements have been made‘ for
the team to take a special train over
the Pennsylvania which will leave the
Union depot at 9:40 Friday ‘morning
and will arrive in Philadelphia. at 6
o’clock. A special train with special
rates will probably be run over the
Baltimore and «Ohio. This train will
leave Friday night and return Sun-
day. evening. . A stopover for Sunday
can be made inL«Philad,e1phia, Washing-

ment of this special train will be made

“If it was not for being labeled as an

of a half million on Glenn Warner‘

all up on thedope that Pitt wins all
it’s games» this year. -2 ‘

Fry was well enough to play. Sprain-

ed ligaments 1 and a bad charley horse

not to mention a slight attack of la
grippe were a few of the J obian a,ﬂilic-
tions of the plungung fullback. Well
he started to the game and those who
saw him need notbe reminded-of the
wonderful, irresistible brand of’ buck-

ing the line with which he tore the ’

Indian line ,up. Nosuch an exhibition
of line plunging has -been seen on this
ﬁeld for many agnoons. We wish Fry

if he could only -be sick (like he was ‘

Saturday), for all

Sies, the new man at guard, ‘made’
even the old timers open their eyes at
the dashing style of game he put up.
Time after time he broke through the
line and stopped the runner before
he had a chance to get started. The
Pitt line is rounding into shape fast
as is shown by thefact that the ’In-
dians never got within the ‘Blue and
Gold’s 25-yard. line.

Gougler, the Harrisburg star, had
his ﬁrst opportunity toshow his true
ability to the public. -Still suffering
from a bad leg, the blond halfback
played albangup game and scored 11
points while he was in the game. His
place kick from the .31 y.a.rd line went
squarely through, the center of the
poles -and his goal from touchdown
was also perfect.’ McNulty, the. old
Mercer-burg star, although in the ‘game
for only” a short time displayed the
form that made him a running mate
for Legone whenthey both played cg,
the Mercerburg’s ‘eleven.’ 2

A letter was received frame the
Sporting Editor of the daily paper at
the University of Pennsylvania ask-
ing for information. Among‘-other
things of little importance he wanted
to know the style of play that Eitt
would ‘ offer for the game Saturday
and who were the stars. The writer
informed him that he would be. better
able to judge the «style of game him-
self, after the game was over and as
torwho were the stars, he was refer-
red-.to the answer of a Philly scribe
when asked the same question, “Who-
were the stars?” (the was talking of
the Pitt men in the Pitt-Navy game
which he witnessed) “Why man, they
are all stars.” For conﬁrmation of
same we refer him to the teams that
have lined up against the Pitt boys
this year. I ‘i ‘L ‘

 Much was looke-d for from the In-
dian ucaptain Calac. His wonderful
playing. here last year «and the re-

‘portsofewhat he did to the Crimson

at Harvard made many of the follow-
ers of the Blue .and Gold dubious as to
the ‘result of the fracas. But time
after time the big fullback threw him-
self at the Pitt line only to be thrown

back for a loss or merely to gain a

few inches. The wonderful defenseof
the locals can be better realized
when one takes into account the fact
that the visiting team only made ﬁrst

down " three times during the entire ‘

game.

Coach Kerr's scrappy  band of

feat of the season at’ Saltsburg on

Saturday when Keck, Kiski’s demon~

boot-er, dropped back from his position
at tackle and kicked the spheroiddi-.
rectly between the» uprights from
placement on the 4.0Vyard line. -This
feat deprived the Freshmen of a score-
less tie, which would have given. more
light as to the -evenness of the teams.
Both” aggregations threatened to
score on several occasions but the de-
fense of each‘ team stiffened when
things became dangerous. Pitt’s first
year men gave the stellar exhibition
during the earlier sessions, but the
Saltsburg huskies came back in the
later periods to square matters and
what they accomplished was dierctly
due to the brilliant. feat. of Keck.

“Beginning with the academic year
19154917. no new student "will be
admitted to the Law School who has
11013 Spent at least two Years. in regu-
lar attendance upon the! undergradu-
ate courses of some reputable col-
lage.» V ,  . .

The above quotation is taken from
the new_ bulletin of the Law School
lust issued. It may be seen from
this that the Law School is Vmaki-ng
its entrance requirements harder and.
that the standard of the? school -is be-
ing ,raisedR.- ' A

‘It ‘is. interesting to note that, be-
ginning with .a faculty of three, 9, gm.
dellt body of twenty-ﬁve sand with
but R a two year course,‘ the Law

School has existed for some seventy-S

W9. Yea1‘$?and-is ‘now ranked with

,WRtl1e_‘VVbes.t lawschools ofthellcountry. A
Today it has afaculty of seventeen

members, a student body of over 175,’
and is -a member ofthe Association
of Ainerican Law Schools. R

In order to learn the real history

of the law school of the University,

it is necessary to go back at least
as far as 1843'.
was .beRfore_the ﬁre, it is impossible
to learn with accuracy the. date of
the establishment of the d:epRai~.tni-ent,
l)llt'~_it is evident that in that year it

was in existence, and that Hon. Wal-

ter,H. Lowrie, LL. D., was the .head
[of the department. In all probability
the department was,-in ﬂourishing ex-
istence from 1843, and perhaps ear-
lier, until the work of the’University
was temporarily discontin_uedR‘ in /1849.
When work was resumed in 1855 it
.seems that this departmentnwas not
revived. V’ . 2 i

In 1870 another attempt was made
to establish a law department. The
catalogue. of that year contains ‘the.
name of William Bakewell as pro-
fessor. of equity, jurisprudence and

constitutional law; Hill Burgwin, pro- R

fessor of real estate, practice and
pleading; .W. T. Haines, professor of
criminal and commercial law. The
catalogue also issues a prospectus of
the law school, which provided" for a
course of two Years, designed Rto
qualify students i’orI_thet practice of

of Rfour'and one-half months each. V.
In as much as the catalogue of the
following year makes no‘ mention of
the law ‘school, the inference is that
thelectures were discontinud.‘

It was not until, October, 1895,»that—

the Pittsburgh -Law School was or-

ganized and lectures were actually...

given as «a department of the* Uni-
versity. Previous to this time a con-
siderable number of students in other
law schools throughout the country
gave indication of their willingness
to enter the law department should
one be organized at the University.
This» was suﬂicient indication that
such a schoolcould notfail of suc-
cess. . ‘ R

Accordingly theiUniversity took ac-
tion, with the result that courses
covering two years were oifered, and
the institution was ﬁnally opened for
the instruction of students. The
number the ﬁrst. year. was thirty-ﬁve.
“Elie .temporary use" of the rooms in
the Allegheny Court, House was

kndly tendered by the =Commi_ssiVon-RR

ers of Allegheny County. Almost im-
mediately after V the work was done
the law faculty took steps to have
the courts raise the course to three
years. 1 R ' R R

The

'1 dean of the department from

the beginning has been Hon. John «D:

Shafer, whose reputation, both‘ as
lawyer and judge of the (Common
Pleas Court, is widely extended over
the state. ‘Until his death ’inR191O,
Thomasyﬂerriott was with the Law
School from ‘its foundation. Other
members of the faculty from-the be-
ginning until now, are James C. Gray,
Vice‘ Dean; Ho-ii. Samuel S. Me:liard,.
and Wm. H. *McClung,R Esq;

The department has had a high de-
rgre~ of prosperity, and its reputa-
tion as a thorough school of law has
extended far beyond the boundaries
of Pennsylvania. It has had the
unique experience of sending a class
into a state examination, every mem-

~ her -of which has successfully passed,

while at least ﬁfty Der cent. of the
total number V. at such examination
failed to pass. _ . 1
Little effort is made to secure a
large body of students. Evcryeffort
is nm-ade to see to it that the instruc-
tion is of the ablest character and
that the,-work-of the students comes
up .to the highest ‘possible standard.
R°The enrollment of the law school
has increased Yearly. and thus far
this year more than 175 students have
registered. By the adoptionof the
new two year rule the law school will
practically become ‘a graduate school.
Formerly a student could enter. for
the studiy of law either by passing the
preliminary examinations orby pre-
senting a- college deg'1‘ee- NOW only
