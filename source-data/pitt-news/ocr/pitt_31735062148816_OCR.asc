Port pitches N ewmans
to 9-0 win over Samlnies

xlndependent champions
to face SAM-Oil and Gas

winner in title contest

Newman Club, Independent
league crown bearer, added an-
other victim to its long and im-
pressive undefeated record \Ved-
nesday afternoon by shutting out
the fii-ateriiity champions, Sigma
Alpha Mu, 9-0.

Led by Red Port"s four-hit pitch-
ing and brilliant play by both the
inﬁeld and the outfield, the New-
n‘-ans looked) like a real champion-
ship nine.‘ As a result of their
victory Wednesday, they will be
pre--game favorites for their ﬁnal
contest today against the winner of
the SAM-Oil & Gas ti?t.

Thirteen ‘ Strikeouts

Sammie Lou l\/Iondlow while giv-
ing: three-hits and striking "out 13
men, was not in his usual form. for
walks kept him in a hole every
inning. With frequent errors b6-
hind him in critical rnoments it
was too great an obstacle to over-
come. ' ~

The Newmans took an early lead
as they put together a walk, a
double by. Charley ;’i;.acek, and a
sacriﬁce« ﬂy to" score two runs.

Throughout the second, third,
and fourth innings the defensive
‘strength of the eventu-.—.l'winners
became’ apparent. , Jimmy Klein,
Charley Ptacek‘, and Ersil Castelio
formed the crack-proof Newman
inﬁeld. ,

Superb‘ Pitching

on the SAM_side, catcher Mes.
Kaplan and c'enterﬁelder Red Sil-
verrnan repeatedly made “impos-
sible” catches. but to no avail.

: The three" innings were quickly
over,‘a‘s superb pitching by Port and
Mcndlow cut down most of the bat-
ters on strikeouts.

Then came the storm, as loose
play on the” part of ‘The’ Gre=ks
gavegthe Newrnans two runs in the
fifth inning. Both tallies were un-
earned, two walks and two errors
being all that was needed.

In the sixth inning the Newman

Registrar gives
lab exemption
cards today

University students who have not
yet obtained cards exempting them
from the laboratoryfees can do so
today at the Registrar’s office, 1817
Cathedral.

Cards may be obtained next week
but the registrar’s oﬁice asks that
as many students as possible call
for cards by 5 o’clock today.

Exemption can be claimed only
by retaining the card and present-
inglit to the cashier at registration.

Nothing deﬁnite has been dec.id-
ed as to the steps taken if the card
is lost. Students can be assured,
it was stated, that misplacement of
cards will cause complicated pro-
ceedings at registration to validate
exemption.

The purpose of issuing the cards
conforms with the plan to prevent
rctroaction, for the fees and tuition
changes will affect. only incoming

freshman an_d transfer students.

The“ additional revenues will be
used to _improve' laboratory facili-
ties and'.bear'~ part of ' the cost of

Class continues
soliciting funds
for memorial

Chairman coinmends
response, requests
delinquent pledges

The Senior Memorial Committee
has been enlarged to include more
prominent seniors who have agreed
to assist the original committee in
soliciting for funds to build the
medallion casement windows, sen-
ior gift to the University.

At a meeting Wednesday, leaders
in all. phases of University activ-
ities were asked to join the com-
mittee by Tom Halloran, - BA,
chairman.

New committee members whose
pockets will bulge with pledge
cards include: Robert C. Adams, C,
Pat Cusick, C, Patricia Elmer, C,
Glenda Fitch, Ed, Mary Gregg, C,
Marjorie Kuhbach, C, Bill Edmunds,
E,'Jack Hoeveler, C, Jim Kennedy,
C, Morton Weissman, BA, Clarence
Shepard, BA, and Dick VVeiss, C.

The response has been greater
than previous years, reveals Hal-
loran, but more money‘ is needed.

Seniors who have lost the pledge
cards mailed to them may obtain
cards from the dean of men’s of-
ﬁce, 809 Cathedral, or members of
the committee.

Personal contact, Halloran be-
lieves, will acquaint seniors with
the importance of contributing to
the fund for the memorial stained
glass medallion windows to be built
in the alcove overlooking Lilly
Court.

“The most convenient method to

contribute to the senior memorial,” '

says lg-Ialloran, “is to sign the pledge
cards which were mailed and the

sum promised will be deducted-V

from the cap and gown refunds.”

Pitt needs
a literary mag

These past t'ew dziys, in which came the an-
nounceinent that two hail
placed first and fourth re.~:pectivel_v in a nation-wide
collegiate poetry contest. I>rouglit to our attention
the crying need for :1 literary publication here at
Pitt.

\Vh_en the Joumeyniaii dis-.1ppea1'ed from cam-
pus, the last outlet. for literary talent at the lini-
versity vanished. Reasons for its extinction were
given as 1) the f2I.('i that any such publication
would reﬂect. back on the Eiiglisli departinent, and
2) the expense of the venture.

VVith one of the ﬁiiesrt, if not the best. English
departments in the country, there is no justification
for the ﬁrst claim. If the results of the at'o.re-
mentioned poetry contest are not enough, the
point is reinforced by the words of ‘Wliit Burnett,
editor of Story, a New York “quality” magazine,
who has remarked on the fact that COIlSlSIt.‘IlIl_\‘,
year after year, Pitt should turn out a crop of men
who could write, and write well.

To bring harsh statistics into the realm of edi-
torial fancy, the inaxiinum cost of printing another
Journeyman would come to $100. C‘am.pus dances
have lost more. A

The project would be justiﬁed if only in the
light of the fact that the postage expanded by stu-
dents submitting to professional niagazines would
more than pay for the piilﬂication.

Warlines . . .

Faculty member wants us
to avoid ‘vast mistake’

I believe that the war is a vast mistake, as almost
everyone does, I think.

I believe that our best service to our country, to
Europe and to the World can be rendered only if we
keep out of the war. We can by no possibility stop the
slaughter. We can prolong it, adding our thousands to
their thousands, our passions and terrors to theirs. I
believe that nothing, NOTHING could make that a wise
choice of action.

I believe that we have done wrong and are doing
wrong to furnish war materials and bombing gasoline
to destroy the Finns, the Chinese, etc., whose destruc-
tion we deplore.

I believe we are in no danger of being invaded.
Neither Japan nor Germany could land an army to fol-
low up a bombing raid upon us. Without that, an air
raid would be futile. Countries already ruined by war
will not attack us I believe. They could not if they
would?

I believe that the Almighty “has set his canon”
against killing, and that one thing is worse than to be
slaughtered and that is to slaughter.

Therefore, I believe that we, any of us or all of us
have no right to require of our young men to be
slaughtered and to slaughter-—for “Thou shalt not kill.”

I believe that a new philosophy is being born in
the World, very slowly, but irresistably, and that it will
in time prevail and make war impossible. It is new,
in that it is beginning to be applied in many, as it
always has been in a few minds, to public and inter-
national affairs. It has long prevailed among indi-
viduals—certain individuals. It is based upon the con-
viction that it is always better to solve our differences
by the use of our heads than by the use of our bodies
-—-when that philosophy wins the day among us, we
shall be free Americans.

VVar knows no victor

Monday morning's paper carried a banner pageline
that Prime Minister Churchill predicts a victory for
the Allies.

Again the word victory is used with reference to
how many men one nation can kill. Victory? What
kind of victory? The sort of victory that little boys
achieve after they have been playing a game. The
sort. of victory that we have to show after so many
years of civilization.

I’ve pinned more men with bayonets than you have.
I’ve destroyed more schools and churches than you
have. My prison camps stink worse than yours do.
Victory.

Churchill said, “Mastery can only be regained by a
furious and unrelenting assault.” Is this the kind of
mastery that the world wants to maintain? Mastery
that can be gained only by the death of thousands of
boys, millions of boys, boys who ha\'r*“’t even ‘had a
chance to live‘? Is this the mastery that mankind has
been striving to achieve?

Or is not mastery rather to be deﬁned as the con-
quest of the elements about us, using those forces for
the betterment of man. Is not mastery the conquest
and the improvement of science, the rapid progress of
civilization toward a more balanced society, jobs for
the unemployed, more opportunities for youth coming
out of the schools.

Just like little boys playing. Now, I’ll set so many
soldiers up here, and you set so many up over there.

And we’ll let them shoot at each other until they’re
all dead. But here the little boys do their elders one
better. After the tin soldiers are all dead, they pick
up the prostrate men from the living-room rug, and
set them on the ﬁeld of battle again. And they have
fun.

Their elders, however, play at their morbid diver.-
sion. look over rows of crosses, and then realize that it
wasn't much fun.—G. S., C42. V

Great Britain and France will not stop . . . let alone

as an American, I am unalterably opposed to the U.

legislation and honest, efﬁcient administration, business-
will swing upward and unemployment will disappear.

Someone is bound to say now, that we will be ‘un-
able to import sufﬁcient rubber and other raw materials
if we let the rest of the world go hang. So what?’
We’ll drive a few less automobiles and save a few more
lives. A little old-fashion living might do us some
good.-—S. S. K., C401/3.

Seismologist
gets no report
of ‘war-quakes’

To some 80 persons who have
asked Donald Bradford, University
seismologist whether his seismo-
graph is recording German bombs,
his deﬁnitely negative answer is
that his department hasn’t been re-
ceiving the usual European seis-
mological reports by mail because
of the war.

Mr. Bradford remarked that Dr.
Vincent W. Lanfear, dean of men,
was the seventy-eighth person who
asked him if the effects of the blitz-
krieg attacks were being reported.

About four or ﬁve earthquakes
are recorded by the seismograph
each week, but only one out of ten
are strong enough to study. This
month has shown quite a bit of ac-
tivity in comparison with other
months, especially January and
February which showed hardly any
earthquake activity.

In the mail

Student lauds co-ops,

enumerates examples
Editor, The Pitt News:
In your editorial concerning the

SFA report last Wednesday, you

suggested that SFA investigate stu-
dent co-operative cafeterias and
book stores. I heartily agree with
your suggestion, not only because
there is a great need for student-
owned cafeterias, book-store, and
housing projects, but because co-
ops have been extraordinarily suc-
cessful on other camps:

Where the demand for co-ops has
come from the students and where
the administration has co—operated,
they have been extremely popular.
Student-owned projects have been
operating at 100 per cent capacity,
expanding terriﬁcally in member-
ship and facilities, at schools like
Harvard, California, Michigan,
Texas A. & M., Washington, Penn
State, Wisconsin, and dozens of
others.

At California, for instance, a
fourteen member co-op grew in six
years to 600 members. Living costs
for students have tbeen cut by one-
third at Berkley. Michigan’s co-op
started with seven students living
in a cellar. Now, eight houses, cafe-
terias, etc., are student-owned.

A handful of students living in a
haunted house began Texas A. &
l\/[.’s 1,000—member co-op. Idaho,
Harvard, Penn State, and the Uni-
versity of California at Los An-
geles all show the same thing———sav-
ings of 20 per cent to 60 per cent of
the cost of going to college.

Other beneﬁts besides money sav-
ings have been gained through co-
ops. Student life on various campi
has been enriched by low-cost rec-
reation and co-operative education.
An intensive program of inexpen-
sive dances, exchange dinners, ral-
lies, smokers, intramural sports,
forums and study groups, tourna-
ments and festivals, and a host of
similar activities has brought real
college life to the reach of the av-
erage student at schools where co-
ops ﬂourish.

Large» money savings, richer, ful-
ler college 1ife——these are the ben-
eﬁts co-ops have brought to many
colleges. It seems to me, therefore,
that the possibilities of co-ops at
Pitt should be given the utmost
consideration. '

Sidelines

  With Bill McElwain _._, 

Sports Editor

Putting out a sports page requires a great deal more than
dashing off a. few stories, slapping on some headlines, and sitting

back to watch the readers go by.

Chief of the requireinents is co-operation from all those with

whom any member of the sports staff comes in contact.

This in-

cludes coaches, athletes, newspapermen, school officials, and a great

many others.

Rather than spout forth gems of wisdom similar to

those we have emitted all year. we intend to ﬁll today ’s column with
our personal thanks to those who have helped the Pitt News sports

staff during 1940-41.

Heading the list is Frank Carver, who dishes out athletic pub-

licity, secure in his Trees Gym

stronghold where no one ever

heckles him. A measure of our thanks to this department is re-
served for Bill McJunkin, Carver’s partner in crime (spelled

s-t-0-o-g-e).

While still in Trees Gym, we must proclaim our obligation to

director of athletics Jim Hagan.

We are indebted to Mr. Hagan

for his aid, for his encouragement, for his reliability as a news
source, and for free trips he gave us to Fordham and Penn State

last fall.

Jim Potts is up on the hill, too. Jim is the major-domo of the
intramural department and with his right hand man, Ollie Stiﬁ‘,
he has provided us with all intramural information.

In the coaching division we give a nod in the direction of
Charley Bowser, Carl Olson, Doc Carlson, Doc Zehfuss, Ralph
Mitterling, Ben Grady, Art Underwood, Dave O’Loughlin, Nick
Kliskey, Bob Hoel, et al, without whose help the News sports page
could not have been printed, chieﬂy because the afore-named were
more or less responsible for the existence of the teams News sports

writers wrote about.

Up in the athletic ofﬁce we had several other less-publicized

pals.

To Walter Good, Walter Ridley, Ken George, and the “beau-

tiful-and-not—so-dumb” trio of Mary Adele, Priscilla, and Evelyn,
we say thanks for standing up under our pestering.

The three downtown dailies contributed a few more allies.

For

various and sundry reasons, such as the loan of cuts, exchange serv-
ice on sports events coverage, etc. we are indebted to Fred Lan-
ducci, Claire Burcky, and Stubby Beachler of the Press; Harry
Keck and Tom Hopkins of the Sun-Telegraph; and Jack Sell of the

Post—Gazette.

This about concludes the list.

out, we are sorry.

If there is anyone we have left

Our thanks to them is none-the-less sincere.

And with this column, we also say “so long until next year” and

thanks for reading.

Pitt trackers odds-on favorites
to capture fifteenth from Temple

There is little possibility that
Temple University will foil the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh’s attempt for
its third straight season and ﬁfteenth
straight meet without defeat in dual,
triangular or quadrangular track
competition at tomorrow’s battle on
the Owl’s home grounds in Phila-
delphia.

Consequently, the Pitt News prog-
nosticator, who called the Michigan
score on the nose and hasn’t been
wrong on the winner in two years,
sees the Panthers winning 103-28.
This score represents a runaway
meet, but Temple has nothing but
a hurdler and a broad and high
jumper.

Tomorrow’s battle will mark the
ﬁnal dual test for ﬁve seniors: Frank
Ohl, Al Ferrara, Johnny Bazyk, Bob
Sulkowski, and Allen McKee. This
quintet of star performers will have
never participated in a losing con-
test in four years of freshman or
varsity, competition. Starting" with
freshman meets in 1937 when they‘
won nine dual tests, four in 1939,
and ﬁve in 1940 including tomor-
row’s encounter, they will have com-
peted on 21 consecutive winning
combinations.

Tomorrow may not be their ﬁnal
triumph, however, for they will have
the opportuhity of winding up their
careers in a blaze of glory by lead-
ing the greatest of Pitt teams to the
University’s second ICAAAA cham-
pionship, and its ﬁrst since 1937.,

The joust in Philadelphia tomor-
row should serve more as a tuneup
for the ICAAAA’s than anything
else, and little trouble is expected
from the eastern squad.

As the outcome of the meet leaves

Women to celebrate
Junior day Monday
with traditional "tea

Junior day with its traditional
farewell tea and gold ribbons will
be celebrated Monday by the class
of 1941 in 1217 Cathedral from
three until ﬁve o’clock, reveals Vir-
ginia Halen, C, and Mary Lewis,
C, co-chairmen.

Final social event of the year,
the program will include distribu-
tion of the class paper, exhibition
of the scrapbook, music by Mi-
riam Goldstein, C, and other class
musicians, and refreshments.

Members of the tea committee
include Letitia Hamilton, Ed; Jean
Geib, C; Pearl Hilsenrath, C; Vir-
ginia Vinnedge, BA; Eleanor Euwer,
Ed; Dorothy Thompson, Ed; Min-
nie-Maude Hunt, C; Matilda Kam-
ber, Ed; Rose Mary McGowan, Ed;
Claire Newlon, C: Beth Hughes, C;
and Mathilda Helfgott, C.

little room for debate, chief inter-
est will be centered on the attempts
of Johnny Bazyk and Joe Newman
to lower University marks in the
discus and high hurdles, respective-
ly. .

Bazyk seems determined to smash
the discus mark, for he hurled the
platter past Gibby Welch’s standard
of 147 feet three times in practice
last Wednesday. His three tosses
sailed 147 feet six inches, 148 feet,
and 151 feet. Any throw like this
in the ICAAAA will enhance Pitt
chances for victory. .

Newman has been hovering near
Kenny Ryden’s old standard of 15
seconds in the high hurdles all year,
but never reached it with the watch
timing him. Tomorrow, Newman
must travel in record ﬁgures to win,
for Temp1e’s outstanding" contest-

ant, Jimmy Smith turned in 14.9

last Saturday.

Del Anderson’_s first competitive
mile tomorrow should also provide
interest, for the junior star ran
4234.8 last Tuesday in the ﬁrst race
of his career at twice his usual test.

N etters topple
Grove City, 6-3

Pitt’s tennis team closed out the
season last Wednesday with their
second win of the year over Grove
City, downing the Grovers, 6-3.

Joe Kristufek, playing his ﬁnal‘
match for the Blue and Gold, lost
to Beaver county ace George Mc-
Closkey, 7-5, 9-7, after beating the
Grover luminary three times before.
Ed Goehring tripped Hulton, 6-3,
9-7, and Dudley Weiss defeated
Gilles, 9-7, 6-3, but Frank Gaenger
lost to Westergreen, 7-5, 6-0.

In the number ﬁve singles, Bob
Martin continued his ﬁne play, tak-
ing Gillen, 6-1, 6-2. Bob has the
best average of any performer on
the squad this year. Bob Nickeson
took McDowell, 6-1, 6-0, in the last

In the doubles, McCloskey and
Hulton edged Kristufek and Goehr-
ing, 8-6, 1-6. 9-7; Weiss and Gaenger
nosed out Gilles and Weidler in a
terrifﬁc three set engagement, 10-8,
5-7, 7-5; and Martin and Nickeson
easily blasted Gillen and McDowell,
6-2, 6-3.

show by completely bat: ng around
and driving Mendlow from the box.
Failure to locate the plate was
Mendlow’s weakness, with four
walks, a double by Hairy Strawn,
and two errors producing the ﬁnal
ﬁve runs.

The Sigma Alpha Mu’s invinci-
bility was just another rumor tc
the Newman boys in their big zu-
ning. Strawn, one of the outstand-
defensive stars in the independent
division of intramural ranks, hit a
clutch double to drive in three runs
during the rally.

Port was the outstanding indi-
vidual on the ﬁeld, helping his
own cause with two singles. He
will take the mound again for the
final game today at 4 o’clock.

For the losers Mendlow, although
rather ineffective Wednesday be-
cause of wildness, hit a double in
addition to his three-hit hurling.

The engineering league title hold-
er, Oil & Gas, suffered an early
loss in the playoff last Tuesday
when the Newman Club came from
‘geiiind in the last inning to win,

The Oilers surprised everyone
by extending the highly favorer
Newmans, for the engineering
league race had been a Walkaway.

Port again took the bill for the,
independents, and pitching his usual
consistent brand of ball, gave up
five scattered hits. Mike Sekela
pitched ﬁne ball until the last in-
ning splurge by the Newmans,
when they scored two runs on three
hits.

Castello, veteran Newman sec-
ond baseman, led the attack on Se-
kela by punching out two doubles
to drive in four runs. Bill Brown,
leftﬁelder for the victors, did his
bit in the victory with two singles.

Tank candidates

Varsity swimming coach Ben
Grady gets his ﬁrst glimpse of his
1940-41 tank squad this afternoon.

He has issued a call for all can-
didates for the 1940-41 team to re-
port at Trees pool at 4 o’clock to-
day. The meeting will be routine,
but Grady warns that all those in-
tending to try out for next year’s
team must attend.

Bill Reilly and Homer McClin-

trary to Pitt News golf stories and
as their fellow-students have
pointed out, Reilly and McClin-

went to Pitt, 7 and 5..

Pitt took three on the next four-
some as Seybold downed Moel, 5

best ball, 3 and 2.

Grove City took its second point
on the next foursome when Collwall
defeated Jack Glenn, 3 and 1. Jim
Rees took Glass, 2 and 1, and Pitt
again won the best ball, 2 and 1.

Pitt will attempt to even its rec-
ord against the nation’s armed forces
after dropping a 13-8 decision to
Navy last week.

In their last start the Army nine
was handed one of their worst beat-
ings in recent history when they
lost to Fordham, 15-7. The game
with the Panthers will mark the
last contest for the Cadets prior to
their “momentous” match with the
Navy.

Big Ben Kish probably will at-
tempt to capture his second win of
the year for the Mitterlingmen.
Guy Guadagnino will manage the
catching chores which he wrested
from George Hartman earlier in the
season.

Before the Panthers can defeat
the Soldiers, they must thrash out

Alumni Review reports increase
in membership, dues income

_ Statistics published in the May issue of the Alumni Review reveal
that although the "19‘4o'budget is less than 50 per cent of 1937-38 peak of
$28,000, and alumni salaries are but one-third of the average over
the seven-year period from 1933 until the present, the membership and

dues income ﬁgures are above av-
erage.

The Association report stated that
recent appropriation
momentarily’, weakened its". effec-
tiveness, but. that the. condition has
been remedied. Lack of funds pre-
xented the“ Association from con-
ducting ‘an expensive membership
drive, the ,rep,or_t _continued, al-
though a paid membership consti-
tuting 12.2 per cent‘ of a potential
alumni body of 27,000 is higher
than the average national member-
ship of nine per cent.

Named to positions as‘ reunion
chairman for their respective class-
es were Harold Viehman, assistant
se-cretary of the YMCA, ’39; Miss
Frances McLaughlin, assistant dean
of women, ’35; and Endicott Batch-
elder, assistant registrar, ’30, ac-
cording to an announcement in the
reunion bulletin of the Review.

Arther, ’17, chairman of the board
of Pittsburgh "V academy, presented
their respective views as to the
purpose and value of business ad-
ministration‘ training.

Dean Tippetts regards the college
of liberal arts as" the cornerstone
of an educational structure and
pointed tothat fact as the reason,
why professional schools guard
against too narrow a training by
requiringa certain number of. arts
courses as a prerequisite to grad-
uation. Here, the School of Busi-
ness Administration requires two
years of English and a year of po-
litical science, and encourages the
student to follow other electives.
