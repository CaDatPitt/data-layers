Wherein The Future
OF Diplomacy Comes
To Question . . .

JOSEPH McCLOSKEY

Last week, in his “quaran-
tine speech” at‘ Chicago, Pres-
ident Roosevelt made history.
He clearly denionstratecl that
the Japanese aggression 111
China affects every nation and
that no nation can maintain a
strictly isolationist position in the
face of such breaches of inter-
national etiquette.

Stimulated by the President’s
speech, the League of Nations has
shown some of the energy which
attended her condemnation of
Italy during the Ethiopian crisis,
futile as that condemnation prov-
ed.

Now the members of the league
are willing to stand by and per-
mit the United States to take the
lead in remonstrating with Japan.
However, they will have to give
the American State department
deﬁnite assurance that the United
States will not ﬁnd itself in a sit-
uation comparable to the embar-
rassing plight of Secretary Stim-
son in 1932, when the leading Eu-
ropean nations withdrew the fangs
from their declarations to Japan,
and, in effect, gave her a free
reign in Manchuria.

Situation An Outgrowth

The present situation is a direct
outgrowth of the success of the
Japanese venture in 1932. And
that success could have been pre-
vented had the British foreign of-
ﬁce wholeheartedly supported
Secretary Stimson.

Still another question arises now
that there is a deﬁnite probability
of cooperation between the United
States and the “peaceful” nations
of Europe.

Are Russia, England, and France
motivated by a desire to secure a
powerful (and wealthy) ally to
support them in the next world
war?
estly motivated by a desire to
guarantee world peace by the for-
mation of so strong an alliance as
to scare all the war-desiring
nations?

In other words, is there a possi-
bility that we, in the twentieth
century, are to be treated to such
a desirable state of affairs as a
Soviet - Anglo - American Peace
comparable ‘to the Pax Romana,
the device by which the Roman
Empire maintained internal peace
in her vast holdings over a period
of more than three centuries?

Or is the very suggestion too
naive?

Forum Speaker Asks
Japanese Sanctions

Pleading for American adoption
of economic sanctions against
Japan, Dr. Chi’ao Tin Chi, Chinese
economist, declared in his address
at Inquiry Forum Monday that “a
second world war” may result
from the Sino—Japanese conﬂict.

“If Japan succeeds in her war
of conquest against China, other
aggressive nations will see the
way open to ﬁght for their aims.
And America will be so affected
by any great war that she could
not maintain an isolationist policy
indeﬁnitely,” Dr. Chi said.

Immediate discouragement of
Japanese imperialistic ambitions
by a combination of the great
powers will serve, Dr. Chi be-
lieves, to halt the spread of itner-
national anarchy which began

with the Japanese invasion of
Manchuria in 1931, and has con-
tinued in Ethiopia, Spain, and the
present Chinese war.

“China greatly appreciates the
attitude taken by President Roose-
velt in his Chicago speech,” said
Dr. Chi. “He served notice on
the world that the United States
intends to take a responsible part
in securing world peace.”

While China expects no foreign
military aid, declared the speaker,
she will eventually win the pres-.
ent ﬁght largely through a col-.
lape of the Japanese economic
structure. Guerilla tactics which
the Chinese must adopt against
the invaders will become more
effective as the Japanese advance

Journalistic history was made last Wednesday when
a little messenger of truth and sourgrapes, a
“Bird,” ﬂapping its wings joyously in new—found
Liberty and Freedom, came to rest on Cathedral
Walk. For just a little bird, the flurry it raised
was quite remarkable. Why, even the coeds had
slightly rosy cheeks and one aesthetic looking
professor looked down his nose through his bi-
focals at an -elevator full of our great American
youth to remark that he had at last discovered the
cause of the peculiar odor in the -elevators . .
it came from no less a source than the slightly
tainted pages of -the messenger himself.

Overheard at the Pitt training ground for the fu-

Dear Calamity:

the women present,” said she,

Which bring us to this:
a lady? Does she wear velvet and
jewels with becoming grace? Is
she well versed in the contempor-
ary bon mots? Is she a lady if she
balances a teacup with delicacy
and precision? Or is she not a
lady if such are not among her
accomplishments? Does the wear-
ing of gingham or tatters bar one

“You don’t know how terrible
it is to have a name like mine,”
says Betsy Ross, C41.

For her, introductions are an
ordeal. “Betsy Ross is my name,”
she says, which brings the *-retort,
“Mine’s George Washington, kid,”
or “You keep your age well.” ‘

U. s. Government under‘ the’

Archives Department, Louis. W.
Johnston, instructor in political
science and former representative
of ‘the Archives division, related
yesterday.

Though empowered with. the»

authority of seeing all documents
relevant to government affairs,
many federal officials, especially
Circuit Court judges, refused to
allow the inspection of their rec-
ords, and practically all court
clerks objected‘ to any purusal of
them-not even acknowledging
the existence of such a. federal or-
ganization. , .
“My hardest problems,” Mr.
Johnston added, “was trying ‘to
save and salvage records submerg-

ed in the. ﬂood waters here at .

Pittsburgh. I was requested to

destroy most, but many an im-' .

portant record was gone over and
cleaned, then carefully ﬁled away
at Washington.”

Very valuable indeed, to those‘

who seek proof.of certain histor-
ical and past signiﬁcant events.
says Mr. Johnston, .is'the ﬁling
and preservation of these rec-
ords. To the fulﬁllment of this
service, the federal government
has, fortunately in our early his-
tory, created this department,
which today is manned by an ef-

_ﬁcient force of experts and sis .

housed 1 in a brand new marble
building located in Washington.

“Here,” ‘he continued, “millions
of old records are kept. Treaties
of peace, declarations of war, orig-
inal drafts of legislation--all com-
bine. in serving. as concrete evi-
dence in the every step of our rep-
resentative officials. They are
yours. Look at them when you
will. The records of ‘democracy
are always open.”

An amusing incident connected‘

with the Archives Department, re-
ports the former investigator," his
the present inner war between the
Department and the Congressional
Library. Especiallybuilt into the
wall of the newsquarters is a case

made to holdthel original copy“ of

the Constitution. The Congres-
sional Library, which at present
has the copy, refuses to yield it to
the Archives division.

And so today, sightseers, upon
entering this historic building, see
an empty case - under which is
emblazened in gold letters: “The
Constitution of the United States.”

Mr. Johnston has taken over
the duties of Dr. Roger Shumatef
who left the University to accept
an associate professorship at the
University of Nebraska.

Some of the mystery and lore of the Far East has been

These people burn red envelopes

Red, of course, is used because it is
symbolic of good fortune, content-
ment, and cheer.

When the Chinese want a fruit-

on the altars of gods, supplicating
them to be kind and merciful. On
the New-Year they pay homage to
their ancestors by burning cere-

Since the Oriental believes pro-

in time of mourning. Here it has
a spiritual signiﬁcance in guiding

Fordham L

Favored
Saturday

Experts Rank
Rams Above
Panthers

“We will be the underdog for
the ﬁrst time this season when
we play Fordham on Saturday,”
said Dr. John B. Sutherland as!
he started up to the practice ﬁeld
Monday afternoon to begin his
weekly cram course.

Sutherland was referring to the
opinions that have already been
given out by the so-called grid-
iron savants in the big city. They
have deﬁnitely placed the Rams
in the favored position.

And there is strong substantia-
tion for this belief. Fordham, al-
ways a stout defensive outﬁt, has
begot a powerful scoring punch
this year. Against Franklin and
Marshall, they scored 66 points
and Saturday, playing Waynes-
burg, the Crowleymen defeated
the Jackets by 21 points more
than the Dukes did.

LINE STRONG ‘

The starlwarts of last year’s
“seven blocks of granite” still
form the foundation for the Ford-
ham line. They- include tackles‘
Albert Barbartsky and Edmund
Franco and All-American center
Alexander Wojciechowicz.

All other factors being equal,
may we remind you that Fordham
will be played on the ‘one Satur-
day in the football year that is
anathema to the Panthers. It is
the fourth game on the Panther
card. This is the game Pitt has
formed a habit of losing in the
past four years.

Reviewing the Duke contest, Dr.
‘Sutherland delivered a lengthy
"lecture on what is wrong with
Pitt football Monday. Chief in
the list of his complaints is the
poor selection of plays. ,

Sutherland was all but satisﬁed
with the other features of the
‘Pitt play.” Blocking‘ was not
-clean-cut throughout "the game
and the team lacked “a sturdy
defense.”

According to Frank Altmar,
"team trainer, the squad came out
of the Duquesne gam‘e'in_ better
"physical shape than they came out
of any game this year, Bill Dad-
-dio is st-ill suffering from a "pulled
muscle in his leg, : an injury‘ he
"has had since the first ’ga'me,'but
even that is in better condition.

Program

Director
Announces
Playing Rules
By BOB ANGROS
Unless Harvey Rooker, director
of intramural athletics, is roughly
sidetracked in his determined ef-
fort to give the University its big-
gest year in: intramural athletics,
that’s just what will happen.
Rooker is of the opinion that
emphasis should be spent on the
fact that too few boys enter in-
tramurals for some" reason _or
other. , In his ‘words, “Intramu-
ral sportsi-in" the past. have been
large'ly..a product of the‘ fraterni-
ties and embraced for“ the most
part only fraternity groups and a
few independents.
- “’To.circumvent this unbalanced
condition we have devised‘ a pro-

gram’ of overlapping events and

have added a few new ones. These

and more
carry out our

ization of new groups

participants to

plans.
FOOTBALL BEGINS

November 4 will see the inaug-
ural of Rooker’s program when
two touch football games will be
played on the Schenley Oval
ﬁelds.

Rocker has divided the fraterni-
ties into two brackets, the Blue

Wayne

If the Wayne University Tartars
are as hard and tough as the fam-
ous Russian Tartars, Coach Carl
‘Olson’s Panther harriers will be in
for a very tough race when they
meet the Wayne boys in Detroit
Saturday morning.

This is the ﬁrst trip that the
Panthers have made this season
although they previously met and
«defeated Purdue and Bethany on
the Schenley Park course.

Last year the Pitts defeated the
Wayne outﬁt by a perfect 15-40
score. The Panthers had the ad-
vantage of running on their own
course, but this year the conditions‘
are reversed with the Tartars
seemingly holding all —'the paper
advantages.

MORE VETERANS

For one thing they have ﬁve
veterans remaining from last
year’s harrier squad, while_Olson
has only Al Zamborski. Olson
had been , counting on Johnny
Woodruff , and Frank Bonarrotti,
both veterans from the ’36 squad,
but Woodruﬁ did _not get back
from Japan in time to get into
shape and "Bonarrotti did not‘ re-
turn to school. '

Another factor that will have a
great effect upon the outcome of.
the meet is the course on which
the boys will run. The meet is
scheduled for the ﬂat course, of
the Wayne team, a distinct disad-
vantage for the Panthers who
have been trained to run on the
hilly Schenley Park course.

As to the outcome of the meet
not even Coach Carl Olson’ will
venture a guess, merely saying V
when asked, “It’s a toss-up. You
can do the guessing, I tried.”

While the varsity hill and dal-
ers are at Detroitvthe Pitt junior '
varsity harriers will travel to In-
diana, Pa.,.to run against the In-,
diana State Teachers’ College

be the>,..i!1itiallmeet._'for the Panther

-dependent bracket will be made

with teams representing all the
schools and all independent or-
ganizations that ﬁle applications.

pendent brackets. will7meet' for the
school championship.

Time will be short and all
games will have to be played on
the scheduled date if the tourna-
ment is to be run out before
Christmas recess. And Rooker
urges the heads of the different
schools and organizations to begin
planning early so as not to hamper
him in by complicating the sched-
ule. _ .. . ,

Coach Mike Milligan has ar-
ranged a new schedule for his
freshman football squad and the

yearling football squad will make

their debut against the Penn
State Frosh on October 23 at State
College.

The previous schedule showed
the Panther Dlebes tackling the
West Virginia freshmen at Mor-
gantown in the season opener, but
this game was set ahead to No-
vember 6. The Pitt ﬁrst-year men
will also meet Kiski at Saltsburg
on October 29, and the Tartan
frosh on November 11.

DEFENSE ONLY

Though the initial game is only
a week away, theyearlings have
not yet tried their hand at offen-
sive football. ’For the last three
weeks the freshmen have ‘provided
a defensive eleven for the Varsity
to pit their offense against in prep-
aration for the West Virginia, Du-

_ quesne and Fordham engagements.

The Penn State game will give
Coach Milligan his ﬁrst slant at the
potentiality" of the freshman of-
fense. None of the starting posi-
tionsare ﬁlled and next Satur-
day’s game will decide who will
make‘ the starting posts on the
freshman eleven. The starting
lineup assignments for the State

‘contest will be picked for the de-
fensive ability shown against the

ﬁrst team in practice.

The freshmen should put a good
defensive eleven on. the ﬁeld, even
though their offense may not click
because of the lack of practice.

Introducing: ,
Pitt’ s Grid
Coaches

By HARRY LECKLER

Back again helping shape the
destiny of the 1937 Pitt grid ma-
chine is Charley Bowser, in his
old role of ﬁrst assistant to Head
Coach Jock Sutherland. Charley
played for the Panthers in 1920,
1921 and 1922- under Pop Warner
and starred at end, quarterback
and center, always as a regular.
He was acting captain in 1922.

Going to Grove City as head
coach in 1923, he remained there
through the 1926 season and it
was during these years that the
most powerful teams in the history
of the collegewere seen in action
on the gridiron. Bowser’s 1923
team tossed a real score into the
Panther’s when they held them
to a 14-7 score in a hard fought
battle and Charley’s former mates

the sturdy upstate eleven.
This was the ﬁrst meeting between
Bowser and ‘Sutherland and proved
to be the last as rival coaches.

Bowser came to Pitt in 1927 as
Jock’s ﬁrst’ assistant. This was
Sutherland’s ﬁrst great year here,
with an undefeated season and a
trip to the Coast for the Rose Bowl
game being highlights.

Bowser played an important part
in the moulding of the Panther
elevens until 1929, when he left
the University to become head
coach and director of athletics at
Bowdoin College in Brunswick,
Maine.

He almost gave up coaching
after the’ 1934 season and returned

s to Pittsburgh to go into the insur-

ance business, but Coach Suther-
land asked him to rejoin his staﬁ.
He accepted and began duties in
the capacity of backﬁeld coach.‘

When Bill Kern, Jock’s capable
ﬁrst assistant during the absence of
Bowser, left to go across the car
tracks and guide the football des-
tinies of the Tech Tartans, Bowser
was moved up to his old spot as
ﬁrst lieutenant. 

The Pitt top-sergeant is _mar-
ried, has two children, plays golf
for ‘fun but will never become a
pro, collectsstamps, and is abet-

were forced to keep a waryeye on ‘

Al Babartsky, tagged “Ali Baba”
by his buddies, is Fordham’s
strongest candidate for the All-
American team, and the eastfs
most talented tackle . . . It was
Babartsky who put an end to the
Panther’s longest goal march in
last year’s fracas . . . The burly
Babartsky is a top-notch polo
player and spends the intermis-
sions tooting a sax.

Capt. John Druze is an unspec-
tacular end, whose heroics are con-
ﬁned to blocking and tackling . . .
Druze demoralized Pitt’s short
side attack by his alert play . .
He also captains the Ram’s base-
ball team.

Edmund Franco is a massive
tackle with surprising speed . .

His work is greatly responsible
for the glory heaved on the Ford-
ham wall Jim Crowley’s
giant linesmen are a funny lot
. . . One crochets, another is a
polo player, and still another——
Franco—-is the school’s ping-pong
champ.

Alex Wojciechowicz was beaten
out for the All-American honors
by Duquesne’s Basrak last season

That’ll give you a pretty
fair idea about the tough-to-pro-
nounce athlete’s pivot ability . . .
This’ll kill ya——he weaves rugs!

Joe Woitkoski is Crowley’s star
halfback . . Joe’s place——punt-

gridders any good in the last tilt.

Of Pots And Pans
And Household
Furnishings

It’s Business

By GERTRUDE LIEBLICH

“You, too, can be the life of the party. You, too, can learn

7’

to play by ear.

As desirable as these abilities seem, they are

trivial compared to the opportunities offered to graduates of the
Research Bureau for Retail Training.
Far more substantial are the positions for which the Bureau

trains its students.
opportunities fall into four spe-
cialized ﬁelds-—merchandising, ad-
vertising, personnel work, and
control or operation.

For those persons who like to
“dress other people, or furnish
other people’s homes,” merchan-
dising presents an interesting type
of work. And merchandising con-
sists not only of buying pots and
pans, but also of such varied po-
sitions as stylists, decorators, com-
parison shoppers, fashion coordi-
nators, consultants, assistant buy-
ers, merchandise managers, and
heads of stock.

Retail merchants also need im-
aginative writers and artists for
openings in the ﬁeld of advertis-
ing. Copywriters, layout assist-
ants, advertising managers, pub-
licity directors, and assistants in
interior display or window dis-
play, form the public relations
staff which is an essential part of
retailing today.

The Retail Research Bureau at-
tempts to ﬁll the demand for
trained leaders in personnel work,
a third phase of retailing. A tal-
ent for directing employee activi-
ties and getting along with people
is necessary for an employment
interviewer, a training director, or
a personnel manager. Compara-
tively new, the industrial rela-
tions director handles problems of
labor and employer.

Mathematics and statistics play
no small part in modern depart-
ment store operation. Account-
ants, merchandise control super-
visers, and research experts work
behind the scenes to furnish com-
plete and accurate information on
store service...

These are only a few of the

In general, the¢

varied positions that a trained per-
son can work toward in retailing.
In addition, there are many junior
executive positions offering ﬁne
opportunities for development.

But the Retail Training Bureau
approaches these openings from a
sensible point of view. The Bu-
reau believes that the modern re-
tail executive must be efficient in
his own ﬁeld, but, equally import-
ant, he must be acquainted with
other management problems. The
merchandise manager should un-
derstand personnel problems, and
the training director should know
merchandising problems.

Because the Bureau believes
that in order to do one job well,
the worker must know about other
phases of retailing, the Bureau at-
tempts to give its students a well-
rounded general background as
well as specialized knowledge.

How well does the Bureau suc-
ceed in training executives for re-
tailing? Before graduation, every
member of last year's class, ex-
cept one, was placed. The list of
graduates includes the merchan-
dise manager of a London depart-
ment store, an assistant editor of
a popular magazine, copywriters,
buyers, personnel directors, the co-
author of an important new book
on retailing, the director of re-
search of a large department store,
fashion consultants, and training
directors. C

On the basis of past perform-
ance alone, the Research Bureau
for Retail Training may be called
a successful experiment.

Editor’s note: This is the sec-
ond article in _;,a. series of three,
analyzing the work of the Re-
searchlBu'reau for Retail Training.

Siedle Reports  
On Placement

Of Teachers

205 Education
Graduates Now Hold
Jobs, Bureau Shows

“The percentage of School of
Education graduates placed in

teaching positions this year will
compare favorably with the rec-
ords of other teacher preparation
intstitutions in Pennsylvania,”
states Theodore A. Siedle, director
of the Teacher’s Appointment Bu-
reau. Mr. Siedle today sent his
annual report of the bureau to the
Department of Public Education
at Harrisburg.

The report showed that 63 per
cent or 205 of the 323 persons
graduated from the School of
Education in February, June, and
August of 1937, are in teaching po-
sitions, and many more will be
placed during the course of this
year.

Of the remaining 37 per cent,
six per cent have entered busi-
ness, one per cent are taking grad-
uate work in arts or science or in
professional schools, and 30 per
cent are unaccounted for. Many
of this last 30 per cent, it is be-
lieved, have obtained business or
teaching positions unknown to the
School of Education oﬁice.

Purpose of the report to Harris-
burg is to compare the effective-
ness of placement facilities in
various institutions. According to
Dr. Henry ‘Klonower, director of
teacher education and certiﬁcation,
the information “concerning the
placement of graduates is proba-
bly more important this year than
any other year in View of the
many inaccurate statements that
have been made concerning the
?V$lll2l')l¢1 sunhlv of tear-loovc ”

(Continued from Page One)
farther into the interior, he said.

CHINESE WAIVE HELP

“Military assistance from for-
eign countries is not what the Chi-
nese people want. But they do
feel that Americans in particular,
whom they know sympathize with
the Chinese cause, have the moral
duty and the economic and po-
litical power to apply sanctions
without being drawn into the
war,” explained Dr. Chi.

He admitted that the Chinese
forces were handicapped" by the
shortage of equipment and com-
paratively poor training, but said
that these disadvantages were-
more than overcome by their ex-
cellent morale. Fighting in de-
fense of their homes gives the
Chinese troops the incentive which
will en-able them to overcome the
invaders, he. maintained.

Their extremely well trained
and equipped army is the only
real advantage that the Japanese
have over the Chinese, contended
Dr. Chi. But the weak economic
structure of the Japanese, ready to
collapse at any time, he said, is
likely to cause the downfall of the
militaristic rulers and end the
war.

ECONOMIC DEFECTS

Chief defects in the Japanese
economic situation are the facts
that business in the island empire
can be easily affected by pressure
from abroad, and that the govern-
ment is already heavily in debt,
Dr. Chi explained.

“In the war of conquest which’
Japan is now waging,” charged
Dr. Chi, “China will eventually
be reduced to the status of a Chi-
nese colony, if the Japanese aims
are realized. Japan wants to ex-

‘eleit the land and raw materials

of China for her own proﬁt.

“Japan wants to close the open
door of China to provide a hunt-
ing ground for her business men.
Exclusive economic control of
China is the ultimate Japanese‘
aim. Then China will provide a
proﬁtable ﬁeld for investment of
Japanese capital, but the trade
privileges of other nations will
disappear.

“Only after repeated attacks
upon Chinese territory did the
people ﬁnally. take action against
Japan. Picture the United States
government doing nothing even
after Canada had invaded the New
England states, New -York, and
Pennsylvania! Yet that is a par-
allel to what has happened in
China.”

A to E inclusive, 126 Cathedral;
F to K inclusive, 204 Cathedral;
L to R inclusive, 216 Cathedral;
S to U inclusive, 251 Cathedral;

Questions relating to all phases
of the University life will be
found in the examination the
freshmen will take. Jennings ex-
plained that all the material was
covered by the Pitt Compass. The
University history, names and
positions of deans and administra-
tive officers, of outstanding stu-
dent leaders and buildings, as well
University cheers and songs will
make up subject matter for the
examination.

Jennings asked that ﬁrst-year
engineers who have classes the

fifth hour be prepared to take the
examination next week when a
re-test is scheduled. All fresh-

men making grades of 70 or over
are eligible to receive the fresh-
man plaques which will be award-
ed in November.
