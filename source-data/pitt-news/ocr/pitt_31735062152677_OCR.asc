Officers of the Junior class are as
follows: President—RaymOnd L. Huff,
Ec.; Vice President-—A«.‘ P. Miller.
'Eng.; Secretary—-—-W-.W. Tanney, Econ.;
Treasurer--Minnie Z. Buckley, Col.

The contest for treasurer was a
close one, the balloting resulting in
a tie between Miss Buckley and .E ,N.
Panner, Eng. Before any action con-
cerning this tie was taken Mr. Panner
withdrew in favor of Miss Buckley,
thus giving her the oﬂ"i'ce without fur-
ther adjustment. By this generous
action Mr. Panner has gained the
favorable comments of both his sup-
porters and the advocates of Miss
Buckley’s election- ' ~

The ,meeting, was held after assemb-
ly Wednesday and was conducted by
the'BOard of. Control. Vigorous and
enthusiastic nomination speeches were
made and considerable feeling of good
natured rivalry was shown. I The race
for President was the most import-
ant one, Guy M. Williamson, Mines,
running a close second to Mr. Huff.
For Vice President, C. D. Beistel, Col.,
opposed Mr. Miller, while Mr. Tanney.

-Secretary. Helen M. Donaldson, Ed.,
was also nominated for Treasurer.
She was absent however and states
that she was not a candidate for the
office.

The Junigr Class offiicers have’im-
portant positions in the University as
well as in their class, because of the
Junior Prom. This annual affair is of
importance to the ‘whole school as
well as to the alumni and the officers
and special committees have a hard
work before them in making the oc-
casion a_ success. Mr. Huff has not
yet appointed any committees, but ex-
pects to do so in a short time.

MILITARY SCIENCE
‘ ‘ MAY BE TAUGHT.‘

 

If plans now under way meet with
the approval of the students and the
faculty, Pitt will at the beginning of
next term have a real course in Mili-
tary Science. This course will be an
outgrowth of the University cadet
corps and will offer, in addition to the
practicalodrills as heretofore given, a
series of lectures on‘ “Map Reading,”
“Map Drawing,” “Working out Prob-
lems,” “The Workings of the Board of
Strategy” and other subjects which
have not yet been decided upon. The
lectures will be handled by competent
merit and the material will-be interest-
ing as well as educational. 

The number of drill periods will be
cut down so thatia full company at-»
tendance will be possible each hour,’
as such an att‘endaIice is. necessary
to the advancement in tactical knowl-
edge beyond the movements of the
squad which have been thoroughly
mastered by the majority of those who
have been in attendance this last term.
At the beginning‘ of the Winter term,
officers and non-commissioned officers‘
will _be appointed ‘and assigned to
certain sections in order to insure. the

,A schedule of drill hours will appear
in the next issue of the WEEKLY and
if they do not conform with your
schedule the fact should be. made
known at the ﬁrst drill and if thirty
men can _be secured to agree on an-
other period in the week, a drill will
be conducted at that‘ti<me.

The lecture schedule will not be
made, up until the ﬁrst of theterm
by which time the officers in cﬁarge
will have ascertained what credit, if
any will be allowed by the University
for this work. _

JOURNALISTS HOLD . . .
TIMELY DISCUSSION.

 

“How the War News is Gathered and I
Handled”. was th esubject, for discus» ‘
Sion by several newspapermen and »
students of the Department of J ournal- A
ism at the departments round table
last Wednesday night. . . V I
“ H. E. Kroh, Pittsburgh Manager of
the International News Service spoke
of the hardships that the American
newspaper reporters are required to
undergo. “The censorship has hinder-
ed‘ much. The papers have been re-
quired -to get most of their news
through ofﬁcial statements, through
the observation by men at the front,
and through the mail that is able to
be passed through the ranks,” said Mr.
Kroh. , - . ‘L I
R. -M. Boeckel, Pittsburgh Manager

DEBATE QUESTIONS - 6
    FINALLY CHOSEN.

The Uiiiversity debaters failed to
get a satisfactory wording of the
question about compulsory sinilitary
service, and have decided upon the
following-instead: “Resolved, that the
United States should abandon the
Monroe‘ Doctrine.” This will be the
question for ‘the debate with West-
minster and probably with Pennsyl-
vania State College and with Washing-
ton and Jefferson. The ‘question for
the Wooster-Allegheny-Pitt debate

‘will be as follows: “Resolved that the

United ‘States should initiate ‘a policy
of increasing governmental responsi-
bility for the natives -of the Phillipines

to culminate in independence about

1925.” By independence is meant the
freedom which the United States al-
lowed Cuba.

 The preliminary ‘trial will be held

‘on Thursday evening, January 7th, at

7:30 P. M., in Room»203, State Hall.
All candidates must be on , ‘hand

SANGTIDNS TRIP

At the regular monthly meeting. of
the Advisory Board to Student
Activities, held last Tuesday evening,

‘ Manager A. S. Haines,.of the musical
‘ clubs was given permission to Sign- a

contract for a concert in Cuinbreland,
and in Somerset or Fairmont if p_oss-
ible. This means that a big holiday
trip will be arranged. ‘
Manager F. A. Moran of the 1916
“Ow ” appeared before the board_ to
receive his instructions and was given
permission to pursue to the publication
of theannual, provided that $1,200 in
cash, to be raised by subscription from
students be secured by February ﬁrst.
Debating came in’ for its consider-

‘ ‘ation as an activity also, and the board

appropriated $300 to ‘carry on this
work this year. This means that some
good debating trips will be arranged
as previously planned by the debate
council.

The matter of publishing the annual
ﬁnancial statement of all the different
student activities» in the university
was the subject of a lively debate. It
was the general opinion however, that
the students should know the ﬁnancial
affairs of the different clubs and
publications and a resolution to that
effect was adopted. In concurrence
with this, THE PITT WEEKLY will
publish all ﬁnancial statements as

soon as they are received in proper’

form. I

MINING SCHOOL OPENS
EXTENSION ‘CLASSES.

The school of Mines of the Univers-
ity is conducting for the third year
its extension classes in the mining
towns of western Pennsylvania. Five
classes” have been organized to study
questions of importance in prepara-
tion for the ﬁreboss examination,

Another class in the more advanced

subjects necessary to prepare candi-
dates for the mine foreman examina-
tion is being conducted at Irwin.

The enrollmentin the classes is 157,
exceeding that of the two previous
years. This number includes all
classes from miners to mine super-
intendents.. Many are following the
courses with a - view of taking the
examinations for certified positions
while others are reviewing subjects
already covered. Each class will be
met one evening a week,‘from October
tb April by a member of the school of
mines faculty. The lectures are ac-
companied by demonstrations of the
apparatus studied. ,

The cost of these courses to tlfe

student has been reduced to a mini-

mum, the only expense of the class
being the travelling expenses of the
instructor in charge. The interest
manifested in these courses, both on
the part of the student and the mine
operators, is ‘very gratifying to this
institution.
near future facilities will permit~the
school to comply with all the requests
for the organization of mining classes.

MAMMOTH JUBILEE ""5

HEL INSEA OF MUD

In spite of the inclemency of the
elements and the culmination of a
week of gain and snow, about‘ four
hundred loyal Pitt students tracked
their wet andgmuddy way to the stad-
ium last Friday evening in order to

pay their tardy honors to the team ,
which has won such great fame upon «

the} gridiron.

The celebration was officially inaugi ’

erated when Captain Smith applied
the match tothe water-soaked mass
of lumber which the freshmen had so
arduously -— and damply—-gathered
from somewhat contraband piles and
fences. After a period spent in giv-
ing yells and in dancing around the
ﬁre, during which‘ the students acquir-
ed hoarse voices and 7a coating of mud,
the meeting was adjourned to the
gymnasium, where dancing of 'a more
civilized? nature was soon in progress.
A number of speeches were given or
attempted and refreshments were
served at the close of the revelry.

The earlier partof the day was like-
wise spent in ﬁtting exercises. At the
assembly, speeches upon student mat-
ters‘ were made by F. A. Moran, busi-
ness manager of the Owl, J . S. Gow. of
the Y. M. C. A., and G. T. McCau1ey
on ‘-‘The'Team.” Selections were ren-
deredby the Glee Club, the Quartette,
and the chorus. At the close of the
exercises, a picture of the student

dy’ was secured in a pouring rain,
in both of which about two thousand
Students participated. . During the
afternoon, the girls of_the twoupper
classes held an informal dance in
Thaw» hall for the junior‘
members.

“To raise $1200.00 by the ﬁrst of

managers of the 1916 Owl Board fol-

ness Manager F. A. Moran by the Ad-
visory Board at its monthly ‘meeting
last Tuesday evening. ' «
The board stipulated that $1200.00
must be raised by Feb. _1st, before any
book may be let. This amount was

of the sums provided in other years.

Last year, Manager Lacy had to raise I :

$1000.00 and in 1913, Manager Helt
secured the sum of $1400.00.

The money is to be raised entirely by
subscription. Each junior is assessed
$5.00 for which he gets his pictureand

classes pay $2.00 for the book,.oi’1"‘e“
