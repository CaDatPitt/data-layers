Jason Davison got ayhaircut yesterday
—— but instead of walking to one of the
many barber shops in Oakland, he got
the same treatment by sitting on a fold-
ing chair in the middle of the William
Pitt Union Lawn.

From noon to 4 p.m. yesterday, Pitt’s
chapter of Buzzing for Change, a stu-
dent service organization, hosted a
fundraiser for the Children’s Hospital
of Pittsburgh Foundation in support of
children with pediatric cancer.

About 300 students registered, re-

ceived a number corresponding to their '

place in line and waited for a trim or a
buzz. Five stylists from the Supercuts
in Bethel Park, Pa., lined the lawn in
front of the Cathedral, administering
about 40 complimentary haircuts on a

green tarp. Extension cords ran from

the Union across the lawn to power the
electric clippers. .
Haircuts were free to students, but
“Buzzing for Change” T—shirts where
given to students who dropped off do-
nations. Donations made at the event
went to the Children’s Hospital Founda-

passive protest by attempting to lie down
in the Cathedral Commons to simulate
dead bodies.

The students intended to protest the
University’s lack of response to calls to
sign the Bangladesh Accord on Fire and
Building Safety, an independent and
legally binding agreement that holds
corporations accountable for workers
in their factories in Bangladesh.

The groups included Americans for

According tojoe Thomas, cofounder
of AID, the simulation symbolized lives
lost to poor factory safety.

The Accord was developed last sum-

tion, and Ellie Beam, president of Pitt’s
chapter ofBuzzing for Change, said the
group raised $480.

In addition to haircuts, students
received free pizza, soda, music and
cookies from Eat’n Park.‘

Alpha Phi Omega, a co—ed service
fraternity, distributed food at the fun-
draiser. A brother ofAlpha Phi Omega,
Davison arrived at the event to chat
with fellow members of the fraternity.

“I stopped by, realized I needed a
haircut anyway and figured I’d rather
the money went to some sort ofcause,”
Davison, a sophomore psychology ma-
jor, said. T

While he was not personally affected

April it), 2014 llhe Plli l\levvs.] w\/\/\/v.pitlnevvs.com

by childhood cancer, Davison said he
still appreciates the cause.

“I have a couple friends who are sur-
vivors, so it’s just kind of important for
me to see this cause go somewhere and
not just sit,” Davison said. “I’m happy
to donate.”

Beam, a sophomore education ma-
jor, intended for the initiative to raise
both money and awareness forpediatric
cancer. ' _

“When [child patients] go through
chemo, they lose their hair, so the free
haircuts are in support ofthem,” Beam
said.

Beam explained that students could
come to have dead ends trimmed or
request a full—on‘buzz cut. If a student
scissored off enough hair, he or she
had the option of donating his or her
tresses to Locks of Love, a nonprofit

.

organization that creates hairpieces for
cancer patients from salon donations.
Sarah Modispacher, a Supercuts styl-
ist who donated her time to cut hair
at the event, said two students cut off
enough hair to donate to Locks of Love.
She said she appreciated the gesture.
“[The donations] were really sweet

‘and almost unexpected that someone

would want to do that —— supporting a
good cause and helping out kids with
cancer —— which is amazing,” Modis-
pacher said.

The majority of her requests that
day were for trims, Modispacher said,
although she estimated that the group
gave about 10 buzz cuts during‘ the
event. ,

Mary Burke, a sophomore communi-
cations and rhetoric major, registered
at the event after a class.

She said she heard about the event

' through her membership in Gamma Sig-

ma Sigma, a service sorority; She said
she was in need of a spring trim and was
happy to participate in the fundraiser
after learning about the initiative.

“I just think [the Children’s Hospital
Foundation] is a really great cause,”
Burke said. “I know people who have
used that hospital before, and I really
support it.” I

DIE-IN

Bangladeshi garment factory, causing
the deathof 1,129 factory workers.

“This is how students have to com-
municate with administrators,” Thomas,
a senior biology and political science
major, said.» ‘

But before the students could lie
down, campus police, Vice Chancellor
for External Relations G. Reynolds Clark
and Kenyon Bonner, director of student
life and associate dean of students, de-
layed the protest by 15 minutes.

Instead of allowing the students to
lie down in protest, Univefsity officials
let them stage a sit-down protest. For
about 20 minutes, demonstrators sat
on the ﬂoor of the Cathedral of Learning
common room in two lines.

According to University spokesper-
sonjohn Fedele, the demonstrators were
not allowed to lie down because the com-
mons is a reservable space, and it would
be considered a tripping hazard.

The students would have had to re-
serve the Cathedral Commons fo_r their
event in order to lie down, Fedele said.

Julie Radomski, AID’s vice president,

said the goal of the “die-in” was to get

the University to sign the accord.

“We want to prove this is something
that Pitt students really care about,”
Radomski, a senior anthropology and
economics major, said-

AID organized the protest after feel-
ing unheard in their efforts to lobby the
University into signing the accord, Ra-
domski and Thomas said. The organi-
zation has submitted letters and a pe-
tition with hundreds of signatures to
Chancellor Mark Nordenberg urging the
University to sign the accord.

To further progress on signing the
accord, Radomski and other members
of AID have been meeting with Lori Bu-
rens, coordinator of licensing in Pitt’s
Athletics Department. However, the de-
cision to officially align with the accord
lies in the hands of University officials,
Radomski said.

Following Burens’ suggestion to ap-
proach the chancellor about aligning
with the accord, Radomski met with
Nordenberg “informally and briefly”
at a reception and dinner for the Bellet

Teaching Award about two weeks ago.
Radomski said she felt that Nordenberg
did not think the issue was relevant to
Pitt.

Fedele said Pitt officials are currently
considering the matter of signing the ac-
cord and are in the process of reviewing
the accord with the Collegiate Licensing
Company, which coordinates licensing
agreements between suppliers and Pitt.

“Students will be notified when a
decision has been made,” Fedele said
in an email.

At 12:45 p.m., after discussing the
matter with campus police, Clark and
Bonner, about 25 students were ﬁnally
allowed to sit in the Cathedral Commons
for their protest. ’

The 15-minute discussion between
AID, the police and administrators re-
ceived more attention than the actual
protest. A small crowd of about 10 pro-
testers gathered in front of the main
entrance to the Cathedral to talk to the
administrators, obscuring the doorway.

During the 20-minute protest, Nick

Goodfellow, a junior and AID board
member studying communications and

rhetoric, passed out fliers asking pass-

ersby to sign the group’s petition.
Goodfellow said he finds it concern-
ing that Pitt has waited this long to start
talking about this issue.
“I think we got a response from the
administration,” Goodfellow said after

the protest. “My Pitt apparel shouldlft

come at the expense of workers’ lives.”

Natalie Russell
Columnist

It seems absurd that there is still
debate over the barbaric abuse of
parental authority that is corporal
punishment.

According to researchers at the
University of Chicago, 77 percent
of men and 65 percent of women
believe it is sometimes necessary
to discipline a child with “a good,
hard spanking.” That this crass, re-
pugnant and medieval word choice
was still approved by an average of
nearly three—quarters of parents
in the United States is disturbing,
but I shudder to think of what the
results might have been had’ the
proposition been worded with

employed to make violence more
palatable.

Setting aside the inherent

_ wrongness of corporal punish-
ment, decades of research prove
that such punishment (not in-
cluding child abuse) is not only
ineffective, but harmful to a child’s
cognitive development and psycho-
logical health. A long-term study
by researchers from the Columbia
University School of Social Work
focused on 2,000 families in 20
cities across the United States. Par-
ents were interviewed right after
their children were born and then
at ages 1, 3, 5 and 9. Children who
were spanked at ages 3 and 5 had
higher levels of rule—breaking and
displayed aggressive behavior at
age 9.

The results also showed that
children who were spanked by their
fathers at age 5 were more likely to
score lower onlanguage—compre—
hension and vocabulary tests. The
study carefully controlled for other
potential inﬂuencers, including

one of the euphemisms frequently .

prior levels of troubled behavior,
earlier development and other risk
factors.

A 2013 study authored by Emily
Douglas, associate professor of so-
cial work at Bridgewater State Uni-
versity, and Rose Anne Medeiros, a
quantitative methodolo gist at Rice
University, found that spanking is
no more effective at correcting
short-terrn misbehavior than al-
ternative forms of discipline such
as time-outs, withholding privi-
leges or simply explaining why the
child’s behavior is wrong. The study
offered ﬁirther evidence to support
that childhood spanking leads to
increased aggression and slower
mental development and contin-
ued on to report signiﬁcant links
between childhood spanking and
criminal offenses, antisocial behav-
ior, domestic violence, lower aca-
demic achievement and unhealthy
parent-child relationships. ‘

But let’s take a moment to talk
about the “I turned out ﬁne” crowd
—— _the human cockroaches who
out themselves as the stragglers
of social progress in every moral-
ity debate. If you’ve ever dreamt
of time travel, these folks create
an eerily accurate replica of the
Dark Ages. They’re the ones who
are (suspiciously) adamant about
the cause of needlessly terrorizing
children. They’ll accept vague an-
ecdotes over decades of scientiﬁc
research. Though the requirements
necessary for ‘-‘turning out ﬁne”
are subjective and predictably

’ self-serving, I’m skeptical about

the “ﬁneness” of a person who is
entirely undisturbed by physically
harminga child. Perhaps a second
opinion is necessary.

Murray Straus, founder and
co-director of the Family Research
Lab and professor emeritus of so-

Physical punishment of children is a

human—rights violation

ciology at the University of New
Hampshire, collected more than
four decades of research on the

subject ip his book “The Primor-

dial Violence,” noting the various
side effects seen in children who
.have been disciplined by force. He
points out, “More than 100 stud-
ies have detailed these side effects
of spanking with .more than 90
percent agreement among them.
There is probably no other aspect
of parenting and child behavior
‘where the results are so consis-
ten .”
As a result of this overwhelming
evidence, physical punishment is
outlawed in more than 20 nations
around the world. The United Na-
tions called for worldwide prohibi-
tion of spanking, yet the practice
is still legal in all 50 U.S. states.
An appalling 19 states still allow
.corporal punishment in schools,
which leads to the subjection
of thousands of students to this
archaic disciplinary tactic every
year. It’s no surprise that the states
with the highest amount of human
rights violations are the same ones
that claim moral superiority. (Prov-
erbs 13:24: “Whoever spares the
rod hates his son, but he who loves
him is diligent to discipline him.”)
Corporal punishment of chil-
dren is a public-health issue. It’s
not a matter of parenting prefer-
ence, but of the right of children to
live free of physical attacks that are
justiﬁed under the guise of “disci-
pline.’-’ It took until the turn of the
20th century for U.S. law to validate
a woman’s right to not be physically
punished by her husband. Is it re-
ally goingto take another century
to recognize the gross injustice of
violence against children,too? I

To the Editor,

While walking through Towers Lobby yes-
terday, I was caught off guard by a small,
though alarming, ﬂyer that was littering the
ground. Delivering information regarding
the Health Fair at the School of Pharmacy,
this ﬂyer had a great list of topics ranging
from cancer to dementia to diabetes. The
list ended, however, with a topic that was

LETTER To THE EDITOR

Simply put, this isn’t a viable discussion
topic for ahealth fair. The health fair makes
the mistake of mixing both preexisting clini-
cal conditions with unhealthy decisions —
seen in the listing of “cancer” with “physi-
cal activity.” This exposes the prevalence of
misinformation about the LGBT community
proliferated by advertisements that create
a dangerous parallel between sexuality and
illness. The implicit association of LGBT with
tobacco use and physical inactivity implies

that being a member of the LGBT community
is an unhealthy choice.

Further, this health fair neglects het-
erosexual activity in its campaign, which
thereby associates homosexual activity with
diseases —- further stigmatizing the LGBT
community by associating it with illness. I
am fairly certain there isn’t any disease that
only afflicts gays, so why would only LGBT
be listed in the health-fair advertisement?
Obviously, this advertising campaign is, it-

self, afflicted by misinformation.

As a member of the gay community on
campus, it is incredibly frustrating to see
such a vividly negative association of the
LGBT community with illness. I assumed that
such a diverse college community would be
intuitively more intelligent about incorrect
associations, yet I am left disappointed. I

A dilapidated and vast office building that’s
falling apart might not seem like an ideal
place to stage an uprising, but Quantum
Theatre’s latest production, “Pantagleize,”
nonetheless utilizes such a space.

“Pantagleize” —- which runs from April
11 to 27 — is a humorous play about revolu-
tion based on Michel de Ghelderode’s 1931
“farce to make you sad” ‘and serves as an al-
lusion to Allen Ginsber'g’s “King of May” trip
to Prague in 1965. It centers on the character
Pantagleize, a philosophical and somewhat
cynical man who accidentally utters a secret
phrase andisparks a revolution in an un-
named Eastern European country.

. Playwrightjay Ball wrote the latest stage
adaptation, which creates a new twist on
the original 1931 script that was popular be-
tween playwrights but otherwise relatively
unknown. A lot of the humor was outdated,
and most of the characters spoke Czech. The
new version is more accessible to Ameri-
cans and utilizes modern references to make
it more appealing. It asks questions that
pertain to democracy and contemporary
revolutionary movements.

As a “farce,” the play sets a similar tone
to the work of Monty Python.
“I love that about the original play: the

‘Pantagleize’ makes use of old nice bulding; Courtes of uantum Theatre

mixture of laughing and crying,” Ball said.
“It’s almost how I respond to_]on Stewart on
‘The Daily Show.”’

Ball andjed Allen Harris, the director of
“Pantagleize,” spent time in Eastern Europe
over the course of their careers. “Panta-
gleize” marks their fourth collaboration
together and their second with Quantum
after 2010’s “The Task.” l

“Jed and I were very interested in using
the play to think about the current world
of revolutionary topics,” Ball said. “For
example, the Occupy movement ,or what’s
going on in Ukraine.” A —

Quantum is also known for creating a
wildly different atmosphere every time it
produces something new. “Pantagleize” will

"be staged at the Lexington Technology Cen-

ter, a run- down ofﬁce building that Quantum
Artistic Director Karla Boos found in the
area of Pittsburgh called “construction junc-
tion.” For this new setup, Harris worked with
his design team to maintain the Technology
Center’s intimacy while adapting the space.
“One of the things I liked about the space
was that there are ofﬁces and walls. You can
go behind awindow,” Harris said. “We’re dis-
covering how to use it asmuch as possible.”
Along with the design of the set, costume
designer Susan Tsu collaborated closely with

Perhaps this is why “riZe vadzimu riZe,’V’

pace, and the record’s lyrical themes — many
of which rail against the sad materialism of
modern black culture — would have felt just
as comfortable in an indie rap album from

the ’9os as they do here.

In fact, it’s these lyrics that make the al-
bum’s avant—garde aspirations seem so des-
perate. Whether Maraire is lambasting, “Make
a million dollars selling Gucci or hot beats?’ as
he does on“The B.A.D Is So Good” or givingus
similarly generic complaints about the state
of modern hip-hop materialism, the words
don’t do much heavy lifting.

When your complaints about your genre
— a topic you’ve presumably thought about
—- echo the words of a 17-year-old New Zea-
land girl, it’s pretty safe to say you’re not saying
anything particularly new. That’s a shame,
because from a production standpoint, this
record is marvelous — a precarious balanzge of
modern electronic beats with complex instru-
mentation that’s as shocking of a spectacle as

jugglingﬂaming chainsaws. Had Maraire put
as much thought into complicating our dis-
cussion ofhip-hop’s materialism, he might’ve

— made something really innovative — even

avant-garde. I

Tidus, a 17-year-old professional athlete,
gets scooped up by a Godzilla-like monster
called Sin and transported 1,000 years
into the future to a world called Spira,
which is constantly on the verge of de-
struction by Sin. Like Sin, who dies and
is reborn, “Final Fantasy X” in many ways
hasn’t changed from its ﬁrst incarnation
— for better and for worse.

Harris to create costumes that ﬁt each of
the -10 characters. She created the looks by
examining Eastern European countries and
military revolutions over the last 50 years,
reading up on the original text and created
a distinct style.

“People disguise themselves and change
roles,” Tsu said. “It’s not a play of subtlety
in anyway.”

" Because Quantum doesn’t have its own
theateror costume personnel, there are
practical limitations to some of the designing
that demand a lot of creativity and artistic
ability from the designers.

“Every play is different because of the
design teams,” Tsu said. “One of the things

I enjoy enormously is the crew that Karla

assembles.” V _ — .

According to Harris, however, all these
moving parts only serve to make Quantum’s
performances all the more surprising.

“I think it’s an exciting adventure for the
audience,” Harris said. 87

Strong took up entrepreneurship soon
after graduating from Taylor Allderdice

start his ﬁrst business, Shadow Lounge,
but couldn’t ﬁnd a space.

“Where Starbucks is now, I inquired

to outperform Shadow Lounge. The ﬁrst
Ava Lounge was on South Highland Avenue
in East Liberty. ’

“It became this really cool bar and
lounge, very deep, Dj—heavy, but we had .a
really successful Monday jazz night that
ran for like six years,” Strong said of the
Ava Lounge in East Liberty.

When°Quiet Storm ownerjill MacDowell
called Strong to tell him about an opening
in the building that had formerly been the
Luna Bar at 304 North Craig St., Strong
jumped at the opportunity, deciding to
move his most successful business venture
down the road.

“The place feels very welcoming, deﬁ-
nitely meant for a more mature crowd,”
said E.]. Grifﬁn, a customer who came to
Ava Lounge for the Steel City Poetry Slam.

General Manager Anand Young credits
the new place with “being able to bring
about a creative menu that we can con-
stantly evolve.” The food, he said, is the
emphasis now.

“We have yet to tap into our full poten-
tial because we have'n’t gotten to do the
events we want to do,” Young said.

FANTASY

When “X” ﬁrst hit stores in 2001 for Play-
Station 2, it set the record for fastest-
selling console role—playing game and
went on to be the seventh best-selling
PS2 game of all time. The “Final Fantasy”
series has been around since 1987, but
“X,” the 10th installment, was the ﬁrst

. to produce a true sequel, “X-2,” in 2003.

As the console generation winds down,

www.pitt.edu/~ppc

developers have been re-releasing classic
games with some high-deﬁnition gloss,
and conveniently, Square Enix packaged
“X” and “X-2” on one Blu—ray disc for
PlayStation 3 and separately for the Play-
Station Vita.

Modiﬁed character models astound
with novelty and an extended range of
expression. Facial animation and design
was completely reworked, and the high-
resolution models compete with more
contemporary games. The low-resolution
models are on the level of the high—res

ones from the original game, so it’s nice
to look at something resembling a hu-
man, not one whose face is awkwardly
squashed in. Despite the tweaked faces‘,
‘gen-eral animation weighs down the oth-
erwise attractive new characters — each
still has only a few programmed actions
(Rikku’s puppy-dog air-pawing comes to
mind), which are stiff ‘and typically don’t
match the conversation being conveyed.

Undoubtedly, the best part of the re-
master is its remixed music. Stale and

(looking at you, “Battle Theme”), and
replaced with brand—new vibrancy, key
changes, tempos and overall robustness.
The soundtrack remix denies subtlety.
Heading into: new areas becomes excit-
ing mostly to hear how the music’s been
redeﬁned, and it never ceases to innovate
over the original. Even the series’ victory
fanfare that plays at the end of random
battles has been altered to sound more
orchestral, rather than new-age.

The remaster includes the interna-
tional versiohs of both games, meaning
that a few new superbosses, the‘ Dark
Aeons, await battle. A short movie called
“The Eternal Calm”_ bridges the content
between games, and “Last Mission” is
playable, for the ﬁrst time, a sequel to
“X-2” revealing what happened to the
protagonists after its conclusion.

‘ The most groundbreaking addition
in the international version is the Expert

' Sphere Grid,» an improved form of the
leveling system. The expert grid doesn’t V

make the game any harder, but it affects
how you play because of its radical dif-
ference from the traditional Sphere Grid,
which is strict and easy to follow. Rather,
the expert grid puts all seven characters
in the middle and gives players leave to
develop characters into whatever role
they choose. The summoner and major
character Yuna and her guardian, the

black magician Lulu, stand out particu— '

larly, as they can swap black— and white-

magic paths from the very outset, mean-

ing that players can give them a variety

of new and different abilities earlier in
. the game. While this allows for extremely
interesting and crazy customization, the
expert grid is recommended only to ex-
pert players ~’-— at the expense of novel
opportunities, it winds up weakening
the characters’ strength, defense and
magic stats, making them less effective
individually. "'

The HD remaster is a great invest-
ment for old fans and those looking to
get into the series for the ﬁrst time. The
new stuff entertains pretty well, but some
old bits haven’t reformed, which can be a
detriment. Regardless, the HD remaster
is worth picking up, because it might be
the ﬁnal and most deﬁnitiveooverhaul of
these popular storylines as the “Final
Fantasy” s'er_ies delves into newer plots
on future consoles. I

WRESTLING

tivities Fair in August to try to recruiting
new wrestlers. After the team was formed,
they set up mixers with other club sports
teams and came up with other off-the-mat

options to help the team develop cama-

raderie.
However, the club faced an obstacle that
threatened to undermine all the progress.

Unfortunately for the club, it had ex-”
hausted all of its funds, and with the tour- -

nament taking place in Texas, attending
would be expensive for any interested
wrestlers.

“It was frustrating,” sophomoreclub
member Matt Bruskin said. “We prepared
all year for a chance to attend nationals,
only to be unable to attend after qualify-

. ing.”

The club used the majority of its $5,000
allotment from Student Government Board

to attend the minimum number of tourna- '

ments to qualify for the conference tour-
nament and, thus, a shot at the national
tournament.

April 10, 2014 I The Pitt News l wvvvv.pittnevvs.com

“A pretty consistent thing for the top 10
teams this year was that they had almost
double the number of matches we 'did,”
Tanenbaum said. “We were able to do a lot
with a little, and I think with more funding,
we could crack that top—10 status.”

Schretzenmaier, who was able to afford
the trip to Texas after receiving help from
his family, explained the severe ﬁnancial

i _ disadvantage that his club faces in talking
O to. competitors in Texas. . ‘ I v : V

“A_lot of clubs are the only wrestling

programs at their schools,>so they get more _

ﬁmding,”lhe said. “Plus, they have longer
histories, so they have more alumni to look
to for donations.”

With the less-than-idealmonetary situ-
ation ﬁgured o_ut, Schretzenmaier could fo-
cus on wrestling. He ﬁnished in sixth place
to earn himself All-American status. The
top eight wrestlers become All—Americans.

He hopes that his accomplishment will
motivate his teammates and also help them
attend next year’s tournament.

Despite the concentrated effort to ﬁeld
a full lineup at the beginning of the school
year, it was impossible for Schretzenmaier
to truly understand how the club would

’ “I really had no idea that six other guys
would qualify,” Schretzenmaier said. “I
didn’t get the team in the mindset that, not
only were we training to do well at confer-
ences, but we were training for nationals.”

At the beginning of the season, the

club was doing little to show anyone that A

“At the start of the year, we focused a
.lot on technique and teaching new moves,”
Tanenbaum said. “After not doing so
well after our ﬁrst few tournaments, we
changed the focus of practice to intense
conditioning.”

It paid off, as along with Schretzen-
maier and Tanenbaum, Bryan Muchoney,

year that I’ve accomplished everything I
wanted from the sport a l-ongtime ago,
so everythingl do is for the team, not for
me,” Schretzenmaier said. “It makes me
happy to get the team some recognition on
the national level, and hopefully it’ll make
the path easier for my fellow teammates
in the future.” ‘

While Schretzenmaier’s on—the—mat
performance gave the club instant recog-
nition, it’s what he did off the mat that will
leave the most lasting impact on the club.

“Scott is the glue holdingthis group
together. He came in this year determined
to make a team of less than 10 people into
a full lineup that would compete at tourna-
ments,” Tanenbaum said.

Perhaps that’s why he feels more of a
sense of achievement from what his team
has achieved, as opposed to his personal
success. A ' _

“I really hope that my accomplishments
challenge my guys to not only want to go
to nationals in the future, but to do even
better than me,” Schretzenmaier said. “I’m
very excited to see what my fellow team-
mates and officers can accomplish in the
[future].” I I u ‘

Tori N irschl moved to third, but Pitt failed
to bring home the tying run, and the score
stayed the same. b

Virginia‘ Tech 2, Pittsburgh 0

In the nightcap, the offensive woes
continued. Pitt outhit Virginia Tech 4-2
but didn’t manage to plate any runs in the
contest. Savannah King (7-13), the junior
who served in a relief role in game one,
started the second and suffered the loss,
despite giving up a mere two hits and two
walks while striking out three in four in-
nings of work.

The only real action that took place in
the game came in the bottom of the ﬁfth.
The Hokies led off their half of the inning
with back—to-back singles. With runners
on ﬁrst and third, a passed ball by Pitt
pitcher Larkin, who was pitching in relief
this time, gave Virginia Tech their ﬁrst run.
The Hokies followed that with a ﬂyout that
brought home the second and ﬁnal run.

The Panthers never posed a threat in A"

the game, as all four of Pitt’s hits were
singles and they struck out seven times.

Junior center ﬁelder Carly Thea went
2-for-6 in the doubleheader and kept her
batting average at 0.397, which currently
ranks third best in the ACC.

Pitt returns to action this weekend
when they take on new conference mem-
ber and old Big East foe Syracuse (15-18,
6-7 ACC) in a home series.

First pitch is 1 p.m. on Saturday at
