Chancellor
States Pitt
Draft Policy

In a memo, dated April 25,
1968, to all deans and department
chairmen from the Chancellor,
the University clarified its policy
concerning students who with-
draw for reason related to the
draft or mobilization of military
units.

“As a general policy, if a stu-
dent in good standing withdraws
from the University for reaso-ns
related to the draft or mobiliza-
tion of military units such action
should neither prejudice his eli-
gibility for future readmission
nor work an undue financial
hardship on him. The University
cannot, and should not attempt
to judge questions of individual
conscience, and therefore no dis-
tinction should be made between
those who are inducted into mili-
without deceit and on the basis
of moral conviction, elect other
courses of action in response to
the draft.”

Also, “schools and departments
are urged to support and requests
of graduate students for occupa-
tional deferments based upon es-
sential community need, and to
furnish letters to local draft
boards on their behalf. In the
case of graduate teaching assist-
ants, departments may forward
through the deans for signature
of the Chancellor, letters to indi-
vidual students’ local draft boards
outlining the essential need for
his services in the teaching of
undergraduates at the Univers-
ity.”

University’s Faculty Senate to Consider

8 Proposals To Irove Race Relations .

by DAVE BAER

At a special meeting of the
University Senate the repre-
sentatives of the school’s fac-
ulty will consider several pe-
titions which are currently be-
ing circulated among the fac-
ulty. Dr. Henry Finck, an as-
sociate professor at the Uni-
versity School of Medicine.is
heading the group which is cir-
culating the petitions in an effort
to force the administration to
both recognize- the existence of a
crisis in race relations in the city
and.do something about the crisis.

Dr. Finck and his colleaues are
presenting the following petitions
to the senate:

—The University should estab-
lish an enpowed chair or~profes-
sorship named for Dr. Martin Lu-
ther King. Jr. to emphasize Negro

This article is the first part of a series concerning U .5’. Government credibility of events of the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution.

Author William Lederer has called United States a nation of sheep——a nation
whose populace will believe almost anything that Federal Government says. This criti-
cal classification has, unfortunately, a great deal of validity. The people of the U.S.
have been misled and pushed around by many fallacious Government statements and

Perhaps the most crucial of all the Administrative con jobs was the passage of

Questions Surround Presidential
Committee’s Draft Promulgation

by ALAN BARR

The National Advisory Com-
mission on Selective Service rec-
ommended last year that local
boards be replaced with 300 to
500 area boards under eight re-
gional offices and a national head-
quarters. This commission was
headed by Burke Marshall, form-
er civil rights chief at the Justice
Department. The commission cri-
ticized the draft system for lack
of uniformity in classification
and deferment of draft regis-
trants. It was further indicated
that this situation resulted from
the local draft board system —-
hence the new idea of area boards
using data processing machines
to insure uniform national stand-
ards

 

  

s a 0 w p last March, the
President appointed a committee
to give further study to the rec-
ommendations for radical trans-
formation of the draft system-
This Committee consisted of Gen-
eral Hershey, Robert S. McNa-
mara, and Charles L. Schultze.
former director of the Bureau Of
the Budget. Certainly, General
I-Iershey..cannot be considered an
objective. onlooker.

   

 

 

The committee fell into dis-
agreement with the ideas of radi-
cally changing the draft board
system as advocated by the Na-
tional Advisory Commission. The
committee has recently stated
that they felt the nation's 4,084
draft boards should be retained.
This is not surprising, since Gen-
eral Hershey is a member of this
committee and even last sum-
mer he inserted language in the
new draft law to preserve the
integrity of the local boards.

General Hershey argued last
Tuesday that the Commission had
used the word uniformity “care-
lessly.” What has been happen-
.ing, for example, is that teachers
in one area are being deferred

while not so in another; This is
happening “because there are
enough of them in one place and
a shortage of them in the other,”
said General Hershey. It seems
unfair that one can be discrimin-
ated against on the basis of where
he works.
At any rate, a lack of money
has prevented the consideration
of any recommendations. The
Committee itself has suggested
hiring auditors to review local
board classifications every three
months and the training of alter-
nate clerks to be used during the
absence of the regular local board
clerks. This move would hardly
improve the present situation since
there still could be no effective
national deferment standard.

In U.S. policy concerning the
Vietnam War, the community
imposes its will on the major-
ity. Curtis Crawford, lecturer in
ethics and politics at the New
School for Social Research in New
York City, has proposed a con-
conscious objection system
whereby recognition could be giv-
en to the right of the individual
to refuse to serve in Vietnam
without subverting the authority
of the community. _

tion—the fateful .resolu:ti-on -thialt

Vrietnaxm.

The Tonkin Gulf Resolution
gives the President sole author-
ity to escalate or de-escalate the
war. This, however, is but one
side of the issue.

The crux of the controversy
concerns the validity of the Reso-
lution. Many authoritative offi-
cials have come to believe that
the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution is
a document without valid basis,
and that the Administration, spe-
cifically Defense Secretary Rob-
ert McNamara, misled both the
Congress and the public into be-
lieving that there was great need
for quick passage of the Resolu-
tion.

The Resolution —- a document
providing for the initial "escala-
tion of the Vietnamese War--was
acted upon in response to two (.2)
naval incidents in the Gulf of

would be established to hear ar-

tice of the American military in-
volvement in Vietnam. The tri-
bunals would determine whether
particular individuals would have

fication as conscientious object-

— The University should imple-

—The University should offer
smaller classes and tutorial rela-

— The University should provide ‘

The petitions also note the poor

plicants receive in t h e g r a d e
schools and high schools.

Evidence

 

Tonkin that provided a c alyst“
for a U.S. bombing of the North.
This writer and other critics of
the resolution contend that the
U.S. was completely unjustified
in its retaliation of North Viet-
nam; and that the Tonkin Gulzf
Resolution represents a mock-
ery of -the liegislaxtive process.

The -Governrmeonst, on the other
hand, claims that it was com-
pletely justified tin its retalia-
tion and subsequent escalation

They claim that in light of the
two unprovoked North Vietna-
mese attacks on our ships, the
U.S. had no recourse except to
bomb the North Vietnamese
Coast. This point, to say the least,
is debatable.

The purpose‘ of this upcoming
analysis is to provide the reader
with a clearer understanding of
the tactics used in “credibility
gap” controversies and to reveal
the total illegality and haphazard
manner many of the U.S. esca-
lation of the Vietnamese War.
Finally, it will, hopefully, make
many more people aware that the
terse classification-nation of
sheep-—is not merely a joke 01
funny choice of words but a pen-
etrating description of our sur.
prising credulousness.

Wise Proposals

The University Faculty is now circulating a petition in
an effort to improve race relations in the city. The petition
includes a number of significant proposals that will be acted
upon by the Faculty Senate this month.

The proposals call for the establishment of an endowed
chair for Martin Luther King, Jr.; a Martin Luther King. Jr.
Memorial Library of Negro History; a Martin Luther King.
Jr. Memorial Scholarship covering tuition, books, fees. and
room and board for black students from poverty areas: an im-
plementation of Chancellor Posvar’s recommendation that
entrance requirements in the College be lowered for appli-
cants from poverty areas; a remedial course to help black stu-
dents who have had poor preparation for college work. and
full scholarships for some or all disadvantaged students.

We must applaud this timely faculty sentiment for many

. Black students as evidenced in the Pitt News Negro Supple-

ment are not only small in number at the University but are
also are products of poor college preparation in high school.

But the faculty members have not only considered the
problem at the University level. They have asked the admin-
istration to develop special problems to combat white racism
in the community. This, we feel is one of the more impor-
tant aspects of the faculty proposal. We believe that the ur-
ban university should take an active part in the arduous strug-
gle of combatting white racism for this is surely the root of
all racial and social tensions.

We strongly urge the Faculty Senate and the adminis-
tration to implement these wise proposals. With this sort of
implementation, the problems of urban unrest will become
passe and this nation will eventually forge ahead and adhere
itself to the principles of social justice.

Serious Oversight

A Presidential committee on the administration of the
draft stated Monday that the Selective Service Commission
should maintain its present structure. This means. essential-
ly, that the local board system will be maintained in the fu-
ture. The Committee’s recommendation. however. made ab-
solutely no reference to the controversy surrounding the is-
sue of graduate deferments. This, we believe is a serious
oversight.

By not studying a feasible alternative to the present state
of the graduate deferrment and by simply maintaining the lo-
cal board system, the Presidential committee has merely kept
the draft at its present archaic level of inefficiency and in-
eptitude.

The most serious implication of the new recommenda-
tion is the absence of a solution of the graduate school man-
power problem. The Committee has merely substituted mili-
tary manpower for graduate manpower.

Essentially, the problem boils down to a question of
priorities. In this nation—a nation that. has reaped the values
of education to become the most powerful nation in the
world——should the military establishment rasp away its new
recruits from the graduate schools of this country.

Dr. Gustave R. Arlt, president of the Council of Grad-
uate Schools, believes that in this time of distorted military
priorities, the graduate schools and consequently the nation-
al interest will be damaged. Dr. Arlt predicts that graduate
enrollment will probably dip 40 to 60 per cent. If this. is the
case, the nation will suffer a ten year Ph.D. output setback.

The power of this nation lies in its graduate schools for
it is in these halls of learning that men learn how to better
themselves and their society. Oddly enough, the Presidential
'ttee h sne 1 t (1 tbs vital point.

place to live near the campus. are
placed at the mercy of ruthless
landlords who bleed them for ev- .
ery possible penny while placing strict restrictions
on them.

SELDOM, IF EVER, does the landlord stop to
consider the problems of the student. My experi-
ence during the past trimester had turned me
against landlords to such an extent that I was will-
ing to do anything rather than go through the pain-
ful ordeal of arguing. bickering. worrying and pay-
ing dearly for a small. roach-infested. dirty apart-
ment.

~ However. the understanding. friendliness. and
care of two people has restored my faith in land-
lords. I found that they can be reasonable; they can
be fair; they can be understanding.

 

   

WHILE LOOKING for a place to stay in Fort
Lauderdale during the break. I presented the case
of five struggling students to a smiling landlady.

' Much to my surprise. she nodded sympathetically

and offered us a spacious. clean cottage apartment
for more than reasonable rates.

During our stay in Lauderdale. our landlord.
Mr. Fisher and his wife. proved just how under-
standing landlords can be. Crises such as traffic
tickets. shortage of money. and the inconveniences
of sunburn. our own cooking. and complaining
neighbors were met with the Fishers helping in
every way possible.

The Fishers not only insured that we had every-
thing we needed in our apartment. but opened their
own house to us for telephone calls and advice.

THE FISHERS said that their kindness and un-
derstanding have rarely been abused. The students
to whom .they rent are considerate and careful
while in their aprtments. The Fishers noted that
their guest return the understanding they receive.
and enjoy their stay without damaging the apart-
ments.

It seems that if two people. who live in a city
that has seen college students at their worst. can re-
main friendly and understanding. landords in other
college areas can at least be fair to students.

COLUMBIA CRISIS

Education’s Threat OfA Dagger

by MIKE BROURMAN

Violence seems to be gaining
an alarming foothold on the col-
lege campus. The recent demon-
stration at Col-
u m b i a w a s
merely the lat-
est ‘in a series

t h r e a t e n the
stability of the

education s y s -
tem in Ameri-
ca.

T h e_ differ-
ence between

dissent and vio-
lence has become obscured as

V some college students have at-

tempted to legitimize their vio-
lent acts by covering them with
a cloak of ‘morality and academic
freedom.

THE COLUMBIA CASE is a
prime example of this. A small
minority of students believed that
it was within their right as "the

 

enlightened" few to tie up the en-
tire campus for more than a week.
thus treading on the rights of
some 20.000 fellow students who
wished to attend classes.

This philosophy reaks of nihil-
ism and the superman notions of

Nietzche. A psychologist has ob-

served that these student radicals
have no real concern with free-
dom. They are not interested in
the freedom of others and have
no conception of the fact that a
democracy guarantees others the
right to do something which they
disagree with.

What is particularly troubling
about this new wave ishow close-
ly it parallels the actions of the
fascist mobs in Germany during
the Hitler takeover.

THEY TOO BELIEVED That.
as superior beings they had the

right to force their views on others.

The new radicals try to dismiss
their closeness to the fascist tac-
tics with contentions of a high-

er morality. But. this argument is
clearly an unsubstantial one.

AS US Solicitor General Erwin
Griswold. a former dean of the
Harvard Law School. has pointed
out. “I cannot distinguish in prih-
ciple the legal quality of the de-
termination to halt a troop train
to protest the Vietnam war . . .
from the determination to fire
shots into a civil rights leader's
home to protest integration.“

VIOLENT opposition to th 5
law. argues Griswold. constitutes
the forcible disregard of the free-
dom of thers. and is nothing short
of rebellion.

It is ironic that such acts should
occur on college campuses. which
are intended to teach rational re-
sponse to society's problems. Stu-
dents must learn that the only
way a free. organized society can
exist is through the rule of the
law. not the mob.

districts. knocking on doors. and
passing out McCarthy literature."
This enthusiasm was to haunt
them a few short days later.

Even as late as the April 3 edi-
tion of the Pitt News, Mr. Rus-
kay. the director and voice of the
Students for McCarthy was re-
ported to have been pleased by
the fact that Pittsburghers actual-
ly knew about McCarthy and
were interested in learning more.
This was within a few’ hours of
his appearance on television
where he inferred that since John-
son’s big bow-out. there was no
reason to keep up with campaign-
ing for McCarthy. The big love
affair was over.

Even I realize that to get John-
son at all costs was the first aim
of the students‘ group. All at once.
with one announcement from the
President, Bobby Baby has be-
come a man, a leader, a safe port
in the storm. What was the great
miracle that made Bobby so de-
sirable. and McCarthy poison?

There are several possibilities,

wt ich occurred to me:
(1) I didn’t actually see Mr. R..

I the Students for McCarthy lead-

er on television. I was still in a
stupor over Johnson's bombshell:

(2\) If I did see him. I misun-
derstood what he said about
switching to Bobby:

(3) Maybe after the big re-as-
assement meeting. the situation
will revert back to support Mc-
Carthy. or at least. some of his
active supporters will turn down
the suggestion to switch;

(4) Something must have hap-
pened to sour the student 1eader’s
(or leaders) enthusiasm for Me-
Carthy. Maybe this primary vic-
tories in New Hampshire and

Wisconsin a r e political poison
and are sure to jinx him:

(5) The whole this is. or was.
a big fat joke. This drum beating
for McCarthy was just a game to
see how many kids could become
interested in a so-called holy
cause.

If it was a game. or i_f student
leaders are so easily swayed by
one speech. then look out. you
Bobby fans. Think twice before
you change your tune. You may
switch to Rockefeller. On the
other hand. what makes the lead-
ers think it is now safe to back
Bobby? The war isn't over. John-
son may still be persuaded to re-
consider. Then. there is always
Hubert in the background.

  

Says Students
Playing Games

I admit to being one of those
“over-30" ones. with kids of my
own} going full-time. and holding
a job besides. I didn't work for
McCarthy and I have no right to
complain. However. even if I did
want to express opinions. how was
I supposed to hear about this
change? No one else with whom
I spoke heard about any reassess-
ment plans until the Pitt News
hinted about it in the April 3 edi-
tion.

Editor. The Pitt News:

The flaws in the policy of se-
lecting cheerleaders has come to
our attention following the selec-
tion of next years squad. We are
in strong opposition to two as-
pects of the policy. those being
the panel of judges and. secondly.
the “closed-door“ procedure.

 

For the past few _years. the pan-
el of judges has been composed
of representatives form the De-

 

   

partment of Physical Education.
several incumbent cheerleaders.
and a few “impartial" judges.
Several students who have tried
out for the squad are physical ed-
ucation majors. thus they have es-
tablished somewhat of a rapport
with the representatives from the
physical education department
before selections have been made.

Several of these same students
have established a personal rap-

port with the incumbent cheer-
leaders who serve as judges.
A casein point: a present sopho-
more cheerleader who was handi-
capped with a broken wrist dur-
ing tryouts. We can overlook her
handicap as the judges did. for
being a physical ed major with
several cheerleader friends on the
panel. she was quickly selected.

To add to this. the final selec-
tions are held behind closed doors.
where the student body cannot
witness and analyze the validity
of the selections. So let‘s look at
a case in point: Miss Donna Boone.
sophomore. majoring in Russian.

Was she not selected because
her cheerleading talents did not
qualify her for the position?

Donna is a native of Pittsburgh.
with several years experience in
cheerleading.

In her freshman year. she tried
out for the squad. Her talent and
experience took her to the semi-
finals where. at the last cut. Don-
na somehow did not make the
grade.

With this experience. she was
a sure bet to win a position on the
squad as a sophomore. Again Don-
na made it to the semi — finals

Friday, May 3, 1968 —- THE PITT NEWS — Page 7

 

where she was cut at the last mo-
ment for some reason. In analyz-
ing the situation. we feel she was
rejected. not because of her lack
of talent. but because she is a
member of the “Black minority.“

Therefore. we present the fol-
lowing demands: (1) The entire
procedure be open to the student
body for witnessing. (2) The pan-
el of judges consist only of mem-
bers of the faculty —— two of which
need be from the Physical Educa-
tion Department.

Candidates then can be judged
solely on individual merit.

' Contemporary Rock Music Belongs to the Fifties

by JOE ANDERSON

In view of the recent trends in
contemporary rock music estab-
lished by groups such as the Bea-
ties. the Stones. Doors and Coun-
try Joe and the Fish. it is hard to
rationalize th e appearance of
groups like Blood. Sweat a nd
Tears and the Electric Flag. Both
groups are composed of some of
the finest and most respected mu-
sicians in rock music today. Yet.
though each sounds well together.
they have both produced albums
which arein no way representa-
tive of the constant experimenta-

.tion and development of music

as an art which has characterized
the work of many of their con-
temporaries. Rather they have re-
verted to a style of music which
in the past has proven to be vap-

’ id and inapt.

Of course. there is noth i n g
wrong with adding a new touch
or taking a different approach to
an old style of music in hopes of
resuscitating lost enthusiasm.

But both the Electric Flag and
Blood. Sweat and Tears have fail-
ed to do just this. They have tried
to recreate the combination blues-

" soul music of thefifties when the

-a

., ‘'

appeal for that sort of thing has
just died out. They have both add-
ed incongruous brass and string
arrangements which give a very
unpleasant flavoring to an al-
ready dead sound. In addition.
neither group has a competent
or convincing blues singer — a
necessary precondition if one is

‘ to get to the soul of blues.

Child Is Father to the Man
(CS 9619) is the album by the
Blood, Sweat and Tears. Alan
Kooper, formerly of the Blues
Project, is the leader of Blood,
Sweat and Tears and is one of the
most versitle organ players in the
field of rock. Yet for all his tal-
ent he could no prevent his in-
strument from being overshadow-
ed on all to frequent occasions
by a pretentious “soul chorus”
and the inadequate brass arrange-
ments. In spite of its many faults
the album— does expire a slight
breath of promise.

Of particular note is the song
“Morning Glory” which would be
a really great song if it were not
for the rather disturbing brass
section. Of even greater promise
is “Meagan’s Gypsy Eyes” which
shows that the group is quite cap-

is almost zero!
Try it fast.
Why live in the past?

I Playtex invents the ﬁrst-day tampo”

(We took the inside out
to show you how different it is.)

Outside: it’s softer and silky (not cardboardy) .
Inside: it’s so extra absorbent. . .it even protects on
your ﬁrst day. Your worst day!

In every lab test against the old cardboardy kind. ..
the Playtex tampon was always more absorbent.
Actually 45 % more absorbent on the average
than the leading regular tampon.

Because it's different. Actually adjusts to you.

It ﬂowers out. Fluffs out. Designed to protect every
inside inch of you. So the chance of a mishap

able of producing a “modern"
song successfully. "The Modern
Adventures of Plato. Diogenes
and Freud” and “House in the
Country" again show what a com-
petent goup BS&T can be when
they so desire.

A Long Time Comin’ (CS 9597)
by the Electric Flag is an album

which proved to be a great dis-»

appointment. especially after the
enthusiastic response this group
received at_Monterey last sum-

~mer. Again the fifties sound is

the foundation for most of the
songs on this album and. as in
the case of the BS&T’s Child Is
Father to the Man, the record fal-
ters on this account. Thre brass
band arrangementsombined
with those of the blues guitar just
do not fit. One song in particular
“Wine" shows that this type of
song no longer has any appeal
and that the music itself. as long
as the Electric Flag insist on such
a strict adherence to the original

style. is doomed to a slow. costly
obscurity. Again. like the BS&T's
album. there is a sign of things
better to come on this record and
that is the song “Another Coun-
try” which shows that brass in-
struments are valuable tools when
placed in their proper context.

Mike Bloomfield of the Elec-

tric Flag refers to his groups as
an “American Music Band” and in
and American music band and so

are the members of the Blood

of the matter is that their music
is of and for the past. Today’s mu-
sic has left the fifties far behind
and though influenced by and in-

accepts the past as expressive of

THE NEW SCHOOL COLLEGE

 

is a senior college. lt offers the third and fourth years of the undergraduate
curriculum, leading to the B.A. degree. We accept liberal arts students
who have completed the equivalent of the freshman and sophomore years
elsewhere. We offer two programs—Humanities and Social Science. Half
the work in each program is done in DIVISIONAL COURSES which span
the traditional departmental boundaries in order to study the basic con-
cepts, methods and principles of the larger discipline. In addition to" the

, Divisional Sequence of courses each student works in a specialized area
and engages in a tutorial leading to independent study. The program cul-
minates in an Inter-Divisional-Senior Seminar. which examines the rela-
tionships between the disciplines of Social Science, the Humanities and the
Natural Sciences.

The juniors in the Social Sciences take
three Divisional ( year long) courses.
In the ﬁrst course the emphasis is on
a systematic analysis of a large (mac-
ro) social order — in this . case the
American culture. Readings include:
Paul Goodman, Drawing the Line;
Luckman and Berger, Social Mobility
and Personal Identity: C. Wright

Mills, selections; Parsons. The Link_

Between Character and Society; Car-
michael, What We Want; de Tocque-
ville, Democracy in America; San-
tayana, Character and Opinion in the
United States; selections from Freud
and Skinner; economic analysis by
Knight, Samuelson and Marx; and
political analysis in the terms of
Hume, Aristotle and Dewey. The sec-
ond course is in micro-analysis, i.e.,
an examination of subcultures seen
in relation to the larger community.
We read Glazer and Moynihan, Be-
yond the Melting Pot; Malinowski,
Kroeber, T. S. Eliot (Notes Toward
the Definition of Culture), Weber
(The Protestant Ethic), Erik Erikson,
Malcolm X, and more readings and
ﬁeld work on such subcultures as the
hippies, the poor and the black na-
tionalists. The third course is con-
cerned with comparative analysis-
specifically a comparison of US-
USSR, largely in terms of the social,
political and economic dimensions in
the process of industrialization which
have taken place, east and west. The
readings include case study material
as well as complex conceptual anal-
yses: Henderson, Ashton, Bendix,
Nef, Moore, Schumpter, and more.
All Divisional Classes for all students
are small. The major concern of the
classroom is to. analyze the readings.
Teaching is by discussion—a syste-
matic approach to each text.

The juniors in the Humanities also take three year long
courses. Working with materials from all of the arts and
philosophy these courses engage the student in various
modes of critical and interpretiveanalysis in order to
maximize the possibilities for signiﬁcant discoveries in
confronting the ‘vast range of works created by man's
intellect and imagination.

Here, as an example, are excerpts from last year‘s com-
prehensive examination. “The following texts all concern
themselves to a greater or lesser extent with the question
of human history, and the correlative question, the possi-
bilities for progress. Choose three of the following texts
and compare and contrast their treatment of these ques-
tions. Communist Manifesto; Reason and Experience
(Dewey); Structure of Scientiﬁc Revolutions (Kuhn);
Genesis; Antigone; Caesar and Cleopatra; The Sound and
the Fury.”. . .“2. One factor which would seem to distin-

is the drastically shifting conception of the heroic—not
only in terms of what the heroic indeed is, but also in terms
of what possibilities for heroism, still exist. Discuss this
quotation drawing evidence from Job; Phadre; The Strang-
er; Hippolytus; Marat/Sade; The Balcony; Billiards at
Half Past Nine.". . .“3. Using one of the following ﬁlms.
81/2, Wild Strawberries, Last Year at Marienbad, The
Knack, Ulysses, discuss in what sense the material (i.e.,
cinematic technique) affects the value judgments you make
of character, incident, and theme.”. . .“4. How do partic-
ular words or images control aesthetic responses in the
following poems: Leda and the Swan, The Lovesong of
J. Alfred Pru/rock, A Coney Island of the Mind.". . .“5.
Compare the role of coincidence in King Lear and Tom
Jones, indicating to what extent the nature of that role is
determined by the tragic structure of the one and the comic
structure of the other.". . .“6. In reading both philosophy
and arguments, language has been one of the most recur-
rent topics: Aristotle on diction in the Poetics, Plato on the
living word, Augustine on the Word that was in the be-
ginning, Unamuno on the birth of language in relation to
the tragic sense, Wordsworth and Coleridge on the rela-
tion of language to the minds of men, Freud on verbal
slips, and Heidegger, Camap, Wittgenstein and Chomsky
on philosophic issues bound up with language. Using at
least four of the above, write a brief essay on language
by indicating some key insight of each of the four and
discussing the scope of the problem (or values) language

University Plans to Liberalize Curriculum

by MARC SIMON

A variety of new courses will
be offered for the first (and prob-
ably last) time this Spring and
Summer. They are designed to
meet some of the existing require-
ments of the University, and are
also designed for those students
whose college lives have been led
in total ignorance. The courses
are as follows:

1) Cramming 101. Due to the
demand of students who have
come to the realization that sev-
en and half weeks is not enough
time to complete a 15 — week
course, a special course in the art
of cramming will be offered. The
credits for this course will vary
from three to five, depending on
how much time the student can
cram into it. It will be taught by
drop-outs who have profusely
practiced this art. The student
will be expected to supply his
own black coffee, no-doz. and
dex.

2) Pittsburgh Food Apprecia-
tion 180. This course of two and
one-half credits is designed for
the naive undergraduate who has
a lack of knowledge of the fine
dining facilities in the Oakland

Reflections
Richey Anxious to See
Mexico City in October;

AAAAAAA;AAAAA

by Roy Jacobs 
Sports Editor 

In seventh grade gym class Jerry Richey broke his
sehoo1’s record for crosscountry-runni'ng. He figured he
should go out ‘for the team. He hasn’t stopped running or
breaking records since.

Richey’s what you might call a super-soph. Of course,
two weeks ago he was a super-frosh. By that time he had
already broken‘ every Pitt track record above the half-
mile. Since gaining varsity status, Richey"s main accomp-
lishment was winning the two-mile in last weekend’s pres-
tigious Penn Relays.

The only problem was that the two-mile wasn’t pres-
tigious enough. . .

_ “The field really wasn’t classy,” reviewed Richey, who
nipped Villanova’s Bill Buerkle for the title. “It felt good to
win because of the name Penn Relays. It was the first big
meet that I won when I knew I might not win. Every other
big meet I’ve been in, I haven’t won.” i

It was a good win for him to get under his belt. Richey
was beginning to doubt himself after losing races to Gerry
Lindgrean and Sam Barr. And besides that, he’s,got some
even bigger meets coming up. ‘i

_ _ You see, the reason Richey is using up a year’s eligi-
bility now, rather than waiting for another year’s matur-
ity, is this burning desire he has to see Mexico City in
October. They say it’s beautiful there, especially in Olym-
pic City.

But there’s a lot of running ahead for Richey before.

he gets to Mexico City, and it’s not just road work through
the Liberty Tubes. There’s the N.C.A.A. championships in
mid-June, possibly the AAU’s the week after, and the Olym-
pic Trials, the week rafter’ that. Jerry’s main target now is
winning a spot as a 5000 ‘meter runner. But he prefers the
1500 meter race.

“I like the mile (and the 1500 meters), but I'm not
fast enough,” offered Richey. “Actually, I think the guy
that’s strongest wins, not the fastest. Strength is the key
to the finishing kick.

“I’1l spend all of May on speed work,” he continued.
“Right now I’m doing building work. 'I’ve never worked
this hard before. It’s like I’m coming from nowhere. I'm
really not strong enough or fast enough.”

His Relays’ time was 8:46.3, and cutting 15 seconds
from that would ‘possibly mean a new world's record.
Richey thinks that that is what he’ll need and that that is
what he can do.

Those last words, spoken by anyone else in the Oakland
-area, would be treated as heresy. They’.re even hard to swal-

"low coming from Richey himself. His winning time‘ in the

Relays was only one- tenth off the meet record, but Jerry
still feels that he’s got to cut another 10-15 seconds off of
that to cope with national competition.

“It depends on how hard I want to work,” says Richey.
“I think there's no limit to what ‘anybody can do.

“Actually, I don’t shoot for times. I compete. Times
come as sort of a bonus. If you’re in good competition, the
good time will be there. The only thing that means anything
is whether you’re first.” _ _

Smiling, Richey admitted he'd settle for a third if it
meant making the Olympic squad, but it’s hard to imagine

, him as anything except as that froznt-runner who made the

grade eat dust. ,

Spring Ball Rough

Spring football practice hasn’t been a picnic for 82
Panthers in its first two weeks, and the work isn’t about

to ease up any with the spring game only a week away.
Competition should intensify at most positions now that Dave Hart
and his coaching staff are starting to award some blue (first team)

 

jerseys. ,

Evidence of the hard work
can be seen daily at the Pitt
Stadium workouts, as several
gridders wear red jerseys which
signify an injury serious enough
to keep then out of contact work.
About 30 players missed Wednes-
day’s full-scale scrimmage.

“That's the only drawback of
Wedging it all into three weeks,”
remarked Hart. “An injury caus-

Tliinclads Set Mountaineer  Marks,

Await Saturday’s Quantico Relays ‘”

A by ED CONLEY

Bryant Salter was a fresh-

man.
Now, he is a sophomore;

 and it did not take the opposi-

tion in the Mountaineer Relays
two weeks ago, long to find out.

Salter took his first ‘shot at
the high jump in varsity C0mPe°
tition; he set the meet record. Be-
cause of the underrnanned squad,
Salter had to enter a second
event; he set another meet rec-
ord. This mark came in the tri-
ple jump.

These feats highlighted a strong
“re-opening” of the Pitt varsity
track team's schedule. The meet
was the first since the Temple
opener before the exam break.

Coach Jim Banner’s thinclads
came up with five meet records
that Saturday, one of the finest
afternoons for the varsity.

Another new member of the
squad, soph Jerry Richey, aided
in two of those marks. He was a
member of the record-breaking
sprint medley relay team that
also included “old-timers” Roger
Holly, Jack Neper, and Chet Wo-
jiechowski. The distance medley
relay‘ ‘entry was anchored by
Richey, as _ broke a meet mark,

  

 

BRYANT SALTER .
Sets Two Records

Wayne Bodenhier took the
javelin mark at the meet.

These performances made Ban-
ner’s comment, “I’m pleased‘.
their giving fine efforts,” sound
like quite an understatement.
These fine efforts turned into
“top-notch” results.

Tom Christie didn't break a
record, but he did win the 120

 

 

 

 

yard high hurdle title. He finish.-

attending the spring term to ex-
tend practice longer than three
weeks.

“So far, it’s the best spring
practice we've had,” he added.
“The weather's permitted us to
do more, and the additional coach-
es have permitted more individ-
ual work.”

The added coaches also free
Hart to go all around at practices
and supervise rather than be re-
stricted to coaching one segment
of the team as he had to do in
the past.

Another new aspect of spring
practice is more manpower and
more talent. All over, the sopho-
mores are pushing the veterans.
Bill Pilconis is battling senior
Skip Orzulak at split end and J .

D. Lewis is pressing junior Joe 

McCain at wingback. Two sophs
are in the thick of the fight for
the blue jersey at quarterback.

“It makes for a healthy situa-
tion,” said Hart. “Last year Mc-
Cain was our only wingback. He
learned a lot, but you can’t play
with just one man at a position.

“Tai1back is so much strong-
er,” he continued. “Dave Gar-
nett was hurt Monday, but boy,
did he look good. He showed he
could be a good football player.”
The quarterback situation is now
cloudy, but only because of a
wealth of material.

“Frank Gustine’s the veteran,”

offered Hart, “and he does little 

things he didlI’t do last year that
are good. Dave Havern’s looking
real good. He's quick, coachable,
and he adjusts fast. Mike Bran-
non has a strong arm and. he
throws well. We’ve been impress-
ed with him also.” ’

The hard work won’t let up un-
til after May 11, and even then,
the blue jerseys won’t be secure.

Hard Luck Hurts Baseball Team;
Football, Rain, Schedule Interfere

by JERRY L. GRUEBER
The Panther baseballers Won five of
the eight games they played since the win-
ter-term ended, bringing their overall mar-
gin to a disappointing, 8-7. But the near future
doesn’t seem to promise any improvement for the
hard-luck mitt team.
The hard-luck plague started for the baseball
team before the season ever started; but weather
prevented the mitters from practicing outdoors.

‘ Whn the Panthers finally got a chance to play, it

was in regular competition in the California Tour-
nament. ‘

The weather again plagued the mitters when
they returned to Pittsburgh, 3-4. The Indiana State
game was rained out and by the time they were
able to take the field again, almost two weeks
elapsed. The effect of the rainy weather was ob-
vious when the mitters were defeated by West Vir-
ginia, 4-0.

The baseball team was also unlucky with the
schedule. During finals week the mitters were
slated to play two games with the third-ranked

team in the country, Ohio State, and lost both ends
of the doubleheader, ‘I-1 and 5-0.

“That doubleheader should have never been
scheduled at the time that it was,” explained
Lewis. “The boys had their minds on their tests
and grades, not on baseball.”

But the baseball team’s troubles didn't end with
Ohio State. Now that finals are over, and the spring
term has begun, coach Dave Hart wants all his
players to practice for the coming season. And that
includes Frankie Gustine, George Medich, and Joe
McCain.

“McCain injured himself in football practice,
and when he is 0.K. he’ll be fighting for a position
on the starting team,” explained Lewis. “So I
don‘t think he'll be playing for us this year."

“Gustine and Medich really want to pitch, but
spring practice is hurting them,” said Lewis. “Me-
dich drove all the way to Gettysburg to pitch and
drove back the next day for football practice. He’s
had control problems because he's a little tight
from scrimmaging. Gustine will drive to West-
minster next week and drive back after the game.”

The golfers will attempt

“We haven't done very well

didn't get a chance to play them
because of rain, but the year be-

There is probably more to
Peery’s lack of confidence than
past performances against Buck-

ers competed against Youngstown,
Toledo, and Kent State.

“Not a man shot over 77 for
us,” moaned Peery, “but we still
finished last. That meant three
losses in one day.”

Youngstown copped first place
at Kent State on only 353 strokes;
Toledo finished second with 362,
Kent State third with 368; and the
golfers took 370 strokes.

But the golfers won their last

“That was a good match,” re-
viewed Peery happily. “There
were six matches each worth one
point, plus one point was given
for the medal score; we won, 4-3.”

Two come-from-behind victor-
tories enabled the golfers to win.
In the fifth match, Bill Bryan

And in the final match, Mike Mc-
