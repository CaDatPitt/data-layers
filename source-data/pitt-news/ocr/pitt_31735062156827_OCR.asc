 TII.E

VOL. 41-No. 14

Several Pitt Groups
Reap Chest Benefits,

Ninety-two campaigns in one, one annual appeal; :that’s
the Community Chest. Why give more? How are the contribu-
tions used? Here are the facts: _ . .

More than 75 per cent of the student contributions received
in the Pitt Chest remains on the campus, and it’s divided like
this: 40 per cent is for the YMCA and YWCA jointly, 20 per
centis for-the Men’s Student Loan fund, 10 per cent is for the
'Women’s Student Loan fund, 5" .

per cent is for Pitt in China.

After student activities have
received their sha.re, the rest
goes to the N ational;Red Featl1-
er Drive. The Pitt goal is
$15,500.

$4,947,023 is needed because
agency costs are up, because
costs of food, medicine, and
shelter are up from 20 to 30
per cent. Also, population isiup
100,000, requiring more family
services, nursing, clinical and
hospital care.

This year ’s budget is siniply
last. year’s budget at this year’s
prices. One hundred and twenty
men and women gave three
months of their time studying
community problems, agency
services and ﬁnances before the
goal was set:

Since one generous pledge of
$215,000 is not renewable this
year, a total increa.se of $1,151,-
642 is needed. That’s about 30
per cent over l.ast year.

Each individual,’ everybody
who possibly can, innstt increase
their pledges 25 to 30 p'er cent.
And everyone must give.

One out of every four famil-
ies beneﬁts from Red Feather

Own Drive
At Ellsworth

Ellsworth Center will have
their own Community Chest
drive along with the main cam-
pus on Nov. 5 and 6.

Following the wide program
of publicity going on at the
center, a 100 per cent response
is expected.

Plan of operation as disclosed
by the representative for Ells-
worth; Lewis A. Kaufman, will
be that the members of his com-
mittee will speak in their in-
dividual English classes.

“I believe that in this way all
students will be contacted, as
everyone has English at one
time~ or other,” says Kaufman.

The only exception topthe
rule will be for the Thursday
classes. At this timespecial rep-
resentatives will be sent to
classes. A special booth will .be
installed outside Room 201 to
collect all donations missed at
the classes. Speakers wil. be
equipped with red feathers and
envelopes for contributions.

A meeti.ng of all thespeakers
was held on the night of Oc-
tober 30. At this meeting, the
speakers were told the proper
method of delivery. All speak-
ers are student volunteers.

Speakers are as follows:
Thomas Speer, llerman , Clay,
Robert Lucas, John VVa.rg>etz,
Shelia Morod, Charles Solof,
Victor Schmidt, Edwin Moore,
Murray Rosenburg. John Rih-
tarchit, Frances. Sasso, and
Richard Martin.

 

 

 

Applications for positions on
Freshman Dance and Scholars
Day committees must be sub-
mitted to the office of the dean
of men before 5 p. m. tomor-
row.

Students interested in apply-
ing for positions of chairman,
business manager or publicity

or the chairmanship of Scholars
Day activities can obtain ap-
plications blanks at the office
of the dean of men.

Community Chest
Campaign Opens

What the best dressed men and women at Pitt will Wear
next week is a bright red feather, symbolizing that they have
contributed to the annual Community Fund drive.

This is not just another campaign. It is one single drive,
combining the pleas of 92 separate agencies into one time-saving,
money-saving appeal. Pitt’s share of the $4,947,023 Allegheny
county goal has been set at $15,500.

, Merits of the Community Chest are many

‘Standing in line for a coke in the Tuck

busy day. It takes four minutes for the average
smokerito consume a cigarette. However, in
less than 50 seconds, any one of the students

'7 can have an X-ray taken in the Schenley Room.
In the length of time that it takes to ride

the elevator from the Commons Room to the -

library a picture can be taken that will de-
termine whether or not a student has symp-
toms of tuberculosis, a disease that aifects one
person in every ten.

1 here who have tuberculosis and do not know it.
For a" total expenditure of less than one minute
of our time, and at no cost, it is possible to ﬁnd
out. It ’s worth it. - . _

Outstanding feature of this oﬂer by the

P S ’ United States Public Health Service is that the

ﬁndings are personal and conﬁdential to the in-
dividual concerned. Having... the X-rays taken
C involves no embarassment as it is-not necessary
to remove any clothes. Results of every case
will be sent by mail to the students.
Certainly with every detail simpliﬁed the

. . way it is, this campaign‘ should receive a hear-
, . ty response from the, University. Here is a

chance to get something for nothiiig. ‘We owe

i. it to ourselvefsfto take the chance. ‘

Beaux Arts Day
Bit by bit, tradition is coming to”Pitt. An
. institution slightly lacking" in ivy-covered

— ‘ walls will initiate another ceremony for fresh-

men women which will no doubt further the
cause of school spirit a great deal.
Chancellor Fitzgerald has been sponsoring

* an informal program which stresses school

spirit, an intangible thing which until recently
has been quite obvious in its absence at Pitt.
v Too often veterans and other students who have
come to school after the war have spoken about
theirL‘Alma Mater without vestige of pride.
S ,Beaux Arts Day is something Pitt needs.

It is regrettable that there is no activity of at‘

similar nature for male students ‘but now that
the hectic war years are past, some ‘effort
should bg made to smooth out student activi-
ties and Beaux Arts Day will help.

of Robert M. Hutchins, Chan-

cellor of the University of Chicago.

In an exclusive interview in Varsity, the young man’s ma'-
gazine, Chancellor Hutchinsprovides several answers to the
question: “VVhat’s wrong with America’s college and high

schools?” Foremost, he says, is
the trend towards specialization
that begins in even the -earliest
schooling years. “Students learn
how to raise poultry, ﬁle library
books, and predict the weather-
but they don’t get a sound cul-
tural background.

“Most schools,” the young and
militant educator told. Varsity,
“have over-lapping courses that
teach the same thing over and
over again. Or, at the other ex-
treme, they hammer away at so
small a segment of the subject
that they teach nothing at all.
Students learn one poem down to
the last comma—-but learn little
about poetry in general.”

In his own school, Hutchins de-
clared, students can be graduated
at eighteen or nineteen years of
age——-giving them time to special-
ize and receive doubly complete
educations by the time their
in other .colleges
have received their bachelor’s de-
grees. ’ s ‘ ‘

After reading of Henry Wallace’s offer to speak here, I
wouldappreciate forwarding this letter tothe committee con-
sidering his offer. - '
’ Regardless of anyone ’s opinion of this man, he is un-
questionably‘ worth hearing. Whether or not we believe what
he has to say, I believe We should be given the opportunity ;to

like, but don’t stifle his right to
‘speak. '

Mr. Wallace has served this
country for many years, in many
capacities. He is one of the lead-
ing political ﬁgures of our time.
As such, his opinion is to be re-
spected, or at least heard. Mr.
Wallace -made a generous oifer;
let’s take him up on it.

In fact, for the beneﬁt of anti-
Wallace thinkers, I suggest we
invite our own congressman John
McDowall (who has had’ plenty to
say about Hollywood lately) to
speak on the same day. I’d even
consider listening to him. in the

Curtain Goes

S’

Up Thursday

On Players‘ First '47 Show

By Dick Kovar

Pitt Players will ﬁnally hit the hay Thursday night when
the premier curtain of ‘George Washington Slept Here’ goes
up at 8:30 in Foster Memorial Hall.

In spite of the title, Director J. Harvey Pope promises that
the Players rendition of the laugh-a-minute Kaufman and Hart
dialogue will keep ﬁrst—nighters wide-awake for the entire

evening. . - A

Leading the cast are John?

Ingrim and Lucille Bodnar as
the urban couple who settle in
a ramshackle Pennsylvania
farmhouse -_ because ‘George
Washington slept in it.’

Ingrim recreates the come-
dian Jack Benny’s screen role
as the meek, lovable Newton
Fuller, while Miss Bodnar por-
Itrays hisshrewish spouse.

The play revolves around the
Fullers’ attempts to rebuild the
run—down farm while entertain-
ing a crowd of actor friends.

Complications arise when

they are threatened with the

farm ’s loss,’ but a third—act
twist ends the situation happi-
ly, with comical mix-ups thrown
in all along the line of events.

Jackie McKim plays the Ful-
lers’ daughter ‘Madge, with
John Forest as her New York

boy
leads as the actors from the city

friend. Supporting .the

and local characters are Bill
Claypoole, Nancy Mechling, J o
Basco, Mimi Cooper, Tom Ry-
an, Barbara Sarrof, Henry Szy-
minski, Harry Coss, Phil Sweet,
John de Haven, Doris Kalashe-
ski, Barbara Howard, and Paul

Return Loot

Students are showing a coop-
erative attitude toward Student
Congress’ campaign to right some
of the ‘wrongs done during the
Ohio State victory celebration last
Monday.

Several ﬂags and signs have al-
ready been returned and prom-
ises to return other acquired loot
have been made.

Student Congress is anxious
to reduce any antagonism which
may be felt toward the Pitt stu-
dent body as a result of our post-
victory push. Pittsburgh as a
whole wa.s tolerant of the out-
burst. Congress wants to retain
this sportsman like attitude so that
further student demonstration will
not meet with serious repercus-
ions. The Loot Recovery commit-
tee is pushing its program through
this week. ‘

Those who still have liberated
articles are strongly urged to re-
turn them to the students’ desk on
the ground ﬂoor, Cathedral.

No questions will be asked of
those returning articles. No pres-
sure will be put on students or
organizations. The committee
wants to do everything possible to
smooth over any difficulties.

Students who need transporta-
tion for articles being returned are
requested to call Mr. J. Edward
Ricart, ofﬁce of the Dean of Men,
or Herb Franklin, SC 9800.

Those interested in forming
an association for Johnstown

Reprisal Crews Frolic

At Stadium, [Cathedral

While Student Congress pleaded vainly for the return of trophies
liberated from Pittsburgh campuses and streets during last Monday’s
‘Pitt Putsch,’ reprisals from outraged students of Tech, Duqhuesne,

and even PCW and Mt. Mercy struck Skyscraper U last week, with

more rumored in the making.

Aside from a little water-throwing at Tech Monday, the ﬁrst

indications that Pitt’s collegiate
classes disturbed came shortly
after noon Wednesday. At least
one chemical bomb, undoubtedly
prepared in some CIT a1chemist’s
den, was hurled from the third
ﬂoor balcony, striking the ﬂoor of
the Commons Room and shower-
ing the area with a gas known in
ROTC manuals as ‘lachrymatory
anti-personnel gas.’ V

In the rush for air that followed,
the person or persons unknown
who were responsible for the das-
tardly attack escaped. Students
streamed out ODK walk, alter-
nately shedding tears and making
valiant efforts to keep their
lunches in place.

T ho u g h a decontamination
squad was rushed to the scene
by the Dean of Women’s oﬂice
with incense, the entire ﬁrst ﬂoor

and much of the upper floors

reeked for several hours after-
ward, while faint odors still per-
vaded the exposion area as late
as Friday.

Rumors of revenge by Techites
started not long after the ﬁrst Pitt
mechanized division hit the Skibo
campus Monday, prompting‘ Uni-
versity ofﬁcials to call for a spe-
cial detail of police that patrolled
the Cathedral until midnight every
evening last week.

Conﬁrmation of reports that

the Scotties had evil designs on

the local campus came when two

cousins objected to having their
A
Oakland gendarmes hauled a Tecli

students, variously reported as

James or Joe Roberts, from the
Stadium wall at 3 a. m. Friday.
At a hearing at 8:30 before Mag-
istrate Fiorucci of the local bas-
tille, Roberts claimed he was

merely looking over the arena in
preparation for a little whitewash-
splashing, and he was released. 1

An unofficial but often reliable’

authority claimed, however, that
Roberts was casing the joint in
preparation for a scheme. which
included the dumping of 500
pounds of rock salt on the play-
ing ﬁeld in the form of letters
spelling a four-letter word, the-
diminutive title of a local school
which was not believed to be Pitt.

The salt would have melted
quickly, burning out the stadium
grass to spell the name for spec-
tators at the next Pitt game. The
Roberts’ ﬁasco is reminiscent of
the whitewashing of the Tech
name on Pitt’s gridiron prior to

the whitewashing of the Skibo.

eleven by an outraged Panther
eleven in the 1943 contest.

Further rumors hinted of a joint
plot by students of the four minor
institutions of higher learning,‘
though thoughts of raids by PCW
and Mt. Mercy students failed to
arouse alarm here.

Lee I-Iershenson, sophomore
medical school student’who last
year won the deWayne G. Richey

average attained among medical

this year by winning two prizes,
the Mortimer Cohen Memorial
prize and the Nu Si.gma Nu award.
_ The Cohen prize is awarded to
the sophomore medical school stu-
dent receiving the highest average
in pathology, "while the Nu Sigma
Nu award goes to the member of
the same class establishing the

year.

Winner of the deWayne G.
Richey award this year is Emily
 Fergus, _ﬁrst year medical
school student. _All three prizes
are for $25 and are granted on the
basis of Work done during the past
year.

Both the Nu Sigma Nu award
and the Richey Memorial award
are offered annually by members
of the Nu Sigma Nu fraternity.
The latter prize is given in memo-

ly lecturer in medico-legal path-
ology who, until his ‘death, was
faculty‘ adviser of the Delta chap-_
ter of the Nu Sigma Nu fraternity.

given annually by the local chap-

ry of Mortimer Cohen who,:at the

¢plete or discontinue his training,

he should advise the office then

instead of waiting until he actual-
ly stops his training.

Failure to notify the oﬁfice of
the dean of men of training dis-
continuances usually results in
overpayments of subsistence al-
lowances. Such overpayments
must be refunded to the govern-
ment. —

Veterans who receive unearned
subsistence checks after interrupt-
ing or discontinuing their train-
ing must return all overpayments
to_ the government or make sat-
isfactory arrangements for re-
payment of the indebtedness.

VA said veterans who fail to
make arrangements to repay sub-
sistence allowance overpayments

‘may be prevented from reenter-

ing schools or job-training courses
under the GI Bill.

Emphasizing that veterans are
not being forced to turn back full
amounts immediately, VA ex-
plained that overpaid veterans
need only make arrangements
for monthly repayments that cause
them no ﬁnancial hardship they

‘thus become qualiﬁed to resume

their training.

Explaining that payment of gov-
ernment funds to persons indebted
to the United ‘States is prohibited
unless repayments are arranged,
VA said that veterans who receiv-
ed subsistence overpayments
would have the amount they owe
the government deducted from
unemployment or D self-employ-
ment allowances they might ap-
ply for after leaving training.
When such deductions are neces-
sary, every effort will be made to
avoid causing any veteran an un-
due hardship. «

urclue Tra nsformed
By   Holcom b's Magic
People around Indiana regard Purdue ’s head coach Stu Hol-

formed a mediocre team ,into a contender for the Big Nine
Championship. - ‘

The football outlook was far from rosey when he arrived
on the Purdue campus following Cecil Isbel’s resignation last
year. For Holcomb the change was drastic.

He spent his service—time help-
ing Colonel Earl Blaik turn out the
powerful, all-victorious West
Point champs. For this, he was
promoted to Pfc.

Material was scanty as the
classmate of Wes Fesler at Ohio
State took over as the Boiler-
maker boss. Only 25 players with
college football experience re-
ported for the ﬁrst-workouts.

Holcomb brought with him his
assistant coaches from his earlier
mentorships at Muskingum and
Findlay Colleges and set to work
to better the 1946 record, two wins,
atie, and six defeats.

The rebuilding Job began
around a few seasoned veterans.
Bob DeMoss and Harry Szulbor-
ski, the two ’46 backfield stand-
outs, were the nucleus around
which Holcomb piled his ball

makers. .

With Ed Cody gone, Jack Milito
took over the“ fullback s1_ot. Bob
Pfohl alternates with Milito. Out
of the rebuilding scramble came
Norbert Adams, a newcomer, to
run with Szulborski at the right
halfback position.

the surprising Purdues stand third
in the Big Nine standings with
three decisions over Conference
opponents in four games. They
made up for the loss to Wisconsin
by upsetting favored Illinois ‘two
weeks ago. _

Pitt, with the psychological ad-
vantage of last year’s bitter de-
feat, are eager to slap back at the
Boilermakers. '

The Panthers have an extra
week to concentrate for this.game.
Meanwhile, the Holcombmen will

slot. He is recognized as a crack
passer. even among such Con-
ference notable as Perry Moss, Bob
Chappius, and Al DiMarco.
Pittites remember Szulborski
for his hard running in last year’s
Purdue victory, 10-8. More im-
pressed in the Ihemo-ries of Pan-
ther partisan’s, however, is the
heart-breaking last—minute ﬁeld

In a game replete with errors, the Phi Gams smothered the Pi
Lams, 28-9, at Shadyside last Wednesday.

The last quarter was played in almost total darkness. The
Phi Gams took advantage of this to tally two points on a safety.
Adding to the confusion, the two¢
referees were undergoing thei
baptism as oﬁicials. '

The Pi Lams took an early lead
when, after the Phi Gams had
scored through the air, Mel Cohen
winged a 45-yard pass to Mort
Lerner. When the loser’s added
the point they took the margin,
7-6. "

In the second quarter, the Phi
Gams, under “General” Bob Hor-

Bill Frederick tallied the other
six-pointer on an intercepted

Barclay Chosen
Rifle Manager

 

For the ﬁrst time since the war,

"the University riﬂe teams will

have a student manager. Orzo

the military department as stu-
dent manager of the 1948 riﬂe
men‘.

The new .arrangement will re-
lieve team manager M/Sgt. James
Doherty, sergeant major of the
military department, of some of
the managerial duties.

It will give student managers a
chance to learn how a rifle team
is organized, equipped, entered
in competition and informed of the
outcome of the many posal
matches. ,

Under the new arrangement,
Captain James D. Hunter is of-_
ﬁcer in charge, M/Sgt Doherty,
the manager, S/Sgt. Watts Shab-
lowski, the coach, and. Ozro Bar-
clay, student manager of the riﬂe-

men.

School of Joumalsm“
Seen in Near Future

EVANSTON, Ill.--—(I. P.) -—.

School of journalism ultimately
will take their place in academic
and professional prestige with
schools of law or medicine, Ken-
neth E. Olson, dean of the Medill
School of Journalism of North-

western University predicted here-A

recently.

“I expect to live to see the day 2
when most programs in journal-

ism will be six years, and when
most of our schools of journalisrw
will be graduate professional
schools,” he declared.

“Newspaper men and women
daily prepare the food of publivx
opinion,” he continued. “In a de-
mocracy whose very existence de-
pends upon an intelligent and in-
formed electorate, they serve a
function more vital than any oth-
er profession. Is it not tremend-
ously important that young men
and women who seek entry to this
profession be given the best possi-
ble education and professional
training?” I‘

After explaining the broad, lib-
eral education necessary to equip
a newspaperman for his work, an«'
the program carried out in the
Medill school to provide that ed-
ucation in addition to training in
journalistic skills, Dean Olson as-
sailed the recent report. of the
Commission on the Freedom of
the Press which, he said, “after an
expenditure of three years in time
and $200,000" in money with the
naivete of ignorance, by implica-

tion condemned schools of jour-j

nalism. for not providing their
students with a liberal education.”

"It was apparent,” the dean
commented, “that the members
of this commission believed that
a student. in a ‘school of journal-
ism spent all four years, studying

nothing but reporting, or copy-‘

reading, or advertisind. Nothing

could be farther from the truth,i
but no member of this commission .v
ever bothered to find out what:
went on inside a school of jour-

nalism.
“Had any -member of this com-

mission taken the trouble to jour- 3
ney across the City of Chicago to’

this campus, he mig‘-ht have dis-

covered that what this report now 

so pontiﬁcally recommended had
been the established program in
school of journalism before the
commission itself was created.”

Tracing the history of the Me- 1

dill school, established in 1922
‘as a division of the School of
Commerce of the University, Dean

‘Olson pointed out that when itl

' became a separate school in 1938,
it was the first one to be organ-
ized on a proi":ession.al basis sim-
ilar to that underlying schools
oi‘ law and medicine.
