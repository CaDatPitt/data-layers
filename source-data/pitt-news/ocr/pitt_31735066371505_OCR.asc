A The solution ‘to the problem of
alcohol abuse on Pitt’s campus is not
to restrict underage students’ drink-
ing, according to Pitt education and

‘psychology professor Howard

Blane. To solve drinking problems
on college campuses, he said, stu-
dents should be taught how to drink
moderately.

Blane,‘ who presented these ideas
last month at a meeting ofthe Amer-
ican College Health Association,
speaks at a time when many colleges
are following a trend in efforts to
decrease the number of adverse
alcohol-related activities on
campuses.

In his most recent paper presented
at the colloquium, “Alcohol Abuse
on Campus: Do Education and
Awareness Programs Work?" Blane
suggested the following improve-

key to alc

ohol use

ments for alcohol awareness pro-
grams on campus:

0 Design programs on _college cam-
puses that teach students how to
drink moderately. One study
included in Blane’s presentation
gave results of a college newspaper
notice that said, “Tired of hangov-
ers? Learn how to drink without
them and still have fun." Students
who responded to the ad were shown
how factors such as body weight,
stomach contents, psychological
state, drink size and sip size may
affect them.

0 Restructure alcohol awareness
programs to reach heavy drinkers
instead of the current broad-based
program. This limited group is most

likely to include “problem drinkers,” .

according to Blane.

0 Lower the drinking age. Blane said
that Pennsylvania’s high legal drink-
ing age presents a challenge to the
freshman drinker. “College students
are notoriously and rightly sensitive
to issues of fairness and justice, indi-
vidual ‘rights, and the balance
between individual freedom and
social control,” said Blane.

0 Uphold traditions that are some-

times the most time-honored posi-

tive aspects of college drinking.
Blane includes in this category
student-faculty get-togethers which
serve an additional purpose of
allowing the faculty member to be a
role model.’

Increased media coverage of alco-
hol use, a growing trend toward
healthiness, and cost-consciousness
of universities are factors that Blane
cites as contributing to alcohol
awareness programs on college cam-
puses today. Yet he warns, “Today’s
concern and urgency about student
drinking problems contain a whiff of
moralism that students are quick to
detect and, whether they drink or
not, are quick to resent.”

Driving after heavy drinking
Missed class due to drinking

Blacking out

Getting into physical fights
Automobile accidents
Other accidents

Adverse behaviors associated with drinking in college:

Doing things one would not do when sober
Spending money set aside for other things
Getting in trouble with authorities

Damaging property or setting off false fire alarms

. In response to recent moves to
include Pitt School of Medicine
faculty in a possible university-
wide election on collective bar-
gaining, the United Faculty(UF)
union last week filed formal
charges of,unfair labor practices
against the university admin_is-
tration.

The Pennsylvania Labor Rela-
tions Board (PLRB), which ear-
lier this month had postponed
public hearings on the faculty
unionization issue, has sche-
duled hearings on last week’s
charges for next Thursday and
Friday and June 12-15.

The charges were announced
in a Thursday news conference
by UF president Philip Wion, an
English professor, who accused
administrators of illegally coerc-
ing medical faculty members into '
dissolving their collective bar-
gaining organization, the
Faculty Association of the
School of Medicine (FASM), as
a way of blocking the organizing
efforts of UF in the provost’s
area.

United Faculty is the organi-
zation seeking to bargain collec-
tively for faculty in the provost’s
area. University administrators
have consistently argued that a
bargaining unit including only
the provost’s area is inapprop-
riate because it excludes faculty
in law, medicine and the health-

Unfair labor practices at Pitt?

related professions. The admin-

istration opposes faculty
- unionization as not in the best

interests of the university or the
" faculty.

Referring to a series of depart-
mental meetings held last month
at the medical *school which
resulted in the PLRB’s de-
certifying the FASM as a legal
bargaining agent, Wion said, “I
think this was an effort to steam-
roller the unionizing effort and_
to do away with it once and for
all.” ‘

Wion said the referenda by
which Pitt physicians voted 341
to 194 to be included in a unit of
all Pitt faculty in a possible col-
lective bargaining election were
initiated not by the doctors but
by administrators. He called the
atmosphere surrounding the
referenda “an erroneous and
biased situation where people
with power over them [the medi-
cal faculty] were giving them
biased information.”

A printed statement released
by UF Thursday said, “In April,
university administrators called
medical faculty to suddenly
arranged department meetings, ._
with no agenda announced. At
these meetings top administra-
tors, including Senior Vice-
chancellor for the Health
Sciences Nathan Stark and Edi-
son Montgomery, from the
chancellor’s office, along with
university attorneys, pressed ,
faculty members to vote for a

resolution indicating they would
like to give up theirvseparate bar-
gaining unit...”

Officials on both sides of the
issue have predicted that a large’
majority of medical faculty-will
vote against unionization in any
election, which would probably
kill the prospects of a UF victory
if all Pitt faculty are included in a:
common bargaining unit by the
PLRB. ,

Pitt biochemistry professor
Robert Glew of the School of
Medicine announced at the news
conference that he had filed legal
charges of his own against the _
university, in collaboration with
the UF action. Glew explained
what he sees as the viewpoint of
most of his colleagues.

“The medical school faculty is
extremely anti-union. That’s
what the chancellor is banking
on. About three-fourths of the
medical school faculty are physi-
cians.... There’s a strong entre-
preneurial attitude which is
defended, enjoyed by the faculty.
They’re in a position to self-
remunerate," Glew said.

University attorneys David
Sullivan and Ronald Talarico
were not reached for comment
on the charges; however, Sulli-
van said the university acted
properly and the UF has no legal
standing in decisions involving
the medical school, according to
an article Friday in The Pitts-
burgh Press.

Opinions --—-—

HcIzard’s corner/Jomes M. Crory

On conscience...

Have you got a conscience? If so,
consider yourself lucky, because not
many people do anymore. The
world is raging with silly and corrupt
people who want more than they
need, and needy people who want
iust enough to get by. Housing
industries have been developed
which could house the entire popu-
lation of Brazil for the cost of her

military budget, yet still they arm for

arguments and hatred.

Where does it end? Last weekend,
at the tomb of the unknown soldier,
Ronald Reagan called a battered
corpse the “heart, spirit and soul of

America." Is this what we call hope?
If this is our spirit and soul, what
hope is there? People do work hard
in this country, most just to get by,
but the working folks have been
abandoned by the intelligentsia.
Working can lead us to a useful goal;
the technologies exist for the entire
planet to prosper; low—energy,
highly efficient housing, transporta-
tion and farming.

Instead of resenting people who
cannot find work and sending them
to war against fabricated enemies,
wouldn’t it make sense to create
training programs in order to build a

viable inlrastucture? Everybody
wants to have freedom and integrity,
but being part of a community is
inescapable, except in the freedom
of death. Each person must change
himself, and this cannot be forced on
a human being.

Work for the preservation of life
on this planet, and perhaps we shall
find an enduring future for the
planet. Otherwise, we must continue
on the sad journey to irretrievable
destruction through poisoned soil
and bitter angst. Isn’t life worth a
little effort?

On conscientious objection

While that senile old man in the
White House chants and drools over

his schemes for war, shouldn’t we ,

consider what a total waste war will

be? The institutions of this country ‘

really are not in touch with reality.
The closest we come to any real com-
mitment to wholesome values is
incomplete, but this is on the issue of
conscientious-objector status.
Before anything else, here’s the
conscientious-objector situation
and why it’s so important: some peo-
ple will not fight in war because they
have a rare human quality known in
English as “conscience.” Mainly, it is
associated with religious values, but
any “dove,” even one who is not

the draft is a bad law. Allergies,
knock-knees, heart murmurs, ner-
vous conditions and so forth will
help strengthen your position.

subject. The theme is clear: it takes
courage to stand up to one’s country
when it is wrong.

Probably every religious group in
the world has organizations ready to
help conscientious objectors. The
issue is confusing, highly technical
and often contradictory. Seek help
now, before the deadline aproaches.

Above all, risk having conscience.

OK, it’s time to peel the cob-

went on to write as well as per-
form the 1972 monster hit “Hold

about Russ Ballard?

With a distinguished song-
writing career behind him, Bal-
lard has decided to ﬂing himself
back into the musical arena in
l984. The result? He exits in
shreds. This self-titled lp flound-
ers in its own aimlessness, amid
time-worn riffs and a generic
quality that withholds any sense

   

of freshness.

Some nicely executed guitar
breaks are the album’s only
plusses; it’s a shame, however,
that Ballard’s clean and compe-
tent vocals are diminished by the
trivial nature of this record.

Jndiano rides again

By Jamey sewold
Staff Writer

The scene, somewhere in India,
I935. The irrepressible archeologist
Dr. Indiana Jones and his two tag-
alongs -—— the voluptuous showgirl-
turned-adventurer Willie Scott and
half-pint squire Short Round —— are
perched high atop a cavern wall
overlooking a horrifying ceremony
of evil. Indiana’s face glistens from
the heat of the moment as his eyes
meet those of the lady. She touches
him plaintively.

Willie: (with passion) You’re
gonna get killed chasing after your
damned fortune and glory.

Indiana pulls her close and raises
one corner of his mouth in a smile of

, confidence.

«W

_ faced with

Indiana: Maybe  but not today.

They kiss. (Music up full.) A short
pause, and he’s off.

Feel like hanging from a cliff or
two this weekend? Perhaps bailing
out of a pilotless plane without a
parachute is more your style. No?
Like to be poisoned, flogged and
shot at with a variety of weapons,
only to arrive home safely with a
grin on your face and a voracious
appetite?

You say, “Oh no,_not another one
of those mindless swashbucklers
that mesmerize kids but lack the
stuff that great minds feed upon.”
Well, if it’s brain food you want, go
eat fish, because Indiana Jones and
the Temple of Doom is simply en-
ter-tain-ment.

From the very beginning, we are
the classic struggle
between the forces of good and evil,
and it isn’t hard to figure out which

is which in this film. Black is black, V

white is white and Indy is Indy is
Indy. (Love it!)

By sheer happenstance (how else) ’

the trio of Indy, Willie and Short
Round find themselves together in
downtown Shanghai. In his quest
for fortune and glory, Indy once
again makes a deal that should net
him the gem of his dreams. How-
ever, the deal is nixed by a group of
the most sinister-looking villains
since the days of Fu—Manchu and
Dr. No.

The result is a madcap scramble
amongst a bevy of Shanghai dancing
girls, with Indy scrounging about
calves and thighs in search of the
jostled vial of antidote for his most
recent poisoning, and Willie in fev-
erish pursuit of the gem. Sound

grandiose? Everything is done on a

similar scale. BIG.

And BIG is what Steven Spielberg
and George Lucas do best. Two of
the most commercially successful
filmmakers of all time, could this
duo produce anything short of vis-
ual splendor? The question is ans-
wered in the form of of this
collaborated effort, a film absolutely’
packed with imagination and raw
action.

Concocting thrills and spills for
an audience of seasoned adventure
afficionados is no small task.
Whether it’s swooshing down a
snowy mountainside in a rubber raft
at more than 100 mph or hanging
precariously from a hemp strand of
a snipped footbridge hundreds of
feet above a raging Indian river, the

cinematography and visual effects
are stunning. Credit Spielberg for
maintaining this film, its rapid pac-
ing and visual extravagance always
threatening to spin out of control.

Surprisingly enough, however,
some of the most captivating
moments in the film are not of the
kind that make you grab your seat
and spill your Milk Duds. Ke Huy
Quan’s portrayal of lndiana’s youth-
ful Oriental sidekick Short Round is
so natural and unaffected that he
virtually steals every scene from
Harrison Ford. Short Round, a
street-wise orphan who scurries
about wearing a beat up New York
Yankees baseball cap and projects a
no—nonsense way of dealing with
Ford's calm and cool Indiana, pro-
vides the film with most of its effec-
tive comic relief (and time to catch
your breath).

And_what of Willie Scott (played
by Kate Capshaw), the blonde
maiden who aims at achieving riches
via her sexuality and eventually
comes to love Indy? She’s a problem.

How many times have we seen the
lady in frills fall from a horse into a
mud puddle or frightened by a bug,
to the amusement or chagrin of her
male travel mate? OK, so this time
she takes a spill from an elephant
and is scared by literally billions of
bugs. Same thing. The character
hinges on being ridiculous too often
to be overlooked, but too often to be
accepted, as well.

Overall, this sequel to the box
office smash Raiders of the Lost Ark
is cohesively as strong as its prede-
cessor and, at times, even more fan-
tastic; But, in places the films
attempts at the extravagani and
bizarre may be too violent for
younger viewers — a bit too shock-
ing. The thrilling atmosphere
created by Spielberg would not have
suffered at all had they spared some
of the gore. But, then again, Indiana
Jones begins with Willie’s high step-
ping performance of Cole Porter’s
“Anything Goes,” and I suppose

_ that in quest of a sacred stone with

magical powers, anything does.

PAGE 6/THE PITTSNEWS SUMMER MAGAZ|NE/ COVER STORY

By Mark A. Slndler
Staff Writer

Jeff Muller is not the typical
American college student. He has
received upwards‘of $6,000 a year in
federally-subsidized student aid
while attending Yale and calls him-
self a member of the middle class.

There is something more to
Muller, however, than meets the eye.
In these times of unrest in the Per-
sian Gulf, other pans of the Mideast
and Central America, this senior
strongly opposes the use of U.S. mil-
itary force in these areas.

Muller is a non-registrant with the
Selective Service System and
unafraid to admit it. He calls himself
a “public non-registrant,” and he
and others have publicized this fact
through the Campaign Against Mil-
itarism and the Draft, a New Haven,
Conn.-based group. Muller
explained that there are many more
like him in the United States.

Uncle Sam is out to punish them.

D E El

Two years ago, Rep. Gerald
Solomon (R-N.Y.) introduced an
amendment to the Defense Authori-
zations Bill of l983 seeking to deny
educational aid to male college stu-
dents who did not register with the
Selective Service. A second prong of
that amendment also denied 18-
year-old males born after 1960 job
training skills if - they failed to
register.

Solomon Amendments I & II
became law in the fall of 1982, after
both the House and Senate over-
whelmingly passed the measures.
Since then, these amendments to the
Military Selective Service Act have
been tied up in court.

“When we found out about the
Solomon Amendments being
passed, we looked into them,
researched them and found the idea
unconstitutional,” said Gail Such-
man, an attorney with the Minne-
sota Public Interest Research Group
(MPIRG). \

Suchman, in concert with the
Minnesota Civil Liberties Union
(MCLU), brought suit on behalf of
six anonymous males against the
Selective Service November 23,
1982. ’

U.S. Federal District Court Judge
Donald Alsop ruled that the
Solomon Amendments were uncon-
stitutional in June I983 and ordered
a permanent injunction against the
use of the amendments. A tempor-
ary injunction had been granted on
March 9.

The U.S. Supreme Court stepped
in, stayed the injunction and heard
arguments from both sides last
month in MPIRG et al. vs. Selective
Service System. The nine justices are
expected to rule on claims of dis-
crimination and violation of bill of
attainder, among others, by the first
week of July.

While waiting for the Supreme
Court’s decision, universities across
the nation continue to withhold stu-
dent aid to eligible males who refuse
to register.

E] El Cl

Outcry against the Solomon
Amendments centers around the bill
of attainder, where Congress
bypasses the judicial system and
passes legislation that determines
guilt without benefit of a trial.
Opponents have denounced the
amendment on the grounds that it
discriminates in favor of more afﬂu-
ent male students.

By Lisa B. Keer
Senior Editor

The Solomon Amendment has
stirred debate among university
financial~aid panels, torn between
assisting needy male students and
obeying Selective Service dictates.
The debate is not limited to dollar
amounts, however.

The Solomon Amendment has
raised questions of its constitution-
aiity and of discrimination against
the less affluent college male.

“The Solomon Amendments vio-
late students‘ rights against incrimi-
nating themselves,” Suchman said.

“This brings up very important
issues. The bill of attainder has been
argued very few times in the history
of the United States."

“They’re saying we’re being pun-
ished for not registering for the
draft, which they are calling a
crime,” added Jim Feldman, legal
counsel for the Central Committee
for Conscientious Objectors
(CCCO) in Philadelphia.

“The Supreme Court has found
similar laws unconstitutional after
the Civil War. Southerners who
practiced law or medicine or were
priests were requiredto sign oaths of
loyalty to the United States govern-
ment. It's similar here, [in that] you
have to sign a loyalty oath that you
registered for the draft."

Solomon Amendment I affects
programs provided under Title IV of
the Higher Education Act of I965
and any amendments added to it
since.

The programs include Pell
Grants, Supplemental Educational
Opportunity Grants (SEOG), Col-
lege Work-Study (CW-S), National
Direct Student Loans (NDSL),
Guaranteed Student Loans (GSL),
PLUS Loans (to parents) and State
Student Incentive Grant Programs.

Bank loans guaranteed by the fed-
eral government are also affected.

Each university follows a federal
mandate that all applicants confirm
their selective service eligibility on
financial aid forms.

A student cannot claim conscien-
tious objector status as a reason for

.not registering. Groups exempt

from registering include females,
males under 18, those who have been
on active duty with the armed servi-
ces and foreign students.
According to Joan Lamb, Public
Affairs Director for the Selective
Service, the Solomon Amendments
have halved the number of non-

registrants since their inception on _

Oct. 1, I983.

Lamb estimates there are 375,000
non-registrants, with l2.l million
males already registered, a 97 per-
cent [compliance rate.

One and a half years ago, only 75
to 80 percent of eligible males had
registered.

“In the beginning, when the Selec-
tive Service first started [I980], eligi-
ble men showed ignorance of the
requirement, but now they seem to
exhibit ignorance ofthe seriousness
of the requirement," Lamb said.

“The Solomon Amendments

really educate men in what their

rights and responsibilities are to reg-
ister. The bill's sponsor, Gerry
Solomon, wasn't too familiar with
the Selective Service until he asked
his son whether he had registered
yet,” Lamb recalled. _
“He hadn’t the time. So
[Solomon] pushed the amendments
as an awareness message. It has
resulted in more registrants. It is not

' intended to deny anyone their edu-

cation. When they have a responsi-
bility to their country, they
shouldn‘t shun it.”

Cl C] U

The amendments have made

many people aware. The Solomon
Amendments have personally
affected Jeff Muller. Last year, as a
junior, Muller lost his $2,500 loan,
$2,500 grant and $1,000 work-study
subsidy “because ofan infringement
on my basic rights.”

Muller is among the more tortu-

nate students. Because he is a .

Quaker, the religious group has

helped reimburse his grant, while

Yale helped him to get a commercial

bank loan with a 12.5 percent inter-

est rate (as opposed to the standard 9
P°_T $311!) $0 help pay his near $14,000
tuition bill.

Others do not have as many alter-
natives as Muller, like another col-
lege student who only identified
himself as “Allen.”

_ Attending what he termed a small
liberal arts college in Massachusetts,
the ]Unl0I' has already had his GSL
denied him because he has refused to
register. Though Allen has taken out
commerical loans so far, he expects
it will be difficult to cover tuition
next year should the Supreme Court
uphold the amendments.

‘It’s certainly clear that the fed-
eral government is punishing people
without a trial, which is what this
amounts to -violating one‘s Con-
stitutional rights,” Allen said_
“Solomons argument is that educa-
tion benefits are not a right guaran-
teed by the ‘Constitution.

“He’s missing the point that
whether or not that’s true, you can-
not punish someone without a trial.”

E] E] D

Several colleges from coast to
coast have helped ease the burden on
students both qualified for financial
aid as based on need and unwilling
to register.

Two Ivy League schools, Yale and
Harvard, have joined Pennsylva-
nia’s Swarthmore and Haverford
Colleges, Indiana’s Earlham .Col—
lege, Stanford and the entire Univer-
sity of California network in
offering interest-bearing loans for
non-registrants.

“Yale, partially under our own
[CAMD] pressure,, then through its
own impetus,- said it would have
nothing to do with the law and sub-
sidized those students affected by
the Solomon Amendments,” Muller
explained. 6

“I wouldn’t call [Yale] fence-
sitters because they feeldifferently
about the draft itself than they do
about the law. They are trying to

‘distinguish this law from registra-
tion,” he said.

Muller believes the amendments’
purpose is to punish non-registrants
and encourage registration.

“I’m very concerned about a law
like this because it‘s an infringement
on my basic rights,” Muller said.
“It's stepping all over you. The run-
ning joke lately is you’ll need to
prove your registration to gain
admittance to a national park.

“I don't know how to explain it. A
group of people is being singled out
for something characteristic of
themselves. But before they’re con-
victed to deny them student aid?
That, to me, is a problem,” he said.

“When has there been qualifica-
tion in the past [for financial aid],
except for need?”

El D U

Joan Lamb opposes the argument
against the use of the bill of
attainder, explaining that no one is
being convicted of a crime but
merely being denied student aid for
failing to register with the Selective
Service.

Wisdom

MA\/3%, 19

°.'.

“Violation? Not at all,” Lamb
continued. “All you have to do if you
don’t register but want student aid is
register with the Selective Service.
The situation here is that no one is
being convicted of a crime. No one is
forcing you to get a loan.

“I liken this to when a minor goes
into a bar and asks the bartender for
a beer. The bartender then asks for
proof of age and upon ﬁnding none,
refuses to serve the person beer. No
criminal action is taken.”

Currently, there is no way to
verify Selective Service registration,
although the Department of Educa-
tion will begin enforcing that in 1985
through cross checks of ﬁnancial aid

‘applications against Selective Ser-
vice registration records. In the
meantime, the DOE will carry out
spot checks.

While Lamb believes the amend-
ments do not discriminate against

the poor, she notes another type of .

discrimination — against those who
do register.

“Around eight billion’ dollars a
year-are spent on grants, loans and
work-study programs for college

students,” Lamb disclosed. “I don't.

think that the taxpayers in this
nation want to subsidize people who
are evading the law. If there’s any-
thing discriminatory, it‘s against
those who refuse to abide by the
law.”

Allen, a product of 1960s anti-war
activist parents, does not view him-
self as a lawbreaker.

“The problem with that lies in the
belief that taxpayers really want
men to ‘defend their country,‘ ” he
said. “It is clear from public opinion
polls that we don‘t want that action,
which right now would most likely
take place in Central America. The
draft makes taking that action all the
more easier."

“It’s clear to see that when you ask
people to fulfill a responsibility to
government, you do so at a personal
cost, or at least an inconvenience,"
said John Kostas, a spokesman in
Solomons Washington, D.C.,
office.

“What had to be done in this case
was making sure that the law be met
uniformly, not haphazardly.“

“Those who don‘t register are
actually discriminating against
those who do. The pool of registers
would have remained smaller and
funds would still go to those who
don‘t register. So the representative
acted out of a sense of fairness.”

Jim Feldman, attorney for the
Central Committee for Conscien-
tious Objectors, finds several unfair
implications in the Solomon
Amendments.

has the option of avoiding registra-
tion since he does not fill out univer-
sity aid forms, which require the
applicant to state that he has indeed
registered with the Selective Service.

Pitt American history professor
Van Beck Hall was torn when asked
for his reaction to the amendment.

“One half of me says it shouldn‘t
be. The other says the criteria should
be as tough as possible  for all.“

Hall pointed out that many Amer-
icans still have painfui memories of
Vietnam. He mentioned that both

Presidents Johnson and Nixon were
loath to use older reservists for com-
bat duty because it would have
“killed them politically."

“Of course, very few [college stu-
dents] actually served," during Viet-
nam, Hall said. “This harks back to
the days of college deferments."

Hall felt a more equitable registra-
tion system could be devised. He
said that if everyone, including
females, were required to register
with the Selective Service. enthusi-
asm for U.S. military actions in

other parts of the world might abate.
Pitt history professor Peter

. Karsten believes that there are “large

factions of the population whose
families are not enthusiastic" about
a possible draft.

Both professors did point out that
a registration does not mean that the
U.S. administration in power would
be able to intervene in a foreign
crisis.

“It would be difficult to return to a
draft because Congress would have
to take additional steps to create a

)ponent of

the Solomon Amendment, feels that
enforcement of registration is “a step
towards a draft."

McColloch believes that registra-
tion is the first step to war and fears
another Vietnam will occur in ‘Cen-
tral America. “What are we register-
ing for?" he asked.

He is alsothinksthatthe Solomon
Amendment will discriminate
against the less well~off student.
“They will always be able to do bet-
ter,“ he said.

He fears that some states will pun-
ish job training program applicants
for not registering, even though they
really did not break any laws.

Feldman believes that Uncle Sam
is turning universities into “police
organizations.” ,

“It’s wrong to force or require a
university to be law enforcement
agencies,” he continued. “It’s diffi-
cult to serve as an educational func-
tion when you’re a police body. It
limits the people in their student
bodies.

“It also infringes on academic‘
freedom that universities cannot dis-
criminate on several bases against
people [on the basis of race, color,
religion, ethnicity, national origin,
age, sex, marital, veteran or handi-
capped status]. That’s a precept pro-
tected by the First Amendment -
no government can interfere in who
students are.”

Feldman wants more reasons
available for male students seeking
to avoid registration, including a
conscientious objector category.
People holding such beliefs usually
gain “CO" status at the classification
stage of a wartime draft.

In defense, Lamb said, “Theyre
talking about classification as a con-
scientious objector, and notice thatl
used the word ‘classification.’ This is
not a peacetime draft. All they have
to do is register with the system.

“Suppose people did not con-
scientiously want to abide by traffic
lights,” she continued. “There are
people today who in their good con-
science feel it’s not right to pay taxes.
If people put their conscience before
everything, you would have a total
state of anarchy.”

D 1:] [3

Although he admits his reaction
may have been different five or more
years ago, Dr. Joseph A. Merante is
not surprised that none of the l8,000
male and female Pitt—Oakland stu-
dent aid awardees did not sign the
compliance form last year.

But Merante, Pitt’s director of
admissions and student aid, remains
skeptical about Solomon Amend-
ment 1.

“You have to understand that the

form discriminates against those.

who don’t have financial need,
meaning that those who have to sign
needed the aid," he said. “If you’re
from a wealthy family, [then] you
don’t need to sign.”

Merante does not equate any uni-
versity with a law enforcement body
but did express difference over how
the Selective Service is nabbing non-
registrants.

“We felt that if they were going to
do it, they would do it for everyone,”
Merante said.

“If youre wealthy, why don't you
have to fulﬁll the civic responsibility
as compared to someone not as well
off?

“Somebody has to make a deci-
sion whether everybody I has to
[come under uniform compliance}.
There are more students out of col-
lege than who are in college. There
are more population segments to
choose from or look at.”

To keep approximately 5,000
males turning 18 everyday aware of
their obligation to register, the
Selective Service mails information
packets, airs public service messages
and stuffs utility bills with notices.

To get as close to 100 percent par-
ticipation as possible, Lamb com-
mented, the Selective Service also
cross-refers its computer tapes with
the Social Security Agency and the
Internal Revenue Service. Once the
cross-reference lists are obtained,
each state’s bureau of motor vehicles
is contacted to update addresses and
other information.

The Selective Service also pur-
chases and uses commercial sub-
scription lists.

It is not the address or the social
security number that Jeff Muller
worries about because those are eas-
ily found, he said. . A

The item most difficult to get is
the registrant’s signature, verifying
his name on the draft list. He finds
the Solomon Amendments the most

I convenient way to get that.

“Registration is an effective way
of working for reinstatement of the
draft,” he said. “My brother worked
as a military strategist for a con-
gressman from the west [1981-82],
and they kept discussing the draft
bill in 1982. But you can’t have one if
so many people haven‘t registered. It
points to the ludicrousness of the
system. ,

“When you talk about registra-
tion, you’re talking about readying
to make a contribution,” Muller
continued. “I believe I have a
responsibility not to contribute.
Registering is a contribution. Itis
part of the process of killing people.”

While various federal agencies
cross-reference information, the
Justice Department also sends non-
registrants letters alerting them to
their delinquency. Allen has
received several of these notices,
some threatening indictment.

“The letters get increasingly hos-
tile," Allen said.“It’s a sneaky, dirty,
underhanded way" of doing things.
The letters are another reason peo-
ple feel compelled to register. Unless
people benefit from draft counsel-
ing, they don’t know this is all a big
crock. They get scared, and I guess I
would, too, ifl didn't know any bet-
ter. It’s a powerful sort of thing.”

to register for Civil War duty on the
Union side. Three years of service
were required, although draft could

Chronology of the draft

CLUM tabled the suit when B.U.
stopped enforcing Solomon
Amendment I.

While awaiting the Supreme
Court's decision, both sides involved
predict victory.

“I want to stress that, after hear-
ing the arguments presented, that
the Supreme Court will uphold the
law as constitutional,” Soloman
spokesman John Kostas said.

“That will have a positive impact
in that states can pass equivalent
laws for giving out aid. It's been
argued by the U.S. Solicitor General
[Rex Lee] that, by denying govern-
ment beneﬁts, punishment does not
evolve. The benefits are simply
denied."

“It would be tremendous defeat,”
attorney Gail Suchman said of the
possible ruling. “It would be of terri-
ble precedential value. Congress
would then have all ways of passing
federal laws discriminately hurting
just about anyone.

“If someone wanted to apply fora
driver's license, Congress could say
that would be subject to that per-
son’s taxes being in order for the
past five years,” she said.

“There is no end to what could
happen. Fishing licenses, FHA
loans. You would have to come for-
ward to prove all innocence and if
not, there is presumed guilt. Con-
gress would be able to sidestep the
criminal justice system,” Suchman
added.

“I think it’s very realistic. There

are plenty of people like Gerry

    

Solomon in Congress who think
that way right now.”

Merante harbors other concerns.
Pitt traditionally awards upperclass-
men student aid in late spring and
early summer. Should the Supreme
Court rule against the Selective Ser-
vice, then those not receiving aid
because of non-registration would
suddenly become eligible.

An opposite ruling could signifi-
cantly slow Pitt’s processing of
freshmen applications.

:1 D D

Jeff Muller's beliefs are so deeply
ingrained that he anticipated spend-
ing two years in jail and relinquish-
ing a college education for not
registering. That never happened to
him. He thinks it can and will
happen to others.

He is active in CAMD to stand up
for the rights of others, as he puts it.
Besides the tuition he surrenders, he
doesn’t want to “pay” for his educa-
tion. He doesn't anticipate having a
problem though because he antici-
pates a favorable Supreme Court
decision.

“If that’s the ruling,” Muller said
of the Solomon Amendments’ being
upheld, “and there’s a good chance
that won’t be the case, we’ll live with
it; keep working and find alternative
sources of money. We’re going to tell
people to make up their own minds.
We won’t take it as a defeat. It will
make us keep working. Some people
won’t go to school. They’ll have to
give up their educations."

For now, all sides must wait.

The formation of a baseball league and the insti-
tution of a 45-second clock for the entirety of each
men’s basketball game were among the measures
approved at the annual Big East Conference meet-
ings last week at Providence, R.l.

The Big East baseball conference will comprise
two divisions of four teams. Pitt, Georgetown,
Seton Hall and Villanova make up the southern
division; Connecticut, Providence, St. John’s and
Boston College are the northern division. Syracuse
has no baseball program. ‘

The two division champions will meet to deter-
mine an overall champion, who could proceed to the
NCAA tournament.

“We have to apply to the NCAA to get a tourna-
ment bid for the winner,” said Big East director of
communications Thomas McElroy. “We may have
to go through a waiting period before they decide,
but when we applied for the women’s basketball and
volleyball leagues, we didn’t have to wait.

“There are some very credible baseball programs
in the conference. In fact, five teams from the Big
East qualified in the ECAC [East Coast Athletic
Conference tournament]. And Seton Hall missed
advancing to the college world series this year by
one game.”

Pitt coach Bobby Lewis was ecstatic about the
decision, the result of which he did not know until
informed by a reporter.

“I didn’t know until right now,” said Lewis. ‘‘I had
tried to talk to Dr. Bozik, but he was in meetings all
morning.

“It’s going to help us recruit. It’s definitely a qual-

’ ity league. Anything that the Big East gets into, they

go all the way —- not just Big East basketball.”
The baseball schedule will feature eighteen con-
ference games. Lewis assured that meetings with

woy - not just Big East bosketboil.”

rivals like Penn State and WestVirginia will con-
tinue but must be scheduled aroundthe conference
season, which willbegin the last weekend of March.

“With the conference games on the weekend, we’ll
play our games with local teams during the week,”
Lewis said.

Conference games will be played in three—game
weekend series, meaning that Pitt will play an.oppo-
nent on Friday, Saturday and Sunday of the same

A weekend. -

The Panthers, who were rained out 22 times last
season, will use Mondays as rain dates. _

The decision to install a 45-second clock for the
duration of each men’s basketball game — the clock
ran for all but the last four minutes of each game in

1983 —-— could result in a faster brand of basketball,

according to Pitt Coach Roy Chipman. pp

“The difference is going to be that you’re going to
have to play basketball for the whole 40 minutes,”
Chipman said. i ‘

“You won’t see the teams going into their stalls. It
will be a lot better for the teams that are behind. You
won’t see the chasing and fouling that are common
at the end of a game. .

“It’s going to be_ a lot more exciting for the fans.”

It will be exciting for even more fans this season as
the Big East’s television package winds off its second
season. It was announced that Metrosports will
offer conference games on Mondays and Saturdays,
ESPN on Tuesdays and USA on Wednesdays.

NBC and CBS will present six conference and
seven inter-conference games during the season.

“Pitt definitely has one and possibly two intercon-
ference games with the networks,” said McElroy.

The nine athletic directors in attendance showed
no interest, in dividing the $6 million package any
further. The topic of expansion was put downjust as
quickly as it was brought up.

Two Panthers in running
for NCAA championship

By Charlie O'Hara
Senior Editor

Panthers Garland Brown and
Darryl Shepherd will face the tallest
challenge of their individual track
careers today and tomorrow at the
NCAA track and field champion-
ships at Eugene, Ore.

“To advance to the finals, they
will have to run the finest races of
their careers,” Pitt coach John Vas-
vary said. “A lot of these guys have
faster times coming in, but as Roger
Kingdom proved last year when he
won the national title, that doesn't
always matter.”

Today at 5:10 p.m., Brown will
face as fine a corps of 800-meter men
as can be assembled in collegiate
track. Host team Oregon boasts the
top candidate in defending cham-
pion sophomore Joaquin Cruz.
Cruz enters the meet with the fastest
qualifying time in the 800-meter run
(1:45. 12) in addition to the top rank-
ing at the I500-meter distance.

Brown’s time of l:47.7 ranks him
among the top 12 in the country and
No. 2 in Pitt history behind 1954
NCAA champion and Olympic

,bronze medalist Arnie Sowell

(l:47.6).

Aside from Cruz, Brown has com-
peted with and defeated several of
the other qualifiers whose times are
better. "

_At the Big East indoor champion-
ships, he defeated former NCAA
champion John Marshall of Villan-
ova (l:46.45) and was named the
oustanding track performer at the
meet. When he ran his outdoor qual-
ifying team of l:47.7 at the Cavalier
Classic at Virginia, he nipped Ray
Brown of Virginia (l:47.5).

“A lot of the faster times have to
do with the weather conditions,”

Vasvary said. “We’re all competing
under the same conditions, so you
can basically throw out the past
performances.“

Shepherd will most certainly not
want to throw out the past perfor-
mances, as his l3.5 in the 110-meter
hurdles two weeks ago at the Pitt
Invitational earned him much recog-
nition in NCAA track.

Only two of his ll NCAA com-

petitors —— Cletus Clark of Houston
(13.41) and John Timpson of Texas
Southern (13.48) ~— have done bet-
ter during the 1984 outdoor season.

Shepherd has only faced one of
his challengers, Eugene Norman, in
prior meets. They went head to head
at the Intercollegiate Amateur Alt-
hletic Association of America meet,
but Norman, who has run the hur-
dles in 13.74, fell and was
disquatified.

Local scorer
chooses Pitt
by tradition

Laurie Kubll
Staff Writer

It's in her blood. Fox Chapel
graduate Sally Sheerer will be
attending Pitt this autumn, as did
her parents before her. However,
neither her mother, who studied
sociology, nor her father, a lawyer
who earned his undergraduate
degree in engineering, did what Sally
will be doing.

Sheerer is a 6-foot forward who
recently signed with Pitt's women's
basketball team —- a talented squad
that finished the I983-84 regular sea-
son 6-2 in first place in the Big East
conference before losing in the
second round of the playoffs.

“We have a lot of depth at forward
with Jennifer Bruce and Julie Cal-
lan,” head coach Judy Saurer
commented.

Bruce, who will be a senior, led the
conference in scoring with 24.3
.points per game and also pulled
down 9.7 rebounds per game. Cal-
Ian, as a freshman, added 10.4 points
and 5.9 rebounds. According to
Saurer, Sheerer will not see much
action in the upcoming season, but
“she has made a commitment that
she wants to be a part of the team.”

In her senior year at Fox Chapel
when she was named first team all-
WPIAL (Quad-A), Sheerer grabbed
13 rebounds, scored 16.5 points and
had four assists per game. She also
was honored as first-team all section
and was named among The Pitts-
burgh Press’ North Top Ten Play-
ers, making both teams as a junior
and as a senior.

Sheerer was a member of Pitts-
burgh’s Ozanam team, which won
the 1983 championship game at the
Stockholm Basket Cup in Sweden.

This home-grown athlete dis-
played versatility by letteringtwice
in softball and once in vollyeball, in
addition to earning three letters in
basketball. .

Sheerer had considered attending
Purdue, Fordham (New York City)
and conference rival Seton Hall, but
she chose Pitt for its proximity. “I
like the program and the coach, and
it’s close to home.” ‘

She said she has been to Oakland
often, attending football games and
events held in William Pitt Union.
For the most part, though, she came
to watch her future teammates play,
and she liked what she saw.

Highlights
available

“Dare to Dream,” a 41-minute
1983 Pitt football highlight film, is
now available for public viewing.

The film focuses on Fazio, who
finished his second season as head
coach with as many victories (17) as
any second-year coach in Pitt foot-
ball history, and Bill Fralic, the two-
time All-America offensive tackle. It
shows Pitt’s best face -—— from its
facilities, to its people and its
nationally-recognized football pro-
gram —- and it points up the special
relationship the school has with its
doorstep community in Oakland.

It begins with victory at Notre
Dame, the highlight of the season

for Fazio and his football team,
backs up to the thrilling last-second
victory over Syracuse in which a
young man previously unknown to
some members of the team, and cer-
tainly Pitt fans at large, Pat Vian-
court, came through with a
game-winning field goal.

Then it traces the season from its
start with a wild win at Tennessee to
its ﬁnish at the Fiesta Bowl, where
the Panthers suffered a heartbreak-
ing defeat to the Buckeyes of Ohio
State in a sensational high-scoring
contest.

It can be obtained for showings to
school and community service
groups, banquet gatherings and Inn-
cheons by contacting Audio Visual
Aids (624-4464 at Hillman Library
or by contacting the sports informa-

» tion department (624-4588).
