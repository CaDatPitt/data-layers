Pittsburgh: A city submerged

Parkway, stadium
among victims of

the flood at '96  

By Mark Gordon
Editor in Chief

Cars turned into submarines; street signs
became helpless drowning victims; and ice-
bergs ﬂoated down Pittsburgh’s three rivers as
warm weather and rain forced the Blizzard of
‘96 into the Flood of "96. .

Bridges were closed as well as- parts of
Parkway 369, both east and west, early
Saturday as the city’s three rivers —- the
Monongahela, the Ohio and the Allegheny —
met at Point State Park and crested at just
under 35 feet, causing the fountain to be sub-
merged.

Pittsburgh Mayor Tom Murphy and Larry
Dunn, the newly elected chairman of the
Allegheny County Board of Commissioners,
both declared a state of emergency for the
area. '

Many city residents were evacuated from

their homes, including those living in a com-
munity in Squirrel Hill, and the rising rivers
took over some streets near Point Park. Three
Rivers Stadium was also affected by the rag-
ing waters; the parking lots turned into ponds.

One major problem caused by the ﬂooding
was the forced shutdown of the Allegheny
County Sanitary Authority. The sewage ‘treat-
ment plant serves over 100 communities in the
city, and, although the sewers were operating,
the sewage was not being treated. As a result,
raw sewage was dumped into the rivers.

According to the National Weather Service
and the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, the river’s
cresting point of 34.9 feet was the third high-
est in Pittsburgh’s history.

The St. Patrick’s Day Flood in 1936 rose to
46 feet, the highest ever, followed by the
Hurricane Agnes Flood in 1972, which crested
at 35.8 feet. .

As of late Saturday, local officials said it
was too early to come up with an estimate of
total damage, but it is likely to be over $10
million. ,

That already compounds the city’s tight bud-
get, which, with still two monthsleft in winter,
is already at its peak. Mayor Murphy told
WPXI television in an interview on Saturday
that he might ask the state for financial help.

Dancing

for charity-

By Jim Rowe
Staff Writer '

The last thing that anyone
wants to do after dancing for
24 hours is to take a road trip.
Unless that trip is in a brand
new car that happens to have
just been given to that per-
son, free of charge.

As part of their promotion-
al activities for the ‘second
annual University of
Pittsburgh-Family House
Dance Marathon, the organiz-
ers will be doing just that.
Every participant who com-
pletes this year’s marathon
will receive a key. One of the
keys will open the door to a
brand new 1996 Geo Tracker.

“Someone will walk away
with that car. "We will hand
over the keys that night,” said
Maureen Anderson of Family
House.

Organizers are hoping that

this year’s event will be big- .

ger and better than last
year’s. That, however, is a
tough goal to beat. The 1995
Dance "Marathon had 225
dancers and" over 200 volun-
teers, and it raised in excess
of $57,000, all for a charita-
ble organization.

“The marathon is 24 hours

V of food, fun and dancing."

Anderson said.
“Unfortunately, it still has the
label of a Greek-only event.“

As it was last year. the
1996 Dance Marathon is
open to all students. faculty
and staff of the University of
Pittsburgh. To dance. partici-
pants need to raise a mini-
mum of $150.

“There are many ways to
raise the money.“ Anderson
said. adding that .the

Plan early for thisspring's fun in the sun

By Jim Rowe
Staff Writer

If you’re planning on going to a warm ‘destination this spring
break but haven’t made your reservations yet, you might be out
of luck. . . ' ‘ - _~

The airlines are nearly booked, and hotel roomsare becom-
ing scarce everywhere from Panama City to Key West and
South Padre Island, Texas, said Carrie Lynn Good,_ a travel con-
sultant and veteran spring break agent with University Travel
Service.

Citing better prices than last year, Good recommends that
students who haven’t made plans yet should do it now.

“Do not wait, because reservations are going quickly. If
[reservations] haven’t been made, students should see their
agents soon.” Good said.

Pitt’s spring break coincides with those of other schools, as
well as with the busy tourist and convention season that brings
thousands of people daily to warm destinations. According to

Good, the combination of spring break and Biker Week has

already made hotel rooms anywhere near Daytona. Fla.. next to

impossible to find.

In addition,Good also said that the longer students wait. the
more expensive the trip will become. '

“I’d advise students to [book reservations] as soon as possi-
ble, and they should expect prices to go up the longer they
wait. It’s critical that they absolutely book soon. because [for
spring break] there’s no such thing as a last-minute booking.”-_
Good said. 8

But fear not, sun lovers. If you act quickly, you may still be
able to spend this spring break lying on a warm beach instead
of staying at home shoveling the sidewalks.

“Cancun is still the hottest destination this year.” Good said.
Panama City, Jamaica, South Padre Island and Puerto Vallarta
are also very popular this year. .

“South Padre Island is limited. because only Continental
Airlines flies there from Pittsburgh. And Puerto Vallarta is not

Win CI car, raise
money for charity

By Nicole Walz
Staff Writer

Music provided by The X 106.7 FM, food and prizes
will all be at Eddie’s on Wednesday night at 8 p.m. for
the kickoff party of the Family House/University of
Pittsburgh Dance Marathon.

At the kickoff party, anyone from the Pitt community
can register for the marathon or sign up to be on various
committees, such as security. physical plant, entertain-
ment or food. Registration will continue until March 1.

“We already have lots of organizations involved — the
Nursing School, Black Action Society, Blue and Gold
Society, etc., but we want everyone to be involved,” said
Maureen Anderson. the Special Events Coordinator for
Family House. Organizations that enter 20 or more
dancers can win a color television.

The dance marathon will be held on March 22 and 23 at
the Fitzgerald Field House. The event is 24 hours long
with various local bands and theme hours. Last year,
Brownie Mary and The Dharma Sons were two of the
bands that played.

Each dancer is expected to raise at least $150 by can-
ning or donations from family and friends. In return,
there will be chances to win prizes like a person’s height
in CD3, donated by The X 106.7 FM, or a Geo Tracker,
donated by Baierl Chevrolet. Prizes will increase with
the level of money raised. Other dance marathon sponsors
are Giant Eagle, Wendy’s, PNC Bank, Mellon Bank,
Heinz and Cameron Coca-Cola.

This year’s dance marathon is different because Family
House is looking for dancers not only from the student
body, but from the whole campus as well. 1

“We want anyone who is interested ——- doctors, faculty,
secretaries,” said Andersen. “There’s really more of an
emphasis on a campus—wide event.”

Opinions
Courts forget the kids

Over the past few years, the courts have proved again and
again that children have no legal rights. In fact, not only do
children not have rights, their best interests are not even an
issue when presented to the courts. Far more important issues
have to be dealt with when deciding custody battles, such as
race relations and gender bias.

You might think that race and gender wouldn’t play a very
important role when put up against something as important
as the welfare of a child. You might also think that children
might have some kind of input when the rest of their lives
hang in the balance. You might also think that adults would
act slightly more mature than the children in question when
deciding to fight for custody. Unfortunately, none of these
notions are true.

Recent court battles over child custody have proved this
time and again. Children who have been in the loving care of
adopted parents for years are being torn from their homes
because their biological “father” (i.e. the man who donated
the sperm to get the biological mother pregnant so the child
could be put up for adoption) decided he wanted “his” child.
Biological “mothers” who put their children up for adoption
at birth decide they made a mistake, and then claim they
were not advised of all their options. Then they get custody
back. Abusive or neglectful parents are re-awarded custody
once they go through a class and become magically “rehabil—
itated.”

Pittsburgh’s Baby Byron case from last summer made
national headlines, and it is an excellent example of the
injustice being done to children. Foster parents of Baby
Byron and his sister were fighting to be able to adopt the two
children, but the biological grandmother wanted temporary
custody until the children’s mother finished drug rehabilita-
tion. On the same day of the hearing, the children’s mother
was being arraigned on prostitution charges. .

But many people argued that the children would be better
off if they were raised by members of their own race (they
couldn’t be raised right by the white family who had cared
for them until now). Apparently, the judge in the case agreed,
and re-awarded custody of the two children to a mother who.
has a history of repeated drug abuse and prostitution. But
they will be better off with a black, drug-addicted mother
than a white mother and father who took care of them for
years. That makes perfect sense, doesn’t it?

The children’s physical welfare in this and so many other
cases is not the only thing being ignored. Their mental well-
being is being trampled on as the adults in their lives fight to
see who gets to keep them. Children in custody battles are
being treated more like chattel than human beings. The chil-
dren are deprived of any sense of stability, which is so vital
in the formative years of childhood. ‘

Children’s rights should not be ignored in order. to serve
some political agenda. Biological parents should have certain
rights, yes. But providing a sound and stable environment for
the child should be more important than any question of race
or gender bias.

Media bias belongs in tabloids

The Phoenix. The Tribune-
Review. The  Pitt News?
Yes, the editorial board of
our beloved campus newspa-
per appears to have thrown in
its lot with the unrestrained
conservatism of our other
local right-leaning publica-
tions-. On Thursday, Jan. 11,
the editorial column cited
“the overwhelming bias of
the liberal media” as the rea-
son we haven’t been able to
enjoy daily updates on the
Whitewater investigation.

How many times must we
be subjected to the whining
of conservatives who claim
to be the target of a mass-
media vendetta? It seems
inescapable. Whether avoid-
ing issues in class, writing an
editorial or pontificating on
the radio, somewhere there is
a self-righteous conservative
claiming to have been vic-
timized. How curious that
this comes from a group
which blames most of soci-
ety’s problems on an ever-
expanding culture of victim-
hood.

‘What is any institution of

—the media if not an entity

within our free—market econ-
omy? A journalistic enter-
prise is a business like any
other. As such, it must stay
on thepositive side of the
balance sheet, something
done by selling a product —
news. Thus, that which is
newsworthy makes its way
into our mass media.

‘ Newspapers and syndicates
are owned by corporations,
which have never been
accused of harboring coveys

»of conspiring liberals. Mass

media organizations, as sell-
ers of a product, must cater
to the demands of buyers in
order to remain solvent. In
this case, those buyers are
the public. If the media is
libe'ral, this would imply
(according to basic laws of
supply and demand) that the
' as’ "well.

Greg
Marchand

Conservatives who would
dispute this claim are contra-
dicting their free—market con-
victions.

Perhaps Whitewater will
prove to be a serious affair,
showing improper or illegal
conduct on the part of our
president. However, up to
now there have been no dra-
matic revelations of guilt,
nothing more than vague
accusations of ‘little interest
to anyone but the most
intensely partisan.
Conspiracy theories about
the suicide of Vincent Foster
have made their way to the
cover of the Tribune-Review
but are probably better suited
to the Weekly W0rld.News.

Simply put, there is little _

about Whitewater that has
been found newsworthy, cer-
tainly nothing on the level of
Watergate. '

By fanatically pursuing the
situation past the boundaries
of minor things like facts and
proof, conservatives appear
overly intent on the exploita-
tion of the situation for polit-
ical profit. Again, this is not
to say that there might not
have been wrongdoing on the
part of the first family. What
is important, however, is that
we have something in this
country known as due
process, which should guar-

xantee the rights of the
accused as well as the

accuser. _

Whitewater is not yet a
scandal. It is a continuing
investigation which should
not be constrained or direct-
ed by the erratic hands of
public hysteria. Should we
castigate the media for refus-
ing to commit too soon to
what is still, in large part,
only an extension of political
mudslinging? If you are cori-
servative, with a vested inter-
est in seeing President

Clinton removed from office
at any cost, the answer is
yes.

Beyond Whitewater, the
implication that the media
has somehow attempted to

coddle President Clinton is '

ridiculous. A quick check of
statistics shows that newspa-
per references of Clinton
throughout his term have
been more consistently nega-
tive than those of any other
president in modern history.
Nobody has claimed that the
“conservative media” is to
blame.

In fact, news journalists
have become increasingly
acidic and vicious towards
politicians as a whole. In
doing so, they cater to the
sensationalist in all of us in
order to sell more of their

product. This,.more than any ‘
_,bias, is a disturbing trend.

To some extent, skepticism
towards our government is
warranted. Clinton has com-
mitted his share of misdeeds,
and there have been enough
scandals within Congress to
keep investigative journalists
satiated for years. However,
the trend can be dangerous,
particularly when it brings
hatred rather than a healthy
cynicism. Theigrowth of
anti-government groups "such
as militias is a symptom of
this political malice, "as is the
zeal of conservatives who
have repeatedly placed the
cart before the horse in cases
like Whitewater.

I find the descent of The_

Pitt News editorial board into
self-righteous conservatism
disappointing. The liberal
media exists to some extent,
as does the conservative
media and the moderate
media. The notion that mass
media as a whole harbors an
“overwhelming bias” is a
conspiracy theory fit only for
the tabloids. _

§I‘he politics of Powell in the p

It’s truly a shame that Colin
Powell decided against running
for president. Not only was he
qualified to be a fine presiden-
tial candidate, but he was per-
fectly suited to be an outstand-
ing president. He was indeci-
sive, noncommittal, ambiguous,
inexperienced, manipulative and
a publicity hound. It’s no won-
der that both parties actively
recruited Powell to be their stan-
dard bearer in the presidential
election.

Powell’s recent book tour
allowed for the intellectual mas-
turbation from journalists and
politicians, to different classes,
races and political affiliations of
ordinary Americans.
Speculation was rampant that
the four-star general would toss
his “I beat Iraq” baseball cap
into the presidential primary cir-
cus. Of course, a run at the pres-
idency was never in Powell’s
mind. No one with a political
affiliation as. ambiguous as a
unisex haircut makes it in
today’s political world.
Anything less than a full bap-
tism to a party’s platform is seen
as treachery and a sign of weak-
ness.

Powell knew it would have
been foolish to run. His distin-
guished life and military career
would have been reduced and
altered to fodder for tabloid
journalism and political rivals.
Powell’s book tour was, from
the beginning, no more and no
less than a classically orchestrat-

Support for Jamal is support

On Dec. 9, 1981, Philadelphia
Police Officer David Faulkner
stopped a motor vehicle driven
by two men. Officer Faulkner
ended up beating William Cook
with -a flashlight. William
Cook’s brother, Addison Cook
(a taxicab driver), saw the situa-

' tion and approached the scene.

Addison Cook has since
changed his name and is now
known as Mumia Abu-Jamal.
The events are as follows,
according to the prosecution: Mr.
Jamal attacked Ofﬁcer Faulkner,
then proceeded to stand over
him and shoot him two times,
“Woooo, thats some shit. ”

Mr. Jamal was brought to trial
in Philadelphia in 1982. In the

‘trial Mr.,Jamal was denied self-

representation; he received an

r attorney who was thrust into the

/

role of trial attorney without
preparation and was denied "an
assistant to his counsel. He was
judged by a jury pool which was
not randomly selected (violation
of state and federal law), and
certain jurors conducted prema-
ture deliberations (violation of
due process). During the trial,
four witnesses testiﬁed that Mr.
Jamal was shot by Officer
Faulkner upon approaching the
scene.

Oh, the judge in this trial,
Judge Sabo, considered by many
to be the “hang judge” (former
police sheriﬁ‘, member of the fra-
ternal order of police), sentenced
more people to death row than
any other judge in the U.S. He

ed publicity stunt to sell more
books than he would have origi-
nally sold without the political
speculation. Yes, Colin Powell,
being the manipulator that he is,
would fit beautifully within the
American political spectrum.

The Republicans loved the
idea of Powell as their presiden-
tial nominee. For a party ﬁlled
with Doles and Gingriches — as
well as the overly eager, bully-
like, freshmen congressmen
thugs —— Powell’s face was a
friendly one in a party com-
prised of bitter, sour, stiff,
spoiled, rich, white, homopho-
bic religious fanatics.

Powell offered the party a
black man who is not dark-
skinned enough to alienate the
Klansmen, skinheads and white
supremacists that make up the
right wing of the party as repre-
sented by David Duke. His lib-
eral social views, while not pop-
ular within party ranks, would
draw in moderate Democrats in
a national election. While Pat
Buchanan and Ralph Reed, the
pimps of the Republican party,
might dislike Powell’s liberal
slant on the conservative agen-
da, they can’t argue that his
impeccable military record
would soothe the hawkish
Republican whims.
Furthermore, Powell’s military
record makes Clinton’s “mili-
tary” experience (he dated
Sharmon Faulkner once), pale in
comparison. Of course, com-
pared to Clinton, even Dan

was quoted by the Philadelphia
Inquirer as saying, “I never met
a defendant who was not guilty,”
and labeled as a “prosecutor’s
dream.” The jury in his trial
asked the judge to provide
instructions for manslaughter,
and they received ones for mur-
der in the first. What! Who in
Pennsylvania gets the death
penalty? Well, sad to say that in
the U.S. 40 percent of those con-
victed of first-degree murder and
given the death penalty are
black. In Pennsylvania that num-
ber is 60 percent. Why so many?
Hmmm, society?

During the trial, Mr. Jamal
was said to have been found
with his .38 caliber gun, the
same gun that killed Officer

‘Faulkner. But in the coroner’s

report it is stated that the bullet
pulled from Officer Faulkner’s
body belongs to a .44 caliber
gun. There were no tests done on
the gun, not even .a smell test to
see if it had been recently ﬁred.
That really £21.’! logical.

Also, for the record, one pros-
ecution witness had three pend-
ing felony charges at the time of
testifying. After the trial, no
charges were brought against the
witness, and the witness contin-
ued to work the streets as a pros-
titute under the protection of two
undercover Philadelphia police
officers. Another key prosecu-
tion witness, a convicted arson-
ist, gave testimony at the trial
that was opposite his initial
report tothe police. The prosecu-

Gallahou

Quayle, whose military experi-
ence consists of crowd control
in an empty Indiana field, is a
military veteran.

The Democrats, meanwhile,
would love Powell, simply
because he’s not Clinton. He’s a
military hero — hell, at least
he’s been in the military. His
liberal stance on abortion and
affirmative action would fit per-
fectly into the party platform.
Furthermore, his conservative
slant on foreign policy would
balance all the liberal hippy
freaks who want to surrender
the United States to a group of
vegetarian Eskimos living on
the Alaskan tundra, who have
unrealistic dreams of living in
an oil-free world inhabited by
poets and painters and governed

. by a Communist government

consisting of spotted owls and
Greenpeace activists.

Powell’s real-life foreign poli-
cy experience, be it as a soldier,
as head of the Joint Chiefs or as
private citizen, skillfully pro-

Jab

Woo son

tion stated that Jamal gave a ver-

bal confession in the hospital the A

night of the murder. Mr. Jamal’s
witness, Off1cervWakshul, stated
in his report that “the negro male
made no statements.” Note that
Officer Wakshul was on vaca-
tion at the time of the trial. A
doctor from the hospital says
that Mr. Jamal was beaten up so
badly that he was not in any con-
dition to utter a confession.
Smells ﬁshy to me.

If murder one means either
that the murder was premeditat-
ed or happened in the act of a
felony, then why was murder one
sought, when Mr: Jamal coinci-
dentally arrived on the scene? I
don ’t see that as premeditated.

I don’t have an answer for that
one. Mr. Jamal is trying for a
second trial. I don’t know -— if
you were involved in this alleged
set-up, who would you get to
determine whether or not Mr.
Jamal should have a new trial?
Hmmm, I got it! How about the
same judge =from last time. Oh,
what a coinky-dink: Judge Sabo
is that same judge. ..

You say, tell me about the
Philadelphia police department. I
say, just recently 1400 cases
were thrown out the window,
prisoners let go, nine police offi-
cers suspended indefinitely.
Why? Because the nice and
well-respected police officers
havebeen convicted of set ups,

ducing a diplomatic solution to
the Haitian dilemma, would add
a much needed sense of realism
to the perpetually starry-eyed,
idealistic Democrats.

However, Powell’s deft, con-
servative foreign policy skill,
while much appreciated, might
not be as welcome as Powell’s
conservative policy behind bed-
room doors. Powell’s fidelity,
while wholly against the prereq-
uisite for joining the Democratic

, ranks, would be a novel concept

for a party known more for
Gennifer Flowers, Donna Rice
and Beverly Heard, than for the
politicians they slept with.
Perhaps Powell’s greatest
attribute is his lack of
Washington political experi-
ence. Lack of experience is the
latest fad that appeals to
Americans and therefore to their
politicians. Inexperience is no
longer considered a detriment to
an aspiring politician. Instead,
the word is repackaged as “out-
sider” and tagged graciously on
the suit jackets of new politi-
cians. Powell’s suit jacket is
brimming with the word “out-
sider,” from the Republicans,
Democrats and Perot’s
Independent Party. Ironically,
Powell worked in Washington
with the last three presidents,
but no one needs to know that.
Besides, experience isn’t needed
in order to be president. All
that’s needed is good oratory
skill, good hair and a lot of
money.- Powell’s good hair,

for black

hiding evidence, cover ups,
changing evidence and produc-
ing evidence that just was not
supposed to be there.

I know that these innocent vic-
tims were Philadelphia resi-
dents, but to which ethnic groups
do they all belong? Hmmm,
Black and Hispanic. What ethnic
group does Mr. Jamal belong to?
I know," Black. How come I
never heard of this? Why is so
little said about this case?

Hmmm, I know, because this
is such a controversial case that
the media and the Philadelphia
police department are covering it
up. Who else knows about this,
and what are they doing about
it? Many people (though not
enough) are appealing this case:
Government leaders in France,
Germany, ‘Japan, South Africa
and Canada (just to name a few)
are appealing to the U.S. to stop
Mr. Jamal’s execution.

I know a little about this. I see
that the Philadelphia police
department is not the most pure
and innocent in the country. I
know that Judge Sabo is a little
biased but why did they do this
to Mr: Jamal?

Mr. Jamal has been under sur-
veillance by the FBI and the
Philadelphia police department
since the age of 15. Mr. Jamal
was a locally known journalist
and radio show host who made it
his duty as a member of the
press to point out the cover-ups,
the brutality, etc. of the
Philadelphia police department.

residential race

inexperience in working with
lawmakers and money made
from the book tour made him
the most appealing free agent in
years. But he decided against
running.

So Dole and Clinton are
breathing a sigh of relief.
Gingrich can now armounce that
he’ll run for president, even
though he’s just a representative
who barely got re-elected in a
small district in Georgia.
Buchanan can breathe easier
knowing that during debates he

won’t have to share the stage ,

with two black men. All the
candidates — Democrats,
Republicans and Independents
— are all happier now that
Powell isn’t running.

Regular citizens, while disap-
pointed, should be happier as

well. If Powell were elected, it .

would prove that the national
elections are little more than a
popularity contest, much like
Miss America and Student
Government Board elections. It
would show the world that we
are a democracy of idiots, blind-
ly following the brightest light.
In the meantime, however, we
can continue to live in our rose-
colored world and look out our
windows on election day and be
proud that one fifth of all
Americans eligible to vote are
going to the polls to elect the
best man for the job.

leaders

Now I know. I want to get
involved. What can I do? I ’m
tired of just letting things in soci-
ety pass me by without voicing
my opinions. Sometimes I feel
like I do nothing around here.
Well, look out for the forum
comingup in January on Mr.
Jarnal’s plea for justice. Hmmm,
justice is not a word; you should
use just yet. .

Black people, if you believe
that this is not our biggest strug-
gle for justice of the ‘90s, you
are deeply misled. Mr. Jamal is a
man who sacrificed advance-
ment in his career, underwent
pressures and stuck his head out
for us by reporting on the police
brutality and the injustices of the
late ‘70s. If we don’t stand by
him, in front of him and behind
him, then we will come to a
point when our leaders will not
feel free to stick there heads out
for us because we carmot even
stand behind people who stand

for us. It is a shame if you take 

more interest in a black man
who rushed for 2,000 yards in

one season and won the 1
Heisman trophy and was a drunk

driver rather than a man who
could have been one of this cen-
tury’s African-American leaders.

Please, I beg you, show the
support. that we saw for the
release of Nelson Mandela and
help get Mr. Jamal only what is
promised to us — and that is due
justice.

Panthers fall 66-57

at Miami for second
consecutive defeat

By Mike Kovak
Asst. Sports Editor

ost people look at
being 31 gracious
host as one of the

staples of etiquette and couth
in today’s society. Always
treat your guests with the
utmost respect and be sure to
go out of your way to make .
their visit perfect. Clean that
tub with a little more elbow
grease and make it shine;
whip up that favorite dish of
theirs and be sure to put out
the good china. Maybe even
pick up some good coffee
table literature for a chic
conversation piece. Also, be
sure to take down that gaudy
Terrible Towel from the
mantle and don’t dare yell
out, “You think our Stillers
are gunna whoop up on them
there Cowboys n’at?” That
wouldn’t be good.

You know, go the extra
mile to impress your guests,
and you’ll be right up there
with the best of them.

The same does not apply
when it comes to the world
of college basketball. When
another team comes into
your house, they best expect
to walk away with a loss.
Winning at home is a must
— it’s one thing that all
great teams do. That is what
makes them great teams,
along with winning a good
share of games on the road,
too. Pitt has not come that
far yet, but the Panthers do
know how to win at home.

As Dick Vitale said last
week, Fitzgerald Field
House is one of the toughest
places to play in the country.
Vitale then went out on a

‘limb and said that when No.

1 UMass invades the Field
House Tuesday that they
would leave with their first
loss.

That may be a little prema-
ture. I mean, Pitt has never
faced a No. 1 team at
Fitzgerald. The closest it has
come was in ‘93 when Dean
Smith’s top—ranked Tarheels
pulled away from the
Panthers in the second half,
but that game was over break
at the echoing Civic Arena.

Tuesday will be different.

°Column, page P7

The Pitt Panther basketball

team started with blazing guns
and ended with a furious ﬂurry,
but the Miami Hurricanes
maintained cruise control en
route to a 66-57 victory at
Miami Arena Saturday night.
_ Only three minutes into the
game, Pitt forward Chad Varga
grabbed a Panther miss and
scored on a easy layup. The
hoop gave Pitt an early 9-1
lead. The game appeared to be
in the Panthers’ hands.

Miami grabbed the game
right from the Panthers minutes
later.

Miami finally got its act
together when sleek sophomore
point guard Kevin Norris found
freshman acrobat Tim James
open for a thunderous alley-
oop, which narrowed Pitt’s lead
to 12-7 with less than 13 min-
utes left in the first half.

After James’ dazzling dunk,
Miami shooting guard Stephen
Edwards took over. Edwards,
who had a game-high 21
points, scored eight points,
including two 3-pointers, in
less than three minutes to give
the Hurricanes their first lead at

19-17. Pitt would never reclaim
the lead.

Pitt Head Coach Ralph
Willard said, “We knew that
Edwards is a good player, and
we said that we were going to
take away his 3-point shooting.
What did we do? Let him go
four-for-eight from 3-point
land.”

Pitt’s shooting turned dismal
as the Hurricanes, behind
Edwards’ 15 first-half points,
opened up a a 13-point lead
after James rebounded a
Hurricane miss for two with
just :28 left in the half.

As time ran out in the half,
Panther point guard Jerry
McCullough finally entered his
name in the scoring column
with a little running jumper that
put Miami’s halftime lead at
35-24.

“We’re not doing anything
with any poise right now,”
Vlfillard said.

Miami went on a 26-9 run
during the last 10 minutes
while shooting 13-for-28 (46
percent) from the field. Pitt
shot nine-for-24 (38 percent)
from the ﬁeld. The Hurricanes
also out muscled the Panthers
19-13 on the boards during the
first half. Shooting guard

 
  

Guard Andre Alridge looks to drive.

Garrick Thomas led the
Panthers with eight points at
the half.

Willard said, “We’re not
doing the mental things that we
need to do, that we practice all
week, to go out and win.”

The second half began the
way the first half finished.
Norris opened up the scoring
with a 3-pointer to give Miami
a 14-point, 38-24, lead.

Lady Panthers clown BC, 72-69

By Brad Isles
Sports Editor

The dust from an 11-game losing streak has
apparently settled comfortably under the feet
of the Lady Panther basketball team, as it
picked up its second consecutive win with a
72-69 victory over Boston College Saturday.

The win pushed Pitt’s record to 3-14 overall
and 2-6 in the Big East. Boston College drops
to 7-9 overall and 4-4 in the conference.

“We’re turning it around, but we’re not there
yet,” said Pitt Head Coach Kirk Bruce. “This
is a decent game for us.

“We think teams figure we’re in last place
and that’s going to be a win for them. We have
an edge-now because teams are taking us light-
1y. Well, we’re going out there to win the
game, not just hang around.”

Despite coming out in the first half playing
inspired defense, the Lady Panthers fell behind
6-2 early in the game. Boston College looked
to star forward Holly Porter underneath, and
she delivered with ‘two layups and two foul
shots after being fouled by Latia Howard.

Pitt switched between different zone and
man-to-man presses and defenses in the first
half, hoping to control Porter. This didn’t
work, as Porter scored 13 of BC’s 23 points in
the half. ’

What did work, however, was the Lady
Panthers’ other game plan -- take the ball at

Porter offensively and get her into foul trou- .

ble.

She picked up her second foul at the 3:52
mark of the first, after Julie Fomadel hit guard
JoJo Guzman for a breakaway layup, which
Guzman followed with a 3-pointer from the

left wing to give Pitt a 20-16 lead.

The Lady Eagles recaptured the lead with 50
seconds left in the half, after a pass from
Cecilee Campbell took a gratuitous bounce off
the backboard and fell into Porter’s hands
under the hoop. Porter made the layup, giving
BC a 23-22 edge.

Howard countered for Pitt with a layup of
her own at :27. Boston College’s Toya Squair
travelled, giving the Lady Panthers the final
shot of the half.

With two seconds left, freshman forward
Gina Montesano hit a 3-pointer from the left
wing, giving Pitt a 27-23 advantage and
momentum going into halftime.

“My concern was not letting them get a shot
because we had the lead,” Bruce said. “We had
a play and wanted something special, but Gina
fires a three off one dribble. She wants to go
out there and do whatever she has to do.”

“She’s developing into one of the best fresh-
men we ever had and one of the best freshmen
in this league already, and we aren’t done yet.
She’s just a tough young lady.”

Montesano finished the game with 20 points.

Pitt came out in thesecond half playing vir-
tually all man-to-man defense and held BC
scoreless for nearly four minutes. In the same
span, the Lady Panthers broke out to a 12-
point lead on six straight points by Howard, a
Montesano layup and a l2—footer by Stephanie
Petho.

“We did everything we have in our play-
book,” Bruce said. “In the first half we were
changing on the ﬂy. We went almost all man-
to-man in the second. We don’t like to do that,
but it was working.”

‘BC, page P6

After the two teams traded,
buckets for a couple minutes,
James, who finished the game
with 12 points, hit a turnaround
jumper and then had another
monster dunk on a missed shot
to give Miami its largest lead of

the game at 48-30 with 11 min- I

utes remaining.
James’s dunk breathed life

Pitt great,
Green, to

By Sean Duncan
Managing Editor

In the late 1970s. Hugh 1

Green’s name used to volley
back and forthlike a beach ball
in Pitt Stadium’s stands. One
side of the crowd would yell
“Huuugh,” and the other side
would yell “Green.”

Nearly 20 years later. Pitt’s
devastating defensive end’s

Foundation and College Hall of

that Green, along with 10 oth-

Panthers look to upset No. l and rolling Minuln

By Brad Isles
Sports Editor

Is it foolish to think the Pitt—University of
Massachusetts game could be the turning
point of the Panther season?

So far this year. the young Panthers have
been average’. Taking nothing away from the
incredible 75-56 victory over the then-No. 5
Georgetown Hoyas. four of Pitt’s eight wins
have come against Duquesne. Virginia
Commonwealth. Brown and Prairie View. 9

But. after winning five consecutive games
and moving up to No. 31 in national polls,
Pitt. now 8-5 on the year. has dropped its last
two games on the road with a disappointing
78-77 loss to Rutgers and a 66-57 loss to
Miami.

A win over the 16-0 No. 1 Minutemen
would not only stop Pitt’s two—game slide, but
it would also take away the potential of a long
losing streak. After UMass, the Panthers play
No. 6 Connecticut, Providence and Seton
Hall, all in six days.

A win over UMass on national television
also could be a key step for the Panthers in
making it to the NCAA Tournament in March.

“We’re looking forward to it,” said Pitt
Assistant Coach Sean Miller. “It’s onerof a
streak of tough ones for us.”

 
 

The Minutemen received a big lift last
weekend when star center and arguably the
best player in the country, Marcus Camby.
flew into Pittsburgh.

Camby, whom UMass Coach John Calipari
describes as a 7-foot point guard, leads the
Atlantic 10 in scoring at 20.9 points per game.
But he’s missed the last three games after col-
lapsing Jan. 14, 10 minutes before a game
against St. Bonaventure. ‘

He will likely practice today in preparation
for the game.

With Camby out. other Minutemen have
stepped into the spotlight. Senior forward
Donta Bright, averaging nearly 16 points per
game. scored a career-high 32 in Wednesday’s
77-71 win over Rhode Island. Then on
Saturday against Duquesne, junior guard
Carmelo Travieso, averaging 10.3 points per
game scorched the Dukes for 33 points,
including 7-for-8 behind the 3-point arc.

Then there is senior forward Dana Dingle, '

who scored 24 against Duquesne and averages
nearly ll points per game. He’s also good for
eight rebounds per game.

And there is junior Edgar Padilla running
the point, scoring at a 10-point clip and dish-
ing out six assists per game.

Calipari returns to

By Mark Gordon
Editor in Chief

Pittsburgh native John Calipari
woke up in his Los Angeles hotel
room one night in 1987, and
everything around him was shak-
ing.

A Pitt assistant basketball
coach at the time, Calipari had
never experienced an earthquake,
but he was told it was safest to
stand in the doorway during one.

His boss. Pitt Head Coach Paul
Evans ran into the hallway when
the ground started to shake, and
the sight of a trembling Calipari
in his underwear brought him
into hysterics.

“I was never so glad to leave a
place.” quipped Evans as he told
that story to basketball writer
John Feinstein for his book A
Season Inside — One Year in
College Basketball.

Since then, Calipan"s coaching
career has shaken up the college
coaching fraternity, much like an
earthquake.

He has resurrected the

University of Massachusetts
Minutemen, bringing them to the
top of the Atlantic 10 conference.
They have won four straight A-
10 regular season and tourna-
ment championships and have
been to the Sweet 16 and the
Elite Eight in recent seasons.

This year his Minuteman are
No.1 in the country, and tomor-
row night they put their undefeat-
ed record on the line at Fitzgerald
Field House.

One Pitt player who was here
under Calipari and now is a Pitt
assistant himself is not surprised
at the coach’s success.

“Everyone in the college bas-
ketball world knew he was going
to be a success in coaching,” says
Sean Miller, a point guard for the
Panthers from 1988 to 1992 and
the team’s all—time leader in
assists. Calipari was born in the
Pittsburgh suburb of Moon and
attended Moon Area High
School. He earned a scholarship
to the University of North
Carolina at Wilmington and
played there for two years before

familiar sideline

The John Calipari File:

transferring to nearby Clarion  School:
University. But it was not a play-
ing career that Calipari longed
for.

“I’ve dreamed about being a
coach since I can remember,”
Calipari says in a Pitt media
guide from the 1986-1987 sea-
son. “l’ve always wanted to be a
coach.”

Calipari began his coaching
career soon after graduating
Clarion. His first stop was the
University of Vermont, where as
an assistant he revamped their
recruiting program.

His friendship with Bob Hill, a
Pitt assistant coach under Tim
Grgurich and now a head coach
in the NBA, landed him his next
job —— as an assistant at Kansas,
where he eventually worked with

another NBA boss, Larry Brown.

Miami
°From page P3

Hurricanes. Pitt went on a 7-0
run over the next minute,
fueled by the first of Andre
Alridge’s four 3-pointers, trim-
ming Miami’s lead to 48-37.

With eight minutes remain-
ing, Alridge continued his per- -
sonal struggle to get Pitt back
into the game. From three feet
behind the NBA arc, he drained
a long jumper that put Miarni’s
lead under double digits for the
first time since the first half.

Alridge then drained a three
in the left corner, and ‘suddenly
Pitt trailed 51-45 with 6:45 left
in the game. Hurricane center
Steve Rich ended Pitt’s 15-3
run with a nifty spinning layup,
but Alridge went back down
the court and drained another
trifecta. Alridge led the
Panthers with 12 points.

Pitt’s stingy second-half
defense caused 14 turnovers,
which helped Pitt back into the
game.

With Pitt down by five,
McCullough found himself on
the foul line after the Pitt
defense forced another

turnover. He converted both
foul shots, and Pitt was down
by only three points, at 53-50,
with 4: 10 remaining.

Although the Pitt guards led
them back into the game,
Willard was not pleased with
the overall performance.

“We can’t win games when
our guards take 15 shots and
nine shots. Going into the
game, I said that ball reversal
would be a key, and we didn’t
do it,” Willard_said, referring to
the team total of 10 assists for
the game.

Miami weathered Pitt’s run,
however, and enjoyed a six-
point lead with just 54.8 sec-
onds left on the clock.
McCullough then drained
another Panther three, Pitt’s last
ﬁeld goal, and Pitt once again
only trailed by three points, 60-
57.

Miami (9-6, 3-4), iced the
game at the line as Pitt (8-5, 3-
3) lost its second consecutive
conference game after thump-
ing ‘Georgetown 75-56 on Jan.
9

“The guys we don’t want to

foul at the end of a game, Steve
Edwards and little Norris, we
foul. It’s unbelievable,” Willard
said.

Pitt shot only 36 percent
from the field and a dismal 56
percent from the free throw line
for the game. Pitt’s defense,
which leads the Big East by
allowing only 27 percent on 3-
point shots, let Miami shoot
six-for-12 (50 percent) and 48
percent from the field.

“The 3-point defense was
definitely a factor,” Willard
said. “Edwards hit four of
those, but we need to make him
drive to the basket. Michael
Gill did a great job on him in
the second half.”

This Tuesday, the No.1,
undefeated UMass Minutemen
travel to Fitzgerald Field
House to play Pitt, marking the
first time a No.1 team has
played at Pitt. All-American
center Marcus Camby has been
cleared by team physicians to
play Tuesday night. Tipoff is
scheduled for 9 p.m., and the
game will televised on
ESPN2.

know. that,” Calipari told Joe Burris of the
Boston Globe. “It’s going to be hard. For us to
go 2-0 out of there will be a major, major
accomplishment.” ‘ .

Pitt has to come out and play with the same
intensity it did against Georgetown if it wants
to have a chance at an upset. The Panthers need
to execute both offensively from behind the 3-
point arc, and defensively in its 1-3-1 trapping
press.

If Camby does return, all eyes will be on cen-
ter Gerald Jordan, who will have to play the
biggest game of his short Pitt career. Jordan
will have to play above his 10 point per game,
seven rebound per game averages.

Guard Jerry McCullough (15 ppg, 6 rpg) will
have the duty of controlling the tempo. And
Garrick Thomas must continue his torrid shoot-
mg.

And, of course, there is the sixth man —
Fitzgerald Field House —- where over the last‘
11 years, Pitt is 87-20, including 54-10 the last
six years.

“To have them up in the Field House is defi-
nitely to our advantage,” Miller said.

°From page P3

Porter, who finished with 22 points,
spent most of the second half onthe bench
after picking up her fourth foul at the 11:48
mark, allowing the Lady Panthers to hold
on to their lead.

“I thought we did a relatively good job
on her inone respect,” Bruce said. “We
took it to her offensively. She picked up
early fouls. She picked up her fourth in the
middle of the second half. That’s a long
time to have four fouls.” _

Boston College threatened a comeback
after Campbell hit a layup and converted a
foul shot after being fouled by Kelly
Senneca. The three-point play cut Pitt’s
lead to 48-42 at the 9:26 mark.

But Farrah Woods countered for the

her own just seven seconds later.

In a battle of centers, Latia Howard led

Marcus Camby or no Marcus Camby,
UMass will have its hands full when
it takes the floor against the Panthers.
Without Camby the man—child, the
Minutemen struggled Saturday
against a much weaker Duquesne
squad at the A.J. Palumbo Center and
only won by four. The difference in
the game was the 33 points reserve
guard Carmelo T ravieso put up for
UMass, hitting seven of eight from
beyond the 3-point arc.
Along with Edgar Padilla, Head

Coach John Calipari could have one

of the best backcourts in the country.
But one must remember that
Duquesne does not have the manpow-
er to guard much of anybody. Pitt, on
the other hand, has played well
defensively so far this season, high-
lighted by the stiﬂing of
Georgetown’s Allen lverson en route
to a Panther romp.

The scenario is perfect for Ralph
Willard and his cast of merry men to
ruin John Calipari’s homecoming.
The 9:00 p.m. tip-off on ESPN 2 will
take place at a sold-out Fitzgerald
Field House. This means that the

thousands of students going to the
game have an extra hour and a half to
liquor up. As childish as that may
seem, it will make a difference if the
Panthers are in the game.

A perfect way to get the booze
ﬂowing would be to remind Panther
fans of Calipari’s snubbing of Pitt
last week in response to playing with-
out Camby, saying that they didn’t
have any tough games coming up in
which Marcus would be sorely
missed.

Maybe Calipari should call up John
Thompson sometime before Tuesday

and talk about tough games.

Not many people, including myself,
gave the Panthers a chance against
the then-No. 5 Hoyas. All the
Panthers did was come out and con-
trol every facet of the game in a 19-
point win.

1 Thanks to stubborn Civic Arena
security, fans could not storm the
court to celebrate the win. Good
thing those same guards won’t be
anywhere near campus Tuesday.

Pitt News.

Calipari  

°Fr0m page P5 .
He was at Kansas for the recruitment of All-American Danny
Manning.
Calipari was hired by Roy Chipman in 1985 as the assistant in

‘ charge of recruiting. When Evans came in, Calipari was the only

coach to keep his job.

Although his stay at Pitt wasn’t long, Calipari did have a big inﬂu-
ence with a top recruiting class that included Miller, Bobby Martin,
Darelle Porter and Jason Matthews.

“Coach Calipari is a very dynamic person who can really relate to
anyone,” said Miller about his former coach. “He captivates anyone
around him.” 0

Miller said the Panthers are excited to be going against the No. 1
team in the country, but they also realize it’s just one game.

“We can’t get too excited about it. We have another big game real
soon [UConn].”

It seems that every game is a big one for Calipari and his
Minutemen, as the national spotlight focuses on his team.

Calipari could not be reached for comment but did say in The
Associated Press that “it will be hard for us to win these games,”

referring to the Pitt and Duquesne games. UMass held off the Dukes _

Saturday at the A.J. Palumbo center 93-89.

One result of Calipari’s success, besides media scrutiny, is job
offers. He has been rumored to be in line for various head coaching
posts throughout the college and professional basketball world.

But for now, he seems to be content building a dynasty in Amherst,
and despite the A-10 titles and coaching awards, there is still one

‘ more championship he ‘needs to make his resume complete.

Walter Camp Awards while finishing second to
South Carolina’s George Rogers in the Heisman
Trophy balloting. Green’s second-place finish is
the highest by any purely defensive player in the
history of the award. Green was also selected to
Street & Smith's All-Decade first team for the ‘70s
and was named Sporting News Player of the Year.

Green, along with Ricky Jackson and Bill Fralic,
formed possibly the best defense in college foot-
ball history. In his four years here, Green tabbed a
cumulative record of 39-8-0, including back-to-
back ll-1 seasons in his last two years and victo-

ries against Arizona in the 1979 Fiesta Bowl and
South Carolina in the 1980 Gator Bowl.

Pitt’s all-time sack leader with 53 and second
all-time leading tackler with 441 (behind Arnie
Weatherington), Green is one of four Panthers who
has had his jersey retired. Green’s No. 99 is
accompanied by those of Tony Dorsett,-Dan
Marine and Fralic.

A first—round pick of the ‘Tampa Bay

' Buccaneers, Green played five years there before

completingvhis 10-year professional career with
the Miami Dolphins. He was twice named to the
Pro Bowl.
