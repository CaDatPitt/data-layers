With their defeatist complex hanging above
their heads much the same as the sword of
' Damacles, Pitt’s worn-out gridders will enter the
fray against Ohio State tomorrow afternoon in
quest of their ﬁrst victory of the season. P
Like in all the other games, the Blue and Gold
will be on the short end of the odds. But odds are
not always right on the Buckeye-Panther tilts
as characterized by last year’s game. Pitt entered
the contest against Ohio State on even terms, but
were lucky enough to emerge with their lives. ,

Still possessing ﬁght and determination if

nothing else, the local aggregation is due for at

good afternoon, and with all the old gradsback
in town, it sounds logical that tomorrow should
be the day.

Pitt Seeks First Win

 

Students were requested today to bring cash contributions
for the United Fund drive to school for the third. hour Mon-
day and Tuesday when 80 members of the student body and
80 members of the faculty will speak in classrooms for the
Fund and collect contributions.

Speakers will meet today at 3:30 o'clock in 33? Cathedral
with Theodore Biddle, acting dean of men, who is In charge
of the campaign.

Mr. Biddle said the committee feels that each student
should give to the point of personal sacriﬁce. The goal is a
contribution from each student and an average of $1.50 per
person.

He minted out that contributions of parents does not
exempt the students from their responsibility to participate
‘in the University campaign.

Any students not solicited in class may make their sub-
. scription at the offices of the dean of men or clean of women.

With the exception of 30 per cent, ﬁve per cent more than
last year, which willbe given to the Community Fund, all the
proceeds will go to Universities agencies. _

The student, loan fund will be increased with 30 percent of

the year to men and women students who need necessary
loans.

1
Twenty per cent each will go to the YMCA and YWCA,
while Pitt in China will be given ﬁve per cent.

' Besides ordinary maintenance ofthe University YM and
YW, the amount for these groups is used for Pitt Town meet-
iiigs, freshman camp, Caritas, Chi Rho Nu seminars, Sharman
group, freshman clubs, and other seminars.

Pitt-in-China consists of the University’s maintenance at
Lingnan university in China‘ of sundry scholarships and the
sending of books.

Classroom captains and aides will distribute contribution
envelopes in the various classes, collect them, and then issue
receipt envelopes containing a red feather and tag.
dents not displaying the tag or feather on Tuesday wil be
approached for contributions.

Formerly, contributions for YMCA, YWCA, student loan
fund, etc., were carried on in separate campaigns. Recently
all these drives were combined with the Community Fund in
one solicitation. Now this year’s drive represents the united
appeal of ﬁve separate soliciting groups united under this
year’s United Fund and under this year’s slogan of “United.

 lUnquestionably there has,

The mounting impatience with industrial dis-
utesexpressed by the president in his speech to
the American Federation of Labor convention
}‘and seconded by “the voice of the people” in the
latest Gallup poll bears an investigation;
S .. Let us ask and try to answer, on the "basis of
he facts, some very pertinent questions.
Is there an epidemic of strikes?
7 Strikes are more frequent and serious this year
than during peaceful 1940 when only six million
‘man days of work were lost. Labor department
statistics show a trend this year toward the
ii reatest number of strikes since turbulent 1937.
ut the statistical increase is largely the reﬂec-

on of a couple of big strikes like the bituminous .

oal battle which shut down mines for the whole

of ‘April.

"Has there been any basis for these strikes?

_ if results of
National Labor Relations Board decisions mean
Janything. In 47 per cent of the cases where
ﬁunions haye struck for higher wages and shorter

 

hours they have been given a favorable decision.
Of the rest of the cases 41 per cent were settled
on a compromise basis. Where questions of union
recognition were involved results were very much
the same-—and the complexion of the board is
hardly pinkish. Furthermore, living costs have
been rising. ~ ,

ls defense production  slowed down?

During 1940, in what the department of labor
classiﬁed as the 11 vital defense industries, one-
quarter of one per cent of the total number of
mandays worked was lost on strikes. Yet the lag
of defense production behind plans has been far
greater than can properly be blamed on work
stoppages.

Do strikes mean deliveries are being held up?
Not necessarily. Accumulated stocks in the in-

dustry may enable deliveries to be kept constant."

Besides, _a strike may be called in a factory where
production of a particular part is ahead of the

capacity to assemble the ﬁnal product. If, for ex-

ample, there are more propellers than airplane

it a death blow.

motors, a strike in the propeller division of an
aircraft factory may not slow up assembly of
airplanes at all. - .3

Is, then, this mounting impatience justified?

It would be if every other element of the nation
were putting forth an all-out effort and if we
were taking the same attitude toward self-inter-V
ested policies of various industrial concern.s. But
it is not if we seek to excuse all the weaknesses
of the defense effort by pointing an accusing ﬂip
ger at labor and if we let companies like Alcoa
get away with what they do. It is not if we plan
tospank labor without making a pass at the just
as attractive rump of capital.

It would be wise, at this time, to be on the
lookout for the scapegoat hunters, _who in an
attempt to screen their own shortcomings,_ attack
unions. Their aim: to place all the blame for 
tlenecks on the workers; their motive, to_make
the most of this opportunity to discredit the
labor movement generally and if possible deal it:

Wonder how many Aid to Britainers rushed to
their nearest liquor or department store before the
new taxes went on.

In a nation‘ that's speaking of destiny and saving
the world in one breath it is odd to find that the
money for the adventure has to be raised by prom-
ising : return on the cash’ invested. Apparently
Yankee paternalism will cost in the end. Uncle Sam
will pay interest even if he has to tax the poor to
do it. — ' \

Surely no sane isolationist would invest his hard

Halo ~ A

It’s disgusting to ﬁnd the halo being injected into
another war. While we are positive God is on our
side, it may be because Hitler gives Him little choice.
Be careful, gentlemen, or the halo may become a
noose.

Britain versus Germany

While many Americans have leaped with ven-
geance on the fact of Britains failure to divert Ger-
many from Russialby an invasion of the continent,
they still hold the evacuation of Dunkirk as a mod-
ern miracle. These people forget that Britain took
approximately 250,000.men without equipment from
a region where small boats could be employed while
the RAF held local mastery of the air. Now these
critics want 2 million men landed tomorrowaat 6 PM
with full equipment. Gentlemen, are we dressing
for dinner?

Scorched 

If Britain had applied the Russian tactics to the
oil wells of Rumania what effect would it have had
on the seige of Odessa?

Revelation

Who will write the exposes of this war? Maybe it’

would ‘be more- humane if the government would
frown upon the indoctrination of the younger gen-
eration. The revelations written during the last 15
years concerning the horrors and injustices of war,
the creation of nearly 3,000 millionaires and the she-
nanigans _of thepoliticians has made it difficult to
work up war enthusiasm. Fifteen year thought pat-
terns can not be changed overnight.

Now that the first big dance of
the year is over and every one is
nursing his or her shins, here are
some of the highlights of the af-
fair: ' V

lovely in a. red creation that had
all the new Pitt men talking.  la
rue Clemmer had . good time ~ just
keeping the wolves away. ‘

Norm ‘Marcus seemed to think
he. was meant to be the leader of
the band and thus took over the
baton from maestro Astor. The

only catch to the whole deal. was "

that the players paid‘ little if any
attentionlto him- The only thing
we could see that was outstanding
about the band was that they all
needed haircuts. There is "such a.
thing as long hair and then there
is long hair but the band for 42 took
the prize. A '

lt seems each Saturday there lb
lots of excitement over A certain
prettyboy named Westerman. No
sooner does the band sit dowli
than there is a chorus of “Put on
your hat, Westerman.” lt could
be that they don't like blonde curls
and then it could be that they don’t
like blondes or perhaps they just
don't like. Who knows?

While speaking of the band, it
was really swell for the spectators

to know just what they were doing
on the ﬁeld Saturday. With the
innovation of the PA system do-.
scribing each formation it really
sets off the best band in the east,

Ace jitterbug Homer King was
sort of quiet at the Soph hop. It
couldn't have been that the datq
was slow, or could it? Also Peg-
gy Johns couldn't make up hes!
mind whether. it was more impose
tant ‘to lift her arm» in the air 3'
each turn or holdher dress down.
Anyhow she compromised and on-
eryone was satisﬁed.

Evy Smith seems to get along
quite nicely with Al McArdle. It
seems as though once a girl starts
going with 9. Phi Gain the boys
don’t like to see her leave. We
think it was Bill Clemmer that
started her on her career.

Surely there is no more love for

What, then is the reason for our
laxity? Though numerous ele-
ments enter into the ﬁnal analysis,
we would accuse the abnormal eco-
nomic condition of the nation as
being mainly responsible. When
the wealthiest nation in the world
has ten million unemployed, who
aren’t even absorbed in a period
of all-out production; when a third
of the people don’t even have the
necessities of decent living in a
country abundant in resources and
production, there is something‘
deﬁnitely wrong.

smear you but even though they
write on sports I can't think of
them as being sporting.

They never mention that you
come back each Saturday beaten
and battered, and prepare for the
next game. They don't seem to
know that feeling of despair you
get when everything you do goes
wrong.

No, and they never tell that
sometimes you want to lie'down
and bawl because you can’t do a
thing against your opponent. They
forget that you could forfeit
games very easily if you didn't
have guts to play them.

As I said before, there are still

a lot of us behind you. We feel
as badly as you over defeats. But
we .know that some Saturday

you're going to give some fine, rit-
zy team a wonderful shellacking.
How about making this Saturday

Why Don’t Some People
Want To Defend The U.3.?

The populace, especially the

youth who were brought up in the

depression and felt its full impact,
can't understand why we should
undertake to spread economic free-
dom in countries whose names
they can hardly pronounce when
there isn't even a semblance of it
here. A ’

-We are not assuming the same

attitude, inasmuchaswe think a,

Hitler victory must precede any
correction of the situation. But
we can understand’ their feelings.

The easiest remedy would be to
have a totalitarian government, but
that, as has been demonstrated
quite conclusively, brings with it
a number of evils greater than the
cures it effects.

The only answer as we see it
is to strike up the proper balance
between government planning and
private enterprise. Those com-
modities which are necessary for
the imaintainance of 1i'fe should be
under strict government supervi-
sion. The others can be produced
under the proﬁt system with less
or no regulation.

Regardless of the method how-
ever, the abolishment of slums,
unemployment, doles and relief, is
the only answer to world salvation.
Give a man something to defend
and he will defend it.

Neocracy: The Best  

By FRANK MASTORAKI» —

Largely through the efforts of
the press in Austin, Texas, a new
type of, economic organization is
receiving‘ nation-wide publicity.

This economic organization, call-
ed Neocracy also called Neo-Econ-
omy and Free Economy, is an eco-
nomic system based on the investi-
gations, ﬁndings and proposals of
the South American business man
and economic thinker, Silvio Ge-
sell.

Exponents of Free Economy de-
scribe it as capitalism stripped of
every vestige of exploitation and
as Socialism stripped of every
tendency to bureaucratic totalita-
rianism.

Cycles for the purpose of re-
porting——-not explaining —— certain
economic phenomena, have been
set forth _by modern economists.

‘The economists reporting on the
business cycle which takes place in
capitalistic economy ascertain that
the “recovery - prosperity - crisis-
depression cycle is inevitable."
Advocates of Neocracy have
“bIue-printed?’ the cycle that would
result from their scheme of eco-
nomic organization.

ln the Neocl-at’s “Cycle of Free-
dom and Plenty" they presuppose
the following:

“Freedom and plenty will be the
result of the Neo E_conomy.” (Eric
Knight in his book “This Above
All” called for both “bread and
freedom.” Is he a Neocrat?)

“Neo Economy requires
money.

“Neo money is constitutional
money.” (Is our present currency
unconstitutional ?)

“Constitutional money is gov-
ernment issued money.

“Government issued money per-
mits money regulation.

“Money regulation necessitates
unhoardablemoney.” (There's just
as much money in times of depres-
sion as in times of prosperity, only
in the former it is “saved" while
in the latter it is circulating. Have
they something there?)

Neo

  Of All Economies

“Unhoardable money ﬁnances
capacity production." (There has
never been capacity production in
the United States, but it is some-
thing to work for.)

“Capacity production means jobs
for all." (Can any professor of
economics be more theoretical?)

“Jobs for all result in rising
wages.” (Not as unbelievable as
the fact that 70 percent of our
population receives from $500 to
$2000 a year which is only 43
percent of the total income.)
“Rising wages permit rising
savings
“Rising savings lead with un-
hoardable money to investments.”
(An easily defended statement.)
. “Investments produce increas-
ing real capital wealth. (No over-

throw of the capitalistic system
here.)

“Inc”-'4S1'f18 real-capital wealth
decreases interest yield.” (Adam
Smlth would not be contradicted
here, neither would Dr. Ferguson.)

“Decreasing interest yield im-
Pd! lowered money interest.
“ 0 n u
Lowered money interest facili-
tates productlon.” (Karl Marx,

Henry Ford, Herr Hitler, President .

Roosevelt in unison cry ‘Aye’.)

“Facility of production will en- 
force freeing of land and nat- 

ural resources.”
George’s cue. Remember him? He
Wrote “Progress and Poverty"

which advocated re-distribution of
the land.)

(This is Henry

_ “Full Proceeds of labor estab.
llshes justice for all." (Tl-mt is

where John Lewis comes in and"

Joe Pew. President of the Sun on
Co., goes out.) A

Justice for all realizes true

d9m°°l‘aC.V-” (George Washington
could not have worded it better.)

“True democracy will protect
Neo-Economy. .

“Neo Economy, the natural eco-
nomic order, brings freedom and
plenty."

0 Once upon at time the baseball
managers of this nation had a

rather nice. custom. It was a cus-
tom that didn’t have much reason,
but it was observed as rigidly as
the ‘wearing of the green on St.
Patrick’s day, having turkey on
Thanksgiving and kicking out the
manager when the team lost a
game. ‘

At the start of every baseball
season the managers would care-
fully survey their teams. They
,would duly consider the seive-like
inﬁeld, the miserable outﬁeld, and
the batting that was so weak that
the average had to be worked out
with ten decimals. They would
also take into account the strength
of all opponents and "then, they
would each solemnly and deﬁantly
declare “MY team is going to win
the pennant.”

Now this was a very nice cus-

~ anyhow the view from the window was terriﬂc.

Pitt girls wear skirts and

A ~All college girls wear skirts and
sweaters.

In fact this outﬁt has become
as traditionally American as the
cowboy’s boots and saddles. a

A national survey reports that
college women spend 75 per cent
I of their. waking hours in a sweater-
skirt outfit. Just look around the
Tuck shop or Commons room or
open your eyes in your classes.
You'll see cardigans or slipovers,
V or crew necks, long or short

sleeves. Anyhow you’ll see ‘sweat-

ers-—-plenty of them.

Most college girls, including Pitt
co-eds, spend $240.33 a year on
their clothes. Texas beauties,
though, must have 'fat pocket-
books. They spend an average of
$768.

Saddle shoes are still the favor-
ites, but University girls like to
show individualityin their foot-
wear. Gillies or riding boots are
as likely to be seen here as sad-
dles or the ever popular specta-
tors. A Pitt girl's shoe shelf is
usually complete with saddles,
pumps, and a pair of Cinderella
“evening” slippers.

The stocking shortage or the
troublesome “nick” in nylons,
doesn’t bother most college girls.
Legs are bared to the cool breezes
at the stadium with only ankle
socks as protection. Some girls
even knit their own. Most college
women dislike the knee-length
socksinow on the market. Only
six per cent wear them. 26 per
cent rate the rubber boot——func-

Symphony ;
Seeks New

M A ' ' ns

For the beneﬁt of freshman
women who have been heard to
moan because they could not join

some activity, the Symphony or-
chestra of Pitt calls attention to

itself. It is a mixed undergraduate
organization of about 50 students,
including freshman women.

Directed by Robert L. J:Afthur,
assistant dean of men and also di-
rector of the Pitt band, the orches-
tra meets every Thursday evening
from 7 to 9 o'clock in 2317 Ca-
thedral.

In addition to the music on hand

from previous years, four new
symphonies have been added to the
collection: Schubert’s “Unﬁnished

Symphony,” his “Rosamunde,”
Tschaikows-ky’s “N u t c r a c k e- r

Suite,” and Victor Herbert’s “For-
tune Teller.”

Richard Hartz, BA43, manager
of the orchestra, announces that
the home concert has been sched-
uled for April 27, while other con-
certs will be arranged, if possible,
for Pittsburgh and vicinity.

Throughout the year different
social events are held to add to the
interest and fun of the members
and to re-ward them for their
many hours of practice. As a cli-
max to the year there is a banquet
at which time orchestra keys are
awarded to all active, members.

A few positions in the string
sections are still open; also, Mr.
Arthur would like to interview
oboe, clarinet, and bassoon play-
ers who are interested and can
classify. , .

And women are welcome!

Alpha Omega Initiates
Tomorrow evening Alpha Ome-
Uga dental fraternity will hold a
banquet and dance in honor of the
initiation of ﬁfteen neophytes and
the pledging of three new men in
the Venetian room of Hotel Web-
ster Hall.

It made the club
happy, it made the fans happy,
and it made the players not overly
conscious of the futility of it all.

But then reason stepped in. And
now at the start of every sea-_
son the managers duly observe
their teams and the teams of their
opponents, and then blithly pre-
dict “The OTHER team is going
to win.” v

Now this is a very frank, reason-
able way of going about things.
Off hand you can ﬁnd nothing
wrong with it except that it seems
to us that baseball lost a lot when
the managers began thinking with
their heads rather than their
hearts.

All of this is apropos of the
spirit or rather lack of it _that has
been evident on campus this year.
It seems that the “do or die for
dear old Rutgers” is no more. The
cynical, calloused views of the so-
called moderns have replaced the
thing called “the old college spir-
it.” Frank Merriwell has been
scuttled.

Spirit used to run so high that
for every nose broken on the foot-
ball field there were sure to be six
more broken in the stadium by dis-
senting spectators.

For anyone to even suggest that
Pitt might not win a game was
one of the better ways of commit-
ting suicide.

But things are different now.

Candidates for February gradu-
ation in the School of Education

are required to remove all “C”

grades by Dec. 1. The seniors af-
fected by this notice should con-
tact the instructor who issued the
incomplete grade and make ar-
rangements to complete the re-
quired work.

Honorary legal fraternities have
no houses. They sponsor periodic
dinners, dances and Saturday night
socials.

Rushing in the legal fraternities
differs from the undergraduate
rush week. Each fraternity holds
one rushing party after which bids
are issued and within a week the
rushees have been pledged.

”Stay—.h ere "
Attitude IS
. Pre Vczlent

Austin, Texas, October 31.——Un- i
like most US adults, a majority‘
of American college students are 1
opposed to changing the neutral- ‘
ity law to allow supply ships to .
be armed and sent into the war 3

zone. The majority, however, is

slim with 51 per cent of the na- ‘ "
tion’s students against a Change. J

This isolationist attitude is‘dis-
covered in the first poll of the
school year completed last week
by Student Opinion Surveys of
America. The nation-wide can-

vassing also reveals overwhelming '

sentiment against actualﬁghting in
the war, and growing pessimism on
campuses about the country's abil-
ity to avoid the conflict.

Results on the question
neutrality law so that American

supply ships may be armed and
sent into war zones?” were:

In favor _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ __42 per cent
Against _______ _;_-51 per cent
Undecided _______ _. 7 per cent

Students were asked also “What
do you believe is more important
for the United States to do, de-
clare war
forces where‘ needed, or try to
keep out as long as possible and
supply the nations ﬁghting Hitler
and Japan?” Returns were:

Declare war and ﬁght, 14 per cent
Stay out and supply, 79 per cent
Undecided _ _ . _ _ _ _ __ 7 per cent

The latest Gallup poll, taken
like the_student survey, since Con-
gress took up neutrality revision,
reported a ratio of 46 to 40 per
cent in favor of mounting guns on
American ships and 54 per cent
approving American ships and
crews delivering’ supplies to Bri-
tain.

Optimism on America’s staying
out of the war is diminishing, a
survey chart shows. Forty-two per
cent of the nation’s students now
believe we can stay out. Percent-
age on this question in December,
1939 was as high as 68 per cent;
December, 1940, 63 per cent, and
February, 1941, 49 per cent.

Student Opinion surveys, non-
profit cooperative organization of
150 college newspapers, including
the Pitt News, mathematically con-
trolls its cross-section of student
opinion.

Sales Campaign
Reveals Results

For Past Week

_ Owl sales campaign, now in its
second week, has produced gratify-
ing results, according to Dan
Mash, C43, circulation manager.

Seniors and undergraduates alike
have been cooperating with the
Owl and purchasing or making the
deposits on the 1942 yearbook on
schedule, continued Mash.
Referring to yearbook deposits,
said Mash, “I wish to remind
seniors that a receipt must be
presented at Photo Reflex studio
before a picture will be taken.”
Tomorrow is the last day for
senior men, whose last names be-
gin with A to D inclusive and for
senior women with last names be-

Football Squad

By GENE FRIEDMAN
Sports Editor, Ohio State Lantern

Probably much to the surprise of
Pittsburgh fans, Ohio State is not
entering'the game Saturday with
any particular air of conﬁdence.
The Buckeyes know that Pitts-

burgh is a much better team than

its record indicates.

The Buckeyes are aware that
Pittsburgh’s greatest difficulty has
been lack of capable reserves, the
same diﬂiculty that Ohio State has
been encountering this year. The
Buckeyes are cognizant of the fact

STAN GERVELIS
. . . Golden Panthers

that Pittsburgh’s- running attack
was very effective against Minne-
sota.

Brown Worries

All these factors combined are
enough to give Coach Paul Brown
worries were he not partially ab-
sorbed in the problem of assem-
bling and reconstructing the Ohio
State football squad for Saturday's
game.

Seven regulars were injured in
the clash with Northwestern. How-
ever, ﬁve are expected to be ready
to go this week for certain.’

The most important question
right now is whether or not left
halfback Dick Fisher, who has an
infected right arm, will be in con-

By ELAINE KAHN

When Ohio State called upon
Paul Brown last year to take over
its football coaching reins, more
than one eyebrow was lifted. For
here was one of the major grid
powers of the east hiring a mere
high school coach. However, Paul
Brown’s Massillon High school rec-
ord was an impressive one for his
teams had won a grand total of 81
games while losing only six.

People were still raising their
eyebrows this season as they
watched Brown, working with an
unfamiliar squad and one which
had lost heavily through gradua-
tion, chalk up wins over Missouri,
Southern Cal, and Purdue before
ﬁnally bowing to mighty North-
western.

The 33 year old football mentor
was born in Norfolk, Ohio, but at
an early age the family moved to
Massillon where he grew up. He
attended Massillon High school
where he -won letters in football,
baseball, basketball, and track.

He entered Ohio State and was
active in freshman football and
basketball, but his 140 pounds
proved insuiﬁcient for Western
conference‘ competition.

 

Brown, Wile Combined
Efforts At Massillon

   

Paul /9......

at Miami university where he
played quarterback in football and
the outﬁeld in baseball.

Upon his graduation in 1928 he
accepted the coaching position at
Severn, a prep school for the Unit-
ed States Military academy at All-
napolis. His two-year record there
was ﬁfteen won and two lost.

Two years later he returned to
Massillon High school. The ath-
letic setup was in a badly run down
condition, but once Brown took
over he launched into a program
that brought national fame to his
high school teams. This set the
stage for his accession to the Ohio
State coaching position.

No story about Paul Brown would
be complete without some mention
of Mrs. Brown who has played
a very large part in the success
of her husband's teams. Mrs.
Brown not only washed and ironed

, the uniforms of the Massillon play-

ers, but fed the boys as well.
Whenever a player had scholastic
diﬁiculties Mrs. _Brown personally
undertook the job of tutoring him.
Small wonder then that the Mas-
sillon High teams were virtually
unbeatable. What wouldn't be with

- a combination, like the Brown

dition to play Saturday. At the
present jime Fisher "is the only
Buckeye not participating in prac-
tice. , .
Another question msrk is full-
back Jack Graf, whose knee injury _
kept him out of the Northwestern ‘A
game and may keep him’ from

l‘
i

playing against Pittsburgh. Other ,-

injuries are not expected to keep
the players out but may slow them
up. I
Brown Juggles
With the problems presented by
these two serious injuries, Coach

Brown has been forced to do a cer-
tain amount of juggling. First
string quarterback Johnny Hallu-
brin has been shifted to fullbacln.‘
a spot which he occupied last year.

Sophomore George Lynn will be
first string quarterback Saturday.
Lynn is a ﬁne defensive player and
blocker. Hallabrin, on the other
hand, looked good in the few plays
he ran from the fullback slot
against Northwestern.

Meanwhile Paul Sarringheus,
sophomore, and George Zsvistosko,
senior, are working out at Fisher's
vacant spot. Since Fisher and Gref
did most of the passing, Couch
Brown has been alternating sopho-
more qusrterbnck Dick Palmer at
the fullback spot where he may do
some passing. /

The only other important change
on the Buckeye squad is the pro-
motion of Leon Schoenbaum, soph-
omore ﬁnd of the Wildcat game,
to ﬁrst string left end. The die-
missal of Anderson insured Schoon-
baum’s chance to play, but it was
expected that the sophomore would
have started anyhow in view of his
ﬁne play of last week.

Brown Doubtful

With both teams weak on re-
serves, it can be expected that a
long, grueling battle will result. It
may be a question of whether
Pittsburgh's desire to spring an
upset and newly found spirit com-
bined with Ohio State’s injuries
can overcome the doubtful superi-
ority of the Buckeye squad.

If we lose, everyone will be sur-‘. 

prised, except us. We're looking
for a tough battle-this game be-
ing just another’ game L on the

PiKA Team Extended

By BILL BOYCE
On the touch-football front, the

up and coming PiKA’s scored their
second consecutive win by downing
a ﬁghting Lambda Chi team by ‘a
score of 15 to 0. Neither team
crossed the goal line the first half,
but PiKA capitalized on a fumble
in the second period with Marshall
Morgan carrying it across. An-

“ other fumble by Lambda Chi re-

sulted in a safety and 2 points.
Again it was Morgan, in the wan-
ing moments of the game, who
rang the bell for the PiKA’s. Good
blocking and outstanding defense
play by Dick Fair were also prime
factors in the victory.

A ﬁghting and determined group
of boys from Phi Epsilon Pi squeez-
ed out a 6 to 0 triumph over a
favored Phi Gam seven, defending
intramural champs, in one of the
biggest upsets of the current sea-
son. The regular playing time end-
ed with neither team scoring, but
in the overtime period, a pass from
Phil Dutch to Jimmy Deutelbaum
closed the book with the Phi Eps
victorious. Arnie Biron and Her-
hie Harris stood out for the win-
ners on the line.

Another overtime was needed
when the Phi Delta topped SAM
by a 13 to 6 score. After a score-
les first half, a fumbled kickoff
plus some nice broken ﬁeld run-
ning by “Red" Donahue gave the
Phi Delts a 6 to 0 advantage.
SAM immediately tied the game
with a touchdown pass from Ab-
ramovitz to Sapolski. It was an-
other aerial, Nossek to DeFoe, and
conversion, Andrews to Defoe, that
gave the Phi Delts their hard earn-
ed victory.

In the ﬁnal football game of the
day Sigma Chi defeated the SAE’s
14-12. Foliart and Jordan were
the standouts for the winners.

Following their football loss, Sig-
ma Alpha Mu knocked the Delts
oil’ in speedball, 6-1. The Phi Delts
took the other speedball game of
the day, as the Pi Lams forfeited
to them.

All of the paddle tennis matches
ended in forfeits. Phi. Kappa, Phi

Epsilon Pi, the Phi Gams, and
Sammies were the winners, while

Sigma Chi, Lambda Chi, Theta Chi,
and SAE were the teams that
didn’t. appear for their games.

With their season batting aver-
age reading .500, the Blue and
Gold cross country team will at-
tempt to boost this average when
they charge on the Army forces to-
morrow morning at 9 o’clock on the
West Point course.

For the second straight week, the
Olsenmen will invade a strange
stronghold without any knowledge
of the enemy. It may be a good
thing for the locals, because last
week they chalked up a win over
Case, Hiram, and Bethany in a

quadrangular meet of which the«

Panther board of strategy didn't
have an ounce worth of informa-
tion on which to plan their attack.
Incidentally, this was the second
time in three campaigns that Case
has lost a contest. Overlin was the
only school to knock them off prior
to the Pitt licking.

All week the local trackmen
have been drilling, pointing for
this meet tomorrow. And there
isn't any “blowing” around the
practice site, although the Panther
spikers are just boiling over inside
waiting to get at the Service cross
country men.

The ﬁrst thing that Coach Olson
had to say concerning the Army
team was that they are going to
be “plenty tough.” However, he
still has the old faith in the boys
and went on to say that if the
boys make as promising a showing

Adviser Gives History
Of Nationality Rooms

History and development of the
Cathedral's nationality rooms were
discussed yesterday afternoon by
Mrs. Ruth Crawford Mitchell, ad-
viser on the rooms, during a tour
of the rooms by the Newcomers’
group of the University Women’s
association. Mrs. George Harring-
itbhsi   if

Daffodil, played the simpering
usurper in aspolished a manner
as could be found in many trips to
the amateur theater. Never once
falling out of character, Baugh-
man played with a restraint and
clearness of purpose that was
amazing.

John Reed, Doris, Gillium, and A

Rose Mary Hilliard played raher
well, except for Reed’: occasional
slips into modern western actions
and tones of voice. - - -

Robert Fitzpatrick and George

, ‘ Anas were specially impressive in
_ their weird make-up and Anas’

imaginary riding on a white horse.

Enid Hewlett, as the bereft
mother of the hero was at times
very expressive, but at times over-
did the pathos and made her ex-
cellent part sound high-schoolish.

Small theatre groups
feel it incumbent on them to ex-
periment in one of their plays, and
are prepared to suffer the conse-
quences or enjoy the distinction
that comes with innovation. Yel-
low Jacket as a play failed, but
credit must be given to Mr. Buell
Whitehill and his crew for a noble
effort and excellent work under
adverse conditions. '
