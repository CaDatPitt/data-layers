Women strive for equality

  

By Julie D. Hannon
News Assistant

Elizabeth Baranger walks into a meeting on the
eighth ﬂoor of her Cathedral of Learning office to
ﬁnd she is the only woman in the room among a
barrage of male administrators. The imbalance
frustrates her, but does not come as a surprise.

Being ﬂushed into a male—dominated atmos-
phere hasbecome second nature to the vice
provost of graduate studies, because she comes
from a physics background, where only 7 percent
of PhDs nationally are held by women.

“Major discomforts have arisen in meetings
because you ﬁnd men doing the presentations,
being in charge, while" the audience is primarily
composed of women,” says Baranger. “I have
unfortunately ‘become accustomed to being the
only woman or one of the few women in a room

or in an office because of my background, so it’s .

not something restricted to Pitt alone.”

Baranger is one of 39 women at Pitt who holds
a position classiﬁed as an executive/adrninistra-
tive ranking. The remaining 100 positions are held

by men. And although women account for more
than half of the student population, only 29 per-
cent of faculty are women, meaning that a student
has only a one-in-three chance of being taught by
a woman. A s

As Pitt marks its 100—year anniversary of
women on campus, it’s obvious that women have
made enormous strides in academics by account-
ing for 55 percent of the 14.3 million students
enrolled in universities and colleges nationwide
last year, but the statistics also show that as
women have inched their way into the corridors
of academia, progress has been slow.

As long ago as 1900, women made up 20 per-
cent of all university faculty members, according
to the October issue of The Monthly Forum on
Women In Higher Education. By 1981 the per-
centage of women faculty increased nationwide to
only 26.8 percent. Last year, the percentage grew
to 32 percent, increasing only 12 percentage
points in a 95-year span. So the disproportionate
numbers at Pitt reﬂect the inequality which spans

the country._ 3

ZBT bros
turn them-

selves in  

By Jackie Duggan

Chloe Wood/Staff Potographer

Desaire Moore enjoys the warm weather on the Cathedral Lawn Wednesday .

The three Zeta Beta Tau broth-
ers who took Polaroid pictures of
women showering in the Towers
as part of" a fraternity scavenger
hunt turned themselves in
Wednesday morning.

Scott Borsky and Gregory
Gallina, both 18 and residents of
Tower B, and Michail Losifidis,
19, all reported to the Pitt Police
station and were very coopera-
tive, said Pitt Police Chief Rick
Boyd.

“They were served their war-
rants and taken to the Public
Safety Building [downtown] to
wait for arraignment,” Boyd said.

The brothers are charged" with
harassment, criminal trespass and
criminal conspiracy.

“Technically, they could be sent
to jail for any of the three
charges,” Boyd said.

Steve Rosenthal, president of
ZBT, did not wish to comment for
legal reasons, but did say he was
preparing a press release for the
media. He said the individuals
were new brothers, not pledges,
and there is “no connection
between this incident and haz-
ing.”

Greek Advisor Kerry Daley
said an internal investigation is
underway.

“There is an administrative
process in following fraternity
and sorority infractions,” she said.

Last Sunday the three brothers
ran through women’s bathrooms
in Tower B, opening shower cur-
tains and taking pictures of naked
female students. The brothers
were brought in by Pitt Police for
questioning and later confessed.

Serbs release 300 hostages

' Wor|d Events

MONTREAL -— Premier
Jacques Parizeau, Quebec’s
leader of the separatist Parti
Quebecois, resigned yesterday,
raising questions about the
direction of the separatist

movement following its narrow '

defeat in an independence ref-
erendum.

The resignation came as a
shock following his bitter com-
ments on Monday evening,
blaming “money and the ethnic
vote” for the defeat.

Instead of resolving the issue

A. of Quebec’s future, the slim

victory by those who want
Canada to stay united has led

_ some separatists to vow the

fight is far from over. But not
all agree with Parizeau’s efforts
to blame the immigrants for the
loss. The New York Times

BANJA LUKA — The
Bosnian Serb authorities hasti-
ly handed over 300 male
Muslim civilians on Monday in
exchange for 150 Serbian pris-
oners of war one to pressure
from Washington and in an
attempt to make a good
impression at the start of the
peace talks in Ohio.
The Assistant Secretary of
. State for Human Rights, John
Shattuck, said he gained com-
mitments from Serb leadership

and that the release should be
seen as just the initial step in a
series of actions.

With the peace talks nearing,
American officials have raised
questions of the whereabouts
and conditions of the Bosnian
men who were evicted from
their homes in northwestern
Bosnia this month. The New
York Times

ANKARA, Thrkey — Prime
Minister Tansu Ciller has pro-
posed lifting martial law in
southeastern Turkey, where the
military has fought separatist
Kurdish rebels for 11 years.

The proposal won approval
yesterday from President
Suleyman Demirel to form a
new coalition government,
bringing an end to a month-
long political crisis.

A coalition will serve until
Dec. 24, when the citizens vote
in general elections. It’s
expected to pass easily as a
vote of confidence in
Parliament on Sunday. The

WASHINGTON — The CIA

it never warned government

WASHINGTON — President

on Tuesday to a meeting on

The Pitt News, Thursday, November 2, 1995

Women

°From page 1

Sophomore Jennifer
Townsend, a political science
major, said she was surprised at
the lack of women on Pitt’s fac-
ulty.

“I only have one female
instructor, and she’s a graduate
student. I’d prefer to have
women professors —— at least
one,” says Townsend. “Students
need a different perspective and
more diversity, because that’s
what you often grow up with —
a male-dorninated atmosphere,-
and it’s good to experience
something different.”

In tenns of paychecks, women
again lag behind their male
peers. For fall term 1994, the

average salary for a full-time‘

male professor at Pitt was
$77,300, while his female coun-
terpart with the sarne full-time
stature made a whopping $7,600
less per year, according to the
March/April 1995 issue of
Academe.

Nationally, when salaries of
male and female faculty are com-

- pared, once again women simply

don’t get equal pay for equal
work. On average, women earn
less at every faculty level. In
1993, full-time female professors
earnedon average only 88 per-
cent of their male peers, accord-
ing to the October issue of The
Monthly Forum on Women in
Higher Education. Even entry-
level salaries for women dropped
below those of men.

But Baranger says although

the advances are slow in coming, '

Pitt is striving to shorten the gen-
der gap in both the number of
women faculty members and
administrators. She says the
salary question is an injustice and
is on the agenda of equality. In
fact, Baranger was assigned an
active role in the equality efforts
at Pitt in May of this year by
Provost James Maher. '

She provides leadership for a
number of matters related to
women’s concerns, including
conducting cohort studies related
to the movement of women
through the tenure" stream, where
she reported that among faculty
who are tenured at Pitt, only 18
percent are women.

Baranger points out that histo-

I ry has been made with the
' appointment of associate profes-

sor of German Beverly Harris-
Schenz to the role of vice provost
of faculty affairs. When Harris-
Schenz takes office in January, it
will be the first time that two out
of five senior administrators in
the provost’s office are women.
Harris-Schenz agrees that

being an oddity doesn’t come as

a shock, because not only is she a
woman, she is an African-
American woman who teaches
Gennan.

“Having a Ph.D. in German
and being black isn’t a daily

currence. I’m truly a minority
i-. the field,” says Hanis-Schenz.
‘ I’ve become so accustomed to
' ing the only black in the room,
and often the only woman, that
when there is more thanone
black or a number of women,
that’s when I notice and am sur-
prised.”

She believes that it’s important
for an institution to reﬂect the
diversity of those in the institu-
tion at all levels. She says that
Pitt is not alone in being deprived
of the salient views that a true
diversity of people would pro-
vide.

“Young women need role
models. If they. see that there are
no strong women leaders, it
looks as if it is not an achievable
goal for them,” says Harris-
Schenz. “It’s accurate to say that
women have done their home-
work and have met with the
proverbial glass ceiling for no
good reason.” -

Harris-Schenz has been a fac-
ulty member at Pitt on and off for
20 years. She periodically
accepted positions at other insti-
tutions and says that up until her
recent appointment, she had to
leave Pitt in order to obtain better

positions.

‘To me quality and diversity
go hand-in-hand,” says Harris-
Schenz. “Quality doesn’t mean
white and it doesn’t mean male.
That’s one of my focuses for my
position.” '

' Both Baranger and Harris-

Schenz, along with Diane Davis
of the external studies depart-
ment, say the road to equality is
lengthy because traditional views

of women being in the back-

ground are deeply irnbedded into
our culture, not excluding the
social stigmas many women con-
tinue to hold.

“There’s the mistaken notion
that women still have someone to
support them and that they’re not
out actually earning a living,”
says Davis. “It’s so deeply
ingrained in society that it’s
going to take some time to
change those views. And the atti-

tude is not limited to males
alone.”

The numbers are beginning to
improve at Pitt, according to
Patsy Simms, the associate direc-
tor of Pitt’s English writing pro-
gram, who hires the part-time
faculty in the non-ﬁction track.
She says gender plays no role in
the English Department.

“Pitt is actually the first place
where I have not been slighted
salary-wise because I am a
woman,” says Simms, who in the
past has worked for the New
Orleans States-ITEM, the San
Francisco Chronicle and the
Philadelphia Inquirer.

“Newspapers were notorious
for paying women less. Even as
an editor I made less than a male
reporter. It was the notion that
men had families they needed to
support and women didn’t, but
that was some 20 years ago,”

Simms says.

When Simms arrived at the
creative writing program in
1989, there were only two
women faculty, but women cur-
rently account for close to one-
half of the faculty. ,

Progress continues to be made
across the country as well. The
number of women heading
United States colleges and uni-
versities has more than tripled in
the past two decades. Currently,
women make up approximately
16 percent of the presidents of
nearly 3,000 regionally accredit-
ed degree-granting institutions,
up from 12 percent in 1992, 10

percent in 1984 and 5 percent in ' I

1975. Of institutionsiwith enroll-
ments higher than 10,000, how-
ever, women only head 7 per-
cent, according to the American
Council on Educat:ion’s Office of
Women in Higher Education.

that made me feel good.”

Mehta said the Greeks were
very hospitable towards him,
but there were a few who
expressed their disapproval of
an independent Homecoming
king. He said some Greeks
approached him after the elec-
tion and asked him how it felt

to , make a farce out of
Homecoming.

Mehta said Homecoming
shouldn’t be a Greek event
that intimidates independents.
He said he feels it is a student
activity that should be enjoyed
by everyone.

“I don’t have anything
against Greeks,” said Mehta.
“A lot of my friends are

“I spent 70 dollars just on
having my pictures taken and

doesn’t include the money that
everybody else spent for buy-
ing paper, photocopying and
getting other supplies.”

Mehta said he owes most of

and Jennifer Hook, his cam-
paign managers and friends,
who financially and emotion-

you’ll need people like them,”
he said. “You need to find cre-
ative, hard-driven people that
will push you to the limit.”
Mehta was born on June 14,
1972, in Rampald, Uganda, to
Prabhashanker and Bhanunati

-Mehta. Mehta often refers to

them as mama and papa.
Mehta said the beginning of
his life greatly resembles the
beginning of the movie
Mississippi Masala, which
starred Denzel Washington.
“Not so much the romance,

but the ultimatum given to the
people,” he said. “The things
that happened in the beginning
of that movie is exactly what
happened to me and my fami-
ly.”
The Mehta’s were forced to
leave Uganda when he was
only three months old as a
result of a civil war that
occurred in 1972. Idi Amin,
the general of Uganda’s army,
demanded those who weren’t
natural-born citizens must
leave.

Neither of his parents were
born in Uganda. his father is
from India, and his mother is
from elsewhere in Africa. The
Mehtas fled Amil’s birth
place.

Mehta family migrated to
Columbia, Pa., where his
mother worked in a sewing
factory and his father became
a self-employed notary public.
The entire family became
American citizens.

Mehta said it is getting more

difficult for him to spend time
with his brothers and sisters,
because they’re consumed
with their careers. But, he still
values his relationship with
his siblings as sacred.

sister works as a business
manager for Fulton Bank in
Lancaster. His 27-year-old
brother Sanjayworks for
Tandem Computers in San
Francisco. And his 32-year-
old brother Shailesh works for
the federal government in
Mechanicsburg.

Mehta said Columbia is a
small town with approximate-
ly 11,000 residents. He gradu-
ated from Columbia Borough
High school in 1991 with 80
other students.

Mehta, a biology major, said
it was the medical program
that attracted him to Pitt. He
spends most of his time study-
ing and working for Dr. Mark
Austin at the Biomedical
Science Tower.

Mehta works in the
Research Department of
Molecular Psychiatry as a lab
assistant. Most of his respon-
sibilities include slide prepara-
tion, making solutions, tissue
sectioning and running
errands.

Mehta has been working for
Austin close to a year now.

While he is indecisive about _

his plans after graduation, he
is certain that he wants to go
to graduate school.

“I’m not sure if I want to go
to medical school, but I do
know that I want to go to
graduate school,” he said. “I
also want to do something
indirectly or directly, to hel
people, because I think that is
what is needed for this coun-
try today.”

Hey. I bet you forgot, but you have that research paper due
on Monday. What? You haven’t even started it yet? We sug-
gest you get your butt into the library and get started.

But wait, it’s Friday night, 7:05 p.m. You might as well just
put your bag down, kick your feet up and drink that beer that
the library staff thinks you were going to be drinking anyway.
You can drink a couple of them, actually, since you can’t start

_working in Hillman until 9 a.m. on Saturday. In fact, just

don’t even bother going to the libraryuntil Sunday, have a
few more drinks. You can afford the hangover, since you can’t
get into the library until noon on Sunday.

It seems that the powers that be who set the library’s hours
think that because we are college students, we -wouldn’t ever
dream of going to the library on a weekend evening or morn-
ing. All we do is party; right, so why should they bother to
open the library?

Because, contrary to popular belief, there are one or two
students on campus who might actually choose to do some
work outside the parameters of the noon-to-dusk schedule
everyone assumes all students keep.

_ I OK, OK, so you’re going to the library on Saturdayvany— '
way? Good luck! If you have need of anything on microfilm,

you may find yourself very frustrated in the first three hours
of looking for the reel you need. Chances are, the one reel of
film you need is probablyithe only one that Hillman doesn’t
have, or has recently misplaced.

If you need to do a computer-assisted search of articles, you
will find the thousands of dollars worth of computers on the
ground floor to be a very promising resource. But once you
sit down, you may notice that it takes a person with ‘a degree
in rocket scierce or computer engineering to figure out how
to access the wealth of information stored in those little chips.

Next, on to that book you need for some informative quotes
to round out your paper. PittCat might help you figure out

' where you could find that book, or at least direct you to the

proper floor where it is supposed to be. (Note: If you are
looking for an article from a journal, the older issues of the
journals are on the easily-accessible ground floor, while the
newer updated volumes are on the fourth floor. Doesn’t that
make perfect sense?) Anyway, you have found the alleged

‘ location of the book you need, but to your dismay it is

nowhere to be found. Once you hunt down someone who
works in Hillman, you discover that the book you need is the

~ onefsomeone checked out last year and never returned,

despite the library’s continuous threats of paper cuts from
opening their letters.

All this might seem rather amusing, or possibly a bit irritat-
ing. But the worst partiis, Hillman Library is one of the 50
largest universityresearch facilities in the country. That the

— library’s facilities are inaccessible or unavailable is pathetic,

and it is inexcusable. The people who run Hillman need to
remember that, even though it may be a large research library,
it is on this campus to serve students. And in order to do that
it needs to be a lot more user—friendly.

He has discriminating tastes

think the
m o m e n t
as finally

come to take
the small
resurgence of
debate revolv-
ing around

Robert _
Chesnavich grams to say

action pro-

what I think
many people agree with and
don’t want to say publicly. I see
the hate mail already, yet I
maintain that there exists a cer-
tain set of laws which (despite
their fanatical support) must be
done awaylwith.

It is tim‘ ‘to do away with
anti-discrimination laws.

Am I crazy? Well, let’s take a
step back and see.

To begin, we have to under-
stand exactlywhat discrimina-
tion is. To discriminate means,
more or less, to choose. In most
of our daily activities, we dis-
criminate among a varied selec-
tion of options. It is only recent-
ly that this word has also taken
on the loaded definition that we
now know. Interestingly,
Webster’s now reflects this
switch through contradictory
deﬁnitions: “discriminate: lb) to
use good judgment. 2) to make a
difference in treatment or favor
on a basis other than individual
merit.”

Every economic decision is an
exercise in discrimination. If
you didn’t get a job because you
weren7t qualified, your would-
be employer discriminated
against you on the basis of
merit. So you will now say, “But

“ that is job-related! All we are

concerned about are cases? of
discrimination on the basis of
something NOT job-related!” in
which case, I make two claims.
The first claim is that the dif-
ference between what is job-
related and what isn’t-can often
become blurred. A former stu-
dent government president at
CMU claimed that her impeach-
ment was discrimination on the

affirmative .

basis of a handicap that she had.
This handicap, however, pre-
vented her from attending many
meetings, thus cutting into her
performance. Another example
was a job that I worked which
partially discriminated against
both women and whites: 10
points for those of you than can
name the job and why this was a
job-related parameter.

The second claim is more
important: it doesn’t matter
what you discriminate on the
basis of, because all discrimina-
tion is valid.

Think about non—job-related
discrimination. To say this
should not be allowed is to say
that every economic decision
must be made solely on eco-
nomic wisdom. Well, think
about all of the economic deci-
sions you make daily. Are all of
them efficient? Did you have to
buy that bag of chips from 7-11
when you could have bought the '
same ones from Giant Eagle at
half the price? Cou1dn’t you
have walked back to Shadyside
instead of taking the bus?

You might say that in these
cases it is a question of utility
per dollar, so it is based on prod-
uct-related factors, but even that
explanation doesn’t always
work. Have you ever boycotted
a product or an establishment?
Liberals boycotted Domino’s
Pizza because their owner sup-
ported pro-life causes. Did that
have any basis in product merit?
Of course not — it was an
example of individuals taking
advantage of their role as eco-
nornic players, making sure that
their money went to individuals
that they wanted it to go to.

Yet we take the opposite
stance when it comes to anti-
discrimination laws. In this case
we turn right around and say
that if an employer has a job to
give out, that it must satisfy a
mandated set of social goals.
This mentality stiﬂes our incen-
tive to acquire wealth by limit-
ing what goals we can put our
wealth toward.

But what about the person
who now doesn’t have a job?
First, he can apply someplace
else, and since not everyone
“discriminates,” those who
don’t will have the better prod-
uct. Branch Rickey knew this -
he signed Jackie Robinson of
his own free will, and it was his
team that won six pennants.

Second, if he doesn’t get a
job, well, it sounds cold, but so
what? Employment is not a
right. Neither is housing, admis-
sion to private organizations,
health care or any private eco-
nomic or social commodity. Put
simply, no one has the right to
someone else’s resources. I do
think that people who judge
people on superﬁcial factors as
opposed to personal worthiness
are morons. We cannot, howev-
er, legislate social harmony, and
we must not try to use someone
else’s resources to achieve it.

Remember one more thing
here: this can be turned around.
Non-rninorities can be discrimi-
nated against, and in fact, the
satne goals that anti-discrimina-
tion laws seek to achieve are
achieved by another form of dis-
crimination: yes, affirmative
action. There’s the irony: under
a system of legalized discrimi-
nation, affirmative action is
completely allowable. So those
who feel that blacks need an
economic push can give it open-
ly and fairly — that is their
right. Those who don’t are free
to do as they please, which is
also their right.

I’m not the only one who

believes this: the Libertarians, p

the third largest political party,
follow the same line, and yes,
there are minority Libertarians
(I’m one of them). So before
sending me letter bombs, do me
one favor — think about this
ﬁrst. Then tell me I’m crazy.

is I for last Iwo games

By Brad Isles
Sports Editor

When itlooked like things couldn’t get any worse for the Pitt
football team, they did yesterday.

Head coach Johnny Majors announced quarterback Pete

to Rutgers. Gonzalez started the last two games, replacing
fifth-year senior John Ryan. I

not be required. -

In the two games he started, Gonzalez completed 22 of 56
attempts for 358 yards and one touchdown. He also threw five
interceptions. Gonzalez added 24 yards and one touchdown on
the ground.

In his first start against Miami in the Homecoming game,
Gonzalez completed 4-20 for 100 yards. Prior to starting the
last two games, he replaced Ryan in four other games this sea-
son going eight of 20 for 120 yards.

“This is very disappointing, as all injuries are, especially at
this time of the year to someone who has made positive contri-
butions to the team,” said Majors in a press release. “He made
very good progress in his last two games, and he was looking
forward to finishing out the season as our starting quarter-
back.” '

Last year Gonzalez appeared in the Virginia Tech game, com-
pleting four of six attempts for 53 yards and one interception.

New XC coach brings
winning ways to Pitt

By David Perkins
For The Pitt News

David Sobal has been involved with
running since high school. Fifteen
years ago he became a track coach and

now he brings a wealth of experience
to the University of Pittsburgh as Pitt’s

new assistant track coach and cross
c untry coach for the men’s and
women’s teams.

‘Sobal, 43, moved to Pittsburgh in
August of this year with his wife and
daughter from Williamsburg, Va.,
where they lived for 18 years. For the

-last six years he coached track in

Williamsburg at a small Division III
Christopher-Newport
University. '

The program at Christopher-
Newport is the -No. 1 women’s

Pittsburgh had to be “a positive step”
for his family. They intend to stay in
Pittsburgh for a while.

“I feel a tremendous amount of com-
mitrnent to the athletes,” Sobal said. .

Sobal said two things important to
the success of the athletes are consis-
tency in training and consistently in
coaching. -

He may have made the right deci-

‘ sion by coming to Pitt because of the
‘ stature of the ‘Big East Conference.
' Lewis told Sobal that in middle dis-

tance anddistance running, the Big
East is the most competitive confer-
ence in the world. As for the women’s
teams, three of the top ﬁve teams in the
current national rankings are from the
Big East.

Sobal never intended to make coach-
ing a career. He_was a biology major in

Watch ESPN via

the Internet

By Stephen Flinn

Staff Writer

Editor’s Note: This is the second of a two-part series
about sports on the Internet.

Sports on the Internet is an excellent example of
combining the sports video game rage of the last
decade with the information-driven society now
emerging. Sports junkies who at one time locked
themselvesin their rooms to play video basketball or
football are now found spending their time keeping up
with the latest on the Internet, a real-life, real-time
computer pastime.

Now that you have worked your way up through the
Internet minor leagues, you should be ready to tackle
the Internet head on. The only way to get good at
maneuvering your way through the Internet is to do
just that.

One of the heavy hitters involved in sports infom_1a-
tion for the last decade has been the television network
ESPN. Therefore, it should be no surprise that ESPN is
one of the frontrunners in providing sports information
on the Internet as well.

Travelling to ESPN-land on the Internet is as easy as
1-2-3. If you did not read the last article on Web orien-
tation, you may want to browse through it so the
instructions do not ﬂy over your head. .

The Web address on Netscape is: http://espnet.sport—
szone.com/

Once you have entered ESPN-land, you will be met
by a plethora of choices ranging from the latest sports
headlines and pertinent statistics to fantasy football

information and information regarding more obscure

sports such as bowling and chess.

Another biggie in the sports information ﬁeld, but in
print media rather than broadcast media, is Sports
Illustrated. So, once again, another ﬁne example of a
sports-Intemet provider is an entity already solidly
enshrined in the sports infonnation world.

The Pitt News, Thursday, November 2, 1995

Column . ‘

°From page 7
ﬁve in ﬁnal voting: Kiiana Carter (2) and Kerry Collins (5). This year
the Buckeyes have a shot at the Rose Bowl and three Heisman ﬁnishers.

Eddie George may be the best back in the country. This 6—foot-3, 220-
pound tailback is averaging 137 yards per game and has scored 16 times;
all in an offense with a huge passing game.

That huge passing game rides on the arm of Bobby Hoying. So far in
‘95 Hoying has thrown for 2,138 yards and 21 touchdowns, 14 to split
end Terry Glenn.

Glenn is by far the best receiver in the country. He has caught 45 pass--
es in eight games, averaging almost 130 yards per contest Ohio State
has played the toughest schedule in college football, and if they beat
Michigan, watch out for the Buckeyes’ Big Three.

' Others on the Heisman bubble are: Tennessee QB Peyton Manning,
. Nebraska QB Tommie Frazier, Southern Cal WR Keyshawn Johnson,
Penn State WR Bobby Engram and South Carolina QB Steve Taneyhill.

 

Matt Grove is a columnist for The Pitt News and is pretty sure John
Ryan won’t win the Heisman.

Jusu s  ros     
Gilman St.. The Big Apple. Limberger and otheragitators! 

lt’s 2 p.m. You’re on a tourist
beach boardwalk somewhere in
Massachusetts that is famous as
a past vacation spot for JFK. You
only woke up 15 minutes ago, and
the pain being inflicted on your
' eyes from the sun has you feeling
like you must be a descendent
from a long lost vampire race. You
haven’t showered or bathed in two
weeks, and you stink like cheap
beer. stale cigarettes and old
underwear. Two cops put you up

' against a wall and tell you that

they’re going to arrest you
because your bracelets are too
spiky. Welcome to Anti-Flag’s The
States are Burning Summer Tour
1995. _

The Tour: First Stop, Cincinnati,
_ Ohio

While I could hardly cover the

events and shows of the entire
tour, this is an account of my
favorite shows and a couple of
interesting items that happened

along the way.
Anti-Flag, consisting of Pat
Thetic (drums), Andy Flag

-. (basslvocals), myself (a.k.a. Justin

Sane, guitar/vocals) and our trusty
and seasoned roadie Anne ‘‘I can
handle anything” Flag, left
Pittsburgh on July 24 to play in
Cincinnati, the first show of 35
confirmed dates. Anti-Flag had
been together now for a little over
three years. and this was to be
our first major U.S. tour after tour-
ing the Midwest and West and
East Coast in short spurts over
the last year.

If you’ve never thought of
Cincinnati as being a hot spot for
excitement, I’m sorry to say that
you weren’t too far off the mark.
Cincinnati is very much like
Pittsburgh. It has a couple of col-
leges, a football team and a base-
ball team. Give them a hockey
team and it’s even. -

On the other hand, the punk
scene in Cincy is something

punk rock scene.

Things started off on the right
foot as we were greeted almost as
soon as we poured out of our van
by a punk rocker named
Limberger. Limberger is a punk
rock phenomenon all his own. He
roadied for a number of famous
European and American punk
bands and made his rise into punk
rock fame by founding and editing
“Scum,” a punk rock fanzine out of
his home state of Florida. While
Limberger openly admits that he
has a questionable past which
includes alcoholism, drug abuse,
small time theft/con artistry and
served prison time among other
things, he is as good a source of
entertainment as anyone else.
And because he has been a con-
stant fan, following us from show
to show on previous tours, we
never fail to welcome him with
open arms —— and closed noses.
(He is a stinky onel!)

We unloaded our equipment
and listened to Limberger drunk-
enly slur stories of his past adven-
tures on the road to us for some
time as we waited to play. On this
night, two power-packed, punker-
than-thou local bands, Bloody
Discharge and Tug Boat, opened

«for us. Things seemed to be
rolling along just fine as the crowd
of 100 or so happily banged into
each other and drank excessive
amounts of alcohol. I was anxious
to get on stage as I felt like this
night would give us a good taste
of how the tour was going to go.
Luckily, I was wrong.

About five minutes before we
opened our set, a large group of
skinheadsventered the show.
These were not racist skinheads,
but nationalistic oneswho are just
as bad. They were simply there to
create trouble, and more or less
they did. Our, set nearly degener-
ated into a riot with drunk skin-
heads taking shots at defenseless

“ people in the crowd.

entirely different. Like Pittsburgh, .

the Cincinnati scene is small but
ripe with talent focused very much
on 1977-type punk. Also like
Pittsburgh, Cincy’s punk scene is
not immediately recognized by the
local mainstream or alternative
press, even though it is nationally
acclaimed in underground alterna-
tive media. Even MTV, the under-
ground icon of hate, is awake

. enough to realize that something

is going on in Cincy. Not too long

‘ ago, MTV did a piece on Cincy’s

Even though m survival
instincts screamed otherwise, I felt
it necessary to verbally attack
them for such pathetic and cliche’
behavior. Surprisingly, after a
short spurt of incredibly uninte//ec-
tual resistance, they actually did
mellow out. But unfortunately the
damage had been done, and the
spirit of unity and energy had left
the crowd. On the other hand, I
did get the feeling that a lot of
punks in Cincinnati learned a
great deal about letting an outside
force come into their scene and
cause problems. Next time, I think
maybe they’ll be ready.

Punx In The Big Apple

Fortunately, things got better.
After finishing the week out with a
good show in Washington, we
headed up north for the next leg of
the tour in the Northeast/New
England area, which has a very
good following for Pittsburgh
bands.

By far one of the best shows of
the tour came in New York City,
where we played at the infamous
ABC No Rio. Headlining this night
was Pittsburgh’s heavy hitters,
SubMachine. Opening before us
were two New York bands and an
all—attitude-no-Green-Day—type-
whining band from Boise, Idaho,
named The Adversives. ABC was
packed, and as midnight
approached, I was happy to get

We were not disappointed by
the crowd’s response to our set.
There was a great feeling of ener-
gy and excitement in the air. We
shared our mikes with a number
of lively kids who succeeded in
spitting all over me as they happily
tried to sing along. Not only that,

‘but their colliding bodies (which by

this timethad poured over onto the

I've never had quite so much fun

SubMachine played, I felt like it
was lucky that the place wasn’t

Saxman James Moody once
told me that music should make
you think. Not just the boom—boom
pounding that Snoop spins from
his urban soul, but the focused.
demanding music that jazz is to
the mind. Jazz demands a new
mentality from its listeners and an
intensity of thought that brings
together all the symbols of bop.
You can't listen to Branford
Marsalis without hearing Charlie
Parker and Louis Armstrong. Jazz
today brings with it 100 years of
American heritage. From work
songs to hard—bopping Lee
Morgan to the liturgical messages
of Sonny Rollins, jazz signifies
America. More than just the
mutated jazz/r&b of high school
crooners Boyz II Men, jazz is a
straight-on lesson in life — with no
chaser.

This Saturday, the past, present’

and future of jazz will be giving a
lesson in Pittsburgh for the 25th
time. This is the 25th year of the

annual jazz seminar and concert
at Pitt and as many have noted,
there are some familiar names.
Don't be discouraged though,
these are the best in the business
and are worth seeing more than
once. For those that haven't been.
this is a great opportunity to meet
and hear the best jazz musicians
in the world. Most of the players
will be giving seminars on Friday
or Saturday. These musician-
scholars will be talking about jazz,
music in America and everything
else under the sun.

Now, here's an interesting story.
How many students of Nathan
Davis knew that he was in Flay
Charles’ band or that he gigged
with Art Blakey? Not only does
Davis know the history of jazz bet-
ter than anyone else, he is part of
that history. Just to see their
teacher play is reason enough for
Pitt students to go to the concert
and seminars. Moreover, we all
get to see what a badass Davis is

on the saxophone. Believe me, he
is a badass. He plays well enough
to make most professional sax-
players want to give up music and
resort to a life of misanthropy. in
addition to Davis’ spellbinding
playing, there are seven other
musicians of equal badittude.

On trumpet, we have John
Faddis and Randy Brecker. Both
players have long jazz histories.
Randy Brecker is famous for his
albums with brother and saxo-
phonist Michael. Together they
have had an extensive recording
career beginning with with their
first album, Back to Back, which
also featured David Sanborn.
Previous to that, Flandy and
Michael were members of Blood,
Sweat and Tears’ horn section.
Randy's seminar is Friday, 10:30-
11:30 a.m.

John Faddis, with enough tech-
nique and high notes for 10 play-
ers, has had an equally successful
career. He has several solo

godlike skills. He has also record-
ed with Latin piano king Michelle
Camille and toured with the
Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra.
Hear Faddis speak 11 a.m.-noon
on Saturday.

Grover Washington Jr. leads
the saxophone section playing
soprano, alto and tenor saxes. He
is one of the smoothest and slick-
est players around. In addition to
hisjmany albums and accolades,
Washington also teaches in his
town of Philadelphia. His seminar
is always good. Friday 1-2:30 p.m.

James Moody (tenor, alto,
soprano sax and flute) is what you
would call an intellectual musician
— a musician’s musician. He
picks and chooses his notes to
create a pattern of melodies pretty
enough to make a grown man cry.
To hear the Moody manifesto on
jazz, his seminar is at 3 p.m. on
Friday.

Psychic Friend

New York was followed up by a
number of equally good shows in
New England. As. we made ready
to head into the South, my friend
Karin read my horoscope to me in
a Boston coffee shop. It read:
“This will be a time" of amazing
highs and abysmal lows, with little
in-between. You’re advised to
steer clear of extremes and stay
away from people who upset your
equilibrium.” While I had my suspi-
cions, I had no idea how right my
psychic friend would turn out to
be.

I have never gone through so
many extreme highs and lows in
all of my life! One minute I was
ready to jump off a 20—story build-
ing, and the next I was ready to
throw someone else off a 20-story
building. After touring for seven
weeks, my belief is that touring is

 

100 percent psychological. While
‘taking the advice of a cheap
Boston tabloid horoscope may
seem incredibly ridiculous (and it
is), i had never received better
touring advice in all my life.

Home of the King

The South was very interesting.
Many of the punk scenes were
small, but as a result, many of
them were very close knit and
very friendly. We hooked up with
The Adversives again in Nashville,
where we were booked at Lucy’s,
a record store that has shows
every other weekend.

Somehow, I don’t think that
Nashville was ready for Anti4Flag
(or at least this crowd wasn’t).
Noticing that a large number of
kids were sporting MTV punk
band shirts such as Green Day,
Offspring, Bad Religion, Rancid,
etc., we couldn’t help but have a
little fun. We proceeded to poke
fun at Rancid and a number of
other equally sold-out bands, all in
good Anti-Flag fun of course.
Unfortunately, our humor was not
at all well received. Before we
even played our first song, i think
half of the crowd had already left!
It was amazing! I had never seen
anything like it before, or since. I
guess Nashville lost its sense of
humor with the Civil War.

 

bass player Andy Flag narrowly
escaped an involuntary hair cut
offered to him by some Southern
good ol’ boys. It seems as if they
had a some kind of a problem with
his sparkling silver mohawk. I
believe that they made some ref-
erence to Satan or something, but
Andy wasn’t sticking around long
enough to find out.

Don't Forget The Alamo

On the other hand, El Paso,
Texas, was a breathe of fresh air.
Definitely one of the best shows of
the tour, we were placed on a
power packed full blow out bill
with our friends The Queers from
Portsmouth, New Hampshire, and
Tilt from northern California. This
crowd was nothing like Nashville
in any way, shape or form, and I'm
happy to say that our humor was
much better embraced on this
night. .

Definitely more of a power_pop
punk scene, to our surprise, our
more abrasive style of fast political
punk went over great!

The kids in El Paso were mostly
very young and very friendly. The
promoter of this show was only
16, and he had to ask his parents
permission to let us stay at his
house. Pretty young for a guy
who, with only the support of his

 

To top it off, aftr the show our

  

friends, pulled off a show with a
crowd of 250 plus without a hitch.

El Paso was a great example of
small-scene punk rock at its best.
The kids worked with and relied
solely on each other. They did
things their way and made no
compromises. They were fair to
the bands and treated each other
with respect and caring. The end
result was a great show, a scene
that strives to be and is a social
force, and a lot of fun.

Unfortunately for us, there was
one problem — a place to stay.
When you think about touring
bands, what do you think of? Out
of control parties in hotel rooms
where nothing is left standing?
Long nights of drinking the best
champagne in luxurious hotel
suites? Room service? Well, save
those ideas for your next viewing
of a Bon Jovi tour documentary —
this is punk rock, tough guy!

The reality is that most bands
either drive all night to get to their
next gig or they stay with the pro-
moter of the show. In this case,
the promoter of the show was 16,
and being 16 has its drawbacks
(i.e. parents). You see while it was
at one time OK for Anti-Flag to
stay with our 16-year-old promoter
buddy, his Ma and Pa suddenly
had a change of heart. Bastardsll

year—old promoter friend told us,
"you can stay with my friends at
their house. You don’t mind
sneaking in through a window do
you?”

Yep, that's right! Next thing I
know Anne Flag, Pat Thetic, Andy
Flag and l are all following a group
of young teenage grrrls through
one of their bedroom windows.
“lt’s OK," one of them explained.
“my parents have never caught us
before.” The night ends with us
reading issues of Seventeen and
YM and discussing bulemia,
anorexia (two topics which are
impossible to avoid when reading
such magazines) and whether or
not we like Danzig or Rollins
more. Personally, I don’t like
either of them.

-anit-flag from 6 ‘
of), identity and sound after tour-
ing the West Coast. Quite the con-
trary to the East Coast, where
political bands reign, 1977-style
anarchist punk is god, t_he rain
never stops and the weather is
freezing half of the year. (Maybe
there is some correlation in there
between the weather and people's
attitudes? Hmm ...?)

Our best show on the West
Coast was easily at the now
famous 924 Gilman St. in
Berkeley, Calif., home to the likes

' of NOFX. The Swiggin’ Utters,

Operation Ivy, Crimp Shrine,
Green Day, Rancid, etc. ’
924 Gilman St. is world-famous
as a self-organized, seIf-main-
tained, non-profit punk rock collec-
tive. Covering all definite issues
important to punk rock, Gilman St.
has strict guidelines stating that
no bands supporting sexist, racist,
fascist, violent, homophobic or

. capitalist ideals are permitted to

play. (That includes all major label
bands, or bands supported by cor-
porate sponsors such as MTV.
That’s right, kiddies, no more
Rancid shows at Gilman St. How
sad.)- 5 _

On this particular night, we were
booked on a sold-out bill featuring
local favorites A.F.l. Gilman St.
-was more than impressive; it was
almost unbelievable. While I do

the idea of freedom of expression
concerning Gilman St.’s strict
guidelines, I have to admit that
Gilman St. is the epitome of
underground punk rock. The orga-
nization is incredible, the atmos-
phere of acceptance and com-
monality in goals is definite. All
problems are dealt with swiftly and
non-violently. Everyone istreated
equally. '

Three local bands opened up
for us before we hit the stage in
the fourth slot, one before A.F.l.
While it was obvious that we were

in theheartland of power pop 

punk and we were a little ‘more
than this crowd of 500 plus was
expecting, they were very recep-
tive of us. In the end we left
Berkeley with a new attitude about
the possibilities of DIY (Do It
Yourself) punk. It’s what you’re
willing to put into it, and that's all
there is to it. ‘

Losing My Grip,
It never stopped raining in

_Seattle from the time we got there

till the time we left. Not only did
Pat Thetic and I both catch colds
that would stay with us till’ the end
of the tour, -but we got ripped off
and lied to by the club where we
played. More than that, Seattle
has noipunk scene. You're either
into grunge or you just don’t live in
Seattle. Not that Seattle was terri-

ble or anything, I don’t want you to
get the wrong idea. I did like con-
templating the notion that maybe I
was sitting on the same toilet seat
as Kurt Cobain, or that I might run
into Soundgarden (preferably with
the van). But as the final leg of the
tour approached, I was reaching
the end of my rope and desper-
ately needed something to pick
me up.

Enter Reno, Nevada! Fifteen
hours later we were banging on
slot machines and dice tables and
happy to be doing it. Pat and I
were happy to blow more of Anne
Flag’s winnings than she could
count, as he and I had an incredi-
ble knack for losing. On the other
hand, she had an incredible knack
for winning! (We must've been
good luck for her.)

Reno has become a favorite for
Anti-Flag. Since first visiting Reno
last spring, I have had many fond
daydreams oi gaudy casinos and
blinding neon lights. There is defi-
nitely a wonderful trashiness
about Reno, although I can't quite
put my finger on it. Maybe it’s the
drunken old people who talk to the

- quarter slots, or the filth of money

that you can almost feel floating
through the air, or the fact that you
can’t tell whether it's night or day
because of the flashing neon
signs. Honestly, I get the feeling
that it’s probably a combination of

everything. But I am absolutely
positive that Reno is a diamond in
the ruff.

The first time we played in Reno
was with The Queers on our previ-
ous West Coast tour in the spring
of ‘95. It was most definitely -a full-
blown punk rock extravaganza!
With that memory fresh in my
mind, I was excited about tonight’s
bill, which showed equal promise,
featuring us with New Jersey’s
Bouncing Souls and Berkeley's
Screw 32.

Reno’s punk rock guru, Pete
Risnowski, better known in the
punk underground as “The Sticker
Guy,” had booked tonight’s show
and was calling the shots. It
seems like Pete has been calling
the shots in Reno from day one,
when he single-handedly put
Reno on the punk rock map. That
goal he achieved through his self-
promoted, self—run, D.l.Y., sticker
production company, which has

(produced stickers for plenty o’

famous punk bands. As time went
on, he began using his connec-
tions to draw bands into the punk
rockless Reno, and before he
knew what had happened, Reno’s
punk scene was thriving! It
seemed like every band wanted to
play there. Now it is an up and
coming mecca for punk rock.

This night would live up to that
description, as the crowd of

7

approximately 250-300 kids lit up
with enthusiasm that never
seemed to falter from the first to
last chord of three power-packed
sets. I’m not sure which I enjoyed-
more — playing ‘‘I don’t want to be
like you” covered in bodies, or
singing along with an electrified
crowd to Bouncing Souls’,
“Johnny X.” Either way, Reno-still
reigns number one in my punk
rock diary.

 

Finally Back in Pittsburgh ‘n’at.
After a dozen or more shows in

-a number of towns with very

impressive scenes,-including
Denver, ‘ Salt Lake City,
Minneapolis, Chicago (where we
played in a bowling alley) and

Lexington, we made the last ‘

exhausting drive back to
Pittsburghon Sept. 2, approxi-
mately seven weeks and 41 long
and tiring days after our first show
in Cincinnati. Personally, I never
thought that I could be so happy
to be stuck in a town which before
now I had continuously referredto
as hell. But believe me, I was
happy to be home.
