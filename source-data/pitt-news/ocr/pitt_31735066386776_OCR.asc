Hold on
investing
in South
Africa,
SGB says

By Matt Groff
Asst. News Editor

The Student Government
Board has decided to recom-
mend against Pitt’s possible
reinvestment in South Africa.

According to a letter sent to
the Pitt’s Committee to Consider
Reinvestment in South Africa,
the SGB stated it isagainst rein-
vestment until elections have
been held in April.

“It appears this country is still

violent and unstable,” SGB pres-l

ide-nt Ross Pasquale said.
“Things can change very rapidly
[in South Africa] and I’m not

' confident with taking a chance

that anything would be stable in
such a country.”

Pasquale stressedthat he was
speaking personally, and not for
the SGB as a group, but said the
board had reached the decision
as a group.

-“We came across volumes
and volumes of information,”
said Pasquale. I

“There just doesn’t seem to
be any guarantee of stability in
South Africa,” he said.

According to a university
“South African Proposal” in
1985, Pitt divested “all university
funds invested in corporations
involved‘ with the Republic of
Soutlr,Africa.”

An SGB resolution at that time
supported Pitt’s divestment in
order to weaken the South
African government and its poli-
cy of ‘apartheid. ,

While reviewing the issue, the
board solicited responses from
student groups with a direct
interest in reinvestment, such as
the Black Action Society and
Students for a Free South Africa.

Twenty—two students gath-

dent of Women Exploited by

from a personal standpoint on
Post—Abortion Syndrome, the
depression that sometimes fol-
lows an abortion, according to
Shaw. ' .
Shaw, who attended UCLA in
the late—1970s told Students For
Life about her experiences with
three crisis pr‘egn;1ncies\antl the
abortions that resulted from
two. ‘ ‘

She compared the depression
felt after an abortion to the
post-traumatic stress associated
with Vietnam veterans.

In Shaw’s newsletter,
C'ol/egians lost. she said that
she first chose to abort her

' pregnancy because she didn’t

want to deal with the stress and
demands of a pregnancy_ and a
new life. “I couldn’t have been

Pin‘ recycling program improves bat questions still remain

By Scott Carpel
Staff Writer '

Paper, newspaper, corrugated
paper, lrigh-grade office paper,
aluminum, compost  These
are all words which may be
familiar to many people at this
university and may never be to
some. ‘

These are all words which
have to- do with school. Well,
they all have to do with recy-

‘ cling at Pitt. It is something that

students. living on and off cam-

pus, are expected to be
involved with, and unlike class-

es, it does not require hours of-

homework.

Students and employees, as
members of the university com-
munity, are part of this recycling
program and can help deter-
mine its success.

Sophomore Christine Loos
said, “The university’s recycling
program is pretty good. They
are showing-a good effort and
make it accessible for the stu-
dents.” '

1990, the

Beginning in.

‘University of Pittsburgh was

required to recycle according to
State Act 101 of the
Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Resources,
Bureau of Waste Management.

According to this act, recy— _

cling is the collection, separa-
tion, recovery and sale or reuse
of metal, glass, paper, leaf
waste, plastics and other materi-
als which would otherwise be
disposed or processed as
municipal waste.

It also involves the creation
and recovery of reusable materi-
als other than fuel for the opera-

tion of energy.

However,
of Pittsburgh is only required
to recycle certain items like

paper and aluminum, not news-

papers, plastic containers or
glass. ,
The reason for this, according
to Gil Schaffer of the Housing
Department, is that under this
act the university falls under the
category of a state invititution

the University‘ _Maribeth

Therefore, it is not required to
recycle the other items until the
state makes it mandatory.

At this time: according to
Rizuttol of the
Recycling Division of
Pittsburgh, there are no plans to
do this.

The university’s recycling is
divided into two groups.

The first half is housing,
which includes all _six residence
halls in Schenley Quadrangle,

SEAC reaches agreement onmining issue  

By Robin Senor
Staff Writer

After 11 hours of protesting
the proposed mining of Wayne
National Forest in Ohio, mem-
bers of the Student
Enviromental Action Coalition
and activists from Ohio rea_ched
an agreement with Office of
Surface Mining in Washington,
D.C., last Tuesday night.

“We went in and said 
won’t compromise our public
lands — and we went out of

‘there very happy with the

results,”’ SEAC member Matt
Peters said.
The agreement came after the

 

protesters locked themselves
inside the OSM’s regional
branch in Greensburg last
Mondayin an effort to speak
with someone. P

. “At about 9:30 Joe Hazelbaker V

began a dialogue with Nancy
Garrett, the representative from
Washington, D.C. It was on a
speaker phone, so he could
reflectthe consensus of the
whole group,” Peters said. Joe
Hazelbaker is the director of the
Buckeye Forest Council.

Peters said that the most
important issue to SEAC was the
way the matter was handled. -

“Carl Close, the director of the
Eastern Regional Office, han-

dled the situation very profes-
siona-lly. That is what you’re
supposed to do when some-
bodycomes and sits down in

‘your office —— speak with-

them," Peters said,
According to a document pro-
vided by SEAC, the agreements

generally concern a. ruling‘
included in the 1977 Surface

Mining Control and Reclamation
Act that permits individuals who

own public land to have “valid

existing rights” to that land.
But because that term was left
undefined in the ruling, it is up
-to the OSM to determine who
has “valid existing rights.”
The OSM has now agreed to

have a verified definition of
these rights. P
Thomas Bellville, owner of
Belville Coal in Ironton, Ohio,
was originally denied “Valid
existing rights” to the portions
of land. he owned in the Wayne
National Forest, but
he appealed the decision

«and won in ‘an Ohio Appeals

Court, according to the docu-
ment. P 7

The agreement also includes
a meeting between the Ohio.
Enviromental‘ Protection
Agency, ’ Division of

Reclamation and activist organi-‘
zationsvto discuss the Bellville 7

Permit.

Sc/aenley Cafe changes
/yours to save money

By David Gist
For The Pitt News

The Schenley Cafe food court
now closes at 8:30 p.m. because
students aren’t eating there after
this time and the university was
losing money because of its‘ old
closing time of 11:50 p.m.,

8 according to Manager Gregory
.\ Smith. I

Director of Food Services
Betsy Sallade Farina said the
Schenley Cafe was losing about
$1,000 to $1,800 ‘a week
because no’ one was eating after
8:50 p.m. and ‘therefore money
was wasted payingiworkers to V.

' operate the facilities.

Student Mike Jones disagreed

with the new hours.

Jones said he takes night
classes that end at 8:10 p.m.,
so if he wanted to eat at the

cafe he would not be able to do

so.
On the other hand, student
Chris Barnett said the

new hours doesn’t trouble him I

at all because he doesn’t use
cash. E v

He said he uses his meal plan
which only can be used until 7

' p.m.

Farina added that until the
university does more promo-
tional work to promote its
late hours,‘ the Schenley Cafe
food court will still close at 8:30
p.m. j  ‘

Through a Christian post-

I abortion counseling group,

Shaw says she was able to
heal.

“In post-abortion recovery‘

the aim is really life after
death,” she said.
But the recovery process is

not only for women who

have been through an abor-

tion, Shaw said. “I can’t just i

say women, [because] both
women and men are impact-
ed. Parents of a child contin—
ue to walk aroundwith that
child for a number of rea-
sons.” - C

When she was dealing with
her decisionon whether to

become pregnant

keep her child or to abort,
Shaw said that the only voices
talking about abortion at the
time were pro-abortion voic-
es. “Ten years ago, post-abor-
tion was a new thing.”

Shaw said it takes time
before women who have had
abortions are ready to
again.
“When you opt for an abor-
tion experience, part ofthe

things that are said to us is ’

that you’re just holding back.
You’re just saving it for the
appropriate time, that there is
no coming back.”

Noting that trying to pre-
vent abortions is important to
her, Shaw said the recovery

process for thosewho have
had abortions is just as impor-
tant.

Shaw said that women who
are pro-choice and say “I’ve

had an abortion and"I"m glad

I’ve done that,” are saying
that partly because of denial.
She said the counseling
women receive tends to stress
that it was not a baby, but
simply a structure of ‘tissues.
According to Shaw, the

abortion process does not just

stop with the baby, but goes
on to affect the mother,‘ the
father, any siblings, and if the
parents split up, the abortion
goes on to affect potential
mates for the parents.

recycling in 1990, the totals
were low.

According to Robert Boyce,
senior facility manager —of
Facilities Management, they
reported 83,000 pounds of card-
board and paper and 1,000
pounds of aluminum cans.

By 1992, totals ha_d increased
to 686,290 pounds of cardboard
and paper, 8,785 pounds of alu-
minum cans and included 150
cubic yards of compost.

Up until the end of October
1993, Facilities Management has
reported 532,750 poundsof
paper and 4,032 pounds of alu-
minum cans.

The administration has no

‘strict fines or punishments for

recycling violations.
Comparably, the City of

Pittsburgh can institute fines ‘

up to $5,000 for individuals who
do not comply with recycling
laws. ‘ ‘ ,

Betty Duffet, housekeeping
supervisor at Sutherland Hall,
said, “We have no jurisdiction to
force students [to recycle]

At Pitt, it all depends on the
students and ‘faculty. Many stu-
dents living in residence halls
said they usually recycle.

First—year student Leslie
Brown, who lives in Tower B,
said she and about half of the
people on her ﬂoor do recycle.
She mostly recycles aluminum
cans, and said she is concerned
with the use of Styrofoam inlthe
cafeterias of ‘Lothrop Hall and

j the Towers. ' .

Loos, who lives in Bruce Hall,

also recycles aluminum cans;_

Coming from nearby Pittsburgh,
she retains glass and takes it
home with her to recycle. 9
Kimberly Kertis, a resident of
Tower B, said she recycles at
home and is not happy with the
university’s system. ‘
‘ “I never see it going on. I see
a lot of it going in the garbage,”
Kertis said. “There might be
receptacles in the trash room,
but the doors lock at 4 p.m.,
and I don’t finish class until
then.” A
“Of all recyclables, aluminum
cans seems to. be the best. The
kids tend to mix the papers and
treat them like trash,” said Jack
Packard, housekeeping supervi-
sor for. Schenley Quadrangle.
“They don’t realize it or don’t
take the time.” I
Similarly at Sutherland Hall,
Duffy said, “We have a very
good response with cans, but
paper is questionable."
According to Schaffer, resi-
dent assistants are involved with
recycling.
“There are also other groups
that get behind recycling a lot,”
he said. '_ I _ '
« ‘‘We’re always trying to
update the plan and tiy to get
paperwork‘ out to [students].
Some ﬂoors do notrecycle, and
there are others that go at it very
strongly,” Schaffer said.
. The problem with waste does
not only come from students‘,

‘Schaffer said. Waste is also

found in the recycling-bins
which are collected from

g.

offices.

“When we see a problem 9

area, we will pass out notices
and tell [students and staff mem-
bers] what they have to recycle,”
said Packard.

Recyclables are collected at
least twice a week at the build-
ings under Facilities
Management, and the schedule
is similar for_the buildings under

I. the Housing Department. 2

Aluminum can holders are

‘provided on each floor in the

‘residence halls and in the laun-
dry room of the‘Towers lobby.
Other receptacles are located in
the lobbies of other dorms.
Paper receptacles are located
throughout other university
buildings and in computer labs.
In offices, each desk is
equippedwith side—by recepta-
cles for paper.

Receptacles are collected and ~

brought to large bins where
they await pickup. Housing col-
lects its recyclables under
Schenley Quadrangle using
three separate bins. I

Facility Management collects
its recyclables at the loading
docks outside Benedum Hall. In

both casesprivate contracted .'

There will be penalties for
people in violation of this law.

Students living off campus
should also be advised that no

‘ According to Boyce, the
amount of money given for
recycled cans all depends on
the market for aluminum. The‘

A UNL staff member said that the uni- ‘

is unfair to smokers.

The staff member. a former chair of the
activist group Smokers _Against the
New Smoking Policy, said the ban on
smoking in and immediately around
campus buildings is unfair because state
cigarette taxes are used to pay for some
buildings and imaintenance at UNL‘s
main campus.’ ‘T

UNL students are also divided over the
issue, according to their campus newspa-
per. Smokers have complained that the
ban ‘requires them to be segregated from
other students, while non-smoking’ stu-

9 dents feel private smokers‘ areas would

be fair to those who do not want to smell
smoke.

Rewor/e the recycling program
In 1990, State Act 101 required the University, of
Pittsburgh to recycle certain items like paper and alu-
minum, but not newspapers, plastic or glass.
According to Gil Schaeffer of the housing department,
the university falls into the category of a state institu-

- tion and thus is excluded from recycling certain things.

There are two groups who participate in university
recycling: housing and the other buildings which
house classrooms, labs and offices.

Housing includes all the residence halls and the-

Health Center. L
The housing part also includes fraternities, but they
are not required to participate in recycling programs.

However, they often collect and recycle aluminum .

cans as a fundraiser. .

Under citycode, students that live off campus must
also recycle. They should ‘recycle things such as bot-
tles, newspapers, glassjars and metal cans. V

There are fines for people who don’t recycle under
city code, but there is no way to enforce on-campus
recycling. ‘Although the totals for on-campus recycling

‘have been rising, they are much lower than they

should be. p .

-The .nation’snatural resources should beprotected‘

through such conservation -lmethods. Recycling is a
necessary measure that anyone can take toward
improving the ecology. ’

At Pitt, recycling is totally dependent on the students _,

and faculty. Although many Pitt students say they recy-

cle, much «of the timeit is only aluminum cans

Although this is a start, students should change their
attitudes toward paper recycling and realize that paper

« can be recycled and not treat paper-recycling cans like
‘ordinary trash cans.

Robert Boyce, senior facility ‘manager of the Office of
Facilities Management, said that he is looking into

recycling newspaper. The Office of _Facilities’

Management is in charge of recycling in all the build-
ings except the residence halls: At this time, housing is
not considering recycling newsprint. i

It is clear that ‘Pitt needs a cohesive recycling policy.
The division leaves students and faculty unclear as to
where to recycle. ‘I I . A

What is needed is an overall system where one con-

sistent, comprehensive recycling program is in place.

In addition to the installation of such a program, the
people on Pitt’s campus need to know what is‘ recy-
clable. . A ‘ l . .

Finally, if changes can be made, a place for off-carn-
pus students to bring recyclables would benefit those
who do not live on campus. _

Until such a program can come into being,students
and faculty should learn what the current system is
and make use of itas much as possible.

Drug War strategy should not be partisan plan

This is in response to Tony

‘ Dickensheets’ column on Jan.
20 about Surgeon General Dr. s

Joyce Elders’ speech on the
legalization of drugs. I have a
problem with the logic of his
argument. . ’

While I do not feel comfort-
able in taking a stand for the
legalization of drugs, consider-
ing the negative impact alcohol
and tobacco have had on our
society, Dickensheets degrades
the intellectual merits of his
argument with partisan postur-
ing and political bashing.

Neophyte Dickensheets must
not be aware thatone of the
long time proponents of the
legalization ofldrugs isgnone
other than the arch-conserva-

tive William- F. Buckley. I have

heard Buckley engage in a

‘number of eloquent debates on e

the insidious, destructive effects
our current drug law's have on
society. -

7 ‘ His argument is that legaliz-

ing drugs is thelesser of two
evils. Dr. Joyce Elders doesn’t
dispute that there would be
many negative effects to legal-

izing drugs. Like Buckley and
other serious intellectuals, she
asks if there is another way to

approach the problem of drugs"
in our society. I suggest that if

anyone really cares about
investigating this problem
deeper, that you reflect on all
the arguments with an open
mind. _DickensheetsT argument
employs familiar
Limbaugh logic and unfortu-
nately lacks any insight into the

' subject.

Personalawareness can't decide who livesor dies

In his baseless attack on Mark and Gretchen

' Nelson, the guest speakers at the Jan. 22 meeting

of Students for Life, Ted Kaplan demonstrates
perfectly the folly oftlpro-’ “choice” thinking.
When referring to a child who was saved when
her mother decided against abortionas a result
of a rescue, Kaplan wrote, “the probability is
very high that the child that

baby’s life is worth living. Kaplan writes that he

has “an awareness of the possible futures await- ‘

ing the children born into this world.” Well, in
this case, his“awareness” was dead wrong. How
many other children who have resulted from
unplanned pregnancies would you have allowed
to be killed before birth, Ted? Beethoven?
Abraham Lincoln? Jesus Christ? V ~

they saved is suffering through L  T T E R S _ Both sides in the abortion
life in a dysfunctional family.” ,_ — debate agree with the famous

If Ted Kaplan had bothered ——-—- % Planned Parenthood slogan ""F.very

her mother is extremely grateful that the rescue
occurred and she allowed her child to live. A
picture of this beautiful child was passed around
during our meeting. - ‘ -

If it were up to Ted Kaplan and other pro-
aboits, this child would be dead because Kaplan

_ are wanted and let’s learn to want
children more.” Pro-aborts, like Ted Kaplan,
believe “Every child a wanted child, so let’s
identify unwanted children before they’re bor/n

“choice” position‘ translates into “Every unwant— ‘

Frats’ images, columnistsideas need improvement

Firstly, with regard to Paul Yeckel’s lettergwhat? The Lambda Chi posters were ordered to be taken
down by the Interfraternity Council, which makes a lot of sense, as frats are considered by many to

be the absolute nadir oflife on earth, and this incident does nothing to improve their image. You

find nothing inappropriate in a picture of a half-naked woman with the slogan “Accept Nothing
Less” printed above? You don’t seevany implication that the poster is saying “join our pondscum frat
and lots of womenywill want to have sex with you?” implying that Pitt is under communist rule is

such a mindblowingly moron-ic statement that I won’t even comment on it. v A '
Secondly, Tony Dickensheets’ pro—drug war rant advocated mandatory death sentences and sen-
tencing for drug dealers. The prisons are already clogged with people sent there by mandatory sen-
tences; the situation has reached the point" where violent criminals are being set free due to lack of
prison space, and some judges are refusing to enforce mandatory sentences. As far as the death
penalty is concerned, in the United States it costs much, much more to kill a prisoner than to house
him or her for life. It's very hypocritical for someone who was recently whining about the excessive
presence of the government in people’s lives to be advocating taking possible drug addicts’ children
away from them and imposing a police state in bad neighborhoods. '

Women's gymnastics loses thirdin a l’OW

 

By Neal Riley
For The Pitt News

The Pitt women’s gymnastics
team lost their third meet of the
season to the University of New
Hampshire on Sunday.

The final team score for New

_Hampshire was 185.4, while

Pitt’s totaled 178.175.

There were some personal
records set by many of the Pitt
women on Sunday. Most out-
standing was Brenda Stevens
who placed third with an all-

around score (total score for all

four events) of 37.15.

However, the overall team
scores did not average well. A
tight lineup gave little margin
for error, and a few low scores
dulled Pitt's competitive edge.

Two of Pitt’s strongest per-

 

formers, Meg Johns and Robyn
Senior, competed despite ill-
nesses.

“We can’t depend on the

same people all the time,” said .

Pitt Coach Debbie Yohman.
“We have to get some more
people in the lineup with big

scores to step in when someone

is having a bad day.
 a whole, I think we had a

good meet,‘ but I think the team‘

results were a little disappoint-
ing. V
Last week Pitt competed

)7

against Temple. Overall, the

team had some really high
scores along with some really
low scores. This week, some of

‘g the low scores came up but

some _of the high scores

a dropped.

Placing second on beam,

ts

Brenda Stevens achieved a
career high, increasing her
score from a 9.0 to a 9.5.
Michelle Cole raised her score
since last meet from an 8.75- to
9.225. Bethany T oellner’s beam
score went from 8.15 to 8.7, and
Lori Buck moved from an 8.7 to
an 8.9. Beam scores from Senior
and Johns dropped since last
meet.

On the floor exercise,

something to first
year Pitt gymnast Robyn
Senior who has been
practicing gymnastics‘ for
as long as she can
remember. T

Those gymnast-jargon‘
phrases denote the twist-
ing, turning, jumping and
jolting of the human body
that make gymnastics one
of the more spectacular
college sports. '

‘ Senior knows all too
well the kind of work that

goes into training for such _

a sport. .

harshly. ‘

But for an athlete like ‘

Senior, devotion to
the sport is just a part of

life. 7

She started gymnastics
with preschool classes
and began competing at
age six’.

She has been compet-
ing ever since.

“She has an _excellent
work ethic, she’s just a
real hard worker,” said
Yohman. A ,

A native Pittsburgher,

Senior attended high,

school at

Avonworth
High. 1

During that time, she V
. competed in club gym-

nastics and found some
time to play a little soccer
and run track on the side.
Of course, gymnastics
came ‘first. Attending
a » small school
allowed her to miss some
practice time in the other
sports.

“They would let things
go because they didn't
have enough people as it
was,” Senior recalled.

Choosing to stay in her
hometown, Senior was
attracted -to Pitt because
of its strong medical and
biology departments.
Based upon this decision,
Yohman recruited her as
a walk-on athlete.

Hockey holds off second

By Tom Schneider
Staff Writer.

The Pitt Hockey Club contin-
ued. its steady upward climb this
past Saturday when they
trounced inter-city rival
Duquesne, 6-2, in a non-league
game at Golden Mile‘ Ice Arena.

The Panthers (9-3-1 overall, 3-
3 in the WPCHA) survived an

A early second—period surge by

Duquesne with aggressive

‘ penalty killing, along with two

power play goals of their own
to extend their non—league
record to 6-0-1.

The win also avenged two
losses to the Ice Dukes last sea-
son,and gives Pitt a definite
psychological boost heading
into next week’s showdown
with WPCI-IA powerhouse

‘ Carnegie Mellon.‘

“The bottom line is that you
have to make short, quick pass-

~ es [to win gamesl,” Panther

head coach Harold Ochs said.
“In order to have a successful

' breakout, you have to keep the

passes short. We had our guys

too high on the point when
lDuquesnel was making their

< run, and the passes were being

intercepted. H

"Once we made an adjust-
ment, we got back in the dri-
ver’s seat."

Six different Panthers scored a
point in Saturday’s victory, with
Pitt defenseman/forward Tony
Trovato leading all scorers with
two goals and an assist. Other

Panther high scorers ’ included

captain Vic Disanti (2 goals),
forward Brad Rizzo (2 assists),
center Bill Elliott and defense-
man Scott Giordano (1 goal, 1
assist each). »

The story in this game was
not only special teams, but team
defense and improved goal-
tendingi F

Panther goalies have not had ‘

to face many shots in the past
few weeks, which was why Dan
Bra.tkovich"s, 26 saves on
Saturday were so crucial to a
Panther victory.

His vital saveon a Duquesne
breakaway early in the second
period set the tone for a stellar

In addition, the Panther
defensive corps proved again
that they have not missed a
beat, and have even improved,
since the first half of the season,
despite losing keystone
defenseman Phil Laux.

Much of the Pantliers’ ability
to keep their intimidating defen-
sive posture is due to the trans-

period rally, downs Duquesne

plantion of winger Steve Fisher,
who made the transition from
forward to defense after the
departure of Iaux.

"Steve Fisher lsplaying a
great defensive game out there.“
Ochs said. '

A "He sets [the

up play]

extremely well. He has a lot of

offensive experience, and that
helps him play defens_e better."
Trovato got the Panthers on

the board early in the first peri—_
od.

He took a pass from Disanti
between the circles and fought
off a defender draped all over
him to slide the puck under
Duquesne’s goaltender, giving
Pitt a 1-0 lead. a
‘ Disanti closed out the first
period ‘scoring a few minutes

Marshall  

Contiriued from page 9
Marshall gave a sneak preview
of what was to come for the rest
of the game. '

Marshall received a pass on
the baseline from point guard
Kevin Ollie, dribbled once and
served a_two-handed facial to
the whole Pitt team — hung on
the rim then turned to the Field
House Fanatics with a big grin
and his arms out like he was

‘saying, “Sorry fellas, it’s going to _

be a long game.” _
“It was a thing to get me,
pumped up,” ‘said Marshall.
“But it was a smile to the fans.
They were getting to us early
and we had to do something to
shut them up early.”
, The Fanatics reacted with
chants of profanities and boos..
Did it bother him?
No. _
. Add some fuel to the fire?"
Most definitely.
Traditionally, Marshall has not
had success in the~Field House,
averaging around nine or 10

' points per game.

“Hevhas not had a history of
playing thatwell against Pitt
liere,” said assistant coach

Howie Dickenmam.

incentive for‘ him to come out
and score 25 points.”

So much for history.

The only history of Marshall is
he is consistently getting better
by the year, game, minute 
and that’s.pretty scary.

As a freshman he averaged '

11.1 points, as a sophomore 17
points. -

This summer he was the MVP
for the Pan-AIM Team, which

consists of twelve of the best?

collegiate, players.-He’s also
UConn’s all—time leading shot-
blocker.

This game he showed why he
is one of colleges finest.

He broke out his fullarsenal
against Pitt. A -

He hit the 15-foot
consistently, two baby hooks, a
couple of turn—around jumpers
and oh yeah, he also dunked
four times. - _

He put the ball on the floor
and took the defender to the
hole or he stopped at a’ drop of
a dime and kissed it off the
glass.

He showedincredible agility
and speed by running the break

THE PITT NEWS‘ Tuesday, Fem 1,1994 . I 13

Senior

Continued from page 10

Although gymnastics ‘does
make it harder to find study
time, this Pitt athlete is used to
making room for the books in a
tight schedule.

These days the women’s gym-
nastics team is spending its time

preparing for their fourth meet I
of the season. With new skills i

already learned and routines
alreadyassigned, the women lift
weights and practice three of
four events every workout. The
practices involve a lot of repeti-
tion in order to perfect the rou-

A , tines.

Senior is one of Pitt’s all-
arounders, which means she
performs all of the events. The
vault, uneven parallel bars, bal-
ance beam and floor exercise
are a part of her everyday life.
What is her favorite event?‘The
vault.

“it really scares me,” said
Senior. ‘

“When I looked at her coming
in as an all—arounder,. I thought
she was a real nice beam work-

ler  but right now she’s our

top vaulter,"‘ said Yohman.

. Senior admits that college g

gymnastics is much different
from club gymnastics,lbut her
lack of experience isn’t hamper-
ing her performance on the Pitt
team. ,

“Robyn is thriving in college
gymnastics,” said ‘Yohman.

Although the vault is‘ her
favorite event, her scores don’t

indicate that she’s lacking in

other events.-

Her ‘all aroundscore at Pitt’s «

Temple meet was 57.175 —
.725 points from vaulting on
Pitt’s all time top ten.

Senior said that hopefully
she’ll be on the top ten list some
day. . .

But when asked about per-
sonal scores, ‘she is quick to
shift focus to the team.

“I think everyone on our team
has the potential to get up there
as_ long as we get ours_el,ves
together in certain events, like
beam,” Senior said.

“Everyone is pulling for .each

g other.”

At their home opener, the
team had some difficulties with
the balance beam, and they lost
a close meet to Temple.

“We could have won that
meet,” said Senior. “But [the

loss] helped us realize wliat we ‘

reallyneeded to work on 
now we can start getting our-
selves together.”

Senior is confident that the

‘ . team attitude will.be a strength.

“Everyone is going to try their
best no matter what,” said
Senior.

“And the coaches are very
supportive.” , ' C

Senior says thatlshe and the

team have a good relationship .

with Yohman and assistant
coach Ben Roveef

“[Yohmanl keeps us in line,
and everyone knows that we
have to respect what she tells us
to do,” Senior said. “But every-
one can be open with them and
talk to them.”

“She is improving, and she’s
just going to keep getting better
and better,” Yohman said.

he one—timed a pass from
Rizzo along the ice and
straight into the back of the
net to send the Dukes to the

_locker room contemplating a

2-0 deficit.

After the teams took the
ice for the start of the second
period, however, it was
Duquesne who looked to be
the stronger of the two, and
seemed determined to atone
for the early first-period
defensive miscues. V

They started the comeback
early in the second frame
when captain Paul Sciullo
one-timed a shot past

Bratkovich from the left of

the net to cut Pitt’s lead to 2-
1. O

Panther captain Disanti,
however, was not about to
let his team lose the early
edge they had gained and
restored the two-goal lead
when he took a feed from

Rizzo across the ‘goal mouth
’ and notched his second goal
of the game to make it 3-1.

Moments later, Bratkovich
held the game’s outcome in
his hands when he faced "a
Dukes’ winger bearing down
onhim with an uncontested
breakaway.

After his shot glanced off
Bratkovich’s pads and off to
the l.eft of the
the Pitt bench erupted,
and the Panthers took over
the game. ’

Duquesne would score
the next goal of the game,
making it 3-2, but three con-

secutive Panther. gpals to‘

close out the contest gave
iPitt an undeniable sense of
vindication after two stinging
losses to the. Dukes last sea-
son. .
The two teams will next
meet on Wednesday, Feb. 9,

However, if last night was any
indication as to any future meet-

Bormet has a hard road ahead

Smith dominated Bormet
