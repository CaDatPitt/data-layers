Symposium Investigates    

  at Import of Bakke Case

By TOM KUKUCKA

The Black Law Student’s Assoc-
iation held a symposium Monday
night at Pitt’s Law School to discuss
the ramiﬁcations of the Bakke court
case which involves charges of
reverse discrimination.

The Black Law Students Associa-
tion of Duquesne and Pitt
Universities sponsored the sympos-
ium in conjunction with the Black
Lawyers Association of Western
Pennsylvania.

The case is extremely important
because it could find some of the
manifestations of the civil rights
legislation of the 60’s to be unfair
and unconstitutional.

Allan Bakke, a _37-year-old white
engineer was refused admission to
the University of California’s Davis
Medical School in 1973 and 1974.
Bakke maintained he was more
qualiﬁed than many of the minority
students that were admitted to the
school in those years. He sued,
charging the special-admissions
program employed by UC-Davis
with reverse discrimination because
it allowed minorities with lower
grade point averages and standard-

I ized test scores than his to be

  admitted.

:

@“t:’. A

The case went through the state
courts in California, reaching the
California Supreme _Court, which
ruled in Bakke’s favor. It is
currently before the United States
Supreme Court where arguments

for both sides will be heard starting
Oct. 12.

A panel of ﬁve prominent legal
and educational experts from the
Pittsburgh area spoke on different
aspects of the Bakke situation.

Speaking at the gathering were
Professor Richard Seeburger from
Pitt’s School of Law; Dean Ronald
Davenport of Duquesne Law
School; Dr. Norman Dixon, profes-
sor of education at Pitt; Dr. Jack
Daniels, Pitt associate dean of the
College of Arts and Sciences, and

Phil Carter, professor at Pitt’s

_ Graduate School of Public and

International Affairs (GSPIA), and
chairperson of the Black Political
Assembly. Pam Arnold, a
third-year law student at Pitt,
served as moderator. ‘

The ﬁnancial future of Pennsyl-
vania’s state-related universities
remains uncertain this week, as the
State Legislature concentrates on
work other than funding for
non-preferred appropriations.

The Legislature’s inaction costs
Pitt thousands of dollars daily.

While the legislators may be
discussing privately the funding of

932%

Pitt Law School’s Mott Courtroom was the setting for Monday’s symposium on
the Bakke reverse discrimination case. Sponsored by the Black Law Students
Association of Pitt and Duquesne, the symposium dealt with the legal
ramifications of the case’.

Pitt Finances Still Uncertain

$300 million in appropriations, $61.7
million of which is slated for Pitt, no
ﬂoor action is likely to occur soon.

‘‘I feel certain no action will come
up this week,” said Louis Tronzo,
Pitt’s assistant director of govern-
mental relations. “The Legislature
doesn’t want to go through the same
ﬁasco as happened before (repre-
sentatives spent over six weeks this
summer rejecting budget propos-
als).’’

With the Legislature inactive,
student leaders are stepping up
efforts to infbrm students and
lobby Harrisburg on the plight of
the universities. -

Representatives from the four
affected schools, Pitt, Penn State,
Temple and Lincoln, met in
Philadelphia this past weekend and
updated its plans for the pending
budget battle.

Talks between legislators and the
school student government presi-
dents have been arranged for
today, and a press conference will
follow. At that press conference,
the presidents are expected to give
a status report on the appropria-
tions situation.

' Friday, Pitt’s Student Task Force

23rd District; Ronald Cowell, (D),
34th District and Jack Freeman,
Pitt’s vice chancellor for planning
and budget.

Penn State, Temple and Lincoln
have scheduled educational rallies

- for Oct. 12. Pitt’s task force also

tentatively has planned a rally for
that day.

The university administrations
have begun to widen their attack on
the legislature as they urge alumni
to help in the ﬁght, bringing their
message to the people through a

Dormitory

Purchase

Confirmed

I By DAVID STERN

Pitt signed a contract last week

confirming the purchase of the .

Forbes Pavilion Nursing Home for
use as a student dormitory.

The $1 million purchaseiwas
made possible through a $1.7
million loan with three percent
interest rate from the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban
Development (HUD).

The tentative opening date for
the new dormitory is the fall of
1978.

The HUD loan was necessary to
purchase the Forbes Pavillion
facility because dormitories are
classed as auxiliary enterprises,
which cannot be purchased or
maintained by state funds or tuition
monies, according to Joseph
Dutton, vice chancellor of business
and ﬁnance.

The building will accommodate.
approximately 200 students after
renovation, and will help ease the
University’s housing shortage.
The University now has 3,600 dorm
spaces for an undergraduate
population of approximately
18.000.

Many Pitt students currently are

being housed at Carlow College 7

Bakke Case Discussed
By Law Student Group

Iv Milieu /mm /‘tr.

tions by the speakers, followed by
questions from the audience and
informal discussion at a reception
outside the Law Schoo1’s moot court
room.

The Justice Department in a
recent report has taken the
following stand: “Race may be
taken into account to counteract the
effects of prior discrimination.”

The Carter administration, how»

ever, has taken a very “narrow

approach” to the Bakke case. The:
Justice Department is urging the
Supreme Court to order the case:
back to the lower courts in:
California.

Dixon believes this to be the best
measure.

“The lower courts really did not
collect enough data to make the
dﬁcisions that they made at ﬁrst,”
Dixon said. “If they had really
studied the Bakke situation they
probably would have rendered
another decision.” E

Dixon, who spoke on “the politics
and sociology of testing,” is
adamantly against standardized
testing such as college, medical or
law school admissions tests. He
believes such testing cannot take
into account various sociological
and geographical factors and are
therefore invalid.

“Test producers should use their
technologies to develop new and
different assessment techniques
which are fair and accurate,” he
said. “Until that time, I
would strongly recommend that we
choose students by open admissions
processes or by lottery.”

Seeburger, whose topic “Af-
firmative Action from a Legal
Perspective,” believes such pro-
grams as school desegregation and
“hiring quota systems” are unaf-
fecterl hy the Hakka? case; hllt it
ruling in favor of Bakke could effect
the future of special-admissions
programs in American universities.

Davenport (“Constitutional Is-
sues Surrounding Bakke”) does not
believe the case to be as cataclysmic
as many people fear.

Daniels (“affirmative action - the
University Experience”) strongly

Whole Pie
Half Pie

disagrees. Referring to the “Bakke
monster,” Daniels maintained that
unless action is taken to defeat
Bakke, it will spell doom for blacks
in graduate and undergraduate
schools. Daniels believes that the

Bakke Case could be detrimental to
the quota system at American
universities and could wipe out
advances made by blacks in the last
decade.

“Quotas are absolutely necessary
if we are to have progress,” he said.

“We have got to pull together, or
Bakke will merely be the tip of the
iceberg.

Phil Carter (“The Aftermath of
Bakke - What Must Be Done”)
considers the Bakke case a poor
representative for the argument of
reverse discrimination.

“Not only was he turned down by
Davis Medical School,”Mr. Carter
said, “but he was rejected by his
own alma mater, the University of
Minnesota.” Citing the record from
the Davis Medical School, Carter
continued, “a total of 35 people
would have been considered ahead
of Bakke even if the university had
not set aside 16 slots for those of
economically and educationally
disadvantage background.”

Mr. Carter ended his presenta-
tion with a quote from Attorney
General Griffin Bell.

“Whites are going to have to give
something up temporarily to
accommodate everyone in the
American constitutional system.”

Dorm Deal
Closed By

((‘mtlinu€dfr()m Page I)
and me Hotel Webster Hall in

- Oakland. Webster Hall: according

to Dutton, may be unavailable for
use as a University dormitory as
early as this spring, due to a
change in the hotel's management.

“There will be a crying need and
demand for the Forbes Pavillion,
without Webster Hall to hold an
overﬂow,” Dutton said.

A hearing before the Pittsburgh
City Council and the City Planning
Commission is slated for Oct. 11.
The University must gain council
and planning commission approval
before renovations can proceed at
Forbes Pavillion.

Dutton also has contacted the
Chamber of Commerce about the
University’s plans. According to
Dutton, there are no real obstacles
to the new dormitory, and he
expects it will meet with city
approval.

“There is no ﬁrm opposition that
I’m aware of,” Dutton said.

Exterior renovations, such as
repairing broken windows and
leaky roofs, will be carried out by
Pitt employes to prevent further
deterioration of the Forbes Pavil-
lion facility.

A complete renovation project is
not scheduled, Dutton said, as no
contractor yet has been selected to
work on the building.

New Year

The Student Affairs Advisory
Committee yesterday met with the
administration for the ﬁrst time in
the 1977 fall term.

The committee, composed of
student group leaders, meets
monthly to discuss issues concern-
ing both the students and the
Administration.

‘ ‘It’s a sounding board to tell each
other about our problems,” Chan-
cellor Posvar said.

Representatives from the Inter-
Fraternity Council, the Resident
Student Association, Student Gov-
ernment and other activities were
present, along with representatives
from the Administration.

,~«;,~. .ﬁ.“If you have a problem, we’re

ere. Give us an opportunity to
help,” said Bill Markus, acting vice
chancellor of student affairs.
“Feel free to let us know about your
concerns.The door is open,” Posvar
said.

Items discussed at the meeting
included problems involving the
campus bus system and the lack of
space available to black fraternities
for large social activities.

Bernie Payne, Student Govern-
ent Board president, feels the
ampus bus system lacks enough
vehicles, is not as reliable as it
should be and the system's time
schedule and route patterns are not
well-displayed.

Posvar suggested improving
display of schedules a routes by
placing maps of the routes in the
bus shelters and on the backs’ of the
bus schedule hand outs. .

Black fraternities are concerned
about the recent closing of part of
the Lothrop Hall east wing to
fraternity functions.

Issues to be discussed in future
meetings include a mandatory

ECONOMIC ADVISER REJECTS
PROTECTION OF STEEL INDUS-
TRY
DETROIT (AP)—Despite lay-
offs in the steel industry, President
Carter’s top economic adviser
Monday rejected protectionism for
the industry. I

And, said Charles L. Schultze,
chairman of the Council of
Economic Advisers, the summer’s
economic pause is temporary.

“If you look at the rate at which
sales are rising,” Schultze said at a
news conference before speaking to
the Economic Club of Detroit, “we
believe employment and production
are going to catch up.”

Schultze was asked what should
be done about layoffs in the steel
industry, which steelmakers have
blamed on rising imports.

Department proposed special anti-

ese ﬁrms it said were selling steel
here below their own costs.

‘The proportion of steel imported
is actually less than the proportion
of autos imported,” Schultze said.

Schultze said he opposed pro-
tecting the steel industry through
import quotas or higher tariffs. “In
my judgement, the government

should not prop up the steel
industry, if you only mean propping
it up. The steel industry has a
number of problems, one of which is
layoffs.”

A Question of Guilt

The September suicide of Pitt research associate Dr. Dorothy
South, subject of recent charges of Pitt sexism by several feminists,
was as are most suicides, unfortunate. But the feminists’ decision
to declare South a martyr, creating a circus-like air about her

death, is equally unfortunate.

National Organization for Women founder Betty Friedan
speaking at Heinz Chapel, blamed unemployment-spawned
despondency and even her death on Pitt sexism. The facts do not
support her claim, though it is possible the School of Medicine's
biochemistry department—target of suspiciously’extraordinary
number of discrimination complaints—could have been a bit more

helpful in its effort to place South.

South came to Pitt solely because she was to work on a grant-

supported research project.

Although her work was not

questioned, she was without doubt aware of the tenousness of her
position: when the grant ended, so did her job. The grant ended
recently. South, unable to secure work at another school, tried to
kill herself four times and succeeded in early September.

Pitt did not owe South a job; in fact, it probably would have
been wrong for Pitt to pick up where the grant left off. But we are
sure South’s colleagues, who are reported to have worked in ear-
nest to assist a man whose work ended at approximately the same
time as South’s might have worked harder on her behalf.

That Pitt did not directly cause the death of Dorothy South,
howeverfshould be remembered, especially by those who have
done some unscientific extrapolation and found that Pitt—a
necessarily large and impersonal institution, therefore easy to
blame—killed Dorothy South. It may have been with a little help
from others, but in the end, she killed herself.

Bakke: Win or Lose, An Impact on Education

By R. DAVID TIVE

On October 12, the United States
Supreme Court will hear argu-
ments in a case which may have a
massive impact on higher educa-
tion in this country. In fact, if .the
Court issues a sweeping ruling,
dealing with more than just the
parties directly involved in the
case, then much more of our
society than higher education will
feel the impact. .

The case is that of Allan Bakke v.
the Regents of the University of
California. The suit stems from

Bakke’s rejection from the ‘Univer-

sity of California -"at Davis.'Medieal
School. After being rejected twice.’.

Bakke sued the school charging the‘

was the victim of reverse discrim-
ination.
The speciﬁcs of the charge are

‘that a rigid quota system at

California-Davis requires that
sixteen out of one hundred spots in
each medical school class must be
reserved for minority students
(Chicano and Asian-American as
well as black) even if their

qualiﬁcations are lower than those
of a white applicant. Bakke alleges
that had he been given equal
treatment and consideration he
would have been admitted. But the
special consideration given the
minority applicants prevented him
from getting equal treatment and
resulted in his being discriminated
against. The implicit assumption is
that this discrimination was racial,
and no more justified than dis-
crimination against any other racial
group. ”_ V

The repercussions of the case
will extend far beyond the
California-Davis Medical School. If

' the Court rules against Bakke, it

will be going on record as saying
that quotas are acceptable and a
valid means of redressing past
injustices. Such an opinion would,
if it is not written in very specific
language, have the potential of
hurting the very people the Court
would be trying to help by issuing
such a ruling.

If the Court rules in favor of
Bakke, then the quota system at
California-Davis would be tossed
out the window. So too could many

THE THOUGHT Of THE ?HlLLlES NOT CHOKNC:

 

The Pitt News enjoys using
this space to publish letters
from its readers. However, our
ability to do this as often as we
would like is hampered greatly
by writers’ tendency not to sign

Cormick Resident.”

similar, if perhaps less rigid,
programs at many other schools.

It seems to be a no-win situation.

As much as I can see the need for
special programs for disadvan-
taged students, the idea of quotas
scares me. Quotas can be used
either way. They can work for or
against those in society who need
the ‘protection of the law in order to
be guaranteed their rights and
equal opportunity. Quotas can
become a valuable tool to protect
the "status quo and the privileged
groups in this country. Quotas can
also, of course, be a means for
change, a way of helping those in
need of help.‘ -However, given the
general‘ a_tt—itudes and trends
prevalent in this country, I am
afraid the latter effect would not be
common.

The other side of the coin is just
as bad. A Court ruling against
California-Davis could be read as a
statement that all programs of
minority-sensitive admissions are
outlawed. This would be a disaster
for those students being accepted
at schools, not under quotas, but
with special consideration for their

unequal preparation. No one who
has-paid any attention at all to our
national racial problems can deny
that students at primarily black
high schools, particularly in the
inner cities, ‘get a poorer education
than those at white high schools in
the suburbs. They therefore score
lower on college admissions rank-
ings, even though their native
abilities may’ be as high or higher
than other students‘ ranking above
them. Many “schools -now,
j-ustiﬁably accept these students
under what‘ are called minority-
sensitive admissions, programs. A
Court ruling in‘ favor of; Bakke
might jeopardize»itho_se programs.’

We are caught Von-"the hori17s.Io_f-‘-a.
dilemma. ‘A decisionll in favor of

quotas is a two-edged sword,1,ar_id..
given the nature of most institu-_,,
tions in our society, ‘higher ,

education being one of the better
ones, it will most often be used to
protect those on the inside, not
those on the outside. A decision
the other way may destroy valid,
non-discriminatory p‘-jograms which
aid the disadvantaged.

Briefs have been filed with the

Supreme Court by many interested
groups, and there are well-respect-
ed organizations on both sides.
One of those briefs however, the
one filed by the United States
Department of Justice, has sug-
gested a way out of the dilemma.
The Justice Department brief
urges the Court to, in essense,
judge the case on the merits of
what happened at California-Davis,
and not to pass judgment on
quotas in general. This. would
seem to be the best course, if the
Court ﬁnds it to be legally possible.
As a society. still trying to come to
grips with its racial problems, we
would be much better off if a

:__decision on quotas could be
“. delayed. It is hoped all the furor

over the Bakke case has created
enough interest that someone will
challenge the minority-sensitive
admissions programs in the courts.

Once these have been upheld, it
will be far less dangerous to handle
the quota problem. We can only
hope that the Supreme Court, still
primarily a Nixon court, will haw‘.

construction will be something
over $10 billion.

Although it is being billed as
“the largest project in the history
of the world,” the new gas
transmission line has generated a
remarkable lack of controversy in
the United. States. Government.
industry, and the few citizens
familiar with Alcan all seem to feel
the pipeline is obviously needed,
the technical problems can be
solved, and that's about all there
is to it.

But that's not all there is to it.
Construction of the Alcan pipeline
poses unique problems and raises
important questions for Canadi-
ans and Americans alike.

The Canadian government at
least tacitly acknowledged these
questions and problems in 1976,
when it appointed Justice Thomas
Berger to study the potential
social and environmental effects
of northern development in that
country. At that time, Arctic Gas,
a consortium of 15 American and

Canadian companies including _ u_

Gulf, Exxon and Shell, was the
leading contender in the pipeline
sweepstakes. Arctic Gas pro-
posed to build the line across the
northern Yukon and then through
the Northwest Territories along
the Mackenzie Valley, and it was
this route that Justice Berger
studied. After interviewing over
1,000 people from various walks
of life and in different areas-—
public interest groups in Toronto,
land developers in the northwest,
‘native trappers in the. Yukon-
Justice Berger recommended that
no pipeline be built « in the
Mackenzie Valley for at least ten
years. In addition, he said that
plans to run the line through the
northern Yukon should be aban-
doned altogether.

Justice Berger's objections to
immediate construction of the
pipeline were centered in two
areas: environmental problems
and the need for an equitable
.sett.té.ra¢nt 9_f."%*i"‘~’ claims-. . .

!.

After studying the unique
eco-system of the northern
Yukon, Justice Berger concluded
that it would be impossible to
construct a pipeline along the
arctic coast without causing
severe environmental damage.

Building a pipeline means more ,

than stringing along a large-dia-
meter metal tube; it means roads,
airstrips, warehouses and pollu-
tion as well. The introduction of
these things into the delicate
ecological balance of the northern
Yukon would almost certainly
result in population declines in
many mammal and bird species,
particularly Porcupine caribou
and snow geese, which in turn
would undermine the hunting
economy of the area’s native
people. Other environmental
concerns included the probable
adverse eﬁects of construction in
the Mackenzie Delta and the need
for “comprehensive land use

  ,P“.“9i'}8 .1“ ‘*3? "4*°“.°“.1i° "‘“°Y-"

Even more than environmental
problems, the Berger report
emphasized the need for a just
settlement of native land claims
before the approval of any
pipeline. White and native
populations in Canada’s northe
areas are roughly equal in size, he
said, but the natives make up the
majority of permanent residents;
many whites are public officials
and developers who eventually
return to the South. As in the
United States, respect among
whites for native culture has
historically been less than what
might be desired.

Although the stated purpose of
the Mackenzie Valley pipeline
was to provide more energy for
the growth economy in the south,
northern developers consistently
justiﬁed it on the grounds that it
would provide needed jobs for
native peoples. In fact. the only
jobs for natives during pipeline

contruction would be in the

unskilled and semi-skilled areas.
After completion, only about 250
workers would be needed to
maintain the line, and most of
these would be technically know-
ledgeable whites imported from
the South. According to Justice
Berger, creation of a wage-eco-
nomy in the Canadian North
would cause serious economic
problems there. As hunting,
ﬁshing, and trapping became less
important and less viable occupa-
tions, many of the self-employed
would become unemployed mem-
bers of the welfare rolls.

The vast majority of Canada’s
natives are fearful of alcoholism,
environmental damage, and their
disintegration as a people in the
face of northern development.
History is replete with examples

of rising social pathology follow-.

ing forced assimilation of cultural
minorities, and construction of a
pipeline at this point would result
in problems not curable by
after-the-fact social programs.
Still, Canada’s native peoples
are not absolutely opposed to the
eventual construction of a pipe-
line. They only insist that an
equitable settlement of their
claims and an acknowledgement
of their right to self-determination
precede any massive technologi-
cal intrusion into their homeland.
Otherwise, once a pipeline con-
struction begins and whites start
pouring into the area, native
claims will be pushed aside and

their political power will diminish.

A 10-year moratorium on con-
struction in the Mackenzie Valley
was needed, said Justice Berger,
if these complex issues were to be
dealt with properly.

Due at least in part to the
Berger Commission’s report, the
Arctic Gas pipeline proposal was

rejected. Instead, with a ﬂourish

that smells a little like issue-
evasion, the Alcan route was
approved.

The Northwest Energy Com-
pany was a late entry in the
pipeline contract competition, and
as a result. no thorough investiga-
tion has been made regarding the
Alcan route’s environmental im-
pact. The fact that the Alcan
pipeline will largely parallel the
Alaska Highway has been ad-
vanced as an argument in its favor
(i.e.. environmental damage has
already been done), but this
seems something less than
satisfactory. In addition, native

ﬂdims along the Alcan route

remain unsettled. As Justice
Berger feared, and has happened
so many times in the past. the
American and Canadian govern-
ments have apparently chosen to
decide the native peoples’ future
for them.

And there is yet another reason
why the Alcan pipeline might not
be the unqualiﬁed good cele-
brated in the Carter and Trudeau
press releases. Even if environ-
mental questions are answered

‘pd native claims justly settled.

The age for female engineers has
arrived and is here to stay. The time
for male nurses has yet to begin.
Female engineers are bright,
energetic and their numbers are
growing steadily. Male nurses are
few, but in their minority they are
dedicated and enthusiastic about
making a better world.

Charles Aveni, director of
student affairs in the School of
Engineering, said that ten years ago
there were ‘ ‘maybe 10 females’ ’ in a
class of 1500. Today there are 336
students in a class of about 1650.

“Nationally there have been
more women studying the field of
engineering at the undergraduate
level than there have ever been in
the past,” Aveni said.

The depressed job market, the
government’s affirmative action
program to recruit minorities and
the easing of sex roles have caused
the female engineer increase.
Aveni believed women can ap-
proach an equal level of men by
using their academic skills in this
challenging ﬁeld where “the word

jobs with good money.”

“Women are aware of the
challenge. They’re aware there are
ways to use these skills in an area
that before had not really been
considered, ” Aveni said.

Chris Blackmond, a senior
electrical engineering student and
president of the Society of Women
Engineers, agrees. As part of SWE,
she wants to inform people women
can be engineers and to encourage
women who excel in math and
science to explore these careers.

‘ ‘When Iwas in high school, I was
good in physics and I was good in
math, but I might not have thought
about engineering unless someone
told me the career existed,”
Blackmond said. “Men are often
told, ‘Okay, you can be an
engineer,’ and women are told,
‘Well, if you’re interested in math,
-you can be a nurse.’ ”

Blackmond said women who go
into engineering can’t be categor-
ized, but they are usually highly
motivated and choose speciﬁc
careers for the same reasons men
do. For example, many women go
into chemical engineering because
chemical engineers earn the highest

[\

salaries.

As to the problems of sex
discrimination, Blackmond said the
only male dominated ﬁeld women
suffer in is mining.

“In mining engineering there are
very few women. That’s also where
a lot of stereotypes are still held.
For instance, in some mines in
Kentucky they are very supersti-
tious about letting women in.”

Blackmond hasn’t found too
much difference in the treatment
men and women receive in
engineering class, but said women
take precautions against discrimi-
nation. They sign their homework
with their ﬁrst initials and last
names, thus the instructors can’t
tell if they are male or female.

Blackmond believes the job
opportunities for women are
promising.

“The qualiﬁcations a company

looks at when they hire people are
your grades and your extra-curri-
cular activities. As it turns out, the
women are doing better in school
and they’re more involved in
extra- curricular activities. So
naturally they have an advantage.
Even if they were men, they’d have
an advantage because of these
things.”

Blackmond believes women en-
gineers are breaking new ground in
society and believes today’s women
engineers shoulder a great respon-

sibility to those in the future.
“We’re always under pressure.

People are always looking at us,
saying you’re a woman engineer
therefore whatever you do is what
other women are going to do. A
man can just get through school.
For a women, you have to do just a
little bit better if you want to have
the same respect given to you.”

Both Blackmond and Aveni
believe women have whole heartid-
ly taken on the challenge of
engineering and are doing very well
with it. .

“Male nurse” may sound like a

contradiction in terms, but accord- ,

in g to Mary Scarry, student advisor
for the School of Nursing, their
numbers are continually increasing.
Today l8 men are part of Pitt’s
nursing student body which totals
620. Overwhelming numbers these
aren't, but the few men who have
entered the profession have found
nursing a way to express themsel-
ves through helping people.

Tom Russell, a junior always
attracted to the health professions,
chose nursing as his way to help
people. Russell chose Pitt because
he strongly believes in the patient
as an individual, an idea called
Patient Center Care, which is

stressed here.
The problems Russell has found

being a male nurse are stronger on
the outside than in the school.

“The connotations are still strong
toward male nurses. I don't know
whoever said it was a female
profession. It’s a female-dominated
profession. There’s a big
difference! ’ ’

Entering nursing school, Russell
said the women often look down on
the men.

A reBa yard Street Fraternities  Bargain ?

By DAVE McDONALD

Pitt News Staff Writer

Last time I left off down on the
Bayard Street battleground. Once
again I returned to Bayard St., this
time in the heart of the battlezone,
with Zeta Beta Tau and Kappa
Sigma covered in this report. Also
reviewed on this excursion is a
fraternity slightly removed from the
eastern Bayard St. fraternities: Phi

appa Theta.

Across from one of the major
opponents of the Bayard St.
fraternities is a brightly painted
blue house, the home of Zeta Beta
Tau. Dan Lewis, president of. ZBT
claims his fraternity has the best
“brothers” .

“‘We not only have the best
brothers, but our house is in better
shape physically than most,” Lewis
said. “Last year we were voted the
most improved chapter from 85
other ZBT chapters.”

Zeta Beta Tau is currently
without cooking facilities, but Lewis
assured me that they would be
provided with some by the end of
the year. It currently has 32

members in its chapter, with 15 '

living in the larger-than-average
size house. The ﬁrst floor of the
house is very large with a big living
room containing modern furniture.

Downstairs, which still had all of
the remains of the previous night’s
party, was also roomy with
considerable space for a band or for
dancing (it once had parties upstairs
but in compromise with the
neighbors they are now held in the
basement).

The fees at ZBT are about

average for Pitt fraternities. The
pledge fee is $25, the initiation-fee
is 5120, all of which goes to the
national ZBT ‘(which is a good
naitonal, according to Lewis) and
dues per term amount to $135. For
living in the house it costs the
“brothers” an additional $300 per
term.

Phi Kappa Theta, on Bayard St.
but not considered in the battlezone
with the other Bayard St. frats since
it is up the street is nestled between
two large apartment buildings.

“Like Delta Sigma Chi we have
no problems with neighbors,”
according to Don Poland, secretary
of the Phi Kaps.

Phi Kappa Theta, with its 51
members, has captured the IFC
all-sports trophy the last seven of
eight years, making it probably

number one among Pitt fraternities‘

in intramurals.

Poland, in promoting his frater-
nity, was also very supportive of the
entire Greek system. “Last year
our fraternity gave l00°7o to the
blood drive along with all of the

other Greeks, ’ ’Poland said. ‘ ‘Other
good aspects of being in a national
fraternity is being able to transfer
from another school and have
“brothers” at the school you are
transfering to.” (This was the case
with Poland.)

Phi Kappa Theta, a “don’t
-judge-a-book-by-its-cover-story, ’ ’
is in need of repair on the outside,
but it is very reﬁned on the inside.

The pool room looks like a
reconverted dining room with a

large tiffany lamp hanging above a
good-looking pool table. The walls
of the room, like most of the house,
are done with beautiful -wood
paneling. also on the ﬁrst floor with
the poolroom is a comfortable TV
room equipped with a color TV, a
trophy room and a kitchen which
includes a microwave oven.
Of the 17 members who live in the

house, most have large, paneled
bedrooms. Downstairs, where the

  L, United Way Offers
0 Month-long Activities

By GARY GRAFF

Ask the person next to you what
the United Way is. He will probably
tell you that it is a group of football
players who make commercials.
Despite the NFL’s publicity cam-
paign, many people really don't
know what the United Way is all
about.

That’s the purpose of the United
Way University of Pittsburgh
Student Campaign, which will run
through October.

“The main thrust of our
campaign is to educate the students
about the United Way,” said Elaine
Johnson, co-coordinator of the
campaign. “Fundraising is secon-
dary.”

The money may not be of primary
interest, but the coordinators have
set a goal of $400 to be raised by the
campaign programs.

“We think it’s a reasonable
goal,” said Sheridan Glenn, the
campaign’s other co-coordinator,
“especially since there are 30,000
students at Pitt. If each one gave us
a nickel, we’d be in great shape.”

Last year’s United Way campaign
raised $371.

The campaign will begin this
week with informational booths
setting up in the Towers, Schenley
Hall and other points in the Pitt
campus. The booths will be staffed
by agency personnel and student
volunteers. A booth will also be set '
up at the Greek’s Festival, which
will run Oct. 7-9. i '

A program will be held at
halftime during the Homecoming
game, according to the United Way

campaign also will hold a carnival at
the end of the month. Student
groups will be invited to participate.

“They’re very apprehensive of
your being there because you’re
striking tradition. I believe in so
much tradition, but I wouldn’t be in
the profession ifl let it run my life.
The guys are in the same boat; they
become good friends, but, slowly.
once you meet the girls they begin

  accept you.”

In the hospital, where he is
considered a professional person
and part of the health related staff,
Russell ﬁnds being a male nurse is
to his advantage. ~

“When it comes to lifting a
patient, when somebody needs
some kind of help, it seems it’s
always: ‘Hey Tom come here,’ or
‘Hey Ron come here.’ But I enjoy it.
That way I’m getting more
experience and am really gettingto

 ow people and help them.”

Russell said at first patientsare
apprehensive of a male nurse, but
by bending a few rules a good
rapport can be built.

To increase enrollment, Russell

believes more male instructors are ‘

needed. He ﬁnds the men
sometimes have to talk to a man who
has already gone through the
nursing profession.

The ever-present need for nurses
and the assurance of well-paying
jobs complete the male nurses
reasons for being in school. As
Russell said, “If you really enjoy it,
it makes sense. Tradition says,
‘Stay away!’ but common sense
says, ’Do it!”’

,._,_,.¢.~;-»:e-.w..a»..'a,:,..~.;..-.-

All funds raised at the carnival will
go to the United Way.

A “thank you” dance for
volunteers will be held during the
last week of October, marking the
end of the campaign.

Johnson and Glenn are both
undergraduates in social work at
Pitt. The chairman of the United
Way campain is Dean Davis
Epperson of the School of Social
Work.

The United Way of Allegheny
County helps support some 160
services and agencies in the area,
including the Red Cross and the Boy
Scouts of America. The organiza-
tion has been working in Allegheny
County since 1908.

* “People think they’ll never use
the services funded by the United
Way,” said Glenn, “but many of
these services, such as the
Health-O-Rama are used primarily
by students.” '

The Health-O-Rama provides
free medical services and is used
frequently by Pitt students.

Throughout the month, expect to
see the booths, the canisters and the
posters for the campaign. The
football players won’t be around but
the United Way will.

Pitt News Staff Writer

The condition of the Cathedral
Commons Room, a room used
primarily by commuters, is deter-
iorating, according to Acting Vice
Chancelor for Student Affairs,
William Markus.

“There are paper wrappings,
litter and cigarette butts spewn all
over the tables and the floor. It is
an obviously untidy situation,”
Markus said. “I have expressed
concern over this deteriorating
condition to ( Student Government
Board member) Dave Hesidence.

“There is a prohibition against
eating and drinking in the
Commons Room. It is not a
cafeteria, but it is being used as
one. There aren’t proper recep-
tacles for the litter from the fast
food restaurants. There aren"t
proper receptacles for cigarette
butts, so they are stomped out on
the tables or the benches or the
floors.

Survey ShowsDissatisfaction

A recent survey of Port Authority
Transit (PAT) bus and trolley car
riders indicates 78 percent of those
polled are dissatisﬁed with transit
service.

The survey was coordinated by

-- Concerned Passengers, a volunteer

citizens group organized to identify
and study problems in the operation
of public transit;

A preliminary report of the
survey, which includes 200 res-
ponses -from 85 different routes,
shows:

-38 percent of the riders polled
are upset about buses not arriving,
especially on routes that receive
little service and on late—evening
runs; -

-23 percent said buses are
frequently late;

-10 percent said buses pass
without stopping;
-22 percent reported buses are

—-seven percent said buses are
early;
——two percent indicated they would
stop using PAT.

“I talked to Hesidence to see if
there could be a simple solution to
the problem,” Markus continued.
“-‘Before any unilateral administra-
tive action is taken, I thought it
would be good to have a student
solution to the problem. I
understand Dave has passed the
issue on to the commuter commit-
tee.”

The commuter committee is an
ad-hoc committee of the SGB.

“We will be meeting tomorrow
to discuss solutions to the
problem,” Diane Behers, acting
co-chairman of the committee,
said. “Vice Chancellor Markus has
been invited to come to our
meeting to offer suggestions.”

“If enforcement of the no-food
and no-drink rule is what is
needed, then that is what we’ll
do,” Markus said. “If receptacles
are the answer, then we’ll get
receptacles. It is just a matter of
having a little pride. The
Commons Room is a lovely and

Part two of the survey questioned
riders on driver conduct. Replies in
this area indicate:

-52 percent said drivers are safe
and courteous; .

—-24 percent said drivers are
indifferent, discourteous and insult-
me;

——24 percent believe drivers are
unsafe; unsafe operations indicated
include speeding, slamming on
brakes, going through stop signs
and red lights and overcrowding
buses and trolleys.

The condition of vehicles was
another area included in the survey.
Of those polled:

--45 percent feel buses and
trolleys are dirty;

-27 percent believe buses are in
poor repair; defects mentioned
include poor shocks, torn seats, no
air-conditioning and broken win-
dows;

—— 10 percent said buses are
disabled, causing delays;

-18 percent said buses are clean
and in good repair.

The study will be completed later

beautiful place, but it has
deteriorated," Markus said.

“If the commuter committee
wants to tackle the problem, then
there will be no unilateral action on
my part. But I’m seriously
concerned. I’m sure going to press
discussion of the problem,” Mar-
kus said.

Behers said the committee is
looking into the problems.

“It is a serious situation. The
people who use the Commons
Room are not aware they may lose
the use of the room,” Behers said.

Other planned activities for the
commuter committee include an
active role in homecoming festiv-
ities.

“We’re going to build a
commuter ﬂoat and enter a team in
the barrel-rolling contest. We are
also going to sponsor Homecoming
King and Queen candidates.”
Behers said.

this year, and a ﬁnal report will be
prepared.

“We will present the report to the
Allegheny County Commissioners
and to PAT,” said Jo Anne Russell
of Concerned Passengers. ‘ ‘We will
include recommendations in the
report and we are going to ask that
our report be considered as
legitimate. We will ask that our
recommendations be acted upon by
the commissioners and PAT.”

Markus Says Commons Room Deterioratingg

In an effort to determine the
needs of commuters, the commuter
committee. and the SGB Research
Committee will conduct a poll.

“We will use the results as a
guideline for future programming
ideas. We are also considering a
trip to the National Clearinghouse
for Commuters in College Park,

Md. It is the national information
center for commuters,” Behers
added.

“We also want to set up a
commuter intramural program on
the Cathedral lawn. It would be
very informal—something com-
muters could do during the day,”
she said.

 



The condition of the Cathedral Commons Room, used primarily by commuters
during the day, is deteriorating because of litter, paper mappings and cigaret-
te buts, according to Acting Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs William

Markus.

Measure Still For Measure

Page l4—THE PITT NEWS-—W_ednesday

Shakespeare Revised

By PAMELA EUSI
Pitt News Staff Writer

Alternative theater is a cleans-
ing process. It allows creation
within the conﬁnes of a broad
system and yet remains entirely
unconventional to the point of
radicalism. It hits one in the face
with the full force of a wintry
blast.

Coming from the production of
“Measure Still for Measure” by
the Pennsylvania Repertory Thea-
tre, I began to reassess some of
my values and redirect my
thinking of “theater.”

“Measure Still for Measure” is
a work based on Shakespeare’s
“Measure for Measure.” It
incorporates the play, thoughts on
the world at the time of the
original Elizabethan production
and additional “language” from
criticisms of the play, a poem
addressed to Shakespeare and a
play about the last weeks of
Shakespeare’s life after he re-
turned home.

The production itself ap-
proaches the standard version
from many directions. Emotions
are thrown out and tossed from
player to audience to player like a
volleyball. Words form the basis
of this presentation, their struc-
ture and release express hidden
needs and desires. They are
examined from the birth of
thought to expression of that
thought to interaction with the
thought until meaning is grasped
and response is made.

To try and classify or categorize
this production in any manner
would be futile.‘ Each individual
comes away with personal emo-
tions evoked and different im-
pressions of this alternative to
standard theatrical forms. How-
ever certain aspects of “Meas-
ure” bear further examination.

Director Trudy Scott stresses
that this is a work still in
progress. In fact, new scenesare
being inserted for this weekend's
performance.

Ultravox Offers
Spaced Out Rock

ByJlMFARERI
Pitt News Staff Writer

Ultravoxl the group, is five young
Englishmen who look and sound as
if they’ve been robotized by
invaders from another universe.
Lead singer-composer John Foxx,
with his shiny-vinyl overcoat, tall
sculpture-like frame and perfectly
square chin, is about as robot as one
can get without being nuts and
bolts.

“Ultravox!” the album, is an
excursion into spaced-out schizoid
rock; 40 minutes of sound that
would convince Anita Bryant God is
dead and dementia is around the
corner. Music that is conceptual-
ized somewhere between a night-
mare and suicide.

Much of the album is common
rock rhythm dressed up by producer
Eno, lyricist Foxx and a variety of
playing variations thrown in by the
musicians. One should witness the
stylized bass and guitar play and the
addition of violin and synthesizer.

A number like “Satday Night In
The City of The Dead” is old,
recognizable rock; but the way the
song is played—hard, crisp drum
work and fast, with bass up
front—is enough to make it as good
as new. These regenerated rock
songs prove the improved can be as
potent as the fresh.

Of course Eno’s presence, as
producer and, obviously, advisor, is
responsible for much of what is
exceptional about the album. Out of
the studio and minus Eno, Ultravox!
might not be so enticing.

Besides other rock numbers, like
“Wide Boys,” “The Wild, The
Beautiful, and the Damned” and
“Life At Rainbow’s End,” there is
“The Lonely Hunter,” which with a
few production and execution
changes could be a successful K.C.
and the Sunshine Band disco tune.

 -. .«Thex;e is.a1so.‘~‘Slipa.way.-.” with.~a~.

dilluted calypso beat, and ‘ ‘Danger-

ous Rythm,” the best song on
“Ultravox! ” by virture of its clever
structure and haunting guitar work.
But the most interesting numbers
are the two cosmic ballads that
come at the end of each side;“My
Sex” and “I Want To Be A
Machine-" They are eerie,
unnerving and full of the imagery of
a delerious dream world. Foxx is at
his inhuman best when he sings “I
Want To Be A Machine,” sounding
sincere and frightening. His lyrics
on these two tracks, as well as on the
whole album, are image-poetry
successfully depending on wild
associations for their odd ‘ ‘appea . ’ ’

Grateful Dead

NewA lbum Plays Smoothly

By PHILIP SCALAMOGNA

The Grateful Dead
Terrapin Station
Arista

Grateful Dead fans listening to
“Terrapin Station” for the first time
will be shocked, to say the least.
They will look at the members of the
group to make sure they're the
same, and wonder if they’re
actually hearing the Dead. The
music will be a style completely
different from the heavy rock-blues
they’re accustomed to, and they
won’t believe it.

“Terrapin Station” reveals the
Dead’s movement to a new
progressive sound. It will surprise
people, and only time will tell if
people will like it. “Terrapin
Station” is not a great album, but is
worth listening to.

‘Estimated Prophet”, the al-
bum’s first cut, has an easy beat and

iiteinpio‘ * good -i/ocaliiirrg an‘ d ‘decent '

“The production involves
thoughts and visions on the world
of the play which is the world of
Shakespeare, our world, the
theater, the actors, Shakespeare’s
time, our time and thoughts and
visions on the world within the
play which is the narrative
provided by Shakespeare,” Scott
said.

.“All of the words of the play
and of all languages were created
for communication and they
fulfilled a need at that time which
was expressed through some
other means of communication.
We also have to keep in mind that
“Measure for Measure” is a
comedy written in the middle of
tragedies. It is a transition play, a
dark comedy.”

The four actors in the produc-
tion are given a free reign as far
as parts of the play go with the
amount of improvisation depend-
ing on how freely the actors are
interacting with each other that
night. The presentation consists
of three parts with a musical
interlude between the first and
second and Shakespeare’s com-
ments between the second and
third.

Part 1, Isolation, dealt with
language as processes which
appeared to ﬁrst go through
instant replay and evolved
through garbled speech at. differ-
ent points to coherent thoughts.

The Pennsylvania Repertory Theater’s current producton “Measure Still For

     

Measure” stars (from left to right) Fred Miller, Lisa Mertz, Pat Buckley and An-

ne B. Wyma.

Part II, Confrontation, con-
tained wooden pieces strategically
placed on the acting surface and
the basic conflict of truth and
justice was acted in the candle-
light as if it were a chess game.
The steady rhythm and beautiful
diction of the principal characters
Isabel (_Anne B. Wyma) and
Angelo (Fred Miller) in the
Shakespearean speeches built the
tension as the confrontation
displayed the equality between
the two characters.

Part III, Betrayal, expresses the
betrayal of Isabel’s virtue by her
brother Claudio, who values life
more than honor or his sister’s
self-respect. A screaming Isabel
rebels against this betrayal, and
then the actors revert back to the

instant replay formula to slow\
down the action and end the woiﬁ; ‘

Lisa Mertz, one of the
principals, reminds us that a
Shakespearean play was termed a
comedy because the ending sees
the main characters remaining
alive.

“Measure Still for Measure”
will be performed on October 7, 8,
9, 14, 15, 16 at 8:00 p.m. at the
Lion Walk Center. '

Lion Walk is made up of more
than the Pennsylvania Repertory
Theater. Tai Chi classes, poetry
classes and poetry exchanges are
continuing events at the center
which encourages expression and 
performance of all arts. Pho (L (
graphy, drawings and sculpture
are exhibited.

LeCarre ’s New Spy N ovel

By PATTY TASCARELLA
Pitt News Staff Writer
The Honourable Schoolboy
By John LeClm‘e
Alfred A. Knopf
If for nothing else, John Le Carre
will be forever credited with raising
the spy novel from a trendy,
glamorized bit of escapist reasoning
to a realistic piece of literature.

guitar work. It keeps up nicely with
the beat. Tom Scott’s sax gives the
piece an easy, blues sound quite
different from the Dead’s typically
harder, acoustic sound. “Passen-
ger” brings back a little of the old
sound: the strong, heavy beat and
Vibrant guitar. It tends to become
repetitious, but it’s not bad.

“Dancing in the Streets” (How
many people have recorded that
song?) is a rather bad attempt at
disco. It seems every group fallskto
the temptation of trying out disco.
But the Dead are not cut out for it.

“Samson and Delilah,” based on
the Bible story, sounds all right but
the lyrics are rather trite. “Sunrise

guitars and keyboards are mixed

nicely. Once again, a different

The second side consists of seven

Starting with “The Spy Who
Came In From The Cold” and
climaxing in “The Honourable
Schoolboy,” Le Carre has steadily
progressed, substituting believable
cases and circumstances for the
usual James Bond heroics.

Like the Bond series, ‘ ‘The
Honourable Schoolboy’ ’ deals
with a continuing character-

a Fan”, exhibits an easy rhythm

and blues beat with a fresh-sound-
ing acoustic guitar.

“Terrapin Station,” ‘ ‘Terrapin’ ’
and “Terrapin Transit” all are
blended together; one tune pro-
gresses smoothly into the other.
Here again, something new for the
Dead--orchestral arrangements by
Paul Busckmaster run throughout
this side. It doesn’t sound bad; the
mixture of strings and brass and a
strong beat produces an interesting
sound.

The album continues like a story
with “At a Siding,” which is typical
Dead. The last two selections,
“Terrapin Glying" an‘d “Refrain,”
display much of the same sound.
The strong beat accompanies the
orchestral background of brass,
strings, and a few Woodwinds.

“Terrapin Station” is not bad,
but it’s still rough in some areas.
Only time will tell if the Grateful
Dead will continue in this style, and

George Smiley, who first appeared
in “Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy.”
Smiley is no suave playboy- he’s
pudgy, seemingly ordinary, and his
wife cheats on him.

However, Smiley is able to ﬁgure
out the most complicated plots, has
a sense of nobility and is a moralist,
despite the underhanded meihods
and dealings of the British'“§:-eretgz
Service. '

In “Schoolboy,” Smiley once
again is plagued by the Russian
agnet known as Karla. Smiley
manages to get his own network,
the Citcus, back into operative
condition and, through some
retaliation-geared research, finds
that a Hong Kong business man has
one-half million Soviet dollars in his
bank account.

If there’s a problem with
“Schoolboy,” it’s the al «too
obvious fact that Le Carre id z'ey__
his own creation. Smiley is an

engaging character, but he’s too’

all-hero for his own good and it
weakens the contrast with Wester-
by. Westerby, who is not so fully
drawn out, is the more interesting
character.

Smiley takes a jaunt to the Orient
to take on Karla and solve the
mystery of the money. Mean-
while, the circus puts a second
hero/agent on the case—Jerry
Westerby, a traditional Bolgd

type-agent who is the “honouralﬂ:;K,

schoolboy” of the title. But this is
no vehicle for a potential Redford/
Newman ﬁlm: in a surprise change
of pace, Le Carre puts Smiley and

A Blue and Gold descend on Florida

Field to meet the Gators.
Florida is a big play team that

gives its fans frequent cause for
heart failure but usually ends up
winning anyway.

Many of the Gators’ big plays

involve all-America wide receiver
Wes Chandler, who caught 44
passes for 967 yards and 10
touchdowns last year. that comes
out to 22 yards per reception, and
Chandler also contributed a nifty
13.5 yard punt return average.

But Chandler is not the only

big-play man on the Gator squad.

Florida runsgout of the wishbone,
and with the slew of swift running
backs on hand, it is easy to see
why. The entire starting backﬁeld

Jo Jo Heath Gets No Kicks From Punts

scored on an 80-yard romp in the
Gators’ thrilling come-from-behind
24-22 win over previously unde-
feated Mississippi State.

Halfback Willie Wilder, who lead
the Gators in rushing last year with
654 yards and a 6.5 average,
already has a 46-yard touchdown
run this year. Wilder was
averaging 6.9 yards per carry after
two games this season, while
Green has been producing at an 8.0
yard clip.

Starting quarterback Terry Le-
Count did not play that position for
three years at Florida, but when
last year’s starter accepted a
Rhodes scholarship with eligibility
remaining, LeCount received the
call.

He was a kickoff return man last
year (21 yards per return), and
passing is not his strong point—but
he is a big threat as a runner.
Against hapless Rice, he romped
for 52 yards on one play. and is
averaging 7.2 yards per carry.

Against Mississippi State, Le-
Count went from goatto hero. He
contributed handily to the Gators’
total of six fumbles lost and one
interception. He was shaken up in
the third quarter. and after the
Gators squandered a 17-0 lead, he
pleaded with the coaches to put
him in.

Head coach Doug Dickey ﬁnally
granted LeCount’s wish, and didn’t
regret the decision. Having been
unsuccessful with two other signal-
callers, Dickey went back to
LeCount, who redeemed himself by

LeCount reeled off two 16-yard

Freshman backup quarterback
Cris Collinsworth had his name
enshrined permanently in the
NCAA record books. In mopup
action against Rice, he connected

and ask Heath why he doesn’t like
doing something he statistically
excells at.

“You don’t get to handle the ball
all that much when you’re a punt
returner,” Heath explained. “I’d
rather be a running back. You get to
handle the ball more times that way.

“I enjoy running back punts when

I'm number one like I am now.” -

Heath continued. “But I'd still
rather be playing more at running
back. Running is something I enjoy
doing and, if] can do more of it, I'm

really happy.” _
Ueauctive reasoning tells you

that Heath, a quick-footed sopho-
more from Monessen, then is an
unhappy football player, a conclu-
sion Heath himself agrees with.

“It feels pretty good being
number one in the country and all, ’ ’
Heath said, referring to his top rank
among the national punt return
leaders. “It’s inspired me to try to
keep it up. But I know I would be
happier being a full-time running
back.”

So would many other Pitt running
backs, who feel that they too can
step in and get the job done at what
now is cluttered tailback situation.

With the first four games of the
season behind the Panthers, Pitt
head coach Jackie Sherrill has yet to
name the team’s full-time starting
tailback. “Fast Freddie” Jacobs
seems to have the edge heading into
Saturday night's important clash
between Pitt (3-1) and Florida (2-l),
due to his impressive 90-yard
showing against Boston College last
week, but Larry ‘Sims, Artrell
Hawkins, Steve Harris, Rooster
Jones and Heath all have proved
that they can run with the football.

don’t make them any longer.

On defense, the Gators are

Hutchinson. a 6-4, 244-pound
senior who had 14 solo tackles
against the Georgia Bulldogs. Pitt
center Tom Brzoza will probably
meet this tough foe Saturday.

ponent’s coach, as he tries to PSYCI1 YOU into
believing that your team, even on a bad day,
could whip the Oakland Raiders.

But the above reference to Hugh Green 18 not

t be taken as psychological warfare, nor was it
hitch by an opposing coach. The course was
none other than Panther head coach Jackie
Sherrill, and Green, his precocious defensive
end, is doing his best to frustrate anyone who
challenges Sherrill’s claim.

“Sometimes I’m happy with my game, but

usually I’m not,” Green said. “People have said
most of my games were good, but they don’t see
all the mistakes. I know I can improve.”

Like Sherrill, coach Jimmy Johnson, coor-
dinator of Pitt’s awsome defense, also found it
difficult to keep himself in check on the subject
of young Mr. Green.

wiugh’s been a very pleasant surprise for us,”
Johnson said greedily. “He’s got outstanding
talent, with speed, strength and quickness.
Hugh’s a very hard worker and we also like his
attitude,” Johnson added.
Green admits his attitude has been a key in his
development.

I’m basically a negative person,” Green said.
“I criticize myself and my game to see what I did
wrong. If I find out what I did wrong and then
correct it, Iknow I’ll improve.”

When asked how he found those weak spots,
Green said, “After practice, I always ask the
coach, ‘How do I look? What did I do wrong?’
That’s my negative side,” he chuckled.

  Pitt’s Defense Greener

Also on the negative side as far as Green is
concerned is weight-lifting; “I hate it!” he said.
Despite his opinion, lifting is a necessary, though
boring, evil that defensive ends must cope with if
they expect to contend with 250-pound offensive
tackles all day. In Pitt’s defensive scheme, the
ends—Green’s counterpart is junior Dave DiCic-
cio—must be powerful enough to play the line on
running plays, yet quick enough to cover tight

ends and running backs in passing situations.
Green intercepted his first pass for Pitt against
Boston College, and said he’s happy with his
present playing weight and the quickness it
allows him.

“If you lift and then put on weight, you got to
adjust until you get your quickness back to go
with the new weight. I feel good now because af-
ter I lifted all summer long, I worked on my
quickness and think I’ve adjusted,” Green said.

That Green has the quickness to match his
physical abilities is obvious to no one more than
Bill Hillgrove, who does the play-by—play for Pltt
football games. Hillgrove is a good and
seasoned broadcaster who can describe almost
any play smoothly, regardless of its complexity
or strangeness. Yet when Green, against Boston
College, vaulted over a blocker and, while in
mid-air, tackled the Eagle punter by 3PD1Yif1g 3
leg-scissors to his chest and pulling him down,
the acrobatic play left even Hillgrove speechless.
Green, meanwhile, was enjoying it.

“Games up here are more fun than in high‘
school,” he said. “Back there (home is Natchez,
Miss.), our coach always told us to be quiet and
just think and think and think about the game
coming up. I still think about our next game, but
not as much. It’s more fun now,” said with a
laugh.

Green, who was recruited by offensive line

coach Don Boyce and played offensive tackle in
addition to defensive end in high school, hopes
to move up another notch after completing his
career at Pitt.

‘‘I’d like to go pro if I get the opportunity,” he
said. “Of course, anybody would like that. But
I’m sure gonna try.”

Meanwhile, Green enjoys the people of Pitts-
burgh—“Everybody’s been real good to me up
here”—th0ugh notits unpredictable weather.

“It’s warm. right now in Mississippi,” Green
said on a day in the low 505 here in Pittsburgh.
“Here, I just stay inside as much as I can and
study.”

But on Saturday afternoon, Green’s outside
and in a class all his own. Ask Jackie Sherrill.

Pantherette Sophomore
Leads Gymnast , Cause

Anyone who has ever wobbled across a balance beam or had to

unwind himself from uneven parallel bars can appreciate Regina

Carson’s gymnastic skills.

At the kindergarten age of five, the Pantherette sophomore
gymnast began to learn and execute the required maneuvers of the

sport. Her mother and grandfather were both gymnasts, so
“gymming” was nothing new in the family.

In a sport where guts are essential, it is best to begin at an early

age. Gymnastics is an example of this. As Carson explained,
“When you’re young, you aren’t afraid of trying some new and
maybe dangerous trick, because you’re too dumb. The older you
get, the smarter you get and you say to yourself ‘Why am I doing
this?’ You don’t realize you could break your neck when you’re lit-
tle.”

Gutsiness is characteristic of Carson. Her Pitt coach, Donna
DeMarino, claims Carson never holds back. “She won’t cringe at
the thought of trying something new,” said DeMarino. “I’ll tell
her, ‘Regina, try this,’ and she’ll go right to it, no matter how dif-
ficult the trick may be.” ’

Women’s gymnastics is comprised of four events: the balance

beam, floor exercise, vault and uneven parallel bars. Although
proficient at all four, Carson’s favorite event is the beam. As a

high school freshman at Belle Vernon, she was Pennsylvania state
champion in this event. Competitors must execute their routine
upon the four-inch-wide‘wooden beam in a time span of about 1'/2
minutes.

The floor exercise is a series of twists, tumbles and flips. Per-
forming to music, this gymnastic endeavor also serves, Carson
said, as “an outlet for the athlete’s personality.” Vaulting is to
gymnastics what diving is to swimming‘. One must run toward a
thick leather support, or horse,” and spring forward, using the
horse as leverage to complete the vault.

Momentum is a factor in working on uneven parallel bars. This
event was glamorized in the 1972 and 1976 Olympics by Olga Kor-
but and Nadia Comenechi, respectively. ‘It was on this apparatus

that the judges decided Comenchi’s routine had been flawless.
They awarded her the first perfect score of 10in Olympic history.

Swinging from one bar to another, the gymnast strives to keep
moving, so the routine is a continuous motion without pauses or
breaks.

Once, while competing on the unevens in a high school meet,
Carson suffered a concussion when the set came apart and

collapsed. Since then, it has been a challenge for Carson to be

aggressive while on the bars.

While high school meets generally are competitions between
schools (Belle Vernon was undefeated during Carson’s four years
on the team), the intense individual duels ‘are found in the United
States Gymnastics Federation (USGF) meets. The USGF is regar-

ded as a stronger affliation than, for example, the Western Pen-
nsylvania Interscholastic Athletic League (WPIAL). Whenever
Carson competed in USGF competition, it was with the Monessen
BG’s team. »

To qualify for USGF national championships, one must work up
through a series of local, state and regional meets. Despite the dif-
ficulty in accomplishing this, Carson has qualified three times for
the senior nationals and once for the junior nationals.

In her first year at Pitt, Carson was high scorer (35.3) in the state
collegiate championship, and also earned the Pantherette MVP
award.

Because judges must decide the individual scores of each athlete,
gymnasts may not always agree with the rating given to their per-
formance. Carson claimed that for years, if she received a lower
score than she thought she deserved, it would psyche her out and
ruin her concentration for the remaining events. Carson would
rather not know her score.

“Now, whenever my score is announced, I just cover my ears—I
don’t want to hear it!” she declared. “Besides, I feel that it’s more
important that I’m happy with my performance, not what score
they give me.” ’

This season DeMarino has venturedlto say that her squad be
nationally ranked by March. . _

“I can't believe what talent we’ve got, what kind of team we’ll
have. Only 13 or 14 teams can qualify for the national champion-
ships and I believe we can make it! ”

Nine letter-winners return, while outstanding freshmen Myra
Bachuchin, Bonnie Tressler and Jill Morriswill team ‘with all-
around experts Alison Hoburg, Cyndee Severyn and Carson.

A home meet against Temple Jan. 7 will be followed by a Friday
13th clash with national power Penn State, led by Olympian Ann
Carr. This meet, predicted DeMarino, “will be bad luck...for
Penn State.” . I

Pitt will also host the regional championships in March. Because
of the tremendous amount of Eastern talent (Clarioniiand Penn
State were first and third in the country last year), the team that win
this meet -will almost certainly be favored to claim the national title.

  Pitt Netters Impressive

By CINDY NATALI

It rained in Pittsburgh last
weekend, but the Pantherette
tennis team brought back some
sunshine from the Eastern College
Tournament in New York by
ﬁnishing in the top 10.

Thirty-nine teams participated in
the event. the ﬁrst this season -for
the women. The team also added
to their record a 7-2 win over
Indiana University last Thursday.

Pitt totaled up 17 overall points
to clinch a spot in the top 10. The
team will be notiﬁed of its exact
standing when the results are
ﬁnally tallied. Both Maria Paris
and Janet DeCostro made it to the
third round and consolation
matches, which assistant coach
Erma Pytka thought was excellent.
Finishing seventh of 64 singles
players, Paris lost to the number
ﬁve seed in the third round while
DeCostro lost to the number six
player to place somewhere between
ninth and 16th.

The first doubles team of Janis
Irwin and Pam Bachman reached
the second round and consolation
matches. Jan Brownstein and
Nancy Bellistreri, the second
doubles pair, played well in their
first tournament together, but lost
to two tough teams and already are
looking forward to next year.

Pytka was pleased with the
team’s playing. “We should really
be up there next year,” she said.
“Every year we get better and
better.” .

A mistake in seeding disappoint-
ed Paris and the entire team. Ac-
cording to Pytka, Paris should have
been seeded seventh, but was not.

The players were seeded accord-
ing to what tournaments they had
played in and their wins. Pytka

claimed there were mistakes in the

seventh and eighth seedings—that
the player seeded seventh did not
warrant the position because she
had not won any big tournaments.
But, she confessed, “The judges
were very impressed with all of her
tournament play. The mistake
could have been made because
Paris had not played in as many
tournaments as the other girl.”

Paris proved herself worthy of
seeding by her play in the
Easterns. Because seeded partici-
pants are awarded more points for
overall play, Paris might have
ﬁnished sixth if she had been
correctly seeded (one point is
awarded for each win, with half a
point going to winners of consola-
tion matches). Although she made
it to the semiﬁnals and consola-
tions, seeding could have enabled
Paris to reach the quarterﬁnals.
She would not have met the tough
players she faced so early in the
competition.

The Pantherettes met a lot of
tough competition. Princeton, the
University of Virginia and Penn
State ﬁnished high in the stand-
ings. Kathy Mueler of Trenton

captured the singles title and
Princeton’s Sue Repogle and
Debbie Campbell landed second

and third places. A Virginia duo
clinched the doubles title ahead of
a runner-up pair from Princeton.

The women tromped their
competitors from Indiana in last

Bellisteri dropped her fourth
singles match to Sally Bissell, 6-7,
2-6. Playing the number ﬁve slot,
Pam Bachman lost a tough match
on a 5-4 tiebreaker to Sue Danjou.
“Bachman should have won,”
Pytka said. “She had it to the very
end and lost it in the tiebreaker.”

Setting the pace for the doubles
competition, Paris and DeCostro
downed Mistrik and Bissell, 
6-1. Irwin and Bachman followed
with a 6-1, 7-6 victory over Danjou

TAMPA, Fla.——There currently
are four members of last year’s
national championship Pitt squad
making a living in the National
Football League. The one who is
making the most money, and
getting all the publicity, is named
Tony Dorsett. Only one of the four
earned a spot in his starting lineup,
and his name is not Tony Dorsett.

Cecil Johnson. who starred at
defensive end for the Panthers the
past four years, is a starting

backer for the Tampa Bay
uccaneers.

Because of people like Johnson,
jokes about Tampa Bay’s ineptness
are disappearing rapidly. The
Buccaneer defense proved they can
play in any league Sept. 24 when
they held NFC champion Minnesota
to one touchdown in a 9-3 loss (The
Vikings also scored a safety).

Johnson was passed up in the
NFL draft, but about nine clubs

inviting him to try out as a free
agent.

“I was upset because I didn’t get
drafted,” Johnson recalled after the
Viking game. “But I’ve always
‘eyed football, so I ﬁgured I'd
give it a shot at making the pros. I
ﬂew to Philadelphia ﬁrst, and the
next day I went to Tampa. I said to
myself that if I'm going to get cut, I
might as well not have to travel too
far to get home.

“I never expected to start,” he
added. “I came expecting to make
the specialty teams.”

Though virtually ignored in the

Buc press guide, Johnson became a
starter by the time the first
exhibition game rolled around, and
he has been there ever since.
Ironically, he rarely plays on
specialy teams.
John McKay’s 3-4-4 defense,
J ohnson’s linebacking chores do not
vary too much from his past
responsibilities at Pitt, where the

this position,” Johnson said. “I'm

WVU, Fall To
lilittany Lions

By MARIA SCIULLO

It definitely rained a lot last
Saturday morning and just as
deﬁnitely, Penn State once again
defeated Pitt in cross country. As
of Friday, both matters had been
up in the air.

Although they lost to the Nittany
Lions, 22-37, the Panthers did
come through with a 23-32 victory
over West Virginia University.

For Pitt, Dave McDonald led the
way for the second week in a row,
ﬁnishing second to John Ziegler of

._ . Ziegler’s time was 31:19.
Mel Boyd was fourth overall; Gary
Siriano, llth; Mark Studnicki,
13th and Tom Herrmann, 16th.

With part of the race held during
a cold rain, there was little chance
anyone would break Nick Martin's
1975 course record of 30:33.

Assistant coach Dan Sullivan
described the PSU strategy that
won the meet: “They kept about
four to seven of their runners
bunched together. Our pack, on
the other hand, was too spread
out."

 A The Pitt squad won't compete

 ain until Oct. 15, when they will

attend the Marshall Invitational.

Sullivan will use the extra practice
time for workouts, which will add
up to more than 120 miles a week.

cornerback, and he's long on almost
» every play."

Tampa Bay should not get blown
out much anymore, but the
morbund offense will keep them
from winning many games. This
will be Johnson’s first losing season
in football, as his teams at Jackson
High and Pitt always were big
winners.

“It's similar to Pitt in that we’re
building up,” said Johnson, trying
to explain the frustration of the
Buc’s lack of offense.

Another similarity is the presence
of a consensus all-America running
back. Johnson is the only player to
have been a teammate of Tony
Dorsett and Ricky Bell. Dorsett and
Southern Califomia’s Béll were the
two pre-season candidates for the
Heisman Trophy last year, which
Dorsett literally ran away with.

‘ ‘I called Tony the other day, and
he was telling me what they’re

“going to do to us (in yesterday’s
meeting),” said Johnson. “Me and
Bell and Tony are good friends.

Johnson had an interception in

Pele Bids Farewell To Soccer 
In Front Of 75,616 at New York

EAST RUTHERFORD, N..l. (AP)
—The children brought white
ﬂowers to Pele, who stood on a
platform in the center circle of the
field at Giants Stadium last
Saturday. He held their faces in his
hands and he kissed them all.

To them he leaves his legacy, the
soccer throne he has abdicated to
youth. Later, he admitted, “I died
a little bit today.”

At halftime of his farewell
exhibition game, Pele stood in the

drenching rain that fell from the
skies as the tears had ﬂowed from
his eyes. A few feet to his left was
his father, whose ambitions of
soccer greatness were cut short by
the need to feed a growing family
in impoverished Tres Coracoes,
Brazil, so many years ago.

Pele peeled off the Cosmos
jersey he had worn so proudly for
three years and handed it to the
man they called Don-dinho.” As
75,610 people cheered and the
world watched, father and son
embraced. '

This was Pe1e’s farewell to the
game he has played for 22 years.
And this was the people’s farewell
to him.

Heavyweight boxing champion
Muhammad Ali stood not far away
as Pele addressed the throng
before the game. “I want to ask
you, because I believe love is the
most important thing that we can
have in life—peop1e, say with me
three times: Love! Love! Love!”

Later, when the ceremony and
the game were over, Pele recalled
the moment. “When I was talking
about love, when I looked at
Muhammad Ali and he was crying,
I knew we were equal and
brothers.”

Pele has made everyone his
equal in his years of unsurpassable
achievement. Saturday, his equals
came to say thanks. He sent some
away with a smile, some with a tear
but everyone with a goal-the

1,28lst in his 1,356 games. Playing
for the Cosmos team he led to a
North American Soccer League
crown in the season just completed,
the 36-year-old superstar scored on
a 30-yard free kick at 42:26 to
highlight the afternoon’s competi-
tive proceedings.

In the second half, Pele played
for Santos of Brazil, for whom he
had played 1,114 of those games
and scored 1.090 goals. He
couldn’t duplicate his scoring feat,
but that—and that the Cosmos‘ 
the exhibition 2-1 in his last
game—didn’t much matter to the
crowd, which included Jeff Carter
of the first family, former Secretary
of State Henry Kissinger and rock
star Mick Jagger.

What mattered to them was a
last glimpse of the inner man
whose accomplishments are leg-
end. What mattered to Pele was
that he ended his career as a
champion.

“The worst moment in your life
is when you finish your career,” he
said afterward. “But the highlight
is when you can stop when you
want.. Some players can’t stop
when they want because‘ pf
money.” " I

Penniless when he started,
prosperous when hestopped, Pele
steps aside. He has “unretired” in
the past, but this appears to be it.

With a ﬂood of love and a deluge
of tears, he leaves to youth the
inheritance of sportsmanship and
excellence.

Stickwomen Penalized By
Powerful Indiana (Pa.), 1-0

By KATHY KELLY

A small crowd looked on in
anticipation at Pitt Stadium last
weekend as the young Pantherettes
fell to the powerful Indiana (Pa.)
Indians in their season opener. 1-0.

From the beginning. Pitt was on
the attack. keeping the ball in
Indian territory for most of the first
half. But a breakaway by an
Indiana right wing. the ball
dropped deep into the Pitt defense
and was swept into the cage before
the Pantherettes could recover.
giving the Indians lead with 15
minutes to go in the half. 1-0.

The remainder of the half‘s
action was back and forth. with all
scoring efforts to no avail.

After a slightly extended half-
time rest. the Panterettes began

the second half with a fury. trying
to even the score. But when the
ﬁnal whistle blew. the count had
remained the same. 1-0.

The Pitt offense. with exception-
al play by team captain Cindy
DiGiaccomo. put two goals into the
cage in the second stanza. l—i@»l)<:>;' s
were called back due to penalties.

Although the Pantherettes lost.
they proved they are tough and
without a doubt improved over last
year—their initial year——when Pitt
fell to Indiana 10-0.

The loss did not damper their
winning spirit. as the team already
is looking forwared to Saturday's

By 1965, a following had developed
around J. R, R. ToIkien’s “The Hobbit,"
and the Trilogy of the Rings. At that
point, the Ring Trilogy had become an
all time best seller. At the end of 1966,
it outsold “Catcher in the Rye” by J. D.
Salinger, and “Lord of the Flies” by
William Golding, in college bookstores.
College students, particularly, were
caught up in its myths and its legends.
And so, the Tolkien cult was born...

When Tolkien died in 1973, he left
behind a partially finished major work
about Middle Earth, “The SilmariIlion.”

His son, Christopher, was left with the
task of re-working and consolidating the
book. Meanwhile, Tolkien cultists
waited breathlessly for the fulfillment of
their dreams of Middle Earth.

“The Silmarillion’s" recent entrance in-
to the literary world has been quiet.
There have been no brass bands, and
no conventions to herald its arrival, but
nonetheless the book has rocketed to
second place on the bestseller list in
only three short weeks.

As a celebration of “The Si|marillion’s”
arrival, and to honor the legend of Mid-

die Earth, Fifth Avenue would like to
dedicate this issue to ‘The Silmarillion,"
and to fantasy. With the creation of the
hobbits and the other creatures that
inhabit Middle Earth, Tolkien has
opened the doors for those who still
believe in unicorns and wizards.

This week’s cover story, “The
Silmari|lion,” is a review of the book, and
a commentary on To|kien's visionary
accomplishment in the creation of the
characters and legends of Middle Earth.
To introduce this Tolkien magic, Fifth
Avenue brings the reader a brief com-
mentary on the psychology of fantasy,
to be found on page 5. We also invite
you to take note of the exclusive inter-
view with Aragorn, King of Gondor, to
be found on page 8. —L.R.

. . an old hobbit was off by himself for a stroll near the western borders of the Shire. The trees about him hung heavy
with age, and he seemed equally bent from the scourge of time. He carried with him a large, grey tablet, inscribed with
many lines. The day's waning sunlight spedded the ground about him, and the wind rippled softly through the branches
above. The hobbit halted under an especially large oak tree and lowered himself to his knees. The roots of the tree broke
the ground and made numerous defts in the earth. The hobbit gently lowered the tablet under the oak’s largest root, whidi
was quite large. A ﬂat rock nearby he placed over the hole, and filled in the gaps with earth. The sun was a shining red gobe

Middle Earth

Something caught his eye beneath the roots of one particularly large tree. It was a grey tablet of stone. . .

By Ron N yswaner

The bus comes and nearly leaves
before I realize it’s even there. I've been
sitting in the dark, near a church on
Ellsworth Avenue, waiting-—here but not
really here. While the cars and bicycles
have passed by, I've lit a cigarette or
dusted my glasses—performing to hide
the more interesting things happening
inside. In a short half-hour at the bus stop
l’ve met friends and made love, written
great novels and survived painful affairs.
l’ve been near to death over and over
again.

My fantasy is a remote and silent
interior film that plays on through the
details of my life. It is an acting and re-
enacting of exaggerated confrontations
and farewells. Friends and the famous
pass through my mind on their way to
newer and better places, loving me or
hurting me with greater intensity than is
found in the real world. Fantasy is the
part of my psyche reserved for ideal
situations and heroes; some handed to
me by a pervasive popular culture, others
born in the situations l alone have known

' and seen.

The art of fantasy is an art of providing
heroes. We need not look far for an
ovenivhelming example: George Lucas’
science-fantasy film, “Star Wars,” was a
phenomenal success, and not
surprisingly. Lucas has given us back our
dream objects. With Luke Skywalker and
Princess Leia, we have found again role
models whose struggle is adventurous
and whose choices are always clear.
“Star Wars” audience is tired of Marlon
Brando’s confusion and Ingmar
Bergmann’s ambiquity—-—we want our
John Waynes and Amelia Earharts. With
“Star Wars” and with “Rocky," we are
assured that good often wins, and that

j” ﬂiers are clearly ‘defined “good men”

and now, “good women.” Our fantasies
are revitalized and reshaped; they have
become hopeful again.

Much of fantasy and the art that feeds
(and feeds upon) our fantasy is an
escape in that it entertains. Waiting for a
bus is boring, so without taking a step I
travel to a bar and meet a perfect lover.
The people I know are limited, so I create
involved and exciting ones to play with.
But‘ there is much more than the
interesting and wonderful in our fantasy.

here too are the boring, commonplace

routines we inwardly repeat. We hurt
ourselves in fantasy and often hurt
others, and we revive painful situations
and then reconstruct them, over and
over, in our minds. lf fantasy were simply

escape, wouldn’t we
behind?

So, if we do take our pain with us, it is
invalid to dismiss fantasy art as escapism.
Professor Phillip Smith of Pitt’s English
department sees this reaction to fantasy
literature as “an oversimplification.”
While he concedes that some writers
‘intend to “extend a sense of wonder”
with the worlds they create, there is, he
says, “a great deal of fantasy that is
a|legorical—that attempts to make a one-
to-one correspondence” that travels from
the art to the reader and back to the art-
work again.

Fantasy is, of course, concerned with
good and evil, but then, what literature
isn't? People often expect fantasy to
offer only black-and-white distinctions of
good and evil—such as cowboys and
Indians or Americans and Russians—and
in doing so remain distant from the reality
of our lives. Good fantasy, Smith asserts,
is not so simple. “There are doubts,” he
says. “Frodo (of Tolkien’s Middle Earth)
is not a self-confident" hero always
winning battles...there is good fantasy
that makes extensions.”

It is possible, according to Smith, to
release our assumptions to a fantastic
world, and then to come away from that
world with these assumptions, and our
perception, altered. Perhaps after
reading Tolkien, Homer, Milton, Poe, or
the bible, we come away viewing the
world differently, perhaps more clearly. in
this sense, fantasy art might be an arena
in which to explore and create freely,
since rules can be stretched or even
discarded. From this arena we
can come away with new ideas, or at
least, with former ones affirmed.

To dive into fantasy is often to
turn inward, to indulge and ex-
plore. I see myself as hero or
martyr, and for a moment I en-
joy the applause and
adoration. Then my fantasy
pushes on to images of
violence or domination; it
begins to examine some
needs and fears.

Unfortunatly, I am
equipped with an arsenal
of defenses. The one I

Fantasy: Images of Inner Lives

If there is a division between fantasy
as escape and fantasy as relevant
thought, the division is muddled. The
significance we give to fantasy art
comes from significant themes in our
own lives: we look for good in the
world, we need to feel there is good
inside ourselves. Fantasy can explore
and affirm our hopes, and in this wa
change our lives. _. - ' '

civilization has always valued rational,
goal-directed thought more than interior
exploration. We have said: Fantasy
does not solve problems. It is not impor-
tant.”

Currently, the trend to turn inward has
encouraged fantasies, particularly sexual
fantasies, to be explored. We are
beginning to reattach importance to our
inner lives (This is not all new, of course.
Much of psychodynamic theory is based
upon fantasy and the dream). In this age
of introspection, we are beginning to
recognize the importance of inner thought
that comes from our daily experience.

Klinger does not consider fantasy to
be something we turn on and off but
rather continuous cognitive
process that merges at night
with the dream and in
childhood with play. He
sees fantasies as
responses to the world,

    The Silmarillion

 

By Matthew Kennedy

The Silmarillion

By J.R.l-‘l. Tolkien
Houghton Mifflin Co.
$1 0.95

 great watch taken about the literary
world has ended with the publication of
John Ronald Reuel Tolkien’s last and
life-long work, “The Silmarillion.”

Long anticipated as the sequel to his
“Hobbit" and “Lord of the Rings”
trilogy, “The Silmarillion” immediately
establishes itself as a fulfillment of
Middle Earth, the world that sprang to
life in Tolkien’s earlier works. ‘

As the book chronicles the history of
Middle Earth from the Creation through
the passing away of magic at the close
ofthe Third Age, there is a depth and
secrecy to “The Silmarillion” that draws
the reader into its pages with the power
of unfolding fate and evolving destiny,
coloring the pale shadow of our real
world with shades of wonder.

It is a fortunate grace and a tribute to
Tolkien that the power of his life’s work
continued after his death in 1973, and
that his creation slipped through the
gglltl h gt Tolkien’s own mortality. The
s In at lil§ meals satin, euen a
splendid and delicate mesh, can still
breathe, alive, in our hearts.

The words of “The Silmarill-ion”
-shape some of Tolkien’s most
awesome, terrifying visions,
surrounding the reader with such a
feeling of wide landscape and historical
drama that the work seems less a work
of our time than a cryptic tablet found
under a mountain. it is the believability
that only a truly massive literary effort
can hope to instill; a work of fiction that
crosses the boundary of mere
suspension of disbelief and even raises
itself to be an alluring alternative to our
present history.

And if you read this stuff no further,
please accept this advice: take up this
last and overwhelming opportunity to
add your life to Tolkien’s creation’s life,
and, by reading it, find yourself as a
vessel and wanderer in Tolkien’s Middle

Earth.

While “The Silmarillion" is the last
published work of J.R.R.
Tolkien—brought together by his son,
Christopher Tolkien, from notes—it is
actually the bedrock upon which
Tolkien’s earlier works’ “The Hobbit”
and the “Rings" trilogy, rest.

“Founding work" is the best descrip-
tion of “The Silmarillion,” which
Christopher Tolkien reminds us is simply
a compilation of a far more vast foun-
dation of supporting literature concer-
ning the history of Middle‘ Earth,
revealed through the myths, poems,
songs and stories completed in
Tolkien’s life.

Work on "The Silmari|lion" began in

1917, after Tolkien’s return from the

French trenches of World War I, during
which the England of his youth and
many of ‘his friends were shoveled into
the furnace of the war machine and
consumed.

The work over the intervening years
gathered its own life from the hands of
its author, becoming such a fixed body
of truth for Tolkien that often, instead of
editing contradictions and errors, he
took to studying the manuscripts to
discover why indeed the contradictions
emerged.

He attempted to have
Silmari|lion" published after the success
of his “Hobbit,” but found publishers
leery of such a strange, almost archaic
tome. Yet the work continued to
change under the hand of the author,
and through its own inertia became the
backdrop to the “Rings” trilogy.

“The Silmaril|ion” that comes to us,
belatedly, in published form is an ac-
count of the origins and history of Mid-
dle Earth: the creation of elves, men
and dwarves; the rise and fall of the
First, Second and Third Ages, and the
supremacy of man and the waning of

‘ magic.

For the reader, fan or student of
Tolkien’s “Hobbit” and “Rings” trilogy,
“The Silmarillion” is not just a
mythology, but also a revelation of the
mysteries and secrets that lent those
later works such majesty and richness.

This book also has profound im-
plications for the understanding of
Tolkien’s life work as well, and so “The
Silmarillion” is also a consecration of the
literacy craft and ranging genius of the
man; a testament to the importance of
all his works, standing independently
yet bound up with what has emerged as
Tolkien’s New Mythology.

“The Silmarillion" is comprised of five
sections; the two with perhaps the most
immediate impact on any consideration

understanding the scope of Tolkien’s
achievement, they serve as only an
enticing first glimpse of the remaining
three books of “The SilmariIlion."

The first two books form a kind of
intricate golden box, from which, when
opened, spills such a blinding, fiery rush
of rainbow jewels that the hands freeze,
awash in the wealth.

aAfter the establishment- of the

universe in the Ainulindale and the
Valaquenta, Tolkien's tale turns to the
events of the First and Second Age,
often referred to in the "Rings” trilogy
as only a haunted memory, but here
shaped into life.

The last volume, Of the’ Rings of
Power and the Third Age, brings the
reader full turn to the era treated by
“The Hobbit” and “Lord of the Rings.”

The Quenta Silmaril, the Akallabeth
and Of the Rings of Power and the Third
Age are by far the richest designs of
Tolkien's founding work.

At their conclusion the reader is left

laifldrift in time and history, as if lost in

some we_athered ruin where the stones
whisper at night of their makers, their
glory and their glory's-doom.

The reader is immersed in such wide
and rolling views that the instinct is to
tarry here and there, pursuing first one
tale and then another. Each story is as
the polished facet of a great jewel; the
entire work an unwinding tapestry fired
with gems and crowded with history,
yet bound by a thread of fate and
prophecy, oath and curse, destiny and
creation’s fulfillment.

The Quenta Silmaril sets into motion
ggte great conflicts shaped by the

“Ainulindale and Valaquenta, telling of the
creation of the Elves, the dwelling of the
Valar, and the first, mighty wars against
the incarnate evil of Melkor the
Morgoth.

The tale of the‘ First Age revolves
around the shaping of the Silmarils,
three jewels that capture the essence of
the Creation’s spirit in their light and
design. The Silmarils are fashioned by
the Valar as indestructable vessels of
the world spirit threatened and nearly
destroyed by the first sallies of Morgoth
and his minions against the Valar and
their lands in his desire to lay claim to all
of Arda.

iﬁhe desire for possession of the
Silmarils awakened in Morgoth and in
the immortal Noldor, the race of elves--
and the curse that pursues the elven
king Faenor and all his sons--are just
part of the rolling tale.

For there we come upon the creation
of the dwarves;
Thangodrim; the pitted fortress of
Morgoth; the emergence of the Balrogs,
Orcs and men, and the rise of Gondolin,
the hidden city.

Here is the tale of Beren and Luthien,

 7’ first union of men and elves, and

their journey into the subterranean
fastness of Thangodrim to wrest the
Silmarils from Morgoth’s iron crown.
Here is the march of Morgoth’s hosts
against the elves and men of Middle

the rising of.

“New Myth fora Mo

Earth, the fall of Gondolin in treachery
and flame and the voyage of Elbereth to
the hidden realm of the Valar to seek
their aid in the salvation of the world
from Morgoth’s will.

Other characters and tales, of
tragedy and holiness rise up and move
within this awesome tale of contest, war
and destruction at the beginnings of
time.

Few words can describe the mastery
of vision exhibited in the Quenta Silmaril
except to say that Tolkien's words and
the history revealed and shaped in
those words are a challenge to the mind
and the heart, one which grows wider in
the reading.

The great wars over control of the
Silmarils’ spiritual light is, of couse, a
war over the spirit of the new world
Arda, for the Silmarils figure in the
desires of the heroes and evils of the
First Age, not just for their beauty, but
also for the source of that beauty, the
quintiessential essence of the universe.

And because of the continuing
thread of world purpose, prophesy and
curse throughout this complex
masterpiece of myth, the thousands of
individual tales each build on the other,
raising up new foundations, broadening
the mythical canvas and embellishing
the history of Middle Earth.

The close of the First Age with the
coming of the Valar out of the West to
the salvation of Middle Earth, the down-
fall and exileof Morgoth from the World,
are an incredible imagination of fire,
glory and cosmic contest. yet the close

of the First Age is but the beginning of

the Second, as related in the fourth
book of “The Silmarillion," the
Akallabeth.

In the Akallabeth we take up the fate
of the race of men who aided the elves
and Valar in their war against Morgoth,
and their reward for their services——to
dwell on a great isle where it is at times
possible to see land of the Valar in the
distant western horizon.

Yet the Valar have_ become even
more far removed from the world in this
age, and the men of Numenor, as the
island.is called, are forbidden to sail into
power matches that of Sauron, who sin-
East, where lies Middle Earth.

And so in the Akallabeth we learn of
the rise of the kings of Numenor, and
how they come to Middle Earth; first as
teachers, and later as tyrants, until their
poor matches that of Sauron, who
since the downfall of Morgoth has
raised his own designs for the control of
Middle Earth and the world.

The Akal|abeth’s central themes are
the rise and fall of the Numenorean
Empire, the twisted councils of Sauron
who comes to Numenor and captures
the mind of the king, and how, in their
pride and inflamed by Sauron’s
councils, the lords of Numenor

determine to make war upon the Valar in
hopes of gaining control of the lands
where death and corruption are
unknown.

The counter-theme is the struggle of
the Faithful, those who remain true to
the Valar, their persecution and their

The Silmarillion

By Dan Mulholland
and
Ron N yswaner

Majestic, and yet not pompous, King
Aragorn ll enters his suite at the William
Penn Hotel. I stand, surprised to see
that I am nearly as tall as one of Middle
Earth's most powerful and loved
rulers.

He eyes me and smiles, as if all the
attention embarrasses him. Offering a
bowl of Entwater, he leans back onto a
makeshift throne. His American tour to
call attention to the pop-culture co-
opting of J.R.R. Tolkien’s “The Hobbit”
and “The Lord of the Rings” has put him
before many other reporters in other
hotel rooms. He seems weary.

“Missing Middle Earth?” I ask.

“On shades of Sauron, yes. You,
know I haven't seen an elf for weeks?
Just people, in the bars, the
restaurants, all people. How do you
stand it?”

“We’re used to it, I guess.”

Seeing a chance to re-direct the
conversation, I say, “But we do have a
love for Tolkien. Too much, perhaps.
isn't that what your tour is about?”

At Tolkien’s name an eye twitches.
‘‘It is important,” he says, “that people
realize that Professor Tolkien did not
write those famous books; he merely
translated them. The real authors were
Bilbo and Frodo Baggins of the Shire.
Professor Tolkien stressed this often,
but few took him seriously.”

“And the Tolkien business has‘
boomed...”

.“Boomed?"

“Uh, expanded. Grown."

"Oh, that it has; much more than any
of us had imagined."

“And it disturbs you?"

“The bad things disturb me. I have
seen some Tolkien work that is quite
fine and would in fact, put the artisans of
Dale and Moria to shame. But then you
Americans have all the advantages.

, Think of what dwarves could do with

plastic. Leaping wizards, it would be
astounding."

For a moment he is traveling back;
the thought of dwarves has made him
homesick again. l wait respectfully and
then ask, “How bad is some of the bad
stuff you've seen?”

“Repugnant,” he says. “Abomina-
tions, resembling something that would

.0;

come from the foul servants of the
Enemy.”
“How do you like the calendars?”

He shrugs. “The idea has merit.
Ballantine books has done a fine job in
depicting the persons and events of the
Third Age. A mistake here and there, of
course. Personally, I like the 1974
scroll, the one Tolkien did himself. The
Tim Kirk calendar in 1975, and the
recent editions by the Brothers
Hildebrand are not so bad either. At
least they have a feel for Middle Earth.”
“How do you like their portrayal of‘
you?” "

Aragorn’s brow wrinkles and he
almost bristles. ‘‘I do not understand
why the Hildebrands insist on giving me
blue eyes. I do not have blue eyes. Do
these look blue to you?” he asks.

They did, but how, in good taste,
does one contradict a king? “Gray," I
tell him, nodding, “Definitely gray.”

As soon as he settles, I continue.
“What other products have you
sampled?”

“Well, they are quite numerous,” he
says. “For instance, you may not know
it, but at this very moment I am wearing
under my coat of mithril mail a T-shit’

the Three and the Nine which it
controls, and Sauron’s further
treacheries in Middle Earth against the
elves, men and dwarves.

The coming of Gandalf and the taking
of the One Ring from Sauron’s hand are
related here in detail as the historical
backdrop that haunts the pages of the
"Lord of the Rings” trilogy and even
“The Hobbit.”

The last book of “The Silmarillion” fits
the War of the Ring into its true historical

perspective, forging the last link
between the First and Second Ages and
the events of the Third.

In the ending of the Third Age, the
reader witnesses the passing of magic
out of the universe and the ascension of
mankind as ruler and arbiter of the
destiny of the world.

Such a vast spectacle of time and
history is found within the books
comprising “The Si|marillion,” and the
other works that form Tolkien’s New
Mythology that it inevitably raises
questions about the purpose and appeal
of the man's life-long labor.

The sheer vision of his creation
astounds. The breadth and depth of the
tale reduces the reader to an
infinitesimal atom, yet bears the reader
upwards, expanding, on the waves of
the tale's telling.

Tolkien as a man apparently presents
the archetypal contradiction of quiet,
dreaming student of dead language and
forgotten myth, jarring against the
unemcumbered spirit of an author who
conceived and energized an entire
universe. A man who built a mythology
as complete and as satisfying as any we
now look to in our culture.

Steeped in the essential truths of

Christianity and the ideals of western
culture, Tolkien was also a reknowned
student of the mythological
underpinnings of that culture. Yet while
he draws upon these sources for his
own mythology, he never echoes them,
but builds something fresh again.

The New Mythology of Tolkien
reflects a singular, motivating belief in a
purpose that shines through the entire
scheme of his universe, Middle Earth.

Discerning this element of purpose in
Tolkien’s history of Middle Earth, many
have come to slot the entire mythology
as sole pale Christian allegory; C.S.
Lewis with a sword, the whine of a
preacher behind Tolkien’s earth-
shattering battles, soaring empires and
dark, clutching terrors.

But the New Mythology is no
allegory. We have Tolkien’s word on
that, and his Creation passages that
demonstrate his word through literary
acﬁon.

Along with the basic questions of the
purpose behind the New Mythology is
the need for an understanding of its
sudden and sweeping acceptance in
this country, an acceptance that goes
beyond any superficial appeal based on
ideology, or rejection of technology.

This might be the least mysterious of
the questions confronting the reader of
Tokien’s New Mythology.

“The Hobbit” and the “Lord of the
Rings,” energized by the bedrock of
Tolkien’s mythology as published in
“The Silmarillion,” came to us at a time
when the founding mythologies of our
culture were wearing dangerously thin.
Two world wars, and a thousand years
of deceit, bloodshed and corruption,
have slowly and steadily eroded the
great truths and ideals of western
civilization into sterile rationales for th
designs of self-interest. A

Those long years of strife and war
that mark the history of the west have
seen religion turned to persecution,
patriotism turned to politics and profit:
science turned to nuclear weaponry,
rationality turned to bureaucracy and
truth to expertise. The great themes,
bedrock beliefs and founding principles
of our culture have gradually been
ingested over the years by the self-
interests of kings and the greed of their
servants.

And how clearly this decay must
have been shown to the young Tolkien
in the trenches of the First World
War—a war that extinguished the land
and life of England as he loved it,
herding his friends, his dreams and his
beliefs into the maw of a national war
effort.

it was after his return from the war
that Tolkien began the first few works
and sketches of what was to bloom into
a new mythology for the west, with a
fresh life and a new strength.

It was his intention to begin a new
tale of the beginning, another history in
which the truths and ideals of the world
he saw crumbling about him could be
preserved; not as just a museum piece,
but also as a vital, living, breathing
reality.

For that is why mythologies are
made, maintained and elaborated by
men and women; not only to simply
describe a culture's ideals, but also to
invest them with an independent life
safe from the mortality and corruptibility
of thinkers, dreamers and schemers.
Mythologies both enshrine ideals and
distill them, but in lending those ideals a
separate existence and vitality, lend
those ideals a power to arrest the mind

and the heart. Mythology gives them
their own voice in which to whisper of
the possibilities of mind and heart when

ideals and truths are given a home in our
spirits, and set spinning there.

That is w..¥ Tsltisn BS9lll§ Will‘ ills
own Creation, setting his New
Mythology apart from our world, free
from the twisting designs of kings and
their servants.

By striking out, alone, to spin a new
world and new races of man, Tolkien
could be assured of the safety of he
mythology from the acid winds of .
pogroms and jihads, our election
campaigns and war efforts, our rallies
and revolutions.

And yet, through the miracle of his
painstaking craft with words, and the
skill with which Tolkien weaves his tales
of sorrow and joy, we can look across
the gulf between our world’ and Middle
Earth. We can venture into the history
of Middle Earth and perceive there a
glimmering of our own potential, the
light of our own ideals that reaches out
of the pages to enfold us.

J.R.R. Tolkien and his works must
now be considered a gift come,

unlooked for, at a time of unspokenfise, .

need. .

In his world of Middle Earth, in the
clash of arms, and in the bitter losses
and white stone ramparts Tolkien has
handed back to us the germinal spirit of
our civilization, yet armored it against
our corruptibility. The New Mythology
of Tolkien captures the living,
illuminating essense of our culture in
words that glow with a warm light
rendered untouchable and
indestructible: that of his Silmaril.

editor, is a student of Tolkien ’s

for the most part he has failed to capture
the heroic spirit of those byegone days.
The same company, Caedmon, has
issued a three-record collection in
which Tolkien himself reads from “The

These are stirring renditons, and should
be in every collection. But by far the

would have thought that he once played

also two albums put out in the mid-
1960s by a group calling themselves
“The Hobbits.” This band had little

“The subject is important to me.

mention a few other items. There are
more calendars than ever this year. In
addition to the 1978 Ballantine wall

twelve paintings by Tolkien that have
been published elsewhere. There also
is a calendar based on the newly
released “Silmaril|ion,” but it has not yet
reached the shores of this fair land.
There is a chess setavailable for the

munificent sum of $120, in which the

He smiles. ‘‘I have not yet signed a

about this land that I do not understand.

back...”
“Home?”

He stops and stares out the hotel
window, looking past the U.S. Steel
Building. “You should have spent just
one night in the Great Hall of Riverdale.
There were feasts and long mysterious
tales being told and many, many elvin
songs. We never thought that any other
