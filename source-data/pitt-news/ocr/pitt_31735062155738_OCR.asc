Hit

Haryey Pope’s student dramats will -be trying for their

second hit of the current season Friday night when they open
with the James Thurber-Elliott Nugent comedy, ;‘The Male

Animal.”

_ The" play is primarily a comedy of life in a mid-western
college town, with the underlying serious theme of academic

freedom.

The comedy opens on the eve
of the homecoming football game
with Professor Tiirner and his
wife entertaining guests prior to
attending a school rally. Trouble
is brewing because Michael
Barnes, editor of_ the student mag-
azine, has written an editorial
praising Professor Turner as the
only liberal left on the faculty.

Before the party begins. Dean
Frederick Damon of the English
department calls to warn Turner
that his plan to read a letter of
Bartolomeo Vanzetti to his class
will throw the trustees into a
furor. A

The first guest to arrive is Joe
Ferguson, former football star, and
oﬁce a swain of Turner’s wife El-
len. He is an amiable extrovert,
completely wrapped up in athlet-
ics and puzzled by anyone like
Turner, who -is interested in

   

 

ideas.

Trouble erupts when Turner.
irritated by Trustee Keller’s blus-
ter, insistslthat he is going to
read the Vanzetti letter and adds
that a college must be concerned
with ideas. From this point on the
play moves into some very com-
plicated and laughable situations.

In the lead ro.le as Professor
Turner is Jay Dantry, sophomore
speech major. Dantry is a trans-
fer from Carnegie Tech Drama
School and has appeared in “Mr.
Roberts” at the Playhouse.

Lawrie Rosentiel will appear as
Joe Ferguson; Maurice Haidaker,
a transfer from King's College,
England, will take the part of
Dean Damon. .

Others in the cast - include
George Ann Bennet as Ellen Tur-
ner. and Nancy'Schwinn as Pa-
tricia. ‘~,_

Pi Sigma Alpha, national ‘political science honorary, is
being revived at Pitt. The campus chapter, dormant now for
about three years, will meet for the first time at 3:30 p.m.
on Jan. 13, in the Red Tuck Shop. .

At that -time 22 elected members, including 11 under
graduate and 11 graduate students, will chose their dfﬁcers.
Dr. Elmer Graper, head of the political science departrnent
willspeak on the purpose of the organization. Refreshmé'pts

will be served. .

Pitt's chapter of 151 sigma, Al- .

pha,-the lirst in this state, was
chartered in 1928. The fraternity
has 55 natignal chapte1"s..A‘c-
cording to Dr. William Seyler, as-
sistant‘ professor of political sci-
ence and faculty advisor 91' the
group, there are ‘three kinds of
members — students. including
both graduates and undergradu-

ates, faculty members, and alum-.

ni ‘members.

Students must be "either jun-
iors, seniors, or graduates. -They
must have completed at least 10
semester hours in political sci-
ence, including one . advanced
course. The Second requirement is
an average grade of B or higher
in these courses. ,

Notices have been sent, out to
elected members. A few of the
faculty members arevDrs. Elmer
Graper, H. N. Carroll, Albert. Mar-
tin, R. L. Branning, and J. S.
Gow, all of the political science
department.

Pi Sigma Alpha never lost its
charter here, but became inactive
a few years ago. Dr. Seyler is at-
tempting to “put some life into
it” this year.

One of the events kept up is
the annual award to an outstand-
ing senior majoring in political
science. At Scholar’s Day 2: vol-
umeis presented to this student.

‘From Taylor to Toujours

-Prof Mixes Magic

and Math

By, ANNA MAY BARTIROME

When Dr. James S. Taylor,
professor and head of the
mathematics dep a r t In e n t ,

practices his hobby, he uses magi- .

cal powers raised to the nth de-
-gree to entertain his observers.

In his leisure hours, Dr. Taylor
is a magician, assuming the iden-
tity _of Professeur J amais Toujours
of the Department of Thaumaturgy
of the College de Paris.

President of Tampa Ring

Though magic is merely a hobby
with Dr. Taylor, he takes a fairly
active part in magical organiza-
tions. He, was elected this month,
for the third time, to the presi-
dency of Tampa Ring 13, Interna-
tional Brotherhood of Magicians,

the Pittsburgh Chapter of a world.

wide organization of over 5,000
magicians. , \_

Besides, he is a member of the
Society of American Magicians,
whose local chapters hold regular
monthly meetings, at which the
members attempt to assist and
amaze each other with their feats
of prestidigitation and other forms
of wizardry.

Meetings Are Refreshing

“I ﬁnd these meetings and asso-
‘iciations very refreshing,” says Dr.
Taylor. “They give a much needed
change from my activities _at the
University and keep me from go-
ing stale. With the membership in-
cluding doctors, lawyers, dentists,
business men, industrial\ workers,

government employees, and even a‘

few professional magicians, I be-
lieve this variety of contacts en-
ables me to maintain a broader
view than might otherwise be pos-
sible, and thus» contributes indi-
rectly to a sounder attitude toward
University problems and plans.”
This past summer, when his piq-
..ture as Professeur Toujours adorn-

. ‘ed the University bulletin boards
for_several weeks announcing a~

performance, Dr. Taylor fooled

many people. He innocently asked magic. After he entered the Uni-

Miss Hope, Information Room

I ' Hostess, to arrange with Mr. Berry,

campus proctor, to-save several of
‘these posters on grounds that “Pro-
fessor Toujours” was his
friend. . ‘ _
Hides Behind Mustache

In his French disguise, few peo-

ple recognized the math professor.

‘ A week after the performance, one

of the faculty asked Dr. Taylor if
he had seen the famous French
magician.

Dr. Tay1or’s work is devoted
primarily to the geometry of the
complex domain. He is currently
writing a paper introducing the use
of projective coordinates into the
real representation in spaces of
four dimensions of the plane of
two complex variables.

He has also published works in
the ﬁelds of postulate theory,
mathematical theory of testimony
(correcting errors in this theory
committed bygthe late Sir Arthur
Eddington as well as by the late
Magnard Keynes), and the mathe-
matical theory of depreciation.
Professor Harold Hotelling, who
based much of his own later work
in depreciation theory on one of
Dr. Taylor’s papers, gave him
credit for presenting for the first

time, the only correct solution to

the depreciation problem.

as Professeur Jamais Toujours
of the Department of Thauma-

In his off hours, Dr. Taylor prac-

tices his magic hobby. He was
recently elected for the third
time as president of Tampa Ring
13, International Brotherhood of
Magicians, Pittsburgh chapter.

Master’s theses have resulted from
research problems that Dr. Taylor
has created.

Dr. Taylor became interested in
magic during his high school days.
At this time he was living in Cali-
fornia, where his father owned and

operated a moving picture and

vaudeville theater.

Later, he assisted de la Geneste,
the magician, during his engage-
ments.‘

From this magician Dr.-Taylor
received . his ﬁrst instructions in

versity of California, his magic
work was limited to appearances
as “stunt man” of the University

In 1919 he undertook a full-time

a and their newspaper. Matters bf

 

By Tim Kovur

Several college journalism departments and}

newspapers are currently circulating questionnaires
throughout the nation’s college newspapers in an
effort to discover the position of collegiate press in
today’s universities. Most of the questions deal
with the situations and attitudes found in the
school‘ in connection with the student 'journalists

policy, censorship,_ ‘coverage,
scope of editorial comment and
faculty supervision are the more
important phases of the question
sheets.

These same_ subjects were
thoroughly‘ hashed out in the
many convention meetings that
too place during this last year
and in conventions ofprior years.

But the very fact.that discussion is stm heated

after years of thought and argument, is ample‘

proof that the question is far from being solved
in the minds of many student editors. H "
It also suggests that they place great import-
ance upon the status of the college newspaper and
the purpose which it serves in the college.
Is There A Definition? _
Quite frankly, it is difficult to ‘deﬁne the exact
services provided by a publication. One can say
that it disseminates information throughout the

We know that certain'of the

. Indian tribes were unbelievably ,

wanton in their treatment of cap-
tives. Presents day atrocities of

— war are eclipsed by the horrors

which dwelt in the minds of such
tribes as the Apaches.
Knowledge Built Up f

A keen knowledge of the woods

and streams of his ‘native land

was indispensable to the Indian.
Still it seems logical that this
knowledge of nature was built
up over the centuries because of
a complete absence of technolog-
ical advancement. - '

 

A good example of distortion
of fact is found in the legends
which have spring up around the
life of Wil1iam>Bonny, alias, Billy
the Kid. Hollywood seems com-

pelled to produce two or three
epics of the West each year which
feature “The Kid” as their hero.
These, celluloid calamities. dej-
pict Billy as a sort of Robin Hood,
o‘f—th_e old:West, a ch‘an1pion"of,

womentand _an idol of children, -

aman who was kind to animals
and who killed to rid the world
of the “bad men” who plagued
the West. t

Facts Different ‘
The facts dictate, aslightly re-

versed image of Mr. Bonny. The ,

Kid was, according to reliable

biographers, a cad of the ﬁrst .

magnitude. Being the type who .
neverpassed up the opportunity
to shoot a man in the back, he
felt no qualms if his’ indiscrimi-
nate gunplay resulted in wounds
-to the fair sex and their young
offspring. /
Bringing the question closerfto
this generation, we ﬁnd that such
men as Teddy Roosevelt, George
Washington," and Thomas Edison
have been presented in a manner
which, although not false, simply
fails to tell the‘bad points as Well
as the good. - '
I Of course, the arguments will
range on either side of the ques-
tion and some will invariably as-’
sume a neutral position; but
what of our past president, H.S.T.
and his dealings with the late

,1-Iarry Dexter White? How will
these facts be_ presented in the '

history books of tomorrow? How
do you, asstudents of today, want
your children, as students of to-
morrow, to learn about the men
who shaped the United States of
America? -  . .

his own personality.

   

The members of the staff, besides their writing in

and mechanical contributions, effectively contribute

to the functioning of their paper by injecting shots"

of humor, pathos, temperament, judgment, knowl-
edge, and the many, other facets that determine an
individual’s personal characteristics and personali-
ty. ‘Readers andcontributors, by theirpvery exist-
ence, their likes and dislikes, their wants -and
needs, determine what a newspaper accomplilhes
or fails to do for the institution.

What Method?

And how does this fantastically complex con-
glomeration of talent and individual qualities bind
together to accomplish the task of putting a value

‘ scale on the coldly mechanical newspaper? .The

philosopher would have his answer, the psychologist

‘might have a different line of thought, and the Carl-

catured cynical journalist might have a third and
totally different idea. ; n
In fact, the answers would be as dissimilar as
the people who authored them and the problem
would remain unsolved. The status of the news-
paper would remain unchanged and the wheels of

fortune and fate would revolve as usual and the «

student journalists would convene next year with

their questionnaires and their many answers that

would be discussed and argued again and again.

Etiquette of Dancing-50 Years Ago . . . _

How Honest Are the It-|iis’r‘ory Books?

_By John Ney.

Last Monday afternoon, as I was helping my
girl friend move new bookcases into her‘ room,
I came -across a book which really gave me some
chuckles. The title’ or thebook‘ is “Dancing and
"Etiquette of Balls and Parties” and if you think
this generation is governed. by rules and regula-
tions just listen to a few excerpts from this little
“gem” published in 1902. '

On the proper way to enter a party the author,
a Miss Wilson gave this advice, “On ‘teaching the
"place where the ball or party is to be given, a
gentleman "first conducts his partner to the ladies’
dressing room and then proceeds to the gentlemans’
dressing room. V

Nixes Arm-In-Arm V
,“When ready to descend to the ball-room he
seeks his partner at the door ‘of the apartment

where .he_previouslypleft.;_her.” i-Soyfar it seems ..
fairly sensible," but this is only the meeknbegvin-.
_‘ning. To continue, “The lady invariably; enters

the ball-room in ‘advance’ of her i-escort. In NO

'- CASE do they enter arm.~in’arm.”- .What is horrible
wabout entering a dance “arm in arm” this writer

will. never understand. , _,

" But to__ go on -with‘ Miss Wilson’s advice, “A
gentleman is supposed to dancevthe ﬁrst dance with
the lady whom he escorted to see that she has a
partner for everydance in which she cares to par-
ticipate; to take her out tdsupper, and, in short
(did she say. short), to__see-that she‘. receives every
attention that can contributeto her pleasure.”

Two's 1'he.-|.imi-l- « . . .

In our modern age when a girl may danpe all
night with a man she has justmet, my little_book
tells me “A lady may grant the same gentleman

,two dances in" the course of an evening, but‘ he
‘is not at liberty wseasks. her" tor, a4third-?i-.How?s

they care to talk about this “ga‘y”

  

\ that for cramping. your style, ‘boys?’

*’ Now you may ask, didn’t_ they "even relax ac

. such simple function sas a square dance? Well,

what’s _in the’ book about ‘a good old fashioned

» square dance? “A person’s good s-breeding,’ or lack

of it, is perhaps nowhere more clearly, manifested
than in dancing a square dance.”

Mentions Confenfion \

“In forming’ ‘a set, while the position of head
couple is naturally most desirable, it should on no
account bef:.made the subject of contention. It in
far better to yield/one’s rights, than to argue
such a pofnt."‘ _ i O i

‘ “During the ‘intervals (now get this!) in which
a couple are not dancing, they are, of course; ski
perfect liberty to converse. -The conversation

should consist of _the ‘light and airy nothings’ which . it
'-entertain for the moment‘; and are for that reason
.—exactly suited to the occasion. ‘ '

It should never vbecome so absorbing‘ as to
render one ‘couple oblivous "to ;the‘. existence 01
others in the-set.” .

ably would make themiill to think about it.

So remember these little rules, girls, the next

‘.'time’ you go to a barn dance and mama tells you
n to be home by 1 a.m. and thank your lucky stars

(to use a cliche) that mama is not coming along.

‘And, men, when you’re out with your little dream-.

Bradley Sees

In Tokyo .

By GERRI ASH

Tired of waiting months for
a movie to come to the neigh-
borhood theater, of paying
high fares on streetcars, of the
lack of night spots‘?

Take ‘John Bradley’s advice and
get on the next ‘plane for Tokyo
‘where cab fares are as low as 25
cents a mile and there’s a choice
every evening of going to night
clubs, the legitimate theater, The
Comedy Theater, ballets, musicals,
operas and modern movies. A

“In fact,’.’ relates B r a d 1 e y,
‘ “From Here to Eternity” ’ was
playing to Tokyo audiences four
months before it hit our local
movie house in Brentwood.”

Spends Time in Tokyo

‘ John Bradley‘ of the geography
department spent 19 nbnths in To-
kyo as part of the Army Security
Agency. “Anyone interested in
teaching” explained Bradley “will
have his pick of jobs. Tokyo needs
50 per cent more teachers than
they now have. Furthermore you
need not know Japanese to qualify,
as English is taught along with the
native tongue. The only drawback
is the pay. Wages for teachers are
-based on the low tuition of $10 to
$20 per student per semester.”

« When Bradley’s wife joined him
in Tokyo, they hired a maid for $22
(American dollars) a month. The
maid. read English perfectly and
had recently received a degree in
economics. Yet \she made more
money as a domestic than she could
have in economics. «

Bradley added that almost al-
ways the only Japanese who earn
a decent living, according to our
standards are those employed. by
the occupational forces. 

The working class of Japan is

’ still literally in rags and the aver-

age Japanese income is less than
$600. Many an American house-
wife Bradley claims would appre-

ciate doing the housework of the

Japanese wife.

rice (very little cooking).

Still Japanese girls prefer Amer-
ican soldiers for husbands, he con-
tinued. Since the Army does not
encourage these marriages, there
is a lot of red tape before they are
approved.

If the couple decides to remain
in Japan they are usually accepted
because American Army personnel
are pretty well respected there,
Bradley explained. If, however,
they settle in the states, the bride
soon finds that the country estate
she has heard so much about is
just a rundown farm:

Japanese Cook With Gas

. Contrary” to’ what most people
think, Japanese cooking is entirely
different from Chinese cuisine, said
Bradley. The Japanese are not a

ﬂavoring. ~

[Tourney Attracts Three

o o I
Top-Ranking Quintets  
By DAVE MAZER ' 0
Although the Steel Bowl brings three nationally~spot‘-

lighted teams here, Coach Bob Timmons’ boys» still have one
favor to be thankful’ for-they only have to play two of

A
T

them.

The Panthers open the tourney
against Bradley Friday night and
face either Wake Forest or neigh-
boring Duquesne the following
evening. "

‘Most observers feel that Pitt
will luckily not have to battle
the highly-touted Dukes, though,
since this year the tournament is
round—robin style with the win-
ners and the losers meeting each
other the second night, therefore
giving little hope to an a1l-Pitts-
burgh clash for the championship.

Bradley, Michigan Equal
After the unsuccessful opener

at the Field House against Michi- ~

gan last Saturday and the tourney
coming this week, the Panthers
will have to pull through with an
upset to avoid starting the season
with three straight losses.
Questioned about the strength
of reorganized Bradley, a power-
house before the basketball scan-
dals, Timmons answered that
“they-should be about as strong
as Michigan.” The new head
teacher thought that Michigan
had good personnel. “We might
have beaten them’ if they hadn’t
had so many tall men.” «
Even though the Panthers fas
break didn’t click opposite the
Wolverines, Timmons believes
that, since this was the first game,
nervousness was a main factor in
the downfall. '
“‘ Deitrick May Start
Lineup -changes were in order as
the Blue and Gold returned to
practice, and Timmons indicated
that he may insert Dick Deitrick
and Joe Fenwick in the starting
quintet. The senior football cap-
tainpshowed up very well against
the ‘Wolverines with four ﬁeld
goals in as many tries and prob-

JOE FENWICK
Soph Regular

ably earned a starting berth.

Fenwick has been playing steady
ball in the workouts, and in the
short time he was in the tilt Sat-
urday, he garnered seven points. V

Otherwise, the lineup should
consist of Captain Dutch Burch of
011 City, Ed Pavlick of Johnstown
«Catholic, and Dave _Duesse1 of
Peabody. Pavlickand Duessel each
contributed 14 tallies to lead the
scorers in the inaugural.

Grid to Court
  ls Short   Hop

By RUSS FRANKE
Sports Editor

  

It didn’t take Dick Deitrick long to put in the clutch
and shift gears from football into basketball. With only a
week to shake Off the ,bumps and bruises contracted during
the long autumn grind, the 1953 grid captain cruised onto
the Field House ﬂoor Saturday night and shot like he owned
the basket. ~

During the short time he appeared in the Pitt lineup,
Deitrick popped in four ﬁeld goals out of four tries. He also
was charged with four fouls by the histrionic but capable
Red Mihalik within that short time, but the bespectacled
Danville senior;.neVer has been a model of ﬁnesse on the court.

Dick’s chief asset is determination, which he dis-
plays most effectively when he gets his big hands on the
ball, regardless of whether it’s a basketball or a football.
Only the oﬁicial’srwhistle prevents’ him from yanking

_ . out the arms of any opponent who would dare wrestle

him for the pill. p

Dick was not always a ball hawk, however. In high
school he started out playing in the band, but was allowed
to go out -for football if only to keep the name of Deitrick
on the school athletic roster. Needless to say, he made_out.

Last Saturday, wheii Captain Dutch Burch was lifted
for a rest Deitrick happenedto be in the lineup. The ref
came over to the bench to ask Coach Bob Timmons, “Who’s
your captain, now?” ’

“Deitrick,” Timmons answered.
The unspoken word “naturally” seemed to hang in the
-an: =3 =8 *
If you see anyone walking around town with green stripes
across ‘his back and adjacent areas; you will know him as
a Pitt basketball fan; Not that it is the -insignia of a new
rooter club. Some of the newly—painted seats on the west
end were not quite dry for the Michigan game.
A clever device for holding the crowd, at any rate.

News Sends Ballots ,
For/1 ll-America Team

The Pitt News Sports desk mailed out 600 ballots today
to college sports editors throughout the country to gather

the selections for the Pitt News All-America fooball team.
According to Carroll Cook, who: ~

‘man l’ve ever seen,-”

originated the plan andgis hand-
ling the maliing, all the various
schools should receive the letters
well before the Christmas recess.

The selections, however, will not
be made until all the post season
affairs and bowl games are com-
pleted. For this reason, the News
team isiexpected to be a more
valid representation than other
All-America teams which are pick-
ed before these crucial games.

Selection of a player—of—the-year
will be an added feature of the
balloting.

Every school which ﬁelded a

football team last fall is being
contacted, and the editors are ask-
ed to pick each player according
to their own opinions, regardless
of the size of their school or the
geographical location. With such
a large number of votes involved,
it is expected that the team will
balance out validly and representa-
tively. W

The results will be released
early in January, after the bal-

lots have been «returned and the

Votes tallied.

“He’s the‘ hustlingest big
says
Freshman Coach Carl Peter-
son Of the new frosh se.nsa-
tion, John Riser. V '

“Big man” is a conservative
sketch of the towering ﬁrst
year man who measures 6-4 from
the ﬂoor to the top of his crop-
haired head and tips the scales at
205 pounds.

Sinks 24 Tallies

As far as his “hustling” goes,
just take a gander at what the
Pre—Dent freshman did against
Johnstown Center Saturday night
before the Pitt-Michigan game.
Riser really rose to the occasion by
leading his mates to an 83-46 vic-
tory. He sunk eight ﬁelders and
an equal number of fouls fora
grand total of 24 digits for the
Panther Cub cause.

After his performance Saturday,
observers speculated that “Big
Jawn” may be the answer to the
Duquesne frosh’s little brother
combo of Ricketts and Tucker.
The young Panthers will meet the
Little Bluiﬁtes Dec. 1-7 at ‘ the
Gardens. _ «

Riser gives credit to his high
school coach for his basketball
ability. “Coach Will Laughlin
really showed me the ropes in
high school and I am indebted to
him for it,” says the appreciative
Riser. Washington High School" in
Washington, Pa. is the origin of
the big forward.

best shot, the jump shot, while

Charlie Chump was a scrawny Junior who never had any
claim to fame on campus. Then, one day, it became known
that he had become manager of the Fencing Team. Immedi-
ately he was surrounded by a group of incredulous students.

“How come you’re managing the Fencing TeamP", asked

one of them.

"Well, it's this way,” replied Charlie. “Inst week I went
down town and got a couple of Van Heusen VANDUROY

"Is that a fact,” murmured one of his classmates.

* "But then, all their boyfriends gathered ‘round and said,
‘Charlie, what would you do if we beat, you up?’ So I looked
‘em right in the eye and said, ‘I'll manage a defense!’ "

 “Gee, what happened?" asked awide-eyed Freshman.

“just then Angelo, coach of

the l?encing Team, walked by.

He said, ‘You managa dc fence. Atsa good, da teamsa need

 Reader’s Advisor Guide
To Library Knowledge

By ARTHUR

SEARS, JR. '

Miss Lorena A. Garloch, director of Pitt libraries, says
students are missing a wealth of free aid at Pitt. That aid
is the Reader’s Advisor, directress of the Pitt library card
catalog room on the ﬁfth ﬂoor of the Cathedral, and bearer
of general library information.

This college trained 1ibrarian‘A'
6 can helpstudents on general libra-

ry procedures and is especially
qualiﬁed in matters dealing with
the card catalog ﬁle. Students who
use term papers, speeches, and col-
lateral readings would be assured
of their technical and factual ac-

«curacy by checking the location

of materials with theadvisor.
For example, a student might
want to write a discussion paper
onthe legal controls imposedoii?
the family unit by its national or
ethic group. This student will

almost invariably check some of

the cards in sociological listings.
He would be right, but that is

not the only place information on

this subject‘can be found. The

student could check family list-1

ings, husbands and wife listings,
children listings, and an ‘almost
endless list of topics which would
have bearing upon family life.
4 Here the Reader’s Advisor can
help the student save time, and
also assure him a well rounded_
picture on his subject.

The card catalog room where
the advisor is located should be

— . . the students first approach to the

library, says Miss Garloch. The
catalog lists the books in the main

library by author, subject, and

often by title. ‘
Books for specialized libraries,

it such as Social Works, Nursing, Re-

tail Training Bureau, and several
others, are also listed in the gen-
eral card catalog. Although the
books have to be obtained at the
particular library. .
According to Miss Garloch, a

"Reader’s Ad.visor’s job here is to

help studentspobtain the_best ma-
terials ‘to complete their‘ assign-
ments. She will even help the
student conduct research on his
individual paper.
