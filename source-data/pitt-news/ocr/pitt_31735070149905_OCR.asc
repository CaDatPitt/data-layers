SGB,‘

Allocations
disagree

By Michael Ringling
Staff Writer

Pitt Student Government Board
member Halirn Genus pushed back
against Allocations Committee rec-
ommendations three times, and
each time a majority of the Board
took his side. '
During Tuesday night’s SGB
meeting, Genus moved to approve
in full the requests of three groups
— International Students for Social
Equality, Panther Grappling Club
and Reformed University Fellowship
— whose requests the Allocations
Committee initially recommended
the Board deny in full. _
Reformed University Fellowship,
a religious student group, requested
$1,677.35 for aweeklong conference

"in Florida that would include work-
shops, morning breakout sessions A

and beach time for four members
of the group.

The Allocations Committee ini-
tially recommended that the Board
deny the request in full because they
felt the trip was more of a personal
expense and the conference includ-
ed too much recreational time.

Britta Anderson, the business
manager for the group, said that
1,000 people will be in attendance
at the cpnference and that the event
will foster leadership development
for the attendees. The group attend-

- ed the conference last year, and after‘

the event the group’s membership
increased from 22 to‘50.

‘ Joseph Hughes, the vice presi-
dent of the Reformed University
Fellowship, said that the beach
and recreational time is a necessary
component to the conference. He

Experts discuss nuclearenergy, waste d

By Em Maier
Staﬁ" Writer

The international concerns of nu-
clear power and its ﬁiture sparked
discussion on_Pitt’s campus Tuesday
as experts examined aspects of en-
ergy alternatives, energy regulation
and public opinion.

More than 60 scientists, environ-
mentalists, journalists and students
attended the initial evening panel of
the two—day conference titled “From
Its Birthplace: A Symposium on the
Future of Nuclear Power.”

The-panel, which began at7 p.m.
in the William Pitt Union Ballroom,
focused on Arnerica’snuclear ﬁiture
andalso addressed concerns sur-
rounding nuclear energy ~— the
primary discussion topic of the sym-

posium for which 150 participants
have registered. . '

Pitt’s Dick Thornburgh Forum
for Law and Public Policy and the
Swanson School of Engineering both
sponsored the symposium.

Doug Heuck, publisher and
editor of The Pittsburgh Quarterly,
moderated the session, which lasted
more than two hours. Panelists in-
cluded individuals from both the

- private and public sectors, includ-

ing former Pennsylvania Gov. Dick
Thornburgh. .

One of the panelists, Vicky Bai-
ley, is a member of the Blue Ribbon
Commission on America’s Nuclear
Future, which is tasked with devis-
ing new strategies for managing
the burgeoning supply of nuclear
waste. -

Bailey spoke extensively onlthe

issue of nuclear waste and said that
peopleshould take a step back when
looking at how to deal with energy
sources. «

“The future does not have to
be cast in concrete, because, quite
frankly, one cannottell what tech-
nology will be available to us 50,
100 or 150 years from today,” Bailey
said. ‘ .

She said that the goal of the sym-
posium was to determine “how to
drive inevitable change that will
occur.” ' ' A

“We should start thinking no
on how to position ourselves about
that change,” Bailey said.

Bailey kicked off the panel dis-
cussion by asking the audience
members what they thought the
appropriate roles ofregulation and
government are in the management

ng sium D

of nuclear waste, which she said rep-
resents only a small portion of the
agency’s budget. , ’
She said the Blue Ribbon Com-
mission concluded that new insti-
tutional leadership is needed, and a
single-purpose federal corporation
is best—suited to get the waste pro-
gram backon track. '
“The approach we recommend
is explicitly adapted and staged.
Every voice, has.to be at the table.
The process needs to be open, ac-
cessible and transparent. Based on
[international success], we believe
this type of approach can provide

ﬂexibility and the sustainability and

trust needed_ to see controversial
utilities through to completion,”
Bailey said.

said that too much time spent in instruction

’ could be detrimental.

“Although there -is four hours scheduled for
free time, a majority of time is for teaching,”
Hughes said. “If more teaching was scheduled,
it would be too much to absor .”

Hughes will not be attendingthe confer-
ence, but he said that those who do attend will
learn about the Bible and the ways it relates
to issues oftoday. _

Board members Julie Hallinan and Alex
Murdoch voted against the motion to fund

o the request in full. Hallinan said she felt there

was too much time for recreational activities

included in the conference schedule, and she '

cited a website for the event that said there

‘Would be “time for_volleyball, basketball,

swimming, sailing and of course plenty of
time to sit on the beach.”
“In all the other conferences_that we fund‘

for, it is n’t advertised that there is time for the ’

beach,” Hallinan said after the meeting.
Genus declined to comment on his reasons

for supporting ﬁlll funding for the group’s _

request. _

' The Allocations Committee recommended
to deny Panther Grappling Club’s $2,112.26
request to bring in an-instructor for a seminar.

' Allocations Committee Chair Mike Nites said

the Committee felt that SGB had allocated
enough to the group this ﬁscal year.
Genus moved to approve the request in full,
and the Boardvoted unanimously in favor.
 International Students for Social-Equality
requested ‘$1,359.20 to bring a speaker to
campus, and the Committee recommended
that the Board deny the request in ﬁill. Nites
did, however, suggest in his recommenda-
tion that the Board listen to the group’s tes-
timony. . . °
After a representative informed the Board

V that the group had underestimated the an-

ticipated attendanceof the event and that
it funds two of its three events without SGB

« allocations, Genus moved to approve the re-
. quest in full —_ and the Board unanimously

agreed. 5
Also during the meeting, Hal1inanlan-

‘ nounced that plans are in the works to bring

to campus distribution shelves that would be
reserved for undergraduate publications. She

. said that Tom Visco, a senior.editor at the Pitt"

Political Review, met with Park Rankin, the
University architect,-to discuss the idea.

' ‘Hallinan said she thinks the projectwill be '

implemented relatively quickly, and she hopes

_ to have two boxes installed outside Nordy’s

Place near the bulletin board.
Before the openﬂoor segment of the meet‘-

ing, Board member Zoe Samuclzi moved to '

table the budget decisions for the Interfrater—

‘ nity Council and the Black Action Society until

next week. «SGB Presidentjames Landreneau
said the Board needed to review the Black
Action Society’s request with Student Affairs

because there was some confusion regarding .l

SYMPOSIUM

FROM PAGE I

 

She said developing more geological stor-

‘ age and consolidated storage facilities is the

best option for dealing with nuclear waste

‘ domestically.

David Lochbaum, the director of the Nu-

' clear Safety Project, vehemently illustrated

the dangers and problems present in nuclear
plants. _ ‘ r _ ‘
Mentioning ﬁre, ﬂooding and design er-
rors, Lochbaum said the current system of
handling nuclear waste is ineﬂicient, has a
poor grading system and sees little implemen-
tation of necessary repairs or modiﬁcations.
He compared the system to the bumbling,

well-intentioned Sergeant Schultz of the 1960s A

sitcom “Hogan’s Heroes,” who was known for
looking the other way and shouting, “I hear
nothing, I see nothing, I know nothing!”
Instead, Lochbaum clamored for the transi-
tion to a “nuclear ‘RoboCop’ -— aggressively,
consistently and fairly enforcing the safety
regulations that are set at the right level.”

Pete Sena, president-ofFirstEnergy Nuclear _

Operating Co., and Ann Bisconti, president of
public-opinion and communications research

ﬁrm Bisconti Research, agreed, stating the -

need for assertive policies.

“[The] good news is you’re understanding
problems and addressing them. What worries
me is complacency,” Sena said to Lochbaum.

The panel affirmed a statement made by
Lochbaum.

“Nuclear regulations is a three-way con- »

tract —— by the regulator, the public and the
licensing community. We are relying on luck

‘ right now rather than safety precautions, and

that’s not appropriate.” «
The symposium will continue today in the

WPU Ballroom. A discussion from 9 a.m. to 12

p.m. will focus on nuclear meltdowns, such

A as the 2011 incident at Fukushima Daiichi in

Japan, and will feature Harold Denton, the
former director of the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission’s Oﬂice of Nuclear Reactor Regu-
lation.' ' -

- At2 p.m., Barton]. Gordon, aformer Ten-

" nessee congressman and current partner at

a D.C.—based law ﬁrm, will hold a lunch pre-
sentation about the congressional climate in
relation to nuclear energy.

THE MOUSTACHE COLUMN OF AMERICA

The Moustache Column reflects

By Oliver Bateman
Columnist

 

Yes, the rumors are true: The Mous-

tache Column of America won’t be

' in this paper for'much longer. We’re

taking our talents to Texas, and we

can’t imagine there will ever be more -
. where this stuff came from. Where

does that leave you, hmm? Well,
you’ll no longer have. our columns
to skim when you’re spacing out in

your “cake” and “blow-off” courses, -
although that’s your own fault for °

registering for classes that have at-
tendance policies. A _

But enough with the negatives.
It’s already a jungle out there, what
with the economy being so terrible
and there not being any jobs for col-
lege graduates and Rick Santorum

winning primary after primary and ‘

yourbeloved_Pitt Panthers hoopsters
bottom-feeding their way through
the College Basketball Invitational
and all. Instead, let’s accentuate
the positive by reﬂecting on all the
amazing‘ things you’ve learned from
us during the three years we’ve been
in your life. _ , .

To start with, you learned what a
terrible injustice it was that Peyton
“Overrated” Hillis was elected to
front the Madden 2012 box. Since
our column ﬁrst appeared’ in the
paper, we’ve argued that this beer-
barrel-shaped ‘running back was
who we thought he was: an immobile
oaf who should be playing on special
teams for the New England Patriots,
not occupying a valuable roster slot
on the hated Cleveland Browns. His
NFL Combine proﬁle puts it best:
“Having him carry the ball often
would not be beneﬁcial, as he does
not have the second gear or speed
to make big gains on the ground.”
The masterminds who run the Kan-

. sas City Chiefs obviously disagree

with that assessment, though, and
have signed Hillis — who had been
thinking about retiring and joining
the CIA -— to a one-year, $3 million
deal. They’ll soon learn the error of
their ways. '

We also drew attention to the
Starbury line of low-cost athletic
apparel. Featuring legendary NBA
ball-hog and notorious clubhouse
cancer Stephon Marbury as its own-
er and spokesmodel, this company
sells high-top “kicks” and billowing
white T-shirts at bottom-basement

_ prices.Why Starbury

  
 
  

gear hasn’.t proved more
popular with the bros continues to
elude us, given -that unlaced, high-

.top kicks and a billowing white T

are the perfect complement to a ﬂat-
brimmed baseball cap and a corni-
cally oversized wallet chain. After
you surf over to starbury.com, buy
the entire spring line and rock it at
one of those killer “Dirty South”
Oakland -basement parties where
everyone drinks headache-inducing
malt liquor out of red Solo cups and
afew thirty"something townies show
up around midnight to “run a train”
on the beer pongtable, they too will
learn the errorof their ways.
Surely our greatest accomplish-

ment was the investigative reporting
we did on the bro lifestyle. Believe us,
in the course of ﬁling our dispatches,
every single stop was pulled out of
wherever it is that the stops are kept

' (in the medicine cabinet, maybe?).
.We totally immersed ourselves in

their fast-paced, 9 p.m. to 3 a.m. life-
style, which wasn’t nearly as easy as
it sounds. Can you imagine what it
feels like to wake up long after the
sun has set with a ferocious hangover
that is eitherfrom last night or is the
vestige of an even worse hangover
from two weeks ago? Do you know
how hard it is to remain upright for
more than four hours aday while also
remaining42o-friendly and subsist-
ing on a. diet of fat-laden, nutrition-
free $5 pizza pies? Could you go an
entire semester without so much as

Febreze-ing your loose sweatpants_

or dragging your weary carcass to
a single event that starts before the

Danielle Hu [Staff Illustrator

crack of midnight? No, absolutely
not. But we suffered for you, friends,
and you’re all the better for it. p
We’ve also walked with you in
your oversized, unlaced Starbury
high-tops as 'you navigated your
way. along the haphazard highway
_that leads to a BA in the ever-pop-
ular “undecided” major. When you
needed a thesis statement, we had
one at the ready: “Of all the presi-
dents, George Washington was one
of them.” When you were consider-
ing graduate school, we were there
to say, “Why not? Everything else out
there is pretty miserable.” When you
were trying to drop that $5-pizza-

Letter to the editor

To the Editor,

The editorial on financial literacy
is spot-on, and I agree entirely that a
ﬁnancial literacy course should be a re-
quirement for all students. Thefollowing
informationshould be of special interest
to Pitt students: Student Financial Ser-
vices offers ﬁnancial literacy counseling.
As a matter of fact, many departments
—»psychology being one — include a

_financial session as part of their senior

seminars. Some freshmen are also intro-
duced tothe services of the Student Pay-

Thereare at least three staff members
in Student Financial Services that are
certified in the area of financial literacy
« ‘and who would be happy to do a pub-‘
lic session. Personal appointments are
also welcome. Unfortunately, not many
students or departments have taken ad-
vantage of this service or know what
this area has to offer. Here isa linkthat
can be found on the Student-Financial
Services website: http://www.paym’ents.
pitt.edu/showme/index.php. .1, person-
ally, would encourage all students to get
' on board and‘ collectively request that

experience for both undergraduate and
graduate students at Pitt. The impact

' can be devastating for students who are

not financially literate. If interested in
obtaining more information regarding
the services Student Financial Services
has to offer, feel free to contact the di-
rector of the Student Payment Center,
Steve Cohen, at 412-624-1163.’

  Pittfalls short agaistlouisville  

By R] Sepich
Staff Writer

The Pitt softball team came close
to handing Louisville its ﬁrst loss
this season this weekend, but while
the Panthers made their Big East
opponent earn each victory, the
Cardinals still ﬁnished with the
three—game sweep. _

In the opening Big East series
of the season for both teams, the

L Cardinals (25-0,3-0 Big East) out-

scored the visiting Panthers (15-12,
0-3 Big East) by a combined four
runs in the series as Pitt narrowly
missed pulling off a trio" of upsets.

“I thought we played really well
against one of the best teams in
the country,” senior catcher Holly

Stevens said. “We battled, but we _

just couldn’t ﬁnish.”
I . Louisville 3, Pitt 1

Pitt pounced on its unbeaten op-
position in Saturday’s series opener
when freshman Savannah King’s
single scored Stevens to" give the

Panthers an early 1-0 lead.
’ King, in her ﬁrst career Big,

East game,‘ carried that momen-
tumfinto in the pitching circle with
three hitless innings to begin the
- game against Louisville’s Big East-
leading offense. -But in the decisive
fourth inning, the Cardinals strung
together ﬁve hits that produced all
three of their runs.

Ryan ampsonl F

The Panthers tried to rally, but

their offense struggled with run— 4

ners on base. Pitt stranded nine
total base runners in the defeat.

“We just couldn’t put hits to»-

. gether,” King said. “We needed to

have more resilience and a little _

' extra ﬁght, which could have made
the difference in the game.”

Louisville.4, pm 3

The second game of Saturday’s
doubleheader was eerily similar to
Louisville’s ﬁrst victory.

. Trailing 1-O entering the third
inning, the Panthers grabbed the
lead when Stevens hit a two-run
single and freshman Maggie Sevilla
and senior Kelly Hmiel crossed the
plate.

However, the rally ended when
Louisville threw Stevens out at the
plate followinga single by fresh-
man Carissa Throckmorton.

Freshman Alexa Larkin, who
also made her Big East pitching
debut, conceded Pitt’s advantage
in the fourth inning when Louisville
regained the lead with a three-run
homerun; ,

A Sevilla solo home run nar-
rowed the deﬁcit to one, but yet
again the Panthers couldn’t ﬁnd the
crucial hit to score the tying run.

sweep on Sunday after edging

out the°Pa‘nthers in a defensive?

battle.
- After ﬁve scoreless innings,

Pitt grabbed’ the ﬁrst lead for the

third game in a row. Stevens was
the orchestrator of the offense —
she singled and then scored her
17th run of theseason following a
double from fellow senior Yvette
Bravo.

But the lead didn’t last long.

In the bottom of the sixth in-
ning, Louisville used a single, an
error and a walk to load the bases

‘with Cardinals before a double

scored the two runs necessary to
snatch yet another victory away
from the Panthers.

Despite the losses, Pitt senior
inﬁelder Kristencheesebrew said
she believes this weekend provided
another example of the softball
program’s progress.

“We’ve been competitive
against some of the best teams in
the country this year, like Texas,
Oregon and now Louisville,” she

said. “Now we need to grow as a =

team and get better so we can get
over that hump.”

The Panthers will host Kent
State in a nonconference double-
header Wednesday afternoon be-
fore welcoming No. 22 South Flori-
da to the Petersen Sports Complex
for a three-game Big East series
beginning Saturday. .

,“We’re ready to come back this
week and start picking up some
wins,” King said. 5

New York Yankees relief pitcher
Joba Chamberlain dislocated his
right ankle last Thursday. He did
this, reportedly, on a trampoline
at a children’s play place, where
he was with his son.

“Aswe understand, they were

at, they have these kids’ places

where you jump on trampolines
and stuff like that,” Yankees gen-
eral manager Brian Cashman told
ESPN the«next day. V
When a freak injury fells an
athlete, public shaming usually
comes first. Journalists revise
their lists of memorable off-
ﬁeld hazards, from former Cubs

“outﬁelder Sammy Sosa’s sneeze .
(and sprained back) to two-time

All:Star Kevin Mitchell’s attempt

g to eat a frozen donut that he mi- -

crowaved for too long (chipped
tooth, root canal).

All of this comes withan air
of, “Isn’t it hilarious Chamberlain
spent three days in the hospi-
tal?” ' .

Let he who is without a freak
injury, though, cast the ﬁrst fast-
ball. *

I’ve tripped down stairs be-
fore. I’ve tripped up stairs, too.
And, yes, I’ve injured myself at a
children’s play place.

I must have been about 5 years
old when I suffered a fate similar
to Chamberlain’s A

I don’t remember what indoor
play place I went to, nor do I re-
member the reason for the cel-

ebration. I do, though, remember ’

that the previous time I had been
there, I’d gotten lost in the dark,
serpentine polyurethane tunnels
built ‘into one of the walls, so I
was on edge upon arrival. ,

My afternoon ended abruptly

jwhen I jumped into the ball pit

— the surprisingly shallow ball
pit. I hit my knee on the pit’s
floor, which, in the mid—1990s,
apparently, contained more loose
screws and serrated edges than
it does today.

I gashed open my right knee.

Everyone suffers so-called
“freak” injuries. But outside the
sports world, they’re just injuries.
Athletes are the only ones privi-

leged enough to tear _a_ hamstring

trying to chase downva 80-yard 

touchdown pass or to separate a
shoulder while wrestling a bear
into unconsciousness —— which I
sometimes claim is why I‘ have a
faded scar on my knee cap.
Chamberlain received some
grief from fans and journalists
because he already resided on
theidisabled list. He had elbow
ligament replacement surgery
lastjune 16, and he was expected

to return this summer. Now the.
26-year-old is dangerously close 

to receiving the “injury-prone”
tag.

The Yankees had to announce
publicly that they weren’t consid-
ering releasing him. Odds are he
won’t pitch this season, although
Cashman told CBS ‘Sports it would
be possible “if everything goes
right.”

Outside of sports, two injuries
don’t mean a person “can’t stay
healthy.” That’s just how it is. I

wish I were lucky enough to haye,- 
I only the ball pit incident in my

past. But there’s'more.

The next time you’re in a high
school, check out the interior
side of a locker door. The com-
bination lock built into the door
protrudes from the thin metal.

-The rusted—still scre.ws ‘don’t

budge, although they are a bit
jagged. The clasp that locks the
door also juts out.

We shared lockers in high

school. One person used the top  A

half, another used the bottom.
-Junior year, I had the bottom half.
One morning, I crouched down-
to gather some books, and the
weight of the door swung it back

close to me without my notice. _,

When I stood, I bonked my head
against something built into the
door —_ a screw, the clasp, the
inner workings of the lock — and

- cut my scalp._ '

I have a bump and, presum-

ably, a scar on the right side of ‘ 

my scalp, although my hair hides
it. I’ll know what’s there when my

— hairline recedes.

There are plenty of “stupid”
injuries of which to tell (the

time I gave myself a black eye 
_ on a slide,’the time I broke my

nose in middle school gym class),

Hines Ward laelongslin the
I     Hall of Fame 2

By Donnie Tasser
staﬁwriter

. Hines Ward = Hall of Fame.

For 14 years, Ward was one of the faces of

_ the ‘Pittsburgh Steeler franchise. He epito-

mized itslblue-collar, hard-nosed style of
play, but he had fun too. Ward played with
a chip on his shoulder and a smile on-his
face. And I am sad to see him go.

We all knew this was coming. Entering

. this season, we knew he was getting up there

in age. He was never the fastest, but as the
season wore on, it became more and more

' evident that Ward’s skills had greatly di—

minished. He was on the way. out. When he
recorded his 1,000th career reception on
a shovel pass — for minus 2 yards — the
deal was sealed.

Ward announced his retirement on
March 20 after being released from the

‘Steelers on Feb. 29. ‘

Now the argument (ofﬁcially) begins. I

feel that'Hines Ward is a deﬁnite, sure-ﬁre
' Hall of Famer. But there are haters out there,

and I will refute their biggest arguments.
Catching 1000 passes in a passing era
is akin to hitting 500 home runs in MLB’s

. Steroid Era. '

Ward’s biggest argument for admittance

‘into Canton came with that pathetic shovel

pass. _

He became just. the eighth player of all
time to record’1,000 career receptions —
onlyjerry Rice, Terrell Owens, Isaac Bruce,

1 Tim Brown, Marvin Harrison, Cris Carter

and Tony Gonzalez have more. To put it in
perspective, Randy Moss, Torry Holt and
Keyshawn Johnson are not on that list.
Hines is. . .
Also, keep in mind that for the ﬁrst half
of his career, he caught passes from the likes
of Kordell Stewart and Tommy Maddox and

that for the majority "of his career, the Stéel'- '

ers were a run-ﬁrst team.
He was never a dominant receiver.
Though it is true that Ward was only se-
lected to four Pro Bowls, his value to the
Steelers‘ franchise was much higher. You

could call Ward an innovator. .
Even though he played out his career in
a passing era, he took the receiver position

back in time to when they caught passes

and blocked. .

Ward was undoubtedly the best block-
ing receiver in the league, and that can’t
be seen solely through statistics. The only
statistic to back up Ward in this department
is that he was voted the Dirtiest Player in
the NFL twice. *

Jerome Bettis, Willie Parker and Rashard
Mendenhall wouldn’t have found half the
running room they did on the outside with-
out one of Ward’s crushing downﬁeld blocks.
Watching him plant Baltimore Ravens safety
Ed Reed into the turf with block after block
are some of my fondest Hines Ward memo-
ries; T

He rarely faced double-teams. ' .

Ward almost always had a receiving part-

ner alongside him to draw coverage from '

him, with players such as Plaxico Burress,
Santonio Holmes and Mike‘ Wallace ﬁlling
the role ‘over the years.

But the same can be said about many of
the other great_ receivers. Marvin Harrison
had Reggie Wayne. Isaac Bruce had Torry
_Holt. Lynn Swann hadjohn Stallworth. Even

' Jerry Rice had Terrell Owens for several

years when he started getting older. _
Hines Ward not only mgde blocking part
of the receivers’ game, he also ‘perfected the
art of playing in the slot. Every other great
receiver played a majority of his career at

_ split end, set on the line. Ward played a yard

back, enabling him to ‘move in mption before

the play to set up mismatches in coverage V

and blocking. .

_ No other great receiver was used in that
9 way prior to the snap. He played a vital role

in two Steelers Super Bowl victories, win-
ning the Most Valuable Player award in one
of them. _ »

Hines Ward was a Steeler through and

- through, and one-day he will have a bust

in Canton. Right now there is a log jam for
receivers, but one day Ward will receive what
he deserves — one of those bronze heads
in the Football Hall of Fame. ﬂ I

FROM PAGE 7

but one stands out for its similarity to
A.j. Burnett’s infamous bunt this spring
training. .

Burnett, ac'quired this spring -by the
Pittsburgh Pirates, joined the likes of
Chamberlain, Sosa and Mitchell when he
bunted a baseball into his face earlier this
month. He hopes to return from his frac-
tured orbital bone before 1ate.April.

When I was about 14, I played pick—up

roller hockey with friends most weekends.
One game, I crashed thelnet to attempt a
deﬂection —— and tipped the ballkright into
my face. Nothing bruised or broke, as a

14-year—old’s wrist shot [has the strength‘

of wet toilet paper, but mark this down as
another “dumb” moment.
Except no injury is dumb, especially

ones that athletes like Chamberlain and’

Burnett suffer an or off the ﬁeld. They’re

' just people, and people injure themselves

in the strangest ways -— or so I convince
myself. ' p '

Now if you’ll excuse me, I’m off to trip
on a banana. h
