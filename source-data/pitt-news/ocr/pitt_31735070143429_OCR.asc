A federal judge ruled today that
the city must give a permit to one
group hoping to protest Down-
town in the days before the G-20
Summit.

U.S. District Judge Gary Lan-

comprised primarily of women,
to erect tent cities in Point State
Park from 7 p.m. Sunday through
7 p.m. Tuesday. The group plans
to camp in the park overnight “to

gees who have been displaced by
the wars in Iraq, Afghanistan and
Gaza,” according to court docu-

Beauty in the e

ye of the beholder

Multicultural sorority Zeta Sigma Chi explores the world’s different expressions of beauty

Caitlyn Christensen
Staff Writer

The women of Zeta Signa Chi ex-
plored the cultural implications of
henna, hijabs and tattoos during their
“Beauty Has No Boundaries” event
in the.William Pitt Union ballroom
last night. _ .

The multicultural sorority hoped
to examine the different qualities
that constitute beauty in different
cultures.

“Obviously, women of all ages
and cultural backgrounds struggle
with identity issues and with feeling
beautiful,” Lindsay Litowitz, a Zeta
Sigma Chi member, said. “We want
to show how everyone is beautiful to
someone.”

Sorority members experimented
with tying hijabs in the traditional
Muslim fashion. Scarves are an indi-
cation of modesty in Muslim culture.
One member, Lucy Rankin, said she
found the concept of modesty “in-
teresting.”

“’I‘here’s atraditional Muslim say-
ing: You can change your looks, but
you can’t change your personality,”

Rankin said. “That’s somethingl can
agree wi ”

In something of a culture clash,
hijab—wearing sorority members
practiced their belly dancing skills
beside the Indian display, where Fran

Morales spoke about sexuality in In-

dian culture.

Morales said that ornamentation
is a popular way of expressing both
beauty and sex drive in India.

“Apparently, a bigger nose or-
nament means a bigger sex drive,”
Morales said. “And henna evokes
sensation, red being the most sexual
color.” .

For the event, Morales donned an
Indian bindi, a forehead decoration
worn by women in South Asia, for
the event. -

“They are supposed to bring em-
phasis to the eyes,” Morales said.

Thejapanese table featured bright-
ly colored cloth and vibrantjapanese
fashion, as well as photographs of the
popularjapanese goth trend.

Japanese goth outﬁts feature Loli-
ta-like dresses, parasols and platform
shoes.

Jamie Krieger, another member,
said that herfavorite fashionable ele-

_ ment is a traditionaljapanese tattoo

used to symbolize purity. The ritual
surroundingthe tattoo was something
she could empathize with, she said.

“I waited four years until I got
my tattoo,” Krieger said. “I wanted
it to mean something. Injapan, men
cannot be tattooed unless they have
done something for their country or
family. For women, it’s a symbol of
their purity.” ’ ‘

In traditional Japanese culture, a
woman receives the outline of a tattoo
at the age of thirteen, then the ﬁill tat-
too at the age of twenty, to symbolize
that she is still pure.

Krieger said shethinksAmericans
couldtake example fromthejapanese
standard.

“So many Americans do it for re-
bellion or for the superﬁcial reason
that it’s body art,” she said. “I think
we could learn something here. Like
when guys go out and get their area

Rankin said the event only helped-
her conﬁrm her self—conﬁdence about
her own beauty.
“Of course I’m beautiful,” 
said. “We’re all beaut:iful in different

ways —— just like the women in these
cultures.” 4

The event brushed on modern po-
litical issues related to beauty with a
display by the Brazil Nuts, Pitt’s Por-

. tugeuese club. Rosa McGill’s display

focused on race in Brazil.

“In Brazil, white women are con-
sidered ethnically beautiﬁil, despite
the majority of Brazilian women hav-

ing dark skin,” McGill said. “There is
also rampantdisenfranchisementand
general racism.”
McGill said she likedthe eventbe-
cause itwas multi-dimensional.
“We’re combining beauty with
international politics,” McGill said.

“It’s important for women to know _

about these issues. Beauty can be
political, too.”

In his e—mail, Cooper said faculty should
treatthe Summitastheywouldasevere weather
event, meaning professors should make ar-
rangements to communicate last—minute clos-
ings with their students.

A notice posted on the my.pitt.edu portal

' encouraged students to learn more about global

issues during the Summit, but asked them to
abide by the Student Code of Conduct.

“In accordance with the Pitt Promise, please
conduct yourselfin a civil manner and exercise
mutual respect and concern for others,” the
notice reads.

“Don’t let one bad decision negatively affect
your future,” it adds. '

Fedele said Pitt’s public relations ofﬁce plans
to launch a website by Monday that will keep
students posted about G-20 preparations on
campus. He said students should be able to
link to the website from the University’s home
page.

Neighboring Carnegie Mellon plans to close
its Scaife, Porter and Baker halls and the Tep-
per School of Business beginning at 12:30 p.m.
Thursday and return to a normal schedule
Friday. .

Indira Nair, the school’s vice provost for edu-
cation, said in a letter to students and staff that
university oﬂicials decided to close those build-
ings because they’re close to Schenley Park.

They also chose to close Hunt Library from
8 am. Thursday to 8 am. Friday. a g

Nair also cautioned her students and staff to
take common—sense safety precautions during

the Summit. She said they should be aware of

their surroundings, lock their offices and dorm
rooms and avoid walking alone at night.

Officials at Carlow University, on the other
side of Pitt’s campus, moved the school’s fall
break to next week so students won’t be around
during the G—20. They’ll make up their classes
at a later date, said Louise Sciannomeo, one of
the school’s spokeswomen.

She said only essential staff — public safety

officers, someadministratorsandmaintenance ‘

workers — will come to campus during the
Summit. The university plans to house them
on campus so they can avoid delays in traffic,
she said. ‘

Downtown universities are taking more
drastic precautions.

Oﬁicials at Duquesne canceled classes begin-
ning at noon Wednesday, and the students will
make up their classes the week ofThanksgiving.
The school’s residence halls will remain open
for students who can’t leave, according to the
school’s website. Duquesne ofﬁcials didn’t return
calls asking for comment.

Point Park, also Downtown, will close

Wednesdayand reopen Sauirday, Sept. 25. Mary V

Ellen Solomon, a spokeswoman for Point Park,
said the school’s residence halls will close. Only
a minimal number of students who applied for
exceptions, because they live too far away or
were unable to make travel plans, will be allowed
to stay, Solomon said. ’

' She said Point Park will continue to hold
classes either online orinotherlocations, which

individual professors will choose. A

‘ “We anticipate all classes will still be held
through some sort of alternative means,” Solo-
mon said._

Only essential staff will be allowed on Point
Park’s campus, and the University might house
their staff on campus, if needed.

“The safety and security of our campus and
community is our number one priority,” Solo-
mon said.

Chatham University in Shadyside is just
about the only school to go virtually uninter-
rupted by the Summit.

“All systems are rtmning as normal,” said
Paul Kovach, one of the school’s spokesmen.

The only event at Chatham rescheduled due
to the Summit was a trip to the Andy Warhol
Museum, which has been moved to a later date,
he said.

The Secret Service, in coordination with
local safety oﬁicials, has decided to secureape-

The virtues and vices
of the 5 dollar pizzas

very day, we enjoy an array of
dining options as diverse as

they are delicious.

But every night, our options dwin- -

dle to a brave few, a nocturnal elite
who not only survive the darkness,
but thrive in it.

This fearless faction is overshad-
owed by a storied rivalry that rules
the night: Sorrento’s versus Antoon’s
pizza.

Sure, there are other late-night
options —- and we’re not saying that
that these two places are any better or
worse than their alternatives — but
the $5 pizza rivalry is an anomaly.

An assorted sampling of custom-
ers frequent most restaurants, but
Sorrento’s and Antoon’s are visited
almost exclusively by students. If
you’ve ever seen the scene late at
night, it’s clear that we’ve claimed it
as our turf.

Located conveniently close to
one another and offering late-night
pizza at the same price — although
technically, Antoon’s is ten cents
cheaper — it’s only natural that a
competition developed over the past
few decades.

The ﬁiction between the two At-
wood Street staples is out there —
we’ve all been a part of the debate
at one time or another — but it’s
remained informal, and thus, we’ve
have never been able to reach a con-
sensus on which establishment is the
true late—night king.

For perhaps the ﬁrst time ever,
let us publicly and proudly begin the
debate.

The case for Sorrento’s

Admittedly, we’ve had midnight
dalliances with Antoon’s, waking up
next to the box and rushing it out of
the apartment before a neighbor can
see our shame.

Sorrento’s is the kind of pizza you
take home to meet your mother. It’s
hospitable. It’s got smarts -— Sorren-
to’s offers free Wi-Fi Internet — and
it’s more ﬂavorful.

Plus, it’s got class. Technically, Sor-
rento’s is more expensive, but you get
what you pay for. When it comes to
cheese, Sorrento’s is the happy and
generous Launchpad to Antoon’s

 

Scrooge McDuck

Sorrento’s ﬁlls your gullet faster,
and it accepts credit cards, unlike the
cash-onlyAntoon’s. The cashless pay-
ment option is crucial for late-night
lushes with nothing in their pockets
but bottle caps and paper clips.

Yes, Sorrento’s is greasier, but if
you don’t like grease, don’t eat pizza.
Plus, greasy food helps morninghang—
overs — supposedly.

OwnerAaron Price welcomes the
rowdy college crowd. He creates a
community atmosphere in his par-
lor, especially on cold nights. While
soused and jollybrethrenﬁnd sanctu-
ary inside awarm Sorrento’s, Antoons
customers stand cold and lonely in
the Pittsburgh winter like  in
a Soviet breadline.

During the Christmas season, Sor-
rento’s even hangs lights.

It’s simple pleasures like these that

Contrary to the durable ﬁbers of an
Antoon’s pie, a slice of Sorrento’s flim-
sy pizza ﬂops like a dead ﬁsh, while
grease falls from the cheese like water
droplets from a leaky pipe. Needless
to say, this feeble pizza is hardly con-
ducive to the late night inhaling of
cheesy treats.

Yeah, yeah, Sorrento’s offers seat- -

ingforthe after—party masses. No,An-
toon’s doesn’thave seats,butitdoesn’t
need them. Spare the fanfare and
tawdry décor. You’re hungry, maybe
you’ve hadacouple drinks, andallyou
want is pizza. Get your pizza, get out
and keep the night going.

In a way, neither place has better
pizza than the other. Ifwe wanted
good pizza, we wouldn’t be eating
at 2 am Both places serve relatively
average pizzato a demographic that is
marked more by its intoxication than
its taste for ﬁne dining.

But every night, our options dwindle to a
brave few, a nocturnal elite who not only
survive the darkness, but thrive in it.

make Sorrento’s the best $5 pizza joint
in town.

The case for Antoon’s
Antoon’s operates on two stan-

dards: dirt—cheap pizza and quick \

service. And when it comes to size,
Antoon’s will leave you satisﬁed no
matter what kind of night you’ve
had.

An Antoon’s $5 measures 16
inches, while a Sorrento’s pie is a
mere 14.

Imagine yourself eating an An-
toon’s pizza. The sauce has a mildly
sweet taste complimented by a de-
lectable, pleasant crunch of cheesy
bubbles. OK, so really it’s just $5 pizza,
but you won’t ﬁnd a better deal in
Oakland.

Now take hold of that piece of
Sorrento’s pizza —— or try to, at least.

But that’s not why we love Sorren—

to’s and Antoon’s — and our editorial
board was split in avote for afavorite.
It’s the remembrance of debaucher-
ies past at both establishments that
fuel the feverish support for either.
Whether having rolled from the Ga-
rage Door into Sorrento’s to scream
at the ﬁnale of a Penguins game or
having marched triumphantly past
the scattered bodies of suiporous un-
derclassman with your ready—to—go
Antoon’s, you’ve spent one of your
college nights celebrating with $5

Organization more a frustration than a key to success

  
  

Ben Korman
Columnist

Freedom is nice. I have plenty of it
now, but this hasn’t alwaysbeen the
case.

was constraining in ways that college
is not,— I could give no input as-far

as my courses‘went or whether I sat .

next to Robert Kaplan (stinky) or Ra-
chel Silverstein (hubba hubba)_.—'

But as my responsibilities have
increased, I’ve developed an appre-
ciation for the decisions the edu-
cational system once made on my
behalf — namely, how to organize
my work. V

I’d be given a list of required sup-
plies on the ﬁrst day of school, which
I’d forward on to my parents, and
the next day I’d have my ﬁve marble

_‘ notebooks, ﬁve folders and what-
ever else my teacher had deemed

imperative to my academic excel-
lence that year. V .
Now, the average professor is too

* entrenched in academia to weigh

the virtues of the tl1ree—ring binder
against those of the ﬁve-subject

Elementary school, for example, i

notebook. The choice is up to me.
It is inordinately stressﬁil.

_ A stroll down the school supply
aisle ﬁirthercomplicates the matter.
Do I go for the big loose-leaf binder
or go the one-spiral-notebook-per—_
course route?

Do I spend the equivalent of an

hour’s pay at my minimum wage

job on a durable notebook that’ll _

withstand the wear-and-tear of a
full semester?

Or do I shell out the ﬁscal equiv-
alent of a canned beverage in ex-
change for one withoutperforations
for seamless sheet removal?

I’ve tried virtually every permuta-
tion of organization, yet the result is
always the same: My English papers
will inevitably end up in my anthro-
pology notebook, and at least one‘
syllabus will turn up in my under-
wear drawer. , , .

My disorganization, though, isn’t
as much an impediment to success as

much as mere inconvenience — just '
as I’d respond to my parents’ pleas —

that I clean my room as a child, “It
sure is a mess. But -it’s my mess.”

In researching the pros and
cons of being organized, I came
across U.S. Patent Application No.

2oo2o1o6235A1, titled “System for
organizing, planning and motivating
schoolwork and the like.”

The proposal, submitted in 2002
by Dr. Columbia E. Perryjones, con-
sists of six binders, each with nine
dividers and designated “To Do” and
“Turn In” folders. The system is so
intricate that upon viewing its 19
diagrams, one can’t help but ask,
“Do people really need this?”

“The primary object of this in-
vention is to provide for students
a system and means to organize
schoolwor ,” wrotejones inthe ap-
plication’s ‘Objects and Advantages’
section. The system also “encourag-
es and instructs the user in building
lifelong habits of being organized.”

Is being so organized really im-
perative? Considering the amount of
foresight evidently poured into this
project, one would assume fastidious
organization skills are auniversal
prerequisite to success. _ ‘ »

I spoke to some classmates with

varying GPAs about how they orga-"C

nize their work during the semes-

I ter, and itturns out good grades and

organization skills don’t always go
hand—in—hand. 1- »
Rather, the concept of organiza-

tion appears to be decidedly sub-
jective. Consider the following case
studies:

The Agenda Setter

GPA: 3.2

“I make a really organized to-do
list, which I update nightly,” says The
Agenda Setter. “I also color code it.
Green means it’s an assignment I
have to physically hand in, orange
is for essays and red is for quizzes
and exams.”

“But as my GPA proves, I am not
the best of students,” admits The
Agenda Setter. “I just happen to be
a really organized person.”

The Risk-Taker

GPA: 3.1

“I would like to think that my
setup is neat and tidy,” says The Risk-
Taker. “But one hazard I have come
across is USB keys. One day, mine
just stopped working — I lost ev-
erything.” The Risk Taker has since
learned to back up his resources,
electronic or otherwise.

The Contrarian

GPA: 3.4

“I.’ve always been jealous of
friends who have intricate note-
taking and studying habits,” The
Contrarian said. “Byt it’s a double-

edged sword because while they are
highlighting their faces off, I am on
the couch watching ‘Home Improve-

' ment.”’

“1t’s like a sacriﬁce,” adds The
Contrarian. “People who are com-
mitted to academics struggle in
other areas.”

If you happen to be reading this
column in class, take a quick survey
of those around you. Perhaps there
is an agenda setter to your left or a
risk Taker to your right.

But it is far more likely that the
person next to you has his own dis-
tinctive system, just as unique as his
ﬁngerprints or DNA.

The aforementioned cases un-
derscore how our organization hab-
its not only speak to our larger pri-
orities, but who we are on the most

basic levels: Who do you become’

after your ﬂash drive malﬁinctions?
When your notebook grows so thick
it can barely close, do you clean it
out? Or do you see how much more
it can handle?

Poundstone leaves pets at home, brings laughs

Acclaimed comedienne Paula Poundstone will perform her unique brand of stand—up, and she may even Tweet about it ’

Andres Miguel ‘

Staff Writer

Paula Poundstone

Carnegie Library Music Hall,
Munhall, Pa.

Saturday, Sept. 19, 8 p.m.
$27 - 37 V

Veteran comedienne Paula
Poundstone will perform Saturday
at the Carnegie Library Music Hall in
Munhall, vitalizing the crowd with
her unique personality and off-color,
conversational brand of comedy.

While not a regularvisitorto Pitts-
burgh, Poundstone has a number of
memories of the city from child-
hood.

“I used to have cousins that lived
[in Pittsburgh] ,” said Poundstone,
“and they used to hand me down
the laundry chute they had in their
house.”

Far from being a traumatic expe-
rience, though, Poundstone recalled
being “quite willing.”

While Poundstone is best known
for her stand—up and the persona
crafted alongwithit—— her penchant
for pantsuits, ties and vests, as well
as her endearingly self-deprecating
humor — Poundstone reaches far
beyond the world of stand—up in her
modern career, inﬁltrating numerous
other media.

A regular panelist on “Wait, Wait
 Don’t Tell Me!” —— an hour—long
weekly radio show involving a come-
dic quiz-show approach to current
news topics -— she can be heard on
National Public Radio or on podcasts.

‘her comedic mate-

- books intended

Having been a panelist for years,
Poundstone rates it well above many
of her other gigs. -

“The great part [of the show] is
that I get to make jokes about real
facts and that nearly the whole thing
is improvised,” Poundstone said. “It’s
like being a batter in a batter’s cage.
There are no limits imposed by the
producers, no pre-written, terribly
unﬁmny comments I’rn told to read. I
love it, even though ‘
I currently hold the
record for losing.”

In addition to

rials, Poundstone is
also the" co-author
of three children’s
mathematics work-

for middle school
kids.

“When I had to
help my [three kids,
Toshia, Allison and
Thomas E.] with,
math problems, I
usually ended up
solving the prob-
lerns for them be-
fore I could teach
them how to do it
As a result, I ended
up writing word
problems to help
teach themthe con-
cepts and making
them funny — to
the best of my abil-
ity,” Poundstone

said.

“I also got frustrated with how
awful the math workbooks I bought
for my kids were, so I talked with my

high school math teacher, with who I _

remained friends after high school,
and this kind of just happened,” she
said. , _ _

On apersonal front, Poundstone’s
life is ﬁlled with her children and her
veritable stable of pets: “Thirteen cats,

two bunnies, aGerman shepherdmix
and a bearded dragon lizard, just to
name a few,” Poundstone said.
“That equals about -two to three
hours‘ a day of just dealing with ani-
malwaste, and it gets hard sometimes
making it seem interestingto my kids
and my fans,” she said. -A
While her work certainly keeps
her busy — between touring, writ-
ing and her various media comrnit-.
ments — Pound-
stone claims that
she easily works
more when she’s
“not actually
working.”
Poundstone
has alsoevolved
into a viable in-
temet presence
by learning the in-
tricacies of com-
puters in order
to know howto
regularly update
her Twitter and
Facebook pages.
“I try to up-
date three or
four times a day,
but it’s hard to get

'I’m at the com-
puter. A friend of
mine once called

that he dropped
money into. In

Paula Poundstone will talk kids and pets tomorrow night. think computers

things donewhen -

l are holes that you instead drop min-

utes of your life into, never to be seen
again,” she said.

, Poundstone recently released her
ﬁrst comedy album, I (Heart) jokes:
Paula Tells Them in Maine, a record-

ing of a particularly interesting show .

in Maine.

“It was just where someone hap-
pened to have a tape recorder,” Pound-
stone said. “But the crowdwas great I

askedoneguywhathedid,andhesaid ‘

he was — he was a ‘snow ranger’. I’ve
been asking people their professions
for a long time, but I’d never heard of
a snow ranger! Unfortunately, now
that the states are bankrupt, I doubt
he has a lot of job security.”
Citing it as a- good experience,

' Poundstone hopes to put out similar

albums in the ﬁitirre.

AsforherPittsburghshow,Pound- _

stone promises jokes about her busy
life with her kids and animals, her des-

perate struggle to remain an informed ‘

citizen and competent voter and her
dueling, equivalent loves forAbraham

Lincoln and the Hardy Boys. How-‘

ever, a large chunk of Poundstone’s
shows — and, by her admission, her

favorite part —’ is the improvisation '

she does when she interacts with the
audience. _

“I’rn not sure why it’s my favorite
part — it’s like asking why those gi-
ant green beetles can ﬂy — but great
things always unfold,” she said. “My
shows aren’t totally unscripted, but
they’re a lot like _cake batter —— add-
ing in dry ingredients.unt1'l you get
something delicious.” ‘

Where ’s my ‘Revolver?’ Madonna drops the ball

Madonna’s latest single from her upcoming greatest hits album makes Kieran want to die,‘ but deﬁnitely not ‘happy’

Kieran Layton
-A 8 E Editor

 

Madonna has oﬂicially crushed my pop
music-loving soul.

Earlierthis summerglheardademo
that was slated to be on the Queen of
Pop’s new greatest hits collection, set
to come out Sept. 29. The song, “Re-
volver” was an incredibly catchy pop
songthatl quickly deemed the song of
the summer, despite the fact that itwas

a version sung by some chick named
RaVaughn. '

All summer, I waited for Madonna
to drop her rendition of the single. If
the demo was that good, I could only
imagine how Madge could make it
better. Perhaps she would tweak the
synthesizers, throw in an extra—syn-
copated percussion beat or even add a
verse exclusive to her version.

Unfortrmately, the high quality
Madonna version of the song leaked
yesterday, and it is an understatement
to saythatwhattumed outwasjusta

disappointment.

Think of your favorite pop song.
Take any recent Lady Gaga track —-
they seem to be crowd favorites these
days. Now, imagine LindsayLohan tak-
ingastabatitafteranightofhardparty—
ingwhen she justfound out she losther
upcoming movie role to Tara Reid.

That’s what Madonna did to the
demo. And the phoned-in Lil’ Wayne
cameo does the song no favors.

She took the vocals a few keys
lower, masked them with Auto-'I\me

andcrankedupirritatinglysharpsym

thesizer beats to the point where it’s a
wonder your ears don’t literally bleed
after one chorus.

It’s like Britney Spears’ “Radar” if
Britney downed three bottles of Robi-
tussin before the recording session.

Regardless of how disappointed I
am that such an incredible song was
driven 6 feet under, the real tragedy
here is how many talented artists miss
the opportunity to get big because a
bigger pop act steals (and then craps
on) theirthunder. I’ve neverheard any-
thing else by Ravaughn, but judging

by the demo of “Revolver,” the girl has
potential.

Unfortunately, shewillberelegated
as an underling to the stars, and Ma-

dom1a’s “Revolver” will probably still ,

grow immensely popular because ul-
timately, it’s too catchy not to become
a hit.

I justwish itcouldbeRaVaughnwho .

got some of the glory.

Ambler to
focus on  
recruiting

Randy Lieberman
Senior Staﬁ’ Writer

As the Pitt women’s volleyball team
tries to develop into an NCAA

' Tournament regular, it needs not '

only great players and coaching, but
great recriiiting. V . ‘

‘ Luckily for Pitt, it  that with
assistant coach Eysha Ambler.

Pitt coach Toby Rens hired
Ambler t_his_]uly as one of two Pitt
assistant coaches. _

V‘ Rens discovered Ambler because
of recruiting competitions they’ve .
hadinthe past. .

T “I’ve recruited against herj’

l Rens said, “She always recruited by
‘ herselfreally well.”

Ambler.’s value to Pittwill be
felt most along the recruiting trail,

" where she started assistirig Pitt this

summer.

?‘I am in the junior college area
and the South, around Alabama and
Georgia,” Ambler said, ‘Alot of good

3 players come out of there.”

To her, recruiting is an aspect of
coaching that she enjoys.

“I enjoy it, but sometimes the
travel is kind of tough,” Ambler said.

- “But it sure pays offin the long run.”

Ambler is in her ﬁrst year with

‘Pitt afteraﬁve-year stint with
i Tennessee State University. During

her tenure as an assistant coach,
Ambler led the Lady Tigers to two '
Ohio Valley Conference titles and

. the program’s ﬁrst NCAA Tourna-

ment appearance. During her time,
she served as  coordinator
and volleyball operations director;
and she aided students with their
academic progress.

Ambler is somewhat of a legend
at her alma mater,]ac_ksonville
State University. By the time she '
graduated in 2001, Ambler was the
school’s ﬁrst three-sport letterman

probably as good ofapasseraswhattl1ey’vehad

way [Navy] got back in the Ohio State game was
because of [Dobbs’] passing ability.”

Dobbs ranksﬁrst on theteaminpassing (759

has six combined touchdowns for the Midship-

It wasn’t something Rens over-
looked.

“Her experience level as a player
and coach helps her to relate to
the players and assist them in their
process of being a student—athlete,”
Rens said. _ .

Ambler mostly handles respon-'
sibilities on the business side of
the program, such as dealing with
recruiting, team travel and game day
operations. ‘

But Ambler also works directly
with the middle blockers in prac-
tices.

“she’s helpful in so many differ-
ent areas,” Rens said. “Recruiting
is deﬁnitely oneof the things she
does really well, but she’s very well-
respected and received by the team

A and has a really great positive energy

to her. She’s a really great example
for all the players on the team.”
Even for someone moving from

the South to the Northeast for the
ﬁrst time, Ambler said she’s adjust-
ing pretty well.

“It was a little tough because Ten-
nessee is pretty ﬂat,” Ambler said.
“But it’s so beautiﬁil here. I’m only
scared of when it’s time for snow.”

Ambler said it’s easier than some
would think to recruit players from
the South to Pitt, mostly because of
the school’s academic reputation.

“Kids from the South will come

here just because you can’t go wrong
with this school,” Ambler said.
Rens is easy to compliment

Ambler’s personality and work ethic K

in her immediate success at Pitt.

“She’s a lot of fun to be around
and really complements me well,”
Rens said. “She’s an integral part of
the staff. She’s someone you enjoy
working with and has an incredible
work ethic and great perspective on
things.”

Kieran Layton, Samatha Stahl
A & E Editor; Columnist

Editor’s note: Everybody has their
own limitswhen itcomes to drinking.
Our reporters were careﬁll to pace
themselves at a rate beneath their
respective tolerance levels and prac-
ticingothersafety methods such asby
drinkingonly some ofeach drink they
tasted throughout the evening.

On a random Monday night, A& E
editor Kieran Layton and staffwriter
Samantha Stahl decided to attempt
the impossible: hit up eight of the most
popular South Oakland bars in aspan
of four hours.

This is their story.

Kieran:

Heming’way’s Café
3911 Forbes Ave.
412-621-4100

Sam and I strolled into Hem-
ingway’s Cafe at 8:50 p.m. with our
stomachs rumbling and our thirsts
ready to be quenched. The lighting
was dark, and the Buffalo Billsvs. New
England Patriots game was on —~ the

 

   

 

testosterone in the bar was at an al-
most unbearable level. Despite the
dark lighting and initially confusing
service (you have to tell the hostess
if you want to eat), the surprise of a
half-price menu served from 9 p.m.
to midnight eased my anxiety. The
waitress didn’t give us the prompt-
est of service, but it ultimately was a
blessingbecause we gotto breachthe
9 p.m. half-price deadline.

I ordered a pitcher of shots -
the new gummy bear ﬂavor -. for an
astoundingly cheap $6. The potency
of the drinks establishes Hem’s as a
great place to golfor those looking
for a wallet—f'riendly drink that isn’t
afraid to let you taste the liquor in it.
My Cajun chicken wrap was perfectly
seasoned, and the Cardiac Stix (moz-
zarella sticks doused in buffalo sauce,
melted cheese and bacon) made my

taste buds scream with joy and my _

arteries cry out of cholesterol suffo-
cation.

After growing ﬁill of delicious
bar food and candy-ﬂavored shots, I
ﬁgured it was ﬁme to move on to the
next bar. 6

Peter’s Pub
116 Oakland Ave.
412-681-7465

We walked into Peter’s Pub at 9:52
p.m. and were instantly surprised by
the lack of crowd. On any given week-

end night, this seems to be a student
favorite, and the line typically extends
out the door. _

On Monday, however, I found a
less—than-half—f'ull bar that mimicked
Hemingway’s in game night atmo-
sphere. There was a noticeable num-
ber of older patrons, but it didn’t de-
tractfromthe hometownbarvibethat
contributes to Peter’s popularity.

The special included 30 cent wings
and $1.75 Yuenglingbottles, andwhile
my stomach couldn’t handle anymore
barfood, I indulgedinacrisp andper—
fectly cold brew. Sam ordered avodka
cranberry that came in a small glass
and tasted watery. V

While Peter’s still hands out the
iconic Viking horns forthose celebrat-
ing their 21st birthdays (or if you just
ask nicely enough), the bar does not
allowthose celebratingtheirlegal—age
birthdays to indulge before midnight,
contrary to popular belief. This is a
small setback for those turning 21,
however, as there will be plenty of
nights for them to legally destroy
their livers. ’

Pittsburgh Café

, 226 Meyran Ave.

412-637-3331

 

The next stop was Pittsburgh Café,
better known amongthe student body
as “P Caf,” and at 10:09, Sam and I
were still going strong. Though pa-
trons are greeted by a quaint outdoor
patio, the inside of the bar shifts to a
very chic modem-deco scheme. There
is an upstairs area that blasts Top 40
hits on weekends, and it often invites
local bands to play on weekdays.

Iordered anAbsolutma11;ini, extra .
dry,forareasonable $8.50, andthere
was some initial CO1‘1ﬁ1SlOI1 between
the bartender and I about what con-
sﬁtutes a “dry” martini (it’s a martini
with no olive brine). Itwas served up
strong, though, and Sam andlheaded
out to the patio to enjoy one of the
last temperate nights we are likely to
experience in Pittsburgh.

The concept of the patio at a bar
is ingenious — it’s almost impossible

' not to have a good conversation while

observing (and occasionally eaves-

' dropping) on the fellow patrons. Sam

and I discussed howwe should do the
bar crawl more often, if only for the
sole reason of spicing up nightlife in
Oakland.

and music allows for a comfort-
able setting.

Pizza Sola also offers salads
and a variety of delectable chick-

something other than pizza. For
bargain hunters, here’s the heads

Sorrento’s is one of those local
places that all students should
visit at least once. It has a spa-

Italian eatery menu, complete
with the classic pizzas, pastas
and subs. It’s locally renowned
special is a $5 large cheese pizza
that hungry students can pick
up after 8 p.m. during the week.
Over the weekends, the $5 deal
stands all day Saturday, so catch
it before they close on Sunday.
Voted one of the best pizza places

Antoon’s shares Atwood
Street with multiple other Oak.-
land pizza shops including its ri-
val, Sorrento’s. Its business ploy
is to sell a $4.90 (with tax) large
cheese pizza as well as keep its
doors open later over the week-
end. Since it always has a crowd
accumulating outside its doors,

it seems to work. The menu at
Antoon’s is pretty evened out to
accommodate a variety of pizze-
ria favorites. The ﬂavor seems to
be hit or miss depending on who
orders what and personal taste,
but Antoon’s isa favorite among
those with limited cash, no mat-

calling in advance before coming

Though Pittsburgh’s Downtown seems to bustle from 9—to—5 on weekdays and ‘"
otherwise remain largely unoccupied, the quantity of people that pass through the
Golden Triangle make it an important dining destination. The key demographic of

‘ “Dahntahn” is the businessperson,so the local fare tends to cater to those looking
for a quick bite or a classy meal with clients. Downtown is home to many of the city’s
ﬁner restaurants, such as Ruth’s Chris and Morton’s, two steakhouses that aren’t
exactly college haunts. Like Shadyside, however, Downtown is an excellent place to
take your parentsqor a romantic interest. The Cultural District, the areaaround the
theatres and Convention Center is particularly laden with places to snag a nice meal
without breaking the bank, such as Tambellini’s and Christos’. Elsewhere Downtown,
students can ﬁnd less formal fare including Sammy’s Famous Corned Beef and even a

The Pitt News ’ Tour de Oakland

Do those ‘bars have as much ambience as we all think?

UncleJimmy’s
418 Semple St.
412-681-7480

Alter leaving P Caf, we ventured down Mey-
ran Ave. and onto Semple St, past Mellinger’s
Beer Distributor to enter the more dive—ish bar
section of South Oakland. UncleJimmy’s isthe
quintessential dive bar — it’s smoky and unpre-
tentious, but unfortlmately not that cheap.

The bartender was nowhere to befound for
the ﬁrst ﬁve minutes of our stay, and Sam and I
each grewalittle uncomfortable observing some
patrons who were most deﬁnitely not college
students. Finally, I got to order a double vodka
tonic, served in a large pint glass for the mod-
erate price of $6.00. The double proved to be
a good choice, as the single is served in a very
tiny glass and averages around $3.25 for most
well drinks. ' '

Uncle Jimmy’s has a dart board and pool
tables for people who like bars with plenty to
do, and there were odd slot machinevideo games
ﬁning onewall. One drawingfactorfor the baris
the ability to smoke inside — a rare treat these
days for Oakland smokers. The touchscreen juke-
box surprisingly played some good tunes, even
more surprisinglypickedby ourfellowpatrons.
Though Uncle Jimmy’s would not be my ﬁrst

3 choice ofbar, it maybe the perfectplace ifyou are

in a very particular, yet grungy, nightlife mood.

Bootleggers

403 Semple Street
412-488-2668

. 11:24p.m.: .

I have this policy —— if you’re over the ag
of28, you probably shouldn’t be at an Oakland
college bar. There are plenty of other options
around Pittsburgh that are not populated by the
barely—1egal crowd.

Bootleggers, however, seemingly deﬁes this
law of physics. Here, the crowd enters into the
30s and 40s range. '

Some guy down the bar keeps staring at me,
but I get over it because the drinks are cheap:
$3 for my vodka and tonic and $4 for Kieran’s
Jack and Coke.

‘ There are specials for each day of the week.

_ Unforumately, we didn’t notice the giant poster

looming over us until we’d already ordered.
Mondays boast $5 bombs. Too bad we missed
them. '

Spice Café . .
328 Atwood St.
412-682-1900

11:50 p.m.: —
Tonight, Spice Café is peaceful. It’s quite
enough for us to play Nancy Drew and solve a
text message mystery (you know, when you get
a message froman unknown number and then
won’t saywho it is?). There’s plenty of open seat-
ing. Alonely pizza spins around aheater atop the

bar. Some tribal-looking masks peer down atus ~

from their perch on the wall.

Ordinarily, however, Spice’s drink specials
and live music pack a pretty big crowd. We in-
dulged in the $2.50 Captain Morgan specials,
but if that’s notyourthing, I’cl highly recommend
their frozen long islands. For $5 you can pick
from peach, strawberry, mango, raspberry or
pineapple. It’s like 21 slushy for big kids.

place is notoriously one of the strictest bars in 3’
