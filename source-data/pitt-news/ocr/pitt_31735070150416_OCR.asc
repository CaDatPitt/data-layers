A presidential race is between
two people. One Republican and
one'Democrat always have their
names on the ballot, wind up
receiving the majority of media
coverage and TV airtime and are
often the only names_recognized.

But what if you don’t like ei-
ther of them? <

“If you’re voting for evil, you
can’t be surprisedwhen things

» get worse. Voting for a third

party can be different. It’s draw-
ing enough votes away fromthe
Democrats and Republicans to
make a statement, showing that
there’s a discontent,” said Jamie

McKibbin, president of Pitt’s Lib— _

ertarian club.

{But because third party candi-
dates rarely make it into the po-
litical spotlight, educating one-
self about alternative presidential
prospects canibecome tough.
This year there was a multitude
of prominent options: Jill Stein
of the Green Party, Garyjohnson
of the Libertarian Party, Rocky
Anderson of the Justice Party and
Jerry White of the Socialist Equal-
ity Party._ -But frequently labeled
as extremist by the media, they
fell to the wayside.

Thirdparties candidates often
have trouble even getting onto
the ballot. This year, indepen-
dent candidates needed more
than 20,000 valid signatures to
get on the Election Day ballot in

Pennsylvania. Democratic and

, Republican candidates only need-

ed to garner 2,000 signatures to.
the same end. ‘

And when third—party can-
didates do acquire the neces-
sary signatures, they struggle to
spread their messages through
mainstream media.

The most successful third-
party candidate, Ralph Nader,

_only won 2.75 percent of the na-

, tional vote when he ran as the

Green Party candidate in 2000.
But even Nader couldn’t muster
enough support to make it onto
the debate stage with Democratic
candidate Al Gore and Republican
contender George W. Bush that
year. To qualifyfor the debates,

' the Commission on Presidential
Debates says a candidate must . .

have support from 15 percent of

‘ Voters.

So why-do third party candi-
dates even run?

“We’re challenging you to
think,” said Phyllis Scherrer,
the vicépresidential nominee for
the Socialist Equality Party. “The
election itself is a means to an
end —— it’s not the ultimate goal.
The goal is to create awareness
about our questions.”

Scott Morgenstern, an asso-
ciate professor in the political
science department, concurred.

“I think [thirdparty candi-
dates] recognize there’s little
chance of winning,” he said.

Morgenstern added that run-

a new wrench to pry from the
gears of scheduling: They have
to ﬁnd different tires for the
2012-2013 season. That’s be-
cause on Sept. 13, Goodyear, a
tire manufacturer and long—time

sponsor of the Formula SAE col-

legiate program, pulled its 13-
inch tires from the competition.
“It was obvious based on
the research we’ve done if we
wanted to remain competitive,
we should have developed a 10-
inch tire,” Goodyear spokesman
Kerry Christopher said, refer-
ring to the 10-inch tire diameter.
After determining that fu-
ture production of the 10-inch
tires or the already popular 13-
inch tires would not make cost-
benefit sense, Goodyear ceased
production of Formula SAE tires
altogether. “We have not made
any [Formula SAE tires] at this
point,” Christopher said.

Tournament organizer SAE
International estimates this
change could substantially af-
fect the 24 percent of compet-
ing teams that used Goodyear
13-inch tires in 2012.

But the significance of teams
having to procure different tires
might be lost on all but car gu-
rus. For folks uninitiated into
the ethos of automotive enthu-
siasm, tires might appear as rub-
ber afterthoughts in the context
of other car parts -- e.g., en-
gine, axle.

On the contrary, Pitt’s For-
mula team contends that tires
deserve more respect.

“The tires are the only way
that the car is connected to the
ground,” said club president Ste-
ven Karkenny, emphasizing how
tires must stabilize several tons
of weight with about as much
surface area as a pair of shoe
soles.

Given the intimate relation-
ship between tires and the road,
“One of the things we design the
car around is the tires,” he said.
“You want to make sure you de-
sign your car so that it uses [the
tires’] grip to its full potential.”

Like the premise of al logi-
cal proof, tires form the basis
from which all design decisions

follow, so changing tire brands
after four months into the 2012-
2013 design process amounts to
no minor substitution.

“Each tire, depending on
the manufacturer, has differ-
ent properties,” Karkenny said.
“They react in different ways.
The way that they grip the road
can be a little bit different, and
the positions that they like to be
in can be different.”

The position that tires “like”
refers to the optimal slip angles
that typify tires. When the steer-
ing wheel turns while a car is in
motion, all tires slip to some de-
gree, meaning that the direction
of the car’s resulting movement
differs from the front wheels’
intended direction. This differ-
ence in direction deﬁnes the slip

angle, which varies between tire
types and, under changing force
conditions, within a single tire
type.

Therefore, the main goal of
designing the car’s structural
frame “is to keep the tire at the
correct slip angle and to keep
it so that as much tire is con-
tacting the ground as possible,”
Karkenny said. “It’s a big geom-
etry problem.”

Getting over the hump
Solving that geometry prob-

lem will consume much of the
Pitt Formula‘group’s focus over

the next few weeks. The team

must collaboratively pore over
data on the new tires — regard-
ing slip angles and other mea-
sures — then plug those data
into computer simulations and
make necessary adjustments
to the car design. Despite the
novelty of the tire dilemma and
the time pressures it implies
for testing the car on the track,
Frank is hopeful.

“We’re always troubleshoot_- _

ing, always ﬁnding problems
and finding ways to fix them,”
he said.

Fran.k’s hope might stem

from the vast resources Pitt SAE
has at its disposal. In addition to

THIRD PARTY

ning a campaign is a costly expenditure,
and laws created by the main parties have
made it even more difficult to run.

. Thus, he said, candidates frequently
run simply to gain publicity for their pro-
grams, position themselves for other jobs
and stake out positions on national issues.

Even though no third-party candi-
dates will be included in the debates this
year, McKibbin still suggests becoming
informed and educated about alternative
platforms.

Morgenstern agreed, urging potential
nonvoters to research before making a
decision. V

“They should learn about issues they . ‘

care about, and what each party’s views
are. It may be that you don’t like either of
the dominant parties, but students need
to be aware of the relevant issues,” Mor-
genstern said. “It matters whatthe leader
of this country and the free world thinks.”
Mckibbin agreed that voters should
cast their ballots intelligently. "
“If you’re going to vote, vote on princi-
ple,” Mckibbin said. “Voting for evil, lesser
or greater, is throwing away the.vote.” I

RACE CAR S

'Karkenny said.

However, money, space and fancy

equipment don’t spawn race cars on their

own. Led by a cadre of student veterans
and faculty adviser William Slaughter,
about 50 engineering undergrads provide
that link in 2012.

Operating as a kind of collegiate cot-
tage industry, Pitt SAE features a network
of masters and apprentices working to-
gether to create and preserve knowledge
and practices across generations of stu-
dents. Sophomore _Ali Schroer, new to
the club, experiences the apprentice side
ﬁrsthand. '

“I’ll come down whenever I don’t have
class, provided someone else is down
here who knows what they’re doing and
can give me ajob,” Schroer said.

Without expecting paychecks or vic-
tory at the competition, club members
commit large personal investments,” es-
pecially as May ‘approaches.

“We spend plenty of a1l—nighters down
here,” said drive-train subteam leader

.Conturo, noting how members commonly‘

lose track of time. “We just know by when
Pandora shuts off.”
Students burn midnight candles in

. the name of automotive engineering for
. various reasons. The love of competition

drives some.
“Being able to design something and

‘show up with something that can com-

pete with those teams and those other
engineers that are all brilliant is kind of

’a neat experience,” Frank said.

Thoughts of future jobs drive others,
as club involvement has provided former

-Pitt SAE members with marketable skills

in private industry.

“Since its conception 27 years ago,
everyone who’s been a senior member of
the club has had a job when they gradu-
ated,” said senior chemical engineering
major Andrew Decker, who also leads
the club’s aerodynamics and ergonomics
subteam. “1oo percent job placement.”

‘ Building race cars in college also ex-
citesstudents on an intellectual level.
That’s especially true for Schroer. Much
like the brain scientist stands agape at the
bewildering complexity of his neurologi-

I cal subject, Schroer derives enjoyment

out of making the car the object of her
curiosity. .
“Whenever someone hands me some-

" thing new, and it’s got a bajillion andone

things going on, I want to know exactly
what’s going on with every single little
thing,” she said. “And it’s nice because
this car offers inﬁnitely many chance
to do that.” V , _ -
For Karkenny, who’s_been with the club

for four years, driving the final product ~

tops his list of motivators‘.

“Being at the limit of control, I love
that feeling,” he said, noting how last
year’s car,could acc‘el’erate from zero to
60 miles per hour in 3.5 seconds. “Imag-
ine a rollercoaster that you can control.”

Pitt Students for Life discusses federal
abortion funding and right to life

Pitt News Staff

On Friday, Oct. 5, representatives
from Pitt Students for Life met with
staff from The Pitt News to discuss
issues concerning women’s health.

For them, the debate over abor-
tion and federally mandated contra-
ception coverage centers on one thing
only: protecting the life of an unborn
child, who they see as deserving the
rights afforded to anybody else.

 this in mind, the group en-
dorses presidential candidate Mitt
Romney, believing he will do more
thanPresident Barack Obamainpro—
tecting the rights of unborn children.
The group cites his support of the
HydeAmendment—— arider attached
to certain appropriation bills to pre-
vent taxpayer funding for abortions
— as well as his opposition to Roe v.
Wade and his plan to end funding for
Plarmed Parenthood.

The group goes furtherthan Rom-
ney, however, aligning more closely
with his running mate, Wisconsin
Rep.'Paul Ryan, by seeking an end to
all abortions, even in cases of rape

or incest.

This position, while more philo-
sophically consistent than softer
stances, is unpopular: Only 20 per-
cent of Americans oppose abortion
in all circumstances, according to
Gallup. Even Romney, in recent days,
has begun moderating his position
on abortion.

The Pitt News talked with repre-
sentatives Elizabeth Ciccocioppo and

- Jake Schreiber about their positions

and their perspectives on the election.
Below are some edited excerpts ofthe
conversation. . -
The Pitt News: What is your
group’s position on the 2012 presi-
dential election? '
Jake: Our group is in support of
Mitt Romney. We are pro-life. We be-
lieve a person is a person, no matter
how small, and we believe that abor-
tion is wrong and should be illegal.
TPN: What instances do you ﬁnd
of federal funding for abortions?
Jake: Obamacare, which Mitt
Romney will repeal, has a lot of
money being donated to Plarmed
Parenthood. Planned Parenthood
performs alarge portion of abortions

in America, so that is a lot of money
going towards abortions.

TPN: What about all the other
things Planned Parenthood does?
Would Gov. Romney provide an al-
ternative to Plarmed Parenthood if
all of it were cut?

Elizabeth: There are already
other places for people. Right here
in Pittsburgh, there is a place on Craig
Street called Women’s Choice Net-
work. They provide free ultrasounds,
informwomen they are pregnant and
STD testing. They do all that stuff,
except abortions. All their services
are free. ,

ON EXCEPTIONS FOR RAPE OR
HEALTH OF MOTHER

TPN: If we get to a place where
abortion istotally illegal, what should
happento womenwho get abortions
illegally? What should be the legal

_ consequences?

Jake: We see the child, the fetus we
see as a human person with rights.
We believe that rights are taken away
during abortion, which is a murder. ~
There would be legal consequences,
obviously. When a pregnant woman
is murdered, we see a double murder

    Campus Women’s Organization
° ‘discusses women’s health and rights

Pitt News Staff

' Recently a representative from the
Campus Women’s Organization at Pitt
metwith The Pitt News Opinions staff
to discuss women’s rights and the up-
coming election.

While CWO is a nonpartisan
group and does not endorse any
speciﬁc candidate, its members are
concerned with women’s health and
reproductive rights and funding for
the protection of these rights.

We talked to CWO President Bella
Salamone about these issues.

THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES

The Pitt News: What is the group’s
position on the 2012 national‘ elec-
tion? _

V Bella Salamone: We’re anonparti—
san organization, so we’re not afIili-

‘ ated with apolitical party. So our job
isn’t to tell members who to vote for.
What we’re really trying to do is to
provide information to our general

body about how candidates feel about I

women’s and reproductive rights.

TPN: What would you say to some-
one who is making their voting deci-
sion based on the factthat theythink
abortion is morally wrong?

BS: I ﬁnd that to be an incredibly
simplistic response to avery compli-
cated issue. Morally, I have an issue
with a social structure where we have
children who don’t have homes, and
we have women giving birth to chil-
dren because they’ve been raped, and
we end up with a foster system that
doesn’twork. We have lower—income
women suffering because they can’t
have access to abortions.

TPN: So do you think then that

' there’samiddle ground atallbetween

these two viewpoints? How do you
start bridgingthat? .

BS: I think everybody can agree
thatunplanned pregnancyisthe place
to start. So you’re talking about posi-
tive sex education, like getting rid of
abstinence-only sex education and

putting in comprehensive sex educa-
tion in schools. Access to birth con-
trol and just generally ﬁghting against
unwanted pregnancy will get us to
the place where we can have a new
discussion about abortion and come
together a little bit.

CRIMINALIZATION or ABOR'I‘ION

TPN: Do youthinkthatthe crimi-
nalization of abortionswilllimit abor-
tions?

BS: I think the criminalization of
abortions will lead to dead women,
and that’s aproblem. .

TPN: So do you ﬁnd the, life of a
woman who’s already alive to be more
valuable than that of a fetus?

BS: Yes, I do. Because I think that
the issue with the way that we’re cen-
tering the talk about abortion now
is that we’re weighing women’s lives
againstunborn children and for some
reasonthe unborn children keep win-
ning.

charge. We could see abortions as a murder
charge. That is a life inside.

2TPN: What about health exemptions? Should
there be exceptions if the health of the mother
is at stake?

Jke Screiber and Elizabeth Ciccocioppo share their views. Claire Deahl | Staff Photog-

rapher

Elizabeth: If there is a problem with the preg-
nancy, where themother or child could die, the
hospital should do everything it can to save the
mother and child. If one must die, the hospital
will normally choose the life of the mother.

TPN: Do you think that is a morally accept-
able solution?

Elizabeth: You’re not deliberately taking the

life of either. You are saving as many as you can. i

TPN: What if there is a 90 percent chance
the woman will die if they don’t abort the baby?

Jake: We are getting back to the life of the
childbeing sacriﬁced for another life. It is judg-
ing which life is more valuable, essentially. Ev-
erything should be done in the power of the
doctors to save both lives. One life cannot be
saved to sacriﬁce the other.

TPN: Do you think the government should
say that if you have a 90 percent chance of dying,
you can’t have that abortion option?

Elizabeth: Yes

Jake: We are getting to legal terms. If it’s il-
lgeal to kill ahuman being, and afetus, who we
believe is a person, is killed, then yes.

TPN: What would you do about the fact the
number of illegal, unsafe abortions may in-
crease? How do you propose the government
deal with this?

Jake: Here’s the problem we have. Right now
we have tax dollars funding legal abortions. We
have the ability to get a free abortion and walk
out free. By makingit illegal, we’cl also limit the
possibility of any ﬁinds goingtoward‘abort1'on.
Technically, by paying taxes, some of my tax

dollars are going towards abortions. I’rn paying '
for somethingl don’t believe is right.

_ The fact that taxpayers are supporting them
is disgusting. You [shouldn’t] get an abortion
free on our taxpayer dollars, even if it is better
for the female’s health when compared to a
back-alley abortion.

IN HEALTHCARE
TPN: If an institution is morally opposed to
contraception, where does the government get
the right to mandate providing contraception
to awoman who isworking at Hobby Lobby or
Chick-ﬁl—A? How can the government force a
organization to do something it is opposed to?
BS: So let’s take this back a couple decades,
and let’stalkaboutbusinesses being morally op-
posed to hiring people of color and then having
to do it because there has been a general deci-
sion that collectively we as America are giving
rights to people. So you are a small business,
and you can decide whatever you want, but
you are providing a public service, and so we
are mandating you hire people, regardless of
your moral opinion of the color of their skin.
Now we are shifting ahead.
TPN: Isn’t that a rhetorical fallacy to say that
hiring people of color is analogous to providing
contraception?

BS: I was using it as a general analogy on '

how people’s moral ideologies shift in relation
to their government, and it’s the easiest one to
chose. I’m not trying to imply contraception
and racism are at all on the same level, but busi-
nesses can make moral decisions to a certain

point until the government tells them, “You A

are infringing on the rights of a certain group
of people with your decisions, and that is not
OK.” Then the business has to comply.

ON PRO—LIFE VS. PRO—CHOICE

TPN: But could you say you are pro-life in
that you’d prefer those babies had not been
conceived? You’d just prefer they be able to
choose contraception methods from Planned
Parenthood.

“Looper”

’Directed by: Rian Johnson
Starring: Joseph Gordon-
Levitt, Bruce Willis, Emily
Blunt
Grade: A-

In regard to his film history,
Joseph Gordon-Levitt is a new-
comer to the time—traveling and
gunslinging scene.

The heartthrob, who recently
played up his sex appeal as the
host of “Saturday Night Live,”
seems to enter foreign territory
in the futuristic action thriller
“Looper.” It doesn’t help that
the actor, whose pain we all felt
in the romantic comedy “(5oo)
Days of Summer,” sports a cos—

metically altered nose in order
to more closely resemble his
futuristic doppelganger, played
by Bruce Willis. The result is an
awkward fusion of Keanu Reeves
and Al Pacino.

It would be easy to write off
a ﬁlm with such unfortunately
comedic makeup decisions, but
the movie’s saving grace is the
tightly written and impossibly
compelling screenplay by Rian
Johnson, who also directed the

Gordon-Levitt takes on new role, nose in ‘Looper’

ﬁlm.

The ﬁlm is set in a dystopian
2044 that takes a view of the
future more akin to “Children
of Men” than “I, Robot,” with
settings and scenery far less
fantastic and, in a lot of ways,
anachronistic. This makes the
focus of the plot that much more
surreal. In the ﬁlm, time travel
has been perfected and is used
almost exclusively by the mob.

Claiming “honl<y—tonk surf
rock ‘n’ roll” as agenre would
be pure creative ambition for
most bands. _ i

_ But for guitarist Frank Hoier
and drummer Moselle Spiller,
it’s just calling it like it is. 

Members of the band Crushed Out release an album that draws on
a variety of music.

Splashing ontothe scene in
a grungy swell of lo—ﬁ energy,
indie—rock duo Crushed Out
wails, shreds and generally has
a crashing good _time on its debut
LP, Want to Give. Set for release
Nov. 6, the album ranges from
electric blues to garage rock as it
explores themes of fame, anger,
generosity and the excitement
of attending a Black Sabbath
concert in 10 energetic tracks.

Grade: B

According to legend, one day,
when gathering ﬂowers in a ﬁeld,
the goddess Persephone was ab-

, ducted andheld captive in the un-

derworld by Hades. Grief and pan-
ic seized Demeter, Persephone’s
mother. And in her search for her
daughter, she froze the earth, in-
ﬂicted it with her depression and
turned the land barren, devoid of
the capacity to sustain life.

This is how Greek mythology
explains the change in seasons and
the exaltations of joy and upset
for which they are responsible.
Emotion, the Greek mused, is re-
ﬂected most honestly and purely
in nature.

Lee/amzz/, Dana Falconberry’s
new album, has its genius rooted
in this same doctrine, and she
uses her lyricism with the aid of
complex symphonies and strings
of basic folk to paint a landscape,
the beautiful and tumultuous
complexities that echo the plagu-
ing challenges of human life. Of
course, this is a difficult task. If
life is a stage, Falconberry’s duty
is to deconstruct it — inject each
actor, meticulously set, piece and
line them with signiﬁcance.

The album’s lead song “Birch
Bark” admits, even embraces, this

‘ difﬁculty. It begins with a confused

percussion and an unsure warm-
up of a violin and base, pulling
from the work of Phil Collins and
Mark Mancina where the divorced
sounds of instruments build into a
union of song. By the time Falcon-

Sports broadcasting stems
from passionate standards 1

Corey Eisenberg
WPTS Contributor

There was a special basketball game that took
place at the Petersen Events Center in 2010.
It was the Backyard Brawl — an annual game
between Pitt and West Virginia — and it cap-
tivated the audience’s attention. With his team

trailing late, Ashton Gibbs hitas.-pointer to send ‘

the game into overtime. I had the privilege of
broadcasting this three—oVertime classic. I still
remember the way the crowd erupted when

Gibbs hit that shot and the passion that I poured ‘

into my coverage of the game.

During broadcasts like this one, student an— .

nouncers have the opportunity to trytheir hands

at play—by—play and color commentary for their.

favorite sports. Broadcasting university athletic
events is an essential component of having a
smdent-run radio station. Given that WPTS-is
predominantly a music station, the sports cov-
erage on Pitt’s student—operated radio station
provides listeners with a change of pace. The

games are broadcasted live — a special aspect of '

sports coverage that allows for alevel of surprise
and a break from the mundane. Capturing this
spontaneity is a vital part of radio broadcasts.

Through my experiences broadcasting Pitt
sporting events, I have come up with three key
concepts Vital for any student who wants to try
sports broadcasting: motivation, preparation
and entertainment. '

Motivation

  
 

Ashton Gibbs makes sports broadcasting exciting with his moves. MCT Campus

There are a handful of Pitt students who
grew up wanting to be sports announcers, idol-
izingﬁgures like Chris Berman and Dickvitale.
I used to be one of those kids who would play
sports Video games and announce the action as
it happened on the screen.

Whether or not this was a part of your child-
hood routine, it’s important for a sports broad-
caster to demonstrate a level of passion for the
sport he covers. Broadcasts shouldn’t feel like

' work; covering these games should be an enjoy-

able experience.

The difference between play—by—play and
color commentary is very simple. Most broad-
casts feature two announcers, one to provide
each. The play-by-play announcer is responsible
for describing the action that occurs during the
game. On the radio, it’s especially important to
paint a picture for listeners because they can’t
see what is happening on the court or the ﬁeld.
The color commentator must then analyze and
interpret what is going on during the game after
each play.

In myexperience, I have contributed both
play—by—play and color commentary for football
and basketball. Play—by-play armouncing is more
difﬁcult, because the announcer has to be re-
ally descriptive with words to make sure he or
she is accurately illustrating the game. I enjoy
both jobs and am always motivated to put on a
successful broadcast regardless of whether I

LOOPER

Gordon—Levitt plays a contract killer
or “looper” named Joe, whose job is to
‘murder “problems” sent to'the past from
the future. Joe goes about this job rela-

. tively smoothly, having no problem vio-

lently shooting his targets as they arrive
at the location.

The plot shifts whenjoe recognizes the
hit he is ordered to kill —=— himself. The
olderjoe, sent from 30 years in the future
and played by Bruce Willis, quickly takes

' advantage of his unwillingness to shoot

his future self and manages to escape.
As difficult as the situation might be to
grasp, the cleverly written script allows
the plot twists — and there are several
— to feel entirely organic.

Film nerds will be pleasedwith the
numerous allusions to Jean-Luc Godard
—— the -famous French—Swiss ﬁlm director
who had a large impact on modern cin-
ema — and the shrewdly named meeting
places, worthy of a chuckle from any ﬁlm
studies professor.

Botched nose work aside, Gordon-
Levitt enters into the unfamiliar territory

of sci—ﬁ thriller quite well, incorporating
his seemingly natural charm while main-
taining the ﬁlm’s die-hard tone. Willis
acts like a typical Bruce Willis character,
and the veteran actor plays his role well,
guiding the ﬁlm’s younger star through

‘ the world of sci-ﬁ gunslinging.

.The movie unravels as Joe must ﬁnd
and kill his future self before the mob
kills him in the present, however, the
future Joe has secrets to reveal that lead
to a much darker revelation. “Termina—
tor” parallels aside,]ohnson manages to
work within familiar themes and create
a unique and wildly entertaining ﬁlm. I

CRUSHED

phrase inspiredby Spiller’s natural abil— ‘

ity to play the drums. The pair’s first
release, a 20-minute EP titled Show P072},
debuted in 2010. I

, Want to Give continues in the same
lively, distortion—heavy style as the EP,
combining strong inﬂuences from The
White Stripes’ successful composition

and fuzzy sound with a definitive surf V

vibe that harkens back to ’6os-era rock ‘n’
roll in the vein of Bob Dylan. The album
is anything but narrow in its influences.
Afew songs have an even older sound,
reminiscent of rockabilly artists such

as Buddy_Holly, yet Hoier’s vocals stay '

decidedly modern, high and almost ee-

- rie like those of Cold War Kids’ Nathan

Willett. ‘

Although its lyrics aren’t weak, Want
to Gz‘ve’s strength lies in its‘ songs’ pure
ease of listening —'— the result of Hoier’s
melodic, and occasionally frantic, guitar
riffs in conjunction with Spiller’s boister-
ously spirited drumming. The ﬁnal prod-
uct is a varied selection of blues-infused
rock that manages to remain consistently
good-natured even while dishing out the
honky—tonk attitude. -

If the album has a shortcoming, it’s
that the band does little to distinguish
itself from its many inﬂuences. Although
it includes an impressive variety of song

approaches, Want to Give lacks a deﬁning

ﬂair. Many of its songs will stick with
listeners throughout the day, but none
particularly invite singing along. Even so,
the album’s eponymous track and other
tracks such as “Weigh You Down” and
“Black and Purple” contain considerable
character, and these strengths could eas-
ily morph into a signature style as the

band, continues to develop.

Crushed Out plays Saturday at Garﬁeld
Artworks on Penn Avenue in Garfield.
The show begins at 8 p.m. and will also
include sets from The Hounds Below,
White Like Fire and New Vegas.

And if the tracks on Want to Give are

_ any indication, Hoier and Spiller not only

want to give — they also have plenty to
offer. I

FALCONBERRY

berry ﬁnishes uncovering banished feelings
and reacquainting herself with lost lovesﬁa
full band, orchestra and choir swells behind
her and eventually overwhelms her when
the words of the story have been exhausted.

Album centerpiece “Petoskey Stone” and
the track “Crooked River” are perfect ex-

amples of Fa.lconberry’s reminiscence. Both,__

songs insist that we are forever grounded
by places and events and that when way-

ward, sad or confused, they can lead us to a _

reprieve, as the North Star directs the lost
at night, as Falconberry’s music meshed
into one. “And in my left hand / a Petoskey
stone,” Falconberry sings, the fossil carry-
ing a reminder of her childhood home in
Leelanau, Mich. And, Falconberry promises,

that when away from home and on a seem- ’

ingly insurmountable and inconsequential
journey, the “Crooked River,”. will always
ﬁnd the sea. 9 .1

There’s something of Edward Sharpe &
The Magnetic Zeroes’ in the grassroots and
the contrived — albeit expected — ethereal,
relaxed sound that parallels the subtle opti-
mism of Fa1conber1y’s music. This peaceful,
lulling sound, however, when fused with the
unﬂinching lyrics of traditional folk songs,
makes for a unique allegory. Falconberry
intends to tell a story, to celebrate youth,
indulge nostalgia and act sentimental about
music and events, all of which are part of the
album’s charm. I

am announcing play—by—play or color commen-
tary. My motivation allows me to work hard in
both positions and understand the necessary
preparation.

Preparation

Once you get your game assignment, the
preparation begins. You will need to familiar~
-ize yourself with the rosters of both teams set
to play. Even though this is technically called
studying, I would rather review team rosters
than study for exams. Until you actually do it,
you’ll never realize the level of preparation that

professional broadcasters have to put in fora V

successful broadcast. , ‘

In addition to the rosters, you need to look
over the statistics for both teams and be com-
fortable with how each team. operates. It sounds
like tedious work, but sports junkies can do this
all day. And there is nothing betterthan listening
to the broadcast afterward, knowing that your
preparation really paid off because it made the
broadcast a success.

Entertainment .

After the preparation is complete, it is time
to enjoy the game—day experience. Student
broadcasters receive the same treatment as
professional media. We get to interview Pitt
players and coaches as part of the post—game
proceedings, and during the game, we are up in
the press boxworkingwith the professionals. It
is an invaluable experience that never gets old.

Broadcasting these games -is probably the
most fun I have had as a Pitt student. And in
the end, that’s all that matters. Some student
broadcasters want to pursue sports media as
a profession, but the majority of us just do it
because it is fun, and we love it. I

FOOTBALL _
After closesloss, Pitt looks goreboun 

Panthers — the first confergnge Q i I
opponent his team will face this 4

Tyler Pecyna
For The Pitt News

'5-

The football team will have
fewer morning hours than usual

to reﬂect on last week’s loss to
Syracuse when it faces the No.

18 team in the country at 11 a.m.
_ on Saturday.

Coach Paul Chryst said he is
unfazed by the early start and
knows he has an arduous task»
ahead of him.

“We’ve gotone of the top 20
teams in.‘!th._.e country coming

*in, and thatiégwho we get to go
against,” he said. “We’re pretty
fortunate that_way.”

A Pitt (2-3, 0.-i2-Big East) enters
the matchup riding a four—game
winning streak against the Car-
dinals (5-0, 0-0), including last
season’s 21-14 Panther victory
at Papa John’s Cardinal Stadium
that prevented a°Bowl Champion-
ship Series berth for Louisville.
The Panthers own a 4-3 advan-
tage over the Cards in the all—time

‘ ‘Big East series.

Cardinals coach Charlie
Strong said he realized the level
of dominance exhibited by the

  SPORTS

season — over the past four years
and stressed the importance of

taking the season slowly and se-

riously. _

“We’ve had one week off, and
now we start the real season 
I call it the real season because
it is the conference season. And
everything from here out counts.
We’re going to make it a one-
game season,” Strong said in a
press conference. “We have to

make sure we don’t slip. It’s our

first conference game, and it’s
on the road. Solwe’1l need to go
play well.”

In order for Pitt to hand Louis-
ville its first loss of the 2012 cam-
paign, it will need an offense that
averages 31 points per game‘. The
defense has been stingy as of late,
surrendering only two offensive
touchdowns and two field goals
against the past three opponents.
Most importantly, the Panther
defense has limited opponents’
ground attacks in the team’s two
victories, holding Virginia Tech

BASKETBALL

Midnight Madness event will start Pitt’s basketball season

Pat McAteer
Senior Staﬁ‘ Wrz'ter

For everyone involved or inter-
ested in Pitt basketball, last year
marked a season they’d rather
put behind them. ‘

Both the men’s and the wom— 4
6 " en’s teams struggled, compil-

ing records of 22-17 and 8-21,
respectively.

But according to members of
Pitt’s athletic department, the
beginning of the 2012-2013 sea-

Q/yson will be one people will never

want to forget.

On Friday evening at 10 p.m.,
the Pitt basketball program will
celebrate the University’s 225th
anniversary and the beginning
of basketball season with an out-

""‘door practice on Bigelow Bou-

levard in front of the Cathedral
of Learning. The event will fol-
low the evening’s homecoming
festivities at the Cathedral and

Head ‘coach Jamie Dixon and the Panthers offiially begin practice
on Friday. Bobby Mizia | Senior Staff Photographer

will be free for Pitt students and
alumni.

It appears Pitt students and
alumni aren’t the only ones cap-
tivated by the originality of the
event. ‘

Greg Hotchkiss, the school’s

director of media relations for.

men’s basketball and women’s
soccer, said ESPN will live
broadcast the event, which takes
place on the day NCAA basket-
ball teams start practice across
the country. i .

“ESPN announced they’re
broadcasting the game on
ESPN3,” Hotchkiss said. “They’ll
have live updates from the Ca-
thedral of Learning.”

To Hotchkiss’s knowledge,
Pitt’s outdoor Midnight Mad-
ness event is the ﬁrst of its kind

among NCAA basketball teams.

He added that in the case of in-
clement weather, the event will
be moved to the Petersen Events

Center. t

For members of the Oakland
Zoo, Friday night is a chance to
generate enthusiasm for fresh-
men and fans who became disil-
lusioned by the teams’ struggles
last season.

J;D. Schroeder, vice president

‘ of student cheering section the
-Oakland Zoo and manager of

the group’s Twitter account,
said “there’s a huge amount of
interest” for the event. He also
said he and the other Oakland
Zoo leaders are continuing to
plan ways to get students excited
about the upcoming season.

“I think a lot of people want
to forget last season, to be hon-
est. And I think the players think
that way too,” Schroeder said.
“I think, in general, it will help
generate interest.”

Pitt in the NFL: Fitzgerald
finds success in loss

Larry Fitzgerald has continued his reign as ?itt’s best current NFL'player. MCT Campus

Sean Corrado
_ - Stqff Writer

Many former Panthers put up valiant perfor-
mances in Weeks, but their efforts didn’t often

translate to victory for their teams.

Here’s how some of the most notable Pitt
alums fared in their professional games over
the weekend. '

Arizona Cardinal Larry Fitzgerald (Pitt

1 2002-2003) was targeted on 15 of quarterback

Kevin Kolb’s 50 throws against the Rams on
Sunday. . Fitzgerald hauled in eight of those
passes for a tearn—high 92 yards. The entire
Cardinal offense was held out

of the end zone though, as St. Louis took
the game 17-3.

With Arizona’s two top running backs on
injured reserve, the team’s running game has
been nonexistent, meaning Fitzgerald has seen
more of the ball lately. The number of injuries, at
this position also presents a huge opportunity
for fonner Pitt running back LaRod Stephens-
Howling._

Stephens—How1ing (Pitt 2006-2008), who
usually returns kicks for Arizona, is the only

~ back left with experience. He is expected to be

the lead back next week against Buffalo, despite
a nagging hip injury of his own. Howling rushed
for 93 yards on 21 carries when he started the
ﬁnal game of last season, so he is predicted to
garner the majority of touches.

LeSean McCoy (Pitt 2007-2008) of the
Philadelphia Eagles, who” overtook Stephens-
Howling in 2007 as the starting running back
at Pitt, rushed for 56 yards on 16 carries and
tacked on another 27 yards and a touchdown
through the air against the

Steelers. But the Eagles experienced "tum-
over issues that came back' to haunt them, as
they have all year, and the Steelers hit a last-
second ﬁeld goal to take the game 16-14.

McC0y_couldn’t eclipse 70 yards on the
ground for the first time this season, yet he
seems to have a favorable matchup next week
against the Detroit Lion’s run defense. He

yards. Include Pitt’s nail-biter against
Syracuse, and the average rush yards al-
lowed by the Panthers is still only 70.3 in
competitive games. .

But the Cardinals offense will provide
a challenge for even a successful defense.

“They’ve got two running backs [with]

almost identical num-
bers,” said Chryst, re-

mage Sunday at 2
p.m. I

The Cardinals rushing game is certainly
crucial when defending the offense, but
Chryst also commended Louisville’s over-
all stability, including the team’s excep-
tionally accurate thrower under center. ,

“I think they’re certainly balanced on
offense,” he said. “I think [Teddy] Bridge-
water is a heck of a quarterback.”

of his throws this season and has made
use of an accurate arm to the tune of a

jumping out to a 14-0 lead against the defend-

New York, which would eventually take control
of the game and win 41-27.

Andy Lee (Pitt 2000-2004) was the sole
Pitt alum toﬁnd victory in Weeks when his San
