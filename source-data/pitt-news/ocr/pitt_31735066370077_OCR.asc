Panel Promotes Unity, .

Emphasizes Brotherhood

By DIANHE LEFKOWITZ

While the predominantly white
fraternities and sororities find that
they sometimes have trouble“pro-
moting the ideals of “brotherhood”

’ and "sisterhood," black Greeks are

in a double bind.

While the organizations such as
these encourage brother and sister-
hood within their organizations,
“brotherhood” itself is an ideal for

' allblacks.

This was one of the problems dis-
cussed last night by active members
and alumni from the various black
sororities and fraternities at a panel
sponsored by the Black Action
Society (BAS) as part of Black
Week. ,

“We-blackstudents have gone off

M on our separate organizations,” said

BAS president Daryl Davis, who’

mediated the discussion. “I think
[Greeks] feel they’re members of

that organization alone. Regardless’ _ I

of the color T-shirt you wear, you'll

always be a black man or a black '

woman.“ - ’
Panelist Donovan Young, a
memberof Omega Psi P_hi frater-
nity, said black students should
become more involved in school-

and black community-oriented "L

activities. ..
“A lot of times, people get into

so-called cliques,” he said. “[They] M i
say they would llkc to operate out or ' '
that particular clique alone‘. We ’

need to, get these black fraternities‘. 

and sororities organized.” ~

This could be a problem, consid-r— _- 

ering that the panel drew an

Ture   Emphasizes   Organization

“Organization is the weapon of

the oppressed" was the message deli-
vered Tuesday by black activist
Kwame Ture — formerly known as
Stokely Carmichael.

‘ Ture repeated the 1960s’ expres-
sion “If you’re not part of the solu-
tion, you’re part of the problem” in
urging blacks to "organize andjoin in
changing the current political sys-
tem through revolution. ‘

Ture is the name recently adopted
by Carmichael, former chairman of
the Student Non-Violent Coordi-
nating Committee and minister in
the Black Panther Party.

After joining the Panthers in
1968, Ture exhorted blacks to gain
political and economic control.-
throughviolence, if necessary —— of
their own communities.

Speaking at the William Pitt
Union yesterday, Ture encouraged
his mostly black audience to be
proud of their heritage and their
homeland just as Irish Americans,
Slavic Americans or any other
immigrants would be.

Ten Yugoslavian administrators
visited Pitt on Tuesday seeking
advice on how to better organize
Yugoslavian universities.

Their stated purposes were to
learn about the administration of
American universities and to
increase ties between American and
Yugoslavian universities in the areas
of research and instruction. In
July of 1983, Chancellor Wesley
Posvar signed an agreement with
one of the administrators, Professor

.1

“Why are European Americans

allowed to love their homelands, but
blacks aren’t allowed to love
Africa?” Ture asked. “As slaves, we
came here in chains and left a better
world _to live in hell, and we still live
in hell.”

Ture said blacks aren’t proud of
themselves because they suffer from
oppression. Ture called-on all people
to reject this oppression, whether it
appears in politics or economics.

on Education, included,

“All people instinctively love jus- '

tice" and will struggle to preserve it,
“like the serfs against the lords,
slaves against their masters and
workers against capitalism,” Ture

said.

He said that all religions instruct
men to fight for love and equality.
He claims that Africa is the birth-
place of the world’s major religions
-— Judaism, Christianity and Islam.

Because he’s an African, Ture said

he must respect all faiths. “Because .
Judaism began in Africa [Ethiopia], ,

I must always guard and protect it.
Therefore, I must always oppose
Zionism.”

' Ture also said he supports Chris-
tianity, but he criticizes most Chris-
tians. He said 90 percent of
professed Christians have never read
the Bible.

According to Ture, “Africa must
be free," and-in order for this to
happen, it must be socialist. Ture
said that true Jews, Christians and
Muslims.must be socialists because
capitalism is unjust.

Its Quality

By CHERYL B. WILLIAMS

A national rating survey. of
philosophy research-doctorate
programs has recognized Pitt’s
philosophy department for its
scholarly quality of faculty.

The survey, conducted by the
National Research Council,
ranked Pitt’s department second
in the country among the philos-

schools. The department ranked
behind Princeton University.

“I don’t think that these rating
games are all that significant. By
work and luck, we've been able
to create a good department,”
said Dr. Nicholas Rescher, a phi-
losophy professor and director
of-the Center for the Philosophy
of Science. _

In addition to the scholarly
quality of faculty, other criteria

tiveness of the program in edu-
cating research scholars,
improvement in program quality
within the last five years, percen-
tage of graduates with national
fellowships and the size of the
libraries.
Pitt’s history and philosophy
V of science department was also
ranked in the top five.
Some of the philosophy
faculty members hold positions
in both the philosophy depart- -
ment and the history and philos-.
ophy of science department,
though, the two departments are
separate. A
The philosophy department
has “strong-minded, intelligent
A people with different views,”
according to Rescher. He added
that the cohesiveness of the
department also contributed to
the program’s success.
Rescher, who came to Pitt in
1961, is among the _faculty

members who helped to build the

Philosophy Rates Second  

ophy departments at 77 other ’

used in the rating included: effec- ‘

I and- articles and serving as presi-

Stands Out

department. In addition to
teaching philosophy, he wrote
more than 40, books on various,
philosophical topics.

Rescher founded the. Amen'- . .

can Philosophical Quarterly in
19.64 in response to former chan-
cellor Edward Litchfield’s
encouragement to increase the
number of university publica-
tions Rescher said, “At that
point, the field was expanding
and therewas a need for more
scholarly journals in the field.”
Adolf Grunbaum, a philoso-
phyprofessor and chairman of
the Center for Philosophy of
I Science, said he is proud of help-
ing to build the reputation of ‘
Pitt’s philosophy department. ‘

“We [faculty] started from
scratch and have built one of the
foremost departments and cen-
ters,” Grunbaum said.

Grunbaum joined the univer-
sity in I960 and, in the same year,
established the Center for Phi-‘ _
losophy of Science. The center,
which fosters research in philos-
ophy, sponsors activities to bring
people with the same research ‘A
interests together. It also spon-
sors public lectures, seminars
and workshops.

In‘ a soon-to—be-published
book, “Physics, Philosophy and
Psychoanalysis: Essays in Honor
of Adolf Grunbaum,” Grun- 
baum is referred to as a “leading _
philosopher of space and time "
and of the logical.foundation_s of ‘
psychoanalytic theory in the
English-speaking world."

His other accomplishments
include writing several books

dent of ' the Philosophy of
Science Association (1965-70)
and vice-president of the Ameri-
can Assocation for the Advance-
ment of Science (1963). He is
currently president of the Ameri-

-I Davis Warns Of Propaganda

By PEGGY FERRI

Pittsburgh Man Meeting
Honored  

In August of 1970, Davis was
involved in a hostage attempt meant
to free the remaining Soledad Broth-
ers. Guns used in the attempt were
registered in her name. "

Americans should not let them-
selves be misled by anti-Communist
propaganda, according to Angela
Davis, activist, professor and
member of the Communist party.

“I was shocked to discover that I
was on the FBI’s 10 Most Wanted
List,” she said. “I was especially dis-
turbed that people like [Richard]
Nixon and Ronald Reagan weren’t
on the list...they should have been
on that list.”

The American Recorder
Society, Pittsburgh Chapter, will
hold its monthly meeting on
Sunday, Nov. 20, at 7 p.m. at the’
University of Pittsburgh music
building,’ Fifth and Bellefield.

A Pittsburgh man who has
participated for 17 years in
humanitarian expeditions to dis-
advantaged countries has been

Davis spoke Wednesday as part of
Pitt’s l4th annual Black Week,
sponsored by the Black Action
Society.

 

Davis called government reasons
given for the recent invasion of
Grenada “propaganda.” Davis
visited Grenada twice and shared
her impressions of Grenada after the

revolution.

At the time of the revolution,
Grenada was living under the dicta-

V torship of Eric Gairy, which had

close ties to the United States, Davis
said. Unemployment was high on
the island, and there was no public
education.

During the revolution (in I979),
she said Gairy was speaking before
the United Nations about unidenti-
fied ﬂying objects. “They were more
important to him than the welfare of
his own people,” she said.

After Maurice Bishop came into
power as prime minister, Davis said,
Grenada had public transportation
for the first time, and the people
took an active interest in their
government.

Davis is not new to political acti-
vism. She recalled her involvement
in the “movement against racism
and for black liberation.” V \

“There are lessons to be learned
from those struggles," she told the
audience. “We demonstrated to

have his way if the people organized

and fought back.”

Davis was referring to an incident
that led to her removal from the
position of philosophy professor for
being an active member of the Com-
munist party in the late ’60s.

Davis had allegedly given inﬂam-
matory speeches outside of the class-
room in defense of the Soledad
Brothers, prisoners in the Soledad
in Soledad, Calif. One
brother was George Jackson, who
was serving a one year to life sent-
ence for robbing a service station,
she said. He was later shot by guards
during an attempted prison break.

 

She said the district attorney
wanted the death penalty for her
three times —- one death for each

. capital crime.

A movement sprang up to free
Davis that spread to other countries.
“There were 250 committees set up

to work in my defense," she said.

Davis was eventually acquitted. 4

She stressed the importance of
organizing and said it was that
organizing that played a part in her
case and will play a part in the
future. ' I

“Installing democracy in Gren-
ada,” she said, “the audacity of it.
How can you install democracy in
Grenada when we don't even have
democracy at home.”

She said itiis everyone’s responsi- F
bility to join a campaign and become
involved in that campaign.

“As long as Reagan is in power,
there is going to continue to be
racism,” she said. “We should dump
him in 1984.”

  Too Adventurous

Inithe aftermath of the U.S. invasion of Gren-
ada, some key points have gotten lost in the
milieu.

Grenada has been a bone in President Reagan’s
craw for some three years, and as recently as last
March, he deplored that country for building an
airport. It was the construction of this new air-
port which provided one of the original justifica-
tions for invading Grenada. Nevermind that the
airport was designed by a British construction
firm or that a British planning ministry recom-
mended its construction back in 1955, it was
being built by Cubans, and that is enough in

‘Reagan’s opinion.

The invasion was supposedly provoked by the
chaos which existed in Grenada following the
execution of Maurice Bishop. It is ironic to say
the least that the United States should intervene
in a communist country because its Marxist
leader has been deposed. It is also contrary to the
doctrine of non-intervention as stated in the Rio
Treaty which the United States has signed. But
nevermind international law, American lives
were in jeopardy. It is still not clear, however,
who was threatening them — Cubans, Grenadi-
ans or the U.S. Rangers.

_ Granted that Grenada was building an airport,
it cannot be considered threatening as a military
outpost; The airport was non-military in design.
It has no ‘provision for anti-aircraft guns —
standard fare on military airports around the
world. There is no underground storage facilities
for gasoline,,no place to keep the MIG’s which

I were supposed to land there. It is questionable

whether or not a MIG loaded with weapons could
land there at all.

What about the Cubans? Does just the pres-
ence of Cubans in a country mean subversion and
revolution? If this is the case, then perhaps the
U.S. should intervene everywhere that it finds
Cubans. But no one would agree to this — this is
crazy. — A

The point is that intervention in small Carib-

bean countries, or South-American countries or
African countries is ill-advised if it is based on the
presence of Cubans or airports. Maurice Bishop
was immensely popular with his people. If the
U.S. had chosen to intervene before he was killed,
the reaction in Grenada may have been quite
different than the warm welcome we seem to have
received. ‘

. It is also unfortunate that the U.S. chose to
intervene in Grenada and met with such success
for success tempts adventure — in small coun-
tries, of course. We should be concerned that one
day we may find that we have intervened where
the natives are not so friendly. ‘

Trying To Understand Fea ‘

By PEGGY FERRI

“What do you think you want to
study at the university?” I asked
Axel. _ A

“I don't know. Maybe there won't
be time —— I mean, we may not be
here tomorrow,” he said.

During my study abroad in West
Germany last summer, I met many
students like_ Axel who had thesame
fears — fears I could not then and do
not now fully understand. They were
more actively concerned about
tomorrow than students here are,
and they spent hours in their student
pubs talking about politics and to-
morrow. Conversations would occa-
sionally grow quiet every now and
then, and although my German
wasn’t the best, I knew why.

The students, however, weren’t
always so serious; no one could
remain so intense. They listened a lot
to American rock-n-roll and made
valiant attempts now and then to
sing along, but always conversation
could turn without notice to the
Pershing lls and cruise missiles due
to be deployed in West Germany in
December.

Americans generally try to keep
from thinking aboutiwhat is really
being said when the possiblity of a
limited nuclear war is discussed —
another extreme entirely, compared
to other Western European coun-
tries like Germany. The U.S.
government tries to insure our secur-
ity, but we never stop to consider if
the government’s efforts don't actu-
ally produce further insecurity.

On Sunday evening, ABC televi-
sion is airing a movie called “The
Day After,” about a family and how
it is devastated by nuclear war. The
great irony is that now many
“experts” are warning about the
harmful effects of seeing this film. In
other words, it isn’t harmful to listen
to officials trivialize phrases like
“limited nuclear war” or read inter-
views with military personnel and
others who welcome America’s new

‘We are, instead,
encouraged to
consider such con-
cepts and eventu-
ally accept them.’

show of strength in the world arena.
We are, instead, encouraged to con-
sider such concepts and eventually
accept ‘them.

But this film is supposedly a dif-

ferent matter, and some psycholo-

gists interviewed in The New York
Tinies,(Nov. 7), are advocating that
children not see the ﬁlm.

“The sense of loss suffered’ by the
families on the screen may provoke
profound fears about children’s sep-
aration from parents,” said Dr.
Dorothy Singer, a psychologist who
has studied the effects of television

on young viewers. “I fear children
will have nightmares about the show
and worry about it for weeks or even
months. Older children and adults

may have a sense of hopelessness."

v But that is why people should see
the movie. So many professionals
are concerned that when Americans
see the graphic details, they will find
it too upsetting, but few are con-
cerned about what we can read.

In addition to all the books and
interviews is Dr. Carl Sagan's'recent
report on the possible effects of a
nuclear war. Sagan is a scientist and
astronomer who teaches at Cornell
University. He has written that the
explosion of a few hundred meg-
atons would do great damage to the
atmosphere. The soot and debris, he
predicts, would be thick enough to
blot out the sun for several months
and decrease temperatures to well
below zero. '

ABC is planning a forum discus-
sion after the movie to elaborate on
the film and highlight the finer
points of what is meant by or possi-
ble in a nuclear confrontation. '

Mr. Rogers has also devoted a
show to children’s fears and nuclear
war. It’s getting to be so the children
think more about it than the adults
do; many have said we should listen
to the children.‘

I still can’t fully comprehend the
fear or the attitudes of the German
students with whom I spent my
summer. Perhaps after I see “The
Day After,” I'll be better able to
appreciate them.

I-las a Student Government
Board election finally concluded
the way it’s supposed to?

Ken Stram worked hard for
endorsements and earned a large
portion of them. Unlike Greg
Petro, who relied on persuasive
rhetoric to fool the endorsers,
Ken knew what to say because he
was aware of the happenings of
the current board. Lon didn’t
have to worry about endorse-
ments; he had a political machine
backing him.

All of the candidates cam-
paigned hard. “Lon Santis" pos-
ters were in every classroom
possible. “Greg Petro” posters
came in a close second. “Ken
Strain” posters — what’s a Ken

Stram poster? As far as the board

goes, they seemed to abide by the I
campaign poster rules.

Greg really knocked the cur-
rent board. It was a good politi-

' cal tactic considering Ken is on

the board along with three of
Lon’s fraternity brothers. Too
bad he didn’t have a clue. Mark
Downs explained that the Sen.
Hart incident didn’t even reach
the board; Greg still insisted that
it was the hardest decision the
board had to make. '

Ken:

Dear Editor:

In response to Coach Joe
Paterno’s quote featured in the
Wednesday, Nov. 9, I983, Post
Gazette, we, as two University of
Pittsburgh students, have this to
say:

How could Coach Paterno
describe the game as a “fluke,”
especially with regard to statisti-
cal performance comparisons of
the two teams? This comment
was bigotted, unprofessional and
completely unfounded consider-
ing the final score.

Coach Paterno has, in the
past, always been impressive as a

coach, especially in light of press
comments and releases. This
quote, however, serves to but-
tress the existing rivalry between
the two universities, not to quell
it. Being two intelligent, mature,
young adults, we believe this has
served to lower our opinion of

sedate, level-headed and rational ‘

Paterno’s Criticism Unfair

not only Paterno’s professional-
ism but also that ofthe university
his team represents.

Our intention, please realize, is
not one of belittlement or blatant
hostility; however, our main pur-
pose is to bring forth a realiza-
tion of past successes and failures
of both teams and the contrast in
media publicity to them. Con-
sider Pitt's history of nine
National Championships com-
pared to Penn State's recent, fee-
ble one —— in how many years.

How dare Mr. Paterno con-
sider the Pitt vs. Notre Dame
game a “fluke” when not only
was it a well-executed and physi-
cal game but also one in which
the penalties called were fair and
legitimate, not strictly for the
benefit of the home team.
(Sound familiar: Nebraska vs.
Penn State, I982, and/or Ala-
bama vs. Penn State, 1983.)

The Pitt News, Friday, November ll,‘ I983.

Generation Labelled Unfairly

Dear Editor:

I take great umbrage at the recent
editorial entitled “Events in
Lebanon Confusing,” written by
Diane Lefkowitz, which appeared in
the Nov. 4 issue of The Pitt News.

Miss Lefkowitz stated, “I am of
the generation where peace is virtu-
ally unknown to the Israelis, where I
have not experienced anti-Semitism
in any form during my life, where
getting a job and getting ahead are
more important than the abstract
ideals of Zionism.” . ,

This is quite ironic. I am also a
senior at the University of Pitts-
burgh, which I believe places me in
her generation. However, her opin-
ions are quite diametrical to my
own. I have experienced L anti-
Semitism since grade school, and
“the abstract ideals of Zionism” cer-
tainly mean more to me than two
cars in my garage and a house in the
suburbs».

I feel a sense of pity for Miss Lef-
kowitz, who seems to be at a loss for
her identity. She wrote, “I cannot
identify with my grandmother, who
came from Hungary and lived dur-

ing the Holocaust period, nor can I ,

identify with my parents’ undying
and unlimited loyalty to Israel, so
many thousands of miles away.”

My grandparents also came from
Eastern Europe to flee the Holo-
caust, and coincidentally, my par-
ents also support Israel. Thereiis one
difference. I do identify myself both
as a Jew and a Zionist. Rather than
deny and ignore my heritage, I have
chosen to live my life as a Jew and an
American.

I find it unfair that Miss Lefko-
witz has labelled her generation, my
generation, as a group ofyoung peo-

 
  

ple concerned solely with “our
classes and grades and boyfriends
and jobs."

Perhaps because I chose not to
forget the Holocaust, though I did
not live through it either, I am aware
of the importance of Israel as a
country -— a Jewish country.

Like Miss Lefkowitz, I also have
been terribly upset about the recent
deaths of the American Marines in
Lebanon, but I do not place the
blame on Israel. She wrote, “For a
young Jew in America I983, they’ve
[the past two weeks] been two weeks
of confusion and inner conﬂict.” If
Miss Lefkowitz were aware of Mr.

Reagan’s policy for sending the
Marines into Lebanon, perhaps
some of her tension and anxiety
would subside.

Under our constitutional guaran-
tee of freedom of speech and the
press, Miss Lefkowitz is free to write
whatever she pleases, but I find it
unprofessional and disturbing that
she attempted to link the grave issue
of our Marines in Lebanon, which
has national and international rami-
fications, with her own personal
identity crisis as a Jew.

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — Derek C. Bok, president of Harvard
University has publicly announced his opposition to a referendum
that would ban nuclear-arms productionvin Cambridge, Mass.

According to The Chronicle of Higher Education, Bok said that
while Harvard is not engaged in arms production, it is a dangerous
precedent for local communities to forbid research they feel is
undesirable. _ .. , .

NEW HAVEN, Conn. — Yale medical school has enforced its
security measures and purchased some new equipment after three
hampsters injected with a deadly strain of virus disappeared recently
from a research lab.

New cages have been installed after damage to the cages from
sterilization was discovered. According to The Chronicle of Higher
Education, medical school officials have speculated that the hamsters
were thrown out in the trash which is sterilized and then burned.

STATE COLLEGE, Penn. —— A noise ordinance has been drafted
by the borough in which Penn State lies that would limit the amount
of noise during certain times of the day and in different areas.

The new ordinance is more ﬂexible than the current one. It allows

\ noise levels to go above 55 decibels in residential districts and 65 in
commercial districts. Times of day also influence the noise level. For
example, in most residential districts, the level changes to 55 decibels
at ll p.m.

The new law designates a portion of the town as a fraternity district
and will make the new noise level 50 decibles at ll:30 p.m. The
interfraternity council at Penn State is objecting to this on the grounds
that this is the time when fraternities make the most noise and_receive

the most citations, which will only make the situation worse. . . . Lita photo  7'

At the time Bell pledged at Boston
University, the school was a very
segregated one; black students prim-
arily stuck together, which is why
Greek organizations were
important.

 
 
    

“The only support system wehad
was other black students.” he said.

 
    

Delta Sigma Theta alumna Vele-
ter Mazyck, a Pittsburgh attorney,
agreed that the small number of
black students was a binding factor
among blacks in all the fraternities
and sororities- When she went to
Carnegie-Mellon University in the
late 1960s and early 705, only about
60 or 70 of the 5,000 students were
black.

“[Greek life] was a way of getting

them together," she said. “It didn’t
matter what sorority you were in.
Everyone had a bond. You don't just
belong to an organization, you
belong to a sisterhood or brother-
hood. That’s something far above

and beyond that organization.

“You know you share a lot of

Bell said much of the problem lies

with the incoporation of the white-
oriented definition of manhood into
the rituals and pledging of black
fraternities.

“If you define me as a man or—a
woman using that kind of ritual...
you’re gonna keep on being white-
oriented,” he said. “As long as the
white value system remains in our
rituals and our pledging, how are we
going to be unified?” ‘

One particular tradition that must
go in order for progress, he said, is
that of hazing during the pledge
period. Davis listed the Interfrater-
nity Council’s restrictions on hazing
and asked if the black fraternities
abided by the same rules.

“In these times of anguish, when
the black race is slowing sinking
toward genocide," Davis said, “we
don’t need to be hurting each other."

Young defended the pledge D70.-

cess by comparing it to the indoctri-‘ ‘

nation of Marines and said going

through. that period together draws . H 

pledge brothers closer.

“When you join the Marines," he
said, “you have a drill instructor
who is always on your case. He puts

- you under physical stress, and you’re
tired because of that stress. That ».

decreases your mental ability to
resist. » ,

fraternities isthe same_sort of thing.

Although those methods may
have been fine for his time, Bell said
they are not realistic for I983.

“If the definition of manhood
means that black is beautiful, it is

contradictory ‘for black brothers to ‘ 7

said. “That doesn’t tell [people] that

Line/it     

Death Knocks

By IONATI-IAN KUNKEL .

”Chaos.” This word, used by one of
the characters in the Studio Theatre
production of Line, written by Israel
Horovitz, exemplifies the show well.
What other word could be used when
all of the actors, by the end of the
play, push, shove, hit and almost kill
each other? -

Line is a most difficult play to
decipher, but under all of the ”chaos,”
there is bound to be some underlined
meaning to the play.

What playwright Horovitz seems
to be saying is that people are basi-

. Cally bad, manipulative and uncaring.

All of the characters in Line are writ-
ten in a negative way. Even the so-
called ”hero" of the show is portrayed
as being a little crazy, and he's defi-
nitely not a nice person.

Line begins with a scene showing
Fleming, tired from waiting in a ticket
line, sleeping on the floor. He is easily
an easily manipulated simpleton who
has been in line all night. Steven, the
so-called hero of the show, enters and
proceeds to out—smart Dolan of his
first-place position.-The other three

characters then’ find their way to the "i

/ .

line. The seductive . Molly, her
unlikely husband Arnall and the quiet
but smart Dolan vie with Fleming and
Steven to become first in line.
Steven, the smartest and the most
manipulative of the five, can usually
be found at the head of the queue
during most of the hour and 10 min-
ute act. V _ s "
Horovitz puts_ his characters
through a series of situations, most
of which are headed by "Steven. His

characterization of Steven is most»

interesting. Steven, who seems to be
the most stable and the smartest of
the five, ends up being the most
unstable of the five.

The_-acting in the show was defi-
nitely top—notch. It was apparent that
the cast practiced day and night on
the show. At thetop of the heap was
David Leite as Steven. His portrayal
of the manipulative crazy was fasci-
nating to watch.

Director Kenyon L. Barr's staging
was very good, considering he had to
have people stand in a straight line
and make them visible to a theater-
in-the-round audience.

Death Knocks, the second one-act of
the evening, written by Woody Allen,
didn't work. The main reason was
that Line left the audience with such a
weird mood, that it was impossible to
fully enjoy this short one act play that

i followed. Whoever made the decision _ .

to! have ‘Line firstainot only made" a

grave error but also wasted the tal-

ents of all involved with Death Knocks. _

Another reason Death Knocks didn't
work is that the humor used by the
actors was notlWoody Allen's humor
— a bad thing to doin a play written

by Woody Allen. His tongue-in-cheek

humor is unique and -should be’ per-
formed as he intended ‘it to be per-

formed — not by using the cheap

gags employed in this production.
The two plays are at opposite ends

— of the spectrum and definitely «pro-

vided the audience with a sampling of
two different kinds of theater.

The Wiz

BY LISA LAVAILE

The Wiz, the hit broadway musical
that was the winner of seven Tony
Awards, including the Best Musical,
opened last Tuesday night for eight
performances at the Stanley Theatre.

Two-time Tony Award winner
Geoffrey Holder is once again the
director and costume designer while
George Faison recreates his energetic

— choreography numbers.

Stephanie Mills created the role of
Dorothy in the original Broadway
production at the age of 16, and the
Brooklyn—born singer/actress was
soon‘ catapulted to fame onthat "yel-
low brick road.” Now she. is back on

tour, a bit older at 26: yet she is still a ’

natural as Dorothy. How is it that the 

tiny, 4-9 Stephanie can have such a
big voice? Upon opening night, her

 

 

voice seemed to be welling up from- — I
deep inside, enthralling the entire 

audience.

This production of The Wiz is not a  l 

showcase for actors; it's just a snazzy.’

musical with an array_of florid cos-q, 
tumes grandiose effects, lively danc-I _' ‘-

ing and dynamic songs. -. -

Although the razzle-dazzle in_ The»: 
Wiz was appealing, this reviewer-

didn't particularly care for its”

raunchy modernity. For example, the

evil witch rides Dorothy's house like‘ 

she is fulfilling a sexual fantasy; the

flying monkeys are clad in nothing

but G—Strings and wings; the Lion is a

‘ modern-day stud whom the poppies
try to seduce and Glinda the Good .
Witch comes across like a Playboy)

Playmate.

The supporting cast is overflowing
with talent. Gregg Baker is sensa-
tional as the Cowardly Lion, portray-

ing him with lustiness and vanity.‘_
Ella Mitchell, as the bad witch, is_a

delightful monstrosity of evil, and _ 

Ann Duquesnay and John-Anng

Washington are a good time as the

good witches (but not too good), 

Addaperle and Glinda.

The Wiz is_ more than satisfying
enough for you to make an effort to -
see a performance. It is an appealing V p
~burst~of sounds,--sights and energy. 

 

The sign at the Decade on _October
26 announced the evening's sche-

duled appearance of the Cobras -— *

the Texas rhythm and blues band
that spawned guitarist Stevie Ray
Vaughan — with the added attraction
of ”a veryspecial guest.” And since
Vaughan was opening that very
evening for the Moody Blues at the
Civic Arena, there was speculation

" _ that he might be_”the very special
‘r . guest,” perhaps stopping by the club

after his set to see his old band.

_ At 10 o'clock, the appearance of the
trademark wide-brimmed black hat
in the window of the club's front door
created quite a buzz. Exclamations
could be heard travelling across'the
room, "He's here, he's here!” Stevie
Ray Vaughan, rock's newest guitar
sensation, dressed in a brown leather
jacket, khaki leather pants and cow-
boy boots, strolled over to the bar and

.got a drink. After he greeted some

familiar faces, he went over to the
stage where he spent time talking it
up with the members of his old band,
the Cobras, as they set up for their
show.

After Vaughan sat back and tho-
roughly enjoyed the Cobras’ first set,
the lead vocalist called him onstage.
He picked up a guitar and joined the
band for renditions of two R&B clas-
sics, "Shake It All Night” and "Did
You Miss Me?" with Vaughan doing
extensive soloing to the crowd's ela-
tion. But the highlight of the set was
a crackling version of Iimi Hendrix's
"Red House," where Vaughan’s solos
had the audience going crazy and
raising comments to the effect that
Vaughan is ”just as good as Hendrix.”

I ' ' s1lo'vvca&, Friday, ‘November II. 1983

But backstage, Vaughan later says
that he isn't totally fond of all the
recent comparisons between Hendrix
and himself. "There's only one Iimi
Hendrix and there will never be
another Jimi Hendrix, and I wish peo-

ple would quit trying to make’

another Jimi Hendrix,” Vaughan says
wearily. "When I do his songs or if I
use his style, I figure that if he gave us
that much, then we'd better give
some of it back by continuing to use it
and keep it alive. "The comparison
is a compliment in one way, but in
another way, it hurts because that
means that people have really forgot-
ten so much of what he was doing.
What I'm saying is that if it were
somebody saying that I was trying to
keep something alive that he did
without trying to just make my l_iving
off it, then I'd understand. But a lot of
the media people end up using it for
hype, and to me, that's a drag.... But I
love Iimi Hendrix,” Vaughan says,
with his face lit up like a kid talking
about Superman.

Aside from the hype, though,
Vaughan lists «Hendrix as a major
influence, along with his brother,
jimmy Vaughan (lead guitarist of the
Fabulous Thunderbirds), and a
number of rhythm and blues greats.
"Rhythm and blues to me is the best
kind of music I can think of,” he says.
"To me, it's ‘regular music, and it just
dawned on me recently that that's
not normal in this day and time."

But what really doesn't seem nor-
mal is the fact that this outstanding
guitarist, featured on David Bowie's

(Let's Dance album, didn't play .on the

recent Bowie tour. Rumor said that
the reason Vaughan didn't tour with

Bowie was that he wasn't getting
enough money. But Vaughan says,
"No, I had signed the contract," indi-
cating that this wasn't the case.

So why didn't he do Bowie's tour
after doing the album and the rehear-
sals for the tour? ’_'Mainly, the stick
along there was that he had offered
me the tour with my drummer, my
bass player and me opening all the
shows, and then I would play with his
band later. But when it came time to
do the tour, they [Vaughan’s —band,

°.O

"- nib‘-'

..

Double Trouble] were not included ‘

on any of the shows, and Icouldn't do
interviews, I couldn't do any gigs on
the days off and the days off ended up
disappearing -—- there were no days
off," he says, adding that tour rehear-
sals were rescheduled to conflict with
any Double Trouble engagements so
that he couldn't play with his band;
That was the final
Vaughan.- "Why should I leave these
guys sitting, twiddling their thumbs
when we've got a record that we
believe in, that we're putting out," he

we have a record deal, and I care
about playing with these guys that
are with me doing it." .

Vaughan’s unshaken loyalty to his
band exemplifies his modest, simple
nature. It's typical for him to say that
"I can't walk and chew at the same
time" while he clumsily autographs
copies of his Texas Flood album, and
then to go onstage and play the guitar
with agility, speed and style.

His simplicity also shows in his phi-
losophy of using the guitar: "You've
got to start off listening all the time,
and if you don't listen, you won't ever
learn anything, and- you can't,ever
play anything because you don't ever

do anything. So you gotta listen and
keep trying, period. But don't ever
quit — if you do, then you give up
something you ha_d.—— feelings. You
see a lot—of quitters walking around
like zombies 'cause they sell mobile

homes" now or something. They're '
making money, but they're misera-

ble," he says.

Vaughan's sound is also pure and
simple ("I want the clearest, biggest
tone I can get, that's all," he says.). He
doesn't use a lot of the effects that

Eddie Van Halen and other rock guit- .

arists use to get what Vaughan calls a
"fusion" sound. "I “ use two effects
right now — I don't really like to use
them. The only reason I do is that I
don't have three hands that Ican turn
up my amp and turn it back down
while I'm playing.... Ican punch a but-
ton instead of resetting everything
on my amps 'cause if I reset my amps,
a lot of times I'll go through them real
quick — I'll blow them up and stuff,"
he says with a big toothy grin. "And if
I turn them up, then when I turn
them back down, it doesn't sound as
good as it did before." ’

But Stevie Ray Vaughan doesn't
have to worry about sounding" good
— or much else for that matter. He's
receiving high laurels as one of
today's best guitarists, his Texas Flood
album is currently at No. 64 after 16
weeks on Billboard's Top LPS chart,
and he's happy with his record com-
pany (Epic) and his producer (John
Hammond).

And considering the man's pure
and simple motivation — to play his

music with all that feeling and to play -

it the best that he can — it really
couldn't happen to a nicer guy.

COLOUR BY NUMBERS
Culture Club
Virgin Records

It is certainly a formidable
chore that confronts the non-

vocalist members of England's R

Culture Club: establishing
themselves as something other
than mere background for the
falmboyant sexuality of their
lead singer, Boy George

O’Dowd. Unfortunately for the '
band, their second release,

Colour By Numbers, is no such
breakthrough.

Producer Steve Levine, who
also produced last year's well-

.balanced debut, Kissing To Be

Clever, seems to have sacked the

idea of Culture Club as a band V

here. Instrumentation, it seems,
has been a trade off. Guitarist
Roy Hay has been wiped out
almost completely while
drummer Jon Moss and bassist
Mikey Craig could easily be
replaced on this record by a tal-
ented software specialist.

The really bothersome aspect
of Culture Club's retreat from
musicianship (only the album's
finest moment, "Church of the
Poison Mind,” is fully instru-
mented) is that this is not a band
completely bankrupt of ability.
A variety of influences contrib-
uted to some excellent songs on
Kissing to be Clever; "I'm Afraid of

INTRODUCING, THE STYLE
COUNCIL

The Style Council

Polydor

Great album, old concept.
Introducing The Style Council, the
debut release from Paul Weller’s
latest musical project, is quite
irresistible with its anglo-ized
soul concept and Detroit sound.
-However, anyone who's even
heard of the word Motown will
realize that this‘ music's old-hat
when compared to masters like

. Smokey Robinson and the mah-

velous Marvin Gaye.

Of course, that's no reason
not to listen to this seven-song
mini-LP because Mr. Weller has
always been fascinated with the
‘soul way-of-music, and Introduc-
ing The Style Council is an excellent

Me,” "Time (Clock of the
Heart)" and "White Boys (Can't
Control It)" were all standout
numbers, and each had differ-
ent musical roots.

This time around, however,
Culture Club has left out most

of these influences. With the .

range of musical styles suddenly
restricted, and the energy level
muted, we are left to consider
arrangements that are neces-
sarily sparse. The brooding
piano pieces which appear from

impersonation to say the least.
The EP is a continuation of the
sound with which Weller was
experimenting on The Bitterest
Pill (I Ever Had To Swallow) and

Beat Surrender. It's full of lazy’

basslines, steamy organ work
and a steady Detroit backbeat
that glisten like the chrome on a
'57 T-Bird. Moreover, the
album has a live feel, which
makes for added spontaneity,
especially in songs like "-Head-
start For Happiness” and the
improvisational instrumental
"Mick's Up,” in which Council
keyboardist Mick Talbot (the
only other definite member of
the band) coaxes a nasty groove
out of the ivories.

Weller’s political standing
resurfaces in the decidely anti-
Thatcher "Money—Go—Round,"

are forced to try too hard to
make up for all that is obviously
missing. In short, there is
nothing like pushing the mate-
rial on this album.

‘ While there are ‘songs here
that just aren't very good (the
positively lame "Karma Chame-
leon"v and ridiculous "Storm-
keeper” don't belong on this or
any other album), there are oth-
ers that succeed in spite of the

which combines cynicism,
funky bass and a great anonym-
ous female backing vocal to
become the stand-out cut of the
mini-album. Weller’s genius
also shows on "Long Hot

Summer” and "Speak Like A
Child,” which sneakily borrows
its melody from "The Bitterest

Pill" (OK, it's not original, but

it's a damn good song).

While Introducing The Style
Council borrows heavily from
the Motown soul era, it quickly
re. :ems itself with Weller’s
keen sense of songmanship and
tasteful revival of the style.
Most of all, it's a great album to
listen to. Of course, with his tal-
ent, more originality should be
expected from Paul Weller, but

record's many problems. "Miss
Me Blind" is an engaging piece
of music for instance, as is
”Church of the Poison Mind."
In the end, most of the music

on Colour By Numbers is neither \

good nor bad, it's merely suffer-
ing. It suffers from treatment
and it suffers’ from a lack of
enthusiasm. Mostly, though, it
suffers from Culture Club's not
doing what they've shown they
do best.’ S

Strange, this band doesn't
sound American; it leans more

towards the pseudo-funk of Brit
bands like the Thompson
Twins. Which doesn't mean
they're good (if you like the
Thompson Twins) or bad (if you
hate the Thompson Twins), but
sort of...ummm...in-between.
"Negligible" is a word that
comes to mind.

Some songs, like "Get Off My
Case" and "Cinnamon," are
nearly wonderful; a James
Brown—ish funk beat jumps
along, begging you to go with it.

. Problem is, the sound itself is
‘ just a little too artificial to win

‘Dave Marsh

St...Martins Press

Rock-n-roll literature rarely
achieves greatness now that Lester
Bangs is dead. However, when it
does, there is usually one man

. responsible — Dave Marsh. His docu-

mentation of‘ the Bruce Springsteen
and Elvis Presley legacies caused crit-

s ics to gasp in awe at such remarkable

works of writing. Now, with his
latest tome, Before I Get Old: The Story of
The Who, Marsh scores the hat-trick
with another rock masterpiece.
-Taking into account that the Who
have been around for close to twenty

controversial years and that Dave

Marsh has become one of the most
jaded rock criticlauthors to wield ‘a
pen, this book was no easy feat".
Nevertheless, Marsh h-as turned his
obsession with Pete Townshend,

THE COMPLETE AIR GUITAR
HANDBOOK

By John McKenna and Michael
Moffitt

Long Shadow Books

The Complete Air Guitar Handbook is
quite possibly one of the saddest
excuses ever for cutting down a tree.
‘It exemplifies an unfortunate trend
in much of today's pop media: if

result, we have The Valley Girl Hand-

Before I Get Old begins at the very '
beginning with Townshend’s The
Detours and ends with the ”appar- .

focusing on Townshend and the
insane Keith Moon, as the group
members progress from lower-class
headbangers to rock-n—roll demi-

Throughout, Marsh is honest,
sharp and aggressive. He keeps his

not as a participant, which keeps the

book unfettered of any unnecessary

sympathy for The Who's stormy his-

for attention and the often volatile
relationships among the band
members are carefully explained but
never explained away. Marsh offers
no excuses for ‘the Who — he just

Panthers Must Maintain

Intensity Against Army  

.1

By scorr DELLETT

For the first time since the Louis-
ville game, the Pitt football team has
a breather, a well-deserved rest after
the emotionally-draining victory at
Notre Dame last weekend. Playing
Army is an offense player’s dream -
fatten up the statitics.

' History shows that the Cadets
have little right to playon the same
field’ as the Panthers. The closest

I {Zlargin between the teams in 10

years is 18 points; the average score
during this period is 41-9. The last
time Army won was in this series in
1971. Since then, Pitt has reeled‘off
nirie consective wins.

So when the Panthers run onto
the Pitt Stadium turf at 1:30 p.m.

tommorrow afternoon, the 45,000‘

or so spectators plus scouts from the
Fiesta Bowl can assume Pitt will be

(8-2 without breaking a sweat.

. The Panther players and coaches
refuse to assume anything. '

“Army is coming here thinking,
‘They're going to take us lightly and
not‘ practice hard," ” cornerback
Troy Hill said. “We have a mission
to accomplish — to end the season
with two victories. We’re not going
to lay back.”

“I treat every team the same, I
prepare the same,” safety Ray Wea-
therspoon said. “We all do. We’ll
practice hard, just as hard as for
Notre Dame. -5

Lady Spikers Battle For Local Superiority

 

“The only difference, though,
between the fans, the media and eve-
ryone is that we gotta play the next
one [Army], and they are only look-
ing at the last one [Penn State],”
offensive coordinator Joe Moore
said.

“We’re going to
impress people and
end doubts that Pitt is‘
not playing well.’’
Troy Hill

 —

But this is Army, a 2-7 team that
has lost to such powers as Lehigh,
Colgate and Louisville, the same
team Pitt routed by 48 points. The
Cadets have been outscored 224-
120. The brightest spot is their pun-
ter, Joe Sartiano, who is l2th in the
nation in punting.

Also, Pitt needs to have a big
game to impress bowl scouts. An
offensive explosion of 50-plus points
would do quite nicely. This is a team,
even with a 7-2 record and in the Top
20, still stuggling to gain some
credibility. ‘

“We’re going to impress people
and end doubts that Pitt is not play-
ing well,” Hill said_. “We’re not going
to run [the score] up but win respec-
tably. We\.don’t care if it’s by one or
100 [points]. All that people look at
after the game is the wins and losses.

“We have a chip on our shoulder.
People had us going 4-7 before the
season even started. We never
played a down. That hurt the guys.
We know what we can do —just go
out and play ball. We have a lot to

prove and want to shut up a lot of ’

people who are not for Pitt.”

Army would like to prove it can at
least stay competitive with Pitt. This
year has been rough — even by
Army standards —— for first year
coach Jim Young.

“We’ve been a young football

team, andvsome injuries have been '

hurting us during the season,”

Young said. “We haven’t played as ‘

good football as_we like to, espe-
cially the past two or three games.

“Our problem is offensive,
mainly. We have great physical
strength in that line, but we haven’t
passed the football to a large
extent.” ‘

The Cadets have cut down on the
Divison I-A football teams on the
schedule, sticking to Ivy League and
Division I-AA schools. Still, the
Notre Dames and Pitts remain.

' One does not have to be Sherlock
Holmes to deduce the seriousness of

— the Lady Panther volleyball team’s

bout with Penn State this weekend.

There is no need to dig out the
magnifying glass because Pitt's spik-
ers have confessed to the deed even
before they’ve committed it. Ven-
geance has never been so passion-
ately sought, nor has the
determinationsto right a wrong ever
been so strong as it is now.

On Sept. l7, Penn State defeated
the host of the Pitt Classic in three
games. The Classic was one of five
tournaments Pitt would win despite
the loss, and the Lady Lions finished
the weekend in last place. Although
the match was nearly two months
ago, Lady Panther coach Shelton

A Collier remembers it well.

Collier was forced to take on Pitt’s
arch-foe without the services of his
inexperienced but rapidly improv-
ing setters, to whom he referred as
the quarterbacks of the team. Cap-
tain Judy Young had been wrestling
with an unsteady ankle, and junior
Cathy Rupp had injured her foot
that very morning, leaving the team
in dire straits.

In their stead, Collier placed vocal
sophomore Sally Gillespie,who had
set in high school. But at 5-4, Gilles-

- pic was not a threat at the net, which’

both Young and Rupp are.

“If you’re in a street light, and you
get a broken arm and leg,” Collier
said, “and then you get beat, the next

. time you fight that battle you want

to pay back the party who hit you
when you were down.”

This is the game that was created
as a fun diversion, the less physical
alternative to basketball. How times
have changed. Welcome to power
volleyball, a serious, growing sport,
not the informal get-together at

Schenley Park. /»

The Pitt News-photo=

Pltt cornerback ‘Troy. Hill says the Panthers need to maln-
taln the emotional level shown during the Notre Dame ”

game tomorrow agalnst Army.

’ Pitt has the opportunity and
plenty of motive to knock Penn
State from its lofty position in the
Top 20, but does it have the means?
For starters, the team is healthy, and
"Collier maintains that the two areas
of the game on which his team has
worked extensively in the past sev-

eral weeks will be key factors in .

determining Pitt’s chances of
winning. '

“Penn State ordinarily plays bet-
ter defense,” Collier said. “If we can
,play defense equal to theirs, and if
we’re able to put‘ pressure on them
with aggressive serving, we’ll be in a

‘ position to win.”

The coach pinpointed the middle

blocking position as the site of some

exttemely hard hitting. .

“The winner of the two middle
blocking battles will have a good
shot at winning the match,” Collier
said. V

Lori Barbarich, considered by
many to be the top spiker in the East,
will team "with Marcy Leap at that
vital position for Penn State. Pitt’s
middle blockers are 5-1 I sophomore
Carmen Tapia and 5-H junior
Ulana Kohutiak, an aggressive hit-
ter seriously challenging Barbarich’s
right to that throne. '

When asked what factor will most
likely determine the winner of this
meeting, Pitt players mentioned two
general areas: the mental aspect and
serving.

“Whoever's more determined to
win,” Gillespie asserted. '

Tapia, who played for the Puerto
Rican Naional Team, expanded
somewhat on that statement. “Con-
fidence,” she emphasized. “We have
the ability; we need the mental
toughness.” .

Rupp put it succinctly: “Going in
with an attitude of dominating
them.”

Kohutiak, however, stressed the
importance of serving effectively.
“Serving will deﬁnitely be up there,”
she said.

 

The confrontation at State Col-
legeplaces more on the line than a
long-standing rivalry and has more
far-reaching effects than quenching
the immediate thirst for revenge and
Eastern status. Pitt- is currently
ranked first in the Big East Confer-
ence,. but Providence, with a 37-9
mark, is a tight second. A Pitt loss to
the Lady Lions could spell trouble.

“Both teams will probably receive
NCAA invitations,” Collier said.
“We need to win to improve our.
seeding.” T,

Another motivating factor is the.
desire to gain‘ an edge in recruiting
over Penn State. , ~

“I anticipate that several of our‘
top recruits will be at the match,”
Collier said. “The winner will be in a.
better recruiting position, as I'm
sure many recruits have narrowed

.their choices down to Pitt and Penn

State.”

Collegiate athletes from nearby
high schools seem to have a habit of
meeting each other across the net.
Often, they are former teammates ’
and sometimes related. Kris Wex- V

ePagi§i,l7"’-. T

ell, Pitt’s defensive specialist, is a e i

1983 graduate of Norwin High
School and her half-sister, Judy
McDonough, plays for Penn State.

Six of Penn State's regulars are
natives of the Pittsburgh area.
McDonough and sisters Nancy and
Ellen Hensley are Norwin gradu-
ates, as are Pitt’s Wexell and Gilles-
pie. Lady Lions from Baldwin High
School are Vida Kernich and Lisa
Chidester. Marcy Leap spent four
years with Pitt’s Judy Young at Con-
neaut Lake High School. -

The acquaintances do not end
there. Six players facing each other
tomorrow night were teammates on
the Junior Olympics squad, which
trains athletes for national competi-
tion and of which Collier was head
coach. Representing the Lady Lions
are McDo_nough, Kernich and Ellen

Panthers  

Need

Impressive Showing

continued from page seventeen

“You go into each game with the
idea that you are going to win the
football game,” Young said. “We’ve

‘taken steps in that right direction,

‘airid there’s,no question we have a
long way to go. There’s no question
this program is just starting. It just
takes time.”

“The key to our schedule is play-
ing against -the strong teams only
twice in a season ~ teams like Bos-
ton College and Notre Dame. Week
in and week out, we can’t do that.
Teams like Navy, Air Force and
Rutgers put us on equal footing with
them.”

Besides Sartiano, about whom
Qéuoung said, “He certainly has done
t e job throughout the season,” a
second area shines like polished

boots for the Cadets. It is the perfor-
mance of Elton Akins. A split end
last season, his move to halfback has
been successful, as the 5-l0, 185 lb.
junior leads the Cadets in ‘rushing
with 627 yards. Akins also returns
kickoffs well, averaging 22.] yards
for return.

The key to tomorrow’s game is

how well prepared the Panthers are ,

— not in game plan, but in other
ways.

“Unity, that’s what it’s going to
take, a lot of unity and emotion,”
Hill said. “If you don’t have that,
you might as well not be out there.

“Against Army, we just want to
stay at a certain level, keep going up.
We are looking for an impressive
win. We’re not going down. We’ll
keep climbing.” - »

_ Home Sweet Home...

To the relief of everyone — except
the Steelers —— the Pittsburgh Maul-

-' ers and the city have reached an

agreement to allow the USFL
expansion team to play its home
games at Three Rivers Stadium.

According to Mayor Richard

‘ = Caliguiri, the city will make approx-

" revenues.

imately $500,00 in rent and tax
The ‘deal calls for the
Maulers to pay $235,000 or l0 per-
cent, of their gate receipts, depending
on which amount is higher.

The‘ deal will be called off if it
violates the lease the city has with

* the Steelers. ~

Recuiting T ime....

College basketball season is two
weeks away, yet several teams have
already signed recuits for the 1984-
85 season.

An NCAA rulepermits early sign-
ings for a one-week period..

Chris Washburn of Hickory,
N.C., signed a letter-of-intent with
North Carolina State on Wednes-
day. Washburn, a 6-1 I, 240-pound
center, was considered among the
nation's elite prep stars.

Pitt coach Roy Chipman hopes to
offer two of his three available scho-
larships duing this period, including
one to a 6-9 center from Florida.
Duquesne's Jim Satalin said he
hopes to sign 6-7 Adam.Sarson of

Peters Township and 6-10 Jim Balog
of Serra Catholic in the next few
days. '

In other signings, Georgia signed
Cedric Henderson, a 6-8 forward
from Marietta, Ga., and guard
Patrick Hamilton. Louisville
acquired Mike Abram, a 6-4 guard-
forward from Muncie, Ind., and 6-2
guard Kevin Walls of Camden, N.J.
North Carolina nabbed 6-0 Ranzino
Smith of Chapel Hill, N.C.

Pitt notes....

Flanker Dwight Collins remains
doubtful for the Army game with a
sprained ankle, as does guard Mike
Dorundo....For Army, offensive
tackle Shamus Hanlon is out,
flanker Jarvis Hollingsworth
(sprained thumb) is questionable;

presents

The

  with the

linebacker Jim Mitroka (sprained
neck) is probable; guard Church
Matthews(pinched nerve) is proba-
ble as well as nose guard Mike Stav-
er...Troy Benson‘s two interceptions
against Notre Dame gave him four
for the season, the most by a Pitt
linebacker since Sal Sunseri had five
in l980....Pitt has won the game
before Penn State eight years in a
row....A win will give head coach
Foge Fazio a 17-5 record, tying him
with Jackie Sherrill for the most
wins by a Pitt second-year
coach...The Pitt defense has not
allowed a touchdown in the third
quarter all season....Tommorrow is
ski cap day. All youths l6 and under
who enter gate 17-19 will receive a

Pitt ski cap courtesy of Rax _

Restaurants.
