1.McKinleyMayBe_DanceHead

By JOHN KULAMER

Staff Reporter

The Search for a chairman for the ﬁrst
,Commons Room dance seemed to be center-
ing today .on Student Congress V1ce-Pres1-

dent Bill McKinley.

Althoughthe date for the senior affair
has not yet been set, the question of select-
ing the man most likely to make the hard-
Won affair a success came up at SC’s Mon-

day meeting. 1

Approval Indicated

President Howard Greenberger mention-
ied McKinley’s name and the politicos ex-
pressed general approval, but no action could
be taken because of the absence of appoint-
ments committee Chairman Earl Jacob.
McKinley seemed to the solons the
man qualiﬁed for the job on the basis
of his work as chairman. of the commit-
tee which secured the administration’s

okay for the dance.

In the course_ of his work on that com-
mittee he did research on costs involved in
preparing the Commons Room for a dance,
such as applying and removing floor wax
and the installation and removal of a band-

-stand.

Success Important

Much importance is being attached to the
.selection of chairman of the affair because of
‘ ‘the necessity of its being a success. The fate
of future CR dancing hinges on whether or
not this year’s two dances, one in the Spring
and one at Christmas, go over well.
, The University Social Committee will
~ ” then have to make recommendations for
next year on the basis of the success and
experience gained from the ﬁrst two events.

Five district high schools have

quired scholastic standing,” has
given rise to many questions.
Unawswered Questions

Since Hershey has not yet giv-
en out a detailed interpretation
of Truman’s order, students are
still in the dark about these and
other questions:

Must ROTC students apply
for and take the examination?

If a student has a high
average class standing, must
he pass the examination to be
deferred?

Do students who have the
“required scholastic stand-
ing” have to take the exam-
ination at all? .

Just what is the “required
scholastic standing?”

Will high school seniors be
permitted to take the exami-
nation?

While students and educators
await Hershey’s answers, the test
is being set up by the Educational
Testing Service of Princeton,
N. J. and will be distributed to
about 1,000 examination centers
throughout the country.

Sentiment Here

Against 2 Independents

By BOB THOMAS
News Editor

The twenty-man-plus slate of Student Congress nominees
to be revealed Monday is going to show a startling lack of
independents, the News learned today. '

In fact as it stood at News deadline time the unofficial
count was fraternity nominees 21, independents 2—hardly a
fruitful ﬁeld for independent political maneuvering.

The names of the nominees were to have been announced
Wednesday by the SC Nominating Committee, but last-min-
ute difficulties ‘ﬂipped a monkey wrench into the works.
About six men turned in incomplete petitions which had to

be investigated further.

60% Vote at Ellsworth

Meanwhile at Ellsworth Center
voters survived a last-minute
rush of political campaigning
Wednesday to pick 14 men for
the Ellsworth Student Council.
Candidates used music in the Tuck
Shop, posters, and a contest- to
prod voters to the polls. Over 60%
of the students cast ballots.

William Pentecost, with 194
votes; George Stokes, with 172;
Joseph Yut, 169; Robert Guerrie,
165; and Richard Cohen, 157, led

 the balloting.

Also elected were: William Fog-
erty, 155; Arden D’Amico, 153;

§David Green, 153; Raymond Mor-
?an, 149; Richard Ulmer, 148; Har-

ry Bungard, 147; Dayne Wahl,
146; Ernest Smith, 143; and Rich-
ard Del Signore, 141. '

Voting Was Close

Voting was close all the way,
with the last six men, especially,
jammed together with only eight
votes separating them.

Speculation on the Student
Congress elections is now center-
ing around possible new parties
to oppose the usually-victorious
Interfraternity Slate. Since only
two independent candidates have
ﬁled nominating petitions, it ap-
pears likely that any resulting
parties will come from within the
ranks of IF.

Women candidates to Student
Congress will also be announced
Monday. General elections for

both men and women are set for
Wednesday, April 18,

The impact of the Loyalty Oath Bill—passed by the State
Senate, but still in the House—has struck Pitt. .
Opponents of the bill have maintained that it would re-
strict the freedom to think, a quality they deem essential for

teachers. A

A polling of faculty and stu-
dents partly substantiated this
claim.

What many of those contacted
did not say was of more possible
signiﬁcance than what others did
say.

Some students shied away
from the controversial ques-
tion on the implied grounds
that it was too hot for them
to touch.

Most People Wary

Both groups apparently were
afraid of the same thing—that
their remarks might be construed
as being sympathetic to commun-
ism- or that they might somehow
endanger the University.

All faculty members con-
tacted who did comment on
the squabble echoed in gener-
al the sentiments of Dr. Elmer

Graper, head of the Poltical
Science Department, who
said, “I think it (the bill)
would be ineffective in ac-
complishing the purposes for
which it was designed.”

Mary Jane Boyle, co—director of
Men’s Debate, put it this way. “I
doubt,” said Miss Boyle, “that even
a Joe Stalin would refuse to sign
if his job depended on it.”

Oath Proves Nothing /

Robert X. Graham, head of the
Journalism Department, remark-
ed, “The fact that a man with-
out training took the Hippocratic
oath would not make him a doc-
tor.”

Dr. John Ferguson of economics
turned the tables and questioned
his questioner. Asked the doctor,
“I cannot see. Wm‘ “M in it, can
you?”

Former Pitt
Student Held
For Robbery

Howard J. Albert, a ‘former Pitt
student was arrested last Wednes-
day for stealing books from the
Commons Room and selling them
at Headlee’s Bookstore to obtain
money for buying dope, accord-
ing to police.

They said Albert took them to
the home of Lamar and Mary
James at 68 Arthur St.

Albert entered the house and
bought three capsules of heroin
with a marked $5 bill now held
by the police.

The house was raided
James and his wife were arrested.
Upon searching the couple, police
said they discovered 73 capsules
of heroin and the marked bill.

Albert was held on larceny and
narcotics charges and James and
his wife were arrested for viola-
tion of the narcotics act.

The stolen books were returned
to the University and placed in
the Lost and Found Department
where the owners may recover
them.

Opposes ‘Oath’

last week, Dean W. I. News-
tetter of the Social Work
School, declared, “While I see
no particular harm in a pub-
lic employee, whether elect-
ed or appointed, being re-
quired to take an_ appropriate
oath of oﬂice, I think there
are better ways of judging an
individual’s ﬁtness, and of
guarding against the abuses
such bills are intending to
forestall.”

Loyalty Oath
Aired on WPGH

Three students, Dick Kovar,

Howard Greenberger, and Cyril-

Wecht, and Dr. Charles W. Tain-
tor, professor of law, will discuss
“The Loyalty Oath,” on the radio
program Pathways to Progress to-
day.

The program will be broadcast
over station WPGH at 2:45 p.m.
today and re—broadcast tomorrow
at 1:15 p.m. over WMCK.

Nationality Room Family Grows

E l'hR ' thjll Ir’
' By DEE MORGRET
Staff Reporter

A new nationality room is coming into being in 44 C.L.

This large room on the first ﬂoor of the Cathedral is
being transformed from a black shep catch-all into an honored
member of the Nationality Rooms family-—the English Room.

The history of this room, as Ruth Crawford Mitchell

executive secretaryof the com-O

mittee on educational exchange,
pointed out, is different from that
of the other 16 nationality rooms.

All the other rooms have been
constructed through the help of
people in the community of Pitts-
burgh who were interested in
helping to furnish a room com-
memorating the country in which
they were born.

A few of the rooms which have

been completed this way are the
Chinese, French, German, Scot-
tish, and Swedish.
Contemplated 24 Years

The English Room, however,
has a different background. The
idea of including such a room in
the group dates back to 1927.

In an article in the vApril Atlantic Monthly, Whitney

University, has given a new deﬁnition to the crisis now fac-
ing every American college and university.

The theme of his article is the.

channeling of the nation’s youth 1 them as far up the f°ur‘year lad‘

society at its source, the farther
we go toward stripping our col-
leges of students, dismissing their
teachers and ‘accelerating’ their
curricula, the nearer the Com-

ing that objective.”
Learning Non—Essential

The noted educator says that
we talk of college education as
non-essential and expendable.

_While we lavish our ingenuity and

resources on the weapons of war,
we neglect and even handicap the
men who will use them..

This is a high price to pay for
survival. “And what price sur-
vival” asks Griswold,” if we be-
come a headless monster?”

Griswold hits at the present ac-
celerated programs of schools
throughout the country. He op-
poses this means of survival be-
cause he maintains that the
school’s purpose is not to save the
students from the draft, or get

‘gree of Ll.D., visited Pitt then
and was impressed by the Na-
tionality Rooms. He suggested
furnishing a room in honor of
England.

His suggestion, however, was
stalemated by thepwar. It was
not until the close of the war that
Alfred Bossom, who had been
recommended by Dr. Mansbridge
to assist Pitt in building a repre-
sentative English‘ Room, made
possible gifts of material from the
bombed out Parliament House in
England.

Mr. Bosom, a well-known Eng-
lish architect, had done some
work at the start of his career
for Andrew Carnegie in Pitts-
burgh.

Paneling From Parliament

Interested in the project, he
persuaded the Speaker of the
House of Commons to permit cer-
tain pieces of stone and wood pan-
eling, left after the bombing in
1941, to be presented to Pitt “as
a symbol of the common cultural
heritage of the people of Pitts-
burgh and the English people.”

This__ original paneling will be
used on the south wall surround-
ing the fireplace. Harmonizing
with this paneling and stone
work, the rest of the room will
be designed ir the Tudor Gothic
period, a most popular time of
English architecture which has
been used in cathedrals, mansion
houses, and universities.

A modern tpuch will be added
by the use in the room of one
brick from No. 10 Downing Street,
the home of Britain’s prime min-
isters.

The money for the room———
$40,000-—was contributed by the
A. W. Mellon Educational and
Charitable Trust in recognition of
the services of Andrew Mellow as
U, S. ambassador to the Court of
St. James.

Mrs. Mitchell said that she ex-
pects the roorr. to be finished next
year.

A i One Flag Missing

Take a moment and see if you can remember what the

. United Nations Flag looks like.

If you can describe it, you deserve some sort of blue
ribbon.

We took a poll of the Pitt News staff, supposedly com-
posed of well-informed people, and less than one person in
ten had any clear ideaof the flag that Americans in Korea
are ﬁghting under

Only one in twenty was able to say that it shows the
polar projection of the globe encircled by two olive branches
on a blue ﬁeld. -

Yet this ﬂag, the symbol of the desire, at least, of people

of all nations. to work together in a common effort toward
international understanding and peace, should be as familiar

to us as our‘, own Stars and Stripes.

We are concerned with this situation, as is the student

whose letter on this subject appears on this page. He sug-
« gests that," in keeping with the theme and purpose of the
‘Nationality Rooms, the University should display the UN
‘flag in the Commons __Room, where it can be seen and rev-

erenced by all. We suggest you, read the letter.

And we join with him in asking the University to buy,
if it does not already possess, a large United Nations flag
to be placed opposite the American ﬂag that now hangs in
the Commons Room. If the University can’t afford it, then
we are sure that enough students and faculty can be found
who are interested _enough in an international patriotism as
well as a national one to contribute to a fund to buy such

aﬂag. All in favor . . .? «

    Other Places, Same Issue

~ The following editorial, which appeared in the Iowa

.'State Daily, is the best argument against Pennsylvania’s

proposed loyalty oath bill that we have yet read.
- By substituting ‘Pennsylvania’ for ‘Iowa,’’ you’ll ﬁnd the

‘ editorial represents our stand exactly.

* =3 $

The Iowa senate will make an important decision soon.
It will vote on a bill that requires courts, state and local
governments, and schools to hunt out subversive employees.
Anyone convicted of advocating, teaching or plotting

the overthrowof the United’ States’ constitutional form of

government would be ﬁned up to $10,000 and imprisoned
for 20 years. ~ ‘ . .
_ This will not be a new law, if enacted. The federal
government has made such actions a punishable offense
since 1918, and more recently in the Alien Registration
Act of 1940. Therefore passage of the bill would just
mean a duplicate .law on the books. We already have it.

The lawmakers propose to put teeth in this new bill

, by requiring that courts,’ governments and schools ferret

out subversives, and report them. Here we have the bottle-

neck of all anti—subversi've laws. How are we going to ﬁnd V

the culprits?

=l¢ 5|! *

One of the ﬁrst things a Communist party member learns
is to lie. Are we so narrow minded that we innocently be.-
lieve that Communists would refuse to sign a loyalty oath?
They would be the ﬁrst to sign it. ‘Why? Because loyalty
oaths are all to the advantage ‘of subversives. When they
take the oath they are rocking American citizens into the
false" belief that taking an oath proves loyalty.

In this sense,.loyalty oaths are the most dangerous

. -tools that we can use in our purge of the unfaithful.

Loyalty oaths have a shocking similarity to the Trojan

horse. They are a powerless means of hunting subver-
sives. ~

Any law that connot be enforced is worse than no law
at all. The nation learned this in prohibition days.

0 We agree with the state senators that we have no_place
in this school ,or in this nation for anyone advocating the
violent overthrow of our government.. But the bill now be-

fore Iowa’s legislators is a hysterical way of hypnotizing

our citizens into a false security. It is one of the best ways
to help surversives that has yet been devised, though thatis

The Real Issue

By JACK Manxowlyfi

Communists should be allowed to. teach in universities.
To me, the fundamental issue in this loyalty oath busi-
ness is whether ANYONE, expressing ANY viewpoint no
matter how unpopular, should be denied the opportunity of
being heard at a university, and whether the students should

to hear him. .

Unfortunately, even those who
oppose the loyalty oath have not

ciple.. ,

Opponents have chosen to bat-
tle it on the anythingkbut ideal-
istic ground that the oath is no
good because it won’t really catch
a communist.

But, to me, the issue runs far
deeper than that. The implication
of the anti-oathers is that if some

we COULD catch a Communist,
that method would be acceptable."
But my point is that even
if we. have proof that an in-
structor is a card-carrying

Communist, he should still be

permitted to teach. ‘
Why Feay?

For, as long we have _minds,
' what in heaven’s name have we
to fear from a Communist or his
ideas?

What kind of a “future leader
of society” is he whose conﬁ-
dence in‘ his own mind and his
society is so feeble that he is
afraid to hear a Communist speak
for fear he might be “indoctrin—
ated?”

Are our economic and political
institutions, our way of life, so
weak that they cannot stand up
under the criticism of a Com-
munist? _ _ . -

If we are in the right, should
we not be able to defend our posi-
tion against all critics?

Even the advocates of the loy-
alty oathwill agree, in the'ab-
stract, with the obvious answers
to the above questions. ‘

But the loyalty oathers will jus-
tify their position on banning
Communists by insisting that a
Communist is not just a critic,
but a conspirator, that he does not
want peaceably to change our in-

be deprived of the opportunity?

drawn the battle lines on this’
most important question of prin-‘

method were devised by which ,

stitutions, but to destroy them.
School Not Factory

I will agree that this last is an
excellent argument for keeping
Communists out of our atomic en-
ergy plants, for instance. Certain-
ly, where our physical security is
concerned, we don’t want to give
a potential enemy the chance to
start swinging monkey wrenches.

[But in a classroom, the Com-
munist’s only weapons are ideas,
and, if we are right, we are bet-
ter armed than be.

But the danger of permitting a
Communist to teach is, it is said,
that he will not present his ideas
openly but will undermine our
institutions so subtly that the stu-
dent will be actually unconscious
of the undermining.

This last argument is generously
equipped withiholes.

For if the Communist’s criticism
isiso subtle that the student is
not even aware that his way of
life is being criticized,‘ then, to
that student, there_ has actually
been no criticism.

And if the Communist is not
subtle, and the student is con-

scious of criticism, then does the "

student not have a brain which
registers when the ‘things it be-
lieves in are criticized, does he
not have a tongue to question, nor
a mind to weigh the truth?

No, -if anybody is going to
do any criticizing, the students
will know it. .

Yet this idea of a Communist’s
being able to put over anything
and everything on the modern
student has some "importance in
this discussion.

Here's Looking at You

It gives a good indication of
the heighth of esteem in which
the proposes of loyalty oaths
seems to hold the modern stu-
dent. . ‘

Apparently the oathers think

students a r e‘ . all intellectua
buckets—every idea that is pour"-
ed into them, they accept ’and
"hold to, making no distinction
between right and wrong, ,good

V, and bad. .

I say that if you accept 511
idea that Communists shouldnf.
be allowed to teach because th
modern student is not capableo

College men are not exempt

What it does do,is encourage
the country’s young men to seek
more education, more help in
learning how to live in an in-
creasingly. complex world, wheth-
er‘they are studying at Pitt or any
college or university‘ in the U.S.

From ,_ another quarter, ‘the
March issue of Harper’s, comes
the well-modulated voice of Ger-
ald W. Johnson, protesting that
the plan for exempting the better
college students from the draft is
unfair ‘and’ without justification
since the atom bomb and the Al-
ger ‘Hiss case proved that intel-
lectuals are not necessarily the

Ruark’s shotgun blast and
Johnson’s more cautiously word-

between the. words exempted and
deferred.

When the Panther trackmen travel to Miami of Ohio to

on a season of worries and uncertainties. __

Although his thinclads set ﬁve new meet records at this

in returning co-captains Dick

Sports Editor

I agree with Ted Williams.

The Boston Redsox outﬁelder recently went on record
with the statement that spring training is just a waste of
time. Ted went on to say that playersdo not need all that

time to get into condition. 9
I'll go along with Ted on his

I views of spring training baseball,I

and even go a step further with

regard to spring training foot-
ball.
As you know, the immensely

popular spring grid drills got un-
derway here at Pitt last week and
the players are just bursting with
enthusiasm over the prospects of
the six-weeks grind.
Real Enthusiasm

As enthusiastic, may I point out,
as inductees waiting their call.

The charge has frequently

been‘ leveled that spring grid

drills are conducted merely

to give the coaches work, and

that the beneﬁcial effect to

the players is negligible.

Whether that  the case or not
is a moot question, but it appears
carrying football over into
an off-season does have its bad
points. I

Certainly the conditioning the
players get in the spring does not
carry over the long layoff until
fall drills. A more intensiﬁed late
and early fall practice
would probably accomplish much
more than spring drills could ever
hope to.
Gridders Get Kicks

Then again, football in the
spring prevents the gridder from
competing in any other sport. A
player would have to eat, sleep,
and drink football in order to get

spring. A normal athlete would
prefer baseball or one of the other
spring sports.

ample, the grid halfback could not
play baseball for the mittmen
this spring because he has to de-
vote his time to football drills.

Reynolds is a good outfield

prospect, but his baseball ability
is being neglected. Undoubtedly
there are others who would rather
be competing in a regular sea-
sonal sport.

Just a Job

Spring drills has taken foot-
ball out of the category of
sport and has made 9. job of
it. The players go through the
motions of football in lack-
adaisical fashion, just count-
ing the days till practice ends.
After all, it’s a way to get
through college.

So if the attitude and interest

aren’t there, just how much can

the coaches expect to accomplish?

Spring drills could probably be
eliminated with little detrimental
effect on the next season’s team.

  Women Grads to Have

Rosyfob Future

Pitt women graduating in June and on the lookout for
jobs can relax, according to Mrs. Patricia Byers, head of the
Women’s Placement Bureau here.

The job outlook is bright, she said, and women with a

major in math, chemistry, physics,‘

secretarial, business, or teaching
will have a wide variety of job
opportunities to choose from.

Science Offers Hope

The biggest demand is in the
scientiﬁc research ﬁelds as indus-
tries step up,/their search for new
and better products to meet de-
fense needs. '

In some cases, according to re-
ports, women will be able to name
their own salaries.

In the teaching ﬁeld, the demand
for elementary school teachers is
as great as ever. Library work
also has many job opportunities,
says Mrs. Byers.

Training Executives

The demand is so great that
some industries have touched on
the idea of placing women in their
executive training programs for
junior executives, but as yet
nothing deﬁnite has taken place.

Nominees Advised
The Senior Court of WSGA ad-

rvises all women eligible for elec-

tive positions either to remain at
home tomorrow or leave notiﬁca-
tion there of where they can be
,:reached. A

This will facilitate their work
in clearing ,the names of those

1 nominated for campus positions.

Seems You Can’t
Believe All
That You See

If you're the type of person
who believes everything he
sees, you’re liable to be con-
fused after seeing the “dis-
tortion box” in the psychology
department on the 16th ﬂoor.

The box is about six feet
square and seven feet high
with a small round hole in
one of the walls. Viewed
through the hole_ the inside of
the box appears to be per-
fectly cubical. ,

A small steel ball rests on a
trough which appears to be

side of the box to the other.

When someone on the other
side of the box rolls the ball
down the trough the observer
sees it roll down and then
back up the trough, appar-
ently defying the law of grav-
ity.

Entering the other side of
the “distortion box,” the ob-
server discovers that the
“square” box is in reality a
very much distorted cube,
with no two sides the same,
and that the steel ball is act-
ually rolling down the trough.

As Lecturer Jerome Cohen,
one of its builders, remarked.
“It just goes to show you that

as they seem.”

In order to take the examina-

age must apply at their draft
board oﬁices about April 12. Here
they may obtain tickets granting
them admission to the rooms in

To Build Up Forces

Students deferred under the
plan will be classiﬁed by their
local boards as “Class II—A(S).”

The purpose of the new defer-
ment plan was stated by Major
General Hers-hey, who said that,
“Since we can not hope to match
the Iron Curtain countries in
manpower our advantage lies in
our superiority in scientiﬁc and
technical know how.” ~
