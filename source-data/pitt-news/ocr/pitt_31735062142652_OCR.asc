8,000 V eterans
Reg'ster at Pitt

With registration nearing com-
pletion, more than 8000 veterans
will attend the University tx‘lS fall
according to Mr. J. E. Ricart, as-
sistant .to Dean of Men.

As of Friday, 7600 ex-GI’s al-
ready were enrolled; however,

this did not include various Pitt
extension centers, such as Johns-

town and Erie.

Registration adjustment ends at
3 p. in. today for day students
with evening adjustments‘ con-
tinuing through Thursday. .

Tuesday was the heaviest day
for the Veteran’s Administration.
Nearly 2000» went througl the
processing.

This inﬂux of vets added a dif-

ficult housing problem to the al-
ready critical one. The Dean of
Men’s office tended to alleviate
the situation by providing 1500
men w.ith living quarters.
I Mr. C. H. Ebert oi the dean’s
office initiated a canvassing pro-
gram to acquire the vnuch need-
ed rooms. All people who former-
ly housed Pitt students were sent
letters, requesting them to take
students. This was in addition to
radio announcements and classi-
fied ads.

' By noon Friday. M... William F.
Saalbach, assistant to Dean of
men, and Miss Carolyn Miller‘, a
secretary on the Dean’s staff.
handled 368 phone calls. These
calls netted 600 single rooms, 24
double rooms and 33 apartments.

The Pitt Veterans‘ association
staged a drive of its own, a mem-
bership campaign. The group had
a booth at registration and Wyn
Smith, secretary, said that near-
ly, 1000 new members \vere
brought into the fold .

The organization is the largest
on campus vcilh 1500 students
participating.

Twelve Credits
Now Setlfor
Activities Card

University students now carry-
ing 12, 13. or 14 credits are eligi-
blc for a student activities card,
free of charge, and may call for
them at the Treasurer’s oﬁice,
2409 CL.

This decision to change the nor-
mal requirement of 15 credits was
announced by Theodore W. Bid-
dle, dean of men, after action
Friday by University deans. The
new system applies only to the
current semester.

Mr. Biddle stated that because
of the great increase in enroll-
ment and consequent restriction
of the range of subject choices.
many students came through reg-
istration with less credits than
they had originally intended tak-
ing.

Many were willing at the be-
ginning to carry 15, 16, or even
18 hours but had to whlttle their
schedules down to 12, 13, or 14.

Mr. Biddle also pointed out that
the Veter..n’s Administration con-
siders 12 credits a full schedule,
a decision which guided many
vets during registration.

Students need only show their
registration card for the cur-
rent semester with a paid—lor ac-
knowledgement ol’ 12 or more
credits.

All students in the 12, 13, and
14 credit bracket who already
have purchased an activities card

To Continue

About 25’grade and high schools
in the Pittsburgh area will work
side by side with the School of
Education in conducting a coun-
ty-wide education lab this semes-
ter. ‘

The laboratory period. which
was introduced during the sum-
mer session, will enable students
to observe different methods of
teaching.

Juniors in the School of Educa-
tion will spend a hall‘ day each
week in one of the 25 schools.
After each visit, students, will
write a critical report based on
their observations. Group confer-
ences led by Mr. Lee Ellsworth,
who is in charge of the lab. will
follow each visit.

According to Dr. Sones of the
School of Education. this lab pe-
riod is preparatory for student
teaching, and later educational
work. Dr. Sones cited an example
of how students may become la-
miliar with the varying methods
of education.

In some schools_, one teacher
will remain with hi-s
the first three years. In other
schools students change teachers
witlreach grade. Comparisons of
the two methods may be made
along with the observ'...tior. of ad-
vantages and_ clisadvamages.

Some of the SCl1()Ol> participat-
ing in laboratory program" are:
Holmes. Colfax. and Letsche ele-
mentary schools; Prospect. Her-
ron Hill. and Mellon Junior higli
schools: and Oliver and Wilkins-
burgh senior high schools.

Congratulations and best wishes are in order to the ‘new”
~Pitt band, and to Mr. Robert L. Arthur, band director, whose
‘efforts can only be repaid_by the gratitude felt bynew Pitt
students who surely felt a surge of pride as they_ saw the Pitt
band, 120 strong, march onto the ﬁeld before Satur.day’s game,
and by the old Pitt students, who upon seeing the band for
the. ﬁrst time, and remembering the Pitt band of pre-war days,
wanted to say over and over again, “At last Pitt is Pitt again 1”

We would like to extend, too, our thanks to Mr. E. V.
Babcock, who helped make possible a performance that equaled,
if not surpassed, Pitt band fame of old. And to everyone else
who helped we would like to say simply,’ “'l‘l1anks!”.

For most of us registration is over this semester, so per-

haps we should let the memory of that grueling day rest in
its shadowy corner.. Perhaps it’s a case of locking the barn
door too late but could We suggest to‘ those concerned a way
to help Pitt students of the future look forward to registration
with more than a grimace on their countenance?
A Elsewhere on this page is a letter written by a student re-
turning to Pitt, after service in the Army. His is typical of the
‘opinions held by students as they reached the “ﬁnish line” at
registration. — ‘

The suggestion is that seniors be allowed to register ﬁrst.
Thereismore to this than a whim of a senior impressed by
his own importance. By the time a student reaches the level

of a senior, he has nearly completed requirements in his course.
Often there are but one or two classes in a ﬁeld that he has not
taken. If one of these should conflict with another required
course, the student is left with no choice but to take the alter-
nate course. If, then, that course has been closed due to pre-
vious registrations of underclassmen, a senior may graduate
deprived of a desired class or ﬁnish the semester minus several

K

G credits necessary for him to graduate.

It can not beroverlooked that the various departments do
try to avoid these situations by giving instructions by appoint-
ment and other methods. However, would it not be simpler to
allow seniors to register ﬁrst, avoiding such difﬁculties, and
making for a more efﬁcient set-up in the long run? ‘K

the Pitt News. Letters are invited, but we ask that they be limited in
length. A maximum of 150 words will be accepted ‘for print. Often

Therefore, although names must be signed to letters wished printed
we will withhold names upon request. -

To the Editor of the Pitt News,

It seems very odd to me that
the University should set up its
registration week each year so as
to keep juniors and seniors from
registering until the last possible
moment. -

It would appear logical that
freshmen and sophomores have
‘ample opportunity to rearrange
their schedules in their last two
‘years in order to get courses, they
need; whereas, seniors have, no
further chance, once they start
the last year.

I believe that seniors and jun-
iors deserve priority at registra-

Reporters, feature ‘ writers.

Welcome you wonderful less-

than-a-thousand . .- . and a halt.-
hearted hello to you 13,000 men.

Now that refrustration week is
past and we have rid ourselves
of that last doze of summer, we
can get down to work again.
Why? . . Dr. Foraker seems to
have the best answer: “We go
to school to learn to make $3000
a year and spend $4000.” With
the income tax what it is, that
sounds like a good »dea. Maybe
_we would end up with the gov-
ernment owing us money. A de-
sirable situation, says Bob 0’Con-
nor, who ﬁnes that an O. 5. Q. P.
is in the same category.

It was a rather confusing week.
Upperclass counselors had lots of
fun trying to ﬁt 1500 new fresh-
men into Room 132. John Koenig,
one of les miserables who inhabit
the engineering school, was
shocked into unreality when his
advisor began sugges ing liberal
arts courses in lieu of the already
closed technical courses. When
John came to his senses he found
himself enrolled in music appre-
ciation. As the week passed by,
more and more day students dis-
covered that they’d loaded them-
selves with evening classes .'
With so many people, there was
bound to be some confusion, but
such organized confusionl It was
wonderful. 0

You could ﬁnd, a great variety
of people crawling about under
the tables. I met one freshman
under “Classics.” His greeting was
classic, too: “Crowded isn’t it?”

Time was when we could ex-
pect light in the Commons Room
one or two weeks around regis-
tration. With registration at the
Mosque this year, we have to
continue saying hello to those
shadowy forms in the dark room
Anever know when one might
turn out to be a friend._ In other
aspects you will ﬁnd old Uni lit-
tle changed. There still aren’t any
beach chairs on the lawn. The
Tuck Shop lacks air — of the
breathing variety. And the lock-
er situation is unchanged. Asked
a fellow the other day if he had
room for another in his locker.
“Locker?” he said, “Locker? -

they have lockers for students-

here?”-

Text Books Needed-

Men’s Council book store is in
urgent need of freshman and

The program will open on Fri-
day evening at 6:15 when the
Pitt Lettermen’s club will hold
its annual dinner at Webster
Hall. Dr. William B. McClel1and,
president of this group, will make
the arrangements.

Followingthe banquet, which is
closed to everyone except Pitt
monogram winners, there will be
lavish entertainment beginning at
8:00 at the same hotel with many
celebrities slated to appear as
guests for the evening. Among
those taking bows will be Bill
Kern and Emil Naric, members
of the West Virginia coaching
staff and former Pitt gridders.

Mayor David E. Lawrence will
be on-hand for the fun.

/

this Saturday.
Kern left the West Virginia
enter the Naval Reserve, and he

over, the coaching reins in 1940.
Buddy Freese, a Panther half-

back in 1944, will do his tossing
for the Mounties this year. Freese
is considered the steadiest passer
on the squad. Jimmy Devonshire,

will probably be at the other half-
back post.
Walthall May Reiurn

Coach Kern would readily trade
thirty Mountaineer shotguns for
the discharge of Jimmy Walthall
from the Army. Walthall, an out-
standing triple-threat freshman in
1944, is rated as one of the great-
est halfbacks in West Virginia
history. His presence would bol-
ster the Mountaineer backﬁeld
immeasurably. Although he is ex-
pected to be released shortly, it
is doubtful that Walthall will play
Saturday.

Rex Bumgardner, a veteran
from Clarksburg, is slated. for the
blocking quarterback assignment.
He was a standout on the 1941
freshman team.

The Mountaineers haven’t trim-
med the Panthers since 1928 and
nothing would give Kern more
pleasure than to upset the dope
this year. 9

and will show a starting line lack-
ing neither experience nor quality.
Moran Promising

Prominent among the linemen
is Jim Moran, a towering end
from Wilkes-Barre, Pa. Moran,
big and rough, shows signs of be-
coming a great terminal. Ed Kula-

this year. .

Gene Corum, a standout in
1941-42, will appear at one of thq

Benjamin may show up at center.
The Lion is noted for abilities at

 Teacher Shortage
 L . Worries Schools

_ The trouble with teachers in
grade and high schools is that
there aren’t enough of them.

That's the conclusion reached. by
G. W. Hoffman, head 01' the Stu-
dent Personnel and Placement
bureau. The demand for teachers
far exceeds the supply, he claims.

Greatest shortages, he ﬁnds, are
in the ﬁelds of physical sciences,
mathematics, commercial subjects‘
and physical education.
I In announcing that 56 members
~  of the 1946 class of the School of
‘Education have taken teaching
positions in Western Pennsylva-
nia schools, Mr. Hoffman also re-
ported that several are teaching
as far away as Florida and Cal-
ifornia.

But the 1946 grads we.ren’t
, nearly enough. In the Pittsburgh
 districtalone, lVIr. Hoffman la-
. mented, there are 113 teaching
, vacancies in elementary schools
 and 367 invsecondary schools.

  New and enlarged edition
"REFERENCE DA1'Ai‘or RADIO ENGINEERS”

Compiled especially for Radio Engineers,
Students of Engineering, Educators, Electronic

Technicians, Radio Amateurs, Inventors.

Tho second edition of this widely accepted pocket-size halid-
book . . . revised and enlarged . . . now ‘includes important
radio technical data developed during the war.

Compiled jointly by the physicists and electronic specialists
of the Federal Telecommunication Laboratories and the
International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation, the
material inthis new book has behind it. the technical authority
of an organization with international leadership in radio,
communications and television.

Enlarged from 200 to 336 pages with over 400 charts and
diagrams, it makes available quickly the answers to problems

’ that normally arise in practical radio work._This ready refer-

ence feature is one reason why Reference Data for Radio
Engineers, in its earlier edition, received such an enthusiastic
welcome by electronic specialists. Orders totaled more than
50,000 copies. With the wealth of new material now included,
the second edition can be of even greater aid to the practicing
radio engineer.

Commenting on the first edition, Walter J. Seeley. Chair-
man, Department of Electrical Engineering, Duke University,.
wrote enthusiastically:

“It is so chock full of useful data that I am urging all smdent.s
to purchase their own personal copies . . . fills a long-felt need
for a convenient compilation of both mathenmlical and engi-
neering data, and the combination will be appreciated by all
who have to work with radio circuits and their concomitant
mathematics. That applies especially to teachers and students
and I should not be surprised if it becomes a must in many
college courses.”

The new, second edition of Reference Dom for Radio Engi-
neers, .in green cloth binding, revised and enlarged to include
much new data, is ready now. To order, merely fill in the
