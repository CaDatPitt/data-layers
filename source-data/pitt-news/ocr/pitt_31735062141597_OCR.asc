rule ‘will be strictly carried out._"l‘hc
same rule will apply at the. time. of

all .probability --part of the ﬁrst. week
in ‘April, will be the time ‘for ex-
changing the student -‘ticket. Deﬁnite

It is the desire or the management
to treat all students fairly in the is-

ORANGE DEBATERS  
  DEFEAT, prrr TEAM

By a divided‘ decision in a hotly
fought contest, the University debat-
ing team was defeated by Syracuse
University last Friday evening in Car-
negie Lecture Hall. The subject of
debate was “Resolved, that ’ the
United States Should-Join the League
of Nations.” Pitt upheld the_afﬁrI_na-
ti-ve. , ' -

The Syra

 

 

cuse team was ‘composed

Carthy, and Daniel‘ J. F. Flood. An-
thony W. Smith, L. A. Scholpp, and
Charles R.’ Foster, Jr., with David IS*il-
verblatt as alternate, were the local
debaters. Thejudges, all Pittsburgh
men, were James H. Gray, Esq., ‘and
W. Clyde Grubbs, Esq., attorn_eys-at-
law, and Fred ‘L. -Homer, professor
at Schenley High, School.  Chancellor
John Gabbert Bowman, presided. The
debate was managed by James F. Mc-
Naul, Jr.,.and Edward -O. :Spotts, Jr.

The? affirmative argued that the
League is a necessary, proper, and
adequate form of international organi-
zation, that the United States. would
proﬁt greatly by joining it, and that
America owes -it to the world to‘ enter
the League because ofthe wide-spread
good thatwould follow such entrance.
It was pointed‘ out that the League is
an’ American idea, -put across by v
American endeavor,-and represents a
thing for which,-the world h_as been
striving for ages. . .‘Ma.inta_.in_ing that
the old economic system has proved
itself; ‘a failure, the team showed that
there is only one alternative left, the
use of some such organization as the
League .of Nations. The‘ aﬂirma-tive
also argued that since,-‘ as the nega-
tive admitted, the world. is an. eco-
nomic unit, America herself must
proﬁt greatly -by a stabilization of_

with a. -plea for the puttingaside of
prejudice, and for America to tak_e

 Precious stones have always -played

"size and incalculable value. .
Today rubies and sapphires as large

and identical . in composition._ and-
splendor with those ofMo.ther.Na-
ture’s mines, are vmanufacitured -in
the laboratory. ,' What formerly‘
brought hundreds of ‘dollars per karat

joy their play of light— and ﬂash» of
ﬁre. .v - -  .

Professor «Sllverman will tell about
their manufacture and will display a
large collection of the laboratory“gems.'
This lecture will _also'include”expe;-i-’
ments in which rubies are actually
created. ' ' . 5 ., H.

The basket. -ball season -just past

of ‘those

gain. ? Fora «time it lVooked§ as if the
Italians would help them but then
the Faclsti came into power and said
they would give something when they
got something in return. '

“At ﬁrst the Germans -made their

later _they,.bega.n to-slip back more
and more until they were declared in
default by the French‘ and the inva-
sion of the _Ruhr began. The English

feat of Lloyd George, and begin to
turn the_i_r’attention‘ to ‘oil lands in the

« "‘‘jWhen.,V-the allied nations __ assem-
bled at" Versailles to have Germany

intention- to make -Germany pay for
the war. V They ‘were dissuaded, how-
ever, by England and America who
promised to sign atreaty which would
guarantee the French against "German
attack. When this treaty’ was not
ratiﬁed by the American Senate, the
French became more stern in their de-
mands on Germany.‘ T.he French gov-
ernment had depended upon the Ger-
man reparation and coal to such an
extent that it was a case of going into
bankruptcy if they were not secured.
When the Germ'ans.ma‘de no further
effort to make the payments the_pres-
ent_ policy was adopted to keep from
going into bankruptcy. V V

The present invasion is not a mili-
tary occupation but an invasion by.
the~French to see that the‘ coal which

costing the Frenchias much as is sup-
posed for most of the soldiers usedin
the occupation. were all ready mnder
arms and the only additional cost is
the transportation ‘of supplies and
food. It looks asthough the French
would stay there forever if the Ger-
mans did not meetthe demands im-
posed upon her. The invasion is sim-
ply a case of determining who won
the war and if the Germans evade
payments they will have ‘won though
they lost while the French will have
lost though they won.‘ ‘
“When France was invaded by
Prussia in 1870, Germany was very
much of an agricultural nation as

and coal she "developed into a vast in-
dustrial power. It may be that France
will emerge from the present crisis-
just as Germany did in 1870. If «she
does, the ‘French will grow as .the
Germans did.” A‘ V V ' ' ‘V

op Mann attributed the little knowl-
edge of real conditions to the news-
paper’s reluctance in rese'rving’mo're
space for international news. “Amer-
ica,” he said, “cannot live by lV1e_rs.elf~.’
She must interest herself in-the af-

-fairs of other nations and eventually

enter into a workable League of Na-
tions.” '  V ' VV
After an address of welcome by. G.
.Amagnostache,. Miss Esther N. Smith
answered. in behalf of the Associa-'
tion of University Women. She urged

American ' Women to "receive foreign,

students -in order to give them an op-
portunity of observing American
home’ life. The evening‘ was con-
cluded ‘by a musical program.

{When I entered; the University in
1879 it was the University of Western
Pennsylvania and occupied a building
about eighty feet square‘ and three
stories high at Ross and Diamond
streets, -opposite the County Court
House. , There wasa. three story an-
nex"a.lso on Ross street, a building
probably forty feet by one hundred of
which the second floor was occupied
by the Preparatory, Department.’ in
it I spent my first year. -
There were about eighty to one hun-
dred studentsin the Preparatory De-
partment and from one hundred to
one hundredvand ﬂfty in the univer-
sity proper. '

The faculty was made up. of Dr.
Woods, Chancellor and ‘Professor of
Political and Social Science; Pro-
fessor Goff, Mathematics; Professor
Phillips, ‘Chemistry; Professor R.
Schweintz, Physics and Drawing; Pro-
fessor Barbour, Latin and. Logic; Pro-
fessor Griggs, Greek; Professor
Danse, French; Professor Rohnbacker,
German; Professor. Crane} HISIOPY;
Lieutenant Osgood, Civil Engineering
and Military «Science; Professors Lud-
den, Tucker, and Coffin ran the Pre?’
paratory Department.

in, 1882 the county court house"
burned and the University buildings
‘were sold to the county forcourts and
offices. .. .-

.We moved to Allegheny and were
housed iii two theological seminar-ies
for two years until the bnuilldlngson
Observatory Hill were ﬁnished. ‘

..Dr. -Mccracken, afterwards Chan-
cellor of the University of New York
succeeded Dr. Woods in-‘1882 and Dr.’
Carhart ‘took’ Lieutenant‘ Osgoods’
place the same year and organized the
Engineering School. The earlier
classes in Engineering included very
little other than the draughting and
surveying with a smattering of theo-
reticai mechanics. ‘ -

I graduated in Engineering in 1883
from the United Presbyterian Theo-
logical Seminary, (building) but ‘was
handedomy ‘parchment in one of the
theatersof Pittsburgh. When the Uni-
versity moved to Allegheny the Pre-
paratory Department was “divorced”
and became Park Institute.

There were some very brilliant
young men in the-class of 1883, in-
eluding Et-heibert Nevin, one of Amer-
ica's best pianists and, composers,

Although there may have been some
connection between the University
and the Schools of Law and Medicine,
the affiliation was,so_ slight that the
student body did. not know of it nor
did the Chanceillor have any jurisdic-
-tion over them. . —
There were ;no athletics“no‘r Greek
Letter chapters. There were two lit-
erary societies, “Philomathian" and
“Irving.” They sometimes had joint
debates but on account of the rivalry
being too strong-armed they usually
preferred to take debates with other
college societies instead. '
“Phlio,”.'as we called it, ran a really
good monthly literary magazine for a
few years with Frank Fish and the
Thompsons (there were three broth-
ers in the same class) as editors.
‘When the Thompsons went to',Pr'ince-
ton to “finlsh" the magazine died.
from ‘lack of interested editorial tail-
ent. “Philo” had an “Inner Circle”
and each member had either a night
key or pentioned “Mike” the janitor.
Pretzels, beer and cards, with corn-
cob pipes made things ‘lively when
the f‘im1er Circle” met and it was live-
lier than ever when a member of_'lr'v-
ing Society put Dr. Woods “wise” and
he visited a session. His knock was
answered by F. W. Jehkins (later
Lieut. Jenkins, U. S. N., who died on

in Havana harbor) Jenkins had both
cards and beer in his hand when he
opened the door.’ Dr. Woods dis-
persed the meeting but never again
referred to the subject. The meet-
ings were discontinued as a matter of
honor in reciprocation of the Doctor's
fine action. ‘_ M I '

The scholastic work done at W. U.
P. was generally acknowledged to be
equal to that of the best eastern col.-
legesand the fact that the Thompson
boys could go! on at Princeton and
graduate without any loss of class
standing is one illustration. (Dr.
Thompson, thefather, was pastor of
the Third United Presbyterian Church
but accepted a call elsewhere which
explains why the Thompsons did not
continue and graduate at -W. U. .P.)
.After graduating I-had ample oppor-
tunity to compare the work at W. U.
P. with other colleges and can testify
personally to its high quality.

Professors Sweintz, Phillips, Goff,
Gibbon and others stood at the head
of their professions together with
Langlley and Keeler at the Allegheny
Observatory, and those who made up
the student body in the “eighties” can
‘look back proudly to quality if not to
numbers. This is not a suggestion
that the quality dropped as the num-
ber increased,-it is only a reflection
,upon the communityythat did not ap-
preciate that it had a high class insti-
tution of learning. and i.t,was not'un-

HE-Vice-President of a great life insurance
company who began his career as an agent
has this to say to seniors who are about to
graduate from college:

“If you love work and desire to pursue an honorable,
useful and lucrative mission in life’ this is the business
for you to take up. Life insurance salesmanship offers *

a ﬁne ﬁeld for the energies of the splendid young men A
in ourcolleges. ’ ' ’ '

“That this is’ true is demonstrated by those college men
whohave taken up life insurance for they have shown
that the college ‘man is ﬁt for this kind of a job and -
that the job also is ﬁt for the college man.

“The work of the lifeinsurance salesman is distinguished
byindependence and opportunityfor directing his own.
It gives all possible opportunity for individual initiative
and a chance to make an ample income_ at an age when

.most fellows are struggling on a wage pittance.”

. That is the story of one who began at the bottom and
reached the top without the help of a college educa-
tion. The advantages are with you who graduate
from college. ‘Before deciding your career make ine
quiries of the “Agency Departrnent.-”

PBANOUET mm

The basket -ball season will come to

an oﬂicial close’tomorrow‘~ ght when
the sec'oIPid. annual Y. M. C. A. banquet
will be given in honor «of. the Varsity
and Freshman basketball teams. The
banquet will be heldiat the First Bap-
tis_t—,_ Church and the festivities will
begin at six o’clock. Dr. Riddle will
be -toastmaster, assuring those who at-
tend the function’ of a sufﬁcient num-
‘ber of witty remarks to ‘make the
evening a success.~ Dr. Riddle» will be
remembered as the man who.‘ made
famous that now familiar saying, “I
would rather be -.a loser onia Pitt team
than a winner on any other team.”
-Dr. Riddle is associated with the Mel-
lon Institute, and is one of the chief
exponents and spirited backers of Pitt
athletics.
_ Herb Mccracken, football mentor at
Allegheny College, will be the prin-
cipal speaker of the evening. Herb is
one of the most popular men that ever
"graduated from the__University and
also one,of the most versatile ath-
letes. Herb.’s address will undoubt-
edly contain some enlightening-facts,
not only along athletic lines, but also
along life problems, Last year Herb
wasassociated with -the ,Pitt “Y” and
in this capacity ‘he earned many
-friends. who will turn out tomorrow
evening to-hear him. _ i P 

Other speakers will be Coach Carl-
son of-. the ‘Varsity, -and Coach Mc-
Masters of the Freshmen, ‘Byers, re-‘
tiring chaptain, an_d the captain-elect.
Letters will be awarded to Captain
Bye-rs,—.Rose, Jordan, Levinson, Carr
and Manager 'Eyesell. Freshman
numerals will beawarded to Hawkins,
Parson, Chase, Thoreson and James.

This function. should -be Well at-
tended and indications point to a
much larger crowd than -last year. Pitt
spirit is known all over the eastern
part of the country, in fact, all over
the country since the football team‘
went to, California last December. The
students owe it not only .to themselves
to -'attend,'butP as a means of express-
ing their__a'pprec1'ation of the athletes
efforts to place Pitt foremost in the
world of sports. '

The initial call to the baseball men
has been sent out by the"coaches' and
for the past week a large squad of
battery men have been limbering up

will be in ﬁne condition by the time
the weather permits outdoor practice.

Captain “Lefty” Hill, Curry, Swe-
tonic, and Noble are working diligent-

Pitt team should, have few worries
concerning. its twirlers. ,Hi1l will
probably be given a job? at ﬁrst base,
and‘« stay thereﬂas long as the other
pitchers are putting the “stuff” on -the
ball.

Coach Harley’s problem atpresent
is that of the inﬁeld. He must get

aspirants for the third base job, but
it is probable that one of them may

for a place in the-inﬁeld.

The Freshman‘ squad is also in
active preparation for a hard sched-
ule. .Al'Schmidt,'”‘form_er1y of‘ Alle-

twirlers at present. The schedule, as
far as it has been prepared, is a hard’
one. It includes games with Slippery
