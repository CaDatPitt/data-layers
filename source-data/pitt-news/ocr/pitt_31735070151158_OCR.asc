The Student Government Board
once again revisited the Colle-
giate Readership Program this
week, but this time with a new
focus for the future —- marketing.

A meeting held Tuesday af-

n ternoon between representatives

from The New York Times, USA
Today and members of the Stu:
dent Government Board allowed
Board members to assess the ef-
fect of the Collegiate Readership
Program, which has granted all
non— CGS Pitt undergraduates

free on—campus access to the two -

newspapers since 2011. Accord-
ing to Board member Dave Rosen-
thal, the program’s liaison on the
Board, the pick—up rates of both
newspapers have dropped signiﬁ-
cantly since the fall semester. To

‘ increase readership, Rosenthal

aims to engage students through
different marketing measures.‘

, After Tuesday”s weekly public
SGB'meeting, during which Board

:members provided updates on
-their campus initiatives, Rosen-
- thal said’ that the 75 percent

newspaper pick-up rate from the
fall semesterdropped to a pick-
up. rate of 60 percent this spring.
He attributed the decreaseto the

put in place in April 2012 with

medium range of tuition costs with an
average per—year net price of $20,076.
According to the Chronicle of Higher Edu--

tuition at a four—year public university in
2012 was $8,655.

While Beeson praised the Obama
administration’s efforts to help inform
students and combat the rising costs of
higher education, she pointed out that the
ﬁve factors evaluated by the president’s
scorecard don’t provide a thorough pic-
ture of a University. She pointed out that
other measures aimed at informing high
school students on the cost—effectiveness
of their potential universities have been
under way for several years, and Pitt has

said. ~

Out of the 625 newspapers delivered to
campus each day, students have picked up
374 on average so far this spring semester.
SGB pays only for the newspapers that are
picked up. g

In terms of marketing options, Rosen-
thal said he was looking to employ tabling
tactics to urge students to take advantage
of the free access to both the physical cop-
ies and online editions of the newspapers.

“The representatives provided us with
marketing materials like posters and pins,”
Rosenthal said.

Board President Gordon Louderback
announced at the meeting that the Board
will vote on the fate of the program for the
next school year on April 2. V

In his weekly report to about 30 people
gathered in Nordy’s Place of the William
Pitt Union, Louderback also recapped the
meeting he and other members held with
club sports leaders last week. Noting that
he was glad the teams came to the Board to
work out the problem — a disagreement
over funding caps placed on the sports
“teams by the SGB Allocations Committee

— Louderback stressed that students who
do not feel represented should feel*com—
fortable approaching the Board members
to solve problems.

During the meeting, Board member
Mike Nites said"he> was making strides in
his effort to make the SGB Allocations pro-
cess for requests of allotments from the
Student Activities Fund available online,
and said he spokewto a representative who
works with the database Symplicity about
the possibility of doing so. Nites plans
touse Symplicity to put the Allocations
process online, and said he is currently
working through kinks in the process.

:;Board ‘member Sowmya Sanapala said
Americans for=Informed:Democracy has a
meeting with the University later this week
to urge the campus to become affiliated
with the Workers Rights Consortium, an’
organization that monitors labor condi-
tions internationally. In encouraging ad-
ministrators to hire the WRC to monitor
companies Pitt buys clothing from, AID
hopes to ensure that garments bought by
the=University are not produced under
inhumane conditions. * ’ ~

5fThe.University is currently contracted
with-3the_ Fair Labor Association, a different
monitoring organization. Thepetition to A
affiliate Pitt with the WRC is going well,
according to Sanapala.‘ Sanapala is work-
ing with AID.as part of one of her three
projects as —a »-Boiard member.

In her efforts to better sexual health
on campus, Sanapala said she was look-

ing to set up a meeting with the Allegheny
Health Department to find out its stance
on sexual health.

Board member Amelia Brause provided
an update on her project to implement
a Fundraising Week in the Fall 2013 se-
mester, and said that planning was in full
swing. She urged students to come forward
to participate in the event.

“My main goal is to really motivate
students to work hard to fundraise for
charity,” Brause said.

licly display their statistics online.

In contrast to the College Scorecard’s '

five criteria, the College Portrait uses
more than 100 different characteristics
that are available to evaluate universities.
In Beeson’s opinion, the greater number of
categories allows the portrait to provide a

S “richer value of what a Pitt education is.”

She noted that it explains unique aspects
of the University such as the Outside the
Classroom Curriculum and opportunities
for undergraduate research.

According to Obama, once fully de— .
veloped, the College Scorecard will be as

tool that “parents and students can use
to compare schools based on a simple
criteria: where you can get the most bang
for your educational buck.”

The scorecard isn’t the only strategy
Obama introduced in February to com-
bat quickly climbing education costs. The
president also proposed basing federal aid
to universities off their efforts to make
tuition more affordable, a move that would
alter the Higher Education Act originally
proposed by President Lyndon B. Johnson
in 19§5. ‘ — ’ 1

“Colleges must do their part to keep
costs down, and it’s our-job to make sure
they do,” Obama said during his Feb. 12
address. ' ,

But Beeson explained a problem that
could present itself for Pitt if Obama’s
proposal of reducing federal support after
tuition increases becomes a reality.

' “By losing federal funds, if tuitionwas
raised it seems that we would be doubly
hurt — first with Commonwealth with-

“drawal of support, and also federal sup-

port,” she said. » - ‘

- Stewart Sutin, a professor of adminis-
trativeand policy study in Pitt’s School of
Education, pointed out that the Obama ad-

ministration is “not acting out of context,

‘ but in a continuum of prior presidents,”

in regard-to the higher—education pro-
posal. Hebelieves that Obama has brought
particular attention to the “affordability,

‘ graduation rates, accountability and ac-

cess” of higher education. But, he said,
it is not the federal government to whom
university communities should be look-

‘ ing for answers. Instead, he suggested

people look to the Pennsylvania state
government.

“The federal government is more of an
advocate and uses the power of the pulpit
to persuade. They have an indirect capac-

' ity to deal with funding issues,’-’ Sutin said.
“State governments have been much more
engaged in educational policy and direct

ofunding for public institutions.”

Tuition rates at Pitt have experienced
persistent increases in recent years as

state funding to the University has. de— ,_

creased or held steady. For the 2011-2012
_year, Gov. Tom "Corbett, newly elected at

the time, proposed a 50 percent cut in I
state funding to the four Pennsylvania .

state-related universities, including Pitt.
Only a 19 percent cut was passed, but the
following year, Corbett again threatened

to reduce Pitt’s appropriation by 30 per—-

cent. _

\ Ultimately, the state held Pitt’s ap-
propriation ﬂat over the past two fiscal
years, maintaining the school’s funding
at the 2o11—2 012 level. Adjusted for inﬂa-
tion, the ﬂat rate roughly equates to the
size of Pitt’s state appropriation in 1986.
According to the University’s Office of
Governmental Relations, the state budget
has increased by more than $17 billion, or
192 percent, since that time.

After learning that funding would re-
main stable for the 2012-2013 school year,
Pitt’s Board of Trustees agreed in the sum-
mer of 2012 not to raise tuition by more
than the 2011 level of inflation, which
was 3.2 percent. Pennsylvania residents
enrolled in the Dietrich School of Arts‘ and
Sciences experienced a tuition increase
from $15,272 to_ $15,730 for the 2012-2013
school year —,— a 3-percent increase.

But despite their efforts to keep tuition
increases low, Pitt administrators stressed
that the challenges facing universities
remain. ‘ ‘ _

“The trick is not to just cut costs, but

to maintain the quality of education while ‘

selectively reducing costs,” Beeson said. _
In regard to Pitt, Sutin praises the Uni-
versity for accomplishing quite a bit in the
past several years to rein in expenses but
noted that, even in trying times, continued
dedication to affordability is crucial.
“All of us in higher education do need to
be conscious of cost affordability and ac-
cess of education for all students,” he said.

National food policies keep us

Rohith Palli
Columnist

On one issue, the ﬁrst lady of
the United States seems to have

A i done far more ‘thanany politi-
- cian. Through her “Let’s Move!”

initiative, Michelle Obama is (of-
ten quite successfully, I hear) at-
tempting to° improve health among
youth and prevent obesity.

One goal of the initiative is to
get kids to exercise more. Stud-
ies suggest that exercise improves
performance at school, in addi-
tion to its more apparent health
beneﬁts. The other major goal of.
Obama’s initiative is to improve
children’s nutrition. A

In aworld where Congress, be-
holden to lobbyists, thinks pizza

sauce should count as a serving of ‘

vegetables, her initiative provides

parents and caregivers with criti— 2

cal nutritional information to help
them make informed food choices.

The initiative has also encour-
aged schools to providehealthier
lunches, a movement that the U.S.
Department of Agriculture backed
with a revision of the school meal

food standards to improve the nu-
tritional quality of meals. ' .
House Republicans thought
changing these standards would
cost too much. Subsequently, to

save money, Congress decided to -

undo many of the USDA’s changes,
banning the department from dis-
favoringtomato paste (read: pizza
sauce) above other vegetables.
While it is true that potatoes and
tomatoes (and maybe pizza) have a
place in school lunches, they must
be incorporated into meals prop-
erly; french-fries and mozzarella
sticks with tomato dipping sauce
are unacceptable, unhealthy al-
ternatives.

In this debate, the question no
one seems to have thought to ask
is: “Why does it cost so much more
to, eat healthy food?” The answer
is farm subsidies. And therein
lies the key to actually achieving
theggoals that the ﬁrst lady has
set forth. '

From 1995 to 2010, the gov-
ernment spent $16.9 billion sub-
sidizingcorn starch, soybean oil,
corn syrup and high—fructose corn
syrup. Compare that with less than

Pedant aiming ?0l§ti

$270 million for apples, the most
heavily subsidized fruit or vegeta-
ble. That’s more than 60 times as
much federal money for additives
than for fresh apples.

This is what leads the average
avocado to cost $1.11 last year
while honey buns currently cost
less than 60 cents each on Ama-
zon.

Across theboard, our farm
subsidies often support the wrong
types of agriculture. In 2011, our
government spent $191,218,926
supporting tobacco growers.
Should we really be subsidizing
the production of cigarettes?

‘Reform of farm subsidies is
critical and should be a biparti-
san endeavor. Liberals get to push
healthy initiatives and take away
incentives for unhealthy habits,
while conservatives get to pare
down government involvement
and leave affairs to the_free mar-
ket. V

However, if cheap, unhealthy

Q&A: Woodallf discusses i NAA tournaen chances

RJ Sepich
Sports Editor

The Pitt men’s basketball team
learned its NCAA'tournament fate
on the evening of March 17 at a Se-
lection Sunday viewing party in the
Petersen Events Center. V

The Pitt News was there and
talked to senior point guard Tray

Woodall about his thoughts on ﬁnd.- r .

ing out Pitt will play Wichita State
University on Thursday afternoon
in Salt Lake City.

The Pitt News: What was your re—
action watching the Selection Show

. and seeing Pitt as a No. 8 seed?

‘Tray Woodall: The brackets
were going up and we knew it was
an 8-9 game — we didn’t think it
was us. Once our name popped up,
everybody was in shock. We were
in shock, and now we’re playing the
[Wichita State] Shockers.
TPN: Does it motivate you that

A your seeding was lower than ex— '

pected?

TW: It’s a game. Seeds don’t even
matter now. All the teams are in
now, and we’re just playing. We’ve
got to" compete.

TPN: You’re going out west to
Salt Lake City. Does it really matter
where you play? »

TW: No, it doesn’t matter. Coach '
[Jamie] Dixon said something about
the altitude and thingsof that na-
ture, but he said it’s all mental.
I never played on that side of the
country in my career, but I’m just
ready to go out there and compete.

TPN: What’s the keyto making
a run deep into the NCAA tourna-
ment? , ' T

TW: Just playing our style of
basketball. We need to make ‘sure
we’re defending and rebounding.
Everyone needs to know their as-
signments, and we need to knock
down free throws when they count.
_ TPN: After losing a couple games
as a higher seed in past NCAA tour-
naments; is it maybe°a good thing to
be seeded a bit lower and be under
the radar with less pressure?

TW: I feel like the pressure still is
on. Some people already say we’re
playing [No. 1 seed] Gonzaga, but we
are not overlooking this ﬁrst game.
We want to win. We want to go out

BARNES BURNER — A V g
Pitt could surprise pessimists and make run 111  Madness

Nate Barnes
‘ ” Senior Szfaﬁ” Wrz'ter

Right now, one has to look at the 68—team
NCAA tournament bracket announced Sunday
and say, “You know, if there’s one region Pitt
could win, it would be the West.” Which, by the
way, is the sub-section of the overall bracket
Pitt was placed in.

Here’s why. . V

Of the four regions (West, South, Midwest,
East), ESPN analyst Jay Bilas called the West
“probably the easiest to navigate.”

First and foremost, Pitt resides in the same
bracket as the lowest—rated No. 1 seed, Gonzaga,
a team the Panthers could face in the second
round. If Pitt gets by N o. 9 seed Wichita State
in the ﬁrst round, it holds a legitimate chance
to upset Gonzaga and advance to the Sweet 16.

Just look at Gonzaga’s regular—season sched-
ule.-Its strength of schedule panned out as No. 75
in the nation, by far the worst of any No. 1 seed.
Then again, Pitt’s was ranked No. 71 because of
the aforementioned glut of games against teams
such as Howard and Duquesne.

Regardless, Pitt would arguably be the best

. team Gonzaga could playall season if the teams
. advance to face each other in the round of 32
on Saturday.

. Beyond that, Pitt’s likely opponents on the
a potential road to the Final Fourpose achallenge,

W * but one that "Pitt could potentially handle.
If Pitt were to make the Final Four out of

 
 

It’s easy to be negative when it comes to sports in
Pittsburgh. When you think about it, it’s slightly
understandable.

This is a city in which the baseball team

 ’ hasn’t had a winning season in 20 years, the .
signature NFL franchise is ﬂoundering, argu-
ably the most important athlete in the city has
been unable to play hockey for roughly a year,
college football has been relegated to a joke
and the college basketball team perennially
struggles in March. .

The seemingly incessant pessimistic atti—
tude that pervades Pittsburgh when it comes
to sports isn’t hard to justify —— even when life
seems pretty good. ' ‘ . T

But it’s easy to be negative. Challenge your—
selves, Pittsburgh. Show some positivity for a '
change.

And start with ‘Pitt basketball.

Yes, the Panthers received a surprisingly low

- No. 8 seed for this yeafs NCAA tournament, but
it’s comprehensible why the selection comrnit—
tee seeded Pitt so low. Basically, it’s the powers
that be telling head coachjamie Dixon to stop
playing the Bethune-Cookmans and Kennesaw
States ‘of the college basketball world and to
startplayingteams that, you know, mostpeople V .
might have at least heard of. Coach Jamie Dixon's Panthers hope to go deep in the NCAA tournament. Pitt plays Wichita

’ But that’s adiscussionfor another time. State in the round of 64 on Thursday afternoon. Zach Schaffer | Senior Staff Photographer ' Barnes 9 9 S M ~

TPN: With two freshman starters injames
Robinson and Steven Adams, what can you tell
them to prepare them for the NCAA tourna-
ment experience? A

TW: It speaks for itself ——. you lose one
game and the season is over. There’s not much
you need to explain. I deﬁnitely think they’re
ready. These young guys, they understand the

concept, they understand what we need to do '

to win. You don’t see that often in younger

. guys.

nament last year? »

but I couldn’t do it.
TPN: What is different from last year’s team

to this year’s team that helped you guys get ~
_ back in the tournament? =

TW: Since day one in the summertime, guys
got to work. We put the work in, and this is the
result: We’re back in the NCAA tournament.

TPN: Knowing that, as a senior, it’s your
ﬁnal chance to make a run at a national cham-
pionship, do you feel any more pressure head-
ing into this week?

TW: No, it’s not too much different. I’m

just happy to be back in the tournament. Last ‘

year was a disappointment. This year we just
wanted to scrap and claw our way back, and
now I’m just glad we’re back in the tournament.

the West, it would, need to beat Wichita State,
Gonzaga (Round of 32) and then probably Wis-
consin (Sweet 16) and Ohio State (Elite Eight).

Compare this to the likely paths Pitt would
need to take as a No. 8 seed in other regions.

East: Temple, Indiana (Round of 32), Syra-
cuse (Sweet 16) and Miami (Elite Eight).

South: Villanova, Kansas, Michigan or Vir-
ginia Commonwealth and Florida or George-
town. ~

Midwest: Missouri, Louisville; St. Louis and
Duke or Michigan State.

In comparison, the ol’ West doesn’t seem
like such a bad place. ,

I’ve come to learn about something called the
“Law of Pitt” during my more than 2 1/2 years

A:

as an undergraduate here at the University. And
‘no, this has nothing to do with Barco. In fact,
I doubt you could ﬁnd a real deﬁnition for it.
Rather, its meaningto me, as someone who’s
seen more Pitt sports in the past three years
than is good for me, is that nothing ever makes
sense when it comes to Pitt’s athletic ventures.

For example, Pitt football lost to Yotmgstown

State and then beat Virginia Tech.

Essentially, defy any logical expectation . h

when it comes to Pitt sports.

Now, Pitt’s not expected to do much of any- ~ 1

thinginthis year’s NCAA tournament, especially
after being handed alower—than-expected seed.

But the “Law of Pitt” calls to me here.

Is this ﬁnally the year for Pitt to return to the
Final Four after a 72-year absence?

Probably not. But you never know when it
comes to Pitt. I
