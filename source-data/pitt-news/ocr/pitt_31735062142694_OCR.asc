U. Of Minnesota All Wet,-A
Kilroy Is Here At Pitt

Mistaken Identity Hinted
In Hero’s Alleged Burial.

The eight-piece brass band that
played for the “funeral” o’f~Kil-
roy, famed war hero, on the Min-
nesota. university campus last
Wednesday evening might just
as well have stayed at home. And
the cortege of pallbearers would
have done better to spend. the day
reading “The Hucksters.” Eoranot
only, is Kilroy very much alive,
but he is right here at Pitt. So
says Grover McCann, business
manager of the 1947 Owl.

McCann believes that the man
who was buried as Kilroy on
the Gopher campus was so thor-
oughly trampled under the heels
of Minnesota coeds that he could
not be identiﬁed. “Student oili-
cials of that university admit that
the mobvictim was so completely
swathed inbandages that only his
eyes were visible,” he insists.

Kilroy, whose name has appear-

ed in every nook and cranny of
the world visited by American

GI’s. is a photographer for the

1947 Owl, according to Jeanne
Mostoller, ‘editor of that publica-

    

tion. Hisfull na~r_n‘e is_Kf11r_9_y1, and

in spite of his fame and achieve-
ments throughout the war, he has
settled down to being.just another
loyal Pitt student.

McCann, however, fearing that
crowds might hamper his re-ad-
justment to civilian life, keeps him
locked in the Owl office.

As part of thecurrent Owl sub-
scription drive Business Manager
~McCann promises that each stu-
dent who buys a 1947 yearbook
will haveas a bonus the oppor-

tunity to shake hands witl_i_ the

   
    

one and only Kilroy!

With some 8,000 day students cramming the Tuck shops,
cafeteria and Oakland restaurants every noon time in an eﬁort
to sustain their bodies for afternoon classes and activities, some
consideration should be given to the problem of eating that
faces every Pitt student. ’

There are not adequate facilities nearby to handle the
hordes of students all wishing to eat at the same time. It is
also a fact that many students carry their lunches, and spend
their lunch time, not in search for food, but for aplace in which
to eat what they already have. .

With this in mind, we suggest that a place. be provided
where those who wish can take their lunches, perhaps buy a
bottleof milk or. a coke, and relax for a few minutes. If this
could be arranged, much of the congestion in the already
overcrowded eating places could be brought to ‘a minimum.

, The Men’s Tuck shop of fourpyears ago is our suggestion
-- in ‘dealing with this problem. Located on the eighth ﬂoor, it
was a- place where only men could eat. Tables were provided,
and a‘ snack bar was set up to serve food on the order that the

ground ﬂoor Tuck shops do, only_on a more limited basis.

 With, the large‘ enrollment of men ‘at Pitt, the return of
the Mens’ Tuck shop, or something similar, is _a vital necessity.
ndividual companies cannot be expected to expand their facili-
ties to take care’ of our need, which is a seasonal one. It is
up to Pitt. ~

Hello again,‘ fellow ale drink-

we noticed a fascinating sign on
the wall of a certain Center Ave-

it smells,‘ we sell it.” There,
friends, is exactly what we’ve
been looking for—a slogan. “If
it smells we wrote it.” (Now all
we have to do is sit back and
wait for contradictions.)

Orchids, scotch and soda, and
congratulations to Coach Wes Fes-

their valiant ﬁght against Purdue.

  Classics Prof. 

Is Versatile

“I speak in English, think in
Latin, and dream in Greek,” says
Dr. Arthur M. Young, new1y-ap-
pointed head of the department of
classics. In- this way" he keeps in
perfect training for his new job
at the University.

Dr. Young, who replaces Dr.

Jotham Johnson as classics head,
was formerly chairman of the

.humanities division at the Uni-

versity of Akron. Before that, he
taught at Washington-Jefferson
college and the University of Vir-
ginia. ‘

Receiving his three degrees at

Harvard, he went abroad to study 0
at the American academy in Rome__

and the American school in Ath-

ens. ’
“When I get settled,” he says,

“I hope to develop some courses

concerning the ﬂowering of the‘

classics in the art and literature,
of later ages.” He explained that
some part of every age is passed,
on to the ages following, and that
much of what was new to the,-
Greeks and Latins is still preserv-
ed in ‘twentieth century arts*be-
cause of this ﬂowering and de-'
velopment of the classics. ’

Dr. Fitzgerald Addresses
Evening Student Assembly

Chancellor Rufus H. Fitzgerald addressed the ﬁrst evening stu-
dents assembly Tuesday evening in the Stephen Foster memorial audi-

6

Terming the Pitt faculty “keen, alert, and up and coming,” Dr.

.. Fitzgerald said, “One reason for this is that we are in the midst
of a going, humming, industrial center—in the midst of ‘a fast
running current which forces the faculty to keep up with latest

trends and developments.”

Acknowledging the spirit of
team play among the faculty and
administrators of the University,
Dr. Fitzgerald said he alone can-

. not carry the administrative load.

’ “It is,”i he said, “the combined
eifort of the deans and other
school heads that makes the Uni-
versity. what it is.”

Emphasizing that the Pitt fac-
ulty members are equally inter-
ested in the evening school and

e the day school, Dr. Frank W.
~-., Shockley, director of the evening
school introduced the deans of the
various schools: Dr. Stanton C.
"Crawford, the College; Dr. Vin-
cent W. Lanfear, the ‘School of
Business Administration; Dr. Ruth
Perkins Kuehn, School of Nursing,
andiDr. S. P. Franklin, School of
Education. Dean Holbrook, School

. of Engineering and Mines, was
9 absent through illness, and Dean
S Longnecker of the Graduate school

was out of town.

Also introduced were Carroll F.
Reynolds, former University li-
brarian, and lately with the his-
torical section, Cor'ps of Engineers,
U.S. Army, and Walter.Crommer,

‘~ ‘ president of the Evening Students“

association. Crommer outlinui the
schedule of evening school activi-
ties which includes three “more as-
sembly programs, Christmas and
Easter chapel services, a Christ-
mas dance, and a spring dinner
dance. Crommer also mentioned
evening school clubs such as the
Glee club, Journalism club, Bowl-
ing club, Dramatics club, and Fly-
ing club. ‘
Activities keys, in tribute to
. their Work as co—edit.ors of the
Evening School Activities hand-
-book, were awarded by Crommer
to Angela Cross, and Angela Ben-
intent. Of a new design, the keys
are-the ﬁrst to- bear a picture of
the Cathedral.

Calhoun NewPrexy

  Of Men’s Glee Club

‘ Men’s glee club elected Robert
Calhoun president and Robert
Mild vice—president at a business
meeting last Wednesday. This ﬁll-
ed two vacancies resulting from
the failure of the two ofﬁcers to

. return to Pitt this fall.

. Conducting the meeting as
chairman was Fred Hassett, sec-
retary, who was elected last June
and continues in office. First he
read the constitution of the or-
ganization, then proceeded with

ofiice include John Riddle, librar-
ian; Benson Altschuler, assistant

Abstract Work
Exhibited B y
Robert Page

The abstract painting on the
ground ﬂoor bulletin board was
recently completed by Bob Page,
YMCA’ student assistant. Bob calls
the painting “JTY,” and is solic-

iting criticisms and comments from __

the student body and faculty.

“The reason for the title, ‘JTY,’
explains Bob, “is that anyone with
a little imagination can envision
the letters J, T, and Y woven in
amidst the white background.”

Bob, a student in the School’ of
Business Administration, has had
no formal training in art, and ad-
mits his technique has come
through practice. He- spends most
of his spare time with a brush and
a jar of paint. -

“The letters JTY flashed to me
like. an inspiration,” Bob stated.
f‘Using these three letters as the

‘*2.

main theme, almost any abstrac-
tion can be evolved from the
shapes of the combined curved
and straight lines.”.

After studying Bob’s work, Ed-
ward Pitz and, Ralph Wilde, also
YMCA student assistants, plan to
try to equal his work, using the
same theme—JTY—-—but with dif-

ferent paints and backgrounds.

The YMCA has proposed a con-

‘test to evalute the three paintings

and any others that are submit-
ted. Judges for the contest are
Lynn Schwer, YMCA oiﬁce secre-
tary, and Sally Beam, student of-
ﬁce asisstant. .‘

Chapel Service Ends
Y Membership Drive

A jointchapel service at 7:30
.p. In. Thursday, planned by Aileen
Jacobs and Herky; Knell, mem-
bership chairmen, will close the
three-day. YM-YW membership
drive. a _ ﬂ

Initiation of new members in-
to the two organizations takes
place at this ‘service.

All Y members are invited to
a ‘ reception honoring the in-
itiates at the Stephen Foster me-
morial after the ceremony.

Left to right, Margie alko, Mrs. Edna Batz, YWCA adviser, and
Aileen Jacobs plan for the celebration in honor of the “Y’s” 35th

anniversary.

Pitt YWCA Founded In 1911,

Celebrates 35th Anniversary

Pitt women are in the habit

of ﬁnishing what they set out to

do. The university branch of ‘the Young Women’s Christian associa-
tion, for example, was launched in 1911 when twenty-ﬁve of Pitt’s
ﬁfty-six women became Y members. Now, as it celebrates its 35th
anniversary,» the YWCA boasts a membership of 400, and is one

of the most active organizations

on the campus.

Mrs. Jean Wood, now with the catalog department of the Uni-

versity library, was president of¢

the ﬁrst group, and Mrs. Helen F.
Dice, librarian‘ in the Alldred
room, was secretary.

In 1911 university students met
daily for chapel, and the YWCA
girls begantheir activities by tak-
ing a prominent part in the serv-
ices.

Everyone brought his lunch
from home in those days, before
the tuck shops and mess hall, so
the Y girls had a ready market
for the candy they sold at the end
of the lunch period. The girls
made the candy themselves _at
Thaw hall where they held their
meetings.

Conditions at the university
have changed since 1911, but the
YWCA has weathered them all
gracefully. -

Mrs. Wood and Mrs. Dice have
watched the Y‘ grow — and they
are proud of what they have seen.

Pitkins’ Initial Meeting‘
Scheduled for Nov. 6

The year’s ﬁrst meeting of the

Pitkin Club is the YWCA birthday
week attraction Wednesday,_ No-
vember 6. The meeting.wil1 be at
6 p. m. at the Shadyside Presby-
terian church. ‘

“The speaker,” according to
Vivian Sensenich,'chairman of the
event, “will be someone you .real—
ly won’t want to miss.” The usual
Pitkin religious discussion will
follow the dinner. ‘‘

Y Association night, when the

been major events to both orga-
nizations. Because this is the P?
thirty-ﬁfth anniversary of the .
YWCA, both groups hope that all
members will help to make this 
a really big affair.

Mary Caroline Daum and Frank-
lin Blackstone, co-chaimen of the
dance, said, “It will be a stag-C
affair, but because of a lack of, .—
space only 250 people will be ad- l_.
mitted to the event-—so. that means 
ﬁrst come, ﬁrst served! Sign up
on Monday or Tuesday in either f
of the Y ofﬁces. But be sure to
hurry, because we want to see you ,1
there!” . ‘

Believing _that no birthday is,
complete without a cake, the
YWCA has decided to have one

Engineers Petition

For Seniority Rights

Priority for upper—classmen during registration and more locker
space on the hill were two requests made by engineering and mine
students in a petition made at a recent joint seminar meeting.

E._A. Holbrook, dean of engineering and mines, presided over
the meeting and agreed to present the suggestions, along with other
desired improvements,‘ to the administration. The other suggestions
are having a coke machine to make up for the lack of conveniently-

located Tuck shop, a smoker, ande

C more chairs in the lounge.

That students who do not at-
tend summer school or any other
current semester will forfeit
their positions in enrollment was
also made known by Dean Hol-
brook. “We feel,” he said, “that
we are in accord with the desire
of veterans who want to ﬁnish
college as soon as possible.”

As faculty advisor to the E
and M association, Professor W.
I. Short explained it would be
impossible to maintain a complete
summer schedule if attendance
was "made optional. “Students
would ﬁnd it difficult to readjust
their schedules after missing a
semester’s work,” he said.

Under ordinary conditions the
school offers limited summer
courses to students who fail or
Who wish to take advanced work.

“The faculty,” Professor Short ad-
ded, “will do their best to main-
tain a complete, year-round
schedule as long as the need ex-
ists.”

ans and present members of the

WSA Plans

New Program

A poetry reading group and
speech forum are the two.- divi-
sions the Women’s Speech asso-
ciation, sponsored by Miss Ruth
Haun of the Speech department,
plans for the 1946-47 program.

The purpose of the reading
group is to represent the cultural
aspects of speech. Centering
around current topics, the forum

is designed to create in college
students an oral interest toward
community and civic affairs.

Charlotte Ginsburg, president of
the association, announced the
following members" of the execu-
tive committee: Pat Maccleary,
vice-president; Doris Bish, secre-
tary-treasurer; Sally Joy Oleon,
WSGA representative; Mae Law-
son, social chairman; Joy Gluck,
poetry reading chairman; Cass
Boyle, public speaking chairman;
Lorraine Bieno, publicity chair-
man; and Ann Monteverde, guild
advisor.

The first poetry reading meeting
is. Thursday, ‘November 7, 2:30

the “Under New Management”
sign will be hung out. But for
this last issue, _may I correct the
impression that some have wrong-
ly gained from the puny attempts
at humor about the contributions
of my‘ accomplice. Fact is, she
does more than I; witness the fact
that her tenure is uninterrupted.
The lucky part for me is the end
of gripes in my ears, but carry
on, Abby!

The Phi Gams will be hunting
two things over this week-end:
pledges and rabbits. The notice
we got said, “Wait ’til you hear
the tall stories,” but about which?
The fellows will be ﬁlled with
extra vigor for Saturday’s trip by

World-shaking events have oc-

election of Herky Knell as presi-

department we hear that Freida
Fogle and Pauline Tisherman will
soon be Mrs’s.

From Tri-Delt hall comes word
about a long weekend for Monnie
Maloney. She survived two days
of formal initiation. Congrats,
sister.

The Phi Mu’s are getting their
invitation in early for an open-
house after the Penn State game.

Tonight will be Hallowe’en, at
least to the Beta _Sigs, at Mary
Vasilaka’s home and new initi-
ate, Jane Cooney will be star

Theta Chi initiated five new men
last Sunday and feted them at
Child’s in compensation for the
“suffering" they endured. Beast-
ies!

Query of the week: Who tripped
the Kappa housemother?

The Phi Eps tell us of the re-
pledging of Bernie Latterman and
Zola K. Gold and adding seven
new men to their already over-
whelming frater roster. _

Phi Kap, too, to be in the style,
heralds seven new initiates and
whispers of a formal sometime
soon.

Charlotte Hamburg has loaned
her back yard tonight to her sis-
ter AEPhi’s——something about a
weiner and “blue—jean” affair.

Some more about the Delta
Zeta’s. The ADPi’s, now wishing
to be called Alpha Delts, will be
host (I guess it’s hostess) to those
now-famous DZ’s. If the tea is
anything like the recent Open

Cap & Gown Club Presents
“Kilroy Is Here”, Dec. 4.»

“Kilroy Is Here” is the ‘tenta-9

tive title selected by the executive
staff of the Cap and Gown for
their December fourth production.
The show is scheduled for a ten
night run from December 4 to De-
cember 14 every night except
Sunday. All performances will be
in the Stephen Foster memorial.

Directing this, the ﬁrst Cap and
Gown show in ﬁve years, is Her-
bert Clark, who has appeared in
several Broadway hits and is now
head of the Student’s Theatre of
the Pittsburgh Drama school.
Clark will be assisted by Lou
Starr, dance director, and Bob
Fitzgerald, student chairman of
the production committee.

The cast for the December pro-
duction is in the process of being
selected, and tryouts are still be-
ing given. The group is badly in
need of dancers according to Wil-
liam Saalbach, faculty advisor to
Cap and Gown. Mr. Saalback says

that experience is not necessary,
only the interest.

Bob Lazar, business manager
of Cap and Gown, is asking for
full student support. Bob believes
that after ﬁve years of inactivity
the organization actually is start-
ing out on a new venture. “We’re
starting from scratch. If the stu-
dent body gives us their full sup-
port next year’s show will be big-
ger. Because of the small amount

we have to depend on the student
body for this support.”

Men interested in Cap and
Gown can keep posted on all de-
velopments by reading the no-
tices on the ground ﬂoor bulletin
board.

The, new Cap and Gown oﬁice
is located in Room 804, the south
conference room in the dean of

men’s oﬂice on the eighth ﬂoor.

The Panther Quits Snorin’

    

Will Soon Start Roarin’

While grizzly bears are searching for nice, warm caves in which
to spend their traditional winter sleep, the Panther, after three years
of hibernation, stretches its paws and returns to the campus.

For those who have never seen a copy of the Panther magazine,

we have devised a little quiz game that will give full details. We’ll'
ask the questions, and we’ll give the answers.
A

November 1, 1946.)
Q.—Exactly what
Panther?
A.—The Panther
was a

is the Pitt

formerly

monthly magazine,

written and published by Pitt
students. This year, however,
it will be published only

three times,
March, and May.

Q.-—What kind of material ap-

pears in the Panther?

in December,

A.-—-Because it is written by
students, only material of in-
terest to the students appears:
short stories, campus news,
features, editorials, jokes, car-
toons, and pictures. It will be
a big edition-——from 24 to 32

pages.
Q.—It

isn’t one of these col-

lege-humor publications, is it?
A.—Not on your life. In

1941 the Panther ceased its em-

phasis on jokes, and fashion-
ed itself after Time and Life.

(Patent refused,

Q.—Sounds good--huh?

A.—It was good. It was the
finest college magazine in the 
Country, according to the op-
inion of the Associated Colle-
giate Press convention, which
met in November, 1941. Of V
the 500 colleges and univer-
sity publications analyfzgd, the
Panther came out on top as the
most advanced and distinctive.
Q.—-Can anybody contribute to

the Panther?

A.--Yes. Pitt students are‘
asked to take material they.
have written to the 8th ﬂoor
Panther olﬁce.

Q.——Uh . . . how much does the
Panther cost?

A.—It used to cost a quar-
ter. The price this year hasn’t
been announced yet.

In any event, stand back! The
Panther has been snorin’——now it’s

ready to start roarin’.

Tackles Lead ‘Lincplay

by Bob DeLotto

“A team is just as rugged as
its tackles,” is a ﬁgure of speech
that has long been established
throughout football ranks, and
this year it certainly has held true
to make the Pitt Panthers a strong
defensive eleven.

The Panthers have four sets ex-
perienced tackles who have played
havoc all year with hostile ball
‘~'= ‘ ' ‘ 6  " ~ carriers. Lead-
ing this spirit-
ed crew is big
Jack Durishan,
a senior from
Hazelton, play-
ing his third
year for the
Jungle C ats.
Jack has ap-
plied all his
football senses
to his 220 lbs. to be one of the
leading pillars to Pitt’s front wall.

Holding down the other start-
ing tackle slot, for the biggest part
of the year, has been freshman
Bob Plotz. Although not a giant
in structure, Plotz displays a lot
of ﬁght which makes him almosgt
indispensible in the lineup.

WithpPlotz suﬁering from early
season injuries, Marty Rosepink

”l)ur1shan

V

and Mike Roussos, two Pitt vet-
erans, have seen much action.
Rosepink played on the Panther
squad prior to his entrance into
the armed ‘forces, while Roussos
played for the Panthers last sea-
son at fullback. Both of the boys
are big and their rugged play
adds considerably to the Panthers’
never-say—die attitude.

The largest of Pitt’s tackles is -

freshman Morris Harris, who tips
the Toledos at 260. Another fresh-
man from which much is expected
in the future is Bill Hardesty, a
220 lb, candidate who prepped at
Langley High School. “Wib’ For-
sythe and Dan Cerrone are two
other seasoned hands that have
played a big part in the strong
defensive set-up at the Oakland
Oval.

Following the Notre Dame
clash, it was- announced that
George “Buck” Johnson, a 240

lb. veteran would be lost for the
remainder of the season.‘ John-

son, a powerfully. built 6-4 ath-
lete, was rapidly ﬁtting himself
into the Panther tackle setup and
his loss has been keenly felt. Al-
so out of the lineup for the entire
campaign is tackle Jim McDon-

Penn State has many of its old
pre-war stars back on the team
and they are eager to put State
back in ‘its former position as, one
of the best cross-country squads

- in the East.

Gerald Karver, the number one
man on the Lion squad, will
probably have a busy afternoon
trying to defeat the Pitt ace, Ed
Sudzina. This promises to be an-
other one of those thrilling two
man races. Sudzina has ﬁnished
so far out in front in all of his

races this season that it is hard to

predict the possibilities of the
Duquesne, Pa. star.

The Pitt-Carnegie Tech cross-
country meet on Wednesday after-
noon turned out to be a’thrilling
contests The Panther speedsters
managed to defeat the Tech run-
ners by the slim margin of three
points, winning 26-29.

The , expected duel between

According to Coach Dr. H. C.
Carlson and assistant Bobby Art-
man, prospects for the coming
year are very good, but other
colleges will also be loaded with
talent. The Pitt squad has been
strengthened considerably by the
return of quite a few veterans
from past teams.

J orgenson, ‘ a transferee from~

Ohio State, will undoubtedly be
one of the leading factors on this
year’s squad . -He ranges well

man, at. 6 ft. 5 in. Black and Jelly

During _the past week, several

Intercollegiate Tourney
A national contest sponsored by

the Intercollege Bridge Tourna-
ment committee is being planned.

The preliminary round will be
played by mail, with two teams
being selected from each zone to
play in Chicago. Expenses to the
ﬁnals in April, 1947 will be paid
by the committee.

Invitations to enter a two—player
varsity, which may be selected by
any means the universities choose.
have been mailed. The country
has been divided into eight zones
with 300 competing teams.

Contrary to most intercollegiate
sports, men and women can com-
pete on equal grounds in a bridge
tournament. The first event was
won by Radcliffe in 1940, while
Cornell won the 1946 ﬁnals.
