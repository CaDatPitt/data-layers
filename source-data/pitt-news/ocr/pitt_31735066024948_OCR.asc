An internal investigation by the University

athletes to -entertaining students with free

According to the in-house report sent to
the NCAA, between 1986 and January

1991 the Pitt football program violated‘

rules regarding recruitment of prospective
students and providing extra" benefits to
student-athletes.

All of the allegations took place during.

the tenure of former Pitt head football
coach Mike Gottfried.

The investigation account also disclosed
nine other possible offenses, including
former coaches giving money to student-
athletes and giving “host money” to
student-athletes.assigned to host
prospective students during recruiting
trips.

Pitt Chancellor J. Dennis O’Connor,
along with Director of Athletics Oval Jaynes,
acknowledged the improprieties at a
press conference Monday afternoon
and said that such behavior would
not be tolerated under his leader--
ship.

  

“It is clear that certain violations of
established rules have occurred,” O’Connor
said.“We have conducted a thorough
investigation and have‘ already
implemented significant corrective actions

' to ensure that such violations should not

occur again. A y
“We plan to cooperate fully with the
NCAA,” O’Connor said.

The violations mentioned in the

university's investigative report of the’

program during the 1986 to January 1991
time span include: ' ’
-. Providing three prospective student-
athletes with money for expenses for

Though many believe that
weight gain occurs after the
cessation of smoking and
therefore causes people to
relapse and start smoking again,
research suggests this is not true,
Dr. Kenneth Perkins of
Western Psychiatric Institute
and Clinic said at a lecture
Friday.

Research on the effects of
nicotine on the amount of food a
person eats showed that smokers
become immune to nicotine’s
anorexic effect.

In fact, there, is only a six to
seven pound difference between
non-smokers and smokers,
according to Perkins.

Perkins said the weight gain
most smokers experience when
they quit is just temporary.
According to him, the smoker’s

quitting smoking does

weight levels off naturally at
what it would have been if
the person had never
smoked.

“Their weight is being art-
ificially suppressed while
smoking. [Once smokers quit] it
brings them back to where their
weight should be,” Perkins
said.

Over 100,000 people die daily
from smoking, according to
Perkins.

By Heather Gahres
Asst. News Editor

The selling of the Western—

Psychiatric Institute and Clinic: to
Presby has forced workers at
WPIC to fight to keep their newly
signed contract, members of the
Service Employees International
Union said. J _ .
Less than four months ago,
membersgof the WPIC’s chapter
of SEIU signed a three year
contract. Now due to the selling
of WPIC, management is

jdemanding a new contract

according to union members.

“We’re confused andupset. We
spent up to three months
negotiating this contract in good
faith. [WPIC] has known for one
year that they were going to
merge,” chapter president of SEIU ,
Deb Simon said.

Representatives of Presby were
unavailable for comment.

The management of Presby has
given the union a set of proposed
ammendments to their current
contract. The most severe are
sick leave and bereavement, the
district secretary ‘and treasurer of
the SEIU, Tom DeBruin said.

Some of the proposed changes
include reducing sick leave from
12 to ﬁve days, and employees
would no longer be able to
accumulate their sick leave.
Presby would also reduce the
-number of days an employee is
excused from work due to the

“The weight gain is going to
go up [after they quit smoking],
but it is all trivial as compared to
the benefits of stopping smoking.
They’re much better off from
a medical» st-andpoint,” he
said.

Perkins said that weight gain
does not promote relapse.

The harder people try to avoid
gaining weight once they have
stopped smoking, the more likely
it is that they will relapse and

Simon. said that had the
administration been upfront about
the merger, the union would have
been able to negotiate the

"proposed ammendments to their

contract, during their original
contract negotiations.

Though most issues could be
negotiated, there are a couple
issues that are very critical, such
as sick leave, DeBruin said.

“The position of Presby has
been take it or leave it byJune 21
or they’re just going to stop
recognizing our contract and the
union.... That kind of arrogance
is - outrageous. To negotiate. in
good faith is one thing but to just
threaten us to take it or leave it,
people feel this is just a slap in the
face,” he said.

Organizer for the union, Marty
Cohen said that this is not just a
matter of Presby continuing their
contract. “Presby is deathly in
fear of u nions. They can meet the
benefit demands if they wanted
to, but then [current employees

Women debate sexism in

By Jason Hillman
Managing Editor

When looking at the Orthodox
perspective ofJudaism, it is sexist
against women, Pitt sociology
Professor Dr. Lynn Davidman said
at a panel lecture discussing
feminism in Judaism Monday.

“The Judaism that relies on the
set of laws developed by the
rabbis,  is sexist.”

In order to understand whether
or not Judaism is sexist, it has to
be understood that there are
various forms ofJudaisrn and that
there needs to be a definition of
sexism, Davidman said.

By her definition, sexism is a
set of ideas that seek to limit the
roles women can play in society.

“I am a strong, committedJew.
I’m not Orthodox, but being
Jewish is a central part of my life.
All my research is on Jews. I
breathe Judaism and I’m a strong
feminist. So right away you know
those two are not contradictory
in my life,” Davidman said.

“Women's, perspectives are
absent,” she”sai’d." 7

The main reasons why rabbinic
Judaism is sexist‘are that rabbinic
laws were designed by men with
no say from women and because
the primary role of women in
rabbini'cJudaism is in the home,
according to Davidman.

“I feel that as long as there is a
system oflaws that are written by
men, that women have no say in
changing, that women have a
long way to go in Judaism,”
Davidman said.

Other branches have arisen in
the past two centuries that have
actively attempted to change
women’s role in the religion, she
said. '

‘‘I struggle to bring myJudaism
to my feminist community, and I
struggle to bring my feminism to
my Jewish community. And I
think it’s a lifelong struggle,” she
said

I)avidman touched on the
question of feminism and anti-
semitism. She said it is hard to
define feminism.

“Certainly ifyou take a room of
'l() feminists, you could come up

' with ll definitions of feminism,”-55~»

she‘s'aid.. ' A

Many feminists ‘believe that
Judaismis to blame for the lack of
power that women have in
society, because during the time
of the birth of Judaism goddess
worship was very popular, and
there is a perception that theJews
suppressed it, Davidman said.

“That is a dangerous strand in
feminism that blamesJews for the
death of the goddess and that
says if the Jews hadn’t come
along, everything would have
been a whole lot better,” she said.

Rebbitzen (meaning wife of a
Rabbi) Rivvy Poupko Kletenik
said she was a part of traditional
Judaism, and admitted that men
are in charge of Orthodox Jewish
synagogues. ,

“Traditional Judaism feels that
Judaism is not the synagogue.
What goes on in our synagogue
and the role it has come to play in
the 20th century is a historical
aberration,” Kletenik said.

The synagogue is not the center
of Judaism, the family and home
are the nucleus of the religion
a.ndrfcu1tusre» .sh€.x$aid- A

Judaism

The reason men dominate
synagogues is “the notion that
_ the honor of a Jewish woman is
' inward. In that the role designed
for the woman is private and the
one of the male is a more of a
public role,” Kletenik said.

She said there is a notion in
Judaism that women are more
spiritual than men.

“A man is traditionally more
business/hunting oriented and
therefore they must
disciplined and told, ‘You’ve got
to encourage yourspirituality.’ If
ourJewish men hadn’t been told,
‘You get you rself to lsynagoguel,’
they wouldn’t. In fact, if you go

to temples where women have

been given the right to pray,
you’ll find a lot of women, and
the men are on the golf course,”
Kletenik said
Rabbi Sharyn Henry spoke of
a need for Jews to discover the
missing part of their history.
“Jewish tradition,.as we know
it, has been interpreted,
developed and monitored by
men,” I-Ienry said. “I know a lot

Prof receives Fem.’ grant

./~ By Christine Hanna
News Assistant ‘

Assistant Professor Carmen Rabell of Pitt's Hispanic «
department received a $33,000 grant from the Ford
Foundation's Post-Doctoral Fellowship.

The award, given by the National Research Council, will
allow Rabell to conduct research at Ohio State University and
complete her book, Forensic Discourse and the Spanish Novella
of the Golden Age.

“What I am researching on is how the Spanish use legal
discourse to be able to pass censorship,” Rabell said.

Rabell said that the book will be approximately 200 pages
long and it will be her first book in linglish.

“I think the research will take from six to eight months, and
I will write the book in four to five months. Of course I will
need an extra year of rewriting and editing," she said.

Rabell recently visited Spain and Portugal to gather material
for her project proposal. 1

“I was looking for some poetics. Also, I produced a
bibliography on Spanish law,” she ‘said.

She said she is going to Ohio State because it has an
excellent collection of sixteenth- and seventeenth— century
novellas. Ohio State history and culture Professor of Spanish
Vicente Cantarino will be assisting Rabell with her book.

and independence.”

The 1990 Americans with a
Disability Act makes it illegal to
discriminate against people on
the basis of disability, but the law
cannot rid the public of attitudes
reinforced by the media that some
“suffer from MS instead of have
MS,” Brady said.

People with a disability are
regarded as “second—class
citizens,” he said. Students and
faculty with a disability must enter
through the back door to get into
some Pitt buildings, Student
Service Specialist Sabina Bilder
said.

Although the 1975 Rehabilitation
Act required all federally~funded
institutions to provide handicap-
access to all facilities, the Pitt

music and mineral industry_

buildings and the second floor of
the Cathedral have no access for

people with disabilities‘.

However if a student with
disabilities wants to take a class
offered in one of the inaccessible
locations, the class will be moved
to another site.

Subject to the tougher ADA,
the new residence hall,
Sutherland, will have complete
handicap access. Pitt buildings
constructed before the ADA don’t
have to provide handicap access
until they undergo renovations,
Bilder said.Pitt Chancellor J.
Dennis O’Connor, a cabinet
member of the coordinating
directors for the campaign, did
not attend the kickoff and was
not available for comment.

Pittsburgh Plate Glass Vice
President Tom Horgan said PPC
hopes “to lead by example to get
others to invite people with
disability to the full table this
society sets.”

PPG currently employs 700
workers with disabilities.

As far as any negative
repercussions to the investigation
involving the current football
squad, recruiting coordinator Larry
Petroff said the focus should be

-directed “towards the future, and

not in the past.”

“Everything that occurred [in
inquiry! was in the
past,” Petroff said. “None ofthe
coaches on the current staff
were here when violations took -
place." A

Petroff said that though the
threat of penalty for past actions
hangs over the program, he
and the rest of Panther head coach

Paul llackett’s staff] prefer to
stress 1992 and beyond and not
worry about something they
cannot control, namely
punishment.

“[Punishmentsl are bridges that
we'll cross when we get there.
We can’t worry about that,” he
said.

l-lackett was out of town and
could not be reached for
comment. .

Any ruling or action taken by
the NCAA will not take place for

Jones noted the severity of the
allegations, thoroughness of the

factors in determining exactly
when and what type of penalty,
if any, would be handed

“The fact that [Pitt] initiated the

positive,” Jones said. “But if
you’ve got serious violations,
it doesn’t matter who reports
them.”

the severity ofthe Pitt infractions

focused’on allegations that
surfaced in the university’s initial
inquiry on the football program
in 1989.

Following a number of
newspaper articles concerning
these allegations in February
1991, the investigation was
reopened.

Over 100 witnesses in 10 states
participated in the proceeding,
including current and former

former members of the
Pitt coaching staff and
administration and parents of
student—athletes.

The report also stated that three
former members of the

allegations refused to be

Cohen said that the dispute
is a matter of the idea of
unionism. “If you stand for
what management wants to
give you, then you’re not a
union. If you give up today
benefits for the workers ol"
tomorrow, then you’re not a
union,” Cohen said.

Simon agreed that the
dispute was more than just a
matter of money. “linions are
a sense of unity, wanting to
stand our ground because we
have to,” Simon said.

The installation of University of Pittsburgh Chancellor
J. Dennis O’Connor inspired the Pitt community by
showing the importance of our institution of higher
learning. Universities play a significant role in contributing
to the arts, sciences and humanities in their communities.

However college athletic programs have‘ forced
universities to rc—examine institution goals. Continuing
allegations of improper actions by college athletic
departments throughout the United States are at the root
of this re-examination.

On Monday, Pitt released its own findings from an
investigation into National Collegiate Athletic Association
allegations of violations by the Pitt football program
between 1986 and 1991. The investigation revealed that
the program funded three prospective students’ visits to
campus under the tenure of former Pitt football head
coach Mike Gottfried. Also called into question were
purchases of food and clothing, limousine services,
entertainment and luxury hotel stays which indicate
violations of rules set forth by the NCAA.

In response to the in—house report, ()’Connor noted, “It
is clear that certain violations of established rules have

occurred. We have conducted a thorough investigation-

and have already implemented significant corrective
actions to ensure that such violations should not occur
again.” ‘

O’Connor’s assurance of action is important to retain
the integrity of the athletic program.

Yet further investigation through an independent source,
such as the NCAA, must occur in order to provide an
outsiderls view. While the Pitt report uncovered 12
infractions, an outsider’s account could provide additional
objectivity. An outsider investigation would only lend

credibility to Pitt’s internal findings or address skepticism .
"about whether"othe‘r‘ v’io'l'a‘ti’ons w'é‘at unrecorded.

While the new administration cannot be personally
liable for the actions of the former, the university cannot
shrug off responsibility for the actions of Gottfried and
previous athletic director Ed Bozick. Liability is not with
the individual but with the institution. Action by the
NCAA could entail sanctions. Pitt could impose penalties
on itself. Some punitive action should occur. If no action
occurs, accused individuals’ departure from the institution
would guarantee that NCAA violations are taken seriously.

For students, the internal investigation findings are not .
surprising. Universities,give;.students,s;pe.cial privileges .
basednot on perforrriance but on what program they

happen to enter. Certain students are valued more than
others, and academic pursuits are not always the measuring
criteria. With the push of mass marketing and media,
university heads have become partners with the National

Football League, turning college football programs into‘ .4

farm leagues for professionalfootball.

Rodney King is the Willie Horton that whitepeople
fear will hurt them. Horton, a convict, committed
a murder while out on an early-release program in
Massachusetts. President Bush used Horton in
campaign ads to portray Michael Dukakis as being
soft on criminals. .

In Simi Valley, a non-black jury found four
officers not guilty of excessive force when they
beat Rodney King 56 times on April 30.‘ Perhaps the
jurors felt safer knowing that the police were
willing to go to such violent lengths to protect good
citizens.Unfortunately, Rodney King didn’t get the

apologized for the beating but quickly added “in
spite of the fact that lhe’sl on parole and a

to be revoked for those who step out of line.
Rodney King ‘stepped out of line by being a
scared, drunk ex-con who behaved erratically. The

,. '21 armed policemen who surrounded him were
afraid of him.,;Fear and erratic be_havior are no

justification for zapping a man with 50,000 volts of
electricity and beating him 56 times in 81 seconds.
Rodney King deserved the same protection under
the law that is guaranteed to all.

One of the jurors claimed that the beating wasn't
a racial incident because King’s two black
companions complied with the police and weren't
beaten. ‘ ,

However, Bryant Allen, one of the two
companions, told investigators that he was kicked

evidence was -not_ pursued by : the prosecution
during the trial. Even when a black man complies

After the beating, L.A. residents demanded police

Race is a complex issue in the beating, the riot
and the legal system. L.A.’s ethnic groups are

the edge of despair. However there are sections of
Pittsburgh where people are struggling to survive

similar gangs to form here. Pittsburgh and the

college community cannot stick their heads in the 

sand and say, “It won’t happen here.”

The rising crime on campus‘ indicates a need for
clear communication between Pitt student groups
and the campus police. Student groups have
demanded improved services, even though the
security budget has decreased for three years.
Services cannot be improved without funding. The
student government could continue to work with
campus security to demand budget increases which
would enable the campus police to better protect
students.

Around the country, students are discussing the
riots, racial issues and the use of excessive force.
The riots give students a unique opportunity to
explore feelings and thoughts about the racism
which is inherent both in daily life and in the legal
system. By addressing racism at a personal level,
students can try to make some sense of this

Love is the rok in   blic's adaptation of A Moon)

By Brian Berger

Showcase Editor

For a playwright who was disregarded
until his death and only recently, but
hesitantly, acclaimed for his work, Eugene
O’Neill was ahead of his time.

His last complete play, A Moon For The
Misbegotten, is revived at the Pittsburgh

Public Theater until May 51. It is entrenched ‘
in social ideologies as prevalent today as,

in the time of O’Neill’s semi-
autobiographical play (1925). In genre
terms, A Moon is a clever dramedy (with

tragic overtones), a trendy term stamped _
s on tele_Vision shows (Moonlighting) and

offerings on the big screen which fits right-
at home with this play. From petty capitalist
scheming reminiscent of today’s corporate
and government frauds to the strong
female character who yearns for love and
respect a la today’s more self-reliant

femmes, A Moon is a small Connecticut .

farm of the ’20s with all the implications
and responsibilities of contemporary urban
culture. I
At the core of the play is Josie Hogan
(Caryn West), a “cow” of a woman with a
busty chest and a heart as big and deep.
Josie is the daughter of the harsh and
unnerving Phil (Larry John Meyers), a
jaded figure who cares more for his pigs
and drink than his sons, who have all left
home in defiance of his totalitarian tactics.
Thus, Josie’s world has been stained and
colored with cheap thrills, one—night-stands
with locals — a true “farmer’s daughter”
— and hard work as caretaker of the
Hogan farm, more a plot of land than a
productive agricultural outlet. '
Landowner, lover and lush James
Tyrone, Jr. (Tom Atkins) visits the Hogans
and announces that T. Stedman Harder
(Michael Burns) is interested in the Hogan’s
stake of the farm and that the price is right.
Tyrone has given his word that he won’t
sell to anyone but Phil, and what ensues
is a tormented struggle of souls on the
outer edges with property as the catalyst
and the discovery of lonely spirits coming
together as its earmarks. '
O’Neill originally -wrote Tyrone’s
character as a personal interpretation of
his wicked brother, Jamie. The play and

character are sequels to A Long Day’s'
journey Into Night, one of O’Neill’s .four.......

Pulitzer Prize winners (his time ‘did
deservedly come).
He was never satisfied with the stage

representation and swore never to see or -

lend a hand to any productions of A Moon,
all of which bombed until Broadway’s
1973 adaptation thrust the play as a major
work of American theater.

He complained _that Tyrone was not
played with enough “gentlemanliness,”

the essence of which Atkins also fails to ,

capture. In fairness, the character is a

polite alcoholic with a lady's touch and at 
manic soul. His sins have given him a

detached spirit, one that begs for mercy
and feeling. Atkins conveys the images in

a solid fashion, yet his non-abrasive style

feeds more into the later stages of the play',’‘'

which are ﬁlled with agonizing, descriptive
rhetoric of the loss of his mother and his
soul’s worthlessness, than into the earlier,
more comic moments which ring with the
classic O’Neill back-and-forth vernacular
of insult and cut.

Meyers is brilliant as the scheming Phil
Hogan. His Irish accent and decor drive
his beaten—but—not—down character, one
which lacks sympathy but captures respect.
As a local-scene veteran, Meyers (director
of City Theater’s Bricklayers, star of PPT’s

_.Three Sisters and others) nearly‘ steals the

those who wish to attempt to
discover these clairvoyant
prospects, may I suggest-delving
irito. the sights and sou nds offered
by a few bands for a cognizance
striptease. Two cranium-inspiring
shows in one hot summer week
will hopefully make you think
and participate asthe critically-
minded and able-bodied hip-
heads that you aspire to be.

For starters, Pussy _Galore—

spawned experimentJon Spencer '
Blues Explosion will lay waste at .-

the Oakland Beehive on
Thursday. For interested parties,
the band recorded troisefforts on

‘trots different labels and released _

them at around the same time. It
sounds like some consumerism
plot, and it doesn’t help that some
songs are duplicated on the Crypt,
Caroline and Siltbreeze releases.

,-Aside from the-apparent‘ tugs at

m’purse,strings, the JSBE sound

guarantees to rip the lard

outta anyone who gets smart with
‘em. '

In a minute-long history lesson
of the blues, one realizes that the
musical form is the heartfelt,

‘painful sort, the kind you cry and

write coz yer baby left you so

others can listen and weep at ,

your misfortune. The heart’s there;
the soul’s there. For JSBE, the
pain and melancholia transcend
the typicalland enter the realm of

conscious aching._ The blues here -

is a deep and brooding languor
coupled with crippled hysteria. '

-This neurosis can easily be
traced to Spencer’s roots in Pussy
Galore. JSBE’s short and gutteral
stabs are sliced with the same
blade as PG’s_ noise and scum
days. Just as PG banged and
howled, JSBE» takes, the binge-
purge mentality and adds bluesy
guitar undercurrents, tenor and
baritone saxophone cries and a

I lone, bursting trumpet. The effect
is. an ‘off—tempo' whrirlwirid of...
and bashes "and~

crashes
something reminiscent of "the 1-
4-5 blues progression. '

If that’s not enough to setyer
pants ablaze, let it be known that
not only do these guys know
Kramer and Albini, these two
gurus of rock produced all three
records. '

Baseball finishes season with improved 25-22 record  l

By Tom Schneider
‘Staff Writer

The Pitt baseball team wrapped
up its season this past week by
defeating Duquesne and splitting
a two—game set with Akron
University.

After taking two of three games
from Big East rival Villanova, the
Panthers thrashed the reeling
Dukes last Thursday at Trees

Field, scoring an 11-5 victory

despite committing three
errors.
After taking an early 2-0 lead,
the Panthers saw thatlead quickly
disappear when the Dukes came
alive to score three runs in the
bottom of the third and then two
more in the fourt-h, jumping to a
5-2 advantage.
These were all the runs they
would score that afternoon
however, and it was not enough

to hold off the stirging Panthers.

~ Pitt stormed back for four runs in

the sixth and two in the seventh,
then tacked on three more runs
to finish off their crosstown
rivals.

The Panthers hosted Akron

University on Friday for the first
game of a home—and-home two
game series with the Akron
Zips.

The first game was a hard-
fought battle finally settled by a
bases—loaded walk for shortstop
Ralph McNelly in the bottom of
the 10th inning which gave the
Panthers the win, 7-6. The
difference in this game was four
costly errors by Akron players
which led to Panther runs late in
the game. ,

With the victory, Pitt pitcher
Jason Rakers picked up his fourth
win of the season.

The two teams then moved to

Akron on Sunday for the ﬁnal’

game of the series. The
showdown was a virtual
smorgasbord of offensive power,
as Pitt and Akron combined for
27 runs and 31 hits during the
contest. ’
The upper hand would belong
to the Zips however, as the Akron
bats exploded for five runs in
both the fourth and seventh
innings. .
_ They also scattered six more
runs, outslugging Pitt 16~11 and

giving Panther hurler Rob
Hanwalt his sixth loss of the
season.

“We had a 9-8 lead going into
the bottom of the seventh in
Akron, and then we just kind of
fell apart. The pitching didn’t do
very well in that game, but the
hitting during our last three
[games] was very good. I think
we did very well in our last few
games, and I feel very good about
the performance this season,”
head baseball coach MarkJackson
said.

The Panthers finished the 1992
season with a record of 2522, a
vast improvement from their 15-
30 record of last year.

The team’s 5-13 conference
record was not good enough to
earn a berth in the Big East
tournament, which takes only
the top four teams.

Standout Big East performers
this year include pitcher Bill
Junker, Jr., who was named Big
East Pitcher of the Week for the
week of April 6, and shortstop
Josh Tyler, who was named Big
East Player of the Week for the
same time period.

Steelers go

 

By Ryan Buncher , . .
Asst. Sports Editor

One  two  three  four 
pardon me. I was trying to count how
many times I wrote that the Steelers
should take Tennessee wide receiver Carl
Pickens in the first round of the NFL draft.
I lost count.

I really think this guy is ‘going to be a

great pro and would have been the perfect
choice for the Steelers. Of course, taking
the fact that nobody listens to me as a
given, they drafted Miami offensive
lineman Leon Searcy. .

I also had hopes that Stanford ful-lback ,
Tommy Vardell, a borderline first—rounder.

until moving up the last week before the
draft, or Michigan offensive tackle Greg
Skrepenak would be there for Pittsburgh
in round two —— no such luck. The Steelers

wanted Penn State. linebacker Ma»rk,,,'
D’Onofrio, but he was gone, too. ,Clemsori;.,.
linebacker Levon Kirkland was a pretty ’

good consolation prize;

You may guess that I was less than

thrilled with the Steeler draft at first,
thinking they could have done better.
After closer inspection the only choice I
still don’t like was spending a fourth-
round pick on Charles Davenport instead
of Florida State quarterback Casey Weldon.

Actually, the more I look at this draft the
more I like it, The Steelers went for
producers instead ofjust guys with
potential and came up with a group that
could make a major contribution to the
team immediately.

The offensive line was a real problem
last season, and it is improved. New
offensive coordinator Ron Earhart favors
a huge line, and the team took some major
steps in giving him one. Plan B pick—up
Duval l.ove‘fills a major hole at the left
guard spot, but the draft could be a key for
years to come. . ’

Searcy is a gem. He could step right in
at right tackle after facing top competition
in college.

“He already played for a pro team for
four years,” according to my colleague

Oh, ’

for productive playerset

Brian Gallagher.
In addition, eighth-round pick Hehsam
Ismail, a guard from Florida, is a

power-blocking style and could eventually
help. Pittsburg State guard Kendall
Gammon (11th round) fills the team’s
needfor a long snapper. ‘

A running back was a concern for the
team, with Tim Worley suspended for _’92

and questions about Barry“Foster’s attitude‘

waiting to be answered. Concerns were
enough that many thought the team would
‘take Indiana tailback Vaughn Dunbar in
the first round, but Earhart’s offense with
the Giants would seem to indicate that a
quality line is the first priority for a good
running attack, so it makes sense for the
Steelers to want to settle things up front
first.
a They did getsome help in the backﬁeld.
l"ul~lback Scottie Graham was banged up
liisjunior and senior seasons but showed

yards rushing and 10 touchdowns as a
sophomore. At the very least he can
provide a solid backup for Merril Hoge.
Hjalfback Mike Saunders, who was taken
in the IOth round, could be another late-
round ﬁnd like Hoge and left tackle John
Jackson (both 10th-rounders) among
others. He is a quality runner who
produced against strong competition in
the Big Ten. He is also a good enough
receiver that he was moved to wide
receiver for part of his stay at Iowa.
Saunders could beat out Leroy Thompson
for the ﬁfth running back spot.
Davenport has a very good shot to stick
as a receiver. Head coach ,Bill Cowher
hinted that Davenport, who converted
from quarterback to receiver his junior
year at N.C. State, could also be Pittsburgh’s
third—string quarterback. If they wanted
that, maybe they should have gone after
former Pitt receiver and quarterback
Darnell Dickerson as a free agent. As long
as he doesn’t have to go to classes, there
should be no problem. Seventh-round
pick Russ Campbell, a ‘tight end from
Kansas State, is most likely the team’s

lieifcouhld be a quality runner with 977’

third tight end.

The major areas of need for defense’ 
were size on the front,,li_ne and an-inside--A  ' .

The Steelers drafted two defensive backs
who have a very real shot at the roster.
Michiganstate cornerback Alan Haller is a
good athlete but lacks ‘great coverage
skills. He might help as a nickle back. Penn
State safety Darren Perry is the perfect
example of the new Steeler philosophy.
He is not a guy who impresses you when

The common factor here is productive
football players. Almost all of the picks
have very good chances of making the
team, and Searcy, Kirkland and Steed have

Despite the cancellation oflast Saturday’s Pitt invitational Track
and Field Meet and the absence of men’s track head coach John
Vasvary, who underwent emergency heart surgery last week, the
men’s track and field team competed at the 24th Annual Penn
State Open at University Park last Sunday. .\‘one of Pitt’s athletes
who participated in this meet ﬁnished with qualifying times.

With Vasvary’s current illness, women’s head coach and men’s
sprint and hurdles coach Steve Lewis has taken over as the
primary coach for the the men’s team.

At Penn State, Pitt senior Tom Swartout finished fifth in the
SO00-meter event. He posted a time of l/1.65.2 seconds, 15
seconds behind winner Aidan O’ Reilly of Penn State (l/t:/+5.7).

l’itt’s women’s track team also competed this past weekend at
the ;\larauder Invitational, which took place at Central State
t,'ni\ersity in \\"ilberforce, Ohio. "We tried to get lmorel people
to qualify,” Lewis said of his strategy forthe meet.

.\'< ibody became an l-Eastern College Athletic (jot iference (_lrICAC)
qualifier at that meet however. At (jentra.I State, Pitt did not use
such standout performers as junior Carmela ;\~’lariani and senior
Stacey \\£r’y'/.ykowski, both distance runnt,-rs, and multi—event
performer Stacy Roth, a first—year student. These three are already
l:ICAC qualifiers. ’

The highlight for Pitt at this competition was the performance’

of junior Joanne Warner. She is a two—timt.- lsig liast champion,
won both the discus and javelin events on her way to receiving
most outstanding field performer honors for the meet.

supposedly about to acquire wide
receiver Shawn Collins from
Atlanta as a sixth-rounder. The
Steelers should keep trying to get
this guy. Collins was provirig to
be a top—notch receiver before
getting lost in the Falcons’ Red
Gun offense last season.

Plan I3 was extremely important
to Atlanta, getting wide—outs Drew
Hill and Tony Jones from the
Oilers. Add them to All-Pro Andre

sive line.First-rounder Tony Smith
and eighth—rounder Derek Moore
should help in the backfield.

It seems I am alone in thinking
the Redskins screwed up trading
two first—round picks (6 and 28)
for the number—four pick to get
Desmond Howard. If they had
stayed put, they could have taken
cornerback Troy Vincent in the
number—six spot. Howard is a
great player, but so is Vincent.
The Redskin receivers may be
getting a little old, but so is
cornerback Darrel Green, the
only standout in the secondary.
Only Art Monk ('54) is older than
Green (51). They could have
also filled a major need at middle
linebacker with Mark l)’(.)Il(.)l.l'l()

 

on the 28th pick. The Redskins
got a great player but blew a
chance to help their weakest
areas, defensive backﬁeld and
middle linebacker.B ut the all-
time recipients of stupidity are
the Dallas Cowboys. That being
the king’s ransom they got in
exchange for l-lerschel Walker.

They finally spent the last
choices from the Walker deal,
and they had another great off-
season. Both first—round picks,
cornerback Kevin Smith and
middle linebacker Robert Jones,
should start immediately. They
got a quality wide receiver in
Jimmy Smith and were able to
get more help for the secondary

I Continued from page 9
we did, and we got a silver.”

The leaps-and-bounds

improvement of this boat is
nothing short of amazing. While
most two-boats pair two similar
sized men, Losken and Ridenour
are a lightweight and‘ a
heavyweight, respectively. In
addition, the duo has only raced
as a team for a little over seven
weeks.

Competing with and beating
teams that have been together for
over a year -- a feat the pair
accomplished — was little more

than a faint wish, according to 4

Losken.

“If you spoke to me five weeks
ago and asked me about our
chances, I’d have said there was
no way we’d get" to Dad Vails,”
Losken said. “But this week, and
the past couple of regattas, we
just put it all together.”

As for the performance of the
whole crew this spring, Losken
said the team did very well and
should be proud of its efforts.

Concerning Pitts other finals-
qualifying boat, things did not go
as planned. The varsity heavy-
four boat of Pete Alporn, Bob

Falk, (John Dougherty, Matt I

Precthel and Coxswain Leanna
Hopkins — prohibitive favorites
to capture Pitt’s first Dad Vail
gold— was disqualified for racing
out of its lane in the finals.
