Pitt Prof Named HUD Deputy

‘ Roger S. Ahlbrandt Jr., a University of Pittsburgh sociology pro-
‘fessor, has been_appointed deputy assistant secretary in the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development.

' Ahlbrandt, who has taught at Pitt for ﬁve years, will be deputy

assistant secretary for urban and community affairs, under the assist- ’

ant secretary in HUD’s office of policy development and research..
While at Pitt, Ahlbrandt has done research into neighborhoods,
including a report published last year which showed that Pitts-
burghers like their neighborhoods. _ ”
Ahlbrandt’s division of HUD is responsible for evaluations of the
community development block grant program, and department
funded neighborhood and community related research.

Pittjlin Court to Stop Disclosure

Pitt has asked the U.S. Supreme court to rule against a subpoena
ordering the university to disclose faculty payroll records of four‘
departments for use in a sex-discrimination suit. ’ -

Pitt attorneys believe that disclosure of the records will “foster
jeal_ousy and unrest,” among faculty and staff. Pitt also claims that a
positive ruling would put academic employment situations on a par
with industrial assembly-line situations. . .

The suit was filed by Margaret Carroll of the American Nurses
Association in July I977. lt charged that Pitt was paying the nursing
faculty less than faculty in other disciplines-.’" V _

In other cases it has been found that certainjobs can be point-rated

‘for comparison with other positions. This,.in some form, is what the

Pitt salary records are needed for.

Pitt State Appropriations Bill
One Step ‘Closer To'Passage

By SCOT STONE
Pitt News News Editor

senate Bill No. 854, the
$74,700,000 state appropriations‘

package for the University of Pitts-
burgh, moved astep closer to pas-
sage in the senate yesterday, where it
was scheduled for‘ a third reading.

According to a spokesman for
Senator Richard Tilghman, the bill
was “technically” ready for a vote,
but the addition of two amend-
ments, $90,000 for the dental school,

“and $60,000 for the Titusville cam-
pus, pushed the possibility of pas-
sage back at least until June 25.

Once No.8-54 Jis passednby the‘
senate, it is sent to the appropria-
tions committee in the house. The
committee‘ can amend it or sent it
onto the floor for debate. After three ‘
“readings_,"- or presentations, the leg-'
islation is ready for a vote.‘ Then.

Liberal Arts Mal0rs:How To Make.-.6
  Employers Want 0 Hre Yo“ 

By CHRISTINE WILTANGER

Pitt News Stcilf Writer

Remember the day you finally
told your parents what your major
was going to be‘? And the first thing
they said was, “But can you getajob
in it?" «

And you countered with the clas- I A

sic, ‘‘I‘m in college to get an edu_ca-
tion, not learn a trade. When I
. graduate, l'll'find a job.”
Now that the time is coming
closer. (your best friend just gradu-.
ated this last year, remember‘.’), you’

might be wondering about.job leads 7

‘ and what‘s out there that a liberal
arts major is qualified for.

"First off, you might as/well know.

it’s going to be tough. Its not that .

the jobs aren’t there, but in a society
geared ‘toward specifics, many
employers don’t consider a liberal
arts -education as giving the gradu-
ates any realskills. YOU are going td
have to make THEM want to hire
you. - 9

“Students have heard it before.
_but it stillcoines down to thesame
‘old ‘thing. That's selling yourself,"

according the ;career " couneelor
Teddy Fakles. “A lot of students
 refuse to believe it. but you have to
go in and convince the-employer that
you are qualified for the_’iob'.“ .

, The way to do this, of course, is ’
knowing all your applicable skills. If
you worked waiting on tables one

. summer. you know how to work
with people. Attending, classes,
working. and belonging to social
clubs show you can organize your
time and set priorities_.

ments, it is sent to the governor for
his signature.

The I house ‘announced yesterday
that it plans to take a summer recess
starting at the end of this month. ‘
According to a source in the Legisla-
tive Reference Office, there is
“almost no doubt” that the legisla-
tion will be completed prior to that.

“l don’t think that there will really
betoo much of a problem with it,”
said one Tilghman aide. “But there
could possibly be a problem when it
gets to the governor.” ‘

Any problems Gov. Dick Thorn-
burg might have with the package
involves the newly added monies for
the dental school and Titusville cam-
pus. Tilghman’s aide said that itvis
‘‘conceivable’’ that the governor
might decide to cut out the‘$150,000
in additional appropriations, but

Beyond The Man On

By MIKE MALLINGER

Pm News Stall Writer

Dr. Paul McWilIiams usually
starts his morning with a serene cup
of coffee but- by noon he is usually
embroiled in the problems of Boe-
ing, Westinghouse, and Gulf Oil.

The corporations. among the 200
yearly clients of Pitt's NASA Indus-
trial Application Center (N IAC) are
seeking answers to their multi-
million dollar engineering problems.

Pitt was tapped for assoc_iation
with NASA in I964 and since then
has continued its transformation of
space technology into practical uses
for business and industry.

McWilIiams pointed out that
NIAC’s purpose is to make use of
NASA’s computers so that the space
program would have a purpose
larger than shooting rockets into the
blue». '

“The basic thrust initially was to
transfer technology so that your tax
dollars that went for themoon land-
ing didn’t end there,“ he said.

Many private corporations do
work similar to NIAC. McWilliams
conceded the similarity but added,
“We are different in the sense that we
have~the entire University that we
can call on."

With both NASA’s data banks
and University specialists in league,

Pitt can offer services that are -- iii

unavailable elsewhere. The prob-
lem, according to McWilliams, is to
narrow the problem so that engi-
neers on a project are not frustrated
“reinventing the wheel.”

A corporation consulting NIAC
may find upon a search of NASA's

‘ computers that -their problem was
_solved twenty years ago or that a

signiﬁcant protion of their problem
has been already solved.

The computer now shaves the
time searching for solutions from
years into a few hours.

“We can tell what's been done,
who's working in the ﬁeld and what
kind of work they’ve been doing,"
McWilliams said. .

-Dr. Paul Micwilliams of Pitt’s NASA Industrial Application

Center.

He estimates that N IAC generates
several hundred thousandldollars a
year in consulting fees. ‘

“We charge based on the contri-
bution that NASA makes to the pro-
ject, the contribution the University
makes to'the project and then the
difference between that and the cost
of the project, is what the company
pays,“. he said.

  Issues
And  

Answers

Pitt’s reasoning for requesting the U.S.
Supreme Court to quash a subpoena ordering
Pitt to release faculty payroll records amounts to
an attempt to sidestep a valid issue.

The records are needed for a sex discrimination
case brought against the university by Margaret
F. Carroll of the American Nurses Association.
Carroll charged that Pitt’s nursing faculty
received less pay than faculty in other disciplines,
like social work or pharmacy.

Carroll and the Equal Employment Opportun-
ity Commission contend that a comparison of-
nursing faculty salaries with other university
salaries would be useful to them in arguing their
point. . '

T Pitt countered that comparing the salaries
would lead to academic rivalries “in this era of
rising costs and shrinking academic dollars,”
according to Pitt attorney James Restivo,_ Jr.

That hardly seems a valid excuse.

Are we to accept that the possibility of aca-
demic jealousies——if indeed that consequence
exists—outweighs the larger issue of the compar-
ative worth of a person’s skill‘.’..

The question at stake is whether Pitt’s nursing
faculty is receiving ﬁnancial compensation equal
to that of their counterparts. V

That question deserves an answer. The issue of
equity in pay scales for females is not unique to
Pitt; recently, the Supreme Court ruled that
women have the right to sue for higher pay for
traditionally female jobs.

Pitt’s tactics may delay reaching a decision on
the case. But only for a time. lt‘s an issue that has
to be settled. lf Pitt believes its pay scales are
equitable, then whether or not-releasing the pay-
roll records will cause some intangible conse-
quence is irrelevant.

Because a charge is brought against the univer-
sity does not necessarily mean that charge is true.
The university’s reluctance to release information
about its postion, however, is likely to lend a
measure of doubt as to its credibility.

Letters

Leon says Glew Letter Inaccurate

Dear Editor: A

This is in response to a letterto the
Editor. The Pitt New.v.June 3. over
the signature of Robert A. Shaw.
Department of Biochemistry."
School of Medicine (actually Pro-
fessor Robert H. Glew).

The letter contains several sub-
stantial factual misrepresentations.
For example. the authorstates in the
first paragraph that the Liaison
Committee on Medical Education
has given Pitt's medical school
“...accreditation for only 3‘ yea-rs
with probation." This statement is
an excellent illustration of the ‘mix-
ture of fact and hyperbole used
throughout Professor Glew’s letter.
The School of Medicine is not on
probation: in fact. it is logically
inconsistent -to state (correctly) that
we have received accreditation for
three years but that we are on proba-
tion. The letter of accreditation for
the School of Medicine was accu-
rately quoted in the University-

~ Timesof May 2|, l98l and copies of

the original accreditation reports
have been distributed to the Execu-
tive Committee -of the Faculty of
Medicine which includes Professor
Glew‘s department chairman.
Clearly. Dr. Glew had access to
accurate information.

Again, in his first paragraph Pro-
fessor Glew cites “a national survey
of medicalischolars that ranked
Pitt’s medical school irv 45th place.”

It is true that such a survey of per- ~

ceptions and op-inions was made;
what is not mentioned is that this
“survey” has gained little acceptance

by the national medicalcommunity .
including our most prestigious asso-‘

ciations of medical scholars.

Professor Glew's letter appears l0
speculate widely on numerous topics
without making speciﬁc statements
about them. The matters of
innuendo cannot be addressed.
However. he makes rather blunt
statements about a “conspiracy of
silence.“ Professor Glew has never
asked me about any ofthese matters.
Perhaps his lack of information is
due in part to the fact that he did not
attend a general faculty meeting of
the School of Medicine on May 2!,
l98l.during which several of these
questions were discussed. 4

lt would be a seri_ous misrepresen-
tation to suggest that there are no
problems facing the School of Medi-
cine. There are. and most are related

to the need to revitalize the basic

science programs of the School in a
climate of severe constraints on
money and space. A concerted.

Faculty of Medicine and the admin-
istration is being brought to,bear on
this problem. —ln so stating. it is
important to acknowledge that these
problems are no more severe than
those faced currently by most Amer-
ican medical schools. and in many
instances less serious‘. ln general. the
School of Medicine at Pitt is in a
healthy growth phase in spite of
constraints. E

chiatry.

Evidence of the School's health
can be found in the national stature
of Pitt’s Departments of Neurologi-
cal Surgery. Ophthalmology.
Orthopedic Surgery. Otolaryngol-
ogy, Pathology. Pediatricsand Psy-
The Department of
Medicine is in an accelerated growth

phase which has captured national

interest; Anesthesiology and
Surgery are also developing rapidly.
Pitt’s new program in Emergency
Medicine and its well-established
program in Critical Care Medicine
are notable achievements which
attract international recognition.

Pitt's medical school is a member
of the prestigious thirteen school
consortium, with Harvard. Yale.
Pennsylvania. Johns Hopkins,
Columbia. Cornell, Rochester. Uni-
versity of Chicago. Stanford.
Washington University and several"
others. These thirteen schools dis-
cuss and plan together concerning
academic and student affairs. public
policy and related issues so as to
inﬂuence program.and change in the
best interest of medical education.
Pitt's ‘membership in the consortium
indicates-;that Pitt has stature among
other well regarded medical schools.

Professor Glew further asserts A

that tuition levels of$ I 3,000 per year
per student for next year are being
considered. This statement is quite
without foundation. A ﬁnal deter-
mination regarding tuition levelshas
not been made because the Com’-
monwealth of Pennsylvania has not

yet passed the ‘non-preferred‘ por- -

tion of its budget and the Board of
Trustees _of the University have not
approved a budget for academic
year l98l-I982. The planning guid-
ance for next_year‘s tuition’ which

A has been given to students presently

enrolled in the School of Medicine
does not approach the figure alleged
by Professor Glew. It should also be
notedthat Professor Glew has not
asked me about tuition at any time
in the recent past.

Professor Glew further alleges in
his letter that the practice plans
(clinical service income plans) of the
School of Medicine do not operate
in the best interest of the school‘s
missions. Quite the contrary. the

financial contribution of the clinical’

practice plans to the overall mission
of the School is great indeed. and the
rate of increase in support from clin-
ical fees for undergraduate medical
education has been much more
rapid over the past five years than
have tuition. endowment income or
public support from the Common-
wealth and. federal government.
Professor Glew’s statements regard-
ing financial support from clinical
fees also fail to recognize that the
School of Medicine conducts a grad-
uate medical education program for
470 residents. In addition. .the
School must assume partial respon-
sibility for the excellence of put hos-

that there isn't enough food or water

insane. The effects of nuclear fallout ‘
are far worse than the initial blast.

 The sur-vivalistswould be unableto i

that the average bomb shelter any-
where near the blast site would prob-
ably surivive the first shock, then
quietly simmer in the ensuing heat

only l00million people would per-

benefits: lO0 million less Americans

Technological

Possible Solution

  To   0
Library Budget
Crisis

l.ibraries at Pitt are “hurting.“
according to Vice Provost Donald
Henderson.

ln the last few years inflation.
budget cuts_and some peculiarities
within the industry itself have come
together as coincidental conspira-
tors in an assaulton the system of
university libraries.

Ad niinistrators. close to the situa-
tion. talk about it as a problem. and
address it in serious terms. lt is odd
to hear them grow almost optimistic
when the topic of technology comes

UP- .

“It opens up a very wide range of.
choices.” Thomas .I. Galvin. dean of
the school of l.ibrary and Informa-
tion Sciences said’.

   
   

Libraries like the Darlington (above) illustrate the variety of
forms and uses of the university’s research system. 

But. as director of University
Libraries (ilenora Rossell says.
“there/are costs involved.”

’Pitt.’s I98! acquisition budget was
$l.()45.000. That is for new books.
magazine subscriptions. and a host
of other materials that are necessary
for the proper upkeep ofa standard
college research library system. I

In l9X2 it-will cost $l'. 259.000 to
buy books for Pitt‘s libraries.

_ “Our problem is the acquisition of
materials.” Henderson said. “We
have experienced a l9 percent infla-
tion rate for the first six months of
‘XI. and the money we’re getting is
about 20 percent more than last
year. so we’re just keeping up.“

\

What Henderson is talking about

is the incredible rise in the cost of

journal subscriptions and primary '

research materials.

As the number of journals

increase. the number of subscribers
decrease. And since the price of pub-
lication is tied to the subscription
rate, the price spirals. ‘
Henderson said that he had seen
cases of 36 percent increases in some

.journals in the natural sciences.

There is also the problem of staff
reduction. The Pitt libraries have
suffered many of the some austerity
measures that have affected other
departments. .

“We're a very labor intensive
field." director Rossell said. “Some

of the cuts we’ve taken hurt a bit.'f5
These are precisely the problems

that applied technology may solve.

One plan. according to -Galvin. ‘

called resource sharing. involves the
use of available technology to help a
number of libraries share a single
book. The primary components of
that technologyare the computer
and advances in telecommun-
ications.

“We have. something called
OLCC (On Line Computer Center)
in Columbus. Ohio." Galvin said.
_“There are 2200 colleges that belong
to it including Pitt. We will become a
part of a union catalogue that
includes the holdings of 2200 librar-

19

I65.

The computer system will-allow
member libraries to tap into a cen-
tral data basexand select any availa-
ble material for its patron’s‘ use.

“It causes us to build cooperative
relationships with other libraries.“
Rossell said. “Since you can’t buy as
many items for the local facility.‘ it
forces you to explore other ways of
getting access.“ ‘

There are already several new
ways forvthe Pitt student to tap into
the computer catalogue‘. The Center

«for Research Libraries. for instance.
is a “networking organization" that

1 ,

makes resoiirceisharing easier. It
buys less frequently used scholarly
material such as foreign documents
and doctoral dissertations. and

makes them available to member .

libraries through a cen_tra_l data-
base. ‘ -
“A hundred libraries don’t need t
buy these works.” Galvin said. “One
set will do and one hundred libraries

' _can 'share.‘_’

Computer terminalsare a prominent part ofthe changes in the libra,ri_es’method ofcollecting and storing
information. 0

scholarly magazines will no longer
exist in print forr‘n." ‘Galvin said.
“Someone will simply sit down at a
cathode ray tube and dial up a
report, press a button and geta hard
copy print out."

The idea of new types of“delive'ry
systems” is creating a bitof excite-
merit within the library community.
Not only can theyjmake more effi-
cient use. of scarce materials,‘ but

 In the last few years inﬂation, budget cutsand

Administrators, close to the situation, talk about‘

it asa problem, and address it in serious terms. It is '
odd to hear them grow ‘almost optimistic when the
_’topic of technology comes up. '
“It opens up a very ‘wide range of choices, f’ Tho-

By MARK VEATER

Pitt News Sports Writer

Basketball is long over in
terms of professional, collegiate
and high school seasons in the
Pittsburgh area, but the competi-
tion continues to be fierce among
the players on the courts in East
Hills Park. The reason for the
competition: the Connie Haw-
kins Adult Summer League. The
players on the rosters range from
professionals down to top hot-
dog players of Pittburgh’s black
asphalt courts. .

“We have the top quality play-
ers from around the area com-
peting,” notes Bill Neal‘, the
founder of the league. Mr. Neal,
a. one-time physical education
director at the Homewood-
Brushton YMCA, organized a
basketball league back in l976,
as part of his job.

Since then, the league has
grown into one of the best in the
country. Such stars as former
Pitt player and current Indiana
Pacer standout Billy Knight,
Keith Starr. Sam Clancy, George
Harvey, a former standout at

nie Hawkins himself come down
to do. battle on the basketball
courts in the hot summer nights.
“The league intensity is so strong
now, with the type of players we
have involved," says Neal.

The’ league is currently run
under a non-profit organization

Carnegie Mellon, and even Con- -

Hawkins League
Teaches More
Than Basketball

called “The Champions Associa-
tion." \ .
“We have about 200 volun-
teers on our staff directing the
programs. The whole program
grew out of the basketball league V
over , the years,” Neal noted".
There are 20 different depart-
ments, ranging from martial arts
to personal counseling to Big
Brother programs.

Basketball (may be the main-
stay of the Champions Associa-
tion, but as Bill Neal points out,
the experiences transcend, into
other facets of a player's life.
“Personal discipline is achieved
through the league. ln everyday
life, you must. be disciplined, in
your work or as atheletes on the
court, who must discipline them-
selves before they can perform."

courts.show the discipline Neal is
talking about. .

says, “seventy-ﬁve percent of the
whole program is structured for
the younger kids (under l9)." ln
fact, the young kids show up for
the games and aid'in Mr. Neal‘s
preparations.

“The kids are called ‘little
Hawks’ (taken from Connie
Hawkins) and they help clean the
courts and set up tables and
banners. The kids come out for
all the games to give me a hand,"
Neal said. But then, the whole

“Dream Comes True” For: B
Pitt Knuckleballer Lamonde

By JOHNETTE HOWARD

Pitt News Sports Editor

It was midweek and Pitt’s Larry
Lamonde‘s baseball
about as unpredictable as one of his
knuckleballs in ﬂight. _

The junior pitcher's hopes were
soaring Monday, the first day of the
major league draft, but his telephone
stayed quiet. By Tuesday,
Lamonde‘s expectations had dipped
dramatically and Wednesday, they’d
slipped to low, outside, and fading
fast.

But a phone call from the Pitts-
burgh Pirates changed things, or as
Lamonde puts it, “made a dream
come true.” And by Thursday night,
Lamonde, the Buc’s 2lst round
selection was saying goodbye to his

friends instead of baseball, and was ‘

packing his bags for Bradenton, site
of the Pirates rookie league team, to
begin his climb toward the big
leagues.

The Pitt News, Wednesday, June 17, 1981

“I got a little worried when I didn’t
hear anything Monday and then
Tuesday,” Lamonde recalled,
shortly after signing with the Pirates
Thursday. “l’m elated. lt’-s a dream
come true. I went to Central
Catholic (high school), Pitt and now
the Pirates.”

And he owes” it all
knuckleball.

Despite a team-leading eight vic-
tories and just one loss, Lamonde‘s
efforts this year‘ were often over-
looked or overshadowed by Pitt’s

to the

other draftee, hard-throwing Allen

Lachowicz, the Texas Ranger's first
round pick last week. While Lacho-
wicz was riveting most of the scouts’
pre-draft attention on his crackling
fastballs, Lamonde was floating the
knuckler past‘ batters and catching
the eye of the Pirate birddogs.
“Larry was kind of overlooked...a
well-kept secret,” said Jon Neiderer,
the Pirate's assistant scouting direc-
tor. “He’s got a real good knuckle-

ball. With that pitch, you‘ve got to ..

give him a chance to make it to the
big leagues.” T V

Although Lamonde used. the
knuckler relatively sparingly at Pitt, 
along with his regular staples-—,
fastball and A curve—the baseball .
experts tell him he’ll have to unveil
the knuckleball more often if he's to
make it to the majors. '

“I think the knuckleball is what
made the difference for me getting
drafted. The scouts have told me l'll g
have to start using it more,” \
Lamonde said. “Not too many peo-
ple throw it.” .

At least not as accurately.‘ as _l .
Lamonde, The knuckleball, because M -  A
of its lack of spin, is one of the easiest ‘ f A
pitches to throw and undoubtedly .__.

How can a financially
strapped AIAW-member‘

'athletic program stay within the

rules and still enjoy better‘ﬁnan-
cial opportunities, looser recruit-
ing priviledges and‘ more
exposure? '
Join the NCAA, Ladies.
And, like a horde of alchemists
being introduced to King Midas,

about 200 membercolleges of the-'   *

Association for Intercollegiate
Athletics for Women (AlAW)
have opted for the NCAA’s
golden touch, according to a
recent report in The Chronicle of
Higher Education.

In the aftermath of decisions
earlier this year by the NCAA
and National _ Association of‘
Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA)
to begin staging women’s cham-
pionships for the first time,
AIAW members are going the
NCAA way, a path that, in many
cases, would combine men‘s and
women’s athletic programs
under one organizational
blanket, as well as provide a
number of financial and rules
advantages. \

Ann Uhlir, executive director

will have about 760 members in .
the 1981-82 academic year, com-
pared to its 960 member colleges
last year. i
And, that 760 figure istlikelyto
drop dramatically again this Jan-
" uary, once "the NCAA. picture
becomes clear when the associa-
, tion’s governance boards will
meet to iron out the rules for its
v incoming women’s programs.
 Pitt,-at the mornent, is ..t.oCiI18
the “line between the NCAA and
AIAW. While all eight Pan-
therette varsity sports will con-
tinue to follow AIAW rules, two

sports—basketball and gymnas- .

tics——will try to qualify for this
year’s NCAA championships
instead of the AlAW’s. Other
Pantherette programs", like
swimming, may soon follow.
The main reason for the
switch—money.
The biggest incentive the
I NCAA is dangling in the face of
potential defectors is cash, or at
least an ‘in’ to the brimming
coffers the NCAA accumulates
yearly while the AlAW’s shoe-
string becomes more and more
taut.
Says Pitt’s Sandy Bullman,

, “Financially, the NCAA,;is'a wise , .
. move, especially for our stronger

programs. Right now, ‘the.-
NCAA makes most of its money
through television. With the A
NCAA, we’d get more publicity

in the newspapers, in other print

media, and _on tflevision.. There
are great possibilities in cable tel-
evision,. as well as regular sta-
tions and live TV."

Currently, the .AlAW‘s »,bias—_. .,

ketball, gymnastics, ‘swimming’

and track and field 4champion— ’

ships are televised nationally.
But, the‘ NCAA proponents
argue those contracts’ are not
nearly as lucrative as the pro-
posed ‘package deals and tie-ins
with the NCAA men’s finals
could be, even though the
women’s telecasts have‘ hereto-

fore "not proven to be rousing ' ‘

successes, at least in the Neilsens.
Bullman contends the AlAW
could have done a betterjob ne-
gotiating its television‘ pacts.
‘‘I‘m not sure they ha’d the proper '
people trying to sell the TV pack-_
ages,” she said. »“Wehaven’t been

, satis‘ried with the AIAW,"

Then there’s the"AlAW’s pol-
icy towards travel costs, one of

ships. Under the AIAW,‘ ‘Pitt
footed the entire bill for the Pan-

therette _bask'etbiall_ team’sv"two '

trips to‘ post-season tourna-

ments—one in_Pisc,a_taway,,N.J‘.. '

and the other in Amarillo, Texas.

Add thellth ranked Pan-  i

therette gymnashtics team’s trip to

the :Univer'sitiy of Utah for,’ .‘
nationals, pl_us’-the Pitt women's '

swim team’s tripto the Univer-

sity'_o_f ._'S_o_lith:__Carolina' f’o"r"the’ :
. AIAW championships, and the“

ledger shouts ‘til its red why». Pitt
is leaning toward the NCAA.’

“When we at Pitt go to a cham-V "

pionship, we have to pay every
pennyof roofn, boardand travel’
costs. If we got invited’to.the
NCAA champion_s.hips, we’d,

have a goodchance of being_t__i‘

reimbursed a little bit, ati=least,’i"
Bullman explained. _ A 
Take the Pitt men’s basketball‘

teams trip to the first round of.

man‘ will,

noted. _ t  V

While Bullman recogniies that
kind of money may be .years

gladly.- And, you '
needn’t say please; “They
received somewhere near-

eventually. We haveimore of a

" future with the NCAA." '

Anotther‘ sore point with many
AIAW members is the asssocia-

' tion’s liberal tra_nsferrule,’which,

unlike the ,NCA,A_,7 does not
_require an‘ athlete to sit out a year
of "competition" .after_ leap-

froggiirig schools. -,Wo'men"

freedom, many athletes have
exzercised, leaving their original

their lineups. , t .
‘e “The AIAW transfer rule
benefitsfthe athletes more than

the universities. It ''_shouldn’t .
cater just_to the athletes," Bul-

lman said. 1' i ,
_ln addition’! to the transfer rule,

4 the "NCAA’s looser recruiting
rules have some women’s‘ pro- 

grams even more interested in
switching allegiances. The strict-

er AIAW code forbids a school ‘A

to pay for an athlete’s campus
visits,‘ and. limits coaches to con-

tact prospective recruits only by I

Lachowicz update...

Pitt’s Allen Lachowicz left Mon-
day for Sarasota, Fla., home of the
Texas Ranger’s rookie league team,
after agreeing to contract terms with
the club Saturday following a brief
holdout.

Lachowicz, the Ranger’s first
round pick in last week’s free agent
draft, turned down several offers
from Texas and even threatened to
return to Pitt for his senior season
before the Rangers met Lachowicz’s
demands Saturday. The junior
flamethrower met a Texas represen-
tative at Greater Pittsburgh Interna-
tional Airport later that day to sign
the papers. ‘

“They didn't want to come to his
terms, but they called every day last
week and changed their offer several
times,” said Lachowicz’s father,
Joseph. “They met all his terms and
he’s very satisfied and anxious to go
and play this year.” ‘

According to Allen, the Rangers
indicated his stay in Sarasota will
most likely be brief. “If I get my
curve over and , depending how
things go, they said they might send
me up to their Class AA team,”
Lachowicz said.

You could say things are looking
up.

Headed for Vegas?. ..

Two’ Pitt Pantherette basketball

players, freshman Lori Arent, and-

pre-season All-America ‘candidate
Pam Miklasevich have reportedly
contacted officials at the University
of Nevada-Las Vegas requesting
information about the school.

At least ﬁye players and as inany
as nine players are reportedly con-
sideringleaving the Pitt team next
season for various reasons, includ--
,ing dissatisfaction with first-year
coach Judy Saurer’sV teaching
methods. According to a reliable
source,
tacted head coach Saurer and Pitt

Navada-Las Vegas con-.

women’s assistant athletic director
Sandy Bullman to inform them they
had been contacted by Arent and
Miklasevich. Both Bullman and
Saurer were out of town yesterday
and unavailable for comment.

Miklasevich, a 6-0 sophomore‘
forward, averaged I5 points and 8.8l
rebounds a game last season as a
starter. Arent, a 6-0 center, averaged
2.9 ppg in spot duty. Nevada-Las
Vegas recently appointed former
Pitt assistant Jim Bolla to a similar
coaching job at Nevada. Bolla was
an assistant at Pitt under then-coach
Jean Balthaser two years ago and
was supposedly very popular with
the players, many of whom were sur-
prised when Bolla failed to win the
head coaching job after Balthaser

same pitfalls and abuses the men
have,” said Alfreeda Goff, head
cross country and track coach
and one of Bullman’s adminis-
trative assistants.

“A coach needs that personal
contact with an athlete. Under
the AIAW, you’re not allowed to
visit an athlete’s home, you can’t
pay for her campus visits,” Goff
said. “Also, you can go watch
them play, but you can’t talk to
them. lt’s difficult for a coach.”

One cloud on the otherwise
rosy NCAA horizon is a com-
mon lament among many of the

‘ AlAW stalwarts, who warn
against the loss of self-rule they

  Pitt Leans to NCAA

say the NCAA merge would
mean. They caution that the pre-
viously all-male NCAA wilf
swallow the women’s programs,
and in the long run, even inhibit
their growth rather than aid it.

Bullman disagrees. “I think a’;
combined women’s and men’s
organization is possible—there’s
no real difference in focus,” she
said. “It's a two-way street. lt’s
advantageous for women and its
advantageous for them (the
NCAA) because gymnastics and
basketball are up .and coming
things. .

“We’ve got to get help from the
men. Let’s face it—it’s (the
NCAA) been in business for I00
years. They must know

something.”

Senate audits WVU...

The West Virginia Legislature has
widened its investigation into, West
Virginia University athletic depart:
ment finances Monday by ordering
a state agency to begin an audit
immediatley, according to the Asso-
ciated Press.

The investigations wereprompted
by a series of articles in The Morgan-
town Dominion-Post. The news-
paper _'examined records of the
account of Mountaineer Illustrated,
a program sold at WVU football and
basketball games. The .newspaper
said it found the account's receipts,
from program sales andadvertising,
had been used for. a wide variety of
personal expenses by athletic
department’ officials. The
Dominion-Post obtained access -to
the special account’si records
through the state Freedom of Infor-

mation Act. The records show large.

amounts of money from theaccount
were used to pay hotel, restaurant
and bar tabs, buy country club mem-
berships, and in several cases, to pay

the knuckler, even though, like most
other practitioners of the craft, he

has. no idea where the.pitch will head ,

when he releases it.
“I try to throw for the catcher’s

plate,” Lamonde says. “It might rise,

dip down, ﬂutter sideways or any-
thing. You never know.”

But the beauty of the pitch is that
batters never. know what it will do

either. It leaves hitters still scratch-

good knuckleball. And, ‘he’s got
intangibles.” ' ~— — 
.Ahhh,yes, intangibles.Say it with
reverence. While the screaming fast-

the,most revered quality a pitcher
can own, intangibles are sacred

crete explanation foTr-his pitching
success and ‘disputes the implica-

“I don’t think _I’m that slow,"
Lamonde said, laughing, but only
half-joking. -“There-’s more to pitch-
