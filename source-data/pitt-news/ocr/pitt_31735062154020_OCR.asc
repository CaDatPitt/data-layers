THE SUCCESS THIS YEAR
=At this time of good feeling and

S--h§.ridshaki_ng over the season’s vic-
_’,-tories, it is well to note‘ some of the

_men who worked continually ‘over the
Nether half of our football program.

I The team did their part, but we turn
"with.fpleasure"to those whose efforts
4 ‘did so much to make us what we are,
x and without. whose untiring assist-

ance we would have been nothinﬁi

 With due respect to those of the 0
- . «guard who have gone before, it may

9 "he said that these are the men who

. -i

.; brought us out of the position of

A  oblivion, and helped us to acquire 3

 

(‘reputation of fair play and athleptic
fiprowess, that gives us the privilege

to-stand out in the college world, and

 fl receive the hand of true fellowship in

 

clean -athletics from the best in ex-

~ I istence.

When we get off the ﬁeld and think

 for. a‘ minute of the men who have

  

    
  

 done so much for the Uiflversity, we
‘.'see that large, good-natured man, A

R._ Hamilton, ‘who,_ ﬁlled with Pitt
Wspirit, has fought side by side Wlth
s through thick and thin, and hits
een of such great aid to the athletic
committee. To him as much as t0

,a‘.ny one do we owe the success of
guur University athletics. ,
,-Charles S. Miller, our beloved ath-

Also we see

letic director, he, whose insp_i1'if_1g Per”

 sonality and keen appfeclatlon, 9f
* -clean athletics‘ has mapped out this

unparalleled‘ season’s work. The man

.,,who has done more hustling -and
 ,’»sigried the best schedule P1tt_€V€1‘
, lpplayed was K. E. Davis._ That inde-
fatigable worker has given to the

ijfUniversity the best there is in him,



 and made of this season the greatest
 success that has ever come to a

Uni-

yersity football team. Too. much

,.ci,t.,t,o.tn of ‘our hearts at the close of
his season, the summit of our ath-

 SEASON'S FINANCES
’f,.(},raduate Manager K. E. Davis, ’l0,
rtouiices that the season has_ been
,sueces.sful linancially as any in the
_s_t.- Owing to the bad weather the
.”te»i1dance was kept down, but. even
z.?th:e total receipts will equal if not
eeed that offlast year. However,
ieiincreased expenditures _for the
ack house, coach, trainer, improve-
Tents, etc., will keep the total proﬁt
”wn to a very low ﬁgure.

Columbia University extended an
invitation to the Conference to hold
its 1914 meeting in New York and

Yale University to hold it in New .

Haven. It was decided to accept the
Columbia offer for the principal ses-
the exe-
cutive committee to decide whether
or not additional meetings should be
held at Yale.

The addresses and discussions at
the conference were vital and of high
interest to alumni and to college
men generally but a presentation of
them in this article is impossible, be-
caiiseof limited space. I hope, short-

ly, to beable to acquaint Pitt alumni‘

and students with some of the more
signiﬁcant and helpful ones, through
the columns of the Weekly.

In the ncolithic age
When stone bracelets were in rage,
A million years before they thought
of pants,
Vi/hen a young man took a wife,
Just to keep his cave-for life,
He invited* all his cronies to ‘a
-dance. C

. II. 9 I
And they danced a sort of clog,
Wliile a shin boneon‘ a log
Beat a kind’ of booming, ‘lazy sort
of tune. ‘ ,
Roundfand round they used to go
In the red fY‘re’s sullen glow,
While an old hag kept a-chanting
of a rhyme. I
J ’ III.
And the coaties that they wore
Were a moleskin strapped before
And a lovely polished clamshell
strapped behind.
It was like amodern dance,
Like the kindjthey dance-in France,
So you needii’t in your judgment be
unkind.
IV

And a spitted cave bear sputtered,
And the dripping gravy guttered
In the clam shell that they used just
like a cup.
Wqhile the old folks, all alone,
Sucked the marrow from a bone
’ And the young folks cleaned the
choicer (lall$l€S up.

Tho’ they hadn’t beer nor money,

They got jagged on last year’s honey,
And the party always ended in a
‘ ‘ ﬁght, it

In ‘a glorious free—for-all

They would roll and scratch and maul
VVhile "the children cheered their

elders with delight. -
I

Then how liubbyused to rave
VVhen they went home to the cave
‘J .A~"h"d he stepped upon a pebble hard
and round. ‘
Oh, the awful things he said!
As be bounded on his head,
And his hairy form lay sprawling
’ on the ground.
VII.
In that far and distant time,
VVhich we celebrate in rhyme
Human nature was the same you
a must allow, .
And the troubles they had then
Are still busy troubling men.
As they’ll trouble them a million
years from now. 7
