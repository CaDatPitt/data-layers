Arts and Entertainment: A conversa-
tion with the Silver Jews‘ front man.

Pitt fans get fired up

by Lindsay Carroll
Staﬂ Writer

Pitt Program Council’s “bon-
ﬁre” wasn’t really a bonﬁre.

It was a ﬁrework bonﬁre.

Chancellor Mark Nordenberg,
along with football coach Dave
Wannstedt and the Pitt football
team, commenced the pyrotech-
nic show in front of the Cathe-
dral. A ﬁreball soared_acrOss the
lawn onto a pile of wooden plat-
forms.

But the ﬁreworks didn’t stop
there — the bonﬁre itself spewed
ﬁreworks into the cloudy night
sky, to the cheers of a crowd of
more than 3,000 Pitt students.

“It was a great turnout, and I
didn’t expect the ﬁreworks. I don’t

think anyone did,” said senior Ian
Russian. “I’m ve excited to beat

‘Y
Bowling Green.”

‘C

I believe if we keep our heads
on straight and keep our com-
mitment, we can be the best
team in the Big'East.

Dave ’ ,
Wannstedt

The Pitt cheerleading and
dance teams-riled up the crowd on
a stage, from which multicolored
spotlights lit the Cathedral, as Pitt
Marching Band marched down

Fifth Avenue to the stage and
played several Bon Jovi songs.

Radio D] Bonics and Talk
Kathy emceed from 96.1, and
speakers included Wannstedt, Pitt
Program Council directors Ab-
bott and Sarah Ollio, and Student
Government Board President
Sumter Link, said Pitt Program
Council public relations director
Christine Crevecoeur.

“This is awfully impressive and
awfully exciting,” Wannstedt told
the crowd. “I believe if we keep
our heads on straight and keep
our commitment, we can be the
best team in the Big East. I also
believe we have the best student
body, but we have to prove it ev-‘

ery week until West Virginia.”

College presidents for lower drinking age

\

by Lindsay Carroll
Staff W’/'£ter

Imagine hundreds of 18, 19 and
20-year-old University of Pitts-
burgh students walking down
Forbes Avenue on Friday night,
scouting for weekend parties.
Not difficult, right?
Now, imagine them doing it
legally.
. That’s a goal of the Amethyst
Initiative, a petition signed by 129

“These higher education lead-
ers have signed their names to a
public statement that the 21-year-
old drinking age is not working,
and speciﬁcally, that it has cre-
ated a culture of dangerous binge
drinking on campus,” said to the
organizations Web site.

Although Pitt did not sign
the petition, three local college
presidents, Esther Barazzone of
Chatham University, Gregory
Dell’Omo of Robert Morris Uni-

Chatham spokesman Paul Ko-
vach said the presidents signed
the petition not necessarily to
lower the drinking age, but to
encourage “civil and engaged de-
bate” about it.

“It’s the belief of all the presi-
dents involved that American
universities are suffering major
problems with young people
binge drinking,” said Kovach.
“It’s not that drinking is a serious
problem at Chatham, however,

He said the signatories wanted
to rethink whether the 21 drink-
ing age actually worked and to
form programs about drinking
responsibly. "

The Amethyst Initiative was
named after a Greek myth, in
which wine spills over a white
rock and it becomes purple. “Am-
ethyst” means “not intoxicated”
in Greek.

John McCardell, former presi-
dent of Middlebury College in

dents, he launched the Amethyst
Initiative in July. Since then, me-
dia attention has brought the
drinking age into national debate.

One of the petition’s biggest
opponents is Mothers Against
Drunk Driving.

In 1982, Ronald Reagan estab-
lished a commission to address

concerns about drunk driving,‘

for which MADD lobbied. The
commission suggested that rais-
ing the drinking age would help

colle e residents who want to versi r and Tori Harin -Srnith of drinkin roblems exist across Vermont founded the or ani- ii ht drunk drivin .

Act, which induced a penalty of 10 percent_
on highway appropriation if the state did
not increase the drinking age to 21.

Rebecca Shaver, executive director for
MADD‘ PA, said that “opening the ﬂood-
gates” for young people to drink alcohol
legally was “against reason.”

“MADD makes its position on scien-
tific data. Many groups, like the American
Medical Association, have done research
on how alcohol affects young people,”
Shaver said. “We know that the brain is a

brain development” _

Shaver said that lowering the drink-
ing age would increase traffic accidents,
although she thought underage drinking

should be addressed. She also questioned ‘

the motives of college presidents.

“I personally think that colleges may
look atthis as lowering their arrest num-
bers. It’s a dubious honor to be in the top
party schools,” said Shaver. “I’m sure the
arrest records are very high of alcohol-

that alcohol consumption creates.”

Pitt police officer Ron Bennett said he
estimates about 10 percent of a freshman

«Mothers are MADDabout proposal

cause they are closer to the minimum age
— just like you have 17 and 18 year olds
attempting to drink underage.”

The Pennsylvania Liquor Control

.Board reported that 3,378 alcohol—related

trafﬁc accidents occurred with drivers ages
21 to 25, the highest of any age group by
about 1,500. Since 1982, when the _drinking
age was raised, annual drunk driving fatali-
ties have decreased from about 26,000 to
17,500 in 2002.

But the nonproﬁt organization Choose
Responsibility attributes the dramatic
change to more than the drinking age.

Motor vehicles are safer, drivers better
protected with seat belt and airbag laws
and law enforcement, such as mandating
zero tolerance laws, sobriety checkpoints
and minimum blood alcohol concentra-
tion, is much more vigorous, according to
the group’s Web site.

Choose Responsibility counters the law,
claiming that banning alcohol for other-
wise legal adults creates a situation where
young adults drink in large quantities, away
from supervision.

Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention reported the percentage of alco-
hol poisoning deaths who were college-
aged people rose from 5.3 percent in 1999
to 9.2 percent in 2005.

The group suggests a waiver of the 10
percent highway funding penalty for states
that present a plan for educating and li-
censing adults to drink alcohol. The pro-
cess would include certiﬁcationisimilar to
that of a driver’s license.

The reaction to the Amethyst Initiative
has been diverse. A spokesman for Choose
Responsibility, Grace Kronenberg, said the
group had been researching the issue for
four years and could defend their research
against MADD and other organizations.

Still, MADD is not convinced.

‘ “I’ve had calls from parents of col-

lege students who are outraged, and our

volunteers, who have lost or had a loved

one injured in a DUI crash are outraged,”
said Shaver. “Obviously there is a cluster

of groups who think it’s a good idea, but I _

don’t think it’s been thought through. We

have to bevery careful.‘ This is the health

and well-being of our next generation.”

Residence Life Assistant Director Kath-

bonﬁre was to get points for the new Out-

Obama cuts the crap,
I Dems what they needto hear I

Sen. Barack Obama took the A

stage at the Democratic National
Convention last night and, amid
seemingly endless cheers and ap-
’ plause, accepted the Democratic
_ nomination for President of the
‘ United States.
The senator is the ﬁrst black
man to be nominated by amajor
1 party for the White House, and
0 his nomination truly illustrates
how far the nation has pro-
. gressed. The speech Obama de-
I livered last night coincided with
J the 45th anniversary of Martin

5 Luther King’s -famous “I Have

?a Dream”. speech, a reminder
 of the historic importance of
 Obama’s candidacy.

But last night, Qbama un-
I expectedly strayed away from
_ drawing a strong parallel be-
’ tween himself and Martin Lu-
i ther King. In fact, Obama’s
 words differed greatly from his
 usual speeches, which have gen-
1 erally been celebrity-like rallying
 cries for “change” and “hope.”
iWith more substance and less
 style, Obama was not just trying
 to energize those people who
 are willing to knock on doors
 for him, but was also making a
 strong effort to reach out to in-
 dependents and ardent support-
 ers of Senator Hillary Clinton.
' In this way, last night’s speech
jwas one of Obama’s strongest
 to date. Unafraid to tackle the
 Bush administration and Sen.
 John McCain, Obama said, “Mc-
 Cain likes to talk about judg-
; merit, but, really, what does it
; say about your judgment when
I you think George Bush has been
; right more than 90 percent of
i the time?”

With a focus mostly on social ,
policy, Obama addressed topics V
like housing and health care, is— M
sues that the Bush administra— 
tion has -largely neglected. The 
Democratic nominee promised 
to cut taxes for 95 percent of all 

working families. He vowed that,
in 10 years, the United States
will no longer be dependent on
foreign _oil. Obama promised to
invest $150 billion over the next

decade in renewable sources of ;

energy.

 ship isn’t even really needed. A

Obama was also not afraid 5

to address issues that many past
Democratic candidates have ne-
glected. For far too long Dem-
ocrats who claim to stand for
equality have neglected the issue

of gay andlesbian rights. Obama 
said, “I know there are differ- i

ences on same-sex marriage, but
surely we can agree that our gay
and lesbian brothers and sisters
deserve to visit the person they
love in a hospital and to live lives
free of discriminat:ion.”

But while setting clear plans
and goals on some issues,
Obama was still vague on oth-
ers. The senator should be more
upfront about his tax policy, for
example. Throughout his cam-
paign, Obama has been unable
to synthesize an explicit eco-
nomic plan. Obama has also
been vague about public educa-
tion. While he pledged to invest

in childhood education, he failed _

to explain ‘exactly how.

was refreshing to see that Obama

had left‘ much of his rhetoric  ‘

and style behind, making him a
strong and able candidate for the
White House.

tend to have fewer and fewer
ﬁiends ... A black student with

Kids don’t do this, though. In-
stead, they spend time earning
money, whether at the grocery store
or the street corner. That’s because
they’re shortsighted. So, if we want
students —- especially kids from bad
neighborhoods —- to invest time
and effort in educating themselves,
we should bring the payoffs of edu-
cation doser to the present‘, from
age 24 to 15:

The best way to incentivize
studying is to pay kids for doing well:
for attendance, for making grades,
for passing tests. And we should pay
them a lot. A smart kid who applies
himself ought to earn ‘several thou-

For the most part, however, it 1

pared to an educated person’s social

 value and the sums we spend on

the kids’ education anyway: about
$11,000 per year in Pennsylvania. I’ll
call these payments “rewar .”
Rewards’ time has come because
we’ve saturated the supply side of
education. We spend generously on
technology and teacher training. But

compare our students with kids in '

V Singapore who have fewer resourc-
I es and more drive. Also, even when

 5‘ teachers are our best, brightest and
I f most enthusiastic — think Teach for
up America — they often barely make

choice like we usually treat it —’ ’Stay
in School.” It’s thousands of small
choices about  pieces of
time, and even degrees of effort
when using that time. On the sup-
ply side, policy-makers affect just a
few circumstances like, “How many
kids are in this room?” But on the
demand side, rewards invade the
myriad day-to—day circumstances a
student decides alone and ties them
to outcomes the student honestly
prefers. “Should I take 10 minutes
to read this  article again?”
becomesgthe same question as, “Can
I get a new cell phone?”

However, though we can couch
rewards in terms of one kid’s incen-
tives, the biggest promise lies ir1 cul-
tural changes.

Consider: When a student dis-
rupts a class that faces rewards,
keeping others from learning, he’s
basically stealing from everyone
ahead of time:  whatever they
might’ve been able to buy. Peer pres-
sure comes to bear on the student
who might otherwise be seen as ad-
mirably badass.

Meanwhile, the stigma attached
to studiousness fades because kids
gain the socially acceptable motiva-
tion of wanting to make it rain. Re-

His biography is cool — all his re-

Now, the standard critique of
rewards is that kids should want to

for its own sake Why is this irrel-

1. There are already enormous
cash returns to education. Rewards
are simply those returns, but sooner
and smaller.

2. Kids’ wants are mainly exog-

3. Rewards and efforts to make
kids value education are not com-
peting uses of money. The latter
are mainly ways to» distribute praise,

L J, I worthy disappointment -
 or rather, more tears than
usual.

By the time a band’s third album is re-
leased, the listener might expect some sort
of musical progression, or possibly  reﬁned
sound of that which gained them a fan base

- in the ﬁrst place. For The Academy Is...,
however, the band’s third studio album, Part

5 Time: at Barrjngtrm Hzgb, takes the listener
 back to high school and ’90s punk—pop with

a dash of ’80s vapidity, and in turn, ditches

5 the music and loyal fans who helped them-
 risc to emo royalty. A ‘

That isn’t to say the album is horrible.

There are breezy melodies and some catchy A

choruses, some poignant lyrics and com-
fortably farniliar evocations of high school
days gone by. Ultimately, though, the album
is just not what listeners would expect from
the band that has helped popularize and de-
ﬁne a genre that needs all the respect it can
get.

This focus of the subject matter is the
first of numerous ﬂaws the album exhib-
its. W/ith its ﬁrst, CD, Almost Here, the band
crafted a pure emo sound’ with pure emo
lyrics. Subjects were generalized and made
relatable to a wide variety of listeners.

Last year’s Sanli, a favorite of mine, was
a deﬁnite evolution into a more mature and
experimental punk sound. The guitar riffs
were blazing, the hooks were incredible, and
gone was the often mistaken whininess of

the ﬁrst album, even though the band has

always set itself above the rest of the emo
pack with an innovative approach to the
. genre. These boys make music that usually
feels more genuine, honest and listenable
than average emo fare. _
The new album is centered on the ex-
periences of high school, as immediately
evidencedsby the ’80s movie reference inthe

‘ title. More speciﬁcally, it is the experience of

high school love, and every incarnation of it
available to any given 17-year-old boy. Seri-
ously, thereis a broad enough portrait paint.-
ed here to ﬁll the entire series of ‘‘Dawson’s
Creek.”

past its prime?

And if you are  the zany rnis— '

hapsthose “Creek” kids got themselves into,

’ or any other teen soap stars for thtat matter,

it is probably represented here.

Fart Timer loses the broad appeal of the
ﬁrst CD and the innovative rock—punk of
the second, and instead it slips into a com-
fort zone typically reserved for only the
most conventional of pop—punk bands. The
unfortunate effect so common to bland pop
bands of every song sounding exactly the
same could not be more appropriate, and it
is even more tragic here based on the band’s»
musical potential. C A

“About a Girl,” the ﬁrst single, is prob-
ably the most radio—friendly song the band
has ever recorded — based on the listener,
that is either the greatest compliment or the
worst insult possible. The fade-in opening
sets up a bouncing guitar—driven beat and
a chorus that perfectly exhibits lead singer
\X'/illiam Beckett’s most appealing aspect: his
ability to jump from note to note with the
precision of a neurosurgeon. In full falset—

p to mode, the clarity and conﬁdence of his

voice make it hard not to be wooed by him.

But after that, the album utilizes this
trademark of Beckett less and less, and to
a much diminished effect, setting many of
the album’s songs in a register that makes
Beckett appear horribly ordinary. “Rumored

' Nights,” 21  with a killer chorus about ru-

mors of a cheating girlfriend, is ruined by
vocally boring verses. “The Test” and “His
Girl Friday” share this tragic fate as well. .
“After the Last Midtown Show,” a mid-
tempo song toeing the edges of ballad—dom,
is marred by dull musicianship and then
cemented as the worst song of the album

; by its reference to the “best days of our

lives” being inhigh school. Anyone who has
been in college for at least a week knows, or
should know, that this is a glaringly wrong
misconception, and a cliched one at that.

Still, there are a few highlights. “One
More Weekend” succeeds at being both very
listenable and properly sentimental -about
the last weekends of high school.

“Beware! Cougar!” an inilially jarring
ode to romance. with a much older woman,
is perhaps the track most similar to older
Academy. “Coppertone” makes one nostal-

gic for the feeling of summer cruising, and _
it is the most plausible lyrically, as Beckett

sings, “But; this charade is never going to last
/ So pick the poison and pour yourself a
glass.”

If only the rest of the CD had been so
honest with itself. '

__Stu l's hometown deam comes to light

. by Jay Huerbin
Contrtiiuting E9£tor

For quarterback Bill Stull, play-
ing for a hometown crowd has al-
ways been a vision.

“I’ve always dreamed of and
wanted to play in my hometown,”
said Stull, a redshirt junior quarter-
back for Pitt.

“I always thought it would be
 to have a fan base in high
school that continued into college.

" "To see the same people cheering

for you is something special. I
deﬁnitely wanted that, and that is
why I’m here.”

Having that crowd follow him
is just what he got.

Born in Youngstown, Ohio,
Stull moved to the Pittsburgh area
with his family because of his fa-

.ther’s job.
‘}"2*»1t turned out to be his city. ‘

Success was always a part of
Stull’s high school career at Seton-
LaSal1e.

As a senior, Stull broke numer-
ous records. He became the ﬁrst
player in WPIAL history to throw
for 3,000 yards in a single season,
and he carried his team to a WPI—
AL Class AA championship as a
senior in 2004.

Even though a verbal commit-

ment to Kentucky was in place
during Stu1l’s senior year of high
school, tough recruiting from
Pitt began to change Stull’st mind.
It would not be long before he
would sign with Pittsburgh.

Seeing limited time as a quar-
terback during his ﬁrst two years
at Pitt- only caused Stull to work
harder to prove himself.

And prove himself he did.

Stull now enters this season as
the Panthers’ starting quarterback.
But this is nothing new.

After grinding it out during the
2007 training camp, coach Dave
Wannstedt gave Stull the nod to
lead the offense for a Panther team
that looked to be on the rise.

Unfortunately for Pitt, Stull
suffered from a thumb  in

the third quarter of the season

opener against Eastern Michigan
and was sidelined for the rest of
the year.

For Stull, being unable to quar-
terback his team and help to win
games was the hardest part of sit-
ting out of a season.

It might have taken a while, but
he realized that he could still help
his team, even if an injury meant it
wouldn’t be on the ﬁeld.

“It took me about a month to

Stull, page 25

- Bill Stull, who sat on the bench for two years before  his thumb last season, rehabbed all year

and was naxned the team's starting quarterback by Pitt coach Dave Wannstedt after a strong summer.

Attention all of Pittsburgh: Meet the real Shady

Senior Staﬂ Writer

We all know LeSean McCoy can
run and cut and score touchdowns.

mistakably elite, and (the buzz sur-
rounding him and Pitt this season is

Even through all the interviews
and TV spots, Enough, nobodyfs
asked the second‘-year  back
and Heisman hopeful the toughest
and most divisive of questions:

The Pitt News talked with him
earlier this week about everything but
football, for the most part:

TPN: Did you ever have a ﬁeshman
moment or get lost on campus at all?
LM:  lost? Nah, I’d just ask
somebody. And when I’m 
somebody, you bet it’d be the prettiest
girl She probably has the best advice
for me  .
TPN: What do you like to do when
you’re not playing or practicing?

TPN: What’s your favorite pizza
joint?

LM: ‘Um, I don’t know the name of
it, but it’s in Oakland, it’s right on cam-
pus  iight over there by Bouquet I
thinkit’s onAtwood  but yeah, good
pizza.

TPN: Have you ever had an embar-
rassing moment on the football ﬁeld
that you can look back on and laugh?
LM: I ripped my pants last year a little

’ bit   It was like a little strip

on the back end, like, you could tell,
but you couldn’t tell. You know, but
it was close to halftime, so I just ran
in the locker room and changed. Of

course, I was the ﬁrst one to run off
into the locker room.

TPN:  around campus, do
you feel like a celebiity at all?

LM: Wow, a celebrity? Nah, I
wouldn’t say I’m a celebrity, just a no-
ticed face, I guess You know, it’s not
too much. People might notice, say
‘\What’s up, Shady,’ or something like
that It’s not even like I’m a celebrity.
It’s not like Hines Ward or Big Ben
[Roethlisberger] or somebody where
they would harass them the whole
time Just college students just 
to say what’s up, say good luck, maybe
an autograph or two here and there
It’s cool.

.TPN= It thttt  that Fit stu-

i

dents might not know about you that
you would want them to know about
you?

LM: Man  I’m just a nice guy, you
know? I’m always smiling, having a
good time. I’m not really too tough,
either. I put the pads on and every-
thing, but I’m not too tough.

TPN: If you had to change one 
about yourself, what would it be?
LM: Oh, taller. I wish I was taller.
Like 6-4, 6-5.

TPN: Would you be a  back
at 6-5?

LM: Oh, no. No football  drib-
bles between legs and shoots). Me? I

QUARTERBACK; ‘

A Vou could actually make an argument
for South Florida’s Matt Grothe. Along

- with Heisman Trophy winner Tim Tebow

of Florida, Grothe was the only other I
player in the country last year to rush for

850 yards and throw for more than 3,500 N

yards. . ~
»: Pat White has won Big East Offensive

: .; Player of the Year the last two years. A .
Behind .a solid offensive line, it’s likelyhe-’ll .

become just the second player to win the
award three times. Donovan McNabb of
Syracuse was the other. ’ ‘

RUNNING BACK:
I A pair of sophomores  receive most

of the hype throughout the season, West
_Virginia’s Noel Devine and Pitt’s LeSean

"  McCoy are both home runs waiting to , '

happen. a

’ Devine takes over as the feature back
in an offense where Steve Slaton set West
Virginia records for rushing touchdowns

0'  (48) and total ‘touchdowns (53). Last year, N

as Slaton.’s backup, Devine averaged more
yards per carry (8.6) than either Slaton or
White. ' ‘ ’

 L ‘McCoyrush_ed for a  East freshman
record 1,328 yards last season. Consider

’ that McCoy -was just.a freshman, and he a

’ didn’t start until Pitt’s third game, McCoy , ~

could be in for a big season, the type that

OFFENSIVE LINE: I

When you consider the size of West

'Virginia’s backﬁeld last season, you really

get a good idea of show good its offensive
line was. All—Big East guard Greg Isdaner
is back, as is tackle Ryan Stancheck. Both
helped create do‘zer-sized holes that _
resulted in nearly 300 rushing yards per
game for the Mountaineers. Stanchek had

i 103 knockdown blocks last year and has _

been_recognized by Athlon Sports as a
preseason All—American.

PLACE KICKER:

Since joining the team in 2004, Pitt’s
Conor Lee is the Big East’s leader in ,
career ﬁeld goalpercentage (83.3 percent).
He’s missed just six attempts in his "two
years as Pitt’s kicker. Lee has also made
the most consecutive extra points in

Panther history. His streak is at 75 and ’

counting —
KICK/PUNT RETURNER: .

Thanks to the Orange’s deﬁcient
defense, Max Suter led the nation with
1,299 kickoff return yards. The knock
against Suter here is that Syracuse’s
defense should be improved, but not
enough for'4Suter to be starved of returns.

—  "DEFENSIVE LINE: 

. South Florida’s George Selvie is
among the nation’s elite at defensive end.

Ferraiolo: Look out for ,,., ,
CinCy's Mike Mickens 1

All-Big East, page 20

P for a loss (32). That total was also a Big

East Conference record. .
At Pittsburgh, any one of the
Panthers’ front four could make the all-
conference squad. Senior Gus Mustakas
was named to the Outland Trophy watch

..=.;.-; list awarded to the nation’s best interior
' ' lineman -— and isn’t even expected to
 start. Greg Romeus or Jabaal Sheard could

make the cut off the edge, but it’s Ernest
“Mick” Williams who has looked the most

,; impressive up front for Pitt throughout
 camp.

LINEBACKER:

Pitt senior‘ Scott McKillop is a
lock. McKillop led the nation in tackles

 last year at 12.58 per game. If there’s a
 knock on McKil1op,it’s in pass coverage,
 but everything else about his game is NFL
 quality.

V.‘ a longshot to earn ﬁrst-team honors, but

_7 his speed (4.5- 40-yard dash) makes him an
  pick. Lutrus earned freshman
 All-America honors last year after making
 107 tackles at outside linebacker for the
 Huskies. This year, head coach Randy
 Edsall moved Lutrus to the middle.

., Expect a huge season.

 realize that I can help out in different ways,”
:7 said Stull. “I can be a player-type coach on
2 the sidelines.”

While he wasn’t marching Pitt down
the ﬁeld, Stull was learning some valuable

 experience that would help become a bet-
 ter player when he ﬁnally became healthy

enough to compete again.
An improbable upset over West Virginia
that ended the 2007 season- was tough to

 watch for Stull. He realized, though, that

this was a team that was improving with ev-
ery game and every challenge it faced.
Still, last year Pitt had a different team.

1 And while a lot of players are returning,

Stull knows that this season will not be the
same. ‘
“We’re a different team this year,” ex-
plained Stull. “We have different weapons,
and everybody has had another year togeth-
er. I really think we are light-years ahead of

— where wewere last year.”

This conﬁdence is just what the Pan-

CORNERBACK:

There are some good corners in
the Big East, possibly none better than the
duo at Cincinnati. V

Seniors Mike Mickens and DeAngelo
Smith combined for 14 interceptions last
season. Smith tied for the national lead
with eight picks.

Mickens returned two of his six
interceptions for touchdowns. And as
a unit, Cincirmati led the nation in both
interceptions and turnovers. This tandem
is phenomenal.

SAFETY:

Robert Vaughn of Connecticut
had seven interceptions last year. Courtney
Greene of Rutgers is a two-time All-Big
East selection and had 101 tackles from
the free safety spot for the Scarlet Knights
last season.

PUNTER: , C

_ Kevin Huber of Cincinnati was
a consensus All-American Team selection
last year when he led the nation in punting
average (46.9). He could repeat both feats
this year.

1 thers are looking for, as they appear to. have

one of the most complete teams under the

_ Wannstedt era.

Offensive coordinator and quarterback
coach Matt Cavanaugh couldn’t agree more
about Stull’s improvement.

“He’s absolutely getting better,” said Ca-
vanaugh of Stull’s progress. “He’s gotten
bigger, stronger and faster.”

This spring, Stull began practicing with
a team he hopes to lead to victory this year.
An  might have sidelined him last
season, but his experience and conﬁdence
continue to rise, and "he hopes to peak at
the right time. V O

“The team respects [Stull] and they want
to play.for him,” said Cavanaugh. “That’s
leadership.” . ﬂ

And with the season approaching quick-
ly, Stull could not be more excited to get out
on the ﬁeld. '

“We’ve had a great summer,” said Stull.
“We’re ready to play.” ' -
