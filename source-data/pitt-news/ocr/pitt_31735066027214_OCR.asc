Prayer unites ony church

 

WASHINGTON, D.C. — Religious over-
tones in Bill Clinton’s inauguration tore
open old wounds about the separation of
church and state Monday, causing some
onlookers to question the president’s plea for
unity.

The ceremony opened with a prayer led
by the Rev. Billy Graham. In between the
vice president’s oath and that of the president
were musical numbers performed by the
“Children of the Gospel Choir” and the
Immanuel Baptist Church Choir and
Orchestra. The ceremony ended with a
benediction from the Rev. Gardner C.
Taylor. ’

Graham suggested, at the end of his
prayer, that a better world could only be
founded in the next four years with help
from “the Father, the Son, and the Holy
Ghost.”

Karen Nachbar, a third year law student

at George Washington University, said that
statement in particular offended her.
_ “I’m Jewish, so why would I need help
from Jesus to make my life better in the next
four years?” she said. “This all seems to
exclude ‘Jews and other non—Christian reli-
gions from taking part in this ‘great uniﬁca-
tion’ Clinton talked about.”

Nachbar said the ceremony should have
non—denominational ‘ blessings or no reli-
gious references whatsoever.

Abortion marches continue
despite recent violence

Heidi Price

 

Despite recent bombings at an abortion
clinic in Atlanta and ﬁrebombs at a clinic in
Tulsa, Okla., abortion rights groups and pro-
life advocates at Pitt have still planned activ-
ities for today due to the anniversary of this
Supreme Court decision.

Today marks the 24th anniversary of
Roe v. Wade. On Jan. 22, 1973, the U.S.
Supreme Court voted to grant a woman the
right to a legal abortion.

This date has marked protests, marches,
and vigils, and this year will be no diﬂ’erent.

The Campus Women’s Organization, is
planning a candlelight vigil beginning at 7
p.m. in front of the Wﬂliarn Pitt Union. At
7:30 p.m, members ﬁom the National
Organization of Women [NOW] and CW 0
will be speaking.

- “Ifyou look at the women who are real-
ly taking advantage of reproductive choices,
birth control, and having abortions  we’re
the prime target,” Kim Graziani, co-presi-
dent of CW 0 said, explaining why
Wednesday’s activities are geared toward
involving students on the Pitt campus.

Students for Life, in conjunction with
the Newman Oratory Student Organization
and the College Republicans, are traveling to
Washington D.C., Wednesday morning, to
participate in the March for Life. Students
for Life President Chris Duarte, who is coor-
dinating the trip to Washington, believes that

 

pro-life groups, despite the re-election of a
pro-choice president, are making progress.
‘This has been the ﬁrst year there have
been the lowest number of abortions since it
was legalizedj’ Duarte said. ‘
An issue for both groups this year sur-
rounds recent legislation concerning late-
terrn abortions. Congress recently passed a
bill that would prohibit late-term abortions
regardless of whether or not the mother or
child’s life was in danger. The bill, HR—1833,
that was vetoed by Clinton was sent back to
Congress, who unsuccessfully tried to over-
ride the veto. The controversy between both
groups surrounds the procedure involved.
“The literal dilference between what
our law says is murder and what our law
says is okay, is four inches,” Duarte said of
the procedure. “Move the baby four inches
one way and it’s murder, move it four inch-
es the other way and it’s not.”
CW 0 wants to change what they say is
the intentionally misleading assertion by
pro-life groups ﬂrat late-term abortions are

-used as a form of birth control.

“I think there’s a rrrisconception that a
lot of women are using this just because they
realize they were pregnant too late, and in
fact, most of the procedures are taking place
because they were endangering the
woman’s or the child’s life,” Graziarri said.

Pennsylvania law does not pernrit abor-
tions after the 24th week except in the case
of a fetal anomaly or when the mother’s life

is in jeopardy.

SGB and Pitt Program Council
silence rumors of ”bocl blood”

 

Instead of butting heads, ‘the leaders
of the Student Government Board and
the Pitt Program Council gathered
Thursday to put their heads together.

Along with SGB member
Marquette Bowman, President Justin
DalMolin met with PPC Executive
Director Lisabetlr Dixon at PPC head-
quarters to talk through their plans for
additional student services and activi-
ties.

Dixon, Bowman, and DalMolin
said no animosity exists arrrong mem-
bers of the two groups. All three said
they hope to silence any whispers of bad
blood between them.

“My intention was never to butt
heads, but to help out,” Bowman said,
alluding to his comments . during the
SGB inauguration on Jan. 8, when The
Pitt News quoted him as saying (about
student activities): “The programing is

     

Mastly .c.loudy, Low in th,e. :20s.   
.  3° .

not very good.” .

At the afternoon meeting, Bowman
told Dixon his comment was “accurate,
but taken out of context,” and said his

. comment was not meant to imply criti-

cism of the PPC, but to suggest there
was room for improvement in bringing
students more of what they want.

“If we [the SGB] are elected to rep-
resent the students, and they’re [the
PPC] here to help the students, why
would we want to work against each

A other?’.’ said Bowman, who will act as a

liaison between the two groups.

The_ meeting was the ﬁrst actual
gathering between the organizations
since two years ago, when members of
the SGB would sit in on the PPC’s
weekly meetings.

“We want to take an active role and
not just sit there like lame ducks, but
help in any way we can,” DalMolin said.
“My board members, like Marquette,
are taking it a step further.”

Religion 

“Some people believe in Jesus, and
that’s ﬁne; but others don’t, and that should
at least be respected,” she said.

Many agreed, saying the use of
Christianity in a national setting sanctions
one religion over another.

‘Tl1at’s why we have such a thing as
‘separation of church and state,”’ said

-Nachbar. “The government can’t recognize

one religion as better or more signiﬁcant
than another, and the opposite seems to be
happening today-

_ ‘The phrase ‘so help me, God,’. doesn’t
bother me, though,” she said. “In that case,
Clinton is speaking for and about himself.”

For that reason, Paul Mooney, pastor of
the Calvary Tabernacle Pentecostal Church
in Indianapolis, said he thought the prayer
was appropriate and that it was addressed to
Clinton, not the rest of the nation.

"Ihis is for Bill Clinton. It’s his inaugu-
ration, and the prayers are designed to inspire
and guide him for the rest of his upcoming
tenn,” Mooney said. “Since the president is
a Christian, it seems appropriate to have
those prayers to reﬂect his own religion.”

Mooney said that everyone elected to
public office has a right to express personal
faith. “If a Jewish person, or Muslim, or
Buddhist were elected president, they would
express their religion at their inauguration,
too.”

Some said the use of religion in a cere-
mony calling for unity was hypocritical, but
Mooney said it’s not hypocritical to both
pray to a Christian God and make pleas for
social tolerance in the same speech.

‘Tolerance includes letting a person
speak freely about their faith in a candid
way,” Mooney said. “I do not believe it was
the president’s intention to make members
of other religions feel excluded.” A

Still others at the inauguration said the
blessings simply made them uneasy.

Two Pitt students who attended the cer-
emony, Adam Rice and Rhonda Forkin, said
they thought the prayers were meant to
include a wide number of people and that
they weren’t purposefully said to exclude
anyone.

“It’s a tradition to have Billy Graham
speak at the inauguration,” said Rice. ”He’s
not just a spiritual leader, but he’s also very

political, and he’s Christian, so of course he’s

going to talk about Jesus and the Holy
Ghost.”

Rice said he thinks it isn’t possible to

have a prayer that includes every religion.

“I think people would have been more
offended if [Billy Graham] recited Muslim
prayers or Jewish prayers,” he said. “If he
only mentioned them a little, then it would-
n’t have been enough. There’s no way to
make everyone happy, because there are so
many religions with so many different
beliefs.”

Forkin said she thought the religious
overtones could have been more inclusive,
but she agreed there was no way to include
all religions.

“If they just dropped the prayer com-
pletely then even more people would have

been offended,” she said. “I’m not sure

tl1ere’s a place for [prayer] in the ceremony,
but it doesn’t bother me.

Forkin said organizers of the event
should have been more aware of how the
prayers would be perceived.

"Ihey should know that there are a lot
of different people out there with a lot of dif-
ferent beliefs,” she said. “They are repre-
senting everyone, after all.”

Donna Westerrneyer of Springﬁeld, Va.,
said she thought it was good to include spir-
itualism in the ceremony, but added that the
service should be open to as many different
faithsas possible.

“It’s hard to do that because there are so
many different faiths, and you’ll never be
able to please every one of them,” she said.
“It just seems to me that they didr1’t really
think about how exclusionary the ceremony

 

was. I don’t think it was intentio .”

Westermeyer said she doesn’t like the
idea of making the ceremony politically cor-
rect, either.

‘This isn’t about being politically cor-
rect,” she said. “Political correctness caters to
specific groups, and this is about including
everyone, every American.”

Norm Moline of Rock Island, lll., and
his daughter, Jill, said they had mixed feel-
ings about the opening prayer and benedic-
tion.

“I’m actually very involved in the
[Lutheran] church, but even so, the question
of how people of other religions might feel
about [the inauguration] did cross my mind
many times during the ceremony,” Norm
said.

His daughter said she only hoped

Clinton’s prayers and benedictions were sin-
cere and not just political grandstanding.

“If all of this is for Clinton to help guide
his presidency, I hope he means what he is
saying and what he s praying for,” she said.
“I’m sure he is committed to [his religion],
but sometimes it does seem like a lot of it
was for show.”

Norm said he wasn’t personally oﬂ°end—
ed by the blessing of “the Father, the Son, the
and Holy Ghost,” but said he also wouldn’t
be offended if it were dropped.

“The Son and Holy Ghost are theologi-
cal representations of a particular religion,
and if they left that out, then that religion
could easily add the two on in their own per-
sonal prayers,” he said. “When they’re left
in, they do seem to take precedence over
other religions.”

Inaugural parade draws
thousands despite weather

Marc Nuzzo

For President Bill Clinton’s inaugura-
tion, the city of Washington prepared for
one of » its largest, most expensive events of
the inaugural process: the presidential
parade.

Visitors huddled together in the 30-
degree weather, trying to find a warm place
in the sun, a good spot to watch the parade,
or both. »

Gathered among and between the ﬂag-
adomed lamp posts along Pennsylvania
Avenue, the road that runs between the
White House and Congress, many enjoyed
the entertainment that volunteers provided
on the street.

A clown in a purple silk shirt and
baggy white and blue striped pants per-
formed handstands and other antics that

served to pass the long wait for the presi-_

dent’s inauguration.

“I love this country!” whooped Rafael,
a bonaﬁde graduate of the Ringling
Brothers’ Clown College and member of
Kapitol Klowns, as he grabbed his heart,
ﬂipped forward onto his hands, and contin-
ued walking as though nothing unusual had
happened.

Applause and cheers rang out in
approval of Rafael and his compatriots
from the onlooking crowd.

Rafael was just one of hundreds of vol-
unteer entertainers specially selected by the
inaugural comrnittee to perform along the
avenue during the long morning hours.
Meanwhile, people gathered to ‘ hear
Clinton’s noon—tirne inauguration and see
the parade.

Speakers were wired through the
streets and broadcasted “Mall updates,”
presidential trivia, and the inauguration cer-
emony to the several hundred thousand in
attendance.

Occasionally a “tick-tick—tick” broke
through the echoing megaphone voices,
drawing the crowd’s attention back to the
street, where a jump rope entertainer per-
formed an energetic show.

“This is quite an honor and very excit-
ing,” said David L. Fisher of The Rope
Warrior, Incorporated, taking a minute
between his physically demanding perfor-
mances.

Fisher said he had performed at such
events as the Goodwill Games, making the
inauguration another highlight on a list of
many.

He vaulted around the spinning jump
rope, spun it back and forth, and even
jumped rope as he sat on the ground. These
stunts caught the attention of everyone
around him, from a class of visiting stu-
dents from Redland, Calif., to the on-loca-
tion co-host of “Good Morning America,”
Charles Gibson.

Volunteers handed out thousands of

small American ﬂags to the crowd, that

 

quickly began waving them to the beat of
an approaching traditional African drum

— ensemble.

Wide—eyed children tugged at their par-
ents’ sleeves, pointing at the ensemble
which was dressed in colorful traditional
African clothing. '

Looking onto the crowd, one volunteer
security person laughed as she cupped her
hands over her face for warmth.

“This is wonderful,” said Cindy
Garon, the smiling White House staff vol-
unteer.

Several feet behind her rode a man in a
blue suit and white pants on a bicycle that
trailed an Uncle Sam windsock. He weaved
through the crowd, smiling brightly.

“People seem to be in good spirits,”
said Phil Schwartz, the rider, a D.C. native
who prefers to be called Uncle Sammy.
“You just hope" for the best and try not to go
into [the next 4 years] with a wrong atti-
tude.?’

Waving goodbye, Uncle Sammy dis-
appeared among a swarm of unicyclists
posing as “The Thinker,” and juggling pins
adorned with stars and stripes.

As the afternoon wore on and the vari-
ous acts faded into the inauguration cere-
mony and then back into a wait, the per-
formers were replaced by uniformed Secret
Service agents, police, and military person-
nel. Many‘ stood rigidly and at regular inter-
vals, monitoring the crowd.

One constant throughout the day was
the presence of vendors selling inaugural
trinkets.

, “Buttons! Get your inaugural buttons
here! One dollar!” was a universal cry from
vendors behind makeshift booths.

By 3:15 p.m., the crowd, that began to
pass time doing the wave with their little
ﬂags and singing patriotic songs, was
rewarded with a president.

From the end of Pennsylvania Avenue,

a thin line of blinking headlights from the ’

police escort signalled the beginning of
President Clinton’s motorcade. _

Slowly the motorcade approached,
bearing inaugural committee members,
Supreme Court Justices, and high ranking
military oﬂicials.

From behind a tinted—glass window, in
a limousine surrounded by Secret Service
agents on foot, waved the re-inaugurated
president. Sharing his time at windows on
both sides of the car, Clinton embodied the
“new spirit of community” he spoke about
just hours before.

As he passed, the crowds fanatically
waved their miniature ﬂags. A pulse of
cheering followed the president down
Pennsylvania Avenue, echoed with the
passing of Vice President Al Gore.

Bands played on, armed services
members marched in formations in the
road, and Bill Clinton prepared for our
country’s next four years as the sun set on

the nation's capital.

The three maintained a calm, ﬁrst-
name basis atmosphere during the meet-
ing, as each person took turns listening
and providing feedback to each sugges-
tron.

They discussed ways to capture the
opinions of a greater number of the stu-
dent body. Dixon and DalMolin said their
respective organizations will expand their
home pages on the intemet to provide
space for students to give ideas and com-
ments.

DalMolin proposed ‘holding a serni—

said. He said hopes to alert students of the
methods companies use to target students
who don’t fully understand the risks
involved.

Dixon mentioned the possible experi-
mentation of movies during the week,
speciﬁcally a Wednesday night showing.

She also informed the SGB members
of the PPC’s “rolling budget of $350,000”
and the risk of bringing big names to the
Pitt campus, referring to last year’s visit
by Billy Joel.

“Since Billy Joel happened to coin-

‘ cide with Greek Week, we were the only

campus across the country that didn’t sell
out his show,” Dixon said.

Consequently, the lack of funds raised
at the show failed to offset most of the
$30,000 cost -—- which was even more
costly considering that it was toward the
end of the year, when the PPC’s budget
has mostly run dry.

DalMolin said he would investigate
why the students aren’t permitted to hold

though a concert was just held there to

intention to “take advantage of our prox-
imity to the city of Pittsburgh, by organiz-
ing more concert trips to the Civic Arena.”
He also introduced the possibility of con-
verting Choice Dollars into a payment.

Dixon suggested an alternative to
Bigelow Bash: an open-air concert by

Each personexpressed satisfaction as
they left the meeting, all the while realiz-
ing this was only the initial step towards

vices and events for Pitt students.

“We’re starting from scratch,” said
Dixon. “But, on a good note.”

[IE] VIEWS  

  

topping aortions takes
more than legislation

It is time to pause and contemplate the significance
of the Supreme Court’s monumental decision to grant
women the right to -a- legal abortion. Happy 24th
anniversary, Roe v. Wade. ._

In guaranteeing women the right to choose, Roe v,

Wade became not only a testament to the importance or I

having control over your own body, but also an issue of
continued controversy.

The Pitt News is a firm believer in the right to
choose. In granting women this right, Roe v. Wade does
not advocate abortion. It simply allows a woman to
make a responsible and educated moral and medical
decision in relation to her own body. It does not allow
the government to dictate what is right and what is
wrong to do with one’s own body.

To those who would like to take away the right to
choose, we ask the question of whether or not they
would like the government to tell them that they must
have an abortion. If one extreme is to outlaw the use of
abortion, the other extreme would.be to mandate the
usage of abortion.

Instead, we advocate that those who feel abortion
is wrong should work to alleviate the necessity for
abortions to be performed. Instead of carrying pictures
of aborted fetuses and singing hymns, why not work to
make the occurrence of rape a thing of the past? The
same goes for incest. Distribute literature on birth con-
trol and make contraceptives more accessible.
Advocate sex education in schools to familiarize stu-
dents with the risks and consequences of sex. The
knowledge of one’s own body and of how to properly
protect one’s self from disease and unwanted pregnan-
cy needs to be acquired before one becomes sexually
active.

Tonight, take the time to ponder what Roe v. Wade
means to our country and our freedom, maybe light a
candle with CWO on the Cathedral lawn, and thank the
Supreme Court for recognizing our right to choose.

I was seduced by BILI-CUNTON!

Against my will, I have been
seduced by Bill Clinton. Yes, your
Honor, I was alone in my bedroom, a
srnal1bookinmyhandwhen,tomy
surprise, the piesident’s voice started
speaking in my head I was power-
less to resist, but I’m not a lawsuit
kind of girl, so I’ll content myself
with exercising my freedom of
speech —just like Bill does in his
new book, “Between Hope and
History.” Several years ago, I came
from Thatcher’s Britain to Reagan’s
America At the time, I was com-
pletely disillusioned and disinterest-
ed in politics (Hrmn, wonder why).

But I’ve always been intrigued
with Bill and his _wife. They were
young, more of my generation than
any other political ﬁgures I could
remember. They had ideas, not just
rhetoric about how bad the other
guys were. They didn’t hate gay peo-
ple; they knew about single mothers,

. and cared about children. I bought

the bookinpart as a gesture of protest
at the mudslinging which dogs the
president, the accusations that he has
no values, and other hot air non-
issues. I also bought it in part as a
gesture of support for a president that
I could not actually vote for, being a
resident alien. Of course, I’ve also
rriade the big $3 donation to the
Presidential Reelection campaign on
my tax returns, too. But now, I’m
seriously considering getting even
more involved, and it’s all Bill’s fault.

As a foreigner, I have often been
fascinated with such questions as,
what defines Americans? What
about these egalitarian ideals, and a
written constitution — how does it
work? During the ‘80s, I could only
conclude that America was essential-
ly just like any other system -—— the

rich got richer, the poor got screwed,
and never the twain shall meet. A
dog-eat-dog world, just like Britain,
just like Russia, just like anywhere.
But then, I never read the words writ-
ten on a penny, either.

Bill says: ‘Take a penny from
your pocket. On one side, next to
Lincohi’s portrait, is a single worth
‘Liberty.’ On the other side, is our
national motto. It says, ‘E Pluiibus
Unurn’ — Out of Many, One. It does
not say ‘Every Man for Himself”

Hmrn, now there’s a distinction
to make. Unfortunately, left to our
own devices, we are a selﬁsh species,
especially when we start getting a lit-
tle bit ahead of the game and start
worrying about how to keep what
we’ve managed to scrape together in
our comer. So in order to truly have
“equal opportunity,” there has to be
some regulation in what is taken and
what is given back — like taxes for
Head Start programs or tax breaks
for companies who reduce waste,
toxic and otherwise.

The book is divided into three
basic sections, which are also the
essential theme of the book.
“Opportunity,” “Responsibility,” and
“Community.” Whatever you like to
call it, having read the book in the
man’s own words (and as I read, I
could hear him saying it), I feel pret-

_ty conﬁdent in the ability of this man

to “lead us across the bridge to the
21st Century.” Certainly I have read
nothing by anyone else, politician or
otherwise, which can be described as
a pleasant, maybe even possible,
vision for the future. The Ross Perots

of this world epitomize, for me, the-

misreading of the motto “E Pluribus
Unum.”

For another thing, Bill’s done his
homework. He has read history,
quotes from multiple literary sources,

an,"  clear, lucid style. I

about. His 1,-.s.1e?s.;.*:.‘*E,  f“’“"‘or gum?

reasonablepersonto ‘ q  if
you are given opportunity, you
should use it responsibly and then
give back to the community which
gave it to you He cites the Family
and Medical Leave Act, the Brady
Bill, and various legislations which
force companies to cut toxic waste
and rewards those that do. He cites
the companies who espouse the same
values of opportunity and responsi-
bility, with progressive policies on
family leave, bonus payments, and a
commitment to the environment.
Europeans often have a rather
stuck-up attitude toward Americans.
Bill notes that 19th century writer
Alexis de Tocqueville said that one of
the most distinguishing characteris-
tics of Americans was the eagerness
to form associations. I would agree
that Americans are, on the whole,
much ﬁiendlier and more outgoing
than Europeans. Having been a lone-
ly foreigner and the recipient of
much of this ﬁiendliness and gen-
erosity, I am no longer the kind of
European who has a stuck-up atti-
tude towand Americans. In fact, am I

a European at all? I’m thinking of

ﬁnally doing the deed and applying
for citizenship. It's partly because I
am almost ready to give up my life-
long cynicism and buy into the
American Dream, as described by
President Bill Clinton. America and
her president have ﬁnally infected
me with optimism, and the college
degree is helping, too. Buy “Between
Hope and History,” read it, and
believe it.

p.r. taylor hopes this new venture into
optimism works out —— if not, she'll
end up even grumpier than Bob
Dole.

Now this has got to be the Real Dea

 

Evander Holyfield, pious gentle-
man and wor1d’s heavyweight box-
ing champion, made a deal with the
devil last week. I

Well, not the devil. Actually, it
was Don King, but that’s pretty
close.

Evander and Mr. King have set
terms for the Holyfield-Mike. Tyson
rematch, scheduled for some time in
May. For the fight, Commander
Vander gets $35 million. At least.

It is the richest payment for a
single athletic event ever, unless you

count jogging to the mini-mart to
buy a winning lottery ticket.

Scary part. is, he’ll earn every
penny. 5

Boxers have taken falls for less.
Bruce Seldon earned less than $10
million to claim that a phantom

Tyson punch hit him on the top of his _

head and knocked him cold.

 

Matt Grove

   

“Gee willikers, this is just ragged,
sloppy basketball.”

“It’s' like taking a match, lighting it,
and sticking it in a pail of water.”

These are just two of the comments
the voice of the Panthers’ Bill Hillgrove
had last night as Pitt fell to its host, Boston
College, 81-61. The Eagles raised» their
record to 14-2, 7-1 in the Big East, with
the win, and Pitt evened their record to 9-
9 with the loss, 3-3 in conference play.

Head Coach Ralph Willard didn’t
have any positive thoughts following the
game, either.

‘This was just a poor effort in every
single area,” Willard said. “They just
pushed us all over the place. This wasn’t
like the effort we’ve given all year.”

Pitt led only twice in the game, 2-0 to
open up the scoring and then 7-6 before
Boston College went on an 18-3 run to
knock the Panthers out.

The Panthers welcomed back their
man in the middle, Mark Blount, but the

' Willard

7-foot sophomore never became a factor
in the game. Blount played only 12 min-
utes, all in the ﬁrst half, and he finished
with only two points.

“His hand is still hurting him a lot,”
said. “We need him for
Saturday’s game at Georgetown, so I did-
n’t want to risk anything.
He just couldn’t hold
onto the ball tonight.”

The Eagles took
every advantage of the
Panther’s lack of quality
play in the paint all
night. '

Boston College’s
big men dominated
inside all evening. All American candi-
date 6-foot-7, 270-pound Danya Abrams
pushed Panthers around all night and had
15 points for the Eagles. Mickey Curley, a
6—foot-9, 250-pound junior, also helped
pound away at Pitt as he ﬁnished with 16
points and 12 rebounds, eight on the
offensive glass.

Antonio Granger, a 6-foot—6, 205-
pound junior, chipped in with 14 points

    

for the Big East-leading Eagles.

. Last week, Vonteego Cummings was
named the Big East Player of the Week
after huge games against Rutgers and
Miami. The Boston College coaching
staff and Scoonie Penn didn’t let that fact

go unnoticed as their schemes coupled

with poor shooting held
the smooth sophomore
guard to a season-low
three points. Cummings’
only points came on a.
three—pointer late in the
first half. -
Boston College led 42-
25 at the end of the first
half, but whatever Ralph
Willard said in the locker room must have
gotten the Panthers fired up. Pitt opened
up the second half by scoring the first
seven points to cut the lead to 10. That
was the closest the Panthers would get as
sloppy play on defense and some ques-
tionable calls gave the Eagles some easy
breaks.
Usually-hot Jason Maile was shut
down all evening and was held to eight

points. The biggest play all night involv-
ing Maile was on defense midway
through the second half. Maile fouled
Scoonie Penn hard as he raced towards
the hoop, but he saved the Eagle guard
from falling into the stands. The benches,
coaches, and fans remained silent, but an
intentional foul was whistled to the sur-

prise of everyone. Scoonie Penn hit both"

freebies, and then Abrams hit two more
following a Varga foul to extend the lead
to 16.

Chad Varga led Pitt with 14 points, 10
in the second half. Kellii Taylor added 10
points and Jarrett Lockhart came off the
bench to score nine points after playing
zero minutes in Saturday’s loss to St.
John’s.

“You could blame the loss on our
guards, but our big men had no move-
ment. They stood still and basically had
no post-up games,” a solenm Vtrillard said.
“I didn’t see any bright spots at all. We
had horrible focus — it was absolutely
missing. I’m not sure of the reason for
that; we had nobody step up to the plate
tonight.” .

Leon Murray: Pitt’s latest two-sport star up close

xlachariah Blott  H J

 

What do Wilt Chamberlain,
David Hasselhoff, and Pitt’s Leon
Murray all have in common?
None are happy with just one
activity. ’

Leon Murray is Pitt’s first
athlete since Nate Cochran two
years ago to try his hand at the
two “money sports.” Murray, a
redshirt freshman, played wide
receiver on the gridiron through
November, and is currently a
guard on Pitt’s basketball team.

Coming out of high‘ school in
Louisiana, Division I schools
were recruiting Murray for both
sports. In football, Texas A&M,
Texas, Kentucky (where his
father played football), and Pitt
were pursuing him. Miami (OH
and FL), LSU, and Tulane

showed interest in Murray’s bas-
ketball skills. Leon, although
more interested in football in high
school, was still interested in
both.

“Our football team in high
school was really good, and we
always had big crowds. But I had
played both sports all my life, and
I enjoy bot .”

j The transition from football
to basketball this December was
especially difficult on Leon.

“It was really tough. I thought
I was in good shape, but the
sports have two different kinds of
running, so it was rough.”

Basketball Head Coach Ralph
Willard agreed, “He came out
late, so it’s hard for him to
adjust.”

Willard added, though, that
Murray adds a lot to his squad.

“There is no question about

the depth he brings to this team.
He’s extremely athletic and quick.
In practice he guards Jason
[Maile] a lot, so that makes Jason
a better player.”

Teammate Gerald Jordan also
said, “He can leap well; he has
good quickness; and he shoots
well from the three. He also gives
us extra depth; he helps a lot in
practice; and he’s a good defend-
er.”

So far this season, Murray has
seen playing time in four games,
most recently picking up a
rebound and an assist in Pitt’s vic-
tory over Northwestern in The
Rainbow Classic. He’s averaging
1.5 points and 1.0 rebounds in 4.8
rriinutes per game.

Football is still Leon’s
favorite sport, though. In high
school, Leon was named a Street

Redshirt lreman Leon Murray will likely be a key factor for both
football coach Walt Harris and basketball coach Ralph Willard.

Women's swimming splits weekend

Matt Townsend

 

Last weekend, ' the
women’s swim team battled
another double dosage of
savvy opponents in Penn State
and West Virginia. The team
split the two meets just as it
did against UNC and NC
State the weekend before. The
weekends were almost identi-
cal as the Lady Panthers lost
to Penn State on Friday 165-
135, and then regrouped and
swam better on Saturday to
overwhelm West Virginia
177.5-65.5. The victory over
West Virginia puts the team at
a 2-5 record.

“We had a great weekend.
Everyone was ready to swim,
and we knew what we had to
do,” said Junior Captain
Leslie Becki.

The first event of the Penn
State meet would be the ongo-
ing theme for Pitt all after-
noon: losing tight races. In the
200-medley relay, the team of
Beth Grube, Nicole Palombo,
Liz Perry, and Heather

- Brennan were touched out by

three-tenths of a second.
Grube again was second chair
to a Nittany Lion in the 100-

back, losing by a tenth of a
second this time. The fresh-
man Brennan couldn’t hold
the lead in the 50-free, either,
and lost by less than three-
tenths of a second.

Despite losing these
races, Pitt also closed out and
won some. The 200—free relay
team of Isabel Dejo, Melissa
Burns, Grube, and Brennan
won with a 1:37.90, edging
out PSU by two tenths. Grube
avenged her loss in the 100-
back witha convincing win in
the 200 at a 2:05.83.
Freshman Liz Perry won the
100-ﬂy by a little more than a

second with a 58.72.
Freshman Jamie
Tomazich continued her

superb diving with a double
win in the one and three-meter
events. For Tomazich it was
the third meet in a row she
took home both diving events.

“Penn State is a very
strong team. We did very well
against them. We gave them a
run for their money. Halfway
through the meet they had to
change their line—up in order
for them to beat us,” said
Becki.

meet against West Virginia the

team knew they could win in a
romp. They did just that in
scorching the Mountaineers
for five wins in the first five
events. After the quick start,
Pitt rolled through the rest of
the meet, winning by 112
points.

In the opening event,
Tomazich was unbeatable
again in winning the 1-meter
diving event for the second
time that weekend. Next, the
400--medley relay team won
by more than seven seconds
with a 3:29.54. Then, sopho-
mores Samantha Chabotar
and Jen Slack took first
(10:13.52) and second
(10:29.73), respectively.
Finally, Burns won the 200-
free in 1:55.94, and Brennan
won the 100-free at a 24.83,
winning by one-tenth of a sec-
ond.

“We knew what we need-
ed to do against West
Virginia, and we did it. They
were pumped to swim us, and
we were ready for them,” said
Becki.

This weekend Pitt again
will travel to meet two above-
average opponents in LaSalle
and reining Big East
Champion, Villanova.

Wednesday, January 22, ‘I997

Michael Spinks made
over $100,000 per second
in his 90-plus second fight
with Tyson, spending most
of the time on his back.
Buster Douglass signed for
close to $15 million in his
first title defense against
Holyfield, came into the
fight looking like a Jenny
Craig “before” photo, and
got KO’d in the third round.

Evander had his chance
to grab the cash last year,
signing for around $10 mil-
lion to challenge then-
unstoppable champ Tyson.
Nobody thought the ex-
”700 Club” guest had a
prayer. Turns out he had a
prayer and a really good
right hand.

Unlike the rest of the
heavyweight division (and
the rest of humanity), the
Real Deal isn’t afraid of
Iron Mike. He relies on
months of intense training,
hours of film analysis, and
faith in Jesus Christ to get
him through most anything,
including the ex-“Baddest
Man on the Planet.”

King has yet to reveal
the propaganda for the pro-
posed May fight, but it has
been affectionally dubbed

“The Rematch.” More than
likely, the pay-per—view
commercials will saturate
the airwaves with phrases
like, “This time, Tyson
takes no prisoners,” or
“Now, he’s mad,” or “Make
sure he’s ‘angry —— if he
doesn’t win this time, I’ll
need a new meal ticket.”
King may decide not to go
with that last one.

Whatever the promo-
tion, Tyson will be on a
search—and-destroy mis-
sion, ready to knock
Holyfield’s head off. His
handlers won’t take the
fight lightly, and it’s likely
that the training has already
started, starting with film
sessions of last year’s
brawl.

He will take no prison-
ers. He will be mad. He will
train and pray just as hard
as Holyfield, although their
methods in both activities
differ.

Everybody always says
that for $35 million, they’d
step in the ring with the
heavyweight champ and go
for a minute or so. Step into
the ring with Tyson in May
and dangle a world title belt

& Smith Honorable Mention All-
American as quarterback, and he holds
his school’s record for career passing
yardage..In Pitt’s Blue-Gold game this
year, he completed two of ﬁve passes
for 29 yards. His change to wide receiv-

-er came in the spring due to a lack of

depth at the position.

Eugene Blackwell, a defensive
back at Pitt, said he thinks that Murray
is a better quarterback, but Murray does
what the team needs. _

“He was asked to do it, and he did
it. He’s a team player. He’s here more
for the team [than for himself]. He’ll
continue to try to be a quarterback since
that’s what he wants to do. But he’ll do
whatever he’s asked.”

Blackwell also praised the athleti-

 

’  it; mom mo: 9  

cism and enthusiasm Murray brings to
the field.

So how does Murray view his con-
tributions to both sports? In football, he
points the depth he added this past sea-
son to the thin receiving core and his
athleticism.

“I wasn’t happy about changing
positions, but I was asked, and I want to
help the team. I’d like to move back to
quarterback as soon as I can, but I
haven’t spoken to Harris [about moving
back] yet.”

On the hard—court side of things,
Murray wants to work hard in practice
and contribute to making the basketball
team more competitive.

“I concentrate on my defense and
rebounding. The rest is just fun.”
