LA Probation Drops
498 out of 2,928 liberal arts students are on probation
according to [ﬁgures released by Russel A. Dixon, as-

sistant dean of liberal arts. These ﬁgures indicate that slight-
ly over 17 percent of the School of liberal arts students are

on probation.

Dixon classiﬁed these ﬁgures further by stating that 419

students are on their ﬁrst proba-

tion, 66 are on continued pro-
bation, and 13 are on extended

probation.
Dixon explained that many
meanings could be read into

these ﬁgures. He advised stu-
dents to “pay little attention to
them. He went on to explain that
it is difficult to classify the num-
ber of students in eachclass who
are on probation, because stu-
dents are judged by the number
of quality points they have.
The ﬁgures show a decline in
the number of students on pro-
bation when ‘compared with last
year’s winter trimester when 604
‘students’ were on probation, and
with the _ preceeding year when

for the winter trimester.

Dixon accounts for the contin-
ual drop in the number of stu-
dents on probation by 1 saying,
“The students are more selec-
tive and they are trying harder.
This is inaccordance with Chan-
cellor Litchﬁeldfs plan.

“I think great strides have
beenltaken to cut down the num-
ber of students on probation. This
is accomplished ‘partly by more
selectivity’ by the admissions of-
fice.” Dixon stated, “We still
-have »a long way to go, but we
"are rapidly improving our stu-
dent" body in accordance with

become a ﬁrst rate school.”’
‘ Dixon further asserted that the
probation ‘ ﬁgures are "‘certainly’
nothing to be seriously alarmed
about, and concern about them
can be detrimental to the stu-
dents.” ' -
The ﬁgures do not include
transfer students until they-have
completed two trimesters at the

Rested in Florida

After retiring from the Pitts-

went to Florida to rest, but re-
turned to Pittsburgh because his
wife didn’t like the Florida cli-
mate. He then came to work for
the University in November, 1960.

About September, 1961,
Palmer became ill. He cseemed
to recover and worked". the next

members of the University.

In a short time, however, he
was forced to leave work perma-

pital, but was soon taken home.

Wednesday morning, Febru-
ary 5, Palmer died. He was in
his late 50’s. .

Captain Charles Ray, head of
the University Security Depart-
ment, has already felt his loss. He

“Theater 1l” will present ''

Edward.A1bee’s.The Death of

Bessie Smith, W e dn e s d ayl.
through Friday at/ 8:30 ' in 9

1126 CL. According ‘to.Dr.
John H. Ulrich, head of the

.University Theater and director
of the production. _ '. A‘.
“This play has no secret, it is‘
short and highly realistic in con. --
trast to Albee’s usually more‘com- .
plex, surrealistic plays.” The “L”-
shaped stage and seating” areas, '

termed “distributive staging” by.
Dr.

sisted by William Booth.
The play’s eight scenes are per-
formed in various sections of the

stage. Most of the action takes:
place, in a Memphis, Alabama hos;-' 
pital in 1937. Albee, the young
‘ American playwright, himself 

wrote, “The circumstances sur-

rounding the death 'of- Bessie

Smith, the N e gr 0 blues’ singer,
provided the initial stimulus for
the play. . .” '
Berlin Premiere .

The Death of Bessie Smith had
its premiere in Berlin,“ Germany,
in 1960. Last year it_played, off-
Broadway on a bill with- The
American Dream. Albee has an
other play on Broadway now.-

Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf. .

42 tickets for each of the three-
performances will be available

beginning today in 1127 CL on a . A

..Dr. Ulrich regrets “that there

are notlmore tickeas available,
but _the size of the theater

makes it impossible.” It is pos- '

sible however for non-ticket
holders to be admitted because
seats for ticket holders are, only-

“Women: taking over or taken in” is the topic of an open
discussion to be held by Mortar Board on Wednesday from 4
to 6 p.m. in 1228 CL. All interested persons are invited to at-,
tend and contribute their views on the changing aspects. of
women’s role in American society.

Three or four week ago University faculty and admin-

opportunities for

- years to do graduate work. The

committee also wants to publicize
the fact» that these opportunities
existed.

Opinion Needed

Wednesday’s discussion is the
result of the need for campus

take advantage of the opportuni-
ties offered to them.

men either do not realize these
opportunities are offered or else
they are unwilling to utilize
them for psychological reasons
or because of the social pres-

. sures exerted on them to marry

and end a professional career.

‘Helen Poole Rush, dean of
students and member of the com-
mittee, suggested this subject to

Ject. Dean Rush felt that if the
problem was discussed by the
student community, perhaps they
could enlighten the committee.

Answers will be sought to such
questions as: “Have women really.

Asian Dept.
May Add

Japanese

A new department of East Asian

, Languages and Literature in the
' division of the Humanities has
' been added to the three depart-

ments which together‘ replaced the
old Department of Modern Lan-
guages. -

At present, the department of-
fers a number of courses in‘ Chi-
nese and hopes to add Japanese
in a year or so. Eventually Ko-
rean may also be taught. A mas-
ters degree program in Chinese
will begin in the fall.

Undergraduate enrollment has
increased this year, with 30 to
40 students ‘currently taking
courses. _

Through a grant from the U.S.
government, a special section of
the department, the Chinese Lan-
guage and Area Center, has been
established, in which professors
from any department, who are
working on material concerned
with the far east, may coordinate
their efforts. Many of the pro-
fessors are currently employed in
the Social Science division.

The grant, which must. be
renewed periodically, has made
possible the establishment of
more courses and the expansion
of, those already offered. The-
department expectswith each‘
year to have a broader selec-
tion of courses and greater stu-
dent interest, according to Bern-
and S. Adams, assistant to the
dean of Humanities.

The department also‘ assists
other areas of study in devel-
oping course material connected
with the far east.

The chairmen of the four for-
eign language and. literature de-
partments are: Germanic, Dr. J,
Alan Pfeffer; Romance, Dr. Jack
Kolbert; Slavic, Dr. Charles E.
Bidwell; and East Asian, Dr. Y.
T. Yang.

WRITERS
The Pitt Writers Group will
meet tomorrow evening at 7:00

students are invited to attend.

A Music Characterized by Imp rovisalion

  ‘Los Nortenos” Sing

By MORGAN IVIORRISON

Into a humid Student Union
Ballroom, ﬁlled to capacity,
six Columbian steelwor-kérs
marched, strumming some of
the spirit of Columbian folk-
music before a standing audi-
ence. Thus began an entertaining
Odyssey into mos_t all_ of the
native music of Columbia and
some other Latin American folk-
songs by “Los Nortenos” (The,
Northerners).

The music of the “Los Norte-
nos” sextet is characterized by
improvisation and not a ‘formal
style of composed music, i.e.
classical music. Hence, what_em—

-erges is not a rigid form, but one
in which almost complete freedom ' .

as to what is to be included in
the piece is to be given to the
player.
_ Virtually Eliminates

This quality of folkmusic virtu-
ally eliminates the need for-writ-
ten. music, theory lessons, ,‘and’
formalized training in music. The
resulting .product requires only
good to excellent instrumental
techniques and a “good car” for

Folkmusic then becomes"
something in which ‘practically
everyone can participate and
from which a great deal of- s"at- :~
isfaction can be derived. Per-
haps the popularity of folk-
music rests. mainly upon" this
base. V
Columbian-folk music is _the pro-
duct of the amalgamation of an
Iberian musical tradition into_ a‘

cultural ‘complex, of which -the

music is but a small part. The
Iberian portion of this music
might’ be identiﬁed by a melan-
cholic sense "upon which_ the play-
ers build songs which are still
optimistic and unrestricted.
The geography of Columbia

might. also be cited inthe devel--
‘opment ofthe diverse ‘forms of the

music, ;for,_. amid the "mountain
communities, cultural islands are
prone to evolve their own brand
of folkmusic within the Columbian
manifold.
_ " Forms Include

In the Altiplano or mountain
regions, principal forms include
the Ba-mbuco and Pasillo song-
dance. The Joropo of the Ilano

region and the Paseo of _the costa,

or costal region constituted some

of the examples which the North—' L

erners played. Two of these dances
were demonstrated by Columbian
students, adding a ﬁnal touch
which the ‘imagination could not
supply.

The basic pattern of all of the
selections player was one of
singer alone, instruments and
singers, and’ then both together
a solo tutti, together plan, as. it
were. Intricate rhythms and
variable system_ of rhythm in a
single piece determined into
what class of pieces the selec-
tion belonged. " ‘

Instrumentation of the group
included the guitarra requinto a

"_*But Oh! That Beano!

I Editor, The Pitt News:

.We can accept losing the bas-
ketball game to West Virginia
last Saturday night, but when
it comes to accepting the after-
game remarks to a television
audience made by Pitt’s pub-
Cook, we

‘It may be that we are trying
to stress an insigniﬁcant point,

I‘ but we feel.-that we arcn’t.

Briefly, Mr. Cook informed

the television v i e w e r s that

West Virginia had a better team

'-_ and‘ deserved to win. We are
.- sure that many of our fellow
 students would dispute such,a

statement.

At half time Mr. Cook said
that Cal Sheffield was the only

A Pitt player capable of bringing
‘the ball

up from the back
E:ourt. May we remind him that
Dave Roman and Tim Grgurich
also play for Pitt.

Not taking anything from the
ﬁne game played by the whole
team, it could be seen that the
team didn’t have a chance to
win without Roman. But why
doesn’t Dave receive the pub-
licity that's due him?

We feel that Dave has the
abilities of a gr-‘eat basketball

player, but when is Mr. Cook
going to realize this?

In the past The Pitt'News has
given Roman a “fair deal”, and
we trust will do likewise in the
future. Howeyer, for Dave to
get any statewide or national
recognition, Mr. Cook will have
to give his support. What do yo
say, Beano? , I

We note that Mr. Martin A.

At the far end multi-colored’ construction paper
and hoxes of 48 crayolas, more manilla and giant
sheets of newsprint, boxes of ‘ - ,

The setting itself was concurrent with a thou‘-

olds were different. For some on small white pine-
iron tubing chairs hadcrutches leaning beside them

This was the Home for Crippled Children

Diane sat down with me to learn a number
game. She tried to put the blocks together, not with
one hand on either side of the two blocks, but with
her arms crossed and the force exerted by the out-
side of her hands like squeezing tongs. Scars ran

down this side of her arms. Her hands had been ‘

bent back this way at birth, her teacher,.Miss ‘Orr,
told us later. Doctors could strengthen the muscle
on that side somewhat with an -operation but on
theinside, her thumbs curl to her palm. She exer-
cises, though. She smiled at me as she did when I
ﬁrst walked in. -

“Stupid. Ah, am I‘ stupid!” she laughed. I want-

ed to cry but I smiled and said, “Come, on Diane.
You’re doing. ﬁne.” She counted -the blocks, her

‘ﬁnger tapping theplastic, her eyes on my face.

"One, two, tree, four, ﬁve, sik, seben. That’s all.”
She hadn’t lo'oked,at the blocks or moved her ﬁnger.

Movies at the Dorms . ..

By Josey Grossman

It was unreal. A therapist in a side room was
working with a baby. Black hair lay limp on its
swollen head; saliva dripped from its gaping mouth.
She tried to sit it up. The head lolled from a spine
of rubber; arms and legs hung senseless. It rolled
to the cot, its eyes sliding to ﬁnd its mother’s face.

No, this child isn’t human. No. I wanted to get

out of there. No. A blond towhead that could have;‘s~

been my brother peered at me, one eye crossed,’
through glasses. I

“Hi- I’m Mike. Miss Orr said you’ll play the
number game .'.with me. I can‘ do it quick. I’m the
smartest one here.” . i «

He dragged his left leg as he moved to the
table to sit down. .

“Hey, you know'my twin? That’s Ann. The one
in the wheel chair.‘ The other one’s Gail.”

Ann’s strawbe'rry—blond curls bounced over a
beautiful I freckled face. Her braced legs stuck
straight out, paralyzed with a more severe case of
cerebral palsy than her brother’s, Miss Orr had
explained. Gail, another pretty blond with a square
head too large for her short body, beamed dumbly.\
Gail isa dwarf.

Not Little Enough

Mike’ pounded the table. “Hey, look. This tray
holds how many. I am—fivel” He spread his ﬁngers
wide. “Then this "tray is for Mary Alicia-— she’s

three. And this one for Robbie —— he’s two. And ,,_/._,'v

I guess there’s not one little enough for Nancy‘
Ann. She wasjust horned.”

“Is that all the children in your family?’-? I
prayed. Five children. Two with cerebral palsy.

,“No. I have a big brother John. But he plays
basketball all the time.”

I closed my eyes. .

The bell rang. Time to leave. “Say good-bye to

_the girls, children.” Miss Orr srniled.;The children‘

waved. Diane’s forehead wrinkledvand she did not
smile. Little. Gail grinned broadly. Mike wiggled
his nose. “You’s' better come back.” Miss Orr thank-
ed us. The circles under her eyes ’were dark; her
smile was grateful. '  —

“The children‘ loved having you here. Could you
find time to come back?’ "I know you’re busy. Do
you havefriends ‘who might be interested? Any
time — we’re always here.” _

With 20 children, one new volunteer had come

Two weeks ago there was presented on tele-
vision a rerun'of the movie version of Nevil Shute’s
credible novel of the end of. the world, On The
Beach. Many people with whom I had come into
contact in the few days prior to
the showingremarked that they

remarkable displayof good taste
on the part of Pitt students be-»
cause at the time of itsoriginal
release the moviehad been bill-
ed, and rightly so, as one that

It was, therefore, with a
goodly bit" of anticipation that l
and a few friends traveled to the 
Holland Hall lounge on that Sunday night, settled

 

ourselves in a number of unoccupied seats, and
_\ 4

prepared to enjoy the movie.

Wearied of‘ Dropping

By the time the feature started, the lounge was
ﬁlled to capacity and some students even had to go
to their rooms and bring up chairs so that they
could sit down. Although most of the students had
come speciﬁcally toisee On_ the Beach, there were
,a few who, apparently having wearied of dropping
water-bags onstrolling policemen and short—sheet-
ing their roommates’ beds, had managed to corral
a number of choice front and second row seats.

-I am not sure whether they were disappointed
at not being permitted to watch a feature—length
Donald Duck which was advertised for the same
time slot, or whether they thought 07!» the Beach
was a sex—epic of the same school as some of the
early Brigitte Bardot thrillers, but as soon as a

on a purely sensual basis.
Why No'l' Kick?

I certainlydo not mean that the majority of

viewers were content with the behavior of _the_§_,ﬂv4

ﬁlthy-mouthed ones, but all requests for silence’
were disregarded with contempt, and outside of a
sharp kick in the sweetbreads there seemed no
possible way to arrest their inconsideration. /1

Two ofthe students who were with me watch-
ing’ the movie were visitors from an ivy—league
school in the east, and one of them remarked after-
wards that it appeared Pitt was producing per— ‘
verts instead of men, and I could not help’ thinking
that there was much truth in what he said. Possibly
not about the pervert "part, for that was a rather
strong statement to make concerning the actions
of those individuals, and if. they are abnormal in
any respect, it is an abnormality of mental and
social development.

In any case, if they are not perverts, they cer-
tainly are not'm'en, or‘ at least not men of the ilk
that a respectable university would wish to have on

‘to be an iiistitution which takes high school stu-

If one were to judge according
to the length and vigor of ap-
plause received, Alpha Epsilon Phi
sorority would appear to be the
winner of the 1963 Greek Sing
presented in Carnegie Music Hall
last Wednesday night. The girls
turned in a well-done and ex-
citing performance of “The Tele-
phone Song,” from the Broadway
show Bye-Bye Birdie. ’

Happily, however, the audience
did not reserve its. applause solely
for the AEPhis. And, also happily,
the AEPhis didn’t present the only
exciting and well-done perform-
ance of ‘the evening. Pi Lambda
Phi combined the . power of
masculine voices with appropriate
costuming and humorous mood" in
acolorful and funny rendition of
“Sit Down, You’re Rocking the
Boat" from Guys‘ and Dolls.

The theme of the Sing was-

Greek Sing Colorful, Exciting‘

“Songs from Broadway Shows
Between 1950 and 60,” a well
chosen theme since it provided
opportunities for the color, humor
and occasional acting which made
the program interesting. At times,
however, the Sing looked ‘like a
celebration of the Chinese New

-Year since four sororities, Chi

Omega, Kappa Alpha Theta, Sig-
ma Delta Tau, and Zeta Tau Al-
pha, chose songs from Rodgers
and Hammerstein’s Flower Drum
Song — “I enjoy Being a Girl,”
“Grant Avenue,” “Chop Suey,”
and “Fan Tan Fanny” respective-
ly. A
Unfortunately, some of the
groups did not measure up to
advance expectations. Alpha Phi

' Alpha, the winner 9f the 1962

Greek Sing, and composed ‘of-
some of the ﬁnest individual
voices in the ‘Greek system, fail-
ed to "put over “A Little Tin
Box” from Fiorello with suffi-
cient power. A
It would be difficult to ﬁx the
blame on ‘any one factor, but it
seemed that the Alpha’s might
have done better had they not
s_plit up the group into three parts,
only two of which sang — and
sang separate parts at that, so
that only four men sang ‘at any

.l*

one time except during the chorus
of the song.

Delta Sigma Phl‘s arrangement:
of “Kansas City” from Oklahoma

also fell like a clay kreplach, be-
cause the group seemed unprepar-
ed, and indeed performed much
later in the'program than they
were scheduled.
The women of Alpha Kappa
Alpha, however, departed from
' the usual “chorus line” position-
ing and" provided an air of
sophistication with their presen-
'tation of “C’est M-agniﬁque”
from Can—Can. _
Phi Epsilon Pi probably ‘reach-
ed the highest degree of power
;during the evening with “Shalom”
from Milk and Honey. The Phi‘
Eps sang loud and sang together,
and performed well, even though
they had chosen a diﬁicult song to
do.
. The program as a whole was
entertaining and colorful, but the
most important aspect was that
the Greeks obviously had a great
deal of fun putting it‘ on. It would
seem a shame to judge the parti-
cipants on purely musical grounds

because, though in many places.

not amateurish, the show was an
amateur one, and a great deal of
technical proﬁciency cannot be

expected.

that the records were donated
-to promote the radio station.

, Mrs. Helen F. Dice, assistant
Alldred Room librarian, stated
that although they had not had
sutﬁcienttime to fully evaluate
the collection, she thought it
was a “pretty comprehensive col-
lection.”

Mrs. Dice‘ announced that the
records would be available for
circulation.

The records are largely a se-
lection of French classical music.

Mrs. Dice stated that the Alld-
red Room was glad to receive
the recordings: “They represent

7 V a long period of French music”.

Although the records are mostly
"classical, a few are folk songs
and modern semi-popular music,”
she added.

It has been said that Dr. Pei,‘

     
 
 
 

Ira Palmer Dies;
Students, Police
Saddened by Loss,

(Continued from Page 1)

proclaimed him “a good man, a
nice man to work with. He was
well liked in_ the University by
students and administrators. He
was dependable at the job he was
supposed to be doing.” Dan Alex-
ander added that “the one big
thing is that he was interested in
the students.”

In an interview for The Pitt
News in May, 1961, Palmer- said
that his job at the University
was the “best job he ever had.”
When asked about his feelings
towards the students,‘he replied‘,
“I never have any trouble with
any of them, in fact, I have fun
with them.”

And the students loved Palmer
as much as he seemed to love
them. Bill Schneider, E&M senior,
recalled that “I’ve known him for
four years and I’ve never known a
person who could make as many
friends as he did as easily as he
could.”

Joel Filner, LA senior, noted
that “you could write eulogy after
eulogy after eulogy, and you could
never get any more of a person
than he was.” r

  

The policeman who was on

duty when a student was slugged
at last Friday’s Student Union
Board dance, didn’t know a ﬁght
had occurred until he ‘was ques-
tioned about it Monday.

“I did ask one boy who. was
bothering a girl to leave,” said
Jim Cronin, University policeman.
He was posted outside the SU
Ballroom and no one said any-
thing about a ﬁght to him.

“I ‘remember seeing a boy with

Fight at SU‘Dance Unreported

a scar on his lip come out of
the dance, but it didn’t look like
a fresh one, so I didn’t stop him,”
Cronin explained.

The student was punched in the
face by one of three youths who
stepped between him and the girl
he was dancing with.

He was taken to University-
Presbyterian Hospital. Oﬂicials
there reported that stitches were
used to close a laceration on his
lip.

Public Opinion
Polled on US.

i s Diplomats

Richard D. Kleman, a Uni-
versity g ra d u a t e, recently
conducted a poll to learn the

opinions of members of the 4

Pittsburgh community con-

rcerning the U.S. Foreign Ser-
"“"’..;vice.

Kleman, conducting the poll for
a research paper required for a
course in diplomacy at the Grad-
uate School of Public and Inter-
nationa- Affairs, interviewed 100
people in Beechview, Brookline,
and Dormont. His goal was to get
a “middle-class” attitude toward
the U. S. Foreign Service.

, Four—day Period

The poll was concerned over a
four-day period. Sixteen ques-
tions were asked — six of which
dealt with income and education
of the" interviewees. Results of
the interview were compiled

through use of an IBM machine.j

“‘A large percentage in the
upper income and education
group bad faith in American
diplomats’ qualiﬁcations to deal
with the Soviet,” Mr. Klema-n

said, “and the faith grew as
education and income dimin-
ished.”

Of the group interviewed, 73
per cent believed a well-educated
and intelligent person would want
to become an American diplomat,
but a large part of the group
didn’t recognize U. S. Foreign
Service officers as part of Ameri-
can diplomacy.

Want Diplomat Children

About 75 per cent of those on
the lower end of the ‘income and

- education scale desired "diplomatic

careers for their children, while
53 per cent on the upper end of
the scale expressed such opinion.
When asked who the Secre-
is, six persons
named Dean Acheson, six chose
John Foster Dulles, and one ._
named Robert Kennedy. .

45 persons knew Adlai Steven-
son is U. S. Ambassador to the
United Nations. Recognition of
other ambassadors was negligible.

PH S Advisory

if Staff Members

Two Pittsburgh physicians,
'Dr. Herbert R.Domke and Dr.

Cecil Sheps, are members of}
"the permanent advisory group

to the Community Health§N00" — M'='SS- H-C
iNoon —— Midday Series.

l

T h is Advisory Committee on .~

‘Service.

Community Health Services, made
up ‘of leaders experienced in
health administration, medical re-
search. and related health fields,
will advise Surgeon General
Luther L. Terry of the Public
’Health Service on ways to apply
research results.

Look to Group for Leadership

Dr. Terry maintains that “The
Public Health Services will look
to this distinguished group, re-
presenting a great diversity of»
interests and skills, for advice and
leadership as we seek to stimulate
the development of comprehensive
health services in every commu-
'nity."

V In stressing the importance

_of this new advisory group, Dr.
Terry noted that Public Health

_ Services activities related to
Community health programs
have grown and diversiﬁed rap-
idly in recent 'years.

He observed that “the effective
delivery of health services, where
and when people need them, is
one of the great challenges of the
next decade. Many thousands of
people will live longer and have
more productive lives if we can

cal knowledge aailable to us.”
Prompt Application .

Dr. Sheps also pointed out that
the prompt application of new
knowledge can save thousands of
lives in the next decade.

Dr. Domke commented on the
time
new medicines and their general
.use. He indicated that “The time
lag between the discovery of new

and their use by health depart-
ments. hospitals, and physicians is
a matter of real concern.

“This Advisory Committee on
Community Health Services will
spell out ways to apply research
results so that the general pub-
lic may benefit from them
promptly and safely."

Dr. Domke is the director of the
Allegheny County Health Depart-
ment. Dr. Sheps is a professor of
medical and hospital administra-
tion of the Graduate School of
Public Health at the University.

The committee, whose ﬁrst
meeting will be in Washington,

- D.C. on February 7 and 8, replaces
an ad hoc committee which has
been advising the Public Health
Service on community health
grants.

Cigar—chewing Harry Litwack, the basketball court’s
answer to the philosophical Harry Golden, was in town this
weekend to scout the Panther basketball team which will
meet his Temple team in the Philadelphia Palestra on Feb-

Litwack, long recognized as one of the nation’s ﬁnest
coaches, was the half-time guest on WPGH’s game broad-
cast of the Westminstergame.

“This is a ﬁne ball club you’ve got here,” opined
Litwack. “It’s as, ﬁne as any I’ve seen so far in the East.
You’re bigger and faster than us. _

“We knew before I came here that Pitt has on outstand-
ing ballclub this year. Their record will tell you that. You’re

club should get some sort of an invitation to a tournament._”_

Lifwack Likes Depth

Litwack was impressed with the physical make—up’ of the
Panthers. “You’ve got lots of depth,” he said. _“The scorinig
punch seems to improve when you go to your bench. The

‘ ballclub runs well and can hit from outside. Pittsburgh has

‘V

always given us strong opposition and I wish them luck the

When the basketball team was waiting to depart from
Greater Pittsburgh Airport a few weeks ago, Calvin Sheffield

got in‘ a gab-session with Bill "Russell of the Boston Celtics,

who were on a transfer stop-over.
When Sheffield returned to his teammates’ company,
Brian Generalovich asked him, “What were you doing,
Cal? Teaching Russell some of the ﬁne arts of/_ defense?”

Teddy Lazzaro is a freshman basketball- player who is
5-foot 3., He takes a thousand steps. to "get from one basket to
the other and he looks like\Mickey Rooney. in quicksand.
Too Small for Sport’

Lazzaro can’t help it he is: small, but one area high school
coach exclaimed, “He wouldn’t even get "a uniform to tryout

for my team.” It’s like‘ letting an 88-pounder play football.
Lazzaro, who has no inhibitions about slapping guys _
on the rear all the time and possesses high-pitched vocal
chords, is naturally the leader of the frosh team. He also
provides amusing moments forvthe fans.

“What is this — one of Bill Veeck’s tricks?” cried Oak-
land’s Joe Scalise at th‘e Arena the other night. His reference
was to the time that Veeck, a zany major league baseball
owner, sent a midget to bat a few yearsago. He-promptly

drew a walk. Shortly, midgets were banned from play.

tersonttraded positions in a pair
of 1-2 ﬁnishes in the dashes and
both were in on the ﬁnal 400-
yard freestyle relay win.’

Ron Levine overcame a slight
Syracuse lead on the thirdlleg of
the 400-yard medley relay to posi-
tion his team for a win. He later
won the 200-yard butterfly. Rob
Levine took a ﬁrst in the 200-yard
backstroke and anchored the 400-

El Coleman and Wayne Lund
swept the diving competition
which gave the winners a strong

Navy Gymnastsl Tie Winless
Panthers in Last Event

By ‘MARVIN ZELOWITZ

Navy gymnasts Larry Sil-

the Panthers’ hopes for their
ﬁrst victory at Fitzgerald
Field House on Saturday as
they took ﬁrst and second,
respectively, in the ﬁnal event——
the still rings-—to tie the meet,
48-48.

of 3500 school safety guards saw
the Panthers lose a_ 38-26 edge

gyrations on the. horizontal bar.

The Panthers still needed_ only

only good enough for a ﬁfth, and

‘Panthers Outrun Titans
In Runaway, 72-556

. By AL BLUMKIN
Rebounding from last week’s heartbreaking loss to West
Virginia, the Panther cagers moved two steps closer to gain-
ing a post-season ‘tournament bid with easy victories over

‘Westminster and Fordham.

' Coach Johnny Bach of Fordham, a member of the NIT
selection committee. stated that the Panthers “have a good

solid ball club, one that we wouldO

like, but we can’t send invita-
tions until February 18.”

Paced by hot shooting by Brian
Generalovich, Dave- Roman, and
Dave Sauer, the Panthers de-
feated Westminster for the sec-
ond time this season, with a
relatively easy '72-55 victory last
Saturday. . ‘

General Leads

‘Generalovich, with ten of his
16 points, coming in the ﬁrst
half, led the way in the early
stages as the Cats opened up a

. nine point lead at the half. Ro-

man and Sauer picked up where
the General left off, scoring most
of their points in the second half.

By BOB SMIZIK

When the Panther wrest-

’ ling team faces Lehigh Satur-
day night it will be the first
’ time in the last three years
that the match was not to

 determine the top dual-meet

team in the East.
That honor goes to Syracuse

in S‘-this year. The Orange have swept

 through their first six dual meets
including 24-’? and 23-6‘ defats of
‘Pitt and Lehigh respectively.
The Orange have an extreme-
’ ly well-balanced team led byitwo
sophomores and two seniors. The
sophomores, a pair of football
players, heavyweight Jim Nance
-‘and 191—pounder Gerry Everl-
ing, are both undefeated.
Tied By Panthers
The ‘seniors are 130-pounder
Bethel Greenhalgh and 167-
pounder Gary Sirota. The only
blemish on G1-eenhalgh’s record
is a tie by Mike Johnsongwhich
is no disgrace. Sirota has been
tied by Jim Harison and beaten
by Army’s Mike Natvig, 1-0. '
' These four represent Syracuse’s
main hopes of winning the East-
ern Tournament championship
March 8-9.
