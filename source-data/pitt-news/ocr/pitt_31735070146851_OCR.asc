Pitt to offer
additional  
Arabic

  dialect

Katherine Sandler

One of the University’s smallest language de-
partments, which emphasizes student initia-
tive and student-driven expansion, has grown
once again.

The Less—Commonly-Taught Languages
Center will offer a new course on the Ara-
bic dialect Levantine for the ﬁrst time at Pitt
next semester. The Spring 2011 semester will
also mark the second semester of Icelandic
at Pitt. ‘ i

Native speakers of the wide‘ variety of lan-
guages, as well as students with aspeciﬁc focus
in each language’s region, enroll in these less
popular language courses.

“The goal of LCTL‘is to represent diversity,”
said Claude Mauk, director of the center. “We
try to offer a distribution of languages, like
Quechua from South America and Swahili from
Africa.” _

The entire program is about half the size of
other language departments at Pitt. The Levan-
tine class has a ﬁill enrollment of 16. students
and will likely be part of an almost—ﬁnalized
Arabic Certiﬁcate program, although the pro-
gram still needs approval from the provost of-
ﬁce. The dialectis spokeninsyria, Lebanon, the
Palestinian territories and parts ofjordan.

The minimum number of students in an
Arts and Sciences class is 14, but classes as
small as one student can be offered at Pitt as
long as the instructor meets requirements,
Mauk said.

Win and you’re in.

That’s been the case for the Pitt foot-
ball team the past three seasons when it
came to winning the Big East Champion-
ship and going toga BCS bowl game.

In each season they controlled their
own destiny to win the league title, but
a late slip-up either prevented that from
happening or, as is the case this year,
put their title hopes pretty much out
of reach.

Though the Panthers can still sneak
into a BCS game this year, a berth is high-
ly unlikely. After losing to West Virginia
35-10 on Friday afternoon, Pitt will have
to win against Cincinnati and hope West
Virginia and Connecticut both lose in
their season ﬁnales.

“It’s very disappointing because we
felt like the last three seasons, that we
controlled our own destiny and we let it
slip away,” junior defensive tackle Chas
Alecxih said after the game.

Two years ago, the Panthers traveled
to Cincinnati where a win against the
Bearcats and in their next two Big East
games would’ve given them the Big East
Championship, but it didn’t happen.

Last year, the Panthers tried to return
the favor to Cincinnati by beating them
in a winner—takes—all game in the regular
season finale, but lost in a narrow 45-44
defeat. _

Then came this season, in which the
Panthers shot out to a two—game confer-
ence lead with just four. games left, but

Port Authority to cut busroutes, hike fares

Michael Macagnone
News Editor

As many as one third of the Port Authority
of Allegheny County’s'bus routes will not
run come March 13, and other routes will
be significantly cut.

The authority’s Board of Directors vot-
ed on Wednesday to cut about 45 routes
from its. service and reduce service on
other routes. It also voted to increase
fares injanuary. A news release on the or-
ganization’s website cited a sharp drop in
state funding as the reason for the cuts.

' U

According to the Port Authority web-
site, some routes, like the 71A Negly, will
have reduced service on all days. Others,
like the 64 Lawrenceville-Waterfront or
the 46D Curry, will have reduced or no
service on weekends.

Many communities, including Liberty,
East McKeesport and Marshall, as well as
the Robinson Town Center, will lose ser-
vice entirely. Others, like Mt. Washington
and Trafford, will lose weekend service.

The Port Authority projected a deficit
of more than $40 million in its annual
operating budget without the cuts. The

deﬁcit came from afailure of the state to
fundthe Port Authority’s budget, accord’-

ing to the organization’s budget dojcu-T j

ments available online. . 

Act 44, the state transportation fund-
ing bill, originally included revenue from
tolling I-80, which was not approved by
the Federal Highway Administration.
Since that plan fellthrough, the state
has not increased fundingto the Port
Authority. ,

The operating budget shortfall came
separate from aprevious boon in the au-
thority’s capitalbudget early last month.

A federal transportation grant will allow

the Port Authority to buy more than 50 ‘

new buses.

The $22 million grant from the De- .'

partment of Transportation was part of
a federal program to provide funds to
more than 150 transportation authorities
nationwide.

The University requires an instructor to be

smashing the windows of two Oakland

Police found 13 smashed windows at

Everyone ran when the police arrived,

EDITORIAL

Celeb campaign narcissistic

When you see advertisements of your favor-
ite celebrities in coiﬁns, don’t panic. The ad-
vertisements are meant to signify the celeb’s
digital deaths as part of a new campaign called
Digital Life Sacriﬁce.

According to the Associated Press, enter-
tainers like Alicia Keys, Lady Gaga,]ustin Tim-
berlake and Ryan Seacrest will sign off social
media platforms like Facebook and Twitter
on Tuesday — World AIDS Day. They will sign
back on when the campaign has raised $1 mil-
lion for Keys’ Keep a Child Alive charity.

To us, the Digital Life Sacriﬁce campaign
comes off as very narcissistic. We wouldn’t
bank on raising money by refusing to print
The Pitt News until we came up with $1 mil-
lion, but the Hollywoodstars are convinced
that their fans will greatly mourn the loss of

their life-changing Tweets.

It seems interesting that the celebs are ask-
ing their fans to donate money when they could
just as easily come up with it themselves. For
example, Lady Gaga hasa net worth of $60 mil-
lion,justin Timberlake of $70 million and Ryan
Seacrest of $75 million, according to celebri-
ty_networth.com. Although we acknowledge
that many celebrities donate to charities, this
campaign in particular makes celebrities look

like they are forcing their fans to donate.

In addition, the Digital Life Sacriﬁce doesn’t
seem likely to provide continued support for
the HIV/AIDS victims because it puts the focus
on the celebrities and not on the issues. People
aren’t going to donate money because of the
severity of the AIDS epidemic, but they will
because they care about what their favorite
stars are Tweeting.

Leigh Blake, the president and co—founder

of Keep a Child Alive, told the Associated Press, V

“We’re trying to sort of make the remark: Why
do we care so much about the death of one
celebrity as opposed to millions and mil-
lions of people dying in the place that we’re
all from?”

We deﬁnitely don’t get this message from
the upcoming Digital Life Sacriﬁce campaign.
In fact, we think it says the opposite. After all,
if you really care about supporting HIV/AIDS
victims, you probably don’t need prompting
from a celebrity to donate. And those who
do need prompting to donate are just celeb-
obsessed.

In the end, we wonder if Perez Hilton will
end up donating the entire million himself.
After all, his job depends on the lifestyles of
the rich and famous.

MOUSTAOHE COLUMN OF AMERICA

 
 

Oliver Bateman
Columnist

In a recent issue of Men’s Fitness, television
mega-celebrity Mike “The Situation” Sorren-

, tino offered eight hot tips for developing a body

like his. Given that “The Situation” has aturkey
neck, a hairless upper torso and nonexistent
shoulder muscles, it is unclear why such a body
would amount to a desideratum for anyone.
Nevertheless, he got to co—author a column
in one of America’s most popular periodicals.
Since dispensing advice is our metier, we’ve
decided to prepare a set of health tips for im-
poverished college students who can’t afford
the glossy, colorful magazines that are sold at
places like CVS and Rite Aid.

First, you must limit your carb consump-
tion. Carbs are your enemy, and they’re hiding
everywhere. That candy bar you love so much?
Thousands of carbs. That ranch dressing-satu-
rated side salad you used to buy at the Wendy’s
on Fifth Avenue before that Wendy’s closed?
Incalculable carbs. Even air has some carbs in
it, which is why you’ll want to breathe sparingly
and use nose strips whenever and wherever
possible —— FYI, this is why you see so many
NFL players wearing those: They’re worried

about eating too many life—tl1reatening carbs.

Another thing you need to do is eat plenty of
omegas. Omegas contain lots of health —— way
more health than carbs or sugars — and they’re
often mentioned on Oprah’s television show.
One way you can get omegas is through nuts,
which are sold exclusively at Starbucks. Their
nut monopoly isone of the reasons there are
so many Starbucks in the United States — an
unalterable fact of life that hot college comedi-
answill never tire of laughing about. .
4 The blue group — which includes blueber-
ries, blueberry juice and blueberry-ﬂavored
Koo_l-Aid ——' is a great source of good stuff.
According to research we might have seen
somewhere, there are antioxidants in these
products. What antioxidants do is assist in the
war against oxidants, a struggle that has raged
inside‘ your body since before you born. With
enough antioxidants, you’ll be ready to take
your health stardom to the next level,

It’s possible that doctors have said that small
meals are better than big ones, so you should
focus on havingbetweenls and 20 “quick bites”
per day. A good way to keep track of this is to
individually bag15 grapes, wriljnga number on
each bag. After you’ve done that, eat the bagged
grapes in numerical order. Between each meal,
consume a gallon of water. This might seem

Health tips for impoverished college

like a lot, but do the math: The earth is nearly
75 percent water and your body is 98.6 percent
water. In other words, you’ve got a lot of H20
drinking ahead of you.

After you’ve started eating right, you should
focus on getting lots sleep. Fortunately for your
purposes, college is the best place to do it. A
good average is around 14 hours per night,
and although that might seem like a lot, don’t
tell us you can’t ﬁt it into your busy schedule.
One way you can get around the problem is to
create your own vacation. If you have classes
on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday
but choose notto go to them, you’ve created a
new holiday. Not only is this a healthy trick, but
it’s great ﬁin, too. Unlike in high school, where
some crusty principal will track you down a la
Edward Rooney in “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off,”
your friendly neighborhood profs couldn’t care
less if you take some time off duringyour college
career. Besides, you’re paying for it, right?

Finally, you can’t reach optimal health with-
out exercise. According to TV and the lntemet,
the most important body parts are the arms
and the abdominal muscles. You’ll need huge
“guns” if you’re a swoll bro on the prowl and
thin, toned arms if you’re trying to look as classy
as our First Lady. Abdominals come in handy

whenyou’retryingtowearyourmidriffibaring _

students

shirts with your low—rise jeans.

A great exercise for the abdominals is the
crunch. To do a crunch, lie down ﬂat on the
ground and bend forward afraction of an inch.
Do several thousand of these and you’ll be sure
to feel the burn. One thing you’ll want to avoid
is the sit-up, which uses a ﬁill range of motion
and can make your stomach feel sore. You can
tone your biceps with a wide variety of “As
Seen on TV” products, rangingfrom adjustable
dumbbells — available for the low, low price of
$5,999 — to high-intensity Shake Weights that
target all of those hard—to—reach areas.

As Mike “The Situation” Sorrentino made
clear in his best—selling column, your health
comes ﬁrst. It certainly doesn’t come second or
third, and there’s no way on earth you can live
without it. College is atough time for everybody,
but that doesn’t mean you can’t achieve the
body of your dreams. Once you’ve got such great
health, you’ll never need anything else.

where else. Go to moustacheclubofamerica.

A MIDWESTERN PIECE

Ireland causes concern forthe euro-

Mark Kozlowski
Columnist

 

If your house were to catch ﬁre, you would
hope that somebody would be there to put it
out. But let’s say that before the ﬁre brigade
agrees to provide its services, it applies all
sorts of conditions: every time you want
to have a candlelit dinner, you can only do
so with the permission and strict supervi-
sion of the ﬁrehouse. Whenever you hold a

"party, you have to charge people to come

in. Your ﬁrst child must be named Dweezil
Moon Unit, and your second child Ethelred
Hoobert Heever, regardless of gender. You’d
likely get all huffy about your sovereignty.
Well, the Republic of Ireland is getting
huﬂ"y about its sovereignty right as it is fac-
ing a serious economic conﬂagration. Irish
banks were apparently just as bad at mak-
ing loans as American banks and were also
very good at getting credit from foreign
countries in the eurozone and elsewhere.
If the Irish banks collapse, they might take
down a lot of other institutions with them.
The Irish government has tried to intervene
with a TARP-like program, or “tarpéil” if
you will, but unfortunately not only were
the Irish banks too big to fail, they were

too big to bail out. The Irish budget deﬁcit
is expected to reach 32 percent of gross
domestic product. That’s just the deﬁcit,
not the entire budget. This is a big, scary
number to a lot of investors, who wonder if
they’ll get their money back. So, something
worse than a bank collapse is in the cards
— a collapse of the entire ﬁscal situation
of the government.

The European Union — with a hearty
“Faugh a Ballagh!” — has essentially forced
Ireland to take an EU bailout that will likely
involve the IMF as well. As a condition of
this bailout, the EU is likely to demand that
Ireland meet certain stipulations — most
controversially, that it raise its ultra—low
12.5 percent corporate tax rate that many

saw askey to the suc_cess ‘of the “Celtic Ti- _ I

ger” years. . _ ~
Of course, thislis an unfortunate Act II of
what started as a Greek tragedy this sum-

,mer, with Greece in hock up to its eyeballs.

Now, worries are mounting because we don’t
know how many acts there are in this play.
Act III might be investors ﬂeeing Portugal,
Act IV might be running away from Pam-
plona and anything else having to do with
Spain, Act V might be a similar run from
Italy. A failed debt auction in Spain would be
almost too large for the EU to handle. Seri-
ous concerns are being expressed about the

euro, and it is doubtful that it can survive as
a single currency in its present form.

The Germans and the French are al-
ready quite grumpy about having bailed

out Greece, especially because the Germans’

have prided themselves on ﬁscal sanity. If
more bailouts are required, the German
people might put increasingpressure on
the German government to reevaluate use
of the euro. If the eurozone loses Germany,
the game’s up, as Germany is the eurozone’s
largest economy and thus its most relevant
member. The euro might be consignedto ir-
relevance. This would suck, but at least the
“mark” would be back in circulation.
There is also a real danger of troubled

_ governments deciding that bailout condi-

tions are too onerous to accept, yet there

, are few ways of getting out of sovereignidebt‘
‘ jams aside Afromrbailouts or default; The 
_ little trick that could be tried here would

be to establish your own currency, print as

much of it as you want and pay off the debts A

with the new legal tender. This has obvious
disadvantages, like having to pay higher
interest rates on sovereign debt.

But with these interest rates already ris-
ing for the troubled eurozone periphery,
some politicians might ﬁgure theyhave rela-
tively little to lose. And in Greece especially,
where a segment of the population is liter-

ally throwing rocks over austerity measures
and hating the Germans for demanding
them, there could be future pressure to exit
the eurozone.

Other EU nations not on the Euro, such
as Poland, might also wonder if surrender-
ing control of their monetary policy to the
European Central Bank is really worth it. In

Poland especially, it is possible that the euro

will be voted down by a public in which Ger-
manophobia is a persistent ‘— and consider-
ing Poland’s history, not necessarily unfair
—— characteristic. Other nations might delay
joining the currency bloc as long as possible
— note that Britain is looking clever for not

, joining the single currency.

This is unfortunate as the euro has had

A some good effects in Europe. It’s made

tourism much easier, cross—border ﬂows of
goods and capital much simpler, and it was

_ much more straightforward to ﬁgure out a

bill for 3.50 euro than for 6776.90 Italian
lira when I went to Italy this summer. But
the seriouscracks in the euro might lead to
its eventual disintegration, much to every-
body’s chagrin. Europe needs to do what it
can to restore conﬁdence in Portugal, Spain
and Italy. If the Irish bailout doesn’t work

ALBUM REVIEW

 

Kanye measures up to ego

Andy Tybout
. Assistant A£rE Editor

My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy
Kanye West

Def Jam . .i

Rocks like: Hip-hop from another
universe
A-

Kanye West’s latest album is not, as he
claimed in August, a masterpiece in
contention with the pyramids. It does,
however, tower above the current hip-
hop landscape. ' , 

Despite the unanimous critical ac-
claim it’s garnered over the past couple of
weeks — including Pitchfork’s first non-
reissue 10.0 rating since Wilco’s Yankee
Hotel Foxtrot — West’s new record, titled
(deep breath) My Beautiful Dark Twisted
Fantasy, falls short of being a flawless
work. Even so, it remains one of the
most innovative hip-hop albums of all
time and a compelling justification for
Kanye’s insufferable ego.

An indulgent, flamboyant and de-
lightfully depraved LP, Fantasy largely
forgoes West’s signature soul samples
in favor of grandiose orchestration
and multi-part anthems. And while the
awards—show crasher is still prone to
boasts — “My presence is a present/Kiss’
my ass,” he declares at the beginning of
“Monster” —— West is, more often than
not, incredibly self-critical; both the

_ arena—sized “All of the Lights” and the

poignant “Runaway” ruminate fitfully
on the rapper’s somewhat transparent
personality flaws. I

As for the songs themselves, several
tracks — “Power,” “Monster,” “Lost in
the World” — scrape the edge of perfec-
tion. Others — like the opulent opener
“Dark Fantasy” and “Runaway” —— are
fresh enough to excuse their ugly mo-
ments (an inexplicable false ending in the
former; a three-minute vocoder solo in
the latter). Even‘the laziest of the songs,
“Devil in a New Dress,” has an irresist-
ible luster. V

In fact, the album’s dizzying array of
instrumentation, percussion, samples
and guest stars —— most excitingly, Nicki
Minaj, who massacres the ﬁnal verses of
“Monster” in a personality-shifting lyri-
cal rampage — ensure there’s something
for everyone to appreciate in its hour-
plus runtime. M

Fantasy is so expansive and dabbles
in so many genres that it seems more

appropriate to compare it to pop land-
marks —- The Beach Boys’ Pet Sounds,
MichaelJackson’s Thriller —— than hip-
hop ones. Nevertheless, fans and certain
publications — Slant, for instance —‘ are
giddily posing the big question: Is My
Beautiful Dark. Twisted Fantasy the best
hip—hop album ever?

Probably not. West isn’t a lyricist on
par with Nas — though as “Gorgeous”
and “Power” demonstrate, he’s no Soulja

~ Courtesy MCT Campus

Boy either — and My Beautiful Dark
Twisted Fantasy is not as deftly realized
as the ’90s masterpiece it’sb_eing pitted
against, Nas’s Illmatic. ‘

But West is easily one of the most cre-
ative artists to ever grace the game, and

if Fantasy fails to cement its position

as the best album in the genre’s history,
it might well claim a more substantial
title: the most influential. I

FASHION COLUMN

 

Schoolgirl if
garb has .

style merit

Bethie Girmai
Columnist

It’s that time of the year again. The temperature
is dropping, the leaves have fallen and Starbucks

has brought back its gingerbread latte. Winter is ”

almost in ﬁill swing and with the cold weather
approaching, I thought it was time to revisit my
fashion roots. -

As a child, Iwent to Catholic school, and it
made an indelible mark on my sense of fashion.
I was furious when my mom forced me to trans-
fer to a Catholic school in the third grade — I
didn’t care to leave my friends behind and wasn’t
looking forward to adjusting to an unfamiliar
environment. But most of all, Iwas dreading the
mandatory uniform policy. ,

The regulation garb consisted of a heinous na-

vy-plaid jumper; to be womwith apolyesterblend”

button-down shirt. To make matters worse, we
were only allowed to wear simple black shoes with
a heel that couldn’t extend past one inch. Even
more horrifyingwas the length of the jumper. It
hit mid-calf, which I always thoughtwas a shame
because it covered my best feature: my legs.
Despite my initial aversionto my transfer
from public to Catholic school, I grew to enjoy
it and took away a few life lessons. Do I follow
Sister Marie’s advice to leave room for the Holy
Spiritwhen I’m dancingwith a guy? No. Am I still

terriﬁed of nuns? Absolutely. Although many,‘

of the lessons Sister Marie tried to instill in me?
didn’t stick, ironically enough, the one thing I
took away from my time in Catholic school was
my sense of style.

After much consideration, I came to the con-
clusionthatprivate school garbworks fashionably
well in cold weather. When I looked through my ‘
closet, Ifound svveatervests, blazers, skirts, polos
and an endless array of oxford shirts, all reminis-
cent of my Catholic school days. More than just
super cute, these preppy styles have the kind of
practicality that winter clothes necessitate.-

’ Sweatervests and V-neck cardigans perfectly .
combine form and function. They are great for
winter because they’re wa_rm and easily dress
up an outﬁt. Blazers are perfect for the season
because they are versatile. A good blazer in a

ALBUM REVIEW

Sing in the season

Pink“ Martini releases a holiday albumin their eclectic style

Liz Keeney
Staff Writer

Joy to the World
Pink Martini
Heinz Records
B+

With the holiday seasonjus-t around the
corner, festive music is just the way to
get into a celebratory spirit.

With the release of their newest al-
bum,]oy to the World, 12—piece “little
orchestra” Pink ‘Martini hopes to capture
the essence of the holidays with;g.little
internationalflavor. . .

Pink Martini has been producing its
eclectic mix of international jazz and
orchestrated musical styles since 1997.
joy to the World is the band’s first foray
into holiday music. -

Classic Christmas tunes such as “San—
ta Baby,” “White Christmas” and “Little
Drummer Boy” are sure to satisfy anyone
looking to catch the Christmas spirit,
whereasvsongs like “Elohai, N’tzor.” and
“Ocho Kandelikas” add some diversity to
the selection of holiday music.

Lead vocalist China Forbes’ unique

 

voice gives each song a slightly jazzy feel,
and the band’s arrangement: matches
her vocal style well, giving the album’
a sound appropriate for family holiday
gatherings. But that sound does skew
toward a more mature audience, so it’s
not likely that Joy to the World will play
at any college parties. _

Still, overall, the album will be a treat
for fans of seasonal music of any age,
perfect for gettingover your food coma
or for getting some last minute holiday
shopping done. I

Prep look is

‘Skirts usually starttobe bypassed sometime
during the fall, once the temperature starts to
drop, but there’s no need to neglect them. As
long as the skirt is made of a heavier fabric, like
wool or corduroy, and pairedwith tights, they’re
perfectly appropriate for winter. '

Finally, polo and oxford shirts are a great in-
vestment for anyone because they can be easily
layered and paired with anything from dressy
slacks or matchstickcordsto ahigh—waisted skirt.
The bestpart of a Catholic schoolgirls wardrobe
is that all the, pieces can be worn as separates.

Although preppy dress is classic, practical
and fashionable, many shy away from the trend
because of the stereotypes attached to it. The
Catholic schoolgirl look is either synonymous
with being prudish or being overtly sexual.

But there is a happy medium between the
two extremes. You don’t have to channel Britney

 

classic chick

Spears circa “Baby One More Time” to rock the
look. And by no means do you have to dress as if
you’ve stepped out of a Ralph Lauren catalogue.

Although Catholic school garb is tradition-
ally conservative, it doesn’t have to be. The best
way to incorporate your preppy pieces with your
current wardrobe without going over the top is
to mix and match trends, like a button—down
with an oversized necklace. As for the overly
sexual schoolgirl look, you don’t have to tie your
button down above the midriff to add an edge to
the outﬁt. Simply pair a conservative article of
clothing with a sexy piece, like a lacy top paired
with a blazer.

Now I wear my preppy style with pride, know-
ing that, in many ways, it hearkens back to that
awful navy jumper. So if you wore a uniform, it
mightbe time to reconcile with your jumper—clad
past and rediscover the preppy look. I

Turnovers h

Football < 1

after a loss to Connecticut and Friday’s
loss to the Mountaineers, a champion-
ship seems almost unattainable.

“Obviously, it’s disappointing. We
just didn’t make enough plays,” Pitt head
coach Dave Wannstedt. “We didn’t make
enough plays on defense. We gave up
way too many plays on offense from a
turnover standpoint.” '

The Panthers committed four costly
turnovers against WVU, miscues that
allowed the Mountaineers to leave Pitts-
burgh with a blowout win despite being
outgained in total yardage 362-360.

“Ray Graham’s fumble, I thought,

happened when he was spinning. Dion
Lewis’ fumble, he was kind of climb-
ing over the top and laying on a body,”
Wannstedt said. “He thought he was
down, he wasn’t. Were they stripping
the ball more than anyone else? I’d
say‘ no. We didn’t protect the ball well
enough.” _

The turnovers, along with several un-
timely big plays allowed by the Pitt de-
fense, like Tavon Austin’s 71-yard touch-
down reception on WVU’s first drive of
the second half, did the Panthers in.

The defeat gave the Panthers their
ﬁfth loss of the season, a season where

expectations abounded as they were
ranked in the preseason top 20.

It also was the last home game

for Pitt’s 11 seniors who still haven’t
achieved the goal of winning the Big
East crown.
_ “I really can’t put the game into
words,” Alecxih said. “I feel the worst
for the seniors because I felt like I let
them down.” M

One of those seniors, captain Jabaal
Sheard, summed it up shortly after the
game. '

“We just fell short the last three
years,” he said. I

What you
might have 

missed over
break  

Kelly Flanigan
Staff Writer

.,‘

The men’s basketball team had an enjoyable
break, while two other Pitt sports teams — foot-
ball and women’s basketball—hadaforgettable
holiday. The following is a run—down of their

games.

Tuesday:
MEN’S BASKETBALL: N0. 5 Pitt Vs. Robert
Morris University, 74-53

The Zoolooked a little emptier than normal,
but the men’s basketball team put on a show as if
it were an ordinary night at the Petersen Events
Center, handily defeating the Colonials. Robert‘
Morris, which was playing without’ standout
guard Karon Abraham, was led by Russell_]ohn—
son who ﬁnished with a double—double, racking
up 15 points and 12 rebounds.

For the Panthers, Ashton Gibbs scored 20
points, Brad Wanamaker had 17, and both Gilbert
Brown and Gay McGhee contributed 11 points
each. Nasir Robinson pulled down 11 rebounds
for the Panthers, and McGhee carried out his
double-double of the game with 12 rebounds.

One problem for Pitt against the Colonials
was turnovers. Head coachjamie Dixon was

A not pleased with the number of turnovers, and

cites it as an area that needs improvement for
the Panthers.

“You’ve got to look at different things. We
held them to 30 percent, we outrebounded them
by 15, then we go to the negative of 15 turnovers
which is higher that we want it. We shoot for-..
12,” he said after the game. “For most teams,
theyaimfor15, we set our standards higher and
strive for 12. We’re always one of the lowest [for
turnovers] in the country.”

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL: No. 6 Duke vs. Pitt,

When the Blue Devils left the Petersen Events
Center on Wednesday night, they not only went
home with a rout _on the Panthers, they also
left with two Petersen Events Center game re-
cords. ‘*2

 Women’s basketball loses

Sports roundup < 9

Ryan Samson I Sta Photographer

Pitt guard Ashlee Anderson looks to make a pass earlier in the season against Youngstown State.

The basketball powerhouse Duke set the
record for most steals in a game at 16, and
also drained 37 ﬁeld goals, tying the all-time
record. '

Duke’s bench scored 44 points; whereas
Pitt’s scored two and the Panthers (2-2) were
unable to stop the Blue Devil (5-0) forwardsﬁas
they werecontinually outrebounded. Duke’s

scoringwas widespread, and six players ﬁnished .

with points in double ﬁgures. Pitt committed
25 turnovers. ‘ - -

“I don’t need to look at the film. I could tell ' .

you:- weak-side rebounding killed us, and our
turnovers,” Pitt head coach Agnus Berenato
said after the game. “They scored 32 pointsoff
of our turnovers, and look atthe score. You can’t
turn the ball over in the open court.”

Pitt senior Taneisha Harrison had a season-
high 16 points, and seniors Brittaney Thomas
and Shayla Scott contributed 12 and 10 points,
respectively.

Friday;
FOOTBALL: West Virginia vs. Pitt, 35-1o

Pitt (6-5, 4—2‘Big East) didn’t just lose to long-
time rival West Virginia (8-3, 4-2 Big East). They
losttheir chance to bring a BigEast Champion-
ship back to Pittsburgh and probably lost théir
chance for a BCS bowl berth.

Pitt quarterback Tino Sunseri threw an in-
terception on the ﬁrst drive that was returned
to Pitt’s 2-yard line. The Mountaineers scored.
But Pitt bounced back, on an 8-yard pass from
Sunseri to Devin Street to tie the game.

From there, it was all downhill for the Pan-
thers.

On the next Pitt possession, Dion Lewis
fumbled. Then Ray Graham fumbled. ‘When
it was all over the Panthers ﬁnished with four

total turnovers. .
Lack of execution on both offense and de-
fense plagued the Panthers.
“We had two or three opportunities to get

' points. You’re only going to get so many op-

portunities,” Pitt head coach Dave Wannstcdt

said. “I really thought we’d play better today.

We didn’ .” A ‘
Saturday

MEN-’S-BASIQEPBALL: No. 5 Pittvs. Penn,
82-58 '

The Panthers (7-0) showed their depth and
versatility as they defeated the Penn Quakers
at the Petersen ‘Events Center on Saturday
n#¥K- .

Jamie Dixon utilized 11 players in total and
they all reached double digits in scoring.

Ashton Gibbs had 12 points, and freshman
L]. Moore and Dante Taylor each contributed 11
points. Pitt’s bench even outscored the starters
by a margin of 10 points. . '

It seemed that the main problem for the
Quakers was their inability to match up physi-
cally with the Panthers or to stop Pitt’s fast bréak
offense. 1 ' I

“I deﬁnitely think it’s unique and that it’s
deﬁnitely special because of the fact that we
have guys who come off the bench who have
game experience,” senior forward Gil Brown
said. “With].]. Moore, Lamar Patterson and]._].
Richardson coming off the bench, it’s beneﬁ-
cial for us to have people who have experience
from past years and prior games this season. I
think they can only continue to grow and get
better.” '

The Pitt men’s basketball team returns to ac-
tion Wednesday night at Consol Energy Center
for the City Game against Duquesne. .
