Investigation into Western Psych
shooting to result in security changes

Aaron Stier—Cohen
Stay?” Wrz'ter'

District Attorney Stephen Zap-

pala said UPMC will be making -

security changes to manyof its
health care centers across Pitts-
burgh.

After the March shooting at
Western Psychiatric Institute and
Clinic that left two dead and seven
injured, the Allegheny County

7 District Attorney’s Ofﬁce and the

University of Pittsburgh Medi-
cal Center led two simultaneous
investigations into security at
WPIC and other medical center
buildings. The proposed changes

in policy come as a result of these

investigations.
“Our teams have been working
together,” Zappala said. “UPMC

put together a team to look into .

all their facilities.” , ”

Zappala said that the changes
will shorten emergency response
times. ’ '

“Get me in the building quick-
er, get my eyes in the building,”
Zappala said, describing two of

the aims ofUPMC’s new security
procedures.

Among the proposed changes
are swipe—card access to build-
ings for hospital staff, an armed
police presence in the building
and improved camera surveil-
lance. _ '

Currently, the entrance to
WPIC is supervised by a Pitt po-
lice ofﬁcer and private security
guard. Guests are required to sign
in before going farther into the
facility.

Harsh Trivedi, executive medi-
cal director and chief of staff for
Vanderbilt Psychiatric Hospital,
said security at hospitals can be
a tricky issue, especially when
dealing with psychiatric facilities.

“It’s an ever-evolving land-
scape,” Trivedi said. “We try and
balance safety and civil liberties.”

People who go to Vanderbilt

Psychiatric Hospital for serious
treatment are held in a separate
waiting room with higher ‘security
than other patients and visitors.

Like Pitt, Vanderbilt Univer-
sity contains several hospitals
and clinics on its campus. It’s also

located just outside of a major
city, Nashville, Tenn.

Vanderbilt University also has
its own police force, in addition
to some volunteers and private
security personnel. According to
Trivedi, however, campus police
are the only staff that would re-
spond to a serious security inci-

dent like the one that occurred at .

WPIC last spring.

Whether or not the Pitt po-
lice has the staff to provide all of
UPMC’s Oakland buildings with
the armed presence Zappala
hopes for is unclear.

Pitt Police Chief Tim Delaney

declined to comment on how .

proposed changes would affect
his force.

UPMC spokeswoman Gloria
Krepslalso declined to comment,
except to say that the plans are
still in the evaluation process.

UPMC’s investigative team
presented their ﬁndings to the
UPMC Board of Directors on
Sept. 14. '

“They took this very seri-
ously,” Zappala said. “I’m very
pleased.” I

Speaker shares with students the art of ‘Getting Bi’

Gwenn Barney
/Isszszfant News Editor

More than 30 students gathered
in the second—floor ballroom of
the O’Hara Student Center last
night to receive their “vaccina-
tions.”

The vaccines, administered
by professional speaker and edu-
cator Robyn Ochs via her speech
“Bisexuality 101 and Beyond,”

 

weren’t for any sort of biological

malady, nor were they a preven-i

tive measure.

“I call this my bi-phobia
vaccine,” Ochs said before pre-
senting to the audience the six
reasons she believes bisexuality
carries a stigma in America.

The event was sponsored’

by the Rainbow Alliance, Pitt’s
student LGBTQ advocacy group.
Ochs, bisexual herself, is author

of the book “Getting Bi:'Voices
of Bisexuals Around the World.”
She speaks across the country
advocating for the bisexual com-
munity.

Ochs expressed to the audi-
ence that understanding the
“why” behind common negative
stereotypes of bisexuals can help
them combat stereotypes. '

“By' understanding which of
the six categories underlies each

stereotype [of bisexuals], I can
address the assumption under-
neath the statement instead of
taking the statement as a slap in
the face,” she said.

Over the course of her hour-
long speech ﬁlled with audi-
ence participation and humor,
Ochs explored each of the six
categories, pairing them with
a complementary hand motion.

For the first category, Ochs

had the audience position their
index fingers and thumbs from
both hands into a triangle to
resemble an iceberg. She said
the first reason bisexuality is
misperceived is because it’s dif-
ficult to determine whether a
person is bisexual by only look-
ing at them.

“[Bisexuals] don’t get recog- H

BISEXUALITY

nized as bisexuals unless they’re
in a threesome,” Ochs said.

Ochs described a second rea_—
son for stigmatization of the
bisexual population as “eroto-
phobia,” a pervasive uneasiness
with anything to do with overt
sexuality.

“In the United States, we have
this perverse relationship to the
erotic,” she said. “Sex is used to
sell everything, but on the other
hand, we’re in a culture that is
so sex-negative.”

Ochs said this negative take
on sex in America especially
harms the LGBTQ community
because of the close association
many Americans make between
members of that community and
the ways in which they express
their sexualities.

Sexism was the third aspect
of American culture that Ochs
viewed as working against the
LGBTQ community.

“If.we lived in a culture where
people really were treated equal-
ly, then we wouldn’t really care
so much who was doing what
with whom,” she said.

She explained that many

Americans have expectations of
what gender roles should look

like and that bisexuals break _

from these expectations.

“I think bisexual people are
really scary, because we’re un-
contained,” she said.

In her fourth reason, Ochs
interpreted the disgruntled
feelings some members of the
gay community hold toward
bisexuals.

Citing a study by sociologist
Paula Rodriguez Rust, Ochs told
the audience that lesbians can
express negative sentiments to-
ward bisexuals as a result of a
sort of territorial struggle. She
drew a spectrum on the board
with the word “straight” on
one end, “lesbian” on the other
and “bisexual” in the middle to
show visually what little space
stands between a person being
considered bisexual as opposed
to lesbian.

She illustrated this point
with a personal anecdote about
a lesbian friend who jokingly
said ofebisexuals, “You’re;steal-
ing our lesbians. You people are
coming in and diluting our les-
bians and stealing our people.”

Ochs presented the human
tendency to split everything
into two categories as the ﬁfth

reason behind bisexual stigma-
tization.

“We have trouble with com-
plexity,” Ochs said. “We try to

put everything into a binary,‘

even when it’s not.”
She admitted that even after
years of studying this element of

_ the human mind, she still makes

the mistake of trying to place

of reasons behind the stigmati-
zation of bisexuals, one added
only this past spring when a
student suggested it ‘at one of
her speeches.

She described this final
problem as a lack of informa-
tion about the LGBTQ commu-
nity in general and bisexuals in
particular. 2 k

“We have irouyble with,
complexity. We try to put’
everything into a binary, even
when it’sinot.”

Robyn Ochs  

people into the binary categories
of gay or straight. ,

“You can’t avoid doing that,”
she said. “But you can be aware
that you’re doing it and correct
it.” ‘ V '

Finally, Ochs relayed the
most recent addition to her list

“It malceshme feel a little bit
more fo‘r.giving,” Ochs said of
those influenced by this ﬁnal
categoryﬁ-‘Because people aren’t
responsible for whatthey’re not
taught.”_' -e ‘ _ .

After finishing the explana-—-

‘tion of all six categories, Ochs

left her audience with an affir-
mation. '

“Now, you’re all vaccinated,”
she said.

The author’s appearance last_
night marked her first time on
campus since speaking at Pitt
three years ago.

“We thought we’d bring her in
for a new generation of people,”
Rainbow Alliance President Tri-

. cia Dougherty said. /.

Dougherty’s organization
decided‘ to bring Ochs in after
Rainbow Alliance Business Man-
ager Brandon Benjamin heard
her speak at the Creating .Change
Conference, a national confer-
ence on LGBTQ equality, and
raved about her speaking ability.

“She was my favorite event
at the Creating Ghange Confer-
ence,” Benjamin said. “Robyn
has this infectious enthusiasm.
She allows you to kind of dis-
cover what she’s trying to teach.”

Benjamin also expressed the
importance of Ochs’ role as a
voice forthe bisexual commu-
nity.- V. , =  . .

“We bring plenty. of gay
speakers and. lesbian speakers
in,” he said. “But we don’tspeak
toall the letters in theLGBT.

That’s something we’re working
. hard to change.” I C

Tour groups — both prospective
students and the general public
alike — whisper with excitement
as they peer around the doors.
Friends from other schools are
p jealous. . V

I groan with utter disgust

when I realize I’m going to.be
subjected to these rooms for
anothe-r-semester.-, ‘V  M, T .

The Cathedral of Learning,
as the token building that Pitt
students frequently Instagram,
boasts 29 impressive nationality
rooms, 27 -of which function as
classrooms. Displaying archi-
tecture and design from various
countries, each of the rooms is
unique: some are ornately‘dec-
orated,_while others feel more
like a typical classroom.

Cool, right? I hate them.

I don’t hate them for what
they are. As someone who loves
learning about other cultures,
theycertainly are fascinating. I
just hate when one of my classes
is assigned to meet in these tor-
ture chambers.

These rooms are too distract-
ing. With the fancy decor, how
am I supposedto focus on what

 

 

too busy trying to decipher the
proverbs written on the wall?
Those stained glass windows
are beautiful. That portrait is
interesting, I wonder who that
guy is? Are those real African

..tribal pieces?

Wait a minute. Realist theory
differs from liberal institution-
alism  how, again? How many
slides of this PowerPoint have
I missed? . ..

Most of the time, you’re lucky
to even see a PowerPoint if your
classxtakes place in a national-
ity room. Professors often have
_to request the services of Pitt’s
Center for Instructional De-
velopment and Distance Edu-
cation in order to receive the

*techi_iology needed to conduct

a class. Someone has to physi-
callyftome to the classroom to
set up “a screen and a projector
in order for students to benefit
fromjbasic technology, as these
rooms are ill-equipped. Then,
someone must return at the end
of the session to dismantlethe
jury-rigged setup.

Conﬁrmed by CIDDE’s web-
site, none of the nationality
rooms that function as class-
rooms have any media capa-

classrooms are pretty,

0 pretty impractical

' bilities.

No sound system or audio, no
video or projectors. You won’t
even find a PC connection.

These rooms are unbeliev-
ably uncomfortable. As many
are not climate controlled, stu-
dents spend the first month
or so sweating uncontrollably
while trying to pay attention.
There is no reprieve from our
non—air conditioned apartments
or the Quad residence halls.» The
temperature is just too high.

Furthermore, the seats them-
selves are about as pleasant as
walking across asphalt in your
bare feet during the month of
August. The chairs have'abso-
lutely no give to them. They are
rigid, made entirely of wood.

Students sit up perfectly
straight for the duration of class:
slouching or sitting even mod-
erately comfortably for those of
us with long legs is physically
impossible. Would it kill you to
at least put some form of a cush-
ion on the chair?

So it would seem, consider-
ing that only two of the rooms
feature an amenity this simple.
Thank you, French and Israel

My biggest peeve here might
only apply to 10 percent of the
population, but I am part of
that percentage. These class-
rooms are absolutely not, by
any means, left—handed friendly.
As if we don’t suffer enough in
a world made for right domi-
nance, there are virtually no left-
handed desks in the nationality
rooms.

Every other classroom has a
few lefty desks. They’re always
pushed to the side, but they are

my notebook is in my lap, cush-
ioned by my knees. This is not
functional.

On my self—guided tour of
the nationality rooms, I made
a point ofcounting the seats.

That number amounts to
barely 2 percent of the avail-
able seats. If the population of

4 left—handed individuals is indeed
10 percent of the total, we are
certainly at a disadvantage here.

I know they’re unique. I know

' they’re somewhat of a tourist at:

will never undermine the fact

With new-found confidence following iast week’s shking upset of rgini ch, redshirt junior wide receiver Devin Street (15) and the rest of the Panthers hope to

Following upset victory, Pitt eyes win against Gardner—Webb

be smiiing again after Saturday’s game at Heinz Field against the Gardner-Webb’ Runnin’ Bulldogs. Sheldon Satenstein [Senior Staff Photographer

Stay?‘ Wrz'ter

Inastunning upset ofvirginia Tech last week,
the Pitt football team showed that the Panthers
have the ability to play theirbest football when
facing nationally—ranked opposition.

M But as many fans might recall from the
home opener against Football Championship
Subdivision school Youngstown State, Pitt
has also shown an ability to underestimate
lesser foes.

With another FCS team in Gardner—Webb
(0-3) coming to Heinz Field this Saturday, it
remains to be seen if the Panthers (1-2, 0-1
Big East) are more like the team that crushed
Virginia Tech or the one that wilted against
Youngstown State and Cincinnati. _

Heading into Saturday’s matchup with the

Runnin’ Bulldogs, the Panthers know they I

need to record another win.

“I think [Virginia Tech] was a good win,
but we still have a lot of work to do,” Pitt junior
wide receiver Devin Street said. “It gave us
some momentum for Gardner—Webb. A game
only comes once a week, so you can’t miss
opportunities.”

Against an 0-3 FCS team that fell to Wof—
ford, Richmond and Samford by a combined
81 points, Pitt enters the game as the huge

favorite. But the Panthers, who own a 10-1
all-time record against FCS schools, know that
they cannot look past the Runnin’ Bulldogs.
Gardner—Webb defeated Akron 38-37 two
years ago and came close to knocking offGeor—

the much-criticized quarterback needs to show
that he can consistently produce quality per-

After last Saturday’s game, Coach Chryst
acknowledged this fact, stating that things are

Coming off its bad as they seem.”

Chryst era, Pitt is sized the team’s fo-

riding a new wave
of momentum.
The victory
against the No. 13
team in the nation
culminated in 537
total yards of of-
fense for Pitt, the
most the team has
seen in 12 years.
Running back Ray
Graham scored ~
three touchdowns, and quarterback Tino Sun-
seri threw for 283 yards and three touchdowns.
Star freshman running back Rushel Shell also

- ran for 157 yards.

The Pitt defense, which looked horrendous
in the season’s ﬁrst two games, even forced
four turnovers against Virginia Tech.

cus, concentration
on improvement
and continued
growth.

“I think you’ve
got to build on ev-
erything you do
positively. It wasn’t
all of the sudden
a whole different
group,” Chryst said.
“The focus is on you
and your team and how you can get better.
Everyweek, you go about it in the same way,
and over time, [the players] understand that
you have to be consisten .”

Gardner—Webb head coach Ron Dickerson
Jr. sees the Panthers as extremely formidable
opponents.

“They’ve gotten back to the Pitt team that
everybody expected coming into the year,”

. he said. “They have one of the best running

back duos in the country, the quarterback is
good, and they have Biletnikoff Award guys
at receiver. They are big on both lines. We’re
going to be facing some elite talent.”

Dickerson has extensive ties to football
coaching in the Pittsburgh region.

His father, Ron Dickerson Sr., currently
coaches wide receivers at Gardner—Webb and
was the ﬁrst black man to coach an NCAA Di-
vision I football team at Temple. Before that,
he was an assistant coach at Pitt underjackie
Sherrill in 1978.

And many Pitt fans may remember tight 

end Dorin Dickerson, Ron Sr.’s nephew.
Gardner—Webb is led by quarterback Lu-
cas Beatty, who completed 30-for-48 passes
and threw for 320 yards against Samford last
week. Runnin’ Bulldog redshirt freshman wide

receiver Carlton Heard caught seven passes ‘

for 107 yards in the loss.

The Panthers still have ground to make up
from early losses this season, and Chryst said
his team will be ready to face Gardner—Webb
on Saturday at Heinz Field when the game
kicks off at 3:30 p.m. ,

“If you’re a player and you respect your
team and appreciate your team, there is ab—
solutely no way you don’t respect your op-
ponent,” he said. a

BIG EAST BREAKDOWN

Conference teams record trio
of wins over ACC schools

_ Rutgers and Louisville remain the teams to heat in the Big East.

Dustin Gabler
Senior Staﬁ Writer

With only one previous nonconference
win, the Big East football members en-
tered the third week of the season to an
extremely high amount of criticism.

But they had opportunities to change
that last weekend —— three, to be exact.

In those three games, the Big East came
out unscathed —- a perfect 3-0 against 9
Atlantic Coast Conference competition.
Many argue that these results hurt the
ACC’s national reputation, but the Big East
executives surely celebrated a good week-
end for the conference’s football schools.

No. 19 Louisville raced ahead of North
Carolina early and held the Tar Heels off
late for the 39-34 win. Connecticut got
redemption from Temple and picked up
a 24-21 win over Maryland. And in the -
biggest upset of the week, Pitt hosted No.
13 Virginia Tech and handed them ,a 35-17
whipping, making the Panthers the talk
of the weekend.

The Big East has three more chances
to prove itself this weekend, and the big-
gest opportunity will come with Rutgers
at struggling, though talented, Arkansas.
An SEC win would look good for one of
the Big East’s premier teams.

With conference outlook slowly be-

     

MCT Campus

coming clearer, here are my weekly rank-

ings of the Big East’s eight football teams:_

1. Rutgers

The Scarlet Knights (3-0, 1-0 Big East)
took down South Florida, 23-13, in the
only Big East matchup of the week.

Once again, the Rutgers defense looked
phenomenal, forcing USF quarterback
B.]. Daniels into three interceptions.
Offensively, Rutgers struggled with ball
movement andpenalties but didn’t turn
the ball over, and that proved key. Behind
running back Jawan ]amison’s 151-yard
performance, the Scarlet Knights scored
enough to hold back the Bulls.

2. Louisville

Continuing to make a case for Big East
Player of the Year, quarterback Teddy
Bridgewater was 23—of—28 for 279 yards
and three touchdowns as No. 19 Louisville
defeated North Carolina. .

The sophomore continues to light up
the Big East and has garnered some Heis-
man talk this week.

On defense, the Cardinals (3-0) looked
uneasy after holding a 36-7 lead at half-

time, as North Carolina came back to
make it a five—point game. If Louisville
could have put together a full game, the
Cardinals would be in the top spot.

3. Cincinnati

Taking on Delaware State doesn’t say
much about the Bearcats, but only win-
ning by 16 points against such inferior
opposition does.

The offense looked worse than it did in
the opener against Pitt and raised some
questions as Cincinnati turned the ball

over six times. However, the Bearcats’
(2-0, 1-0 Big East) rushing attack still
looked potent, tallying 259 yards.

Cincinnati now has the week off and
time to prepare for what will be an angry
Virginia Tech team.

4. South Florida

Daniels’ three interceptions hurt the
Bulls (2-1, 0-1 Big East) but didn’t kill
them.

South Florida still had a chance to
drive for a game—winning touchdown late.
in the fourth quarter against Rutgers,
but the offense couldn’t muster even one
first down and turned the ball over to the

Scarlet Knights.

The Bulls’ defense showed its worth in
the defeat. But offensively, USF’s passing
game is inconsistent, and its rushing at-
tack doesn’t exist.

5. Connecticut

Maryland may be worse than a lot of
non—BCS programs, but the Huskies (2-1)
got a huge perception lift, taking down
the Terrapins, 24-21.

Both teams struggled to move the
ball on offense, as UConn led the yard-
age battle with only 223 yards gained.
But Connecticut’s defense looked stout.

This week, the Huskies take on Mid-

American Conference school Western
Michigan, who played tight games against
Illinois and Minnesota and could upset
Connecticut.

6. Pittsburgh

Four takeaways for the Pitt defense
paved the way for the Panthers (1-2, 0-1
Big East) to cruise through Virginia Tech,
3517-

The Pitt rushing attack proved dan-
gerous, as freshman stud Rushel Shell
and senior Ray Graham combined for 251
yards. And forcing four turnovers, the
defense appeared to be a much—improved
unit, especially on the line, which pres-
sured Virginia Tech quarterback Logan
Thomas all day. 5

More performances like Saturday’s win
for the offensive and defensive linemen of
Pitt, and the Panthers could get back into
the Big East championship race. ‘

7; Temple

The Owls (1-1) took the week off and
dropped in my standings because their
previous loss to Maryland looks worse
with Connecticut’s win over the Terrapins.

But Templelcan get some momentum
back by taking down Penn State on the
road this weekend.

While the Nittany Lions are down fol-
lowing the sanctions that the school’s
football program received from the NCAA,
many still perceive Penn State as a top-
notch Big Ten school. The Owls have been
close to beating their in—state rival both
of the last two years.

8. Syracuse

A week after gaining praise as the best .

o-2-team in the nation because of their
13-point loss to then-No. 2 Southern Cali-
fornia, the Orange looked disinterested
against FCS school Stony Brook last week.

Syracuse wound up beating Stony
Brook, 28-17, but didn’t take the lead until

- well into the third quarter. The game was
up for grabs until late in the fourth.

However, quarterback Ryan Nassib
continued to light up the passing game
— throwing for 335 yards and three
touchdowns — and he will hope to lead
the Orange to a victory at Minnesota this
Saturday night. @
