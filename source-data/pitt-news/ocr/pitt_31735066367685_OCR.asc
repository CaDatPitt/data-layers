’ Men’s Council

Tabulates 600

Questionnaires

Early Count Shows
Strong Interest In
Big Brother Plan _

Recent tabulations fo Men’s
Council questionnaires have
revealed that only one-third
of the .1800 distributed forms
have been ﬁlled out and re-

 turned.

Preliminary examination of the
600 questionnaires that have been
returned indicate a favorable re-
sponse by the majority of students
toward the proposed big brother
system for incoming freshmen.

The beanies issue showed a divi-
sion of opinion among the student
body. The proposal states that
freshmen should wear beanies for
the period during which they are
adjusting to University life.

Tours of the campus for
freshmen has also met with ap-
proval on those completed ques-
tionnaires. The ﬁnal report on
the Men’s Council questionnaire
should be available after Easter
vacation. ,

At this point Dr. William Crafts,
dean of men, has officially en-
dorsed the big brother system.
Men’s Council is presently in the
process of assembling a list of up-
perclassmen qualiﬁed for the du-
ties of a big brother. _

Charles Lebowitz, vice president
of Men’s Council, had the follow-
ing to say in support of the pro-
posed plan. “The big brother sys-
tem has been tried with success
at other universities, and -Men’s
Council feels that it can become
a signiﬁcant part of P.itt’s fresh-
men orientation program.”

Men students still wishing to ﬁll
out questionnaires should do so
immediately and return the forms
to the boxes provided in Holland
Hall, the Student Union, and the
ground ﬂoor of the Catlfedral.

300 Registered

Spring‘ Trimester

Nearly 300 men and women will
live on campus during the coming
This‘ number
will nearly double last year’s total,
according to Donald Van Houten,
Director of Men’s Housing.

Approximately 135 undergrad-
uate women will live in McCor-
mick ‘Hall, the only dormitory that
will be available to women. This
is better than a 100 per cent in-
crease over last year’s 65 women
residents.

Present residents of McCormick
must be out of their ,rooms by 6
p.m., April 22.

The ﬁfth, sixth and seventh
ﬂoors of Schenley Hall will be
open to men residents. Approx-
imately 145 men are expected,
surpassing last year’s total of 78.

Dormitory rates for the spring
trimester will be the same as in
the past since the proposed in-
crease‘ in rates will not go into
effect until fall.

‘Early Admits’ Receive
Scholastic Recognition

Approximately nine freshmen and seven sophomores

who entered the University as Early Admission Students in
1959 and 1960 will be among those honored at the Convoca-

tion on April 5.

One of the early entrants from each class, having at-
tained an overall QPA of 4.0, will receive special recognition

Honors Program
Recognizes 530

A, At Syria Mosque

Approximately 530 students will
be honored at the annual Honors
Convocation in Syria Mosque on
April 5, Wed., All 10 a.m. and 11
am. classes will be dismissed so
that students and faculty may at-
tend the ceremony at 10:30 a.m.

Each of thestudents being hon-
ored has had a 3.25 QPA for all
of his terms in school. The num-
ber of students to be honored has
dropped from -last year’s total of
‘750.

Thirty-six students who have
maintained a 4.0 QPA for the
past t 0 terms will be named
University scholars. Last year,
34 University scholars were
named.

Chief Justice Earl Warren will
address the audience at the.cere-
monies. Atfer his address an hon-
orary degree will be conferred on
him. ‘

The program will also include
a formal faculty proce/ssional
and recessional. The proces_sion

will leave the Commons Room”?

at 10:15 a.m.

Chancellor Edward H. Litch-
ﬁeld will preside over the Convo-
cation. ‘

The purpose of Honors Convo-
cation is to give special recogni-
tion to those students whose
scholarship, on a cumulative basis,
meets the standards of their re-
spective schools for graduating
with honors. Both graduate and
undergraduate students are in-

Gas University Scholars.

The University has found this
Early Admission rogram success-
ful enough to co tinue it next fall
in spite, of the increased number
of applications from high school
graduates. They plan to accept ap-

proximately the same‘ number of

students as in the past.

Four out of the 13 students
enrolledunder this program in
1959 further accelerated their
college careers by attending the
third trimester. Only two of the
students transferred to other

' schools after their second term.

‘-‘While the remaining 14 stu-
dents will not be honored at this
convocation, most of them" have
maintained above satisfactory
work at the University,” stated
Mauritz.Lindvall, associate direc-
tor of the Coordinated Education
Center.

The University _Counselling
Center, on the basis of interviews
with all of the students, reports
that “they made a quick and easy
adjustment to college life and
many have joined various social
groups and are taking part in ex-
tra-curricular activities.”

In order to be admitted to this
program a student must have
completed his junior year in high
school and must be nominated by
his high school principal. The
ﬁnal decision is made after re-
view by the University Admis-
sions office.

Law,Schoolto Hold

Open House Session

Event To Give Undergraduates
Information About Curriculum

The Graduate School of

Law will conduct an Open

House on"; Friday, April 7 for pre—laW students in order to
familiarize them with the school, its members and the oppor-

tunities available to lawyers.

Since the University lacks an undergraduate pre-law
curriculum,’ Dr. Thomas M. Cooley explained that “many

students go through the under-9

graduate schools at Pitt without
ever having had ﬁrst hand infor-
mation as to what the study of
law is like, what lawyers do, or
what the, opportunities are in the
professions of law.”

At the present time, there are
fewer students registered in ‘Law
Schools in the United States than
there were in 1930.

“The purpose of this'i,0pen
House is to provide this type of
information to undergraduates
by arranging a meeting between
those interested, and the faculty
and students of the law school,”
Cooley added. _

This ‘meeting, a coffee hour, will
be held at 3 p.m. -on the 14th
floor, Cl. Following a brief ad-
dress by Dr. Cooley on “Why
Study Law,” the undergraduates
will be given the opportunity to
ask questions and meet various
members of the faculty.

In addition, students are in-
vited to attend a class on torts (a
civil, wrong committed between
individuals, giving one the right
to sue) at 9:50 a.m. in 1409 C1.

and a class on contracts, in the.

same room, at 2 p.m. . ~
Since there is no undergraduate
honorary society for pre-law stu-
dents at the University, some fac-
ulty members feel that the John
Marshall club could be reactivated
in order to establish a bond be-

tween all undergraduate pre—law'

students and the Law school.

Debate Union ContinuesTelecast

Series, Presents
Variety of Famous

, People on WQED

By TOM BRYANT

In the fall of 1954, the William
Pitt ’Debating Union began a

‘ weekly telecast on WQED which

has since stretched over 250 pro-
grams and seven academic years.
Originally entitled “Campus,” the
series dealt with speciﬁc problems
of co-education, R.O.T.C., and
scholarship. .

The following year an inter-
view—discussion format was adopt-
ed with prominent guests being
questioned by a panel of three
students and a newspaper reporter
and the program title changedito
“Face The People.”

Each Wednesday evening “Face
The People” presents locally and
nationally famous personalities to
Pittsburgh viewers. Local critics
have written that “some of the
most intellectually challenging
discussion on Pittsburgh airwaves
always turns up on the Pitt De-
bating Union’s ‘Face the People’
on WQED.”

Panel of" Three '

The panel consists of three stu-
dents representing W.P.D.U. in-
cluding Joseph Hallal, student
producer of the program, and a
reporter from a downtown news-
paper. This month, Frank Chris-
topher represents the Pittsburgh
Press. " '

“Our biggest problem is per-
suading guests to appear on the
program, says Dr.‘ Mary M.
Roberts, associate director of the
debating union.

“Many well-known personali-

A ties are reluctant to face the‘

cameras. Our television manager
Joe Hallal often_ makes a series
of eight or ten phone calls before
a subject agrees to appear on the
show.”

Although moderator Woody
Turner and producer Hallal have
a “free hand” in presenting the

4, .

“FACE THE PEOPLE” appears /as a. simple question-answer dis-
cussion, but behind the scenes there is an endless array of techni-
cians, directors, student meetings, phone calls, and occasionally

“late—arriving” guests.

o

series, Dr. Roberts is actually re-
sponsible for program policies.
“Joe and Woody operate freely in
a framework of educational ob-
jectives that Dr. Newman and
myself erect. Should they step out
of bounds, our decision would be
ﬁnal.” Dr. Robert P. Newman is
the director of W.P.D.U., currently
on- a one-year leave-of—absence
from the group.

Subjects are contacted several
weeks in advance to organize a
schedule of appearances and send
publicity to magazines and news-
papers. Dr. Roberts says no guest
has failed to appear at the WQED
studios for the broadcast.

Some months ago, a plane
carrying a prized interviewee
"arrived late at the airport. A
police escort complete with
sirens and motorcycles deliv-
ered the cargo to the Fifth Ave-
nue station at 7:59 p.m., one
minute before airtime._ Had the
guest failed to appear, Roberts
says “we would just have a

Before airtime, the panelists
confer with the subject to discuss
background, interests, and write
questions. Questions are also sup-
plied by viewers who are urged
to phone MUseum 3-1300 with
their inquiries. .

Dr. Roberts says one of the
most interesting programs includ-
ed an appearance by a research
psychologist who demonstrated
the use of electric shock treat-
ments in stimulating motivation
of mice.

.. “There were no phone calls

board was jammed. People were
so fascinated that they forgot.
to telephone their questions un-
til the moderator said ‘good-

Thamembers of the union agree
that Dr. Hugh Cleland of the
University -History Department
brought the most fascinating eve-
ning, when Elder Statesman Nor-
_mLan Thomas faced the people to
discuss politics. “To all our guests,
to the dozens of reporters who
have served as panelists, and to
the staff of4_WQED we, owe an im-
mense debt of gratitude for our
seven year run.

If their contributions in the
years to come, match those of the
past, ‘Face The People’ will lose
none of its stature.”

First Jacks  

Tourney

Brings Crown to Co-ed

By TED COLTON

“Victory is sweet!” That’s what pretty Judi Wallace was
uttering a week ago when she pulled a surprise come—frorh
behind upset over John Yaccino in one of the most thrilling
athletic contests ever witnessed at Pitt. ,

It was the ﬁrst annual Pitt Jacks tournament. Yaccino,
a Panther football player, had been heralded as “the best

Jacks player inschool” until Judi‘

came along. I ~
She quickly challenged ‘‘Yacc’’

2' to a contest and thus initiated the

r‘

-J’

-a

ﬁrst Pitt Jacks tournament.
‘ Home Jacks
Yaccino had the advantage of
the home jacks which were sup-
plied by his manager “Chill” Will.
All Judi had to go on were a head
full of cute red hair and a quick
pair of hands. ~
Yaccino jumped off to an
early lead. He quickly went
through “babies” ' and onto
“cherries in the basket.” There
he missed on foursies. Now it
was Judi’s turn and the crowd
knew that John was in trouble.
After proceeding through
“babies” and “cherries in the
basket” with ease, Judi missed on
sixies or “half moonsies.” But
John was not to be denied.
Missed Again
He ﬁnished “cherries in the
basket” and went all the way to
ninesies on ‘‘half moonsies.” Judi
again missed on sixsies and Yac-
cino built up a solid lead going all
the way to sevensies in “slapsies.”
Judi ﬁnally got sixies and
went to foursies of “slaDSi€S-”
The tension was mounting as
the spectators cheered on their
favorite athlete.

was still having trouble with
“slapsies.”

She ﬁn-ally worked ‘her way up
to sevensies in “slapsies” where
she missed. But John put the

pressure on, moving up to ninesies’
of5*“bouncies.” It appeared that
John would retain his crown.
Now it was Judi’s turn. She
I got by sevensies, eightsies, nine-
sies and tensies, of “slapsies.”'
“Yacc” still had a conﬁdent
smile on his face, but just then,
Judi executed the greatest
maneuver of the game.

At the start of each set, each
player throws the jacks up in the
air; catches them on the back of
the hand; then throws them up
again, and catches them in the
palm of the hand. If all ten jacks
are caught both times you auto-
matically win that set.

Final Set

On the ﬁnal set Judi caught all
the jacks both times to become
the new Jacks champion of the
University of Pittsburgh.

John accepted the loss hard.
After all victory was only nine-
sies and tensies away.

“I didn’t think that it was pos-
sible to beat him,” Judi comment-
ed, wiping the perspiration from
her brow. “He is definitely one of
the ﬁnest jacks players in the
country.”

Yaccino, who learned to play
jacks during the halftimes of the
football games, said, “I still can’t
believe it! There _I was on
ninesies or ‘bouncies’ and she
was way back on sevensies of
‘slapsies’ and she comes on to
beat me. It just goes to show you
that the game is never won until
the last jack" is picked up.”
