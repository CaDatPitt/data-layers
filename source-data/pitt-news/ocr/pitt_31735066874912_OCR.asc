Security Precautions

Harm Civil Defense

By Iiw BOTHMAN
Civil Defense authorities are not well enough informed
to "establish a strong nation-wide program, Col. Wm. D.‘ Eister,
professor of military sciences and tactics, told the Pitt News

in aspecial interview Monday
Overt security measures prev

, Col. Eister also consented to serve on a special Civil De-
fense. committee at Pitt, if University authorities should ﬁnd

it important to form one. Be

cause he is leaving in June,

Col. John A. Murray, PAST, did not comment on the com-

mittee. '

Murrayvstated that he has pre- 4
gsented to proper authorities
views on the particular prob-
lem. But he‘ assured_ that the
Air Force department would
be “willing to cooperate in
every way” with plans and any
program that might be estab-
lished at the university.

«Both officers were contacted
concerning a recent statement
made by Civil Defense director
Louis W. Johnston, that “All
plans for the precautionary evacu-
ation of the University, principally
to the lower levels of the Cathe-
dral, have been scrapped due to
a change in defense policy in
county headquarters downtown.”

Modify Laws

Eister, the top military author-
ity here, asserted that “the law
has to be modiﬁed to the extent
necessary to allow the Atomic En-
ergy Commission to pass out
more information to Civil De-
fense, authorities on a national

Biddle Announces

James McHale, assistant pro-do
fessor of speech and a Pitt gradu-

Dean of Men, Theodore Bid-

" said of McHale: “I’m very
pleased that the speech depart-
ment has seen fit to release him
from some of his teaching duties
so that he can take over the di-
rectorship of this very important
student activity.

Plans for next year’s produc-
tions have not yet crystallized in
the new director’s mind. He said
that he must first talk with the
Players, but hinted that he would

The new director of Pitt Play-

University. While a student here,
he acted in the‘Player produc-

He was wary about the pros-
pects of~setting up a strong CD
program at the present time. The
military administrator s t a t e d,
“the University can’t develop a
really workable plan until such
time as they can ﬁt into a city
plan which will involve CIT, Du-
quesne, and other colleges.”

Top to Bottom

It is unlikely, however, that de-
fense planning on a city, country,
or state basis can be ﬁrmly en-
trenched without concrete na-
tional support. It is important
that planning be handled from
“the top down instead of the bot-
tom up,” he reiterated. ‘Even the
establishm-ent of a CD committee
at Pitt would have to be initiated
by the top administration, he
assured.

The University of Pittsburgh
Omnibus, the ﬁrst non-technical
student magazine to be published

sale at 8 a.m., Friday, May 27.
The cover will feature a full color
shot of the Cathedral of Learning.

The magazine’s ﬁction will

where.” Two short stories, sub-
mitted by University English
students-——“Food of the Gods,”

Tune,” by Don Miller, will be
included. -
There will be a special Pub-
lication Board meeting later this
, semester to determine how many
issues can be published next

can be done by students at the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh,” Editor Jim
DeWeese said.

Owners Answer Deiscougjf Poll  

Early Impressions

Include Complaints  

By JIM MARINO P

Local merchants participating in the Student Discount

Service were interviewed Monday for their early» reactions to

the program which is being sponsored by the joint student
governments of Pittsburgh colleges. , 

Restraint, complaint, and enthusiasm were noted in the

ﬁrst impressions of the cut-rate service.

prietors interviewed admitted

All of the pro-

that it was too. soon to make _

a positive statement about the re-
sults of the plan.

Most of them, however, wished
to express some opinion on the
returns that they had (or didn’t
have) from the sefvice.

Thesame questions were asked
in all the interviews which re-
corded the enthusiasm of the store
owners, the participation by stu-
dents and suggestions for improve-
ment of the service. Shopkeepers
were asked if they noticed any re-
sults from the program, if they
would renew their contract, if they
liked the progress of the plan so
far, what schools had actively

' taken part, and what, if any,'im-

Today’s issue of the Pitt
Newsis the last that will be
published during the present
semester. Publication will be
resumed during fall registra-
tion.

R-I-L Changes
1956 Format

P Religion-in-Life executive com-
mittee has drawn up a new struc-
ture for next year’s program. The
newlplan will simplify planning
to bring together twelve small
committees that have previously

operated separately of each other.

In_ the new format, the worship
committee will be the central body
of action and will be divided into
budget, speakers, special projects,
and public relations groups.

The committee will consist of
four faith representatives-—i-Cathm

lic, Jewish, Orthodox, and Protes-’

tant—-who will lead the other four
divisions under which smaller
committees will operate. The
representatives will work with
their own faith advisors in plan-
ning the programs.

provements_ they would make in
the plan.

More Results Expected

Ten out of the eleven stores
polled said that stud‘ents had used
their cards in making purchases,
although most were hesitant to re-
port an increase in sales or the
appearance of new customers.
Most of these shops believed that

’more results will be evident when
‘promotion of the plan is renewed

in the ~ fall semester.

Potential buying power of the
member colleges is far from be-
ing realized by the present trend
of student purchases, but all of
the merchants were willing to
sign up for another year with
the hope that participation would
increase in time. * n

One conclusion drawn from the .

early- progress reports was that
those ‘stores dealing primarily in
women’s apparel showed the over-
all increase in discount buying.

Criticisms Offered

Several improvements and criti-
cisms were offered by those inter-
viewed. It was suggested that
more advertisement and promotion
be given to the, plan in the col-
leges. Laxity on the part of the
students was attributed in part to
“misinformation and poor sales-
manship by the schools” and “in-
suflicient information about the
location of stores.”

One store owner expressed the
desire that all students who hold
the discount cards be made to car-
ry identiﬁcation pictures. These
photos are now used only by Pitt’
students. It was suggested that the
cards themselves, bear the photo
and _signature of the .holder for
positive identiﬁcation. .

A similar discount service was
tried at CornellUniversity and
failed because of “forgeries and
lack of proper credentials.” A

Another survey is planned for
the fall semester when more con-
clusive results will be possible.

Pitt Engineering Center

May Cause Law Suit

Pittsburgh is the topic of a law suit as the nation’s chemili-"
cal engineers voted to make Pittsburgh the engineering capi-
tal of the nation. The law suit‘ arises over the fact that the
Engineer’s present headquarters was donated with theibe-

the School.

lief that the capital would remain in New York.

Announcement of national ap-
proval of Pittsburgh was made by
c. G. Kirkbride of~Philadelphia,
past president of the American
Institute of Chemical Engineers.
However, New York is so eager to

‘keep its engineers, that it has

threatened the group with a law
suit if they leave ’

Societies now have joint head-
quarters in New York, but are
moving due to lack of space.

.. Pittsburgh was first recom-
mended last February as the
center by presidents of ﬁve so-
cieties. However, it is not the only
city interested in the engineers.
Philadelphia and New York have
shown their interest. ’

Philadelphia tripled its offer of
ﬁnancial aid, in an effort to per-
suade governing boards of the so-
cieties from accepting the recom-
mendations of their presidents for
the Pittsburgh move. »

The Mellon family came to
Pittsburgh’s aid with an offer of
$500,000. This sum, added to the
$1,500,000, already pledged‘ by
Pitts-burgh supporters, puts this
city a half a million dollars ahead
of the Philadelphia movement.

Governing board of the Ameri-
can Institute of Electrical En-

gineers voted last month in favor
of Pittsburgh,” causing chemical
engineers to do likewise.

Junior-sized A path y

.

By Irv Rothman

Combine in a working body an ex-Pitt News
editor, ODK Man of the Year, and the shrewdest
political organizer this university has witnessed
since this columnist has been here, and you have
some idea of the caliber leadership which pushed
through the new student magazine in little more
than two weeks——a remarkable deed, in itself. Jim
DeWeese, Bob Dickinson, and
Dave Guyol have pulled all their
proven resources to put on the
newsstands by Friday morning
a literary magazine Worthy of
the University.

Sneak previews of short stor-
ies compiled from English classes
by ﬁction editor Don Miller are
enough to say this magazine is
worthwhile. Miller, who has also
entered a story in the publication, wrote the back-

‘ ground information on all nationality rooms which

appeared inthe current OWL. -
Trial Issue

When DeWeese, almost three weeks ago, asked
the University publications board to‘ approve a
trial issue of a student magazine to replace the

“Panther,” the question was “Could students pro-

duce a high caliber literary magazine with humor?”
The edition "speaks for itself. And the answer

is “Yes”. .

Maybe a Chancellor »

We suspect that word about a new chancellor ,

will be released by mid-summer. We'7’can’t be
sure. It seems that no one is sure about any-
thing when it comes to ﬁnding out even who
are candidates for the position. The secret has
been so jealously guarded that even high adminis-
trators‘ are guessing who their next boss will be.

e Questions

 

They know as little as students—-about this issue.

The News, earlier in the year, inquired into
Civil Defense procedures at the University. From
recent comments by Col. Wm. D. Eister prospect‘
for a concrete program in the near future appeal‘
dim. As for Civil Defense coordinator Louis John-

stonfprospectsl are dim that he will have something ~

to offer.

Storeowners Comment
The Discount Service has stirred some comment

from local storeowners, if not fromstudents. But,

it appears to be a sound program,Aif only other
area colleges would cooperate with uniform ad~
ministration. If it increases business for stores
presently subscribed, more may enter, but time
will tell. — -

Coronation has caused some discussion——but the
only question which seemssensible to ask is “How

soon will women decide that it’s about time in ‘
question the validity of the program?” It’s as aged .

as the old “guild system” and should suffer “ the
same fortune. Despite simple explanations and

childish reasons offered for its continuance, women
hold to tradition and -the fascination of being..

crowned. V .

which hasbeen used-in the past. Its an expensive.
satisfaction. . ' L A
The Student Union issue for next semester will
be assignment of deﬁnite facilities to be installed
in ﬁnal blue prints. We look’ for a swimming pool
which won’t be installed anywhere in the far future,
if not there, now. Possibly polls might be passed
through classrooms for ten or ﬁfteen minutes for
students . to list the. type of facilities they‘ want.

Then the faculty-student committee can discuss «

intelligently ‘a student union for students.

very formallyin the Commons Room. -But this year lack of

cooperation on behalf of the student body has forced the

dance to deviate». from the original -tradition.

There "is achance that the dance will have to be can-

that perhaps ‘efforts should have been combined with those
of'_the,Carniva1_Ball committee tomake one huge formal
social event in_ the Commons -Room to close the school
season. Seniors ‘could well be the honored guests ‘after the V

week—long Carnival;

recuperate their ﬁnancial status before their closing social

function.

Thi.s*prese'nt apathy bringsto light another problem. ’
The goal of the Dean of Men’s oﬂice for the past year has
been to better integrate cooperation between classes. Thus,
each class was to sponsor a social event within the year.
The freshmen" and seniors have already made their com-
mittment, the sophomores are'hoping.to shine forth with one '
‘next year, and the juniors are stuck holding -the tickets

and'“arrangements for Friday.

The class social movement will have taken _a step back-
ward if juniors don’t push their dance, and seniors don’t
attend. It’s disappointing. One of the obvious questions in
order is “What happened to the junior class officers?”

enrolled would be getting star
material for its basketball team.
And Hennon chose Pitt‘.

Perhaps the chief reason for
this choice is Gene Aromatorio,

"By Joan Thomas
It seems to me that the Uni-
versity, in its aim for a liberal
education to prepare students for

"‘ society, is forgetting to_ foster
” along the female contingent’s
most vital after-graduatiﬁon vir-

tue. Curricu-
lum has been ,
geared to the
biological, fi-
nancial, a n d
e m o t i o n a l C
p h a s e s o I
m a t r i mony,
but a working
knowledge of
h 0 me eco-

nomics h a s
b e e n disre-
garded.

Such a course would, through
necessity, be a non-credit course
with a regular tuition fee,,IQug_
to an old gentlemen’s agreement
with Carnegie Tech, the Uni-
versity may not establish an
accredited h-ome econom.ics
course. But -this would be more
an extra-curricular activity with
a fee, meeting, perhaps, one or
two evenings a week. Women
could certainly proﬁt from the

ll‘

 

experience of the full time sec- ,

retary and home economist now
employed by the twelfth ﬂoor,
also making full use of her
qualiﬁcations.

A course covering the prized

art of domestics could include

twists of etiquette suitable for
anything-from a Friday after-
noon Canasta game to a Sunday
evening formal dinner. The be-
hind—the—sceries assembling of
the hors d’oeuvres, punch, demi-
tasse, and even snacks would be
uncurtained for those who have
seen them only in their served
forms. »

A catalogue of unusual recipes
and notes on the intricacies of
hostessing would be a boon to
any young housewife. Table
decorations could be plotted out
by the students themselves, with
only minimum supervision fol-
lowing the original presentation
of ideas and possibilities.

' The facilities arethere. In fact,
plans for use of the costly
twelfth ﬂoor kitchen," could be
much ’ more functional, with
more and varied student partici-
pation. Future. graduates, would

learn the many uses )0! the
freezers, waterless cookers, elec-
tric ranges,’ dishwashers, and
pressure cookery.. _
Each class member could tak ,
her turn planning, preparing,
and hostessing for a dinner.
Proper sequence -of silverware
setting, complex and touchy
protocol in seating arrange-

ments, and correct procedures’

for announcing a formal dinner
could "be practiced.

Poise and sureness‘ would
evolve from the practice afford-
ed by such a scheme. Efficiency
in food planning and purchasing
would be learned, and methods
of preservation practiced.

A home economics course
might be the incentive needed to
draw more ~-activity to the
twelfth ﬂoor. It would give
women the occasion to work
closely together, and might draw
particularly from the ranks of
the pinned and engaged .w1io
persist in leaving after classes.

It’s a thought, and maybe next
year the present underclassmeno
could start working on it. Who
knows, they might really get
something cooking. , . _

French Instructor World Traveler

Miss Henry Retires ‘After 37 Years

By ROSEMARY RAY

A member of Pitt’s faculty who
has crossed the Atlantic Ocean 14
times, will cross it again as part
of her retirement plans. She is
Blossom Henry, associate profes-
sor of French at the University of
Pittsburgh for 37% years.

Miss Henry, who has traveled
extensively through Europe, South
America, and the Far East, plans
to visit friends and relatives in
France and Argentina after her

. retirement this semester. She also

hopes to do some reading and
writing and review several lan-
guages she once learned but has
forgotten-

“The time has come,” she said,
“to do somethings I have always
wanted to do but never had the
time for.” _

‘It’s not surprising that Miss
Henry’s plans include reading, for
many of her ideas revolve around
the fact that people, and especially
teachers, should read more.

“Most teachers and students do_

not read as much good literature
as they used to,” she said. “It
seems that nowadays radio and
television take too much of their
time.”

Miss Henry hopes that Pitt will
someday have a library building

to provide a better place for read-
ing and to house a large collection
of books for the students. She
added that the University has
come a long way in library fa-
cilities since she came 371/2 years
ago, but the retiring teacher still
feels the need for a separate build-
ing devoted to books.

When asked what other im-
provements she would like to see
at Pitt she answered:

“Naturally we need a student
union, not only as a place for stu-
dents to get together but also for
students and faculty to meet. We
should have a student union to
furnish the close student-faculty
relationship missing in the school.
I would also like to see smaller

classes and more “better pi-‘epared
teachers to provide the right kind
of teaching. _

“Of course, the University offi-
cials know the needs of Pitt and
their future plans include im-
provements towards these goals.”

In conclusion, Miss Henry com-
mented on the role, of today’s
college students in helping to
secure world peace.

“They must learn to under-
stand _ and be more tolerant
towards different cultures/’_ she
said. “They must become more in-
terested in people different from
us. To do this, today’s college stu-
dents must read, think, listen, and
study more carefully.”

SCIENCE MADE SIMPLE;_ _

In this day and age, as I like to call it, everybody should know
something about science. ,Unfortunately, however, the great majority

— of us are majoring in elocution, and we do notget 9. chance to take

any science. But we can at least learn the fundamentals.
Though this column is intended to be a source of innocent merri-
ment for all sexes and not to concern itself with weighty matters,

- I have asked the makers of Philip Morris whether I might not from

time to time use this space for a short lesson in science. “Makers,”
I said to them, “might I not from time to time use this space for a
short lesson in science?”

“Bless you, lad!” cried the makers, chuckling. “You may cer-
tainly use this space from time to time for 9.‘ short lesson in science.”

They are very benign men, the makers, fond of children, small
animals, community singing, and simple country food. Their benevo-
lence is due in no small measure to the cigarettes they smoke, for
Philip Morris is a cigarette to soothe the most sava e of breasts. I
refer not only to the quality of the tobacco-whicli, as everyone
knows, is amiable, humane, and gracious—but also to the quality
of the package. Here is no ﬁendishly contrived container to fray the
ﬁngernails and rasp the nerves. Here, instead, is the most simple
of devices: you pull a tab, a snap is heard, and there, ready at hand,
areyour Philip Morris Cigarettes. Strike a match, take a. puff, and
heave a delicious little rippling sigh of pure content.

So, with the cordial concurrence of the makers, I will from time to
time ‘devote this column to a brief lesson in science.

Let us start today with chemistry. It is ﬁtting that chemistry
should be the ﬁrst of our series, for chemistry is the oldest of sciences,
having been discovered by Ben Franklin in 123 B.C. when an apple
fell on his head while he was shooting the breeze with Pytha oras
one day outside the Acropolis. (The reason they were outsidg the

. Acro olis and not inside was that Pythagoras had been thrown out

for rawing right triangles all over the walls. They had several

_meetings outside the Acropolis, but ﬁnally Franklin said, “Look,

Pythagoras, this is nothing against you, see, but I'm no kid any more
and if I keep laying around on this wet rass with you, I'm liable
to get the break-bone fever. I'm going insi e.” Pytha oras, friendless
off to Brussels
where he married a girl named Harriet Sigafoos and went into; the
linseed oil game. He would also certainly be forgotten today had
not Shakespeare written “0thello.”) ‘A
‘But I digress. We were beginning a discussion of chemistry, and
the best way to begin is," of course, with fundamentals. Chemicals
are divided into elements. There are four: air, earth, ﬁre, and water.
Any number of delightful combinations can be made from these

A ’_ elements, such as ﬁrewater, dacron, and chef’s salad.

Chemicals can be further divided into the classes of explosive
and non-explosive. A wise chemist always touches a match. to his
chemicals before he begins an experiment.

A great variety of containers of different sizes and shapes are used
in a chemistry lab. There are tubes, vials, beakers, ﬂasks, pipettes,
and retorts. (A retort is also 3. snappy comeback, such as “Oh, yeah?”
or -“So’s your old man!” ‘_

(Perhaps the most famous retort ever made was delivered by none
other than Noah Webster himself. It seems that one day Mr. Web-
ster's wife walked unexpectedly into Mr. Webster’: office and found‘
%r. Webster’: secretary sitting on Mr. Webster’: knee. “Why ‘Mr.

ebster!” cried Mr. Webster’: wife. “I am sur risedl”

(“No, my dear,” he replied. “I am surprised. ou are astonished."

(Well, sir, it must be admitted that old Mr. Webster ot oil’ 1

ood one, but still one can not help wishing he had spent ess time-

riﬂin with his secretary, and more time working on his diction-
Ir)’-
Take, for instance, what happened to me not long ago. I went to the
dictionary to look up “houghband” which is 9. band that you pass
around the leg and neck of an animal. At the time I was lanning
to pass bands around the le : and necks of some anima s, and I
wanted to be sure I ordered t e ri ht thing. _— _

(Well sir, thumbing through t e H’: in the dictionary, I lisp-
ened to come across “horse.” And this is how Mr. Webster deﬁnes
horse"—“a large, solid hoofed herbivorous mammal, used as a
draft animal.”

(Now this, I submit, is 'ust plain sloppinesl. The most cursory
investigation would have : own Mr. Webster that horses are not
mammals. Mammals give milk. Horse: do not give milk. It has to be
taken from them under, the most severe duress. _

(Nor is-the horse a draft animal, as Mr. Webster as. s. Man is in
draft animal. Mr. Webster obviously had the cavalry in mind, but
even in the cavalry it is men who are drafted. Horse: volunteer.)

6

But I digress. We were discussing chemistry. I have told you the
most important aspects, but there are many more——far too many
to cover in the space remaining here. However, I am sure that there
is a fine chemistry lab at your vet own college. Wh don't you go up
some afternoon and poke around Make a kind of un day out of it.
Bring ukeleles. Wear funny hats. Toast frankfurter: on the Bunsen
burners. Be guy, be merry, be loose, for chemistry is your friend!

Panther St—a_r—Runsi88O
With Ram’s Courtney

Panther hopes in the 79th annual IC4A championships
at Tri-Borough’ Stadium in New York City will hinge on
middle distance runner Arnie Sowell and javelin thrower
Pat Scordo, Friday and Saturday. , ‘

These two are the only Blue and Gold entries that are

definite in the track and ﬁeld¢

carnival with the ﬁeld expected
to comprise more than 500 ath-
letes ‘from 47 different colleges
and universities.

The center of attraction will
undoubtly be Sowell, Coach Carl
Olson’s best runner since Johnny
Woodruff was burning up the cin-
ders in the late thirties.

_ Bump Cost Win .

The lightning-fast Sowell will
be out to break the relay jinx
that so far has haunted him in
both the Penn and Coliseum Re-
lays. In the Coliseum Relays, So-
well was fouled on the last turn
just when it appeared he was all
set to put on his ﬁnishing burst

as the winner.

‘ This caused Sowell to break
stride and not ﬁnish in a ﬁeld
which consisted of such running
stars as Mal Whitﬁeld, Lon Spur-
rier, and Ronnie Delaney of Villa-
nova who was judged the winner
in 1:50.5. Tom’lCourtney of Ford-
ham, who ﬁnished ﬁrst, was dis-
qualiﬁed for this fouling incident.
’ Thus, when Sowell meets Court-
ney in the IC4A’s, he will be out
after more than just 88( honors,
he’ll be out to prove he is the best
half—miler\ running. today which
sports critics have -judged him to
be. ’
Injuries‘ Drop Relay,

In the ﬁeld events, the Jungle
Cats will be represented by Scor-
do who was a letterman the last
two years. The Kane senior is

‘ probably the most under—rated of

the Olsonmen, and has earned his
right to compete in New York by
the ﬁne throwing he has dis-
played in the last couple meets.
' Injuries have caused Olson to
dispense with any idea he. might
have had about entering his mile
relay team. Ever since sprinter
Bill Green was spiked in the
Penn Relays, the locals have had
to be content with a makeshift
quartet t‘(t doesn’t figure to be
able to cope with the caliber of
opposition that they would meet
in the IC4A’s.

Although Gunderson and Berry

Rifle Team Fires
In NRA Tourney

To Close Season

Team captain Tom Shepard,
along with four other seniors, will
compete for the last time as
Panther riﬂemen next Monday
when the team closes the season
by ﬁring in the National Riﬂe
Association’s outdoor meet at
Rosedale riﬂe range. The leading
competition should come from
Akron University which already
holds one decision over the Blue
and Gold in regular season play.

With Shepard ﬁring a season
average of 282 and James Cleary,
Dave Jacobson, and’Tom Klaric
scoring steadily in the 270’s, the
sharpshooters gained the Greater
Pittsburgh Riﬂe League title in a
clutch victory over Duquesne in
a shoot-off.

American riﬂe team topped oﬁ

ALL-CAMPUS TRACK

The starting time for the
all-campus track meet, which
will combine both interfrater-
nity and intramural thinclads,
has been_ changed from 5:00 to
5:30 this afternoon. Medals
will be awarded to the first
and second. place ﬁnishers in
each event while the team ’
scores determine the IF cham-
pionship.

a successful year for Shepard who
has been an outstanding marks-
man in college shooting circles for
three years. Although there are a
number of graduating seniors on
the team, there will remain with
the Panther corps an excellent
nucleus for next year’s team.

Klaric, who posted a 271 aver-
age this season, and Jacobson with
277, will be back to lead the re-
turning varsity marksmen next‘
year. Dick Konis and James Flynn
will also be back.

Spouse, Date Tickets
Ready for Grid Season

A long-awaited for plan whereby Pitt students will be
able to purchase football tickets at a reduced rate for spouse
or date has become a reality and will go into effect next fall.

The plan, which enables

married students to purchase

a season ticket for wife or hus-
band at the reduced price of $10,
also gives single students a chance
to get a $3.50 reserved student
section ticket for $2.

Since the football season gets
underway before the semester this
fall, several steps will be taken
beforehand in order to give the

students the full beneﬁts of this

plan.
Permits at Gate

1. In order that students may
get into the California game of
September 17 whentthey still will
not have their activities,cards,
the registration permits contained
in the registration kit will be
negotiable at the gate.

2. Because the California
game comes before‘ classes, mar-
ried students will' be unable to
purchase the reduced rate season
ticket before this game. What the
wedded student must do for this

served seat ticket at the $3.50
price and then retain the stub.

After registration the student
must present proof to the Dean of
Men’s oifice that he or she has a
spouse. Then a reserved seat ticket
for the remainder of the home
schedule will be sold to the mar-
ried student for $6.50 at the Field
House. This brings the total cash
outlay to $10 which is on a par
with the deal given to faculty
members.

200 Raffle Tickets

As far as the date tickets are

concerned, 2-00 of these will be
raffled off for each of the last four
games. The winners of the raffle
will be sold reserved seat tickets
for $2 instead of the usual $3.50.

The rafﬁe will be conducted by
some student organization yet to
be determined by the Dean of
Men’s ofﬁce and the Athletic De-

game is purchase a regular re- partment.

“You Can't
Eat Grass"

BY GENE AROMATORIO
Sports Editor

 

perform for the fans but not for,

_avoid these bad investments

 

Students many times ask the question, “How do colleges go about
getting high school athletes?” We all know they offer scholarships,
of course, and we’ve often heard of other inducements set before the
young ball players, but what I had in mindwhen I dropped in on
Bob Timmons was the process Panther officials go through in trying
to interest a high schooler in Pitt.

Since the basketball season ended only recently and is being
given increasing emphasis at Pitt, I concerned myself with the hoop
sport.

Usually the way the coaches get on a player’s trail is by seeing
him ﬁrsthand or hearing about him from a reliable source. Then
they start waching him. They in our case means Timmons, Frosh
Coach Carl Peterson, or assistant Dutch Burch.

If the Panther mentor decides he likes a particular player, the
ﬁrst move is to check on the boy’s

grades. In the past, Pitt has had
it’s share of athletes who could

the professors. So, determined to
in
the future, it has become strict
Pitt policy to make sure an ath-
lete can manage the sheepskin as
well as the cowhide. ,

9 If the potential Panther passes the grade check, the next move
is an invitation to the Field House. Should the youthful cager like
the idea of making Pitt his alma mater, he is then given a scholar-
ship offer. Most boys take timeto think it over and see what other
schools might step forward. Timmons states_ he never tries to over-
sell an athlete. “We want those boys who want to come here,” he
emphasizes. ' »

Of course, this isn’t ‘the ﬁrst and ﬁnal move the Panther
coaching family makes while waiting for the hoopster to make
up his mind. To keep up relations, a prospect is usually invited
down to some special athletic event such as a track meet or
baseball game. This gives the Panther tutors an opportunity ' to

»show "the boy around the Cathedral, Chapel, etc. »

Also, a tour of the Field House, Stadium, and a meeting with
the dean of the school in which the ball player may enroll help
to give the player at little of the Pitt atmosphere.

‘ In the event an athlete envisions a medical career, a tour through
the medical school is in order. This was the case a week ago when
Wampum High’s Don Hennon visited the med school with former

 

‘Panther athlete Dick Dietrick acting as guide. The next day Hen-

non announced his decision to enroll here.

What happens after a ball player has made up his mind
to enroll at Pitt? Well, he’s not forgotten about until the fall
semesternrolls around. Relations are kept up during the sum-
mer. Maybe one of the coaches drops into the boy’s home-
town, a letter now and then, or maybe a phone call.

If these sound like unnecessary doings after a boy has already
announced his plans, then maybe the fact that about one-half of
them have a change of heart and-, consequently a change of plans
during the summer months, might not make it seem so foolish
after all. .

As to the schools that give Pitt the most competition for an
athlete’s services, Timmons quick, laughing reply was, “Campus
schools.” Timmons doesn’t waste words when a youth comes up
with the argument that Pitt doesn’t have too big of a campus com-
pared to other schools. His quip-back is usually, “You can’t. eat that
grass after ‘you graduate.” ’ '

Though Timmons’ words may be terse, they are signiﬁ-
cant in that an athlete only plays varsity ball for three years but
has the rest of his lifetime to practice what he’s learned. So,
it makes sense that heshouldpick a school for its academic value
and not its landscape.

Netmen Tangle With. Duquesne

, National honors may not be bestowed upon the Panther
tennis squad this season but if the netters take today’s match
with Duquesne at Mellon Park they will win the collegiate
tennis championship of the city.

Carnegie Tech,’ last year’s city°
champs, fell before the Pittites
5-4, last Saturday when two close
double-s matches went to the Pan-
thers. Herb Thompson and Art
Derbasse edged Don Rowley and
Dick Rughimer of Tech 3-6, 8-6,
8-6. Jerry Davis and Neal Zweig
also took a tight doubles match
6-4, 3-6, 7-5.

Geneva was the Panthers’ vic-

tim the day before the Tech en-
counter as the Pittites rolled
over the Covies, 7-2. One of the
two matches dropped to Geneva
cam-e when Coach Jim Tully de-

cided to play Davis and Zweig,
normally the number three dou-
bles team, against the number
two Geneva doubles combination.

With wins over Duquesne an-d

By AL PELAEZ
Panther mittmen will receive a chance to partially atone

for a losing season this afternoon at Moore Field in Brook-
line when ‘they get another crack at the strong Duquesne

intra-city rivals resulted in a
151A-21/2 triumph for the McCor-
mickmen, they will be heavily fav-
ored today.

The locals are rolling along
in high gear with last Firady’s
9-0 slaughter of Carnegie Tech
being their seventh victory in
ten starts. Every member of the
sextet notched a win and sopho-
more Ken Fisher gained medal-
ist honors with a 72.

Participating, along with Fisher,
in the clean sweep over the Tar-
tans were team captain Bill Stock-
dale, Dick Ryabik, Jim Zoccola,
Gene Farrell, and Dick Siegal. The
shutout bears out what Coach
Dave McCormick said at the be-
ginning of the campaign—that the
squad would improve greatly as
the season progressed. '

After dropping their ﬁrst two
meets to Navy and West Virginia,
the duffers have rallied to emerge
victorious in seven of their last
eight tilts. They will have to be at
peak form for the season-ending
road trip this week-end, though,
when they will meet two of the
toughest teams on their schedule-
Bucknel Friday and Penn State
Saturday. .

With ﬁve returning lettermen
included among their six start-
ers, Bucknell is vastly improved
over last year when they posted
a 5-9 chart while Penn State
showed its power by ﬁnishing
fourth in the Eastern Collegiate

they’re anxious to get another
crack at the Pottstown Dandy.

Coach Bobby Lewis will send
Don Miller to the mound in an
attempt to put the second loss
on the Dukes’ season chart. Miller
will be gunning for his third win
as against four losses.

The baseball fortunes of the

Lewismen, 6-3, behind the six-9

  
   

Dukes’ edged the

Blue and Gold nine took a sharp

turn upward last weekend as they
‘snapped out of their six-game
losing streak with victories over
West Virginia and Bucknell.

Friday’s game with the Moun-
ties marked the high point of the
season for the locals. The loss
was only the fourth as against 19
wins for the NCAA bound Moun-
tainers. Miller chalked up the
win over the Mounties, holding
them to eight hits.

The Panthers scored once in the
second and twice in the third on
Bill Schmidt’s two-run triple.

Mountie ace Jim Heise took the
loss, ‘his second in twelve deci-
sions. Heise held the Panthers to
ﬁve hits and struck out ten but
Schmidt’s clutch hit proved his
undoing. .

In Saturday’s game the Lew-
ismen outlasted Bucknell for a
7-5 victory. Ronnie Moog was
coasting along with a shutout
until the ﬁnalethree innings when
the Bisons scored their ﬁve runs.
Moog’s win gave the sophomore
hurler three victories for the sea-
son—high for any Panther
moundsman.

With only two games remain-
ing, Schmidt continues to pace
the Panther batters with an aver-9
age of .346. Ken Krapf is second
with a mark of .333 followed by
last year’s leader, Milt Emery

For Greek Week‘.

And Homecoming

The shifting of the Float Parade
to Homecoming Day was officially
approved. At a meeting between
Dean Biddle, Jack I-Iardman,
assistant to the dean, Bob Sedler,
Student Congress president, Mr.
Robert Arthur, band director,
Shirley Backstrom, ﬂoat parade
chairman, , and Don King, I.F.
president, no objections were
voiced. '

If the Miami band would come
to Pittsburgh for their game, the.
ﬂoat parade would have to preceed
the game and the band would
have preference at half time. The
ﬂoatparade would also coincide
with Greek Week as well as
homecoming. ‘

Sedler voiced his sorrow that
only a few members take an in-
terest in Student government. He
stated that next year, if a member
is absent two times without ‘a
valid excuse or if ‘many meetings
are_ missed, the S.C. member will
be dismissed. .

Student Congress also planned
three pep rallies for the coming

year, for the‘ Nebraska, Miami,“
and West Virginia games. - ei _
