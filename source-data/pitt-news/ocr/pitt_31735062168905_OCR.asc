by EARLE JACOBS

The University’s new hillside dor-

mitories will be completed in March,
1972. at the earliest. The Pitt News
learned last Friday from Edison Mont-
gomery, Vice-Chancellor of Finance.

Last spring, Montgomery indicated
that the University’s first preference
for housing was the hillside above the
engineering buildings. -

The University asked the Pennsyl-
vania General State Authority (GSA)
for funds at that time, but the GSA
did not approve the plans until Sep-
tember 18. On September 21, Deeter,
Ritchey, Sipple, a Pittsburgh archi-
tectural firm, was informed that they

could make detailed plans for the new-

housing. . . .

University dormitories currently
house approximately. 3,100 students.
The University rents space in the
Webster Hall Hotel and in the Mt.
Mercy College dormitories for several
hundred more. The University issued
a- list of projected dormitory enroll-
ment for the next ten years last spring,
and planned to have 3,700 students in
the dorms by 1970 and 4,700 by 1971.

Since the new hillside dormitories
will not be ready until 1972 at the ear-
liest, Montgomery indicated that the
University will probably have to ac-
cept more commuters or rent more

statement of Assistant Professor
of Economics Da1:itl'Houston calls
for an experiment requesting the
(lisarnzing of campus police. Hous-
ton read his statement at a recent
Faculty Senate meeting.)

“As contemporary discourse
shows, the conception and func-
tion of the University in society
is continually being broadened
and extended. No longer is the
university merely the place for
the creation and dissemination of

. the hoary and arcane knowledge

of professors. Students, faculty,
and even administrators are de-
manding that the university be
relevant to their lives and times.
And one of the most remarkable
discoveries of our times is the ex-
tent to which we have “escaped
from freedom,” the extent to
which impersonal bureaucracies
reach into our lives and mold and
shape _them. The ‘reform, revolu-
tion, and change, ;which iwesee

dom, and many would insist that
the only proper role for the uni-
versity is in the vanguard of this
struggle. The freedom, limited
though it is, inherent in the uni-
versity makes it a logical place
for experimentation in freedom
and power redistribution.

These experiments are difficult,
often painful and the outcomes
are often in doubt, but if.we are
to succeed we must begin from
as open and free an environment
as possible. In our relatively small
and gentle campus.there are 30
to 40 security officers who aid and
help us in numerous ways: med-
ically with information, letting us
into buildings, and protecting our
lives and property. In order to do
the last they carry loaded revol-
vers and cans of Mace, which pre-
pare them for the potential, but

Solar System Psychedelics
Sadden Steel City Pseudos

by N OSNEVEL

The groovy people of Pittsburgh
went hip for a night —— or at least
they thought they did.

Friday evening, Solar System
Lite and Power Company staged
its first “visual orgasm” at the
William Penn Hotel ballroom.
The light show turned out to be a
tremendous costume ball rivaled
only by Halloween. All of Pitts-
burgh’s “hip” population seemed
to be there, attired in varous
freak garb. In addition to those 15
people were about 3,000 pseudo-
freaks who set aside their Kings
clothing, Gant shirts, T—shirts, and

' Bass Weejuns to display their Ne-

hru fashions and flowered shirts
so as to fit in with the Steel City’s
“beautiful” people.

So many people turned up (or

turned on) for the light show, that
literally hundreds were turned
away from the doors. As others
left the show, these persons were
eventually admitted. The ball-
room was wall-to-wall people.
Dancing became a safety hazard
as the dancers tried to avoid trip-
ping over each other or over pop
bottles that were spread across
the floor. As nearly as I could as-
certain, not too many were trip-
ping-

The lights themselves left some-
thing to bedesired. This was due
to the physical make-up of the
room. It is a large oblong-shaped

ballroom used for things like balls J

(I would assume) and weddings
(being as my parents were mar-
ried in that room 29 years ago). A
light show should be shown in a
more enclosed symmetrically de-

I . Page 4—THE.  NEWS-—Wednesday, October 9, 1968

, C: A In recent weeks, there has been a great deal of discus-
' I ,-sion concerning the use of chemical mace. More recently this
general discussion has permeated into the staid atmosphere on

' i campus, for the campus police now wear mace containers on
their belts.

There is a great body of literature pointing to the advan- V
tages and disadvantages of the use of mace. Advocates of
mace say that it is far better for an individual to be tempor-
arily incapacitated by liquid mace than for a person to be per-
manently incapacitated by a bullet. In this sense the use of
chemical mace is, indeed, humane.

- Many medical experts, however, maintain the use of chem-

. ical mace may, in fact, be quite harmful to the individual. The
office of U.S. Surgeon General reported “mace may be more
harmful than was originally believed.” San Francisco Opth-
amologist Dr. Lawrence Rose says the main ingredient in
chemical mace, methyl chloroform, is a “central nervous svs—

- term depressant.”Rose reports that mace can cause the collapse
of blood vessels in the lungs which limits the normal breath-
ing process.

In response to these reports, a number of U. S. cities have
discontinued the use of mace. This list includes Los Angeles
———a city reputed to have the most sophisticated police force in
the nation. In San Francisco the Health Department has not
approved the use of chemical mace.

It is unfortunate that no authoritative body of literature
exists that completely eliminates the uncertanties involved with
the use of chemical mace. In this situation of inconclusive evi-
dence it is impossible for The Pitt. News to condemn or condone
the use of chemical mace.

We can, nevertheless, comment on the fact that our cam-

  
 

 

 

.F...._Reﬂections Of The Spleen

New Wave of Apathy Submerges
Campus in Complete Absurdity

by MARC SIMON

In the last few months this University has been
beset by a number of new student groups, all of them
trying to bring about changes in the policies of our
school.

It seems that more and more students are “get—
ting involved,” and it also appears that the apathy
which once reigned supreme on this campus is grad-
ually dying out.

However, upon investigation of the situation
I found that there is a new student. organization
which has arisen in direct protest to this wave of in-
volvement. They call themselves the United Stu-
dents for Apathy, or U.S.A. In an interview with
their leader, I.M. Bland, I found out what the group
stood for and how it was progressing.

“IN THE FIRST place," said Bland blandly.
“we feel that the student’s right to be indifferent is
being violated by these involvement groups. Before
these revolutionary groups came about. one could

always say he really didn’t care what the adminis-
tration did—now, he has to either defend it or oppose
it.”

“This put an awful strain on the student who

isn't used to thinking about things—why should he have

to worry about updating the curriculum, changing
social rules, and the like, when he could be watch-
ing television, playing gin, or just sleeping ?” he
asked. « .

I ASKED HIM how his organization was funct-
ioning. “It’s been going great,” Bland said. “We

recently held a rally on the Cathedral lawn and
no one showed up. proving how really apathetic our
members are. My chief assistant, A.S. Yuwere. in-
forms me that we’ve received only one phone call
since our organization has been in existence.

“Happily for us, it was a wrong number,” he
said. “We have given out U.S.A. buttons to all our
members, and to our delight no one ever wears them
it seems that either they forget to put them on or
they feel it’s just too much trouble. At the football
games we carry signs with nothing printed on them;
that is, if we can get someone to carry them.

I then asked Bland what he thought the ulti-
mate purpose of his organization was. “It’s very easy
to answer that,” he replied with a yawn. “Too
many students come to college with a crazy sort of
wild-eyed idealism. They think they can change
the school and even the world.”

THEY THINK that by getting active in all sorts
of groups they are representing their generation and
its changing values and perceptions. But they’re
only kidding themselves. Everyone knows that stu-
dents don’t come to school to learn—they come to get
a diploma. Students aren’t supposed to react; they’re
supposed to melt in. It’s so much easier to be apa-
thetic than active. Our group wants to remind every-
one of these facts. By the way, pal, I think you’ve
taken enough of my time.”

“But where are you going?” I asked.
“Nowhere.”

“What are you going to do?”
i Nothing.”

 -- ' pus police are now wearing mace containers on their belts, and
‘C’ that these little black containers supposedly serve as a deter-
 rent——a visible sign to the students saying, “you must obey
the rules.” i

_ It is significant’ that a member of the University faculty
has said the campus police should not wear fire arms or con-
tainers of mace. David Houston said at a Faculty Senate meet-
ing that the University should try an experiment — an experi-
ment to find out if firearms or chemical mace serve as det-
errents to “foul play.” Houston says “suppose for one year
we disarm our University police and examine the effect.” This
is a very rational and empirical way examining various sec-
urity questions and methodologies that the University has been
pondering for years. Houston’s experiment is a very rational
and responsible way of eradicating an unnecessary figment of
University security.

Firearms and mace are unnecessary here simply because
the students have a great respect for the campus police. The
- campus police are men of understanding and patience-men who
calmly pursue their duties from day to day. They are a credit to
the University. There unique position of responsibility and

trust negates the need to carry a revolver or chemical mace.

The ideal situation on campus is one in which the se-
curity personnel do not carry incapacitating deterrents. In
. quest for this ideal situation, we endorse David Houston’s

, realistic proposal, and urge Chancellor Posvar to call for the
complete disarming of our University security personnel.

. The campus is calm, why not insure its tranquility.

C Alumnus"aRaps Levenson Column

Editor, The Pitt News:

In his column in Friday’s Pitt
News, Bruce Levenson displays a
political and journalistic imma-
turity far beyond his years.

Inherent in his tone is a dis-
respect, not only for the politi-
cal candidates but for his readers.
In attempting to mock the presi-
dential contenders, Mr. Levenson
succeeds only in mocking his own
feebleattempts at any sort of rea-
soned coherent analysis.

Mr. Levenson’s tactic is to try
and poke fun at the candidates. But
it is not the biting satire of Art
Buchwald, or‘ even Marc Simon,
whose column appeared in the
same issue.

Instead, Mr. Levenson wallows
in meaningless buffoonery, a
tactic often resorted to by those
who lack the intellectual ability
to make a reasonablle argument.

In resorting to the use of “Tric- .

ky Dicky Nixon,” and “Hubert
Horatio Humpty Dumpty, ”
Mr. Levenson attempts to mock
the candidates but succeeds only
in mocking himself. If the only
political attacks he can make are
those of name-calling, then I sug-
gest that he hang up his type-
writer for good.

Finally in his only attempt at
displaying. any kind of facts to
back up his ramblings, Mr. Le-
venson proves once more thathe

knows very little of what he speaks.

As a matter of fact, Richard Nix-
on captured every Republican pri-

mary except one, Massachusetts.
Mr. Levenson would lead us to
believe. that Nixon lost every one.

But this misstatement of the fact
i was to be expected, considering

the rest of Mr. Levenson’s column,
which seemed to have been spawn-
ed in a sewer. I therefore find
it pleasing that Mr. Levenson‘s
choice for President should be a
pig, not only because they pro-
bably- share a common intellect,

but because they can share the mud

where both seem to enjoy wallow-

Student Hits Health Service

Editor,The Pitt News;

This afternoon, Sunday, I at-
tempted to place a call to the Stu-
dent Health Service in order to
inquire about what may have been
a serious condition. After ringing
the Service twice and being told
the line was busy, and twice
more and being told there was no
answer, —I called the Towers’
desk. I was informed" someone was
on duty at all times at the dispen-
sary.

Two more calls resulted in two
more “no answers.” I then asked
the operator if there wasn’t some
other number for the Service,
and was told that the problem was
that either no one was on duty,
or no one would answer the phone
during most of the-hours on Sun-
day.

Rosenblum Criticized Again

Editor, The Pitt News:

All right, Rosenblum. You’ve
gone far enough. A few issues
ago I said I liked your original
J.E.W.I.S.H. article. Being spicy
and satirical I thought it was
a clever change from factual dul-
lness. But my congratulation, plus
those of others, and your own damn
stubborness went to your head.

Your latest “work” is, in short,
disgusting. Maybe its okay to spoof
a religion or race. Some of the best
Italian jokes come from the Ital-
ians. Some of the best racial jokes

' "-come from Top Negro comedians.

spoof "God (who, incidentally, is
on éverybody’s side).

There’s a pretty good book out
—-a best seller, and it’s not been
ridiculed or satired much until
your second work of nonsense was
miscreated. I believe it’s called
the bible. Not bad — ever read it?
I doubt it. Now, I’m no religious
fanatic or anything but I do know
something sacriligious when I see
it, and that latest piece of shit of
yours takes first prize.

The operator, who would identi-
fy herself only as “Betty,” said “I
haven’t been able to reach them
all day.” When pressed further,
Betty told me that she thought
that this had always been the poli-
cy at the University on Sundays.

I called again, and another op-
erator first demanded to know if
I were a Doctor, then, after much
delay, referred me to Presbyter-
ian Hospital.

The booklet Student Health Ser-
vice and Insurance Plan states on
page one, “Student Health Ser-
vice personnel are available, at
all times for emergency care ex-
cept for injuries. Occasionally,

the personnel are not there, so you —

may wish to call in advance of
an emergency visit‘ to find out if
someone is there to help you. If

you get noanswer, check with the I
University switchboard,”'which is '

supposed to know what to do.

Had my illness been critical, in-
stead of merely serious, I could
have died and been buried before
could have reached the Health
Service or found out the alterna-
tives.

action, I fully intend to_raise as

E ter maids have no way of knowing

  

Pitt News Feature

by CORA RICHARDSON

' “Meter maids are as fair in the
issuing of parking tickets as their
duty permits,” said Robert Mar-
trano, supervisor for the Depart-
ment of Public Safety, Bureau of
Traffic Planning. “If a meter
goes into violation,” he contin-
ued, “while the meter maid is

[standing there, she won’t immedi-

ately tag the car. She in most
cases will continue to check the
remaining cars on her route. Nat-
urally, she will issue a ticket if
upon returning the car is still in
violation.”

Another policy of the meter
maids is that if the owner of a car
returns while a ticket is being
written, the meter maid is usually
reasonable enough to forego the
ticket, but probably with a word
of warning added. “But, don’t ex-
pect to leave your car parked in
violation all day and return to it
and find no ticket,” Martrano
added.

Martrano emphasized that the
University students must remem-
ber that they are not the only ones
to use these parking spaces. Me-

whether or not a car belongs to a
University student, or for how
long a car has been over-parked.
“Even if they did,” Martrano
said, “they have a job to do.

LITTLE MAN

“Privileges cannot be extended
to one special group, and where
the law is concerned, very seldom
are there any privileges given at
all, ‘laws are law,” he went on,

“and they must be obeyed by all; —

University students included.”
Martrano hinted that there is

only one way to avoid conflict be-

tween the student and the meter
maids. If the student doesn’t want
a parking ticket, he should check
on his car after class, if he thinks
his time has just about expired.
“This is the student's responsibil-
ity, ” Martrano concluded.

NSA Offers Many Services,
Strives To Help Students

The National Student Association has many services available to "
university students. These services are available at low cost and some

are free to student.s

One of these services includes a Life Insurance program which;
provides students with insurance at low rates while enrolled in col-

lege or graduate school.

Another service is a job placement program called Re-Con which,"
is free to students. It provides graduate students and seniors with a na-
tion-wide choice of jobs inlall types of careers.

Pan-Hel Preview Presents Greeks

by VIRGINIA PADUONO

Each year the campus sororities
present Pan-Hellenic Preview, an
informational seminar. The pur-
pose is to acquaint women stu-
dents of the University with the
functions of sororities. The Pre-
view also introduces freshmen and
transfer students to Greek life.

These goals were expressed by
Devra_ Kimball, president of the
Pan-Hellenic Assoication. She de
cribed the aim of Pan-Hellenic
Preview as an attempt “to change

' groups of Greek letters into groups

of people. ”

“Sororities give the University
the feel of a smaller, closer knit
campus,” contended one Greek.

One sorority sister asserted the

concept that sororities are espe-
cially beneficial to commuters.
“It gives them an opportunity to
feel more a part of the University
and to make more friends,” she
stated.

The Preview program consisted
of a skit performed by the men-
bers of various sororities. This de-
picted suite life and the activities

the sisters sponsor. Following the
skit, observers visited booths rep-
resenting each sorority and chat-
ted with members of the sorori-
ties.

The Preview serves as a preli-
minary for the sorority open hous-
es and the rush parties. Open

Will you receive three? Maybe two?
The truth of the matter is that most
women only receive one . .
engagement ring. Now. if this is the
case, then the first one should be the
finest. That doesn't necessarily mean
it will cost a fortune. People have a
misconception about the cost of dia-
monds. The trick is to decide how
much you wish to spend and then
purchase a diamond which is actual-
ly worth that much. The sure way
to get a fine diamond for the amount
you wish to spend is to purchase it
from a reputable -jeweler. .
in whom you can have confidence.

Cantini Sculptures Memorial To Litchfield

On the podium outside the new
Common Facilities Building on
Forbes Ave. stands a metal and
crystal sculpture, “Ode to Space.”
The sculpture is the work of the
University professor of fine arts,
Virgil Cantini, and was given to
the University as a memorial to
its former chancellor, the late Ed-

ward H. Litchfield.
Professor Cantini began work on
the piece several years ago, but

because he usually has several.

works in progress at the same
time, he is unable to pinpoint how
long it took to complete it.

The piece weighs a ton, stands
some 14 or 15 feet high, and is

made of black metal. A. crystal
floating near the top of the ab-

stract design was meant to sym-
bolize life and education. “When
lights hit the crystal,” explained
Professor Cantini, “it causes a
constantly changing pattern like
the shifting facets of life and ed-
cation.

Bethlehem Steel

At the base of the sculpture is
a bronze plaque to memorialize
Dr. Litchfield, chancellor from
1955 to 1965. Dr. Litchfield died
in March, 1968, after his private
plane went down on Lake Michi-
gan.

The donor of the sculpture pre-
fers to remain anonymous.

Loop Course Interviews:

What is the Bethlehem Loop Course? It is our management development program for graduates

with bachelors’ or advanced degrees.

The course starts early in July with four weeks of orientation at our home offices in Bethlehem,
Pa. Loopers attend lectures on every phase of the corporation’s activities, and make almost daily

visits to a steel plant.

Steel Plant Loopers, who comprise a majority of the average loop class of 1.50 to 200 graduates, I
proceed to various plants where they go through a brief orientation program before beginning
their on-the-job training assignments. Within a short time after joining the course, most’ loopers.

are ready _for assignments aimed toward higher levels of management.

How about other loopers? Our Sales Department loopers (30 or so) remain at the home office for
about a year of training. Most are then assigned to district offices where they take over established

&1CCOUl'llS.

Fabricated Steel Construction loopers are trained in a drafting room,’ on a ﬁeld erection project,
in a fabricating shop, and in an engineering office. A looper’s ﬁrst work assignment is based on
interests and aptitudes disclosed during this program. ' .

Loopcrs in Accounting. Shipbuilding. Mining, Research, Traﬂic, Purchasing, Finance and Law,
General Services. and Industrial and Public Relations go through training programs tailored to

their types of work.

leading to the ballroom. The bad
part was that the show had been
sold out: therefore, all those who
had come expecting to buy tick-
est at the door were out of luck.

Tension between the entrepre-
neurs and the crowd was making
everything uptight and just plain
ruining anybody’s chance of hav-
ing a good time. A second show
was promised to those who could
not get into the first. but two cops
showed up and ordered, in not too
kindly terms, the non-ticket hold-
ers to the lobby, I decided to quit
it.”

Friday's drag was still on my
mind when I went to see “Les
Danseurs Africans” Saturday eve-
ning at the Carnegie Music Hall,
but the bad vibrations were soon
to clear. What took place that eve-
ning was a massive tribal freak-
out. I have never seen or heard
anything quite so remarkable be-
fore. Frantic movements, pulsat-
ing drums and ethereal chants
were pandemic. Never have I ex-
perienced so many strange and

complicated rhythms. . . . It was

truly a night of total involvement.
Such beautiful people. I got the
over all Impression that they could
have gone on forever. They were
doing their thing and really hated
to quit. And the’ audience loved
it.

The opening piece was a pro-
cession down the middle of the
theater onto the stage and, as in
just about every other piece from
here on, there were drums, drums,
and more drums. The men were
wearing head gear which resem-
bled that worn by ancient Trojan
warriors. Everyone was dancing.
The next section was called ‘L’ Oi-
seau Sacre,” ‘a tribute to the Sa-
cred Bird of the Bambara Tribes-
man.” The symbolic bird looked
like a mobile grass hut with a
beak and was ridden by a puppet
(an elf.) who was rather loquaci-
ous and also a bit of a comic.

What followed this was a four
piece drum dialogue on what are
called the Tam-Tams. The Tam-
Tam is a half an hour glass shaped
drum which is straddled by the
player. It has a monstrous sound

notes say, “is regarded as a living‘

give life to the dead and to drive
one’s enemies insane.” In true it"
really swings. One’s physical de-
velopment is of great concern to
the African tribesman and is easi-;
ly portrayed in the self-assured
style of “Les Acrobats.” The‘
aplomb and agility which these I
acrobats represent are enough to 
make even the most accomplish-
ed gymnast envious. Athletic’
contests are “frequently held in

tition is keen.”

gons.” The Dogons are one of the. .
few remaining tribes of Africa I
who still’ cling to the past tradi- I
tions. This was enactment of one
of their funeral rites. The body
of the dead person is carried
around on the heads of the young
men which symbolizes its “refus-
al to go to its last resting place.” ’
A battle takes place in dance
form between the survivors and-
the corpse. At the triumph of the
living, the dead are laid to rest. .

The second half of the program 7
was in large part devoted to the
“Presentation of the D,ogIo‘n,
Masks.” In the past these dances
were only performed in front of
the initiated members of the
tribe. The men wore bright red, _
yellow and black costumes, shift- '
ing masks according to that par-
ticular dance they were doing._
Some of the masks represented I
were those of “Zantegueba’.’ (aﬂ
nigh-mzirish lion with a red mane,
and white string mesh for fur), ;
“Le Grand Masque”. (a ten‘ foot‘-.-
wooden sabre which is worn on
the head and is swung toslap
against the front of the stage and '.
then the rear) and the “Dogon
Cow Mask” (complete with
horns).

The evening ended-with “The I
Dance of the Possessed,” a very .
dramatic frenzy with hysterics, 
convulsions, mystical appear- I
ances, incantations and a few ob-
vious bad trips. This was truly the .
most exciting event for the audi-*
ence. The drums were at their A
loudest, most infectious rhythms
and the dancers were doing their I
damnest to bring the house down.
At times the audience even got so‘
involved as to try to keep time»
with their clapping. And then a
really great thing happened. A;
man in a bow tie - suit config-
uration walked on stage with an?
armful of roses and while being
jostled by the dancers distributed_
them to the now frantic women. ‘
It just didn’t seem real. Like no- I
body wanted them to stop. As all
the performers were taking their
final bows, five or so drummers
were holding a jam session with V
the Tam-Tams. I really don’t *
know who enjoyed themselves the-
most, the audience or the per- ,
formers.

Fallingwater Trip

The Student Union Board will
sponsor its semi—annual excur-
sion to Fallingwater, the famous
house designed by Frank Lloyd
Wright, Sunday, October 12. A
limited number of tickets are now
on sale at the Union Information
Center, priced at $3.

A ticket entitles the purchaser
to bus transportation, ‘a lunch,
and the tour. .Busses will leave
from the Fifth Avenue entrance
of the Student Union at 10:30,
112001 and 11:30.

Fallingwater, one of Frank
Lloyd Wright’s most widely ac-
claimed works, was designed in
1936 for Pittsburgh store own-
er Edgar J. Kaufman. The site of
the famous house was the Kauf-
mann family’s weekend and sum-
mer retreat in the Bear Run Val-
ley of Fayette County, Pennsyl-
vania.

Wrirht was intrigued by the
Bear Run area which combined
the beauty of a mature forest,
massive sandstone boulders, a
wild free-flowing stream, and a
forest understory covered with

native rhododendron, laurel, and

typical Appalachian wild flowers.
The key to this setting is the

waterfall over which the house
is built. The falls had been a focal
point of the family’s activities,
and they had indicated the area
around the falls as the location for
a home. They were unprepared
for the architect’s suggestion that
the house rise over the waterfall
rather than looking at it. But the
-architect’s original scheme was
adopted almost without change.
The house, completed with guest
and service wing in 1939, was con-
structed with sandstone quarried
on the property and laid up by lo-
cal craftsmen. The stone serves
to separate reinforced concrete
“trays,” forming living and bed-
room levels, dramatically canti-
levered over the stream. ‘

Since the opening of Falling-
water to the public in the summer
of 41964, more than 135,000 visi-
tors have toured this famous
house through the Western Penn-
sylvania Conservancy’s cultural
and educational program.

The house tours ‘are conducted
by tour leaders selected for their
knowledge of art and‘ architec-
ture and their ability to convey the
exciting concepts of Fallingwa-
ter to pe4sons of widely varied

Defensive Ends Switch Targets

  Penetrating

Pass Rush
Stops WSLM

by MARTHA I-IARTLE

In holding William and
Mary to three points Satur-
day, the Panther defense
finally displayed the aggres-
siveness which had been lack-
ing in the first twocontests. And
defensive ends Bob Ellis and Paul
Naponick led that agressive charge
which buried the Indian quarter-
back behind the line fourteen
times.

Both, Ellis and Naponick ex-
plained that a switch from a
containing to a penetrating type of
defense was the ' major reason
for the improvement of their
play.

“It’s true we were laying back
in the first two contests,” noted
Ellis,”. so the coaches changed
the strategy to get a more aggres-
sive defense. We were told to go in
as hard as we could and concen-
trate on rushing the passer.”

“We changed defensive end
play in order to make it more pen-

so-.‘

etrating instead of containing,”
added Naponick. “Instead of the
ends containing as before, we
penetrated and put pressure on
the passer. The secondary was
then responsible for contain-
ment.”

Both boys -agreed that the de-

fense finally played up to its po-
tential Saturday. “I think we had
the ability to play this way all
season,” commented Ellis, “and
we finally put it together this
week. We finally want out and
played the way we should have.” '

“The guys decided they wanted
to go out and play; we were tired
of losing,” added Naponick_.

Although neither Ellis nor Na-
ponick would express satisfaction
with their personal performances
against William and Mary,
they both admitted improvement
over the first two games.

‘ “You’re never satisfied with
yourself,” quipped Naponick,
“But I think I was improved over
the past few weeks.”

“I was a little more satisfied
than in the first two games,”
agreed Ellis. “I stunk up the field
in the first two, but I relaxed on
Saturday and felt I did a better

1

job. But I can do much Better.”

With Syracuse coming up this
weekend, the defense will have
to continue the aggressive play
it displayed Saturday. Naponick
and Ellis expect a tough game,
but both are confident of contain-
ing the Syracuse offense.

“We did it last year,” explain-
ed Paul, “and I think we can do it
again. The fullback they have now
is not Larry Csonka.”

“Syracuse is noted for its big
backs, but they’ve been passing
a lot more this year too,” added
Ellis. But we will look for power
running and we have a special de-
fense like we used last year a-
gainst Csonka. It worked last year,
so we’ll try it again. We’ll pro-
bably use more men on the line,
maybe five or six.”

“This isn’t a typical Syracuse
team, however,” continued Na-
ponick. ” They’re passing this year
and rounding the corners. I im-
agine we’ll face a more balanced
attack.”

But whatever type of attack
Syracuse comes up with, defen-
sive ends Paul Naponick and Bob
Ellis hope to penetrate it —— ag-
gressively.

A .proyement.—’ ’_._ L

  

by ART ROSENGARTEN T ,
With a renewed spirit and enthusiasm and that all-important
first victory under their belts, the Panther, gridders returned
to practice for their first meeting with a top Eastern power,
Syracuse. -

“It was a most gratifying win,” said Coach Dave Hart. “I’m I /

expecially pleased with the general improvement of the team.”

After viewing the game films, Hart -was extremely pleased with
the performance of the offensive line. “Those boys moved the opponent
cosistently off the line‘ of scrimmage and established a new one fur-
ther up the field. This was the firs t time that happened since I’ve been
here.”

When the offense rested, the defensive wquad continued the mom-
entum. A defensive rush, something that has been very scarce at Pitt
Stadium, was so effective that it dropped William and Mary’s quarter-
backs 14 times. Leading the charge were defensive ends Paul Naponick
and Bob Ellis. 1

Even with the improvements, Coach Hart and his staff still have
to cut down on the number of mistakes that the Panthers make, both
offensively and defensively. V

As against West Virginia, the offensive squad was penalized much
too often for either off-side or illegal procedural penalties. Most of
the time these offset a fine play or interrupted a scoring drive.

Hart feels that these penalties are due to “the anxiety of the boys in
anticipating the snap and the long. counts and cadence of quarter-
back Dave Havern.”

Hart also feels that his offensive squad must learn how to capital-
ize on opponent’s mistakes_ So far this season, the Panthers have waisted
many fine scoring opportunities with mistakes of their won and missed
field goals.

Against the defense, the Panther opponents have been able to ex-
ecute successfully the important third down play. Expecially disturb-
ing to Hart has been the inability of the defense to stop the third down
and long yardage situations. .

Punt returns, something the Panthers haven't had, are going to be
practived this week, with the emphasis being switched from an attempt
at blocking theypunt to a long return of it. -

Looking back on Saturday’s win, Dave Hart feels that “the win will
give‘ the boys a tremendous" lift and

 

help bring about immediate im- ‘

the scrimmages,” said frosh foot-
ball coach Carl Kokor. “They

know that it's their chance to ‘

hit back.”

The Cubs do hit back, and so
scrimmaging the varsity becomes
happiness for Kokor also.

“The attitude of these kids is
great,” commented Kokor. “And
the fact that they get a chance
to hit, builds the morale of the
team.”

Kokor also benefits from the
scrimmage in that he gets to
see the freshmen play as, one de-
fensive unit.

“They looked real good to-
day,” beamed Kokor Monday.
“They missed a couple of tack-
les, but I’d rather see them miss

tackles than see them in the wrong

positions.”

“That was only the second time
the freshmen were able to defend
against the pass play in a live
situation,” added assistant frosh
coach John Rosenberg. “So it was
helpful.”

Aged Hawks
Forfiet First
AlumniGame

by WILLIE BAXT

Sunday’s first Hawks-Hawks
Alumni football game never
took place. As expected, the
aging alumni didn’t show up.

“We knew this was going to
happen,” said Hawks coach Roy
“Jumpshot” Jacobs. “They al-
ways were yellow.”

Only one alumni player, Mike‘

“Hawk” Brourman showed up
for the big game. But the veteran
linebacker couldn’t outrun an un-
hatched chicken if he had a lit
fire cracker in the seat of his
pants.

“If only five other alumni
showed up, we'd murder the
Hawks,” moaned “Hawk.”

“You mean six. (ion ’ t you?"

jeered Hawk sp_lit-end Jerry
“LeRoy” Gruebel. “You have to
have six players on the field.”

Pre—season scouting picked
“Hawk” as honorable mention
all-East water boy. But another
forfiet could hurt his chances.

The Hawks-Hawks Alumni
game has been rescheduled for
Saturday morning, October 25, be-
fore the varsity hosts Air Force.
The field will be announced 1
minute before game-time, if that
soon.

Talent, Optimism In ’68;

Schalk Show

by ED CONLEY

Mike Schalk lost his starting
post at fullback for the varsity
soccer team in the last few games
of the season a year ago. He does
not want to do that again.

In a somewhat comfortable pos-
ition this fall. Schalk explained
how he can avoid being a sub: “.1
didn’t play well my first two
games. .but I abandoned all sorts
of caution and played like I
should against Slippery Rock."

His coach Leo Bemis. agrees
that the fullback is a better play-
er than he was a year ago.

“He has shown some improve-
ment. It's hard to say how —a
year’s maturity, maybe,” the coach
said. - »

The coach continued, “He’s
playing up to capacity when he’s
out there; he’s a hustler.”

The back from Rochester, New
York insists, that he really didn’t
play his type of ’ game until last
Saturday.

lllllllllllllllllllllllllllllIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIE

Paul Zink, one of only two veteran harriers, has a bright new

outlook for the 1968 season.

Zink remarked that he was sick most of last year and didn’t
do much of anything. But, this season he has already chopped
59 seconds off his best cross country time from last year.

“I’m—much stronger this year. There’s no comparison,” Zink com-

mented. He has given coach Banner much of the credit for his impro-
vement. Zink exclaimed, “I’ve really been surprised that I’ve been in

new methods have helped us.”

Last year the squad ran four
one-mile distances with five min-
ute intervals. This season, about
once a week, the team runs six-
one-mile distances with two min-
tue intervals. Thus, Zink reports
that this fall he’s felt much bet-
ter in practice. “Our practices
give us a chance to relax and de-
velop a pace,” Zink indicated.

In the threemeets thus far, Zink
has demonstrated his continual
improvement. He finished sec-
ond among his squad in the first
two meets and tied for first place
in the third meet. Paul stated that
he had the flu before the Buf-
falo meet, and that he’s happy
with his fourth place finish.

Zink commented. “I was just
six seconds behind the third run-
ner. and I know I could’ve done
better. In high school I used to
beat Bowling Green's Sid Sink
(Sink finished in second place)."
At Cleveland he didn’t believe
that he was well enough to finish
the race. however. once he began

_ such good shape. We’re running two practices a day, and coach Banner’s

running, he zipped through the
course and into a first place tie.

Moreover, Zink rated the up-
coming Notre Dame Invitational
as very rough, Notre Dame won
last year, and Miami (0.) is also
highly regarded. “The Mid-Amer-
ica Conference schools are going
to be tough, but we’ll finish in the
top three and maybe win it,’.’ Zink
said.

In addition, he indicated the
team is really pointing for the
Penn State meet. Zink remarked,
“It’ll be our toughest dual meet. .
I think we can beat them.”

After the Penn State meet, Zink
indicated that the IC4A’s will be
a real test for the harriers. He
rated both Georgetown and Vill-
anova as fearsome competition.

Despite the excellent oppon-
ents scheduled ahead, Zink sees
the team morale as sky-high.“He
commented, “We’ve got a good‘§,~_t-
itude. We’ve been’ winning, and
we’re going to keep it that way.”

He said, “It’s all sort of strange:
Vinnie’s (assistant coach Vince
Bartolotta) been harassing me.
I thought that he was just being
vicious, but after the Slippery
Rock game he came up and said,
‘Good game.’ It was the best thing
I’d heard in weeks.”

Boaters Face
Three-Game
Week Soon

With their first win and some
goals behind them, the var-
sity soccer team is now pre-
paring for their busiest week
of the season. '

They’l1 play three games in
eight days starting Saturday, the
day they travel to Philadelphia
to take on Temple.

The team seems to be far ahead
of the point they were at two
weeks ago. “They know they can
win‘, now,” coach Leo Bemis rea-
soned.

“They’re getting their timing
and the heads are getting bet-

, ter, _too,” he continued.

He thinks that this was evident
in the victory at Slippery Rock,
Saturday.

He mentions, “Strategically,
we used our wings; we didn’t
"play dumb by keeping the ball in
the middle.

“However,” h e s aid , “We’re
going to have to have the players
look for the outside men sooner
than they have been.”

The play in the win impressed
the mentor greatly. “They des-
erved to win. From the opening
whistle they wanted it,” he sta-
ted.

Bemis thinks there is also a bit;
more to Schalk’s improvement-than"-
avoiding caution. He feels th 
booter, plays a much better head‘-,
ing game than a year ago, and is-.:
impressed by the development of
the kicker’s left foot. In fact, _.
Bemis relates, “He didn’t even}
have a left foot when he started.”; 

The coach sums up his views‘?
on Schalk by saying, “Mike will:
hang in there; he'll make up for‘
any limitations he may have.” '

“Three of the four fullbacks
are from, Western New York, f,
that’s why we shut them out/A’;
he claims. ‘ 

Actually, Schalk" thinks that‘.-
the fact that Bemis used fourﬂ
fullbacks is what contributed ‘to.
the blanking. _ _,

“I don’t know if it's the best?‘
way, but it sure helped me. I:
guess I like it because I'm a full-7
back,” he stated. .

Then, after a moment’s thought
he decided, “Maybe we did it be .
cause we were tired of exercises.” ’

The fullback, like most of his:
teammates, thinks the team is—'.:
betterthan a year ago, thanks to j_
the condition the players are in.-1,’:
In fact, he predicts a lot mor
wins this year. A "

Mike’s pretty good at predict-
ing, too. He mentions, “With”?
five minutes left, I was so sure.
of the win Saturday I started
mentally counting up the towels‘.

Investigate
Specimens

Dr. Bruce W. Hapke, associate
professor of planetary physics at
the University, has been desig-
nated by NASA as one of appro-
ximately 100 scientists to examine
samples of the lunar surface
which will be’ collected on the
first Apollor flight to land on the

_ moon.

Dr. Hapke will be assisted in
this investigation by two of his
colleagues in the Department of
Earth and Planetary Sciences —
Dr. Alvin J. Cohen, professor of
geochemistry, and Dr. William
Cassidy, associate professor of
meteoritics. They will conduct
their studies in the laboratories
of Pitt’s Space Research Coordi-
nation Center.

From their investigations, the
team hopes to theorize on the
causes of the lunar surface’s lack
of color and the layered structure
of its soil. These phenomena were
observed in the television pic-
tures taken by the Surveyor ve-

. hicles which first landed on the

_ moon two years ago.
Dr. Hapke has been on the Pitt

I faculty since last fall.
