e Pittsburgh Collegians Peacefully I
Protest US Policy In Vietnam
With Silent Peace Vigils Here-

._\‘.‘‘I,.

by IVAN ABRAMS ,
Every Wednesday since Feb. 1,
from noon to 1 p.m., a silent vigil
for peace is held in front of the
Stephen Foster Memorial on
Forbes Ave.

The vigil, the second of two
vigils in Pittsburgh, was original-
ly composed mainly of members
of the American Friends Service
Comm-.ittee. It now includes stu-
dents and faculty from the area
colleges and anyone else who
wishes to join and demonstrate
his disapproval of United States
policy in Vietnam.

According to Dr. Stanley Shos-
tak, assistant professor of biology
at the University and one of the
regular participants in the vigils,
“The line is not only for people
of certain religious beliefs but
for anyone who believes that
something positive can be done
to. protest.” Dr. Shostak stated
that the purpose of the vigil is.
to create an atmosphere in which

"debate can be meaningful by

making the point of View repre-
sented more commonplace.

“Theme is a similarity to the
civil rights movement,” be con-
tinued. “The actual accomplish-
ments of civil rights picketing
have been slight. But they have
served to make the public aware
of the Negroes’ struggles. We
hope to make the public aware
of the wide-spread opposition to
the war.”

In general, those who support
the vigil call for the United
States to cease bombing in Viet-
nam and to begin negotiations for

_ peace. Their intention is to con-

tinue their protest until Ameri-
cans stop killing and being killed
in Southeast‘ Asia.

Activity
(See Edz'to7~ial—“A New Role for

M en’s Cowncil—Page 4_)

The ‘Recognitions Committee
decided Tuesday to scrutinize the
function of Men’s Council, and
suggested its activities be speci-
ﬁcally stipulated.

Basil Zitelli presented the new
Men’s «Council Constitution for
discussion. He commented that
Men’s Council had never really
operated under the speciﬁcations
of its old constitution. It was
noted during the discussion that
Men’s Council has no direct con-
stituency.

To clarify the’ Council’s man-
date, Anne Baker suggested that
the future Men’s Council hold
University-wide elections for all
male students, similar to the As-
sociated Women Students elec-
tions.

Ken Frederick brought out that
some of Men’s Council’s activities
conﬂict with Student Govern-
ment’s, such as Transfer Day and
Freshman Orientation. He sug-
gested that the jurisdiction and
scope of activity of Men's Coun-
cil be speciﬁcally outlined.

-In this regard, Mike Weingar-
ten moved that Men’s Council
be temporarily recognized until
Oct. '2, by which time speciﬁc
proposals concerning campus-
wide elections and clariﬁcations
of specific powers must be in-
cluded in the Constitution and
submitted to the Recognitions
Committee for review.

Tris - State Area Engineers Hold 
Soil Mechanics Seminar at Pitt

More than 250 tri-state area en-

gineers recently attended the

ﬁrst in a series _of seminars on
the latest developments in “soil
mechanics”-—the study of what
happens to soil when you build
on it or dig through it.

The ﬁrst seminar concerned ‘

problems associated with the con-
struction of shallow foundations,
which are the kind used for more
than two-thirds of the buildings
in the region, such as residences,
shopping centers, churches,
schools, and buildings other than
large office and industrial struc-
tures.

THOMAS SACKS‘
Heads Evaluation Project

The Liberal Arts Cabinet will
conduct a course evaluation week
beginning Monday, according to
Tom Sacks, chairman of the Cab-
inet.

The seminars are sponsored by
the Soil Mechanics and Founda-
tions Group of the Pittsburgh
Section, American Society of Civ-
il Engineers. They are being co-
ordinated by Dr. Archie M. Rich-
ardson, associate professor of
civil engineering in the School of
Engineering. at the University,
and are being held in the Grad-
uate School of Public Health Au-
ditorium. The University has the
region’s largest graduate train-

‘ing program in soil mechanics.

To Remedy. Apartheid Policy

The apartheid racial pol-
icy of the South African
government deprives non-

the opportunity to gain all

South African student who

recently visited the Univers-

To overcome this, a re-

According to the student, who
prefered to stay anonymous, non-
white South Africans, under the
apartheid policy, are forced to
attend inferior and unacceptable
colleges where students are sub-
jected to racist indoctrination and
continual political police surveil-
lance.

The fund drive will provide
money for a WUS program, the

',i_:_National Draft c

WASHINGTON, D. C.,
(CPS) — proponents of vol-
._ untary nati-onal service have
is attacked the reports of two
government panels studying
the draft fortheir failure to
consider voluntary work as an
. alternative to conscription.

Eighteen leaders of student or-
ganizations have informed the
President by telegram that they
are “appalled that the two advi-
. sory groups make no provision
in their recommendations for a
move toward voluntary national
service.”‘

The youth group leaders, rep-
T ._resenting political and religious
organizations, had called for
abolition of the draft at a Feb-
ruary meeting sponsored by Mod-
erator magazine.

In their. statement to the Pres-
ident, the students commented,
“It seems ‘incredible to us that-
(the two investigating bodies)
;_ fail to propose any realistic pro-
‘grams for signiﬁcantly extending
,. voluntary service in either the
armed forces or in non-military,
‘_ humanitarian programs.” O
 Heavy criticism was directed
C. at the report of the President’s
National Advisory Commission on
Selective Service, headed by for-
mer Assistant Attorney General
Burke Marshall. The students

: charged that the Marshall Com-
” mision’s recommendation “are_a
‘ grab-bag of stop-gap measures
designed to alleviate certain in-
‘ ‘equities at the cost of further en-
7 trenching and exacerbating the
‘impact of conscription.”

Stated the youth leaders, “The
Commission recommendations, if.
._‘implemented, mean the perpetua- *
T tion of a system which debases
7 “human dignity and deprives young
Americans of their freedom.”

signers of the statement in-
cluded officers of the College
Young Democrats, the Young Re-
publican National Federation, the
-YMCA Student Council, and the
_' University Christian Movement.
One of the recommendations of
. Tithe‘ Marshall Commission was the
‘abolition of student deferments.‘
’ n a statement to Congress, the

 -Page 2 — THE rrrr NEWS —'-:_F‘1-iday, 1iIl:ar'chi‘1i.(‘l';,’l!iti7 Y

Groups Attack Panels

President announced that he was
partially implementing that sug-
gestion.

An executive order to be issued.
in the near future will abolish
deferments for graduate students,
unless those students are attend-
ing medical or dental school. The
President stated that “student de-
ferments have resulted in in-
equities because many-of those
deferments 'h'ave pyramided into
exemptions from military serv-
1ce.”

Other major points in the Pres-
ident’s message included the in-

, duction of men beginning at age

19, “reversing _the present order
of calling the oldest first, so that
uncertainties now generated in
the lives of young men will be
reduced;” uniform rules for de-
terming non-student deferments;
and the establishment of a lottery
system of “fair and impartial ran-
dom” (FAIR) to determine the
order of call for eligible men.

Additionally, the President call-

"ed for immediate improvement

of the Selective Service System
“to assure better service to the
registrant both in counseling and

‘ appeals, better information to the

public regarding the System’s op-_
eration and broader representa-
tion on local boards of the com-
munities they serve.”

J ohnson’s recommendations also
include the continuation of the
Marshall Commission for another
year, “to provide" a continuing
review of the system that touches
the lives of so many young Amer-
icans and their families.”

In his message on the draft,
the President also suggested that
“enlistment procedures for our
National Guard and Reserve units
be strengthened to remove in-
equities and to -ensure a high
state of readiness for those units.”

The President praised the work
of young Americans who, through
service, in such programs as
VISTA and the Peace Corps,
“have touched, and perhaps even"
changed the life of our country
and our world.”

, It was comforting to see the Student Government Recognitions
. Committee has taken a new attitude towards its purpose and goals, The
-.-recent actions of the Recognitions Committee concerning‘ Men’s Council
-show. that in the future it can serve as an advisory body which aid
campus groups in strengthening and enriching their programs. '

G‘ ' Since its inception, the Recognitions Committee was looked upon
-"by some students as a control group which would only permit certain
7“s'a‘fe” organizations to be recognized by the University. However, in re-
'cent'months the Recognitions Committee has begun to review the Con.-
..stitutions of all recognized organizations to try and ascertain whether
‘,:these groups are fulﬁlling the function for which they were originally

human beings ‘

.a system which takes a man. .

_ One of the groups which particularly needed review was the Men’s
1-Council, Supposedly this is one of the major organizations on campus and
the president sits with the president of Student Government, Interfrater-
-nity Council, Men’s Dormitory Council, etc. on the Student Affairs Com-
mittee and the Chancellor’s Advisory Committee. It is supposed to be
the over-all governing body for men at the University as Associated
to Women Students (AWS) is for co-eds. .
‘ ' However, in -‘recent years it has limited its activities to those of-

Vietnam War Opposed

Philosophy of Draft Denied G

‘ ent groups of people have

joined together at different

times to form societies with .

different sets of laws. It is
for these unfortunate facts
that human beings come into
conflict with each other.

When one group of peo-
ple attempt to force its will
on another, then it may be
necessary to resist. In some
cases it will not be necessary
to require men to ﬁght for
their country because they
will realize the consequences
of not ﬁghting. For example,
the British did not have to
employ conscription for the
ﬁrst three years of World
War I. . s

In other cases_the conse-
quences of not ﬁghting are
not that clear, To my know-
ledge the people of Vietnam
have no desire to enforce

aid because we are God’s
chosen people, let us examine
the facts. _
EXCEPT FOR a handful
of South Koreans and Aus-
tralians, no other free world
power has troops in Viet-
nam. Why haven’t our tradi-
ditional Allies —— like the
French, British, Canadians,
and other 40 or so countries
which fought the Axis—sent
troops to Vietnam? Isn’t it
just remotely possible that
the'United States is wrong?
It is difficult to believe»
that a country could‘ have
over 500,000 troops half way

‘ around the as a friendly ges- .

ture to a friendly people. It
is quite clear that American
troops are -doing an awfully

. large amount of ﬁghting.

I am quite aware that Com-

munist nations are sending.

supplies to the North Viet-.
namese and Viet Cong, but
they are not sending their
own people to die in Viet-
nam. Since our government
reports there areabout 600,-
000 loyal South Vietnamese
troops ﬁghting a small min-
ority of Viet Cong, aided by
several divisions of North

_Vietnamese regulars, why

can’t it be enough that we

just ‘supply the guns and

bombs?

I BELIEVE it is unfortu-
nate that the ones who want
to rid themselves of foreign
domination call themselves

communists. I personally—

don’t believe the average

Vietnamese peasant knows ’

the difference between Marx-
ism and a hole in the ground.
The Russian-‘Chinese dispute,
and the growing peaceful-
coexistence type relations
with the Soviet Union and
Eastern European Commun-
ist countries indicate that

there is a chance for peace. —

For those people who in
their hearts know (like Gold-
water) that the Communist
imperialists want to take our
land, then I suggest these
people inform _ their draft
boards that they are ready
to go to Vietnam. The proof
of the pudding is in_t_he eat-

Student Criticizes
‘War Mongers’

Editor, The Pitt News:

I was very much impressed by’

Mr. Weiss’ March 6 letter to the
Pitt News, but not favorably. I
grant that some of the statements
in Ivan Abrams’ column lacked
logical foundations. However, I
would rather ._ surround. myself
with illogical humanists than
with logical, insensitive war mon-
gers. Once upon a time 2,000
years ago, someone said, “Do

unto others as you would have

them do unto you.” I don’t be-
lieve this is a misquote of “Do
unto others that they won’t be
able to do unto you,” or simply
“Do unto others!” -
What did. Mr. Weiss say that
I have found so disturbing? “Na-
palm does it (kills) a bit more
efficiently, thereby saving Allied
lives‘. Is this Wrong?”
I would like ‘to ask him, is this
right? Personally, I would have
_ had little indecision 25 years ago,
had I been of age _then and asked
to ﬁght. Then, I would have seen
~ the necessity of taking one life
‘ now‘ so that I would not have to
later take two or more lives in or-
"der to protect myself and those
persons and precepts I hold dear.
But even under these circum-
stances, I would not have felt

that killing-a man in a different

colored uniform was morally
right, as such, or perfectly justi-
ﬁable, only necessary. ' -

Am I to believe that Vietna-
mese women and children pose
the same threats as did the Wehr.
macht? Killing of unarmed civili-
ans is neither necessary, nor jus-
tifiable, and assuredly is not
right. Under the circumstances it
may be unavoidable, but all the
more reason to alter those cir-
cumstances. ,

Mr. Weiss earnestly (I think")
presumes that America? is “. . .
helping S. Vietnam and the rest
of Southeast Asia keep free of

' military enforced communist dom-

ination . . .” This is not fortunate,
bu.t_ unfortunate. I also" question
that "“most of us” share his sen-
timents. At this time, I am not
going to argue whether we should
or should not have become in-
volved. I will say that I am dis-
satisﬁed with’ the nature of our
involvement and its continuation
and expansion. I think -the Viet-
nam problem can be solved by

other means, and further that"

a service organization, sponsoring Transfer Day with AWS and organizing
Freshmen Men’s Council, Men’s Freshmen Orientation, and Men’s Fresh-
men Camp. It has performed these functions effectively but has shown
little imagination in’ building new programs. Also it has clearly lacked
the intangible respect of the men of the University. Many of the male stu-
dents are not even aware that this council exists. .

"One of the reasons for the lack of this respect is that all men of
the University do not elect the officers of Men’s Council. (There are cam-
pus wide elections in \which w-omen vote for the officers of AWS.) The
members of ‘the previous year’s Men’s ‘Council ‘elect the officers for next
year. This self-perpetuating mechanism inevitably weakened the organiza-

The Recognitions Committee wisely pointed -out that Men’s Coun-
cil must further deﬁne its role on campus and it must make provisions
‘for campus-wide elections. As was pointed out, many of Men’s Council’s
custodial duties such as orientation do conflict with the duties of Student
Government. It cannot continue to be considered one of the major organi-
zations if its duties are limited to these activities. Men’s Council badly
needed help and rather than shoot holes in a sinking ship, the Recognition
Committee decided to give this group some sound advice.

objective.

Out of curiosity, I wo-uld like
to ask Mr. Weiss, on the assump-
tion that he honestly sees our
cause as one for noble democratic
goals, why he is here and not
over there.

Since Mr. Weiss mentioned lu-
dicrous logic, what does he think
of his own reasoning in defend-
ing our use of napalm on the
grounds that we “are the only
major ‘nation presently involved
in an open conﬁict” and because
the Egyptians use poison gas in
Yemen. If consistent, he would
also argue that since each of us
has the potential to maim and,
mutilate, the‘ person who answers
opposition by maiming and muti-
lating is unquestionably justiﬁed.
And Mr. Weiss also would prob-
ably insist that any wrong is al-
right if a precedent has been set.

If only Mr. Weiss had‘ con.-
tradicted some of Mr. Abrams’
statements with documented evi-
dence and authoritative facts, ra-
ther than with none too reliable
conjecture. -

Yes sir, it does take two to
make a war, and the innocent
most certainly suffer in war, but
that we are allowing this war to
be waged and all the undetach-
able suffering to occur is neither.
morally right, justiﬁable, nor
necessary. I am not convinced
that this conﬂict willbe a guar-
antee against future and dirtier
wars and that the blood which
has saturated that Asian soil w’a_s.
or is a price which must be paid.

Another Day I '
5 Beamon, Miale Bow
Out With Wit, Style;

By Tom Sacks
Sports Editor

7‘ I Fair is foul _and foul is fair_ Concerning the weather,
pave Hart might not feel that way but plenty of his foot-
ball players must. _

L -. I-Hart had hoped to -get Spring football drills underway
last week. On that time schedule, the Panthers would have
had 36 days in which to complete the 20 sessions allowed by
the NCAA. Right now, he is still waiting to start,

While Hart and 68 Panthers are watch-
ing the weather with their Varied interests,
there are two boys for whom the weather
is not more thaniia passing topic of interest.

They are Andy Beamon and Dick Miale.
Both will be seniors next year. For both ‘foot-
ball has been a part of their lives for many
years, Now it is all in the past.

Beamon and Miale have been put out to
 pasture as far_ as football is concerned. K
Andy because of the three concusions he suffered last year
and Birdeye because of a jammed knee.

Their absence will be a deﬁnite loss for the Panthers.
Notgonly in ter‘i"ns of the guts and determination they add-
ed on the ﬁeld, but also in terms of their color andwarmth
off the /ﬁeld. ' ‘

\

It’s hard to forget that night after the CUCL-A game

and shock waiting to return to their hotel in Santa Monica;
Looking around the darkened bus, Birdeye mumbled, “This
‘ ‘the greatest fraternity at Pitt. I- wouldn’t trade anything
or it.” , i -

And as the long season progressed they kept their

sense of humor, If it hadn’t been for that, the team might
have lost its sanity.

1;; _There’s Beamon sitting in a nearly deserted Towers
lobby -during the summer trimester. People are drifting
through headed for that afternoon’s Pirate game and Bea-
mon is chanting, “We’ve got the feeVah.”

~  One passing group yelled, “Come on and join us.”

 ‘Beamon replied, “I wish I could.” Then he mumbled,
«‘-‘But not with you.”

,-3;’ I; For good-natured people, everyone is second to Miale.
.5‘: Referring to Notre Dame, he pointed to the pillars in
the Towers lobby and said, “For practice we’re going to-

 these greeneand make believe-they’re the Irish- I
hear they are bigger than ever this year,” i

 A Both have garnered‘ eno_1_1gh C. stories fromfootball to

Cubs’ Past  
Gives Hope

or Future

by MIKE BROURMAN
For the freshman basket-
ketball team the battle has
ended but the war is just be-
ginning. Behind them is a
14-4 record, one of the most
successful in history. But still on
the road ahead is the task of
trying to ‘rescue basketball here

from its present sorry state.

This fall, frosﬁ coach Tim Grgu-
rich broughtlin the biggest group
of freshman. cagers in Pitt his-
tory, in size if not in numbers.
Limited to four scholarships,_ he_
cornered two members of state

- championship outﬁts, Mike Patch-

er, and Rob McFarland.

Along‘ with them came Bob
Petrini of highly rated De Matha
Catholic in Washington, D. C.,
and Charlie.Hunt, who at 6’7”, is
“just about the biggest kid we've
ever had here.” ‘

Assisted by _non- scholarship.
players Dick H-assin.ger,~ Bob
Brickner and Rick, Waggoner and
footballer Paul Naponick, they
compiled the 14 victories, most
ever for a frosh team .here, in-
cluding wins over arch-rival Du-
quesne and Wesley Junior Col-
lege, top ranked in the East.

These victories were the high-
lights of the season, and the Du-
quesne win, late in the season
was, according to Grgurich, “The
ﬁrst time we put everything to-
gether.” But there were disap-
pointments also. _

Chief among them were the.
two close losses to West Virginia.
and the early season trouncing
by Duquesne.

It was a year of learning also.
Petrini and Hassinger were con-
verted forwards playing guard
and they learned the hard way,
being pressed by nearly every
team they faced. But by the end
of the year the press proved in-
effective, and in the ﬁnal game
against Point Park Petrini played

s“his ﬁnest-ﬂoor game,” according

to assistant coach Carl Peterson.

How much the frosh have,learn-
ed will show up next year. It is
conceivable’ that they ‘could ﬁll
as many as three positions on the
starting varsity ﬁve.

Petrini could ﬁt in as a start-
ing guard while McFarland and
Patcher should be in the running
at a forward spot and Hunt is the
leading candidate for Jim LaVal-
l-ey’s spot at center. s

The frosh will have. a toughs

‘road, ahead, but as: Grgurich said

Lehigh, PSU

Try Rematch
    At Palestra

by ROY JACOBS
The Palestra is the Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania’s
barnlike excuse for a field-
house, and in recent years it
has gained’ national notori-

ety because of the loud, in-
timidating fans which come to
watch Philadelphia collegiate
basketball.

, The scenery changes somewhat
today and tomorrow as the Pales-
tra hosts the Eastern wrestling
championships. But _don’t bet the
fans won’t be just as loud and
intimidating.

“It’l1 be the biggest crowd ever
for the Easterns,” predicted varsi-
ty coach Dave Johnson. “They’re
sold out Friday and Saturday
nights—all 9,500 reserve seats.
Half of Lehigh’ll -be there.”. ,

Lehigh fans ought to feel right
at home because they’re‘used -to
badgering visiting teams in their
miniature Palestra called the Pit.
They’ll be out in force because
Lehigh stands a good chance of

_ defending last year’s title and

grabbing its 19th team title.
They’ll also want to see the Eu-
gineers avenge last weekend’s
18-12 dual meet loss to Penn
State.

“Lehigh has three guys who’ll
win—Caruso, Peritore, and Rush-
atz—and a couple guys who can
place,” said Johnson. “Penn State
has Fitz at 137 who’ll win and
maybe’ Reid at heavyweight. Lor-
enzo at 177 has a chance;’’

“The difference is, Lehigh has

some guys you know who’l def-
initely win.’’ ’ ‘

Johnson was not nearly as con-
ﬁdent about his own team’s out-
look, and one of the reasons is
the absence of Ron Schuchert
from the lineup. Schuchert sprain-
ed his ankle earlier this season,
and after running four miles the
d-ay before the Syracusemeet, he
suffered an attack of f/endonitis

so he wrestled, but the next day
he couldn’t walk. Now Schuchi
sert’s on crutches. ’

“He and Shildt were about the
only ones who had a chance of
placing,” said Johnson regretful-
ly. “Schuchert was in a good posi-
tion at 1374with Peritore moving
down.” .

Shildt will be wrestling at 123
where his toughest competition
will come from Lehigh’s Mike Ca-
ruso, two-time NCAA champion
at that weight, and Gary Burger
of Navy,» EIWA runner-up last
year. Burger defeated Shildt ear-
lier this year. '

Johnson tried to seem a little
optimistic. “I was pleasantly sur-
prised last year in the Easterns.
I just hope we can score a few
points.”

The best bet for a surprise lies
in Terry Hoover, who has moved
down to 17-7. His main competi-
tion there will come from Army’s
Jim Harter, runner-up last year;
Penn State’s Rich Lorenzo; and
Lehigh’s Joe Caprio.

“Terry has an outside chance,”
Johnson ﬁgured. “It depends up-
on how he goes in there to
wrestle. If he’s ready, he could
place.”

Last year the matmen only
managed two seconds and a third.

Only One Major Loss

Young Record Setters Give

Hope for Trackster Future
' by DAN LICHENSTEIN ‘

This seems to be the year for the promise of youth in
sports. The football and basketball teams base a great deal
of hope on the success of this year’s freshmen and sopho-
mores. Dave Hart’s recruiting program and -one of the best
freshman basketball teams ever are counted on to give vars-

have a monopoly on youth,
The track team has just ﬁnish-
ed as bad a year as the status

I sports. And although the runners’
- main problem, lack of depth, can

not be solved in only one or two

years, their underclassmen give

just as much hope for better
times to come.

Simple statistics tell the story.
In the four dual meets which
were lost to Kent State, Penn
State, Army and Navy, the sopho-
more and junior runners ‘out-
scored the seniors 58-13. ‘Five of.
the eight runners on the relay
teams were underclassmen.

Even more impressive is. the
number of records tied or broken.

Handelman will be a deﬁnite
loss to the team for his spirit and
leadership as well as for his ath-

Zink has shown the potential to .

more than make up for Handel-

meet that Handelman lowered
the varsity mile mark, Zink chop-

Competing against Grove
City College is one thing but

Don Schollander of Olympic
fame is quite another mat-
ter. And he is just a taste of
what the ﬁve chosen members of
the swimming. team will face in
the Easterns this Week at Yale
University.

The ﬁve representatives of the
varsity will compete in 10 or 11
individual events and the 400-
yard medley relay.

The varsity’s outstanding per-
former, John Lane, will lead the
squad to the New Haven cam-
pus. Lane has accumulated more
points this year than any other
member of the team with a total
of 79.75 points. He has racked
up 11 ﬁrst and seven seconds
while competing, in a number of
different events.

Lane’s best performance of the
year were against Miami of Ohio
and Syracuse, the ﬁrst two meets
of the season. He came in ﬁrst
in ﬁve out of the ﬁve events he
entered. Since these meets coach
Jerry Snyder has “stuck” Lane

in a. variety of -events to balance

_ the team's attack. If it wasn’t for

this switching, Lane’s point total
would be even higher.

In the Easterns, Lane will com-
pete in the 1,650-yard freestyle
and the 500-yard freestyle. If he
feels up to it, he will also be
entered in the 200-yard freestyle.

Howie Norris, the second lead,-
ing scorer on the varsity with
61.75 points, will be entered in
the 100 and 200-yard butterﬂy
events. In the past season, Nor-
ris ran a string of eight consecu-
tive wins in the 200-yard butter-
ﬂy, the longest of any member on
the squad.

Joe LeViere, the teams best
backstroker, will be entered in
both the 100 and 200-yard back-
stroke events. This past season
