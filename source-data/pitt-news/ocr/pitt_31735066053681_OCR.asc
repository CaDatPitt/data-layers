Minority scholarships wake the college dream of Pitt 0

Lisa Grzyboski
Senior Staff Writer

Ten Afn'can—American freshmen, who
were awarded full scholarships by Pitt's
University Challenge for Excellence
Programs, received formal recognition
yesterday for their high academic achieve-
ment, leadership, and community service
throughout their high-school years.

For the first time in UCEP history,
recipients of the Faison, Henderson and
Lavalle Scholarships came from all over
the continental U.S. —- hailing from such

' states as California, Indiana and Arkansas.

Many of these students received noti-
ﬁcation of their scholarship award along-
side their admittance to Pitt.

They were assessed by the UCEP
scholarship committee on their academic

performance, school and community
involvement, and service achievements as
described in their applications to Pitt.

''I didn't have to do a separate applica-
tion, so I basically found out about the
award when I found out I was accepted,"
Lavelle Scholarship recipient Joycelyn
Newsome said. "I was really happy. If it
wasn't for this scholarship, I would have
been going to a local community college."

I

, Newsome was the only recipient of
the Lavelle Scholarship, which awards
, African-American students entering Pitt's
Katz School of Business full tuition, room
and board for four years.
Two students admitted into the School
of Engineering received the Henderson
Scholarship, named after one—tirne Pitt

Staff Wrlter

Jeffrey Lawrence says he has a
two—part mission at Pitt: to teach and
to research.

And the research part just got a
lot easier.

Lawrence, an assistant professor
of biology, was recently awarded the
1997 Packard Fellowship for
Science and Engineering. The fel-
lowship provides $100,000 per year
for ﬁve years.

The money can be used for any
reasonable expenditure to aid in his
research on molecular evolution.
This includes purchasing equipment
and supplies, or for hiring graduate
student support.

" [Wn1r1ing the fellowship] was a

bit of a relief. It takes a bit of the pres-
sure off since every researcher
requires external research to do their
work," said Lawrence. "It helps get
the project olf the ground."

Letters went out earlier this year
to invite nominations for the award
to University heads across the nation,
including Chancellor Mark
Nordenberg. Susan Packard Orr —
the president of the David and Lucile
Packard Foundation —— wrote in the
letter that "The goals of the fellow-
ship program are to support out-
standing young faculty as they build
productive research programs and to
help attract and retain faculty of the
highest quality for our universities."

Lawrence said he was excited to
be the recipient of one of the grants

this year, an honor that is extended to
only 20 individuals.

"The competition is not just
biologists. Nominations come from
a variety of science and engineering
areas, and since [David] Packard
helped start Hewlett-Packard [com-
puter company],’I expected them to
be strongly focused on the engineer-
ing, so I was reasonably surprised to
learn that I'd been selected,"
Lawrence said.

One hundred faculty members
in the early years of their careers get
nominated from 50 universities
across the nation. The Packard
Foundation looks for young, creative
researchers in the ﬁelds of physics,
chemistry, math, biology, astrono-
my,computer science, earth science

ssoox fellowshipwill furtherbiologyresearch

and all branches of engineering.

Packard Foundation's scientiﬁc
advisory committee chooses the
recipients after a nomination from
the candidates‘ universities.

Lawrence, 33, has taught at Pitt
for one year and greatly appreciates
the grant for two chief reasons: it will
help him with his research and it will
help him to teach.

Because of the grant, more
undergraduates will be able to take
part in his research. Lawrence said
this will give him the opportunity to
bring more students into the labora-
tory and, in turn, bring a more hands-
on learning technique to his classes.

"Inclusion of undergraduates in
the lab will help me to accomplish
my mission at Pitt," said Lawrence.

PA legislature iclamps the
brakes on deadbeat parents

Across the Nation

LOWELL, Mass — Police
have arrested the ex—husband of a
woman who was shot to death on
Tuesday morning in front of her
three children at a school bus stop
in Massachusetts.

They are holding Richard
Kenny in suspicion of murder.

Police say Annie Glenn was
walking her three young children to
the bus stop in Lowell when a man
pulled up in a car, argued with her
and then fired several shots.
Several other children also wit-
nessed the shooting.

Glenn and the three children
had spent the night in a family
homeless shelter — but it's not
known if the family was ‘homeless,
or if Glenn and the children had

' gone there to get away from Kenny.

HARRISBURG, Pa — Anyone
who owes three or more months of
child support and refuses to make
payment could lose his driver's
license and vehicle registration
under a measure the Pennsylvania
House of Representatives passed
today.

The House voted 193-7 in favor
of an amendment to help the state
collect delinquent child support
payments. ,

More than $1 billion is owed in
Pennsylvania in delinquent child
support by more than 100,000 peo-
ple.

The measure, proposed by rep-
resentative Connie Williams, is
based on a Maine law that helped
that state collect $31 million.
Thirty-two states have passed dri-
ver's license or vehicle registration
revocation laws.

Pennsylvania must also pass a
driver's license revocation law, or it
could lose federal child support-
collection funding.

The amendment was tacked on
to a bill that would revoke firearms
licenses from those who were
served with protection from abuse
orders.

The bill, which passed 200-0,
now goes to the Senate for consid-
eration.

CAPE MAY, N.J. — Two
brothers from Philadelphia have
pleaded guilty to beating to death a

former sailor they claim ‘was look-
ing at their girlfriends in a New

Jersey bar.
Ninetee-n-year-old Adam Short
and his 21-year-old brother

Christopher entered their pleas to
manslaughter charges on Monday.

They were charged with the
February beating death of 23-year-
old John Vollrath Jr. of North
Wildwood.

A third man pleaded guilty to
manslaughter on Oct. 7. Joseph
Mader II, of North Cape May,
admitted he held Vollrath's arms
while the two men beat him outside
Club Kaladu in Wildwood.

All three face recommended
seven—year prison sentences.
According to state guidelines, they
would be eligible for parole in 2.5
years.

The three remain free on bail
until the Jan. 2 sentencing.

Around the World

CASTRIES, Saint Lucia — An
American injured when a boat full
of scuba divers exploded in Saint
Lucia has died. Questions have
arisen about whether the blast was
an accident.

It was at least the third explo-
sion of a boat in Saint Lucia in the
past 13 months. There have been
other ‘acts of sabotage that one
yachting newspaper suggests might
involve a turf-war for tourism.

A Swiss woman and two diving
instructors also died in Sunday's
blast.

American Paul George of Long
Island was evacuated to Jackson
Memorial Hospital in Miami, where
he died of his injtiries Monday
night. _
Three tourists from Britain, one
from Germany, and two others were
flown to hospitals on the French
island of Martinique and in the
United States.

One victim, Victoria Simpson,
is in stable condition at the hospital
of the University of Pennsylvania in
Philadelphia. 0

There has been no comment
from the Saint Lucia government or
police, who are investigating the
explosion.

SCHOLARSHIPS

Provost Donald Henderson. Seven Faison
Scholarships were awarded to students
entering the College of Arts and Sciences.

Dr. Chentis Pettigrew, UCEP director
and assistant CAS dean, said the names for
the scholarships were chosen because
Faison, Henderson and Lavelle were
"African—American leaders who have
made great contributions to the
University." V

"Both Faison and Lavelle were picked
because they are alums who are active
within the University and the community.
Henderson's primary focus while provost
was providing institutional access, opening
the University to a more diverse group of
people."

The newly—implemented Helen
Faison Scholarship was first awarded in
1993 to incoming freshman undergradu-
ates, and the other two academic awards
quickly followed suit. Since their incep-
tion, leaders across campus have noticed a
marked improvement in the superiority
and number of African-Americans apply-
ing to Pitt.

"These scholarships are a response to

society," Pettigrew said. "They are focused
on developing student potential, and they
are attracting some of the most talented
African—American students to Pitt."

This is central to UCEP’s mission of
increasing the admission, retention, and
graduation of Pitt minority students.

All the 1997-98 scholarship recipients
graduated in the top 5 percent of their
class, with some having a grade-point
average above 4.0, UCEP Assistant
Director Gail Austin said.

“These students are very high—acl1iev-
ing students academically, and they also
have a service record as well. They are
equivalent to the Chancellor’s Scholars,”
she said, referring to the full four-year aca-
demic scholarships awarded to students by
the University Honors College. This is
something that Pitt administrative ofﬁcials
want to see more of in the coming years.

‘The provost ofﬁce has a goal to make
Pitt a national leader in terms of providing
educational access and a diversified stu-
dent body,” Vice Provost for Academic
Affairs Jack Daniel said. ‘The Faison,
Lavelle and Henderson scholars are central

“The major goal of Robert Lavelle, after

quality of the freshman

with all forms of radiation," he said.
His parents had an ultraviolet lab
in the house and many books on sci-
ence and medicine, both of which
helped to cultivate his interest in
"understanding the nature of radiation
and the nature of particles that make up

‘ the universe."

When Sternglass begins talking
about physics, his 74-year-old frame
jumps to life, animated by his eager-
ness to explain abstract principles.

His eyes grow bright and he sits
taller as he spins the tale of how the
universe was born. And somehow, he
transfers his enthusiasm to the people
he is talking with, even if they have
proclaimed themselves hopelessly lost

in science. V

Sternglass explains the abstract
ideas in quick metaphors, a characteris-
tic inspired by the philosophies of
Descartes.

"He believed we should be able to
find analogies on every scale," he said,
"and that we ought‘ to be able to under-
stand fundamental particles as well as
larger objects." '

Sternglass said that he thought a
photon might look like a smoke ring.

. And he compared an _evolving
galaxy to a human embryo.

"The arms [of a galaxy] develop
later, like a little embryo," he said.
"You know you start out as a tiny ovum
and then you form all the different

organs and eventually you get arms and
legs coming out. And that's exactly
how galaxies seem to be developing."

Sternglass asserts that the universe
is designed to be figured out.

"It looks as if the universe was cre-
ated in such a matter as to allow con-
sciousness to arise and living beings to
come into being that could understand
the nature and laws of physics,- see the
beauty of the universe and admire a
creator for creating it," he said. "You
see because every artist, no matter how
great he be, wants to bepappreciated for
the beauty he creates. That's why peo-
ple sign a painting."

Sternglass believes, like Albert
Einstein did, that there is a spirit that
somehow designed the laws of the uni-
verse.

Einstein and Sternglass had a

unique relationship. The two met in the
spring of 1947 when Sternglass was
invited to Einstein's apartment to dis-
cuss physics. They spoke for five hours

 ..which surprised Sternglass.

"I was amazed because a couple of
times his secretary came in and told
him he had another appointment or
something like that. But he said to me,
'You wait here, I'll be right back.’ I was
just a young student," said Sternglass.
"I'd just‘ begun grad school at George
Washington."

They corresponded by mail for a
number of years after their chat.
Sternglass sometimes sent Einstein the
papers he published and Einstein often
responded.

Einstein advised Sternglass in
many ways. He reminisced about a few
specific pieces of Einstein's advice.

"He told me to ‘always have a cob-
bler's job and do all your research in
your spare time."' ,_

Einstein scrawled "Be Stubborn"
across the back of a printed card to
"Sternglass. Because they normally
spoke in their native German, since it
was easier for Einstein, Sternglass
interprets the advice to read, "Be per-
sistent."

"It's very easy to give up under
pressure," said Sternglass. "That's what
Einstein warned me about. He said, ‘If
you go back to graduate school, they'll
try to crush every original idea out of
yOu.III ‘

But Sternglass went to grad school
anyway. He says he felt that he had to
get a higher degree to get the kind of
job he wanted. He did, however, keep
his guard up, not letting his ideas and
creativity become stiﬂed.

His Cornell University degrees, a
B.E.E., Electrical Engineering (1944),
a MS, Engineering Physics (1950),
and a Ph.D., Engineering Physics, got
him jobs at such places as
Westinghouse Research Laboratories,
Cornell, George Washington, Indiana
and Pittsburgh Universities.

He says he has always made the
time for his own research on the nature
of the universe and his study of —— and
later protest against —— nuclear energy
and radiation.

Sternglass, who retired 12 years
ago, said, "I'm having a lot of fun
thinking about all of these things. And
I have my hands full with all this work
with the environmental effects of radi-
ation. This has been a really satisfying
retirement for me.

"My retirement gave me a chance
to do what I really want to do
[research]," he said. "The rest was just
long enough to do something useful,
earn a living, put the kids through col-
lege, and prepare for the interesting
things that were lying ahead."

Biotechnology gives
usmore control   

The ﬁrst successful birth with frozen human eggs in this
country was reported last week. For several years, scientists
have been able to freeze human sperm and fertilized embryos,
but unfertilized eggs have posed a problem until now.

Now it is possible for a‘ young woman to have her eggs ,

frozen —— for a presumably large sum of money — until a later
time when she is ready to have children.

This means menopause, while still a physiological reality,
will no longer be a barrier for older women trying to have chil-
dren, as long as they plan several years in advance. This can
also help women who, like the one in last week’s reported suc-
cess, undergo premature menopause and no longer have any

eggs of their own by the time they are ready to have children. '

It also means that women can protect their eggs ﬁom cer-
tain dangerous medical treatments. For example:
Chemotherapy can damage the ovaries, but if a woman with
cancer has some of her eggs removed and frozen before
undergoing such therapy, she can protect them and still bear
children after the treatment has ended. -

Furthermore, the ability to implant a woman with one of

' her own eggs will help avoid the confusion over parental iden-

tity that can result from using a donor’s embryos.
It will be possible to build egg banks, like sperm banks, so

_ that infertile women will be able to bear children.

This is likely going to be a very expensive procedure for
a long time. You can bet that, for a while, only women who

qualify as good test candidates for scientiﬁc studies will be ’

able to do this, since it will probably be scientiﬁc interest pay-
ing the bills. In a few years, career women will be the only
ones able to afford having a few of their eggs frozen for future
use. ~
Essentially, what this new development, and what many
of the developments in biotechnology of the past several years
mean, is that women can now have more control over their
reproductive choices. Many of the complications that result
from random genetic or environmental causes can now be
avoided, and many women can have families who otherwise
might not.
And this is what technology is really supposed to do for
us, anyway -—— to give us better control over our lives.
Let’s just hope that such technologies become available to
more than just the rich, and that politicians don’t try to take our
control away.

Attomey General Janet Reno wants-

to ﬁne the Microsoft Corporation an out-
rageous $1 million per day. She and cm-
ers on the anti—Bi1l Gates march argue
that Microsoft holds an unfair monopoly
on conrputer software.

Its monopoly lies in that fact that
roughly 85 percent of desktop computers
in the world run Microsoft’s highly suc-
cessful Windows operating system.
Microsoft has asked vendors who pack-
age Wmdows with their computers to
also include Microsoft’s intemet browser
software —— Internet Explorer. Since
Windows is the most versatile operating
system available for PCs, opponents
argue that it is too easy for Microsoft to
ﬂood the market with its browser, unfair-
ly taking sales away ﬁorn competitors.

It is certainly true that the Windows
operating system gives Microsoft a huge
advantage over other software vendors.
But is the advantage unfair? Absolutely
not. Microsoft still has to compete on a
technical level, to make sure that its
browser is the best available. Otherwise,
itistooeasyforuserstodownloadtlieir

Nobody has ever « criticized
Microsoft for including the free word
processors Notebook, Write and
Wordpad with Windows, nor for the free
graphics software Paint and Paintbrush.
Why? Because those programs are very
weak and are not suited for very demand-
ing applications.

Nobody has criticized the computer-
prograrnrriing gurus on the intemet who
banded together under the leadership of
Linus Torvalds. to create Linux — an
entire operating system plus applications
— for making it absolutely free to any-
body with interriet access.

As long as Microsoft’s programmers
can continue to provide powerful appli-
cations that computer users want, the
corripany is not playing unfairly at all. If
Microsoft can provide a product that is
better and cheaper, well, let’s not curse it
for being fair capitalists.

Reno has rriade a huge statement
with her request that Microsoft be ﬁned
$1 rriillion per day, especially considering
that federal law prohibits industrial cor-
porations ﬁorri being ﬁned more than
$25,000 per day for dumping toxic waste.

  
   

THE PITT NEWS

It makes you wonder what our govem-
ment’s priorities really are.

. Many people in recent years have
brought up discussion about reforrriing
the American legal system. The most
common argument —-juries are too easi-
ly brainwashed by the media and cannot

make fair judgments involving public ﬁg- ’

ures — came out of the ﬁrst O.J. Sirripson
verdict

Right now, the second Oklahoma
City borribirig trial is providing us with
more reason to doubt our system, and the
trial hasn’t even begun.

Just past the halfway rriark in jury
selection for the trial, prosecution lawyers
have requested that ﬁve jurors be
removed. These included a seventh- grade
teacher who said she could never give
somebody the death penalty, not even to
someone who had committed war
crimes, and an elderly former inrriate
from Long Island who said, “No one
should take another’s life, other than
God”

Everyone has a right to their own
belief systems and morals, but if these get
in the way of justice, these persons have
to be removed from the jury. Our system
provides for that. ’ ,

Our system does not provide for the
possibility that people will change their
minds once selected. It doesn’t ackriowl—
edge that somebody who thought he held
a very hard—line attitude toward criminals
might ﬁnd himself unable to give a guilty
verdict when he ﬁnds he carmot be per-
sonally responsible for another’s death.

. Juries are speciﬁcally chosen for
their ignorance and their stupidity. But
they are not chosen for their ability to be

"rational, to separate a judgment ﬁom

knowledge of the consequences.

An effective legal system has to pro-
vide consequences that ﬁt the crime, n‘ot
consequences that ﬁt the jury. If a citizen
has diﬁiculty with the laws, he should be
able to address that concern to our legis-
lators, but this should not get in the way

of legal due process.

urrent SGB members don’t seem to want to go out peacefully

Zachariah Blott

News Editor
SGB candidates Damon Hudac and Joe
Gielata, the Gargoyle Party, appeared atop
the roof of a walkway just outside the Fifth
Avenue side of the Union this past Monday
at noon. They told the students below that

r they wanted the upcoming SGB campaign

to be about the issues: communication
between students and leaders, reform within
the allocations process, and getting graduat-
ing classes of the future to donate gargoyles
to the Cathedral of Learning.

As I was sitting on a bench covering the
event for this paper, I spotted three members
of the current SGB —— Marquette Bowman,
Christa Douaihy and Dave Eisenberg —
standing near the entrance to the Union and
watching what was happening.

Deciding a picture of the trio giirnacing
at the Gargoyle Party’s words wouldn’t be a
bad thing to have, I turned my camera
toward them. They spotted me doing so and
reacted immediately: Eisenberg gave me a
big shit-eating grin and an exaggerated
wave, and Douaihy decided to give me two
middle ﬁngers. .

All three knew I was an editor for The
Pitt News and decided this was the most suit-
able way to act towards the media. Good for
them, giving me canned photos of their
toothy grins and ﬂicking me oil“. Douaihy
called her actions “a joke aimed at you guys
[The Pitt News].”

Imagine Bill Clinton giving a
Washington Post or USA Today reporter the
middle ﬁnger as a joke. I guess he wouldn’t
do that if he wanted to maintain the media’s
respect, or the public’s.

or “jokers.”

These two “jokers”
have been to every SGB meeting since last
September and know what’s, going on in stu-
dent government better than any student on
campus, other than perhaps SGB members
themselves and a few of our reporters.

These two “jokers” have both won aca-
demic scholarships to Pitt, and Gielata has
even won a Chancellor scholarship. Hudac
was selected as a ResCon computer advisor
for the dormitories this year.

And how respectable is the organization
they are bringing down by “mocking” it?

First of all, Douaihy thinks the universal

. D°”M-RY

He wrapped it up very
nicely by saying little
more than that the pair wanted to take stu-
dent money to pay for gargoyles.

Considering that Hudac and Gielata
explained very clearly they only wanted the
funds that would normally go to the graduat-
ing class’ gift to the University to be used on
the gargoyles, I would feel guilty not telling
Eisenberg to have his hearing checked, espe-
cially as he seems to have rriissed most of
what the two said about their campaign.

But I’m sure the SGB has acted nobly
on other occasions that would warrant their
being a respectable organization that these

two candidates were mocking unjustiﬁably.

Take last weekend for example. I had
tliegoodfoitunetobeinSqi1irrelHillata
fiiend’s apartment on Friday evening when
SGB rriember Brian Riemer showed up to
chat with my fiiend’s roomrriate. For the
next 20 minutes, I heard Riemer yelling as
loudly as he could that he wanted “50 people
on the phone next week sucking my ass or
I’ll cut your budget from $1,600 to $2 .”

I was ﬁlled in later that Riemer and my
friend’s roommate were in the same honor

society and Riemer didn’t feel that the mem— L

bers of the society were paying him enough
attention, so he decided to threaten a meni-
ber of the group by suggesting he’1l cut the
amount of money the organization receives
from the Allocations Committee, which
SGB oversees.

Judging from their past spending habits,
I’m sure the SGB will know what to do with
the extra money. 0

But Riemer made the whole thing crys-
tal clear on Tuesday by saying he won’t cut
their budget, and had made the remarks
because he was speaking out of “anger about
an event that occurred in an organization I
am part of.”

So again I have to consider whether the
Gargoyle Party was mocking the SGB.
letting the Pitt community know how they
feel about campus issues, without trying to
sabotage anyone’s campaign, may very well
be a mockery of the job our elected “leaders”
have done.

Zachariah Blott wants to ask Christa
Douaihy if two middle ﬁngers are better than
one? i

 

Men of Teal  
bring new look
to Fall Classic

As the autumn.leaves begin to fall to
the ground, yielding the harsh reality that

winter is just around the comer, one vestige

of summer remains: postseason baseball.
The World Series has been a symbol of

stability for Americans since its inception in

1902. The Fall Classic, as it is aptly nick-

-named, traditionally pits the two ﬁnest

teams from the National League and the
American League in a seVen—game struggle.

But this isn’t the same old World
Series. C

The 1997 classic is breaking the tradi-
tional mold of the World Series and in the
process, giving fans a taste -of the future.
One team in particular, the Florida Marlins,
has become the symbol of the new series.

The Marlins, still in their embryonic

stage, have made the gigantic leap to the
World Series in just their ﬁfth year of exis-
tence. Before entering the league in 1993,
the entire state of Florida had never hosted a
professional game (save for the meaningless
Grapefruit League games in February and
March), let alone a World Series game in
October.
9 After the ﬁrst game of the Series, one
Marlin fan was overheard saying, “We wait-
ed ﬁve years for this, but the wait was worth
1t.” '

Five years? That’s not a wait; it’s a brief
pause. Maybe Marlin fans forget that their
opponents, the Cleveland Indians, waited
41 years before they made the World Series
in 1995. Now that’s a wait.

But it’s not like the ﬁrst two games
even had the feel of traditional World Series
contests. Yes the games were competitive,
but the balmy Miami weather was hardly
what you would expect for a World Series

g game in rnid-October. Game Two tipped the

thermostat at nearly '80 degrees. In case you
don’t know, that’s roughly 40 degrees
warmer than we traditionally see in the
Northeast.

The Marlins’ stadium, “Pro Player
Stadium,” is also far different than the
quaint “ball yard” that is most associated
with traditional World Series sites. Rather,
Pro Player Stadium is a massive, multipur-
pose, 65,000—capacity entertainment com-

plex. Could you ’ imagine corporate sky

boxes in Ebbets Field?
Even the Marlins’ colors, teal and

~ black, are products of l990’s sports fash-

ions. Gone are the days of traditional uni-
forms conjured up with phrases such as
“Dodger blue” or “Yankee pinstripe.” No,
the Marlins, with their three-hat rotation and

Commitment and responsibility are two
prime components in what has made him

successful.

“No matter what you’re doing on the

or responsibility, whether it be to your
teammates, your coaches or your team,”
Kasperowicz said. “That also carries over
to the classroom and regular life. The
responsibility is most important with hav-
ing to be at meetings and classes at certain
times.”

The Pittsburgh Lady

The roster is filled with 22
freshmen and 11 sophomores

talent that has been thrown to

of the Big East conference this

In this pack of young
players, there are many
promising forwards, defense-

they are all led by one stand-

weekend during the season,
McClure would travel two
hours to play and to gain more
experience before she moved
off to college.

Because of her huge
amount of success in high
school, McClure drew much
attention from colleges and
universities all across the
country. McClure was _inter-
ested in a change from the
rural small town to the big
city.

atmosphere of the city and I

younger Kasperowicz led North Hills High
School to an undefeated season, as it gar-
nered l5 wins on the way to the 1994 PIAA
Quad-A championship.

The state championship capped oﬂ’
Kasperowicz’s stellar high-school carn-
paign. He brought numerous accolades to
Pitt, including the esteemed titles of Parade
Magazine’s All—American, the Associated
Press Pennsylvania Player of the Year and
the Dapper Dan Quad-A Player of the Year.
Kasperowicz also was recruited by schools
such as Michigan, Georgia Tech, Penn State
and Syracuse before comrriitting to Pitt.

Things took a U-tum when
Kasperowicz arrived in Oakland in the fall
of 1994. Early in camp he was switched to
the defensive secondary after taking a cou-
ple of snaps at quarterback.

“When I first came here I had a shot [at
playing quarterback] for the first couple
days, then we had some injuries on
defense,” he said. “The coaches thought I
could step in on defense and play right
away, which I did as a freshman. Then it
sort of just snowballed after that. I was
doing well, and rather than trying to take a
couple steps back and try to prepare for the
quarterback role again, the coaches told me,
‘We want you to stay there.”’

And he’s thrived on the defensive side
of the ﬁeld. In 1994, Kasperowicz earned
his first Pitt letter, playing 10 games on spe-
cial teams and as a nickel back. In 1995, he
earned his second Pitt letter, playing 11
games as a reserve defensive back and as a
regular special-teams player.

Despite not getting his licks in at quar-
terback, Kasperowicz still ﬁnds a way to
contribute to the Panthers.

“It’s a welcome thing to have a guy
who’s a smart football player like he is,
who’s won a lot of games, and as a football
player to come back and make a contribu-
tion,” says Head Coach Walt Harris. “He’s
done a nice job this season so far, had a nice
interception against  and he’s a
smart football player. He’s not a real physi-
cal player, but he’s getting things done for
us, so we’re really excited about his pro-
ductivity.”

Roommate Varoutsos reiterates the
intelligence and productivity of which
Harris spoke, and attributes Kasperowicz’s
success on defense to his enthusiasm for the
game. '

THE PITT NEWS 9

mom PAGE 8

“He’s been moved around a lot, but he
never really complains,” Varoutsos said.

' “He just wants to play football.
Wherever he’s at, he gives his 100 percent.
We talk about it all the time, the problems
he’s been through and it doesn’t really get to
him. He takes it all in stride. As long as he
plays, that’s all.”

One of the problerris Kasperowicz
faced in 1996 was the knee injury he sus-
tained in the 72-0 loss to Ohio State. It
ended his junior season prematurely. Insult
was added to the injury when the NCAA
powers that be denied him a medical red-
shirt because he suffered his injury during
the sixth game of the season, right as the
redshirt—eligibility period expired.

But instead of being hindered,
Kasperowicz focused his energies on reha-
bilitation, concentrated on his studies, and
looked forward to his senior season.

“It [the knee injury] hurt me a lot  I
was to have two more years left, with an
injury like that. But that was a big draw-
back. Once I came back, I had one year left.
It gave me that much more motivation to
work harder and to make sure I was back
much healthier for my senior season.” -

This season Kasperowicz is playing
and contributing to a stingy Panther defen-
sive.

“He’s playing at outside linebacker
now, and he’s done well,” says Harris. “I’m
glad that he’s found himself in the starting
lineup. He’s done some nice things for us.”
Case in point: intercepting a crucial Miami
pass midway through the third quarter to
thwart any hopes the Hurricanes had of
winning that ball game.

The desire to play at quarterback still
bums inside Kasperowicz. During spring
drills, he took snaps on a limited basis, but
the coaching staff decided to keep him on
defense —- a decision that depended greatly
on Kasperowicz’s tentative redshirt status.

Kasperowicz will be graduating in the
spring. But after his senior year, he will still
be on campus to complete his education-
program requirements. He hopes to return
to the North Hills School District to teach
physical education and possibly coach
high-school athletics, but for now the all-
American boy next door is savoring his
days of playing college football.

“It’s just been a great experience,” he
said. “I don’t regret it at all.”

The Marlins were built around the
dominant facet of sports in the ‘90s — free
agency. The Marlins have few homegrown
players. It’s the power of Wayne Huizenga’s
dollar, not excellent scouting, that has built
the Marlins. After all, when Bobby Bonilla
and Kevin Brown entered the league, there
wasn’t even a team called the Florida
Marlins.

FROM PAGE 8

al forward position to the midﬁelder posi-
tion.

As a midﬁelder she carries more
responsibilities, especially defensively.

“I have to be more defensive—rninded,

be able to track back a lot,” she said, “and ,

I have to be at the top of my ﬁ_tness level.
As a forward, I know I am a fast player
and I can always outrun another player. I
try to mark the sweeper.”

When the season began, McClure

'wasted little time in making herself

known. She scored her first goal in the
ﬁfth game of the year, against St. John’s,
by blasting a shot past a helpless Red
Storm goalkeeper on a breakaway.

“I was so bewildered on the one-on-
one break and after the goal,” she said,
adding that the goal wasn’t as important
because the Panthers lost the game, and
the team comes first.

McClure made two key assists in
upcoming games. Her ﬁrst came against
West Virginia, and helped the Lady
Panthers along to a 1-0 victory; it’s a game
that she says was one of the most impor-
tant games this season.

“The West Virginia game stands out
the most this season — as our ﬁrst win. It
got us over that hump.”

The other assist came against another
Big East foe, Providence, as the two teams
fought to a 1-1 tie.

She also does not hesitate to take a
shot when an opportunity is presented.
McClure has 13 shots on the season so far.

The freshman commented on the
team’s improvement throughout the sea-
son, saying, “Our losses were very close,
even though the score may not show it.
VV1th the passionate drive of Coach Sturk
and the young team, success is deﬁnitely
in the future.”

McClure also stressed the dominant

play of rookie goalkeeper Nicole Bashor
who has had a tremendous season so far in
net.

“Nicole has kept us in so many games
this season,” she said.

She commented that the team has
really learned to play with each other and
that they have improved dramatically
since the start of the season.

The team plays all of its Sunday home
games at Sewickley Academy, about 30
minutes north of the city. McClure cites
that long—distance trip as one of the more
difﬁcult parts of playing for Pitt.

“I personally prefer Pitt Stadium
because of the fan support, which is so
important, and we don’t get it as much at
Sewickley. ‘But I do prefer the grass ﬁeld
because it creates such a different style of
play.”

McC1ure’s soccer success seemingly
runs in the family. She has an older broth-
er, Brennan, who is a junior standout at
Vanderbilt University. She also has two
younger sisters, Erin and Kyler, who she‘
would love to have follow in her footsteps.
Erin is a sophomore soccer star at
Charity’s old high school. Charity would
love to have Erin come to play at Pitt.
