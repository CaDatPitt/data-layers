SGS Seat on council Argued 30 Board Approves

BY LISA RUBENSTEIN
Controversy surrounds the pro-
posed University Senate bylaw
amendment ’to increase Senate

a Council membership by one seat,

k- 

’. ‘--providing representation of Gen-
eral Studies (SGS) Students on"

Senate Council.

The approximately 7,000 SGS
students are not currently re-
presented on Senate Council.

At the Monday meeting, Senate

Council instructed the Organiza- «

tions and Procedures (O&P) Com-
mittee torprepare the amendment
to be presented to Council in
March.

Chairman of the O&P Committee
Professor Clifford Ham said, “The
Council and the O&P Committee
recognize the need for General

Studies representation, but we feel
' that the Senate is not going to pass’

the amendment.”

He said increasing student repre-
sentation could lead to requests-by
other groups for increased repre-
sentation, and in the face of
changing enrollments and shifting
trends, a bylaw change would be
unwarranted. -

“The Committee suggested in

1:\."§’anuary that the four seats. now

held by undergraduate day stu-
dents be re-allocated to include one
General Studies representative,”
Ham added. .

the re-allocation of seats, between

i-‘PPU cans for Action
on Insurance Inequities

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY
Chancellor Wesley W. Posvar’s
refusal to meet with representa-
tives of the Pitt Professional Union

(PPU) to renegotiate the student‘

health plan prompted a rally of

graduate teaching staff Wednesday

to discuss further tactics.
The request for the meeting was

made in a letter January 20, 1975

asking the Chancellor to _“desig-
nate responsible authorities to
meet immediately with a commit-
tee of graduate employees ap-
pointed by the PPU to renegotiate a
health insurance policy. that satis-
ﬁes graduate employees needs.”
The refusal to meet with PPU
representatives came in a letter
from assistant to the Chancellor
David Rowers citing the current
labor hearings between the Uni-
versity and six labor groups as
rendering PPU-Pitt administration

, talks illegal. , -

Chancellor’s office would meet
with student groups on the health

‘insurance question if requested.

Unrest among the graduate
teaching assistants, teaching. fel-
lows and graduate. assistants
hinges on the contents of the
current health plan, speciﬁcally the
inclusion of a $100 deductible
clause.

Under the current insurance plan,
a policy holder must pay the ﬁrst
$100 of major medical expenses for
his dependents, with an overall
$300 ceiling.

“The only notification (of the $100
deductible clause) was a sentence
in the insurance plan. We are
upset with the content of these
charges‘ and the way they were
made,” said Marc McCullough, a
PPU member and history teaching
fellow.

According to McCullough there
have been a number of incidents of
policy-holders ﬁling a claim, and
having it returned because they
were unaware of the changes in the
policy.

Larry Platt said he does not feel
that the room rates are “that bad,”
but is concerned with dorm main-
tenance—peeling paint and dirty
hallways and stairwells.

Chancellor Wesley Posvar was
also concerned’ with the quality of
life in the dorms. “If rates are
going up and student needs aren’t
being met, it’s time to get to-
gether,” Posvar said.

Dutton also said that major reno-
vations are being ‘done to Univer-
sity buildings, one at a time.
“We’re trying to do the worst areas
ﬁrst as far as the dollars will take
us,” he said.

In a discussion of the Undergrad-
uate Academic Review (UAR) Platt
said the UAR is not a valid way of

- evaluating the two goals it was set

up to achieve: a guide for students
in choosing courses and an evalua-
tionof teachers. Platt said it was
time to bring students and faculty
together to see if ‘these goals‘ are
mutually ‘exclusive. The Commit-

 

BY PETE BUTCH

The "Student Government (SG)
Board decided in Wednesday’s
meeting to provide a maximum of
$302 in ﬁnancial aid to students
attending .the National Student
Conference Against Racism today
in Boston. '

Of the _42 students planning to

‘ attend, 28 indicated they need aid.

The Board decision grants them a
maximum of $9 to each. The two
SG members attending will receive
a maximum of $25 which is full
support. The money will pay for
the round-trip bus fare to Boston.
A representative from the SG
Board and the Boston Committee
will decide how much aid‘ each
student will receive.

The Board also directed those_

  Na Dorm Servicecutbacki

tee will also seek information from
other colleges and universities who
have reviews. _ -
Posvar voiced concern about the
quality of life in Oakland. “This is
where students spend their time for
four years. There is a danger that
Oaklandjs about to tip over into
decline.” He said that there are
problems of physical safety on the
streets with local youth gangs from
other areas coming into Oakland.

Business ownership by speculators

who aren’t concerned with making
Oakland an attractive place to live
has also had adverse effects on
0akland’s environment, he said.
Platt suggested a
Landlords” day‘ where the Univer-
sity community would take the first
step toward better communication
with Oakland" business people.
Platt stressed that this. would not
be a confrontation situation focus-

ing on complaints but a chance for *

students to meet with landlords to
see what facilities they offer.

Council Slot Argued

(Continued from Page I)
undergraduate Student Govern-
ment (SG) Board were held in
January at the suggestion of the
O&P Committee.

SGS Cabinet student agent’ Debby
Hombake supported the proposed
-bylaw amendment explaining,
“We’re delighted the proposal for
SGS representation has gone this
far, we’ve'been trying for three
years. If the amendment is voted
down it will be on the question of
more students on Council.
conceivable the Senate may not
want more students on Council.”

“I don’t think there’s any conﬂict
between SGS and Student Gov-
ernment, however, if Council of-

fered us a seat, even one of the
daytime undergraduate seats, we
wouldn’t turn it down,” she said.
“But we want‘ to avoid stepping on
SG’s toes.”

SG Board member, Tyrone Hub-
bard advocated passage of the
proposed bylaw amendment ex-
plaining, “Members of General
Studies should get a'seat, but we
feel we should not lose an under-
graduate daytime seat.”

SG President Larry Platt added,
“The four undergraduates on
Council now, represent a wide
variety of interests—engineers,
blacks, women, greeks, and nur-
ses. We feel it is important that
these interests be represented.”

“If we were to keep the four seats
and give one to General Studies
undergraduates, then we would
have proportional representation, ’ ’
Platt added.

“I think the Council has already
made their decision and‘ we will
probably lose the seat,” said

Hubbard, “but if there’s any way »

we can contest it we will.”
The proposed bylaw amendment
will be presented at the March

It is’

meeting of the Senate Council for
examination. If the amendment
passes the first reading at the
Senate meeting on March 20, the
ﬁnal vote will be taken at the June
6 Senate meeting. Implementation
is expected by July, if the amend-
ment passes.

If the bylaw amendment does not
pass the University Senate, the

problem of institution of SGSw-- - ‘

representation will be returned to
the Senate Council.

PPU (Falls for
Action on
Insurance

(Continued from Page 1)
made an effort to publicize the
changes with advertisements in the
Pitt News and special mailings to
the graduate teaching staff.

“Retroactive action. (by the

University) is impossible because ,-n

—-<

of financial reasons and the fact we” 

have a contract with Blue Shield/
Blue Cross,” Steele said concern-
ing the present policy.

“They are perfectly welcome to
bring their complaints to the
committee presently studying the
new policy. It would be an unfair
labor practice to meet with the PPU
when there are several groups
petitioning _to represent the
faculty,” Steele added.

Alternative tactics to the meeting
with Posvar as described by
McCullough include informational
picket lines or work stoppages.

“People in this country did

1 collective bargaining before there

,were labor laws,” McCullough
said, “We’re going to have to fight
with collective bargaining if we

‘want to make some kind of

change.”

cannot be handled by a few

some people to go up and have a

LeBlanc also said the majority of
the people were sincere in going to
this conference and not just in it for
aid money.” It’s unfortunate to
penalize so many people for a few
who want to go just to have fun. I
don’t think we’re being taken
advantage of,” he said.

The Board unanimously rejected
the Allocations proposal. Alloca-
tions held an emergency meeting
and decided to submit the same
proposal again on the same
grounds. SGB rejected it 5-1.

Since Allocations had two pro-

jgosals rejected it was up to SGB to

. 7
}r\

decide how to fund the Boston
Committee. A proposal by SG
member Mary Schwarz to give ten
students half-funding was rejected
as was another by Board member
Mark Satinoff giving the Boston
Committee $550 to distribute to
needy students.

Craig Bluestein then proposed the
maximum $9 per student which’
was accepted 5-2. , _

In‘other business SG Board intro-
duced the idea of creating adminis-
trative assistants for Board mem-
bers. Each Board member would
choose his own administrative as-
sistant who would handle paper-
work and other tasks SG members
are too busy to handle.

SG President Larry Platt and Dan
Stiffler, who are investigating the
Housing increased, reported Vice
Chancellor of Business and Finance
Joseph Dutton has agreed to look
over cost sheets with them. Platt
and Stiffler maintain that a de-

,7/‘l"\,“c5.*.fease in service has occurred.
,k . .

Dutton informed _Platt and Stiffler
that if students were concerned
they should contact the“ Resident
Student Association. Platt and

Stifﬂer plan to go over-the Housing‘

Office statistics with Dutton.
Bruce Keeler, reporting -on the
Student Health Insurance situa-
tion, said due to rate increases
some insurance beneﬁts will have

   

:\ fl

to be decreased. A meeting to
decide which beneﬁts will go was
planned for this morning.

Voting on allocations bylaws and
the Committee on Student Organi-
zations recommendation to with-
draw recognition from 32 organiza-
tions was tabled until the next
meeting, as was budget modifica-
tions and emergency requests by
the Arnold Air Society, A Little
Help From Your Friends, and the
ROTC Cadette Brigade.

SGB accepted Allocations recom-
mendation to reject a budget
modification for the Public Interest
Research Group, and the rejection
of an emergency request by the Pitt
Ski Club. SGB also supported the
Allocations decision on the Pitt
Hockey Club, which is without
funds and owes $2,095 in league
dues. Allocations will match dollar

Club can raise. .

SGB rejected the Allocations dis-
approval of selling block seats at
the Greek Week concert. They also
sent back for rewriting an_ emer-
gency request by Some of God’s
Children.

The Board also approved Cathy
Green as the seventh Allocations

Committee member, Karen Ritchie ,

as the Freshman Fall Weekend
chairperson and Kevin Joyce as the
Legal Awareness chairperson.
TheBoard approved Jamie McIn-
tyre for the Parlimentarian Com-
mittee, Dave Mistick and Marti
Gronsky for the Admissions and
Aid Committee, Margie Schramm
for the Tenure _ and Academic
Freedom Committee, and Martin
Supowitz and Bruce Keeler for the
Budget Policies Committee.

Racism Caucus Begins

(Continued from Page 1)
voted Wednesday night to also help
with aiding students who wish to
attend. (See separate story this

» page).

Boston organizers expect at least
15 buses from across the nation to
bring students to the conference,
along with those coming by car and
plane. A number of Boston
students are also expected to
attend, bringing the predicted
attendance to over 1,000 people.

LeBlanc said he expects Pitt
students to “try to soak up as much
as they can” as opposed to
concentrating on one area of the
multi-faceted conference. “There

, are many different areas of concern

for the people that are going up,”
LeBlanc said.

“The things that are happening in '

Boston might be happening in
Pittsburgh,” he added, “and we'll
try to absorb the lesson from what
has occurred up there.”

"The conference will be held at
Boston University with a full
meeting of all- attending on

Saturday and Sunday mornings"

followed by various workshops in
the afternoons.

Proposed workshops include
Black Studies, Desegregation,
Racism in the University, and a
number of others.

According to LeBlanc, a possi-
bility exists‘ seats may still be
available Friday afternoon, al-
though he was not able to say for
sure. Those still wishing to attend
or wanting details should call the
Student Government office 624-
5920.

Uncle Charlie’s restaurant, pre-
sently under construction in the
Student Union basement, is expec-
ted to begin serving students early
next month. '

According to Terry Milani, Asso-
ciate Director of Student Activities,
the opening is scheduled for March
1 providing no setbacks occur with
equipment delivery. “Uncle Char-
lie’s will be the nicest place in
Oakland for students, bar none,”
said Milani, “the atmosphere will
be the best.” -

Construction is presently under-
way to create with rough pine
paneling and stained glass lamps, a
Gay-90's decor. According to Mi-
lani, ‘‘It will be a fun, clap your
hands, sing along, atmosphere.”

Uncle Charlie’s will use this decor
as a theme for the‘ various types of
entertainment to be provided on
Friday and Saturday nights. .

The facility is equipped to serve
liquor, but unless the 18-year old
drinking law is passed, drinks will
only be served to private groups
who may reserve the Pine Room,
adjacent to Uncle Charlie’s, which
is also undergoing a remodeling.

Pizza, hoagies, salads and a wide

Uncle Charlie’s hopefully will‘

Milani said. “The Hunt Room

dents," he explained. “The out-

moded equipment used, the menu

and the decor all caused the Hunt
Room to lose money.” However,

Milani said, “The University is not ,

interested solely in proﬁts--we
want to provide a convenient place
for students with a good menu,
good food at a good price.”

l.etters to the editor

Onward Christian Athletes

In Support of
Christian Athletes

Dear Editor:

_ I am writing in response to Andy
Behrend’s article, “The AIA
Message.”

First, the reliability of the article
comes into question immediately in
the first line, “I wasn’t there
Saturday...” I was there. It is a
well-lmown fact that information

becomes distorted when obtained

second-handedly.

The second suspicion enters at the
end of -the ﬁfth paragraph, “Then
Jesus came into my life...” where
the “...” is employed to mean,
“Jesus taught Ben Garner how to
ﬁre in 20-footers and stick his man
on defense.” Is that what Ben
Garner said in place of the “...?” Is
that what he said at any time? I
don’t recall him making any such
Rather Jesus was
given credit by each speaker for
transforming his life positively, not
his abilities.

The third suspicion comes when
Behrend says that “Garner found
his way into the" Wichita State’s
starting -line-up.” Garner never
said that he ever started.

The “laugh” comes after reading
“The AIA Message” and detecting
the obvious naivete of the writer. I
admire men who give credit to
Christ publicly for changing their
lives. Who can say he hasn’t? The

laugh is on the scorner who hasn’t ,

the backbone to assert anything bu

criticism. .
Sincerely,
Ron Brown

No Laugh Came
After the Game

Dear Editor, ,

. It is a very sad thing for a person
to base his -opinions regarding
important matters on second-hand
information, and even that from
only one source. It is so easy to be
misinformed, or to misunderstand.
Newspapermen should especially
be aware of this. For this reason
we ﬁnd it incredible that Andy
Behrend would write and publish
an article for a public media
regarding an event he did not
attend, consult only one. source,
and voice such denouncing opin-
ions concerning the Athletes In
Action program following the bas-
ketball game on February 8.

It is true that the AIA said that
they were playing basketball for
Jesus Christ; however, at no time
did any one of them claim that
Jesus had taught him “to fire in

20-footers and stick his man on
defense.” They did not encourage
youngsters to “consult that big
referee in the sky” in order to
become basketball superstars.
They spoke of something far more
important that swishing 20-footers.
Two of them shared their own
struggle against the emptiness and
the meaninglessness in their life
(an important understanding for a

youngster who may believe that all .

happiness and meaning is to be
found  success).
offered to those who stayed to hear
their presentation was not one easy
step to basketball stardom; no,
they spoke of the way in which
anyone. could find meaningful
existence, that is by a personal
relationship with Jesus Christ.

Mr. Behrend was either misin-
formed by his friend or he mis-
understood his report. In either
case he relied upon second-hand
information which resulted in a
misleading article. The sources
should be checked more fully. On
February 13, 20, 27 and March 6 at
7:30 pm in the Student Union, the
Fellowship of Christian Athletes is
sponsoring a special series of talks
and discussions regarding impor-
tant questions in the Christian
faith. We invite you, Mr.,Behrend;
come see for yourself. It will not be
one easy step to journalistic acu-
men, but it could offer something
so much more important.

Sincerely

The Fellowship of ’

Christian Atheltes

Some Journalistic
Advice Offered  

Dear Editors,

First ‘of all, I would be very
surprised’ if this letter was
published in the Pitt News. The
reason ‘for this is that they refused
to print any of our articles before

the Josh McDowell lectures and the *

Athletes in Action basketball
game. Therefore, anyone who
attended these two campus events
knew about them only from word of
mouth or because of posters
scattered around Pitt. I -

I am particularly upset .over an
article titled “The AIA Message”
my Andy Behrend in the February
10 issue of the Pitt News.

The careful reader should see one
mistake right away. Mr. Behrend
writes that: “I wasn’t there
Saturday...,” which implies that
his information is second hand at
best in addition to being false. The
fact is that Andy Behrend’s article
is far from being accurate. I know,
because I was at the game. Ben
Garner didn’t say anything to the
effect that he was sitting on a

 

0,/an LY
SENT’

What they I

bench, and then Jesus came into
his life, Hocus Pocus. . Jesus
doesn’t pop into anyone’s life, just
like that. Instead, Mr. Garner
statedlthat he personally invited
Christ to come into his life (Rev.
3:20). Furthermore, Jesus didn’t
teach Ben Garner how to ﬁre in 20
footers. That’s absurd. Jesus does
not change Ben’s or anyone’s
performance. He changes lives.
Mr. Garner said that he exper-
ienced a change in love, joy, peace,
gentleness and faith by having a
personal relationship with Jesus
Christ (Gal. 5:22). '

It’s true that you weren’t there
Saturday night, Mr. Behrend, so
I’ll give you some of the reactions
of the people who were there. Here

is what three people wrote about

the AIA basketball game. A 22
year old clerk wrote: “I feel that

this program was very good and "

can be so effective in letting others
know about Christ.” A Pitt student
wrote: “I think that this is an
excellent program. I commend the
young men of Athletes in Action for
performing a great service.”

Finally, Norm -Sloan, coach. for
North Carolina State writes: “We
have always enjoyed playing the
Athletes in Action. They have a
talented competitive team that we
feel gives our basketball team the
kind of ‘competition we need, and

we have found the personal witness’

.of the Athletes in Action has been
meaningful to our fans.”

In conclusion, I can only say that
no laugh came after the game.

A Blatant Breech

of Free Speech

Dear Editor:

In nearly six years.at Pitt I have
often read in the Pitt News editor-
ials and commentaries on contro-

V versial material. I have witnessed

the upholding of free ‘speech and
press through the publication of
rebuttals to many of these articles
and editorials. However, I have
never seen as blatant a breach of
principles of intelligent reporting
as may be found in the Monday,
February 10, 1975 edition.

Mr. Andy Behrend in the space of ’

a few paragraphs succeeded in
reporting on an event (the post-

_ game AIA presentation of Satur-

day), quoting one of the speakers
(Ben Garner), co/mmenting satiric-
ally on the speaker’s statements,
and, ﬁnally, hypothesizing on the
impact the speaker’s claims might
have on future generations (of
basketball aspirants). Mr. Beh-

rend did all of this, mind you,-

after stating in his‘ opening state-
ment that he wasn’t even therell

Because I respect Mr. Behrend’s ‘

right to his opinion and feelings, I
can only forgive him for his
momentary (hopefully) lapse of
high’-quality journalism. Having
seen the profound joy and peace
that pervades the lives of people
who have turned to Jesus Christ, I
am sorry that -Mr. Behrend missed
completely “the AIA Message”
and was turned off without hearing
it. If he or anyone is interested in
at least learning about Jesus, I

would welcome the opportunity to ,.

share. my belief and knowledge.
I wish you the joy of my Lord,
Jesus Christ.

be a good lesson for all those other
freaky countries who think they can

all that other stuff us Americans
need and have a God given right to.
And while we’re at it, let’s drop

Bangladesh. (They wear rags for

hats, too -- ask Bill.) They think we
should give them our wheat and

some of them claim to be starving. I
heard once that somebody from
Bangladesh wanted to know‘ how
come so many Americans were
dying from eating too much (heart
attacks or obesity or something)
while gooks were starving from not
eating enough. See how snotty they
can get? It’s our foo'd, if they want
it bad enough, let em pay the going

Review/ World .

I have been told many times that,
to do. anything well, you should
take your time, specialize, develop‘

expertise in a single area.

, It seems that Ciardi, who read his
poetry at the Carnegie Poetry
Forum February 5, has not taken

that time, mastering very little.

After incessantly chattering about
each poem he was going to read,
dropping lines, and leaving nothing
for surprise, Ciardi read his poetry
as if it were someone else’s he was

reading for the first time.
If his poems had any rhythm,

pompous and self-righteous.
Ciardi began the reading with

John Ciardi’s list _of

witty “Mommy Slept . Late and
Daddy Fixed Breakfast,” which is
the number one favorite of many

His juvenile poems are warm and
sensitive. He remembers his own
childhood and relates it well to
today’s kids. '

Maybe he should devote his time
to children’s poetry, it seems to be
the genre in which he performs
best. ’

Because of the bad weather,
Poetry Forum Director Samuel
Hazo explained, “Maybe Ciardi

—r.....gr... s i 
at Small

BY JESS M. BRALLIER
Arts Editor

The worst thing ever tohappen to New Journalism is that somebody
labeled it New Journalism...way to go jerk.
Now I don’t know who’s to blame, whether it was Tom Wolfe himself

or a publisher looking for a new, original, fast-buck textbook but A

somebody somewhere sadly forgot to clean off their uninvited but
sticky hands. Naughty fool.

New Journalism held such promise. Promise which still exists, or that
is if care is taken. For if the warning isn’t heeded, academic study and
classification are going to wrecklessly chop away at the beauty of it,
until all we’ve got is another department for America’s trade
schools...something like, GARAGE B, 3:00-4:00 pm, “How to Properly
Write New Joumalism.” .- _

New Journalism is such a young (in terms of recognition), unique and
useful hybrid that the time has yet to come where the form should be
broken down like a- piece of machinery, labeled by part and neatly
packaged. With the coming of New Journalism, hundreds of sensitive
journalists had ﬁnally found a large,’ undefined, unrestricted area in
which they could ﬂing out their arms, free their typing fingers and
breath a sign of personal, mental relief. Finally, orgasm at the city
desk. *

But alas, somebody wants to set a few rules and charge a few dues
and soon the elbows will become stiff, the ﬁngers will slow and the
joumalist’s impressions will once more‘ be shuffled into a dictated form
of prostitution similar to writing the news story or press release. The
boredom of the newspaper’s front page will simply be recycled and the
dreary formalization of the op-ed page will be repeated.

Once an unemployed pseudo-novelist said, “Listen, let me teach you

how to write a short story,_ no longer involve yourself with seeing, -

writing, writing, writing and the old grind out, just let me show you
how.” Although the pseudo-novelist received tenure, became rich and
died, his spirit lived on, for now they’re saying, “Here, this is how you
should write New Journalism, follow these rules and you’ll create what
I call New Journalism. Now whatever, don't feel free to pass visual
impressions through your mind and onto paper, simply follow my

' rules.”

It's sad folks. For the jerk with sticky hands has again struck, cutting
off creativity, originality and unlimited hope...mark up another lost
freedom to the madmen of institutionalized study. ’

Damn bastards. .

Cuts Get Revenge,'|'o  I WVU. 830-11 

BY G. W. STEVENS
Sports Editor
Pitt-West Virginia basketball
games have become possibly the
most exciting sporting events in
this part of the country. All of the
last four meetings between these

six points or less. On Wednesday
night, the Cats were victorious in
the most recent battle of these
arch-rivals, 83-77. ,

A capacity crowd of 5,448 fans
packed themselves into the Pitt
Fieldhouse to watch the Cats roll to
another barn-burning victory. It
was the Panthers’ 23rd consecutive
victory on the Fitzgerald floor and
their seventh victory in their last
eight games. .

The Mountaineers got off to a
dreadful start and the Cats were
able to jump out to an 11-0 lead,
with just two minutes gone. Kirk
Bruce scored three ﬁeldgoals, ‘Lew

"Hill completed a three point play,

and Tom Richards bombed from 20
feet to throw a score into the large
group of WVU supporters sitting at
one end of the ﬂoor.

But, the WVU squad came right
back to close the gap to 11-8 with
Stan Boskovich hitting twice and
Freshman Maurice Robinson and
Jerome Anderson each getting one
basket. ‘

The Cats then exploded for the
second time and at the 13:33‘ mark
the score was a lopsided 24-9.
They continued their torrid pace
and increased their lead to as much
as 17 points in the first half as the
Mountaineers struggled both’ on

; offense and defense.

But when Warren Baker entered
the line-up for West Virginia
midway through the half, ' the
Mountaineers gained some mom-
entum. Fortunately for the Cats,
Baker was not at his best, suffering
from an illness which forced him

out of the starting line-up.
Boskovich was also having prob-
lems and quickly found himself on
the bench with three fouls.

The ofﬁcials called a close game
and as a result Baker managed to
get 14 points in the ﬁrst half, eight
from the foul line. But it wasn’t
enough to overcome the Cats who

shot 56 per cent from the ﬁeld and '

added 18 of 20 free throws to hold
onto a healthy 56-45 intermission
lead.

All the Cats had to do was hang

on, but the Mounaineers were
determined to make the game
close. They continued to ﬁght back
with Anderson who scored a
game-high 21 points, leading the
charge. Bruce, who got 18,
continued to hit from the outside as
Richards (18), Hill (15), and Keith
Starr (10) added some variety.
The WVU squad surged half-way
through the period and soon closed
the gap to 70-67. But the Cats got
two quick baskets from Richards

- and Bruce and then went into the

deep freeze. The remainderiof the
game was a foul shooting display
by Pitt, as WVU tried in vain to get
the ball, and ﬁnally ran out of time.

Both Pitt coach Buzz Ridl and
WVU’s Joedy Gardner believed
that the opening minutes of the
game were crucial to the outcome.

“I was pleased that we got off to
such a good start,” said Ridl. “I

To Stop CMU 

BY STEVE SYBERT
It happens all the time: the
irresistable force meets the im-
movable object.

The Pitt Hockey Club and Car-
negie-Mellon will re-enact the
sports fan’s dream of dreams
tomorrow in a battle of the unbeat-
ens in the‘Western Pennsylvania
Intercollegiate Hockey Association.

The Panthers currently hold the
top position in the WPIHA only
because they were victorious in one
morecontest than the Tartans.

Pitt is undefeated in its last 21
consecutive league outings includ-
ing a 7-0 mark so far this season.
The Panthers have been terrorizing
all other WPIHA teams, racking up
a league-leading total of 80 goals
while allowing only eight.

The Panthers will have two strong
lines to show the Tartans. The
“Goals Incorporated” line is run-
ning a full speed and giving
nightmares to enemy goaltenders.
Rick Vernon is the league’s top
scorer with 20 goals and 16 assists
(32-19-51 overall) with linemates

Denny Browne and Charlie Hagins.

close behind with 24 and 22 points,

respectively. ' - . 8‘
Pitt’s second trio, recently dubbed

“The Kid Line,” with pick up

/“s-xwhere the starters leave off. Bill

Gedeon (10-16-26), Jeff Saunders
(17 points), and Chuck Crisanti (15
points) are more than adequate in
vrelievingthe Panthers’ top line.

John Finney and Russ Stump are

performing well on defense for Pitt,

trying to ﬁll a hole left by the _

absence of Bob Arturo, who is
sidelined with a nose injury.
Veteran Joe Testa has rejoined the
team and is expected to strengthen
the Cats’ back-line corps.

But with the best goal keeping in
the NVPIHA, -the Panthers’ defen-
sive problems may remain unnotic-
ed. Johnny DeFazio has thus far-
held the opposition to one goal per
game, yet will have his hands full
against CMU. -

The Tartans are 6-0 and right
behind the Panthers in the league
standings. Larry Stuever (8-8-16),
Jack Arturo (6-9-15) and Dave
Cornelius (4-.10-14) lead the CMU
attack. Captain Mike Kenworthy
and Matt Goldsmith are other key
players in the Tartan offense.

Frank Sciuli and Doug Johnston
provide Carnegie-Mellon with a
goaltending duo second only to
Pitt’s DeFazio by sporting a col-
lective 2.00 goals against average.

Gametime for the contest at the
Civic Arena is 3:00 pm. Pitt and

. CMU players have been talking of

their meeting as THE game. so far
this season in the_ WPIHA. .It is
certain to be a preview of the
league championship game to be
held March 16.

Tickets for tomorrow’s game may
be purchased at the Student Union
Ticket Ofﬁce until 5:00 pm for
$1.50 and also at Gate 2 of the Civic
Arena for $2.50. The price of
admission also includes the St.
Francis-Duquesne game starting at
1:00pm. -

think it gave us confidence for the
rest of the game.”

“We spotted them eleven
points,” countered Gardner. “I
don’t think we were truly serious
about our game from the end of the
Syracuse contest till about ﬁve
minutes into this one.”

So the two teams have once again
split the two regular season
meetings but there may be another
game between these arch-rivals.
Both Pitt and West Virginia have
12-8 marks and both teams are just
about into the post-season ECAC
tournament. But if there is to be
anothermeeting this season it will
come on the ﬂoor of the WVU
Coliseum where the Cats have
never beaten the Mountaineers.

._o'Korn: Double Athlete 8

and Slippery Rock.—Pitt won the
Millersville tournament earlier in
exhibition play.—Millersville plac- ‘

BY JAN MATTHEWS

One of the mainstays of the Pitt 4

wrestling team is not a wrestler.
Full time, that is.

George O’Korn, on a full scholar-
ship for football, spends his winter
months on the mats.

Playing more than one sport is
nothing new to O’Korn. The
sophomore lettered in no less than
four sports during his high school
career at Canon-MacMillan. In
addition to football and wrestling,
he also earned letters in baseball
and track.

Beside the fact that it is close to
home, O’Korn has another reason
for attending Pitt.

“Pitt athletics have been on the
rise,” he explained. “And it’s a
good program.”

O’Korn is a welcome addition to
the wrestling program. He is
undefeated in three matches so far,
and has picked up pins in two.

Alternating with another unde-
feated grappler, Dan Levine, has
been to O’Ko‘rn’s advantage.

“It keeps the pressure on me,”
said O’Korn, "‘we don’t know who
will wrestle in the meet, so we have
to go all out in practice.”

In this weekend’s action against
Millersville and Syracuse, how-
ever, O’Korn will have the 167
pound weight class all to himself.

_ Levine is injured and will be out of

the line-up seven to 10 days.

This means double duty for the
C-M grad, and conditioning is a
must. Here, O’Korn is in a
favorable positon.

“Playing both football and wrestl-
ing keeps you in good condition. I
think I have the stamina needed to
wrestle like this. A good athlete
should’ be able to handle hard
work,” he said. v

A Although he is not hampered
physically by the strain of two
college varsity level sports, other
areas have been affected.

“A lot of time is taken, and I’m
afraid l’ve been neglecting my
studies, which is not good for a
prospective agent-lawyer.

“After all, you play sports for only
three, four years, but the rest of
your lifeis determined by school.”

.boast the top defense in

’ Fridaaj 1-,eb;a.;y1.4.  .Pege;.,..,.

 

KEITH STARR only managed 10 poin in Wednesday’s 83-77 victory

over the Mountaineers of West Virginia, but he directed much of the
potent Cat offense which rolled up 56 points in the first half.

If his professional‘ life is as
successfufas his college career, the
name of George O’Korn will take
its place along-side of Alan Eagle-
son and the rest.

Panthers Host Virginia

  In Another

BY YAIER LEHRER

The Pitt Panthers will have their
ﬁll tomorrow afternoon at 1:30
.when the Virginia Cavaliers invade
the Field House. The Cavaliers
the

Atlantic Coast Conference.

“Virginia has been really hot in
the past month,” says Coach Ridl.
“They beat Duke at Duke
(something the Panthers were not
able to do) and had two near upsets
against Maryland and NC State.

One of the reasons that the
Cavaliers seem to be doing so well
is their excellent shooting, espec-
ially at the foul line. In their win
over West Virginia, the Cavs hit on
15 of 17 foul shots. That, plus their
patient wel_l-organized offense
which gets the ball in low to the big
man, should keep the‘ Cats’ ameoba
jumping.

“We examined the Virginia team
and couldn’t ﬁnd one outstanding
ﬂaw,” says Ridl. “We’ll just have
to play our game and hope that it’s
good enough.” . — ~-

One thing that the Cavaliers have
had to contend with all- season,
though, is the loss of forward Gus
Gerard from last year’s squad.
Gerard, who averaged 20.8 points a
game along with 10.2 rebounds as a
junior, defected to the pros and
dealt asevere blow to the Virginia

' team.

Leading this year’s team is junior
