Held Outlines
Entrance Plan
For Pre-Meds

Students Asked" to Select
Faculty Members to
Recommend Them

Blanks Kept On File

Pre-medical students enrolled in the {

College are to be given added assist-
ance in qualifying for admission for
medical schools under a new plan out-
lined by Dr. Oma.r C. Held, personnel
assistant to the Dean of the College,
and which is to be followed by all un-

dergraduate pre-meds within the next
week.

Heretofore, undergraduates, in ap-
plying for admission. to medical
schools, were required to submit with
their applications the names of at
least two of their former instructors
or professors, and in so doing had
often sent names of men who after
two or three years. remembered the
students only slightly, and were
forced to make their estimaaes purely
on the records of these students as
shown by their grades.

Under the recently developed plan,
pre-med students are askcrl to decide
immediately which members of the
faculty they shall ask to recommend
them, and after making such deci-
sions, to acquaint those instructors
this week that they will be called
upon later when application is made.

In this way, Dr. Held believes the
professors will take added cognizance
of the qualities and capabilities of
these particular students and will be
better ﬁtted to recommend them ac-
curately than has been the case pre-
viously. “Ofteu,” stated Dr. Held,
“instructors in the school have been
asked to recommend students who sat
in their classes one, two, or three
years previously, and unless the boys
were particularly outstanding, per-
haps they did not receive the help
they deserved." -

Those faculty members aﬁected
will be asked to submit, at the end
of the year, a frank estimate of each
student to Dr. Held on recently pre-
pared blanks made specially for this
purpose.

The blanks ask for the opinion of
the instructor on the general impres-
sions made by the student, including
an estimate of his presence, person-
ality, character, and scientiﬁc apti-
tude. More speciﬁcally, the blanks
request a statement of the applicant’s
temperament, and appearance in de-
tail.

Tliese blanks will be kept on ﬁle
in Dr. Held’s oﬁice, and after formal
applications to various medical
schools are made by the students, in-
stead of two or three letters going
from the University to the inquiring
medical schools, one letter from the
Dean’s office, containing the estimates
of the students by the chosen faculty
members, will be sent.

Dr. Held believed that the fact that
242 men in the College took the na-
tion-wide pre-medical aptitude test
held recently served as a fairly ac-
curate criterion of the number of
medical school applications there will
be from Pitt this year. Since the
Pitt Medical School takes only 59
men, it is probable that a great many
medical schools in the country will be
petitioned by.Pittistudents. For this
reason, Dr. Held urged immediate ac-
tion by pre-meds on this plan.

 

Physics Teachers Publish
New Advanced Text Book

“Outlines of Atomic Physics" has
come from the press just in time to
save students of Physics 11 from an-
other semester of ;using galley proofs.

' Moreover, those galleys, used before

publication of the book, will be worth
one dollar and ﬁfty cents if presented
at the bookstore when buying the new
book.

The book, which can be used over
a two or three hour course per semes-
ter for two semesters‘, was produced
through the cooperation of the fol-
lowing men: Dr. Oswald H. Black-
wood, Dr. Elmer Hutchisson, Dr.
Thomas H. Osgood, Dr. Arthur E.
Ruark, Wilfred N. St. Peter. George
A. Scott. and Dr. Archie G. Worthing,
all ‘of whom are "‘sti_11 f}'ien’dS after

Hallock Talks

At Inquiry

Technocracy is Topic; Gives
Solution to Depression
“My own deﬁnition of technocracy

is ‘:1 statistical study of natural re-
sources and rates of their consump-

tion,’ ” said John W’. Hallock, head of‘

the department of industrial engineer-
ing. before the Inquiry Forum Wed-
nesday.

“The only reason technocracy has
become so popular throughout the
world," said Professor I-Iallock, "Is
that people are clutching vainly for
a straw. The subject as offered does
not provide a solution to our prob-
lems.”

The Speaker disD1‘0Ved the ﬁndings
of the technocrats by showing the
fallacy of their contention that popu-
lation increases by the third power.
“But all this is nothing new,” he as-
serted, “for as early as 1821 Ricardo
set forth the same arguments, and in
1831, Malthus advanced his theory of
population.”

Professor Hallock, while scouting
technocracy as a governing; body,
pointed out the advantages of techno-
logical progress.
gression from the steam shovel to the
hand shovel, for if the process is con-
tinued to give us ‘the good. old days,’
we may as well give the laborer a
table spoon,” he said.

“The solution to this depression,”

Hallock stated, “lies in further human-

ization between employer and em-
ploye.”

Collembola Club To Make
Field Trip To Ohio Pyle

 

Witli a. splurge of activity, includ-
ing a week-end trip to Ohio Pyle next
Saturday and a dinner-meeting at the
YMHA on Thursday, February 9, Col-
le-mbola. Club is to conclude its pro-
jects for the semester.

About 25 are expected to leave from
the Cathedral early Saturday morn-
ing. If enough automobiles are pro-
cured, the entire party will travel by
machine; if, however, there are not
enough, the group will be ‘divided,
and one section will travel by rail.

It is estimated by Larry Dillon, Col.
'33, president of Collembola, that
$2.00 will cover the complete ex-
penses of the trip, provided motor
transportation can be made available
for. all. Otherwise the cost will run
about $3.50. The price includes trans-
portation, one night’s lodging, and
three meals, in addition to taking
ca.re of two ﬁeld excursions in Search
of specimens.

Professor Roswell Johnson will
speak on “Biology of Human Rela-
tions" at the Collembola dinner-
meeting February 9. In his talk,
Professor Johnson will attempt to de-
scribe eugenical relationships in
normal humans with the idea of im-
proving the human race.

lNation Owes ll Per Cent Of Industrial

Progress In 1032 To Mellon Institute

l1933 World Almanac Listsl

27 Leading.Advances
of Past Year

Eleven per cent of scientiﬁc prog-
ress in the United States during 1932
was directly due to the activities of
Mellon Institute -of Industrial Re-
search of the University of Pitts-
burgh, according to the 1933 Wo1'l(l
Almanac just published.

This notable achievement of the
Institute was cited in a list‘ of the
twenty-seven leading advancements in
chemical research, prepared by the
National Geographic Society, whose
work is officially regarded as authori-
tative and unbiased.

“It is pleasing to see,” said Dr. VV.
A. Hamor, head of Mellon Institute,
in commenting on the Alrnanac’s arti-
cle, “that three of these outstanding:
accomplishments were carried out at
the Institute.”

The particular researches of the
local experts referred to in the Geo-
graphic Society’s list were described
by Dr. Humor as: Dr. A. W, Colf-

man’s discovery and development of .

bonded metal; the investigation of

the use of cane sugar in industry by
Gerald J. Cox anld John Metschl; and,
the cause and iiature of dental caries;
(tooth decay), a; research conducted
by Dr. J. J. Ennight in co aboration
with Dr. H. , Friesel "and Miss
Mildred Trescher of the,University

Dental School. ,3 ‘ ‘-

Dr, Coffman’s bonded metal process,
which has arouseda great deal of at-
tention in both lscientiﬁc and indus-
trial circles, is low being developed
commercially in ittsburgh by the H.
H. Robertson Company. Essentially,
the process pl‘O(l_l1C€S corrosion-resist
ant material out of metals and fibrous
substances by the use of a, metallic
adhesive. -Tlieié importance of the
method rests upon the fact that this,
is the ﬁrst time that metals like
zinc, lead, or tin have been employed
in attaching such materials as asbes-
tos, paper, and felt to iron, steel, and
other metals. .By Dr. Coffman’s
process a layer .of asbestos, for ex-
ample, can easily be ~waterproofed,
decorated, or otherwise ornamented.
In this way a new ﬁeld can be opened
up in the manufa.cture of a large va-
riety of marketable commodities such
as veneers, panels. furniture, etc.

Three of Major Advances
Credited to University
Research Workers

at Mellon Institute dealt with an in-
vestigation of the practical uses of
sugar andof possible uses for its sim-
ple derivatives. Among the direct ap-
plications of sugar, Dr. -Cox and his
associates found that it adds consid-
erably to the strength of lime-sand
bricks when a sufﬁcient amount of it
is contained in the composition. The
tentile strength of lime-sand mortar,
the research workers also discovered,
was greatly increased by the addition
of sugar to the mixture.

Conclusions regarding the cause and
nature of dental caries came as the
result of an exhaustive six-year inves-
tigation by Drs. Enright and Friesell
and Miss Trescher. This research
which was described at a special sym-
posium held in Pittsburgh on June 3,
1932, led to discoveries that are being
accepted generally by the dental Dro-
fession. It was demonstrated that

Pitt Economists Propose

Four Point

Financial Plan

 

President Hoover, President-elect
Roosevelt, Reed Smoot, chairman of
the Senate Finance Committee, and
James W. Collier, chairman of the
House Ways and Means Committee,
have been sent a four-point economic
program for America, proposed by
six members of the economics depart-
ment. The report has been accepted
by 95 economists in seventeen univer-
sities from Connecticut to Kansas,
and has received comment from the
New York Herald Tribune.

Dr. Marion K_. McKay, headof the
economics department,’ acting ‘ as
chairman, and Dr. Francis D. Tyson,
Prof. George K. McCabe, John M.
Ferguson, Asher Isaacs, and Carroll
R. Daugherty were members ‘of the
committee.

According to the Pitt experts, the
United States budget-balancing cannot
be accomplished by either a tax on
beer or by a manufacturers’ sales tax.
On the beer item, the professors de-
clare, “There is uncertainty both as
to time and yield.” Their argument
against the sales tax is, “Such a tax,
highly regressive in character, tends
to discourage consumption and thus
impair living standards‘. It reduces

real wages, diminishes .purchasing.

power, and puts a brake upon indus-
trial activity and business revival."
After reviewing the dangers of the
sales proposal, the statement pro-
poses downward revision of the tariff,

lowered exemptions on income and .

inheritance taxes, -the removal of cer-
tain securities from the tax-exempt
list, and an investigation of all gov-
erntal ﬁscal systems. .

In regard to the tariff, the local
economists have declared, “We are
convinced that a downward revision
of the tariff will result in substantial
increases in governmental receipts.”
But they point out the complexities
involved, and the time required, con-
cluding that no immediate relief can
come’ ‘through tariff alteration.

' “For-’i1nmediate action,” zthe ' report
asserts, “we favor lowering the ex-
emption both with respect/to the in-
come and estate taxes. Moreover,
the machinery for their assessment
and collection is already set up. Those
taxes cannot be shifted; and they are
now accepted by the public. Speciﬁc
suggestions are then given.

“We ask for a Constitutional
amendment which will prevent the is-
suing of tax-exempt securities. As at
present, receivers of high incomes
are enabled to avoid payments of
their fair share of taxes.” A further
proposal was that public oﬁicials be
placed within the income taxigroup.

' The economistsfprogram concludes,
“We wish to stress the necessity for
a careful and comprehensive investi-
gation of local, state, and national ﬁs-
cal systems, especially ln the light of
their mutual relationships."

Chamber of Commerce Head
Sees Recovery of Business

Editors ’Note—-This is the eighth
of a series of interviews with promi-
nent business men and industrial and

economic leaders in the Pittsburgh

district regarding". economic affairs.
The ninth article will appear in the

' next issue of the Pitt News.

 

By JACK BUNKER

In Pittsburgh, whose industries set
the pace for the nation’s business, the
industrial leaders feel that the worst
of the current ‘depression” is over,
has gone by the board, and that the
economic toboggan has at last come
to the bottom of the slide. Better yet,
they believe that business is now
actually recovering, though slowly.
This good news we can take from the
opinion of Frank C. Harper, secretary,
trea"surer- and nianager of the Pitts-
burgh Chamber of Commerce, who
comes in contact with business lead-
ers in one of the greatest production
centers of the world.

When the slump has become no
more than a bad memory. Mr. Harper
predicts that its good effects will be
of great value to the country, by im-
pressing upon the people the import-
ance of an understanding of practical
economics. He says, “It will have been
a. costly lesson for us, but a good one.”
Besides, he thinks the dark days fol-
lowing the ﬁnancial cloudburst of '29
will be productive of improvements in
business methods, aided by good leg-
islation.

Technocracy, the next question of
importance before the country’s ﬁre-
side economists after Huey Long,
beer, and the war—debts, came in for

a bit of favorable and unfavorable
criticism from Mr. Harper, who says,
“Technocracy has too little real con-
structive suggestions and an excess
of ballyhoo, It should be taken up
in a purely scientiﬁc spirit.” The
Technocrats with their ideas have
helped put the spotlight on multi-
tudinous defects in our present sys-
tem and have pointed out_ how im-
provements might be used'~ success-
fully to help prevent another bad busi-
ness tumble, Mr. Harper thinks. In
addition, he believes business men
everywhere would gladly welcome any
good, practical suggestions from the
Technocrats.

As a veteran newspaperman who
was once a columnist and an associ-
ate editor on two Pittsburgh news-
papers, Mr. Harper talked interesting-
ly about the newspaper “game.” “A

newspaper editor or owner must be a-

salesman,’’ he said. “He must be able
to dress up his product and make it
attractive, like_ a window-dresser.
The newspaper editor must ﬁrst know
his public, what they like and what
they don’t like, and then he must un-
derstand how they- are affected by
the trends of the times.” _.

Mr. Harper believes that, above all,
a newspaper must be interesting and,
to make it so, its editor must have a
great deal of common sense and
must use that in his business over
everything else he knows. Believing
that the successful paper reﬂects the
life around us, Mr. Carter said, “the
money-making newspaper, the sheet
that becomes an institution in its 10-
cality, has the news the people want

and sells i_t_i_n _th€}_ Prevailing St!/'19-"

forums and the Tuesday disctissioil-—-February 2;

Y. Crowell Company in New York.

Dr. N. Andrew N. Cleven, professor
of history, in speaking of the two-
hundred page volume, said, “Dr. Jones
is to be highly commended for the
general excellence of this study. The

book deals primarily with the insist-

ence of the United States government
upon its ri.‘-{ht to police" the marginal
waters of the United States, and with

the so-Called Twelve-Mile Treaties”.

“The book is written in an attrac-
tive style, shows painstaking research,
and presents this little known phase
of our relations with foreign powers
in an authoritative and interestin
manner,” added Dr. Cleven, . .

Owl Extends Subscription

‘Deadline To Februuryr .18.

Because of the intervention of mid-
semester exams seniors will get an
additional two weeks of grace in
which to subscribe for the Owl. The
subscription campaign, which was to
have closed January 30, will last until
February 18.

During this time pictures will be
taken at thevWhite Studios in the
Fairfax Hotel. It is hoped and ex-
pected that this additional time will
give the students additional time to
subscribe.

Proofs numbered up to 394 are
ready and waiting at the White Stu-

Studies Win Big Victory Over

Fraternities Schedule Few
Pre-Exam Affairs For
Coming Week-End

 

\

Tonight the one period of the se-
mester begins when studies win a de-
cisive victory over social events.
Thus we ﬁnd no school dances sched-
uled, and the prophecy is that most
sorority and fraternity houses will be
remarkably quiet over the week-end,
though a few will do their celebrating
in advance at pre-examination dances.
However, the social set will lose no
time once examinations are over and
the new semester begins. We have
the Junior Prom scheduled for Feb-
ruary 17, followed by men’s and wo-
men’s fraternity rushing. Women’s
fraternities, this year, will follow the

precedent set by last year’s Panhel-
lenic Council, and eliminate men in
their rushing events. Although the
men's fraternities have no ruling pro-
hibiting women at their rushing which
extends from February 17 to Febru-
ary 26, it seems that from February
23* through February 25, the dates of
women's rushing, the women will
eliminate themselves.

This is a ﬁne opportunity for the
men to give the women’s contention,
that best results are obtained when
no distracting elements are present, a
tryout.

Mortar Board‘
Drops Project

Find Campus Book Store
Has Adequate Service

 

“The University Book Store con-
ducts a. second-hand book exchange
service so adequate that any attempt
to establish a student agency for the
same purpose would be entirely su-
perfluous." says Gladys Pyle, Col. '33,
regarding the recent abandonment by
Mortar Board, senior women's honor-
ary fraternity, of plans to establish a
non-proﬁt excliange service for stu-
dents.

In place of the book—excl1ange plan,
Mortar Board agreed at a meeting
Tuesday night to cooperate with the
University Book Store in publicizing
the store's service as far as possible,
so as to discourage the posting of
personal book sale notices in the
washrooms and on general bulletin
boards.

“The book store service is on the
same non-proﬁt basis as that advo-
cated in the original Mortar Board
plan,” Miss Pyle, Mortar Board serv-
ice chairman, stated. Students who
have text-books which they wish to
sell may leave them at the store,
which agrees to sell such books at

prices ﬁxed by their owners and turn
over the money received with no
charge for services.

In order to make this service as
widespread as possible, students
wanting to buy used textbooks are
urged by Mortar Board to ask for
them at the campus book store.

Mountaineer Favored in 155-Pound=

Class

Pearle. of Pitt, and Puglia will meet
in the 115-pund but, with the odds
favoring the Mountaineer. Last year
as a fresliman, Puglia was entered in
the National Intercollegiates Qt. Penn
State and made a good showing
against Davey Stoop. of Penn State
who eventually won the title.

Conti and Fisher will throw plenty
of gloves in he 125-pound bout with
odds fa.vorii1g Fisher. Conti holds a.
decision over Fisher, but Fisher’s ad-
vantage. in weight and height are ex-
pected to earn him the decision to-
morrow night. The lightweight
bout can probably go either way, 
Nam.-_ of West Virginia, and Jimm)’
Giaunatti, of Pitt, have both shown
plenty of speed, punch, and ring §§ell-
erzilsliip. Giaiii_i.att.i’s victory over-
Beloft‘. of Temple, last week causes
the socalled "wise fraternity’-' to give
him the nod. However. as stated.
above, the bout will likely be very,
very close.

speigel Fights in 145.-Pound Class

ln the 145-pound class. Hamilton of
Vvest Virginia, holds such a big edge
on Berny Spiegel, of Pitt, that only a
decided reversal on the form of both
will result: in a Pitt victory in this
class. Spiegelg who lost to a south-
paw boxer last week at Temple will:
be facing another port-sider tomorrow
night. In addition, Hamilton has a
longer reach and is much taller than
Spieirel. g

Sehricker’s opponent in the 155-
poiind class is unknown as yet, but
the odds are against the Mountaineers
forfeiting in any division. Latham, of
West Virginia, will face Charley Gong-
loff in a ﬁght at 165 pounds that is
likely to be either a boxing exhibition
or a. slugging match. No West Vir-
ginia opponent for Ed. Horowicz in
the 175-pound class has been aii-
nounced.

No Jinxs Show ln
Pitt-W. Va. Series

In a basketball game in which Pitt
a.nd VVest Virginia are participants,
one doesn’t speak of jinxs. Never has
one of these two teams held a string
of victories over the other to ﬂing in
pre-game predictions, and post-game
wailings. Tomorrow night's game will
be no exception.

Up until Wednesday evening the
opinion held by those who are sup-
posed to know, was to the effect that
the Panthers would have an easy time
in snaring their fourth Eastern
League victory at the expense of the
Mountaineers. But then, they did
not reckon on the appearance of Joe
Stydahar, six feet, four inch center,

Former Track Star

ln Another Role

One of Pitt's most versatile track
men of recent years, Everett Utter-
bacli, ’31, t'oi-nier iiite1'colleg'iate broad-
jiimp chainpion, star high-jumper and
all around ﬁeld event man, and cab-
tain of the University track team in
his senior year, was -picked out again
by the sport-world spotlight in, as far
as is known, an entirely new and de-
cidedly different branch of athletics
for him.

For tonight, Utterbacli plays num-
ber one Drian on the Center Avenue Y
ping—pong team when it takes on the
Panther ﬁve-man squad on the Cen-
ter tables. Gene Solow, University
lead—off man, .is scheduled to play
against Utterbach in what promises to
be the feature match of the evening,
as both players hold good league
records. , 0

Besides Solow, the Pitt line-iip in-
eludes: I-Ierbie Lewis, Leonard
Shei'er. Clyde McKee, and manager
Regis Wolfe.

tourney, with sophs, seniors, and
juniors following in order, Gold keys
were awarded the title winners, and
silver keys were given the runners-
ups. A surprising fact revealed by
the final results showed that none of
last year’s winners were able to re-
peat.

In the first bout of the final round,
Herbert Pearle won the 115—pou1id ti-
tle by alternating hitting, cutting, and
throwing Charles Juiige around the
ring. The match, however, was not
one-sided, with Junge using his height
to advantage at times. The bout was
one of the fastest on the card.

Upset in 125 Pound Class

A startling upset marked the 125-
pound ﬁght. Fabian Mihelic, runner-
up in last year’s tourney, and a de-
cided favoiite. to take the title this
year, found himself on the losing side
of an argument with Johnny Braillier.
Bi-allier’s aggressiveness decided the
bout in his favor.

George Gambatese found the going
rather rough in winning the 135-pound
title, but found a third round.rally
sufﬁcient to defeat Ralph Pannier, a
newcomer t‘o the squad. J09 Sabillo
lived up to expectations b_v winning
the welterweight title from Dave
Evans.

'l‘he 155-pound title Went to Cliarles
'Lea}_ie, who smashed out a victory
over Ed Rosenberg. Leape’s greater
reach undoubtedly helped him in h1S
ﬁght, Charles Gongloff won a thriller
from J ininiy Lougliran in three rounds
for the 165-pound title, Loughraii was
bothered throughout the ﬁght by a cut
sustained when he crashed heads with
Gonglott early in the ﬁght.

Heavyweight Class in Doubt

The only ﬁght to be declared a draw
occurred when Gene Staugliton and
Arnold Greene fought for the heavy-
weight title.
the three rounds was declared a draw
by Coach Orsini, and the ﬁnal bout
will be held as apreliminary to the
Pitt-West Virginia boxing match to-
morrow night.

Something Can Be Done!

NOTHER “page” was writl'cn into University history this week.

Or maybe it was a two-linc joke: the Junior Prom committee
met Tuesday night and voted to reduce the asscssillciit for tlleir
class dance from $4.00 to $3.75. ,'

lf this “reduction” is to be interpreted  the most con.sl:.ructi.ve
imovc the conunittee has in mind for assIIring- the ﬁnancial micccss of ’
the Junior Prom, the group must be totally unaware of the com i-
tions that have been and will be responsible for the outcome of every
idancc this year.

It must be a blissful state of mind in which a normal COll’llTllllPC-
jlnan ﬁnds the assurance that his “a.vc1“ugc” classmate can .'-lfford ‘lo
fpay anything approximating $4.00 for one of next scIncst.cr’s cl.-;m.ccs.
“The only difference this twcnty—ﬁve cent reduction ‘ill make is flint
the committee probably will lose just that much more on every ‘ticket
sold.

Why not put aside these pre-depression notions and get to the
bottom of the whole thing by planning one dance on the basis of
present conditions on our own campus “'3 VVould the junior class fall
in the estimation of the student body if it gave up the idea of spend-
ing from $400 to $600 for an orchestra"? Or is there any stigma of-
fached to the idea of engaging a. local orchestra at less than one-third
the expenditure now planned by the committee?

Such a. departure from precedent would certainly call for some
i"orcsig'ht and cour2Ig'c. ‘Ne cannot believe that is lacking in the

Prom committee.

=l{= =.‘€ =li=  

The barrage of Iettersand comment which followed
the publication in the News of an editorial advocating the selection

appointment is made, was an indication of the great amount of stu-
dent attention that can be turned upon a lllEl,lZiZ0l1' which normally is
considered outside the scope of their interest.

In the ﬁnal analysis, of course, the University administration

alone reserves the right to select its administrative officers. This,
however, need not stiﬂc all expressions of individual or group opin-
ion from the undergraduates who are primarily interested in the
welfare of the University and its charges. Such comment as has
ibeen givenpublication in the News on the question fortunately has
not, vio_l3_1_t,e(l ordinary standards of good taste; this and the fact of
‘Its’cvidc"nt sincerity should give it some value as one factor determin-
ing the ﬁnal selection.

Mortar Board’ s activity in attempting to provide book
exchange service for students who are unable to purchase ne * text-
books each semester is none the less commendable because it failed to
materialize in the form of a new campus exchange.

VVhilo probably never utilized to its fullest extent, the Univer-
sity Book Store has provided a non-proﬁt second-hand exchange
service for some time. After investigation, Mortar Board has decid-
ed to publicize and support this service rather than duplicate it with
one of their own. Students now may begin to take advaiitagc of the
existing facilities furnished by the University.

The act of a campus honorary fraternity in using its influence to
effect needed improvements is an encouraging sign. Mortar Board

should extend this policy to other phases of student. life.

8 .. With, this issue, the News has reached the half-way a
mark in its first year as a semi-weekly publication. Many of the
problems attending the change from a. weekly newspaper already
have been solved by the experience of the past four months. Otlicrs
remain for solution; we have not yet sighted ginytliing like perfec-.
tion.
. Considered an extremely risky venture at the beginning of the
current school year, the idea of expanding the publication in :1 time
of depression now might seem a little less far-fetched to the most
skeptical of our critics. This statement, in all justice to the latter,
should be tempered with the remark, “But you are not yet out of‘
the woods,” Perhaps not, but we think our original path is the one
way out. ’ ' ' ’ ’

More than anything else, the News is interested in knowing in
what ways it has failed, what possibilities it has overlooked in at-
tempting to meet the service requirements of a University student
body. This knowledge, both of success and of failure, can only come
from our readers. At this particular time, it would be most welcome
information.

Dr. F. M. Clapp Organizes
New Frick Art Museum

The collection is at present housed
in the Chateau, the Frick home in
New York City, which is now being
converted into an art. museum. It is,
expected that the museum will be
opened to the public in about a year.

Dr. Clapp, now on leave of absence
from the University, has been acting
in an advisory capacity to the project
for the past year. It has been an-
nounced that he probably will con-
tlnue as director after the opening of
the museum to the public.

Dr. F. M. Mortimer Clapp, head of
the department of ﬁne arts, has been
appointed organizing director of the
new" Frick Art Museum,‘ the institu-
tion Whiclm when completed, will
house the Frick art collection, recog-
nized as one of the most important
private art collections in the world.

'We often womler nowadays whether
there was ever such an age as ours so
conducive to superﬁcial and fallacious
critical thinking, Usually, the thought
comes to us after we ourselves have
been caught up in some literary nov-
elty, in some new emphasis which
seemed for the moment a realization
of a truth that has long‘ lain dormant
and looked-for.
blamed for this; such enthusiasm is
the common and natural consequence
of a time in which we question today
the ideas we championed so ardently
a week ago.

The censure lies in the fact that
many never realize the fallacy and go
blithely along, changing like a chamel-
eon with each passing, colorful in-
terest. The newest to them is great-
est because it is different and less
comprchen.-:.ible. And this attitude is
not hard to understand. For an ap-
preciution, or whatever name it liar-
bors under, which has never reached
a concept of principles through which
artistic expression in any ﬁeld gains
order and inuIgination—i_ e., intelli-
gence and be‘.-1uty—can in no sense be
-.I.nytlIiII_c; more than it superﬁcial ex-
citenient over something which it does
not understand.

The Chameleon Critic

lVe ﬁnd this chaxneleon everywliere.
In the galleries, he is the person who
stands gloatiilg before a Matisse when
a RembI'z:Indt has left him cold a. mo-
ment before; at. the concert, he nods
slecpily through four movements of
u. Brahms symphony, only to rise with
beaming face and thunderous ap-
plause at the close of a. Prokofney
encore. He is certain to find in e. e.
cumnnngs u ﬁnal satisfaction which
Shakespeare scarcely hinted at. Some-
times, he even writes poetry himself,

IL kind of freoverse showing neither

law nor taste but which, in his ill-
concealed Self-‘clC(?l3.11lEltl0l1, he re-
gards as 21 profound expression of his
nIa.tu1'it;v.

You seldom mi;-:.take him. He al-
ways puts the superﬁcial above the
signiﬁcant, the exotic and now before
the substantially declared. To him,
the modern, by its very proximity, is
more vivid and true than all the ac-
complishments of tradition. He will
admit the Inasters, of course, adding,
“but what, after all, have they to do
with us?” Sometimes he is a sincere,
though misguided, rebel. More often,
however, his whole procedure is a, de-
fense mechanism built around an in-
ability or laziness to understand the
past and a hope of ﬁnding in uncan-
onized ,,conten__1poI‘a_1'y work a. release
and an artistic superiority_

Art Must Have Inheritance

And what of the question of the
masters ? What have they to do with
us? In the first place, most of the
modern artists and writers are not
working in the present alone, with no
debt to the past, This is impossible.
The very conception of art is an in-
heritance. It is signiﬁcant that not
one of the modern painters of note
but has roots imbedded deeply in the
past, Ceza.nI'Ie, Renoir, Van Gogh and
Matisse studied the Flemish and
Italians intensely, copying and I-ecopy—
ing,attcmpting to get at the basis of
what those men were trying to do; so
that we cannot construe it as more
chance that the two greatest modems,
Cezanne and Renoir, each did his
finest work after the past had clariﬁed
the way. Even Picasso, regard him
as you will, plants both feet solidly
on what his predecessors, thousands
of years back, have done.

The same is true in music. Is one

to suppose that Cesar Franck Debussy,

or Dvorak did not understand and :10-
ply the unde.1'lyi1I_g principles of art
as men have always exercised them?
They realized. possibly above all else,
that great art,tl1oue:lI it begin at
various points works toward a univer-
sal center—-—a. center which is perma-
nent, which is the touchstone of all
excellence, and which speaks the
same meaiiing through a carved
Hermes as through a stone Christ.
Don't Judge One Alone

It strikes one, then, that the person
who ,p1'ot‘_c,sse_s g1'er,t pleasure in, the
poetry of’ Edward‘ Arlington Robin-
son's 'l‘1'istram yet drops Shakespeare
over the side of the chair after the
third gjumdrop is either posing or has
developed some marvelous new dis-
order, Both poets had set themselves
to the serious job of writing poetry.
That the p-urpose of each in the main
was identical, however much they
differed in the degree of realization,
is a fact no sensitive, intelligent per-
son will fail to see. So the chameleon
who seizes Debussy’s Nuages with
the feeli_ug that he has broken with
the past not only. contradicts ‘the
composer’s realized intention, but de-
c-.lz‘n'es his own myopia and superﬁcial
conceptions in such matters.

   THE FINAL ﬁrst semester grades

To the Editor, Pitt News: lure due during the week of January

I was very much interested in your 1 30. As the blueprints must be ready
statement in the January 20th issue  for use by the advisers on M01103)’.
of the Pitt News in which you Ills-iF€‘bI‘11i11‘.V 5, it is I'9C1l1€-Steel that the

lurday students (those attending
classes desigiiated in the schedule by
the symbol “St.”) will be conducted
on Saturday, January 28. The grades
for these students are due in the Of-
ﬁce of the R.egistI'aI- on ’l‘uesdu_v, Jan-

cussed the Yuletide Festival's “cost”!
to Student Council. You statein the

article that Council appropriated $300

for the affa.ir and that Council receiv-g
ed $87.06 “listed" as “proﬁt” and thus 
Council really lost $212.94. Mr. Edi-

tor, both you and your readers have

been grossly misinfornied.

Student Council did NO’l‘ appropri-
ate $300 for the Yuletide Festival.
This appropriation is made. everyyear
(last year it was $350) by the Univer-
sity"authorities'and ‘naturally is list-
ed as a part of the Yuletide Festival
receipts just as your Pitt News’ ap-
propriation is considered as income
on your ﬁnancial reports. The $300
is the approprial;ion given to carry
out the play and also to create sur-
roundings which will sliggest the
Yule spirit. The Yuletide Dance is
a. PART of the Yuletide Festival and
although it had an income of $324. and 5
expenditures of $428.08 this does not?
mean that the Yuletide Festival
showed a loss. Therefore, the $87.06
that Council has received is really
and truly not PROFIT. In plainer
words, the 1932-33 Yuletide Festival
operated at a net proﬁt of $87.06.

Now this year’s ticket sale for the
dance was not as large as it would
have been had it not been for sev-
eral unfortunate factors. In the first
place nearly all of the students had
pre-lioliday exams the next day after
the dance. Besides the “ﬂu and!
grippe epidemic” was reaping its 118.1‘-:
vest among the student body at this
time. The 'ge.nera.1 lack of funds is
also to be considered as a cause of
the difficulty in the sale among the
undergraduates.

Those who attended this year's
Festival claimed it was the best in
their memory, and this is to be at-
tributed to the line cooperation of the
Glee Clubs, the Pitt Players, the Dean
of 1Vlen’s oﬂice, Student Relations
Committee, and the efficiency of the
F‘estival’s business manager, John
Caslxdollar, as well as the eagerness
and -ﬁne work of the committee
members.

Thar.kin_2: you for your kind atten-
tion to this letter, I remain,

Sincerely yours,

To the Editor, Pitt News:
Cwens wish to add their most en-
thusiastic support to the now wide-
spread agitation for the plan of abol-
ishing all ﬁfth hour classes in favor
of a general lunch hour for students.
“'9 feel that this lunch period,
especially for those students whose
block schedules permit no regular
lunch hour, would be a great beneﬁt
both from the standpoint of health,
and the social relations which could
be established at this -time with fra-_
ternities and clubs, But more than
this, we feel that during this period.
all students would have a. time dur-
ing which to participate in extra-cuin
ricular activities, which we feel are
necessary to a well-rounded college
life, not only because these activities
provide many contacts with people,
but because they bring to each par-
ticipant a sense of really belonging
in college life, and 21. certain amount of
responsibility to others which class-
room work cannot give. We feel that
these beneﬁts to the students would
far out—weigh any additional time
which be necessitated in the revised
schedule.

grades for each class be submitted
not later than 24 hours after the ex-
amination has been held. Messenger
service for collecting and delivering
grades will be provided upon tele-
phone request to the Office of the
Registra1'.

Speaking to the Interracial Club in
the Activities Building last Friday,
Dr. Jose Vanzuela, Mexican consul
for the Pittsburgh district, stated that
one may c-ousicler Mexico as either an
older or :1. later country than the "U.
S. in development, Years before the
printing press was introduced into the
U, S., the Aztec Indians in Mexico had
developed printing and publishing.
The first university in North America.
was founded in Mexico.

Dr. Vanzuela was Slightly puzzled as
to how Americans can talk of “the

cial history, Vanzuela defended the
policy of Mexico in taking away con-
trol of the country from the few rich
and the church. Now, he said, the
laborer is given a tract of land, from
which the government derives ﬁve
per cent of the income after three
years. There is no racial prejudice
in Mexico according to the consul, the
races iI1termar1*yiI1g freely.

\Vl1en Dr. Vanzuela, was asked the
condition of the relations between
Mexico hnd the U, S., he replied that
the conditions were 1’u.vo1'able now,
and that in the future there can be
nothing but a greater cordiality be-
tween the two countries, if the ex-
ploitation of Mexico by American
capitalists doesn’t become too appar-
ent.

'l‘o Dr. Matilda. M. Brooks, who re-
ceived hcr doctoI"s degree at Pitt two
years ago, goes the credit for the dis-
COVe1‘_v of methylene blue, an antidote

for carbon monoxide and cyanide
poisonings.

“This,” according to “Science,” of-
ficial organ of the American Associa-
tion for the Advancement of Science,
“is an epochal contribution to medi-
cine and the welfare of mankind if
only one—half of the several thousand
persons now killed by those poisons
can be saved.”

Dr. Brooks, working in the depart-
ment of zoology of the University of
California, hit upon the idea of using
the common bacteriological stain as
an antidote when she read of earlier
experiments that showed l10w methy-

lenc blue counteracts the effect of
cyanide on yeast and other forms of
plant life. She took the next step and
tried the elfect of that c-.lIemic;Il on
animals that had been poi.~;one(l_, find-
ing it u :-‘ilccessful antidote with small
mammals such as mice and guliie-.v
pigs.

In 21 report of her work to the So-
ciety for Experimental Biology and
Medicine in April, 1932, she siiggestcd
the use of methylene blue in human
cases, but it was not until last month
that it was Sl1CCeSSflllly applied.

As a result of its slicizcssflxl use,
methylene blue may become part of

to proving valuable as ﬁre and police
rescue squad equipment, .-jstatecl DI‘. J.

Exemptions

Then there are those things
called exemptions (for those who
are lucky enough). One senior at
Massachusetts State was so sur-
prised upon finding his name
among those exempted from the
final exams that he photographed
the list to show his parents. An-
other stude visited the lists sev-
eral times a day to make sure
his name wasn’t erased because

it was placed there by mistake.

ment, but also other student groups
who, through their cooperation with,
and support of this plan will help to
bring about this much needed change
