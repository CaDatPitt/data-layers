Q Homecoming Weekend ‘Swinging’
my

Overcoming such obstacles as rain, Sherri Lee, and “Irv-
ing,” Homecoming 1968 started, and thus far looks like one of
the best ever. ,

Although the weather “dampened’-’ the bonfire at Bubbles
Field, it had no effect on the thousands of people who turned out
to see Bob Hope and company in the Field House" last night.

“The Great One” proved as entertaining in person as he
has been in movies and on television. He displayed a quick wit
and added a few7“local” jokes to complement his humorous
analysis of politics, fellow entertainers, and society today.

Mosque tonight at 8 p.m., will have a tough act to follow in Bob
Hope, but her success ove-r the years guarantees a first rate show.

ble, an upcoming group on the popular scene.

In addition to a gala halftime show, tomorrow’s game with

 try. ”

A semi-formal dance, from 9:30 p.m. to 1 a.m., in Webster
Hall tomorrow will be the final. event of the weekend. Music will

The latest addition to the stu-
dent service offices on the second
floor of the SU is the Graduate
and Career Information Center.
This center is sponsored by the
Placement Service and the Coun
seling Center.

The library is operating on a
grant from the Alcoa Foundation
and is under the direction of Fed-
ie Fakle, who works as a combin-
ation counselor and librarian.
She has a background in both
counseling and library work.

Miss Fakle feels that “stu-

can go in order to discover infor-
mation about career opportuni-
ties and at the same time realize
whether they have the potential
for that field.“ The library is a
repository of general vocational
and graduate school information.

Another aspect of the library
is that the personnel “aim to cre-
ate a warm. friendly atmos
phere where students can come
to talk to other students by ex
pressing interest in the various
fields of career choice." accord

ing to Miss Fakle.

The people. involved in this
work are trying to promote an
interest in any field and may be
able to refer students to other

  Election Malaise

We live in an era of confrontation. The politicians con-
front the ignorant masses. And some of the enlightened elec-
torate confront the hapless politicians. All of this leads to con-
fusion, ignorance and malaise.

Many of the “silent Americans” or the “good people”
are frustrated with the “student anarchists” and have latched
on the fascist coattails of former Alabama Governor George
Wallace. Meanwhile, students disaffected with the system
because of the assassination of Robert F. ‘Kennedy and the de-
feat of Senator Eugene McCarthy look to the symbolic can-
didacy of Dick Gregory who says the nation is governed by
a whole slew of “old fools.” Gregory talked straight, and is

i one man with whom the student population can identify.

In the center of this nebulous political cloud lies the
crusty images of Hubert Horatio Humphrey and Richard Mil-
hous Nixon. While Wallace and Gregory have their fair share
of charisma, the Vice-President and the Republican hopeful
only draw dull murmurs of response.

The same old people listen day in and day out to the dull
platitudes and multiple promises of Mr. Nixon. The same old
people listen day in and day out to the bubbly ebullience and
good cheer of Mr. Humphrey. The same old people listen
continually to the nasty non-equiters of George Corley Wal-
lace, son of a dirt farmer. The same old people listen to the
same old things day in and day out.

This patterned routine causes a certain degree of bore-
dom. The voters are tired of the same old faces and the same
old promises. But these self-made and self-motivated pledges
are nevertheless shoved down our throats. The results of
benign demogoguery is a slow but sure withdrawal from the
political process. People lose their faith in American politics,-
and consequently don’t really care which guy wins the elec-
tion. This attitude is more prevelant among the younger gen-
eration. Students are tired of the negativism involved with
voting “against” rather than “for” a political candidate.

The_negativism of American politics persists, this year,
on a national scale. No student who has decided to vote seems
to be voting “for” any presidential candidate. Some can’t see
H_urnphreV in Hip ‘XII-._Cl.- H _ ‘ . _

uine fear when hearing the title President Nixon. These, of
course, are negative reactions.

But the most negative and politically destructive attitude

.is the one which condemns the whole political process—the no
vote attitude. Many, alienated persons—and there are a great
many—wil1 simply refrain from going to the polls. Yet, these

' are the very people who complain about the candidates, and

our leaders.

In two weeks we will know who the next President of
the United States is going to be. In two weeks, we will know
the general direction our nation will be taking for at least
four yea rs. In two weeks our lives in these troubled times will
be left in the hands of one highly polished but unpopular
leader, elected on the basis of negativism.

Never before have so many complex and highly impor-
tant responsibilities rested on the shoulders of this nation’s
President. In the next four years these responsibilities involv-
ing war and peace, spendor and poverty, and life and annihi-
lation will multiply and become even more complex. The
next man in the White House will have to maintain a delicate
balance between black and white, right and left, and reac-
tionary and radical. These very difficult tasks will have to
involve great amounts of courage, maturity, and keen per-
ception.

of the candidates-, for the fate of our personal future lies with
the speculative judgment of our next President.

working. I was driving my cab.
Anyway, it was about 9:30”a.m.
and I got this call to go to Fox’s
Bar and Lounge for Bill Bailey.
This ought to be a real winner,
I thought. Bill Bailey. Oh, well,
I hope I don’t get robbed.

I parkedin front of the place
and went in to find Bill Bailey
and make him please come home,
or take him where he wanted
to go. I asked the bartender, “Some-
one here named Bailey call for a
cab?” He pointed over to a drunk-
en figure sprawled over ‘a corner
table. I walked over to him and
said, “Cab here.” He peered up
at me with his blood-shot eyes and
struggled to his feet.

JUST‘ A MINUTE, shonny, I’ll
be out in a munute,” he croaked.
I waited outside and sure enough,
in a minute, old Bill came strag-
gling out. He looked at me doubt-
fully and said, “Wait a minute.
kid, you don’t know where I’m
going.”

“Well how could I, you haven’t
told md yet,” I said.

A “Aw, you wouldn’t know where -

it was anyway. ”
“Well at least tell me where it
is.”

“64l Evergreen Road,” he said
with a frown.

“THAT’S IN Millvale, isn’t it?
I know where it it.”

“Shay, you’re all right, kid,”
he drawled, “didn’t think you knew
where it was at.”

He heaved himself into the back

and we started a conversation. He ‘

said I looked young for a cab
driver, and I told him I was going
to Pitt, and this was my part-
time job. He asked me what I
was going to be, and with some fast
thinking (since I don’t really
know) I told him I was in journal-
ism. He said, “Yeah, that's a good
field, journalism. They need plenty
of them guys . . . hey, what are
they, anyway?”

I STARTED to laugh at this old
drunk but caught myself in time,
and dutifully explained to him
what journalism was. Then he
asked me if we could stop at a li-
quor store, for he needed a little
stuff't0 “tide him over.” After
he bought the liquor we continued

Over The Edge

Today’s Next Court Case:
ROTC Versus ‘Democracy’

 

By DAVID ROSENBLUM
Staff Columnist

Last Tuesday. at a peaceful con-
frontation between a group of con-
cerned members of this univer-
sity and Major Gordon. highest
ranking officer at the ROTC lev-
el, Thomas McKenzie was will-
fully assaulted by Sgt. Benedict
Bostwick, a member of the U.S.
Army and a member of the fac-
ulty at the University.

Sgt. Bostwick grabbed McKen-
zie by the lapels of the officer’s
jacket which ‘ McKenzie had

bought in an Army Surplus store.
informed him that he was not
the official

allowed to wear

Army buttons
that were on
the jacket. and
then proceed-
ed to pull a
knife from his
pocket and cut
off the buttons.
This blatant
act of assault.
without any
legal authori- .
ty to act, was ' .

shocking to everyone who wit-
nessed it. But in effect, the ac-
tion taken by Sergeant Bostwick

 

is a microcosmic example of the

problem that ROTC presents to
this university in particular, and
to the entire higher educational
system in general.

THE DECISION that most
people will reach. if they are
sympathetic toward the sergeant
and in some manner attempt to
rationally defend him. would be
that he was emotionally upset
:by the fact that a group of dis-
sentershad come to confront him.
and that McKenzie in particular
was trying to make a mockery of
the uniform which every member
of the Army holds as sacred.

But probing deeper into this
rationale. the disgusting action
that the sergeant undertook can

. only be attributed to the fact

that he never had any type of
dialogue with a person such as
McKenzie, who does not happen
to hold the ROTC program in

. his highest esteem. This lack of

dialogue made the sergeant to-
tally ignorant to the views of

McKenzie. and actually forced.

him to use the only type of dia-
logue that most sergeants have
been taught. that of physical co-
ercion.

THE LACK OF dialogue be-
tween people who do not agree
withthe ROTC and members of
the department . was magnified
even furthur when four represen-
tatives of the group asked Major
Gordon if it would be possible to
set up a public debate on the
ROTC issue. The major said he
would have to check with his
superior officer before he could

say anything because if he spoke
at a debate. he would be speak
ing for the U.S.Army and he did
not feel that he should do this.

It is easy to understand the

major’s reluctance to speak on_

this issue. since he is a member
of the Army: but the fact re-
mains clear that a. faculty mem-

ber at this university is not free‘

to discuss an important issue un-
less he: gets the ‘go-ahead from
his superior officer. who will
have to checktwith someone who
is outside this university.

THE FACT that someone out
side the university is controlling
one of our faculty members is
one of the major reasons why
ROTC should not exist as a
course that can be taken for cre-

dit. And the fact that someone.

outside the university does not
allow a faculty member to voice

. his opinions or receive the opin

ions of others. is why Sgt. Bost
wick assaulted McKenzie.

The Sergeants attack appears
to be a result of everything the
ROTC program fosters. During
the act of cutting off the buttons.
the sergeant commented that he
did not know if it was against
the law to wear the buttons. Sgt.
Bostwick DID NOT KNOW if
he had the legal authority to re-
move the buttons. and yet he pro-
ceeded to do so, spurred on by his
uncontrolable emotions. The set‘

  

geant must be made to realize
that this utterly-gross offense
does not reflect his attitude alone.
but also the attitude of the ma-
jor. the students participating in
ROTC. and every other man who
wears a uniform. It is very easy
for a casual observer to equate
the sergeant's action with the
standard Army operating pro-
ceedure for dealing with dis-
senting civilians.

McKENZIE HAS every legal
right to press for a criminal

_ suit of assault and battery. which-

would entail the arresting of the
sergeant; but he has said he
would rather have a public apol

ogy made by either the sergeant.
or the entire ROTC department.

This apology should not only
be directed to McKenzie. but to
every person. civilian or other-
wise. who wasoffended by this
most unfortunate incident.

Similarly. along with this apo-
logy should come an agreement
from the ROTC department to
publicly debate the issue of
whether the military has a place

on campus. and assurance that’

further dialogue between both
sides will be possible.

It can only be hoped that
through these dialogues. incidents
such as the one involving Sgt.
Bostwick and McKenzie will
never again occur. ’

Dr. Hoelscher was very impres-
sed with the technology involved
with this project. “Something of
this complexity has thousands of
parts playing a role in the opera-
tion. Any one of them could ruin
the mission. In this case, 99.99
per cent perfection is not enough.

“Space is the most challenging
engineering problem facing man.”
he added. “If this mission con-
tinues to go as well as its going.
there is no reason why we can’t
have men on the moon by next
summer. Within the next 15 years.
we may have operational stations.
But, we need new concepts in
power before space travel could
be financially possible."

Dr. Hoelscher, who had at-
tended the launch as a guest of
Dr. Thomas O. Paine. said that he
was also “very impressed with the
fact that many men in the Sen-
ate have a deep understanding
of the technical problems in-
volved in the space project.”

Israel’s concern with educating

the audience, “As an educator,

Two young men from Scotland
were on the University campus
last Thursday as the William
Pitt Debating Union (WPDU)
presented .9 parliamentary style
debate between the University
of Strathclvde. Glasgow. Scot-
land. and the University of Pitts-
burgh. ’

Victor J. MacColl. who gradu-
aled from Stratchlyde in 1968
with an honors degree in poli-
tical science, and James W.
Hutchinson. a senior in politi-
cal science. presented the pro-
position for the Government (the
aifirmativel. i-’esolved: The Pol-
itics of the Streets are the Politics
of Violence. Speaking for the
Opposition (the negative") were
Ken Holecko, a senior in poli-
tical science. and Vic Papale.
p.esident of WPDU and a senior
in political science.

Hutchinson served as the Prime
Minister. the main speaker for
the Government. In his open-
ing address he stressed that while
the Government at times sees a
need for demonstrations. the
strongest part of politics is the re-
gular system. Holecko. the first
speaker for the Opposition. put
forth the idea that the regular
system.‘ secure in its founda-
tions. did not work for change
because of security and only when
this security is challenged by
the politics of the street can there
be change.

MacColl and Papale in their
turn reiterated and broadened
points that the first speakers had

professor of speech. who served
as Speaker of the House (modera-
tor) received only one response
in his call for speakers from the
Members of the House (the au-
diencel.

The entire debate was then sum-
marized by MacColl and a Di-
vision of the House was made (a
vote). The tabulation showed
twenty-eight supporting the Gov-
ernment and thirty-two supporting
the Opposition.

The debate was filled with wit
ticisms and some heckling from
the? audience which is permitted
in this type of debate. To the
question of what he thought of
the debate. Professor Newman
raised the only objection when he
said. “The House was dull. If
there are any radicals at the Uni
versity they didn’t speak out this
afternoon. What we need is some
good revolutionary rhetoric."

The participants certainly en-
joyed the debate. “There was a
lot of emotional content in the
debate which made it very in-
teresting,” said MacColl. “It was
very good, in fact, it was the best
parliamentary debate that I have
seen between visiting students
and the WPDU,” added Papale.

 

    
 

   

Hutchinson mentioned that
the debate was a bit different
than he expected. “We thought
the Americans would present a
very factual debate with the
Encyclopedia Britannica or some-
thing like that."

Holecko commented in the fash-
ion of a true debater. “I am proud
to have won. I thought it was an
excellent decision."

Greetings from Faculty and Students of the_7 .-

lEd Stevenson’s getting  
too big for his britches.

You can bet it'll be the right place, too, because Ed’s turning
out to be a good engineer. On his way.up.

It started twoisummers ago when Ed got his B.S. in Mechanical Engineering
from Purdue. He was interested in engine propulsion, so we put him to work.

. First he worked in the project group that developed a 1,400 shaft horsepower

version of the T-53 gas turbine engine. Then he was a Fan Jet Engine Performance
Engineer. Right now he’s wrapped up in Constant Speed Drives and Ground
Support Equipment. And to give you some idea of Ed’s dedication to propulsion
systems, he spends his evenings at home developing a free-piston engine.

There’ll be no stopp'

.We’llput him in his place.  

mg him from here on, because Ed’s working for the world's
largest producer of gas turbine‘ engines.

It's a fresh and exciting field—really just beginning -and growing fast. Ed’s

growing with it.

We'd like more eyes-on-the-skies engineers like Ed Stevenson at Avco Lycoming.
They’ll take a big part in designing new gas turbine engines for new land,

‘ sea, air applications.

And they'll find we’re a company whose compensation and fringe benefits

are the best in the industry, not to mention expense-paid graduate

studies at neighboring colleges. ‘

Issues Relevant To ROTC Attack

By BILL YETTO
Staff News Reporter

In a recent article entitled
“On Cowardice,” Paul Theroux
said that all ROTC actually does
“is to teach college boys how to
march.” Yet this definition of
the end result of the ROTC pro-
gram hardly seems to be enough
to stimulate the vigorous demon-
strations against ROTC that are
being held on college campus-
es across the country.

It also doesn’t seem to be much
of a reason why Theroux himself
is so violently opposed to ROTC
and refused to participate in its
required course at the Univer-
sity of Massachussetts. What
then are the basic reasons for
the war on ROTC?

In dealing with this question we
first have to look _at the actual sit-

uation which Theroux so violently
attacked: the involuntary, re-
quired ROTC courses. Although
Theroux attacked this through his
own individual experience and is
characterized, in his writing, by
his personal disillusionment of
his own values, there still re-
mains the fact that involuntarv
ROTC programs are contradic-
tory and detrimental to the intel-
lectual basis on which universi-
ties are established.

This is not to say that there
is something inherent in a uni-
versity itself that produces intel-
lectual stimulation, but rather an
ability or secondary quality to do
so, if the student can perceive
this quality and use it to his ad-
vantage.

This is where an involuntary
ROTC program is indeed a detri-

ment. A student who runs his
university life as a means by which
his ideas, ideals, values, and con-
cepts can be intellectually stim-
ulated should not be subjected
to an involuntary ROTC program
which produces the opposite ef-
feet.

It is a forced contradiction of
a person’s individual values if
he is required to participate in a
program which. for two days a
week, _stagnates his individual-
ity, while pursuing the freedom
of his individual expressions the
other days.

This is the basis, then, of an
argument against a required
ROTC program: the integration
of two totally incompatible areas
of involvement to those who see it
in such a light. -

This, though, is not the prob-
lem we deal with here at the Uni-

versity. The ROTC program here

is not required but is totally on a
voluntary basis. What then is the
argument against a voluntary
ROTC as emphasized by the vary-
ing degrees of dissent shown here.
These reasons can be assembled

. choice.

in two categories: those which
are concerned with ROTC’s Uni-
versity relationship, and those
which appeal to conscience. But
before we can look at these, there
is one important area to cover:
the matter of freedom of choice.

The main argument against an
involuntary ROTC program rests
with a person’s freedom of choice.
If a person, should not be forced
to participate in ROTC against his
will, then the decision of a person
to join an already established
program should be respected. A
student in a ROTC uniform pos-
es no particular threat to me,
nor do I ‘tend to see him as an ac-
tual military man. All I see_ is a
student exercising his freedom of
Personal involvement
in ROTC is not the question, but
ROTC as an institution is.

One argument against ROTC
is that it should not be affiliat-
ed with the University, but that it
should be a separate program in
which any student could partici-
pate. But the fact remains that
ROTC is affiliated with the Uni-
versity and that there seems to
be no imminent change in which
ROTC would be disengaged from
it. It is from this point that we have
to look at the ROTC program.

The main argument in this area
is that ROTC should not be an ac-
credited course. This is a, valid
argument for, although the ROTC
program entails more work than a
gym course, ROTC is basically
set up for the student’s benefit
in the future. This itself is the
main reason a person takes ROTC,
and whether or not he receives
credit for it should not be im-
portant.

This argument can be e_xtend- * -,7
ed further by questioning the fair- " ‘I
ness of an accredited ROTC pro-‘
gram. If credit is given for ROTC,
then why shouldn’t credit he giv- V 
en for participating in athletics,
from which the University direct-
ly benefits? The entire cause of

'the problem lies with the Univer-

I sity, for it might not have aris-
en if the University did not com-
pel students to take either Gym or
ROTC.

Although I feel that this reason
is valid, it only opposes ROTC
on a local, academic sense. There
still remains a fervent opposi-
tion to ROTC, as a military insti-
tution on campus, which appeals to
a person on the basis of con-
science. This is an emotional
attack based on a universal oppo- -
sition on college campuses across
the country to the war in Viet-
nam.

The war itself is the primary‘
reason for any personal or or-
ganizationaldemonstrations ’ :
against ROTC. The disillusion; , '
ment with American foreignppol-’ _
icy and the Vietnamese war has
reached a peak throughout the
country, and dissent has been
extended to every aspect of the

military, especially those as- 
pects which are affiliated with ‘
the university itself.

It is logical, then, that ROTC
should, be the first of these insti-
tutions to be so violently oppos- Q
ed. And even if ROTC,'in‘ this "
sense, is a scapegoat, it is still a
military organization, and it is
this govemment’s military policy
which has caused so much dissent
in the country.

Student opposition to ROTC
is not caused by the institution
itself, but by what it symbolizes.
In fact opposition to ROTC is- “
rather insignificant if equated
to even minor opposition to the
waritself. '

The attack on ROTC is, in real- _ .
ity, an attack on the war, and is
actually little as compared to.
what could happen if an unjust
war in Vietnam is not stopped,
and if the United States does not
stop pursuing a vague idealism
that has ruptured the cohesion‘ of »
American society. '

Downfall Of The ‘Gr ape Society’:
Imperceptible, Irrevocable Death

Opinion

  

By DAMAINE MARTIN

The downfall of the Grape
Society has loomed for several
years. Imperceptibly, irrevocably,
DESPITE TONS OF THE BEST

Texas fertilizer,the Grape Society

has failed.

Everyone remembers the
subtle beginnings of the end. One
of my fellow Americans recalls
with great remorse the first
subversive “Grape jokes.” He
remembers how they attacked the
Department of the Interior with,
“What’s purple and puts out
fires? . . . Smokey the Grape.”
And he sadly recalls the initial
attack on foreign relations.
“What’s round and sweet and lies
between the Atlantic and the North
Sea? . . . Grape Britain.”

ciety has loomed for several

ably, despite tons of the best Tex-

* For Peace

Students for Peace is one of
the newest leftist radical groups
at the University. Unlike several
organizations of its type, which
have appeared on many campuses
during recent years, SFP has.no
official ideology or governing
officers.

Jack Hayes, who will admit to
being the group’s “co-ordinator,”
is also the spokesman for the or-
ganization. He describes SFP as
“a body of comrades, a rallying
point for anyone who is willing to
work objectively to end the war in
Vietnam.”

According to Hayes, the main
objective of the organization is
to bring about changes in Ameri-
can society generally, but more
specifically, to bring about chang-
es in the university. To reach
these objectives, Hayes said that
it is first necessary to alter the
image of the dissenter. In keeping
with this goal, SFP’s principal
activity is “information dissem-
ination, which entails providing
continuing dialogues on the sub-
ject of peace.

Hayes further stressed. that
the organization invites anyone
to join in its activities. “Ev-
eryone’s opinions are welcome,
from the ROTC cadet to the ultra-
left militant,” he "said. “SFP
members wish to be seen as uni-
versity students, not alien demon-
strators. For that reason, the or-
ganization is kept as open and in-
formal as possible.” _

SFP feels that ROTC has no
place in the University. Hayes
cited a recent Student Govern-
ment resolution that calls for the
abolition of credit for ROTC
courses, as further evidence
of the students’ belief that the
University should have no con-
nection with the military.

Hayes said that the organiza-
tion feels very strongly about
many of the policies of the Uni-
versity. To illustrate their dis-
content with the University pol-
icies. the members of the organ-
ization are engaged in building a
float for the Homecoming Pa-
rade. “It will be a protest against
the militaristic flavor of the
Homecoming game. and adminis-
trative complicity with the war
machine." Hayes concluded.-

Everyone remembers t h e
subtle beginnings of the end.
One of my fellow Americans re-
calls with great remorse the
first subversive “Grape jokes.”
He remembers how they attacked
the Department of the Interior
with, “What’s purpce and puts out
fires? . . . Smokey the Grape.”
And he sadly recalls the initial at-
tack on foreign relations. “What’s
round and sweet and lies between
the Atlantic and the North Sea?
. . . Grape Britain.”

OF COU /SE, they tried hard to
make the Grape Society succeed.
Some say that Lady Bird even
wanted to have an annual Grape
Roll on the White House lawn,
but that fell through when Strom
Thurmond insisted that they use
only white grapes.

Everybody tried. Senator Hat-
field proposed using grapeshot in
Viet Nam as a quick way to end
the war; Mommies and Daddies
gave the kids Thunderbird in-
stead of milk; the underground
actress Ultra Violet died her hair

purple. But it was no use. Per-
haps the soil was too acid or the
climate too cool, . . . the Grape
Society was failing.

But the final blow came last
week. Eleven students at the
Berkeley campus of the Univer-
sity of California took over the
office of the University Presi-
dent, Charles Hitch. Hitch had re-
fused to change a ruling that the
University would continue to pur-
chase grapes in the face of a na-
tionwide boycott of California
grapes. The boycott had been call-
ed in sympathy with the United
Farm workers, which is made up
primarily of Californian grape
pickers and Mexican—Americans,
who have called a strike until the
growers recognize their union.

THIS WAS THE final blow.
The students to whom the Grape
Society had promised so much-
increased educational opportu-
nity, an end to poverty, a start
toward peace—rejected it. A full
month before Nov. 5 THE
GRAPE SOCIETY IS DEAD.

by PAUL STOLLER
Editor, The Pitt News
The draft, as it exists today, is so destructive
that. it endangers the ‘very future of the United
States. ‘v

Ever since graduate deferments except-
ing medical and dental students were dis-
continued by the Selective Service, the na-
tion’s graduate schools have had their problems.
President of the National Council of Graduate
Schools Gustave O. Arlt has said that Ph.D.
f out put _as a result of the draft would dis-
ﬁfrom an estimated 26,000 to 16,000 in 1972.
This would constitute a 10 year setback in
Ph. D. output.

.- This is indeed a drastic statistic, for the
United States desperately needs men of edu-
cation and experience. In this decade of vast
historical significance our government can
ill afford a 10 year setback in Ph. D. output.
,_ Our government desperately needs men of ex-
0" pertise who are receptive to change and prog-
’ ressive ideas. We need men who can make sound
judgments on matters of foreign policy, econo-

mics, and space exploration.

_ But a 10 year Ph. D. setback caused by a
- ridiculous draft can only defeat the purposes
‘ of our goverment; it can only cause the U. S.
to become second rate. In short, the govern-
ment has defeated its own purpose by abolish-
ing most of the graduate school and oc-
‘ cupational deferments. -

_ The draft, however, has moreiharsh con-
sequences. Higher education isn’t its only

victim. Aside from causing educational pro-
blems, the draft disrupts the lives of human
beings. Its great pressure breathes down the
neck of every male between the ages of 18
and 26. Its impersonal guillotine strikes its
victims at random.

There is so much uncertainty generated by
the Selective Service System that young men
attending college apply to medical school and
dental school, when, in fact, they have no in-
terest in eitherprofession. In 1966, the Uni-
versity’s Dental School received 800 applica-
tions; Last year, the Dental school received
2,000 applications. One Dental School of-
ficial says ‘she is “getting more applica-
tions because of the draft.” Medical School
Admissions officials are predicting that ap-
plications will double this year. The Medical
School is expecting some 3,000 applications.

Beyond this, college seniors are apply-
ing for Army, Air Force, and Navy Reserve
spots. However, places in the reserves are hard
to come by. Many college seniors simply have
to take their chances about going to Graduate
school or law school—-a chance that could re-
sult in death in Vietnam. Death be not proud
in the name of America.

The Selective Service System is stuck—stuck
deep in a quagmire. But many notable indi-
viduals including Senator Edward Kennedy
and Presidential Candidate Richard Nixon
have mapped plans that could ultimately el-
iminate sortie of the problems of the draft.

Both these men—and others — criticize the
Selective Service because of its inequity, its
waste, and its uncertainty by establish-
ing a national draft lottery. Under" this sys-
tem, all men would be susceptible to the draft
for one year (19-20). - -

If one’s number was selected
at random, he would serve in the
Armed Forces. However, if ‘one’s
number was by-passed, he would
be free from serving. Thus, the
problems of inequity and uncer-
tainty would be eliminated.

What Mr. Nixon fails to real-
ize is the tremendous threat an
all-volunteer army poses on the
United States. The Defense Es-
tablishment today has a trem-
endous political and economic in-
fluence. And even New York
Times Military Editor Hanson
W. Bladwin suggests that this
influence will multiply after

Richard Nixon has proposed the
elimination of the draft and the
formation of an all-volunteer army.
The problems of uncertainty and
inequity would be solved, ac-
cording to Nixon, by not forcing
anybody to serve against his will.
To achieve the necessary volun-
teer recruitment, Nixon would
raise military pay to the minu-
mun wage and increase military
benefits such as pensions. More-
over, Nixon would immediately
eliminate the draft. Instead, he
would put it on stand-by—he would
use the" draft only in the case of a
national emergency.

a future Army packed with mili-
tary types—men who probably think
along the lines of General Curtis
E. Lemay—a highly respected
man within the Defense Estab-
lishment. LeMay thinks the role
of the military in government
actions should be increased. “I
think its about time,” he told a
Washington gathering, “that we
listened to the men who know what
war is all about.” Lemay’s ideas
present a case of military think-
ing gone wild-—a case that would
be prevalent after the ‘creation
of an all-volunteer force.

Unfortunatelyp neither Sen.
Kennedy’s nor Mr. Nixon’s plan
is a panacea—they will not solve
the problems of the draft. In fact,
Mr. Nixon’s call for a volunteer
army will cause new problems
while seemingly eradicating the
past ills of the draft.

A volunteer army would present
disorder under the guise of
military discipline.

Freedman Speaks

S Chaperones Needed At  

University Dances

By BRUCE LEVENSON
Staff News Editor

“It is ridiculous that we must
have chaperones at University
dances,” said Rich Freedman.
SU Social Chairman. “When a
student comes to college he
should be old enough to be able to
take care of himself.”

It is a University requirement
that two chaperones be provided

L at all dances. Freedman won-
ders what function these chaper-
ones could serve in a room of one
thousand people. If someone
takes sick, what does the chap-

_ erone do?—Call an ambulance.
Anyone at the dance could do
that. What if a fight breaks out
on the floor? If a chaperone cannot
end the tussle quickly, then the
police who are always present at
these dances can.

Faculty members nearly al-
ways serve as chaperones.
Freedman has been told there-
fore, that another reason for the
presence of chaperones is that
they provide a means of interac-

777

900

tion between students and facul-
ty. “How could a student carry
on a conversation with a profes-
sor?” asked Freedman. “He
couldn’t possibly hear anything
above the noise of the band. Be-
sides that, very few students are
aware of the presence of a chap-
erone at a dance, much less know
who the chaperone is.”

It is not easy for Freedman to
find chaperones. “I get some fan-
tastic negative reactions.” he
related. “Very few professors
want to do it. I never know where
to look for my next chaperone.”
Recently. a new faculty member
laughed when Freedman asked
him to be a chaperone. The pro-
fessor thought that the phone
call was a “put-on." He said that
he couldn't believe that this Uni-
versity required chaperones for
its dances.

The SU Social Chairman con-
cluded that “this has been a hin-
drance to my work. It takes up a

lot of my time to look for a chap- '

erone?’

Soldiers And Vets

I They Too Protest War

by PHIL SEMAS
College Press Service

SAN FRANCISCO—Super-
ficially it looked like most
other peace marches. There
were the disorganized throng
gathering in a park, monitors
with bullhorns trying to get
order, and people selling peace
literature.

But this march was different.
Itwas not led by draft resisters
or pacificists or radicals or hip$
pies, but by sodiers. .

The difference showed in many
ways. It was a quiet march, with-
out the singing and chanting of
slogans that usually mark such af-
fairs. And there were no‘ right-
wing hecklers, for who couldcall
these peace marchers cowards?

There were about 20,000 who
either marched or attended the ral-
ly afterward — half of them were
servicemen, reservists, and ve-
terans of Vietnam and previous
wars or both. They set out from
the Panhandle of San Francisco’s
Golden Gate Park, led by about
300 active-duty servicemen, a few
in uniform.

There might have been more
active duty servicemen marching.
but local armed service bases
scheduled special marches and
maneuvers for this weekend.
Leaders of the march had failed-
to get an injunction against the
special maneuvers. One ins_tal1a-

ation. the Presidio of San Fran-
cisco. abruptly cancelled all
leaves and passes.

Several soldiers went AWOL to
join the march. Four of them, ac-
companied by some of the de-
monstrators, went, to the Presidio
afterwards to turn themselves in
to military police.

The organizers of the march
also had trouble getting informa-
tion onto some of the bases. One
group, including Navy nurse
Susanischnall, who marched at
the head of Saturday’s parade,
dropped leaflets on several Navy
installations from a private plane.
The Federal Aviation Agency
threatened to fine the plane’s
pilot for flying too low and al-
though a Navy spokesman said no

,.action was planned at present

against Lt. Schnall, he added that

a “higher authority” might have ,

more to say about the incident.

After a march through the
streets of San Francisco that was
so long it_could only have been
planned by military men, the
soldiers, veterans, and their
civilian supporters held a rally
in front of the Civic Center.

Airman First -Class Michael
Locks, one of the organizers of
the demonstration,» who marched
at its head in uniform, read a re-
gulation, from the Secretary of
the Air Force saying the uniform
should not be worn at demonstra-
tions “in opposition to the de-
ployment of U. S; armed forces.”

Locks said, “I can think of no
greater cause for which to wear
my uniform ‘that the cause of
peace.” The crowd gave him a
standing ovation.

A number of the speakers point-
ed out that this was the first time
servicemen and veterans had open-
ly marched against a war. They
said soldiers would exervice
their constitutional right to dis-

sent. “The day of the silent sa-

3

crifice is over,’ said Steve Pizo
a Marine reservist. “We are not
weapons; we are men and we will
resist any organization that would
make us less.”

Don Duncan. the former Green

Beret who is now an editor of
Ramparts. said that “if all the poli-

' tical prisoners in stockades were

released, this (crowd) would be
only about one-tenth of the people
here.”

“We are not only protesting
the war but also the system that
got us into Vietnam.” Duncan
added. Besides an end to the war,
he said the demonstrators want:

—to end the draft; ’

—-to end military propaganda
among our civilian population,
“like Johy Wayne movies;”

—to get the military off the
campuses;

—the Pentagon to release a list
of soldiers imprisoned or dis-
charged because of their opposi-
tion to the war;

to a dishonorable discharge,‘
which Duncan said soldiers re-
ceive because “they refuse to
have their consciences dictated
to by men who have none.” ‘ I

The day’s main speaker was
Hugh Hester, who proved that
a 73-year-old retired brigadier
general can say some pretty ra-
dical things. “Conscription is not
only unnecessary, it is vicious_

BOULDER, Colo — Amid the
reddish-gold falling leaves
Students for a Democratic
Society foretold the fall of
the university and the society
sustaining it when they met
in Boulder last week for one
of their four annual National
Council (NC) meetings.

As they have been doing across
the country, the 450 SDS members
did more than talk ideology and
strategy. They acted and react-
ed to the University of Colorado
in ways the school is likely to feel
for a long time. A battle over
press coverage of the SDS
meetings may yet spawn a call by
arch-conservative Regent Joseph
Coors (of the Coors beer family)
for the resignation of the Univer-
sity’s president.

It was the New Left in micro-
cosm. The confrontation portrayed

SDS better than the two major .

resolutions approved during the
three-day NC. There was SDS,
there were the students, the Reg-
ents, the administration, the
police and the press who somehow
all got sucked into the controver-
sy over whether tape recorders

P and cameras should be barred from

SDS meetings. Although the uni-
versity didn’t come close to fall-
ing and no outside police were
called in, there was a polariza-
tion of administration, students
and vitrually all the press against
the Regents.

The controversy stemmed from

the Regents’ decision to allow
SDS use of university facilities

it their meetings were “public

and open to the press.” The vote
on whether to allow on campus
what one Regent termed “this
anarchistic, nihilistic organiza-

disruptions” was part of the “red”
carpet treatment reserved for SDS
throughout the country. Normally
(for the Chambers of Commerce or
the National Association of Ban-
kers) , lower-echelon administrators
decide on use of university meet-
ing rooms. '

Another question arose — were
cameras and tape recorders (bar-
red from Regents’ meetings)
included in the vague university-
SDS contract for open meetings?

As in Chicago, the coalitions
were a bit strange. The press
agreed with SDS that press rela-
tions were outside the appropriate
concern of the university Re-
gents. The administration original-
ly sided with the SDS request
that meetings be open only to the
written press,, not the disruptive
lights of television cameras.

The SDS National Council is
over now, but. one can still sniff
the miasms of what has happened:
boring and soaring, dogmatic and
spontaneous, useless and product-
we.

Morea’s M-Fers represented a
cadre in SDS that is anarchic,
vociferous, exuberant, and deadly
serious. They do not belong to
SDS, but are considered fraternal
and, in turn, aredisliked by the
intensely regimented and dis-
ciplined Progressive Labor (Pl)
faction that has been increasing
its hold on SDS. PL is Mao-Mar-
xist-oriented and about as ex-
citing and spirited as (said one
SDS’er) “a lukewarm fart in Aug-
ust.” ~

Other factions were around:
the midwestern SDS whose poli-
tical inexperience and refreshing
naivete made them the some-
times unfortunate pawns of what

ever other faction was most arti- .
culate. There was the National

Office (NC), the East Coast
faction which leans to PL but
aspires to top-dog SDS.

The most interesting thing about
the NC was not what came out
of it, but rather the approaches
and language used to get something.
The medium was the message. The
plenary dialectics -were rampant
with parlor-room revolutionary
sophism. The substantive work was
good, constructive and even mean-
ingful, but the rhetoric was un-
exciting and tiring. Dick Nixon
radicalism. Regardless, this NC
marked the demise of “radical
consciou sness.’-’ the thing now will
be to create a “revolutionary con-
sciousness” in potentially re-
volutionary classes—student and
worker segments of the popula-
tion. The high schools are fodder
for the Movement. The Movement
wants to become “where it is sup-
posed to be at.” »

“What I’m saying is it’s bull-
shit, dig it, bullshit to support re-
pression anywhere. Dig? Look at
Cuba, China. The German
SDS had its conference in Yug-
oslavia_——that’s freedom? That’s
bullshit, man; you’re all messed
up if. you can support that in the
cause of internationalism. That’s
bullshit.” Bern Morea, who at a
session on internationalism drew
cheers and hisses for his stand.

SDS sought to deal with all -the
motivational problems plaguing
the world, and most of the mem-
bers felt reasonably sure they had
somehow dealt with and solved
them. To implement those answers,
there was in some the need to ex-
cape that “trap of the bourgeoise”
—-individuality. Individuality is
thought to be diverse; following
for cohesiveness is the dissolu-
tion of that individuality for the
sake of The Cause, Movement,

Mark Rudd was there. A tall

Mark Rudd was co-opted by the

that explains it. Mark Rudd comes

“Senator Hartke (D-Indiana)
reaches this conclusion after the
most careful evaluation and the
most profound analysis of all
facts and all aspects of the prob-
lem: legal, diplomatic, political,

his ability to cover so many areas
with such accuracy, such precis-
ion and clarity, in so few pages.
His is the best book for anyone
who wants to argue about this war
and easily win an argument.

But I sense that at this stage,
many Americans do not want to
argue about the war. They want
to retreat into the consolation
that despite all blunders, maybe
some good could be done and is
being done with‘ their money.
This is only a natural feeling.

the fact that over 200,000 U.S.
casualties are just a waste.. To
these people, William J. Lederer

these revelations do not surprise
the'Vietnamese, who knew about
it all along and who told it to

Lederer like it is.

I wonder why the U.S. Con-
gress- had not yet started an In-
vestigation Commission based on
Mr. Lederer’s findings. The cases
he presents are not unfamiliar, to
me or to any other Vietnamese,
yet I am amazed at his talent to
write about them in such a clear
way. After all, Mr. Lederer is an
old hand at this kind of writing
being the author of “A Nation
of Sheep” and co-author of “The
Ugly American.” To money-
minded Americans, his “Our Own
Worst Enemy” is the best testi-
mony to the immorality of the
Vietnamese War, the betrayal of
all American principles.

To me, however, the problem
of morality is man’s conscience.
And only when the conscience
of the Americans is aroused do
they realize the depth of the

immorality of the war. And only

' when Americans act according to
their consciences is a return to
American ideals and the re-re-
structuring of American society
possible. Theories and arguments
may lose value with time and
clever rationalizations, but when
a man acts on the call of his con-
science, he not only commits his
own life to this act but generates
a moral power which humanizes
his fellow men.

In this sense, Alice Lynd (‘.‘We
Won’t Go”) is necessary reading
for all truly patriotic and truly

human Americans. To me true~

patriotism (not to be confused
with chauvinistic nationalism)
and deep humanism (not to be
confused with do—good—ism)
are the basic essences of any
authentic revolution.

,in addition to Kahin’s.

“We Won_’t Go” is a collection
of accounts by men “confronted
with the dilema of conscience
which military service poses.”
These men have challenged the
laws of their country, bearing
the consequences of their de-
cision in order to live with the
higher law of their conscience.
In addition to these accounts,
the book contains all important
documents for those who are
faced with the problem of draft.
When I finish reading this book,
I feel it easier for me, a Viet-
namese who opposes the war tem-
porarily living among Americans,
to look straight in their eyes and
to warmly shake their hands. Per-
haps I should weep with them:
a tear drop often cements the
brotherhood of man more than
speeches and rhetorics.

Without these war resisters, it
would be difficult (if not im-
possible) for Americans to face
the Vietnamese if and when peace
returns to my tortured land. With-
out them it is only arrogance to
talk now about the reconstruction
of Vietnam and war reparations.

I have now in my personal
library over 100 books on Vietnam.
Some of them are indeed excel-
lent such as George McT Kahin’s
“The U.S. in Vietnam”, If I am
now asked as I often was, to re-
commend not more than four
books for Americans to read and
know the full dimensions of the
Vietnamese war, I would suggest
the three books I just presented
I say
“presented” because these books

cannot be reviewed. they must’

be read and" meditated over. The
exercise will be painful but it
will be a healthy one, politically,
intellectually and morally.

Lawrence Lee

Harvard University Confers Honor,  
Professor Records Own Poetry

By DAMAIN MARTIN

The high point of a life’s work
spent in writing came recently
for Professor Lawrence Lee of
the English Department. Harvard
University has conferred upon
him the unique honor of record-
ing Mr. Lee reading his own po-
etry. The recordings will be a-Vail-
able in the Poetry Room of Har-
vard’s LaMont Library.

Harvard is also currently ex-
hibiting its collection of Mr. Lee’s
poetry volumes and manuscripts.

The exhibit will run through Nov.
29.

Mr. Lee, who has been at the
University for 19 years, began
writing and publishing in his
high school days. His poetry and
short stories have appeared in
the Yale Review, the Virginia
Quarterly Review, and the Se-
wanee Review, as well as in nu-
merous English periodicals.

Two of Mr. Lee’s well-known
works. Prometheus in Pittsburgh

and The American as Faust,

are set in the Pittsburgh area.
The latter concerns the Mt. Wash-
ington section of the city and has
been performed on WQED and in
the Stephen Foster Memorial.

Mr. Lee’s latest volume is The
Cretan Flute. Stemming out of
five months which he spent in
Greece on a University sabbat-
ical, this collection of lyric poems

deals with what he calls “free-—

dom within form.” The Cretan
Flute was published in Ireland
by the Dolmen Press and is being
distributed in America through
Dufour Editions.

One‘ of his short stories, The
Heroic Journey, demonstrates
Mr. Lee’s prowess in the field of
fiction, for it was published in
The Best American Short Stories
of 1967. Drawing from the works
of Greek and Chinese poets, Mr.
Lee explains that The Heroic
Journey incorporates “the Greek
view of the exalted manifesta-
tions of humanismand the Chinese
outlook on the intimate manifes-
tations of humanism. ”

Two of his latest works are
Killybegs and Litany for the New
World. Killybegs, which means
‘‘little churches” in Gaelic, is
based upon a personal experience
of Mr. Lee’s in Ireland. “Litany
for the New World will soon appear
in the Virginia Quarterly Review.
Mr. Lee describes it as “a tribute
to the whole of the New World,
centered around Ruben Dario,
a Latin American poet.”

MEXICO CITY—Although these
words, taken from the wall of a
strike-bound Mexican university,
reflect the politics of only a few
students, they do reflect the sur-
roundings of every Mexican stu-
dent. In a country which makes
the American press with its an-
mlal report of a 7 percent gain
in gross national product and its
elections every six years, this may
seem a contridiction.

This seeming contradiction is,
however, a reflection of the great
inequalities which have long ex-
isted in Mexico. Even as far back
as the beginning of the 19th cen-
tury, a visitor to Mexico called it
“the land of inequality.”

A century later the Mexican
Revolution was fought to eliminate
these inequalities. In this struggle
most of the fighting was between
rival factions, not between re-
volutionaries and the old guard.
Early in the war the landed aris-
tocracy which had been governed-
by Porforio Diaz was defeated.
What followed was a struggle
between the militant agrarian
reformers, Pancho Villan and Za-
pata, and the emerging enter-
preneural class led by Car-
raza and Obregon. The eventual
triumph of the enterpreneurs set
the stage for both the successes
and failures of Mexico in the last
50 years.

In 1927, ten years after the end
of the revolution, the dominant
faction founded a political party
which has grown into a monolithic
structure known as the PRI, Par-
tido Revolucionario Institucional.
The PR1, which has never lost

_ I an election for president, governor,

or senator, is the dominant factor
on the Mexican political scene.

 Mexico City,,,

The PRI’s domination has had
its rewards, but the price has been
high. The PRI has ‘given Mex-
ico stability and economic growth
‘which can be equaled by few
other Latin American countries.

One obvious price of this do-
mination has been the inability
to effect change from outside the
PRI, Since the results of the ele-
tions are a foregone conclusion,
the PR1 holds the power to choose
officials through nominations
which take place behind closed
doors. Similarly the labor move-
ment offers little opportunity for
change, as it is make up of gov-
ernment-controlled unions.

In the few instances in which
the labor movement has become
a force of change, it has been
brutally crushed by the govern-
ment, as was the 1959 railroad
strike. In the past the student
movement has also been impotent,
due to both government control
and brutal repression.

The PRI has also been unable,
or unwilling, to cope with rural
poverty. (Ironically. this was the
main issue of the Mexican re-
volution.) The government’s
program of land reform has con-
sisted of giving landless peasants
small plots of land in agri-
cultural communities called ej-
idos. In these communities the
peasants has use of the land, and
its crops, but may not sell the land.

Combined with this land distri-‘
bution is a program of govern—’

ment technical and financial aid
to the peasant.

In actual practice the program
has largely been a failure. Most
of the peasants receiving land have
had little" education and don’t
adjust readily to modern agri-
cultural techniques. More import-
ant, the ogvernment has failed to

put sufficient resources into tech-_

don’t even have the

Rather than diverting resources
to agricultural, the government has
promoted investment in more lu-
crative industrial projects.

The net result has been to divide
the land into small, often inef-
ficient units, which have done lit-
tle to raise the standard of living
of the rural population since the
Mexican revolution.

In addition, the land problem
is heightened by population in-
creases. There is little land left
to distribute to the increas-

ing population, and what is dis‘-'

tributed is often of poor quality.
The recent growth of large farm-

, ing operations has taken up much
of the productive land. As a result,
there are still two million Mex-
ican peasants without land.

This situation has resulted in the

only 1—4th as high as the city
dweller. However, inequalities do

is divided between those who are
members of govemment-control-
led unions and some ten million
who have no union representation
at all. Confronting the workers
are the wealthy and the powerful
who have the backing of the PRI.
As a result, the benefits of a rapid-
ly expanding economy have re-
mained mainly in the hands of
politicians, the professionals,
and property owners. ' ’
Another price paid for stability
and,‘ rapid industrial develop-
ment is the increased control of

the Mexican economy by American ’

interests. The results of this is that
more than half of the top 400
corporations have strong foreign
interests — many cases controll-
ing. Combined with this foreign
control, mainly from" the United
States, is increasing American cul-
tural influence in. Mexico, ‘rang-
ing from the Reader’s Digest to
the ever-present Coca-Cola.

Although American domination
has long been a sore point in
Mexico, during. the term of the
PRI’s incumbent president Diaz
Ordaz, American investment has
been flowing in at an increased
rate. Criticism’ of American fin-

. ancial control and Diaz Ordaz’s

furthering of it are two of the topics
drawing the loudest cheers at stu-
dent rallies.

Despite these various short-
comings, the PRI still seems to be
firmly entrenched in power. Poli-

Due to lack of publicity, Wed-
nesday’s meeting of Students for
._ a Democratic Society boasted
only five participants. It seems
 that J. E. Hedges (ever notice

, the initials J.E.H. on mo__st of
‘the posters on the bulletin

are refusing to put up the an-
‘ nouncements that are prepared
si—.~to—— call attention to the meetings.

in contention.
I ASKED the Yippy candidate.
a who has recently adopted the slo
gan, “Join the Groundswill,” who
he has chosen for his Vice Presi
dential running mate. He shook his
head and snorted‘ to inform me
that he doesn’t yet have one.

“That’s alright,” I consoled,
“neither do Nixon or Wallace.”

Pigasus grunted several times
when I inquired about his foreign
policy. I immediately recognized
that he had become more of a poli
tician since our last meeting.
Actually. he didn’t reveal any less
than Richard the Careful or Hubie
the Happy has-on the same sub
ject.

“PIGASUS, being that you are a
law and order advocate like the
other candidates.” I interrogated.

at the meeting announcing-the

With the SDS march on Wash-

ization grew in national prom-
inence. At present thereare over
forty-thousand national and local

movement, SDS has recently

“how do you propose to make the

“Oink.” he replied without hesi

But. once again I could sense
that the portly Pigasus was taking
a stand similar to the other White
House aspirants.

I concluded my interview by in
quiring about the campaign. stra

‘Getting Out of Racist Bag’

By VIRGINIA PADUONO
Staff News Reporter

“Every white person is a ra-
cist,” Dick Ridenour accused. He
proposed that in describing ra-
cism, most people improperly use
such terms as bigotry and prej-
udice. These words fall short of
characterizing the actual racist
situation in American society.

This was the subject of a_noon
lecture, Tuesday, in the SU;Sup-
per Room. The featured speak-
er, Dick Ridenour, discussed the
topic “On Getting Out of Our Ra-
cist Bag.” Ridenour is a mem-
ber of the Mayor’s Committee on
Human Resources. He also coor-
dinates Pittsburgh’s Vista pro-
gram.

Ridenour emphasized that there
are two dimensions to racism.
As a result of this, he contends
that we are all racists of one type
or another.

cratic Society is likely to become
a reality at the University.”

 

The first dimension he discuss-
ed was what he termed attitud-
inal racism.

“These people are the bigots.
the overt racists.” Ridenour de-
clared. This belief is based on the
assertion that black skin indi-
cates inferiority. Ridenour main-
tains that there.has not been any
significant change in this type of
racism in recent years.

Subtle racism was the second
dimension discussed by Riden-
our. He insists that everyone is
guilty of this in some form. This
is the institutional racism which
unwittingly finds expression in
everyday conversation.

Ridenour then related some of
the social problems that he has
observed stemming from racism.
He placed special emphasis on
the difficulties encountered in
finding adequate housing. “The
Housing Authority is moving at
such a rate-that it will take 500
years to house the city’s poor,”
he contends.

Problems of equal proportions
are encountered in the unions and
welfare programs of the city.
Ridenour discussed these in re-
lation to the need for education.
He questioned how black people
can make their way out of the
welfare programs when only 15%
of the graduates from black high
schools go on to college. Com-
pare this to 70%-80% of gradu-
ates from other high schools

and the reasons for continuing.

problems in the black community
are evident.

Donovan is 21 twentieth century
time traveler with the reticence
of a silk-gown mystic and the har-
monies of a displaced angel of
lyre. His songs tell of innocence
and experience. His music echoes
centuries of tradition and ages of
love. In his own words he is our
“humble minstrcl” on a mission
of redemption from the myster-
ious forces of evil. In the full
course meal of music Donovan is
the dessert. HURDY GURDY
MAN (BN 26420) is the latest
serving.

It seems strange to find a sing-
er with such a varied style who
has not stretched his talents
thin. It is a common malady in
Rock today for a singer or a group
to become so eclectic as to lose
identity (e.g. the Byrds — SWEAT
HEART OF THE RODEO).‘ But,
above all the musical traditions
found in HURDY GURDY MAN,
the sylph Donovan still floats.
From the twentieth century Rock
of “Hurdy Gurdy Man” to the
eighteenth century, Scottish high-
land tradition of “Peregrine,”
Donovan the musician-poet is
everywhere in evidence.

, “The

It is worth noting that Dono-
van does not set trends in music
but rather borrows from those al-
ready established. “As I Recall
It’-’ borrows the elated rhyth-
mic qualities of modern jazz (not
the style of progressive Charles
Lloyd but rather that of Rames
Lewis). “West Indian Lady”
has a strong Latin American fla-
vor while “Get Thy Bearings”
has the slow pulsations asso-
ciated with urban blues. The tra-
dition of Donovan‘s more “com-
plicated” songs like “Sunshine
Superman.” “The Trip,” and
“Mellow Yellow" is lacking from
this album. In its place one finds
a more simplistic, almost nurs-

ery rhyme development espe- .
cially in such songs as “The Sun -

Is A Very Magic Fellow” and
River Song.” Donovan

ation with the joys and innocence

songs that demand a closer in-
spection. A mere reflection on
their polished surface deludes
the listener into believing that a
wonderland further on is not to be
found. What is the message the
hurdy gurdy man carries down
through the ages? What is it that
all the world knows in “Get Thy
Bearings”? Is “Tangier” mere-
ly a description of that city? Look
a little deeper into Donovan’s
crystal pool.

Briefly 1 would like to say
something about the “newly dis-
covered recordings” of the Great
S0ciety—HOW IT WAS (CS 9702).
Anybody interested in the roots
of the San Francisc0—Los Angeles
Rock flood will appreciate the
-value of this album. The Great

es Gone, But Gallin Looks Ahea

Third Miserable Year

Ends Seniors Careers

By ROY JACOBS
Sports Editor

Five weeks ago, late one Wednesday evening, senior line-
backer Ed Gallin sat in the Towers Lobby and mused, “Every-
thing’s in front of me. The best is yet to come. I’.ve played a
lot against the best, but if we can win this year . .  ‘

He made the remarks‘ before the season opener against UCLA.
The words are very hollow now. A winning season is completely out
of the picture. And no one is hurt more than Ed Gallin.

A senior, a captain, a veteran hopeful, only to see what once was so
promising become so abysmally bad. Two and a half years of hard hit-
ting and playing your guts out with just three meager wins to show for

it. The sorrow is not just Gal1in’s
alone, but it belongs to Greg El-
lis, Skip Orszulak, Art Alois, and
Ed Whittaker as well.

Those five are the only rem-
nants of the past. They are the
only players still playing from the
much maligned freshman class of
1965. But on the surface, little
has changed since those) sorry
days.

.Gal1in’s case is particularly
frustrating. After a surprising-
ly good sophomore year and a fine
junior year, Ed was counted on

as the team leader for this sea-
son. Yet, now he is on the shelf
with a shoulder separation suf-
fered two Weeks ago. He might
play tomorrow against Air Force,
but it’s doubtful. It’s a miser-
able way to spend a senior year.-

“The season’s been a big dis-
appointment,” reflected Gallin.
“I guess I’m a big disappointment
to them. This is probably the
worst of my tléee seasons. We all
expected big things.”

.....JI‘.he only .big..things. so’ far have
been the scores against the Pan-
thers: 63 by UCLA, 50 by Syra-
cuse, and 38 by West" Virginia.
Excuses and alibis have been of-
fered after each loss, but Eddie
doesn’t feel they can be accept-
ed. -
“We can’t. really make any ex-
cuses. Those points and those

games are all on the board.”
He adds, “We’re going to have to
play for respectability against
some of the teams left on the
schedule.”

It was just five weeks ago,
too, that many people were say-
ing that the days of just playing
for respectability were gone.
They’re, not gone, although they
could be. “We must definitely
could win here. I know we can,”
said Gallin. ‘‘We’re so damn close
right now.” _

But close is not good enough;
and Eddie’s time is running out.
He doesn’t have a next season to
talk about. This is it for him.
Three wins in three years is noth-
ing to brag about, but surprising-
ly, Gallin has no regrets about
coming to Pitt ‘in the first place.

  Rosters  

PG 36

“I don’t regret coming here,”
he admitted. “I’rr; getting a good
education—that’s number one.
I’ve had some good experiences
and I’ve learned a lot about foot-
ball and a lot about life.

“I was naive and optimistic
when I came here,” he continued.
“I didn’t know what playing in
this league entails. A lot of peo-
ple don’t know what it entails when
they come here. After that big
build—up this year, everyone just
sits back and criticizes while
we’re fighting for our lives.”

“Benito” might have some

which way to go, and if someone

Dave “GI” Tiernan doesn’t

win despite short ten-minute quar-
ters.

Most of us at Pennsylvania Power & Light Com-

Ex-Panther Pros Reflect, Speak-Out , -

by MARTHA HARTLE _ .--..~~  .--

It’s been five years since the Panthers have fielded a win— ‘ V

there have been victories ~ individual victories — as several ex-

Panthers have “made it big” in the ranks of professional foot-
ball.

list of most recent Panther alums who have gone on to pro ball.

Flanigan, the most recent grad-

uate of the trio, is now a linebacker

with the World Champion Green
Bay Packers and he describes pro-
football as “a very good occupa-
tion. I’m treated very fairly and
it’s an exciting life. When you’re
on top, everything’s great.”

Like Flaingan, Crabtree has
also found a new home out west.
Eric starred for the Panthers as
a running back in 1963-1965, but
now the speedster from Monesson
is catching passes for the Denver
Broncos of the American Foot-
ball League.

“It took me about a year to
learn the flanker position,” he
explained, “and it was pretty
rough for the first four months
because I had never played the
position before. I was competiing
with guys that had.

“I’m really enjoying it now,”
he continued. “We’re starting to
win under the new coach. He

started a rebuilding program and
we’ve got a good outfit. We're
on our way.”

In 1963, Paul Martha was an
All-American halfback for the
Panthers. The Panthers were 9-1
and nationally ranked third.
Today, Paul Martha is a defen-
sive back for the Pittsburgh Steel-
ers, but the Steelers are currently
0-5. “I like pro ball very much,
but it’s frustrating for the Steel-
ers right now.”

Like Crabtree, Martha was or-
iginally designated to play a pos-
ition in the pros which he hadn’t
played in college. A running
back for the Panthers, Martha

We very infrequently used the pro
set.”

Martha played both offense
and defense for the Panthers and
he is now considered one of the bet-
ter defensive backs in the pros.

Although Martha was a member
of the 9-1 team in 1963, he did
play~on losing teams during his
career. As a sophomore, he played
on a’ 3-7 squad. Crabtree also

played on losing editions, in
1964-65. while Flanigan went
through three straight losing

seasons. All three pros seem to
agree that there is a problem in
the football program at the univer-
sity, but each expressed different
causes and or solutions.

“It’s more difficult for the
coaches to recruit top flight players
now because of the demands for
academic excellence which Chan-
cellor Litchfield brought with him
when I was at Pitt,” explained
Martha. “And the ban of red-
shirts also hurts us. If you’re go-
ing to play big time and com-
pete against other redshirters.
you’re going to have to redshirt
yourself.” .

Flanigan stressed the lack of

scholarships its the major pro-

blem. “When you play schools
who recruit more boys, you’re at

a disadvantage right away. In '

the last two years there has been
improvement in overall numbers
and potential; the boys we had
when I played were just as good
ball players, but we didn’t have
enough of them.”

Crabtree, on the other hand, in-
dicated a number of areas of con-
cern, including academic pres-
sures, losing tradition, redshirt-
ing, and, and scholarships. “Bab-
ning redshirts definitely hurt
us,” he commented. “On the win-
ning team in 1963 we had nine or
ten redshirts. And of course ‘the
academic standards are high at
Pitt.”

Even the voices of the past
echo the sentiments of today.

_ Coach Banner remarked that
the Invitational is an odd kind of
meet. He stated, “There are going
to be a lot of good individuals

tough as the Notre Dame In-
vitational, but it will no doubt
be tough.”

really evaluate the meet at Can-
j_isius is because of the number of
,Canadian colleges participating
. in the event. He cited McMaster
.'-University, Toronto University,
 and Hamilton University as three
I of the more rugged Canadian
competitors. “They’re tough
A 4 schools, but I’m not familiar with
individuals who might’ve made
the Canadian Olympic team.”

Banner expects an improved per-
formance over the Notre Dame In-
vitational. “We didn’t spend a lot
5 of time running on flat land be-
.. fore the Notre Dame meet, and
A . we really haven't spent much time
"preparing for this meet either.
However, the boys learned a lot at
Notre Dame, expecially how to
.:pace themselves better. We’re
going out there to win.”

, Banner continually mentions
= that his squad is pointing for
the IC4A’s, more than any other
C single meet of the season. They
‘ have been gearing their practices
‘ ‘toward the hilly IC4A run.

— As Banner once before stated,
.. ‘-‘Once we’re used to running hills,
“it’s difficult" running on a flat
1- course. It’s a different type of run-
ning, more of a speed race.”
The reason, though, that the squad

what we’re shooting for,” remark-
ed Banner.

He stated that the Canisius‘
Invitational has its advantages
and disadvantages as a prepara-
tion for the IC4A’s. “It’ll help us
to move out of a crowd, and it'll be
a good first milerun for us. In a
way, though, it won’t help us,
since it’s a flat race. Let's say it’s
better than not having been in a
big meet,” Banner reasoned. More-
over, during the past two years,
the barriers have placed second
and sixth in the Buffalo com-
petition.

Jerry Richey smashed the Buf-
falo course record previously
this season. The Invitational
course is stretched a little longer
than the course "used for dual
meets; therefore Richey "has a
chance to establish two records
on the same course.

d After A Year Of Experience,
ey Runs To Win

by DAVE TIERN AN

Staff News Editor

To sophomore track star Jerry Richey,
wining is much more important than the rec-
ords he sets nearly every time he runs in competi-
tion.

“I run to win,” said the star from North Alle-
gheny, “and records are incidental.” ,

Jerry reflected on the effects of his experiences
this summer, when he trained with such names as
Jim Ryun, Martin Liquori, Sammy Bair and others
at the Olympic training site in Lake Tahoe, only
to lose in the semi-finals of the .1500 meter qualif-
ing trials.

“Although coach Jim Banner felt I might be

don’t think the constant training
had any visible drawbacks,” Jer-
ry noted. He pointed out the cross— .
country meet at West Virginia :
last week as an example.

“I trailed Carl Hatfield (WVU
runner who was rated as Jerry’s
toughest competition to date un-
til the last 300 yards, because I
knew I could beat him in the
sprint at the end,” Jerry said. “I
knew I couldn’t let him beat me.”

Jerry casually mentioned that
the 1500 meter field at Lake Ta-
hoe was extremely strong com-
pared to the runners in the long-
er distances. Although there was
never any visible animosity last winter and spring.
Banner and Richey had difficulties in determining
what distance best suited Jerry’s talents.

The glory of the magic “four-minute” mile lured-
Jerry’s efforts during the entire winter and spring
track season, and finally his efforts were "rewarded
May 29 when he broke the four minute mark in the
IC4A’s at Villanova.

Jerry admitted that the mental aspects of the
mile were much more challenging than those in
the longer distances. “I only wish I had more nat-

ural speed.” Jerry said. "The American runners
keep a slow pace for the first three quarters of the
mile and sprint the last quarter. I worked on my
speed this spring. but ran a bad race in the semis
at Lake Tahoe, and in the Olympics it’s all or noth-

ing. -

The performances of the Olympic hopefuls im-
pressed Jerry more than the individuals. but he
pointed out characteristics of certain runners that

impressed him.

Although Jerry didn’t get to
know Jim‘ Ryun because Ryun’
trained by himself in Arizona un-
til the last two weeks, Jerry did
learn the importance of confi-
dence from Dave Patrick, finish-
ed fourth in the finals, and didn’t
make the Olympics. '

After the blunt realization that
his Olympic hopes were over for
at least four years, Jerry looked
back to a hard year. of training to
see where he could have done bet-
ter. But as soon as he was back in
school, he looked ahead to this
year.

 '   “Last year was a big one for
me,” Jerry said. “The transition
from running in high_ school to

running against some of the best runners in the
country was hard. At first, it was an honor to be in
the race with big names, and I worried more about
my. times than I did about winning. The four min-
ute mile was _a goal I strove for, and it was more
important to have a good time than to win.”

But now ‘Jerry gained valuable experience, has
recorded some impressive times, and has set many
records. This year, Jerry feels he can look past the
obstacles that hampered him last year in the big
races. “This year winning is important,” Jerry stat-
ed. “This year, I run to win.” I

Forty—two anxious freshmen traveled to Morgantown this
morning to meet the Little Mountaineers of West Virginia, and
all 42 Cubs will most likely participate in the opening game.

“I’m going to try my hardest to get every boy in the game,” ex-
plained freshmen football coach Carl Kokor. “But I’ll be realistic too.
I won’t risk a chance to win a game.”

The Cubs are at a ‘disadvantage against the WVU frosh. The Lit-
tle Mountaineers have already played two games, beating VPI, 36-21,
and losing to Penn State, 49-7.

In those two games, the Little Mountaineers displayed a balanced

Galiffa, who hails from Donora, Pa., has been a bright spot for,
coach Dale Evans. In his opening game, the six-foot signal-caller pass-

Joe DeLisio has edged out Tony Embessi a

“Our quarterbacking is wide-open,” beams Koizar. “They are all
so good. If the team is rolling with the quarterback in, we’1l leave him
in. That’s all we can do.”

Kokor also hasthe pleasant problem of depth at tight end where
Craig Kugler, John Wilborn, and Doug Ginden have all shined. But
Kuglar will probably get the starting nod this afternoon.

Kokor’s three talented quarterbacks will also have other sure-
handed targets. Walk-on Lloyd Rodgers, who turned down a varsity
track scholarship, appears to have won the starting berth at split-F
end. But Steve Moyer and Jim Andrus have provided close competi— -

Moyer will start, however, at the wingback slot where quarter-
back Tony Embessi will back him up.

Running chores will be split up by Lou Julian and John Thissen
at fullback, and Joe Carroll, John Moss, Bill Donovan, and Willie
Saloky at tailback.

Kokor seemsto have a pretty set line of Bobby Kuziel (6-4, 235)

kles, and Dan Lynn (6-2, 210), and Rick’Lozier (6-0, 230) at guards.
However, tackle Larry Chesla and guard Joe Baranick are slated for

Erratic Air Force Passing Attack

  Could Decide Panther Fate Today

If the Air Force passing attack is accurate tomorrow, this
year’s Panther Homecoming clash will be just as disastrous as
the past four Homecoming conte sts. '

On the ground, the Falcons have displayed a solid attack that has
accumulated 892 yardsin five. games this fall. Four Falcon running
backs have shared the chores of penetrating enemy lines.

Sophomore halfback Curtis Martins presents the biggest problem

for the Panther defense tomorrow.

The Falcon’s leading ball carrier

has already scored six touchdowns,

including two in last week’s 31-0
’ romp over Colorado State.

Sophomore halfback Ernest Jen-
.1gs and senior fullback Dennis
Ryll have both averaged better
than 3.3 yards per carry, while
junior signal caller Gary Baxter

has run for four touchdowns and -

165 yards in 69 carries this year.

But Baxter and second team
quarterback Steve Turner are
questionable passers. Baxter, who
will see most of the action, has
completed only 32 passes in 77 at-
tempts, a mediocre .416 pass com-
pletion average. ‘

but vulnerable. Air Force limit-
ed Wyoming to a field goal ear-

three games.

The secondary has intercepted
11 enemy passes. Sophomore Cyd
Maatala picked off four tosses
last week. and senior Rudy Hal-
lenbeck has three interceptions to

- his credit.

The Falcons also field a hefty
line, led by tackles Ed Epping
(6-3, 232) and Ken Hamlin (6-2,
234). But they have surrendered
840 yards.

Barkin and Ken Kebel at the hot
spot were given credit for a tough
defense that held the team to-
gether the entire sea son.

Playboy House, in getting into
the dorm finals, had to play the
Hawthorne House in a double
elimination s e r i e s . Hawthorne
won the first game, 5-2, but lost a
heartbreaker in the second game,
4-3. Playboy scored two runs each
in the last two innings to come
from behind as Jim Barber got
two hits and Mike Starr got three.

In achieving the all-fraternity
championships, Pi Kappa Alpha
had to defeat Kappa Sigma for the
B League championship, then
came from behind to beat the A
League champs, Pi Lambda Phi.
In the A League championship
game Pi Lambda Phi had a dou-
ble elimination series with Phi
Epsilon Phi, losing the first game,
7-2, and winning the second game,
2-1.

Sparking the Pi Lambda Phi’s
offense was Chuck Green with
two RBI’s while the pitching of
Steve Rosenbaum and defensive
play of Joel Waldman aided the
team’s drive for the championship.

Meanwhile, Pi Kappa Alpha
beat Kappa Sigma, 9-7, by scor-

' ing three runs in the last inning

on a home run by Bill Claypoole.
In defeating Pi Lambda Phi by
the score of 13-9, the PiKA’s

In his first season as head trainer, Willieand his staff have been
constantly kept busy with an assortment of bumps and bruises. The
trainer’s staff at Pitt consists of Myers, Roger McGill (a former Steel-
er trainer), Bill Hammer, one graduate student, and two student train-
ers. ‘ '

Myers himself started out as a
student trainer at Penn State. “I
worked for three years as a stu-
dent trainer at State,” he explain-
ed. “Originally I was a physical
education major and planned to
go into physical therapy work af-
ter graduation.” He never became
a physical therapist, as he stayed-
on at Penn State as an assistant
trainer for eight years and then-
came to Pitt fours years ago.

Like most trainers, Willie does-
n’t have a medical degree or a
true medical background. “You
learn to be a trainer more by ex-
perience than by formal educa-
tion. You learn by doing.”

The trainers work under the di-
rection of the team physician, Dr.
W. K. Smith. “Dr. Smith tells us
what treatments are to be given
and just how the taping should
be done on each boy,” explained -
Willie. “In the end, it’s Dr. Smith’s decision on whether a boy should
play or not. We won’t jeopardize a boy’s_health just to get him in
there; no matter what the outside pressure may be.”

When the players are on the field, Willie is forever keeping a con-
stant vigil on what’s happening. “After a number of years of being a
trainer, you can see things happen. You can even begin to anticipate
the injury before it occurs.”

WILLIE MYERS
Medicine Man

According to Meyers, the most dangerous, but yet most common,
injury suffered by the gridders is the knee injury. “The knee just isn’t
made for‘ the type of wide-open football played’ today,” he explained.
“The new type of shoe with the bar at the heel of the shoe has helped
a little in curbing the knee injury.” «

With injuries being extremely numerous so far this season, Willie
Myers and his staff have been busy men, constantly taping and admin-
istering treatments. “I enjoy working with the kids in football and in
all the sports,” he said. “Being a trainer is an extremely satisfying
profession and I enjoy being in it.” ‘

 Kickers Meet Mountaineers,

" Attempt to Stop ‘Stomping’

“Th9,Y’1"9 West Virginia, and they’re coming up to stomp Pitt!”

That’s What Coach Leo Bemis remarked about the invation of the
Mountaineer booters who will go into the game at Forbes Field today,

 

I | -| | 1‘. I | 1- | |. |: |- | | | | | I [I I: I.‘ I"l-ill I.'IiIIlIllI'lIllI- II I ‘IllI‘ill?IllIllI|wliIl'IIl!|l:Ilal.lIl I

with some very impressive

statistics.

Game time is 3:30.

Coach John Stewart, in his second year as mentor of WVU, has an
undefeated squad through six games; the team’s record is 5-0-1.

The Mountaineers have already banged in 35 goals this season,

compared to a total of four scored
by their opposition. Those marks
are pretty nerve-wracking for Be-
mis when one notices that his
kickers have only scored four
times and have given up goals on
14 occasions this fall. The hooters
stand at 1-5.

The Mountaineers are showing
signs that they are just beginning
to find themselves, too. On the
last two Saturday’s Stewart’s soc-
cermen have totaled 20 goals
against St. Francis and Ohio
State.

Bemis reasoned, We’ll just
have to play our best defensive
game — and get a goal.”

However, getting that goal
might be a rather difficult task
for the kickers who haven’t pro-
duced too many points this fall.
The Mountaineer defense is al-
most as strong as its offense.

Goalie Dale Schoch, a junior
college transfer from Emmaus,
Pa., has an exceptional 67~goals
per game average, heading that
defensive unit.

But, the real power in the WVU
defense is in the fullbacking.
Coach Stewart thought this would
be his problem area this cam-
paign after losing all threeof
last year’s starters to graduation.

His worries weren’lt necessary,
though. The trio. in there. now
make up one of the roughest in
college soccer.

They are led by another junior
college transfer, Pat Sullivan. The
6’3”, 205 pound junior is joined
by senior Ben Farquhar (6’2”,
185 pounds) and junior Bob Boyd
(6-0, 205 pounds) in the unit that
has received nothing but praise
from Stewart.

“They a re big, strong, and
fast,” the coach said. “They have
never been outmanned yet this
year, and are mainly responsible
for the few shots that our oppon-
ents have been able to get on our
goal.”

The goalie, Schoch, agrees with

his coach. He mentioned, “Our

defense has been terrific. Those
guys just haven’t let the oppon-

range.”

This problem that the Moun-
taineers have been causing for
the opposition has not been a
problem for them, as those 35
goals would indicate.

The man for kicker goalie Len
Harmon and his fullbacks to look
out for is Walt Nistorenko. He
was selected as a member of the
third team of All-Americans last
fall, a season in which he totaled
27 goals. '

The right-winger on the line
is Terry Parfitt. He was the
team’s leading point-man early in
the season when the going was a
little rough.

-His coach boasted, “He has
been a real plus to our offense,
picking up those goals and assists
at crucial times.

within firing

Bemis is’nt overly concerned
a h o u t stopping t h e s e scorers,
though.

“There’s not much sense play-
ing an all—defensive game,” the
coach claimed. “We have noth-
ing to lose from trying to get
goals. They’re not a team that
will be satisfied with a one-goal
lead. In fact they’ll go for ten!

“We’ll just have to get that
first goal,” the coach concluded.
“It’s a big psychological advan-
tage.”

The first goal would be an im-
portant possession for the booters,
that’s for sure. It would be the
only advantage that they could
claim.

Former Booter Kruth
Sends Carnegie Squad
Against Snyder Froshi

by MARTIN HELLMAN

Tomorrow’s game between
the freshman soccer team and
the Carnegie—Mellon squad pits
two former teammates in oppos-
ing coaching roles. B o t h Pete
Snyder, coach of the Pitt booters;
and Joe Kruth, mentor of the Tar-
tan kickers, played here under
Leo Bemis for three seasons.

The match will be played at
CMU’s home field at 10 a.m. It
will be the third contest for the

. frosh while CMU has already had

six games.

The frosh will probably en-
counter their toughest opposition

this season against the Tartans. Al-_

though this is the first year organ-
ized competition at CMU, the
squad, composed of freshmen and
upperclassmen, h a s w o n » four
games this year.

However, Snyder is confident
of victory. “The boys have been
looking real good lately, and we
should play a good game.”

In the two week layoff since
the last contest, Snyder has at-
tempted to improve the freshman’s
mistakes of the first two games.
Although the booters took over 60
shots in the game, they were only
able to cash in three times.

PETE SNYDER

Former Booter . . .

Snyder commented, “The lack
of scoring is typical of. a freshmen
team. The boys are shooting ’ at
improper times and they are rush-
ing and misjudging the shots. Also-
the forwards aren’t familiar with
each other’s moves yet.” ’

Shooting drills have been em-
phasized in this week’s practice.
Snyder had the boys practice tak_.-
ing the ball out of the air in front
of the goal and shooting. Also, he
drilled the frosh on getting the-‘-.
hall on a roll and shooting with
both feet.

Meanwhile, the defense concen-
trated on halting a scoring threat
quicker than they have been do-
ing previously. Snyder is espe-
cially pleased with the improve"-
ment of goalie John Giorgio- ‘I

“Since the last game, he has
learned to move out quicker when
necessary. He has played extreme-'
ly well in the practice sessions«,’.’=
he remarked. ‘

On Tuesday, the boys proved‘
that they were ready to meet,
CMU tomorrow. They nipped the
varsity in a scrimmage, 2-1."'Al-
though Snyder admits that many.

 

tory, the team displayed its fin-E
est‘play so far this year. He hopes
that they will continue their ex-.,
cellent, playing in tomorrow’s7
match. ' A

Dependable Fullback

by ART ROSENGARTEN

Tomorrow aftemoon’s Home.
coming game against the Fal-
cons of the Air Force Academy
marks the mid-way point in the
Panther’s sea son; a season
that started off with high hopes
but hasn’t shown too much so
far. Kickoff is 1:30 p.m.

“The team has not done as

well as I had expected,” re-

flected head coach Dave Hart
on his team’s progress this sea-
son. ‘.‘When you look back on it,
we’ve been a sn_akebitten team

::- all season.

“We’ve lost many boyswho were
slated for first team duty this
fall,’’ continued Hart. “The in-
juries started in fall camp and they
have been mounting ever since.”
Some of the boys who are lost for
the season were promising sopho-
mores: Howard Broadhead, Brad
Bekampis, and possibly Ralph

Cindrich.

“We’ve. not had a lucky year,
to say the least,” reflected the
coach. “We’re approaching the
heavy part of our schedule and
the team has_ not progressed as

far as we thought It would. If
only we had a few wins under our
belts.”

On the -other side of the coin,

. Hart feels that the 79th version of
Panther football is a good ‘team,

which has a good deal of un-
tapped potential. “We’ll get bet-
ter as the season progresses.”
assured Hart. -

One of the things he feels
that the team has developed is
a sense of maturity. “Boys- like
J. D. Lewis, Tony Esposito, Dave
Garnett, and Dave Havern have all
improved and matured, especially
in their mental attitude towards
thegame.

“The boys are beginning toplay
like a team now,” continued Hart.
-“They are helping each other out,

pecially encouraging each other.
These are things the’ coaches like
to see.”

Besides the numerous injuries
three~things have haunted the ball
club: fumbles, penalties, and in-
terceptions. These mistakes have
proven very costly to the Panthers.
“These things have absolutely kil-
led us.” Hart explained. “We've

had so many long gains and touch- ‘

downs called back on us that we’re
becoming a phantom touchdown
gang.”

If the Panthers can curb their
mistakes Hart feels that they can
defeat Air Force. “Air Force is a
real surprise,” he explained.
“They’re no Notre Dame or Penn
State, but [feel that they are-bet-
'ter than Navy or West Virginia.”

' Hart is impressed with the
range and quickness of the Fal-
cons. “They are faster than Syra-
cuse, but not as strong,” he said.
Air Force’s major assets are their
speed and the size of. their of-
fensive and defensive lines,
which both average over 6’l” and
215 pounds.

“I expect them to attack our
flats with their running and short

passing game,” reflected Hart.

“This has been our weak spot, be-
cause of the injuries to our ex-
perienced linebackers and the over-
all lack of speed of most of them.”
Hart plans to use a competely
new defense against the Fal-
cons in hope of stopping them be-
fore they can start flying.‘

On the offense, Hart plans to
start sophomore Bill Beinecke
for the first time before home fans.
Beinecke, the tight tackle, "has
been‘ a real pleasant surprise
for Hart. “He’s acquired quick-
ness and agility, besides physically
maturing on the field. This is
something I would like to see in
all the boys.”_

Still slated for double duty is
tri-captain “EZ” Ed Whittaker.
Whittaker, a defensive tackle this

year after being on the offense 3

last season, played a tremen-
dous game defensively against
Navy according to Hart. Hart
also plans to use Whittaker on

Goal line and short yardage of- i
- fense. ’

Before an expected fine Home-
coming crowd, Hart hopes that
