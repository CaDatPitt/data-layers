Controversy over the proposed
Oakland Crosstown expressway
surfaced again yesterday as the
Oakland Chamber of Commerce
heard the pros and cons of the
highway splitting Panther Hollow
in a discussion producing the
possibility of the Spine Line, yet
another super-road involving Oak-
land.

“The primary purpose of the
Spine Line is to connect Oakland

directly with the downtown area-

within a ﬂash of a second”, said
John Robin, Chairman of Pitts-
burgh’s Transportation Advisory
Committee [TAC]. -

The Spine Lineiwould eventually
serve as a major corridor of
transportation connecting such

-communities as the North Side,

Monroeville, Shadyside and the
Hill District, he added.

“Places such as Northway Mall,
Oakland and Monroeville Mall will
all become easily accessible.

“In my judgement, an Oakland
directly connected with the down-
town area would be a flouribhing
place. A great city center instead
of just the Golden Triangle could
also result with the North Side with
its Three Rivers Stadium, Oakland
and Downtown connected with this
transit system.”

In addition, Jonathan Robison,
chairman of the Transportation
Task Force (TTF) of the Pittsburgh

Neighborhood Alliance, supported
the Spine Line plan, stating, “We
badly need a mass transit system
running east and west in this
area."

While favoring the Spine Line-

plan, Robison rejected the Oakland
Crosstown Expressway system
which would provide a by-pass of
the Golden Triangle area for the
North and South Hills.

Robison explained, “The TTF is
against the Crosstown plan be-
cause it would destroy neighbor-

hoods by direct acquisition of land

for the highway and by the impact
of the highway on existing
neighborhoods. '

“It would only encourage more
cars to come into the Oakland area.
It would also wipe out Panther
Hollow and cost an astronomical
sum--about $300 million."

Robin, however, spoke in favor
of the Crosstown system. He said,

Philadelphia and Pittsburgh’s
downtown area."

As a result, the Crosstown plan
would be an important link in the
rapid transportation system, he
said.

“The Oakland Crosstown plan is
really misnamed," Robin pointed
out. “It should really be called a
mid-City Expressway."

Construction of the expressway
probably won't begin until after the
year 2000 but whether the project's
construction date will be moved
ahead or back depends on studies
done on the project and on the
character of the city, state and
federal governments, Robin em-
phasized.

Many community groups such as
the Bellefield Area Citizen’s
Association have already opposed
the Oakland Crosstown.

Appeal at Pitt

Students Drum Interest tor Hungry 

BY GENE GRABOWSKI

In an effort to mobilize student
support for the starving people of
sub-Saharan Africa, the Interna-
tional Student Support Committee
for the Drought Stricken Nations of
Africa (ISSC) arrived on Pitt’s
campus last week. A

The members of ISSC are interns
of the Pan-American Association
whose ranks include noted humor-
ist and social activist Dick Gregory
who is literally running a crusade
against world hunger between
Chicago and Washington, DC.

ISSC members consider them-
selves in a ‘unique position to
participate in emergency efforts
since they have been directly
involved in high-level meetings
with ambassadors of the nations in
the drought area known as the

BY BILL HADUCK _
A security problem affecting the

entire University could result from .

a new campus police practice of
shifting patrolmen to cover for
officers on vacation, charged
several members of the force, who
favor the overtime system used in
the past. However, acting Campus
Police Chief Charles Graham said
no problem exists and overtime
work would be a waste of money.

“lt’s pretty serious,"
Campus Policeman Lee Zaborow-
ski, steward for Teamsters Local
249, the campus police union. ‘‘If
they're short a man, they won't call
anybody else in. They're pulling
men from their beats and sticking
them in to till the gaps. So instead
of two men on a beat you only have

_ one and how many places can one

man cover?"

In the past, the empty posts were
ﬁlled ‘by officers on overtime but
the practice was discontinued
aboutttwo weeks ago when Graham
discovered what he called “a-
buses” in the overtime system.

“Some guys had a system where
they’d work only three days a week
but make more money than if
they’d worked the full ﬁve,”
Graham said.

A number of patrolmen would
take turns failing to show up for
work, he said. They would lose the
days pay but then gain extra salary
in overtime as they replaced others
who would do the same.

The replacement system was
changed over_ to the position
shifting as part of a reorganization
of the entire department, Graham
said. “We’re trying for the

Sahel, and havetaken field trips to
Africa. The ISSC speakers visiting
Pitt are students of universities
throughout the world.

The ISSC's step in Pittsburgh is
part of a tour of selected American
cities to secure help in the form of
food, money, and technical assis-
tance.

Peter McFarren, a spokesman
for the committee, said the people
of the United States have a “moral
responsibility” to help ease the
situation in these starving coun-
tries. \_ ~
“Our immediate goal,” McFar-
ren said. “is to raise funds to send
to the drought afflicted areas." He
added the committee handles none
of the money. Those who wish to
contribute are requested to send

patient care, education in health
related professions and research.“

Cheever believes the need for a
health center will be even greater
in the future because of the
demands of society. “We need a
strong health center to survive in
thee turbulent times with inﬂation
and the demands for effective
health care."

Cheever also ‘reflected on the‘
A institutional changes in universities

resulting from an increasing social
awareness throughout the 24” year
span. “There has; been an
increasing interest on the part of
the faculty and the students in the
governance of the University,”
said~Cheever, “and this increased
participation has been a develop-
ment true in other universities as
well.” ,
This has also effected the
enrollment of students belonging to
minority groups, according to the
Vice-Chancellor. “There has been
a tremendous resurgence of inter-
est in minorty groups in regards to
student and faculty recruitment.

There has been considerable’

recognition that women have
tremendous contribution to educa-
tion, research,,and patient care.”

“There has been a drastic
change in the number of women
enrolled over the years," Cheever
said.

“Thirty-seven women will enter

. the School of Medicine next year

out of 135 places available, which is
better than when I first came here.
There were only seven or eight
then. It’s a startling improvement
and a credit to Dr. Medearis.”
Admitting Pitt has not been as
successful in its recruitment of
black students, Cheever said the
enrollment figures “compare fav-
orably” with those of 24 years ago.
‘‘In the past" commented the
Vice-Chancellor, “the University
has not recognized the ability of
blacks to contribute in the three

Pitt Security

 

areas of education. research, and
patient care. We are not having
as good a year with blacks as
women. but 24 years ago the
University was lucky if one black
was enrolled every other year.

“There have been some startling
and very significant changes over
the years,” continued Cheever,
“and one of the most important is
that there has been a great interest
in the delivery of health care as a

-science that should be studied.”

Cheever will he succeeded by
Nathan J. Stark, a Kansas City
Executive with a background in the
health area. Pitt-officials have said
the selectionof an administrator
reflects an overall trend in
universities throughout the coun-
try.

Cheever noted. “There are some
theoretical disadvantages to having
an administrator in the post of
vice-chancellor. My prejudice is to
have a health related person,
preferrably a physician in the
position, and then have as a first
assistant a capable administrator.

“The converse, though, can
work well also. . But, it" is
encumbent upon the administrator
to have a very accomplished
physician or. health related pro-
fessional who would make a strong
or noncompetitive dean of medi-
cine.”

Cheever is planning to take a
vacation and then return home to
Wellesley, Massachusetts. He has

‘also accepted a part time job at

Harvard University. ,

“I cannot announce the formal
title yet because it has not gone
through the governing board,"
Cheever said, “but I will be
working in the Dean’s Ofﬁce in
admission policies and the me-
chanical processes of admitting and
selecting medical students.

“I’m sorry I’m 65, but I’m going

' back to my home and I’m taking a

very exciting position. It will be a
challenging job, but not full time. I
don’t want to work full time at age
65.”

Cheever also plans to spend
more time developing his favorite
hobby--horticulture. - “Both my
wife and l have strong horticultural
interests. Due to demands on my

never developed these as I would
have liked to do.

“So, I want to have some time
for this hobby. I am the owner of
11 acres of land, and I'm looking
forward to planting trees and
growing things.”

Yet, the Vice-Chancellor regrets
he will not be a part of the many
changes he expects will occur in the
health related areas at Pitt in the
future.

“The future at ‘Pitt is bright,"
Cheever said. “There is remark-
able potential herer I have had a

What we're trying to do is’ get the
most efficient use of the people
without using a whole lot of money.
Overtime uses up a lot of money
and when it isn't needed it just
defeats the purpose of efficiency.”
Zaborowski feels a bit uneasy
about projecting when and where
problems will turn up. “No matter
what post. you let go you don't know
what'll happen. I know they might
be in a pinch with a tight budget
but the ‘University should come
first no matter what the cost is."
Both Graham and Zaborowski
agree that the situation will
eliminate itself at the end of the
vacation season.

“The condition of rising prices is
not an incurable disease as
President'Nixon referred to it in his
speech last week,” Slesinger said
during an interview last week.
“But it is a very serious one.

“A big problem in the nation
today is an unwillingness of

political leaders to recognize what ‘

causes inﬂation. It is not caused by
excessive government spending as
some officials claim,” he said,
“but by a simple scarcity in goods.
“Our government can’t stand it
politically to see a surplus in
goods,” Slesinger noted.‘ “When
the government knew a beef
surplus was coming they bought all
the beef so prices would remain
high. It's best economically to
keep the government out.”
Herbert Stein, Chairman of the
Presidents Council of Economic
Advisors, however, feels the
American people are to blame for
inﬂation. Stein maintains that
“during 1965-68 when a tax

increase was needed to ﬁght’

inﬂation the American people
voted‘ the increase down,
creating a condition.”

_ “lf government officials thought
a tax increasewas necessary,”
Slesinger replied, “they should

thus ‘

have passed it. The people are not
to blame.

“People, however, do worry too
much about inﬂation,” he ad-
imitted. “lnﬂation is like a piece of
sand in your eye. You keep
rubbing it and eventually you
irritate the entire eye. The best
thing to do is get it out and get rid
of it.” ‘ ’

Was President Nixon wise in his
decision to end the "wage-price
controls? _ . _

“.Yes. The wage-price controls

never should have been enacted in *

the first place. The controls upset
our
suffering. Really price controls can
only work if It you have them
permanently,iin’ another type of
economy.

“Curing our inﬂation today will
begin as soon as supply in-
creases," stated Slesinger. “Once
industries pour out more goods
there will be a surplus and prices
will - drop. ' '

WASHINGTON AP--President
Nixon on Tuesday surrendered the
first batch of subpoenaed Water-
gate tapes to US District Judge
John J. Sirica in compliance with
last week’s historic Supreme Court
ruling. 3

But in doing so, a White House
spokesman said, the President will
claim that portions of a few of the
tapes should be withheld from
special prosecutor Leon Jaworski
on grounds of national security or
executive privilege. -

The President's chief defens
lawyer, James D. St. Clair, handed
over to Sirica for judicial review 11
original reels and copies of 17
conversations. St. Clair said the
remaining three conversations due
to be submitted Tuesday already
were in the court's possession.

The tapes include conversations

The Impeachment Articles

(Continued from Page I)

The fourth article of impeach-
ment, the Cambodia proposal,
charged President Nixon “ordered
and ratified the concealment from
the Congress of the facts...of the
scope and nature of American
bombing operations in Cambodia."

Offered by John Conyers (D-M1),
the article was defeated 26-12
after a short debate concerning
presidential war-making power in
the past decade. It was the first
time all 17 Republicans had voted
against an article of impeachment.

The last article of impeachment
which was defeated late last night,
also 26-12, charged that President
Nixon abused federal agencies
such as the IRS for political
reasons, and that he brought
disgrace to the office of the
presidency by his failure to pay a
correct amount of income taxes.

The first two articles of im-
peachment (approved 27-11 and
28-10 respectively) recommending
the removal of President Nixon for
obstructing justice in the Water-
gate case, and his failure to
faithfully execute the nation's laws,
will receive the most support by the
whole House, according to several

_ House aides interviewed yesterday

afternoon.

“This is obvious when the
debates in the committee are
examined," one aide reported.
“The first two‘ articles received
much greater attention."

On Human Decency

Chancellor Wesley Posvar in a written report to Pitt students last fall
iflabeled the Statement of Student Rights and Responsibilities effective
‘September 1, 1973 as representing “a ﬁrm commitment of the
;:University to principles of equity, due process, and limited authority”
"regarding cases of disciplinary action against students- The case of
dismissed mentor, Mike Lessing is a clear example of a commitment
gone sour.

In his second year of service as a mentor Mike Iessing was

  
 
 
  
   
  
  
 
  
  
 
 
  
 
  
 
   
  
 
  
  
 
  
 
 
  
 
   
 
 
 
  

of Orientation Jacqueline ,Mullens the Iessing case is yet another
 of student rights in addition to those guaranteed by federal,
'state and local laws, and as stated in the Introduction to the Student
, Code of Conduct and Judicial Procedures, inherent in the educational
process. '

. . Lessing claimed to be unaware of the speciﬁc complaints levied
against him until last Thursday, and also maintains he has not had
access to the written report of the incident. In fact until last week
‘;'Ie‘ssing said he had been dismissed solely as a result of the orientation
party at Delta Sigma Chi. He has also stated he is unaware of the
' identities of those who made the complaint and has had no opportunity
to ‘challenge their accounts.

. Mullens has unequivocally stated there is no process available for
Lessing to appeal the decision. The decision is ﬁnal according to
~ Mullens because she had informed Alfred Moye, Vice Chancellor of
Student Affairs, of her her decision and he had supported it. However,
i according ‘to Moye the decision can be appealed to the Orientation
_Committee since the decision was made by that committee. Yet, the
decision was made by Mullens alone without any input from the
V,’Orientation Committee. The confusion reflected in these statements is
‘not conducive to resolving'this issue. ,

7 In all  cases students should be informed of the
’ complaints levied against them. They should have the opportunity to
challenge those who initiate the complaints, and most importantly,
they should have the opportunity to appeal the decision. Lessing is no
’ exception. /’ '

" _ The Lessing case is a clear example of the denial of due process in
:: "disciplinary procedures. The question here is not one of legality nor
iejudicial boards available to hear the complaint. The question in this
-‘cease is‘ one of fairness. .

The Chancellor's commitment to Pitt students has been violated. A

..JI3essing’s dismissal are irrelevant, since a student has the basic right to
3 ,be'treated fairly in a disciplinary case, no matter who that student is,
'._ j what her personal habits are, or the nature of the complaints.

' It is, after all, simply an issue of basic human decency.

? principles of equity, due process, or limited authority.- Reasons for_

' Saving children

BY MARY LOU MAHON

"Would you buy cable TV from.
this man?" That's the question
anyone concerned about the
intrinsic value of human life must
answer about Governor Milton
Shapp.

This is the politician,’ who in
October, 1970, stated, “I welcome
this opportunity to set the record
straight on this issue. I am against
abortion. My commitment per-

sonally and as governor is and will

be to the preservation and
protection of all life, and children
not yet born are fully entitled to the
full protection of the state. We
need a sound, unequivocal law in
Pennsylvania to insure this protec-
tion.”

This is the politician who in 1972
vetoed House Bill (HB) 800 which
would have fulﬁlled his “com-
mitment" and this is the politician
who in July of 1974 vetoed The
Abortion Control Act, Senate Bill
(SB) 1318 which would have
extended the “protection of the
state" to at least some of this
state’s “children not yet born."

This same politician, in hislveto
message, claims to have always
been in favor of the strict
regulation of the abortion proce-
dure and has yet to'offer one
solution that amounts to anything
other than a license for abortion on
demand.

rigged Women's Abortion Law
Commission , make hollow, indeed,
his words of 1970.

Both houses of the General
Assembly passed the Abortion
Control Act by overwhelming
majorities. . The governor claimed
that the .legislation “ﬂew in the
face of the Supreme Court ruling”
because it required .the consent of a
spouse or parent, in the case of a
minor, before the abortion pro-
cedure could be undertaken.

One of the fundamental in-
adequacies of that January, 1973
ruling is the fact.that the court
never dealt with the rights of
fathers. despite the fact it was
pointed out to them no woman has
ever been known to become
pregnant of or by herself. ~

People Concerned-for the Un-
born Child has never viewed SB
l3lEl as a satisfactory response to
the horrendous ruling of the US
Supreme Court. We have never
accepted it as anything other than

Two politically orches-'
trated eleventh hour vetoes and a,

interim legislation that would
preserve some lives until the time
when a Human Life Amendment to
the US Constitution is ‘adopted.
There were, however, some very
important aspects of the measure
that should now be in effect.
The bill would have required any

‘woman seeking an abortion to

certify she was doing so with her
own “informed consent.” She
would be required to state she had
been advised there may be
detrimental physical and psycho-
logical effects resulting from the
abortion. There‘ is abundant
documentation that those risks are

‘very real and very substantial.

She would have to be advised,
hopefully, without prejudice, there
are alternatives to abortion, in-
cluding childbirth and adoption.

A father would have been given a
voice in determining the life or
death of his unborn child, and
parents would have had the
opportunity to shield a child still
legally under their protection from
the physical and. psychological
trauma an abortion may produce.

In addition, no court, judge,
executive office, administrative
agency or public employee of the
Commonwealth could require any
person to have or not to have an

' abortion.

Of monumental importance is
the fact SB 1318 would have
protected the lives of children who
had the audacity to survive an
abortion. No longer would they be
left totdie from neglect or by direct
action on the part of the abortion
team. ,

A-premature infant aborted alive
could not be used for‘ any kind of
experimentation except as

. necessary to protect or preserve the

life and health of the infant. Every
medical skill would have to‘ be
employed to preserve the life of a
‘viable fetus, and no abortion could
be performed after viability had
been established except to pre-
serve_the life or health of the
mother.

The Abortion Control Act would
have put an end to the advertising
“peddling” of abortion services
and eliminated the kick-backs to
referral agencies. '

Last month,
Ohio, John Gilligan, signed into
law a bill very similar to SB 1318.
Unlike Governor Shapp, he did not

for their creation.

A review of the judicial procedures is absolutely essential if sanity is
to bepreserved in dealing with disciplinary actions. Mere language
changes being made now by Bowen are inadequate. Alfred Moye,
Vice—Chancellor of Student Affairs, should order a study into the

judicial procedures.

In the meantime Delta Sigma Chi should not be forced to suffer the
injustices of the rationale of the Student Affairs Staff. A review of the

casein mandatory.

We anxiously await with open ears the response of the Student

Affairs Staff.

the. Governor of ‘

Anti-Al)o1'tio11: Illsuring Life

see it as hlS function to-determine
the constitutionality of the legis-
lation. Apparently Governor
Gilligan realized that function
should be left to the courts.

lt is interesting to note that when
a state income tax law was
presented to Governor Shapp,
which was to his liking, he signed it
despite the fact that he was told it
was probably unconstitutional
which in fact it was. Having to
return unconstitutionally collected
revenues was a source of embar-
rassment to his administration.

The Governor recently signed,
the No-Fault Insurance Bill, al-
though his’ Attorney General
announced that its constitutionality
would most likely be challenged.

It is to the everlasting glory of
this Commonwealth that leadership
such as Governor Shapp's was not
apparent when Pennsylvania was
in the forefront of the abolitionist
movement, In 1857, the US
Supreme Court handed down the
infamous Dred Scott decision in
which it declared the black slave a

“non-person" to be disposed of at i

the will of his owner.

The citizens of this state were not
willing to accept this as “the law of
the land" and. although it took
more than one hundred yearsto
undo that injustice, they worked
hard for the constitutional amend-
ment to accomplish that.

Pro-life people likewise refuse to
accept as “the law of the land” the

Court’s 1973 decision that the
unborn child is a “non-person”

and we look to the leadership of the
General Assembly to help undo .

that injustice.

It is not a matter of “imposing
morality" on society. We view it as
a civil rightsvissue to the same
degree that theabolitionists viewed
the Dred Scott decision. No human
being, born or unborn, can be

denied his right to life without due _

process of law. It is as simple as
that. S

If a human being is defined as V

anything other than the new being

which results from the union of’

human ovum and human sperm, if
any conditions are attached as
criterion for that human’s right to
life, then no born human's right t
life is guaranteed. *
The fact that the Governor has

,-turned a deaf ear to the will of the-

people should _ not deter the
legislature from heeding it at their
first opportunity.

Last year, in Pittsburgh, two out
of three pregnancies’ ended in
abortion. The fact that more
unborn children died in the City of

V Pittsburgh than were born can only

bring shame to a city that claims to
be “some place "special". It should
be noted not all of those abortions
were performed on 13-year olds
who were raped.

President John F. Kennedy said,
“children are our greatest natural
resource." The inalienable right to
life for the smallest members of the

human family who are unable to «

speak for themselves, unborn

‘ children, mustube insured. SB 1318

is one step along the way and we
look forward to its implementation.
We are determined to fulﬁll
Shapp's 1970 pro-life “commit-
ment" even if he is no Tonger

,willing.

Trash Fills Local Theatres

BY M. C. PILECKI

The middle of summer, \the
deadest part of the year. is the
traditional time for movie studios to
throw out their garbage; and that's
not an unfair assessment of the
current crop of movies although
i there are a few ringers thrown in

:,7*\_\lVltl1 the losers.

Roman Polanski’s Chinatown was
probably meant to be a mid-
summer sleeper, seeking success
in a low-competitive ﬁeld. True,
when compared to the product

passing for “detective stories”
lately, Chinatown does shine
brightly with a ﬁne performance by
Jack Nicholson, crisp direction and
dreamy photography. But when
you remember the good old days of
The Big Sleep, The Maltese
Falcon, and the films that “made”
the genre, with a myriad of
characters, subplots and spicy
dialogue, well, Chinatown just
doesn’t make it. .

Oddly enough,‘ a flick with
practically no hoopla has succeeded

Sci-Fi Finds Sour Sex

BY KEN MINARIK
Eros In Orbit: Science Fiction
Discovers Sex! J
"Joseph Elder, Editor Pocket Books

. No. 7720 95 cents

Every once in a while a porno book
comes along so atrocious that it

, ,. doesn't even sell well on Liberty

' Avenue. Such will be the case with
Eros in Orbit, a new collection of
science fiction stories about sex
edited by the once respectable
Joseph Elder. ‘

Eros in Orbit contains 10 short
stories, in which relatively un-
known authors attempt to relive
their adolescent fantasies on paper,
with emphasis on the Buck Rodgers
aspects. The result is nothing more
than a boring and listless collection
of bad dreams.

The most interestingiaspect of

,‘Eros in Orbit is the publicity spiel
 ‘found on

the back cover.
According to the editor, Eros in
Orbit is an attempt to seriously
answer the question, “Does sex
have a future?” If one is to believe
these authors, the ' answer is
definitely no. '

Not one of the 10 authors in this
collection has painted a pretty
picture of future sex,‘ Whether by
design or accident, each and every
story envisions no, Eden, but
instead a mating technology and

J‘; sexuality that diminishes the act of

love to "littleimore than nothing.
—«For example, “Lovemaker” by
Gordon Eklund concerns itself with
the identity crisis of a robot
programmed to perform sex on
national television. Further, “In
the Group” by Robert Silverberg is
about sex by telephone hookup. ‘

The book does have one highlight,
though--a hilarious piece of corny
porn entitled “Don Slow and His
Electric Girl Getter" by Thomas
Brand.

Brand paints a hilarious picture of
Don Slow. the boy wonder who sets
out to create a death ray but

future. By the future I mean how
I’m going to make a living once I
leave the hallowed halls of Pitt.

Now with no particular talents
going for me, I continually center
these moments of deep thought on
one thing--how I can get rich quick.

And time and time again, I come
up with one answer. i ‘

You've just got to have a
gimmick.

It doesn't matter what line of
business you're in, if you want to
get something for almost nothing,
you'd better have some sucker
lined up who shows a keen liking
for what you have to offer--your
gimmick.

Take Andy Brown, the last of the

I maskless goalies upon whom the

fate of the Pittsburgh Penguins was
to rely next season.

With three relatively untried
minor leaguers behind him, Andy
became the Pens‘ number one
goalie last winter after Jimmy
Rutherford was dealt to Detroit for
Ron Stackhouse. At that point in
time, Pittsburgh was already
marked as not a threat to make the
playoffs and the elevation of Brown
to the top spot in the nets seemed
deﬁnitely temporary.

Penguin General Manager Jack
Button stayed with Brown through
the rest of the season. calling him
“the number one goalie. if the
Pens have a number one goalie."

 

After Pittsburgh made a belated
run for a playoff spot and rookie
goalie Gary Inness tired at the top
of the stretch, Brown received
more than solid assurance from
Button that he would be the
veteran in camp come September.

Every time I talked to Button
about the goaltending situation and
whether the Pens would make a

‘deal for an experienced netminder

to match their newly improved blue
line corps, he consistently replied
“Why should we?”

And I consistently replied, “Well
I really don't think Andy Brown is
what you call a number one
goalie."

Button would then pull out his
table of statistics and relate the
facts: Brown was playing over .500
since having a new defense in front
of him. his goals against in the last
half of last season was around 2.86
etc.. etc.

- “But do you really think he’s
capable of being a number one
goalie?“

“We'll make a deal for a more
experienced goaltender of the right
deal comes along," Button always
retorted. ‘

Well it doesn't matter now,
because Andy won't be stopping
pucks in Pittsburgh anymore-«that
is unless the newly franchised
Indianapolis Racers of the World
Hockey Association decide to make
an exhibition stop at the Civic
Arena.

CHICAGO AP- George Halas.
the 79-year-old owner of the
Chicago Bears and a founding
fatheriof the National Football
League. blasted Ed"Garvey Tues-
day and said the players‘ strike
would cause as many sweeping

"changes in team rosters as the 1970

walkout.

“When the strike collapses, I
hope Ed Garvey will have it on his
conscience that he caused about
200 veterans to lose their jobs,"
said Halas, referring to the

now the only unsigned Penguin for
next year and the reasons for his
wait have finally been revealed.
He wants a five year contract of
proportions that some of the best
goalies in the NHL have yet to see.
Andy and his lawyer are talking six
figure salaries with five ﬁgure
annual raises and four figure
bonuses for shutouts, one-goal,
two-goal and, believe it or not,
three-goal performances.

For a goalie who has bounced
around with teams like the
Johnstown, Jets and Long Island
Ducks, who has been dealt from
Detroit when their netminding
corps were shaky at best. and who
has but half a season of only fair
play behind a good defense, Brown
is making outrageous demands.

But Andy has a gimmick. It's his
face. ,

Every time Andy Brown skates
into his crease for a game, he’s
taking his life into his hands.
Without a mask [he does wear one
in practice] Brown is 100% more
vulnerable to having his skull split
wide open by a puck that can come
unnoticed from any angle at a
speed of 125 mph.

The Racers can afford to pay for .
gimmicks. They are in a league of
gimmicks and everyone they can
boast will bring the people out to
the gates. and we all know that's
what the game is all about. _

PITTSBURGH AP-—The Pitts-
burgh Penguins said Tuesday they
have signed defenseman Bob
Paradise and goalie Bob Johnson to
multi-year contracts.

The National Hockey" League
club did not disclose terms of the
four-year pact with Paradise or of
Johnson's two-year contract.

 



Conference. , -

“The average NFL club roster of
47 has 11 starters each on offense
and defense and two kicking
specialists," he said.

“That leaves 23 who can be
termed non-starters and they add

"up to 598 on all 26 teams.

“By no means am I disparaging
the non-starter. It’s simply that he
may be just a little more vulnerable
in a job market where his late
arrival gives an ambitious rookie
extra time and attention from the
coaches." .

Halas noted that in the current
strike more than 250 veterans had
reported to camp through Tuesday,
but that “jobs of at least 598 non-
starters from last, season are in
jeopardy." '

In this situation, Halas said,
“the position of Ed Garvey with ‘his
huge, no-cut contract is the
sweetest of all because he stands to
lose nothing except an _ argue-
ment."

already on the track. She gave me

There was a controlled haste
throughout the area, with drivers

what was in process. Cheryl said
that Tom Bakin, our as yet rookie,

moments. Staggering back, I
bumped against another lovely and
discovered that her husband was
out on the track trying to control a
Pinto, which was running fourth at
that moment and about to be
passed by a Datsun. She answered
my questions but didn’t see me.

Moving into Pitt’s team, I saw
that two people were holding
stop-watches and a third person
was printing 1:33.8 on a chalk
board. The conversation was about
the fact that Tom was really making
pretty good time, but would have to
pull out the stops, if he was going
to take King in his Porsche. The
chalk-board man ran out toward the
track and held the board so that
Tom could read it as he passed.
Tom waved an acknowledgement
and shot under the British’Leyland
Bridge getting ready for the
sweeping turn to the right and the
upcoming’ ‘S’ curve.

The -two watches were being
used to clock both Tom's and the
ﬁrst place King's time. Both times-

giving Tom the info necessary to_
tell him what he needed to do to

speed wasn't the only thing needed
to win on the Nelson Ledges Road
Course. You really needed to know
the course and be able to read what
the lead was doing and planning to
do. Was he going into the “S"
curve fast, meaning that he'd have
to come out slow, or was he going
in slow, planning to come out fast?
Predicting that could mean a
possible pass and the lead. There
was‘ no way you could go in fast and
come out fast. So good judgement
was crucial. . '

The next time around Tom had
lost some speed, clocking a 1136.2.
The crew's anxiety built and
conversation took place. The board
printer printed theplast lap’s time

between Tom's and King’s time,

Tom gave a burst and started to
climb over the guardrail. The
heighth is such that when you step
on the lower rail and throw one
leg over the top you find yourself
trying to balance on the edge,
immediately calling for the trans-
ference of the tardy leg. I did just
that. The only trouble was, that my
camera and tape recorder were on
oneside and I was balanced--for a
split second. Have you ever tried

foolish. Getting up, brushing
myself off, and rubbing the back of

about two and a half feet away from

Moving into the Paddock, I

State men agreed with my
evaluation just as an Opel spun-out
on this tight curve. The official
track aids ran out to the car and
checked the driver before they
helped him back onto the track an
his ‘continuation of the race.

Moving over to what appeared to
be a family, I introduced myself
and found out that these people
were indeed a family. They stated
they, lived in Akron and made a
point of driving to Nelson Ledges
whenever they could see a race. I
queried them as to their reasons for
such avid attention. “Excitement”
was the immediate response.
Asking them to define that word, I
was told the competition between a
couple of close racing drivers trying
to out-race each other was what
they really found exciting. Of
course a spin-out did add a little
something, but according to them,
not much.

Her brother Dave was about
twenty-five and stated he had done
some driving in the past and was
working on a formula car. which he
hoped to have ready by next
summer. He expected to have
about $3,000 or $4,000 invested by
the time he had it ready for its first '
race. He told me he had rebuilt a
1600 VW motor and had it in
“perfect‘.' shape. He was very
enamored with the formula cars he
had seen in the paddock and gotten
some good tips from some of the
drivers and mechanics he had
talked to that morning. I wished
him much success with his car and
thanked them for their time.
Working _my way back to the
ﬁnishing line, I stopped at the
collection of antique cars being
readied for their up-coming race.
My eye was attracted to a beautiful
Nash racer of yesterday. The
owner had put it into perfect shape
and expected to win the race when
the time came for yesterday's cars
to show their_stuff. Right next to
this was a 1973 Excaliber, owned
by a Dr. Hammer and having a
lovely blond seated on the back of
the rear seat. A lightening blue
jersey upper and cream jersy skin
tight pants added to her attrac-
tiveness--maybe even taking away
from the Excaliber. Elsa told me

but was an ugly American again
doing his stuff in Europe with his

Thanking Elsa, the added
attraction, I ran to the track in time
to see Tom Bakin finish second,
with a time of] :33.3 for his best lap
as compared to 1:33.} for T. King
Hedinger and his Porsche in first
place. The crew was pleased with
the second but a little disappointed
about not making it a first. Well,
maybe next time.

T. King Hedinger set a new track
record with his 79.034 mph speed.
His face showed the strain of the
race and the suit he wore was
drenched with perspiration. I
followed his car back to his spot in
the paddock and had the following
conversation.

“Say. you're no spring chicken.
How old are you Mr. Hedinger?"

“I'll never see 50 again, you can
bet on that. I’ve been racing for
along time and I don’t believe my
age is showing yet!”

“I'll agree with you, that you
drive like a man significantly
younger. You aren't afraid to put
your foot on the accelerator, even
in those turns and curves."

“Mr. Hedinger, what do you do
when you aren't driving your
Porsche?"

“Well, I work for a living, as
does my wife, and because we

don’t have any children, we don't '

have to save for someone’s college

“Well. one of these days, after
he gets some more experience, he
will beat me. Right now it takes
more than a heavy foot. There's a
good deal of strategy in racing, and
that comes with experience. When
Tom gets that, he'll be hard to

appears to be learning fast. I
expect that if he sticks with it, next

other races."

letting the people who attend these
races know that there’s more to Pitt
than going to class. I think that
more of the. colleges and universi-
ties should have racing teams. This
draws students and heaven knows
colleges and universities need
them. They’re 12% -15% and
maybe a race team will draw a few
kids that wouldn’t have gone if it

weren’t for the team. I think it’s a
great move on their part.” ’

"Thank you very much Mr.
Hedinger. I wish you a lot of
success in the future and hope I'll
see you again."

We shook hands and I walked
back to Pitt's spot in the paddock.

The iced tea was delicious and
the hot dogs took the edge off my
empty stomach.

I‘roamed throughout the paddock
talking to Formiilacar owners sport
car owners, sedan racers, and their
mechanics and friends and dis-
covered those who participate and
attend road racing are a great
group of people. They cover a
broad spectrum of the population in
education, position and income. I
was greatly impressed with the
cooperation between the teams and
saw one team help another many
times. Isaw, exhibited by these
people, a trust not evident in many
other places. Belongings were left
with conﬁdence that when the
owner returned he'd find it where



he had left it. Tools, when neededf‘)

for an emergency, were lent and
returned.

I recommend you take a Sunday
and visit one of the road racing
tracks for at day, of fun and
excitement.

Perhaps you'll see either Tom
Bakin or our other driver, Bob
Fryer win for themselves and Pitt.
