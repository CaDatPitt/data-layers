Natural

Sciences

Course

To Discuss Growth of Ideas

Communications,
Sciences End

Series

By JUDY GOTTERER
(Editor’s Note: This is the last
‘of a. series on the four new
basic courses to be presented
next fall as part of Core Cur-
riculum.)

The Natural Sciences and Com-
munications committees b e g a n
planning and developing their
courses at the beginning of the
present semester.

The Natural Sciences course will
present science as one of the hu-
man activities as it discusses great
scientiﬁc ideas from birth through
growth to the contemporary con-
ception. . .

A study will be presented of the
interaction between science and so-
ciety——values in science and the
social and political environment
in which these scientiﬁc ideas grew
and how the environment contrib-
uted to them.

5 Basic Theor'ies _

Five major scientiﬁc theories or
ideas willform the basis of the
course: A ,

(1) The idea of evolution in bi-

ology and geology

(2) The problem of the solar
system—astronomy, prediction of
eclipses, the revolution of planets
around the sun, and study of fa-
mous men and theiritheories, such
as Galileo’s and Newton’s. A

(3) The - nature of material-
physics and chemistry

(4) A biological problem

(5) A discussion of psychology
with emphasis on the “psychology
of learning.” _

Each of the ﬁve theories will
bestudied in three stages. First,
some basic facts which led to the
develbpment of the theory will
be presented. A study of the
growth of the theory and some
ofits early and its contemporary
’conclusions—both correct and
erroneous—will follow.

Finally, its consequences will be
discussed, including a considera-
tion of its application and possible
future consequences.

The one-year course, of ‘either
three ‘or four credits (to be de-
cided later) will include labora-
tory work, ﬁeld trips, lectures, and
recitation classes.

Minimum of Math

‘ A minimum of mathematics will
be presented and will be applied

. in the study of astronomy physics,

and chemistry.

Members of the planning com-
mittee, headed by Dr. Richard D.

tEdwards, assistaht professor of

mathematics, are Dr. J oost Kiewiet
de Jonge, assistant professor of
astronomy and astronomer; Dr.
Christopher Dean, assistant pro-
fessor of physics; Dr. Ralph Buchs—
baum, professor of zoology; Dr. T.
E. Cartwright, research associate
and instructor in biophysics; Dr.
Harry W. Braun, assistant pro-
fessor of psychology, and Dr. F. C.
MacKnight, assistant professor of
geology. A

, The integrated course in writ-
ing, speaking, reading, and lis-
tening aims to give the student a
"reasonable ‘awareness of lan-
guage as a means of communi-
cation.

The student will receive strict
practice in writing and speaking
with accuracy, clarity, logic and
affectiveness so that he will be
able to hold the attention of in-
telligent readers and listeners. He

will be taught to read attentively
toward the understanding of com-
plex material and to listen at-
tentively for an understanding of
spoken language ofcomplexity.
Skills in English

Practice skills will be aimed at
the control of grammatical and
rhetorical patterns of English sen-
tences——-—written and spoken--—of
the various means of rhetorical or-
ganization in writing and speak-
ing, and of special techniques that
will aid in other University
courses. ,

The four-credit course. will
build on the experience of the
present Freshman English course.

Under the chairmanship of Dr.
Charles R. Crow, associate pro-
fessor of English, members in-
clude Miss Mildred Ann Ditty, as-
sistant professor of speech; Miss
Emily G. Irvine, _associate pro-
fessor of English; Dr. Abe Laufe,
assistant professor of English, and
Dr.‘ Joe M. Ball, associate professor
of speech.

Theeffectiveness of all four
courses will be tested very
thoroughly, according to Dr.
Putnam Jones, associate dean of,
The College and chairman of
th e - ’Humanities Committee.
Amount of knowledge will be
tested before the course begins
and then at its conclusion, to

in understanding the «material
covered in the course.

Results of these tests will be
checked against the results of sim-
ilar ones given to students who did
not take the course.

Experimental pilot sections of
the courses will be instituted next
fall. ‘

_WELL-ROUNDED GROUP—Next fall, The College will insti-i
tute four basic courses in the ﬁelds of communications, humani-
ties, natural sciences, and social sciences. These courses, part
of the new Core Curriculum, were planned in attempt to meet
today’s demand for a well-educated, well-rounded person.

Barrymore, Payne
Star In 232 C1.

The University of Pittsburgh’s
Classic Film Series presents “The
Great Proﬁle,” starring the late
John Barrymore, with John Payne
and Mary Beth Hughes, as its last
attraction of the school season,
Thursday, May 12, at 8:30 p.m. in
232 C1.

The ﬁlm is one of Barrymore’s
best pictures. Playing the role of
an actor, he saves a play from
ﬂopping with riotous ad-libbing,
in the hour-and a-half long show-
ing.

Don Miller, Classic Film Series
chairman, states that any under-
graduate seriously interested in
selecting great ﬁlms to be shown
next year and willing to assist in
running the Series should contact
him at the movie.

Present plan for next semester
is to carry on the ﬁlm program
with reduced subscription rates as
a result of this year’s successful
presentations.

Saturday, May 14, will be
the last day this semester that
veterans will be permitted to
acquire textbooks on a requi-
sition or use their Consumable
Supply Card. These requisi-
tions and cards must be closed
as of that date by the book-
store- ' '

Local Business

0 Q I

Hits High Level

Business in the Pittsburgh dis-
trict last week rose to the highest
level since late September, 1953,"
according to the Bureau of Busi-
ness Research, University of Pitts-
burgh. The most impressive gain
was the volume of trade; indus-

trial production and freight ship- I
ments were up appreciably.’ After

allowance for the usual seasonal
changes, the index of general
business activity advanced to
200.0 per- cent of the 1935-39
average last week; it was 178.9 a
month earlier and 173.2 at the end
of February. Extent of the re-
covery in the past 10 months be-
comes strikingly apparent when
it is remembered that the index
of business in the district tumbled
to 124.5 in the week ended July
3, 1954.

Pittsburgh steel mills operated
at 98.0 per cent of practical capac-
ity last week, down fractionally
from the preceding week; no
change was reported in the num-
bervof active blast furnaces. Bi-
tuminous coal production and
electric power output showed

counter seasonal increases. Freight’

carloadings reached a new high
level in 1955; river tonnage was

‘ about the same as in the week

ended April 23.

 Zoology Professor Buchsbaum
Warns of Radiation in Genes
In Interview About Atom Blast

By JACK OLENDER 6

You might walk away from an
atomic explosion and say, “I feel
‘ﬁne, but do you?”

I Dr. Ralph Buchsbaum, Pro-
fessor of Zoology at the Univers-
ity of Pittsburgh, spoke when in-
terviewed Monday, on the effects
of radiation on human reproduc-
tion. Concerning the bomb tests
the government is conducting in
the southwest, Buchsbaum said,
'“I don’t think that they are par-
ticularly dangerous. The per-
centage of people radiated are
only asmall fraction of the total
population» However, I wouldn’t

British Scientists on the effects of
atomic fallouts from the bomb
tests on human heredity—and a
similar warning by an American
scientist. The undisclosed Ameri-
can said that there are facts the
public is not being told.

To understand the scientists’
warnings, some knowledge of the
theory of radiation is necessary.
Among the particles released dur-
ing a nuclear explosion are some
which are capable of combining
with atoms to produce new com-
pounds; thus the original sub-
stance is made radioactive.

These activated dust particles

like to see them carried out in-
deﬁnately.

“What I am concerned about is
a possible atom bomb war. It
might exterminate the human
race.”

Dr. Buchsbaum based this state-
ment, not only
on the immedi-
ate devastating
effects of bomb
e x p l o s i o n s
themselves, but
on th e long-
term effects of
atomic (or hy-
drogen bomb)

man species.

might settle in an area some dis-
tance from the actual explosion.
They may enter the body either by
inhalation or through the con-
tamination of food. Once inside
the body, they can change the
chemical character of body tissue
and produce radiation sickness.
Death may terminate this con-
dition. Cancer can also be caused
by radiation.

Another, and in the long run
more terrible, possibility is that
the genes in the reproductive
organs may be affected by the
radiation. In such a case, the

'- genes which control traits rang-

ing from hair color to brain de-
velopment are modiﬁed by the
radiation. Maybe the effects of
genetic change are not noticeable

Girl To Be Chosen
As Football Queen

Pitt has been invited to select
an outstanding. young woman to
represent the University at the
Berkeley, Calif. Football Festival.
Ten women selected by the out-
standing American colleges will
participate in the festival which
will take place Sept. 12 to 16.
One girl will be selected as “Miss
Football”, the festival queen.

The Pitt representative’ will
travel to California by plane and
will participate in a three-day
program of festival activities as

guest of the Berkeley Jaycees.

an academic average of C plus or
better in previous college studies.
All special equipment and sup-
plies for the ﬁeld work will be
supplied by the University.

The ﬁeld research will be offer-
ed in two sub-sessions of four
weeks one from July 5 to 30, the
second from August 1 to 27. Stu-
dents will be considered for either
or both of these sub-sessions. Each
will be subdivided into concurrent
g r a d u a t e and undergraduate
courses, Sociology 251 and Socio-
logy 85, Field Research in Anthro-
pology. One unit of credit per week
will be earned, with a maximum of
eight credits for the complete ses-
sion.

Early Hunters Emphasized "

Field work will emphasize study
of the “Early Hunters,” the first
Floridians, who lived primarily by
hunting big game they helped to
make extinct: i. e. mammoths,
mastodons, camels, giant ground-
sloths, and saber-toothed tigers.
These animals and the humans
who depended upon them disap-
peared about 4000 B. C.

Although concentration will
be on Early Man, some time will
be spent in excavating sites of
later shellfish-collecting Indians
as well as a site or two of the
most recent farming Indians.

MT}

cred as part of the site.

Each student will gain practical
experience in locating archaeo-
logical sites, mapping, excavating,
photographing, preserving and
jcatologing of specimens. Equally
limportant and of more general
application, since most of the stu-
dents will not be planning on
careers in anthropology, will be
the opportunity for all students to
participate in every phase of a sig-
nificant scientific project, includ-
ing learning how to formulate a
scientific problem, how to gather
and analyze relevant data, and how
to write up the results of the ﬁeld
research.

Lectures Supplement

To give purpose and direction
to the investigation, supervised
ﬁeld work will be supplemented
by lectures on Indian cultures and
the theory underlying methods
employed in the ﬁeld research.

Those interested in other ﬁelds,
such as botany, zoology, geology,
paleontology, etc., will have an
opportunity to pursue such related
studies during spare time.

Of the nine previous seasons
of archaeological ﬁeld work
which Dr. Edwards has con-
ducted, ﬁve have been concerned
with the problem of learning
about the earliest Floridians.

Yet, evidence for these people
outside Florida is known from
only a handful of campsities. In
Florida, there is, for various rea-
sons, a remarkable abundance of

such siteswith not one, but many

very primitive civilzations repre-
sented.

On last summer’s expedition,
over 50 sites were discovered. Of
these, seven were excavated. Sev-
eral of the Early Man sites found
in Florida are as productive as
any found anywhere else in Am-

Festival Tut: '

Friday’s water battle got Spring Festival off to a hec-

Vtic start that merited attention in all downtown news-

papers and Monday’s ﬂoat parade provided a colorful spec-
tacle for those who decided to use the free time for watch-
ing it. Even students who were busy setting up booths and
show tents on the parade grounds stopped for a few, min-
utes to watch the ﬂoats go by. ’ ~

We suspect that many Pittites who weren’t gathered
on Schenley Plaza during the parade were spending their
time at nearby pubs having ﬂoat parades of their own.
Others were engaged in a rare lpriactice during Festival
Week—-studying. '  . ' *'

‘ Without a doubt, the annual exhibition provides the
best example of mass cooperativeness among undergrads
here so far as extra curricular activity is concerned. The
combined efforts of those who sponsor booths, shows, ﬂoats

“ or race entrants provide Wholesome propaganda for propo-

nents of visible “school spirit.”
Since Friday when tents and booths started going up,
however, class attendance has declined." It is no special

phenomenon this year. It, too, has become tradition.

, ‘ Monday there were so many people out'of class that

many professorswere available to give individual atten-
tion. Most of them are thoroughly disgusted with the pro-
ceedings. But they. are already reconciled to the fact, it
seems, that Spring Carnival will lengthen the average day
for the average student—but none of‘ it spent in class.
, It leads to a lot of confusion. It slows down those who
remain in class, cuts through the curriculum schedule of
the instructor, and certainly affects class participation of
the worker who is especially busy with construction the day
before Carnival begins. ‘ A
A solution might be the complete dismissal of classes

‘the day before Carnival. All those, then, who had a hand

in festivities could pitch in to complete the job quickly
instead of operating in shifts. Those who sincerely want to
continu.e their studies would, on their own,, do a little read-
ing in the midst of mad preparations for Festival. Profes-
sors who wouldn’t mind speaking to just a few students
informally, could replace the hour with voluntary round-
table discussions. . . - . «

Academic-wise and activity-wise this might work out
to beneﬁt _all students. At le_ast no one would feel criminal
for “cutting” classes.

By Cecy Lincoff

Pitt students are fortunate to have within their
grasp the plans for a magniﬁcent student union.
Within the next ﬁve years six million do11ars.will
be put into a huge “L” shaped buildingwhich
will serve as a home for 600 men and women,
and the center of campusfor 15,000 day, evening,
and grad students.

A common meeting place for

«-

tration will be found in the Stu-
dent Union building. Men and
women are working to plan
every detail of the Student Union
for the beneﬁt of the student
body.

Division By Floors?

But after the planning is over,
there is a bigger job to be faced
by the men and women of this ‘University. Will
they function as one body, or -will there be ﬂoors
between them?

Much time,_ eﬁort, and money has gone into
this project so far, and before it is'ﬁnished there
will be much more. It is hoped by many that their
Work will not be in vain, that they will be able to
work_as one group regardless of outside factions.

Dean of Men Theodore W. Biddle has said that
the Student Union will be the meeting place for
city students, dorm students, fraternity, and soror-
ity men and women. The Union will be one place
where they will be stripped of their outside afﬁ1ia-
tions and it is hoped, Work for the student body
as a whole. , ‘ ' —

In a sense, an attempt towards this goal has
been achieved. Six months ago a committee of four
men students, four womep students and two faculty

Co-ec|ucaiiona|?-     .

 

  
 
  
   
  
  
 
       
        

 

members were selected to_ be members of the Stu-’

dent Union Committee.
Men Are The’ Wiser v

The men wisely chose four men who were not
seniors and thus could go on with the project until
at least June of 1956. Unfortunately the women
did not have this foresight and thus named the
presidents of various organizations to the com-

mittee. With the exception of one woman, they‘

are all graduating in June. Therefore three more
women had to be placed on the committee.

The result-’-wasted time. Obviously these wom-
en were not familiar with the previous‘ plans that
their predecessors had made, so the last meeting

‘ of the committee turned out to be nothing more

than a review of six months work and a com-
pletely wasted afternoon.

Granted, the Student Union cannot be built
over night. Theplans were envisioned by Chan-
cellor Fitzgerald when he arrived at Pitt 16 years
ago. Not until this year was he able to realize his
dream for Pitt.

Complete Stagnation
The problem isn’t_completely hopeless as long

as the students are aware of the situation. The "

present Student Union committee is just the ﬁrst
step. It is up to students and faculty to decide

whether the Union will be run by members of

a co-educational institution together, or. as women
doing as they wish and men having to take What’s
given. ‘ '

It is very important to consider this before the_
first bit of ground is broken for the Pitt Student
Union. If the situation is going to be no better.
that it stands now in the Cathedral, then why give
of time,_ money and eﬁort to build nothing but a
larger gap? ’ l

Quality Featured ‘

By Judy Gotterer

Medals and trophies to all those who contribut-
ed their time, talent, and effort to Monday’s Float
Parade. They did a magniﬁcent job!

,But the spirit de corps which produced the
artistic displays was not apparent among the stu-
dent body. Only about one-ﬁfth of the full-time ‘
undergraduate students showed F enough interest
to observe the results of the
many hours of preparation that
went into each display.

An . Aesthetic Challenge *

Each was a masterpiece, a
challenge to the judges’~aesthetic
sense. Theirs must have been a
tough job to choose the. top
three. The students’ achievement
was one of quality, not quan-
tity. The greeks proved the,old- . T
two-head adage‘ with their better-than-ever ﬂoats.

    

Many cry about the amount of money allotted
to building and decorating ﬂoats. But the money
spent for the Monday pageant, was not wasted

when such ﬁne spirit resulted.
Spread Out Parade is
With, so much time spent in preparation,‘the
parade should not be conﬁned to the Schenley
park area. Future‘ planners should prepare-‘for
an intra-city display, for so much effort deserves
more’ than a 15-minute circle around the plaza
before a fraction of the student body. .
Monday’s ﬂoats rated the recognition of the
citizens of Pittsburgh. They could have served

our Pub1ic’Relations Office with a boost for Pitt’s J,

prestige.
Better For Homecoming ‘ _
Despite the fact that the ﬂoat parade’ lends

‘itself to Carnival iWeek, it places a heavy burden

on students when time must be divided among
preparation for booths, practice for shows, and
class examinations. Homecoming would'lend’ it-
self more proﬁtably. Students would have more
time for producing the ﬂoats, and 60,000 specta-
tors to View the pageant before the football game.

Yet, with all obstacles set against them, this

year’s ﬂoat crew hurdled them all and came -

through to do a wonderful job.

Why A Russian Room?

I By Barbara Cherington \

We came to the door marked “Russian Room,”
and the tallest, nicest lookig boy ofthe fourteen
high school visitors said, “C’mon, kids, we don’t
want to see any communist room!” The teacher
of the group bid the tall boy “belquiet and act

,more respectfully” in front of me, their guide

through the Nationality Rooms.
to me for the tall,,boy’s outburst
and instructed her class to en-
ter the Russian room.
Sees Red ,
Each student’s eyes betrayed
anxious curiosity as the group
ﬁled through a beautifully
carved-wood door frame. All
the students stood timidly close
to the walls until the tall boy
stalked across the room and, run-
ning his hands over the imported red velvet seat
covers and drapes, called out, “Look at all this

She apologized

 

red! Just like those red commies! "That’s their
color—red, isn’t it?” He directed his question to
me.

“The colors decorating this,” 'I said, “and the
other Nationality Rooms do not represent politi-
cal factions; but they are used, rather, to complete ‘
the designs of the rooms. This room was designed
to represent a Russian peasant home of before
the eighteenth century.”

Duringmy explanation, I had the attention of
thirteen of the fourteen high schoolers, for the tall
boy kept staring at the bright red curtains. When
I ﬁnished talking, he asked, “And do they really
teach communism in this place?”

I explained, that often the history of the
Russian people is taught in this room. There is
no one speciﬁc course offered bynthe university

‘which deals primarily with the. origin and prac-

tice of communism; but that form of government is A

   

 

studied along with the many other forms of gov-
ernment. C C it A A
Russian Art Alive

I told them that the desire for freedom and

the love of art, music, and literature still live in
the hearts of many Russians, whose culture. is,

reﬂected in this room. I wanted to add that only

less than ten percent of the Russian people are
actually in the communist party, but their teacher
motioned that the group would have to hurry’ in
order to see all the other rooms. \ '

So they ﬁled out through that beautifully

carved-wood doorway. Most of the high schoolers’ _

faces showed wonderment and surprise toward the

artistic ability of the _Russianpeople; and I was‘

glad I had been able to carry over some feeling
thta the Russian Committee in Pittsburgh held
when they organized to build their room at Pitt.-
"Lousy" Commies , . ’

The tall boy was the last one out of the
room. He dragged the end of the ﬁne velvet cur-
tain across the room with him as far as that
material would reach; and he muttered, “Those
lousy reds, ‘with all ther rich materials.” His ‘class-
mates near him heard, and they echoed‘ his words.
I heard mutterings of “reds,” and “commies” until
the group became interested in the next room they-
entered. Their teacher saw my discouraged look
and merely shrugged her shoulders.

This group may or may not be typical of‘

American high school youngsters. But they repre-
sent some proportion of American youth. They
reﬂect the failure of schools that are willing to
condemn Communism but afraid to deﬁne it.

One short speech in a room with bright colors

‘ can’t satisfy the thirsting curiosities of high school

students. It was the job ofthat shrugging teacher
to guide them out of ignorance and unfounded

Biddle Sees Campus

» Joining at New Union

By CECYI

LINCOFF

(Editor’s Note: This is the ﬁfth in a series of articles to acquaint
the student body with plans for the proposed Student Union.)

The proposed Pitt Student Union “is going to change the
character of the University of Pittsburgh” according to Dean
of Men Theodore W. Biddle. It will integrate the upper and
lower campuses and serve as the center for the student

body.

In addition to the Student‘ Union building, a men’s dor-
mitory will be constructed to house approximately 300 men.

These men will have living andé .

. lounging facilities available in the

dorm, but will eat meals in the
Union which will be adjoined to
the living quarters.
Men’s Dorm First .
It is hoped by the dean that the
dormitory and 40 per cent of the
Union building will be completed
by September, 1957.
I Then work on the other 60
per cent of the Student Union
and the women’s living center
will begin.

.DEAN T. W. BIDDLE .
Student Union Plans, forming

 

No definite plans as to interior
or exterior architecture have been
made according to the dean. How-
ever the property has been bought
and" it is only a matter of time
until the ground is broken.

The men’s dorm will face Rus-
kin Ave. behind the new Clapp
Hall. The Student Union will ex-
tend in an “L” shape from the
dorm with an entrance on Bige-

~.low Blvd. When the building is

completed it will extend over
Tennyson, and Lytton Sts.
Center of Campus

Property for the women’s dorm
and the rest of the Union is in the
process being negotiated.

When the entire project is
completed the Student Union
will be the center of the Univer-
sity and ‘will s e r v e dormitory
students, city students, and those
living in fraternity houses.

This plan of making the Union
the nucleus is a new concept in
building. Student Unions on most
campuses are situated from four
to six‘ blocks away from the main
campus area. 1’ . ‘

Pitt a “First”

Pitt is the first school of its
type in the country to attempt to
build a student union. “No insti-
tution of our type has had the
courage, foresight, or funds to
undertake such a project,” said
Dean Biddle.

began many years ago when
Chancelor Rufus H. Fitzgerald
came here from Iowa. He had
been instrumental there in plan-
ning and seeing the first third
of a student building built. Up-
on coming to Pitt, the Chan-
cellor always felt that a student
union could transform a student
body.

Funds for the Chancellor’s pro-

Vject were acquired from the trus-

tees. The location was decided up-
on and physical possession of the

' property will be taken soon. Tem-

porary blueprints were drawn and

i a student-faculty committee was

set up to discuss permanent plans
with regard to architecture, facil-
ities, furnishings, and organization.
Students Assist
Many months ago two members
of Student Congress, Men’s Coun-
cil, and WSGA were selected for
the committee along . with one

Sophomore and junior men were
chosen so that they could follow
the plans throughout their senior
year. However the women appoint-
ed presidents of various organiza-
tions. 1

the spring one half of the com-
mittee had to be revamped._

Dean Biddle and Dean of ‘Wom-
en Helen P. Rush are the faculty
members.‘
Many suggestions for facilities
have been drawn from other
schools and from the needs of the
Pitt students.
Rooms for a photo lab, arts
‘ and crafts, hobbies, typing,
drama, publications, ping pong,
music, chess, band practice,
dancing, television, and loung-
ing are all in the planning stage.

Although the dean stressed that
no decision has been made, it is
expected that the architecture will
be in harmony with the Gothic
Cathedral, Chapel, and Foster
Memorial. However, Dean Biddle
made it clear that the “interior of
the building need have no bear-
ing on the exterior.”

Six Stories of
City ‘Portraits’

Elizabeth Moorhead Vermocken,
90 year old author, whose family.
tree is rooted deep in the Pitts-
burgh area, has written another
book, “Pittsburgh Portraits”, to
be published May 16 by the Box-
wood Press.

Miss Moorhead, whose grand-
father was the ﬁrst classics Pro-
fessor at Pitt in the 1820’s, taught
English for 18 years at Carnegie
Tech. Among her other works is
the co-authorship of the book
“These Too Were Here,” published
by the University of Pittsburgh
Press. She wrote portraits of
Willa Cather and Louise Homer in
that book. 1

“Pittsburgh Portraits” contains
ﬁve additional descriptive stories
on men and women who have
been prominent on the Pittsburgh
fine arts scene.

One of these personalities is Dr.
John A. Brashear, noted amateur
astronomer and one time acting
chancellor of? the University of
Pittsburgh from 1901-1904. Born

THE GREAT CAP and.GOWN CONTROITERSY

The cap and gown season is upon us, and with it comes the
perennial question: which side of the cap should the tassel
hang on‘?

This is an argument that arises every year to roil the aca-

demic world, and it is, alas, no closer to solution today than it
was in 1604 when Fred Tassel invented the troublesome orna-
ment. - ' -

Fred Tassel, incidentally, never made a penny from his inven-
tion. The sad fact is he never took out a patent on it. This tragic
oversight becomes understandable, however, when one considers
that patents were not invented till 1851 by Fred Patent, himself
a pitiable ﬁgure. A compulsive handwasher, he died in his four-

. teenth year, leaving behind a wife and ﬁve spotless children.

But I digress. We were discussing which side» of the cap the
tassel should hang on. ~ .

For many years the universally accepted practice was to hang
the tassel over the front of the cap. This practice was abandoned
in 1942 when the entire graduating class of Northwestern Uni-
versity, blinded by tassels hanging in their eyes, made a wrong
turn during commencement exercises and ended up at the Great

‘Lakes Training Centeriwhere, all unwitting, they were inducted

into the Navy for ﬁve year hitches.

There is one school of thought—1arge and growing daily larger
-—which'.holds that the tassel should be worn on the same side
you carry your Philip Morris cigarettes. Thus a quick glance
will show you where your Philip Morris are and save much time
and fumbling. " '

This makes a good deal of sense because when one wants a
Philip Morris, one wants one with a minimum of delay. One does
not relish being kept, even for a second, from theclean, delicate
ﬂavor of Philip Morris, so artfully blended, so subtly concocted
to please the keen and alert taste buds of young smokers. One
chafes at any obstacle, however small, that is put -in the way of

enjoying this most edifying of cigarettes, so pleasing to the

perceptive palate. Here, in king size or regular, at prices that
do no violence to the slimmest of budgets, is a ﬁrm white cylinder
of balm and pure, abiding content.

There is another group, small but vocal,—that insists the tassel
should hang over the back of the cap. -The tassel, they say, is a
symbol like the bu11ﬁghter’s pigtail, signifying honor, and
courage; 

They are wrong. Bullﬁghters wear pigtails for only one rea-
son: to keep the backs of their necks warm. Do you have any
idea what a draft a bull makes when he rushes past you? A
plenty big one, you may be sure. -

In fact, upper respiratory infections, contracted in the wake of I

passing bulls, are the largest single cause of bullring fatalities.
I have this interesting. statistic from the Bullﬁghters Mutual
Life Insurance Company of Hartford, Connecticut, one of the
few insurance companies in Hartford, Connecticut, which writes
insurance exclusively for bullﬁghters. Incidentally, Hartford,
the insurance capital of America, is a most interesting city and
well worth a visit if you are ever in New England, as north-
eastern United States is, for some reason, called. Hartford can
be reached by bus, train, plane, and the Humboldt Current. Try
to make your visit in spring, when the actuaries are in bloom.

But I digress. We were talking about What side ‘to Wear the I

tassel on. An ingenious solution to this troubling problem was
proposed a few years ago by Fred Sigafoos,.perhaps better known
as “The Quoit King of Delaware.” An early forbear of Mr.
Sigafoos, Humboldt Sigafoos «(who later inventedthe current
which bears his name) was granted a monopoly by King George
III on all quoits manufactured in Delaware. Somehow the royal
appointment was never rescinded and from that day to this,
every quoit made in Delaware has been a Sigafoos Quoit.

Well, sir, Fred Sigafoos once suggestedthat an equitable
settlement to the great tassel. controversy would be to starch
the tassels so they stood upright and hung on no side ofthe cap
at all. Mr. Sigafoos was, of course, only seeking to broaden his
market, because after graduation, What can you do with an

upright tassel but hurl quoits at it?
©Max Shulman, 1955

The makers of PHILIP MORRIS who bring you this column inake no
recommendation about what side to hang the tassel on. But with
cigarettes they say: Stay on the gentle, tasty, vintage side-with
PHILIP MORRIS, of course. ‘

With their ﬁve-game win streak halted abruptly by Fri-

attempt to start another victory skein at the expense of
Washington & Jefferson this afternoon at the_Shannopin

Although the locals swamped the

He also earned four points, the
maximum attainable under the
Ohioans’ scoring system, to lead
in that department. Rounding out

% Judo Club Begins

With Exhibition

A new activity may hit the
scene at Pitt within a very short
time with a movement under way
ito start a judo club.vAs a kickoff
Eto this potential new activity,
, there will be a judo demonstration
fat the Cathedral Gym, 4:30 p.m.,
Tuesday, May 17.

The demonstration will be put
on by students Kiril Graf, Ken
Miller, and Mike Cerrata.

Intramural Director Leo Bemis,
who will be in charge of the eﬁort
to form a judo club stated, “There
is a movement within colleges
to introduce judo as an activity.”
He also added that the enthusiasm
is high at present but the leader-
ship and interest must come from
the students. He urges anyone
interested to attend the exhibition
next Tuesday.

Bemis was careful to distinguish
between judo and ju-jitsu indi-
cating that judo is played under
a set of rules and regulations
whereas ju-jitsu is pretty much a
“the man without the broken arm
wins” sort of game.

Mitters Opose Lions
After Disastrous Tour

By AL PELAEZ i

Battered but still game after last week’s disastrous road
trip, the Panther mitters take to the road again‘Friday and
Saturday for a two-game series with Penn State’s Lions.»

State has a 7-3 mark for the season and promises to be
extremely troublesome for Coach Bobby Lewis’ road-weary
baseballers. They will undoubtedly pitch Ed Drapcho, who
has captured ﬁve of their seven wins, against the Blue and

ith Irish ‘

Gold in one of the games. 6
Before last week-epd’s excur-
sion, the locals were only one
game under the .500 percentage
mark with ﬁve wins against six
defeats. A combination of loose
defensive play and sub—standard
pitching put that goal out of
reach, at least temporarily.

Cornell ended a three game
Panther win streak in the ﬁrst
game with a 10-7 win. Don Miller
and Carl Lindstrom did the pitch-
ing for the locals. The Blue and
Gold jumped oﬁ to a three run
lead in the ﬁrst inning but then
fell apart defensively, committing
eight errors. The only bright spot
for the Panthers was the hitting
of Big Bill Schmidt who had two
triples.

After bowing to the Big Red
the Lewismen entrained for Syra-

cuse where Ronnie Moog dropped
a 6-4 decision. Moog pitched good
ball but the locals gave the game
away as they committed error after
error. The Panthers almost pulled
the game out in the ninth inning
but their rally fell two runs short.

The third loss was to Juniata,
who squeezed out an 8-7 win

“over the locals. Al Payne," third

Panther pitcher of theafternoon
picked up the loss in his first
appearance of the season.

The Panthers -lost more , than
three ball games, however. They
also lost the services of two of
their better players Harry Lit-
tle and Jim Masur, who were hurt
and may be out of action for the
next few games.

Well, most likely the teacher will think a moment, tilt his head

only the man who shed them can tell the difference.

Booters Complete Spring Drills
With Eye On Rough Schedule

. ready to write ﬁnish to spring drills———the soccer team.

Coach Leo Bemis’ kickers will wind things up this Sunday

afternoon with an exhibition

‘Bemis stated that the kickers

. have been concentrating mainly on

fundamentals during the workouts
and haven’t done any scrimmag-
ing. With a glance at next year’s
schedule, it’s easy to see why the
soccer mentor has been working
hard on fundamentals.

In addition to the eight teams
which appeared on the soccermen’s
schedule’ last year, next season’s
card shows four big additions——
Duke, North Carolina State, Navy,
and Penn State. -

The Lions from Penn State were
the number one college team in

V the country last year and placed

two men on the All-American
first team and "two more on the
second eleven.

To help equal last season’s rec-
ord of eight wins as against only
one loss, Bemis has a host of let-
termen returnng to the squad. The
veteran’s contingent is led by Big
Mike Culhane, who was the defen-
sive bulwark last year besides be-
ing second leading scorer.

Other returning letter-winners
include linemen Ed Armstrong,

returning halfbacks are Bob His-

Hughes Likes His Job

A

By MIKE BAER

Being the number one man on a
varsity tennis squad is ‘no bed of
roses and the ﬁrst man who will
admit this is the number one
Panther netster, Pat Hughes—-
but he likes it. ,

Called on to meet the top
server the opponant’s have to offer
in each match, Hughes can be sure
of rough competition every time
he swps out on the tennis court.
Some‘ small schools have only one
really good netster while the rest
of their squads are composed of
mediocre players. It’s Hughes who
has to meet the opposing teams’
ace.

Recently tapped to Omicron

Delta Kappa, the six foot, 150-
pound Sigma Chi man started his

_tennis playing at Latrobe High

School. Hughes teacher at Latrobe
was coach George Rise, who intro-
duced Pat to the game of tennis.
At Latrobe Hughes went to the
finals of the WPIAL tournament
and led his team to the WPIAL
team championship.

_ His ﬁrst varsity year at Sky-
scraper U. saw Hughes elevated
to the number one position almost
immediately. Pat compiled six
wins and ﬁve losses against top
competition last season as. a
sophomore.

So far this year Hughes’ record
is even at four wins and four de-
feats. Pat says his toughest
matches of the season came at the
hands of Al Griifeths of West
Virginia. In their first encounter
in Morgantown Hughes won the
ﬁrst set 6-4, only to be set back
6-3 and 7-5. in the next two sets.

When the boys met for the
second time at Mellon Park the
result was even more of a heart-
breaker for Pat. Once again he
took the ﬁrst set 6-4 and the
second set went to 22 games be-
fore Griffeths won,12-1'0. The
West Virginia netster then went
on to take the third set, 7-5, to
cop the match.

In the doubles Hughes’ partner
is team Captain John DeCoux-
who has been Pat’s partner_ for

netsters travel east to meet Frank-

Both Eastern opponants, par-

the success they have enjoyed

DuPont Veep

Praises ‘Core’

Henry du Pont, a vice president
of the Du Pont Company, ad-
dressed a dinner meetingof en-
gineering professors who were on
a two-day tour of the company.

Mr. du Pont explained that en-

gineers should take the lead in -

creating understanding of tech-

» nology if the problem of its ad-

vances are to be solved. “We must

explain; we must teach the real
facts; we must become missionar-
‘ies, so to speak, carrying the mes-
sage and the promise of tech-
nology to all people,” he declared.

‘He said that the university is
the key element in the under-

standing of advancing technology _

“because engineers need broader
knowledge on the liberal arts side

of the campus, while those in‘
social sciences ‘ and cultural ﬁelds

need to understand problems and
results of technology, and the na-
tion’s industrial growth.

He also pointed out that there 5

is a need for leadership with the
’ capacity to promote conﬁdence
and understanding. The engineer
has “special qualiﬁcations to offer”

as a leader because he has been

trained “to infer logically from
premises, to distinguish the fact
’from the guess,” Mr.
added. “We need leaders with
common sense and cold logic,
leaders with the intellectual hon-
esty to face facts.” 2

Safe Salk Vaecine Responsibility

‘Is Now in Govérnmenfsﬂy Hands

The United States Public Health
Service is trying to do all it can
“to assure the continuous ﬂow of
.safe vaccine”, said Dr. Jones E.
‘Salk. He stated that the _vac'cine
}has “gone beyond the research
‘.stage” and it’s now the govern-
lment’s responsibility to see that
ithe vaccine is made right.
I .‘The U.S. Public Health Serv-
ice’s decision to re—check all vac--
icine expresses its desire to do all
in its power to assure the con-
tinuous ﬂow of safe and effective
vaccine,” Dr. Salk: said in a pre-
pared statement.

“The U.S. Public Health Service
has the ultimate responsibilityin
matters of this kind that have
gone beyond the research stage.”

Meanwhile, the delay may re-
sult in some of the local ﬁrst and
second graders returning for their
second doses of vaccine after sum-
mer vacation has begun.

Dr. Hart E. Van Riper, medical
director of the National Founda-
tion for Infantile Paralysis, said
he doesn’t know if and when any
more vaccine will be available for
the ‘free shot program. Delay and
uncertainty are due to the fact
that the foundation doesn’t know
how long federal inspections are
going to take.“

Because of a supply hitch, the
State was forced to "move the
second round of shots back from
May 16 to 23.

Dr. Van Ripper ‘announced that

of Chesterfield’s smoothness——-
mildness—refreshing taste.

iYou’ll SMILE your approval

actual production of vaccine was
halted by all manufacturers April
30, and will not be resumed again
until the government announces
whether or not it is going to
change the rules for making and
testing it.

Thomas Millington, director of
preventive service for the State
Health Department, said he’s go-
ing ahead with plans to resume
shots May 23 because he has had

no word that a further delay is‘

prospective. However, even if pro-

ductionis resumed on the twenty- ,

third, a severe shortage of vaccine
is expected to crop up in late July

or August, about the time vaccine,

which should be entering the pro-
duction pipeline would now reach
the market.

The reason for the re—checking
of all vaccines is an outgrowth of
what U.S. Surgeon General Leon-
ard A. ‘Scheele called “unfortunate
occurrences in California and
Idaho”, where a number of young-
sters came down with polio short-

ly after receiving shots of -vaccine.

made by Cutter Laboratories of
Berkeley, Calif.

Dr. Scheele stated that nobody L

knows whether or not the Cutter-
made vaccine caused the disease.
But, he said, “the association” be-

‘ tween the shots and the 44 cases

of polio which have occurred in
the Cutter-inoculated youngsters
is “so deﬁnite” that its product
won’t be released until it has been
fully re-tested. — A E
