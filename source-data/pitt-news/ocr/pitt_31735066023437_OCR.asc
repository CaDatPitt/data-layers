son, candidates for Student Gov-
ernment Board president believe
an investigation should be con-
ducted into any alleged wrong-
doings connected with Jeff Miller’s
quest for a position on the
presidential ballot.

Miller, who lost his ﬁght to gain
a position on the ballot because of a
failure to meet the grade point

average requirement also charged ‘

that someone gained access to his
transcript illegally through the
registrar’s office prior to the
_deadline for submission to the

elections committee..

“Knowing Jeff personally, I can
sympathize with the fact ' that he
wanted to run for’ the position, but
there is nothing more to say since
the Judicial Board ruling on
Friday.” Abraham said. “If there
are even any perceptions of any
wrongdoing in Student Govern-
ment Board they should be
investigated and ' dealt . with
appropriately.” A '

Abraham and Watterson differed
on their views of funding the
proposed student union renovation
project.

“The administration should.
make it their aim to increase the
capital funds campaign and fund
the majority of the project from
that,” Abraham said.

‘‘I think there should be a

completed,” Watterson said. “I
don’t want to see the cost of this

“It also provides black students.

areas-culture, education, politics,.

  Write-In President   

By RODNEY B. GRIFFITH

Pitt News Staff Writer -
Jeff Miller, the chairman of the

Student Government Public and »

Government Relations Committee,
yesterday said he planned to the a

write-in candidate for SGB Presi-_

dent « and to pursue possible
violations of his right to privacy,

despite a Judiciary opinion that

supported the’ decision to deny

‘Miller a place on the ballot.

“I am going to make my attempt
as a write-in. Some of my friends
have been getting my cards and
posters out,“ Miller said. “My
slogan is ‘my time is write’ and I
hope to be the first write-in in SGB
president of the University of
Pittsburgh. ’ ’

Miller added that next week he

'ﬁrst would try to have the election
cancelled and have new elections
held later. '
’ “I think the election should be
cancelled and the process started
again, but in case that doesn’t
happen, I’m going to pursue this
write-in campaign,” he said.

The SGB Judiciary voted 6-0-1 on
Friday to let stand the decision of
the SGB Elections Committee,
which «found that Miller‘ did not
have the 2.5 QPA needed by
presidential candidates and could
not be a candidate. If Miller runs a

write-in campaign, he must submit .

a transcript showing him to have a
2.5 QPA and justify why he should
be allowed to be a candidate 48
hours before polling begins Mon-
day, Nov. 12.

“We feel the Elections Commit-
tee rationale for decision to be a
fair rationale for the decision,”
Steve Fendler, chairman of the
Judiciary, said when he announced
the decision on Miller’s appeal of
the election Committee decision.

JOE
BLAZER

Blazer, a junior, said there are
alot of complaints about the lack of
major concerts at the university.
The reason for the lack of concert
programming. he said, is due to the
competition with major concert
promoters. I

A solution to the problem is for
the Pitt Union Program Council to
develop a better relationship with
city promoters in order ‘to “have
something special for Pitt stu-
ems" (organizing a concert for Pitt
students). -

Blazer said the allocation of the
student activities fee should be
consistent and based on whether a
particular group is sponsoring a

ALTER
BURKE

“Lets get organized,” Burke’s
campaign slogan, means a little
more than improving communica-
tion between students and the
Student Government Board. It also
means that the allocations process

“dollar spent should be returndd

_ ‘by a dollar worth of goods,” Burke

said.

Examples of good investments of '

areas. of consumer protection (the
Legal Awareness Committee) and
programmingkaccording to Burke.
To assist the Allocations Com-
mittee in its job of funding student
groups, each group should sumit a
list of goals it expects to accomplsih
in the coming year, Burke said.
“This will help us‘ see if what
they (the organizations) said is
what they stuck to,’«’ Burke said.
~.If’an organization performs well
in the past, then the allocations

Burke -said the SGB should be
the focal point for students. The
board should be assertive when
dealing with the university admini-

the Student Union.

‘ ‘When the Student Union ﬁnally
is renovated I would like to see
places where commuter students
can go to. study or just -to relax

commuter students to go to relax,

Calaluca does back action to.

Germain also said he would like

raised. \ _
_. “Right now the board is lacking
integrity, or I might say it has been
kind of tainted,” Germain said.

,“.Right now it is, not functioning

In light of the plans to renovate

“What we need is one place

“Many students are tops in their

like me to understand them they
shouldn’t be teaching,” Hendler
Said. r ’

Hendler also said he would like

“The image of student govern-
ment is tht many, students don’t
take it ‘seriously...there is no
rapport between the students and

take it seriously and I certainly,
don’t consider it afarce. I think
students would feelthe same way if
they only took the initiative to ﬁnd
out.” . .  -

\

On the subject of student union
renovations, Hendler would like to
see improved recreation room,
coffee shop with later ‘hours and
larger offices for student organ-
izations, should be included.

Hendler believed commuters
should be heavily considered when
renovating the existing Schenley

ALAN
AAELE

Mele, a junior economics and '
political science major, - said that
Student Government. Board can
only be effective if its members are

active and enthusiastic.
The student activities fee should
be raised from $12 to $15 per teriii

because of inﬂation and a decrease ‘

in Pitt's enrollment, according to
Mele. Currently, the allocation of
the fee is not equitable because
funds are not distributed to
organization in line with the
student to dollar ratio.

Mele said. the Student Govern-
ment Commuter Affairs Committee
needs to be strengthened tobetter
represent the commuter popula-
tion. The gap between commuters
and resident students needs to be
narrowed because “the school
needs to be pulled togetheragain. ’ ’

‘The student'- union renovation

project, according to Mele, should .

include provisions for a bar and a
all-night study facility. ‘Funds for
‘the project should come from the
University's capital campaign and
from the state“ government.

“We must "show Thomburgh we
are a threat,” Mele said. “We
\should transport students en-mass
to the capital;”. ' .

As a member of the "Legal

nessed ‘many instances of_ poor
treatment of students by their
landlords. In_ order to’ help
students with these types of

problems, the committee should be

Palowitch,‘ a junior _chemical

student liasozls can work closer

difficulties confronting them.
“There are 15-18 organizations
assigned to each committee liason.

Without close contact between the
‘ liason and the group there are alot .

of unneccesary problems,” Palo-
witch said. “With this change,
money,‘ would be better spent,
unused supplies could be returned
and redistributed making for better
management and control overall.”
- Palowitch has been an alternate
member of the Allocations Commit-'
tee during the past year. '
Palowitch proposed to end~long

reccomending an on-line registra- .

tion process, which the student’s
advisor would key the students

“I think what one thing that has

  School

Board
Vote  

The response of the Pittsburgh City School Board
to desegregation has been to avoid the subject,
especially in public meetings. Since 1968 the board
has contested desgregation suits in the courts and
consequently shrouded many of the deliberations on
the matter by claiming discussions included
consultation with attorneys, which did not have to be
public according to Pennsylvania's sunshine laws.

One candidate for the school_board seat representing ‘

Oakland, David Engel, a professor of education at
Pitt, offers .a more refreshing view of the
problem—recognizing that integration is inevitable
and attempting to overcome the fears of
Pittsburghers about desegregation.

Expression ‘of such views by any board candidate
in a city of neighborhoods where each is dominated
by parochial ethnic groups is a brave act, but it is the

only realistic one, considering the Nov. 7 deadline for —

submission of a desgregation’ «plan to the
Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission. With
this date haunting the school board, it would seem
the group would need as many progressive thinking
members as possible, who realize the need for
desegregation and are willing to lead the school
system to that end.

Engel more than adequately realizes the need for
progressive views on desegregation and‘ the special
problems the board must face to implement these
views. First, the professorrecognizes that any plan
would require mandatory busing, and that the real

necessity is to keep it to a minimum and to make sure ,

all groups equally share the inconvenience of a bus
trip to school. - -

“The question is how to minimize busing so that it
does not become the burden of any one group,” said
Engel is an interview last week. “We have a lot of

voluntary one-way busing of blacks into what have
been essentially white schools. They have bus rides
of one-half to one hour.” '

More importantly, Engel foresees the possibility of
violence over desegregation unless the school board
takes the initiative and completes an integration plan
soon. This potential for violence might .be increased

’ if the board fails to submit some plan to the human

relations commission by Wednesday. Then, the
court might declare the board to be in contempt,
demand immediate adoption of a plan or appoint an

- individual to complete a proposal, and the resulting
publicity could make tensions over the question‘

greater. But, election of members like Engel could
forestall such court. action if the human relations
commission saw the chance for change.

“Unless we get some leaders that take a stand, we
are hurting the whole school system,” Engel
commented on this problem, adding, “I’ve learned
an interesting thing. Both white and black parents
are fearful. But, this makes a common human
factor—we can learn to live together.
necessary.” g ,

Engel’s experience as a professional educator adds
to his appeal. He has studied the successful
desegregation of Minneapolis, Minnesota schools
and other crucial topics in‘ education besides
integration. Such expertise could only enhance his
ability‘, to represent the part of the city including
Shadyside, Oakland, Greenfield and part of Squirrel
Hill. The combination of a strong stance for
integration with professional expertise certainly
makes Engel the best candidate in the board race.

I think it is -

We fully endorse Engel for these reasons, and urge ‘

student, faculty and staff who live in Engel’s distrct
to vote for him tomorrow. ‘

Knowing the Tricks-of the Trade in Order to Enroll in Classes

When I graduate in April. I. like
every other student who passes
through this univeristy. will be an
expert on the games departments

-‘play to trick students into their
_ classes.

The first I learned as a
freshperson was the “prerequisite
trick." Students are not allowed to
take any of the interesting courses
until they have taken the depart-
mental introductory courses. This
seems logical because a certain
block of knowledge may be
assumed for some courses. But
.more often it is the case that
departments merely want to
increase their enrollments. Higher
enrollments mean more money.
And of course. that is the
University's greatest concern.
money. Is this any excuse to pack
300 students in a classroom behind
a television screen? Or. as in the
math department where they are
saving lots of money by having
undergraduates teach. Thus. en-

rollments are just as high. but’ a
large teaching staff need not be
maintained. This is by no means a
criticism of the undergraduates
who are teaching. but rather a
comment on the fact that they are
not paid as much as they are
worth. _

The second trick is the “major
requirements trick." If students
are required to take certain
courses. departments that can
attract enough majors are guaran-
teed high enrollments. This prac-
tice presumes that each person
majoring in a certain department
has the same needs or. that each
person should get a well-rounded
education. Doesn't that place a lot
of power in the hands of the people
who are to decide what well-
rounded is?

Another trick is the “juicy name
trick." Professors often assume

that if they give their course a good.

name it will attract lots of students.
The trick I despise the most is

 

the “don't let them know who's
teaching the course trick." The
Spanish department is especially
good at this trick. For the past
three years I have been trying to
find out who teaches courses in that
department before I register. I
have ‘called the department a
month before. a week before. and
once even a day before a’class was
to be held. still the department was
unsure of who would teach the
course. How well prepared to teach
a course can an instructor be if s/he
is not informed in advance what
s/he will be teaching? A perceptive
person once pointed out to me that
those are evidently the lousy
courses that no one wants to teach.
In any case it makes more work for
the student who has to sit ‘in on a
class to find out who is teaching
and what the course is all about. I-
is possible to add/drop. but a
student might alreadyhave missed
one or two-classes from having vo
sit in on classes that could.h.avc

been eliminated immediately by
talking I" the instructor before the

students. and of course the
students who are paying a whole lot

class. Who gets the grief for these of money to deal with these
tricks? Often advisers who are just ‘hassles.

Pitt News Staff Writer.
Before most Pitt football fans

could get settled in their seats

Saturday, defensive back Terry
White made the game-winning
play in the Panthers’ 28-21 victory
over Syracuse.

With only 2:56 gone in the first
quarter, White took John White's
punt on the Pitt 15-yard line and
returned it 85 yards for a
touchdown. Not only was this the
longest punt return of the season
and second longest in Pitt history,

- but A the seven points were the

difference between a win and a tie
or "loss.

“I'm glad to get that one over,”
said Pitt coach Jackie Sherrill
“We made
more mistakes today than we have
all season. We made an awful lot
of mistakes on defense.”

Sherrill was also unhappy with

‘the pass protection. ‘‘It (the pass
‘ protection) broke down two or three

times,” he said. “I think it was

 ' , u just that we sat back waiting and

  
  

 

‘\

 

gave them too much cushion. -.

After the Orange recovered from
the initial shock of the punt return,
they began getting their own game
together, pushing Pitt all over the

v ﬁeld, and taking up large chunks of

time. Syracuse held the ball for
more than 12 minutes in the first
quarter and for more than 34
minutes in the game.

but was taken down by Rickey

On the first play of the second
quarter, the Orange’s Joe Morris
was jolted by linebacker Steve

Terry White.

The Panthers then began to
mount a significant drive that

far’ as the Syracuse 17-yard line.

But with a second and 20 from the

Marino threw his only interception
of the day, a pass picked off by
Warren Harvey at the two-yard
line. .

According to Sherrill, . Marino

called the right play, but threw thefts: ‘

“Dan executed well today, but
he had a lot more pressure on him

this week,” said Sherrill of the‘

freshman making his first colle-

giate start. Marino completed 18 of ‘

26 passes for 170 yards and two
-touchdowns.

With Syracuse in possession on
its own 33 and Hurley running,
JoJo Heath tackled the signal-

Hurley will never again set foot in Pitt Stadium as a
player. The senior Syracuse quarterback—who
seems to save his finest performances for Pitt—gave

Hurley not only scored all three of the Orangemen’s
touchdowns including one spectacular’ score where
Hurley literally ﬂew across the goal-line, but gave the
Panther defense all it could handle with his runs and
short passes. Not to be outdone, however, the Pitt
defense once again made the big plays and eased the
offensive burden. "

Playing before several bowl scouts, the Panthers
did not make an overly impressive showing, but
nevertheless Jackie Sherrill was glad it was over:
“Syracuse always plays tough and I’m glad it’s oyer.
We made a lot of mistakes, but once again it was that
big defense that came through when we needed them
most.” , "

Unlike other Pitt opponents, Syracuse showed the
ability to move the ball on the Panther defense. The
Orange had 299 total yards, the most against Pitt this
year. The same Pitt defense that played seven super
games suffered a letdown early when starting left
tackle Greg Meisner was injured on the first play of
the game. The loss of Meisner was a big key
according to Sherrill. .

“The loss of Meisner hurt us because we had t
insert and inexperienced player at the tackle slot,”
Sherrill said. “Against an option team like Syracuse,
that can be dangerous.”

At the beginning of the day, the storyiwas the first
start of freshman quarterback Dan Marino. The
long-awaited debut did not equal the expectations
however, as the young‘ quarterback appeared
nervouspand did not conduct the offense with the
crispness of the previous week. Although he

performance, something not deemed possible of the
super frosh. . ‘ ’

According to Dan Fidler, the starting left -guard, ‘

the story of the offense had a somewhat familiar
tune. a , 4 ,

“We could have- scored more, but. it was the

should have run the ball better on them,rbut we just
had a bad day. Upsets occur all the time, so do off-
days, and today we had an of f-day.”

Most of the offensive players believed it was a
combination of bad play on their part and the fact
the Orangemen played over their heads. But as
Ralph Still put it, the Panthers are good enoughto
beat anybody. .

‘‘I definitely feel that we’re major bowl material,
we just had a bad day—that’s all,” Still said.
f‘Syracuse always plays tough, so it was one of those
things. But as far as a bowl bid goes, we could play
with anybody.” ‘ ,

Although it allowed 13 points more than its
season average, the Panther defense saved the day.
Even the first touchdown of the day was scored by a
Panther defensive player, Terry White, on an 85-yard
punt return. For the junior from Georgia, who early
the
performance established him as one of the key
elements in that great defense. Although White was
named defensive player’of the game by the television
broadcasters, it was the play of the

“I feel we

‘ ‘other’ ’-

could. be considered for All-America honors_.\

Unfortunately ‘for Jackson and fortunately for Pitt,

he plays opposite Hugh Green, which can be a‘

frustrating experience. For a player who made 14
tackles,‘ Ricky J_ackson.was virtuallyignored by the
writers, who preferred to crowd around Hugh Green.

- Jackson, however, understands and realizes he has

3 ‘.‘

« nothing to prove. 1

“Hugh is an All-American, and he deserves all the

creditlin the world,’ he said. “I’d like to get more-

publicity because I feel I deserve it, but the stats
speak- for themselves. «I madethe most tackles on
the field, so what can I say? Hugh makes more

spectacular plays than I do because he rushes and I‘

defend passes, but I make my share of big plays.
That’s why I donft think it’s fair when they compare
Hugh and me. We do different things.”

When the game was on the line, it was Jackson:
who came up with the big play. Late in the 4th.
quarter, the Orangemen had a fourth and two deep
in Pitt territory. It was Jackson who denied Hurley

the run option by stringing out the play. and halting '

all hopes of an upset for Syracuse. ’

“It was a run option, and I did my job by stringing
out the play all the way to the sidelines when he
pitched it, there was nowhere for the halfback to
go,” said Jackson. '

Now that the worst part of the schedule is behind
them, the.Panthers can now concentrate on the likes
of West Virginia and Army before the big showdown
with Penn State. Pitt should get by the Mountaneers,

, although it might be tougher than expected due to the

intensity of the rivalry. As for bowls, the Panthers
now seem in line for a second-line bowl, something
likethe Fiesta or the Gator. The Panthers will have

(Continued from page 8)
Syracuse would come out with
something different, and they did,
using an unbalanced line and two
tight ends. \

“The unbalanced line forced us
to do some things that we wouldn’t

normally do,” he said. “It was
the cause of most of our defensive
mistakes.”

With a comfortable halftime
lead, the Panthers seemed to let
down going into the third quarter-

".'7until Syracuse began to catch ﬁre.
The Orange took the ball on their

_ own 41-yard line after a 33-yard

punt by Trout. _ -

The Orange picked up large
amounts of yardage on the drive,
much of it on keepers by Hurley.
After 13 plays and more than six
minutes, Syracuse scored on a two-
yard keeper by Hurley. With the
extra point, Syracuse drew to
within a touchdown and two-point
conversion of tying the game. A

The Syracuse touchdown seemed
to put a much-needed spark in the
Pitt offense as the Panthers toot ‘
the ball at their own 19 and moved

;,.¢.~'"': in for a score. On the fourth play of
the drive, Marino completed 1
screen pass to DiBartola who took i:

later, after Marino completed a

Jones ran around left end for the
ﬁnal Panther score. Pitt now had a

28-13. ,

' tricks on the women's ﬁeld hockey

team, handing them a 4-0 loss for
Halloween. The Pantherette’s
_ended_ their season with a record of
3-8.
A Pitt was in control the first 20
‘minutes of play, forcing Davis and
Elkins into a defensive game.
However, Pitt couldn’t put the ball
in the goal, nor could it hold off
Davis and Elkin’s explosive offense
any longer.
The Senators caught ﬁre with 12
minutes left in the first half, as Sue

~ Lapriore slapped in their first goal.

One minute later, Davis and

, Elkin’s scored again.

Then, Pitt’s Dee Dee Kantner
had a chance to score on, a penalty
shot. After putting the ball past
the Senator's goalie, the referee
erased the score, saying that

1 Kantner had made a foot violation.

with their spirits obviously dam-
penedt, the Pantherette’s allowed
Davis and Elkins to score one more
time with 20 seconds remaining
making the score 3-0 at halftime.
Sue Lapriore scored her second
goal of the day against Pitt two
minutes into the second half, After
that, the game became a see-saw
battle between the goals with
neither team mounting a signiﬁ-
cant attack.
Although the regular season is
over, the Pantherettes still have a
_lot to look forward to. This
weekend they participated in the
Pittsburgh Trials. An “all-star”
team will be formed to advance to
the Mideast tournament on No-
vember 11 and 12, where once
again, a team will be elected to
advance to nationals. According to
Coach Audrey Gerginski, several of
Pitt’s players have a chance to
make it to nationals.
