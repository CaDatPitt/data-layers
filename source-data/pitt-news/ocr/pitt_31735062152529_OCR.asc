Revote Motion, Draft
Modiﬁcation

 

A-mid an atmosphere thick with ,

evident political bickering, tersenes-s

and open dissatisfaction between

 representatives from the engineer-

’ ing and dental schools on one side
and the college and business admin-
istration representatives on the oth-
er, Student Council had a rather
uncomfortable time of it on Wednes-
day night. ,_

From a maze, of spirited di'séus-
sion mainly of veiled implications of
political maneuvering hurled back"
-and forth among the delegates, the‘
governing organization succeeded in
accomplishing one deﬁnite bit of ac-

’ tion. This measure consisted in
passage of a motion to investigate
food prices as charged by’_ the Um-
versity cafeteria and which 0 were
termed “proﬁteering” by Jesse Z1z-
more, Bus. Ad. ’31, who appeared _be-
fore Council to make the complmnt.

Zizmore cited ﬁgures to support
his contention that the cafeteria
was charging excessive "prices and

_ his suggestion that an immediate in-
vestigation be opened was the.»-one
thing that Council seemed ' agreed
upon, during the tense session.

"The vote on the Men's Self ‘ Gov-

for the disturbance and after" all the
ﬁliebustering, Council ‘ found _that it
had advanced nowhere in its con-

A <pstition presented by a minori-

manding that a revote on the M. S.

irregularities in the referendum
staged March 30 was voted downby
a seven to six count. A second mo-
tion, advanced by Emanuel Fish-
kin, head of the M. S.  A._ com-
mittee, calling for a modiﬁcation in
the proposed constitution so as to
give each campus school equal repre-
sentation was also -side-tracked by
opponents to the measure. This mo-

Major Thomas Coulson of the

tricaci-es c-on-nected with the activi-
ties of the United Statesvlntelligeence
Bureau durin the «World War.
An extreme y colorful and event-
ful ‘career has been that of Major
Coulson. From childhood 3, wan-
derer, he has visited nearly every
country in Europe. After years of
wide and varied experience, he ﬁrst
saw military service in Tripoli and
later in the Ba-lkanvsuln both coun-
tries are vast backgrounds of general
knowledge, and his intimate knowl-
edge of European peoples and lan-
guages, and his experience in mili-
tary matters naturally ﬁt-ted, him
for the battle of wits when the time
came to meet cunning with super-
-cunncin and plot with counter plot.
For 's services in counter-esp.ion-
age in Ireland, England, and France,
Major Coulson was“‘decorated three
times and mentioned in Lord Haig’s
dispatches. Finally, at the conclu-
sion of the Armistice, he was con-
sidered so indispensable that he was
sent to Germany for three years,
during which time ‘he met many 0
his war-time antagonists.

Emanuel Fishkin, Bus. Ad. '31,
will preside at the meeting.

Theta Chis,
Lead Lodges
In Standing

Alpha  Alpha Takes
Second Place With
1.50 A Average

Theta Chi with a quality point
average of 1.58 led all Pitt fraterni-
ties in the scholastic standing for the
first semester of the present school
year, according to an announcement
made this week by Theodore _W.~Bid-
dle, assistant to the dean of men.

The averages were computed by the
oﬁice of the registrar. __

1 Alpha Phi Alpha followed in sec-
ond, place with an average of 1.50,
having jumped from the thirteenth
position which this group occupled
-last year. ‘

Pi.Lambda Phi and Theta Kappa.
Nu retained third and fourth posi-
tions, respectively, -for the second
consecutive semester.

The all-fraternity average was
computed to be 1.175 and the all
men's average at 1.271. The laitter
ﬁgure is not accu.ra.te inasmuch as
it‘. was obtained by a process of
“rand-orm sa.-mzplrn-g,” that is, by com-
,piling the average of every ﬁfth
man ‘belonging to a fraternity. _

Fraternities to show marked 1m-
provement in their scholastic rec-
ord during the past semester ‘includ-
ed Sigma Alpha Mu, which jumped
from twelfth position to slxth place;
Theta Delta Psi, jumping from 17th
to 7th place, and Omega Psi Phi,
from 21st place to 11th place.

Omega Delts Drop

Omega Delta, which had the high-
est standing last year, dropped to
.tw'elfth\ position in the ﬁgures just
  
slipped from tenth position to he
‘twentieth place.

No award will be given to the
winner of the standing this semester
because of the recent action of In-
terfr-aternity Council providing that
a plaque be awarded yearly to the
fraternity maintaining the highest
average for the two semesters. This
plaque will be awarded for the ﬁrst
time next February. .

Although there are several fra-
ternities near the danger line, none
will be placed on probation because
of low scholastic standing, according
to Biddle. Fraternities with aver-
ages 1e.s:s than .750 are, placed on
probation and are not privileged to
pledge men until the average is
brought up to this percentage.

Spring is one thin ; the hot spring
sun is another. undreds of stu-
dents who waited in line to exchange
tickets for Cap and Gown last
Wednesday afternoon wished for a
little less of the burning rays.

A. E. Ortmann, a graduate stu-
dent in the School of Education,
won the honor of being first in line.
He was at the booth marked “Satur-
day Night” at 3:30, two and a half
hours before the box offices opened.
He was soon joined by other record
breakers: Virginia King, Alice Hall,
Robert Lindsay, James West and
William Marschﬁeld, who were ﬁrst
in line at the other booths.

Traditionally the windows of the
Weekly office were kept pasted over
with bulletins giving the exact time
and words of comfort and encourage-
ment. The crowds of waiting stu-
dents who ﬁlled the pavement and
street were told to bear up. O’Sulli-
van’s Heels were recommended for
fallen arches. More cynical signs an-
nounced “There’s one born every
minute.”

Debaters Meet ‘

In Quaker City

“End A 10-Day Tour Against
Temple Saturday Night

Boston, April 9.-—(Special).--Men
debaters of the University of Pitts-
burgh, on an eight-meet tour of the
East, stopped here today on their
way to New Brunswick, N. J ., from
Durha.m,’N. H. Tonight they meet
Rutgers in the New Jersey town,
having argued the unemployment
insurance question with speakers
from the University of New Hamp-
shire at Durham. ‘

Friday night, Edward Crowder,
Col. ’31, and Jess Spirer, Col. ’31, de-
bate University of Pennsylvania in
Philadelphia. They remain in the
Quaker City overnight, having the
Temple University debating team
also on their schedule. They are ac-
companied by Professor W. M. Par-
rish, debate coach.

Previously on their extensive trip
eastward, the Smoky -ity forensic-.
ers encountered College of the City
of New York in the metropolis at
the College Club in George Wash-
ington Hotel, Friday, April 3. A ra-
dio debate with New York Univer.
sity over Station WEVD on Satur-
day, also featured their stay in New
York City.

Like Boston

From there they hopped a night
steamer for Boston where two de-
-hates with Boston University and
Radcliﬁ’ Collegeowere held. They
were especially impressed by Boston
hospitality during their two-day stay
there. The Boston U. engagement
took place at Norfolk, a few miles
outside of the Hub.

The Radcliif affair was a real in-
novation. It was a spit-team com--
bination, Crowder pairing up with
Lois Smith against Spirer and
Christine Lannigan in debating the
insurance problem. “Charming,
charming, indeed!” was the Pitts-
burgh estimate of Radcliff feminin-
ity. They were guests at a private
dance after the debate.

.publicity. Special
duties may be assigned to the or-
ganization committee.

Nominations for W. S. G. A. of-
ficers, which are made by Senior
Court and one faculty advisor, are
to be delayed three weeks. The time
for nominations to go to the execu-
tive committee, heretofore, was on
the ﬁrst executive meeting in March.
The time is chan d to the second
meeting. This gives Senior Court
three extra weeks to work on nom-
inations. »-

Another amendment is the com-
bining of the decorations and prop-
erty committees into one committee.

The last revision is that all com-
mittees shall be approved by the ex-
ecutive committee, including cus-
toms committee.

Senior Court was in charge of
all ballots and tables for the elec-
tion, and took the returns. The
“Question Mark,” which is the offi-
cial publication ‘of W.‘ S. G. A., was
published by Sara Josselson, Col.
32; Hermine Ruoff, Col. '31, chief
justice of Senior Court, stated that
the amount of interest shown by the
percentage of votes given each or-
ganization was very high, and she
considered the election a success.

stated that the dental students were
opposed to any plan that would elim-
inate their present majority on Stu-
dent -Council and that they were
convinced that M. S. G. A. was sim-
ply a plan devised to throw them
out of control. -

Stirling was particularly emphatic
in denying that he he electioneered
at the polls saying “ ere was ab-
solutely no electioneering by me at
the polls, although I see no reason
to explain why I did electioneelf
against the plan before the referen-
duin_. I am unalterably opposed to
the plan.”

Following the prolonged discus-
sion of M. S. G.‘ A., Stirling moved
that Council proceed with internal
elections but this motion was de-
feated and action deferred until next
week.

“Cafeteria Food Sold High”.

Zizmore in presenting ﬁgures to
show “proﬁteering” of the cafeteria
said that the cost of vegetable salad
to the cafeteria was 7 cents and that
it was sold to students for 25 cents;
ham sandwiches cost 5 cents and
were sold for 15 cents; and that a
proﬁt of 1100 per cent was being
made on the sale of prunes.

Several members of council point-
ed out that Zizmore had neglected to
ﬁgure’ in the overhead costs of the
restaurant in computing his figures.

On Tuesday, April 7, Professor
Janes s oke at the Alpha Kappa Psi,

eon, held in the private dining room
of the Hotel Roosevelt.

Professor J anes traced» the growth
of corporations from the beginning
of the Mortmain policy and took up
the development of large scale busi-
ness units. Professor Janes stated
that the purpose of corporation law
is to build business steadily on a
sound basis. He illustrated this with
the instance of the par-value rule
later being chan ed to the non-par-
yalue rule. Furt er, he stressed the
importance of recognizing the rights
of the stockholders in a corporation,

Two Changes

 

Executive Board Of Seven To
Act As President

Two important modiﬁcations in
the nomination and election of Y. M.
C. A. officers for the coming year

are being considered, subject to ﬁnal
ratiﬁcation by the Committee of
Management.

The ﬁrst modiﬁcation relates to
the method of election. In the past,
the Y. M. C. A. elections have been
satisfactory neither to‘ the individ-
ual voting member nor to the Y. M.
C. A. itself. The student voting
memberkcould not vote intelligently
on many of the names which were
being proposed. To overcome this
difficulty, an electoral body of ap-
proximately twenty men will be set
up to choose the officers. This elec-
toral body will be composed of rep-
resentatives of the various Y. M. C.
A. organizations, such as the Den-
tal Association, Freshman Associa-
tion, Cabinet, and Committee of
Management, etc.

The second proposal concerns the

umber of officers to be elected. In
lhe past it has been the custom to
elec one president. It seems prac-
ticaly impossible for one president
to have t_e time and range of in-
terests to encompass the entire scope
and program .0f the Y. M. C. A. The
executives feel that the present sys-
tem leaves many fields of the “Y”
program with no stimulating student
S1; ervision. It is suggested that
to her than having one president,
the eérscutiyes consist of an Execu-
ive , omniittee of seven men. The
Council as a who e will in__eet week-

Students Like
Danc_e__Survey

More Than 200 Interviews
Made During First Week

A willingness and enthusiasm in
more than two hundred representa-
tive Pitt students to be questioned
by the dance survey committee
marked the activity of the group as
it completed its ﬁrst week in an in-
vestigation of social life on the
campus. Initiated by Student Re-
lations Committee, the quiz is to
cover more than ﬁve hundred repre-

and not affiliated with activities, and
is to close next Friday.

According to chairman of the
committee, Carl Voss, Col. ’31, the
questionnaire forms are producing
a considerable amount of valuable
student opinion which, when tabu-
lated, will indicate how Pitt men
and women feel about their social
life. The purpose of the survey is
to obtain facts of time, effort and
money expended in university social
affairs.

Groups on the campus being inter-
viewed consist of a random group
of more than two hundred represen-
tative men and women seventy-ﬁve
prominent activity students, general
university dance chairmen, men and

Interfraternity dance chairmen. The
results of questioning will probably
be known by May 15, according to
oss.
Members of the committees, be-
sides Voss, are Ben Sufrine, Col.
’31, personal query chairman, as-
sisted b ‘Ruth Goodman, Col. ’33;
Elinor mith, Ed. ’33, Panhellenic
uery chairman, assisted by Evelyn
laisell, Col. ’33; William Young,
sol. ’33, general dance chairman, as-
sisted by Cornelia Brierly, Col. ’34,
and Robert Beck, Ed. ’32, interfra-
ternity query chairman, assisted by
Milton Shore, Col. ’32, and Rosalie
Quill, Col. ’34, general secretary,

At Senior Singing on the steps of

A pipe and Edgewortli-this is

College men everywhere respond
to the appeal of pipes—packed with
cool, slow-burning Edgeworth. Be
guided by their choice: Try Edge-

measurably by Edgeworth’s dis-

Baltimore is responsible each year
for the or nization of the system
of judges y whom the books are
selected.

Dr. McKown, professor of secon-
dary education, has published three
books in the general field of extra-
curricular activities and all three
have been included in these lists:
“Extra-curricular Activities," in
1827; “School Clubs,” in 1929, and
“Assembly and Auditorium Activi-

Hermine Ruoﬂ’, Mary Munsch, Sarah Drum, Naomi Ericson, and Anne Rosenweig are ﬁve of the
six candidates for Senior Queen who will be elected at a primary on ‘Wednesday. AP111 13-

Wlzen Photographer [3 Near
Senior Queen Candidates
Arc Serious, Regal

The group of sedate seniors as
caught by the photographer looks
like iniamples of the seriouness that
is supposed to be a part of college
life.

But, mentally, can’t ou visualize
them as they were-—an as they are
most of the time-—a moment before
the camera man - said, “Steady,
now!”

Chuckles from Mary Munsch, effi-
cient Senior Class president; smiles
from Chief Justice Hermine Ruoff;
a broad grin from Student Cou«ncel-
lor Naomi Ericson; giggles—-prob-
ably——frorn Panhellenic President
Sarah Drum; twinkles around the
eyes from every-committee woman,
Ann Rosensweig.

And the dark horse—there’s one
in every election, you know-—would
have been peppered with dimples,
lélaifaret Hall, president of W. S.

For the senior queen candidates
are, each one of them, happy com-
bination of sedateness and levity.

Naomi Ericson, intelligent, vital,
has dark brown hair, curly, and ha-
zel eyes. Besides her numerous ac-
tivities and her studies, her chief
interest is in the law.

Margaret Hall leans toward Erie
Center in the moments which are
EMA engaged with Latin and W. S.

Stateliness is somehow synony-
mous with Ann Rosensweig‘. Her
head is held at a regal angle, yet
there is not a hint of haughtiness
about her.

Lovable frankness is the outstand-
ing characteristic of “Smiling Mary”

Munsch. This with a quick sense of
humor and a wide-awake intelligence,
makes the senior president one of
the most friendly girls in her class.

Hermine Ruoff is Ann Rosen-
sweig’s only rival in regality. A
classicly beautiful blond with blue
eyes, she has been one of the most
outstanding coeds in the school ever
since her freshman year.

Wisdom almost mystical at times
confused with a ‘disposition prone
to laughter typiﬁes Sarah Drum. She
is particularly adept at making peo-
ple comfortable, socially.

Each of the coeds chosen for the
primary ballotting next Wednesday
has the attributes of personality,
representative-ness, and activities to
qualify her for the honor of Senior
Queen. The first election will be by
the preferential ballot as especially
adapted by Mr. James C. Charles-
worth, instructor in Political Sci-
ence, for the senior class. Two can-
didates will be chosen from the six.
These two will be voted upon again
at the second balloting which will
be held on the succeeding Wednes-
day. Of these two, the, one receiving
the highest number of votes will be
Queen and the defeated candidate
will be Alma Mater. The results of
this second election will be kept se-
cret until Tap Day, at which time
the choice of the class will be an-
nounced.

The Senior Queen typiﬁes every
Pitt senior in the exercises which
mark part of the women’s events
during senior week. Thirty other
prominent coeds will take part in
this traditional ceremony in which
the senior queen is crowned.

400 Invited
  For Play Day

Olympic Games, City-States
To Be Themes Of Day

 

With the ﬁfth annual intercollegi-
ate play day scheduled for Friday,
May 8, over 400 women from eight-
een colleges of Western Pennsyl-
vania have been invited to be the
guests of the Women’s Athletic As-
sociation. The day will culminate in
a formal banquet Friday evening.

Although the arrangements for the
event are not entirely completed, the
spring play day is to follow closely
the theme of the Greek Olympic
games, each college representing a.
Greek city-state. For the banquet
the same theme is to be followed, the
elevated tables forming an amphi-
theater. '

Claire Cryder, Ed. ’32, who is gen-
eral chairman of the event, has
named four women as'co-chairmen
in carrying out her plans: Goldye
Glick, Ed. ’32, publicity; Virginia
Whitﬁeld, Ed. ’32, hospitality; Dor-
othy Lee, Ed. ’33, ﬁeld activities;
Ann Rosensweig, ’32, banquet.

The University of Pittsburgh re-
tains the honor of being one of the
first colleges to inaugurate Women’s
play day in the East, the custom or-
iginated in California. Since its in-
itial appearance here five years ago,
play day has become a popular event
in all eastern schools.

The 400 women who will partici-
pate May 8, enter non-competitive
playing, each of them being dele-
gated to a color team, through which
they retain their identiﬁcation dur-
ing the day, and later at the ban-
quet.

In addition to the active partici-
pants, over 50 committee women
have been completin _detai1 work of
play day: Goldye G ck’s assistants
include Rhoda Levy, Col. ’32, city
publicity; Jean Shoup, Ed. '32 local
publicity; Mary Lou McConnell, Ed.
32; Selda Levin, Col. '33; Helen Sitz,
Col. ’34, correspondence; Jean Coch-
ran, Col. ’33, oster; Jean Muller,
Col. ’32, snaps ot; Helen Weideli,
Col.‘ ’33. P

Six women are aiding Virginia
Whitﬁeld in hospitality arrange-
ments: Alice Eibeck, Ed. ’32; Nettie
Gensheimer, Ed. ’32, basketroom;
Jane Walton, Ed. ’33, transportation;
Jane Wille, Ed. ’32, gymnasium;

Tyson Gives

Talk__At Erie 6“

Commend; Pittsburgh Plan
In Erie Center Speech

 

At the Men’s Dinner Forum, Erie
Club, and in a lecture before the
students of the Erie Center, Francis
Tyson, Professor of Economics spoke
last Tuesday evening on “How We
May Make Employment More Se-
cure.” Dr. Tyson pointed out that
inﬂuential representatives of indus-
try and ﬁnance are taking the lead
in dealing with the difficult prob-
lems of unemployment raised by this
depression in a more vigorous fash-
ion than ever before. He referred
to the widespread “staggering” of
work by industry and the general
effort to maintain wage rates in face
of a difficult price situation.

The speaker stated that fortu-
natel larger funds were available for
relie at this time than during ear-
lier depressions because of the suc-
cess of the Community Chest Move-
ment. He expressed the opinion that
social work should be carried on as
usual, and philanthropy should not
be required to meet the impossible
task of absorbing the shock burden
of widespread unemployment. Un-
der the Pittsburgh Plan during the
last month about $600,000 has been
expended as wages for work in ad-
dition to ‘nearly ‘$1,000,000 of
planned public expenditure for mate-
rials and supervision, which would
not otherwise have been made b
Pittsburgh and the boroughs of A -
legheny county.

Dr. Tyson referred also to the in-
creased interest being shown by em-
ployers in the establishment of un-
employment reserve funds that
might be accumulated in good years
for payment _of partial wages in
times _of inevitable unem loyment.
He pointed to_ the value o such re-
serves . if widely established, by
maintaining purchasing power and
markets for materials and to the
use of them as tools in deterring the
prolongation of depression periods.
He commented favorably upon the
new plan of _ the General Electric
Company which now covers. some
80,000 workers, under which a joint
contribution by the corporation and
the employes sets aside 2 per cent
of the wage roll for payments of a
maximum of $20 a week covering a
period of ten weeks employment.

The speaker_ expressed the belief
that from this depression would
come the more eﬁ'ective planning
of public works to provide employ-
ment in periods of distress, so that
in the future unemployment would
ec_ome a less severe and baﬁling
social problem.

The leaders of the Erie Civic Em-
ployment Committee are considering
the adoption of a modified form of
the Pittsburgh Plan to meet their
own emergency pmblem,

Senior Ball

Group Picked

Chairman Garver Announces
Schenley A: Location

Deﬁnite steps toward making the
Senior Ball one ofthe most bril-
liant functions on the campus in
years were taken this week by Hu-
bert Garver, Dent. ’31, who an-
nounced a committee of prominent
Pitt seniors to aid him in planning
the affair. Garver has announced
that the scene of the event will be
the Schenley Hotel ballroom.

The committee is composed of
Bernadette Connolly, Ed.; Emily
Mumpher, Col.; Naomi Erickson,
Ed.; Marie Brackman, Col.; Llew-
elyn Teale, Dent.; Nathan Schup-
per, Dent.; Eddie Schultz, Col.;
Leroy Black, Bus. Ad. ; Charles
Dunn, Phar.; Howard Stevens.
Eng.; Robert Remaley, Col.; Don-
ald Gearhart, Dent., and Ben Suf-
rine, Col.

Chairman Garver is dickering
with nationally known orchestras,
some of radio fame, others who have
played at exclusive and smart set af-
fairs, still others now taking a run
of the leading college and univer-
sity promenades. He says, “The
Senior Ball this year will have the
best music in history. It is not too
early to promise that the band will
be famous and well known.”

The committee will be called to-
gether for a meeting next week to
decide upon guests, chaperons, sub-
chairmen and other matters of im-
portance.

Concerning the ball, Garver has
this to say: “With the selection of
the committee, I am ready to go
ahead in planning for the function
which is to close the formal campus
social life for the senior. I shall
have the average senior in mind, the
one who wants to remember his
Senior Ball in later ears, when I
formulate plans for t e band, deco-
ratipns, programs, lighting effects,

College today, Pitt will be well
represented in both prestige and
spirit. Besides Margaret Hall, Col.
’31, national president; Miss Helen
Rush, assistant dean of women will
speak before the assembly on Mod-
ern Trends in Education. Hermine
Ruoff, Col. ’31, national chairman
of finance will speak also.

Ten members of the active chap-
ter will be present beside the offi-
cial delegate, Rose Marie Deme-
stiches, including Mary Lou McCon-
nell, Ed., treasurer Betty Cassell,
Col., secretary; Helen Widelli, Dor-
othy Getsinger, Col.; Kay Sheekey,
Ed.; Sarah‘ Dunmire, Col.; Ruth
Hamilton, Col.; Helen Glynn, Col.;
Evelyn Blaisdell, C01. and Yetta
Cohen, Col., all sophomores.
Among the problems confronting
Cwens, which will be discussed, ac-
cordin to Miss Hall, have been the
difficuﬁzy of dignifying a ﬁnancial
program in a self supporting organ-
ization, the procedure for establish-
ing contacts with freshman women
and the problems of carrying out a
program of service. The difficulties
will be discussed.

Pleasure will be well mixed with
business, due to hospitable efforts of
the Allegheny girls. A formal ban-
quet, a play, a tea and bridge are
included in the program in addition
to the business meetings and gen-
eral assemblies.

Representatives from the chapters
at Carnegie Tech, Penn State, Miami
University, and the University of
St. Louis will also be there.

Downtown Students
Amend Constitution

Downtown Students’ Association
held a meeting Wednesday evening,
April 1, in Room 1014 of the Cham-
bar of Commerce Building.

The members voted upon proposed
changes and amendments to the D.
S. A. constitution. One of the fore-
most changes concerned the re-
quirements for officers. Since the
student body has become larger, it
was necessary to make the associa-
tion more inclusive. Another impor-
tant amendment dealt with the ex-
ecutive committee. In the future
the non-affiliated group will have
four representatives. The executive
committee will be a continuing body
rather than a yearly one.

, The changes and amendments
were proposed by the executives,
president, Edward Linhart; treas-
urer of the University; vice presi-
dent, H. P. Ruprecht, secretary; S
Brynn; treasurer, Albert Grace.
They were assisted by the executive
committee which was composed of
Charles Walker, Ellen Chalfant,
William Workmaster, Gerald
O’Brien, Katherine Baker and

 

Gladys Park.

DID YOU EVER make three B's
in as many courses, and then seize
a pencil to scribble a note home to
tell the glad news; and instead of
the expected pecuniary remunera-
tion receive a note, terse and short,
that unless those D’s are C's you had
better quit. Try writing your let-
ters with a good fountain pen from
the Singer Pen Shop in the Jenkin’s
Arcade, and avoid all misunder-
standings.

FOR THESE LAZY, unenergetic
spring days the best tonic is a tasty
sandwich or a salad, 9. glass of cold
milk and a fruity dessert eaten in
the light and airy Kookley Tearoom
on Forbes street pear‘ Oakland.

IF YOUR WATCH gets spring
fever, or if it gets too energetic and
gets you to an eighty-thirty ten
minutes too early, take it to Rodney
and Volmich on the ﬁfth floor of the
Clark Building. They give you a
substitute to carry while your own
watch is being repaired, and is that
a help in getting to engagements on
time? * * *

EVERYTHING and anything in
leather might well be the motto of
the Techbound Studio on Bouquet
street. And I add that there you
can ﬁnd clever little gifts within
the reach of any pocketbook. For
instance, there are little leather
pocketbooks of all shades imaginable
and there are little leather-bound
books which would make ideal favors
for a party. They are just about an
inch high and a quarter of an inch
wide. Three of them just ﬁt in a
ring-box.

DOCTORS AGREE that it is
wrong for students to ski lunch,
and with the Betsey Ross room
so near campus on the corner of
Forbes and Oakland streets, the ‘
usual excuses are null and void. For
the Betsey Ross is near, it's inex-
pensive and the service is quick and
eﬁicient.

AND DON'T be afraid to walk -in
the Oakland branch of the Peoples-
Pittsburgh Trust Company on the
corner of Meyran and Forbes street
and ask for ﬁnancial advice. They
can help you plan to save a little"
from the money you have coming

Student Mailbag

To The Editor:
May I take the opportunity of ex-
pressing through the Pitt Weekly
just why hundreds of engineering
students voted against the proposed
MSGA? O
The general census of opinion held
by the engineers was that the pro-
posed MSGA was decidedly unfair to
all schools excepting the College and
School of Business Administration.
The joker clause permitting activities
representation would undoubtedly
have resulted in a “packed" associa-
tion for the two schools mentioned.
As for the charges of fraudulent
voting, they are absurd and false, in-
dicative of poor sportsmanship in the
face of the overwhelming defeat of
the proposed ‘IISGA. _

Beck, Hugus, Neidig Named
To Interfrat Ofﬁces

Frank Goodfellow, Phi Delta
Theta, was elected president of In-
terfraternity Council for next year
at the monthly meeting held Tues-
day night. ,

Other officers elected for next

year were: Robert Beck, Phi Gamma
Delta, vice president; Charles Hugus,
Theta Delta Psi, secretary, and
Harry Neidig, Lambda Chi Alpha,
treasurer.
— Aside from the election, Interfra-
ternity Council had a quiet session
this month with business being re-
stricted to committee reports and
presentation of cups to victorious
fraternities in athletic contests held
thls year.

Kappa Nu was awarded the
basketball cup; Theta Chi, a cup‘ for
winning the recent bridge tourna-
ment, and Delta Sigma Phi, a cup
as bowling champions.

It was also reported -that the pro-
posed conference of fraternities
which was originally to have been
held on the campus this spring, has
been postponed until next fall. Lack
of time to make adequate prepara-
tions was. the reason given by the
commiattee in charge of this event.

Goodfellow, the new president, has
been active in Interfraternity Coun-
_cil work for the past two years. He
is assistant comptroller of the Pitt
Weekly, and a former assistant foot-
ball manager. He is also a member
of Druids, national Sophomore ac-
tivities fraternity.

To see what had been brought‘ to

And found attempted melody (.7)
Upon a pale white sheet.

A melody that sang of ﬁght,

Of smoking, drinking, swearing,

And wondered, “Wouldn't it be nice
If there were none of these?”

For two days long I thought and

thought
Of all this ugly world’s crime;
For two days long my freer time
Was occupied with that.

And now‘ I whisk back thru. the

By ETHEL DANEORTH

He may be just a horse to you,
but he's a ‘mountain tome!

So you think as for the ﬁrst time

you survey the world from horse-
back in the Pittsburgh Riding Club
on Bigelow boulevard during the
Saturday riding classes. :

The equine quadruped somehow
looks far different from the top than
he does from the side. ' Those sturdy
shoulders and arching neck seem
sort of thin. Those ‘slender. legs
stretch interminably to the distant
ground. What if you should tobog-
gani down his neck some time when
he stoops to eat grass? And when
he turns his head towards you--is
that a derisive» smile lurking In his
eyes? ' i

Lieu-tenant Madden ties the curb
reins into a knoton thehorse’s neck.
and hands you the bit reins. “Hold
them in two hands; draw‘ them
through the lists and clamp your
thumb over your ﬁrst funger. O. K.-
Let’s go." .

“This is easy," you think as the
class ambles around and around the
enclosed arena. “Just sit back and
let the horse do the work. Good old
horsie," leaning over to pet him tim-
idly. “I bet I look as though I'd
been born in a saddle. Wild west
riders have nothing on “me!”

Then the order comes to trot
“Lean forward a little, press with
your knees, have your weight on the
stirrups and tighten the reins.” As
though one could do that all at
once! But oh, the trotting-—that is
what makes the amateur equestri-

Women Debaters End A
Season With P.  W.

A debate on Wednesday evening, ‘

April 8, with Pennsylvania College
for Women's newly organized team,
has closed the season of women’s
debating for this year. The ques-
tion adopted only for this last de-
bate was “Resolved, that the emer-
gence of married women from the
home into professional and indus-
trial pursuits is a detriment to so-
ciety.” Marie Hocksmuth, C01. 331;

Louise Linn", Ed. '32, and Eleanore .

Kerber, Col. '31, argued the nega-
tive. ‘

This year has been the greatest
collegiate debate year that the wom-
en have ever had at Pitt. One long
trip was added to the usual itiner-
ary with such satisfactory results
that already plans are being formed
for an even more extensive trip next

. The show, which is a musical take-
of in two_ascents and twelve land-
ings, deals with the adventures of
one Lord Montgomery, played by
James Halliwell, Eng. ’34, in his ca-
pacity as ﬁnancial backer for a mo-
tionpicture company. The Lord has
fallen in love with and won the af-
fection of a wealthy American girl,
Betty Foster, whose part is taken
by Jack Allen, Bus. Ad. '31.

To satisfy his inherited spirit of
sportsmanship, the Lord decides to
take a sporting chance on his im-
pending wedding. To that end he
takes out an insurance policy with
Lloyds of London, who, for a prem-
ium of $25,000, guarantees to pay
him a quarter of a million dollars

Sam Parks Jr., captain of the
newly formed golf team at the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh, is in Pine-
hurst, North Carolina, this week

competing in the N orth-South ama-
teur golf tournament. T.

Among those competing with
Parks for the coveted championship
are George Dunlap Jr., intercollegi-
ate champion this year, Richard
Tufts of Pinehurst, Sidney Noyes,
member of the Yale golf team, Eu-
gene Homans, M. P. Warner and a
number of prominent amateurs.

In the ﬁrst qualifying round
Parks shot an 82 to be in among
the leaders. ‘

When Parks returns from the
North-South tournament practice
will start in earnest to put out a
representative golf team at Pitt. Ac-
cording to plans now prevailing the
candidates for the team will prac-
tise at their home courses and will
meet once a week in conjunction
with the rest of the men.

Nothing deﬁnite has been done
about scheduling. matches, but prob-

Mushball Tournament
To Be Arranged For
Fraternity Men I

With summer just around -the cor-
ner and the houses too hot during
the evenings for the boys to sit in-
doors and play bridge, the house-
men of the various fraternities are
looking around for recreation after
the 6 o’clock meal. ,

The in-terfraternity track ‘meet

" .-and sweepstakes ‘will soon be" here",

but they will occupy the minds of
the boys for just a day and then
there will be nothing more to do. '

For the past several ‘years, the
houses have been indulging in mush-‘
ball games during the evenings in
the latter part of May, but due to
the fact that interfraternity . coun-
cil does not sponsor the competition
in this sport, no champion has eve_r
been crowned. . ’

In order to. alleviate this condi-
tion, the Weekly sports staff is will-
ing to sponsor an interfratermty
mushball league this spring pro-
vided that a sufficient number 0
lodges are interested in the sub-
ject. ,

. There are many vacant lots
around the campus which the boys
could secure easily for these games.
Regulation balls and bats can be se-
cured at minimum cost, and such a
league would not involve great
ﬁnancial outlay to the teams en-
tered in it.

Any fraternity interested in suoh
a proposal is requested to get in
touch with Morris Cohen or Bob Re-
maley at the Weekly office. As soon
as a sufficient number of fraternities
have entered, rules for the tourna-
ment will be drawn up and the

“Scrimmage Necessary”

According To Sutherland

 

Bad weather during the past two
weeks has handicapped the members
of the varsity football squad to such
an extent that but . eight’ full days
have been‘avai1.a.ble for practice ses-
sions. The team, however, has
made the mom of conditions, and
several’ short scrimmage sessions
have been held. .

“Scrimmage is necessary for the
players,” said Jock Sutherland, var-
sity _coach, “for it is only through
it that the players "learn how to
think and. what to do at the right
moment.”. . . -

'9 ‘Scrimmages will dominate the
drills during the remainder. of the
spring training period-whose length
will depend upon weather condi-
tions. ‘ v 9‘

Squad Diminishes .

The size of the squad has dimin-
ished from the 90 which reported
during the ﬁrst week of practice un-
til now but 70 men appear regular-
ly on the ﬁeld. All these men are
expected to stay ‘out forthé re-
mainder of the’ training period.

Captain Eddie Hirshberg has been
shifted from the "right end position

1 which he occupied during the..great-

er part of the last campaign to the
other side-of the line. If. the change
does not affect his play'noticea.bly,
he will probably be at. that post
whenthe team lines up for» its open-
er next season. _ =  .
Pitt‘ will have a lentiful supply
of ends this year. st year,vplay-
ers forthis -position were scarce,
the . condition ‘causing the switching
of Jim MaoMurdo from the tackle
position which he occupied ‘ as a
sophomore to the post left vacant
by Joe Donchess, who completed his

three years of competition the pre- '

vious season. '
MacMurdo At Tackle.

.‘.‘.l‘im will play as a tackle this
year,” .Sutherl.a.nd commented. “He
would have played there last year,
but we were short on ends. This
was proven. in the West Virginia
game, the second of the season,
where Hirshberg and Jim wereoboth
injured and we had to struggle
along for the next two weeks with
but twoends. ’  »

“I shifted Jim to that position at
the beginning of the season last

yeanbecause. I knew that he could
play that position and because it
would have been hard for him ‘to
adapt himself to that position if he
had had but one week's time in
which to accustom himself to it.

“We are more fortunate -in the
amount ’of material this year. Last
year. we had few ends and few
tack es. This year, we have plenty
of both, and from the outlook at
present, the boys should have a ﬁne
team this fall.”

iThere will be a ﬁght for the full-

back berth this year ‘between Jimmy

Clark, a letterman for the past two
ears; Johnny Luch, heavyweight
inter and star weighty thrower ' on
the track. team, and Dick Matesic,
who played for the Panther year.-
lings last fall.

Luch Tlikes Interest

, Luch is taking more interest in
the sport now than he did during his
ﬁrst two years, in the opinion of
Sutherland.

‘.‘Luch’s case is identical with that
of many college football players,”
said the Pitt coach. “He is show-
ing decided improvement over last
year's form. If he had worked as

ard during his ﬁrst two years as
he is at present, he would easily
be an outstanding player this fall.

1 “Many footbal players. really
don’t ﬁnd out that they love the
game until their junior’ year, and
then they work hard to‘ make up
for the time they lost.

“Luch has a" great I deal to learn
about_ football, but even so, he
should be a valuable member of the
team this‘fal1.”‘

Varsity Riﬂers Take
Eighth In Nationals

Improving its position among oth-
er universities by 11 p1aces,‘the Uni-
versity‘ ﬁnished‘ eighth in the Na-
tional, Intercollegiate I C h a m pion
match for ‘shoulder to shoulder ﬁr-
ing with a total scoreof 1320. The
Pittsburgh team -shot at the Naval
Academy at Annapolis. The Navy
with a score of 1382 ﬁnished in ﬁrst
place. Tying Pitt for eighth place
was Ohio State.

Student ‘0’Neills’ To
Have Their Chance

An opportunity for student play-
wrights is offered with the an-
nouncement of a one-act play con-
test by Theta Alpha Phi, national
dramatic fraternity. The contest is
being conducted by a committee un-
der the direction of John M. St.
Peter, Col. '31, and they, together
with two members of the faculty,
will compose the jury which will
pick the winning play.

The winner will be announced at
the Tap Day ‘exercises. He will oe
awarded a prize of ten dollars. In
addition, the winning play, and per-
haps a few others, will be presented
by the Pitt Players during the next
season.

The plays will be judged on the
basis of originality, probability of
plot, adaptability to presentation,
and appeal. All manuscripts must
be typewritten, double spaced and
on one side of the papers. No play
is to exceed 6,000 words in length.
The author's name is not to be
signed on the manuscript but is to
be placed in an opaque envelope and
fastened to the play; the envelope
is to be sealed. The deadline for
the entrance of plays has been set
for April 24; no play will be con-
sidered after the deadline. Manu-
scripts may be turned in to Miss
Mary Millburn in the office of the
Graduate Manager of Student Ac-
tivities. More than one play may
be submitted by one person.

Confer Here

Dr: Bruce Curry To Discuss
Problems Of Students

 

Pitt's ﬁrst Intercollegiate Student
Conference will be held on campus
April 17, 18 and 19, under the lead-
ership of Dr. Bruce Curry, professor
at Union Theological Seminary. In-
vitations have been extended to

forty colleges of Western Pennsyl-
vania and West Virginia and a num-
ber of delegates are expected from
each school.

Dr. Curry, who is well known as
a speaker on student issues, brings
to the conference a unique contribu-
tion in his interpretation of the life
and character of Jesus and of his
relation, both to speciﬁc and social
attitudes and to campus problems of
college men and women.

Margaret Rodgers, Col. '32, presi-
dent of Y. W. C.'A., says of Bruce
Curry: “He helped me find-a way
of living that "formerly I saw in
others but thought impossible a5 a
vital experience» for myself. He
helped me to distinguish between
imitating the religion of my enlight-
ened friends :and discovering alone
what life with God can mean."

The first session of the conference
will follow a fellowship dinner to
be held Friday evening, April 17, at
the Oakland Methodist Church at 6
o'clock. -The nature of the discus-
sionsfor the sessions will be very
informal, depending on the ques-
tions and problems of the students
concerning the contributions of
Jesus to modern social, economic
and religious problems. The second
session will begin Saturday morning
at 9:30 at Heinz House. Luncheon
will be served at 12:30, after which
a tour will be made of the Cathedral
of Learning. At the close of the
third session scheduled for 2 o'clock
the conference will adjourn for Sat-
urday. On Sunday the fourth ses-
sion will start at 9 o'clock and will
be_followed by church, dinner and
the ﬁnal session at 2 o'clock.

Of the conference which is en-
titled “Life at Its Best," Mr. Wil-
liam Mendenhall, secretary of the
Y. M. C. A., said: -“It will help stu-
dents gain a personal philosophy _of
life "and the principles affecting liv-
ing.” .

i selections for the all-interfra-

past season. ‘Play in the
league was unusually keen this
year, and the selections were
hard to make.

The players who were chosen
on the first teams all had some
previous experience in high
school. and a few of them
played on Pitt freshman teams
in their first year here.

The forwards'chosen were:
Don Davis, Phi Gamma Delta,
and O’dell, Phi Delta Theta.
Davis played on last year's
frosh team, while O’dell was a
leading candidate for this
year's frosh team before he
decided to give up the sport in
order to devote more time to
his studies.

Joe Reichenbach, who scored
the winning points for Kappa
Nu in the ﬁnal game, crashed
through for the center berth in

Religious Discuisionl Club F oiindeli In .l~9.l3;,
Named For Yale Student

_ Robert Williams, Col. '31, president of the Pitkin Club at the Uni-
versity, has recently completed a history of the organization, since its

founding in 1913.

In that year, several students, inspired by attendance

9

at a Student Volunteer Conference in Kansas City, decided_ to ﬁound at '
Pittsburgh a religious group for open discussions like those of the con-

ference.

This original group planned to meet weekly at the Shadyside Pres-

byterian Church with students fromv

the University, to discuss religious
problems, including missionary work
Founders of the club asked Dr.
Hugh Thompson Kerr, pastor of the
Shadyside Presbyterian Church, to
conduct the discussion groups. The
organization chose as its name that
of’ Horace Pitkin, a Yale student,
who was killed in the Boxer Re-
bellion in 1900.

From this beginning as a student
religious organization, it has devel-
oped until today it comprises a cen-
tral organization, which still meets
at the Shadyside Presbyterian
Church; a branch at Centre College
in Kentucky; another at the Univer-
sity of Knoxville, and still another
chapter, founded by Viers Adams,
former president of the University

of Pittsburgh organization, at the
Junior division at Johnstown.

In the course of its 3‘l'0Wth the '

organization has deviated somewhat
from its original purpose. At its in-
ception the group was primarily a
theological and religious clique, but
today the Pitkin Club is a non-de-
nominational and non-sectarian body
of students assembled for the pur-
pose of a discussion and treatment
of current problems in the light of
religious principles. The club is,
however, still under the expert
guidance of Dr. Hugh Thompson
Kerr, present Moderator of Presby-
terian General Assembly. Dr. Kerr
is assisted in this work by Reverend
Robert Steele, assistant pastor of
the Shadyside Presbyterian Church.
