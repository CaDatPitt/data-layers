etition Campaign Planned

Clofson Selected
l Tap Day Speaker

Student Government president Tom Olofson will serve
as senior speaker for the annual Tap Day dinner, March 13,
chairman Joseph’ Seiger has announced.

“Just as Dr. Wadsworth will speak‘ at the noon ceremony
on leadership from a 'faculty—administrative point of view,
so it has been traditional for a senior speakerhto hit this area

from the student standpoint,"
Seiger remarked.
' Evaluate Role

“Tap Day is not only to honor
the student leaders,” Seiger con-
tinued,” but to evaluate their role

in the University community as
well.” _ .
Olofson, chosen by the Tap
Day committee because “he took
SG and whipped it into some-
thing,” will discuss three as-
pects of this student role.
First, he will examine
“capacity of a student at the Uni-
versity — the role he can play,
where he ﬁts in.” From here, Ol-
ofson will treat the responsibility
of the student to fulﬁll this capa-
city. , H ‘
Proper Perspective
“Through these two points, the

‘ —role of the student can be brought

into proper perspective.’ But this
focusing requires-a’ refutation of
some fallacies about the Univer-
sity, such as some concerning the
trimester system, the administra-
tion, and student _life.”

This refutation will summa- ’

rize the points of his speech.
In a,feature article in the No-
vember 14, 1962 issue of The Pitt
News, Olofson explained his per-
sonal administrative philosophy.
At this time Olofson explained
that the realization that the stu-
dents, faculty, and administration
compose equal constituent groups
at the University and a striving

The proposal, as presented to

tween Fifth and Forbes.
In Schenley Plaza, the meters

adjacant to Forbes Field and in_

the center area will be four hour
meters. All other meters will be
two hour. Meter regulationswill
be in effect between 8 a.m.’ and
6 p.m. on Fifth and Belleﬁeld
Aves., and between 8 a.m. and 9

The report estimated that in-

cost $23,500 —- $7,500 for minor
road improvements and $16,000
for the purchase of approxi-
mately 230 new meters. Rev-
enue collected by the City from
the new meters wil be fun‘-

and the Meter Trust Fund‘.

H. Grant Smith, City Budget
Controller, in response to ques-
tioning, stated that the City could
not legally collect revenue from

parking meters, but he declined.

to differentiate between “reven-
ue” and the money collected from
meter use.

Rankin’s report, which has been
submitted to the Council, is cur-
rently being prepared for im.

but the Council will entertain
public. discussion on the legisla-

for excellence were the founda-
tions of his thinking.
Three Bodies
“Each of these three bodies -—
student, faculty, and administra-
tive — are of equal importance,
and each contributes in a different
way to the total University.”
Olofson attributed weak stu-
dent government and individual
student apathy to a misconcep-
tion of this role. “Either the
students don’t realize that they
have this responsibility to the
school or they don’t care to take
on this responsible role.
He applied this indifference or

inaction to people “setting their’

objectives too low. The only way
to accomplish anything is to fol-
low the thinking of Robert
Browning,” Olofson proposes: ‘a
man's reach must exceed his
grasp.’
Optimum Goals

“People must set optimurr
goals, and they must make a con-
certed ‘effort to -reach them. But

‘The Dock Brief’ and ‘The Rootabaga Story’

T Itea tre I 1PlansPlay, Opera

“The Dock Brief,” by John
Mortimer, and “The Rooter-
baga Story,” a one—act opera
by VVilfrid Mellers, Mellon
Professorjof Music, will be
presented by Theatre II, April
3, 4.,‘ and 5, according to John H.
Ull‘1Ch, director of the University
Theatre.

“The Dock Brief is a delight-
ful.English comedy,” said Gil
Lazier, a graduate student in
speech and theatre arts who will
direct the play. “It takes place
in a cell and it’ deals with the
case of a man who was con-
victed of killing his wife. Hetis

defended by a blustering, ancient

English barrester.”

It is a contemporary play with
only two people in the cast, ac-
cording to Lazier. “The play was
originally a radio play. It was
so sucessful that it was made
into a TV play and then a stage
play. I doubt if it ever appeared
on Broadway.”

Presents Reversal

“Mortimer presents an almost
complete reversal of values,” La-
zier continued. “The accused is
very nice, while the barrister is
blustering and has never pleaded
or won a case.”

The two members of the cast
keep reacting the court room
scenes in the cell. The trial is
never. seen. /There are props
used in the cell to represent
the jury and judge’s bench.

Through his music, Professor
Mellers has intensiﬁed the basic
children’s story written by Carl
Sandburg, according to Ulrich.‘

Forum Series Slates

Agnosticism Panel

The Student Union Forum Series will“ present a ‘panel
discussion on ‘-‘Agnosticism: A C-ampus'Cu1tivation”_this com-
ing Monday at 3 p.m. ‘in’ the SU Supper Room.

The panel members for the discussion will include Dr.

Roy Heath, Rabbi Richard Rubenstein,‘ Gary Lincoﬁ and
Rose-Billie Hoffman. Two other panel members will be

named later. 9

Purpose of Discussion
According to Martha Holstein‘,
publicity chairman for, the, SU

Forum Series, “the purpose of,

the discussion. is not to pass mor-
al judgement’ on» the beneﬁt or
detriment of agnosticism to the
individual, but rather to analyze
a situation which exists here at
the University and most pro-

bably on other college campuses”,

The Forum will also try to
investigate how 7 “a student’s
moral values are »modiﬁed or
destroyed through his exposure
to a variety of people —— fac-
ulty, other students "—— aswell

’_ as to his course‘ _material -‘-'

literature and lectures.
“A student’s traditionally-or-

'iented value system is _shaken;

often so is the _whole student.
He may then build a new value
system or replace his, old one

’ with nothing. In" either case, he _

' is continually seeking some man-j
'ner,of solving his dilemma” added
Miss Holstein.

V _ Shed Light
Tom Mellers, "chairman of the

_ Forum Series,_ feels that the pur-

pose of the program is “to shed
light on the existing problem and
to offer possible‘ solutions.f' I .

“The panel will strive for a
psychological approach /to the
problem rather than a philo-
sophical one. But the conﬁnes
of the discussion do not indi-
cate‘ that the problem of
changing value systems does
._-not exist in othenareas as well.
Politically and.-socially the stu-
dent is ‘confronted with ‘new
values, new choices,’ and new

Pittsburgh City Council will soonconsidera proposal

   

for‘ University students and personnel.

The proposal, whose backers include the owner of six I

Oakland parking lots,‘calls for the ins'tallation,of parking
meters in the Cathedral district, areas upon which students

. depend most for present parking. If the‘ proposal becomes

law, any student who spends more than two to four hours

~ "at school will be forced to rent space in a ‘public lot.

" The University recognizes the parking problemiin Oak-

the near future. Students who are concerned about the sit-

V’-The City Fathers are willing to hear all sides of the

In addition to expressing opinion, however, the petition

problem and requests that more consideration be given to
the University parking area before a decision to install me-

It is felt that these parking areas are presently being
shared by students and faculty members and by people who

the fact that‘ they can park for free while traveling into

I other parts of town. This has been substantiated by mem-

bers of the committee who originated the meter "proposal.
It is further felt that, reserving the parking areas for those
who have legitimate reasons for parking there for long

, periods is more advisable than limiting all parkers. This’
has been done in other cities and could be carried out in I

Pittsburgh. ,

HUAC and Communism

One of the most ditﬁcult dilemmas in American
politics is the Communist Party and its fellow-
travelers. To ﬁght subversion at home the House
Un=American ActivitiesVCommittee has subpoenaed
hundreds of-witnesses and com-
piled thousands of pages of tes-
timony. The most recent hoopla
over the Committee dealt with
the Women’s Strike for Peace,’
where housewives were a-ccused
of ‘harboring __ Communists in
organization. The ,open
hostility on the part of." the
women threw the Committeemen
for a loop and they were really
unable to get an solid, tangible.
information out of the witnesses. ,

.More important than the lack of information
was the public reaction to the whole affair. Tele-
vision commentators thought the whole business to
be rather humorous and most of the press indirect-
ly sided with the women. I think this stems from:
one, the declining inﬂuence of the HUAC on public
opinion; and two, a growing public sophistication
that will not tolerate a repeat of the McCarthy
Era’s excesses. ‘

ACLU Leads Fight «

Leading theﬁght against HUAC has been the
American Civil Liberties Union, an organization
dedicated to the maintenance of civil rights and
the Bill of Rights. The ACLU sides with the state-
ment of Thomas Jefferson which reads, “... . Truth
is great and will prevail if left to herself; she is
the proper and sufficient antagonist toerror, and
has nothing to fear from thelconﬂict unless by
human interposition disarmed of her natural weap-
ons, free argument and debate; . . .” ‘

Why, then,’ does the House Committee exist?

Basically because of the threat Communism oﬁers”

internally to the United’, States, and also because

the Communist Party offers a paradox in American"

jurisprudence unlike ‘any other. This pa'radox"is
the fact thatan organization ‘dedicated to-the—_over..

can jurists stems from this dilemma: are these sub-
verters to be granted the equal protection of the
laws? _ ,

It was partly to ease this frustration and partly
to examine the extent‘ of Communist subversion
that the-HUAC became an important political insti-
tution.

mellowed by time and a decreasing public ap-
proval, HUAC has turned to more intellectual pur-
suits, as in the ‘movie -“Operation Abolition.”

‘Criticism of HUAC has increased since the
Women’s Peace group episode and has centered
around the funds the Committee uses to function.
For 1962 the Committee had $681,000 appropriated
to"it for its staff and operations. Such a large
amount would be justifiable, I think, if the Com-

fects have. been widespread andlong lasting.
Freedom Distorted

The hate, suspicions, and general fear generated
by this Committee have distorted the freedom to
speak out. At the discussion on “Intellectual
Apathy” several weeks ago, this connection be-
tween the “McCarthy 7Era” and student vtimidity
was raised. Although there are other reasons for
student apathy, I think that the fear of punishment
is a’great hindrance to open debate.

I am hopeful that this era of feariand suspicion
is dying out across America. Our greatestvstrength
in comparison=to the Communist world‘is our free-
dom. The openness of our society makes the Cold
War diiﬁcult, but at the sametime is a‘ natural

In truth, the HUAC and the Communist Party
are here very similar. Bothrestrict speech in the

Hi Ed, ’ , , ’
Forgive me if my greeting seems to be a bit
forward, but, after reading your M08093, “T0 Melt
Prejudice” (Feb. 25), I’ve decided to “stop cringing

-' before the "boss man.” No longer will I feel sorry

for myself. . .
Not only that, Ed ole’ pal,‘ but next Pmpgoing to
throw away my shades and Ivy League suits.
How’s that for a start? Do you think that I’m
ready to ﬁght “my” war now? _

Oops! I almost forgot the most important-thing.

By all means, I must discard all of my “diddily-
bop” mannerisms. I’m not exactly sure what they
are,‘ but one thing" certain,’ no more spitting or
teeth—sucking for me. No siree. From now on, I’m
going‘ to swallow my spit just like the white
boys do. *
 See how your informative article has helped
me, .-Eddie? Now I am equipped to go out into the
“white sea” and make contact. And, just like you
said, ole’ buddy, contact is the only way to melt
prejudice. .

Gee, Eddie, you’re bright! Ever since my
shackled ancestors landed on the coast of Virginia,
we have been trying to solve the race problem.
For .400 years we have wrestled with the problem.

Finally, in the middle of the 20th Century, a
Pitt scholar has shown us the light. ‘Honest, Eddie,
your suggestion that we “must learn to stop acting
like the American Negro” is nothing less than a
stroke of genius.

I can’t ‘imagine why this wasn’t thought of be-
fore. Sheer brilliance, that’s exactly what it was.
No doubt, in generations to come, you’ll be ranked
right up there with Lincoln, Einstein, and Schulz
for your contribution to mankind.

Uh, just one question though: how do you pro-
pose that we go about learning not to be Ameri-
can Negroes? Do you think that the University
should offer courses in the subject? If not the Uni-
versity, then maybe the high schools or the grade
schools will teach us how not to be American
Negroes.

Then,‘ after we’ve become thoroughly indoctri-
nated, what will we be —- Italians? No, no, that
would never do, because I’m not too fond of ravioli

x

I know what! We’ll call the‘courseT“7I—Iow to be
Anything But An American ‘Negro..’’ ‘ V “

In this way, We’ll all have a choice, so if I
don’t like ravioli, I can choose to be a Pole, or_ a
Czech, or a Russian, or any damn. thing Iiplease.
How does that -sound, Eddie ole’ buddy? _

Oh shucks, Eddie! I almost forgot something.
Say I learn how to be a good American Scotsman,

i what am I going to do about my skin color? Who

ever heard of ablack Scotsman? This may come
as a surprise to 'you“, ole’ pal, but that damn stuff
just won’t come off‘. ‘ A

I I’ve tried everything: bleaching creams, Lestoil,
and even Brillo pads. The bleaching creams made
me greasy, the Lestoil made me. wet, and those
Brillo pads made me sore as hell.

Why, I was even bleeding in spots. I was going

to use that “New Green Comet,” but I ﬁgured that
a green Scotchman wouldn’t be any more admirable
than a black one.
, And, ‘geed gosh! What about my hair? I don’t
think we could ever straighten that out... Maybe I
should “Process” it. But, then, only “diddily-bops”
do that. What a dilemna. .

So you see, Eddie, by solving one problem,

’you’ve only created many more. But don’t let that

stop you. You just keep right at it. Undoubtedly,
you’re on the right track. . h «

Meanwhile, I suggest that you write JFK and
demand a military escort to and from school every
day. That’ll teach those “diddily—bops” a thing
or two.

library Hours Changed

dent Government committee on li-
brary hours, feels that the “li-
brarians are being quite fair. I
am in agreement with their de-
cision to close it on Friday night.
Although I feel that it would be
advantageous to keep it open
then, it would not be feasible at
this time.”
V ~ Term Paper Time
' During term paper time, Miss
Janos noted, “weekday;-night at-
tendance should be better. At this
time the library will be kept open
during the peak hours. The prob-
lem is finding the peek hours. The
students will have to watch for
themselves to see when it is open.”
The building of a new library
should solve the University’s li-
brary problems, according to
Miss Janos. Like Princeton’s
library, ours will then be open
until 2 a.m. » . .
SG president, Tom Olofson, is
“pleased that the library will be
open on Sundays. The students
showed a definite need for it. The
purpose of the trial period was
to show the. need for better li-

brary -hours. I am not disappoint-,

ed about the other hours simply
because the students did not show
a need for them.”

Olofson, went on to say that “if

there is dissatisfaction on the part‘

of the students, then I will look
into the matter further.” '

‘Pitt News’ Staff and Friends

By NANCY FUCHS

_With cries of “Where’s
Chatham?” 18 students inde-
cisively began to “March
forth on March Third” to
boost intercollegiate friend-
ship and President Kennedy’s
physical ﬁtness program. Later
dubbed a “window shopping tour
for the Chancellor,” sponsored by
-The Pitt News, the walking tour
included visits to Chatham Col-
lege, Carnegie Institute of Tech—
nology, Duquesne University and
Mount Mercy College-—a total of
ten and three-quarter miles.

The walkers included: Matthew
Nesvisky, editor-in-chief; Barry
Gross, associate editor, Stan Stein,
managing editor; Matt Swetonic,
news editor, Vijay Jain, produc-
tion' editor; Jacki Katz, feature
editor; Josey Grossman, assistant
news editor, Margie Nichols, pho-
tography editor; Elliot Drexler,
business manager,- and Dick Kan-
trowitz, assistant business man-

ager. Others marching were re-

porters, Marcia Bernstein and
Nancy Fuchs, photographer, Rich
Feit, Jean Kornfeld, Pat Wen-

-- dell, Fran Healy, Gail Yeargers,
-and Willa Mead. Al Koff joined

the group at Carnegie Tech when
Rich Feit left to develop his pic-
tures.

Bivouac At Craig

The Fifth Avenue River run-
ning down the sidewalk on the

right side of the . street became/‘
increasingly more difficult to
forge causing all but their un-
daunted leader and three loyal
subjects to cross the street._A
traitorous cry of “Gross for
Editor” arose, but their leader
took control at the next stone
wall.‘ There, they were warned;
“we are now aproaching Chat-

"121

ham and may have a little diffi-
culty there.”

Proceeding up Woodland River
(otherwise known as Woodland
Road), an observant reporter no-
ticed that Nesvisky and Gross
were the only ones wearing rub-
bers. Said Gross, “You get smart
when you become an editor.”
Being a smart reporter, she did
not ask what happened to the
other editors.

-A Minimum of Brass Bands

At Chatham, the marchers were
disappointed not to see a brass
band. There was not even a wel-
coming party. But a unanimous
thumbs up vote expressed the
group’s wish to buy Chatham any-
way. " ’

Jain pointed out the senior

girls’ dormitory before leaving

Chatham. . '

Leader Nesvisky urged them on
with the cry, “Next stop is Car-
negie Tech, one of our ﬁne in-
stitutions. We’d like to leave it
that way.” TV; pedometer in the
hands of Kantronitz registered
two and ﬁve-eighths miles, and
agohized screams arose, as a bus
went by. Could it be that they
were getting tired already?

Bailing Along ,

Proceeding down Forbes’ Ave-
nue, the group, was attacked by
two ﬁve year olds with snow-
balls; Soon after an eventful
crossing of the Nile—Fair Oake
Street and Wilkins Avenue, the
group ‘arrived at Carnegie Tech.
No welcome party there, either.
As a matter, of fact, most of the
students there were wearing Pitt
jackets. They decided to buy
Skibo Hall and the library‘ any-
way. -

’.Jain pointed out the girls’

dorm.

Four and ﬁve-eighths miles af-
ter zero hour, at the bridge
joining our campus with Carnegie
Tech, leader Nesvisky gave every-
one a chance to turn back. “We’re
in close proximity to our start-
ing point. How many want to
quit?” he asked. The reply: "No-
body!”

Sometime ago used Volkswag-

than brand new ones. That was

when you had to wait 12
months or longer to get a new
one. However, now with in-
creased production ‘facilities
you can get a new VW from
the FACTORY AUTHORIZED
VW dealer almost immediate-
ly. In our ad of February 20,
we said a ’58 VW was $1995, it
should have been $995. May be
not for $1995, but a used or
.new VW is always a bargain -
especially at M. W. Motors.

proceeded down the Boulevard of
the Allies. The marchers‘ proved
their agility by balancing them-
selves on the narrow curb with
Pittsburgh trafﬁc on oneiside and
head—high prickly bushes on the
other .’ '

After slipping down the ice-
coated stirs below the bridge at
Boulevard of the Allies and
Forbes Avenue, the marchers
readjusted their nerves and‘ con-
tinued toward Duquesne. A
woman in a house beside the’
road closedher drapes as soon
as she sam them coming.
Friendly smiles from the weary
marchers (maybe they looked

,more like grimaces) received

only cold stares from the peo-
ple in front of their houses.

After seven and three-quarters
miles, they reached Duquesne.
Only ‘one casualty was ‘reported.

"One ofthe marchers was nearly

lost because she insisted on rest-
ing under a headstone in the yard
of a grave monument company.

The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette
writer and photographer cover-
ing the walk by car met the
group there. After they left, Swe-
tonic was heard to say, “Are

that, the group broke into _a
-chorus of “I’m tired and I wan-
na go more.”

Jain pointed out the girls’
dorms. -

Going up the steps of Rockwell
Hall to get a drink of water, Miss
Nichols made a wonderful dis-
covery, “Look, my legs still go up
and down!”

Take Marcher—Add Water

Five minutes after a drink of
water,_Swetonic regained his lost
energy and prepared to organize
an expedition to scale the cliff
opposite‘ Rockwell Hall with
cries of “Come on, we haven’t
had any excitement yet.” But af-
ter a closer look, Swetonic, Stein,
and Drexler decided they had
had enough excitement.

Leader Nesw‘sky- urged the _

marchers on, exclaiming, “The
‘worst is over, gang.” Gross
disagreed however. “The worst
is tonight and tomorow,”. he
said.

After ten miles the marchers
approached Mount Mercy College
with dragging feet. They were
surprised and pleased to see a
small reception party come out
of the dorms

After the group collapsed in

counted 18 ‘heads. “Subtract 18

University and you got the num-
ber of intelligent people in this
school,” he ﬁgured.

Miss Wendell remarked, “I
think I could do it again.” None
took her up on the offer, however.

Symbolizing the end of the

march, Swetonic handed The Pitt-

News Staﬁ‘ to Nesvisky saying,
“Put it in the closet.” “Until next
year,” Nesvisky added. ‘

DR. ABE LAUFE
“American Musical Comedy”
Lecturer

By MARILYN EIGES

Dr. Abe Laufe’s highly en-
tertaining though somewhat
aimless, lecture on “American
Musical Comedy,” delivered
Monday, was highlighted by
a series of inside anecdotes,
and piano demonstrations.

Speaking on popular miscon-
ceptions of today’s musical ‘com-
edy, Laufe, an associate professor
of English, cited ﬁrst the idea that
“people think if you have a big
song hit, you will have a success-
iul show.

“In all history, only eight songs
have been more important than
the Show.” The major one -

“Smoke‘Gets in Your Eyes,”
which kept the play “Roberta”
from closing after just one week,
after Helen Morgan sang it on
radio.

The second misconception, “if
you have a successful show, ev-
eryone will know the full score.”
To believe this, Laufe played
songs from such shows as “How
To Succeed in Business Without
Really Trying” and “Jamaica,”
which nobody was able to recog-
nize. V

Thirdly, Laufe showed the
falsity of those who state we
have original tunes today in
comparison with the wholesale
song stealing of the 20’s and
- 30’s.

Here, Laufe displayed a vast
knowledge of musical comedy

~ scores as he showed the probable

derivation of numerous works
both past and present from pre-

vious works.

Moonlight and Ohio

A portion of Scheherazade led
to “Night and Day.” The tune to
“Why Did I Ever Leave Ohio,”
shows up in “Moonlight and
Roses.” ‘

On thievery, the theory is to‘
‘borrow enough melody that
will sound familiar, but not en- .
ou,gh that people will recognize
it.’ . ‘ .

Laufe’s fourth theory dealt with

the importance of lyrics, which-

he feels are far superior today,
and the best part of today’s
musicals. “Fiorel1o” and “How to

Succeed in Business" won Pulitzer
Prizes for their lyrics, not “their
music.”

“Showboat” ranked as number
one in Laufe’s estimation, with
“Bill” as its best number. Laufe
prefers the music of the 20’s and
30’s. He is particularly criticalof
Lerner and Lowe, whom he calls
“wonderful thieves.’

More even than a knowledge
of his subject, Laufe displayed
the entertaining patter and

‘, playing of a showman.

The program was sponsoredhby
freshman council.

“It Goes On..."

Litchﬁeld would admit has like-standards—has proven that
a school with a traditional football background can be trans-

» formed into a basketball-minded institution.

The man who most delights in the change is Fritz Crisler,

I  the astute director of Michigan’s huge athleticplant. And he
* was once one of football’s greatest coaches.

Basketball and football have never really existed as close
as Siamese twins in any single school, but it can be done. If
Crisler changed his mind about the sport’s position so can
athletic director Frank Carver, who still prefers football.

Michigan has been turning away crowds this year and

‘: their arena seats 9100. At least 95 per cent of these people

even come early to see the big “M” frosh team.

When it comes to basketball’s comeback of the year,

, Michigan is a shoo-in as a twin-winner — in the stand-

, ings as well as at the box office. Eleven victories in the

ﬁrst 16 games assured the Wolverines the best personal
" "season record in four years. 5

Already therMichigan club is rated the favorite to cham-
>pion the Big Ten circuit next winter’. The Wolverines have

I i , the best freshman team in the league.

Crisler was asked the story behind this sudden as
well as startling revival of basketball at a school where

I I football always has been ‘king. ‘

The more expeditions the salesmen from the Dean of
Men’s Oﬂice make to N ew, York and Philadelphia to recruit
new students the more important a position basketball must
assume here. 0

Basketball attendance in the student section increas-
ed by 3000 a game this winter—2200 showed up for the
ﬁnale against Penn State, and we outdrew Duquesne
University all year.

In order to appease this new breed of student fan, the
school must step up its basketball program. Michigan has laid

‘ a perfect blueprint.

“All the credit belongs to Dave ‘(Coach Strack) and his
two assistants — J im=(Skala) and Tommy (J orgenson) ”, said

i . Crisler. “Our basketball was at a low ebb’ when Dave took

over in 1960. He’s worked like a beaver to build it up as a
recruiter as well as a coach.”

Although football always has been Crisler’s favorite
sport, Fritz proved he’s an all-out thinking athletic di-
V rector~»when he said: '

“I’d like to see the basketball rules committee open up
the defense a wee bit. There’s still. a bit too much whistle in
the game.

“If the defense had as much leeway as it did when I
played at Chicago, we’d have a greater and vastly more ap-
-pealing spectator game. I still say fans don’t buy tickets to
see as many free throws as wehave in some games these
days.” '

Of course, they don’t. They buy them to see top-caliber‘

ball clubs like the one Pitt has and Michigan is fast getting.

Gymnastic Championships Held

Fitzgerald Field House will be
the scene of the National Col-
legiate Athletic\Association Gym-
nastics Championships this year.
The meet will take place on
March 29 and 30. It will bring
together the top college gymnasts
‘in the nation, who will compete
for individual and team honors.

According to Coach Warren
Neiger, the Panthers will send
ﬁve entrants to the prelimi-
naries. They are Ed Zamecnik,
fourth in the Eastern all-
around, Jack Lehner, fourth on
the long horse in the Easterns,

Ed Stim, Roland James, and

Bob Pingatore.

The’ National Championships
will consist of eight events plus
the Olympic all-around. The ev-
ents will be side horse, long horse,
horizontal bar, parallel bars, still
rings tumbling and trampolining.

the Eastern League and are not
contested in Eastern dual meets.

The Eastern stars will have
their main competition "from the
Midwest and Far West. Gymnasts
from these two areas swept all
the honors in last year's Nation-
als at Albuquerque, New Mexico.
Southern California won the team
championship.

An _improvement in perform-
ance by the Easterners is ex-
pected because of the environ-
ment and locale of the meet.
Stars such as Mark Cohn of
Temple, Tom Seward of Penn
State, and Phil Voas of Syra-
cuse will attempt to duplicate
ex-Penn Stater Greg Weiss who
won the Olympic all-around in
1961. .

The outlook is for improvement
by the East and a continual show

brought down the pool and Uni-
versity records in the 100-yard
freestyle to 50 seconds ﬂat in the
ﬁnal meet against Notre Dame.
0 I Hard To Do

,Taking off seconds in short
distance events is very hard to

50-yard freestyle mark by one-
half-a second since the ﬁrst meet

this year, and Ribarchak took
one-and-a-half seconds off his
mark registered in the ﬁrst meet
against Princeton. .

The NCAA record in the 50-
yard sprint is 21.1 seconds set
by Steve Jackman of Minne-
sota. Mike Austin of ,Yale set
the record of 47 seconds in the
100-yard frestyle. Austin won
both events in the Eastern Sea-
board Championships. last year,
posting a time of’ 21.2 in the
50-yard event and a. time of
47.5 in the 100-yard event.

in the sprints,” said co-captain
Rich Rush. “Every meet we had
a potential of scoring 16 points
with them alone."

Both boys strongly impressed

Coach Dennis Stark of Notre‘

Dame. “Those two really can

ﬂy,” he said. “I think they
should be-_ able ' to’ place high
in the Eastern championships.”

Both boys are from Pittsburgh
and Coach Grady is optimistic
about their future here. “Those
two can really move,” he said.
“It’s nice to be able to feel com-
fortable when their races are on
tap. Both of them have been
really dependable.”

Both swimmers have two more
years to become more clock-
conscious and Grady is hoping
that time ticks off a second or
two from their present records.

Ailing, But To
Play in Game

The Panthers begin practic-

ing for their game with NYU 

today under the guidance of
assistant coach Don Hennon.
Coach Bobby Timmons is. in
New York, to scout the Vio-
lets in their game aginst St. John,
tomorrow night.

Before leaving this morning,
Timmons said, “I don’t want my
team thinking they _can’t beat
NYU. I want them going_there

conﬁdent. At ﬁrst they wanted ‘

to go to the NI'_I‘ because they
knew they‘ would draw NYU in
the._ﬁrst round at the Palestra.

"‘But if we can come up with
some kind of
Johnny
Saturday (Fordham defeated

:-

d.

NYU, 71—68),>we_’ll be all right.X
At least the players know that"

NYU can be beaten.”

Generalovich Hurting '

Timmons then doted on Brian
GeneraloVich’s injury. “I didn’t
start the General against Tech
or Miami because they weren’t
key games. He. has been getting
treatments and hasn’t been work-
ing out with the team. His leg
will hurt him as long as he runs.
That bone spur is awful mean.

‘fHe’s going to have togo against -

- NYU. We are going to start him

and we’ll_ need a good game out
of him. You_ can see that Ro-
man is all right ”(he scored 27
agai}1st Miami of Ohio.)’’
_ The 19-5 regular season rec-
ord compiled by the Panther bas-
ketball team was a combination
of many factors.

Five in Doubles

The Panthers’ ,_ ended the‘ sea-.
son .With ﬁve players averaging
‘in double ﬁgures. Dave"Roman-led
the -team with a 14.9 average.

total of 343 points, 16 more than
Generalovich. .

J The_. General was second in
team‘ scoring with a 13.6 aver-
age.

V Ben Jinks, "who started the

‘Y€.ar on the" second team, was
third with 271 points and a 11.3
average.

Sheffield Fourth

substitute guard most of the sea-
son, placed fourth in team scor-
ing with 257 points and a 10.7

The Panthers? big man, Paul
Klfiegfer. has proved to be the
biggest gsurprise of the season.
Krieger averaged 10.6 points a
game and had 255 points. His ,
. .big‘gest. asset to the team was in
' his rebounding‘. The 6-foot-6

redhead grabbed 259 rebounds
for a. 10.8 average.

Not only were the
well balanced team
but their defensive work also
showed a team effort. Coach Bob

by holding their opposition to

Team Gi'venlChance Against Powerful Violets

 
 

Coaches Size Up Common Opponents
Before Panthers’ Engagement With NYU

New ‘York University’s basketball team has been promoted here as a court poweﬁ

that the Panthers must bow to upon approaching mid-court at the initial tip.-"off.
The Pitt News -has polled four Eastern basketball coaches whose teams competed

against both‘NYU and Pitt°

this winter. Their observa-
tions are a ﬁne size-up of the
upcoming action in the ﬁrstround
game of the NCAA -tournament
this Monday in the Philadelphia
Palestra:

JOHNNY BACH, FORDHAM--
“They deserve to play each other.
They’re both bullish, hard-nosed
and l‘ast—moving. It should be a
great game. NYU has a bullish
tendency on the boards and they
are stronger there. Your back-
court is better than theirs.

“Pittsburgh has more of a
team concept, more patterns, a

more organized type of attack.
We played a

_ control game
against NYU (whom they beat
last Saturday, 71-68). We

should have done more of that
against Pitt (who beat Ford-
ham, 87-61). Running with Pitt
weslost heavily. They were the
only team this year that beat,
us so decisively.

“We slowed NYU down and
walked up the floor, but Pitt has
the power to run with them. The
key will be for Pitt 5to contain
(Harold) Hairston. There’s no
answer to (Barry) Kramer. He
rates right up -‘there with «the
greats like (Tom) ..Gola,‘(Dick)
Ricketts, and (Sihugo) Green.- 5

“Kramer can jump like hell.
And he plays 40 minutes of bask-
etball. He uses his arms effectively
when he’s going for the basket.
He has that star status and they
get consideration. 9

“No matter what the outcome,
it’ll be a fan’s delight. I know I’ll
be there.” ‘

HARRY LITWACK, TEMPLE—
“NYU is playing with two poten-

-tial All-A m e r i c a n ballplayers

(Kramer and Hairston). NYU is
very strong and rugged under-
neath, and they’re terriﬁc on de-
fense. I need ﬁve guys to score as

-they didn’t have that

, the boards hard against NYU. But

much as their two big men. You
can ﬁgure them for 50. '

“It isn’t fair to compare Pitt
and NYU off their games with us.
Pitt was below par against us and
(Dave)
Roman in the game. He‘s very
good from outside. He’ll be the
difference. .

“Your team looked very good
when I. scouted them_-against
Westminster. You’ll have to hit

I really think the game_ is a toss-
up.” " p -
GEORGE HUNTER, ARMY ——
“In my mind NYU is probably the
best lI‘l_' the East with Hairston
back (he was ineligible the ﬁrst
half of the season). I’ve seen them
play four times in the Garden.
Ha_irston’s 6-foot-7, 220 pounds,
and he can run like a_deer. He’s a‘
good jumper and a good board-
man.

“And, of course, Kramer is 6-
foot-4 and he can jump like a
kangaroo and dunk with two
hands. He has great spring and
he’s stronger than he was last
year. He had eight points against
us a year ago, and he scored 38
against us this year." A

“He gets them on his own, too.
If you overplay him, he’s liable
to slide by and drive and you’ll
be forced to foul him. He gets on
the foul‘line quite a lot. He’s a
great mover; it's like he was rid-
ing a bicycle all over the court.

“No one else scores much be-
cause they’re ‘always feeding
Kramer and Hairston. Hairston
has bee,n_..averaging better than 30
a game” since he‘ came _back.
They’re good for 60 points be--
tween them. There’s not much
chance for the rest of them to
score. Krafner hit 12 ﬁeld goals
from outside the circle against us.
He pushes off on the backboards
and he. charges, but he’s gotten
away with it.

“They. also have an excellent
backcourt and I would have to
give them the edge over Roman
and (Cal) Sheffield.

“I think you’ve got a great ball
game to play to beat them. We
played our ﬁnest game of the year
against Pitt and they still beat us.
You can beat them- They’re not
unbeatable. '

“They’re frontrunners, and it’s
tougher than hell to catch them.
But if you’re playing good per-
centage ball and holding them
tight, they’ll throw the ball up.
We’ll be rooting for you.”

RED MANNING, DUQUESNE—
“They’re stronger physically than
Pitt. They’re more deliberate than

Pitt which runs more. They al-

ways try to set up their best men
just like they used to do with
Tom Sanders. _

“You have more outside shoot-
ing Pbwer. Their outside shoot-

' irrr is just average. They have a

weak bench .and you have the
edge there.

“You let Kramer get the ball
and he’s trouble. We went out
and picked them up ‘at mid—court
so they c_ouldn’t work the ball as
well. We didn’t want Kramer in
close where he’ll score.

“He’s always moving toward
the hoop when he’s shooting.

He, makes Contact most of the
time. If-the refs call them right

‘on Kramer he can foul out. He

had three on us in the ﬁrst half.
He fouled out against us after
scoring 23, but he’s the best I’ve
seen all year.

“But no one is invincible
against Pitt. Neither NYU or
Duke.” -—By JIM O’BRIEN

Here’s the way we see the Eastern Intercollegiate Wrest-
ling championships this weekend with Pitt’s entry listed first:

123-pounds--Duff Killian — Defending champion Bill
Merriam of Lehigh is the favorite, but he could be beaten
by Terry Haise of Syracuse, who has already done it‘. Fred
Crawford of Navy will challenge. Killian, untested, but

touted, could surprise.
130-pounds — Mike Johnson.
The returning champion and run-

nerup, Pat Smartt of Lehigh and '

Denny Earrar of Navy, respec-
tively, are not even among the
in this talent-loaded

of the lot, but will be stiffly

challenged by Bethel Greenhalgh 
of Syracuse and Bob Haney of.
Penn State. Despite three dual-

meet losses, Smartt will be very
troublesome.

137-pounds — Frank O’Korn.
Navy's Mike Harman returns to

" defend his title after his second
straight undefeated season. Jim,
t is .his top .
' challenger. O’Korn could place.

Murrin of Syracuse

147-pounds —— John Carr. Carr
could win it all, but won’t be the

favorite. That role falls to’ Na-

tional champion Mike Natvig, who
is seeking his ﬁrst Eastern title.
Unbeaten .,_George Edwards of
Penn State could also win.

157-pounds —— Tim Gay. Kirk

- Pendleton is all alone in this class.

If anyone lasts the full nine min-
utes with him it will be an ac-
complishment. Pete Cummings of
Cornell and Dave Steiler of Tem-
ple could place. So could Gay if
he gets a break in the drawing.
1671-pounds Jim Harrison.
Syracuse’s Gary Sirota and Har-
rison are likely to meet in the

.._.

ﬁnals. Prior to their draw this
year, Harrison beat Sirota three
times. He will. continue that
mastery.

177-pounds —- Ken Barr. It

A * took. a great performer, Jim De-

trixhe, to keep Barr from the
title last year. Unless he is weak

. from the drop in weight, the title

should be his."Denny Focht, seed-
ed ﬁrst at 191-pounds last year,
looms as his stiffest challenger.
Lew Roberts of Syracuse and
John Gladdish of Lehigh should
place.

_ 191-pounds -- Lee Britton.

beaten sophomore, looks like the

best in this fairly strong division.
Ed Pohland of Penn State and last
year’s runnerup, Ray Nickla of
Army are Everling’s biggest com-
petition. Bob Rader of Rutgers is
a darkhorse. Britton has little
chance of doing much.
Heavyweight -— Jeff Ware. Jim
Nance of Syracuse could be the
next Pendleton of the.East. He
sems to be unbeatable. Ed Schar-
er, the defending titlist from Rut-
gers, has the best chance for an
upset. Lehigh’s John Illengwarth,
if recuperated from an injury,
will challenge Scharer for second.
Ware could place since the com-
petition past these three is not
strong.
FIVE or THE eight opponents
that the Panther wrestling team
.met this. winter were rated in
the Top Ten‘ in the country in
pre-season polls.

tiered Matmen Seek Eastern Title;

Three New Faces Enter ‘Wrestling Lineup;

Ken Barr Drops Down Witli Lee Hall liijnred

By BOB SMIZIK

Coach Rex Peery will take a widely revamped lineup to the 59th annual Eastern
Intercollegiate Wrestling Association tournam ent at Navy Friday and Saturday.
Three regulars are out of the lineup, three newcomers have been added and two

other regulars have changed their
weights.

One of the changes occurred,
when 177-pound sophomore Lee’

Hall was discovered to have bone
chips in his leg. It was originally

‘thought to ‘be a ligament strain.

The injury occurred in the Penn
State match and Hall had been
walking around for six days with
the injury. He was operated on

successfully Monday morning but, 

of course, will be out for the
remainder of the season.
Barr Moves Down
With Hall out of the lineup,
Ken Barr will assume the 177-
pound spot that he successfully
handled last year. Replacing Barr
at 191 pounds will be Lee Britton,
a sophomore‘ with no previous
varsity experience.

Tom Henilf lost his 123-pound
starting job to Duff Killian.
Heniff had handled Killian all
season long in challenge match-
es; but last week Killian was
victorious twice to take over the
regular’s spot for Easterns.

Killian lost his only varsity ap-
pearance to Bill .Merrianm this
year, but was second in the 1961
Wilkes Tournament and fourth in
the 1962 Pan-American game
trials.

Baily Benched

John. Carr will drop down one
weight class and wrestle in the
147-pound division sending Tom
Baily to the bench. The 157 -pound
spot will be taken over by Tim
Gay, who alsohhas no varsity ex-
perience, but _who was Eastern
Freshman champion in 1961.

The rest of the lineup is un-
changed with Mike Johnson at
130, Frank O’Korn at 137, Jim
Harrison at 167 and Jeff Ware
at heavyweight.

This lineup has given Peery no

great causefor optimism,» but he is’
and ‘

not pessimistic. ,, “Syracuse
Lehigh are the teams to beat,” he
said. “Navy just might sneak in
there too. Our chances depend a
great deal on how our boys are

seeded and how’ the drawing
goes.” ‘
Eight Seeded

Eight wrestlers are seeded in
each division.vIt is doubtful if
Killiam, Gay or Britton will be
seeded. If one of these should
meet the top—seeded wrestler in
the firstround and lose, he would
lose any chance for advancement
points. But if they meet the
eighth seeded’ wrestler, the
chances of picking up an ad-
vancement point and placing are
far greater.

Panthers who will be seeded‘
are Johnson, Carr, Harrison and
Barr and possibly O’Korn and
Ware. Johnson will probably be
seeded second behind Bob

‘Haney of Penn State, Carr
should be somewhere in the top
four, Harrison will be ﬁrst or
second and Barr anywhere from
one to four.

If O’Korn and Ware are seeded‘

it will be in the lower four.

There are ﬁve. champions re-
turning from last year to block
the Panther’s chances. Out to keep
their titles are Bill Merriam, 123,
Pat Smartt, 130, Mike Harman,
137, Kirk Pendleton, "$1.57 and Ed
Scharer, heavyweight.

This is one of the few tour-
naments in which the Panthers
have -not‘ had a defending
titlist. ' V '

either, but'still rules as favorite

on the basis of their well balanced

team. Lehigh will be hurt some-
what if heavyweight John Illeng-
warth is not recuperated from an
injury he sustained against Pitt.
The Panthers need a few

breaks, ‘like in the seedings, if
they are to capture their ﬁrst
titlesince 1960.

‘Mix

Feels Effectiveness
Would Improve If
He Played More

By ART FLEISCHNER.

Several Eastern basketball
coaches have said that be— ;-

‘catise of Pitt’s bench strength,
they have a good‘ chance
against New York University
in the upcoming NCAA tour-
nament. Much of this reserve
strength is supplied by Dave
Sauer. ’

The 6-foot—3,
ward from‘ Avonworth, Pa., has
been used this "season to spell
Ben Jinks and Brian Generalo-
vich. He has started the last‘
three games for the Panthers,
scoring 17 points against Car-
negie Tech, his highest produc-
tion of the year. '

Sauer, who is a Physical Edu-
cation major with a 2.76 QPA,
explains his substitute role this
way: “I know_I can play better
if I’m playing regularly. It’s
tough to come off the bench and
play good ball all the time. That’s'
why l’ve been pl’.-iying inconsis-
tently this year.”

« Late Tonic

Although he may onlyscore
six or seven points. a game, it
could be just what the team

. needs. Many times this year Sauer

has come offthe bench and tossed
in three quick baskets.

Coach Béb Timmons says of
Sauer: ‘A team needs someone
to , spark them when they’re
slowing down. Dave has been
especially valuable to us this
year because we’ve run into’ a.
zone defense so often. .

“Dave will come off the bench
and throw in two or three long
one-handers and the defense will

‘ have to loosen up. That will give

our other men a better chance
to. score.”
Rebounding ' Improves’

“My rebound has improved this
year, but I still have to ,work' on
my driving,” Sauer said. A lot. of
times the opposition is keying
to my outside shot.

“Lots of times when I come
into the game, I'm cold. It’s
usually from sitting on the.
bench in some cold gym. Some-
times I wonder how I’m able to
hit so well after "siting on the
bench for so long. Maybe the
game is ‘usually , close when: I,
come in, and I like playing un-
der pressure.’

His reserve role this season
has proved invaluable in putting
Pitt intogthe NCAA tournament.
But the Panthers still have one
game remaining and chances are
that Coach Bob Timmons will..go
to ‘This bench more than once
against NYU this Monday. J

It's how 'a.fact= every Ford-built car in '63 has self-adjusting brakes

“Give us a brake,”.Ford Motor Company engineers were told, "that v
will -automatically compensate for lining wear whenever an adjustment
is needed,-and make -it work for the entire life of the lining.”,

Tough assignment—b_ut not ihsurmountable. Today, not only does

Final” Stage Of Tumor

VBy JANET FULLER
Cancer is only the ﬁnal step

in the developmental process.

of a tumor, ac"cording.to Dr.
Harry S.N. Greene, Anthony
N. Brady professor of Patho-
logy and chairman of Patho-
ology at the Yale University Med-
ical School. Speaking on “Met—
astasis,” Dr. Greene addressed
the annual meeting of the Alpha
Omega Alpha honorary medical
fraternity Feb. 26 at Scaife Hall.

Metastasis, or the spreading of

‘cells of a malignant growth to

another, unrelated part of the
body, is not a property of the
tumor from inception, but the
most dramatic in a series of
changes.

Two Stages ‘

“The process of development is
into two stages,” Dr.
Greene explained. “In the ﬁrst, or
dependent phase, the tumor is
reliant on the speciﬁc environ-
mental conditions of the host,
and in the second, the autonomous
phase, the growth will ﬂourish
in another host environment and
metastasis will occur. Autonomy
and the ability to metastasize
coincide and are related.”

Despite theories to the con-
trary, Dr. Greene has proved
that human tumors will grow
when transferred to other species
and to normal individuals. Some
scientists felt that the growths
would regress when vascu1ari-
zation, or the infecting of the
circulatory s y s t e m, occurred,
but they do not. When implant-
ed after metastasis, they will
become truly functional trans-
fers. Therc is a much higher

The University’s Skyscraper
Squadron and Kent State Uni-
versity’s Squadron will host the
Arnold Air Society Mid East Re-
gional Conclave which will con-
vene on March 15 at the Pitts-
burgh Hilton. Delegates from
over forty Arnold Air Squadron
will attend.

Seven University Air Force of-
ﬁcers are members of the Con-
clave staff. They are AAS C/Lt.
Colonel Paul W. Schmid, Conclave
Chairman; AAS C/Major Donald
K. Pollinger, Exhibition Chair-
man; AAS C/Major Luke J. Gill,
Transportation Chairman; AAS

C/Major Robert J. Tate, Publicity '

Chairman; AAS C/Major David P.
Lukcic, Finance Chairman; AAS
C/Lt. Colonel Ronald W. Hasek,
Drill Team Co-ordinator; and
AAS C/Colonel Dennis G. Star-
rett, Area E-1 Commander.

Highlights of the Conclave in-
clude a Cadet mixer on Friday
night in the Hilton Grand Ball-
room. Lt. General James E.
Briggs, Commander of the Air
Training Command, will be the
principle speaker at the Awards
Banquet on Saturday. Educa-
tional seminars will also be con-
ducted on Saturday.

On Saturday evening, the Mili-
tary Ball will be held. The AAS
squadrons and Angel Flights of
the Mid Eastern United States
will compete in the annual drill
meets on Sunday.

death rate‘ among hetero-trans-
plants, though.

Dr. Greene pointed out that
“not all tissues heterogeneously
transplanted are metastatic.” He
found that embryonic human lung
at three months of development
will grow when transplanted,
and that embryonic brain tissue
will live and give oif waves when
implanted in the eye of a rabbit.

Host Must Participate

In cancer, though, “no phases
of development occur without
host participation, and the devel-

opment of metastasis can be in-

ﬂuenced by a number of host
factors,” said Dr, Greene. The age
of the animal is related, for in-
vasion is modiﬁed, or slowed
down, in older animals. Also, the
strain of animal used and the
