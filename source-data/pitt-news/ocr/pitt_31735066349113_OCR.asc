WPGH Sets
Programing

Schedule

By EDWARD PECHAN
WPGH, the campus radio
station, has started broad-
casting operations for this
year with a format to in-
clude a balanced program
schedule of music, news, and con-
tent programs. ,

This trimester, WPGH is oper-
ating with new transmitters
which will broadcast to Towers
A, B, and C, the Quadrangle,
and the University-Presbyterian
Nurses Residence.

Many changes have been ef-
fected at WPGH since last year.
Among them are the increased
power, an enlarged staff of over
50 students, an expanded cam-
pus news department, and a new
series of content programs.

Programing

Regular music programs will "

feature rock and roll, dinner mu-
sic which will be played in the
Towers cafeterias, folk music,
classical music, jazz, and operas.
Content shows will feature Stu-
dent Government reports, reports
from the NAACP, radio dramas
starring the Pitt Players, a Hill
Educational Project show, and
regularly broadcast interview
shows.

The station, which broadcasts
on a -frequency of 650 kilo-

cycles on the AM band, is ten- «

tatively broadcasting from 3:30
p.m. to "midnight on weekdays,
and from 1:00 p.m. to 1:00 am.
on Saturdays and Sundays.
According to David Narr, gen-
eral manager, the station has
been plagued by ﬁnancial diffi-
culties due to the high cost of the
technical equipment needed to
operate the station. However, he
hopes to solve some of the diffi-

-culties by selling the University

Blotter this year.

The goals of WPGH .are:, to
have faculty and student involve-
ment in the station; to serve as a
focal point for the different
views on campus; to serve as a
cohesive force on campus, and to
serve as a means of communica-
tion between the various groups
on campus.

Farmer Expresses
Views to Reporter

. By LARRY BERNFELD
James_ Farmer i‘s a soft-spoken man. You wouldn’t

know} it listening to his powerful baritone as he lectures ‘
The sound of “Uhuru, Uhuru, Uhuru

. . . freedom, free-

dom, freedom” rang out and captivated his Midday audi-
ence. Yet less than an hour before, he seemed a different

man.

Sitting in an easy chair on the ﬁfth floor of the Student Union,
Farmer looked tired yet alert. After a tight, pressing schedule of
news conferences and radio shows, this was just one more interview.
' His tone was quiet, relaxed. But his words lost none of their
impact. His comments were pointed, his criticisms, stinging. James
Farmer is an important man. He is the director of the Congress of

Racial Equ.ality—CORE.
CORE Credo

When Farmer organized the
ﬁrst CORE chapter in 1942, their
credo was “to substitute bodies
for exhortation.” This remains
their technique today. Farmer
feels the non-violence and the
mass movement are the most
widely-used and most popular
techniques in the civil rights
struggle.

CORE, he said, is opposed to
riots. It will “try to prevent
them before they begin, try
to stop them after they sta .”
Riots, he feels, “are a sum-
mer phenomenon. People are
in the streets; they throw bot-
tles and bricks when it is too
hot in the apartment. I‘ don't
look for further spread of riots
this season, except possibly in
the south this fall where the
weather is sufficiently warm.”

Civil Rights Leader
Speaks At Midday 

Urging “all men, white and black, to join in the most‘ S 

exciting crusade in recent history, the civil rights move-

ment,” James Farmer, national Director of the Congress
of Racial Equality (CORE) opened the fall Student Union

Board Midday Series last Wednesday.

Dr. Shepherd L. Witman, Director of the University
Office of Cultural and Educational Exchange, introduced
Farmer to an overflow crowd of 750 in the Student Union
Ballroom as “one of the few men privileged to lead o-u
society to change.” -

Admitting that he was “talking without a subject,”

Farmer told the audience that “the civil rights revolution

is part two of the American Revolution” and that now “the Negro 

is ﬁghting for inclusion in that compact of liberty.”
' Negroes Not Happy

’ Formerly people felt that the civil rights. problem “was solving
itself in the South and didn’t exist in the North,” But Farmer said
that 1-960 w.as “a tough year for Uncle Tom.” Nineteen hundred and
sixty showed that “the Negro never really accepted second class citi-
zenship and that nothing could be further from the truth that Ne-
groes were happy.”

Farmer cited three things as having been the impetus behind
the Negro revolution. First he felt World War All was a time when
the Negro youth was ﬁghting Hitler’s idea of the master race and
faced with segregation in his own country, he began to wonder
“why not ﬁght the idea of a master race at home?”

Second Farmer explained “the increasing education of our
(Negro) youth” helped give rise to the civil rights revolt. “The Bible
and a college education make a difference.” S

Africa Helps 4

The emerging African nations were a similar force. Farmer said
the American Negro, formerly a people without a heritage began to
look to Africa with a new sense of pride, dignity and belonging.”

Annual State of the Union Message

Marcuse Presents Report

By LUCY CORRENTI

Michael Marcuse, Chairman of the Student Union Board, delivered his annual
State of the Union report Wednesday evening before an audience composed mostly of
studnts and administrators connected closely withthe S.U.

_Marcuse opened his address, which centered on a theme of outstanding achieve-
ment in the face of inadequate facilities, by asking his audience to imagine them- .

selves deeply concerned about the happenings in the Student Union.
He outlined the four purposes of a college uion as being (1) to serve as “the

community center of the college,
for all members of the college
family,” (2) to become “the liv-
ing room of the college, providing
daily needs and informal associa-
tion outside the classroom for
the college family,” (3) to serve
as a vital part of the college
education program, serving as a
“laboratory of citizenship, train-
ing students in social responsi-
bility, and for leadership in our
democracy and providing a cul-
tural, social and international
program,” and (4) to. serve as
a “unifying force in the life of
the college.” '

Marcuse then cited some of the
speciﬁc program achievements of
the Union, noting especially the
widely coupled Midday Series and
the vital role the University’s
student Union will play in the
conference of the Association of
College Unions,‘ which will take

1'15!’

  an Rights Leader

 

Speaks At Midday

(Continued from Page 1)
of schools “helped set the stage for the revolt of the sixties,”
according to Farmer. “For the ﬁrst time a branch of the federal
government had declared segregation illegal.

In summarizing his beliefs, Farmer quoted the words spoken by
a young civil rights worker, while in critical condition, on a hospital
bed: “We’ll take kicking, we’ll take spitting, we’ll even take death;
but we’ll keep on coming.” _

I At the end of the speech the audience gave Farmer a standing
ovation.
Coffee Hour

CORE director Farmer discussed more speciﬁc points concerning
the civil rights movement at the coffee hour at 3 p.m. in the Student
Union lower lounge. Farmer commented after the coffee hour that he
had never encountered a University audience which showed greater
depth of understanding in the civil rights issue.

When asked if he felt college students working for civil rights
were fair weather friends who would desert the civil rights move-
ment in a few years he gave a deﬁnite “no.” “I -am convinced of
the level of committment and dedication of college students work-
ing in the South.” ’
ing in the South. They are risking to much to be otherwise.”

On the matter of busing Negro children to predominately white
schools, Farmer said he doesn’t feel that it is bad for Negro children
to see other children growing up with better economic opportunities.
“Public schools are valuable tools in cutting .across class and race
lines. It shows Negro children their similarities with whites. To have
a handful of Negro children in a white school is bad. That’s why we
ﬁght defactor segregation.” . ,

‘ Harlem Shooting

Farmer laughed at a description‘ given by -Policeman Gilligan
concerning his shooting recently of Harlem teenager James Powell.
Farmer stated that CORE had “22 or 23 eye witnesses to the shooting
and their testimony wasn’t even mentioned "in the grand jury report.”
Describing Powell as “a kid who went to church regularly,” Farmer
said all the CORE witnesses agreed Powell had never drawn a knife

 

 
 

on Gilligan, as the policeman claimed. .

Farmer said he had been told Gilligan shot Powell while the
youth walked towards him hands in the air, signifying surrender.
Once Powell had fallen Gilligan kicked him in the head several
times with his foot “to see if he was dead yet.”

Farmer Expresses Opinions
On Riots and Black Muslims

In Exclusive News Interview

(Continued from Page 1)
Rioting moved westward this
summer, from New York to Phil-
adelphia. «Some feel that this city
may be a mob target in the near

- future. Farmer reproaches such

speculation, stating that “there is
no substance to the Pittsburgh
riot rumors.”

CORE is interracial, integrated,
and non-violent. The Black Mus-
lims, an extremist group central
to the Harlem riots, Farmer char-
acterized as “all black, segregated
and they do not reject violence as
a possible fonn of action.” The
two groups disagree on methods
and objectives, but the leaders
nonetheless maintain contact. '

CORE is actively paricpat-
ing in voter registration drives.
Following organization policy,
CORE has not issued formal en-
dorsement to either presidential
candidate. Farmer, feels, how-
ever, that the registration of 13,-
000 new Negro voters in Pitts-
burgh alone is indicative of
CORE’s unwritten support for
President Johnson.

Goldwater Win Disastrous

“A Goldwater victory would be
disastrous,” Farmer continued.
One would see “demonstrations
multiplying and increases in vio-
lence on both sides.”

“His many outrageous state-
ments have encouraged ex-
tremism. I can hear the White

Citizens Council and the Ku
Klux Klan applauding now;
they think they’re defending
liberty.” ’

Goldwater, he feels, “is active-
ly trying to encourage white
backlas .” Farmer doesn't feel
that this factor will rank as im-

portant as predicted in the up-_

coming election. Though a poll
of New York voters recently had
shown that many felt the civil
rights movement was moving too
fast, is also counted the "vote
“overwhelmingly” for Johnson.

Interviews Set

For Seniors

The University Placement Serv-
ice will hold a brieﬁng session
on October 5 in 219 Schenley
Hall to help students "graduating
in December or Apriliwho are
about to plan their careers.

At the session, reprentatives of
various companies will speak to
students and arrange for individ-
ual conferences with them for the
week of October 29.

Placement head Dr. Walter Rit-
enour said that the service has
successfully placed approximate-
ly 50 per cent of its Liberal Arts
graduates and over 90 per cent of
graduates from the‘ School. of

place here in October.

_ But, Marcuse continued, “to adequately accomplish the many
goals of a University community center, a Union has to present
a facility as well as an outstanding program. A successful Union
must provide extensive lounge space . . . places where relaxed
and informal conversation can occur . . . places for students and
faculty to confront each other outside the classroom . . . lounges
for relaxation and study . . . a music lounge . . . an auditorium
ballroom, snack bars, cafeterias, student offices . . . a book store
where the emphasis is on books and supplies at the least expen-
sive prices . . . and extensive recreational facilities.”

. According to Marcuse, the present Union is handicapped in this
need to present a facility, because of its poorly equipped and crowded
offices, lounges, and dining facilities.

Primary Solution _

Citing Paul Goodman’s “The Deadly Halls of Ivy” and a recent

article in Intercollegian magazine satirizing the loss of educational
ideals and lowering of standards in our Universities, Marcuse stated
the belief that a more adequate University center provides one of
the primary solutions to. this problem.

Quoting Chancellor Litchﬁeld’s statement that “The University

must also be concerned with his (the student’s) personal values, his .

social attitudes, his emotional maturity,” Marcuse declared that an
“essential ingredient” in the fulﬁllment of this ideal is a “large, and
totally adequate University Center.” ‘

Marcuse concluded his statement of the Union’s needs and ac-
complishments with praise of the achievements of organizations which
have had to cope with inadequate facilities, and a plea for a new
University center to be included in the University’s plans for further
expansion and development.

Editorial: Tangible Plans’ "oi union Phiilosophy     

Student Union Board Chairman Mike Marcuse delivered his State

L of the Union Report to a handful of people, smaller yet if you subtract .
9. the Board members themselves and The Pitt News representatives. For

some reason, students will show up en masse to hear James Farmer but

 ’ not for something like this. They are more than willing to share in the
» product, but would rather skip the philosophy.

This was unfortunate Wednesday night especially, because Mar-.
 ,cuse’s talk concerned the very people who weren’t there—the students’

activities on campus, the students’ development as a result of their
activities, the students’ Union.

He‘ quoted from a. facetious letter in the Intercollegian written
to a fictitious college freshman from a fictitious admissions director.
In part it reads, concerning the college catalogue, “We used to talk about
such goals as ‘sound learning,’ ‘rich and responsible personal lives,’ and
‘useful citizenship.’ Due to cultural lag, we haven’t removed from the
printed pages what we no longer talk about. When we do, the catalogue

 

   

distributed over several ﬁelds. Our simple aim is to bestow the economic
asset of a degree on everyone we can crowd in.

Marcuse exclaimed that this is not the type of experience we
should allow to win out at this university. The student organizations
are making great strides in Union facilities which have become insuffi-
cient with the recent boom of student activity. You can provide out-

standing programs, he concluded, but you must have adequate physical
facilities to be genuinely successful.

The administration is becoming increasingly aware of the ﬁfth
goal the Chancellor set forth in his inaugural address—the development
of the student as a whole person. The inclusion of student leadership
in the Student Affairs area has certainly been a step in this direction,
but more than anything else this is to promote a philosophy, 2. philoso-
phy that is most important but, as we mentioned before, means little
in fact to the student body.

The students want to see the tangible results of a philosophy,

By IRV GARFINKEL
Now that Barry Goldwat-
er is Lyndon J ohnson’s op-
ponent "for the presidential

. election, liberals are under-

standably rallying around
Johnson. There is danger,
however, that these liberals
will slip into simply defend-
ing the President’s adminis-

tration to date. This would

be a mistake.

The poverty program is
a good example. Many lib-
erals argue that Johnson
got as much as he could.
This is probably true. But
this does not alter the fact
that the poverty bill will
just begin to scratch the
surface of poverty. If we
continue in such a piece-
meal fashion we will never
eliminate poverty.

What we need is a mas‘-‘ii

sive program simultaneous-
ly dealing with jobs, hous-
ing and education. And even
then, in some cases, like the
poverty stricken Negro in
the North where the family
structure is disintegrating,

‘it will take two or three

generations for the program
to succeed. '

MY ASSUMPTION is, of
course, that it is economic-
ally and socially feasible for
us to eliminate poverty in
the United States. The only
reason we haven't yet is be-

 

I   Student Govt.
’Draws Praise

 “Editor, The Pitt News ‘
_ In past years Student Govern-
ment has been accused of hav-

ing little else in mind besides
its own interest. Since last March
there has been a growing aware-
ness on the part of the ‘Execu-
tive of Student Government of
the need for progressive action.
Student need has replaced self-
interest, and with this change
in attitude have come important

proposals.

One such measure is the bill
now pending before the Student

: Senate which attempts to insti-

 
  

 

cause it is politically un-
feasible to do so. Thus my
task and the task of those
who agree that poverty
should and can be eliminat-
ed is to make a genuine war
on poverty possible. The
question remains, ‘How is
this to be done?
Campaigning for Presi'-
dent Johnson in this elec-
tion is not enough,‘ because
Goldwater's defeat in 1964.
while necessary, is not suf-
ﬁcient. If Goldwater wins,
it could be a tragedy. If he
loses by a little, and still
retains control of‘ the Re-
publican party and the Re-

publican party remains one

of the two dominant parties,
the Democrats and Johnson
are not likely to move to
the left of their present
position.

If on the other hand,
Johnson wins by a landslide,
thereby thoroughly discred-
iting the appeal of the right,

"our politics could move a

hop to the left. The last will
only occur however, if there
is a vocal group to the left
of J ohnson.
As things
Johnson has to answer_ to
Goldiwater. Goldwater says
thatthe poverty program is
just a political hoax. Liber-
alsanxious to defend J ohn-
son praise the bill. They
then find little time to ex-

stand now,

   

plain how much really needs
to be done.

BUT IF THE left agrees
that the poverty bill, while
better than nothing perhaps,
is just a gesture in the right
direction, they must educate
the public to this fact. Oth-
erwise how will a genuine
attack on poverty ever be-
come politically feasible? In
effect then, what I am sug-
gesting is that our politics
will become more liberal
only when Johnson must an-
swer to those on his left.

For the left then, the im-
mediate goal is Goldwater's
resounding defeat. In work-
ing towards this end, how.
ever, the left would be wise
to follow the example set
by the columnist James Res-
ton. In a recent column on
foreign affairs he wrote:

“The really important
question about the atomic
power of this nation is not,
as Goldwater asserts, that
it is declining, but that it
is piling up at astronomical
cost long after we already
have enough explosive pow-
er to incinerate the entire
human race several times
over, and contaminate the
earth into the bargain.”

Reston’s example indi-
cates that opposition to and
criticism of Barry Goldwat-
er, is compatible with criti-
cism of President J ohnson.

to me, is a clear indication of
the sterility of “respectable liber-
alism” of which Professor Schles-
inger is a [leading spokesman.
The great tragedy in this is that
the American political system is
seemingly in the throes of a ma-
jor realignment. At this critical
juncture, when the anti-Goldwa-
ter forces must present their
case as logically and forcefully
as possible, Professor Schlesinger
and Mr. Schlosser offer us in-
vective.

In a sterile attempt to analyze
“Goldwaterism,” Mr. Schlosser
has resorted to the old dodge of
appealing to authority. The au-
thority in this case, however, has
proved totally inadequate. Schles-
inger’s analysis, in effect, amounts
to casting dispersions on the in-

In an effort to further discredit

Uni

versity Growt
Booming Since ’54

  

‘W’

THE UPPER levels of the University’s soon-to-be-completed Space
Center appear to be a. lunehing pad for the Cathedral of Learning.
The Center is part of the Universlty’s massive expansion program.

Ten years ago, Chancellor
Litchﬁeld couldn't have bought
a meal ticket to Schenley Hall.
One reason is that there was no
Schenley Hall. Another is that
there was no Chancellor Litch-
ﬁeld. '

But since then, the University
has grown at such a rate that
in three years Forbes Field will
be replaced by a massive build-
ing complex that will house a
public and international affairs
area, law, business, education,
and social sections.

The expansion boom began in.
1954, two years before Chancel-
lor Litchﬁeld came to the Univer-
sity. That year, Scaife Hall, the
Graduate School of Public Health,
Engineering and Clapp Halls were
built.

Two years later, the old Schen.
ley Hall was bought, and con-
struction then began on Langely
Hall and Trees Hall Pool. In
1959, the University acquired the
O'Hara Barking Garage, which it
owns and operates.

Last fall, the ﬁrst occupants
moved into the three Towers, and
this summer the Sarah Mellon
Scaife Radiation Laboratory was
ﬁnished.

As of now, the building boom
is ﬂourishing. The Henry Clay
Frick Fine Arts building is near
completion; the physical educa-

tion building and the playing
ﬁelds are being built; and the
Space Research and Co-ordina-
tion Center is well under way.

Three other buildings to cost
$23 million, are in the planning
stage. They include a dental clin-
ic in front of Salk Hall; an en-
gineering building to replace the
present Armory, and a natural
science building in back of Lange.
ly Hall.

In addition, the planned Hill-
man Library and Common Facil-
ities building will be located

— where the Matthews Co. building

and the Mobil Station now stand.

According to the Physical Plant,
if the present buildings were d_up-
licated at cost, the sum would
be “substantially over $100 mil-
lion.”

With  It”

By Marvin Zelkovvitz

YOU BETTER WATCH OUT, BOYS
WHEN THE PANTHERS come up against'Oregon quar-
terback Bob Berry this Saturday night in Portland, they

will face one of the best long passers in the coun-
try. In addition, Berry runs the “action pass,” or op-
tion pass-run, very well.

, According to Panther defensive backfield coach
Carl DePasqua, who scouted the Ducks in their game
with Brigham Young, Berry is “cool. He doesn’t get
excited. He stays in his pocket, and can throw the
long pass accurately.” Berry threw three touchdown
passes against Brigham Young.

DePasqua says Berry does everything well. “He

‘ has a great deal of experience. He can move the ball
from anywhere on the ﬁeld.” Further testimony of
B-erry’s ability_are his passi'ng records. Although he
still has appoximately one-third of his collegiate foot-
ball ‘career yet to play, Berry already holds every
passing record at Oregon.

AGAINST BRIGHAM YOUNG, Berry personally ac-

for 165 of the Ducks’ 260 yards of total offense. He is as
vital to Oregon as an oxygen tent to a man who has
just had a severe heart attack.

The Ducks have a ground game that is as effective
and penetrating as the water on a duck’s back. In
thei'r_ﬁrst game, they rushed for 119 yards in 46 plays,

 or 2.6 yards per carry.

S0 ALL THEIR STRENGTH is on the wing of Duck

‘Ii-I-A. V ‘A quarterback Bob Berry. If the Panthers can contain him,

they can win easily. But the Panthers have never
contained a good passing quarterback. Even last sea-
son, the Panthers were unable to stop backs like
Miami’s George Mira, Navy’s Roger Staubach, and
Penn State’s Pete Liske. They outscored Mira and
and Liske. They did not outscore Staubach. _ .

The Panthers must defeat Oregon. If they lose to
Coach Len Casanova’s'team, they can forget about
the rest of the season. If the Panthers lose on Satur-
day, we’ll take a .500 season.

Although tackle Ron Linaburg might not start,
and Jim Jones is still slightly hobbled, -we think the
Panthers can outscore the Ducks. In Freddy Mazurek
the Panthers have a better quarterback than Berry,

* and one of the best rushing teams in the country.
THEREFORE, SINCE WE don’t like to admit we were
Wrong by picking the Panthers 8-2, and since we had

originally picked the Panthers to dump UCLA and

I lose to Oregon, we’ll just switch the ﬁrst two games,

and take the Panthers, 25-21.

COACH JOHN MICHELOSEN does not believe that last
"Saturday's scrimmage is an indication of‘ what will hap-

pen against Oregon. At a sportswriter’s luncheon on
Tuesday, the Panther head coach explained “The
option was a new thing for us, and because it was new,
there was a tendency on the part of the defenders to
do too much overrunning.”

Besides injuries the Pan-
thers have other problems in
getting ready for the Ore-
gon game tomorrow night
at Portland. The time dif-
ference has alw.ays been a hard

adjustment for the Panthers to
make in the past.

Coach John Michelosen is com-
bating the problem by leaving
early on Friday and staying at
a place called East Montana Col-
lege of Education in Billings,
Montana, if they can ﬁnd the

place. The Panthers will adjust,

to the different time by staying
out there for two days.

The squad has also practiced at
Mount Lebanon High School
Field to get practice under the
lights. The night ball game will
be a new venture for some mem-
bers of the team.

A night game won’t be the
only problem the Panthers have
as Bob Berry, star quarterback,
will test their defense. The
only other returning letterman
in the backﬁeld is Dennis Kell-
er, the left halfback.

Last week in the Brigham
Young gamer quarterback Berry
and defensive end Oliver McKin-
ney were named the offensive
and defensive players of the
game.

Berry completed 11 of 25 pass-
es for 141 yards and threw all
three of the Webfoots’ touch-
downs. McKinney recovered a
fumble and interc_epted a pass
and also made two key third
down tackles.

Coach Len Casanova has said
that centers Dave Tobey, six
foot-three 226 pounds is prob-
ably the best lineman on the
team. “I would have to rate
Dave Tobey as the best all
around lineman on the team.”

The Oregon football pamphlet
rates the strongest positions on
the Ducks as the center and of
course the quarterback. The tac-
kles and, guards are rated as the

Key Game in the East

By BILL CABIN

West Chester soccer coach
Mel Lorback stated that his of-

be tough.” That toughness will
be provided by George Jun-
gels, the Ram’s goalie who
posted 11 shutouts last year,
veteran halfbacks Billy Wolfe
and Craig-Reynolds, and slot-
man Matt Blum, who has
worked out with the Pan
American team.

Despite West Chester’s array
of talent, Bemis feels that the
booters “are just as good as
them. The thing that has made
West Chester a winning team is
teamwork,” said Bemis. “This
year we have that asset on our

heavily by graduation.” Coach

the Ram’s offense will be for-
midable when the booters face
them Saturday at Frick- Park

Although the Rams lost their
four starting linemen, Bemis
said, “‘They had the offensive
potential last year, but their

jured most of the season. This
year they're not injured -and
will be the starters.” Bemis also
noted that West Chester can

get through them.
“Our defense is stronger

Every boy dreams of catching
the’ big pass before a jammed sta-
dium to win the.big ball game.
The problem is that very few
ballplayers ever get the chance.
Left end Mitch Zalnasky had the
chance in his ﬁrst starting role
as a Panther, but his dream be-
came a nightmare.

Three times Zalnasky had pass-
es ﬂoat into and out of his hands.
Once he caught the ball and
lateraled it back unnecesarily,
losing the ball when the Pan-
thers seemed to be gaining mo-
mentum. H

anxious to get back in action and
prove ourselves,” he said.
“We were really bad in that
game because of the «mistakes
we made. The tackles charged
at wrong times, the linebackers
missed assignments -and so did
the secondary, however, I think
these mistakes were only the
result of inexperience.”

 

Inexperience is an often used
word but it applies appropriately
to the Panther problems and to
that of Zalnasky. “In the last
quarter we all wanted to win so
badly that we felt the pressure
doubly and it seemed neither
Eric Crabtree, Bill Howley, or
myself could hold onto the ball.”

The ends seemed to please the

coaches at Meadville with the
pass catching they had shown in
practive and Zalnasky looked ex-
ceptionally good in the ﬁnal
scrimmage for his defensive play
as.well'as his pass catching abil-
ity.

“I like to play defense a lit-
tle better than I do oifense be-
cause it’s what I feel I do best.
It's not that I'm not any good
on offense, but I donft have
the good speed to be a great
receiver.” -

If a football fan was trying
to pick .a typical Pitt end, Zalnas-

sky would ﬁt the mold. “I enjoy"

blocking, hitting or any kind of
body‘ contact better than catch-
ing passes, I think it is just as

Sage Predicts
Top Yogi Spot

For Himself  

Bob “Sage” Smizik predicted
last week that he would attain
the lead in the Yogi race. Thus
far, the Sage’s predictions have
been coming true. He is tied for
ﬁrst place with Marvin “Isaiah”
Zelkowitz, and the girls.

“I predicted before the sea-
son started that I would be in
first place,” Smizik said. “It
looks like I was right. I started
t e season in first place, and
that’s where Pm going to stay.”

“Isaiah” listened as Smizik
spoke. He smiled to himself, and
some bystanders said they heard
him murmuring a prayer. They
said it sounded like, “Please
don’t make the Sage feel too bad-

. ly when he loses this wee .”

Fran Novak picked’ for the
players this week in an attempt
to pull the players even with
the leaders.

Frank Carver picked for the
coaches and Joyce Ann Mory
picked for the girls.

Runners Face

Banner. “They only lost one boy
from ’63’s team.” Pitt ﬁnished
second last year with 54 points
to Ohio’s 16 and Kent’s 79.

Flushed with at 15-50 win over

'I‘hree_ unshaven young men in
