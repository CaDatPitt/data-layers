PENN CONTEST .  
ATTRACTS GRADS

_VA1umni who expelct to take the trip
to Philadelphia for the Pitt-Penn
game at Franklin Field October 27‘
are urged to comm.unica'te with the
Alumni Secr‘e.ta~ryV:a:t I once. Coach
Warner will decide this°week whether
-the team will go  the Q‘uaker'City
Friday morning or - Friday, evening
an-d infonrnation can -be given then
to those who wish to travel with the

v
a

football boys.
As stated in ‘the official notice of
the undergraduate cheer leaders, a
‘meeting has been held with the rep-
resenta-tives of the railroads and the
best rate obtainable is $15.72 lforthle
round trip.‘ This is the 10-party rate,
and» -is 'the~same as mileage. It ‘is a
saving of $1.78 over the Viregular one
p;art'y ticket. if 100 or more go, a
,.special train may '-be provided. The
trip can very easily be -made -for $25.00,
including «cost -of admissionV ticket to
the game. I ' V
The game will be one of the \best
of the year, as Penn, thoroughly
aroused, !by the VGe’o‘rgia-Tech game,

, will ﬁght ha'r7dei'V than ever to stave

off defeat ‘at the hands of Pitt for ‘the
thliid successive year. ' A
'_The crowd of Pitt rooters atVt_he
game will belarge. Members of the
NewV;'Y.ork Club will be there in a
body. They*wil1 travel via the Jersey
VCent‘ral Railroad, leaving New York
at 12 o'clock noon the day of the game
and arriving at 2 P. M. at the Reading
terminal. They "will take tax-is «from

’ AN‘ EXPLANATION. ’ I
Through no fault of the Alumni
office, we understand that the ﬁrst
two ‘issues of the .PITT.WEEKLY
‘were very late getting to the‘ mem-.
«bers. of the Association, In fact,‘
we believe the most of them were
not forward8d until « the V present -
week._ The ‘chances are that, the.
two issues will reach subscribers
about“'the same time. This we
very much regret, as "we are anx-
.ious to get the news to thealumni
“red hot.” V '
‘From what we can" learn,.things. .
have V now I adjusted‘ themselves and
J the circulation department and the
printer claim that papers will be
sent out each week right on the
dot: We propose to follow this
-upland see that they do. If alumni
did ndt get the ﬁrstissues of the
paper, we would like to know. We
will also arrange to havcthem sent.

Pitt Team

 A GivesLeI3igh Surprise

2:1-Int‘.

South Bethlehem Men Never

Had ‘Chance to Win—Mil1er
and Easterday Star.

 

S With comparative ease the Panther
aggregation walked the
eleven hailing from -Bethlehem, and

through

came out victors by a 41 to 0 score.
From the kick-off, when “Foxy” Mil-
ler made his ‘sensational run of 97
yards for -the ﬁrst touchdown of -the
game, to the last few minutes of play
Pitt had things their own way. Le-
high, during the entire time, had but

A , one chance to score, when they re-

covered a fumble on Pitt's 13-yard
line. This was as close as they ever
got to the goal line, however, as Her-
rington of Lehigh attempted a ﬁeld
goal and failed.

“Dope” had it that Lehigh w.as go-
ing _to give the Gold and Blue a run

for their money, but as seems inev-
-itably thecase in doping football, it was

all wrong. The old scoring machine,

“which made Pitt famous inrthe last‘

two years, seems to hays come back,
and with but a few minor exceptions,
which will be remedied with .a little
more practice, is ready to continue
as it has done. After the ﬁrst two
touchdowns were made it was evident
that the only question was as to the
amount of the score at the end of the
game. f ,

The only criticism to be made is
that of fumbles, both teams being

-guilty of -this offense, though Pitt was

the -chief offender. It was the result
of one of these fumbles which per-
mitted Lehigh to come -close to scor-
ing. Most of Pitt’s fumbles came,
however, after most of the regulars
had given ‘up their places for substi-
tutes in’ the last quarter. It might be

said regarding these substitutes that ‘

they showed a wonderful improve-
ment over their work ‘of last week.
They sh-ow that the coaches have de-
cided upon developing a Secondary

T it ~_ defense equal to that o-f last year, and

which helps to account for the- suc-
-cess of last year's team. If these men

.show much more improvement the
j present men on the regular team will
have to look to their laurels, if they

expect t-o remain on the squad. _
The Lehigh aggrega-tion came here
heralded as the greatest team which
ever represented that school, as it was
pr’actical1y the same team which
played there last ‘year, and which

ﬁne condition and showed at times
some of the coaching of Coach Keady
and Instructor Reiter. Pop Warner
had reason to be on guard, and as a
result whipped his team into condi-
tion to defeat a much stronger team A
than that which they met.

havetbeen much larger but for the
Liberty Bond parade, which was held
at the same time. Lehigh had a large
number of Alumni and -friends -on
hand, who stuck to their team
throughout, and exhibited ﬁne spirit
during the whole time that their men
were_going down to defeat. The stu-
dgxs of Pitt are beginning to appear
and by next Saturday there should be
a large number of them present. At
these two games played this season
there has not been the number that
might have been.

At the offensive the Gold and Blue
machine showed a power to gain at
will, and its actions -in.the last two
games has demonstrated its ability
on the defensive. Pitt again used the
passing game to perfection, the back-
ﬁeld seeming to be getting the pass»
down to the place where they use-d
it with such success last year.

At just 3:30 P. M., Halstead, for
Lehigh, kicked -off to Miller on the
Pitt 10-yard line. The ball bounced
out of his arms, he recovered it on
the 3—yard line, dropped in behind
Gougler -and Capt. Carlson, who
showed splendid interference, and the
three men ran around left end; Miller
ﬁnally crossing the goal line in the
longest run of the year and one of
the prettiest ever made on Forbes
Field. The Lehigh team was taken
off its feet and was one of the main
features in the ﬁnal win for Pitt.

Gougler kicked goal. A little later
Lehigh got the ball but was unable
to advance it to any extent. Lehigh
then kicked, and Pitt, by‘ successive
long gains «by McLaren, Gougler and

over, McLaren making the touch-
down. Gougler again kicked goal,‘
making the score, Pitt 14, Lehigh 0.
On thefollowing play Foxy Miller
hurt his leg, the same which put him
out for" several weeks last, year and
was forced out of the game.

Then, in spite of several fumbles
and three or four penalties, Pitt ad-
vanced the ball to_the Lehigh 15-yard
line, only to lose it again to Lehigh
on ‘her o-wn 40-yard line. Lehigh

ended with—the ball on Pit»t’s 45-yard
line. ‘

Early in the second quarter Easter-
day advanced the ball to Lehigh’s 18-
yard line on a long 25-yard run, and
Gougler -carried it to the 1-yard .line,
around left end. He then carried it
over and kicked the goal, bringing the
score to 21-0. .

Following this both teams did a
good deal of kicking until Pitler fum-
bled the ball on P-itt’s 13-yard line,
and it was recovered by Lehigh. Her-
rington then failed miserably at a try

for aﬁeld goal. The half ended‘with
jthe score Pitt 21, Lehigh 0.

] In the third-quarter Easterd-ay, Mc-
Laren and Gougler by only a few
long runs, brought the ball again to
Lehigh’s 1-yard line. McLaren went
through center for a touchdown and
Gougler failed at kicking goal. This
was the only score in this period,
many substitutes being sent in The
score stood Pi-tt‘“27, Lehigh 0. ‘

LOOKIN’ ’EM OVER

Merle “Moons” Hellman has been
elected to lead the freshman football
squad of 1917.

is one of the most promising -men that
has entered the University this year.
His pleasing personality, qualities of
leadership and athletic ability made
him the n.atural and inevitaxble man for
the -captaincy of the yearling team.

The question as to whether history
will repeat itself its a problem which
is occupying the student mind when
it comes to consideration of the
Syracuse game for next Saturday.

The good spirit that has ever existed
between Pitt and Lehigh in athletic
encounters was further borne out in
the contest Saturday. The conduct of
the Maroon and White team, was in
perfect keeping with its traditions,
and the Blue and Gold maintained
their usual high standard of playing
conduct. It was truly a svport?s.man’s
game.

- We are wondering what became of
the gloom dispenser who not only
doubted the ability of VVarner to get
eleven men out of the Pitt squad.‘-but
declared - that the Blue and Gold

advanced the ball on the kick-off to »W0u1d
, the 30-yard line.

Hellman is a graduate,
of the Vvilkinsburg High School and'

line of defense. There was something
in the manner the second-string men
‘conducted themselves Saturday that
serve to dispel the darkest
gloom imaginable. *

It would be innteresting to see what
wou_.ld happen were VV.arner to make
a permanent shift with Carlson’ at‘
quarter. The do-ughty Pitt-t captain
entered the game in that capacity -for
a few ‘moments last Saturday, and the.
way he cut loose was a marifel. Last
year on the eve of the Syraeuse game

peat hi-msel-if this year?

 

Foxy Millef repeated the -play, that
made him -famous last Saturday by
running through the whole Lehigh
team for a touchdown. With the
pro-bable exception of Del:'Iart, Miller
has made more .long runs during the
time —he has «been on the Pi-tt squad
than any other man of the last four
years, exceipting Chalky Williamson.

CARLs0Nis MEN
HAVE HARD FOE

‘The Syracuse encounter loo-ms on
the horizon as the next game for the
University of Pittsburgh gridders.
The gamewill be -one of the -most
gruelling tests of the year, and Pop
'W:a_rner is spending the week «pointing

-the team for the clash with the Salt
City aggregation. « '
Despite the com~pleten"es-s of the

proteges last Saturday, it‘was not
won «because the Lehigh team was
not; a worthy foe, but because Pitt
developed unexipeoted strength. War-
ne_r had rlevelo.ped a defensive system
against which the attack of ‘Keady’s

deiavor. The visitors were balked at
every turn, :and, ‘beyond some widely
se.pa1'ated gains, their assault was so
impotent that only one ﬁrst down was
gained by their aball rushing.

When Carlson’s men took the initi-

ative they held Lel1igh’at their mercy.
They punctured the lii§ and skirted
the ends at will. The famous ‘inter-
ference .s.wept forward with such
~power’~that it stamped out the first
line and saddled the burden of de-
fense onto the backs. Those worthics
were subjected to such a merciless
-bombardment as to -render them un-
equal to the task of ball-advancing
when the oval came into their pos-
session.
S The Syracuse eleven, still smarting
under the crushing defeat of last year,
comess. to Pittsburgh next Saturday
determined to wipe the blot from its
re-cord and e-further satisfy its sup-
porters by reversing the situation -of
last-year. _ V ' ,

The Syracuse team of this season
will ‘be quite a different ‘proposition
from the delegation defeated by the

~B1ue'and Gold invincibles last year.

Yorkers have as -coach the football

ball teams. 'O’Neill has taken the
squad as it came to him, and the re-
port-ts from the Salt Cityindicate that
he is fast rounding them into a power-
ful -machine.

O’Neill has the advantage of some
very fine material-. Capt. “Ty” Cobb
is regarded as_0ne of the best tackles
in the country. Chick Meehan, who
was adjudged the best back in the
team oflast year, is back and will be
in his old place at quarter. The -two
Browns, Eddie and Matt, are both
good men. Shehadin is an end of
great promise, while Thompson, the
husky guard, who always kept Barbe
White and Schlachter on the uneasy
seat for their positions, is again in
line."

Thompson is attended on the other
side of center by Segal, who plays a
gery strong ga-me. These two men
will keep Sies and Sutherland hustling
to hold their own. With such mate-
rial at hand Coaches O’Neill and
Reynolds will be able to turn out a
machine that will be a difficult one to
down. ' ~

This is the second game with Syra-
cuse, and is the final tilt in «the fulﬁll-
ment of a two-year contract. Last
year the Panthers went to Syracuse
and this s-eason the Salt Qfity men re-
turn the compliment by coming to
Pittsburgh. This game is recognized
as -one of the ‘big contests of the year.
It was immediately accepted as fully
as important as either the Penn, VV.
&. J. or State games.

‘PLAY SYRACUSE

After a trouncing at Kiski last Sat-
urday, the Freshmen are going up
New York way this week to take on
some -big game in the shape of the
Syracuse Freshmen. Word from that
district gives ‘us a hunch that our fel-

lows are going to have some fast step-

ping to do. Still, Syracuse, having
abandoned the one-year eligibility
rule, has the ‘pick of the Freshmen
on the Varsity, so that the ﬁrst year
boys will be deprived of this material.

the Pitt ye-arlings will be in top form.

All things considered, thgse fresh-
men of ours didn’t present such a bad
offering at Kiski Saturday. Although
they lost by the seemingly one-Sided
soore of 34 to 0, still they did very
well for a green team on its ﬁrst time

ence -of the ‘prep school forwards gave '
them a big advantage throughout the

Tlle Saltsburg Submarines, led by the
spectacular Davies, at quarter, tor-
pedoed the Blue and Gold at every
turn. Their little general pummeled
‘the line, skirted the ends, or shaved
the tackles each time he chose to
carry the ball. Authoritiels who wit-
ncssed the. game hold that his open
ﬁeld running was the best seen on
the Kiski ﬁeld since the time of Hast-
ings and Dehait. Stein, Holleran and_
Al-lesbrand did yoeman duty.
