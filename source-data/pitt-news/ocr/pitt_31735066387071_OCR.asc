Violence breaks out on campus

By Stephen Kozarovich
Asst. News Editor

“Mayhem everywhere” was how one
city police officer described a scene that
resulted in the arrest of six Pitt students
after a ﬁght broke out in the William Pitt
Union Friday night.

The fight started during an invitation-
only dance for high school students
sponsored by Pitt’s Upward Bound pro-
gram, when some other students came in
“with the intent to start something”
through a side door, according to
Upward Bound Director Renee Frazier.

Police evacuating the union and the
mixing of Pitt students into the crowd
only made the situation worse, accord-
ing to Pitt student Bryan Morrison.

Morrison said he saw at least 15 cam-
pus police officers waiting for backup
from city police standing around in the
union while people kept running in and

out of the building.

“Why wasn’t that stopped?” Morrison
said. “Couldn’t they lock the door?”

Campus police were not available to
comment on the situation, but university
spokesperson Bob Reteshka told KDKA
News, “The University of Pittsburgh will
investigate the situation.”

Another Pitt student, Vernard Williams,
said, “The intensity of the situation esca-
lated because of the way the cops were
handling Pitt students.”

Williams and Morrison were waiting
for a bus to take them to a bowling
social with the National Society of Black
Engineers when they got in the middle
of the situation. Both said they were told
to leave campus by police who used
repeated racial slurs.

’Williams and Pitt sophomore Todd
Graf said they both saw bottles thrown at
the police during the fracas.

Police accused of abusing force

By Matt Serlin
Asst. Photography Editor

“The Rodney King incident came into
my mind,” president of Pitt’s National
Society of Black Engineers Soma
Bajpayee said.

Although police were needed to break
up the original fight inside the William
Pitt Union, many students said they
thought the police force of at least 30
officers went too far in controlling the sit-
uation that spread out of the union into
Schenley Quad Friday night.

City police officers were called to the
scene by campus police after a fight
broke out in the union at an event for
high school students.

“I saw the cops get ridiculous,”
Peabody High School student Syrano
said. “They swung a girl around, grabbed
her by her hair and kicked her. She was
just trying to help her cousin.”

At least 15 people were arrested and
two were injured, university spokesper-
son Tim Ziaukas told KDKA News.

Pitt police were not available to com-
ment on the incident, but spokesperson
Bob Reteshka told KDKA News, “The
University of Pittsburgh will investigate
the situation.”

Pitt student Bryan Morrison said he
was on his way to a Pitt National Society
of Black Engineers bowling social when
he was harassed by a city police officer.

“This city officer said to me, ‘I had to
come from the ghetto all the way down
here,’ and I didn’t know what he meant,”
Morrison said.

The officer then put his forearm into
his back and began to push him,
Morrison said.

“I said to him, ‘There’s no reason why
you have to take such physical force just
to disperse a crowd,”’ Morrison said. “He

This week the Student
Government Board will help begin

marathon.

The 24-hour marathon, spon-
sored by Family House, is slated for
April 1995 and is expected to
become an annual
According to SGB President Ross
Pasquale, marathon organizers
hope the event can become as suc-
cessful at Pitt as it is at other univer-
sities.

“The dance marathon at Penn
State is the largest single fund—rais-
ing event in the country,” Pasquale
said. “It raises $1 million in 24
hours.”

Family House, which has one
house in North Oakland and one in
South Oakland, provides a resi-

Students interested in help-
irig sexual assault victims and
raising sexual assault aware-
ness are encouraged to become
a sexual assault peer educator,
a new program at Pitt.

“The role of a peer educator
is to help prevent further sexu-
al victimization on campus,”
said Sexual Assault Services
Coordinator Mary Koch Ruiz, in
a letter to Pitt student leaders.

According to Ruiz, the peer
program will be “students help-
ing students, which is an
extremely useful vehicle for
addressing this issue on,cam-
pus.” One goal of the program
is to create an “awareness of
the dynamics of date and
acquaintance rape,” an issue
that is a major concern to Ruiz.

Dr. Bob Gallagher, the head
of Pitt’s Counseling and
Development Center, said he is
enthusiastic about this new
program. “lThese] students will

go through a very extensive
training program,” he said.

The training program .will
teach the students to “promote
healthy relationships through
effective communication and
prevent sexual victimization
through educational program-
ming,” the Ruiz letter said.

The educators will learn dif-
ferent techniques of teaching,
such as videotapes and role
playing exercises.

After the training process, the
educators will be able to con-

duct workshops for the univer-
sity community.

Any males or females who
are sensitive to the issue of sex-
ual assault and are able to com-
municate effectively on these
issues are encouraged to apply,
according to Ruiz.

Training for the program will
run from May 9 to Aug. 8,
and students will meet once a
week. Any interested students
should Contact Ruiz at the
Counseling and Development
Center for an application.

Crowell, said marathon organizers
will be holding a session on
Thursday to distribute information
on the marathon and place interest-
ed students into‘ committee posi-
tions. He said there will be 12 com-
mittees working on the project.

“We hope to have students from
all constituencies working on the
project,” Pasquale "said. “lFamily
House] is asking for student lead-
ers, but anyone who wishes to help
out is welcome to do so.”

Middle East expert outlines prospects for peace

Byjon Hayes
Staﬂ’ Writer

As the second installment of
Pitt’s “Prospects for Peace in the
Middle East,” Deputy
Ambassador Michael Shiloh, the
second—ranking diplomat for
Israel’s Embassy in Washington,
D.C., outlined Israel’s historical
and contemporary role in the
Middle East peace process.

Shiloh highlighted five factors
that led to last September’s
peace accord: the collapse of
the Soviet Union, the United
States’ emergence as the world’s
only superpower, Iraq’s defeat
in the Persian Gulf War, the
emergence of Muslim radicalism
and nuclear proliferation fol-
lowing the end of the Cold
War.

According to Shiloh, a sense
of urgency accompanies current
peace negotiations with the
Palestine Liberation

Organization and other Arab

countries because so many new
countries possess nuclear
weapons.

“If we postpone it until the
year 2000, we may find the
negotiating territory more dan-
gerous,” he said.

He said the five global devel-
opments which he mentioned
have forced the Israeli govern-
ment to change its priorities.

He said the new focus on
peace intensified when Yitzhak
Rabin became prime minister.

According to Shiloh, under
Rabin Israeli officials have said,
“Let us go for the calculated risk
of changing our strategies and
negotiating with the PLO and
Yasser Arafat.”

“A great risk taken by the gov-
ernment of Israel represents a
great hope,” he emphasized.

According to both Shiloh and
audience member Sufyan Al-
Sahrawi, a graduate student
who belongs to the Muslim
Student Association, Israel’s risk

in negotiating.with Arafat is that
he may not be an appropriate
representative of the Palestinian
people.

Al—Sahrawi said, however,
“Once Palestinians feel like they
have a homeland, it will snow-
ball and [Arafat] will regain sup-
port.”

Shiloh said Jewish extremist
Baruch Goldstein’s massacre of
at least 29 Muslims praying in a
mosque on Feb. 25 created a
new political situation for the
negotiating parties.

Referring to such radical acts
of Jewish and Palestinian terror-
ism, he said, “You can be sure
there will be attempts on the
part of fundamentalists to
undemiine the process.”

Al—Sahrawi said Goldstein was
not a lone deranged man;
rather, the Israeli military
helped Goldstein with the
shooting and gave him muni-
tions.

“He represents a tangible fac-

tion of the Israeli community,
which is the settlers [in
Hebron],” Al—Sahrawi said.

Shiloh said the last five weeks
have been difficult because the
PLO presented unreasonable
demands following the mas-
sacre.

“It is only today that the par-
ties reconvened in Cairo, and if
all goes well  we will arrive at
an agreement with the
Palestinians to discuss the state
of Jericho and Gaza,” Shiloh
said.

He said with ideal negotia-
tions, the Israeli government
may be in a position to grant
concessions to the PLO.

To protect Palestinians, Israel
may concede Palestinian self-
rule over Jericho and Gaza,
which however, would not
include sovereignty, he said.

Al—Sahrawi disagreed.

“These are not concessions,
they are rights for the

would encourage cbdnge dz‘ Pitt

By Jennifer McGinnis
Staff Writer

It isn’t the provost’s role to make
change, but rather to encourage it,
according to Provost candidate Sylvia

‘Manning added.

Manning fielded questions on issues
ranging from lab research and animal
rights to economic and multicultural
matters at the open forum designed to
give the university community the
chance to question the final Provost can-
didates.

When asked how she, as an English
professor, felt about the importance of
scientific research at a university like
Pitt, Manning replied that she encour-
aged lowering the barriers for cross—dis—
ciplinary research.

She clarified her stance on animal test-
ing and research by stating,

“My own views are that it’s probably
necessary, though I personally prefer
not to lay eyes on the animals
themselves. It goes on. There are
things you can find out only in that
Way.”

In the area of budget cuts that the uni-
versity will be facing in the future,
Manning said she would first make cuts
across the board to “trim the fat.”

She would then administratively
decide which things needed to be sup-
ported at superb levels, decent levels
and which things could be done away
with. ‘

Manning stressed the importance of
looking for alternative sources of funds,
rather than merely cutting the budget.

A lot of fimds at USC come from pri-
vate donations, and Manning said in that
area “there are a lot of fields to plow at
Pitt.”

In response to a question about the

promotion of cultural diversity, Manning
said, “In the fall of 1993, USC admitted
its first majority minority class.
Something like 50.2 percent of our fresh-
man class are minorities  we have a
richly diverse student body.”

Manning cited the new program at
USC which uses a central pool of funds
to encourage individual departments to
hire minority faculty. USC has also
developed a diversity requirement for
undergraduates and a neighborhood
outreach program with students in
schools in downtown South Central Los
Angeles.

“I’ve worked very closely with the
creation of our most-wonderful neigh-
borhood outreach program,” Manning
said. “It is a program that reaches out
to our immediate neighbor schools 
it screens out 60 kids in the sixth grade,
puts them in programs with the seventh
grade, puts them on the USC cam-
pus two hours a day, five days a week

. plus gets the parents involved
by requiring a Saturday program, and
at the end admits the kids to USC with
a four-year scholarship,” Manning
said.

In response to a question on the value
she places on teaching skill at a research
institution such as Pitt, Manning said it
was important and it should be given
status and honor, but that she would not
give tenure to a professor who did little
publishing.

“I think that the tenure line at a major
research institution requires publishing.
You lose some very good teachers that
way, and a lot of good teaching institu-
tions beneﬁt from that,” Manning said.

’ Manning said her goal in coming to a

school like Pitt is coming to understand

the potential and aspirations of the

respond to the changes of today

By Jennifer McGinnis
Staﬂ Writer

The central issue for the Pitt communi-
ty is how the university will respond to
the world of change we’re living in,
according to a candidate for the high-
ranking position of Pitt provost.

Robert Griffith, dean of the Arts
and Humanities at the University of
Maryland and a finalist for the Pitt
provost position, spoke at an open
forum Thursday afternoon in the
Cathedral of Learning to answer ques-
tions and voice his views on the position
of provost.

Griffith opened the forum with a
speech describing the rapidity of change
in the post-Cold War era that we are cur-
rently in.

“The central issue for all of us is how
our universities will respond to this
world of change. Changes can be terrify-
ing; there are winners and losers, and no
one wants to be a loser,” Griffith said.

Griffith listed economic, technological,
demographic and spiritual components
of the process of change. In the future
the university will be challenged to do
more with less, use computing to change
the face of research, administration and
instruction and respect diversity, Griffith
said.

Managing the process of budget-plan-
ning in a way that produces concrete
and operational results and implement-
ing changes which will serve the univer-
sity well should be the two most impor-

tant priorities of a provost, according to

Griffith.

Griffith cited his experience with mak-
ing difficult budget cuts at Maryland, not-
ing that he got a unanimous endorse-
ment from the campus senate when he
was forced to‘ cut two large and popular

programs.

He cited the importance the University
of Maryland places on teaching, includ-
ing its small class sizes and active, partic-
ipatory learning strategies.

“There is no reason why we can’t have
research universities that respect good
teaching,” Griffith said.

“There must be a bottom line.
Professors must demonstrate both excel-
lence in research and teaching to earn
tenure,” he added.

Diversity must also be addressed by a
provost, according to Griffith. Our coun-
try needs to forge a genuine multicultural
democracy, he said.

“If we [universities] can’t help create
that future, we’re in trouble.”

As history department chair at
Maryland, Griffith said he recruited 11
people, eight of whom were women and
minorities.

He noted Maryland’s undergraduate
diversity requirement which requires stu-
dents to take courses in women’s history
or African, Asian or Latin American histo-

Griffith holds a bachelor’s degree in
history from Depauw University, and a
master’s and doctorate also in history
from the University of Wisconsin at
Madison.

A Pitt faculty member questioned what
Griffith would do to support the sci-
ences, despite his background in the arts
and sciences.

Griffith responded that he wanted an
opportunity to engage in issues outside
of the arts and humanities.

At the level of provost, you do
not work with specifics. You need to
be able to understand the major prob-
lems, listen to good advice from scien-
tists and then make the decisions,
Griffith said.

C0-ed fraternity dresses as clownsfor children

By Jon Hayes
Staff Writer

Meet nine merry-making Alpha Phi
Omega clowns: Minnie, Mikey, Stinkey,
Jeffy, Georg (pronounced gay org), Windy,
Wheezy, Blondie and Ungula.

This past Saturday afternoon, these frater-
nity members and pledges donned their
polka-dotted ties and two-foot long shoes

to perform wacky skits, play games and do

the hokey-pokey with the Big Brothers and
Big Sisters organization.

According to fraternity president and
Ringling Bros. and Barnum and Bailey cir-

cus aspirant Shawn Radcliffe (Windy),
Alpha Phi Omega is a co-ed organization
designed to promote leadership, friendship
and service.

It takes more than a costume to make a
clown a good one, Radcliffe said.

“To be a good clown you have to have
lots of fun, you have to care about your
audience, you have to enjoy making people
laugh and you have to be relaxed and easy-
going.”

And laugh they did.

Big Sister Della Trower brought her Little
Sister, Jessica Hooper, to Alpha Phi
Omega’s clowning to watch the skits and

participate in the circle games.

Pointing to Windy, Hooper said, “I liked
that clown with the shoes.”

“The games were a really good idea  It’s
good how they got the kids involved. They
should do this every year,” Trower added.

But clowning is just one of the fratemity’s
many activities. Pledge Chair Tom
McManuels said that the fraternity logged
over 200 hours in community service last
weekend.

He said half the members participated in
the Hand-in—Hand Festival, while the rest
were involved in a project to clear litter

The human brain is only
about the size of two clenched
fists held tightly together, but
this principal structure of the
central nervous system is the
most complex organ in the
human anatomy.

How does the human brain

ories and abstract thought?

Through research in the cog-
nitive and neural sciences, the
Center for the Neural Basis of
Cognition, a combined study
with the University of Pittsburgh
and Carnegie Mellon University,
has been established to work
toward solving the mysteries of
higher_ brain functions, such as
thinking, problem-solving and
memory.

Robert Y. Moore, professor of
psychiatry, neurology and neu-
roscience at Pitt, and James L.
McClelland, a Carnegie Mellon
University professor of psychol-

that technology and computer
science enable them to study
the processes of the brain.

“The purpose of the study is
to understand the brain mecha-
nisms which underlie how the

The study will also provide
information on how the neural

Institute for Blacle Family strives to improve the community

By Michael Henderson
Staff Writer

Such things as teenage preg-
nancy, drug use and poor edu-
cation are just a few of the
problems facing many African
Americans in today’s society.
The University of Pittsburgh has
seen these problems and has
taken action to help remedy
them.

The Institute for the Black
Family, created by Pitt’s
Department of African Studies,
is working hard to enhance
techniques which can diminish
the problems that many African-
American families are faced
with daily.

According to Jerome Taylor,
co—director, the mission for this
program is to “enhance viability
of black families through
research, programs and policy
initiatives”.

The Institute has three initia-
tives it calls Research Networks.
The Research Networks have
three branches: spirituality, cul-
ture and wellness. All three ini-
tiatives include the convening
of local scholars and practition-
ers from many facets of the
social, medical and spiritual
community who have
expressed interest. These local
experts identify possible con-
cerns for this research and prac-
tice.

Taylor said the Spirituality
Research Network’s main pur-
pose is to focus on the impor-
tance of spirituality in relation to
several problems confronting
African-American families.
These problems include com-
munity, addiction, under-
achievement, child abuse and
neglect, infant mortality and
street gang violence.

Conferences, studies on car-
diovascular health among
African Americans and surveys
from the Gallup organization
are included in the list of steps
IBF has taken to launch this net-
work initiative.

“[The Cultural Research
Network] helps in exploring the
importance of cultural identity

for a wide range of problems
confronting the African-
American community,” Taylor
said.

According to Taylor, the most
important aspects of this net-
work include mental and physi-
cal health, intimate relationships
and teenage violence.

IBF has sponsored a think
tank of national scholars who
have an interest in the cultural
aspect to contribute to this net-
work.

Other activities include feder-
ally-sponsored research on the
subject of how cultural identity
and mental and physical health
are linked, the development of
a preliminary process measure
of cultural organization and
intervention programs to
enhance cultural formation.

The wellness part of the
Research Network deals with
lifestyle, cultural and social
issues that may effect the physi-
cal well-being of African-
American families.

In order to accomplish this,
the network includes spiritual
and cultural variables on health-
promoting behaviors, cross--
national studies of health pro-
motion issues, as well as other
steps which IBF has implement-
ed.

The IBF has also developed a
Model Program Network.

“This network will strive to
make programs local and
national,” said Taylor. He said
in the fall term IBF also innovat-
ed a connection of scholars and
practitioners internationally
throughout the Internet com-
puter system.

“The purpose this connection
is to put people in touch who
share common commitments,”
said Taylor. A

IBF has developed programs
that will do a multitude of good
for the African-American com-
munity.

Among the list some include
programs to enhance self-
esteem and reduce anxiety and
hostility in adult family mem-
bers, the promotion and
advancement of cultural well-

“We try to bring to the table

nationally] with families that are

into the African-American
neighborhoods that need it. The
institute tries to go beyond cen-
ter based programs such as day
care, preschool and drug treat-
ment centers.

These professionals provide
counseling, parent training and
developmental assessments to
families that have been identi-
fied as abusive and neglectful
toward their children.

Teen parents and their
extended families would be

included also.

Policy initiatives are backed
by two parts. First is cultural
policy, which is “designed to
identify and institutionalize val-
ues that enhance viability of
African-American families,”
Taylor said. Next is “diunital,”
which brings together a proac-
tive blending of cultural and
public policy models.

IBF has a new proposal to
develop a National Association
for African-American Families
which could be active in 1995.
The purpose of this program
will basically be the same as
IBF, but it will focus nationally
instead of locally, according to
Taylor.

IBF has approximately 30
people on staff at Pitt, 25 of
whom are full-time, who work
out of the Department of
African Studies located in
Forbes Quad. Two members of
IBF’s staff were recently singled
out for their positive impact 0
the community. i

Children and Youth Services
of Allegheny County recognized
Joyce Brown and Cynthia
Banner for their outstanding
work in caregiving.

According to Lenall Thomas,
supervisor of the Right Start pro-
gram in which Brown and
Banner work, this is the first
year Children and Youth
Services have given such an

award.

“We’re proud that the fust two
people to receive this reward
are on our staff,” Thomas said.

Brown, who has worked in
the program for 15 years, serves
as an in—home worker and
supervisor. Banner, a child
development evaluator, has
been involved in the institute
for 11 years.

“They represent us very well
— their high level of ability at
teaching parenting skills is an
asset to the university,” Thomas
said.

“They go out of their way to
work with the families. Even
when they are not working they
are available to the families.”

Thomas said Brown and
Banner are people who achieve
the goal of the Institute for the
Black Family, which is to instill
certain values into children.

“We teach families parenting
skills, cooperation and social
skills,” Thomas said.

“We try to instill respect, self-
confidence, learning orienta-
tion, self-reliance and self-
esteem.”

The families involved with the
Right Start program are all
referred by Children and Youth
Services, according to Thomas.
The families have been identi-
fied by the agency as “at risk,”
or recommended for services by
the courts.

“Basically, our theory is to do
a lot of service projects and
have a lot of fun while doing
them,” McManuels said.

Radcliffe said the fraternity is
involved in a service project
every weekend. In the past,
Alpha Phi Omega has conduct-
ed activities-for the Cancer
Institute, Boy Scouts of
America, Western Psychiatric
Institute and Clinic, Children’s
Hospital and the Veteran’s
Administration Hospital, just to
name a few.

“Most people think of service

as being, ‘Oh we have to do
this, we have to do that,’ [but]
we do it because it’s fun. We
enjoy ourselves, and that’s
where the friendship comes in.”
Radcliffe said.

Many members, whose activi-
ties range from clowning to
soup kitchen work and clothing
drives, said the fraternity has
helped them grow and become
a better person.

“Rather than just being on
campus and being sheltered,
you’re going out there and ser-
vicing the community. But
in doing that you’re also leam—
ing from it, and that’s the whole

process, I believe, of college
—-— to be slowly exposed to
the real world,” Sean Santarelli
said.

Radcliffe said members enjoy
working hard for their commu-
nity, and pledges are expected
to work just as hard and have
just as much fun.

A serious Stinky, Joe
Kornblatt, said, “I like partici-
pating in service. I did it all
through high school, and when
I got to college I was looking
for someplace where I could
continue to do community ser-
vice, and Alpha Phi Omega pre-
sented itself to me.”

“Everything started going

crazy,” said Graf, who was
walking past the union
when the situation began.
Graf also said he saw city
and campus police “throw-
ing around” a pregnant stu-
dent in the lobby of Amos
Hall. “It was ridiculous.”

Another Pitt student,
Hakim Graham, who was in
the crowd gathering in
Schenley Quad, said he also
saw bottles ﬂying and police
hostility.

Graham said he was with
a group of black Pitt stu-
dents who were being
harassed by a Pittsburgh
police officer.

“She was saying ‘You
wanna go too? You wanna
‘go downtown?”’ Graham
said.

Across the Quad, Graham
said he and his group saw
police “slam two-small, skin-
ny, scrawny girls up against
a wall.”

Frazier said she did not
think the fight at the dance
was gang-related.

“It was probably over a
young lady. It usually is,”
Frazier said. “We told the
students no gang parapher-

gang signals.”

Frazier said dances like

“We try to have something
because the kids do need an
outlet,” Frazier said, “but
everything just went hay-
wire.

“This is so unfortunate that
they have to be penalized
for someone else’s anger
and frustration, which goes
to show we have got a lot of
work to do.”

The students charged by

Shiloh said Rabin is
also ready to make peace
with traditional enemies
beyond Israel’s borders.

“The best guarantee of
peace for Israel is to
arrive at peace with her
neighbors,” he said. The
neighbors Shiloh specifi-
cally mentioned were
Lebanon, Jordan and
Syria.

Shiloh said Rabin is

prepared to give the
Golan Heights to the
nation of Syria.
He did add, however,
that “at no point did
Rabin say Israel will with-
draw completely. Surely,
among the stipulations
[for any territorial conces-
sions arel security and
defense.”

responded by saying, ‘I want
your black ass off this campus.”

Morrison also said that a
friend he was with, also a Pitt
student, was told to leave the
campus, and when the officer
saw him later on school proper-
ty, the officer arrested him.

Several Pitt students said they
witnessed a pregnant woman
being hit by police. The preg-
nant student was hit and then
arrested by police, according to

Pitt student Martel Sisco.

“They threw around a preg-
nant girl and then arrested three
or four of her friends who went
to help her up,” Morrison said.
“The cops were yelling, ‘I don’t
care! I don’t care!”

“There was no respect for

human regard,” Morrison
added.
Another incident that

occurred involved two unidenti-
fied high school students who
were at the scene.

“They were walking away
when about 10 cops jumped on
them and threw them on the
ground,” Bajpayee said. “They
were hitting them with their
nightsticks.”

The police also brought a dog
onto one of the subjects while
he was on the ground, accord-
ing to Bajpayee.

“He was unconscious, and
they were trying to wake him
up,” Bajpayee said. “Then they
picked him up by his arms and

legs and dragged him into a
paddy wagon.

“They were little kids,”
Bajpayee said. “I got sick to my
stomach. I couldn’t watch.”

“Police are supposed to be
people we look up to, and this
is how they treat us," she said.
“It took all my might not to go
up and say anything because I
knew they would do the same
thing to me.”

The Greek Week dance marathon attract-
ed over 800 students to dance for the 12-
hour time period. According to Pasquale,
Family House plans on the 24-hour

marathon attracting hundreds of people.
However, he said it will take a few years
before it raises the amount of money raised
by other schools.

He said interested students are welcome
to participate at 7 p.m. on Thursday, when
food and music will be provided at an infor-
mation session in the William Pitt Union
Ballroom. According to Crowell, there will
also be a brief presentation on the fund-rais-
ing aspect of the project.

“This is going to be a year—long project,”
Pasquale said. “It will be good volunteer
experience and the project will directly ben-

efit the university.”

In other SGB business:

°Board member Todd Neufeld
announced the Scouting for Food drive will
be held April 12-14. He said every organiza-
tion with whom he has spoken said they
will “actively participate in the drive.”

The drive is a city-wide effort which ben-
efits Pittsburgh’s poor and homeless.

“We are hoping to have a box on every
ﬂoor in the residence halls,” Neufeld said,
“but students can definitely bring cans and
non-perishable household items to boxes in
the Towers Lobby or the union.”

Abuse of power intolerable

Last Friday night, a brawl erupted in the William Pitt
Union as both Campus Police and City of Pittsburgh
Police officers moved to quell a ﬁght that erupted at a
dance in the William Pitt Union. The ﬁght began at a
dance sponsored by Upward Bound, a program for
disadvantaged high school students, which was sup-
posed to give these students a taste of college.

The dance was supposed to be attended only by stu-
dents who had been invited, and according to the
director of Upward Bound, the fight was started by stu-
dents who came in a side door. The ironic element to
this story is that this was the first time metal detectors
were being used to help prevent trouble. After the
fight was cleared, the building was closed off, and the
students were funneled out into the Schenley Quad
and out in front of the Union. In the Quadrangle, there
was were a group of students waiting to go to a bowl-
ing marathon sponsored by the National Society for
Black Engineers.

Once outside, the police began to make arrests and
disperse the crowd. According to the Pittsburgh Post-
Gazetie, there were two pregnant students who were
caught up in the melee as they walked past and were
roughly treated by officers. The officers were said to
have made remarks to black students about coming
from the ghetto and “I want your black ass off this
campus,” according to Pitt student Bryan Morrison.
These students were by no means criminals and law
breakers. They were either high school students caught
up in a bad situation or Pitt students who happened to
be in the wrong place at the wrong time.

Battering high school and college students with trun-
cheons and turning dogs on them is outrageous. Once
the police realized what they were dealing with, they
should have used as much restraint as permitted by the
situation. Harassing passers—by and even arresting and
assaulting them are strong-arm tactics which shouldn’t
be encouraged in police forces. Although the campus
police weren’t the only ones involved, they are respon-
sible for the safety of Pitt students, and using or allow-
ing unnecessarily violent actions to be used against
them is unacceptable. Students who feel they were
wronged by the police should file a formal complaint
with the university and the police department.

Pitt spokesman Bob Reteshka told KDKA News, “The
university will investigate the situation.” When can the
students expect the results of this investigation?
Students should use this incident as a rallying point to
support their fellow students’ human rights. There are
enough witnesses that this outrage cannot be denied.
The people at Pitt must speak up and show that the
use of excessive force will not be tolerated on this
campus.

Hope emerges for the newly diagnosed

What do you do when some-
one says, “God works in myste-
rious ways?” When I hear that, I
solemnly nod my head, the
speaker nods theirs and it is
tacitly understood that a
Definitive Answer has been
given.

Caretaker/co—dependent ten-
dencies motivate me not to say
something like, “What exactly
do you mean by that?” I guess I
just don’t want to upset the
speaker by questioning some-
thing of which he/she is entire-
ly certain, plus the fact that I
don’t want to appear to be “dif-
ficult.” At all costs I want to
avoid someone saying,
“Whaddya mean, whaddya
mean?”

Actually my reticence might
be viewed as a case of enor-
mous self—discipline.
Considering that God and the
workings of God are probably
the ultimate mystery of record-
ed time, can you think of a
greater truism than “God works
in mysterious ways?”

Lately, though, I began to
think there may be something
to this circuitous route traveled
by the influence of the
Almighty. My very presence
here at the University of
Pittsburgh and its attendant
world-class medical center
offers personal veracity to the
concept that “God works in
mysterious ways.”

It turns out that I am in des-
perate need of the expertise
offered by the medical staff at
UPMC. After years of denial, I
have recently accepted the fact
that I am afflicted with
Opposite Benefit Choice dis-
ease. While not exactly rare, the
disease is one that is not often
discussed. Opposite Benefit
Choice disease is often referred
to as “Corrigen’s Syndrome,”
named after pioneer aviator
Joseph “Wrong Way” Corrigen,
who, in an attempt to duplicate
Charles Lindbergh’s New York
to Paris transoceanic flight,
wound up landing in San
Francisco.

Opposite Benefit Choice dis-
ease manifests itself like this:
Decisions and choices made by
the infected individual are
almost always directly opposite
the choice that would be best
for the person. Sometimes I
choose not to go to class.
Regular class attendance, how-
ever, is a proven necessity for a
successful academic career. See
how it works? The choices I
(freely) make are almost always
bad for me.

The key to recognizing
“Corrigen’s Syndrome” is to see
the pattern that it sets up, and

James
Zambroski

to attribute it to the disease, not
to some character weakness of
the sufferer. I am not a bad per-
son simply because I have
Corrigen’s Syndrome.

You and I go out to dinner
together. I wind up wishing
that I had ordered what you got
rather than what I’m‘served. My
selection of neckwear brings
tears (of laughter) to the eyes of
the masses. I like a song after
the band who performs it
breaks up. I go to Oscar—win—
ning movies when they’re at
the $2 matinee. Opposite
Beneﬁt Choice disease is in full
bloom.

Then there’s the women I fall
in love with. I meet the girl of
my dreams, and she turns out
to be a frequent flier at Western
Psych. When I want to lose
weight, which is always, I buy
Slim Fast by the case —— I need
it as a chaser for steak and
cheese hoagies. .

How about the major I chose?
I thought I’d be a neuroscien-
tist. I struggled to get C’s in
Chem 1, Physics I and Bio I. In
English and history, I always
got A’s, AND I liked them, but
Opposite Benefit Choice dis-
ease dictated that neither one of
those should be my major.

I'm not even going to discuss

the “if-one-is—good-a—thousand-
must-be-better” phase of this ill-
ness. It really gets ugly when
you talk about doughnuts,
Budweiser and parking tickets.
Yeah, I’ve decided to start a
collection of government docu-
ments — parking tickets.

No one knows why a person
is afﬂicted by Opposite Beneﬁt
Choice disease. We don’t know
whether it’s genetic (could be,
seeing as how my dad did
choose to marry my mom), or
maybe it’s environmental. Is
there something wrong with my
brain or was it the way I was
raised? But coping brings me
back to the “God works in mys-
terious ways” thing. Me being at
this place during this time
seems to be too good a coinci-
dence.

Perhaps there are answers for
me at the UPMC. It’s kind of
depressing to be told that I’m
merely compulsive, that I pro-
crastinate or to be admonished
about being “so anal.” What in
heaven’s name does THAT
mean? When I hear it, I don’t
know whether to laugh or
throw a punch.

I haven’t found a self—help

group yet where I can walk in"

and say, “Hi, my name is James,
and I have Opposite Benefit
Choice disease.” It might be
nice to have fellowship with
others. But, truthfully, going
public with this now has been
somewhat liberating. I should
stop looking at myself as ill and
start viewing myself as “choice-
challenged.” I’m not bad trying
to get good, I’m a sick trying to
get well.

Perhaps now that you know,
you’ll help me.But the next
time we’re together, help my
recovery — you do the choos-
ing. Or at least, don’t laugh at
my tie. God works in mysteri-
ous ways, and, one day at a

make the right choice. By the

The Pitt baseball team gave
an early Easter gift to
Connecticut, and it wasn’t a
chocolate bunny. The Huskies
received a good old-fashioned
whipping, as Pitt swept the
three—game series 12-7, 16-6 and
11-5 last weekend at Trees
Field.

Pitt (155-1) posted its second

consecutive Big East series
sweep, upping the Panthers’ Big
East record to a perfect 6-0.
A “It’s the first time since I’ve
been here,” head coach Mark
Jackson said of the consecutive
sweeps. “It’s probably the first
time ever, I would imagine.”

“We just hope we can keep it
going,” Pitt shortstop Danny
Gonzalez said.

“It’s just one of those things

if — we have to play hard every-

day, and when we play hard,
we play well.”

Good pitching, solid defense
and timely and consistent hit-
ting are the ingredients for a
winning team, and Pitt had
them all last weekend.

In the first game, the
Panthers’ high-powered offense
had to go against one of the
best pitchers in the country,
Husky right—hander John Kelly.

“He has a really bright future,”
Jackson said. ‘

“He’s going to be drafted in

Bravo!

After winning Big East player
and pitcher of the week honors
last week, Pitt third baseman
Josh Tyler and righthander
Gregg Mrochko gave encore
performances in leading the
Panthers’ weekend sweep of
the Connecticut
Huskies.

Tyler, a junior, hit .429 against ~

the Huskies and drove in five
runs, four of his RBI coming on
a grand slam in the fifth inning
of game two.

He also scored four runs and
stole two bases.

His production over the
weekend came a week after he
hit .800 with two home runs,
four RBI, four runs scored and
two stolen bases against Boston
College.

“I’m seeing the ball. It’s com-
ing in real big, and I’m just hit-
ting it,” Tyler said. '

“I don’t know what to say
other than that.”

Mrochko was the winning
pitcher,16—6, in game two,
upping his record to 5-0. He
shut the Huskies out through six
innings on four hits.

But with the Panthers leading
16-0, the Huskies scored six
runs in the top of the seventh
off him.

See Tandem, page 12

DeBernardis’ solo homer tied
the game in the sixth at 5-5, and
then Pitt broke the game open.

Singles by Bob Miller,

«Gonzalez and Scott Etsell’s RBI

single started off the seventh.
Three more singles, coupled
with two walks, was enough to
knock Kelly out of the game.
Pitt’s seven—run explosion was
too much for UConn to come:
See Run, page 13

You might be sick of see-
ing them, but Coach K and
the Duke Blue Devils just
can’t be denied. He has
brought his team to the
championship game four out
of the last five years and
picked up two champi-
onships on the way. No one
expected the overachieving
Devils to make it back again,
but when a team has All-
American Grant Hill as its
leader, anything is possible.

Nolan Richardson’s “40 min-

Clearly the Hogs are the
favorites, but let’s see how
they match up.

Guards: Hogs

No team has ever won a
national championship led
by a rookie point guard.

The probability of him get-
ting hot against the Hogs is
very unlikely, though. If
Duke plays man-to-man
defense, Collins is a «huge lia-

much too quick and athletic

Gant surprised a few people,
but with talent like Ryan Klesko,
Tony Tarasco, Javier Lopez and
Chipper Jones (who will be out
for the season), the Braves GM
John Schuerholz can get away
with moves like this.

Speaking of Lopez, he will
probably get the starting—catcher
job with fan-favorite Gregg
Olson out of the
picture.

This is a very solid team that
has yet to win that elusive
World Series, so they still have
something to prove.

2) Philadelphia Phillies

Look for the Phils to pick up
that wild—card spot if they can
remain relatively healthy like
last year.

Obviously, health is a factor
for every team, but none more
so than for the Phillies, who
have had their share of major
injuries in recent years.

It has already started with first
sacker John Kiuk, who is under-
going radiation treatment for
testicular cancer.

Look for Ricky Jordan to
shine, now that he will finally
get his shot at first.

Also, look for Dave Hollins to
improve on his 18 HRS and 95
RBI and emerge as one of the
premiere third basemen in the
league.

Keep an eye on shortstop
Kevin Stocker, who had a great
second half last year.

Steady catcher “Dutch”
Daulton can also be counted on
for another year of 24 HRS, 105
RBI and 100+ bases-on—balls if
his knees hold up. Finally, you
can’t talk about the Phils with—
out talking about their catalyst,
Lenny “Nails” Dykstra, who is
the glue that holds this team
together. V

Many people, including
myself, were skeptical about the
way Manager Jim Fregosi pla-
tooned his outfield, but you
can’t argue with the numbers
that Pete Incaviglia, Jim
Eisenreich, Milt Thompson and
the now-injured Wes
Chamberlain produced.

Another key for Philadelphia
is the pitching.

You can count on Curt
Schilling and Tommy Greene,
but after that there are just ques-
tions.

\‘~"ill Ben Rivera be able to get
the job done and will Danny

Mrochko was pulled with one
out, and Matt Skokowski got the

game’s final two
outs.

“I don't think I did anything
different,” Mrochko
said.

“What they did was relax.
They knew they were down 16
runs, so they weren’t pressed
and went up there swinging
freely. Stuff like that
happens.”

Seventh-inning garbage aside,
Mrochko’s six shutout innings
came after his award-winning
nine-inning complete—game per-
formance in Pitt’s 12-3 win over
BC last weekend.

“The award gives me a lot of
confidence,” Mrochko said,
“and it shows that our team is
getting some respect."

Awards are something that
Pitt head coach Mark Jackson
has told his players to be cau-
tious of.

“We tell our players that that’s
something to look back on after
the season,” Jackson said.
“Sometimes when you get
awards, it can make you lose
focus.

"You start to think about how
good you’re doing, and that’s
when you forget to do what you
need to do.”

Jackson believes that Tyler
and Mrochko were able to
maintain their focus this week-
end.

“I think Gregg did for the

Take for example the fifth
inning of the second UConn
game.

Tyler led off the inning with a
double and later scored on cen-
ter fielder Bob Miller’s RBI
groundout to short. Later that
same inning, with the bases
juiced, Tyler hit a shot over the
380 sign in center field. Pitt
scored eight runs in the inning,
Tyler accounting for five of
them.

“In those type of situations
you’ve got to step up,” Tyler
said.

“You have to make sure you
get your pitch, and you’ve got
to make things happen.”

Mrochko is a ground—ball
pitcher who can be overpower-
ing.

In his six shutout innings on
Saturday, he only struck out
four batters, getting 10 ground-
ball outs.

But in the BC game last week-
end he struck out 11, getting BC
batters to chase nasty sliders in
the dirt. 

“I’m not worried about
results,” Mrochko said.
“Because if I throw like I did in
the first six innings, the results
will come.”

For the Panthers, 6-0 in Big
East play, results are starting to
come, and if they continue,
expect Mrochko and Tyler to be
leading the curtain
calls.

back from, and boosted Kelly’s
ERA to a staggering 7.24.

Hitting Kelly for all 12 runs is
not something new for the
Panthers.

Last year they scored 10 runs
in two innings off him.

“We probably hit him harder
than any team in the country,”
Jackson said.

UConn squandered two runs
off Pitt reliever Brian Shaffer (2-
2), who pitched ﬁve innings for
the win.

In the second game, it only
took Pitt two innings, the sec-
ond and fifth, to produce 16
runs. In each of the innings, Pitt
batted around the order.

The Panthers introduced
UConn starter Mike Galati to the
showers in the second inning.

With the bases loaded, Kurt
Allen walked and Jason Conti
singled. Two more runs scored,
and then DeBernardis, who
already walked, singled, scoring
Conti. Shantz finished the
inning off with a two—run single.

In the fifth, Pitt erupted again
for eight more runs. Big East
Player-of-the-Week Tyler dou-
bled to lead off the inning and
then crushed a grand slam to
dead center field.

To make matters worse for
the Huskies, the Big East
Pitcher-of—the-Week, Gregg
Mrochko of Pitt, was smoking.
Mrochko took a shutout into the
last inning before UConn rallied
for six garbage runs. Mrochko
struck out four with no walks
for the win (5-0). Matt
Skokowski finished the game.

“I just hit my spots and threw

backcourt. Neither one of
them is offensive-minded,
but they can finish the break
and hit the open three.
Offense is irrelevant with
these two because Arkansas
has other guards who do
that.

Forwards: Tie

Seniors Hill and Antonio
Lang are both going for their
third national title, so experi-
ence is on Duke’s side.
Another thing on Duke’s side
is six—foot-eight-inch Hill. He
does it all: brings the ball up,
scores, passes, rebounds and
is probably the best defen-
sive player in the country.
He even did the impossible
— holding “Big Dog” Glenn
Robinson to 13 points. Hill’s
versatility poses a problem
matching up.

Lang is a lanky 6-8 power
forward who does a tad of
everything, but nothing
spectacular. His most valu-
able contribution is his expe-
rience. But how is his skinny
frame going to do against
Arkansas’ Corliss Williamson?

The sensational sopho-
more frontcourt for the Hogs

might not have the experi-
ence like Duke, but they
have plenty of ability. The
thrust of Arkansas’ high-
powered offense lies with
Scotty Thurman and
Williamson.

Thurman is a streaky
shooter who can score from
anywhere on the floor.
When he gets hot, look out.
At 6-5, he starts as a small
forward, but with all the sub-
stitutions, he often plays
guard.

Williamson is not named
the Big Nasty for nothing.
His unbelievable strength
and quickness makes up for
his 6-7 size in the paint. He is
a rebounding machine, as
Arizona can attest to.

On offense, Williamson is
next to unstoppable. He’ll
post up smaller guys, like
Lang, and he’ll blow by the
bigger guys.

Just as Hill poses a match-
up problem, Williamson is
even a bigger problem. He
may force Duke into playing
more zone than they want
t0.

Center: Duke
See Devils, page 14

The six runs UConn scored in
the seventh sparked some con-
fidence for the final game.

“They got some momentum
for the next game,” Jackson
said.

“If they would have went out
in the seventh 1-2-3, I think they
would have come out a little
ﬂatter.”

The third game proved to be
Pitt’s toughest test. I

UConn scored in the first, but
Pitt came right back to tie in the
bottom half, when Gonzalez
was hit by a pitch and scored on
Et'sell’s double.

The Panthers scored a run in
each of the next two innings.
Shantz collected one of his
three RBI on a double to center
field.

Down 5-3 in the bottom of
the seventh, Pitt managed to
scrap for two runs to tie.
Crawley led off with a single,
and Gonzalez was hit by anoth-
er pitch. DeBernardis grounded

to second, scoring Crawley.’

Shantz scored Gonzalez on an
error by Husky shortstop Keith
Wetjen.

In each of the previous games
Pitt relied on a big inning, and
the eighth was it.

Pinch-hitting for Allen, Ken
Strish led off with a double to
left-center field.

“Coach told me the inning
prior to that I would be pinch-
hitting,” Strish said.

“I’ve been struggling at the
plate, but I’ve been starting for a
long time. lt’s just a matter of
coming around.”

Strish’s double proved to be
key to the Panthers’ sputtering
offense. Pitt rallied for five con-
secutive hits.

Conti followed with a double
and Miller singled. Crawley sin-
gled in Conti, and Gonzalez sin-
gled in Miller.

The rally appeared to be over
with two outs, but Shantz put
the game completely out of
reach with a two-run homer.
Shantz finished the game with
three hits.

A siX—run lead was plenty for
Clayton Beirne (2-0), who
pitched three scoreless innings
of relief work for the win.

Devils "'

Continued from page 13
I know Cherokee Parks
is not fun to watch, but he
always gets the job done.
He is not the most athletic
center, but his court sense
and positioning compen-
sate for it. He did break
the Duke all—time shot-
blocking record. Parks
has a big 6-11 frame
which he uses to body up
down low and possesses
a great shooting touch
from the outside.

Darnell Robinson, 6-11,
was one of the top fresh-
men this year. He was
California’s all-time lead-
ing scorer, but that means
nothing now. Like the rest
of the Hogs, Robinson is
very athletic. In a couple
of years, Robinson would
have the edge, but not
now.

Bench: Hogs!

The bench is what
might decide the differ-
ence of who wins. To put
it mildly, Duke’s bench is
barren. Coach K goes
two, maybe three deep
on the bench. Senior
swingman Marty Clark
contributes but is nothing
special. Erik Meek pro-
vides some help in the
middle.

Arkansas’ bench is hog
wild — going 10 deep.
Richardson has a million
combinations to deal
With.

If he wants to go small,
there is 25-year-old rook-
ie Alex Dillard, whose
range starts when he
walks in the gym and is
never bashful about any
shot.

Jackson come through for them
again? Plus, will they get the
production that they need out
of the fifth spot in the rotation’

Many of the team’s critics feel
that they overachieved last sea-
son and that everything fell into
place for them.

I guess they’ll have to do it
again to make these guys
happy.

3) Montreal Expos

Before we get started, let’s
agree to one thing --— the fact
that the Expos have one of the
game’s most talented and dan-
gerous outfields.

Last year the trio of Marquis
Grissom, Larry Walker and
Moises Alou combined for 59
homers and 266 runs batted in,
not to mention 99 stolen bases
and a pair of Gold Gloves.

Montreal’s infield is not as
dynamic with the trade of
Delino DeShields to the
Dodgers for Pedro Martinez,

which was done by then-

General Manager Dan
Duquette, who has since left
Montreal for the Red Sox.

It is a young infield with
much potential in the likes of
third baseman Sean Berry and
shortstop IV/il Cordero. The big
question in Montreal is whether
or not their pitching will hold
up.

They can count on Ken Hill,
whose 9-7 record last year
doesn’t do him justice, but other
than him they have some ques-
tions.

This is a potentially solid staff,
but they are still young, with the
likes of Martinez, Kirk Reuter
and Jeff Fassero.

However, one consistently
proven commodity» that they do
have is reliever John Wetteland,
who went 9-3 with 43 saves and
a 1.57 ERA last year. Look for
the Expos to keep things inter-
esting in the East this year and
to challenge the Braves and
Phillies.

4) Florida Marlins

The Marlins are slowly build-
ing each year, which is a luxury
that most teams don’t enjoy
since fans want to see a winner
immediately.

They are definitely a few
years away but this current team
should not be laughed
at.

Right off the bat they have
two locks to appear in
Pittsburgh for this year’s All—Star
game: right fielder Gary
Sheffield and catcher Benito

Santiago. They also have the
power-hitting Orestes Destrade
(.255 BA, 20 HRS, 87 RBI) at
first, and at the other corner of
the infield they have Dave
Magadan.

I think that Magadan will have
a solid year and return to the
.300 batting average form that
he was known for in New York

Don’t forget about the other

the outﬁeld with at Joe Robbie

while Carr stole 53 bases and
appeared on ESPN’s “Plays of
the Week” on a regular basis.

The big question mark here
is the pitching staff, which still
includes the ageless knuckle-
baller Charlie Hough.

Ryan Bowen and Chris
Hammond were their big guns
last year and showed some

promise.

The one-man bullpen of
Brian Harvey with his 45 saves
and 1.70 ERA is definitely trad-
ing bait.

Maybe GM Dave Dombroski
should give Lee Thomas a call
in Philly.

5) New York Mets

Let’s be honest, other then

Bobby Bonilla, the Mets are
horrible.

This is definitely a team that
has slowly deteriorated since
1986.

I hate to bring up the past
but this season their outfield
could have been Dykstra,
Strawberry and Mitchell.

Their inﬁeld could have con-

sisted of Howard Johnson,
Gregg Jefferies, along with
Bonilla and maybe Eddie
Murray, who by the way can
still produce offensively at age
38.

The Mets had a dynasty on
their hands.

Now they have a last-place
team.
