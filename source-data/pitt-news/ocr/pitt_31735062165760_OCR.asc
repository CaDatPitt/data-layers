_ Speculation among the students and faculty concerning
‘ the large percentage of freshmen on probation should be

‘ignored according to Assistant

dean Russel A. Dixon, head of

the probation program. Final tabulations concerning the per-

Dean Dixon went on to explain
“that in his opinion speculations
are largely the result of conversa-
tions at fraternity parties. The
rumors are just a part of college

, life, added Dixon.

Number Not Excessive
He explained that to his knowl-
edge, the proportion of students
on probation is not excessive as

.'“'._,compared with previous years.
5  From the statistics available at

this time, Dixon believes the total
number ofstudents on probation
in the School oi the Liberal Arts
‘is slightly in excess of 500.
Commenting further, Dixon
stated that he thinks fraterni-
ties are one of the greatest fac-
tors involved in putting boys on
probation. He believes students
, spend too much time on frateri-
ties, and not enough time study-
_ing.
-. Dean N. Ronald Pease, assistant

~_de-an’ of men for student affairs,

Vstated that in_ some cases, de-
pending on thegindividual, parti-
cipation in fraternities is detri-

”.’mental to the student’s scholastic

record.
— No Scapegoats
However, Dean Pease stated, “I
do not feel that fraternities should
be used as a scapegoat for such
"matters.”v Pease said that many
students do hurt themselves by
‘ioverparticipation in social affairs.
“If the fraternities were not here,
these students would ﬁnd some
other aspect of social life with
which to pass the time.

Dean Helen P. Rush, dean of
women and students, adds.
“From all indications, the num-
ber of women students on pro-
bation is not unreasonable.”
‘When asked why many of the

" students ﬁnd themselves on, pro-
bation, Dean Rush replied, “Some

..-of the students simply do not

wakeup to the fact that they have
to study.” Some "students who
start out on probation end up as
‘honor students, she said.

Wrong Choices

Some students try to prepare
for careers for which they have

,no talent. These students should

change to areas where they excel],

1 Miss Rush said.

A Dean William B. Crafts, dean
of men, explained that many of
the freshmen are on probation
because most of them have not
developed a sense of purpose.
“These students discover after
they get here that they“ do not
have sufficient motivation.”

, Most students probably are not
challenged in high school, Crafts
. believes.

“Academic pressures seem to be
:-increasing year ‘by year,” he
stated. -
According to Crafts fraternities
should not be considered greatly
as a cause of students going on
“probation. “If a student does not
draw the line wisely,” he said, “he
.may ﬁnd his interests are in the
-wrong place.” '

Honors Dinner, Trimester Queries Discussed

SG Plans ‘Znd Pitt Preview

By JOSEY GROTSSMAN

Tentative plans for the
second, annual Pitt Preview,
March 16 and 23, -are out-
lined, according to Student
Government president Tom
Olofson. Students will assist

the administration in introducing
prospective freshmen to the Uni-
versity. '

After an administrative com-
mittee meeting, Dean of Students
and Pitt Preview advisor Helen
P. Rush reported the plans to
Olofson. He will appoint co—chair-I
men this week. '

Newt Chairmen Meet

The new co—chairmen will meet
on Friday‘ at 4 p.m. with last
year’s co-cha"irmen-Bob Rowley
and Kitty Kitson—-Olofson, SG
vice-president Judy Diethorn, Miss
Rush and members of the admin-
istration, and the vice—presidents
of the seven groups represented
in the senate.

Both SG and \the administra-
tive committee will assist at
the Pitt Preview co-chairmen
in this executive wing project.

The senate then Voted to’ honor

the University scholars ;with a’

dinner after Honors Convocation
on March 14. ‘fstudents choose
students on Tap Day,” Olofson
explained; “the faculty picks the
scholars foiﬁthe Honors Convoca-
tion. Before this University schol-
ars were not formally recognized
by the students.”
Administrators Attend

Olofson suggested that “per-
haps the Honors Convrvvntion
speaker, Chancellor i'_.itc'x._""', and
other administrators

with 4.0 grade averages.

Olofson further reported that
the investigation of the trimes-
ter committee is complete ex-
cept for the student question-
naire. Next week the commit-
tee wil-l_.meet with the ‘staff of
Policy Planning and Co-ord_ina-
tion to discuss the ﬁnal draft.

The questionnaires, which will
be sent to about 2000 students
with letters from SG, will. be
evaluated and incorporated into
the ‘final report. “Olofson hopes

that the ﬁnal report will be ready

‘ Two Areas of Life
The completed inv_estigation,
Olofson emphasizes, “strictly from

a student standpoint,” involves
two areas of student 1ife-aca-
demic and social. Subcommittees

examined the quality and type of
course offerings and faculty, com-
paring the statictics of the sum-
mer term to those of the fall and
winter. P -

They likewise compared ex-
ltra-curricular activity and types
of organizational activity in the
winter and summer months.
The available physical facilities
also stood investigation.

“We could have stopped with
this extensive investigation,” Olof-
son commented, “but the report
will be ﬁner and will hold more-
weight with the University com-
munity with the added support
of the questionnaire.”

Access to Computors

The committee originally plan-
ned a small scale survey of stu-
dent opinion, but has since gained
access to the University comput-

data. .

The senators then chose the
last three weeks in February,
Feb. 10 to March 2, to test the
proposed library hours._ Alan
Rankin, assistant chancellor of
student and generalaffairs, sug-
gested this means to evaluate
the plan.

Small Loss

Director of Finance Dick Minker
reported an , approximate ten ‘dol-
lar loss on the student directories
and made several recommenda-
tions for next year’s production.
The directories should sell for 50
cents instead of 35 cents he sug-
gested, and SG should order 1250

of 500.

Cluttered around Edward Mc-
Kernean’s desk in the check room
of"the basement of the Cathe-
dral are books; clothing, jewel-
ry, and other articles lost by stu-
dents. “If the ‘clothing isn’t
claimed within a year,” said Me-
Kernean, “it is usually given to
the Salvation Army. Some of the
books, jewelry, and glasses have
‘been here for years,” said the
head of the check room.”

In one corner of_ the ‘check
room some of the shelves con-
tain gla/sses
sizes, green, red, and blue mit-

tens, a pile of keys, slide rules
in leather cases, and plaid um-
brellas. Other shelves contain a
"small library of unclaimed books
on almost any subject. In another
corner a locked brown cabinet
holds, a treasure of class rings,
bracelets, and necklaces. Beside
the cabinet are a bouquet of
flowers and a pair of crutches
that have been there for years.

McKernean said, “I would like
the students that lost the articles

to come and claim them.” He

i Contest -

The decision of Student Government to sponsor an
academic achievement competition is a highly commend-
able one. The structure of the contest is also praiseworthy
‘ ‘in that it allows practically every student to. ﬁnd some area

of interest in which he can build a project for the competi-
 tionj
With the purpose of stimulating some atmosphereof
, academic competition, the contest provides the opportunity‘
“for students to be judged publicly on the basis of their in-
ltellectual accomplishments and creativeability;,.this gen-
erally happens only in theclassroom, where onelinstructor
lfevaluates studentwork, or “out inthe world,” whereone’s
progress in business is evaluated by an employer.
Theljudges for the competition are exceptional in that

 they are known for /being adroit critics as well as instruc-

tors. They represent many different kinds of thinking on
‘campus and their ‘winning selections -should’ be‘ truly
"superior student work. ,
, Teachers are urged to single out students whom the
,, feel may qualify for the contest and the students them-
-selves should have no qualms about entering any type of

” _ paper in this unusual and stimulating competition.

j   Conflict  

/
The smoke has settled over Dr. Douglass Thompson
‘and his vending machine poster campaign —- for the time
being. Pressure from some level or levels of the tobacco
industry complex has succeeded in causing the determined
doctor to dismount his cancer warnings from the machines
and move them to the nearest wall space.

It is also felt that the new administration of Auxiliary
enterprises is not as excited about the campaign as its

_predecessor has been, which is perhaps a further harass-
ment’to the Health Service Director.

But the set-back should not stop Thompson, as this
project has been his pet for quite some time.’ We are sure
that he will soon retaliate with a new point of attack on
college smokers.

vquestion left for the students to

    

Student Government. took a big chance last
January, setting up-a referendum where under-
graduates could have chosen to vote it out" of
existence. At that time SG was under attack from
many groups and individuals,
criticism centering around al-
leged, ineffectiveness. Whether
or not to continue SG [was a

decide. Without their support
SG could ,.not continue" its
existence, ‘and could never be_
taken seriously’ by faculty, ad-
ministrators, or students. Sup-
port was given, although very 1 er
weak, and now, aftertwo tri— 
mesters of operation under the .

 

. Representative Plan, ‘SG has shown that it merits

serious student support and real respect from
the administration.

There were four choices during last February’s
referendum. Students could vote to abolish SG,
continue it as it had been operating, or’ reorganize
it under either the President’s or Representatives’

Plan. ‘The Representatives’ Plan was accepted. 290
. students favored it,/170 preferred the President’s

Plan, 26 felt no change was necessary, and 258
wanted SG disbanded.
Didn't Insure Support“ V

Elections in March did nothing to assure SG
of increased student support. Of ‘fourcandidates,
for the ofiices of president and vice president one,
a _write—in,.was ineligible. Tom Olofson, the lone
eligible presidential candidate, received 529 votes.
His running jmate on the Representatives’ Party
slate, Judy Diethorn, edged out independent vp
candidate, Ruth Maguire, by 45 votes.’  A

The lack of interest-shownby both the referen-
dumland election turnouts didn’t give thenew‘ Stu-
dent Government mu_ch hope for a better fate than
its predecessor, but Tom Olofson, at the first meet-
ing, urged senators “to. understand‘ the needs and
wants of the -students.’‘’ The spring trimester is

always comparativelyﬁlquiet as far as organized ac-.

tivities are concerned. SG was no exception. .Per—

haps thelull gave senators and ofﬁcers a, chance‘

for needed orientation and study into the problems
they would face." When the. '_fall trimester began,
SG was operating in style, for a change.

By Barry Gross

Two book exchanges have proven immensely
successful. SG sent welcome letters to freshmen,

. urginglthem to consider participating in one of

the many extra-curricular activities on campus, in-
cluding SG itself. SG assisted in both Freshman
Outing and sales,of« Polaris as usual, but with

better results. Showing imagination and initiative,_

SG revived the Pitt Chest, issued a much-needed
Student Directory, and formed a‘ Foreign Student
Service Committee.

I They obtained the clear student consensus on
the Alcohol Proposal that was needed before the

"administration would consider turning the campus

“wet”; they protected students from the possibility
of expensive ID cards by submitting an inexpen-
sive plan of their own; they arranged for the cafe-
teria to betopen for studying during Finals Week;
they are planning toaid the alumni in recruiting
new students; and they are conducting an im-
portant analysis of the trimester system.

Thus, the new’Student Government nas gone
beyond its usual activities of participation in events
such as Homecoming. It has performed genuine
services for students -— note the Book Exchange
and the Student Directory —=— and has started to
interpret and clarify student opinions on important
matters, the alcohol poll, for example. Projects
of this type are certainly the basis for a strong
§tudent government.‘ Undergraduates who have
been aided by any of these projects should realize
that added student support "will result in added
SG competence. ' ' '

Something Else 'l'o Consider

Student support can be manifested by more
than participation in SG sponsorediservices. New
elections will be held in aifew months. Besides the
too-often-ignored responsibility of voting, students

have something else to consider. Being‘ an SG,

senator is no longer anything to be ashamed of and

new leaders are always needed. From the many

competent and exceptional undergraduates on cam-
pus, enough should decide to join SG to replenish
losses of graduating seniors. ' . .

A strong and effective Student‘ Government can

, carry student ‘opinion to_the.adr,nini'stration. .And

these opinions, presented by a Student,Government
that can operate effe'ctivély, willtbeg-considered in
a different light than various mutterings from un-
organized individuals. ’

Srnoldering Campaign

   PosteriFo||y

Earlier this week, Dr. Douglass Thompson, di-
rector of the Student Health Service, told a repre-
sentative of The Pitt News that the poster cam-
paign against cigarette smoking on campus was
being handled — so tospeak -
“out of the left rear pocket of
the Health Service,” and that it
was really the brain child of
Auxiliary Enterprises.

However, to most students
who are in anyway familiar with
Dr. Thompson’s views on’ the
matter, it is his campaign and
his alone. And this is perhaps
unfortunate, because Dr. Thomp-
son has some interesting facts at
his disposal, but the manner in
which he has chosen to present them to the student
body clearly demonstrates a lack of human uncler—
standing.

In the first place, Dr. Thompson — or Auxiliary

Enterprises, if you prefer —- has not evaluated the
situation correctly. For this campaign to have any
positive effects, the anti—smoking signs must be
read, and carefully thought over, by the students.
No'l' the Case Here

This is, therefore, an assumption on the part
of Dr. Thompson that students are normal, rational
thinking human beings. Such, however, is not the
case at this University.

Students on this campus are apathetic when
left alone and antagonistic when arroused. There
is no middle ground left for thoughtful contem-
plation. Either students won’t pay the least at-
tention to the signs or else they’ll become vehe-
ment and demand their removal on the grounds
of insulting student intelligence.

Dr. Thompson also believes that the greatest
beneﬁt of this campaign will not be to discourage
those already smoking, but from the use,of the

£‘J?.%~¥

  
 

 

  
  

By Mail‘ Swefonic

This is yet another misconception on the part
of the good‘ doctor. If the student has not started

2 smoking before he comes to college, it is for one of

two reasons First, he does. not like‘to_ smoke or
second, hisjparents did not permit him to smoke
while he was living at home.

"'If the ﬁrst assumption is true, then that student,

is not going to smoke anyway and the signs ’are
useless, andeif the second be true, then he is going
to smoke anyway, because Dr. Thompson is to him,
just another manifestation of'his restrictive parents.
Also. a large number of non-smokers begin to

_ Smoke when they come to college because it is the
thing to do. In this case, the signs will also fail to 7

have their desired effect. f

If the signs are therefore not going to be pro-
ductive, what can be done to promotethe anti-
smokmg campaign? Nothing! If Auxiliary decides
to print up hand-outs outlining the dangers of

" cigarette smoking and distribute them to" students

on their way to classes, the students will react in
the same manner as they always have — they will
throw them away.
Next Obvious Way

The next obvious way of getting through to the
students would be to solicit the assistance of The
Pitt News to foster the campaign, but why should
a paper which gets one third of its revenue from
cigarette advertising advocate the discontinuence
of buying cigarettes on campus. This is surely not a
realistic approach.

A last possibility would be the removal from

campus of all cigarette machines followed by an _

administrative decree forbidding the smoking of
cigarettes anywhere on University property, Such
action, however, would be inviting wholesale revolt
and Dr. Thompson realizes, I believe, that such
"would be the case.

What ‘this an goes to prove is simply this, -Dr.

Thompson has placedhis faith in a bunch of signs .1‘

University Physicists Attend Warsaw Meeting

Gravitation Report Prepared

  

-\..

By MARCIA BERNSTEIN

Results of recent work in the study of gravitation were
reported at a conference on theoretical studies in gravitation
and the experimental veriﬁcation of these theories.

University Physics instructor, Dr. John J. Stachel, at-
tended this conference on Gravitational Research in Warsaw
during July, 1962; he remained until December as a member

L of the editorial committee to com— 39",

plete the report on the proceed-

‘ ings of the conference.

Dr. Allen Janis and Dr. Ezra
N e w m a n . University associate

- professors of physics, also attend-

   

ed the conference, but did not

in Warsaw.
Based on Einstein

The main theoretical work be-
ing done now in this field is based
on Einstein’s theory of relativity
and its development.

Recent interest in gravitation
stems from the developments in
mathematics which have given
physicists a better understand-
ing’ of the highly complicated
gravitational equations.

Einstein's original work on

remain

’ gravitational research was start-

ed about 1912. ‘During the 1930's
to the 1950's, the quantum theory
was of major interest in theo-
retical physics. During the last
decade, however, there has been
a noticeable regrowth of interest
research.
Led People Back

“Unsolved theoretical problems
in quantum theory have led peo-
ple back to the gravitation rela-
tivity thcory for help in solving
these problems,” stated Dr. Stac-
hel.

At the conference there was a
free flow of information be-
tween phyeisists of the various
nations. This did not surprise
lDr. Stachel, as he had previ-
ously spoken to a group of P0-
lish scientists when they were
in the U.S. and knew what to
expect.

According to Dr. Stachel “there
was a line group of younger Pol-
ish people at the conference, in-

cluding many women, and in
theoretical physics in general.
,“Onc noticed, however, that a

whole generation was missing.”
Little Done in Poland

When various professors re-
turned to Poland, there was vir-
tually no work being carried on
there in theoretical physics There
had not been too much work done
on the subject -before the war.
During the war, whatever there
was. was clisperscd.

The Institute was built up
from a one to two man group to
one oi’ the largest institutions of
theoretical physics in the world.
It has become one of the centers
of research in relativity the-
ory.

While in Warsaw, Dr. Stachel
gave a series of lectures at the
Institute of Theoretical Physics at
Warsaw as a guest of the insti-
tute.

,DK. JOHN J. STACHEL
Reports on Conference

Dr. Stachel first became inter-
ested in the theory ofigravltation
at Steven’s Institute of Technol-
ogy while doing his graduate
work there under Professors
Schiller, Anderson, and Finkles-
tein, all three of whom were at
the conference.

He had been a math-physics
major while an undergraduate
at the City College of New York.
Dr.«,Stachel says that he “was
always interested ‘in theoretical
physics.”

While talking about physics, Dr.
Stachel threw in Einstein’s deﬁ-
nition of a theoretical physicist:
“a philosopher in working
clothes.” '

WEST POINT -— Daryl F.
Zanuck wasted his money
when he went to the beaches
of Normandy to ﬁlm “The
Longest Day.”

He would have made a wise —

although somewhat queasy —- in-
vestment had he just traveled
with the Panther basketball team
this weekend. Their timetable
threatened to give Jules Verne’s
itinarary a run" for its money.

The game with Arm_y went into
two overtimes before the Panthers

could escape with their 11th of
the year, 79-73.
Just Awaiting
But the extra ten minutes of

basketball were inevitable after
the hectic road experience of the
team. They spent two hours at
Greater Pittsburgh Airport on
Friday night waiting for weather
conditions to improve.
' They never did. The team
rose at 6 a,m. Saturday and
didn’t get off the ground unitl
10:30 a.m. It took them two
‘hours to get here. It took them
ﬁve hours in the air to return

.,_, Basketball Team Stars in ‘Th

to Pittsburgh, because the plane
was bucking severe headwinds.
Many of the passengers became
ill enroute.

The only consolation, of course,
was the much-delayed win. The
chance to be a hero doesn’t come
very often, but it came twice to
Cal Sheffield in this victory.

Sheﬂield Stars

With only nine seconds left in
the ﬁrst overtime, Sheffield had
a one-and-one free throw situa-
tion with the score knotted, 65-65.
He missed_ and the game went into

overtime. But in the second extra

period, he converted eight foul
shots in a row, scoring the team’s
last eight points.

“It was great pressure ball-
playing,” said Coach George
Hunter of Army.

The offcials called 31 fouls
against the Panthers. But the
Cadets only made 23 of 40. The
winners meanwhile converted '27
of 34 chances.— Sheffield was high
man-with’ 18 points.

Lose Starters

The Panthers won the game
with three regulars on the bench:
Dave Roman, Paul -Krieger an
Tim ‘ Grgurich. '

..(

, _ Monday, January 21, 1963 l—.'l‘lllE rrrr’_N1:ws — rm, 9' 

eLongest Day’

When Grgurich left in the
first overtime, Coach Bob Tim-U
mons inserted John “Dink”
Larkin, who promptly hit two
free throws to push the team
ahead "by four points and later‘
grabbed a crucial rebound. His
close defensive play resulted in
two jump balls.

The game wento into overtime 6

when Army scored a layup with
a second remaining, tying the

score, 56-56. Eight seconds earlier -

Brian Generalovich had made two
foul shots, which looked like vic-

tory shots, but the ﬁght had just

begun. .

Big Men Come‘ Through For Matmen

Hockey Tickets
Still" Available
At Desks Here

The Student Desks will
continue tosell tickets to the
Pittsburgh Hornets hockey
games at ‘-reduced rates, ac-
cording to Dr. Alan ‘C. Rankin,

the assistant ‘chancellor in

charge of student affairs.

The point was raised by The
Pitt News about the sale [of the
tickets since the_ dates clash with
University—spon.sored- a t h l e t i c

It was the opinion of the Stu— 1

dent Affairs staﬂ that the conflict
of events,~basketball and. hockey
was an example of “diversiﬁed
activities available to students in
an urban university.”
Willing to Pay _

“The fact that the students
were willing to /pay for the
hockey tickets, when they, could
have attended the"basketbal1

game at no cost,” said Dr. Rankin,

“ind_icate'd a preference ‘in enter-
tainment at that time.”

‘Dr. Rankin said there, are ap-
parently few signs, advertising
University athletic" events. 4

He said that signs or. small
posters at the desk advertise‘ tick-

to “push” attendance at athletic

full willingness to do so.

Trailing 8-5 going into the 157—pound match, things look-

would have put the Panthers out

I agai

 if Brings Harrison Wins

CONSISTENT CAPTAIN Jim Harrison is the pillar upon which
the Panther wrestling team must be supported for strength this year.
llarrison has posted an undefeated record thus far for two seasons
iﬁual meet competition although he has been tied twice. I

IJ67-Pounder l

Steady Winner

For Rex Peery, - 

By BOB SMIZIK ‘

Sophomore wrestlers John:
Carr and Mike Johnson, with

their daring offensive styles
‘have apparently become the

favorites of Panther wrestling
fans, while undefeated Jim
Harrison goes almost unnoticed.

This is not surprising because}
Harrison has, according to Coach‘
Rex Peery, “a conservative style
of wrestling. He's very consistent
and" dependable, if not spectac-
ular,” the coach added.

This conservative style of wres-l
tling brought Harrison an unde-
feated 8-0-1 record last year and
a 2-0-1 mark this campaign.

Typical Wins

His wins over Rick Bay of
Michigan and Iowa State's Larry
Hochhaus are typical of Harri-
son's style of wrestling. He beat
Bay, 3-1 and Hochhaus, 5-0.
Though the scores seem_ fairly
close the actual matches were not.

As in almost all his matches
Harrison was in full control as
shown by the better than six
minutes riding time he had

 

against Hochhaus. the B i g
Eight’s number t h r e e 167
pounder.

The fact that Harrison gave up
but 12 points in nine matches is
another indication of his style of
wi‘est1ing.

Walks Backwards

The only blemish on Harrison's
record this year came in a tie
with Syracuse's Gary Sirota, 4-4.
Peery was miffed over Sirota's
style of’ wrestling and said, “the
only step forward Sirota took dur-
ing the whole match was to shake
hands and pass by.” According to
Peery, “Sirota did a good job of
staying away from Jim that day,"

Harrison will probably get an-
other chance at Sirota in the East-
ern championships and most like-
ly ir the finals. Harrison beat his
Syracuse rival twice last year and
Perry is certain he will do it
again.

Harrison profits well from his
mistakes and isn’t likely to let
Sirota get the advantage of him

p.m. on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
The women’s classes will be from

1l:30'a.m. to 12:30 p.m. on the’

same days.

As with other activities of this
type, the student must pay a

llFrief§shman Wrestlers Grow Restless

Here Without Regular Schedule

Beginning in September of 1963 there will be no more

I intercollegiate athletic contests

for freshmen teams here. This

will mean little to the fresh wrestling squad, however, since
that team has not had a dual meet since 1961.

The wrestlers were not exempted earlier than other
sports, it was just that didn’t have enough participants to

schedule a match. The
things hold true this year.

Coach Rex Peery has only four
freshmen" wrestlers out for the
team, ﬁve short of, being enough
to have a dual meet.

This has not stoppedthe four,
Dave. Cleary, Dino Boni, Tdny
Liberati ‘and Clair Riley from

Cleary, a 137-pounder, . made
a spectacular showing in his de-

Tournament. Wrestling against
some ‘of the ﬁnest wrestlers in
the East, Cleary copped the
Wilkes 137-pound title.

To make the feat more out-
standing, Cleary defeated Bethel

same¢

Greenhalgh of Syracuse in the

finals. Greenhalgh tied Mike

Johnson in a dual meet, so thg. _;
future for Cleary seems nothing

but bright.

.Pe,ery thought enough of 147-
pound Boni to take him to the

Pan-American Game trials where _

he was eliminated after three

' matches. -
Liberati, a 123-pounder, was .

eliminated in his first match at
Wilkes and Riley injured his
knee early in the season and did
not participate.

Peery hopes to take all four of J

the freshmen to the West Point
Tournament for Freshmen later in
the season.

Sammies, Sigs
Easy Wiliners

in Greek Loop

By NIARV ZELKOVVITZ
The Intra-fraternity basket-
ball League had its ﬁrst
round of games last Week at
the stadium gym. There were
‘no surprises in the games as

« all of the strong teams won.

Sigma Alpha Mu defeated Zeta
Tau, 38-33. Phi Epsilon Pi de-
feated Theta Chi, 8l-74; Pi

A Lamda Phi edged Pi Kappa Alpha,

63-58, and Delta Sigma Phi de-
feated Sigma Chi, 64-54.

Despite the score, the Saizimies
had an easy night against ZBT.
The‘ Sammies were ahead by 10
points through most of the game,

and used substitutes extensively,

Art Weinstein led the Sammies
in scoring with 14 points. Mike
Stiglitz, a ZBT forward, gave the
Sammies the most trouble with
his rebounding.

‘Coast Home

The Phi Ep’s coasted to their
victory over Theta Chi, as the ﬁrst
unit pulled ahead of Theta Chi
by 20 points in the first half. Phi
Ep’s secondary units contained
Theta Chi in the second half.

Randy Werrin, a Phi Ep for-
ward, highlighted the Phi Ep
attack with good shooting and

rebounding. .

The PiKas had the edge on the
boards, but couldn’t overcome the
sharp shooting and ball handling
of Marty Smith and Bob Moses.
Smith’s 19 points, and Moses’s
ﬁne all-around play kept the Pi
Lams ahead through most or La.
contest, although, Garry" Cherry
scored 19_points for the losers.

The game "was close until the
third period, when. the Pikas
had to start fouling to stop the

Pi Lam attack. The victors at-

tained a 15 point lead, and

maintained it for the rest of
the game. _

The Delta Sig’s first unit played

only the first and third quarters '

in their game with Sigma Chi.
John Jenkins and John 'Pignetti
led the scoring with 13 points
apiece. The high scorer in the
game however, was Dan Picciano
a Sig Chiforward who amassed
20 points.

, INFERIORITY CAN BE FUN

The second gravest problem confronting college students to- A

day is inferiority feelings. (The ﬁrst gravest problem is of
course, the recent outbreak of moult among sorority house

canaries.) Let us today look into the causes of inferiority

feelings and their possible cures.

tPsycl_iologists divide inferiority feelings into three principal
categories: , .

-1. Physical inferiority.

2. Mental inferiority.

3. Financial inferiority. « .

_ (A few say there is also a fourth category: iclitliyological
1nferi0rity—a feeling that other people have prettier ﬁsh--A
but I believe this is common only along the coasts and in the
Great Lakes area.) i _

Let us start with the feeling of physical inferiority, perhaps
the easiest to understand. Naturally we are inclined to feel
mferior to the brawny football captain or the beautiful home-
coming queen. But we should not. Look at all the people,
neither brawny nor beautiful, who have made their marks in

Caesar. Look at "Lassie.

 

“tie arr //it/if/Ea’ fa /eel ‘ / ‘

_What I mean is that you ca.n’l3\always tell what’s' inside a
package by looking at t-he outside. (Sometimes, of course, you
can. Take Marlboro Cigarettes, for example. Just one glance
at that jolly red-and—white package—so bright and pert —— so
neat but not gaudy——so perfectly in place whether you are at
a formal dinner or a beach picnic—so invariably correct for
any time, clinic, or coi1dition—one look, I say, at this paragon
of packs and you know it has to contain cigarettes of absolute
perfection. And you are right! That pure white Marlboro
ﬁlter, that ﬁne, ﬂavorful blend of .Marlboro tobaccos, will
give you a smoke to make the welkin ring, whatever that is.
So those of you who have just been sitting and admiring your
Marlboro packs since the beginning of the semester, why don’t
you open a pack and light one? Light a cigarette, I mean-
not the package. Then you can settle back and smoke your
Marlboro and, at the same time, continue to gaze rapturously
at the pack. Thus you will be twice as happy as you are if
that is possible.) '
But I digress. Let us turn now to the second category—-

mental inferiority. A lot of people think they are diimb_er than “

other people. This is not so. It must be reineinbered that there_
are diﬂerent kinds of intelligence. Take, for instance, the clas-

c case of the Sigafoos brothers, Claude and Sturbridge, stu-
dents at Wake Forest. It was always assumed that Claude was
the more intelligent just because he knew more than Stur-
bridge about tjic arts, the sciences, the social sciences, the hu-
manities,'and like that. Sturbridge, on the other hand, was ten
times smarter than Claude when it came to tying granny knots.
But no matter; everybody looked down on “Stupid Sturbridge,”
as they called him and looked up at “Clever Claude,” as they
called him. But who do you think turned out to be the smart
one when their granny almost got loose and ran away? You
guessed it-—good old Stupid Sturbridge. ‘

We arrive now at the final category, ﬁnancial inferiority.
One way to deal with this condition is to increase your income.
You can, for example, become a fence. Or you can pose for 21
life class, if your college is well heated.

But a better way to handle ﬁnancial inferiority is to accept
it philosophically. Look on the bright side of poverty. True,
others may have more money than you have, but look at all
the things you have that they don’t—debts, for instance, and
hunger cramps. ,

And what about fiiendsliip‘? You don’t need money to have
friends, and let me tell you something, good people: the older
you get the more you will realize that nothing is so precious as
friendship, and the richest man in the world is the one with

the most money. @1003 Max simimaun
