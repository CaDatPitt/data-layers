The information superhighway is
turning into Easy Street for high school
and college students searching for an
A—quality term paper. This is due to an
explosion of websites that offer papers
for little or no cost.

Two of the more popular term
paper depositories, School Sucks and
the Evil House of Cheat, each reported
some 1.2 million visits since their sites
opened.

Houston—based Kenny Sahr, the
creator of School Sucks, began oﬂ°er—
ing papers free of charge online about
18 months ago. The popularity of the
site, he said, is due in a large part to col-
lege professors spreading information
about Sahr’s site to the media

“It made a crucial difference,” said
Sahr. “I expected the media to jump in
and educators to overreact.”

Despite the popularity of his site
and the free-for—the-taking term papers,
he said he is actually helping to bring
about a positive change in the educa-
tion system.

“Checks and balances are missing

— in teaching. Instead, you have tenure,”

he said. “It’s not our best and brightest
going into teaching; it’s our mediocre
and average. [Students] need this
[quality teachers].

“Most [college] teachers don’t
even have a minor in education,” Sahr
added.

Despite what many people think,
he said he doesn’t condone cheating
and plagiarism.

In statistics compiled by a usage-
tracking company contracted by
School Sucks, Duke University had the
highest number of students in terms of
students visiting School Sucks, accord-
ing to a November report.

The Rochester Institute of
Technology and Pennsylvania State
University ﬁlled the second and third
slots, respectively.

The University of Pittsburgh was
not listed among the top 10.

Educators from the University of
Pemrsylvania, California Institute of
Technology, and Oklahoma State
University who publicly criticized Sahr
and School Sucks on his website did
not retum requests for comment.

For The Pitt News

Weaving her paddle back and forth,
Kim Niklewics struck her way toward
her second table-tennis title this
Saturday.

Niklewics, a Pitt junior from
Rochester, N.Y., defended her crown by
defeating the University of Maryland’s
Quin Huang, who grudgingly conceded
that ‘Niklewics, who beat her in straight
sets “was a good player.  She really
knows her game.”

The University of Pittsburgh partic-

ipated in the Association of College
Unions International Division IV
Recreational Tournament in both the
men’s and women’s table tennis and bil-
liards (nine-ball) toumaments at Towson
State University in Towson, Md.
Niklewics, who went undefeated

-over the weekend, will now go on to

represent both Pitt and Division IV
(which includes Pennsylvania, Virginia,
Virginia, Maryland and
Washington, D.C.) in the national tour-
nament at the University of Houston in
April.
When asked about her performance,
Nildewics said that she thought she
played well but added that the players on
the national level were “incredible.”

Also doing well in the women’s
events was Pitt student Lauren Benner,
playing in the nine-ball tournament, who
came back from an early loss in the dou-
ble-elimination tournament and narrow-
ly lost the final to Cinelandia Perreaux
(7-3) of Shippensburg University.
Consequently, Benner placed second.

Benner, who qualiﬁed for the
ACUI’s National Billiards title in Green
Bay, WlS., jokingly complained, “When
I play well, I lose, and when I play hor-
ribly, I somehow manage to win.”

The Pitt men, while not doing as

in both events.

In the men’s table tennis results, Pitt .
student Irfan Ulan of Malaysia managed '

to reach the semifinals before being

beaten by Richard Lee of John Hopkins A
University. He tied for third place with a

strong, deceptive serve and praying
mantis—1ike agility.

Ulan, who has been playing since _
the ﬁfth grade and has competed in sev- ‘
eral tournaments in Malaysia, said he 
was happy to be in the tournament but
that “the competition was too tough for 1
me.” Ulan’s placement qualiﬁed him for p

the national tournament.

In men’s billiards,
Griffiths, the University of Pittsburgh’s
champion, was the top finisher from Pitt,
placing ﬁfth. ‘

Griffiths, however, was not disap-
pointed by the loss.

School of Social Work

Poet deals with being
  black but looking white

-On the first day of second
grade, Toi Denicotte was asked to
ﬁll out a personal history card for
her teacher. At the bottom of the
card, she saw two boxes with the
words “negro” and “white” next to
them.

She contemplated which one
to check, hesitating as long as she
could.

Finally, she checked “negro.”
And, in her book, she recognized
this as one of her ﬁrst encounters
with race.

“By the time I was in second
grade, I already knew that white
people had something special,
desirable, a world I wanted to
enter,” she wrote.

What she didn’t realize then
was that she could enter that
world, but it wouldn’t be as desir-
able to her as she once imagined.
She also didn’t realize that years
later, she would sit down and pull
this memory from the depths of
her mind to include in a best-se1l-
ing novel.

Denicotte is a poetry profes-
sor at Pitt and the author of the
recently published “The Black
Noteboo  which takes the read-
er through her life as a light-
skinned black American. The
book, acclaimed by the
Washington Post, recently won the
Black Caucus of the American
Library Association Literary
Award, one of the highest
American awards for black litera-
me. I
Denicotte said the book was
troubling to write because of the
hurt she suffered throughout her
life over her skin color. In the
book, she writes of her struggles
with herself and her family
because of her light skin.

“It’s very difficult to write
about it,” said Denicotte. “You
don’t want to remember certain
things.” I

In “Ihe Black Notebooks,”
which took over 20 years to write,
Denicotte draws a picture of her
life through individual stories and
how she overcame the guilt of
using her light skin to gain where
dark—skinned blacks could not.

“One of the advantages to
having light skin is that you’re
invisible in some places,” said
Denicotte. “I wanted to make
something beautiful out "of some-
thing ugly. That’s why the book
took so long to write.”

Derricotte said she even used

her light skin to “trick” people into
thinking she is white. As a result of
this, Denicotte sometimes felt
guilty and out of place.

For example, when looking
for homes in Upper Montclair,
N .Y., Denicotte would go alone to
the realtors, leaving her dark-
skinned husband at home, kr1ow—
ing she would be shown nicer, bet-
ter—p1iced homes when she was
alone. ,

She looked at 80 homes on
her own, and drove with her hus-
band at night to see the homes,
explaining to him what each room
looked like on the inside.

“I got a rage in me and a

desire to have one of those hous— y

es,” said Denicotte.

When Denicotte and her hus-
band Bruce ﬁnally decided on a
home in an upper-class, all-white
neighborhood, Denicotte realized
that the segregation she saw while
searching for a house did not cease
when they moved in.

The residents of the neighbor-
hood excluded Derricotte and her
family from a country club they all
belonged to. In the archaic rules of
the club, blacks were not allowed
to join.

The book and her introspect
into the problems she has encoun-
tered with race have given her a
tool to reach out to others, and her
high position as a professor at the
University of Pittsburgh puts her
in the best position to get through
to students.

In a break between traveling
to neighboring states to'do read-'
ings, Denicotte gave a reading of
her new book to Pitt students on
Thursday.

THE PITT NEWS

nearly 50 stu-

diﬂerent colors,

Derricotte
paused, close to
tears, and held
her breath, and
said, “This part is really hard for
me.” Some studentslshed tears
with her, others just listened and
nodded.

Denicotte encouraged the stu-
dents to speak out during the read-
ing. She told of a story she includ-
ed in her book where she, as a
young girl, encountered a man on
a train whom she talked to for
most of the uip.

, That night, the young
Denicotte asked the man if he
could go back to his seat so she
could stretch her legs. The man
said “If you saw what’s sitting in
the seat beside me, you’ll know
why I can’t go bac ” She turned
around.

A black man sat behind them.

next morning, he apologetically
asked her to breakfast.

At this point in her talk with
the students, Denicotte looked up
from the white-covered book and
asked the students, “What would
you do?” p

Some students said they

would go, some said they would
walk away. Denicotte smiled at
every answer, holding the crowd
in suspense as to what she said to
the man. -
She read the remainder of the
story to the students. As it turned
out, she made the decision to walk
away. -

“I felt I had to punish him,”
said Denicotte. _ -

She highlighted‘ this as one of
the ﬁrst times she was encountered
with the decision whether to reveal

she thought ignoring the man was
the right thing to do. S

Later in the talk, Denicotte

Denicotte pointed out, were black

The woman said her stepfa-
ther is black and she has a vivid
childhood memory of’ sitting on
his lap and trying to rub his dark
color off onto her white skin. '

“Wow,” said Denicotte. “You
need to write about that.”

After hearing stories of stu-
dents’ ﬁrst encounters with racial
awareness, Denicotte talked with
the students about the racial bani-
ers thatare put up as a result of
learning.

 FROM PAGE 1
Jens Schriver, who operates the Evil House
of Cheat in Copenhagen, also contends his
site is not intended to give college students
free rides, but rather to improve the quality of
their work by comparing it to that of their
peers.
“I believe students who study others’
works make better essays. Example: Do you
think a director who has seen one movie
makes better movies than one who has seen
hundreds? I don’t. Inspiration makes a better
writer,” said Schriver.

In its third year of operation, Schriver
reported his site has over 8,200 papers online
and is visited about 3,000 times per day.
Most papers on his site, he said, are accom-
panied by a detailed description of the work
and the grade received. Schriver says critics
of his site are blaming the wrong person.

“If a student gets an essay at [House of

Cheat] and hands it in as his own, then who \

pays "or gains? He does. Should he do it? You
tell me. Maybe the problem doesn’t really lie
with him or [House of Cheat], but in the way
he looks on responsibility,” said Schriver. “I
think anyone who uses [House of Cheat] like
[that] is pulling himself down. On the other
hand, I think anyone using it for inspiration
is pulling himself up.” _

Schriver criticized professional tenn
paper mills that often advertise in Rolling
Stone, other magazines and web sites. i

“At six dollars per page, maybe you

THE PITT NEWS

should just save and get a fake diploma
instead,” he said.

David Brumble, Pitt’s associate dean of
the College of Arts and Sciences, laughed
when given Sahr and Schriver’s reasoning
behind creating their sites.

“Obviously that’s just a clever dodge or
actually, a not—so—clever dodge,” he said.

He went on to say Pitt’s academic
integrity policy will be reﬁned and sirrrpli—
ﬁed after several faculty members encour-
aged the policy’s review so students who are
caught plagiarizing are dealt with swiftly and
decisively.

Brumble said the policy on plagiarism
when he was in school was simple: the ﬁrst
time he or she was caught, the student was

failed; the second time, ‘he or she was

expelled

“That was simple,” he said. “It was the
policy, and everyone understood it and I
would like to move in that direction.”

Brumble estimated, though, the ﬁe-
quency of plagiarism at Pitt is “below the
national average because of how our profes-
sors teach writing and set up papers.”

He explained that professors assign very
speciﬁc topics and require various rewrites
before the ﬁnal product may be turned in.

Under that system, he said, “It’s going to
be very diﬂicult [to use a plagiarized term
paper]. I think it would be more diiﬁcult to
use the dishonest paper than to do your own
wo ”

Whatever the real motive behind the
creation of School Sucks and Evil House of

Cheat, both pages’ creators say the media

attention is good for business. Sahr even.

established a toll—free number for journalists
to callto interview hum. ' - "

Schriver was reluctant to release ﬁnan-
cial details and would not comment on his
total income from House of Cheat He did,
though, reportthat over 6,500 people have
paid the $10 subscription‘ fee for a year of
access to his site, equating to an income of
some $65,000, or about $22,000 per year,
not including advertising income.

In Sahr’s case, he said a venture capital
ﬁrm is planning on investing $5 million in
his site. ’

“That means that others believe in it,”
said Sahr. “It makes me [earn] about two‘ to
three times what your teachers make.”

“The days of mediocre teachers giving

administration are over.”

  Term paperson  

should be incenfivieill
for creative teaching

With website names like "School Sucks" and
"Evil House of Cheat," it's hard to believe their
owners who offer used term papers online when
they say they're not trying to aid plagiarism. Few
students may look to other term papers for their
research or ideas. After all, how would you even
footnote that in your own essay?

But the owners do make a good point when
they suggest that giving students easy access to
these papers should pressure teachers to be more
creative in developing assignments.

Professors can combat plagiarism by making
it extremely difficult to accomplish.

Punishment for plagiarism will only work if
the culprits are caught, and then it is after the fact,
when somebody has already cheated himself and
his classmates by submitting another's work as his
own. As always, prevention is better than a cure.

Professors should work hard every semester to
develop new assignments and invent new, cre-
ative topics on which students can write term

' papers . .

Even with the thousands of papers online, the
odds are still slim of finding a good paper on the
history of criticism of ancient Egyptian poetry as
evidenced in Shakespeare's "Antony and
Cleopatra."

Of course, not every term paper topic needs to
be so obscure, but the more creative and focused
an assignment is, the more difficult plagiarism
will be and the more students will learn from the
exercise.

We pay a lot of money to come to college.
Many of us are going to leave here with debts
written in five figures. Most of us are smart
enough to write our own papers and try to get our
money's worth out of this education. But even for
us, we'd come a lot closer to that goal if our
teachers spent time devising new assignments
rather than recycling the same ones from last
semester or 20 years ago.

‘Tuesday, 10 February 1998

 

Graduate students and post—doctoral fellows are
charged 'with delivering this continuous ﬂow of
information. That being so, graduate students
and post—doctoral fellows would be ill-advised
to make too major a commitment to a teach-
ing assignment. Graduate students and post-
fellows who , get the
"teaching/research" balance’ wrong will
likely be let go.

Graduate students and post—doctoral
fellows have a second potential deficit;
they have little experience in the. art of
teaching and, although hopefully well-
versed in the single area of their special-
ty, lack the diversity of knowledge that
allows them to make necessary cross-
connections between subjects.‘ ,

Since a college education must now
be the basis for a multi-career life, edu-
cational breadth at the undergraduate
level is more essential than ever. Such an ‘
education cannot be provided by on-the-
job trainees.

I encourage undergraduates to ‘monitor
closely what is afoot at Pitt these days. The
outcome concerns you intimately — now in
terms of the quality and variety of available .
courses, and later in terms of the perceived value
of the University of Pittsburgh undergraduate
degree. , T A

One change in current University of
Pittsburgh policy that would be appropriate to
introduce and advocate is the final separation of
the undergraduate education/general studies mis-
sion from the research/graduate program venture.
At present, the finances of these two missions are
co—mingled.

Undergraduates would be better served if
undergraduate tuition monies, the state under-
graduate tuition subsidy and alumni gifts to
undergraduate education were kept distinct, and
were used exclusively for activities directly relat-
ed to undergraduate education (for example,
salaries of faculty and’
staff who spend their
time teaching, advis-
ing and supporting the
undergraduate ven- ,
ture, partial support

undergraduate income should be "tagged" for
undergraduate purposes. .
Complementarily, external research support,
graduate training awards, graduate student fees,
alumni gifts marked for research and graduate
student training, and proceeds from royalty pay-
ments, patent" income and research seminar hono-

research/graduate student training mission (such
as new faculty research start-up funds, the, frac-
tion of annual salary of a faculty member that
corresponds to the fraction of time that faculty
member spends in pursuit of research and gradu-
ate student training, etc.).

cumstances, Pitt may even be able to reduce
undergraduate tuition costs. ,

Moak’s two
cents on the $52
million question

It’s my general philosophy that
if you’re going to spend $52 mil-
lion on something, you’d better be

sure you do it right. With all that
money being poured into Pitt’s new
convocation center, and with such
an imperfect building as Fitzgerald
Field House to learn from, there
aren’t too many excuses to mess
things up this time around.

With that in mind, I have a few
suggestions on how to make the
convocation center a huge improve-
ment over the field house:

1. An indoor track

With the possible exception of
Trees Field, the track inside the
field house is arguably the poorest
excuse for an athletics facility on
campus.

I know most of you have never
heard of Trees Field. It’s where
Pitt’s baseball team plays its home
games. If you’ve ever been there,
you understand why it’s so poorly
advertised.

The convocation center won’t
do much to change Trees Field, but
it can improve on the track. A
decent 200—meter, six-lane (that
means six lanes all the way around,
not six on the straightaways and
four around the turns like the cur-
rent one) track is not an unreason-
able request to make of a school
like Pitt. It could circle the basket-
ball court just like the track circles ,
the football field in Pitt Stadium.

There’s no reason why places
like Kent State should have .the
facilities to host an indoor track
meet while Pitt barely even has an
indoor track to‘ speak of.

2. A bigger student seating section
The convocation center is going
to have roughly twice as many seats
as the field house, so it’s logical to
assume that the student section for
basketball games will be twice as
big. It should be even bigger. ,
Pitt can’t even fill the field
house now (despite any announced
attendance figures). The only part
of the field house I’ve seen even
close to full this season is the stu-
dent section. If and when Pitt ever
re—emerges as even an average Big
East team, even morestudents will

For two years now, a

But Showalter went on
to be an All—American last
year, and this season, he
took the upper hand in the
series with a 4-3 win over
Loper at the Mat Town

later, as Ray McKenzie dished the
puck to Ryan Kilstem, who beat
Kenny to his left side on a two-on-one
breakaway.

George Washington’s physical
game also dominated the match. The
Colonials intimidated Pitt with a fierce
checking game, although Chouinard
didn’t want to pay credit to that aspect.

“I don’t think they had any out-
standing physical play,’’ he said.
“Neither did we, that’s why it was
wide-open skating like that — no
physical play. If you don’t ﬁnish your

checks, your man just skates away.”

The Panther power play was ane-
mic, as compared to the George
Washington man-advantage; the
Panthers were held scoreless in all
three attempts, while three of GW’s
ﬁve goals came on the dreaded second-
period power play.

“No character, no heart, no intensi-
ty  you can’t win hockey games with-
out that combination,” said Chouinard
after the game. “No talent, we can deal
with that. But when you don’t have any
heart, you don’t belong in the game.”
