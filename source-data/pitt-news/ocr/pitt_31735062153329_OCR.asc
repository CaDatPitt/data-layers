about the granting of the LL.TV de-

On last Wednesdlay, Professor Sil-

Following the exercises last ‘Thurs-

Kammer and Henry J. Koenig, anoth-

took part in the preparation of ‘the-

The. Pitif Panther’ was born No-
vember 25, 1=914,‘ﬁourished for. three
years, -strVuggled_ along for another,
went‘ into retiremenVt during the war.
-and» returned to resume a. vigorous’
existence on ’the_camp.us~ in Septem-
ber, 1919. Previous to this-year its
fortunes‘ have been in the hands of
live annual staffs.

V. The real daddy of the Panther
was George M,‘ P. Baird, ,’09, who has
been _respoQsi»b.1e for so much that is
valuable in student activities "before
‘and since his own graduation. Baird,

dormer ‘alumni secretary, and then

«a member of the English faculty in

the College until his retirement to
‘enter ‘warV_-work, decided in 1914 that

Pitt had gone along without the sup-

port of a. humorous pu‘bli-cat.-ion much

too lo-ng, so he called Vtgogether a
group,‘ including ‘i‘Sid" "-Hoehl‘, “Dick”

‘McDaniel, ‘George VKetc_hum, Louis
1Bro.ido, “Jim” Dudley, “Rod? Dar-
.ragh and a couple of others, who,
after many summer evening con-
claves in various State VI-Iall rooms,
met ﬁnally -one evening in the old
library and organized the-ﬁrst board
.with Hoehl as editor, and A.‘ B.
‘Di'vvens_ as business manager. After
a- long discussion as to the most
‘fitting name for the periodical, all.
suggestions were ‘ eliminated save
those" of Pitt Panther and the Piper,
and a tie‘ vorte resulting among the
eight present, the‘ writer, then as-_
sistant registrar, and ‘working over-
time as all registrars have done be-
fore. and since was called in to settle
the argument. It was thus by 3. mar.-
ginof one vote the Panther got his
name.  - -1

During the ﬁrst_ year, beginning as
we have said «in November, four is-
-sues were. published,’ and the cordial
reception given them resulted in: the
development -the next year of an
eight-issue paper-, the number which
has been maintained ever since! Fol-
‘lowing the regime of H-oehl and Div-
svens, most of the staff holding over
for the second year, Ipuis Broido,
-chief contributor during the ﬁrst
year of Pantlierfs life, was elected
editor, whi1e»his friend and fratern-
ity brother, “Eddie”. Lovitz, Econom-
ics,‘ "17, became business manager.
This ‘year was marked .by a very
healthy growth in all directions, and

inquiry as to the admission -of teach-

to the monster Alumni Carnival to be

held Friday evening before Com-
mencement‘ in Alumni Hall.. Special
notices were sent to every member of
the Alumni Association and to Sc-
niors, but it is declared by the Alum-
ni in charge of the affair that faculty
men, students below the digniﬁed
grade of Senior and alumni‘ not mem-
bers of the association are just as
welcome. ‘ V
“The purpose of the Alumni Car-
nival,” says Chairman Norman Mac-

shall‘ be thoroughly digniﬁed, sober

“It is for this reason that we_ have

uncovered woodenbleachers’ in right ﬁeld and the» aim of the Special
Committee wasito eliminate this condition, if possible‘, so that each
pegson would get at least‘ two"seats in the stands, «it. ,wa:s‘,felt that
this _was moreequitab-le than permitting one'p.erson{,jto3‘purchase‘ a

FROM A cnADUATE’s VIEWPOINT

. I

 

A story appears in the news columns of this paper in Whlch
R. T. McCormick,‘ ’88, is quoted- as Saying that the P1“ Weekly
“deserves the deepest and most favored consideration that the
Universitycan give it. . . . . . It is vital and r -cessary and should
be receiving ten or twenty times the support it is getting at present.
A communication from the secretary of the Advisory Board ‘of
Student Activities states that the Weekly is one of many activities
seeking increased appropriations and that as a result the question
of increasing the student activity fee will be bI'011gh’0 “P b9f(l1'e
the Board of Trustees. If the Board of Trustees should not in-
crease the activity fee, such action should not prevent an increased
.- appropriation to the VVeekly which has excelled other activities in
-. bringingabout the advancement of Pitt. ' L.
‘ Mr. "McCormick is right when he speaks of the connection of
E , thg Weekly and Pitt as follows: “The Pitt Weekly is that mouth
piece for Pitt. The University ought to aim to make the Weekly
a publication of po-wer——it is absolutely one of the vital, funda-
" . mental needs of the school.” _
 So, readers of the Weekly, if you believe as Mr. McCormick
does, do not remain silent, but express y0u1“Se1V€S and lelf the_ Ad‘
visory Board of Student Activities realize that you are d1SSat1Sﬁ€d
with the four-page Weekly and that you desire a bigger paper.
