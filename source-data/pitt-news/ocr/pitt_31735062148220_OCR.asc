Dewey Leads
Student Choice

For Presidency

McNutt Second, for ’-4:0
Garner Rates Third,

By JOE BELDEN, Editor-
Student Opinion Surveys of America

V AUSTIN, Texas, Nov. 10.-Thomas
E. Dewey, youthful New York district
attorney, islﬁrst choice for the United
:Sta’tes"‘présidency among the ‘nation’s
colle-gel, and university students, if
President Roosevelt does not run
again.

, Six months ago the Student Opinion
Surveys of America found in its ﬁrst
poll on presidential possibilities that
Paul V.'McNutt, Democrat, held the
lead with a‘ ‘popularity of 17.7 per
cent, only 2.1 per cent over Dewey.
Today the racket-busting Republican
has climbed ahead and has with him
over a third of those collegians who
declare they have made up their
minds on a candidate for 1940. Me-
Nutt has dropped to second place,
Vice-president John N. Garner fol-
lowing a close third.‘

The poll represents the opinions of
students without including President
Roosevelt as a possible candidate.
Staff interviews also asked a cross-
section of students including all age,
sex, geographical, and political groups,
“Would you like to see Roosevelt run
for a third term?”

Only 31.8 per cent said yes. But
since last January the President has
increased his third-term approval
among collegians from 28.2 per cent,
the continuing polls of the Student
Opinion Surveys show. The Surveys
are published weekly by student
newspapers_ the nation over, including
the Pitt , News which cooperate by
conducting local interviews that are
mailed‘ to the headquarters at the
University of Texas for tabulation.

To the question, “If Roosevelt is
not a candidate in 1940, whom would

Paper Features
‘Fireslide Chats’

Chancellor John ‘G. Bowman has,
opened a campaign to “sell” himself

to the students of the University,
through his “ﬁreside chats,” accord-
ing to a‘ article which appeared in
Wednesday’s Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.

The article appeared under the
byline of Harry Kodinsky, veteran
Post-Gazette reporter, who. is en-
rolled as a freshman in the humani-
ties curriculum of the College.

Describing the atmosphere of the
“ﬁreside chats,” which are attended
by groups of 10 students, the article
labels the meetings as “charm teas,”
intended to “offset the adverse pub-
licity he (the"-Chancellor) and the
University have been getting all over
the United States.” .3  A -

Mary Greeg,,C40, chief justice of
Senior Court, has, pointed out that
the “ﬁreside chat's”' are not .a, new
idea. The ﬁrst meetingwas held last
term, on January 5, at the~..request of
last year’s Senior Court, headed by
Edith Bart, ’39. '

“Fireside chats” with the Chan-
cellor have been held regularly on
Thursday afternoons throughout the
year. Because of the limitedsize of
the groups, students are invited to the
meetings by Senior Court. Any Uni-
versity student may apply for an in-
vitation through members of Senior
Court, or the offices of the dean of
men-and dean of women.

Coeds Entertain
At Sunday Teas

Fraternity women of the University
will entertain February freshmen and
transfers, and upperclass women at
rushing teas this Sunady.

The teas will be held from 3 to 5
o’clock at the individual fraternity
houses. ..According to .. Panhellenic

tend only one tea during the after-
noon. . ,

Mary Letsche, C4.0, chairman of
the rushing rules committee of Pan-
hellenic Council, states that the list
of eligible girls this fall is unusually
larage. Invitations have been sent
to 75 rushees.

During silence week, which starts
‘Monday, fraternity women and rush-
ees must not talk with one another.
The purpose of this rule is to give
both groups of women a better chance
to make their decisions independ-
ently.

» Fraternities will hand in their bid
lists to the office of the dean of wo-
men before 9:30 o’clock Tuesday
morning. Wednesdaymorning, those
girls -whose names. appeared on bid
‘lists will receive preferential ballots
through the mail.

These ballots must be returned to
the office of the dean of women by
Friday morning. At 5 o’clock that
afternoon, fraternities will get their
acceptance lists and formal bids will
be mailed to the new pledges,

. Miss Letsche announces that those‘
fraternities which are not giving teas
are allowed to invite girls to- mem-
bership. --

Grid Break-off

‘Not Surprising’

University authorities yesterday

«were apparently undisturbed over

the story in a downtown ‘newspaper
announcing the break-off of football
relations between Duquesne and the
University of Pittsburgh. ‘

A deﬁnite announcement of the
break cameafter Aldo Donelli, Du-
quesne director of athletics; James
Hagan, University director of ath-
letics; and Charles Bowser, Uni-
versity head football coach, held a
luncheon meeting at the University
club on Wednesday and discussed the
situation. ' .

On the University campus it has
been taken for granted for some time
that Duquesne would not be includ-

Donelli has, at least once, attempted
to continue the series in 1940.

Hagan’s explanation for the Uni-
versity’s not having previously made
the announcement was that, “The
University releases its schedule for
the year, not as each game is sched-
uled. When the 1940 schedule is re-
leased, there will be no question as
to which schools Pitt will play.’’

There will be no official holiday on

During the activities hour Monday
a new tradition will be inaugurated.
There will be a ceremony for the an-
nual Goal Post Trophy, which will be
awarded to the winner of the annual
classic. “ .

,If Pitt wins the game tomorrow,
present plans call for a parade ‘of the
student body, Pitt-Band, and team,
led by Pat Cusick, E40, president of

negie Tech campus.

If Pitt should lose, a special cere-

, mony will be held with Carnegie Tech

representatives.
There is a sign on the goal posts

, now planted on the Carnegie campus

stating that the posts are the annual
award of the winning school. The
1938 score is painted on the sign, and
there is room for this year’s result.

The goal posts will be turned over
to the representatives of the winning
school during the ceremony, and the

school for one year. ' ' '

The agreement reached between
student representatives of the Uni-

A Moment of Silence
Is N of Quite Complete
L Twenty—onc years ago all the Big Men. in Europe
gatherecl around a couferenceptable in France and
"stopped the \Vo1'-ld War. , -
VVhen the meeting was over, some of them were
in a very. good humor, some of them in,._not such a
good humor, but they shook hands all around any-

way, and g‘enera].1y agreed that the Wa.r to End-
VVars hadn’t been such a bad idea: Man was ,a_

rather iiltclligeut animal to think of a war to end
wars. '

Then they all set out for home to pick up the’

pieces—-and get ready for another war.

As a. climax to that meeting, -the leaders of
each country set aside, a day on which each year
everyone could stop for a moment in the..mad rush
of civilized life to remember that the ﬁnal Wa~r to
End VVa.rs was over, and, incidentally, to rem.em-
ber the soldiers, killed and wounded, who, fools
that they were, had believed in all the things these
men said. L '

They called it Armistice Da.y.

Tomorrow at eleven o’clock there will be a mo-
-ment of sile-nce——except for the sound of guns—in
many civilized nations while the people pause to
think of a war that made the world safe——for an-
other War.

An Open Letter
To Harry Kodinsky

Dear Harry: _

,VVe noticed that you had a front page story
about the Chancellor ’s ﬁreside chats printed in one
of the (lowutown newspapers the other day. In one

sense, V‘v'C.\'\7§‘lﬁ€ glad to ‘see that because we are al-

ways glad when -.1. University student, particularly

‘a frcs'hma.n, makes his inark in the World.

Possibly because you are a freshman, you had

-a few of the facts wrong. And because we don’t

want any fl‘9S.hl’ll‘&lll to go ‘through four years mak-
ing l'lll,S‘[il_l{(»‘VS, we thought we’d point out some

’.errors." -’» - I A
First, there is the "matter of who started the’
_’,fi,l~e_si_c_lc cllats and when they were started.‘ You

gave the impression that the idea originated re-

cently with Dr. Bowman- Actually; the chatswerev
‘ ﬁrst held last year on the suggestion of Senior

Court and c_onth1ued this year under the sponsor-
shipgof the same group. '  ‘

You could have found that out from any up-

Lperclassman. The New York Times last January
‘devoted almost a whole column to an explanation
of the ﬁreside chats.

A release on the same sub-
ject from the University News Service was given
to all of the Pittsburgh newspapers last spring,

' but none of them seemed to think the cha_tsworthy
I of comment. ' L

Then, too, you speak of the chats as “charm
teas,” which, you claim, is the name given them
by “skeptical Pitt students.” “Charm teas” is a
new one on us.
‘ ‘ skeptical Pitt. students.’ ’

That’s about all we can say this time.‘ If there ’s
anything we can over do for you, such as giving
vou background information on campus affairs,
wc’ll be glad to help. You can ﬁnd’ us‘ in the of-
ﬁcxe any Monday, Wednesday, or Friday. ,

And Harry, remember, the ﬁreside chats ’aren’t

Dance After the Game

Kenny (Red Dog) Krunkleton has developed a
sudden interest in McKeesport real estate. Is it that
he likes the town or is it the real estate agent, June
Seiberg? He claims that she has everything._ You
do mean in the way of property, don’t you Kenny . . .

Assistant track manager Jim Baldwin claims that
he set a newswimming record at Conneaut Lake this
summer. The kid’s darn good. If you don’t believe
us, ask him to show you his clipping . . .

Midge Frobuck and Nancy Sundstrom deserted the
local talent and had dates with Temple boys at the
game in Philadelphia lastweek . .

Reinforced by that beefsteak, to take up where we
left off, we rode back again and whistled Pablo out of
his hiding place in the brush. “My friend,” we said,
giving him the stern parental eye, “We cannot allow
you to go around airing your semi-sophistry, in which
there is enough truth to make it dangerous. Sit down
while we match wits with thee.” Pablo squatted on
his heels and squinted reﬂectively down his riﬂe at a
rattlesnake just across the Rio Grande.

‘The Inner Light’ .

“Pablo,” we said, waving our hand airily—“Pablo,”
"we said again, disentangling our hand from a cactus
clump, “You have spoken of the beauty of women, and
Pablo, my ugly little one, you spoke of physical beauty
alone. Observe, my friend, that there is yet another
aspect of beauty. "We will not preach of the inner light,
nor of the lovely spirit, but of other things. , Thus, back

“Si, si, senor, I understand,” said Pablo excitedly,

Oxford Exchange C

By Edgar Beigal

Friendly restraint—-and a slowly
evolved mutual understanding of
Anglo-American problems and sym-
pathies—marked the Pitt-Oxford de-
bate held Wednesday evening before

a capacity Stephen Foster memorial
audience of 600.

Second in a series of international
debates between Oxford university
and the University. of Pittsburgh
during the past ﬁve years, this occa-
sion featured a split team debate on
the possibilities and probabilities of
the question “Should the United
States "declare war on Germany?’
Fitzgerald Begins

As chairman Tom Abdo, C40, ex-
plained, the quartet ‘ of word-
mongers “aired the facts, and not
their personal prejudices; presenting
a cold-hearted analysis of this del-
icate question.” Following a short
musical program by the Collegian
quartet, Rufus H. Fitzgerald, provost
of the University, in an introductory
lwelcome, oriented the audience to
the “educational institution” at Ox-
ford.

At 8:34 .o’clock, 19 minutes after
WWSW put the program on the air,
Peter Street, in an admittedly ‘ﬂip-
pant” view, quoted Walter Lippman
and Franklin Roosevelt to prove that,
whatever be the affirmative’s argu-
ment, the United States will not go
to war against Germamny, and that
Pittsburgh students will not .have
“bayonets instead of books” next
year. He expressed the conviction
that another AEF is unnecessary;
but that the United States should do
all it can to “save the world for dem-
ocratic culture.”

Larson on Isolation.

The second affirmative

speaker,

“My convictions,” he said, “point to
the fact that the United States has
a vital stake in Europe; that an Al-
lied defeat would encourage the
fascist. campaign in the United
States; that German trade encroach-
ment in South America would
spread; that only a removal of
stringent trade barriers—and more
important: a just peace after the
war—wil1 stop the decay into which
war is leading the world. Only if
the United States enters the war, and
makes it a short-order, shall we have
a just peace.” » _ ~ a _

Abe Wolovitz, C40, and Teddy
Heflth, Dlfesideflt of the Oxford Union
society, opposed the motion. W010-
vitz branded Anglophobes as “the
lunatic fringes” and instead blamed
the world crisis on “mistakes” of the
three large democracies in failing to
provide for a workable plan of col-
lective security.
of the United States does not con-
Cern Europe,” he said. “Our atten-
tion‘ should be placed on the Far
East, and in South America. Any-
way, England can win the war with
her own blockade.”

Ernest Larson, C40, emphasizedthe .
illusion of the “isolation principle.” ’

Pitt’s victory—ﬂushed little Panth-‘

The Blue-and-Gold cubs not only
handed the Plaid frosh a 47-0 shel-

bumps and bruises.

This week Pitt’s frosh _gridders are
preparing for the encounter with
Kiski Prep at Saltsburg, Pa., on No-
vember 17. Kiski boys haven’t been
up to par this year, for while their
defense is fair, they have not shown
anything resembling a potent attack.
They beat a woefully weak Tech
team by only a 16-0 score.

Pitt’s ﬁrst team clicked as a unit
for the ﬁrst time this year last Fri-
day night and showed considerable
offensive strength. The reserves, how-
ever, still didn’t function as well as
they should have. it the, first club

Whiteman Urges Seniors“

To Get Pictures for Owl

Am
V

Students Must Take
Photographs at Gimbel’s
Before November 18

Many of the seniors who have
subscribed to the 1940 Owl have
not as yet had their pictures taken
at the Photo-Reﬂex studio, accord-
ing to -Sa.m-Whiteiiian, BA40, busi-
ness manager’ of the yearbook.

November‘ 18 has been set as the
deadline for pictures of seniors for
the book, and the students who have
not had their pictures taken are to re-
port immediately to the official Owl
photographers located on the fourth
floor of Gimbel’s department store; ' ‘

Pictures should beptaken as soon as
possible so that retakes may be made
if they are I necessary, Whiteman

Informality is the theme of -the Owl
pictures this‘year,*‘Dick Weiss, C40,
editor, states. All senior pictures are
taken in informal street clothes; not
in the tuxedo or drapes that were
used previously.

“Men should wear white shirts
when having their pictures taken, and
women should wear clothes that will
photograph well,” Weiss says.

There are over 80 senior Owl sales-
men on campus from whom subscrip-
tions may be purchased. A deposit
of $3 is required on the book. Owls
may also be purchased in the Owl of-
ﬁce, 801 Cathedral. '

Leighton Describes. A
Meteorite Exhibition

The specimens, about 35 in number,
have been gathered by the University

only a few hundred meteorites have

seven of these in Pennsylvania, the
display is a valuable one, according to

5 Mr. Leighton.

. Students and others interested are
invited to examine the exhibition. ‘

bers as a novelty, but they were re-
ceived iso enthusiastically that they
have become a regular feature.

that at 1many of their fraternity par-
ties thejsquare dance has become pop-
ular. It’s a sure way to break the
ice.”   , . _ .

doubled in size, newcomeers still have
an opportunity to enter.
