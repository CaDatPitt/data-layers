in ‘my’ life.’_‘ I, however,‘ was ‘six feet

could "runV.~a" hundred "yards in ' about

out "they-_<sa.id:> ‘V‘You are the one ‘we
want.” They tool: me out, put _a football
suit on me andput me "at -left half back.

At that time the __University was scat-
tered, a. part being’ on the bin in A11’e-_
gheny, ‘the Amedical "College being down"
in the Cityof Pittsburgh} andthe con-

sequence was that we never gottogether

‘for real’ practice, but that seemed‘ to

lay there on the ground, h_ed.0u'bled up‘
‘his fist and said, “You b1a‘.nkety,b1ank-

iememberedby ‘the alumni of Pitt.
During the" year interest alumni

able rate and the grads» h-ave been
evincing so much enthusiasm on all
sides that ‘ it is believed "ifn-ore will
want to come back -to the campus
for the ‘ﬁnal exercises of the year
andnote some of the steps that have
been taken to "put ‘Pitt on the map
and hear of some of.the plans for
the future. " . V "

The ,Secretary in‘ his visits to the
alumni has been deeply impressed
by the ‘spirit which Pitt gradshave
for the Vschool—"-how they are con-
tinually talking ‘of -it, boosting" it Vto
the high school students, seeing that
it gets proper publicity in the local
papers, etc. "Theirspirit Wi_ll be all
the stronger. if we can get them in
the habit of paying avisit-at least
once a year to the campus "'and not-
ing for themselves just what -is being
done. Football has -beeijiethe best
means of _gettAing.the alumni here in
the past ,"and we want -the Com;
mencement" season to have “the
same magnetiopowers. '

Commencement day ‘_will be
“Alumni Day,” too, and this will :be
the day thevgrads are urged to‘ “come
back.” ' The usual head"quart_ers_ will
be ‘provided on the camIpus§“""with stu-
dent guides in charge of the Alumni

Preparations for ‘ War Make
It.Necessary to Cancel En-
gagement. ' ' I '

At the last meeting of the commit-
tee in charge of the Raymond Robins
Campaign, it was announced that on
account of his promise of service to
the government in the event of war,
Mr.» R0-bins has been compelled to
concel his arrangements with the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh.

The word =came as a keen disap-
pointment to the University and to
the Association as well as to all those
who are interested in the religious life
of the University. It was understood
that the University of Pittsburgh shall
have first claim on Mr. Robins at t-he
return of normal conditions, should
he decide to continue his evangelistic
work among colleges.

It seems to be -the’ concensus of‘

opinion that the energy generated in
the preparation 0-f plans for the Rob-
ins campaign should be conserved and
applied‘ to the religious life of the
school through the normal channels of
Association work.

Mr. Framcis Miller of the Interna-
tional Committee of the Y. M. 'C. A.
conferred with the so-called general
committée last night at its meeting at
the Belleﬁeld Pjresbyterian Churchlx
He gave an inspirational address ‘and
made some very practical suggestions
along the line of an intensive ‘devo-
tional program. He made it é‘lear_that
a greater responsibility is re'st\1ng on
Christians today in our colleges than

ever »befor,e, and ‘brought home to each‘.
