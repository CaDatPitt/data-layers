William Swartzbaugh. The governmental group held a special meet-
ing last Thursday evening to discuss formation of an appellate which
‘would’ deal with non-academic problems.

Anniversary Production
Closes Players’ Season

The Pitt Players will celebrate the 20th anniversary of
the ﬁrst off-Broadway production of Thornton Wilder’s “Our
Town" tonight, tomorrow, and Wednesday. The Players, in
May, 1939, became the first‘ amateur group in the nation to

perform the play.

The curtain goes up at,8:30 p.m. in Stephen Foster Me-

morial each night of this, the ﬁnal¢

production of the _current aca-
demic year.

This evening’s debut has been
designated as High School Night.
Area schools were invited to at-
tend the performance at a special
reduced rate.

Tomorow’s performance is in
conjunction with Campus Ac-
tivities Night. This performance
is being sponsored through the
combined efforts of SGA and
Pitt Players to encourage co-
operation and better relation-
ships among campus organiza-
tions.

After the performance, SGA is
holding a reception in the Social
Room for members of the various
organizations attending.

Wednesday’s performance has
been designated as Alumni Night.
On hand to help observe the an-
niversary will be members of the
“Our Town” cast of the 1939 and

V 1952 productions.

Attending will be Mr. Buell
Whitehill, Pitt Player’s director
in 1939; Cyril VVecht. who play-
ed ’ the stage manager in the
1952 production. Michael Mc-
Hale, current director of the
Playersywas in the cast of the
1939 production. -

Mr. McHale termed “Our
Town” the most completely Amer-
ican play. “The present produc-
tion has greater depth than the
1939 one,” he commented. “The
play gets better like good wine.”

Jay Dantry plays the part of
the stage manager. Dr. and Mrs.
Gibbs are portrayed by Al Stew-
art and Georgia Adams. Steve
Gordon and Shirley Roth play

“The first thing to consider iswhat is desired
from a judicial system,” said SGA Judiciary Chair-
man Bob Fulton at the special meeting called
Thursday evening to discuss the set-up of a new
judiciary program.

Fulton enumerated three types of court systems

commonly found in other schools. These are: all
student groups, student groups with faculty ad-
visors, and joint student-faculty groups.
’ Fulton also opened the question as to whether
the new court should “start out small, with limited
jurisdiction, or take over a large area at the be-
ginning.” Possible areas of jurisdiction would be,
such things as campus traffic violations, dorm
rules, regulations of groups participating, in Uni-
versity functions, etc. '

Dr. William Swartzbaugh, as Dean of Students,
emphasized that the student body should “concern
itself with maintaining and raising the standards of

Fulton Reports to SGA Discussion Croup

Judiciary System Considered  

the University community." That is, any ‘court
should be more concerned with “crime preven-
tion” and rehabilitation than purely disciplinary
action.

The conclusions ﬁnally reached in the discus-
sion were that the system should deal mainly
with non-academic problems, that is, not withcases
of cheating, etc.

Secondly, that the SGA court would be an
appellate court much like the Supreme Court of
the U. S., with the inferior courts being AWS and
Men's Council, with the men’s and women's dorm
councils and Greek courts below them.

Also discussed was the method by which mem-

bers of the SGA court would be chosen. The con-

sensus seemed to be -that some system of appoint-
mentwas better than an elected judiciary. People
should be chosen who are “themselves respectful

“I’d like to see every student come back from vacation
ready to do his part toward promoting school spirit,” says
Paul Knouse, head cheerleader for next year,

_  five new cheerleaders and three returning, “let-
terinen,” Knouse has ambitious plans for next ‘year. The
cheerleaders have been practicing once or twice a week

already, and have been worki-ngO
on,‘-new cheers, though they_p1an'

not to do away with some of the
old traditional ones,‘ like “Alle-
gh__enee.” '

' iKnouse stresses that students

 “should know the names of cheers,

arid-Tespecially the words of the
chfeers themselves, so they" can
 effectively even if they can’t
hear the cheerleaders.
,  '4 -Support Athletes
g;I_{;nouse would also like to see
"more support of individual ath-
letes and of the team as a whole.
-This‘. degrading 6f men who do a
good job on" the ﬁeld doesn’t help
anybody.” He feels that the
school year is inﬂuenced by how
well "the team does; if they’re win-
ning everyone does a better job.
‘Next on Knouseis program is
"more co-operation between ‘the
band, Block P, and the cheer-
‘leajders. The dissension among
these groups. in the past has, he

\ feels. served to lessen spirit. I-Ie

 would like to see “co-ordination
in the programs 01’ these groups.”

The cheerleaders plan to be
participating in freshman camp,
orientation week programs and
band camp. They hope to be able
to promote spirit through these
programs. ’ - '

 ' "Improve Rallies

Also on next ., year’s agenda are
improved pep rallies and perhaps
a “CARavan” before the first

. stadium.

game; which is at Marquette on

Sept. 19. Another idea is to form
a “snake” or “tunnel” of students
for the team to enter through be
fore each game. —
Knouse would also like to in-
augurate several different meth-

ods for the Panther to enter the

engineers do with St. Patrick

every year,” Knouse explained.
He feels it is necessary “that
students have more pride in their
school, and maintain more "school
spirit. Then our record both aca-
demically and,on the ﬁeld will
improve and the athleteswill not
feel’ neglected by the student
body.” '

that there would be summer

' Exit of a Novel

By Devid,Breo»|xs‘|'one
A couple of years ago, on a softly glowing
spring evening a young man was sauntermg down

Beechwood Blvd. near the spot where it takes a

big bend into Fifth "Ave. He was darkly dressed,

navy jersey and black cotton pants, and even from ‘

a distance you were struckby his mop of black
hair and h-is moustache, .whichA 

pearance. _
His hands were thrust deep in
his pockets, as with head tilted

he whistlecl a low-pitched tune
that sounded faintly Spanish.
Within several minutes he had
reached the bend, stopped, look-
ed back over his shoulder, then

vanished with a bounce in his gait, seemingly into’

the tall oaks which line the street.

.If from that time on you had kept a close
watch on ‘Peter Beagle, you would have discovered
that he likes to walk and either whistle or sing
to himself. He prefers big, wide streets, but being
innately curious he has also-explored most ever)’
crooked path in the eastern part of Pittsburgh. _

GENERALLY HE LIKES to walk alone, setting -

his own pace, saying whatever hephas to say to a
singularly interested audience—himself.. Spring is
undoubtedly the best time for his journeys in the
old, beat-up pair of brown oxfords, but in pursuit
of pleasure, Peter will challenge a fall rain or a
winter snow squall while he meanders.

Through the "elementary laws of gravity, Peter
is a writer. In a rare, self-eﬁacing moment he has
admitted, with a little terror in his voice, “After
all, _what else is there for me to. do in this place
but write?” And that is what he’ continually does.

POEMS, sronms, SNATCHES of song have
spun from his typewriter for almost half of his 20
years, He wasted the first ten years of his life read-
ing, thinking about what to write and attempting

‘ to play professional baseball for the New York

Yankees.

His explanation for his failure to catch on with
the Yankees is that they were afraid of signing a
boy from the Bronx: “Hometown nerves and that
sort of thing.” Peter spent a bemused, at time un-
comfortable, four years at Bronx Science High
where he was a‘ rare avis in a,schoo1 where that
type_is not exceptional.

It is fair to state that he didn’t,—and doesn’t “dig”
science; not because. he can’t understand valences
and brachiopods, but rather, he dislikes system-

\ atized knowledge and enjoys conjuring‘ up ideas

in preference to cramming someone else’s into his
spacious mind. . A .
HE WROTE FOR the school literary magazine,
and won the Scholastic Magazines Writers’ Con-
test, which catapulted him at 16 into Pittsburgh,

. writing.

  

scholarship in hand. He struggled through the first
year, which he hardly ever speaks about. Hovvev;_er,
he frequently praises the freshman English in-
structor who dared to give him a "B” in them

A story about a telephone won the-— “Seven-
teen” magazine story contest while he was a soph-
omore. (That was the year he wore an olive shirt
and black tie, looking suspiciously like Steinbeck.)
Last year, a tale about a broken-hearted girl and
a poem about a Greek goddess won two “Atlantic”
prizes. '

. Now, in h_is last term at the University, Peter
has written his best poem, a ‘fable about an ob-
session,’ and he is banging away on his first novel.
Unlike the hundreds of autobiographical’ ﬁfrst
novels.written and rejected each year, Peter’s book
hasn’t a single young man or woman going through
adolescent trauma. _ A 

INSTEAD rr TALKS about uncomplicated.
ple who in a few unwary moments ﬁnd that com-_
plications can crop up fast as hell. Carefully con-
structed and paced,‘ the first six chapters were
surveyed by Viking Press which then"'picked ‘u
an option for the completed -novel. -

Within l8 months, the University's publicity
crew will have “another” Pitt genius” to crow
about. Beagle will be pleased to see his book in
print, but a triﬂe disconcerted with the fanfare.

Personality‘    

-“Admiring crowds and expensive homes make’

me nervous,” he cornmented after a small, but un-
comfortable, party-

Reading Peter’s manuscripts is a scary business.
You can go through ten pages of absorbing prose
before hitting the first erasure or scratch-ou_t._It
seems that he has the upcoming printed page in-
tact and ﬂashed upon the backs of his retinas‘ be-
fore he cranks a fresh sheet into the typewriter.

TWENTY-EIGHT LINES later the pre-planned
and completely digested product is out upon the
page for his inspection. This ability to yisualize be-
forehand what will ultimately be written is aresult
of diligent concentration and a memory for every-
thing’ imaginable. ‘

The novel, such as it is in progress, reflects the
depth of Beagle’s reading and his powers of ob-

servation. In truth, there are few things he hasn’t —

read,‘ and _he can talk intelligently about most that
he has. He is a canny judge of people and can
size upanyone (pretty, young girls excepted) with

a conversation or two. The completed novel will’

be, in many ways, the work of a skillful author.
On June 10 Peter Beagle will gratefully grab his
‘diploma, so ending his association with "Pittsburgh,
perhaps permanently.‘ With diploma, guitar, and
typewriter he will return to the Bronx to continue
writing. To borrow Bob Verd'erber’s phrase, “that
little kid with a moustache” has done some ﬁne
things in his stay here; ’

Chaplain Says Thanks
And ‘God Bless You’

Editor, The Pitt News:

Because I won't be “released”
until June 15, or later, I will be
deprived of the opportunity to
thank personally the incredible
number of students, faculty, ad-
ministration and employees of
beloved Pitt, whohave sent me
greetings and good wishes.

Although my gratitude can’t be
put into words, and I’ll have to
ﬁnd ways of expressing it in
wiser, worthier and more gener-
ous living wherever I'ﬁnd my-
self, it will mean much to me
if space can ‘be ‘found for this
in one of the issues of the Pitt
News. ' ' -

My seven years here have giv-

en me friends whom I "will "for-

«ever cherish. Again and again
my faith in God and in better
possibilities "of life has been
clariﬁed and" conﬁrmed by these
friends. ' - ‘

God bless everyone of you.

TILL WE MEET ‘AGAIN

This is the last column of my ﬁfth year of writing for Philip
Morris and Marlboro. ’I have made it a custom in the last
column of each year not to be funny. I know I have also
realized this aim in many other columns during the year, but

. that was not for lack of. trying. Today I am not trying. I am not

trying for two reasons: First, because you are getting ready for
final exams and in your present. state of shock, nothing in the
world could possibly make you laugh. And second, this ﬁnal
column of the year is for many of us a leave-taking, and good-
byes -.llwa._y.-‘ make me too misty to be funny.

For-me the year ends neither with a bang norh whimper, but
with a glow-a warm, pleasa.nt, mellow glow-—the kind of glow
ylou willﬁnd, for example, at the end of a Philip Morris or
Marlboro. A

It has been in every way a gratifying experience, my ﬁve I

years with the 1na,_kers of Philip Morris and Marlboro, ‘and I
would like to take this opportunity to extend my heartfelt
appreciation to these good tobacconists,‘ to assure them that
the memory of their kindness will remain ever green in my
hea.rt,.a.nd to remind them that they still owe me for the last
three columns. .

And in these waning days of the school year, let me address
myself seriously to you, my readers. Have I trod on any toes
this year? Ruffled any feelillgs? Jostled any sensibilities? If
so, I am sorry. ,

Have I occasioned ally lauglls? Chuckles? Sniggers? Mona.
Lisa smiles? If so, I’m glad.

- Have I persuaded any of you to try Philip Morris and
Marlboro? To taste that ﬁne ﬂavor? To smoke that eiicellellt
tobacco? If so, you are glad. ‘

And now the long, lazy summer lies ahead. But. for me sum-
mer is never lazy. It is, in fact, the busiest time of year. Two
summers ago, -for instmlce, I was out ringing doorbells every
single day, morning, noon, and night-. There. was a con.t7cst.,
you see, and the kid in my neighborhood who sold the most

bllling won a pony. I am proud to report that I was the lucky .

will ner. V

Last sunlnler I was also out ringing doorbells every single

day, morning, noon, and night. I was trying to sell the pony.

 

‘ This "summer I am not going to be out ringing doorbells.
I am going to saddle the pony and ride to Hollywood, California.
What am I going to do in Hollywood, California? I am going to
write a series of half-hour television comedies called THE

' MANY LOVES OF DOBIE GILLIS, and starting in October,

1959, your friends and mine,the makers of Philip Morris and
Mgrlboro, are going to bring you this program over the Colum-
bia Broadcasting System every Tuesday night at 8:30. Why
don’t you speak to your housemotllerand ask her if she’ll let
you stay up to see it? ' ~
And now good-bye. For me it’s been kicks all the way, and-I
hope for you it llas_n’t- been altogether unbearable. Have a good
summer. St:l.y well. Stay cool. Stay loose.

   Committee to Choose

   NCAA Teams Today

Panthers in Strong Contention°

 

 

After. Druhhing Juniata, 13-4

. a By TED ooL'ro1~; —
Bobbys Lewis’ Panthers are anxiously awaiting a bid to
the NCAA tournament at Omaha, Neb. The Panthers’ 13-4
victory over J uniata Saturday, coupled with Penn Stat-e’s 13-
9 loss to Temple on Friday, have put the Jungle Cats in a good

position to be selected.

The four-man selection committee for District ‘II is meet-

ing today in Scranton to decideO

which four teams to put in the
playoffs. Navy and Temple seem
assuredof spots while the Panth-
ers, St.
State and Villanova remain in the
running for the other two places.
The Panthers, who now are 13-
3, conclude their regular season
tomorrow against Duquesne at
Moore Field in Brookline. The
Dukes were clobbered about ten
days ago by the Cats, 14-0.
Herm Joy led the Panthers’

‘ , 22-hit assault at Juniata as they

, pounded out 13 runs. Joy went
' four-for-ﬁve, driving‘ in four
runs and scoring two.-

Bob Conti started for the Pan-
thers but -lasted only one inning
as he came down with a sore arm.
Dick ‘_Wirth took over and won
his fourth game of the year. Wirth

’ has yet to lose.

Conti gave up one run and two
hits in the first inning. Three con-
secutive‘ inﬁe1d'hits in the fourth
by Nick Kartsonas, George Scho-
eppner and Jerry Matulevic load-
.ed the bases for Bill Kaliden who
lined a single past third to give
the Panthers the lead.

, The Panthers then scored
three runs in the sixth, seventh
and ninth, and one in the eigthh.
.1 Kartsonas, Schoeppner and Ma-

'- _'tulevic each collected three hits.

‘ After the "contest the Panthers
were speculating on their chances
to get the bid to the NCAA tour-
nament. “I can’t see how they can
pass" us up,” Lewis stated. “With

our record, I think we deserve to _

go.”

In M‘iH History

By MfJR.RAY cnA_ss

 

Nine weeks ago; Bobby Lewis, Panther baseball coach, said to
us, "We think we have the club to take us all the way to the play-
offs.” We listened, but didn’t take Bob too seriously because baseball

Icoaches, unliketheir football counterparts, are notorious for their

pre-‘season optimism. .
It’s now 16 games and 13 wins later and we must bow to the

‘prognostication of Mr. Lewis. Actually, his prediction hasn't come

completely true. The NCAA District II selection committee is meet-.
ing today in Scranton, Pa., to decide which teams to place in the
"playoffs. .
' ‘But to this pre-season skeptic, the Pitt sluggers and glovers have
proved themselvesan outstanding baseball team. Even if the com-
riiittee doesn’t see fit to choose the Panthers for the post—season
téiurnament, we will still‘ have the same feeling.
3 . The pre_s_ent'Pant-hers will undoubtedly ﬁnish the season with
:‘:::the best team in Pitt baseball history. One year the Cats had an
 8'-3—record,.but these boys should top that percentage. The record-
I breaking year will have been, when it’s over tomorrow’ or some-
‘time during or at the end of the NCAA playoffs, studded with
thrills.  _

A pair of consecutive one—hitters by Bill Hamilton, a 14-run out-
burst against a usually strong Duquesneteam,’ a split that was only
a split because Ham’s right arm stiffened on him with always power-
ful Penn State, a nine-game winning streak. _ 0

I We asked skipper Bob whom he might single out as the most
valuable player on the squad and who might have been disappoint-
ments to him this "year. He gave the answer we expected.

“It’s hard to pick a guy. who is the most valuable. It’s usually
been a different man each game who has come through. And‘ there
haven’t been anydisappointments; in spots the-boys have done
real well.” ‘

_ With a little prodding, Bobby did mention a few individuals.
George Schoeppner who has played three different positions in
as many years; ’H4a‘_'rnilt-on who has pitched well for three years:
 DeLost who has started every game behind" the plate for
three years.

Then there are afew surprises. Dick Wirth who had a sore arm
last year and who is now 4-0; Jerry Matulevic who has played very

‘well at third; Ron Maser who beat Penn ‘State with a single.

Lewis related a story about First Baseman Maser. “Knowing that
I had used the whole pitching staff in the Penn State double-header,
Lefty came to me-the next day and said, ‘If you need me, I’ll pitch
against Juniata Saturday. I may not throw a ball the rest of the
summer, but I’ll pitch.’ ”

If the committee picks Pitt today, the Cats would have to play

, the toughest teams in the East, such .as St. John’s and Temple. “We

can stand up against any of the Eastern teams,” Lewis warned.

Lewis will__lose a few of this year’s top stars next season, but
he willhave a good number of them back plus some good freshmen
andplayers who were ineligible this season. Bob’s ﬁnal comment
was, “The boys played real exciting ball this year.” _

To the pleasure of local fans, this may hold true for many years
to come.

The office of Cultural and Educational Exchange is spon-

‘ soring a reception for foreign students at 4 p.m. tomorrow in
' thesocial room of Stephen Foster’. All students and faculty
‘areinvited to attend. \ A ~

§

Several students will give short talks, after which there
will ‘be an informal reception‘ and—~ entertainment by the

Men’s Glee Club.
The _purpose 6f the reception is

.to give recognition to foreign

students, faculty, and research
fellows, and especially to honor
those who are leaving.

‘There have been. at the Uni-
versity this year, approximate-
ly 155-160 undergraduate stu-
dents from _51 countries, proba-
bly“ 255 including visiting - fac-
ulty, research students and vis-
itors.

These students have often found

it difficult to become integrated

S‘ into the student body here, and it
is ‘hoped’ that the planned recep-

'tion and other programs can -help
to establish “lines of communica-
tion “between American and vis-
iting s-tudents.

The only counseling service for

’ foreign students presently is un-

der the office of Cultural and Ex-
change directed by ReneLichten-
stein. Sheis also the official liason
between__the govermnent immigra-

'on office and the students, hand-
ling all problems with visas and
student standing. '

Miss Lichtenstein feels it has
been “diﬁicult to generate in-
terest in the foreign student.
program because of the type of
campus the University has had;
‘now that we have a meeting
place and areas to share intel-
‘lectual and social ideas, we can

A
V

perhaps make progress in this
— area.” ' V

Miss Lichtenstein emphasizes
that “U.S. Students can beneﬁt
substantially from getting
know these students and learning
about their ideas and countries.‘If
the leaders of tomorrow can -un-
derstand other peoples better than
they do today, perhaps we can

‘learn to live together."

Miss Lichtenstein’s office‘ also
has available information about
opportunities for American stu-
dents to study abroad. Informa-
tion about foreign study programs
c-an also be obtained through the
fellowship office.
