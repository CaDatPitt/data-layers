With Student Government Board
campaigns slated to begin Monday in
preparation for the Nov. 5 elections, it was
announced Wednesday morning that two
candidates will be running for the presi-
dential position.

And neither are strangers to the
demands of government life.

For David Teeters, current SGB
member, student government has been a
part of his four-year collegiate experi-
ence.

For Gerald Klayman, current SGB
allocations chair, govemment responsibil-
ities have brought their share of trials and
tribulations.

Because of the recent frenzy sur-

rounding last month's resignation of
Allocations Committee members, who
cited poor handling of student activities
ftmds, both candidates are expecting to
confront the issue of allocations within
their respective campaigns.

"The allocations process must be
redeﬁned," Teeters said. "I propose mak-

 

ing the Student Government Board sub-
ject to the regular budgetary processes of
the University. This would eliminate
many of the conﬂicts within the Student
Government oﬁice and allow‘ the alloca-
tions process to be directed at effectively
distributing funds to support student orga-
nizations."

Klayman said, if elected, he would
place SGB under an operating budget in
order to curb spending. However, he said
he would continue to advocate making
student activity money more accessible to
campus organizations.

"I see no point in having $160,000
sitting in a bank account and not beneﬁt-
ting student groups," he said. "It should
not be spent frivolously, but it should be
spent. I want to help student groups get
the money they rightfully deserve."

While allocations is an anticipated
hot—button issue, it isn't the only one set to
ignite the interest of the student body.

Klayman will be revisiting the issue
of campus concerts.

Rush Week on campus
sure isn't Animal House

Jessyca Vandercoy

For The Pltt News

Big drinking parties, Hell Week
and hazing are all considered part of
the tradition of joining a fraternity
while at college.

Fraternities at Pitt, however,
claim that none of these activities —
immortalized by the movie Animal
House — occur during Pitt’s frater-
nity Rush, which ends this week.

They say the fun resides instead
in getting to know other guys on
campus.

Fraternity Rush Week kicked off
on Oct. 1. The ensuing week and a
half has been filled with events for
freshman and sophomore males to
attend in order to become familiar
with the different fraternities and
their brothers.

Events such as “Cheesesteaks
and Fries,” “Caribbean Cool—Off”
and “Icelandic Shrimp Feast” have
filled the week as aspiring brothers
gather at different fraternity houses
to learn about each one and what it
has to offer.

Reed Nyffler, a rushee, dis-
agrees with people who say that

joining a fraternity is simply a way
of buying friends.

“The fees are for the things the
fraternity does during the year, not
for friendship,” said Nyffler, “I
enjoy hanging out with the guys and
don’t know many people on campus.
Rush is a great way to meet people
who like to do the things I like to
do.” .

Bill Shine, another freshma
rushee, says he feels that Rush
offers incoming freshmen a great
opportunity to meet new people.

“It‘s the way to go for that,” he
said.

Recently, school officials have
begun cracking down on fraternities
during Rush. In fact, Rush in recent
years has become a dry event-for all
fraternities, meaning they can’t
serve alcohol during that period.

Another issue among fraternities
during Rush Week is hazing - the
foolish pranks that were once
required of rushees in order to
become initiated- which is now
being viewed as a serious offense.

Candidates for Student Government Board discuss the campaign at last night’s meeting.

15 students begin the race
for eight spots on SGB

Nora O’Ne||l

For the Pltt News

Student Government Board elec-
tions are set for Wednesday, Nov. 5,
and the 15 SGB hopefuls are prepar-
ing for a competitive race for the
eight board positions.

Problems that have occurred
within the allocations process have
been a major issue for students on

campus, and several candidates
responded to the concerns.

Young "Jay" Park, a freshman
candidate, was inspired to run after
learning of the allocations problems.

"I was reluctant to run for SGB,”
said Park, “but when the allocations
scandal came up, it made me realize
that any person who was committed

Bonfire on the Cathedral Lawn
will fire up fans for ND game

Lisa Grzyboski
Senior Staff Writer

Cotton candy, Pitt -T—shi1ts galore,
fall varsity sports teams, and don’t forget
one rather large bonﬁre in the middle of
the Cathedral Lawn. It’s all about Pitt
Panther pride.

In an effort to start a new tradition
and strengthen support for Pitt athletics,
student groups and University depart-
ments around campus have worked to
make the “Let’s Get Fired Up!” bonfire
event a success.

Student leaders hailing from the
Blue and Gold Society, Student
Government Board and Pitt Program
Council joined with officials from eight
University departments to work towards
transforming the Cathedral Lawn into a
carnival atmosphere this Thursday
evening.

Free T—shirts, radio broadcasting by
The X 105.9 FM, a dunking booth, the
marching band and a ﬁlm screen sus-
pended from the Cathedral walls are
expected to entice thousands of students
to the lawn and add to the festivities.

While the bonﬁre is in preparation
for the football game against Notre
Dame this Saturday, it is also serving as
a venue to highlight all fall varsity ath-
letes and create a buzz of campus excite-
ment in the process. .

“All fall varsity sport teams were
asked to attend,” said Alyson Wallach,
president of the Blue and Gold Society, a
student organization that works with the
Alumni Association to promote Pitt
pride. ‘This will give them the recogni-
tion they deserve.”

“The team members we have talked
to so far have been so excited,” she
added.

Oddly enough, the idea to light a _

bonﬁre before playing Notre Damewas
ignited by a visit Blue and Gold Society
members made in September to the
University of Notre Dame for a student
conference.

“We went on a conference to Notre
Dame the ﬁrst weekend of the‘ semester,
and we came back with a newfound
appreciation for Pitt and Oakland,”
Wallach said. “We also came back with a
strong desire to do something for the stu-
dents.”

With the desire to create a new Pitt
tradition in place after returning, speciﬁ-
cally one involving a bonfire on the
lawn, Blue and Gold members faced an
uphill battle against time to get the event
going this year.

"We went through ﬁve weeks of
thought and three weeks of intensive
planning," Wallach said.

Blue and Gold wasn’t alone, though.

Departments ranging from Athletics

to Food Services to Environmental

Health and Safety offered their services
in a number of ways.

Pitt's Department of Environmental
Health and Safety "worked with the City
Bureau of Fire and the Allegheny County
Bureau of Air Pollution to approve the
permits required to light a bonfire on the
Cathedral Lawn.

g "Most of the people were very will-
ing to help," said Larry Keller, director of
Environmental Health and Safety.
"Everyone is excited to be doing some-
thing like this because it's a good way to
promote school spirit."

Lori Holmes, marketing manager of
Sodexho, agreed and looked at the bon-

fire as a great way to get involved in the j

student community.

"When Marriott was here, they didn't
get involved with the students at all," she
said. "We are trying to change that and
become involved as much as possible.
It's not about the bottom line anymore,
it's about responding to students. We are
here as a service, not a moneymaker."

Food Services will provide food to
students on the lower Cathedral Lawn
near Forbes Avenue beginning at 5:00
p.m. and continuing until 8:00 p.m.

Because the rally will be focusing on
Pitt's fall sports teams, the Department of
Athletics was quick to join the fray.

"I thought [the bonﬁre] was a great
idea," said Jim Earle, assistant athletics
director for merchandising and game day
marketing. "It is very exciting and
encouraging to have an event like this
being initiated by the student body."

Surprised to receive support on such
a large scale, many student leaders
reﬂected on what this event means to the
campus.

"It is incredible to see how many dif-
ferent organizations have come together
to make this happen," said Scott Gabriel,
special events chair for the Blue and
Gold Society. "A bonﬁre has been done
only a few times on campus, and to see
this attitude on campus with everybody
helping out, it's amazing."

The rally will begin at approximate-
ly 8:15 p.m. after the marching band
completes its "snake dance" across cam-
pus. Highlights from this year's football
season will be shown, and football
Coach Walt Harris — along with two
football players —-—— is scheduled to speak
brieﬂy. Also, fall varsity athletes will be
honored and Pitt ﬁght songs will be
sung.

"It's wonderful. Department heads
who never met each other have ﬁnally
been introduced with this meeting. They
are already planning for future events,"
Wallach said. "If the goal for the year
was to’ create a Pitt proud community,
then we've ﬁnally created the communi-
ty, and hopefully the bonﬁre will make it

Pitt proud."

PRESIDENT

"Bringing musical concerts to this
university will be central to my campaign
and it could be and will become a reality
if I am elected," he said. "We have the
facilities, andywe have the students that
want to do it. These kinds of things have
to be done in order to make Pitt a better
school."

Academic issues and residence life
concerns will be emphasized by Teeters,
who has spent much of his time as a board
member working in these two areas. .

In academics, Teeters is looking to
concentrate on getting administrators to
consider student input when deciding on
changes within the undergraduate core
curriculum.

Housing remains his main concern
regarding the issue of on—campus student
life.

"We have to make sure the
University's priorities are in the right
place," he said.’"This includes quality of
life issues like building student dorms.
Pitt needs to commit resources towards
the construction of a new residence hall."

While taking a different route,
Klayman is also incorporating student life
issues into his campaign, primarily in the
area of ﬁnancial aid and holding the
University accountable for how money is

spent.
"You see this sidewalk, notice the dif-

FROM PAGE 1

ference in color," Klayman said while
pointing to the area outside the Fifth
Avenue side of the William Pitt Union.
"Over _the summer, the administration
chose to spend money to ﬁx the sidewalk.
The previous sidewalk was just ﬁne. To
ﬁx something that is ﬁne is totally super-
ﬂuous. The money that was used for this
could have gone towards student scholar-
ships."

Despite their obvious differences, the
two candidates hold a similar belief: a
more diverse team and cooperation are
essential to having a strong student gov-
ernment board.

"We must work together as a team
and respect each member of the team,"
Teeters said. "The ideas of everyone must
be taken into account. From being a board
member that was on the outskirts of many
issues and decisions, I know how it feels.
I want to incorporate everyone as a team
player."

Klayman will be highlighting cultur-
al awareness as a major component of his
campaign, something he believes will
help strengthen the idea of a Pitt Proud
community.

"I believe that we can learn a lot from
each other," he said. "Everyone sees
things differently and has experiences to
share. These differences can be used to
beneﬁt the community."

Pitt Proud Community activities
set to run on campus all year

Last Year, Dr. Robert Gallagher
observed a lack in school spirit among
Pitt students.

With the help of the Student
Government Board, Gallagher, the inter-
im vice-chancellor for student affairs, is
determined to change that trend this year.

SGB and the Ofﬁce of Student
Affairs will join forces this year to stir up
school spirit in Pitt students by sponsor-
ing activitiesthroughout the school year
that concentrate on "helping us [the uni-
versity] feel better about ourselves," said
Gallagher. They dubbed this program
"Pitt Proud Community."

"I just felt that [the students] weren't
hearing enough good things about the
University," said Gallagher.

From January to April, Gallagher put
"Pitt Pride" ads in The Pitt News —— ads
whose purpose was to inform students of
Pitt trivia. At the end of the semester, stu-
dents were given a chance to participate
in a contest quizzing their knowledge of
Pitt.

The questions on the quiz, such as
"Pitt is one of only 17 schools selected for
inclusion in the book The Public Ivy,"
indicating the ivy league quality of the
school, and "Pitt is one of only about 40

colleges and universities to offer a degree
in African American Studies" were taken
from those used in the ads. Students who
answered a majority of the questions cor-
rectly were given gift certiﬁcates to the
campus bookstore.

Although the program is still in its
formative stages, SGB and Student
Affairs plan to host many activities this
year to generate pride in the University,
including a contest similar to last year’s in
which students can win T-shirts for
answering Pitt trivia correctly.

"The activities are our way to build a
Pitt Proud Community," said SGB mem-
ber Marquette Bowman.

This week, students were given a
chance to sign a barmer wearing the logo
"We're Panther Proud." SGB will hang
the banner in the stadium on Saturday for
the Pittsburgh versus Notre Dame foot-
ball game.

Bowman said he hopes the program
will initiate "more student involvement
on every level of the University as well as
pride in our University."

"I think it's good for the atmosphere
of the University for people to feel proud
about where they are," said Gallagher.

A complete calendar of events for the
Pitt Proud Community project will be
available on Oct. 13.

In fact, being found guilty of hazing
is grounds for abolishment of the fra-
ternity chapter on campus.

“Our fraternity can’t afford haz-
ing,” said Bill Scislore, a brother in
the Delta Tau Delta fraternity. “The
national chapter and the University
don’t allow it. It just doesn’t occur.“

If the traditions of the old-school
Rush Week have been limited and are
being rigorously controlled by the
University, is joining a fraternity still
fun? Does attending the “Caribbean
Cool-Off” fulfill the expectations
that a prospective brother has? Is
being part of a fraternity still about
alcohol and partying?

Bob Stibbens, a freshman in the

midst of rushing, says he thinks that
Rush, so far, has been a lot of fun.

“I’ve met a lot of people, and
although the actual Rush events have
been a little dry, we still find ways to
party,” he said.

Mark Chrystal, a brother in the
Delta Tau Delta fraternity, doesn’t
think that Rush is about parties,
rather about showing independents
what fraternities are about.

“Fraternities do a lot of charity
work. We take pride in that,” he said.
“During Rush we can show off our
house and the trophies we have
earned. That is one of the good
points about fraternities that many
people don’t acknowledge.”

to being honest with the students
could stop the corruption on the
board."

Damon Hudac, a junior candi-
date, was similarly upset by the allo-
cations issue. -

“I feel they totally forgot how to
be effective board members," he said.

Candidate Adam
Tekel, however, felt
that there was no allo-
cations scandal.

''It was blown way
out of proportion,” he
explained. “SGB
should still have the
final say on alloca-
tions, but better com-
munication is needed.”

At least one candi-
date is focusing her
campaign on student
safety instead.

Jennifer Karch, a

such as class descriptions, require-
ments, and professorial options
available to students through the
Internet.

"I am currently serving on the
Academic Affairs Committee, and
we're working on this project,” he
said. “I want to continue this work as
an SGB member.”

Two hopefuls see
food services as a
major issue to push
during the election.

"I'd like to see a late-
night eatery become
available for students,”
said sophomore Tekel.
“I have worked in the
Food Service Office
and could work closely
with food—service offi-
cials on this project."

Park is also con—
cerned with the issue of

sophomore, is con— "
cerned with educating students about
several campus—safety issues.

"Students should be made more
aware of dangers in surrounding
areas like North and South Oakland,”
she said. “The addition of better
lighting, more emergency phones and
safety seminars, especially for fresh-
men, would help the students to bet-
ter protect themselves."

Sophomore Ellen Kyzer, Karch's
running mate, focused on protecting
student financial aid.

"1 want to inform the students
about the college—aid issues that are
being decided in the government,”
she said. “I want to give them a voice
by circulating petitions and keeping
them informed about decisions that
may affect their ability to receive an
education."

One candidate is centering his
campaign on an academic web page.

George Mongell, a sophomore,
plans to make academic information

food services as the
election nears.

"I would like to see food service
improved," he said. “Just because
you don’t live at home doesn’t mean
you shouldn’t be able to have a meal
that tastes home—cooked.”

Communication was one issue
that nearly every candidate stressed
when discussing their campaign plat-
forms.

For example, candidate Elizabeth
Klein stressed the importance of stu-
dent feedback if there are to be
improvements in the quality of life
on campus. '

"I want the students to realize
that SGB members are just regular
students working for them, and they
should feel comfortable approaching
them," she said.

Kyzer agreed.

"I‘d like to see the town meetings
better publicized so that the students
won't miss an opportunity to address
the board with their concerns.”

Baby hidden in teen’s room
discovered after two weeks

Across the Nation

CENTRAL ISLIP, N.Y. — Doctors
say a 4—pound baby boy is doing well
after spending two—and—a—half weeks
hidden in a teenager's bedroom. .

Police in Central Islip, N.Y., say‘

that Shanta Clark kept the baby hidden
after giving birth at home. She had
never told anyone she was pregnant.

She was feeding the baby, but she
left him alone for eight hours a day
while she went to school.

Clark's mother called the police-

after she found the baby in her daugh-
ter's closet. I

A pediatrician’ says the boy, born
five weeks premature,_ is somewhat
underweight but is in stable condition
and seems to be doing well. _

She says premature infants have a
weak cry, which could explain why no
one heard him. a

WASHINGTON — Backers of a ban

MOSCOW —— It's a day late, but it is
still a welcome arrival at the Russian
MIR space station.

. A cargo ship has docked with MIR
carrying a backup computer and some
other crucial supplies, including drink-

The docking was delayed for a day
because another supply ship that had
been occupying the docking port

. would not detach on command on
Monday.

It turned out that the crew had not
unhooked one of the latches holding
the ship to the port. After the latch was
released, the undocking proceeded
smoothly. «

  W Irish eyes
are crying 

Notre Dame kicked the holy hell out of us last
year when nobody gave a damn about the Panther
team.

Temple beat us up when there was no crowd sup-
port and no excitement to push them on last week.

This team needs excitement. It needs you there to
yell and scream and shout and push Notre Dame’s
place kicker into your hibachi after the game.

The Irish are a good team that we actually have a
chance to beat. In fact, we can kill them. They’re 1-4,
and we look better in their own colors than they do.

We can kick those church-boys up and. down the
ﬁeld until they’re an all-soprano choir.

We can tie their jerseys up on the goal post that we
don’t rip down. And‘ the post we do rip down we can
give to Ron Powlus for an enema.

It won’t be easy, but there is strength in numbers.

Imagine being a Notre Dame player, trying to play
a game with 56,150 screaming nutcases yelling, “We
want blood! We want blood!” That can’t be fun.

The last we knew, there were quite a few tickets
left for the game Saturday afternoon. Go get one now;
And while you’re out, get a dozen eggs to throw at
Notre Dame’s bus as itgrides into our town.

There’s an old Singapore proverb that says, “It
takes a whole village to cane a child.”

That’s exactly what it takes. So go be a part of it.
You’ll have a lot more fun being there in person than
you would sitting at home watching a ﬂat screen.
Only‘ if you’re there can you take part in the second
school-spirit bonﬁre this week .— the big one where
the Fighting Irish get burned.

Walt Harris has done a helluva job giving our guys i

a New Attitude. He screamed at them and pulled them
to their feet by their hair. ‘Now just screaming is
enough to make them stand up and fight.
Congratulations, Harris: Pavlov and his dogs would
be proud. '

Now lunch is on its way, and it’s time for us to ring
the dinner bell. .

Let’s all show Notre Dame’s kids out new atti-
tude, too.

Age doesn't mean much in dating

Allson Novickl
columnlst

Contrary to an argument in
one of last week’s columns con-
cerning dating guidelines, I think
that age is not such an important
issue when it comes to dating, and
that the law is the only thing that

‘should stop two people from dat-

ing each other. That is, when there
are serious criminal consequences
involved, two people should not
be dating, but other than that,
there should be no rigid rules.

Beyond the point when one
reaches the legal age of consent,
everything else involved in dating
is based on something that can’t
be measured or regulated: one’s
morals, values, tastes and maturi-
ty. Because these things can’t be
regulated or measured, and
because they are not included in
the law, it is not feasible or rea-
sonable to lay down rules or
guidelines for who should be dat-
ing_ whom.

And sometimes, even the law
is not entirely acceptable when it
comes to this type of decision.

In theory, the law is correct to
pinpoint a particular age for con-
sent, because it is obvious that at
some point in life one becomes
capable of making those kinds of
decisions. ”

So, does that mean that at
after a certain age, people auto-
matically become capable of
making decisions about sex?

No.

, On the other hand, does that
mean that up until that certain age
people are incapable of making
decisions about sex?

No.

I ﬁnd it entirely impossible

for anyone to suddenly be mature
enough to make decisions about
sex. It is obvious that at age 18,
the legal age of consent in
Pennsylvania, there are people
who have not matured as much as
others. But at age 25, there are
people who have still not matured
as much as others.

The point is that there can be
a 16-year-old, an 18-year-old and
a25—year-old who are all at the
same maturity level, and the law
has to make up for that by desig-
nating a particular age. I

That makes sense.

But, it does not make sense to
ﬁnd it unreasonable or unaccept-
able when there is a signiﬁcant
age gap between people who date,
when they are both over the legal
age of consent. “

For example, at 18, a good
friend of mine was dating a 24-
year-old man. Because she was of
legal age, the fact that they were
six years apart should not be an
issue. _

Why? Because there is noth-
ing in the law that says so!

What is the big deal with peo-
ple who are six, 10, or even 20
years apart who date each other?

It happens quite a bit more
often that older men date younger
women than do older women date
younger men, and this is usually
where people start to notice and
make it an issue, though I don’t
know why.

Since I am one of these
young women whom older men
date, I feel the need to defend the
men — which is really sad,
because I shouldn’t need to
defend any man who is adult and
perfectly capable of choosing
who he dates.

THE PITT NEWS

The problem is that people
think that all women are weak,
naive and gullible, and that we are
easily taken advantage of. There
is always a misconception that
“the men going after younger

V women.”

This notion is grossly wrong.

What about people like me N

who usually date men who are
much older than I am?I can speak

. from experience when I say that it

is an entirely different experience
to date older men. I don’t “go
after” older men, but since who
you meet and decide to date is

dependent on where you hang out _

and who your friends are, then it
makes sense that I would date
older men. _

I do not believe that every
guy out there who is not college
age is a dirty oldman who only
wants one thing. (For the clueless,
that “one thing” would be sex.)
The chances of dating a sex-
crazed 30-year-old are the same
as dating a sex-crazed 21-year-
old.

The only defense, and the
best defense, that I have for both
women and men who choose to
date people older than themselves
is this: Why not?

I am not professing that
everyone should go out and date
older people or that everyone in
their 30s should jump on the “col—
lege-age dating bandwagon,” but
I am professing that when you
limit yourself to only dating peo-
ple in a certain age bracket, you
are limiting yourself from much
more.

Alison Novicki thinks that it’s not
your age that matters — it’s how
you ’ve matured with it.

’ columnlst

It was a pretematurally warm
October day in Pittsburgh when I decided
to skip a boring class and hang out in the
park. Unfortunately, I could not keep my
mind off school. -

I obsessed about the fact that the
chancellor just received a bonus of a size
that equals my educational debts. Maybe
it’s just sour grapes thanks to the uncanny
congruence of the ﬁgures, but according
to yesterday’s story in The Pitt News,

Nordenberg received this bonus for,"

among other things, his “pursuit of under-
graduate excellence.” I guess the Board of
Trustees came up with the goal after sev-

. eral millennia of meetings, dinners and

lunches at University expense, and the
chancellor must have said something to
the effect that he supports it. Yrppee, the
chancellor didn’t say he thought academ-
ic mediocrity was okay. Wow, what a con-
cept, how brilliant and original! Give that
man a $30,000 bonus! ’

Here I am in the park, skipping a
$600 class (one—ﬁftieth of the chancellor’s
bonus, by the way) because it is a dull,
stupid requirement and I only need it to
graduate. I have a suggestion for
Nordenberg in his oh-so-time-consuming
and arduous pursuit of undergraduate aca-
demic excellence:

Develop a system whereby students

THE PITT NEWS

can get a refund on a lousy product.
Because of the brevity of the add—drop-
with-full—refund period, many inferior
classes are bought and paid for before the
student has time to realize the poor quali-
ty of the goods. By the time a student real-
izes that either the curriculum, the book
and/or the instruction is defective and not
worth $600, there is no recourse within
the system.

If it is a required class, often there I

will be no alternatives that work with the

student’s schedule anyway. So the stu-'9

dents don’t complain because there’s no
solution anyway; they just skip class and
don’t study and_ tell their friends that Pitt
sucks and engage in other passive-aggres-
sive self—destructive behaviors.

Thus, academic mediocrity (gasp-
shock—horror) is perpetuated all around.
Now ask yourself, do you think these stu-
dents are: a) going to get fantastic jobs
where they earn loads of _money; and/or b)
going to donate to their alrna mater? And
if you can answer both of these questions
correctly, pass Go and proceed to a top
administrative position earning in excess
of $200, 0()0 per year! ,

I am in the park thinking along these
lines because I am in just such a position
— no, not the 200-grand thing, but the
disgruntled passive-aggressive thing. On
the whole, I have been very happy with‘
the quality of instruction I have received
here at Pitt, and have usually been taught

by full faculty. I have
been a devotee of
Honors College classes
and will definitely
donate to the Honors
College when I
become rich and
famous. I have had
great teachers from
departments as diverse
as neuroscience,
English, the history of
art, physics and chem-
istry. Yet here I am
wasting over $1,000 this semester on two
required classes which both happen to, er,
suck. .
Despite having a minor in neuro-
science, two semesters of biology and
chemistry and one of physics, I am fulﬁll-
ing the “formal and quantitative reason-
ing” requirement, which as far as I can tell
is University welfare for the History and
Philosophy of Science Department. This
class is called “How Science Works.” My
most polite suggestion is that if you want
to know how science works, you should
ask a scientist and not a philosopher.
This class is supposed to explain sci-
ence without the math. Shaky ground.
There would be no modern science with-
out rrrath, and trying to explain many sci-
entiﬁc concepts without math is like try-
ing to hold up the human body without a
skeleton. Mathematics is what rescued

other words, it is an excuse to sit around
bemoaning the fact that discrimination
and prejudice have existed and do exist in
the world and how terrible these things
are. Okay, got it. Now can we move on?
So, whaddya think of my chances of
being offered a job on the board of direc-
tors for my groundbreaking solutions to
the pursuit of academic excellence? I’ll
settle for a $30,000 bonus, hold the job. In
fact, I’d even settle for one—f1ftieth of that.

AmeriCorps is not evil as riglrtists would have you believe

Michael Berquist

Columnist

During his 1992 presidential
campaign, President Clinton won
standing ovations for his pledge
to create a domestic Peace Corps
— a program that would give col-
lege scholarships to young men
and women who volunteer to per-
form full-time community ser-
vice. Called the AmeriCorps, this
program has become one of the
most shining of President
Clinton’s achievements.

Unsurprisingly, this -has led
many critics of the president to
aggressively target the program
for destruction. I would argue that
these individuals ought to careful-
ly examine their rhetoric. In their
efforts to score a victory against
the president, they risk eliminat-
ing a program that has done much
to help America’s youth.

In a 1993 open letter to the
Republican congressional leader-
ship entitled “National Service -
Truly Republican,” GOP
Congressman Christopher Shays
of Connecticut and 15 other
Republicans protested efforts
made by more right-wing mem-

bers of their party to totally elim-
inate the AmeriCorps.

Shays and his colleagues
wrote: “We believe national ser-
vice is a basic Republican idea,
[and] that the president’s proposal
is structured as a Republican
might have structured it.” Indeed,
money for the AmeriCorps is dis-
tributed through the states to local
nonproﬁt groups, which must
compete with others for the grant
money.

Competition? Grants?

‘What’s wrong with that? Isn’t that

what the Republicans in
Congress pledged to do with the
entire government when they
were elected to Congress in
1994? Must have slipped their

, minds.

Congressman Shays and the
other congressmen who signed

that ‘ letter aren’t ' the only‘
Republicans to voice supportfor .

the concept of a paid national-ser-

vice prograrn. National Review,
‘founder and editor William F.

Buckley wrote an entire book,
“Gratitude,” on the need for a
paid national-service program.
The bipartisan support among
President Clinton, congressional

Democrats and moderate
Republicans has managed to pre-
serve and protect the -AmeriCorps
from being cut from the budget,
but the AmeriCorps’ critics are
many and powerful.

House Speaker Newt
Gingrich, an avowed foe of
national service, made the bizarre
claim in a speech criticizing the
AmeriCorps that those who serve
in the program “become not only
useless, they become dangerous.”
Dangerous? People helping peo-
ple is dangerous? I’d hate to live
in Newt Gingrich’s vision of an
ideal America.

So what are some of the
activities these “dangerous”
Americans engage in? Things
like helping communities create
neighborhood safety watches,
teaching children how to read,
rebuilding public parks, and car-
ing for the sick and the elderly.

In addition to the services
they provide, what makes the
AmeriCorps such a great pro-
gram is the positive impact it has
had on the lives of those who par-
ticipate, and the educational and
technical skills these individuals
gain as a result.

One AmeriCorps member
told a newspaper reporter last
year of his life before joining the
organization: “I wasn’t doing
anything but hanging out on cor-
ners, going out with my friends
and stealing cars.” Thanks to his
experience in the AmeriCorps,
this individual is now on course
to become a ﬁreﬁghter and a pro-
ductive member of society
instead of living a life of crime as
a member of an irmer—city gang
like far too many other kids from
America’s cities have.

Critics have charged that the
program is inefficient, but the
reality is that the AmeriCorps
couldn’t possibly give the public
more bang for its buck. In addi-
tion to providing valuable experi-
ence for those participating in the
program, the AmeriCorps has
saved taxpayers a small fortune
on the services provided to the
community.

For example, the federal gov-

I emment has spent $500 million in

recent years on child immuniza-
tion; now that is the very model
of inefficiency and waste —
spending a small fortune to

immunize a few children. -In the

summer of 1993, 90 AmeriCorps
volunteers in Texas participated
in a program to immunize
105,000 children at a cost of just
$300,000 to taxpayers. The
AmeriCorps cut through the red
-tape that afflicts many govem-
ment projects and got the job
done.

Unfortunately, the
AmeriCorps’ impressive record
hasn’t stopped "some from
launching assault after assault on
the program. One Republican
observer complained: “It’s tragic
to cut these programs. Why shoot
a bunch of innocent kids just to
get ‘at the president?” Why
indeed? The AmeriCorps is a
model of efficiency and meets
every common-sense test there is.
I would like to encourage all of

my fellow students to contact

their representatives in Congress
and encourage them to not only
keep, the AmeriCorps but to
expand it. America would be the
better for it.

Michael Berquist thinks that the
president’s National Service
Program has been a major suc-
cess.

They carried cement blocks up
“Cardiac Hill,” pushed cars across the
football field and cut down trees using
sledge hammers.

These drills were completed during
summer training camp to prepare the
Panther football squad for its demand-
ing 1997 schedule.

And aside from an early-season
contest at Happy Valley, it wasn’t sup-
posed to get any tougher than this
weekend. This Saturday, Oct. 11, the
Panthers face a battle with the most sto-
ried football juggernaut in the NCAA,
the Fighting Irish of Notre Dame.

But things have changed. The Irish
are 1-4, and the Panthers, despite an
early-season string of miracles, are
coming off an unexpected loss last
week to the Temple Owls after their
offense faltered.

Head Coach Walt Harris has
stressed an offensive recovery this
week in practice, especially among the
offensive linemen.

“Our ability to dominate [Notre
Dame] will be our ability to play the
front line,” said Harris. “Last week,
there were times when the play was
called to the left, but [blocking] was
actually executed to the right  We are
inconsistent.”

The defensive front will need to
prepare as well — Harris added that the
Notre Dame offensive line is the
biggest that Pitt has faced since its sea-
son opener against Southwest
Louisiana.

Several changes on the offensive
side of the ball have been made for the
upcoming game. Look for senior
Reggie Thomas to replace sophomore
Ben Kopp at starting right guard. Also,
junior Chris Schneider replaces fresh-
man Tony Thompson at fullback.

Injured junior wide-out Terry
Murphy is probable, but if he does not
return this week, freshman Cheo Angel
will start in his place.

Aside from Murphy’s bumps, a few
injuries still plague the Panthers. Trey
McCray, the redshirt sophomore, is out
for the season with a knee injury. Knee

injuries have also benched senior line-

Johnson averages about 55
receiving yards per game. Although
he has struggled to put points on the
board for the Irish, he has had some
big games, including a 106-yard per-

Michigan on Sept. 27.

According to Davie, the offense
hasn’t been the problem this season
for Notre Dame.

“Offensively, we’ve been able to
move the ball,” said Davie. “Our
problem is we haven’t had the ball.
We’re having trouble stopping peo-
ple.” ~

Defensively, Notre Dame has
struggled this season. Notre Dame
has been outscored 118 to 70 and has
given up 20 or more points in its last
four contests.

“We’ve struggled on defense,”
admitted Davie. “We’re young and
real thin up front. Last week
Stanford had two backs over 100

Pete Gonzalez “officially” oust-
ed teammate Matt Lytle from his
reign as Pitt’s starting quarterback
during August’s pre-season camp,
but Gonzalez reallywon the job
many months before he ever screwed
on a helmet. ‘

“He spent a tremendous amount
of time studying film by himself

' over the summer,” said Head Coach

Walt Harris. “He worked hard at
becoming a better player, and he
came to camp ready to play.”

His dedication to learning the
intricacies of Pitt’s new West Coast
offense has already paid substantial
dividends. He’s thrown just three
interceptions compared to his 10
touchdowns — a ratio that leads the
Big East. In Pitt’s first five games,
he has completed nearly 55 percent
of his passes and is averaging 174.4
yards passing a game.

“In this offense there are more
places to go with the football,” said
Gonzalez, comparing this year’s
scheme to the 1996 offense. “It’s
like going from a station wagon to a
Cadillac.”

But besides the statistical side of
his game, Gonzalez has displayed
the unteachable talent of knowing
when stay in the pocket and when to
tuck the pigskin and run.

senior Gonzalez runs to glory

“He’s becoming more
confident with some of
the success we’ve had,”
said , Harris.
“Considering the
t r e m e n d o u s
amount of infor-
mation he has to
know, he has a
very good under-
standing of the
offense.”

His play-mak-

“He’s miles and miles ahead of
where he was when I first saw him
play last year,” said Harris. “He’s
growing up rapidly. He’s becoming a
better player and person as the sea-
son goes on.”

Unlike his erratic apperances in
his first four seasons, Gonzalez has
taken all but one meaningful snap
this season (Lytle saw mop-up duty
versus Penn State). Unlike his sec-
ond-rate status in the eyes of the
coaching staff and the fans alike in
his undergraduate days, the senior
has developed into a team leader.

And in his last season, his first in
front of packed houses and national
spotlights, Gonzalez appears ready
to lead his team into battle against
the Fighting Irish.

“I think it’ll be an exciting
game,” said Gonzalez when asked
about the contest. “A fun game to

“We have a good shot at beating
them.” -

Jenkins fights back from
iniury to anchor secondary

Joh nkinc k m serious knee
damage less than a month after his surgery.

Staff Wrlter

Heading into training camp this
summer, the Panthers ﬁgured to be
very thin on the defensive side of the
ball, particularly in the defensive sec-
ondary.

Since Pitt had little depth, it would
count heavily on the very few experi-
enced players on its roster. A quick
glance at the Panther roster, and John
Jenkins’ name jumped out immediate-
ly.

The free safety had played in 33
consecutive games going into this sea-
son, starting the last 22 of those. He
had chalked up ﬁve interceptions and

I 141 tackles.

The coaches could breath a sigh of
relief -- at least they had an experi-
enced cornerstone to build the new
Mad Dog defense around.

But any Pitt fan knows that luck
never seems to work in favor of the
Panthers. As training camp wound to a

close, Jenkins tore up his knee and
needed surgery to repair the tendon and
ligament damage.

There’s no way that a team with so
few top-notch players would have any
chance with its best defender out for
the year, right?

Wrong on two counts.

First, the Panther defense explod-
ed out of the gate, playing with a fero-
ciousness that no one expected. The
defense also had a few more stars than
most people thought.

The pure athletic ability of con-
verted quarterback Darnell Dinkins
enabled him to ﬁll the void at free safe-
ty, despite having virtually no experi-
ence at the position, while Jenkins
rehabbed his knee.

Then”"the amazing happened. Just
four weeks after going under the knife,
Jenkins retumed to the starting lineup
against  Pitt managed to beat
Southwestern Louisiana and Houston
without Jenkins’ services, but Miami
was ranked 22nd, and the nationally-

televised contest was the ﬁrst Big East
game of the year.

Since defensive backs rely so
heavily on their speed, many people
did not expect to see the John Jenkins
of old. There would be no way his knee
wouldbe in game shape.

But Jenkins turned in a perfor-
mance that stopped any and all specu-
lation pretty quick. He made nine tack-
les, had ﬁve pass deﬂections and had
an all-important interception in the
game’s ﬁnal minutes to secure the vic-
tory. The performance eamed him Big
East Defensive Player of the Week
honors.

As if these accomplishments
aren’t amazing enough, it’s even more
unbelievable considering he played
cornerback versus the Hurricanes,
which is not even his natural position.

“Chuck Brown was injured, and
Hank Poteat was learning a new posi-
tion. I have to be ﬂexible in order to
help the team.” Jenkins said of the

Tony Orlandini has never been to
California, but his ﬁrst taste of Walt Harris’
new West Coast offense seems to be suiting
him just ﬁne. .

It’s not just a new offensive strategy

. that’s been instilled in the Pitt offense, it’s

also the hard work ethic that’s been instilled
in Orlandini, his offensive linemates, and in
the team as a whole.

Funny. “Hard wo ” might as well be
Orlandini’s middle name.

' That ethic is what deﬁnes Orlandini;
it’s been with him since his days growing
up in West Wyoming, Pa. He cites his par-
ents and his older brother Roger, who cap-
tained Eastern Kentucky’s football team
last year, as his three biggest motivators.
Orlandini believes that his ability to work
hard is his biggest asset.

“My brother and I always pushed each
other and made each other strive for better
things,” he said.

Orlandini’s still striving. Ask Pitt line-
men Andrew Grischow and Jason
Sepkowski, and ask just about anyone else
who watches Panther football, about the
offensive tackle’s hard work and intense
style of play.

“He brings stability, intelligence and
smash—mouth football all together in one,”
explains Grischow. “It’s a mixture of every-
thing.”

and a good leader,”

After being redshirted his freshman

Now a sophomore, Graham has grown
from inexperienced backup to a defensive
leader anchoring the left side of the Mad
Dog defense from his newfound position.

“It has beneﬁted me,” said Graham of
the move. “I want to help the team. I’m pro-
ducing, I’m young, and I’m learning.”

According to Graham, his mix of
unselﬁsh play and intensity had its roots
planted at the armual Panther summer camp
in Johnstown. It was here where the players
discovered a new deﬁnition of pain, and
gained an instant respect for hard-driving

ophy. “It’s not team me, it’s team we.” _

When the team fails or succeeds, there is
no ﬁnger pointing. The players do so either
way as a unit.

Graham says he has come a long way
since his playing days at Philadelphia’s John
Bartram High School, but he admits there is
much room for improvement.

“I was never one who knew the game,”
Graham , explained “Once I clean up my

The line has performed well despite
such adversities as the loss of starting nose
tackle Frank Moore, who will miss the
game against the Irish due to knee trouble.

Of comse, thechanges in attitude may
have hit a snag recently, and “What went
wrong at Temple?” has become the most-
asked question of Pitt players.

“I don’t think it was the off-week,” said
Graham, dismissing the 16 days between

In the Panthers’ next game against

safety. He turned in a solid perfonnance
despite the team’s 21-17 loss, and his
injury.

“[My knee] won’t be 100 percent
until the off-season,” he said. “It’s very
close, probably over 85~percent, and it’s
getting better every day.”

Overall, Pitt’s new Mad Dog defense
has been impressive this season.

“It’s a great scheme. It allows us to
attack the line of scrimmage,” Jenkins

explained. “But the biggest differences
from last year are the team’s attitude and
mentality.”

Jenkins and his defensive teammates 8

hope to have a better showing this week-
end against Notre Dame than they did
against Temple, where the gave up 225
yards rushing.

The Irish come into the contest with
a surprising 1-4 record, but Jenkins warns
that those numbers might be deceiving.

“Notre Dame is an excellent team.
They’ve got a lot of talent on both sides
of the ball, and they’re huge up front,” he
said. “They’re 1-4, but they’ve lost to
some good teams, and they’ve had some
bad luck.”

Pm

Other players to look for include
senior
Schulters and senior offensive line-
man Tony Orlandini. Schulters ranks
third in the Big East in all-purpose
yards. He leads the Panthers in‘rush-
ing yardage with 326 yards on 73
carries. The scat-back has caught 11
passes for 92 yards and averages
124.8 total yards a game. Doubling
as the team’s kickoff returner,
Schulters averages 20.6 yards per
return with 206 yards on 10 attempts.
All-American candidate Tony
Orlandini is an integral part of the
team’s offensive line. He is expected
to start at left tackle.

Expect to see the Panthers con-
centrate on their passing game this
week, because it has proved very
effective this season. Fifth-year
senior quarterback Pete Gonzalez
has completed over 50 percent of his
passes and has a total of 872 yards.
He has thrown 10 touchdown passes,
ranking him near the top of the Big
East. Gonzalez also is second in the
least interceptions thrown with three.

Coach Harris believes that the
Panthers’ performance and attitude
will be the keys to winning the
upcoming game.

“Last week at Temple, the team
that showed up wasn’t the team from
the last four games  Notre Dame is
a bigger and stronger team than we
are  Our team must play hard and
emotionally.” Harris added, “We are
capable of winning.”

The defense features senior right
end Melvin Dansby, who leads the
team with 49 total tackles. Junior
outside linebacker Lamont Bryant,
at 6-3, 250, leads the team with two
sacks. The other outside linebacker,
junior Cory Minor, leads the team in
interceptions with two.

As a team, Notre Dame has
given up only 970 passing yards in
five games — an ominous stat for
Pete Gonzalez and the Pitt passing
attack. Junior strong safety Benny
Guilbeaux and right cornerback
Allen Rossum have been the strong
points of the Irish secondary. They
each have one interception to date.

Special teams for Notre Dame,
on the other hand, has not been a
strong point this season. Punt
returner Rossum has returned five
punts for 18 yards, and Denson has
returned one punt for 13 yards. Last
season against Pitt, Notre Dame
returned six punts for 231 yards and

not be able to rely solely on punt
returns.

Davie brings his Fighting Irish
into town with a 20-8 record at Pitt
Stadium and a 64-26-2 mark against
Big East teams. But it will be a chal-
lenge for an uncharacteristically
weak Irish squad, not a game to be
taken lightly. “It’s pretty obvious
where we are as a football team.
Anytime you’re 1-4, you’re looking
to win anyway you can. We’re strug-
gling right now.” said Davie.

 

Public emy
Powlus comes
home

Ron Powlus was Berwick, Pa., foot-
ball in the early ‘90s. A

He was named to every All-
American team known to mankind.

He was the Gatorade Circle of
Champions Player of the Year, as well as
the" Player of the Year according to
Parade magazine, SuperPrep, Football
News, the Columbus Touchdown Club,
the Atlanta Touchdown Club, the Tampa
Bay Quarterback Club and Mad maga-
zine.

In 1992 he led the Berwick Bulldogs
to a 15-0 record and the USA Today
mythical national championship.

Powlus was the top prospect in the
country and was ready to verbally com-
rnit to Pitt. .

That is, before he was born again and
made the pilgrimage to Notre Dame.

Beano Cook did everything but
rename the Heisman Trophy after
Powlus. .

Just in case you haven’t noticed, Ron
hasn’t lived up to his overbilling.

In fact, despite the ﬁve Notre Dame
school records held by the 6-3, 225-
pound slinger, he has done little at South
Bend.

That is, compared to what he could
have done here.

In 1993 Pitt’s starting signal caller
was John Ryan. ’

Powlus is better than John Ryan at
probably everything.

Not everything on the football ﬁeld
— everything in general: reading, writ-
ing, walking, you know, basic motor
skills.

In 1994 the Panthers were led all sea-
son by the two—headed monster of Ryan
and Sean Fitzgerald.

We already know Powlus is better

than Ryan, and Ryan is better than
Fitzgerald. So  by the transitive proper-
ty of geometry that states if A=B and
B=C, then A==C.

Okay, maybe I twisted it around a bit,
but I doubt whether Ryan or Fitzy knows
or cares what I’m‘talking about anyway.

Ryan won the job again in 1995
before he ﬁnally left Pitt for greener pas-
tures.

Matt Lytle, a fresh new face, was the
fearless leader of the offensive troops in
1996. Had Powlus captained our troops
that season, he would have had a won-
derful senior campaign, and Lytle would
have been in the Mets’ farm. system,

Women's soccer wins the Backyard Brawl

Patrick Robertson
Staff Wrlter
The Pittsburgh Panthers’

women’s soccer team got its biggest
victory ever last night with a 1-0

‘ win over Big East foe West Virginia.

The Panthers’ win gave them
their first victory ever in the Big
East Conference and came complete
with a Gatorade dousing of their
goal scorer. g

“This has been a long time com-
ing. We are tired of losing because
we know we have the talent. We
have waited way too long for a vic-
tory,” sophomore Megan Beasley
said. i

The first half was slow, but
Panther keeper Nicole Bashor made
sure that her team stayed in the
game by making two key saves early
in the contest.

Twice early in. the half, the
Mountaineers broke in alone on net,
but Bashor’ thwarted both of their
efforts. Each time, she came rolling
out of the net to make the save at the
edge of the goal box. Both shots hit
right in her stomach as she slid
along the ground.

“That’s why we recruited her,”
said Head Coach Roland Sturk.

If a goalie saves breakaways
like that, a team is going to win
games, he added.

“I helped picked up the team.
We were gaining momentum after
the two saves,” said Bashor.

At the half, the score stood 0-0.
Both teams jockeyed back and forth
for much of the second half, neither
having a great scoring chance.

The best chances came late in
the game, and that was when the
Lady Panthers pounced on the
Mountaineers. After they hit three
Crossbars in the game, Pittsburgh
broke through.

Freshman Charity McClure
broke down the right side and made
a move to get around a defender.
She made an ill-advised cross-field
pass that should have been broken
up, but instead slid by a second
defender. That left freshman Renee
Spampinato alone in front of the net
with the ball. 0

The Mountaineer keeper stood
in the center of the net, and
Spampinato blasted the ball to the

lower left corner. The team mobbed
her on the 20-yard-line, and the cel-
ebration began with 10 minutes left
in the game.

“She just crossed the ball, and I
was able to put it in the corner,”
Spampinato said. _

West Virginia tried to push the
ball up the field and the Panthers
denied them any chance at tying the
game. Pittsburgh dominated the last
10 minutes, barely letting West
Virginia cross midfield.

As the game ended, the team
mobbed Spampinato and Bashor and
celebrated a victory in the women’s
soccer edition of the Backyard
Brawl.

“It feels awesome. I mean,
Whoa!” Bashor said of her first col-
legiate victory and shutout.

This win gives the Panthers their
third in the team’s short history.

“This is not the national champi-
onship yet, but it is a big step in the

‘right direction,” Sturk said.

The Panthers travel to Boston
College to try for their second Big
East victory Saturday, and they
return home Oct. 17.

Even though women’s tennis
Coach George Dieffenbach labeled
their 7-2 season-opening victory
over Youngstown State “a good
showing,” the Lady Panthers still
had many unanswered questions
coming into their latest string of
matches. Recent matches included a
tri-meet at the University of
Buffalo, a dual meet at Bucknell,
and a home meet against Robert
Monis.

While the jury is still out, the

Lady Panthers have gone about

addressing these questions in their

own distinct way  on the court.
The Lady Panthers clobbered

Robert Morris yesterday afternoon

" in the team’s first home match of

the season by a ﬁnal of 9-0.

This match saw the ladies yield
only seven games in singles compe-
tition and bolstered the team’s
record to a solid 4-3 on the season.

Pitt’s Lindsay Carlson defeated
Mellissa Thomas 6-2, 6-2, Dana
J afarian beat Abbey Hauck 6-0, 6-1,

and Amanda Hoffman and Fran

Davis both scored convincing 6-0,
6-0 victories. Jen Bible and Allison
Bucher also won convincingly with

identical scores of 6-0, 6-1.

In earlier action, this past week-
end saw the women head to
Bloomsburg to take on not only the
University of Bloomsburg but also
Bucknell in a dual meet. I

The team fell to Bucknell 6-3
and and Bloomsburg 7-2 in the
meet. Freshman Jafarian was the
only Panther to see some sort of
consistent success, as she registered
the team’s only singles victories,
defeating Bucknell’s Wendy Eason
6-4, 6-2 and Bloorr1sburg’s Kara
Evangelista 6-1, 6-2.

Other results for the Lady
Panthers this season include their
last-weekend-of-September trek to
the University of Buffalo for a tri-
meet against Canisius, Buffalo and
Cornell. Saturday the 28th saw the
Panthers take on Canisius and then
Buffalo, while the 29th saw them
take on a highly-touted Cornell
squad.

Against Canisius, Carlson
showed her poise with a thrilling 2-

ry over Karen Armstrong.

“Lindsay came back very
strong in this match. It was really a

season. We played a good match
and pulled out a victory against a

team with players of comparable
abilities to our own,” said Coach
Dieffenbach.

After disposing of Canisius, the
Lady Panthers next took on the host
team of Buffalo, which could best
be described as a “conﬁdence
builder” for the women.

The ladies only lost a total of 17
games in the six matches and dom-
inated the three doubles matches on
their way to the sweep.

against Youngstown State, Canisius
and Buffalo, the ladies were now to
face what Dieffenbach described as,
“the best team we play all year” in
the form of Top 40-ranked Cornell.

The Panthers were only able to
take a meager 25 games for the
entire match —-— a match they lost 9-
0, singles and doubles included —
but Dieffenbach still called the con-
test, “a good experience.”

“Although there were no victo-
ries, the scores were respectable,
and the girls fought through some
close matches. They just need to
work harder. The program learned

and gained a lot from the loss,’~’said '

Dieffenbach.

The team’s next match is at
home Friday against Indiana
University of Pennsylvania.

need to practice, and we can
take advantage of that mom-
ing practice.”

But that decision could
also take away a campus ral-
lying point.

VV1llard said in «an inter-
view last summer that the
main reason Midnight
Madness wasn’t held in 1996
was because it fell on a week-
night.

However, due to the new
regulations, Midnight
Madness does not fall on a
weeknight this season and
never will again. Still,
Wﬂlard was quick to point
out that there was no antici-
pated celebration for Pitt this
October.

“We never really
planned a Midnight Madness
this year,” he said. “There
was no home football game
on the 18th, and most stu-
dents tend‘ to go home on the
weeken .”

Home football or not,
student interest in recent
years has been outstanding;
the last time Midnight
Madness was held two years
ago, it drew the largest crowd

considering

ever packed into I the
Fitzgerald Field House for
the yearly event.

But by bringing together
the basketball Fanfest and the
hottest home football game
of the season, Willard hopes
to generate fan interest in
both sports and to allow for
more player-fan interaction.

“Midnight Madness is

- great for two or three min-

utes,” said Willard, “but after
the opening highlights,
there’s a ﬁve-minute scrim-
mage and a slam-dunk exhi-
bition, and the exhibition lim-
its the player-fan interaction.”
He explained, “This venture
[the fanfest] will be more
friendly to the students and
the fans.” '

In 1995, the event lasted
two hours, complete with
contests, celebrities, appear-
ances by the men’s and
women’s hoops squads, and
speeches from the coaches.

This year’s basketball
celebration will run in con-
junction with the Pitt football
Fanfest —— a similar celebra-
tion involving giveaways and
contests that is run before
every home football game.

Moak picks the military in week seven’s Best Bet

It’s getting to be that time of year. It
happened to Texas earlier; it happened to
Alabama last week Teams that we thought
were good in the pre—season are dropping
out of the Top 25 like ﬂies. The most notable
example of this yearly phenomenon is in
town for the ﬁrst game on this week’s slate

Notre Dame at Pitt (+11)

The Panthers looked pretty bad last
week against Temple, but Notre Dame has
looked pretty bad for most of this season.
Quick, how many Notre Dame players can
you name? Only one - right? Considering
the media attention lavished on the Fighting
Irish, it speaks volumes that nobody outside
of South Bend has ever heard of any of the
Irish players besides quarterback Ron
Powlus. Speaking of Powlus, wouldn’t it be
great if Pitt went to a bowl game this year
and Powlus had to sit on his stoop in
Berwick and watch it on TV? Not that we’re
still bitter about his choice of Notre Dam
over Pitt, or anything  ~
Pitt 28, Notre Dame 24

Ohio State (+7) at Penn State

It’s about time this game ﬁnally hap-
pened. I’m getting tired of seeing Penn State
ranked No. 2 in the country. The Nittany
Lions aren’t even the No. 2 team in their
own conference; they’ll ﬁnd that out
Saturday. Ohio State has already played
Wyoming, Arizona and Iowa, while Penn

    

as

State has been the school-yard bully so far,
beating up on weaklings like Temple,
Louisville and Illinois. And, Ohio State’s
statistics are still more impressive than Penn
State’s. Plus, I wouldn’t trade Ohio State
linebacker Andy Katzenmoyer for Penn
State’s entire defense.

Ohio State 31, Penn State 20

Kentucky (+1 1/2) at South Carolina
The SEC is a high-powered, oifensive-
oriented conference, so its defensive statis-
tics tend to look ugly. Still, it’s never a good
sign when you’re giving up over 30 points
per game in conference games like South
Carolina is. It’s especially not good when
you’re about to face Kentucky, who is the
oonference’s most high-powered, oifensive-
oriented team north of Florida Kentucky
has no nmning game, but if Tim Couch
passes for 400 yards, which he could very
well do this week, it won’t matter.
Kentucky 49, South Carolina 31

Boston College (+19) at Virginia Tech
Remember those cartoons where Elmer

Fudd is out hunting wabbits (wrascally
wabbits, huh huh huh), and just as he’s
about to shoot Bugs Burmy, his gun jams?
You know what happens next: Ehner looks
down the barrel of the gun to see what’s
wrong, and as soon as he points the gun at
his face, it ﬁres. That’s what picking Big
East games is like this year. Just when you
think you have this conference ﬁgured out,
something weird happens, like the Hokies’
losing last week There is one trend that
seems pretty solid: Ifyou don’t count games
involving Rutgers, there have been very few
blowouts in Big East games this year. Ergo,
I’m predicting a close game. ‘
Virginia Tech 37, Boston College 30

Stanford at Arizona (+3)

Arizona has been playing to the level of
its opponents all year. The Wildcats played
well against Ohio State and UCLA, but
struggled last week against San Diego State.
That means they should play pretty well
against Stanford, the No. 16 team in the
country. You’ll notice that Arizona lost all
those games against good teams, though.

-Stanford should be able to run all over‘

Arizona’s defense. Stanford’s defense has-
n’t been a whole lot better, but it doesn’t
need to be.

Stanford 42, Arizona 28

Georgia (+10) at Termessee
Tennessee hasn’t been the same team
since it lost to Florida In the Volunteers’

only game since then, they had a poor per-
formance last week in beating Mississippi.
The Bulldogs are on the opposite road,
climbing in the rankings every week.
They’re No. 13 this week, and with a win
over the No. 9 Volunteers, they’ll ﬁnally
crack the Top 10. Georgia probably has the
better team. The Bulldog offense is much
more balanced than Tennessee’s, and
Georgia quarterback Mike Bobo, though
not nearly as spectacular as Peyton
Manning, has been equally eifective. But
this game is at Neyland Stadium, one of the

toughest places in the country to play.

Termessee should have just enough to win.
Tennessee 28, Georgia 27

This week’s Best Bet:
Air Force (+1) at Navy

The Army-Navy game is always a
highlight of the season. You can talk about
Arrny—Navy all you want, but the best ser-
vice-academy team this season is Air Force,
hands down. And get this: Air Force plays
defense andruns the ball! IntheWAC! That
never happens, which is part of the reason
why the WAC has always been such a bad
conference. They’re easy to overlook, but
don’t be surprised if the Falcons are playing
in an alliance bowl game in January.
Air Force 30, Navy 7

Last week: 5-3 outright; 4-4 vs. point spread
Cumulative season records: 25-13; 19-19;
Best Bet: 5-1

_ throwing heat and waiting for the call to

the majors.

That story is all but a never—to-be
memory of what could have been. Ron
Powlus would have been the top dog at
Pitt from the day he set foot on this cam-
pus.

Instead, he has suffered through
injuries, a ground-oriented Lou Holtz
offense and the ominous pressure of being
the quarterback at arguably the most hal-
lowed athletic institution in the world.

As a football fan, I feel for a guy with
that much talent who falls on hard times.

my deep loathing for the. commercially

saturated Notre Dame program —— I say
screw Powlusand the a1most—lame horse
he rides in on this weekend.

He teased the Panther faithful into
believing he was headed for scenic
Oakland, only to follow his hick roots and
graze in South Bend for ﬁve years.

Why did he do that to us?

Why did he have to bait us into
believing that we could be contenders for
a few years?

Powlus would have made the
Panthers a respectable team simply
through his leadership and knowledge of
the game.

So, as the not—so-Fighting Irish ——~

I hope that Jason Soboleski, a
Berwick teammate of Powlus’, makes
him feel right at home by planting him in
the stadium turf over and over and over.

I hope that long snapper John Parker,
who played in the shadow of Powlus at
Berwick, ﬁnds a way to do something to
the oft-injured tumcoat. Hey, it’s a stretch,
but you never know what can happen.

Pittsburgh sports fan: obnoxious, loud,
drunk and ready to turn to violence at any
moment.

I’m not condoning senseless "acts of
rage against Powlus by any means, but
don’t be afraid to let him have it if the
opportunity presents itself.

When it comes to Powlus and Pitt,
the ‘80’s teenbopper Tiffany said it best:

“Could have been so beautiful ...”

Matt Grove is a columnist for The Pitt
News and thinks Ron Powlus is a candy-
arm hypochondriac who deserves a good
old-fashioned Pittsburgh whooping with
a bottle of Iron City and a tire iron.

h, yeah, and Mr: Grove also is afraid
to make a prediction‘ because of what
happened last week.
