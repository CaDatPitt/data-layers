  request again

By Michael Macagnone

The Pitt News Staff

The Student Government Board
will hear a request tonight from
Pitt’s African Students Organiza-
tion, three weeks after the group
withdrew its request for money
to fund the Wazobia cultural
event. ‘

This time, the African Stu-
dents Organization has provided

' l'l'l0I‘€ documentation fOl.' ltS I'€-

quest and will not include a fund-
ing request for comedian Don’t
Jealous Me, which the group will
likely submit at a later date.

The organization withdrew
the $10,079.14 request for Wa-
zobia at the Jan. '31 SGB meeting
after the Board raised concerns
about documentation for two
parts of the request: supplies the
group intended to purchase from
a thrift store and the fee and trav-
el funding for the comedian.

The group wanted to bring to
campus British comedian Don’t
Jealous Me, who is ‘of Nigerian
descent, alongwith a pair of acro-

bats and three fashion designers.

for different parts of the event.
The group also requested money
for supplies its members wanted
to purchase from thrift stores.
Board members objected ,to
part of the request because of an
email included in the group’s pa-
perwork. The email, sent to Don’t
Jealous Me, had a line blacked
out.‘ But the line was still legible,
Allocations Committee Chair
Michael Nites said. According to
Nites, the email said the group
could not get money for Don’t
Jealous Me’s ﬂight and asked that

because he would have to pay for

ASO’s business ‘ manager,
Inatimi Oguara, later said that
she had blacked out a line in the
email to Don’t Jealous Me. Fund-
ing rules in the Board’s Alloca-
tions Manual do not allow SGB to
fund international ﬂights.

Don’t Jealous Me wrote back
with a new, higher price. The
group’s request on "Jan. 31 did
not include the cost of the inter-
national ﬂight as a separate line
item, but it did include the email
exchange with Don’t Jealous Me.

The email was sent from
the Wazobia planning commit-
tee’s email account, separate
from ASO’s general account.
Both Oguara and ASO President
Onaopemipo Dina declined to
identify the author of the email.

-On the WPTS Campus Round-
table radio show on Feb. 1, Dina
said that six members of the Wa-
zobia planning committee had
access to that email account.
Oguara said that neither she nor
Dina is on the committee, which
is separate from the group’s lead-
ership. — A

Dina and Oguara will not‘iden— V

tee‘, and the committee does not
have a public website or Face-
book page. . '

Board President James Lan-
dreneau, Nites and Dina have
all refused requests to provide a
copy of the email exchange with
the performer, redacted or oth-
erwise.

Chancellor Mark Nordenberg at-
tributed last year’s state budget
cuts to a frantic new state admin-

istration and large budget deﬁcit, p

but he said that the deep proposed

- cuts to Pitt’s funding this year'are

uncalled for. '

b “When we got together in
March, it was fair to say we were
dealing with a new administra-
tion,” he said. But 13 months into
Gov. Tom Corbett’s administra-
tion, Nordenberg isn’t ready to
be as understanding.

On Monday night, Nordenberg
addressed about 150 students and
staff in Alumni Hall on Corbett’s
proposed budget cuts to state-
related schools. He spoke‘ for

45 minutes about the cuts and
what students can do to get the
state legislature to hear students’
voices. »

At the beginning of February,
Corbett proposed a 30 percent
cut to Pitt’s budget, which would
bringnext year’s state funding
from $136 million down to $95.2
million. Last year, Corbett origi-
nally proposed a 50 percent cut to
the four state—related schools, but
the state legislature passed the
budget in June with a 19 percent
cut in state appropriations.

Nordenberg suggested that the
new administration rushed delib-
eration on these evaluative deci-
sions, making Pitt an “accidental
target” of reduced funding.

Nordenberg then praised the
efforts of the Pitt community in
its advocacy following Corbett’s.

. Nordenberg encourages student action on budget

ﬁrstbudget proposal.

“We immediately mobilized
and were able to blunt some of
what had been proposed,” he said.
“We need all of those efforts again
this year.”

To get students involved,
the Student Government Board
is sponsoring a two-day letter-
writing campaign Tuesday and
Wednesday, which will be held in
the Kurtzman Room of the Wil-
liam Pitt Union from 9 a.m. to 3
p.m. Students will be able to write
letters to their state legislators
asking them to reduce the cuts
to Pitt’s state funding.

Additionally, Pitt Day in Har-
risburg will be held on March 13,
with registration opening March
1. Nordenberg said about 500

withdrew it to make revisions.

Landreneau later attributed the prob-
lems with the request to a miscommunica-
tion between the group and the Board, as
well as problems with the documentation
of other portions of the group’s request.

“There was a lot of confusion over what
paperwork to turn in, and we did not have
all of the documentation,” he said.

Oguara said that the group will not re-
quest ﬁmding for Don’t Jealous Me’s travel
when it submits its paperwork in the fu-
ture. Instead, she said that the group will
raise funds to ﬂy the comedian to Pitts-
burgh. ”

When the Board hears the request to-
night, it will be much smaller than the
$10,079.14 amount of three weeks ago. The
submission will not include the request for
money for thecomedian, which the group
will likely submit in the near future.

The group requested $3,750 to pay for
an acrobat team and three designers at last
Thursday’s Allocations Committee meet-
ing. Nites ‘said the committee approved
$1,250 for the three designers and de-
nied $2,500 for the acrobats because the
committee couldn’t justify spending that
much money on a 20- to 30-minute per-
formance. - ' -

The committee also approved $535.60
for airfare and $866.16 for lodging for two

designers,'$292.80 for security for the
event and $615.86 for supplies and deco-
rations. The committee denied $100 for
ground transportation for two designers
because of a lack of documentation.

The changing request

African Students Organization origi-
nally submitted a funding request for
the event on Jan. 11 and withdrew it after
speaking with the Allocations Committee.

Oguarasaid that the Allocations Com-_
mittee did not bring up the international
ﬂight as an issue ‘in the original request.
The committee asked the group to provide
more documentation for the acrobats’ and
the comedian’s contracts. Oguara also said
that the group needed to provide more in-
formation to the Allocations Committee
about the items the group intended to pur-
chase from thrift stores.

Landreneau said that the Jan. 11’ request
included $732for international airfare for
the comedian, which was not included in
the Jan. 26 request. _

The Jan. 11 request did not differentiate
between who would be paid how much in

order to come to campus, but Landreneau V

said the group originally requested
$5,696.28 to pay for the performers and

designers. ASO requested $7,350 to pay for 1

the performers and designers onjan. 26 in
arequest that did not include the $732 in-
ternational ﬂight line item. ’
After the group withdrew the Jan. 11
request, Oguara said that she talked with a
number of people about how best to docu-

ment the request, including Board mem-

ber Halim Genus.

Oguara said Genus ﬁrst brought up the
issue of travel for the comedian, whose
international travel was included as a line
item in the group’s initial request. When
Genus and the group brought the issue to
Nites’ attention, he said that the Board
could not fund international travel.

Genus said he advised members of the
group that they should contact the come-

‘ dian, tell him that they could not fund his
ﬂight, and ask that the comedian “adjust

his honorarium accordingly.”

Genus said he “did not see anything
wrong with that.” a

After that, someone from the Wazo-
bia planning committee sent the email to
Don’t_Iealous Me.

Nites and Dina said that Oguara printed
a copy of the email in the Allocations of-
ﬁce when she submitted the request, and
Oguara was advised there to black out the
line; Oguera conﬁrmed that she was asked
to black out the line, but would not say by
whom. ,

Oguara said that members of the A110-
cations Committee brought up the email
documentation at the committee’s Jan.
26 meeting, along with the -issues about
documentation for the group’s supply pur-
chases. ‘ ‘ A

“They did bring up the issue. They said

that they-have to reduce the honorarium ‘

because we cannot include international
travel in the honorarium,” she said.

Ryan Gayman, the Allocations Commit—_ A

 

tee liaison for the African Students Orga- V

nization, confirmed that he sent an email
to Oguara onjan. 27 after the group’s meet-
ing with Allocations the night before, pro-
viding information about the committee’s
decision for the group’s request.

The email said the Allocations Com-
mittee chose to deny in full the costs of
the honorarium, transportation and lodg-
ing for the performer Don’t]ea1ous Me
because of “false information” the group
provided. ’

The email also said the committee
chose to fund in ﬁlll the costs associated
with the designers for the event, because
the committee members felt the designers

and fashion were the main component of g

the event. O

Gayman declined to comment further.

Oguara said that Gayman was not in the
room at the Jan, 26 Allocations Committee
meeting when the committee went over the
request. »

Dina said that she had spoken to Oguara
before the Jan. 31 SGB meeting about the
email exchange with Don’t Jealous Me and
saw an unaltered version of that exchange
on Jan. 30. Dina said that she focused on
the .reasons for funding various parts of
Wazobia when preparing to speak before
the Board at thejan. 31 meeting.

International travel

The controversy’ of the request centers
on an Allocations Manual rule that pro-
hibits funding for international travel. But
that rule does not keep a group from po-
tentially funding travel anyway by having a
performer’s or speaker’s honorarium, the
fee for the person’s time at a performance
or event, cover the travel.

The issue arises from what Director of
Student Life Kenyon Bonner called a “gray
area” in the Student Government Board’s
rules manual about international travel.
Bonner said that the rule about interna-

- tional travel stems from the frequently

high cost of ﬂights from outside the conti-
nental United States.

Bonner said that decision-making con— -

cerning that gray area falls on the Board
itself. That decision is related-to a large
body of unwritten rules separate from
the Allocations Manual, and referred to as
precedents that the Board uses to govern
its actions. Some of -these rules include
limits on conference funding amounts and
tournament funding for club A teams but
not B teams. . ,
Landreneau said that, as far as he
knows, no ‘group hasreceived funding for

‘ international travel by including it in a vis-

itor’s fee while he has been on the Board,
but he also said that it would be difﬁcult to
tell if such an allowance was made with-
out SGB’s‘ knowledge. He said that while
groups may have speakers or performers
come from outside the country, their fees
can onlypay for .the value of the time they
spend performing or speaking.

Board member Julie Hallinan said that
there is a certain level of support Board
members should provide to groups for Al-
locations requests. Shealso said that since
Genus was on the Allocations Committee
before becoming a1Board member, it made
sense that he was helping the group with
its request. S '

“But there’s a certain line you need
to know if what you’re doing is right or
wrong,” Hallinan said.

She said that when the Board gets fund-
ing requests for honorariums, it is possible
that money for international ﬂights are
hidden in those costs and it “slips through
the cracks.”

“But this was such an obvious thing that "

they put in the honorarium,” she said. I

SGB must keep written  
record of rules, precedents

The Student Government Board
is all overthe news this month.
From its handling of Alter-
native Break and the African
Student Organization’s alloca-
'tions, we’ve noticed that the
Board members aren’t always
consistent in their rulings.

Last week, the Board—de_nied‘

the Women’s Fast-Pitch Softball
Club’s and the,men’s baseball
club’s requests for funding for
competitions in Florida over

Spring Break. Despite the fact .

that the two sports teams had
received funding for the same
events for the past two years, the
Board maintained a precedent
set the week before that prevents
funding of trips that conﬂict with
the University—sponsored Alter-
native Break. ' I
. The situation involves confu-
sion because the Board operates

p based on a number of precedents

— earlier actions that serve as
examples or guides for future
reference —— that are constantly
in ﬂux and not recorded. A A

This becomes a game of
Calvinball, a sport introduced in
the old Calvin and Hobbes comic
that consists simply of making
up the rules as you go along.

This does n’t just cause prob-
lems with communication. Since
precedents can b_e altered at any
time, all power is theoretically
deferred to Presidentjames Lan-
dreneau and his Board, which
can overrule_,the Allocations
Manual. 1 '

SGB offers Allocations 101,,

a program designed to inform
student groups about the alloca-

clear that the Board itself isn’.t

even on the same page when

it comes to its previous prec-
edents, something like Alloca-
tions 101 conceals the root of
the problem. ~ A .

We don’t think the Board can
criticize student groups for not
knowing the allocations process
-—— or even educate them, for that
matter ‘—- until it documents

In politics, it’s often attractiveto draw crisp,
straight lines through issues muddled with gray
areas. But whatever emotions wielding the mighty
sword of simplicity might evoke, policymakers
who ignore the subtleties in their environments
do so dangerously, both forthemselves and, more
importantly, for citizens.

Herman Cain tried it in July, when, annoyed
by the complex nature of the U.S. tax system, he
trumpeted the seductively
simple 999 tax plan. Now
after the implosion of
his colorful presiden-
tial candidacy, it ap-
pears Cain just didn’t
devote the time and
focus to appreciate
what damage 999
would -do not only
to middle-income ‘ rs»
families, but also to
the viability of federal
revenues. Trying to
decorate himself with
gray-area-cutting ac-
colades, Cain looked
like an ignorant fool
in the end, his blind
ambition poised to
hurt millions of aver-
age Americans.

' from and avoided by people in power,

particularly Pitt’s" Student Government Board.

Over the past two weeks, the SGB has turned
away" three student organizations that attended
Tuesday Board meetings to request funding for
trips during Spring Break. On Feb. 7, Board Presi-
dent James Landreneau discouraged Panther
Parkour club from ofﬁcially requesting $1,966 to
fund a trip to Washington, and last week the Board
denied outright requests by the Women’s Fast-
Pitch Softball Club and the men’s club baseball
team for money to attend competitions in Florida
($4,655.29 and $9,019.75, respectively).

The justiﬁcation for these funding denials goes
as follows: In contrast to the decisions of previous

Boards, the 2012 Board will not fund out—of—state ‘

trips — especiallyclub. sports practices — that
conﬂict with the Alternative Break program, as

is stated in the 2012 SGB Allocations Manual-—.?pIn V
. addition, “Practicing over Spring Break is seen‘ as

a vacation paid for by SGB,” Landreneau said in a

if  phone? interview. .
This"Sp_ring Break funding policy is ﬂawed, and '

Board members had better acknowledge it.
Granted, the Spring Break funding policy could
be described as an admirable effort on the part

of the'SG_B —— Board members are trying .toIr'save—",-,

students’ money for what they believe to be more

legitimate uses. At ﬁrst glance, that’s good govern’.-I  _

 

Illustration by Mike Rosenthal I

  SB’s hlanket ban burns Spring Break goers

ment doing good work. But when you look closer,
it’s clear that the Board has dangerously applied
a one-size-ﬁts—all rule — with similarly problem-
atic one-size—ﬁts-all understanding — to Spring
Break funding requests, dismissing the inevitable
gray area to the potential detriment of students.
Remember, the wording of the Allocations Manual
is not holy or immutable, and in this case it deﬁ-
nitely shouldn’t be. p C
The SGB must be careful about how much it

‘ pushes Student Affairs programs it doesn’t con-

trol. Sure, Pitt’s involving students in service proj-
ects gives us one reason to admire this University.
" I Accordingly, someone
ought to promote stu-

dent‘ awareness of
and participation
in Alternative
Break. And if

the SGB de-
cides to join

the promo-
tion, that’s

tivities.

Why? Because the idea

 

‘that any particular type of .

trip —— for club sports, service or really anything
—— constitutes direct competition with Alterna-
tive Break under all circumstances, and therefore
cannot be funded, is silly. Student organizations
are capablelof coming up with ways to spend their
time that are: 1) legitimate, and 2) nothing like-the
experience offered by Alternative Break. The SGB
should respect these ways in which student orga-
nizations choose to use their time and energies; it
should not instead hold a University-sponsored
Spring Break activity above all possible student-
generated activities. Furthermore, there is no evi-
dence that SGB’s funding Spring Break activities in
past years somehow deprived Alternative Break of

participants, and nor should there be: Can you re-

ally call baseball competitions in Florida and trail
restoration in Tennessee close substitutes for the

typical individual? If you can, you’re probably a

politician. , .

It should be noted that part of President Lan-
dreneau’s justiﬁcation has merit: Allocations re-

real risk, but, once again, the Board prescribes a

To the Editor,

In his column “Contraception man-
date unfair,” Mark Kozlowski makes
several vast — and specious — logi-
cal leaps. First, and most offensively,
he compares federal funding of birth
control to federal funding of programs
to cure homosexuality. He. argues that
both are of similar validity due to their
supporters’ “passionately fel ” beliefs.
Of course, reparative therapy’ has been
demonstrated over and over to be
abusive and ineffective. More impor-
tantly, the comparison doesn’t work
because reparative therapy has no

medical value, whereas birth control
does. Those who cannot safely carry a
pregnancy to term and those who suf-
fer from ovarian cysts, dysmenorrhea
and endometriosis do not take birth
control as a convenience. I do not wish
to imply that these applications are
more valid than birth control’s stated
purpose, but they were largely absent
from the author’s argument. ' '
I cannot help but ﬁnd these real
and present health risks more com-
pelling than a theoretical lack of phar-
maceutical competition. The ﬁnan-
cial argument presented here — that
“someone” will still have to shoulder

these costs —— can only be made by
someone with a minimal grasp of
how, exactly, insurance works.
Finally, I take issue with the clos—_
ing shot that “this mandate  sets a
dangerous precedent by which other
beliefs can just as easily be attacked.”
As a religious person, I support reli-

- gious freedom, but I question priori-

tizing it over women’s health —— un-
less women’s health is not, in fact, a
priority. If that’s the case, please do
us the dignity of justsaying so.

banning Spring Break funding across the board serves
the responsible and irresponsible clubs the same pun-
ishment, the policy resembles swatting a ﬂy with a shot-
gun — you eliminate your problem all right, as long as
you don’t care about what else you’ve eliminated.

“This is something we have to look at in extreme de-
tail,” Landreneau said in a phone interview, referring to
the Spring-Break funding issue. He’s right. I just hope
his Board pays attention to the uniqueness of such “de—
tails” that each allocations request presents, as opposed
to applying the same exclusionary rule to everyone. It’s
time to.put the gray into student government.Q .

GLUTEN-FREE, ME?

Staff Writer

Two weeks ago, I ﬁled for divorce
with Pitt’s Dining Services.
Market Central will accom-
modate food allergies without
additional charge, but I found
that I just wanted more options
than were available in the dining
hall. Gluten is a difﬁcult allergy

‘to have because it is‘in so many

foods, and while I’m a little dis-
tressed at the idea of not being
able to use the campus dining
facilities, I know that for my own
personal health, it would be best
to be without a meal plan.

In the meantime, I’ve been
looking around for other options
around Pittsburgh. Since my in-
tolerance was diagnosed in No-
vember, I have found many glu-
ten-free cuisine choices around
the city and some helpful hints
for eating out.‘

If you love noodles but have to shun wheat
due to an intolerance for gluten, don ’t 
despair. Visit your local Asian grocer.

Uodles of gluten-free noodles 0

~ Rice noodles, a staple of southeast
Asian cuisines, are available in a wide
variety of shapes and thickness;
Vietnamese pho (a soup) is one
well-known rice noodle dish

~ Mung bean noodles, also known
as cellophane noodles, vermicelli and
“see-through” noodles, pair well with
any recipe that uses soy sauce

Some restaurants make it a point to ca-
ter to gluten-intolerant customers, but not
all restaurants have separate menus.

Navigating a normal menu can be diffi-
cult, but it’s always better to ask than to or-
der blindly. For instance, if a burger place

' uses all beef — so, no ﬁllers that might
contain gluten — you can ask to substitute
lettuce for the bun. And although gluten is
in many foods, even just in small—quanti—
ties, there are usually ingredient substitu-
tions you can request. For example, corn-
starch can be used instead of ﬂour in many
recipes, and rice noodles can substitute for
regular noodles.

Gluten allergies and intolerances are
more common in recent years, and those in

Get soft, shiny hair with
things in your kitchen

 'Ifyou’re like me, this winter’s cold, wind "

and reactionary indoor heat has your hair

_ feeling like its made of dried—out husks.

Hats, heat and icy‘ conditions — this
season is practically made to dry out your
coiffure. But with a little extra mainte-
nance,~those locks can be shiny and soft
again. Here are a few different hair.masks
you can whip up to restore your strands
to their run—your-ﬁngers—through-them
glory, made out of ingredients you have ly-
ing around.

Milk-and-Honey Mask '

- 1 teaspoon honey
- 1 cup milk

The easiest one of the bunch‘ —'— just
mix the two ingredients together and work
through hair. Leave the treatment-in for 15
minutes, and then wash it out with warm
—— but not hot —_— water and a mild sham-
poo.

Strawberry Mask
- 2 to 3 hulled strawberries
- 1 egg yolk ,

>.

Photos by Jarrett ewart

- 2 tablespoons olive oil

.Blend the ingredients together until the
mix looks like a thick juice ——7 no strawber-
ry chunks. Work the mixture into your hair

V and let itsit for 20 minutes, then wash it

out with shampoo.

Banana Smoothie Mask

- 1 mashed banana

‘ 1 egg

- 3 tablespoons honey

- 3 tablespoons milk . ‘
- 5 tablespoons ‘olive oil

In ablender, mix together all ingredi-
ents. When they’re combined, apply the
concoction to your hair. After 15 to 30 min-
utes, depending on how thick your hair is,
wash the mask out with warm water and a
mild shampoo. ’ '

A quick note: I like to wrap my hair in
an old T-shirt" or towel while I wait, but a
shower cap will workjﬁne. I’ve even heard
of people who wrap their head in Saran
Wrap.

HAIR

FROM PAGE 8

Regardless of where you go, after you
get the right cut, you need to start thinking
about styling techniques. Ask your stylist
what he or she thinks your routine should
be, but take the advice with a grain of salt
and explore other options yourself. It’s
your hair; you need to ﬁnd out what works
for you. '

One of the biggest things to consider is
how you wash your hair. Many stylists will
tell you that once you wash your hair, you
don’t have to touch it for another week.
Others will tell you to wash it but avoid
shampoo. ‘ ' I

The belief is that shampoo contains
sulfates (the ingredients that makes sham-
poos sudsy) which are damaging to wavy
hair. Some women have given up on sham-
poo entirely, calling their effort the “no

‘poo”’ movement.

Going shampoo—free can be frustraté .

ing though, because after a couple of days,
your hair looks  well, awful. This is es-
pecially true during the summer or if you
exercise frequently. Sweaty hair just needs

._to be washed. I’ve never been able to make
it more than a week without cracking, but .

some women swear by it. It can take a while
for your hair to adjust, but ify‘ou’re,willing
to stick it out, your hair will be all the. more
healthy. I    I 
I think that ﬁnding the rig 'Tl)ia.la:Il_lCe
is key. I usually only shampoo  other

day, and I try to use a sulfate-;fir.eéZ.prliduct. V

My mother only shampoojswb _ week,

but wets her hair daily. Som‘;

   

 

:in a shower cap or old T—shirt before get-

ting into the shower. Kristin Ess of the-
beautydepartment.com has a great list of
hair regimens for you to try.

I also recommend investing in a dry
shampoo for dayslwhen your hair gets too
greasy. This is especially true if, like me,
you have bangs, which tend to look greas-
ier than the rest of your hair. I’m currently
using Pssssst! for wavy or curly hair by
Freeman, but Suave recently came out with
a line of dry shampoos that look promis-
ing. Baby powder also works to hide grease
if you just sprinkle a little on your roots.

‘ Next, invest in some curling products
to make styling easier. Massey came out
with a highly recommended line of prod-
ucts called DevaCurl. I also swear by Mo-
roccanOil’s curl deﬁning cream. However,

_ these can both be a little pricey, so look for

curling creams at the drugstore. Garnier
Fructis’_Wonder Waves mousse is a good

, product that will suit your budget.

You should also look for a good serum
to tame frizz, the number one enemy of
curly girls the world over. ,

Once you have a head full of natural
waves, it’s time to decide how to style them.
While I love to leave my hair down, there
are a lot of chic updos to try. And since
most updos require that you curl your hair
beforehand for better hold, you’re already
one step ahead. . I

For those days whenlyour hair just isn’t
lying right, it’s okay to cheat by tweaking
sections with a small curling iron. Just be
sure to put it on the lowest heat setting to
avoid damage. -

The overall idea is to enjoy your natural
texture, regardless of whether it’s curly or
wavy, thick or thin. I

GLUTEN

FROM PAGE 7

the food industry aren’t blind to this fact.
Most restaurants will cater to your dietary
needs, but there is a surprising amount of
food that is naturally gluten—free — so get
informed before dining out.

Another option for fast eating is pre-
prepared supermarket foods.

If you travel down Centre Avenue you
will come across Whole Foods. This gro-
cery chain marks items that are gluten-free
with little green ﬂags, so they are easily vis-
ible to the aisle peruser. Its prepared-foods
section and bakery alsolabel allergens.

But even with these options, I still felt
restricted when I‘ was eating outside of
restaurants, as most packaged gluten-free
foods rarely have the taste and texture of
the foods they try to imitate. So, at the end
oﬁianuary, I'trave1édta MOnroejville.for the

Celiac Awareness;Touiﬁ;_hoping'vtovdiscoverg~  ' 

new options and food ch‘oice's.

I found myself smackpin the middle of
a gluten—free heaven. All the things I had‘
been craving were in a single spot: dough-
nuts, pizza, soft pretzels, even pierogies.
Thingsl thought I would "never eat-again
were all here. All of the food was stationed
in one large ballroom containing about 20
vendors. Stand after stand was stocked
with safe samples, providing a diverse
feast ﬁt for a gluten—free king. E

Although they weren’t exact matches
for the tastes and textures of the foods

I’d been craving, the featured foods were
much closer to the originals than what I’d

c

been eating.

February 21, 2012 1 The Pitt News I vv\/wv.pitinevvs.cerri

From trial and error, I can tell you that
most gluten—free substitutes are subpar at
best, and usually I‘ end up disappointed
with my food purchases. The foods at the
Celiac Awareness Tour were different. It
was evident that people who missed and
craved these foods were the ones mak-

QRAIN OF SAUL

By Isaac Saul
Assistant Sports Editor

Three players in the NBA put on
historic performances Sunday
night, and none of them were
Jeremy Lin.

In a show that might never

again be repeated in NBA history, .

Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook
and Serge Ibaka of the Oklahoma
City Thunder made the “Big
Three” of the Miami Heat look
like Division II benchwarmers.
Together, in a victory over
the Denver Nuggets, Durant
and Westbrook combined for
91 points. That’s more than the
Celtics, Pistons, Raptors, Hornets
and Bobcats average per game.
Durant scored a career—high
51 points, and it only took him
28 shots to do it. He hit his ﬁrst
ﬁve 3-pointers. It was the ﬁrst
time two teammates each scored

< I340 points in a game since Scottie

‘Th

{Jug

Pippen and Michael Jordan did it
on Feb. 18, 1996.

If you think these two players
were just hogging the ball in
a blowout, think again: They
only had two points from their
teammates in the ﬁnal 12:40
of basketball. In that time, the
Thunder managed to go from

SPORTS
“Don’t forget about Durant, Thunder

being down seven to winning
by six. Together, Durant and
Westbrook scored 34 of their
team’s ﬁnal 36 points.

Durant — who is third in
the league in scoring with 27.1
points per game — continued
the dominance that we’ve _seen
since he entered the league. His
51 points could easily have been
70, considering the forward shot
over 67 percent in the game.

Westbrook’s unusual outburst
of points also came with nine
assists and two turnovers, apretty
incredible statline for a young,
up-and—coming point guard.

So, how does Ibaka ﬁt into
this equation? Well, he tallied a
triple-double on Sunday, making

~ the Thunder’s trio the ﬁrst three

players in the NBA’s 65-year
history to combine two 40-point
scorers with a triple-double.

Not only that, but Ibaka got the

triple-double with 15 points, 14,

rebounds and 11 blocks, making
him the ﬁrst player in franchise
history to record a triple-double
with blocks as one of his double-
digit ﬁgures. _ _

Only 16 players have recorded
a triple-double with blocks since
1986 (and theirs include names
like Shaquille O’Neal, David
Robinson, Dikembe Mutombo,

" come around, consider this:

and Hakeem Olajuwon), and
Ibaka did it on a night on which
two, of his teammates combined
for 91 points. .
The best part about Oklahoma
City pulling out the 124-118
overtime victory against the
Nuggets was the reminder that

these small—market teams can be

a'for_ce.
Oklahoma City has just more

than a half million people living
within its city limits.» Compa're'd‘

to the eight million of New
York City, that number seems
miniscule. Yet who was on the
home page of every major sports
outlet that covers‘ basketball
on Monday morning? It wasn’t
Lebron James, it wasn’t the New
York Knicks and _ Jeremy Lin,
but it was Kevin Durant and ‘the

' ‘Oklahoma City Thunder. -
And if you think the Thunder 
might just fade into the j

background as NBA playoffs

At 24-7, the team V,  .-  i

MEN'S BASKETBALL

Panthers try to im

By Eric Burrage
Staﬁ Writer

Two weeks ago, the Pitt men’s
basketball team rode a four-
game winning streak into Tampa,
Fla., for a matchup against the
University of South Florida. The
game resulted in a 63-51 loss.
On Sunday, the Panthers lost to
the same South Florida team,
but (this time it was their fourth
consecutive loss..

The Panthers’ two most
recent outings have been home
losses against West Virginia and
South Florida — both precise
demonstrations of _ the team’s
struggle -to ﬁnd the‘ offensive

December.
The Panthers suffered a 66-48

loss against West Virginia in the '

last scheduled Backyard Brawl
- a game that faces an uncertain
future with West Virginia set
to join the Big 12 next season.
In the loss, the Panthers gave
up 23 points on 17 turnovers,
a statistic that proved to be
insurmountable.

Following the game, West
Virginia coach Bob Huggins said
that his team came in with a
different defensive strategy than
in its previous matchup. with

Pitt. The revised defense likely. V

contributed to the " high number

of turnovers committed by the
Panthers, ‘he said. ‘
“We told »our_ guys‘ to extend

[the passing lanes] more to see_
if we couldn’t make them a little 5
more uncomfortable handling‘
the ball,” Huggins said.j“We also ..
tried running a lit”tle.more_.zone :
_ defense tonight, which got better‘

over the course of the game.”
Pitt guard Travon Woodall

acknowledged the diﬂiculty his
‘ team had with the Mountaineers’

defense. “They were denying

1 every pass, and we weren’t doing

a good job of getting open,”

VWoodall said. “They had nine

steals, iand. they turned our

._turnov_ers',i_r_1to baskets. That was
-A ‘ deﬁnitely the key.”

Pitt 1 struggled ‘ with handling
the ball for most of the game, but

half. Still, the Panthers went into

second half as Pitt’s shooting

‘dropped to just 29 percent.

Woodall shouldered much of the
blame for his team’s offensive
struggles in the game, shooting
just 5 of 16 from the ﬂoor, in
addition to his four turnovers.
“Once again, I didn’t control
the ball, and I put that on mysel ,”
Woodall _said. “We got a bunch
of open looks that we normally

, knock down, but for some reason

we didn’t tonight.”

Ashton Gibbs, Pitt’s' other
starting guard and - season.
scoring leader, followed the poor
shooting trend, ﬁnishing just
2-11 from the ﬂoor. Woodall and
Gibbs’ struggles highlight the
importance of Pitt’s guard play
in winning games. As 'the team’s
ﬂoor leaders and primary ball
handlers, they have much of the
team’s success riding on their
nightly performances.

When the teams met in
Morgantown at the end of
January, Gibbs and Woodall

combined for 39 points on 12-20 .

Panthers try to avoid

anotherhistoric loss

Byjasper Wilson I _
Staﬁ Writer A '

The last ‘time the women’s basketball
team played a top 10 opponent, it lost by a
historic 76 pointsto Notre Dame. 4

This time, the Panthers hope to avoid a
repeat when they. face No. 4 University of
Connecticut Tuesday night.

If th'e‘team’s losing streak; currently at 1

12, _continues, it will be the worst streak
under _Agnus. Berenato during, her nine
season$,_at Pitt.

UConn’{(,24—3 overall, .11.-2 Big East),
a perennial-E--power in lwo__rne_n’s, college
basketball, made some history of its own
recently. When the Huskies lost 57-56 to
St. John’s on Saturday, the longest home
winning streak in women’s NCAA history
ended at 99 games. It~was also the ﬁrst time
UConn had lost to an unranked opponent
in 19 years. .

The -Panthers (8-18 overall, 0-13 Big
East), who are comingoif a 62-50 loss at
the hands of South Florida, seemed to have
lost the inside—outside offensive balance

that played a crucial role in creating close g

games against Cincinnati and Louisville.
Leeza Burdgess led Pitt post players

with nine points against South Florida, but i.
forwards Kyra Dunn and TiAnna Porter,

had only four and three, respectively.
Pitt needs that balance to have a chance
on Tuesday. ‘
“We have to get more points from our
four position,” Berenato said. ’
With the posts struggling offensively,
the guards need to pick up the slack.
“Collectively, our. guards have to ‘score
more. Our guards only shot 30 percent

it [against South Florida],’’ Berenato said.

“You got to do better than that.” _

The game has the potential to turn ugly
quickly as it pits the league’s worst defense
against the best defense and second—best
offense. ~ 1

- And considering that UConn is already
‘coming off of a shock defeat, another upset
bid appears unlikely. A

“UConn is going to come out trying to
get a win and not underestimate anybody,”
Burdgess said.

That said, the Huskies’ loss to’ St. Johns
did humanize the seemingly indefatigable
juggernaut. ’ -

Burgess said it made the team believe
that it can compete.

UConn players freshman Kiah Stokes
and sophomore Stefanie Dolson were
dumbfounded by the loss.

“It’s hard to get that through my head
that we actually just lost,” Stokes said
in a “press release on UConn’s website.

“It was like we didn’t even care,” Dolson
added. '

Slaeilticm Sat:-r1.~:tein_ 5

The ‘chances that the Huskies will be as
dazed and confused against Pitt are slim,
said senior Tiffany Charles, because the
loss will only improve the team.

“We need to focus,” Charles said in a
press release on UConn’s website. “Coach
said a loss is probably good for us because

we were making mistakes in other games

. . . I think it will make us focus
‘even more.”

The Panthers average nearly
20 turnovers a game — a stat
that has no reason to be so high,
Berenato said.

“We have to cut down on the

Lturnovers. They don’t need to
happen,” she said.

Berenato was quick to dispel
any notion of Pitt sneaking up
and surprising UConn.

“I don’t that Connecticut ever
goes into a game thinking that
they have it in hand. They are elite
competitors, and competitors do
not ever look past an opponent,”
she said.

Burdgess agreed.

“UConn is not the team that.

:..is going to go on a losing spree,”
she said. “UConn is gonna come
out trying to get a win and not
underestimate anybody.”

Redshirt sophomore Ashlee
Anderson could be the catalyst
for Pitt’s offensive success, as
long as» she stays combative.

“I deﬁnitely have gotten more
aggressive . . . I’m becoming
more conﬁdent with my offense
so that’s helping me defensively,”

production needs to be high.

“[Against South Florida] we
made the turnovers, but we made
sure the next possession we got a
stop, or the next possession we
got a score,” Anderson said.'“We
can’t turn the ball over without
scoring or getting a defensive
stop.” ~

Burdgess says the interior
players have to rebound on the
offensive end to give the Panthers
a chance.

“We have to get every offensive
rebound to get us more chances,”
she said. “We still struggle with
turning over the ball, so in order
to lengthen ‘our possessions,
we just need to get [those]
rebounds.”

Asked about the rest of the
season, Berenato’s attention was
concentrated on the short term.

_“I’m focusing on getting the
ball inbounds,” she said.

Even though the opponent is so
highly regarded, Pitt’s approach
to this game is the same as it’s
been for all of conference play.

“We’re coming out ready to
play a very competitive game and
trying to get our first Big East
win,” Burdgess said. I

shooting and helped keep the turnovers to just 10,
which boosted the team to a 72-66 victory. But on
Thursday night, the opposite occurred —— and the
ﬁnal score reflected that.

In Sunday’s loss to South Florida, Pitt’s
offensive woes continued. The team showed
statistical improvement from the West Virginia
game in terms of turnovers, giving the ball up

' just nine times, but several turnovers down the
stretch closed the door on the team’s chance for
a late comeback. ‘

Y Pitt’s shooting struggles from the second half
of the West Virginia game carried, over to the
game against‘USF. The Panthers were plagued
by subpar shooting performances for the whole
game, ﬁnishing 18 of 52 from the ﬂoor, connecting
on a mere 35 percent of their attempts. A

' Sophomore forward ].J. Moore was the only
Panther to reach double digits in scoring for
the game, hitting a career high of 21. Gibbs and
Woodall combined for just four points on 2-11
shooting. A ~ . ‘ * i

The Panthers now have a week off before
they face off against Louisville in what should be ’
another tough matchup on the ‘road. The Cardinals
are 21-6 on the year and are vying for a top ﬁve
position in Big East conference standings.

Pitt will need to address its offensive troubles
in the next seven days“ if it expects to put a halt
to the four-game’ skid. Head coach Jamie Dixon
understands the value of downtime when it comes
to making adjustments and improving.
