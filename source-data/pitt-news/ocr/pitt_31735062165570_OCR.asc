There _are over 140 students -in"

the School of Lib. ‘Sci., represent-
ing over 70 undergraduate schools.
Their course of study leads to a
degree in Library Science which
they receive after two and a half
trimesters.

Students Qualiﬁed

With this degree, the students
are qualiﬁed toserve in any li-
brary they choose. Many go on to
do further work in certain special
areas prior to assuming a formal

SG?HPresiden..t
‘Administrating’
By Josey GROSSMAN

Some people think Student
Government president. Tom
Olofson is a- radical.

“I may be called an extre-
mist,” Olofson declares, “but
a student body‘ government

can't accomplish anything/with-.
out conﬁdence in its equal im-

portance with the faculty and ad-
ministration in certain areas. Nor

can the student government be‘

effective if it doesn’t accept its
responsibilities and strive for the
highest possible goals.”

These two philosophies—the
realization that students, faculty,
and administration compose equal

constituent groups in the Univer-
sity and this striving for excel-
lence——-are the foundation of Olof-
son’s personal and administrative
thinking.
Culture Emphasizes "

The American culture empha-
sizes the leader'-follower relation-
ship, Olofson feels, “but this is
totally inaccurate‘ here. Each of
these three bodies——student, fac-
ulty, and administrative-—are of
equal importance, and each con-
tributes in a different way to the
total University. .If there is a
weak -student government, the
whole University suffers.”

Olofson attributes‘ weak stu- ,

- dent government and individual
student apathy to a misconcep-
tion of this role. “Either; the
students don’t realize that they
have this responsibility to the
school or they don’t care to
take on this responsible role.”
‘This applies to.Olofson’s em-'

phasis on excellence. People set

their objectives too low, he, def-.
clares, and they are satisﬁed with
mediocre results. The only way
to accomplish anything is to fol-

low the thinking of Robert Brown— .

ing, Olofson proposes: “A.man’s

-reach must exceed his grasp.” “

‘Optimum Goals’

"People must set
goals,” Olofson states, ‘.‘and they
_must make a concerted effort to
reach them. But’ even maximum
effort is never satisfactory.
There is always more to do.” _

Student [governments of the
past few years have “epitomized
this total apathy, inefficiency,
and irresponsibility,” according
to Olofson. 4 l

dent government to develop this
year, but one that develops _so far,

so fast, that it will be the ﬁnest,

the University has ever had. This
is what I'm shooting for.”
Organization ‘Showed
“The new organization showed

good intention and effort but the
structure of SG is trivial in com-
parison‘ with what was ‘needed
tochange it. This was the work-
ing people.” "

In fact, Olofson, declares, this
new structure must change.
“Their decisions were based on
the experience of inefficient
government. These details are
becoming‘ antiquated already
and are boging down operation..
We must change our decisions
as the atmosphere changes.“

One burden is the provision re-

quiring that chairmen of execu-
tive-wing projects be taken from
outside the senate.
Original Thinking

The original thinking here,

Olofson explained, was that sen-

ators concentrate in one area;
that they would not be able to
represent a broad area. “There
is no relevance between a. sen-

‘ ator doing a good job and whether

or not he can participate in spe-
cifics,” Olofson commented.

“I like this SG because it's ag-
gressive, conﬁdent, and decisive,”
Olofson concluded. “All American
college students could use a little
more’ of these. If you don’t,put
things across.strongly, youfre go-
ing to lose out.” \‘

help give students faster and
more accurate service, according
to Katheryne Y. Mallino, ﬁrst
assistant in circulation.

From nowion students will be
asked to take a number from the
counter and mark it in the upper
left hand corner of the slip be-
fore presenting the call slips at
the circulation desk. Students will
be waited on in numerical order.

The number must be presented
at the desk in order to claim li-

, Letters to the Editor

Action In Cuban Crisis

Student Defends U.S.

" Editor, The Pitt News
7 ~ 2-.I am writing this letter in re-

ply to a letter printed in The
Pitt News on Monday, Oct. 5. I

ifﬁam doing so in the hope that
L’ I can better inform its author,

Mr. Roger Harm, and others
who feel as he does, ‘of the real

‘. facts concerning Cuban-U.S. re-

lations.

Mr. Harm wrote: “Peace will
be assured in the Carribean
(SIC) only when _the United

it ‘ States assures Cuba that it has

no aggressive intentions toward

 her government, and when some

relations with
is re~estab-

form of normal
that government
lished."

The fallacy of this statement
is ‘easily’ recognizable. When Fi-

, ‘,.de1 Castro was waging his rev-
: olution in the cause of freedom
~ the sentiments of all Americans‘

were behind him. When‘ he suc-
ceeded in his revolution the
U.S.- was the first country in the
world to oﬁicially recognize his
regime and offer it aid.

Then Dr. Castro was our
friend and he remained friendly
until he made his position as
dictator ﬁrm. I-le then proceed-
ed to'turn about and denounce
Yankee Capitalists.” He
slowly and surely
every American-owned com-
pany in Cuba in the name of
“the Cuban ' Republic.”
at negotiations were

each time they ended without

' success because of some impos-

sible demands put forth by the
Cubans.

Finally, after enduring many
months of embarrassment,_ at the
hands of the Cuban government,
the United States had to sever

‘diplomatic ties with Cuba. Since
then almost every other Ameri-

The

A

\

can country_has followed suit.
Mr. Harm says that some sort

of normal relations should- be
re-establishedfbut, I feel that
until Dr. ‘Castro, shows some
signs of cooperation, resuming
diplomatic relations would serve
no useful purpose and could
only lead to further embarrass-
ment of the United States.

Mr._ Harm further stated that
the U.S. blockade was a “. . .
unilateral act of war which ‘took
the world closer to the brink of
nuclear disaster than it had
been in over a decade.”

Legally Mr. Harm was right,
it was an act of war. But moral-
ly the United States’ action was
even more right. It was much
safer to create this type of dam-
ger where relatively sane minds
were in control of the world’s
atomic power than to let Cas-
tro’s'V missile bases be completed,
thus putting this power into the
hands of a highly irratic and
emotional dictator‘ who could at
any time give the order which
could destroy the lives _of mil-
lions of peace—loving Americans,
like Mr. Harm. .

Sports Editor,

Not the Right Light . ..

The Wayward ‘

Press’ 

By Barry Cross

The possibly imminent collapse of the Post-
Gazette, just when it has increased its readability
by adding the New York Times News Service, will
bring more sorrow to members of the University
community than to other edu-
cated people.

While all intelligent «news-
paper readers will be unhappy
when Pittsburgh becomes a one-
paper town, anyone_who has any
pride in the University will have
good reason to shudder because
the Press has been anything but
fair to this University.

The most recent example of
unfairness’ and poor journ'alism
occurred on the Sunday after the
’Pitt-Syracuse game. -On that morning area resi-
dents found an account of a ﬁght between two stu-
dents that had erupted during the closing moments
of the Homecoming game streaked down the front
page with a large picture, as if it had been a full-
scale riot. 2 ~ «

,The Press maynot realize this, but they could
get a similar story during every home’ game, there’s
always at least one brief ﬁght" in thestudent sec-'
tion. Perhaps only timidity has stopped them from"
doing so and making the story a regular front-page
feature. ' ,

Other Press coverage of the University, though,
has shown anything but timimidy, and anything
but good taste. ‘
Gill Displayed Gall .

Two years ago Press reporter William Gill,‘
for whatever the reasons, showed that he could
take over the editorship of The National -Enquirer
or The New York Daily News with little difﬁ’culty
as far as ability to slant facts is concerned. His
vicious articles concerning the furor over Profes-
sor’ Robert Col0dny’s political beliefs constituted.
yellow journalism that stood out even in the Press-
and prompted a front-page editorial in The Pitt

News  I, o ' ,

A few months ago, our unfortunately only after-
noon daily gleefully" pointed out that the Univer-
sity had. purchased a house in which Dr. Alan C.
Rankin, vice-chancel'lor for student and general af-‘
fairs, would -live. It was certainly a ﬁtting sequel

' newspaper.
_ Howard chain, one of its more successful links. It

to the furor they had magniﬁed when the question
of tax-free status for Chancellor Litchﬁeld’s home
had been raised. _

One cannot say that all they ever do is malign
the University. They give adequate and sympa-
thetic coverage of _Pa‘nther football games, and are

‘always more than happy to have a reporter inter-;

view a member of the University community —

they make such interesting feature material. Yes,

they certainly create no breach in objectivity when
it comes to “harmless” articles.

It just seems that, time and again, the Press
manages to present the"University to its readers as
some sore‘ of malignancy that threatens.Pittsburgh.
A paper such as the Press, especially in an almost
one-"paper town, is more of“ a threat.

"The Press Hostile ,

In an attempt to discover the reason for this‘
hostility let us analyze, at least superﬁcially, this
The Press is part of .the Scripps-

utilizes United Press lnternational and Scripps-
Howard reports for out—of—state news, and has its

' own reporters for area news..

Not crude, like The National Enquirer, for ex-
ample, it would not think of "saying to its readers
that taxpayers’ burdens. will be increased if the
University “gets away” with a tax-free status for

the Chancellor’s home, but instead sweetly reminds 

readers that this status means a loss to the city“
of so much in possible revenue.

As its lighthouse beam swings around the city
to “Give the people light,” it carefully touches upon
areas where near—sensational'ismTis possible, shad-
ing events and blinding people to objectivity-. Why?

' The ‘city of Pittsburgh is losing'its heavy in-
dustry. Its future role seems to. be that of an edu-

' cational—research center. The University is leading

this change which can be the salvation of Pitts-
burgh. This change, like any change, isihurting a
lot of people. They are more than happy to buy
andreadia paper iwhich attacks that institution
which is a symbol ofthis ‘change. Attacking the
University, might help sell papers. Look at the poor '
Post-Gazette,_ its circulation disappearing into its
objectivity. The‘ -Press isnltbeing nasty, it’s just
being successful! ' ’

‘ Course Confusion . . .

Distributi

n.Di|emma 

By Jacki Katz

1

Now that registration is here agzyin, it is time’

for 'us to review the Distribution of Studies re-
quirements. According to the Student Handbook,
this program “offers the student increased oppor-
tunity to broaden his knowledge ‘
of~ the disciplines and to deepen .
his understanding of one area or
discipline.” Many students do
not feel‘ that this is true.

The new program which went
into effect when last year’s
freshman class entered, —-states
that a student must take -15
credits each in Natural Sciences.
Social Science, and Humanities. ,
These credits have to be in cer-» 
tain courses, most of which are
just general survey courses. This year it was an-
nounced that if a student took both Chemistry 11
and 12, he would only get destribution credit for 11.
Likewise with English 80 and 81, and many other
courses. .

This would be good if the old curriculum were
still in effect. Then students were allowed to take
any. courses as long as they had 18 credits in each
of the thre ﬁelds, not counting those credits taken
in their major. This program was ‘much better
because students could take those courses in which
they were interested. With the new program this
is not always possible.
Science Leaves Little Time. _ ,

Letus take, for example, a science major. Once
he fulﬁlls all of his major requirements and his
distribution requirements there is little time left
for him to take electives in many ﬁelds. The new
Distribution of Studies program has been set up.
so that a student can take courses in many ﬁelds
and then take advanced courses in those areas in
which he wishes to further his‘ knowledge. But

usually he does not have much time in which to '

do this.

With the old program in effect-a student had

time to‘ develop his _interests- in :the are e
‘    

 

  
 

take two or. three English courses, he could. Nowt
he can only take one for distribution, and others
if he has time. A Philosophy of Science course is

yof. interest to many science majors. Yet it is not
distribution and can not ‘always be ﬁt into a sched--..;w_.
ule. This situation can “be, reversed-‘also, although}

an English major can take- one course in each of

A the natural sciences. But one can not really learn

-much frorn_ one course in a science, or iniany other
"ﬁeld for -that matter. - ‘ , , ‘
' - The Distribution program was set up so that
students could get a very liberal education. Yet,‘
many areas do not offer a course for distribution.
For example, no math course is offered for distri-
bution, yet many majors require that one have a

knowledge of math. Advisors have been saying

 

/4.-

. T

that there will soon be a distribution course for}:

math. When? Also it is highly improbable that
math could ever be taught in a general survey
course. -‘
Few Humanity Courses Offered

Few'courses are offeredin the humanities that
can be taken for’ distribution credit. Yet students
are required to take ﬁve different courses in ﬁve
‘different departments. If this is the way the pro-
gram is to beset up, more humanities. courses
should be offered for distribution credit.

A distribution program at the University would L L

be good if the courses had been established prior
to the start of the program. ,It would also be good
if students were allowed to take those courses
which they wanted, rather than those courses which
they must take merely because that’s the way some
people feel they will better get a liberal education,
Many people will do much better in something they
want to do rather than something they are fol-ced
to do.  ‘

A couple of courses in history would much

sity students. ‘

Tom Olofson, SG President, is*

interested in the possible forma-
tion of la» People-to-People chap-
ter at the University. As he said,
“The matter of student relation-
ships is seriously and thoroughly
considered as a most important
Student Government function.”
Chapter To Serve V

As Olofson suggested, a chapter
on campus would serve to act as
an exchange of ideas between the
University and other schools with
Foreign Student programs. In this
manner, new ideas could be ex-
changed and a formal program
could be started with the Ameri-

' 'can students and the foreign stu—.

dents.

Olofson said, “It is the Amer-
ican student's opportunity to
learn about foreign countries
and the foreign student’s oppor-

tunity to learn about America.”
'Olofson’s interest in Peop1e-to-
People was generated when he
participated in a conference‘ called

by Governor Lawrence to dis-
cuss the program last October. At
that conference .Olofson learned
that‘ 15 % of Pennsylvania’s for-
eign students are at the Univer-
sity., I
Programs To Aid

Peopl_e-to—People has programs
to- aid ‘in the understanding of
foreign students, and serves as an
aid to them. It provides a means
for assimilating them into the
collegiate and American society
while they are here, and. at‘-
tempts to help colleges provide
for a worthwhile and successful
atmosphere for their foreign stu-
dents.

Europe Study A
Program Open

A Liberal Arts junior will
have the opportunity to
spend the 1963 summer vaca-
tion doing research in Europe
as a member of the European
Program in International Af-
fairs, Dr. Albert B. Martin, dean
of the School of Liberal Arts, has
announced.

The program, under the direc-
tion of Princeton University, is
partially subsidised by a grant
from the Carnegie Corporation of:
New York. It enables small group
of students from several colleges
and universities to do research
and study in Western Europe for
the three months between their
junior and senior years.

Seminars Planned

The program will begin with a
two-week seminar at The Hague
in the Netherlands. After that the
students travel to the country
which they have chosen for their
research. Much of the material
gathered during the summer will
form the basis for an honor thesis
or paper. At the close of the sum-
mer, the group will meet at Ox-
ford for a final seminar.

Any interested student may
obtain application blanks from
the Liberal Arts ollice, 917 CL.
The deadline for obtaining the
applications is November 28 and
the deadline for filing them is
December 3.

John T. McKechnie, a senior
majoring in political science, par-
ticipated in the program last year.

Shirley Jackson, mistress
of the macabre, has once
again tried her hand at scar-
ing the living daylights out
of the reading public with
her latest novel, We Have Alway/s
Lived in the Castle (Viking Press;
214 pp.; $3.95).

Creator of several other subtle
and not-so-subtle shockeroo nov-
els and short stories, Miss Jack-
son again has told ‘a story with
learn characterizations against a
background of lean it‘ unique set-
ting yielding an unforgettable
moral or mood. -

The moral is lost in this latest
effort but the moodis, indeed, a
happily original one. _

Let’s Just Call Her

‘Mary Katherine Blackwood is
an 18 year old neurotic-—no, psy-
chotic—-well, let’s just call her a
Jackson creation. At any rate,
this narrator lives in a gigantic,
timeless house near a timeless vil-
lage with her older’ sister, Con-
stance, and her paralyzed uncle,
Julian.

In the cou_rtroom, that is.

For the entire village believes
so strongly that a murderer is liv-
ing in the Blackwood mansion
that the two girls and their uncle
have become hermits, only leaving
the house to purchase necessities
and admitting few, if any, visitors.

"Some Scars’

Such a life has, of course, left
some mental scars for the Black-
woods. Mary Katherine, or Mer-
ricat, as her sister fondly calls
her, often believes she is on the
moon. She also likes to stretch out
near the creek where she has
buried “treasure” and listen to the
stories her cat tells.

She and her ‘sister carefully
move through their even stranger
house, creating a nagging tension.
The routine of the Blackwoods, as
described in such bizarre terms
by Merricat, almost conceals the
suspense which -Miss Jackson so
expertly builds. But suddenly, the
reader is aware that suspense has
been gathering, and that the nar-
rator’s fear of Change is going to

MUTINYON THE BOUNTY -

The football ship here has fallen upon‘ rough seas once
again. ,

Following the Syracuse football game, a much-maligned
quarterback named Jim Traﬁcant got fed up with the ad-
verse remarksabout his play and the demotion—prom'otion
merry-go-round that he was riding. . ‘ _

The senior from Youngstown.didn’t digest his troubles.

‘ His stomach wa_s soured and
he spit out the venom. H-e
squared off with the coaches.

An argument_ with’ quarter-
back coach Lou “Bimbo” Cec-
coni is now general knowl-
edge among many students,

Coach Staff Beraied _
According to reports, Traﬁ-
cant said, “Pitt has the worst
coaching staff in the country,
“I’ve made the twobig mis-
takes in my life,” he contin-
ued. “The ﬁrst one was com-
ing here; the second’ one was
staying.” ' .
It appeared for a while
‘ that Traﬁcant might quit
school, but his father. advis-
ed him not to. He had_not
started against Syracuse,

1 Jim Traficanf .
but he handled the bulk of the chores. - _
Still,_’he was second-string when the team assembled for
practice the following week. Quarterback Fred Mazurek
started ‘against Notre Dame, but was plucked early and only

saw action in three offensive plays.

Now the Panthers had two quarterbacks with upset '

stomachs. Mazurekwas broiling when he returned to the‘
campus. He had been running with the first team in prac-
tice all week before the Irish game, but saw little action_
there. ; ‘

Traﬁcant is still scathing from
for his behavior in the Syracuse game. He reportedly was
calling quick signals in the game so that Coach John Michelo-
sen would not have time. to send in his own plays.

The Minutemen - N I t . ’

And_he was not alone in his rebellion. Many of the
veteranﬁrst stringers have been siding, with him. So factions
have been formed. The reserves are still anxious to play so
they have been smiling when the coaches look their way.

Many of the front-line lballplayers have been under-
mining the inﬂuence of the brass in conﬁdential conversa-
tion withfaculty, fans and students.

There has been much dissension among players who felt
that outstanding performances weren’t being rewarded with
advancement. ‘ ‘

Although we haven’t heard anything from them, we
would say that Tackle Ernie Borghetti and Linebacker
Bernie LaQuinta have axes to grind. ' _

Borghetti was outstanding against Syracuse, recovering
a fumble for a TD, and being credited with numerous indivi-
dual tackles. He didn’t start against Notre,Dame. When he
played, he stood up, and was totally ineffective.

LaQuinta has been outstanding every time he has had a
chance this year. Yet he has missed whole games by coaching
choice. He still doesn’t start.

Individuals have come up for criticism singularly for the
ﬁrst time in the ’Michelosen regime. Traﬁcant was one of
them, especially against West Virginia when he was caught
sightseeing too much, trying to throw. ‘

Word has come forth that the team couldn’t possibly
ready itself emotionally for the Notre Dame game.

When all hands on deck don’t pull the ropes together, a
ship.can go dow_n. Pitt has managed to keep its equilibrium
perfectly with a 4-4 record. Hold your breath.

Bemis Surprised by Official
Saylor Point System Rating

BULLETIN

The soccer team has received
. as regional representative of the

a bid to the NCAA tourn_ament
district encompassing Pennsyl-

vania, Delaware, and New Jersey. They have a Saylor Point
rating of 231.5 points compared to runner-up West Chester’s 205.

The team -will meet the winner

of this week’s Maryland-Navy

game on Saturday at a site to be announced. ,

By JIIVI O’BRIEN and FRED MARCUS

If Aristotle were picking

the soccer team that would

represent the Pennsylvania—New Jersey-Delaware district in
the NCAA tournament he would select Pitt, according to the

thinking of Coach Leo Bemis.

Bemis says "Pitt is undeniably the logical choice, but so
was Tom Dewey. And petty politics may influence the choice

here, too.

The four teams who are receiving ‘top consideration in
this district are Elizabethtown, Farleigh-Dickinson, East

Stroudsburg an_d Pitt.
Trio Decides
The local selection committee

9.

Saylor System, a‘ mathematical
evaluation formula, will not be
the ﬁnal measuring stick. A three-
man committee will make the ﬁnal
choice with the Saylor ratings up-
permost in mind. -

The committee chairman is
Mel Lorback, coach of West.
Chester. The other two mem-'
bers are George Glascow, of
Farleigh-Dickinson, and Bemis,
of Pitt.

Bemis says that, according to
his own information, the Saylor
System favors East Stroudsburg,
who have a 9-1 record. They have
compiled 2350 Saylor points by
Bemis’ ﬁgures, while the Panthers
have registered 2100 points during
nine games with a 7-0-2 mark.

Close Race

This averages out to 235 points
per game for the team from

northeast, Pennsylvania, 4 while the
Panthers have a 233 mean. “The
Saylor points are too close to be
the determining factor,” Bemis
said. '4 1 "

He discounts Farleigh—I)ickin-
son because they lost two games
against Howard and West Ches-
ter. The Panthers beat Howard,
3-1, and tied West Chester 3-3.

To make matters more confus- '

ing, Elizabethtown has beaten
Stroudsburg, 2-0, and "lost to West

fused" "Bemis.
To Each His Own

Athletic Director—Harvey Wood
of Farleigh—Dickinson told The
Pitt News, however, that “since
we are under consideration, Glas-
cow will probably cast his vote
for Farleigh-Dickinson.

“Based on the Saylor System,
we feel our chances are pretty
good,” Wood added, “since we
play a lot of “A” teams.”

“How he can defend his own
team I don’t see,” said Bemis,
emphasizing once again that
Farleigh-Dickinson had lost two

games. “I don’t see how he can

to our faces, Saylor points or
no.9!

So what does Bemis plan to do?
“I will vote for Pitt,” he ex-
claimed. -

The charges, counter-charges
and name-calling have this matter

looking like another Scranton-
Dilworth tug-of-war. _

' Charges Filed

Bemis claims that the only

strong teams .that East Strouds-
burg faced were Elizabethtown
and West Chester; He also charges
that some'of’their victims, along
with those of Elizabethtown, are
not-NCAA teams. ' _,
He says the selection board is
only supposed to consider the
records against N C A A’_ teams.
“It will be up‘ to Lorback,”
Bemis said. ‘fl don’t see how he
can logically pick them over us.
Unless he comes out and says
that his team had a bad day
against us and that Farleigh-
Dickinson should’ve ‘b e a t en

“West Chester came to Pitts-

Bemis said, according to reports

Larry Robinson, who was ﬁrst

lost his chance to go to the IC4A
when he ﬁnished fourth behind
three Mountaineer harriers. A

beaten Robinson in seven meets.
The decision not to enter any-

prompted by the poor perform-
