College Editors Rap With Legislators

By PAUL STOLLER
Editor, The Pitt News A
HARRISBURG, March 4 — Student newspa-
per editors from Pennsylvania universities were
here yesterday to meet with members of the leg-

islature to discuss their opposition to the “student _

conduct” bill sponsored by State Senator Robert
D. Fleming (R.-Aspinwall). The legislation pass-
ed the State Senate last week.

Editors from The Temple News, The Indiana
Penn, The Daily Collegian (Penn State ), The Daily
Pennsylvanian, The CMU Tartan and The Pitt
News were roaming about the capital yesterday.

Legislators here said that the ultimate pas-
sage of the Fleming bill remains in limbo. How-
ever, the mood of the House indicates passage of
the bill. The Democratic leadership said yester-
day that, they would be unable to hold the bill in the
Education Committee. In previous years. the
power to withhold a bill from the floor rested with

the committee chairman. Under‘ new House pro--

cedural guidelines, however, any committee with
a two-thirds majority vote can move a bill out to
the floor. The Fleming-bill is expected toreach the
House floor sometime next week. And if there are

no committee amendments, it could be passed in

two weeks.

 

   

SENATOR ROBERT FLEMING

Some Democratic members of the House
Education Committee said they might attempt

two tactical manuevers to weaken the bill. They .

may allow the bill to be passed in its present form
and allow the courts to interpret its constitution-
ality, or they may totally amend the Fleming
legislation by substituting a narrowly defined
criminal trespass law.

If the Education Committee votes for a tres-
pass amendment, ‘a Senate House Conference
Committee must be formed. If members of the
Senate fail to. accept the compromise, some leg-
islators said, the bill will die in conference.

The Pennsylvania editors also learned about
some news emanating from the Penn State cam-
pus. The president of SDS there is being brought
before a special discipline committee created
by Penn State President Eric A. Walker. The
committee consists of three students, three mem-
bers of the faculty, and three administrators.
The SDS president, who is expected to graduate in
two weeks, will probably be suspended accord-
ing to reliable source.

The newly formed committee, the source
said, did not allow the Penn State SDS president '

to have representation of a lawyer. The American I

Civil Liberties Union is investigating the inci-

dent. _

Spock Calls

by RUTH ZAPLIN
Staff News Writer

“Up until a year ago I used to
speak to soggy middle—aged audi-
ences about babies. Now I’m
grateful to Lyndon Johnson for
enlarging my platform,” quipped

Dr. Spock,in a speech given Mon-

day in the SU Ballroom.

The famed baby doctor enum-
erated his reasons for calling the
war in Vietnam “illegal and im-
moral.” His first objection was
that U.S. intervention violated the
Geneva Accordes. He also attri-
buted the unnecessary presence

of the U.S. to the SEATO Treaty ‘

which was actually a call to dis-
cuss the Vietnam situation and not
a call for manpower.

A further complaint’ was the
fact that in 1960, the Viet Cong
uprising wasn't reffered to the
UN like it should have been. Said
Spock, “The U.S. only brings mat_-
ters to the UN when she has noth-
ing to gain, otherwise she just in-
tervenes at will.“

“Furthermore, Lyndon Johnson
in February, 1965, escalated the
war without getting a declaration
of war from Congress. This was
a violation of the Constitution. It
was also just three months after
he was elected as a peace candi-
date,” said Spock.

Dr. Spook stressed the fact that
the U. S. was and is unable to
make any progress at any time in
Vietnam. He believes ‘that “the
only, people on our side there are
the mandarin class — those few
upper class members considered
to be traitors by the majority of
the Vietnamese."

Spock explained that he signed
the call to resist legitimate au-
thority. “It was just taking a stand
with those boys who believe they
have the moral right not to fight
in a war they don’t believe in,"
‘he said. -"I maintain that they not

War In Vietnam ‘Immoral’

“The Lyndon Johnson regime ._arid the ‘American “C-ioivernifient is guilty.” '

gal right not to fight because all
the illegalities that the U.S. is
putting in Vietnam nullify the Se-
lective Service laws. “

Continuing, Spock stated, “I
never believed I was. guilty. I

have as much right as anyone to

consult with a lawyer when I
think I am doing the right thing.
Then it is up to the courts to de-
cide. Unfortunately, many of the
decisions of the court, even the
Supreme Court, are split. Some-
times even they can't decide who
is right or wrong.” A

Dr. Spock feels that we are in
Southeast Asia “partly to control
the raw materials and partly out
of fear of Chinese Communism.
We set China up as our foes at a
time when we.didn‘t needitoz" '

.“The U._S. is much more»im-

‘perialistic since WW II.’.' Spock F’
‘-but if-“we d'on'~t want

   

 

to destroy ourselves in a nuclear

war. we've got to. reverse this J

trend. It seems, we are nice only
to those people we can identify
with or condescend to. but if they
are black. yellow or red, we man-
age to keep our eyes and ears
closed.” .

Dr. Spock cites our industries
and the Pentagon as the main pres-
sures forcing us to be imperialis-
tic. Said Spock, “You can keep
calling yourself the good guys be-

A cause everyone will get destroy-

ed in the process.”

Dr. Spock does not advocate
violence but “if the people suffer
injustice they must try all legal
means and. lastly, they are en-
titled to a revolution.” For ex-
ample. he feels that the.B1acks
have a moral right to have a revo-
lution even, ‘though “violence is

A-dangerousi becuase you-. lose ad- .

 

herence andyou are likely to pro-'
voke counter-violence. ”

Switching topics, Spock men-
tioned the Democratic convention
and today’s youth. “I think that
the 8,000 young people had every
right to be in Chicago and Mayor
Daley was totally wrong not to
give them permits. If America is
to be saved it will be by the
young people who look injustices
in the eye. They have idealism"
and courage to work for causes,
even though they know they are
going to get beaten up,” he said.

Dr. Spock concluded his speech
by praising young Americans.
And, it was on this note that when
questioned about the Fleming bill,
Spock unhesitatingly replied,
“Don’t waste any time——start send- .
ing those delegations to protest in- L
Harrisbur,gnow'.’’ ' - « i I '- 

   

audiences.”

' tainly am, I’m.very ashamed.'v‘'

“Rejuvenation” was the wordy,-"'
Dr. Benjamin Spock used to des-
cribe the effect his trial and con- ' I
viction -for supporting personal,
dissent on Vietnam has had. In a ,.

well-known baby doctor explain-7
‘ed why he felt the need to sup-
port the dissentors. - ‘ - 

The Nuremberg Principles,
which outline the individual’s re-

caused Dr. Spock to lend his sup-

Language Proposal 32% °?.:“n'::i-'1::;:‘s‘"»e:;‘.°   .

Nothing has been kicked around
more at this campus than the two year
language‘ requirement. The cries
for its death echo from Fitzgerald

- Field House -to Panther Hollow Lake.

Abolish it. Restructure it. Don’t give let;
ter grades. The cries resound, through
editorial comment in this newspaper,
through letters to the editor, and
through discussion in every part of the
University.

Graduate assistants in the language
department have discussed the obli-

.. gation in their classes, and in most in-

stances, have defended it. Some say
languages are taught wrong; while
others say, the content is insufficient
or irrelevant‘.

Linguistic instructors support solely
the teaching of the structuring of
language. Others in the departments
say the language course should give
more cultural background or provide a

' greater literature value for students.

The question of who is right remains
up in the air, but most people in all
areas of the University agree that the
REQUIREMENT of a language for two
years is wasteful. Where grades are‘
maintained, students (especially fresh-
men) often times find themselves back-
ed into a wall by academic proba-
tion, suspension, and in some cases ex-
pulsion from school. ' ‘

Misunderstanding and misinterpre-

tation of the language situation have

also resulted. For "example, the head
of one language department didn’t even

Editor, The Pitt News: . . .

I am not in the habit of writing to the
Pitt News; I do not consider myself to be
one of the more intelligent students at Pitt,
nor do I feel I express my opinions as
clearly as many.'However, after reading
Mr. Al Morris’ letter printed in the Feb-
ruary 24 edition of th_e Pitt News I am
beginning to have second thoughts. I would
like to disagree strongly with Mr. Morris
on several points. --

First of all, Mr. Morris started by saying

' that some at Pitt have discovered that “stu-

dents are getting away with too much” when
they bring demands to the Chancellor. Al-
though there is some doubt in my mind as

‘to whether the ultimate result of their ef-

fort will be up to their expectations, I com-
mend them,‘ never the less, for their con-
cern.

The students who submitted these de-

1 , mands knew what they were talking about; '

they came prepared with criticism,
proof, and demands; and I feel that their
actions ‘showed a genuine conscientious-
ness as students in an academic communi-
ty. They were at the 2 demonstrations, I
was at the 2 demonstrations, where was Mr.
Morris? I did not see him, and, if he was .
there, why did he not stand up and express
his opinion. Everyone there was free to
speak his mind.

I suppose that those students did “get
away with too much” in the eyes of many;
but, the fact is that they did it whileMr.
Morris sat idle when it came time to op-
pose them, if that is what he choses to do —

Ii , in front of the Chancellor and the rest of

the students who were concerned or at
b least curious enough to go.

    
   

know the language requirement was
under fire from all corners of the Uni-
versity. When his department in-
structors informed him that it has been
attacked for the last six years, he was
more than slightly surprised.

Recent rumblings. in the adminis-
tration have it that something is be-
ing done, but what it is remains as
cloudy as an early Pittsburgh morning.

Everyone seems to have a differ-
ent solution to the problem, but as of
yet no proposal has been made. The
opinions of theed-itorial board of this
newspaper are just as varied. But
at this time, The Pitt News would like
to propose the following:

First, abolish the two year re-
quirement of a language. In-
stitute a one year (two terms) re-
quirement on a PASS-FAIL basis.

Second, make a second year of
language OPTIONAL in that a
student has a choice of continu-
ing in either a conversational
language program or a cultural-
literature plan. This second year
option would continue on a PASS-
FAIL basis. ‘

This plan could appease both the
anti-requirement contingent and the an-
t_igr,ades contingent. Language is need-
ed to fulfill the ideology of a liberal
arts program, but to burden students
with a two year obligation is ridicu-

lous. Those who want to continue will

most certainly do so; while those who
desire only to meet degree require-
ment will not be restricted. —G.M.L.

Secondly, Mr. Morris attacks Alterna-
tives for using language that “no profes-
sor would stand for . . . in the classroom.”
I am sure Mr. Morris was not in my Speech
53 class-yes, Speech, no less — but the pro-

. , fessor’s choice of words at times was such

that it makes those used in the Alterna-
tives seem trite. But the use of words to me
is not the basic issue.

One of the important points raised at the -

open forum was that Chancellor Posvar
permitted the head of Central Printing to
refuse to print a certain quotation because
of a matter of the printers personal con-
science, when at the same time, many
University professors are obligated tolgive
grades to students when the professors feel
they should not in accordance with their
conscience ——‘ a matter, I should think. of

-more importance than a dispute over “pro-

fane” words which, in one case, were part
of a quotation — ironically enough, Mr.
Morris, the quotation of a prominent mem-
ber of a Department of the University of
Pittsburgh.

Thirdly, Mr. Morris has again missed the
issue at hand in his stand on the Senator
Fleming dilemma. Dr. Posvar never once

That Proper Balance

 

by GEORGE LIES
Associate Editor

Dr. Benjamin Spock, one of the finest
representatives of the old people, came to
tell us young ones what we’ve known for
the past three years, that the Vietnam con-
flict is ugly. . -. _

He tells us the U.S.
government has been
pulling the strings of a
puppet regime in the
better interest of indus-

    

“The Lyndon Johnson -‘
regime /and the Amer- ,  
ican government is  ,»_f..a"f  "
guilty,” he claims. “The  " 
war is totally illegal  '
and immoral.” MR- LIES

AH THE VOICE of the establishment
snaps at itself, only in this instance, it is
the voice of a man who has given himself
for young men who will never again see
the Golden Gate bridge, the Statue of Lib-
erty, or Willie Mays on the fly. \ '

The voice, strong in spirit and enthusiasm,
has echoed the sobs and anguishes of
wifes and mothers of this land, yet it has

' been stifled by laws which in its own words
should be judged by citizens both consci-
ously and morally.

It is this same paradox that pushes edi-
tors of newspapers to at one time condemn
the war, while at other times, cite it as a
deterrent to Communism in Asia.

Ironically, many of these same editors

ignore the Vietnam tragedy when they look
at the Middle East feud. Take the Chris-

’. tian Science Monitor in its Feb. 28 editor-

ial. “The Next Israeli Goyernment.”

IT SAYS, in part, . . . . we still believe
that long-term peace in the Middle East
must eventually come through compro-
mise, through restraint and through a de-

 

Alexis de Tocqueville,
America: “One could compare America to a forest
pierced by a multitude of straight roads all converg-

termination to do nothing to heighten ten-
_ sion. This applies with equal force to
both sides. ~

“(We) have consistently supported the
view that the time has come for the larger
powers, above all America and Russia,
to use their weight to bring about as even-
handed and as lasting a settlement in the
Middle East as diplomacy can effect.”

This viewpoint is absurd; and is slanted
toward the victimized American citizen
whose basis for judging right from wrong
rests on a precarious Vietnam myth, pro-
pigated by the idea that U. S. military for-
,ces are patriotically servingthe country.

HOW CAN ANY newspaper editor slap,
first the hands of a Jewish people who have

been dying to sustain their very history,

and then the hands of an Arab people who
want to restore what they feel is their very
country.

And then how can he assume the Middle
East crisis will cool if the two top nuclear
dogs butt-in even more than they have
already. In the past, they’ve‘helped with
arms, tanks, and financial support, but
words mean very little when people fight
for existence, and a diplomat doesn’t hold

out a white flag when he knows he’ll get '

shot the minute he shows his face.

Yes, judgment of right from wrong is the
essence of Dr. Benjamin Spock’s words.
And it is this judgment that makes it wrong
for America and Russia to have a say in
what happens between Jew and Arab.

“IF WE DON’T get justice,” Dr. Spock
said Monday, “we get angry. And law and

order must be restored for justice to be tol7°.ﬁ-

erated. ”

History itself must be tolerated, especial-
ly the mistakes. But somewhere along the
line, consistency-should be established if
the blind-folded goodess is to maintain
that proper balance of all situations.

would admit it if such were the case that
there are? Does Gimbels tell Macey’s
what they’re doing? .

But of all the statements, the one that
the students “do not own the University,
but merely rent its services” is the one
which I find most offensive. No, ‘the stu-
dents do not_ own the University — they
are the University. This University is a non-
profit making institution existing in part
to serve the student. and in wholeito pro-

If these concerned students are expres-

agrees or not with their opinions, they
are to be admired for their mere expres-
sion. if not more. The students to be cri-
ticized are those who either express no
opinion at all making no constructive con-

ample knowledge of the matters at handﬁ.

and, thus. fail to make a contribution of

Finally, Mr. Morris says that “the state

I should have some say as to the behavi_or

of the students and the operation of the col-
lege. Well, Mr. Morris, the state has that
right already. Under the provision of state-
relatedness, a certain number of the 36

ber is directly appointed by the President _.

"$2362-9000

March,1969

This is neither a newsletter about local war resistance
activities, nor the beginning of a critque on the draft.
For this Publication carries little news. What is said
here is not so comprehensible and expressible that it
can be put into a critical essay. Rather this collec-
tion is by and about individuals in many different
places and times who have realized that they must
live and remain themselves in the context of thewar
and the draft. ’

Not all of the contributors have responded to the de-
mands of the Selective Service System in the same
way. Some have returned draft cards, others applied
for conscientious objector classification. All have re-

sponded to certain demands of their government by

saying "No. I cannot do this. I have chosen a way
of life which does not include what you ask me to do."

Not all the responses included here were made by

 

draft-age men. As the last page ;_ “'5 this Sanc_,
tuary?-- indicates the situation which faces draft-‘
age m\en faces us all, regardless of age.

All of the writing reflects, we think, a great deal of
questioning of the writer's own values, of how to
resolve a disparity between expressed beliefs and
inaction. This collection is published in the hope that
the writings will raise questions which the reader,
too, has not considered before. ‘

The collection presented here does/ not, by any
means, represent the views of all draft resistersin

Poem Dedicated to
Draft Refusers in Prison

I don't know you,

You don't know me,

Yet, as people, brothers, ;

we have something in common,
But there is more.

For your life has, as

“.."pebble in a pond, affected

mine, and others like me.

Sometimes there seems to be no
way to affect life forces.

and, alone, pessimism and the
feeling of futility and despair

almost engulfs life. But not quite.

We go'on, and act, and try to

live, as-a man said, while not
standing on another ma_n's shoulders.

But your life has affected mine.

And maybe mine will affect others,

For someday I will be sitting within the stone
not wanting to live.

while standing,

on another man's shoulders.

The first step in the
procurement of
military manpower
is registration.

-Lewis B. Hershey

Dear Beloved Friends,

This is just to let you know that on February 3, ‘I969,
in the United States District Court for the Western Dis-
trict.of Pennsylvania I was found guilty of failing to
present myself for and submit to registration for the
Selective Service System. I have been sentenced to a
maximum of three years imprisonment and shall begin
my sentence on February 13, 1969. ‘

I hearthe question, "Why?" every day now, whether
it_ is directly or indirectly posed. One very simple reply

.is that I looked at the nature of the draft and asked

that same question, "Why?" Why does our government
need to force men to train to kill their brothers be-
cause of political differences? And how can the pri-
vileged and the exempted look at themselves in the mir-
ror every morning, knowing that another unfortunate has
been compelled to go in his place? What does this
submission to illegitimate authority over the consciences
of men do to the health of our moral fibre?

We assume as a nation that physical luxury and pros-
perity at the expense of countless impoverished fellow
human beings is freedom from want. We no longer
question what the implicationsiof electing more suave yet
dictatorial politicians are for the development of indivi-
dual self-government. We are even so bold as to pre-
determine what form of government other men must
choose in order to be “free." Finally, the extent of the
military’s involvement in all our lives had made us des-
pair of ever turning from the present nihilistic course.
This hopelessness leads us to exchange the unflinching
vigor of visions for a pampered existence in a decay-
ing culture.

I have not appealed the court's decision, but I am ask-
ing each of my friends to be my appeal agents as
they witness against all injustice in whatever way they
will. We can stop planting the seeds of future con-
flicts byliving lives which "take away the occasion of
all wars." Let us look at each day as an opportunity
to make peace wherever we are. I send my heartfelt
gratitude for all of your concern and look forward to a
reunion with you again. We are a community in spirit
and our hearts reach across those superficial barriers
placed between us. Go gently in search of the Light
in all men.

Love, . . .
Stephen Mayo Shaffer

What the world expects of Christians is that Christians
should speak out loud and clear . . .' in such a way
that never a doubt, never the slightest doubt, could rise
in the heart of the simplest man. That they should get
away from abstraction and confront the bloodstained
face history has taken on today. The grouping we need
is a grouping of men resolved to speak out clearly an
pay up personally. '
Albert Camus

‘Excerpts from the dialoge between Stephen Shaffer and
Judge Sorg on Stephen's plea of nolo contendere:

Judge Sorg: Do you believe you are guilty of this of-
fense? '

Stephen Shaffer: Morally? No I do’ not.

Sorg: Are you aware that a plea of nolo contendere
subjects you to all the penalties of a plea of guilty?

Shaffer: "Thou shalt love they neighbor as thyseIfC"_

I may have the right to give my life, but I do not have
the right to kill other men for an idea. Registration
with the Selective Service System is the first step in this
system. I cannot be a part of this. I cannot lend "my
name to this. I cannot take a priviledged position while
another man goes in my place. I am willing to go to
prison if,l must to testify to this belief. The charge

reads "United States of America versus Stephen Mayof

Shaffer." Yet. I love my country. It takes love to turn
our nation around. That is my only defense, your hon-
or.

Sorg: Is there any reason why sentence should not be

imposed? . ‘
Shaffer: I have broken a statute. I do not feel it is

right for men to set up systems wherebythey kill other .

men for political or ideological ends.
SOFQ If. you have registered and requested conscien-

tious. objector classification would you be willing to per- 2

form alternative service?

Shaffer: If I had registered and if I had requested C_O
classification I would perform alternative service. But,
I have neither registered nor requested a CO form.

Sorg: You have continually emphasized your desire to
.work for your fellow man. If you. and the Selective

Service System agreed on some sort of constructive work_

would you be willing to perform that work? Why do you
object to doing service in the national interest, helping
your fellow man to live?

Shaffer: It is not for the Selective Service System to de-
cide how we should serve. That is a matter for every
individual with his God. ’

Ideas bec_ome powerful only if they appear in the flesh;
an idea which does not lead to action by the individ-
ual and by groups remain at best a paragraph on a
footnote in a book--provided the idea is fresh and rele-
vant. It is like a seed stored in a dry place. If the idea
is to have influence, it must be put in the soil and the
soil is people and groups of people."

from The Revolution of Hope -- Erich Fromm

Selective Service System of Pennsylvania
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15222

To Whom it May Concern:

I will continue to withold willful cooperation with the
Selective Service System for three main reasons. First
of all, conscription denies a young man the right to
make his own decisions concerning vocation and life
style. For a vocation is an occupation to which one is
called by God and not by an institution which pre-
sumes to determine what a man must do to serve “the
national interest". The Selective Service Act therefore
violates the first amendment to the Constitution of the
United States which states that "Congress shall make
no law respecting an establishment of religion, or pro-
hibiting the free exercise thereof." Ifl believe that the
best way to serve my land is to lead a humble life
while trying to practice the teachings of Jesus, then I
can- not accede to the secular demands of a system

thatclaims to be able tomake my own moral ide-

usurp the ultimate moral and religious authority of the
individual conscience, it-has no legal validity if Amer-
ican Iaw still upholds freedom of religion. If, on the
other hand, the government arbitarily decides that it will
permit free exercise of religion only when that exercise
seem's convenient for the state, then the true American
patriot must oppose this attempt to divest him of the
right to follow his religious scruples. I will not surrend-
der my life into your hands, nor will I permit you to
determine the nature of my calling.

Secondly, the law demands that an eighteen-year-old

_submit to unjustified intrusions into his personal life

while concurrently withholding from him the right to due
representation in government. The Selective Service Sys-
tem does not derive its unjust powers from the con-

sent of the governed. On the contrary, eighteen-year— I

olds are given no voice in theﬂgovernment that im-
presses them into its military forces. The fact that a young
man faces blunt coercion without those rights of red-
ress supposedly hald by full citizens contradicts the
spirit of American representative democracy. Thus the
Selective Service Act does not have any measure of le-
gitimacy in relation to the body of higher American law.
If the colonists of 1776 would not be taxed without re-

presentation, why should men under twéntyone let the '

government manage their lives without a major part in
the decision making process?

Finally conscription subverts the very ideals that it pur-
ports to uphold by military defense. What freedom does
a young man have under the Selective Service Act?
Where is the proverbial "equality before the law’'
evident in the operation of the Selective Service Sys-
tem? How can a government expect its citizens to re-

frain from using violence when murder and genocide
I are viewed as just means to advance national policy?
._ .( Since war and killing break down morals and the fab-
 - no of a society, why does our land continue on this

futile course of destruction? Has our nation so little
ideological health left that we must viciously strike:
those down. who disagree with us? American can not
bring about a fruition of freedom for the world popu-
lace by using involuntary servitude as the means of
maintaining an aggressive armed force.

I I strongly believe that sharing, sacrifice, unswerving pur-

pose, and fortitude must find a nonviolent expression
in the years to come if we are to come to a world
united in loving brotherhood. To this end, I am leaving
on Sunday, September 29, 1968 to begin studying at
Antioch College. &

I hope that we all can look "for the right to see the
dawn of peace." And may that looking guide us to lead
lives that reaffirm our faith in our fellow men.

Yours for a peaceful world, Stephen Mayo Shaffer ,

Dear Mildred & Friends: ‘

Because love has come to mean something
in my life, love for you all and for my red, black.
yellow, communist and white brothers:

Because I believe you are destroying your
humanity, my humanity and the humanity of all -by
forcing passionate hate on the world in the name of
freedom.

7 Because .I believe you are distorting the whole
meaning of life and putting a non—essential system
before concern- for all humankind.

Because without peace within ourselves and
outside of ourselves, we cannot become men.

Because I believe that standing up radi-
cally for truth will add that much more goodness to
a hungry world:

Because I forgive you; because you do not
know what you are doing.

Because you have been your own victims,
have made concessions and conformed in spite of
your own feelings, in spite of what you thought was
a better good:

Because I put my life on the line trusting that
you will give these words a place of consideration in
your hearts:

Because I believe that you and I need love
and gentleness in our own lives and among ourselves.

Because Jesus Christ died that we may live
with joy in our hearts:

Because I cannot accept the lies that those in
power use to attain their own ends:

Because I believe that this country will be
looked upon as notorious and completely inhuman in

its use of force and its disinterested waste of human lives.

Because you and I must both realize for our
own survival that we are destroying all the good that
men have died for and lived for by our participation
and cooperation with this war and this system:

I give this back to vou with a kiss for our
common humanity. William Davis

George Schumacher,/Isst. U.S. Attorney, April, 1968

Your Honor,

Mr. Kelton has suggested I write to you concerning my
reasons for refusing induction. I'm happy to be able to
do so though it's been quite an undertaking. I've found
it hard to write about something this personal to some-
one I don't know. Also it's been hard for me to concen-
trate Iately--my upcoming marriage andthe tensions
of the trial have seen to that! And finally, I'm not at
ease being formal: speeches and essays both are hard
for me. Nonetheless, I hope through this letter you'll
be able to catch what's gone into my decision.

At the center of my thinking, Your Honor, is the feeling
that it all could have been otherwise--i.e., that my life
is radically contingent. I think it would have been no
less reasonable for me to have been born in any other
country, at any other time, intolany other socio-eco-
nomic group, or with any other set of capabilities, than
to have been born where and nurtured into who I am.
A consequence of this is a tie to and with other peo-
ple--our contingency, at least, we all share. This com-
mon foundation makes taking a life or aiding in taking
a life a crucial matter, for given other circumstances,
I could be any helpless victim. But I do find myself
in a privileged position and I feel it's only right to live
in a way as to share it.

I can't honestly say I'm opposed to all war at all time. I
just don't know. I can't spell out general conditions
under which I could kill or aid in killing, though I can
conceive of situations (like in response to an invasion
of this country by a totalitarian power) where I would
go to war. (This, as you know, is enough to exclude (me
from conscientious objector status.) On the other hand
it's not quite so hard for me to recognize unacceptable
reasons for killing. Your Honor, I feel the war in Viet-
nam falls into thislatter category. I feel that to aid in
the suffering of the Vietnamese people to promote the
stance of the Thieu—Ky government would bewrong.

I couldn't give my life or take others for a regime that
prevents self-determination and denies many of the
freedoms I cherish most as a man, as an American.

I realize that I've broken a law. But, Your Honor, to have
submitted to induction, to have militarily aided, in any
fashion, this war, would have meant to have broken
myself. I dare not do that.

Believe me, Your Honor, I don't get much joy out of my
situation. My life is too full to look forward to prison
with anything but horror and fear; But if that must be

I the consequence of my beliefs, well, (and here's where

talking with you face-to-face would be far better, for
my body's saying this), I'll try to be ready.

In all sincerity,
Marc H. Levin

Never let them

- Brother Darst -

. . .and in the meantime I had been doing a lot of think-
ing. There was that time in September when I almost
did it. I ended up doing a lot of drinking for a few days
because I knew I ought to do it--but I couldn't do it.
I kept telling myself that I really did believe what I was
saying about war and the draft and 2-S deferments and
all that bullshit. If I really did believe, then I had no
business carrying a draft card and thereby supporting
both the draft and the war. I was very normal and lib-
eral about it all and told myself that I'd go along with

the law and work to slowly improve the world. After ,

all, isn't that better than being put in jail where you
can't do any good.

The next time I started asking that question (and others)
was in December: David Harris spoke and how could you
hear him and not think. Then, too, I had my conscien-

2‘.

tious objector form and I was thinking about what an-
swers I was going to give to the questions. The Selective
Service System asks what objections you might have
against war which are due to religious training (as op-
posed to ‘merely’ personal objections). I do have an ob-
jection to war. People who are not willing to kill and or
die are forced to do so. War is not two armies of brave,
strong young men all willing to go off alone, kill only
each other, and not bother anyone else. Well, I did have
an objection, but then again that thought came back
strong. That objection could, indeed must, be raised
against the draft. On‘ Dec. 12, 1968 I participated in a
debate on the subject of ‘ROTC on Campus’-—that did
it. Somewhere between the question period and the
rebuttal I suddenly realized that I wasn't telling myself
anymore that I believed what I was saying——l didn't seem
to need to, I said to myself. 'O.K., It's tonight.’ I left
school and hurried home. Between 11:30 and midnight
I dropped this letter (along with the ‘draft cards) in-
to a mailbox and rushed home to eat a belated dinner
and then subtract a bit of the portion alloted to me
in paradise. ‘

Dear Sirs:

Recently I have come to realize that for a time / have
held an attitude, but not been w/'l/ing to act on it. Par-
tially because of thought about the appropriate answers
to the questions on form SS.S‘- 750, l have come to admit
to myself that my conscientious objection includes
not war alone but includes the draft itself.

Accordingly / can no longer continue to participate in
the selective service procedure.

In accordance / am enclosing my classification notice
and draft card and notifying you that I no longer find my-
self able to participate in any way in the selective ser-
vice system.

LOVE . Thomas D. Burgess

A—few says later I received the infamous and ominous
'Notice of Delinquency.’ Next, a few days later, came a
1-A classification. I didn't want a 1—A. If I didn't want
a 2-S, I certainly didn't want a 1—A.

~ After I got my 1-A classification I went down to the

draft board to make a personal appearance. Of course
not a drop of -blood was to be seen-—none filters back
that far. They push the buttons——other bodies carry the

Vwarheads. We argued about my desire to tape record

the hearing and I lost. In a sense it is logical, consid-
ering that the gentlemen of my draft board were busy
that day drafting young men to protect the freedom’

‘and rights that we all share by killing young men in

the jungles of his country. They didn't have a whole lot
of time to waste on me. I told them that they couldn't
make a judgment on my case unless they knew the
reasons behind my actions, and then I read the follow-
ing statement:

I believe each man is responsible for the things he does.
Whenever a man has a choice of actions he must take
responsibility for all forseeable consequences of the
choicehe makes. By allowing a system that brings
death, killing, insane war, and needless force and vio-
lence to continue, we must all take part of the blame
for these things. If there is no way to remedy these
atrocities by changing the system through /aw proc-
esses, then we must still accept the guilt and strive to
find other means of affecting the system. The 883/5 such
a system,‘ my refusal to be part of that system is such
a means. / have done this unwillingly and with sadness,
but what / do is necessary in conscience.

/ don't want to go against what a lot of people think
to be right. / have done nothing wrong. On the con-
trary, l have refused to do what is wrong. / have refus-
ed to condone, by passive (or is it active?) acceptance,
the killing, or those institutions that allow and foster
it. My conscience would not allow me to have done
otherwise. To say that l have done wrong does not make
it so.

The freedom which the pioneers of this country sought
to institute by forming the United States of America
keeps the majority (no matter how large) from forcing
the minority to kill. I will claim the right to refuse to
commit crimes against humanity.

Then we talked a little and the executive secretary took
notes. She has been sending men off to war in good old
draft board eleven for 22 years. I'm 21. She had prob-
lems writing down one particular sentence. I muttered
to myself that they ought to get a tape recorder.

I look at it like this. I didn't like the idea of going along
with the draft, but I couldn't reach the point where the
displeasure became large enough to bring me to do
what I did. Finally, somehow, I did . . . I just got fed up.

Life keeps going on. The sun comes up each morning,

and I'll live another day. So, I decided, as long as I'm able
to I'll keep living by doing what I think is right and avoid?
ing what I think is wrong. That's about as complicated

as life should be anyway. When you subtract all (or

a lot of) the doublethink and the everyday bullshit things

become a little bit clearer.

A few months short of seven years ago a Marine Corps
Captain presented me with a "Certificate,of Accept-

no enemy, but Peace. I

From the day I landed, Christmas Day, 1965, to the day
eleven months and twenty-six days later when I board-
ed a jet plane to return safely home, I was faced
everywhere with the horror, the violence, destruction and
sheer mechanical brutality of war. But, even this
flaming, exploding baptism, this bloody apprenticeship’

h ‘at humanity's most criminal occupation was not enough——
‘ no, not the tears of ‘orphans nor. the wailing ofrnothers

     

 

holding their dead children, nor the suffering and agony
of old men nor even the gasping, desperate prayer
of a young corporal dying without a priest could sway
me away from the silent obedienceso well ingrained
in a well-trained Marine. ’

,'Tolstoy refers to the act of resisting violence as "an

awakening from madness." For me this awakening from
madness would await the" love of a woman at home,
17,000 miles from the front. It would await the impas-
sioned plea of a professor of history-demanding to
know how many Guernicas. how many‘Coventrys
I had left behind. It would await the agony of
young men entering prison in defiance of consciption
and the cries of an outraged citizenry in the streets.
Only then did the sound of howitzers, ofmachine, guns.
of screaming men echoing from those eleven months
bring me to an awakening from madness.

And so. this evening, October 3, 1968, exactly two years‘

from the clay I left Vietnam I come to affirm a re-.

awakened sense of my responsibility to the lives ofall '

men in all times, to affirm a newer, greater faith in the
goodness of men and in the possibility of a world
community free from the spectre of violence and war,
and to celebrate.the freedom of all men to.determine
their own individual destinies. But yet I come this even-
ing not merely to describe and relate a faith, but to
translate that faith into a positive act. That act is the
severance of all ties thatil have not only with the
Marine Corps. but with the Selective Service System, an

institution which forcesxmen against their will to_parti--

cipate in the murder of other human beings.

My act is based-‘primarily upon the rejection of violence
as a means of resolving individual and_ national ‘dif-
ferences. But it is also an act made by a member of
the university community crying out and demanding.an'

end to university complicity with the war machine. We”

will ask Chancellor Posvar later this'evening why our

own‘~university"must co-operateby providing informa-_

tion to Selective Service boards. Why, Chancellor Pos-
var, hasthe military been given the sanction and op-
portunity to train students foriwar on our campus?‘ I

It is in this spirit that I have asked Monsignor Charles
Owen Rice of the Holy Rosary Churchtoi return my draft
card and the medals I have received to the Comman-
dant of the Marine Corps. I have asked Father Rice
‘to accept: ' A I _' I "’ '

Q my formal rejection of the Selective Service System
becausel feel that what I am doing has a great deal
to do with my relationship to God.

O my classification and draft card I return in the faith
that I can never again bear arms and that I cannot
stay silent while conscription robs men ofitheir freedom,_
their dignity and their lives. ‘‘ ‘

Mrs. Mabel Fearson, co-ordinator of operations
for Baltimore '5 26 draft boards.

The Department of the Army has conducted a series of
studies on the willingness for combat of the American
soldier. These studies support the belief that attitudes and
performances during training are related to performance
in combat. and that the individuals who had the least
satisfactory attitude during training later tended to be re-
latively poor combat soldiers. The result of these studies
also showed that at least 24 per cent of the men said
they would rather not, or felt they could not kill an ene-
my soldier. It is vitally important that the leader in
training be sensitive to the men's attitudes and strive to
build an attitude of confidence intheir combat skills.

We got around to the subject of war again and I said
that, contrary to his attitude, I did not think that the
common people are veryvthankful for leaders who bring
them war and destruction. "Why, of course, the com-
mon people don't want war," Goering shrugged. "Why
should some poor slob on a farm want to risk his life in
a war when the best that he can get out of it is to come
back to his farm in one piece. Naturally the common
people don't want war; neither in Russia nor in England
nor in America, nor for that matter in Germany. That is
understood. But. after all, it is the leaders of the coun-
try who determine the policy, and_ it is always a simple
matter to drag the people along, whether it is a demo-
cracy or a fascist dictatorship or a Parliament or a Com-
munist dictatorship.”

."There is one difference," I pointed out. "in a dem-
ocracythe people have some say in the matter through
their elected representatives, and in the United States
only Congress can declare war."

~"Oh, that is all well and good, but, voice or no
voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding
of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell
them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists
for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to dang-
er. It works the same way in any country." I

America Dreams

In dreams my life came toward me,

My loves that wereslender as gazelles.
But America also dreams . . . ‘
Dream, you are flying over Russia,
Dream, you are falling in Asia.

As I look down the street

On a typical sunny day incalifornia

It is my house that is burning .
And my dear ones that lie in the gutter
As the American army enters.

Every day I wake far away

From my life, in a foreign country.
These people are speaking a strange

language.
It is strange to me V
And strange, I think, even to them.

If man will only realize that it is unmanly to obey laws
that are unjust, no man's tyranny will enslave him.

Truth is like a vast tree, which yields more and more
fruit, the more you nurture it. The deeper the search in
the mine of truth, the richer the discovery of the gems
buried there, in the shape of openings for an ever
greater variety of service.

What do you think? Wherein is more courage required
, --in blowing others to pieces from behind a cannon or

with a smiling face to approach a cannon and be blown
to pieces?

Tedium tends to feed upon drabness and routine, over-.
crowding, upon steel bars and body counts . .
um invites one to stress the unnaturalness of confine-

ment, bureaucratic rulebooks and rigidity, inmate hang-I 

ups and custodial impersonality, moral and political
uselessness, the total climate of futility and waste. No
wonder that prisoners "chalk off" that portion of their

lives believing it barren of anything constructive. Per-

sonally, tedium terrifies me as a kind of deadly abra-~ A 

sive which works on a man's spirit like wind and water ’
on loose soil. The erosion that results becomes common-

place, and very nearly inevitable. To see men of in-
telligence and accomplishment (not uncommon in fed-- x

eral prisons), far more innocent of crime than many of '

our public pillars," lick their wounds and fan their re- 
sentments like punished children, mark time and feast; r

upon distractions. . . is a scene of depressing waste.

I thought. some public personages might speak out pub- '

kept silent would have meant joining those who sup-

therefore today, in my final plea, I ask nothing of
this court. I

then: 

' John Peter Zenger was tried for seditious |ibe|~in I775.

Counsel for the defense advised the jury that "the pub-
lic,,speaking through a jury was not_ bound to en-
force the--la-w as laid down by the judges but should

make an independent conscientious decision whether the

defendant's conduct should be treated as a crime."

HOW‘

I .

‘Richard Boardman explains why he refuses to ‘accept
classification as a conscientious objector:

I had failed to‘ realize" that my deferment as a CO C

was a convenient way by which my resistencetto con-
scription ”and the military (and the resistance of thous-
ands like me) was effectively silenced. / had failed to

_ acknowledge that my claim as a conscientious objector

was on/ygbegrudging/y given to me because my ”cre—
dentials" were good, because I was articulate, because
my education had .rnade_ it easy for me to produce a’

Y convincing defense of my desire to live peaceably and

lovingly.‘ in short, because I fell within a certain small,

‘carefully defined group to whom the government felt

it- was both wise and safe .to give deferments: wise,‘ be-
cause otherwise this small group might raise some em-
barrassing questions about the legitimacy of conscrip-
tion "and militarism,-and safe "because the group is
small enough as to have little influence on the popu-

' /ace at large.

At his trial he doesnot-intend to “enter any facuta|'
defense, but instead plans to assert his right to appeal

A to_the conscience of thejury. _

-. ‘K

The jury is in this system‘ foroccasions like this. ,A'

young —man._who is entirely sincere'has,_m_ade the mis-

takes he did. You mu‘st5decide whethervitis a good thing

. for society and for him to be possibly imprisoned for up .-
"'.to five years on each count." That is your decision.

I ha‘ve‘”m'uI|ed over in my'mind‘m'any times -the question:
"would you 'do”it over again?" The answer has always”
been ’’I don'tVknow." Perhapsl would havejhad less
disdain for some of the procedural niceties and filled

‘outthe unobjectionableparts of th”e"CO question-

naire, leaving the board and the courts with the cons-
titutional objection to the Supreme Being clause as the

"only point of contention. On the other hand,. the more

I participate in and study American society, the more I
am convinced that playing the game with their rules
robs action of its moral and psychological weight.

something is
terribly wrong  

On May 23, 1968, Davis Harris was tried in the United
States District Court in San Francisco. He was charged
with willful failure to submit toinduction into the Arm-.
ed Services. Judge Oliver Carter instructed members
of~the jury to ignore the moral issues involved in the
case. The trial continued for two days. At its end, Mr.’
Heisler, David's lawyer, presented a moving argument
to the jury on David's behalf. The text of it is as follows:

"Judge Carter and Ladies and" Gentlemen of the Jury,

"l was bothered for two long days because lfelt that
there was something radically wrong with this case.
A fragment of a poem went through my mind as I fol-
lowed Mr. Langford (the prosecuting attorney) through
the labyrinth he was trying to present to you. The phrase
that came back to me again and again was "It is done."
Atfirst I thought I must be thinking of the Crucifixion
2000 years ago where it was said that "The deed is
done." But that was not it.

"Yesterday, when I went to my son's home, I saw my
little granddaughter who is seven and a half years ‘old
and I suddenly knew what I had been thinking about.
I asked her for her book “Alice in Wonderland." She gave
it to me and I "found there a fragment of a poem which
clearly describes David Harris’ case. It begins:
"Thus grew the tale of Wonder/and,

Thus s/ow/y, one by one,‘
/ts quaint events were hammered out,

And now the tale is done."

"This case is like a tale from ”Alice in Wonderland" be-
cause I am not defending a person charged with mur-

. der. I am defending a man because he doesn't want to

kill.

"David Harris is charged with trying to live his life in ac-
cordance with the principles his mother taught him. He
believes in the brotherhood of man andlfor that reason
he stands before you charged with failing to carry out

‘an order to participate in an organization designed to

kill. The government demanded that David join this or-
ganization and he could not do it because his mother
and his teachers and many others who influenced him
taught him that there is no exception to the command-
ment "Thou shalt not kill." No one told David that he
should interpret this commandment to mean that ”Thou
shalt not kill unless you are put in uniform and ordered
to do so." And now, because he finds he can not partici-
pate in killing regardless of who insists that he do so.
he is threatened with punishment.

"You members of the jury were all told that when you

were made as human beings, you were endowed with
a conscience. You must live with yourselves and you
know that you violate your conscience at your own
risk. You will be faced with choices and often the path
of least resistance may be to do what you believe to be
wrong. But you will have to face yourselves for the rest
of your lives. David Harris does not want to live with
himself knowing that he participated in the murder of
another human being.

"David did not invent the idea that it is wrong to kill.
Before him a carpenter from Nazareth preached the
brotherhood of man and hewas crucified. I

"Mr. Langford has told you about the law and he was
gracious enough to say that probably sometime in the
future unjust laws will not bind us. The law that the
government tells us David has violated was made by
men. I don't know if it was made by good men, just by

 

Te clear sky, b _
The green fruitful earth is good;
But peace among. men is better.

ordinary men, like all of us. It is possible that they were
wrong in making this law. They have been wrong many

~ times before. In 1816 there was a law which said that

if working men should get together and conspire to ob-
tain more money from their employers, they were guilty
of a felony. People in Philadelphia went to jail because
of this law. Asgrecently as 1963, only five years ago.
state laws in the south made it a crime to mix the races.
And many people were punished because they said
b something was wrong with those laws when the Dec-
laration of Independence said that all men are created
equal‘. 4 ‘
"But an unjust law is not binding on a man of con-
science. 80 itwas said by the carpenter from Nazareth.
He was not willing to follow the dictates of unjust laws.
And Martin Luther posted his edicts on the door of the

' church in Wittenburg against orders from the clergy.

He felt that he had no choice but to act as h i s con-
sc_ience demanded. Neither did David Harris have any
choice on the morning of Jan. 17th. He did not set out
deliberately to violate the law. He simply chose the
course of action his conscience told him was the only
alternative he had. '

"Our constitution begins with a preamble which says in
so many words that the government has no right to
make a law unless that law will advance the general
welfare. Now the government may try to tell you that the
general welfare is being advanced when 550 Ameri-
can boys and 5,500 so-called Viet Cong are being kill-
ed per week. David Harris doesn't believe it. He believes
he must do what is good for the general welfare and he
believes it is\'his duty to tell us that something is wrong.
Something is terribly wrong when people all over the
world allow governments to train young men to kill
each other.

"If you believe David only intended to avoid his mili-
tary obligation, you must ask yourselves why he did
not use his opportunity to be draft exempt. The govern-
ment introduced his Selective Service file into evidence.
It shows-.that he was an outstanding student at Stan-
ford University.. As such he had the right under the law
to obtain a student deferment. But David did not want
to hide behind’ technicalities in the law. He saw his duty
to stand up and say to his fellow men that it is high
time to cease senseless killing of each other. And there
are other ways "David could have escaped the Selective
Service laws without having to violate them. He could
have gone to Canada. He could have become asecond
story burgler or broken some such law which would
have gotten him a felony conviction. The Armed Ser-
vices will not induct a convicted felon and David might
well have gotten a lesser sentence than that which the
government asks for a violator of the Selective Service
laws. '

"The point is that David did not intend to violate or es-
cape the Iaw. He intended to do his duty as he saw it.
He knew that it is wrong to take another man's life
and that it is right to live in peace and brotherhood and
he knew that he would lead his life doing what he be-
lieves is right.

"The court will tell you that it is up to you to decide
that you know beyond a reasonable doubt that when
David Harris did not go into the Selective Headquarters
on Jan. 17th, he intended to violate the law. If you put
this question to yourselves honestly then‘ your answer
must be "No." The government could/not show that
this young man violated the law with specific intent to
be willful about it. Willfulness to violate the law is the
farthest thing from the pattern of his actions.

'’I said to you in my opening statement that we are
not here to prove David is not guilty of the government's
accusation, but the government must prove beyond_a
reasonable doubt that their accusation is correct.

important development took place in the resistance
(ment when Boston's Arlington Street Church grant-
sanctuary to two young men unwilling to serve in
.a_r’.med forces (or as Howard Zinn put it at their press
a r_ence, unwilling to accept "involuntary servitude")
Talmanson, refusing to be inducted, and Bill Chase.

s-faction by the church makes a number of things

relfstrength to the men resisting. The church today
W not offer sanctuary in the literal, the medieval sense;
fo the "modern state does not hesitate to send its offi-
alsjup to the altar to take hold of a man. Dana Greel-

Church makes that community of resisters even more
visible, even more believable.

The New England Resistance called for volunteers to
stay in the church. with Talmanson and Chase in shifts
--ready to interpose their bodies when the‘federal mar-
shals came (to give them " ‘peoples’ sanctuary," as
Father Mullaney of another church, St. Phillips in Rox-
bury, put it). People who agreed with these two men

were given a new way in which to show it--enab|ed'|it-'

erally to gather round them and make that agreement

‘ felt. The more visible the community ofthose resisting

the Warfare state becomes, the more this community
is able not merely to give support to those who have
been moved by conscience, but to attract new men to
join it._Three days after the church gave sanctuary to
Talmanson and Chase therewas a draft—card turn-in
on Boston Common. One young man stepped forward
who had stopped in the church the night before to talk.
He said, "Last night Bill Chase called me his brother.
Unless I actually support the beliefs we both have, I'm
not worthy of that title." In his case it was a sense of
wanting to belong to a new fellowship that seemed
very real to him that brought him to the point of de-
cision. Here is a new stage in the movement.

The church's action makes things a little different for
the government, too. It has become progressively hard-
er for it to pick up the disobedient quietly and without
embarrassment. When it must invade a sanctuary to

I take its man--and seize him from a gathering of those

who honor him--it loses a little more of its legitimacy.

When the government came for Talmanson-—"Ta|ly"~
his comrades sat in_front of, behind, on top of the police

(car into which he had been put by-_federaI marshalls

(limp and holding a volume of Lao Tze). Things stood still
for aboutan hour, and then the police decided not to
make the arrests that everybody had expecte/d, but to
beat people. Two people were sent to the hospital. This
violence brought about a crisis of thought among those

involved. '

The director of the church, Victor Jokel, shocked by the
bloodshed, felt that the attempt at obstruction had been
a mistake, and that only spiritual means of resistance
should have been resorted to. Spokesmen for The,Resis-
tance declared that in the light of the police action they
would have to review among themselves the whole
question of nonviolence. Before this, they had been able
to assume that if they remained nonviolent, the police
would. respond without violence, too. Now they could
nolonger make that assumption. ”Nonvio|ent protest
has two functions--to keep the participants from com-
mitting violence and also to keep the whole situation
from becoming violent. If the second function is lost,
the firstis far less meaningful."

My hope is that all concerned will reconsider their ap-
praisals of what occurred. I would call the action ta-
ken an eminently right "one. It was in the first place
simply a very logical extension of the statement all
were concerned to make to Tally--of our community
with him. It was a way of managing to be with him
that much longer. Jim Havelin, a young poet in The Re-
sistance, wrote a poem immediately afterwards that
communicates the spirit of the action. . . . When I kneel-
ed behind the car and saw his face in the window’ he
wrote love in‘ the back window/of the police car . . 

.It was also a very logical extension of the statement’

all were concerned to make to the government author-
ities: That if Tally didn't want to go, we denied their
right to coerce him. This was a way of making it not
only embarrassing but difficult for them to take him.
One of the Resistance.spokesmen put it very well: "We
no longer feel the need to cooperate at any point . . .
If we can make it as difficult for them as this every
time (that they come to take a man away), it could
change the political complexion of the country." I agree
that it could. But if it could. how can those beginning
to raise such difficulties expect to remain unscathed?
Nonviolence is not a magic spell that ‘one can cast over
the antagonist--the psychological equivalent of one of
the new paralyzing drugs. One of its functions is to
minimize -- in the long run the violence an antagonist
will feel justified in using; but it can hardly be expect-
ed to preven-t retaliation altogether. One of The Resis-

8»(‘

‘,\

tance people declared that the police action had "de-
stroyed nonviolence 'as we have known it." If nonvio-
lence as they have known it--that is, a relatively calm
response to their nonvio|ence—-is likely to become rare

now, is it not precisely because they are beginning to.

challenge the war ~ machine with much more vigor,
beginning to show that they are capable of hamper-
ing it? To have violence come down upon-one when one
is not onself violent is a veryspecial shock. It is also the
classic testing point for one trying this way. If they will
persist in the face of unfair retaliation--persist both in

their disobedience and in their refusal to use violence,

themselves--then, I propose, their nonviolence will be-
come not less but far more meaningful. And that mean-
ing will, in the long run, communicate itself to more and
more of the people who watch their struggle. And their
support will grow. But one doesn't stop a great machine
without anyone getting hurt. And I ask the officials of
the church: Has not violence always come down upon
those trying to be true to the spirit? ‘
--Barbara Deming

The questions which we must ask ourselves seem clear
to me. Does not the question point clearly to what a
church is all about? Does the church not stand as a
bulwark of conscience and religious morality? Is not one
of its functions to be the conscience of the commu-
nity,‘ to hold up a moral barometer to judge public as
well as private behavior? Our purpose is to bring up our
young peo’ple as "people of conscience.” Should we not
be prepared to stand by them in their hourof test-
ing? If there isva price to pay, and make no mistake
about it there will be a price to" pay, should we the
church hold back? . '1

Dissent Rejwvenates Baby Doctor

In 1968. Spock supported Dick
Gregory because “I think you’ve
got to have strenous prosecution
of civil rights and . . . an anti-
imperialistic foreign policy.
Gregory was intent on both of
these."

As for Richard Nixon. Spock
commented. "1 always despised
him. I admit he's handling him-
self smoothly up till now. and I
hope he grows in wisdom."

When asked if he had a theory
of aggression, the pacifist de-
clared, “I think man certainly has
an impulse to expand his power,
as an individual or in groups, if
he can get away with it. What is
more dangerous is man’s self de-
ceptiveness . . . like what the Bri-
tish called the ‘Whiteman’s bur-

Doctor continued. "has never
been more clear than in Vietnam.
. . . It’s all absolutely clear: no
justification, no invitation. no
treaty committment — a pure pow-
er grap which our government
later dressed as . . . interfering

With the immorality of the war
so clear, those who fail to see it
“don’t want to believe we are do-
ing wrong. The majority of Amer-
icans are against the war. not be-
cause it is unjust, but because it
is unwinable, Americans want a

nounced that the Undergraduate
Council has approved a multi—dis-

students interested in almost any
problem related to the urban
scene. The program is designed
to be as flexible as possible and
will be under the supervision of
a committee of interested facul-
ty, students and administrators.

David Bramhall, professor of
economics. has accepted the
chairmanship of the committee.

as instances where we tried other
power grabs. He directed the
blame for U. S. imperialism at
governmentland industry. But it
must be shared, according to
Spock, by Congress,_labor and
press. “All the important institu-
tions in our country are for defin-
ately increasing arms and the
peril of nuclear war.”

“U.S. foreign aid has been used
to control the foreign policies of
other nations.“ Spock asserted.
He cited as proof that the U.S.
enforced trade embargo on ‘Chi-
na and Cuba. Consequently. “The
United States is the greatest im-
perialist nation the world has ever
seen. But most Americans do not
see this; they see us as good na-
tured.

Returning to the issue of de-
cent. Dr. Spock commented on

legislation of the F‘leming-bill-
type. “I think it will increase de-
cent. though students will be cau-
tious letting themselves be iden-
tified. Students are not easily in-
timidated these days. If oppres-
sive measures are unfair. they
will move students out of the con-
servative wing. as at Columbia.”

The mild spoken Spock. who
presented anything but the image
of the outspoken dissentor. was
genuine in desire for free speech.
The member of the older genera-
tion who rose to support youth at
a great personal inconvenience
ended his remarks with a strong
indictment of campus-control leg-

-islation. “This kind of stupid ef-

fort to substitute intimidation for

ECAC Rule On Fresh

by Art Rosengarten
Sports Columnist

/YX/.£/A/‘./7%/‘.£/£//7.€/‘J7£/J.7£/Z/.€/‘./Y/ff/Z/If/.7!

L g One Man’s View §
  Coaches Applaud New

§ .

What appeared as a small news filler in the newspa-
pers, may prove to be a great boost to the athletic situa-
tion here.

The Eastern College Athletic Conference voted to
permit freshman athletes to participate in varsity compe-
tition in all sports except football, basketball, and hockey.
This will allow talented athletes to participate four years
on the varsity level, as compared to the traditional three.

According to Athletic Director Casimir Myslinski,
there was much dissension among the ECAC members
and the vote was far from unanimous. “The bill passed,
but just barely.” he stated. “The big schools were totally
against it, while all the small schools voted for it.” In this
instance, Pitt went along with the smaller colleges and
universities and voted for the bill’s passage. The final vote
was" 74-68. All of the eight Ivy League schools and the
majority of Pitt’s big-time foes voted against the bill.

After canvassing the opinions of most of the coaches
at Pitt, Myslinski still wasn’t sure_ of the way he would
cast his vote on the measure. “I wanted to be sure that I
was doing the right thing,” he flatly stated. “I’m still a
little hesistant to predict what effects will be derived for
this measure in the long run.

“I do see immediate results for the Panther teams.”
he continued. “It should be immediately beneficial for
our teams, most of whom are on the bottom of the totem
pole and could use the added manpower.”

While Myslinski exhibited his pessimistic attitude,
most of the coaches that this reporter contacted expressed
happiness with the new ruling and also a feeling that it
was about time that something like this had been ruled on.

“I think that we’ve got to do what the rest of the coun-
try has been doing,” explained track coach Jim Banner.
“My big concern is that everybody is going to do it now.
It has to be an all or none affair if this thing is going to
work.”

Wrestling mentor Dave Adams agrees with Banner’s
views and extends his thoughts a little further. “Now when
we recruit we can immediately start looking for boys to
fill our void and bare spots in the line-up,” he said. “Even-
tually we hope to go into a junior varsity program and
schedule. After all, the best in the country are using fresh-
men and why shouldn’t we.”

The most enthusiastic of all of the coaches was Bill
Grant, the swimming coach. Grant’s squads constantly

swam against teams which used freshmen. “I think that
it’s great. It is just what we’ve been waiting for,” he ex-
plained. “Most freshmen are ready for varsity swimming
competition. After all, most swimmers reach their peak
years when they are freshmen and sophomores. I wish we
could of had this running in time for last season.”

What the eventual outcome of this decision will be,
only time will tell. But, at Pitt, immediate results should
be seen starting next September.

Goes for Fifth Straight

Winning ‘Fun’ for Paul Allen

by MARTHA HARTLE
Assistant Sports Editor

For Paul Allen, it’s fun to
win—and the junior grappler
from Penn Hillshas been having
quite of lot of fun lately.

After a fairly slow start this
season, Allen has come on to win
four straight matches, and this
Saturday at Lehigh he goes after
his fifth straight, against Frank
Paquin.

"I think my problem at the be-
ginning of the season was one‘ of
mental attitude,” explained the
191-pounder. “Last year, I only
had a couple of wins. I had a de-
featist attitude. But the coach
helped me cure that. What real-
ly snapped me out of it was the
Maryland match this year. I could
have won that match and we only
lost the match by one point.“

Allen hasn’t lost a match since
the Maryland contest and with
only the Lehigh match remaining
on the dual meet schedule, he is
looking forward to the Easterns.

“I’d like to go to the Nationals
this year." explained Paul. “and
to do that. I have to place either
first. second or third in the East-
erns. I have to place and I’m go-
ing to place.” _

Allen has been shuffling back
and forth this season between 177
and 191, but he figures he’ll be

going at 191 in the Easterns and _

hopes it‘ll be to his advantage.
“At 191, I’ll have anadvantage
over the others in speed and con-
ditioning. They’ll have a weight
advantage. but I hope myIcondi-
tioning will pull me through."

In previous matches this season,
his conditioning has pulled him
through and he explains how he's
worn out his opponents and has
won points from his opponents on
stalling.

Allen expects his toughest com-
petition in the Easterns to come
from Bob Rust of Syracuse and
Ed Bannat of Navy. He hasn‘t
faced either one yet this season.
“Rust didn’t wrestle in our match:
he was injured and they were sav-
ing him for the Easterns." Paul
explains.

has his own style and usually wins
his matches by one or two points."
Allen continued.

With a four bout win streak be-
hind him, Allen has gained con-
fidence and a winning attitude.
“It’s giving me the momentum to
keep going,” he added.

 

“Bannat is 3 gpod wrestlen  And besides, it’s fun to win.

JUNIOR PAUL ALLEN goes after his fifth straight win Saturday when

he takes on Lehigh’s Frank Paquin. After a slow start, Allen has come

on to be one of coach Dave Adams’ most consistent performers.

By entering nine wrestlers
into competition and taking
four of the nine weight classes.
Stratford House easily won_ the
dorm wrestling chamzionship last
week up at Trees Hall.

With a total of 57 points. the
boys from Tower A rested a full
19 points above their nearest chal-
lenger. Sutherland Jock House.
which finished with 38. Panther
House regained some of the pres-
tige they lost during the basket-
ball season by hanging in there
with a total of 37. Sutherland en-
teredonly five contestants. and
Panther House. six.

In individual competition. the
120 pound weight class pitted

went to Charles’Greer as two Pan-
thers grappled for champion of

the 150 pound weight class.

Twoforfeits gave victories to
Russell Corsi of Stratford and Ken

weight contest between Joe Spic-
ko of Stratford and Joe Laws of

:picked up a 1-0 victory.

Two pins rounded out the com-
petition with Bob Baierl of Pleas-
ure Palace triumphing over Rich

up their lead all through the sec-
ond half the Playboys won easily.

ords was Claude Joyner who had
