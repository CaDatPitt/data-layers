Revitalized Draft To Be
Approved at Electons

Today, the long argued, long Cmltesied 1;)’-1aWS 01' Si-“dent
Congress are placed before the student body. From beginning to‘end,
and it’s a long way, the requested changes in the present constitution
indicate a decisiveness generally lacking in such august literature.
The group deserves credit. . . ‘

But credit is just a minor thing in itself. The Constitution Com-
mittee presented these proposed changes with a sincere desire that
they» be ratiﬁed by the student body. Full credit to the Com-

inactive.
I The ASS feature of the campus
monthly magazine was voted out
of existence at a Panther-exe-
cutive board meeting on March
23. _

William McElwain, publications
advisor, said that the board felt
the feature was “not in the best
interest of the Panther or the
University.”

By the way of explanation he
added, “The action was not tak-
en because of any protest regis-
tered by IF Council or any other
individual group on campus. The
committee considered the feature
undesirable when it ﬁrst appear-
ed and felt that subsequent stu-
dent and faculty reaction had
been suﬁcicientlys unfavorable to
call for its discontinuance.”

Editor T. A. Parkinson also in-—
sisted the action was not precipi-
tated by outside pressure. How-
ever he said further that he
found “no proof of general dissat-
isfaction” and termed the action
as “simply an advisory dissatis-

faction.”

   

G the world’s leading papers, press

associations, and magazines, Lel1r-
man is noted for his intimate, un-'
biased, detailed accounts of trends
and events in the Far4'East and
Russia.

While serving as director of the
Office of War Information in TL1r-
key in 1942 and 1943, Lehrman
travelled throughout the terri-
tory in the present Russian "orbit
and watched the rise of Russian
power and the spread of Com-
munism. ’ ‘

As a correspondent in the clos-
ing days of the European war, he
was the first accredited reporter

Sixty-three candidates have
been nominated to ﬁll the 25 va-
cancies in Men’s Council.
Regularly enrolled men stu--
dents will go to the polls Monday,
April 19 to choose their repre-
sentatives for the -1948-49 school
year. _
Men’s Council, established in
1936, 1s the_ student governing
body charged with the ‘activities
and welfare of men students.
The council sponsors men’s stu-
dent loan fund, men’s customs and

traditions, Men’s Council book ex-
change, Freshman mixer dances,

and improvement of campus con-

ditions in general.

All candidates nominated for
Men’s Council positions are sen-
iors, juniors or sophomores from
the College, Business Administra-
tion, Engineering, Education and
Mines schools. All had a quality
point average of not less than *1,
and presented petitions signed by
25 men students in the same
school as the candidate.

Eighty-seven, such petitions
were submitted but the number
was reduced to 63 by the nomin-
ating committee of Men’s Coun-
cil.

The constitution of Men's Coun-
cli provides that if more than four
men petition for one "vacancy, the
number shall be cut to four by the
senior members of Council, act-
ing as a nominating committee.

about cheating? They will probably make it
somewhat more uncomfortable for those who
are caught. The committeehas dismissed the
“honor system” as impractical, because we
are not “homoge11eo11s,’7 that is to say, all of
us are not of the same kind. Well neither are
the students of any other school.

Perhaps “honest” is the word the com-
’mittee is looking for. If it is, then there must
be a reason, and that reason is not to be seen
inthe incoming students. The people who
come to this university are no more depraved
or immoral than those who go to others. But
the committee must step delicately, for there
are many sensitive toes in their path; they
-must avoid the real issue. .

are all competing for grades. U
Not many of us are here to lave at the
font of wisdom. VVe are here to earn, or any

1 rate, compile, grades‘ with which to impress

professional schools or prospective employ-

-. ers. And the University caters to our wishes,

2 offering a curriculum designed with .that"’end
E in view. Small effort is made to interest us in
’ the higher learning for its own sake; the Uni-
l, versity judges us by the grades we make, too.
. We cut, sleep in class, and cheat, because we
' care for nothing but the almighty “A”.

Cheating, therefore, is only a symptom.
The man who does not cheat places himself at
aarelative disadvantage, especially here he is
“graded on a curve,” a practice which is not
so reliable as convenient.

Some of ‘the blame for this must fall upo
us, and some on modern educational aims. But
the University is not absolved, even with over-
crowding and the troubles of keeping up the
faculty. A reorientation is needed; the Univer-
sity must put more emphasis on learning and
-less on grades.‘ Then there will be more educa-

-tion and less cheating, and,‘ perhaps, the “hon-

or system’? will work. Right now, though, it’s

i pretty hard to argue with the student who

Pittvstudentis can ‘help make it so by taking
advantage of as many of the meetings ar-

Chapel services, seminars, and informal dis-

 ‘ Track Sifuaﬁon

‘Run Off Map‘
 By Local Scribes
By Bill Veenis

Theso-called track situation at the University
is a product of the mind of too many persons with
ﬁery typewriters. It seems to have become "the
product of entirely too many persons with noth-
ing but a headline at stake.

We have come in for a share of criticism for
printing the original story. We wonder if ‘ it
isn’t the “Let sleeping dogs lie” advocates
who think we were wrong in printing this.
We’ve been -ﬁghting them all year. '

But we do object to the ﬂagrant misquotes
arising from the article which appeared in the
News on March 29. When the misquoting was
made evident, blame was shifted to the News. For
those who care to check this, we have ‘yea many’
copies of that edition for their convenience.

This matter of using other than strict

sources for news is old as far as the newspaper
is concerned, particularly when editorial policy

comes into play. ‘ ‘

The newspaper .which carried the article on
our track situation has been baiting the University
all year. They felt “left out” because they were
unable to crack that athletic report situation.
They were not, as it proved later, as resourceful
as the staff of another Pittsburgh paper.

Since then, Pitt has taken the raw end, so to
speak, on all publicity in that paper. It is amaz-
ing what hurt prides will produce in this news-
paper game.

A similar situation exists with another news’-
paper ‘in - the city which seems to feel that
Pitt is the logical place for the beginning of,
a “red” revolution in this country. Latest to 
fall heir to their vituperative outbursts is
George Abbe, assistant professor of English.
Agree or otherwise with Mr. Abbe, he is not
guilty of many of the statements in this ar-
ticle . . . certainly not of the veiled inneuen-
dos made when the author’s imagination rea.ch- ,

’— es print.

All in all, Pitt is getting more than its share
of trumped up foul publicity. What Pitt will do
about it is a very sensiblelnothing. In the past,
and undoubtedly now, these public harangues
have little more effect than a Woodpecker on the
sides~of the Cathedral.

of ﬁve was named by the elected

Lettermen Say
'Yes' to Report
OustingHagan

The much abused Student-
Alumni Committee has received
unqualiﬁed support from.the Pitt
Lettermen’s Club. It was revealed
this week that the ex-varsity
sports stars reversed a previous
resolution with some concrete ac-
tion at their Smoker, March 25.

After an extended discussion
which lasted beyond 11 p.m., the
Lettermen’s Club voted to accept
the Student-Alumni ’Committee’s
recommendations on the athletic
situation at the University. The
vote was estimated to favor the
resolution by a 34-11 margin.

Both Chancellor R. H. Fitzger-
ald and the Board of Trustees

have been informed of the resolu- ‘

tion. The two key ﬁgures in the
athletic mix-up, Head Coach Wal-
ter (Mike) Milligan and Athletic
Director James Hagan, were pres-
ent at the affair.

Five members of the Board of
Trustees also attended.

Spokesmen for the Lettermen
told the News they did not be-
lieve the recommended athletic
program ‘‘would work if Hagan is
permitted to remain as athletic
director.”

Last fall the Lettermen’s Club
gave Hagan a vote of conﬁdence
until it could be proven that he
was either blameless or respon-
hible for the muddled athletic sit-
uation.

Plans Made
To Streamline
Scholars‘ Day

An old idea with a new twist is
almost as good as something com-
pletely new, claims Bill Catrow.

The old idea, according to Cat-
row, is the traditional Scholars’
Day program. The new twist is
that this year the ceremony will
be interesting to someone other
than the scholars honored.

Working on this theory, the
Scholars’ Day chairman has pol-
ished up the usually dry event,
packing the proceedings into about
45 minutes of the free hour sched-
uled for 11:30, Friday, April 16.

Allowing plenty of time for stu-
dents to get over to Soldiers and
Sailors. Memorial Hall, the stream-
lined program still leaves ﬁve or
ten minutes to get back to the
Tuck Shop before ﬁfth hour class.

Headlining the affair will be
Dr. Solomon B. Freehof, national-
ly famous scholar, speaker, and
clergyman. Prior to Dr. Freehof’s
address, the customary ‘presenta-
tion of scholastic awards will be
made to outstanding Pitt students.

Four solists, a duet, and a .trio will be featured by the Women’s
Choral group in its annual spring concert.
The performance will be held in the Stephen Foster Memorial

Two soloists will appear in the ﬁrst group of religious songs. The
nature. In the popular pieces, the Pitt Singers, a mixed choral group,
duet, trio, and two other soloists will sing compositions of a secular
w‘rwi1l assist the Women’s chorus.

Patricia Vayda, soprano, will
solo on “Agnus Day” by Bizet,
and Thompson Lieper, tenor, will
sing “Panis Angelicus” by Franck.
Natalie Young, soprano, and Ethel
Childs, soprano, will sing “The
Man I Love” and “Summertime,”
respectively.

In a duet, Patricia Vadya and
Muriel Thompson, contralto, will
sing arias from the opera “Mar-
tha.” The trio, comprised of Na-
talie Young, soprano; Dolores
Kelsey, second soprano; and Ele-
nor Ankowski, contralto will an-
nounce their own numbers.

“Now Is the Month of May,”

“Love at My Heart,” and “Holi-
day for Strings” will make up the
Pitt Singer’s special presentation.

Another event is planned by the
Women’s Choral group on April
10 when they participate in an in-

tercollegiate sing with girls from

Mt. Mercy College and the Penn-
sylvania College for Women.

More than 40 Pitt men and
women will practice their orations
and brush up on their log-rolling
today, in preparation for the an-

Conference on Government. The
conference, a Model National Po-
litical Convention composed of

/college students, opens Thursday

in Philadelphia.

. The Pitt delegation, directed by
Chairman Sally-Joy Oleon, and

Education Need
In New Army

‘Never before in history have
Am.erica’S civilian educational in-
stitutions occupied so pre-eminent

a position in the realm of national ~

defense, it was pointed out today
by Colonel John I. Hincke, pro-
fessor of military science and tac-

stics at Pitt.

Recognition of the vital import-

‘ance of civilian educational insti-

tutions is a keynote of the nation-
wide observance of Army Day.
today,‘ April 6.

“The modern Army. must be an
educated Army,” Col. Hincke de-
clared in a special Army Aay
statement. “The day when mili-
tary might was measured in terms
of mere quantity of men and
weapons is gone forever. The
magnitude ande intricacy of mod-
ern warfare demands specialized
training, technical skills, scientific
knowledge and, above all, a na-
tive intelligence on the part of

szthe individual, soldierto a degree

totally u.np.resedented in military
annals.”

The U. S. Armed Forces Insti-
tute currently is administering 198
self—teaching courses in high
school and college subjects to
more than 190,000 men.

In addition to utilizing the tech.-
nical schools and the USAFI, the

.Medical Department, Counter—ln-

telligence corps and 0therbranch-
es of the Army are enrolling in-
creasing numbers of enlisted men
and officers in civilian educational
institutions for specialized courses.

Many Theoretical and Applied Studies
Behind Development of “‘Cordura” Rayon

Stronger, lighter ﬁres made
possible by jeamwork of
Du Poni chemists, engineers,
and physicists

On the surface, the viscose process for
rayon seems fairly simple‘. Cellulose
from cotton or wood is steeped in

NaOH to give alkali cellulose, which is A

treated with CS2 to form cellulose ‘Xan-

thate. Adding NaOH gives molasses- -

like “viscose,” which is squirted through
spinnerets into a coagulating. bath of
acid and salt to form from 500 to 1,000
ﬁlaments simultaneously:

R*-OH + NaOH -——> R-ONa + H30
(cellulose) (alkali cellulose)

3
ll
R-O-C—SNa + H-_>SO4 —-> R-OH + C82 4- NaHS04
(cellulose)

R* "' Coil 702(0H l2

Du Pont scientists were working to
improve on the properties of rayon
made by this process when, in 1.928, a
rubber company asked for a rayon yarn
that would be stronger than cotton for
tire cords. The problem was given to a
team of organic, physical, and analyti-
cal chemists, chemical and mechanical
engineers, and physicists. _

Theoretical and Applied Studies

In developing the new improved rayon,
a number of theoretical studies were
carried out: for example, (1) rates of
diﬂ"usion of the coagulating bath into
the viscose ﬁlaments, (2) the mechan-
ism of coagulation of viscose, (3) the
relationship "between ﬁber structure and
properties by x—rays, and (4) a phase
study of spinning baths.
Concurrently, applied research was
necessary. This proceeded along many
lines, but the main problem was to per-
feet the spinning technique. It was
known that a short delay in the bath
between the spinneret and the stretch-
ing operation allowed greater tension
on the ﬁlaments. Du Pont engineers,

therefore designed a series of rollers ‘

 

a as 1* .the:12 e.

In addition, a textile. ﬁnish‘ was de-
veloped that‘ combined just the right
amount of plasticizing action and lubri-
cating power, allowing the ﬁlaments to
twist evenly in forming the cord; A new
adhesive was prepared to join the yarn
with rubber. New twisting techniques
for cord manufacture were found, since
the usual methods caused loss in rayon
strength. C

Engineering Problems Solved

Chemical and mechanical engineers
were faced’ with the design and opera-
tion of equipment for more than 15
different types of unit operations. Equip-
ment had to operate every minute of the
day, yet turn out perfectly uniform
yarn. It was necessary to ﬁlter the vis-
cose so carefully that it would pass
through spinning jet holes less than

' 4/1000th of an inch without plugging.
Some of the most exacting temperature“

and humidity control applications in
the chemical industry were required.
-Out of this cooperation among scien-
tists—ranging from studies of cellulose
as a high polymer to design of enormous
plants——came a new product, “Cor-
dura” high-tenacity. rayon, as strong as
mild steel, yet able to stand up under
repeatedﬂexing. Today, this yarn is al-
most 100 % stronger than 20 years ago.

"Tires made with it are less bulky and

cooler running, yet give greater mileage

under the most punishing operating

How are new men engaged?

Most college‘ men make their first contact

The pleasant aspect of Art’s

better, in the ﬁeld. Barnes moves

Newspaper Stories
False, Says Wilson

Editor, the Pitt News:
I am writing this statement to defend myself. I defy anyone to

call, me down on what I say, and I am. prepared to defend every
word.

I was asked by a reporter from the Pitt News if I was going
to run for the University this season. My answer was that I did not

think so. My reason was and sti
ﬁict with training.

11 is that my class schedules con-

I have 5:30 classes every day except Thursday and I work
every day from six to eight p. m.

I was also asked how my class
and training schedule conﬂict
could have been avoided. I said
that if I had been given the priv-
ilege of registering prematurely,
which is given football players, 1
could have arranged my classes
properly.

Did Not Hit Olson

I did not say that I was not
running because I was not allow-
ed this privilege. I did not say one
word about the athletic policy at
Pitt or about Mr. Olson, as was
stated in some of the city news-
papers.

I run track because I love to
run, for no other reason. When I
came to Pitt, I came to study a
Pre—Dent course, not to run. I did
not ask anyone for anything and I
did not expect anyone to give
me anything.

I feel that I have been mis-used
either by mistake or purposely by
someone who has an interest in
the present athletic situation here
at Pitt. As I said in my phone call
to Mr. Olson, I don’t want to have
a thing to do with it. It does not
concern me in the least.

Conversation Distorted

The particular phone call that I
made to Mr. Olson also has been
distorted. I did call Mr. Olson
Wednesday before I left to spend
Easter at home in Philadelphia. I
informed him just what state-
ments I made to the Pitt News
reporter.’

I also «told him that I did not
have a thing to do with the ar-
ticle written in city newspapers
about dissatisﬁed action towards
him and the athletic policy.

I did not apologize to Mr. Ol-
son or anyone else because 1
had not the slightest reason to

‘ apologize for anything that I said.

Wilson Is Eligible

In regards to my_ eligibility, I
am eligible to participate in track
in every respect. I still have three
years of collegiate eligibility re-
maining and I am scholastically
eligible. If anyone has any doubts
about this, there are records at the
University to prove my status.

In conclusion, I might say that
I don’t know just what an athlete
has to do to enjoy his sport when
a situation such as this arises. It
is a pity that stains such as these
should fall on a grand sport like
track. v

Barnes Hopes
For Big Year

(Continued from Page 6)
Even if Barnes never turns pro,
however, he will have had a taste
of major league ball. While a Navy

pilot at Chapel Hill, North Caro-
lina, Barnes played along side
Buddy Hassett, ex-ﬁrst baseman
of the Dodgers, Braves, and Yan-
kees.

“We played against the Army

North Carolina,” said Art. “They
had a couple of guys you might

Trippi. .

“But the biggest gang of major
leaguers that I met was the Great
Lakes Naval Training Station
team. At that time I was playing
for the ‘Bunker Hill navy team,
but we weren’t much in the way
of opposition for the Lakes club.

“They had Taft Wright, Bill
Baker, Billy Herman, Mickey
Cochrane, Schoolboy Rowe, and
Si Johnson. Johnson, the former
Philly pitcher, worked against us
and beat us, 6-1.

“We got only four hits, two of

singles but I guess they gave me
my biggest thrill in baseball.”

Barnes is hoping for a 1948 col-
lege season that will be more like
the 1946 term, in which he batted
a lusty .434. “Last year my sched-
ule prevented me from getting
batting practice everyday,” Art
explained. “That could have at-
tributed to my weak hitting.”

doubtedly will be happy to settle

Win IM Swimming Meet
By Bob Van Atta
The Phi Gams and Allegheny Alumni led team tallying in the
fraternity and a_ll-campus intramural swimming meets at Trees
Gym‘pool. Both were victorious after close races for team cham-

pionships.
Bill Raney, one of Carl Olson’s¢

leading track men, featured the
All-Campus swim meet, setting a
new IM record in the 60-yard
individual medley of 37.2 seconds.

Raney also ran away with the
diving event.

His efforts in behalf of the Phys
Ed 22 team pulled the Phys Ed
aggregation up_to second place,

three points behind Allegheny-

Alumni’s 29-point total. The Col-
lege Sharks scored 24, with the
Electrical Engineers in arrears
with eight.

The fraternity competition saw
Paul Goodwin pacing the Phi
Gams with a double win, scoring

ﬁrsts in the 40-yard breaststroke
and the 60-yard individual med-
ley.

Other ﬁrst place winners in-
clude: Bill Edgar, Delta Tau Del-
ta (100-yard free-style); George
Treusch, Sigma Chi (40—yard free-
style); Malcolm Hargraves, Phi
Gains (40-yard backstroke, Phi
Eps (80-yard free-style relay, and
Delta Tau Delta (160—yard. free-
style relay). '

Finishing behind the Phi Gams’
44 points were Phi Eps—37,_ Delta
Tau Delta—24, PiKA—23, Sigma
Chi—l5, Phi Delts—-9, Lambda
Chi—6, and Theta Chi-—-5.
