600,000

Activists march for women's right to choose

By Brendan Kevenides '
Senior Staff Writer

University of Pittsburgh stu-
dents participated in what was
the largest pro-choice abortion
rally in U.S. history.

The march, which ran from the
all area of the Washington

 

 

Monument to the front lawn of
Capitol Hill, was held in protest
of the Supreme Court's decision
to hear a Missouri case on April
29 which could overturn the
1973 Roe vs. Wade decision
legalizing abortion.

Diane George, a member of
Pitt's chapter of the National Law-

VOLUME EIGHTY-THREE, ISSUE ONE HUNDRED TWO

dent, estimated that the university
was represented by 320 people.

She said that Iawyers and future
lawyers have a special interest in
protecting abortion rights.

responsibility to uphold people's
rights under the Constitution be-

Pro-life advocates choose to coun terdemonstra tee 

By Scot Ross

News Editor

WASHINGTON, D.C. — There
was an overwhelmingsense of
joy and unity among the estimat-
ed 600,000 who marched from
the Washington Monument to
Capitol Hill yesterday, supporting
the right‘ of women to have
abortions.

Pittsburgh's Anne Feeney took
the stage adjacent to Constitution
Avenue, singing political folk bal-
lads promoting women's rights.

Since the 1973 Supreme Court
decision of Roe vs. Wade, the
pro-choicers have been standing
up for the rights the case gave

     

 

  

an affirmation of the landmark
decision, and marchers chanted
that ”never again” would be the
days of illegal, back-alley,
abortions.

Rumors persisted that ‘a clash
with pro-life advocates was immi-
nent; however, the few hundreds
who appeared were shielded by

‘ District police who wanted to

avoid any violent conflicts. A
Police refused to allow report-
ers access to a group of theme-
lifers who gathered along Consti-
tution Avenue. One officer ex-
plained that he was not going to

allow ”some reporter” to go in

there, ask an offending question
and get ”his head bashed in.”

carrying a sign that said Abor-
tionist.-_ 150 bucks and I ’m at your

cervix, a counterdemonstrator -

said he was in attendance ”to
offer an alternative viewpoint. If
people can come out here for the
right to kill, then I sure as heck
can stand here for the right to
save lives.”

Identifying himself as ”James”
with a Ph.D., the man said that
outlawing abortions would not
cause a situation where women
would lose the right to their own
bodies. He shouted, ”It’s not [a
woman's] body. The baby has a
body. It's a complete, separate

,entity. Don't you know anything

about medicine?

cause we know the law. I also be-
lieve that the law must be good
for something,” George said.

Gwene Harris, also of the NLG
at Pitt, said she was excited to be
a part of the march but was dis-
traught over the lack of backing
her organization received from
the university.

 

her body,” he said, ”but it's not
her body that's growing there.”

James credited the lowering of
women's morals through abor-
tion as a cause for the increase in

«infanticide and child abuse.

At this point he turned his sign
around, revealing animosity
toward the National Organiza-
tion for Women. Printed on the
back of the sign in bold letters
was: NOW’s gifts_to women —

Abortion, AIDS, Herpes, I V.D., ,

Lesbianism.

Notwithstanding the efforts of
the pro-life minority, the march-
ers reached their destination
w_ithout any major incidents.

Soviet sub did not release radiation, tests say

OSLO, Norway (AP) — Prelimi-
nary laboratory tests showed
nothing to indicate that a nuclear-
powered Soviet submarine
released radiation after it caught
fire and sank, Norwegian scien-
tists said yesterday.

Early results of tests for radioac-
tive contamination in air and sur-
face water samples from the
accident area showed no radia-
tion from the sub, the govern-
ment's Institute for Radiation
Protection said in a statement.

”These tests checked to see if
the Soviet sub released radiation
on or near the surface of the
ocean, but cannot exclude the
possibility of such a leak deeper
in the ocean,” said researcher Per
Strand of the institute.

He said the tests will continue.
They involve examining scrap-
ings from Norwegian Orion
reconnaissance aircraft that flew
in the region immediately after
the accident Friday and seawater
collected near the site.

A Norwegian research vessel
on Sunday will take new samples
from deeper waters to assess the
possibility of the sub having emit-
ted radiation as it sank toward the

BUCKETS

seabed, Strand said.

Activists die in clash
with Soviet soldiers

MOSCOW (AP) ~ Soldiers
charged thousands of protesters
in the Georgian capital early
yesterday, and at least 16 people
were killed in a crushing melee
of clubs, shovels, sticks and
stones, official sources and ac-
tivists said.

”They threw themselves on our
people like beasts, and our peo-
ple couldn’t do anything,” said
Leda Archvadze in a telephone
interview from Tbilisi, capital of
the southern republic that lies on
the Turkish border.

The official Tass news agency
said a curfew was in effect Sun-
day night. Residents flew black
flags in mourning, troops and
tanks reportedly patrolled the
streets and activists called for a
general strike.

Police ’crush’ mob

with Scarfo sentence 1

PHILADELPHIA (AP) ~ The
bloody rule of mob boss Nicode-
mo ”Little Nicky” Scarfo, punc-
tuated in eight years with 25
gangland murders, finally was
crushed in a courtroom.

”We crushed the. myth of mob
invincibility, and it is now in as
much disarray as you'll ever find
a mob family,” said Louis Pichi-
ni, of the U.S. Organized Crime
Strike Force here who last fall
convicted Scarfo and 16 Mafia as-
sociates in a federal racketeering
case that included nine murders.

The 60-year-old Scarfo is the
first Mafia chief ever to hear the
verdict of first—degree murder.

Scarfo’s seven co-defendants
also were found guilty of first-

degree murder in the assassina-
tion of out-of-favor gangster,
Frank ”Frankie Flowers”
D’Alfonso.

All eight were sentenced to life
imprisonment.

Escapees returned to
their cells by police

NEW CASTLE, Pa. (AP) —
Authorities searched yesterday
for five of seven prisoners who
escaped the Lawrence County Jail
by cutting a hole in the metal ceil-
ing of their cell.

Two of the men who had es-
caped were back in jail yester-
day. Dan Wilson, 21, turned
himself in at 4 p.m. Sunday and
William Brothers, 28, was cap-
tured at 9:30 p.m. Saturday,
about an hour after the escape,
authorities said.

A New Castle policeman on
routine patrol spotted Brothers on
a city street. The officer arrested
the man and returned him to the
jail, where officials discovered six
others also had escaped.

Pittsburgh mayoral candidates
Tom Flaherty and Byrd Brown
criticized city police manage-
ment while candidates Tom Mur-
phy and Gary Henderson offered
plans for economic development
in city neighborhoods during a
debate at the University of Pitts-
burgh last Thursday.

The debate, titled ”The Other
Pittsburgh,” addressed "areas of

concern — areas not often
desired to be discussed,” accord-
ing to Dr. David Epperson, dean
of Pitt's School of Social Work.
‘Incumbent mayor Sophie Mas-
loff, who has agreed to only two
debates before the election, was
not present at the forum. Also
missing was candidate Frank Luc-
chino, who is suffering from a

to speak at the debate.

What chairpeople are terming
the most successful Pitt Greek

weekend“ with the Greek God

and the dance marathon.

”The attendance was really up
this year. Spirits were higher, and
Greek Week wasn't as competi-

executed smoothly; our chairpeo-
ple did a great job,” said chair-
woman Kristen Puntureri.

’’It was a lot more fun than last

’’I think that it's definitely been
the most monumental Greek
Week in [terms of] achieving our
goals,” said Ron Bizick, Greek
Week chairman.

What is the primary

function of a college?

A university is defined in Webster's II New Riverside ’

University Dictionary as ”an institution of higher learn-
ing, having facilities for teaching and research.”

Last week, the senior vice president of medical and
health sciences, Thomas Detre, called for the resigna-
tion of Jerome Martin, dean of the School of Health
Related Professions.  .

The connection between these two facts may not be
readily apparent. The link becomes more obvious with-
in the context of a quote from Detre on the matter of
Martin's resignation: ”Martin has done a good job of
moving the school forward in many areas, but an aca-
demic researcher should take his place.”

With Wesley Posvar’s proposed tuition increases forc-

ing University of Pittsburgh students to spend even more _

money for the education they are trying to receive, it
seems one school, at least, is going to shift its focus more
toward researching — and away from learning. While
research is vital to society, the university community
is made up of a vast majority of students who are pay-
ing plenty of money for an education. A breakdown of
our tuition showing how much money will fund
research and how much will be spent on improvements
to our academic atmosphere is desirable. Improved sa-
laries for teachers, renovation of classrooms and
libraries, and the creation of new study and computing
facilities are areas that will yield the most benefits to
the suppliers of tuition money: the students.

a For us, as Pitt students, an ”institution of higher learn-
ing” must put teaching before research. Whatever the
purpose of a university is ultimately, we are paying for
an education, and that education is already endangered
by the underpaying of professors, the lack of quiet study

(places, language comprehension problems with T.A.s

and the overcrowding of computing labs. The ”Cam-
pus of the Future” project has yet to expand to anything

remotelyresembling the entire campus. A seasoned and ‘

experienced dean,- who began as a tenured professor,

is to be replaced by an ”academic researcher.” And tu-E T

ition is going up again...

Whatforeign policy?

Mikhail Gorbachev‘, visiting London for talks with British
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, commented through a
spokesman Thursday that the Bush administration's delay in
presenting a foreign policy was a threat to the progress made
in superpower relations recently. There was a fear that the
influence of past leaders in superpower relations, such as
Henry Kissinger, was seen in a subtle willingness to ”inter-
pret Soviet-American relations in terms of confrontation.”

There is really very little excuse for the current lack of a
foreign policy. It is a commentary on the '88 election ex-
posing how the issue was not dealt with during the campaign.
Considering Bush's experience as vice president, he should
have had the time, experience and motivation to have de-
veloped a coherent policy a long, long time ago.

PERSPECTIVES ON ABORTION:

By _Matt Martin

Before he ever had aspirations of

becoming the best diver in the
world, Greg Louganis had another
obstacle to overcome: dyslexia.
-- Louganis couldn’t read a sentence
without it becoming a garbled mass
of letters that made no sense. Class-
mates teased him unmercifully. But
he sought help and overcame his
problem.

Louganis, who went on to win four
gold medals in the Olympics, is also
adopted. His classmates may or may
not have known that. But if they did,
he might have taken some ribbing
at their ‘hands: "Somebody didn’t

_care about you. Somebody threw

you away.”

To the contrary, someone cared
very much. Someone carried him for
nine months, went through child-
birth, and gave him up to an adop-

tive family that cared as much as the ,

birth-parents.
In the blink of an eye, Louganis
could have been aborted. The family

n he knows now might neverhave had

the chance to ‘have a child of their
own. And the dreams andidesire that
drove Louganis into the spotlight
and the hearts of Americans would
never have been realized.

Whﬂe pro-choice groups rallied to
protect Jegaliied abortion in
Washington, D.C,_, on-—Sunday,, ar-

guing the point that".'ia’woman has _
the right to have an abortion, thou- A

sands upon thousands of couples un-
able to have children of their own
agonized overthe possible decision
of the Supreme Court, which will
hear Webster vs. Reproductive
Health Services and either restrict
abortions or let current abortion
legislation stand.

According to Kate Muller of the
Children's Home of Pittsburgh,
there are 100 infertile couples for
every healthy, white infant.

For most of these couples, legal
adoption is the only way that they
will ever have a child of their own.
And with a rumored seven-year
adoption waiting list ‘(I8 months to
two years at CHP), the opportuni-
ty may present itself only once.

On the other side of the issue
stand the left-wingers who. believe

PART 1 OF 3

that they have the right to deny life
to a child, even after conception.
The law upholds that decision right
now. It shouldn’t.

These pro-abortion fanatics have
argued for years that they cannot
have children because of economic
difficulties; because of career oppor-
tunities that a baby‘ would compli-
cate; because it just isri’t the right
time in life.

If money is the issue, then the Na‘-

which organized the rally, is as

_ hypocritical an organization as they
come.

NOW states, "Some women, the
fortunate few with significant finan-
cial resources, were [before Roe vs.
Wade] able to go to one of a hand-
ful of states where abortion was le-
gal, or to a foreign country where
the procedure was legal.”

They certainly were fortunate. Af-
ter all, why would a woman want to

bring a child into a world where he
' or she could be ﬁnancially sound and

secure when he or she can be abort-
ed and forgotten instead? Why?

abortions involve unwed mothers,

‘afraid that someone will discover

that they had premarital sex.

And, at least at CHP, for every

Much easier to take the life offan

society.

Much easier to snuff out the un-

I don't worry about Ollie North

(most of whom don't read the

HONG KONG — "The season
opens again in April,” says
Michael Harmon, Hong Kong's
coordinator for refugees. He is
not speaking of wild game or fish,

‘but of another deluge of Viet-

namese boat people on one of
the world's most densely popu-
lated cities.

Fourteen years after the first
boat people risked their lives in
pursuit of freedom, the second
largest influx of refugees could
come this year. After fairly steady
declines since the record 66,000
who arrived here in 1979, more
than 18,000 came in 1988,
despite a much tougher policy by
the Hong Kong government.

A major reason for the con-
tinued exodus from Vietnam is
the waffling of the Hong Kong
government over the way the
refugees are treated. A closed
refugee camp policy was institut-
ed in 1982, requiring all refugees
to remain in the camps until they
could be sent to other nations.
The average camp stay was three
years.

Now, the government is re-
opening the camps, allowing in-

freedom fighters.”

"What a heroic thought.-I'll
carry the sales slips to Switzer-
land in my bra.”

"How much do you think the
president should know about
what l’m doing, Dawn?”

"Just enough so that if you get

there is virtually no support for
the . refugees among local
residents.

Last year, Hong Kong institut-
ed a screening process in which
only those who could prove they
had been politically repressed
would qualify as refugees. People
whose sole purpose in fleeing
Vietnam was to better their eco-
nomic lot would be sentback. In
addition, a new repatriation pro-
gram is under way, complete
with a video presentation (as if an
edited tape could change minds
hardened by reality), in which the
refugees are encouraged to return

Military people don't do that any
more. I can't wait to write a book
about my role in all of this."

"Dawn, we have to find some
shady munitions dealers to act as
go-betweens.”

"That won't be hard to do, Sol-
ly. I'll let my fingers do the walk-

this, then I'm going to need more
burn bags."

have accepted the offer.

Faced with such overwhelming
odds against finding a new home
even if they survive the ‘rigors of
the high seas and refugee camp
life, what prompts so many to pay
large sums of money to syndi-
cates in Vietnam which, in ex-
change for gold, will help them
to escape? ’

The answer came in a conver-
sation I had at the crowded Sham
Sui Po camp in the center of
Kowloon with Vu Throng, who
escaped Vietnam a year ago. A
writer, Vu says the government

- would not let him write the truth

about his country. Vu says the
average Vietnamese works be-
tween 18 and 20 hours per day,
for a salary of a little more than
$1 per month. Life is very
difficult, he says, and there is vir-
tually no hope that it will
improve. ‘

While repatriation for people
like Vu remains voluntary, there
are ominous signs that Hong
Kong's government may become
more aggressive as 1997, the year
of the city's return to Chinese

North's mistake was that he wait-
ed too long. Now he is in court
fighting for his life."

"Which lawyer do you want
me to call?"

"Any one, as long as he is not
a potted plant."

"Just think, Solly, now there are
so many people who don't even
know your name, but who will
worship you someday."

"Even though I was just follow-
ing orders."

"Because you were following
orders. What man can say no to
the president of the United
States?"

"Dawn, I think you're putting
too many papers in the hem of
your skirt — they keep bulging

control, approaches. The Chinese
have already said they want noth-
ing to do with the Vietnamese,
and the British have no intention
of granting U.K. citizenship to
these residents of their colony.
Forced repatriation ought to be
out of the question for free soci-
eties, but The Economist maga-
zine reports that some
governments at last month's Ku-
ala Lampur meeting on refugees
talked of bribing Hanoi to take
back its own people. While Viet-
nam is officially opposed to the
suggestion, at least one top Viet-
namese official has said Hanoi
might be willing to listen to the
proposal if it would help the
country's cash-starved economy.
The United States has done
more than its fair share, taking an
excess of 800,000 people from
Indochina. Britain has accepted
only 10,000. More_ depressing
than the often poor refugee camp
conditions would be for the free
world to turn its back, claiming

Keeping college an affordable experience at any price

Come this April 30, Iwill have
completed six semesters at one
university or another. During this
time, I have been nurtured by the
motto "Necessity is the mother of
invention.”

During these three years, I have
done things to cut costs that I

. hope I'll never have to doagain

once I graduate.

I guess you could subtitle this
column "How to go through col-
lege on only 99 cents a day."
Here are some tips:

0 Don't buy different types of
soaps and detergents when one
brand will fit all. Upon arriving
in late August, my sole soap item
was the 50—pound "El Grande"
size box of concentrated All —
"fights even the toughest stains."

For the past seven months, I've
not only washed my clothes with
that miracle soap, but my dishes
as well. Hell, to tell you the truth,
I've carted that box into the
shower with me and used it as fa-
cial soap and even shampoo.
Outside of a rash and some dis-
creet hair loss, l’m fine.

Toothpaste is another applica-
tion. Although All won't prevent
tooth decay, neither grass stains

nor plaque will stand a chance on
your bicuspids.

0 Speaking of cleaning, here's
how to save money in the laun-

dry room. When you are about to

dry your clothes, wait until some-

 

OLIVERIO

one puts his clothes in the dryer,
then leaves. Once the coast is
clear, put his clothes in an unoc-
cupied dryer and place your
clothes in the pre-paid machine.
It works every time.

0 Major budget expenses for
the undergraduate can usually be
found in the entertain-
ment/food/clothes troika.

Although these categories are
cumbersome on a student's

budget, there are ways to.

minimize their impact.

First, all students should get the
19-meals-per-week food plan.
When you're starving, everything
tastes OK. Also, this allows the
student ample opportunity for ab-
sconding with various entrees
and side orders. On a given day
I can leave with a plate of
spaghetti, plum quiche, an entire
ice cream machine and four
cafeteria women.

Next is entertainment and
clothing. Both of these categories
can be satisfied simply by going
to a lot of rock concerts. For ev-
ery concert you attend, buy that
rock group's T-shirt. Seven con-
certs, seven shirts — hey, that's an

‘entire new wardrobe worth a

week of dress.

Buying any alcoholic beverage
will also satisfy the two-for-one
category of entertainment and
food. Oh sure, beer is a liquid,
but inside the beer are malts and
hops and other grainy substances.

V ,If_you feel that you must

splurge on real food and go to a
fast-food place, then don't leave
empty handed. Ask _for an extra
"to go” bag and stock up on nap-
kins, and packages of’ ketchup,
salt, pepper and, of course, relish.
You'll never know when they
will come in handy. .

0 Well, that takes care of the
necessities. Now how about the
luxuries of campus life —Wchew-
ing gum, for example. I've
learned through experience that
one stick of Big Red gum will re-
tain its flavor for a full three
months if left on the bedpost.

Grape-flavored Bubble-Yum, it
has been documented, will fer-
ment into wine after 4‘/2 months.
The bouquet leaves much to be
desired but the alcoholic content
is there.

0 The dating game is the black
hole of expenses, sucking up
money from all corners of your
savings. However, if your date is
a true pal, then he or she should
understand the situation. A roll of
cherry Life-Savers and some good

conversation should be ample I, A

fun for a date. .
0 The final solution - to the.

money problem is to (gasp!) find  
a job. You'd be surprised at the ' ' ‘
absurd ways that you can make . __
money. For instance, can you ac-.. j; .,

tually believe that I was paid over
$6 just to take up 20 inches "of
blank space? " .

There were approximately 400
colleges and universities
represented at the march.

Organizers of the march, who
hired professionals to census the
crowd, est.imated that over
600,000 people participated.
Police estimated approximately
300,000.

The last major gathering of pro-
choice groups in Washington,
D.C., in 1986 drew a crowd of
about 100,000, according to
Jeanne Clark, national chairwom-
an for reproductive rights for the

National Organization for
Women.
Officials at the march estimat-
ed that 200-300 anti—protesters
were present. The two groups ex-
changed strong words but were
separated by police on horse-
back. No incidents of violence

were reported.

Some of the pro—|ifers present
set up a symbolic ”Cemetery of
the Innocents” on the Mall. The
4,400 crosses in the cemetery
represented the number of chil-
dren they believe are killed daily
by abortions.

” ’Choice’ and ’Pro-Life,’ that's a
lie. You don't care if women
die.”

Harris said that when she
passed the pro-lifers, she tried to
ignore them. She commented,
however, that theirs is the im-
moral stance.

Refering to the blocking of
abortion clinics by pro-life group
Operation Rescue, Harris said,
”They’re trying to break the law

while we're trying to preserve it.” .

Pro—|ifer James L. Cox of the
Washington, D.C., area said that

"he came to protest the march be-

cause he feels it is his duty under
God. _ '

”These people are advocating
murder,” he said. ”Life begins at
conception. And that's a fact. It
is my responsibility to point this
fact out to the _ people here
today.”

Cox said that he was not wor-
ried by what he estimated as a
500,000-to-I ratio of pro-choice
to pro-life protesters.

Brown said.

However, many businesses fail
in these areas because of high
crime rates. ”City police have got

to act.  They aren't enforcing .

the law in these high-crime
areas,” Brown said.

Flaherty agreed with Brown,
saying that the next mayor needs
to have better cooperation be-
tween city government and the
police force.

”Right now, the police force is
at an all-time low. Morale is shot
on the force. [The next mayor]
has to have a kinder, gentler rela-
tionship with the police depart-

ment,” he said.

Murphy said that the most im-
portant factor in bringing eco-
nomic development to the-city is
mass transit between Downtown
and the airport. He said that as a’
state legislator, he has worked to
force Pittsburgh's Port-Authority
Transit to be more innovative.

Murphy told the college stu-./
dents in the audience to help
fight against the problems caused
by poverty and crime. ”Be rev-
olutionaries,” Murphy said. ”If
you see something wrong, say,

Who is really in charge here?

There is a problem with profes-
sional sports. A problem that goes
beyond drugs, beyond crime and
beyond the threat of nuclear war.

Well, OK, maybe not, but it
still is pretty damn bad. The
problem I’m addressing is the
way things are run. The NBA and
the NHL seasons are a little too
long, and the regular seasons in
both mean nothing.

7 Mike Richter, making his NHL

debut, and the Penguins defeat-
ed the New York Rangers 4-3
Sunday night, completing a four-
game sweep of their Patrick Di-
vision semifinal playoff series.
Mario Lemieux beat Richter, a
former U.S. Olympian, on a pow-
er play at 7:27 and a goal to Bour-
que just 26 seconds later.
Lemieux swept in a shot from just

3 outside the crease and Bourque

scored from the low slot on a
passout from John Cullen.
' In winning their first playoff ser-

‘ ies since 1979, the Penguins ad-

vanced to. the division finals

ta and Orlando, neither of which
will make the '90 playoffs) and is
talking about expanding the
length of the season.

During the NHL regular sea-
son, teams play 80 games, and all
but eight teams make the
playoffs. They start in November
and play until May. There has
been recent talk that the NHL is
going to expand.

All this sounds a little
ridiculous. Too many games, too
much overlapping in seasons and
not enough meaningful games.
Maybe these leagues should take
a cue from major league baseball
and the National Football
League. -

Hockey is beyond help, so it
doesn't really matter.

Baseball plays 162 games. The
top four teams make the playoffs.
Most games in September are just
as meaningful as those in April,
the only exception being when
the teams that don't have a
chance of making the playoffs
play each other. Still, for those ci-
ties, the games are important.

The division winners make the
league championship series and
the winners of these make the
World Series. If a team can win
its division after 162 games, it
must be considered one of the
best.

The only way that the baseball
season can be improved is by fi-
nally starting interleague play.

-- One way of doing this without

extending the season would be to
cut down on games played
against division foes by six (each
team now plays 18 division
games).

Then teams can play one of the
divisions in the other league three
games at home and three games
away. It would add even more
excitement to the season.

The NFL plays 16 games (by far
the shortest of any major profes-
sional sport). Six division winners

and four wild card teams make"

Bergeron was fired with two

The NBA isn't playing the perfect game and should think about a few changes.

champion in five weeks; then it
is pretty much forgotten until the
following September.

‘A team plays everyone in its di-

one of the divisions in the other
conference, and fills out its
schedule with a selection of other
teams. A good system — a little
too short, but that will be worked
out when they start expanding.

that it would most likely be into
the second round of playoffs by
now. The finals would be just
around the corner. ‘ .
But there is a problem’ tha

would arise from this. CBS tele-
vises the NBA playoffs. CBS also
televises the NCAA tournament.
The playoffs and the tournament
would conflict with each other.
More_ people would watch the
college game, so the advertising
dollars would be there.

A The ratings would go to the

NCAA because most people find
the college game more exciting.
The NBA would lose out in the
end, so the season can't end
there.

It can't end now because the fi-
nals would run right up against
the NHL’s Stanley Cup Champi-
onship. Granted, the NBA
wouldn't lose money by doing
this because the only place some-
one can watch the NHL is on
ESPN. CBS would probably get

memorable misses in golf history.

With daylight running out,
Hoch had an even shorter putt for
par, which would have won it
outright on the first playoff hole.

After stalking it from every pos-
sible vantage point, he pulled it,
the ball lipping out. It matched
Faldo’s earlier bogey, and they
went to the next playoff hole,
where Faldo rolled in the long
one.

Both drove the fairway in the
drizzling rain. Faldo went for the
pin, ignoring the pond on the left
of the 11th green. He got it about
25 feet below the hole.

Hoch put his approach to the
right, with the ball skipping off
the sodden putting surface and
running down an embankment.

He chipped up to about six feet
and had that left for par when Fal-

Easy Goer early favorite for

By John Nadel
AP Sports Writer

. ARCADIA, Calif. — Easy Goer

.figures as a solid favorite in next

month's Kentucky Derby, and
deservedly so. But Charlie Whit-
tingham, who trains Sunday Si-
lence, has precedence on his
side. ‘

’’I’m not afraid. I might get
whipped, but I'm not afraid of
anything,” Whittingham said af-

terhis colt’s 11-length victory in"

the $500,000 Santa Anita Derby
over Flying Continental. ’’It’s no
use worrying about Easy Goer. I'll
leave the worrying to Hancock.”

That's a lot of worrying for the
colt’s owner, Arthur Hancock.

Easy Goer, the future—book
favorite in the Kentucky Derby,
won the Gotham Stakes by 13
lengths on an extrememly fast
track at Aqueduct, setting a track
record of 1:32 2-5 for one mile,
just 1-5 of a second off the world
record.

And the colt, whose next start '

will be April 22 over the same
track at Aqueduct, hardly had to
try. I

”What do you think he would
do if I asked him to run?” asked
jockey Pat Day.

But Whittingham, who turns 76 .

Thursday, got his own great per-
formance from Sunday Silence,
one that will be hard to match if
he duplicates it in the May 6 Ken-
tucky Derby.

The winning time of 1:47 3-5
on a fast track was just three-fifths
of a second off the stakes record
set by Lucky Debonair in 1965
and matched by Sham eight years
later. Lucky Debonair went on to
win the Kentucky Derby.

His winning margin was the
largest ever in the race for 3-year-
olds. The previous best was eight
lengths by Majestic Prince in
1969 and Affirmed in 1978. Both
horses went on to win at Chur-

chill Downs.

”What a horse!” jockey Patrick
Valenzuela said of Sunday Si-
lence. ”He improves every time
he runs. I knew I had the leaders
at the far turn. I had a lot of horse
under me.”

”Charlie’s horse was just awe-
some,” said Eddie Delahoussaye,
who rode Flying Continental.
”My horse ran good. The other
horse was just too much."

Previously unbeaten Houston,
the 9-10 favorite,’ took the lead
early in the 52nd renewal of the
race, but Sunday Silence blew
past him entering the far turn and
won going away.

Houston, ridden by Laffit Pin-
Cay, was finished after that and
wound up fifth, 16‘/2 lengths off
the pace. Houston, who had won
his three previous starts, had
never gone farther than seven
furlongs. '

”He didn't run his race at all,”l

said trainer D. Wayne Lukas,
who along with Texans Bob
French and Barry Beal paid $2.9
million for Houston at a yearling
sale.

Lukas said he might race
Houston before the Kentucky
Derby, but that no decision has
been as to whether Houston will
go in the Derby.

Sunday Silence, the second
choice of the crowd of 42,806,
paid $6.80, $3.40 and $2.80. The
victory, the fourth in six lifetime
starts for the Kentucky-bred son
of Halo, was worth $275,000,
raising his career ‘earnings to

' $406,1 00.

Easy Goer, the future-book
favorite in the Kentucky Derby,
won the Gotham Stakes -at
Aqueduct by 13 lengths earlier
Saturday, setting a track record of
1:32 2-5 for one mile. His next
start will be April 22 at Aqueduct
in the Wood Memorial.

Continued from page 7

"ratings that it gets later.

The problem here is one of
stadium conflict. You never know
what is going to happen in any
playoff situation, but what if the
Boston Bruins and the Boston
Celtics both make their champi-
onship series? Who gets to play
in the Boston Garden?

This could prove ‘to be a
problem. Television would de-
mand thatthe Celtics get first
dibs. No other choice, the Bruins
go away.

Television is not to blame. Net-
works are in it for the money. If
they couldn't make money from

the NBA, there would be no rea- '

son to show it.

It is the NBA administration
that should change. It could make
as much money and still make
the season bearable.

Here is what‘it should do:

0 Shorten the schedule. That is
a foregone conclusion and -has
been stated above.

0 Do awayfwith the divisional

play and just make it two confer-
ences, the Eastern and Western.
As it stands now, the conference

‘ standings mean nothing. The top

eight in each conference make
the playoffs. The only purpose for

divisions is to set up rivalries that 

would still be there with straight
conference play. A lot of
newspapers put their standings
by conferences anyway, so it
wouldn't be a big problem to dis-
band them.

0 Make the playoffs just for the

top four teams. The bottom.four

never make it past the first round
as it is, so they wouldn't be
missed‘.

0 Start the season in Decem-
ber, and thenlwhen teams play
until June it wouldn't seem that
long. '

Four simple changes, that's all

it would take. That way the NBA »
' would gain just as much fan sup-

port as the college game and
would not interfereewith anything
else.
