Winter
Weekend

‘Success’
Winter Weekend was
“very successful,” according
to John ‘Smith, chairman of
the Winter »Weekend Com:
mittee. Concerning‘ ﬁnancial

matters, Smith said “at least we
are in the black.”

Smith added that “Weekend tick-
et sales were above last year’s.”
Smith also felt that big name en-
tertainment still had a chance to
be a success at the University.’

According to Smith, attendance
ﬁgures were as‘ follows: 1,000-
1,100 for Thursday’s concert, 2,-
000 for Fri_day’s carnival, 250 for
the Josh White, Jr. Hootenanny,
and 450 for the’ dance /"Saturday
night. _ I

Spirit Prize

Different

The Basketball Spirit Trophy

“will probably not be given,” ac- _

cording to Cyndie Corbett, Spir-
it Award Committee chairman.
Lack of attendance by partici-
pating groups was cited as the
cause for the decision not to

,_ award the trophy.

Miss Corbett added that “no
one group has accumulated:
enough points to merit the trophy
even though the boys (on the
team) were willing to pay for it
themselves. Only three different
groups showed up at each Jan-
uary home game."

However, the Overall Spirit
Trophy will be given to one
group from each of the four
categories, fraternities, sororities,
women's dorms, and men’s houses,

on the basis of points accumul-..

ated by attendance at football
and basketball games. The trophy
will be presented on Tap Day,
March 2.

The accumulated points of each
group in the four categories are:
Fraternities: Alpha Phi Alpha,

nine; Delta Iota Delta, eight; Del-
ta Sigma Phi, three; Delta Tau

Delta, 40; Phi Epsilon Pi, 10; Pi-

Lambda Phi, 14; Sigma Alpha

Honor Suites Polic 
Visitation Studied}

Parietal hours in the Amos Hall honors suites have;
come under scrutiny by the Administration after a stat

ment was submitted to the Dean of Women's office last’:
Thursday by representatives from the suites.  -

The women felt that “being on their honor” they shoul.
have a voice in the decision as to when men should be allow
ed in the suites. They were dissatisﬁed with the present agreemen
that men must leave the suites no later than 12:30 a.m. Sunday}?
through Thursday and 2:30 a.m. Friday and Saturday. _ _ A

The women’s honor suites are part of an experiment begun’ 
the fall of 1965. Once a woman is chosen by a selection  ﬂ"
comprised of students and administrators, according to the cornmi
tee for revising the honors suites rules, “she is on her honor to liv
within a standard that gives meaning to the criteria by which sh

declared. He attributed WPGH’s
“ability to expand and increase
its quality as much as it has this
year” to “the cooperation and
enthusiasm of the entire staff.”

One of WPGH"s most recent‘
achievements has been the re-

The Ford Report

3-5 My Great Aunt Victoria,
‘a haughty and disgustingly
wealthy individual, only liked
to hear what she wanted to
hear. Contridiction of her
own beliefs simply would not
penetrate her ear drums.

* Always

nodded my
head when
with my aunt
and fed her
back carbon
copy versions of her beliefs.
With’ years gone since those
times and with Aunt Vic-
toria safely tucked away in
the Memorial Park, I can
look back with hindsight on
f the situation. Sadly, I come
to realize such ﬁnagling con-
gstantly goes on and the Ford
Report on the state of the
Ulniversity is a prime exam-
p e.

. THE FORD Report also
complimented those it was
supposed to and gave a thin-
Sly veiled condemnation of
those on the outs. In passing,
it praised the Litchﬁeld ad-
ministration with rather in-
effective generalities and spe-
ciﬁcally ripped apart most
of the major Litchﬁeld inno-
vations. _

 Simply and effectively it
avoided pointing out to the
men at the top where they
had failed and echoed their
condemnation of the Litch-
ﬁeld administration.

The Ford Report chose the
trimester system as one of
'4 he major reasons for the
University’s ﬁnancial. crisis

 past summer. While the

. tion» and ' supporting» costs ?’

When an educational" institution is faced with continual evidence of
if lure in one area of its programming, it usually does some ‘i/nvestigation
?to seek adjustment in policy. While some areas of student affairs have
mproved this year by involving more students (i.e., Student Government),
[rnost have continued in their normal path. '
I The Office of Student Affairs was not oblivious to the need for
re-evaluation. All last trimester the Student Affairs Advisory Committee
9-(SAAC) composed of student leaders, faculty, and student affairs’ admin-
1-istrators outlined the problem using the broad heading of redefining the
“role and function” of student organizations. The topic was so all -encom-
passing that the committee never actually discussed the problem in-depth“
v here were fringe discussions, but never was statistical data gathered,
ills taken, or the core of a research outline presented.
it Now it is time to get some professional aid from outside
Affairs area. Those people involved, such as on the SAAC should be inter-
S iewed, but the task should be undertaken by _a well-trained group whose
Econclusions will have empirical backing and some basis for predicting a ‘
sound future course of action.
_ Several groups around the Pittsburgh area are equipped to handle
such an undertaking. The American Institute for Research, an independent
research organization, has done studies in the area of education, especially
Jpersonnel training and psychology. 9

was a Litchfield innova-
tion begun in 1959 and that
only about one-fourth of all
full time undergraduates
elected to go year-around, it

. neglected much else.

AS FRED M. Hechinger,
education editor of The New
York Times, .pointed out
“The trimester ‘plan was in-
troduced as a potential mon-
ey saver. It had been hailed
as a vital reform by most
leading foundations, includ-
ing Ford.” Hechinger also re-
minded the Ford study com-
mittee that Henry T. Heald,
then president ofthe Ford
Foundation, urged the State
University of New York .to
switch "to the trimester sys-
tem.

Hechinger further indites
the Pittsburgh community
leaders for entertaining “the
fond hope that an institution
can be just slightly great at
bargain rates.” None of this
is in the Ford Report.

But as was stated in the
report and re-emphasized in
the official University re-
lease on the study, the com-
mittee gave particular praise
to Trustees Chairman
Gwilym A. Price for “a series
of bold and effective steps
toward recovery” from ﬁnan.
cial problems.

Also “the committee com-
mends the Board of Trustees
and the officer for their
progress during 1965 toward
structural streamlining,
thereby reducing administra-

-Studernltnffiaurs

. If this University is to maintain any integrity as a liberal arts col-
We its entire program in Student Affairs needs an immediate and thor-
ugh ’evaluation——one not based on internal self-analysis,’ but one spear-
eaded by a scientific analysis by professionals.

Need for such an analysis is demonstrated by the lackeof centralized
planning and student involvement everytime an extra-curricular activity
undertaken. A few examples this year have been: Homecoming, Seren-
dipity Singers, Winter Weekend, Student Government (SG), University
thé'atrica1 performances, and the usual dull, unattractive, or non-existent .
programs of the school’s 100 “recognized undergraduate student organiza-

 

-- Stop The Deterioration

Another qualified group is the University’s own Learning Research
and Development Center. Although the center deals primarily with ele-
mentary educational analysis, it prepared monographs for one of the new
state-affiliation plans now under consideration.

A third possible source for objective, empirical analysis of the stu-
dent affairs area is the Allegheny Conference on Regional Development.
Such a group should be consulted to obtain professional advice on issues
such as housing, parking, and social, athletic, and consumer needs.

Of course these agencies all require money, but it is reasonable to
employ some of the money from the activities fee to subsidize such neces-
sary and far-reaching research. It is reasonable to get professional analysis
by well-trained expertiseinstead of relying solely on the View of over-
involved administrators and students. ’

The use of such people and analyses should not frighten those cur-
rently holding positions in student affairs. They should not view it as an
infringement on their domain. Instead the Office of Student Affairs should

 

   

urge a well-founded study of all its domain from Student Government to

the Student,

personnel requirements for student affairs’ administrators, from the role
of student publications to the coordination of campus organizations.

We can no longer depend solely on internal analyses_ biased by the
vested interests of all involved-—students, faculty, and administrators
alike. The Ford report was an analysis by a group of experts which will be
used for analyzing the University’s‘ ﬁnancial problem and its solution. It
was not done by administrators, faculty, or students—some were inter-
viewed’ and. their views put in a broader perspective. L

Although a similar approach to student affairs may not provide a
panacea, it is a necessary step. It is it step which the Vice-Chancellor for
Student Affairs should encourage. It is a step the students should encour-
age- It is a necessary step to keep the University a place where the well- .

« rounded, liberally-educated student can be developed. It is a requisite for

_ education may deteriorate.

Unfortunately no speciﬁc information is available at the present

Sophomore Cager Bob Thompson ,
Turned Down 60 Football Offers

By JAY ROSENSTEIN

Bob Thompson played football for Shaler High School before he came here two years
ago. He played well enough to earn honorable mention on the Pennsylvania Big 33 team.
As an offensive tackle and a defensive end he played well enough to Win a berth on the All-
WPIAL squad for two straight years. ’

Many of the big-time collegiate football powers around the country thought he played

Tartans Seek Revenge

Carnegie Tech Senses Win
Over Hoopsters Tomorrow

Carnegie Tech hosts the Panther basketball team to-
morrow night in a game that has a markedly different at-
mosphere about it from the one the two teams played to

open the season.

The hoopsters barely squeaked by in that contest, 54-51.
Since then, Tech has won nine games while losing only three.

The Panther ﬁve has won only
three others while losing 12.

Because the Tartans have the
home court advantage (and tiny
Skibo gym is a deﬁnite advan-
tage), Tech players and students
sense the upset.

Tech is riding a four game win
streak, with the most recent vio-
tory a 68-67 come from behind
win over Westminster. The Tar-
tans trailed in that game at one
time 20-6. But backcourt sharp-
shooter Ray Morrison and junior
forward Jeff Kalin brought them
back from a lackadaisical ﬁrst
half to win.

The cagers faced Westminster.

earlier in the season and barely
held on for a 70-69 triumph. But
the analogy should stop right
there. The Panthers have recent-
ly faced opposition considerably
more talented than anything Tech
has won against.

Among the teams that the hoop-
sters have lost to during their
current ﬁve game losing string
are Penn State, West Virginia,
St. John’s, and Fordham. In three
of those games, they had a real
good chance to win. But it’s been
that kind of season.

That season continues on Sat-
urday when the Panthers enter-
tain Temple.

well enough to merit a scholar-
ship offer. Some 60 colleges want-
ed Thompson to play football for
them.

The 6-5, 225 pounder said no
to all the offers. He said no to
the Big Ten, the Ivy League,
Penn State and Syracuse. For
buried in between all the grid-
iron applications was a basket-
ball scholarship from Pitt.

“My father, brother, and sis-
ter went to school here,” Thomp-
son explained. “I want to be a
doctor and since my father grad-
uated from the University Medi-
cal School, I gums that Pitt
was always my ﬁrst choice.”

Thompson had been told that
he could have a football scholar-
ship from here if he wanted it.
Instead, he chose the basketball
grant. “Let’s face it,” Thompson
said. “Footbal1’s tremendous grind
from August to November, plus
spring practice.

“I felt that I could do more
for myself and more for the
school if I played basketball.”

Three Meets
Remain On

Mat Schedule

With the wrestling record
now 1-5, there are only threex
meets left in which to try to
balance out‘the record. Two of
those meets are with Lehigh and
Penn State and the odds of win-
ning aren’t encouraging.

The only realistic chance the
matmen have then of recording
another victory is against West
Virginia this weekend. Despite
the fact that the Mountaineer
wrestlers have captured the
Southern Conference crown for

Thompson’s roundball credentials
are almost as impressive as his
football notices.

He played three years of has-
ketball for Shaler. During his
senior year he was named to the
WPIAL Section 9 team as the
best center in the section. “We
won the section title that year,”
said Thompson. “In the WPIAL
quarterﬁnals at the Field House,
the Midland team that went on
to win the state championship
knocked us off.”

“The Mule,” as Thompson has _

been called since ninth grade,
relied on his strength to score
points in high school, “That does-
n’t work anymore,” he said.
“Everybody under the boards has
strength. Rebounds and points
aren’t easy to come by.”

The Panther sophomore hasn’t
played that often this year to grab
rebounds and score points. “I
usually get into the game with

about ﬁve minutes to go in the
ﬁrst half to spell Jim LaValley,”
Thompson noted. “When you
come off the bench, it takes a
minute or so to get adjusted to
the action.”

When Thompson mention La-
Valley, he chuckled a little. “It
was Jim who carried over the
name “Mule.” He went to Shaler
before I did. I don’t mind the
term as long as girls don’t use it
too.”

Both Thompson and LaValley
set up the screens, throw the
picks, and pass off in the Panther
offense. That's our center's job,”
said Thompson. “I think I'd rath-
er play the corner, though. My
best shot in high school was from
there. I only wish I was quicker.”

Slow or not, Thompson chose
basketball at Pitt over football
at virtually anywhere else. He
feels he made the right choice
and that's what counts.

Tech J.V.’s Next

Dukes’ Height Threatens
Cubs’ Five Game Streak

By ROY JACOBS
Some people yell and
scream and get upset be-
cause the University doesn’t
schedule Duquesne among
its regular basketball oppon-

ents, and the two big area
teams never meet unless it’s in
the Steel Bowl-ﬁnals. Well, for
those people and any other in-
terested fans, there is an intra-
city clash in miniature tonight at
the Civic Arena at 6:30, when
the Panther frosh meet the Du-
quesne freshmen. )
Once again the Cubs are com-
ing up against a taller, but slow-
er team. “They’re almost the
same as West Virginia,” said

> coach Tim Grgurich. “They have

three boys 6-8 and they have big
guards.” The coach added that
he was familiar with theiDukes’
players because he saw them all
play last year.

“We plan to press more than
usual and run all game. We’ll
probably have to use more than
the ﬁrst eight.” The hope here is
that the smaller Cub guards are
quicker than the Duquesne back-
court. A

Grgurich was conﬁdent his

squad would be able to fast break,

“We rebounded with West Vir-
ginia, and we can rebound with
them. We’ll have to play a lot
better defense against Duquesne
than we did against Point Park.”

The Cubs have a lot of things
going for them—a ﬁve game win-
ning streak, an 8-2 record, and
a smattering of student support.
Tonight’s game is important to
them, and a victory could be the
high point of the season.

Tomorrow night presents a dif-
ferent problem. The frosh face
the Carnegie Tech J .V.’s for the
second time this season. The Cubs
won by almost 30 the ﬁrst time,
and yet their 66 points were
their lowest output of the season.

“I don’t know how they’ll take
that game after getting up so
much for Duquesne,” commented
Grgurich.

Once again, the coach plans to
substitute freely, hoping for an
early lead. Wear and tear could
begin to tell on the team because
it starts a ﬁve game in eight days
with Duquesne and Carnegie
Tech.

Frank Clements’ 19 points
against Point Park was one of
the few times this season when
a Cub guard was the game's high
scorer.

Hawthorne House
Dominates Dorm
Wrestling Action

Hawthorne House Wrest-
lers dominated the scene in
the dormitory wrestling
tournament at Trees Hall Gym
last week. The men of Hawthorne
grabbed ﬁve ﬁrst places in the
nine weight divisions, outpoint-
ing Playboy Penthouse, their
nearest foe, 60-24.

Mike Keller pooled two for-
felts and a pin of Panther House’s
Al Bishero to earn the 120-pound
championship for Hawthorne. In
the 140 and 150—pound, Haw-
thorne’s Willard Dyckes and
Dave Hein did-in opponents with
ease.

Steve Solnoki in the 170-pound
class and Bob Kirk in the 190-
pound class brought additional
honors to Hawthorne.

Runnerup Playboys combined
two ﬁrst place victories for their
points. John Nicholas earned the
160-pound crown, pinning Haw-
thorne’s Ken Stavisky in 28 sec-
onds. In the heavyweight divi-
sion, the Playboy’s Joel Klimek
pinned two opponents to reign
supreme.

Ed Nemeth paced Panther’s
third place ﬁnish (14 points)
with a ﬁrst in the 180-pound
class while Walt Brehm‘ gained
most of Keystone’s 11 points with
a ﬁrst in the 130-pound bracket.

GT&E makes no eﬁort to compete
with nature's awesome forces. But
we do the next best thing. We take
the reason for lightning and bar-
ness it to everyday tasks.

In that way, we've helped to
make the lowly electron mighty.
And our own capabilities more ex-
tensive.

In fact, we’ve made electronics
an important force in our business.
And branched into virtually all
directions electronics would take
us . . . communications, radio, ,TV,

GT&E member companies, such
as Automatic Electric, Lenkurt
Electric and Sylvania, either man-
ufacture the complete equipment
or the electronic components from
which they’re built. And at the
same time serve as major suppliers

and the communications industry. _

You might say that, because of
electronics, GT&E’s possibilities
are endless. That's the way it looks
from where we sit.
