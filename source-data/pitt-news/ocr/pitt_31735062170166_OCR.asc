Project Thought Probes

by CARLA SYDNEY STONE
Staff News Writer

Project Thought met Wednesday night
in the Supper Room with a total attendance
of 35. The invited speakers were Dr. Jer-
ome Schneewind, dean-elect of the College
of Arts and Sciences; Dr. Jack Critchfield,
assistant chancellor; and Steele ‘Gow, Jr.,
FAS acting dean.

The. topic was “Channels for Change.”
On student apathy, Scott Baum, SG presi-
dent, pointed out, the “only way to get a sit-
uation changed is to get issues popular
with students and even then it doesn’t
work.”

Dave Tiernan, editor of The Pitt News,
spoke about" the amount of mail received
each issue by the paper when it publishes
unpopular editorials or columns. I, In an-
swer to a question by a member of the fac-
ulty, he said, “Ofcourse, we don’t repre-
sent the majority of students, because we
aren’t sitting back doing nothing.”

Several solutions to the school's prob-
lems were tossed around. Baum believed
that “this system is working at its maxi-
mum efficiency; the_only way to get it to
work better is to _distribute the power
among faculty, students, and administra-
tion.” He then went on to state that “fas-
cism, whether student or faculty, is the
same.” " v

Many students had questions about
courses. One girl spoke of a course which
the students were allowed to choose the
books, and for which there where no tests,
finals, origrades. She also saidthat it was

Pittsburgh’s Spring Action Committee
has scheduled a March for Peace_and Jus-
tice to be held Saturday. The march’s pur-
pose, according to the committee, is to ex-
press concern over the war in Vietnam and
social injustice here in America.

Concerned Pittsburghers will assemble
at 11 p.m. at Freedom Center, behind the
Civic Arena at Centre and Crawford. A feed-
er march will leave the Cathedral of Learn-
ing at 10 a.m. and join the main gathering
at Freedom Center.

The marchers will proceed to Gate-

- Jazz Musician‘ Ken McIntyre, compos-
er, multi—instrumentalist, lecturer, teach-
er, conductor and arranger, will join the
University music faculty this fall.

As artist—composer, McIntyre has four
recordings to his credit: “Looking Ahead,”
“Stone Blues,” “The Year of the Iron
Sheep” and “Way, ‘Way Out.” He also com-
posed the film scores for How Wide Is Sixth
Avenue and Miracle on the BMT, featur-
ettes which have been shown at various
film festivals here and in Europe.

McIntyre performs on the flute, oboe,
alto saxophone, clarinet, bassoon, English
horn and bass clarinet. He played in the
1963, 1965 and 1966 Newport Jazz
Festivals and has played at New York’s
Town Hall and Museum of Modern» Art.
New York clubs he has appeared in include
Birdland, the Five Spot, Minton’s, Coronet,
the Prelude and Moulin Rouge. In addition,
he has performed in clubs in Boston and
Provi_ncetown, at numerous universities,
and on several television shows.

Many students fail to receive word of cur-..

Suggestions at the end of the meeting’,
the first of the spring term, indicated that
specific issues should be discussed at ‘fu-
ture meetings, rather than one or two gent
eral topics. “Then the faculty or adminis
trators involved could be present to ‘an,
swer the students’ questions,” Dr. Critcli
field noted. '

'2 I Once there was a Gen’rul who
became the Big Shot. He was a
hard-core user of the Red Menace
but could see no harm in it. He
itole his Main Man Dilldo, “All
'that stuff ‘bout ad-diction is noth-
‘ in: but a pack 0’ lies. I been gittin’
high on this stuff fer years an’ it
ain’t done nothin’ to me yet.”

Dilldo re-plied, “Yeah, man. I'm
diggin’ yer scene. The Red Men-
’ ace is jus’ a good ole friendly high.

As ‘Merican as hot dogs.”

“Red Menace in Asia sure is
good,” said the Gen’rul. “What
say we get us a good head off’n
that stuff fer awhile.”

_ So the Gen’rul (who had nothin’
else to do with hisself in the mean-
time) sent for a quantity of men to
get him the Asian Red Menace.

1 And at reg’lar intervals he would
have his dose of men and git his-

4 . self good an’ high.

He gradu’ly had to increase the
does in order to maintain his high.
‘He di’nt care, he jus’ sent fer
;_r'nor.e men. When he stepped down
from Big Shot he said toghis Main
Man, “Dilldo, these been won’er-
, I ful years. I never been so high in
. I my life. I‘ want you to b’come th’
nex’ Big Shot and groove on ston-
‘ in the Red Menace."

“Hot damn!” said Dilldo who
shou1d’n had b’cause he did not
b’come the nex’ Big Shot.

   
 
    
   
 
   
   
 
   
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
    
    
  
 
   
   
 

Student Power: Fact

Editor, The Pitt News,

I was very disappointed to read
the editorial May 13, 1969, on
the alleged “student power” that
supposedly prevails at Pitt. Such
 talk’ indicates a profound lack of
. understanding concerning the
' power struggles across the coun-
try. Nothing has changed at this
university. Belief to the contrary
indica'tes co-option or ignorance.

 —,Power' may be defined by the
immediacy and strength of re-
: sponse to a given stimulus. Thus,
 the order to assume attention,

when executed properly by his pla-

toon, defines the drill instructor’s
‘A ‘power. The same order carried
out by a regiment defines the cap-
v tain’s power. Response,‘ there-
fore, is equated with control. Ad-
visory systems are not included
in the model. Advisors have no
power unless the power base is
" weak. The sergeant may advise
the captain, but if the captain be-
_ j comes dependent on the sergeant,
 ‘the captain becomes, in part, a

‘ puppet.

It is to be expected that Pitts-

burgh‘ provincialism would pro-

ji .- duce only the most cursory as-
sessment of the ' most insignifi-.

* cant symptoms. The more ob-

:' vious disease is too threatening
'5 to be comprehended. What is a
, . university? What are its services
_ _ to be and for whom? Is the admin-
  -istration the servant of the. stu-

Hav’vid instead was the succes-
sor to the Gen’rul. He liked the
Red Menace hisself and in no
time a-tall became ad-dicted. But,
unfort’nat’ly his habit was not git-
tin’ him high so he had to keep in-
creasin’ the dose 0’ men. I do’n
know if he-“ever re’lized that he had
b’come a junkie but it di’nt matter
too much ’cause somebody come
along an shot Hah’vid to death.

He were su—ceeded by his Main
Man, Texan. Texan thought to his-
self, “I’m gonna have me some
fun with the Red Menace like them
las’ two Big Shots. Olny thing is,
I ain’t gonna be’come ad-dicted
’cause I’m too dang smart.”

The Texan started off occupy-
in some 0’ his time with the Red
Menace. But, b’fore he knew it he
was hooked. He kep’ takin’ more
an’ more men an’ gittin’ less an’
less high.

At the end of his Big Shotdom
he was expendin’ mos’ of his time
an’ energies on the Red Menace.
He was a spent man. The habit

had taken years off his life. He.

looked t_er’ble.

The Dilldo had finally made Big
Shot. Before the Texan stepped
down he said to his successor,
“Don’t’ mess with the habit. I
couldn’t kick the yella monkey
off’nmyback.”

The Dilldo jus’ smiled an’ said,
“Don’ worry ‘bout me, Texan, I
won‘ get hooked.”

    
   

Or Fiction?

dent and faculty or the mouth-
piece for the trustees? What roles
do the trustees play in the univer-
sity, in the community, in socie-
ty? What attitudes or activities of
the trustees or administrators
are in conflict with their roles
within the university? And, who
has the ultimate authority to an-
swer these questions and follow
the answers with action? Such au-
thority would constitute power.

I think that students should sit
down with faculty and talk about
education and departmental deci-
sions. But, that's not power. Do
students control faculty con-
tracts? Do the prevailing condi-
tions even allow a significant
voice in such matters? Do stu-
dents control or have any say in
the kinds of research contracts a
faculty member may accept? Is

such information open for student '

appraisal? Who ultimately de-
cides how a course should be con-
ducted? Let me repeat, who and
what is the university and for
whom is it run?

Someone is so afraid that stu-
dents are going to wake up.and be-
come nauseated over the crap
that’s dumped on them and rise
up against this foul order. The ad-
ministration has convinced the
student and faculty that things

are cool and rational here and no -

one has to question anyone be-
cause everyone has power. Real-

Dreams Of Land Of Opportunity
Nightmares For Migrant Farmers

by DIANNE ULYON '
Staff News Writer
At this point in our nation’s
history, the country is being
awakened from its dreams as
the land of equal opportunity.
Movements are stripping
down those dreams and re-

vealing the naked facts. The

Blacks, the students, and the
migrant farmers are ‘making

their case known. All are not
equal before the law. This is not
the land where all face their desti-
nies with the same options avail-
able. '

The migrant farmers, unlike
the Blacks and the students, have
a historical precedent to their
cause — a historical battle for un-
ion representation that won indus-
trial workers the right of bargain-
ing powers with their employers.

MANY WHO REFUSE to see or
cannot see the motivation behind
the Black and the student move-
ments should be able to identify
with ‘the farm workers’ move-
ment. The business element of
our society, whether conserva-
tive or liberal, cannot for obvious

reasons be expected to sympa-
thize. It is the conservative — or
maybe even uneducated — labor-
class and their children at the
University to whom this is ad-
dressed.

Too often and too easily there

is a tendency to brush aside a new '

political or social development;
perhaps because it is conceived
as a threat to one’s own security,
or perhaps because one has not
given it enough serious thought to
see how personally relevant the
issues are.

To those of you whose father’s
belong to the steelworkers, the

you live compared to the condi-

tions depicted in “The Harvest.

_ decisions.of the students and fac-

ulty in altering the role of ROTC
on campus?

While the university may fin-
ally be acqiescing to Black Power
and beginning to deal with a ne-
glected black community, is it
reasonable that some university
officials and faculty are members
or affiliates of the Pittsburgh
Athletic Association. Such mem-
bership does not amount to much
given the overall university com-
munity, but does it not constitute
a moral conflict of interest?

Who determines the physical de-
velopment of the university?
Who determines the economics of
such expansion? Who determines
university housing policy and
rates? Towhom are these people
responsible? Who has the right
to restrict your sexual or social
freedom? Many universities al-
low free movement of men and
women, at any time. Why not
here? Are you different? Are you
not men and women? Why are you
restricted? Why do they have such
power?

The administration is slick. But
perhaps the level of student inter-
est is a contributing factor. It is
dangerous that realistic analyses
of these and other very pressing
problems have escaped the stu-
dents‘ intellectual curiosity and
time committment.

You’ve been fooled. baby. You’ve
got no power and never will have

until you sit in the chancellor's
chair and until you and the faculty
make policy, not the chancellor
and trustees. There’ aren’t even
any avenues open to students to-
wards a settlement of these above
questions. And even if such ave-
nues did exist or could be manu-

factured, they would look more

like alleys. As long as they make
the rules, and as long as you play
their game, there will be no
change.

Only by refusing to play, and
thus take’ power, will there be"
change. They’ll tell you that you
are irresponsible or led by a rad-
ical minority of revolutionaries
who prey upon your insecurities
and sensitivities but, don’t be con-
ned. Once you attack their power,
their authority, they’ll rain hell
on you. They are fighting for their
power-packed «lives in this coun-
try. And, if they don’t fight back
when you present a demand, you
had better believe that they’re not
giving up very much.

The main problem is to decide
within your own mind whether
freedom is worth getting your
head cracked open for. Their main
problem is to keep you from think-
ing about it.

eldest daughter had to quit school
to care for the younger children
while the parents were in the
fields. Similar stories were told
by other interviewees whose
wages are only one to three dol-
larsaday.

Rather than enumerate how un-
ions have played their role in giv-
ing you the opportunities you have,
as opposed to those of the mi-
grant farmer’s child, it is sug-
gested that you think of your own
career aspirations —— or the edu-
cation you are getting and the fi-
nancial securityit will provide.

This is not to say that unions
will guarantee the success of its
members’ children. This is only
to suggest that unions have pro-
vided workers with certain secur-
ities for themselves and their
familites that facilitate that suc-
cess. The migrant workers want
the same guarantees that are of-
fered to the industrial workers
under the National Labor Rela-
tions Act. ‘

TO DATE THE Grape Boycott
has been a non-violent protest;
despite attempts to belittle their
tactics and cause. This article
goes out to you and asks you to
evaluate the movement in a frame
of reference biased by your own
experiences. Think of the past and
present educational and economic
advantages you have had which
are by-products of your father’s.
union membership. Then think
about the diet of the family of nine
and the daughter who was forced
to quit school.

Those of you who find you can
identify with the farm workers
cause, yet you still refust to act
in any way should keep in mind
that this inaction could force the
grape workers movement to vio-
lent tactics in the future.

Money To Pay

Lawyer Fees

Editor, The Pitt News, ,

On April 24, ten Pittsburgh
students were arrested by city po-
lice at 3 and 5 Mawhinney St. in
Oakland on charges of violating
the Dangerous Drug and Cosmetic
Act. Confiscated during the raid
was less than one-half ounce of
marijuana; bonds totaled $72,-

‘ 000 initially and were later lower-

ed to $26,000. Charges have
already been dismissed against
four of us, and our lawyers have
said it is quite probable that, for
lack of sufficient evidence, only
two of the ten people originally ar-
reased will eventually be tried in
court. Unfortunately, lawyer fees
and bond fees will be over $2,-
500 for the ten of us, regardless
of the outcome of the trial or the
innocence of those people against

whom charges were dismissed. .

We are having serious difficulties
in raising the money to pay these
expenses, and we urgently ask -for
any donation, no matter how large
or small, from any sympathetic
professors, students,- or other
friends. Please send any donations

Stephens, Trademark Lid. Swissvale

by BOB BON N
Staff News Writer

Last Friday and Saturday night,
a singer named Tim Stevens ap-
peared at the Swizzle Stick
Lounge, along with a group call-
ed the Trademarks, Ltd. Both
proved to be great entertainment.

Tim Stevens, a tall, friendly fel-
low had a voice almost reminis-
cent of Johnny Mathis, but not
quite. He sounded best on ballads
like “By the Time I Get to Phoe-
nix” and “Eleanor Rigby.”

Friday was Stevens’ first ap-
pearance in Pittsburgh, and he
performed to a capacity crowd
at the Swizzle Stick. A graduate
student at the University, Stevens
is hopeful that his singing side-
line may turn into a career.

Those who have heard him feel
that he does have the potential.
Stevens’ act is enjoyable and well-
performed; those tired of frater-
nity parties and Friday night So-
cial Films will find it a welcome
change.

Although Stevens’ current en-
gagement is over, he will be mak-
ing more appearances in the near
future. These will be advertised in

.  The major difficulty_at this time is completingthe rosters of the
North and South squads that will meet at Forbes Field in a 1:30 p.m.

Each squad. will have four hurl-
ers, and so far the top three vote-
getters will ptich for the North.
They are Joe Filipowski (Clarion
State), Ray Zelnak (Indiana) and
Larry Sawyer (Grove City).

Lewis’ top hurler, George Med-
ich, probably won’t make the
squad, despite finishing behind
only two South hurlers in the bal-
loting.

Two of Lewis’,mitter/s cracked
the starting line-up. They are
shortstop Ron O’Grodnik and out-
fielder Bob Solonickne.

Some confusion could arise at
the shortstop spot. The second
highest tally at the position be-
longs to Point Park’s Joe O’Grod-

nik, Ron’s Brother.Point Park

players will battle for the South,
so the brothers could be opposing
each other.

The only thing that could pre-
vent that is a shortstop named
Dave Brown. The California mit-
ter is the leading vote grabber at
that infield spot at this time, so he
might be the South starter.

As things stand now, California
could have as many starters as
any other team represented on the
South squad. Counting the top
three pitchers — since no hurler
will be allowed to go more than
three innings — California is sure
to have at least two players in the
game. So will WVU, Point Park,
and Youngstown.

Representation isn’t as balanc-
ed on the North Side. Clarion State
and Indiana will be represented
by three starters each.

The other Northteams are Pitt

Slippery Rock (one), Gannon
(one), Geneva, and Edinboro.

  A Calculated Risk ‘

by Jerry (lruebel
Sports Editor

  

e...
sssssssssssssssssssssss

When Buzz Ridl accepted the post as mentor of the
Jungle Cats last year, somebody forgot to give him a cape.

Ridl was determined to meet the challenge of big-
time college basketball after a 12-year reign as one of
the most successful small college coaches in the nation.

At Westminster, he had accumulated 216 wins against
only 91 losses, a sort of supernatural winning percentage
of .704.

But it would have taken more than a highly competent or;
coach to transform in one year the bunch of palsied hoops-
ters Ridl inherited, into a respectable big-time college
quintet. It would have taken a superman, something Ridl
himself would readily admit he is not.

Despite last .s.ea’son’sl 4-20 tragedy, the Jungle Cats
were an improved assemblage of players under the new~
head coach. They couldn’t shoot much better than grand-
ma, and they lacked height and speed, but they managed
to stay in a lot of ball games because'Ridl meshed them
into a team. ' - ,

_Ridl will have more talent to work with this year. Last
year’s freshmen team was loaded with promising hoops-
sters. Steve Lewis, Kent Scott, and Bob Cizmarick are all
competent’ guards that will be fighting for starting berths
with incumbent Mike Caldwell. And 6-7 Paul O’Gorek is
an improvement over anyone the Jungle Cats have used at

‘ pivot in recent years.

However, the real improvement is expected to ignite
’ from another guard, Cleveland Edwards, a transfer from
Robert Morris. The 5-10, 180—pound ballhandler and play-
maker has all the qualifications that justify such hopes,
dating back to his high school days when he was a member
of the City Catholic team in the 1967 Post—Gazette Round-

ball Classic. .

Edwards was an all-state selection when he was play-
ing for Fifth Avenue High School, and he was just as good
in the college ranks under Gus Krop. Last year, Edwards
co-captained the Colonials through a profitable season
that saw them runners-up in the National Junior College
tournament in Hutchinson, Kas.‘ ’

But will Edwards help Ridl’s Jungle Cats improve in "~-
the area most critics deem important, the won-lost statis-
tics? It won’t be easy. The schedule-makers on Cardiac
Hill just might be short-stepping the processof building a
respectable big-time basketball team. It’s what Ridl lab-
els “a calculated risk.”

Theslate for the 1969-70 campaign lists nine new
opponents, including road games at St. John’s, Baldwin-
Wallace, Wisconsin, and Detroit. The men of Ridl will also
be up against Minnesota and Bowling Green at the Detroit
Motor City Classic. Georgia Tech, Kent State, and Mar-
shall will be new to the Pittsburgharea next season.

Add those games to the two contests slated against
West Virginia, Penn State, and Westminster, and the
games scheduled with Temple, Syracuse, George Wash-
ington, Lafayette, and Rutgers. The schedule just might be
going big-time at a faster pace than that of the team.

Mitters Finish Season. Too Soon;

M€(liC]l Misses "Cor-tiers’? At Kent

by ED CONLEY I
Suddenly, coach Bobby Lewis finds the season has ended
for his Panther mitters, andhe can only think‘ of fruit. "

The squad was supposed to close their spring campaign to-
day with an afternoon contest against’ Duquesne, but shortly before pre-
paring for the trip to Kent, Ohio, Lewis found out that the game had
been cancelled because of a heavy exam schedule. '

Thecancellation was a disappointment because the Panthers romp-

ed over the Dukes in a_previous
meeting. But that didn’t bother
Lewis as much as the journey to
Kent. . - — .

The mitters lost the ball game
in Ohio and the score wasn’t very
pleasant: Kent State—l0, Pitt-
1.

The only mitter run came on a
ninth inning smash by Frank Gus-

tine. The homerun was Gustine’s.
first circuit blow for the season. '

and it enabled him to cop the club
batting title.

Lack of scoring on his team‘s
part wasn’t the thing that caused
Lewis to_think of fruit. though.

Medich fired awayqfor five inn-

Dear Mr. Galvin:

I speak of the future—the
vacuumous invisibility of the
coming times. The future has
one certainty: the total
acceptance by big business of
the “computer as a replacement
for the office worker. Business
has followed the times, even
paced the times. Therefore, the
speed, accuracy, and future
creativity of developing
computers cannot be denied by
future business. ‘

The clerk, the bureaucratic non-
entity of business, will be
replaced by the complexity, yet
practical simplicity of the
computer. A computer gathers
and analyzes information faster
and more accurately than man.

The memory lock of any computer :’

offers the most logical answer
to any given problem and
theoretically possesses an

unlimited memory. And if science 

can duplicate in the machine the
DNA code of the human, the
creative thoughts of the human
could be synthesized in the
machine.

The computer's primary code
could essentially simulate man's
life controlling function

regulated by the mysterious DNA H‘

amino acids code. When
research, as at the University
of Chicago, refines its DNA
investigation and applies it to
cybernetics, the machine could
achieve the creative function it

now lacks. Thus, it is conceivable

the machine could invent an
item or develop a thought well
beyond man's creative limits.

The final determining force
unfortunately is man's selective
programming into the machine.
Will man thus fear the power of
the machine? Will computers be
developed to their fullest
potential, and allowed to
function? More important, will
business accept the apparent
philosophical implications of a
machine having better talents
than man?

Yours sincerely,

Dear Mr. Shelby:

Why should man fear the
machine? It's a tool for the
elimination of drudgery. . .

for freeing people from limiting
routine. Each more sophisticated
application opens another door
to exciting new functions for
the individual. -

As to business’ acceptance of the
apparent philosophical implica-
tions of a machine being better
talented than man, let's expand
your question to include society
as a whole. Your suggested
potential of the machine's
inventiveness, after all, would not
only affect the structure of
business and its practices but

the role of the individual in

every institution of the com-
munity—education, government,
the professions, in fact. man's
day to day living environment.
Already many of these changes

have been manifest.

Think of the brigades of

bookkeepers trapped through the

years into peering from under
their green eyeshades at

mounting columns of figures.
With perfection of the adding
machine and comptometer, their
working world assumed a whole
new dimension. No more

scratching out monthly

statements with a steel-tipped
pen. Instead, many have assumed
functionally more interesting
responsibilities by applying the

‘skills, and wider knowledge,

needed to use these too|s..As' a
result, the individual gained
more capabilities, and industry,
more capacity.

.The computer has broadened the
horizon much further. With its

characteristic abilities for
sensing, feedback, and
self—adjustment'—-the
determination of changing
requirements without human
intervention—masses of data can
be digested and analyzed, and
complex calculations made, to
meet the needs for which

it is programmed.

Its applications already have had
a profoundeffect on almost
every phase of our daily lives.
Look, for example. at its
employment in teaching:
programmed lesson plans in a
dozen subjects thatpermit
student responses, and instant
correction of errors, which
enable uninterrupted progress to
the extent of each individual's
capacity. And the day is not far
off when many university
libraries will be linked together
in a vast information retrieval
system.'A question fed into a
machine by you at Tulane may
elicit needed data from memory
locks at Cornell, or
Northwestern, or Stanford.

. is a characteristic. But I am v .4.‘

Its uses in long—range economic
policy planning by government
and business are infinite. A
projection of population growth
concentrations five years ahead,
or twenty, will make possible
realistic plans for food
requirements, or housing starts,
or highway construction
programs, or the thousands upon
thousands of goods and services
requisite for further up—grading
our living standards.

And what about the computerized 1
services touching all of us that
already are taken for granted:
programming -traffic lights to
cope with rush-hour congestion
. reconciliation of monthly

bank statements . . . processing
individual income tax returns. . .
even notifications from
insurance companies when-
premiums are due.

All of this is part of the
increasingly fast-paced tempo of
our times. Man now demands
"more", and he demands it
"faster." This poses
requirements best met by wider
usages of computers, and in

turn prompts the need for
computers with increasingly 
sophisticated characteristics

to keep pace.

The point is that the philosophic
implications arising from the
economic and social
consequences of computer
complexes already has been
accepted by society.

Paradoxically, as computerized
functions broaden, job losses
don't necessarily follow. To the
contrary, new fields of
employment open, and people
directly affected acquire new
skills and abilities which improve
their earning capacities—to the
extent that each utilizes the
opportunities proffered. Isn't this
a capsulated instance of the
force-drive for progress.

and man's growth?

No one really knows to what
exotic limits computers can be
developed. The day may well
come when ”creative thought"

confident that during the
intermediate evolutionary steps,
man's own intellectual
sophistication will continue to
outpace the machine, ‘and assure
control over a product of hisown
making. Certainly there's no real
cause for worry, however-, until

' the machine learns how to

plug itself in.

Sincerely,

Chairman, Motorola Inc.

IS ANYBODY LISTENING
TO CAMPUS VIEWS?

BUSINESSMEN ARE. 

Three chief executive officers—The
Goodyear Tire .& Rubber Company's
Chairman, Russe/lDe Young, The Dow
Chemical C ompany’s President,

H. D. Doan. and Motorola's
Chairman, Robert W". Ga/vin—are
responding to serious questions and
viewpoints posed by students about
business and its role in our changing

society. . .and ‘from their perspective
‘as heads of ma/or corporations are

exchanging views through means of
a campus/ corporate Dialogue
Program on specific issues raised by
leading student spokesmen.

Here, Arnold Shelby, in Libera/Arts at
Tulane, is exploring a point with Mr.
Galvin. K eenly interested in Latin
American political and social
problems, Mr. Shelby toured various
countries in the area last summer on
a ”shoe—string” budget. He plans a

career in journalism.

In the course of the entire Dialogue
Program, Arthur K/ebanoff, a Yale
senior, will probe issues with Mr.
Galvin,‘ as will Mark Bookspan, a
Chemistry major at Ohio State, and

All of these Dialogues will appear in
this publication, and other campus
newspapers across the country,
throughout this academic year.
Campus comments are invited, and
should be forwarded to Mr. _
DeYoung, Goodyear, Akron, Ohio,‘

David G. Clark, in graduate studies at M,‘ 003,7, DOW C/,em,-Cw M,-0:/and
Michigan,’ or Mr, Galvin, Motorola,
Franklin Park, Illinois, as appropriate. ‘

Stanford, with Mr. DeYoung,‘ and
similarly, David M. Butler, Electrical
Engineering, Michigan State, and
Stan Chess, Journalism, Cornell,
with Mr. Doan.
