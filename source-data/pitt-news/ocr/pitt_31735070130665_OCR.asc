alcohol
awareness

.to campus

LESLIE HOFFMAN

Staff Writer

As part of National Collegiate
Alcohol Awareness ,Week, Pitt is
sponsoring a number of -events to
heighten students’ awareness and
understanding of alcohol. ,

To kick off the week, ﬁve Pitt stu-
dents‘ participated in a four-day con-
ference Downtown. From Saturday to

Tuesday, the students accompanied

Pitt’s Director of Student Health
Shirley Haberman to the U.S.
Department of Education’s 14th

Annual Alcohol, Other Drug and.

Violence Prevention in ‘Higher
Education, meeting at the Pittsburgh
Hilton. , . '
Yesterday, Health Education
Services and Residence Life operated
"a stand in the Schenley Quadrangle
advocating alcohol awareness.
KoriAnderson and James Troup,
graduate students working for Health
Education, hosted a table with
brochures alerting students to the
negative impact of alcohol and ways
for students to seek rehabilitation.

' Residence Life ‘offered students

free “mocktails,” mocktail recipes, a
petition for students to pledge not to
drink and drive and black ribbons to
acknowledge alcohol awareness.

' Ashley Lynch, a McCormick Hall
resident assistant, said that all the
RAs will be wearing black ribbons to
show that they are aware of the 'nega-
tive effects of alcohol. t

“The black ribbon campaign is

e our biggest thing,” she said.

Freshman Lisa Mauro_ stopped by

. the table to sample a mocktail and

take a few black ribbons.

“I don’t think a lot of students
understand the effects of alcohol and
how dangerous it can be,” Mauro
said. .

On the lower level of the William

Pitt Union, a health check table fea-

tured a blood pressure station in addi-
tion to free mugs and anti-alcohol

The Student Government Board’s
Proposition A referendum passed with near-
ly 75 percent of the vote yesterday. The ref-
erendum placed voting ‘booths in the
Cathedral, Towers Lobby, and the William
Pitt Union, asking students whether they
-were in favor of changing SGB’s election

— » cycle from November to April. ’ : A
A total of 836 ‘students voted in the ref- .

erendum, -constituting less than 6 percent of
the total eligible student body. SGB
Elections chair Carrie Hoover said she was-
n’t surprised by the low tumout.

“Actually, it’s’ more than I expected,”
she said. Constitutional Review Committee
member Brent Miller agreed.

“It was a good tumour, but not great,”
Miller said. “The large margin is comforting.
I think that the message did get out and made
a signiﬁcant showing for the SG .”

Lisa Bass, SGB’s Multicultural Council

_ chair, manned a polling location almost all

day yesterday. She was unimpressed by the
voter turnout. —

“A lot of people don’t understand the
importance of voting in general, whether for
SGB, a referendum or the upcoming presi-
dential election,” Bass said. “One vote can
make a difference.” -

Faculty senate discusses rising costs

LAUREN RADOM
Staff Writer

Pitt faculty and staff members gasped
yesterday when Rush Miller, director of
the. University Library ‘System, said the
Journalof Comparative Neurology now
costs'$15,000, compared to the $1,920 it
was Worth in 1985. '

. Miller, in a presentation at the
University‘ Senate’s fall plenary session,
expressed the library’s perspective on what
he called the scholarly communication cri-
sis.

Other speakers included Provost and
Senior Vice Chancellor James Maher, and
Evelyn Rawski, a professor of history and
international studies research. Nathan
Hershey, president of University Senate,
served as a moderator.

The discussion, held in Wﬂharn Pitt
Union Assembly Room, focused mainly
on how the current system of scholarly
publishing has become too costly for the
academic community to sustain.

“Libraries are the primary market for
' scholarly publications,” Miller said.

“There has been a tremendous explosion

of resources to libraries in the past 40 _

years.” . ,
But Miller stressed that journal publi-

cations are driving out other types of pub- . A

lications, and on average their prices have
inﬂated 12 percent a year. The average
price of a library subscription to a physics
journal is $1,500. . -

According to . an Association of
Research Libraries Web site, the increasing
volume and costs of scholarly publications,
particularly in science, technology and
medicine, are Inaking it impossible for
libraries to maintain the collection needs of
faculty and students

Luckily though, this has not been a
tremendous issue for Pitt.

,“The University of Pittsburgh has
been insulated a greatdeal ﬁom this phe-
nomenon,” Miller said. “It has been going
on more at other universities. We haven’t
had a plenary session. on this before
because we haven’t felt this crisis before.”

Miller also addressed the growing;

problem with large commercial publishers
buying out smaller ones.

"They absorb each other like a Pac-
- Man game,” Miller said.

“They absorb other houses and presses
without us even watching. Mergers have
more impact than anything else,” he said.

Miller also made suggestions on how
faculty and staff can make a difference in
an effort to stave ‘oﬁ this growing problem.
The Scholarly Publishing and Academic
Resources Coalition is one group that con-
tributes to the cause, introducing new jour-
nals as well as working with publishers to
allow faculty to keep copyrights at lower
prices. t V

Maher spoke next, and said that every-
thing Miller said was not only true, but also
troubling. ‘

“The problems go far beyond ﬁnances
and really go to the root of scholarship,”
Maher said.

Right: Carpenter’s
friends helped him
carry out his sur-
prise proposal.

In front of the Cathedral of
Learning, amid blooming flowers
and water streaming from a panther
head, Doug Carpenter proposed to
Misty Gilchrist.

She said yes.

The couple began dating during
their sophomore year of high school
and are now seniors at Pitt.

“I picked the Cathedral because
it’s my favorite place on campus,”
Carpenter said. “Since this
University has been a major part of

my life and our relationship, it will
really mean something to look back
at this moment.” ~

Carpenter, an athletic training
major, proposed on his birthday.
Gilchrist, an information science
major, is 21, and both are from New
Brighton, Pa.

“I hope that my future with
Misty will symbolize what the
Cathedral means to this
University,” Carpenter said.

Loud voices andlmusic boomed from

I Sutherland Ha]1’s cafeteria as residents

enjoyed Karaoke Night on two occasions in
the past three weeks. Sponsored by the
Sutherland Hall , Resident Student’
Association, both nights were packed with
food and fim.

The RSA offered free sandwiches,
brownies, cookies, cake and soda pop to
attendees. Using the sound system in the
cafeteria, the RSA staff overpowered the
voices from musical recordings with those
of the ampliﬁed karaoke singers.

Resident assistants served as judges,
and they scored the singers based on accura-
cy, style and overall performance. For the
second event, the staff added a fourth cate-
gory — Bust’n a Move.

The ﬁrst karaoke event took place on
Sept 26. Although there were 200 residents
in the audience, only 18 performed. A wide
array of songs by artists from Christina
Aguilera to Erninern echoed through
Sutherland’s lobby. Prizes were awarded for
a three—way tie between Sutherland residents
James Bell, Stephen Sherman and Danielle
Rebosky. The winners received a variety of

included 10 participants and 155 resident
supporters. However, some of the partici-

pants performed more than once. All win-
ners received one froe ticket to Fright Fest, as

with their duct to a Dr. Dre and 9

Eminem song, Sutherland residents Matt
Sheldon and Andy Herr won first place.
Corinn Trochowski placed second in the
event, and Rebosky again claimed a prize
when she took third. 9'

According to RSA director Neil
Parliam, the staﬂ is looking for feedback and
will only plan another karaoke night if they
sense interest among the residents.

If a karaoke event is planned for
November, there may be an entrance fee of
$1. This fee will assist Sutherland in the
Lothrop Challenge, a friendly competition
among residence halls conducted during ﬂie
month of November.

In this competition, all of the residence
halls collect donations for the charity of their
choice. The amount raised in each building
is divided by the total number of students liv-
ing there to determine which building wins.

According to Parham, if thc karaoke A

competitions continue, residents may take
take the place of the RAs inthe judging.

“It seemed that the judges we'rcn’t judg-
ing according to what they should be judg-
ing,” Rebosky said. .

But, the two—time karaoke winner said
she still had a good time.

“Overall, I think it’s a great event,” she
said. .

brochures.

Residence Life is also coordinat-
ing more events throughout October
to increase students’ awareness of the
repercussions of alcohol use.

The “Art as Awareness” campaign
is collecting submissions of student
art which portray alcohol in a nega-
tive light. Students can submit art to
their RA or to the Residence Life
office in Towers lobby until the end of
October. The art will be displayed in
Towers lobby.

Resident Director‘ Michele
Griffith said the “Art as Awareness”
campaign had about 15 submissions
last year, and that Residence Life
hopes to receive at least that many
this year.

Residence Life plans to install
“The Wall that Alcohol Built”-in the
lobbies of Towers, Sutherland,

McCormick and Brackenridge. The

wall is a place for students to write
about their negative experiences with
alcohol.

Residence Life also hopes to start
an organization for Pitt students who
do not drink. Surveys conducted by
the University reveal that 20 percent
of students do not drink.

“It’s hard for students to find a
group of friends that don’t drink,”
Griffith said.

Miller mentioned, Maher also addressed‘
problems with electronic publishing and
new legislature about intellectual property.

“Electronic publication is here, and
it’s having an impact already,” Maher said.
“People don’t know how to take advan-
tage of it.”

According to SPARC, some of the
major problems with electronic publica-
tion are that small publishers and universi-
ty presses do not have the money to invest

FROM PAGE 1

‘in new media to publish electronically.

Also, libraries are concerned that they will
not have the ability to preserve these jour-
nals long—terrn. _ -

“Scholarship could not go on if that
communication is inhibited,” Maher said.

He added that he has access to every
publication in his ﬁeld at an affordable
cost and knows that his colleagues have
access to it as well. Maher said that facul-
ty at other universities do not enjoy the
same privileges.

Rawski had other problems with the
publishing business. V

“When I ﬁrst started my career, it was
much harder to get published,” Rawski
said. “Access in my ﬁeld and dream is
global. It was completely impossible 20
years ago.”

“I think it is time for faculty to get
down to very nitIy—gn'tty concerns over
electronic publishing,” Rawski said. “It’s
not going to go away.”

OPINIONS

EDITORIAL

Voter apathy is (a)pathetic

Yesterday, Pitt students voted
to change the elections for Student
Government Board members from
November to April to coincide
with the school year.

Maybe we should not say stu-
dents, but rather some students, as
only 836 of roughly 14,000 eligi-
ble students tumed out to vote —
less than 6 percent.

In other words, only 6 percent
of students made a decision for
everyone else.

Here are a couple of possibili-
ties for why this happened. First,.
the lack of publicity on the referen-
dum caused the low voter turnout
directly. There was almost no,
advertising until the night before
the election — even though the
Constitutional Review Committee
did an admirable job of plastering
the campus with posters then, it
was too late. Many students proba-
bly did not feel they could make an
informed decision about the issue.

A second (and related) possi-
bility is that the lack of publicity
beforehand led to a lack of debate
on the subject, which led to a lack
of knowledge and then led, once
again, to the lack of voter turnout.
Very little public debate occurred
leading up to this election, espe-
cially in comparison to the amount
of publicity and discussion we’re
seeing for the national elections

this year. Although those certainly
merit more publicity, the amount
this referendum received is just
pathetic.

There is a third possibility —
students just don’t care. Many
would suggest that this is the case
and would also say that this is very
reasonable; after all, what rele-
vance does SGB have for us? p

Even though you may think
that SGB does not do anything else
important, they indeed d9 one very
important thing.

Every semester each student
pays a $60 activities fee. As any of
you who belong to a club very well
know, SGB decides how to spend
that money.

Think about how much money
that is. You could buy 14 Antoon’s
pizzas withit! If you want money
for your organization and don’t
want to be reduced to selling tins
of cookies, you, turn to SGB
because they decide where the
money goes. ,.

Voting on SGB issues is a big
deal — this past election will cer-
tainly help ‘determine who serves
on the board for this term, and they
in turn will determine if your club
gets the money it needs.

So next time, let’s have more
than 6 percent of us making a deci-
sion on who should spend all of
our hard—earned money.

Political correctness through the

eyes of a self-proclaimed idiot

I am an idiot I’m not proud of it and I do
blame my parents for giving me a hereditary
template for idiocy. I tell you I am stupid so you
can understand exacﬂy where I am coming
from

I spend most of my time with my fraternity
brothers, relaxing by discussing football, drink-
ing a few beers and watching MTV. I have an
intelligent friend who tried explain-

ing to me that ‘The Real World” is SEAN
SNYDER

the Zeitgeist of our generation. But
unless you talk really slowly, I can’t
understand you. ‘
One day, while I talking on my
cell phone, standing there in my Abercrombie
apparel and basically being a sellout to the whole
image of conformity, I overheard my intelligent
friend speaking. He was expounding on his the-
ory that political correctness is a form of censor-

ship and by adhering to it you are perpetuating it. ‘

He ended by saying that “retards should be made
fun of for being retards.” I was appalled — how
could anyone be so insensitive? Later on, I found
out he was using sarcasm to prove a point, but I
didn’t know what theword “sarcasm” meant
He also saidthatbecausethese issues areso
taboo and serious, they should therefore be

deﬂated and trivialized, otherwise people who

are idiots may take oifense and start ﬁstﬁghts. At
this point I wasn’t listening, because I had

already started a ﬁstﬁght

The next morning, after waking up and
introducing myself to the sorority sister who

change. I promised myself that I would drop out
of business school and devote my life to trying
to censor what other people say. I found that
political correctness is predicated on the subtext
of curbing slurs about stereotypes so as to avoi
offending others. '
I may not be smart, but this makes perfect
sense to me. If you tell a joke that 50 people
laugh at, but one person ﬁnds “insensitive,” then
you have no right whatsoever to ever repeat that
joke. I propose we write to Congress asking

  

S'I3\rI~‘ WRI'I‘I~tR

them to make it illegal to use any terms that any
special interest groups ﬁnd inappropriate.

As a logical extension from spoken words,
we really have to increase the censorship of
books. Everyone knows that the two greatest
things to ever happen to this country are censor-
.ship and the Vietnam War. If Germany had just
censored speech, and realized that political cor-
‘ rectness is speech censorship,
Hitler would never had succeeded.
If they had simply gone to Hitler
and said, “Hitler, you are not being
nice. Stop being that way,” he
would have given up power right
there. He was a reasonable guy with reasonable
needs (to those who ﬁnd that comment to be
serious, thank you for proving my point).

We live in a “community,” and it is time we
all become equal, time to place computer chips
in our heads to give people an elecuic shock if
they make a racial slur, and time to start censor-
ing anything that anyone may ﬁnd offensive. As

a future parent in the community, I pledge that

not only will my kids he saved from so—called
‘fcorrupt literature,” .I will also make sure that
your kids can’t read it either. Don’t thank me,
just thank the public school system

And ﬁnally, a concerned student recently
wrote an article in the Pitt News stating that by
censoring books, we nearly guarantee to pro-
voke the child’s desire to read said outlawed

. book. This is absolutely true. Therefore, I advo-

cate not so much book censorship, but book
burning. I invite all students to join me next
Saturday at some location on campus to have a
book burning celebration. We will be saving the
children from “ﬁlth.” Bring your Shakespeare
(that anti—Sernitic, male chauvinistic garbage)

and your Wilde, Twain, Salinger, Kipling,-

Melville and even Dr. Seuss. It will be a giant
leap forward for all of us. What can I say? I am
an idiot.

icism” means.

' was purely one of dissent and

President Ralph Nader’s inauguration speech

The following are‘ excerpts from the
inauguration speech given by President
Ralph Nader on Jan. 20, 2001 :

“Just four months ago, from the beach-
es of San Francisco to the streets of New

’ York City, there was not a single newspa-

per, television news program nor periodical
that predicted the events that were to 11nfold
this past Nov. 7. There was the speculation,
of course, that my candidacy

JEFF

not of aspiration. There was a T
whoHy undemocratic dis-
missal of my campaign for the
presidency as a spoiler for the

liberal cause. But the American "people

knew better.

“The American people realized, after
more than a century of partisan politics, that
the advice from their ﬁrst -and perhaps
greatest president, George Washington, had
gone unheeded for too long. In his farewell
address, Washington, with wisdom that tra-
verses the 204 years that have passed since

the left office, said of political parties,

‘However combinations or associations
may now and then answer to popular ends,
they are likely in the course of time and
things to become potent engines by which
cunning, ambitious, and unprincipled men
will be enabled to subvert the power. of the
people, and to usurp for themselves ' the
reins of government, destroying afterwards

' the very engines which have  them to

MURRAY

 

unjust dominion.’

“And though the great engine of
American democracy, bearing‘ the full
weight of liberty and justice, had nearly
been ﬂooded with disillusionment and
nearly stalled by the inﬂuence of corporate
and special interests, the very gears, joints
and pistons of that stalling engine reversed
their own decay just before there would be
nothing left to recover. This
was truly the second American
Revolution.

“It was not a revolution
bathed in blood but a revolution
bathed in ballots — the voices
of rational dissent wo11ld no longer be mar-
ginalized, and so they were magniﬁed.

“The _ petty debates between
Republicans and Democrats, so devoid of
Substance, were at last perceived for their
true nature: diversionary tactics undertaken
to veil the corporate interests both parties
represent. ‘Why else would they exclude me
from not only from participating in the
debates but- also illegally bar me ﬁom. even
attending as an audience member with my
ticket in hand? They became the embodi-
ment of George Washington’s premonition
— or «should I say nightmare?

- “My election‘ was a vindication of age-
old value systems eroding away in a com-
mercialized culture: the value of people
over proﬁt, solidarity over partisanship,

‘ valuing the earth not as a commodity to be

exploited but as _a home to be maintained. It
was a vindication of the democratic ideals
our forefathers envisioned two and a quar-
ter centuries ago.

“'The American people have spoken.
No longer will we enter into trade organi-
zations or agreements that sacriﬁce our
dedication to human rights, democratic
ideals and environmental protection. No
longer will we deny the right of labor to
organize and work for a living wage, better
working conditions and increased involve-
ment in managerial decisions. We must
repeal the Taft—Hartley Act, which has put a
stranglehold on labor organizations, clearly
tipping the balance in labor-management
relations in the favor of corporate bosses.

I “No longer will we give away publicly
ﬁnanced scientiﬁc advancements, such as
medicines and other technologies, to corpo-
rations who tum around and sell those same
technologies at inﬂated prices to the very
taxpayers who subsidized their develop-
ment.

“No longer will the richest and most
powerful nation the world has ever known
deny its citizens universal health care and
lifelong education opportunities. A healthi-
er, more educated society will increase pro-
ductivity, efficiency and creativity, and will

‘ ﬁnally retum trust in government.

“The undisputed and most recogniz-
able symptoms of social and economic
injustice, those of crime and drug use,

intrinsically linked to poverty, will only
subside when the government provides
more for opportunity than policing, more
for education than military expansion, and

more for the public welfare than for corpo- '

rate welfare.

“We must become the model of a mod-
ern democracy, not the agent of its enforce-
ment. We must also recognize our fault in
perpetuating dictatorships in Central and
South America, Africa, Asia and the
Paciﬁc. Authoritarian leaders of third world

nations, however hospitable to American»

corporate interests they may be, will not be
coddled by this administration.

“American corporations that seek to
take advantage of such nations under polit-
ical and social oppression, that capitalize on
the native workers’ inability to organize

themselves for better working conditions,

and pay, will face serious consequences for
their actions at home.

“Today we begin rebuilding the values
of economic and social justice at home, so
that tomorrow we may speak to the world
not in endless strings of hypocritical
rhetoric but with sincerity in the values of
democracy and liberty we hold sacro-
sanct.”

It never hurts to dream.

Jeff Murray believes that this dream could
be a reality and that we should all get out

. and vote our true consciences on Nov. 7.

Identifying

Perhaps you’ve noticed lately
that many have portrayed media vio-
lence as a looming evil ready to
devour America’s youth in a ravenous
corruption of values. Some of the
players in this nasty game are
Eminem and Nike."

Be realistic for a moment,
though. The notion that 30 seconds of
a TV commercial or 60 seconds of a
movie preview can drive an other-
wise emotionally healthy youth to

’manifest the negative aspects, of

media exposure is‘ ludicrous. To
absolve an American youth of some
criminal act or intent and to eliminate
the responsibility of that youth’s par-
ents by laying blame on a media
product is negligent of us as a soci-
ety. ‘ ,
It seems that the easily-inﬂu-
enced and over-reactionary members
of American» society need constant
distraction. And so shallow crusades
against distilled villains come in and

out of vogue like boy bands and

leather pants. In this case, the archen—
emy of the overly” serious is media
violence, and because it will sell,
many outlets of “respectable” media
have decided to take up this -cause as
well. V S’ ‘

Wake up, America 4 it’s impos-

sible to:blame- media imagery for the
results of bad parenting. If a young
person’s grip on morality is so tenu-
ous that something as culturally
remote as a rap album or a Nike ad
can drive him or her to commit vio-
lent or sexually—depraved acts, there

absolutely must have been a failure

on the part of those whose responsi-
bility it was to raise that youth.

It’s very simple: When a child is
well-taught from_ an early age to
make rational, morally correct deci-
sions and to accept responsibility for

‘the consequences of bad decisions,

no media product will be able to sig-
nificantly affectitheir morality. When

parents take the time to teach their

children solid decision-‘making skills
and then set a good example by using

~ those skills themselves, their children

will not make the kind of negative
decisions that lead to the violent acts
so often blamed on the media.

' I know what you’re thinking: But
Sabrina, what, about when bad kids.
come out of good houses? Yes, that
does happen sometimes. But if a per-
son’s parents actually set "a moral
standard that a child abandons later in
life in a fit of rebelliousness, America
still cannot blame a media product
but must blame the person instead.

This radical idea is called person-
al responsibility — when a young
, adult commits a violent act, blame it
‘on him or her! It is not the fault of
Marilyn Manson, Dr. Dre, the pro-
ducers of Scream I through XXVI or
the porn industry at large. The indi-
vidual raised his fist in anger, the
individual made a vulgar gesture and
the individual pulled the
trigger. Therefore, it’s the
individual’s fault.
Don’t misunderstand me
— I personally do not agree
with a lot of the messages
ﬂoating ‘around in the media today.
‘Violence is not an acceptable form of
conﬂict resolution, it is not OK to
objectify women and it is not right to
judge someone on the basis of his or

0 her race, spirituality or sexual orien-

tation. And I will agree that the media
seemingly projects more than its fair
share of these messages.

But nevertheless, when a young
person assimilates and acts on these
messages,» we cannot blame the peo-
ple who threw them out for public
consumption: the creators of these‘
messages are just trying to make a
buck.’ The media is not responsible

A for creating the kind of nurturing

thereal culprits ofyouth violence

choices and responsible morality in
young people — that is the responsi-
bility of parents and parents alone. If
they fail, it’s their fault. '

Likewise, the media is not
responsible for negative acts commit-
ted by an individual. It’s the responsi-
bility of that individual to know what
is right and what is wrong. If he or
she fails in the decision-
making process and com-
mits some sin against
society, it’s that person’s
fault and no one else’s.

I’m not trying to put
myself on a moral pedestal —— I do
bad things sometimes too. When I
was young, it was my mother’s fault
for not making sure I knew how to
behave responsibly. Today, it’s my
own fault for choosing to do the
wrong thing, even when I know
what’s right.

So let’s stop blaming the media
for an individual’s poor decisions.
Then we can start blaming the media
for the things for which they’re real-
ly responsible, like reality shows and
Britney Spears.

Sabrina Spiher would like tosay that,
yes, she knows she is bitter and can-
tankerous.

Do you remember Halloween?
Sure you do —— rubbery plastic cos-
tumes with eyeholes that you couldn’t
see out of, dragging your overstuffed
pillowcase down your cold, mucky
neighborhood street, convincing your
parents that the apple the little old lady
from across the road gave you could
be filled with razor blades, but you
were sure the chocolate was fine.

If you want to grab a pillowcase
and go door to door reliving your
childhood, by all means go ahead. I
promise that I personally will give you
candy if I see you. On the other hand,
a slightly more low—key alternative is
the haunted house. Haunted houses are
relatively cheap, easy to get to and
every now and then, they’re scary.

Fright Fest

Probably the largest haunted house
in Pittsburgh is the Super Phar-Mor
Fright Fest at the .IC Light

Amphitheatre. Phar—Mor has been '

sponsoring this frightening event for
six years. Station Square is easily
accessible by PAT bus, and Pitt is
sponsoring a trip on Oct. 20.

Fright Fest features three walk-
through attractions: the Haunted
House, Forbidden Skull and the new
Clown Asylum. The Haunted House
has your run—of-the—mill scary stuff
including witches, vampires, chain
saw wielding weirdos and the like that
jump out at you from dark corridors.
Unfortunately, in many sections of the
house, it’s so dark and. smoky that you
can’t see what’s supposed to be scar-
ing you.

Forbidden Skull is similar but with

less smoke and more lurking monsters.

Clown Asylum consistently has
the shortest lines. It was the least
scary, but deﬁnitely worth experienc-
ing. Above the entrance is a large pro-
jection screen that plays movies such
as “Killer Clowns” and Stephen
King’s “It.” On the roof, clowns pick
their big red noses and swing around

black leatherstraps. I’m not quite sure‘
’ what effect they were going for with

that.

Clown Asylum is definitely trippy.
The attraction is in 3-D, so you get to
wear those oh--so-fashionable card-

board glasses. The entire house is

painted in day-glow and accented with
black lights.
that went through were busy touching
the walls and reaching out for paint-
ings to see if they were raised. The
asylum isn’t really scary unless you

have a fear of clowns, like the girl.

behind me in line did. While the evil
clowns weren’t allowed to touch her,
they taunted the poor thing until she
was in tears.

In addition to the three walk— _

through attractions, Fright Fest has
carnival rides, hot chocolate, candy
apples, games of chance and a clown-

‘ dunking booth. Drown the Clown was-

North Park. This year’s Terrors by the
Lake donates its proceeds to the Make-
A—Wish Foundation. In going, you
would also support local artists — stu-

dents of the Art Institute of Pittsburgh,

designed the rooms.

The haunted house has different
theme rooms, including a morgue, a
skeleton room, a gargoyles room, a
slime room and a train room. Watch
out for the train room — it isn’t scary,

"but it sure is loud. When you exit the

house, the scares continue as you walk
outside onto a haunted trail, and at the

end of the trail is a large wooden «

maze. As you try to navigate your way
out, you’ll bump into other confused
fear-seekers. Adding to the complica-
tion are the strobe lights and lurking
ghouls.

Terrors by the Lake also has a sec-
ond, smaller haunted house — actual-
ly, it’s more like a haunted trailer. Its
narrow halls and scary scenes are a
complementary transition from the big

There’s also carnival games and
autumn treats. I recommend the tasty
and affordable caramel apple slices.
North Park is easiest to get to by
car. Take Route 279 to McKnight
Road, and then follow the signs to

North Park. Terrors by the Lake is on .

Pearce Mill Road, near the tennis
courts. It’s a little hard to find, but just
keep driving, and look for the lights.

South Park runs a similar haunted
house, Phantoms in the Park. Its pro-
ceeds also benefit the Make—A—Wish
Foundation. -

USS Nightmare

If you go to only, one haunted 

event this Halloween season, make it
the USS Nightmare at -the Gateway
Clipper Fleet dock at Station Square.
The boat doesn’t sail, so there’s no risk
of seasickness. However, there are
plenty of sick things to see and step
around. ,
The theme for the haunted ship is
based on the legend of The Wakerobin.
The captain of the Wakerobin report-
edly had a seance, which unleashed a

‘ team of evil spirits that sank the boat

in the Ohio River. Each year it sur-
faces, and aren’t we lucky for that.
