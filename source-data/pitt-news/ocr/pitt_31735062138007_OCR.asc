Campbell Elected
To Fill Vacancy
In SFA Council

Lounge For Both Men, Women,
Football Holiday Discussed
At Dinner Meeting

BodyMeets November 13

Members of the University Assem-
bly, guests of Dr. John G_ Bowman,
Chancellor of the University, met for
the first time in the University club
Tuesday evening.

“This is one of the most important
University meetings of the year,” Dr.
Bowman declared in welcoming the
legislators. “There are great things
that you can do here as the student
governing body, and I wish you suc-
cess in your work.” '

After thanking DI‘, Bowman for his
interest in the Assembly, Leonard
Marks, C35, president of the body, an-
nounced the selection of three com-
mittees: the Appointments commit-
tee, headed by Don Campbell, C35;
the Organizations group, led by Homer
Wadsworth, C35; and the Social com-
mittee, with Wilson Loos as chair-
man. Each of the men brieﬂy ex-
plained his work to date.

Campbell was elected to the vacan-
cy in the Executivecommittee occa-
sioned by the resignation of. King
Derr, C35, Other candidates for the
position were Helen Milliron, C35, and
Marion E.pping, BA35.

Appointment of a committee to in-
vestigate the advisability of fresh-
man customs for men followed dis-
cussion of ﬁrst-year programs. Wo-
men members of the Assembly spoke
in favor of the women's orientation
plan now in use, and suggested that
a. similar system be adopted for men.

On motion of Frank Reich, C36, ap-
pointment of a Constitutional com-

mittee was likewise voted. “It is ne-
cessary,” Marks asserted, “that the
SFA constitution remain a plastic

one, adapted to changing conditions.
A permanent committee handling the
subject of revisions‘ and additions
will keep us always up—to—date.”
Another-duty was imposed upon the
Executive committee when the As-
sembly voted to consider a University
lounge for both men and women.

Lengthy discussion of authorized foot-‘

ball holidays after major victories re-
sulted only in the tabling of the sub-
ject.

The second Tuesday or each month
was chosen as the regular meeting
time of the body,

A speakers’ committee was recom-
mended to contact prominent men for
campus appearances.

The Alumni Review, a new maga-
zine published by the General Alumni

the University. The magazine, pub-
lished seven times a year, will contain
articles on campus affairs.

Pictures of the campus and cam-

‘ pus organizations will be numerous.

The majority of the articles will be
written by present members of the
faculty who know the progress of the
organizations. Aside from the news,
of the campus, a portion of the book
will be concerned with the activities
of the graduates a_nd the changes in
the University administration.

Inquiry Speaker
Raps New Deal  
As ‘Socialistic’

Coleman Dubs Present Condition‘
Result Of Artiﬁcial Rise;
Praises Reed, Schnader

By Thomas Pellow

Declaring, “The present administra-
tion in Washington is neither Demo-
cratic nor Republican, but socialistic,”
VV. H. Coleman, Republican county
chairman, addressed the Inquiry
forum Wednesday.

Coleman, who received an enthusi-
astic ovation from his audience, com-
mented on the Republican candidates
Reed and Schnader, and severely criti-
cized the Democratic platform and

the New Deal.

Commenting on the administration
Coleman said: “Two of the chief fea-;
tures of the Democratic platform were '
that the budget must be balanced and
the gold standard preserved. Never
has the budget been more out of bal-
ance than it is at present; and if
anyone can tell where the gold stand-,
ard has gone, he is a whole lot wiser
than I.”

Centering his attack on the New
Deal, Coleman declared: “It is utter-
ly wrong, and my whole being rebels
against it. A year ago the cost of
hogs was $4.60, now it is $8.15. This
is an artiﬁcial rise, and has nothing
to do with the law of supply and de-
mand.

"The theory of the Democrats and
President Roosevelt, who is surround-
ed by a group of politically inexp-eri-
enced professors, is that they must
restore prices to the 1926 ‘level, and

“lHow can the killing of hogs and
steers, and the destroying of corn
and wheat be justified when there,__
are people starving to death? Instead,
of paying money to destroy produce,‘
how much better it would be to use
it to transport it to needy people.
The folly of high prices is that they
have never made prosperity in this
world, The New Dealers are on the
wrong track.

“The one thing that has been the
greatest help in the Democrats’ at-
tempt to better conditions in the
country is the Reconstruction Finance.
corporation. This is the real machin-
ery that has been used, and it was
laid down by the Republicans.”

In. regard to old age pensions,
which it is claimed the Republicans
tried to prevent, Coleman stated: “I
am wholly i11 favor of old age pen-
sions_ A reasonable pension can be
paid to these individuals at as low an
expense as it would cost to keep them
in an institution, and by the D8-Ylllellt
of a pension family life can be kept
intact.”

Commenting on he Republican
candidates Reed and Schnader, Cole-
man said: “Reed is a member of the
old school, and therefore is notmuch
in favor of the New Deal. There is
no question in regard to his ability.
He is one of the ablest men in the
Senate. He stands ﬁrmly for his con-
victions and does not cater to public
opinion.

“Schnader is the best equipped man
who has been a candidate for gov-
ernor in my experience. He has
served as Attorney—General during the
last" three administrations and is
therefore well qualiﬁed in political
administration in Pennsylvania.”

Petitions For Freshman

Dance Available Today

Petitions for the chairmanship of
the Freshman dance are available to-
day in Room 801, Cathedral.

These petitions must be signed by
25 freshmen and be returned to the
ofﬁce of the dean of men, Room 801,
Cathedral, by Wednesday at 4 o’clock.
No person may sign more than one
petition.

Petitions will be checked by the
Appointments committee of SFA and
will be recommended to the Executive
committee for the appointment,

Turkey Progresses, Egypt Remains
Conservative In Westernizing Trend

“Modern Turkey and modern Egypt
are a study in contrasts,” said Donald
B, Atwell, YMCA worker in Egypt, in
an address before the Engineers club
Wednesday.

According to Mr. Atwell, who spent
over a decade in these countries, Tur-
key is rapidly becoming westernized
while Egypt is still essentially con-
servative_

In Turkey the Koran has been
translated and the Dervishes, a fanat-
ical sect, have been suppressed. The
country has embarked on a program
of complete economic independence,
and the ancient Moslem law has been
replaced by the Swiss code.

“In Egypt,” said Mr, Atwell, “there
has been little sign of change. Al-
though the veil and fez have been put
under penalty in Turkey, in Egypt
nearly everyone still wears them. It
would not be safe for an Egyptian
woman to appear on the streets with-

out a veil, although many women of.

the upper classes wear a veil of such
light material that it is almost trans-
-parent.”

There is still a strong feeling in
Em/‘Pt against England, Mr. Atwell dis-
closed. Although there has been no

outbreak since 1919, many prominent

Belated Rushing
Results Indicate
Membership Drop

24 Additional Bid Acceptances
Fail By 50 To Equal
Last Year’s Total

Twenty-four men have belatedly
accepted bids to compus social frater-

nities, it has been disclosed by the
office of the dean of men.

The formal period of rushing for}
men’s social fraternities officially end-:
ed at 5 o’clock Thursday afternoon,{
October 18, at which time 124 rushees
had signiﬁed intentions of pledging.‘
The new group brings the total for
the semester to 148——at least 50 less
than the number for the ﬁrst semester
of last year,

N. Robert Seidle, assistant to the
dean of men, reported that the dean’s
office is particularly gratiﬁed by the
conduct of the season this year_ Not
one violation of the rushing code was,
reported to him, he stated, and, “on:
the whole, the fraternities behaved
like groups of true gentlemen.”

In the past years, it has been a usual
occurrence for individual fraternities
to be scored for unfair rushing tactics,
some of which have led to fines or sus-
pension of social privileges.

The new pledges, who have signed
acceptance cards over the last week,
are:

Delta Tau Delta—-E.dward Sutton.

Kappa Sigma——VVilliam Knotts, John
1\lcGrath, and Gerald G-owers.

Lambda Chi Alpha—Eugene
can. -

Phi Epsilon Pi—I-lerbert
and Irwin Solow.

Phi Gamma Delta———Willia.m Ham-
mett, Gail Rose, and VVilliam Jones.

Phi Ka.ppa—Frank Souchak.

Pi Kappa Alpha—Jack Davis, Taylor
Johnson, and Alan Smart.

Pi Lambda Phi—-Irwin Hecht.

Sigma Alpha Epsilon—l-‘Villiam K.

and Jaye Gamble.

Sigma Alpha Mu—Bernard Trumper,

wood Hunker, and Robert Howell.

Denial Journai

Dental Rays, the official publication
of the School of Dentistry, has also
been made the official publication for
the Dental Alumni association. The
first issue will appear about Novem-
ber 20-, and copies will be sent to 2,500
alumni, as well as undergraduates.
Jess Pennington, D-35, co-manager of
the varsity football team, has been
appointed student editor of the publi-
cation. An alumni board and an ad-
visory board control the policies of
the new set~up.

The new Dental Rays will have an
entirely different form than in previ-
ous years and will have a new cover
of black and white. All material will
be presented in a more digniﬁed an.d
professional manner, according to Dr.
T. F. McBride, faculty director of the
publication.

The journal will feature alumni in
formatio_n, student notes, dental-med-
icine abstracts and contributions, and
a dental calendar for the news of fra-
ternities, classes, and alumni.

Williams Speaks Tonight

Dun-

ltackoff,

 

 

Dr. Samuel H, Williams, professor
of zoology, will speak before a group
of Xvestmoreland county sportsmen
this evening in Jeannette. Tomorrow
afternoon he will address the south-
west section oflthe Pennsylvania State
Education association at Beaver Falls
on “Biological studies in South Amer-
ma.”

Egyp-tians believe that England has
not granted Egypt the complete inde-
pendence promised, and that foreign
influences have been active against
the complete modernization of the
country.

“Turkey is poor in natural re-
sources, while Egypt is comparative-
ly rich, Cairo and Alexandria are up-
to-date cities with concrete roads and
electric lights, but Istanbul, formerly
Constantinople, is not.”

Egypt is conservative in matters of
education, it was pointed out. Classes
are still conducted in the old Moslem
fashion of sitting on the ﬂoor in a
circle around the teacher,

Fanaticism is widespread and there
are frequent persecutions of the Jews
and Christians by the Moslems.

In Turkey, under the leadership of
Mustapha Kemal .Pasha, there is a
well organized westernizing move-
ment. European dress, and methods
of education are being introduced.
Men and women mingle freely in oc-
cidental fashion, and the Miss Europe
of a recent year was a. Turkish girl.
In Egypt, conditions are still,practical-
ly unchanged, although polygamy is
practiced rarely because of the high
cost.

Journalists’ Convention

Fails To Act On Guild

The silver anniversary convention
of Sigma Delta Chi which met at De-
Pauw university, Greencastle, Indiana,
October 19, 20, and 21, was the most
successful in the history of the na-
tional professional journalistic frater-
nity, according to Omer E. Kronen-
wetter, delegate for the University
chapter, who returned Monday eve-
ning, '

The principal business of the con-
vention was the discussion of the
American Newspaper Guild, which has
been brought to the notice of the en-
tire country in the past year. No def-
inite action was taken on the Guild
matter, but general sentiment seemed
not to favor it in connection with the
fraternity.

John C, Semple, of the New York
Sun, was elected president for the
coming year, and Frank S. Knox, pub-
lisher of the Chicago ,.Daily News was
initiated as an associate member in
a model initiation ceremony.

I-Iell Week Flickers
ECAUSE a university “is ob-
ligated to protect the health
and well-being of all students un-
der its supervision and to justify
the faith and conﬁdence placed in
it by parents and patrons,” the
University of Southern California
has just abolished fraternity pad-
dling, tubbing and “Hell \Veek.”

Here are the practices speciﬁc-
ally prohibited by the U.S.C.
edict: paddling, tubbing, expos-
ure, deprivation of sleep below a
daily minimum of seven hours,
any kind of rough handling, and
dictating orders to pledges by
other than designated fraternity
ofﬁcials.

Aside from these checks, frater-
nities at Southern California are
at liberty to raise hell.

For solace, houses are to substi-
tute a “probationary week,” dur-
ing which period pledges are to
do constructive work about the
house after school hours. Pledges
who fail to perform ofﬁcially des-
ignated tasks will be penalized
only by a “black” rating on a,
fraternity merit scale—this to be
established by the Interfrateriiity
council for universal enforcement
by fraternities. _

Slowly the lusty, ungrown and
unconﬁned glory of college life as
it carried over from the ’90s is
passing away. Future generations
of U.S.C. old grads are to remeni-
ber Hell ‘Week as the time they
painted the kitchen ceiling or
sewed the library curtains, in-
stead of the time they performed
I-Ierculean or Gargantuan prodi-
gies that grow in the memory
from telling.

And just to show that U.S.C.
fraternities and those here have
much in common, we offer the fol-
lowing statement by Rufus B.
von KleinS1iiid, president of the
University of Southern Califor-
nia:

“For several years past, uiii-

hats and the lesser indignities for
freshmen, the committee should
ponder the orientation practices
of other urban universities and
the methods used here to acquaint
new women students with Univer-
ity of Pittsburgh folkways.

CPSF

TUDENTS will welcome the
working adjustment which
has been reached by the former
members of Interfraternity coun-
cil in the new Council of Presi-
dents of Social Fraternities.

Unable to act as an effective
unit in fraternity affairs last
year, the council was pronounced
defunct from natural causes by

night at its ﬁrst meeting of the

This might be an excerpt from one

the creatures known as Landing

of central Alumni hall. These inter-
esting animals have many peculiar
habits that set them apart from homo
sapiens, which they closely resemble.
In fact they have probably degener-
ated from the former, or perhaps just
sprung from the former.

They are characterized by the
tendency to sun themselves under the
mazdas in this one locality, staying in
one place for an average of an hour
at a time. Dui'ing these siestas they
carry on conversations with small
groups of their brethren, the topics
running from torrid dates to sports,
with an occasional mention of studies.

Another habit is the shouting of
names from one group to another as
a member is recognized, a form of
greeting, These names make interest-

an informal and humane thing
like conversation between men

something like a narrow stairway
landing in Alumni hall. An ini-
portant part of coeducation
hasn’t had a chance.

Ostensibly minor difficulties
like space and heating should not
prevent the Executive committee
from pushing the lounge plan.

The suggestion to re-institute
freshman customs for men has
been delivered to a committee
which will report next month,
and the committee might well
take more than a month to shape
its recommendation.

While there can be no question
of returning to a system of trick

Unconditioned Ten - Year - Old Asks Nothing, Enjoys
Paintings When Artists Succeed—1l/Iaurer

 

By Herrymon Maurer

Last Saturday a friend of mine took her ten—year-old sister Mary
to see the Carnegie International.
is not only interesting but enlightening. Mary did not hesitate to
walk past paintings which were photographic or pretty, or past those
before which art critics were grouped, to stand in front of others
which were striking or warmly human.
paintings; sometimes she looked and said nothing when she saw

The report of Mary ’s reactions

She laughed at the satiric

surprising, she displayed no symptoms
of boredom and was somewhat irked
when she was told it was time to go
to town to select a new hat. Big
sister summed up the matter, “Mary
certainly has taste.”

The young lady, aged ten, certainly
did have taste. She appreciated cer-
tain paintings because she entered
the exhibit without any preconceived
prejudices or ideas as to what a paint-
ing should be. She did not like pho-
tographic works simply because she
did not associate p-ainting and photo-
graphy, She did not analyze tech-
nique. She assumed the artist to be
a competent person and put herself
completely in his hands, ready to en-
joy or to pass by,

Unfortunately, most of us cannot
approach a painting with such a lack
of reserve. VVe may want to read

into the artist’s presentation some-
thing that isn’t there, or we may de-
mand photographic likeness as did
the lady who said, “How lifelike the
edge of the table is; what ﬁne art!”
when she saw a portrait by Boutet

do Monvel in Gallery P.

I shall have to plead guilty, too, to
the crime of endowing a painting I
like with qualities I think it ought to
have, In last Friday’s Pitt News, I
set down not only what “South of
Scranton” suggested to me, but also
a few qualities that I read into it.
Peter Blume’s paintiiig has not the
forceful strength with which I en-
dowed it; neither is it as free from
the effects of a modern school of
painting as, judging from a slight
knowledge of his earlier work, I had
hoped it would be.

“South of Scranton” is, rather, a
typical surrealistic effort in that it
does not present emotions which per-
meate the whole being, but does pre-
sent unconscious feelings which have
just managed to intrude themselves
into the conscious. VVe certainly get
from Blume’s painting a feeling of
desertedness, of forboding; there is
present social analysis, too; but there
is no impelling force.

Your own preconceived notions may
lead you as far astray as did mine.
So I suggest, leave those notions at
home. You’ll get a good deal more
kick out of the International if you
do. I enjoyed the paintings very
much- more after I had sobered up
from my ﬁrst ideological intoxication.
Put yourself in the artist’s hands and
see what he says to you. live don’t
want to be professional art critics; we
want to enjoy paintings.

There are many to enjoy. In later
issues of the Pitt News I shall com-
ment in detail. But now for a brief
mention of a number of paintings

whose artists said nothing to me, I
was struck by John Grabacli’s “The
Fifth Year” in. gallery L on the top
ﬂoor. Partially successful is Grabacli,
though part of the reaction depends
on the title.

In the French section, Marcel
Gromaire has freed himself of any
"art-for-art's-sake."ism and has paint-
ed agricultural works with solidity
and strength. Powerful vertical lines,
straining curves give the essence of
the activity of “Workers of the Soil.”
The colors are warm and earthy_

Karl Sterrer has brought together
into his painting “Life” all the hope-
‘ossness, sadness, and disillusionment
of post-war Europe. You will notice
that his ﬁgures do not stand out do-
cidedly from their background. This
close association of background and
ﬁgures is a necessity as much for
those. who see the painting as for him
who painted it. Vvere these Michel-
a.ngelesque ﬁgures any more force-
fully dynamic, no one could look at
the painting longer than ten seconds
at a time, Here is the power of sin-
cerely felt emotion almost completely
unleashed. VVhether you like or dis-
like pessimism, you will like the force
and sincerity of this painting.

If you enjoy, as I do, satirical
studies of our times, you will appre-
ciate the thrusts of John Stuert
Curry in “State Fair,” of George Bid-
dle in “Folly Beach,” of David Sil-
vette in “Gertrude McGovern.” P. R.
VV. Novinson and Reginald Marsh,
while neither as harsh nor as coii-
vincing, are far from impotence.

There are warm human paintings,
too. One by Thomas Benton, “Lord
Save the Child,” is sympathetic and
analytic, John Sloan has a painting
of a bull-session, “New Homestead.”
that radiates friendliness and cheer.
And Grant ‘Wood presents “Dinner
for.Thresliers.” A more unhappy note
is struck in the analytic paiiitiiigs of
Ray S_ Simboli and the Belgian artist,
Pierre Paulus.

All types of paintings you will ﬁnd
whose reference is not to people: ex-
pressive, dramatic o n e s like
Vlamincl<’s “Environs of Dreux,” sad
disillusioned ones like Burchﬁeld’s
“Old Houses in Vvinter,” and just
landscapes, and just still-lifes.

There are the usual number of ﬂat-
tering portraits of the inhabitants of
Horseback Hall; too few sincere ones
of the inhabitants of Heartbreak
House. But. more in later issues of
the Pitt News about these paintings
and others.

Remember, take a lesson from ten-
Year-old Mary; if you want to get a
kick from the International, leave
your art prejudices at home.

Is_iEPIC’ Pink Scare Unique?

Banks Answers ‘Question For Himself, Then Discusses

 

Geniuses, Cathedral

By Edwin Banks

The most interesting fact about Socialist—Democrat or Democrat-
Socialist Upton Sinclair’s gubernatorial campaign in California is
not so much what he promises to do if elected, or even the possibility
of his election; it is rather the fright he has stirred in the stuffed-
sliirt bosoms of conservative publishers all over the country.

Papers in the East, for example, contain so many editorials

warning the people against this “dangerous radical” that one would
suppose the good citizens of Massaé

chusetts, Pennsylvania, and the other
states were going to vote in California
this fall.

This spectacle of a “pink” m€I1'<1C€
in the land of governmentsanctioned
lynchings, Tom Mooney, and Red-
baiting is an unusual phenomenon,
isn’t it?

South of Scranton .

The concensus by art-love-rs about
the Carnegie Internatio1ial’s latest
ﬁrst prize seems to be that Mr.
Blume’s painting is so delightfully in-
comprehensible.

For the Dead

An Englishman living in Strait Set-
tlements stopped one day at a Chinese
burial ground where food was being
placed over the grave of a native re-
cently interred.

With a poorly suppressed smile, the
Britisher approached a profoundly
placid Chinese standing by and asked:
“Why on earth do you people set out
food for the dead? You jolly well
know they can’t eat it.” The Chinese
said nothing.

A few weeks later the Eng1ishman’s
wife died. In sorrowing respect, he
decked her grave with ﬂowers. The
Chinese happened along, He looked
into the red eyes of the widower.

For Art's Sake

Out on an Iowa farm where my
father was raised, the family had an
old collie who had a passion for dig-
ging out and killing skunks, The dog
never attempted to eat his prey, and
he was inevitably saturated, after
each encounter, with a secretion that
isolated him from the rest of the farm
for at least a week.

But he kept on hunting for skunks.

Penn State Meet

Pitt Team Out For First Victory
Over Lion Squad In Annual
Gross - Country Meet

 

 

At 11 o'clock this morning the var-
sity cross-country team will leave for
State College, Pennsylvania, where
they will face Penn State's undefeated
runners in a dual meet tomorrow aft-
ernoon. The harriers will race over
the ﬁve and one-tenth mile course lo-
cated in the vicinity of the Saucon
Valley country club.

Penn State in its last meet defeat-
ed Lehigh scoring a 15-40 victory, with
State runners capturing the ﬁrst ﬁve
places. Captain Harvey, veteran of
three seasons, led the ﬁeld, covering
the long grind in the fast time of
28:11, He was followed by Book, Det-
weiler, Downey, and Alexander, all of
State.

Making the trip with Coaches Ol-
son and Potts will be Wagenhouser,
Kirkpatrick, Albright, Musico, Tost,

Howe, and either Leggin, Loncher,
Connelly, or Walmsley. Manager
William Dornenburg will be in charge
of the trip.

Pitt will be seeking its first triumph
over the State runners, Last year the
Centre county collegians scored an
18-37 victory over the Panthers.

The freshman team, inactive since

a tie with Langley high school last-

week,will run against the latter team
again in a dual meet next Tuesday
afternoon at Schenley Park. A meet
with the Carnegie Tech freshmen on
November 15 has been added to the
freshman schedule.

burg tomorrow to meet the’ Kiski var-
sity Both the Panther and Kiski
squads came out of hard games last
week with very few casualties and
each expects to have its full strength
available at game time.

According to early season records
the Pitt frosh loom as the favorites.
Kiski has already lost twice to two
district freshman teams, losing to the
Duke freshmen at the ﬁrst of the sea-
son, 14-0, and the Tech p-lebes later
on, 18-0. In the only game played
thus far, the Panther yearlings de-
feated the Carnegie Tech frosh, 12-0.

For the Panther team the lineup
will remain the same as la.st week,
with the possible exception that
Ma.tisi may not be at left tackle.

shoulder ligament which is responding
slowly to treatment,

Panther Swimming Team
Opens Season November 19

 

John Taylor, president of the Alle-
gheny Mountain association, has of-
ﬁ'cially set November 16 as the date

an association title,

The meet will be held in the Pitts-
burgh Athletic association pool, in the
evening, under auspices of the AAU.

 

How To Go

The automobile route to the
VVestminster game, as furnished
by the American Automobile as-
sociation, follows the Ohio River

crosses the river and follows the
river road to Rochester where it
meets route 19. At Portersville,
the road meets route 422 and fol-
lows it to New Castle. The game
is to be played on the New Castle
high school ﬁeld.

According to VVilliam E. Brink-
er, Pitt followers going to the
game may buy tickets at the
Stadium ticket ofﬁce for $1.10.
