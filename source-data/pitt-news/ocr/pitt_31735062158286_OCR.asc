Theft Reports A

Show Increase

By JOANNE DOLINAR

The reported number of
items stolen from the coat

aracks outside the cafeteria

has increased steadily during
the past few weeks. The
thefts, including coats, hats,

books and slide rules, have thus
far amounted to over $1,000.

Although the loss of raincoats
earlier in the year was high,'the
recent losses that have been re-
ported have been of coats and
hats of better—than-average qual-
ity. “The person who is doing it
certainly has good taste,” com-

mented Dr. William Swartzbaugh. .

Officials have some suspicion that

the work is being done by stu-

dents, rather than outsiders.

Several plans have been con-
sidered to counteract the steal-
ing, but only a temporary one
has been decided upon deﬁnite-
ly. Within a week a table coun-
ter will be set up in the foyer
to serve as a check room. Stu-
dent employees will man ‘the
checkroom. Coat racks will be
available for those students who
do not. wish to check their coats.
Student marshalls will also be

' put on duty. »

More permanent plans -are’ now
under consideration which will be
better able to accommodate stu-
dent belongings.

A proposal to partition’ - the
foyer next to the ballroom com-
pletely to the ceilingandpuse this
area as a checkroom has been re-
jected._ Oﬁicials have also put
thumbs down on a plan to install
lockers in the Union because they
feel that this would not meet the
needs.

Activities Card

Elimination Set

The Office of the Dean of
Students has announced that
the Student Activities Card
will be discontinued as a

‘means of University identi-

ﬁcation, beginning the spring
semester,,1959. In the past no
single means of identification was
agreed on by the various Univer-
sity offices.

The Activities card was also
misused. Students have not rea-
lized that the card is not a ticket
of admission for which the stu-
dent has paid, _but an additional
means of identiﬁcation. The elimi-
nation of the card will reduce the
cost.and speed up the processing
atregistration. ..

Theldentiﬁcation card will now
include the identiﬁcation purpose
of the Activities Card.

The._ID Card will be necessary

The ID Card will_be neces-
sary for admission to athletic
contests, check cashing service,
certain ﬁnal examinations, use
of the University library, stu-
dent elections, and use of Stu-
dent Union facilities.

Two objectives of‘ this change
are to simplify and have uniform-
ity regarding student identiﬁca-
tion, and to "encourage students
to act in accordance with Univer-

Pre-counseled freshmen and
sophomores in the School of
Liberal Arts will be registered
separately from the other Uni-
versity graduates. They will not
be-required to report to the Syria

Instead, they will report to 242
C1 at their regu1ar.appoi_ntment
time. This time is listed accord-

ing to alphabetical order in the .

registration kits. Students will
register in alphabetical groups at
ten minute’ intervals.

Registrar E. Batchelder and
Richard Hodges of the Arts Ad-
visory Board caution students
against reporting for registration

they can relieve ‘the problem of a

9 The new calendar which will

become effective in September
and which will be adopted by
most ofthe University’s schools
is as follows: Fall Trimester,
Sept. 8-Dec. 19; ‘Winter Tri-
mester, Jan. 6—April 14; Spring
Trimester, April 19-July 30;
Summer Vacation. July 31-Sept.
5; 1960 Fall Trimester, begins
Sept. 6. '

The plan of three ‘academic
terms of fifteen weeks each fol-
lowed by a month of summer va-
cation will be available to all
freshmen "and sophomore students
next September.

.Schools and Divisions which
will conform to this calendar next
year are School of the Liberal
Arts, Schools of Engineering and
Mines, School of Pharmacy (first
two years); School of General
Studies,- School of Business Ad-
ministration, School of Education.

School of .\Nursing, Graduate
‘School of Public and International
Affairs, Graduate School of Social
Work, Johnstown College, Divi-
sion of the Humanities, Division
of the Natural Sciences, Division
of the Social Sciences.

However, during 1959-1960
the third period of study or
spring trimester will be avail-
able only to freshmen and
sophomore students in these
schools and divisions. Other
students will complete their
two semesters of study on April
14.

The summer session of school
year 1959-60 will be available in
its present form to those juniors
who wish to avail themselves of
it. Beginning with 1961, however,

- summer session programs will be

cut to serve only the needs of
special groups such as public
school and college teachers.

This situation will exist only
during the ﬁrst year of operation
on the trimester calendar. In
1960-61 the trimester plan will be

available to all undergraduate
students. _ .
Some of the University’s

schools will not adopt the tri-
mester calendar next’ Septem-
ber, but will continue with their
traditional calendars. These in-
clude the School of Law, School

Pi Tau Sigmas
Convene Here

After applying for three suc-
cessive years in advance, the
Pittsburgh Tau Chapter of Pi Tau
Sigma, National Honorary Mech-
anical Engineering Fraternity,
succeeded in being selected as

host for the 1959 national conven-
tion of Pi Tau Sigma.

This convention is to be a part
of the City’s Bicentennial celebra-
tion. The convention will be held
Oct. 26-27 with approximately 100
delegates attending.

Selection of the University as
host was achieved after an all out
effort by this year’s Pitt delega-
tion to the national convention.

The committee, made up of Ron
Black, Carl Simsic, Basil Var-
doulis, and Dick Chamberlain,
gave the delegates pamphlets,
brochures, and buttons about the
University and. the city along
with a letter from Mayor Lawr-
ence inviting the convention to
Pittsburgh in 1959. The 1958 con-
vention responded by unanimous-

vention at Pitt. _
The Pi Tau Sigma faculty lad‘-
'v~iser, Mr. William E. Conturo,
-commented, “This convention as
part of the city's ' bicentennial
celebration, is the most important

.2:1d_bieee§t thi.ns.--that.._‘Pi Tau

Sigma has ever done.

“The student organizing, ' plan-
ning, and conducting this conven-
‘tion will attain a wealth of ex-
perience and enjoyment that will
be a very valuable asset in pre-
paring themselves for their com-
munity and professional life after

Vgraduati0n.”'

We are gratiﬁed to hear the suggestion ofiAlan Papernick, Inter-

71 itiation be upped to a 1.3 QPA. , —

The Pitt News, utilizing this as as basis, would ‘like,’ to propose
the following program to Interfraternity Council.
Besides the__ 1.3 \initiation,.we propose 1.0 each semesterand 1.0

 overall average for fraternity men to retain active status. Any ac-

‘,tive falling. below either of the latter requirements would be con-
continued activity in the fra-

This program, differing for present. fraternity ' actives and
pledges, would go into effect. next -fall. Present freshmen and pledges
would be required to maintain the 1.0 each semester and 1.0 overall
even though they had not entered the fraternity while this rule’ was

‘ in effect. _ o '

_ Present sophomores and juniors would only berequired to main-
tain a 1.0 each semester to retain active status.

In addition, we propose a system of academic probation for in-

7 dividual fraternities. "A minimum average_"should be set semester

by semester depending upon the all-men’s and a1l—fraternity aver-

' ages below which any fraternity would .lose all social privileges.
The fact that such a fraternity would have many scholastically in-~

eligible\ brothers would make the closing ofathe doors a mere formal-
ity in many cases. ’ ’

A maximum drop in a fraternity average from one semester

to the next should be set. Any‘ fraternity suffering such ‘a drop

automatically would be placed on social probation.

Both of these academic disciplinary -functions on a. fraternity
as a whole should be carried out by the Scholarship Committee of
Interfratern-ity "Council. ' A .

These drastic measures are" necessitated by many of the ‘tragic
facts of fraternity academic life at the University. I

In 1955-56, the all—pledge average was 1.318. In 1956-57, it
plummeted disastrously to 1.044. Although the ﬁgure for 1957-58 is

A -enot available, by the drop in the all-fraternity average, it may be
surmised that the all-pledge average was even lower.

certainly cannot be allo_wed to continue.
The all-fraternity average _(actives and pledges) was 1.498 in
'55-’56i, 1.364 in ’56-’57, and 1.338 in ’57—’58. The 1955-56 school year
all-fraternity average was very slightly below the all-men’s under-
graduate average. A ‘  y
' In both 1956-57 and 1957-58,.the all-fraternity average dropped
more than the all-men’s average}: ’56-’57, 1.442 all-men’s, 1.362 all
fraternity; and ’57-’58,. 1.427 all-me_n’s, 1.338 "all—fraternity. __ '
One ofthe big selling points of fraternities on many campuses
- is the very high average they maintain, and the encouragement they
give‘to ‘brothers and pledges to do their share. This seems at present

‘A ~.-B thing of the past at this University. 

It behooves fraternities, to choose their members from among
better than mediocre students.wThe shocking pledge. average statistics
indicate that a predominance of completely unacademically geared
men are pledging fraternities. ; -

If allowed to continue, this might signal the end of the fraternity

Ups Student Motivation

Editor, ‘The’ Pitt -News:

In your editorial of Dec. 10,
you said that “Students value
more those things for which they

-A pay. Without tuition, a college
education would be merely an
extension of public high school
in that students would feel little
responsibility to excell.”

, This statement is not only an
‘implicit insult —to students get-
ting their education under the
“GI Bill of Rights” — who, in-
cidentally, have tended to be
above average in» motivation and
effort —- but also shows a serious.
lack of insi-ght into the nature
of human motivation.

It is probably true that stu-
dents, like others, .value more

getting established in\ the busi-
ness or profession. ,_

Unless the rate of interest is
merely nominal,

sult in a doubling of the original
cost of the education.

Student Reports Theft

From Union Coat Racks
Editor, The Pitt News:

Yesterday my hat was taken
from the coat racks in front of
the Student Union cafeteria.
When I reported this to the Uni-
versityKPolice,i I found I wasn’t
alone. Another two coats were
also taken yesterday. ,

More than $1000 worth of
clothes, books, briefcases and
slide rules is taken from there
in the course of a year. Granted,
some of "this is accidental, but
there are some Pitt students who
are morallyimmature and who
would steal from their fellow
students. Something must be.
done to stop this.

A coat room should be set up‘
there, similar to the one in the
ground floor of the. cathedral.

those things which are “hard to
get.” But a college education can

..be'kept “hard to get” in other

ways than a high money ‘cost:

In Russia a collegefeducation
is also hard to get: I am told that
in spite of their large enrollment
in institutions of higheryglearning,
less than one-fourth of those

—applying are actually admitted.
, For‘ “rationing” their enrollment,

however, they use a high stand-
ard of scholastic aptitude and at-
tainmentrather than a high tui-
tionfee. I ‘

It is perhaps worth noting that
one of the reasons why so many
colleges here have difficulty in
raising their ‘standards of scho-
lastic aptitude and attainmentjs
precisely because so many of our
more able students are “priced
out of.the market.”

The fact that a student’s tui-
tion ispaid by a scholarship pro-
bably tends, if anything, to in-
crease his motivation rather
than reduce it.

On the other hand, when. a
student’s tuition is paid by his
parents, the cost does not al-
ways«increase the motivation of
the student himself!

One "of the ‘basic arguments,

against the -use of loans as a
primary means of ﬁnancing ed-
ucation is the fact that the bene-

Syracuse Hands Cats

F0urtl1‘Defeat in Row;
Hennon Scores 31

By LARRY HAGGERTY

A victory over Mel Crats-
ley’s Carnegie Tech Tartans-
at the Field House tomorrow
night will give the Panther
hoopsters undisputed posses-
sion of the mythical basket-

ball championship of the City of
Pittsburgh. _

As a result of downing the Du-
quesne Dukes in the Steel Bowl
last month, all Coach Bob Tim-
mons’ boys need to do to annex
this honor is to show up at the
Field House tomorrow night for
the 8:30 tipoff and the game will
be theirs because the Tartans‘ are
ﬁgured to be a breather on the,
Skyscraper U. schedule this sea-
son.‘

"Timmons refuses to believe in
breathers, though. “When the
football team went out to play
Nebraska, the game was listed as
a sure victory for us, but look
what happened," Timmons said.

' Soﬁa Injured

The Jungle Cats captured last
season’s games with relative ease,
86-68 and 73-54. Tartan fans
‘pointed out, however, that the
Skibos were without the services
of star player Bill Soﬁa when
‘they ‘lost to the Panthers, 73-54,
at the __F_‘_ie_lgl House. _ ‘

Soffa, a 5-9 sophomore from

Duquesne, Pa., was the Plaid‘s
top scorer last year, but it is’
doubtful that he will be in the
best physical shape for tomor-
row's encounter. He has been
bothered by a sprained back for
the last two or three weeks.

In the ﬁrst meeting between the
neighborhood schools in the Skibo
Gym last season, Soffa and-
Panther All-American Don Hen-
non put on one of the hottest
scoring duels in local hoop his-
tory. The Jungle Cats' star just
edged Soffa, 34 points to 33.

Joining Soffa in the starting
lineup will be Stan Skalka, A-.ndy
Komer, Bill Hauser, and Francis
Miller. The Tartan’s sixth man
will be Tom Mueller. Tech will
take a 4-5 record into the game as

they have lost to tough teams like 4

Duquesne and Westminster.

Forglst Win of Season

_ By JACK

SMITH

In the next two nights the Panther Cubs will entertain

Duquesne and Carnegie Tech,

respectively. Both games —are

scheduled for the Field House. Tonight’s game with Duquesne

will be the ﬁrst encounter for

Coach Carl Peterson’s forces

with a freshman team. Allprevious games were with ‘JV_

teams. ~ *

Thus far Duquesne has a record
of 2-3, as compared to the Cubs’
0-4 slate. Duke wins have come

St. Francis J V’s.

Leading scorer for Duquesne has
been 6-2 Bill Strorn. Strom pos-
sesses a ﬁne two-hand shot and
has averaged close to 16 points a_
game. Paul Benec, a former Cen-
tral Catholic standout, has been.
the best all-around player for the
Duke frosh.

‘Duke Coach Steve Garay is
trying to groom his boys for
varsity plays and has been us-_
ing plays and patterns very
similar to that of the varsity.

-“The boys have -failen «below» -

expectations,” Publicity Director
Dick Sharbaugh said. “With the
talent we have I feel we should
be doing‘ a lot better.” Sharbaugh ”
pointed to Bob Sarikey and Ralph
Shutterley as outstanding Panther
players. ‘ T 1

lose their fourth game in a row.

Leading the Syracuse ﬁve in
scoring was Forward Tom Mo_s-

for the victors were Jon
Cincebox and Pete Chudy with .
16 and 15 points, respectively.
