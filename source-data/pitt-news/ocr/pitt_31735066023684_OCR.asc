Andrew Young Speaks

G Vietnam Strained US Policy «

By WALTER R. WATSON

Pitt News Staff Writer

The Vietnam war, during 1973
and 1974, was recognized by the
American people as “a -strain on
our relationships in Europe, many
of the nations of Asia and the Third
,World,” according to, former UN
ambassador Andrew. Young.

Young spoke on Tuesday before

‘a crowd of 400 at Soldiers and

Sailors Hall.

“We were concerned about
human rights in part, b_ecause our
nation had been involvedand iden-
tiﬁed withj some of ‘the more
notorioous dictatorships in thes
hemisphere and abroad,“ he said.
“We found that people were con-

cerned about what was happening
to minorities: whether it be the

minorities of Jews in the Soviet"

Union, or if those of an inferior
status, whowere in fact, in the ma-
jority in South Africa.”

To enthusiastic applause, Young
announced that, “the U.S. has yet

to admit thatithe North Vietnamese
won that war.”

Young referred to Republican
presidential can_didate, Ronald
Reagan, pointing out that it-,was' a
judge appointed by the then
California Governor Reagan who
sent the Bakke case to the Supreme
court, along with justices appointed
by the the Nixon Administration

' during the late ’60’s and early ’70’s.‘

tion,” he proclaimed to a fervent

round of ovation.‘ ' 

Young touched on the -tedious
position Iran is presently in. He
said that the Iranian milfary, in ‘lieu

of long-term conflict with Iraq,

would fac e the possibility of Russia
using military intervention means to
furthervthe Soviet strategic position
in the Persian Gulf. Young saw in
that ‘’a danger, and a threat to U.S.
oil interests.”

“If we are to havea continuing
relationship with the Arab world,
we will have to find a formula to in-
clude the Palestinians in any settle-
ment that will be reached in the
Middle East. The P.L.O. will pro-
bably have to be represented if there
is to be a settlement and if Israel is

The U.s. energy crisis could be.
alleviated by the use of the 100 per-
cent alcohol to fuel automobiles ac-
cording to Barry commoner, the
citizens’ party presidential can-
didate.

“If you want to run a car. on’ solar
energy, pour 100 percent alchol in
the gas tank, made of pure
vegetable matter. _

r This is our most effective alter-
native and the best combustion
methods available to us,” Com-
moner said to the 200 plus audience
at David Lawrence Hall on Tues-
day. Automobiles would have to be
specially ‘designed to operate on
alcohol. '

Commoner cited Brazil as a

verted ‘ to alcohol-burning
automobiles withinfour years. Ac-
cording to Commoner these
vehicles will be sold at prices com-
parable to gas burning automobiles.

Comoner, touted by his party as
a “well-known scientist,” is the
author of a book entitled the
“Politics of Energy.”

Commoner contended that solar
energy is our best alternative to the
energy crisis. “The energy we use
cannibalizes the very economy it in-
tends to support,” he said.“Go to
renewable solar energy, we’ll never
run out of sunshine,” he added.

The citizens Party was founded
last April. This November will mark
its first participation in an election.
“Tonight "we are on 30 ballots,
hopefully we’ll be on a few more by
November.” ‘

Iron-Iraq Conflict any

‘Accidental

By SCOT STONE‘
Pitt News Staff Writer
_The current state of the conflict
between Iran and Iraq, is an “ac-
cidental war,” according to a noted,
Pitt authority on Mideast politics.
“Both sides are suspicious of the

U.S., and -I think~Carter- is aware of .

this,” said Dr. Richard Cottam, a

Pitt political ‘ science professor.

“But I think we must take notice of
this fact even more explicitly, and
through our action show: that ‘we
mean it, that we’re not going to side

with either power.”

Cottam also explained the soviet
Union’s position in the Iranlraqi
conflict: ~ A‘ ‘

“The Soviet policy so far is very
clear,” Cottam said. “Their
tendency is to play it very cool, see-
ing it as well as we do, that it is an
accidental situation. ”

In May, 1980, the University

There~is a catch, however, which

was brought up in a discussion of *-

doesn’t believe in bargaining and
there is the chance of his being
discredited. If they do it, they’ll do

see the resluts of it.”

An‘ external factor that may play

Cottam said, “and his statements
in the campaign about Iranian

desire to free the hostages and help‘

will be very effective in this,” he
said. “I think that more likely Iraq
will be moved by pressure from
fellow Arab states. It's not going to
be easv to stop them.”

While hewould offer no definite
prediction as to which sidewould
_win he did cite the military
superiority of the Iraqis.

“There’s no question that the
Iraqi’s are superior, “Cottam said.

humiliated Iraq in 1975, by ratifying
a territorial treaty. Iraq has

At Women's Health Services you receive

misconceptions like these that have
led to a great misunderstanding
about the deaf,” she said. This
misunderstanding of the deaf has
created what Walkney refers to as a

_ One way in which.she has been
able to help fellow deaf students is
to teach classes on sign language

this project, there were no sign
language classes offered to students.

help ‘of Zona Popppenhagen, pro-

University. To Host Symposium On Future Of Puerto «Rico I

By JANE HOLAHAN
' Pitt News Staff Writer

A symposium dealing with possi-

ble statehood, economy and culture
of Puerto Rico will be held the week
of September 29 on the Pitt cam-

pus.
“Puerto Rico At . The
Crossroads: Independence,

Statehood, or Commonwealth?” is -

being sponsored by the Center for
Latin American Studies and was
organized ‘by department chairman
Carmelo Mesa Lajo, Spanish
department chairman Dr. Kieth
McDufﬁe, and Beatriz Rosado, a
graduate student in the Spanish
department. '

“I found a lot of people don’_t

know a lot of things about Puerto‘

" Rico,“ Rosado said, who is Puerto

Rican. “There .is a_ lack of
knowledge about our culture. A lot
of students asked if we had roads,

cars and elevators. ‘ A lot didn’t
know we’d been part of the country
since 1898.”

A _ Puerto Rico became part of the
United States through the treaty of
Paris which was signed‘ to end the

Spanish-American war.

In 1900, after two, years of
military rule, a civil government
was ‘established and in 1917,
through the law known as the

‘Foraker Act, American citizenship,

was given to Puerto Ricans. ,

I Through the years, laws giving
Puerto" Rico a more autonomous
form of government were passed,
but its status was never fully
established. ‘

‘There ’was a primary this past ‘
year in Puerto Rico-for the first »

time, but Puerto Ricans are not
allowed to vote for president in the

general election this November.

v Puerto Ricans have no represen-

tatives in Congress, although the
United States is able to intercede in
internal affairs when circumstances

” warrant.

Thereis a ‘resident comissioner in
Washington D.C. who can make
suggestionsto the Congress, but he
has no legal power. Ultimately it
will be up to Congress to decide
whether or not Puerto Rico
becomesa state. ,

The Supreme Court determined
that while Puerto Rico belongs to
the United States it does not form a
part of the United States.

Elections being held in November
will help bring a solution tothe
question of Puerto Rico’s. status.
There are four major parties in
Puerto Rico running in this elec-
tion. ‘ .

The New Progressive Party has

' Dr.

been in’ power since 1976. It would
like-to see Puerto Rico become the
51st American state. The Popular
Democratic Party, which was the
party in power through most of the
last 50 years, wants Puerto Rico to
maintain its current status. The
Puerto Rican Independence Party
wants Puerto Rico to become an in-_
dependent country and the Puerto
Rican Socialist Party wants Puerto
Rico to" become a Democratic
Socialist country. ‘ A ‘

‘A debate between representatives
of these four parties will be held on
Wednesday, Octover I at 2 p.m. in
the Kurtzman Room of the Student
Union.

Another event of the symposium
will be a discussion of the cultural
development of Puerto Rico with
Arturo Morales Carrion,
former president-of the University

of Puerto Rico and Director of The

Puerto Rican Humanities Founda-

tion, which will be held on Monday,
September 29, at 2 p.m. in"Room
205 of David Lawrence Hall.
Films on Puerto Rico will be
shown Thursday, October 2 at 8:15

p.m. in Room IP56 of Forbes

Quadrangle. On Friday, October 3
at noon in, Room 106 of David
Lawrence Hall there will be a
discussion of Puerto Rico’s
economy. -
There will be no charge for any of
‘the events during the symposium.
According to Rdsado this will be
the first event of its kind at Pitt.
“The University is offering an
opportunitjn to be in contact with
our culture and history,” she said.

ding_ to Alex Stewart, program director.‘

Stewart recently cited four reasons for -- the
popularity of UHP courses: _ ’ 9

—UHP courses were found to be “more’T or
“much more” challenging than non-UHPcourses by

.83 percent of the students enrolled during the

1979-1980 school term. — _
—-Of the students polled, 82 percent said that UHP

courses required “more” or ‘_‘much more” effort ‘

than non-UHP courses. - -

—The students polled also said that they found
UHP faculty conscientious, fair and organized. .
~ —And finally, 93 percent of the students said that
they would take more UHP courses in the future.

' The Pitt News is, at the very least-, excited about
the prospect of 560 uhdergraduates finding curricular
fulfillment here at the university. But «what about the
other 11,500 undergraduates not enrolled in honors
courses. . ' ' . _

Honors courses are open to any student Wlth 81 3 -25
grade point average but any undergraduate can enter
honors course by securing a special permission slip.
This allowance of dispels any rumors that the Univer-
sity Honors Program is an elitist program which
closes its doors in the faces of eager students on the

basis of their grade-point average falling short of the

designated mark.
But there is another problem.’ And that problem
lies in the fact that an, overwhelming majority of
honors course enrollees found the special coursework
to be so much more fulfilling than the non-honors
coursework. _ e
What is wrong with thosenon-UHP courses, and
why have they come up short, failing to stimulate and
enrich the students’ unversity learning experience?

And are UHP students ‘saying that honors intruc-

tors are conscientious, organized, and fair, as op-
posed to many of the same instructors" performances
before their non-‘honors course?

-And finally, why must there be any distinction bet-
ween university classes that stimulate and are taught
by conscietious instructors and those that fall short
of stimulation and are taught by lesser instructors?

Shouldn’t it be the job of a “quality” institution
such as Pitt to assure that all of its students receive
top-notch instruction from dedicated, competent in-
structors?

We are living in a country plagued by mediocrity.

 

Q:

It is a ‘nation where only 55 percent of all adults know 1;.-

how many Senators represent them in Washington
and a nation where only 23 percent of those same
Americans know what the Bill of Rights is—the
document that gives them their . most basis
democratic rights. , '
We attend a university whrer some soon-to-be
graudated .students are unable to put five words
together to make grammatically correct sentence,
much less know or care ‘that the Iranians bombed
Baghdad yesterday. ' i ' I

We should not be forced to tolerate mediocrity in
our educational system—we should demand the best,
the most rigorous and the most stimulating courses at
all times, in all departments of our universities, and

for all students.

And there should be no designation of honors cur-
riculum vs. not-as fulfilling courses of study.

The honors program is a much needed innovation
and addition to Pitt’s curriculum. It’s just unfor-
tunate that this year, only 560 students will be given

’ the chance to experience the best that Pitt has to of-

Io The Editor:
. Let’s discuss a little exercise we

' all went through a week or so back.

Registration. Remember that?

4 Funny how the human mind blocks

out bad experiences. Consequently,
registration seems to be speeding to

. a blur of shapeless frustration.

Let me put it this way: I almost
left this school before ever entering

because registration was so horri-
ble. Perhaps my loss would not be

so great but if the registration pro-
cess is so bad as to make people ac-
tually consider leaving, you are go-
to lose people through
discouragement. Everyone you

_ "meet at registration is in a state of

rage. It’s gross. I’ve seen nothing
like it before at any other college."

.Anyway, you get the idea that

N ’ ‘- there is a problem. I would like to

_recommend some changes in the

‘endearing system of how we register
 people. These don’t have to be ac-
“ » cepted in total, even one or two

l. A very fundamental problem
is lack of information. There was
no one or nothing there to easily in-
form you on the steps to take and
what you needed to take them. Put
signs up. Hand out leaflets. Hire
barkers. It took me a long time to
get a hold of a course schedule and
CAS course description.

2. Make the process systematic.
It’s" disjointed. You go there, you
go here. Where next? Make it the
old livestock routine. Enter here,
leave there. Be sure everyone does
all the steps. ' '

3. Instead of having to wait
hours to get to the one counter
where all the cards are handed out,
let’s change it. On a departmental
basis let everyone have their own lit-
tle table in a big room. The student
enters the room, then proceeds over

to the department table to get their

needed class -cards. Each depart-

dated. ‘ ‘

4. After collecting your class
cards, it would be simple to hand
them to someone who would figure
up your bill.. Right there. So much

- for this, so much for that. Then go

over to the cashier, turn in your
cards and pay. The school gets its
money fastand you get a paid-fee
receipt. Adjustments through
add/ drops can be settled up later by
the accountants. _

5. With your pair~fee receipt in
hand, go to a person who" would
take your picture and return to you
an I.D. card. -. This would be very
nice and is very possible. You don’t
have to wait a month._

tal basis. To drop a math class, go

7. If there is a new system or not,
what you need is more people. Hire
people. It is really unfair to let the
ten people or so in G-17 and the few

thousand or so people waiting to get ’

another. Hiring temporary people
or using work—study students for
registration would be an in-
expensive great help.

Commoner said, our goal is to
get 5 percent of the vote, to
mobilize us until we become a ma-
jority party.” .
Commoner addressed other
topics of national concern during
his fifty-minute speech, including

inflation, nuclear war, and the

hostage crisis. He also made several
attacks on the oil companies along
‘with, United States Steel. "

“The U.S. oil companies made us
dependent on the Mideast because
it was profitable for them. In the
mid l950’s they realized they could
make twice the profit on imported
oil so they began importing and
stopped looking for domestic oil,’’
Commoner said.

“USS'has been closing one plant-
after another because they have
found that it is cheaper to‘ manufac-
ture chemicals thansteel.” “They
are interested in profits rather than
sustaining incomes and properties
of workers. We in the citizens’ par-

On nuclear war: “Nuclear war is
Jonestown on a global scale. It is
planned suicide for both sides. We
can’t tolerate the notion that we can
defend the world with nuclear war.
It won't work. We need a policy to
disarm us and the Russians.”

Commoner cited the effects a
nuclear bomb would have on the
metropolitan Pittsburgh area.

“One 20 megaton hydrogen
bomb dropped on the city of Pitt-
sburgh would instantly kill 1.3
million of the 1.7 million people
and casualties resulting in death
would bring the total to 1.6 million

deaths. You can’t defend a country

that doesn't survive.” ‘

On increased military spending: 

“Why put tens of thousands of
dollars into a tank that will even-
tually rust? Put that money into the
economy and people will have jobs.

- “You can’t cut inflation and in-

crease military spending at the same_

time. "

On‘ the ‘Iraq-Iranian 'conflict:
“‘We are tragically seeing another
sign of war. The Iraqi wouldn’t be
attacking Iran if Iran weren’t
weakened by the hostage crisis. We
‘made enemies of Iran by appointing
the Shah despot of his own people.

The least we could do is publish the ~

documents that show we know that

another country unjustifiab1y.”

Commoner does not think he will
win this election but he said that is
not his aim anyway. A victory in

Pitt News Sports Editor

Tomorrow's Pitt-Temple contest’

‘ looks to be little more than a scrim-
‘mage for_ the sixth-ranked Pan-
thers. On paper, ‘the Temple Owls
look very- unimpressive. They have
lost their ﬁrst two games of the
season,’ first to Rutgers 21-3 and
' then to ﬁrst time Division I-A
0 member Delaware 28-7.

However, coach Jackie Sherrill is
not taking anything‘ for granted and
is expecting a little more out of the
Owls than their coach, Wayne Har-
din, is giving them credit for.

“Coach Hardin always seems to

’ n have something up his sleeve for

‘us,” said Sherrill. “He does great
jobs against teams he thinks he’s
over matched by.’f I

’ Last year, the Owls came into the 4 .

game withthe same feeling of being
overmatched and gave Pitt a run for
its life before falling 10-9. The win-

‘' , ning score was a 46-yard Mark.
‘ Schubert field goal hit with less
 .- _ than four minutes to go. It was the

second consecutive year that Pitt

_ , had to come from behind to down
. the Owls. '

_ Temple is coming off its best
season in the school’s history, but
the Owls lost 13 of the 22 starters

, ' from that team. They finished the

1979 season with a record of 10-2
and won the Garden State Bowl
over California 28-7 and ended up
ranked ' _17th.

- As for the Panthers, the big ques- A

tion is whether the offense can score
more points this. week. '

“Our offensive players gained an .

awful lot of confidence from that
third quarter (against Kansas),”

Sherrill said. “Our players_ now
know that we can run the ball as

well as throwit.” - '
One problem that the Panthers
will have-tomorrow is the loss of of-

'7 fensive tackle Mark May for the.

game with a sprained knee.
However, according to Sherrill May
will return for next week’s contest
against Maryland._

“Hopefully, we’ll be able to con-

centrate and get some things done
Saturday,” Sherrill said. “We had

a good practice on Monday and a.‘

good one on Tuesday, but we did

.not practice very well Wednesday.
Hopefully, we can pick it up and get
a little more movement and jump-
ing around.” . p S '

Out of Bounds

By Jeff Durosko

Kansas Jayhawks did last‘ week. If they do, perhaps

the most surprised man in the house will be Temple -
coach Wayne Hardin who on Wednesdays said, .

“We’re just not a good football team. We’re not
very good in any phase of the game.” '

Don’t believe it_ for a second fans. Although the
Owls don’t look like a good football team, the Pan-
thers probably aren't going to repeat their 76-0 defeat
of the Owls in 1977. The coach was obviously play-
ing the same psychological game that all coaches play
in building up the opposition andiplaying down their
own team. ’ ‘ ‘ '

At the first game against Boston College, some
fans showed very little class in booing quarterback
Dan Marino on more than one occasion. For a
school whose fans are already laying claim to a na-
tional championship and a trip to New Orleans to
boo its number one quarterback——on ABC television,
no less—shows ignorance.

Even if Pitt doesn’t win tomorrow’s gameA76-0 or -

even 21-0. to escape, with a win in every game this

    

 

season may be enough to win a national champion-
ship. If the Panthers can manage to win every con-
test, they will in fact be lucky, as every team on their

— schedule is gunning for them. The Pitt game is “the
; big one” for most every team on the Panther slate,

and as long as Pitt keeps winning it will continue to
be that way. _

Thus far, the Pitt team has won and has also im-
proved over the past two games. What a lot of peo-

. ple didn’t realize at the Boston Collegegame was that -

Pitt was playing a good team. The Eagles proved
that this past week when they easily defeated na-
tionally ranked Stanford. The Temple game could be
Pitt’s day of reckoning with itself and its fans. Both
the offense and defense are looking to rise to the oc-
casion and prove that they are a national contender.

, The Panther defense is currently ranked second in
the nation against the rush as the Pitt D—me_n held the

‘Kansas offense to just four yards rushing last week.

The Panthers are (fourth in total defense.

According to Panther Sal Sunseri, the defense isn’t
satisfied yet-. Being number _four just doesn’t set well
with the defensive team. V . _

“We have 11 guys who won’t be satisfied until
we_’re number one,” Sunseri said. _

Sounds a lot like what 50,000 Pittfans talking in
unison would say, doesn’t-it? I A ' _-

Pitt News Sports Writer

This weekend the Pitt women’s
'volleyball team squares off against
a host of rivals in a 16 team tourna-
-ment at Temple University.

“We’re looking foward to play-
ing Deleware and Rhode Island
because they’re new to us and they
have decent volleyball teams,” Pan-
therette coach Shelton Collier said,
“but Georgetown and Rutgers are
sftill our major obstacles on the
way to the eastern nationals.”

The Rutgers and Georgetown

tea/ms both have poweer and height-

in thier favor. Each squad» has an

~ average of four to five six foot
players. But height can be a deficit
as well as an advantage.

“Our girls aren”t that strong,

and we try to use that to our advan- »

tage,” Collier said. “We run a type
of offense and defense that is orien-
tated to the type of ' things people
5-8 and 5-9 can do. We have to.try
and work it so they can’t control the
game at the net, then we feel we can
control the match.’.’

As a conseqhence, the Pantheret-
tes have been concentrating on

defense in their practices‘ this week. .

“One of the big steps in getting a
short team to defeat igger
teams,”Collier said, “is not only
hood ball handleing but a strorig
defense.” ‘

“We have these problems that
are starting to creep up,”\Collier
said. “We have a couple of people
who are going to miss some action
because of sore shoulders, and

some ankle and, tendenidous pro- -

blems. ’ ’

In addition to injuries, acadmics
will also take‘ its toll this weekend.

“We’re going ‘to have several
girls miss matches beca. e they’re
going to stay here and go. to
school,’.’ Collier said, “and this is
consistent with our philosophy.”

Panther Boaters Down 'Neighbon'ng Camegie-Mellon

By ANNA ARLOTTA
Pitt News Sports Writer

With a 2-0 victory over the Titans
of Carnegie-Mellon, -the Panther
soccer team showed that they have
nothing but winning on their minds
this season. For the first time in two
years the Panthers have started the
yearoff on a positive note and have
now boosted their record to 33-2.

The win could be creditedto an
entire team effort but the scoring
was placed upon
sophomore wing Eric Tiedtke. The
second year man from Ft. Worth,

‘Texas had his foot on each of the

two goals against the Titans on
Wednesday evening. The first of
these was set up by center forward
Bob Hughes. Hughes passed down
the left wing to Tiedtke who made a

- successful sprint further down the

‘side. He then guided the ball to the
left which nearly crossed the goal
mouth and went in‘ the nets. The
‘goal occurred with only 2:38 on the
clock.

Shortly after that goal Carnegie-
Mellon rebounded quicklyshowing
that they were ready for some tough
soccer with the Panthers. The
Titans-took two consecutive shots

on goal that would have tied-the“

game had it not been for the superb
goaltending of Scott Thunberg. The
junior from Levittbwn left the Pan-
thers last year determined to return
with an improved, secured manner.
That accomplishment has been
shown time and time again this
season. “Scott really kept us in the
contest with those saves early in the

AQQQL

garne,” said s_topper Tom Trempus.
“They were great, I really thought
we were going to have a tie on our
hands.”

The goalkeeping is reminding me
of the days when I first came here
and Frank (Bucci) was in » the

‘nets,”said Hughes. “We haven't
had that tight of goalkeeping for a
“few years now until that season.‘ It
helps the defense so ,much because
you know that someone can take a
long shot and Scott will be there to
save it.” _

Thunberg was there to save six of
the seven shots on goal that the
Titans took against Pitt Wednesday
evening. The other shot went wide
of the goal mouth. ‘

ther defense and the attackers . The
.team is beginning to have real suc-
cess in working together. With the
number of injured playerson the
squad coach‘ Leo Bemis has been
filling spots left vacant.
“Considering the way people
have been hurt we are playing pretty
well” said Danny Hamm. “Of
course we still miss those hurt, like '
A1 (Adelmann)'in the midfield. He
is just such a skilled and
knowledgeable player that he leaves
a big space to fill when he is out.”

“We are starting to move people
around to positions that they are
'unaccustomed to,” said Hamm,
and this causes a lot of lapses on the —
field‘ because people ‘are disoriented
._ to what they should be doing there.
 Once we get everyone back to where

   

s—__; \__n \___.a \___,.._I L,” r

they belong ther should be even.‘
more improvement. Those who are '
filling in are doing a fine «job but it
does take time to get adjusted.”

The second half of play showed

‘another good display of Panther of-

fense in the beginning minutes,
while the Titans were challenging
every minute. There was no scoring
until wing Gerry Wasson took con-
trol of the ball and crossed a long
ball to Tiedtke who took it in for
thesecond of the game. The entire
play was. picture perfect.
Sweeperback Don Bowen was

' back in action after a weeks layoff

from a pulled calf muscle. Bowen
showed little sign of injury as he
put in an excellent game in front of.
Thunberg. Bowen adds immensely‘)
to the solidness of the defense.

— Perhaps the most pressing question on campus
these days is “Will the Panthers ever score more than
20 points in a game.” Though Pitt defeated Kansas

on Saturday 18-3, the game was disappointing to the ‘ ”

extent it was not a blow-out. The offense was im-

' pressive in every phase of it’s game except in scoring.

This week, it is extremely important for Pitt to im-
pressively, and that means scoring at least 40 point
defeat a weak Temple team. ‘
Although Pitt won its first two games, it has drop-
ped three places in the AP poll. The reason is that
such big gainersas Nebraska, Penn State, Texas and
Ohio State have all won their games bywide‘ margins.
When Ohio State wins 47-0 and Nebraska 57-0
against the same quality opponents Pitt has played,
the Panthers have got to get in gear to live up to all

 

third in the AP poll.

 

the preseason publicity. After all, this is the same
team who was picked number one by both the New
York Times and Sports Illustrated, and predicted

_ That preseason hype gave Pitt fans and students vi-
sions of sugar canes, Bear Bryant and the Superdome
on New Year’s Day. Flights to'New Orleans from
Pittsburgh were booked solid for New Year’s by
hopeful football fans. The opening game must have
caused half of them to tear up their airline tickets.
Pitt has a strong sense of football tradition and a ’
number one ranking is taken very seriously. Every
since 1976 when Pitt won it’s last national title, the
Panthers have been on the prowl for another. The
1977 season opened with high hopes of the title

defense but those hopes were shot down when senior
quarterback Matt Cavanaugh went down in the
opener against Notre Dame with a broken wrist. Pitt
still managed to finish 9-2-1 that -year, but there was
no second national championship. '
The Panthers then went through a disappointing

8-4 season in 1978. The offense was blamed for be-
ing lack-luster and though 8-4 is usually considered a
successful season, Pitt fans were not happy. The
1979 season began with a lot of hope but a realization
that this was not to be the year. The lack luster of-
fense wasn’t solved, and although the team possessed

. a super defense, not much chance was given to Pitt
for finishing in the top 20:
After a tough 17-7 loss at North Carolina in the se-
cond game of the year, the Panthers jelled under
freshman quarterback‘ Dan Marino. Though only a
‘starter in four regular season, games, Marino passed
for 1,680 yards, fourth best in Pitt history. Pitt end-
ed the season on a tear, winning 10 straight and
finishing with a sixth place ranking in the final poll.
With 16 of the 22 starters returning for the 1980
season, high hopes began building for an extra
special season. Dan Marino had ained valuable ex-

'\

perience the year before to carry him into the ’80

campaign. Fullback Randy McMillan was the

answer to Pitt’s need for the bruising, punishing type

runner. The offensive line was as big physically as

any team in the nation. The smallest member of that

group is LG Paul Dunn, who is 6-4 and 255 pounds.

Mark May, senior RT, is the biggest at 6-6 and 275

pounds. ~

- With the offense showing vast improvement, at-
tention was focused on the defense. Led by “all-
world” defensive end Hugh Green, the Panther
defense seemed to be the most awesome in college
football. Green, at 6-2 and 222 -pounds, runs the
40-yard dash in 4.5 seconds. ‘The rest of Hugh’as
linemates are even bigger. MG Jerry Boyarski is 6-3
and 275 pounds, RT Bill Neill is 6-5 and 255, Greg

 

is 6-3 and 217.

The doorway to the Panther lockerroom at Pitt
Stadium has a sign above it that reads, -“Beware. . .
Through these doors walk the meanest, nastiest, win-
ningest Cats in the nation. . .The Pitt Panthers.”

Yet, despite all the attention, hype and bragging,
the meanest Cats in the nation looked like anything

- but that against Boston College and Kansas. The old
saying that football games are not won on paper, but
won on the field is true. This Pitt Panther team is not
overrated. This team is one of the most talented
teams, if not the most talented team, ‘in the ‘nation.

back.” Trocano said, “so I never
really concentrated too much on
defense. Now that I’m playing it
here at Pitt l’ve had to learn all of
the coverages and that was hard,”
he added.

The Boston College game was his

first real test at safety and Trocano

showed why he belonged. He made

numerous tackles. by coming up ‘

strong on runs. He had no reserva-
tions about running to the line of

scrimmage, where “the behemouths '

of the game make their living, and
mixing it up with the ballcarriers.
As Trocano sees it, this quarter-

“Being a former quaterback,” he

.said “I can tell what’s coming up, a

pass or.a run, just by watching the
quarterback. I can read his techni-
que and play accordingly. It’s
helped me a great deal.” -

He’s playing safety," a position
with a great deal of responsibility
due to the fact that he’s the last line
of defense. But does he miss being
the quarterback?

“No, not really,” he said. “I en-
joyed playing quaterback for a cou-
ple, years, but I really am satisfied

right now.”

The -season is only two games old
but already the Panthers are among

the nation’s leaders in total"

defense(4th). Trocano has had a
hand inthat and it’s a credit to him
that he has. Few people can make a
transition from quarterback to safe-
ty as succesfully as he has.

By ANNA ARLOTTA
Pitt News Sports Writer

Determination, willpower and ex-
perience are just three words that
can be used to describe the Panther‘
booter’s center forward Bob
Hughes, the man in the middle of
the front line of attack. In-five
games played this season, Hughes
has showed those qualities and
more in the form of one goal and
‘three assists. .

In the Panthers 2-1 victory over
CMU last Wednesday, Hughes suc-
cessfully placed the ball to his right
and found wing Eric Tiedtke
waiting to finish the play. That he
it) did and the Panthers were up 10.

Hughes has taken over a new role

this year with the Pitt booters, a

position that requires him to focus

on the art of passing the ball to

  

 

others to score the goals. A look to
the left and a look to the right and
Hughes is ready to chip the ball to
anyone who’s ready to put a _ball in
the net. '
“I’m playing a different role
now,”'said Hughes. “I’m a feeder,
unlike before when I trailed on the
front line. Either way though, I
have to be defensive throughout the
game and not just an attacker. Now

my task is to get the ball to someone.

to score. .
“That is just as important as
scoring is,” he added. “It feels just
as good to assist on a goal or to
make a goodepass as it "does to score
a goal. It’s not really important
who scores the goal, as long as so-
meone does it. Especially when
‘we’ re winning, I just pass the ball to
Eric and let him do it: He’s really

 

\‘.

developed into a great goal scorer.”
Looking back to Hughes, first

year with the Panthers one can see
that he was an excellent goal scorer,
too. In 1977, his freshman year,
Hughes scored 11 goals as he
started in the center forward posi-

_ tion over an already established
veteran. Hughes came to Pitt with a
good deal of credentials ‘under his
belt. The recruit from Philadelphia
was looked uponto develop into‘ an
excellent player for the Pitt booters.
As a senior at Central High School

- in Philadelphia, Hughes was named
the high scorer in the city league
with 26 goal_s._That same year he
made the all—public and all-city
squads as he had done the two years
previous to that. He‘ captained the
team his senior year.

Fortunately for coach Leo'Bemis .

I ‘ '

O
and the Panthers, Hughes chose to
attend school in Pittsburgh, turning
down such places as Temple, Ur-
sinus, and West Chester. _

“Pitt was a‘ pretty established
team when I came here,” said
Hughes. “It was a very' good
recruiting year because it was that
season that people like Danny
Hamm, Barry Stein, Jerry Buirge,
and Johnny O’Hara were recruited.
It was disappointing, though, when
we didn’t have a good season that
year. Knowing that you have the
potential .only means that you
haven’t done it yet.”

A bit of confusion with Pitts’
academics forced Hughes to miss
his sophomore year _of eligibility
with the Panthers. Hughes was pro-
venacademically ineligable to that
season but was not_told by athletic

department until halfway through
the first week of training camp.
Athletes are supposed to be inform-
ed of such a situation long before
that date, he said.

“It was disappointing as hell to
have that happen to you,” said
Hughes. “Coming back ready and
not being able to play really slapped
me right in the face. But then I"
knew that I had three more coming
and I was just going to have to start
all over again. The experience
motivated me if nothing else.”

Looking to this season, and the I

entire Panther team have been
working under a great deal of
motivation to boost their present
record to 3-2. One of those two
losses came by one goal to Slippery
Rock last weekend. Hughes believes
that the Panthers have had two con-
secutive good recruiting years and
should be able to have a winning
year. , '

“Last season we had a good
recruting year bringing in Eric, and
John Pizzella and Tom Trempus. It
was a big year similar to when I was
a freshman. It took "a while to get
used to everyone, all the new faces,
butnow they have all got a year of
experience ‘under them. This year

we had another good year bringing,

in players like Chris Richmond,
Don Bowen, and Gerry Wasson.

Last year there was a lot of in-~

dividual talent but that didn’t make

'a team. Now everyone is gelling

together more.”

The remainder of this season
looks to be a succesful one in the
eyes of Hughes.

' “If we can stay healthy we’re go-
ing to keep moving up and up,”
said ' Hughes. “I look at the

goalkeeping of Scott Thunberg and _\
it reminds me of the days when I

was a freshman and we had Frank
Bucci back there in the nets. It’s
good to feel confident in your
goalie. It helps a great deal through
out" the game.” Hughes thinks
highly of his teammates as they do
of him. ‘ "

“He’s steadily improved,” said
Danny Hamm, a fellow recruit
from three years ago. “His skill and
on thefiels knowledge of the game
have progressed to the point where
many of the younger players look

up to him for leadership and help

PUBLIC NOTICE TO STUDENTS

Section 438 or the General Education Provision Act, as amended
by Section 513 of Public Law 93-568, referred to as the “Privacy
Rights of Parents and Students,” (more commonly called the

“Buckley Amendment”) requires that Pitt give notice to parents and_

students of the following information.

-The Buckley Amendment is designed to protect the privacy of
students. In order to do so, these provisions are binding on the
University: ' . -

- Individual student records include only information necessary
and relevant to the educational purposes of the institution.

- Student records are open for inspection by students or the '

parents of students under the age of 18, upon request, with the ex-_
ception that letters of recommendation written prior to January 1,
1957, remain confidential. Additionally, specific documents that
students have waived their right to inspect remain conﬁdential.

- Students have a right tochallenge the accuracylof records.

- The institution may not release student records outside the in- .
stitution without student consent, unless one of several exceptions

aprlies. . ‘ P

— Requests external to the institution for informatioh regarding
students should be documented, as should releases of student infor-
“mation. ‘  . ‘ ’

- The University may establish categories of information, known
as “Director'Information” and release this information upon re-
quest by individuals external to the institution. This may be done on-
ly after students are provided the opportunity to request exclusion
from the Directory.

Greater specificity and further information regarding exceptions
may be obtained in 604 Schenley Hall. ‘ _

The University of Pittsburgh will not be publishing a “Student
Directory” in 1980-81 according to Charlene C. Hunter from the Office
of Special Student Services. There will, however, be an “in house"
directory which is to be used by several administrative offices in-
cluding the Office of Student Affairs. The “in house" directory is used
to locate students, inform news media of student accomplishments and
respond to legitimate external requests for information regarding
students. ‘ « ' 7

In order to produce this directory the University must according to
the “Privacy Rights of Parents and Students” more commonly'refer-
red to as the “Buckley Amendment,” afford students the opportunity
to remove their names and personally identifiable information from the
directory. . -

' Mrs. Hunter indicated that she hopes that few students will exercise
this right because the types of releases made byithe offices having ac-
cess _to the “In House Directory” generally benefit the ‘student.
Releases will not be made -to advertisers, insurance companies, and
other groups or organizations. A form is available to stutﬁnts who
wish to remove themselves and the following identifiable information
from the directory: .

Name I
_Address

Phone I

Major Field of Study

Academic Honors

Membership or Office Held with Organizations

Participation in Athletics ‘
. Awards or Honors for Special Accomplishments‘

The following form should be completed and returned to Room 604

Schenley Hall by Oct. 3, 1980.
