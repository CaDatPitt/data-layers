Despite Letters, Adminstrotors Believe Research Vital

By JEFF COUCH
Pitt News Slaffwriter

Recent Pitt News letters to the
editor have expressed concern over
the role of teaching and the balance
between teaching and research.

In response, university officials
have said that research is an
important part of a faculty
member’s responsibilities but that
teaching cannot be sacrificed in
favor of research.

Ray Steele. assistant to the
provost, said that research aids
faculty members with their class-
room duties.

“A faculty member cannot be
effective in the classroom without a
base in scholarship which includes
the capacity to do the research
function,” he said. “A com-
mitment to the discovery of new
knowledge helps make what is
taught more relevant.”

Irwin Schulman, dean of the
College of Arts and Sciences, said
that research is an important part
of a faculty member’s job.

 

IRWIN J. SCHULMAN

“More often than not, the best
scholars are the best teachers,”
Schulman said. “People not doing
research lose contact with their
field.”

In order to become tenured at the
university, according to Steele, a
faculty member must show evi-
dence of ‘being a good teacher
through an evaluation of teaching.

“It is terribly essential that their

dossier does not just show research-

butalso teaching,” he said.

Jerome Rosenberg, dean of the
Faculty of Arts and Sciences, said
that a faculty member must show
evidence of research and the ability
to teach before he/ she is tenured.

“We expect the faculty to be
good in both scholarship and the
committment to teaching,” he
said.

According to Steele, students
hear more about research grants
than good teaching because of the
publicity which results from re-
ceiving grants. ‘

“When you really effect and
stimulate students (through teach-
ing), it is harder to get this
publicity,” Steele said.

A faculty member who believes
there is not enough emphasis on
quality teaching is Peter Lipow,
assistant professor of mathematics
and statistics.

In a recent letter to the editor,
Lipow complained that the univer-

Honorary Council Marks First

Jack Daniel, associate dean of
the Faculty of Arts and Sciences,
was the keynote speaker at an
Inter-Honorary Council banquet
Friday.

The banquet marked the first
year of the council's existence and
the end ot its 1979 "Academic

Dav,” which featured scholarly
debates held Friday morning and
afternoon in the Student Union
Kurtzman Room.

Daniel spoke on the need for
humanism in an intellectual
approach to social problems.

“Higher education in 1979 has
become dehydrated of social
response, Daniel said, “We
should honor the intellectually
talented but not honor young

people as sterile machines with
minds of photographic material.”

Daniel argued that emphasis on
intellectual pursuit left little room
in society for humanitarianism, and
called for merging of the two
pursuits.

“Einstein wanted to be re-
membered for his scientific contri-
butions and for his social contri-
butions," he stated. “Emotions
must not be forgotten. (We) need
to preserve our human qualities.”

Daniel cited the pursuit of
intellectual excellence at Pitt
noting that at the same time
“(There are) people within the
university without decent hous-
ing.” ‘

Kenny Clark, instructor and,
drummer for Pitt's jazz ensemble,
received a special award from the
council honoring his excellence in
teaching and applying new teach-
ing methods.

David Rossi, president of
Omicron Delta Kappa leadership
organization, was honored as

“Senior of the Year” at the
banquet
“We’ve (members of Inter-

Honorary Council) shown we can
do some real original things, that
people in honoraries aren’t just the
type who go home and study all
day,” said council president Mark‘

Morrisey. “They play an active
part in "social and leadership
workshops and the “Academic

Day”, which he termed “a debated
(format) which will stand for years
to come.”

 

JEROME ROSENBERG

sity emphasizes hiring researchers
who care little about undergrad-
uate teaching.

Lipow believes that good teach-
ing is not encouraged at the
university and that teaching counts
much less than research for faculty
promotions.

“The system at Pitt is designed
so people are not rewarded for the

work they put into teaching,” he
said. “If the administration is
serious about it, what they would
do is require faculty members to be
evaluated.’ ’ I
Lipow said that there is a conﬂict

between good undergraduate_

teaching and research. Prepar-
ation for classes takes away from
research time, he said.

“I’m'not sure things are going to
change; it certainly is not a
problem unique to Pitt,” Lipow
stated.

Steele said the provost’s office
has a definite commitment to good
teaching and continually working
on improving teaching through the
offices of Faculty Development and
Teaching Evaluation.

The two offices were created
largely as a result of recommenda-
tions by the Committee on the
Evaluation of Teaching, formed in
dations by the Committee on the
Evaluation of Teaching, formed in
1975 because of concern by

Another St. Patrick's Day has come and gone.
Likewise, so has another Engineer's Week at
Pitt. with this year's theme based on comic
strips, engineering students celebrated in honor
of the world's first engineer, St. Patrick.
The week long festivities were kicked off last
Monday and included such gatherings as a
Blood Drive, Parent's Night, Game Night, a
parade and last Friday's Shamrock Ball. Pitt
News photographers Cindi Evangelista and Dave
Blais captured the action on film. Page 8

taking it in context of what they're

One of the more popular
methods of helping faculty mem-
bers, according to Wolke, is
through a classroom videotaping
service. Faculty members may
have their classes taped, followed
by a private viewing with or
without a consultant. The
consultant can provide advice to

the faculty member on his or her

Other programs designed to help

Greeks Sing To Initiate

'Greafesi‘ Show On Earl

By GARY L. TWEED

Pitt News Staff Writer _ _ _ '
Annual ‘Greek Week festivities

began Saturday night at Carnegie
Music Hall. Nineteen fraternities
and sororities performed in the
kick-off event titled “Greek Sing.”
The show attracted, for the first
time in recent years, a capacity
crowd. Talented members of both
sororities‘ and fraternities per-
formed acts that ranged ' from
choreographical arrangements to
broadway musical numbers to
combined musical/ dance acts.
Alpha Epsilon Phi sorority per-
formed scores from the musical
“I’m A Yankee Doodle Dandy.”

Delta Zeta sorority put out thier
version of “Puttin’ On The Ritz,”
while Kappa Alpha Theta brought
down the house with “Another
Opening, Another Show.”

Choreographiéal talent was dis-
played by Delta Phi fraternity as
they did “Singing In The Rain,”
and Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity did
an instrumental and dance spin-off

of comedians John Belushi and
Dan Akroyd's "The Blues
Brothers” routine, performing
under the title “The Blues Boys."

Greek Week is billed this vear as
“The Greatest Show On Earth,”
and is sponsored by Panhellenic

h’
Association and Inter-Fraternity
Council.

Greek organizations participating
in “Greek Sing” attempted to
score points evaluated on per-
formance excellence to be tallied in
finding a winner for the week’s
festivities.

T

Upcoming Greek Week events
include a traditional chariot race to
be held on Bigclow Boulevard
today at noon, a talent night
Tuesday, an all-Greek mixer
Wednesday night and an all-Greek
formal Friday at the Hilton Hotel
downtown.

Need
For
Fee Increase

Todd Park, a member of the Student Government
Board, raised a serious question at the Thursday
meeting of the Student Affairs Advisory committee

or that must be given serious consideration in the

following weeks. Park asked what the procedures
for raising the student activities fee was and said. that
an increase was needed because climbing inflation
and dropping enrollment have cut revenues of the
SGB.

From all indications, Park’s comments appear to
be true. Inflation has risen by an average eight per-
cent in the ‘last year alone, while total revenues for
the SGB decreased approximately $12,000 in the last
year. As a result, the $12 a semester activities fee ac-
tually has supplied less money to meet the needs of
Pitt's student organizations. Some groups have
already felt the impact of this drop in funds.
Black Action Society received a $4,300 cut in its
allocation this year from student government. Still,
the groups to suffer most from decreasing student

government revenues are those that have not received
their allocations for this year—-student clubs af-
filiated with the SGB.

The budget cuts these groups received during last
year’s allocations are now history. Such diverse
groups as the Amateur Radio Association, Circle K
and the Hockey Club all suffered drops in the
amount of funds they received from the SGB, when
compared to amounts they requested. This situation
cannot be condoned when these small groups are
ones in which most students are involved and are
most important to Pitt students with radically varied
interests.

To stop these incessant budget cuts, we support an
increase in the student activities fee. It is obvious
that the $12 activities fee, which has not been in-
creased since 1966, is a paltry sum that no longer
provides the needs of student clubs and organizations
that are a vital part of an educational experience at
Pitt. Although onerous to students already, strapped
with constant increases in dormitory fees and tuition,

such an increase is the only possible answer if student
organizations here are to survive.

Any increase in the student activities fee, however,
should not be seen as blanket permission for the SGB
to meet without question the demands for more
money from student organizations. The board must
be forever vigilant in its evaluation of allocation
requests and OK only those that are necessary, and
benefit students as a group.

One area where student government could better
meet the needs of students is giving a more sym-
pathetic ear to requests of the smaller clubs on cam-
pus. They do not include many members at times,

Page 6—Monday, March 19, 19794

but they offer to various students what they want and
need.

While student government must continue to
guarantee fiscal restraint, student groups also must
keep their budgets reasonable. It is ridiculous for
any group, even the Inter-Fraternity Council, to ask
for a 575 percent increase in its allocation. Instead of
burdening the SGB allocations committee with such

. impossible requests,'student organizations must con-

sider their real needs when they develop their
budgets.

If this increase in the activities fee is approved, it is
important that the SGB not look to increased fees as
the answer to every fiscal problem it faces. Such an
attitude is in the end both irresponsible and
unrealistic. Any government body—the university,
the state or the nation—must practice austerity at all
times and not burden its citizens with rate increases
indiscriminately.

mean by that is they have in no way
reached their potential as insti-

tutional alternatives and survival"

mechanisms. It is one of the main
functions and responsibilities of
black students to assist in making
these vital organs sufficient.

The way this can be done is very
simple in theory; however, it
requires a lot of struggle in
practice. By using these organi-
zations in new and different ways
and by having them do what they
have not yet done, we exercise and
strengthen ourselves through the
effort. This does not have to be
done out of negative attitudes or
frameworks (shame, blame and
guilt).

We must not fail to recognize,
however, that these organizations
were created out of struggle and
will have to grow through struggle.
This does not mean we have to
fight each other, but only means
that in exercising the muscles, they

resist and ache. I feel that at this
time black students need to focus
their energy inward toward them-
selves as well as their extensions
(BAS, black studies and UCEP).

Because of budget cuts by the
university we are losing any chance

of developing these organizations
and ourselves in any quantitative
way. Through our lack of
enlightened self-interest and in-
volvement we are losing any
chance to develop them in a
qualitative way. Please get

involved in your organizations.
Get involved in yourself.

Support Striking Shipbuilders Today

On Jan. 30 over 15,000 shipyard
workers, organized into United
Steel Workers local 8888 and went
on strike-to demand recognition of
their union by the giant Tenneco
corporation.

This fight is of special signifi-
cance for steelworkers, and conse-
quently. for anyone living in the
Pittsburgh area, including Pitt
students. When the workers of
Newport News voted one year ago
for the United Steel Workers, it
was the biggest organizing victory
since the battles that consolidated
the industrial unions of the 1940s
and could represent for the working
class of the South what the 1937

autoworkers sit-down strike in
Flint, Michigan meant for the
initiation of mass union organizing
of that era.

The employers, for their part
understand the signiﬁcance of what
a Steelworkers’ victory would
mean.

It would mean that non-union
workers across the South would be
inspired to take on their own
bosses. It would show to other
workers, both in the South and
North, how the unity of Black and
white, men and women, and young
and old workers can beat back any
attack launched against them by
the employers.

To date, the Tenneco conglom-
erate has refused to negotiate.
Tennecois representing all corpor-
ations in trying to stand up to one
of the largest industrial unions in
the United States. Their common
goal is to crush militant labor
unionism in this country and set the
clock back 50 years.

Tenneco is using a tremendous
amount of power to deny basic
democratic rights to its workers.
The employers have organized

their side with every means at their

disposal state police, court injunc-
tions, and, if they desire it, the
U.S. Navy.

Can the members of USWA local
8888 stand up against such odds?

Many people around the country
thought last year’s strike by the
United Mine Workers was going to
be smashed, but the ' miners
showed that cops, attack dogs,
court injunctions and the power of
the federal government could not
stand up to working people of the
black movement, women’s move-
ment and student movement.

Key to a successful struggle, as
with the miners, will be the
involvement of other steelworkers,
women’s groups, student organiza-
tions, and black and civil rights
groups. An example of this will be
the solidarity rally to be held at the
university at 7 p.m. on Monday,
March 19 in Clapp Hall.

As the workers in Newport News
shout in theface of Tenneco: “It’s
Steelworkers tim’e———it’s freedom

Engineers Show

The Parade (Thursday)—featuring floats
by different engineering groups.

Themes for floats seemed to center
around comics: the electrical engineers’
float was based on the comic strip “The
Wizard of ld,” the civils had “Peanuts,”
mining used “Beetle Bailey,” freshman
engineers had “B.C.,” and Triangle, the
engineering fraternity, entered a float on
“The Jetsons. ”

Engineer’s Week was five days of well-

deserved fun for Pitt students, but don’t

count on things settling back to normal on

°~’j""Pus iust yet——Greek Week is just begin-
nmg.

Spirit During Week B

St. Patrick's Day is traditionally a great day
for the Irish, but at Pitt, the festivities start
prior to the holiday and focus on another
group—the engineers.

Engineer’s Week kicked off last Monday
(March 12) with a two day Blood Drive for
charity and Parent's Night, and wound up
Friday night at the Syria Mosque with the
Shamrock Ball. In between, the engineers
carried on with more of the traditional
events:

Game Night and Gimmicks on the lawn
(Wednesday)—including the annual Tug of
War.

Swimmers Finish Twelfth In Country  

Stetler, Relays
Lead Pantherettes;

6 Florida Wins
National Tile

By JEFF DUROSKO
Pitt News Staff Writer

Florida's Gators won the team title, but
Texas freshman Joan Pennington stole the
show at the Association of Intercollegiate
Athletics for Women (AIAW) swimming
championships last weekend at Trees Hall
pool.

Pennington took top honors in four events,
setting AIAW records in all four and

American records in two. Pennington won the
100-yard butterﬂy in 54.44 and the 200-yard

Jdividual medley in 2:00.81.

SMU’ Janet Ely Thorburg soars to a victory in AIAW three-meter competition.
She also won the one-meter event.

Pantherette gymnastics coach
Donna DeMarino Sanft will be
nervously awaiting the moment
when bids to nationals are given
out Wednesday. Pitt placed third
in a ﬁeld of 14 teams in the Eastern
regional championships lastiweek-
end, scoring a “borderline” 133.40
points.

“Our chances of making nation-
als are good, but not great," said
Sanft. “If we make it, we'll just
make it, and if we don't, we’ll just
miss it."

Pitt had its best day this season
in the vault and uneven bars,
according to Sanft.

ln.the vault, Myra Bachuchin
(9.1). Roxanne .,Evans (9.05) and
Holly Martino (8.35) all made it to
ﬁnals. The team score was 35.4,
the highest vaulting score of the
season. In the vaulting ﬁnals,
Bachuchin placed ﬁfth, which gave
her a spot on the all-East team.
Evans was eighth and Martino
10th.

-Srakoclc photo.

The same three Pantherettes

Bachuchin was the highest

American records in the 50-yard butterfly with
a 24.91 time and the 100-yard individual
medley, finishing in 56.24.

“I’ve gone my fastest,” said Pennington.-
“I’ll just have to try and do better next year.”

Pitt’s swimmers placed 12th in the team
race and ﬁve Pantherettes achieved All-
America status. Kathy Stetler, Amy Jackson,
Suzanne Pulley, Linda Frankenbach and Julie
Terrell all placed in the top eight in at least
one event.

Pitt’s best performance was turned in by
the 200-yard freestyle relay. The team of
Jackson, Pulley, Terrell and Stetler ﬁnished
third, breaking the AIAW record and ﬁnishing
in 1:35.47. Going into Stetler’s anchor leg of
the relay, the Pantherettes were in sixth-place
at best. Stetler brought Pitt up to third place
with a split of 23.10.

“We all had really good swims,” said
Stetler. “We thought that we had a really
good chance at winning, and everybody knew
what they had to do and they did it.”

Arizona State won the event, breaking both
the American and AIAW records. The team of
Allison Grant, Peggy Tosdal, Sue Sloan and
Anne Gagnon ﬁnished in 1:34.31.

Stetler placed ﬁfth in the 50-yard freestyle
in 23.84. Southern California's Sue
Hinderaker won the event, ﬁnishing in 23.17,
just a shade off her own American and AIAW
record time of 23.14.

Stetler also placed in the 50-yard butterﬂy
(11th) and 100-yard freestyle (13th). She was
national champion in the 50-ﬂy last year, but
failed to make it to the championship round
this time. Arizona State’s Gail Amundrud
successfully defended her title in the 100-free,
winning in AIAW record time of 50.62.

The only other Pitt competitors to make .it to
the ﬁnals were the 400-yard freestyle relay
ream of Terrell, Jackson, Stetler and
Frankenbach. The four Pantherettes ﬁnished
in 3:30.04, good enough for seventh place.
Arizona State broke the AIAW record in
winning the relay. Cheryl Gibson, Amundrud,
Tosdal and Sloan ﬁnished in 3:23.72 to defend
their title.

Florida, in winning the national champion-
ship, had a more balanced attack than most
teams. The Gators took few ﬁrst-places, but
qualiﬁed several swimmers for each cham-
pionship ﬁnal.

However, the Gators did have a
high-scoring individual in Renee Laravie. She
took top honors in the 100-yard breaststroke,
setting a new AIAW record with a time of
1:03.31. Laravie also ﬁnished second twice,
and third once. She wound up in third-place

5 in individual scoring, totaling 87 points.

Pennington won the individual scoring title
with 97 points. Stanford’s Linda Jezek, a
three-time individual national champion, was

   

also made it to the ﬁnals of the
uneven bars. Evans scored an 8.7,
Bachuchin 8.5 and Tressler 8.4.
Evans made the all-East team by
placing sixth, while Bachuchin and
Tressler placed eighth and 12th,
respectively.

According to Sanft. the floor
exercise was scored low, and Pitt
did well in comparison to others.
Martino was the only Pantherette
to make the ﬁnals by scoring 8.5.
She missed making the all-East
team by ﬁve one-hundreds of a
point, due to a four-way tie for sixth
place. She ﬁnished ninth.

In the ﬁnal event, the balance
beam, Pitt’s “old nemisis,”
according to Sanft. “everyone fell
all over the place.” Tressler was
the only Pantherette who didn’t
fall, and made the ﬁnals. Her score
of 8.55 in the preliminaries along
with 8.7 in the ﬁnals were good
enough to place her eighth. She
missed making the all-East team by
two-tenths of a point.

Pantherette ﬁnisher in the all-
around. She was 10th among 170
competitors, scoring 33.65 points.
Tressler was 11th (33.45), Evans
13th (33.2) and Martino 14th (33.1).

Clarion’s Ann Woods won the
all-around, scoring 36.50, while
teammate Nancy Jones was
runner-up with 36.30. Penn State’s
Marci Levine was third with a total
of 35.65.

The team title was won by
defending national champion Penn
State. The Lady Lions edged
runner-up Clarion, 141.3-141.2.
Behind third-place Pitt were
Massachusetts and New Hamp-
shire; both defeated Pitt at
Easterns last year.

“It was a really proﬁtable
meet." said Sanft. “Everybody
was saying, ‘Where did Pitt come
from?’ I think that we made a really
big impression on a lot of people."

According to Sanft, poise and
conﬁdence are important aspects of
gymnastics.

second with 90 points.

J ezek won the 100-yard backstroke in 55.69,
setting a new AIAW record. She also took top
honors in the 50-yard backstroke, beating out
defending champion Tauna Vanderweghe of
UCLA. Her time of 26 seconds ﬂat is a new
American and AIAW record. Jezek won the
200-yard backstroke Thursday.

Other weekend winners include Jo Clark of
Stanford in the 1650-yard freestyle, with a
time of 16:25.99. Debbie Rudd of USC won
the 200-yard breastroke, setting a new AIAW
record in 2:16.32. Arizona State’s Amundrud
took top honors in the 200-yard freestyle
ﬁnishing in 1:48.47 and Houston’s Diane
J ohannigman retained her title in the 200-yard
butterfly with a time of 1:59.42.

Stanford’s 400-yard medley relay team set a
new AIAW record, winning in 3:46.89. Diane
Girard of Texas was the winner of the
400-yard individual medley, setting a new
AIAW record time of 4:18.67.

In the three-meter diving, Janet Ely

Thorburn of SMU became a double winner by ‘

edging out Ohio State’s Kerry Finneran by
only three points. Thorburn also won the
one-meter diving Thursday night. Pitt
freshman Hillary McBride placed 36th, just
missing the ﬁrst cut by two points.

Florida head coach Randy Reese said that
he was “down” after the meet because his
team swam poorly.

“I guess the team was looking forward to
the AAU’s (Amateur Athletic Union’s'
championships),” he said. ‘‘I’m glad it didn’ t
cost us the meet.” M

Reese played down the championships
because, he said, “The AAU’s are what really
keeps college girls swimming. They weren’t
brought up dreaming of getting scholarships,
but of going to the Olympics.”

Pantherette head coach Dick Bradshaw said
he was pleased with the Pantherettes’
performance. Pitt’s 12th-place ﬁnish was two
notches better than last year’s ﬁnal team
standing.

“Sometimes when you host a national
championship, your team suffers,” he said.
“I was glad that it didn’t happen to us.”

Ten Pantherettes qualiﬁed for the nation-
als, ﬁve made All-America.

“When a team does that well,” said
Bradshaw, “you’ve just got to be happy.”

WHEN?
WHERE?
WHY?

’ Next Fall.

By JEFF DUROSKO ,
Pitt News Staff Writer

It’s not every day Pitt hosts a
national championship event. In
fact, Pitt hasn’t hosted one since
1963, when the men’s gymnastics
championships were held here.

The Pantherette swim team
hosted the Association of Intercol-
legiate Athletics for Women
(AIAW) championships last week
(the first women’s nationals ever to
be held here) with all the
excitement, color and controversy

that goes, with an event of this L

caliber.

Teams from Alabama to Yale,
Hawaii to Boston University and
from Maine to Florida were
represented.

Wall-to-wall signs were hung
supporting nearly every competi-
tor.

Television cameras were rolling
and photographers’ cameras click-
ing. a

Near-sell-out crowds were pre-
sent each evening and a general
feeling of tension and excitement
filled the air.

Pitt freshman Julie Terrell said,
“It didn’t hit me until we arrived at
the pool on Wednesday and saw all
the other girls from across the
country. Iwas super-excited. I
thought, ‘Oh my gosh...’ and it
really got me psyched.”

Cutting through this air of
‘ ‘ super-excitement’ ’ was contro-
versy on the first night ‘of ﬁnals,
Thursday.

Stanford’s women wore suits
which, although technically one--
piece, bore resemblence to bikinis

with a spaghetti-thin strap connec-
ting the two pieces in the back.

This was Stanford’s surprise
psych-out, according to their coach,
Jim Gaughan. Apparently, it
worked to a us degree, because
Gaughan’s team was ahead in the
team scoring batttle after Thurs-
day.

Suit designer Steve Lee said he
was going to pass the suits out to
the other swimmers on the
following day. He evidently did,
because on Friday, swimmers from
Colorado State, Southern California
and Penn State wore the suits.

After the controversy died down,
the topic of conversation shifted to
how well-run the meet was.

In her opening of Saturday
night’s competition, Texas’ Donna
Lopiano, AIAW commissioner for
large college national champion-
ships said, “I’d like to thank the

     
       

Cl 061 -0811

 

I SwimHostPittPraisedbyCoaches  

University of Pittsburgh for holding Q,

the finest AIAW swimming cham-
pionships that we’ve ever had.”

Winning coach Randy Reese of
Florida agreed with Lopiano, and
said Pitt's was the best women’s
nationals he’d ever attended.

According to coaches, competi-
tors and officials, Pitt head coach
Dick Bradshaw, assistant coach
Kate Mathison and publicity
director Joyce Aschenbrenner did a
fine job in organizing the event.

The three organizers agreed the
meet took more work than they’d
ever had to do before for a single
event.

‘‘It was a lot of hard work,” said
Aschenbrenner. “Since Tuesday,
the people involved in organization
of the meet have gotten only about
four hours of sleep each night.
But, the success of the meet should
do a lot for the AIAW.”

Bradshaw and Lopiano both said
the event has, in the past, been a
disaster due to lack of organization.

This all brings to mind an
interesting question. Will Pitt
submit bids to host other national
championship events in the near
future?

No one can say for sure, of
course, but it surely wouldn’t do
the university much harm public-
ity-wise, to have its name spread
across the country in newspapers
and on TV. But. is all the glory
worth the time and effort put into
the event.

Bradshaw said it best when
asked if he would agree to host the
swimming nationals again.

“Maybe in about 10 years."

Michigan St., DePaul, Indiana st., Penn nan. Fi'naI Four

By The Associated Press

Michigan State earned a trip to
the NCAA’s Final Four for the the
ﬁrst time in 22 years, thanks to the
scoring and rebounding of Greg
Kelser, the ballhandling wizardry
of Earvin Johnson and a sticky zone
defense that Notre Dame never did
master.

The 6-foot-7 Kelser, the only
senior on Michigan State’s squad,
scored a season-high 34 points and
grabbed 13 rebounds yesterday, as

‘‘It’s not how much talent your
team has,” she said. “You need
the confidence. For example,
Bonnie (Tressler) and Myra (Bach-
uchin), who went to nationals last
year showed a great improvement.
They looked like they gained a
year’s experience since the last
regionals. "

Sanft said if Pitt doesn’t make
nationals as a team, it is possible
that all four individuals who went
all-around at Easterns, (Bachuchin,
Evans, Martino and Tressler),

could make it as individuals.

“All we can do now is wait,” she
said.

the third-ranked Spartans beat No.
4 Notre Dame 80-68 for the Mideast
Regional championship. Many of
Kelser’s points came on dazzling
feeds from Johnson, an All-Amer-
ica sophomore who had 13 assists.
‘‘It feels great-I can’t even say
how great,” Johnson said during
the celebration in the Michigan
State locker room. “It has been a
dream of mine to make the Final
Four and now we're there.”
Michigan State. 24-6, will play

NCAA semifinals Saturday, the
victor to face the DePaul-Indiana
State winner for the collegiate
championship March 26.

Notre Dame Coach Digger
Phelps was well aware of Michigan
State’s defensive strategy and
adjusted his game plan accord-
ingly.

“We didn’t want to go inside
because as soon as you go inside
they collapse on you,” said Phelps.

“We felt we had to get the

But Notre Dame’s outside
shooting wasn’t good enough
Sunday. The Irish hit 36 percent
from thefteld in the first half and
46 percent for the game compared
to 57 percent shooting by Michigan
State.

Kelser scored seven straight
baskets during one stretch of the
first half, four of them on assists
from Johnson, helping the Spar-
tans to a 34-23 halftime lead.

Notre Dame, which finished at
24-6, pulled within seven points
early in the second half at 48-41.
But Johnson scored 12 and Kelser
10 from that point on as the
Spartans steadily pulled-away.

Johnson finished with 19 points

Michigan State. Bill Hanzlik and
reserve guard Tracy Jackson led
Notre Dame with 19 points each.
