  

SENATOR GEORGE McGOVERN greets the estimated crowd of 12,000

  

 

at a rally in Market Square last Wednesday at noon.

Standing on Forbes Ave., down-

-town, packed together on all sides‘

without even space of lift a foot let
alone move it, Pittsburghers wait-
ed in Market Square at noon last
Wednesday for the arrival of
Presidential. candidate George
McGovern and his recent touring
partner Senator Edward Kennedy.

Most of the reported 12,000

-strong had arrived by 12:15, 15

minutes after the rally was to
have started.

Forbes Ave. was blocked off at
the New Diamond Market behind
the platform—so a disappointed

 crowd, pushing and shoving to get

near Market Square had to find an
alternative route once word got

- back .that no one could see any-

thing from where they were.

i y The overflow of people found a
path through the corner fruit mar-
ket and on through Murphy’s
amidst unpopular remarks from
the salespeople and rather blatant
profanity from a few older wom-
en trying to get into the market
themselves.

Businessmen and women, stu-
dents, senior citizens, blue collar
workers and very small-children

visible majority.
Two little boys sat on the grass~
with T-shirts reading McGovern

on the front and Come Home
America on the back.

Pole signs were clustered in the
direct center of the crowd, ob-
scuring the view of most in the
back. Shouts of “Put down the
sign, racist pig,” responded t...—'a
sign that read “Leave the bussing
to Greyhound.”

The signs were myriad in mess-
age; from the economy to the war
to one sign.reading “Chappaqui-
dick?” that was found to be es-
pecially unpopular, drawing com-
ments like “Aren’t 3,31 ashamed
of yourself?”

When the sign flailing got out ‘of
hand and shouts of all sorts didn’t
result in the removal of the signs
from the air, one loud voice rang
out “Hey man, de-escalate those
_signs.” And they did.

Finally, on foot, Senators Mc-
Govern and. Kennedy arrived un-
noticed by many but those lining
the streets in the square.

At 1 p.m. with security and cam-
era men surrounding them. Mc-
Govern and Kennedy mounted the

MARIAVN HIRST: New Co-ordinator
of Residence Life
Photo by Mark Lieberman

Hirst came to the Univer-
sity directly from Duquxesne
where she was assistant dean of
the Housing Administration. As
co-ordinator, she will have under
her supervision 65 resident assis-
tants.

Her duties will entail all “non-
business” aspects of the adminis-
trative detail. Her background in-
cludes a B.A. in Physical Educa-
tion from Colorado University, a
M.S. from George Williams, and
Guidance Counseling training at
Duquesne.

Marian Hirst.

Miss Hirst hopes to orient the
resident assistants to the needs
of the students.

Dr. Robinson, who was raised
in Pittsburgh’s East End, attend-
ed Oberlin College for two years
before completing her undergrad-
uate work at Sarah Lawrence. She
is a graduate of the University of

«Pittsburgh Medical School and

started her association with the
Student Health Service in 1968;
ast year she acted as Associate
Medical Director.

When asked what she thought of

~' the‘current Student Health Insur-

ance program, she stated that it

' was one of the most unique health

programs in the country, stressing
the out-patient coverage. She also
pointed out that “Blue Cross” and

. “Blue, Shield” are very involved in
 the program and their represen-

tatives will be available to an-_
swer any questions concerning- the

 plan in the Student Health Service,

Monday through Friday —— 8 a.m.
to 4 p.m.—-until Sept. 25. “The pro-
gram should have exposure,” she

emphasized.

Does she hope to initiate any
changes in the Student Health
Service? "I’m more concerned
with keeping the programs we
have working well,” she com-
mented, citing in particular. the
psychiatric department.

Dr. Robinson would like to see
the end of the two-hour waiting
period for health services.

She concluded by stating that
one of her aspirations is to en-
courage more nurse participation
in the programs.'She views “pa-
tient contact.’_’ as highly impor-
tant in thehealth services.

one regret of the election,‘ that “on,

election day when George McGov-
ern is elected—Mr. Nixon will be
so mad... he’s never going to tell us
his secret peace plan.”

Kennedy targeted his state-
ments at Richard Nixon, asking in
one instance “Whatright does Mr.
Nixon have to talk about Senator

McGovern’s welfare plan?” and ’
went on to review a series of '
shortcom- V

Nixon’s “economic

Relating his meetings with peo-

ple across the country, Kennedy

found them, “Fed up in Chicago

Pittsburgh . . . fed up with a war
that will not end . . . fed up with

Spiro Agnew and fed up with Rich-  ~

Centrex to Improve Inadequate Service

Phone Service Revamped 

by KARL BALDYS

“I think we we will cast the lot
by Sept. 15 for BellTelephone to
install Centrex in the dormitory
system,” said Vice Chancellor for
Operations Joseph Dutton.

By next fall, the Pitt dormitories
will be" equipped with the new Cen-
trex telephone system. A decision
on the system has been pending
since June. and was concluded
Wednesday night at a meeting of
Residence Hall Advisory
Board with Dutton. John Vrana.
director of University Housing.
and William Nelson. director of
Purchasing. Marlene Lucas. com-
munications coordinator. was
also present.

The system, as outlined by Dut-
ton, will eliminate the present in-
tradormitory phone system. Said
Dutton, “For approximately $40
peryear we would put one phone
in every dorm room . . . the stu-
dent (will have) then, in essence,
a private telephone line.”

With the new system, the stu-
dent could dial directly any num-

ber in the local dialing area of-

Pittsburgh. In addition, after sign-
ing for extended service, he could
call long distance, at his own ex-
pence, from his own room.

Last March the University de-
cided to convert to'Centrex. At
that time, the package did not in-
clude the dormitories. However,

Open Media Committee

by LOIS LEVINSON

Citizen groups and individuals
can express their opinions on
Pittsburgh’s three major televi-
sion stations due to the efforts of
Dr. William Hanks and Dr. Peter
Longini of the Pitt Speech Depart-
ment and the students who helped
them form the Committee for
Open Media (COM).

Broadcasting formerly allowed
for responses only to their own
programs. COM began as a pro-
ject on public access in Hanks’
Mass Media course offered last
spring.

Hanks says, .“I wanted to in-
sure the public more of an initial
say on current issues and provide
a channel through which students

Urges Public Opinion

could directly work on media pro-
jects.”

Longini joined as co—chairman
with student members Phil Mar-
cus, Tyrone Lee, Evan James,
John O’Brien, Kathy Wright, and
Darlene Mitchell. They began to
negotiate for time on behalf of
interested groups.

They‘ visited KDKA, WIIC,
WQED and WTAE several times.
I attended a meeting at KDKA and
found the general managers of
the stations to be courteous, in-

‘ terested, and cautious.

Longini says, “There was ini-
tial apprehensiveness on the sta-
tions’ part. We tried to emphasize

by July, an agreement was reach-V
ed with Bell of Pennsylvania that,
was tabled until Sept. 14, for the » I’
approval of the students. As Dut- 

ton put it, “We feel that this deci-
sion belongs with the students.” ,

The cost of Centrex will be pass-I

housing officials estimated’ $40.

to decrease the costs to two stu- 

dents for one phone. However, sin-

gle room rates would then in-'

crease to cover costs.

The Residence Hall Advisory I

Board, composed of the Executive
Boards of the Women’s Housing
Board and the Men’s Dorm Coun-

 

cil, questioned the administra— 

tors for nearly an hour. Scot
Spadefore, president of the MDC,
asked why the present system
couldn’t be retained. Vrana re-
plied, “If we keep the same phone
service we have now, we would
have to increase the costs to the
students $25-$30 per student

Nelson went on to explain that the
cost of maintenance and opera-

Centrex system.

“Fortunately, our timing was
such as to coincide with an indus-

cess. They saw our proposal as
being a workable mechanism for
trying it out."

"Our only legal recourse." add-

petition against their re-licensing.

with a broad cross-section of pub-
lic opinion and concern, and the
‘responses will permit them to
gauge the amount of general pub-
Iic interest in the topics discussed
during the experiment.”

No member of COM expected
it at the onset, but their negotia-
tionslled to Pittsburgh becoming
the only city besides San Francis-
co to have televised Free Speech
Messages.

The only station not accepting
the program’ was WQED because.

 

they said. it doesn’t fit well in a
public broadcasting format. How-
ever. they plan to work out a sys-
tem whereby access can be ob-
tained on existing shows.

The agreement with ‘WTAE,
KDKA, and WIIC allows for 12
60 second spots per week aired at
different times of day, including
prime time. Each station will car-
ry two or three different spots a
week.

Those interested need only sub-
mit a 150 word message. The sta-
tions will utilize their own facil-
ities to producelthe spots..One
message can be shown by all
three stations on different weeks.

According to Longini, there have
been no complaints about rejec-
tions, although the stations have
reserved the right to refuse mess-
ages on behalf of political candi-
dates and those dealing with coun-
ter-advertising against paid com-
mercial spots. They will also edit
in the case of infringements of
FCC regulations.

COM is now assisting partici-
pating stations by settling logisti-
cal problems and consulting with
interested citizen groups and in-
dividuals. - ‘

Recently, COM formed a coali-
tion with Create Incorporated
Pittsburgh Community for Media
Change in order to make similar
agreements with radio stations.
They were crucial in influencing a
unique agreement between the
new owners of WJAS and
black community.

According to Hanks. WJAS will
hire blacks for top positions and
carry free speech messages guar-
anteeing black interest 30 per
cent of the time and women an-
other 30 per cent.

McGovern, Visits Area

by JOHN CAPITMAN

"We share an earnest desire to
see a Democrat in the White
House. not because we want a dif-
ferent party label. but because we
want to change the course that
this country has taken." said
presidential hopeful Senator
George McGovern to the Pitts-
burgh municipal and Allegheny
County borough and ward officials
Wednesday morning.

The Senatorrwho was accom-

' panied by Senator Edward Kenne-

dy, made the address to local

Democratic Party leadership and

the press at the Hilton Hotel in
downtown Pittsburgh.

Kennedy said, introducing Mc-
Govern, that ‘.‘he is the candidate
most concerned with the prob-
lems of all the people, not just the
corporate special interests.” Mc-
Govern reitereated his position
on the Southeast Asian war, but
he stresses other issues, saying,
“The number one Democratic
priority is to set in motion those
programs and those projects that
will guarantee each person in this

. country, who can work, a decent

“T job.”

McGovern referred to the
Roosevelt years and the WPA. He
said that by instituting such pro-
grams. placing the full cost of
welfare under federal jurisdic-
tion. and standardization of‘ pay-
ment scales. we could greatly re-
duce welfare costs and the indig-

nities of the present system.

During the question and answer
period. one borough chairwomen
asked whether McGovern would
leave "the South Vietnames to the
mercy of the North.“ "I don‘t
think'it is our responsibility to
settle the basically political
struggle for the control of Sai-

.-‘~gygon.“ he replied.

F. Mitchell, vice chairwomen
from Harrison Township. ex-
pressed the general enthusiasm
of most of the Democratic regu-
lars present, saying. “That we
will have strong support for Me-
Govern and Schriver in our area.
from the working man and from

ers—they have a good chance of

Letters to the Editor  

Pitt Unfair to SDS

T To the Pitt News:

Last spring session, three Pitt

' students who were members of
. SDS were arrested on campus for
' putting up posters calling for ac-
“ tivity against Nixon’s increase of
‘ I the bombing in Vietnam. The pos-
ters called for a STRIKE, an end to

 _. university complicity with the war.
{and an end to ROTC which re-
 cruits officers for the war. We
% think that we were arrested be-
' cause of what these posters said

_‘ rather than because we were de- .

’ -facing Pittproperty which is the
‘ ‘*_reas_on Pitt gives.

' There are several reasons for
. our thinking this:

1) Pitt doesn’t have a habit of
‘lyarresting students for defacing
* University property. Last year
{some organization painted. huge
 yellow footprints on the side
i.walks all over campus — there
 was no hassle. Last year the dorms
3 were wrecked by students (brok-
 en glass, smashed lights, and re-
3-moved bannisters made the stairs
“positively unsafe. But did Pitt’
. ever contemplate grand jury in-
I dictments for the offenders in
» these cases? (Not that we think
_ they should have.) -Every inch of
the Pitt News office wall is
,__covered with grafitti. Surely the
-entire staff of the Pitt News should
be arrested, if that is to be the
I penalty for defacing Pitt proper-
-. ty.
I 2) Pitt has a habit of insisting
fl that students arrested on campus
" (even by City police) be tried
through campus rather than City‘
 judiciary. They have done this
._‘'even with felonies. In our case
,_ they actively insured that we were
 V indicted by the grand jury.
N 3) SDS itself had put posters
2 up for a year without being warn-
' ed not to. We had been warned
-{not to put up stickers in the Stud-
’ ent Union, and we stopped. The
posters were put up with laundry
T starch and were removable with
-J warm soapy water (and some vig-
"'or‘ous scraping). We had never
,5 ‘ used spray paint at Pitt. We resort-
' ed to posters partly because our
‘signs seemed to disappear from
' bulletin boards - even when stamp-
" ed.

. . 4) After arresting us officer
-Pendergast called several of his
superiors to find out what to do
with us. Everytime he talked to one
"of them he made sure to mention
that we were in SDS. That very
— night campus cops scouted out the
rest of the posters and removed
, many of them. Wouldn’t such mat-

ters normally be left to the jani-
tors (who usually get the hard
work end of this type thing). Un-
less the cops didn't want students
to see the posters. The University
was so uptight about the posters
that the commander of ROTC
even asked for special police to
guard ROTC the next night!

Now Gil the head of campus se-
curity says they'll give us a break
and drop the charges. The only
hitch is that it will cost us $75.00
apiece to be paid to the court to
get the charges nul proced. Some
favor! We think the university
should pay the cost—they start-
ed the whole thing. We would like
Gil, or whatever representative
Pitt chooses. to reply to this in the
Pitt News or in some other public
manner.

Double Disillusion

To the editor:

An unusually stormy interim be-
tween national political conven-
tions has finally ended. The time
traditionally set aside for secret
strategy sessions surprisingly per-
petrated a peevishly pugnacious
complection on the political puss
of our nation this year. The battle
scars show clearly that neither par-
ty has produced a candidate good
enough to unify American behind
her ideals.

Regardless of the outcome of
November's election national un-
ity will not be forthcoming in 1973.
Unity is not born of collective
political greed and selfishness. It
is the child of individual responsi-
bility and freedom.

-A few months ago America at-
tended a display of contrived free-
dom at the Democratic National
Convention. The surrepticiously
staged senario sang the smugly
supercilious strains of “big stick“
political power.,
cians played patriots. a struggle
strangely similar to a Cosa Nostra
coup d’ etat coagulated to clot
channels of remunerative reform
and direct the demise of the dis-
mantled Democratic Part_v. Yet;
far worse than similarity to un-
derworld operations was the con-
nivingly criminal connotation at-
tached to the avaricious acquisi-
tion of clandestine campaign
contributions by the Republicans.

“Heinous.Hypocrisy“ and "Frau-
dulent Freedom” have become
the watch words of the “New Po-
litics." Deny it or don’t, Democra-
tic foreign policies under “Lyberal
Lyndon Liability" have been too

sible Richard Reactionary." Speak-
ing of whom. there have never
been any so shrewd in the art of
political expediency as "Despot-
ic Dick Delusion“ and the wil_v
pullers of his elusive executive en-
tourage. Thus. while ".\li(-key
McGovern" has reproached the
reprobate Republicans. the GOP
has disparaged the desparate Dem-
ocrats —— both showing nefarious
neglect of the nations needs.
America needs a president with
personal. patriotic and political
ethic. Instead she is offered a
choice between hypocris_v and t_v—
ranny. Yes. America's tired tax-
payer has allowed the traffic tick-
et fixers to brew their beguiling
batch of bunk in City Hall long
enough to have intoxicated the
American conscience with its
perverse political potency. So
drunk with damnable degreda-
tion and degeneration that even
the past ten years of blood bath-

convinced the victimized voter
vassels that they have been had.

Keep . It Clean

Editor,

I would like to express my feel-
ings about the Custodial Depart-
ment at the University of Pitts-
burgh. To work for the University
has been a tremendous pleasure.
To do a good job it takes more than
the best equipment, the neatest_
of rooms, or the best boss. I think
that the basic unity between man
and his job is the development of

his strength to perform the most

difficult task. To develop in‘a
way that your own attitude issuch
that coming to work is a pleasure
and being at work is worth the
measure of what is expected of
you.

Being a custodian is a different
way of life. Knowing the mess they
make you have to clean up. Being
recognized asan asset, in a sense,
gives one a beautiful foundation
for a pleasurable evening being
at the bottom of the pole. Even
the strongest building needs a
strong foundati_on or it will crum-
ble to the ground. To come to
work knowing that very few peo-
ple care is a defeated course. To
walk in an office where someone
doesn’t have the courtesy to
place food in a receptacle. Such
as, potatoes chips, banana peel-
ings, breadcrust, pieces of cake,
etc. It is expected that a janitor is
there to clean up, but some peo-
ple take unnecessary measures to V
be extremely sloppy. That makes
the whole effort a thorn in the side.

I remember several instances
where in bathrooms there were
sanitary napkins in face bowls in-
stead of in a receptacle; ‘human
waste was wiped on walls. and
nose particles were wiped all over
a wall in a Professor's private bath-
room. in which I had to take a
scraper to get it off. I know that
sometimes things can't be helped.
but even the Government has slo-
gans. such as Help Keep America
Clean. So I suggest that a slogan
be used here at Pitt. Such as. Help
Make This University the Clean-
est Place in America. So that the
custodian can make this slogan
not just a slogan but a pure and
true fact. ‘

Ignorance Lib

By JOHN METCALFE
Lately I've received several communications from Harry Blandig.
in his crusade against the narrowness of written communications.

   

Harry is the local organizer of. and spokesman for. Ignorance Lib-
eration. Here on campus. their principal objective is the abolition
of the literacy requirement for graduation. Other objectives. though
not so vital. will be pursued vigorously. Among them is Blandigs cur-
rent campaign.

Ignorance Lib., and Mr. Blandig, are demanding that cassette re-
corders be made available to all members of the University community
at once. According to Blandig: “We must free ourselves from the tyr-
any of the mimeograph. Our message is not only for those who can
read and write . . . in fact, the whole strength of our movement is
among the illiterate.”

The basic structure of the university is elitist. Mr. Blandig claims.
despite such token "reforms" as the recent elimination of language
requirements and the required courses in English Composition.

“At first I supported these changes.“ Mr. Blandig droned. "be-
cause the brutal racist public school system had instilled respect
in me for the very concern with spelling and grammar they had used to
distort my mind.

"They had. in effect. made a reading machine of me . . .
out of me.

sorry.

"Now I realize that I've been a tool of these intellectual imperial-
ists. For a long time I‘ve traded the richness of the oral tradition for the
artificial lures of literature. Even if I wanted to. I could never make
such a big mistake again."

I interrupted him.

“You seem to express yourself very well in what you call an arti-
ficial form. How is it that you defend the preliterate tradition so much
in what is a dialect alien to your movement?”

"Ain‘t I already said I was corrupted by the System‘? Do I gotta
kill myself for you fascists? I_don't want none of my people to suffer
what I have." _

"I can see the justice of that. But what are your immediate objec-
tives. Not just yours. but those of Ig. Lib. as a whole. I mean. watcha
gettin‘ off on?" — , .

“We intend to restructure the entire educational establishment
through radical tactical actions. All who are not resolutely with us
must be counted as members of the opposing forces.

"Sheee . . . what I mean is, man, we really want those recorders . . .
and ain’t nobody goin’ to mess with us once we get our shit togeth-
er . . . you know . . . how come you writing all this down . . . this ain't
for you elitist intellectuals . . . getch’ ass outa here."

I had to leave for a previous appointment.

Black September
Strategy Backfires

By STEVELUBETSKY

The strategy of the Black September Arab guerrillas. who brutally '

murdered eleven Israelis at the Olympic games last week. backfired
when a shoot-out between the terrorists and police at the Munich
airport claimed the lives of the nine Israeli hostages they had intend-
ed to fly to Cairo '

Apparently. the terrorists‘ scheme in large part.involved testing
president Anwar Sadat of Egypt. who in July expelled all Soviet mili-
tary personel from his country. Had the nine hostages been taken to
Cairo, Sadat would have been expected to demonstrate that deport-

‘ ing the Soviet Union does not necessarily imply peace overtures to

Israel and execute the prisoners.

This would have put Mr. Sadat in a most precarious dilemma. On
the one hand, if he were to have put the hostages to death, he surely
would have invoked a retaliation from Israel upon himself. Unlike
Syria, which houses guerrilla bases whose terrorists have, for the most
part, reciprocated against recent Israeli attacks, Egypt, having no such
sanctuaries, herself would have had to administer the task of return-
ing the compliment. '

Without the support of the Kremlin behind him. Sadat‘s military
is too weak to sustain an Israeli reprisal. Responding to it would have
meant increased and more devastating blows. Inaction might have
enraged the terrorists. who represent potential for trouble to any
Arab regime.

If Sadat. on the other hand. had accepted the hostages and later
released them (averting damage from Israel). he would have gravely
embittered the Arab commandos. who might have accused him of
softening his stand on Israel. He could conceivably have been placed
alongside King Hussein atop their extermination list. It is likely that

tempers among Black September members had already been arousedg-A:
from prior attempts by Egypt to discourage them from conducting their '

mission. so as not to downplay the Arab cause.

The hostages, of course, never made it to Cairo. As tragic as was
their fate, Mr. Sadat could have been none the more relieved. All that
was required of him then was to continue the verbal support which his
regime has consistantly given to Arab guerrillas since he assumed pow-
er. Accordingly, he lived up to expectations, as the Cairo press. AL
AKHBAR, praised the terrorists who, it claimed, acted “courageously
and cautiously, killed the Israelis and fell martyrs.” '

Nonetheless. the aftermath of Munich_ is sheer embarrassment for
the Sadat Regime. World sympathy has been-overwhelmingl_v in fav-
or of Israel. while Egypt‘s bargaining position. which earlier might
have gained her assistance from other nations in pressuring Israel to
withdraw from the East Bank of Suez. has been fractured if not demol-
ished.

Sadat has thus escaped for the moment what could have spelled
disaster for his leadership. But the absence of Soviet aid coupled with
distrust from the West could leave him as a powerless ruler. And
those kind don't last very long in the Arab world. A .

“K With the departure of Jean
‘L Langlais from Pittsburgh this
past week. we now may take the
opportunity to reflec_t for a few
moments upon the basis of his
work. Such a reflection is espe-
cially advantageous at the present
time. not only because of his
Heinz Chapel appearance but also
because of this past Tuesdays
noon organ recital given by our

own University organist. Robert
S. Lord.

In his noon program. Lord as-
sembleda group of Langlais com-
positions. which in addition to
those of the composer's own re-

V". cital. gave listeners a rather good
idea of the French master‘s com-
positional techniques and artistic
inspirations.

What has been most readily ap-

parent in both recitals is the pre-
sence of Gregorian chant and ec-
. clesiastical modes as a basis for
inspiration and composition; cer-
tainly a surprisingly orthodox
foundation in contrast to the often
startling “finished product.”
(Need we recall how many of us
were literally “holding on to our
_,-""F§ats” during the Imploration No.
3 last Thursday?)

There is dissonance and ‘plen-
ty of it and it adds magnificently
to the grandeur of it all. especial-
ly at climactic moments. While
the composer evidently has in-
tended each composition of asa-
cred nature ad majoram gloriam
Dei, he has also conveyed the par-
adoxical problem: human frailty
always overcomes us before the
goal is finally reached. But this
hardly means that there is pessi-
mism throughout his work. there
is often optimism and outright

Langlais‘ faith in the unityof all
has perhaps been best expressed
in a fairly recent work. the Oecu—
menical Book (performed at the
Tuesday recital). Here. he has
drawn upon not only the chants of
the Roman liturgy but also upon
Lutheran chorale tunes as well.
And this is so indicative of what
Langlais has done and continues
to do; he continues to embrace
more and more of that which sur-
rounds him. namely the world it-
self. -

No matter what we examine in
his catalogue of works, we realize
that the “spirit” of the middle
ages is almost inseparable from

‘the character of his works. Take,

for instance, his Medieval Suite
(also performed this past Tues-
day). Despite the basis of the
work’s movements (everything

from Spanish to French chants)‘

we certainly should dare to say
that there is indeed something
relevant here, something which
speaks to us.‘ ‘The syncopated

some Reflections

rhythms of the Suite’s final move-
ment (entitled Acclamations)
have such an appealing dance-
like quality that many of us may
have found ourselveszdancing (at
least in our minds) following its
performance.

But what. the reader may be
asking himself. does this have to
do with me‘? If we feel that music
is a summing up of. among other
things. our joys. hopes. and as-
pirations (and I think most of us
do). then it has much to do with
those of us who listen with seri-
ous intent.

I felt this sense of hope and con-
fidence perhaps even more
strongly when Jean Langlais was
at the keyboard. and I think that
I am safe in assuming that many
of those present in the audience
that evening felt much the same
way. The work of genius inspires.
There is certainly little doubt
about that.

they allowed numerous easy touchdowns to eager Pitt oppon-

Michigan football star. Tom Har-

On one play in particular McAlis-
ter cleared three tackles at the

"McAlister is a great back and
Harmon gives them excellent
leadership from the quarterback

blew Nebraska ‘off the -line of

Nine Pitt pitchers easily combined to defeat a
young Steubenville College baseballisquad. 11-2.
~ Wednesday afternoon at Trees Field. The longlist
of pitchers began with senior Mike Fedoris. who
was touched for two runs in the first inning.

Andy Garrigan of Steubenville was the first
batter Fedoris faced and hit a line drive double to
left center. Freshman Mike Frey then sent left-
fielder Ron Bassett crashing into the fence in a vain
attempt to spear his hard smashing double. This
was followed by a line drive single from Rick Rich-
art’s bat with the result being. two runs. the only’

grounder hit by Pete Martorelli. The score stood
Steubenville leading 2-1 until the bottom of the third
and then the fireworks began.

Martorelli started things off when he walked
with one out. Dennis Toboz singled to rightfield with
Martorelli moving to third on the play. Denny Slain

Senior Al Sylanski pitched the next inning for

batter Al Cosi was thrown out at second on a strong
peg from Bassett in the leftfield corner.

The Pitt lead was then increased to five runs in

ard Work Pays OOH

by RON SIEGEL

"This Saturday’s football game is going to be
what the coaches call a hard-nose football game,“
_said veteran Panther linebacker George "Feather"
Feher. “UCLA is much more of a running team than
Florida State. We haven’t been tested yet with the
run.

The statistics bear out what Feher says. In last
week’s upset victory over number one ranked Ne-
braska, quarterback Mark Harmon passed only
eight times. “We’ll try to force them to pass.” Feh-

er added, "They’ll even try to run on third and long V

yardagef’

Feher. a senior from Aliquippa, will be start-
ing at linebacker tomorrow along with senior Gary
Patterson. Feher got his nickname. “Feather,“ due
to a misprint in The Polaris which was picked up on
by teammate Bill Mercer. He became a starter last
season when injuries sidelined Ralph Cindrich.

He started against Florida State and played one
of his best games ever. He recov_ered one FSU fum-
ble, picked off a Gary Huff pass, and almost turn-
ed the game with another interception.

Huff threw a pass which set Feher up with a

' ‘clear path to the end zone, or at least the 50-yard

line, but Feher couldn’t hold on to it.

"He must not have seen me,” lamented Feher.‘

‘fl didn’t expect him to throw it, it came as a com-

eplete shock. I had already intercepted one pass that
game, and the next thing I knew I‘heard the groans
of the fans. ,

“We won’t be uncomfortable with UCLA’s
Wishbone,” he added, “We played against our own
Wishbone all spring and at Johnstown, so we’ll
know what to expect. Besides, the Wishbone is new
to them (UCLA) too.”

Feher feels that last year’s team had "better

 

 

material than this year’s squad. but our attitude is
vastly improved. If we could have made the two
interceptions we. almost missed." he added. "we
could have won that first game."

Feher refused to make any predictions on to-
morrow’s game. “I don’t make predictions." he
emphasized, “I just go out and do the best I can."

Linebacker coach Bill Quinter
has been impressed with the
way all of his charges have been
working. They have a great at-
titude, they’re working real ‘
hard to master the fundamen-
tals,” he noted, “and you saw
how it payed off for Feher.” ’ V

While pleased with the line
backer’s attitude, Quinter was ..
not satisfied with last week‘s FEHER
game. “The boys keep showing constant improve-
merit.” he admitted. “but I’m never satisfied if we
don‘twin.“ -

The Panther defense will once again use the
five-two defense in an attempt to cut off the Bruin
running game, and Quinter‘s linebackers should be
a lot fresher, as five will be used throughout the
game, including Bill Mercer. who saw little action
against FSU.
