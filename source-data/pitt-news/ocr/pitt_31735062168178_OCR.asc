Ask This Man.")

Pitt Stadium is getting new col-_

ors. but the loyal fans of the Blue
and Gold shouldn‘t be too alarm-
ed. The red and green that are be-
ing added to the Stadium are a
part of improving the facility.

Athletic Director Casimir Myslin-
ski announced that_ construction
work on the installation of a bright

green’ AstroTurf football ‘field sur-'

rounded by a burnt red Tartan
track will begin today. The work
should be completed by Aug. 15.

Senator Efdmund Muskie of
Maine raised the specter of a di-
vided America in an address
Thursday night at the William
Penn Hotel. ‘

As listeners wondered whether
the lanky Democrat at the podi-
um was a future President, Mus-
kie adumbrated a theme which

could win him his party’s nomina- ‘

tion for President in 1972. L

' "Weve got to reach out for an
open society.,'.' the former candi-
date for Vice-President told a

crowd of Democratic stalwarts at ~

their annual Jefferson Day Din-
nets "To most Americ_a_ns. in their

- secret hearts. the best kind of

country is an open one which ac-
cepts tis all."

Muskie sounded very much like.

a man in search of Democratic
backing. After paying almost cloy—
mg tributes’ to such Democratic
saints as the late Governor David
L. Lawrence and Committeewom-
an Emma Guffey Miller. he invok-

ed the name of John F. Kennedy A

and quoted the late President:
We have learned that tolerance
and coopera”lion are the ways to

. true national strength."

The Maine Senator seemed to
agree. though. that the lesson has
not been learned:

“There is a great feeling of"

fear and insecurity which has
swept America,” he observed.
“Americans doubt that other
Americans, especially those who

are different," have their well-be-.

Pitt basketball was also giv-
en some new life when Coach ‘Buzz
Ridl announced his latest recruit
at the luncheon. The addition.
Braddock High School's Bill
Knight. was one of the most want-
ed roundballers in the nation. tsee
story on page six. l

Monsanto Company of St. Louis
will lay the artificial gridiron,
while their opposition in the bid-
ding for that job, 3-M of Minnea-
polis, will build the track.

Mylinski would not go into great
detail in explaining his choice of
AstroTurf over Tartan for the
football area. but he did mention
"there‘s a difference in terms of
resiliency. but it's slight. The
main problem is cost. Tartan was
a little more expensive than As-
tro."

Myslinski didn't reveal the to-
tal cost of the remodelinggeither.
He labeled the cost of _the Astro
surface at $300.000-plus.

Such an expenditure is obvious-
ly expected to bring some com-
plaints from people who are well-
informed on the financial status
of the University. But Myslinski
feels that he can rationalize the
spending.

"If tuition is increased—and I
don’t know that it will be—I don't
want people saying that we should
have used this money on some-
thing else." he said. "You just

"We’ve Got to Reach Out for an Open. Society”

Muskie Urges Unity 

Muskie attributed the nation's_
predicament not so much to its po-
litical leadeixs or social system as
to its people. "In the final analy-
sis." he argued. "our society will
work only if there are bonds of
confidence among our citizens."

Discerning a scarcity of "toler-
ance. understanding. compassion. -
and the willingness to listen"
among Americans. Muskie de- '

plored the “deterioration" of the .

bonds he considers so important.
"Unless we have them." he main-
tained. pausing dramatically. “we
liaventgot a country."

The Senator was clearly dis-
turbed by the state of the union.
“I don’t recall a time,”.he stress-
ed, “when it was more important
to bring people together.” i

In an attempt to explain why
some resort to violence. Muskie
noted that "many Americans are“
disillusioned with our system of
government: they feel. rightly or"
wrongly. that politics has become
a game." '

 
      
       
    
      
           

  

     
          
          
      
      

   
  
  
 
  

éandi that‘s one whic

can't realize the benefits you can
get from artificial turf.

"The fact that artificial turf is
desirable for intercollegiate foot-
ball is a plus factor. but only a
small one. because varsity loot-
ball games will comprise prob-
ably less than one per cent of the
use of the field."

The Stadium will be openedlfor
intramural and recreational use
as well as for some physical ed-
ucation classes. The soccer team
will also practice on the turf and
play some of their games there.

"We plan to makevevery possi-
ble use of the Stadium that we
can." Myslinskisaid. “The invest-
ment in artificial turf gives us

. land utilization equivalent to a.
piece of property ‘many times the

existing dimensions of the Stadi-
um playing field.“

The track area is similar to the
Tartan track that is in Fitzgerald
Field House. It will be a 440-yard
oval with six lanes. Dean Billick.
Pitt Sports Information Director.
called it “one of the best in the ._

' country" and said that the Ath-

~letic Department is hoping to ob-
tain major track meets. such as

_ the Eastern Championships tthe
‘lC4AsI. -'

Referring to - financial advan-
tages of the surfaces, Myslinski
-argued that the Turf will last quite
awhile, removing the annual cost ’

 

He asserted that "confrontation
has become the watchword of the
day" because many are convinced

that there is no institutional way
tor them to get change."

Muskie warned. however. that
the byproducts of confrontation
must be kept in mind. Citing the
Kent State slayings, he termed
them "symbolic of what can hap- '
pen to our country and our society
if we don't appreciate the conse-
quences of violence."

Expressing support for the
“surge of concern” which appear-
ed on campuses across the nation
in the wake of President .Nixon’s
Cambodia venture and the Kent-
State incident, Muskie said he
hoped it would prove to be ‘_‘a mar-
athon and not a 100-yard dash.”_'

The, Maine Democrat issued a
caveat. "I understand.“ he stated.
“that when a society reaches the
present state of ferment. there is
a temptation to build walls. to keep
those who are different or unplea-
sant outside." But this. he de-
clared. would bring only "a tem-
poiary‘ security." _

Muskie went on to criticize the
Republican Party‘s "southern
strategy" and its most important
proponent. Richard Nixon. "It is
the responsibility of a leader to
heal divisions. not to deepen
them." he declaimed.

Concluding. Muskie issued an
appeal for unit_v which could be
the Democratic Party's campaign
cry in two years: "Only one kind
of party deserves to win in 1972

people guarantee replacement of
their grass for a.5-7 year period.
After that, they have other types
for preparing
smaller damages. .

Myslinki noted. however. "They
don't know how long it lasts. No
one has had it long enough."

About 40 other colleges in the
nation have gone to the artificial
surface. including Panther rival
West Virginia. And the Monsanto
and 3-Ms Companies—along with a
few other rivals in their business

and more schools and profession-

LRDC Aims to
  stymie    

- by LEE TERKEL

The Learning Research and De-
velopment Center (LRDC) set
aside Friday as a day of discus-
sion and politicalaction. The cen-
ter collectively ‘expressed its dis-
approval of President Nixon's de-
cision to move troops into Cam-

bodia and of the killings at Kent"

State. Jackson "State and Augusta,

_ (ja-. I

In the morning, about 30 people.
most of them LRDC researchers,
participated in what was essen-
tially a soul-searching session.
They .acknowledge that a substan-
tial amount of research in the field
of learning psychology is spon-
sored by the military. -

-For example: in the last war. it

was estimated that 25 percent of

the soldiers fired their guns in
combat. Psychologists put their
‘heads together, and -developed
mind manipulating techniques
that increased the percentage to’
what is presently is in Vietnam—'
75 percent.

The assembled scientists

agreed that it is their_responsibil-

ity to scrutinize a research pro-

, ject before undertaking it to de-

Itlwas brought out that newly

ceptible to manipulative forces.

The Time is Short,_  
The Time Is Now.”

by KIRKE BEARD

(Editor's Note: The writer describes himself as a member of the “older gener-
tion." He is a private citizen from Los Angeles, California, who feels the need to
mm.unicate with the younger generation. He has donated his own modest” finan-
es and efforts to communicating some of his ideas and solutions about our world
,ay. His columns will appear from time to time in the Pitt News. We publish his
eclaration of Man today in place of our regular column or editorial. A petition
his request will be available in the Pitt News Office for all those who would
ke. to sign it. Mr. Beard’s creed and reason for writing is, “Anyone open to a dia-
ogue with others on what is just, acts in the service of man.” »

If ‘I "Will "the majority of thinking people. "the concerned". renounce the killing of
_uma'n beings and the despoiling of earth’s natural resources‘?

M Will you, in your community, and among those you know in the appropriate or-
ganizations and institutions, do what you can to reproduce this Declaration,‘cir-
ciilate petitions on its behalf, and forward signed petitions to leaders in all walks
of life?

 Eighty some million Americans vote every two years on national issues. Be-
tween now and other next national elections, the signatures of an unsilent major-
ity of fifty or sixty millionvcould be a forceful persuader among leaders shaping
basic policies.

People are often ahead of their officials in sensing the need for fundamental

‘that time grows short for men to reason togerher . '.“if any deep value is to come
from the shock of My Lai, it will‘ come with a renewed examination of war as a

world . . . these pitiful peasants cry from the grave for men to reason together.”

ove so stout a conservative as Mr. Kilpatrick to words such as these. he finds him-
self allied in purpose with the Coretta Kings, the Robert ’Kennedys, theulvlahatma

dwindling world’  _

In short, with the concerned, who believe the time is short. and the time is
now —— on behalf of peace and sanity on our planet, to let all leaders know the peo-
les own deepest desires for a true family of man. '

Campus Strike Newsl

Already. 286 colleges and universities have decided to continue their strikes
until the end of the academic term. and many others of the 450 schools that struck
last week are considering extending their boycott on businesilas usual. '

The strike has spread to high schools. 167 high schools are on strike with 

other 30 voting on strike action. according to the Brandeis University strike infor-
mation center.

National strike conferences are being held at. and possibly NSU. A summer
strike planning conference is scheduled for May 29 at Oberlin or Antioch or
St. Louis. (For more information call 302-730-9175.

Anti-war demonstrations and GI teach-ins are planned for 45 military bases on
Armed Forces Day May 16. and military authorities are braced for possible con-
frontations. " -

Faculty and administration support for strikes continues to grow on some cam—
puses. At the University of Colorado. the faculty has voted almost unanimously to
cancel the rest of the academic term and keep the University open for strike acti-
vities. At the University of California at Irvine. the administration has announced
students can drop present courses and receive credit for strike and anti-war work
through free university courses.

Violence continues on some campuses. including at the University of South
Carolina which had never experienced campus unrest before last week. 3000 stu-
dents "demonstrated and 200 students broke into the_University treasurer’s offices

T‘eI1 Students Query  

(Editor's note: The following. _article was written and researched by Pitt
undergraduates, Kathy Lovell, Mike Haley, John Cavaluchy, Samuel Conte Nick
Gervase, Richard Cohen, Ray Williams, Janie Woo, Arnie Steinberg, and Susan
Jaditz.) "

Dear Editor,

As a student at the University of Pittsburgh, I recently became aware of rum-
ors concerning the poor choice of spending priorities established by Chancellor
Wesley W. Posvar and the University.

In the past. people have blamed Harrisburg for Pitt's financial woes. How-

ever. it has become apparentto me that the University should share a large part of

the blame and responsibility for its own financial‘ dilemma.

On May 7. I went to see Mr. Montgomery, the. Director of the University‘s Fin-
ances. in an effort to find out where my money was going with respect to what
I heard about the Chancellor and the University. .

Mr. Montgomery was frank and kind enough to answer my questions. He told
me that for the benefit of'the Chancellor. the University:

1» purchasing a $10,000 Cadillac last fall: -
2i has ‘maintained two large homes cared for by a sizeable staff of servants:

3: helped finance a trip to Amsterterdam made in the fall. and with the aid
of the British government and the Ford Foundation. funded an around-the-world
tour for the Chancellor this last winter which included an African safari and a
stop-over in Saigon :- 1 ‘ '

4» and pays..the Chancellor a‘ salary ofebetween $35.000 and $65,000 a year
which Mr. Montgomery _re_vealed to me as comparable to the salaries of other col-
lege presidents. ' ‘

The-Chancellor more recently has ‘hired a consultant at University expense

  ChaIicello1"s Spending

to estimate the cost of moving his offices to the _12th floor of the Cathedral of

Learning.
The cost came to $250.000.

A Mr. Montgomery said a move of this sort has now been cancelledibecause of
- the cost. but is still seen as an eventual necessity.

By talking with other people and from my own experience, I also learned that
the University: '

maintains a large administrative bureaucracy characterized by many_people
as a group of chronic "buck-passers." which includes the Universityslegal coun-
sel who is not even a member of the Pennsylvania Bar Association; has cut the
funds for the entire teaching assistant program in half; and has threatened in April
to fire teaching assistants. blaming the financial crisis for the austerity.

lntreference to these issues. it is understandable that the Chancellor and the
Pitt administration be allotted certain monies for their benefit and use; however.
qitrappears these funds have not been soundly allocated. Why were many_of these
unnecessary expenditures made during what was characterized as Pitt's financial
crisis‘? Why is there a move to fire teaching assistants when $10,000 spent on a
new University Cadillac could finance four of their salaries for a year?

Further ineffective use of funds can be seen by examining the University bud-
‘get. According to the 1969-70 budget. less than 1/3 (31.8 percent) of the nearly
$100 million in expenditures went toward the instruction of over 25.000 undergra-
duate and graduate students. In the 1968-69 budget. 32.8 percent went toward
heading of "other educational expenses." I feel that some of these expenses. how-
ever. are hardly educational because their include the questionable’ expenditures
already mentioned. ~ . I '

Now Chancellor Posvar is demanding Harrisburg pay $45.3 million of Pitts
budget /— up $8 million from Gov. Shafer's recommendations. Posvar contends the
I. extra money is needed to educate the youth of Pennsylvania. Why then does only
1 3 of Pitt's money go to instruction‘? Why. too. are teaching assistants going to be
fired‘? Why is the Chancellornow paying $5-10.000 to buy new draperies for the
Babcock room on the 40th floor of the Cathedral‘? He claims that the students will
have to pay $40 more a year if the state does not contribute more. In the 1968-69
budget. the students‘ tuitions and state supplements paid for instruction costs. Why
should students pay for rising costs incurred by the University for maintenance and ‘

iiheVadministration‘?..But_ in ‘the end it ‘will probably be the students and. ‘taxpayers .-

Not Apathy,
But Opinion

(Editor's Note: The following is in
response to Bob Ging’s article of
May 12, 1970.)

Editor. The Pitt News:

Well. you solicited my opinion
and you are going to get it.

I am sick of people accusing me

 apathy.

Has it ever occurred to you that
what you call apathy may in real-
itybe the fact that I disagree with
what you are doing and the way
you are doing it.

Therefore. I refuse to become a
_part of it.

That is not apathy.

It is taking a stand which is dif-
ierent from yours. and it is «at
the moment» my right to do so.

_ But you wouldn't think so to read
the Strike News—t0 wit—-"Pitts-
burgh: 300 city high school stu-
dents took over the Board of Ed-
ucation building demanding that
the superintendent make a state-

_7’Qgnt condemning the Cambodian
invasion.” ' ' _

 

Everyone is making demands
these days, but they get up tight
when demands are made on them!

I am also sick of people blast-
ing Nixon on the idiotic assump-
tion that he doesn't care about is
going on. - '

There is an Indian proverb that
states that before we condemn a
man we should walk a mile in his
moccasins. _

1 am not knocking our right-
indeed. dut_\‘~—to criticize what we
ieel is wrong.

1 am knocking the fact that peo-
ple have chosen Nixon as their
scapegoat and attached every-
thing evil to him—-which is sim-
pleminded to say the least.

For all our supposed education,
we still tend to see in black and
white. It's the age old story of
simple answers to complex issues. .

I see from the article written
by Frank Donatelli that there are
others who feel as I do——let's
make more of our views known.

The installation which begins to-
morrow seemsllike a great idea to a
man up at Trees Hall who is unknown
to many of the Panther football fol-
lowers. And he would ‘be the person
to convince someone of the need for
Astro Turf. That man, -Leo Bemis, is
head soccer coach at Pitt and also di-
rectsu the University’s Intramural
Department; ’ ' '

~

Myslinski _'feels- that ‘most of the
benefits"fro'm‘.the turf will be realiz-
ed through an} increased ' intramural
and - recreational program. Bemis
will be able to ‘keep a tight schedule
of his intramural events‘ (‘not worry-
ing as much about inclement weath-
er), probably resulting ingthe expan-
sion of the program. ’Astro Turf could
also be a lure to students whowould

‘enter an event just_ to seewhat the _

surface is like.

Bemis could gain more from the

. fake grass as a soccer coach, though.

"We will definitely play-soccer on
the field,” Myslinski says, and those
words must be sweet“-music to Be-
mis’ ears. ” -

The soccer teams have struggled J

through the last few seasons and of-
ten during that time Bemis has com-

year the hooters practiced at Trees
Field, a very squeezed-in area. But
that was an improvement on ‘the field

waded? Ask This Mrtrt

_plained about poor facilities. Last.

of the year before, Kenard Field, an’.

unkept grounds located ‘in the mid-
dle of the Terrace Village projects.
Bemis had to send his players to con-

-struct temporary goals before the

practices. . - . .
Now. the soccermen willynhave two

decent playing -and (practice fields.-
Their regular practice grounds will

be the All-Purpose‘ Fields, where the

I

home soccer games were played last

fall. And when Carl DePasqua wants‘,

his football players to leave, their.
artificial turf for scrimmaging on
the real grass before away games
Bemis will take the booters to the
Stadium.

. This plan- should ‘work out well
since both the "football and soccer’

teams will pla-y on each of the sur-
face-types during their fall. scheclk,-.5,

dayhe could use artificial turf a cou-
