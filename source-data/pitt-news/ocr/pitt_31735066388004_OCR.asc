of the Student Judicial System, a "

can think logically, because “not
all of the cases are cut and dried.
They really need to sift through
the material.” "

Students who have a complaint
filed against_ them must see Dr.
Gisler before any action is taken.
They then have the opportunity
to plead guilty to their charge. If
they don't, then the complaint is
taken to a hearing. The accused
has the choice of meeting in front
of the board or facing an
administrative hearing, which
would be presided over by a

"neutral administrator who is

unfamiliar with the parties
involved. '

, If the student decides to» go in
front of the Judicial Board, he or
she: faces two prosecuting

advocates who will represent the .

university. These people are third-
year law students, randomly

, picked from all interested parties.

Students can represent themselves
or have their own attorney

Judicial Board serves as Pitt jury

represent them against the
university.

A student violating any rule in
the Student Code of Conduct is

“subject to these hearings. Dr.

Gisler will be present at these
hearings, but she notes, “I’m the
impartial moderator, not the jury; ”

If the board finds the accused
guilty as charged, it can inflict a
variety of punishments against
the student. Minor offenses can
result in a disciplinary warning or
reprimand, while more serious
actions can bring a partial or
even total suspension from the
university.

If a student commits a
misdemeanor or felony while on
campus, that person is subject to
dual proceedings by both the
campus and the city.

Dr. Gisler says, “lt’s been my
experience that employers look
at a student’s activities in college

. as well as their record.” She notes

Dollars but no sense

Exactlywhat is going to be done with the money in the
reserve fund? A ’

This question has been addressed more times than can
be counted in the past, and yet no reasonable answer has

, materialized.

The newest idea being kicked around is to limit the

0» amount of money that can be ‘held in the reserve fund to

$50,000. However, since there is currently over $72,000 in
the fund, the main question is this: What happens to the
$22,000 in excess of the new ‘ceiling’ that is already in the
account? ' I I g

The answer: itstays in the reserve fund, where it has
been all along. _ -

There doesn’t seem to A be a purpose for leaving the
money in the fund, except that perhaps SGB Allocations
Committee Chair Gil Borok thinks that, this rhetorical
move will silence the "students who want to see their
money spent on something other than ugly sculptures
and wood benches. . ‘ S V . ‘

The reserve fund was set up in case of a budget deficit
and has been replenished each year with money left over
from student groups. The studentsjhave donated this
money, and the students should at least be able to see
what their money has bought before they graduate;

Back in May, Borok suggested that the money could be
spent on a special speaker, such as Ronald Reaganor
johnny Carson. As of this date,» neither of the two public
personalities have so much as set foot on campus, nor has
anything else been done with this” money.

The current suggestion for the $22,000 is to allow it to

stagnate while we wait for something to use the money
for to emerge. Considering the fact that nothing has been
purchased in the two years since the neon sculpture was
so thriftily acquired, the wait may be a long one.

And once this money has finally been spent, any
amount exceeding $50,000 in the future will be placed in
a, general fund. Simply stated, it will be unused until the
Board sees fit to spend it. ’

We ask the SGB to bear in mind the source of the money
when making their bureaucratic decision. Spend the
money in the reserve fund onrsomething that will benefit
the students; you have been chosen as the caretakers of
that money by your peers. Their best interest, not that of
the Board, should be kept in mind.

‘As I climbed the worn stone
steps to the doors of the Carnegie
Library, I happened to glance up
and see the words “Free to the
People” carved in stone above
the doors. I pondered those words
and thought that they would be
more accurate if they read “Free
to Most of the People” or “Free to

_ Some of the People Some of the

Time.” _
You are probably wondering
what I mean by the above state-

 ment, and to illustrate my pointl

will have to tell you a little story.
One day in rnid-August, a friend

of mine from North Huntingdon,
» was paying me a visit. Being that

it is the‘ nicest place in the area,
he and I traveled. to Schenley
Park to toss frisbees and just walk
around the park talking about
everything from the ‘events in
China to why anyone would want
to jog in Oakland this time of
year. c

As evening approached, we
found ourselves on top of Flag-
staff Hill just in time to catch a
most awe-inspiring sunset. As we

settled ourselves down in a per-

fect position to see the entire

‘panorama, my friend noticed

whathe referred to as a “hippie-
looking dude” sitting near us with

his dog — also checking out the

incredible display of colors that
Mother Nature had provided us.
We decided to approach this man
and strike up a conversation.

As we approached we noticed
that his attire was rather ‘be-
draggled, and he did notseem to
have bathed recently. He eyed us
rather suspiciously as we sat
nearby. The three of us struck up
a conversation as the sun sank
slowly behind the buildings of
Oakland.

Your propaganda continues
with a call for a “substantial

believe the criminal bent on

A My friend asked him why he

Carnegie is not ‘Free to the People‘

We learned that this man was
homeless and often came to this
particular spot to watch the sun-
set. We agreed with him as he
lamented the state of the hill with
trash strewn everywhere. I mar-
velled that such a seemingly in-
telligent man could end up in his
predicament. I did not bother to

' ask him how he got to be in such

a state. I didn’t think it mattered.

some day would like to return.

 

doesn’t go back and finish his
education. He responded that he
could not afford it. To this my
friend told him that if he really
wanted to, he could educate
himself. After all anybody can go

to the library and get their fill of ‘

knowledge and not pay a single
cent.

“Ha!” was his reply as he went

on to explain that they do not let
“burns” in, the Carnegie Library.
Apparently he tried to go into the
library and was promptly shown
the door. Now they will not even
let him hang out in front of the
library and converse with pas-
sers-by. I guess you can never be
too safe when subversive bums
/are spreading their anti—library
views as they are prone to do.
That is what led me to the
conclusion that I put forth in the
first paragraph. However, I do
not intend to use this column to
incite a mob to storm the doors of
the Carnegie and lynch the li-
brary ladies. Instead I am asking

for years and we still have armed
hoods prowling our streets. l...]

, “The right to live is much more

rights than to live oppressed and

the question, “Why do people
feel that it is so necessary’ to be

Is it,b'ecause homeless people

then why aren’t people hassling
Ronald Reagan? He is unem-
ployed. Could it be because their
clothes are not very nice? I do not
exactly have a designer ward-
robe, but they still let me in the

It just seems that people are ..

I too. wrapped up in their own

little worlds to care about any-

are in a public place with people;
around I hardly think that any-
one is going to kill you.
Chances are that he is just a
regular person that happens to
be down on his luck at the time.
Everyone does not have a rosy
life where opportunity hits him

For The Pitt News

Hoping to stimulate
participation in official student
activities, the Office of Student
Activitieshas issued a list of 58
decertiﬁed and inactive groups.

According to Terry Milani,
associate director of student
activities, this list is provided “in

hope that some of these groups

are active, but have just not re-
applied for official certiﬁcation.
Our goal is to promote extra-
curricular student activities
through certiﬁed groups."

Group inactivity does not result
from university decisions but from
the failure of these groups to
apply for certification by the
March 1 deadline. Lisa Mitchell of
Student Activities said, “The
university does not discrirriinate
when certifying groups. These
groups_have failed to apply for
certification for reasons known
only in the group itself.”

One problem shared by several

groups is a lack of organization.

Dr. Medick Capirmio, adviser to A

the Ski Racing Club, said, “former
members have graduated, and I
don’t know who to talk to about
reorganizing the group.” The
adviser to the Students For Life
group, Vincent P. Costa, said he
“is interested in being recertified,
but disorganization within the
group has prevented this.” Costa
added that his group “hasn’t had
any difficulties with the university
in the past.”

Some group members lose
interest or simply graduate
without leaving much of a group
behind. A former member of the

University Christian Outreach, ‘

Steve Pepmeyer, said that the
UCO, which is officially certified,
has succeeded because of intense
recruitment of freshmen.
Pepmeyer says that the other
Christian groups ‘ “must

_ concentrate on freshmen, or their

groups will grow old.”

Defensive line overpowers Syracuse attack A

Double-defense plan
successful stopping
‘option’ Orangemen

By Ed Kuznik
Staff Writer

It was the -football equivalent

to Ali-Frazier or Hagler-Leonard. ,

Saturday evening’s game

between Pitt and Syracuse was *

hyped bylocal media as a game
that had to be won in the trenches.
It was a matchup speciﬁcally
between the Syracuse vaunted
offensive line, who some
considered to be the best in the
country going into this past
weekend's action, against a Pitt
defensive line oozing with depth
and quality players.

In other words, [there would
be] a pure knock—down, drag-
out brawl in which the winner
would likely be the last one

‘ standing. And it would definitely

be a heavyweight encounter, as
the average Orange offensive
lineman stands 6-foot—3 inches”

tall and weighs 283 pounds, while ,

Pitt’s ‘big boys stand about 6
foot’-4 inches and tips the scales
at 269 pounds.

Fight prognosticators would

have predicted a split decision,

but what occurred instead was a
decisive technical knockout for
Pitt’s first line of defense.

Pitt defenders riddled Orange
quarterback Bill Scharr for eight
sacks, seven by the defensive
line, and did nothing short of
stuff what was thought to be a
solid option attack guided by
sixth-year head coach Dick

McPherson.

“Syracuse came in for a
[nationally televised] game and
they were supposed to have the
No. 1 offensive line in the
country,” 6-foot-5 inches, 270-
pound Pitt defensive tackle Marc
Spindler said. “We were supposed
to be the No. 4 defense.

“What it came down to is we
went out and just played hard
every single play.”

Syracuse came into the game
averaging 168.5 yards rushing
per contest, but when all was
over the Orangemen were given
credit for 19 yards on 31 carries.

Although 65~yards were taken
away by sacks statistically, it soon
became 9' apparent that Syracuse
could not win the contest by
rushing the football or even using
the option attack. _

I As the final score indicated,
Scharr did his share of big-play
damage to keep his team in the
game, but in the end itiwas not
nearly enough to halt the
onslaught of blue—and-gold that

he saw in his face for the majority A -

of the night.“ . a

“They (Syracuse) are a good

football team, and they run the

option very well,” Panther
defensive line coach Frank d’
Alonzo said. “They executed
well, but it was one of those-
nights where our guys were
playing well on defense and
swarmed.”

“We wanted to shut down all 9

their second touchdown.

‘phases of the option,” freshman

Pitt defensive end Keith Hamilton
(6-foot-7 inches, 275 pounds)

"said. “I think we accomplished -

that. That was our main goal and
after that we just went with

T whatever they handed to us.” ‘

Because the Panthers have

_ eight defensive line men who have

started at one time or another in
their college careers, Pitt head
coach Mike Gottfried has installed
a “I” and “I-A”« defensive
alignment, which basically me ans
that the quartet of Richard Allen,
Jeff Esters, T om Sims and Mark
Gunn may come in to relieve

Headlines from the sidelines...

Here are some tidbits from
Saturday night’s game that you
probably missed if you were in
the unruly mass that is the student
section: ‘

0 Five freshmen looked very
impressive in Saturday’s game:
RB Derrick Lewis, WR Olanda
T ruitt, DE Keith Hamilton, C Chris
Sestili‘ and, of course, QB Alex
Van Pelt. 9

0 Speaking of Van Pelt, his
play fakes are as deceptive as

Boomer Esiason’s and his passes.

are reminiscent of Joe Montana’s.

9' Both of these NFL quarterbacks

led their respective teams to_ last
year’s Super Bowl, and perhaps,
with Van Pelt’s guidance, Pitt can
reach the college version of the
Promised Land. Van Pelt’s second
.quarter statistics were 13 of 14 for
171 yards with his only

-‘ incompletion coming with four

seconds left in the quarter, and it
was thrown to stop the clock. As
fate would have it, _Va_n Pelt

actually completed the 14th pass
to a ball boy on the Syracuse
sidelines. At the end of ESPN?s

Soccer team evens record at 3-3 after G’town win

By Sean Hellman
Staff Writer

The Pitt soccer team is showing
symptoms of problems. that
plagued the team last year, namely
the inability to ﬁnish their plays
by putting the ball in the net.

The Panthers dropped their
record to 3-3 with losses to West

’ Virginia and Georgetown last

week.

On Wednesday the Panthers
met a Mountaineer squad which
Pitt coach Joe Luxbacher called,
“a good team with tremendous
speed.”

WVU came into the game with
a 3-1 record giving up only one
goal in their first four‘ games.

Liberty University defeated WVU ‘

1-0. I
Luxbacher tried to neutralize
W V U 's speed advantage by

.making quick substitutions to‘
' keep fresh players on the field.

The game was wide open from
the start with each team getting
breath-taking chances. ‘

With 16 minutes left in the first
half the Panthers had’ a chance to
jump ahead of the Mountaineers.

The Panthers had a set play at
the top of the WVU penalty area.

« Junior co-captian Mike Blatz,

touched a pass to sweeper Heinz
Pak for a leftfooted rocket. The
shot was saved- by the WVU
keeper. The rebound got by the
keeper and ﬂirted with the lip of
the goal, only to be kicked out by

said Luxbacher.

The play was the perfect
example of Pitt’s scoring
frustrations last week. .

“We have to knock in our
chances,” said Luxbacher. “They
put theirs in. If we get that goal
it changes the complexion of the
game.”

The game went WVU’s way
with 25 minutes to play.

WVU defender Jeff Worst
dribbled through the midfield.
He spotted Tony Henson open in
the right corner. Henson dribbled
in deep, cut toward the Panther
goal and dished off to WVU’s
leading scorer, John Keating, who
beat Panther defenders to the
ball. Keating set his foot on _a
picture perfect pass from six yards
in front of the goal.

The Mountaineers took a 2-0
lead with nine minutes to play
when Henson took a shot from

‘ eighteen yards that beat Panther

keeper Jay Kapusta to the far
post.’ i , . ’ .

“We played well,” said Blatz.
“They played a good game. They
had two good goals. We gave a
good effort, we didnft quit."

Blatz also noted that Kapusta
played a good game. A

Kapusta was able to stop many
of WVU’s crossing passes toward
the front of the goal, however,
the Panthers seemed to wear out
in the end.

The Panthers travelled to a ’

soggy Nichols field in Sewickley,
Pa. on, Saturday, losing their third

 

Ia defender. straight game, 3-1 against

  Notes

Georgetown returned ‘nine
players from last year’s team
which was in the Big East playoffs.
They lost to soccer power
American University by a score
of 2-1 earlier in the season.

The weather was a factor in
this game. The player’s spikes
resembled skates with the mud
they collected. Each team looked
to capitalize on the other’s slips.

The Panthers scored a ﬂuke
goal, theironly goal of the week,
in the first half. '

J. R. Perdue won the ball off a
Hoya midfielder, dribbled about
30 yards down the middle of the
field and found Blatz open on the
left side. With his back to the
goal, Blatz made a beautiful move
to fake out two defenders and
turn to the goal. B1atz’s shot hit a
defender, bounced high in the

air, and fell in the goal behind an
off balance Bryan Gowdy,
Georgetown’s keeper.

Georgetown was able to answer
back for two goals before halftime.
Both goals came on rebounds of
initial shots.

Georgetown’s Tom Dillow took
a shot from inside the penalty
area which was blocked by a
crowd of players. The rebound
came to Hoya John Cronin who
put the ball away. i

The go—ahead goal was scored
by Dillow after Jay Kapusta got a
hand on Dom Paddack’s shot.

Kapusta was outstanding in the ’

net despite allowing three goals.
He stopped numerous one—on-
one opportunities where Hoya
forwards were able to slip past
Panther defenders. -

“We were too wreckless on

defense,” said Luxbacher.
Georgetown scored to put the
game away with 13 minutes
remaining.
Although both of last week’s

, opponents were probably better

than this Panther team, the losses
were still disappointing. The
Panthers felt WVU and
Georgetown were beatable.
The Panther’s have beenhurt
by injuries Junior defender Scott
McCurry is out for the season
with a broken cheek bone. He
sustained the injury in the first
game of the‘ season against

Slippery Rock.

Co-captain Sam Lanza sprained
his knee in practice last Tuesday.
Sam said he hopes to be back for
Friday’s home game against Ohio
State. ’

Conﬂnued from page 9
punting woes.

0 In goal line situations, Pitt
used an interesting backﬁeld
alignment. The tailback was FB
Derrick Lewis, and the fullback
was 6—foot-6-inch tight end Lionel
Sykes. This interesting formation
proved effective, resulting in three
touchdowns for Lewis.

- The band performed well,
but would have been better if it
hadn't lost two trumpet players
to Proposition 48. '

0 ESPN colorman Kevin Kiley
claims Marc Spindler is so intense
that they have to chain him up

_ after practice.

0 Best stat of the night? Marc

Spindler had more sacks (two)

then he has eyebrows—(one giant
brow that covers his whole
forehead).

0 In all fairness, Spindler’s
play was so exceptional he proved

’ why he is undoubtedly the best

defensive lineman in the country.

0 In a brief halftime segment,
ESPN showed a clip of Spindler
from 1987 and one from this year
and compared his techniques in
both. The biggest difference
seems to be the height of

Spindler’s initial charge. In '87,»

he stood straight up after the
snap of the ball, and this allowed

offensive linemen to‘get leverage a

on him; This year, however,
Spindler’s initial charge is low,
and he is able to blow into the

opponent's backﬁeld. It goes to i

show what good technique and

great athletic ability can do for a
player.

0 What wasthe purpose
behind giving students those
glow-in—the-dark discs before the
game? It seems the students
weren’t' really sure either;
therefore, they turned them into
frisbees, and pelted the
cheerleaders with them
throughout the course of the
game.

0 Defensive coordinator Bob
Valesante’s rotating defensive
system worked to perfection, and
it appeared that the Panthers were
always a little fresher and hungrier
than the Orange. J’

0 Pittls defense accumulated
eight sacks for 67 yards against
the offensive line that TbeSpom'ng

News rated as the best in the 

country. I’m sure Major Harris is ‘
more than a little worried because
he is protected by an offensive

, line that is less talented and less

experienced than Syracuse’s.
Then again, Orangeman QB Bill
Scharr can’t scramble 1ike.Major.

0 ESPN named Pitt defensive
back Louis Riddick as the NCAA
Scholar Athlete of the Week.
Riddick has a 3.4 QPA and is
majoring in economics.

0 Thesurprising ‘play of
freshman center Chris Sestili
enabled versatile lineman Dean
Caliguire to switch to right guard
for much of the game. Another
change in the offensive line
occurred when veteran Bill
Cherpak saw his first «action of
the season. However, Cherpak,

who suffered a spinal injury “

during spring practice, saw limited
playing time.

- Pitt’s game against West
Virginia next weekend will be
televised by ESPN, with the

starting time scheduled for 7:30 3

The Mountaineers are ranked 9th
and the Panthers are right behind
at number 10 in the AP poll..
