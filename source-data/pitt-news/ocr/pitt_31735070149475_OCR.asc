Pittsburgh
settles y

with G-20

plaintiffs

By Mallory Grossman A
News Editor

The city of Pittsburgh has settled
with 11 plaintiffs who sued the

‘city in September 2009 for dam-

ages incurred during the G—20
protests. -

City solicitor Daniel Regan
said that 11 of the 25 plaintiffs
agreed to the settlement, which
totaled $88,000, on Tuesday.
The plaintiffs will split the mon-
ey with each getting $8,000 —
$5,0o0jp1us1$3,000 each for
attorney. costs. The remaining
14 plaintiffs did not accept the
settlement and will continue to
proceed with the case.

Regan said that although the
city offered the settlement, it is
important to note that by do-
ing so, “the city did not admit
to any liabi1ity_or wrongdoing,
nor did the plaintiffs suffer any
damages.”

“The decision was made be-
tween the city and the insurance
carrier that this was the most
prudent way to resolve this liti-
gation,” Regan said.

The city has to defend all
cases brought against it, which
comes at a cost regardless of
cases’ results. In order to limit
the cost the city will incur, Regan

' said the city decided to settle

with the plaintiffs‘.

ACLU attorney Sara Rose
said city police arrested the 25
plaintiffs in Oakland on Sept. 25,
2009, "as part of_a mass arrest
following the G—20 summit. The
plaintiffs ﬁled a lawsuit against
the city because they believed
their First and Fourth Amend-
ment rights were violated as a
result of the arrests, she said.

- “They were basically not
given an avenue to disperse to

State

By Mary Mallampalli
Staff Writer

After losing $40 million in state
funding in June, Pitt has been
asked by the Commonwealth
to freeze its spending by 5 per-
cent. —

Onjan. 4, Gov. Tom Corbett is-
sued a $160 millionvbudget freeze
to all state institutions as a result
of lower—than-expected economic
growth during the ﬁrst half of the
2011-2012 ﬁscal year.

“Until revenue collections im-
prove, we must take precautions
to ensure that the Commonwealth
budget remains in balance,” Cor-
bett said in a press release.’

While most state agencies have
been askedto freeze their bud-
gets by 3 percent, Pitt and other
state-related schools will suffer a
5 percent cut in their budgets for
the latter half of the ﬁscal year.

V State appropriations to Pitt,
Penn State, Temple University
and Lincoln University represent

less than 2 percent of the ‘state’s
budget, yet spending cuts by such
schools account for 16 percent
of the $1604million freeze, ac-
cording to a press release from
Chancellor Mark Nordenberg.

Nordenberg said the reduction
in funding will be assigned to the
ofﬁce-of the chancellor, the chief
financial officer, the executive
vice chancellor, and the provost
and senior vice chancellor for the
health‘ sciences. The University
officer in charge of each office
will ultimately decide where and
howto cut spending. a

“Pitt always seems to have
been expected to do more with
less, but we never have been
as good at it as we are today,”
Nordenberg said in the press
release.

Although the chancellor’s ex-
ecutive officers have yet to decide

where and how to handle the cuts ’

in funding, the governor’s new
budget freeze has not officially
affected tuition for Pitt students

-in the 2012-2013 school year. The

University increased tuition by

8.5 percent for in-state students
and 4 percent for out—of-state
students after receiving the 22
percent reduction in state fund-
ing in June.

Pitt refused to comment fur-
ther on the budget cut and where
the cuts would go. ‘

5 The University began the ﬁscal
year with a $133,933,000 budget
— after a 22 percentreduction in
state funding - but the freeze
will cut the University’s budget
by another $6.8 million.

In total, the state’s budget
freeze will cut funds to'hea1th
care, education and human ser-
_vices by $222,394,000.

The total reduction among
Pitt, Penn State, Lincoln Uni-
versity and Temple University
totals $25.7 million, according to
the»-press release from C0rbett’s
office. Penn State saw the larg-
est cut in spending, losing $11.3
million. '

Although these public uni?

versities will have even less to
spend for the next few months,
other public agencies, such as

spending freeze hits higheretlucation

the State Police and the_Depart—
ment of Corrections will only be
required to freeze 1 percent of
their spending, and Pennsylvania
Emergency Management Agency
has not been directed to freeze
any of its budget for the rest of
the ﬁscal year.

Pitt and other public universi-
ties aren’t the only ones seeing
sudden and immense cuts to their
budgets. Grants to the arts, ag-
ricultural research, promotion,
education and exports, trauma
centers, state—related academic
medical centers and teacher pro-
fessional development will all
suffer from a 10 percent reduc-
tion in their budgets for the rest

_ of the ﬁscal year.

“We did not make the deci-
sion to freeze these funds light-
ly,” Corbett said. “If the revenue
picture improves in the months
ahead, and we determine these
funds no longer need to remain
frozen, we may be available to
free up some or perhaps even all
of the funds we are placing into
budgetary..reserv.e.”_l_. ._ _ _ _ _ _

Keystone XL Pipeline sparks environmental eontrovers

President Barack Obama to make decision concerning construction of pipeline by Feb. 21

By Drew Shull
Staﬂ" Writer

The weekend before the fall se-
mester started, Pitt students‘
Nikki Luke and Eva Resnick-
Day were in the back of a paddy
wagon. They were waiting to be
processed after committing a
premeditated offense in direct
defiance of police orders. Their
crimes were the same: sitting
in the designated.“Picture and
Postcard Area” in front of the
White House and refusing to
move after receiving two verbal
warnings.

Luke and Resnick-Day are

%co—presidents of Free the

Planet, an environmental ad-
vocacy group at Pitt, and went
to Washington, D.C., to protest
a proposed 1,700-mile pipeline
that would carry unprocessed

oil sands from Alberta, Cana-.

da, to Texas to be refined. The
construction project is highly
controversial because of its
environmental impacts, which
include potential oil spills. On
the other hand, the pipeline can
potentially create thousands
ofjobs. ,

Seth Bush, a past president
and board member of Free the
Planet, was arrested for the
same offense in the same dem-
onstration a week after Luke
and Resnick—Day. His opposi-
tion to the pipeline comes from
his goal ofbreaking the United
States’ dependence on oil.

“It’s like a heroin addict who
constantly talks about getting
clean, and he has a plan to get
clean, but there’s always one
more hit. This is one more hit,”
Bush said. “If Obama passed
this pipeline, it would be a
blunt and clear statement that
we _aren’t willing to break our
addiction on oil.”

 

‘On Dec. 22, Congress passed
an extension to the Payroll Tax
Cut, a popular measure signed
by President Barack Obama.
But tacked onto the bill was
a rider that would force the
president’s hand on the Key-
stone XL Pipeline. He has until
Feb. 21 to approve or deny the
pipeline.

“We just want

him to be the

, president he

said he would
  be...”

-Eva Resnick-Day

Like many energy projects,
estimates ofthe costs and ben-
efits vary depending on whom
you ask. TransCanada, the
company leading the project,
proposed the pipeline in 2008
and claims it will provide a
supply of crude oil to U.S. Gulf
Coast refineries and provide
morejobs. But environmental-
ists want Obama to break the
country’s dependency on oil
in the hope of preventing oil
spills.

Jennifer Victor, a Pitt politi-

cal science professor, said that
while Obama threatened to veto
the bill if the pipeline came at-
tached to it, the Republicans
called his bluff.

While this might seem like
a setback for the environmen-
talists, Luke said that she felt

“confident” Obama would re- .
ject the plan without additional

environmental oversight.

“If we said no, it would be
the first time — at least in my
studies of environmental stud-
ies — that we said no to oil,”
said Luke, an environmental
science major. .

The president isn’tjust fac-
ing pressure from the oil in-
dustry and congressional Re-
publicans on the issue. Several
important unions, including
the AFL-CIO and the Team-
sters, expressed their support
for the bill. The oil industry
promises that the pipeline will
create thousands. of jobs during
a time when unemployment is
a hot button issue in the presi-
dential election.

TransCanada promises
13,000 construction jobs and
7,000 manufacturing jobs in
addition to 118,000 “spin-off
jobs” created as a result of the
project, according to its web-
site. ,

Others say the actual fig-
ures will be much lower. The
State Department report es-
timated that the construction
jobs would be closer to 5,000
to 6,000 temporary jobs, and
a study done by Cornell Uni-
versity noted that half of the
manufacturing would be out-
side of the United States.

Much of the environmental

.controversy. arises from the

underground pipeline’s threat
to an important aquifer in Ne-
braska. Groundwater contami-
nation expert and Pitt profes-
sor Daniel Bain said there are
increased risks with an under-
ground pipeline.

“The problem with under-
ground pipeline is that you can’t
see problems when they arise,”
Bain said. “Once the contami-
nation is there, it will be there
for along, long time.”

Bain said that if the pipe-

line spills, which he said was
likely without perfect engineer-
ing and perfect maintenance,
the oil is, very hard to remove
from the aquifer. Although
some contamination wouldn’t
necessarily upsetagriculture, it
would ruin the aquifer for hu-
man consumption, he said.

While, the president still has.

another month and a half to
respond, the environmental-
ists are claiming a small vic-
tory in the fight that started
in August.

Bush said that without the
continued advocacy, which in-
cluded the August action and a

' massive protest that surround-

ed the White House one year
to the day before election day,

the pipeline might have been .

approved without much public
attention.
“We wouldn’t even be having

 .P'lT“5W3—l39M-  

this conversation,” he said.

Victor agrees. While she
qualiﬁed that it is impossible
to know exactly what made this
issue unfold the way it did, the
environmentalists were able to
bring a lot ofattention to the
pipeline.

“A few months ago, Cana-
dian oil sands were a brand new
idea,” she said. “I’m not sure if
the protests were the defini-
tive event, but I certainly think
their efforts were effective.”

Resnick-Day was not ready
to declare victory. She de-
scribed herself as cautiously
optimistic but said she would
consider withholding support
from~President Obama this year
if he approved the pipeline.

“We just want him to be the
president he said he would be
—— the president wethought he
wouldbe,” she said. I .

I think we should stop teaching
high school students about 9/11.

It’s just too divisive and dan-
gerous. Hate crimes and hostility
tqward Muslims and Arabs have
been on the rise since the event ——
there’s no need to make it worse
by reminding everyone about it
all the time. 4 .

While we’re at it, the bombing
of Pearl Harbor should probably
be phased out of the curriculum.

;,It’s just too easy for a high school

student learning about these
atrocities to get the idea that
regular Muslims and Japanese-
Americans,— their classmates,

‘ even — are somehow to blame for

the deaths of their countrymen.
Teaching such awkward histories
will only foster division and racial
animosity.

If you think I’m an extremist
lunatic and that sort of sacriﬁce-
the—facts-to-avoid-discomfort
reasoning doesn’t belong any-
where near the United States
school system, you’re half right.

  
  
 
 
 
  
   
  
 
 
  
  
    
   

I absolutely do not advocate
removing '9/11 or Pearl Harbor
from our public schools’ history
curriculum. Like you-, I believe
you’d have to be nuts to censor
history to avoid breeding racial
tension among impressionable
teenagers. History is history,

...you’d have to be nuts

racial tension among

and an even vaguely competent
educator should have no difﬁculty
teaching a high school student the
difference between the terrorists
who ﬂew planes into the World
Trade Center and the Muslim-
American student sitting in the

. This is why I think it’s nuts that
an Arizona judge recently ruled
that teaching Mexican—American
history in high schools is a viola-
tion of state law, arguing that the
program promotes racial resent-
ment against white people by ac-
curately teaching the history of
white-on-Latino racist oppres-
sion in the United States.

Judge Lewis Kowal found
grounds to withhold 10 percent
of the already—cash-strapped
Tucson Uniﬁed School District’s
monthly state aid until it comes
into compliance with the ruling
and eliminates courses “designed
primarily for one ethnic group.”

The comparison to the teach-
ing of 9/11 and the Pearl Harbor
bombing was ﬁrst proposed by
anti—racist author Tim Wisein his
recent essay, ‘.‘Telling White Lies:
Patriotic Correctness and the War,
on Ethnic Studies.” As Wise points
out, U.S. courts only see ﬁt to edit
history to protect the reputation
of an ethnic group when that eth-
nic group happens to be white
people. When the perpetrators of

Reimagine, don’t recycle, art

Courtney Strauss
Columnist

“Shrek the Musical,” “Spider-Man:
Turn Off the Dark” and “The Little
Mermaid” all hit Broadway recently,
some with more success (and stunt
doubles) than others. Regardless
of their reception, they’re part of
an ongoing trend: Books become
movies, stage plays become mini-
series, and so on. We constantly

recycle our culture. Although we ‘

love to buy belts made from old
bottle caps and water bottles that
were once mounds of plastic, I’m a
bit concerned with Americans’ love
of recycled art. Some things are like
Kleenex: not meant to be reused. I
deem recycling art, in most cases,
a sin. /

My strong distaste for adapta-
tions formed at a young age when
I decided to watch the movie “The
Face on the Milk Carton” after read-
ing the Caroline B. Cooney book.
The protagonist, I protested, had
red hair! The cafeteria scene dia-

logue was different! I couldn’t take .

it! I turned the TV off and ranted to
my mother, “How could someone
do this to such awondérful story!?”
I was a dramatic child.

I generally agree with composer
Igor Stravinsky: “Lesser artists bor-
row; great artists steal.” However,
there’s a big difference between
drawing inspiration from a text —
in the way that Shakespeare’s “King
Lear” informs the tragic hero of
“Moby Dick” or the plot structure of
“The Odyssey” informs “O Brother
Where Art Thou?” —— and transpos-
ing a piece of art into a different me-
dium to create an uninspired new
product bearing the same title.

Admittedly, certain works of
high art, like “The Godfather” movie
series, handle this transition well

and -retain the original text’s integ-
rity. But with uninspired adapta-
tions, like the ﬁlm version of Audrey
Niffenegger’s “The Time Traveler’s
Wife,” the title is merely a market-
ing scheme, a pretext for erasing
plot points and amping up the gooey
romance. It’s maybe not so surpris-
ing, then, that when Niffenegger
spoke two years ago at Carnegie Mu-
sic Hall, she announced she hadn’t

such crossovers is the process they
involve: People with creative control
extract bits and pieces of the origi-
nal work, give characters the same
names, set the story in the same
location and then exclaim, “Voila,
we’ve created Charlie Chaplin’s ‘City
Lights’ on ice!” This example is ﬁcti-
tious, but I don’t doubt its success
potential.

The theatrical adaptation of the
movie “Once,” which is currently
running off-Broadway at the New
York Theatre Workshop, might epit-
omize this problem if reviews are
any indication. “Charm is fragile,”

ley writes. “What’s enchanting in
one context  can seem soppy or
strident in another.” In other words,
many stories are best told — indeed,
created to be told -— in one speciﬁc
art form. Brantley goes on to explain
that the movie’s naturalandunder—
stated performances, many of which
were improvised, saved it from suc-
cumbing to the cutesy cliches that
often plague rom-coms. Musicals
are a different animal, however, and
the “Once” adaptation seems to have
turned theiunique ﬁlm into a live
action cliche.

To cite a less contemporary ex-

ample, Martin Scorseseclanf‘ only
recall one scene in “Rebecca,” Al-
fred Hitchcock’s adaptation "of-the
Daphne du Maurier novel‘ of the

same name, where the ﬁlm captures .

the eeriness of the book. The rest he
deems, after roughly a dozen Views,
no longer interesting, largely be-
cause Hitchcock prioritized plot at
the expense of other concerns.
There are several problems un-
derlying this phenomenon. One is
the creative control process in Hol-
lywood and the increasing inﬂuence

j of Hollywood on Broadway. Another .

is an underappreciation for the nu-

ances of words and images. The,

power of words on the page is differ-
ent than that of spoken words, and

h the power of a beautifully crafted

screen image,’ like the pottery scene
in the movie “Ghost,” is very dif-
ferent from the same image evoked
onstage — in the Broadway adapta-
tion of “Ghost,” for example.

If artists want their work to sur-
vive an adaptation, they need to bear
in mind the distinctions between
mediums. Otherwise, the result
will be second-rate — the artistic
equivalent of a once-used tissue. I

unpleasant historical events don’t ‘

look — or practice religion — like
the archetypal God—fearing white
American, we’re all too eager to
ensure that their trespasses are,
to paraphrase the famous slo-
gan, “never forgotten.” Yet we’re
happy to forget decades of co-
lonialist military interventions
in Latin American countries, the
colonialist intentions and white
supremacist ﬂavor of the Mexican
War and the deportation of count-
less Mexican—American citizens
in the 1930s to free up jobs fo
white men. ’

Those historical truths are
omitted in mainstream history
classes -— and not just in Tucson.
“Lies My TeacherTold Me,” an
alternative textbook by James
Loewen, showcases ‘the way
high school history textbooks
gloss over important facts when
they’re ugly -— like Woodrow
Wi1son’s affinity for the Ku Klux

Helen Keller’s ardent socialism.
The book illustrates the scope of
the problem by picking apart the
ﬂaws and omissions in speciﬁc
textbooks —— among them “The
American Pageant,” which-was
used to teach myown AP U.S. His-
tory class in a high school that
sends dozens of students to Pitt
each year.

That’s because, as opponents
of the Tucson schools’ ethnic
studies program seem to forget,
standard high school U.S. History

classes are already designed pri— '

marily for one ethnic group. This
is probably why the Tucson Uni-
ﬁed School District developed the
ethnic studies program to begin

Pitt hpes to end Iosingstreak

By Nate Barnes
Staﬂ” Writer

The Pitt men’s basketball team
posted its lowest point total in
29 years in its loss to Rutgers on
Wednesday.

The Panthers shot a dismal 21.1
percent from the ﬁeld in falling to
the Scarlet Knights 62-39 to re-
main winless in the Big East.

On Saturday, the Panthers will
travel to Milwaukee in search of
their ﬁrst Big East triumph in the
midst of a ﬁve-agame skid that be-‘
gan Dec. 23 against Wagner at the
Petersen Events Center.

“We have to execute better,”

Pitt senior Nasir Robinson said‘

after the loss to Rutgers. “The last
couple of practices we’ve been do-
ing better, but we need to make it
translate to the game.”

Pitt (11-6, 0-4 Big East) will face
arguably its toughest matchup of
the season on Saturday against
No. 24 Marquette (13-4, 2-2 Big
East) —— the ﬁrst ranked team that
the Panthers have played this sea-
son.

squad that possesses the assets on

six games. 9 a g

An inability to defend scorers
on the perimeter has plagued the
Panthers all year. In each of its six
losses, an opposing guard led the
contest in scoring. ‘

Rutgers guard Eli Carter scored
14 points Wednesday. DePaul guard
Brandon Young scored 26 points
onjan. 5. Cincinnati guardsjaquon
Parker and Sean Kilpatrick posted
21 and 19 points, respectively, on
New Year’s Day.

On Dec. 27, Notre Dame guard
Alex Dragicevich scored 22 points
while guards Eric Atkins and Je-
rian Grant each scored 15 points.
The 52 combined points were just
seven points shy of what the nine
Panthers who played that night
mustered overall.

In nonconference play on Dec.
23, Wagner guard Latif Rivers
scored 18 points in his team’s up-
set of the then-No. 13 Panthers.
In Pitt’s ﬁrst loss of the season,
Long Beach State guard Casper
Ware scored 28 to hand Pitt a loss
at home, which at the time was
rare.

same damage on the Panthers.

Coming off a 20-point perfor-
mance in ,Marquette’s 83-64 vic-
tory over St.]ohn’s Wednesday, the
6-foot—2, 215—pound guard ranks
fourth in the Big East in scoring,
posting 18 points per game in 16
contests this season.

He’s also shot the basketball
relatively well this season, shoot-
ing 44 percent overall and making
2.1 3-pointers per game.

In the post, Pitt’s frontcourt
players will face a challenge in
the form of 6-foot-6, 225-pound
forward Jae Crowder. Crowder is
Marquette’s second leading scorer
and the leading rebounder with
16.5 points and 7.3 rebounds per
game.

‘ Syracuse head coach Jim Boe-
heim complimented both Odom
and Crowder after the Orange’s win
over Marquette.

“They are both tremendous
players,” he said’ in the postgame
press conference. “For their size,
they are as good as anybody in the
league. They play big. They play
tough. They are tough guys. They
rebound. They defend. They are
both just tremendous players.”

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL

  Panthers

Byjasper Wilson
Staff Writer

The Pitt women’s basketball team
will travel to No. 21 DePaul on
Saturday in pursuit of its first
Big East win.

After a tough two—game
stretch at home that included an
83-60 loss to Syracuse and a 63-
39 loss to Rutgers, the Panthers
are welcoming the chance to go
on the road.

" Head coach Agnus Berenato
said the team’s play at Villanova
onjan. 3 —— despite a 70-62 loss
— gives the team conﬁdence as it
heads out on its second Big East
road trip.

Redshirt sophomore Abby
Dowd struggled to explain the
team’s success away from Pitts-
burgh. The Panthers lost to Duke
and High Point on the road ear-
lier this season, but played well
against Villanova and won the
Caribbean Classic in Mexico.

“Thus far I think we’ve played
better on the road,” Dowd said.
“I don’t knowwhy. [It’s] weird.
When we go on the road, it’s
almost like we’re a different
team.”

She also attempted to explain
the team’s inconsistency.

“Sometimes I feel like we just
come out slow and dig ourselves
in a hole, or we play a good first
half and then the ﬁrst ﬁve m_in—
utes of the second half is where
we really shoot ourselves in the
foot,” Dowd said.

The Panthers will need to
perform well for a complete
game in order to defeat DePaul
in Chicago, as the Blue Demons
are a perfect 8-0 at home this
season.

The Panthers said they know
they can compete — their win
over reigning Big Ten champion
Michigan State over the holidays
shows as much — it’s just a mat-
ter of executing.

“We know we can [play well]
and I think that’s what’s so frus-
trating,” Dowd said. “It’s frus-
trating to know how much talent
you have on the team [and then
not perform] .”

The Blue Demons, who have
been hit hard by a collection of
injuries, lost to Providence 60-52
in their most recent game, but
beat No. 18 Georgetown 59-50
the game before.

All-American Keisha Hamp-

Big East sixth man of the year,
are currently sitting out with

Hampton, a senior, -averaged
16.6 points per game before
injuring her right knee against
Princeton on Dec. 13.

Pikes, also a senior, hasn’t
played yet this year as she con-
tinues to recover from her own
knee injury that she suffered in
last year’s NCAA Tournament.

Offensively, the injuries
haven’t spelled disaster for De-
Paul.

The Blue Demons still have

three players averaging double -

ﬁgures. junior Anna Martin is the
Big East’s third highest scorer
at 18.4 points per game, while
freshman Brittany Hrynko and
sophomore Jasmine Penny pro-
vide support with 10.7 and 10.1

for Pitt to produce on the offen-
sive end, as it has a positive effect

The relationship between the
two means scoring is especially
crucial Saturday night, as DePaul
averages 76.5 points per game.

“We have to put the ball in the
basket,” Anderson said. “We do
avgood job defensively, but you

Berenato also stressed the

have to work on maintaining pos-
session. Pitt turns the ball over
19.6 times a game —-— the second
worst average in the Big East.
DePaul allows the secondmost
points per game in the Big East
at 63.1, while Pitt allows a league
worst 67.5 points ‘per contest.
The first step to Pitt pick-
ing up its ﬁrs_t conference win
will be staying within striking

distance. The Panthers’ last two

losses have come by 24 points

to No. 8 Rutgers and 23 points

to Syracuse.

“We’re going to -go in there
and compete,” Anderson said.
“We can go in there and say we’re
going to shock the wor_ld and get
this upset, but we just have to
compete ﬁrst. And that’ll be our
biggest thing.”

Dowd agreed.

“At this point we need to fo-
cus on getting better every single

his current pace of 17.5 points
and 10.8 rebounds per game, he
might just win the Big East Player
of the Year award.

3. Georgetown — After’ an
impressive 13-1 start, the Hoyas
(13-3, 3-2 Big East) find them-

selves on the back of two straight
losses and facing three road trips
in their next four games. For now,
head coach John Thompson III’s
team — led by senior guardjason
Clark and sharp-shooting junior
forward Hollis Thompson ——
sits third in my standings based
on what it has already accom-
_plished. But if the Hoyas don’t

' right the ship quickly, George-

town could ﬁnd itself slipping
quickly down the conference and
national rankings.

4. Connecticut — As the de-
fending Big East tournament and
national champions, the Huskies
(13-3, 3-2 Big East) couldn’t have
asked for a better 2011; Although’

a

 "last year’s hero Kemba Walker’
is now gone, Connecticut has A

another bona ﬁde superstar in
sophomoreJeremy Lamb, who is
third in the conference with 18.6
points per game. After recent
road losses at Rutgers and Seton
Hall, the Huskies must success-
fully deal with upcoming trips

. to Notre Dame, Georgetown,

Louisville and Syracuse if they
are to remain one of the confer-
ence’srelite.
5. Marquette — The Golden
Eagles (13—4, 2-2 Big East) have
A lost four of their last seven games
after an 8-0 start, but head coach
Buzz Williams’ t_eam’s effort in its
loss at Syracuse keeps Marquette
relatively high in my first rank-
ings. Down as many as 23, the
Golden Eagles cut the deficit to
two points later on but couldn’t
come out with the victory, asthe
No. 1 team in the country held
them off. With senior guard
Darius Johnson-Odom and his
18 points per game leading the

team, Marquette couldonce
again be a surprise threat come
tournament time. _

l 6. West Virginia — The Moun-
taineers (12-5, 3-2 Big East) —
a team flying under the radar
right now -— might be set for a
strong second half of the sea-
son. Bob Huggins’ team boasts
the Big East’s leading scorer and
rebounder in senior forward Kev-
in Jones, who is at 19.9 points
and 11.5 boards per game. With
a strong supporting cast and a
schedule that includes only one
remaining road game against a
ranked team, West Virginia looks

’ ready to make a big surge up the
standings. '

7-. Notre Dame —’ Despite
struggling in nonconference
play, the Irish (11-6, 3-1 Big East)
seem to be far more comfortable
against familiar Big East opposi-

‘tion. Losing leading scorer Tim

Abromaitis to a season—ending
injury might hurt Notre Dame
more down the road, but conﬁ-

‘dence-building wins against Pitt,
Louisville and South Florida and _

a relatively favorable schedule
should be enough to keep the
Irish in the top half of the stand-
ings throughout the season.

8. Cincinnati —- When start-
ing center Yancy Gates was sus-
pended for throwing punches in a
loss to Xavier, not many would’ve
predicted that the Bearcats (13—4,
3-1 Big East) would win their next
seven games. But that’s exactly
what Mick Cronin’s team did. .The
sixth-year head coach has had
to employ some unconventional
tactics in the absence-of Gates,
including playing ﬁve guards at
once for stretches. Now that its

nkings, Pitt drops to last ,

center is back, Cincinnati could
be a team to watch out for.

9. Rutgers

10. Louisville

11. St. John’s

12. Providence

13. South Florida

14. Villanova

15. DePaul

16. Pittsburgh —— It might be
surprising for some to see the
defending Big East regular-sea-
son champions last in this year’s
standings. However, anyone who
has watched the Panthers’ (11-
6, 0-4 Big East) recent perfor-
mances knows the ranking is
justified. The Panthers are on a

ﬁve-game losing streak and are,_

coming off their worst perfor-
mance of the season in a blow-
out loss to Rutgers at home. Still,
things might get worse before
they get better for Pitt. Four‘ of
the Panthers’ next ﬁve games are
against ranked opponents, and
as long as starting point guard
Travon Woodall is sidelined with
his abdomen and groin injuries,
Pitt’s offensive struggles will
likely continue.

What to watch for next week...

—— Just how good is Syracuse?
With no ranked matchups in Big
East play over the next week, I’ll
be curious to see just how good
the undefeated Orange are. Two
homes games against Providence
and Pitt — who have a combined
one win in conference play so far
— might not be the most daunt-
ing of tasks for the No. 1 team
in the country. However, with
two more dominating victories,
talk of an unprecedented perfecta
season in Big East play will begin
to emerge. ﬂ

MEN'S BASKETBALL

FROM PAGE 7

forward Davante Gardner, a 6-foot-
8, 290-pound bruiser whose size
will provide matchup problems for
the Panthers. Although Gardner
averages just 8.7 points per game,
he is fourth in shooting percentage
among Big East players, making
baskets at a 59 percent clip. ‘
Countering -and containing
Marquette’s talented‘ trio will be
key for the Panthers on Saturday.
Pitt’s Ashton Gibbs hopes to
get back on track after lackluster
shooting performances in the past
few games. Most recently, he shot
2-11 from the ﬁeld against Rutgers

and didn’t make any of the seven.
3-point shots he attempted.
Although Gibbs leads the Pan-
thers in scoring at 16.7 points per
game, the senior guard is currently
shooting a career-low 38.7 percent.
And, despite his renown as one of
the deadliest shooters from be-
yond the arc in the country, Gibbs’

_ 3-point percentage also dropped to
A a career-low 36 percent.

“I have to be more patient on
the screens, and when I ﬁnd myself
open, I have to knock down the
shot,” Gibbs said after the loss to
Rutgers. “I have great expectations
for myself, and I need to step up
and make shots.”

His drop in effectiveness can
likely be - attributed to the ab-

sence of starting point guard Tra-
von Woodall, who has missed all
but one game since suffering an
abdominal tear and groin strain
during the City Game against
‘Duquesne on Nov. 30.

-In Woodall’s absence, Gibbs
has been forced to take control of
running the offense and is unable
to focus on his greatest strength:
shooting.

Gibbs’ classmate Nasir Rob-
inson hopes to help the Panthers
turn their season around. A spike
in scoring complements Robin-
son’s hustle and passing ability.
Robinson is second on the team
in scoring, averaging 12.9 points
a game. He also leads a thin Pitt’
frontcourt in rebounding, grab-

bing 6.7 boards per game.

However, Robinson has not
been immune to the poor play
afflicting many Panthers, and he
said he was disappointed with
the Panthers’ performance on the
board against Rutgers. The Scarlet
Knights outrebounded Pitt by 16.

“It was the most disappointing
thing about the game because that
is our main focus,” he said after the
game. “We have to do a better job
boxing out, and we can’t let them
out-hustle us.”

In the event that Woodall does
not return from his injury Saturday
night, another Panther will need‘
to step up and produce against
Marquette.

Lamar Patterson has shown the

ability to put the ball in the basket,
and Talib Zanna has also posteds
nice scoring totals throughout the
season.

However, it remains to be seen
if either of these players can give
Gibbs and Robinson the support
they will need to pull out a tough _
win on the road. “’

This is a matchup that Pitt
should view as a must—win game in
order to begin to salvage a season
that is quickly deteriorating.

. “The kids are extremely dis-
appointed. We are disappointeday
as a staff, and we know our fans
are disappointed,” Pitt head coach
Jamie Dixon said after the loss to
Rutgers. “We are very sorry for
how we played.” 3
