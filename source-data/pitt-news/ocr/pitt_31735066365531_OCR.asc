Sheehan to explore , e   .
Pentagoit Papers here      campalgn   1)

by JOYCE GEMPERLEIN A

. One of the most controversial series published‘ by the New
York Times—the Pentagon Papers—will be explored by Neil
Sheehan, a Times reporter, in a speech Tuesday at 8 p.m. in the

Student Union Ballroom.

Sheehan, whose articles on the U.S. government’s secrecy concern-
ing decisions in Vietnam shocked the nation, will ‘also field questions
at 5:30 p.m. in the Student Union Supper Room. _

The Pentagon Papers erupted into a major controversy when
Daniel Ellsberg. a RAND analyst. allegedly leaked the secret docu-
ments to Sheehan. A court order temporarily halted the New York
Times publication of this information. Ellsberg is scheduled to be tried

sometime this year.

Bill Gormley, editor of the Pitt News, outlined the importance of
both the issue and the reporter: “The publication of the Pentagon Pa-
pers by the New York Times raises some intriguing questions about the
public’s right to know, the-extent of justifiable government secrecy,
and the newspaper’s role in transmitting information. -

“As the journalist whose investigative reporting set the stage for

. the Times’ historic decision,’-‘ Gormley added, "Sheehan is in a unique

position to discuss both governmental secrecyﬂand the responsibilities

of a newspaper.”

Since his 1958 graduation from Harvard, where he was a member
of the editorial board of the Harvard Advocate, Sheehan has served in
the armed forces in Korea and Japan. In addition to an award lauding
his newspaper work there, Sheehan has received numerous journalism
awards. One is the Lewis M. Lyons Memorial Award for conscience and

integrity in journalism.

In 1962, Sheehan was appointed the Vietnam Bureau chief for ‘Unit-
ed Press International. He. joined the staff of the New York Ti'mes in

4 1964 and is now a Washington-based reporter specializing in politics,

diplomacy and military affairs. His only book, The Arnheiter Affair.

was‘ published in.April of 1971.

Sheehan’s appearance at the University is being jointly sponsored
by the Pitt News, the Student Association, and.the General Studies

Cabinet.

According to Gormley, the Pitt News is helping finance Sheehan’s

Position bewilders cautious student trustee

by MIKE MILLER

' Pennsylvania Governor Milton
Shapp recently appointed Sharon
Novak, a 22-year-old graduate
student, to the Board of Trustees
of the University of Pittsburgh.

The appointment was confirmed
early this week and yet Novak has
no clear idea of what her role on
the board will be.

 

NOVAK:
“Independent Thinker.”

She stated that she ‘has not met
with all of the member_s of the

board and doesn‘t know whether-

she will assume the role of a gad-
fly or try to blend in as well as
possible.

When asked if she will try to
represent the student viewpoint
V or maintain an independent role,
she stated, _“I think that because
I am a student I can be a represen-
tative of the student viewpoint as
I perceive it and as it is, com-

9   e   it if

'1!

 
 

  
  

She characterized herself. how-
ever. as an "independent thinkerl"

Being a graduate .student will
present no problems in represent-
ing students as a whole. Novak
asserted.

‘:1 don’t see anyiproblem,” she
said. “I was an undergraduate at

one time and I feel that under-.

graduates and graduate students
have common problems which re-
volve around such things as fi-
nances and housing.”

So far. though, she has made
no attempt to establish liaison
with students through the Student
Affairs Advisory Committee or
any other group.

"My appointment was just con-
firmed and I haven‘t established
any lines of communication as
yet." — 0

Neither has she considered any

,issues which she will pursue in

her capacity as a trustee.

"I have only my own percep-
tions of what is going on." she
said. adding that it will be neces-
sary to attend board meetings be-

V fore deciding what issues to pur-

sue.

In his announcement. Governor

Shapp made it clear that Novak

will be a fully functioning trustee ‘
.and not just a student represen-

tative.

However, the Dec. 16 issue of
the University Times quoted No-

.vak,as,saying_tliat she ‘had only a

Two Pitt students have asked a
Federal./District Court to invali-
date a Pennsylvania rule that as-
signs married women the same
residence status as that of their‘
husbands for tuition purposes.

Dena Meyers and Cynthia Jo
Samuel have charged that an Au-
ditor General's ruling that the
"domicile of a wife (adult or a
minor) is that of her husband"

discriminates on the basis of sex.

The ruling is followed by “Pitt
and other state schools.

In their suit," Meyers and Sam-
uel also ask that damagesbe paid
to women forced to pay out-of-
state tuition rates because they

' married non-Pennsylvania resi-

dents.

According to Rule B-2 of the
state's Residency Policy, Penn-
sylvania women who are students
and marry out-of-state residents
retain in-state status. However,

ulty members.

I, The board has the ultimate re-
sponsibility as the legal head of
. the University.

Meyers and Samuel were not

J enrolled when they married non-

Pennsylvania residents. and have
therefore been paying the $980 per
term out-of-state tuition instead
of the $490 in-state rate.

“I think that whatlthe University
is doing is a flagrant violation of

the rights of women,” said Mey--

ers_, a graduate student _in Educa-
tion. —
Samuel, also a graduate. std-
dent. said that though she lived
in ‘Pennsylvania after moving
from New Jersey one yearprior to

. enrolling, voted in Pennsylvania

elections, and acquired Pennsyl-

fied her out-of-state because she

 ‘There will be no charge for lab or x-ray work ordered by the Health

I judicial head named

Bowen foresees “procedural” role

by JOYCE GEMPERLEIN

Earl Alden Bowen. newly-ap-
pointed Co-ordinator of the
Campus Judicial System. be-
lieves his role in student affairs
will revolve around the con-
cept of "procedure.”

"The job is a new one." Bo-
wen said. "My understanding
of one of its purposes is to
have an attorney with some legal
background avail-able to see that
students are afforded the basic
rights of due process. My job
was created as an aid to both
students and administration to
see that procedures are fair and
proper. I expect to be called
upon to submit opinions on is-
sues related to actual proceed-
ings."

Bowen is the first to fill the
position of Co-ordinator of the
Campus Judicial System. an
office created in September.
The finalization of the appoint-
ment rested with Dr. Alfred
Moye. Dean of Student Affairs.

Bowen is a 1970 graduate of
the University of Pittsburgh
Law School. In addition to be-

ing a partner in the‘ law firm

of Israel-Bowen, he has served
law clerk under Judge
Gwilym A. Price.

Describing his new position
as fitting his legal career
while involving him in Uni-
versity matters, Bowen distin-
guished his role from that of
adjudicator. He stated that his
"ad-
vising." rather than judging
and added that his advice will
extend to any matters having
legal foundations.

"I will look at procedures.
not judge them." he said. “Any
violaton of students’ rights will
be subject to my scrutiny.”

Bowen said that_problems in
housing, academic disputes.
schools, and controversies such
as security personnel enter-
ing students‘ rooms would un-
dergo his review.

Encouraging change where
necessary and supplying the le-
gal rationale for revisions of
campus policy is another facet
of Bowen’s position. He cited
the new Student Association
Constitution as one area in which
he expects to be consulted.

ing legal procedures are wel-

2 campus cops fired  
after assault incident

Two Campus Security officers
have been‘ dismissed from the
force, after an investigation by
Campus Security. I

The two officers, John Williams
and Jerry Brown, were dismiss-
ed because of their involvement
in an incident in the Nurses Resi-
dence (MCNR) Dec. 3.

Along with four other officers,
Williams and Brown had been

, charged Dec.’ 6 with aggravated

assault and battery and conspir-
acy to commit an unlawful act.
The plaintiff was a fellow Campus
Security officer, Wendell Johnson.
All seven officers were suspended
from Campus Security, pending
an investigation.

At a hearing Dec. 13 Magistrate

Jules Melograne dropped charges
against four of the officers, but he
held Williams. and Brown on as-
sault and battery charges.

Officer Johnson accused Wil-
liams of having assaulted him,
and three nursing students corro-
borated his testimony at the hear-
ing. t

According to Superintendent Jo-
seph Gil of Campus Security, the
other five officers involved in
the MCNR incident were reinstat-
ed Dec. 16 or 17 with partialback
Pay-

Gil explained that the amount

of back pay depended on the na- I

in the incident.

Faettlty Senate slates
registration hearings

by LOIS LEVENSON
Students dissatisfied with the University‘s method of registration
will have a chance to express their complaints and offer suggestions
at a public hearing.
The hearing, to be held on Tuesday and Wednesday from 2-5 p.m.,

in the Student Union Ballroom, was called by the Committee on Stu-
dent Affairs of the Faculty Senate.

The purpose of the hearing, according to Committee Chairman
Robert Connamacher. is to provide "a way to create a system that is
sensitive to the needs of the students."

_ The responsibility for forming a new system, said Connamacher,

. belongs to the administration, which has not offered any solutions.

“There have been some changes and some successes.“ he said.
“but registration is still a frustrating nightmare."

Dr. Brian Vargus, assistant professor of.Sociology and coordina-
tor for the hearing, said that the problems of incorrect invoices and ros-
ter_s, poor communication between registration desks and advisors

- and long lines still prevail.

According to Vargus the committee will prepare a report and a
list of suggestions based on the information gleaned from the hearing.
However, he stated that the committee has no power to enforce its
proposals.

The‘ committee hopes to hear especially from students who have
attended schools using different registration‘ systems. Connamacher
and Vargus agreed that a large attendance is needed to prove that
there is student interest in the problem.

Invited to speak and answer questions at the hearing are Chancel-
lor Wesley Posvar; P. V. Allshouse, registrar; James Beavers, direc-
tor of Student Accounts; Joseph Dutton, vice chancellor of Opera-
tions; Michael Hout, chairman of the CAS Cabinet; Fred Koloc, direc-

tor of the CAS Counseling Center; Paul Solyan. comptroller; and John

Townsend, professor of physics.

Senatorial scholarship

by EVAN PATTAK I
Associate Editor

A bill that would abolish Penn-
sylvania’s senatorial scholarship
program is bottled in committee
and will probably die there.

Thomas Lamb (D., Beechview),
Senate Majority Leader and chair-
man of the Senate Rules Commit-
tee, to which the bill was referred,
said last week‘ he did not “predict
any future for the bill.”

"I’m.notgoing to do anything
to terminate senatorial scholar-
ships,” Lamb said.

The bill, introduced last Tues-
day by Senator Wilmont D. Flem-
ing (R., Jenkintown) would phase
out the 87-year- old senatorial
scholarship program by 1976. sm-
dents currently receiving aid un-
der the program would continue
to do so.

Fleming called the program
“outmoded and timeworn.” ‘

“In some instances," he said,
"it’s used to provide political
favors, let’s be blunt about it."

Under the’ program, each of the

state’s?50 senators may award to_ ~

students of their choice half-tui-
tion scholarships to Pitt, Temple,
Penn State, the University of
Pennsylvania, and Lincoln Col-

Great Selection of Turtles,

lege. Funds for senatorial schol-
arships are provided by the five
universities.

(For the year 1969-70, Pitt
awarded_$493,972 in senatorial
scholarships which, according to
Student Aid Director Charles Dees,

represents one-fourth of the total

scholarship money allocated by the
University that year.) ~

Every year, each Senator may
grant _48 new single-term
awards, or 24 one-year scholar-
ships, or six new four-year
scholarships, to each of the five
schools. Senators may also stock-

-pile scholarships or transfer

them to colleagues.

cants are not required to demon-

The labor dispute between con-
struction workers and the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh was at least
temporarily settled when eight of

« 14 white workers laid off in No-

vember were rehired.

The University has agreed to-

accelerate its expenditures in
the Department of Physical Plant
so that the men could return to
work.

Leland Deck of the Insurance

Office, who was chief University ‘

negotiator during the dispute, said
that the men will be used to clean
up a three-week backlog that the
Department of Physical Plant
had purposely maintained.

However, Deck warned — that
there would be further layoffs in
the spring if no additional funds
were forthcoming.

"We’re spending money so fast
we won’t maintain the same work
force the rest of the year." he
said.

Presently the only hope for ad-
ditional funds rests on the pend-
ing settlement with the Universi-
ty’s insurance company for the
recent fire in the stadium's press
box. If the money is received,
men will be contracted to repair

senators employ methods of de-
termining need.

Fleming said he awards schol-
arships for one-year increments
only and requiresall candidates
to show financial need.

“You can never be sure it’s
(demonstration of need) right,”
said Fleming, “if you don’t have
the sophisticated analysis we have
through the state program (the
Pennsylvania Higher Education
Assistance Agency, or PHEAAL”

“We have a very fair and equit- ,
able process through the. PHEAA
that is based on need,” said Flem-./f
ing, who is chairman_ of the board-
of the PHEAA.

The PHEAA awarded roughly
$55'.5'million in scholarships on a

vember 10, Flaherty let it be

known that he expects the Uni-

versity to, cough up cash for the
City as its part of the bargain.
Shortly after the meeting with
Flaherty, Chancellor Posvar told
the Pitt News that the University

cannot “legally" contribute
state funds to the City. While he
expressed sympathy for the

City’s financial problems, Pos-
var argued that a University
payment to the City would in

effect be a drain on state funds, ~

since the state subsidizes the
University. »

In an interview Tuesday; Pos-
var expressed an altered version
of that theme. “We cannot feas-
ibly undertake any significant
commitment to compensate the
City,” Posvar said. '

Asked whether he meant that
a contribution other than a sig-
nificant one cmight be made,
Posvar said/he was considering
offeringthe City $10,000 - $30,-
000. ’ . _ _

The Chancellor hastened to
add that such a gift. it made,
would be awarded to‘ the ‘City

culum is based in the Triangle

bean and in the United States. T

Bolstering the curriculum of-
ferings, the department has pro-
jected international education
and research programs for un-

dents, in the Caribbean, Africa
and elsewhere in the continental

tat message is clear:. no expan-
sion unless the University com-
pensates the City for the loss of
taxable property.

According to Robert Pater-
noster,/ Director of City Plan-
ing, Flaherty will permit a
tax-exempt institution like the
Universityito expand if arrange-
ments are made ‘to compensate

the City for taxes lost as_ a

result of the expansion.‘

The graduate Black _Studies
major will be prepared to sur-
vive ‘academically and- other-
wise, to- continue studying at

to create work for the Black
communities“ of this nation or

wherever his experience should V

take him in the world. 0

We have had to go straight
to the brain, to equip the stu-
dent of Black Studies to deal
with the world as it is, to make
mental developments based upon
knowledge and deep understand-
ing of the Black position in the
world, of a people facing the sys-

«Black Studies as instigated

to believe that he can treat the

it is political pressure which

A Profound Paradox

The limitations of the Black

only in the confused rhetoric of
those who have neither know-

what Black education is.
Black people in America live in
the midst of a most profound
paradox. That is, Black Ameri-
cans exist in the most materially
rich’, spiritually poor nation on
earth; surrounded by the know-
ledge of technology and wealth

which offers a promise which
'n.emains unfulfilled. , .

have gathered the wealth and
discovered the technical means,
to make the _qe¢g§§g.ry human

ca’s failure. The Black educa-

to prepare students to make
some headway in fulfilling the
potential. —

using academic study, analysis
and projection as a vehicle for

Monkeys exhibit inborn aggression

by VINCE DI NARDO

Dr. Allyn C. Deets hasn‘t exact-
ly been having more fun than a
barrel of monkeys the last five
and one-half years.

Deets. a research associate at
Pitt‘s Laboratory‘ of Clinical Sci-
ences. and Harry F. Harlow of
Wisconsin. recently completed a
study which concluded that mon-
keys raised in isolation from the
sixth to the 12th months of their
lives and who were never taught
aggression showed definite inborn
aggressive traits.

And. because Deets ‘believes

that young monkeys and young I

babies share numerous similar-
ities. he concluded that aggres-
sion is also inborn in humans.

One similarity that monkeys
and babies share, he said, is that
at six months of age both show in-
discriminate traits.

Up to its sixth month, a baby
smiles when it meets strangers.
After this period (from six to 12
months) a baby tends to cry for
fear of losing its mothers.

And, claimed~Deets. while a
baby cannot attack like the mon-
key, the aggression is there.

He hopes that leading child psy-
chologists will be inspired, by the
study and do more work along
these lines. ‘

SERIOUS MONKEY BUSINESS

The monkeys used in the study.
of the Rhesus specie predominant
in India, are aggressive by nature.
Whenever threatened by a strang-
er - or a ‘foreign object while in
their cages, the monkeys were
less than the comical animals that
we are accustomed to seeing in
Tarzan movies.

They threw themselves at the
threatening object, -often‘ injuring
themselves against their cages.

DEETS

Serious Monkey Business

~Deets, who handled close to 50

animals during the experiment”

takes his work very seriously.
Even though he is in the monkey
business there is little that hap-
pens that amuses Deets.

.“Whenever you are dealing with
aggression,” Deets said,‘ “its very

serious business.”

At Pitt, Deets controls animals

that bare the scars of their inborn 

aggressive traits.

One or thespecimens blinded *
hi_mself'in one eye in‘ a fit of rage '

while another gashed himself with

his c_anine-like teeth. The teeth ‘

have since been remoyed.

HAIR-RAISING STORIES
The concluded study has not
been an overnight thing.
After‘ finishing. his undergrad-
uate degree. at Stanford, ‘Deets

' moved to Wisconsin, where he fin-

 

gether
didn't exactly go ape over the

   

 
 

ished his Ph.D. in both Child Psy-'

schology and Animal Behavior.
There he met Harlow. who
spent 15 years on the study.

Aside from a decade and a half —

on the study, Deets indicated that
Harlow would be a hit on the
banquetcircuit with his accumu-
lationof monkey stories.

Deets also has a few favor-

able memories.

"It doesn‘t happen very often."
Deets warned. "but sometimes
you can get so close to an animal’
that you can interact.

“One positive social response
of the Rhesus monkey is groom-
ing. I remember the times when
one monkey and I used to groom

each other. I’d run my hair on his.
. fur and he’d run his hand through

mine.” .- - _
Unthreatened. the Rhesus has a ,
few humorous characteristics.

The monkeys can smack their
lips and form their mouths into
oval shapes. resembling grade
school choir boys.

By smacking his lips, the Rhes-

‘ us,“is trying to saythat it.doesn’t

want to fight,” said/Deets. ‘

Whenever its lips become oval
shaped. it“_isgetting ready to at-

tack.

idea. In fact. on one occasion the

monkeys ‘had to be removed for .

fear of the death of one of them. - _

Deets hopes to do more work’
with the.40 monkeys he has at
his disposal in the laboratory. The

aggression involved, however,

might make it hard for Deets to
have some fun along the way.

‘ Student Cabinet Chairman Gordon Percy recently made public the

" results of an attitudinal survey completed by 1970 General Studies stu-
;_.dents last September.

V  Though he previously refusedvto divulge the survey results. Percy
explained that soon after the December publication of a Pitt News col-

”unin criticizing his silence, the Cabinet received "a number of in-‘
quiries” regarding the survey. This proved a crucial factor in determin-
.-.;‘i1»ng the turnabout, said Percy. .

 Psychological Service of Pittsburgh developed the questionnaire

i*with the aid»of students and faculty. After processing the survey, the T
rorganization last month submitted to the Cabinet a 62—page report
' outlining the findings. A

 According to the report, GS students “indicated moderate agree-

i_* -meg; that their courses in SGS are relevant to their life situations and
4!"-that the education they are receiving is filling their educational needs.”

_’ ’  ’In,additio’n, the report concluded,that "there was fairly strong de-
: nial of having observed instances of discrimination on the basis of race.

. The survey revealed that “there were several areas toward which
students indicated considerable dissatisfaction.”

The foremost complaint concerned the parking situation. Students

;‘:described it as "ridiculousffrustrating, and a joke,” the report states.
'v§Meter maids were pictured as “descending like parasites." with one,
"Wstiident offering his own unique solution: "I run over every meter maid
T3 .I see.”

7'  ‘Other particular problem areas cited included vending machines.
., tuition and fees, Book Center prices, the unspecified use of the Student
Activities Fee, and the Student Records Office.

"We all know student govern-
ment is different than the one that
disgusted the student body’ this

, year, because the form is differ-

ent,” Steinberg said. "It’s up to
students to get out and support
this change they‘ve been crying
for.” . -

New Dean of Student Affairs,
Dr. Alfred Moye, expressed dis-
may at student apathy, saying,
“I’m sort of turned off by the
amount of uninvolved students on
campus.

"If they’re disenchanted with

' form, if they’re disenchanted with

their activities, they have a
chance to express this,” Moye
said.

He urged students to “look at

‘ Feature Editor

Tired of waiting for the good
music revival? Jest pass the jug.
sprawl in the hay, and rest yer
weary bones a mite, ’cause as I
live and breathe. the Kinks are at
itagain.

After the white-covered slipped
disc (which shall here remain
nameless) containing "Lola”
(perhaps the lone cut attaining a
semblance of musicality) and in-
curring upon the band the loss of
critical favor and a plunge to the

‘bottom of the ranks of ill repute,
Ray Davies and Company have re-
gained the poise of the fallen era-
delivering a dandy package wor-
thy of the boys who once cheered
the hearts of millions. (Well, thou-

‘ sands, anyway.)

Jammed chock full of the uni-
que Kink ingredients of vaude-
ville rock, and echoes of the days
when the sun never set on the Bri-
tish Empire, Muswell Hillbillies
is a delightful blend of skillful
parody and social comment—not
to mention a generous sprinkling
of country corn flakes and plain
old-fashioned fun and games. -

. Astraight rocker. kicks it all off

. with the tale of a “20th Century

Man." “living in the age of insan-

ity.” “I don‘t wanna be here,” ,

he laments. relaying a message
vaguely similar to that of the less
competently conceived "Ape
Man.“

"Alcohol" is another gleaming
track that rightly ought to be per-
formed by a Salavation Army
Band oomphing on some forsaken
skid row corner. Direct from the
gutter, Davies mourns, "Who
thought I would fall a slave to de-
mon alcohol?” in his sing-song vo-
cal style. Sniffle, sob. . . . .

Another “tearjerker,” “Here

Come the People in Gray” might .

aptly be labeled “muted rock ‘n’
roll,” drawing the listener into
side two. Immediately following
is the catchy little melody of
“Have a.Cuppa Tea.”. Good to the
last drop, I say.

Othe-\r outstanding cuts feature‘—

the bitter grief of the blues-tinged
"Holloway Jail” and the sadly

nostalgic "Oklahoma USA,”(
dreamily drifting along, ponder-

ing, “All life -we work, but life is
a bore/If life’s for livin’ what’s
livin’ for?”

And on the title piece, some

genuine cockney hayseeds (hon-
est) bring it all back home. Char-

the sheer artistry evidenced here A
and in classics like Somethin’
Else have momentarily lapsed
into the throes of Le(a)d Zeppe-
lin heaviness? You really got me
there—for the Kinks are‘ by no
means dedicated followers of
fashion, draped about in current
trends. The band has rather mel-
lowed with the years; indeed, at

Theater °fosters’ tryouts

Fashion will be directed by Pro-
fessor Canfield, University pro-
fessor of Theatre Arts, whose
previous productions of The
Tempest, ’ Marat/Sade, Rosen-
crantz and Guildenstern Are Dead,
and The Time of Your Life have
been greeted with unqualified en-
thusiasm by Pittsburgh" audiences.

Fashion opened in New York in

March, 1845, and made theatrical

history. Its obvious farcical base
supported some_ serious satirical
barbs against the pretentious and
absurdity of the parvenus in New
York society in their attempts to
adopt the airs and attitudes of.
the European capitals.

 "Director Sam Peckiripah‘s Wel-
I./tanschauung is marvelously un-
lfencumbered: a man lays claim to
-iiinanhood. house. and spouse only "

after he has proved himself in an

"I ’jor"deal of violence.

" ' Simple? Certainly.’ Primitive‘?

'— Probably. but Peckinpah has fash-

 ioned.this cro-magnon credo into
....--Straw Dogs, a film now playing

.at the Stanley that superbly and

I compellingly establishes the pass-

",'a_‘ge to manhood as an elbow-deep
‘dip in la bloodbath.

 Dustin’ Hoffman is a meekly lib-
._er_al mathematician who flees

America to the sleepy hometown
of his wife (Susan George). He
would escape there. the carnal
rites of masculinity, but they
stalk him like a posse.

For his is an untested liberal-
ism. a soft-hearted faith in good-
ness. based not so much onhatred
and recognition of evil as on a
vague. pervasive fear that can
only be vanquished in hand-to-
hand combat.

Until he conquers this fear, he
can command’ no respect «from
his wife, who is sufficiently miff-
ed at his precision and prissy
love-making to sulk topless before
the local stiffs, can earn no re-

spect from his fellows, who in-
vade the privacy of his domicile
in response to his wife’s exhibi-
tionism, and can maintain pre-
cious little self-respect.

But tested he will be. As the
ring of violence tightens around
his neck. Peckinpah builds ten-
sion so tangible and stark that the
climactic carnal orgy is an abso-
lutely necessary cathartic for
the viewer as well as for Hoff-

man.

Peckinpah creates a mood of
increasing disquietude. begi/n-
ning with uneasy dialogue be-
tween Hoffman and town pub pa-

,trons..suspended by the symbol- r

ic murder of a cat. and sharpen-

 

ed by the real, mesmeric. slow-
motion rape. spliced with shots
of a bumbling Hoffman out duck-
hunting. . '

For Hoffman, who has of late
swept through films with breezy
bravura, the role of the low-key
prof is a switch, but one that he
performs creditably.

Susan George. because woman
in Peckinpah‘s scheme is more
property than person. has little
more to do then scream and bleed.
But she is decorative chattel.

Peckinpah has been criticized
for championing gratuitous vio-
lence in his work, most notably

in The Wild Bunch. The critics.

picting man warring over hearth

Iln that respect, Peckinpah

was antedated by our hairy pro-.

genitors who clubbed their
women into submission, dragged
them home, and etched their tri-
umphs into the walls. (Interest-
ingly enough, one. of the local rap-

‘  MARTY HELLMAN
Associate Sports Editor‘

Each year the NCAA reviews its position on themiiltitiide

V of rules and regulations governing the member schools’ athletic
8 teams. At the 66th annual convention this weekend in Florida,
-(several controversial amendments will be discussed. ‘' ~

One area of particular interest is the awarding of athletic
scholarships. Two changes will be proposed—one of great merit
and the other of questionable value. '

The first will allow a school to re-
move an athlete_’s scholarship if he vol-
untarily quits a team, while the sec-
ond will permit each school to renew
an athlete’s grant on a yearly basis. ,

The former motion is sorely needed
and years overdue. Until now, an ath-
lete. could contract with a University
for four years of ‘athletic aid, quit a.
team at any point and still receive

' ~ " monetary aid unless he voluntarily
MY-St!”-SK‘ surrendered it. _ '

V No school has experienced any wholesale misuse of ‘schol-
arships in this manner, but even a couple athletes doing this over
a four year period means unnecessary financial burden on the
school. , ‘

Although Pitt Athletic Director Casimir Myslinski would
not reveal actual names and numbers, he admitted that a" few
cases have occurred in the past several years.

“I’m.for the amendment,” stated Myslinski beforehe left

The only remaining loopholein the  A

A‘ quits a team after school starts because the amendment will

permit cutoff of aid after the academic year.

The proposal concerning an annual renewal of aid could be-
come quite deterimental considering the fierce competiton of
collegiate sports. , T ‘ ’

Originally, the four-year pact hindered schools from.i~nvit-
ing large numbers of athletes to school and selecting only the
good ones for permanent positions, similar to pro squads. "

Unless appropriate safeguards are inserted for the athletes, A

coaches would then have the option of cutting marginal players

from the squad by not renewing their grants. (In essence, the  

players would have pro pressures.) ~

Myslinskinfeels that some schools may work the system V

amendment. ‘ _ V. t .

Cats suffer gloomy holidays

Morris the Panthers found the

range. Paul O'Gorek started
at center but the new line-up
hardly had time to establish
itself _before Ridl felt safe
enough to go with the subs.

The Colonials held on for the
first ten minutes of the con-
test. but couldn‘t contend with
the 53 percent field goal shoot-
ing of the Cats. who went into
the locker room at halftime
leading 56-37. The biggest dis-
appointment of the night was
Pitt's failure to eclipse the cen-
t_ury mark 20 minutes later.

The cagers got a taste of how
tough the opposition really is
this year, meeting Wisconsin
and South Carolina back to back,
midway through December. The
Cats traveled to the midwest
where they were thrashed 83-66
by the Badgers, who had only
lost one of their first six games
prior to their contest with Pitt.

Top-ranked South Carolina
kept the Cats outside in the
cold as they rolled to a 69-59
victory over the Panthers in the
Field House on December 23.
The Gamecocks forced the Cats
to shoot from distance and the

ball refused to fall. Jim Bolla
suffered a broken elbow in that
contest and is out for the sea-
son.

Next the cagers turn their
sights on Westminster. who in-
vades the Field House tomor-
row at 2 p.m. It's a special game
for Ridl who coached there
for 12 years.

The Old Spot led from the first
basket until the finish with a 18-13
bulge at the end of the first half.

When asked how he felt about
losing to a team with only four
men, Ferble Phil Fitzgibbons re-
plied, “Bad, from the opening
basket we went downhill.”

A member of the Old Spot com-
mented about the next game when
they willbe a full strength, “Next
time it won’t be so close.”

The scoring for the Old Spot
was fairly evenly distributed

among the four players. Ryan was

the best team in the east with
the exception of Penn State.”
