For last Issue

Faculty members of the Panther
executive. committee leveled their
guns on the risque April “Fac—
ulty Issue” Friday, but gavegno
indication of banning the maga-
zine on campus. _

The board merely recommends.
The publications board takes ac-
tion on the advisory opinions.

Administration criticism of the
last edition, centered on unfavor-
iablepcomments from outside the

members on the racy contents.

._ Panther editors said they could
either put out _the non-subsidized
magazine to favor the_University
or the students. They stated they
couldn’t do the former and end the
year in the black.

Insupport of the claims, Busi-

"ELECTIONS AGAIN

The electorate turnout tomorrow at the women’s twelfth
ﬂoor polls will. probably not match the percentage of voters
at the recent Ellsworth Center elections. The "coeds eligible
to vote outnumber the “Boys Town” students better than three
to one, and the more potential electors the lower the percentage
of yotes cast. .

But the wo1nen’s elections are doubtless more important
to the women thai:i the Center balloting was to the men at

' Shad_\f'side. Even iiex’t,week’s men’s elections do not carr the
Y

weight of the coed voting.
The ofﬁcers the women elect tomorrow pick up some au-

' tliority over their female population of some 1300. Undoubtedly
. Pitt women in general take a greater interestin school activi-

ties. than the sprawling male populace. The coeds exercise their
voting mandate more often and more selectively. They are more

-careful who gets on WVSGA, Student'Congress, who gets that

influential hand toiover them. -

, Most men students allow control over themselves to develop
only to a, semi-classroom discipline and the indirect dealings
they have to have with University administratox-s_ Vvhat Stu-
dent Congress._and Men’s Council does or tries to do is little
concern of theirs. Thatvthey don’t care has been indicated in
past "elections by relatively-sparse turnouts.

Student voting does provide practice and indoctrination

. for men and women to employ in regular governmental elec-

tions. But beyond that, the value of this vote-casting eludes’ us.
The student officers elected by their classmates are at

‘ bestonly guides or helpers for University administrators, at

worst, debating societies. Why go tothe trouble of having stu-
dents select these “aides,” opening the way for partisan choice
of persons who can’t do the job of assisting school officers? It
seems it would be better to let the less-likely-‘biased University
officials pick their own “personnel.”

They have most of the organizations fairly _well hog-tied.
\Vh_v not let them tighten the knots? . ,
Of course,'this is probably_ one time when theory must
be allowed to overbalance practice. We might as -well have this
pseudo-d_emocracy of student -govei.-ning bodies operating for
atmearance and experience’s sake.

Letter To    
The Editor

Editor, The Pitt News:

As an advanced ROTC student,
I would like to add to the letter
to the editor by student Golds-
borogh in the April 5 Pitt News
denouncing the appearance of
ROTC students. This is an open
letter to Mr. Goldsborogh.

Let me first say, Mr. Golds-
borogh, that, in general, I agree
with your opinion. of the Pitt
ROTC. It is a slipshod crew—es—
pecially the basic units. Half uni-

.-formed students are continually

seen in the Tuck Shops and the 10-
cal bars. 1

But don’t attack us too bitterly,
Mr.'G. Afterall, we are working
our way through school the same
as so many young Pitt students
are. We put in one period a day
for ﬁve days a week (including
one day of kneading. the campus),
and we draw our check at the
end of theymonth. Ves, alas, we are
mercenames, .Mr. G. Face the facts.
Before the new pay raise, the Pitt
ROTC Department had to hustle
and scout to snare recruits. Now
they have to hold them back. -No,
Mr. G., we do not care two brass
buttons whether our trousers are
sharp and shiny),

What we do need in the ROTC,
Mr. G., are more men like you. It
is obvious that ‘you are that nat-
ural material that regular army is
made of. You would have the per-
fect military bearing, the spine of
brass. Yes, we need new blood in
the ROTC. Weneed your blood,
Mr. G. '

Music Notes

By ALLAN , BIERMAN

Local Niferies . . .

Be-Bop will have its day in.Pittsburgh. In fact, it will have
a whole week. Last night at the Copa Club, the singing sen-
sation of the Stan Kenton band began holding forth. Naturally
everyone knows its June Christie. Sultry June has been doing
singles since the break-up of the Kenton aggregation. June’s
rendition of “How High The Moon” is becoming immortal to
jazz fans. ’

Blowing hot over at the Carnival Lounge, starting Thurs- ‘

day night, will be one of the greatest bop trumpet men’ in the
land, Howard McGhee. As usual, the Deuces Wild will be dis-
playing their wares.

On the more commercial side,-Ma.rtha'Sh_ort, singing star ’

of “ Inside U.S.A., ”

will be doubling at the Hollywood Show"
Bar. ’ , -

‘Personal Appearances  .
Nelson Eddy will be brought to the Syria Mosque by the

May Beegle series on April 19.’ He is being billed as the great
American baritone.

'Whei"s-qOn The Discs . . . 7 V O -

Nat Cole has come up with another ‘terriﬁc record in “_Don’t
Cry, Cry Baby."’,Tune' is a very infectious ditty with Nat do-
ing some real'gone_voca1izing. Flip-over is a light, slightly

up-tempo tune called‘ “If You Stub Your Toe On A ‘Moon.’-” ’

Thisside has an exceptional instrumental background.

For a ﬁne example of dressing up an old tune take a. ‘listen
.to -“I ‘Got It*Bad’f as done by Woody Herman andthe herd.
A nice piece of chirping is turned inby Mary Ann McCall
on this disc. Reverse side is an up-tempo, slightly bop number
titled_ “That’s Right. ”.Not bad, a-tall. . L
, For those on a Brother Bones kick, “Five Foot.’l‘wo, Eyes
of Blue,” and “Ida” has been released. Of course, some people
like this kind of “music.”

After a six mont-hsu‘of not/ having one release, due to con-r

tract diﬁ’iculties,aSa.ra.h Vaughn has returned to the wax whirl

. with an old favorite, ‘.‘As "You Desirei°Me.” Opposite side is

the new torch song, “Black Coifee.” Both are well-handled.

Frankie Garle, who.._p1ayed”at the Inter-Fraternity spring I

formal last Friday nite, has had another of his records released.

This’ is, ahfairly nice tune entitled “The Little‘ Old Church:

Near Leicester Square.” ’ -

Mittmen Beat Wayne-sbulrg,

Set Sights on

With help from the pitching
arms of Chaneellor Rufus H. Fitz-
gerald and Deryl Calder,‘ and
scorekeepers equal to the task, the
Panther baseball machine got the
1949 season underway with a
complicated '6-0 shutout win over
Waynesburg Saturday and hope
to lower the boom again on tough
Western Reserve this Saturday.

The Yellow Jackets committed
six errors aﬁeld while giving up
only ﬁve hits, to‘ hand the Pan-
thers an easy victory at the Sta-
dium. “ ‘

The only anticipated action of

the day occurred when the open-.

ing toss made by the Chancellor
to Dean Vincent Lanfear blooped
through the air and bounced be-
tween the latter’s legs.

‘Aside from four Pitt errors Cal-
der~ was never in trouble. He
whiffed l‘4 batters, one of the best
totals posted by a Pitt pitcher in
modern times, and gave up only
four hits in facing but 30 men.

He struck out the side twice
Saturday and fanned two each in
the fourth, ﬁfth and sixth frames
to keep things well under control
most of the way.

Whatproved the winning mark-
er was scored in the first inning.
Smodic walked, stole second and

later scored when Clelland booted,

Barnes’ easy roller at second.

From then on it was touch and
go, the Jackets »merely‘ touching
hit balls and Panthers continually
going round the basepaths. '

Due to a lack of spring prac-
tice. both teams were far from
impressive. Waynesburg . coach
Roger Jorgenson said he had been

able to hold only about six out-
door practices because of the “
weather. The J acket’s veteran ’49
team stung most opponents last

Assistant Sports Editor

Staying Shut

This is a column that might be worth reading.

I _say this because, although the topic of discussion will
be baseball, positively no predictions on the baseball season
will be found in the following prose. ’

It is customary about this time of year for sports columns
to issue inside-dope forecasts of howithe home heroes will fare.
If turned, upside down at the end of the season, these fore-.
casts generally bear a closer ire-7%

semblance to stark truth than in
their original pre-season position.
No Risk Here,

The beauty of reporting college
baseball is that the‘ writer need
not even be tempted to risk a pre-
diction. For no matter how much
time he spends watching the base-
ball players practice, he still
doesn’t know what kind of sea-
son" the baseball team will have,
any more than theguy who spends
his afternoons_ in "chem lab.

Why? The season is just too
short. -. '

Ralph Mitterling could have a
team full of home run sluggers.
Yet ‘over the short pace of 20 or
so games, "they could look like a
bunch" of palm-waving chamber-
lains. ~

Slumps Fatal

If three key hitters, for exam-
ple, should simultaneously dive
into a temporary slump, the re-
sults would be disastrous. In a
professional season of 154 games,
such slumps would probably be
counterbalanced sooner or later
by hitting sprees.

College hitters must make it

1 Trio of IF Teams C

Race for Trophy

It looks like a three team race
for the IF all—point_trophy, with
the Phi Gams, Phi Eps, and PiKA
battling it out for the coveted
cup.

The Phi Gams are in the top
shot with a_140 points. In second
place with 115 points is the Gam’s

biggest threat, the Phi Eps. The.

Phi Eps won the crown last year.

The Phi Eps jeopardized their
chances of repeating by failing to
place in football competition.

They have come around strong,

though, in recent weeks, placing
first in basketball and swimming.

‘They are also expected to retain

the IF softball title.
The Phi Gams, on the other

' hand, while only taking one ﬁrst
spot, have placed in every event

except bowling. With a ﬁrst in
football, the Garns have placed
no .lower than third in other com-
petition.

A second in badminton and bas-
ket ball, with thirds in swimming
and pingpong have given the

Garns the breakaway advantage. .

Not to be counted out, how-
ever, is‘ another “runnerup” out-
ﬁt, PiKA. The PiKA’s have not
won one event, but are still in
third place with 1071/2 points to
their credit. -

'The same goes for pitchers. A.
steady chucker may work ﬁve or
six games over the season. He’s
got to have that fast one-working
right from the start; and’ if his

curve insists upon waiting for
summer ‘weather before' it will
break, then Mr. Pitcher is well
on his way to a thankless season.
Thus, to predict the outcome of
a college baseball season is to walk
a mighty shaky tightrope. When
you fall (and the odds are strong
that you will), you land in a sick-.
ening net of I-told-‘you—so’s.

‘some more. “How much?” asked Joe.
Still only 10¢ for 4,” said the clerk.
That's when Smudge fainted.

' “What?” said Joe when he came to,

“Why I pay twice that for blades
that aren't half as good.”

P.S.: Don't be fooled by price. Try
Pal Hollow Ground yourself. You
still get 4 for 10¢, 10 for 25¢, 21 for
