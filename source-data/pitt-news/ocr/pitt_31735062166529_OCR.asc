Englanders Contend
Small States Rate,
Win in WPDU Debate

by DONALD E. LAMIPERT
“In spite of the fact that the mouse roared, it still didn't ‘affect
the decisions of the larger -states." This assertion was made by
Harry Tuminello as he attempted to defend the proposition that
“The opinions of small nations are irrelevant.”
This debate was held under the auspices of the William Pitt
Delbate Union Tuesday in conjunction with the visit of a team of

debaters from Great Britain.

The British debaters or as they -preferred to be known, “The
Representatives of the English Speaking Nations of Northern
Europe (one was I-rish and one British), successfully opposed the
proposition of Tuminello and his partner, Victor Papale. Both
Tuminello -and Papale are political science majors at the Univer-

sity.

The successful speakers for the opposition were E. William

Smythe, a Dublin barrister and

recipient of numerous awards
for debating, and Michael Tu-
gendhat, a participant in vari-
ous campus organization at Gon-
ville and Caius College, Cam-
bridge.’

Tuminello asserted, “The opin-
ions of small nations are irrele-
vant to the concern of major
-states and therefore irrelevant
to the world itself.” Tugendhat
argued that this view was in
error because it saw only crisis.
“What makes a state important
is the -situation around it,” said

_ the British delegate.

Speaking next, Papale called
upon the audience “not to con-
tinue to ignore the opinions of
the Ridgeway-s, the Goldwaters,
and the Joe Bynes.” He warned
them “not to take Dean Rusk
for granted.”

His call to chauvinism was
denied by the Dublin barrister
who said, “You can’t deny his-
tory, faet, and international re-
lations. Small nations have

sparked great events.”

Tum~inello’s conclusion ‘brought
an adverse reaction from the
audience and the opposition was.
supported over two to .-one in
the ﬁnal vote.

SG Senate Discusses NSA;
Establishes Study Committee

by PAUL STOLLER
(See editorial, “A Question
of Motives,” page 4)

An amended bill concerning
Student Government (SG) affili-
ation with the United States
National Student Association
(NSA) was passed Wednesday
night by the SG Senate.

The original bill stated the
following:

> It is in the interest of the
SC to join a national students’
organization.

> The NSA is the largest and
most representative student or-'
ganization.

by TONI GROSSI

Have you ever wondered what
people do with. that extra hour
on Saturday night when the
clock changes from Daylight
Savings Time to Eastern Starri-
dard 'llime? Well, Associated
Women Students (AWS) has de-
cided to sell it.

At the rate of one cent a min-
ute, AWS will sell one “free”
hour to the University's dorm
coed-s this Saturday night. “Pen-
ny Night,” instituted under the
guidance of Vicki Rashbaum,
first vice-president of AWS and
chairman of Wom-en’s Housing
Board, -is to raise funds for the
United Nations Children’-s Emer-
gency Fund's (UNICEF) tradi-
-tional Halloween drive. .

“We rationalize our decision
on three counts," stated Miss
Rashbaum, “the spirit of Hallo-
ween, the change from Daylight
Savings Time (old time) to East-
-ern Standard Time, and the
UNICEF Drive. Halloween. and
UNICEF just ﬁt right in, with
the time change providing a
unique way of collecting con-
tributions for a really worth-
while cause.”

Women dorm students usual-
ly have a 1:30 am. base curfew
and 2:30 am. maximum curfew
on Saturday night. This Satur-
day will theoretically be the
same. The official change from
“old time” to EST is at 2 pm

Committee Presents Ideas
For Orientation Revision

The Student Government (SG)
Freshman Orientation Evalua-
tion Committee reported the re-
sult of six weeks work Wednes-
day to the SG Senate. The re-
port was accepted by the Senate
and will be forwarded to Dean
of Student Affairs Jack Critch-
ﬁeld.

The committee outlined the
basic philosophy of orientation
and made suggestions for the
-improvement of the freshman
orientation at the University.

The report states that the pur-
pose of a, Freshman Orientation
is “to help incoming students
understand the University be-
fore the University can realize
their full poten v .”

An accurate orientation should
include three aspects, the first
of which is academics-. Cln this
ﬁeld, the group strongly urges.
that freshmen be informed of
the academic programs avail-
able, instead of having stress
put in the graduation require-

 

 

ments. This can be accomplished
through a joint effort by fac-
ulty, the advising centers of the
undergraduate schools, and se-
lected upperclassmen.

A second aspect of the plan-
ned onientation pro-g.naJm -must
“provide the freshman with the
opportunity to become better
acquainted with the University
community. To acheive this, he
must be propertly welcomed to
the University by administra-
tion and faculty members, a
well as by upperclassmen. He
should become familiar with the
history and tradition of the -Uni-
versity, “realizing that «it not
just another college, but that
it possesses its own unique iden-
tity,” according to the report.

The incoming freshmen -should.‘
also be informed‘ of both Uni-
versity and communities activ-
ities, as well as the entertain-
ment opportunities of the city.

The group recommends the

(Continued on Page 6)

ﬁrst two meetings of the newly
elected Senate.

Senator Vic Willem opposed
the original resolution. He sub-
mitted to the Senate an amend-
ment calling for the creation of
a. study group to research into
the following:

> An evaluation of the ad-
vantages and disadvantages of
pertinent student govermne
associations. -

> To recommend that the SG
of the University join one or a
number of the most useful or-
ganizations.

>To suggest the best way to
intergrate such a national or-
ganization with our campus.

In presenting his amendment
to the Senate, Willem stated the
“issue needs much more study.
There is no clear picture of the
NSA at - this time.”

Willemls View was -retorted by
Senator Loren Hershey, a spon-
sor of the original (unamended)
bill. Hershey explained that the
NSA could assist the SIG with
its problems concerning the
Book Center and Freshman 
entation. “These are all prob-
lems on this campus,” stated
Hershey.

Hershey said that there were
“tremendous opportunities in
joining the NSA. It w’ ,” said
Hershey, “put the students on
this campus into a large dialo-

gue betwen students all over the ‘

nation.

Willem ended the debate on
the NSA amendment resolution
by stating that he was “most

cautious about joining the ‘NSA. ' 

He revealed that the “NSA had
created a shadow SG at Mount
Mercy.”

12th F loor’ 3 Mother

 

Clara Renders Long Service

“by SHERYLL ZIPPAY

Clara has thousands of
children, not to mention the
grandchildren. “I just love
students,” she says. “They
are just like my own chil-
dren to me. When they mar-
ry they bring their children back
for me to see.”

Duri-ng the 20 years that Clara
has served the Cathedral's 12th
ﬂoor as -cook, she has seen gen-
erations of students enter and
leave the University. She greets
them all with the same cheerful
smile and kind words as she -did
when she ﬁrst began her job.
She is tremendously proud of
the fact that she “never tires of
young people.” « ,

“I believe -in treating young
people right,” Clara declares
emphatically. And the Univer-
sity students and faculty have
responded to their “mother”

away from home” by making.

her an honorary member of Quo
Vadis and Thyrsa Amos. A spe-
cial delight to Clana is when the
members of the Men's GileeClu1b
come up t-o the 12th floor to
-cook. "I just direct them,” she
says as she beams her infectious
smile. She is also an honorary
rnernber of the Men’.s Glee Club
and bakes for them when they
go on tour.

Clara is as strong a Universi-
ty tradition as any you can
name. She has a wide acclaim
for her pecan rolls and is said
to make the best fudge in the
world. She was taught to cook
by Savina. Skewis, dean of wom-
en; who believes that “all wom-
en are potential homemakers.”

“Clara,” Miss Skewis added,
“knows how to do things cor-
rectly at the right time.”

Clara ﬁlls the mother role in
other Ways, too. She constantly
welcomes students to the 12th
ﬂoor to experiment with cook-
ing or just look around. For in-
stance, she directs candy mak-
ing sessions around holiday sea-
sons so that students can make
homemade candy for celebra-
tions. She is also Willing to lis-
ten to any problems the girls
bring to her and tries to offer
helpful advice. “The 12th ﬂoor,”
she stresses, “should be a home-
away-from-home for all Univer-
sity students.”

Clara can pull many amusing
memories from her practically
endless experiences. Last Lan-
tern Night, for example, it was
discovered that Father Pitt’s
lantern had no candle. Clara
came to the rescue and within
an hour had concocted a can-
dle in a freezer so that the “light
of truth” would be able to shine
for the new freshmen.

Once when -she was organiz-
ing a dinner for 75 people all
the stoves mysterio-usly turned
themselves off. What did Clara
do? “I just-laughed -and turned
them back on,” ‘she said. Clara
has also had to teach how to
make ice water ( someone ‘actual-
ly didn’t know). One of her fav-
orites, however, is the giﬁl who
was a straight “A” student and
didn't know how to tell lettuce
from cabbage.

Clara has also been a featured
speaker -at many Mentor meet-
ings. Speaking -of the mentees,
she says, “They're all my little

darlings.” The Mentors often
take their group-s to the 12th
ﬂoor to have Clara direct a cook-
ing session. The girls leave with
the satisfaction of a good time
and the feeling of gaining some-
thing more than an acquain-
tance with pots -and pans and
cooking skills.

During her 20 years of Uni-
versity service (which she pre-
fers to term as just “a long
time”), Clara has rejuvenated
many organizations who were
almost out of existence. If you've
ever met her, you know how
she does it.

 

Area Residents Study

At University of Hawaii

Two former Pittsburgh residents, Miss Jane A. Fer-
guson and Richard G. Fallon, are now working at the East-

sity of Hawaii.

The East-West Center is a -bi—cultural program which
engages American and Asian students in Paciﬁc or Asian

area studies. Grants are avail-
able for postgraduate studies
ranging from 18 to 24 months,
with the American -scholarships

“Structure your lives in a way

Duquesne University, when he

Tuesday evening. “Don’t go

Von Eckartsberg calls our so-
ciety a “golden cage” contain-

Trains Still Run in Panther Hollow C°“te“d""'S

by IVAN ABRAMS

Most Oakland residents,
accustomed to the constant
rumble of trains, give little
thought to the railroad
track that runs through
Panther Hollow at the edge
of the University campus.
But new arrivals to the area
are frequently awakened in
the middle of the night by
the deep howl of airhorns
and the seemingly — endless
rumble of a long freight train
on the old line of the Buffalo,
Rochester, and Pittsburgh (BR

and P), now part of the Balti-
more and Ohio Railroad (B&O).

The tracks in the Hollow were
put down -in the ﬁrst decade of
the 20th century as part of the
Pittsburgh Junction Railroad, a
link between the B&O on the
Monongahela River and the
newly-«constructed BR and P on
the banks of the Allegheny.
Within ten years the BR and P
had assumed control of the Pitts-
burgh Junction, and long freight

and passenger trains were us-
ing Panther Hollow as the first
step in their passage north to
Lake Ontario.

The Buffalo, Rochester, and
Pittsburgh ‘linked the Steel City
with the industrial and port
cities of Western New York.
During the business boom of
the 1920’s, ore from the Great
Lakes boats was loaded ‘into
hopper cars ‘at the port of Buf-
falo bound for the mills of Pitts-
burgh. Finished steel from the
mills was put in gondolas and
sent North to become automo-
biles, refrigerators, and stoves.

The BR and P also carried
passengers. It was possible, un-
til 1958, to take a passenger
train from Pittsburgh to Du-
Bois, Pa., to Olean, N. Y., to
Salamanca, N. Y., and to Buf-
falo and Rochester. All the trains
passed through Panther Hollow.

The passenger trains of the
BR and P were not the shrunk-
en, moribund conveyances of the
majority of today’s railroads.
Instead, the trains carried the
latest in Pullman sleepers, coach-
es, and dining cars. The trains

may not have been fast, but
they were luxurious.

With the coming of the de-
pression, the Buffalo, Rochester,
and Pittsburgh fell on hard
times. The tracks through Pan-
ther Hollow became weed grown
one-ﬁne passenger trains were
discontinued. To all observers,
through disuse and most of the
BR and P was dying on -its feet.

However, World War II
brought new strength to the
American economy, and all rail-
roads, including the BR and P,
prospered. After the war, the
Baltimore and Oho, which had
always held a major share of
the BR and P stock, bought up
the remainder and made the lit-
tle railroad an integral division
in its Pittsburgh region.

While the last scheduled pass-
enger train through Panther
Hollow was discontinued in 1958,
the old tracks have been any-
thing but idle. The Hollow linie
forms -a vital portion of the
B&O mainline to Chicago. While
all of the B&O- passenger trains
use the tracks of the Rittsburgh

“Pa¢e4—-THE rrrr NEWS— Frlday,0ctober27,l967

Editorial: A Question of Motives

A bill calling for our Student Government (SG) to affiliate with
the National Student Association (NSA) was defeated in effect at Wednes-
‘day's SG meeting. The bill in its original form was amended to call for
the establishment of a study group to evaluate the advantages of not only
NSA but the other national organizations of thlis nature.

After the vote was taken, three PPP senators, who had enthusias-

” tically endorsed the original proposal, walked out of the meeting, a move

reminiscent of the Senate of two years ago, when PPP senators employed

such tactics to either show their disapproval or to assist them in perform- 7

ing a particular political maneuver.

The initial bill stated the following: “The Senate shall nominate
and elect an NSA coordinator who will be responsible to the Senate. The
first election for the NSA coordinator would be held on the night of the
passage of this bill.” The speciﬁc nature of this clause makes us question
iii" this is not a thinly disgused attempt to launch a candidate for next
year's SG presidential election. The sponsors of the bill had a deﬁnite can-
didate in mind for the position, and when they saw their measure was go-
ing to be defeated, one senator went up to the SG president and expressed
his willingness to compromise: Frederick could nominate the pe-rson him-
self, as long as it would be the person the sponsor wanted.

Joe Kocuibes, a junior in the School of Liberal Arts. The tactic of creating
a post so that a student might advance his political career is a maneuver
reminiscent of a recent anonymous, mimeographed newsletter, which dis-
cussed members of SG in highly derogatory terms. We reiterate that the
newsletter was anonymous, and whoever the author was, he obviously
did not have the courage of his convictions to sign his name to his charges.

We deplore the use of such cowardly tactics. Those who have risen
to positions of leadership in student politics in recent years have tradition-
ally been responsible people. They did not stoop to the level of inventing
organizations and positions so that they might establish a power base in
order to launch a political campaign. Rather, they moved through the es-
tablished lines of student organizations and advanced on thisbasis. V

We admonish those who are considering high positions in next
year's SG that they will be judged on the basis of their contribution and
open actions in recognized student organizations. And this is rightly so,
for the responsibilities inherent in student leadership positions require
that students be willing to defend their beliefs openly to effectively meet
their obligations. No amount of political maneuvering can carry student
leaders through the year. If they fear repercussions for defending their
Vliews, they cannot begin to fulﬁll their duties. A coward at the helm will
only retard the efforts of those students who are sincere and forthright.
It is too big a risk to take.

The person being advanced for the position of NSA coordinator was A

They are the authors of
the new credibility gap. They
were present in the march on

like them, are one of the
main reasons why the con-
ﬂict over the war has not
yet substantially reached the
middle tlass. Demonstrators
like these in Berkeley, who
actively sought conﬂict with
police, and demonstrators
like those who stayed behind
in Washington repel the vast
majority of the American
people.

They have created their
own credibility gap. They ar-
gue and scream that the
crowd was 25,000 when aerial
photographs and seasoned
reporters place. it at one-
tenth that figure. They
claim to be paciﬁsts, while
they support the likes of Che
Guevera.

THEY KNOW, beyond a
shadow of a doubt, that they
are right. They don’t, like
mature dissenters, argue
that he is a warmonger, a
butcher, a fascist, a sadist,
or any other repulsive cliche‘
they can think of within
their warped minds.

Until they are purged by
responsible leaders of the
Peace Movement, it can nev-
er hope to achieve legitimate
status. Until that day comes,
the vast majority of the
American people will have
nothing but disgust and pity
for the marches.

N 0 Laughing Matter

by Dan Lichtenstein

PITT FOOTBALL is now at the point where we find
it hard to take it seriously.

Last Saturday at halftime, I told my date that for the
next game, I’d bring a flask full of Scotch to deaden the
pain. By the third quarter, most of the crowd in the student
section was cheering Miami scores more than Pitt first
downs. By the ‘fourth quarter, any remaining weak cheers
for the Panther gains were drowned out by the laughter
for their mistakes. What's next, black arm bands when
Nptxg Ramp argiyesg -~ ------, mum allll uauus wnen

In the last few weeks, a lot of bad things have been
said about the football team, bitterly, humorously, and
otherwise. An editor can berate the administration for not
keeping a football program consistent with the opponents’
or he can decry the lack of student support (which does
exist at least for the first quarter of each game). But there
is also something good to be said about the football team,
something good about the athletes themselves.

No one is saying we have eleven All Americans out
there They all do have athletic ability, or else they would
not have thousands of dollars worth of athletic scholarships.
But they have more than just strength and agility; they
have minds, with feelings, hopes and courage.

THE PHRASE, “A tearful losers’ lockerroom” is not
just a melodramatic cliche. While the student body specu-
lates on ‘how much the Panthers will lose by on each Satur-
day, the players continuously say, “We can beat them.” Pitt
has ‘had losing seasons for three years now, but in each and
every interview with the individual players appears the
quote, “We can win on Saturday.” Just check issues of The
Pitt News for the last three years. Check t-he feature on
Mickey Depp in Wednesday's issue. It is not easy to lose on
Saturday when every other day they honestly believe they
can win.

Nor is it easy to even go out there every Saturday
throughout a season like the current one. The Panthers are
known nationally as “patsies” and “doormats.” But they
still go out every week and try to disprove the names they
are called. They don’t go out and try their best every Satur-
day, because if they did, they would not be losing by so
much. But no one has quit the team either.

And the Panthers have courage in another sense too.
When a team gets whipped by the likes of UCLA or Miami,

, they get beaten physically as well as statistically. Just be-

cause an athlete is playing does notmean that he is not
hurting. When the press clippings say a certain linebacker
is playing with a badly bruised hip, they mean he is playing
tackle football with an injury that would keep most people
away from classes for days.

THE PANTHERS are all individual students as well
as athletes. They are not a blue and gold machine that is
taken out of storage and wound up every Saturday morn-
21ng. Don’t pity them, they don’t want com.passion. Respect
them, they have earned that. .

I sang my harp on the sunﬂs deck

Here at the water in the cool unblossomed year,
And the light notes clung at my hair roots
Like bird cries gathering.

All the day's time leaned

Into lengthening shadows

And moments clung like fresh leaves
On water.

Wind crossed the pond

Leaving stripes and crosses _

As though it rolled and-cast down,
Cast down its shape for vision.

Wisteria hung for lavender
In a blossom of perfume,
And on the stone a toad
Settled in sunlight.

Is this saturation of senses,enough?
Living together between a time frame,

We creature and non-creature
And I among them.

addition of a Fund Day and the
opening of the Field House and
swimming pool to introduce the
student to the recreational facil-
ities of the University.

Upperclua-ssmen form a major
part of the orientation program.
The pamphlet states, “the up-
perclassmen will be an impor-
.-tant source of information and
offer a different perspective of
the University that presented by
administration and official hand-
book.

As a ﬁnal suggestion, the com-
mittee feels that orientation pro-
gram should be handled -by the

office of the Dean of Student

Affairs, rather -than the SG.
“This Will serve -to -unify the
various phases of -orientation
and make one person responsi-
ble for the =entire program,” the
report emphasized. “The com-
mittee feels that this could pro-
vide the organization so badly
lacking in previous -orientations.”

PHI ETA SIGMA

This year Phi Eta Sigma,
freshman men’s honorary fra-
ternity, Will extend its tutor-
ing to the entire University.
Anyone wishing to tutor may
do so if they have an “A” in
the subject they wish to teach.

Anyone interested in becom-
ing a tutor in this program
should apply in person in the

UNICEF is an agency of the
United Nations. It _is concerned
exclusively with the “welfare of

However, there were still mil-
lions of children in economically
underdeveloped cowntr-ies who

were “hungry, sick, and ne-

UNICEF's life for three ‘years.

by WALTER GRANT
and PHIL SEMAS
WASHINGTON (CPS)-Well
over 100,000 demonstrators who
came here Saturday to call for
peace in Vietnam were met at
the Pentagon by about 2,500

Federal ‘troops armed with clubs.

and riﬂes, some with bayonets
-attached.

The troops and US marshals
used -clubs and tear gas to hold
back the demonstrators who
broke through police lines in an
effort to reach and enter the
Pentagon itself.

More than 400 persons were
arrested. Some were injured and
carnied away from the Pentagon\
with bloody faces. Several hun-
dred more received minor in-
jursies.

About 20 demonstrators ac-
tually made it inside the Penta-
gon, but they were quickly
thrown out by troops waiting im
side the doors. About 2,000 peo-
ple sat on the long porch along

the North wall of the Pentagon.

Saturday night. Military police
were removing them one-by-one.
Another 2,000 supporters re-
mained on the mall below.

Late Saturday night one MP
defected to the demonstrators.
He put down his gun and walk-
ed from his position in the po-
lice Lliines. Many of the demon‘,-
strators had talked with the
troops throughout the day try-
ing to get them to put down
their arms and join in the peace
movement. They cheered when
the MP defected. The Defense
Department did not conﬁrm the
defection but it was witnessed
-by at least one newsman. 4

There were wide discrepencies.
in the estimates of the number

‘QOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

of demonstrators. The Defense
Department claimed there were
about 30,000 to 35,000 and police
put the ﬁgure at 55,000. But it
was obvious there were well
over 100,000 people at the dem-
onstration, and leaders of the
National Mobilization to End the
War in Vietnam said there may
have been -as many as 200,000.

There were enough demon-
strators to ﬁll the large Pentax
gon mall, with enough left over
to ﬁll more than one-third of the
huge north parking lot. The
peace march started at the Lin-
coln Memorial at about 1:30
p.m., and marchers were still
ﬁling into the Pentagon, park-
ing lot at 6 p.m.

A large group, led by two
men with crash helmets and
loudspeakers, charged a line of
about a dozen MP’s in the south-

west corner of the parking lot. ,

They broke through the ropes
which were holding them ‘back
just as two dozen more MP’s
came racing around the corner.
Several demonstrators were ar-
rested, including the two hel-
meter leaders, and I'lO'VelJl~St Nor-
man Mailer. Later Saturday

night, Dave Dellinger, chairman
of the Mobilization Committee,
was also arrested. '

Troops pointed their bayornets
at the demonstrators who gath-
ered peacefully in front of them.
After ‘about ﬁve minutes, they
were ordered to unsheath their
bayonets. The demonstrators
were still standing peacefully
when this order was given.

After about ten more minutes
of pointing their naked bayonets
at the crowd, ‘the soldiers were
ordered to take the bayonets off
their riﬂes. The Pentagon claims
that no bayonets were unsheath-
ed and that they were always
carried in an upright position,
never pointed. -

Several incidents occurr
when demonstrators later tried
to charge up the steps toward
the Pentagon porch through the
police lines. Police fought the
demonstrators back with clubs.
The military police seemed to be
satisﬁed with merely holding
their lines, but federal marshals
brutally ‘beat some Olf the march-
ers with their clubs.

On several occasions, two or
three marshals continued beat-

Politics (NCNP) Tuesday.
The conference, held in Chi-
cago this summer, attempt-
ed to create in 13 resolutions a
structure for radical politics in
Ame.rica.

Frank Goldsmith of the Viet-
nam Summer Committee and
Joseph Burke of the Allegheny
Atlliance lauded the results of
the NCNP. Thomas Checkley
and Earl Harris, botlh of the
Pitt Law School, condemned the
conference.

Goldsmith stated that despite
early failures and poor organiz-
at.ion, the Chicago convention
shows promise to the future of
radical politics. The New Po-
litics movement began in 1965,
but its decision ‘board was pre-
vented from deciding how the
funds of the movement should
be distributed.

The movement, therefore, was
ineffective at that time. Today,

M Goldsmith stated, the 24 man de-

cision board, half White and half

Negro, has complete control
over the allotment of funds.
’l.‘he board, Goldsmith continued,
is made up of conservative and
militant people, and shows great
hope for the future of the move-
ment.

Burke was more philosophical.
He stated that he was originally
attracted to the conference for
this -support of the anti—war and
anti-Johnson stands. However,
the racial issue, which had the
largest support at the confer-
ence and in the 13 resolutions,
"tells us where we are,” Burke
stated. There would have been

no need for the resolutions if

the anti-Vietnam and racial in-
terest groups could have gotten

together in the first place. The

point of the conference, Burke
con*tinu-ed, was to -see how whites
and blacks can sit down and
talk to each other.

Oheckley criticized the NCNP,
because, he stated, the anti-Viet-
nam and civil rights interests
had nothing in common. Both
groups, therefore, went away
from the conference without ac-
complishing anything. 'Ilhe res-

The True Story

 

Time To Judge Panther Football Disaster

by GEORGE LIES
Associate Sports Editor

The laughter, previously con-
ﬁned to a darkened corner where
coaches from Penn State, West Vir-
ginia, and Carnegie Tech sat, had
now reached a pitched roar in the
courtroom.

Frank Carver, not smiling now,
and Dave Hart, his head bowed, sat
at the defense table; they waited.
As the judge entered, the laughter
subsided. Then the judge banged his
gavel and spoke. Let the trial to
judge Pitt football begin.

. The Prosecutor stood; as my ﬁrst
wi‘tness, I call a university student.
Tall, lean, and wearing glasses, the
student recited the oath and began

. his story as the Prosecutor had ask-
ed. Sir, I am a senior. I enrolled
here because I thought it was one
one of the best schools in the coun-
try; not only for an education, but
for extracurricular activities. I knew
it had a reputation for good foot-
ball teams. But in 35 games since,
my team has won eight. Now, I’m
not like my other friends who go
crazy w'hen they lose. But why me?
Why do I have to be the one? When
I go home, people laugh. They see
that your team got beat, '58-0. They
point their ﬁnger, and then they
joke. I’m ashamed. I’m embarrassed.
I don’t want to tell people I go to
Pitt. I

Thanking the student, the Prose-
cutor called to the stand, a very in-
ﬂuential alumnus. Sir, your story
please. Yes . . . when I went to school
here, we had good teams and we
had a good coach. I know this isn’t
so now. Yet, I know a lotta high
school football coaches who would
do anything to coach here. They’re
ﬁne ‘coaches, too. They’re winners.
I know I’m impatient, but losing
football teams is not good for me.
It hurts my business. People say,
he’s a Pitt man. He’s another loser.
I’m sorry, but that’s my story.

the court of everyone except the

The next witness, a member of
the faculty, was asked if he liked
football. Well sir, I’ve been here for
six years. I remember winning. I
remember the football players who
kept this school on the sports pages
of the New York Times- I would like
to see another winner. I know I don’t
make the rules, and that I must
abide by the school’s policy, but I am
a professor. Don’t forget either, I
give out the grades and I still want
to win. Thank you, the Prosecutor
said.

Now your honor, before the De-
fense rebuts this case, I would like
to question three more witnesses.

The ﬁrst is Beano Cook, the for-
mer sports publicist here for many
years. Beano, what’s wrong with
the game here?

What’s wrong, blurted Beano.
Everything. Pitt wants to play ma-
jor college football. But listen. They
don’t redshirt because of a dumb
agreement made with other Eastern
schools. They don’t give enough
scholarships. And they don’t sched-
ule any breathers. Yea, I know I
didn’t get along when I was here,
but that Johnny Michelosen was a
good coach. I just wish he had
Hart’s drive and personality. Hart
has proved one thing, he can recruit.
Hart still has to prove he can coach
on the ﬁeld. If you ask about Car-
ver, well . . . he’s a victim of cir-
cumstances. People blame him, and
they shouldn’t. He takes orders
from above, and his job depends on
whether he carries them out, right
and legally.

Thank you Beano. Now I would
like to call Captain Tom Hamilton
presently the National Director of
Athletics and formerly the Athletic
Director here. Why did you leave?

Sir, although I would like to say
more, and because of my position, I
can _only say one thing. Here, I

couldn’t be the boss. We had our
ups and downs as a football power
then, too. But when I couldn’t do
what I wanted, I resigned. That’s all
1 can say. '

Lastly, your honor, I would like
to call on a man who is well known
around the country. He doesn’t hold
a big olfice, in fact, .he’s been around
Pitt, it seems, forever. He’s their
top rooter and his name is Horse
(jzarnecki. Mr. Czarnecki, is it true
that for the ﬁrst time you’ve been
here, you told Mr. Carver, the de-
fendant, you actually rooted for the
other team to score with 30 seconds
remaining in the Miami game? I
know you would not answer the
question, but you must.

Well . . . sir, it is true. For the
ﬁrst time, I was really down . . .
I hated to lose like that.

The Prosecutor thanked Mr.
Czarnecki. Now your honor, I shall
turn the proceedings over to the
Defense. I

Your honor, the Defense calls
Frank Carver to the stand. Mr.
Carver, you hold two offices in the
ECAC, what is your stand on red-
shirting and recruiting?

At last fall’s meeting, we had a
tough time of it, but we held on
redshirting. I know recruiting is
necessary, but I cringe everytime I
see a newspaper photograph of a
high school boy signing his name to
a letter of intent But I feel that giv-
en the right amount of time, Pitt
will be ‘okay again. Is that all, Mr.
Carver? Yes, it is.

The Defense now call Dave Hart
to the stand. The clerk held the bible
as Tart took the oath. For the bene-
ﬁt of the court, the Defense asked
him to state his name and occupa-
tion. My name is Dave Hart and I
am the head football coach at Pitt.
Suddenly, here was a commotion. A
roar of laughter broke out. Bang-
ing his. gavel, the judged cleared

press. But before one gent left the
room, he yelled, Hart you couldn’t
win if your life depended on it. The
judged banged his gavel again. al-
lowing Hart to continue.

His head still bowed, Hart spoke.
Your honor, right now we are in a
bad situation. I don’t know if it is

‘my fault, or whose fault it is. Be-

cause when you lose, everything
looks bad. You be-gin to point the
linger at everything. I don’t know.
I knew this was a big job when I
came here. I was the one everyone
looked to; I’m supposed to save Pitt
football. It seems I let everyone
down. I don’t know. There are ex-
cuses, but they become sour grapes
after awhile. In the East, everyone
looks to Pitt for leadership. If Pitt
wins, the East looks great. But if
Pitt loses, critics snub Eastern foot-
ball. Presently, Pitt is losing. But
just wait, the East will have its
leader again shortly.

Thank you, Mr. Hart. Your hon-
or, the Defense rests, and awaits
your verdict.

Coldly, the judge asked the de-
fendants to please rise. Sirs, it is my
duty to pronounce sentence. There-
fore, I must.

For you Dave Hart, I sentence
you to two years probation in your
present capacity. If at the end of
those two years, Pitt football is still
laughed at, you will be tried, and I
assure you, convicted of being a con-
ﬁdence man who used friends and
the general public for his own good.

For you Frank Carver, although
you are a victim‘ of circumstance, I
say to you, if Hart does not fulﬁll

his promises, you will be tried for ,

betrayal by all those who respect
you and your decisions.
For you see gentlemen, it doesn’t

matter how you lose, or how you_
win. The fact still remains, Pitt des--

perately needs a winning football
team. Thank you, and court dis-
missed.

HAWKS LOOK SHARP
Yesterday, the Pitt News
Hawks held their second prac-

shaded the defense, 24-18.
Highlights of the scrimmage
were TD catche.s of Dan

stalwart blocking of Hobie

team that defeated the booters,

that six or seven sophomores
are on the starting team, re-
placing seniors from the team

year.

Coach Bemis commented that
he watched these sophomores
play on the Bucknell frosh team
last year when they defeated
the Penn State frosh booters,
and he thought they looked bet-

Bucknell is coached by Craig

tomorrow at Forbes Field. Trexler, scoreless this year, scored
eight goals as a freshman.

4 PiKa Wins Close Game;
Phi Ep Takes Delta Sig

Four touch football games were played this week by
fraternity teams. In the games, Pi Kappa Alpha outlasted
Sigma Alpha Epsilon, 18-12; Kappa Sigma smashed Theta
Chi, 25-6; Phi Epsilon Pi trounced Delta Sigma Phi, 28-0; and Zeta
Beta Taau edged Phi Kappa Theta, 15-6.

In the P-iKa-SAE game in League “B,” the winners scored

ﬁrst, midway through the ﬁrst
half, on a 15-yard touchdown
pass from quarterback Bill Clay-
poolle to Tom Smith.

The lead didn't last long, as
SAE took the kick-off and march-
ed on a touchdown drive climax-
ed by a 20-yard TD ﬂing from
Rich Andolina to Bob’ Snyder.
This tied the game at 6-6.

This deadlock was broken on
the last play of the first half.
Claypoole ﬁred his second TD
pass of the game, giving PiKa
a 12-6 lead. The aerial was
caught by Stan Pulchowski.

Each team scored one touch-
down in the ﬁnatl half. PiKa’s
TD came on «Claypoo-le’s third
six--point pass. Mick DiIo;rio
caught this one. The Andolinva
to Snyder combination glave S-AE
their ﬁnal score, on a 40-yar
TD pass. ’

SAE had a chance to win late
in the half. They got the ball
with 1:30 left in the game. How-
ever, they couldn’t move the
ball and were forced to give it
up. PiKa took over and ran -out
the clock.

Another “B” game between
Theta Chi and Kappa Sigma saw
Joe Diederich of Kappa Sig
score four touchdowns. There of
the TD’s came on passes from
quarterback Larry Lesniak. The
other one was a result of a kick-
off return by Diederich.

The losers scored their only
points on a ‘pass from Warren
Nystrom to Rich Sicilliano.

In “A” action, Phi Ep’s win
over Delta Sig was the fourth
shut-out in four League _“A”
games played.

Danny Friedman scored two
touchdowns and Art Villa and
Danny Katcher scored one TD
apiece for the winners.

The «string of blan-kings in
“A” was ﬁnally ended on Wed-
nesday with ZBT’s win over Phi
Ka:-p.

ZBT’s tallies came on passes
to Tom Geiger. The ﬁrst one
was thrown by Steve Mirkin.
Bo-b Ziff ﬁred the other one.

Phi Kap’s only TD came on a
second half pass from Bo Ricci
to Dave Stack. The loss elim-
inates Phi Kap from the tour-
ney. '

YOGIS SEEK BARBER

The “Hawk” was prepared.
He carried a shaving mug and
a sharpened razor wherever
he went. “N 0, I’m not going to
the Hill after dark,” he ex-
plained. “I’m going to shave
the “Moustache.”

The “Hawk” was referring
to none other than. George
“Moustachio” Lies, who, by
some streak of blundering,
dumb luck, now leads the Yogi
contest. “Moustachio,” known
far and wide (but not in Pitts-

burg) for his suave manner,
only commented, “The Hawk’s
a bum.”

Others were trying to shave
the “Moustache” in different
manners. Linda “Beulah”
Goldstein, now runnerup, was
using her bookie sheet un-
abashedly in an effort to get
the lead.

“I have to win something,”
said the Big Wind, still dis-
appointed at her failure in the
Homecoming Queen contest.

Jay “Flatbush” Rosenstcin,
still buried in last place, spent
the week trying to butter up
his teachers, so as to salvage
something from this year.

Playboys,
Madhouse
Grab Win

Dorm football action Tues-
day featured two high-scor-
ing contests. Mad House
trounced the Peanuts’ Gallery
for its second win, 37-6, and
Playboy's Penthouse shutout
Keystone, 22-0. Plea-sure Palace
won on a forfeit over Haw-
thorne.

Don Lomba-rdo’s aerial bombs
sparked the Madmen to victory.
He hit Fred‘ Foust with a 25-
yard pass in the ﬁrst period for
the ﬁrst score of the game. Lom-
‘bardo then ran a twopoint con-
version. He made the score 14-0
in the same quarter with a 35-
yard touchdown pass to Steve
Twitch.

Julius Ne-cciai returned a punt
55 yards for a second quarter
touchdown. A pass conversion
made the score 21-0. Lombardo
then threw TD passes ‘to Nec-
ciai .in the third peniod -and Pete
Neglia in the fourth period to
close out the scoring. Both
touchdowns were followed by
two-point run conversions. Quar-
terback Dave Atcheson ran the
‘ball over for Peanuts’ only
score.

Dick Shore and Larry Illion
sparked the Playboys’ win. Illion
took a ten-yard pass from Shore
for a first-period score. A pass
conversion was made by Frank
Pastor.

After George Varmartino
-scored on a short pass from
Shore in the second period, 11-
lion took -a four-yard pass «and
ran for the Playboys’ ﬁnal score.
Robert Freschi ran for a co-n-
version. Shore had passed for a
conversion after Varmartinds
TD.

Canisius Invitational Offers
Severe Test For Thinclads

by ART ROSENGARTEN

BUFFALO, N. Y. — The
site of Saturday’s cross
country competition for
coach Jim Banner’s varsity
and freshmen harriers.

Over 20 teams will run‘ in the
Canisius Invitational.
Last year, the d-istancemen ﬁn-

ished second among 22 teams, ,
but coach Banner doesn't expect I

as strong a showing this year.
A good deal of where the team
ﬁnishes will depend upon the
performances of Roger Holly
and Jay Jansen.

“Holly and Jansen haven’t run
in a big meet and where we
ﬁnish depends upon how these
boys come through,” said Ban-
ner. Banner looks for strong
performances from senio-r Paul
Zink, junior Ken Lawton and
sophomore Paul Zink,

With over 170 runners parti-
cipating, the secret to a good
time, according to Barmer, is
how well each boy gets off the
starting line and how he avoids
the crowd. Banner looks for
tough competition from last
year’s winner, University of To-
ronto, and another Canadian
school, McMasters University.
The top American competition
could come from Bowling Green
University.

The undefeated and unscored-
on freshmen team looms as fav-
orites to capture the Freshmen
Invitational crown. Asked about
being a pre-tournament favorite
Ban-ner «said, “We will take them
one at a time and see What hap-
pens.”

For the fresh, tlhi-s Will be the
ﬁrst big meet. The freshmen
squad is led by Jerry Richey.
Richey is undefeated this sea-
son and has set new freshmen
records almost every time out.

Other members of the fresh-
men squad, which has consis-
tently run better times than the
varsity, are Greg Rodgers, Mike
Nolan, John Crozier, Brill Mata.-
jasic, Jeff Wilson, and Mark
Vornhagen.

Next week, the harrriers run
at University Park against -Penn
State.

Please don't
zlupf Sprite.

It makes

plenty of noise
all by itself.

Sprite, you recall, is
the soft drink that's
so tart and tingling,
we just couldn't keep
it quiet.

Flip its lid and it
really flips.
Bubbling, fizzing,
gurgling, hissing and
carrying on all over
the place. , I .

An almost exces- '3,‘
sively lively drink. - -‘ 

Hence, to zlupf is I I‘ ‘K:
to err. "

What is zlupfing?

   
 

Zlupfing is to drinking what
smacking one's lips is to
eating.

It's the staccato buzz you
make when draining the lastfew
deliciously tangy drops of
Sprite from the bottle with a
straw.

Zzzzzlllupf!

It's completely uncalled for.
Frowned upon in polite society.
And not appreciated on campus
either.

But. If zlupfing Sprite
is absolutely essential to your
enjoyment; if a good healthy
zlupf is your idea of heaven,
wel1...al1 right.

But have a heart. With a
drink as noisy as Sprite, a
little zlupf goes a long, long
way.

Fearsome End

 Midshipme11 Sail Rugged Course;
Cartwright-Taylor Naval Battery

by MIKE BROURMAN A
Looking around Navy-Marine Corps Memorial Stadium,
the Penn State player was awed by the names etched into

the gray concrete block. “Tarawa . .

. Guadalcanal . . Oki-

nawa,” he whistled. “Man, you guys sure play some schedule.”
Tomorrow, the Middies leave their hallowed home ground .to

meet the Panthers. But the fact
that «they are on the road is of
little consolation to Panther
fans. The Navy has never been
weak when they are on strange
ground.

 is borne out by the Mid-
dies past few games with the
Panthers. The gridders have not
triumphed over the Naval Acad-
emy since 1961, and four of
these games have been played
on Cardiac Hill.

The year, the Middiest bring
in a. puzzling aggregation to try
and extend that record. Navy
has beaten Penn State, Michigan
and Syracuse, but has lost to
Rice and William‘ & Mary.

The exrplanvatio~n, according to
assistant frosh coach John Ros-
enberg who scout-ed the Middies,
is one of spirit. “Other scouts,”
he explained, ‘‘told me that when
Navy came out in the second
half of the Syracuse game, they
were like a bunch of wild men.
AgaJinst William & Mary, they
were just casual.”

Navy handed Syracuse a stun-

   

   

   

, ‘wan about that. ‘

ning 27-14 defeat, then lost a
16-0 lead to William & Mary,
eventually losing 27-16. “It’s pos-
sible,” said Navy coach Bill
Elias, “that We were looking
ahead.”

Ahead to who? That’s the
question Panther fans want to
know. Next week the‘ Middies
play Notre Dame. Could they be
overlooking the Panthers for
that game. “I don’t think so. Not
after last week,” said Elias.

If the Midshipmen are up for

this game, they -could be an,
awesome foe, at least o1‘I"ensive-,

ly. John Cartwright, the quar-
terback, is a deadly thrower and
he has «some «excellent receivers
in Rob Taylor, Roland Laurenzo
and Terry Murray.

Cartwright has completed 64
passes already this year, and
Taylor has grabbed 34 of them.
The lanky split end “has -the
knack of coming up with tihﬁt
big play,” -said Elias. Murray, a
shifty -runner Who has had two
200d games against the Pan-
thers, grabbed -six against Syra-
cuse in a reserve role. He may
«start tomorrow.

The ground attack is led by
Jerry Balsly and Cartwright,

I who excels on the rollout. Bals-

ly is Small, as runners go, but
he hits hard and has good speed.

The Navy defense is small,
quick, and tough as usual. They
are also vulnerable, and this is
unusual. The Middies have giv-
en up better than 21 paints a
831719. more points than they
used to allow in a season.

There are some ‘standouts,
however. End Bill Dow was a
pre-season All-America choice,
and ‘halfback Rick Bayer has
Picked off four passes. In addi.
U011. the Panthers can expect a
blitz, designed to confuse the
young offensive line.

“They didn’t blitz against W11.
liam & Mary,” Rosenberg sa,id_
“They’ll probably blitz like crazy
against us though.”

And. when Navy blitzes, the
results can be disastrous for
thear foes. Just ask -the J aps on
Tarawa, Guadacanal, and Okina.

JEFF BARR is expected to get the starting nod at quarterback to-
morrow. The lanky sophomore from Canton, Ohio,  considered
a ﬁne runner. He will have to cope with the Middies blitz, however.

AllSophomoreBackfielcl
Starts Against’ Middies

by GEORGE LIES
The Panthers’ white hats have become tarnished by the
likes of UCLA and Miami. No longer can one feel optimistic,
expecting an upset of the bad guy.

Tomorrow at 1:30 pm. in the Stadium, the Panthers battle .

Navy, and the underdog Jungle Cats are without their top good guy.
Bob Bazylak, who started this year as the number one quar-

terback and. who then practiced

as the number two wingback, b

only to lead the Panthers over
Wisconsin as the number three
quarterback, is out for -three
weeks with a broken ankle. He
may be ready for Penn State,
Nov. 25, though.

It’s the third in a. series of-
breaks going against the Cats.
Dave Hart calls it “snake bite.”
He’s seen his number one full-
back,‘ John White break his
hand on the very first offensive
play of the season. A week later,
Hart saw Greg Keller, his mid-
dle linebacker, break a. bone in
his right leg on the first play of
the Ilinois game.

“I guess I'll go and sit with
Keller,” joked Bazylak, Wednes-
day when the cast was removed
and then replaced «again. With
Bazylak gone, Hart once again
turns -to his ﬁrst choice as quar-
terback, Jeff Barr and Frank
Gustine.

Although Hart was undecided
which one would start tomor-
row, -he did favor Barr. “He’s a
heady sort,” remarked Hiart.
“He’s intelligent.” Gustine, ac-
cording to Hart, is still the best
pas-ser of the two.

“With Baz out, we must re-
vamp our entire offense,” Hart
said.

Against coach Bill Elias’ quick
Navy team, Hart starts a com-
plete sophomore backﬁeld. The
second team backﬁeld is three-
fourths -sophomores; only jum-
ior Skip Orszulak is listed at
wingback.

“Where other teams start one
or two sophomores, here we are
starting seven on offense,” Hart
said. “Those sophs on other
teams usually are playing next

-to -a senior; that -guy can de.

pend on the one with experi-
ence.”

Offensively, the Panthers now
Show only two seniors. Bob Lon-
8'05 who has caught 20 passes

TERRY HOOVER
Defensive Ca.pta.2'n

for 261 yards this season, is at
split end, while Ray Radakovich
starts at guard.

“Sophomores make those lit-
tle mistakes, -and they cost -us
toulchdowns,” explained I-Ilart.
“But we don't have a leader of-
fensively; someone who will set-
tle the youngstens, and encour-
age them.”

Defen-sively, Hart lists only
three sophomores, Bob Ellis, a
6-2, 212 ‘pounder, at right end;
Ed Sadovwskri at linebacker; and
Dave Dibbley at defensive back.

“Dibbley
seniors out there, and he does
a ﬁne Jo ,” Hart pointed out.
Then thoughts of next season
with three vacancies in the sec-
ondary popped into his mind.

Paul Killian, Mickey De-pup,
and Joe Curtin -graduate aﬂter
the Penn State game next month.
Hart Ihopes next season he won't
have to say that “those little
mistakes our inexperienced sec-
ondary makes costs us touch-
downs.”
