Groups Not Interestedln  
Carnival, J arrell Says’

By HARRY

LEWINTER

The three fraternities recently barred from participating

in Spring Carnival apparently

are not interested in the Car-‘ *

nival at all, according to Kent. J arrell, president of SGA. The

Alpha.

_fraternities are Delta Tau Delta, Phi" Epsilon Pi and Pi Kappa

Jarrell presented this opinion at Monday’s meeting of

SGA when the carnival situation0-

was discussed. “They ‘had the op-
portunities to, take action in SGA,
but they didn’t,” he said.

A The question arose, “Why
should we be concerned with this
matter”? Has any memberof the
fraternities approached any SGA
member with an appeal?” The an-
swerwas unanimously “No.” » -

In answer to why there was’

no appeal, someone said, “Per-
haps they were afraid that a
more severe penalty would be
imposed, such as social proba-
tion.”

In return, Jarrell posed this
hypothetical case. “If the fraterni-
ties had come to SGA and_ we
overruled the decision ‘handed
down by the IF Judicial Commis-
sion, the administration (Dean of
Student’s Ofiice) would most like-
ly ask SGA’ what alternate pen-
alty we would impose. «

“The administration only ‘ap-
proved the action of the IF to
ban the fraternities from the car-
nival, although’ they weren’t ac-
tually concerned with this ruling.
They "then enforced the decision
of disciplinary probation which
was suggested by IF_. .

“The responsible’ members of
the fraternities didn’t have the
initiative to "ask “the administra-
tion for reconsideration. But, I
suppose its easier ‘just to sit
back and take the easy way
out,” Jarrell added. ,

“Serious thought should have
been given to the consequences

that would develop concerning the '

women’s groups, Kappa Kappa

“They had a moral obligation to
them to try and get back into Car-
nival, just as the fraternities and
sororities who are still in the Car-
nival have a moral obligation to
make this the best Spring Carni-

val ever."

perfection before they are al-
lowed independence.

In .discussing various areas of
Africa, Mboya illustrated that
there were vastdiiferences among
them. The west coast, for ex-
ample, has not been subject to
the influx of European settlers as
has the East. The aim of the na-
tionalist, in these areas, too, is to
place no discrimination against
the white colonials, but to give‘
them equal rights.

Mboya stressed that the nation-
alists were “dedicated to the non-
violent action,” though determined
to win independence. They hope
that the European powers will co-
operate to establish democracy in
Africa. ‘

In relation ‘ to the United
States stand on African prob-
~ lems, Mboya was unable to ‘un-
derstand why this country would
not support their struggles as
well as thepeoples of countries
like Hungary and Tibet. The
African “ people. feel that the
United States comprises its prin-
ciples in altering her stand, on
them’ out of deference to her
all" ~ ' " W v- "

SGA Not Sure _ i
What It Waiits

From Judiciary

The Student Government
Association, on Monday, ap-
proved the duties of all their
standing committees except
one, the Judiciary Committee.

The SGA members could not

agree on the specific functions
which were suggested at their
orientation meeting at Wildwood
last Sunday. V .

The Judiciary Committee, in
their recommendations, w o u 1 d
have the power to control and:
establish uniformity in the eligib-
ility of students who want to par-
ticipate in student organizations
and. activities. a -

Another duty of this commit-
tee would be to provide for a
judicial system to enforce SGA
action by establishing a student
court.

Ann Abbinanti, Arts ’61, made
a motion that provided the com-
mittee with powcrs “superior to
all other student judiciary bod-
ies.” _

The Judiciary Committee would
be able to review and prepare’
the cases appealed to SGA with
the understanding that SGA is
the court itself and would have
ﬁnal say, -that is until a student
_court is established.

A Her motion was defeated and
subsequent discussion on this
matter was tabled until next
week. The group did abolish the
Civic and Cultural committees.
_The Tap Day Committee, head-

ed by Fred Whittier, Arts ’61, was

granted an additional $50 for the

needed funds for .the program -

next Monday.

John ‘Strauch, Arts ’60, and Ann
Pongratz, Arts ’60, were selected
from the student body to “repre-
sent SGA on the Student Affairs
Committee.

The decision of whether or not Tap Day is to be ‘con-

'« This year’s Tap Day Committee, headed-by Fred‘Whit-

event possible. Because the chairman ‘was appointed three
weeks late, the committee had to work double-time to com-

‘and prospective tappees. The committee, conﬁdent of stu-

Awaiting Publication. ,t'

By Ina Amdur

For many years interested groups of students
-have tried to publish a literary magazine at the
University. This goal has ﬁnally been achieved.
A student-written magazine of the arts entitled
“Ideas and -F-igures” ‘is now in the process of being
printed. -

This magazine will be published three times a '

year and will accept contribu-
tions from any undergraduate

or graduate student . attending

the University. “Ideas and Fig-

ures” is looking for many types

of writing and for art work.

Short stories, poetry, book re-

views, plays, and articles on

music andarcliitecture are all

welcomed.‘ _ - 4 A

A magazine of this type is

certainly a necessity f5r a college which is attempt-
ing to improve its academic environment. Creative
ideas must have some outlet for expression or

they soon stagnate. Aspiring writers‘, of which‘

there are many in the University, need at ﬁrst a

non—professional_ publication which will accept-
their writing. This experience, if they have the

necessary talent, may, enable them to publish later
in a professional publication.
Two Separate Magazines

The staff of “Ideas and Figures” insist that it
does not intend to encroach upon areas covered
by “Manuscripts,” a literary magazine now pub-
lished by the English Department. The latter mag-
azine selects the best work of certain English stu-
dents who have achieved distinction in advanced
writing classes.

This magazine then becomes the showplace for
work of Pitt’s justly famous program for writing
majors. From time to time contributions of stu-
dents‘ outside these English classes are published,
but usually the contributors accepted are those who

 ‘Ideas anc|tFigure's'  . as

have adhered strictly togtenets of advanced writing
classes‘. ‘ '
The University has room for both magazines.

.“Ideas and Figures” is designed to cover writing

about all the arts. It will also be an outlet for
many student authors who have had no formal
connection with the English Department since their
freshman course.
Overflow of Material

The new Board of Editors has been ﬂooded
with poems and short stories which are not of
class room origin, and they have announced that
these contributions have some real literary merit.

Because there has been no other magazine except"

“Manuscripts,”.much of this work has never had
a chance to be printed, and the aspiring authors
have had no encouragement. . .
The new magazine does not ‘yet have an editor
but an editorial board consisting of four students.
This allows a wide range of literary tastes to be
exhibited which is necessary for thistype of pub-
lication. There were many contributions for the
May issue all of which were of surprising profes-
sional quality. ' -
-The co-operation of the students has been
whole—hearted and there was too much material to
be published in the first issue. These results
demonstrate more than anything else that there is
a need for another magazine. The only way that

 

this need can be shown on the part of non—con-"" A

tributing studentseis in their willingness to support
a magazine. It will be sold forthe price of a stu-
dent directory, 50c.

The first issue of “Ideas and Figures” will ap-
pear ‘early in May, twoweeks after the appearance
of “Manuscripts.” -

Let us make sure that when it goes on sale it
does not :meet with apathy on the part of the
student body. “ldeas and Figures,” if it receives
the necessary» support, can be.a valuable and last-
ing’ institution in the University’s academic life.

 

By Richard Johnston

Tom Mboya gave a very in-.

formative talk in the Student
Union on Monday as part of the
Midday Series. He dwelt on _pro-

. blems of Africa and of the great

C struggle which

t h_i s . struggle
was one against
, colonization and
-- European domi-
nation of. the
economy. He condemned the do.-
mination for resulting in an un-
diversiﬁed e c o n o In y within

 

Africa and‘ allowing the stand-

ards of living to remain at a
low level. In fact, European. do-
mination was blamed for all the
troubles faced by the people of
Africa. * , ~ E . '

Mr. Mboya reasonedthat un-
less an African government is
directly responsible to the Afri-
cans it governs and not to a
colonial power, it can.not‘take
care of the problems faced in
that continent. He then came up
with quite a shocker.
Points‘ Out Fear

He stated that Africans should .

not have to explain or defend

r theirright to self-determination,

and that it is completely unnec-
essary for African ,_ leaders to
guarantee a democratic govern-
ment after the foreign powers

‘ move. ' out."

__ Mr. Mboya derided people of
democratic countries a s k i n g
about the future ‘forms of gov-
ernment because he felt these
modern’ democracies, did not al-
ways have a high standard of
democracy. - ,

What he thought really im-
portant was that all Africa

should be freed at once, with-‘
out regard to the type, of local ‘
" __rican government that might -
_r“e ult’.,g_g “ ’ ‘   ‘ 

h i H

pointed out that‘

 
   

An Independent Africa . . .

 A Sword in Our Side  

pointed out one of the worst
fears of the democratic nations.
This is that the political sta-
bility of Africa‘ is so shaky that

not even the African leader can ‘

predict which way the political
winds will blow.

. Leaders’ 'Aims .

Are such leaders ready to be
entrusted with the future pow-
er over millions of native Afri-

cans and hundreds ofthousands‘

of Europeans now living. in
Africa? It is sometimes unclear
whether’ these African national-
ists really want dem-ocracy and
respect for the ‘individual; or are
they- hungry for the power and
possibilities of economic exploi-
tation now available only to the
Europeans? _ .
Certainly some of the new
Africanindependent states are
not clarifying the situation.
’ Thus, in mostof them,‘ the
case seems to be the same -graft
and" corruption but led by new
faces. Mr. Mboya didn’t go into
much detail of just how the Eu-
ropean colonies would be treat-
ed after independence is achiev-
ed. He did call these “immi-
grants” just a “bad problem.”
It is known, however,‘ that Mr.
Mboya is contemptous of any
minority right these people
might have. He is an elected
member‘ of the Kenya legislature

but refuses to attend because the .

representatives are apportioned
equally between‘ the white and
African; population. ‘

At ﬁrst glance, his criticism .

of 14’ representatives for 60,000

whites as opposed to the same ~

number for six million Negroes
appears to be justified. This,
however, would seem to be the
only way the minority rights of
the Europeans could be protect-
ed against the majority desires
of the Africans.

Economic lniulstices

In ‘the present situation,

neither segment can work eﬂec- .

tively without the cooperation of

the other. In lcountries ‘where

iwhites after native Africans take‘

control of the government.

This thinking, only in terms
of majority rights, is character-
istic ‘of African nationalists at

.the present time. They preach,

the popular brand of democracy,
not the rational brand‘ of give
and_ take that we Americans

iknow to be n_ecessary for a

healthy existence.

In closing, Mr. Mboya‘ seemed
to give two veiled threats. One
was that if cooperation was not
soon. forthcoming from the colo-
nial powers, the people might re-
sort to violence against the “im-
migrants.” Secondly, he said that
if the U.S. would not give moi;
aid in the struggle, the African
nations ‘might become disillus-
ioned and turn to Communism
for more rapid results. This cry

' has been heard many times be-

fore whenever a foreign leader
is trying to gain popular support
for his people.

Africa does not seem ready for
self-government, b e c a u s e the
Africans ‘cannot control their
leaders or themselves. An Afri-
can block of independent nations
would be nothing but a sword in
theﬁ,side’_’of the free world, cut-
ting and‘ crippling’ it with de-
mands for’ aid. Can this situation

gaged in or ‘can another more

SGA Retreat

Reviews C080
A o’ o o ‘ ’ ’
Jurisdiction

The Student Government Asso-
ciation held an orientation meet-
inguat Wildwood last Sunday to
aiquaint new members with their
responsibilities and discuss the re-
organization of committees.

After brief introductory ,re-

marks by President Kent Jarrell
and introduction of members pres-

-ent, the meeting broke up into

small groups to review ‘the or-
ganization of the various com-
mittees.
topics are the possible elimination

5.01 the Civic and Cultural commit-

tees and the review , of COSO’s
jurisdicition.. ‘ _

At the reconvening of_ the gen-
eral meeting each group presented
their opinions on the problems and
an open discussion was held. Since
this meeting was purely orienta-
tional, no decisions were reached.

After a brief recreational per-
riod, during which the members
indulged in a softball game that
ended in a tie, the group again
met for dinner. Some old mem-
bers had been invited, and after‘
the banquet they led a discussion
on the past record and the'fu=
ture of SGA. ‘ I

Woody Turner, in commenting
on “What’s wrong in SGA,”
stressed the lack of communication
between" students, administration,
and SGA. Hefelt that the repre-
sentatives should be more active
in feeling out the students’ needs
and have the courage to move into
new areas. _ _

John Strauch commented that
“SGA should be made the apex of
all student activities.” He dis-
cussed what can be done in SGA,
emphasizing the responsibility of
SGA representatives. He sug-
gested several problems he felt
SGA might consider. '

J a r r ell, in commenting on
the meeting said, “I feel we have
been most successful in creating
enthusiasm among the members
and acquainting them with "SGA.
We are looking forward to a suc-
cessful year.”

For African

I nde pendenee

(Continued ;from Page 1)

When questioned at the coffee
hour about whether Africans
would accept aid from the USSR,
Mboya ‘said this would be the
case “only if no alternative was
available.” Mboya also stated that
once capital from sources was ob-
tained, some economic planning
would be necessary, but this cer-
tainly does not imply orthodox
socialism.

When‘ questioned about the
possibility of a formation of a
United States of Africa of some‘
sort, Mboya agreed that this was
a goal of the future; meanwhile,
several regional federations are
being affected. —

Talking, about . education in
Africa, Mboya stressed the sever-
ity of this problem. -Here again-
the noted progress can be best
obtained by establishing a free
state. A

Leads Panther

Schoeppner Takes .454  Marki

Into Indiana Teachers Twinbill ’

One of the main problems

that confronted Bobby Lewis’

— Jungle Cat baseball team at the outset of the 1959 season was

to ﬁnd a capable replacement for shortstop Jim Dunlap, the

Panthers’ leading hitter for the

past three. campaigns.

George Schoeppner, who lettered the past two‘ seasons at
second. base, appeared to be the logical choice to ﬁll the gap,

and off his performances in the¢
in the
Panthers’ ﬁrst three games, it is

done any better.

The 5-11 senior from Mt. Leba-
non leads the Jungle Cats in
‘hitting with ﬁve hits in eleven

of .454. He also leads the squad in

due to a home run and a triple

“Schoeppner,” Coach" Lewis
said, “has been the one player
that has been besieged with
more tough luck than any other

Pitt. Last‘ year he was troubled
throughout the season with in-
‘juries and just couldn’t seem to_
get started.

“He was a bit worried about his
failure to hit and came to me
early last season for advice. All I
could tell him was to stay with it
and the base hits would soon start
coming his way. _

“George continued to sparkle in
the ﬁeld but still had his troubles

the tail end of the year he whis-
pered tome, ‘Coach, don’t you
think it’s about time that those
started coming my
w‘ay?” Lewis related.

_Th_ird baseman Jerry Matule-
vic and Leftﬁelder Nick Kart-
sonas have identical averages

. of .375 with three hits in eight
trips. First baseman Ron Maser
and Rightﬁelder Hermany Joy

are both hitting the ball
.333 clip. ‘

Centerﬁelder Bill Kaliden has

ata.

«yet to collect a hit in ten _trips to

the plate while Catcher Fred De-
Lost has a .200 average, but Sec-
ond baseman Pete Colangelo and
reserve outﬁelder Paul Stolitza
are .even lower with identical
marks of .167. ‘

The team average for the Blue
and Gold is .268 as compared to
the opposition’s, low mark of .184.
The Panthers downed Syracuse
twice but lost to Virginia in their
three games to date this season.
(They played Westminster at New
Wilmington yesterday.) -

Lewis has. - nominated Bill
Hamilton and Bob Conti, both
righthanders, to face the Indi-
ana State Teachers in a double-

header _at Wildwood on Satur-’ ‘

day._ The ﬁrst game will start
at 1 p.m.

“Originally these games were
supposed to be played at Indiana,
but their new ﬁeld isn’t’ quite
ready yet so their coach asked if
they could’ switch the games to
Pittsburgh,” Lewis announced.

Skyscraper U.,edged the Indians
by a 4-3 score last season. The

Panthers’ probable batting order‘

will be Colangelo-—2B, Kartsonas
—LF, Schoeppner———-SS, Maser-
1B, Kaliden—CF, Joy-——RF, Ma-
tulevic —- 3B, DeLo_st—-C, and
Hamilton and Conti—P. It is also
quite probable that Stolitza will

game. '

For-Stiff Time
In pPenn Relays

By JACK SMITH

“The competition should be the
greatest ever,” said Coach Carl
Rees of the Penn Relays that the
Panther trackmen will be compet-
ing in this.Friday and Saturday in
Philadelphia. '

On Friday Rees will enter -a
team for the ﬁnals of the distance
medley, which consists of a 440,
half, 660, and mile runs. John
Christoff and Ron Rush have been
named to run in the 660 and mile,
respectively. Dan. Kanell will
throw the discus in the ﬁnals Fri-
-day. Trials for the ‘880’ relay will
also be held Friday.

Saturday the ﬁnals" for the shot
put, broad jump, half—1nile and
mile relays will be conducted. Mel
Barnwell, Jay Moody and Zinne-‘
ford Smith have been nominated
for the. mile relay with a fourth
man to be picked from time trials
being conductedthis week.

Men for the 880-yard relay
will also be picked on a time
trial basis. Barnwell most like-
ly will compete in the 880-yard
relay along with his mile relay
chores and 100-yard dash that
is a featured event of the aft-
ernoon.

In ﬁeld events Ed Vamoswill
enter the broad jump and Larry
Och will throw the shot.

“Considering we had a few boys
sick for a week I feel we are
coming along ﬁne,” - Rees said.
“Our mile relay team has a ﬁne
chance of winning. But it will take
a lot of doing to place in the mile
or- 880-relay with teams like Abi-
lene Christian -and SMU compet-
1ng.”.

The Panther golf team consist-

On the bright side of things it
appears_a's if the Panthers have
come up with a new ﬁrst st.ring
fullback. Jim Cunningham has re-
placed Fred Riddle at the full-

very good on his running and

number one spot.

Another happy note for the
