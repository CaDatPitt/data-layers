Election reflection
Professors, students reminisce

by Kyle Kramer
Staﬂ Writer

The people have decided.

More than 130 million Americans -

voted, or 64 percent of the 
voters, and ultimately elected Sen. Ba-
rack Obama as the next president of
the United States. ’

Just two days after Election Day,
Pitt students and professors are an—.
ticipating what the next four years will
bring

AlthoughObama’svictorymatched
expectations, the election still presented
some surprises, said Pitt political sci-
ence professorjonathan Hurwitz.

Obama’s acquisition of the popu-
larvoteinthree swingstateswas one
such surprise. According to Hurwitz,
Obama had been expected to carry
Pennsylvania. Until the election, how-
ever, a win ir1 Ohio was uncertain.
Obama’s latent Victory in Florida fur-

ther cernented the Democratic candi- .

date’s success

For Obarna supporters following

’ the elections from a frenzied Demo _

cratic  headquarters, such
surprises deepened the camps conﬁ-
dence, according to Pitt College Dern—

ocrat Vice President Lana Stet: Stec
said, “Everyone freaked out’ ’ at the
Obama headquarters after yet another
unexpected win in Virginia

 has since become the sub-
ject of some controversy. Since Tues-

 

day, politigll blogs have been plastered
with claims of  irregularities and
lost votes According to Hurwitz, such
claims should prove inconsequential
because the popular vote leaned “a little
bit closer’ ’ to Obama than expected

‘These types of stories only carry
traction in close elections,” said Hur-
witz.

Amidst these Election Day sur-
prises, the Pitt College Republican sup-
porters of Sen.]ohn McCain only saw
their expectations realized, according

to the group’s president, Pat Graham

“Nothing really shocked us,” said
Graham. “We had our hopes, but we
pretty much expected what would
happen”

-Another development on election
night was the surge in turnout, which
was a “modest surprise,” said Hurwitz.

State representative Dan Frankel,
D—Squirrel Hill, on the other hand, said
Pitt’s voter participation was unprec-
edented.

‘We anticipated a huge turnout, but
nothing like this,” said Frankel, stand-
ing among the lines at Soldiers & Sail-
ors Memorial. Frankel added that the

 stations had not been designed

to handle such voter volume
Hurwitz said the  turnout was
a symptom of Obama’s successful
political strategy Obama campaigned
heavily in states such as Indiana, Vir-
ginia and North  but not nec-
essarily to change voters minds
“Their best chance wasn’t to con-
vert voters but to increase turnout in
general,” said Hurwitz. ‘‘It’s a strat-
egy that was effectively exploited by
Obama”

Councilman Bill Peduto marchesto his own drumbeat

by Lindsay Carroll
Se/zit}/‘ Staﬁ’ W/rite/‘

City Councilman Bill Peduto
wanted to conduct a political experi-
ment _

After working as chief of staff
for his predecessor, former coun-
cilman Dan Cohen, he thought it

’ might be his turn to run forofﬁce in

2001. .
“I ran under the promise to my-
self that I would do everything that
I thought was right, even though it
may be politically wrong,” said Pedu-
to. “I was just going to be’ me, I was
going tovote the way that was right
and let the chips fall where they may.

And it was almost like a political ex-
periment” I

Peduto represents Pittsburgh’s
eighth district, which includes North
Oakland, parts of West Oakland, g
Shadyside, Bloomﬁeld’ and Squirrel
Hill.
In 2004, Peduto made a plan for the
future of Oakland, which included
ideas to make the area pedestrian-
fnendly and expansive. I

He worked with Andrew Zins,
owner of Cafe Sam on Baum Bou-
levard, to plan development for the
Baum and Centre Avenue corridor
in North Oakland.

Zins, whose restaurant has been

‘on Baum‘ for 22 years, said that

Peduto’s goal of diversifying the area
considered everyone involved.

“I think he’s guided by a sense
of what’s right for the community,
regardless of any political conse-
quences,” said Zins '

Pedutoiwent against some com-
munity members when he led an ini-
tiative to ‘build Schenley Plaza.
“There were people that were very
upset about the loss of parldng,”
said Peduto. "‘If you look at it now
and say, ‘OK, we’re going to tear it
down and build a surface parking
lot,’ I think people would cause a
revolution.” . ' I
Pedutosaid he wants to “green-up”
 even further by putting

trees on Forbes Avenue and mak-
ing it as pedestrian ftiendly as Fiﬁh
Avenue. He said the neighborhood
needs a new public transit route in
order to grow —— and plans with
community input ‘ .

He said students should have more
say in City Council decisions, even
though primary elections occur dur-
ing Pitt’s summer break. ,

“In Pittsburgh, _elections are deter-
mined in the primary. And by the
time second or third week of May
comes around, the Towers are emp-
ty,” said Peduto. “If students were to
stay, or if they were to register and
do a strong effort for absentee ballot,
the voice of students would become

Schizophrenia linked to

part of brain, Pitt says

by Hayley Grgurich
Se/2£o_r Staﬂ Writer »

“Schizophrenia” comes from the Greek
words for “split mind” — an idea Pitt re;
searchers have taken literally in a newly
published study of the disease.

In their dissection of the disease, its
development and the manifestation of its
symptoms, Pitt neurology professor Bita
Moghaddam and resident Houman Ho-
mayoun honed_in on a section of the brain
previously overlooked in studies of the dis-
ease.

The orbitofrontal cortex, a section of
the brain located just behind ‘the eyes, is as-
sociated with cognitive functioning.

In particular, this region is thought to be
involved in assessing courses of action and
their outcomes with respect to positive or
negative consequences. '

Moghaddam and Homayoun identiﬁe
it as an area worthy of additional experi-

imentation afteristudying what parts of the

brain lit up in images taken during subjects’

experience of schizophrenic—like symp—V'

toms."

Contemporary knowledge of schizo-
phrenia implicates two neurotransmitters
in the disease: dopamine and glutamate.

Because networks of these neurotrans-
mitters are active during the manifestation
of the diseas‘e’s symptoms, current phar-
macological drugs work by regulating and
stabilizing their activity.

By observing how approved medica— _

tions that act solely upon dopamine affect
the brain, as opposed to more experimental
drugs that target glutamate, Moghaddam
and Homayoun noticed that activity in the
orbitofrontal cortex responded equally to
both types of medications.

Since a single cause of the disease has
yet to be identiﬁed — a number of dispa-

rate factors are thought to play a role —.
‘the discovery of a region that responds to

multiple types of treatments is heartening.

Moghaddam said she hopes their find-
ings will lead to increased interest in study-
ing the orbitofrontal cortex as well as the

potential for the development of novel ,

treatments down the road.

An unusual career path

Although Peduto was always interested in
politics, he didn’t ﬁnish his political science de

He left Penn State University with three '

Peduto, who has criticized ‘Mayor Luke Ra-

contributions are often used as leverage for fa-

“I’ve been in politics for over 20 years, and
I’ve been in city government for nearly 14,” said
Peduto. “I’ve never seen the culture of pay—to-
play as prevalent as it is

maining courses,” he said.
“It’s probably not the usual
path.”

He said that the strategy also aided in converting

Obama’s strength laid in his ability to make

 EDITORIAL   

Pa. voters correct to vote

When Pennsylvanians went
to the polls on Tuesday, they not
only elected a president and state
and local officials but also did

Z well to cast their votes in favor
, of the state referendum, allow-
ing Pennsylvania to borrow $400
million to improve its water and

t sewer systems.
Shortly before the election,

g state officials had received re-

0 ports of high amounts of total

1 dissolved solids, or TDS, pres-
. ent in part of the Monongahela
River.

The initial response by the

. Department of Environmen-
4 tal Protection was to encourage
. customers who get their water

from the Mon to use bottled wa-
ter. But obviously, this is only a

: temporary solution.

According to the Pittsburgh
Post-Gazette, several of Penn-

psylvania’s old water and sew-
} age treatment plants are simply

unable to provide the cleanest

water. The answer, then, is to re-

vamp the system. The $400 mil-
lion will not only repair the water

; and sewer systems, but will also

help control runoff from storm

‘ water, lessen pollution and tackle

the negative consequences of

’ farm chemicals.

By placing the issue on the
ballot, election officials put the
matter and the power in the
hands of Pennsylvania residents.

But the benefits of a ballot

’ referendum can easily be dimin-

ished if the referendum is con-
fusing or poorly worded.
This was a problem on Tues-

'day, when voters were asked

if they “favor the incurring of 
indebtedness by the Common- ,
wealth of $400,000,000 for grants 
and loans to municipalities and §
public utilities for the cost of all 
labor, materials, necessary opera- 
tional machinery and equipment, 
lands, property, rights and ease- 7
ments, plans and speciﬁcations, ‘
surveys, estimates of costs and 3
revenues, prefeasibility studies, 
engineering and legal services 
and all other expenses necessary ;
or incident to the acquisition, 
construction, improvement, ex- 
pansion, extension, repair or 
rehabilitation of all or part of 
drinking water system, storm- i
water, nonpoint source projects,
nutrient credits and wastewater
treatment system projects?”

The phrase “incurring of in-
debtedness” is misleading and *
no doubt carried a negative tone 
to many voters. According to j
the Post-Gazette, Pennsylva- ,
nia’s should not worry about the
state’s ability to borrow money I
because “Wall Street credit rating i
agencies rank Pennsylvania as a 
low-debt state.” Furthermore, 
that amount of detail in one long A
sentence could confuse voters.
Ofﬁcials should reevaluate the
wording of referendum ques- :
tions. Only then will citizens be
able to make a better-informed ,
decision. 

Nevertheless, Pennsylvanians ,
made the right choice on Tues- {
day. Pittsburgh, especially, as a ‘
city of rivers, will strongly benefit ,
from the changes.‘ Soon enough, A
residents will be on their way to }
safer, cleaner water. ;

Latin, once vox populi, is dead

 
   

by Brandon Pfeffer
Colummbt

Where is Max Fischer when
you need him? They say Latin is
dead, but now it is losing what
little ground it has left.

Associated Press reports have
been coming out of Britain de-
scribing the recent movement
to have all Latin phrases edited
out of official government docu-
ments. The local councils in
Bournemouth and Salisbury City
have adopted a “plain language”
policy, which considers Latin ter-
minology too confusing for the
public’s understanding. Com-
monly used Latin terms have been
banned to make way for more us-
er—friendly synonyms: Bona fide is
now “genuine,” and _“improvised”
has replaced ad hoc.

I know that not everyone is fa-
miliar with it, but -Latin is so much
a part of our everyday English that
most of us throw itaround fre-
quently without even realizing. Its
tradition and history is remarkable
in itself, regarded as the language

of the learned in European soci-
eties. For centuries, to speak Latin
was to carry a status symbol with
you wherever you traveled. Scien-
tists, scholars and religious leaders
decrypted its meanings, and only
those who had enough time and
resources on their hands could ac-
cess its mysteries.

On the flip side, lots of people
probably looked at Latin with dis-

 

Latin is so much" a part

dain for that very reason. Anyone
who came from a peasant class
would likely never understand its
speaker, either linguistically or so-
cially. It is particularly difficult to
understand, and, most obviously,
no one really speaks it on a regu-
lar conversational basis. There are
some fair knocks against Latin out
there, but the case against it today
— that Latin is simply not com-

 

mon enough to justify any form
of its widespread usage — is pop-
pycock.

Today Latin is the ofﬁcial lan-
guage of the Vatican City. You
can still attend” Catholic masses

/in Brooklyn that are performed

entirely with the priest reading
passages in Latin and the church
chanting its hymns likewise. The
U.S. Marine Corp lives by the
Latin slogan, “Semper Fidelis” or
“always faithful.” Pitt’s seal cham-
pions the motto “Veritas et Vir-
tus,” “truth and virtue.” And if
you ever try to read any kind of
legal jargon or even the opinions

. of our Supreme Court, you’ll be

much better served by having a
decent grasp of Latin’s basics, as it

is embedded into the very founda- A

tion of our English language.
Without a doubt, one of the
most impressive minds I’ve ever

encountered belongs to my'high .

school Latin teacher. In most situ-
ations, she would probably come
across as unremarkable. She looks
very much like your average high
school teacher, stands a few inches

under the median female height

and. tells stories of her days work-

Obama Win a sign of American unity, progress

 
    

by Shane Levy

Colum/ziat

Shortly after 11 p.m. on Tues-
day night, after Sen. Barack Obama
secured his place as the 44th presi-
dent of the United States, I made
a call to my parents. Both grew up
during the 1960s and 19705, when
some of the most violent and
hateful discriminatory acts against
black people were virtually insti-
tutionalized. That same era in U.S.
history, however, saw some of the
most incredible, progressive and,
at one point, unthinkable move-
ments.

Yet both my parents prefaced
our discussion by saying that never
in their lifetimes did they ever think
that they would see a black man
elected president. Perhaps growing
up in a completely different time
period prevented me from truly
understanding the depth of their
statements, but as I watched elec-
tion coverage and saw black men

and women erupt in tears of joy,
I could not help but feel a sort
of cathartic chill go through my
body. I

Some pundits will point to the
failed Bush administration and to
the fact that 2008 was predisposed
to be a “Democrat’s year,” but
that largely overlooks the historic
achievement of Obama’s election
to the nation’s highest office.

As much as the 2008 presiden-
tial election was centered on the
policies that each candidate would
implement, at the core of Obama
is his incredibly inspiring political
character.

Rarely throughout history have
we seen a leader so capable of
stimulating and motivating Ameri-
cans of all age, race and economic
status to come together in support
of a collective goal.

Names like Abraham Lincoln,
Franklin D. Roosevelt and John
F. Kennedy almost immediately
come to mind when one thinks of
the great orators who have been

president. In 2008, Obama, much
like his predecessors, demonstrat-
ed the capability to stir crowds and
incite hope in all Americans.

Over the course of the Lin-
coln, Roosevelt and Kennedy
presidencies, some of their great-
est accomplishments were started
behind their powerful and unifying
voice. Today, in a time when the
United States desperately needs
that beacon of hope and voice
of unity to provoke changeand
reform, Obama has provided that
in a most stirring fashion. For the
first time in my brief political life, I
have a leader in place who I firmly
believe speaks to my principles and
who I believe stands for and repre-
sents what is right in this nation.

The election of Obama as the
44th U.S. president is, and this is
a vast understatement, one of the
greatest accomplishments in U.S.

history. It not only illuminates how -

far we have come from a time,
not so long ago, when blacks and
whites could not even drink at the

same water fountain, but also ex-
hibits that when the United States
is decidedly focused on accom-
plishing a goal, there is no force on
earth that can prevent this nation
from doing so.

Just like Lincoln ended the
most horrendous institution in
U.S. history, just like Kennedy sent
us to the moon, just like Lyndon
B. Johnson ended years of insti-
tutionalized segregation, Obama’s
election as the next president of
the United States is another dem-
onstration of the beauty of Amer-
ican democracy and shows when
America is uniﬁed behind a com-
mon goal, unimaginable tasks can
become reality.

It is far too early to declare

, what sort of president Obama will -

be, and he surely faces monumen-
tal challenges. But more than any
candidate in recent history, Obama
has the potential to be an incred-
ibly historic and groundbreaking
leader. He has the potential and the
capability to transform the United

States from a nation stuck in the
partisan and futile politics of old
into a nation that effectively meets
and honors the principles that this
nation was built upon in the 21 st
century.

The 2008 presidendal election
will show the world that it was the
time the United States refused to
let outmoded and partisan poli-
tics continue to run this country.
It will show the world that it was
the time when Americans decided
that racial barriers could no lon-
ger continue to stymie this coun-
try’s progress, and it will show the
world that the United States is still
and will continue to be the symbol
of hope and liberty that it has been
throughout its history. Time will
tell what comes of the Obama ad-
ministration, but history will show
that on Nov. 4, 2008, America’s
voice rang loud and clear: Yes We
Can and Yes We Did.

But after spending two furious
years under her tutelage trying to
grasp the Latin language, I will
forever deem her my intellectual
superior.

Anyone who has tried to make
sense of Latin after only being
exposed to English all their life
will understand my simultane-
ous frustration with the language
and respect for those who have
mastered it. It starts our simple
enough: “Puer” means boy, and

to use Latin phrases, sound intelligent

“aqua” means water. But without
much in the way of warning, you’ll
soon progress to declensions. In

order to properly set up a sentence ‘

in Latin, you have to take gender
and letter endings into account
and then determine which of the
ﬁve declensions you want to use.
On top of that, nouns come ir1 six
different ﬂavors, with the function
of the ablative case eluding me to
this day. It is difficult to imagine
what new difficulties arise after
this, which is why I cut my Latin

career short after just two years.
And although I am nothing
close to an expert, my time in high
school Latin has actually helped
me out in a few real world situa-
tions. Just last week, I happened to
engage in two separate discussions
about the Spikejonze movie ‘5Ad-
aptation.” Did I understand the

‘ dual-nature of the main character,

its subtle criticisms of the Acad-
emy or much less the basic plot
structure? Oh goodness, no. But I
kept my mouth shut, and when I

saw my opening, I struck from left
ﬁeld by remarking that the end-
ing was disappointing because it
utilized the alligator as a “deus ex
machina” to artificially resolve the
danger. Just like that, everyone was
quiet, allowing me to slip in that
I was promoted to Grade 2 Gun-
nery Sergeant in "Halo 3."

So be it if the Brits want to cut
their ties with the most prestigious
language the modern world has
known, I won’t let it happen here.
I will continue my overuse of the

phrases “quid pro quo” and “ges-
ta non verba” with little regard
for their conversational relevancy.
Any language that helps me sound
well-read and thoughtful by toss-
ing around a handful of its most
popular phrases deserves my de-
fense.

paret bellum.

PSO backs Broadway star this weekend

Michael Cavanaugh sings covers of Billy Joel, Elton John and Little Richard onstage. On his four-day

Few cover artists have garnered
the attention of the artists who
have inﬂuenced them like Michael
Cavanaugh.

When Billy Joel came to see

i him perform, Cavanaugh got the

surprise of“ a lifetime. “He was
planning on staying about 15
minutes,” said Cavanaugh. “After
watching me for about an hour, he
joined me onstage for a couple of
songs.

“That was a pretty good day
for me,” said Cavanaugh.

From that meeting, Joel saw

potential in Cavanaugh’s skills as
pianist and singer and chose him
to star in the Broadway musical
“Movin’ Out,” showcasing an ar-
ray of ]oel’s songs.

After headlining “Movin’ Out”
for its entire run — from early
2002 until late 2005 — the Broad-
way star is now touring for sym-
phony performances.

Cavanaugh’s next stop is at
Pittsburgh’s Heinz Hall, accompa-
nied by the Pittsburgh Symphony
Orchestra, for a four—day run.

“Audiences should expect to
be entertained,” said Cavanaugh.
“They will see a high—energy show
that is very interactive with the
crowd, and it will be songs they’ll
know and love.”

These famous songs include
“Crocodile Rock” by Elton
John, “Lucille” by Little Richard,
“Whole Lotta Shakin’ Goin’ On”
and “Great Balls of Fire” by Jerry

Conservative punk

comes to Pittsburgh

Michale Graves

The Smiling Moose

Michale Graves is no ordinary
punk rocker.

Despite being the lead singer
for immensely popular horror-
punk band The Misfits in its ’90s
incarnation and a successful solo
artist, many things about him
make him a unique figure in the
punk scene, including his 2005
enlistment in the Marines and his
association with the “conserva-
tive punk” movement.

He became perceived as a sub-

versive force within an already-
subversive subculture, although
it had little bearing on the criti-
cal acclaim generated by his run
with The Misﬁts and in his solo
career.

His newest solo album, I//usiorzs
Ijve / T/z'rei2‘a Park, is a combina-
tion of original songs off of his
last solo album Illusions, acoustic
versions of popular songs he
sung with The Misﬁts (includ-
ing “Fiend Club”, “Shining” and
“Crying on Saturday‘ Night”) and
a number of demos recorded in
conjunction with (and inspired
by) his involvement in the film-
ing of “Perkins 14” in Romania
for HorrorFest’s “8 Films to Die
For.”

Handmade Arcade
keeps things crafty

by Natalie Bell
Staff Writer

Craft enthusiasts will have an op-
purtunity to stock up on handmade
indie goods in Shadyside all week-
end.

Handmade Arcade is an indie
craft fair that will be a two—day event
in Shadyside this weekend, where
 crafters will show off and sell
their unique crafts.

W/hether it’s a lamp made of
cocktail umbrellas, a journal made
of records or a clock made of bike
chains, the Handmade Arcade is
probably the best place to ﬁnd it;

Since it started in 2003, Hand-
made Arcade has been quickly
growing, nearly tripling in size over
the past ﬁve years.

“We wanted to create a market-
place that wasn’t served by the tradi-
tional arts fairs. We wanted to have
a place where you could ﬁnd 
made from reconstructed items,
vintage items, house wares, anything

from $1 to $100,” said Jennifer Bar-
on, a crafter and organizer.

“We found that what a lot of
us were doing was that we were
making crafts in our homes or
home studios, then we were travel-
ing around We really want to put
Pittsburgh on the indie craft scene
map, which we have done over
the past ﬁve years,” said Baron.

Pieces in the past have 
from couch foam dogs to snow
globes made from found objects
and a vatiety of other repurposed
matenals.

The fair will be moved from
its previous location at Construc-
tion Junction to the Historic Hunt
Armory in Shadyside to encourage
the use of public transportation.
They’ll also provide bicycle parking
for crafters and shoppers commut-
ing on two wheels.

Excited craft enthusiasts_can pur-
chase an early bird pass that will al-
low them to shop before the crowds
arrive.

Led Zeppelin Without Robert
Plant is no Led Zeppelin at all

by Justin Jacobs
A c9’E E9[tor

 

Think about your favorite band. It’s
pretty great, right?

Now imagine, if you will, that your fa- .

vorite band decided to hire a new singer.
That new singer, it so happens, used to
front a really awful band like, say, Creed.
Or Insane Clown Posse.

Or, hell, let’s say that the new singer is
one of the guys from 98 Degrees who isn’t
Nick Lachey. No, I don’t know any of their
names, either.

The new singer doesn’t understand your
favorite band, does he? Of -course not
—— he was still eating baby food from an

M airplane—shaped spoon when your favorite

band was touring the country ‘and drinking

' gallons of whiskey every night.

Sounds pretty horrifying right? \Well,
folks, it’s happening. T0, of all bands, Led
Zeppelin. John Bonham must be rolling in
his grave.

nentially a year ago when the band played
a one—off, sold out gig in London honor-
ing record executive Ahmet Ertegun. Of

’ course, original drummer Bonham died in

1980, but replacing_him was his son Jason.
Not. a true reunion, sure, but it couldn’t
have come much closer.

At the end of 2007 and into 2008, there
was huge chatter about a full~scale reunion
tour, but much of it was stifled because of
singer Robert Plant’s project and resulting
tour with folkster Allison Krauss.

Now, it appears, Bonham, John Paul
Jones and Jimmy Page are tired of waiting.

The three announced last week that they

were looking into a full tour with Myles 1

Kennedy, singer of‘ grunge—rock losers Al-
ter Bridge. C-

“Wi/ho?” you ask. \Well, even more dis-
turbingly, Alter Bridge is actually a band
composed of the members of Creed with
Kennedy replacing the insufferable Scott

Stapp on Vocals.

Unsurprisingly, then, Alter Bridge
sounds like the bastard child of Puddle of
Mudd and a dying cat.

Put simply, this is an awful idea. Awful.
Utterly and completely awful.

This is like U2 touring without Bono
(because he was busy feeding starving Afri-
can children) and replacing him with Chris
' Daughtry. Except Led Zeppelin is better
. than U2, and Myles Kennedy is worse than
Daughtry. . ‘

All hatred foranything Creed—related '

"aside, this is a damaging move, because Led
Zeppelin is too iconic for a lineup change
this drastic to ever succeed. -

' Led Zeppelin will forever be made of
Page, Plant, Jones and a Bonham. Each
member is just as much a part of Led Zep-

are integral to The Rolling Stones. -

of his strong following among

punk fans. “[I//miom] began with '

me and Damien Echols talking
and coming up with the idea to
collaborate,” said Graves. “We
began creating lyrics, and I start-
ed writing some songs. Unfortu-
nately, we ran out of money, so
we reached‘ out to the community
for donations and got a lot of
support from the fans, and the
album came out as planned.”

Regarding his time with The
Misﬁts, Graves looks back on it
fondly but laments the tens_ion
and negativity that developed be-
tween the band members, as Jerry
Only, the original bassist for .the
band, reformed the band with

Robert Plant replaced by 

Zeppelin, page l0

When a band has reached the
legendary status of Zeppelin or
the Stones, which few acts have,
the aura surrounding the band
and its music is insulated, as in,
a change to the band itself would
create something that is not the
band itself.

This isn’t like Rage Against the
Machine hiring Chris Cornell to
become Audioslave or even Guns

« N' Roses hiring Scott Weﬂand to

become Velvet Revolver —- nei-
ther of those original bands has
nearly the legend following them
that Led Zeppelin does.

The reasons as to why the

Plant-less trio would -even think I

to tour-are equally baffling. Is it
money? I think not — Zeppelin
has sold more than 300 million
records worldwide, and royalty
checks from the band’s still well-
selling albums have got to be sub-
stantial.

Unless they all blew their
money on yachtsand solid gold

guitars, all the members of Led
Zep should be rich enough to use
hundred dollar bills as toilet pa-
per. Is it some desperate thirst to
createinew music? No, the band
has only expressed interest in
touring, not recording. '
Maybe it’s to spite Plant —
after all, he is the one who shot
down all the reunion buzz in or-

. der_to tour on his own side proj-

ect, likely leaving the band a bit

falselyexcited after the London .

show.

Or maybe Led Zeppelin’s "old
dudes really ‘do want to tarnish
their reputation by hiring a kid téi
do a man’s job.

Whatever thelreason, it’d be a
shame to see Led Zeppelin tour
without actually being Led -Zep-
pelin, no matter if Kennedy’s
voice would do the music justice
or not.

If the guy from Alter Bridge is
singing me “Stairway to Heaven,”
I think I’ll stay here on Earth.

Pitt falls

tourney l

by Jay Huerbin
Staﬂ Writer

Despite making the Big East
tournament for the ﬁrst time since
2006, the Pitt men’s soccer team
fell to DePaul, 3-1, yesterday after-
noon.

The loss officially marks the end
of the season for the young team,
which hopes to build upon one
more year of expeiience.

“It was progress,” said Coach.
Joe Luxbacher about the team this
season. “It wasn’t as much as we
had expected or hoped, but we deﬁ-
nitely irnproved from last year.”

Pitt, which entered the tourna-
ment as the No. 6 seed from the
Blue Division, failed to upset the
Red Division’s No. 3—seeded Blue
Demons in a windy game at Wish
Field in Chicago.

“It was a very windy game,” said
Luxbacher. “But that’s just part of
the game that we had to deal wi .”

Playing into the wind ‘during
the first half, the team got off to a
slow start as DePaul’s Nathan Feltz
ﬂipped the ball past Pitt’s starting
goaltender Eric Barnes in the third
minute. \X/ith now an uphill and up-
wind battle, the Panthers struggled
to stop the rush or start

“Any time you’re on the road,
you want to be very safe and sure
early in the game,” said Luxbacher.
“And when you play a team like De-



Paul, who has only given up nine or
10 goals a season, going down 1-0
early is the last  you want” H

The Blue Demons continued
to control the ﬁrst half, and Mark
Plotkin scored in the 31st minute
to extend the Blue Demons’ lead.
Fletz followed by scoring his sec-
ond goal six minutes later.

Pitt,  been outshot 13-1,
headed into the halftime down,
3-0.

“In the first half, we were just
a step of,” said Luxbacher about
Pitt’s effort “We just weren’t at the
level of play that we needed to be‘)?

Luxbacher came out of the
second half with a new look at the
goaltending position, as he replaced
Barnes with Jordan Marks.

Witli their season on the line,
the Panthers came into the second
half aggressive and desperate for a
goal.

out of business The majority of sports fans have
some level of bandwagon in them, because no-

bodywants tocheer forateam that sucks
——Speakingof which, the Browns aregoingwith

‘Brady Quinn as their new quarterback, singlehand—

edly saving  from bankruptcy.

— Also, Romeo Crennel says it was his decision to V

start Quinn over Derek Anderson, not the Cleve-
land fans’. That’s because the only good decision a
Cleveland fan can make isto move Not that I’m
calling starting Quinn a good decision I’m not.
Just, you know, enjoy the humor.

guys, who had physically been beat in the ﬁr:
half, to play a much more direct style of play,”
said Luxbacher. “We had to become more
physical.” '

It paid off. Less than six minutes into the
new period, Chris Wilcox got Pitt on the».
scoreboard, cutting the lead to 3-1.

Three minutes later, Wilcox looked to
strike again, but his shot rocketed off the post
behind DePaul’s Brian Visser. 1

“After [Pitt’s goal], Chris hit the post and
almost made it a 3-2 game,” said Luxbacher.
“If that ball goes in, it’s a whole new game.
There were still 30 minutes left in the half and
we could have gotten right back into it”

The Panthers, who eventually outshot the
Blue Demons 6-5 hi the second halﬁ showed
signs of desperation, but could not overcomes
their early deﬁcit

With the loss, the Panthers concluded their
season with a 7-8-3 overall record. They fell to
3-6-2 in Big East play.

Still, for the Panthers, optimism for next
yea.t’s team is high.

“We have to get better. They have to get
better. We have to get better players and we
have to coach better. The whole thing,” said
Luxbacher. ‘”I'hat’s the. goal and I think we’ll
have a better team next year”.
