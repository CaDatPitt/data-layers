Advisory Committee fumbles over recommendations

Michael Ringling
Assistant News Editor

In a dimly lit auditorium Downtown,
Chancellor Mark Nordenberg and
a slew of other high-proﬁle college
. presidents and business CEOs met to

T discuss the role of the state govem— —

ment in funding higher education.
The Governor’s Advisory Com-
mission on Postsecondary Education

met onjune 14 at 11 Stanwix St. Down-
town for atwo and ahalihour discus— A

sion on the role of tl1e state govem—
ment infunding higher education and
the ways that government, business
and institutions of higher education

can more efficiently collaborate to .

create “greater accessibility, afford-
ability and employabilityf’

Gov. Tom Corbett appointed the
new Advisory Commission on Post-
secondary EducationinFebruary and
tasked the 31 members with devel-
oping recommendations for higher
education in Pennsylvania. The com-
mission is composed of officials in
public education, private education
and corporations. g

Corbett did not attend the meet-
ing.

Rob Wonderling, the chairman

of the committee, said this discus— .

sion was the third in a process that
will deliver some type of report to
Corbett’s ofﬁce by Nov. 15, but exactly

—

what that report will look like is still
an enigma. A 7
“We don’t know. Not at this stage,”
Wonderling said in response to a pro-
fessor’s question aboutwhat the com-
mittee plans to deliver to governor.
“We are putting a heightened level of

‘ listening to all perspectives.”

The first half of the meeting was
largely ‘composed of speakers from
various institutions takingturns de-
livering ideas and rhetorical ques-
tions to the group about what they
thought needed to be done by their
respective institutions and the Com-
monwealth of Pennsylvania.

Nordenberg was one of the four
commission w0rking—group leaders

that convened at a previous session,
and he delivered a testimony that
was a result of a single session. He
focused his testimony on the impact

a that higher education — particu-

larly Pitt —— has on the Pennsylvania
commonwealth and the role of the
state government in supporting that
system.

“Pennsylvania can neither remain
competitive in the innovation econ-
omy of the 21st century nor meet its
obligations to the next generation of
citizens and workers unless this trend
is reversed,” N ordenberg said, refer-

Five thousand furries bringavatars and art to Pittsburgh

Josh Won
Staff Wrz'ter

Samuel Conway pointed his ﬁnger outside
the hotel window. Two stories below the
middle-aged man dressed in a scientist’s lab
coat, people bustled about the downtown
Pittsburgh streets.

“Stare outside that window,” Conway
said, “and just about anyone you see can
be a furry.”

Conway was referring to the thousands
of people gathered for Anthrocon, the
world’s largest convention dedicated to
the fandom of anthropomorphic animals.
Conway serves as chairman for Anthrocon
Inc., the organization that has hosted the
convention since 2006.

The annual convention, hosted at the
Westin Hotel Downtown fromjune 14 to 17,
attracted about 5,000 people from around
the world to display their zeal for human-
oid beasts by donning fluffy tails, bright
earpieces and all manner of animal suits
emulating everything from cats and dogs
to dolphins and wolves. '

The cost to attend the event was $30
for one day or $60 for all three days of

 
 

Samuel Conway

the convention, which this year featured a
“Midsummer Night’s Dream” theme. Con-
way was conﬁdent that Anthrocon, a 501(c)
(7) nonproﬁt organization, generated an
enormous amount of revenue, estimating
that 2010’s event generated $5 million,

He added that the convention has raised
more than $120 thousand for charities

’ since 1997. This year, the charity proceeds

go to Hello Bully, a rehabilitative group
dedicated to supporting Pit Bulls.

Conway said Pittsburgh is a welcoming
place for furries —— the common name for
those who don the animal costumes.

“We’ve been coming to Pittsburgh for
seven years,” he said. “We love this insti-
tution.”

Conway isn’t the only one: Anthrocon
in Pittsburgh has become an international
phenomenon. ,

“This year we have people from 28
different countries — Japan, Singapore,
Australia, Brazil, Argentina. Be here 10
minutes, and you’re likely to hears/even
different languages,” Conway said. “Ev-
erything from cartoonists and mascots to
performers and artists. Everyone here is a
creative genius.” *

These creative humanoid animal lovers

that converge at Anthrocon emerge from ,

all walks of life.

“Take this ﬂuﬂ’y friend,” Conway said,
pointing out an enthusiastic fan rolling
around and-barking in a wolf suit. “By

The scene at the hotel featured
hordes of costumed enthusiasts.
Scores of sales tables and booths A
lined the hall with vendors sell-
ing handmade costumes, leashes,
harnesses, suits, paintings, comic
books and countless other man-
ners of memorabilia bounded by a ‘
common thread: animals that take
on humanlike features; A.

Bill Holbrook, a nationally syn- ‘
dicated cartoonist selling books
at his stand, described the furry
frenzy as an age-old fascination.

“I don’t have any costumes or
masks, but I have a passion for
drawing animals with human char-
acteristics —— a human fascination that
stems back to Aesop,” Holbrook said.

His furry webcomic “Kevin and Kell”
deals with a complicated romantic relation-
ship between a rabbit and a wolf.

“You can say a lotabout humanity if you
disguise it as animals,” said Holbrook. “In

the case of ‘Kevin and Kell,’ ' ’s about people ‘
overcoming differences. Since they’re a rab— C

bit and a wolf, it. lets the difference stand
for itself.” »

A part-time webcomic artist and family

“Fred Flintstone doesn’t look like

education funding cuts and proposals before
calling for more “robust investments” in the
higher education system.

I In Corbett’s proposed budget for the 2012-
2013 ﬁscal year, three out of the four Pennsyl-
vania state—related universities — Pitt, Penn
State and Temple — stand to lose 30 percent
of state funding from the previous year’s bud-
get. Lincoln University, the fourth state-related
school, doesn’t face aﬁmding cut.

Last year, Corbett proposed a 50 percent a

decrease in funding toward the state-related
universities but settled for 19 percentwhen the
budget was ﬁnally passed. Pitt’s tuition went up
8.5 percent for in—state students and 4 percent
for out-of—state students that year.

Aﬁerthe meeting, Nordenberg said the
gathering was a “good open discussion” that
was primarily an “exchange of ideas.” He added
that he had “nothing concrete” that he would
take from the meeting and implement at the
University at this point. ,
=5-5‘A'i~-~‘Other important players in the region fol-
lowed Nordenberg to -give their views on the
needs of higher education  the_ business

community.

Constance Nichols, a member of the collabo-
ration working group, spoke about the need for
cooperation and collaboration between mem-
bers ofthe higher education, business and gov-
ernment communities. '

Chris Allison, the former CEO of Tollgrade

Communications Inc. stressed that colleges and

universities need to reduce the level of grade
inﬂation and that some students are more suited
for the trades and skills professions. .

“I thinkwe’ve devalued the skills profession
in this country,” Allison said. “I think thatthere
are a lot of students who are in college who
probably shouldn’t be there because they’re
not motivated to be there.” '

He added that he believed in following a
more German model, where students are tested
early on in their academic careers to detemiine
ifthey should follow atechnical track oracollege
track. Furthermore, he emphasized the high
unemployment rate and the need for people
with technical skills.

Jared Cohon, the president of Carnegie.Mel—
lon, stressed the importance of the 200 to 300
research universities in the world. He noted that
there is a distinction between private and public
research universities. . .

wealth of PA appreciates what an incredible
asset — national asset, global asset —- we have
here in the University of Pittsburgh,” Cohon
said. “Without Pitt, without CMU, Pittsburgh
would notbe what it is today,” he said, citing the
creation of hundreds of companies and thou-
sands of jobs as a result of the two universities.

Furthermore, he hoped for a shift in the
discussion on funding for higher education in
Pennsylvania.

“Our mindset is, ‘How much less money can
Pitt get by on?’ That is totally the wrong ques-

 

tion,” Cohon said. “If you accept my point about
what an asset they are — what they represent
for us — the questions should be, ‘How do we
make this even better?”’ A

After the meeting, Wonderling restated
that the commission is in the early stages of
development and that he did not yet know what
recommendations it would give to the governor.
He reiterated that the commission is still in the
listening stage and plans to eventually reach a

. point of organizing the data into “something

actionable.” E

FURRIES

suits resembling wolves, dogs and bulls.

These costumes can range from $1000
to $3000 dollars, according to Anthrocon
Publications Director Karljorgensen.

“I’ve seen ones with robotic ears and
small electronic screens to see out of,” he
said.

Forjorgensen, who has donned the furry
suit a few times, costuming is a labor of
love. '

‘‘They’re really uncomfortable to wear,”
he said. “We have a ‘Headless Zone’ for
costumers to go inside and take a break.

It has fans and water to cool off.”

Following a desire to stay in character,
most furries refused to remove the cumber-
some headgear outside of this zone. Some
even used long straws reaching out of their
costume headpiece to slurp a cold drink to
cool off instead of breaking the fantasy by
removing the suit.

Costumers playfully bent their heads
to get petted and pose for pictures with
strangers but, per an unspoken rule, did
not talk.

Toward the back of the‘ convention hall,

an art gallery exhibited amateur and pro- '

fessional works by furries, and.walls were
covered with works depicting blends of man

and beast. -One painting showed a wolf in a
police uniform. Another showed a cat with
the body of a voluptuous woman.
Coveted works were available to be bid
on during a silent auction, with more en-
vied pieces available in a live auction. All
the proceeds went back to the artists.
“Some years, I’ve seen a piece go for
higher than $10,000,” Jorgensen said.
Toward‘ the back of the gallery was a
mature section, where pieces could only
be seen by those over the age of 18. Such
pieces depicted anthropomorphic animals
in more graphic, sexual displays.
Conway admitted that there were adult
images that might not suit some peoples’

tastes, but insisted that anthropomorphic
animal pornography was not a universal
obsession of Anthrocon attendees. Rather,
he said, many media agencies have cre-
ated a stereotype that stigmatizes furries
everywhere.

“Popular press has done ahack job. I
think it’s a very American reaction to go
‘Oh, _it’s a fetish thing,”’ said Conway, who
has found Europeans much more open-
minded to the furry movement. “Is there
adult material? Yeah, for those who are so
inclined, but we keep the open area safe for
families and children.”

Artist and writer Kitt Mouri had her own
opinions about mature furry art.

“The humanesque body is beautiful; just
like how you would see a beautiful onude
human body in a museum or an art gallery
— it’s just tasteful nudity,” she said.

Aside from her main {fantasy works,
which are all-ages friendly, Mouri also had
a binder of mature art.

She ﬂipped through the binder, which

showed naked humanoid beasts in non-
sexually-charged positions. One depicted

a naked cartoon animal in the shape of all

pregnant woman.

“To each their own, but I personally
don’t care for [pornography] ,” Mouri said.

Jorgensen put the issue of Anthrocon’s
ﬁirry pornography another way: “-It’s really
not what we’re all about.”

The vast majority of what Anthrocon
offered had nothing to do with,pornogra—
phy — much more had to do with creative
identity. ' A ‘P ' A  .

Unlike sci-ﬁ or anirne conventions,
where fans dress like a character they
admire from a show or movie, Jorgensen
explained that most furries, invent their
own characters or alter egos with unique
personalities and appearances.

One furry, identiﬁed as Flying Fire, _
' explained the imaginary creature she in-

vented and identiﬁed with.
“This,” she said holding up a picture, “is

' Breogh, a polymorphic dragon.”

Breogh sported slews of rainbow hues
over a blend of Asian and Western dragonry.

“My friend’s [creature] is a unicorn
dragon crystal Pegasus. And also centaur,”
she added. T

One artist, Bobby, sketched up requests
when he wasn’t busy making his own char-
acters, taking fantasy animals from cus-
tomers’ heads. and drawing them on the
page.

“This is Nivi. He’s an arctic fox,” said
Bobby of the laminated picture pinned
to his shirt. The badge showed a smiling
bluish-gray fox with the build of a slender
teenage boy. He explained that Nivi was

representative of himself in that the crea-'

ture is loud, outgoing and playful.

Bobby said making these characters is
an artist’s way of expressing something.
. For many fans, creating characters is
an opportunity to shape identity. As for a
chance to see one’s fantasy emerge on the
page at the hand of an artist, “It’s deﬁnitely
special,” Bobby said. I

“Don’t  mock the Rust Belt chic: Note
value in history-to—groWth perspective

Nick Stamatakis
Columnist

I recently had the pleasure of
driving to. Pittsburgh somebody
who had never seen: the city.
Raised on the West Coast and
schooled in the East, she had

.visited and even worked in the

great cities of Europe and the
Middle East but, through a poor
twist of fate, had never seen the
Steel City. C '

As we came in from the
Parkway North, with the sky-
line peering out between emer-
ald mounds "on a crisp summer
evening, her initial impression
interested me: Pittsburgh, she
thought, had a palpable sense of
history. _

This was just her initial im-
pression from the highway. Be-
fore getting out of the car, just
by observing the buildings and
layout, she saw in the landscape
a sense of America in the 1910s
and ’20s.

Incidentally, this is the pe-
riod of time when much of mod-
ern Pittsburgh ‘was created.
In Oakland, this was the time

when Pitt constructed its old-
est, still—standing buildings. It
was when the rapidly expanding
population began to fully set-
tle on streets like Atwood and
Bouquet. It was in the decades
around WWI, when the nation
arguably settled into its current
identity, that the city reached
the physical form it still holds
today. '

But is there any signiﬁcance
to this? According to Salon.
com, there might be. An early-
May -article detailing the “Rust
Belt chic” movement suppos-
edly responsible for the revital-
ization of previously declining

‘Midwestern cities points to this

turn of the century mystique as
one of the region’s great assets.
While part of new growth is un-
deniably attributable to cheap
housing for young professionals
and immigrants_ not available
in more expensive parts of the
country, this mythology adds
a creative ﬁre: If 20th-century
America was defined in the
Ohio Valley and Great Lakes Re-
gion, an uncertain 21st—century
America can be deﬁned here

too.
Unsurprisingly, a small con-

_ troversy has developed on the

blogosphere about the article.
Richey Piiparinen, a blogger at
rustwire.com, likes the message,
but doesn’t like its simplicity.
Evenvas a term itself, Rust Belt
Chic implies some kind of goofy,
Brooklyn hipster aesthetic —— a
“loose and lazy” message too
self—referentia1 and self-aware
to have any meaning beyond,
“Come hither; we’ve got coffee
shops in our ruin porn.” (For the
uninitiated, ruinporn is the fas-
cination with industrial decay,
not XXX-rated entertainment
atop old Bessemer converters.)
On one level, it is hard to dis-
agree with Piiparinen. Rust Belt
Chic does exude East Coast con-
ceit: “There go the working men
with their sloop buckets learn-
ing to overcome their dreary ex-
istence.” It isn’t just some silly
narrative driving the region for-
ward, but the happy resurgence
of American manufacturing and
a population still somewhat fa-

ops), these women more subtly
challenge our perceptions of the
liberal-conservative divide.

In some ways these women are
very conservative, even while they
promote a liberal social policy of
government spending for the
poor. While they no longer wear
traditional habits, they neverthe-
less strictly follow the core teach-
ings of the Church. While the
Vatican has criticized them for
their relative hush on issues like
abortion and gay marriage, these
women spend their lives totally
committed to the basic Christian
ideal of helping the poor. Nuns
have become aligned with the po-
litical left in providing support to

, the extremely impoverished, even

while Church leadership has be-
come an ally of the politicalright.

These nuns have found a way
to compromise. They balance the
truly leftist idea of supporting the
poor even while they practice the
conservative lifestyle of a Catholic
nun. The nuns’ example of com-
promise is exceedingly rare in the
context of a society that acts to
divide us. ' ' _

In today’s America, we ﬁnd
ourselves in a constant state of
division. We classify ourselves as
liberal or conservative as if there
is no room in the middle. Even
our beverage choices make us ei-
ther Pepsi or Coke people. There
is the hipster who only drinks
PBR and the jock who exclusively
wears sweatpantsand black socks
halfway up his calf. We are told
that to straddle the fence means

that we are weak and indecisive.

So we end up with people living
on the extremes. You’re either
a part of the Occupy Wall Street
Movement or a spoiled brat who
brainlessly abides by the system.

-You’re either a crazed Christian

ﬁindamentalist or a pagan homo-
sexual. When do we hear about a

* g*Inail.com.’7'I‘

gay student who is also a leader
of the youth group, or a southern
pro-lifer who is a part of student
democrats? We’ve become a soci-
ety comprised of characters from
“The Breakfast Club” and no one
in between. ‘

But life isn’t as black-and-
white as the habit on a nun. Rath-
er, most of us_ are far too dynamic
to comfortably stand on just one
side of the liberal-conservative
abyss that the current polarized
state of American politics has es-
tablished. By being socially con-
servative on issues like abortion
yet quite liberal on government
spending, these nuns illustrate
that it is possible to exist some-
where in the middle ground.

Despite heavy criticism from
the Vatican, these. nuns’ com-
mitment to their particular God
isn’t cheapened by their focus on
achieving social justice through
government spending. By pro-
moting liberal policy even as they
live an extremely conservative
lifestyle, these road-tripping nuns
are a lesson in compromise. It’s
one we could all learn from.

RINGUNG AGAINST THE MAC!-llNE

Maritime metal festivals sink
their landed counterparts

A Michael Ringling
Assistant News Editor

The music festival is a staple for
any genre, but one is taking the
tradition to a new level: sea level.

In the upcoming months,
metalheads and headbangers
alike will have the opportunity
to escape from the traditional
festival campground to a more
tropical and watery setting on
heavy—metal—themed cruises. And
for the most part, these cruises
are ﬁlled with improvements over
the long—gone dry festival setting.

“Barge to Hell,” a cruise that
advertises itself as “the world’s
most extreme metal cruise,” has
a list of bands that play to reflect
the mantra. Sepultra, Sodom, Be-
hemoth and Municipal Waste are
only a few of the 26 confirmed
heavy metal bands on a bill that
expects 40 in total.

The bands are each expected
to play two shows during the
cruise across three separate stag-
es, each of which features its own
atmosphere, from the “Spectrum”
with its club—like feel to the main
stage out on the pool deck.

. The cruise departs on Dec. 3
from Miami and heads to Nas-
sau, Bahamas, before returning
to Florida on Dec. 7.

And if that isn’t enough metal
out on the ocean, The Mayhem
Fest Cruise will depart on its
maiden voyage from Miami on
Dec. 7 and travel to the Bahamas
before returning to the mainland
port on Dec. 10.

The Rockstar Energy Drink
Mayhem Festival is in its ﬁfth
year of touring, but this is the ﬁrst
year the festival will expand into
oceanic territory.

The cruise will include May-
hem Fest veterans Lamb of God,

Hatebreed, Anthrax and others,
each scheduled to play a 90-min-
ute set, as well as some ﬁrst—tim—
ers to the tour, such as Periphery
and Gojira.

Additionally, the cruise is
pushing extracurricular actiVi—
ties, such as an art gallery hosted
by Slipknot’s drummer Clown,
a poker tournament with both
musicians and fans participating
and two nights of DJ sets byJDevil
and Djstarscream — Jonathan
Davis of Korn and Sid of Slipknot,
respectively.

And while the cruises them-
selves stand on their own merits,
they also hold a host of advan-
tages over their grounded festival
counterparts. ‘

First, no one likes being stuck
as the designated driver. While

Avicii ups the ‘Levels’ at
Consol performance

Andrew Gretchko ‘
Senior Staﬁ‘ Wrz'ter

There are three things every concert-
goer needs to be prepared for at an
Avicii show: ﬂashing lights, loud mu-
sic and the Tim Bergling dance — all
ofwhich were present duringlune 14’s
concert at the Consol Energy Center.

For those of you that aren’t famil—
iar with the blond-haired, blue—eyed
Swedish DJ, Tim Bergling —— known
by the stage name Avicii —— is a
22—year—o1d house music genius. Less
than fouryears after first enteringthe
scene, Avicii has earned international
respect after collaborations with
world—renowned Djs such as Tiesto,
Sebastian Ingrosso and David Guetta.

Avicii isn’t known for his stage
presence — he rarely, if ever, ad-
dresses the crowd —— because his
music does all the talking.

Taking the already popular Swed-
ish style of electronic music — an
upbeat sound that appeals to a much
larger audience than niche-genres
like dubstep — Avicii brings a little
something for everyone to each of

_ his shows.

For true electronic dance music
(EDM) fans, there are the big drops.
Avicii’s hit single “Levels” has a “cho—
rus” that comes after a full minute
of buildup. The track has topped
Billboard charts around the world
because of its catchy sound.

The Swedish D] alsomade sure to
tap into his wide repertoire of music,
playing tracks from across his career,
including his newest single “Silhou-
ettes,” which was released on April
27 in the U.K.

For those who attend his con-
certs seeking a_ lightshow, Avicii

_doesn’t disappoint. Standing atop

anall-lwhite human head similar to

V the one in Ridley Scott’s recent ﬁlm

f‘Prometheus,”"Avicii was the cen-
ter of a spectacular display of laser

lighting that ﬂashed in time with the '

music to provide the audience with
an overwhelming experience.
Bright beams illuminated the
crowd from the dozens of lights
ﬁxed far below :Avicii’s throne atop
the giant head, which at times lit up
tobrighten the rave that sprawled out
across the venue. At the end ofhis set,
Avicii wooed the audience when the
topof the large head he was standing
atop propelled forward, putting the

 

Swedish DJ Avicii I
Steven Garﬁnkel | For The Pitt News

D] high above the center ofthe crowd.
Yet for all of his musical prowess,

the man only has one very simple

dance move —— the Tim Bergling.

Step.One: Take your left hand and

place it on your left ear.
‘ No, Avicii isn’t trying to drown out
the roar of the crowds that packtheir
way into concert venues across the
world to see him perform. He’s actu-
ally trying to ensure that the music
the crowd hears is his very best.

Pressing his headphones close
against his ear, Avicii listens to the
music that he often mixes and tweaks
live during a show, proving that he’s
remaining dedicated to his craft while
looking stylish as he stands behind
his DJ set.

Step Two: Take your right hand
and raise it in the air at a slight angle
out in front of you.

This stage of the Tim Bergling
is pivotal, as the crowd repeats it
throughout the course of the show

in order to raise the energy level. Note ,

that your hand should not only be go-
inghigh up in the air, but also forward
at a 45 degree angle. This should be
done in sync with the beat of each
song, and is often accompanied by a
large, face-covering smile. ,'

It may not be a complicated rou-
tine, but the Tim Bergling is sweep-
ing the nation as the Swedish D] has
continued his nonstop round of
tours across the U.S., reaching more
than 20 cities this summer with solo
concerts, as well as numerous music
festivals. ' '

Whether you choose to attend
an Avicii show to learn the Tim Ber-
gling dance or simply to enjoy the
rest of the shows many components,
the experience will leave your heart
pounding and other attendees belting
out his tunes. 3

FILM REVIEW

Sandler delivers typical
performance in subpar comedy

Nata1ie.Be11 ‘
Senior Staﬁ” Writer

l ‘‘That’s My Boy”

Djrected by: Sean Anders
Starring: Adam Sandler,
Samberg
Grade: D

Andy

We get it, Adam Sandler. It’s just not that funny.
Once again, Sandler has taken on the role
of a goofy, misunderstood dilettante who, de-

' spite his garbled speech and outrageous antics, .
I manages to be incredibly likable to everyone.

Except, of course, to the straight man, who

. bumbles around helplessly, trying to get away

from Sandler’s character and simultaneously
earn equal popularity. ‘

It’s unfortunate that Sandler keeps making
movies like “That’s My Boy” — though it isn’t
that bad, the formulaic comedy doesn’t do the
actor any favors. '

While it’s always sweet to see messages of
acceptance, the one in this ﬁlm feels abit like
the same message we got from “Billy Madi-
son,” “Big Daddy” and the many other ﬁlms
Sandler has done. .

Thirteen—year—old Donny (Adam Sandler)

‘had an affair with his teacher Miss McGarricle
that produced a son. When she’s sentenced to .
‘ prison time, he becomes responsible for the

boy, whom he names Han Solo upon turning
18.

As one might suspect based on every other
Adam Sandler movie,‘ Donny is_ an uncouth and
terrible parent who alienates Han. When we
meet him, he’s an alcoholic with an irritating,
jumbled Boston accent who’s tens of thousands
of dollars in debt.

It’s then when he decides to seek out his
estranged son, who has gone on to rechristen
himself Todd and become a successful 4 if
intensely neurotic —— adult, and get him to
go on TV. Per expectation, while it seems he’s
mining his son’s life by entering it, he’s really
saving him from devastating unhappiness.

The movie itself isn’t entirely bad. But such

a mediocre critique is a shame, because Sandler
and Samberg are both excellent humorists.
Their timing is wonderful and their chemistry
is phenomenal — it really seems like they’re
having fun, and that’s one of the most enjoyable
aspects of the movie.

But it seems apparent that they’re capable
of creating something wittier in the midst of
their harebrained shenanigans.

Aside from Samberg’s slow acceptance of
his father and the unwinding of his anxious
demeanor, which is subtle and well done, there

isn’t much of a challenge for the rest of the A

actors. Their roles seem like shallow carica-
tures. Some believability and intelligent humor
would have gone a long way. '

Of course, there’s something to be said for
the immature, frat—boy style humor that inhab-
its the bulk of the movie. There are amusing
moments like when Donny’s “Wazzupl?” gets
all the apparently stuffy adults in on the fun.
But these cheap thrills do not ﬁll the movie,
and it simply needs more.

Truthfully, it’s the comparatively subtle
humor ~— like Donny’s favorite strip club and
omelet diner Bacon and Legs — that’s really -
entertaining. And the overuse of obscene, dis-
gusting and totally unbelievable moments '—
while they may draw laughs — do the movie
a sort of injustice.

Aside from it being unbelievable that any-
one could possibly like Donny or overlook his
obvious addictions, crude behavior and clean-
liness issues, there are far too many bizarre
plot conventions crammed awkwardly into
two hours. Some of the strangest include ap-
pearances by Vanilla Ice, security underwear,
sex with a geriatric woman,.incest and Donny’s
proliﬁc sex life. _

One can only hope that Sandler soon stops
trying to recapture his past glory with adoles-
cent humor and mumbled Words and starts
using his comedic acting chops for more chal-
lenging projects. ‘

Overall, the movie is just another subpar

' comedy. It’s doubtful that it will be anyone’s

favorite movie, though it may one day ﬁnd itself
relegated to the late~night ﬁller spot on cable. I

RINGLING

consecutive rounds ofjéigerbombs, you’re

__ stuck sipping on your quickly warming

Mountain Dew.

On a cruise ship, however, no one is
stuck with the unpleasant duty of driving
sober. Instead, everyone gets to bong beer
on the pool deck while listening to death
growls and guitar solos.

 , Second, meeting new people at a festival

‘ jgis complicated. You need to find a place
[to socialize, and that normally results in

“taking your newfound friend into the areas

surrounding the festival for some quiet
space. It’s doable, but no one really wants
to leave the grounds unless they have to.
But"while on a cruise, every festival~
goer has a cabin with a bed and a shower.
And if everyone has a cabin, everyone has
their own place to return to once the daily
festivities end. _ 2
Third, grounded festivals and rain don’t
mix well. Yes, everyone likes a nice rain
to cool down on a hot festival day, but the
venue quickly degrades into a pit of mud
and urine that becomes a breeding ground
for infection  disease. ,
On a cruisge’ship;.everyone is already

clad in their steel—string bikinis and metal—'
studded crotch covers. And of course, a wet
deck is cleaner than muddy turf.

The only thing_that holds these metal
cruises back from being thepbest thing
since the extinction of hair metal is the
price. _

The Mayhem Festival Cruisewill set you
back anywhere between $699'to $1,499,
and the Barge to Hell costs between $666
to $3,333 depending on the suite. And
these prices don’t include government fees
or the endless streams of alcohol provided

, onboard. 

Carnival Cruises offer similar options,

although void of metal madness, for as
little as $189 per person, depending on the
date of the cruise and the cabin selection.

But if you think about it, these met-
al cruises are a great value. A typical

grounded metal festival can cost a patron _
anywhere from $40 to a couple hundred ,

dollars depending on the venue and the

number of bands playing. And that doesn’t . '

include the burgers and chips, the gas for
the van or the cases of cheap beer and
bottles of bottom—shelf alcohol.

So for the metalheads and headbangers
looking to escape from the same old fes-
tival campground, head to the high seas.

Patterson shines, Adams
debuts at Greentree

Pat McAteer
Staff, Wrz'ter

Although it was only the College
Basketball Invitational, Lamar
Patterson’s performance in the
third-tier postseason tournament
at the end of last season raised
Pitt fans’ hopes for the redshirt
junior. '

And after Patterson’s 24 points

and eight rebounds onjune 18 in‘

his team’s ﬁrst game in the Pitts-
burgh Basketball Club Pro—Am
Summer League at the Greentree
Sports Complex, he appears to be
on the way to living up to those
expectations.

PGT Trucking 78, Steel City
Tickets 63

Thanks to four 3-pointers, Pat-
terson led his team, PGT Truck-
- ing, to a rather‘ easy win over
Steel City Tickets in a matchup
that featured an array of current
and future Panthers. _l ' _

I “I had a couple open shots
early, and they -were going in,”
Patterson said of his ability to
shoot from outside on Monday.
“So I kept shooting them.”

Patterson’s team also featured
incoming freshman and consen-
sus top—ﬁve recruit Steven Ad-
ams, who registered six‘ points,
shooting 2-for-8 from the ﬁeld.

Facing off against Pat For-

’ sythe, a 6-foot—11 redshirt fresh-
man center from West Virginia,
Adams showed his strength in the
post, preventing Forsythe from
establishing position around the

. rim as the future Panther pulled

‘down a game—high 18 rebounds.
’ Adams also put his passing
game on display, dishing out _a
team-high three assists. '
“He’s going to be a great ad-
dition to our team,” Patterson
said" of Adams. “His positioning
is good. He can rebound, shoot
and defend, too.”
Trey Zeigler, a 6-foot-5 junior
guard who transferred to Pitt in
the offseason after starring at

’ _ Central Michigan, also addedﬁve

points and six rebounds for PGT
Trucking.
“Trey is another playmaker

for us,” Patterson said of Zeigler.
“He can shoot the ball and pass
it, and he works hard — he’s a
competitor.” ’.

Pitt players Dante Taylor and
Durand Johnson led the way for

Steel City Tickets, scoring 14 'l

points each.

Taylor, a senior power forward
who struggled at times‘ last sea-
son, showed strength near the
hoop, bringing down seven re-
bounds. Andjohnson, a redshirt
freshman, struggled shooting the

ball but provided three assists for

his teammates.

PGT Trucking will play its next
game on Monday, June 25, at 8
p.m. against SPK Law, while Steel

City Tickets plays onjune 20 at 7 l

p.m. against GNC.
GNC 84, South Hills Audi 32

While it lacked the star power
of the ﬁrst game of the night, the
matchup between South‘ Hills
Audi and GNC didn’t fail to keep
the hundreds of fans at the Green-
tree Sports Complex on their feet.

With one second left in over-.
time, Martins Abele of Duquesne
put back his own miss to give GNC
the victory over South Hills Audi-,
a team that featured alumni from
Pitt and other local universities.

. Prior to overtime, GNC held a
small advantage when Pitt-]ohn-

' stown graduate Kyle Goldcamp

deﬂected a pass to Pitt graduate
Chevon Troutman, who dunked to
give South Hills Audi a 76-75 lead.

But after GNC turned theball
over and intentionally fouled Pitt

graduate John DeGroat, Trout— ‘

man committed a lane violation
that led to a tying free throw by
GN C that sent the entertaining
game to overtime.

DeGroat, a 2006 Pitt gradu-

. ate, ﬁnished with a team—high 21;

points, and Troutman, a 2005 Pitt

' graduate, scored 18 points and

added 11 rebounds. Keith Ben-
jamin, a 2008 Pitt graduate who
wasnft originally listed on South

Barnes: Thunder, Heat don’t 
dery to win championshi

 

 

LeBron James (6) and Kevin Durant (35) are both on the verge of their first NBA title. MCT Campus

Nate Barnes
Staﬁ Writer

With the NBA Finals about halfway

completed, the Oklahoma City Thun— V

der and Miami Heat are only games
away from determining the winner
of the Larry O’Brien NBA Champion
ship Trophy; ‘

Winning the title is a joyous time
for any team and its fanbase, and the
accomplishment is usually celebrated
around the league.

I, however, am not happy at all.

If I had it my way, some sort of
non-lethal event would occur pre-
venting the NBA Finals from reach-
ing completion and keeping both the
Thunder and the Heat from winning

the championship. If I had it my way,

neither of these teams would take
home the trophy.
Here’s why.
I’ll start with the Thunder. .
Undeniably, one of the best bas-

» ketball cities in America is Seattle.

For those of you who don’t know, that
city is where the Thunder previously

. played as the SuperSonics from 1967

to 2008. «
During its timeas the Sonics, the

team featured many of the league’s‘
best players, most notably Walt Haz- ’ V

zard, Lenny Wilkens, Spencer Hay-
wood, Dennis Johnson, Jack Sikma,
Tom Chambers, Shawn Kemp, Gary
Payton and Ray Allen. As a result

of ﬁelding such talented players,-

the Sonics became -one of the NBA’s
marquee franchises, winning six divi-
sion titles, three Western Conference
championships and the NBA Finals
in1979. I

You’cl think41 seasons in one city
as one of the most reputable fran-
chises in the league would earn that
city the right to keep its team.

Think again.

In 2006, the Sonics were sold to
an ownership group headed by Clay
Bennett and Aubrey McClendon after
Seattle’s taxpayers were_unwilling to

7 put up $500 million to build a new
‘ arena for the team. The team’s then-
’ home, the Key Arena, was in great’

shape at the time. Bennett and his
cronies then moved the Sonics to
Oklahoma City, despite previous as-
surances from the ownership group
that its intention was to keep the Son-

.ics in Seattle.

Bennett,‘along with NBA Com-
missioner David Stern, essentially
punished the city of Seattle for not
wanting to pay $500 million for a

-new arena while a suitable one was

still in place by taking away the city’s
ﬁrst and most successful professional
sports franchise.

Later, following the armounce— '
ment that the Sonics would be leav-
ing for Oklahoma City, the franchise
experienced unprecedented success
in the NBA Draft lottery,landing picks
that netted the team formerly known

as the Sonics the players now knovmrn

as the Thunder’s “big three” —— Kevin
Durant, Russell Westbrook andjames
Harden.

The Thunder winning the cham-
pionship would be a victory for Da-
vid Stern and Clay Bennett, and as:

self-respectinghuman being, I do not 0

want to see Stern or Bennett beneﬁt
from their inexcusable decision to
take the Sonics out of Seattle. And
you shouldn’t either.

As for the Miami Heat: This team
winning the championship woul'&'
also represent a victory for the NBA
as a whole, because Miami’s star for-
ward LeBron James’ is currently the
face of the league. ’ V .

The problem I have here is no

self.

Golf needs big names in contentio to ai poplarity

Eric Burrage

— U: Staff Wrz'ter

For the ninth consecutive time, golf crowned
a ﬁrst-time major winner this weekend at one
of the sport’s premier events — the United
States Open. »

Webb Simpson, a relatively unknown
26-year-old from North Carolina, continued
the trend of new faces winning golf’s biggest
prizes as he rallied from a four—stroke deﬁcit
on Sunday to win at the Olympic Club in San
Francisco.

Simpson joined names like Bubba Watson,
Keegan Bradley, Darren Clarke and Rory Mc-
Ilroy on the list of recent ﬁrst-time major win-
ners, while the names that golf fans are used
to seeing at the top of the leaderboard — Ti-
ger Woods and Phil Mickelson —— continue to
struggle in the four armualamajors.

Golf hasn’t seen big—name dominance for

. "lcfuite some time now, and many would agree

that the sport has suffered as a result.

The parity is good for up-and-coming golf-
ers like Simpson, who have thoroughly capital-
ized on the absence of a dominating ﬁgure since
Woods’ struggles following his much publicized
off-the-course issues in 2009.

But for the sport of golf, the opposite seems
to be true.

Like in other sports, parity is a good thing
when it comes to breaking up old patterns of
dominance; for instance, a lot of fans enjoy

seeing the Los Angeles Lakers lose in the NBA
and the New England Patriots suffer defeat in
the NFL.

But when parity becomes the pattern, issues

- arise, especially in a sport like golf, where there

are no storied franchises, coaches or anything
else to talk about.

In golf, it always comes down to the players
themselves and whether or not the stars are in
contention.

If Tiger Woods’ decade-long stranglehold

on golf teaches us one thing, it’s that the sport W

generates its popularity through dominating
performances and multiple. major winners fre-
quently competingfor the titles at the Masters,
the U.S. Open, the British Open ‘and the PGA
Championship.

Golfers like Woods and Mickelson, who have
combined to win 18 majors, attract fans and
supporters to golf in a way that the unknown
winners that the sport has seen recently simply
don’t. .

This is the reason that the media continues
to extensively cover Woods, even during his
recent stretch of relative mediocrity. And it’s
the reason that each time a new face wins a
major, we ask the question, “Is the Tiger Woods
era over?”

When someone-new earns the honor of win-
ning a major tournament, it seems as though we
give more attention to the fact that Tiger didn’t
win than we do to the newcomer. _

What the sport desperately needs is for one

than one major and begin to develop apersona

Remember the buzz Rory Mcllroy was able

atthe U.S. Open last year? His eight—shotvictory

 FINALS

James represents the antithesis of what
basketball should stand for: He is a player who
wants to make as much money as he can and
stuff the stat sheet as much as he can.

The former Cleveland Cavalier is capable
of great athletic feats on the basketball court,
and no one can debate that he is a once-in—a—
generation talent. I will not deny that. Whatl
will deny is the idea that he is awinner, let alone
that he cares about winning in the ﬁrstplace.

From my perspective,James cares about his
brand and wealth more than making himself
one of the best players in NBA history, which he
could certainly do with the talent he has. If he
cared about beingthe best, he would have stayed
in Cleveland and not run to Dwyane Wade in Mi-
ami, where any ﬁtles he may win will be tainted
by his quick desertion of his former home.

' Ifhe truly cared aboutwinning, he would not
have announced his decision to leave Cleveland
in a self-promoting, one-hour television spe-
cial, and he certainly would not have wanted to
participate in the equivalent of a championship

 

game, at which he infamously promised Heat
fans “not one, not two, not three, not four, not
ﬁve, not six, not seven ...” championships. Pre-
sumably, he was not implying they’d win zero.
Think about the players that are associated
with winning in the NBA’s history —— Bill Rus-
sell, Michaeljordan and Magicjohnson. These
players cared aboutwhat happenedon the court,

‘ and nothingelse mattered to them. Theywanted

to win, and that’s what they did.
James arguably is more talented than any
one of these players. And eight years into his

- career, what does he have to show for it‘? Some

regular—season Most Valuable Player awards,
two losses in the Finals and a lot of NBA fans
who hate him.

I don’t know what’s going on inside LeBron’s

head — although that would certainly be nice to ‘

know—- but based on the pattern ofhis career,
James appears to care more aboutwhat happens
off the court than what he does on it.

Regardless of both franchise’s jaded recent
pasts, sometime in the next few days, the NBA
Finals will cometo an end with either Oklahoma‘
City celebrating a championship that should
have been won for Seattle orJames and the Heat
prevailing and lifting the trophy.
