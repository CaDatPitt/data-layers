Students plan to rush Heinz Field

Police, administrators issue warnings leading up to Pitt-Cincinnatigarne

Marissa Meredyth
For The Pitt News

Nearly 2,000 people have signed-

up on Facebook to “Rush the ﬁeld
when (not if) we beat Cincy.”
During last year’s Pitt-Cincin-
nati matchup, Cincinnati fans,
confused by a four-second delay
in the game, rushed the ﬁeld in

celebration before Pitt ﬁnished
its ﬁnal play. Students from East
Carolina University rushed the
ﬁeld when they beat West Virginia
University last year, and just this
past October, ,Georgia Tech fans
rushed the ﬁeld after they beat
Virginia Tech, tearing down a goal
post as they went. ,

“I understand [Pitt] might
be unhappy because its an NFL

ﬁeld, so another team needs to
play there,” Pitt student Braden
Slike, who created the Facebook
event, said. “But other schools
can rush the ﬁeld when their
teams win, and I feel that we can
do the same.” . .

But oﬂicials said they’ll cite
fans who rush Heinz Field tomor-
row and also send Pitt students
who do so to the University’s Ju-

dicial Board. a

“The ticket for an athletic
event permits the fan access to
the public walkways and their
assigned seats. It does not grant
permission to enter the ﬁeld or
locker room area,” Pitt police
Chief Tim Delaney said in an e-

mail. “Violators could be cited for-

jumping onto the ﬁeld.”

Thanks to a new Facebook

The group, like sites such
as “Texts from Last Night” or
“Overhead in New York,” is part
of a growing Internet trend in
which people post out—of~context
and anonymous snippets of other
people’s conversations. '

Pitt sociology professor Dan
Romesberg said, “Social skills,
in general, in this technological
age have deterred quite a bit. It’s
not strange that people tend to
gravitate toward anonymous and
faceless forms of communica-

Searching for the secrets of our universe

Pitt professors and researchers travel to Geneva in hope of finding a key to understanding our own existence .-

Eric Shannon
For The Pitt News

Pitt professorjoe Boudreau might one day
be able to explain how the universe formed
and why matter has mass.

Boudreau has been working on the
Large Hadron Collider, a machine that
broke a world record Monday for acceler-
ating particles faster than any man-made
device has ever done before.

The Collider, a project on which univer-
sities from around the world are partici-
pating, is a particle supercollider located
near Geneva. The collider itself consists

of a large, tubular device through which A

particles accelerate to create high energy
collisions. .

Several detectors at other locations re-
cord the results of the collisions. Boudreau
and Pitt professors Wilfred Cleland, Vladi-
mir Savinov andjames Mueller, as well as
several Pitt graduate and post-doctoral
students, work at a detector called AT-
LAS. They travel there at different times,
but in between, there’s always someone
stationed there.

“I go all the time. I’ve been there for at
least a few days every month since May,“
Boudreau said.

“It’s important to have people on site
...because this is the nervous center of
the experiment, and if you want to keep
in touch with colleagues, you have to be
there,” he said, noting that they sometimes
work via teleconferencing as well.

At ATLAS, Boudreau and his colleagues
focus on creating complex software and
electronic instruments to detect “exotic”
physics that do not adhere to the standard
model of the universe and to study sub-
atomic particles, Boudreau said.

He said scientists hope to find out if
the Higgs boson particle exists. Scientists
have predicted that it does, but it is yet to

be discovered. This particle could be key
in discovering what conditions caused the
Big Bang that many scientists believe led
to the creation of the universe. '

He said this is a critical part of the ex-
periment. The standard model of physics,
he said, depends upon the Higgs‘ boson
particle, which scientists believe gives all
matter its mass.

If the particle doesn’t exist, Bou-
dreau said, “it means we’re on the wrong
track.”

He said that scientists have generally
accepted the standard model of physics
because _it’s the easiest way to explain why
matter has mass. ' '

If doesn’t exist, he said, “then where
does the mass come from? If it’s something
beyond the Higgs boson, then the theory
needs to be modified.” . _

It might be easier for scientists to use
the collider data to ﬁgure out how the

universe was formed. Boudreau said many ,
scientists believe that studying high en— ’

ergy collisions will give them insight into
the earliest movements of the universe.
“If you look at the history of the uni-
verse, you know that it’s expanding and
it’s cooling down. The energies of this

collision bring us back to a point where"

some interesting things were happening,”
hesaid. L
But Boudreau said it might be three
to five years before scientists can begin
experimenting with the collider. Now, he
said, scientists are working below maxi-
mum power. They want to test the col-

lider first to make sure it won’t break, _

he said. ‘

The collider, which has been in the V

works for the past 20 years, has been mak-
ing international headlines lately. Some
people fear it will cause black holes that
will destroy the world or that it could be
used to create the anti-matter needed to
make a bomb, as it was in the novel and

Particle collider with record

The Large Hadron collider (LHC) experiment on the French-Swiss
border has set a new world record, pushing the energy of its particle
beams beyond one trillion electron volts.

How it works

 '

  
   
 

CERN’S Large
Hadron collider
The new Large Hadron
Coliider, based at the
French-Swiss border, uses
powerful magnets to accelerate
protons to nearly the speed
of light; the protons race in
opposite directions within
vacuum-sealed metal pipes‘
aiong a bigring.

- Collisions of protons occur near
intricate detectors that track the
shower of debris from the impact
and measure how much energy the
fragments carry ’ ‘ '

- Results from suchcollisions add
to the knowledge of ordinary matter,
like the Higgs‘ boson, la’ _
still-theoretical particle that may tell
scientists what gives objects their
mass ' ~ -

the University if that conduct seriously
threatens the health, welfare, or safety of
the University community or any individual
member thereof, or that conduct reflects
upon the student’s character and ﬁtness as
a member of the student body.”

Student Conduct Officer Deborah Walk-
er said in an e—mail that “having thousands
of students push toward‘ a railing and
jump over a 10- to 15-foot wall certainly
threatens the health, wellness and safety
of those in attendance. People have been
killed in stampedes at concerts and sport-
ing events. —

“Even if you could come up with a way to
get the students on the ﬁeld in an orderly
fashion, you would not be able to control
what happens on the ﬁeld. There are legiti-
mate safety issues for players and coaches
from both teams, as well as people working
the game in an ofﬁcial capacity if there were
thousands of people on the ﬁeld.”

Walker said the punishment for vio-
lating the Student Code of Conduct could
range from ﬁnes and community service to

suspension or expulsion. Students found
guilty of a violation of the code, she said,
“could see it remain on their permanent
record, and that could affect job prospects
in the future  Student conduct records
are kept on ﬁle for seven years.”

Walker said the University plans to
inform students of this by playing an

an ad in today’s Gameday Extra edition of
The Pitt News, which will also be distrib-
uted to students on Saturday, to promote
responsible celebration.

Walker also posted on the event’s Face-
book page, “University students that are

“I know Pitt students have a history of
being destructive while celebrating. When
I created the event, I tried to make it be
known that it should be a peaceful, non-
destructive celebration,” he said.

Slike said he’d want students to under-
stand the risks of storming the ﬁeld,

“But if they still wanted to participate,
that’s completely on them,” he said.

Students are also subject to Heinz Field’s
Code of Conduct, which makes no speciﬁc
reference to rushing the ﬁeld. It does say
that fans who are disruptive, break the law,
interfere with the progress of the game or
fail to follow instruction of stadium per-
sonnel “will be subject to ejection without
refund and loss of ticket privileges for fu-
ture games.” "

The Big East has no speciﬁc policy on
ﬁeld rushing — although the organization
doesn’t encourage it, Chuck Sullivan, Big
East spokesman, said.

When Cincinnati students rushed the
ﬁeld in Nippert Stadium prematurely last
year, the conference didn’t issue any penal-

Delaney said he’s working with Pitt’s
athletic department, the Division of Stu-
dent Affairs and Heinz Field security to
design a security plan for use before, dur-
ing and after the game.

“We expect an exciting victory, with‘
the students celebrating in a responsible
manor,” he said. “It is imperative that the
fans remain in their seats and avoid enter-.
ing the ﬁeld for several reasons; the post-
game ceremony, fan and player safety, and
potential damage to the playing surface
could have an effect on Sunday’s Steelers
game.”

Delaney declined to say how many extra
officers will patrol Saturday, citing security
reasons. i

“We always prepare for the worst case
situation,” he said. “In this instance, we
are concentrating on two locations, North
Side and Oakland. We are working with
the City of Pittsburgh Fire Department, as
well as their police department, to ensure
the celebration will be safe and without

physical injuries).”

“I personally know Mark Nordenberg

not want to dignify that student’s post with

familiarity of the group make it appealing
to students.

“It’s more local than sites like ‘Texts

people like it because they can relate and
say, ‘Oh, I’ve been there.”’

He said his inspiration to start the '

where his friends showed a similar Face-
book group,-“0verheard at Penn State.”

Whitman created the group last year,

about 200 members at the end of last
semester. _ ‘

But at the beginning of November, the

group’s popularity suddenly exploded. -

It currently boasts almost 4,500 mem-
bers.

Whitman said he has no explanation
for the sudden popularity of the group.
He said it surprised him as much as ev-
eryone else.

“I just got on it one day and I was like,
‘Oh my God,”’ he said.

The group currently has more than
1,000 posts from students describing V
overheard pieces of ditzy or bawdy con-
versations, as well as strange things that

professors have announced to classes.

A similar citywide blog, “Overheard in

been having technical difficulties since
August and is currently not active.

Don’t hate the turtle , hate the game

Ben Korman
Columnist

The celebrated Nintendo video
game series “Super Mario Bros.”
features a set of antagonists that
lookvlike turtles but are labeled
by the developer as Koopas.

They’re amphibious green
little buggers with shells, four
extremities and pointed beaks
—— all the hallmarks of true tur-
tleh'ood.>The playful branding
of these enemies is semantic at
best. As my taxidermist grand-
father used to say, “If it walks
like a turtle, swims» like a turtle
and has a shell that looks like
it would make a terriﬁc gift for
your grandmother, then it’sia
turtle.” _

These games, first and fore-
most, graphically depict in-
nocent, healthy turtles being
slaughtered by the hundreds at
the hands of human characters.

rio, is consistently‘rewardedfor

humans in the game are, in fact,
capable of collecting additional
“lives” — meaning, when they
die, they’re not really dead. In
contrast, when the Koopas die,
they really die.)

To add to the horrid events

J if Current military strategy won’t produce resultsafter 18-month checkup

Shane Levy
Columnist

I wrote a column on Nov. 9 about
how the current path of the war in
Afghanistan is structured similarly
to that of the Vietnam War some 40

:_ years ago. Though the state of the
 5 war in Afghanistan has been widely
 compared to Vietnam, President ’

Barack Obama’s address at West
Point reminded me of stark dif-
ferences. 4

The war in Afghanistan and
Pakistan poses much more tangible
and severe threats than anything

I that could have taken place in Viet-

nam. Terrorists already executed
these threats in nations and cities

0 throughout the world, most nota-

blyvon Sept. 11. _

The continued existence of the
Taliban and al—Qaida poses im-
mediate and real threats to U.S.
security.

In Obama’s address Tuesday
night, he said, “In the last few

months alone, we have apprehend-l

ed extremists within our borders
who were sent here from the border

region of Afghanistan and Pakistan
to commit new acts of terror.”

There is certainly a critical
threat that the current makeup
of U.S. forces and Afghan troops
cannot effectively eliminate in the
Afghanistan-Pakistan region.

Yet Obama’s decision to send
30,000 additional troops to Af-
ghanistan and enact an 18-month
timeline before troops are brought
home does not help suppress any
skepticism regarding the war.

Even with NATO troops ﬁghting
in Afghanistan, this is unquestion-
ably a U.S. war.

Obama spoke on the signiﬁ-
cance that Pakistan plays within
the entire context of victory in Af-
ghanistan. Currently, military lead-
ers and federal officials believe that
the Afghanistan-Pakistan border is
a sanctuary for both the al-Qaida
terrorist network and numerous
cells of the Taliban regime.

That same region, whichspans
virtually the length of the southern
border of Afghanistan, is composed
of some of the most volatile and
violent areas of Afghanistan.

U.S. troops are almost exclu-

sively the ones ﬁghting in areas

such as the Helmand, Kandahar,
Zabol and Paktikia provinces.
Though additional troops might

» help suppress Taliban inﬂuence,

the potential for victory effectively
lies with the military support and
leadership of the Afghan govern-
ment and U.S. partnership with
Pakistan -— something that was

Even with NATO troops
- ﬁghting in Afghanistan,

this is unquestionably a
U.S. war.

not emphasized enough in‘Obama’s
address.

Gen. Stanley McChrystal, com-
mander of U.S. troops in Afghani-
stan, said in his assessment of the

situation in Afghanistan that in

order to achieve some sort of vic-

tory in the region, the U.S. military
and government requires a “bet—
ter understanding of the [Afghan]
people’s choices and needs.”
Though the additional troops
should “effectively train and part-
ner with Afghan Security Forces
and better secure the population,”
as Obama claims, U.S. military ef-
forts will not be the ﬁnal solution
in the region. It will require diplo-
matic and political efforts to con-
struct a legitimate government that
can provide consistent and effective
security throughout the country.
The continued existence of an
Afghan state -— and the creation
of a safer world —- certainly de-
pends on the efforts of President
Hamid Karzai and his government

_ to build trust with the different eth-

nic groups inAfghanistan and work
to create a- stronger, more account-
able government.

The United States’ ultimate
goals, the eradication of al-Qaida
and Taliban cells, will not be met
with the current military strategy.
Though Obama did not address
speciﬁc strategic elements of the
ﬁght, current military strategy

Obama’s Afghanistan speech unconvincing

failed at this critical juncture and
only elongated the situation on the
ground. It is crucial that the troops
Obama will deploy in early 2010
be prepared to ﬁght a new style of
counterinsurgency.
Obama’s brief, yet pragmatiff,

address reinforced the virtually
universal idea that this effort will

not be an easy task. No presidential -

address since Sept. 11 has left me
feeling so uneasy and unsure.

Though Obama asserted that
the U.S. presence in Afghanistan
was not one to “build nations,” in
the United States, we are struggling
just to maintain our own nation.

Facing the most severe econom-
ic crisis since the Great Depression,
a blood—war over health care £3-
form and crumbling infrastructure,
Obama was backed into a corner
on this critical decision. I fear that
in 18 months, when troops begin
withdrawing from Afghanistan and
tangible results are expected, the
American people might not see the
results they hoped for.

RE‘-

A practical guide on how to live cheaply  

Gensheimer and granny take a five-star vacation witha three—star budget

Alie Gensheimer
Columnist

  
 

You wouldn’t know it by looking
at me, but I am the cheapest person
alive. I take after my granny. While
she and I tend to dress fashion-

p ably, dine at ﬁne restaurants and

frequent the symphony, we always
ﬁnd a way to save money, thanks
to that cheap gene somewhere in
our DNA.

Having spent years practicing,
my granny and I bring a new mean-
ing to the word “cheap.” No longer
does it involve missing out on all
the ﬁner things in life. Rather, you
can live lavishly and ﬁnd little ways

to beat the system and conserve
money, simply by learning where
to spend and where to save. ’

_ Take these helpful hints from us
veteran cheapskates, and you will
learn to live like kings and queens.
Well, almost.

When it comes to traveling,

don’t skimp on the entire experi-

ence. Sure, you should ﬂy South-
west and rent a compact car, but

, don’t, by any means, feel the need

to lodge at a Motel 6.

Granny and I took a spring break
trip to Pheonix a couple of years
ago and stayed in one of the most
inexpensive rooms at a lush, ﬁve-
star resort, the Biltmore.‘Despite
the low room bill, the room was
still luxurious, complete with thick
bath towels, bathrobes and marble
ﬂoors. The best part about staying
at the Biltmore, though, was being
able to use the seven pools and dine
at the high-end restaurants.

Of course, when it came to din-
ing at an expensive resort, Granny
and I knew how to save a few bucks.

First, we split an entrée —— a simple '

way to minimize the tab.
However, be sure to search the
menu for a split plate charge, a high
fee to divvy the dish on two sepa-
rate plates. -
If this is the case, don’t inform
your waiter that you’re splitting the
meal. Instead, just dive in with two

forks. Order a side salad and split
a dessert to make sure you don’t
leave hungry. «

At breakfast at the Biltmore,
one order of coffee comes with a
full pot and one mug. Two orders
still come with only one pot of cof-
_fee, albeit two mugs. By the second
day, Granny and I ﬁgured that we
were getting charged double for ’

66

A My granny and I bring a
new meaning to the word
“cheap? '

the same amount of coffee when
we each ordered it for breakfast.
Therefore, only one of us ordered
coffee and we shared the mug.

‘Simple.

Yes, the rest of our family found
this hilarious, but we were quite
proud of ourselves. Why would we
pay for two coffees when we would
get the same amount by ordering
one? Now I assume things don’t
work this way at every high-end
dining institution, but these are
tips to keep in mind. '

When Granny and I see a buffet,
we think “jackpot.” Granny usually
eyes a’ few items on the buffet but
also ﬁnds at least one menu item
potentially palatable. Hence, I or-
der the buffet and can bring her the
select dishes she wants from it, and
she can still order off the menu —
and needless to say, buffetsare all
you can eat.

When we’re not eating while on
vacation, we often go to the movie
theater. But frequenting the movies
can rack up quite thelbill, despite
the senior, student and matinee
discounts. And movie concessions?
We should be getting a meal for
those kinds of prices. For that
reason, and because we’re health

conscious, we bring our own pop-
corn.

Granny’s specialty, which she
has passed on to me, is to pop her
own popcorn on the stove with
the smallest amount of oil anda
pinch of salt. She pours it into a
brown lunch bag and supplements
it with a can of Coke and some Dots
candy.

Not only does this save us thou-
sands of calories and grams of fat
from the salt and butter drenched
on movie theater popcorn, but
also hundreds of dollars over the
years. -

Lastly, if you’re not satisﬁed
with your service, meal, etc. speak

up! As long as you are not satizrr’

ﬁed, there is always a-chance for
receiving a free dessert, a coupon
or anything else with the word
“complimentary” in front of it.
Remember that anunhappy cus-
tomer often becomesfa satisﬁed
cheapskate. ‘ l‘ I

‘Awkward turtle ’ a sign
of society’sdisrespect

Korman 4 12

Are we really to believe that
shelled amphibians were simply
chosen arbitrarily as the series’
most pervasive antagonists? Was
Bowser, the chief nemesis in the
series, portrayed as a belligerent
power-tripping—maniac-turtle—
thing with no speciﬁc message
in mind? Is the shelled commu-
nity simply a capricious victim
here? V

I,‘ g If the portrayals typical in the
media and popular culture are
any indication -4 hardly.

The Teenage Mutant Ninja
Turtles taught our generation that
engaging in hand-to-hand com-
bat in public areas is an accept-

--able thing to do. The Slowsky’s,
a family of turtles depicted in
a series of Comcast Broadband
commercials, portray the species
as arcane, culturally trapped and
lethargic. Filburt Shellbache of

the mid-90s Nickelodeon car-
toon “Rocko’s Modern Life” is
depicted as bothersome, neu-
rotic, perpetually nauseous and

incapable of ﬁnancially support-
ing himself. -

The Mario franchise tiptoed
around this hot-button issue
with 1993’s “Super Mario Bros.”
movie, in which they decided that

“Finding Nemo” should
have been a landmark
moment in terms of fair
portrayal of turtles.

Koopas would be much cooler
if they were scary dinosaurs.
“Turtles are boring,” they prob-
ably thought. “Not gonna put the
fannies in the seats.”

In 2003, Disney took an en-

couraging step forward in ﬁc-
tional turtle-human relations
when a turtle helped a lost young
clownﬁsh reunite with his father
in “Finding Nemo.”

“Finding Nemo” should have .

been "a landmark moment in
terms of fair portrayal of turtles.

Instead, persistent negative me-

dia portrayals continue to spawn
a culture so contemptuous that
socially uncomfortable situations
are noted by a joint “awkward
turtle” remark and accompany-
ing gesture. 

More than‘2,5‘ afo years ago,

~ Aesop told us the story of the tor-

toise and the hare. The tortoise’s
victory was a triumph for millen-
nia, and today, it is one of the few
remainingcultural references we
have of shelled amphibians as
virtuous creatures.

They might not be able to talk
back, but they just might snap.

To the Editor,

When I packed up my closet to move to Pitt, I made sure nota chunky
sweater, knee sock, or winter boot was left behind. I’m not ashamed to
admitl came with ﬁve pairs of gloves. '

But my dreams of cozy collegiate winters spent wrapped up in scarves
and books have quickly melted. As I enter any University building, I must
remove at least two layers of clothing in order to avoid the unsettling
feeling that I am roasting in my coat. As I exit,-my ﬁngers again must
return to my pockets, lest they lose mobility. .

Recently, there had to have been at least a 30-degree disparity be-
tween my room in Towers and the temperature outside. This would be
welcoming if it were, say, less than 45 degrees outside, but currently
it’s just a hindrance. I can make it hotter — in case I feel the need to
study naked — but not colder. I could open a window, but that would
be counterproductive. 4

The uncomfortable‘ difference in temperature not only complicates
my winter wardrobe, but it also hurts the environment. What was that
about our “C” grade on the college stainability report card?

So, administration, why not turn down. those thermostats‘? If we
ﬁnd it too cold, we can throw on a sweater. I, for one, would be glad to
have the option.

To the Editor,

The recent column by Mason Herron speaks lengths. to the common
tendency of a particular subset of Americans to misinterpret the current
debate on the relative decline in U.S. hegemony. More so, it conveys the
fundamentals of modern U.S. power through an inaccurate and antedi-

luvian lens of analysis. Despite his rant citing militaristic absolutes of i

U.S. defense spending and growing number of naval bases — mostly

' in Southeast Asia and the Persian‘ Gulf — the article fails to convey
' both the repercussions of policies rooted in brute force, as well as the

detrimental economic costs.

Where Herron would contest that U.S. power is reﬂected in the size of
its army, many would contend its inﬂuence is precisely the opposite. The
promise of equal opportunity, individual liberty, a world class education,
entrepreneurial success, voice in public affairs and economic opportu-
nity form the basis of U.S. inﬂuence that others admire. It has been the
historical imperative of regimes considerably less liberal and democratic
than the U.S. to compensate for the lack of these opportunities by way

of force. Sending the message that maintaining U.S. superiority in the ‘

military realm is the sole determinant of continuing its “countless allies”
dependency on the nation is both reckless and misleading.

Herron has the bare facts right: The U.S.’s annual defense budget
is impressively larger than any other country’s, it’s naval ﬂeet copious

and its global show of force painfully obvious. However, his View mis— .

understands the nature of the U.S. global competitiveness.
The future of U.S. hegemony will depend not on military strength

-— the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq have shown that excessive military
spending cannot buy even military success — but on the centrality of .

the domestic market in global trade. In particular, this includesprudent
U.S.-Chinese trade relations, whereby despite pressure from domestic
interest groups, protectionism is disliked, as it threatens the ﬂuidity of
the U.S. market based on cheaper foreign goods. _

Moreover, the symbiotic relationship between the U.S. market for
Chinese goods and the Chinese market for U.S. debt must be maintained
through mutual self-interest, negotiation and appropriate ﬁnancial
decision making, rather than whose arsenals are the biggest.

No nation can maintain meaningﬁil global inﬂuence on ﬁnancial
and economic insolvency, nor will its allies continue to support it based
solely on the size of its army. I-encourage readers to look beyond the
superﬁcialities that make the U.S. the great nation it is.

Some bands want to tour the
world. Others want to produce
apersonal musical masterpiece.
HORSE the Band has accom-
plished both.

After completing a 45-country
tour and releasing its new record
Desperate Living, the band has
seen some amazing places, sur-

vived the most unusual circum-
stances and worked with several
talented artists completely unre-
lated to its self-proclaimed genre
of N intendocore, '
Despite several line-up chang-
es over its 10-year ‘career, lead
singer Nathan Winneke believes

the band is having the bestyear

yet.

“Right now, we have my dream
lineup. Everyone’s pretty stable,
easy goingand there’s no animos-
ity. We’re all on the same page.
Right now, I’m really enjoying
what I’m doing,” he said. _

In March, the band decided to
embark on a three-month ‘tour

across Asia, Australia and Europe ‘

We wanted to do something that
would change our lives.

HORSE the Band takes Earth

Musicians ﬁnish 45 —country tour to promote release of their new record

known as the Earth Tour.

Without any offers to tour
from any bands. or booking
agents, HORSE the Band decided
to tour alone, spending $100,000
by maxing out ﬁve credit cards
and hoping for only one thing:
that they wouldn’t die.

“We wanted to do something
that would change our lives,”
Winneke said.-

Fortunately, the band survived
the incredible trek but came close
to disappearing from the map in
the mountains of Western Europe
after its GPS died on the way to
the Ukraine.

Instead, the band ended up
in what is known as “Europe’s

. Black Hole,’j Transnistria, a fro-

zen conflict zone where soldiers
guard the border.

After 12 hours of painful
searching for a way around on
dirt roads and through gypsy en-
campments, the band reached
the Ukraine and missed its sched-
uled show.

Near the end of the tour, Win-
neke broke his shoulder but still

December 4, 2009 | The Pitt News I WWW.pittneWs.coni

Here ’s to starting a media frenzy with movie previews, early vacations and a condom belt

Kieran Layton
A8'E Editor

During the kick-off to the winter

holiday season every year since.

3,302, talk show favorite Oprah
bestows upon the masses her
“Favorite Things” on an episode
of her show, subsequently incit-
-ing widespread consumer riots
of people who want to feel one
degree closer to the media god-
dess. '

This year, however, produc-
ers chose to yank the popular
episode from the lineup, stating
that, “For the past couple years,
it just wasn’t feeling right, so we
éidn’t do ‘Favorite Things’ as part
of our lineup.”  '

Housewives around the coun-
try, I feel your pain. I

So to ﬁll this emptythasm of
media-driven product, endorse-

ment, I hereby dedicate this"
column to “Kieran’s Favorite

Things.” Original, right?

Now, I know that I don’t have a I

scandal-plagued, all-girl’s school
in South Africa, a borderline
creepy relationship with Tyler
Perry or a multi-billion dollar

.media empire, but I hope—you

will grant me the same respect

and adoration that you typically-

reserve for the big 0. If she can
do it, so can I, right‘?

“Under the Dome” by Stephen
King * . I

I amga self—proclaimed King
fanatic, and the latest novel from

to be the literary highlight of I

my Christmas break. Coming in

at more than 1,000 pages, the‘

“Stand”-like epic tells the story of
a town that suddenly ﬁnds itself
closed off from the world by a
giant invisible dome. No one can
get in; no one can get out. I have
only read the ﬁrst 30 pages (3
percent!),ibut7the novel already

promises to include the King
brand of character build up and
sociological intrigue that you can
ﬁnd only in his best work. '

Three Olives Bubble Vodka

Sure, the idea of pairing vodka
(or any alcohol) with bubblegum
ﬂavor initially induces gagging,
and I was certainly a skeptic at
ﬁrst. But after one smooth shot
and a mixed drink comprising the
vodka, Sprite and,cranberry.juice,
I was hooked. It’s fun and origi-
nal, and at $17.99 for a 750 mL
bottle at the Atwood Street liquor
store, it’s a relatively inexpensive
way to start a ﬁin night out.

Everyone has heard of shows

about, yet they never started,

' worth it anymore. For me, it was

ﬂix’s “Watch Instantly” feature,

I.have been able to catch

shows, and I am now scrambling

The Shadyside bar crawl

Come December, the Oakland

British film gives audience ‘An Education’ 

Oxford—b0und schoolgirl comes to a crossroads in coming—of— age ﬂick

Kelsey Shea
Assistant A&E Editor

 

“An Education” -
Starring: Carey Mulligan, Peter
Sarsgaard a

Directed by Lone Scherﬁg

Studio: BBC Films

Grade: A-

: “An Education” is an interesting
twist on a traditional coming-of-age
story that is armed with compelling
characters.

The ﬁlm, based on the memoir of
Lynn Barber, tackles heavy issues like
feminism, the value of education and
the best way to live life.

The lead character, Jenny, is a 16-
year—old English schoolgirl inthe early
’6os on track to study at Oxford.

When David, an older man with
a lot to offer, comes into her life, she
has to decide between adulthood and
childhood as well as whether to be a
student orasocialite. T

._, There is no clear suggestion as to
which lifejenny should choose until
she makes the actual decision — not
even for the audience, which is a rarity
in-theaters these days with the preva-

lence of omniscient viewers.

The conﬂict keeps the audience
engaged in the film and allows them
to stress, rejoice and worry along
with Jenny about the decisions she’s
making.

The strong characters and excel-
lent performancesbycarey Mulligan
asjenny, Peter Sarsgaard as David and
Olivia Williams asJenny’s teacher, Ms.
Stubbs, make the ﬁlm wonderfully
engaging.

Most of the characters are both
believable and likable, adding to the
emotional involvement viewers can’t
help but feel when confronted with
Jenny’s dilemmas.

Jenny is smart (or “clever,” as the
Brits would say), fun and lively, and
David is smooth and seemingly sweet,
even with his sketchy jobs and subtle
secrets.

Jenny’s teacher and principal are
perfectly strong, rigid and traditional
charactersto serve as a parallel to the
fabulous life of cigarettes, jazz music
and adventures that David offers.

The only characters who are dif-
ﬁcult to like, however, areJenny’s par-

ents. Their own infatuation and lack

of inhibition toward David make them

silly and obsolete in_]enny’s life.
Though their irresponsibility
makes them less appealing, theirfaults
further drive the plot and pushjenny
more into the adult world.
The characters and plot are strong,

It seems like an extremely straight-
forward concept —— pairing a genuine
leather belt with a buckle that displays a
condom through a clear plastic screen.
But when you actually wear the belt,
you feel not only like a walking sex-on-
a-stick (because you kind of are), but
also like the most fashionable safe-sex
advocate on campus. The belt comes
in blackand hot pink, and includes the I
insanely cool ONE condoms — stylish
prophylactics with round packaging any
hipster would be proud of.

Pre-holiday vacations

Spring-break trips to the beach are over-
rated — too many drunk college students
with poor judgment and even worse vene-
real diseases. That’s why this year, I will
be going on my annual beach trip the week
before Christmas with two close friends,
not hundreds of total strangers. After the
stress of ﬁnals and before the stress of
spending the holidays with the family,
there is nothing better than unwinding on
a beach or in" a ski lodge, tucked away from
the world for a week of pure relaxation. It
may not be as warm in Florida as it would
be in March, but with cheaper rates and
fewer crowds, I think I’ll be just ﬁne.

These are just a few of my Favorite
Things. Others include‘, but are not lim-

how to install works of art, how to critically ‘

Album mixes genres, artists

HORSE ’snew tracks include classic piano, heavy metaland indie vocals

its new album is called Desperate Liv-
ing.

Released in October, the album keeps
the sounds of Nintendocore’s 8-bit video
game keyboards while exploring new av-
enues of metal, punk, classical and experi-
mental music to become what Winneke
describes as “the heaviest prog band of
all time.”

The song “Rape Escape” features clas-
sical pianist Valentina Lisitsa playing a
100—year—old Prokofiev piece written after
the composer’s best friend committed
suicide. .

Even though Lisitsa had never been
asked to play for a heavy metal band, she
gladly agreed to do the project.

-“She played so ﬁercely she broke a
string on the piano,” Winneke said. .“If
you’ve ever seen the inside of a piano,
you’d know how hardthat is.”

Jamie Stewart, from the experimental
indie rock group Xiu Xiu, sings on the
song “Shapeshift.” Originally, he only
planned on helping the band with sound
production, but when Winneke asked him
to sing, he couldn’t resist. .

» “He has the voice of an angel,” Win-
neke said, “and I hope to work with h-_iém
again.” . ’

He said that working with some of the 4

band’s biggest-inﬂuences outside of its
own genre has been “heartwarming.”

The band is currently on tour through
the U.S. supporting Normajean, but with
all its experience on the road, the band
members have no problem supporting
show themselves. ' » 

“In Boise, Normajean didn’t show up,”
and we had to keep playing for a long
time,” Winneke said.

Hopefully when HORSE_the Band takes .

the stage at the Altar Bar on Dec. 7, the:
show will go on without a hitch. ‘

-Panthers won’ttinker with starters

Pitt coach Agnus Berenato will trot out her usual starting five against the Broncos, who play four guards and one forward;

Randy Lieberman
Senior Staff Writer

Even the Pitt women’s basketball
team is getting in the Big East cham-
pionship spirit.

Originally scheduled to play.
Western Michigan University tomor-
row at 2 p.m. in the Petersen Events
Center, the Pitt women will now play
their game at noon, thanks to some
nifty changes in scheduling.

This is to accommodate Pitt foot-

‘balls matchup against Cincinnati
being played at the same time, coach
Agnus Berenato said. i

“We know a lot of people prob-
ably have tickets to the men’s game,
and we tried to accommodate that,”
Berenato said. “People could still
watch the second half of the game -
it’s on national television -— rather
than not watching any of it.

“Forus, to win the Big East cham-
pionship, that’s not just a football
win, that’s the whole Pitt win. We

_yvish coach Dave Wannstedt the best
of luck.”

However, these aren’t the only ex-
pected changes Pitt will implement
for the Western Michigan game.

The Broncos run a four-guard,
one-forward system and will look to
utilize smaller, quicker players inthe
game. Pitt’s philosophy relies on big
post players, which it might have to
pull in favor of quicker defenders.

The hope for the Broncos is that
the more shooters they have on the
court, the better. ‘

“They have a couple really good
shooters, they just spot up, and we’re
going to have to be really aware of
that,” Berenato said. “They play a
lot of guards.” ‘ _

Countering that is Pitt’s size.

Players such as Shawnice “Pep-
per” Wilson, who led Pitt with
13 points in its 89-37 win over
Youngstown State on Wednesday
and stands 6 foot 6 inches tall, must

' dominate the paint again. Beranato

also said that Kate Popovec, who led

Pitt with 12 rebounds and chipped V

in 11 points in the win, must have a
similar effort against the Broncos.
Pitt out—rebo_unded Youngstown

State 56-26. - ‘

“I think that’s the key for us, get
the rebound andrun— one pass, two
pass and score,” Berenato said.

But one thing Pitt won’t do is
change its starting lineup.

Berenato stated clearly that
Western Michigan will have to beat

66....

We don’t want to
change our stuff, we
want to make them
conform to us.

Agnus Berenato

Pitt’s normal starting lineup before
she even thinks about switching to
a smaller lineup.

“We don’t want to change our

stuff, we want to make them conform
to us,” Berenato said. “We’ll have a
game plan to try and get them out
of their rhythm and play really tight
defense. I feel like that we’re versatile
enough to go against [switching to a
smaller lineup] .”

But Berenato said the Panthers
are still thinking about putting in a
lineup thatwould move junior Shayla
Scott to the power forward position,

‘ redshirt senior Sophronia Sallard to

the small forward spot. Junior Ta-
neisha Harrison or redshirt junior
Brittaney Thomas would slide into
the.vacant shooting guard spot.

“We would be able to cover a lot
of territory with those guards,” Ber-
enato said. “But again, we have to put
them into effect on the court.” _

Pitt is building on its perfect start
so far. It has started the season 6-0
for just the second time in the last
seven years.

“We feel like 6-0 is what we
should be. As a ranked team, it’s dif-
ferent, because we’re the ones with

. targets on our back,” Berenato said.

“We’ve neverbeen ranked this early,

No. 19 in the AP and No. 20 in the
coaches’ poll. Everybody Wants to

_ beat us because we’re aTop 25 team.

That’s what’s different.”

Berenato said expectations are
higher to win convincingly as a
ranked team. p  

“We have to continue to get better
and take care of our business,” Be-;
renato said. “We won convincingly
last game, and that’s what we have
to do. We can’t win games by 10,"we
have to work at every possession if
we want to continue to be ready to
play the Top 25 teams when, come
January, we have a lot of them com-
ing up.”

The Panthers defeated the Bron-
cos last year 88-60 behind Wilson’s
15 points and six rebounds.

“We went to their place last
year and beat them on their own
court, and I think they were kind-
of surprised by that,” Berenato
said. “They’re going to be coming
here and wanting to get revenge for
that. They’re a good team. They’re
the type of team you have to watch
out for.” 1

Panthers still learning

Pitt is just starting to develop an identity with an all—new starting lineup

Kyle Craig
Staff Writer

"Ar

With ﬁve new starters and seven
games completed in the season, the
learning process is continuing for
the youthful Pitt men’s basketball
team.

1“ Pitt (6-1) will have another. early

season test tonight against New-

Hampshire (2-2).

Moving into the month of De-
cember, the Panthers are beginning
to develop their identity as a team.

1', Part of that process includes deter-
mining which players can be trusted
to shoulder the offensive load.

So far, sophomore guard Ashton
Gibbs and junior guard Brad Wana-
maker have risen to the occasion and

,,.,.lead the team in scoring.

Gibbs has done most of his dam-
age from beyond the arc, draining
15 3—pointers in 46 attempts while

averaging 15 points per game.
Meanwhile, Wanamaker has been
more prone to slash to the basket
and attack the rim. His aggressive
play generated a41 percent success

, rate from the ﬁeld and an average of

11.6 points per game. ,

It would be easy for the Panthers
to rest on excuses regarding inexpe-
rience and youth. However, that’s
one thing that head coach Jamie
Dixon won’t allow. '

“The [television broadcasters]
come in to me before the game, and
they tell me what we don’t have. I tell
them what we do have,” Dixon said
after Pitt’s double—overtime victory
against Duquesne on Wednesday.
“We have no excuses. We have to play
better, and we will play better.”

One player who has responded to
his increased responsibility is center
Gary McGhee. After playing spar-
ingly during his ﬁrst two seasons at
Pitt, McGhee is now averaging 9.1

points and 7.6 rebounds per game.

Tonight, McGhee will matchup
with New Hampshire’s top scoring
threat, 6-foot—9 Dane DiLiegro, who
is averaging 14 points per game for
the Wildcats. ‘

The Panthers will also have.to pay
close attention to junior guard Al-
vinAbreu and seniorforward Radar
Onguetou, both averaging double-
digit point totals this season.

To add a little sibling rivalry spice

-to the contest, New Hampshire is

coached by Bill Herrion, the older
brother of Pitt assistant head coach
Tom Herrion.

‘ Unforttmately for the older Her-
rion, his teamis 0-2 on the road this
year and is traveling to the Petersen
Event Center, where the Panthers are
119-10 all-time. ‘

This will be Pitt’s last game before
traveling to Madison Square Garden
on Dec. 8 to play Indiana as part of
the Jimmy V Classic.

Gary McGhee will guard Dane Diliegro, New Hampshire’s top scorer.

But this Saturday, N o. 14 Pitt take

_ on the No. 5 Cincinnati Bearcats at g

ence and an automatic_BCS bowl bid.

ow do you help a fan base
move on from losing a sec-
ond team All—American?

Break his records.
So far, running back Dion Lewis
has done a ﬁne job of making Pan-

thers fans erase those tense moments

they experienced when LeSean McCoy
donned a Philadelphia Eaglesihelmet,
cementing the reality that “Shady”
wasn’t coming back. '
While fatalistic onlookers pulled
their hair out trying to negotiate

how Pitt could survive after losing
its most dynamic offensive presence
since Larry Fitzgerald, Lewis arrived
at school a semester early to begin his
own journey.

It didn’t take very long for the
5—foot-8-inch freshman to make an
impact. '

At the conclusion of spring drills,
Lewis had a stranglehold on the start-
ing tailback position.

Even head coach Dave Wannstedt
didn’t expect Lewis to assume the
starting responsibilities in such a de-
cisive manner.

“I felt likewe were going to be
running-back-by-committee this year
with LeSean being gone,” Wannstedt

eSean who? Lewis impresses

said. “I felt like we had a couple kids
that were on the team that could help
us, and we had a couple incoming
freshmen -— Dion Lewis included —
that would contribute. How it all came
together, I wasn’t-sure.”

On openingday againstYoungstown
State, Lewis ran for 129 yards. The
next week in Buffalo, he ran for 190

‘yards, and he hasn’t slowed down.

“I think Dion has been amazingly
consistent from day one in his ap-
proach to practice, games, meetings
[and] everything he does,” Wannstedt
said. "

In 11 games, the Albany, N.Y., native
has accounted for 1,446 rushing yards,
which broke the Big East freshman

Hairdo, heart unites line 2
BY~RANDY LIEBERMAN

I here are many ways for a team to establish
unit)’-

When Pitt’s offensive line decided it .

was time to do so, it took a trip to a hair salon
during a bye week. , '

Pitt’s ﬁve starting offensive linemen —Ase—
niors Joe Thomas, Robb Houser,john Malecki,
redshirt juniorjason Pinkston and sophomore
Lucas Nix —— wanted to look like a single unit.
Their method was to get mohawks.

Malecki takes credit for the idea, as he said
it worked for him in the past. He won a Penn-
sylvania AAA state championship with Frank-

s lin Regional High School in 2005. '

“I rocked the mohawk in high school, and it
worked then,” he said. i v I

Not to mention his mother owns a hair sa-
lon and would cut the
boys’ hair for free.

, As a former offen-
sive lineman at Pitt,
coach Dave Wannst—
edt ' said, “That
sounds like offensive
linemen. They all did

it together, and they unbreakable blonds

our mindset for every day at ‘practice and

Malecki said he knew replacing starters.
center C.J. Davis and left guard Dominic Wil-
liams on the line was going to be aichallenge
during the off-season. Add to it losing running
back Lesean McCoy to the NFL Draft, and the
team had to worry about maintaining a rushing,
attack vital to the offense’s success.

  

“It’s always a challenge when it’s a freshman .

back there to give him less to think about,”
Pinkston said of running back Dion Lewis.

But 'Pitt’s rushing attack hasn’t slipped at
all with Lewis as the running back. Pitt has al-
ready surpassed last year’s mark of 1,808 total

_ rushing yards this year, amassing 2,022 before

its last regular-season’ game.

Part of the credit goes to the offensive line.

“We had to step up with the loss of Shady,”
Male_cki said. “But being blessed with Dion re-
ally helped.”

Behind Lewis’ 1,488 yards and 13 touch-
downs is the offensive line drilling the holes for
him to run through. '

“It’s a two-way street. He makes us look

good sometimes, and other times we do our job
and he looks good,” Houser said.

While the offensive line might be hidden
under Pitt’s running stars, its contributions
shouldn’t go unnoticed in _the passing game.

Behind senior quarterback Bill Stull’s 19
touchdowns and the 10 times he’s been sacked
all year, there’s Pitt’s offensive line giving him
time to throw against pass rushes.

“That’s all stuff
we’re proud of, the
. rushing yards and
sacks given up,” Ma-
lecki said.

It was all the re-
sult of extra work
in the offseason and

I ‘But about those mohawks. Housersaid ev-
ery lineman was all for it as soon as the idea
came up. ’

“We wanted to do it earlier, before the sea-
son, but we didn’t have the time,” he said.

The bye week before Pitt’s game against
Syracuse came and went with no mohawks.

Then, one day the idea came into fruition.

just talking, and we justdid it,” Pinkston said.
The starting ﬁve linemen got them ﬁrst, and
then some of the younger playersjoined in.
It worked for Malecki in high school, and

Pinkston hopes the same charm works this

year.

“I haven’t won a championship since youth
football,” Pinkston said. “It would mean a lot
for this team and this recruiting class.”
