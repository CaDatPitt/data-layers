The University Senate’s Educa-
tional Policies Committee and
Chancellor Wesley Posvar express-
ed their full support of Pitt’s spon-
sorship of a “semester at sea” pro-
gram at yesterday’s Senate Council
meeting. . I

, In expressing his support for the 0

unique." program whereby students
spend a term aboardia ship and are
instructed in international "studies,
Posvar called it “an opportunity to
be truly innovative and creative,
and to create a new mode of educa-
tion.” '

Bysponsorship and the addition’

of a semester at sea to its cur-
riculum, Pitt would replace the
University of Colorado at Boulder,
who are expected to end their con-
nection with the program ’at the
close of the calendar year 1980.
Reasons for the termination of the
contract-between Colorado and the
Institute for Shipboard Education
(ISE) centered on disputesconcern-
ing curriculum and faculty. control.

Posvar smoothed out any fears of

a repeat of the Colorado disputes -

by informing the Senate that the
University will have “total control”
over curriculum and academic
appointments.

“Partnership means the Univer-
sity has full control over all deci-
sions,” Posvar said, making an
analogy between Pitt's possible
relation with ISE and the relations
the medical school faculty hold with
local hospitals.

University commitments to the
program, according to Provost
Rhoten Smith, head of a committee
studying possible affiliation with
_ISE, would consist of providing of-
lice space, an academic dean, an
administrative assistant serving as a
registrar. and a librarian to organize

FMmwmﬁm&mmn0f

the on-board library. In addition,

“an extensive scholars ip

program” would have to "be

developed in order to make_ the pro-

gram a morelaffordable reality “for

Pitt students who couldn’t afford

the proposed $6,500 per term cur-
rent tuition.

Responding to questions concer-
ning the cost of the program to the
University, Smith responded, by
saying it was his “understanding

1 not to hire anew academic clean,

but ‘to’ have it as a rotating position.
“It looks pretty good to say there
wouldn’t_ be any net cost,” Smith _

added.

In addition, _Posvar further
defended the program by pointing
out that the income would cover the
expenditures. '

“It is our determination that ‘the

bottom line of theUniversity will-
not be affected. The downside risk"

financially is minimal,” ' Posvar '

said. , ' .-- _

City Department Recommends Smoke Detectors

The city Department of Housing
recommended Monday that smoke
detectors be required for all living
quarters in Pittsburgh.

Paul Imhoff, director of building

inspections, asked city council to

amend the building code to order
the installation of the devices,
which sound an alarm when smoke
builds up in a room.

Imhoff acknowledged it would be

said the proposed legislation would
mostly affect new dwellingsand
those being rehabilitated.

The proposed requirement has
been recommended by the city’s
Building Code Review Board and

Outer space. Its vastness boggles
the imagination. From there comes
the unexplainable, according to 13
million Americans who have
reported seeing an Unidentified Fly-
ing Object (UFO).

In Pennsylvania there is a group
dedicated to the investigation of
UFO phenomena called the Penn-
sylvania Center for UFO Research
(PCUFOR). The center was form-
ed in 1966 under the name of the
Westmoreland County UFO Study
Group and became the PCUFOR in
1973.

“It became a statewide organi-
zation to provide a place where peo-
ple might report UFO sightings
without fear or ridicule or un-
-wanted,publicity,” according to a
brochure from the center.

Working with police departments

"throughout the state, as well as with

a radio network, the PCUFOR
investigates reports made to them,
analyzes and later shares the infor-
mation with other organizations in
order “to promote public education
«and awareness of the phenomena
and to provide evidence for scien-
tific research within and outside the
Pennsylvania Center.”
The PCUFOR reports that “the
majority of present-day sightings

— prove to be misinterpretation of

natural phenomena—clouds,
meteors, planets, and stars— or
man-made - objects such as
airplanes, balloons and satellites.”

“These should perhaps be refer-
red to as Identiﬁed Flying Objects
(IFO’§)_.”

The PCUFOR classifies reported
sightings into two categories: rela-
tively distant sightings and relative-

fly close sightings (within 200 yards).

The distant category has three
divisions: nocturnal lights, daylight
discs and radar-visuals. The noc-

largest group of UFO sightings. In

The very thought of snakes
scares some people, but many
people would like to learn more
about these surprisingly benign
creatures. Carnegie Museum of
Natural History has just
published a guide which may
alleviate some unnecessary fears
many of us have regarding
snakes. The first in a series of
Educational Bulletins titled,
"Identiﬁcation Guide. to Penn-
sylvania Snakes,” is now avail-
able at the museum. This
publication, and the ones to_
follow, are funded by a grant
from the Claude Worthington
Benedum Foundation of Pitts-
burgh. '
“ldentification Guide to
Pennsjdvania Snakes” is design-
ed as an identification aid. The
author, Dr. C. J. McCoy,
Curator of the Section of Am-
phibians and Reptiles at
Carnegie Museum of Natural
History, has included specific

information such as a detailed
description of each snake’s color

tain species are found. The
snakes have been painstakingly
illustrated by Michael An-
tonoplos, so that even the most
“citified” individual can easily
recognize native species of these
frequently misunderstood rep-
tiles. ’

Some important things that
one learns from this informative
bulletin are that: Pennsylvania
has 21 species of snakes, and of
these only 3 are venomous; that
a snake can be identified from
its shed skin; and that a rattle-
snake’s rattle is really shed skin
which remains at thetip of the
snake’s tail.

The lure of life after death prov-

The topic of risks and financial
consequences in liabilities also arose
during the discussion, and a few
board members emphasized that the
University be careful in its protec-
tion from any liability incurred dur-
ing avoyage.

Posvar said the University was
“assured” that the up-front liabili-
ty is provided by ISE. -

' Smith added that as far as liabili-
ty protection was concerned,
“we’re being as careful as our
lawyers have advised us.”

Both Posvar and Smith agreed

The bodies, including those ‘of
two children and .a 24-year-old
man, were to be kept frozen with li-
quid nitrogen in an underground
mausoleum at Oakwood Memorial
Park in this Los Angeles County
town‘, in the hopes that someday
those people would live again.

But even if cryogenics—or
cryonics, as the society dubbed its
process——is someday perfected,
these nine people will never be
revived.

“People will believe in it until it’s

that timely settlement of the
negotiations was of the essence,

cording to Posvar, “there is,

In further. business, Posvar said

during the Chancellor's report that
I the new state budget appropriations

“may be acted-upon very soon.”

The state house Appropriations
Committee held hearings on Pitt’s
appropriations in March, but as of
the end of April, the state senate
Appropriations Committee still had
not scheduled hearings to vote on
the matter. ‘

“We’r'e hopeful of appropria-

Newport Beach attorney Robert

“Everyone knew that it was an
experimental venture. What hap-
pened was that the heirs made pro-
mises of a financial nature and they
didn’t keep them and the society
had to shut- off the care system,”
Winterbotham said.

_John Hager, a Los Angeles at-

 Come To Aid

0fAniiassador

By The Associated Press -

Right-wing demonstrators block-
ing U.S. Ambassador Robert White
from leaving his official residence
were dispersed Monday by U.S.
Marine guards who threw three tear
gas grenades at the crowd, an em-
bassy spokesman reported. He said
there were no injuries.

The spckzsman, Howard Lane,
said thCI'L were about 30 demon-
strators in front of the am-
bassadorial residence “when the
Marines tossed the grenades at 5
a.m., and White then left on the
15-minute drive to the embassy.

Rightists, numbering up to 3,000
at some times, began their demon-
stration Saturday afternoon, saying
they would not allow White to leave
unless the government freed former
Maj. Roberto D’Abuisson. He was
imprisoned about a week ago for
allegedly plotting a coup against
Salvador’s centrist civilian-military
junta.

Lane said the United States
recognizes the rights of all people to
peaceful protest “but holding a

. diplomat hostage in his residence is

an act of violence and a crime

— against international law—in El

Salvador just as in Tehran.” He
referred to 53 Americans held
hostage in Iran since Nov. 4.

He said the demonstrators “real-
ly didn’t know what to expect”
when_.the Marines acted and that
White was never directly threatened
with physical violence. _

Marine guards are- assigned
regularly to the ambassador’s
home, in a residential area on the
edge of San Salvador, Lane said,
but “there were a few more on duty
lastnight.” He gave no figure.

Only a small group of rightists
had, remained in front of ., the
building overnight, but others had
said they would return at 6 a.m.,
and that was why the ambassador
decided to leave for the embassy at
5 a.m., Lane said.

After White left, about 10
demonstrators returned and‘ re-
mained through the afternoon,
shouting such slogans as, “Down
with human rights:” “Long live
Reagan:” “Carter is a commie:”
arid “White is red:”

There was no immediate com-
ment from the junta of three
civilians and two army colonels,
which has been under fire from
both left- and right-wing extremists
since it replaced the conservative
government of President Carlos
Humberto Romero that was ousted
in a coup Oct. 15.

Police said only that White left
for the embassy “as usual” Mon-
day morning. r

Block Bani-Sadr Frolml-Naming Prime Minister

Islamic Fundamentalists Increase

Lead In Iranian Parliamentary Voting

By The Associated Press

Islamic fundamentalists increased

their lead Monday in Iranian parlia-
mentary voting and apparently
handed Iranian President
Abolhassan Bani-Sadr another
defeat by blocking his efforts to
name a prime minister. The hard-
liners’ growing influence could fur-
ther complicate the U.S. hostage
crisis. » »

Tehran Radio said 229 of 247
seats in the Iranian parliament have
been filled and that the Islamic
Republican Party has won 113 of
them, including ‘three decided Mon-
day. Victories by Moslem funda-
mentalists running as independents

Iran’s revolutionary leader,
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, has
said the new Parliament, expected
to convene in the next few weeks,
will decide the fate of the 50
hostages held since last Nov. 4..
Many IRP members have ad-

. vocated spy trials for the Americans

end to the hostage standoff so Iran
can devote more attention to its in-

ternal problems. But candidates he ,

supported finished far behind the
IRP in the parliamentary balloting,
and the Iranian president, elected
overwhelmingly last J anuary, ap-
pears to be facing a harder time
than ever taking full control of his
country. "

Observers saw the clergy-

sdominated Revolutionary Council’s

failure to name a prime minister
during the weekend as yet another
setback for Bani-Sadr. The coi;_ncil
was reported to have debated the
appointment of a prime minister for
several ‘hours Sunday before turn-
ing the matter back to Khomeini.

On Saturday, the Tehran
newspaper Bamdad said Bani-Sadr
would appoint a prime minister and
Cabinet within a week and that the
new government’s first duty would
be to try to resolve .the U.S. - Iran
crisis.

But another newspaper, Ettelatt, '

elaborate on the “developments,”
but when the council took up the
question Sunday, Bani-Sadr was
apparently blocked once again.

The prime minister’s office has

~ been vacant since Mehdi Bazargan

resigned after the seizure of the
U.S. Embassy and American
hostages 191 days ago Monday.

Observers believe Bani-Sadr’s
appointment of his own man as
prime minister would strengthen his
political position, particularly if the
choice had Khomeini’s backing.

The Parliament was originally to
have been composed of 270
members. But run-off elections in
23 districts were postponed because
of unsettled conditions or charges
or irregularities in the first round of
voting March 14. It is not clear
when those seats will be filled. But
the constitution provides that the
legislature can convene as soon as
two-thirds of the 270 seats are fill-
ed.

Pitt News surr Writer

Decriminalization of marijuana
beyond the eleven states that have
already lessened penalties for
possession is an uphill battle for the
active lobbyists involved in chang-
ing marijuana - legislation, and
legalization of the drug stands as an
unatainable reality in view of pre-
sent congressional sentiments. ‘

However, the proponents of
marijuana legislation have found
out for the past ten years that the

“move to decriminalize marijuana is

a much more effective ﬁght if done
through the proper legal channels.
One such group which has realiz-
ed the advantages of strength in
organized numbers is the National
Organization for the Reform of
Marijuana Laws (NORML).
Organized in October, 1970, by
Larry Schott, NORML started in
Wahington with the same
philosophy and goals it holds now;

  

 

to remove the criminal penalties. any Cll1€Sti0ﬂS'f€f€ffing t0 mari-

associated with marijuana.

Since then, NORML has grown
into a major national lobbying
force in the pursuit of its orignal
purpose, acting as a central infor-
mation source, and as a medical,
legal, and social referral service for

juana.

Serving on NORML’s advisory’
board are such notables as Geraldo
Rivera, Dr. Benjamin Spock,
Senator Phillip Hart, and Senator
Jacob J avits.

“The senator has been a co-

sponsor of a bill that would
decriminalize marijuana,” said an
aide to J avits. “In his role as a chief

isponsor, he has been one of the

focal points for support. NORML
comes to him for /congressional
suport.”

But_ beyond what makes up

dedicated individuals and groups
who form the many state level ex-
tensions of the organization.
Philadelphia is home of the Penn-
sylvania affiliate of NORML, head-
ed by the Rev. William B. Deane
J r., who is assisted in his role as Pa.
coordinator by Bob ‘Pisani.

“-We’re primarly' a consumer
oriented group,” said Pisani. “We

-spend a lot of time in Harrisburg’

and we’re an information exchange
service.” 1 '

One particualr Pa. NORML
sponsored event which made an im-
pact on the legal medical uses of
marijuana was a public hearing in
Harrisburg on Tuesday, March 27,
1979. ‘

Drive-In Taken

Literally By Man

CAHOKIA, Ill.—An elderly man
recently drove through the wall of
an ice cream shop, climbed out of
his car, and calmly ordered and
consumed an ice cream cone and
soft drink, authorities said.

'~ “He said he wanted an ice cream
cone and Coke and the people were
apparently so taken aback that they

/

served the guy,” said police Lt. Guy
Westbrook.

Several customers were present at
the Dairy Queen when the car hit
the counter inside the building
Thursday. No one was injured, in-
cluding the driver, I a 67-year-old
Cahokia resident.

“When we got there, the guy was
eating the ice cream and drinking

the Coke,” Westbrook said.

.The driver, who offered no ex-
planation for what happened,
finished the cone at the police sta-
tion, where he was ticketed for driv-

ing without a license.

“There’s nothing in the statutes’
for failure to yield to an ice cream‘
store,” Westbrook said.

. Crane Lays Egg

On Mother's Day

. BARABOO, Wis.—How does
Zhurka, a Manchurian crane on
loan from the.Moscow Zoo, know
when it’s Mother’s Day?
Sundaywas the second Mother’s

Day in a row in which oneiof
Zhurka’s eggs was the first one hat-
ched for the season at the Interna-
tional Crane Foundation here.

A wobbly little red-crowned
crane, named Masanobu after the
new director of the foundation’s
Japanese chapter, pecked its way

‘out of the shell at 9 p.m. Sunday.

Only 6 inches tall, Masanobu will
grow as much as aninch a day in in-
fancy and will be three feet tall
within two months, foundation of-
ﬁcial said.

Zhurka, whose species numbers

fewer than 1,000 birds in the wild,

has been the foundation’s “mother

of the year” for producing more
eggs than any of the other dozens of
female cranes here. She laid 14 eggs
in 1979 and set a one-season
foundation record of 16 eggs in

1973. _

NORML Reolizes Strength In Numbers With U\phillFight  

(Continued from page 4)

O blindness.

The hearing was prompted’ by a
petition submitted by the Pa.
NORML, asking the board to ease
access to marijuana by moving it
from Schedule I, or highest poten-
tial for abuse, to Schedule II.

Recent research indicates the

drug may be effective in controlling ~

nausea and vomiting in
chemotherapy patients, as well as
lessening the effects of glaucoma

symptoms. ,
Utlizing the various testimonies

. of marijuana users who smoke the

drug for medical purposes, Pa.
NORML was marginally sucessful
in rescheduling the drug. ,Dr.
Howard Gross of the federal Food
and Drug Adminstration said there
would be no advantage to
rescheduling marijuana, -because
the state still would have to comply
with federal and international laws.
- The organization employs no
paid attornies according to Pasani.

“People call us up and describe
the situation, then we refer them to
an attorney. . .we don’t pay any at-
tornies,” Pisani said.

One step lower on the NORML
hierarchy is found on the various
college campuses, the traditional
rendevous for activitsts and pro-

gressive movements. The University
of Pittsburgh NORML, not af-
filiated with national NORML, was
founded at Pitt on February 1.
1979. With approximately 25
members, the group set out “to
promote decriminalization and
legalization of marijuana, and also
to improve overall public opinion
on the subject of marijuana and
legalization,” according to a
philosophical statement on a stu-
dent organization application.

A lot of the paranoia associated
in joining a group like NORML is
“unjustified” according to Al K.
DeRoy, UPNORML’s advisor and
a research associate in the program
.and proposal development section
of the office of research.

“There are pro’s and con’s to
paranoia these days, people are

reluctant to speak their opinions on .

issues like this,” DeRoy said, em-
phasizing that he was speaking
purely in the role as an advisor to a
student group, and not as a Univer-
sity spokesman.

DeRoy said a major cause for the
little support given at Pitt was due
to ‘ ‘a number of sound

demographic” reasons. Citing the -
background as‘

typical student
“working class, job oriented, career
/minded,” DeRoy wasn’t suprised

that many Pitt students would be
less willing to come forward.
DeRoy said the major reason
NORML has been so effective in
reforming legislation at the national

level is due to the “rational pro- '

position” the organization takes.
“Hysterical support is not a good

position to take,” DeRoy said.

DeRoy doesn’t,view NORML as
a radical political subversive
organization comparable to the
Black Panther Party or the Com-
munists, but rather as a “citizens
action group.” . _

I'm sure it’s a liberal organiza-

tion, comprised of the abortion or
pro-choice type of people. . .it’s a
lobbying organization with a pretty
good point of view.” 

Lack of support and inactivity on
the Pitt campus has recently led to
the extinction of UPNORML.

Compost Toilet
OK For Family

CONCORD, N.H.—The State
Supreme Court ruled Monday that
a Westmoreland Quaker family
may continue to live in a home with
dry compost toilet in violation ‘of
town zoning that requires a septic
tank. -

The court said the zoning board
cannot demand a septic system for a
house that has no running water,
plumbing or electricity.

The family built the house “in ac-
cordance with their religious beliefs

and the doctrine of simplicity in liv-
ing,” the court said. The home’s
dry compost toilet was approved by
the state water pollution control
agency.

Recently, the Big Four auto makers -- General
Motors, Ford, Chrysler and American Motors --
along with the United Auto Workers Union (UAW)
have been lobbying in Washington for relief from
foreign competition.

High gasoline prices have forced many Americans
to get rid of their Detroit gas-guzzlers in exchange for
fuel efficient imports. Despite high interest rates on
loans, foreign car sales are on the rise.

The lobbyists argue for such measures as tariffs of
imported automobiles and breaks from the govern-
ment on regulations imposed a few years ago, that set
the pace for American automobiles to become more
fuel efficient. '

The lobbyists don’t seem to realize what-a favor
foreign automobile makers are doing for this coun-
try. The only sensible way to stretch available energy
resources is to use less of it. Something that the rest
of the world has been doing for years and Americans

have been finding Out. -

Doing away with competition is not the answer for
the dilemna imposed upon auto makers in this coun-
try.

If you can’t beat them, then join them. This is just
what the boys from the Motor City.need to do. In-
stead of worrying about the prestige luxury
automobiles, the Big Four should be channeling all
their efforts toward producing a product comparable
to their foreign counterparts. "

As gas prices continue to rise -- with an added
boost from Carter’s ten cents per gallon tax on
gasoline that goes into effect Thursday -- the demand
for better built, fuel conserving autos will increase.

If Detroit automakers plan to turn from loss to
profit as well as have thousands of their.workers
return from layoffs, then they should plan to meet
this growing demand fully within the next several
years.

The Federal Uniform Crime Code  Death Penalty

By BARRY GLUNT
Pin News smrr Writer

To start with, summer is an in-
teresting time. Most of us look for-
ward to it from afar, relish in the
first days of sun and new routines.
But, for me, summer is much like
school has always been: it’s nice for
awhile but it’s boring toward the
end. It's the long hot summer, the
breezy hot night, the highway
dreams, and summer jobs. Summer
is the time when the (white) majori-

L ty of Pitt students split. Me? I go

year round. I’m in the minorities.

Summer fever is such a part of
the American Dream it even per-
vades the highest level of corporate
activity and government. The

University of Pittsburgh is a fine ex-
ample. Pitt functionaries are well
paid over the summer months to
hike tuitions, centralize student ac-
tivity fees, and ax editors. In addi-
tion, real attention needs to be paid
to the U.S. Congress. They too
seem to he possessed; doing their
darkest deeds as another disco night
descends over the city.

Not that. these things happen
overnight. On Dec. 4, 1979, the
Senate Judiciary Committee,
chaired by presidential candidate
Edward Kennedy, reported out two
bills to the senate ﬂoor. They are
due to be voted on sometime soon.
They are the Federal Uniform
Crime Code and Death Penalty;

V reached, should be included.

Letters in-

‘Z21

 

numbered S.l722 and S.l14, res-

pectively, but just remember S-1.
This is the third time a version of

S-1 is making its way to a senate

_vote. S.1722, like its predecessors

S.1743 and S’-1., is being sponsored
by northern “liberal” Kennedy and
arch conservative, ax-handle
weilding, Georgia Senator "Strom
Thurmond. Malcolm X once said:
“What’s a Dixiecrat? A Democrat.
A Dixiecrat is nothing but a
Democrat in disguise.” If you want
to understand that statement, just
look at some of the provisions of
S.l722.

-—‘It would allow any federal
judge to imprison any person,
merely on the statement of .a
(federal) policeman that “This is
not a capital offense,” “I know this
person (to be such and such),” and
“This person is dangerous.”

—Anyone picketing in front of
an Induction Center_, a post office
or other Federal office building or
legislature would be subject under
Federal law to fines and imprison-
ment ranging from six months to
five years. '

—Any property damage that
takes place at a nuclear facility or
any other energy production or dis-
tribution plant would become a new
Federal crime. When combined

with already existing and new con- .
spiracy laws, a broken link in a_

chain fence around a nuclear power
plant under construction could land
you In prison for five years and slap

 

an organization with a fine of one
million dollars. '

' —Journalists could face similar
fines and prison sentences if they
disclose any government informa-
tion and had a purpose other than
informing the public, such as
revealing corruption or inﬂuencing
government policy.

Many of the provisions iI,LS—l722
are already on the law books, they
are simply restatements or
recodifications of existing laws. But
recodification itself is significant.
Consider that the ERA won’t
change one law on the books. Each
law will have to be challenged and
fought in the ‘courts. Notice that in
the case of S.1722 the congressmen
went to the trouble of re-drafting all
the laws instead of seeking to repeal
the Bill of Rights.

However, many of the provisions
of S.l722 are entirely new, such as
the sections directed against the tac-
tics of the Movement for a Non-
Nuclear World. S.1l4, the Federal
Death Penalty, also contains some
new laws. The Death Penalty Bill,
sponsored by Thurmond alone, but
with the open co-operation of Ken-
nedy (who allowed only two
minutes of debate on S.ll4 in the
Judiciary Committee), is due to be
passed along ,with S.l722. It
reinstates the death penalty for such
crimes as rape, murder, and kid-
napping. But it authorizes, for the

 

first time; the death penalty for two
crimes: espionage and treason dur-
ing peace time. Oddly enough,
“war” itself is never deﬁned in
either bill. A federal death penalty
sets a national policy of state sanc-
tioned executions, which becomes
all the more ominous when you
consider that blacks made up 44
percent of all draft-resisters during
the war in Indochina, and 80 per-
cent of all those executed or waiting
on death row (100‘percent of them
are poor). Consider further that
black people have successfully used
the tactics of civil disobedience to
gain “redress of grievances.” Add
it all up and what do you get?

Will we be “good germans?”
Will we write to “our” U.S.
Senators Heinz‘ and Schweiker, and
demand that they vote against the
bill, demand that they send you a
copy so you, at least, can read it?
They voted for it last time, but if
they get ten letters from Pitt, they'll
think it’s a revolution.

Will we=be “good students?”
Will we start caring about our
education in this fine university?
Who, after all, schooled the politi-

cians?

In First Playoff Finals Game  

‘ By The Associated Press

UNIONDALE, N.Y.——At the
time, it seemed a forgetable 4-0 vic-
tory in a forgetable regular
season—lit/tle more than two points
in the National Hockey League
standings for the New York

‘Islanders. ,

Oh, it snapped a six-game winless
streak and a string of nine games
without a victory on the road. Still,
it was only Dec. 2, a microsecond in
an 80-game campaign. '

“But that night in Winnipeg,”
said right wing Bob Nystrom, “we
were probably the happiest people
on earth. We started to face the
fact that, hey—we’re going to have
to work and be in close games and
play our style when the games are
close.”

The lesson learned only takes
importance now, -as the Islanders
head for Philadelphia to face the
Flyers tonight in the opener of the
first playoff final of New York’s
eight—year history. .

“The losing and adversity we fac-
ed early in the season were the best
things we could face,” said
Nystrom. “It was a bunch of guys
who have a lot of pride—guys who
didn’t want to lose and wanted to
find out why they were losing.”

The Islanders have spent the last
six summers being told why they
lost. Each May, when two other
teams were grappling for the
Stanley Cup, the Islanders heard
every reason imaginable. ‘

Nystrom recited the littany:
“They aren't physical enough.
They lack intensity going into the

corners. They depend too much on

one line. They choke.”

“We were asked questions and
gave honest answers,” says center
Bryan Trottier. “Then we’re called
analysts—even crybabies.

“Now, we’re tired of it. We just-

want to play hockey. We want to
win and we’re having ‘a good time
doing it.” '
Because of one victory in Win-
nipeg? Not totally, just partially.
“Now, when we’re behind, we
just keep going and going, playing

the same style,” says Nystrom. “At

the beginning of f'..e year, when the
other team scored to go ahead,
forget about it. We sort of died.’ It
was, ‘Oh, gee. Not again:’

"Now,-. when that happens, the
next line says," ‘Hey: We’re going to
do something about this.’ ”

And the next line can do
something about it now, becausea
dimension has been added. It’s
called ﬂexibility,
playoff season it had been sorely
lacking from the Islanders’ attack.

“We’re a very versatile club
because we’ve practiced
versatility,” says Coach Al Arbour.

“The guys have gotten used to
playing with different centers, and
the centers can play with any wings.
What’s more, the guys like it.”

A major development in that
regard camé March 11, when New

York obtained center Butch Goring
from Los Angeles for forward Billy
Harris and defenseman Dave
Lewis. By dealing two longtime
Islanders and fan favorites,'General
Manager Bill Torrey made it clear
he would stand pat no longer.

“In the past,” said Torrey, “we
didn’t ‘have what it took. We
analyzed our weaknesses and did
something about them.”

That led to the moves that made
the difference for the Islanders.

In Goring, New York found a
strong skater, penalty killer and
playmaker who could take some
weight off Trottier’s shoulders. In
Gord Lane obtained from
Washington last December, they
got a steady but physical
defenseman. In Olympian Ken
Morrow, they gained balance and
depth on defense.

In Anders Kallur now injured
they added a digger who would not
shy away from the contact in the
corners. and in 19-year-old Duane
Sutter, who started the season in
junior hockey, New York got a
hard-nosed right wing whose play
was mature beyond his years.

Arbour played mix-and-match
and the new players meshed with in-
cumbents that included scoring
phenom Mike Bossy, star
defenseman Denis Potvin, left wing
Clark Gillies and the goaltending
tandem of Bill Smith and Glenn
Resch. Before long, the years of

‘In Cup Fincils

self-doubt were washed away by an
overdue flood of self-respect.

“The confidence is instilled,”
says Potvin. “It’s not something
‘you have to work at to get—it’s
there. ‘

“We’ve proven to ourselves we
can come from behind, we can hold
the lead, we can play tough, we can
play a skating game,” he con-
tinued. “We can do anything, and
I think that’s the sign of a cham-
pion.”

‘‘We’re ‘a proving to ourselves
we’re as good as the talent we
have,” said Gillies, the 6-foot-3
hulk. “Before, the talent was there,

but I don’t think we believed in .

ourselves.’ ’

The years of playoff frustration
may well have had something to do
with that. In their third season,
after winning 31 of 156 games in the
first two years, the Islanders started
taking strides.

They startled the New York
Rangers in the preliminary round,

- winning the decisive third game on

an overtime goal by Jean-Paul

— Parise that remains the .fastest in

history—l1 seconds. Then they
became the second team ever to win
a best-of-seven series after losing
the first three games by ousting the
Pittsburgh Penguins in the quarter-
finals. -

LOS. ANGELES—In every life
there are turning points, special
moments that shape a person’s
direction for the remainder of his
years. i

For ‘Jim Chones of the Los
Angeles Lakers—who meets the
Philadelphia 76ers tomorrow night
in the fifth game of the National
Basketball Association’s champion-
ship series—one of those moments
came when he was a 10th-grade stu-
dent in Racine,_Wis.

“I was in a program which was
designed to provide motivation for
youngsters from poor families,”__
recalled the 6-foot-ll, 220-pound
Chones, who doubles as the Lakers’
starting power forward and reserve
center. '-

, One day, football star Willie
Davis of the Green Bay Packers
came to speak to Chones’ youth
group. ‘

“Imagine, a star like that driving

three hours each way -to see us—a .

group of kids," said Chones.
“Here he was, a legend trying to
help some youngsters. I was never
so impressed with anybody in my
life.

"My father always told me, ‘Jim,
you ‘gotta make it.’ Things- were
tough in my family. I‘ learned that
failure is the key to success. Willie
Davis’ visit really helped i;ne.”

Chones never forgot the impres-
sion Davis, the famous athlete,

made that day, and wherever he has
gone, he has tried to have a similar-

ly positive influence on youngsters.

“It’s something I’ve always
wanted to do,” says the 30-year-old
Chones, who played college ball at
Marquette, spent two years in the
American Basketball. Association
and five with the Cleveland
Cavaliers of the NBA before going
to the Lakers last summer. He also
has been one of the team's most ac-

 With Winning   Edge

By JOHNETTE HOWARD
Pitt News Staff Writer
- The Pitt baseball team concluded
the season last week with a split of
thier last two games to preserve
their second consecutive winning
season. -
The Panthers lost at Bucknell 9-3
last Wednesday then bounced back
at Gettysburg on Tuesday to win
7-6 with a ninth inning rally. Pitt
ended with a 14-13 mark.

Tim Moran, normally a l’ell€I pit-
cher, got the spot start for the Pan-
thers against Bucknell and pitched
five innings before getting into a
jam and giving way to reliever Larry
Lamonde in the sixth. Lamonde
went the last three innings for Pitt
as Moran picked up the loss.

Moran was pressed into the star-
ting role when several of the Pan-
thers’ regular starters were suffering
from sore arms. According to head

(ZONE CHARGES» ADDITIONAL.)

 

cuach Bobby Lewis, Moran pitched
“very credibly” under the cir-
cumstances, and the five innings
Moran pitched were a personal
single-game high for him all season.

Lewis said overall, the team
<1i.<1n’t play well against Bucknell
and had a tough day at the plate.

“We managed to hit the ball well
against them but it seemed all our
hits were right at them, while they
gotsome breaks with balls falling if
for hits,” said Lewis.

Against Gettysburg, ‘things
managed to fall in place for Pitt as
they earned a come-from-behind
victory in the top of the ninth.

Senior Don Koller started for the
Panthers, despite a sore arm, and
pitched ﬁve strong innings before
“exiting when Gettysburg went
ahead in the sixth, 4-1. Allan
Lachowiczentered to pitch until the
eight giving up only one additional
run in his three inning stint.

Lachowicz was lifted for a pinch-
hitter in the top on the ninth with
Pitt trailing 5-2. The Panthers pun-
ched out five hits, including a key
double by Rich Kline to score two
runs, and an RBI single by Chuck

. Mesiano to take a 7-5 lead. Tim

Schwadron hit into a force play to
drive in the other run.

Gettysburg scored one run in the
bottom of the ninth, but fell short
of knotting the score by stranding a
runner on base as Pitt held on to
win 7-6.

Lewis called the game a “fitting
way to end theseason” for the
team, winners of seven of their last
nine contests going into the final
two games. Pitt ended with a 1-3-7
record in northern play _after 3
dismal 1-6 start on their early

season southern tour.

Lewis said he was pleased with

the team results this year but regret- I

ted the Panthers were rained out of
17 of their scheduled games.

“Overall, we did well this year
but I would’ve liked to have gotten
in more games this season.” said
Lewis. “Interruptions from the
poor weather and final exams
makes it hard for the players to get
into their rhythms and keep swing-

ing the bat well. \

“I think, had we been able to
play more, the team would’ve been
able to reach and maintain their
consistency sooner,” Lewis added.

“But any time you sweep
doubleheaders from good teams
like Penn State and West Virginia
within a week as we did at the end
of this season, you have to be pleas-
ed.”

In a teamvote, junior infielder

Chris Mahalik was named captain
for next year and junior shortstop

, Mark Massa was named the Pan-

thers’ Most Valuable Player this
season.
