their‘ present courses and sec-
tions unless very_ good reason
for changes are presented. _

some other form.

Living Come from Living
First Montagu tries to ﬁnd a

biological basis for man’s belief

in immortality. He takes as his

‘premise the statement that all

living things come into being
from other living things.

In this way it 'is merely an
unconscious memory of that per-
iod of gestation when each man
was intimately a part of the ma-
ternal “genitor.”- The ﬁrst situa-
tion which man in his pre-natal
state encounters is a social one.
social

death has occurred. .
LI-Iis _second point .bio1ogi_ca1ly

  

association, man’
, wishes _to. continue even after.

 

'Thus, if the body dies, the

_soul also-dies. This theory would

reftfte the belief -in immortality
where the soul leaves the body.

Then, what are the bases for
man’s long and loyal belief in‘
immortality? Beginning with the
Neanderthal man’s bringing his

corpses intothe home cave, an-_ ~
cient societies have manifested _

their belief in immortality by
taking caI‘e»of_ their dead. ‘

L‘ Take Care or Dead .

This came from the idea that
the spirit of the dead would not

’ have rest unless they were taken

care of and not left in‘ "the ﬁeld

‘. to die. The primitivepeoples held

the belief as James Frazer said,

. not as a‘ speculation of hope or

fear" but as a certainty beyond
doubt.‘

Man is unhappy on earth and .

immortality is his answer to
death as far as the “illiterate”
society goes. However, Montagu
maintains, where does the belief
in immortality stem ‘from in
modern society? 1 _

Essentially, we _are given the
same answer. Man is looking for
a haven of perfect happiness. On
earth he realizes it isn’t attain-
able. It helps to alleviate-present
pain when we think of future
Joy. . .
Is this belief a myth, a delu-
sion, or what is its=hope for
modern. man? ‘

This Montagu attempts to an-
swer in his third and last lec-
ture “Immortality and Ethics.”
Ethics here means the conduct
of man. Immortality in Western
society is directly associated with
how man behaves in this world.

We are trained that if we are
good, we will go to heaven; bad,
to hell; Thus the belief in im-
-mortality is a partial‘ regulation
of human behavior.
‘ Montagu » maintains

ings; ,One_ can w._aste,_thi_s -life in

 

. valuein reference '50 the latter: .
“In short the belief in immor-
tality has, ‘on the whole, served“

to make‘ men better than they
are.”

1

Now, Mpntagu is ready to pre- ,

sent’ to us his view of immor-
tality of modern man. He claims
that it is ‘the wonder of thought
that it can be disembodied and
influence men forever afterward.
Thus man ‘does earn immortalit7y
-—_ the type in which men’s‘soul_s
live in their thoughts, their deeds
and their words. . ~ .' .
This is Montagu’s immortality,

He closes his provocative book"

;with a presentation of George
Eliot’s poem, “Oh, may I join
the choir invisible,-” where she
too agrees with this immortality

by repute. She speaks of those ..

immortal dead who live again

in minds made,‘ better by their-‘

presence. _

Whether the reader wishes to
accept Montagu’s theories on im-
mortality is up to time. As he
says, the belief in immortality

is an act of faith. We are not

sure of anything in mortal exist-

ence. Thus each one must strive‘

in this life to perpetuate. the
ideals which he thinks are noble
and beautiful enough “to be to
some other soul, the cup of

strength in some great. agony.’-"

Game of the Week.

JOHN FLARA, left, is about to haul in a Bill Kaliden pass and
score the ﬁrst Panther touchdown near the end of the first half. The
halfback got behind Captain Pete Dawkins (24) and Glen Adams

(11) to make the over-the-head catch.

ALMOST half the Army defense was needed to bring down Halfback Curt Plowman as he broke
through left guard ‘on a double reverse in the third quarter and rambled to the Cadet 44. The play
was good for a ﬁrst down and helped but the Panthers on their way to the tying touchdown, which
was scored on a pass from Ivan Toncic to Jim Zanos. Dick Haley then caught a Toncic pass for

two points.

   Plehes Hand Fresh
irst Setback, 2'5 -6

_ _ By _JACK SMITH -
, Navy’s Plebes handed the Panther freshmentheir ﬁrst
setback of the season by a score of 25-6 last'Friday, Oct. 24,

at Annapolis. ,

\

Quarterback Dick Sanker set up the Panthers’ only

touchdown in -thehfourth quarter-.on a 40-yardpass play _to.
-Regiss Welsh. Second later Halfback

_C from the tiwo-yard line.
Navy‘ capitalized on blocked
punts and fumbles in gaining their
25 points. The Plebes went for a
touchdown in the ﬁrst quarter, two
in the second, and one'in the third.
They made only one conversion.

According to Cecconi his team
played a good game. “I feel that
the -team played well,” he- said.
.“The -main trouble seemed to be
that Navy had, our team com-
pletely scouted. No matter what.
our offensive unit did they seem-
ed to know how’ to stop it.

,“On pass plays we have our

guards pull out; every pass we
would try they would shoot ‘the
"gap and hit our quarterback. On
defense they completely fooled us
by using the new Army offense.
\ “Of course we were totally un-
prepared to cope with it. I do not
consider the loss due to the team,
but rather to a deﬁcit on the part
of the coaching staff. I’m sure the
team will be uprfor the next
game.” ~

The fresh record now stands at
1-1. Their next opponent will be

Booters’‘Los-e , ,
Fourth Straight
To Cadets, , X

By Ted Colton

The Panther booters went down.
to their fourth straight defeat Sat-
urday to the Cadets of West Point.
by the score of 2 to 0 This was
"the fifth’ loss in six games and the
third time this year that the Pan-
thers have been shut out.

Army scored its ﬁrst goal with
only four minutes remaining in
the game. The score came on a
shot—by the Cadets inside-righ‘t
Pete Chappeal, who pushed the
ball by the Panther goalie who
had slipped on the muddy turf.

_ The Cadets came right back at
the Panthers and scored their
second goal only a minute later.
This time it was Dick Powell‘
-who came through for the Vvest
Pointers. ' V '

The Panthers battled the Cadets
evenly through three periods on
the rain-drenched ﬁeld; The Blue
and G old ‘were on defense
throughout most of the ﬁrst half
and were able to hold Army score-
less on some fine plays by goalie

Ron Goga.

More buxom blondes with
