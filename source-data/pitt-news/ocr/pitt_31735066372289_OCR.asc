Holds Meeting on Curriculum Reform

SGB Suggests Changes  

By CHRIS CLINTON

The Student Government Board
yesterday endorsed the presentation
of a student-formulated alternative
to the proposed College of Arts and

. Sciences curriculum reform.

The SGB-endorsed proposal will
be presented by student members of
the CAS and Faculty of Arts and
Sciences councils at a meeting ofthe
FAS tomorrow at 9:l5 a.m. in L-9
Clapp Hall.

ldeas for the student curriculum
reform proposal were compiled
Wednesday night at a special SGB
meeting at which interested students
could take a stand on the proposed
reforms)

The student FAS and CAS coun-
cil members will meet today to dis-
cuss the ideas. make any changes
and finally arrive at a set of their
own proposals to take before the
faculty tomorrow.

At SGB‘s Wednesday night meet-
ing. the attending board members
said they agreed with the philosophy

of curriculum reform. They added.
however. that they were unsure
about the fine points ofthe proposal
that has been advanced by the CAS
Committee on Curriculum Reform.

Alternatives to‘ the curriculum
reform committee’s proposal that
were endorsed by SGB include:

0 Maintaining the current foreign
language requirement (a two-year
study of a foreign language in high
school or two terms ofcollege study)
but having it enforced by the dean‘s
office and the Office of Admissions.

The curriculum reform commit-
tee's proposal calls for either three
years of high school foreign lan-
guagestudy. a passing grade on a
foreign language proficiency exam
or two years of college-level lan-
guage study. -

0 Requiring a minimum of IS
credits in at least four departments
within each of the natural sciences.
humanities and social sciences di-
visions. for a total of 45 credits.

Under the curriculum reform
committee’s proposal. distribution

. order of a little less than inﬂation,’

of studies requirements would con-
stitute a minimum of 39 credits but
would contain more specific require-
ments in each of the three divisions.

A0 Implementing a minimum six-
credit requirement in foreignicul-
ture. These six credits could (but
would not necessarily)tbe in addition
to the 45 that would be needed to

jmeet the distribution of studies
requirement. ‘

The foreign culture courses would
be administered similarly to the“W"

Pitt To Enter Volatile Bond Market

By FREDERICK BEERS

“lt’s one ofthe biggest dice games
going on right now." is how Pitt’s
senior vice chancellor of business
and finance, Joe Dutton.icharacter-
izes the situation in the bond market
today.

WPGH Closer to
FM Status

Getting

By MARY KANE

A proposal to bring an FM educa-
tional radio station to Pitt is one
step---although a distant one-M
closer to reality.

The Federal Communications
Commission has reviewed an appli-
cation from Pitt’s student-run sta-
tion, WPGH, and has assigned ‘an
Oct. 30 “cutoffdate" for any station
wanting to comment on Pitt's appli-
cation.

Larry ‘Lunsford. Pitt’s student
media adviser, was notified of the
decision Wednesday by project con-
sultant Ed Perry.

After Oct. 30. WPGH is hoping to
reach separate agreements with
Carnegie-Mellon’s FM station.
WRCT. and Bethany College's FM
station. WVBC. Bethany and CMU
have filed applications with the FCC
to increase the power ofthcir respec-

_ tive stations. lf Pitt can settle some

technical problems with the stations.
the schools will amend their applica-

tions and return them to the FCC.

Notice on approval of the
amended applications could take
from three months to a year. or
longer. according to Lunsford.

lf the FCC doesn’t automatically
approve the amended applications,
the FCC could call hearings between
Pitt and CM U and between Pitt and
Bethany to resolve the matter.

Since submitting its application in
June l980, WPGH has faced two
mziin problems in its efforts to “go

-There is no room on the dial for
another FM station. There could be
room -for WPGH, however. if
WRCT agrees to move from its cur-
rent location of 88.3 megahertz on
the dial to 88.7. Pitt would be
assigned at 88.l.

The reason CMU would have to
move its position on the FM dial is
that the FCC requires specific sepa-
ration between stations on the dial.

Over the past two years. Pitt and

of two buildings»-— one to house the
Graduate School of Business and
another for a fraternity housing
complex. ,

A bond is simply an evidence of
debt. or an IOU. The government,
corporations and municipalities can

‘ issue bonds, but those issued by the

municipality are tax-free, and there-
fore have lower yields or returns. In
the past, this was aggreat incentive,-
but the municipal bond market no
longer thrives with interest rates as
high -as they are now. V F

“The thing that’s preventing peo-
ple from buying municipal bonds.”
said Jacob Cohen, a Pitt economics
professor. “is the fear that there’s
going to be more inflation.”

A fundamental premise here..
according to Cohen. is that when
interest rates increase, bond prices
decrease. lncreased interest rates are
a direct result of inflation, caused by
an excess demand. .

A representative of Pittsburgh
National Bank, who wished to
remain amonymous, explained the
relationship that‘s keeping investors
away from the bond market.

“Suppose you buy a $|0O bond
with an 8 percent interest or ‘cou-
pon’ rate. A year later the interest
rates increaseito I0 percent. Now if,
you want to sell that 8 percent bond
to reinvest in the higher yielding l0
percent market. you’ll have to sell it
at a loss or discount to persuade the
investor to buy your bond instead of
just going directly to the security
with the higher rate of return."

Many investors have been getting
burned as the rates increased, caus-

mated that inflation would
approach 9 percent ‘in fiscal year
I983. 4

Posvar said. iii an interview this
week. that an increase in appropria- B
tions on the level of inflation would
enable the university to avoid any
“traumatic cuts or changes in the
l980’s." ,.

Posvar also stated that he did not

anticipate any layoffs despite the

fact that several financially-strapped
universities have had to lay off
tenured faculty members.

“I do not expect it.”he said. “I will
do everything in my power to avoid
it.”

The University of Washington in
Washington state, for example.
declared a state of financial emer-
gency in the face of a $33 million
deficit in its two-year operating
budget.

Many facultyjobs have been elim-
inated in state schools in Ohio, Ken-
tucky. Michigan and Idaho. Posvar
described these schools as having
been accustomed to “generous fund-
ing” from their state governments.

“There had been no pressure for
improving management and setting
priorities: and then suddenly their‘
state governments had a fiscal crisis
and a shortage of money.” he said.

Pitt also differs from those institu-
tions in its degree of control over its
finances, Posvar said, citing Pitt’s
independent board of trustees and
its control over fees and salaries.

Pitt is asking the state for $85.5
million in appropriations for fiscal
year l983, an increase of$l0.8 mil-
lion, or l4.5 percent. over the fiscal
year I982 appropriations. Included
in that request is a 5 percent tuition
increase, which could go higher,
depending on what the General
Assembly finally approves for Pitt.

This is the first year that Pitt has
gone into the appropriations process
with a tentative tuition hike already
planned. Penn Statewent into.the
process last year with a 5' percent
tuition hike. which was eventually
hiked to l2.6 percent at the comple-

B tion of the budgeting process.

Commoner Gives Views on Reaganomics

By scor STONE

Those opposed to Reagan-
omics~the intellectuals, the
activists and the bleeders—-come
together in small meeting halls
across the country to talk about
the issues and work out various
plans of actions.

.ln Pittsburgh, the Consumer
Party is perhaps the best organ-
ized of these groups, and on
Wednesday night » I50 party
members and sympathizers
showed up at the Graduate
School of Public Health Audi-
torium to hear Barry Commoner
present his views on the prob-
lems facing America.

Commoner, a respected bio-
chemist and recent Citizen’s
Party candidate for president of
the United States, said that the
basic problem with America lies
inithe nature of corporations.

“We have always relied on cor-
porations to build up the econ-
omy, but their concern is for
profits, often at the expense of
the economy." Commoner said.

Commoner believes that it is
important. to disregard the idea
that “free enterprise can do it
all.” Unlike somepeople in the
Democratic Party who advocate

NAPOLI PIZZERIA

waiting for Reagan’s economic
policies to fail before taking
action, Commoner said that it
must be shown that the presi-
dent”s policies have been tested
already and do not work. Com-
moner feels that to wait for the
total failure of those programs
will leave open the dangerous
possibility of "someone on a
white horse riding into the void
with all the answers."

As an example, Commoner
described the consequences of
Reagan‘s deregulation of the oil
industry.

“With all of this new money,
the oil companies have drawn up
quite a shopping list." Com-
moner said. “The result is not
more oil, but more aquisitions,
like the recent CONOCO deal.
All that did was remove $7.5 bil-
lion from the national pool of
credit, and yielded not a single
new barrel of oil.”

Rather than taking -money
from the poor so that it can be
invested by the rich. Commoner

‘believes that the government

should be working on ways to
make -the economy more effi-

cient. He feels that the first step i

in that direction is to reduce mil-
itary expenditures.

The Pitt News-. Friday. October 9. I 98/

“It is important to realize who
benefits from our military
budget." Commoner said. “It
isn't service people making large
salaries, but the corporations
like Rockwell who sell expensive
hardware and raw materials to
the government."

According to Commoner, this
iswasteful usage of capital since
the output of the military-
industrial complex cannot be
used for productive purposes
such as-creating goods.

According to Commonér,’part
of the solution to these problems
is the construction of a strong
labor-oriented political party
such as The Citi“/.en‘s Party or its
Pennsylvania affiliate: The
Consumer Party. Commoner
said that the response he has
received since his presidential
attempt makes him optimistic
about the future of alternative
politics in America. ’

Commoner’ argues for a new
‘type of populism flavored with
Socialist principles and advo-
cates worker control of capital
and the redistribution of wealth
by the government.

“The economy should provide
for people‘s basic needs, and the
government should work to

secure social justice for its citi-

At the close of his speech,
Commoner referred to a recent
encyclical from Pope John Paul

ll ion the nature of work as a
~significant show of support from
“a man who is concerned about
his followers who are mostly

working people.“

Zingaro Tries Again

John Zingaro, community
activist and local candidate for
the Consumer Party, is on the

I stump again.

7 Zingaro is running for Pitts-
burgh City Council this fall after
a failed attempt to get the seat
vacated by .lerry Coyne when he
won a seat in Congress. Speaking
before recent Citizen's , Party
presidential candidate Barry
Commoner at the Graduate
School of Public Health Audito-
rium Wednesday. Zingaro out-
lined a series of scandals and acts
of ineptitude on the part of city
government that he said, indi-
cated a lack of concern for the
true needs of people living and
working in Pittsburgh.

Zingaro cited the numerous
building code violations against
the owners of the Chances R dis-
cotheque in Oakland before their
building burned over two years
ago, killingtwo people in the

Zingaro is basing his city

issues: that Pittsburgh use its

members be elected by district.
and that jobs be created through
local corporations that are per-

for his campaign from liberal,’ la-

Publish or Perish

By SCOT STONE And MARY KANE

“Publish or perish" is something
regarded with fear and loathing by
some~‘faculty members and with
ambivalance byothers in the univer-
sity hierarchy. lt is a cliche used to

describe one of the processes which
determine tenure.
Whether or not it is a problem.
~"enough people within the academic
community have taken the time to
discuss the concept of publish or
perish to make it an—issue.

With that fact in mind. The Pit!
N(’ll‘.\' decided to look at the situa-
tion from various points of view. .

We sought comments from a Pitt
faculty member. a member of the
administration and the president of
the Association of University
iPrcsscs.

What follows is a compendium of

opinion on the publish or perish
‘phenomenon.

Dr. Otis Walter .

At Pitt. it's hardlgi the case that
teaching and publishing are given
equal weight. at least according to
speech professor‘l)r. Otis Walter.

The necessity of publishing to

maintain one’s academic standing
and qualify for a promotion is so
strong that the cliche of “publish or
perish" takes on an ominous mean-
ing. resulting in quantity ratherthan
quality. ~.

“Ninety—five percent of what is
being published today isjunk." Wal-

-ter said. “Forced publication doesn't
create greatpublicatitin. It creates
junk."

And. according to Walter.
emphasizing the importance of pub-
lication creates a. stifling atmos-
phere. stunting the-academic growth
of thebest and the brightest.

“There's no reward at all for good
teaching." he said.

He also explained that as an
instructor develops. he gains differ-
ent insights. often changing his
thinking. and developing new ideas.
That‘s a good sign. Walter said. But
for the faculty member to gain

“We're firing the best and the
‘brightest before they can develop
new interests.“ Walter said. “We
force them (to publish) when they‘re
about to become great."

Is the idea of publish or perish
really that strong at Pitt‘?

any difference if you’re the finest

Mohammed. and Buddah put
together. You still couldn't even
make assistant professor here.”
_ lt has_n‘t always been that way.
Walter said. I
“There was a time when the pres-
sure‘ wasn't so strong." Walter said.
“You could get to a higherrank by
showing promise of-publication.”
He said that when he began his
academic career. there was time
available for him to shapehis teach-
ing and develop his confidence
before tackling in print new ideas
and theories. . ‘
Now. however‘. “Time to grow is
not permitted." he‘ said. ~
Walter doesn‘t believe that forc-
ing faculty to publish continually
creates a great-university.
“Harvard and MIT never became
great universities by forcing their
faculty to publish. They became
great by having bright minds and.
leaving them alone. not burdening
them with administrative trivia.
The real way to make a great uni-
versity is to bring in these great
minds. like (former Pitt Chancellor
Edward) l.itchfield did and then

create a stimulating. rather than a

repressive environment."

Its not that Walter himself a

rhetoric of ~21 frustrated would-be_

sively. having authored books ‘and
numerous articles. including some
that have been-anthologized. His
book Tlzin/ring and Speaking is
standard fare for almost every intro-
ductory public speaking course at
Pitt. T

It’s just that he doesn‘t endorse
mandatory publication.

Vice Provost

" ‘Publish or perish’ is simply one
of several criteria by which a person
can receive tenure. In some depart-
ments teaching is much more impor-
tant thanresearch or publication; in
other departments. the amount of
money that" one brings in'for spon-
sored research is more important. It
varies from place to place. even
within the same university.

“Publications. however. are im-
portant because whep a scientist. for
example. conducts a research pro-
gram. and he comes up with some
results that are worthy of note. he

_ wants to communicate not to the
public. per se. but to his colleagues .

within the profession. The way that
is done is through ‘a series of vehi-
cles. such asjournals. newsletters or
whatever. that are known by people
in that field and respected by them.
It is through that media for the most
part that the individual develops a
reputation as a quality scholar.

“When ‘a teacher comes up for

'* tenure. we do not simply look for a

few people in the department to say
that he is a great scholar. but we look
beyond the university to people in
that field to makejudgments on the
quality of the individual’s work.

“If. for example. you get someone
from the philosophy department.
and you‘re‘at the University of Pitts-
burgh. and, you can get people from
Manchester. England and Harvard
and Stanford to write letters fofyou
saying‘ that you are doing ,the job.
that you are one of the best-% well.
then everybody inthe world is going
to be impressed by that. That is one
of the reasonsfor publishing.

“Now. the process is not simply
that selfish. l publish because I have
something to say. And I think that
the something that l have to say is
going to be received reasonably well
by my colleagues. and they‘re going
to recognize my contribution.

“Another thing you should take
into consideration is that when a

person is up for tenure. he consid-

\ered as well for the services that he_
performs. within the department of

. the schoolthat he is a"member ofand
the university at large. He may do
this in a variety of ways. by‘servtng
on committees and councils. plus the
contributions he may make to_the

community. Now all of those things_-

are taken into consideration.

_ “From the standpoint of‘one’s'
professional reputation: what is

taken into considerationiis what his
colleagues say about him. both
inside and out of the university.
Publishing- is one way to-gain
respect. -another is the presentation
of scholarly work to conferences like
the American Sociological Associa-
tion. for example. So there are a

number ofthings that are considered 1

_in a person’s petition for tenure.

“I don‘t discount the,importanceiv'
of publication. but what is also true,

is that. in a variety of places.iwhat is:
important is not the quantity ofpub-

lications but the quality of those

publications."

A Donald Ellegood e g . -

President, Association of American University Presses

 "Publish or perish’ is a cliche

the system whereby a person must
conduct research and report on his
findings in order to secure tenure. or

and in theory. I believe in the
process it»-gives you people who are

"As a result of publish or perish.
there is a greater quantity of work
being produced by people in the dif-
ferent fields of study. and. I would
think it contributes in a positive way
to the overall body of knowledge
within that discipline.

“It is hard to generalize about the
extent of this policy in American
universities. because the specifics
vary so much from school to school.
Some schools don't even have pub-

ties. while others expect their

delay “would be very costly to us."

He pointed out that the university
has already “advanced a substantial
amount of money" to the architect

“At the present time." Dutton
said. “it is not our intention to delay

Bond Market To Dice Game

of. according to Dutton. is being
forced into the short-term notes
instead of long-term bonds. These
could run as short as I20 days.

If this becomes reality. as the
initial issues mature. Pitt would
have to issue more bonds or notes.

Penn State. I)utton said. went to
an initial I20-day issue before refi-
nancing with a three year issue for

‘ recent construction.

Dutton said he would prefer to
start with a three—ycar issue followed
by a 22-year refinancing issue. He
compared this to taking out a second
mortgage on a'house. and said it
would probably be better_|ust to go
with a single long-term issue.
Whichever route is chosen, it will
depend on the market rate ofinterest
at the time of issuance. the cost of
the bids and the input ofthe author-
ity and underwriters.

Another option being considered.
according to I)utton. would be to
find other financing for the initial
costs. then later going to the market.

He explained that the contractor
docsn‘t get all of the money at the
outset. but is paid on the basis of
work performed..'l‘hereforc. Dutton
said. “if we’re only going to pay out
over the next four to eight months.
maybe $2()().0O(). we might be better
off borrowing that $200.(l()() now. on
the hopes of going to the market
later."

This “deferraI". Dutton said.
would be based on the hopes of a
better market in the near future and
of better bond issuance costs. such
as lawyer or underwriter fees.

Although it might seem that the
costs would be greater in going to a
loan. Dutton explained that because
of the small amount of money and

the short loan period involved. sta-
tisticaIl_v and numerically. it works
to our advantage  to borrow the
$2()0.()()(l at I9 or 21) percent for that
short period instead of incurring
debt on I3 million or so worth of
obligations that begin on the day of
issue." This. of course. would hinge
on a number of factors including the
bond market interest rate.

Dutton also said that the univer-
sity has other “fallback positions.”
but he did not elaborate. . .

Despite the gloom forecasted by
some investors. [)utton and the
Pittsburgh National representative
both see a drop in the rates by spring
of I982. although botI1a.re cautious.

“Right now.“ Dutton said. “we're
tapping peopIe‘s brains to find out
what the other institutions. inves-
tors. corporate community and
money management are doing."

CMlJ‘s move would cause interfer-

Edito7’s Note: Tomorrow, Pitt faculty may decide to accept or reject
proposals for curriculum reform. The Pitt News asked College of Arts
and Sciences Dean lrwin Schulman, who headed the Committee on
Curriculum Reform, for his views on this subject. Permission was also
asked of former CAS Dean Robert Marshall to reprint his position on
— the reforms. Marshall's column originally appeared in the Faculty of
Arts and Scignces Gazette.»

Reform: An Effort

To Restate Purposes

By IRWIN J. SCHULMAN

Deon, College of Arts and Sciences

No one finds it unusual that our
engineering school. our medical
school or our law school should
have a fairly rigid curriculum. The
beginning engineering student takes
it for granted that the engineering
faculty know what they are doing,
that they are justified in telling him
what courses to take and in what
order. ~

Yet any effort to establish a sim-
ilarly rigid curriculum in a liberal
arts college. such as our College of
Arts and Sciences, would surely
encounter widespread opposition.
Even the fairly modest strenghten-
ing of requirements proposed for
CAS by the Committee on Curricu-

lum Reform has met with controver-
-sy and resistance from some stu-
dentsjand faculty members. V

Why is that‘? The problem is
twofold.

First. hlthough we often say that a
liberal arts college such as ours pro-
vides a liberal education. there is no
clear and commonly shared under-
standing of what that means. Some

‘think of liberal education as a more
or less updated version of the seven
liberal arts of the Middle Ages; oth-
ers think of it as four years of good
conversation; still others think it
means survival training for the com-
puter age.

And. second. there are many who

, reject the very idea of liberal educa-

tion as the central purpose of alib-

eral arts college. Some people think .

that liberal education--whatever

that means--—is obsolete or elitist (a ;;

bad thing).

Others-~ mostly ,

students----think of college as a stop 5-

on the way from high school to a ‘ti

career. and they are uninterested in A

distractions such as literature or phi- 
_ Iosophy. Many ofthem have a hard 
time grasping the notion that college 2

has purposes

other than career
training. ‘

Many faculty members also think 

of. college education as the elemen-
tary phase in the training of people

such as themselves. They are con- :7
cerned with undergraduates as f
potential Ph.D.’s in physics. politi- 5'
cal science or comparative Iitera- 

For them. too.
education is mostly a distraction
from the real business of a college:
the training of academic specialists.

This disagreement about the

liberal

-nature of college education is the
source of many of the problems of

‘liberal arts colleges today: their de-
clining standards. the incoherence
and confusion oftheir curricula. the
blurred image that they project to
the public. the growing doubt that
college education is a “good invest-
ment." These problems will worsen
in the years to come due to shrinking
resources and declining enrollments.
Already many colleges have surren-
dered to these pressures and turned
themselves into career-training
schools.

“Unless our Col-
lege of Arts and
Sciences rediscov-
ers and once again
proclaims its pur-
poses as a liberal arts
college. our decline
is inevitable.”

Unless our College of Arts and
Sciences rediscovers and once again
proclaims its purposes as a liberal
arts college. our decline is inevitable.
Students »don’t want requirements
because we have not yet persuaded
them that we know what we are
doing. Conversely. they will wel-
come requirements-when these are
the clear and persuasive expression
of the College’s sense of mission."
Curriculum reform is really an effort
to recover our self-confidence . re-

state -our purposes and embody

these purposes in the constitutional
arrangements of the College.

Our reform proposals are based
on the premise that CAS is and
should remain a true liberal arts’
college— that is. a college whose cen-
tral purpose is liberal education.
Liberal education here refers to the
intellectual skills and bodies of
knowledge that are essentialto full
participation in the civilized life of
our contemporaries. Three sorts of
justification have typically been
offered in defense of suchia view of
the purpose of college education.

First. there is the notion that col-
lege education serves to introduce us
to our cultural inheritance. The lib-
eral arts college. in this view. plays a
key role in keeping alive our civiliza-
tion from generation to generation.
Americans typically suffer from col-
Iective amnesia: we have little aware-

ness ofour past. College education is
thus an exercise in the recovery of

cultural memory. At many colleges .

this view is reflected in required
courses in the history of Western cv-
ilization. Western literature
philosophy. V _

A second view is that liberal edu-
cation is concerned with the foster-

ing of those intellectual habits that g

enable us to realize our highest pos-
sibilities. These habits--V developed
capacities for reasoning. judgment
and expression-— are not merely cul-
tural adornments; they are
essence of our human nature. This
view has a long history that can be
traced back through the writings of
medieval philosophers to the educa-
tional theories
Aristotle.

A third view is more characteristi-
cally American. Throughout our
history the liberal arts college has
been regarded as the provider ofthat
education which is appropriate.
even indispensable. to citi7.enship in
a free republic. Jefferson. for exam-
ple. thought the connection between
liberal education and the fate of the
American political experiment so
fundamental that he regarded the

, founding of the University of Vir-

ginia as his greatest achievement.

It seems to me thafaI_f'
these arguments have an enduring
cogency. Two other defenses of lib-
eral education. more obviously con-.
nected with the charactcr of the
University of Pittsburgh. may be
mentioned’. At Pitt. as at other large
research universities. the College of
Arts and Sciences is a loose confed-
eration of more or less independent
research-oriented departments.
Only the common concern of the
.faculty with liberal education can
preserve the collegiality of CAS and
its character as a community of
scholars.

On a more mundane level. liberal
education is practical for the stu-
dent. too. The liberally-educated
student is one who ‘is equipped not
just for ajob but for life. In a rapidly

' changing world in which new career

specialties are born every day. while
old ones become obsolete. liberal
education is truly education for sur-
vival. Such -an education is far more
adaptable. ﬂexible and useful than
the kind of training that prepares
one .mcrely for one's first
employment. I

A Defenderof
Open Curriculum
LooksAt Proposals

By ROBERT D. MARSHALL

Associut.» Professor of English

Come to think of it. I guess it is a
good idea that the faculty impose a
more rigid curriculum on the stu-
dents of the College of Arts and
Sciences. That may come as a sur-
prise to those ofyou who remember
me as the dean who was a staunch
defender of the open curriculum. .
But I for one didn‘t have as my prim-
aryipurpose defending the rights of
students to make choices or oppos-

-ing a monolithic definition of the

proper body of study. Rather. I
believed that we ought to make it the
responsibility not of a static devise

like the curriculum but ofth.c“ongo— '

ing" community of the students and
faculty to keep alive the continuing
questions of what a liberal-arts edu-
cation was all about. I believe that.
in the last analysis. the major pur-
pose of a required curriculum is to
relieve the faculty of the burden of
community. And. since the faculty
have soundly rejected that burden in
recent years. there probably ought
to be a required curriculum.

]

administration. as people were wont
to say. By the faculty. I was a dis-
tinctly minority dean. (These days.

-by the way. I enjoy startling people

when they ask me for my support of
faculty unionization-V which by
rights I should do given most of my
other convictions by saying that I
don’t think the faculty are the solu-
tion but rather the problem. The
administration isn't the solution
either. The students are. Where are
they now that we need them?) I cer-
tainly had reason to think the faculty
would support me. After all. they
were the ones who had just recently
swept in all the reforms-— but. I
guess. without realizing that those
decisions had implied that they. in
their daily lives. were going to be the
glue in the system now that they had
branded the curriculum as an artifi-
cial and mechanical and ineffective
device. if

So. to repeat. it‘sjust as well that
we’re putting that old glue back in
because the faculty have decided
that they didn‘t mean all that. Or
hadnft you noticed the empty halls
and meeting rooms these past few

‘‘I would move that all CAS students be
required to take four years of writing, two
years ofa foreign language, one year of
col/ege-level math, a one-year survey of
Western European history, one year of West-
ern music, one year of Westernoart, one year

of Western literature,

one year of Western

phi/osophy——-and then they can all go ahead

and major in science.

I became dean in I973 after all the
freedom had been won. It was ‘pre-
sumably my job to implement that
freedom and I saw my biggest task to
be convincing the faculty of what an
awful responsibility they had taken
on themselves. In doing away with
the old curricular way of defining
what a liberal arts education was.
they had decided that they would do
thejob by a constant. insistent inter-
action with the student body in and.
out of class. That would mean a rad-
ical re-definition of their work. a
sacrificing to a considerable degree
of their “own" work in response to
the needs of the work of the univer-
sity community. My goodness. do I
suddenly feel very old saying all
those solemn things again. It seems
like a hundred years ago that most of
us were saying them.

It seemed to me that my major
object of attention should be the
rewards system for faculty. princi-.
pally tenure. since. of course. that
system is what defines for faculty
what their work should be. And sol
started opposing the dominant role
that so-called research played in the
system. not because I was anti-
research (whatever that could mean
any way) but because I knew that it
was through their research activities
that faculty identified not with the
local community and the undergrad-
uate student body, but 'wjtl.1 ,..the
national communities of their own '
disciplines and sub-disciplines. the
professions to which they saw‘fhem-
selves as really belonging. I was con-
vinccd that the only way to change

- that fundamental orientation was to

change the definition of their work.

* (I never. ofcoursc. intendcdthatthis ‘

be true for all. I believed. as they say

these da_vs.‘in “diversified staffing."). »
Well. did I ever get snowed under ‘ I

doors. doing his or her own work.
Every faculty organiration is dying
on the vine. We‘re told at every level
that a small coterie of committed
people are doing thejob for the rest
of us. We are free to do our own.
professional work. (Everyone is so
professional in my much-maligned
department these days that it makes
me want to cry. We used to be the
best amateurs in the business. the
best for—its-own-sakers. the.bcst lib-
eral artists.) Here we have in this
curriculum review one of the great
issues ofour community. and no one
except that small coterie is involved
or cares. l)o you think it‘s a coinci-
dence that virtually no one cares for

the community any more(except for

pay and privileges) and that wc’re
going back to a structured curricu-
lum‘.’ Let the catalogue tell students
what an education is all about.
Actually. the curriculum reform
doesn‘t go far enough. (Did that
mountain of revolt really produce
only this mouse?) Everything We
read in recent years about curricu-
Ium reform has openedgwith some

from Harvard. saying. “A degree
ought to mean that a student has
read Shakespeare. listened to

right in a way. (Distinguished pro-
fessors are always male.) —‘I really do
think that there should be either

quite well. not passably but quite‘
well. by the time they are graduated.
There are two ways of accomplish-
ing that: either the community
expects good writing constantly for
all four years. through all 40 courses
(with all the attendant reading on
the part of faculty community
work again) or the curriculum
requires a writing course for each of
the eight terms for every undergrad-
uate. Requiring one or two or three
courses ean’t possibly accomplish

that overwhelming task. It merely
serves as a token sign of faculty pre-
rogative. (AII together now: “We're
back in the saddle again.’‘)

By the way. I’m really interested in
seeing whether or not everyone no-
tices an improvement in student
writing as soon as the requirement is
imposed. Don’t laugh. It happened
the other way I2 years ago. When
the requirement was abolished. the
complaints about student writing
began immediately. I used to point

out that it would take several years
before students who didn‘t have the
requirement would be arriving in
upper level and graduate courses
and in the outside world. But to no
avail. The complaints began imme-
diately. I also used to point out to
faculty that more students took writ-
ing after it" was abolished as a
requirement than before (because
some had been excused previous-
ly) and that 90 percent ofour grad-
uates took some form of writing

without its being a requirement. and
75 percent took math. And. by the
way. nearly everyone took a litera-
ture course. I used to think those
were stunning facts but they never
caused the slightest ripple. I guess
the issue always really has been not
whether students did it but whether
faculty told them to do it.

So. ifl were at the FAS meeting-
which I won‘t because I have my
own work to do and. besides I don’t

Poor Jackie Sherrill. You really
have to pity him. His team is ranked
fourth in the country and is coming
off an impressive 42-28 win over
South Carolina. This was supposed
to be a rebuilding year!

To hear Sherrill, one gets the
undeniable impression that he is in
the midst of his worst season. Just
listen to him speak about tomor-
row‘s Pitt-West Virginia game at
Morgantown.

“I really don’t know if we can get
to (West Virginia quarterback)
Oliver Luck,“ Sherrill said. “They’ve
protected him awfully well this year.
Luck is the best quarterback we’ll
face all year."

Sherrill almost sounds as if he’s

conceding defeat. But you must’

excuse the Pitt coach if he sounds a
bit pessimistic—-he’s had a rough
week.

His ' quarterback. his franchise,

the one player he cannot, by his own
admission, afford to lose, will not
start tomorrow. Dan Marino’s ail-
ing right shoulder is still stiff, and
seldom-used Dan Daniels will get
the nod.

The prolific Pitt offense, which
has averaged 35 points a game, _will
be without its trigger. Of Pitt’s 14
touchdowns this year, l3 have come
from Marine aerials. Need more be
said?

lt’s time to face facts. With Dan
-Daniels leading the offense, Sherrill
has decided to change things. With
the return of Dwight Collins, Sher-
rill has been experimenting with a

Doubtful; Defen

three—back offense. The logic is
obvious. Not blessed with a cannon
like Marino. Daniels would have a
hard time getting the ball to the
explosive Collins.

But lining him up in the backfield.
where he can be the recipient of
flares and screens and yes. maybe

a few handoffs--Collins is given a.

better chance to utilize his sprinter
speed.

New wrinkles or- not, the defense
may have to win the ballgame for
the Panthers.

With the assumption that the Pitt
offense won‘t be nearly as effective
as in past games, the defense. sur-
prisingly solid this year. will be faced
with the unenviable task of holding
off the potent West Virginia attack.

How potent? '

Consider that the West Virginia
offense ranks right behind Pitt with
a 34.0 points—per—game average.
Consider that signal-caller Luck is
ranked l5th in the nation in total
offense. Sal Sunseri, Pitt’s only
senior on defense. knows the impli-
cations of playing Luck.

“Luck is a versatileiplayer,” Sun-
seri said. “He’s an aggressive player
with a good head on his shoulders.
He’s good at reading defenses. and
he’s tough when he's scrambling.”

Luck’s scrambling ability creates
havoc in enemy secondaries, be-
cause the pass coverage has to be
held that much longer. Rich Hollins
and the other West Virginia receiv-
ers can improvise the patterns and
react to Luck’s scramble. Hollins is
the Mountaineers‘ top pass-catcher

Kraynak Adjusts To
New Defensive Hole

By ROBERTA MILIE

Despite last year's graduation
losses which ravaged the Pitt
football team's defensive unit.
things seem to befitting in place
for this year's squad after only
three games. ‘

Junior linebacker Rick Kray-
nak is one reason that this year‘s
defense has emerged as an effec-
tive one. The soft-spoken 6-2.
2il6-pound Kraynak has made
his mark as a starter for Pitt in a
defense that was once in ques-
tion.

“We lost a lot ol great talent.
but our defense is working hard
together to make up for it."
Kraynak said. “There was a lot of
skepticism about how we’d do.
but so far we have come together
well."

Sobwell, in fact, that the Pan-
ther defense currently ranks No.

‘l in the nation. Kraynak‘s career

at Pitt has been following that
same “coming together” pattern.

When he first arrived at Pitt.
Kraynak said he expected to play
his freshmen year mainly on spe-
cialty teams‘ and was satisfied to
do so. He claims, however. that
even then he was already “look-
ing to the future”(when he would
start. By the time his sophomore
year rolled" around. Kraynak said
he was “hoping to get more play-
ing time"

During those two years spent
as an undcrstudy. Kraynak
learned a lot from the “teachcrs"
he had in front of him.

“I learned a lot from Hugh
Green. as a player and person.”

Kraynak recalled. “He was an
excellent teacher and always real
enthusiastic. He was always put-
ting out I00 percent.“

And so was Kraynak. He saw
‘defensive action last year in
seven games and was credited
with seven assists. five solo tack-
les and two quarterback sacks.

When spring drills started this
year. Kraynak was really ready
to prove himselfand try to secure
a starting position. Already a
two—year letterman at defensive
end, Kraynak was switched to
linebacker this year in order to
take advantage of his size and
quickness.

“I thought l had a good spring
ball." Kraynak said. “I got
adjusted and was confident in my
position.“

He stayed in Pittsburgh during
the spring session of classes and
worked out daily with the team‘s
weight training coordinator,
Buddy Morris. Kra_vnak’s well-
built frame confirms his extra
effort.

“I lifted and worked out every-
day." Kraynak said. “l even tried
to keep it up when l was home for
the rest of the summer."

According to Kraynak. it is
necessary even during the season
to lift “at least a couple oftimes a
week" to keep up his strength
and stay in shape.

In his first start ever against
Illinois and then two weeks later
against (‘incinnati. Kraynak got
his share of tackles. and the
defense proved itself to the
skeptics.

Doubles or singles‘. indoors or
outdoors. Pitt Lady Panther
Randi Belkin can do it all on the
tennis court and do it extremely
well.

Belkin lives up to her  l
seed on the team; she under-
stands every detail and angle of
the game. Perhaps more impor-
tantly. though.lshe knows what it
takes to win. ‘

’ Some players depend on blaz-
ing serves. and others rely on
powerful backhands. Belkin uses
an overall aggressive and steady
game.

Belkin. who has lost just three
times in l3 matches this season
explained that “aggressiveness is
the key" to her success this 
Now. instead of becoming appre-
hensive in a close match. Belkin
said she is compelled by her
aggressiveness.

Equally important to her game
is consistency.

"Consistency frustrates my

‘ opponents to no end." she said.

I

*match is as

For Belkin. a proper mental
attitude is also anecessity for
success in collegiate tennis
competition.

“Tennis is all in the mind,”she
maintained. A two-hour tennis
much mentally
exhausting as it is physically tir-
ing. Belkin stressed. ‘

According to Pitt teammate
Beth Baughman, “Randi has a
style all to her own.” She said
every part of Belkin’s game is
unique to her own" individual
style,iincluding her technique of
“self-psych.” P .

“In order to psycffmyself up I

do not think about the upcoming
match." said Belkin. This tech-
nique may not»-sound as exciting
as pounding one‘s head against a
gym locker. but it’s nonetheless
effective for Belkin.

l.ast ‘weekend Belkin and
teammate Cathy Jacobson
carved a niche for themselves
among the top-flight Eastern
doubles teams by capturing a
sixth place (out of (>4 teams) at
the Women‘s Eastern Collegiate
Tennis Tournament.

Pitt Coach George Dieffen
baeh called the team’s work “the
best showing in Pitt v-.'s.)men’s
tennis ever.”

Belkin says she enjoys playing
doubles because the responsibil-
ity and pressure is shared by two.

“We instill confidence in each
other during the match." Belkin
said. -

Another advantage in’ playing
doubles. she said, is the word of
encouragement from one‘s
partnef even after a bad hit.

Belkin has been around the
sport of tennis for over ll years.
Unlike the precocious young
superstars of today. however.
Belkin says that her game did not

.start to mature until the age of IS

or In.

Belkin » improved steadily“
throughout high school and went
on to an undefeated record her
senior year. Her outstanding
high school performance earned
her a scholarship to Pitt.

Now a senior at Pitt. Belkin
attributes part of her success to
her "own talent and determina-
tion. She credits to her coaching
the other part. According to Bel-
kin. her current coach. George

At first. Kraynak admitted.
getting used to a starting role is
quite an adjustment.

“l was nervous." Kraynak eon~
fessed. “We all were. with nine
new starters on defense. But
most of us have been playing
together for three years now and
we came together pretty good. I
think I got my job done."

That job. according to Kray-
nak. is to “make tackles. play the
pass. call out defenses; read
offenses and get to the ball.“ ln
essence. Kraynak directs the de-
fensive line along with senior Sal
Sunseri.

“Sal is a great leader." he said.
“With his experience. he really
helps out. He knows how to get
the team to an emotionally high
peak.”

_However_, according to Kray-
nak. the real test for himselfand
the defense is yet tocome. _

“South Carolina was our big-
gest test so far." Kraynak noted.
“The two weeks we had off really
helped us to prepare.”

Kraynak a Hit

He added that if the Panthers
stick together. play as they have
and stay away from injury. they
could have "an excellent team"
and “hopefully go into the Penn
State game undefeated." ln
Kraynal<’s opinion. they have to
“play tough from here on in.“

Looking ahead to tomorrow's
West Virginia game and next
wcek‘s Florida State contest.
Kraynak said that the matchups
should be “the real tests to Pitt's
defensive unit." T

Kraynak and his teammates
seem certain that the Panthers‘s
future will be bright.

“I am confident now and so is
the team." Kraynak said. “We
got the mental confidence we
needed from our first two wins."

Kraynak‘s optimism is not
limited to his experience with
football. It is also a reflection of
his feelings about his personal
life. in which he assumes a “first
things first“ attitude. An eco-
nomics major. Kraynak wants to
“get my degree and graduate”
before deciding on.a career.

WVU

cominucdfrom page ten
with 16 receptions and a sensational
20.2 yards a catch.

The problem for Sunseri and his
unit is clear-cut. Without Marina.
the defense will have to be at its best.

“We‘re going in there with the atti-
tude that if they don't s€ore. we can’t
lose.“ Sunseri said". ’

There was a time when such an
assignment would have been consid-
ered lu/dicrous. Before the season he-
gan. the consensus opinion was that
the offense would be Pitt’s strong

suit. The offensehas lived up to.

expectations. but the defense has
been no less impressive.

  

Sal Sunsert

“These guys (the new starters on
defense) had to wait for two years to
get their shot,” Sunseri said. “On
any other college team they are good
enough to start. but here it was

7impossible.”

They may.‘ eventually. make peo-
ple forget last year's crew. but the

/way they’ll do it will bedifferent.

according to Sunseri.

“These guys are crazy: they are
cut-throat maniacs. while last year‘s
crew had a lot ofcharacter.“Sunseri
said.

Sunseri and therest of the Pitt
team will have to muster all the char-
acter they can if they are to beat the
Mountaineers. With both teams
undefeated. the game is crucial.‘

For Pitt. it is an opportunity to
solidify its hold on fourth ‘place in
the polls and possibly to move up
in the wire—service rankings if Texas
loses to Oklahoma.

For West Virginia. it is a shot at

landing back into the Top 20 after-

being rudely dropped two weeks
ago. More importantly. a win could
improve the attractiveness of their
football program to potential blue~
chip recruits.

But they have to get by the Pi?!
defense first.

The Pitt l.ad_y Panther field
hockey team. off to a disappointing
2-4-l start. is looking to push its sea-
son record over the .500 mark this
weekend as it faces three teams in a
round-robin tournament on the Pitt
campus._

Pitt will host teams from the Uni-
versity of Maryland (Baltimore
County). lndiana University of
Pennsylvania (lUP) and Slippery
Rock State College in the tourna-
ment. which begins this evening and
continues through tomorrow after-
noon, ltfwill be the first time the
Lady Panthers have hosted a tour-
nament, and theteam hopes to make
it a regular attraction.

“Hopefully we can start some-
thing that will be implemented every
year." said Pitt field hockey coach.

ers. Karen Olsen. lracey Arnold
and Margie Hall scored goals forthe
l,ad_v Panthers in the first meetingas
the team bounced back and took
charge after a l—l halftime score.
Slippery Rock described by l)iGi-
acomo as “always aggressive and
very skilled in the fundamentals."
will be looking to avenge that loss.

Since the first Slippery Rock
game. the Pitt defense-has-gotten
stingier. but its offense has had

' problems putting the ball in the net.

Tonight‘s game. therefore. could be
a nail-biter.

Tomorrow morning. ‘Pitt will
again open the day‘s competition.
this time at Trees Field. against
Maryland.

Nobody seems to know too much
about the Maryland squad. but the

it was a game most people belie\e
Pitt should have won. Hall gave Pitt
a l—() halftime lead in the contest. but
Pitt's offense turned to ice in the
second half while Ill P found holes in
the usually impenetrable lxadyg
Panther defense.

Coach l)i(iiacomo has high-hopes‘
for the [Lady Panthers this weekend.

“I think we should beat everyone
in the tournament.“ said l)i(iia-

como. "We should have beaten ln-4,.‘

diana. but lithink our team was
overconfident when we played them
earlier.“

lhe tournament, schedule is as
follows:

It seems that almost every game

tournament at Pitt Stadium is no
exception.

The Pitt soccer team tried to come
back in the second half. but the com-
petition was too tough. as the Pan-
thers lost Wednesday‘s game to
Akron Llniversity by a score of 3-0.

The Panther defense shined. how-
ever. as it shut down Akron’s scoring
in the second half.

Nationally-ranked Akron came
out aggressively from the start. Pitt’s
defensive alignment. two forwards

“and an extra man in the midfield.

handled the Akron scorers for most
of the first half.

Then. l8 minutes into the first
half. Akron scored on the rebound
ofa shot that Pitt goalie Scott Thun-
berg couldn‘t handle.

Just three minutes later. Akron’s
J. B. Amanguoa, a 26-year-old Afri-
can. scored on a head shot that
sneaked past the outstretched hands
of Thunberg.

With the score 2-0 in Akron’s
favor, the Pitt defense came alive. lt
tamed Akron’s scorers and kept Pitt
in the game.

Then with just a little over four
minutes left in the first half. Pitt was
charged with a disputed foul in its
goal area. Akron‘s Jerry Spanos
booted the penalty kick past diving
Panther goalie if Thunberg. That
ended the scoring for the game,
because Pitt‘s defense stymied
Akron’s scoringabilityforthc rest of
the game.

“We played much better in the
second half.“ said Pitt Coach l..eo
Bemis. “We made too many errors in
the first 30 minutes. and Akron took
advantage of them."

The Panthers had only three shots
on goal. and each was turned back
by Akron goalie Dan Smith.

Smith‘s counterpart Thunberg.
however. was busy in the net. having
15 saves and constantly stopping
Akron’s firing shots. Thunberg’s
teammates supported him when he
was driven from the net. Especially
effective was Dan Zemanski.'who
turned back a few shots that were
sure Akron goals. —

Despite the loss. Bemis was
encouraged by the team’s
performance.

“Akroniis a good team," he said.
“Our defensive setup helped us to
keep the score down.‘ lf we had
played better in the first half. we
could have been in the game. We

Wwere always within reach of a

‘ victory."

The Pitt squad will have to reor-
ganize and recoup its loss when it
hosts Bucknell Universitytomorrow
at Pitt Stadium. Game time is l p.m.

Bucknell beat the Panthers last
year 5—() on Bucknell‘s home turf.
They return a lot of lettermen and
will field basically the same team
that defeated Pitt last year. i

Bucknell‘s record is 2-2-2 this
year. but according to Bemis. its

record is deceiving.

“Bucknell‘s is a strong defensive
team,” he said. “They’re struggling
this year because they’re having
problems scoring. but last year they
had a worse record and still came
out and beat us.“ A

Pitt‘s game plan will differ from
the defensive setup used against
Akron. -

“We won‘t play as much defense
against Bucknell.” said Bemis.

“We‘ll be moving and attacking
more. We‘rc both about equal in tal-
ent. The team that wants the win
most will get it. We’re going to have

to get more balance in our attack
and get more players scoring. We‘re
going to have to be on top of our
game in order to win.”

When the guys at Miller asked me to
write an ad on writing, I said, “Forget it.
Not even if you held a gun to my head’ So
they held a bottle of Lite Beer to my mouth.

They’re a pretty persuasive group.

TIIIIGS To MIIGS

if you're going to write anything, know
what you’re talking about. And that means
three things: Research, research, and
more research. The more you know, the
more you can tell your reader.

Take my characters. A lot of them I
base on actual people. There’s this buddy
of mine who pops up in every book l write.
in one story he’s a cop. In another, a pri-
vate eye. Once, l made him a millionaire.
Using him not only helped make character
development a heck of a lot easier, he was
so carried away by the rich image, he
bought me a lot of free dinners (and a lot of
Lite Beer from Miller). So use the people
you know as models.

s ballh ndling and scoring skills were sorely missed in Pitt’s 3-0 los
nationally ranked Akron.

Even locations should be based on
real things. If you’re writing about-a bar,
know that bar. Hang out there. Watch the
bartender. The customers. Whatever
they drink, you drink. When they drink
Lite Beer, you drink ‘Lite Beer. Re-
member—research is most fun when-
you soak up as much subject matter as
you can. It can only help you paint a

better picture.
III, DOLI.

No caper is complete without dames
(or ladies in proper English). Experience
has shown me that in mystery wr"ting, the
sexier the dames, the better. Experience
has also shown me that sexy scenes make
great punctuation marks. This is where
research has the greatest potential. Use
your own discretion in this matter. But
when you write about it, don’t be too
explicit. That way, your reader gets to paint
a more vivid picture. ‘

s to

CAPER 1'0 PAPER

O.K., you’ve got your characters, loca-
tions, and dames lined up. Now comes the
good part: Putting your caper to paper.
There’s no mystery to it. As long as you
write the ending first, the rest will follow.
Write short, terse, to-the-point sentences.
Be as clear as possible. And make sure
you’ve got the right stuff around for when
you get thirsty, After all, writing is pretty
thirsty work. i

I suggest a couple of mugs of Lite
Beer— who ever heard of a caper that
didn't involve a couple of mugs?

Why Lite Beer? It's a lot like me and my
books—great taste, less filling (some
people can’t get their fill of my books), and
always good to spend time with.

At any rate, follow my advice and, who
knows—you might turn out a heck of a
story. Or you might turn out to be a heck of
a Lite Beer drinker.

Kurtis: -

BY JANE HOLAHAN

You gotta be tough to make it in
Chicago, especially when you are an
ace reporter for the Chicago Sun
Times, who is clearing out the corrupt
politicians in City Couﬁncil. Punks
mug you in dark alleys, thugs try to
kill you at every corner under
instructions from corrupt politicians
and your apartment even gets blown
up. .
Now you figure a guy tough
enough to live through all that could
hold his own with some flakey
woman who lives in a log cabin in the
Rockies and takes photographs of
eagles, right? Well anybody who has
ever been to the movies knows that
the guy is going to fall apart as soon
as he smokes his last cigarette and
"realizes he's not in Chicago anymore.

John Belushigplays the tough guy,
Ernie Souchak, and Blair Brown, as
Nell Porter is more than his match in
oneof the most delightful films of the
year so far, Continental Divide. Director
Michael Apted and screen writer
Lawrence Kasdan (who also wrote
Body Heat) make it look easy. Sure

romantic comedies like this are as old

asthe hills, and thecharacters are old
stereotypes (Katherine Hepburn and
Spencer Tracey come to mind) but it
works.

Kasdan remains true to his charac-
ters, and Apted paces the film beauti-
fully, but the real secret to Continental
Divide.'s success is that it is a modern

  MMI

By LESLIE VAN BUSKIRK
In the best scene of Mammie Dearest,
Joan Crawford (Faye Dunaway)
screams to her daughter Christina,
"Get me the ax!" Sound like a horror
movie? In a way, it is. Not like your
typical B/C schlock like Friday The
13th, which leave you nothing to

   
   

    

I think about later, save for temporar-

ily convincing you that everyone is a
potential hatchet murderer. Like
movies that fall into the cheapo hor-
ror genre, though, l\/lommie Dearest
makes you giggle uncomfortably at
momemts, but not because yet
another murder is about to occur
amidst dark surroundings; the ner-
vous laughter is a cover-up to the
true horror and revulsion at the sight
of both verbal and physical abuse of a
innocent child. There are no"boogey
men" no mythological werewolves,
just a very real ”monster" of sorts~—
Joan Crawford.

The question of the authenticity of
/Vlnnmzir Dearest arises, but it is one
that really can't be answered. We
must assume that it’s a true story;
why else would a middle-aged
woman write about her tormented
life with her paranoid Hollywood
actress-mother? Revenge? Money?
Recognition? Perhaps, but there is an
undeniable ring of honesty that peals
throughout the movie. The incidents
seem too well defined, too clear cut to
be inaccurate.

The picture starts with the wish
and arrival of an adopted baby, Chris-

tina, an infant Joan Crawford coo’s .

and smothers (for the benefit of the
gathered press, no doubt). The next

story as much as it is a traditional
story. Nell Porter is a strong woman,
a liberated woman, yet she isn't used
as a foil for Souchak. Sure he can't
climb mountains like she can, in fact
he looks rather foolish up in the
Rocky Mountains, pining over his
lost cigarettes, but nobody makes any
‘judgements. Kasdan repects both
characters in different ways.
Souchak has to get out of Chicago
because things are getting too hot, so
his editor assigns him to cover Nell
Porter, who likes reporters about as
much as Dutch Elm disease. Watch-
ing John Belushi climb the Rocky
Mountains to get to her log cabin is
worth the ‘price of admission itself.
Belushi is somewhat restrained in the
role, but he manages very well. His
reactions to the wilderness are quite
memorable.
Blair Brown has a marvelous char-
acter to work with, and she takes full
advantage ‘of it, without becoming

priggish. Perhaps this is partly due to:

the films obvious love of the rough

i

and tough Chicago that Souchak has ‘

left behind as well as its’ obvious
acceptance of a strong, independant
woman who can do quite well with-
out all that.

'They fall in love (you know they
will at their first meeting, which has
them hating each other of course)
and have to work out their huge
problems, which they do delightfully.
It is refreshing to see a film so sure of
itself and its characters

scene cuts to t e chi 's irth ay
party (she looks to be about six years
old now), a lavish affair held in Craw-
ford's backyard with caterers, ponies,
a merry-go-round, and, of course, the
press. Joan poses adoringly with her
daughter in matching dresses, look-
ing like the personification of the per-
fect child/parent relationship. _It is
later revealed that the child is only
allowed to keep a single birthday
present, the rest to be given away to
”the poor, homeless orphans," (Joan's
idea). It's about now that the horror
begins. ’Scene’s attesting to Joan's
sadistic side are reveled one after
another. The three that stick out the
most can be dubbed The Raw Meat
Scene, The Wire Hanger Scene, and
The Midnight Hatchet Machine, but
to reveal what happens in each of
these would spoil it for potential
movie-goers. Let it suffice to say that
they're not very pleasant.

The question as to whether or not
Mummiii Dmmt is a good movie is diffi-
cult to answer. On the plus side are
grand performances by Faye Duna—
way, Mara Hobel (as the younger
Christina), and Diana Scarwid (as the
older Christina); on the minus side is
the film's tendency to cut itself short
with choppy scene transition. But,
one thing's for sure, /\/lommir Dmrrst
keeps its audience interested for its
duration—-there is never a dull
moment.

Only hen I La u

Only When I Lriuglz is Neil Simon's
latest entry in a longstringiof suc-
cessful films and plays. Adapted from
his play Gingerbread Lady, it is a charm-
ing, poignant story of an actress’ bat-
tle with alcoholism and the growing
relationship with her 17 year old
daughter.

Marsha Mason plays Georgia, an
actress who is returning home after
d ‘n out in an alcoholic rehabilita-

  

    
    

tion center. She is trying to start her
life anew, and begins by getting to
know her daughter Polly, played by
Kristy McNichol. Mason is in her
usual top form, playing Georgia with
a kind of comic sadness. This is not a
typical character for her to play, as
she usually portrays very strong
women (Tlzr Cnml—lr_i/r Girl, Cliaptvr
Two). But Georgia is weak; as long as
everything is going great she is fine,
but then things start to godownhill.

 

 

Her best.frien Jimmy, a mi e-aged
gay actor, is fired from an acting joti,
Toby's (her other best friend) hus-
band leaves her, and Georgia takes
the part of herself in ‘her old lover's

if play. She then beginsdrinking. Even

though she has spent several weeks
drying out, she still cannot handle,

problems, When’ she cannot get hol.)

ofa therapist, it is the last straw. She
breaks down and goes off the wagon. _
The only person strong enough to
help Georgia is her daughter Polly.
Kristy McNichol‘ does a surpris-
ingly good iob in this role. Although
only 17, she is spunky and wise to the
world, thanks to realizing how weak
her mother is. She has lived with her
father for several years, and thus is
actually a stranger to her mother. It is
Polly's idea to move back with Geor-
gia and finally get to know her. Geor-
gia is reluctant to go along with her,
but it's a good thing that she does,

 
 

because Polly pulls her through Fm“ I

rough times and gives her strength
enough to eventually meet with Pol-
ly’s father, bruises and all (she is
attacked coming out of a bar). This
part could win Ms. Mason yet
another Academy Award nomina-
tion. .

James Coco is perfect for Jimmy,
the gay actor who is Georgia's best
friend. He is very funny and endear-
ing, and although he cares verymuch
for Georgia, even he can't stop her
drinking. in fact, he doesn't even
notice that she is hitting the bottle,
because he is drowning his own so"-
rows after losing a long-awaited pa‘.
on stage. This is the type of character
that James Coco plays so well; very
funny, but slightly sad or pathetic. He
is one of the industry's most talented
comic actors, and pulled this role off
with his usual finesse.

Sid Jordan did a more than ade-
quate directing iob. Of course, Neil
Simon doesn't write directors’ pic-
tures, he writes actors' pictures. The
film moved smoothly and easily, and
in no part did it get boring or slow. A
film like this is better without fancv
camera tricks, and Jordan managed .
stay clear ofthese. He directed it with
just the right mixture of pathos and
humor to make Only Wlmi I Lauglz an
endearing film, and one of Neil Sim-
on's finest. «

"This is Michael Stanley," the

the phone-speaker... It was a laid-

~ back almost callousecl voice--a

voice.of a man who had been
forced upon a lot of bad breaks,

’ s but who survived with a style of
‘ rock-and-roll that is sweeping
the charts at this very moment.)

I should know.

I grew -up with the Michael 

Stanley Band's music for five of
the thirteenyears that Michael
Stanley has been playing rock-
n—roll. Like everyone else in the
C.leveland.—Youngstown area, I
cut my teeth on ’’You‘ Break It
You Bought It," "Ladies Cho-
ice," ”Stage Pass/‘and ”Cabin
Fever." By then Michael Stanley
had become Cleveland's own
rock hero~——sort of Northeast-
ern’s own Bruce Springsteen——
but there was a problem. No one

 

   
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  

else in the country had heard of
the MichaelgSt-anley Band.
The root of the evil lay in the

fact that MSB was getting no ~ 

airplay besides AWMMS in
Cleveland, and WSRD in

‘ Youngstown. This is something

that still bothers Stanley: ”It's
basically a thing where so many
stations around the country are
so heavily formatted that it
leaves little chance for new
groups; the guidelines are very
set and it's hard to break into
that mold unless your (just
happen to be a band that falls
into that styleiwhich is desired
right now, which, for AM radio
especially, has nothing to do
with rock and roll."

Two record companies and
yet even another album (Greatest
Hints) later, the light still had not
shone on MSB, "-It would have
been easy to call it quits," admits

Love You" both of which
included cameo appearances by
Clarence Clemmons. Rock ius-
tice at last-’ . *

By the time MSB had
returned’ from their Heartland
tour, EMI America was scream-
ing, for more. Within 25 days,
Stanley and his crew had writ-
ten and practiced the songs for
the new album. Two and a half
months later Norlhcoast was
slapped on the rear and has been
riding in the top 20 since. ”With
Northroast we've refined what we
do and what we want to do,"
said Stanley.

Concerning the older MSB

material Stanley feels that,
"Songwise I still like a great deal
of it, but from what we did with ’
it——well, there are a number of
songs I'd love to re-record T
because ‘I don't think we did
then total justice. But that'sjus,t
a growing process." "

Personnel-wise, MSB ‘has '

gone through a great change.
The original band was a give-
piece outfit that consisted‘ of
Michael Stanley, guitars and
vocals; Bob Pelanders, key-
boards; Tommy Dobeck, drums;-
Dan Pecchio (remember him .-
from Class Harp?), bass; and‘
Ionah‘Koslen (who later formed
Breathless)_, lead guitar and
vocals. Eventually,:Koslen and
Pecchio left and Gary Markasky
(guitars), Michael Gismondi
(bass), Kevin Raleigh (key-_ '
boards), and Rick Bell (saxo-
phone) enlisted to form the
present MSB septet. .  A 

Has success changed Michael '
Stanley? "We're not selling our-
selves as personalities.~—we ‘
want people to take us for what
we do in the live situation and
what we put down on record,”
he said, ”Other than that we're
happy to just go about our
business." , \

/Stanley also does not agree
tht his is just another Top 40’ ‘
band, "We're writing songs tht
we like first of all, and I don't
think we're doing anything rad-
ically different than we've ever
done...lt's still us doing what we
want to do...If you try to please
everybody you're gonna lose
your mind, and you're not going
to succeed anyway. So we go in
there and make an album that
we're proud of, and hopefully
other people will dig it."

On Monday, Oct. 12 the ,
Michael Stanley Band will get
their chance to win over Pitts-
burgh at the Stanley Theatre ‘
and, personally, I'm sure they
will. After all, Cleveland rock-n-
rollers don't lie.

A Grand Debut For A
Pittsburgh Rocker

EAT’N ALIVE!

Norm Nardini 8: The Tigers
Sutra Records

You have something very
special to get away with doing
what Norm Nardini does. Not
that what he does is, in any way,
bad; on the contrary, "what
Norm and The Tigers manage
to do is quite good. And what
could that be? Somehow
they've managed to scrape away
at all the rot that's been
gathered around rock and roll in
the past several years, and get
straight to its core. The way
they sing and play isn't madly
innovative or very polished, but
that's why it works—its rock
and roll without the "fancy frills.
Their music's success’ lies in its
deceptive simplicity.

Eat'n /llive is their first album
and, oddly enough, it was
recorded live—-—and in Cleveland
too! Although alive debut disk
might seem strange, it works to

PLEASANT DREAMS
The Ramones
Sire’

It's reassuring to know that
some things never change. Take
the Ramones, for instance.

They've been putting out fast—

paced, simple-chorded rock for‘

the pastfew years without a
hitch-——except that they never’
get boring. Pleasant Dreams con—.
tinues the tradition. '
Repitition usually doesn't
work, but Ramones don't care;

the lyrics to "Don't Go" prove it:

"Don't go don't go, hahy il0n't
go/Don’! go don't go,’ baby a'em't
go/Don't go a'on't go/Don't leave me
this way /Hey hey hey..." It doesn't
matter, though, ”Don't Go" is
one of the best songs on the
album anyway. ~ .
Ramones’ songs are often
throw—backs to the fifties music
era. The lyrics- to ”7-11,” for
instance, remind me of ”Teen
Angel": "I lcisseal and hugged
here/lrfd l said go0il—l2ye/last thingl
knew/She .woaliln't make it out

.ali15e/On—r0ming car went out of (on-

trol/lt crashed my hahy//ind it

crzrsheii my soul..." Hey, this could

become an 80's classic!
Anyway, Ramones songs are

an advantage here. Being ableto
hear the obvious rapport
between Nardini and his

"audience definitely helps give

‘\

him a personality to tune into;
one of the drawbacks of hearing
a studio debut by a new band is
that they remain somewhat
anonymous. s

Standouts here include "Rock
And Roll Man," ”Big Girl Now,"
”Nothing To Lose," all written
by Nardini, and "Burning Up,"
co—written by The Silencers’
Warren King. A few songs——
"Love Dog" and "Undercover
Lover"——are almost too corny,
but Nardini manages to pull
themoff with unabashedrockl
and roll marhismo.

This album is a pleasant sur-
prise, and not because theband
is from Pittsburgh, but because
I probably would have enjoyed it
ju.st as much if they had come
from Cleveland.

L.V.B,

short, so this review should be
the same. Last word: buy this-~
you'll be glad that you did.

BEIIA DONNA

Stevie Nicks

Modern

"Well, I never thought l'il make it
here in Hallywaml. I never thought I'd
ever want taslay. But what I seem to
taarh these days just turns to gold.
What lseem to want, well you know, I
find a way."

——"/lfter the Glitter Fades"

True, itseems that Stevie
Nicks. has attained the magical
Midas Touch of rick and roll.

Her first solo album, Bella Donna,

has already gone platinum, with
sales exceeding 1.3 million, and
her duet with Tom Petty,“"Stop

.Dragging My Heart. Around,”

has become a top_ five single,
proving that this Fleetwood
Mac vocalist can stand on her
own two feet.‘

' Despite her success, though,
Bella Donna indicates that Nicks

is having some stability prob-
lems. The album could easily be
an extended play of Fleetwood
Mac's "Landslide," in which she
conveyed confusion about the
changes of life.

The theme of change surfaces
repeatedly, once in the album's
best song, "Edge of Seventeen,':

"The sea changes rol0rs/ But the sea
does not change."

’’Edge of Seventeen", filled
with (00's and raw's and incessant
guitar” grating, produces the
same ominous effect as John
Stewart's ”Midnight Wind,"
which Stevie co-wrote and sang
back—up for, and "Sister of the
Moon," from Fleetwood Mac's
Task album.

A little mellow, yes; fragile?
No. Never fragile. Don't let her
fairy princess exterior fool you;
Nicks is a tough cookie, and

Bplla Donna proves that she can
hold her own.

DARK CONTINENT
Wall of Voodoo

I.R.S. . ,
After hearing this album, one

wonders if Wall of Voodoo, hav-
ing a strange handle on humor

“anyway, decided to purposely
bore the listeners of Dark Conti-
nent. And, believe me, there's no

denying that this LP is boring. A

Vocalist Stanard Ridgway
suffers from a common illness
that plagues so many of today's
young bands: talking too much
instead of actually singing.

Occasionally, the talking works

to a song's benefit——but not for

the entire album!

Along the same train of
thought, the songs themselves
are monotonous; often it's

impossible to tell one from

another. With a stretching of
the imagination, however, ”Me
And My Dad" and "Tse Tse Fly"
can be thought of as somewhat
interesting.

Many of Wall of Voodoo’s
lyric are -supposed to be satiri-
cally humorous, yet they are
presented in a fashion so pos-
tured that it's impossible to
enjoy them in that way. Overall,
assuming that Dark Cmatinent is
characteristic of Wall of Voo-
doo, their impersonal, repeti-
tious style is just too much to
take for an entire album.
