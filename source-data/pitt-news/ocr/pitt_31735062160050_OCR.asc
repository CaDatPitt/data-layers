Purdy.Denies Political

  Clubs Affect State Aid

Dan Purdy, ardent advocate of student political clubs
on campus, ‘answering..a pessimistic. statement by Dean of
Men T. W. Biddle, claims that partisan groups on campus
would have little effect on state policy toward the school.

Purdy, sophomore member, of¢
Mén’s Council, proposed a resolu-
tion last week requesting that the
University sanction the organiza-
tion of national political clubs.

Dean Biddle said last week that
the resolution, which passed the‘
council unanimously, had little
chance of being approved by the

oath. That was a political is-
sue.” a

“State employees,” he added,
“have ~ political. clubs, and they
get their wages from the state.
By recognizing political organiza-
tions, the University is more fully
ﬁlling its obligations as an edu-
cational institution.”

The long-standing Student Or-
ganizations Committee has, to date,
refused to recognize any political
groups on campus. The Young
Democrats, ‘the Young Republi-
cans, and the Young Progressives
have been vetoed in the past.

    Retail Training Student
  Was. a Trappist Monk

   

 

By IRENE ROZAKIS

From a life of golden silence tonthe tinny clatter of the
Christmas rush of a toy department in a downtown store is
the strange pattern the life of graduate student George

\

Cossette has followed since he left the French University

of Montreal. _
Prior to,his enrollment at Pitt’s

_ Research Bureau for Retail Train-

ing, the French-Canadian spent
nine long months as a novice in a
Trappist monastery.

Long, because one of the rules
of the Trappist sect is ‘f$il_-ence!”

After reciving his B.A. degree
from the University of Montreal,
‘where he concentrated on com-
merce, Cossette decided to for-
sake the pleasures and sins of the
material world and enter the
Catholic monastery. ,

No Quick Decision

‘‘It was not a hasty decision,” he
hastens to point out. “It took three
lmonths of serious thought to de-
cide.”

He soon found it was rough_,

going, however. Trappist novices

rise at 2 am. daily, go to bed

at 7 p.m. in the winter, and at

8 p.m. in the summer.

No fried eggs for breakfast at 2
.a.rn., either, because the monks
don’t eat breakfast until 7 a.m.
when they are ﬁnished with their
ﬁve-hour prayer period.

In fact, no fried eggs any time
because e.ggS,imeat, and ﬁsh are
foods forbidden to the monks.

—. Not Recommended

Although 'headmi_ts it was an
enlightening experience, Cossette
doesn’t recommend it as an exper-
iment for other young men.

.

“‘I have seen -some men who
just came to see 'what it was
like,” he said. “They did not

; stayamore than two weeks.”

After nine months of this the
French-Canadi'an decided it was

not the life for him. Before coming
to Pitt he worked as a traveling
salesman for a printing company,
and also spent some time in ~ the
United Naval Training Division,
which is the counterpart of this
country’s ROTC. -
‘Weemen’ Lovely

Coming from a family of ﬁve
brothers and seven sisters, Cos-
sette doesn’t ﬁnd it very hard to
talk to people. In fact, in the
housewares department, his pres-
ent job, he has discovered that his
French accent helps rather than
hindershim. He says, “Oh, the
weemen theenk when they talk to
me, ‘This is a Frenchman. He is
different.’ ” ’

The differences between Pitt
and University of Montreal are
not great. The French University,
however ,puts more emphasis on
philosophy and ‘general education
and less on specialization. Tests
are always essay-type and of a
more personal nature. -

He has had time to observe stu-
dents a bit, too. His comment on
Pitt women was to the point. “The

weemen?” he said. “Lovely!”

it, by suppressing the press. , .

dom ‘grew out of two articles which were
allegedly pro-communist in content but not
demonstrably pro-communist in intent.

One was a letter which if it indicates any-
thing shows a disposition to hear both sides
of the current" dispute between communism
and capitalism. The other was an interview,
justiﬁable on the groundspthat it was of in-
terest to the readers.

The action was taken despite the knowl-
edge that none of the staff was even remotely
tinged with the communist philosophy; there
weren’t even charges that the sheet was pink. I
Obviously the Board ofiRegents at California
was pressured into the move by misguided

. patriots.

But the paper lost something which it had
prided itself in for almost half a century and

, lost it without a struggle. No newspapers

took up the ﬁght in its defense. Editor & Pub-
lisher the trade magazine of the journalistic
world, merely. carried a story.

The freedom of the college press, while

\more complexthan that of the commercial

and more indeﬁnite, is every bit as vital to

, a free society. The student press should, and
’ where it is responsible‘ it does, perform the

same functions as it is professional counter-
‘part. U

If instruction, in the responsibility of free-
dom begins ,in"the university, its practice
should also begin there. The degree to which
this is attained may be determined by the

“ health and vigor of its student newspaper.
I Clearly the University of California—-where "
f the loyalty oath was~~born—is in ill health.

/vied Progress

Progress at Pitt usually leaves the student-

I in-the-hall cold. Too often the progress is in

areas which do not concern him or will take
place long afterhe has left the Cathedral.
And there is rarely any attempt to show him
just what an increase in the stature of the
School of Public Health has to do with his
degree in liberal arts or engineering. ,
The announcement that work on the ex-
pansion of the Medical School’s facilities will
soon begin should, however, strike a more
understanding chord. The . expansion. will
enable an increase of 50 per cent in the en-
rollment of med school, welcome news to
hundreds of Pitt graduates who each year go
to different parts of the world to get their
M.D.’s, or give up altogether.
Almost every qualiﬁed student in the Uni-
versity who has hoped to get in the medical
school should feel a little more optimistic
about his chances. ,The rest of the student
body should share in the University’s pride
on the impending realization of a dream
come true.
A .Every step Pitt advances in any ﬁeld en-
hances, the value of our degrees. This is a
practical reason for a little enthusiasm.

Leadership Sans.Key.

JACK MARKOWITZ . ‘

It is without joy and, let mefadmit it, with some

nostalgia that I record the passing of, not only a M

group of individuals, but a way of life. . ,

I am speaking of the now-extinct Keychasers, a
species of men devoted to glittering leadership on
the campus. I I _

Members of the group were recognizable by the
wearing of keychains, usually <
golden and in length 14 inches,-

half-dozen “keys,” tokens --of
membership in some more or less
reputable student organization.
At his prime, the keychaser
was a joy to two senses-—he jin-
gled and glittered. A passerby
would not ‘soon forget the dazz-
ling sight of him, if the light

 

on his keychain rebounded joyously about the walls

and danced into the soul of his viewer. Truly, the

keychaser had an impressive candle power. -

A Memorable Sight ‘ ' A
And if one were privileged to hear and see him

in motion, his half-dozen treasures catching the

H gleam of the morning’s ﬁrst beam, one never forgot.

W

But something” happened--who shallsay what?
—-a lingering suspicion deep with the chaser that
an overladen» chain denoted the sin of pride,
a vague distrust that a display of golden keys did
not constitute 24-carat sincerity. , ,

Perhaps merely the excessive weight“ on one side.
of thebody was throwing the keychaser’s physiol-

ogy -askew. For whatever reason, let us record the  T

simple fact that the keychaser is no more.-

Is There Hope?

Yet there are stirrings of life. The local chapter
of Omicron Delta Kappa encourages the prominent
display of its key on the bosoms of its members.

New ODK tappees, who, before ordination, had
rarely worn neckties, now purchase‘ tie pins—the
kind with a little chain attached-—to hold the key
before the eyes of the masses. The sale of tie pins
naturally encburaged the sale of accessory neckties,
shirts, and suits——literal1y, prosperity in ever-
widening circles. I ‘ . »

one organization stands its ground in unashamedly
wearing its key. And though the laundry bills for
white shirts are inﬂationary, the ODK’s are grimly”
holding the line. I salute _them.

in the light of the . . . order which states that all
articles which were ‘controversial, questionable, or

Panthers, Like WVU,
Canit Beat ’Em Either

By BORIS WEINSTEIN

Doc Car1son’s cagers can expect no better treatment from
.Penn State tomorrow night in their last game than West
Virginia got Wednesday night at State College. The Staters

oasting a two-game winning

streak-—a drop in the basket to the15—game streak the Lions

straight-—-make their third ap-

pearance against the Nittanies at State.

Gross’ lads soundily defeated

the Pitts. Both games were played at the Field House.

Zone Stops.Workman

There were whispers earlier, “an upset, maybe” by
Carlson and Pitt hoop followers prior to the State—Moun-
taineer‘ conclave, but even the good Doctor, who made a
special visit to State College Wednesday to scout the L10l’1S,
would admit now that his chances are mighty slim.

State’s win Wednesday night was its 18th in 22 starts

rginia. It also ended a losing
streak on the road to Penn, Col-
gate, and Syracuse——the last two
in overtime.

Gross’ strict zone defense——the
same hoodoo that Pitt must face—
rationed the great Mark Work-
man to a‘ mere three points, while
State’s great freshman star, Jesse
Arnelle, bagged 20 points.

Palatella Secret Weapon

But Carlson, always one for sur-
prises‘, may have something up
his stethoscope, yet. Lou Patatella,
6-1, 230—pound football guard,
with no high school hoop experi-
ence, has been working out with
‘a basketball for two weeks and
will make the trip tomorrow.

His job, if Carlson goes through
‘with pre-game plans, will be to
keep’ Arnelle close company un-
der the basket. And if both Jay
McMahan and Arnelle are‘ in the
lineup Forward Dick Deitrick, an-
other Pitt football player, will join
the little affair.

Ball control against the zone
will be the strategy of the game,
and like the other Pitt-State hoop

kept down.

ARDS from

the Sports hufle

  
  

By DON MURDOCK

Sports Editor

Doc Carlson may be a medical doctor of good standing,
but he’s not worth a plug nickel as a diagnostician.
He may be able to analyze diseases but I wonder if
he can explain the strange behavior of this year’s basket-

ball team.

After 30 years of coaching at Pitt Carlson has ﬁnally
met his match—this year’s Pitt hoop edition——which could

cost Carlson his job—not as hoop
mentor, but as a medical doctor.
Sure To Win Tomorrow
After all, if '
Carlson c a n ’ t
cur e his own
b a s k e t b a 1 1
team, how can
he possibly cure
a student with
mental fatigue?
, His hoopsters
have the das-
tardly disease of
pititis -— t- h e y
pity the under-
dog and show
no mercy for the favorite.

Andiafter 21 games Doc has ,

found no remedy to the some-
times pleasant, sometimes un-
pleasant situation at Pitt.

In fact Carlson feels that his
boys haven’t recovered from the
ﬂlness and will pull a ‘Villanova’

. tomorrow night.

Not One But Eleven

'My analysis on the cronic dis- .

ease, which was inherited from
the ﬁnal game of last year-the
West Virginia upset, is based on
eleven of the 21 contests this year,
as follows:

In the games with Columbia,

 

Princeton, Syracuse, Westminster,
and the two games with Notre
Dame, Carlson’s boys were ranked
as the underdogs. Doc’s diagnosis
might have been wrong, but what-
ever medicine he prescribed for
his team ‘was certainly good
enough to help them to upsets in
those six games.

On ﬁve other occasions, when
Pitt was conceded victories over
Penn State, Yale, Penn, Tech, and
Georgetown, the strange malady
returned to reverse the ﬁnal de-
cisions and score Pitt as upset vic-
tims. '
Hoyas Win, Irish Fail!

Right away you many think that
is entirely wrong. Why Penn State
with a 17-4 chart is much better
than lowly Pitt. But in December
when the two teams ﬁrst met, the
Panthers were expected to win, if
only because of the home ﬂoor.

The Panther’s mediocre rec-
ord shows a strange assortment
of ups" and downs. For instance,
the amazing victory over Syra-
cuse, 72-49, and then just one
week later, a. pitiful perform-1
ance against Tech in a losing
effort, 65-56.

BY JACK DAVEY

The Faculty Diehards ran
out of liniment and just plain
died at the Stadium Wednes-
day, as the Mixers defeated them
in the ﬁrst game of a three-game
playoff in the Professional
League, 46-29. It was the first
time the Faculty had beenbeaten
in league competition.

The ﬁrst half was played on one
of the three small Stadium courts
and found the faculty only two
points behind as the second per-
iod ended. L’

In the second half they switched
to the large court ‘and Tim Bahy-
nam and Fred Knauss combined in
a fast break for» the Mixers’ that
sunk the Diehards’ chances for a
victory. Their ball handling and
shooting accounted for a total of
26 points with Bahynam pulling
down high scoring honors with
15. Big John Marlow kept the
Diehards cause alive by contribut-
ing twelve points.

the ﬁnal quarter the Diehards
threw an all—court press on the
Mixers but failed to stop Bahy-
nam and Knauss from breaking
away to score. Twenty points in
the last eight minutes was too
much for the Diehards to match

a Saturday, and two days later
the Panthers upset Notre Dame.

It’s nice to win those “impossi—
bles”, but they make the loses
to the “patsies” doubly hard to
take. And apparently, Carlson has
decided that the best tonic is for
time to take its course. For he
hasn’t cured the basketball. plague
this year. -

it a tie for ﬁrst place in the Fra-

After trailing through most of
three periods, the determined
Delts outscored the PiKA’s 20-15
in a crackling ﬁnal stanza.

With a record of 14-2, DTD is

And the willows sway gently.

tween the present Pitt News and

or magazine that carried all the
news at WUP. But most of all, it
reflected the life at the hilltop
school. _
Panther—type Poetry

In those days the independents
had just as much fun lambasting
the frat men and all “initiators” as
they do today. In a 1906 issue of
the Courant was this poem:

They threw him in a river,
I They hung him on a tree,
They threwehim in a fire that
was blazing‘.
And the fellow up and died
And the merry-makers cried;
Why, how funny! And we
were only hazing.

By LEO MOSS

Can you recall when Pitt beat Allegheny College in
football, 74-0? It really happened, but the score Wasn’t the
most amazing thing. The Pitt newspaper made an under-
statement of calling the game score “encouraging.”

That was 1906. There was no Cathedral of Learning,

Pitt was still called the Western¢-

The Courant was a cross be—-

The Pitt poets of the early cen- 5

were girls even in ’O6.
“Arms and the man.” the R0-
mans sang,
“To battle, and bleed, and
die.”
But “Arms and the man,” on
a different plan,
Is the modern maidens cry.
Forty—six years ‘haven’t chang-

coed of ’06 was heard saying, “Oh,
Prudence, hasn’t he the perfectly
sweet sideburns.”

Coeds New

Coeducation in those days was
just an experiment and looked on
with distrust from some quarters.
But the editors of the Courant de-
fended coeducation, writing that it
had “been a success . . . due to the
excellent moral, intellectual. and

Another suggestion came from
the Courant to increase school
spirit that makes it hard to be-
lieve that it was written 45 years

ago.
But careful not to be too liberal,
the article continued, “But it

doesn’t seem that a cigarette com-
pletes the costume. They are too
weak for men and too strong for
women.”

Even college students at the be-
ginning of the century had fun
deridi-ng the horseless carriage.
This poem appeared in 1906:
