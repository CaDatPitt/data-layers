A ‘THE’ PITT WEEKLY.

‘ I-‘IOONOR SYSTEM A GREAT

‘SUCCESS IN OTHER
I UNIVERSITIES
‘During ‘Christmas vacation. the
niembers of the Board of Control
made inquiries into the honor sys-

‘ tems of _other universities.

V It ‘has been found that a great
many universities in the United
States have the honbr system in suc-
cessful operation. There are many

arguments in favor of this system.‘

The most pleasing feature of the sys-
tem, itiis claimed, is that the faculty

1 gives more power to the student as

Along as he can_ conduct himself as a
The honor-syste is not
only an inspiration for a student to

‘do his/own individual work, but also

, is a way in which he learns to be

honest with everyone. When a man
gets out into the‘ world he is not
judged by what he has done in col-
lege, but by what he can do himself,
and if he has worked hard’ and in-
dividual.ly in college he can do the
same anywhere. A number of dis-
tinguished professors of Princeton,
‘Harvard and Yale have accredited
the honor; system to many a student’s
success after graduation. ‘They say
that it is a motto which he has and

.puts into practice for the four years

in which he is in college and mould-
ing his,career, and when he gradu-
ates he is bound’ to put into practice
the‘sam% models which have guided

‘ him in. college.

The constitutionsiof t'he honor sys-
tem of examinations have been pro-
cured from the University of Penn-
sylvania, Cornell, Penn State, W.- »&
_T., Chicago, Georgetown, Wisconsin,
Wooster and a number of other col-
leges of reputation. All of these in-
stitutions claim ‘that the success of
the honor system had surpassed all
expectations. When the honor sys-
tem is installed by the students it
tneansithat unless an examination
student’s
signature or honor the paper will not
be accepted by the professor.

A vote will be taken sometime in
February by the‘ students in order to
secure a test of sentiment on the

'‘-question of adopting the honor sys-
‘ tem. » .. T

’- ’ <'3oo'D~T1M_E To WORK
'iDuringvthe term upon which we
have just entered every student ought
tO7'ge't do.wn to real hard-work and
make every minute count. In the
Fall and Spring, terms there are so
many things that take the students
attention that too often the regular
school activities and studies are
neglected’, 'Butein t'he Winter term
there is no reason why every person
should not do their best work.

- This is the time when the Cap and
Gown Club,tthe debating teams and
the Glee.Club get in their work. Any
man that liasabiility along such lines
should‘ take as large a part in these
activities as'is consistent with num-
ber of hours he has on his schedule.
No manisltould go through his Uni-
versity course without taking part, as
much as possible, in student activities.‘

A call has been -issued for men _to
Corrie out for ‘the debating teams.
Some of the best colleges and uni-
verSi_ties in thecountry are on Pitt’s

V schedule this year. ‘If any man has

the ability to debate, and without any
good excuse fails to try~f.or the team,
‘he is doing an injustice to himself and
to hisAlma Mater. The same thing
may be saidof the man that has tal-
entsalong any other line of work
and refuses to take part. -

So let every man get down” to work
during the4 Winter months, both in
the matter of classroom work‘ and
the various lines‘ of student activities.
Remember that the-men that get the
most out cf their University life are
the men that put the most into it-
the ‘workers, not the wall ﬂowers.

been tastefully decorated with a pro-

gold and blue pennants and banners,
making a very appropriately deco-
rated c,'3ncert hall for this particular

imusical entertainment.

Aside from the many glee and man-

will be assisted by Mrs. Charles E.

Many of the members of the young
ladies’ organizations, as well as the
directors, are well known by Pitt stu-
dents, and these facts will serve as
additional inducements to attract the
University people to this concert.

Tickets for. this concert are being
sold by menrbers of both the Pitt
Mandolin and Glee Clubs at 5.0 cents
each. Those desiring tickets should

The Pitt Musical Clubs have made
an enviable record for themselves so

‘far this season, having already held

several .very successful concerts in
cities near Pittsburgh.’ As one of the
best organizations. for student enter-

Presented ‘to Laurence Barrett Hurst,
’U2, by the Athletic Association of
the University of Pittsburgh, in ap-
-preciation of his faithful service as
Graduate Manager of Athletics.
January 1, 1913.

When seen after the meeting by a
Pitt Weekly reporter, Mr, Hurst was
all smiles, and as ‘happy as a school
boy with a new knife.“ ‘He was too
excited torgive a very coherent ac-
count of how it all -came about, but
said that he could not find words to
express his thanks for his handsome
gift. ,

Nothing definite was done in the
matter of selecting, a football coach
for next season. It was rumored that
the selection of acoach would be
made at thismeeting, but the matt_er
was postponedto a later date.

The followzing officers were
elected to serve foranother term:

Dr. A. F. Judd, chairman; J. G.
Houston,Avice.chairman; C. W. Rid-
inger, treasurer; ,K. E. Davis, secre--
tary. » ' ,. .

A committee’ was appointed to
further consider and report on the
advisabilit_v of the University ‘joining
the V\7este‘rn Pennsylvania, Intercol-
legate League. The question has been
before the association for some time
and it is expected that deﬁniteaction
will be taken soon. A 1 .

Graduate Manager K. E. Davis has
opened his.new offices, 421-422 «Park
«building. They are ﬁrst class
inevery detail, and Mr. Davis in-
tends to havehis new headquarters
made one of the imost attractive of-
ﬁces in the city. Pictures of various
athletic teams and czfptvains will dec-
orate the walls’, so that any person
coming _to visit the graduate manager’
can secure a history of athletics’in the
University in picture form.

VVork on the football schedule for
next season is well under-way. It
will be the best schedule ever, accord-
ing to Mr". Davis.

Although the weather was very un-
favorable, .2. large crowd of Pitt and
Penn rooter§ turned‘ out and made the
gym echo with snappy cheers. Art
Giles and his lusty bandewere al '
there and aroused a lot of spirit in
the game. The result of the game-
was in doubt till the ﬁnal whistle,
which kept the large crowd on edge.

Pitt took.the lead at the start‘ when -
Frishman tossed two goals from the
foul line, but Penn tied the score
when Reisner scored in the same,
manner. Capt. Campbell put ‘the
Gold and Blue in the lead‘ again by
scoring a ﬁeld goal and the end of
the ﬁrst half found Pitt leading 12-10.

The Pittsburgh ﬁve earned their

victory as they seemed to have the _

best of the argument all the way

game and had an even chance at all
times.

- Baker put up agreat game, scoring
fourﬁeld goals and seven fpuls. Capt.
Campbell held his opponent in good

well. Frishman'wasn’t in his usual

which has been working out for the
last lmonth under Coach Provin is
to play its ﬁrst game of the season
this evening with the Westinghouse

team has been showing unusual form

in its practice games with the Varsity."

The team as itwi11_lin~e up this even-

PLANS FOR TRACK
MEET UNDER WAY

 

The track manager has already
started work on the,Eighth Annual
Intercollegiate and Interscholastic
Track’ and Field Meet which willbe
held at Sehenley. Oval on May 24th.
This meet ‘has become the most im-
piortant of the local track card and is
rapidly becoming of imp.ortance in» a

large section of country about Pitts-

burgh.

Last year the collegiate meet was
won by Pitt with W. &~]. second,
while Kiski nosed’Pittsburgh High
School out in an exciting ﬁnish. Over
three hundred athletes took part in
the 37 events and several records
were broken. It is thought that this
year’s meet will surpass any former
one as the collegiate invitation ,list

has been enlarged , greatly. Penn
State, Lafayette, Lehigh, Carlisley
Buciknell, Western Reserve, Ohio

State, Oberlin, W. & J. and several
others have been invited ‘and if three
or four of these ‘institutions are rep-
will’ be"
close and more records will fall.

I Pitt will send a relay team to the
Penn Relay Meet late in April as the
Gold and Blue has always been rep-
resented there. Ex-Capt. Bryson is
the only memberof last year’s team
who is lost, as Matt Marshall. Rosen-
t'hal and Davis are eligible to run
again, but there is a good chance for
others to make the team, as Marshall

- will probably be used in the half mile

and Capt. Rosenthal and Davis may
be used‘ in the sprints. Hazlett, who
ran a good quarter in Mayiin the
work hard to
make the Philadelphia trip this year.

"Wallace Thomas, the holder of the

mile intcrscholastic‘ record (4:35)
looks good for. the relay_team as he
can run both the quarter and half -in.

good time. Bane should develop into
a half ‘miller this year if he works‘
hard. A M A A A

Pitt will enter a full team’ in the
Y. M. C.iA. m_eet to be held at the
month, and Director
Miller who will coach the teamiis
anxious" that all men report at the
gym atonce. , ' '

Owing to certain conditions in this
section no other meets have been
scheduled yet, but several good meets
are in line and the schedule should
be an attractive one.

the athletic board, the most difﬁeult
schedule ever attempted by a Pitt
freshgen team. “ The ‘schedule _ will
consist of at least twelve games, of
which probably ﬁve will be away.
For the ﬁrst time in Pitt.’s history the

Quadrangular Meet _at .- P. A. A.
Gymnasium a Big Success.

At their annual business meeting
early infthe week, the Inltercollegiate
Fencing Association voted a member-
ship to the University of Pittsburgh,
which repaid the energies of Prof.
Geo. W. Postgate, his team and sav-
eral Pitt men who have worked to-
ward this end. The association in-
cludes such members as Yale, Prince-
ton, Harvard, Pennsylvania,iCo1-nell,
Columbia and Navy, and is one of the‘
most exclusive athletic organizations
in this country. The preliminary
bouts will be held in New York'City
and Annapolis, and the ﬁnals will be
held at Hotel Astor in New York at_
a later date. The latter bout is one
of the annual social
Astor. _ _

Fencing was started .at‘the Univer-
sity last year by. Prof.‘Postga.te and
others and immediately became pop-
ular among the students. _l A large’
class was formed «and early this‘ fall
a team of’ three men and one substi-
;tute was picked in a round robin
tournament. Prof.‘ Postgate then
made application for membership into
the Intercollegiate» Association , ‘and

made arrangements, to enter the team _

in the quadrangular meet between
Cornell, P. A. A., the German Club
of this city and the University ‘of
Pittsburgh. » A

This meet was held late last month

lthful Smoke, and the

Most Economical

THE most enjoyable smoke is ’a pipe.
But many irien refuse this method because
they-have had unhappy experiences with pipe
tobaccos. T

‘ Likely you have paid 35 cents to 50 cents
for a tin of fancy “mixture”, and it burned
your mouth or throat, or was unpleasantly
strong. - i *

»Too‘ bad9,—but- you got the wrong to-
bacco. Thehundreds 0 thousands of men
who have tried

The Perfect Tobacco for‘Pipe.and'Cigarctte

have found the"answer to their smoke prob-
lems. Tuxedo is the mildest tobacco made.
It cannot bite the tongue or dry the throat.

And it’s economical. There are 40 pipefuls
in a ten—cent tin. You can’t get any better tobacco
because nothing better grows than the mellow,
perfectly aged Burley leaf used in Tuxedo.

If you try Tuxedo for a month and cut out
other smokes, you will not only have had the best
month of smoking you ever had in your life, but
you will have made a mighty big saving in your
pocket-money! ‘
