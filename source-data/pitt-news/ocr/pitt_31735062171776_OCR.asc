  Maas Brands Apathy,  
Secrecy Crime Aids Program To Enhance

by STEVE zvcn

“Organized crime affects all citizens and the worst aspects of it
are the apathetic attitude of the public and the fact that its activities are
not obvious.” said Peter Mass, author of The Valachi Papers, at at
press conference and lecture here Tuesday.

Mass said that if La Cosa Nostra (translated literally as “this thing
of ours”) paid taxes_on only one-third of the money it siphoned illegally
from the economy, enough funds would be generated to “. . . eliminate
the 10 per cent tax surcharge.” » in

While admitting that the Cosa Nostra is not all’ of organized crime.
Mass calledit “the core of organized crime in America.” He also said
that “organized crime is strictly an American phenomenon and perhap
a reflection on our culture.” ~

Guessing at the annual “take” of organized crime in the U.S.,
Maas said that 40 billion dollars would be a “very conservative esti-
mate.” He cited Justice Department figures which placed the total as
high as $60 billion. -

Maas noted that “violence is still part of La Cosa Nostra.”

“They will have some ‘animals’ in the family," he said. He cited
a recent case in Boston where the “Mob” cut up and burned the body
of a delinquent lower echelon member as an example of “family
justice”. ' \

Maas suggested the legalization of gambling as one method of re-
ducing financial kickbacks to organized crime. In Maas’ opinion, “gab-
bling is a sport that will never be abolished. Therefore, the state should
get involved and at least channel the profits to some public_use.

“This kickback money is used by the ‘Mob’ to invest‘ in other prof-
itable and often very respectable fields like banks, the market, real)

- estate, and big business,” he said.

This illegal money, said Maas, is also used to buy and corrupt “po-
liticians, police officials, and especially the judges without whose pro-
tection the ‘Mob’ couldn’t survive.“ Maas went on to note that organ-
ized crime is “apolitical, it covers both major parties and is only in-
terested in money." . « .

As examples of the high level of the “Mob's" control, Maas accus-
ed former Supreme Court Justice Abe Fortas of being bought by the
“Mob." He said, “They got (Fortas) for only $20,000" through their
Parvin Foundation and Congressman Cornelius Gallager.

Gallagher, according to Maas, was seriouslybeing considered by
Lyndon Johnson in 1964 as a running mate, until the news media expos-
ed him and his strong underworld connections.

Maas believes this (the news media) one of the better organs to
use to combat organized crime. “The mob thrives on secrecy, and until
we rip off this mask of respectability many of them are hiding under.

Chancellor Wesley Posvar disclosed “very preliminary" plans
that call for the construction of a multi-level underground parking
lotrunderneath Schenley Plaza, the parking area between Hillman
and Carnegie Libraries.

At the Feb. l6 luncheon of the Oakland Kiwanas Club, Posvar
said that the projected lot would provide more than ample space
for University students and personnel and permit the Schenley Plaza
surface to be returned to a “more pleasant usage."

   
  
 
 
  
 
   

   
   
      
    
   
     
      
 
 

“The plaza," he said, “could become the centerpiece of the
architectural development of Oakland; it could really be attractive.
By the same token, we could use the top of the parking garage for

. recreation and other non-parking uses and make the entire area
something more than a huge parking lot/.' I ’

    
 

Neither Chancellor Posvar nor Jack Freeman was available for
further comment upon the disclosure.

Appointrnents Frozen

Financial Crisis Looms

At the beginning of March, the

‘University will be out of cash.

Edison Montgomery, Vice-Chan-
cellor of Finance, made this state-
ment Wednesday to the Pitt News.

“We have been operating the
last two months on the tuition
which came in January. It will be
exhausted when the- February
payroll is out.

In response to the University‘s
financial crisis, Montgomery is-
sued a directive demanding a
temporary freeze on all new ap-

pointments. It went into effect

last Friday.

The memorandum issued to all

Deans. Directors, and department

I chairmen, stated, “We have no

firm basis on which to judge what
the total state appropriations for
the current fiscal year will be. "

There will be no exceptions to
the freeze, according -to‘ the
//memo, unless, leaving a job un-
filled “would be extremely dele-
tarious to a program or would
create a physical hazard.”

Forty positions were pending
at the time of the directive and
these have been suspended. Com-
mitments were not ‘rescinded for
those that had‘ already been hired
and contracted.

Essentially, if someone hired
by the University leaves due to

“Policemen are prejudiced, but

Gene Toton, equating police stero-

New York policeman and Project
Director for the Pilot ‘Police

Orientation Subsidy   Debated

In a previous issue of the Pitt
News, an article written by Rich-
ard Box, Student Chairman of
Orientation stated, “The fresh-
men will have to pay -the entire
cost of orientation this year; as it
stands now there will be no addi-
tional financial support from the
University."

Bea Lampiris, Director of Ori-
entation, said that this was not
true, that “students do not have to

pay the entire cost of orientation-

this year."

“At the present time,” Lamp-
iris said, “there is an orientation
budget of $21,000 that has to be
approved by Bernard Kobosky,
the Vice Chancellor for Student
Affairs.”

She added that the budget cov-
ered many hidden costs to orien-
tation—speakers, audio-visual
materials and the salaries of “any
student help. The salaries include
that of Richard Box, who as Stu-
dent Orientation Aide, receives fi-
nancial renumeration for clerical
work.

Orientation Aide and Orienta-
tion Chairman are separate posts.‘

This year’s orientation budget
is dependent upon a blanket fee
from each freshman which pays
for a part of orientation program-
ming. Lampiris said that the sum
would be approximately nine dol-
lars per person.

There also will be housing costs

Montgomery also stated »t
the University will probably ha

“By the end of June, we it
probably have borrowed $22 ,mtl
lion,” Montgomery offered, “
this would amount to about $3 :

Montgomery hopes that who
Harrisburg does allocate rnonej
to the University there will

possibility of having to lay peop

Bonn and Hoenstine in New Posts
  Gormley to Renovate
Pitt News Editorial Staff

A significant change in The Pitt News organization will take
place March 15 as the new editor, Bill Gormley, assumes office.

The major organizational change instituted by Gormley involves
the planning of the paper one deadline in advance. Members of the
editorial board will meet prior to a deadline to plan the next paper.

“The editor maintains the responsibility for all areas of the news-
paper’s operation,” according to The Pitt News Executive Board.

Helping Gormley will be a new Associate Editor, Evan Pattak.
Pattak will be responsible for the literary and journalistic quality of
The Pitt News. ‘

Also aiding the editor will be an Executive Assistant, Sue Hoen-
stine. She will serve as a research assistant and an added channel of
communication. Much of her work will later be incorporated into
editorials. »

The Pitt News opinion pages will be handled by Bob Bonn,
serving in a newly-formed position of Opinion Editor. His, duties
will be to solicit columns, edit letters, and lay out the editorial pag-
es. Bonn will also try to provide columns which deal with the news
stories in other parts of the paper.

News articles will be determined by Pohla Smith, who will
serve as News Editor. Mark Matis will serve as Photography Editor.

Smith will be assisted in proofreading stories by three night edi-
tors veteran reporters Ellen Ganley, Judy Vollmer, and Mike Sim-
on.

Heading an expanded entertainment section in The Pitt News
will be Cindy Morgan, who will assign and edit all entertainment
stories. Planned are reviews of plays, movies, concerts, and records,
as well as an increase in book reviews.

Jerry Myers will serve as Sports Editor. He will be responsi-
ble for assigning and editing sports stories, laying out the sports
pages, and representing The Pitt News at all athletic functions.

Myers will be assisted by Marty Hellman, who will be the
Associate Sports Editor. .

the law. Other schools, including
Swathmore and Bryn Mawr, pre-
sented legal briefs supporting
Haverford.

Haverford contends that, with
this law, the PHEAA is ‘attach-

ing strings to its scholarships,

with the universities forced to act
as middlemen. “Schools shouldn‘-t
be made into reporting agencies
informing on their students." a
spokesman for Haverford told
The Pitt News. r“We work for
the students, not for the State. “

Haverford also feels that law’
discriminates against the poor,
penalizing students who may
wish to exercise their legal rights.

Since the PHEAA provides a

 

‘ w.

relatively small amount of aid
to Haverford students, Haverford
was able to test the regulation

‘without the threat of great mone-

tary sanctions. The College has,
however,‘ received pledges from
friends promising -to make up the
deficit should State funds be cut
off.

The three-judge panel delib-
erating the case has reached no
decision as yet. The Haverford
spokesman“ said that, should the
law be upheld, the school would
appeal to a higher court.

The State Legislature enacted

‘the controversial measure last

year in an effort to quiet student
unrest on Pennsylvania’s camp-
uses.

credited police training program.
However. Pitt and Boyce College
do offer programs in related

areas, such as sociology. that an ~

officer can receive a degree in.

-“The training is mandatory,
but viewed by the policemen as a
chance to become more profes-
sional,” said Toton. “We are of-
fering them upward mobility and
status, which is relevant to the
individual.” '

Currently, the types of training
programs being initiated are cad-
et, which is for men under‘ 21;
training for recruits; refresher
courses for current policemen;
special units, for officers inter-
ested in drugs, homicide, detec-
tive work, etc.; and supervisory,

.for officers assuming a-higher

rank.

According to Toton. participa-
tion by officers in the organiza-
tion of the program is important

‘because the goals of the program

must be set within the limits and
motivations of the man. Thus, the

core of the program is based on

small group discussions, which
will inform both the trainer and

trainee the direction in which they ’

are moving.

Because the training program
is a pilot course, ‘Toton said he
feels the benefits will not be im-
mediately felt by the community.
“We can only hope that our long-
range goals will produce fewer

errors on the part of the officer}

and generally a stronger feeling
of security and confidence on the

[part of the community." ,

Decay of Private Ethic  
  Reflected in Day Care

by FRANK DONATELLI
Staff Columnist

«The rise of big government in recent decades has certainly cre-
ed problems, — rampant inflation, unresponsive‘bureaucracies,

 
  
  
   
   
 
    
  
 
  
   
  
 
 
  
   
   
  
 
    
  
   
   
   
   
  
 
 
  
   
    
   
   
  
  
  
   
  
  
 
  

;Yet, if the problems created were merely economic,‘ we might

 to be able to weather the present crisis. Unfortunately, the
gelfarist philosophy of the New Deal lingers on and its side effects
ave been felt in other areas besides the economic.

Theregwas a, time in America when individual responsibility,
f-pride, and a genuine concern for others were part of the Ameri-
n ethic. Charles Reich might call it Consciousness 1.

People were held responsible for their own actions but were
till more than willing to voluntarily help a neighbor in distress.

, Unfortunately today, this type of personseems -to be more and

'3

st of problems, look to politicians and government ‘to wave their
ic wands and make everything right.

;Of course the coming of the Industrial Revolution destroyed the
se of community of many, and temporary governmental relief may

have been necessary. Suffice to
say, however, the state has gone
beyond this minimal service and
is now looked upon as the Moses
who will lead us to the promis-
ed Utopia. «

Professor Goets Briefs des-
cribes the process:

It seems, indeed, that in a direct
portion, as personal values become ab-
sorbed and dominated by the collec-
tivities, there is a general tendency
for private ethics to decay and be
replaced by ideological empire build-
ing. »

We see this process at work

all around us. Today we accept
state responsibility in areas which
have traditionally been left to
l the private sector.

This is illustrated very,well by the resolution recently adopted
it the Advisory Committee on Women’s Opportunities (ACWO). Al-
ost automatically, responsibility for the entire area of child care
5, ceded to the state. The resolution is replete with “The University
hould” or “The Federal Government should.”

 Now it is highly debatable whether the state should have ac-
cess to the unwashed minds of the young children entrusted to them.
- much better solution might involveobtaining voluntary contribu-
ions to set up a private institution.

;  Or better still, iflthe demand for this service is as great as the
Women insist it is, they could go into business to provide this need-
a service.

Professor Ernest Van den Haag has suggested this latter method.
 few oflthe mothers could be trained — very little «training would
gef needed —— in the essentials of -child-rearing, space could be rent-
‘dand a small fee could be charged for the service.

- Eventually, if the demand is great enough, more centers could
‘opened and the car quality would improve accordingly.

 

,-tate regulations, and an increasingly crashing burden of taxation.
ervices can be “free" only up to a point.

D As_ Robert Heinlein says, ‘There ain’t no such thing as»a free
iinchﬁ’ Schemes of redistribution can be carried only so far, and we
have seemed to pass that point. The productive can be taxed only so
much until they cease to be productive. V

7 Now I don’t cite this case because it is unusual. Indeed, the
ragedy is that it is typical. People seem more and more willing to
op-things themselves, preferring to let the state handle them.

 Even businessmen, once the epitomy of self-reliance, are turn-
rig, more and more to the state to relieve them of their responsibili-
s. '
P Yet there is no reason, for us to lose faith in the generosity of
 average citizen. Before the New Deal era, it wasn’t usual for
private charities to triple their previous year’s intake.

Even in 1969, when we "were (and still are) on the verge of
nfiscatory taxation, Americans were generous enough to donate al-
gost $3 billion of their hard-earned money to charity.

 The time is now to decide if the hallmarks of our society will
be “Liberty, Equality, Fraternity,” or, in the words of Travers Cle-
gent, “Cradle-to-grave Security, Full Employment, and Sixty Mil-
-ion Jobs.”

The ethic of self- responsibility has served us well. We should
‘think twice before abandoning it.

currently in circulation asking
for support -— political, monetary
and otherwise — for the Angela

tionary Socialist Union (RSU) are
behind the move. lndications of
support should be returned to:
Pittsburgh Committee to Free

362-9000.)

man, respected scholar, former

the Communist Party, fighter
against the oppression of all peo-

S from behind prison bars.

At the time of her arrest, she
was leading the effort to free the
Soledad Brothers and to elimin-
ate the degrading conditions ex-

isting in the prisons of Califor-

nia. These efforts were typical
of her devotion to the people and
their freedom.

We who are of the people,
sponsor Freedom for Angela Da-

tical beliefs and are committed

 

to no single political persuasion,
we are of one mind in regard
to Angela Davis.

We believe Angela Davis to be
innocent of the charges of kid-
napping and murder.

We believe that she is the ‘vic-
tim of a frameup which if allow-

ed to succeed will result, not
alone in death for Angela Dav-
is, but in the critical loss of free-
dom for us all. Her freedom will
hasten the freedom of other in-
nocent victims of political and
fascist repression who have fought
for justice and aroused the anger
of those in power.

(In signing the petition, in-
clude name, address and zip and

An interview with Davis pub-
lished in the current issue of
Ramparts magazine quoted her
as remarking: “In view of the
prolonged pre-trial imprisonment
I expect, I can only follow the
example of the Soledad Brothers.
The struggle against racism,
against all the evils engendered
by U.S. capitalism, must be car-
ried forth wherever we find our-
selves. My role, at present, is to
assist in the creation of another
front of struggle.” .

  FAS Policy Paperllon-operative

(Editor's Note: The following
statement has been released by
the members of the Pitt Profes-
sional Union, a fledging group
interested in obtaining collec-
tive bargaining rights for faculty
at all levels of qualification.
Further coverage of its activities
will be carried in future editions
of The Pitt News.)

The Pitt Professional Union
wishes to bring to the attention
of the University community the
fact that the policy paper, “Ap-

pointment, Reappointment, Re-

sponsibilities and Termination of
Appointment of’ Graduate Stud-
ents Involved in Teaching,”
which appeared in the FAS Ga-
zette of January 29, 1971, is not
operative and is not to be inter-
preted as official policy.

As the result of criticism aired

at. the most recent meeting of
the Faculty of Arts and Sciences

Council the paper was referred
back to the Graduate Council for
amendment.

 

The’ criticism centered around
the vagueness of. the paper’s
guidelines, the possible tendency
toward the paper’s imposing spe-

cial restrictions upon graduate
teachers not currently carried by
faculty, and the apparent ab-
sence of comments and advice
from a broad cross section of
graduate students and faculty,

A report of the FASC’s discus-
sion and action taken will appear
in the next issue of the FAS Ga-

, zette.

The Pitt Professional Union
therefore reminds graduate stu-
dents involved in teaching that
their teaching activities need
only to conform with the current
guidelines of their departments;
and department chairmen and
committees engaged in the selec-
tion and evaluation of graduate
students involved in teaching
are reminded that the policy pa-
per is not to be used to justify
either current departmental guide-
lines or any new guidelines that
may be drawn up in the future.

This would eliminate the need for unresponsive bureaucracies, .

  Feig ‘Misrepresented’

(Editor's Note:,Feature Editor
Evan Pattak wrote an analysis of‘
the intended abolition of the
Dean of Student Development's
office for the February 24 edition
of The Pitt News. The article,
an interview with Dr. Konnilyn
Feig, Director of Special Pro-
grams as part of the’ Dean's of-
fice, appeared on the editorial
page. Following is the response
from Dr. Feig.)

I feel that I must respond be-
cause the article does not accur-
ately present my views and con-
cerns.

It was my understanding that
The Pitt News was interviewing
all four Directors in order to
1) inform them of the abolition
of the Dean of Student Develop-
ment. And to 2) elicit from them
their views about the kind of
structure appropriateifor the fu-
ture. .

I said that I had no desire to
discuss personalities or the past,
nor did 1 say anything about
disagreements or disenchantment.

I did say that I had pondered
forvtwo or‘ three years the alter-
native structures for urban uni-
versities, that universities had
experimented with different
forms, and that none seemed to
be perfect.

I explained that I had just re-
turned from Denver where as a
member of the National Execu-
tive Board of. the National Asso-
ciation of Student Personnel Ad-
ministrators, I had, been in sev-

eral discussions about this ques-
tion.

As I pointed out, the position
of the Dean of Student Develop-
ment is being done away with at
many universities, primarily be-
cause areas‘ of speculation or
emphasis are being formed, and
the position of generalist or
“jack-of-all-trades" has been dif-
ficult to define and impossible
to fill, and exasperating for any-
one to attempt to perform.

\¢

One of the reasons has to do
with the elimination of the need
for anyone to spend a majority
of his time on discipline. (1 did
not say that discipline was
passe.)

In continuing to look toward
the future I remarked that I had
difficulty personally seeing a
need for a Dean of Student De-
velopment, and even more im-
portant, figuring out a realistic
way to define the position so that

   

in Analysis

administrators would find it chal-
lenging. 1

Since the move to the twelfth

floor occured because of space ’

problems, and since these prob-
lems will soon be resolved, I
have never viewed it as either
symbolic or symptomatic, and
it is not central to an analysis
of possible models.

I wish that TheiPitt News had
had the opportunity to interview

the other Directors in order to’

gain a more comprehensive View
of ideas about future reorgani-
zation.

(Editor's Note: Part of this column
is a reprint from a Guardian supple-
ment on Genocide in Vietnam.)

Genocide is a comparatively new
word. It has been in dictionaries for
only 25 years. Genocide means the de-
liberate and systematic extermination of
a national or racial group. stemming
from the Greek prefix “geno". meaning
"race“. and the suffix “cide“ which
means to “kill".

Its political roots today are imperial- A

ism -— the stage of capitalism in which
national or racial groups are oppressed
for profit; and racism —- the system of
white supremacy which justifies the op-

pression of non—whites on the basis that L

they are “interior” or less human.

Genocide isn’t new. of course. There

are many instances in history, such as
the extermination of the Native Ameri-
can population, but they were given dif-
ferent names. “Bringing civilization to
the savages" is one. “Bringing Chris-
tianity to the heathens” is another.

Developing the West, Mainfest Des-
tiny, expanding markets, and even pro-
tecting democracy are all names that
have been used (and the latter is still
being used) in place of genocide.

The word itself was coined to des-
cribe the Nazi extermination of the
Jews. Hitler did not really pretend that
his racial policy was anything else
and he had the technological means to
accomplish extermination more advanc-
ed than ever before.

Vietnam: Systematic Exterminat

Itum\“‘

g f .

Regardless of the current set of de-
finitions used to describe U.S. actions
in Vietnam, the word there too is geno-
cide. A national group, the Vietnamese
people, is being exterminated. A com-
bination of imperialism white suprem-
acy and technological means are ravag-
ing the people and the land of Vietnam.

Imperialism? Because the United
States has invaded Vietnam to prevent
an oppressed people from realizing their
goal of self-determination and national
independence. Forgetting the endless
pretexts, the U.S. violated the interna-
tional law and its own Constitution to
prevent the people of Vietnam from de-
ciding their own destiny.

If‘Vietnam “fell". so might the oth-
er poor countries from which the
U.S. exploits cheap labor and material
and sells it for a profit.

White supremacy? Vietnam is Asian...
Yellow. Inferior. What is a Vietnamese
death? What matters the destruction
of a Vietnamese village? Of what sig-
nificance is the torture of Vietnamese
women? Or the starvation of a Viet-
namese child‘? They are Asian and life
is cheap.

Over a million Vietnamese civilians
have been slaughtered in this war,
largely /by American firepower. Their
homes, .their lives, their crops, their
aspirations are cheap. This is the ideolo-
gy of white supremacy. It makes im-
perialism easier to accept.

Songmy hit world consciousness
like a hammer. But the history of U.S.
atrocities in Vietnam is history’s most
publicized crime. It has been shown on

Harold Pinter’s plays are simple stories told with an economy
of language that isolates and captures the thundering banalities and
silences of human communication. To put this kind of drama on the
screen is extremely challenging. Films have always seemed to be most
effective in dealing with physical action while silences on the screen
have usually resulted in intense audience boredom. In THE BIRTHDAY
PARTY, director William Friedkin in his first film solves this problem
without having to resort to cheap visual excitement at the expense of
the play’s integrity. He has created the suspense and tension of a
mystery while retaining both Pinter’s shadings of whispers and shouts
as well as his ironic, deadly humor. Friedkin’s talent in this area has
again been proven by his most recent film, THE BOYS IN THE BAND. .

Pinter’s world is a literary and dramatic microcosm in which
insignificant details are amplified to create climaxes from situations
which would otherwise go unnoticed. A sense of menace and primitive
fear occurs throughout his work similar to when an -innocent drop of
water is seen through a microscope to ‘contain a teeming unseen life.

situations. We find ourselves in a bizarre world of ambiguous, abstract
thoughts surrounded by alarmingly specific objects because Pinter con-
sciously eliminates any rational explanation of either his perspective or
his characters’ motivations.

The film gains additional power through its brilliant casting. As
the man whose birthday it is, Robert Shaw is the very embodiment of
fear and guilty repression. Shaw has always been associated with Pinter
and his performance in THE CARETAKER and his new career as a
playwright (THE MAN IN THE CLASS BOOTH) have made him one
of the major figures of British and American theatre and films. The
supporting cast is equally memorable. Dandy Nichols, one of Britain's
most popular television stars plays the landlady. Patrick Magee, unfor-
gettable as the Marquis de Sade in MARAT...SADE joins with the
splendid Sidney Taﬂer as Shaw's sinister Irish and Jewish tormentors.

The combination of cast, Pinter and director Friedkin have cre-
ated a memorable tour de force in a universe you might not want to
live in, but one in which you will have a stunning visit.

On the same program, we have included a remarkable short film,
FIFTH STREET. Robert MacAndrew has delved powerfully and sensi-
tively into the world of derelicts in Los Angeles to produce a document
that is sometimes shocking and painful, but never banal or gratuitous.

ll/[aster Plan Formiila

(Continued from Page 3)

Another proposal in the Master Plan would evaluate each uni-
versity on the basis of how many of its graduates are contributing to
the commonwealth, for example, by living and working within the

‘,_ state, and paying taxes.

Pettigrew said, “This would be impossible for a school the size
of administer. We have so many alumni that it would entail huge

expenses to keep track of them."

Arnold and Montgomery said the basic problem is the need for a

‘ state system of evaluation of budgetary requests by universities and

some means -of obtaining operating funds while still maintaining

academic integrity.

Both indicated there is little likelihood that any new budgeting
system will be operating before 1972. Arnold pointed out the univer-
sities are doing all they can to cooperate with the state in arriving
at a formula acceptable to both parties.

The only thing all authorities seem certain of. however, is. as
Arnold said, “There will definitely be some sort of formula even-

IILASSIFI

Leue.- from Berrigan:
  Time is Momentous

(Editor's Note: Following is the
first installment of Father Dan Ber-
rigan’s letter to the Weathermen. It
is a condensed transcription of a
tape recorded in August, 1970,
three days before Berrigan was or-
rested by the FBI for his alleged
role in a plot to bomb the ventilat-
ing system of a Washington build-
ing complex. In it, Berrigan speaks
from rough notes, not from a writ-
ten text. The statement as follows
was excerpted by Paul Cowan of
The Village Voice.)

Dear Brothers and Sisters.

This is Dan Berrigan speaking.
I want to say what a very deep
sense of gratitude I have that the
chance has come to speak to you
across the underground.

It‘s a great moment when I can,
rejoice in the fact that we can at
last start setting up a dialogue
that I hope will be a continuing
thing through the smoke signals.
all with a View to enlarging the
circle of those who realize the
times demand not that we narrow
our method of communication but
that we actually enlarge it if any-
thing new oranything better is go-
ing to emerge.

I'm talking out of a set of rough
notes and my ideas was that I
could not only discuss these ideas
with you but possibly publish
them.

The cold war alliance between
politics, labor, and the military
finds many Americans at the
right end of the cornucopia.

What has not yet risen in them
is the question of whose blood is
paying for all this, what families
elsewhere are being blasted, what
separation and agony and death
are the other side of that coin of
the realm——the connections are
very hard to make, and very few
come on them. and many can
hardly imagine that all being
right with America means that

very much must go wrong else-
where.

How do we get such a message
across to others? It seems to me
that that is one way of putting the
very substance of our task. Trying
to keep connections. or to create
new ones. It‘s a most difficult job.
and in hours‘ of depression it
seems all but impossible to speak
to Americans across the military

 

and diplomatic and economic idio-
cies—and yet I think we have to
carry our reflection further and
realize that the difficulty of our
task is the other side of the judg-
ment Americans are constantly
making about us.

This determination to keep talk-
ing with all who seek a rightful
place in the world or all who have
not yet awakened to it, this, I
think, is the revolution, and the
United States perversely and neg-
atively knows it, and this is why
we are in trouble.

And this is why we accept trou-
ble and ostracism and the fear of
jail and of death, as the normal
conditions under which decent
men are called upon to function
today.

Undouxtedly the FBI comes af-
ter people like me with guns be-
cause deeper than their personal
chagrin and their corporate ma-
chismo. which is a kind of debas-

ed esprit de corps since they al- ,

ways get their men, there was
that threat that the Panthers and
the Vietnamese had learned so
well as a reality.

The threat is a very simple one
because we are making connec-
tions, political connections, reli-
gious and moral connections, con-
nections with prisoners and Cu-
bans and Vietnamese, and these
connections are forbidden under
policies which J. Edgar Hoover is
greatly skilled both in enacting
and in enforcing.

They know by now what we are
about, they know we are serious.
And they are serious about us.

Just as with a mortal fear for
the last five years they have
known what the Vietnamese are
about and the Brazilians and the

Angolese and the Guatemalans.
We are guilty of making connec-
tions. or urging others to explore
new ways of getting connected. of
getting married. of educating chil-
dren. of sharing goods and skills.
of being religious, of being human.
of resisting.

I am speaking for prisoners and
exiles and that true silent, deathly
silent majority which is that of
the deadvand the unavenged as
well as the unborn, and I am guil-
ty again of making connections
with you.

By and large the public is petri-
fied of you. There is a great my-
thology surrounding you—much
more than around me. You come
through in public as another em-
bodiment of the public nightmare

which is menacing and sinister

and senseless and violent: a spin-
off of the public dread of Panthers
and Viet Cong. of Latins and Afri-
cans. and the poor of our coun-
try. of all those expendable and
cluttering and clamorous lives
who have refused to lie down and
die on command or to perish at
peace with their fate, or to exist
in the world as suppliants and
slaves.

But in a sense, of course, your
case is even more complicated
because your choice to rebel is
not the passionate consequence
of the stigma of slavery. Yours is
a choice. It's one of the few mo-
mentous choices in American his-
tory. Your no could have been a
yes, and the society realizes it be-
cause you had everything going
for you. Your lives could have
been posh and secure, but you said
no. And you said it, moreover, by
attacking the very properties you
were supposed to have inherited,
a very amazing kind of turnabout.

The society, I think, was trau-
matized. What to do with Viet
Cong or Panthers had never been
a very complicated matter, after
all. We jailed them or shot them
down or brought in the National
Guard. But what to do with you-
this indeed was one hell of a ques-
tion. 4

There was no blueprint and no
answer. And yet this question,
too, was not long in being answer-
ed, as we learned at Kent State.
That is to say, when property and
the question of survival come up
close, the metaphor is once more
invariably military. It is lives
that go down.

And now we know that even if
those lives are white and middle-
class, they are going to be in the
same gun-sights.

Pitt News Drama Critic

Much of the reason for the suc-
cess of 1776 icurrent produc-
tion at the Nixon Theatre) is its
unusual and exciting treatment of
the “historical event.“ Dealing
with the immediate actions sur-
rounding the commitment to (and
signing of) the Declaration of In-
dependence. it is a refreshing
treatment of the 4th of July . . .
"firecracker."

History has treated the story of
“The Declaration" with respect.
So much so. that the characters
and times have been bronzed,
plastered. and “stoned to death."
as the personality, realiness, and
wit of its memory has been ex-
cluded. 1776 has been buried for-
years in wax museums and color-
ful pageants. It is therefore en-
lightening to see this bit of history
from a “new viewpoint . . . as tak-
en from the letters between John
Adams and his wife, Abigail, dur-
ing those furious times.

It is clear that it is John Adams
fight and victory. It is also clear
that Ben Franklin, who is not only
a dear old man. but a partner is
clearly responsible for Adams‘
whenever he slips. Other things
are evident. The Congress ex-
pounds. “Adams . . . you are ob-
noxious and disliked."

Adams relates to his wife,
“Send Salt-Peter!” and Abigail
replies, “John, only if you send
Pins!” We see them barter and
bicker, “This is a revolution! We
are going to have to insult some-
body!”

Jefferson sends a note to
Adams. “Please go home, I am

"Girnrne Shelter”

 

taking my wife to bed. Ben
Franklin remarks about his son.
“Why did they arrest the little
bastard?“

As a musical comedy. it is a
good example of a good book, su-
perb lyrics and music. an imag-
inative and creatively functional
set. lovely costumes. and creative
choreography. all forming a de-
lightful production. It is also an
example of fine stage diction and
delivery and excellent acting
spread over a well-balanced cast.
the first National Company.

 

Direction by Peter Hunt is fine,
yet somewhat unimaginative in
many respects and only saved in
many instances by Onna White’s
choreography.

Patrick Bedford. as John
Adams, delivers a fine perform-
ance. His voice is more than ade-
quate for song. and his total exe-
cution of his role justifies every
minute (and its most of the show)
when he is on stage. Jack Mur-

    

dock is brilliant at times in his
role as John Hancock as is Rex
Everhart who “grows on you" as
the charming, witty. and exceed-
ingly clever Ben Franklin.

Virgil Curry is exciting and de-
velops a full character as Rich-
ard Henry Lee especially when he
sings one of the brighter moments
in the score “The Lees of Old Vir-
ginia.”

Michael Davis, as Edward Rut-
ledge, highlights the show with a
strong dramatic presentation as
well as one of the comedy’s best
executed musical numbers “Mo-
lasses to Rum.” His voice is out-
standing.

Barbara Lang as Abigail Adams
is delightful as is Kristen Banfield
as Martha Jefferson. Both exhibit
outstanding executive in the mu-
sical area of this production, as
does Michael Glenn-Smith in his
single but extremely effective
‘p‘Mamma Look Sharp."

The rest of the cast is also fine
and serve to round out one of the
finest company’s ever to come to
the Nixon.

In total 1776 is a strong mu-
sical comedy. It’s theme is rele-
vant and its presentation in story
and music is fresh and exciting.
What better combination and rea-
son to stop down to the Nixon The-
atre this or next week.

1776 will play the Nixon un-
til March 6. Evening perform-
ances are at 8:30 pm. every day
except Sunday. Matinees are giv-
en on Wednesday and Saturday af-
ternoons.

greedy and ignorant promoters
putting a show together at the last
moment plus an unexpected at-
tack on Jagger plus 300.000 peo-
ple mixing cheap booze with cheap
drugs plus the Hells Angels. That
culminating in a brutal murder.

As a consumer guide of sorts I
should perhaps point out that
those wanting a Woodstock or
Monterey Pop might be disap-
pointed. Besides the Stones there
are only Ike and Tina Turner (only
Tina appears on camera). the Jet-
ferson Airplane singing “The
Other Side of This Life" badly and
being interrupted when a Hells
Angel knocks Marty Balin uncons-
cious. and an unnamed warm-up
group.

Gimmie Shelter is not so much
a concert as an expose of one. The
Maysles might have sold the mo-
vie with the slogan “See the mur-
der‘ you’ve read about.” This too
would be logical, but apparently
too much for even the Maysles.

Gimmie Shelter has a similar
effect, it is a magnificent bad trip.
Although I despise everything that
thevmovie——its makers, stars and
accomplices—stand for, I must
give my sympathy to the devil.

Title: Dealing or The Berkeley to
Boston.

Author: “Mir:haeI Douglas,” 6.95.
by THOMAS NETTER

(Memo: From the desk of Modern
Youth Culturefiction Editor.)

Well, I read the book, man. I
kind of like it. Relevant it is—but
there’s a catch. It’s got what it
takes, that’s for sure. But before
I get into what I think of the book,
let me tell you a little about it.

It’s all about this guy, see, who
goes to Harvard and he’s a dope
runner. He trips out to California,
does a few joints in the bathroom
on the plane, just misses getting
busted, runs into some people on
the Berkeley scene, then does get
busted, gets off, then meets this
groovy “chick" and makes his
connection and brings the “stuff"
back to the East Coast.

Well, when he gets back he runs
into all kinds of hassles with his
connection in the East, but main-
ly he’s hung up on this chick he
met in Berkeley. So he finally gets
her to run a big quantity to the

The next few weeks will be
busy ones for the University of
Pittsburgh Womens Choral. Af-
ter a term of relative inactivity.
the women are presently prepar-
ing for four concerts which will
take place within the next three
weeks.

Last Sunday the members pre-
sented three religious pieces at
a concert held in Heinz Memori-
al Chapel with the Men's Glee
Club and the Heinz Chapel Choir
Yesterday the women traveled to
Grove City College for a concert
with their men‘s chorus.

Grove City will return the visit
next Thursday and the two groups
will present a concert in the Car-
negie Lecture Hall at 8:30 p.m.
Thursday, March 11, the women
will leave for a three day stay in
Cleveland, Ohio, where they will
perform with the men’s chorus of
Case Western Reserve Universi-
ty, and present a concert at Col-
lingswood High School in Cleve-
land.

The Choral’s music this year is
more contemporary than in the
past. In addition to selections
from such popular musicals as
Oliver,-Fiddler on the Roof, and
The Fantastiks, they have also
been working on pieces like Scar-

East so he can see her, all ex-
penses payed. Get it? But there’s
a catch. On the way to Boston she
loses the bag she’s got the dope
in, and that’s where they get the
title. Very clever, huh?

So the rest of the book deals
with how they manage to get her
off. They swing some crazy deal,
see, they manage to get hold of
the dope and trade it for the
chick. Very exciting scene. Lot’s
of tension, you lot’s of hustle in-
volved, you know, kind of makes
a point about values, right. Very
clever.

Well, as I said. this book’s got
what it takes. Sex, dope, obscen-
ity, excitement. groovy language,
a freaky slice of life, so to speak,
you know. It comes really close
to being a best-seller book, you

know, pretty close to being some-.

thing that in a couple of months
everybody’ll be reading, talking
about, but mainly spending money
on. Right? I ‘

The guy who wrote it, “Mich-
ael Douglas," well it isn't just one
cat. Actually its two. You re-
member, Michael Cricton 0 An-

The prose isn’t bad. Not bad at
all. It’s short and you can sit down

hell. Some places I couldn’t put it
down. The main character just
jumps from one wild trip to an-

There’s one catch though. Yeah.
Only one thing. I’m afraid that the
book doesn‘t take itself too seri-

dope dealer trades stolen dope for
a busted-. chick. Or the way our
dealer talks to the cops? Well, I
just don’t think that its all that
easy. I think that’s what “Mich-
ael Douglas” means; it comes off
as kind of a nutty farce, a kind of
humerous look at something very
serious. He doesn’t try to make a
big tragedy, a big timeless work
of art out of the whole thing. He’s
just writing this zany story about
the escapades of a couple hustlers.

Matmen To Battle
Top Eastern Team

by MIKE MILLER

Pitt Assistant wrestling coach Dick Slutzky is considering filing
assault and battery charges against Penn State after the Nittany
Lions take on the Pitt grapplers tomorrow at the Field House. I

Slutzky expresses this pessimism after regarding the depleted
state of the mat line-up as the grapplers prepare to take on the top

team in the East.

Pitt Head Coach Dave Adams is a littlemore hopeful.

“On paper we haven’t got much
of a chance, but you don’t
wrestle these things on paper.
We’re going to try to go out
there and take it to ‘em,” stated
Adams.

Harrison Leads Cats

- I Past WestminsterStall

by JERRY MYERS
Associate Sports Editor

After some very tense mo-
ments, in a mistake-filled con-
“. test, the Pitt Panthers won their
home finale against a hustling
Westminster squad 72-63, at the
Field House on Wednesday
night. ~

Priming for a three-game road
swing that will conclude their
1970-71 campaign, the Pan-
thers were riddled by the Titans
for the entire contest. The 15
turnovers the Cats committed in
the first half (there were 22
over-all) is a strong enough in-
dication of this fact.

After the game. Pitt Coach
Buzz Ridl mentioned to a mem-
ber of the opposition down in
the dressing room, “We tried to

4-«._

give it to you, and_ you wouldn’t
take it.” Ridl of course was re-
ferring to the ballgame.

In one of his rare starting
roles, Buzzy Harrison kept the
Panthers moving. His 23 points,
high for both teams, allowed
the Cats to maintain a lead
throughout the contest. His
18 rebounds were one shy of
the Pitt all-time record.

“Buzzy pulled us through all
right,” commented Ridl. And
Assistant Coach Fran Webster
echoed Ridl’s sentiments saying,
“Buzzy, he’s one kid who play-
ed a solid game.” ~

The only other ballplayer to

reach double figures for Pitt was

senior Bill Downes. Downes, in
his last game in the Field House,
fired in 6-for-8 from the field,

while making one-for two from
the charity stripe to give him a
total of 13 -points on the night.
The fans gave him a standing
ovation when he sat down for
the last time on the Field House
bench, with about six minutes
left in the game.

From the outset Westminster
indicated that they were there
to play. Surprising Ridl and the
Panthers, the Titans went into
the same stall they employed
two weeks ago in New Wil-
mington against the Cats. This
time it worked to the tune of a
28-21 halftime score. For most
of the half, the margin separ-
ating the two teams was less
than that.

“I was surprised when they
stalled us,” said Webster. “May-
be iht worked right tonight. They
(the Panthers). were anxious.
They were trying to get the ball
in the hoop before they had
the ball." . ‘

Although things settled down
a bit for the Panthersin the
second half, it was far from an
easy victory. The Titans whittled
down a Pitt 21-point lead in the
last 10 minutes to 66-57 with a
minute and a half left." But it
was too little, too late and the
Panthers won by that same nine
point bulge, 72-63.

“They played good defense,”
commented Ridl about the Ti-
tans. “They’re a good team.”

With their record standing at
14-7, the Cagers have a five-
game winning streak under their
belts. They take this to Univer-
sity Park where they’ll meet
the Nitany Lions of Penn State
University in the ECAC Game
of the Week tomorrow.

The game starts at 2:30 pm.
and will feature a PSU squad
that has only lost once in their
home gym, Rec Hall. That was
a close contest with Syracuse

around the middle of the sea-
son.

   

 

Despite the extensive casualty
list, there will be some hotly con-
tested matches.

Penn State’s two top, un-
defeated matmen will meet
stiff competition from the Pan-
thers.

158 pounder Clyde Frantz,
who has maintained a 10-0
record, will challenge Pitt

Freshman John Chatman, who
is 9-1.

Andy Matter, another unde-
feated Penn Stater, will probably
be matched with Jim Flemming
at 167 pounds.

Bob Kuhn is still not schedul-
ed to, wrestle for Pitt due to a
shoulder injury. Kuhn was ex-
pected back ‘in the line-up for
Syracuse, buthis injury has not
sufficiently healed.

Though John Chatman is in
the tentative line-up, his appear-
ance may“ be doubtful. Chatman
has been wrestling the second
half of the season with a back
injury.

Lately, he has not been able
to practice properly due to the
injury.

According to Adams he’ll
wrestle, “If he’s ready.”

The coach is reluctant to
lable the upcoming bout as the
toughest of the season, consider-
ing the defeat suffered at the
hands of Navy.

However, he considers his team

Penn State survived their en-
counter with Navy with a 17-17
draw. PSU has maintained a sea-
son record of 9-0-1 as opposed
to Pitt’s 8-2-1. .

The Lions have been at full
strength all season, not "suffer-
ing from injuries as Adams’
men have been.

The match will start at 2 p.m.
in the Field House.

25 Track-sters
At  Delaware

by VINCE DiNARDO

With the IC4A’s just a week away, Pitt Coach Jim Banner’s
track team is making a last ditch effort to qualify more athletes in

that meet. With this in mind, Banner is taking the largest contin-

gent of tracksters with himto the Delaware Invitational tomorrow
night. 25 tracksters will make the trip to Delaware.

“We want to give some of these guys some competition before
the IC4A’s”, said assistant track coach Don Mollenhauer. “We want

to give them the chance for some
good qualifying times.”

A reflection of Mollenhauer’s
words can be seen in the events
the tracksters will run.

iFor instance, Smittie Brown,
who has already qualified to
run in the 600, will not compete
in that event in order to give
Ted Bobby a chance to qualify.

Also, Ken Silay will get a
chance in the 880-yard dash in-
stead of John Aiken, who has al-
ready qualified. Brown and Aiken
will get a chance to compete in

otherevents.

Aiken will run in the 1,000-
yard run and the distance med-
ley, and Brown will also run in

the distance medley while still"

running in the mile relay.

Gary Risch will enter the
50-yd dash, and Rick Carosielli
and Bill Kalchthalter will com-
pete in the high hurdles. Risch
won the right to go to Dela-
ware in a runoff race on Wed-
nesday.

 

Because of a groin injury,
Bryant Salter will not high
jump at Delaware, but, he will
triple jump. John Wilborn will
do the high jumping and either
John Simpson or Steve Hein
will shotput.

Bill Rea. along with triple
jumping, ‘will also enter the

broad jump. Al Benaglio will,

round out the field events, pole-
vaulting.

John Black and Ken Balkey
will run the mile, while Jerry
Richey will run the two mile

as well as the mile in the dis- E

tance medley.

The mile and two-mile relay
teams will also be at Delaware.

Mostof the athletes will be’ 

in more than one
and the success of the

competing
event,

meet will show what depth Pitts
will have in the Nationals and.
the IC4A’s. ’

Battling back from a four-point deficit at halftime, the Soul
Brothers, on a game-winning jumper by Marty Davis, nipped Beth-

' Bethune-Cookman got off to a blazing start in the first half,
and with two minutes remaining in that stanza, led 25-19. Strong
rebounding by Fran Cramer and Ed, Paluzzi, coupled with the ac-

By JAN FRY

The swimmers travel to Kent
State tomorrow for their last dual
meet of the season, and it should
be one of their toughest.

The Golden Flashes, boasting a
9-0 season thus far, have raced
through such strong squads as
Miami, Kentucky and Ohio Uni-
versity (Ohio U. took the Mid-
American Conference Champion-
ship last year.)

Ted Hammargren, a junior,
leads the Kent team in freestyle.

(. This season he broke the Miami

pool record in the 500-yard with
a time of 4:58.6, and the Ohio U.
pool record in the 100. “He should
win the 1000 and 500 events han-
dily,” stated Pitt Acting Coach

 

beats him, it‘ll be quite an ac-
complishment.”

In regard to the breaststroke,
butterfly and backstroke events,
Bradshaw admits that Kent State
is much stronger. NCAA candidate
in the backstroke, Jerry Muske,
swam a 55.3 low in a previous
Kent State meet and is expected
to take that event. Also freshman,
Gary McGinnis, has taken the
200 butterfly in 2:03.2 seconds,
which makes him quite a chall-
enge from Pitt’s Dave Anderson.

In diving Gradshaw believes,
“Dave Wessel will have a good
time trying to beat Kent State’s
Gary Bishop in the one-and three-
meter. They’re both about the
same caliber.” Wessel and Bishop

have both qualified for the East-
erns and Nationals.

 A Long
  Way...But

The Pitt Hockey Club will be hosting a second game at the’
Alpine Ice Chalet in Braddock Hills this Sunday, and I still find
it hard to believe that the group has made it that far in a couple
of months. - .

When freshman Joe Testa came to the office in December,
I told him the didn’t,have much chance at organizing a hockey
team at Pitt because of a lack of interest and a lack of finances.

I’ve been proven wrong as far as interest is concerned. The

W group has formed into a very sound skating team and a follow-

ing appears to be growing. But what about finances?

At last week’s opener, friends of the Hockey Club asked for
donations to pay for uniforms and equipment since the group
hasn’t obtained any funds from the StudentAssociation’s (SA’s)

‘ Allocation Committee.

The Allocations Committee is the only hand of the SA that
can appropriate the needed cash, but they are not to blame for
the Hockey Club’s plight. They aren’t permitted to give money
to groups unless the organizations are officially recognized by
the SA’s Committee on Student Organizations (CSO).

 The Hockey Club has met with the CS0, and Testa reports

that he was informed that a letter of recognition would be on its
way. That was about two weeks ago and Testa has seen no sign
of the letter.

Delay in recognition is not unusual with the CS0. It has
been known for its massive holdups, which are caused by the
numerous applications for club status.

What is most discouraging about the delay concerning the
Hockey Club and any other student group attempting to gain
official recognition is that students were told the red tape would
be cut—-if not eliminated completely—when the Student Associa-
tion and its new constitution replaced the old, inept Student Gov-
ernment. The campus leaders said that any group seeking the
formal status should be permitted to have it. .

Apparently such plans have gone awry.

One of the four SA Commissioners, Denny Consilla, told
me the other day that the CS0 continues to operate as it has in
the past. “Sometimes it takes up to a year to get that letter,” he
said. it

Some members of the‘Hockey Club would like to see their _'
team eventually enter into varsity competition. But before’ that -

can happen, the club needs the aid of the student representa-
tives. The hockey players can prove to the Athletic Department
that they can operate on a relatively inexpensive budget if the
SA gives them the chance.

It ’ all *

As the college basketball season nears an end it is interest-

ing to note that quite a few of the Panther opponents have had -

excellent years, proving true the pre-season billing of the tough
Pitt schedule.

Teams with the impressive marks going into this week’s V.

action are: UCLA, 20-1; Fordham, 20-1; Duquesne, 19-2; Sy-

racuse, 16-5; Rutgers, 13-5‘; Georgia Tech, 16-7; and Lafay- '

ette, 15-7.
- Four of the Panthers’ seven losses have been registered

"A-Jagainst that group. And five or six of those teams should be in-

 

vited to at least one of the post-season tournaments’.

 Hope of Beating Kent

Last season Kent State splashed
Pitt, 69-44, and as Bradshaw re-
marked, “We probably don't have
a chance this year. However.
were really working towards
Easterns. We want to_end the
season the way a team’s supposed
to—with lower times."

Thus far the Pitt swimmers who
have qualified for Easterns include
freestylers Rickie Rowe in the
1000, 500 and 200, Tom Hayes in
the 50 and Fred Lewis in the
1000 and 500. Dave Anderson made
it in the 200 butterfly, and in div-
ing Dave Wessel, Martin Staley
and Ron Ludwig have all quali-
fied.

Bradshaw stated that although
Mark Cohen hasn’t qualified yet,
he should in this meet. “I’ve
never seen Mark swim the way
he has this year in college. He’s

really improving.”

 

  

 
  
  
  

 
 
  
  

  
  
  
 

JIM HOWELL
Pitt Freestyler

The line-up will be juggled
around this meet as in the last,
and as freestyler Hayes stated
“they might be surprised in
some events.” “However,” he con-
tinued, “we’re not worried. We’re
really not anxious to beat them-
just to improve our individual
times.”

Cubs Demolish Titan

Frosh For

1 1th Win

by MARTY HELLMAN

The Cubs’ overall height proved to be the key difference once
again on Wednesday night as they crushed the Westminster fresh-
men, 95-59 for their seventh straight victory.

‘It was the second easy win of the year for: the Cubs over the
Little Titans and upped their season record to 11-4.

Throughout the contest, the Cubs were able to clear the de-
fensive boards and used the fast break to the utmost. As a squad,

the frosh totalled 70 rebounds.

Jim Bolla and Lance Wall both had 14 rebounds to lead the

Pitt squad.

Five Cubs hit double figures,
and all members of the squad saw
considerable action in the one-
sided game.

Mickey Martin took top scor-
ing honors again with 17 points,
followed by Sam Fleming’s 15
while Bolla and Bill Swartzman
each had 14.

Wall, who returned to action
after sitting out with a knee in-
jury, showed aggressive offen-
sive rebounding as he got 10
points.

Although the Cubs committed
28 turnovers, Coach. Tim Grugu—
rich was pleased with the team’s
play. “In the second half they did
real well and most of those turn-
overs occurred at the end of the
game,” he said.

Westminister coach George
Waggonner commented after the
game,” We can’t cope with their
size. Between the last time we
played you and now, we lost our

-biggest man (6-6) because he

dropped out of school.”

With only two games left on
the schedule for the Cubs, Grgu-
rich’s squad is approaching his
best season ever at Pitt. Wins
over the Penn State Frosh tomor-
row afternoon and the West Vir-
ginia Little tMountaineers will
leave the Cubs one short of Grg-
uri(;h’s best of 14-4 several
years ago. D

Grgurich stated after the game
“I’m glad that we got a chance
to give everyone an amount of
playing time because we’re not
trying to overwhelm anybody.”

The Pitt gymnastics team will
have their hands full with Syra-

cuse tomorrow at Syracuse, dise _

pite the Orangemen 1-6 record.

Syracuse has been averaging

better than 135 points per match.

And depending on how many‘f.C '
people are injured on Coach.War- " 
ren Neiger’s Pitt squad, the local~?‘;‘»"
gymnasts score between 125- 140,.’ F
This week the higher figure B  f _
should apply for the first time  '

since the season began in that

there are no injuries on thesquad." _. 

Syracuse is led by an outstand-
ing still ring performer, George
Stalter. A

This season Stalter is undefea‘t- 
ed in eight consecutive matches. 
Among his list of victims is,’ ' 
Penn State’s Marshall Avenerf,,“- ',
who competed in the world games 

last year.

Stalter has not scored below?‘ 
9.25 this season, making him an;;;
impressive foe for Pitt’s Jim Bilec  _
and Frank Swift, who both score 2

in the high eights.

Patrick McDonnell also st5arsf_ '11
on the Orangeman’s team. - " i ‘

McDonnell, in a match against

L Cortland State, garnered two ,. .7.-if
firsts, (free exercise and parallel ~  ,
bars), two seconds (side horse and ; i
still rings), and two thirds (long 
horse vaulting and horizontal. ~

bars). -
Another noteworthy performer

for the Syracuse team is Tony. y_ 
DeStefano on the side horse. He V ‘

has been coming on strong as of

late, copping three consecutive 

first places against Cornell, Cort-
land and Army. *

Two more consistant Orange ,
performers are Gary Cushman and * “

Mark Guancial.

Cushman adds depth to the
free exercise team, taking places
in all but two meets. -

Guancial has added depth to -A ‘A 

the long horse team in much the

same way, by taking several pla,c-’— \

es and scoring well.

Pitt doesn’t have a man injured ‘ N 
on the team for the meet. They—~-*1‘.
have all the depth which they   
imagined they would have at the.-f Q,”

beginning of the season.
