Jarrell Wins by 108

Jarrell defeated AC foe Fred
Whittier by 108 ballots, 741 to 633.
Miss Capin led Sam Stahl, 751 to
565. Senior representative Zionts
was the only candidate on both
tickets.

President-elect Jarrell, who
will take oﬂice on April 2,
credited his campaign manager,
John Gooding, with much of his
success. ‘ ,

“I can attribute my victory to
a lot of hard work by the Pitt Ac-
tion Party whose driving force can
deﬁnitely be singled out in John
Gooding. John was able to rally
many hard workers to our cause
after starting from practically
nothing.” '

Jarrell Was ‘Doubtful’

J arrell admitted that he was
“doubtful” of his chancesfor vic-
tory just ‘before the polls closed.

Vvhittier, who was making a
bid for the top spot at the end
of his sophomore year, said_his
only immediate plans call for his
working on various committees.
He also said he plans to attend
most ofnext year’s SGA meet-
ings “as a student."

As for his running again next

‘year for president, Whittier said,

“This I can't say right now. I'd
probably like to, but it’s still a
year from now. If I am the best
qualiﬁed, I’ll, run.” .

Concerning his plans for SGA
J arrell said, “Our immediate plans
call for making internal changes

in SGA in order to strengthen our- -

selves from within before we at-
tempt to branch out into the gen-
eral problems of the student

down of thevoting last Wednes-

    an ill] Quiet  Election I-"rant

Elections are over.‘ Itwas quiet before the elections,

0 *duiet' during. the elections, and quiet the daytafter. The

vote was small; few were politically aware.
Nevertheless, the election transpired in a moderately

-. democratic manner with few exceptions, and in the opinion
_ of this newspaper, the best man won the presidency.

Clark Kentizlaritz, oops Kent Jarrell, “gentleman, «rec-

J. onteur, scholar,” as describedin the Pitt Gnus,-won the po-

sition. He now has a moredifﬁcult task ahead of him than if
he had been elected by 2500-3000 studerrts instead of the pid-
‘ dling 1387 who found time to go to the polls. ‘ - . p
\ For J arrell faces a continuing decrease in leadership tal-
‘ent and interest "at this University. In addition to this, the

followers, as evidenced by the voters in this election, are "

decreasing at much the same rate.
Withoutleaders and without the support of more than

A -a token few in the student body, Jarrell has the responsi-

bility of representing an unwilling student populace who

i 0,; care little whether SGA; exists or disappears. 

_ One ‘of the most interesting aspects of this. election i
that the women who were Voting swung the tide in favor -of

the PAP party and in favor- of ‘all. the women candidates I

for SGA. The University may be headed for rule by women
who comprise ‘less than a thirdiof the student body -if this
-may be accepted as a trend. New vice-president Lois Capin
polled more votes than president Jarrell,

' The women’s vote also explains why Men’s Council was
'taken' almost completely byathe‘Allied Collegiates, while
women do not vote for Men’s Council

Jarrell had the strength of his convictions to form the
new party, which successfully battled the ancient regime of
the Allied Collegia-tes to 'victory.- .

J The Allied Collegiates, on the other hand, have taken

-_ Tquiteua realistic viewpoint in not continuing the conﬂict
 past the election and promising to cooperate with winning

candidates. . ‘ .

J arrell in his administration must prove to the student '

, . body that SGA affects every student personally, that the

.'decisions and discussions of SGA are not merely training in

parliamentry. procerude and speech for people with nothing‘
' else to do. i -— . J i 

The new president must do everything in his power to

a 0 see that government is expressive of the will of the student
‘ body and is unafraid to stand up for its rights.

 -Exists Wirliauf 5...: 1 ..

Am,aizing\Mecha’nica|Bo:y

By Joe Ungar

Without a doubt, this is‘ the age of machines.
Machines of amazing‘ cleverness, and eﬁiciency that
prop us up on all sides and grant us “modern liv-
ing.” They start somewhere around th '
level and spread-out, becoming ’”
more and more elaborate and

   

less dials and blinking lights."
These calculators are particu-
larly impressive. In fact, demon-
strations and informative ﬁlm-
strips always feature ‘a technolo-
gist who stands at the control
panel with his sleeves rolled up
and says, “Yes, it’s almost htiman.”
‘ Of course, such a statement isﬂmeant to be a

gross exaggeration. And any serious thoughts of .
A the resemblancebetween‘ men and machines seem

extremely silly. Butnevertheless, your very close
relationship with mechanization‘ does, at times,
conﬁrm- itself with some uncanny events.

Take, for outstanding ‘example, the case ‘of

‘ Joey, “the mechanical boy,” asreported in this
month’s “Scientiﬁc American.” Because ,of an un-

favorable environment, Joey rejected humanity
and convinced himself thatihe was a machine.
His story’ started w,ith_f1 emotionally immature
parents, a father whose prime concern lay in’ Air
‘Force activities and'a mother who had been disap-

pointed by her "pregnancy. Thus, » as an infant,‘

Joey was regarded withviﬂridiiferencei
Rigid ‘Four-hour Schedule

-His mother gave him only as much time as his
physical processes‘ demanded. Regardless of how
often he cried,‘_he was fed on a rigid four-h‘our
schedule. No one ever cuddled or even played with
him. At night, his father entered the scene to pun-
ish him for his whimperings. ‘

This neglect and maltreatment, ‘however, did‘

not stunt Joey’s'cu/riosity, for at an early age..‘he
developed an intense interest in"-machinery.
Although ‘the interest ‘grew into an unnatural
preoccupation, little ‘was done to alter it, and at
the age of seven he entered parochial school. Here
‘he rapidly succeeded in converting himself into
the easiest thing, he could become—a- mechanical
boy. i V .
_ He achieved this state by constructing imple-
ments, both «actual and imaginary, which entered
into his bodily activities and eventually controlled

Why.C-o to Broadway?

  

 

them. His ﬁrst, a complex piping system built of
straws, served as a “pump” enabling him to drink

. water.

Then he devised some exhaust pipes to carry
away. the “fumes” when he exhaled. With mask-
ing tape, wire, and cardboard, he built a gadget
analogous to a battery charger to “live him” .whil .
he slept. ‘
No Oil for Joey I -

One d_ay-(wonder‘ of wonders) someone-realized
that_Joey was not acting normally and advised
his, parents to seek‘ special treatment. He was
placed in the Sonia Shankman Orthogenic School
at the University of Chicago. During early care
under trained hands, the extent of his delusion be-
came apparent. He did everything except drink oil.

Upon entering the dining hall, he would string

an invisible cord to the wall outlet and plug him-

self in. And then he. would‘line his chair with
paper napkins for insu~lati'on.‘He had conjured up
an electrical digestivegsystem. ’ "

_ Many times a dayhe would, so to speak, ex-
plode. That is, heiwould suddenly “turn himself
on,”'give the semblance of shifting into higher and
higher gears as he correspondingly screamed and‘
jumped ‘about, until, shopting “Crash, crash,” he\
would break some nearby object and subside to
motionless silence. _ "
Rocks While Bathing —

"When addressed, he replied “Bam”; when bath-

.ed he rocked back and forth like an idling motor.

But the ‘transformation was not "complete, for even
though Joey lived in an isolated mechanical world,

. heihad a tendency to endow his surroundings with ‘

human traits. . _
’- He gave proper.names to cardboard boxes and
radioitubes, and he ‘believed that they sometimes
got sick and that they bled if injured. ,
.'In addition, one of his devices, “the criticizer,”
was probably the counterpart of a grandmother. It
prevented him from saying unpleasant words. So,

in. short, Joey had not been .hopelessly lost, and ~
by the time he was 12 the Institute had reinstated

him as a human being.

Obviously, much ‘can be learned from this epi-
sode. In the words of Bruno Bettelheim, author of
the original article, “it reminds us that the human
body can operate without a human spirit . . . that
the body can exist without a soul.” Also, according
to Bettelheim, “it sheds light on emotional de-
velopment iii a mechanized society.” Also, it is
frightening.

Pitt Players have served up a

tasty‘ stew in “Guys and Dolls.” ~

The sets and choreography
were the most outstanding fea-
tures of the musical, but “give
you 8-5” the.
acting was‘ not  —
far behind.
Players spent
large amounts
of money and
larger amounts,
of time on
t h e i r s.e ts
which are the
m os t realistic
and effective
that this writer
has seen in - T
‘ four years of Pitt Players going.
The chorus line was superior
in almost every way. Particular-
is ly impressive was the Cuban
dance which reached a height-of
..'feveris1{ intensity. Occasionally,

- this chorus line seemed slightly

uncoordinated although the in-
dividual dancers "obviously were
- good. This seemed to be ‘a fail-

ure on the part of the orchestra, ,

a comparative weak spot in the
production. ‘ A ,
Dqniry Ouistainding Irishman

Perhaps the outstanding act-
ing job was done in one of‘ the
minor roles, the .Irish grandfa-
ther, Arvide Abernathy, played
by Jay Dantry. Helived the part
on the stage and was very well-
received -by the Tuesday eve-
ning critics and faculty audience
The song “More I Cannot Wish
You” ‘was emotionally gratify-

- ing. ‘ _ A
Rena Gorn ‘was extremely

_ /capable inethe role of Miss Ade-

Q laide. VI-lei‘ presentation, of the
‘song: ‘.‘A_delaide’s Lamgn

 

”‘ In re»

widely known as “A Person Can
Develop a Cold,” was effective
and very amusing._ Her song and

dance routines with the Hot Box‘

girls were professional in qual-
ity. The intonation. and pathetic
' quality in the speaking parts of
Miss Arelaide were well-hand-
led.

Gil Lazier gave a good rendi-
tion of Sky. Masterson, although
at times overacting was evident.
His singing voice is pleasing and
‘suited to the role. He showed
stage -presence and_ability, par-
ticularly noteworthy in “Luck
Be a Lady.” .

Carol Smart’s (Sarah Brown)
voice was a pleasure to hear.

' Her acting at the outset seemed
too -stiff even for the‘ mission
girl” she was playing, but as

_ the play progressed, she seem-
ed to loosen up. ’

The drunk scene in Havana
was good, the emotional inter-
play -between 'Masterson and-
Sarah masterful. The expressive
line in answer to Masterson’s
question of “what the hell” kind
of girl she was, “I’m a mission
girl” was exceptionally effective.

Wiﬂicisms Passed Over

Barry ‘Tarshis as Nathan De- I

troit was competent, but seemed
to lack some" of the luster and
bombast required for the role.
One general criticism which ap‘-
plies to Tarshis, but also to
other members of the cast was
that they failed to use the wit-
ticisms topthe best effect. They

. were passed over before the
audience had a. chance to com- ‘

prehend or, respond.

Karen Parker played a won-
derful General Matilda B. Cart-if
'wright. She showed a “holier
than thou” attitude perfectly
appropriate. Marshall ' Hoffman,
Big Jule (“I came here to shoot
crap”), played the dumb hood
well. ‘

The music, as mentioned earl-
ier,.detracted from the worth of
play, although the individual
musicians are certainly compe-
tent. Perhaps, lack of sufficient,
practice with the players was to
blame.

Faculty members who have
seen all the-Players productions
for many years wereecstatic in
their praise of this musical, and
with much. justiﬁcation. As one
said, “Why go to Broadway?”

STRIKE UP THE BAND!

Shine up your dancing shoes and oil your kneecaps, for the
coolest, swingin’est band in the land‘ is coming your way. I
refer, of course, to Ralph Ma.rt-erie and his Marlboro Men.
Ralph, as he is'a.iiect-iona.tely called, "hasvbeen ringing the
bell all over the country with his records and personal appear-
ances, and I know you will all want to be ready for Ralph, as

he is jocularly referred to, when he hits your campus. This"

mezmsyou must know all the lyrics to the songs Ralph, as he
is drolly yclept, will be playing, for there is nothing more
pleasing to your dancing partner than singing loudly in his
car during a number. , A .

In case you should forget all the lyrics, don't bedull about it:
I mean, don’t just sing drab old syllables like la, la, la or dum
do dum. Pick more interesting syllables—like slimp gans or
It:-retch din.-kle or V mlath rolce. Say, for instance, ’ that Ralph,
as he is hoydenishly designated, is playing That. Old Black M agic
and you can’t recall all the lyrics. Try singing this:

‘That old /cretch dirzkle

Has me in its mint/a

That old kretch div/(Isle

That I slimp so guns

Those icy dinlclcs

Rumzing dowrt m 1/ siimp

That‘ old lrretch d27n/dc

W/Len your roke means n1:'z'ne . . . etc.
Interesting? What did I tell you?

 

Another way. to please your p-.»u't»ner while you dance  to tell
him interesting facts about the composers whose songs Ralph,
as he is impishly termed, will be playing. For instance:

1. Irving Berlin’s name spelled backuvvrwds  Gnivri Nilreb.

2. Rodgers and Hammerstein can only write music while
whitewashing a fence. . _ ‘

 , _3-. One of our greatest songs,,wa_s.writ-ten because the wife of

caiitalotipe and :1 dog named Lassie. “Why did you bring home

3 '8.‘ icaritaloupe" and la/"dog" named ‘Lassie?” "said the composer.
 .“For the baby,” replied the wife. The composer grew furious.
- .‘.‘Here we "are ﬂat broke,” he cried, “and you come home with
,2a melon fo1':.the baby, acollie for the.ba.by!” Then, suddenly
_ struck wi.th.an,inspiration,, he rushed to the piano and wrote

Season Less Than «Two Weeks Away

Three Pitchers Develop Sore Arms

Hamilton, Guthrie '°

Only Able Hurlers

By TED COLTON

. With the baseball season
scheduled to open in less than
two weeks Coach Bobby Lew-
is has run into s-erious trouble
even before the squad has had
"a chance to work out on a reg-_

ular diamond.
The team has been going through

and three of the front-line pitch-
ers have come up with sore arms.
Bob Conti,,John Reichenbach and
Dick Wirth, all lettermen from
last year, have reported sore arms
to Lewis. _

The three boys posted a com-
bined record last year of ,7-3
and are being counted on heav-
ily this year to form a strong
pitching staff for the Panthers.

With the thre boys being treated 

by_a doctor, Lewis will have to
depend on Bill Hamilton and
Lauren Guthrie to do the bulk of
the Panthers’ pitching. Jim Walsh
and Dick Wisniewski are also
available for duty. ,
Lewis expects his inﬁeld to car-
ry the load if the pitchers are not

better by the opener. “We have .

lots of experience in the inﬁeld,”
he stated. ‘

“With three lettermen return-
ing and two boys who did not
receive letters last year but saw
a lot of action in Bill Martin and
Herm Joy, we ought to be all
right there.”

The Panthers open the season
April 2 against the Quantico Ma-
ries at Quantico. The contest is
scheduled as an exhibition. _

April 3 they will travel ‘to Char-
lottesville where they will meet
Virginia, and the next day they
will move to Georgetown. for a
contest with Georgetown College.

GERALD A. PARSONS received his B.A. in
. 1950 and. his M.B.A. one year later, both
from Cornell University. He joined General
Electric in 1954 and is presently Specialist-
Marketing Administration in the company’s
Large Steam Turbine-Generator Department.

“The biggest challenge
a man has to face is himself”

’“Men and businesses are alike in one respect,” says
Gerald A. Parsons, 30-year-old marketing and per-
sonnel development specialist. “Their success de-
pends to a great extent on how well they respond to
challenge. And I’ve found that the biggest challenge
a man has to face on his job ‘is not the competition of
others — but the far more important one of develop-
ing himself to his fullest capabilities.

“During my four years with General Electric,
I’~ve had plenty of opportunity for self—development.
Challenging training assignments at ﬁve different

locations within the. company have given me a

broader understanding of "my career area. In my
present job I have the beneﬁt of working with ex-
perts, both in establishing long—range goals ‘and in
helping to achieve them. I’ve found that working
towardfuture potential is vital in, the development
of successful businesses and successful men.”

     

Young men such as.Gerry Parsons are important
to the future of companies like General‘ Electric and
to the growth of America’s dynamic, competitive-
enterprise economy. Our nation-’s progress will de-
pend more and more upon those forward-looking
individuals who continue to develop to their fullest
capabilities during their lifetime.

That is why General Electric provides a climate
for individual progress ——- with opportunity for in-
creasing knowledge and skil1s—for all of its em-
ployees, including 30,000 college graduates. For it
is only as "individuals meet the challenge of self-
development that there continues» to be progress for
a business, an industry, or a nation.

‘ ' 1 It started out as a friendly chat about Pitt's baseball prospects
.- -for this season, but before many minutes had~elapsed Panther Coach
Bobby Lewis was talking about some of the problems that Pitt base-
‘ball faces now and will facewin -the near future. E
, Among, these problems is the coming of the trimester plan, which
will be implemented here next September. Bobby, who is beginning
hisﬁftli season as the Panthers’ head baseball coach, seemed a little
 -disappointed at the idea of the trimester’s making its appearance
‘ now. “We’re progressing,” he began. “We’re starting to. build up, but
now I don’t know what. will happen.’
Lewis has been connected with" Pitt baseball, in some manner
for all butgtwo of the past 11 years. He .was the starting center
ﬁelder ‘i:'or_ the late Ra/lph Mitterling in_1949,__’50 and5”51, ‘haying _
_' ‘his best yearcas a junior with a .390 batting ayerage; _ T ,1 ‘_
_- After serving ‘two’ years in the Marine Corps, he returned to
Pitt to-work for his Master’s degree. But, in 1954, his former coach
suffered yalstroke and Lewis was asked to take temporary ‘charge of
the mitters. I-Iisjob became‘ a permanent one ' ’ " “
the next yearwhen Mitterlingdied. i

=1: =l'-' =l=__

    

~ Bobby sees many diﬂiculties that the ‘new
system will present‘. “The second trimester
will end right in the middle of our season,” he
"complained. “We ’can’t schedule any games
‘during ﬁnals week, so that kn'ocks another
week out of ‘ourschedule possibilities.

“They said cg’ ’d be able toplay all the
'way through t e third trimester. But who
are we ging to play? Everyone else is ﬁn-

,‘ ished by June 1._ g ‘ ,_‘ BOB LEWIs_
f‘It‘s also possible’ that we could lose a great portipn of our teamx
g right in the middle of the season. Boys will probably graduate after
eight or ten games.’ Why, we could win the ﬁrst ten games and then
lQse.the next ten. _ 1 E . ’ _ l _
“We would have to ﬁnd out from the NCAA whether. a boy. could
ﬁnish out the season even if /he‘ has completed his academic Work.
It Works lie that for someone, say a ‘track man, who ﬁnishes school
by J une. 1. He can still enter a ‘championship meet, say, on June 13.”
Lewis all but discounted the idea of ha‘vingva.“boy stay out of
school for thenfirst trimester, from September to December. “How
many boyswould like to sit out‘ the ﬁrst one?” he asked. “It’s
pretty hard to tell a kid to sit_ that one out. ' '
“A lot of things go on during that time in school, especially so-
, cially. And anyway, a boy who needs money for school probably
woudn’t be able to get a fulltime job at that time.” - ‘
Lewis will have another year to worry about the matter and
T maybe arrive at" a solution that right now seems non’-existent. He
will be hit by the graduation-in-the-middle-of-the-season problem
_n_ext April when ‘the players who -are juniors now will leave. ‘
