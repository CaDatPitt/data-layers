. Inaugurate

_ Study Plan

- By JUDY_GOTTERER
Approximately f85 en t e ring
freshmen will take part in Pitt’s
new program of core curriculum,
four basic courses designed to
provideea broader base of gener-
al education upon which young
’men and women can build their
careers‘.

Students, selected on the basis
of their orientation test scores,
—were sent letters askingwthem to
come to the University for an
interview so that actual partici-
pation in the eight pilot sections
is voluntary. 7

 .The group was chosen on th
basis of a comparison with fresh-
men of September 1954, ranging
from the best to the lowest stu-
dent. The quota of men and

_ women in the class will followa
ration of approximately 2-1’ to
furthe'r.,insure a true cross sec-

’; tion.of the class. _ V

Students chosen were from,A,
Bi and Pre-Law groups in Col-
lege, eliminating all other pref
"professional groups. Participants
must be College liberal arts stu-
dents. , '

Will Receive Scholarships

Those participating will receive
.ha1f tuition scholarships for core
‘curriculum credits. This plan
.,rna_kes it possible for the commit-
tee choosing the students to be
selective, enabling them to ac-
cept or reject students.»'Each
student will’ take at least two
and not more than three of the
four courses offered, to prevent
their becoming a group apart
from the other freshmen.

Ttfere will be eight pilot sec-
_ -tions, two of each of.the four
areas—-Written and Spoken Eng-
- lish; The Humanities; The Social

Sciences; The Natural Sciences.

Tuition aid was made available
through a $175,000 grant pre-
sented last February to .the,un—

Federal Govit
Offers Money

I . ,
For New UHIOH
By BARBARA CHERINGTON
,Although the Federal Housing
and Home Finance Agency has
recently announced Pitt’s eligi-
bility for a loan of $2,700,000,’
ofﬁcials expressed doubt as to
whether the Universitygwill turn
to federal aid for its planned
Student Union. Original contacts
were made through David Walk-
er, head of the Philadelphia na-

tional office.

Up until now negotiations 5
have been made only with pri-*
vate agencies.

Final decisions, however,
rest with the Pitt Board of
trustees who will meet inoc-
tober. -

Over the. past three months,
Dean Biddle said, “we’ve been
moving, ahead with confidence
‘thatmoney would be available
and we made preliminary ap-
plication for loans.” '

Eligibility Determined

b Although Pitt has de.prelim-
inary application for a general‘:
loan for “the union,” the applica-

tion was ﬁled‘ merely to deter-

min e ‘eligibility for federal

money.

Nevertheless the dean stat-

that both government and com-
mercial lending interests have
indicated an interest in lending
us money to _build dormitories

J b world’s

and a student union.”

‘Omnibus’ This Week

Omnibus, Pitt’s student magazine, will hit the stands
this week. Due to be published Tuesday or Wednesday,
the new issue will feature a variety of subjects, with foot-

ball as its keynote.

The magazine, ﬁrst of its kind here since‘ the Pitt
-Panther, had its initial publication last May. This trial
issue proved successful and approval was granted for six

issues during this school year. ¢

To kick off the football sea-
son, an article, “Michelosen and
Company,” will give a preview
of Pitt’s new coach, Johnny
Michelosen, and his chances with
the 1955 squad. In addition to
this article, KDKA’s Tom Bender
gives his predictions of the top
20 football teams in the nation.

Pitt’s«football queen, Collette
Mullen, is featured in an article
entitled, “What is Football With-
out‘ Beauty.” Collette, incident-
ally, is the cover girl of this
Omnibus issue. .

Don Gartner, “S Award” win-
ner last spring wrote a story on
his summer trip to Europe en-
titled, “International Report to
Pitt.”

Humor is not left out of the
Omnibus this issue either. Ster-
ling Yates, KDKA‘ disk jockey,
wrote an article on music, and a
satire on bachelor life is given
/in “Field Guide for Bachelors.”
A humorous article on basketball
is given in “The Blackboard

Jungle Panther.” Short jokes are '
- featured in “Omnibus Skyscrap-

per’)! K
Back on the serious side, Judy
-Gotterer discusses ’ the much-

 

talked—about core curriculum.
Fraternities are given 'an in-side
look in an article by Gordon
Clow‘ney, and Omnibus fashion
editor, LaVerne Dunten, discusses
an important subject to many
co-eds, “Back ot School—What
to Wear?”

Fiction Editor of the magazine,
Don Miller, has come up_w_ith a
story entitled “The Jet Caesar.”
This is a story of a modern-age
motorcycle fanatic who is guided
by a Marlon Brando movie.

This issue, which will go on
sale at the Student Desk at 25

cents per copy, will mark the’

editorial debut of Paul Harrison,
Managing Editor of V the Pitt
News. Harrison plans the re-
mainder of the issues to be pub-
lished in October, December,
February, April, and May.

Players pen Year
With ‘Bernardine’
At Stephen Foster

Michael McHale, director of
,Pitt Players, announced that the
'Players’ first show of the new
season will be “Bernardine” by
Mary Chase, author of “Harvey.”

McHale described the comedy
as ideal for college actors and

audiences since it is about real
teen‘-agers and their relations
with grown ups.

The main characters, seven or
eight youths, are similar to Dead
End Kids. The plot revolves
around the youth’s dreaming up
an ideal woman who comes from
Sneaky Falls where the only
word spoken is “yes”.

The play, which will be
presented at Stephen Foster
Memorial, November 26, 27, and
28," is done with little or no
scenery on a bare stage. This
will make it possible for Players
.to tour this show in and around
the Pittsburgh area. '

Tryouts for “Bernardine” will
be held the Week of Oct. 10.

Other plays being ,,co’nsl'dered
for the season are “Brigadoon,”
“Mr. Roberts," ‘ “My Three
Angels,” “Pygmalion,” a n d

‘_‘Madwoman of Chaillot.”

there will be enough people in
Pittsburgh to meet those require-
ments,” Dr. Litchﬁeld s'aid. He
also said that Pitt must gear
itself to be an institution that
can insure everyone a “genuine
liberal education” plus profes-
sional training.

’ “I think it means that the
‘time has come where we can

no longer think of a college ed-
ucation in just four years,” he

concluded. ,

The new Chancellor is a 1936
graduate ‘of the University of
Michigan, and_ received his doc-
tor of philosophy degree from
Michigan in 1940. He is a mem-
ber of ‘the American Political

American Society for. Public

Dr. Litchﬁeld formerly served
as director of civil affairs f6r the
U.S. Military Government in
Germany and as a consultant to
t h e Under-Secretary of the,

In an ‘exclusive interview with the Pitt NEWS
today, Colonel Beauregard J. (for julep) Cornpone,

The Colonel, who until recently was a member

The men and women, allhmembers of'the—"college of

create a situation paralleling the true. University ratio.

During the next two years, the students will study
four basic “core courses.” designed to introduce them to
all facets of terminology and general ideas conducted

. in the humanities, social sciences, communications, and

stacks of curricula outlines which are neatly piled in the
new Core Curriculum office, they’ll cover a lot of ground

From earliest indications, the program -~w’ill be a

‘ __.cally during lastsemester, only two “cores” were to be
attempted the ﬁrst year——humanities and social sciences.

After reading both courses, committee meinbers and

V luniversity oﬁicials were j apparently enthused ‘enough
’ »about what they had seen to ‘speed up initial prepara-

tion for the other programs. ‘Although assuredly nothing

rash was done, the much-warranted plan is_oﬂ:' to“"a_

good beginning; ' I

These courses will accomplish two very important

aspects of freshman life once they are approved, edited,

, and instated as permanent needs if‘ the_y'prove tobe

worth all the effort. Besides providing the entering
student with exceptional instructors and a general grasp

-of information, it will mean a concrete program which
the ﬂoundering freshman cannot now find. for himself

as he enters within the Gothic walls. _
The student may as well know also that his “core”

’ teacher will also be learning along with him’... Up to
' .now, most instructors have specialized in stated sub-
jetcs; the change gives them the opportunity to broaden

academic endeavor ‘more’so than they are‘ able to do

' while handling speciﬁc courses.

It was understood last year, in discussion with‘ core
officials, that very few persons hav the knowledge to
be proﬁcient in all aspects of the particular “core” which
they might teach. They’ll be instructed in some phases
before they approach the class with -them.

So, it might well seem that discussion from both
the lectern and the front seats will prove‘ to be unusually

interesting. _ .

The pendulum has swung far to the other
extreme. In many institutions unqualiﬁed athletes

preference over students ‘interested in study, yet
unable to afford college education. Ours is no

A Modern.

By Jack Olender
Like the children of Israel

the pathway that was miracu-
lously ' hewn across the -Red
Sea, we of the "modern-day
world have embarked on a
journey of. no return — the

_ Ever, since'that August day

Atomic bomb . . .” the peoples
of the world have lived in fear.
Owes No Allegiance ,
Although this country was
the ﬁrst to harness the power
of atomic energy, the atom is,
as Gordon Dean, former chair-

man of . the United States
Atomic Energy Commission,
labeled it, “the international

atom”. It pledges allegiance to
no ﬂag; it obeys only one set
of laws--the laws of physics.
Its awful_ power can be chan-
neled into constructive" or
destructive uses. The tension
that now envelopes the world
has’? made the latter purpose
the dominant one.

.Word came from London
recently that both Soviet and
Western members of the United
Nations. Disarmament Commit-
tee meeting there have sub-
mitted proposals that would
limit certain types of arma-

‘ ments, excluding atomic weap-
ons. Such proposals are only
steps in the right direction.‘

"But the ideals are high.‘ And the average
student is far from the realms of cloud-walking.
He’ll still-grab a beer with his‘ buddies for an
extra hour ‘or two; or hang around -band practice
while French vocabulary remains "a nonentity;
he”l1 loll around the Pitt Newsioﬁice waiting to

take up the time of actual participation, but they
serve somehow as lodestones for want of ‘some’-'
thing to do when ‘the [books appear tooominous.

That’s one of their great dangers, I feel——that
inexplicable'attr.action which takes up so much‘
time which could be better spent‘with the books.

But when this columnist ﬁrst came to Pitt,
someone told him to pick up two and no» more
than three activitiesand stick with them all-the
way. through. That way they’l1 beneﬁt the'most.

Sovereignty Modified

Even this will be very diffi-
cult to attain. -To.c1-eate a
supra-national ‘ organ for
purpose of ‘regulating and/or
eliminating the production of
atomic weapons is to’great1y

modify the nation-state system‘

with all its claims to sovereign-
ty. Each state is supposedly the
master ‘of its fate. Each ap-
portionment of sovereignty to

an‘ international agency is a
foundation for closer world
federation. ‘

In the present U.N. setup,

some concessions of sovereignty
have been made, but nothing of
any signiﬁcance. The _ veto
power that plagues the Secur-
ity-Council can block any ap-
peal for concerted action.

The U.S.S.R. has continually
refused to sacriﬁce that amount
of sovereignty necessary to,’
make an international control"
agency effective. She refused

the Baruch proposal of 1945

and went ahead developing her
own atomic arsenal.

Secret Stores -

A Granted, the practicality of
operating an autonomous con-

trol agency can be questioned. ‘

No amount of spying is going
to prevent’ a country from
secretly storing away some nu-
clear weapons “just in case.”
The ideals of the Eisen-
hower—sponsored atomic secrets
plan has been scoffed at by the
Russians and most countries
that recognize the weaknesses
of a rash solution. But it has
set at least the tone for future
proposals which will

Mellon Educational and Chari-
ties Trust.

To Provide Intellectual Skill

The four basic courses are de-
signed to provide the undergrad-
uate student with greatei intel-
lectual skills, to improve the
quality of his judgments, and to
increase his knowledge concern-
ing the methods of science and
his understanding of man and
human existence.

The integrated course in
writing, speaking, reading, and
listening’ aims to give the stu-
dent a reasonable awareness of
language as a means of com-
munication. ,

The work of the.course will
center around the control of
grammatical and rhetorical pat-
terns of English sentences, writ-

‘ten and spoken, of the various
means of rhetorical organization

in writing and speaking and 01-

special techiques that will aid in
other University courses.

Understanding Man Important

To start the student on his way
towards understanding the na-
ture of man and human existence
is the aim of the humanities
course. Data to be considered and
dealt with will include written
,materials (imaginative litera-
ture, philosophy, history, religi-
ous writings), music, and fine
arts ( a r c h itecture, sculpture,
painting).

The basic course in social
sciences will demonstrate the
interaction of thg individual
on society and society on the
individual by identifying the
values and conﬂicts in modern
society with a theme kind of

approach.

The objective of the Natural
Sciences course, is to give the
student an understanding of that
intellectual activity which is the
distinguishing feature and driv-

' ing force of natural science. To:

achieve this purpose the course
will treat subject matter from
the major fields of science.

Each of the ﬁve sections of the V
course—Evo1ution of Earth and

Life; Celestial Motions; Atomic
Nature of Matter‘;
Cell; The Behavior
Living O1-ganisms—will present

an important scientiﬁc theory, or?

closely—knit group of theories. 

In each the treatment will fol-

theory was built,.then.the de-,_
velopment of the theory itself,’
and finally some of its conse- 

quences and ‘applications. .

‘(Quarterback Albright

If he’s all right, Eddie Albright may very well be the
chap who could cause the fans to stand up and take note
of himself and his teammates this year.

Monmouth, however, did not

was slightly hysterical and left

Panthers Must
Avoid Mistakes

By GENE ARONIATORIO

  

Sports Editor

In trying to dope out What the Pitt football team will
do in the won-lost column this year, we can’t completely
forget.Patrick Henry’s observation that “The only way to
judge the future is but by the past.”

This applies to some extent in- just about everything-
including football. But, how then do we evaluate a foot-
ball team with two pasts; which is precisely what Pitt has.

There was the time of several decades ago when Pitt was
one of the top powers of the nation in football and more
recently there was the period of grid decay which made Pitt
a football patsy. ‘

Now we’re in _a time of football resurgence which has put
Pitt backin the big-time football league right alongside thebest
teams in the country. If there are .any doubts, of this; a glance
at theschedule should dispell them. Pitt has gained a reputation
in the past two years of having just about the toughest schedule
ofany team in the country. ' '

Many Panther fans expected great things from last year's

,_eleven and they were very much disappointed with the outcome

--especially in the ﬁrst few games. The Pitt rooters had placed
all faith and conﬁdence in a team which had three sophomores
in the starting backﬁeld and another on the line.

Granted that these. _sophs comprised "the best crop of
gridders to graduate from the freshman class. Yet with these
sophs leading the way into what was billed .as the greatest
schedule ever, observers felt that the big year was at hand.

Starting off against such powers as Southern Cal, Minnesota,
and Notre Dame, however, was a pretty tough way for the new-
comers to break in and they showed it. As Red Dawson said
after the Notre’ Dame clash, “We’ve just run into too much too
early. ‘We’re still a good team,". he added. And the Panthers
proved ‘this by winning four of their last six starts.

On the basis of this past then, how do prospects look. for a
‘good season this year? Again the Panthers start off in fast com-
pany by opening with California and following with Syracuse
and Oklahoma,‘ Though both Cal and Syracuse are strong, they’re
not quite the same caliber as either Southern Cal and Minne-
sota. Between NotreiDame and Oklahoma;it’s, a toss—up.,

,It’s also a toss-up when the personnel of last year’s squad
is compared with that of the present squad. Naturally, the
big loss was the graduation of Lou Palatella, Eldred Kraemer,
and Henry Ford.

The other fact. to note is that those highly-touted sophs of
last year have had avyear of experience—that unteachable some-
thing. ’ _

As sophs last year they were expected to make mistakes and
they did; plenty of them. There were 34 pass completions
and 16 interceptions; the Panthers were penalized a total of 548

yards in the nine games, and had 32 fumbles! There were doubt-

less other mistakes made that aren’t included in the statistics.
These are the mistakes that were expected to be made
although it’s doubtful if’ .quite that many, were expected.
This year with more experience. throughout the ﬁrst team
‘and entire squad, there shouldn’t be so many mistakes—there
must not be if the Panthers expect toiwin. .
In a recent magazine article, Oklahoma coach Bud .Wilkinson
mentions this very topic of mistakes. He observed that, “In

- football most teams defeat themselves. If we never get a penal-

ty, if we never get a pass" intercepted, if we never fumble and
always try to execute our assignments. we’ll probably win . . .
An intercepted pass will defeat you right now. It has a shock
element.” .

These are the mistakes that John Michelosen’s gridders must
avoid if they hope to have a winning season. .-Against Cali-
fornia these mistakes were committeed time after time. Pitt
fumbled eight times and lost the ball ﬁve of those times!
The Panthers did manage to. win by playing a tremendous
final quarter but they won in spite of the mistakes, not be-
cause they didn‘t make any.

If that many ‘mistakes had been made against a really good

team, Oklahoma or ’West Virginia for instance, the Panthers would
have been out of the running by halftime. '

ONCE MoRE UNTO THE BREACH .

Today I begin my second year of writing this column for

Philip Morris Cigarettes. Once every week during the.coming 

school year I will take up, without fear or favor, issues that
inﬂame the minds and quicken the hearts of college students .,
everywhere. I will grapple with such knotty questions as: “Is ,
compulsory attendance the reﬂection of an insecure faculty?”-
and “Is the unmarried student obsolete?” and “Are room-mates
sanitary?” ' ' I —

_ While each week I make a bold assault uponzthese burning
issues, I will also attempt to beguile you into smoking Philip
Morris Cigarettes. Into each column I will craftily weave some

_ . _ ' . words in praise of Philip
Ivuﬂ 6,-apple wit ~ Morris. I will extol, _ob-" .

,  V ' liquely, the benign mild-

        
   

ness of Philip Moi-i'is’s
Well-born tobacco, its -V
soothing fragrance, its
tonic freshness, its docile
temperateness, its oh-so-
welcome gentleness in this
spiky and abrasive world-
ofours;

For saying these kind —

things about their ciga-\
rettes, the’ Philip Morris
Company will pay me
 _ money. This is the Ameri-
" V '    " - . -- » can Way. This is De-
. mocracy. This is Enlight-
Gudz 35‘ ened Self Interest. This
. is the System that Made
Our Country Great, and anybody
MALADJUSTED. 3

‘Perhaps it would be well in this ﬁrst column of the .y'ear_to ’
tell you a. little about myself. I am 36 ‘years of age, but still.

remarkably active. I am squat, moon-faced, have all my teeth, ~ H j;_.-

and am fond of folk dancing and Lotto. My hobby is collecting
mucilage. ‘

I ﬁrst took up writing because I was too short to steal. Bare-
foot Boy With Cheek was my maiden effort, and today,,fourteen
years. later, I continue to .
write about college students.
This is called “arrested de- W, W”
velopment. .

But I can't help it.
Though I am now -in the
winter of my life, the prob-
lems of undergraduates still
seem to me as pressing.as
ever. How‘ to pursue,a blag-
ing romance with exams
coming up next Friday in
physics, ‘history and French ;
how to convince your stingy
father that life is a bitter
mockery without a yellow
convertible; how to subsist
on dormitory food — these
remain the topics that roil
my sluggish blood.

And in ‘this column _from now until next June you will read
of such things: of ‘dating and pinning, of fraternities and sorori-
ties and independents, of cutti_ng and cramming, of athletes and
average-raisers, of extra-and intra-curriculum, of textbooks and
those who write them and those who sell them and those who
read them and those who don't.

And, slyly woven ‘into’ this stirring tapestry, the story of
Philip Morris, America's gentle cigarette, in the handy Snap-
Open pack, in king-size or regular, at prices all can afford.
