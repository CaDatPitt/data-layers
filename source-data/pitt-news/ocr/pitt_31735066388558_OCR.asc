UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Byjennifer Calabrese
Editor in Chief

After months of controversy surrounding
Pitt’s administration, the Board of Trustees
took action to begin rebuilding the
university’s reputation and the morale of
the Pitt community.

“A great anguish, frustration, irritation
and tension permeates the campus. We do
have problems. I am painfully aware of
that,” said BOT chairperson John Marous
at a board meeting Thursday. “The old

adage is that you must have an emotional
experience to make a cultural change.”

Among other things, the trustees did the
following:

-Formed a seven—member com-
pensation committee that will publicly
determine the salaries of the university
president and other administrators.

-Voted to restore more than $230,000 to
the university’s libraries. In 1988, the money
was diverted to fund low-interest
mortgages for Pitt administrators.

-Announced that Pitt is currently seeking

The reforms came after reports of a $3.5
million retirement package for outgoing
President Wesley Posvar and alleged
misuses of university funds by Pitt officials.
Posvar’s retirement package was created
by a small committee of trustees in 1974
and not made public until recently.

During the three—hour meeting attended
by more than 300 people, Posvar delivered
a farewell speech.

Board of Trustees begin university ’s reforms

Posvar’s address made no mention of

the recent controversies surrounding the “

university. Instead, he focused on the
university’s future in the new age of “global
interdependence.” Posvar urged the univ-
ersity to move forward and to continue
Pitt’s tradition of international leadership.
After Posvar asked his wife, Mildred, to
stand, he said, “Between the two of us we
have given you 48 years of service.”
Posvar’s departure from the meeting was
followed by strong criticism from invited

Pitt’s leading fund-raiser has
decided to leave the university
to accept a similar position with
Case Western Reserve University
in Ohio.

Bruce A. Loessin, Pitt’s vice
president for university relations
and development for the last six
years, said he is pursuing the
Case opportunity because the
offer was just too good to pass
up.

“Case Western is a very hot
university right now,” said
Loessin. “It’s a very selective
university that’s doing really
well.”

As vice president for alumni
‘affairs and development at Case,

Loessin will receive an increase
over his present salary of
$125,000. He will also acquire a
development staff nearly double
the size of his current team.

Loessin said Case has just
launched a $350 million fund-

raising campaign, one of the

largest in the country. He
compared it to Pitt’s current $225
million, 5-year capital campaign,
which last year generated a
record $36.4 million in private
donations alone.

Since 1985, Loessin said Pitt’s
private donations soared from
$13 million to well over twice
that figure. He said President
Wesley Posvar’s support of the
program has been instrumental.

Loessin said private
contributions have been down

somewhat compared to last year,
but he attributed this more to the
recession and the Persian Gulf
war than to a lack of support for
the university. Loessin said -he
does not think recent disclosures
in the media of alleged ﬁnancial
mismanagement within the
university have seriously
damaged private donations.
“The people that send money
to Pitt are loyal to Pitt," he said.
“They’re not going to stop
[donating] because of the
publicity." Some contributors
have increased their donations,
according to Loessin.

Loessin said he was proud of ‘

Pitt’s development and
communications program. Last
year, Pitt won an award from
Ford Motor Company for the best

advancement program in the - 

country. The previous year, Pitt
won a similar award from U.S.
Steel. Loessin said he thought
the awards weren't meant to be
taken literally, but that they
represent recognition for vast
improvement in a program given
its individual situation. He said
Pitt magazine, one of the projects
handled by his department, has
been rated among the Top 10
alumni magazines by “just about
everybody.” ’
Loessin has not set a definite
date for his departure from the
university, but he will assume
his duties at Case this fall. Loessin
told Pitt President—elect J. Dennis
O’Connor he would help his still-
unnamed successor with the
transition process, if necessary.

Although both Presbyterian University
Hospital, a part of the University of Pittsburgh
Medical Center, and Pitt made offers to buy
the Syria Mosque, a bidding war between the
two institutions did not occur, according to
mosque and university officials.

Norman Arbes, chief potentate of Syria
Temple Holding Corporation, said at least
four offers for the mosque were considered:

‘ Pitt, the Oakland-based National Development

Corporation, Presby and a sheik who wanted
to convert the building into a house of worship.

9 After Pitt's bid was rejected, Syria,Temple
agreed to sell the mosque to NDC for $10
million, according to Arbes. When NDC
announced its anchor tenant was Presby, the
Pitt community responded with anger and
confusion.

But Arbes stressed NDC had placed a bid '

before Presby got involved in March.
“They were brought as two separate offers,”
Arbes said. He said the Syria Temple had

rejected NDC’s original offer.
Thomas Detre, president of the UPMC, said

the actual negotiations were conducted by

Jeffrey Romoff, the UPMC executive vice
president. Romoff said at a Senate Council
meeting last week that NDC approached Pitt.

with an offer to cooperate on the purchase last"

fall. Pitt refused, according to Romoff.

Romoff said NDC then asked Presby to
collaborate on a similar $10 million effort, and
he met with Pitt Treasurer Ed Hunia and Pitt
trustee Farrell Rubenstein to discuss Pitt's
interest in the mosque. The university decided
to withdraw its bid, allowing NDC, acting on
behalf of Presby, to be- the sole bidder,
according to Romoff.

Hunia and Rubenstein were unavailable for
comment.

Arbes, speaking as the seller of the property,
said, “National Development Corporation is
the one providing the $10 million.”

Arbes said the lease did allow for a third
party to take part in the purchase but said
NDC would be responsible for payment. Arbes
said he did not know Presby was NDC’s anchor

tenant until after the sale.

“NDC is the one that promoted the buy,”
said Detre. NDC made the bid with the
understanding that Presby would occupy a
$40 million office complex that NDC would
build on the site. 0

“People rarely risk their own money," Detre
said. '

Detre said Presby’s offer allows Pitt the

option to buy the southern part of the property ,

within the next ﬁve years. The southern part
includes the Syria Mosque building and is
valued at about $8 million. The property could
hold about 280,000 square feet of office space,
compared to about 80,000 square feet available‘
on the remaining property.

Toby Chapman, an associate professor of
chemistry at Pitt, said at the Senate Council
meeting last week that he hoped the property,
centrally located on the Pitt campus, would be
used for classrooms or other educational
buildings,,rather than for office space.

“Our agreement is with National
Development [Corporation],” Arbes said.
“Whatever they do withit ... is up to them.”

Local scoutmaster honored

By Donna Terrell
Sta_ﬂ' Writer

Manford Sales is accustomed to
receiving awards for his volunteer
work in Pittsburgh’s black

- community. But he admits he was

a little surprised when he got a
call informing him that he was an
“official ambassador of light.”

“Never heard of it,” he told the
caller.

His first task as one of President
Bush’s honorees was totransport
a torch from Pittsburgh to Ohio,
where another ambassador was
waiting. He also attended a
reception on the South Lawn of
the White House, where he
received an award from Bush.

“It was nice,” Sales said. “We
got to see the president and Mrs.
Bush. We saw Mrs. Bush’s dog.”

Sales, 75, was honored by the
Point of Light Foundation for his
work with African—American
children. Sales has been the
scoutmaster of Troop 59 for 49
years.

The troop, which operates from
Ebenezer Baptist Church in the
Hill District, is Pennsylvania’s
oldest active black Scout troop.

The Point of Light Foundation
is a non—profit organization
working for public awareness of
volunteer services for children and
the elderly.

Sales said he sometimes .has to
be more than a scout leader to
boys in his troop. “I teach social
conduct, leadership .
everything,” he said.

“He is like a surrogate father to
the boys," said Larry Pickett,urban
scouting director ‘. f_or
Southwestern Pennsylvania.

Pickett, who helps urban scout

leaders recruit members, said
Sales “never had a problem
recruiting because his program
was so good.” «

Sales said his biggest challenge
is helping the youngsters in his
troop develop a sense of
responsibility.

“Children don’t even know how
to set thertable,” he complained.
“Most of them never held a lawn
mower. Then when they get older,
people worry about employment
problems.”

He received proclamations
from Pittsburgh City Council and
from the Allegheny County Board
of County Commissioners — both
monumental achievements for
someone who once sued the city
of Pittsburgh so blacks could swim
in public swimming pools and
who organized boycotts against
local businesses that would not
hire blacks.

Sales began his career as a civic
leader in 1949. As president of the
Greater Pittsburgh Improvement
League, he was responsible for
the hiring of the first black teller
in Pittsburgh National Bank and
the ﬁrst black salesgirl at Sears,
Roebuck and Co. 

He learned the power of
organized movements when he
organized a boycott of a A&P
supermarket in Homewood
because of its discriminatory
hiring practices. —

“They lost $5,000 in one
weekend,” Sales said.

Sales also oversaw the hiring of
the first black vendors at Forbes
Field.

“They told me. that people
wouldn’t buy hot dogs from
blacks,” he said. “Sixty men from

three churches sat in the stands"

during their first day of work to
make sure the black vendors were
not mistreated.”

Sales expressed his irritation
over some African-Americans’
apathetic attitudes toward helping
in the struggle for racial equality.
“No one wants to help when
you’re digging,” he said. Blacks
should realize that “if something
is worth getting, it is worth fighting
for,” he said.

He wants younger African-
Americans to become more active.
“I’m sick of talking black,” he said.
“If you talk about it, you should
be able to produce.”

Children, according to Sales, are
not to blame for their lack of
responsibility. He said parents

have become too liberal.

“Fathers like to play golf with
their buddies. They don't have
time for their sons.”

Sales said the biggest mistake
parents make is letting children
make their own decisions, and
most will choose baseball games
over scout meetings.

He said he has an average of 10
to 18 troopers when he “should
have 100.” But he is never
discouraged. He said he always
asks himself and his troopers,
5‘What’s going to happen if you
give up?”

Sales has no intention of giving
up work with the scouts.

“The Lord will probably retire

me. If I get one new boy, it makes "j

you want- to stay,” he said.

The recognition from the Point
of Light was not the first time he
has been awarded for his ‘work
with Troop 59. ‘ ‘

He was awarded the Silver
Beaver Award, scouting’s highest
honor, in 1975. ' ‘

A Pitt chemistry professor wants the
university president to be referred to as
“chancellor” to signify a return to academic
values.

“The title ‘chancellor’ reminds us that
this is a college campus and not a corporate
business. ‘Chancellor’ is a fine title.
President Posvar just wanted to be called
‘president,”’ said Toby Chapman.

On October 19, 1984, Posvar proposed
to the Board of Trustees that his title be
changed from chancellor to president. The
motion was approved.

“Posvar didn’t like the title because he

’ thought it was an inferior title. Most of his
' colleagues — presidents of other

universities — were ‘presidents.’ At those
universities, Chancellors were department
heads. Heads of other universities were
presidents,” said Chapman. “But
‘chancellor’ has a more academic ring to

it,” he said.

Chapman said the title ‘president’
represents a corporate attitude which
causes many of the problems at Pitt.

“That attitude has brought us to the
embarrassing stage we are at now. It has
created such embarrassments as the gross
excess of [Posvar’sl retirement package,”
Chapman said.

“It is this corporate mind—set that made it
OK to govern in secrecy. It is the mind—set
that allows the administration to overpay
themselves and underpay faculty. It creates
a boss—worker hierarchy” between the
administration and the faculty, said
Chapman.

Chapman claims that of the 57 colleges
in the American Association of Universities,
faculty salaries at Pitt rank 49th. Salaries for
administrators at Pitt are “all way ahead of
the AAU medians,” Chapman said.

Chapman said he will take his proposal
to the faculty assembly. If it gets faculty

Council, which has no legislative authority,
according to Chapman, but can make
recommendations.

The Board of Trustees would cast the
final vote on the proposal. Chapman said
he did not know if it would pass, but
“people I speak to, who are faculty
colleagues of mine, think it is a great idea.”

Mary Ann Aug, the assistant vice
president of University Relations, said
“[Toby Chapman] wrote a letter to  the
effect of his proposal  but the university
has no official reaction yet.” She said she
could not anticipate what that reaction will
be.

“There is a new person coming in whose
title will be president, and that’s where it
stands now,” Aug said.

Chapman said improving the university
must be a combined effort between the
administration and faculty where “everyone /
has to sacrifice. It is clear that Posvar did 4

THE PIT1‘ NEWS, Wednesday, June 19, 1991

 

By Dan Wonders
Staff Writer

Nearly 6,000 rapes will occur
on college campuses this year.

And it is estimated that 70
percent of those victims will know
their attackers, according to Walt

66

This legislation would create an actual
process of how universities would handle
sexual assaults, instead of the anything-
goes procedures that further traumatize

victims even more

Bill would mandate campus treatment of rape

Clinic are all available to assist
rape victims through the often
grueling medical and legal
proceedings that take place during
a rape investigation.

administrator for student health
at Pitt, said the bill will provide

as Korea. ,

Pittsburgh. . 99 “-It would certainly be a good graduates W1“ Intensify‘

With those statistics and the
recent public accounts of several
campus rape victims, date rape is
no longer the hidden crime it was
a decade ago.

The decisions of Amy Bradach
and Katie Koestner, both raped as
college freshmen, to tell their
stories not only shed light on a
poorly defined crime but may

«have helped prompt new federal

legislation that could mandate
how universities must aid campus
rape victims.

The “Campus Sexual Assault
Victims’ Bill of Rights Act” as
proposed by Congressman Jim
Ramstad, R-Minng, intends to
“ensure that campus authorities
treat sexual assault victims with
respect and make their legal rights
and options clear.”

Koestner, 18, of Mechanicsburg,
Pa., who appeared on the cover
of YYME magazine early this
month, was raped at the College
of William and Mary last fall.

Koestner said she’s transferring
from the Virginia school because
the student who raped her was
permitted to return to campus with
little more than a warning.

Officials at Carleton College
where Bradach, 22, and a resident

« of Rep. Ramstad’s home state, was

raped three and a half years’ ago
allegedly knew her attacker
committed four other rapes but
pressured her not to testify and
took no action against the suspect.

“There are somecampuses that
have done strong things” to cover
up campus rape, said Ellen Kerr,
volunteer coordinator for
Pittsburgh Action Against Rape.

Pitt, however, has always
cooperated with investigations of
rape cases, she said.

“I do think it’s important for any
campus to consider a sexual
assault as a crime and not try to
protect the university’s name. That

A just allows it to continue,” Kerr

said. “People do take risks on a
date. But I don’t think the
punishment for taking a risk on a
date should be getting raped.”
Ramstad’s press secretary
Darrell McKigney said he hopes
to change the attitude of some
school administrators who
attempt to ignore the problem,
hoping it will just go away.
“There’s been a need for victims’
rights advocacy for a long time.
This legislation would create an
actual process of how universities
would handle sexual assaults,
instead of the anything-goes
procedures that further traumatize
victims even more,” McKigney
said. The bill is awaiting hearings
by the House post—secondary
subcommittee for education and

-. labor.

The U.S. Senate has proposed
companion legislation with Sens.
Joseph Biden (D-Delaware) and
Arlen Specter (R.-Pa.) as sponsors.

McKigney said there wouldn’t
be a full vote on the measure until
September.

In addition to the above, the
new law would guarantee rape
victims the following rights:

-to be free from administrative
pressure to ignore the attack.
(Rape is one of the nation’s most
under—reported crimes. It is
estimated 90 percent of all rape
cases are never reported. And
according to figures from
Ramstad’s office, only 1 percent
of campus rapists is ever
prosecuted.) '

-to have the same legal
representation at a. hearing as the
accused A

0 to be informed of any rights to
have the‘ rape suspect tested for
transmittable diseases

-to have guaranteed safe
campus housing with full
protection from the assai1ant(s)

Universities must certify to the
Secretary of Education once a year
that these provisions are being
followed or risk losing eligibility
for federal funding, McKigney
said.

Pitt students may not see a
dramatic change if the bill passes.
There are already several facilities
and organizations on campus and
in Oakland available to help rape
victims.

idea to formulate an overall plan.
It would provide the opportunity
to bring all university procedures
together and make them readily
available to students,” she said. 9

Rape victims at Pitt are
automatically referred to Magee
and PAAR, Bowen said.

But like national statistics, the
number of ‘official rapes reported
by Pitt students probably is not an
accurate reflection of how many

S" rapes actually occur.

Bowen said some students don’t
seek help until years after the
attack. “They may not even know
that what happened to them was
a rape.” ‘

Waters said Pitt averages about
two reported rapes on campus

' and less than 10 reported rapes

off. campus each year.

“The problem nowadays is that
the estimates of unreported rapes
based on those reported seem’
inflated,” W,aters said.
“Convincing a jury that a woman
was raped on a date is a matter of
credibility. She may have said ‘no,’
but he didn’t stop. He says she
consented to intercourse but then
changed her mind. The jury has
to decide what really happened.”

“People have to be more careful.
No matter what the situation is,
when a woman says ‘no,’ that's it.
If her date forces sex, then it’s a
rape,” said Waters.

“Compared to other areas

Shuman said that
engineering requires a

to creatively solve technical
problems.

With strong job prospects
and high starting salaries

in engineering schools, “the

  Steel Phanto has

, By Mark Smith

fl

Stajf Writer

With the introduction of its new

’ roller coaster, the Steel Phantom,

‘Kennywood Park was the perfect
choice for the American Coaster
‘Enthusiasts summer conference
yesterday. Kennywood unveiled
the 3,000—foot-long coaster last
month.

Kennywood enticed more than
800 ACE conference participants
with an exclusive roller—coaster
ridebefore the park opened to the

,public. ACE members were

‘excited about their try on the Steel
Phantom’s record-breaking 225-
footldrop and heart—stopping
speeds reaching 80 miles per hour.

“It’s the most incredible 30 to 40
seconds,” Club President Ray
Ueberroth was quick to point out.

' The Steel Phantom train climbs
the first hill in roughly one minute.
Total ride time, according to
Kennywood, is one minute, 45
seconds.

Patrick Stockstill traveled from
his home in Beverly Hills, Calif.,
for a chance on the Phantom.
Stockstill’s love for roller coasters

'1 grew out of his fear of them. At the

age of 7, he fell from a tree and

broke his leg. “I have a fear of

’ heights and a fear of falling, and I
ride [roller coasters] to.overcome
this fear,” he said.

_ Exasperated after his first round
with the’Phantom, Stockstill
gasped, “It’s not as threatening
now that I've been on it.”

A Steve Cox, a systems analyst
from Seattle, Wash, said, “It’s a
niceismooth ride It’s like
gourmet fudge melting in your_
mouth. The Phantom is definitely
on my Top 10 list.”

Cable technician and New
Yorker Kevin Summer said, “It
worked me Very intense.”

The Steel Phantom was unveiled last month.

Thunderbolt as the No. 3 coaster
in the country and the Steel
Phantom as No. 5.

Randy Geisler, public—relations
director and former president,
described the Phantom as “a
breathtaking roller coaster.” ACE’s
decision to hold its summer
conference at Kennywood was
not only inspired by the new
coaster. I »

“lKennywoodl is just a great
traditional park. [The Steel
Phantom] was just 4 extra inches
of icing for us on an already
wonderful three~layer cake,”
Geisler said. 0‘

Founded in 1978, ACE is
described as “a non—profit
organization dedicated to the
recognition, enjoyment and
appreciation of the roller coaster
— the greatest thrill ride ever
devised.” .

ACE members are particularly
fond of the classic wooden
coasters. According to Ueberroth,
wooden coasters, which
numbered 2,000 in the 19205, now
number fewer than 500. 0

Riding with coaster enthusiasts
alleviated some of my fears of the
Steel Phantom. More terrifying
than its high speed was thgminuté
ride to the top of the Phantom’s
first drop. _

Overall the Steel Phantom had
its “ups" and “downs.” The ride
was nice and smooth,'but once
you enter the Phantom’s loop,
double-helix and corkscrew
inversions, get ready for a rough
ride. Depending on your body
size, the Phantom’s harness is
awkward and bothersome. For
me, it positioned my-elbows to
bang against the car at a painful
angle.

The Steel Phantom was certainly
thefastest coaster that I can recall.
Its intersection with I the
Thunderbolt roller coaster caused
a momentary thought of
decapitation by the coaster track.
On the other hand, it was ovei
before I had a chance to be
terrified by the speed or its twists
After you exit the coaster, you

‘will become compelled to ride
I again.

Reforms

Continued from page 1 ,
representatives of university faculty, staff and students. _

“A series of dismaying reports of fiscal impropriety and
malfeasance by university ofﬁcials in several areas have cast a
shadow on this institution," Staff Association Council President
Joanne Rosol said.

I Rosol denounced the effect that the “unrestrained greed and
corruption at the highest levels” will have on Pitt. '

“How can we. justify to students and parents the need for any
upcoming tuition increases? How can the university successfully
mount fund-raising campaigns in the current climate?” Rosol
asked. Rosol was given a standing ovation for her speech.

University Senate President Barbara Shore spoke for the
faculty of the university. “As we in the senate have said repeatedly
over many, many years, secretive and closed—door decisions
make the possibility vofunseemly decisions much more probable.
This has to be changed and now,” Shore said.

Shore questioned the trustees’ decision to bring in outside
consultants to review university policies.

. “Outside consultants in this {reform} process, wise as they may
be, are not the principal sources of insight. This is especially true
for those consultants who are not as related to the academic
enterprise as they may be to other enterprises. The principle
sources of insight are in fact, faculty, staff and students,” she said.

President-elect John Dennis O’Connor, who attended the
meeting with his wife, Anne, also addressed the trustees.

“I am wel1—aware of the admonition that you must know
history or be condemned to repeat it. I am fully aware of what
has transpired in the past several months, and I will use the
lessons and learn from what has transpired, but my vision is
forward,” O’Connor said. '

 Parade

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, June 19, 1991

 

Continued from page 1
Corvette convertibles that carried
all the VIPs. -

The returning troops waved as
they marched through
Downtown. Returning were the
14th Quartermaster Regiment
from Greensburg, the 328th
Quartermaster Regiment from
West Virginia and the 101st
Airborne Division, among others.

Veterans from Vietnam, Korea
and World War II also marched.
The Vietnam veterans, most of
whom were out of uniform, were
met with loud applause and a
shower of confetti.

A display of tanks and artillery,
including the Patriot missile, was
also featured. Several four—plane
contingents of A-10 Warthogs,
which were an integral part of
American aerial strategy in the
Persian Gulf War, tore across the
sky. *

Support groups forfarnilies with
friends and relatives in the Gulf
rode by on cars and in ﬂoats along
with several veterans’ groups.

Local high-school marching

bands kept the beat of the parade,
and the Royal American Regiment,
who were dressed as Minutemen,
provided music with ﬁfes and
drums. ~

Even Mrs. Pennsylvania
(Theresa McDonald) had a place
in the parade, as did her
counterpart, Miss Pennsylvania
(Catherine Weber).

The streets were lined with

. people waving “Old Glory” and

toting yellow ribbons. The parade
went from the Civic Arena, down
Fifth and Liberty avenues to Point
State Park, where the parade
ended.

“[The parade] is a great event
for Pittsburgh and the returning
Gls. I appreciate what they did,
and I think it’s great to greet the
boys coming back,” World War II
veteran Chester Oleniacz said.

“Events like this change the
opinion of a lot people about the
military,” Navy Recruiting Officer
john D. Lukus said. “People are
more receptive to men in
uniform,” he said.

Not everyone was receptive to

were the minority, however, and

The parade was organized by
the federal, state and local
governments, according to Mayor
Sophie Masloff.

contributed only services,”
Masloff said.

they would agree with it either.
It’s almost as though if we
celebrate enough, then that will
justify what we did.”

Activist Vince Eirene said that
the U.S. victory in the Persian Gulf
was like the Los Angeles Police
Department's “victory.” over
Rodney King, the man allegedly
beaten by several police officers.

According to Eirene, 750
children will die daily due to
cholera, dysentery and other
diseases caused by poor sanitation
after the war. Sanctions are
preventing necessities such as

. powdered milk from reaching

5?

Iraqi civilians, he said.

“I think that we’re trying to be
the conscience of America,”
Eirene said. ’

Mandy Kivowitz, a junior at
Taylor Allderdice High School,

said she was upset by the military -

aspect of the parade.

“If thiswere a ‘Bring home the
troops’ parade, I would be here to
celebrate the troops’ coming
home because I'm happy the
troops are back,” she said. “I’m
here [protesting] because the
parade is a show of military force.”

Rosemary Gazitua, who is a

member -of the Pittsburgh
Committee for a Comprehensive
Peace in the Middle East and has
a child who served in the Persian
Gulf, also expressed support for
the troops but not for the war.

“We have always supported the
troops, but we have not supported
the use to which the troops have
been put,” she said.

Gazitua said sanctions should
be lifted. _,

“I don’t believe the_balance that
we need can be restored to the
area in order to build a just and
lasting peace as long as one nation

Heavyatraffic, limited parking Concern Oakland citizens 

By Catherine Goldstein

‘For the Pitt News

Oakland residents complained
about” heavy trafﬁc and limited
parking when they attended a
workshop on transportation
issues sponsored by the
Department of City Planning last
Thursday.

“There are too many vehicles
on streets which are congested
and too narrow,” said Patrick
Hassett, the principal
transportation planner for the city,
as_ he displayed charts, of
Oakland's transportation patterns.

,To accommodate the 150,000

automobiles traveling through

Oakland each day, he suggested
widening roads and restricting
areas of traffic. V

Four small groups each
discussed parking, congestion,
residents’ needs and general
brainstorming. A

The parking group was led by
Leslie Kaplan of Iron Hill
Associates, a consulting firm
working with Wilber Smith
Associates on the transportation
seminar. '

Iron Hill planned the workshop,
and Wilber Smith will be
“developing a computer model
that will examine the possible

outcome of suggested
alternatives,” said Kaplan.

The group agreed that
because of the six hospitals,
three universities,‘ a high school
and 20,000 residents, additional
parking in Oakland should be
discoufaged. The city is
considering building parking
lots outside the central area, for
example on Bates Street, and
creating more shuttle services
to transport passengers to their
institutions.

. This has already been
executed by Children’s and
Montefiore hospitals, which
operate a lot on Second Avenue

THE PI'IT NEWS, Wednesday, June 19, 1991

as an option for their employees.

But this alternative is expensive
and often inconvenient for
motorists, according to several
workshop participants.

Several residents said the traffic
problems are caused by
approximately 21,000 visitors to
Oakland, who arrive each day for
reasons such as doctor’s
appointments, shopping or lunch.

According tojanet Thomas, the
parking manager of Pitt,
salespeople and university visitors
currently park in employee lots.
The department must call the
parking-lot attendant and give
notice of expected arrivals along

with their license-plate numbers.
A validation-sticker program will
be initiated soon at O’Hara and
Soldiers and Sailors garages,
which will make it easier for Pitt
visitors and the individual
departments to park in university
lots.

The “congestion” group dealt
with traffic. Kaplan said the
workshop might result in the
construction of more parking
garages. '

“Ideally we want to get people
to take the bus or the subway  or
to carpool, but our main concern
is to get people out of their cars,”
Kaplan said.

Sexism at VMI and Chatham

Recently, the question of sexism has arisen at Pittsburgh’s
Chatham College and the Virginia Military Institute.

Chatham College is a privately funded school for
women which be allowed to decide, without intrusions
from the state, whether or not it wants to accept men as

' students.

On June 10, a resolution was passed at Chatham,
disproving the speculation that the school would become
coed. ‘

VMI, a state-supported institution, has been an all-male
school for over 152 years. Two days ago a federal district
judge ruled that VMI does not have to change its
traditional policy of refusing to admit women.

VMI and the Citadel in South Carolina are the only two I

state-supported military schools in this country that do
not allow women to enroll. It is unfair that a female
resident of Virginia who wishes to attend VMI and who

._ has the stamina and willpower equal to that of a male VMI

cadet" cannot attend the institution —- yet her tax dollars
will help to fund the school.

It has been been argued that the inclusion of women
at ‘VMI would interfere with the discipline gained by the

' traditional humiliation of the “rats” of the freshman class,

who are forced-to undergo a grueling year of subservience
to upperclassmen. Past and present VMI cadets have said
that women would be incompatible with the shaved
heads and the insults.

But if a woman is willing to withstand the physical
punishment, she should be accepted for admission.‘

The Pitt News agrees that it is insulting for women to be
judged by different standards as men. Women who might
be accepted at VMI should not be judged by different
standards than the male cadets. At West Point, male
cadets and officers have rightfully complained that the
inclusion of women who are measured by more relaxed
standards than men has caused tension. _

Similarly, it is preposterous (not to mention dangerous)
for male and female firefighters or male and female
police officers to follow separate sets of regimens simply
because of their gender. But any woman who is capable
of doing the job should not be excluded.
.‘ Chatham is a different matter. The women of Chatham,
since their institution is privately funded, should be
allowed to exclude men. .

Men would not gain anything from being admitted to
a formerly all-women’s college, as women would benefit
from the specialized military training of VMI. Women’s
colleges are traditionally places where women can hold
leadership positions without being discriminated against
because of their sex. Women’s colleges like Chatham
should not be invaded by men unless there is a- good
reason to do so. -

No space in commuter's hell

This column is being written
under a bit 0’ stress because, as
I sit here, the parking meter
where my car is parked on Fifth
Avenue is ticking away. Yes,
that’s right, this article is about
the parking problems in
Oakland.

“It’s been done,‘ Dave,” you
say. Well, not by me it hasn’t. I

have been commuting to the _

University of Pittsburgh for two
years now, and I have all the
parking-ticketreceipts and a few
unpaid tickets to prove it. One
can’t park safely and effectively
in Oakland without shelling out
a great deal of money for a spot
in a lot or a private space
somewhere, neither of which is
guaranteed to be anywhere near

'“downtown” Oakland.

Let's take Oakland apart by
section, shall we? First, let’s
examine North Oakland. This
section has areas of free parking
on* the street in residential
neighborhoods, but one has to
be aware of the days when the
streets are cleaned, which
completely throws the balance
of parking into chaos. Then there
are the oodles of parking-meter
‘spaces throughout this section,
but they are limited to two hours.
Well, most people who are
fortunate enough to find a
metered space are surely going
to be unwilling to give it up after
two hours. So what do you do?

Some people choose to do the
just and honest thing and run to
their cars every two hours to
replenish the quarter supply in
the meters. As we all know,
however, that can add up to a lot
of money over the long haul. So
what most people elect to do is
to jam the meters so that they are
broken all day. Then they leave
for the meter maids a lovely note

David W.  
Matta

on the meters or on their
windshields‘ that says simply,
“Meter is broken." This is
something that Pittsburgh is very
famous for. I once walked down
Ruskin Avenue, and I saw six

cars in a row ‘on the same side of 7

the street with such notes with
them. Then you have those
neat little signs at every corner
which state that you can’t be
parked there even though they
are viable spaces, simply because
there aren’t meters there, and the
city of Pittsburgh has decided
that it’s wrong.

OK, it’s time for South Oakland,
the land of the parking permit.
Here is a vast area for commuters,
but the city has complicated this
by attaching the parking-permit

'rule to every street. This

deceptively allows the
unsuspecting parkers to park for
free for one hour while they are
“visiting”_ residents on the street,
but then they are given a $25

' ticket for their troubles. This is

more than any garage, lot, parking
meter, or even a ticket for an
expired meter. Other than this
big money-making scam by the
city, there are scattered parking
meters around this section, and
the rules concerning the meters
in North Oakland apply here as
well.

If one is fortunate enough to
have a parkin permit or a visitor’s
parking permit for South
Oakland, then the only thing you
have to worry about are street-
cleaning days on each side of the
street. This, of course, assumes

that you can find a place to park
at all, which may very welllbe
four to eight blocks away from
the hustle and bustle of Oakland,
which means that you are
walking as far to school as those
commuters who reside in
apartments in South Oakland.
Now this makes a lot of sense to
a commuter’ from outside the
Oakland vicinity. _ ._

The last people that you want
to mess with are the Pitt campus
police officers. They do their
jobs with pride. They take the
issue of illegal parking very
seriously; so do not park in a
‘university—monitored space, or
else you will face the
consequences of campus—police
tickets: I .

However, the ‘campus police
do not send a summons or boot
your car if you do not pay your

tickets. They let you run up a,

tab, and then they tow your car
from in front of the William Pitt
Union + not that I have any
personal experience with such
an event. Actually, I have heard
that if you do not pay your
campus-pqlice tickets, then the
university will not let you
graduate until your outstanding
tickets are paid.

So what words of wisdom and
advice do I have to offer to the
parking population in Oakland?
Nothing that you don’t already
know. Do whatever you can to
get away with whatever you can
and still keep your car parked
and unticketed. Or you can do
what I'm going to do. I’m going
to sell my car, buy a parking lot
and watch the money come
rolling in before I retire a
millionaire at the age of 30.

No one asks to be raped

 

Ross
Pasquale

Last month William Kennedy Smith
surrendered to the charge of felony second-

degree sexual battery for the alleged rape »

of a woman at the Kennedy family’s Palm
Beach mansion and was released on
$10,000 bail. After The Globe and NBC
released the name of the accuser, an
entirely new controversy erupted over

I’ whether or not the names of rape victims

should be released. This, along with the
notoriety of the Kennedy name, has
pushed this case to the forefront of the
public eye.

Rape is not bad sex or a sexual game or

C foreplay gone wrong. Rape is a violent

crime that is expressed through sexual
means. Smith, a recent graduate of
Georgetown’s medical school, claims he

I is guilty of no wrongdoing. The woman»

said she made the right decision in coming
forward, presumably because she believes
she has a chance of winning. Who will the
courts believe? _ _

Rape is extremely difﬁcult to prove. It
always comes down to his word against
hers and to the lawyers for the defense,
who invariably set out to drag every
miniscule detail about the accuser into the
courtroom. She was wearing provocative
clothing. She was dancing in a suggestive
manner. She agreed to see his etchings or
come in for a nightcap. None of these can
be translated into a woman asking to be
raped.

The media is, of course, going nuts with
this, and fora while I thought that someone

could be out there trying to tear the
Kennedys down once again. Could this

I be part of a larger plot? Could someone be

paying off this woman to further destroy
the Kennedy name? I mean, look at the‘
big picture: Jack’s dead; Bobby’s dead,
and Ted will never be president after
Chappaquiddick. Isn't it convenient that
Ted has to run for his seat again in
November? I think it’s pretty obvious that
somebody out there just doesn’t like Joe
and Rose’s little boys. Could this be a,
setup?‘ -

Then this theory went out the door
when I realized that Smith is a doctor and
probably has no intention of entering
politics. And what could this woman
possibly hope to gain by showing up at a
police station and taking on the powerful,
wealthy Massachusetts clan?

Smith has said that he has a lot of
conﬁdence in the system and believes
that “everything will come out in the
end.” This really frightens me. What if he
did rape her and his lawyer gets him off?
And this guy took the Hippocratic oath to
preserve life. - '

Maybe Smith will be proven guilty and
convicted. But what about all the women
who are raped every day and whose cases
don’t become media sensations? Do they
get convictions? Right now, there’s a
woman getting raped somewherefand
there’s nothing any of us can do about it.
This is what scares me. I think the actual
horror of the crime has been lost in the
shufﬂe of the Kennedy name and the
controversy of releasing the victim's
identity. Rape is something all of us
would like to forget about, but we can’t or
else people like Dr. Smith will continue to
commit crimes against women and get

away with them. As Jodie Foster once ‘

said, “Cruelty may be very human, and it
may be very cultural, but it is not

acceptable. ” Hopefully, no one will forget an

that as this case continues to unfold
across the headlines.

South Korean conﬂicts 

Joe
Babinsack

I lenow not what course others may
talee but, as for me, give me liberty or
give me death. — Patrick Henry

Having lived in a country where
freedom is taken for granted and the
government is ignored in the course of
a normal day, I have often thought that
the sentiment of Henry was lost. But
news reports from South Korea
convince me very much otherwise.
Over the ‘past several weeks at least
nine people have set themselves ablaze
in order to protest the oppressive
regime of Roh T ae-woo. These actions,

with the intent to spark a third major‘

series of uprisings in South Korea
since 1980, were set off by the brutal
slaying of a college student, Kang
Kyung—dae, at the hands of the South
Korean police force. Perhaps this time,
with the world looking toward
democratic movements, the people
will overcome their apathy and ﬁnally
achieve the objective of obtaining a
legitimate government.

Pathetically ironic is the fact that the
freedom gained by Henry over 200
years ago has been a great contributing
factor to the existence of the right-
wing totalitarian governments that have
ruled South Korea. Since South Korea
exists primarily because of U.N.
intervention to stop a communist
invasion and since its government has
welcomed a continued U.S. military
presence, our government has not
interfered with the oppressiveness of
the South Korean governments.
Though popular uprisings have
denounced both their government and

. U.S. presence in their country, the

United States has ignored military
crackdowns against the South Koreans
despite the similarity to ones it decried

 

in communist states in Eastern Europe.

Meanwhile, those" communist
countries have succumbed to a.
worldwide movement to democracy.
The major exception is in the Orient,
where China has thwarted internal
strugglefor democracy by remaining
isolated to much of the world, though
again, the United States sees no reason
to pressure China toward democracy
as it continues to provide favorable
trading status. ' A A ‘

North Korea remains staunchly
communist, but one mustwonder if the

fear of the U.S. military in the South has

forced it to fortify its position. A growing
sentiment for uniﬁcation of the two
countries exists in both among the
students, but the South Korean
government, more comfortable in
power with strong, indirect military
support from the United States and
economic superiority over the North,
refuses to give in to the will of the

‘ people.

The United States’ conservative and
reactionary policies to contain

communism have made the world a

safer place — for those living in the
West. Maybe if the. U.S. policy had
been to strengthen countries bordering
communism democratically instead of

_mi1itarily, then the comfortable world

we live in would be felt by,many more
people and probably would ‘have
occurred ‘a lot sooner. (Consider the
tenacity with which people try to_ gain
freedom, and think about how much
more they would ﬁght to keep, it.)
Instead, the lessening nuclear and
expansionist threat of the Soviet Union
has been traded for growing anti-
American sentiment in countries allied
with ours. Now the people of those
countriessee the freedoms granted to
the once communist people, and rightly
blame the United States for helping to
suppress their rights for so long.

personiﬁed.” This Supreme Court
decision requires Planned
Parenthood and other family
planning agencies to discontinue
counseling for abortion or give
up Title X government funding.

I differ with the negative
attitude expressed in this article.
Instead I see this decision as a
positive step that offers
protection to teens and women
by putting a stop to one of the
pressure-filled, aggressive
activities of Planned Parenthood.
This powerful organization is
the N o. 1 provider and promoter
of abortion in the world. All their
programs and services teach and
spread their philosophy of
control. ‘ I

That means control of teen
sex through bypassing parental
permission, control of sex-
education curriculums, control
of the life of the unborn child,
teaching their control doctrines
in the schools and population
control in the United States and
in Third World countries.

This decision by the Supreme
Court is long overdue although
perhaps too late for many.
Abortion was made legal in 1975, I

and since then 26 million
abortions have been performed.
[...l

Abortion is not a simple
medical procedure. Instruments
are inserted without visibility into
what has been described as a
highly vascular area. However,
we have no statistics on the

' physical and psychological harm

it exerts on women.
That is because abortion is
the only surgical procedure in

which the physician is not obliged ‘

to advise the patient of the risks
and is the only surgical procedure
where reporting complications
and death is not required.
Although we have no statistics
on the scars women carry, we do
know from the science of
embryology that each abortion
is 100-percent fatal to an unborn
living human being.

Yet The Pitt News article refers
to Rust vs. Sullivan as “hell

personified.” It is abortion that is ,

“hell personified,” not the
Supreme Court decision that
helps to curb a powerful, high-
pressure, well—funded birth
control and abortion industry
that is in drastic need of
regulation.

A Letters

Concern for R.0.T.C.

I am writing to express my
concern with your report on
ROTC programs on the University
of Pittsburgh campus which was
recently released.

I think your committee report
is wrong. I think it is based on a
ﬂawed estimate of the situation.

Had I in an undergraduate
class applied the samestandards
of scholarship your committee
applied in assembling facts
presented in this report, my
instructor would have scribbled
notes in red pen and given me a
nasty grade.

The recommendations
contained in this report are ill-
conceived at best and downright
stupid at worst. It is obvious the
members on the ad 'hoc
committee did not bother to
research the basis of an ofﬁcer’s
commission in the U.S. armed
forces. V

The basis for the code of a
commissioned armed—forces
officer is part official and part
written, but mostly unwritten.

‘ Simply put, the armed—forces

officer is part of our executive
branch of national government.

Once national policy has been
determined by the constitutional
civilian leadership of our national
government, the officer or soldier
must support it as their orders
require. 7 '

Furthermore, I find
objectionable the phrase in the
report which says, “These policy
recommendations are based on a
careful examination of the
policies ‘adopted in a number of
universities across the country.”
How many universities? Where?
The report does not say.

The report totally overlooks
the fact that students interested
in ROTC are a decided minority
on this campus. Perhaps not more
than 130 students are taking ROTC

classes at any given time. That’s

as awfully small number

compared to the total Pitt’

undergraduate population. In a
twist almost straight from Orwell ’s
Animal Farm, the committee
seems to say, “All minorities are
equal, but some are more equal
than others.”

If these recommendations of
the university senate} are
approved by the University of
Pittsburgh trustees, I shall not
send one dollar to any alumni
giving fund. I shall tell all my
family and friends to do likewise.
I will tell any Pitt alumni I meet to

do the same.

' A special thanks for publishing

This story, containing the ﬁndings

is sobering to think that men’s

Hollywood director smells fear in Naked Gun 22]"

By Matthew Myers

. Staﬂ“W7riter

In 1982, millions of TV viewers
nationwide sat riveted to their
seats, watching one of the
funniest, wackiest, most
outrageous comedy shows ever
produced on prime time. That
show was “Cheers.” But another
show called ‘Police Squad! ” was
justas hilarious and even zanier.
The trouble was, nobody watched
it.

Now, all six obscure but sterling
episodes of that show are

 __ _ available on_home video, and the

program's lucrative successor, The
Naked Gun.- From the Files of
Police Squad! has become the
granddaddy of parodic spoofs,
rocketing past Mel Brooksdom

  into the mainstream superstardom
 of its icons,.Leslie Nielsen and
Priscilla Presley.

The warped and creative forces
behind The Naked Gun and its
upcoming sequel, TheNaked Gun
2_ 1Q- The Smell of Fear, (and the
as—yet-unknown comedy Lame
Duck) are the Zucker brothers
(Jerry and David, not to be
confused .with the Smucker
brothers, Peraldo and Lippy) and"
their-good buddy Jim Abrahams.

Their first feature, Kentucky
Fried Movie (1977) was one of
Hollywood's bashful attempts to
take the high road to satiric
comedy (“Am I serious?”). They
followed with the underestimated

Top Secret! (1984), starring then-
unknown Lizard King Val Kilmer.

And we all know them for their
two very successful spoofs in the
early '80s, Airplane! and
Airplane II.- The Sequel. And of
course, let’s not forget Ruthless
People (1986), their biggest and
most hilarious blockbuster ever.

Later, as fame would have it,
they all went their separate ways.
Jerry went on to direct the biggest-

grossing tear-jerker of last year, .~

Ghost, while David and Jim sat
around and pointed at people's
privates. Well, not exactly. They
decided to spoof a scene from
brotherJer’s picture. Now, they’re
all back — bigger, badder and
deffer, than ever. And they’ve
changed their underwear.

I recently spoke to David
Zucker, the smart fellow who
wrote, produced and directed
Naked Gun2 I/2. As we sat in his
favorite restaurant, sipping hot
water and lemon juice, he reached
across the table and throttled me,
telling me I was not fit to date his
sister. So, I had to call him by
telephone to ﬁnish the interview.

MATI‘ MYERS: What factors
do you think contributed to the
demise of “Police Squad!”?

DAVID ZUCKER: Well, I think
it was because it should have

been a movie. And I think people i

don’t really. pay attention to
television. That's what Tony
Thomopolous, the head of ABC
at the time, said. “Police Squad!”
didn’t work on television because
you had to watch it. You wonder

Director David Zucker of Naked Gun 2 1/2.

what that says about his other
shows. People don’t pay that
much attention. They’re
distracted. In our movies we have
so much detail that’s happening
in the background. I think people
can really see that if they’re in a
theater, concentrating on a big
movie screen. That just doesn’t
work on television. And the other
thing is, the time pressure in
producing television is so great;
we had to produce ’a half hour
every week. You know, the
quality suffered. There were late-
night writing sessions where we
just said, “Well, we can't think of
a better joke, so we’ll have to
settle for this.” In the movies, we
don’t have to settle for anything.
You have about two years to
make what amounts to three half-

hour shows. You can see how _-

the quality is a lot better. Of
course, we’ll see what the critics
say.

M.M.: Given that Naked Gun is
your seventh picture that takes
the high road to satirical comedy,
do you think you’ll ever dabble
in any other genres?

D.Z.: If I came up with a good
idea for anything, I would be
attracted to that, whether it be a
comedy or a serious idea. I think
the most important thing is the
idea. Right now, it’s The Naked
Gun with Leslie Nielsen. That.
idea with that cast is just really a
lot of fun to do, and I think it’s a
really good vehicle to do satire.

M.M.: Why “2 1/2’? Are we
getting something more for our
money?

D.Z.: It's just a joke, really,
although some people have
inferred more intelligence to it
than we had meant.

M.M.: Well, I think it's funny.

D.Z.: Then it worked.

M.M: Is there a lot of
competition now between you
and Jerry?

D.Z.: Well, I don’t think so. We
work together, and whatever we
do helps each other. The first
Naked Gun helpedJerry a lot just
because it put us in a better
position with the studios. It gave
us more clout. And then Ghost

has really helped me. So we
really root for each other and
help each other out with script
notes and things like that.

M.M.: Trite question: how did
you, Jerry and Jim Abrahams get
from Milwaukee, where you grew
up, to Hollywood?

D.Z.: It's kind of a mixture of
things. We grew up in kind of a
good area for comedy. I have to
say coming from Milwaukee was
part of it. I think we found that
the people we grew up\with had
a really good sense of humor. We
always thought that the people in
our high school, for _instance,
were funnier than we were. I
think the difference was that when
they graduated, they were able to
find jobs. So we just decided to
do what we liked best.

M.M.: What part of Milwaukee
did you grow up in? _

D.Z.: Shorewood. And then I
went to school at the University
of Wisconsin. It was there that we
started our Kentucky Fried
Theatre, but it's the usual stuff
that you always hear about. You
know — hard work, persistence.
I think we had a really headstrong
attitude. We never believed
anything other than we could
succeed. We really were
overconﬁdent, and that helped
carry us through. And we had
camaraderie, or whatever you

' call it. We really did stick together.

You know, we loaded up our U-
Haul in 1971 and went out to [Los
Angelesl and found an old
warehouse, and we remodeled it
into a theater, doing all of the
carpentry and rewiring ourselves.
We were really jacks of all trades.
We wrote, produced, directed,
performed in and tore the tickets
for our shows. But you start out
on a shoe string like that, and one
thing leads to another. After we
were in L.A. for" a while, we
learned the ropes, met people
who knew what they were doing,
and we learned how to write
scripts and started writing our
own, and it happened like that. I
mean, everyone has a different
way of getting into the business,

‘but mostly, I think it was

Pitt News File Photo

persistence. We never gave up.
And the people thought that the
stuff we were writing was funny.
That helped.

M.M.: If you continue to do
parody, what other genres are
you interested in attacking?
You've done airport disaster
movies, spy movies and cop
movies. What are you going to
make fun of next?

D.Z.: Well, our mode of
operation is not really to skewer
different genres, at least I don’t
think so. I don’t think there are
too many genres. The police genre
is pretty good to satirize. I mean,

all ourjokes in The Naked Gun
are not speciﬁcally about police.
Within that genre, we’re able to
satirize a lot of different things.
An example of that wouldbe the
baseball game in Naked Gun 1.
And we’re doing the environment
in this movie, Naked Gun 2 1/2.
So, I don’t think after this we’re
going to- go off exploring other
genres. If anything, if we do this
again, we would really do another
Naked Gun.

M.M.: What subjects are you
attacking in Naked Gun 2 1/2?

D.Z: Nuclear power
companies, oil companies and,
uh, (laughs) the government,
which is kind of a big chunk to
take on. ‘

M.M.:AWhen’s the release date?

D.Z.: June 28. If we get the
movie done on time.

M.M.: What's not done?

D.Z.: Well, we’re still mixing
and previewing. And the
previewing is an editing process.
We always let the audience
choose which parts of the movie
stay in and which go. We make
our best guess during the writing
and ﬁlming of the movie, which
took about a year and a half in
this case. We make our best guess
as to what’s funny, but ultimately,
we take it up in front of test
audiences. " ”

M.M.: Have you ever had to
make major changes because of
poor test ratings?

D.Z.: Oh, yeah, always. Every
preview astonishes us —- what
works and what doesn’t work.

And there’s always things that
don’t work. But in the ﬁnished
movie, the regular movie
audiences never get to see those
things. They assume we Wrote a
perfectly funny movie.

M.M.: Are there jokes that
people won’t get? I remember
watching tapes of the TV series,
and each time I saw them, I
noticed something new in the
background or on the soundtrack.

D.Z.: Definitely. There are
things we know about because
we do a question—and-answer
session after each preview
audience, and some of the jokes

half the audience saw, but the _

other half didn’t. And those are
things we can't help; so people
just have to go back and see it

I again. And some jokes we’re sure

will only be seen on the video
cassette because they’re subtle.
People will just have to really
examine the movie pretty closely
to catch some of -the details.
M.M.: What studio or
production company are you
working with now? «
D.Z.: Well, this production
company is really just me, Bob
Weiss, whom I did KentuckyFrled
Movie with, and Bob Locash —
he’s the associate producer, but
kind of functions as a part—time
writer on these two movies —'
and Pat Proft, whom I wrote the

' script with. Those are the people

who really made this movie.
M.M.: How much trouble did
you have getting the ﬁrst Naked
Gun green-lighted?
D.Z.: No trouble at all, really.
In fact, we were at Disney at the

time making RuthlessPeople, and ‘
Jerry and I andJim Abrahams had '

lunch with Frank Mancuso, who
was then the head of Paramount,
and we just mentioned that we'd
like to do “Police Squad!” as a
movie, then untitled. And he
said, “That’s a great idea. You
should have done it four years
ago.” So, that’s how hard it was.

M.M.: What inspired you guys
to come up with this idea in the
first place?

D.Z.: Actually, we were doing

_ publicity for Ruthless People with

Frank. After Top Secret! did not
perform as well as we had

expected (although it made a-

proﬁtx for the studio), we did
Ruthless Peoplebecause we didn’t
know if the zany comedy would
still work. So we did a
conventional comedy. We were

"in France, showing Ruthless

People at a ﬁlm festival, when
somebody came up to me after
the movie and told melhe liked it,
but he wished we would go back
to doing. our comedies like
Airplane! and Top Secret! It kind
of made an impression on me.
The other thing thathappened
was when we got back to Los
Angeles, we had lunch with'Mel
Brooks and he beat us up. He
said, “Why are you guys doing
stuff like Ruthless People. You
guys should be doing the
Airplane!/Top Secret! stuff.” It

 I   

Zucker

was then thatl really decided that I wanted 0

to do “Police Squad!” as a movie.

M.M.: Do you really consider your
movies satire, or are they really some kind
of broad parody or burlesque? I

D.Z.: Well, parody and satire — who

knows what the real differences between ,

them really are? It gets into semantics. In
Naked Gun 2 1/2 there are elements of all
of those, including farce. In one point, in
the third act, you have a very_ farcical
situation. It’s a parody of a lot of things.
It’s satire. I would say it’s mainly satire.

M.M.: In the press kit for Naked Gun 2
1/2, you claim that the movie is based on
a book. This is a joke, right?

D.Z.: Yeah. The author in question was

' actually a woman who wrote children’s

books in the Great Depression.

 What compelled you, Jerry and
Jim, to temporarily break up?

D.Z.: Well, after Ruthless People, we
decided to really do our own separate
projects. That’s why Jim went and did Big
Business and I did Naked Gun. What
happened on the first Naked Gun was that
Jerry and Jim each wrote about 20 pages.
Pat and I wrote the rest and did the six
months of rewriting. Jerry did Ghost; Jim
did a movie called Roxy Carmichael, and
I did Naked Gun 2 1/2, which I wrote alone
with Pat. There really is no ZAZ (Zucker/.

_ Abrahams/Zucker Productions) anymore.

It pretty much ended with Ruthless People.

M.M.: In the trailers for Naked Gun 2 1/
2, there is a scene in which Leslie Nielsen
and Priscilla Presley satirize the pottery-
wheel lpve scene from Ghost. Who came
up with that?

D.Z.: I came up with that.

M.M.: How did your brother Jerry feel
about that?

D.Z.: Well, I called him up. See, after the
second time I saw Ghost, I realized that
one of the main impressions I came away
with was that clay pottery scene. I said,
“Why don’t we do that with Leslie and
Priscilla?” I thought that would be very

If I came up with a good idea for anything, I would be
attracted to that, whether it he a comedy or a serious

idea.

—David Zucker

funny. So I called him up right away and
told him, and he almost dropped the
phone, he was laughing so hard. So I
think no matter how serious a movie each
of us would do,‘Jerry always has a sense
of ‘humor about the whole thing.

M.M.: Now thatJerry’s picture has been
nominated for an Academy Award, do
you think you might have the same
potential?

D.Z.: I don’t think comedy will ever get
any acknowledgement from the Academy,
and I’m not really in it for the awards. I do
it to make people laugh. Maybe someday
— 50 years from now — they'll have an
award for movies like Naked Gun, but right
now, it’s a great challenge to make people
laugh. It doesn’t bother me. The industry
supports ﬁlms like Dances With Wolves
and Driving Miss Daisy, movies which
wouldn't get seen without the exposure
of national awards. But it’s probably a
good system. I mean, I don’t know why
the hell I need an award. Often there’s no
rhyme or reason for it anyway, why one
thing is nominated over another — you
know, best apple or orange. It just doesn't
matter to me, I guess.

M.M.: How did you end up castingJohn
Turturro in your other upcoming picture,
Lame Duck? A

D.Z.: Well, our- casting director
auditioned a lot of people. He went all
over the country and put people on tape,
doing the same scene on video. One of
the people we saw was Turturro. We
went to see him in-Millers Crossing. The

guy’s a fine actor, but we. really didn’t see I

him as Flackmeiser until we saw the video
that the casting director had provided for
us. He was the one who really made us
laugh.

M.M.: Do you have the ﬁnal word when
it comes to casting?

D.Z.: Oh yeah, we have the ﬁnal say.

M.M.: How did you manage to do two
movies at once, i.e. LameDuck and Naked
Gun'2 1/2?

D.Z.: It was very hectic. I’ve been
working seven days a week on both
movies. I haven’t been able to give Lame
Duck as much time as I'd like, but
fortunately Jerry has been there for it. I
was in the script development stage while
Jerry was on Ghost. And I worked with Pat
Proft. When we started producing, it was
really produced concurrently with Naked
Gun; so Jerry was able to pay it a little
more attention than I could.

M.M.: What is the release date on that
film?

D.Z.: There is no date yet, but it’ll
probably be sometime in late July.

M.M.: You’re the writer, producer and
director of this film. Do you find it a bit
chaotic doing all these jobs, or is there one
job you would prefer to do?

D.Z.: Writing is probably the hardest.
And as soon as I got finished with that, I
thought that directing was the hardest. I
think that post—production is probably
easier —— you know, the editing process,
the mixing and so forth. I think that
producing is actually easier than getting in
the trenches. Having to write every day
and facing a blank page is very difficult.
And the pressure of shooting the two
pages a day is also difficult. When I’m
doing any one thing, I always wish I was
doing another.

M.M.: Is Naked Gun 2 1/2 as funny as
the first one?

D.Z.: Well, I think so. Hopefully. Ithink
the expectations are going to be very high

' for this one. I don’t think there was much , _
expectation either way on the first one. ; . ,

Those are the problems we face, and that’s
not my fault; so I don’t even think about
them. ‘‘

M.M.: When you’re shooting the Naked

Gun movies, do you get any input or J

improvisation from Leslie Nielsen?

D.Z.: Not as much as you'd think. If
we’ve made a writing mistake and done
something he’s not comfortable with, he
has an excellent instinct for-that. He'll just
kind of wince and give me that look.
We’ve worked together so long, we can
almost communicate without speaking at
this point. He can communicate to me if
something’s bothering him, and I always
trust him — his instincts are very good. I
won’t try to force him into anything he’s
uncomfortable with because he’s usually
right about things. And so I’ll try to rework
the script a little bit to change something.
But it’s very rare that he’ll want to change
a word. We always insist that every word
be performed exactly as it is in thejscript.
There is very little improvising on the set.

M.M.: Do you have any advice for
young, aspiring filmmakers who want to
make it in Hollywood?

D.Z.: When people ask me what advice
I’d give to aspiring student ﬁlmmakers, I'd
just say, “Quit now.” And then, if you can

disregard that advice, that’s probably your .

first step on the way to being successful.
I guess what I mean to say is that it really

is a lot of persistence ——— [that is] the major .
ingredient. You really have to have so

much conﬁdence in yourself that you’re

just going to do it no matter what. When _
.1 hear people say, “Well, I’ll go out there
and give it a couple of years,” I usually _.

don’t have too much conﬁdence in the
person’s chances. You just have to love

doing it so much that you’re willing to do

just about anything and wait it out. My
Dad told me when I left Milwaukee to go
to L.A., “Just remember one thing. Rome
wasn’t built in a day.” And I think it was the
best advice I ever received.
