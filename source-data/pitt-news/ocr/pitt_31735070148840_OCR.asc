Gideon Bradshaw
For The Pitt. News

In the span of three weeks, Cory Rod-
gers made the 7,500—mile journey
between Tanzania and Philadelphia
—twice. ,

« The Pitt student ﬂew to the United
States for an interview with represen-
tatives from the Rhodes Trust on Nov.
18. Bythe end ofthe day, hewas named
one of32 Rhodes Scholars naﬁonwide,
the seventh Pitt student ‘ever to receive
the title.

On Monday, Rodgers returned to
Tanzaniato continue hisworkwithHIV
andAIDS patients. Heis currently com-
pletinghis Pitt courses from Tanzania
and hopes to ﬁnish his degrees by the

end oftheyear. Rodgers’ degrees_inthe ‘

works include aBachelor ofPhilosophy

degree in Africana studies and the his-

' tory and philosophy of science, and a

Bachelorof Science degreeinbiological
science with a chemistry minor.

_ Rodgers said that being named» a
Rhodes Scholar; along with the atten-
tionthat comes with it, stillfeels unreal
to him.

“Atﬁrst, whenyou seeyournamein

it’s you,” he said. ,

Pitt uses social media to connect to students, public

Gideon Bradshaw
For The Pitt News

As social media sites like Twit-

ter and Facebook become more_

popular, many departments at

V" Pitt have begun “tweeting” and

soliciting “likes.”

Some of Pitt’s academic de- '
partments and administrative

offices have launched social me-
dia devices, for purposes rang-
ing from publicizing events to
answering prospective students’
questions. The departments use
different means of staffing and
funding to try and better con-
nect students and the University
community.

Pitt’s Writing Program logged
onto Twitter for the first time

 

last month, after giving log—in
information to tenured faculty

and graduate students who are T
able to post and remove content

from the site. _ .

Josh Patton, a junior writ-
ing major and student employee
with the Department of English,
also contributes to the @Pit-
twriters Twitter page-, which
seeks to create an online writ-
ing community. .

“One of the things that w
talked about in the meetings,
and one ofthe reasons I came to
Pitt, is that it’s a community of
writers,’.’ Patton said. ‘7We want
some kind of engaging contact
to take learning outside th
classroom.” -

The writing ‘program’s Twit-
ter features tweets about de-

partment events, and links to

alumni’s publications. Thus far, _
@PittWriters checks in at 88

total tweets and more than 100
followers. . ,

_Pitt’s women’s studies pro-
gram also seeks to create a vir-
tual community. In 2009, the
programreceived a $20,000
grant from the Office of the
Provost to start its Internet
programs.

Rebecca Roadman, program

V assistant for women’s studies,

said the program largely used
thefunding to have Pitt’s Uni-
versity Marketing Communi-
cations write_ the code for the
women’s studies’ wiki and blog.
The money also went to other
implementation and set-up ex-
penses. The department’s wiki,

blog and Twitter became fully
functional in the spring.
Jean Ferguson Carr, the di-

_ rector of the woman’s stud- V

ies program and an associate
professor, of English, said that
social media connects many us-
ers and draws attention to the
women’s studies‘ program and
the University as a whole.

“I think it’s crucial for edu-
cational institutions to be open
to the public about what they’re
doing,” she said.

Students in the Introduction
to Women’s Studies classes post
on the blog, writing about gen-
der issues and course-related
topics. .

“The students in the Intro
to Women’s Studies class have
begun to show more pride in

their work,” Roadman said, add-
ing that students’ awareness of
the wider audience seems to-
improve the quality of their
writing.

The College of Business Ad-

ministration’s Career Services -

uses its Twitter account to alert
students to employment and in-
ternship opportunities. It also
posts links for events and ar-
ticles related to career develop-
ment and breaking news in the
business field.

].P. Matychak, the director of
CBA’s Career Services, said that
while Career Services has used
media sites and video confer-
encing for about three years, he
has seen traffic and posting on
the site increase this year, with

Edward Stricker, dean of Pitt’s Honors
College.

“I foresee that these graduate pro-
grams will broaden and deepen his
knowledge of the very issues he con-
siders to be of most importance to his
long—term plans,” Stricker said in an
email.

In addition to the 32 American
winners, the Rhodes Trust awards
the scholarship to students around
the globe. Last year, 51 students from
outside the U.S., though this number
varies from year to year.

judithzang, Pitt’s national scholar-
ship advisor, said that the application
for the Rhodes scholarship includes
betweenﬁve and eight letters of recom-
mendation along with a 1,000-word
personal statement.

Zang said that she did very little to
help Rodgers, who had already won
the Samuel Huntington Public Service
Award andagrantfromthe Foundation
for Asia Paciﬁc Education by the time
hebeganhis applicationforthe Rhodes
Scholarship last spring.

“By the time he got to this one, his
focus was just very, very sharp,” Zang
said. *

Fortherestofthisyear, Rodgerswill
continue workingto improve the living
conditions for 22 men and women liv-
ing with HIV and AIDS in Manzese, a
district of Dar-es—Sa1aam in Tanzania.
The patients are members of two local
support groups that Rodgers became
associated with once he arrived in the

country.
Rodgers said that while the Tan-

zanian government provides its HIV-
positive citizenswithmedication, basic
sanitation and nutrition are harder to
come by in shanty towns like Manz-
ese.

AIDS medication can be just as
dangerous as the’ disease iiselffor the
poorly nourished, and Rodgers has
been working with support groups
to plan a project that he hopesvwill
improve the health and quality of life
for the 22 patients.“It’s a very speciﬁc
projectthatfocuses on generatingfood
and income,” he said abouthisplansto
bring urban agriculutre methods like
sack gardening to the town.

EDITORIAL

Students aren’t
heard, respected

As you probably know, Pitt isn’t

the most progressive school‘ on r

the block.

‘ Yesterday, The Pitt News
reported that the University’s
housing policy does not allow for
same-sex or gender—neutral room-
ing assignments. Several colleges,
such as Rutgers University and
‘Carnegie Mellon’ University, have
implemented policies that allow
for these assignments to better ac-
commodate transgender students
who seek housing with the genders
with which they identify.

Having a traditional policy is
one thing. Neglecting to explain
one’s reasoning is another. ‘

When The Pitt News sought an-
swers, it was put in contact with

L spokestmanpjohn Fedele, who de-

  

clined “gletusl in on the logic be-
hind-th’e adding-housing policy.

tices. Essentially, it is disrespecting

According to its website, “every
graduate  should leave the Uni-

versity with four key attributes: ‘

communications skills, a sense of

motivation,’ a sense of responsibil- .
~ ity and a sense. of self.”
Is it not hypocritical that Pitt .

stresses the importance of com-
munications skills but continually
fails to answer students’ questions?
Last month, we wrote an editorial
that condemned the University’s
lack of communication with club
sports teams about the use of
sports facilities. Pitt didn’t give
an answer then, either.‘

. As for a sense of self: Pitt has

quite the chutzpah to valuesome-
thing like that while it pigeonholes
transgender students into desig-
nated gender assignments. And

we’re supposed to leave here with '

a sense of individuality while we’re
all treated the same way.
And motivation and”responsi-

bility? Once Pitt develops these,"

qualities and‘ can muster up 
impetus for responsibly and ‘ef-
fectively communicate with its

’ students, maybe it can rightfully

patronize us with what is current-
ly such a duplicitous guideline to
post-graduation success.

. It’s not possible that a school

can serveits students withoutad-

way, has been a hot topic, for de-

cades. It isn’t something iffy that

THE SCHAFFIDAVIT

Europe might be doomed,

Matt Schaff
Columnist

Well, at least Europe was a lot of
fun while it lasted.

As you likely know, it’s getting
harder and harder for European

_. Union countries to finance their
debts, heightening the possibil-

ity of system-wide default and
all theeconomic turmoil that
entails.

Ever since it became clear
that Greece, with its herculean
debt-to-GDP ratio, would not
be paying its creditors in full -—
many holders of Greek bonds
had to accept a 50 percent loss
three weeks ago — investors are
dumping European government
‘bonds, which countries use to
raise much-needed funds, in
droves. Mass sell—button-press-

i ing raises the interest rate that

governments must pay for each
new dollar (or euro) of borrowed
money. Once this interest rate,
or cost of borrowing, reaches a
certain level —- like 7 percent
on 1,0-year notes — borrowing
is said to.be.un‘s’ustainable (i.e.,
the’ amount of borrowed money
needed to‘ ‘pay interest on inter-

-;est balloons exponentially).

Although c’o—llege-student-

" frequented »news outlets have

concerned themselves with
things like the Penntlstate scan-

' dal and pepper spraying at UC

Davis, let’s be clear — interest
rates for Greece, Ireland, Spain
and Portugal bonds have already
been there. Add in the failure of
European technocrats to secure
outside money for a “bazooka”
bail-out fund and Germany’s in-
sistence against, for historical
reasons, the inflation option -
i.e., the European Central Bank
creating trillions of euros to
buy undesired bonds -— a mas-

sive realization of unfathom— -

able amounts of sovereign debt
seems barreling toward us. And
the likely effects of that inexora-
ble debt barrel aren’t so savory:
the EU disintegrating, austerity

unrest), the ﬁnancial system

But don’t drown in worry -
there’s no guarantee that Eu-
rope’s descent into fiery doom
will happen immediately. And
it might take even more time
for the sovereign debt crisis to
bring down already—dubiously
solvent U.S. banks, considering
their large gross exposure to Eu-
ropean debt. So before you cash
in your stock portfolio, here are
some simple ways any busy col-
lege student can stand in soli-
darity with his or her European
brethren and celebrate the glori-
ous, embattled traditions of the
motherland:

rich-and extensive history _

of industrial production,
championship-winning sports
teams and  brewing. Although
beer might not be the ﬁrst Pitts-
burgh industry that comes to
mind, the city has had an impor-
tant presence in the brewing busi-
nesslsince the 19th century. Today,
there are several breweries, each
distinctive in its own way, that
continue to produce high quality
beer within the city limits.

Sure, lots of American cities are
full of breweries, but what makes
Pittsburgh stand out? Historically,
it’s been a leader in Pennsylvania
brewing and has developed a mod-
ern brewing scenethroughout the
years. While each local brewery
has its own answer to the question
of why brewing in Pittsburgh is
special, a look at both the histori-
cal breweries of the past and the
innovative breweries of the pres-
ent can demonstrate Pittsburgh’s
brewing prowess.

The main producers in Pitts-
burgh brewing have historically

Today, the brewery has moved

The Penn Brewery got its start
in 1986, when it was instrumental
in bringing craft beer to Pennsyl-
vania, Cerminara said. Craft or

porations such as Budweiser and

Despite the relocation of two

of Pittsburgh’s distinguished beer
brands, there are still well-known,
local breweries that produce with-
in the city limits. One brewpub
is the Pennsylvania Brewing Co.
More commonly known as Penn
Brewery, it was built by the Ger-

where the beer is brewed. This
provides an unusual backdrop
before which to enjoy a genuine

Dave Cerminara, a brewer who
has been with Penn for about a

tion hasn’t changed much over
the years. “We’re all traditional,
everything,” he said, referring to

such as the Oktoberfest Bier and
the St. Nikolaus Bock.

Though Penn has expanded,

now distributing beer both in
bottles and on tap throughout the
country, its German authenticity
has not suffered. Cerminara said
what makes brewing in Pittsburgh
unique is the rivers’ pH levels.
“Our water is like, dead on with
Munich’s water,” he said, which
means that it doesn’t need to be
modiﬁed in order to produce a
true German-style beer.

Other craft breweries have
emerged in Pittsburgh more re-
cently, particularly in the 1990s,
when, according to East End
Brewery’s Scott Smith, the post-
Prohibition brewing scene began
to surface in new ways. “In the
’90s, when the brewpub craze kin-
da hit, there was this buzz about
beer that had ﬂavor,” he said.

With a background in mechani-
cal engineering, Smith started East
End Brewing about seven years

ago. “I had been home—brewing'

for about eight or nine years,
and like everybody who’s brewed
a batch of beer at home, there’s
that little voice in your head that
says, ‘Hey, maybe I can do this for
a living.’” So he made the move
from San Francisco to Pittsburgh.
“I decided to quit my day job, and
then start working on a business
plan, which is not the sequence I
recommend,” he joked.

n any given day in South Oakland,
0 students hit the streets in boots,

boat shoes and Birkenstocks. But

those little piggies, making walkers

home.

Despite
sometimes , being
short on cash, Pitt stu-
dents might want to rethink

skimping on supportive shoes. Feet bear
the weight of the entire body, so problems
with feet can radiate, causing knee, hip
and back pain.

Regularly wandering the streets of
Oakland in unsupportive shoes can cause
bunions, hammertoes, calluses and most
foot complications, said Dr. William Lenz,
a podiatrist at the Waterfront Surgery
Center.

“Your body tries to compensate for
the pain in your foot by trying to adjust
your posture to take the pain away from

  
 
  
 

your foot, and when you do that, you can
torque your hips and cause other prob-
lems. A lot of my patients complain about
their knees,” Lenz said.

One of the common foot ailments,
plantar fasciitis, creates a chain of pain.
Caused by aninflammation of the, tissue
band stretching from the heel to the toes,
symptoms includepain on the bottom of
the foot, pain that increases while stand-
ing and pain that increases over

surfaces in un-
supportive shoes.
“An excessively
high heel and a thin
sole lead to problems.
Style and function need
Lenz said. He recommended
wearing athletic shoes——— spe-
ciﬁcally running shoes — since
they offer the most support. But
he added that putting supportive
insoles in shoes also helps.
Not just any running shoe will do,
though. .

Fleet Feet Sports Pittsburgh, a spe-
cialty shoe store, encourages getting mea-
sured, knowing your gait, and ﬁnding out
what level and type of support you need.
See the “Shoe Fit” and “Walking” sidebars
to get the jargon down.

“It prevents injury and reduces the risk
of injury. The different types of stability
are going to help with keeping the body
injury-free,” said Megan McKinley,_ a ﬁt
professional at Fleet Feet.

There are three main types of running
shoes: cushioning, stability and motion
control. REI, the outdoor specialty store,
has an expert advice section of its website
that recommends different shoe types
depending on a user’s stride or gait (see
sidebar). REI recommends cushioning
shoes for runners that mildly pronate or

‘supinate, stability shoes for mild or mod-

erate overpronators and motion control
shoes for those who experience severe

overpronation.

According to REI, arch shape is related
to level of pronation. Pronators tend to
have a low arch, overpronators tend to be
flat—footed, and supinators tend to have
high arches. Shoe last, or shape, also plays
a role in ﬁnding the right ﬁt. Semi-curved
lasts are best for pronators, straight lasts
are appropriate for overpronators, and
curved lasts work best for supinators.

McKinley stresses the importance of
knowing how you walk and run so you

   
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
   

 
    

It also important to consider ' V
terrain. City walkers andrunners
beneﬁt most from road running
shoes because they are designed for ‘
pavement and are light and ﬂexible. Trail
running shoes are better suited for off-
road running. They»‘havethicker outsoles
and offer more stability and traction for
running in places where there are rocks,
holes and mud.

And -even if you’re
biking instead of
walking, shoes
count. Biking shoes
are less difficult l
as far as trying

fit. There are
three main
varieties
of biking
shoes ac-
cording
to the

«C a — sual—r«-idingl shoes
are for the occasional rider
who -travels ﬁve miles or less. These
shoes -are easy to walk in asiweli as cycle.
Mofunta.iin-biking shoes offer a stiffer sole
and have lots of tractionfor walking on
trails. Road— cycling shoes have the stiffest
soles and the least amount of cushion-
ing; they aren’t suitable for—wa,lkingi-long
distance-s. _  A

Not everyone lives his or her life in

   
  

athletic shoes though, and many popu-
lar shoes do not offer much in the way
of support. But there are ways to make
fashionable footwear a better ﬁt.

f‘Inserts help alleviate discomfort. You
can even put them in Uggs,” McKinley
said. _ _ , A ’

Insoles help to alleviate some of
the discomfort that normal shoes can
impose. Aside from insoles, wearing‘
the right socks can also improve com-
fort and fit. Fleet Feet recommends a

A reality check for Tim Tebow

; cussed and debated athlete in the ~

' The Denver Broncos’ second-

; year quarterback is now on a four- ‘
 game. winning streak and 5-1 as a,

- . . oiv .
grow and _
I country becomes more and more
divided-into Tebow haters and
Tebow lovers. You can count me
with the former.‘ ' y -
First, we can take a look at the
purely football side of it.
. Tebow is winning games. No-

body can take that away from him. ' _
But before hecame in, his team ~ :
was 1-3 and their only losses were .

to_ the Raiders, Titans and the
unstoppable Green Bay'Packers.
So the correlation between him

starting and the Broncos winning .

i-s deﬁnitely there -— but correla-
tion does not mean causation.

If the Broncos were still be-
ing led by Kyle Orton, who knows
where they would be right now.

It’s no secret Tebow isn’t actu-
ally playing that well. His comple-
tion percentage has never been
above 50 percent in a game and
he’s never thrown for more than
170 yards.

Secondly, look who Tebow has
beaten.

Nobody can take away the win
he had against the Jets. That was
a primetime, big—man perfor-
mance. But look at theentire list:
Miami Dolphins (3-8, winless at
the time), Oakland Raiders (7-4,
played them in Carson Palmer’s
ﬁrst start at quarterback), Kansas
City Chiefs (4-7, without star run-
ning back and starting quarter-
back), New Yorkjets (6-5, a good
win), and the San Diego Chargers
(4-7, in the midst of a six-game
losing streak).

When will Tebow really be
tested? I know he’s had a few
clutch scrambles, but they only
happen because he can’t stay in
the pocket and ﬁnd a receiver
downﬁeld.

his story unfolds, the

Tim Tebow (15) fires a completion against the Kansas City Chiefs.
Tebow has made a name for himselfby getting the win.

In the Broncos’ win against the
Chargers, he passed the ball 18
times and ran 22 times. Sounds
more like a gloriﬁed ‘running back
than a quarterback to me. 5

' Not only that, but after these
wins it’s not Tebow who should be
on the cover of every newspaper
and magazine — it’s his team’s
defense.

In his ﬁve wins (four of them by
a combined 17 points) the defense
has let up an average of 15' points.
If your offense can’t pull out wins

‘with those numbers, there are -

some serious problems.

In these defensively dominat-
ed games, Tebow is just boring to
watch. He’s rumbly, slow looking,
the opposite of graceful, and he’s
a lefty quarterback (yuck). Unlike
Cam Newton’s or Michael Vick’s,

Tebow’s athleticism never has.

that “wow” effect. He just looks
like a fullback running around
with his headcut off.

Even with all these things to
hate, the worst part about Tebow
is his cult-like fans. I mean,

these guys and gals really think,

D/l Cl (Tn 111 pus

this kid’s career is tantamount
to the second coming of Christ.
Sometimes it’s tough to handle.
Speaking of Christ, you can’t talk
about Tebow without discussing

his outward religious beliefs.

Let me clarify something: Peo-
ple don’t hate Tim Tebow because
he loves God. It’s just that in a
world full of hunger, global war-
fare, natural disasters, economic
downturns, child molestation
and disease, it’s tough to watch
Tebow pray on the sidelines that
Nick Novak will miss a 53-yard
game-winning ﬁeld goal to beat
the Broncos. ‘

Without getting into a’ theo-'

logical debate about where God
has his hand, I’m just trying to
explain the reasons people are
bothered by Tebow. It’s behavior
after games like Sunday’s — when
Tebow thanked God, instead of
Von Miller’s huge tackle for a loss
in overtime, for the Broncos’ vic-
tory.

But hey, if a quarterback this
bad is 5-1 as a starter, who am I to
doubt divine intervention? -”

 

FOOTBALL

 

Fourth—quarter  
struggles continue 

Roger Sepich
Staff Writer

The Pitt football team just hasn’t
been able to win the close games
this season. A

Friday’s 21-20 defeat in the Back-
yard Brawl at West Virginia was sim-
ply a case of history repeating itself
for the Panthers in 2011.

The game marked the fourth time
this season that Pitt — now 5-6 and
3-3 in the Big East — jumped out to
a double-digit lead, only to see it slip
away and result in a loss. Coach Todd

'Graham’s team led by 17 against

Iowa, 14 against Utah, 10 against
Cincinnati and 14 against West Vir-
ginia, yet lost all four games.

This weekend’s one-point mar-
ginof defeat also
takes the Pan-
thers’ record’ to
0-4 this season
in games decid-
ed by ﬁve points
or fewer.

“It hurts,”
sophomore de-
fensive tackle
Aaron Donald
said after the
West Virginia
game. “We had
it, but we just
couldn’t ﬁnish
it off.”

Most of the
team’s struggles , .
in crunch time
during close ~
games can be directly connected to
the offensive play and, ultimately, to
junior quarterback Tino Sunseri.

Since becomingthe starter at the
beginning of last season, Sunseri
has had seven opportunities to tie
or win a game by leading a scoring

 

I drive in the last ﬁve minutes of the

fourth quarter. Only once has he suc-
ceeded —— in a game against Utah in
his very ﬁrst start to begin the 2010
season. But Sunseri then threw an
interception in overtime that gave
Utah the win. -

The numerous sacks conceded in
late-in-the—game situations are the
main reason the offense hasn’t been
ableto sustain late drives.

......_.........“ ................
We had it, but
we just couldn’t
finish it off.
-Aaron Donald

99---—

“You can’t take sacks the last drive
of the game,” Sunseri said. “You have
to be able to get the ball out of your
hands and get it over to people, and
we just weren’t able to.”

But taking sacks is exactly what
Sunseri has done.

At West Virginia on Friday, Sun-
seri was sacked an incredible 10
times, including four times in the
last drive of the game alone.

“Puzzling, head—scratching, don’t
understand it,” Coach Graham said
when asked about the number of
sacks taken late in the game. “That’s
obviously not what we’re trying to
execute. It’s a two-minute situation,
and we practice it all the time. You
can’t take sacks, and we sat there and
just took one right after another.”

The offensive struggles have oc-
curred during
more than just
the ﬁnal, drive,
too. "‘_

In Pitt’s six
losses this sea-
son, the Pan-
thers have only
scored a com-
bined 10 points
in the fourth
quarter — a
mere ﬁeld goal
against Iowa and
a touchdown in
the blowout logs
to Rutgers.‘

For as poor
as the offense
has been, how-
. ever, Coach Gra-
ham said the defense has done more
than enough to win games. "I

' “Our defense has played well all
year long,” he said. “We are playing
so good in so many areas, and then
there are just a few areas which are
absolutely killing us.”

_ “It’s ﬁ1.istrating,” safety Andrgw
Taglianetti said. “But I think on
defense and special teams we did
our job, and that’s all I can speak
for because those are the only units
I’m on.”

Even the quarterback acknowl-

edged the lopsided performance fdl-_  .

lowing the West Virginia game. 
“Our offense let down our de-
fense,” Sunseri said. i

VOLLEYBALL  

Panthers
finish

‘season with
two losses

Torie Wytiaz

V The Pitt volleyball season came to an end

as the Panthers dropped two contests in

the Aztec Turkey Time Tournament held —

at _San Diego State this past weekend.
The weekend capped a series oflosses
for Pitt: After fall-ingtjo‘ Louisville 3-1’_in
the first round of the Big East tourna-
ment-, the Panthers traveled to California
over Thanksgiving Break to face teams
from the Mountain West Conference in
their final competition of the 2011 sea-
son. ‘ 1 5 .
gllnconsistent performance dogged the

Panthers in both losses, as their oppo- .
' nents capitalized on early leads in most

sets to keep the matches out of reach.

‘ Pitt head coach Toby Rens acknowledged

that the problems Pitt faced aga‘inSt‘7fe'XaS

   
   
 

“A lack of consistency has béenia p ob?
lem for.us thisyear,” Rens said. “Once7th’e

E ' opponent builds a large lead‘, it "is difficult

for us to come back.” .
TCU (-25—7) defeated the Panthers (18-

15) 3—1 with scores of 25423, 20225, 25-12 ,

a11Cl'’2'5--—18~.Fri~day night, in._.tl:Le~.ﬁ.r..$tc.of
Pitt’s two guaranteed matches. 5 A
The first two sets included competitive

' moments between the teams, resulting ‘

in 18 tiedscoresvand 10 lead changes. In
contrast, the final two sets saw just one
tie and one lead change, both occurring

_ in the fourth set.

In the opening set, the score was knot-
ted as late as 22-22, but the Frogs used
two kills and a Panther error to close out
the victory with a 3-1 run.

' The Panthers managed to reverse roles
with the Frogs in the second set —— they
controlled the game froma 15-15 tie and
put together a 10-5 run to tie the match
at one set per team.

However, the Frogs jumped out to early

leads in the remaining two sets, and the -

Panthers were unable‘ to recover as TCU
secured the match victory.

Offensively, Stephanie. Holland and
Yvonne Igodan of TCU led all players with
14 kills each while Pitt senior middle hit-
ter Kiesha Leggs paced the Panthers with
13.

The Panthers were out—hit 56-42 but
had three players ﬁnish with double—digit

dig figures.

Freshman Cassandra Congemi earned
17 digs, while fellow freshman Jessica
Wynn andjunior Alexa Campbell ﬁnished
with 11 and 10, respectively.

In their second match of the tourna-

ment, the Panthers faced host San Diego
State and once again fell in a 3-1 decision
with set scores of 25-20, 19-25, 27-25
and 25-22. ' _

San Diego State (18-10) also competes
in the MWC and earned its highest win
total in 2011 since its 18-14 campaign
in 2003. ' .

The Aztecs raced to a 16-6 lead in
the opening frame before the Panthers
battled back to Within three at the 20-23
mark. Nevertheless, the Aztecs earned

A the final two points with a kill and a

block. .

In the second set, the Panthers came
away with the set win, thanks to a .391
hitting clip and defensive efforts that
held the Aztecs to a .179 kill percent-
age. ‘ '
During the contest, Leggs led the Pan-
thers once again, contributing 17 kills
and eight blocks to the team’s efforts.

Leggs, the Panthers’ only Al1—Big East
selection finished the season with 117
total blocks, giving her the sixth spot on

House.

Pitt’s single-season blocking list.

For Leggs, such accolades are the cul-
mination of her overall efforts to help
her team in any way possible.

“I try not to pay too much attention
to records and statistics,” Leggs said. “I
just try to go out on the court and play
with an aggressive style that hopefully
results in a team victory.” t

Rens has been impressed with his se-
nior captain’s performance this season
and is not surprised that her play has
resulted in recognition.

“Kiesha.h_as been such an offensive
asset this year and her work ethic has
been inspiring to the rest of the team,”

Rens said. “She is truly deserving of all
the honors she receives.”

Despite Leggs’ match-high perfor-
mances, the Aztecs managed to win the
final two sets and the overall match.

While the Panthers ended their 2011
season with three consecutive losses,
Rens believes his team has gained a lot
of experience that will help its players
in the future.

With only two seniors on this year’s
roster, many freshmen and sophomores
saw significant amounts of playing time
early in their collegiate careers.

“We were the youngest team in the Big
East tournament this year,” Rens said.

“At one point we had five freshmen and
one upperclassman on the "court. Going
forward, we will be able to draw upon
this experience of high-level competition
that many young players do not have.”

Freshman outside hitter Wynn —- who
earned two double-doubles in kills and
digs in her final three matches —— agreed
with her coach and has high expectations
for next season.

“Every match helps us learn what We
need to do to become better,” Wynn said.
“As young players we got a taste of in-
tense competition, and when we come
back next year, we will only be hungrier
and more prepared to face it.” I
