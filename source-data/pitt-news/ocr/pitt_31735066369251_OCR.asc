Judiciary
Votes No
Referendum

By FORREST BUFFENMYER
Pitt News Staff Writer

The Student Government Judic-
iary last night voted 5-0 at a special
meeting not to hold a referendum
on the proposed governance group
allocations amendment because the
amendment violates state law. _ '

Judiciary chairman -Steve Fend-
ler said the decision was based on
discussions with acting vice chan-
cellor for Student Affairs William
Markus and his assistant, Gary
Houston. .

Barb Klepic, president of the
Engineering Students Cabinet, the
governance group that ‘sponsored
the amendment, claimed the
amendment was not illegal. She
presented a petition to the
committee with 1,200 signatures
that she said showed student
dissatisfaction with the current
allocations process.

“There is too much politics in the
way allocations are handlednow.
We would like to see that all groups

Senators considering the nomin-
ation of Health Secretary designate
Dr. Gordon MacLeod questioned
him sharply Monday about his
changing positions on John Kane
Hospital.

MacLeod, a physician and
University of Pittsburgh professor,
had served as chairman of a task
force studying the hospital and had
opposed immediate implementa-
tion of a planto continue services in
four smaller facilities.

Moves On
Faulty Roof

By JEFF DUROSKO
Pitt News Staff Writer

Nine residents of Tower C’s 16th
floor must decide within the next
few days where they wish to live for
the rest of the winter term.

The university has ordered the
students to choose one of three
options, after a mandate by. the
Allegheny County Health Depart-
ment ordering the university to
repair the roof of Tower C within 30
days.

According to Donovan Hughes,
director of housing, the university
would be unable to fix the roof by
the health department’s deadline.
The problem with the students’
nine rooms is that water and dirt
leak into the rooms through the
ceiling because of the faulty roof.

“We’ve been unable to get— a
contractor to complete the rooﬁng
job to ours and the students’
satisfaction,” Donovan Hughes,
director of University '
said. “The weather is a big

administered and was being used
to fill political patronage jobs. The
following year, the state revoked
Kane’s license and, in 1977,
banned further admission. The
ban on admissions was lifted last
year.

Meanwhile, local officials have
picked alternate proposals for
replacing Kane with the “mini-

smaller nursing homes.

answers on MacLeod’s intentions.

Colleges Experience Trend Toward New Conservatism

By TERESA soxoi.

The new conservative trend of the 1970 s, according to
social scientists, economists, and political scientists, may
have far reaching consequences.

The idea of new conservatism in education seems to
focus on three areas: the belief that government doesn’t
have all the answers; more cynicism in the public mood;
and a new pragmatic or realistic attitude about jobs.

Dean Schulman of the College of Arts and Sciences
explained his view of new conservatism as it affects the
universities.

“First," he pointed out, “this is not old conservatism-

where one adheres to traditional methods and views. The
nation has sobered up because of a record of comparative
failure in the last 25 years or so to solve a tremendous

range of problems which include civil liberties, urban.

decay and a limping economy.”

Schulman pointed out that in “the 1950s and 60s, the
universities absorbed the optimism of a very exuberant
period. At that time, the universities were regarded as
great problem solvers and began to expand.”

The number of graduates also expanded so rapidly that

the economy grew to receive them, Schulman pointed out.

Part of a new conservative reaction stems from this,
Schulman said. '

“The universities are feeling the reaction to these views.
The feeling now is that universities are not equipped to
solve all problems and want to avoid entanglements in
immediate political concerns.”

Schulman added that the criticism of a university “as
just another social institution in a corrupt society is
unfair.”

Part of a cynicism in government and social institutions —

is reflected in what Dr. Jose Moreno, professor of
sociology, called a “general disinterest in political issues. ”

Terry Milani, associate director of the Ofﬁce of Student
Activities, spoke about voter participation in the recent
Student Government Board elections.

“Although voter’ participation in the last election
increased 20 percent through publicity efforts, new
directions are being looked at to make the 5GB more visible
with more visible impact on the lives of students,” Milani
said.

Kim Borden, president of the College Republicans,
stated that there is a general disinterest in political issues

at Pitt. “Most kids are interested in making good grades.
If academic students are involved with politics, it’s
probably because politics is involved in their academic ,
field.” ‘ -

‘Ted Nelson, head of College Young Democrats, said, .
“Students in general are more interested in academic
rather than political issues because they are more ‘
immediate to them.” ‘

Despite the mood or the belief that student government
and government in general do not have all the answers, the
major root of new conservatism in education is the .
pragmatic attitude about the job market.

New conservatism, or as it is sometimes called, new
pragmatism,. is evident in a student’s “instrumental
orientation,” said Moreno. “Students are worried about
getting ahead now because the competition is so hard.”

Because competition among students is so high, grades
have become important, he added.

“Now students question an exam question more often
than they’ll question a teaching method,” Moreno said.

On a ﬁnal note, Schulman added, “Students are

wondering why they came to college and we’re not good at
supplying answers.”

Only three students have taken
either of the two options aimed at
moving them from Tower C.
According to Hughes, two of the
residents have opted for the refund
while one has moved to Lothrop.

The students’ reaction is mixed.
Steve Fendler, who has not made
his ﬁnal decision yet, said, “The
waiver has a retroactive clause in it
that says that the university was

not be in the future for damage

very fair, especially in all the
choices given to the residents.

Recognizing

A   China

Vice premier Teng Hsiao-ping yesterday ended an
unprecedented eight day visit to this country—a trip
"the Chinese leader hoped would gain for his country,
among other things, a “most favored nation” trade
status with the United States.

/

At the same time, Carter administration members
defended the president's stand on China - Taiwan
relations before a sometimes mocking group of
Senate Foreign Relations Committee members.

Deputy Secretary of State Warren M. Christopher
and Defense Secretary Harold R. Brown tried to
break the brick wall of skeptical senators, led by
Idaho Sen. Frank Church and Jacob Javits of New
York, who fear a complete break with the Nationalist
government.

The Carter administration has already stated that
the United States “expected” China not to seek
reunification by force and defensive arms would con-
tinue to be sent to Taiwan. It would be ludicrous for
Carter to renege on such a statement. It would be

equally foolish for Congress to drag the new

arrangement through the political mud.

Normalizing relations with China has many
benefits. First, the trade of both/knowledge and

supplies has enormous potential. Second, relations I

with Russia, particularly in the field of armaments,
are still dragging. A United‘ States - China pact
would bring with it an added worry for the Soviets,
one which may bring about a quicker United States -

Soviet _pact. Third, and more important, China is a,

major power and it cannot be ignored forever. ‘

Senators who oppose the China pact are the same
ones who delayed the Panama Canal treaties for over

Page 4—Wednesday. February 7, 1979

a year, heightening tension between our government
and the Panamanians to the brink of a Latin
American revolt. Those treaties were inevitable.
Congress’ stubbornness only caused confusion.

In the same sense, relations with China are also
inevitable. Businessmen, technocrats and educators
have believed that for a long time. Carter must have
given it much thought before making his decision las
year. Now it is Congress’ turn. '

Speedy acceptance. of the treaty is necessary, at
least within the year. Delays and argument will only
keep each country in the dark and further tarnish the

pp image of a Congress already mired in red tape and

confusion.

Teaching and R esearch—-— Is There Room For Both ?

who parachuted from the 42nd floor

of the Cathedral to freedom! I‘
‘ seriously doubt that all

[Many schools are
experiencing declining enrollment
because students want a term or

«two off to think about their future.

I am not qualiﬁed to criticize the
administration at Pitt. However,
your concern for ‘quality education
strikes me as being peculiar: “Has
all this research at Pitt really
helped education here?” Why do
you suppose Watson and Crick
developed the DNA double helix;
just to have their names emblazon-
ed in textbooks? ,-

\It should be obvious to most
students that a facu1ty’s ‘research
pertains to highly progressive ideas
that eventually coagulate with

,_ other observations and terminate
(if possible) with a conclusion.'”This
W conclusion either obliviates an old

hypothesis or substantiates a new
perspective on the subject.

OK, so there seems to be a
method to their madness! Where
does that leave the student who
wants to learn the background
which leads to the researcher’s
paper? The students could either
live at Langley Library and read all
the past journals or go to a
university and have that professor
enlighten them on the subject. The
beneﬁts of learning directly from

_ -the professor is one reason we pay

I would like to focus attention to

uates. These are very impression-
able years for 18-year-olds and
19-year-olds. Let us
Chemistry 11 and 12, Biology 11

These are absolutely useless
introductory courses ﬁlled with
verbal garbage. For those
professors that teach them, I
suggest they redirect the focus of
these courses so that. they do
introduce the students to the ﬁeld
they are interested in.

One method to do this would be
to make more v apparent those

practical applications with which

Therefore, an undecided student
attending an introductory course
should be able to justify his interest
in pursuing that major. Fortunate-
ly, I acclimated to the rigors of my
intro biology courses and compen-
sated for my losses in invertebrate
biology, biochemistry, and devel-
opmental biology.

It is time to take the bull by the
horns and require that the
professors with whom the students

are dissatisﬁed (a handful of
experienced students can evaluate
professors’ performances) either
develop an improved attitude for
classroom lectures or resign
themselves to research. '

Those that are effective lecturers
should receive some bonus by the
university because they are divert-
ing their time from their career-
research. This is one person’s idea,
which, if implemented, would limit
only ' talented lecturers in the

classroom. From here on, it would
be the students’ responsibility to
read required texts and attend
classes and show the teachers we
really can learn some things!

We must be decisive now! Let

wants to say “I’m mad as hell and
I’m not going to take it anymore.”
He’s right too. The bureaucracy of

Crossing S w ords Again

Last year Jerry Miller wrote a
blazing letter to The Pitt News
charging that his Chem 12 course
was impossibly hard and resulted
in a large fraction of D and F
grades. I replied then that the facts
did not bear him out. Chemistry 12
had a very normal grade distribu-
tion. -

In The Pitt News of Jan. 31,
Miller unleashes a more general
attack on teaching at Pitt. I will
cross swords with him again, in a
Pavlovian. response, but only
regarding his two remarks on
chemistry courses: “Another tactic
(that Chem 11 and 12 students are
all too familiar with) is making a
course so impossibly difﬁcult that
everyone does poorly. ...Because
some chemistry courses are design-
ed to give F or D grades to the
majority of students. (And I've
been told this by surprisingly high
sources)."

Alas, the ‘record speaks other-
wise: In the six lecture sections of
Chemistry 11 and 711 for 1978, the
average F rate was 7.6 percent
(ranging from 4 to 9 percent) and
the average D rate was 9.8 percent

(ranging from 4 to 14 percent).
Furthermore, A and B grades were
earned by 44.3 percent of the
Chemistry 11/711 students.
During the same period the ﬁve

Chem 12/712 sections produced an '

average F rate of 7.3 percent
(ranging from 4 to 15 percent) and
an average D rate of 12.2 percent
(ranging from 6 to 16 percent). Of
the 1978 Chemistry 12/712 stu-
dents, 45.7 percent earned A or B
grades. Thank God we failed
miserably in our “design to give F
or D grades to the majority of
students”.

Grade distributions are a matter
of open record and there is really
no reason for Mr. Miller to go to
“surprisingly high sources” for
his misinformation. We are
genuinely sorry that anyone might
do poorly in Chemistry 11 or 12 but
chemistry is a demanding as well
as an exciting science. Even so,
the Ds and F5 are in a small
minority.

Watership Down
Directed by Martin Rosen

The general belief among
moviegoers is that a ﬁlm is usually
not as good as the stuff from which
it is made i.e., the original novel. In

‘ short, the sum is less than its parts.

Martin Rosen’s adaptation of

Richard Adams’ ‘‘Watership

. Down” is a perfect example of this.

Rosen, who produced, wrote and

, directed this ﬁlm version of‘ the

famed bestseller really had his
hands full. First of all, the novel

runs in excess of 400 pages. A‘

picture may be worth a thousand
The
last novel of this length that was
successful at the box ofﬁce was
“The Godfather,” and even here,
when its sequel was made, it was

able to use a full third of the book, _

as yet unﬁlmed._

Next, the film runs a little under
90 minutes=in length. One could
excuse its rather serious omissions
if it ran over two hours, and the
director began cutting. But not in
this case.

In the beginning we are given a
sort of Genesis wherein the origins
of the rabbits are presented in the
rabbit point of view (the sun, Frith,
made the first rabbit, El-ahrairah).
Throughout the ﬁlm, situations and

characters are presented in this
way, which makes the ﬁlm more
interesting. (For example, the dog
and cat that appear later are
pictured as ferocious and ominous.)

Shortly thereafter, we learn of
the plot. Fiver, a clairvoyant rabbit
given to ghastly visions, sees
imminent death for all those in his
warren of Sandleford. Owlsa, a

"small village of tunnels where the

rabbits stay. The rabbits spend a
good deal of the ﬁlm reaching what
Fiver considers to be their perfect
home. Upon their arrival theyjmeet
Kehaar, a wounded seagull, and
learn of the neighboring warren of
Owslafa, led by General Wound-
wort, who runs it like a military
camp.

Here is where the omissions
come in. Where are the rabbits
known as Strawberry, Acorn,
Bluebell, Hawthorne (to name but
afew)? J What happens to Fiver,
Kehaar? A ‘

Those who have read the book
know what happens, but the
moviegoer will go away confused.

The ﬁlm progresses well through
the ﬁrst hour, with a lot of beautiful
and somehow realistic animated
landscapes really keeping. the
viewer’s attention.

The soundtrack is also beautiful,

_ especially in a good theater likethe

King"s Court, where‘ the music,

ENTERTAINMENT ‘

voices and background noises

surround you in a realistic fashion.~

The song “Bright Eyes,” per-
formed by Art Garfunkel, comes at
a truly sad time in the ﬁlm and
helps to accentuate this particular
scene.

However, the ﬁnal third of the
ﬁlm is very choppy and jumpy.
Unlike the novel, there is no real
resolution, and the viewer some-
how feels that he has fallen asleep;
that a piece is missing fromqthe
film, or that there is some sort of
symbolism in this lack of a good
explanation.

The animation is good through-
out, rather reminiscent of Ralph
Bakshi’s “Wizards" of several
years ago.

And the ﬁlm has’ some social
comment, although once again not
nearly as much as the novel. At
one point, when Fiver learns of the
death of his old warren (as he had
predicted) owing to men ﬁlling in
the holes, he says, “They’ll never
stop until they’ve spoiled the
earth.” .

But besides all this, “Watership
Down” is still not the kind of ﬁlm to
go and see with no prior
knowledge. Good advice: ,. stay
home and read the book. If you like
it, then go see the film. This way
you’ll at least ‘know what’s going
on. A

‘Ice Castles’ Built on Johnson’s Performance

Ice Castles
Directed by Donald. Wrye

How would you react if you made
it big and suddenly, through some
strange accident, went blind?
Would you give up on every thing‘
you had going for you or try to
make something of your life again?

Lexi Winston, played by Lynn-
Holly Johnson, faces that situation
in the ﬁlm “Ice Castles.”

Much like the present wave of
sex-selling television programs
such as “Three’s Company” and
“Flying High,’.’ “Blondes Have

boyfriend, believe Lexi is talented
enough to win the sectionals.

Clearly, it’s Lexi all the way-for
everyone, that is, except the
judges. Lexi’s failure to win,
however, is offset by a break-
through in her life.

Lexi Winston is ‘chosen to train
for the Olympics. Through some
heavy publicity by her new coach,
Miss Markland (Jefﬁfer Warren)
and newscaster Brain Dockett, she
soon becomes the Cinderella of the

is providing it—cold, cheap sex
thrown at his fans like ice water.

“Do Ya Think I’m Sexy?” is the
classic tale of the one night stand.
This number, with its trendy disco
beat, is best left for play during
noisy, crowded parties where no
one will hear the lyrics and where a
heavy beat for dancing is all that
counts.

“Dirty Weekend” is sex-on-
wheels, a play-by-play account of a
weekend in Mexican hay, complete
with quaaludes. Stewart‘ has 1118
horns out here, decked out in full
regalia.

The next tune on side one,
“Ain't Love A Bitch,” is a
complete reverse from the previous
action-packed tunes.

This is a sweet lament to
Stewart's Maggie and to his
innocence lost at 17. The beat is

soft and the lilting guitar work is
adequate and pleasant.

Even more of a turn-around is
“The Best Days Of My Life.” This
time Stewart thanks his lover for
patience, good times, trust and

nation-America’s hopeful for the
Olympic gold.

Tragedy, however, strikes in a
cruel way. A freak accident, wholly
unforseeable, occurs, leaving Lexi
blind. _ ‘

What follows is a moving story of
human nature—-Lexi’s emotional
struggle to be what she could have
been. S

“Ice Castles” has its sad
moments and its joyful ones.“ The
end leaves you believing in the
moral of the ﬁlm: Don't give up
without trying——a lesson learned

love. Particularly ﬁne are Gary
Gerbig on flute and Paulinko da
Costa and Tom Vig on percussion.

“The Best Days of My Life” is
reminiscent of Stewart’s earlier
releases; when he wasn’t so
wordly. It is the best track on the
album.

“Is That The Thanks I Get?” is
mediocre, although Stewart’s voice
hits the rough-edged notes he is
famous for more consistently here
than on the album‘s other cuts.

It appears Stewart is displaying
the hurt he must have experienced
when he was sued for $15 million
by his ex-lover, starlet Britt
Ekland. Ekland should get a good
laugh of this; no one else should
bother listening.

On side two, Stewart is back to
his “sex for sale” motiff.
“Attractive Female Wanted” is a
classiﬁed ad for a quick hop in /bed.
It’s too bad saxophonist Tom Scott.
late of the L.A. Express and the
Blues Brothers’ “Briefcase Full Of
Blues", wastes his talents on this

_ number.

the hard way by both Nick and
Lexi. ‘

“Ice Castles” revolves around
two teenagers, causing it possibly
to have limited appeal. But its
positive aspects should prevent
that.

The ﬁlm possesses an excellently
scored soundtrack. by the highly-
regarded Marvin Hamlisch, com-
poser of the scores for many
Barbara Streisand movies. The title
song, sung by Melissa Manchester,
is already in the Top 40. b

of Rock

The title track attempts to be a S

snappy, early 1960’s rock’n’roll

number, but the beat drags and the .

horn section of Scott, Phil Kenzie
and Steve Madaio is weak. .
“Last Summer" is nearly as
good'as “The Best Days of My
Life.” Again, Herbig’s ﬂute is

excellent and the percussion good.-

In‘ fact, this moderately paced
tune proves that Stewart is at his
best on this album when his songs
are uncomplicated, his lyrics subtle
and his voice not strained through
poor imitations of rough-and-tough
rock’n’rollers.

Fans of the original “Standing in
the Shadow of Love” should not
listen to Stewart’s version.
Actually, no one should listen to it.

To wrap up the album, “Scared
and Scarred" is a slow piece with
good piano by Duane Hitchings.
However, the song does not meet
the standard set by “The Best Days
Of My Life" because it drags a bit.

Blondes, brunettes and redheads
would have more fun if they
skipped this album and listened to
some of Stewart’s work.

By ANGELE ELLIS

When Bill Hebda’s Oakland land-
lord balked at renting an apartment to
male college students, Bill and his
roommate produced a persuasive
reference——from their previous land-
lady.

‘‘I think that convinced him,” said
Bill, a junior chemistry major who
shares a furnished, two-bedroom

V apartment on McKee Place.

.His current apartment, on -the first
floor of a duplex also occupied by
nurses and female students, was
“the nicest" product of a two-month
search, Bill said. He and his room-

V mate consulted Off-Campus Housing

listings and newspaper ads, contac-
ted’ about 15 apartments by phone,
and looked at half before taking one
advertised in The Pittsburgh Press.
Bill and his roommate then
established a joint bank account to
pay apartment expenses. Each con-
tributes $150 a month for rent and
utilities and $50 a month for food.

S “Most of the money we use—even

for an occasional dinner out--comes
from that‘account,’.’ Bill said.

O Housework is split equally bet-
ween the two men, Bill said, although
his roommate‘ “is more of a chef than I
am."

“After living in a single room in the
dorms (Lothrop Hall) for threeterms, I
found the idea of living with someone
challenging," Bill continued. “You
have to learn to be considerate of
others. My roommate and l have our
arguments, but we’ve learned to live.
with each other.”

Bill decided to stay in Oakland not

just because of its proximity to Pitt,

but because he “would have out too

many ties with people if I moved out’

of Oakland.” Bill and his roommate
conduct a Christian fellowship of local
college students in their apartment on
Wednesday nights, and Bill said he is
part of a “community” that would be
difficult to establish off-campus.
Although he likes the freedom,

H privacy and [space of an apartment,

Bill pointed out several problems of
renting, in Oakland and elsewhere.
“Landlords try to take advantage
of students, because in a sense they
have them at their mercy,” he said;
“I've learned to be assertive. For in-

stance, our landlord's son is putting .

an apartment in the basement of the
‘house, and it's very noisy—too noisy
to study. l asked the landlord to give
us advance notice when his son was
coming. It caused some unpleasan-
tness,,.but he respected our wishes.”
Subtleties . of a lease can be
overlooked if one does not read it
carefully, Bill said. “Our lease says
we have storage space in the
basement. lf the landlord puts an
apartment there, he must provide us
with other storage space.” be
As an experienced apartment

 

dweller, Bill said he would never /

make the mistake of living without a
lease—as he did in his first apartment,
where he “got along well with the
landlady, and just never got around to
signing a lease.” That apartment was
destroyed by fire last summer, when
it was unoccupied. ‘

“With my first apartment, I had the
attitude, ‘This.isn’t the greatest, but
what can you do?’ " Bill concluded.
“Now, l wouldn't think that. l’d look

 

around."

**k**V§*'k'&I'i

Carol Teno wanted a place by.her-
self with no roommates, close to
campus,‘and not too expensive. Her
solution? A single room in alarge
house. »

For $120 a month, Carol rents a
furnished, bedroom-sized area in a
15-room, house on North Dithridge
Street, and has access a to three
bathrooms and a basement laundry
room-kitchen. “l have a sense of‘
autonomy while staying close to
campus," the senior history major
said. ‘‘I’m also living with real people
in the real world. A little more than
half the tenants here (10 men_ and
five women) are students. They're
older, more mature, and do a range of
things.” --

‘fl enjoy living with students——it
provides intellectual stimulation,” said"
Bruce Amber, a 23-year-old draf-
tsman. “Here I can be with people if.l
want to, but I don’t have to."

V “lt's quieter“ and less crazy here
than in the dorms, and we have free
parking,“ said Dennis Nevinsky, a
graduate student in social work.
“Everything you need is here.”

Sharing a kitchen and baths
promotes a sense of community in
the house, Carol said, but also poses
a problem. “There’s a collective non-
responsibility “for keeping the
bathrooms clean,” she said, and their

griminess proves her statement. Her
landlord cleans the kitchen, maintains
the fire escape, and removes gar-

bage.
Another drawback is the smallness
of the kitchen. ‘‘I like to cook a lot,”

said Carol, “butthe lack of storage .

means I can’t do much."
Carol said she considers North
Oakland a ’ fairly safe neigh-
borhood—“there’s someone around
all the time”——and that most of the
are

  
     

 

 

“nice and helpful.”
"And there's no roaches here.
None,” she said

****&**t**_

June Blender lives alone in
Squirrel Hill, and prefers it that way,

‘‘It was important for _me to get
away from campus,” said June, a
senior majoring in philosophy and
history and philosophy of science.
“When you live in the dorms, you
start to think’ the whole world goes to
school. i ’

“Squirrel Hill, is a nice, family
neighborhood, a place with roots,”
June continued. “lt also has a Giant
Eagle, three bakeries, a» butcher*s,
pizza shops, specialty stores.
There’s a lot more variety.”

Her apartment on Hobart Street, a
large, furnished two-bedroom on the
first floor of a house, is “like my own
home," June said. “Having my own
place makes me feel like less of a
transient.”

The other tenants of June's apar-

tmenthouse are graduate students ’

and families. She described theat-
mosphere as “much quieter than the
dorms—you don’t have to put up with
things like stereos blasting disco.”
Although she looked at several
apartments through Off-Campus
Housing last fall, the apartment June
ended up taking was recommended
by a friend. She moved fromthat

-$155 a month apartment to her

electric.

Her landlord, a Carnegie-Mellon
professor, responded promptly when
her heat went _off this winter, June
said. Other problems included having

~a phone installed and getting a
correct meter reading from Duquesne
Light Company. “You should. never
be afraid to challenge utility com-
panies-—large companies often make
mistakes,” she added. W

/

Transportation is a major
drawback and expense for June, who
relies on buses to go to her part-time

,.job -in a downtown restaurant as well
as to class. '‘‘I have to leave 45
minutes to an hour before I'm sup-

’ V posed to be someplace. Sometimes!

can't stand the thought of waiting for
a bus in the cold. But the problem is
outweighed by the advantages of
getting away." , e

The security risk in “getting away”

‘does not bother June unduly, she'_

said. ‘‘If l’m‘too scared to go out, in a
sense I've already been raped. I
don’t go looking for troub|e—l think
it's very important to get a. sense of
your neighborhood, and where it's
safe to walk at night——but if you’re
afraid, you can't live alone. I force
myself not to be afraid.”

Living alone has made, June more
self-disciplined, she said. “There's

,no one to nag me about work, laundry »-

or going out——l have to do everything
myself. I have learned to go places
alone, and to enjoy being alone." L
Despite herenjoyment of _living
alone, June, who will graduate in
December, is looking for a “quiet,
clean person who likes privacy” to
share her apartment and expenses.
‘‘I know I’m difficult to livel
with—and I'm going to be picky,” she
said. “But I've also learned sha_ring is
a value as important as self-reliance.

. Another ‘person can help you bring

things back into perspective after a

_ bad day.”

"*4a*c*

Sue Baesch feels she must ex-
plain when she introduces someone
to her roommate. “I keep on saying
‘we're just friends,’ ” said the junior
psychology major, who shares a
_Shadyside_ apartment‘ with Steve
Dumolt, a graduate student in 'met-
talurgy at Carnegie-Mellon. ‘‘It’s a lit-
tle weird when some guy asks me
out."

Sue felt “weird" herself when she
moved into an Oakland ,house with
Steve and another male roommate
over a year ago She had just retur-

nedto Pittsburgh from California,‘ Pa.‘ A

3,,

  Communal;

and had no one to live with when she

answered their newspaper ad. for a
roommate. Despite initial em-

I barassment'(“l never went around in

my bathrobe”). Sue became com_ffor-
table enough with the arrangement to
move with Steve to Shadyside last fall
when the third roommate left the city.

“We get along welI—we have
enough in common to make life
pleasant, and we ignore each other
the rest of the time,” she said.

The two split the $285 a month
rent on their unfurnished ‘two-
bedroom apartment on Fifth Avenue,
as well as the $100 a month they
spend on food. ‘‘I like to cook, so I
end up doing it a lot,” said Sue, ad-
ding that the distribution of
housework “works out evenly in the
long run. We let things go until one of

us decides to do them.”

Grocery shopping. is easier
because Steve has a car, Sue said,

“I wouldn’t have moved out here if I"-

didn’t have access to a car."
Despite her building’s size (36
units), Sue said she feels safer there

* than she would in the dorms. The

building has four separate entrances
and security doors; her apartment
has a deadbolt lock and a peephole.

1 “Most of the people living here are

families, and there’s a family feeling
to the place,” said Sue. ‘‘I also feel

safer living with man.”

Being students and unmarried did
not cause problems with their land-
lord, Sue said. “l_n this building‘,
everyone pretends there isn’t a land-
lord. Many people have cats, even
though the lease forbids it. The
building superintendent is nice, but
he isn't around a lot. Our hall railing

-has been down for six months.”

' Taking an unfurnished apartment
did pose a problem, however, Sue
said. Steve’s family donated enough
furniture to fill the apartment, but Sue
and Steve had to transport it to Pit-
tsburgh from Oklahoma.
Distance from campus is the main
difficulty ofliving in Shadyside , ac-
cording to Sue. “I sometimes feel

confined," she said. “There’s not a I‘

lot to do Ahere—no park, _ no
movies-—and I hate waiting for a bus.
I try to get Steve to pick me up if I
have to be out late. It ‘can be
depressing.” “ -

“When the Intercultural House
was set up in 1969, the Watts and
Chicago riots
everybody’s minds, as well as the
issueof interracial-—and thus inter-
culturaI——re|ations,” said resident
director Tim Kendall, in explaining the
phenomenon of the Intercultural
House, which provides a place for
students of different races and
nationalities to live, eat and work
together.

, Ideally, the population of the big
house on North Dithridge Street is 25
percent and 75 percent American,
with 50 percent of the Americans
being black, Kendall said. This term,

7 of the, 21 (six women, 15 men) .

residents are foreigners—including a
Nigerian and an Egyptian: ,

All but five residents are graduate
students at Pitt;‘ four are Pitt un-

I dergraduates, and one“‘is a Carnegie-

Mellon undergrad.

“Emphasis now is on intercultural
relations in everyday living, although
in the past IC residents did such
things as travel for a summer to
Africa," said Kendall. He is in the
process of organizing house lectures

' 7. on prisons and on the problems of

minority businesses, Kendall added.
The Gertrude Stein Foundation, a
private foundation set up with a por-
tion of the legacy of the late writer,
owns the house and contributes its
$4,000 annual income to maintaining

- and operating it. The remainder of

the house expenses are paid by
students. A double room costs $594
per term; a single room $794 per
term. Five catered dinners per week
are included in the fee. There are five
single rooms and eight doubles, and
the occupants of double rooms are
paired with roommates of another
race or nationality. Students are
allowed to live in the ‘house one
year.

room, laundry room, and a bathroom
on each floor. Housework is shared
by the students; .a weekly chore chart
and daily kitchen chart prepared by
Kendall divide duties equitably.

“This Year, it's been more of a
community than I expected," said
Kendall. “You'd think that there
would be more personality conflicts
among people of widely differing

- ages and levels of education.”

“People self-select themselves for

a house like this,” said Rosemary "

Kenda_ll, Tim’s_ wife. Those who
.want privacy realize this is not the
place for them."

Some IC residents were solicited
by brochure; others became aware of
the house through Off-Campus
Housing. -

‘Leona Tompkin, a student in‘the
Graduate School of Public- and Inter-

national Affairs, “thought the house

sounded good in the brochure,”
when she came to Pittsburgh from
California. ‘‘I really like people, and I
couldn't have met as many other-

wise,” shesaid. ‘‘It would be hard on
an introvert, though. I also like the

distance from campus.

“You meet some interesting ,’

people here,” said Fountain'Bailey-
Murray, a student in Pitt's Graduate
School of Business. “This was one
of the first places I came to when I

filled and a waiting list’ of 660

students was established.

Many students placed on the

until Feb. 17, one full day_ after the
housing quota had been reached,
Others complained the gsystem was
unfair to students unable to stand in
l_ine because of academic or work
committments. ‘ _
The room lottery system was
proposed in early November and was
met by strong opposition from most
-of the residerrt population.

“We have waited in .|ine—for
registration and for payment of bills
_ before at this ~University——we are
' prepared to handle one more line for
the sake of renewing our housing
contract,” a petition, signed "by
2,889 resident students protesting
the lottery system, said.

The students presented this
petition to Bill Markus, acting Vice

Thanksgiving vacation.

Markus repeatedly stated his ad-
minstration would never accept the
status quo system of room selection
for another year. “It (the first come,
first served room selection method)
was found to. be a bad situation,”
Markus said. “The amount of public
relations work we had to do with parts
and with students was enormous, as
well as the bad will that it created for
A the University.” _
One housing administrator said
because the allotted spaces were

ministration feared some sort of mass
hysteria might be created this-year by
students standing in line. One major
concern, he said, was that these
students mightbe injured by other
students pushing to get ahead

sophomores and the remaining 40
percent to freshmen, regional cam-
pus transfer students, relocating
students, transfer students, com-
muters and graduate students (in that
order). , 

Residents protested this form of
the lottery primarily because they
believed it discriminated on the basis
of class. After weeks of debate bet-
ween administrators and students the
present system of lottery by gender
was accepted.

Under this system, 53 percent of
allavailable housing will go to females
and 47 percent to males. This
breakdown is proportionate to the
number of males and females pre-
sently living in the dorms.

Under this system, room'reten--

tion and room bidding will remain the
same as in past years. -

This year, any female drawing a
number between 1 and 1098 and

any male drawing a number between.

1 and 838 will be eligible for‘Univer-

Lori Falsetti, a freshman nursing

taken into consideration, such as

As chain restaurants go, Red Bull
inn is better than most, but the margin
of_ difference is not very large.
However, its food does not warrant
the’30-plus minute wait for a table.
The refusal to take reservations is a
definite mistake, as the number of
would-be diners walking out almost
equals the number willing to wait.

Redolent with imitation wood and
Z-brick, the restaurant looks
somewhat like the English country inn
it tries to. resemble. A pleasant
waitress greeted us after we were
seated, and served our drinks with a
punctuality unusual for such a busy

‘time. The Tom Collins ($1.50) was

pleasantlytart and correctly made.
The Red Bull menu is short and
unadventurous, with seafood and
beef selections and combinations
thereof. Lamb or pasta is not to be
found, and only one veal and two

. lonely chicken entrees are available.

Included in the menu are lobster

itail($11.95), baked stuffed crab
($38.45), prime ribl$9.75) surf and 

turf ($14.95) and a few sandwiches.
Every entree is accompanied by
bread and butter, a choice of potato
or vegetable of the day, and a visit to
the copious soup and salad bar.

The onion soup was adequate,

though slightly weak and full of un-

dercooked onions. Beef barley also
was available. Salad makings
abounded, with lots of fresh greens,

well-aged, but was too long from the
oven. It would have been better on a

raw vegetables and garnishes, and a
choice of‘ five dressings. Also

available were jello, macaroni, three

bean and potato salads, and
coleslaw. The salad plates, however,

‘ , were warm and so large as to en-,

courage overeating. , c\ . V

day was buttered cauliflower; very

The French fried shrimp ($7.95)
were correctly served- with tails‘in—‘
tact, accompained by lemon and
cocktail sauce. A small loaf of warm,

wonderful bread and a pot of whipped
butter was a nice addition to the dish.

Timing during the_ meal was per-
fect. Enough time was allotted for
each course, and the entrees arrived
right after we, finished our salads.
Dessert selections were pitifully few,
but the cheescake ($1.50) was light
and *r10‘t too sweet. Coffee was hot,
but slightly bitter due to repeated
heating or bad brewing. Chartreuse
($2) was a definite ‘mistake,
almost ancient, very sweet and
bearing no. hint of its 110-proof
power.

At $17.28, including tip, the
check made us wish we had gone
somewhere else. Without alcohol,
the tab would have been around

‘$13 for one, including tax and tip.

_, One can reach the Red Bull by
catching a 76 Hamilton on Forbes
Avenue, taking it’ to Fifth and Shady
Avenues, crossing Fifth and walking
one block along Shady. There are
Red Bulls in Carnegie, Dormont, Nor-
th Hills, Penn Hills and Pleasant Hills,
all equally mediocre.

    Confucian Philosophy Inspires Classroom

By MARY JANE MCKEEVER

“In archery we have something like
the way of the superior man. When
the archer misses the center of the
target, he turns round and -seeks for

g the cause of his failure within him-

self. ” — Confucius

Chinese students at local univer-
-sities played an important role in the
establishment of the Chinese
Classroom. _ 1.
A committee composed of
Chinesestudents from the Univer-

I , sity, Carnegie Institute of Technology
(now C-MU), Duquesne University"
_ and of representatives" from the local

Chinese community was organized in

late 1929. A graduate student in

chemistry at Pitt became chairman.
The room was patterned after a

hall in a palace in the Forbidden City,

Peking. lts 18th-century Empire
design originated with Teng Kwei, a
Chinese, artist who was, in 1929, at-
tending the Harvard School of Fine
Arts.

Built for the most part in the late A

1930s, the room was funded through
appeals to Chinese communities in
A erican cities. The On Leong Mer-
chants Association, then a powerful
group, sponsored the committee’s
treasurer as she travelled throughout

the United States. The Chinese
National Government donated»
$5,000.

Over 30 centuries of Chinese

\ culture are represented in the

classroom. The room emphasizes
Confucius, “The Great Teacher,” as
well as the diversity and richness of
Chinese symbolism. The likeness of
K’ung-Fu-Tze (Confucius), carved in-
to the slate panel of the west wall,
dominates the room. The portrait
was copied from a stone rubbing of
the original likeness by Wu Toi-Tzein
the Confucian Temple in Shantung
Province, birthplace of the sage. '

character marking the 12 qualities of
an educated person. An educated
person should know six arts: etiquet-
te,’ music, archery, chairioteering,
calligraphy and mathematics. When

, he has attained these arts, he must

master four principles: to make his
feelings sincere, to set his mind on
righteousness, to cultivate his per-
sonality, to regulate his family. Then
come the crowning achievements: to
govern his country and to tranquilize
the world.

ln.the center of the room's painted
ceiling, on a lifted plane, coils the
five-clawed « imperial dragon,
surrounded by clouds. Different
animal parts compose the
dragon: it has the body of a snake,
scales of a fish, ’claws of an eagle,
head of a lion and horns of a goat.
The dragon, in Chinese symbolism, is
the animal of the. sky, representing
clouds and rain. It is a symbol of
water and the productive force of
nature.

Of the 40 ceiling" cazettas in the
room, eight bear formalized ancient

Chinese characters that denote the’

eight virtues of right living. They are
filial piety, brotherhood, loyalty, sin-
cerity, courtesy, integrity, less of

material possession and more of ser-

vice, and modesty.

Chinese symbolism also figures in
the design of the chalkboard doors.‘
According to folklore, Buddha, in 477
B.C., stood upon a stone in Kusinara
with his face to the south. His foot-
prints supposedly remained in the
stone for posterity. On these imprin-
ts are the eight auspicious signs or
treasures of Buddhism, used
repeatedly in Chinese Buddhistic or-
namentation.
emblem for authority, respect, and
dignity. The pair of fish is an emblem
of wealth and abundance. The
mystic knot is the sign of longevity,
because it is endless.

Perhaps the atmosphere of the
room can be best expressed by the
saying above the door: “Humility of
mind goes with loftiness of charac-
ter.”

Swimmers Dunk wvu, 77-36 — Look to Undefeated Season     

By KAREN KADILAK
Pitt News Staff Writer
After defeating West Virginia
77-36 Saturday at Trees Pool, Pitt’s
swim team (8-0) looks forward to its
second straight undefeated season.
Along with Maryland, which lost
to Pitt last weekend, West Virginia
was considered one of the few
teams capable of defeating the «
Panthers.
Pitt has two meets remaining (at
Cleveland State and Cincinnati),
but is favored in each.

“Cincinnati’s going to be tough,
but I think our kids want another
undefeated season, especially our
sophomores,” Pitt coach Fred
Lewis said. “Mickey Termin, Jeff
Trew, Stu Swanson and that gang
haven’t lost yet.”

In the battle of Eastern leaders,
second-ranked Pitt won all but two
events to overwhelm seventh-rank-
ed West Virginia and win its 18th
consecutive dual meet.

‘ ‘We had one or two people off in

ports  

this meet, but that wasn’t bad
considering that 90 percent of our
guys were on,” Lewis said. “We
were on today and it showed
because we swam really well.”

Pitt’s ﬁrst place finishers includ-
ed double winners Trew (S00 and
1,000-yard freestyles); freshman
Rick Carter (50 and 100-yard
freestyles); and Scott Winkler (one
and three-meter diving).

Also winning their events were
Mark Schuman (200-yard indivi-
dual medley); Swanson (200-yard

backstroke); and Bob Clemmer
(200-yard breaststroke).

Both relay teams won also.
Swimming on the 400-yard medley
relay team were Swanson, Clem-
mer, Schuman, and Bob Green-
wald, while Termin, Tom McGin-
ley, Schuman, and Carter compris-
ed the 400-yard freestyle relay
team.

“We knew we had them beat in I

the second event when they put
their two best men in and got

stomped,” Lewis explained.
“They expected to lose the medley
relay (the first event), but not the
1,000-yard freestyle.

“They thought they would win
until Jeff went out there and
whipped their tails,” Lewis said of
Trew’s victory in the 1,000-yard
freestyle.

Pitt travels to Cleveland State
this Saturday before closing out its
dual meet season the following
weekend at Cincinnati.

Panthers Chase
Rainbows, 71-52

By MARIA SCIULLO
Pitt News" Sports Editor

There was a lot one could say
about the University of Hawaii
basketball team. Their warmups
resembled green tie-dyed pajamas
and in eight days they had travelled
over 9000 miles round trip to play
mainland teams. Some of the
Rainbow players’ suntans were an
unnecessary reminder that it
wasn’t 4 degrees all over the
country. There was a lot to say
about the team, which was
fortunate, because for half of Pitt’s
71-52 win over the visiting
Rainbows there wasn’t much to say
about the game.

The Panthers were colder from
the ﬁeld than the weather outside
Fitzgerald Field House during the
first 20 minutes of Monday night’s
contest. Pitt_ managed to ace only
one-third of its shots, although
Hawaii wasn’t shooting well,
either. The result was a sleepy
kind of game where Tim Grgurich’s
Panthers (now 12-8) relied ‘upon
free throws to trot off to the locker
room with a 30-20 halftime lead.

“Hawaii played a matchup zone
against us,” said Grgurich. “Our

kids had never seen it before and
we kept trying zone offenses which
didn’t work.”

Pitt forward Sammie Ellis and
1,734’ spectators woke up in the
second half; Ellis scored all of his
14 points during this period. Terry
Knight also contributed 14 points,
but it was guard Carlton Neverson
who carried the Panthers over the
equally-lethargic Rainbows.

Said Grgurich of the 6-4
sophomore: “Carlton did well
because he was concentrating
better than anyone else tonight.
He had trouble concentrating in our
last game against West Virginia so
we got on him a little at practice
yesterday and he responded.”

“As a team, we were ﬂat
tonight,” said Neverson. “So I
tried to set some kind of example
by going out and moving around,
taking shots.”

Neverson was 5 for 11 from the
ﬁeld and made all six of his free
throws to lead Pitt scorers with 16
points. He also finished with six
rebounds (second only .to Sam

Pitt’s Ne well, Hetz to Try for Olympic Hockey Team

While Pitt’s administration employs every power it

can command in an attempt to send a few students and
faculty members to mainland China, a pair of Pitt
athletes are preparing for what could be a lonely journey
toward Lake Placid, N.Y.

Larry Newell and Curt Hetz have represented Pitt for
four years and, according to some of the persons who
will select the 1980 U.S. Olympic team, Newell and Hetz
have represented Pitt extraordinarily well.

But though each has been invited to compete for a
position with the Olympic team that will battle the rest of
the world at Lake Placid next year, Newell and Hetz are
less well-known about their campus than is Jackie

, Sherril1’s second-string tight end, Benjy Pryor.

The reason for this miscarriage of publicity is that
Newell and Hetz chose four years ago to bring their
considerable hockey skills to Pitt, whose athletic
department refuses to go first-class with any team
that can’t lose to Penn State annually before a
national television audience.

Hetz and Newell, each a fourth-year Panther from
Shaler, are part of a hockey program that has achieved
much—perhaps amazingly much—-since the late Len
Barcalow began to mold the Panthers a few years ago.

4 Pitt’s hockey players perform for the Pitt Hockey
Club, which is not supported by Pitt’s athletic
department. the way a varsity team would be. The
difference goes far beyond the fact that Newell and
Hetz may wear Olympic uniforms but never will

- receive a Pitt letter jacket.

, Hetz and Newell pay for the privilege of representing a
school that desires no part of them; their teammates and
the club’s non-playing members share that burden.

These Panthers pay dues and they pay for travel and
equipment. Because the club is member-supported,

Fine Print

if often cannot afford such things as sufficient ice
time and top-ﬂight equipment.

One result is that despite the effort of Barcalow and
his players, Pitt more than occasionally finds itself
paying painfully for its humble existence when it takes
the ice with Division I schools.

Three such beatings—rare before"Barcalow’s death in

I 1978 but more frequent since this season began—came

against Cincinnati recently. In one loss_, goalie Newell
saw 77 shots come toward him. Nine went past him and
came to rest in Pitt’s net.

But, Newell and Hetz claim, the difference during that
9-4 Cincy win was not talent. “They get more ice time,”
they agreed. “And they knew what they were
doing,..thcy were extremely well-coached. But we had
the talent. We were in that game.”

They were in the game through a pair of periods, but a
four-goal final period gave the Bearcats a win... and
Newell a chance to play for the United States in the
Olympics. ‘

“Cincinnati’s head coach (Pat Rupp) is a member of‘

the screening committee for this regions’s Olympic
hockey trials,” Newell said. “After our four games
against his team (two in Pittsburgh and two in Cin-
cinati) he offered me an application.”

Hetz, working through an acquaintance at National
Hockey League offices, also secured an application from

Rupp and each is preparing for a three-day tryout in
Detroit. Each is seeking a sponsor, since Hetz ant.
Newell will be responsible for their expenses March
22, 23 and 24.

“‘They’re just tryouts,” said Hetz, la hard-shooting
wing at Pitt. “They’ll be cutting from the first day to
the last.” -—

' “I’ve had experience with trials like this,” Newell said.
“Some people will just be outstanding from the
beginning and others will be asked to leave.”

Those who stay will travel to Colorado this summer
for a two-week series of games between regional teams
such as the one to be selected in Detroit.

Pitt may not be serious about hockey, but at least two
of its players are. Newell has resigned a fraternity
presidency in order to pursue his shot at Lake Placid and
he and Hetz currently are searching for ice time.

“Most of the people at these tryouts will have had
a lot of opportunities,” Hetz said. “They’re from
Division I schools...and players from the Inter-
national Hockey League who haven’t taken their
pay.”

“We’ll be doing it for ourselves and for the univer-
sity as a whole, even though the athletic department
won’t do anything for us.”

Newell and Hetz each could have attended a
“hockey school.” Hetz spurned a University of
Denver scholarship before enrolling here.

“But I don’t regret what I'did,” said Hetz, even
though he could be excused if he regretted what Pitt
hasn’t done for a hockey team that asks only a
chance.

 Win, 69-67

’ By ANNA ARLOTTA

“We’ve been in close situations
this year and have had negative
results but against WVU we really
held together and pulled it eff,”
said Coach Jean Balthaser after her
Pantherettes scored a much-de-
served 69-67 win over ‘the
Mountaineers of West Virginia
University. ‘

“We held together in a very
crucial situation, which is a big plus
for us,” added Balthaser.

The Pantherettes were ahead by
two’ points with less than one
minute remaining, in the game
when the teams were involved in a
jump ball situation" under -._the Pitt

basket. The4Pantherettes control- .

led the tap and ‘ran out the

' 30-second clock. A Pitt shot was

taken and missed, leaving 10
seconds remaining with the Moun-
taineers possessing the ball. WVU
shot but missed letting Kit Loeffler
grab the rebound for the Panther-
ettes. Time ran out and Pitt was
victorious.

Pitt was never ahead in the
contest until six minutes remained
in the game.

“We outplayed them,” said
Balthaser. “We had 11 more field
goals than they did, which is 22
more points from‘ the ﬂoor but we
still only won by 2 points. We were
outrebounded because all of our
big people were in trouble early, so
we had to play a more conservative
game.” -

Fouls were prevalent in’ the
game, with the Pantherettes
racking up an amazing 31. The

Mountaineers converted on 37

shots from the foul line, a ﬁgure '

that carried a lot of weight in the
ﬁnal point totals.

“WVU is a very intimidating
place to play,” said Balthaser,
“but we had a tremendous amount
of composure. We played a group
together at the end of the game
that had never played together as a
unit before. V

Pantherette height was lost in
the last quater when Stephanie
Stripling, Wanda Randolph (with
14. points) and Gail Aughburns
fouled out.

Panthers Place at Pn'ne   ton
Freshman triple jumper Larry Kinney broke his own Pitt record

Sunday afternoon at the Princeton Relays with a jump of 50-6‘/2. Two

weeks ago at the Pitt Invitational, Kinney leaped 50-4 to set the record.

At Princeton, he fouled a 51-foot jump but came back to place third
with his 50-6‘/2 effort. Is it possible that setting new records is getting

monotonous? ,
“I sure hope not,” said Kinney.

Panther Tim Blackshear also placed inthe triple jump. He wasfifth

with a jump of 48-5‘/2.

Pitt’s only other top-six ﬁnisher was the two-mile relay. Greg
Conover, Darren Geary, Gary Siriano and Bill McShea cut eight
seconds off their time from the CYO meet in January. Their 7:40.3
clocking was fast enough to place them fourth out of the ten team’s
entered in the Championship Division. Forty teams in all were entered,

30 in the College Division.

The splits for the two-mile relay were Conover (1:56), Geary (1:52.5),
Siriano (l:54.4) and McShea (l:56.8).

This weekend, Pitt travels to Ohio State for a triangular meet with
OSU and Wisconsin. Several Panthers hope to qualify for the NCAA
championships against these two tough teams.

(Continued from page 9) ‘-
Clancy’s 12) and added a blocked
shot. , I

Clancy, who has been averaging
over 16 points per game, scored

‘ only eight against Hawaii mainly

because he chose to pass off often
instead of move toward’ the basket
in an attempt to shoot.

“Sam did an awful lot of passing
tonight,” said Grgurich. “We put
him at the high post, which is still a
different and new position for
him.” As a result, the Panther

center ended up with. five assists.’

As usual, top assist man of the

evening was guard Pete Strickland.

His seven assists bring the new Pitt
record for career assists to 340.
Strickland broke Keith Starr's team
record against Duquesne last week.

‘ ‘The game was kind of slow for a
while,” said Strickland. “After
playing three games in one week,
we were bound to be a little tired.
We were kind of disappointed with
the crowd though. I mean, we’ve
been doing real well lately and
you’d think the fans would come
out and support us.”

_ “I know it’s a weeknight, but
hey, I have a test tomorrow too and
I was here.” ‘ N i
“We needed intensity tonight,”
Grgurich explained, “but we just
didn’t have it. We knew this would
happen, though. You come off a
big win or two and then it’s hard to
get emotional about your next
game.” '9

Hawaii, now 5-14, wasn’.t getting
toogemotional about the loss. By
the time this story is printed, they
will be back in Honolulu where, as
‘one reserve player admitted, “We
still don’t win a lot, but it’s a lot
more fun.”

PITT NOTES: The game was
televised back to the islands and
probably had the folks back home
snickering. over the way Pitts-
burghers had to dress...Tom
Loudenand Jo“e7Frazier led the
Rainbows with 117 and 13 pointif
respectively...Clancy saved his
best shot of the night for last,

dunk with one second remaining...
Pitt plays St. Francis tonight at the
Field House, in an 8 p.m.
contest...Despite some sloppiness
at the beginning of the game, the
Panthers only committed 13 turn-
overs...The team had ﬁve blocked
shots...Surprisingly, Hawaii outre-
bounded Pitt, 36-33...St. Francis,
led by '6-7 forward Nick Leasure,
has lost five out of their last six

— games...The Frankies have never

beaten Pitt in basketball, althoughi

from-behind two-point win last
season...Duquesne guard B.B.
Flenogy says he may not play in
tonight’s game against West
Virginia. There has beenno love
lost between Flenory and the
Mountaineers ever since B.B. was
seriously injured in a game two
years ago by a WVU player...

I Who Will Quarterback the Panthers Next September?

Now that Central Catholic quarterback Dan
Marino is set to sign with Pitt, words are being ban-
tered about as to whether or not the 6-4, 198 pound
freshman-to-be is capable of stepping on campus this
fall and winning the number one position from the

I incumbent, Rick Trocano. Rather than making a

public proclamation as to one’s superiority, a simple

analysis of each player’s strengths and weaknesses
would be fairer to both parties.

A one and one-half year starter, Trocano is 11-4 as
Pitt’s starting quarterback, and is possibly the most
experienced sophomore quarterback on the major
college level. He is familiar with Pitt’s offense. But
remember, the new coaches desire to junk the veer,
Pitt’s run-oriented offense during the 1978 season
that was best suited to Trocano’s running ability.

Next year’s team promises to present Pitt fans with
a more wide open attack featuring a strong-armed
passer. But it is here that Trocano’s ability is
somewhat suspect.

By SAMUEL SCIULLO

 

’ Dan Marino is rated one of the top high school
quarterbacks in the nation by many college scouts
and quarterbacks. Possessor of an outstanding
passing arm, Marino is also a better—than-average
runner. The adjustment from high school to college
football, especially for a quarterback, is never easy
and this could keep Marino under wraps at the
beginning of next season. Added pressure could
come from Pittsburgh area fans, who know
Marino’s name and would like to see the local boy
step in and become the instant hero. An added
dimension is Marino’s punting ability, as evidenced
by his 40.2 average this past season.

Where does this leave Lindsay Delaney, Scott Jen-

ner and Danny Daniels, you say? Probably fighting
for the top backup position. _

And do you want to know who Pitt’s starting quar-
terback will be Sept. l5 when the Panthers play Kan-
sas at Pitt Stadium?

One thing’s for sure. Itiwill probably be someone
with an Italian sounding, three-syllable name which
ends in “no.” Take your pick.

Word on the street reports that the Field House
seating capacity will be expanded to 7,300 for the
next basketball season. Pitt officials have been
talking about such changes for several years, but
nothing has materialized. ,

Last spring, elaborate plans for expansion were
announced amidst great hoopla. And what is there
to show for it? Only hope that the new locker rooms I
for .Pitt’s women’s teams will be completed in the
near future.

And Tim Grgurich is left wondering where his
team fits into the list of athletic priorities at Pitt.
