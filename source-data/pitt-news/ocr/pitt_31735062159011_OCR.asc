To Armament Splurge

{ Of Roosevelt Regime

By ROBERT SAFFRON

The time has come to call
halt to the stagggci-iiig military
appropriations of the Roosevelt
adininistration.

Always a. “big navy’ advo-
cate, the president has asked
Coi1g1'ess for an appropriation
of $991,300,000 to provide for
“national defense” for the coming
year. This represents in increase
of $34,300,000 over the previous
year.

Relief has been cut. $841,356,000.

CCC funds have been cut $124,-

But“ the administration asks for
more money to defend America.

Armament Race

In short, we have deﬁnitely en-
tered into an armament race with
the European count.ries. The navy
department has disclosed its intent
to build an Atlantic ﬂeet as large
as the present main ﬂeet, which is
concentrated in the Paciﬁc.

Mr. Roosevelt clearly stated in
his budget message that even more
will be requested later:

“Due to world conditions over
which this nation has no control,
I may haveto ask for additional
appropriations for national de-
tense.”

National defense‘?

When the bulk of the additional
money asked by the navy depart-
ment is to be spent on aircraft car-
riers and airplanes‘?

Wlien $811,725-—not. much but
enough to indicate the trend—has
been earmarked for strengthening
of our fortiﬁcations on Hawaii and
Panama?

Colossal Total

Our “national defense” program,
not including the more than half
billion needed for veterans’ pen-
sions and the uncalculable sum ex-
pended on paying the interest on
past wars, will reach the colossal
total next year of $1,200,000,000.

Business Dean Stresses Need

Of M on With Cultural Tra,in,ingi

Business men of the c.on1i.ng¢

gcneratioii must be able to
adapt themselves, more than
ever before, to clianging‘ social
and economic conditions, ac-
cording to Dr. Charles S. Tip-
petts, dean of the School of
Business Administration.

“\Vhat American business
wants is more men who can lift
their eyes beyond the limited hor-
izon of daily routine. We have
enough men who can perform a
task in a technical or mechanical
manner. But the.pre—eminent need
‘of American business life today is
for men who will understand the
social and economic implications
of wh jﬁstiiey are doing,” says Dr.
Tippet‘t..‘.'i" 

University students of business

administration must accept the re-
sponsibility of learning how to
control economic and business
problems of today, he claims. One
method of helping business stu-
dents to gain a broader viewpoint
on problems which may later con-
front them is, in Dr. Tippetts’
opinion, additional study of cul-
tural subjects.

“Our experiences during the last
eight years have shown that
knowledge gained only from con-
tact with practical affairs does not
teach men how to settle great so-
cial and economic questions,” he
explains.

“University professors of busi-
ness subjects must, in a sense, be
crusaders for a high standard of
business coridu‘ct,” adds Dr. Tip-
petts.

Comparisons for similar periods
last year show a large drop. In-

Dr. Gilbreth Outlines
Qualities For Success

annual ‘Nomen’s Day assembly
professor of management at Pur-
due university, emphasized “com-
petence and tolerance” as the ne-
cessary qualities for success in
business.

Citing examples of women who
{have attained success to a certain
f degree in a world of business for-
'merly occupied exclusively by
men, Dr. Gilbreth explained that
, the entrance of women into busi-
ness has been caused for the most

part by the introduction of “me-
chanical housewives” into the

home.

WOMEN IN BUSINESS

In the centuries before the age
of machinery, a housewife spent
her time doing by hand all the
chores which today are carried out
efficiently and more quickly by
3 electrical apparatus.

Consequently, with their house-
hold duties so well taken care of,
women are ﬁnding that they have
a great amount of time and energy

in stores, on staffs of industrial or-
ganizations, in scientific labora-
tories, in business offices as stenc-
graphers, even in positions of great
responsibility with the govern-
ment.
TWELFTH ASSEMBLY

“It is surprising to note,” con-
cluded Dr. Gilbretb, “that men,
although. ﬁnding their positions
‘usurped,’ are as a rule quite toler-
ant with women in business; for
in many cases certain jobs are bet-
ter ﬁtted for women than for
men.”

Last Friday’s assembly, held in
Foster Memorial, was the twelfth
of its kind to be held at the Uni-
versity commemorating the ad-
mission of women here 42 years
ago. ,

Highlight of the meeting was

In recent months, the Alliance
has attracted wide attention by
attempting to uphold the cause of
labor organizations in several in-
dustrial strikes. Last month, the
Alliance picketed the national

Peace and Democracy,” claiming
that the organization was Com-
munistic.

pages in which are" 14 chapters of;
material on the subject of -unem-If

the book are charts explaining;

The primary aim of this study,
according to Dr. Watson, is to‘?
analyze the economic reasons un-f

the reasons why this problem
will not disappear with the re—:
turn of “prosperity."

Most of the statistical material
deals» with Allegheny county. A
majority of the material deals
directly with the Pittsburgh dis-
trict, using it as representative
of national conditions.

Monthly estimates of the num-
ber unemployed for the period
from 1929 to 1936, also are given.
In addition, there are estimates
of the time in human labor lost
during this period of unemploy-
ment, and a chapter outlining

Civil War opens Wednesday!

General H. Clifford Carlson and
General Charles Robinson Davies
will march their basketball forces
to the Stadium Wednesday night,
to oiﬁcially open the City Confer-
ence battle. Neither the Duquesne
or Pitt outfits are up to their
fo‘m of. last season, but you can
bet your ticket money for the
Pitt-Fordham’ grid game next
fall, that they’ll be at top form
for thisimid-week clash.

The Bluffmen. without a regu-

very lll'fOi'tul1e_ of stacking up
against ’the'nation’s two best goal-
makers, Hank Luisseti, of Stan-
ford, and l\lir.-l»: Frascella, of Woos-

‘DUKES EVEN

Frascella held the record last‘

through the cords for 35 points in
one game. This campaign his

countryman, Luisetti, topped that,
evening's shooting. by hitting true 5

for the ovewrlielming point total
of 50, against “the Dukes.
Needless to add,
and Wooster. The Daviesmen al-
so round‘ up, on the short end
against Waynesburg, and did the

TARTANS STRONGEST

Carnegie Tech. the third mem-,2

ber of the_,_City Conference, is,
.i'rc~m all accounts, the strongest of
the threesome. Coach Maxie
I-lannum is supplied with an unu-

sually large squad of first-grade;

courtmen. "His two senior stars,
Captain Billy ivliller and “Buzzy”
Greenberg, have staged a scoring
duel in nearly every contest, which
doesn’t bother Der Maxie at all.
In sophomore Rube Stark, Gor-
don Combs, and “Slim” Tumpane,
the Tartan’s have something to
sing about. This triumvirate of
ﬁrst—yeav: men‘ have plenty ofithe
ol’ moxie. They’re slippery,
tough. smart, good shots, steady
dribblers and dependable passers.
And what's inore important,
they, together =.vith lVIiller
Greenberg, liave been winning
games. Only one defeat in six
starts is marked down against the
Skibos. The City League race,
will be hotter, if such a thing is

something!

That’s just what John lVIcSor—

McSorley makes no predictions‘
but it’s not hard to gather that he
expects his pucksters to go out.

at least show up well in defeat as
they did against Duquesne, andi

Those tears that Olson shed
over the graduation of some of
his trackmen seem to be a little
on the crocodilevside. This year’s
crop of sophomores is going to be
responsible for a good many
points.

The sophs are going to ﬁll the

furore that makes every one,

,sophs, juniors, and seniors, turn

on the pressure to keep his spot

enjoying the furore.

Right now his mile relay team
is chasing around the track, train-
ing for the Millrose games. There
are seven running for those three
open posts on the quartet. John-
ny Woodrufl‘ is the only sure start-
er. Four. of the seven, Frank
Ohl, Allen McKee. Al Ferrara,
and Robert Cogswill, are sopho-

The same situation holds true
for the rest of the squad. All

mores harrying the juniors and
seniors, making them step on the
gas. lt’s not quite fairbecause
after all last year’s men hadn’t
counted on such troubles. That’s
why the veteran trackmen look a
little worried. That’s why Coach
Carl Olson doesn’t look worried.

Beautiful Trophy
Stands Three
Feet In Height

Robert A. Corley, assistant to

. the dean of men and major demo
of interi'1'atei‘nity competition, has

perched high atop a cabinet in his
office a trophy destined to blow the
already hot competition among the
fraternities into a white hot ﬂame.

The trophy pictured here  the
coveted cup Corley so closely
guards. It will be given to the
fraternity scoring the most points
in :1 new system of cumulative
point scoring.

GREATER INVENTIVE

The awarding of this cup at the
end of the year will mark a mile-
stone in interfrat competition. at

Pitt. Never before has there been
a cup given symbolizing the cham-

of competition. and it is expected
that this cup will add to the ﬂavor
and spice of fraternity games by
giving a greater incentive, espe-
cially this tirst year.

From theshield-'-covered base to
the tip of the traditional victory
wreath of old Greek games the
golden cup measures almost three
feet. ’

ALL ’SPOR'FS

Around the base of the gleaming
trophy are four ﬁgures vividly de-
picting action in four of the major
sports of Greek warfare. Basket-
ball, football, track, and bowling
have been awarded these four
poses. _

On the lower part of the base
ten shields have been placed upon
which to engrave the winners’
names. It is not a permanent
possession cup, but rather a rotat-

Students Want Dr. Hovde
Back On Campus

VER the l71'1iversity’s Cln'°ist1n.as holiday,
the city budget-makers do\vnto\vn were
worrying over wliat. to do about. balancing a
budget in wliich estimated receipts were thou-
sands of dollars less than estimat.e(l expendi-
lures.

But. slaslws in department. liead estimates by
both the IV-layor and (jouucil, and a bit of fi-
nancial jiggliiig, enabled the admi.nistrat.ion
to present to l.’ittsburgl1 citizens a balanced
budget. , _

Every depart.n1ent head. in the Sci1lly»cab-
inet urgecl more appropriations for itself.
Each department needed additional help, addi-
tional equipment, salary raises, and replace-
mcnts.

But, in pra.ctic-ally every case, all recom-
mended extra appropriations were cut out,-
and each department. was told to run on the
same ﬁgures as this year.

There. was but one iinportant salary raise-
recommended not only by the department
head, but by the inayor, civic Welfare b0(li(*S
and the like-which was granted by Council.

That raise, from five to eight thousand per
annum, went. through vdthouta whisper of
protest from anyone. Council who had been
slashing and cutting unmercifully unanimous-
ly approved the raise. _ V

It went to the head of the City’s Depart-
ment of Public \V'elfare, Dr. B. J. Hovdc.

"Dr. Hovdc has been associated here at the
University for quite some time now, and While 
here made a reputation for himself that. was .
«the equaland, according to most students, su-
lperior-of.n1ost men on the faculty. His presence
in the department of history did much to ele-
vate that depzn-t,mcnt"to a. high positionin ‘na-
tional scholastic. circles.

His teaching a'.nd..-his relations with students,
other__,men“6n the faculty, and the a.dministra-

ling.-._th man. was, and is, a greatlexperience

And now the undergraduates, appreciating
more «than ever that Dr. Ilovde is respected
outside scholastic circles as much as inside,
want him back teaching; regularly his History
61 (62), or some other undergraduate course.

True enough, Dr. Hovde has one Saturday
class. But for the average undergraduate who
does not have class on Saturday this one class
cannot take care of the need;-a genuine need
for more men of Dr. Hovde’s calibre in the
University and the retention of such men that

 A Landmark

'.HE schedule of curricula for next year will

not include the Survey Course.

According to faculty members, this will be
nothing more than recognition of a. situation
that already exists. The Survey Course, they
declare, has existed only in name, has, after a
“trial period” of several years, been found

unnecessary. 

Before passing judgment, let us review
briefly the nature of the Survey block as it
has existed for the last few years. Subjects
included are, nominally, Survey of Fine Arts,
Survey of Social Science, Survey of Science,
and Survey of English.

Of the four courses, the Survey of Science
is the only course that carried survey ma-
The Survey of Eng-
lish was freshman composition, different only
from the regular composition. classes in its in-
structor, the head of the department.

The Fine Arts course was identical to and
combined with the regular class in the intro-
duction t.o Fine Arts. A similar situation e.x- ,
isted in the Social Science course, which dif— l
fered from the regularily scheduled History
of Western Civilization in the fact that the
conference section was lead by the class lec-
turer instead of his assistants.

As such, it is apparent that the only ad-
vantage obtained by the freshman student tak-
ing the Survey block--which really was not
2. Survey block at all-Was, that while receiv-
ing instruction given all freshman, he received
it fromthe leaders in each of the departments.

And now the committee on curriculum has

’ the readings.

decided to recognize-a truth: it is removing a

u<.n1ienclatu.rc from a. course. that never ‘ex-
isted. ' 

\\'e do not p1~ote.st to be eoilucators. ‘We are
_lllOS6 who, on the other side of the i".e.nce, are
aiming to be educate(l. And some of us. we
would say, llave. taken. the Survev course in
years past, so we speak not \»vit.h autliority
but with inf.'o1.'mation.

\‘\'e would siiggest that the very best means
of testing a 1):-os,:ra.1n is, first, to provide ‘the,
program. The only means by which we can de- l
Vclop a. taste for olives is by eating olives.
Eating prunes will be of no value.

As we have said, we are not educators.Bu.t
if we were to be asked what we should do with
the now defiiuct Stzrvey C‘our,se, we ‘\’\"'()1ll.(l.
make these recommendati.ons: '

First, W'(‘.'\\'0‘1ll(l s:mcti_on§ the move of the
committee: we would be v.'ill.in_s; to recognize
‘the fact. A

Second, we would begin. to draw plans for a
reorganized Survey (f',ourse, insistiiig‘--vvit.li.
the ol.ive,-prune ﬁgure in mind-~tl1at substi-
tutes are nothing more than substitutes. \Vc
would consider each course as a unit. Tliese
would be our recommendations. .

Survey of Fine Arts: The course will be
planned. to include, besides Inaterial given in
tlic regular basic music and art appreciation
courses, a seasoning of lectures by aut.l1ori.iiies'
on. con.t.e1nporar_v l.l2l1l(l.l.Cl'§.lft arts. The course
will be a survey.

Survey of Social Sciences: The pr-esexit
course in Hist'or_v of \Vestern Civilization. will
be supplanted by a well-orga.niz<'+(l course cov-
ering the fundameutals- of all, iiistead ‘of.-ou_.e,
of the social sciences. Professors inthe ﬁelds
of Political Science, Economics, History,
Sociology, and (lovernment. Service will pre-
sent thoroughly planned lectures on the funda-
mentals of their part'icu_lar. subject. The course
will be a. survey. . L-

Survey of Science: This course alone has
had the car marks of a survey. I-hit the oolirsc
will be more thorouglily organized and the na-
turc of the material better distributed. Lec-
turers to speak before the class will prepare
their lectures well in advance of the time of
preseiitatioii, and the class will be under the
general supervision of one faculty member.
Assignments will include readings in the vari-
ous ﬁelds, with reports "submitted covering

the department. in charge of the class.

The value of the course  represented here,
and as the original plan provided, is self-
evidcnt. Discussion on this point is unneces-
sary: enrollment of students for the course
will be the test of its merits.

Vllhilc We are not educators, we would mg-
gest that the com1nit.t.ce in charge of cur-
riculum begin, next year, a Survey Course. We
would suggest that a Survey Course—~which
is a Survey Course--be given a trial period.

By ¢7I4ary Lewis
This seems to be the season for heart affairs and
what makes it tough is that it's the season for
exams too. A good antidote for lovitis when your
only affliction should be studyitis is the adoption
of a cynical attitude. However, my children, be
careful that this antidote doesn’t stick with you, for
I’d certainly hate to be the cause of a school of
Cynics, us having such a romantic campus too . . .
in spring. Among those afflicted, whose lovitis has
passed the preliminary stages (in other words it’s
old stuff but helps ﬁll the column) are Peggy Mc-
Gee and Roy Walters, the ever faithful “Soupy”
Campbell and Mary Annette Campbell, Ruth Cus-
ter and Sam Werlinich, and Betty Batty and Bob
Schooley (this is really hot off the press since
they have only been going together since high
school). Those in the serious stages: Mary Jane
Firth who pines for a mid-shipman and Pat Frank-

lin who likes a Princeton lad.

Poor, poor Larry Orr doesn’t know what to do with
himself since Joan Young got herself a. nervous
breakdown and a. trip to bed every nite at 10
o’clock. Bob Culbertson really started the New
Year right with a. party that lasted for two days
. . . he's going to have another one between semes-
ters so be nice to him and you might get invited.

NOTES FROM MY LITTLE PINK BOOK:

Betty Scott and her New York -man have called
the whole thing off . . Ray Light can start to
shave again since Mary Richmond agreed to go to
the Junior Prom with him . . . Bob Forsythe took
care of Jane Pickard over the holidays for Bernie
Summers. Jane Mehler’s boy friend presented her
with a shiny new alarm clock for Xmas, the idea
being that he stays to hear it go off. The'Phi Gams
should be careful about calling Homer Mcclintock
“Frenchy” . . It’s what is known as bad pub-
licity. Kay Simons says Curly Stebbins and a
brother Phi Del’: played poker in the baggage car
between Williamsport and Altoona and really had
agood time. ~ ~ «» ~

“This high-building university
will be all right if the student can
ﬁnd ways to jazz the logic of it
. the problem is, will there be
room for FOOLISHNESS in a
building of this sort?

“The trees at old I. U. vcbere I
xwent were not exactlyy foolish,
but they were soft, and achieved
the same result as an educational
factor. You came out of a class-
room where cold science had ruled
your young brain for ﬁfty minutes
and the trees told you that science
will never get Anywhere That
Matters. - -

SOMETHING MISSING

“Of course, science will fix your
teeth and cure your cold and bring
down the price of motor cars, but
these things are nothing unless
they help you to ﬁnd and enjoy
the beauty andisoftuess and silli-
ness of life." The only justifica-
tion for all of Mr. Ford’s eﬁiciency
‘is the annual increase in the num-
ber of family picnics the
only use for Efﬁc-iency is to enable
us to be Inefficient.

Members Of Madden
Family Make History

By ~IR‘ENE LONG’

To enjoy a Hardy laugh,
must not stray far from the Mad-
deningfcrowd. Naturally, we are
talking about the delightful l\’lad-
den family, which has been an in-
stitution around here for many a
goon.

Firstly, there is Dr. J. Warren
Madden, professor of. law, who is
on leave of absence from the Uni.-
versity to administer his numerous
duties as Chairman of the National

Labor Relations Board in Washing-
ton. He wasfa
few years ago,
dean ofthe law
school here and
at West Virginia
University, and
formerly taught
at Stanford.
Dr. Madden,
a brilliant law-
yer, gained na-
tional recogni-
tion last spring
b y defending
th e vigorously
disputed Wag-
ner Labor Relations Act before the
Supreme Court of the United
States.
as an attorney is necessary than
the fact that the legislation was
declared constitutional by the
Venerable Nine.

DAUGHTER FOLLOVVS

. As a person, Mr. Madden (who
hates to be called Dr.) is most
genial and kindly, and possesses
an excellent sense of humor. He
loves to dig around in his garden
and propels the entire family into
planting petunias, hoeing, weed-
ing, and gathering brush around
the family home on Andover Ter-
race. Too, he enjoys leading the
family orchestra or having a sing
around the piano.

Following in her father’s legal
trail is daughter Mary, who grad-
uated from the University school
of law in June and was admitted
to the bar as a full-‘ﬂedged lawyer
this fall.‘ This young lady, who
used to collect dues from the
Thetas in her undergraduate days,
is now on the legal staff of the
state labor board in Harrisburg.
She has a penchant for long walks
and drags along anybody with the
stamina. Last winter she taught
swimming and tennis at the down-
town YWCA, and that curly thatch
of hair could be usually seen win9;-
ing its way down VVylie Avenue to
Chatham Street on many a mom
or night. '

BROTHER JOE

Next is brother Joe, who is at
present capering ‘around the four-
teenth floor as a’ ﬁrst year student
in law school. Folks around here
will remember him as being a
member of ODK, president of Pitt
Players, captain of thevarsity ten-
nis team, a member of the Owl
Hall of Fame, Cap and Gown star,

No further itribute "to him‘

here when an undergraduate. He
clima:-zed his activities by Winning
the annual. poetry reading contest
when a senior. But most of all, he
contributed of his immense wit on
all occasions.

BOB'S CHAlVII’

The third Mud.den is Robert.
Bob is best known as being seeded
No. 1 tennis player in Western
‘Pennsylvania. His many tennis
titles are imposing; No. 1. man in
the entire Middle States section of
the USLTA being but one of them.
One summer when the Australian
Davis Cup team stopped in Pitts-
burgh for an exhibition match at
the Pittsburgh Golf Club, Bob,

in the country, unloosed a barrage
of drives, volleys, and serves on
his famous opponent, Vivian Mc-
Grath, that had the Anzac running
around in circles.

Bob has also played in the na-
tional cbampionships at Forest
Hills, and greatly enjoyed being
trounced by that top-notcher of
all tennis players, Bill Tilden. He
barely missed, on one occasion, up-
fsetting Bobby Riggs, the nation’s
lfourth ranking player, in a whoop-
ing three set match. The experi-
ence, he said,‘-wasrifswclllif

“IB” LEAVES PITT

Not only is the lad a champ ten-
nis player, but a prospective lead-
ing man of Hollywood as well.
Last winter, a talent scout, nosing
around campus, seized upon him
when he was acting in Pitt Players’
shows. This summer he worked
with the Paramount studios in
New York, and apparently his
prospects are excellent. He re-
cently participated in “Excursion,”
a Pittsburgh Playhouse production.

Elizabeth, who is better known
around here as “Ib,” was a :t".resh-'
man in the University last year
and has upset family tradition by
declining to be a lawyer. She
likes to cook and builds ‘luscious
chocolate devil food cakes. This
year she is attending George
Washington University in Wash-
ington, but likes Pitt better. She,
too, swings a wicked tennis rac-
quet.

MOTHER IS GRAND

Finally, there is Murdaugh Mad.-
den, otherwise Tuz, who is also
contemplating‘ a legal career. He
[will begin college next year. In
lhis earlier days Tuz used to be a
‘demon and would sic Stooge, the
family’s dog, upon visitors to their
home. But he is becoming more
docile now, and waits until Bob
and Joe leave the house before he
purloins their ties and shirts.

But the person about whom the
family is centered is their most
charming mother. Mrs. Madden,’
with her delightful sense of humor,
has kept young with her family,
and has raised them in a most sen-
sible way. She thinks her family
is grand.

And so does everyone else!

Stanley Z

But. enough of me. let's go back
to “Stand In" and Leslie Howard
and how Leslie felt about “Stand
ln.” Of course I don’t claim to
actually know how Leslie Hovvaird
feels about “Stand In.” I am just
“hazarding a guess,” to coin a
phrase, on how he felt about the
whole business.

And from little bits of informa-
tion gleaned hither and you it
seems to me that Leslie must have
experienced the same sinking feel-
ing at the previews of “St.and‘ ln”
he felt when he read the reviews
of Gielgud’s Hamlet. "

Frankly Pd rather not say any-
thing more about the picture. It
came as a disappointment and I
think it would be better for me
and you and the Stanley if I kept
my mouth shut, an opinion vmicli
I share vvitli. a few law students to
mention a few.
