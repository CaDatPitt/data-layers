By John Kulamer

How keenly does the faculty here feel-

the pinch" of inﬂation?

What effects have the ‘economies

' made necessary to meet rising costs had’

on the individual’s efficiency, or his de-
sire to continue in the profession?

- In an effort to answer these ques-
tions, the local chapter of" the American
Association of University Professors re-
cently conducted a "questionnaire poll of

a sampleof the teaching population here. '

‘S The study was made" by“a%_committee
headed by »Dr. Ernest Greenwood, of
the School of Social Work.

Results were arrived at by tabula-
tion and analysis of about 300‘question-
naire forms that were returned.

The respondents, according to the
committee report, include teachers ‘

A statistical analysis of the signiﬁ-
cance of the sample as representative of

the whole faculty was not made, but Dr;

Greenwood said his committee was sat-
isﬁed that, it presentstra good picture of
the. entire group. ,
“There is nothing to indicate that we
do not have a signiﬁcant. sample,” he
said. 
Here _are ' the ‘highlights of _the‘_
committee-reportzb __ 3
Median incomes have ‘risen about
25 percent ii-om 1946 to_ 1952. yFThe\
tabulation‘ _s‘hewed-‘the median toi-

 the schoolyear 1945-46 to be $4,500;

for the yeai_'g'1951-:52 to be $5,500.

(The U. ‘s. Statistieal Abstracts»

27 percent from 1946 to 1950, ,the~

_   Falcutiy thee me vs. thelntlatiene

with the rise in faculty incomes it *

would be remembered that prices

continued their _climb‘from 1950 to

1952.) _ _

In 1952 halflof the respondents were
in the .four—to-six-thousand-dollar in-

come bracket, while about one seventh

were. earning less than four thousand.

One fourth said their ~wives were
working part time to support the family
income.-‘ T ’ 4

In the matter of expenditures the
profs complained most about the rise» of
food prices. Other items which they said
have gotten more expensive are trans-r
portation, housing, clothing, insurance,
and medical care. ‘

-To -compensate for these increas-
ed costs the respondents said they
have had to cut their outlay for re-
creations and vacations, and profes-

Some also said they‘ experienced» in-
_ _ __\ .‘
security, nervous tensions, and mental

‘strain from -the cost pinch that, had‘ its__

effect upon their work‘. . _
In spite of these difficulties, the

majority of faculty members are sat- ‘  "

isﬁed with their professional choice,
'according _.to ﬁgures in the report.
Three-ﬁfths of the respondents said:
the satirsfaction of their work justify
their remaining in the ﬁeld. ,
A fourth say ‘they are sorry they
took up teaching, but only a seventh re--~

Ecker said “council should get this
thing over with before the old
members are out of ofﬁce.”

Ecker said that Dean of Men T.
W.‘Biddle is in agreement with the
plan.

Ecker then called for Lou Gua-
rascio’s mixer dance report;

Guarascio said that WSGA is to
blame for the lack of mixer dances.

In his, report, Guarascio said that .

he could ﬁnd no place to hold a
mixer dance. «When asked about
help from the women, he told
council that he could get no ﬁnan-
cia? aid or co-‘operation from
WSGA. , ,

‘Council said it would make fur-
ther attempts to get mixers back
on the Pitt social scene.

-Every year some talk of cheat-

In the last issue of the Panther,
there was an article on cheating
as seen here at Pitt. A good ar-
ticle, but one which emphasized
- a point which I ﬁnd -questionable.
The basic conclusion reached
_ was, that the student‘is to blame
.. for cheating.
\ The article then-implied that
it’s the teacher who should
change his ways. , '

ing cheating. However,» I’d'like
to stop one moment and pity the

’ Poor weather has forced Coach Ralph Mitter1ing’s spring

they were-able to shag ﬂies and run about freely, the Pan-
