The suspense was over two minutes
into Monday's press conference at Pitt
Stadium. After Athletics Director Steve
Pederson welcomed the press, alumni,
faculty and students in attendance, a
video projector to Pederson's right came
to life.

Before it could show a highlight reel
of the 1997 Pitt season or blare the open-
ing notes of "Walking in Memphis," the
projector projected a simple blue logo.

It was a bell. The Liberty Bell, to be

exact.

With that one image, the crowd
knew what a few days of Backyard
‘Brawl-induced bowl hysteria had
wrought: a berth in the 1997 AXA
Equitable Liberty Bowl, scheduled for
Dec. 31 in Memphis, Tenn. V

"It’s a great honor for me to receive
this invitation to participate in the 1997
Liberty Bowl,” said Pederson. “It is a
great tribute to Coach Walt Harris, his
staff and our outstanding team for what
they have accomplished this season.”

The man who took Martin Luther
King Jr. to Memphis, Tenn., where he was
assassinated in 1968, has established a
fund to pay for a liver transplant in
Pittsburgh for King's confessed killer,
James Earl Ray.

The Rev. James Lawson started the
Martin Luther King Truth and Justice
Fund, which accepts public donations
through his church in Los Angeles,
according to Jerry Little, the spokesman
for Ray's attorney.

In Tennessee, where 69-year-old Ray
is serving a 99-year sentence, two organ
transplant programs rejected Ray based on
his age.

But University of Pittsburgh Medical
Center doesn't discriminate against age.
Doctors there have perfonned more than
250 transplants in patients over the age of
65.

"After evaluating the results of about
30 tests, we concluded that [Ray] was a
good candidate for a transplant," said Lisa
Rossi, spokeswoman for UPMC. She said
he'll immediately be put on the list once he

Construction is being done on Hillman Library after concrete fell in it Sunday night.

Things that go bump in the night

Concrete slabs fall in on first floor of Hillman

Brett Taylor

News Assistant

It sounded like aloud clap of thun-
der, said one bystander at Hillman
Library, after a concrete block broke
loose and crashed through a thick pane‘
of glass above the left entrance to the
building late Sunday night.

The 4- by 4—foot block swung like
a hinge from the top of the doorway,
crashed through the window and then
hung in front of the door.

It apparently broke loose after an
old brace gave way, according to build-
ing supervisor Greg McCormick.

Nobody was injured, but the
library was forced to close early.

Both ground-ﬂoor entrances were
roped off all day Monday, forcing
library users to trek up the front stairs

to the first-ﬂoor entrance, which was
opened up for the day.

McCormick said the right entrance
was closed down for precautionary rea-
sons. The Office of Facilities
Management will be removing the four
blocks above each door and replacing
them.

He added that the precaution was
also taken because asbestos may have
been exposed through the hole that
opened when the block broke away,
and it may take some time to clear it
out.

McCormick said the ground-ﬂoor
entrances should be reopened on
Tuesday.

"It's getting to be an old building,"
McCormick said. "Plus [the blocks]
may not have been put up well in the
ﬁrst place."

While the proceedings went on

Give James Earl Ray
a liver transplant  

James Earl Ray confessed 28 years ago to the
murder of Martin Luther ‘King Jr. VV1thin a short
time, he withdrew his confession, claiming he was
coerced into giving it, but by that time he had already
been sentenced — without a trial —— to 99 years in
prison.

Today, Ray is dying of cirrhosis of the liver. Two
hospitals in Tennessee — the state in which he is
imprisoned — have rejected him from their liver
transplant programs because he is four years older
than their cut off age of 65. UPMC, however, has
approved him as a potential candidate and will place
his name on the transplant list if he can get moved to
Pennsylvania, and if he can raise the $278,000 need-
ed to pay for the transplant

The King family, surprisingly, supports moving
Ray and giving him the liver. They, among a few
others, believe Ray might not be solely responsible
for the murder, that perhaps others acted with him,
but because there was no trial, evidence to support
this hypothesis never came out and the theory was
never proved. They would like to keep Ray alive
long enough to get a trial,-so that this theory can be
further investigated.

‘ Because he is a human being, and because we
should choose to judge him neither by the color of
his skin nor by the content of his character, Ray
should receive the transplant, but not just because
somebody else is willing to bargain with him for jus-
tree.

If Ray knows anything about the murder, he
should speak up and try to ﬁnd a sympathetic judge,
but his silence should not be used to keep him alive,
and to have the family and friends of someone he
confessed to killing running fund raisers to help him.

Of course, there’s no way to enforce this, to
make people behave the way we think they morally
should. But as a nation, we can do something to pre-
vent any kind of bargaining with criminals for organ
transplants.

If everybody in good health would be an organ
donor, the costs of transplants would come down,
and there would be enough available that nobody
would be ruled unworthy of a transplant simply
because of his age. Ray certainly shouldn’t be turned
down just because he is a criminal.

If everyone were organ donors, transplants
wouldn’t be considered a commodity to be traded for
justice. Justice belongs in the courts, not the operat-
ing rooms.

Thanksgiving: just for cheaper gas rates?

henry j. mason

Columnlst

As November draws to a close,
children all over America start think-
ing about turkey dinners and
Christmas wish-lists. College stu-
dents start to think about ﬁnal exams,
winter holidays and grade point aver-
ages (although if you’re anything like
me, that’s something you try to avoid
thinking about). Parents think about
snow tires and heating bills — and
Christmas wish-lists. Everything con-

sidered, it’s another normal
Thanksgiving in the land of life and
liberty.

If you lived in Iraq, on the other
hand, you wouldn’t have to think
about snow tires or heating bills or
ﬁnal exams. You probably wouldn’t
have to wony about your GPA. The
only thing you’d really have to worry
about would be staying alive. In fact,
if you were one of the 4,500 children
that the UN International Children’s
Fund estimate to be dying in Iraq
every month, you wouldn’t have to
worry about anything at all, ever
again.

But I wouldn’t want to ruin your
memories of a happy Thanksgiving.
Justtrynottothinkthatevery 10 min-
utes, as you ate your turkey or play
with the new computer that you get as
a Christmas present, one Iraqi child
dies as a result of the sanctions that
the United Nations imposed upon
Iraqin1991—andhasmaintained
ever since. Although the economic
sanctions are officially a result of a
UN decision, only those countries
that stand to beneﬁt by the destruction
of Iraq as a nation actually support the
sanctions. These are mainly the coun-
tries involved in the 1991 war against
Iraq: Britain, Israel, and of course, the
United States. And since nobody in

the UN wishes to incur the disfavor of i
this fair nation, the sanctions contin-
ue, unopposed.

If you listen to (most of) the rest
of the media, however, they will tell a
different tale. Most of the stories
recently have been about escalating
tension in the Gulf because of the
Iraqi’s refusal to allow the UN to
inspect their country for weapons and
war equipment. Actually, Iraq
requested that the inspection teams
contain no U.S. members — a not
unreasonable demand given that the
U.S. is hardly an impartial body in I
this conﬂict. As a result, the inspec-
tion teams were halted and Iraq is
“refusing inspection.” Another story
that gets a lot of press is that-Iraq is
hiding weapons of mass destruction
(as opposed to the US, whom we pre-
sume keeps its weapons of mass
destruction in full view) which stems
from Iraq’s reaction to the recent U2
spy plane ﬂights over Iraq —— they
moved their military equipment out
of sight. A truly sinister action,
indeed.

You may think, after reading all
this, that I am simply jaded and cyni-
cal. You would be right. But the UN
has done something for Iraq; the so-
called “oﬂ for food” deal worked out
last year allows Iraq to sell a limited
amount of oil in return for food and
medicines. The only problem with
this is that the majority of the money
goes for war reparations and what is
left is less than 10 percent of what
Iraq needs to feed its people. The
United States has stopped throwing
bombs, and is throwing crumbs
instead.

Actually, as far as the stated
intent of the sanctions is concerned,
they have been effective. Iraq

which I would rather not get too close
to) something which neither America
nor Israel would ever consider doing.
Iraq almost certainly can’t produce
any nuclear or chemical weaponry —
their only nuclear reactor was
destroyed during the initial bombard-
ment after the Kuwait invasion, as
were most chemical factories. Any
facilities that remain are nothing that
any industrialized country doesn’t
have. Coming from a nation with fast
breeder reactors, any criticism of
Iraq’s weapon producing capabilities
is ridiculously hypocritical.

But there is one thing that we
must never forget. Although the Iraqi
people are, on the whole, innocent
victims of the oil politics that have
always produced so much strife and
destruction in the Gulf region, there is
only one man behind the present con-
ﬂict. This man is responsible for the
continuation of the present situation.

His people are largely unaware of ‘

what is happening, powerless under
the control of this megalomaniac

whose evil face peers at us ﬁom the

and various other glossy publications.

His name is Bill Clinton.

Oh wait, I got that wrong. That’s
the other bad guy. The real bad guy is
called Saddam Hussein. Remember
that, folks. Know your enemy.
Saddam Hussein is the incarnation of
all that is evil. At least, as long as he
doesn’t do what America wants him
to. OK? _

Now that I’ve got that over with,
I hope you had a happy
Thanksgiving. I did. Then again, I do
live in the richest and most powerful

nation on earth. Oh well.

Each day, Pittsburghers board PAT
transit buses that cart them around the
city. The system is a vital and integral
part of transportation in the ‘Burgh.
Well, good ol’ PAT is headed for some
choppy waters, and guess who is going
to feel the crunch? Two potentially seri-
ous issues have come up that are impor-
tant not only to the workers, but to the

J general public as well.

I am a resident student, but I origi-
nally planned to commute. Having

attended high school less than a half

hour away, the majority of Pitt students
from my alma mater are commuters. I
sympathize with what they have to go
through to get to class every day. But
imagine what would happen if there
weren’t routes to get them to Pitt? Or
even worse, what if there weren’t any
buses running at all?
PAT Transit is
probably facing bud-
get cuts, as revealed in
the media recently.
They were considering
two options. Number
one: raise fares, or
number two: ‘cut
routes. The cutting
routes option seemed
to just be an
appendage to the usual
evening news, yet
when the rate hike was publicly pon-
dered, there was much more of a public
uproar. Looking at both sides, it’s pay-
ing more versus not being able to ride at
all. To me, the lesser of the two evils is
the price hike. It’s much less painful
than scrambling to find other ways to
get where you have to go. At least in
high school, if you couldn’t burn a ride

home from one of your friends, you.

could fall back on the, at that time,
dreaded and loathed buses. For many,
including college students, there is no
Plan B.

Neither option is particularly
appealing, but look at it from PAT
Transit’s standpoint. They’re getting
less funding from one source, and the
rest of the sources have stayed the
same. Compensation has to be made
somewhere, somehow. They can either
cut cost or add revenue to make up for
it, hence the route cut and price addition
options. It doesn’t seem like there’s any
light at the end of the tunnel. We just
have to deal with it and try to push for
the best path for us, the customers.

Also, as you read this, the PAT
workers’ contract has run out. There is a
mandatory “cooling off” period before
anything drastic could occur. However,
the possibility of a strike must be con-

sidered. This could prove disastrous for
all who use the system. Buses would be
later, and routes might be temporarily
cut among other things. It really isn’t
anyone’s fault if they do go on strike.
The workers probably just want to go
about their daily duties without any
fuss, but it is their right to fight for what
they deserve, just as it is with any other
unions. The point here is that we,
Pittsburghers, take the bus system for
granted.

Looking only at University stu-
dents, the commuters are affected the
most. But even the resident students use
the bus system. Who hasn’t taken PAT
to Squirrel Hill or Shadyside, or ridden
it down to CMU or Duquesne to visit
friends. How else would students get to
the grocery store since Giant Eagle left
Forbes? There are some other ways, but
very few. PAT buses are by far the most
practical option for Pitt students in
many ways.

Looking past
Pitt, there is the rest of
the city that is just as
dependent on these
buses. People rely on
them to get to work on
time, to go shopping,
to go out, to go any-
where for that matter.
Buses are boarded
every day, yet I hon-
estly don’t think peo-
ple realize what would
happen if the buses weren’t there to
pick us up just a few blocks away.
Whether it be a route cut due to budget-
ing, or strike-forced cutback, Pittsburgh
is going to be hurting. So don’t com-
plain about the possible rate hike  just
think of the other options and if you
want to deal with them.

Of course, climbing those steep
yellow steps at ungodly hours of the
morning and trying to hold on for dear
life by those leather rings when the bus
is crowded is definitely not at the top of
my or anyone else’s lists of fun things
to do. But it is a fact of life for many
here on campus and across the city.

There’s a poster in my biology lab
that says something to the effect of:
True wisdom is learning to do what has
to be done, when it has to be done,
whether you like it or not. Well, like it
or not, we need our public transporta-
tion system. So, speak up for what you
want from it, because if it isn’t there
when you. need it, we all will be at a
loss.

Jennifer Stoltz thinks that too many
people don ’t know what they've got till
it’s gone.

  

iracle finish caps miracle season

Patrick Robertson
Staff Writer

MORGANTOWN, W.Va. —— It was
fitting that the ‘Panthers’ Backyard
Brawl came down to a triple-overtime
thriller.

It was fitting that_ the matchup
against the Mountaineers, along with
Pitt’s bowl hopes, waited until after the
last possible second to decide itself.

It was fitting because three of
Pittsburgh’s 10 previous games were
decided in overtime or the last seconds
of regulation.

It was a ﬁtting end to a miracle of a
season.

After the 41-38 victory, Pitt Head
Coach Walt Harris dropped to his knees
at the 45-yard line. “I don’t know if I
deserve to witness something like this,”
Harris said.

Both teams fought hard for 60 rnin-
utes, but that was not enough time to
decide the outcome. The score remained
knotted at 35. Pitt was ready.

“We had what we needed —— guys
who didn’t care if they played, just if we
won,” Harris said.

In the first overtime, Pittsburgh won
the toss and elected to let West Virginia
play offense. The Mountaineers ran
three plays, gaining just ﬁve yards.

‘They settled for a 37-yard field goal

attempt.

WVU kicker Jay Taylor, who had
earlier hit a 47-yard ﬁeld goal, pushed
this one wide left and opened the door
for the Panthers to win the_ game.

Pittsburgh put its faith in last week’s
hero, senior running back Billy West,
but he netted only one yard on two car-
ries. On third down and nine, Coach
Harris decided to attempt a 41-yard
field goal. v

The idea was to give the Panthers
an extra down in case of a bad snap. The

Hatiart’s clutch fourth-dawn catch kept the Panthers’ game-winning drive alive.

Murphy hauls in the game-winning touchdown in the Brawl’: third overtime.

snap was on target here, but kicker
Chris Ferencik’s effort barely cleared
the offensive line and was promptly bat-
ted out of the air.

In the second overtime, the
Mountaineers chose first and gave
Pittsburgh the ball. Quarterback Pete
Gonzalez, using a different play selec-
tion, went to the air and got four yards
on a strike to Andy Molinaro. On the
next play, though, he threw a ball that
Dave Lightcap intercepted.

That ended the drive. West Virginia
got the ball back with a chance to win
the game. .

Contrary to the hopes of th

 

Mountaineer faithful, that chance van-
ished when Marc Bulger handed the ball
to running back Amos Zereoue, who
coughed it right back up to the Panthers.

As the third overtime rolled around,
many people wondered if this game
would ever end, or whether either team
really wanted to win.

Not Pitt defender John Jenkins.

“I knew we would win when we got
off the bus this morning, and I wasn’t
worried going into triple overtime,”
Jenkins said.

The Panthers again chose ﬁrst and
elected to play defense; that is exactly
what they did.

West Virginia ran Zereoue and
threw an incomplete pass on its ﬁrst two
downs to net next to nothing. On third
down, Bulger dropped back to pass and
found himself on the turf after a sack by
Rod Humphrey. ‘

This left the Mountaineers with a
fourth down and 20 at the 35. They
attempted a 52-yard ﬁeld goal, which
Taylor nailed. Although their drive net-
ted minus 10 yards, the Mountaineers
had a 38-35 lead.

But it was now the Panthers turn,
and they were still very much alive.

Pitt ran West and gained two yards
before throwing an incomplete pass and
giving up a 10-yard sack. After the sack,

Overtlme, page 10

Overtime  
Brawl an
all-time classic

MORGANTOWN, W. Va. —- “I
don’t even like football, and I liked that
game.”

Those words, uttered by my friend
Sue, sum up exactly what kind of football
game Pitt fans witnessed on Friday.

Sue is an example of the stereotypi-
cal girl who knows nothing about sports.
She’s the type of girl that thinks “rushing
yards” involves fraternities and drinking,
and a “quarterback sack” is something
perverted.

You know the type. Try explaining
the concept of gaining 10 yards to get a
first down to them and you’d think you
were trying to explain integral calculus to
Butthead.

Now there’s nothing wrong with not
being a sports fan, but the point is that if
Sue enjoyed that game, it really must
have been one helluva game.

In fact, anyone -—— Pitt fan, West
Virginia fan, or opera fan —— who didn’t
enjoy the excitement and competitive fire
of Friday’s triple-overtirne thriller has no

~ business calling themselves human.

But for Pitt fans, the 41-38 win was
especially sweet. '

First off, there’s the state of Pitt foot-
ball. The program has been disgusting for
the entire decade, but now more than ever
it’s obvious that Pitt has turned the corner
and is well on the way to becoming a
force in college football again.

Then there’s this storybook season.
Since the end of the Penn State game,
when the Panthers showed they could
play with anyone, Pitt fans have been
eyeing up that magical number of six
wins necessary to qualify the team for a
bowl game. -

Heartbreaking losses to bad Temple
and Boston College teams deﬂated near-
ly everyone’s hopes of a post-season trip.
No way could Pitt win two of the final
three games against the top three teams in
the conference.

Not so fast, non-believers. Pitt came
damn close to beating Syracuse, then put
together‘ a dominating win over 15th-
ranked Virginia Tech.

That set the stakes at Friday’s season
ﬁnale higherthan a Grateful Dead fan in
a hot air balloon. The Mountaineers were
ﬁghting for a major bowl, and Pitt was
playing to go to a bowl for the first time
since 1989.

Underdog Pitt had to travel into the
hills of Morgantown and face a talented

Cummings leads Pitt to blowout win over St. Francis

Eric Mosley

Staff Wrlter

Following Saturday night’s basketball
game, Vonteego Cummings said he feels he
doesn’t get enough credit for his defensive
skills. He said he doesn’t want to hear that
he scored 20 points against the Red Flash.

Rather, he wanted to hear that he had
six steals, grabbed six rebounds and dished
out seven assists.

In any case, it was Cummings who
stepped up and once again provided the
leadership for a young Pitt squad, guiding
the Panthers to a 79-55 victory at St.
Francis.

Cummings’ leadership shined in the
early moments of the second half. Pitt and

St. Francis were knotted at 32 at halftime
when Cummings and company decided to
kick it into high gear.

“Coach Willard came in at halftime and
said ‘You guys can play like girls, or we can
go out and ﬁght and win the game,”’
Cummings said. “That brought us together,
and we wanted to go out and win the game.”

Head Coach Ralph Willard sat down
with Cummings following the loss to
Illinois State last Saturday and told him he
needs the junior to cany the team. However,
Willard told Cummings that to be most
effective he needs to ﬁnd ways to get his
teammates the ball.

“I like being in the leadership role,”
Cummings said. “I think it will make me a
better person on and off the basketball

court.”

It was the second consecutive road
game for the Panthers, who were trying to
recover from the 87-65 pounding they suf-
fered at Illinois State last Saturday.

Like the Illinois State game, Pitt came
out a little bit nervous, and as a result,
played tentative basketball in the first half.

“I was nervous about this game,”
Willard said. “St. Francis is a good basket-
ball team that plays hard. They dive for
loose balls and do the little things that help
win games.”

The game was only the second road
game of the season for the young Pitt team,
and this showed early.

“When things start to go wrong they
look around and question themselves,” said

Willard. “So we challenged them at half-
time, and they came out and did a really
good job.”

The Panthers shot 46 percent in the ﬁrst
half, but shot 54.8 percent in the second
half.

St. Francis center Eric Taylor was the
main reason the Red Flash hung with the
Panthers. Taylor, who was the sixth—best
rebounder in the nation last season, scored a
game—high 24 points and grabbed 13
rebounds.

Junior walk—on guard Chris Home got
his ﬁrst start as a Panther and scored three
points. His playing gave some breathing
time to sophomore Jarett Lockhart.

The Panthers also had three other play-
ers in double digits. Freshmen forward
Attila Cosby scored 14 points and guard
Ricardo Greer added 12, and sophomore
forward Issac Hawkins contributed ll
points.

Mountaineer team that was backed by
over 40,000 screaming hillbillies.

The “Backyard Brawl” is always
intense and exciting.

This yea_r’s game saw a couple of
records fall: wideout Jake Hoffart
grabbed nine passes, giving him a Pitt
record of 56 this year, and Pete Gonzalez
threw ﬁve touchdowns, giving him 30
this season, which shattered the old Big
East record of 26.

Like a good mystery novel, the plot
of the game took several twists and, at
times, both teams appeared to have the
game won. The three overtimes included
botched ﬁeld goals by both teams, a
WVU interception and a gift
Mountaineer fumble.

The plot reached a climax after a
West Virginia ﬁeld goal put the Panthers
on the brink of defeat as they faced an
impossible fourth and 17.

But Pistol Pete smoothly zinged a
pass Hoffart for the first down. The loyal
contingent of Pitt fans exploded into a
frenzy, and two plays later when
Gonzalez found Terry Murphy in the end
zone, the Panther faithful went nuts
again.

We hugged, we screamed, we high-
ﬁved. We gestured to the stunned West
Virginia fans that we’re number one (at
least I think that’s what that gesture
means).

Just how thrilling was Backyard
Brawl 1997? How about another quote:

“Wow, what an exciting game!”

Know who said that?

Out-of-conference scheduling lightens Panther load

Matt Mento

Staff Writer

The Pittsburgh Panthers men’s bas-
ketball season is underway with a tough
schedule that features 18 Big East
Conference rnatch-ups and eight non-con-
ference contests. Vonteego Cummings and
Kellii Taylor will lead one of the best
backcourts in the conference against 11
teams that earned post-season bids last
year.

Last season Pitt went 18-15, including
a two-game sweep of Connecticut, a
whipping of Vrllanova, and a win over
New Orleans in the NIT.

This season the majority of Pitt’s non-
conference opponents should not be much
of a threat. Seven of the team’s ﬁrst eight
games are against non-conference teams
that have had limited success in recent
years.

Last season Pitt embarrassed St.
Francis 79-42, and is expected to do the
same this year. Lafayette is still very
young and too inexperienced to give Pitt
any problems. It has had its hands full in a
weak Patriot League already this season.
Maryland-Eastem Shore does have an
experienced squad, returning the ﬁve
starters who nearly upset Coppin State in
their conference tournament, but will be
severely out-matched against Pitt size-

wise.

However, non-conference foes Navy,
St. Bonaventure and intra-city rival
Duquesne could give Pitt Coach Ralph
Wrﬂard a tough show.

Navy beat the Panthers 60-49 last

season. Navy is returning its four top scor— I

ers from last season who led the
Midshipmen to a Patriot League
Conference title and into the NCAA
Tournament only to lose in the first round.
Navy went 20-9 last season and should do
the same, if not better, this year.

Rival Duquesne will be no pushover
for the Panthers. Even though they only
went 9-18 overall last season, the Dukes
lost a tough game to the Panthers, 75-73.
They are returning three starters, including
Kevin Price, who should add to the
rebuilding frontcourt.

Finally, St. Bonaventure replaces
Bethune-Cookman on the schedule, giv-
ing Pitt more of a challenge than the
Daytona Beach-based Wildcats. Small
forward Rashaan Palmer leads a young
Bonnie frontcourt that went 14-14 last sea-
son and ﬁnished ﬁfth in the Atlantic-l0’s
Eastern Conference. The Bonnies play in a
rugged division and are still searching for
that big playmaker who will enable the
squad to contend with out-of-conference
teams like Pitt, but they are still a season
or two away from that status.

After Pitt is ﬁnished with the non-
conference squads, it faces a very compet-
itive Big East schedule. While most of the
Big East squads will prove tough for the
Panthers, Connecticut and Syracuse could
be the toughest.

Even though Connecticut could not
ﬁnd a way to beat-Pitt last season, the
Huskies are returning ﬁve starters this sea-
son. Coach Jim Calhoun led his squad to a
18-15 record, ﬁnishing sixth in the Big
East Six, and placing third in the NIT.

The Huskies will be weak under the
boards because they have no real depth in
the frontcourt. Sophomores Kevin
Freeman and Jake Voskuhl will need to
step up and take control down low.
Sophomore Richard Hamilton returns
after an excellent freshman year —— he
averaged almost 16 points and four
rebounds each game. Junior point guard
Ricky Moore will be a question mark this
season after injuries tainted most of his
sophomore season.

Orangeman Todd Burgan returns for
his senior year, skipping out on the NBA
draft to help lead a Syracuse_ squad that
went 19-13 last season and ﬁnished fourth
in the Big East Seven. Syracuse is looking
to rebound after losing in the ﬁrst round of
the NIT last year, and Burgan may be the
man to lead them further.

Burgan averaged 15 points and seven

PIT’! HOOPS SPECIAL EDITION

‘ The Coach

Ralph Willard talks of players past
and convocation centers yet to come

.1.

Rachel Lenzi and Eric Mosley
The Pitt News

Ralph Willard has many concerns this sea-
son, but he is not as concerned about the wins
and losses his team accumulates as he is with
how his talented crop of freshmen will be able
to handle the rigors of college basketball and
college life. He’s also concerned about how to
handle the rigors of a six—man lineup, depleted
by injuries.

And a promise made four years ago about
the prized convocation center — still a ﬁgment
of drawing boards and budget proposals —
lingers in his mind.

But the pressing concern is the health of
his athletes. Three of Wﬂ1ard’s top players,
Kellii Taylor, Kevin Leslie and John Finneman,
are all out with injuries, forcing the squad to
change its entire defense, which was originally
centered on the full-court press.

“\V1th six kids, how are you going to exe-
cute the press?” asked the coach. “It’s physical-
ly impossible, so we’re going to have to ﬁnd a

j way to shorten the games, make it a 28-minute
game rather than a 40-minute game. There are
so many fragile things, youth, inexperience,
and if we get in foul trouble we’re up the creek.
We have no answer to foul trouble. When you
play 10 guys, you don’t wony about it. Right
now we’re not in that situation. That’s our
problem right now, trying to ﬁnd a way to win
with a limited personnel.”

Taylor is out for six weeks with a stress
fracture he sustained in practice. Leslie had
surgery on his left knee to repair a meniscus
tear and will be out. four to six weeks.
Finneman had knee
surgery for tendonitis and

Big East play. But not enough to make it to the
elusive NCAA Tournament. Despite earning a

. National Invitational Tournament bid, the
Panthers could have capitalized with those
three players.

“I thought that last year was going to be
our breakout year,” Miller said. “Sometimes
things don’t go the way you want them to go
and you have no control over them. But you
can’t worry about things you can’t control and
unfortunately, the injuries we had, we’ve ana-

j lyzed it, gone over it, and they were just freak
happenings. Some things you can’t control.
You can only work with things you can control,
so I’m proud of what our players do in terms of
getting better, how hard they work and how
hard they play.”

The hard work ethic is what VV1llard’s
coaching emphasizes. Besides the focus on
school, combined with a daily team practice
schedule, Willard and his coaching staff give
the players individual work-outs and video
coaching everyday. This personalized focus

helps six freshmen adjust to college life, which '

includes overcoming homesickness.

“They go from being a really good player
in high school, a little taller, a little faster, you
can get away with things because you’re better
than everyone else. You get to this level and
everybody is quick, tall, athletic. You have to
learn what will make us successful at this level.
It’s a learning process.”

In that learning process, Willard isn’t plac-
ing high expectations on this season’s team,
although he admits that he sees the progress
that is being made and is pleased with the
development of each player.

“I try to instill an
attitude in the team to do

from stress fractures to bite wounds.

“Last year could have been not only an

Willard said. “But we lost Varga, Jordan and
Blount —-— and Varga and Jordan were never
really able to play. They couldn’t practice more
than 15-20 minutes a day because the doctors
wouldn’t let them practice, and we had to go
from game to game to see how much they

was a late NBA draft pick, although he was
later cut by Seattle.

When Wﬂlard talks of player improve-
ment, he is talking about developing as a has-
ketball playor, a student and a good human
being. Besides basketball, Willard has devel-
oped a program called Power of Education,
which emphasizes different oppommities the
University offers to its students.

Power of Education brings in former Pitt
athletes, professors and successful graduate
students who reiterate the importance of utiliz-

Willard was promised a new arena over four years ago. He's still waiting.

ing the University for purposes other than sim-
ply basketball.

This program helps the six freshmen make
the diﬂicult adjustment to college and helps the
returning players understand their teammates.
Starting the season with only seven players,
which includes ﬁve freshmen, will solidify the
transition from high school to college.

Despite the adversity the team has faced
thus far, \V1llard is pleased with its transition.

“We recruited six freshman, and they have
to contribute to us immediately for us to have a
chance to win. Not only don’t we have senior
leadership, [we have] only one upperclass play-
er, Vonteego Cummings. I think they’ve done a
great job of adjusting.”

Another big concern on Willard’s mind is
the adrninistration’s promise of the convoca-
tion center. When Willard took the coaching
job at Pitt after leading Western Kentucky into
the Sweet 16 of the NCAA Tournament, he was
told that the land for the convocation center
would be broken within two years. .

Four years later, VV11lard hasn’t even seen
the completed paperwork.

“That’s been frirstrating to me, but the
convocation center not being built, that’s one of
the primary reasons that I came.” The building
of the center was actually a stipulation in
Willard’s coaching contract.

“If we got that center,” he said, “it would
be an unbelievable situation. Without it, you
lose recruits for reasons you shouldn’t lose
them.”

Wﬂlard speaks from past recruiting expe-

rience; Pitt had a sure lock on a recruit from
Bulgaria, Vasco Evtimov, but upon viewing the
facilities, he wasn’t impressed with Pitt’s whole
package. Another recruit — Kevin Lyde, who
ended up signing with Temple —— compared the
Fitzgerald Field House to a high-school facili-
tY~ ’
“I took advice from people who have been
here and they told me that this could be a great
situation. It’s a great school, plus a campus near
the city, centrally located for recruiting, and a
lot of positives, but we lose kids for reasons we
shouldn’t. That is frustrating.”

Willard feels that the convocation center
should not only be built for basketball reasons,
but for social reasons as well.

“There is no place on this campus for peo-
ple to recreate on the weekend. What do most
kids do on this campus? Thursday night they
go out and party. Friday there’s no football
game, so they’re gone. That’s what a good
amount of kids on this campus do. So if you
have a place where you can recreate, that’s a
transpositive for this campus, especially being
an urban campus.”

Despite frustrations surrounding contract
stipulations and injured players, Willard focus-
es on the hard work his team has instilled and
the adversity the team has faced thus far.

“We have really good kids who are trying
to represent this University well and that’s all I
care about and what anybody in this University
should care about.”

is a
valuable
r e c r u i t .
Cosby was
also being
recruited by
A r i z 0 n a ,
Syracuse, St.
John’s, Massachusetts and
Seton Hall.
Strengths: Cosby, without a doubt,
is one of the quickest big men in the
nation. Only guards will be able to
run or make spin moves past him.
This speed will be especially valu-
able on fast breaks and during the
second half of games, when most
forwards are slowed by fatigue.
Cosby also possesses amazing
leaping ability. His jumps are quick
and high, which will lead to several
blocked shots. In fact, he averaged
four blocked shots a game his senior
year at Oak Hill. Through the first
two games of this season, Cosby has
blocked four shots: To put that into
perspective, one blocked shot per
game in college hoops is consid-
ered above average, even for an
experienced player.
In addition, his shooting touch is
good enough to allow for him to
shoot 15 feet away from the basket
effectively.

Cosby’s speed and outside
shooting could make him
tough for slower Big East
j big men to guard.

_ and shoot over

Weaknesses: At only 210 pounds, a
lot of larger forwards and centers in
the college ranks will be able to
push Cosby around under the basket.
Fortunately, Cosby feels confident
that his quickness will more than
make up for his
lack of size.
“With a
player like
J ahidi White
(6—foot—9, 270-
pound center

I’ll just take a
quick drop step

Cosby in mid-
October.

S h 0 o t i n g
Guard

Size: 6-foot—6,
190 lbs.

From: W.T.
Woodson HS;
Fairfax, Va.
Hype: He did
not play his
senior season
in high school
for injury rea-
sons but was an

and All-Region
honoree during
his junior sea-
son. He was
ranked as a
top-100 recruit

Weaknesses: For being a guard,
Finneman’s passing is only

mediocre. Also, he could use more
speed in his game, but this may
come after recovering from his knee
problems.

rgcruigng See: a much-needed presence
v 1 c e s undertt-e boards. STEPHEN FLORES

Finneman was also being looked at
by Villanova, Stanford, Providence
and Penn State.

Strengths: Finneman is one of the,
if not the, top three-point shooting
threats for Pitt. He’s deadly from
behind the arc, but needs a little bit
of time on the ﬂoor to get warmed
up.

Finneman can also play near the"
basket, with the ability to take it to
the hoop and the ability to grab
some rebounds.

Unfortunately, Finneman recent-
ly underwent surgery for the second
time on his knee and won’t be able
to play until January at the earliest.

Position: Small Forward
Size: 6-foot-8, 200 lbs.
From: East Liverpool HS; East
Liverpool, Ohio
Hype: Earned All-State honors three
times. Flores was also being recruit-
ed by Michigan State, Ohio State,
Notre Dame and Penn State.
Strengths: Flores’ biggest asset is
his shooting. With a smooth touch
on his shot, Flores can hit three-
pointers that most defenders won’t
be able to block because of his
height.

“Shooting the ball is my strong
point,” said Flores in September. “I
can draw bigger guys to the outside

or just shoot over smaller players.”
Additionally, Flores is a rather
adept passer. In his senior season at
East Liverpool HS, he averaged six
assists per game. .
A “He has good size, passes the
ball well, and is deceptively strong,”
said Head Coach Ralph Willard.
Weaknesses: Flores admits his
biggest weakness is his speed, or
lack thereof. He said he’ll have to

play differently to compensate for

that, though.

.“I’ll try to find other ways to do
it,” said Flores. “I want to make
quick moves. With a good first step
I’ll be OK.” .

Willard also pointed out that
Flores will need to add some
muscle to be able to bang
inside for rebounds.

RICARDO GREER
Position: Shooting
Guard/Small Forward 
Size: 6—foot—5, 225 lbs. 
From: Chesire Prep ‘
(Connecticut); New ‘
York, NY
Hype: Rated as a top-50 recruit by
many recruiting services. Earned
Manhattan Player of the Year honors
during his junior season, when he
played at George Washington HS in
New York City.

Strengths: Greer has quickly
become a formidable ,inside—outside
player for Pitt, meaning he’s able to
damage opponents both from the
perimeter and under the basket.
After the season’s first two games,
Greer averaged 14.0 points, 7.5
rebounds and 2.5 assists.

“He’s very strong and has good
moves,” Willard said about Greer
before the season.

Greer’s large frame is pure mus-
cle, including his tree trunk—like
legs. With his build, it will be diffi-
cult for opposing coaches to ask a
guard to cover Greer because he can
overpower a smaller player very
easily. I

But Greer creates match—up
problems for big men who try to
guard him as well, because he is
very quick and is capable of making
some razz1e—dazzle moves past
slower players.

In addition, he has tremendous
jumping ability. Like Cosby, Greer
can get high in a hurry for the occa-
sional block or a thunderous alley-
oop.
Weaknesses: Greer appears to
have a few glitches to work on
before wrecking complete havoc on
the Big East.

His outside shooting is mediocre

when he needs to put up a quick‘

shot. Through the first two games,
Greer made none of his eight three-
point attempts.

Also, he’s showing a few fresh-

team.

KEVIN LESLIE
Position: Power
Forward/Center
Size: 6-foot-8,
255 lbs.
From: Theodore
Roosevelt HS;
Washington, D.C.
Hype: Was named second team All-
District his senior season. He was
also named second team All-District
for football as an offensive tackle.
Strengths: Leslie’s biggest asset is
his imposing presence. His immense
size allowed him to bang under the
hoop for 14 points and 14 rebounds
a game in high school. In the exhibi-
tion game against California All-
Stars, he had one rebound for a put-
back basket in limited playing time.

Leslie, like Finneman, has knee
problems and won’t be able to play
until early to mid-December.

In early action this season, Greer’s
aerial assault has shown Panther fans
(and Panther opponents) how he
earned the nickname ”Showtime."

Shawn Watts/
Photo Editor

Weaknesses: Leslie’s speed is far
from stellar. He can get down the
floor to guard his man, but he
could have some problems with
quicker big men. .
Being a big guy in the confer-
ence known for physical basket-
ball games, Leslie will need to
register as many minutes on the
court once he’s back from his
injury to get ready for the
rough Big East play, beginning
at the end of December (except

Dame on Dec. 6).

MICHAEL SHIN ,
Position: Power Forward

Size: 6-foot-8, 230 lbs.

From: Monacan HS; Richmond,
Va.

Hype: Following his senior sea-
son, he was named District
Player of the Year and first team
All—Central Region. Also, Shin

nominee.

Strengths: Shin will also be
called upon to muscle up on
opponents near the basket. In
October, Shin said his biggest asset
will be his strength.

“I’ll try to be a strong rebound-
er,” he said. “Being a strong power
forward will be my role.”

After the first two games, Shin
has grabbed four rebounds in limit-
ed action, and has registered two
steals.

Weaknesses: Although faster than
Leslie, Shin is still no Speed Racer.-

His shooting is also suspect, hit-
ting zero of two shots and only one
of five foul shots through two
games.

“I’ll need to work on my outside
game and my shooting,” said Shin.

VonIeego's Ie to h

Cummings takes
his place as floor
general-for a
young Pitt squad

Ned Schano

Senlor Staff Wrlter

After leading his team in stretch-
ing drills before practice, Pitt Panther
guard Vonteego Cummings took the
first ball off the rack and began lead-
ing the Panthers in lay-up drills
before leading the Panthers in 5—on—5
Scrimmages just after he led the team

\ in 3-on—3 drills.

If you sense a pattern here, you’re
right: Vonteego Cummings is the
undisputed leader of the Pitt Panther
basketball team.

As one of the most exciting play-
ers in the Big’ East Conference,
Cummings warrants the role that he
has assumed.

“I think as a point guard, you’ve
got to be a leader,” Cummings said.
“But I was that last year.”

2 As a sophomore last season,
Cummings blossomed into one of the
Big East’s finest players and emerged
as Pitt’s “go-to” player late in the
season. He led the team in scoring

- with a 16.3 points per game average

while dishing out 140 assists. Those
numbers were good enough to guar-
antee second-team All—Big East hon-
ors.

This season, Cummings was
selected to the preseason All-Big East
first team. Cummings’ impact on the
Panthers has increased this season,
thanks to the loss of five Pitt letter-
men from a year ago.

Forward Chad Varga, center
Gerald Jordan and guard Jason Maile
were lost to graduation, while guard
Kevin Willard bypassed his final year
of eligibility to take a coaching
internship with the Boston Celtics.
Pitt also lost 7-foot center Mark
Blount to a failed stint with the
NBA’s Seattle SuperSonics.

While there is no denying that the
Panthers will have a new look this
season, Cummings said the changes
haven’t really affected him.

“You wish they were here,”
Cummings said about last year’s
players. “But we’ve got to play with
what we got.”

And what the Panthers have is
youth. Head Coach Ralph Willard
signed six freshmen to bolster his

VI!

team. While a player’s freshman year
is typically consumed with more
sideline cheering than playing, this
season, at least three of Pitt’s new-
comers will be counted on to con-
tribute significantly.

Cummings said he wants the
freshman to imitate his intensity in
practice while also following his lead
during games.

“[The freshmen] feed off me,”
Cummings said. “When they look at
me, they see me working hard. That’s
all I want them to do is work hard.”

Cummings said the role of team
leader is nothing new to him. Coming
out of Thomson High School in
Georgia, he was considered one of
the top 10 high school point guards in
the country. He was selected a third-
team Parade All-American while
averaging 25 points, 6.8 rebounds
and five assists a game.

After the departure of Chad Varga, Cummings has taken the leadership role.

HIGH’ 4

Cummings entered, his freshman
season at Pitt as the Preseason Big
East Rookie of the Year. He began his
first campaign impressively before a
fractured hand caused him to miss
eight games and hindered his
progress the rest of the year. After the
injury, Cummings went on to start
nine of the Panther’s last 10 contests
finishing his freshman season averag-
ing 6.4 points and 3.4 rebounds a
game.

Then came the standout sopho-
more season; now comes a junior
year for Cummings without any
seniors to fall back on.

The inexperienced Panthers will
have their work cut out for them the
first several weeks of the season as
redshirt sophomore guard Kellii
Taylor recovers from an ankle injury.
Taylor is expected to be out until
early January.

“[The freshmen] feed off
me. When they look at
me, they see me working
hard. That’: all I want
them to do Is work hard.”

—Vonteego cumming:

Taylor ranked third in the nation in
steals last season (3.2 per game) and
together with Cummings, formed one
of the nation’s top defensive back-
courts. His injury will have a dramat-
ic effect on Cummings because with
Willard gone, Taylor was the only
backup at point guard.

That means Cummings, who
averaged a team-high 34.2 minutes a
game last season, won’t be able to
take a break.

“I’m not looking to come out,”
Cummings said. “I don’t come out in
practice and I don’t come out in
games.”

While Cummings may not want
to come out of games, he said he also
doesn’t want to be the team’s sole
scoring threat.

“I don’t want to lead the team in
scoring, unless ” Cummings
paused, then added, “unless that’s
what it takes to win.”

He said he would rather lead the
team in assists than scoring. If his
wish comes true, it will be just one of
the many leadership roles that
Vonteego Cummings takes on this
season.

need help on defense, but will have no
problems on the offensive side with top
scorer Damian Owens returning for his
senior year. The Mountaineers went 21-10
last season, finishing third in the Big East
Six, defeating the Panthers in their only
meeting and losing in the third round of
the NIT.

The  Hurricanes rebuilt their
team and looked to make the NCAA tour-
nament last season before losing ﬁve in a
row late in the year. Miami has a height
problem — it doesn’t have any players
over 6—foot—7 in the frontcourt. The only
player that is 6-7 is junior forward Tim
James, who averaged 14 points a game for
the ‘Canes in 1996-97.

The Providence Friars face a difﬁ-
cult year now that Head Coach Pete
Gillen’s entire frontcourt has left. The
Friars are looking to rebuild their offense
after going 24-12 last season and finishing
second in the Big East Seven. Providence
fans must be patient and carmot expect the
same Cinderella squad that went to the
ﬁnal eight in the NCAA’s, only to be
stopped by eventual champ Arizona. The
team will be looking to win games with its
strong rebounding core, led by junior
Jamel Thomas.

Bringing up the rear in the Big East
Six and Seven will be Notre Dame,
Boston College, Seton Hall and Rutgers.

Big East Player of the Year Pat
Garrity returns to Notre Dame without a
prominent supporting cast. After going
16-14 last season, and ﬁnishing fourth in
the Big East, the Irish have only Garrity to
talk about. VV1th a weak backcourt, the
squad will have a difficult time contend-
ing within the conference.

Boston College went 22-9 last season
and ﬁnished in a ﬁrst—place tie in the Big
East Six last year. This season, however, is
a rebuilding one. The Eagles’ new Head
Coach Al Skinner takes over the reins of a
team that went to the NCAA’s second
round last year. The Eagles had a dismal
recruiting year, though, and have yet to
replace much of their lost talent, including
Danya Abrams and Scoonie Penn.

A small frontcourt will give the Seton
Hall Pirates problems with rebounding.
New Head Coach Tommy Amaker has lit-
tle to work with in his first season.
Backcourt guards Shaheen Holloway and
Level] Sanders will put points on the
board for the Pirates, but there is no depth
in the line-up past them. The Pirates, who
went 10-18 last year (sixth in the Big East
Seven), should improve with Amaker’s
experience at Duke.

The Rutgers Scarlet Knights also
have a new coach, Kevin Barmon, who
also has a challenging task ahead of him
in building a winning program. His team’s
major weakness is rebounding, the front-
court has a problem with a lack of height.
Rutgers, which went 11-16 last season,
will look to improve under new manage-
ment.

I.atia to Ieacl Lady Panthers

Howard and an
athletic freshman
class hope to climb
out of Big East cellar

Shannon Helm

 

Staff Writer

VV1th only two seniors to lead the team,
the Pittsburgh Panthers women’s basket-
ball squad looks to the upcoming season to
rebuild and gain experience.

So far, it’s working.

In the team’s season opener against
cross-town rival Robert Morris College,
the Lady Panthers pulled an impressive 62-
44 victory. Lady Panther Head Coach Kirk
Bruce said he was “very pleased with the
win...we were slow starting, but I really
think that our defense pulled us through.
Holding a team to 44 points is pretty good.”

When asked about the outlook of the
season, Bruce said, “We’re a very young
team, but we also have a lot of speed and
quickness. We have a lot more athletes on
this team than we’ve ever had before.”

Latia Howard, one of the team’s few
veterans, will head the team once again,
this time as a senior. She is injured and not
in the lineup now, but hopes to be an inte-
gral part of the team.

Last season, Howard started at center
in every one of the Panthers’ 30 games. She
led the team in scoring with an average of
14.9 points per game and also led in
rebounds with an average of 7.4 per game.

In the last game of the 1996-97 season,
Howard scored a game-high 25 points and
added ﬁve rebounds.

Helping to head the team this year will
be the squad’s only other senior, forward
and center Farrah Woods. Backing up
Alecia Balich at forward in all 30 games
last season, Woods is expected to make sig-
niﬁcant contributions to the team again this
year.

In the Lady Panthers’ regular season
opener, Woods scored a garne-high 15
points and added 10 rebounds to the victo-
ry.

Bruce said, “IfI had to pick a player of
the Robert Morris game, it would have to
be Farrah Woods. She is a very strong and

consistent player.

....|(|r|( afucg, (guard/forward),
    (for''

ward), and Nicole

Whitworth (guard/forward) are also
expected to make solid contributions to the
game.

Montesano missed the second half of
last season to a leg injury, but is expected to
rise to her potential as long as she is
healthy. She started all 15 games she
played in, scoring 78 points.

Starting alongside Montesano will be
sophomore guard Michelle Katkowski.
Last year, Katkowski averaged seven
points per game and totaled 65 steals. Other
sophomores who are expected to receive
playing time are guard/forward LaTonya
Lawrence, guard Tarnica Hunter, and
guard/forward McKenzie Kreuger.

Four faces are new to the Lady
Panthers this year. Look for the young tal-
ents of freshmen guards Rasheedah
Akram, LaTonya Blanton and Monique
Toney, and forward/center Kenosha
Chastang. In the game against Robert
Monis, her regular season debut, Toney
recorded six steals.

Height will be a major advantage for
the Lady Panthers. Seven of their players
are at least six feet tall, and only one player
is under 5 feet 8 inches tall. The team’s
tallest member is sophomore Nickeia
Morris, at a towering 6-foot-7.

Coach Bruce explained that versatility
is also a Lady Panther strength.

“We are going to expect the unexpect-
ed this year,” he said. “We have six new
players, and a few of them are walk-ons.
They are looking pretty good. We will just
go out there and give it everything we’ve
got.”

One weakness of Bruce’s team could
be injuries. Balich suffers from hip and

lcnee problems, and Hunter has been hav-
ing shin splint difficulties. Although they
are both playing, Bruce said that neither is
playing at 100 percent. Also, both Howard
and Montesano rrrissed the Robert Morris
game due to injuries. Bruce hopes that all
of his players will be healthy for the
remainder of this season.

Last season was a tough one for the
Lady Panthers. The team compiled only
eight wins out of 30 games played, and
only three of those were Big East victories.
Besides coming off of a disappointing sea-
son, the team has also lost two starters, for-
wards Melissa Thompson and Kelly
Senneca, to graduation.

This season is one of new players, new
hopes and new expectations for Coach
Bruce and his Panther team. The tearrr,
after coming off of their season opening
victory over the Robert Morris Colonials,
faces a tough 1997-98 schedule. They will
take on Syracuse, Vrllanova and Penn
State, all before Christmas. Last season, the
Lady Panthers lost to each of these teams.

Coach Bruce commented, “VV1th our
ﬁrst victory, we should start expecting
more from the players. We have to start get-
ting better.

“The schedule keeps getting tougher,
so we need to as well,” he added, “One
thing that we need is more students to
watch the games. Students need to hear that
women’s basketball is just as exciting as
men’s, and we need the support just as
muc .”

Pittsburgh’s next game is in Syracuse
on Wednesday. The Lady Panthers return
home Sunday, Dec. 7 at 2:00 p.m. to battle
Vrllanova.

Over the holiday, the Pitt women’s
basketball team suffered its ﬁrst loss of

the regular season to St. Francis

College, but recovered to capture sec-
ond place on in the Lady Panther

‘Invitational at Fitzgerald Field House on

Nov. 30.

The Lady Panthers lost a close game
to the Red Flash of St. Francis, 65-63.
The game got off to a slow start, with
neither team leading by more than two
points for the first eight minutes of play.
The Red Flash pulled ahead, however,
scoring 11 points with 6:15 left in the
ﬁrst half.

That 21-11 St. Francis lead was
diminished though, as the Lady Panthers
closed the gap to within three points of
the lead by the halftime buzzer. Seven of
Pittsburgh’s 16 points were scored in the
last six minutes of the first half by Lady
Panther junior forward Alecia Balich.

Like the opening minutes of the
game, the second half began in favor of
the Lady Panthers’ opponent. The Red
Flash jumped ahead by eight points, to
lead 43-35 less than 13 minutes into the
second half. Pitt answered, however,
producing 12 points in the next three
minutes of play to take a 47-45 lead.

In the ﬁnal nine minutes of the
game, the lead changed ﬁve times. With

just 19 seconds left in the game, the Red
Flash took the lead with a layup, and a
St. Francis free throw ended the battle.
In the Lady Panther-Invitational on
Nov. 29 and 30, Pittsburgh earned a sec-
ond-place ﬁnish with a victory over the
Lady Bears of Morgan State in the first
round and a loss to Richmond in the
championship game. i
In the first round, the Lady Panthers
defeated Morgan State by a ﬁnal score
of 55-43.  ‘
The scoring began with a layup by
Pittsburgh junior guard Gina Montesano
in the first minute of play. The Lady
Panthers held on to the lead for the

Montesano totaled a team-high 12
points and was second on the squad with
three steals. Sophomore center Nickeia
Morris was a defensive powerhouse,
totaling a game-high 16 rebounds. She
also recorded nine points and four
blocks in the contest. Contributing a
game-high four steals and second on the
team with six points was freshman
guard/forward Rasheedah Akram.

In the invitational’s championship
game, the Lady Panthers were defeated
by Richmond, 85-71, dropping
Pittsburgh’s season record to 2-2. The
Lady Panthers took a four-point lead

early in the first half, but the Spiders of
Richmond quickly answered and led 43-

der its lead for the rest of the contest.

For their impressive efforts in the
Lady Panther Invitational, Pittsburgh’s

defensive back Perlo Bastien, hauling
down the.Gonzalez pass for a touch-
down, clinching the Panther win.

Most importantly, Murphy’s catch
meant that the Panthers, after five
straight losing seasons, were going to
their first bowl game in seven years.

“Our football team deserves a
chance to playin a bowl game,” Head
Coach Walt Harris said after the game.
“We earned the right and we deserve
an opportunity. This is the way college
football should be played.”

Gonzalez once again had an out-
standing game for the Panthers, pass-
ing for 273 yards and five touch-
downs. His 30 touchdown tosses this
season shattered the Big East’s mark
of 25 set by Boston College’s Glenn
Foley in 1993.

The quarterback’s efforts earned
him Big East Offensive Player of the
Week awards for the second time this
season and kept him in the running for
Big East Player of the Year awards.

But Gonzalez wanted to focus

more on the team’s efforts than indi-
vidual accolades.

“We couldn’t have made it any
more dramatic -— it was incredible,”
Gonzalez said. “We blew some
chances early in the season [but] we
really jelled throughout the second
half of the season.”

The game started out well for the
Mountaineers. A six-yard scamper by
running back Amos Zeroue capped an
80-yard, 13-play, opening drive as
West Virginia raced to a 7-0 lead.

After the Panthers’ first drive
stalled, senior running back Billy West
put the Panthers on the board with a
13-yard touchdown up the middle.

With the score tied 7-7, the
Panthers’ fourth -possession turned out
to be history making. The drive
opened with a seven—yard reception by
Hoffart, his 55th catch of the year,
breaking Dietrich Jells’ single season
reception record of 55 set in 1992. The
drive finished the way it started, with
Gonzalez hooking up with Hoffart on
a 16-yard touchdown.

After a 47-yard field goal by West
Virginia’s Jay Taylor, Pitt expanded its

Mother

lead to 21-10 late in the half. Gonzalez
and Murphy hooked up for their first
of three touchdowns on a 27-yard
strike in the right corner of the end
zone.

WVU opened the. scoring in the
first half, with Zeroue, who finished
the game with 151 yards on 41 carries,
rushing for two more touchdown runs,
sandwiched in between a 10-yard
touchdown pass from Gonzalez to
Murphy. Following the scoring ﬂurry,
the Panther lead was cut to 28-25.

A nine-yard, one-handed Juan
Williams touchdown reception in the
fourth quarter pushed the score to 35-
25 in favor of the Panthers. But West
Virginia fought back, scoring on a 53-
yard pass from Mountaineer quarter-
back Marc Bulger to Pat Green and a
34-yard field goal by Taylor. The
score was tied at the end of regulation,
setting the stage for the Panthers dra-
matic triple overtime victory.

“Zeroue said it’s not a Backyard
Brawl when one team physically dom-
inates another team year after year,”

‘Murphy said. “I guess it’s a Backyard

Brawl now.”

 FROM PAGE 6

the Panthers took a timeout to talk the
play over.

It would be nearly a 50-yard ﬁeld
goal for Ferencik, who hadn’t hit on any-
thing longer than an extra point all game.
So, with one last chance to continue the
season, Gonzalez led the offense back
out.

“It was not in his range,” Harris said
of the kick.

So, Gonzalez dropped back and
riﬂed a 21-yard pass to Jake Hoffart,
who hauled it in to keep the Panthers
alive in the game.

“We threw it to the right guy, and he
got the necessary yards,” Harris said.

The next pass fell incomplete, but
instead of playing a conservative, run-
oriented game as they had earlier, the
Panthers sent sophomore Terry Murphy
on a post route into the end zone.
Gonzalez hit him with the quarterback’s
ﬁfth touchdown pass of the day and his
30th of the season, setting a new Big
East record.

"‘As soon as I caught the ball, I
thought, God, don’t let all of these peo-
ple jump on me. I don’t want to be at the
bottom of this pile,” Murphy said.

The Panthers’ post route was only
about the third they had run all day, but
Coach Harris thought it would work if
his players executed perfectly. They did.

“Terry [Murphy] got it done, and
Pete [Gonzalez] put it where it shields
the defender,” the coach said.

The catch gave Murphy three touch-
downs on the day, but more importantly,
it gave the Panthers a winning record, a
bowl-eligible season and a ﬁtting finale
to a year of surprises.
