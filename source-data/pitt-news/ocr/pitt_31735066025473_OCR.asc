Black studies Professor Rollo Turner
said he did not appear at the faculty
hearing that discussed the legitimacy of
his January suspension because hedid not
want to give any credit to the charges.

“I didn’t appear because I didn’t want to
dignify or honor politically motivated
charges,” Turner said.

Former black-studies department
Chairperson Dennis Brutus, who issued
Turner’s contract, also declined to appear
at the hearing.

“I declined because I felt that [Turner]
had not, as far as I could judge, been
accorded due process and the hearing
would amount to a ‘kangaroo court,”’
Brutus said. “It seems to me that a grave
error was made which should be speedily
corrected and compensated for,” he said.

urner refuses to appear at hearing

Brenda Berrian, who requested that
Turner’s contract be terminated, had no
comment concerning the hearing.
According to Turner, the fact that he
does not believe in teaching from an

Afrocentric point of view, as Berrian does, ,

is the source of many of their differences.

“I think Afrocentricity is another kind of
ethnocentricism,” Turner said.

“I [teach Afrocentricallyl all the time.
Everybody in the department, including
me, [teaches Afrocentrically] all the time,”
Berrian said.

Turner’s suspension and possible

termination resulted from his refusal to
teach an additional class this semester, he
said. .

Turner said there is no provision in his
contract that says he must teach additional
classes.

On the first day of classes, Jan. 6, 1992,
Turner said Berrian publicly announced

Turner said he questioned Berrian about
his due process and asked her to put the
statement in writing. Turner said Berrian
told him “‘it already is in writing.” Turner
said he then left the conversation.

Turner said he received a letter from
Berrian Jan. 9 informing him that he was
suspended because of his refusal to teach
a third course in the spring term.

Friday, Jan. 10, Berrian appeared in

Turner's class with two campus police .

officers who escorted him off campus.
Berrian told the students in the class that
Turner had been suspended.-

“I really unfortunately feel the University
of Pittsburgh has the unfortunate legacy
and shame of having one of the only
faculty members in the U.S. that has been
removed in front of their students,” Turner
said.

In a memo Berrian sent to the faculty I

Chair of the black studies department

BAS. still
far from
achieving
14 points

By Alissa Smith

’ and Maria‘Muzzie

The Pitt News

The Black Action Society"
received national coverage last
spring when it said it could no
longer recommend Pitt to high-
school students unless 14 points
of change were met. One year
later, it is still 15 shy.

Although the Black Action
Society is no longer speaking
about the recommendations,
Justin Laing, co—author of the 14
points, and Marcus Guy,
chairperson of the BAS, both said
they will not recommend Pittto
a friend or relative.

“We have never changed our
views from last year,” Laing said.
“We said it, and we have not
reversed our stance.” ’

Guy said that cooperation with
the administration in completing
the programs is now the BAS’
main concern —— not the
discussion of the question of
recommendation.

BAS members said they are

' currently working on a document

that will go directly to Pitt
Chancellor J. Dennis O’Connor.
The document will demand a yes
or no answer to action solving
issues concerning African-
American students on campus.
Members said this is more
favorable because it allows issues
to be addressed at once, rather
than point by point,

“Then we will have finally
reached the level we should have
reached last year,” Laing said.

See BAS, page 5,

that he was fired from the university.

Proffmds most diszfom t quasar

By John Temple

Stajf Writer

A three-member team of astronomers,
including Pitt Professor Cyril Hazard, verified
the discovery of the most distant lensed quasar
known.

“The discovery of this very distant lensed
system will provide astronomers with an
opportunity to explore the structure and
distribution of matter in the most distant regions
of-the universe,” Hazard said.

Lensed quasars such as this one will
eventually allow scientists to study otherwise
undetectable objects in space, according to
Hazard. ‘

Quasars radiate energy at a rate exceeding
that of-100,000 billion stars and are believed to
result from matter falling into massive black
holes in the center of a galaxy. ’

A lensed quasar is a quasar whose light is
bent by a massive object between the earth
and the quasar. In this case, the light from the
quasar is split into two, most likely interrupted
by a‘ galaxy too faint to detect.

The intervening galaxy acts like a, giant lens,

distorting and magnifying the quasar’s light
into two images. _

“Studying [the lensed quasar] further will
give us an idea of the density of its invisible
lensing matter,” Hazard said.

Only a dozen lensed quasars have been
discovered in the past 13 years. '

Hazard’s team, which also includes Dr.
Richard McMahon of the Institute of Astronomy
at Cambridge University and Mike Irwin of the
Royal Greenwich Observatory, has discovered
virtually all of the known, distant, bright
quasars.

Earlier this year the team discovered the
quasar from a telescope on Mauna Kea, Hawaii,
and last week new information from the William
Herschel Telescope at La Palma in the
Canary Islands proved it to be a lensed
quasar.

Hazard, who teaches classes at Pitt, is.

 beginning a program which will involve quasars

even more distant than the one recently
discovered.
“In another program over the next year, we

will be probing the intervening matter [of '
‘lensed quasars_],".'he said. ' I

THE PI’-IT NEWS, Wednesday, April 15, 1992

 

Remember the promises you
made to yourself in the beginning
of the semester: Read all
assignments, study every day,
form study groups, complete
assignments early and never miss
a class. However the demands of
work schedules and the desire to
have a social life soon made us
realize that maybe our
expectations were a little too high.
Now the end of the semester is
near

In preparation for finals, you
realize that you need to read an
unbelievable amount of assigned
work and memorize pages upon
pages of notes for each class.

 

With FRANKLIN
CARTER

And, of course, most of your
papers and tests are scheduled
for the same day.

The week of finals is the
culmination of the semester's

demands. It is no wonder that the
symptoms of stress are more
pronounced during this time

A period. These symptoms include

insomnia, headaches, fatigue,
nausea, tension and backaches,
to mention a few.

The word “stress” is derived
from a Latinword meaning “to
draw up tight.” If this feeling of
“tightness” continues, it can be
physically and mentally harmful.
A release of this “stress” or
pressure can be accomplished by
exercise and relaxation
techniques, such, as deep
breathing and progressive
relaxation. O

ﬁts finals get nearer, stress levels getnigher

During this time it is important
to eat well—balanced meals, avoid
caffeine, alcohol and sugary
snacks. Walking, biking, jogging
and swimming are excellent ways
to relax and renew energy. If
possible, try to get enough sleep
since it will help you in being
alert, less irritable and better able
to manage stressful situations.

The Finals Week Survival
Workshop is designed to help
students learn coping skills in
order to handle the stress
associated with the end of the
semester. Even though finals
week is a stressful event, you can
survive.

Greek Week Cbozir named

By Heather Gahres
Staff Writer

The Panhellenic Association

elected Heather Nachtmann of .

Chi Omega next'year’s Greek
Week overall co—chairperson at
its final meeting of the term
Monday.

Nachtrnann joins Steve Donofe‘

ofPi Kappa Alpha as Greek Week
overall co-chair. The two worked
together this past year as dance
marathon co—chairs.

“Heather’s the organizer, and
I’m the talker. We work well
together,” Donofe said after
Nachtmann’s election.

Nachtmann said her experience '

with dance marathon gives her
insight into some of the behind-
the—scene problems involved in
Greek Week. She also said
working on the dance marathon
gave her opportunities to work
with Roy Rogers, one of the main
corporate sponsors of Greek
Week.

“lt’s important that the overall
[chairs] don’t favor one house.
They must remain impartial to
everybody,” Nachtmann said.

Nachtmann also discussed the
feasibility ofeliminating canning
asa fund raiser next year. She
said that many people have
mentioned the dangers involved
with canning, such as dodging
traffic. She said that it was not
feasible to fully eliminate canning
because Greek Week would lose
up to $100,000.

She said she would like to
make the phone—a—thon bigger
and sponsor some specific fund
raisers, like a car wash, to alleviate
the burden of canning.

Immediately following the,

election, Nachtmann and Donofe
began making the initial plans for
Greek Week 1995. C

“We’re going to begin working
on picking the business manager
and event chairmen,” Nachtmann
said.

The main project will then be
picking the charity for Greek
Week. “We’ve had over 10
applications for the charity.
[Picking the charity] will be the
biggest task for us,” Donofe said.

for high-risk heart patients

By Holly Affeltranger
S luff’ Writer

For those who have poor heart functions,
severe artery disease or have had numerous
heart operations, the University of Pittsburgh
Medical Center has an innovative cardiac surgery
program that can help high—risk patients receive
heart transplants they may not otherwise have
been eligible for.

The program is for high-risk patients and
includes the use of mechanical heart assist
devices by surgeons while they are performing
heart transplants.

The UPMC has already operated on such high-
risk patientsthat have been on waiting lists for
heart transplants. —

With this program for high—risk patients,
surgeons were able to repair the heart and
remove the patient from the transplant waiting

. list.

To reduce the risk in these patients, the UPMC
surgeons use mechanical—heart assist devices.

“Because of our clinical and research work in
artificial heart implantation, we also have available

to us an array of ventricular assist devices that

can be used as a means of support during
temporary cardiac failure for patients that cannot
be weaned from the heart lung machine following
otherwise successful surgery,” Dr. Brack Hattler,
co—director of the program said.

Hattler said this program may not be available
to other medical centers and hospitals, because
at the University of Pittsburgh there is “a great
commitment of resources and man power to
take care of these sick patients.”

Though all the patients involved in this program
are in the high-risk group, -Hattler said the
possible benefits of surgery are always greater
than the risk involved with such a serious
surgery. _

“In this population of patients, there was no
upper limit where cardiac disease was so severe
that the risk outweighed the potential benefit of
surgery,” he said.

The UPMC has done more than 780 heart,
heart/lung, double lung and single lung
transplants.

They also have implanted more assist devices —

than any other medical center.

‘ By Suzann Gries
Staff Writer

A television series from the 19605 has inspired die—hard fans
to form a club on Pitt’s campus.

The Prisoner Club, named for the television show “The
Prisoner,” meets every week to watch and critically discuss
episodes of the television show.

“We had been into ‘The Prisoner’ for a year and a half, and
basically we started with three guys and grew to about five,”
club President Joe Foner said.

Chris Kocher, one of the original members, said, “We plan on
showing episodes and spreading what it’s all about.”

“The Prisoner” stars Patrick McGoohan, an English actor who
was popular in the 19603. .-

Because of his popularity, McGoohan was able to convince
a television company in England to give him complete artistic
control over the show.

The themes of each episode are political and surrealistic.
McGoohan used individualistic techniques in developing the
show.

“The Prisoner” is a story about an undercover intelligence
agent who resigns from his position as a “top secret agent.”
Before he can leave the country, the agent (played by McGoohan)
is kidnapped and taken to a village where unseen forces are

trying to uncover his secret.

BAS

Continued front page 1

The BAS’ actions began last year with a
press conference to explain university
conditions that it felt were adverse to
African-American students.

The organization said it “could no longer
recommend the University of Pittsburgh
because of deficiencies in the social,
academic, political and cultural
atmosphere.”

The factors that it said caused the
deficiency are that seven of every 10
African-American students who enter Pitt
do not graduate; the cultural and social
environment that does, not nurture African-
American students; three percent of all
university faculty are African-American and
the university refused to allow the BAS to
put a student on the presidential-search
committee. ,

Among the BAS Political Action
Committee’s 14 points of improvement
that would make Pitt recommendable were:

A plan must be released to hire counselors
every year to help BAS organize study
groups for a large population. The UCEP
financial-aid budget should reﬂect the
increase in cost of living and inflation of
tuition. A fund should be established for
cultural entertainment to help bring a
better social atmosphere‘ to the university.
The black—studies department should be
expanded to make the two part—time faculty
members full—time, and an economist and

an art historian must be added. Increase .
the number of black faculty in each I

department to reflect the percentage of

those blacks who hold doctorate degrees,

in that field. A plan from the university on
how it plans to retain and hire African-
American faculty must be developed. A
definitive plan from the university with
numerical goals and time tables dealing

What kind of university
doesn’t study issues of this
nature-——unless of course,
they consider the issues

-Justin Laing

with the above mentioned problems have
to be completed. Members of the Board of
Trustees must appoint a committee to
study these problems and produce a report
on them before the end of the Spring 1991
term. The BAS and the black—studies
department must have substantial
representation on this committee.

In response to the points, former Pitt
President Wesley Posvar promised to raise
both ﬁnancial aid and the number of
African-American faculty members.
Financial aid was increased, but the amount
of African-American faculty remains
unchanged.

“Promises aren't as important as
programs,” Laing said. “We’re only saying
that if you’re going to recruit us here, we
want you not to give us anything but to
make sure you educate us in the way we
want to be educated with the money we
gave you to educate us.” '

Posvar also commissioned a committee '

composed of -representatives from the
Office of Student Affairs, the Office of the
Provost, Black Action Society members
and the director of the Office of Affirmative
Action. . .

The 14 points still have not been
responded to in a centralized way because

the issues being talked about,” Laing said.

Guy described Posvar’s response as an
issue of commitment. “We’ve received a
lot of flowery talk and lip service saying,
‘We'd like to do that, but  ‘ As for putting
together well-established programs
supported by the administration, we
haven’t seen that on these issues,” he said.

Many of the issues in progress this year
are largely based on the issue of retention,
Guy said. Retention is the financial aid,
counselling, advising, faculty,
administration and attitudes toward a
particular group’ on campus.

Guy said that retention in terms of Pitt’s
African-American population needs well-
established programs that are supported
by both the administration and faculty. He
explained that many programs for African-
American students only reach student
activists — not those who need the most
help.

The administration is unaware of the
many facets of the problem and that the

' major question to be posed is, “When are

you going to study this with all the resources
that you have  What kind of university
doesn’t study issues of this nature —
unless of course, they consider the issues
irrelevant?” Laing said.

He said he is unsure whether these
issues are relevant to O’Connor.

“IfI were a betting man, I would bet it’s
not one of his top priorities  I wouldn’t
judge the man’s heart because I don’t
know it, but I will judge that he is not well-
versed in the issues of African-American

students,” Laing said.

He added that the administration must
find a way to centralize and then move on
with these retention problems. “They would
shut down the University of Pittsburgh if
everyone had the retention statistics of
African Americans. It would not get
certification, but yet they allow this problem
to dwell,” Laing said.

Laing said he does not expect the

administration to be able to resolve these ‘

problems by tomorrow, but he said more
action needs to be taken.

“The university didn’t respond because
it isn’t in their nature to respond to the
education of different people for their
own promotion,” Laing said. I

Laing explained that while it is the’
university’s duty to prepare students for

the job force, African-American students
needto become better culturally educated.
He said that African-American students
“not only have to be prepared for the
future, [they] need to be prepared to
rectify the past.” _

He said that the university isnotequipped
to‘ deal with this type" of education, yet
African-American students are paying
money, like everyone else, to be educated
in a certain way.

Guy said that African-American students

have been educating themselves through
their constant struggle for change in the
university.

Though last year’s 14 points created
little concrete results, both Guy and Laing

said it was an important learning

expenence.

“We learned some major things about
education’, our base, knowing who is
responding and the importance of
organizing,” Laing said. He said his outlook

remains both patient and positive toward"

obtaining more substantial results.

before the incident occurred, she
informed them how they should
‘deal with the media.

“If you should be approached
V by either the university or local
‘ media about Rollo Turner’s
allegations, simply state ‘No
‘comment,’ or ‘This is an internal
personnel issue,”’ Berrian said in
the memo.

“I have been a faculty member

has been extraordinary," T urner,

 

said. “I am a researcher and the
leading authority on the history
of blacks in Pittsburgh. For 22
years there were no problems.
All of a sudden, within two
months, there is a problem with
me and I see it as poli-tically
motivated."

“Berrian’s first action as chair
of the department was to reduce
my salary,” Turner said. “Berrian
suspended me without pay and
recommended that I be dismissed
— I’ve never heard of a chair
doing this.”

Jan 21, dean of the faculty of
arts and sciences Peter Koehler
sent a memoto Pitt Chancellor J.

Dennis O’Connor in which he
said, “with the concurrence of
Provost Donald Henderson, I am
requesting that you terminate the
non-tenure stream appointment
of Mr. Rollo Turner  Mr. Turner’s
termination should be for cause,
prior to the expiration of his
current contract.”

Koehler then said in the letter
that first it would be necessary to
“seek the advice of a University
Hearing Board, pursuant to the
University’s Bylaws.”

Koehler included the list of
charges “constituting insubordin—
ation and dereliction of duty

performance, conduct, and
behavior as a member of the
faculty.” '

The list of charges said that
Turner did not accept the
additional class, and because he
did not produce any evidence of
scholarly research in the past
four years his teaching load
should be increased to a level
appropriate for faculty members
outside the'tenure stream of
whom no scholarly work is
expected.

Koehler’s list also said that
Turner failed to prepare and
submit materials for the three
upper-level courses he was to

design over the next three years.

The third and final charge said
“despite reasonable directives
form the Chairperson of his
Department, Mr. Turner has failed
to submit the documentation for
his two existing lower level
courses.”

Law Professor Ronald A. Brand
then accepted O’Connor’s request
that he serve as the chairperson
of the hearing board.

Because the board could not
reach a decision, the matter will
be taken over by a special comm-
ittee of the board of trustees,
which will then make a recomm-
endation to the entire board.

No second helpings

One issue gaining attention during this year’s presidential
election has been welfare reform.

For many years, beginning with the Reagan campaign
for presidency, the invention of a “welfare mother”
occupies discourse in social welfare policy.

The “welfare mother” sat around unwilling to work and
would get pregnant to collect thousands of dollars of
welfare benefits, according to the myth. This image of
welfare recipients, no matter how unfounded, determines
policy. - .

On Friday, the Bush‘Administration gave the green light
to the state of Wisconsin to cut relief to teenage mothers
receiving welfare benefits.

The restrictions apply to women with children who
receive benefits. Bush has sanctioning reductions and a
cap on poverty relief for children.

The plan applies to women under the age of 20 who
are first-time mothers. Cites include Milwaukee and
three counties in Wisconsin over the next few
years. ,

Under the plan, a single mother living in Wisconsin and
qualifying for benefits receives $440. This will not change.
However a mother with two children, who used to
receive $517, will only obtain $479 in support from
the federal Aid to Families with Dependent
Children. ’ I i

A mother with three children who used to receive $617
will get the 4same $479 of support for her family.

Criticism’ came swiftly. David S. Liederman, executive
director of the Child Welfare League of America,_referred
to the cuts as “outrageous,” and, according to the Associated
Press, said, “Aid to Families with Dependent Children is
the largest children’s program in the country, serving
eight million children. By withholding benefits to their
parents with the intent of modifying behaviors, we end up
hurting the very children we seek tohelp.”

Liederman also noted most recipients of Aid to Families
with Dependent Children are mothers with two children.
They obtain support for under two years on
average. ' _ V

The Bush Administration is encouraging other states to
follow the lead of his “progressive” reforms. It is hopefully

V unlikely any state or local government wouldfollow the .

lead.

Starving children by cutting support is barbaric. Punishing
women and children, who do qualify for support but do
not meet Bush’s idea of who should reproduce, is not
surprising.

Pittsburgh is the site for incredibly high infant-mortality
rates. Byaggravating high U.S. infant mortality, the cap
and cuts will make a bad situation worse.

Animal testing: how do they study?

Sunday afternoon one of the
most astonishing things came to
my attention. I was watching
“CNN Headline News,” waiting
for the score of the Yankees
game, when one of those factoids
popped onto the screen —— those
useless bits of information that
flash onto the screen at the end of
each segment. The factoid read,

- “Seventy-two percent of American
woman would prefer if their
cosmetics weren’t tested on
animals.”

Stunned by this tidbit of
information, I began to wonder
a) why they were actually telling
me this and b) who would dress
up animals with cosmetics. In my
eager search for an answer, I
-quickly sought the help of one
whom I feel to be an authority on
animals: my dog, Indy. She was
kind enough to inform me that,
indeed, they do try out cosmetics
on animals. I was awestruck.

“But why?” I asked.

I was shocked to learn that in
the basements of .many major
cometic factories there are actually
farms. Yes, indeed, each animal
was used to test. a different type
of cosmetic. Puppies‘ with false
eyelashes would walk down the
hallways, making passes at cats
wearing lipstick. Donkeys and
horses would dance around

“Tell me more,” I said in
anticipation, and tell me she did.
I discovered that chickens are the
ones that test the hinges on the
compacts to make sure they open
and close properly, and aardvarks
make sure the powder is in order,
so that noses wont shine.

Later that day I thought about
what my faithful dog had shared
with me. I now know how they
test cosmetics.Now before anyone
gets the idea that I am in need of
psychiatric help, I realize there
are no farms in the basement, but
there are labs. It is fascinating
that with all the progress
civilization has made, there is still
the need to test make-up on
animals. And just think, ladies,

Now I am not bashing
cosmetics, and I am not a big
animal-rights activist (I do agree
with some lab tests), but I feel,
this is getting carried away. The re
has got to be another way of
testing to see if a product is safe
rather than painting, testing or
killing animals for the sake of
silky hair. I
The use of laboratory animals
to do health-related experiments
to further the advancement of
modern medicine is something
of a scientific nature that would
benefit all people. Many vaccines
couldn’t have been tested to
determine whether they would
have been safe for human use if
it weren't for lab animals. r
Perhaps one day someone will
develop an alternative to this

ridiculous practice. It makes about - _’

as much sense as bringing sand
to the beach. I'm sure that with all

the scientists theses companies a

have working for them, one can
develop a better way to test
products.Just something to think
about. And, by the way, my dog
really can talk.

O’Connor believes his strategy

recommendations concerning- the ROTC.‘ In
particular, the GPSA endorses recommendation
five: “That it be understood that the University of
Pittsburgh will notify the Defense Department that
it will not continue the ROTC program on campus
after 1997 if there are no appropriate changes in
policy. This notification should make it clear that
the university is willing to continue the program if
the policy that discriminates against homosexuals is
reversed.” It is this recommendation that Chancellor
O’Connor failed to endorse at the [University]
Senate Council meeting.

Instead of accepting the possibility of the ROTC’s
removal, Chancellor O’Connor opted to work with
the [American Association of Universities] as well as
write a letter to Secretary [of Defense Dick] Cheney,
asking him to change the policy  The letter clearly
expresses his personal and moral outrage over this
policy. The GPSA does not doubt [that] Chancellor

however, we urge that Chancellor O'Connor rethink
. his position  D
In addition, as president of the GPSA, I would I.
urge the ROTC program to take steps to disassociate .

itself from DoD policy discriminating on the basis of
sexual preference. In particular, I would urge the
directors of the program to lobby the DoD to
change the policy. As “teachers” within the military, .
they can provide the best evidence of the intellectual
and leadership loss the military is suffering through
this policy. I would also urge the student members

, of the ROTC to initiate programs and events designed

to demonstrate their own disapproval of the policy.
Finally, the university community should not accept
silence from the ROTC on this matter nor‘ any
arguments by the ROTC that imply they are not free

to speak out on this matter

The Pitt News

From the breathtaking explosiveness of
Steve Israel on the Pitt Stadium turf to the
anguish expressed on the face of Eric
Mobley in the ﬁnal seconds of the season-
ending NIT loss to Florida at the Field
House, the 1991-’92 Pitt sports season was
saturated with moments of promise and
moments of pain. Here, then, are a few
impressions on the year in sports at the
University of Pittsburgh. pl

Little was expected of a young and
unproven Panther football team as it broke
camp in‘ late August; Having endured the
off-season losses of stars Darnell

head coach Paul Hackett maintained a
cautious optimism heading into what many
felt was‘ a make-or-break, natio_nally

What followed that evening at
Mountaineer Field was a storyline that
would repeat itself throughout the first

performances from Israel, Sean Gilbert,

After losing three tough games

to Big East rival Seton Hall on
Sunday and Monday, the weary
Pitt baseball team travelled back
home yesterday to twice defeat
Crosstown rival Point Park.
' The Panthers opened their third
straight Big East, three-game series
on enemy turf. This third time,
against Seton Hall, was certainly
not the charm for Pitt; it dropped
the first game, 3-1.

“We didn’t hit at all,” Pitt head
coach Mark Jackson said about
his team’s miniscule four hits in
game one (14 hits overall for the
series). Pitt’s offensive woes were
not helped by the solid pitching
performance from Pirate pitcher

, Ted Klamm.

Allowing one run in the first

inning, Klamm shut down Pitt for
the remaining six innings. He got
all the offensive help he needed
in the bottom of the sixth, when
Seton Hall scored three runs to
take the lead. Klamm pitched a
complete game, striking out six
and giving up only one walk as
he led the Pirates to a close but
convincing 5-1 win.

Panther hurler Rob Hanawalt
also pitched a complete game,

' but he had to settle for a loss as

his teammates tried but failed to
break Klamm’s hitting spell.

Pitt hoped for the best in the
next two games against Seton
Hall, but this double-header
brought no luck and no wins. Pitt
lost both games, 11-5 and 11-1.
' In the first game of the double-
header, the Panthers awoke. They
scored two runs in the first two
innings. Center fielder Al Lardo
and second baseman Brad Reese
were both two-for—fou r, and each
drove in a run as well. But Pitt’s
4-0 lead did not last long.

pitcher. The Pirates tagged reliever
Jamie Goettler for five more runs
on their way to a cruising, 11-5
victory.

Leading Seton Hall in the hitting
department was first baseman
Mike Garcia and catcher Mike
Bagley. Garcia had two hits and
three RBIs, while Bagley also
collected two hits and one RBI.

The second game of the twin
bill was a game the Pitt hitters
would like to forget. Facing Pirate
pitcher Kevin Legault, the Panthers
were held to three hits against the
hottest hurler Seton Hall has.

Legault was almost
unstoppable. He pitched all nine
innings, allowing only one run
and striking out seven. Once again
it was Seton Ha1l’s pitching that
did Pitt in.

“Seton Hall has two good
starting pitchers [Klamm and
Legaultl,” Jackson said. “They are
two of the better pitchers in the
Big East conference.”

season, Pitt pitcher Bil1Junker [4-

2] was knocked around for five
runs and seven hits in his four
innings of pitching. Seton Hall
scored often in its 11-1 route and
had a host of hitters combine for
12 hits. Right fielder Clint Factor
had three hits, while Garcia
contributed two.

“We were really inconsistent,”
Jackson said about his team’s
play against Seton I-lall. “We didn’t
play good baseball.”

Ifplaying good baseball is what
the Panthers were seeking against
Seton Hall, they certainly found
it when they returned home
yesterday to play Point Park.

After tying the score at 1-1 in
the second and at 2-2 in the fifth,‘
Point Park finally took the lead in
the top of the sixth on an RBI
double by Mark Ansani. It added
another run in the seventh, when
Don Lowdermilk singled.

Down 4-2, Pitt was three outs
away from losing the opening
game of the double-header. But
after a single by first baseman
Jason Roth was followed by back-
to—back bunt singles, Pitt had the

bases loaded with no outs. After
Ralph McNelly walked to make
the score 4-3, center ﬁelder Al
Lardo drilled a game-winning
single up the middle to give the
Panthers a tense, 5-4 win.

Pitt got a strong performance
from both pitchers in game one.
Starter Denny Terzich pitched
four good innings and was
complemented nicely by three
solid innings of relief from Gregg
Mrochko.

“Denny lTerzichl is a senior
and a big part of our team,”
Jackson said. “It was real satisfying
to see him pitch well."

In the second game, Pitt fell
behind again. Down 5-0 after the
first inning, the Panthers had to
play catch-up in a hurry. After

scoring two runs in the bottom of A

the first, Pitt was on the
scoreboard.

Starting off the bottom of the
third, shortstop Josh Tyler
doubled to lead things off. After

a walk, catcher Jerry Berteotti

Injuries lead to losing skeins at end of tennis season

By Tom Schneider
Staff‘ Writer

The Pitt men’s and women’s
tennis teams, plagued by injuries
all year, wrapped up their seasons
with four consecutive losses.

The men’s team, coming off
two convincing victories over 1UP
and St. Francis of Pa. with scores
of 8-1 and 9-0, respectively,
managed to win only five of its
last 35 matches while losing four
straight to Edinboro (8-1), Akron
University (6-3), Youngstown
State (8-1) and Georgetown (8-
O).

The women were shutout twice
in their final four series, losing to
WVU (6--0), Allegheny College
(9-0), Edinboro (S-4) and
Youngstown State (4-3).

Said men’s and women’s head
coach George Dieffenbach, “The
last few teams we faced were

that everyone gave 100 percent,

and I’m very proud of their
performance throughout the
season.” The men finished the
season with 12 wins and 11 losses,
and the women closed out with
an 11-11 record.

Despite the poor ﬁnish, Pitt’s
season was highlighted by the
record-setting campaigns of
seniors John Tegano and Larry
Garrard as well as the spectacular
performances of Lady Panthers
Julie LoPrinzi andJenniferJacobs.

Tegano tallied 11 singles wins
this year, giving him 54 over his
four-year Pitt career.

This makes him Pitt's all—time

leader in singles victories,
surpassing the old mark of 51
wins set by Greg Campbell, who
graduated from Pitt in 1987.

Larry Garrard posted a solid
singles record this year with 13
wins and 15 losses. He also added
5 wins in doubles competition to
close out his career with 95 all-
purpose victories (51 singles, 44
doubles) —another Panther
record._ He, too, passed up Greg
Campbell for top honors on that
list. _

The Lady Panthers were once
again led by junior LoPrinzi, who
continued to establish her

dominance on the court
throughout the 1991‘-’92
campaign.

LoP rinzi compiled an incredible
singles record of 17-5 and a
doubles record of 11-8. Jacobs
also had a spectacular season,
finishing with an all—purpose
record of 15 wins and 9 losses
(10-4 singles; 5-S doubIes).Jacobs
will be returning to Pitt next year
as a fifth—year senior.

The men’s team will be losing
three vital parts ofits attack when
seniors John Tegano, Larry
Garrard and Joel Orth graduate
this year along with Kayran

for next fall, and Alex Cobbald
returns as a ﬁfth-year senior.

They will joinJa mes Chronister,
Effrum Garnett, Kevin

who will be returning from this
year’s team.

The women’s team will lose

THE PITI‘ NEWS, Wednesday, April 15, 1992

The regular season for the
Penguins is winding down with
only two games left. I hope they
lose them both.

You see, if the Pens lose both
games, they’ll definitely ﬁnish
fourth rather than third in the
Patrick Division. What’s my point?
Well, if the Pens ﬁnish fourth,
they’ll play the Rangers in the
first round ofthe playoffs; if they
finish third, they’ll play the
Capitals. The Penguins stand a

J much better chance against the

Rangers, who are the NHL’s best

team, than the Capitals. Here’s_

why:

The Penguins have been
dominated by Washington this
season. In six games, they have
compiled a record of 1-5 while
scoring only 17 goals and being
shut out once. In contrast, they
have given up 34, including eight
in a blowout earlier this season at
the Civic Arena.

There are many reason why
the Capitals are the tougher team
to beat. The main reason is their
defense.

Washington has one of the best
(if not the best) all-around
defenses in the game. Its blue

line is manned by the likes of

Kevin I-Iatcher, Al Iafrate, Calle
Johansson, ‘Sylvain Cote and Rod
Langway.

Hatcher has been a consistent,
all-around defenseman for the
Caps with his scoring and
defensive play. Iafrate is one of
the NHL’s fastest skaters, and he
possesses one of the hardest shots
i-nthe game. Johansson is one of
the most underrated offensive

CCITADCS.

defensemen in the league, and
Cote is having his best offensive
year. Add to that the solid play of
the veteran Langway, a former
Norris Trophy winner for
defensive excellence.

Secondly, the defense and
goaltending of Don Beaupre has
held the big guns of the Pens in
check.

Here’s some scoring stats for
the six games played: The NHL’s
leading scorer, Mario Lemieux,
has scored only one goal and six
assists; Kevin Stevens has totals
of one and four; JaromirJagr, two
and three; and Joey Mullen has
managed just one assist in his six
games against the Caps.

The only Penguin to play
consistent offense against
Washington is defenseman Larry
Murphy (a former Capital). He
has managed four goals and two
assists. A

The next reason the Caps will
beat the Penguins is because of
the clutch—and—grab tactics of their
forwards, especially Mike Ridley.
The Pens, as you know, hate
playing against teams that use
this style.

Jim Clark

The Penguins have played
much better against the Rangers
even though they have managed
a record of 2-4.

In thosesix games, Pittsburgh
has scored 24 goals and given up
25. Keep in mind, too, that the
Penguins’ record could easily be
3-3 against the Rangers if the
puck didn’t supposedly “go
through” the net at Madison
Square Garden earlier this season
(in one of the biggest blunders of
instant-replay history, including
football).

The Ranger defense, in contrast
to Washington’s, has only two
big guns. '

Brian Leetch, the ‘probable.

Norris Trophy winner, is the
Rangers’ big—scoring defenseman,
and James Patrick is a capable
offensive defenseman. The
Rangers dg have some hard-
hitting defensemen in Jeff

acquired Jay Wells. Those
defensive defensemen, however,
aren’t much (if any) better the
Penguins’ defensive stalwarts: the
Samuelssons (Ulf and Kjell),
Gordie Roberts, Paul Stanton,
GrantJennings, Jim Paek andJeff
Chychrun.

The top scorers ofthe Penguins
have done their job against the
Rangers not against Washington.-
In the six games to date Lemieux
has amassed goal and assist totals
of four and six; Stevens, three
and seven; Mullen, three and
five; Jagr, four and two; and
Murphy, one and three. Also, the
Pens seem to have John
Vanbiesbrouck’s number because
they’ll usually manage to put some
pucks in the net against him.

Another reason why the
Rangers will be the easier
opponent is because they have a
long history of choking. With the
exception of Mark Messier, the
other big guns of the Rangers
never perform when the
pressure’s on.If previous years

LALAAALAAAAAAAAAAAALAAAALAAAAAALAAAAAAAAALAALA

give any indication, don’t count’ 

on much scoring from Mike
Gaitner, Darren T urcotte andJohn
Ogrodnick.

The ﬁnal reason the Penguins
will do better against the Rangers
is because the Rangers are
overconfident. They’re already
saying how they’d much rather
face the Pens then New Jersey. 0

So here’s my predictions. If the
Pens ﬁnish fourth and play the
Rangers, the Penguins will take
the series in either six or seven
games. If they manage to come in
third and face the Caps, they’ll go
down in, five. '

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, April 15, 1992

 

Continued from page 12
through the course of the year
and broke into the national Top
25 coaches’ poll by year’s end.

Led by upperclassmen leaders
Don Boyd, Eric Mattson and Joe
Kozlina, the Panther waders were
men and boys compared to the
rest of the field at the Big East

I ‘ Championships, outscoring

bridesmaid Villanova by a
whopping 277.5 points to capture
their 10th straight league
championship. AlthoughJay Craft
of Syracuse nabbed_the honor of
Swimmer of the Meet, the “real”
man of the weekend was first-
year athlete Matt Brady, who won
three events and warmed the
cockles of Panther faithful with
his cocksure demeanor and
winning smile.

The post—meet celebration
produced two memorable
moments. First, there was Julian
Krug’s annual fully clothed flop

from the 10—meter platform: a

Panther tradition following any
league title.
And secondly, there was a Kodak

‘moment on top of the winner’s

platform, when the entire Pitt
team gathered and embraced —
symbolic of the kind of team
effort necessary to dominate any
conference year in, year out.

As for the women’s team and

head coach David Belowich, guts
and determination weren’t
enough to compensate for a
plethora of injuries, departures
and added competition from
league foes Villanova and
newcomer Miami of Florida. Led
by Lisa Flood, Villanova ended
the Panther reign at the top of the
Big East mountain at nine straight,
besting Miami, 682-640, ‘with Pitt
a distant third at 587 points.

Despite what on the surface
looks like a disappointing year,
there may never be a varsity team
at Pitt that held together through
adversity a'nd defeat so gallantly
as the Panther women.

The diving trio of Donna Flatch,
Kara Sixbury and Anne Marie
Rose performed consistently all

. year, while senior captains Laura-

Lee Sullivan and Janine-— Atiyeh
nurtured a talented core of first-
year swimmers —— including
Christy Knobloch, Laura Zdyb
and Vicky Geubtner— into major
contributors by year’s end.
Amid the icy, gray days of
January and February, the Panther
wrestling team glowed with
optimism. Ready to vindicate itself
from a poor ’91 dual-meetseason,
Pitt grappled with nine opponents
ranked among the nation’s top
25, and despite that brutal
schedule, flourished. Led by

returning All-Americans Scott
Hovan (158) and Perry Miller
(Heavyweight), the Panthers’ 11-
6 dual—meet record kept them a
mainstay in the Top 25 all season.
Hovan and Miller had plenty of
help from junior Sean Gibbs (167),
sophomore JeffKloiber (190) and
juniors Steve Budman (142) and
Bobby Simpson (118).
Highlights were numerous,

including an early season upset.

of fifth-ranked Ohio State and a
tough road win at West Virginia.
But the excitement of these road
conquests paled in comparison
to two EWL battles at Fitzgerald.

Against Lock Haven, Pitt trailed"

20-9 until Kloiber and Miller
resurrected the Panthers with two
pins, en route to a dramatic 21-20
victory.

The Panthers lifted Miller on
their shoulders in a memorable
post—match scene. Two weeks
later, Pitt knocked off eighth-
ranked Clarion, 22-19, for its
biggest win of the season. Again
it was Kloiber’s major decision
and Miller’s pin that lifted Pitt
over the Golden Eagles in front of
a raucous crowd in an electrically
charged Field House.

Pitt grabbed second place,
outright, in a league that featured
six ranked teams. Three Panthers

marched into the EWL
Tournament finals, but all came
away with second place..The
most painful bout may have been
Gibbs’ overtime loss to'Penn
State’s Dave Hart, a bout decided
by a referee’s questionable
stalling call.

However I-lovan, Miller, Gibbs
and Kloiber moved on to
Oklahoma City for the NCAA
Tournament, in which Pitt
finished 19th. Despite the
graduation of his two warhorses,
head coach Rande Stottlemyer
will return an experienced team,
bolstered by prospects like J.J.
Fasnacht, Joe Plouse, John Richey
and Pat Wiltanger.

While one Panther squad that
called Fitzgerald Field House
home improved as the season
grew, another tenant of the facility
withered as the Pittsburgh winter
gave way to spring. Paul Evans’
spirited young basketball team
began in the fall with expectations
to ﬂounder through the Big East
season, but after a raucous start

with wins at Kentucky and Texas '

there grewa sense of anticipation

throughout Oakland.

Led by an aggressive, man—to—
man defense and the steady hand
of Sean Miller, Pitt bolted to an
11-4 start and actually inhabited

the Top 25 for a brief period.
Despite a four-game losing skid,
the Field House Fanatics
continued to rock Fitzgerald. With
every E. Mobley monster mash,
Chris McNeal rebound and Miller
nolook pass, the Fanatics charged
up the atmosphere in “Cameron
Crazy-like” fashion, rendering
verbal assaults like, “Blue Seats
Suck!” “Big, Tall White Guy!” and
“No Murdock, No Screen, No
Chance!” to anyone willing to
listen.

Adding to the atmosphere at
the House was the inspired antics
of “Panther Paul,” a longtime

. season—ticket holder and jolly,

old hoops fan who effortlessly
led the half-caring, mostly-
apathetic crowd in the Hey Song
during time outs.

But the early enthusiasm would
soon deteriorate into the annual
Paul Evans-bashing onslaught as
Pitt dropped six of its nine games
down the stretch-. The
consequence of that horrid run
was the infamous Thursday night
disaster at Madison Square
Garden. r

Pitt faced one of the least-
feared squads in the nation,
Miami, and leftMSG a beaten and
embarrassed team. Redemption
came at (where else?) State
College. The Panthers matched
up with Penn State in a game they
weren’t supposed to care about.
But the guts they showed that
night amounted to a 67-65 win.

The ’91—_’92 year won’t go down
as one of the greatest in Panther
sports history, but Pitt did produce
two conference champions,
several All-Americans and
memories. For the athletes who

' strived to be the best, thatwill last
forever. *
