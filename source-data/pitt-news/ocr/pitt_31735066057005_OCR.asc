Pittsburgh citizens to

Take Back the Night

By Kelly B. Casey
Photography Editor

Armed with flashlights, citi-
zens of Pittsburgh will be
marching through Downtown
Friday night, lighting a crime-
free path.

“It is unrealistic to think that
‘Take Back the Night’ will be a
panacea for all the terrible
things that go on in the work-
place and on the streets,” Pitt
student Shira Hassan said. “But
it is a chance to. know you’re
not alone, and safe for one

night.”
The event, co-sponsored by
Pitt’s Campus Women’s

Organization and Pittsburgh
Action Against Rape (PAAR),
will begin with a rally at 7:15
pm. outside the Federal
Building on Liberty Avenue.

A The group will then take to
the streets, marching up Grant
Street and Liberty Avenue,

continuing up Seventh
Avenue.
The march will end in

Market Square, where speak-
ers_ will share their experiences
of abuse with hundreds of
strangers. Entertainment will
be provided by the local femi-
nist band Cross Current. Stella
Gresham from the World Life
Foundation will give a report
on the rape camps in war—torn
former Yugoslavia.

For the past two months,
CWO members Shira Hassan
and Ann Lewis, as well other
members, have been actively
coordinating the events with
employees of PAAR.

“My headlhas been spin-
ning,” said Hassan, an English
literature major with a concen-
tration in women’s studies. “I
probably should have blown
off all my classes.”

CWO and PAAR decided to

work in conjunction after dis-
covering a mutual interest in
sponsoring the event.

“It’s fabulous to actually
establish a positive relation-
ship with a student organiza-
tion,” said PAAR Educational
Training Specialist Barbara

Weiner, noting that PAAR had-

lost touch with Pitt’s campus
after moving from campus to
the South Side.

“[CWO membersl have
added a solid working
momentum,” she added.

Weiner, who coordinated
the last “Take Back the Night,”
gave her definition of the
event. a

“It is a group of people com-
ing together and making an
anti-violent statement,”-slie
said.

Weiner expressed disap-
pointment that college stu-
dents could not be found to
speak at the event.

Date and acquaintance rape
is a common occurrence on
college campuses, she said,
citing a 1988 research project.
The project, conducted by
Kent State psychology profes-
sor, Mary P. Koss, found that
one in four women are sexual-
ly assaulted on college cam-
puses.

Three years ago nearly 1,000
people participated in the
PAAR-sponsored “Take Back
the Night.” According to
\Y/einer,r the event, which
began in California by a stu-
dent activist in the ‘70s, has
grown into an international
event.

Seventh-year student Lewis
said the event is important
because it is a way for people
to recognize that they live in a
society where violence against
women is prevalent.

Health risks and dust are
concerns for Hollow parkers

By John Temple
Asst News Editor

Commuters who park in Panther Hollow may want to look
for another spot for the next three months.

Dust fallout from the Schenley Bridge construction project
may damage cars parked below in Panther Hollow, accord-
ing to Pitt’s Parking Director Jan Thomas.

The bridge, which has been closed to motor vehicles since
November, links the Pitt campus with Flagstaff Hill. For the
next few months, sandblasting will cause dust to drift down
to the Hollow, possibly damaging paint finish on cars.

“I have been informed that hosing the vehicle shortly after
dust accumulation will help prevent damage to the paint,”

Thomas said.

The department issued a permit to the contractors
mandating air pollution control measures. Health questions
should be directed to the department’s Bureau of Medical

Services.

By Pete Kapustynski

_ Asst News Editor

Lynn Margulis, one of the

_ country’s leading biological

scientists, will speak at Pitt
on the biological “Origin of
Sex.”

Her talk will be held at
Lecture Hall 9 in Clapp Hall
on Wednesday, March 31 at
8:15 pm.

Margulis is currently a
member of the National
Academy of Sciences and a
Distinguished University
Professor of biology at the
University of
Massachusetts.

Margulis is also continu-
ing research on theories
she developed nearly 30
years ago —— theories
regarding the origins of
parts of cells and the evolu-
tion of life,

Margulis is a leading
American proponent of the
“Gaia Theory,” or “Gaia
Hypothesis,” of life on
Earth (in Greek mythology,
Gaia was the goddess of
Earth).

The Gaia Hypothesis was
proposed in the 197()s by
British scientist James
Lovelock.

The hypothesis proposes

that life on Earth is main-.
’ tained by a complex bal-

ance of interlocking, self-
regulating ecosystems —
basically, that Earth is a sin-
gle, giant organism.
Margulis’ lecture is being
co-sponsored by Pitt’s
Honors College, the depart-
ment of biological sciences,
the department of the his-
tory of the philosophy of
science and the pymatun-
ing laboratory of ecology.

Staff Writer

Dr. Wesley Posvar gazes at
the memorabilia that adorn
the bookcase in his 12th-
floor Cathedral of Learning
office.

He isn’t looking at the
football presented to him
after the Panthers won the
national championship at the
Sugar Bowl. He isn’t looking
at the numerous plaques and
medals meticulously laid
out. And he isn’t staring at
the manuscript of “The
President’s March,” written
for Posvar by Pitt’s director
of bands. -

The object holding
Posvar’s attention at the
moment is a framed copy of
The Pitt News, dated April 1,
1977. On the front page is a
picture of a gargantuan
Posvar on the top of the
Cathedral of Learning,
clutching a miniature King
Kong. Beside the picture ‘is
the caption “Pos Nabs Ape.”

Posvar, now a professor of
international politics, says
he misses his former, more
grandiose duties, but he is
still very busy at the univer-
sity.

Especially because he has
not taught a class in over 40
years.

“I don’t have much spare
time,” Posvar chuckles.

Posvar teaches the gradu-
ate seminar for international
politics. He is teaching the
seminar for the first time,
which means he has a lot of
work to do.

“It’s a bold undertaking,”
Posvar explains. “I’ve been
out of active teaching in my
field for about 40 years. I’m
plowing new ground all the
time.”

Believe it or not, teaching

' is what the former Pitt leader

always wanted to do. He
likes it because it allows him
time to pursue his own inter-
ests.

“As president, I was often
in situations that were
demanding]: he said. “That’s
fun too, but it's strenuous.”

Posvar’s departure from
Pitt was at least as strenuous
as his tenure. He left two
years ago amid controversy
over his large retirement
package.

Posvar says he is not bitter
about the media’s treatment
of him when details of his
retirement package and
presidential spending were
plastered over the front
pages of the local newspa-
pers. But he is not happy
about it either. _ I

“The information about me
was to a great extent false
and misrepresented,” Posvar
says. “Even media people

‘have told me that the stories

From president to professor, Po

were highly exaggerated.
Ninety percent of my retire-
ment funds were my own
savings and investments
from over a quarter of a cen-
tury.”

These days, the most stress_
Posvar encounters is getting
his students to open up in
class. He said he has a good
rapport with his students
and enjoys the class.

“I love to teach,” Posvar
says.

Aside from teaching,
Posvar is a trustee of both
the U.S. Space Foundation
and the Carnegie
Endowment for International
Peace, in which he is on a
special commission named
“Changing Our Ways,” which
gives advice to President Bill
Clinton.

For 12 years Posvar was
the founding chair of the
Federal Emergency
Management Advisory Board
and also founding chair of
the National Advisory
Council on Environmental
Policy and Technology. In
short, Posvar is the Bo
Jackson of the government
and academic circles.

In his spare time, Posvar
enjoys sports, both as a par-
ticipant and a viewer, espe-
cially with football season
around the corner and the
return of head coach Johnny
Majors. Posvar’s love of Pitt

be good, and he’s an excel-

“I have many friends who

Meanwhile, Posvar leans
back in his chair and
thinks about what has
happened during his tenure
as president of Pitt. He says
the best thing he did was
to take a university on
the edge of fiscal collapse
and nurture it into an
excellent institution possess-
ing a distinguished
reputation.

And Posvar thinks his suc-
cessor J. Dennis O'Connor
will do a fine job and contin-
ue the tradition that Posvar
created.

“I am confident that he
will progress even further,”
Posvar says. ‘fOnward and
upward.”

Law professor has
concrete ties to Pitt

By Victor Wallace
For The Pitt News

The legacy some peoplevleave behind is nothing more than
money and personal belongings.

Professor Edward Sell’s legacy is the bricks and mortar of
the University of Pittsburgh School of Law.

In his 44-year tenure at Pitt, Sell has served as professor,
associate dean, dean and distinguished service professor of
law.

His accomplishments include the construction of the law
building and expanding enrollment in the law school.

Current law school Dean Mark Nordenberg joked about the
77-year-old Sell.

“Ed likes to kid me by reminding me he joined the faculty a
year before I was born,” Nordenberg said.

Sell attended college at Washington & Jefferson in
Pennsylvania. His law school years were spent at Yale
University.

Fresh out of law school, Sell joined Pitt’s law faculty in the
summer of 1947.

After a short stint as a U.S. Steel attorney, Sell returned to
the law school because, he explained, his first love in law
was to teach it.

In 1966 he was named the dean of the law school. It was at
that time that a transition came to the school.

Sell said he attributes the boost in law school enrollment
during his term to a romanticizing of the profession of law
and the women's rights movement. Women became encour-
aged to go out and enter into a male—dominated world, he
said. .

These factors helped Sell make what he considers his great-
est accomplishment — creating the foundation for the
school’s current success.

“When I took over there were 130 students and eight faculty
members,” he said. “When I left [as dean] the school had 700
students and 30 faculty members.”

His biggest accomplishment is seen by Pitt students daily
on the corner of Forbes Avenue and Bouquet Street. He is
considered by many as “the builder” of Pitt’s law building.

The permanent home of the law school was dedicated in
1976. The building was important to Sell because, he said, it
showed the university’s commitment in taking the law school
to a higher level.

Music may be SliVinska's forte,
but she is going to study law

By Victor Wallace
For Tbe Pitt News

Diana Slivinska has three degrees from
Duquesne University —— in music education,

piano and voice.

She has studied lieder (music) in Germany
and opera at the Ezio Pinza Council for
American Singers of Opera.

Now she is in her second year at Pitt Law
School. A dramatic change in lifestyle to say
the least.

“I wasn’t making enough money as a musi-
cian to support myself in the style which I
would like to become accustomed,” she said.

She added that the next best thing to per-
forming on stage is performing in a courtroom.

Though law school keeps her busy, she is
also involved in a variety of activities.

She is an associate editor of the journal of
Law and Commerce. She plays organ and
teaches a choir on weekends. Slivinska is also
vice president and membership chair of the
Pittsburgh Savoyards.

The Savoyards is a non—profit theater group

that performs the works of Gilbert and
Sullivan. Slivinska currently plays the female
lead in the comedy opera The Mtleado.

One might think that she is spreading herself
thin, but Michael Greenstein of the Savoyards
disagrees.

“Diana is one of those people who needs to
be doing a million things,” Greenstein said.
“She has kept them going with ease.”

Slivinska remains close to her musical edu-
cation background. She taught at the Center
for the Musically Talented and also substituted
at the All Saints Elementary School in Etna.

“I don’t like teaching music, I like doing
music,” Slivinska said. According to her, a
music teacher is the low man on the totem
pole and the first one whose funds will get cut.

She decided to begin her trek at law school
here at Pitt.

She joined the _/ourrzal of l.au‘ and
Conmzerce. Her 5-4—page, 194—footnotc scholar-

’ ly article will be published in the spring issue.

Slivinska said. she feels that getting
ublished is one of her reatest accom )lish—
l
ments.

Gottfried sees need for strong
technology base in America

By Samuel A. Gresock
For The Pitt News

The walls of his tiny office are
adorned with photographs of
Ohiopyle and the old J&L steel
mill, which he took himself. He
plays drums in a swing band
and says he is “on a mission.”

He’s Dr. Byron Gottfried, as

professor in Pitt’s department of
industrial engineering.

Although he works approxi-
mately 50 hours each week, he
said that time is well-spent.

“When I worked in industry, I
noticed it was very compart-
mentalized,” Gottfried said. “I
was looking for freedom, for the
opportunity to interact with
people in a non-sales situation.
And that’s why I went into edu-
cation.”

Gottfried, who currently
serves as academic head of the
first-year engineering program,
says his students aren’t the only
people who learn in his classes.

“You can learn a lot by teach-
ing  you feel that you have
something to pass on tosorne-
one else,” he said.

Gottfried, born in 1934 in
Detroit, received his bachelor’s
degree in chemical engineering
from Purdue University and his
master’s from the University of
Michigan. He then went on to
work for Westinghouse in
Pittsburgh.

Gottfried later moved to
Cleveland, where he earned his
doctorate degree from Case
Western’ Reserve and worked
for NASA before returning to
Pittsburgh in the mid-’60s.

“I went into the profession of
engineering because I liked sci-
ence and math  I was thinking
of going into music, but people

told me [music] wasn’t that good.

Dr. Byron Gottfried is "on a mission"

of a business,” he said.

“During the Korean War,
there was an acute shortage. of
engineers,” he added. “So, I
went into engineering without
much of an idea what I was get-
ting into, like most engineering
students.” V

Gottfried’s first job as a, pro-
fessor came at Carnegie Mellon
University, where he taught
mechanical engineering. After
working at Gulfs research lab
for several years, he came to the
University of Pittsburgh in 1970.

Was the change in scenery a
good one?

“On the one hand, Pitt is a
quality urban university that
provides diversity to a large
variety of students,” he said. “I
think students here can learn
more than at more prestigious
universities.”

“On the other hand, I don’t

Sell stepped down as
Dean in 1977 to
become a teacher once
again. During his years
he has taught about
4,000 students.

Dennis Harrington, a
local lawyer, was one
of Sell’s students in
1949. At that time many
of Sell’s students were
two or three years older
than him.

“Teachers rank next
to clergy. Ed’s contribu-
tion is in teaching,”
Harrington said. .

Sell volunteers and
serves on several com-
mittees and boards,
including St. Clair
Hospital, Little Lake
Theater and the
Allegheny County Bar
Association.

Rather than take a
break, Sell said his
plans are to continue
writing and publishing.

“I’ve worked all my
life and don’t want to

Lewis said she was most

impressed by the courage
of one man who shared
with 1,000 strangers his expe-

Canadian care

Nada is a woman from Saudi Arabia. Her story is one where 
religious teachings from the Koran have come into conflict with the Western
worid’s concept of human rights.

‘ Her story came to the attention of the U.N. high commissioner for ‘

refugees after she was beaten and stoned for trying to drive a car (illegl for
Saudi Arabian women) and appearing in public without a veil.

Another woman, mined Zahra, is the wife of an Iranian revolutionary
guard. She claims that her husband repeatedly beats and rapes her. Upon
application, both women were rejected refugee status to Canada (although
Nada had the decision later reversed by the Canadian minister of imrnigra-
tion). Fleeing oppression, neither woman had anywhere to turn — not
home, not abroad. The same is true for many women worldwide.

Now that has changed According to The Economist our neighbors to the
north have established a set of guidelines that will make it easier for women
who fear violence to claim refugee status. The regulations, it should be
noted, are there not so much to stop the dornmtic violence against women
but to give the women protection because the state does nothing to stop the
brutal exploitation.

The guidelines have been well received in general, although they have
been criticized for going too far or not far enough. Radical women’s groups
have expressed an interest to get these rules mandated in law. Those on the
other side of the issue are wonied about an inﬂux of immigrants showing
up on Canada’s doorstep with nothing more than a broken fingernail.

Mandating these regulations, while not a bad idea, is not the answer for
Canada. Such an economically small country, it cannot be» expected to solve

' the problems of women around the world. However, Canada has taken an

important step, and many other nations should follow its lead

To answer the critics who say that an inﬂux of reﬁigees will be the result,
this is simply not true. Most of these women come from cultures quite diﬂ’er-
ent from our own. Leaving a spouse and family is hard enough, let alone an
entirely different country and culture. C

NAFTA necessary

Unions, politicians, employees, employers and industrial leaders are
gearing up for a ﬁght over The North Atlantic Free Trade Agreement. The
tra1ty's intentions are to reduce barriers to trade between Mexico, Canada
and the United States and increase the overall living standard of the citizens
of these ‘nations.

The NAFTA agreement has met with criticism from several groups. Anti-

NAFTAns argue that the beneﬁts of the treaty will be oliset by the costs to.

the environment and American jobs. Union leaders and House Majority
Leader Richard “The Mouth” Gephardt have said that big business will
move down South to take advantage of the low Mexican wages and lax
environmental laws. '

Evidence about companies moving out of the United States to take
advantage of lower wages, however, is minimal at best. Japanese and
European investment have ﬂowed into the United States — not Sri Lanka
and Mexico. The reason is simple. American workers are the most produc-
tive in the world. High wages are not maintained in the face of protection-
ism, they are maintained because of efficiency and competition.

In regard to environmental concerns, NAFTA is extremely responsible. It
welcomes environmental groups into the decision—making process and
allows them to see any information they need to make their case.
Moreover‘, this treaty has resulted in an agreement between Mexico and the
United States to spend $700 million to clean up their border.

But even without this information, Mexico is pervaded by ineﬂicient, old»
polluting factories that degrade the environment. Increasing investment "

and transfening technology will do more to protect the environment than
any kind of regulation. After all, pollution, by its very definition, is waste,
and since waste results in higher costs and inefficiency (that is to say bad
business) for ﬁrms Mexico will be forced to clean up its act.

So for those special interest groups who are rejecting NAFTA on grounds '

of environmental degradation and lost jobs, you are not interested in either
of thcrse two things — you’re interested in saving your own hide.

Take responsibility for your actions

merica. For centuries, its
image has been that of
“the land of opportuni-
ty.” People come from every-
where hoping to get a piece of
the American dream. But that
image is fading under the
growing weight of social ills.
The rates of crime and drug
use are up. Teenage pregnan-
cy and poverty are up. And
our educational system is on
the decline. The dream is
becoming a nightmare. Why?
Some have blamed our
problems on a growing lack of
family values. The argument
goes something like this:
Families are no longer staying
together and teaching “tradi-
tional” moral values to their
children. Because these chil-
dren don’t grow up with prop-
er values, they are more likely
to get involved with drugs‘ and
crime. They are more likely to

get pregnant or get someone

else pregnant at a young age.
They are more likely to drop
out of school or end up in
poverty. In general, they will
not be successful in life. In
addition, when they start fami-
lies of their own, they will not
be able to impart values on
their kids. The problem soon
multiplies to immense propor-
tions.

Sounds good, but the advo-
cates of “traditional” values
have overlooked two things. It
is not necessary to come from
an intact family in order to
have moral values. Nor does
coming from an intact family
guarantee that one will have
such values. Many individuals,
including myself, have come
from broken homes and still
managed to succeed. We have
a strong sense of values and
have not become entangled
with our nation’s social ills.
Alternatively, many people
come from intact homes and
still end up involved with
drugs or crime.

It is true that recent statistics
show a strong correlation

between the breakup of the
family and the breakdown of
society. Children who come
from broken homes are much
more likely to add to our soci-
ety’s problems than those who
come from intact families.
However, these statistics are.

, misleading. It is just as possi-

ble that the social problems

' themselves have led to the dis-

integration of the family.
Alternatively, both could be
symptoms of a much larger
cause.

The fact is, family values
have become the victim of the
same underlying problem
causing, many of our social ills,

Mike
Brittingham

a growing lack of responsibili-
ty in our society. The problem
of teenage pregnancy is a per-
fect example. Instead of wait-
ing for marriage to engage in
sexual activity, an astounding
number of young people are
having sex at increasingly
early ages. Most of these
young “adults” have little, if
any, idea of the ‘responsibility
they are taking on or the
implications involved in get-
ting (or getting someone else)
pregnant.

They are living in a dream
world where sex is the ulti-
mate way to fit in. But, all too
often that world is shattered
by harsh realities. And before
they know it, they are alone
and caring for a child, the first
in a new generation of irre-
sponsible kids ready to make
the same mistakes their par-
ents made -—— except perhaps a
little earlier. Or maybe they’ll
get an abortion and end up
right back where they started,
just as ignorant as before and
ready to start down the same
dark path again and again.

Who’s_ to blame for allowing
America’s future to throw it all

away for the sake of a “quick-
ie” in the back seat of a car
and a false image of being
“cool?” Partially it’s the fault of
the parents who failed in their
responsibility to teach their
children how to be responsi-
ble adults. Partially it’s the
fault of a system which pro-
motes abortion as the quick
and easy “choice” of getting
out of one’s problems. In the
end, however, it’s the fault of
the individual, and he or she
must pay the price.
Unfortunately, that price
can’t be restricted to them
alone. We all pay for it every
day as the problems caused by
irresponsibility eat away at our
society. It has crept into every
fabric of our daily lives, in our

government, our schools and ~

our businesses. The American
people scream for cuts in gov-
ernment spending and scream
again when the cuts are made
in their districts. Schools are
closed for lack of funds as
people become unwilling to
shoulder the “burden” of edu-
cation. And our work ethic
declines and our industrial
might wanes while our work-

ers clamor for higher wages

and shorter hours. _

What it all comes down to is
that everyone wants the bene-
fits of a free society, but no
one wants to be responsible
for the bill. But when no one
is willing to take responsibili-
ty, everyone pays the price.
And as we wait for someone
else to take the initiative, the
conditions in our society
become rapidly worse. Soon
the price may be too high for
anyone to pay. Someone has
to take the initiative to solve
these problems! Someone has
to take a stand and accept the
responsibility! Something must
be done! But don’t look at me.
It’s not my problem. I have my
own life to live. I

In addition to writing,
Gottfried has worked on
numerous research projects.
Several years ago he spent a
sabbatical leave working on a
project that used computer
graphics to assist people in data

the project became part of a

More recently, Gottfried has
been “trying to enlist’ some grad

on a study of the detailed oper-

Still, Gottfried’s top priority is

After coming back from a
seven-run deficit to take the
second game of a double-
header at Villanova this past
weekend, the Pitt baseball
team was in high spirits for
its first home game yesterday
against Geneva College at
Trees Field.

Pitt catcher Pat Walsh col-
‘lected three of the Panthers’
11 hits, and starting pitcher
Jason Rakers struck out 12
Geneva batters in nine
innings of work to lead the
Panthers to an 8-4 victory
over the Golden Tornadoes.
The Panthers improved their
season record to 14-2 with
the win.

A leaky Geneva defense
lent help to the Panther
cause as the Tornadoes com-
mitted a total of six errors,
three of which were commit-
ted by shortstop Sean Carrol.

Meanwhile, the Panther
defense was flawless in back-
ing up Rakers, who fought
off a few bumps and bruises
suffered in the early innings
to retire 13 of the last 15
Tornado batters and pick up
his third win of the season.

Despite his team coming
out on top at the end,
Panther head coach Mark
Jackson said he was disap-
pointed with the team’s stats
in other areas of the game.

“We had a few timely hits,
but I felt we probably
could’ve scored a lot more,”

bottled us up in the neutral
zone, but anyway you put it
down it’s a win and two
points.”

With the Patrick Division
race decided — Sunday’s
win solidified their hold on
the division -- there is very
little to get overly excited
about, especially against the
worst team in the league.

“There was not a lot of
emotion out there,” Penguin
captain Mario Lemieux said.
“Every time you’re playing a
teamlike Ottawa, you tend
to not get yourself up for the
game and that’s the way this
team has been playing the
last few weeks. We like to
play against good hockey
teams.”

The top three players in the
Geneva lineup didn’t help
matters for their squad, as
leadoff hitter Jeff Beltz, right
fielder Curt Frasier and Carrol
were a combined one for 12

times.

Most of the Tornadoes’
offense was provided by the
middle of the order, as first
baseman Steve Shaffer and
third baseman Greg Mitchell
drove in three of Geneva’s
four runs, with each man
going two for four with a
home run.

Pitt spread out its offensive
production fairly evenly with
eight different Panthers scor-
ing runs. Individual standouts
included Walsh, who had an

Pitt football adopts quicker tempo at spring practice

Matt Serlin/The Pitt News
Johnny Majors has brought a faster tempo and a new atti-
tude to Pitt's spring football practices.

By Cory Walborn
Senior Staff Writer

A roar resounds off the
empty seats of Pitt Stadium.
Another practice repetition
concludes and the players
holler. But their voices end
as soon as they begin, on to
another rep. No players walk
—-— all run. If someone makes
a mistake,
they repeat
the drill
until they
get it right.
And every-
thing is
quick. So
quick, it is easy to tell Pitt’s
1993 spring practice is in full
swing with a new attitude
and newfound hustle. Call it
a “Major” twist.

As Johnny Majors takes the
reigns at Pitt, spring practice
is the first target he is aiming
to conquer. Majors and his
new coaching staff have
made some significant
changes.

“Coach Majors bases every-
thing on technique, funda-
mentals and tempo. Lots and
lots of reps,” defensive coor-
dinator Chuck Driesbach
said. “We do no walking
around. We only rest in the
huddle and go hard ‘til the
whistle blows.

 

“The effort of the player
wins games, and we’ll
always coach effort,”
Driesbach said.

The ‘atmosphere surround-
ing the Panthers’ practice is
completely different. The
players have the‘ effort and
are eager. Majors’ system is
the key.

“ [Majors] is an inspira-
tional type of person,” tail-
back Curtis Martin said. “He
makes people work harder
than they are used to.”

Martin stressed the change
of attitude acquired by the
team and said it is Pitt’s
biggest strength right now.

“There’s a lot more intensi-
ty,” Martin said. “We have a
positive attitude, everything
is so crisp in practice.

“We are all one heartbeat,”
Martin said of Pitt’s cohe-
siveness. “We are all on the
same page. We are all one
individual.”

Getting all the players on
the same level is a goal of
the Panthers’ new coaching
staff.

“The players are learning
tempo right now,” running
back coach Charlie Coe said.
“By tempo, 1 mean in and
out of reps quick. Running
to and fro.”

This quick style has creat-
ed more discipline, a disci-

pline lacking last year.

“A lot of people could goof
around last year,” tailback
Vince Williams said. “There’s
more discipline this year. If
you mess up, you have to do
it over again. You have to be
precise.”

Williams said that doing 20
to 30 push-ups was an effec-
tive means of punishment
for a mistake. Williams also
said that this type of disci-
pline creates a team‘and not
individuals.

“The coaches treat every-
body the same,” Williams
said. “Nobody’s a star.”

With the team concept
established from the begin-
ning of practice, Majors and
his staff can now see what it
has to work with and what
expectations to make.

Offensive line coach Jack
Henry said he advocates
Majors’ disciplined practices.

“Johnny has a saying, ‘If
you tell people what you
expect, then expect them to
do it,’ it is like saying ‘Say
what you mean and mean

‘what you say,”’ Henry said.

Expectations are high
when dealing with Majors.
He has won everywhere he
has been, Henry said.

“If these expectations are
met, it makes the games

Brown, forgenson cap
oﬁ” gymnastics careers

By Todd S. Rimer
Staff Writer

They were the worst of
friends, they were the best 0
friends. «

“We went from two people
who hated each other, were
miserable around each other
and did not want to speak to
each other to becoming best
friends to one another,” senior
Pitt gymnast Karen Jorgensen
said about her relationship
with teammate Kristin Brown.

“We disliked each other so
much that we would just as
soon run the other over with a
PAT bus,” Brown said.

When their first year began,
they were constantly on the
outs with one another. Plus,
Jorgensen said she was having
personal problems and was
contemplating the possibility
of ending her college career in
gymnastics before it even start-
ed. But she regrouped and
came back to the gym “a
whole new Karen,” according
to Brown.

Everything turned around for
the two of them as friends and
as gymnasts prior to the start
of their first meet on the colle—
giate level against Penn State

University. They were sitting
next to each other on the
bench, each wishing they were
somewhere else, far away from
the other. Then, head coach
Deb Yohman came up to them
and informed them of the
good news that they would be
competing as the all-arounders
for the team.

“We each looked at the other
and thought, ‘Wow! We are
only freshmen and we are the
only gymnasts competing as all
arounders,”’ Jorgensen said.
“We proved that we were top
notch and deserved to be com-
peting on the collegiate level.
It was a complete bonding
experience.”

As with most successful
gymnasts, both began their
careers at an early age.
Jorgensen began at age five
and Brown at age eight. For
both, hyperactiveness was the
motivation behind their par-
ents deciding to involve them
in‘ gymnastics.

“I was a hyperactive child
who was bouncing off the
walls all the time,” Jorgensen
said. “I was driving my mother
crazy. Then one day I saw an
exhibition at a local club and I

The Pitt men’s track team
made a smooth transition
from indoor to outdoor
track this past weekend
with three Eastern
Championship (IC4As)
qualifiers and a strong
showing from the
shuttle/hurdle relay team as
the team competed in its
first outdoor track meet of
the season at the Alabama
Relays.

“We had some really good
opening performances,”
head coach John Vasvary
said.

Senior Brian Whitley ran a
strong 400 meter to come in
eighth with a time of 48.08
seconds, and, more impor-

tantly,
IC4As.

Sophomore Wes
Alexander is headed for
IC4As in two events.
Alexander qualified with a
time of 53.38 seconds in the
400-meter intermediate hur-
dles, which was good
enough for eighth place and
also clinched a spot in the
110 high hurdles with a
time of 14.67 seconds.

Right behind Alexander in
the 110-meter high hurdles
was first-year hurdler Jay
Murphy, who finished with
a time of 14.73 seconds,
which also gave him an
invitation to the IC4As.
Murphy is the Big East
Champion in the 55 hurdles.

Whitley, Alexander and
Murphy teamed up with

John Dixon who is coming
off a sprained ankle that
caused him to miss the Big

place second in the shuttle
hurdle relay with a time of

The Panthers did not take
the entire team to this meet.
The meet featured East
Coast schools as well as
teams from the
Southeastern Conference
(SEC).

The team will split up
again this coming weekend
as the sprinters and hur-
dlers will travel to the
Gatorade Meet at the
University of Miami, and the
distance runners and field
event competitors will com-
pete at the Colonial Relays
at William and Mary.

“Obviously this is a differ-

head coach Rick Bowness
said. “[The Penguins] are
bigger and faster, but we
competed with them  until
the bitter end.”

Pens’ defenseman Larry
Murphy returned from injury
to notch a pair of goals and
the number—one star of the
game.

More importantly, he
scored his 20th goal of the
season and the 200th of his
career. j

“I felt good this morning
and knew that when I came

said.

After receiving a standing
ovation for his 200th career

Seeing what’s there

A person who rejects the law of gravity despite
much evidence is not a person who is in touch with
reality. As long as he keeps pretty much to himself,

.. he may meet with little resistance to his point of view.

He probably has a developed explanation for the way
things are and why his feet are glued to the ground,

but once such a person begins to relate to others, his .

view may be met as peculiar, eccentric, or potentially

dangerous. Should he become an airplane pilot, his

0 views may properly disqualify him from any flying. .
' No matter how nice a man he may be, he does not see
_, what is there and before I climb aboard a 747, I want V
to know that the pilot is at least sane.

Seeing what is there is the same as saying that

 one perceives reality accurately. One could say that

to perceive reality is a minimum requirement for

getting along in the world. Perceptions of reality .

affect people. ‘For anyone to eliminate or ignore a

fundamental element of reality is not only to ‘

endanger themselves, but others as well. It is

V important for us to see what is really there.

Christianity is a revelation of reality, piercing

through the fog of misconception to see what is really '

there. It is not a private religion, nor a pious excercise
for self-fulfillment. It claims to answer not only the
deepest questions of human life, but to be the
foundational truth of all that is, whether scientific or
otherwise. If it is true, if it answers and explains what
is going on around us, then to ignore Christ is to miss
what is central to all reality. It is to go through life

. missing what is really there.

seem not as challeng—
ing compared to prac-
tice,” Henry said.

Practice has been
challenging so far. The
coaches have been
enthusiastic and deter-
mined to make the
players believe in
themselves. Their
drenched sweatshirts
attest for that. ‘

Being coached with a
“-get—up—and—go” atti-
tude, the players are
already responding to
the coaches. Tom
Tumulty’s loud Vocals
support that.

“Extra effort,” Martin
said. “You can see it on
the field.”

But spring practice is
just under way. The
Panthers are still young
and raw and have a
long way to go.

“\X/e’re real young
right now, it’s so
early,” passing coach
Ken Karcher said.
“Right now we’re just
going to get a lot of
guys reps.”

Reps, reps and quick-
er reps is what is in
store for this spring
practice. Reps that will
create a new attitude, a
harder work ethic and,
more importantly, a
team.

“Everybody is going
to get a fair opportuni-
ty to show what they
can do,” Coe said.

And the players like
it.

“The best people will
play,” Williams said.
“That’s what it [foot-
ball] is all about.”

It isgalso about the
springtime roars that
fill an empty Pitt
Stadium, signifying a
lot more than just
noise.

The Panthers jumped out of the gate
in the bottom of the first. Lardo, who
was on third base after tripling over
center fielder Beltz’s head, caught
X»; Geneva pitcher Todd Anthony snooz-

\C“‘. ing and stole home with first baseman
‘V ‘ Jason Roth in the batter’s box to give
‘\ Pitt a 1-0 lead.

That lead disappeared in the next
inning, however, when Geneva’s
Mitchell homered over the left field
wall with Shaffer on second base to
give the 2-1 lead to the Tornadoes.

The Panthers had a perfect chance
to take, the lead back in the bottom of
the third inning, when Walsh came to
the plate with the bases loaded and
only one out. However, the
\\ Tornadoes made getting out of a jam

when Shaffer blasted a Rakers pitch

The Panthers finally came alive to
tie the game in the bottom half of the
same inning, when Reese tripled to
the gap in right center field — driving
in Roth —— and then scored when
Carrol’s relay throw to third went into
the parking lot.

Geneva managed to take the lead
back with a run in the top of the fifth,
but that was to be the team’s last
score, the game was all Pitt after that.

The Panthers had their way with the
Geneva pitching staff, scoring five
runs over the next four innings, to
provide the four-run margin of victo-
ry.

The Panthers next game is today,

when they take on Gannon University
at Trees Field.
Bunts and Bruises: With two outs in
the top of the ninth inning, a foul ball

immediately by medical technicians
on the scene, Rosen got to his feet
and walked off the field. He was
taken to the Eye 8: Ear Institute for
observations.

important
goals,” Penguin Coach
Scotty Bowman said.
“He means so much to
the team, especially on
the Mario line. They
had Lamb on Mario,
watching him pretty
close tonight. When
you have a defenseman
that can jump up like
Larry then it opens up
the offense.

"Mario is pretty good
at bringing the
defenseman over by a
defender, and it creates
an opening. You need
a defenseman who
will take advantage of
that.”

The Pens’ 11th
straight victory —— three
shy of the NHL record
—— puts them on par
with some of the great-
est teams in history, a
fact that Lemieux did
not overlook.

“There were some
great teams —
Montreal was always
up there, Edmonton,
and the [New York]
Islanders in the 1970s
had some so we’re
starting to show that
we’re up there with
some of the great
teams,” he said.

Pens’ defender Kjell
Samuelsson notched
his third goal of the
season on a wrist shot
at 8:18 of the first to
open the scoring.

Also scoring for
Pittsburgh was Ron
Francis, who fired a
pair of goals by
Sidorkiewicz.

Lauire Boschman,
Brad Shaw, Dave
Archibald and Jody
Hull registered goals
for Ottawa, with
Shaw’s goal at 1257 of
the first giving the
Senators their only lead
of the game, a 2-1
advantage.

The win gives the
Penguins a total of 29
at home and 50 overall
— a new franchise
record.

«It also gives them
momentum going into
the final month of the
regular season.

“We just want to fin—
ish strong,” Murphy
said. “The President’s
Trophy [awarded to the
team with the highest

-- number of points at the

end of the season] is a
concern, but the num-
ber-one factor is we’d
like to keep our play
elevated going into the
playoffs because if you
don’t you’re not going
to do well.”

Gymnastics

Continued from page 13
said to my mother, ‘I’m going
to do that someday.”’
Ultimately, it was my decision
to begin gymnastics, but
because of my hyperness my
mother did not hesitate to

enroll me in a local gymnastics '

club.”
Brown owes her eventual

success to her local school dis-‘

trict.

“I was in third grade when
our school went on strike,
which lasted into October,”
Brown said. “There was
absolutely nothing for me to
do. I was bouncing off the
walls and literally breaking
things throughout the whole
house. My mom could take it
no longer, so she opened up
the yellow pages and enrolled
me in a gymnastics club.”

Performing on the club was
extremely difficult for both
Jorgensen and Brown.
Jorgensen said that even
though the competition may
be stiffer on the collegiate
level, herschedule was much
more demanding in her earlier

years.
“On an average day I would

:17

wake up early, go to school,
leave school early, drive about
an hour to the gym, practice
until 9 p.m., then drive home,
do my homework, eat and
then go to bed,” Jorgensen
said. “The same routine.repeat-
ed itself six days a week, every
week.”

At a young age in club com-
petition the foundation was set
for a successful career, but col-
lege was where everything fell
into place. Jorgensen said that
by the end of high school she
was frustrated with gymnas-
tics, so coming to Pitt was an
opportunity for a fresh start.
Brown was not even a good
gymnast until her junior year
of high school when she final-
ly became scholarship materi-
al. For both, college is where
they were able to reach their
potential and perform to the
best of their abilities.

“Kristin and I have learned’

and improved a lot over the
past four years,” Jorgensen
said.

Saying they have improved
over the years is quite the
understatement. The numbers
they have produced during

their careers speak for them-
selves.

Coming into the season,
Jorgensen had an abundance
of accomplishments to her
name. She was chosen for the
ECAC All-Conference Team for
her performance during her
first year at Pitt. During the
same season, Jorgensen was
named ECAC Gymnast of the
Week and tied for second in
the ﬂoorexercise at the ECAC
Championships.

Jorgensen’s strength has
been her consistency. She has
been someone the team could
always depend on because she
always does what is expected
of her. The same held true for
the 1993 campaign.

This year’s highlights include
a career-high 9.5 on the
uneven parallel bars, a career-
best 9.7 on the ﬂoor, a career-
high 9.7 on bars (at one time
good enough to tie her for first
on Pitt’s all-time list) and a
career all-around effort of
37.65. She did this despite an
elbow injury that she suffered
last season, which was sup-
pose to hamper her perfor-
mance this season.

II--‘STUDENT
GVERN MEN T

Allocations Committee

Brown has also had a career
full of remarkable accomplish-
ments. During her junior year,
she served as co-captain and
received the honor of being
named the team’s MVP for the
1991—’92 season. In that same
season, Brown qualified for
the NCAA Northeast Regionals.

Other feats include being the
number one all-arounder dur-
ing her first year, and coming
into this season she had made
the top 10 all-tirne list a total of
10 times.

Like Jorgensen, Brown put
forth her best effort in this her
last season of collegiate com-
petition. Brown earned career
bests as well as school records
helping her to earn the recog-
nition as one of the best com-
petitors in Pitt gymnastics his-
tory. ’

This season, Brown earned a
career-best 9.4 on vault, a 9.65
on bars (which tied her career
high) and a 9.75 on the floor,
which is also a career high.
The 9.75 she earned on the
beam and the all around of
38.45 places her tops on the
Pitt all-time list on the those
events.

Both gymnasts said that what
makes their friendship so spe-
cial is the respect and admira-
tion they have for one another.

“Karen is the best presenting
gymnast you will ever see,”
Brown said. “She presents her-
self and carries herself both in
the gym and outside the gym
better than any gymnast I have
seen.”

“Kristin is one of the most
modest and unselfish people I
have ever met,” Jorgensen
said. “She is the most solid and
steady competitor that could
be found anywhere; she is the
go-to gymnast, a real team
leader and player.”

Ever since that first meet
their friendship and careers
have come a long way. They
are the type of people any
coach would want on his/her
team. For four years, they were
always ready to compete and
wiling to give it their all. That
will end this weekend as they
compete in their final meet at
this weekend’s Northeast
Regionals.

They are the best of friends,
they have been the best of
gymnasts.
