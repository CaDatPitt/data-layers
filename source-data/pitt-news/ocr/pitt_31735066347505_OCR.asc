David H. V Kurtzman, Pitt's

chancellor emeritus, died yesterday
_ at Presbyterian University Hospital
- at the age of 73.

He was acting chancellor, then
chancellor of the University from
1966-67 and was named chancellor
emeritus in 1967. At that time he
told a commencement audience,
“To work at improving society in a
world as complex as this one, it is

and a willingness to expend effort.
You also must have knowledge-
not just the knowledge you
accumulate during one single
tgﬁsustained effort at formal learning
-—-but continuing knowledge, fresh
each day.”

Spring Concert Suffers Snags

BY THERESA MULAC

The production schedule for the
.1 spring concert, co-produced by the
' Student- Government (SG) Concert
Programming Committee and the
Black Action Society (BAS), has
been delayed because of snags in
the selection of a group, according
to SG Concert ‘Programming
co-Chairman Tim Stoops. ‘
The main problem the two groups
are having with the production is
the selection of a group which is
acceptable to both a white and black
crowd, Stoops said last week.
Selecting a date and location for
the concert is another problem the

if,

two groups are facing, according to .

Joy Wilson of the BAS Program-
ming Committee. ‘

“A group cannot be selected until

a date and location are set,” she

said. “In previous years the BAS

' spring concert would be ready for
production by this time,’ but as of

Q3 now we ‘don’t. _even have a.-group. '

students. A poll is taken to survey
what groups black students would
like to see. If a concert is going to be

_co-produced it has to have the

interest of the black student in mind
or we would be going against what
BAS stands for,” Wilson said.

Last spring BAS and the SG
Concert Programming Committee
each requested funds for a 1977
spring concert and were rejected by
the Student Government Alloca-
tions Committee. The Student
Government Board (SGB) suggest-
ed BAS and the Concert Program-
ming Committee co-produce the
spring concert rather than produce
two separate concerts.

Two locations are being consider-
ed for the concert: the Syria
Mosque and the Pitt Field House.

..The Syria Mosque will not accept
;any groups of a rowdy nature,
Stoops said, but it would be more
difficult to'produce the [show at the
Field House. Stoops also said the
acoustics at the,Eield House would u

not.f:be_,of the ,same quality as the

BAS and the concert Program-
ming Committee have met several
times to narrow down the possibili-
ties of groups. There will be two
groups; one selected by the
Programming Committee to attract
both a white and black crowd and a
group selected by BAS which will
interest primarily black students. ,

Tentatively Rufus had been
chosen for the concert last week. but
according to .Wilson, nothing had
been conﬁrmed.

“After leaving a meeting with the
Programming Committee two
weeks ago I had the impression/that
Rufus was the general consensus
for the opening group, but at the
SGB meeting last Wednesday, the
idea seemed to be gone,” Wilson
said.

Although there have been some
snags in the concert’s production
schedule because set guidelines
have not been drawn up, the

“I think we have to build on the
‘alert methods that are already
available andimprove them,” Bozik
said. _ '

Bozik, said the University needs
better communications to get the
information out as quickly as
possible to the public news media.

Joseph Dutton, vice chancellor
for business and ﬁnance, had high
praise for the alert network now in

GSO approached attorneys outside
the University for advice.

“A lawyer said we could hold this
poll just as long as we used the
results for ﬁling purposes or for_ our
own propaganda,” Reddington
said. “For instance,” he said,‘.
“FAS-GSO could use results
favoring a collective bargaining
agent as a representative percen-
tage of graduate students urging
unionization.’ ’

But FAS-GSO cannot coerce 7
University faculty and staff to abide
by the results of the poll. “We

cannot present our information to _,

FAS and bind them to the poll’s__
results,” Reddington said. ’

Bob Nelson, a Union of Graduate
Employees member, explained why
this poll was petitioned.

“About three years ago we ﬁled a

Board would not sponsor V our

the University but they weren’t sure
that we were considered employes,
under the Pennsylvania Labor
Relations Act 195. We are waiting

for court clariﬁcation,” Nelson said.

BY PETE BUTCH

Although the University is
investigating alternative sources of
energy, it is also researching ways
to alleviate pollution and disease as
a result of energy production.

Dr. C.C. Li, a professor of
electrical engineering and compu-
ter science, is working on a project
that will use computers to detect
coal miners’ black lung disease at
an early stage.

Black lung disease is one of the
medical problems that stand in the
way of the search for energy. It is a
debilitating disease caused by the
inhalation of coal dust. If caught in
time, those afflicted can be treated

effectively; if too late, they are

plagued with shortness of breath for
the rest of their lives.

Working with Li are Dr. Donald
Sashin, an associate professor of
radiology in the Medical School;
and Martin Savol, an electrical
engineering graduate student.
Their work is supported by grants
from the National Science Founda-
tion and the Pennsylvania Depart-
ment of Health.

The project has three parts:
developing a computer program to
process images of worker's chest

,x-rays; development of electronic

radiographs of the chest that will
use a level of x-rays of less than 20
percent of levels used today—red-
ucing the hazard to those tested and
allowing more frequent testing; and
finding a correlation between
pulmonary function tests and black
lung.

iDetection of a disease is called
patient recognition. Current
patient recognition techniques find
evidence of black lung when it is too
late for treatment; the tests are used
merely for disability claims. The
Pitt research team expects to be
able to detect black lung early

enough so that treatment will allow
those afflicted to lead a normal life.

Construction of a patient recogni-
tion lab in Benedum Hall will be
completed by May. It will consist of
a mini-computer, a TV scanner and
a color display monitor that will also
create photographic images.

Li and Sashin have also
developed a computerized method
to detect radiation poisoning in
those who work with nuclear
materials. Technicians usually
carry out the work which consists of
looking fordamaged chromosomes
in tissue samples of those exposed.
The researchers developed a
computer technique that completes
the task in approximately ﬁve
minutes. The work was supported
by a National Institute of Health
grant.

Dr. Byron Gottfried, a professor
in the industrial engineering
department, is currently working on
two computer simulation projects.

One uses a computer to
determine the most efﬁcient way for
a plant to remove sulfur from coal.
Coal is crushed and its sulfur is
removed before it is sent for
burning or coking.

The computer allows the plant
manager to look at alternative ways
,to run the plant; it tells which
methods have greater product yield
and less pollutants.

The computer looks at operating
alternatives and selects the most
appropriate.

The project is sponsored by the
Environmental Protection Agency
and. the Bureau of Mines.

The other project, supported by
the National Science Foundation,
uses a computer to simulate an
advanced scheme for recovering oil.
Most current methods leave half of
the oil behind when a well is
considered depleted.

The scheme proposed will inject
air underground and burn a portion
of the oil. When this happens, only

a small portion burns and the rest is

—— pushed out by the advancing

combustion front.

Researchers involved would like
to be able to determine how much
air to inject the theoretical yield and
the economics behind the move. A
computer simulation allows an
estimate of this information.

According to Gottfried, this
method is not new and has been
ﬁeld tested on and off for the past 15
years. Oil companies claimed to be
interested but didn’t take the idea
seriously because of a glut of oil on
the market, Gottfried said.

Research like this, previously
kept on a back burner by the oil
companies, has suddenly become
important, he explained.‘

The air-injection/ combustion will
not work for all oils, he said. Cali-
fornia crude will work exceptionally
well because it burns so well.
Texas, Oklahoma and Kentucky
crudes will also work well. Pennsyl-
vania crudes are high quality
lubricants and consequently do not
burn very well. The technique will
not work for them, Gottfried
explained.

Natural Gas Prices

BY MARY HUZINEC

Natural gas prices will never be
low again, according to Walter
Rogers, ‘ manager of corporate
communications for Equitable Gas.

Cutbacks from major pipeline
suppliers and the unusually cold
weather has decreased the supply of
natural gas and, in effect, increased
prices, Rogers said.

“It’s just something people will
have to accept," he said. “Energy
prices were so low before, they were
just taken for granted.”

Rogers explained that Equitable
stores gas in depleted wells, half of
which is a cushion not intended for
use.

“We’re using this capitalized
gas now,” Rogers said. “'And
pressure is so low that gas can’t be
pumped out quickly enough to meet
the tremendous demands created
by the cold weather.”

According to Rogers, the solution
to the natural gas shortage lies in
the deregulation of gas prices.

. “Government regulation on the

"interstate market isn’t proﬁtable for

independent drillers,” he said.
“They can sell their gas within state

hit with the gas shortage, Rogers

said, because it is dependent on

natural gas. Large corporations like
Jones and Laughlin and United
States Steel are on a plant

Gas, which means they are alloted
only enough gas to protect

He added that if gas supplies
continue to fall, Pittsburgh’s job

“Our main concern is to supply

said. “Human service comes ﬁrst.

“Unfortunately it takes some- 1

“In a 1973 edition of ‘Equitable

the United States will never again
be able to meet all of its gas energy
needs from conventional sources.
People thought we were ‘crying
wolf,’ " he said. ‘ ‘But now there are
remarkable shortages.”

Fieldhouse To Cost Students

immigrant to Chancellor

A part of the University died yesterday. David Kurtzman, educator,
scholar and statesman, is dead but his achievements continue.

Kurtzman’s publications earned him a high position within
Pennsylvania Governor David Lawrence’s government as an education
expert. This led to his appointment as Vice Chancellor of the University
of Pittsburgh in 1965.

I It was Kurtzman who engineered Pitt’s state-related status; the
University was 19.5 million dollars in debt at the time. And it was he who
fought the second-rate status it was feared this move would bring.

Six months later he was named acting chancellor upon the sudden
death of Chancellor Stanton Crawford. Kurtzman’s appointment as
chancellor soon followed. V
, Ki1itzman’s administration was butashorttvvo years. Butinthattiine
he not only bailed Pitt out by negotiating its state-related status, but
stood up to Helen Clay Frick when she made unreasonable demands
over the control of a sum of money she donated to the University.

In other crises, Kurtzman was never one toissue statements that

conflicted with his policy of honesty and directness in order to soothe I

damaged egos.

Kiirtznian’sterm as chancellor was short, but his imprint is a lasting
one. Retirement did not bring inactivity. His tenure as chancellor
emeritus and senior advisor to the University was one of great

’ productivity.

I In death, the highest tribute to Kurtzman is the growth of the
University and the rise in many areas that can be attributed to him.

Questioning SGB Logic

The Student Government Board’s (SGB) move to structure itself in a
form similar to what defeated referendum two called for last month is a
questionable move indeed. '

The structural change is not wrong. We endorsed the referendum the
day before the election and still support it.

The referendum called for the election of Board members who would
not serve at large but as vice-presidents charged with directing speciﬁc
areas within the domain of Student Govermiicnt. The bill insures a more
complete utilization of the energies of each Board member by giving
them speciﬁc areas to concentrate their efforts.

However, the appropriateness of the move is questioned. The
students decided against the bill, 1047 to 865. Why they chose to vote
this way and whether it was a wise decision was not evident on that day.
What was obvious, though, was that students did not desire
implementation of referendum two.

The wording of the referendum on the ballot was ambiguous.
Students may have vetoed it because they didn't understand it, or they
disagreed with part of it or were totally against it. That is not for us or the
SGB to assume. '

A referendum is not a survey circulated through the mail, it is not
going down to the Towers lobby and rapping with the loiterers to gather
input. It is a vote given to students so that they may have the ﬁnal say
over the implementation of a plan.

For the SGB to go ahead and activate something similar to referendum
two after a . majority voted against it is to ignore the power of a
referendum in a democratic system and overlook the right of the student.
electorate to choose the form of government that is to rule_them. I‘

We question the ingications of the Board’s move in overlooking the

student's response to e referendum and the precedent it may set in the
long run. ‘

BY GARY GOVERT

Not long ago, a student wrote to
the Pitt News complaining bout ‘an
unpleasant confrontation with a
pair of’ Christian evangelists.
Having innocently agreed to answer
a “religious questionnaire,” the
student had been suddenly assailed
with an embarrassing inquisition
into his personal beliefs.

Although I wasn't sure why the
protesting student was embarras-
sed, I couldn’t help but sympathize
with his plight. Up-against-the-wall
evangelism doesn’t appeal to "me
either‘. I especially dislike the
evangelism forced upon students in
many university classrooms.

Evangelism in the secular

universities is, of course, seldom of
'the Christian varieVty—but it is no

less religious. Unfortunately, the
evangelistic literati seldom seem to
recognize the religious character of
their perspectives on biology,
history, economics, political sci-
ence, etc. Among the secular
intelligentsia, evangelism is widely

- regarded as a dirty word.

But a belief in God, as a
supernatural entity, is not a prere-
quisite to activistic religious
commitment.

The identification or a person’s
religion generally hinges upon what
he or she has posited as the apex of
reality, the ground of truth, or the
source of redemption-whether
that be God or old socks or man
himself. Having chosen our
ultimate, we invest our faith in it
and proceed to make our decisions,
formulate our hopes and live our
lives according to that faith.
Without exception, everyone be-
lieves in something, even if that
something is nothing.

It is essential to recognize that

'__man’s perspective on how he should

think and act is very much
dependent upon his perception of
God. '

If Jesus of Nazareth is God, we
should live our lives according to the
principles he preached. If ‘technolo-
gy is God, we_ should seek salvation

from our machines. If man himself '

is God, it is there that wemust place
our faith if we are to be delivered
from the troubles of the world. Most
of us tend to synthesize different
perspectives and seldom hold
absolutely to the requirements of
one faith.

Since each university professor
lives, thinks and therefore teaches
within the context of one belief
system or another, he or she cannot
avoid being evangelistic. His point
of view. the underpinnings of which
are ultimately religious. is somehow

Z Cris Hall, Features Editor - -

perspectives on the nature of man
(which imply perspectives on the
nature of God)—and all four, to
name a few, are ardently promoted
at Pitt.

Evangelistic teaching is common
to all disciplines, but it is probably
most easily. ‘identiﬁed in the
sciences. Prof. William Keeton,
writing in ‘ ‘Biological Science’ ’ (the
basic text for Pitt's organismic
biology course), says: “(By) the
latter part of the nineteenth
century...the theory of evolution
was able to account for the origin of
species without invoking a super-
natural agency. Can twentieth-cen-
tury science do the same for the
origin of life itself?”

Keeton says that we are “able to
account for the origin of species
without invoking a supernatural
agency”——by which I assume he
means God. Whether Keeton has
forgotten that evolution is a theory
and should not be treated as
dogmatic truth is not clear from the
sentences quoted. In fact, he has
forgotten and he occasionally
reminds his readers that not
everyone agrees with him.

Meanwhile, however, Keeton
builds an 888-page book around the
evolutionary model. It is not
difficult to identify the “truth” he
has found, and what he thinks
beginning biology students should
also believe. The team‘ of organis-
mic biology teachers does not
significantly deviate from Keeton’s
fundamental view of organic reality,
as any visit to class will show.

The implications of Prof. Kee-
ton’s query—'-“Can twentieth-cen-
tury science do the same for the
origin of life itself?”——are very
serious. By simply asking the
question, Keeton has run smack

’p Agast the Wall’ Srategy

into what has been called “the
myth of neutrality.”

Rather than gathering data,
studying it and formulating theory
from avneutralpoint of view, Keeton A

has an idea he believes in
(evolution), and now he is seeking
“facts’ ’ that will enable him to carry
his idea to its logical conclusion.
Given that everyone lives and thinks
according to his beliefs, what are
the odds that Prof. Keeton will
approach his supposedly neutral
facts in a wholly objective manner?
Won’t what he ﬁnds depend in large
measure upon what he is looking
for?.Won’t what he looks for be
largely determined by his precon-
ceived notion of organic reality?
Inescapable subjectivity does not

negate "the. value of scientiﬁc '

research, but it demands an
admission of the perspective from
which that research is conducted.
Otherwise, any claim as to the
validity of a theory or interpretation
is tainted with an odor of
deception.

Though vitally important, a
discussion of fossil Stratiﬁcation,
dating and other problems that. call
evolutionary theory into question
would be inappropriate here. This is

not a biological treatise nor am I a -

biologist. Still, scientific facts are
not the only variables in an equation
of truth. On the basis of my religious
and philosophical beliefs’, I cannot
accept the views of man and God
inherent in a macro-evolutionary
perspective.

So I am faced with a problem. The
secular universities pride them-
selves on their break with
dogmatism, but if I want to take a
basic biology course at Pitt, I have
no choice but to‘ — be force-fed
.Keeton'.s brandof evangelism and
the"“'facts” he has derived from his
religiously-directed research.

Black Demand Stand Aired Reader Claims Security

Action Ruined Concert"

Last November the Concerned
Black Students (CBS) marched in
nonviolent protest of continued
racist practices at Pitt. At the end
of the march CBS presented a series
of demands and grievances to
Student Government. Three
months later, action has been taken
on only one issue raised by
CBS—investigation of campus po-
lice practices. (The University has
adopted a task force report on
campus police activities.) All other
CBS concerns and recommenda-
tions have been ignored. Even in
the face of recent evidence which
reveals declining black enrollment
at Pitt, the University administra-
tion and Student Government
remain unresponsive‘ to the protest
of Pitt’s black students.

-In a position paper that evolved
from our Workshop on Racism and
Sexism at Pitt, held last March, the
Union of Graduate Employees
(UGE) committed itself to ﬁght
racist practices at the University
and to educate the University
community about racism. In line
with this pledge, the UGE supports
the protest march and demands of
the CBS and particularlyendorses
the following concerns of the CBS):

1) S Increased admission of black
students: recent ﬁgures indicate
that there were 348 black ﬁ_rst year
students at Pitt in 1974 and 298 in
1976. The UGE is apalled at this
decline in black enrollment. The
University administration, in con-

letters from readers. Letters for
publication must be typewritten»
triple-spaced-_-and include the
writer's name and be accompanied
by a signature. Because of the
large volume of mail received we
are unable to return unpublished
letters. Due to space limitations,
the PITT NEWS cannot guarantee -
that all letters will be published

submissions.

S J

junction with the Black Action
Society and other groups of black
students, should develop policies to
increase the number of black
students at Pitt. ’

2) Support services: the UGE
recognizes that merely increasing
admission of black students is not
enough. Support services must be
offered to guard against attrition.
Special ﬁnancial assistance pro-
grams must be provided to aid

black students. The administration ‘

should expand and upgrade the
University Community Educational
Programs (UCEP). In addition, the
University administration should
work with black student groups to
set up suitable housing arrange-
ments and social activities for black

, students. -

3) Black studies: the black
studies department must be
recognized as an essential part of
the University. Cutbacks in person-
nel and the overall level of funding
must be restored.

4) Tuition hikes: the UGE, a
member of the Student Coalition
Against Tuition Hikes (SCATH),
recognizes that increases in tuition
cause ﬁnancial hardship for all
students but especially hurt black
and other minority students. We

,oppose any further tuition hikes and

call for an end to the general drift
toward an all-white, upper-middle
class student body already set in
motion by increases in tuition.

5) The community: the adminis-
tration must develop a more open
and cooperative stance toward the
community. The University should
make its facilities more accessible to
community residents and sponsor
special programs in conjunction
with community groups.

_ 6) South Africa: racism is not a
problem conﬁned to Pitt nor the
United States. The University of
Pittsburgh, as an institution of
higher learning ostensibly devoted
to the pursuit of humanitarian
ideals, should support the growing
movement to stop black oppression

by calling for the end of minority
rule in South Africa.

The UGE believes that the
demands of black students must be
addressed immediately. We
further believe that the primary
responsibility for meeting the needs
of black students and for elimina-
ting racist practices at Pitt in
general lies with the University
administration.

As it has made clear through its
failure to respond to the demands of
CBS, the administration will not
accept this responsibility on its own.
Only broadly-based support for
immediate attention to the issues
raised by the CBS will force the
administration to act.

The UGE pledges its support for
this ﬁght. We call upon other
individuals and groups to show their
opposition to racism by similarly
pledging support for the positions
taken by CBS. And we urge the
newly-elected Student Government
Board members to act on the CBS
demands immediately and to carry
these demands to the University
administration.

Wednesday, Eebruary 23, 1‘977—TH‘E‘PlTTTN‘EWS—Page= 5 

I would like to attack M. Patrick
Monahan for the interview he wrote
concerning Steve Hillage (Pitt
News, February 21, 1977). Mr.
Monahan does not seem to be aware
of the fact that I, as well as every

other person who attended the

recent Electric Light Orchestra
concert, was treated like a criminal
upon entering the Arena and was
further hassled by the ushers
inside. It seems as though anyone
who vaguely resembles what is
commonly known as a “rowdy”
concert-goer has to submit to the
cold and impersonal scrutiny of
Civic Arena Security. I resented the
fact that I was even suspected of
concealing an alcoholic beverage,
the target of Arena security, and
unfortunately Mr. Monahan does
not seem to care. His article
suggests that the concert was
similar to any other social event in
the Pittsburgh area, when in fact it
was not. Personally, I have never

‘been searched upon entering a

movie theater, Heinz Hall, a Pitt
concert or any other concert for that
matter. I ﬁnd it a degrading
practice.

Certainly there are those who
become dangerous with a beer 01‘
wine bottle in their hands, but why
does everyone have to suffer? In
order to obtain liquor in the state of
Pennsylvania, the buyer must be

twenty-one years of age and have in

his possession legitimate proof of
age. Nonetheless, alcohol is readily
obtainable to minors and it is
unfortunate that the law is so
leniently enforced. »

I am not, by any standards, a

. dangerous criminal and resent the

fact that I am lumped into the same

category with the ‘ ‘rowdy?’ concert-

goer. I feel this is an example of ‘

discrimination on the part of Arena
management. Furthermore, Mr.
Monahan’s lack of awareness only
serves to enrage me even more. It is
reviews like his that leave the
problem unresolved and, hence, the
problem continues to exist.
What's more, after shelling out

15 bucks for tickets for me and my .

date, I should at least have been
afforded the courtesy I would
normally receive. In the futile
attempt to exercise control over the
10.000-plus who attend concerts at
the Arena, it is people like myself

who do the suffering. The concerts,

produced in this town are in certain
need of rational organization and if
the blatant disregard for the
average concert-goer, which _Mr.
Monahan exhibits, continues/to
ﬂourish, the situation will never be
remedied. Why, in the pursuit of
“good” journalism, does thetruth
so often get thrown  ’in"" the

. Mayor Pete Flaherty:
City Boy Makes Good

3

 
  
 

 

Editor’s Note: This article is the
result of a one-half hour interview
with Pete Flaherty held last week,
before word from Washington had it
that Flaherty was being “seriously
considered” for the number-two
position in the Justice Department.

BY LEN ROMBERG

“After' eight years of‘ the
Nixon-Ford administration, we

7

have nowhere to go but up,’ said
Pittsburgh mayor Pete Flaherty at
the beginning of an interview
focusing on the city, its future, and
the Carter administration.

“I’m much more optimistic about
how Pittsburgh will fare with the
new administration. President Car-
ter has said many times that he is
going to be sensitive to the needs of
the cities,” said Flaherty. “I
believe he'll take a deeper
interest.”

Apparently the recipie_nt"' of a
“th anks-for-the-support’ ’  position

from Carter, the mayor“ will

probably be leaving‘ "Pittsburgh
soon. His exact “title-to‘-be” is U.S.
Deputy; Attorney. ‘General. Pitts-
burgh’s eight years under him have
been marked by budget conserva-
tism, low itaxesiand less services.

Flaherty was one of the first
major politicians to support Carter
in last spring’s primaries. ‘He
helped to deliver important votes._in
the Pennsylvania’ primary and,
later, in the general election.

His close relationship with the
President was evident during
Carter’s recent visit to Pittsburgh at
the peak of the energy crunch.
Flaherty explained, “As to my role
in the planning of the visit,-I did

 

speak with members of the White

House staff the day prior to the visit.
I encouraged them to consider
Pittsburgh. '

“The staff, however, makes the
ﬁnal decision in connection with the
President...One of the major
reasons he came to Pittsburgh was
because it was in helicopter. range.
He wanted to ﬂy in by helicopter
and do a ﬂyover (see the situation
close up)”. '»

Although Flaherty cautioned, “I
don’t want to imply that Pittsburgh
will receive a cozy _ arrangement
with President Carter,” he made it
clear he was relying on a friendlier
federal government to pick up the
tab for expensive city projects.

“I believe no city, including
Pittsburgh, can make it completely
on its own tax base...We service an
area of two million people coming in
and out of the city at various times, ”
said Flaherty, who noted that
one-third of Pittsburgh’s land—its
universities, cultural areas and
hospitals—is tax-exempt.

“The city taxpayers shouldn’t be
expected to support all of these
services without some aid from the
federal government.”

After burying the Skybus project,
he said, he supported the light-rail
vehicle (inner-city train) and several
other urban mass transit programs
as well as highway, housing and job
projects, all to be federally funded,
as the newsouth PATway is now.

' The mayor was quick to support
Carter when asked how he rated the
President’s economic recovery
plan. “I think it’s a‘ good one
because he has included jobs as well

. as the tax cut,” said Flaherty, who

echoed Carter's words, labeling the
plan “a balanced program.”

— The package‘ contains a $30‘

billion tax cut and $5 billion‘in
job-creating programs. ~Flaherty
acknowledged," “there's not as
much in there (economic proposal)
as some people would like but,
because of the severity of the
winter, there’s a good chance that
the package will be amended as it
goes through the legislative process
to provide even more jobs than

Randi Escapes with Cheers

BY CRIS HALL

“I’m the guy you came to see,”
announced Randi, a magician ‘and
escape artist, as he began a
program for some 250 students
yesterday afternoon at the Student-
Union ballroom.

And, after apologizing for
“wearing a blue tie with a tuxedo,”
the balding, old-yet-fit man ran off a
series of demonstrations that
brought on a series of enthusiastic
ovations.

“I’m a liar, a cheat, a fraud and a
charlatan,” Randi cautioned from
the outset. But the crowd, if its
reaction was any indication,
thought he came close enough to
reconstituting ripped newspapers
and producing bottles from seem-
ingly empty air to reward him with
ovations time and again.

Though many, of his ‘one-liners -

missed, his delivery was coura-
geous enough to carry him through
a rather dull monologue that served
as introduction to one of his feats.
But hestill had enough voice after
the speech to utter several strange
noises and seemingly join some 20
ripped pieces of newsprint to form a
whole Pitt News. “You know,” he
said, ‘ ‘I'm afraidl really don.’t know
just how that’s done.”
‘ Two volunteers assisted Randi on

. his next trick. After telling the pair
to “tie a knot around my
wrists...sometime today, if poss-
ible,” he effortlessly and quickly
negated the bonds, freeing his
hands. Nothing spectacular, to be
sure, but the crowd liked it.

Then, after admonishing her
that, “sometimes, the closer you
are, the less you see,” Randi led a
confused ‘female subject through a
"somewhat amusing game of
“where’s that handkerchief.”

But that got a bit boring after a
while, so he went on to a game of
“Sherlock Holmes,”. in which he
correct1y_ matched 10‘small items-
enclosed in envelopes—with their

i-‘owners. He used facial expressions
of the volunteers to pull this one off.

The three best items on the
agenda were saved for last. Randi

' offered two volunteers $50 for
successfully affixing him to a chair,
using two 50-foot lengths of rope, in
such a manner as Randi could not
escape. It took him longer to free
himself of the strand tying his belt
loop to the chair than it -did to

makeshift stage. — I

Employing a trick many students
would no doubt enjoy emulating,
Randi seemingly pulled an endless
strin g of liquor bottles from a pair of
what appeared to be cardboard
tubes. “lthink that deserves a huge
round of applause,” he said as h'e
ﬁnished. He got it.

His ﬁnal feat involved a strait
jacket. After having several
volunteers secure him in the jacket,
Randi hyperventilated “because I
have to let the air completely out of
my lungs as I do this.” Already
winded, Randi began to jerk and
squirm and, after turning a shade of

RIPPIN G BUFFALO OFF WHILE
DIGGIN G HER OUT

BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP)—Wid-
ening reports of “ripoffs” in
digging Buffalo out of its Jan. 28
blizzard spread Tuesday as investi-
gators sought to learn whether
$250,000 in towing bills submitted
to the city were legitimate.

‘‘It was a ripoff’s dream,” streets
Commissioner James C. Linder
said.

He indicated there were double
billings and bills for towing
stranded motor vehicles that never
took place.

Earlier, it was disclosed that the
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,
which hired contractors for snow-

removal, reported receiving com-
plaints of extortion attempts.

Lt. Col. Bryon G. Walker, deputy
director ofthe Corps‘ Buffalo office,
said some contractors were told
they had to pay a fee to remove
snow.

Investigators said a New Jersey
contractor, here with a fleet of eight
trucks, was confronted by a man
claiming to be a city official and who
asked for $500 “as a license fee to
operate on city streets.” There is no
such fee.

There were reports, too, that
5,000 gallons ofgasoline were taken
illegally from pumps at the city
garage.

Other reports indicated there
were widespread abuses in the

federal govemment’s free food
stamp distribution to workers who
lost pay because of the storm.

These included black-market sale
of the stamps and their use for such
things as stakes in card games and
liquor purchases.

Pittsburgh’s Gift To D . C.

initially proposed.

“There is discussion going on in
the Carter administration right
now,” he said, “about a second bill
which is not tied to the economic
package, which would provide fuel
stamps in $250 allotments for
people hit very hard by the severity
of winter."

Flaherty said the largest chal-
lenge facing Pittsburgh was more a
sociological problem. “Pittsburgh,
like many cities in the northeast
quadrant of the U.S., is an older
city. Our population is probably
tending more and more toward the
elderly.

‘ ‘We tend in the past two decades
to have lost a good number of our
younger people. The problem is
how to keep our younger people and
our middle-income people in the
city...” said Flaherty. Competition
from the sunbelt area of the country
is hindering the growth of this
region, he said.

Further exploitation of Pitts-

A burgh’s strengths was cited by

Flaherty as the best possible way to
reverse the trend. He painted a
positive picture of the city, adding,

“we do have several advantages in -»

the Pittsburgh area...for business

  
   

and industry. We’re not overly
populated such as New York City.
We’re a major city with the
atmosphere of a small town.”
Should cities like New York be
bailed out of ﬁscal trouble by Uncle

* Sam? Budget-conscious Flaherty

responded, “It depends on whether
or not New York as a city utilized its
own funds responsibly,» took
measures to cut down the deficit
and made a strong showing toward
balancing its budget.

A Boxing Blockbuster

BY M. C. PILECKI

Rocky
Directed by John G. Avildsen

When 'all_the hullabaloo clears,
“Rocky” isn’t a half bad movie.

But neither is it “Citizen Kane.”
The ﬂick has been stunning critics
around the country since its release
and the reason is not quite apparent
when one actually views it.

“Rocky” isvone of those “small”

. character studies, about a washed-

up, never-was ﬁghter in South
Philadelphia. The somewhat
likeable big lug of the title is clearly
more intelligent and sensitive than
people give him credit for—which
instantly endears him to the
audience.

In the course of the story, Rocky is
chosen at random to get the
“chance of a li‘fetime"——challeng-
ing for the heavyweight title of the
world through a caprice of
marketing and promotion. Sudden-
ly it looks like Rocky isn’t going to
be the loser everyone took him for,
including his best friend (Burt
Young) and the crusty old manager

. (Burgess Meredith).

Along the way there's the subplot
of.Rocky’s wooing and winning his
best friend's shy, ugly duckling
sister (Talia Shire), completely
dominating her and changing her
personality——not to mention looks.
But even thus transformed, the
character remains a shadow.

“Rocky” has some excellent.
moving scenes, particularly of his

training efforts and his sudden

realization that he can make good
after all. His exhiliaration is
apparent and easily shared by the

audience.
ﬁght of the ﬁnal scene is also easily
contagious.

No question about it—‘ ‘Rocky’ ’ is

a well made ﬁlm, and also, a real
man’s picture. Men can supposedly
identify with the sweaty characters
and their grim determination to
keep battering each other beyond
all sanity. And the problems of a
misunderstood stud can easily be
thought———or imagined—to be one’s
own.

Some people can be really turned

on by “Rocky,” and many will be
bored senseless or repelled by the

climactic scene. This is not to insult
a ﬁne movie, but only to point out
that its appeal is hardly universal.

It's quite understandable why
Sylvester Stallone refused to let

Even on the Small Screen

BY TOM WASELESKI

“The stage, she is the God-dam-
nedest woman you ever saw,” Neil
Diamond once said on a sultry
August night at Les Angeles’s
Greek Theatre.

On a particularly Pittsburgh rainy
evening last October, Diamond
stood aghast at the hawkers
peddling green glowing rings up
and down the Arena aisles. “Don’t
sell those during the show,” he
chided, “this isn’t Elvis Presley.
This is class.”

What for other artists amounts to
chattery ad libs are actually heart
and soul murmurings when they
come from the lips of Neil Diamond,
one of a tight handful of performers
whose showmanship draws super-
latives from critics.

“The audience is half of the
performance,” he explained at the
opening of his ﬁrst TV special
Monday night on NBC. “You can't
do it without them.”

Anyone who saw him at the Arena
knows it’s true, right down to the
marrow in the shaking pelvises in
section C-16.

Diamond’s recent return to the
Greek—captured on ﬁlm for his
prime time'—‘was probably,"-as good
a rendering as television could
offer of a musician whose concerts
have left cities breathless.

The audience effects that were
woven throughout the precious hour

' were honest, unlike other tapings

that focus on the crowd just to lend a

executed in simple, folkist strains.
The works in both of the exhibits
present us with an unpretentious
slice of respective cultures.

The older exhibit consists of small
artifacts of Mexican life—ﬁgurines
of dogs, snakes, turtles, palm-sized
women and men sculptures,

season. v

BY CRIS HALL

Though Pitt football coach Jackie Sherrill is still panting from the
effort involved in producing a recruiting crop beﬁtting a national
championship team, enough of the ink has settled to allow us a
preliminary appraisal of how the Panthers fared.

A look at what remains of last season's 12-0 unbeatens reveals a few
openings that must have caught >~Sherrill’s eye somewhere between
Pullman, Wash., and New Orleans. Johnny Majors’ ﬁrst class was a
honey, but its pupils are now headed for other things.

Departuresthat must have wrung the most nights’ sleep from Sherrill
were those of Jim Corbett, Carson Long, Larry Swider, several linemen
and the entire experienced linebacker corps. Running backs, receivers
and defensive backs were plentiful, but large linemen and talented toes
were not. So Sherrill, who played no small part in the string of events
that brought Tony Dorsett to Pitt, went in search of skilled seniors
possessing passable transcripts. A '

His best ﬁnds were local boys. One, Benjy Pryor, ﬁlls Jim Corbett’s

spot at tight end—and it may be a tight squeeze. He should start the '

season-opener at Florida.

Another, Penn Hills receiver Mike Christ, arrives at a position where
no immediate help is needed, but that won't diminish his contributions
to the team. A good head rides his shoulders and his hands are better.

The linemen are big and, unless‘ Sherrill has changed his criteria, they
should be good. One or two of those 260-pounders could nicely ﬁll the
holes left by graduating beef. The lines should be solid next year.

A couplelof quarterbacks were included on Sherrill’s ﬁnal list. Rick
Trocano of Cleveland is a good thrower, and Carlton Williamson of
Atlanta is a good athlete. (Williamson, not on Pitt’s original list, signed
recently, according to a good source.) “Trocano is like Cavanaugh and
Williamson is like Haygood,” said one Pitt source. Let’s hope so.

Two “name” backs also adorn the list of Panthers-to-be. “Rooster”
Jones and Artrell Hawkins carry great statistic-s, but these backshave a
way of fading away, so it remains to be seen how often they'll carry the
ball, and how far. i

Lindsay Delaney, a quarterback at Upper St. Clair who ﬁgures to ﬁt

5 elsewhere in Pitt’s plans, should be one of the better players to emerge

from this year’s eligibles. Let’s -hope he can play defense nearly as well
as his brother, Jeff. '  ~
A few defensive ends and linebackers will ﬁrst don the blue and gold

next season and anylhelp in those areas will be appreciated. _Cecil_

Johnson. Ed Wilamowski, Arnie Weatherington and,Jim Cramerallfare
'seniors. ‘ - ‘ "  '

There's no. doubt, many. if not most. of these recruits will turn out to‘_

be prunes, -mercifully passing through the Panthers’ system ‘without
noticeable incident. a But one of Sherrill's selections, passed over by
many choosing" among the Pitt prizes. could turn out to be the best of the
fruits to be gathered this year. At least. he could make the biggest
difference next season.

The recruit is Dave Trout‘. He stands but 5-8 and the scales tip him at
160. He’s from Mt. Pleasant. but you probably never heard of him‘. If
the Panthers are lucky. you will.

He kicks. Sometimes he kicks 60-yard ﬁeld" goals. according to a Pitt
press release. That could be just the kick Sherrill needs to stop that
awful panting.

INDIANA, Pa.—When a bas-
ketball season is nearly over and a
team can count its wins on the
ﬁngers of one hand, it doesn’t really
concern itself with the caliber of the
competition or the margin of
victory. -

Following Monday night’s unim-
pressive 76-59 win over Indiana (the
game was much closer than the
score indicates), Pitt basketball
coach Tim Grgurich was just thrilled
that he won a game. It was only the
Panthers’ ﬁfth such effort this
season in 24 tries and ﬁrst away
from home.

“We won,” said Grgurich
following the game. “I don't think
there’s anything else we needed.”

What the Panthers needed was a
more artistic showing against a 7-15
NCAA Division Two team that -has
lost to squads like Robert Morris
and Muskingum.

Pitt committed 21 fouls and 23
turnovers in the brutally physical
affair that Grgurich compared to a
football game. But if Tony Dorsett
and company had A played as
inconsistently, they, too, would
probably be able to count their wins
on one hand.

Pitt started out well enough,
working the ball in to 6-11 center Ed
Scheuermann, who was unstop-
pable by the outsized and
outclassed Indians. The lanky
freshman, who ﬁnished with 17
points and 16 rebounds, scored 10 of
Pitt’s ﬁrst 16 points, helping to open
up a 30-19 Pitt lead late in the ﬁrst
half. _

But the Panthers lacked any kind
of killer instinct, and at halftime
they hung on to a mere ﬁve-point
lead. _

“It’s a little bit frustrating the
way we turned the ball over,” said
Scheuermann. “When you’re eight
to 10 points ahead, that’s when
you’ve got to work for the good shot
and we weren’t doing it.”

The Panthers not only didn’t get
the good shot, they also stopped
getting the ball to Scheuermann in
the second half. Fifteen of
Scheuermann’s points came in the
ﬁrst 20 minutes. -

With Michael Rice missing most
of the second half because of an
aggravated thigh injury, the
Panthers watched their lead get
whittled down to just two points
when Elio Filippi tipped in a missed
Gary Kotsch free throw for Indiana.

Pitt came bouncing back though,
determined to ﬁnally win a road
game. Larry Harris, who snared 11

rebounds and led all scores with 20
points, slammed home a dunk shot
and bullied his way to the hoop on a
follow-up two plays later. In
between, Scott Nedrow made a steal
and scored on a breakaway.

Still, Indiana refused to die and
trailed by six points with just seven
minutes left. Pitt ﬁnally opened up

four comer offense to protect it.
While in the four corners, the
Panthers were able to establish
their comfortable, though deceiving
margin of victory.

“The ﬁnal score is not indicative
of the game,” said Indian head
coach Carl Davis in an understate-
ment. “I thought our kids played a
helluva game.

“I thought Pitt played well. Our
kids knew they were playing a
Division One team-—they’re gonna
want a piece of them. I thought our
kids rubbed bellies with them pretty
good.”

Though not artistic overall, the
game did have some ﬁne plays.
Harris was fantastic on several
dunks, but the most exciting plays
came from freshman Sonny Lewis.

Lewis scored only four points, but
he made two plays that had the
capacity crowd of 2,500 in disbelief.

Early in the game, with Pitt ahead
12-8, Indiana’s Bill Cashaw went
racing down the court for what he
thought would be an uncontested
lay-up. But Lewis, playing in the
ﬁrst half for the ﬁrst time in three
games because of two suspensions,
decided to vent some of his

frustrations.
As Cashaw was putting up the

ball, the 6-2 Lewis was hovering
above him, smacking the ball off the
glass and coming down with it. He
quickly ﬁred a full-court pass to
Harris, who scored on an easy dunk.
It was a key four-point play.

Later in the ﬁrst half, Lewis
leaped for a rebound of a
teammate’s shot, sailed high above
the rim, as high as the shooting
target tape, and slammed the ball
through the hoop. The appreciative
crowd erupted. The play is a beautv

SLIPPERY ROCK—For about 10
minutes, the realization that the
Pantherette track team was not
going to beat Slippery Rock last
weekend began to sink in. Down
39-38 with two events left, Pitt
needed at least second place in the
two-mile run. Shortly after the race
began, theyfound that this was not
tube the case.

- _' Without the-services of injured

‘distance runner Becky Falck, the
Pantherettes were swept in the race

and then trailed by 10 points before '

winning the mile relay and finishing
the meet down 48-43.

The Panthers return to action
tonight at Temple, then wrap up the
regular season against Duquesne at
the Civic Arena Sunday afternoon.

CAGE NOTES: David Washing-
ton, one of three players who
missed the ﬁrst half of the Penn
State game because of a curfew
violation, did not play at all, but
Grgurich said it was merely because
he was satisﬁed with the play of his
other guards...Dom Berardinelli
and Paul Kochka played for the ﬁrst
time all year and both got on the
scoreboard. ‘

Berardinelli sank a technical foul
shot when Indiana was called for
having too many men on the floor
and later fed Kochka for a four-foot
jumper th'at swished.

Indiana’s Kotsch scored the
1,000th point of his career on a free
throw in the second half and the
game was stopped while he was
awarded the ball. The senior guard,
who had made ten -straight free
throws at that point, proceeded to
miss the next three.

Pitt out-rebounded the Indians,
54-36, and shot a respectable 50.8
percent from the “floor.

l:0l.0. DeJesus was third with a
time of l:03.2.

In addition to the third-place
ﬁnish, DeJesus set records in the
50- and 100-yard breaststroke.

“Nila is a combination butter-
flier-breaststroker," said Pitt coach
Kate Mathison. “It’s odd for one
swimmer to excel in both events
because the strokes are so_different,
but she swims both very well.”

_Kluglein also qualiﬁed for the

’Ea,,st;e/rn Regionalsiwith a time of

30:2 and a ﬁrst-place’ ﬁnish in the

.- 5'0-yard backstroke.’ Jennifer Price

finished second in the event, .5 of a
second behind.

The record-breakers were not the
only Pitt" swimmers who turned in
exceptional performances.

Lisa Jarvis, although ﬁnishing
third, bettered her time by four
seconds in the 200-yard individual
medley.

“Lisa swam a very ﬁne race,"
Mathison said. “To cut that much
off your time in one race is
outstanding.” Jamie Conley won
the event with a time of 2:01.2.

Pitt’s divers dominated the
diving competition, ﬁnishing ﬁrst
and second in both the one- and
three-meter diving.

Linda Hamner scored 209.95
points to win the one-meter
competition. Cindy Ferraro was
second with 185.10.

In the three-meter competition,
Connie Heister was ﬁrst with 199.1
points and Ferraro was again
second with 190.6 points.

The team of Kluglein, Moran,

‘Elston and Price ended the

massacre with a victory in the
400-yard freestyle relay. _

The Pantherettes captured ﬁrst in
all but one event.‘ ,

Thus far, 14 members from the
Pantherette squad (four divers and
10 swimmers) will be going to
Delaware on March 3 - 5 for the
Eastern Regionals.

RIFLERS T0 snoor FOES

The Pitt riﬂe team will host
Western Pennsylvania Intercolle-
giate Rifle League rivals Clarion
and Washington and Jefferson
Friday, 6 p.m. at Trees Rifle Range.

BY PATTY TASCARELLA

The Pantherette basketball team
played an even .500 on their
four-game road trip last week,
crushing Temple and Villanova, but
falling to Maryland and highly-
regarded Immaculata.

“The road trip was just a little too
long,” admitted Pantherette assis-
tant coach Jean Balthaser. “They
were gettingtired.”

Maryland, an 82-53 winner,
played an extremely aggressive
game last Wednesday and was
especially formidable under the

boards, holding a 31-27 lead at the V
half and never letting up. '

‘ ‘What happened was we control-
led the boards in the ﬁrst half, but in
the second, they got control and
started their fastbreak,” Balthaser
said.

Center Wanda Randolph and
forward MiMi Senkowski paced the
Pantherettes against Maryland with
15 points apiece. Former Pitt center
Debbie Jones, who transferred to
Maryland last summer, was used
sparingly‘ and collected only ﬁve
points. -

Thursday's 90-61 conquest of
Temple marked the return of 5-9
forward Barb Welsh to the Pitt
line-up. Welsh, the East's leader in
free throw percentage, played
intermittently on the remainder of
the road trip. The scoring was well
balanced with Randolph's 15 points
leading the Pantherettes.

Randolph had 21 points and
Senkowski tallied 14 in Friday’s
89-41 laugher at Villanova.

“Actually, that was a much better
game than the score indicated,”
Balthaser pointed out. “It was a
super team effort.”

The long-awaited showdown with
lmmaculata, ranked third in the
country, was not disappointing,
despite.the 81-74 etching in the
Pantherettes’ loss column.

The ﬁrst obstaclewas the Mighty
Macs’ height advantage—three
Immaculata starters measure over
six feet. Pitt quickly managed to get
two of them’ in foul trouble.
Pantherette defense was extremely

Pantherette forward. Barb Welsh returned to the Pitt lineup during the

team’ s recent roadtrip after a layoff due to injury.

hard-nosed and subdued the Macs
until midway through the first ‘half
when forward Kim Raymond fell
and re-injured her knee. Immacu-
lata then got a couple of easy
lay-ups from the loose Pantherette
press and led by ﬁve at the half.

In the second half, the Immacu-
lata fast break domiriatedthe court
and at one point, the Macs were up
by 20 points. Still, Pitt battled back
to within seven. I

Randolph, although well worked
over by 6-4 Mac center Sandy
Miller, was the game’s leading
scorer with 35 points, her’ second
highest total of the season.

“We really played with them,”
Welsh said. “I really felt we could
come back and take over.”

.“Comparing Maryland and Im-
maculata, Immaculata is deﬁnitely

the better team,’ said Senkowski.
“Both ‘are tough under the boards
and very aggressive. But it’s.just _,

.Immaculata’s poise that kills you.

No matter how bad the situation is,
they always keep their heads.”

“It was probably the best game
we've played all season,’ ’ Balthaser
surmised- “We were deﬁnitely in
that game the whole time. And"
even though Wanda played a super

‘ game, everybody put forth great

effort. The injury to Kim in the ﬁrst
half was a big factor, I think,
although freshman Nancy Laback
did a.great job.” .

Tomorrow, the Pantherettes have
a rematch with Edinboro 7 p.m. at
the Field House. The Lady Scots

Maimed Ma tmen to Meet’ Mountaineers  

BY JIM LEWIS

Talk about injuries. You haven't
seen anything until you've had a
look at the -Pitt wrestling team
roster.

Eight starters have been felled by
injuries this season, causing
tonight's match against arch-rival
West Virginia, 7:30 p.m. at the
Field House, to be a toss-up when it
would normably be a cake-walk for
the Panthers.

“Mosteveryone on the team is
wrestling with injuries,” head
coach Dave Adams worried. ‘ ‘Mark
Stepanovich (starting Pitt heavy-
weight) will be out for quite a while
now after suffering a back injury.
We’re hoping everyone will be

Victory, 79-33

BY JIM GEFSKY

Trees Pool was the stage and the
Pitt and Youngstown State swim-
mersvthe actors in a play premiere
Friday. When the ﬁnal curtain fell,
the Panthers had downed the

understudy Penguins, 79-33, win- _

ning 12 of 13 events.

The meet was intended as a
preparation for post season compe-
tition, so different events such as
the 1,650-yard freestyle, the
400-yard freestyle relay, the
400-yard. individual medley, the

‘ 800-yard freestyle relay and cham-

pionship diving were held. Cham-
pionship diving includes 11 dives
(instead of the regular six), and
since Youngst0wn’s divers were
about an hour late, the meet was
considerably longer than usual. For
Pitt, however, the wait Was well
worth the‘time as Tom Fatyol won
the one-meter diving with a score of
512.55.

The co-stars of Pitt’s perfor-
mance were Jerry DeMuro and
Mark Schuman. Schuman won the
100-yard butterﬂy in 51.5 seconds
and set a Pitt record when he took
the 50-yard freestyle with a time of
21.6. DeMuro won the 500-yard
freestyle in 4:41.3 and set a" pool
record with his 15:54.6 mark in the
1,650-yard freestyle. _ ,

The supporting cast’s victories
included Bob Greenwald in the
200-yard freestyle in 1:49.6, Tom
Dowd in the 400-yard individual
medley in 4:32.7, John Schepner in
the 100-yard freestyle with a 47.7
and Bob Clemmer in the 100-yard
breastroke in 1:02.7.

The Panthers also won the
400-yard freestyle relay, anchored
by freshman Tom Sveta in 3:19.24,
and the 800-yard freestyle relay
anchored by DeMuro. Pitt would
have won the 100-yard backstroke
via Neal Wallace had the tankers
not chosen to use it as an exhibition.

‘‘It was a long meet but we had to
qualify people for nationals’ ’ , said a
relaxed assistant coach Fred Lewis.
“Although the length of the meet
might have hurt some performan-
ces, the whole team did very well.
especially DeMuro and Schepner. I
think the meet was a good
preparation for the Eastems."

The Eastern championships,
held at West Virginia March 3-5,
will be the tankers’ next perfor-
mance. The script for the Easterns
is more difficult to act and has an
all-star cast, so the Panthers will
have to be in top form.

7 ready for the (Eastern Wrestling

League) tournament.”

Stepanovich is the newest name
on the injury list, along with such
notables as All-American Rande
Stottlemver ~(134-pound class),
Gregg Soergel (134), Bruce Huggler
(177), Ed Bredniak (142), Bill Bailey
(190), Skip Bolin (167) and Jackie
Kline (118). Bailey and Bolin are
well enough to start tonight, but the
rest—all starters at one time or
another—will not see action.

That’s bad news for Pitt, which
has lost six in a row and dropped to a
sub-par 5-6 record after a fantastic
5-0 headstart and national ranking.

The probable lineup will be a
patched one, with Bill Clark at 118,
Jose Martinez (who’s come on well
of late) at 126, Steve Carter at 134,
Kim Smith at 142, Ken McNamara
at 150, Jim Gordon at 158, Bolin at
167, Don Amdt at 177, Bailey at 190
and Milt Schueler (seeing action for
the first time this year) at
heavyweight.

But if you think that all is lost for
the Panthers, you’re mistaken. The
Mountaineers are in worse shape,
with tons of injuries also and a
horrid 3-15 mark.

“They’re going through the same
things ‘ we’re going through,”
Adams sympathized. “They may

have to forfeit the 118-pound match
and possibly one other weight
class.”

Which would normally be good
news for a wrestling squad; a forfeit
would mean a six-point advantage
from the very beginning, something
Pitt has not seen in 10 of its 11
matches this season. But Adams
fears the West Virginia forfeiture
rather than enjoys it.

“I would like to have that match
held,” Adams explained. “Not
only because our wrestler in that
class (Clark, a freshman) gains
experience, but because he’s one of
the healthier ones on the team.”

Despite all the injury problems,
however, Adams is conﬁdent his
squad will break out of a losing
sickbed where Millersville (22-20),
seventh-ranked Lehigh (41-3), Clar-
ion (35-13), Lock Haven (32-15),
Navy (29-15) and eighth-ranked
Penn State (32-5) have all
successfully operated on the failing
Panthers.

“The caliber of the teams we’ve
played so far is—not belittling West
Virginia—much better than the
caliber of teams they play,” Adams
said conﬁdently. “We should be
prepared. I expect we’ll win the
match.” '

Bolin will put his undefeated status [13-0] on the line against the
struggling West Virginia Mountaineers tonight at the Field House.
