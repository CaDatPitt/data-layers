— With the ﬁnal procedures of the, Rumunerations Board
released and circulated across campus, the Student
Government Board has ﬁled a letter of complaint with
Willard “Bud” Heaps, director of the Office of Student

Activities. The complaint centers around the reinunerationsr
‘ board’s failure to hold any‘public hearings on its new

process for paying student leaders. ’ _ .

_ In the letter, the SGB asked that William Markus, -Vice
Chancellor for Student Affairs, take over the revision of the
remunerations process. p _
 SBG member Dave Hesidence, who wrote, the letter to

Heaps, said the board believes public hearings ‘are _

necessary to make sure all students understand the
remunerations process and to measure students’ opinions
about the payment of student leaders.

“A public hearing has two‘ functions,” explained
Hesidence. “First, it is to get input from the students on
remunerations. I also think a public hearing is important to
make sure there is "an understanding of the process.

Before Carter approved ‘the

assistance program, only ‘students

of families that earned approxima-
tely $13,000 to $14,000 a year were
eligible for basic grants from the

federal government. , Under the old .

eligibility "requirements only. 4,000
students at Pitt received grants.
Dutkovich . said he expected the
number of eligible students to rise
between 7,000 and 8,_000. - ' I

of people are. really disgusted with
PUPC'as a whole, so we. thought
that if_we worked together, some
reasonable end might be reached,’ ’
Mark Holloway, chairman of the

S Black Action Society said.

Holloway, along with" Nello
Giorgetti, chairman of the College
Young Democrats, drafted a three
point proposal calling for the t
institution of major changes inthe
program council’s ﬁnancial and
programming‘ policies. ‘

The first. point of the proposal

calls for the program council to give “

$80,0O0_of its $110,000 allocation

~ back to Student Government Board

for allocation to other student
organizations. '

The second provision of the
proposal asks that the Music
Committee be granted the right'to
promote its own concerts, indepen-
dent of any outside professional
agencies. This part of the proposal
copies an amendment to the

council’s by-laws presented Oct. 26 '

various student organizations,
Medoff’s proposal met strong

opposition from Tammy’ Haddad,-

who chairs the program council.
Haddad argued that the success of
the professionally promoted Chuch
Mangione homecoming concert
should‘ serve as proof that V" a
professionally promoted concert
can work. The following week,
Haddad admitted that the Chuck
Man gione concert was promoted by
the program "council’s Music
Committee, not by any local
promoter. _ p
The final point of the proposal
calls for the total restructuring of
the council. This_process, according
to Holloway,’ would entail a

also include some revision of the

Holloway also squelched rumors
that BAS intends to ﬁle charges of
unconstitutionality against the
council with the SGB Judicial

“This really isn't the truth,”
Haddad said. “The problem is not
that we never offered them these

nroblem was that we could only get

In response to the meeting and
the proposal, Haddad believed that

Holloway and Giorgetti were wrong '

to meet without a representative of

“I cannot understand where

subtracted from its allocations for

could not present any concerts and
lectures as it does now withlthe
$30,000 remaining. —

SGB Letter

(Continued from page 1)

after the SGB.asked the Office of
Student Affairs last fall to convene a

remunerations board to try to solve

some problems in the existing
system for paying SGB members
and other students in various
leadership positions. ‘

The remunerations board began
its work in June, and would not
release any funds for remunerations
until the . remunerations ‘board
completed its work.

However,- the remunerations
board failed to complete new
procedures until the last’ week in
October. Heaps explained that the
long deliberations were necessary _to
ﬁnd remunerations board members",
to acquaint them with the old
remunerations and to design a new
system that was different from the
old one. ‘ ' «

“The board tried to be very
objective and decided it was not
going to reach conclusions others
wanted it to reach,” Heaps said.

Hesidence said the Office of ‘

Student Affairs had taken too long

to convene a remunerations board-

and that the new procedures ‘for
remunerations could have been

ﬁnished much soonerif ithad been

convened before June.

“I could sit down and devise.a
new remunerations board in an houf"
or an hour-and-a-half. If the board

‘ had been convened earlier, it would

have had a new process by July 1.
If the board had been convened

when the SGB asked (in ‘September /
- 1977), we could have had a process

on time,” Hesidence said.

Funds for r'emunerations‘~' that
have been held in escrow since July
were released by the SGB on
Friday._' Student Government
decided that those who had received

received before the convening of the
before the convening of the

“I need your support more than
ever in the most important

be able to appear on next year's
ballot if charter reform loses - and
we all know the alternatives spell
disaster for Philadelphia.”

T hat play on fear, constantly
repeated in Pennsylvania’s largest

city where the black population is
more than one-third, is what
prompts opponents of the contro-
versial. tough-talking Rizzo’ to tag
the former policeman a racist.

The charter change issue has
dominated the Philadelphia election

The board would consider the
complexity of the applicant’s
duties, the impact of his position,
the personal expenses the applicant
must pay and the time demanded by
the applicant’s position. After
evaluating the applicants, the
remunerations board would decide

what applicants deserved re-

Flaherty said he was ‘ ‘opposed to
anyone using racial tactics which
would polarize or divide blacks
against whites” and hoped the
charter issue “will be decided not

along racial or personality lines but '
on the principle it perpetuates too

much power.”

Thomburgh called the Rizzo
rhetoric ‘ ‘racially inﬂammatory and
divisive” and charged that the
mayor “set race against race.”

Rizzo called the gubernatorial
candidates “political hypocrites”
and insisted he wasn't a racist.

“The black man has done better
under. me than all of the liberal
mayors before 'me,” Rizzo said.
“I’m more liberal than most of the

rights.”

PI'I”I‘SBURGH—Allegheny County residents were told to

Relief was in sight, however, following an early morning
temperature inversion that cut visibility through the smoke

Weather Service.’

“There should be a front moving through Monday

Austrians Consider Nuclear Power

VIENNA, Austria—Austrians voted yesterday on
whether their country’s first nuclear power plant should go
into operation, the most hotly debated issue in many years in
this staid and stable nation. The 700-megawatt plant at
Zwentendorf, 28'miles northwest of Vienna, cost $650
million to build and was completed several months ago.

Socialist Chancellor Bruno Kreisky called it essential for

Austria’s economic future. The opponents, riding a wave of
anti-nuclear sentiment in Western Europe and the United
States, said nuclear power is not yet a safe enough energy

alternative.

Furor In -Paris Over Anti- Semitism.

PARIS'—An unrepentant French _Nazi collaborator who
claimed ‘ ‘onl“y lice were gassed at Auschwitz’ ’ has sparked a
national furor over anti-Semitism reminiscent of last
century’s Dreyfus affair. , ,

The remarks were made by 80-year-old Louis Darquier de
Pellepoix, who was commissioner for Jewish affairs in
France’s war-time Vjchy government, in an interview
published Oct. 29 in L’Express magazine.

In the interview, Darquier, who lives in exile in Spain,
said the Jews had plotted to control the world, making
Jerusalem the capital. At one point, he denied that the
Nazis had exterrninated 6 million Jews. ’

_‘‘This figure is an invention, pure and simple—an
inventionof the Jews, of course,” he said. “The Jews are

if Opinion,

Bruce Hall:

A Lack of
   Communication

The strife among 10th- and llth-ﬂoor residents of

Bruce Hall, the University housing office and the _

maintenance staff is a classic example of lack of
communication.

The residents claim their complaints to the housing ‘

office concerning cracks and holes in the walls,
missing bathroom light fixtures, lack of security
during the day, lack of radiator keys and ill-ﬁtting
windows aren’t heard; Don Hughes of the housing
office claims he has received “a few complaints” and
has passed them along to project coordinator George
Simmons; Simmons , admits to some gripes but
claims, “There haven't been too many complaints.”

The vicious circle of bureaucracy finds another vic-
tim: the students in Bruce Hall. Obviously un-

- satisfied with living conditions, for which they pay an

extra $25 a term, these residents try to find a way to
express their dissatisfaction. They’ve had few
results. «

There are two ways to point out problems in the
dorms: (l) maintenance slips and (2) phone calls to
the housing office. Hughes claims that what com-
plaints his office has received are being “relayed. . .to
the contractor (Navarro Corporation) .and...Sim-

mons.”. - -

Simmons acknowledges major complaints brought, j . », _
in front of him-peeling ‘paint, ill-fitting win- '
dows-—-that ‘-the‘ contractor would deal With but"
claims that somerproblems “are the UniVetSitY’__S,

responsibility. ' ’

‘ Whoever is right-‘—.-Hughes, Simmons. or both--is .

not the question. The problem lies in the fact that
these st dents are trying to voice their complaints

and don’t‘ know where to go for each complaint or if

indeed their complaints are being heard. Said one
Bruce Hall resident, “we’ve called the housing office
and sent many maintenance slips but we don’t know
if Mr. Hughes is receiving our complaints.”

The mild buck-passing should stop; it is the job of
the housing office and project office to inform Bruce
Hall residents-’—and all residents, for that mat-
ter—just where to go with a complaint. The main-
tenance slips, for some reason, aren’t working, and
the telephone calls to the housing office aren’t
reaching Hughes or Simmons.

The complaints are real; the students—-"who are the

. “customers” purchasing ehousing at Pitt—are

dissatisfied; the immediate step is to alleviateall con-
fusion and‘ give students the assurance that their
problems are going to be heard by someone.

 

 Nuclear Energy and‘America’s ‘Resource Crisis’

By PAUL KRBINGOLD

Since President Carter's energy
policy. speech of April 1977, the
debate over a competent energy
policy for the United States has
intensiﬁed and must be resolved. At
issue is whether the country- will
pursue a policy of “growth” or a
policy of ‘ ‘zero- growth. ' ’

Edward Teller, father of the
hydrogen bomb, once said, “Every
time I lecture on nuclear energy,
someone in the audience stands up
and asks, ‘Dr. Teller, what if a
nuclear power plant blows up?’ I
reply that before that could happen,
the laws of science and the universe
would have to change resulting in
worse problems than exploding
reactors. For example, gravity
might disappear, the sun might go
out, the earth might stop rotating,
etc. As soon as I've finished
explaining this in detail the original
questioner always stands up and

asks, ‘Yes, Dr. Teller, but what if
they blow up?’ ”

I cite this story because it
demonstrates well the irrationality

of the environmentalist _ mind. ,

Imprisoned in a paranoid and
guilt-ridden world, the “greenie”
will’ repeat programmed phrases
such as “the earth is ﬁnite,”
“technology kills, ” ‘ ‘we must learn
to live moresimply” and so forth.
My purpose here is not to debate
this nonsense directly. Rather it is
to outline the philosophical necess-
ity for growth and progress through
technology. Let me begin with
fundamentals. , .
The difference between man and
the lower species is his creative
mind. More explicitly, only man
can change the method of
reproduction of his species. He
does this on the basis of what Plato
called “hypothesizing the higher
hypothesis.” Man is confronted
with a problem of his existence,
climatic changes and shortage of

food. He thinks-a solution; that is,
he creates new knowledge and new
concepts and applies this know-

, ledge with technology. An animal

faced with the same problem either
migrates, genetically changes or
dies. Man invents technology. As
long as that power of creative
reason is utilized we can be
conﬁdent of our future existence.
As soon as we cast out reason and
"‘make do with less” we are‘
ﬁnished—dead.  . I
As a species, we have faced
“overpopulation” and “resource

crisis” scores of times.in the past.

For example, in response to the
American Revolution’s commit-

ment to industrial growth and‘

population expansion, Parson
Thomas Malthus performed a
service for the British Empire. He
dredged up the philosophy that
declared “population growth is
increasing exponentially, but food
production is increasing only
arithmetically. Therefore, war,

plague and famine are necessary. .
People must die.” The American
West scoffed at Malthus V as the
Great Plains opened up for
agriculture and fed the world.
Furthermore, there is no "such
thing as a “natural” resource-
there are only “man-made" re-
sources. Each technology we invent
deﬁnes a speciﬁc aspect of nature as
a resource. Oil was nothing but an
oddity until petroleum technology
was invented. Uranium was only an
experimental substance until the
Manhattan Project. As we use up
our resources, we develop new
technology that defines new

‘resources. For example, as we run
, out of uranium and oil we can bring

thermonuclear fusion to the fore.
This technology deﬁnes hydrogen
in sea water as a basic energy
resource. Rather than decreasing,
our resource base massively
expands through progress. There is
a lot ‘more hydrogen in" sea water
than there is oil, coal or uraniumin
the ground. -

\ Throughout history, the human
race has created new resources for
the purpose of development.
Development means raising the
material, educational and cultural
standard of living for the world. To
achieve this we introduce technol-
ogy and raise the per capita amount
of production. This creates a
surplus, which we reinvest back into
the individual through educatior
and recreation. With a higher
standard of living, the individual
can use more advanced technolo-
gies that create a greater surplus
and thus greater reinvestment. The
cycle must continue forever.

The environmentalist looks at the
black African with his digging stick
and admires the “noble savage,”
calls the digging stick “appropriate
technology” and organizes to make
sure he never gets fertilizer or a
tractor.

The environmentalist attacks
city-building and declares that only
“decentralized, agrarian-based

communities” are ﬁt for humans.
He does not consider that this type
of fuedal structure cannot afford
-universities, research centers, art '
museums or environmental groups.
There is no ‘ surplus to feed
non-producers in agrarian societies.
This is why the humanists of the
Arab and European Renaissance
built cities.
.As ‘an example of environmental-
ist insanity, take solar energy,
Barry Commoner’s pet technology.
To provide the 10,000 megawatts of
electricity currently needed by New
York City would require 350
kilometers ofland area; one-half of
the total land area of the city. The
cost of the required 160 kilometers
of mirror, 2.5 million tons ‘of steel,
13 million tons of glass and one
million man-years of labor would
result in the price of electricity
being 30 to 40 cents per kilowatt
hour. Compare this with the two
cents per kilowatt hour now charged
for nuclear electricity and you must
realize solar electric power is
between ten and twenty times as
costly as nuclear power!
The following program for energy
growth should be implemented:

—Proceed with-‘ﬁssion research.

—Begin a crash program for

— —Repeal the National Environ-

The Past and Present Problems oPitt Programming.

Ever since the failure to produce
the New Riders of the Purple Sage
homecoming concert years ago,
almost all attempts to produce
concerts at this campus have ended
up either incrediblyiisuccessful or

 dismal failures with the latter in the

majority. This is not‘ to say that
producing ‘a concert is an easy task
but rather it is seemingly too much
for those who have tried. Needless

' to say, even the successful concerts

have no_t been ‘without their
problems (witness the current
controversy over the Chuck
Mangione show).

Perhaps it would be wiser to
continue the practice of selling
cut-rate tickets to major, Civic
Arena or Stanley Theater concerts,
but I have notjseenthe relevant
data which shows that this
approach works.

Almost two years ago, the same
frustrated attitude that I express
here led to my involvement in one
of the ‘many’ facets», of . college

concert "production, the Allocations »

Committee. As liason to, among

others, the old’ _Stude_ntiG9vern-by

ment Concert Committee my job

i was to answer any questions they

had about their budget 'and'help

themllthrough the budgetary...

procedures; I was not there to tell
them how to "produce concerts but I
did_ help out on several of their

A shows- (most notably Stanley

Turrentine and‘Rick Derringer).

America and
the ‘Resource,

Crisis ’

(Continued from page 6) ‘
commitment to hard technology
(coal, oil, nuclear). '

With the onset of a fusion
economy by the year 2025, man will

have solved his energy problem for_

10,000 years. The major problem in
the next century will be the

"colonization of other planets. It is in

theneighboring galaxies that man
will find the bast new resources and
land -area on which "to continue his
growth and solve the problems of the
future. _

WITH A AND A
CHECKUP CHECK
0

AMERICAN CANCER SOClETY

As a committee, we made many
decisions concerning the fate of
numerous concert requests. _ I
watched the Student Government
Board members get upset with the
concert committee and vice versa.
They fought and they argued and
they debated over and over again.

Now we have a brand new Pitt
Union Program Council but the
problems and controversies are still

here. Time, and restructuring sure

doesn’t change much, does it?
Aside from the obvious fact that
trying to produce concerts has been
and ‘will probably always be more
of a headache than it is worth, two
fairly distinct‘ components‘ of the
recent SGB-PUPC-BAS Home-
coming - Black Week concert
controversy (another ﬁasco in
itself) strike me as particularly
alarming. '
In the “real world,” that
_ mysticalmagical place where most
college students‘ go when they
-graduate, contracts like the one
between the; SGB andthe council

A are made every day. Multi-billion

;dollar defense contracts, contracts
for union employees, contracts for
home improvements. The list is

endless. Most ‘of those in thelegal .

community concern themselves.
with, among; other things, the
resolution of__disputes that arise
when one" party ‘fails to uphold
these contracts and the subsequent
restitution to‘the injured party.

They even have their own jargon
for such an occurrence and take
note, Tammy Haddad (council

-chairwoman), they don’t call it a

mistake, they call it breach. Since
intraorganizational reprimands
often lead to deflated egos,

* resentment andvresignations, itis

not likely that the SGB or the Office
of Student Affairs will seek
restitution from the council. In
fact, if anyone deserves‘ restitution
it is the BAS-g—they are the ones
who ended up with no concert’.
The other point I would like to
address concerns Haddad and ‘her
attitude concerning responsibility
for the council as reported in‘The

Pitt News Nov.- 1 issue. First, any‘

and all news that involves the
management and/or allocation of
student activity fee monies and the
council does not belong on page 12
next to the TV listings. It is front
page news no ‘matter how trivial. ’

Pitt News have to print that directly

I relates to" Pitt students. Certainly
not labor union negotiations, Betty

Ford’s face lift, or sadly, the race
for governor that they rip oiff_,»,their.
AP machine "and ‘doctor up,., Face

up to it Haddad, whatevefyiqu. arid A‘

your council do is news,”b‘ig.'news.V'
Since it is your name at tlieitop of ’

the bulletin board outside your

office it really makes me mad that
the ﬁrst ' time the council is
(seemingly) guilty of misrepre-

sentation, you are the first to deny
your responsibility over the actions

of your committees. If you can't‘

stand the heat, stay out of the
kitchen and let each individual
committee chairman justify his
actions and decisions in front of the
SGB. '

Let me add that aside from this
instance of “buck.-passing,” you
and the rest of the council have
been doing quite an admirable job,

- especially with the outdoor cafes.
In’the future, to prevent further
controversies such as the Chuck
_Mangione show, either start
“signing the forms” andtake all
the responsibility oi‘ create such a
complex and intertwined "bureau-
cracy that nobody will have to take
the rap.

One last council-related matter,
while perhaps trivial, still remains

to its searing climax tomorrow, with
underdog Republican Richard L.
Thornburgh churning hard and
Democrat Peter F. Flaherty running
scared.

“Dr. Gallup ,did open-heart
surgery on the Flaherty campaign.
The underdogs have become the
evendogs,” said Thornburgh, cit-
ing from the last independent poll
that showed him only four points
behind. I '

“I’m much more comfortable in a

own campaign gaffes helped close

the gap despite a Democratic.

registration edge of nearly 900,000.
The 46-year-old Thornburgh, a
former federal prosecutor,
scratched and clawed his way back
into the race. The maverick
Flaherty had a perfect platform
based on his seven-plus years as
mayor of Pittsburgh—tight spend-
ing, rolled back taxes and a
scandal-free administration.

But Thornburgh mounted. .a;

timely blitz in the last month,
hoping to gut Flaherty’s image and
pledging to deliver the state,from
the corruption that grieves outgoing
Democratic Gov. Milton Shapp.
The race hinges on how large a
majority Flaherty wins in Philadel-

phia, where Democrats outnumber ~

Republicans by 7-to-2.’ But the
gubernatorial race is overshadowed
by the ambitions of Mayor Frank
Rizzo, trying to change the city
charter so he can seek a third term.

The yes-no vote on the Rizzo

question assures a large turnout. . ’
’ But

Flaherty, who like his
Republican opponent is opposed to
the change, has’ incurred Rizzo’s
wrath and has irked the Democratic
machine. .

Thornburgh hopes that the
margin won’t go over 150,000 and
that he can offset it with a strong
showing in the heavily Republican
suburbs.

decisions to make in addition to who
will be their 42nd governor.

All  congressional seats, of
which 18 are held by Democrats, are
up for grabs. The most
controversial involve Rep. Daniel
Flood and Rep. Joshua Eilberg.
Both Democrats are under indicts
ment for wrongdoing.

On the state level, all 203 state
House seats and half of the 50 state
Senate seats are up for grabs,
though the Democrats are expected
to keep control of both. The
legislative candidates must answer
to voters on dragging their feet on
ethics reform, haggling over budget
matters and why four_ of their
Democratic colleagues are now in
jail for betraying the public trust.

The gubernatorial race ﬁnally
exploded four weeks ago. Until

then, the two Pittsburgh lawyers
who are old acquaintances took
amazinglysimilar stands on issues.

They’re only major disagreement
was who should be the next

\

governor. Then Thornburgh
attacked.

Thornburgh has put a big
question mark in voters’ minds by
pointing out that Mayor-elect
Flaherty voted to increase Pitts-
burgh’s.taxes. Though he reduced
the burden in ensuing years, the
taxes are still higher than they were
after that ‘1969 vote. And city
services suffered.

“It was the only game in town. I
was getting killed in what were
normally Republican areas,” said
Thornburgh, seeing Flaherty’s
appeal soar because of his ﬁscal
conservatism. ,

What followed has been a series
of charge and countercharge, with
Thornburgh saying aples and
Flaherty replying with oranges. It’s
been a million dollar version of a
schoolyard argument called “yes I
did—no you didn’t.”

In this war of semantics,
Thornburgh launched an expensive
media campaign,

steel mills and the region’s coal
mines.

The work is not glamorous but
the lure is apparent.

“I’Il tell you why I’m here,”
answers Barbara Haugh, a petite
25, during lunchbreak at Allegheny
Ludlum’s Brackenridge steel mill.
“My husband and I separated in
April. I have three kids and I
needed money fast.”

As an unskilled laborer, Haugh.
can In:-kc as much as $14,000 a year .

- almost double what she took in as
a courthouse secretary.

“When I’m .down in the hole-

shoveling, I’ve saidtolmyself, ‘Oh,
my God, what am I doinghere?’ At
times, I’ve had to bit my lip to keep
from crying. Sometimes payday is
the only thing that gets me
through . .. ‘ ‘Whenever somebody
says, ‘You're taking a jobaway
from a family man,’ I say: ‘Hey,
I1o\\' am I any different?’ " g '
Money isn’t the only appeal.
“I wouldn’t have missed this
experience for the world,” says
Denise Winebrenner, 27, single,
and a trained teacher, of her two
years at ‘U.S. Steel's Edgar
Thomson Works in Braddock.‘
“I’ve learned a lot about men,
how to work with my hands, and
I’ve gained a lot of respect for what
gum’ ‘"1 in a mill.” : 4
. Working ‘her way into a skilled

' craft job, Winebrenn has two years
' ‘to go as an apprentice millwright.

She calls the job, maintaining and
repairing mill machinery, “top-rate
in all respects” and a satisfying
challenge. a ' '
‘She considers the question of
physical capabilities’ -' a common
argument against women in heavy
industry -= to be a phony ‘issue.
“There are some jobs’ I can’t do

vsonneL

and some I can do better because
I'm small. Besides, this is the 20th
century. There are enough ‘cranes
and forklifts for the heavy work.”
‘Women make up 40 percent of
the'American workforce,’ 43 per-
cent of all working women support
themselves and an additional 23
percent are married to men who
make less than $10,000 a year.
- ,Yet far our of proportion to their
members and needs, women
remain concentrated in low-paying
“women's” jobs. For instance,
women make up 90 percent of bank
tellers. '

Only_ in the mid-1970s were sex
bias standards applied with any
vigor. Responding to
antidiscrimination lawsuits, the
federal government ’zeroed in on
the steel industry. In 1974, nine
steel companies, along. with the

‘United Steelworkers union, entered

into a consent _decree, setting goals
for the hiring andﬁadvancement of
women andblacks.

The biggest company,- U.S.
Steel, says its blue-collar workforce
is 10 percent female - more than
double the ﬁgure before the
consent decress.

“Even ‘though- we’ve had a
shrinking work force, our per-
centages of women and blacks have
gone up,” says’ Donald H.
Hoffman, vice president for per-
“Inudstry is playing
catch-up and equity dictates it.”_

The wave of layoffs in the steel.

industry has dampened enthusiasm
about percentages for some
women’s groups. “There are fewer
and fewerjobs at a. time when
women are just getting into
good-paying j‘obs,” says Litz
Hr'enda of the Pennsylvania

omen Emerge Workers in Local Steel Industry

chapter of the Coalition of Labor
Union Women.

initial treatment of blacks in the
mills and that of women.

They put on the hottest, dirtiest,
most dangerous jobs and hope you
fail or quit,” says Jones, an official
with the steelworker’s local at U.S.
Steel’s Edgar Thomson Works._
“There’s really the same type of
psychological warfare going on."

The movement ‘of women into
craft jobs has been slow, and into
supervisory positions even sIower..

“They feel it’s OK if women
keep their place and do janitor jobs
that are more or less like house
cleaning,” says Joann Kielur, a
4-year veteran of Jones &
Laughlin’s Pittsburgh Works. “But
try taking over theskilled positions
and you get a little moreﬂak.”

If you saw Aerosmith’s perfor-

Escaping Critics’ Categories

By M. PATRICK MONAHAN
e Pitt News Staff Writer
To be sure, Aerosmith is one fine act in concert; and in person, at a
press party hosted by‘ Columbia Records prior‘ to the band’s Arena

performance, it met the Pittsburgh media and was surprisingly down to ’
earth’, V . .

Guitarist ‘Brad Whitford stopped to_ talk and was personable and ‘
T levelheaded when asked about Aerosmith’s recent media-grabbing role

, .

in p“Sgt. Pepper’s” and the band’s image.

.“We’re not ashamed of our role in f‘Sgt. Pepper's,” because we
believewe came offlooking betterthan just about anybody in the film, ”
said Whitford. ‘ _ ' . C .

“The role of the future villains was something we were comfortable
with, and it was closer to our actual image and music than were Peter

Frampton’s and the Bee Gees’, who did look- pretty silly at times,” he‘

said. ‘ . A
Whitford said Aerosmith‘ is escaping 'a category into which critics
formerly lumped it—-1970’s clones of the Rolling Stones. He said the
band ﬁnally is being recognized for its uniqueness. , . ’ '
“We used to read all this crap about how we were just imitating the
Stones in concert because Steve (Tyler) and Joe (Perry) look_a lot like

. Mick Jagger and Keith Richards. However, this/never has bothered the

way we have approached our music and act for the last 10 years,” he
said‘. ' ' ‘-
‘_‘To'be sure, our roots are heavily evolved from the great British
groups like the Stones and Led_Zeppelin, but that’s just the things we
were weaned on musically,” he added. ‘.‘We’ve never tried to mimic our
act off of some successful groupof the past. That would be stupid.”
Whitford continued, “We’ve had ‘five platinum albums and great
success touring; and it’s about time people start recognizing us for these
accomplishments.” —~
Whitford. also mentioned how Aerosmith went about winning
popularity when it first was starting ‘out. ’ A I

“Critics can say whatever. they want about you and it can hurt, _

because people will read it and believe it,” he said. “In our case, when
we were ﬁrst starting .out we never received "hype or praise from the

‘ press. _

“We became headliners after we started opening shows for bands we

' knew we could blow off the stage,” he said. “We became headliners
' when promoters started realizing no band could follow us..

“We’ve been- together as a band almost 10 years now with the same
lineup’ "said Whitford. “We’ve approached all our projects with a very
self-contained outlook in that we’ve always believed in ourselves and our
music, which is unquestionably the most important thing a musician can
acquire when approaching his craft.” a ' '

  

However, last Thursday night
before a capacity-filled Civic Arena,
Aerosmith brought its high-

’ provided an exciting, exhiliarating

‘powered rock to Pittsburgh and-

evening of rock ’n roll, something.

the group has beendoing for years.

Onstage, Aerosmith wasias tight
and two-fisted as ever, pulling no
punches and staying away from
gimmicky frills. ,

The band—sensuous; and gruff-
‘voiced vocalist Steve Tyler, frail Joe
Perry‘ and Brad-.Whitford, bassist
Tom Hamilton and drummer Joey
Kramer,.—pounded and sweat their
way through a two-hour set
consisting of the cream of their
zesty and highlycrafted hard-rock
tunes.

Director Kathleen George, doing
her first Shakespearean play, has
done the comedy straight, declining
to do any of the sundry interpreta-
tions given to it in the past._
“Everything is there in the play,”

‘she explained at a cast party after

Saturday night’s performance.
“My touch is Shakespeare's

touch.”
\

It is a great touch at that.

“Much Ado About Nothing” is.

witty and humorous. It is also, in
parts, dark and tragic. Shakespeare
is like that and so is life. This is a
very real play. ,

Set in Messina, the play concerns
the fate of two- pairs V of lovers;
Claudio and Hero, and Benedick

and‘Beatrice. The former couple '

_ are tender romantics. The latter are

biting wits. During the play’s three
acts they struggle through a series
of humorous, though often tragic,
manipulations brought on by
friends and relations. In the end,
however, Cupid triumphs.

Lisa Bansavage is Beatrice. Her
wit becomes manifest in the play’s
first scene as she spars with a
messenger, and it continues
through the entire performance. It
is matched only by Benedick’s. He

Pitt News Staff Writer

' Joe Louis; a.k.a. the Michigan
. Mauler, the Sepia Socker, the

_ Brown Bomber. He was" heavy

weight boxing ‘champ from 1937 to
1949; the ﬁrst black man to hold the
title since‘ Jack Johnson. He
became a “credit to his race,” but
' was nearly destroyed in the
process. Louis reveals everything
in his savagely honest auto-

biography entitled “Joe Louis: My '

Story.” (cowritten with Edna ‘and
,Art Rust, Jr.).

Surprisingly literate to most
readers because Louis’ public
image has been that of the
archetypal punch-drunk, illiterate
ﬁghter. There are many intelligent,
thoughtful insights.

The book reads like an intimate

conversation, energized by per-
sonal, earthy language. Louis
details his Alabama boyhod, his
father's insanity and his family’s
move to Depression-ridden Detroit.
There, the teenage Louis found his
only‘ way out of the squalor was
with his fists. Much space is given
to the big. points of his career.
Louis’ descriptions of his fights are
equal to any sportswriter’s. The
action springs from the pages with
every punch.

Besides the career highlights,
Louis discusses his affairs with
many ‘of the era’s glamour girls
ranging ‘from Lena ‘Home to Lana
Turner‘. His black managers kept
his white women under wraps; they
remembered that Jack Johnson's‘
downfall came about because he’d
ﬂaunted his interracial exploits.

Most of the book's second half
concerns Louis’ tragic post-World
War II life. He pulls no ‘punches
describing his business failures,
tax problems (at one ‘time the IRS
demanded $1 million in back taxes)
his alcoholism and ‘drug addiction.

Louis took no dives in the ring
and he takes none in his

autobiography. Skeptics could ar-
gue that the Rusts polished a lot of-
the prose, but Louis’ humanity and
strength surges through.

For the college generation, this

TBoxer's Autobiography With No Punches Pulled

book is a good introduction to al {,3

‘man and a time virtually unknown

to them. For anyone who re-

members Louis in his prime, the
book will probably surprise, even
shock them, but will certainly bring
back memories. '

Orangemen sing the Blues,   1 1 7 .

'ByMARKMURPHY
' Pitt News Staff Writer
' SYRACUSE, N.Y.—You could
almost hear song in the air
Saturday.
Frank Maloney, the loser, should
have been singing, "‘Won’t you

1 come home, Bill Hurley?/Won’t

you come home?/I moaned the
whole night long.”

Jackie Sherrill, the winner, could
have been crooning,- “Pack up all
your cares and ‘woes/ Here I go
singing low/Bye, bye, bowl bid.”

With wins like the 18-17 squeaker
over Syracuse, Pitt doesn't need.
losses. ‘ ' -

The ‘Panthers, now 6-2, required
11 _points in the fourth quarter,
including Mark Schubert’s 28-yard
field goal with 3:09 left, to defeat a
not-so-good Syracuse team. The
shaky victory over a team with a 1-7
record and playing without its best
player (Hurley), does nothing to
increase the Panthers’ already slim
chances of making their fourth

. consecutive bowl appearance.

“We had to have one like that,”
said Sherrill. “I was pleased with
the way our players came back.

“At' halftime they were low‘
emotionally,” .Sherri1l continued.
“I felt if dach man.’ did his job well
and played every play, we could
win.”,

“We were really ready to play,”
said Syracuse coach Maloney.
“This loss really ripped up my guts.
Ireally don’t know how it is going to
affect our team.” ,

Maloney had his team conduct
pregame practice at a field other
than Archbold Stadium. He ex-
plained he didn’t want his players
thinking about the Panthers and
being “awed” by them. The
strategy appeared successful, as
the Orangemen, aidedby three Pitt
penalties, marched nearly the
length of the field on the game's
ﬁrst series. '

Syracuse made its initial ﬁrst
down when Panther safety Mike
Balzer hit Paul Zambuto out of
bounds after an overthrown pass,
and the ball moved to the Orange
39._ Three downs later the hosts

' faced afourth-and-one, but Pitt was
tagged for an illegal procedure

/ penalty and the drive continued.

A statue of liberty with impres-
sive freshman Joe Morris carrying
the ball gained 16 yards to the Pitt

By The Associated Press

Terry Bradshaw's 24-yard touch-
down pass to Rocky Bleier with 1:51
to play rallied - the Pittsburgh
Steelers to a 20-14 victory over the
New Orleans Saints yesterday in a
National Football League game.

Heath was called for roughing the
kicker, and, as the quarter
approached the halfway, point,

Syracuse still had the ball. Four.

plays later Jacobs made. a
37-yarder, and it was 3-0.

Gary Anderson, a South African
transfer student; booted the ball out
of bounds three times on the
ensuing kickoff, and the Panthers
took advantage of his ineptitude to
get good ﬁeld position at the Orange
43. With Rick Trocano keeping the

offense on the ground, the Panthers V

marched the 57 yards for ,a

touchdown. During the drive Fred A

Jacobs ran 10 yards on the option
(when was -the last time that
happened?) and picked up 20 more
yards, including the 5-yard scoring
rush. 'Schubert’s \PAT made. the
score‘ 7-3—at the end of the ﬁrst
quarter.

Neither offense’did much until 1
late in the second period, when

Syracuse scored to take the lead.
Starting at their own 31, the
Orangemen ran right through the
Panther defense. Morris, who could
be the next of the great Syracuse
backs, gained 61 of his 149 yards on
the drive, but it was Ken
Mandeville who scored from the 1
with 35 seconds left to give the
Orangemen their 10-7 intermission
edge. '  V

“They did a good job running UP
the middle against our freshmen,
Yogi Jones and Jim Covert,” said
Sherrill. “They did an excellent job
picking out the soft spot and staying
with it.”

Syracuse kept right on running at ‘
Jones and Covert in the second half, I

as it scored on its first possession to

grab a 17-7 lead. The big play was a .

41-yard bomb from Wilson to Tony
Sidor, who beat Heath to the poorly
thrown ball. Mandeville again

scored from the 1 to cap the drive. V
Late in the third quarter Pitt’

began its comeback bid. Going to
the air as well as staying on the
ground, Trocano took the Panthers
76 yards in 12 plays. Jacobs carried
for 14 yards, and then Trocano hit
Gordon Jones for 14 more. Two
passes to the offensively reborn

' Steve Gaustad netted 32 yards and

moved the ball to the Orange 13.
Freshman Russell Carter carried to

season-high 84 yards, caught a ﬂair
pass from Bradshaw and ran the
ﬁnal 20 yards with a key block from
wide receiver John/Stallworth for
the touchdown that raised Pitts-
burgh’s record to 9-1, tops in the
NFL.

14-15 lead 1:28 into the ﬁnal period
on a 5-yard touchdown run by Tony
Galbreath. The score was set up by
the slick passing of Archie

for 344 yards, more than double the

average per game allowed by
Pittsburgh. ' .

The Steelers’ winning touchdown
drive, which covered 67 yards in
seven plays, offset a missed 31-yard
ﬁeld goal by Roy Gerela with 10:43
to play. .

Gerela’s 27-yard ﬁeld goal gave
the Steelers a 3-0 lead in the ﬁrst
quarter.

.On their ﬁrst drive of the second
period, the Saints marched 70 yards
for a touchdown that came on
Manning’s 5-yard toss to Chuck

Young Panthers Still One Year A way from   Real Greatness

‘SYRACUSE, N.Y.—After Saturday’s 18-17 Pitt
win_ here, offensive coordinator Don Boyce was
speaking about the Panthers’ offensive problems this
season. After talk of differing formations and
debilitating injuries, Boyce came to the heart of the
matter. ’

“We’re not awesome out there,” the pipe-smoking
coach said.

No, Pitt isn’t awesome anymore, and nowhere was
that point proved better than Archbold Stadium.
Fans spoiled by the success and the individual great-
ness of the last five years have been critical of this
year’s edition of the Panthers. But with each week it

— is becoming more obvious that l978_ is a transitional

year for Pitt, and considering that, its 6-2 record is
not too bad.
The Panthers are young, and it does not take too

much acumen to realize that talented ‘freshmen and‘

sophomores usually make very -‘talented upper-
classmen. But many are unwilling to wait, and so the
excitement of a 4-0 start and a Top 10 national
ranking only has fueled and inspired criticism today.
Let’s face facts: Pitt is not as good as many of us,
maybe even its coaches, thought. Close games again-
‘st poor teams with glaring weaknesses have been too
frequent for any other conclusion to be drawn.
During their eight games, the Panthers have out-
scored their opponents only 149-116. Their highest

point output has been 32 against an. awful Boston’

College team. Nine points is all that separates the
19th-ranked team in America _from a 3-5 record.

If the games are briefly examined on an individual
basis,’ the same answers appear.

After an easy, but by no means impressive, win
over Tulane, Pitt struggled to beat Temple and had

a Full Count  

By MARK MURPHY

to come from behind,to do it. Again, the next week,
the Panthers, carried on the arm of Rick Trocano,
rallied in the fourth quarter to beat a North Carolina
team struggling with a new offense and a new coach.

After the Boston College win, the total brakdown
at Notre Dame occurred. That loss took more out of
Pitt than even some of the players might realize or be
willing to admit. The team just hasn’t been the same
since that 19-point Fighting Irish fourth quarter.
Then came the narrow win over Florida State, a team
that was hurt and the week before had allowed 55
points, and nearly 600 total yards. The defense was
excellent, the offenseinconsistent. .

Two weeks ago the Panthers were embarrassed by
a very good Navy team. The defense was solid, but

' the offense was worse than inconsistent; it was half

dead. Against‘ the best defense statistically in
America, the Panthers rushed for minus 28 yards and
were just plain whipped.

Saturday a last-quarter rally beat a one-win, Bill
Hurley-less Syracuse team. With Hurley leading the
Orangemen, the score might have been 31-18. Most
teams have had field days passing against Syracuse,
but Pitt stayed mostly on the ground.

“We wanted to run inside against them and we
did,” said Jackie Sherrill. “We were a hair‘away

from breaking it. We just couldn’t get the middle ~’

linebacker blocked.

“They’re a lot better team than their record (would
indicate),” Sherrill said later. “They just whipped
our butts at the line of scrimmage.”

That Syracuse is better than their record shows is
very arguable. That Pitt got whipped at the line of
scrimmage is undeniable. The Orange ran much of
the day at freshmen lineman Yogi Jones and Jim
‘Covert and was successful. But both players will
learn and be better prepared the next time. A young
team with great potential learns and becomes a very
good or even excellent team. Pitt is a young team
with great potential.

How young? Its normal offensive starting lineup

has four juniors and three sophomores. Its defensive

unit contains four sophomores and two juniors.
Most important, its quarterback, Trocano, is a
sophomore. As quarterback he must bear a good
deal of the -heat and deal daily with unfair criticism of
himself and the offense.

But Trocano, too, is improving every week. His
statistics might fluctuate, but his eye for reading
defenses and picking up keys is getting better. As a
result, the offense will get better.’ ;

‘‘Trocano was coming off the field and his eyes
would light up. He could see what was going on,”
Boyce said of his quarterback, who was badly con-
fused by. Navy’s defense.

It is now apparent that Pitt might not, ‘indeed
probably won’t, go_to a bowl this year. ‘Sherrill,
Boyce and the rest of the coaching staff know what
this team needs. Again, Boyce puts it succinctly-

‘‘It’s just a matter of us getting some age.”

An 8-3 mark fora team rebuilding and in a tran-
sitional phase would be a pretty damn good record.

JFK r... Draws Swarm toscheniey

BVMARIASCIULDO
Pitt News Staff Writer

Schenley Park was swarming
with runners of all ages, shapes and
sizes yesterday morning as hund-
reds participated in this year’s John
F. Kennedy Memorial run, sponsor-

ed by the West Penn Track Club.
A multitude of concerned par-
ents, friends and coaches plus a
wide variety of canine spectators
crowded the rim of Schenley’s
Flagstaff Hill in order to view the six_
races, ranging from 13-and-under
boys and girls to the 40-and-over
master men’s competition. Little_
ids whose identiﬁcation numbers

' hung from tee-shirt collars like bibs

.and graying housewives were 'both

given the ‘opportunity to fancy ‘

themselves Bill Rodgers or Miki
Gorman as pack after pack of
panting athletes wound their way
through the park.

Pitt sophomore Mike Frank, a
self-proclaimed “casual runner,”
said the key to his preparation for
this race was breakfast. ‘ ‘I think half
a candy barshould do it,”he'said,'
then added, “You know, this is my
first race ever and will probably be
-my last too. Actually, I’m doing it
for Mom.”

One matronly participant smiled,

rats she walked up the final hill and

said. “I’m waiting ‘til I get to the
downhill and hope the momentum
carries me the rest of the way.”

There were, of course, many who
took the race quite seriously,
particularly in the men's open
division, where 310 runners comp-
eted over 3.2 miles. Here, the
coaches ended up showing their
athletes a thing or_ two about
running. I

Duquesne coach and former Pitt
harrier Dave McDonald won the
event in 16:15, with Pitt coaches
Barry Harwick and Mel Boyd

placing second and third. Panther
Gary Siriano was the first collegiate
athlete across the ﬁnish line, taking
fourth place in 16:35. Next for Pitt
was Mark Studnicki (17:14), 12th:

Randy Bailey (17:17), 13th: Bob Lee
(17:34), 16th: Bob Landstrom

(17:37), 18th: Steve Moore (17:48), .

19th, and Dan Datillo (17:56) 20th.
Pitt won the division team title
with 48_ points, followed by the
Human Energy Track Club.
Bailey, who finished well despite
losing his footing midway through
the race and falling, commented the

strategy for‘ this distance (5,
normally used in collegiate races for
10 kilometers. _
“In a faster race, hills are so

-much more important. Normally,

you don't try to burn up the hills
when you know you still have ﬁve

' more miles to run, but today you

had‘ to or you'd have gotten left
behind.” f

“Our kids enjoyed running on
their home course,” said coach
Mike Agostinella. ‘ ‘It was more of a

Depending on ‘its success- at

dual meet this year, last week's win ‘V
over Kent State. Again Siriano led ’ . ’

Mark Nigh Scores Twice as Booters Romp  

By ANNA ARLOITA
‘ Pitt News Staffwriter

Pitt’s soccer team recorded an
impressive 4-0 win over Indiana
(Pa. ) Friday night at ‘Pitt Stadium.

The win boosts the Panthers to
within one game of the .500*(6-7). A
victory against West Virginia
Wednesday night in their lone
remaining gamewill give Panthers
the same" record as last year.

Pitt’s Jeff Tissue scored ﬁrst,ias
he notched his fourth goal of. the
season after 22 minutes had
elapsed. The goal came after
Indiana goalie Akrow Adie-Ikor
made a greatsave on-a Karl Nigh
shot. Tissue came in from the left

side and booted the deﬂected shot
by Adie-Ikor. "

The Panthersgmade the score 2-0
15 minutes later. Mark Nigh took a
Tissue pass at midﬁeld and raced
downﬁeld, then beat Adie-Ikor to
give Pitt its halftime edge.

The ﬁrst half had fast-‘moving
action, and Pitt was ‘very offense-
minded in contrast to the Panthers’
play in last week's 2-1 loss to Lock-
Haven.‘ "

“We were deﬁnitely a much
more aggressive team on offense in
this game,” said Panther Tim
Pearson. “We had 12 good shots

on goal, and two scores‘ came from 7

them. This kind of play) bv the

offense diminished added’ pressure
on the defense and~-makes for
much better game.” -

Pitt’s third goal came 10 minutes
into the second half when the Nigh
brothers combined for the third
time this year. Karl dribbled the
ball toward the goal before passing
to Mark who beat the goalie for the
score. . . '

Mark Nigh was outstanding
Friday, as he played‘ﬁne defense
and scored two goals. His four
goals and ﬁve assists on the season
is rare offense for a fullback.

Craig Connolly netted the
Panthers’ ﬁnal goal of the night

when he took a passfrom Stevie 
pa Harrison, dribbled downﬁeld and  "
scored his fourth goal of the ,

SCZISOXI. ,

I Not only’ did the/ partners 

outshoot Indiana, 20-12, they also

played well defensively and took a :_
great amount of pressure off goalie ‘V .

Scott Thunberg.. *

.“The offense was able to’ havepfgj ‘
much more control of _ the entire 
game,” said Thunberg. “They shot _
._well,_ controlled the ball and above 
all scored. This allowed the defense; -1 '
_ to work hard as a_ unit, although. ‘ q
Nigh, the fullback, did score two of 

the four goals. ”
