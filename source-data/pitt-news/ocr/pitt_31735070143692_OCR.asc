A University-owned laptop containing the

the College of Business Administration was
stolen last month, according to a letter sent to
CBA alumni. ‘ _ . a A

The laptop, which was password-protect-

numbers and demographic information for
CBA graduates from 1998 to 2006.‘

The data was used to assist in career place-

letter, which was signed by John T. Delaney,
dean of the Joseph M. Katz Graduate School
of Business.

The laptop was stolen from an employee’s_

Austin Ransom has spent most
‘ of his career at»Pitt as a special
teams standout. That was ﬁne by
him -— he’d do anything to help
the team win. '
Butiwhen Pitt was faced with
a void at linebacker heading into
' the season, Ransom was afforded

the opportunity to help the team
win in a heightened role.

Since arriving at Pitt in 2004

as a walk—on, Ransom —— now a

senior — has worn many hats for
the football program.

He’s been an asset on the

. scout team, preparing the start-

ers for the week’s opponent. His

hard work on the scout ‘team ‘

led to an opportunity on special
teams, where Ransom excelled
and last year was named special
teams captain by his teammates.
He’s bounced’ around on both
sides of the ball to help’ coaching
staff even out the depth chart.
Now, Ransom has found a home
as Pitt’s interim starting weak side
linebacker. ,

“It’s been a long journey since
I came here ﬁve years ago,” said
Ransom, “What I’m doing now is
adream that I’ve always had, and
I’m glad I’ve ﬁnally fulﬁlled it.
' “I think that coaches noticed
myrhard work. I was always on
scout team trying to giveaas much
effort as I could to make the’de-
fense better. I think it ﬁnally paid
of .” .

Pitt’se defense garnered lofty
expectations for the 2008 season

"after it ﬁnished last season ranked

-ﬁfth nationally. _
The defense returned nine of
11 starters, all three at lineback-
er, including the nations leading
tackler from a year ago, senior
linebacker Scott McKillop.i The
linebacking corps was primed’ for
a big year, anchoring a defense

Blue skies have graced Pitt’s
campus for most of the first
two weeks of this fall semes—
ter. Students don’t see smog
and soot everywhere, and ever
since the Cathedral of Learn;

students... probably forget that
Pittsburgh used to be dirty.
But appearances can be de-
ceiving, and Pittsburgh’s still
polluted. . _
Allegheny County began the

process of attacking and con?‘

quering the pollution problems
that face its citizens by assem-
bling a task force to address the
issue. Theioffice of Allegheny

Rendell in June. The act will ban smoking
in most public buildings and workplaces
throughout the state, excluding bars or
taverns that makes fewer than 20 percent
of their total sales from food. '

With the exception of Philadelphia, as

the act stands now‘, no local governments
may pass further legislation. y

Frankel and-Wagner held yesterday’s
press conference with hopes of making
the ban strictef in Allegheny County.

“Communities like Allegheny County,-
Scranton and‘ other local governments
deserve the freedom to enact ordinances
that respond to the demands of the peo-
ple and actually shield all workers from
the dangers of secondhand smoke," said
Frankel.

In order to amend the Clean Indoor
Air Act, \X/agner’s legislation would al-

low Allegheny County a 90-day period to
establish a stronger smoking ban. If the
county is not satisﬁed with the amend-
ments after 90 days, the original act will
take effect. ~ A

Wagner said she wishes to create a
level playing field for all businesses with
her legislation. Instead’ of penalizing
some businesses for making more than
20 percent of sales in food, she said she
believes that all workplaces should fol-
low the same rules.

Frankel’s legislation would give local
governments the same power that Phila-

delphia was given in regard to the Clean
Indoor Air Act. A

The city is exempt from the conﬁne-
ments of the Clean Indoor Air Act be-

cause Philadelphia had enacted smoke-

free laws two years ago.

 freshman Katie Capri made her
decision on which college to’ attend,
she marginally considered that Pitt was
ranked 59, and more recently 58, on the
U.S. News & World Report national col-
lege rankings.

“Ranking is not the key requisite for
choosing a college,” said Capri, “but
you don’t want to go to an unknown
school.”

Her reluctance to rely on rankings

The Pitt News 0 www.pittnews.com

reﬂects the current national controversy
surrounding the rankings system and its
inﬂuence on the college admissions pro-
cess. .
More colleges than ever refused to
return the survey functioning as‘ the sin-
gle largest part of the formula used by
U.S. News to assemble the annual list
of “America’s‘ Best Colleges.” This year,
46 percent of colleges completed the
peer survey, in which college presidents
rate similar institutions. Nevertheless, it
makes up 25 percent of the magazine’s
formula and is weighted more heavily

than the statistics gathered on such fac-
tors as graduation rates, faculty and re-
sources.

The all-time low of 46 percent is
down from 51 percent last year, 58 per-
cent the year before that and 67 percent a
few years prior. The drop this year — to
44 from 55 percent — was most severe
for liberal arts colleges, the sector from
which much of the ratings’ opposition is
generated.

Robert Morse, the director of data
research for U.S. News, said that the par-
ticipation rate in the national university

category, which includes Pitt, has hardly
fallen, from 63 percent in 2007 to 56 per-
cent this year.

“A 56 percent response rate is still
considered high for a survey conducted
by mail,” he said.

Morse cited “survey fatigue” and cam-
pus concerns, such as the Higher Edu-
cation Act, which has instituted more
stringent guidelines for the student loan
industry, as factors affecting the plummet
in participation.

On the other hand, Lloyd Thacker,
founder of the Education Conservancy,
is “pleased” to see fewer colleges partici-
pating in the magazine’s rankings.

The Education Conservancy is a self-
described non—prof1t founded in 2004
and committed to improving the col-
lege admissions process for students, the
group’s Web site says.

dermining educational value and distort-
ing the way education is perceived and
pursued,” he said.

So far, 67 collegeshave signed a letter
circulated by the Education Conservancy
vowing not to complete the peer survey.

Since 2005, Yale University, ranked
third by US. News, has not participated
in the peer survey, although it would not
rule out partaking in it in the future. . In
the past few years, however, Yale has pub-
licly aligned itself with the anti—rankings
movement led by the Education Conser-
vancy.

Last September, Yale hosted a confer-
ence "sponsored by the nonprofit orga-
nization to encourage leaders in higher
education to discuss alternatives to the
rankings system. The Christian A. John-
son Endeavor donated $300,000 to make

The EPA will decide by the end of

site, which will be unveiled as a prototype
on Sept. 25, will match prospective stu-
dents and colleges and provide a forum
for prospective students to communicate
with current students.

“There is a hunger for educational au-
thenticity, and there is willingness among
colleges [to provide it] ,” said Thacker.
“We aim to match need with willingness.”

According to spokesman John Fedele,
Pitt is committed to continuing to im-
prove its quality —— not only by U.S. News
standards —— but also in all areas contrib-
uting to provide students with the highest
quality education.

Pitt maintained its ranking of 20
among national public universities on this
year’s list.

Fedele added that from last year to this
year, Pitt made improvements in freshmen
retention and graduation rates and per-
centage of incoming freshmen who were
in the top 10 percent of their graduating
classes — from 43 to 48 percent. Also, the
mid-50 percent SAT range rose 20 points,
from 1130-1320 to 1150-1340.

“It must be emphasized that the meth-
odology U.S. News utilizes, which is heav-
ily ﬁnancial, skews the rankings toward
the expensive, private institutions,” wrote
Fedele in an e-mail. “To be 20 among
public universities is a very signiﬁcant
accomplishment, one that the University
has worked hard to achieve.”

nation was in an uproar.
Now, the same ‘government is

.i in a similar position with a lower-

proﬁle disaster that has raised
little controversy.1Why would a
government that delayed relief
during Katrina rush to help this

time around?
As if that weren’t enough,
there is the issue that the city’s

levees barely held. ~ According
to some ofﬁcials, if Gustav had
been a direct hit, the results may

have differed.

With the levees even in ques— ,

tion after a Category 2 storm not
directly hitting the city, how could
the city’s safety be assured in an-
other Katrina?

But with the popular belief
that the levees are sufﬁcient, will
enough be done to prevent an-
other disaster for New Orleans?
Many headlines are portraying the
city’s preparation as a complete
success. The number of evacuees

during Gustav dwarfed the Ka-
trina numbers. Many residents are
attempting to return already with
businesses eagerly waiting.

New Orleans believes that it
is ready to return to normal. Its
walls passed the test of Gustav.
Will the city and its residents start
to believe that the changes made
after Katrina safeguarded the city

and put a stop on the efforts that A

have brought them sofar? _
Whether or not you believe in

great work she did in Alaska —
speciﬁcally about how shesold a
private jet on ‘eBay and ended the
“bridgeito nowhere.” What she

- did not say, and probably best on

her part, is that she supported the

$233 million bridge until Wash— ..

ington told Alaska that it would
have to pay for the project itself.
A C Additionally, during her time
as mayor of a small town and
as governor of Alaska, she sup-
ported a number of pork-barrel
projects speciﬁcally cited by /Mc-'
Cain as~ frivolous, but which she
described as integral to. the com-
munity. V W A

Palin is_ so diametrically -op-
posed to the beliefs of the aver-
age Clinton voter that the gamble
in picking Palin for a running
mate will not turn the tide for
McCain as he had hoped. ,

Now the bignews item is Pa-
lin’s pregnant daughter Bristol.
Both sides have said that attack-

ing farnilies is wrong, and that’s t

true, but Gov. Palin is now blam-
ing the media for the chatter that
surrounds the issue.

The media, however, is a beast
that doesn’t always listen to rea-

are adamantly opposed toiany sex
education that is not abstinence
only, you end up with pregnant
teens.

but when she is meant to appeal

quent. The events of three years
ago", should serve as a reminder
of that. A sense of complacency
towards the city’s protection will
only ‘lead the city to repeat the
mistakes of Katrina.

The levees of New Orleans,

_ theiorganization of evacuations

and relief efforts have sufﬁced
so far this year. However, Gustav

\
\

was not New Orleans’ true test.
It might take months, or even
years, but the chances of a storm
of Katrina’s caliber hitting New
Orleans is far too great to remove
the city’s protection as -one of the
government’s major concerns.

So while the city might have
held‘ strong against Gustav, the
efforts to safeguard the city after
Katrina are not yet where they
need to be.

Open weekends in September
West Newton, Pa., 15089

To {he lords and ladies of this good
land, we bid thee listen — for there is a
festival in town complete with one of
the world’s most unique instruments

t Playing at the Pittsburgh Renais-
sance Festival for the second year, the
Spirit of the Bells, or 35-year-old Frank
DellaPenna and his traveling carillon,
have returned to mystify audiences
But traveling is not such an easy task
—. the festival’s carillon is composed
of 35 bells and weighs llltons

A carillon is an instrument, but

. not inthe sense of a piano or saxo-

phone Defined as 23 or more bells

i that are attached and played through a

mechanical keyboard, the carillon has
bells hung and tied to a pegon the key-
board. The smaller ones can be played

’ by hand, while one’s" foot must stomp

on the largest and heaviest bells The
level of intensity used to press on the

keyboards decides the intensity of the

note played. W 7 ~..
And the Spirit of the Bells, per-

forming at the Pittsburgh Renaissance

Festival, is in fact a fairly local guest _

—+ he began  journey with the caril-

lon in Valley Forge, Pa, gs a teenager
searching for a classical piano teacher:

One private teacher; Frank Pechin’

Law, was the carillonneur for the
Washington Memorial Chapel in Val-
ley Forge and made the deal thatif the
young DellaPenna was to study piano,
he would also study the carillon,

The carillon  became the
dominant rinsttument DellaPenna
went on to become the ﬁrstAmerican
to graduate from the French Carillon
School  Tourcoing, France,‘ with a
degree of Master Carillonneur. He re-
turned to the United States and took
over Law’s position . ' ' J '

Continuing in DellaPenna’s story-
bookreality, eight years later, a com-
plete stranger walked into ‘the chapel
tower when DellaPenna forgot to lock
the chapel door. DellaPenna welcomed
the stranger and played for him. The
stranger stated that people should be
able to see DellaPenna play and soon

bought the instrument on the condi— ‘

REEL TALK WITH TOM

'Bangkok':ﬂ Cage's greatest or

“Bangkok Dangerous.”
Just take a second with that one. Breathe

it in. Savor it Nonsensical? Maybe. Silly? Oh,

yes.
That’s the No. 1 movie in the country.
This weekend was the slowest the industry

has seen in almost seven years, and still, the

few people who went to the theater chose

A “Bangkok Dangerous,” a moivieithat likely got

its title after a round of drunken Mad Libs.
Thank God for Fandango — I can’t imagine
any self-respecting moviegoer saying this title
aloud at the box office and notlaughing. Or
weeping. ' '

But then, how could you resist? After all,
there are just so many  “Bangkok Dan-
gerous” could be. p F

The marketing is cryptic but not the cool:

not the “Ohlman, what does the ‘Cloverﬁeld’
monster look like already” kind, .but more
like the “Why is that poster of Nicolas Cage
STARIN G AT l\/TE” kind. The icy gaze of his
ﬂawless blue-steel glare begs you to find out
more. * V , ' r -.
The trailer, though, is almost equally dif-

M ficult to interpret. Here are the facts: Nicolas

place.__At least, that’s\v_ihat _I understand from

-the many scenes of Cage running,  guns,
‘ dodging bullets and various combinations of

the three. ,

Why did so many people —~ relatively
speaking, at least — decide that this was worth
seeing? I blame Cage’s peakphysical condi-

tion. After all, ‘the marketing shows him doing-

a lot of what he does best + running. And if

‘his resume is any indication, the man is a mean;

I L1f1I1Cf.

“The Wicker Man,” “Face/Off,””“Crone
in 60 Seconds,” “National Treasure,” the list

goes on — most of his movies feature Cage 5
running his ass off. He ‘ran through the__airport -

in “TheFamily Man.” He even outran an ex-
plosion in “Con Air,” a feat typically reserved
_for the likes of James Bond and Ethan Hunt.
Although Cage might be able to outrun the
laws of physics, it would be unfair to ignore

another key factor to the success— of “Bangkok ’
Dangerous” — the “remake of an Asian cin- F

ema crime movie” factor._._.. . ..  ,.
' Compare" the movie to a close relative in
spirit, if _not in quality: "The Departed.” A
remake of the Hong Kong thriller “Infernal
Affairs,” "The Departed” won critical acclaim

. and big awards. \Why not emulate that formu-

la? So we start with the source movie —-— in

Newcomer Jessie Baylin not quite on fire, out certainly hot

After high school, the 24-year-old singer/

songwriter moved to Los Angeles to escape i
if her hometown. This move enabled Baylin to
record her ﬁrst album, You, available exclusive~ i
A ly at iTunes, which limited its circulation but

created buzziaround her name.

‘The newborn outlook of Fz'rerz<'g/J2‘ likely '

emerges from Baylin’s recent engagement to
Kings of Leon drummer Nathan Followill.
The album reflects where Baylin is in her

I life by describing the feelings of every young

adult who anticipates future’s secrets. \While
the generic nature of Baylin’s music allows for
a wide audience to relate to her music, it also
means that her lyrics are often cliche and too

. abstract to visualize.

‘Although Fz'm7<'g/J2‘ irispires feeling while it
plays, Baylin’s music fails to fully absorb into-
consciousness. In “Leave Your Mark,” Baylin
expresses a desire for a lover to leave his or her
mark so that she “can always find _[him]” and
his memory in her heart. Baylin is aware of

I ‘ the importance of leaving a permanent mark

in memory, yet she does notiquite achieve this
herself. e

Baylin’s music frustrates, because she com-
municates mature feelings, but Fimzg/at often
lacks the full impact her talent is capable of
producing. If she pushes herself a bit fur-
ther, Baylin’s voice has the ability to infect the
bloodstream and become part of the bodyfs
permanentmemory. As they are, the ‘feelings
in Hreugbt cast ephemeral shadows across the
mind, but inevitably their abstract substance
forces them to evaporate almost as quickly as
they appear. -

There are moments when Baylin’s music ‘

seems to capture very fragile, very human mo-
ments, revealing a glimpse of her music’s pos.—

, sibilities. \W_heniBaylin  that, “Living’s like ‘

Pitt coach Joe Luxbacher said he was

“We knew we would be in for a challenge,
but we fought har ,” said Luxbacher.

A‘ If ambiance is any indication of a grand
event, put this game on the top of the list, as
more than 400 spectators gathered to watch
the contest under a perfect night sky.

Physicality played a prevalent part in the
match from its earliest moments, beginning
with Pitt senior forward  McCormick be-
ing tackled from the side during an apparent
scoring opportunity.

That type of play was more norm than
aberration and certainly did not come as a
surprise to a Panthers club that has great fa-
miliarity with its opponent.

“These guys all knew each other from
playing one another so often,” said Lux-
bacher. 1

“They knew the match would be physi-
cal, but responded well.”

That response came in the form of disci-
plined and patient play. Still, scoring chances
were aplenty. J

McCormick had a few opportunities to
make a play streaking down the  but

Pitt 3, Penn 1

The Pitt women’s soccer team scored
two goals in the second half Friday to beat
Penn, 3-1, in its home opener at Founders
Field. " ,

Pitt coach Sue-Moy Chin said the win,
which brought Pitt to 2-2-0 on the season,
showed that the team ciuld put together a
strong performance for an entire game.

“We competed for 90 minutes,” said
Chin.

The win at Founders Field marked Pitt’s
ninth straight win at home.

Freshman Katelyn Ruhe gave the Pan-
thers the early lead with a goal in the 33rd
minute. She was assisted on the play by ju-
nior forward Ashley Habbel, who delivered a
wonderful through-ball to a streaking Ruhe.
Ruhe timed her run perfectly and looped it

over Penn goalie Caroline Williams.

“We played really well Friday night be-
cause we set the tone early,” said Chin of
the quick start.

Pitt goalkeeper Morie Kephart also
stopped all three shots she faced in the first
half and finished the game with seven saves
and an assist. '

But Penn had some ﬁght in it.

Penn rallied in the second half when
Ursula Lopez-Palm scored in the 50th min-
ute. Sarah Friedman provided the assist as
she set Lopez-Palm up right in front of the
goal. ,

Pitt answered back just four minutes
later when Habbel netted a goal. Ruhe pro-
vided the assist on the goal, switching roles
from the previous goal, which was assisted
by Habbel.

Pitt solidiﬁed a victory in the 86th min-
ute when senior Jennifer Kritch fired a shot

point on a successful weekend of play.

Forced to make adjustments because of
injuries, certain Pitt players were asked to
play different positions to compensate for a
deﬂated lineup. One such player was fresh-
man defender Sam Luffy.

“Sam, who usually plays back for us, had
to play more in the middle today. But he did
a great job for us,” said Luxbacher.

A recognized commonality in athletics
suggests scores might not always be indica-
tive of overall performance.

The same held true here, as Pitt shab-
bily turned its performance into a seemingly
lopsided victory.

“This was by no means a pretty win, but
it was a gutty win,” said Luxbacher.

The first glimpse of the gutty win came
in the 38th minute, when sophomore rnid—
ﬁelder lan Farnsworth took a cross feed
from junior forward Chris Wﬂcox to put
Pitt up 1-0. '~

Up to that point in the ﬁrst half, Lux-
bacher said the team was playing a bit on
the sloppy side.

The goal injected relief and poise in the
squad, which never looked back after claim-
ing the lead. i '

Much like the performance against
Duquesne, Pitt took the play to the Co-_
lonials in the second half only with fewer
prime scoring chances. . '

“I didn’t think we had nearly as many
chances as we did the other night, but
somehow we put three on the board,” said
Luxbacher.

Both teams were in control of their re-
spective destinies until minute 29 of the
second half.

After beating a defender, McCormick"
was positioned for a great shot at the net
when a Colonial slid in hard from behind.

Pitt was awarded a penaltykick, which
was taken by junior midﬁelder l\/like Mc- .
Dade.

McDade then -buried the ball behind the
goalkeeper, giving Pitt a 2-0 lead.

At that moment, Robert Morris was left
deﬂated. 1 I

A 43rd—minute errant pass resulted in a
3-0 Pitt lead, as Wﬂcox rocketed a shot just
outside the box. _ '

Earning its third shutout of the season,
as compared to none from last year, Pitt is
beginning to see the results stem from its
emphasis on defense. _

The Panthers’ bruised lineup, however, j
will be closely examined heading into next 
week’s matches. v ~ i i

Luxbacher said his goals for the next
game are simple.

“Get healthy,” he said. 3

Pitt came upishortin its second game

- of the weekend, losing to Charlotte, 1-0.

The loss snapped Pitt’s .nine—game winning
streak at home.

Chin said Pitt’s problem Sunday was
the inability to score when the team should
have. . i

‘We had a lot of chances but didn’t capi-
talize on them,” said Chin.

Charlotte forward W/hitney \X'/einraub ‘

scored the only goal of the match in the

~ 22nd minute. Weimaub scored off a shot

taken by Whitney Bryant, who flicked a shot
that was initially blocked by Pitt goal keeper

- Kephart. Nikki Dumencich also added an

assist.
Despite the loss, Chin said her team
played hard. _ i '
“Our leadership has been good, and a lot
of girls step up in different moments,” said
Chin. ' _
f Pitt was out-shot 6-1 in the . game.

 Kephart did her part stopping ﬁve out of
i‘ the six shots that came her way, but Pitt sirn-
 ply didn’t supply the offense.

 

 

The loss put Pitt under .500, as they fell
to 2-3-0-. But Chin had a positive outlook
on how Pitt played over the weekend, saying
the chances were there to win. She also said
she has one goal for the season.

“Our goal is" to get to the Big East Tour—-

nament,” she said. .

Pitt will look back to get into the win col-
umn when they host Kent.State Friday night
