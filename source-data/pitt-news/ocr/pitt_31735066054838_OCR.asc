Part-timers fume about  

lack of summer benefits

Greg Fischer

   

As far as part—time faculty
unemployment benefits go, Pitt is
following the law, but may be saving
money at the cost of students’ educa-
tion.

A debate at yesterday’s Faculty
Assembly meeting centered around
the issues of part—time faculty’s
inability to receive summer unem-
ployment benefits and generally
poor treatment of part—time faculty
by the University.

According to Pennsylvania. state
labor referees, part—time faculty
members’ “reasonable assurance” of
having classes to teach in the fall
and the fact that summer is viewed
only as a break, it is legally impossi-
ble for part—time faculty to collect
unemployment during summer.

“The law states that if there is
reasonable assurance of their return,
they can’t collect benefits,” said
University General Counsel Lewis
Popper.

Pitt and the state labor referees
may say part-time faculty are rea-
sonably assured of having work in
the fall, but often classes are can-
celled at the last minute and part-
timers lose work.

“I was scheduled to teach an

 

     

English literature course in the
spring,” said Patricia Harrington-
Wysor, a part—time faculty member.
“I was informed at 10 a.m. [yester-
day] that it had been cancelled.”

According to Harrington-Wysor,
she collected summer unemploy-
ment benefits for three of her seven
years teaching at Pitt. This year,
however, seven part—time faculty
applied to receive benefits, which
made the University put a stop to the
practice.

In response to the applications,
Pitt hired Reed, Smith, Shaw, and
McClay, one of Pittsburgh’s top law
firms, to make its case against the
part—time faculty members’ claims.

“It would only cost Pitt $2,000
per teacher in benefits,” said
Harrington-Wysor, “More than that
was probably spent per lawyer on
legal fees.”

This kind of retaliation by the
University against part—time faculty
is just one factor in the generally
poor treatment part—time faculty say
they receive.

For instance, according to
Harrington-Wysor, she only receives
$10,000 per year for teaching four
classes.

“There are more part—time than
full—time faculty in the English

When the ‘finals crunch is on,
students must cope with stress

 

It’s that time of the year again: all-
night study sessions, caffeine fixes,
study groups, and stress. Finals week
will soon be upon us, and many stu-
dents are feeling the pressure.

“At thebeginning of the term and
during midterms, you really feel like
you have to do well,’’ said Jen
Samuefs, a Pitt freshman. “Right now,
I’m just so sick of dealing with study-
ing and writing papers.”

Different classes require a variety

of approaches to studying. Freshman
Tara Pichney said the amount of
studying she does depends on the dif-
ficulty of the class.

“If it’s a hard class, I’ll study a
couple of days before the exam, but if
it’s an easier class, I’l1 study the night
before,” said Pichney.

Another freshman, Danielle
Nestor, takes a different approach. She
said she tends to put it off until the last
minute.

“I’d rather study for my easier
classes, because I feel more produc-

efforts, Kline said he feels the frater-
nity is able to go after quality as
opposed to quantity. TEPhi will have
13 members by the end of this term.

“How can you call someone a
brother,” Kline said, “if you can’t call
them a friend?”

Kline said the work was not
always easy and some brothers were
left to question the payoff.

“There were lots of struggles,”
Kline said. “There were times when
certain members came to meetings
and said ‘Why are we doing this?”’

Kline said the brothers’ dedication
strengthened their friendship.

“I personally have found that I
have close ties with the brothers and
plan to keep in contact with the chap-
ter even after I graduate,” Kline said.
“I think it will last forever. I might not
have known [the brothers] as well if it
weren’t for all the wor .”

Expecting to have 30 initiated
pledges by this spring, Kappa Sigma
is hoping to become the newest char-
tered fraternity at Pitt. ‘

Members of Kappa Sigma were
initiated as pledges on April Fool’s
Day last year. They are a recognized
colony of the national Kappa Sigma
fraternity, according to their presi-
dent.

Nader Abul—Ela, president of
Kappa Sigma, said it was the initial
effort of the men that brought about
the success of the fraternity».

Abul—Ela said Kappa Sigma first
set goals for the fraternity.

“First and foremost, you have to
have leadership, scholarship, and be
gentlemen,” Abul—Ela said. “We don’t
like the way fraternities are presented
across the country as animal houses.
We have to change that.”

Believing that the “makeup of a
fraternity is its men,” Abul—Ela said
the first step is to find a group that fits
into your goals and to keep adding on
to them. After that, it’s time to worry
about the regulations the nationals
and the University sets up, he said.

Kappa Sigma is not a new name in
the catalog of Pitt’s fraternities. This
is the third and last time the pledges
will have a chance to colonize at Pitt.

Previously, a colony disbanded in
1929 and another colony disbanded a
few years ago after failing to get the
national charter. Abul—Ela, Jeff
Fortier and Ryan Riehle are the only
men left from the original interest
group. They responded to an ad in The
Pitt New calling for men interested in
starting a fraternity.

The ad was placed by a member
of the most recent colonization
attempt, in the hopes of getting a
Kappa Sigma house at Pitt, said Abul-
Ela.

Abul—Ela said the nationals are
making things tougher on them due to

the past failures. After two years of
work, they will apply for their nation-
al charter in the spring.

Fortier, the KS secretary, keeps
the plaque from the Kappa Sigma
house of 1929 in his room.

“For a while I felt there were
some inadequate men,” Fortier said.
“After the process of spring cleaning,
the men who were left are the men to
be Kappa Sigs.”

Abul—Ela and Fortier said they are
looking forward to applying for their
charter, but they stay focused on what
needs to be done now. “It takes a lot
of patience,” said Abul—Ela, the oldest
Kappa Sigma.

“And dedication,” Fortier inter-
jected. A

Fortier said he was surprised that
the Pitt Greek system is so heavily
regulated. In order to have a party, it
must be official,- Fortier explained. A
guest list must be registered with the
IFC before and after the party. There
is no hard liquor permitted and alco-
hol quantity must be limited.

Most nationals also require that
their houses do a specified amount of
charity work per semester and raise a
certain amount of money for charity
as well.

At Pitt, Greeks are required to
donate blood yearly in exchange for
points awarded during Greek Week, a
series of events which take place in
the spring. .

Though seven fraternities either
lost their national charters or were put
on social probation last ‘year, those

starting a fraternity expressed that 9

they were so busy with their work
they did not have time to be disheart-
ened by outside events.

Members of suspended houses
said iteis their relationship to the com-
munity that should be the true evi-
dence of Greek spirit. Delta Sigma
Phi, Alpha Epsilon Pi, Sigma Epsilon,
FIJI, and Phi Kappa were all put on
social probation last semester, yet
continue to do charity work and play a
positive role in the community.

“Charity helps people that aren’t
on the Pitt campus,” said Jeremy
Childs, community service chair of
AEPi. “University students can afford
the necessities, like those of us who
can afford college. We need to help
people who have trouble surviving on
their own.”

ZBT, who lost their national char-
ter last year, will have the chance to
recolonize at Pitt in four years; Pi
Lamda Phi originally lost their nation-
al charter, but it was reinstated nation-
ally on June 21, according to Kerrie
Daley, the Greek adviser.

“Pitt cannot revoke a charter,”
said Daley. “They can choose not to
recognize an organization.”

Pitt Police screen candidates
for seven spring openings

Ian Dryburgh

 

 

The Pitt Police and Chief Rick
Boyd are currently in the process of
hiring seven new officers for the force.
Two retirements will leave vacancies
that will be filled by the end of the

year, and five others will be added by

early spring.

According to Boyd, he has
received about 100 to 150 applicants,
and the majority of them have already
gone through academy training. About
25 of them are females.

The applicants are called in for an
initial interview, where they are evalu-

ated by a team of current supervisors A

and officers. They are asked questions
and evaluations are based on the
answers given. After all of their infor-
mation is recorded, they may be asked
back for a second interview.

After the second interview, a few
applicants are selected to take physi-
cals. If they pass, they are then subject
to a drug test, a psychological test, and
finally a background investigation. The
applicant’s driving record and possible
arrest record are also reviewed.

“What I’m looking for is integrity
and intelligence,” Boyd said. “I also
look for personal motivation — their
ability to think on their feet, and how
hard they will work. These all come
into play.”

He also said a college education
gives them a tremendous edge but is
not a prerequisite. A

“Police work is not a blue—collar
job anymore,” Boyd said. “It’s chang-
ing for the better and is by no means a
simple job. You have to know about a
wide range of subjects: psychology,
civil service, criminal law, etc. It’s nice
to see the trend of getting a lot more

educated people involved.”

Once they pass all of the tests, new
members of the force get their uni-
forms, apply for their official creden-
tials and actual certifications, and are
recognized as uniformed police offi-
cers. However, the new recruits will be
hired under a nine-month probationary
period, during which they can be fired
for just about anything. *

“During this period, we can usual-
ly detect any weaknesses they might
have, and we will address them,” Boyd
said.

Each recruit is assigned a Field
Training Officer [FTO], who follows
him everywhere he goes during proba-
tion. For the first 15 weeks, a senior
officer teaches the recruit everything
from the Pitt campus geography to how
to handle different types of calls.

After oversight by a senior officer,

new recruits are assigned a new FTOA

every 30 days, so they have the oppor-
tunity to learn from several people.

FTOS are Volunteering officers
who are specially trained in coaching
and evaluating performance. Each pre-
sents a written report on the trainee’s
progress each day.

“The FTC program is one of the
most innovative things I’ve seen in law
enforcement,” Boyd said. “We want
every officer to go out there and do a
damn good job right from the start.”

The overall process of hiring a new
group of officers takes about six to 10
weeks. The Pitt Police force just hired
six new officers in the past year, bring-
ing the total number to 64. Adding the
seven who will be hired and consider-
ing the two retirements, the total will
reach 69.

All final decisions regarding hiring
new officers will be made by Chief
Boyd .

Greeks

According to Fortier, despite the
work and occasional doubts, being a
founding father is something he
regards with pride and satisfaction.

“The most important things, are
gaining friendships among the partic-
ipants,” Kline said. “Keeping moti-
vated, getting known on campus, and
letting other fraternities know you are

trying to start out.”

Guzman gave one last piece of
advice. .

“Whoever is going to undertake
the bulk share is going to wear many
hats. Choose a person [for president]
that is tirelessly and thoroughly dedi-
cated to the end goal and has a lot of
vision,” he said.

Dental school must narrow 1,500 applicants to 80 enrollees

;Daniel|e Shuster

Men and women dressed uniform-
ly in navy blue pin—stripped suits sat
nervously awaiting the opportunity to
open the door to their futures or have it
slammed shut in their faces last
Monday morning.

This was not a group of military

I officers awaiting orders, but a group of

prospective students interviewing for
admission into the University of
Pittsburgh’s School of Dental
Medicine.

The big attraction to the school is

ing to Albert Whitehead, director for
student services. “[Virtually] no one
graduates without a job,” he said.

He said the school will consider
over 300 of the over 1,500 applications
they receive. They then narrow down
the 300 to 80 enrollees by April.

Most Pitt undergraduates consider
a full course load to be 15 credits a
semester, complainabout having so lit-

tle time off, and consider paying.

almost $10,000 in tuition and fees out-
rageous. What many people don’t real-
ize is that dental students take an aver-
age of over 20 credits a term, go to
school year—round, and pay about
$35,000 in tuition, fees, and living

costs a year.

To graduate from the dental school
a student must also pass a two-part
board examination and a regional
examination for the part of the country
in which they want to practice. Most of
the specialty programs require two or
three more years of schooling, and it
takes as many as six years to become
an oral surgeon.

But many say it isn’t just the job
security and money that makes them
go into the field.

“I chose dentistry because of the

personal relationship that I can have
with my patients,” said Daron Praetzel,
a fourth—year student and president of

the American Student Dental
Association. “I think dentistry can play
a major role in a patient’s health. Early
detection of cancer can be seen in the
oral cavity, a patient’s appearance can
be improved, and the overall health of
the patient can be evaluated.”

Relationships with patients start
while the student is still in dental
school.

Students must have their own
patients just like practicing dentists.
They do this by bringing in someone
they know, or they work on a walk-in
patient. i

Many patients chose to go the the
school because it accepts almost every

kind of insurance and the cost is low.

For example, most dentists in the area
charge $600 for a crown, while the
school charges $250.

In the small amount of spare time
dental students have, many participate
in the American Student Dental
Association, which is like a Student
Government Board for the dental
school. Many others work on charity
projects.

One such project was called “What
Big Teeth You Have.” This program
was set up at the Carnegie museum to
teach elementary school children about
dental health. There, children could
look at skulls of animals to learn about
the structure and importance of teeth
and relate this information to'their own
teeth. At the end of the program, the
children were’ invited to the dental
school to play dentist for the day. A

After the program was over, the
dental school received several awards,
including one from the Department of
Health and Human Services. The pro-
gram is now travelling to local elemen-
tary schools.

Because of the opportunities it
provides, many dental students said
they are very proud of their school. I

“I was accepted at a few other
schools,” said Praetzel. “I chose Pitt
because the facilities were better and
the overall student attitude was much
better.”

department,” said Harrington-

‘Wysor. “We make undergraduate

education possible in certain depart-
ments, but get paid very little.”

According to Popper, it is not
the University, but the individual
departments that are responsible for
part-time faculty’s low compensa-
tion.

“Changes to allocations can be
made at the departmental level,”
said Popper. “Deans can make deci-
sions to change salaries for their
departmental faculty.”

But salary is not the only area in
which part-time faculty feel mis-
treated.

According to Harrington—Wysor,
part-time faculty also want more
reliable contracts from Pitt concern-
ing job availability, more advance
notice on cancellations to classes
they are preparing for, and benefits
like tuition stipends. A

“Part-time faculty have to pay
for courses they take here, while any
staff member doesn’t,” said
Harrington-Wysor. “This would be
an out—of—pocket expense "for the
University," and would be good for
graduate students who continue to
teach.”

Many of the full—time faculty
present’ at the meeting were support-
ive of the part-time faculty mem-

bers’ position. No administrators

attended the meeting.

“This has nothing to do with the
law, butwith how we treat our fac-
ulty,”. said assembly member Walter
Goldburg. “This is an administrative
decision, and none of them are
here.” '

Goldburg was referring to the
absence of a representative from the
provost’s office, who usually
attends assemb y meetings.

“Pitt wants quality faculty, so it
has to be very concerned with how

part-time teachers are treated,” said"

Harrington-Wysor. “I think the
University is in big trouble if it
allows this to happen.”

at my papers,” Nestor said.

This semester’s calendar offers
another challenge to many students.
The late Thanksgiving break allowed
students only one week before the final
exam period. Some students said they
feel that this should have been taken
into consideration.

“There’s just so much to do this
week. No one does any work over the
Thanksgiving break,” Jessika Cavin
said. “For a lot of people, this past
weekend was the first time they have
seen their friends ‘and families since
this past summer.”

Cavin said she wishes she had

Koesel of the Counseling Center at Pitt
said she also realizes the short time
between breaks has added pressure to
some students.

“It seems like we’ve had, more
people come to us stressed out this
year than in past years because of the
time between breaks,” Koesel said. “It
seemed like it sneaked up on them.”

She said stress that comes from
work and classes can sometimes carry
over to other aspects of the college life,
including relationships.

The weight of certain finals in
relation to the entire class grade has
some students concerned.

New restaurant aims for the over-21 crowd

Erin A. Brennan

 

A new restaurant boasting a live-fire
brick oven is coming to Oakland just in
time for a pizza break during ﬁnals week.

Fuel & Fuddle, a restaurant and bar, is
coming to 212 Oakland Ave., where
Calico’s used to be. Loosely translated,

' “Fuel & Fuddle” simply means “food and

drink.” _

After Calico’s closed, the_ owners of
Uncle Sam’s Gourmet Subs, which is locat-
ed next door to the new bar, grabbed the
space and has been leasing it for three
months. 0

Mike Hanley, one of three new own-

ers, talked about the construction work .

   
  
  

Kaufmann’s

being done on the new bar.

“We totally gutted out [Calico’s],' and
one of the toughest things was installing the
6,000-pound oven, then putting the bricks
around it,” said Hanley.

The authentic brick oven will cook all
of the wood—ﬁre grilled foods and pizzas.
Fuel & Fuddle will also have a full menu of
items, complete with appetizers, soups, sal-
ads, and sandwiches.

“We will provide healthy, good food at
good prices,” Hanley said. “And the cook-
ing area is totally exposed, which lends to
the restaurant’s unique atmosphere.”

'In addition to the food, Hanley said
over 10 diﬁerent beers will be on tap at all
times. The restaurant will have two in-
house private label beers.

“We will brew small batches of our
Fire Brick Ale and a Pumphouse Pale Ale,”
said Hanley, “and a portion of the proﬁts
made from these beers will go to a local
charity.”

But those of you who are not 21 will be
carded if you try to purchase beer.

“We will be very big on carding,
because we are shooting for the over—21
crowd,” Hanley said.

There will be an opening party on Dec.
7, and, according to Hanley, the restaurant
will be in full operation by mid—December.

Hanley’ said he is looking forward to
the opening.

“I truly feel that it’s going to turn out to
be a really neat and unique restaurant,” he
said. '

  Teen curfew punishes the
many for crimes of the few

Remember when your parents used to tell you that
you had the life, that life would only get worse when
you got older? Well folks, one more freedom has been
stripped from the youth of Pittsburgh. Now, there is a
curfew.

People 16 and under must now either be indoors or
in front of their homes between the hours of 10 p.m.
and 6 a.m. from September to June. In the summer,
they are fortunate enough to get one extra hour of free-
dom, making their imprisonment last from 11 p.m. to
6 a.m.

Does the government have the right to overstep
parental authority and set up curfews? We think not. It
is a parent’s job to determine the maturity of his child
and to determine the curfew for that child.

It isn’t fair to punish all minors for the transgres-
sions of a few. Believe it or not, it is only a small seg-
ment of the 1.6 and under population that causes trou-
ble. If you think about it, that’s not much different
from the fact that it is only a small segment ofcthe over
16 population which commits crime. Should all people
be subjected to a curfew because if anyone is outside
of his house, he could do something bad or something
bad could happen to him? If that is the case, then peo-
ple should never leave their homes at all.

To institute a curfew for all people 16 and under is
to punish the youth for being young. The scariest thing
about it is the fact that this is not only happening in
Pittsburgh; having youth curfews is a trend that is
growing across the country with other cities, including
New Orleans, Los Angeles, and Baltimore.

It is time for the government to back off and allow
parents to be just that: parents. Not only are youth cur-
fews senseless, but they are also unfair to the youths of
this city who aren’t doing anything wrong, as well as
to the parents who are doing an adequate job raising
them.

Shattering the Nativity Story illusions

 

I can see the headlines now.

“SCANDAL! Children of
Prominent Villagers Flee; They’re
Only Engaged, but She’s Already
Pregnant; Couple Reportedly Fled
South to His Farnily’s Hometown.”

Gripping? Titillating?

Well, surprise: I have just
described to you a small part of the
real Nativity story — the "part that
never quite makes it to church
pageants in retelling the circum-
stances of the birth of Jesus Christ
two millennia ago. Indeed, our
Western “Christian” culture has
actually passed down through the
years a number of details which,
unfortunately, have nothing to do
with the truth because of our col-
lective ignorance about the Bible
and Middle Eastern culture.

Last year around this time, I
came across a colurrm by Mark
Roth, assistant managing editor for
special projects for the Pittsburgh
Post-Gazette, which piqued my
interest, so I did a little more
research. (Thanks to New

Testament scholar Ken ‘Bailey of

Jerusalem’s Tantur Ecumenical
Institute, whom Roth quoted liber-
ally, and an unnamed coworker of
mine for providing some of the
information.)

This much we do know: Mary
and Joseph did indeed travel from
Nazareth in Palestine to
Bethlehem, so that Joseph, whose
clan came from Bethlehem, could
be enrolled as part of the census
decreed by then—Roman emperor
Caesar Augustus.

However, only Joseph really
needed to go; Mary went with him
only because her life would have in
danger due to her alleged “trans-

. gnession” (in fact, he too could

have been stoned to death). He
allowed her to accompany him
only because God’s purpose was
revealed to him in a dream. As it
was, they stayed in Bethlehem,
where they probably had arrived
days or even weela before the

birth, for some time in part so that

the “scandal” would die down.

Legend has it that the couple
tried to get lodging and the
innkeeper they sought out only had
the stable available. Not exactly —
more likely they would have stayed
with his relatives in the guest room
(translated into English as -“inn”),
which would have likely been
jammed anyway because of other
out-of—town relatives also in for the
census. The stable where Jesus was
born was likely located underneath
the two—room house, common in
that day.

Tradition also says that “three

-wise men” descended on the stable

soon after Jesus’ birth — not
according to Matthew 2. For open-
ers, the astrologers themselves
weren’t numbered —— “three” only

refers to the number of gifts they V

brought. And besides that, as they
came from somewhere “in the
east” (likely Persia), it took them
up to two years to get to
Bethlehem. By that time, Jesus,
Mary and Joseph had already
moved out of the stable and into the
house.

Legend also has it that Christ
was born Dec. 25, on a cold and
snowy winter night. Uh — no. First
of all, no one knows for sure the
actual date of Christ’s birth; some
say October, others April. And
besides, that part of the world is
desert area and likely neverdid see
much snow. (The date comes from
a Roman winter festival which the
church eventually incorporated

around the 4th Century A.D.,
changing it to “Christ’s Mass.”
Which is‘why you also won’t see
either Christmas trees or yule logs
in the Biblical account.)

Other’ mistakes concerning
Jesus’ life: In the Roman Catholic
Church, Mary remained a virgin.
This directly contradicts Matthew
1:24 and 25, which clearly state
that she and Joseph had sexual rela-
tions. Besides that, according to
Matthew 13:55 and 56, Jesus had
four brothers — James, Joses,
Simon and Judas — and at least
two sisters who were neither num-
bered or named.

Jesus is also often described as
a “poor carpenter.” According to
my coworker, that doesn’t quite
ring true either; in fact, as a skilled

, craftsman, he would have been a

village elder. That should explain
why his reading the Torah during
worship would have surprised no
one. The surprise only came when
he declared to the rest of the con-
gregation in Luke 4:21, “Today this
scripture [Isaiah 61:1 and 2, which
he had just read] is fulfilled in your
hearing.” ,

And Jesus also created scandal
when he began his public ministry.

In that culture, since his father-
Joseph, likely dead, ‘was no longer»

on the scene he was expected to
support his mother ﬁnancially. And
when he told the rich young ruler in
Luke 18 to sell all he had and give
the proceeds to the poor, he knew
what he was talking about; he had
done it himself!

Mind blown yet? I wouldn’t be
surprised. But I hope this piece
gives a little bit of insight into a
story —— and a person —- we’ve
neglected for far too long.

Rick Nowlin expects letters about
this one.

Pitt in Rome gives students the opportunity of cilifetime

   

You dont have to be Julius
Caesar to take over the streets of
Rome. Just being a Pitt student is
enough.

Last summer was the first year
that the University of Pittsburgh’s
Italian study abroad program went to
Rome —— and it was a complete suc-
cess.

Pitt students spent five weeks
chasing around the various sites of
Rome. Dennis Looney, the chair of
the Italian and French department,
along with Kristen DeGennaro, was

. our guide by day and we explored on

our own by night.

Imagine wandering side streets,
sharing capricciosa pizza and kiwi
gelato and coming upon Piazza
Venezia in all‘ its brightly lit glory
with the Colosseum and the Roman
Forum as an illuminated back—drop.

Take all of this brilliance and mesh it
with American pop culture: free con-
certs along the Tevere, the pubs of
Santa Maria in Trastevere and the
romance of the Trevi Fountain. Now
you have just a hint of what it was
like to be in Rome.

As an American student traveling
through Italian streets, it was a per-
sonal goal to try and accustom myself
to the ins-and-outs of Roman city
life. The best way this could be done
was by taking on the streets and
allowing Rome to become “my own
private city” —— Romulus and Remus
watch out! Every chance I had to
escape was well—taken opportunity.

I wanted to improve my Italian as
well as learn more about the culture,

and in order to do that I had to blend"

in with the people. My plan was to
use my Italian language skills and
trick them into thinking that I was
one of them — and it worked»! At one

point I found myself acting as an
interpreter for a German couple who
spoke only broken English.

But rather than being selfish and
inundating this entire article with
facts about me, I think a betterway to
convey my international experience
would be by summarizing a day in
the life of a Pitt student in Italy.

Up and at’em -—— time to .explore
the Pantheon. It was a scorching day
in the city of Rome. Professor
Looney’s goal was to throw us into
the midst of the origins of the Roman
people and the foundation of their
city, while we kept our eyes peeled
for a good place to have gelato: a
confrontation between myth and glut-
tony. Of course, the great and power-
ful professor won, and we began our
journey.

Situated in an overcrowded piaz-

. za stands the ancient Pantheon: this
would be our classroom for the day.

Instead of desks and chairs, there
were cafe tables and fountains. We
practiced our street Italian with ped-
dlers‘who were trying to sell us little
soft clay trinkets ———America’s equiv-
alent is the stress ball.

I’ noticed our group was covering
every angle of the piazza scrutinizing
the exterior of the Pantheon relating
all the historical facts we had learned
earlier while tourists came, snapped a
photo, and went on to their next tour
destination. The day went well, but
we were anxious to get the nightlife
started.

All of the Pitt students agreed
that Rome byday is wonderful, but
we quickly learned that this city
transforms into a mythical show at
night. D

Editor’s note: This is the first
installment in a new series entitled
The Thursday Sit-down. Each week
a member of The Pitt News’ sports
staﬁ” will share a moment with a
local sports personality.

The Pitt News Senior Staff Writer
Kevin Lilley and Pitt Panthers’
sophomore guard Vonteego
Cummings

TPN: What made you choose Pitt?
VC: “When I was making my deci—
sion I wasn’t trying not to base it on
where everybody '
else wanted me to
go. I needed to
find the right
place for
Vonteego and I
knew Coach Jones
before I came here
and I knew Coach
Willard was a
good coach. My
last two schools were Michigan and
Pittsburgh and I finally chose
Pittsburgh.”

TPN: What was the hardest tran-
sition for you going from high
school to college?

VC: “It’s really not one thing you
have to get used to; it’s college, your
school, your practices. In high
school you may get the weekend off
but in college you don’t. You have to
go seven days and you only get one
day off.”

TPN: Do you consider yourself a
leader with Chad Varga and
Gerald Jordan out with injuries?
VC: “I look at myself as a team
   . leader mainly because they look, at
Cummings sank live free throws in last nights game. me as a 16ad€r. EVen if Chad and

"I look at myself
as u gleam leader
muinly because
they [flue players]
look at me as a
leader."

    

«

WHATEVER Ir AKES

Lilley sits down with Pitt's silly fresh,
super slick, sophomore floor
general Vonteego Cummings

Gerald come back, I play the point
and they look to me for leadership
and whatever it takes to get done, I
have to get that done.”

TPN: How do you deal with the
frustration of losing the first three
games this year?

VC: “We were all down, but we
keep trying topick each other back
up. We hope we can just come along
and get a couple in a row.”

TPN: Where do you see yourself in
five years?

VC: “In the NBA.”

TPN: What one word or phrase
describes you as
a player?

VC: “I feel I’m
very good on
defense and I do
whatever it takes
to win. If I have to
score, I score. If I
have to pass, I
pass. If I have to
rebound, I
rebound.”

TPN: Do you think this win can
get the team back on track for the
rest of the season?

VC: “I think this win will definitely
get us back because it’s a Big East
win. It’s not just a regular win, it’s
against a UConn team that we
thought was a better team last year,
but still a very good team this year,
too.’_’

TPN: Describe Coach Willard.
VC: “He really has a lot of confi-
dence in me out here. If I’m not
shooting the ball, like tonight I went
1-7, he keeps telling me to shoot the
ball. If we don’t shoot the ball we
don’t win. Coach Willard has really
helped me out a lot.”

THE PITT NEWS

The Pitt News sports guys
forecast this year's Big East

   

SYRACUSE

Coach Jim Boeheirn has done it again.
Even after the departure of top player John
Wallace for the NBA, Boeheim’s
Orangemen look to be perhaps the best‘
team inlthe Big East after reaching last sea-
son’s National Championship game.

SU’s senior guard Jason Cipolla (7.7
ppg) and senior power forward Otis Hill
(12.7 ppg, 5.4 rpg) will be the leaders of
this year’s unit. Defensive standout Todd
Burgan (12.1 ppg, 6.8 rpg,_ and 64 steals)
will be called upon to stop some of the top
scorers in the Big East this season.

Hill, who has shown up in better phys-
ical shape because NBA scouts have their
eyes on him, could be one of the best win-
dow wipers and big men in the paint this
year. Burgan is the early pick to be the
Orangemen’s MVP. He has a killer

‘ crossover dribble, and if he is able to hit his

free throws (62 percent last year) and keep
his head in games, he could be one of the
top players in the country.

Boeheim was dealt a severe blow

. when McDonald’s All-American Winfred

Walton was declared ineligible for the sea-

son. Eventually, Walton will replace

Wallace. Luckily, freshman point guard
Jason Hart is no joke. The Inglewood, Ca.

,, , native averaged 24.5 ppg, seven assists and A

six rebounds as a senior.

Guard/forward Marius Janulis (6.1
ppg, 42 percent from 3-point range) must
step up and perform for a young
Orangemen squad, and sophomore center
Elvir Ovcina will be forced to play some
major minutes when the frontliners get in
foul trouble.

Unlike last season, Head’ Coach Pete
Gillen wo ’t have to worry about inexperi-
ence on ‘s Providence squad this year.
Four seni rs should start for the Friars. S
The eam will be led by the third-team
All-Big t power forward and scoring
machin Austin Croshere (15.3 points per
game last season). Croshere will be joined
in the ontcourt by fellow senior and All-
Big E t candidate Derrick Brown, who
was second on last year’s team in both
scoring (14.8 ppg) and rebounds (6.8 rpg).
All of that forward play will be need-
ed, because the Friar backcourt won’t
score much. Senior Jason Murdock (4.3
ppg) should be the starting shooting guard,
but that’s a misnomer. He will be on the
court mainly to keep the other team from
s A ring. Sophomore God Sharnmgod will
s at the point. The Big East All-Rookie
election from a year ago is a master ball
andler, but he is also oneof the team’s

« J worst shooters.

Senior Ruben Garces (7.5 rpg) was the
starting center last year, but would be more
suited to forward if the team wasn’t so
strong there already. Garces will be chal-
lenged by freshman Ndongo N’Diaye,
who had 21 points, l4rebounds, and seven
blocked shots per game last season at
Sufﬁeld Academy in Connecticut.

  GEORGETOWN

John Thompson has had better off-
seasons.

Now entering his 25th year as head
coach of the . Georgetown Hoyas,
Thompson may have had 24 better off—sea-
sons.

First, although Thompson is one of
few coaches who has successfully kept
players loyal to four-year scholarships, he
lost underclassman superstar Allen Iverson
to the NBA.

Second, he lost senior starters Othello
Harrington and Jerome Wiﬂianis. Both
were third-team, all-league selections, and
both were good enough to crack an NBA
lineup.

Now, unranked in preseason polls, the
Hoyas are in for a rare rebuilding season.
Leading the charge is Victor Page, whose

12.5 points-per-game last season leads all A

returnees. Page earned the MVP award for
the Big East Tournament last season, and
should anchor the offense from shooting
guard.

The team’s other returning starter,
junior Boubacar Aw, should lead the
defense from power forward. He was over-
shadowed by Harrington and Wﬂliarns last
season, and -will  to improve his 4.5
points and 3.0 rebounds per game to help
the Hoyas. 

, Six-foot-9 center J ahidi White may
give away some inches to other Big East
starters, but his  boards per game off the
bench last year’ shows promise. Point
guard Joseph To’/uomou and senior forward
Ya Ya Dia should ﬁll out the starting line-
up. A «

Georgeto’/wn recruited only four fresh-
men this season, with only forward Rhese
Gibson and 6-foot-8, 205-pound for-

ward/center Shamel Jones expected to earn a

any serious playing time.

Preview

Miami Coach Leonard Hamilton has
brought in a top-notch recruiting class that
was rated as high as seventh in the country.
Leading this class is local hero Lucas
Barnes, out of (South Miami High School,
who was Mr. Basketball in Florida last
year. Barnes is not the only diaper dandy in
the bunch. Swingmen Vernon Jennings
and Johnny Hemsley, plus power forward
Mario Bland, could all make an immediate
impact.

Two keys to the success of the
Hurricanes are senior center Will Davis
and sophomore center Nick Donovan.
Davis is an athletic seven-footer who’s
been hampered by knee injuries his entire
career, but could bring stability to the mid-
dle if healthy. Donovan is from England
and is still getting used to the American
style. In the oﬁ°—season, he gained 20
pounds of muscle and worked on his inside
game.

This is a quick team that will use pres-
sure defense to create turnovers that lead to
fast breaks and exciting play. The offense
will showcase a balanced attack. With
more depth this year, Hamilton will be able
to substitute more and maintain fresh legs
all season.

Vl|.I.ANOVA

With the departure of Kerry Kittles
and Eric Eberz, one would think that trou-
bles are on the horizon for the Villanova
Wildcats. .

There’s only one problem with that.
Excellent recruiting and a solid list of
returnees have made this Big East squad
tougher than ever. , ~

Head Coach “Ratboy”  has
done an exceptional job bringing a nice
blend of youth and experience to the high-
ly—ranked Wildcats.

Villanova will look to 6—foot-11 Jason
Lawson in the middle again this season.
The two-time All-Big East secon —teamer
averaged 12.3 ppg and pulled down 6.8
boards per game last year, both tops on this
season’s team. Lappas projects Lawson as
the man to lead this team into battle for the
1996-97 campaign.

Point guard Alvin Williams will be the
star in the backcourt this year. Look for the
6—foot—5 senior to break out as one of the
top point guards in the conference.
Williams improved in every statistical cat-
egory from his sophomore to his junior
season.

And with Nets’ rookie Keny Kittles
across the river in New Jersey, the
Wﬂdcats grabbed three of its four recruits
from the Garden State in return .

Touted as one of the top recruiting
classes in the nation and the best of the
East by Eastern Basketball .is the quartet of
Malik Allen (6-foot-10; 240 pounds;
Medford, N.J.); T.J. Caouette (6-foot—7;
215 pounds; Wmﬂirop, Maine); Brian

   

 

Lynch (6-foot—6; 185 pounds; Lincroft,
N.J.); and Magic Roundball Classic M.V.P.
Tim Thomas (6—foot-10; 235 pounds;
Paterson, N.J.).

Don’t be surprised when Villanova
ﬁnishes near the top of the Big East at the
end of this season, and don’t be shocked if
the Wildcats play in early April.

BOSTON Course

Expect the Boston College Eagles to
be one of the nationally-ranked teams
coming out of the Big East Conference.

Boston College is the only team in
the league that returns all ﬁve starters and
is coming off a 19-11 season and an upset
of Indiana in the NCAA Tournament. The
Eagles surprised some teams last year
after being predicted near the bottom of
the standings.

The Eagles return the 1997 Preseason
Big East Player of the Year, 6-foot-7, 265-
pound forward Danya Abrams. The bruis-
ing forward (who averaged 19.7 ppg and
9.6 rpg last year) will be counted on to
carry the weight of the scoring this sea-
son, although a facial fracture could
impede his progress. Also in the front-
couit, dependable senior Keenan Jourdan
(7.6, 5.2) and junior Antonio Granger
(10.6, 3.4) return.

The B.C. backcourt will be led by
exciting sophomore James “Scoonie”
Penn, last year’s Big East Rookie of the
Year. Penn averaged 13.3 ppg and led the
team with 103 assists in 34.5 minutes per
game. Joining Penn will be junior Duane,
Woodward (8.8 ppg, 3.3 ppg).

Coach Jim O’Brien’s bench should
be solid, with forward Bevan Thomas
(6.9 points), center Mickey Curley and
swingman Brad Christianson contribut-
ing. -

—-n. schano

UCONN

Gone are big name players Ray Allen
(Big East Player of the Year, 23.4 ppg, 6.5
rpg), point guard Doron Sheffer (16.0 ppg,
6.1 rpg), center Travis Knight (9.1 ppg, 9.3
rpg), and forward Rudy Johnson (7.5 ppg).

So who’s left‘? The only returning
player who has started a college game is
forward Kirk King. King, a senior, aver-
aged 9.9 ppg and 6.3 rebounds while lead-
ing the team with a .575 ﬁeld goal percent-
age.

Head Coach Jim Calhoun, however,
will have plenty of talent to work with. The
Connecticut recruiting class is lead by 6-
foot-11 center Jake Voskuhl; McDonald’s
All-American guard/forward, Richard
Hamilton (23.8 ppg, 14.0 rpg as a senior at
Coatesville High School); and Mike
LeBlanc (24.1 ppg, 12.3 ppg), who teamed
with Voskuhl to help their team win its
fourth consecutive state title at Strake
Jesuit in Houston, Texas.

Last year, the Huskies won the Big
East division quite handily with an overall

Pitt beats UConn for lst win, 56-49

Pitt still can’t shake them-

selves from a four—game offensive
slump, but last night against the
University ' of Connecticut
Huskies, their defense made up
for things as they won their first
game of the season, a 56-49 con-
ference upset at the Igloo.

Pitt’s Kellii Taylor, who
scored a career-high 19 points,
and UConn senior ‘Kirk King,
who scored 18 points, were the
only people who could fight off
the tight team defenses. -

The opening 11:30» of the first
half showcased some of the worst
offensive basketball in the history
of the Big. East Conference. With
8:30 left in the half, Husky fresh-
man Jake Voskuhl hit a lay-up to
give UConn a 16-8 lead. At the
time, Pitt was 3-18 from the field.

Then Mark Blount and Taylor
turned up the pressure. Fueled by
Taylor’s pesky hands, Pitt went on
a 11-2 run. Blount scored six
points during the run and swatted

  

three Husky first half shots. He

finished the game with 10 points-

and four blocks.

A Taylor lay—up gave Pitt a
19-18 lead.

Then, a 16-foot jumper by
Dion Carson with less than a
minute left in the half gave
UConn a 20-19 lead at the half.
The margin could have been
much greater — Pitt shot only 28
percent from the field for the half.

“We played with no offensive
confidence in the first half,”
Assstant Coach Bobby Jones
said. “We were playing too tight.”

Jones, however, credits Pitt’s
pressure defense for keeping the
Panthers close.

“Kellii [Taylor] had eight of
our 22 deﬂections in the first,”
Jones said. “He’s capable of doing
that every night.”

Pitt’s pesky defense pestered
perturbed UConn players
throughout the second half as
well. A

Pitt maintained a thin margin
for the opening 10 minutes of the
second half. After freshman Isaac

Hawkins scored on an easy hoop,
Pitt enjoyed a 38-32 lead with
8:09 left.

Just when it looked like Pitt
might collapse (much like the sta-
dium scoreboard, which stayed
blank for ﬁve minutes in the sec-
ond period), senior swingman
Jason Maile hit two crucial foul
shots to put Pitt up 40-35. Taylor
then put the game away. A nifty
10-foot spin shot and a crowd-
awakening breakaway lay-up
gave Pitt a 10-point lead, 45-35.

After that, Pitt iced the game
from the line. The Huskies fouled
frequently down the stretch, but
the Panthers answered the chal-
lenge by draining 11 of 12 free
throws in the last three minutes.

“It’s all a matter of confi-
dence,” said Panther Head Coach
Ralph Willard of the improved
charity—stripe performance. Taylor
would hit six of the clutch free-
throws, while teammate Vonteego
Cummings sank the other five.

Cummings led the Panthers
with 36 minutes on the night, but

The women’s

they stayed closer to home,
Loretto, Pa., to face the Red

Freshman Michelle
Katkowski pumped in 13 points,
while Kortni Webb and Gina
Montesano pitched in with 12
apiece to lead the Panthers to a
.500 record (3-3) for the second
time this season and a 54-29
win. 1

One of the biggest reasons
Pitt won was due to the poor
play from the Red Flash. They
shot a measly 33 percent and
committed 24 turnovers.
Although the poor shooting
reminded the Panthers of their
early season woes, Pitt shot 40
percent. '

Pitt relied heavily‘ onlits

half points, 23 came from inside.

added on a Montesano 3-point
bomb. St. Francis committed 14
of their turnovers in the first
half, while shooting only 29 per-
cent from the field. Pitt took a
26-18 lead into the locker room.

‘Even though they had a big
lead, the Panthers did not let up
after the intermission.

St. Francis freshman guard
Beth Barnabei said, “Pitt hus-
tled. They went after all the
loose balls. They never stepped

‘down. on defense and always

The Lady Panthers out-
rebounded the Red Flash 41-31

for the game. They also finished

with an extraordinary\2O steals,
as opposed to St. Francis’ five.
Pitt finished with five players in
double figures. Both Kortni
Webb and Latia Howard missed
a doub1e—double by one rebound.

During the opening minutes
of the second half, Pitt extended
its lead to 41-27.’ After this, they
put the game out of reach with a
13-2 run to up the score to 54-29.

“We didn’t' do anything right
tonight,” Red Flash Coach Jenny
Przekwas said. ‘‘I don’t think any
of our players stepped up or was
mentally‘ ready to play. There
wasn’t anything positive that I
can point to.”

St. Francis dropped to 1-4 on
the season with this debacle. Pitt
capped off the win byshooting
65 percent from the foul line.

The Panthers return home
for three big games in the next
two weeks against Connecticut,
Penn State,‘ and Ohio State.

raising, and public image in gener-
al. Usually the studies and articles
attribute some of the blame to the
struggles of the Pitt football pro-
gram. Are they kidding? Some of
the blame? Try all of the blame.

With all due respect to Pitt’s
world-renowned medical school and
nationa1ly—ra-nked philosophy
department, like it or not, the
morale of the student body, the
pride (and donations) of the alumni,
and, especially, the public image of
the University all rise and fall with
the fortunes of the football pro-
gram. The win-loss record of the
football program is not merely a
factor in forming the University’s
image — it is the
University’s public image.

Most people, including those
directly involved with the football
program, probably feel that the

'l'|-IE PI'l'l' NEWS

football program should not be the
most important factor in determin-
ing whether the general public
thinks the University of Pittsburgh
is a quality institution, but it most
definitely is. Do you think that a
Notre Dame graduate has a big
“ND” sticker proudly displayed on
the window of his car because the
little Catholic university in Indiana
has a great economics department?

Of course not. People are proud
to be graduates of Notre Dame and,
most «importantly, maintain -ties to
their alma mater, because of the
Fighting Irish. It was that way at
Pitt not that long ago. It needs to be
that way again.

Quite frankly, there are no fund
raising or morale problems that a
winning Pitt football program can’t
fix. And if you don’t care about
football, that’s fine, but you should
understand that a losing football
program devalues your Pitt degree,
while a winning one enhances it.

Chancellor Wesley Posvar
understood this concept when he
hired John Majors in 1973 and gave
him a mandate, and the University
resources, to field a champion.
Unfortunately, Posvar forgot the
lesson of the 1970s when he

OPENING SOON IN PITTSBURGH

 

(JANUARY 1997

 

allowed the program to go into free-
fall in the 1980s.

Chancellor O’Connor had no
clue —- Johnny Majors had to fight
in 1993 just to get new uniforms for

the team, and we wouldn’t have the

badly—needed new weight and lock-
er rooms if Majors hadn’t rounded
up the private donors for them.

In new Chancellor Mark
N ordenberg, who was a professor at
Pitt during the glory years of Jackie
Sherrill, the University finally
appears to have a competent leader
who understands how important it
is for Pittto win. For the sake of the
entire University, here’s hoping I’m
right.

Nebraska (10-1) vs. Texas (7-
4) —- Nebraska is one of the few
universities in the country where
the football coach is more impor-
tant than the president of the uni-
versity or the governor of the state.
Texas is one of the few universities
where no football coach will ever
be able to live up to the legend of a
former coach — in Texas’ case, of
course, former Coach Darrell
Royal. What does any of this have
to do with who’s goingto win this
Big 12 title game? Not much, but
it’s as good a reason as any to pick.

Thursday, December 5, ‘I996

Nebraska 29, Texas 10.

Army (9-1) vs. Navy (8-2) —
We always hear about how nobody
but the_members of the armed ser-
vices and the old-fashioned college
football purists really care about
this rivalry anymore, but the game
is always nationally televised and is
always a sellout in Philly’s Veterans
Stadium. Obviously, somebody still
cares. Army 24, Navy 23.

Brigham Young (11-1) vs.
Wyoming (10-1) -— If you think
that Pitt is having attendance prob-
lems, what about Wyoming? The

Cowboys have been in the Top 25 7

all season but were lucky to draw
20,000 for home games. Part of the
reason for their attendance woes has
been attributed to (I’m not making
this up) the beginning of elk season.
BYU 33, Wyoming 27.

Guest pick: John Majors —-

‘Florida (10-1) ‘vs. Alabama (9-2)

-— You can take this pick to the
bank, because Coach Majors knows
Southeastern Conference football.
Coach thinks that Florida will be a

little down after last week’s emo-

tional loss to Florida State, but still
has the horses to win this SEC
championship game. Florida 27,
Alabama 14.

Coach Brce sees bright future for the Lady Panthers

  

Megan Borofski
.. <-—- M‘

 

The Lady Panthers knew they

were going to have it rough.

Coming off a 6-24 record from
last year and recording the most
losses ever in one season_by a Pitt
women’s basketball team, they
needed to rebuild. And with the
early portion of their 1996-97
schedule one of the toughest in Pitt
history, there was a lot of pressure
for them to perform.

But who would have expected
that when the Pitt women’s basket-
ball team had their first chance to

S  prove themselves, they would give a

top-10 team a runfor their money?

"I knew we were capable of
playing like that,” Coach Kirk
Bruce said. “I knew it.”

The team lost a close game to
the seventh-ranked Virginia
Cavaliers, 64-55, despite junior
Latia Howard’s 12 points in the first
half. Pitt was within five points with
five minutes remaining in the game.

‘ The Lady Panthers, now ?-?,
have continued to play with that
determination. The team‘ has lost
two close games to Miami (Ohio)

.' and Virginia, both within 10 points,

and suffered» a 31-point loss to
Hawaii on the road. But they’ve also

checks in next, with 50 total points
for the season (10.8 per game). She
leads the team with 23 defensive
rebounds. Gina Montesano and
Nickeia Morris are also high in the
ranks in both scoring and rebounds.
Morris is a 6-foot-7 freshman center
and is the tallest player in Pitt
women’s basketball history.

“Latia, Missy, Gina, and Nickeia
are the bulk of our scoring,” Bruce
said. “But our guards have been
more consistent with their scoring,
and some of our players that haven’t
been in the forefront are starting to
produce.”

Freshman Michelle Katkowski_
is a perfect example. The point
guard has had double figures in two
of the four games she has played.

“Michelle handles the ball really
well and is a good defender,” Bruce
said. “She combines with JoJo
Guzman to create a powerhouse for
us at point guard.”

Guzman, a redshirt junior, leads
Pitt with 18 assists. When added to
Howard, Thompson, and
Montesano, she and Kelly Senneca
round out the starting five.

“We play. a lot of different‘play-
ers,” Bruce said. “And all of them
are going to play bigger roles than
they are used to. I expect all my
young ladies to step up to that chal-
lenge.”

Willard hopes the third

time really is a charm

Matt Grove

Chances are the Pitt men’s basket-
ball team would like to take a page out
of Cher’s book and turn back time. The
Panthers came into the season with high
hopes, but so far they have been any-
thing but on top of the world.

Head Coach Ralph,Willard’s squad
entered last night’s game against
Connecticut with a disappointing 0-3
mark that included an embarassing
home-openerloss against Illinois State
and a questionable defeat at the hands
of Navy. Pitt traveled to the Dean Dome
and battled Carolina hard for 35 min-
utes before falling victim to Tarheel tra-

dition and Antawn Jamison.

The Panthers have a solid back-
court, even after the loss of Jerry
McCullough to graduation. Smooth 6-
foot-4 guard Vonteego Cummings will
likely carry the bulk of the Panthers’
workload around the perimeter. The
sophomore has been dubbed one of the
top defensive players in the conference
and has returned with an even more
exciting game.

“I have confidence when I’m out
there,” Cummings said. “And I think
the team has confidence in me, and I

just have to go out there and dowhat it
takes to win.”
Senior designated gunner Jason

Maile returns as one of Pitt’s three elder’ 5

statesmen and hopes to pick up where
he left off at the end of last season. In

1995-1996, the Forest City, Pa. native '

was 33-79 from beyond the are, a .418
shooting percentage. Maile ﬁnished hot
in his ﬁnal ﬁve games, knocking down
16 of 30 trifectas.

Despite being labeled a true point
guard, the seemingly effortless Kelliil
Taylor has nailed down a starting spot
at shooting guard alongside Maile.
Taylor returns after sitting out nearly all
of last season with a back injury. The 6-
foot redshirt freshman played in Pitt’s
season opener against Georgia last year
and hit three of five 3—pointers for nine
points. Junior Kevin Willard and 6-
foot-2 freshman Jarrett Lockhart will
also get some playing time in the back-
court.

last-season  a loss to Boston College
in the Big East Tournament ended the
Panthers’ season. Only one day passed
before Willard had his crew, who had
been pushed around all season by big-
ger, stronger opponents, in the weight

meatballs until retirement.

I’d like to know why the Pitt
administration finds so many ways to
screw students over. I’d like to know
why I_ get five bucks back for a book
that costs 60. I’d like to know why
we have a student escort service. I’d
like to know why Yolande Campbell
is the head of the Student Pub board.
These questions have answers, but
Pitt won’t talk.

There are a couple people out
there I wish to heap praise upon and a
couple apologies I must say. First, I
am sorry for some of the poor cover-
age in this year’s sports section. It’s
hard when you’re working with a
staff of nine dependable people who
have class, jobs, wives, etc. I’m a
dumb hippie, who seized the opportu-
nity to further his potential career. I
made many mistakes in doing so, and
the
process. In the words of Beavis,
“Sorry about that.”

Some people I’d like to thank are
Ron Wahl, Sam Sciullo, and the rest
of Pitt Sports Information. You guys
do a super job, and we couldn’t sur-
vive without‘ your help. .

I’d also like to thank Johnny
Majors. To watch how gracefully this
proud man handled the situation dealt
to him this year gave me a new per-
spective on life. Although .Majors
may like to forget the last four years,

 

TI-IE PITT NEWS

 

FROM PAGE 22

he’ll never admit it. He’s proud of
what he’s accomplished, and rightful-
ly so. The man is a legend. He’s
someone I look up to, and I wish him
only the greatest of success.

I’d also like to throw some quick
shout—outs to coaches like Dave
Sobal, Cindy Alvear, Kirk Bruce, and
Rande Stottlemyer. I feel vindicated
when coaches compliment the sec-
tion, and these four certainly were the
best coaches to deal with during my
years here. I

After all that ranting, the time has
come for me to step aside, for others
to have a chance to experience the
wonderful run I’ve had here at The
Pitt News. I’ve gotten the chance to
meet so many people\and follow two
teams I will always love and support:
Pitt football and basketball. Maybe
sometimes I’ve been too harsh in my
criticisms, but it’s hard watching the

* teams you grew up dreaming of play-

ing on struggle so severely. Even so,
I vow to continue my support of Pitt
athletics and I know one day, we’ll
still be winners off the field, and
we’ll win again on the field. Hail to
Pitt!

Mike Kovak hopes he did a decent job
as sports editor for The Pitt News
and invites anyone to visit him as he
lives out his life in a one room effi-
ciency —— lonely and penniless.

Mens

room preparing for the future.

The future is now, and the Panther
big men have bulked ‘up, but they have
also been hit with serious injuries. Six-
foot~6 senior captain Chad Varga,

Pitt’s top returning scorer from last I

year (12.7 ppg), is out indefinitely
with a stress fracture in his leg. The
third senior, 6—foot—l1 Gerald Jordan,
has been bothered by a foot injury and
has missed Pitt’s first three games.

Michael Gill jumped ship after a
disappointing freshman year, but the
new and improved versions of 7—foot
center Mark Blount and 6—foot-8 for-
ward Andre Howard are taking up
considerable space in the paint.

Both Blount and Howard have

 

added at least 15 pounds to their
frames since last year. They will have
to handle most of the battling inside
until Varga and Jordan return.
Intimidating freshman forward Isaac
Hawkins (6—foot—8, 210 pounds) will
have to hit the weights if he plans on
becoming a Big East force.

Willard is excited about his team
so far this year despite the opening
losses.

“I think they are blending togeth-
er,” he said. “The kids really, really
enjoy each other. That’s one of the
things that’s obvious. They don’t care
who plays well, and when someone
comes off the bench they’re rooting
for that guy.”

UConn i

could only manage eight points. He
made up for it with defense, helping to
hold the UConn backcourt of Ricky
Moore and Richard Hamilton to a total
of nine points.

“We just wanted to play smart,”
said Cummings. “We wanted to be
patient. Our defense got us back in it
— if we box out, we can play with any
team.”

Andre Howard led the Panther
box-out brigade with seven boards,
while Issac Hawkins finished with
five. Hawkins ‘also recorded two

 

blocked shots, one on the heels of a
Blount denial that shut down UConn’s
ﬁnal rally late. The swats would throw
the Huskies out of step, and force
Rashamel Jones into fouling Maile.
Maile, who went 1-11 from the
ﬂoor on the night, drained his
shots, and made a free throw on the
team’s next possession before Blount
was charged with a lane violation.

Taylor quickly followed up with his

two straight buckets, and the Panthers
weathered the late Husky foulfest to
earn the victory.

record of 32-3 and a 17-1 conference mark.
They rolled through the NCAA tourna-
ment until being upset by Mississippi
State.

Aside from King, the next player with
even a remote amount of experience is
sophomore point guard Ricky Moore, who
averaged 4.7 ppg and 3 assists whﬂe play-
ing just under 20 minutes per game. He
probably will be the man looked to to lead
the Husky offense. .

A lot of questions must be answer

1 for the Huskies, including who will start at

the other three positions. Calhoun has a lot
of holes to ﬁll, but a very talented roster, so
don’t be surprised if UConr1 is up near the
top of the Big East again this year.

—i. dryburgh
Sr. .loHN’s‘

Under new Head Coach Fran
Fraschilla, who is coming off four years of
superb success at Manhattan College (85-
35), expect the St. John’s Red Storm to

THE PI'I"l' NEWS

vastly improve on last year’s 10-16 (5-13)
mark and make a run at the NCAA
Tournament.

Preseason All-Big East selection
Zendon Hamilton, whose 20.8 ppg and
10.3 rpg average ranked him as the only
conference player to average a double-
double for the season, will lead the charge.
Look for Hamilton to continue to be a
monster in the paint.

Felipe Lopez needs to live up to the
hype and improve on his 16.2 ppg. His
numbers are solid for a college player, but
he needs to become the blue-chipper,
poster-boy star everyone expected him to
be when he was ranked as the nation’s top
schoolboy. Under the energetic and youth-
ful Fraschilla, expect Lopez to have a
breakout year. I

Tenacious forward Tyrone Grant, who
pulled down 15 boards last season against
Pitt, is a player who will not wow you with
speed or athletic ability, but his attitude and
instinct could prove to be a big factor for
St. John’s in 1996-97.

 

Shooting guard Tarik Turner (4.0 ppg)
and Carneroon’s rebounding hoss Charles
Minlend (12.7 ppg, 8.5 rpg) should round
out the starting lineup. A few key reserves
to check out are Fred Lyson (38 percent
from downtown), and freshmen Collin
Charles and Lavor Postell.

WVU

The Mountaineers enter their second
year in the Big East and show the versatil-
ity and promise they need to contend for an
upper-division finish in 1996-97. Their
seven conference victories last year were
the second-greatest by any new school in
Big East history.

West Virginia Coach Gale Catlett
returns four starters and nine letterrnen to
the squad that finished 12-15 last year,
going 7-11 in the Big East conference.

Mountaineers leading scorer from last
year Damian Owens (14.6 ppg, 8.3 rpg)
will lead the way again as WVU’s go-to

guy. The 6-foot-5 junior also lead the team
in ﬁeld goal average (.513), blocks (32),
and steals (47). If the third—team all-Big
East selection stays healthy, WVU should
remain competitive for most of the year.

Gordon Malone (10.6 ppg, 6.5 rpg), a
6-foot-ll junior, will occupy the other for-
ward spot while senior Seldon Jefferson
(11.6 ppg, 5.2 assists) returns at point
guard.

Trying to take some of the offensive
load off the shoulders of Owens and
Jefferson will be senior center Sandro
Varejao (6.5 ppg, 3.7 rpg) and forward
Brent Solheim (6.9 ppg), a 6-foot-8 junior
who returns healthy after an injury-plagued
1995-96 season.

The West Virginia bench will feature
senior guard David Liguori (1.0 ppg),
junior guard Jarrod West (3.1 ppg), sopho-
more forward Shane Mallet (0.6 ppg) and

— , sophomore forward Tom Beynon (0.6 ppg)

-— all of whom will be looking to receive
more playing time.
