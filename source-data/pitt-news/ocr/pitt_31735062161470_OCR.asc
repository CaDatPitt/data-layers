Anonymous Faculty Grumbling

Hits Chancellor’s P

By DICK

(See editorial, “Pastures

KOVAR

Widespread rumblings from the faculty followed close
on Chancellor R. H. Fitzgera1d’s budget directive calling
for overload teaching elimination, reduced small classes, and
a hold-the-line policy on salaries last week.

Opposition to the measure, which also promised ‘every

effort’ to put through a general 106
per cent raise next fall, ranged
from mild concern to threats of
mass resignations. Objections came
mostly from the College and the
Schools of Business Administration
and Engineering, where overload
teaching is concentrated. Facul-

sional schools are relatively un-
affected by the measure, and re-
mained unconcerned.

The faculty's main objections
were:

1. The complete elimination of
overload, rather than the grad-
ual reduction called for by the
University Senate, represents too
sharp a cut in take-home pay.

2. The faculty was not consult-
ed on the measure, and it came
without warning,

3. The 10 per cent raise is not
definite, while the overload cut
is. Some faculty members feel
that a 10 per cent raise is not
enough.

4. The overload cut discrimi-
nates against the, undergraduate

schools, particularly individual

departments.

The dissension seemed to come
not primarily from the overload
cut but from the failure of the
school to make a deﬁnite, adequate
pay raise. The overload cut, it was
stated, merely worsens an already
bad situation. "

Manpower Heads Hold
Confab Here May 25  

_.Four of the nation’s top manpower authorities will be
here on May 25 to participate in a “Conference on Human
Resources and Higher Education.” .

Sponsored by the University, the conference will be held

in Stephen Foster Memorial fromé

9 a.m. to 4 p.m.

All students are invited to at-‘

tend.

Dr. Herbert E. Longenecker,
dean of the Graduate School, who
is making arrangements for the
conference, said its purpose will
be to call attention to the needs
of colleges in maintaining a con-
tinual ﬂow of trained personnel in
all ﬁelds.

National Authorities

Principal speakers will be Dael
I. Wolﬂe, director of the Commis-
sion on Human Resources and Ad-
vanced Education, Dwight Chap-
man, executive director, Commit-
tee on Human Resources of the
Research and Development Board,
Department of Defense, Henry
Chauncey, president of the Edu-
cational Testing Service and, M. H.
Trytten, director,of the Ofﬁce of

Scientiﬁc Personnel, National Re-
search Council.

The Research and Development
Board, under which Mr. Chap-
man’s committee works, is in
charge of research for the three
armed services.

Pushed Draft Changes

Mr. Trytten, in addition to his
National Research council post,
has in the past been chairman of
Draft Director Lewis B. Hershey’s
advisory committee on deferment.
The recent changes in deferment
regulations came about chiefly as
a result of the recommendations
of that committee.

The theme for discussion in the
conference morning session will be
“Needs for Scientiﬁc and Special-
ized Personnel.” In the afternoon
it will be “The Supply of Human
Resources.”

‘Schenley Ballroom’ Awaits
Ghosts And Finishing Touches

By DON BRAVIN

The ghosts of three generations
of a prominent Pittsburgh family
may someday be found in the new
Schenley room, now nearing com-
pletion on the ﬁrst floor.

The room, to be used for sem-
inars and conferences, is ,being
decorated with the original pan-
eling, moulding, and chandeliers
from the ballroom of the old
Schenley m a n s i o n ‘ in Stanton
Heights.

The history of the room began
not with a man named Schenley,
but with a young English soldier
named James O’Hara.

Was Sent to Pittsburgh

Young O’Hara, according to
Stanton Belfour, director and sec-
retary of the Pittsburg Foundation,
came to Pittsburgh from England
during the Revolutionary War. He
was sent here to act as the supply
sergeant at old Fort Pitt.

Through the years, O’Hara rose
in rank to eventually become a
general. Along with his army

— career General O’Hara also had an

industrial career. He owned dis-
tilleries, brick plants, paper mills,
and other industrial plants. He
was, at that time, the wealthiest
man in the area.

The general’s daughter married
William Groghan Jr. The Grogh-

ans, of course, received most of the
O’Hara fortune. ‘
Daughter Eloped

Then in 1842, their 15-year-old
daughter, Mary Elizabeth, eloped
with a dashing 43-year-old officer,
Captain Edward Wyntham Har-

rington Schenley, of the British
Army. Capt. Schenley, at the time,
was AWOL from a British Foreign
Office post.

The Groghan’s forgave their
daughter, however, and built a 29-
room mansion for the Schenleys
on Stanton Heights in order to
entice Mary and Edward to live
in Pittsburgh.

But the Schenley Mansion or the
‘.‘Picnic Place,” as it was called,
was home to the Schenleys for
only three years. In 1863 they ret-
turned to England.

Though Mrs. Schenley died in
1905, the house and its 100 acres
of ground were kept open for vis-
itors until a few years ago.

Mansion Sold

Finally the house was sold to
William S. Miller, a local business-
man, who dismantled it to make
way for a housing development.
In 1945 the ballroom, too beautiful
to be destroyed, was donated to
Pitt.

The last remaining sections of
the mansion were destroyed by
fire in March, 1950.

_ rence Lee delivered a stirring

speech, asserting that faculty mo-

; tale had slumped as a result of

uncertainty and suspicion over the

- pay issue.

Following the meeting, the News

 ~'attempted to discover the faculty’s
point of view on the matter.

Its

publishing of the Chancellor’s

statement on the pay directive

Friday brought more than a dozen
calls from heretofore silent fac-
ulty members, who claimed that
the Chancellor had not presented

’ the whole story.

None, however, would be quoted

.» by name. “None of us,” declared
‘ one department head, “feel that we

can afford to be identified as ob-
jectors. That’s why so few of us

» dared to speak strongly at the Sen-

ate meeting.”
A College department head pre-

:, ‘sented the most sweeping argu-
 ment against the new policy.

Mass Resignations
He feared that mass resignations

C by instructors are imminent. “The
' younger men wonder just what
 the situation will be in the future
 -;'-if it remains up in the air, with
  deﬁnite plans, they will leave
~ 1 ﬁnd a living wage,” he pre-
jglicted. -

.Asked it’ reduced enrollment

load anyway, he retaliated, “The

 or by. administration edict

 not solve the problem of un-

qlerpayment. It is not even the
basic problem. As the President’s

-Committee on Higher Education

dated in 1947, ‘College teachers

5 should not have to choose between
.-being overworked or underpaid.’
 Owerload teaching was an excuse

tor not raising salaries in the ﬁrst
place.”
Cites Lack of Funds

‘  He disagreed with the adminis-

t_ra'tion’s assertion that reduced en-

mllment ‘next fall makes drastic

Salary Talks

9 Faculty concern over the cur-
rent wage uncertainty took a con-

_.erete turn last week, when de-
partment heads in the College met

informally to discuss the proposed
changes in faculty salaries.
‘ Discussion centered on the ef-
fect elimination of teaching over-
loads and -a possible 10 per cent
increase in basic pay would have
on the staff in College depart-
ments.

It was determined, according to

. two chairmen reached by the

News, that approximately 50 per
cent of College faculty is carry-
ing an overtime load. If a 10 per
cent increase in salary were grant-
ed next fall, the take home pay
of these people would be cut ap-
proximately 12 per cent, they said.
’ The general feeling among the
department heads was that it
would be unfair to cut away that
much of facultytake-home pay.

\ _ Further discussion determined

the extent of faculty in each de-
partment which would be affect-
ed by the. dropping of overtime
loads. In some, almost all mem-
bers were carrying one or more
ex'tra' classes, receiving up to 25
per cent of take home pay in this
way.

the size of the student body. What
assurance is there that a two- or
three-year wait will assure the
faculty ‘lit a higher salary then?
If we wait now, what good will
it do?”

Both he and others took issue
with the Chancellor's statement
that 160 out of 664 tenure faculty
are now carrying overload, and
that a 10 per cent raise would cost
the University $432,000.

Figures Confusing
On this basis, they pointed out,
the current pay of 664 faculty
amounts to $4,320,000, which di-
vided by 664 yields an average
salary of $6,605. This ﬁgure is far
above the actual average.

Confusing the whole picture was
the lack of available ﬁgures and
the many factors affecting esti-
mates of those carrying overload.
One department head estimated
that 45 per cent of the College
faculty carried overload, but Dean
Stanton C. Crawford offered ﬁg-
ures that showed only 32 per cent
of his teachers carried extra hours.

All those questioned agreed that
instructors will be the hardest hit,
and that many will either have to
seek jobs with private industry or
will be forced to take on part-time
jobs to supplement their present
salaries. Both measures would be
detrimental to the University, they
said, and would result in ‘academic
anemia.’

"What if he decides to give an oral exam?"

American universities are currently riding one of the
stormiest passages in their history. Many of them are weath-
ering the storm. Pitt isn’t. _ *
." Never since the witch-hunting of Chancellor Bowman’s
administration has their been more fear, more open dissatis-
faction among the faculty. Not since the war have students
faced such a drastic curtailment of teaching and services.

‘In short, the University is facing a major crisis. As far
as the administration is-concerned, the crisis has been re-
solved. The faculty have been told that they may receive a
raise. Some of them have been told deﬁnitely that they must
take a major cut. A few have been ﬁred. ,

The faculty, on the other hand, are anything but satis-
ﬁed. A number of them have sworn that they will quit. An

committing themselves. A few, like Wayne Dennis, George
Albee, Ralph Jensen, and Stephen Marshall, have already
sought and found greener pastures.

The Chancellor, who is ultimately responsible for the
conduct and policies of the University, has attempted to solve
the problem, but his solution is unacceptable to a large
number of his staff. , Not since he took over has he faced
greater opposition by them. \

In the midst of all this, the Board of Trustees, ostensibly
the Chancellor’s advisor and supposedly» the real policy—mak-
ing body, continues to meet for 45 minutes once every three
months to rubber stamp Dr. Fitzgerald’s proposals. Only
this year the Trustees managed to shirk their duties to the
extent of skipping one of their four meetings.

Pitt Beats Tech-At Last

Almost everyone seems agreed that Pitt’s ﬂoat parade on
Monday was far superior to the similar {extravaganza con-
cocted by our neighbors across the valley, Carnegie Tech.
Some even go so far as to maintain that Tech’s ﬂoat parade
was an out-and-out ﬂop. They hold that it is indicative of
Tech’s‘steady decline in the realm of vigorous student ac-
tivities. They hint that it may even indicate to an inner stag-
nation of the spirit which is onlyé

now coming to the surface.
These are strong words- and
they are rare words indeed. You

only hear Pitt come off the better
of the two in a comparison about
once in a generation. And then
the comparison usually applies to
football. Of ‘late that hasn’t even
been noised about.

Strange Talk c

To those unfamiliar with the
workings of the local educational
Main Street, this must seem
strange talk .A glance at the en-
rollment ﬁgures, plant facilities
and variety of courses offered
here at Pitt, seems to point to our
supremacy in all ﬁelds, as well
as a paramount place in the aca-
demic hierarchy.

But the contrary has been true.
Tech despite its small size has
held ﬁrst place both in the esteem
and the hearts of the collegiate
world in this district. It has been
placed on -a large and high
pedestal and it’s only rarely that
this position is disputed.

Few people will deny that Tech
has an excellent engineering
school and even fewer will ques-
tion the standing of its dramatics
curriculum. But there are many
who deny that excellence in two
ﬁelds is sufficient reason for de-
ducing excellence in all ﬁelds.
They might turn out good engin-
eers and surpassing actors, but

_'Supremacy Myth’

they do not necessarily produce
the best all around specimens of
manhood and maidenhood.

People being what they are this
illusion has been carried through
the years." Even Pitt students dis-
play a sort of servile acquiescence
to the theory.

They yearn for the real college
life as exempliﬁed by conditions
on the Tech campus. They seem
to think that there across Forbes
Street is the kind of romantic life
they read about in the little boy’s
books when they were in seventh
grade. You know; the football
hero who has clean-cut eagle
scout friends, who never smokes
and always goes to Sunday school
where he teaches an advanced
class, who squires around at chaste
maiden whose lips “have never
touched liquor.” Ah yes, you

competition. )

(The Pitt News presents the following tall tale by senior Andy
Schurman. The board of judges has awarded it first prize in the

By ANDY SCHURMAN
Word of Pitt’s coming West was received by my great-

grandfather, Andy Lie,‘ back in Pittsburg, Kansas in 1851.
His son, Andy Jr., my grandfather, likes to tell how old
Bob Lyles, the pony express rider, called the news out to
great-grandfather that he should start clearing his cornﬁelds

as the University of Pittsburgh wase —

moving out that away.

This may be as good a time to
tell a little about my great-grand-
father.

Like Hugh Henry Brackenridge,
who, I believe, founded the Acad-
emy in Pittsburgh which later be-
came the University of Pittsburgh,
g r e a t - grandfather was also a
pioneer lawyer with a Bracken-
ridge sense of humor.

He left word in his will that he
was to be buried under the Var-
sity Tree out by the old Varsity
Walk. Also, he stressed that his
name was not be in inscribed on

the tombstone. Instead of his name,
great-grandfather Andy Lie asked
that the inscription “Here Lies an
Honest Lawyer” be substituted.
His thought was that everyone
would naturally say, “That’s a
Lie.” \

However, that isn’t the reason
for my story. Great-grandfather
was not one to let grass grow
under his feet. As soon as Lyles
let it be known that Pitt was com-
ing West, great-grandfather start-
ed to clear the cornﬁelds to make

‘room for the Cathedral.

The corn wagons with their high

    
 
  
 
  
   
  
 
  
    
 
 
  
 

Sideboards were brought into, n"
ﬁelds, and the husking began.
This is the most fascinating -
of the story. Grandpa just loves
tell how great-grandfather, in'- t
ing the ears of corn against .
high sideboard of his wagon wr
America’s greatest song.

It seems that the old-lawy
farmer, while hastily ‘clearing
way for the Cathedral, tossed
ears of corn in such a snappy m
ner, that as the ears struck
wagon’s sideboard, the tune
"Hail to Pitt” rolled out.

However, grandfather’s s t o‘ it;
doesn’t end at this point. W7

Tv Tussle Ahead  

 

Kukla, Fran and Ollie may never reach Pittsburgh.

The Federal Communications Commission is now being
swamped with petitions asking that one of Pittsburgh’s re-
maining two unallocated TV channels be used for non-com-

mercial, education purposes.
These petitions come from 33 ed.-
ucational institutions covering the
tri-state .area.

Also petitioning’ the FCC are
seven commercial stations that
want the two channels for com-
mercial purposes. Their main ar-
gument is that Pittsburgh should
have more than just two stations.
The Chamber of Commerce claims
that the FCC is “discriminating”
against the Golden Triangle.
Commercials vs Colleges

If the educational institutions,
of which Pitt is one, win out,
Pittsburgh will have only two
commercial stations—the present
Dumont and the one of the seven
applicants to which ' the FCC
would grant the channel.

It the commercial applicants
win out and get both channels for

\ ‘ A ' '

ant means of educating those
people who don’t have the advan-
tage of-attending a college. It
boils down to this: Pittsburgh
loses either way.

That doesn\’t have to be the
case, however. Some practical
compromising on each side could
solve the problem to almost every-
body’s satisfaction.

Simply divide the time of the
channel between the two inter-
ests. This would appease the
commercial interests somewhat,
and, even more important, solve
most of the problems of the edu-
cators.

Cecconi, Jones

Almost Upset Varsity

By DON MURDOCK

The Pitt Varsity and Old-Timer Spring Festival Bowl
game on Saturday went over so big that it will probably
become an annual affair to terminate spring grid drills.

In case you haven’t heard the Varsity dropped the un-

conditioned Old-Timers, 13-0.

After seven weeks of practicing the Varsity was sup
posed to run roughshod over the poorly conditioned Old-
Timers, but Johnny Chickerneo’s.W"

old men didn’t follow the script
and just about turned the tables.
Cecconi Best

The Old-Timers were helped
considerably by the presence of
Pvt. Lou (Bimbo) Cecconi, who
arrived at the Stadium from Camp
Pickett, Va. on a weekend pass.

Little Bimbo was the best look-
ing runner on the ﬁeld until he
was injured in the third quarter
which prompted coach Luby Di
Meolo to say, "Don‘t worry, Bim-
bo, they’1l discharge you when you
get back.”

Just before the game Alumni
guard Mike Boldin remarked, “We
had one practice, we’re overtrain-
ed.” In fact the Old-Timers had
to play with a twelfth man who
carried cards with plays listed.

Weak Pass Defense

As ‘the game progressed these
cards turned out to be a joke-
for the Varsity. When things bej-
gan to backﬁre for the Varsity, the
Old-Timer bench began to ride
quarterback Bobby Bestwick by
advising him to use cards too.

Offensively several Panthers
looked good. Billy Reynolds, Bob-
by Epps‘, and Lou Cimarolli will

collaborate on the tackle. Converging on the play
are Leo Skladany (80) and Nick Bolkovac (72).
On the ground to the left of Lee is Old-Timer Earl

 Co.

bear watching and the catching
ability of Chris Warriner will
cause Pitt’s opposition plenty of
trouble next season.

But the Varsity’s old nemesis—
pass defense——is still glaring. The
Varsity couldn’t stop the old pro
Edgar (Special Delivery) Jones.
When one realizes that neither
Jones nor his receivers had any
practice before hand, one begins
to wonder how the Varsity will
react to passing attacks next fall.

Schoolboys Entertained

After the game both squads
were guests of the Varsity Letter-
man’s Club at the Stanton Heights
Country Club. Also present at this
affair were more than 20 high
school football players.

Among these schoolboy football-
ers were two of the city’s best
backﬁeld products—halfback Joe
McCabe of North Catholic and Joe
Moore, fullback from Schenley
high school, the City League foot-
ball champions.

Also present was Rudy Mattioli
of Har-Brack, who was named on
the All-American high school
football team as a T formation
quarterback.

Varsity Day Program
To Honor Lettermen
Awardees Tomorrow

By BORIS

WEINSTEIN

Tomorrow is Varsity Day.
This year’s program during Spring Festival Week is a

new one to Pitt students, wh

0 will join the entire Pitt ath-

letic family to honor the school's athletes.
Presentation of awards will begin at 1:30 p.m. under
Varsity Tree——-the ﬁrst elm tree on newly-designated Var-

sity Walk.

All Panther athletes will be
wearing varsity sweaters and blue-
and-gold ribbons. Lettermen are
reminded to pick up their ribbons
at the Student Desk tomorrow
morning.

First Hartwig Trophy

Highlights of the program will
be the presentation by Dr. Norman
C. Ochsenhirt, chairman of the
Athletic Committee, of the ﬁrst
annual Charles C. Hartwig Me-
morial Trophy to “the senior who
has done the most to promote the
interests of athletics at the Uni-
versity during his college career.”

Also to be presented ‘to Pitt
annual
awards——to the Outstanding Ath-
lete of the Year and to the athlete
who has maintained the highest
scholastic average along with his

athletes will be two

athletic achievements.

The Hartwig Trophy will be pre-
sented in honor of the former Pitt
All-American guard of 1933-34,

who died last June at his West

Virginia home following a long;

illness.

Dean Vincent Lanfear of the
School of Business Administration
will make the presentation.

Bimbo, Award Winner

Lou (Bimbo) Cecconi received
the Outstanding Athlete of the
Year 1949-50 Award between
halves of the Varsity-Old Timers
game Saturday from Dean Lan-
fear.

Tomorrow's recipient will re-
ceive the plaque from Dr. Och-
senhirt. Dean Lawrence Van Kirk
of the School of Dentistry will
present the award to the athlete
who has maintained the highest
scholastic average. '

According to Andy Schurman,
representative of the Lettermens

'|Club, the names of the two win-
ners will be chiseled into Varsity
Walk—the walk parallel to ODK
Walk.

Editor

Den Casanova’s varsity didn’t make too much of an
impression on the Old-Timer gridders last Saturday—and
for that matter, they didn’t make an impression on anyone.

As one old-timer put it, ‘‘If that’s the Pitt varsity, I pity

them next fall.”

.;nother remarked after the Varsity had been pushed

all over the ﬁeld, “When’s Cas

going to put in his ﬁrst team?”

And the fans voiced their dis-
pleasure‘ at the showing of the
{Varsity with such comments as
“Bring back the single wing” and
‘We want Milligan.”

Same Old Bugaboo

Certainly the play of the Var-
city left much to be desired. Their
defensive play was ragged—espe-
cially their old bugaboo, pass de-
hnse.

At that, the Varsity was
lucky to score the ﬁrst touch-
down, as Billy Reynolds’ 90-
yard punt return was made
when Pitt Jayvees were in
the Old-Timer lineup. ‘
About the only Varsity bright

spots were the passing combina-
tion of Bob Bestwick to Chris
Warriner, and the running of the
two freshmen backs, Bobby Epps
and Lou Cimarolli.

Varsil-y Needs Cards. Too

The Old—Timers used a 12th
1nan—Sam Haddad—-with charts
outlining their plays. Which
prompted Mike Boldin, Old-Timer
guard, to remark to‘ the punchless
varsity, “Better get out your cards,
mo’?!

The Old-Timers didn’t stick
to the cards all the time.
however. Edgar (Special De-
livery) Jones was all for
scrapping the cards, and on
several occasions called the
play, “Get out for a pass.”
Jones and the last-minute ar-

rival, Lou (Bimbo) Cecconi, were
the spearheads of the Old-Timer
attack. When Cecconi was in-
).u‘ed in the third quarter after
Ieturning a punt 45 yards, it
marked the turning point of the
game.

Netters Face

Tartans Today

Pitt’s tennis squad takes on its
Oakland rival, Carnegie Tech, to-
day on the Tartan courts.

The Panther netters lost to

‘Denver, 5-1, in a home match on

Monday, bringing their season’s
record to 4-5_

Over the weekend, the Panthers
lost a tough one to Notre Dame,
5-4. Pitt held a 4-2 lead over the
Irish as doubles play got under-
way, with John Lohstoeter, Harry
Campney, Joe Bendel, and Bob
Ilisevich accounting for wins in
the singles matches. _

The Panthers needed to win
only one doubles event to clinch
the match, but it wasn’t in the
cards as the Irish swept the re-
maining three matches.

It was the second win of the day
for Notre Dame as they white-
washed Duquesne in the morning,
9-0.

Campney and Ilisevich with rec-
ords of 7-2 and Lohstoeter with a
6-3 record continue as the top-
ranking Panther netmen.

Last Friday’s match with Ge-
neva was cancelled because of

Libraries Work Double
Duty As Sleeping Rooms

By CLARK SUTTON
Staﬂ Reporter

From Bangor to Bangkok people pay others for the
privilege of sleeping. Everywhere, that is, except in Pitt’s

libraries.

The question of what to do with sleepers taking up

valuable reading room, how to
handle those ‘who snore, those
who sleepwalk-—these all are part
of running the library, apart from
lending books and collecting ﬁnes.

Alldred Offers Ease

A good example is the Alldred
Room. It’s no worse, nor any bet-
ter than the other rooms, but some
say it has the most comfortable
chairs. In a single afternoon, 12
out of the 30 seats will be occupied
by limp looking students comfort-
ably settled in the arms of Mor-
pheus.

Mrs._ Helen F. Dice, Alldred
Room librarian, has to deal with
it every day, but, like the rest of
the librarians, she lets the sleepers
alone unless they snore too loudly.

It wasn’t too long ago that one

‘student asked Mrs. Dice to waken

him “at 10:30 sharp, or I’ll miss

my class . . . again.” A
The "average Alldred napper

minutes, but there have been

some exceptions. The somewhat
dubious claim to sleeping in the
library the longest goes to a grad-
uate by the name of’ Fred Zuber.
He proudly states that to his
knowledge no one has topped his
record of “four hours and twenty
minutes.” -

Of all the University libraries,
however, the Periodical Room on
the ﬁfth ﬂoor is the one most
avoided by students looking for a
place to sleep.

Old hands at the business claim
there is too much distracting lit-
erature, such as Colliers, Esquire,
and the New Yorker.

The books in the other rooms-
Philosophy Through the Centuries
is a good example—do not require
their immediate attention.

Far From Madding Crowd

Professional slumberers suggest
that students avoid those rooms
where someone is always looking
for books. They will invariably
discover their prize right behind
your chair and request you to
move on.

They also suggest that you re-
frain from sticking your legs out
into the corridors.

Taking a somewhat different
view of the situation is University
Librarian A. L. Robinson. He feels
that the problem of sleeping in the
University Libraries is “not a bad
one.” He—has never given orders to
have students awakened and toss-
ed out, and doesn’t intend to un-
less there is a mass migration to
the library rooms. “As long as
they don’t keep readers out of the
seats, we won’t worry too much
about it,” he said.

Sexes Differ

Sleeping in the library seems to
be a pastime generally more fav-
ored by the men than the women.
Male students usually outnumber
the women by 6 to 1.

But the fact that they both do
sleep in the libraries causes its
own problems. A young couple,
going rather steady, suddenly dis-
covered that they both favored
one particular room for a quick
cat nap.

“Oh,” the young lady said to
her friend during an evening at
home. “I think it’s a wonderful
place to sleep, don’t you?”

“You bet,” he quickly agreed.

He was immediately ejected
from the house by her eavesdrop-
ping parents. The two now conﬁne
their visits to the Commons Room,
where sleep is out of the question.

This challenge was thrown at us by a
leading automobile maker.
“It’s possible,” we agreed. But . . :
the clutch housing also supports half
the engine’s weight, it is highly stressed,
must absorb vibration. Could a die cast-
ing economically be made that strong?
An Alcoa Development Program was
started. With the auto maker we drew
up designs. We sélected our strongest
die casting alloy; poured sand castings
from it; machined it to the dimensions

of the die castingdesign.

Shear static loads and bending
stresses were measured. Brittle lacquer
and strain gauges showed us stress con-
centrations. Castings, engine and trans-
mission were assembled, then run with

an unbalanced shaft to
namic stresses.

With the auto maker we modiﬁed
designs. Die castings were made. We
repeated the laboratory tests while the -
auto maker made road tests. The ﬁrst
stressed automotive. die casting was a
success. 25% stronger in shear, 10%
stronger in bending, 100% better in
fatigue life than the original clutch
housing. Only 34 as much weight as the
original cast-iron housing. And 15%

This case is typical of the engineer-
ing problems Alcoa men undertake and
solve. Throughout the Alcoa organiza-
tion similar challenging jobs are in

, progress now and others are waiting for
the men with the'imagineering ability
to tackle them.
