“John Reed King Talent
Team” in the SU Ballroom
next Wednesday at 8:30 p.m.
Admission is free and re-
freshments will be served in a
nightclub atmosphere.

John Reed King, local TV-star,
hosts for the ﬁrst show in this
musical series. His talent team
includes folk singers Liz Seneif
and Al Homberg, and the “Har-
mona—Kings,” a jazz group.

Liz Senelf has performed in the
Hollywood Bowl and at the hun-
gry i. Recently she, appeared on
television’s Hootenanny. Her new-
est album of songs, Now Listen

28 other institutions and in-
dividuals were also named to
share a trust fund with the Uni-
versity . totalling. speciﬁc dollar
legacies of $420,000.

Orphans Court Judge Hugh C. H
Boyle, in his decree of distribu- .

tion of the estate, assessed the
"taxes proportionately against
the University and the 28 other
beneﬁciaries.

Six of the beneficiaries appealed
the decree, however, contending
that the real “residue” of the
estate was not that part com-
prised in the trust fund, but the
final balance given to the Uni-
versity.

Court Upholds Claims

The Supreme Court upheld this
claim by the beneficiaries, and
reduced the University's share of
the trust fund, which had origin-
any been $524,000, to $302,000.

Among those appealing to the
High Court were the U.S. Li-
brary of Congress and the

Koussevitzky Music Foundation,
who divided a $50,000 legacy.

originally assessed, the Univer-

Cyprus Debate In Custine’s

A Turkish National and a Greek Cypriot will contest
the very lively, “Cyprus Question” in the backroom of
““Gustine’s”, on Wednesday evening at 8:30. Miss Neylan
Akra and Alkis A. Kantos will debate the Turk and Greek
. ‘C Cypriot viewpoints respectively, in a confrontation sponsor-
. ‘ed by the International Relations Club.
' Miss Akra, who comes from,Istanbul, Turkey, received
her undergraduate educaton at¢

Wellesley College and is present-
ly a teaching fellow working to-
wards her doctorate at the Grad-

"uate School of Public and Inter-

national Affairs.
Kantos comes from Nicosia,
Cyprus. Currentlyiworking for his

‘doctorate in Political Science, he

holds a barrister of law degree

from England, and a Masters from
GSPIA at the -University.
Fighting Erupts

Fighting erupted between the

Greek and Turkish communities
on Cyprus in December 1963,

' when Archbishop Makarios, pres-

ident of the island, announced
proposed Constitutional changes.
The‘ Turkish minority felt these
proposed alterations would destroy
their legal protections. The Greek
community feels that its indepen-
dence is violated by 1960 laws
which Makarios’ changes would
amend. .
The Turks wish to maintain
their own administration for
39% of the island. The Greeks
oppose such a partition.
The debate wil consist of for-
mal exposition and cross exami-
nation periods, folowed by an

open question session.

Trackmen  
Lose Meet,
DelVecchio

By FRANK SMIZIK *
One loss after another was
the sad story for the Panther
track team as they bowed to
Ohio University ,atA_t____he Sta-
dium Saturday, 65-57. The tragic

Panthers not only "lost . in‘ score,
but they are now missing 0-their
topsprinter Bill ' ' 
DelVecch_io. A
The low point.

  

in the 22_0—yard
dash. First Del-
Vecchio o n 1 y’;
made it as’. far
asithe‘ turn be-
fore he aggra-
vated a ham-
string‘ inj u r y C1-out
and had to drop out. Dick Crout
then went on to win the race but
was disqualiﬁed for moving into
another runner’s lane. A

The_ happenings in the 220
overshadowed some of the ﬁnest
performances of the year ’for the
Panthers. John Bailey ran the
fastest mile in nine years at Pitt,
4217.1, ‘although he ﬁnished third

 

who was clocked in 4216.9

In the 880-yard run Don
Hinchberger turned in his best
time this season, 1:56.4. He also
only ﬁnished third as Barry
Sugden of Ohio took ﬁrst in
1:5_2.3. _ .
The -mile relay team turned in
outstanding performances despite
the absence -or -DelV\ecchio. Joe
Friend turned the fastest leg by
doing the quarter ~in'48.0. “Friend’s
performance was especially.not—
able since he competed in -three
events previously,” ,. said coach
Carl .Re‘es. , ,_ ,
Friend won the 120-yard high

while Luddy Hayden” took a sec-
ond in the 120-yard high hurdles
and _a first in the broad jump.
Friend was four-tenths,of a sec-
ond off the 440-yard hurdles re-
cord set by Tom Bedick of Penn
Statelast year. Hayden is still not
at full strength because ofa ham-
string injury.

Both Pitt sprinters Crout and
DelVecchio had taken ﬁrsts be-
fore the running of the 220.
DelVecchio ran 9.8 for the 100-
yard dash and Crout won the
440-yard ’dash in 49.1. Jim
Studnicki also took a second in
the same race.

Ohio was especially weak in the
ﬁeld events and the Panthers took
full advantage of it. A1 Thomas-
sey had ﬁrsts in the shot put and
the" discus while Mort Stanﬁeld

Roger Johnson pitches for the Panthers tomorrow at
3:30 pm. at Forbes Field in an attempt to avenge Saturday’s

loss against the Mountaineers

West Virginia, now 23-3 and 
headed for the NCAA tournament ='_

as the‘ Southern Conference cham-
pionscored their only run with
two outs in the fourth inning
against starter Da__ve Blyshak
Steve Berzansky singled, and

 

V scored when Bob Munchin hit as
 double to right ﬁeld.‘

-' , Can't Score
The Panthers had runners on
second base and third'base twice
in the game, ‘but were ‘unable to
score against the Mountaineers’

pace lefthander John Radosevich.

“Radosevich was tremendous,”
coach Bobby Lewis said in tribute.
“He had a good ‘fastball and a
good curve. He seemed to put the
hall where he wanted to, and we
couldn’t hit him.”~ _

Radosevich struck out 16 Pan-
thers in gaining his ninth win of
the season against one loss. He
gave up"ﬁve hits. » ‘

Blyshak Loses

Panther lefthander Dave Bly- I

shak gave up ﬁve hits in losing
his second game of -the season
against three wins. “Blyshak
pitched well enough to win,”
Lewis said. “He only gave up one
run. '

“He lost because we weren’t
hitting,” Lewis said. “You have to
score af least one run to win a
ball game, and Blyshak has pitch-
ed in the last two games where
we were shut out. In those two
games (Syracuse, 2-0, and West
Virginia) he has given up a total
of three runs. But it hasn’t been
good enough.”

The Panthers now stand 5-7,
having lost six games by one run,
and one game by two runs. Lewis
blames poor hitting for the lack
of results. “We’r.e not hitting at
all. Our team batting‘ average is
around .224 and that’s not going
to win many ball games.”

Despite the Panthers’ lack of
hitting, however, Lewis still has
something to rave about: catcher
Doug Chambers’ rightarm. Cham-
bers threw out Mountaineer cen-

terﬁelder Jim Marovic twice try- .
ing to. steal. Marovic has 27 steals '

in 26 games, and was-out to break
a record against the Panthers; But
the leading collegiate base stealer

in the country will have to wait-

had his best day at the "Sta-
dium with a first and two thirds.

Stanﬁelds ﬁrst in the high jump
emphasized the Ohio weakness in

that event. He and Jim Murray

both‘ only jumped 5-feet-8-inches
but Stanﬁeld had less misses. His
two thirds came in the pole vault
and in the discus.

Loses Twice

The Panther tennis team
stretched its seven record to 1-6
this weekend, by losing to West
Virginia and Carnegie Tech. The
9-0 loss to West Virginia marked
the fourth match in which the

netters have been shutout, and the .
2 points scored against Carnegie‘

Tech brought the Panthers season
total to 12 points as against 51
for their opponents. '

The shutout by West Virginia

was-a surprise to coach Ben Pope. .

and the tenni-siteamﬁ because they
had only lost to the Mountaineers,
6-3', a week ago. ’

The only points the netters

_scored against Tech were in two
doubles matches. Dave Orth team-,

ed with Adrain Hartman /and Joe
Guzzardi teamed with Tom Bar-
ber to cop the Panthers’ only wins.
Barber, Orth, and Guzzardi have
won two doubles a_nd singles
