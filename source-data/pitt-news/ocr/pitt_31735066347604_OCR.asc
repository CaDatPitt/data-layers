No Need To Be Sick

BY DAVE McDONALD

“There goes the University again, tacking extra fees onto our
invoices,’ ’-groaned many a Pitt student upon learning of the mandatory
$16 Student Health Service fee, now in its ﬁrst year.

“I never get sick, so why should I have to pay the fee?” complained

others.

For some student consumers-by-invoice these may be legitimate
gripes about the new program, but a closer look into the Brackenridge
offices-of the health service reveals the $16 can go a long way and that
the services offered include more than just tending to the sick and dying. -

' Dr. Joanne Robinson, health service director, says, “We are a

 
  
 
 
 
  
  
 
   
 
  
  
   
  
  
    
 
    
 

cost-conscious quality health ser-
vice,” and explains that service
includes acting as the students’
health educator, curing the sick,
preventing disease and even
getting out to the potential patient.

The main tie between the clinical
and educational aspects of the
service is health educator Gerald C.-
Hyner. “In the health education
area we are involved in reaching out
to the University community,
particularly in the areas of family
planning and predictive medicine.

“We aren’t the type of service
that hands your pills to you and

 sends you out the door—not that the

hospitals do that,” he said. “We

make it a point to explain everything
thoroughly so students can learn
what is right for their. bodies, and
why we are doing what we're
doing.” A

Part of what the health service is
doing is spending $700,000 annu-
ally, $500,000 of which is supplied
via students’ $16. The University
appropriates $200,000 to the health
service, which has had 22,000
student visits since July, 1976.

service is that of general medicine
——the same types of simple ofﬁce
routine practiced by family doctors.
Under this category fall such items
as tonsil checks and annual
check-ups. '

Right behind general practice is
gynecology. Female patients at the
health service can expect the same
care they receive from their regular
gynecologist. Also available are
family planning information and
supplies of all forms of contracep-
tives.

Student response has been about
equal between male and female
engineering students, Snyder
added.

“It’s mostly engineers up here
already and I_mostly hang out with
them,”
Hopkins, an engineering student

who lives on nine and plans to —

return. “All my friends will be up
here.”

The reduced visitation units are
located in some Brackenridge suites
and Tower.B’s_second floor. Each
suite or ﬂoor is responsible for
deciding visitation‘ hours—a sort of
self regulation process.

“They don’t’ always follow these

0 to the letter,” Snyder observed.

“The discriminating factor is that
it’s a group decision.” '
-Coed, ﬂoors are generally viewed
suspiciously by other students as
well ~ as outraged parents and
ministers. In actual practice, they
are probably the most successful of
all the alternative lifestyle units—-

and not because they consist of

continuous orgies, as some suspect
(or hope).- Pitt’s coed units are
floors 18 and 19in Tower B and the
10th floor at Lothrop. .

“I don’t see any different
complaints from the coed ﬂoors as
from the regular ﬂoors,” Snyder
said. “l’ve heard virtually no

‘ complaints, on sexual problems.”
Students residing on~ the coed-
. floors are offeredlspecial one-credit;

Snyder said. Topics covered
include discussions on morality,

sexual awareness and rape.
“lt’s kind of like the coed ﬂoor is

, the ideal prototype of community,”

Snyder said. “Their area is usually
quieter, there’s a lot more mutual
respect and there’s a lot, more
interaction . ’ ’

“I guess one of the big

large number of freshmen on the"

incoming freshmen were informed

of their unusual living arrangement '

and were given a choice about living

As the year went on and cases of
freshmanitis cleared up, the
situation improved considerably,

Most inoonvieniences are minor.

. Freshman Mike Anthony said it was

irritating when “guys come up to

security door. If it were an all-guys

And there are times parents see a

Counseling Clinic To Open

BY HELENHAKY,

What do you do if you’re a
pregnant student? Or if you think
you have V.D.? Or if you need
contraceptive advice? One place
with answers may be Planned
Parenthood’s new clinic The Caring
Place, scheduled to open this
Saturday.

The clinic, located at Planned
Parenthood’s downtown center, will
be a Saturday extension of regular
services and limited to teenagers
and college students, according to

Planned Parenthood spokesman,
Chris Mayer.

Although pregnancy counseling,
venereal disease screening and
contraception information may be
obtained through-both the regular
center and the new clinic, Mayer
said more personalized attention

‘ will be given at The Caring Place.

She cited rap sessions in small
groups as one way the personal
touch can be added.

“Trained leaders will head these
discussions on unlimited topics like
parental attitudes and pressures,”
Mayer continued.
friends of clinic visitors are welcome
to join these sessions, she said.

“The Caring Place will also
provide in-depth education on a
range of sexual topics,” Mayer
said. Subjects listed at Planned
Parenthood’s Resource Center
include homosexuality, rape, abor-
tion and venereal disease.

“Young people are starved for

and
Smcllyllce oamehmewm'

this type of information because
they just don't get it anywhere
else,” Mayer said, adding this was
a fnajor reason for opening the
Saturday clinic. '

Because Saturday is the most
convenient day for high school
students, Mayer urges college
students to also visit Planned
Parenthood other days during the
week to take advantage of their
services. Mayer suggested calling
first for an appointment.

Planned Parenthood works for
both sexes and all information is
conﬁdential, Mayer said. Three
major services offered by the
downtown center include early
abortions, contraceptives and
counseling.

Early abortions are performed on
an outpatient basis, according to a

Planned Parenthood pamphlet. The "

procedure can be done as early as 10

days after pregnancy is suspected
and conﬁrmed. An individual
interview with a counselor is an
integral part of the service,
according to the booklet.

Counseling services are extended
to individuals and couples concern-
ing pregnancy. A full range of
alternatives are provided with
follow-up referrals to appropriate
resources, such as adoption facil-
ities. Counseling is also offered to
single and married persons on the
emotional, sexual and social aspects
of their relationships, including
sexual dysfunction and contra-
ceptive concerns. ‘-

Patients wanting contraceptives
may obt_a_in supplies from Planned

. Parenthood in person or by mail.

However, each new patient is given
a complete physical examination

MAC Clinic Held

The Medical Action Committee
(MAC) tested approximately 800
people at its biyearly’ free diagnostic
clinic, held Tuesday and Wednes-
day in the Student Union Ballroom,
according to clinic coordinator Sam
Mendicino.

“We treated between 700 and
900 people—I’d say about 800,”
Mendicino said. “We didn’t get as
many as we expected, possibly
because of the weather and
midterms.”

The tests, which were optional,
included blood pressure, blood
testing (hemoglobin, hematocrit
and glucose), hearing, vision,

EKG. Blood testing and urinalysis

Twas done by junior and senior

Medical technology students. The
American Cancer Society per-
formed pap smears. The American
Sickle Cell Society and American
Diabetic Society also participated in
the testing.

MAC’s Peer Medical Action
Program (PMAP) gave demonstra-
tions of cardio-pulminary resusita-
tion. '

“All of our members showed
up,” Mendicino said. “It was good
experience for them.” , I

The only variation from MAC’s
fall clinic was the omission of
syphilis testing.

Dreams, Complexities

By DAVID GASVODA

I arrived at Carnegie Lecture Hall at
five minutes to eight, after a day filled
with the stuff of “English”—attending
classes, writing. papers, reading books,
editing essays. _

Standing by the ticket desk clutching
my yellow pad and a pack of Juicy Fruit
gum, I was panic stricken: how does one
“review” poetry? By the time anyone
read what I had to say about the forum,
the poets would be gone, listening to
Mozart on headphones in the planes
going wherever they were going.

I broached the question to Ed
Ochester, an instructor in poetry at Pitt
whose class was attending the evening’s
“Lie outrageously," he
advised me, laughing. “Just make
something up.”

“Write up a beautiful, glorious,
glowing review to encourage people to
come,” chimed in Gar Bethel, another
instructor. “Anything to get people in
here; there's not -enough of them who
love poetry.”

A Inside, the lecture hall was perhaps
half-full—a motley crowd of 250 in suits
and furs to overalls and sweaters. Many
of the young people looked like students
and many of them I recognized as poets
whose work I had heard at campus
readings and read in local literary
magazines.

On stage, in the exact center of a ring
of bluish light projected from the rear,
was a simple wooden podium. Behind
that were three chairs, one for each of
the poets who were to read. Two of the
chairs were next to each other ,to the
right of the podium; the other was set off
to the left. I wondered if their

' Recently I hawked a poetry and fiction magazine at busy thoroughfares in the

Student Union and the Cathedral of Learning. I was, in a sense, selling myself by
selling my own work. I didn’t like the process, but publishing a magazine is an
expensive enterprise. I, and the rest of the staff, had no choice.

For those who do not believe that capitalism is corrupting, here is a record of my
changing attitudes during four hours of magazine bartering.

At first, my approach was soft and humble. I wanted to \ll.il€ good literature
with the kind passersby. .

One hour later: I refused to sell a magazine to someone who was three cents
short of the going price-. A . 4 » 3 .

Three hours later: Ioffered to make a fair deal. One of my magazines for a
“Militant” (a political weekly) and 15 cents.

Four hours later: “Artfor 50 cents,” I barked at potential customers. “Get
your poetry and prose here, folks. Literature for 50,” I said, “50 cents. Get it

Madison Avenue, I was on my way.

Art as an enterprise means two things: an artist who wishes IO share a work (as

we wanted to share our magazines)‘ may have to commercialize the vvori_(_ Ar‘.
tists with integrity, and with good works of art, may resist commercialization.
This means that you and I may never see their creations.

Secondly, artists with t little integrity may be more than willing to.sell any type
of work, regardless of its quality. Hence you and I are given an abundance of
access_to the stuff of which,Jacqueline Suzanne, Charles Bronson and Farrah
Fawcett-Majors are made: fluffly, superficial, entertaining, “easy” art. (That’s
where this editorial began, remember?). '

Fortunately, there are alternatives.

Unfortunately, you ‘and I _and the rest of the EAI membership (Easy Art
Inhalers, known otherwise as the mass audience, or the Nielsen family, or the
average consumer, etc.) would rather breathe easy than take on many of these
alternatives, some of which reside at our own campus.

I have never been inside the UP Gallery on Forbes Avenue. I have seen only two
Studio Theatre productions and three Mainstage productions.

Thepoint. is that one kind of art is fun; another is important. Fun art is offered
f0‘!-IS. In fact. Dushed at us, daily. Important art must often be sought out. After
it is found, it demands even more: thought, concern, and an open mind.

One kind of art IS passive. We experience it. It passes. It leaves nothing behind.

Another kind of art touches and holds and is insistent. It moves us. It makes us
consider.

A short woman with shiny, plastic--g

Much of Paston’s work revolves
around her experience of what it means
to be a woman, but to call it feminist
would be misleading. Working with the
simplest of images, she writes about

Almost as blatantly idiotic is “Rock

Health center staff said students
have complained about the dingy,
crowded reception area in which
they must wait. “We are doing the
best we can with the limited space
we have,” answers Dr. Robinson.
“With the large number of students
we have coming in we are pretty
busy at times, but we still try to give
everyone the individual attention
that health care requires.”

Other students’ complaints have
centered around the fact they are
seen only by nurses and not doctors.

What these visitors may fail to
realize, however, is that several of
the physicians are female and the
doctors are hard to spot because of
the informal atmosphere.

Also, most students don’t know
that it is wise to phone the service’
prior to a visit if a doctor is desired.
No phone call is needed, however, if
a nurse’s assistance is all that is
required. '

PHILADELPHIA-—The myth that
hiladelphia is a great basketball town
went down the drain Wednesday, as did
Pitt’s season, when West Virginia came
from behind to beat the Panthers, 66-54,
in opening round Eastern Collegiate
Basketball League Tournament action.
Part of an afternoon doubleheader,
the game was played before a non-crowd

%f 621, which had to include writers,

ushers, vendors and players. The crowd
of 3,616 for the evening doubleheader

was even less impressive, considering
that participants Villanova and Rutgers
are both located in the area.

What was impressive for a while was
the Pitt slowdown. The Mountaineers
(18-9) aren’t the same intimidating team
when they’re not racing up and down the
court and Pitt controlled the fempo of
the game.

Working very deliberately, and going
to the four corner offense when they had
a lead, the Panthers bounced back from
a 8-2 deficit to take an 18-13 lead.

Hobbled by injuries to Michael Rice,

George Plimpton became a “Paper Lion” to write his book on pro football; so '
what’s out of the ordinary about becoming a Panther to write hockey articles’?
Except for little kids pulling your tail and not-so-little kids pushing you around, it
is one way—there’s surely got to be some better ones——for a reporter to dig up his

scoops.

For the past three years 1 have reported Pitt hockey and during that same period
1 have broken all the rules of lce Capades etiquette while performing the role of
Pitt Panther hockey mascot. For the most part it is a thankless job, and until now _

‘Q':w people knew who was behind those sharp teeth and pierci yes ow at th

came in swallowing-.my..,'pri‘de—a feat easily accomplished due to the .sparseness of H
the hockey crowds-—and the submission of making a total jerk out of myselffor

the enjoyment of others.

“Everybody gets in goofy moods and likes-to be a total jerk once in a while,“
former football and basketball mascot Don Nixon, brother of current Panther
eith Nixon, once said. “But they hold back for fear of being seen. 1 don't have

 ‘ to hold back at anything. 1 can act weird and still look good. 1 enjoy putting one .

Once during the 1974-75 season. 1 inadvertently made several hundred people

Port Authority bus for the trip downtown, wearing my Panther outfit. Wishing to

trip back to Oakland.

The next season, the Pitt coaches coaxed me into donning the Panther outfit and
walking into a novieltyishow at the Arena exhibit where the guests just happened to
be Zora and Cornelius from “Planet of the Apes." Up on stage with the likewise
furry creatures, they thought 1 was part of the show, the people thought 1 was part

Kelvin Smith and Pete Strickland, the
outsized Cats needed to play 40 minutes
of said basketball with as few errors as
possible. lt didn’t work out that way.

When guard Scott Nedrow picked up
his third personal foul with Pitt ahead,
18-13, coach, Tim Grgurich picked up a
costly technical foul when he protested
the apparently legitimate call.

Mountaineer guard Bob Huggins sank
both free throws and when Maurice
Robinson broke free for a lay-up on the
ensuing inbounds play} the -'Pitt
breathing room -and momentum had
vanished.

With David Washington replacing
Nedrow, the Cats hung tough and made
it to the locker room with a halftime 27-
25 lead. Pitt’s only chance of winning
was for the _game to have ended righ
there. ‘

West Virginia came out jumping and
running in the second stanza. Robinson
controlled the opening tip-off, sending
Tony Robertson to the hoop with an
uncontested lay-up.

The Mountaineers continued to run on
the Panthers and built an
insurmountable 43-30 lead seven minutes
into the half by outscoring the Cats, 18-
3.

‘‘It was only a question of whether
they could keep the tempo down or we
could’ keep it up,” said WVU coach
Joedy Gardner, whose team beat Pitt for
the third time this season. “At the start
of the-second half, we got the tempo up a
little bit.”

“What we did in the first half was
exactly what we wanted to do the whole
game,” said Grgurich. “We wanted to
stay in the four corners offense and get
the ball to our shooters, Larry Harris’
and Sonny, Lewis.” .

Pitt’s failure in the second half was
attributable to several causes. The
Panthers committed 20 turnovers and 28
personal fouls,,and Harris and Lewis’

shots from the floor, while Lewis canned

' “You gotta stick ’em when you get the

said Grgurich: ‘‘In the second half, we

just had too many turnovers that we
shouldn’t have had. These are things
you just can’t do.”

Most of the Panthers were in foul
trouble, and when 6-1 1 Ed Scheuermann
was out, Robinson feasted on 6-1 Frank
Boyd, who wasforced to play inside
because of Pitt’s numerous injuries.

Robinson finished as the game’s
leading scorer with 26 points, most of
them coming from the inside. *7 Harris
paced the Panthers with 16 points, while
6-2 Wayne Williams, also pressed into
forward duty, was the game’s leading
rebounder with nine.

“l thought the University of
Pittsburgh played an intelligent game,”
said Gardner.. “We were trying to
penetratein the first half and they
wouldn’t let us.”

.“We knew if they got ahead by’ eight
or 10 it would hurt us,” said Grgurich.
‘‘In the second half we went into a man-

to-man defense and they isolated
Maurice Robinson. He’s playing
excellent basketball for West

Virginia—the best l’ve seen him-play in-
three years. He hurt us a great deal.”
Neither team would admit to being

phased by the microscopic crowd in the
sprawling Spectrum.

“The crowd had nothing to do with Z  ”

anything,” said Grgurich. “We knew
what we had to do. It didn’t bother us in
the first half.”

“We both had to play in the same
environment,” noted Gardner. “It was
strange, though. We have a lot more
people at most of our practices.”

There won’t be much practice for the
6-21 Panthers for a while. Their season
has mercifully ended, and they’ll
concentrate on increasing their strength
and recruiting to improve that record
next season. ‘ '

Young ECBL Tilts East

BY RON SIEGEL

Pl-llLADELPHlA— The Eastern
Collegiate Basketball League is only one
year old, but it already is suffering from
imbalance. Though upsets may make it
appear otherwise, the ,league’s Eastern
Division shines above the West.

The two Eastern Division games
played Wednesday night featured
obviously superior teams and more
exciting basketball. Following the
Western Division matinee, hard-core
basketball fans began to wonder if two
games weren’t enough for one day.

Pitt’s loss to West’Virginia was made
less exciting because of the slowdown

. tactics used by the Panthers. There was

no such excuse in the Penn State-
Duquesne contest, a game that
somebody had to win;'the Dukes did, 65-
55. '

The Lions-Dukes clash was blemished
by Duquesnefs shooting 40 percent from

;the floor while Penn State managed to '

connect 'on just 30 ‘percent of its

Jtttempts.» , .
Penn State sealed its own fate before

the game was IO minutes old. Hitting on
just five of their first 23 attempts, the
Lions lulled themselves (and the 621

fans) into a‘ 20-10 deficit 1'rom which

they never recovered.

Little-used Don Maser was the big
hero for the Dukes, who face
Massachusetts in a semi-final game
tonight at 7:00. Maser scored 11 of his
15 points and snared six rebounds in the
first half to spark Duquesne.

Penn State tried to battle back, but its
forward line had a miserable afternoon.
Walter Young, Chris Erichsen and
Carvin Jefferson madejust 10 of 38 field
goal attempts, and scored only 28 points

between them. we11,’be1ow_ their 47-point 

 

combined average. 

  

The Lions managed to pull to within
five late in the game, but Norm Nixon,
the Dukes’ All-American candidate

guard. began Sinking free throws to wrap
up the win. \

Nixon finished as the game’s leading
scorer with 18 points, while Erichsen
paced Penn State with 15.

“We felt we had to beat them on the
inside,” said 11-15 Penn State coach
-lohmly Bach.. “I didn’t think we could

and (Lonnie) McLain.”

With the cold shooting of the Lions’

inside men, the Dukes came away with »

their 13th win of the year in 27 starts.

The larger crowd anticipated for
-tonight sh_ould make things easier on the
Dukes. ~

“It's very difficult to go out and play
when you have no people,” said Nixon_
“Of course, Penn State was in the sam
boat we were in." ’

“The small crowd helps us because I
feel we can communicate some of the
intensity we want,” said" Duquesne
coach John Cinicola.

Most of that communicating is done
by Mike Rice, a Duquesne assistant
whose froglike voice could be heard
throughout the game. Whether any of
the Dukes listen to what Rice yells is
another story.

In the most exciting match of the day,
Massachusetts watched a 16-point
halftime lead disappear in five minutes,
then hung on for a 78-74 upset of
tourney-favorite Rutgers.

Led by hot shooting Mike Pyatt, who
led all scorers with 26 points, the
Minutemen shot 58 percent from the
floor to race to a 42-26 halftime lead.

The Scarlet Knights, NCAA quarter-
finalists last year, came out roaring in
the second half, running all over the
court and sinking a barrage of shots,
mostly crowd-pleasers.

With I4:52 left in the game, the score
was incredibly tied, 50-50.
Massachusetts refused to die, though,

hanging tough in the closing minutes to
pull off the win. '
When Alex Eldridge missed the front
end of a one-and-one with I8 seconds
left, Rutgers got the rebound and called

Rutgers coach Tom Young called for
Jim Bailey to get the ball underneath,
but guard Ed Jordan, who scored I6 of
his 22 points in the second half, fired up
a jump shot from the top of the key with
eight seconds left and missed.
Massachusetts controlled the rebound
and the game.

Asked after the game about the play
he called during the time out, Young
cried, “It wasn't the one we shot, that's

PGH’S AL ABRAMS DIES

PITTSBURGH (AP)—Al Abrams,
sports editor of the Pittsburgh Post-I
Gazette for 37 years, died Thursday at
the age of 73.

Abrams suffered an apparent heart
attack at his downtown apartment and
died en route to the hospital.

Semi-retired and a coltimnist with the
Post-Gazette, Abrams celebrated his
50th anniversary with the newspaper in
1975.

Known as “Mr. Dapper Dart,” he was
chairman and president of the Dapper
Dan Club, a charity group which
sponsors an annual sports banquet.

He was survived by his widow, Mary,
and two sons.

for damn sure. I don’t even want to talk
about it.”

Massachusetts coach Jack Leaman

was in a slightly better mood, his I8-9

Minutemen (Rutgers has an identical
record) having upset the Scarlet Knights
for the second time this season.

“All the thrills we had from Dr. J (U
Mass. graduate Julius Irving) couldn’t
match beating Rutgers twice in one
year," he said.

Leaman also was appreciative of the
Rutgers fast break.‘

“They have a picture perfect fast
break,” he said. .“I almost clapped
myself a couple times early in the second
half, ‘till I looked up at the scoreboard.”

In the other game Wednesday night,
George Washington fought back from
an ll-point halftime deficit to tie
Villanova, 70-70, only eventually to bow
to the Wildcats, 80-72. ’

Keith Herron paced Villanova with 24
points, while Les Anderson -led the
Colonials with 22.

In tonight’s games, Villanova plays
West Virginia at 9 p.m., while Duquesne
meets Massachusetts at 7 p.m.

Rock Stones Pitt, 65-60

* BY PATTY TASCARELLA

The Pantherette basketball squad
wrapped up the regular season at
Slippery Rock Tuesday night, but it ‘was
the Lady Rockets who rapped Pitt, 65-
60, in a contest Pantherette Coach Pat
Wallace termed as a “very anti-climactic
end to the season.” '

Seventeen minutes into.the first half,

Pitt managed only 12 points. At one.

time, the Rock had a 20-point edge. But
the Pantherette offense generated
enough effort to score 10 points in the
final three minutes to close the gap to 32-
22.

Pitt came back fighting in the second
half. Center Wanda Randolph scored
-most of her game-high 27 points in the
latter half, and with the Rocket
floorleader, guard Jody Gault, fouling
out in the fourth quarter, the
Pantherettes pulled within five pointsfor
the final verdict. I

I “It was too little too late,” Wallace
said of'the fourth-quarter effort. “We

  Ailing Matmen Hopeful  

BY MARK MURPHY

Just how badly have injuries wreaked
havoc with the Pitt wrestling lineup?

I Well, when the Panthers take to the mats

today and tomorrow in the NCAA finals
qualifier, they will have to go without a
wrestler in the 150-pound class. simply
because no healthy bodies can be found
near that weight. That‘s how bad the
injuries have become.

“We’ve just about depleted our
guys,” coach Dave Adams said. “Jim
Gordon (I58 pounder), Skip Bolin (167),
Bill Bailey (I90), Steve Carter (I34) and
Mark Stepanovich (heavyweight) are all
hurting. But they’re well enough to start
for us.”

Rounding out the Panther starting
Clark (ll8), Jose
Martinez (I26), Kim Smith (142) and
Don Arndt (I77) who, along with the

- others, will try to place in the top 26
‘ wrestlersand earn a trip, t_o;Norm_an,

 

 

Oklahoma, ‘ and the NCAA

championships March I7-I9.

Despite the casualties that will hamper
Adams‘ wrestlers and the injuries that
have already sidelined performers such
as All-American Rande Stottlemyer, Ed
Bredniak, Jackie Kline, Kevin
McNamara and Bruce Huggler, the l0th-
year coach still expects to take home his
fair share of qualifiers.

‘‘I would hope that we .'.ould do well,”
Adams said. “I'd be very disappointed
if we would qualify less than two
wrestlers. Being realistic, I have to say
that we could qualify four. We have a
couple of guys who could surprise us.”

Despite a 5-0 start, the Panthers could
do no better than a 6-6 regular season
record and a fourth-place finish in the
Eastern WrestlingLeague. After already
losing to tournament foes Penn State,
Clarion and Lock Haven, Pitt rates no
more than an outside" chance to take

‘home the tirst:placetrophy.,‘, .;_. _ 

‘wrestlers.

 

“Winning the tournament remains to
be seen,” Adams said. “We're going to
give it our best shot. Penn State has to
be the favorite and Clarion should run a
close second.” ‘

Besides injuries, a lack of tournament
experience could also plague Adams’
grapplers this weekend.

“No one else but Bill Bailey (an
NCAA Finals veteran) has tournament
experience," Adams explained.
“However, Jose Martinez is our most
improved wrestler and he has a chance to
do well, He is in a tough weight-class,
tough.”

For the past two weeks Adams has
been subjecting his grapplers to two-a-
day practices in an attempt to whip his
team into shape. All the practice time in
the world does not heal ailing bodies
however, and, when combined with little
tourney experience and first class
competition, it could add up to a long,
tough weekend for Adams and his.

  Ohio Grave-y Matter

For Panther lcemen

BY JIM PANE

The Pitt Hockey Club can add the
gravy to an already successful year with
a double win over Ohio University in its

season finale tonight and tomorrow in'~

Athens.

The Panthers, who have Yet t0 D05‘ 3
losing record in their six-year history.
take an 11-4-1 mark into the weekend

Cserjeg hoping for more than a Split

against the rugged Bobcats.

“We want both games,” head coach
Len Barcalow declared. ‘‘I’m not going
to say that we’ll blow them off theice,
but if we come out smoking right off the_

 bat, we’ll be all right.”

Barcalow stressed, however, that his
skaters must body check and stay in
position in order to have any success.

“We can’t let them freewheel like we

5./let Dayton do,” he warned. “We have

5 to hit this weekend.

lf a team doesn’t
check and stay in the lane, then it’s
hurting.” \

The Pitt and Ohio squads know all
about hitting each other——as anyone who
attended this year’s Pitt lnvitational will
attest. The bumpingand jostling for the
tournament championship began at the
outset and continued throughout a game
that featured» a capacity-filled penalty
box, a variety of fights, swinging sticks
and player ejection.

regionals."

' Pitt's bid to this year’s Eastern
Association for Intercollegiate Athletics
for Women’s (EAIAW) playoffs came
early this week. Last .year, the
Pantherettes won the consolation round
and received their invitation mainly
because they were the host school.

“We wanted to get an earned bid,”
Wallace explained, “and the fact that we
were seeded '(sixth) made it even better.”

Pitt’s schedule was extremely" strong,
with top-flight competition like Delta
lmmaculata. Also, the
majority of the games were played on the
road. Wallace said she was pleased with
the final results. ‘

“lt was an overall improvement,” she
said. “We're doing much better on
defense. We’re getting more scoring and
better floor play. I’m pleased with the
press—particularly the half-court press.
lt’s won quite a l'ew'games for us and
almost helped us to pull off the Slippery
Rock game.”

Still, consistency remains a problem

9:‘ and could figure prominently during the

playoffs. Plus, the Pantherettes

continue to commit a high number of .

turnovers.

Pitt remains one of the top
rebounding teams in the East (49.9 per
game) and the Pantherette defense is
formidable. A season's worth of
experience has tempered the freshmen
(“Our freshmen came on really strong

1 over thé'season,“ Wallace said) and with

veterans filling out the line-up, Pitt is
expected to do well in the post-season
competition.

Despite the melee, a hockey game was
played and it proved to be one of the
most exciting college games ever staged
at the Civic Arena. With the score
knotted at 2-2 and the Panthers skating
short-handed, left wing Tom Sherwin
broke in alone on goalie Rob Smith and
beat him with just over one minute to
play.

Although the Bobcats have had
various troubles that hampered their
performance this year, they proved to be
one of Pitt's most formidable opponents
and there is no reason to believe that this
time around will be any different.

‘ ‘‘They’re no .slouch,” Barcalow
maintained. “They’re well coached (by

player-coach Doug Ross) and have good

skaters, so we’ll have to pull our drawers
up, do some skating and some checking

and I’m confident that we’ll come home ,

’ And everyone knows roast beef goes
good with gravy. ‘

PANTHER PUCKS: Three Panthers
are in the race for the team scoring
championship. Bill Gedeon leads the
pack with 17 goals and a team-high 35
assists for a total of 52 points, followed
by Curt Hetz (26-21-47) and Tom
Sherwin (24-21-45) who are vying for the
goal scoring title.

Asked if Carnegie-Mellon and
Duquesne are included on next year’s
schedule, Barcalow answered, “it’s best

/The Panthers have been invited to
West Chester, New York to participate
in a tournament on March 26 and 27 but
their depleted budget may prevent them
from going. The tourney will include
teams from Penn State, Wagner and the
champion of the NCAA Division lll
Metro League, which includes lona,
Nassau, Rockland (who Pitt beat twice
this year), Ramp’apo, St. John’s and

BY BRUCE GERSON

Though senior Bob Arturo, a 5-10,
175-pound rough-playing defenseman
on the Panther hockey team, will be the
only player to graduate this year, he
leaves two holes to be filled—on defense
and in the office of club president.

“Being president of the club has been
a real pain at times, but it also has been a
great learning experience,” reflected
Arturo with mixed emotions. “I learned
things about administration and also

 

\

BOB ARTURO
about dealing with people. As an
administrator, when things go wrong,
you’re the one to get blamed, and when
things go right nobody notices you.”
Along with other club members, Bob
hopes the athletic department will soon
recognize hockey as a varsity sport to
relieve some of the administrative
problems. »
'As in the administrative position,
Arturo finds he is also overlooked, as
most defensemen are, on the ice.
“Being a defenseman in hockey is
more of a challenge to play than the right
or left wings or the center position,” he

1 said. “If you make a mistake everybody

notices it because it will most likely be a
costly one. However, if you make a

good play it is often overlooked.”

Although Arturo is not noted for his
scoring prowess——one goal and. seven
assists—he leads fellow defenseman Bob
Stein in their private scoring battle by
scoring a game winner against Cleveland
State. Third on the team in penalty
minutes, his most frequent whistles come
for roughing and elbowing.

Friday, March 4, 1977e1‘~Ir3i'iist=—P:.fi‘gt-.s"1»sl

Arturo Executive leer

"when you play defense you have I0
play rough,” Arturo said. “A defense-
man’s job is to clear people away from
the front of the net. An elbow in the ribs
or a stick in the back of an opposing
player will make him think about
standing in front of the net next time.”

Arturo started playing hockey on a
Longuevue Country Club pond in
nearby Penn Hills. After two years he
advanced to the, Pittsburgh Amateur
Hockey League for a season before
entering Central Catholic High School,
where Arturo won the most valuable
player award and was named team
captain.

While in high school, Arturo worked
in a school for exceptional children in
Oakmont. He came to Pitt with
expectations of majoring in special
education and facing stiffer hockey
competition. The icers’ ‘alternate
captain had to settle for a psychology

major and entered the child
"development-child care program to
satisfy his yearning to work with
children.

Currently the bearded defenseman is
working at the Three‘ Rivers Youth
Development Center where boys from
the ages of 13 to 18 gather.

“Adolescence is my special interest

     

131l;(iJ9@U1?1J [D

and I'd like to work with adolescents for
a few years after I graduate,” Arturo
said, adding he would like to return to
Pitt in the future for a masters in health
care administration. A semi-pro hockey
team might also make its way into
Arturo’s future, but he expresses
concern that it will interfere with his
work. ~ .

Hockey has left its marks on Arturo,
who was selected to the first annual Pitt
invitational All Star team in 1974, with
bruised hips and sprained ankles and
wrists.

“l’ve been going down and blocking a
lot of shots lately, something I learned
from Ricky Stein,” Arturo said._ “lt
hurts my hips and ankles. I’m glad’

trainer Bob Osborn is around. He keeps
me in one piece.”

According to the veteran, this year’s

Panthers were the most “together” and
talented of any past team. Practicing

only once or twice a week compared to"

other teams‘ daily workouts, Pitt still
holds a convincing 11-4-I record with
two games remaining against Ohio
University this weekend.

Arturo has been playing for Pitt for_

four years and he realizes this is his last.
“l’ll miss playing hockey very much,”
he said. “There was always a next year
but now there isn't."
