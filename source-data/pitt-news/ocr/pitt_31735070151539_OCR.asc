Correction: In an article published Sept. 10 in The Pitt News, it was reported that Monica Green, a history professor from Princeton University, referred to her ﬁeld of study
as “geneticism” and that she obtained most of the DNA for her studies from mummiﬁed remains. Both of these statements are incorrect. She referred to her ﬁeld of study as
genetics, and most of the DNA she obtained came from skeletal remains. The Pitt News regrets these errors.

Members of the Black Action Society came
together in celebration Thursday night to
introduce the release of their yearly maga-
zine, Blackline.

In honor of Indaba week, which is cel-
ebrated by the society at the beginning of
every school year, the party at the O’Hara
Student Center at 8:30 p.m. drew more
than 50 people. Indaba week is the coming
together of the organization in order to talk
about prevalent and current issues within
the community. The intellectual week has
continued since the club was founded.

“We wanted the black voice to be heard
around campus,” Black Action Society Pres-
ident Chandel Boozer, a senior majoring in
communication and rhetoric, said.

Boozer has been involved with the
group since she transferred to Pitt her
sophomore year.

Since its foundation in 1968, the or-
ganization has focused on spreading the
black voice throughout the community. The
historical establishment of the Black Action
Society at the University began with a ﬁght
between the school’s president and black
students to bring their voices forward.

When Black Action Society came to
Pitt in 1968 at the height of the civil rights
movement, 48 students locked themselves
in the Cathedral of Learning computer lab
and created a list of demands that aimed
to bring equality to.the black community.
After presenting this list to then-President
Wesley Posvar and insisting every demand
be met, the University ofﬁcially recognized
Black Action Society as an organization.

“It’s a welcoming week to the black com-
munity,” Boozer said of Indaba week. “A
meeting of the minds.”

The Black Action Society celebrate the release of its monthly magazine Thursday evenig. Th event included a demonstra-

tion of martial arts. Theo Schwarz | For The Pitt News

“It’s a great way to express creativity,”
society co-chair Breanna Durham, a senior
writing major, said.

Blackline, the group’s publication, is run
and written by the members of Black Action
Society as well as other students outside
of the organization. Published monthly,
copies are always available in the organi-
zation’s ofﬁce located on the sixth ﬂoor of
the William Pitt Union. A

“We wanted to keep it student—based
to showcase the talent on Pitt’s campus,”
Boozer said. “We give our own views.”

The majority of ideas that come up in
the magazine are brainstormed by co-
chairs. Durham and Kamari Somers, who
reach out to the community to ﬁnd writers.
The Steering Committee, a board of the
organization’s members, suggest ideas for
the magazine as well.

The release party is the society’s biggest
way of creating awareness. Students write
about a multitude of topics such as arts,
poetry, music, issues in other organizations
and their own experiences. The publication
aims to highlight the group’s goal of pro-

artist, The Infamous E, and even an act of

Actor, activist facilitates

Hill Harper remembered his third day at
Harvard. Wanting to blow off steam, he
headed to the gym to shoot hoops. Nobody
was there. Although the library was ﬁill, the
gym was empty. When Harper was about to
leave, in walked a tall, skinny man wearing
short shorts.

I Harper asked him to play, and a game be-

gan between the two.
His opponent’s.name was Barack Obama,

and -it turned out they were in the same class .

at  Law School. Together, they joined
the recreational basketball team and became
friends. I . .

An audience of about 40 came to hear

Harper speak about planning one’s own life to

mark the closing of the Black Action Society’s
annual Indaba week, a series of lectures and
ceremonies that touch on topics of impor-
tance. Harper, aHarvard Law School graduate,
actor and author, spoke in the O’Hara Student
Center dining room and ballroom from 7:30
to 9 p.m. , - V
Harperbegan the lecture in Socratic fash-
ion. Rather than just speaking, he began by
having the audience members write down
their goals and dreams. I
According to Harper, building a life is a
conscious process. Though describing one’s
dream and desires can be easy, the pathvand
steps leading to the end result are often not as
clear. Harper used an extended analogy that
compared going through life to the process of

' designing and constructing a building.

He told everyone in the audience to create
ablueprint. According to Harper, every mem-

ber ofthe audience shouldwrite the blueprint .

down to keep from modifying the goal ifthings
aren’t going as platmed.

Next, he discussed how every life must
have afoundation. Money and education can
both be part of the foundation, but neither
guarantees health or happiness.

“If you build your foundation adequately,
you will be able to create the structure you
want,” Harper said.

Harper said Obama’s entry into Harvard
Law School better solidiﬁed the ﬁiture presi-

den_t’s_foundation.- Despite an undergradu-

ate degree from Columbia University, Obama
needed more education to realize his dreams.

. Harper said that everyone should build
a framework, which is comprised of one’s
personal decisions. _ .

_ Lastly, individuals must build doors. They
are important because they serve as an entry
point for new people, new ideas and new in-
formation. But they also serve to let “toxic
associates” out. ’

William Augustus Griffin, a senior major-
ingininformation sciences, said that Harper’s
lecture was “fantastic in the sense that it was
very interactive with the call and response
method. He was humorous and engaging.”

Griffin said he plans to pursue his goals of
becoming avideo game designer and founder
of a startup company.

Chandel Boozer, president of the Black
Action Society, said she and the other offi-
cers of the society have been planning Indaba
since the summer. This year’s theme was to
“enlighten, enrich and enhance the under-
graduate community.”

Boozer said that the lecture deﬁnitely em-
powered the organization.

“When we take his words and make a plan,
set afoundation, make smart choices and not
allow fear to cripple us from growth, we’ll be
successful this year,” Boozer said. I

MDMA culture conceals drug’s dangers

Sophia Al Rasheed
Columnist

When Diplo, who rose to fame as
rapper M.I.A.’s disc jockey, has an
issue with the drug usage associ-
ated with rave culture, it must be
a matter in question.

“If you’re going to go to a festi-
val, drink water for six days before
you get there. Don’t drink no alco-
hol. If you’re going to do a pill and
a half, don’t do four more and then
pass out, overheat and die of car-
diac arrest.,Instead of acting like
drugs don’t exist, acknowledge
that drugs will be at a festival and
address them.”

While grammar and structure
leave much to be desired, per-
haps there is some substance to
Diplo’s proposal addressing the
MDMA — the_ crystal form of
Ecstasy commonly referred to as

“Molly” — issue that is evident
today. The article reveals eye-
opening facts such as the pres-
ence of testing booths at music
festivals in Europe, which allow
consumers to make sure that the
drugs they are about to use are
not laced with anything, which is
one of the biggest concerns with

the white powder substance that

has this generation talking.

But Diplo has failed to consider
that, in the United States, we can’t
even regulate our com properly, so
enthusiasts of this proposal will
likely wait a long time for these
practices to move into the Ameri-
can recreational drug arena. Until
then, the public can expect users
to continue to ignore the fatalities
and warning signs from medical
sources and news articles because
here’s the thing about most drug
users: If they’re in a position to

use recreational drugs to begin
with, they likely do not care at all.
And this is the scary thing
about the increased number of
Molly users today and the real is-
sue at hand foryoung individuals:
The increase in use of such a hard
drug and its casual presence re-
veals a new presence ofindividuals

, who have lost their reason to care.

News outlets such as TIME
Magazine and CNN have published
articles in the past, all of which
shed light on the fact that “Molly”
is a cute name for a very danger-
ous drug. But they have been too
scientiﬁc and one—dimensional in
their descriptions of the negative
side effects of the drug, merely
pointing to the adverse health is-
sues and, recently, its potential
to cause death. Drugs have been

around for a long time, and consumers
know what they are getting themselves into
when they become involved with them, so
it seems futile to hope for any change this
late in the game.

While drug users have only themselves
to blame for their use of stimulants, we’re
not paying enough attention to why they
increasingly succumb to this pressure.
Molly has made its way into a wide de-
mographic, attracting both the good kids
who follow rules maintain high GPAs
and the typical rave attendees, creating

September 16, 2018 l The Pitt News l \/\AANv.pittnevvs.eem

a pseudo—culture of seemingly uniﬁed,
euphoric individuals, many of whom you
would never have expected to turn to [drugs
in the ﬁrst place.

But,. sadly, Molly culture is no more
than a fake idea of a collective and a fake
perception of happiness. For many, it acts
as a temporary ﬁx to a very deep—rooted

issue, namely that this feeling of ‘happiness

is worth risking your life. 

As with any drug, media and celebrity
gloriﬁcation" has made it difﬁcult for the
youth to clearly see reasons to avoid the
drug. But I foundvit interesting that one

of the summer’s chart toppers was widely V
misunderstood as gloriﬁcation when, in
actuality, it aimed to expose the dark af—_:

termath of Molly usage. There have been
multiple posts about the analysis of Miley
Cyrus’s music video for “We Can’t Stop,”
which is actually a ballad about loneliness
—. a message that blatantly describes be-
ing engulfed in something that we really
can’t control anymore. A recent Business
Insider post highlights key elements of
the video in its analysis — an interesting
read for the artistic aspect. The highlight
of the music video, when the shot cuts to
a taxidermy deer standing in front of a
36o—degree mirror, representing what the
Molly culture do es to individuals. The deer,
while apparently alive, is actually hollowed
out and preserved in an image of what a
live deer would looklike, appearing to be

surrounded by others like it but, in reality,
standing alone and lifeless.

In a twistedly fortunate way, the fact that
drugs, including Molly, have been around
for a long time gives reason to believe that
their recreational use could simply be a
phase for this generation. for many, Molly
will simply be something that parents will
hide from their kids and_ refer to it as what
they did when they were young and didn’t
care. But, if we’re continuing to rely on ar-
tiﬁcial forms df happiness, if we’re hoping
to make up for something by ingesting a
white powder, we have a much bigger issue
at hand. This, rather than the safety precau-
tions of a fake solution, is what should be
on our minds. I

freakish athleticism, crediting the
wide receiver for his uncommonly
poised demeanor as a true freshman.

“He just gets it,” Savage said. “There
are some kids like that, and he’s one
of them. You get into a game, and he
just knows how to come down with the
ball. He does it nonstop at practice, so
I wasn’t surprised at all when he made
that play.”

In that case, Boyd’s day was chock-
full of boring plays. In full stride, he
hauled in a 51-yard pass from Savage
—— while drawing a flag for defensive
pass interference, no less —‘— to set up
Pitt’s first score of the day.

About eight minutes later, Boyd
scored in style, diving toward the end
zone pylon after reversing around the
line of scrimmage, taking the handoff
and scurrying through the Lobos’ de-
fense for 33 yards.

Then, of course, came the half-
ending, leaping grab, which was made
possible when Boyd saw his quarter-
back scrambling and decided to break
downfield.

His day ended with 195 all—purpose
yards — 134 receiving, 39 rushing and
22 returning a kick —- and two touch-
‘downs.

Head coach Paul Chryst was in the
same lightly populated crowd as Savage.

“I’ve learned not to be surprised by
Tyler,” Chryst said. “I think he can still
be better. I certainly appreciate the way
he approaches the game and competes
and plays. He’s fun to be around.”

Boyd, who scored his first collegiate
touchdown and became the first true

freshman to record a 100—yard receiv— '

ing game for Pitt since Oct. 18, 2008,
said, “I just wanted to spark [the of-
fense] for my team. I wanted my team
to have my back and know that I had
theirs.”

Humbled,

Ryan Bertonaschi
Suﬁ Writer

Just two games into his renewed career at
Pitt, redshirt junior linebacker Todd Thomas
co—led thePanthers football team with nine
tackles, highlighted by a monstrous throw-
down for a 7-yard loss on New Mexico’s fake-
punt attempt.

The play happened in the fourth quar-
ter Saturday, with Pitt up 42-20. Thomas,
who was stationed on the line of scrimmage,
recognized New Mexico reserve running
back Jhurell. Pressley motioning across the
backﬁeld to receive a reverse handoff, so he
pounced on him.

“On the sideline we just yelled, ‘Watch
the fake!’” senior defensive tackle Aaron
Donald said. “Todd just happened to blow
it up. He was just being a playmaker. That’s
what it’s about.”

Head coach Paul Chryst was equally

pleased to see Thomas thwart the Lobos.

“It still takes him putting himself in that
situation, but that was nice to see him make
that play,” Chryst said.

Thomas said Chryst and his staff had fore-
warned the players of such trickery during
practices this past week, creditingthe prepa-
ration for his storming tackle.

“We went through it all week,” Thomas
said. “It was my key, and that was my read.
I just did whatl had to do, and I did my job.”

Hailing from Beaver Falls, Pa., and Mil-
ford Academy in New York, Thomas has led
an injury-plagued career mixed with stints of
exceptional play. He sustained a torn anterior
cruciate ligament as a freshman in 2010,
resulting in season—ending surgery and a
redshirt. In 2011, he played in 10 games, but
reaggravated his knee, causing him to miss
the season’s ﬁnal three games and go back
under the knife. Thomas’ second surgery also

caused him to miss the ﬁrst four games of
2012, but he still ﬁnished the season as Pitt’s
third—leading tackler among non-seniors.

On the ﬁrst day of training camp in2013,
Thomas was playing with the second team
core of linebackers behind redshirt junior
Anthony Gonzalez and redshirt sophomore
Mike Caprara. He decided to leave the team
that evening, a mistake he now looks back
on in the ﬁrst time speaking with the media
since last season.

“I realized _I didn’t want to make that
decision,” Thomas said. “I love Pitt. I was
here from day one. I realized I didn’t want
to change anything. In order for me to come
back, I had to change the way I carried my-
self, and I did that for the team.

“Deﬁnitely, it was lesson learned right
there. I’m just thankful that Coach let me

Panthers falter late in loss
to Boston College

Andrew Stern
Sniff Wrz'ter

Pitt men’s soccer played with a lead through
80 minutes Saturday, but a pair of late defen-
sive lapses cost the team dearly. In the 81st
and 89th minutes, Pitt allowed Boston Col-
lege to score twice in just a nine-minute span
— the deciding goals of a 2-1 Panther loss.

“This was very disappointing tonight
because we played our best game thus far,”
Panther head coachjoe Luxbacher said after
the game. “We’re playing top teams every
week, and we really need to know how to
close out the game. This is a very difﬁcult
loss because we get nothing out of it in terms
of poin .” ' ' .

Early on, Pift (O-2-2, 0-2 ACC)_was the

A aggressor, as the team jumped on Boston

College (2-2-1, 1-1 ACC) with a goal by fresh-
man defender Zane Meehan in the 13th
minute.

To score the goal, Meehan took a perfect
free kick from Ryan Myers and ﬂicked, the
ball off the inside of his foot and into the net.
The goalwas the ﬁrst of Meehan’s career, arid
the ﬁrst time Pitt has_ scored in an ACC game.

“There was a fantastic ball sent in by
Myers, and I just streaked in front of the
defender and got a piece of it and sent it
into the net,” Meehan said.

Following the goal, the two teams played
extremely even soccer through the halftime
whistle. The most dangerous chance for
Boston College came in the 22nd minute,
when the ball deﬂected off the shin ‘guard
of freshman Stephane Pierre and bounded
toward the net. But sophomore goalkeeper
Dan Lynd saw the ball heading toward the
back of the net and punched the ball out of
harm’s way, allowing the Panthers to clear
the ball back to center.

Following the halftime break, the Pan-
thers had ample opportunities to score their
second goal of the match and take a com-
manding 2-0 lead.

In the 66th minute, Myers, a redshirt
sophomore, sent a free kick in the direc-
tion of Cory Werth, who was able to send a
header toward the net. Boston College goalie
Keady Segel punched the ball out of play for
his lone save of the match. ’

Senior forward Chris Davis, who reg-

istered ﬁve shots, credited Myers for his
effective free kicks. '

“Set plays are extremely important to us,
and we’ve been working on them in train-
ing,” Davis said. “Ryan has assisted on a
couple already, so we’re deﬁnitely looking
good in that area.”

Following the attempt, the Panthers went
into a shell on defense in an attempt to keep
the Eagles off the scoreboard and preserve
their 1-0 lead. ' ‘ ’

It worked for at least some time, as the
Panthers staved off a pair of Boston College
scoring opportunities. Credit the defensive
effort largely to Lynd, who made the two
best saves of the match in the 77th and 78th
minutes. _

But while Lynd saved the Panthers seven
times on the stat sheet, he was unable to
save them just two minutes later when BC
scored the equalizer.

Giuliano Frano sent a ball that found a
streaking Atobra Ampadu who corralled the
ball and sent a header that eluded a sprawl-
ing Dan Lynd and tumbled into the far right
corner of the net. I

Following the BC goal, however, Pitt had
three separate chances to take the lead.

On the last of the three chances, though,
Pitt’s defense got caught. The momentary
lapse allowed Diego Medina-Mendez to con-
nect with Frano, who, after securing the ball,
ﬁred a shot through a diving Dan Lynd and
into the right hand side of the net with just
65 seconds to play.

“We had our chances, but these missed.

chances determine the outcome of the
game,” Luxbacher said. “We had a few, but
they made one more than us. We played our
most complete game thus far, but you can-
not lose focus —— even for just a momen .”

The loss was the second consecutive
heartbreaker for the Panthers, and the
16th consecutive loss in conference games,
a streak that dates back to days in the Big
East conference. The Panthers’ next chance
to pick up their ﬁrstconference win will be
Sept. 21 against No. 15 Wake Forest Uni-
versity. ~.
Meehan realizes the tough test posed in
their next match.

back, and it feels great,” he humbly added.

When asked about the process of rejoin-
ing the team, Thomas said it was all up to
his teammates.

“ [They asked me], ‘Are you ready for
change?’ And I said yeah. The way I carried
myself wasn’t really appropriate, so I just
came back, did what I [had] to do, showed
them that I could change, and now I’m back
andthankful for that, for the seniors, from
the freshmen on up, Coach Chryst and the
staff, for letting me come bac .”

Thomas also said he’s a changed man.

“I’m calm. I’m just relaxed. I ain’t hyper
no more,” Thomas said, spurring laughter.
“[I had to] stay humble, and that’s what I
did. I changed for the team. I’m thankful that
everybody let me do that. I really love the
team, and I enjoy playing for this team. But
it’s over with now. We’re back. We got a win
today, and I’m happy.”

All week Panthers defenders prepared for
New Mexico’s run-based option offense and
running back Kasey Carrier, who, coming
into Saturday, lead all Division I—A players
in rushing yards with 345 and averaged 172.5
yards per game. He was also ranked 14th in
the nation in scoring.

Yet, against Pitt, Thomas and his defense
denied Carrier of similar statistics: He racked
up just 22 yards on seven carries._

“Everybody did their assignments,” said
Thomas, who was responsible for wrapping
up Carrier 2 1/2 times.

“Todd Thomas, he’s aplaymaker,” Donald
said. “He had his ups and downs before the
season. We’re happy to have Todd, and he’s
a great player. He’s going to make a lot more
plays.”

teammates followed suit by bursting
big plays and having each other’s backs?

Just look at Boyd’s class.

Look at fellow true freshman James
Conner and his 119 rushing yards and
two scores, or freshman tight end Scott
Orndoff whose first career touchdown
opened the Panthers’ offensively po-
tent afternoon or Chris Blewitt, a rookie
kicker who nailed all seven of his extra
points.

In fact, Pitt’s first 35 points were
posted by true freshmen, a stretch that
led Conner to say, “The future’s bright.”

Conner is a big part of that future
and the inspiration for Savage to tell
reporters after the game that they’re
“in for a treat for the next four years.”

Junior running back Isaac Bennett
also provided entertaining offense, bull-
dozing defenders and often shoving his
way into the end zone. Bennett picked
up two touchdowns and 101 yards on 14
carries, his first career outing, which

        

evidently eclipsed the century mark in 1

yardage.

Though Savage deflected the spot-
light to his younger teammates and
role players such as Bennett and the
members of the offensive line, his ﬁnal
stats certainly merit attention, too. The
Panther gunslinger tossed two touch-
downs and completed 13-of-17 attempts
for 236 yards. His day started roughly
when he threw an interception on the
team’s first play from scrimmage, but

brightened once his teammates picked
him up — on and off the field.

“Our whole team [encouraged me],”
Savage said. “And that’s what’s really

game,’ but the whole team came up and
just rallied me.”

He credited Boyd and redshirt senior
receiver Devin Street for making his job
easier. But even in a game when Street
surpassed former Panther great Larry
Fitzgerald for third on the school’s all-
time receptions list, the afternoon be-
longed to Boyd, still just a teenager who
spent his high school career at Clairton
starring in at least four positions.

To that effect, Savage is at least
slightly surprised with one aspect of

   

ll’ information needs, and the technoig; 
  manage suchinformation.   

Boyd’s game: his advanced approach
at receiver after not having manned

‘ the position full—time as a prep player.

“After the first game, I thought he
did better than what I expected he
was going to do,” Savage said. “After
this game, it’s clear he’s just a football
player, and he knows how to play the
game. He’s the type of kid who you just
need to put the ball in their hands and
let them work and sit back and have
fun watching?’ m

“We played really well all game, but we had
two mental lapses in the back that caused
the two goals,” Meehan said. “All it takes is
two mistakes sometimes, and you lose. We’re
not going to face a team worse than [Boston
College] in the ACC all year because everyone
in this conference is extremely good. So we’re

going to have to show up even harder than
we did today.” m
