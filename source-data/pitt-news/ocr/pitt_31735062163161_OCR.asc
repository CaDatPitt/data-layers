Survey Results Positive

The Student Government
Committee on Internal Rela-
tions,- organized last trimester
in an attempt to improve stu-
dent~faculty relations, is be-
ginning to show positive re-
sults. ,

In answer to questionnaires sent
out two weeks ago to faculty mem-
bers, Carl Pepine, chairman of the
committee, reported that there-
sponse was “surprisingly good.”

Because the questionnaires were
sent out such a short time ago,
only about 25 per cent have been
returned, but Pepine stated that
the majority of the faculty does
seem to feel that there is a need
to .improve student-faculty rela-
tions.--Some faculty members show
a willingness toserve as much as’

   

' detrimental in this respect.

He said that only about one
or two of the faculty that an-
swered the questionnaire felt
that thcrewas no need to im-
prove the student faculty rela-
tions.

Pepine said that "it was the
newer members of the faculty,
those who had served ten years or
less, who felt the greatest need for
improving the relationships.

Those members of the faculty
who stated a" willingness to help
student groups ranged their inter-
ests from discussion groups to
hiking an ‘ outing clubs.

Another of the questions asked
on the questionnaire concerned
the effects of the trimester plan
on student-faculty relationships.
Pepine said that most members of
the faculty answered that the pro-
gram took valuable time from both
students and teachers, and it__was

AISERMAN

Middayiseries will be Eugene; .

J emison, artist, folksinger, and printmaker, who will enter-*

tain by the singing of ballads and folksongs,'accompanied by . ;

his own guitar.

As a mural painter and printmaker, Jemison has held
of his work and has contrib-My

numerous one-man exhibitions

uted to galleries all over the:
country. He has even developed
new painting materials by using
such contemporary materials as
plastic and cinylite. -

Artistically, Jemison has dis-
tinguished himself as a painter
and printmaker of folk themes.
Inspired by folklore, folk songs,
and folk poetry, he has attempted
to synthesize this cultural expres-
sion and to translate it into vis-
ual formsf »

‘Educational Purpose

“The purpose of education,” he
states, ‘fshould be the develop-
ment of the whole human being.‘
The arts in their varied forms are
some means for heightening,
deepening and reﬁning the senses
of sight and hearing, and through
them our whole inner wealth of
feeling, expeprience, and mem-
ories.”- ‘

Mr.’ Jemison suggests that
, there be a collaboration-of spe-
cialists, such as the artist and
the musician. He feels that, in
this age of specialization it
-would be better to integrate the
" ‘various aspects of the arts, to
ﬁnd out how ‘one supplements
the other.

“Materials basic to our society,”
he concludes, “such as folklore,
folk song, painting and
printmaking, help furnish the in-
tegrating power which’ permits
one to think and to act in terms
of a human" agent through the
arts.”

‘Meal Ticlret Freedom

Meal tickets for resident students should not be com-
pulsory.

With the increase in the number of students living on
campus in the Fall, long lines and crowded conditions will
exist in the cafeteria. Although the third counter that is be-
ing added may alleviate somewhat the long lines, the in-
adequate seating capacity still remains a problem.

Many students would ﬁnd it more economical not to
buy a meal ticket. This is especially true of women students,
since those living in Brackenridge House have complete
kitchen facilities in their suites.

Resident students who spend many weekends at home
must, under the present arrangement, pay for meals they

. never eat. The same is true of students who prefer to skip

breakfast, or who attend noon hour meetings and programs.

There are a number of inexpensive, conveniently lo-
cated restaurants in the Oakland area where students who
do not wishto buy meal tickets may eat.

Perhaps the University feels that it has an obligation

to see to it that students get properly-balanced, wholesome

meals. This is presuming, then, that college students are
not mature enough to plan a proper diet for themselves.
Even if this were so, the fact remains that students who
do eat in the cafeteria can ‘select a meal for themselves
which is quite unbalanced, although a proper diet has been
planned by the Food Service staff.

Accordingto a recent article in “College and University

Business,” the trend in schools throughout. the cour_itry'i§
away from the flat rate for a meal ticket. The article points
out that it is’ more economical and democratic from a stu-
dent?s point of view, but that this practice poses problems

' for the food service management.

Such a plan at the University would bring Food Serv-
ice into competition with other resturants in the Oakland

"area, and proyide a challenge for improvedfood and serv-

ice and better merchandising. If Food Service meets this
challenge they should have no difficulty attracting custom-
ers from the student body.‘

Little rationale exists, then, for the compulsory meal
ticket. The University should recognize this and make the
necessary change in pglicy, hopefully, before the fall term.

Welcome, Summer Students-

We welcome Summer Session students to the" Univer-
sity. Today marks the beginning of the main Summer Ses-
sion which will continue_ for six weeks.

For the ﬁrst time, summer school will be conducted .

simultaneously with the third trimester, which 5000 full
and part time students are attending. Summer Session stu-
dents, for this reason, should ﬁnd the University vastly
different from other years.

More Midday Series of a ‘high calibre are scheduled.
Student Union events, such as dances, ‘teas, and discussions

are also planned. The Library, cafeteria, and Tuck Shop A

will be open for longer hours than in previous summers.

Summer Sessions students are welcomed to participate

‘in the events and to make use of the facilities on the chang-

ing summer campus.

Vacation on the Black Sea?

Mikoyan on the Wane

‘ By Rodger D. Yeager

Western observers have recently noticed that
First Deputy Premier to the U.S.S.R., Anastas
Mikoyan, perennial party_and bureaucracy power
ﬁgure, has perhaps fallen from favor within the
Kremlin. It is indeed surprising that Comrade
Mikoyan has managed to retain high echelon grace
for as long as he has. - -

As early as the last days of Stalin’s life, Mikoyan
launched a violent attack on the Stalinist regime
and even upon Stalin himself. But after Sta1in’s
death, when party members aspiring for higher of-
ﬁ,ce« eulogized him, Mikoyan chose to carry .on his
attack with even greater force than before.

At the Twentieth Party Congress of Feb. 16,

1956, Mikoyan stated that he found “hardly help-‘

ful, hardly correct, a wellknown dictum of Stalin

in “Economic Problems of Socialism in the U. S.
S. R.” This example illustrates‘ the penetrating
and acid nature of the First Deputy’s words.

Highly lmpertinent Actions _

In a matter of months, his onslaught reached
such proportions that a full scale party debate
developedbetween him and the Stalin supporters,
headed by Khrushchev.

\ .

One might wonder how Mikoyan could get
away _with his highly 'irrfpertinent actions. The
answer lies in his popularity with the party bur-
eaucracy, the then most powerful single body
within the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.
And, surprisingly, this popularity was not only
enough to sustain the strength of his argument, but
enough to win it. Khrushchev now changed his
line of comments so that after the ‘debate they
almost coincided with his rival’s words.

As ‘Khrushchev ﬁnally assumed leadership _in
the Soviet Union, he was forced, again by Miko-
yan’s popularity with the bureaucracy, to retain
him as First Deputy Premier. ‘ ‘

But recently, because of two events, Mikoyan’s,

continued survival has become a matter of conjec-

, Balcler - clashes

Treatise on aTorioise

Jim’ Vaughan" ,
Huge forest ﬁres and ghastly automobile acci-

dents, I understand, are -usually caused by acts of

carelessness. But I never knew, until this morning,
that you can get yourself into scores of even worse‘
difficulties by deliberately saving
something from destruction.

As seven—thirty this morning,
I has just ﬁnished working all
night in Clapp Hall. I made my
way, tired and sleepy, out of the
Fifth Ave. door closest to WQED.
Squinting from the brightness of
the rising sun, I saw, at ﬁrst,
only numbers of cars swishing
along the street. .

But, as I reached the side-, 
walk, I saw a dark object mov-
ing slowly across the car-tracks toward the Cathe-
dral lawn. - ,

From my right came a car that passed over it;

another swerved to the side and missed it; and a.

third almost hit it. Through, the cars passing on
my side of the street .I saw that it was a turtle. I
.could see it would, never get across. 0

At the ﬁrst break in the traﬁic, I dashed out,
picked it up, and ran to the Cathedral sidewalk.
There, I set him down in an openingiin the hedges.

With green and pale yellow seashell markings, he"

looked like a camﬂouged battered old German
helmet discarded by its wearer.

All's: Clear

I knelt‘ on the sidewalk and waited for the
turtle’s head and paws to re-appear. When they
ﬁnally did he‘ raised himself and started through
the hedge. Happily, I watched him walk onto
greener pastures.

What do you suppose that damned animal did
when he got on one of the best lawns in town?
He took a few steps, stopped, and’ turned his nose
toward the Cathedral. While he raised his nose as
if to survey its height, a pride swelled within me.
But not for long. For the turtle turned around and
came right back through the hedges. I tell you,
I was humiliated! The very thought of our uni-
versity being spurned by a mere turtle! Think of it.

What could I do, I ask you? I couldn’t force
him to accept Pitt if he didn’t want to. After all,
turtles have rights too. Besides, I didn’t want to

‘be a party to the encouragement of turtlewalking
‘on the University lawn; I think _there’s a rule

stereotyped lad with his turtle. 

‘ my righthand an angry, snapping, -hissing, enuretic

ture. May Day festivities in Moscow failed to pro-
duce Anastas Mikoyan as one of the ﬁrst ﬁve
Soviet officials, for the ﬁrst time since 1957. And
on May 3, “Party Life,” the party Central Com-
mittee periodical, failed to even mention him in an
article on the party in Azerbaijan, even. though
he was the main organizer of the communization
of this province.

Glaring Absence

Has Mikoyan lost favor with his bureaucracy?‘
Has the arch rival of the bureaucracy, the army, }~IL;’q
ﬁnally gained enough power to inﬂuence his politi- ”§_
cal eclipse? Or is it as the Soviets say? Is
Mikoyan really resting at the Pitsunda resort on 
the Black Sea? , ...f.

Although the issue itself is still an open one, 
an analysis of these possible explanations of
Mikoyan’s absence is now possible First, has
Mikoyan really lost favor: with the bureaucracy?

V.

 

 

quickly. As far as the West knows, his relations
with the bureaucracy are still compatible. In
Mikoyan, the bureaucracy has a powerful friend
who is capable of answering their private demands.
And in the bureaucracy, Mikoyan has an equally
powerful base of support for the maintenance of
his own power position. V I ,

Concerning the Soviets’ explanation of Miko-
yan’s absence, an oﬂicial of his position would cer-
tainly have to be at death’s door to miss an_ event
as important as May Day. And the absence of his
name from the article in “Party Life” has no"

 

Indicative of Political Death

By elimination there is left only one real an-
svger. It is this writer’s opinion. that the conserva- ,v
tive ‘army' element in the Soviet Union has been A
gaining political power since the closing days of
World .War II, and that it is now powerful enough‘, _
to influence‘ personnel and perhaps even policy

 

If Mikoyan’s absence ‘actually indicates his ' 1
political death, is this demise an omen ofa switch
in Soviet policy which mush certainly move away
from Khrushchev’s liberalism?

 

I. didn’t know -what to do with this turtle. Since. '

I had saved his hide, I somehow regarded him as 
my charge. I couldn’t let him go back into the, "
street as he wanted. He would have gotten killed.
And to set him free onthe other side of the street
would ‘ have meant only getting him killed -on?
another street. So, I ‘stood there with a disaillu-"
sioned Box Turtle on my hands. ~
Homeward Bound .

With dulled mental’ faculties and an unconsciouge.‘
endearment to turtles I picked him up with the
idea of placing him, on my way home, in aiplace -
where he would surely be happy and healthy. The
responsibility for his life now weighed on me
heavy and certain. ‘ ,

Gripping him ﬁrmly, I started "walking home.
When I got to the Shadyside shopping district,
gawking, pointing people made me feel like the

It seemed.that everyone I passed looked at me‘ 
with a smug grin, a grin of one who catches an .
old man drinking milk secretly from a babyibottle. 7

I had just about made it home when an old,’ ,
lady with white hair, thick frameless glasses, if f
bowed legs, and a cane came hobbling along. 
A Painful Encounter V _ .1.-

Smilingi dotingly, she stopped and raised her ‘ '1
cane. “Hello sonny,” she said, “that certainly, is a_ 
nice looking turtle you have there.” She choked '
up on her cane and hit the turtle a couple of ' .
friendly raps on his shell saying, “you haven’t". .
been misbehaving today, have you little fellow?” 7}

Answering for «the turtle I said “no maam,” to 
the cain-raising lady. And I politely hurried on.

When I got home I saw the little kid across
the street playing in his yard. After much fa‘st
talking I conned the little guy into accepting my
real_ life turtle. But I had no sooner entered the
house when the kid’s mother was at my door,
turtle in hand. I took it back apologetically.

 Campus Cops Concentrate
I I On Cornering Car-Crackers

By TOM MCGOVERN
Most students’ ﬁrst contact with the campus policecomes
. when they return to their illegally parked cars to ﬁnd a
ticket tucked under ‘the windshield wiper. _
A ' The enforcement‘ of parking regulations is only one part
of functions of the ofﬁcers of the campus police force. All of-
ﬁcers are appointed by act of Common Pleas Court of Alle-

gheny County, and have full pow-
ed to make arrests for all viola-
tions of the law. .

They patrol all parts of the cam-
pus by automobile, jeep, and mo-
torcycle, and maintain a round
the clock watch to keep order and
protect property from thieves and
vandals. The jeep patrol alone has
put more than 20,000 miles on the
speedometer in the last year, in
the course of covering its beat.

. Campus Patrol
;_ . Despite the. long hours‘ that they
 spend patrolling, they cannot be
everywhere at once, and students
at who park their cars in the vicinity
of the university, particularlyon
the "upper campus, are cautioned
not to leave objects of any value
locked inside, except in the trunk
compartment.

The campus police have re-
ceived n u In e r 0 us complaints
from people who have returned
to their cars to ﬁnd that win-
dows have been broken in or-
der to steal clothes, cigarettes,
andvarious small items which
had been left inside. \0ne car

 of stealing a box of Kleenex

 . which the driver had left on the
‘seat. .

Also being investigated are a
number of recent thefts from
Scaife Hall which have occurred
within the last two months. Most
of these have been cases of money
being stolen from wallets or purs_es
carelessly left lying around, but a
few have been major thefts.

Several, valuable . microscopes

‘ have been reported missing. One
" of these, valued at 900 dollars, dis-

appeared recently from Alan Ma-

i.,—: Founder of Far Eastern Program Leaves
 Liu to Assume Professorship

At Stanford University in July

~ , By HARRY LEWINTER

Dr. James T. C. Liu,-founder of the Far Eastern Program,
will be leaving the University in July to take up his profes-
sorship with the history departinent of Stanford University,
Palo Alto, California. He will still serve as a special con-
sultant to the Far Eastern Program of the University.

Born in Shanghai, China, Dr. Liu himself .a “mixed cul-

_ tural product” having been a stu- 9
"dent of confucian classics under

private tutors, of a Catholic high
school, of a government college,
and then of a Protestant college.

"Presently Dr. Liu has the dual
role of professor‘ of history and
director of the Far Eastern .Pro-
grain’ in the School of Liberal
Arts. He received his Ph. D. from
'the University in 1950, taught at

Yale University for a year, and-

then joined the staff in 1951.
Library Grows

His wife, Dr. "H. C. Wang Liu,
is the pioneer of the Chinese lan-
guage instruction at the Univer-
sity. The collection_ of Oriental
works in the library also has in-
creased since the Lius ﬁrst arriv-
ed here. '

His reason for leaving the
University after more than nine
years of intensive work is bas-
'ed.upon his desire to make use
of the extensive Oriental col-
lection of the Hoover Institute
at Stanford.

In‘ his crowded, but tidy, 29th
ﬂoor office, Dr. Liu recalled the
1 humorous ‘side of his experience
as a teacher. For example, in one
of his classes a student once ask-
ed him, “Does China have "pris-
ons?” His answer was, “China
has eggs, also!”

Old Problem Arises

When discussing the tax eva-
-sion problem in Chinese history
in‘ one of his classes, he said “it
is also true" to a certain extent
now in the USA, ‘now taxation
without mis-representation.”’

This is the way he teaches;
his _lectures spiced with the
easy wit and humor, and with'
anecdotes drawn from his many
years of experience as a schol-
ar, journalist, and lecturer.

Currently doing research on
Japapnese policies toward China
as a‘ cause of World War II, Dr.
Liu intends to have his manu-
script completed by next spring.
He also wrote “Reform in Sung
China,” published by Harvard
last year and was co—author of
“Chinese Thought and Institu-

This year Dr. Liu was named
the recipient of a grant from the
