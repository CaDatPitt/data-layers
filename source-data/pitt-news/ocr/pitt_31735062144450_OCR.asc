“They’re Either Too Young.  ”

University, Navy Discover  

Kenneth E. Lemley has both the Navy and the University of
Pittsburgh tearing their hair. For a lad of eighteen years he’s just
too smart.

First of all, schools of dentistry don’t grant degrees to men under
twenty-one. Active practice is not open to minors. But young Lem-
ley, having completed his pref-dental course at the University of West
Virginia and the accelerated ‘thirty-two month dentistry course at
Pitt was technically entitled to¢
his doctorate. Considering that he]
stood second in his class, the Pitt
faculty hurriedly deci-ded to waive
.the rule. So on January 26, he
became Dr. Lemley.

‘Only the beginning; as a naval

trainee in the V-12 unit at Pitt,
Dentist Lemley was eligible for a
junior grade lieutenancy. Again,
this title is awarded only to those
of voting age. Now it was the
Navy’s turn to worry. The con-
troversy spread until Washington
heard the story. Here, the gold
braid really became perturbed—
ﬁguring if it’s Lieutenant Lemley
at eighteen, ‘why not Admiral Lem-
ley at twenty-one? As a com-
promise they agreed to permit
him to practice dentistry in the
Navy as an ensign.

Dear Sirs: ‘ _ _

, Recently, Student Congress has been criticized by many of
the student body for its action regarding University dancesfor
the remainder of the calendar year. We of the student govern-
ment feel that our critics have not been well acquainted with
the facts of the situation and that under the circumstances, their
observations are unjust.

The ﬁrst point we would like to make clear is that SC has
not, as many people suppose, cancelled dances wholesale. Ex-
actly one dance, scheduled for April 7th, has been dropped from
the-social program. There was no Junior prom slated for the
Spring term. Spring Festival, will, to the best of our knowl-
. . . . . . ,
edge, continue according to tradition and to this year s calen-

4

.Many of the accusations on the dance question have been

erroneously aimed at SC because of the decision of WSGA to I

drop the Heart Hop from its calendar. Heart Hop, as many
tudents know and an equal number do not, IS a women’s dance,
ponsored and planned by the Senior women at the University.
Another dance, over which Congress has no control, _is Panhel—
enic Ball, also a women’s dance, planned by fraternity council
or fraternity women. As far as we know, it will go ahead as
scheduled. I . . _

. K In cancelling the only remaining dance on the University
‘calendar, we considered the matter from every angle, loglsal,
ﬁnancial, and sentimental, And we feel that we have arrived

t the only possible solution. The three dances to date have

een anything but ﬁnancial successes. In addition they have been

ery poorly attended; in fact, in one case that we know of, there
ere actually two affairs planned, intentionally or not, to com-
ete with the SC—sponsored aﬁair. This state of affairs proves
nly one thing in our minds: either there are not ‘a sufﬁcient
;«-number of students at Pitt to support a dance or Pitt students
re not interested in school. dances. Whatever the cause, it is

ot one conducive to planning extensive social programs.
Sincerely, ,
- Student Congress.

  sham: Bacfy 3fiec/«t

! The student body realizes, just as fully as their government
s'epresentatives,, that “something must be done” about our
, But their solution to the problem would be very
different, I think, from that of Student Congress. The Pitt joes
and janes are criticizing‘ not the fact that SC took action, for
I eaven knows it was needed, but they are criticizing the direc-
tion that action took. ' ~
A Their plea is “give us another chance.” Admitted that -the
three University dances to date have not been successful ﬁnan-
cially, nevertheless they were well planned and enjoyed byall
ho attended. Admitted that the dance ﬂoor was not mobbed
at any of the aﬁairs, still the crowd was just the right size, large
enough to create a happy atmosphere and small enough to permit
those who attended to dance. Admitted also that very probably
the students who are complaining are those who supported all
three dances and that any future dance would attract these very
same people, however these students number a sufficiently large
and representative group to warrant some consideration of their
needs.
A A dance, to be successful, does not necessarily have to _be
laborate: I remember some of the most successful University
dances we ever had, football victory swings for instance, were
given in the women’s gym of the Cathedral with records or a
cry small local band supplying the music. Today, many
hools, one I could mention not a “ﬂowershow’s-distance” from
,.itt, are scheduling record dances in high school gyms. And
the women at some of these schools have_ no temerity, it seems
about asking a boy she knows to a “heart-hop” type of dance. .
If Pitt can ’t support an expensive dance, then the answer 1S
not to drop dances entirely, but to lower the dance budgets.
MAKE THEM LESS EXPENSIVE DANCES. Student Con-
gress -will admit that if this had been a successful season, they
would have considered scheduling a Junior prom and possibly

“College of Tomorrow”

Topic of Discussion

Have you wondered what the
“College of Tomorrow” will be
like?. Thissubject has been chosen
the topic of discussion of the Edu-
cation Committee of the American
Association of University Women
for their meeting on March 7, at
the Frick School Auditorium.

Among the professional experts
who will participate "in the dis-
cussion on the problem and the
challenge of education is Dr. S.
P. Franklin of the University of
Pittsburgh. Those who attend the
meeting will learn of the new
trends of education, ideas on what
features of our accelerated col-
lege program may be retained,
what features will be added, what
balance achieved between voca-
tional arrd cultural curricula, and
on new trends in teacher educa-
tion.

In The Pitt News’ cartoon off

last week, Jack Ice printed “Pitt
ain’t what it used to be." H-ow

true, said the little man in the 

blue suit in the back row in the
third seat in the balcon'y.\It cer-
tainly ain’t. Former Pitt ‘boys
home on‘ leaves and furloughs
comment on the situation almost
immediately. They say something’s
wrong.

It’s almost strange what makes it

college. We’re here to get an edu-
cation, -but We’re here to have a
little fun, too. We have four last
years of tearing around, of fra-

ternity parties and dances, of not V

worrying’ too much about any-’

thing. After those four years, we ~

start facing serious responsibili-
ties and our generation is
going to have plenty of them.
Now, it ‘has been said just a few
lines back, that we have four-
years of dances. At Pitt, that has
become a farce. '

In 1901, the Courant, the cur-
rent Pitt newspaper, published an
account of the ﬁrst junior pr-om,
held in the gymnasium on the top
ﬂoor of the College building. The
six coeds in the school at that time
had taught the boys to dance, and

everyone had a gala time. After-- ~

wards, the committee found there
was a three-dollar‘ proﬁt on the
dance. I 

That story is actual. Did anyone
care about the proﬁt? No! The
fact that the students enjoyed
themselves was the main concern.

So now, when we need dances,
when we really need social at.
fairs, we’re stymied. Someone has

failed to realize that there’s a.

possibility of college students be-
coming too» serious. In the good
-ole’ days, the. kids ran rampant
and still kept up with their
studies. Why, even as far back as
1895, there was an article in- the

Cou'rant—“The attempt to blow , "

up the chapel did not result so
successfully as the Sophs antici-
pated.” 
Probably the ﬁ-rst thing some-,
one will do i.s go on the prowl for
some dynamite. (Now, lissen!)

What the boys on leaves and
furloughs have said is, “You kids
just -aren’t having any good fun.”
We don’t know what coll-ege is
really like. College spirit left with

the fellows. Our dances were the

last vestige of pre-war days.
Let us keep them!

  Ballad Program

.Ri-chard Chase, Virginia repre-

sentative of the Country Dance‘

society, will present a program of
ballads and Jack tales on Monday,

February 26, in Room 324 of the

Claithedral at 10:30 o’clock.

Mr. Chase, a native of Profﬁt,
Virginia, is collecting the folk
tales of the past which have not
yet been published. It is not his-
tory tales of actual happenings

S , that are being sought, but word-

of-mouth tales, solChase has been
searching for individual citizens
in the South who remember “the
. the
old. impossible tales with just
enough truth thrown in for sea-
soning.”

Mr. Chase has organized a drive
in the South whereby school
teachers, principals, and pupils are
helping to locate -traditional tales
in their communities.

Many states have some part in
-this heritage of traditional tales,
Chas-e says. He hopes to expl-ore
eventually many other states,

Dr. Lemley Has
More Trouble!  

(Con’t from page 1, col. 1)
(including summer semesters) he
was ready to rgceive his diploma.
But it was rnid—year, and Clay-
Battalle doesn’t have graduation
then. So when June rolled around
he returned for his diploma with
a half-year of pre-dental work at
the University of, West Virginia
already behind him.

His classmates have never let
‘Lemley forget his age, but he
hasn’t minded. Even when the
professional d e n t a l fggaicrnity,
Delta Sigma Delta, presented him
with a rattle at their dinner party
for seniors, he came up smiling.
He carried it in his pocket during
graduation exercises, and intends
to save it as a good luck charm
while in the Navy. The climax to
this teasing came at the same ban-
quet. -A skit was presented, show-
ing Dr. Lemley in a post-war
schoolhohse pointing out to the
high sshool principal the classes
which interested him. The prin-
cipal asked, “Do you want to take
these classes or teach them?” And
it was a good question, for if Lem-
ley decides to practice dentistry
in Pennsylvania after his twenty-
ﬁrst lbirthday, he’ll have to go
back to high school for two more
years.
Dr. Lemley is now on a ﬁfteen-
day leave. But he’s probably at
his family’s farm in Fairview,
West Virginia, reading How to
Become Secretary of the Navy in
Ten Easy Lessons.

Pitt group since that time.
First produced in Munich in

it is a masterful character drama.

Hedda, who has the title role,
is a bored and maladjusted wom-
an, product of a modern society
which has emancipated her from
bearing a ‘urge family of children
and has given her nothing to take
the place of the old duties and re-
sponsibilities. Prey to restlessness
and envy, she has married a
young scholar, Dr. George Tes-
man, not for love but in hopes
that he will get a professorship
and rise to prominence. Wishing
for comfort and security, she ﬁnds
that she -has married into genteel
poverty. She also ﬁnds that her
husband’s promise is greater than
his actual accomplishment. His
friend Eilert Lovborg, has already
outstripped him ‘by publishing a
book which has won critical ac-
claim and by having an even more
promising book about to be
printed.
The irony in all this is that
Eilert is a former admirer of
Hedda, a man whom she has
spurned and wh-om she eventually
ruins. ‘Dissipated and unstable in
action, Eilert has been reclaimed
for society and the world of schol-
arship by Mrs. Elvsted, H‘edda’s
former schoolmate. There is a
sharp dramatic contrast between
the two women. Hedda is afraid
of life, not merely bored by it.
Mrs. Elvsted has courage to face
life’s responsibilities —— courage
born of her love for Eilert.
Dr. Tesman, the obtuse scholar,
fails to notice his wife’s lack of
love and sympathy, even when
she insults his beloved Aunt Julia
by pretending to mistake her new
bonnet-for that of the servant
Berta. Nor does he perceive that
Judge Brack, a.r-ogue, is scheming
to ingratiate himself with Hedda.
Tesman is content merely to W-or-
ship his wife and to arrange ma-
terials for his history of civiliza-
tion. V
Unable to adjust herself ‘to life,
Hedda satisﬁes her sadistic in-
stincts by destroying the happi-
ness of Mrs. Elvsted an-d .ruining
the career of Eilert. At length she
is the victim of her own scheming,
for she falls eventually into the
power of Judge Brack. Ibsen’s
decision to have‘ her ﬁnally shoot
herself with her father’s pistol is
perhaps the least satisfying part
of the drama. -

Pitt Aids on History
Of Engineer Corps

The University recently signed
a contract with the United States‘
War department, whereby the his- 9
tory department has agreed to pre-‘
pare an ofﬁcial history of the war- ,
time research‘ and development of A
the Engineer Corps.‘ .

Since the beginning of the pres
ent war, a number of new items, A
such as the tank-dozer, odographri
and airplane landing mats, have‘
been developed. The Engineersf
Corps desires a complete history

of these scientiﬁc and technologi-
cal developments.

Dr. John W. Oliver, head of the C
history department. will serve as.”
director of the project. Dr. John J
Geise, professor of history, has
been appointed chief historian of
the staff, and will be aided by“
three assistants. The research
and writing will be carried on at
Fort Belvoir, Virginia, ’center of L
the development of all equipment‘ ‘ A
for Army Engineers. The com-
mittee plans to complete the proj-
ect within one year. This is the
ﬁrst contract of its kind to be
signed;

  
  
   
    
   
    
  
   
   
   
   
   
   
    
     
 
  
  
    
     
  
     
   
     
    
 
 
  
     
    
  
   
   
   
  
  
  
    
  
  
  
  
  
   
  
 
   
  
  
 
 
  
  
 
  
  
  
  

would only spoil" it for those of
you who will be seeing Hedda
Gabler for the ﬁrst time. You will I
ﬁnd it exciting and full of dra-
matic surprises. As Hedda re-,
marks in one scene, the villa in,
which the events take place has
“an air of mortality.” In this villa
the “boredom which Hedda ﬁnds
insupporfable gives rise to dark
acts of cruelty. In her warped,/'
mind, she ﬁn-ds pleasure in the
mental torture of those who are
nearest to her. But although her
actions are spiteful and anti-
social, she is so skillfully drawn ‘
that she elicits our sympathy. She
could be any one of us at war
with ourselves and our environ-
ment. Hedda Gabler.s are exist-ent
even in contemporary America. 1
Try" not to miss this play
when it is given in the Stephen
Foster Memorial on Friday,
March 9 and Saturday, March
10, at 8:15 p. m.
If the cast brings out the best
that is in t'he drama, you will,

The purpose of the Cathedral
was eloquently expressed by
Ch-ancellor Bowman, when he
said: “The building must be more
than a schoolhouse. It must be a
symbol of the life that Pittsburgh
has wanted to live.”

According to estimates of
authoritative engineers and archi-
tects, the Cathedral o-f Learning
will last against natural disinteg-
ration for at least ﬁve hundred
years. Five hundred years is a
long time when one stops to real-
ize that it has not been 500 years
since Columbus opened a new era
of
of the vast world to the west.

The ageless character of the
building is best expressed in the
following words of Agnes L. Star-
rett, University historian: “The
Cathedral of Learning tells its
own story better than any words
can tell it. In material actuality
and in spiritual atmosphere, it
tells the story of Western Penn-
sylvania. Roofed deep in Western
Pennsylvania rock, towering
above Western Pennsylvania hills,
it stands for the intellectual and
spiritual hopes of generations of
men made visible in stone.”

There will be a meeting of the
Pre-Social work club today in the
Group work room on the 32nd
ﬂoor of the Cathedral at 3:30. The
speaker will be a repres_entative
of the Camp Fire girls.

Lovern Discusses

British Rationing

Dr. John A. Lovern of the Brit-
ish Food Mission spoke before the
biochemical seminar in Thaw hall
last week. ‘He outlined Great Brit-
ain’s wartime rationing program
and stated that the general level
of health in that country is higher
than in peacetime.

Under the direction of the Min-
istry of Foods, babies, children
under certain ages, and particular
adult groups‘ receive a supple-
mental ration, including fresh
eggs, a pint of milk daily, and
oranges, which are for children
only.

‘Three classiﬁcations of rations
make the distribution of foods
equal. A basic ration, for which
individual register at a given re-
tail store in their neighborhood,
consists of such items as bread,
meat, butter, margarine, dried
eggs, and tea. The retailer is sup-
plied by the Ministry of Foods. By
this method’, “queues,” or butter
lines, are eliminated.

Other items are rationed ac-
cording to a point system which
is similar to ours.

Sgt. Lehman titles his “Pay-off

we have brought the war to Japan.

 compares the landing on Leyte
with the landing in Sicily, saying
that “as the Germans lost their
vwar with the breaching of Sicily,
so the Japs lost their war with the
new beachhead on Leyte.”

Sgt. Lehman gives a graphic ac-
count of American operations
which resulted in gaining the of-
fensive after General MacArthur
left Corregidor when American

iforces in the Paciﬁc were “scarce-
ly large enough to assault Coney
Island.”

Cpl. M-cElw.ain, former sports

partment which announced that
Pitt students bought enough war
bonds during the Sixth War Loan
drive to ﬁnance the building of
three “ducks,” two-and-a-half-
ton amphibian trucks costing
$8,275 apiece. The goal set by the
War Finance committee of the
University, headed by Jacqueline
Goodman, C, for the drive at Pitt
last November 20 .-to December 16
was the purchase of one “duck.”
In recognition of this contribution,
placques will be placed in the
ducks, designating Pitt as their
donor. .

I just found this is Buddy’s last
column before the navy. Since I
just had the chance to say “How
do you do”, it’s a pity to say, “So
nice to have met you so soon.” But
such is life! Anyway, goodby and
good luck to a good columnist.

If it is news you want, rushing
will ﬁll the bill in just a couple
of weeks. At the moment, frats
are busy dreaming up parties
really “out of this world.”

With all the hustle and bustle of

rushing preparations, Zeta Tau
Alpha. found time to have a dance
at their house last Friday night.

Today being Valentine Day,
what better way is there to cele-
brate than have a dance. Who is
having this dance? Why, the Phi
Mus.

Beta. Sig president, Romaine
Taddio, is taking next week end
off to visit their Beta Gamma
chapter at Westminster College.
P Three new Phi Sigs were re-
cently welcomed into the active
chapter. They are past pledges,
Anita Kimball, Betty Jane Linden,
and Evelyn Wolk. “Mothers and
daughters are getting together for
a party because they see each
other so seldom with all Pitt’s
activities taking place,” explained
Phi Sig, Betty Udman. She was
joking,-of course?

Chi O’s Nancy Jean Yant and
Lee Mclnerney went to visit Chi
Omega’s Nu -Gamma chapter at
Penn, State last week end. They
said they really had a great time.

The TPA’s initiated Loretta
Snyder and Mary Lou Barrett on
Sunday. Before the initiation
ceremony, the girls attended ten
o’cl-ock ‘mass at St. Panl’s Cathe-
dral in a body and had breakfast
at the Fairfax Hotel. Miss Ellen
Geyer, Theta Phi Alpha’s faculty
adviser, Father Kraus, and many
alumnae attended the ceremony.

This being “Hello Week” I feel
rather foolish saying “Goodbye,”
but goodbye it is for I’m leaving
Pitt this week. They called me
down to the draft board to volun-
teer, and I’ll be going in a few
days. But before I do, I’d like to
be serious for a moment and take
this opportunity to say goodbye to
all of the wonderful people I’ve
met here at Pitt. I’ve had a lot of
fun here, -and I’ll never forget it.

Now to the more important bus-
iness of what’s new in the frater-
nities. The Delts held a dance at
the house last Saturday for Valen-
tine’s day. They also initiated
Milton Cleland a n d Emerson
Tempas at their Monday meeting.

The »Phi Delts saved electricity
last Fridayevening with a candle-
light dance at their house. They
were also celebrating Valentine’s
day.

To celebrate my departure, the
Phi Eps are holding a big brawl
for me——at.my house, of all places.
You'd think that they were glad
to see me jgo—-—????

The Phi Gams held a Bobby Sox
dance on Saturday night. The
dance was in honor of Valentine's
day, of course.

Just to be different the PiKAs
also had a Valentine’s day dance
last Saturday. It looks as though
Valentines are taking the place of
tea dances.

“Pi Lams welcome into the fra-
ternity ﬁve newly initiated broth-
ers, Sam Forber, Edwin Karelity,
Frank -Roth, Nathan Watzman and
Milton Westerman. Former mem-
bers, Al Marcus, Jules Kamm, and
Bob Lichtenstul, are also wel-
comed back.

The Sigma Chis had a bowling
party last Wednesday,’which fea-
tured a contest between the actives
and pledges. The actives won,
but after all, what could the poor
pledges do?

Just one more thing before I
close this for good. In case anyone
has wondered about the big feud
between Dick Barnhart and my-
self, we were only kidding. I
found that it was a swell way to
get my name into Pittpourri.

Frank Morris, freshman guard,
left for the Army Air Forces yes-
terday. Morris did very well in
holding down the guard position
and will be missed considerably
on the defense. Tay Malarkey,
captain of the Phantoms, will re-
main on the bench tonight. Tay’s
knee is in very bad shape since he
received a jolt in the New Wil-
mington game thatpsent him ﬂy-
ing up into the stands. Since the
renewal of his injury Tay has
played on in the relief role.

lEven though the visitors won’t
be at full strength they have
found suitable substitutes in
Kashlakf and Bair. Kashlak was
the star forward on Duquesne’s
State Championship floor squad
last year and should feel ,at home

.on the stadium fl-oor. Subbing for
Frank Morris will be Carl Mich-
alik, former Ford City player.
Michalik has seen action in almost
every-fray and Dr. -Carlson feels
that he is the man to take over
the guard post. Phil Marder will
continue to ﬁll the injured Malar-
key’s shoes.

Starting for the peppy Phan-
toms will be Nate Apple and Phil
Marder at the forwards, both
future dentists. Jacobson, who will
do the jumpillg, is also in Dent
school. Freshmen Dodo Canterna
and Michalik will be at the guards.
Hank Zellers will be put into
service as soon as the need arises.
If the Carlsonmen expect to be
district champs they must beat the

I Titans who now lead the pack.

Panthers and State

Meet Next

Saturday

Pitt will be out to make it a clean sweep over Penn State
this year which will help make up for the double setback the

Lions gave the Panthers last season.

In their ﬁrst meeting at

the Stadium the Panthers sent the Sttaters home with a 58-41
setback, the most decisive loss they suffered this season. Starring
for the Phantoms was little Sam Consentino who bucketed 3
long shots in the ﬁnal periodand 12 points all told.

Both the ROTC and Varsity
teams of the University have ﬁred

There will be a Pep Rally on

hour, 12:30 -o’clock. All stu-
dents are invited; to attend and
prepare for the West Virginia
basketb.all game.

9 Coach John Lawther used his

customary zone defense but it
couldn’t stop Pitt.‘ The Phantoms
put in long shots from all corners
of the floor and those that bounc-
ed off the banking board were
grabbed off by Hank Zeller, who
tossed in 14 points. Pitt broke
into the lead within the first min-
ute of play and failed to lose it,
even thougli the Staters tied it up
twice. 3 »

Pitt will» have a hard job ahead
if they expect to defeat State on
their home ﬂoor. State is accus-
tomed to their huge court which
puts the visitors to a great dis-
advantage. Despite this, State is
also out for revenge having suf-
fered but one defeat since the
Pitt loss, that one at the hands
of Army. State’s zone defense kept
Army’s scoring down and the
Cadets didn’=t gain victory until
the ﬁnal minutes of play. '

Doctor Carl-son is looking for-
ward to a hard struggle with the
b-oys from Nittany, and expects
to have a surprise for them. Tay
Malarkey is being kept idle in or-
der to be in top shape against
State, for ‘his accurate shooting
will -be .a big factor in deciding the
winner. This contest on Saturday
night in Ni-ttany territory will
head the district card and close
out an ancient rivalry until next
season.

Now the squad was packed aboard a special train

they’d climax a perfect season and tuck another national cham-

The Army wasn’t too tough that

year and so Notre Dame was pretty conﬁdent. The boys weren’t.
the only guilty ones; :the papers had made the Sons of South

1 Bend a 4-touchdown favorite.
“Rock” had predicted a win for his boys.
The rumbling express, he’d sai-d¢

to the reporters who crowded
around “Yes. We ought to take
that one tomorrow. We’r-e about
four touchdowns better than that
Army bunch.”

The day of the game dawned
and Yankee Stadium was packed
to its dim recesses. Elevateds an-d
subways had poured thousands
toward the gates. The Army band
was playing martial airs; the
Cadet Corps was booming out

- cheers as only they can boom. The

-sporting world waited eagerly for
news of Notre Dame slaughtering
the Army. That news never came.
Instead the wires crackl-ed with
one of the greatest upsets in grid-
iron hi-story. It was emblazoned in
the headlines of every Sunday
morning sheet in the country.
ARMY HAD WALLOPED NOTRE
DAME 27-0. It stunned the im-
agination . . . they had done the
impossible.

There was. a stillness of death
in the N-otre Dame dressing room.
A trainer stepped on a loose board
under the showers—it rattled
like ‘thunder. The squad sat about,

tense, ti-ght-lipped, -on trunks,
‘ benches, ﬂoors. “Rock” called
sharply, “Everybody in close.”

They sprang quickly, huddled in
a circle; were quiet again. He be-
gan, “No alibi; nobody’s fault;
they scored and we couldn’t. All
right, season’s over. You sh-owed
’em how to win———now show ’em
how to take one on the chin and
shake it off. I don’t want any
whining. Forget about it . . .
you’ll have another whack at ’em
next year. And don’t try to drink
the town dry, although I suppose
the alumni and student body won’t
be too sweet on us now.”

When the train slid into South
Bend next day, the squad dreaded
ﬁling out of the coaches because
they felt they’d let the school
d-own. Well, the school didn’t

Even the usually pessimistic
In the club car of

think so. The team shuffled onto
the station platform and found a
huge wel-coming mob waiting for
them. There was everything from
the strains of “Cheer, cheer for
Old Notre Dame . . .” to a howl-
ing bunch of frenzied college kids
ﬁghting to carry “Rock” and the
boys on their shoulders. Gulped
one ‘half-dazed second stringer,
“Golly, I thought we’d lost.” Of
course they had, but the student
body had wanted to show them,
that win or lose, the school was
behind them. It was one of the
ﬁnest gestures that the grizzled
old -coach had ever experienced,
and tears welled up in his pierc-
ing, steel—blue eyes. That was
Notre Dame and an insight into
why itis so great.

Here at Pitt, we have one of
the best basketball squads in the
East, coached by one of the most
famous mentors the game has ever
known. Sure, we lost to Army,
but they’re the number one team
of the nation. We played at their
ﬁeld house before 2,500 screaming
Cadets. Yes, and we dropped one
to Westminster. Do you know

-why? They were a better team,

that night, and they pl.ay to win.
Malarkey was carried out in the
second. quarter. He had a bad
knee-—Westminster knew that. He
was bumped into the second r-ow
of the stands . . . the pain knifed
all the Way to his shoulder. Was
it intenti-on.al? How would I know?
However, remember, these boys
play to win.

Tonight that same Westminster
outﬁt is here at -the stadium.
the district championship rides on
the outcome. They need YOU out
there backing them to the hilt.
Ask them, the boys who played
on the Plains, how it felt when
Cadet cheers rocked the place. The
blue chips are down, will you be
there?

Morris Leaves
For Air Corps

 

Frank Morris, Freshman Guard

Frank Morris, regular guard on
Doctor Carlson’-s phantom quintet,
was called up from the Army Air
Corps Reserve yesterday. He was
one of the two starting freshmen
in the Panther lineup———the otherI
being Dodo Canterna high-sc-oring
forward. He hails from Avalon
where he played on both the foot-
ball and basketball varsity squads.
In football he was on the first
team as a guard in his senior
year, while in basketball, he was
a varsity performer at forward in
both his junior and senior years.
In his senior year, Avalon was the
class “B” WPIAL champion. At
the same time, Frank was the
squad’s high scorer.

As he leaves, the Panthers ﬁnd
themselves with an empty guard
slot on the eve of the all-import-

St.

urday before more than 18,000

in the bribery case which resulted
in the indictment of three ga-m-

I have just returned from visit-
ing the bands playing in the the-
aters of New York, and I would
like to take you on a little tour
with me. The ﬁrst stop is the
Strand theater, where Artie Shaw
is heally packing them in. As you
remember, Mr. Shaw joined the
navy shortly after Pearl Harbor.
He was given the rank of chief
petty officer, sent d-own to ‘Hono-
lulu, an-d put in charge of all navy
bands. After being discharged he
went to Hollywood where he
worked in the capacity of a musi-
cal director, and now he has just
formed a new seventeen-piece
band. His present piano player is
a Pittsburgh boy, Dodo Mar-most,
a «graduate of Peabody High
School. The audience went for
Dodo in a big way. Featured with
the band is Roy “Little Jazz” Eld-
ridge, the famed negro trumpet
player, who put on an exception-
ally ﬁne p-erformance when he
soloed on Solitude. The c-omplete
show ran f-or 'forty—ﬁve minutes
in which Mr. Shaw played some
of the old favorites such as Begin
the Beguine and Stardust. In my
estimation Artie’s technique on
the clarinet is still unsurpassed
by anyone in the popular musical
ﬁeld of today. The w.arm welcome
he received at the Strand indi-
cates that Artie is well on the way
toward regaining the great popu-
larity that he and his band had
before he left for the navy.

The next stop is at the Para-
mount theater wh-ere another
great clarinetist, Woody Herman,
is appearing after making three
pictures in Hollywood. Mr. Her-
man concentrated on his singin-g
rather than his playing and he
went over very well in such num-
bers as Accentuate the Positive,
and Who Dat Up Dere. The out-
standing feature of his show was
a novelty solo performed by his
bass player. A new addition to
the Herman tribe is in the way of
a female xylophonist.

After leaving “the man who
plays the blues,” we will walk up

During Spare Time

Ker-ash! Clatter, clack,-ping!
Calmly and undaunted Tony Ama-
dio turned to gape at his tray of
sturdy Tuck Shop dishes garnish-
ing the floor of “the Red.” Then
he carried them out, wiping choc-
olate pudding from his white
jacket, completely forgetting his
interview. Oh, well . . . Tony is
just one of many‘ of the Pitt stu-
dents who are working during
their spare hours. Some, like him,
are employed by the cafeteria,
others by the Building and
Grounds department, and many
more have jobs independent of the
school. Everyone knows the Tuck
Shop staff — Johnnie (Cheerio
O’Leary) Pager, Tony Amadio,
Dodo Canterna. and Woiie.

Then there are the library
pages, those silent, unseen senti-
nels of the deadline, inight—before-
ﬁnal student body, who produce in
jig time from the stacks of 350,000
books, the response to those cata-
log room slips.

Some of those who are holding
down after-class jobs are prepar-
ing themselves for their intended
professions—bus. ads. in banks
and business oﬁices, pre-meds and
pre-nurses in labs and doctors’ of-
ﬁces, journalism and English ma-
jors in newspaper work. The list
is endless.

Then, too, there is the isolated
case of Bob Nagle who tried, al-
though vainly, to work during the
Christmas vacation. It seems that
he objected to the cruelty of
punching a time clock.

a few blocks to the Roxy theater
where Louis “Satchamo” Arm-
strong is being featured on the
stage. Although Mr. Armstrong
only played a few numbers, he
performed splendidly. He conﬁned
his music mainly to Boogie-
Woogie and the blues for which
he is famous.

Credit must be given to these
b.ands for their wonderful per-
formance in spite of the fact that
so many of their featured men
have entered the service.

Hello! This is to prove that

we’re keeping up with the times
and Hello Week. You’ve seen
those big colored posters about
the whole thing all over school.
So let’s all get behind it and put
it over with . . . but why go on.
You know what we mean.
The Phi Eps got the jump on
Hello Week by starting it oﬁ last
Friday at their Open House. How-
ard (Eager Beaver for Chairman)
Lupovitz kept running around the
twelfth ﬂoor Webster Hall Pilot
house encouraging people to be
charming.

It’s been a rough week, as we
stop to think of it. Of coursewe
were all registered by last Monday
and started going to classes this
Monday, but there’s a horrible
strain connected with shaking off
the inertia of mid-semester vaca-
tion and acquiring the inertia of
the Tuck Shop gang.

We had a ﬁght with the new
Campus Editor the other day.
Seems she wants us to turn in our
column on Friday afternoon instead
of Monday. On being ﬁrmly refus-
ed, in spite of our pleas that late
Monday afternoon from 4:30 to 5
was the time we got our inspira-
tions, we sulked in the corner the
rest of the afternoon. With her
chiding that we were becoming
“set in our ways” ringing in‘ our
ﬁappy ears, we decided to get
even with her throughthe column.
So there!

Speaking of the column—what
you’re lookin’ at, stupid——Bill

dles) Veenis came in while we
were writing this. We just leered
at him—he’s powerless to do any-
thing about it. Wish we had juicy
little item he’d like to blue-pencil.

And while we’re on the subject
of service men (Yeoman Veenis
soon, in case you’re puzzled) we
saw an o1d—timer in the Tuck
Shop: Shelby Castleman, former
Fiji who was at Pitt in the good
old days when women knew what
men were.

But enough of this———to kick
aside the three sacks of fan mail
we sent ourselves this week and to
get on with what few little inno-
cent items that will get past the
999 censors we have. This week’s
Valentine couple. is Ellie Lynch
and Johnny‘ (“Choppah”) Davis.
Problem of last Saturday evening
was how both of them could be
wearing fraternity pins.

Got on the street car the other
day and who was there leaning
wearily on her cane but Lavender
Lungee (see last week) Dinny
Dinsmore. The man in front of
whom she was standing—he was
about 89-ﬁnally heaved out of
his seat for her . . so we bor-
rowed the caneand moved a little
farther back in the car, plees.
Moral: Always carry a cane on
street cars. You sit more.

Lt. and Mrs. Joseph Benko--she
used to be Barbara Rush—were in
from New Jersey last week visit-
ing her Tri-Delt sisters. We over-
heard some frustrated ghoul re-
marking, “Tch, Tch. Married al-
most a year and still holding
hands!”

One of the sharpest enro-llees; at

As of a week ago, Dottie (Honey

no words, but he doesn’t see it her
