Black Panther tells

of civil rights fight

By Milt Klopfer
Senior Staff Writer

Few people during the 1960s
would have ever connected
10,000 frozen chickens with the
struggle for the political
empowerment of blacks, but
former Black Panther Chairman
Bobby Seale used chickens and
other groceries as incentives in a
massive voter-registration drive.

Seale spoke Thursday night in
the William Pitt Union Ballroom.
He told the story of purchasing,
bagging and giving away 10,000

bags of groceries to the black
residents of Watts, Calif. The only
requirements to receive the food
were for the residents to be tested
for sickle-cell anemia and to
register to vote in the city’s
elections. The groceries were
gone in 45 minutes, and 10,000
blacks had been registered to
vote.

“You’ve got to pay attention to
the fine particulars of how to
organize,” said Seale. “The racists
are lying. The black community
can do anything [it] wants to

Gulf War causes increased attacks on Arab—Americans

By Rebecca Wilkins
Staff Writer

An intense racist campaign againstArab-
Americans is growing in America,
according to Kate Daher, a member of the
Socialist Worker’s Party and of the Oil,
Chemical, and Atomic Worker’s Union.

Daher was the guest speaker at a ‘

presentation called “Protest Against Racist
Attacks Against Arabs in America,”
sponsored Saturday by the Pathfinder
Bookstore in East Liberty.

“The attacks against Arab—Americans in
this country and also against people of
Arab descent in other countries who are

Panel says support of

participating in the U.S.—sponsored alliance
against Iraq have come under increasing
discrimination, harassment and attack as
this war has developed," said Michael
Pennock, a steelworker from East Liberty
who attended the protest.

Daher said the FBI has a significant role
in this racist campaign.

“People who are active in this movement
against the war, who are Arabic or not
Arabic, are being contacted by the FBI,”
said Daher. , g

“This isn’t the first time they’veitargeted
individuals or organizations, nor is it the
first time that the U.S.‘government has
gone on a racist campaign against a

particular people," she said.

Daher cited the anti-Japanese
propaganda used during World War II, as
well as FBI attempts at disrupting the civil-
rights movement and women's
movements.

Daher had advice for those who had
been contacted by the FBI.

“You don’t have to answer to the FBI.
Anything you say will be used against you.
If you say ‘I don’t know anything,’ they
will say, ‘What is it you don’t know
anything about?”’ Daher said.

Daher said she had information from
the Center for Constitutional Rights about
the right to remain silent when questioned

by the FBI and about specific instances of
discrimination against Arab—Americans.

Daher said she knew of Arab-Americans
who were visited by the FBI at their places
of employment and at their homes, and
who were harassed, in one instance for
five hours, by security police at airports
only because they were obviously of Arab
origin or were speaking Arabic.

“The response of the Socialist Worker’s
Party, the Young Socialist’s Alliance and of

many students is to organize against the"

war and to organize against the assault on

our democratic rights at home,” said Daher.

“One of the best ways to do it is to

' The American public will
continue to support the war in
the Persian Gulf even if there are
massive U.S. casualties, said
military officers from the U.S.
Army War College.

“The news media would
desperately like you to believe
that [support would decrease],
but I’m not sure historically that
necessarily happens to be true.
The American population
supported the Vietnam War for
many, many years even after it
wasobvious» it was being fought

stupidly,” Lt. Col. Joe Dixon of
the U.S. Air Force said.

Dixon and three other officers
from the War College participated
in a Current Affairs Panel on
Thursday at Pitt and addressed
questions from the audience
about the Persian Gulf war and
Eastern Europe.

Support for the war is highly
visible, especially on college
campuses, said Col. Arthur
Hadley, a Middle East specialist.
“I have not seen the support
[before] —— the number of yellow
ribbons the number of
American ﬂags  the students on
campus wearing pro-military

war visible on college campuses

buttons  I just didn’t see that in
the ’60s,” said Hadley. “The feeling
is really genuine on campus.”

The press needs to be more
cautious when reporting the war
in the gulf, said several of the
officers. “The news media tends
to be more -concerned about
getting the news out before 5
o’clock than necessarily drawing
a balanced conclusion from the
sources,” said Dixon.

“There must be a responsibility
to sift through those facts and
ask, ‘Why did that occur. ”’ said
Hadley. .

when it puts its mind to it.”

This story of food and votes
was one of many examples Seale
gave of Black Panther community
action. Seale told the audience of
approximately 200 that although
the Black Panthers were both
armed and revolutionary, they
never forgot the need to have
grass-roots organization and su-
pport in the black community.

Through‘free meals and

preventative ‘health-care
programs, the Black Panthers
spread their message of
revolution, centered around what
Seale saw as the basic inalienable
rights of blacks. A .

“The points were freedom for
blacks. Period,” he said, quoting
the original 1965 program of the
Black Panthers. “Employment for
all blacks. Period. Decent
housing. Period. An end to
exploitation of blacks  The right
to an education  The right not
to be drafted.”

At the end of the Black Panther’s
program was two paragraphs out
of the American Declaration of

Independence, which Seale
quoted from memory with a
passion that set the audience
applauding.

“Those two paragraphs told us
that we had the right to kick ass
and change shit,” said Seale. A

In invoking this right, the Black
Panthers also invoked another
basic American right: the right to
bear arms. Scale and co-founder
Huey Newton meticulously
studied gun law in preparation to
defend their right to possess and
carry weapons.

“Self-defense is only an act of
intelligence,” said Seale, quoting
Malcolm X. As Seale expected,
the combination of guns and
rights resulted in deaths of both
Black Panthers and police officers,
a fact that he did not try_ to
conceal. ‘

Seale mimed the actions of the

‘participants in the shooting of a

police officer, of which Newton
was acquitted.

Seale visited Pitt as part of the
Black Action Society’s celebration
of Black History Month.

“I really enjoyed the talk,” said

Bobby Seale was a co-founder of the Black Panthers.

activist Vince Eirene. “Even
though I am a disciple of non-
violence, I respect the courage to
fight against oppression of the
people.”

Pitt graduate William
Blackmun, who sold Black
Panther literature in 1968, told
Seale during the question-and-
answer session that he had waited
20 years to meet him.

“What he did had a profound
effect on me as far as committing
myself and learning,” said

Blackmun who now works as a
consultant to programs for the
hungry and homeless.
Sophomore Eric Nixon, a pre-
med major, said he was inspired

_ by Seale’s words as well. “He

enhanced my African-American
pride and made me want to go
back to help my community,” he
said. “When I become a doctor,
I’m not living in the suburbs. I’m
going back to the inner city to
deal with the drug problem and
malicious things like that.”

Asian studies groups celebrate Chinese New Year

By Megan Bertino
Staﬂ" Writer

The students currently on trial
for their involvement in the
Tiananmen Square incident in
1989 were the focus of Pitt groups
celebrating the Chinese New Year.

“I hope [China] lets the world-

know what’s happening instead

of shutting the door,” saidjennifer
Bloom, a sophomore majoring in
Chinese and economics.

The Asian Studies Club and the
Asian Studies Program held a
dinner Thursday celebrating th
Chinese New Year. ‘

Tim Xie, a teacher of Chinese at
Pitt, said he was skeptical about
China allowing the world to know

what is happening. He skeptical
about the timing of the trial.

“The Chinese government has
taken the opportunity to try the
students while the U.S. [and the
allied coalition] are at war.” Xie
also said he is concerned about
the stiff four— to seven-year prison
sentences the students are
receiving.

Chris Macriney, a sophomore
majoring in Chinese and math,
said, “It’s very unfortunate
[Chinese students] don’t have the
freedom of speech we do.”

The festivities‘ were held at a
dinner. celebrating the Year of
the Sheep. In China, the New
Year’s dinner is a large buffet
served one course at a time.

Thursday’s dinner was a smaller
scale of the traditional buffet.
The room was decorated with
red streamers and gold balloons.
Signs written in Chinese were
hung on the walls. The signs read
“GongXi,” meaning “Good Luck,”
and “Facai," meaning “Get Rich.”
Others said “Happy Spring” and
“Congratulations.”

suqr Writer

Leon Khaimovich graduated from high
school in Moscow and then lived in
Lithuania from 1981 until September 1988,
when he left as a refugee.

Khaimovich, a graduate student in
sociology at Pitt, headed a discussion
about the current situation in the Baltic
republics at Wednesday’s Soviet round

~ table.

about Lithuania’s ﬁght for independence.
Lithuania declared its independence from
the Soviet Union in March 1990.
“Independence is a waiting game,”
Khaimovich said.

He outlined two arguments concerning
Lithuania’s struggle for independence. The
first was that Lithuania should remain
patient.

Khaimovich said that many believe the
Soviet Union is in a state of disarray and

independence when the Soviet economy
falls apart. Although Lithuania was
formally granted economic independence
in January 1988, the republic still could
not break away from the Soviet Union,
according to Khaimovich.

“To revive the economy was impossible
without removing the old—sty1e authorities
from their offices,” Khaimovich said.

Secret meetings with a democratic forum
were held in Lithuania, despite threats

held to remove communism from the

Soviet Union.

Khaimovich said economic turmoil in
the Soviet Union exists because 82 percent
of the work force is involved with the
military. ,

“The military consumes the entire
country,” Khaimovich said. This causes
the stagnation of the Lithuanian economy,

. he said.

Elevating the handling of the

While Hadley said he regretted
the hundreds of Iraqi civilian
deaths during the gulf war, he
said Americans need to keep the
casualties in perspective. “People

decrease in the future if the United
Nations is /willing to become

be out of a job being the ‘world’s
policeman’ if we can get the

As an editor of a newspaper in East
London, South Africa, Woods’ importance
to the struggle for human rights and racial
equality in that country was threefold,
according to friend and fellow activist,

Pitt’s Dennis Brutus. -

First, Woods was among the few in the
white South African media to investigate
what life was really like for the non-whites
discriminated against by the government-
mandated system of segregation called
apartheid.

“[The role of the press] is to always call
attention to oppression and to oppose it,”
said Woods, “to bring it to everyone’s
attention.” , 9

Also, Woods had the courage to keep

speaking out against the SY5tem'_eVen
when the government sought to silence
him by making him a “banned person.

This is a security measure used in Sotllh
Africa in which contact and communicauon
with a given person is severely restricted.

“It’s very unpleasant,” said Woods.
“You’re not allowed to write anY[h”‘8-

C Conditionalpeace?

a Day 31 of the war was almost a day on which the world
could celebrate peace — until the world, to its dismay,
learned to read fine print.

Last Friday, at approximately 6:30 a.m., the world
prepared to rejoice as the Iraqi Revolutionary Council,
essentially a mouthpiece for Saddam Hussein, -announced
that Iraq was willing to pull out of Kuwait. Soon after,
Baghdad Radio announced that in order for this to
happen, several conditions would have to be met by the
world — some new, some not. 1 r

I First and foremost, the Iraqis called for an immediate
cease-fire. Also, the Iraqis demanded that Israel withdraw
from th'et*W‘est Bank and give the Golan Heights back to
Syria. Fzinally, they demanded the withdrawal of allied
forces from Saudi Arabia. These demands have been
tossed around since the crisis began. .

I But Iraq also made new demands. It requested that Syria
pull its troops from Lebanon. Saddam also ordered that

 the United States not only repay Iraq for damages inﬂicted

upon the nation during the bombings but also rebuild the
country as well. In addition, Saddam’ ordered that the

.world lift the freeze on all foreign Iraqi assets.

—After these conditions were met, Saddam said that Iraq
would “comply with U.N. Resolution 660 and withdraw

\ from Kuwait.” . ‘

Unfortunately, there is some fine print in U.N. Resolution

I 660 which Iraq is not only ignoring but is blatantly
E disregarding. This resolution, passed almost immediately

after the Iraqi invasion on Aug. 2, stated that Iraq must
“unconditionally” leave Kuwait. Since the withdrawal
would be conditional, it directly contradicted the resolution.

President Bush immediately called the council’s statement
a “cruel hoax.” Other countries around the world expressed
similar sentiments.

Bush, however, did mention a bright spot in the
proposal. Since the invasion, Iraq has claimed that Kuwait
is a part of Iraq and is no longer a sovereign state. This
statement at least mentioned Kuwait as a sovereign state.

_ Beyond that fractional point, the entire proposal is no

more than a poor joke on the world.

The United States is currently preparing for a ground
offensive against Iraq in order to enforce U.N. Resolution
660 and its subsequent follow—ups. Sooner or later,
although Iraq may be putting up a strong face now, it will
leave Kuwait._ , ‘

The crisis in the Persian Gulf is not a joke. Unfortunately,
this insulting ultimatum constitutes just that.

Everybody in the world wants to see a peaceful resolution
to the conflict. If this is Iraq’s best attempt at peace, the
country could be in for a long, drawn—out conﬂict.

Psychiatric
Upon learning

Lastweek, Gov. Robert Casey
announced his proposed annual
budget for Pennsylvania.
According to in The Pittsburgh
Press, one goal of the budget is to
help the economy.

But if anything, the provisions
in Casey’s budget which relate to
business will do the exact
opposite. They will hurt the
economy. _

For example, Casey wants to
raise the corporate net- income
tax from 8.5 to 10.5 percent. This
will have several negative effects
on business.

For one thing, it will increase
the likelihood of business failures
in the state. It will also discourage
new businesses from being
started in Pennsylvania. In
addition, because businesses will
have to pay more money in taxes,
they will have less money to use
for re-investment and expansion.
Furthermore, much of the
increase in taxation will be passed
on to consumers in the form of
higher prices.

Does Casey really think this
will be good for the economy?

“Economic development”
funding comprises $1.26 billion
of Casey’s proposed budget.
What this means is that the
government will be giving more
than $1 billion in subsidies to
businesses. Instead of having to
work for their money, these
businesses will be getting it for
free. What “economic dev-
elopment” really means is welfare
for corporations.

What we see is that businesses

Daniel
Alman

which create wealth will be
punished by having to pay higher
taxes, while others, which aren't
necessarily being productive, will
be rewarded with subsidies.

I have my own proposal for the
part of the budget that deals with
businesses. All taxes placed on
businesses should be eliminated,
as well as all subsidies.

Without any taxes placed on
businesses, many new businesses,
and thus jobs, would be created
in Pennsylvania.

Without subsidies, businesses
would have only one way to
make money: satisfy their
customers. Having political
inﬂuence would no longer be a
guarantee for proﬁts. Instead,
businesspeople would actually
have to perform real work. '

Of course, I realize that ending
business subsidies alone would
not produce enough savings to
be able to totally eliminate all
taxes placed on businesses.
However, Casey could make
additional spending cuts.

For example, Casey’s budget
includes $82 million for Port
Authority of Allegheny County.
This subsidy and PAT itself should
be eliminated, andit should be
made legal for private companies
to offer mass transit in Pittsburgh.

If our current public-school
system were replaced with a

Casey budget hurts economy

voucher system, in which parents
were given vouchers to send their
children to any private school of
their choice, the state budget
could be cut by approximately
$2.4 billion.

Instead of spending Casey’s
proposed $7.1 million to. improve
public airports, the airports should
be privatized.

The Milk Marketing Board,
which exists primarily to set
minimum milk prices to protect
high-priced milk sellers from
lower-priced competition, uses
up tax dollars for its
administration. This should be
eliminated. ,

There are many other programs
in the budget, too numerous to
list here, which should also be
cut or done away with entirely.
All of these spending cuts would
produce so much savings that in
addition to being able to end all
taxes on businesses, we could
also cut the sales tax and personal-
income tax.

Unfortunately, Casey doesn’t
want to do this. Instead, he wants
to expand the sales tax to cover
cable television, long—distance
interstate phone calls and alcohol
bought in taverns and restaurants.
Casey also wants to raise the
cigarette tax from 18 to 48 cents
per pack.

It is interesting to note that
Casey chose to raise taxes right
after his re-election. Fortunately
for us, Pennsylvania has a two-
term limit for governor.

T bree-pointers and emotional play lead Pitt to win

Miller, Porter bomb away

By Mike Rampa
Sports Editor

With St. John’s using its “sag” defense in an attempt to shut down
Pitt’s inside game Saturday night, the burden of scoring fell to the
Panther perimeter, a backcourt which has been known to “sag” in
the scoring department occasionally.

But it was not to be. Sean Miller and Darelle Porter established
their proficiency from the three-point range with a vengeance and
contributed a combined 38 points (18 from three-point range),
sparking a 94-83 Panther victory in front of 6,798 at Fitzgerald Field
House. With Georgetown’s 63-50 loss to Seton Hall last night, Pitt
(18-8, 7-5 in the Big East Conference) is locked in a virtual three-
way tie for second place in the Big East with the Hoyas (15—8, 7-
5) and the ‘Redmen (17-7, 8-6). St. John's played two more
conference games than either team. .

Miller hit four of six three-pointers andadded a two—point field
goal while making four of four free throws. “To this point, this is
by far one of the biggest games for me. I really wanted to play well,
and I really wanted to win,” Miller said.

The point guard’s intense desire to win this particular game had
its roots in theJan. 19 game with the Redmen in Alumni Hall. Miller
wanted to respond to the less-than-sportsmanlike treatment he
received in New York when he missed the crucial free throw that
would have tied the game at 72.‘ 1

“When you’re in New York City and you miss, you know what
happens. Everyone in the crowd [gives you the ‘choke’ sign], and
a lot of the [St John’s] players were talking to me after I missed,
and I wanted to really respond, and I’m glad I did,” Miller said.

Redmen guard Jason Buchanan was singled out by Miller as the
player that harassed him the most after his free-throw miscue. It
was an action that stuck in Miller’s craw so much that he refused
to shake Buchanan’s hand before the start of Saturday’s game.

The redshirt junior has sunk 48 of 111 shots from three-point
range this season, compared to 22 of 47 from inside the long- range
line. Thus, 69 percent of his field goals have been treys this year.
Pitt career percentage is very similar: 68 percent. Of the 238 FGs
Miller has scored, 162 were three-pointers.

Lady Pant/oers upset by Seton Hall Bttes,

By Rob Mazur

The Universityof Pittsburgh Lady Panthers
were riding a two-game winning streak
entering Saturday’s game’ with the Seton
Hall Bucettes. They had defeated the
Bucettes on their own court earlier this year
70-58, but were denied this time, falling 75-
59. .

The Lady Panthers started with two strikes
against them. Lorri Johnson, Pitt’s No. 2 all-
time leading scorer, was on the bench after
having her knee drained Friday. Pitt Coach
Kirk Bruce said, “Not having Lorri in the

The Pitt wrestling squad wrestled in two
dual meets over the past four days and
came away with one win and one loss.

The‘Panthers, who have a 4-9 record
and aren’t on one of their best wrestling
campaigns, beat Edinboro on Thursday
night 22-19 in an important Eastern
Wrestling League match. It was the
Panthers’ first home victory of the season,
as well as their first league victory.

“We’ve functioned without her before
when she fouls out or we knew she wasn’t
going to play. We just foundout before the
game that she wasn't going to play.”
Injuries to other key players also hurt the
Lady Panthers. Jill McElhinny, a sophomore
forward who started all 29 games last year as
a freshman, has been lost for the year with
a leg injury. She has seen limited playing
time in the last couple of games. Also,
sophomore guard Maureen McConnell
returned to the lineup after being sidelined
for_ the previous two games with a hip

-injury.

“We really couldn’t work Maureen really
hard in practice this week because of her
injury,” said Bruce. “At this time of the year,
players are more susceptible to both injury
and sickness. You just have to coach who

On Saturday, the Panthers traveled to
Clarion University and came home empty-
handed, losing another close match, 21-
16, to the Golden Eagles.

‘‘It was a fun match to wrestle,” said Pitt
Coach Rande Stottlemyer. “It was nip and
tuck the whole way. It was very intense
and a wild match the whole way through.”

Grabbing victories for Pitt against Clarion
were Sean Moffitt (126 pounds), Doug
Johnson (150), Scott Hovan (158), Sean
Gibbs (167) and Perry Miller (heavyweight).

Gibbs, who injured a knee while

“I give him a lot of credit,” said
Stottlemyer. “He hurt his hand during the

Bulls’ offense shut down by Blazing hot goalie, 11-7

In the Year of the Goal in the
Major Indoor Lacrosse League,
fans were treated to a low—scorin g
barn burner Saturday night as the
New England Blazers knocked
off the Pittsburgh Bulls 11-7
behind goalie Dan O’Neil’s 36

The score was actually closer
than it appears; the Blazers tallied
two open-net goals in the waning
minutes, one just outside diving
Bulls’ goalie Kevin Bi1ger’s stick.

Bulls second-leading scorer
Butch Marino said before the
game that the Bulls wanted to get
off to a fast start against the
quicker Blazer team. Instead it
was New England that jumped

point on the Bulls outplayed the
Blazers, but they couldn’t get
over the hump. The closest they
came was 6-5 early in the third
quarter.

“We’ve had 6-2 leads in all
threegames we lost. Tonight as a
team we stayed into it for 60
minutes and didn’t let them get
the crowd into it,” said game
MVP O’Neil. F

Bulls’ Coach Dennis Wey,
General Manager Haswell
FranklinJr., and Marino all agreed
that loose balls and second shots
were the key to the Blazers’
victory.

“They beat us to ground balls,
which gave them three and four
opportunities in our end of the
floor, as opposed to our guys
getting one, maybe two, shots on
offense,” Wey said. “But give
[O’Neil] credit, he played a hell of
a game.” ' Q;

The outstanding play of O’Neil
and the solid defensive play of
both teams made it the lowest-
scoring game of the 1991 MILL
season. Scoring for the league
has skyrocketed from 21 goals a
game last year to almost 30 per
game this year. The combined
total of 18'and the Bulls’ seven
were both the lowest figures of
the season. ’

Each team had several streaks
in the game; each Bulls’ streak
got them within two goals and
brought the crowd into it. Each

time the Blazers answered with a 

streak of their own.

After the Blazers’ first four goals,
the Bulls’ John Wilson scored
one of his two goals, and rookie
Ed Stephenson scored just before
the end of the first quarter to
make it 4-2 Blazers.

The Bulls finished out the first-
half scoring with a pair of power-
play goals, the first byjohn Wilson
and the second by Butch Marino,
giving him a team-leading 13,
goals on the year.

The Bulls’ Bill Wyker struck
first in the second half on a nice
pass from Marino to pull to within
one, 6-5. The 8,550 fans in the
Civic Arena exploded but were
quickly quieted by a Blazer goal
a minute later. New England
extended their lead to 9-5 in the
fourth and didn’t allow another
goal until Wilson scored his 13th
goal of the season late in the final
quarter.

The Bulls‘ Jeff Klodzen came 

out of a scramble for the loose
ball and put it in the net to pull to
within two.

The Bulls then pulled their
goalie with 2 minutes and 43
seconds left but couldn’t convert.

The Bulls were without the
services of defensive star Dave
Pietramala, out with a broken
hand, and last season’s MILL goal-
scoring champ Brian Nikula, who
sat outbecause of a pulled muscle.

Tim Conway and rookie Brook
Chase, who had an assist in his
first game, replaced the two.

“It’s one thing to replace your
N0- 12 and 13 guys, but it’s tough
to replace two of your top 4
players,” Franklin said.

“When you’re 2-3, your first
goal is to win the next one to get
back to .500, and then take them
one at a time," said Wey.

T aylor’s school record helps women gymnasts win

The crowd at Trees Hall fell silent
moments before the score for Tina T aylor’s
floor performance was posted. When
Taylor's score of 9.8, a new school record,
appeared on the turn board, both the
crowd and the Lady Panthers cheered
wildly. -

With T aylor’s score, the Lady Panther
were able to defeat the Lady Cardinals of
Ball State University 184.60 to 179.85.

From the beginning of the meet the
Lady Panthers outclassed Ball State. After
the first round, which had Pitt vaulting
event and Ball State on the uneven parallel
bars, the Lady Panthers led by 3.75 points.

of 46.45, while BSU’s bar squad scored a

“Perry wrestled great again,”

Stottlemyer said it's been a
tough season to swallow, but he
said he feels the dual matches are
just a warmup for what’s ahead in see, ”
the future.

“It’s not hard getting the guys
motivated, even though I think
that they are disappointed,” said
Stottlemyer. “We want to get the

vaults extremely well, with several of the
performers doing two different vaults
during their pass.

“Three of our kids did two different v
vaults,” said Coach Debbie Yohman, “They
would ‘do the first one and get a good
score on it, and then they would try a
harder second vault. When you have good
scores, you can afford to do that.”

Strong vaulting performances were
turned in by Carrie Carnesale (9.35), Gina
Venezia (9.30), Tina Taylor (9.30), Kathy
Wallish (9.30), Jeannie Vecchio (9.25) and
Kristin Brown (9.10).

During the second round of the meet
the BSU squad managed to narrow down
the Lady Panthers’ lead to 2.95 points, but
the Pitt gymnasts were not going to let the
Lady Cardinals get the best of them.

The Lady Panthers’ bar squad scored a
45.95, while the BSU vaulting squad scored

a 46.75.

Last season, Pitt’s bar squad was not as
powerful as it has been this season, and
the team has since turned itself around.

Strong performances for Pitt came from

Jorgensen (9.10), Wallish (9.05), Taylor
(9.05) and Carnesale (9.00).

The Lady Panthers have always been a
very,aggressive balance— beam team, but
this past weekend the Pitt beam squad
seemed a bit shaky during its performances.
The Lady Panthers were led on the beam
who went 7.70. According to both Vecchio
and Yohman, the beam is a totally different
event from any of the other events in
gymnastics.

“It’s a whole different mood,” said
Vecchio. “Where on bars you have to get

Emotion

Continued from page 7

But Saturday night was
different.

Pitt Coach Paul Evans made a
pregame visit to the student
section and requested noise —
lots of it — from the stunned
early arrivals. He got it.

Soon even the n.ormally
restrained season-ticket holders
were standing for the opening
tip.

Meanwhile, Curtis Aiken, a
Panther point guard from 1984 to
1987, provided the team with a
pregame motivational speech.

“He came in and told us that
we shouldn’t be playing for the
NBA or for individual recognition;
we should play for the good of
the team,” said Miller. “And
because it was Curtis, it hit through
to us. He was a player here, and
now he's a successful busi-
nessman. If it was someone else
that came in, we would have just
been like ‘Oh, sure. Whatever.’

“Sometimes people lose sight

of the fact that it’s the people

who turnwit on and win, especially
at the end of the year, that get
recognition,” said Miller. “It’s
people like Rumeal Robinson at
Michigan and Tate George
[Connecticut] who make the team

win that get recognition. Winning
is everything.”

Their new passion for success
was evident early as the Panthers
grabbed a 7-0 lead, and the
defense shut out St. John’s until
the 5-minute, 4-4—second mark.

“I don’t know if we were ever
in the game,” said Carnesecca.

“As long as we keep talking to
each other, and helping each
other we should do fine,” said
Pitt’s Antoine Jones, who added
that communication had been
missing on the team during the
past couple of weeks.

“We weren’t talking to each
other. The emotion wasn’t there,
but it was there [Saturday] night,”
saidjones. “Some guys have been
down on themselves. We needed
someone to get us going, to give
us courage and let us know that
we can be tough to beat.”

And with road games at
Georgetown and Syracuse this
week, Aiken’s speech cou1dn’t“?
have come at as better time. H
. ‘.‘We?ve gotto keepa positive-
attitude’ down theystretch. We’ve
got a long wayto go,” said Shorter.

PI'IT BITS: The Panthers have
never won at Georgetown since
joining the Big East Conference
in the 1982-83 season.

Miller

Continued from page 7
worryin g a littleless about ﬁnding
an open man inside and instead
has been launching the ball
towards the bucket. Shooting has
been the name of the game for
the Pantherlpoint guard lately.

“Whether I go one for eight or
eight for eight, [Evans] saidl have
to become more offensive-
minded. I think I’ve done that
and it’s made a big difference,”
Miller said. J

Indeed, it has. Miller recently
went six for six from three—point
land and had a season—high 22
points in the Feb. 12 loss at Seton
Hall. In games where Miller has
scored‘ in double figures this
season and in turn has taken his
share of shots, Pitt has gone 10-5.

Miller admitted to a recent four-

game stretch where he lost
conﬁdence in his shooting and
offensive abilities. Ironically, it

started with the St. John’s game in . 1

New York, where he scored only
four points and_ended at UCLA,
where he knocked down 15.
During the stretch, Miller scored
a total of only 16 points.

“I lost my confidence in my
shot, and every time down the
court I was thinking, ‘Man, I
haven’t madeone. That's four in
a row I missed.’ And that affects
everything —— your aggressiveness
on offense, your passing, -
everything,” Miller said.

“But when my shot is on, it

affects me in a positive way. And
when I take seven or eight shots,
it keeps me in the flow of the

A game.”

Soviet

Continued from page 3
Another argument against

granting Lithuania independence
is “that it may cause a split of the
Soviet Union, and it is worth
keeping the country intact,”
Khaimovich said.

If Lithuania is granted
independence, some think that
other republics would follow,
Khaimovich said. M a n y
people want to keep the Soviet
Union intact because they think it
is easier to deal with one large
country than nine smaller ones,
according to Khaimovich.
