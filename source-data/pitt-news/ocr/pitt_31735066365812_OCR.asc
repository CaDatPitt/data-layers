PIRG seeks Trustee, faculty endorsements

"Following. the suggestion of

Chancellor Wesley Posvar. PIRG

representatives will plead their
case at an emergency meeting of
the Student Affairs Committee of
the Board of Trustees in a further
effort to win University approval
of their proposal.

- , They will also seek to persuade

Trustees -Rep. K. Leroy Irvis.
Judge Ruggiero Aldisert. and Wil-
liam Rea to put their proposal on
the agenda of /the Board of Trus-
tees meeting—Tuesday.

Hoping to extend their power
base, the PIRG proponents also
met with a special Senate Coun-
cil subcommittee yesterday in a
preliminary effort to obtain back-
ing from that group.

Their strategies evolved in a
general meeting of PIRG enthusi-
asts after the group's leaders met
unsatisfactorily with administra-
tors Wednesday.

had hoped to persuade Posvarei-.

commodate the PIRG proposal
and suggested the emergency
meeting of the Student Affair
Committee. V

He also sought to. persuade
PIRG to be funded through the
Student Government allocations
process, offering to modify the
process to fit the proposal. A

“It was just a big runaround to-

day at a very high, emotional _

pitch,” Varrenti told the 40
PIRG supporters gathered. at the
Wednesday meeting. “He (Pos-
var) definitely lost his cool.”

The Chancellor, however. con-
tended-that PIRG’s insistence on
the use of its funding proposal is
the stumbling block in having
PIRG instituted at Pitt.

"One of the main difficulties is
their fixation upon a single col-

lection device," Posvar said. "In- ,
stead of arguing . . . let’s try to

solve the problem in a positive,
way."

-“We have a new Student Gov-

, ernment and an allocations pro-

cess,” he continued. “We ought

to make a sincere effort to.see-

PIRG funded through that ve-
hicle." . . .

The Chancellor suggested rais-
ing the activities fee from $12 to
$14 and allocating the $2 raise to
PIRG.

If the presentallocations pro-
cess proved ill-suited to such a
solution, Posvar sa_id the adminis-

made viable. 4’ ' ’

"Posvar told Pittinger (Penn-

Brainwashing’ irks . ,

The content of "'1972f A Sexual Odyssey," sponsored by Wome‘n's,'y;_,fj_",’ij
Housing Board and Environmental Action Zero Population Growth,”  _.
has come under fire by the Women Concerned for the Unborn Child.  . 

An unofficial bulletin posted throughout the University charged_ 

the sponsors of “A Sexual Odyssey” with presentation of a biased

program. The statement accused the organizers of the program with“, 
"using the»Odyssey ‘only to further their own limited goals——,not those   

of the students attending.”

Although Mary Winter. president of Women'Concerned for the Un-)

born Child-, was not sure if the notice had been ‘posted by her group, she - -l 7 
said that she had called the organizers of the symposium requesting a i 5’

This request, she said, was “flatly denied.”

Katz also said that the decision to exclude the group was based   _l

“They-were proposing no alternatives, just showingtheir disagree-if

Winter disagreed, calling the question of abortions the
most controversial issue in’ the country.“ '

"With the lack in balance," she said. "this program could‘well.- 
come under the heading of ‘brainwashing.’ It becomes a matter of civil ,0
rights when a publip university. funded by taxes, denies students a bal-

ance of information."

Marc Hiller, coordinator of Environmental Action/Zero Popula- ,

tion Growth (EA/ZPG), said that the decision of the panel was based‘
on past experience. Last year, he said, the Women Concerned for the.

Unborn Child were present at a program similar to this years.
"That program turned into a ‘political game,” he said,

Hiller cited the monetary status of the Women Concerned for the ‘ 

Unborn’ Child as another factor. He described the group-as being fully

capable of sponsoring their own seminar. A newsletter, he said, reveal- . A’.’-ll’:

Baird defends abortions

by Lois LEVINSON

In spite of threats on his life and
assorted arrests on various
charges, William‘ Baird, director
and founder of the New York Par-
ent Aid Society, manages to retain

 his sense. of humor and keep on

pushing for women’s rights to
maintain sovereignty over their

 bodies.

Speaking on “The ABC's of Abor-

n tion and ”Birth Control” as part of

Wednesday’s “Sexual Odyssey,”
Baird urged students toget in-
volved.

"-Don’t stand so far behind me
that I can’t see you,” he said.
“Don’t believe that because abor-
tions are now legal in New York
that we aren’t in grave danger of

 _ having the law repealed. There

is a lot you can do right here to
change things in Pennsylvania.”

He proposed an abortion com-

""mittee»that would invite wives of

legislators to hear it and a move
to keep the legislature from re-
pealing Medicaid to women desir-
ing legal abortions as possible
measures to combat anti-abor-
tionists. I
Displaying boards with actual
apparatus attached to them,
Baird showed such instruments
as pencils, coat hangers, basters,

and plastic tubing from fish tanks‘
that women have used to try and

abort themselves, many of whom

I . died from the results.

He also displayed a board with
an array of birth control methods
which he explained to his audi-

ence with an added word of cau- '’

tion.

“Even the pill, the safest meth-
od when used correctly, is not en-

" L tirely safe. Then some women are

 

forced to use abortion as a means
of birth control."

Baird accused the Roman Cath-
olic Church of “unmitigated gall“
in staging a smear-type propagan-
da war against him.

“They’ve called meeverything
from a Hitler to the William Cal-
ley of the Abortion War; ‘called
me ababy killer, told me I should
be carved into pieces—and. of
course all in the name of God._

  
   

BAID
Women's Rights Advocate

“With over 12,000 babies born
to girls under 14 in this country
and at least 1,000 addicted babies
born who die agonizing deaths and
end up in garbage cans in New
York City alone, and all of this
suffering perpetrated because
women are refused help in term-
inating unwanted pregnancies,
who would you say has the least
regard for life?”

The church’s stance on the is-
sue, according to Baird, stems
from its desire to cement its erod-
ing power.

"It’s ironic,” he said, "that the
church sanctioned abortions from

1249 to 1869 when Pope Pius IX
decided that "life begins at con-
ception. -

Baird added that 62 per cent of
the clients at his clinics have
been Roman Catholic. Three cli-
entstheclaimedﬁwere nuns.

There is a law that says that a
group may not remain tax exempt
if it lobbies for a political issue.
Why then should the church retain
its tax exemption if it continues to
put thousands of dollars into their
campaign and send tax-free pro-
paganda through the mail.‘

In New Jersey Baird was ar-
rested for corrupting the morals
of a minor when he displayed a
diaphragm in front of a 14-month
old baby along with the baby’s
mother.

Wisconsin authoritiesissued a
warrant for his arrest for exhibit-
ing the same objects he showed
his Pitt audience on charges of
"indecent exposure of an obscene
object."

In two weeks Baird will once
again go on trial.

“This time I was arrested for
showing a diaphragm and passing
out a sample of foam. The Massa-
chusetts Attorney General filed
suit under the state's right ‘to
protect the purity and the chastity
of American women.’

“The case will appear before
the Supreme Court. If I win. it
may mean the legalization of
abortions in this country. If I lose.
it means I will be put in jail for
committing a felony.

“I have been fighting to give
women the right to make their
own decisions. Now I need your
support.“

Panelists recommend

abortion law reforms

by GLENDA MINSHULL

The surprise appearance of Bill Baird. key figure in the abortion
reform movement. countered’ an anti-abortion onslaught waged by
members of the audience _.during a panel discussion of the legal and leg-
islative aspects of abortion in Pennsylvania.

The discussion was part of a day-long symposium. "Sexual Odys-
sey." sponsored by the Women's Housing Board and the Environmen-
tal Action Group.

Baird"s rebuttal centered upon the right of women “to control
their own uterus." '

He was particularly critical of interest groups, such as the Cath-
olic Church, which lobby against abortion reform through the use of
non-taxable funds. (Federal law prohibits the use of such funds for lob-
bying purposes.)

"It's time that~we got the church and legislature out of the bed-
room." he said. "When did the uterus become the property of the
state?" 0

Jay Wells, state representative, explained legislative efforts to-
wards abortion reform, ranging from total prohibition regardless of
the circumstances to a more liberal bill which would make abortion a
medical matter between the woman and her physician.

The technical aspects ofﬂabortion procedures were presented by
Dr. Thomas Allen. department of obstetrics and gynecology. McGee
Women‘s Hospital. who views abortion as a medical procedure.

“It’s no different than a tonsillectomy,” Allencountered in re-
sponse to charges from the audience that abortion is sanctioned mur-
der. .
Pat Miller. president of the Pennsylvania Abortion Justice Asso-
ciation and a member of Shapp‘_s abortion commission. discussed the
discrepancies of present abortion laws.

"Nobody knows what it means—the law simply forbids ‘unlawful
abortion.” she said. "and the legislators forgot to define the term un-
lawful?" v

VMiller further criticized the law’s outdated origin, “It was passed
in 1860, 60 years before people with uteruses were given the right to
determine their own destiny.”

She favors a state-wide referendum as the most effective means
of changingabortion laws. since public opinion polls have shown/that a
majority (75 per cent) of Pennsylvanians view abortions as a personal
matter to be determined by the individual. ’

John Flannigan, president of the Pittsburgh American Civil Lib-

erties Union (ACLU), disagreed with Miller, arguing that successful

abortion reform can take place within the court system. ‘

Panel labels honesty . Avoids $310010“

free sex prerequisite

by ANNE CUNNINGHAM

Despite its provocative topic.
Wednesday morning's "Human
Sexuality” discussion lured few
students.

The panel for the sparsely at-
tended opening program of the
"Sexual Odyssey" forum includ-
ed Maurice Cerul. M.D.. of the
Western Psychiat-ricilnstitute and
Clinic; Chilton Knudsen of Chat-

'ham’s Biology Department: Pa-

tricia"Skiba. a student in Pitt‘s
Graduate School of Public Health.

and Joseph Werlinich of Pitt‘s

Graduate School of Education.

All agreed that sexual inter-
course is an important facet of
male—female relations but that a
successful relationship requires a
strong person-to-person commit-
ment.

The “new freedom,” said Skiba,-

implies a new awareness of the
emotions involved in sexual ac-
tivity. Love, she said, need not
be involved; sex is a matter of
“honest relations without guilt.”

“Do what is comfortable" is
Knudsen‘s advice to her sex edu-
cation classes at Chatham. She
said that her students‘ biggest
hang-up is fear of not measuring
up to a partners previous sex
mates. This should not be a ma-
jor concern. she said. if the per-
formance is "infused with the
spirit of giving and uniting."

As a counselor. Werlinich said
he has discovered that many
young people are not freely en-
gaging in sexual intercourse.
Most students he has encounter-
ed. he said. desire a "really inti-
mate. caring experience of.some-
one over a period of time. where
sex is not the only unity."

Cerul proposed a broad sex ed-
ucation program to alleviate sex-
ual problems. This, he said,
should begin in grade school,
geared to that level, and continue
through high school seminars and
college sexuality courses.

“There is a need for greater
understanding of the natural bodi-
ly changes during our constant
aging process." he said.

The effort. he said. must be co-

operative among "family, school.
and church." “

SG okays Hayes rescheduling

Aiming to avoid a possible loss
of $3,100, Student Government
approved General Studies Cabi-
net Chairman Gordon Percy’s
proposal for rescheduling the
Isaac Hayes concert.

Although the final decisioniis
up to the Cabinet, Percy request-
ed input from the Board since
SG would assume the loss.

Conﬂict-Peace debut
discussed by FASC

by SHARON SEXTON

The recently approved Conflict
and Peace certificate program
met with very little opposition
from faculty representatives at
the recent meeting of the Faculty
of Arts and Sciences Council.

Several faculty members
charged that the program, which
professes to be interdisciplinary.
concentrates too heavily on the
Social Sciences. A literature
course exploring the theme of
war and peace as expressed in
such writers as Tolstoy, Sartre.
and Camus was suggested toen-
hance the interdisciplinary na-
ture of the program.

D12, Jerome Laulicht, director
of the program, explained that
such a course could not be imple-
mented for the fall term. There is.
however. a provision in the pro-
gram providing for an evaluation

at the end of two terms. A course

could be included at that time.

Until then, he said, interested
students could explore this alter-
native in independent study.

Council members agreed that
an overlap between Political Sci-
ence 50 and “War and Peace" was
not detrimental. The over1ap,they
said, would relieve some of the
burden from the Political Science
Department. '

Laulicht said that the next‘ two
weeks will be spent recruiting

-volunteers to teach the fall

Laulicht sees- the problem of
“letting people know what’s hap-
pening” as the biggest obstacle to
the success of the program.

He -and several assistants are
working on a brochure and
lengthy. course descriptions which
they hope will catch the attention
and interest of students.

Though several of the Board
members expressed concern that
the majority of dorm students
would be gone by that date, Percy

argued that, since “a large por-

tion of the student body are com-
muters and Oakland residents,”
and “a large portion of the dorm

"With a 1000 watts,” she said,
we could serve the commuters as
well as the campus.”

Peter Longini, the station's fac-
ulty advisor, said that the plans
are only the first step in forming
the FM station.

“There is still much work to be

‘done, such as structuring, financ-

ing, licensing, and staffing,” he
commented.

Stillanother problem facing the
station is the placement of the FM
transmitter.

"We want to make sure the Ca-
thedral doesn’t block out our sig-
nal," said Jennings.

However, /placement of the

transmitter atop the Cathedral
may pose problems.

Unless we get" the support of the

office groups in the Cathedral and
the students, I don’t think we're

going to be able to do it," said i 
Longini. "We‘ll need outside in-

Once these difficulties are re:

display courage

The leaders of Pitt's PIRG chapter are to be commended for dis-

.:.playing what has been referred to as courage. or grace under pressure
Though PIRG’s backers have suffered severe setbacks in conver-
Tfsations with the administration. they continue to try to communicate
. through reason. by exhausting all available means short of confronta-
.jAAtion politics. _ ' A '

l_ ‘Yesterday, PIRG'supporters met with faculty members in an ef-
fort to mobilize the faculty and perhaps bring their grievances to the
.- attention of the Senate Council. which meets Monday. A

,  PIRG advocatesare also attempting to convince members of the
A-‘Executive Committee of the Board of Trustees'that PIRG should be
 placed on the agenda for the Board’s next meeting, which is Tuesday.

 In addition, PIRG enthusiasts will be sitting down with members

of-the Board’s Student Affairs ‘ Committee in the near future—a sug-

gestion that was made Wednesday by Chancellor Posvar.

 The devotion of PIRG’s leaders has been both iinflagging and in-

spiking. ' - - .

i  Where others might have been tempted to throw up their hands in

despair, PIRG’s backers have refused to give up. A I A
' Their/commitmentiis understandable, because 9.000 Pitt students

’-ilposed. and approximately 500 of these students have gotten involved
5 with PIRG on an organizational level. -

_ ‘A; -Such solidarity on the part of the student body has not been inevi-

to witness this regenera tion of student concern-. .

Libfertlil pressure mounts

Muskie’s Victory pyrrhic

by DENNIS KLEPPICK

Muskie. 48: McGovern. 36. In the basketball
game of New Hampshire politics. Muskie’s percen-
tage of the vote in the nations first primary would
indicate that he is the winner. ‘

' Indeed. in a post-election interview. Muskie
continually alluded to the fact that he has been the
winner in three successive contests. the caucuses
of Arizona and Iowa and the primary of New Hamp-
shire. ‘

It wasn't a complete victory. however. The re-
sults indicate .-a rehash of the 1968 party disun'ity
which-cost the Democrats the Presidency.

It should be noted that 36 per cent of the vote I

went to McGovern, a candidate considered far more
liberal and dovish than Muskie.
McGovern. who rose from a pre.-election opin-
ion pollAA low of 10 per cent to the percentage of 36
per-cent.proclaimedavictory. . A v
Muskie. in‘ turn. fell from 60 per cent to 48 per
cent. below the acceptable minimum of 50 per cent
set by Muskie himself. ‘ , I ’
‘ Note also_that. liberal Lindsay and McGovern
garnered ll‘of Arizona’s delegates to Muskie’s nine.

This is an’ indication of the strength of the ultra’-
liberal_ faction of the Democratic party.

Any politician knows he cannot win with al

splintered party. He need only remember the 1968
election when a combination of mass defection on
the war issue and disillusionment on part of-Mc-
Carthyites and Kennedyites c'ontrib’u.ted‘ to Hump-
hrey's defeat. '

Therefore, assuming Muskie wins the nomina-

tion, the pressure will be on ‘him to make conces-

sions to liberal strength in" order ‘to retain party

unity. - -
These concessions would probably appear in

the party platform and, possibly. the selection "of a

AVice-Presidential candidate.

Muskie’s current Vulnerability can be attri-
buted mainly to two factors. I ‘

‘ Overconfidence. Muskie’ -spent "less time! and '

organizational effort than his chief opponent, Mc-
Govern. People like to think that someone up there
is paying attention. A . A

' McGovern had an organization that personally

visited each registered_Democrat at least once with

Personality. While both candidates are essen-
tially dry. uninspiring individuals, Muskie lost his
temper in a bitter attack on Manchester Union
Leader publisher William Leob.

If it was absolutely necessary to attack at all.
it would have been better handled by an aide.

People tend to have a certain god-like image of A

a president and assume that he is above petty argu-
ments and mud-slinging.
Muskie displayed the famous temper alluded to

by the news media andcaused people to wonder

about his control.

The contrast was heightened by Nixon’s cool
handling"of the China visit while Muskie shed tears
for the national television audience.

- The issuesin New Hampshire seemed, muted.
Musk-ie has yet to come out with a firm plan on the
economygbusing. and the war. While tly presents

other candidateswith a low-profile target. it does ’

not. conversely. present voters with a clear idea of
Muskiels beliefs.
McGovern has assumed certain stands for a

number of years. While this hasearned him more -

.....nntm

 

enemies than friends. it has also earned hima cer- '_ _

tain amount of respect as a man who projects con-
sistency based on conscience-

Overall, however, Muskie has been able to pro-
ject an aura of competency by embracing popular
issues and conveniently. sidestepping explosive
ones. If he can continue this, he should be able’ to
navigate the rocky political road to the convention.

At present the conflict has been between Mus-

kie and the ultra-liberals. New Hampshire has not A

tested the candidacy of Hubert H. Humphrey who.
purportedly. is still lab.or’s golden boy. Nor has New
Hampshire shed sufficient light on the‘ touchy sub-
jects of busing and economy. '

With over 20 primaries to go._.. the first of which
is Florida on March 14. the issues and trends will
ebb and flow in the national eye. The strength of the
candidates will solidify.

As it is; Muskie will undoubtedly learn his les-
sons. He is still‘ the man to beat and the New Hamp- ’
shire setback will only make him try harder to stay
number one. . - .

Hopeful Walgren preaches new

by ROB OBENREDER
Before a small group of political
enthusiasts, Doug Walgren, can-
didate for Congress. discussed
his views and future plans dur-

ing a one-hour session Wednesday '

in 524 Student Union.

If elected in the April 25th
elections. Walgren will im-
mediately fill the office of con-
gressman for the 27th District
left vacant by the death of Jim
Fulton.

He will also be running in
the fall election against incum-
bent John Heinz for congressman
of the 18th District, to be form-
ed when the new reapportion-
ment measures take effect.

Walgren began the session by
talking about his experiences
in the 1970 election, in which he
made a good showing, but was
defeated’ by incumbent Fulton.
He mentioned the violence that
was prevalent during the past
elections. citing the trouble that
erupted when Vice President Ag-
new visited Pittsburgh two years
ago. “Violence triggers violence,’
Walgren, stated, saying both po-
lice and civilians should be aware
of that fact.

He mentioned his loss to Ful-

ton. commenting. “Elections are
not based on the merits of the
times." Therefore, he said. in-
cumbents are usually re-elected
without much consideration of
their opponents.

Walgren also said that many
politicians are more concerned
with political security than with

' serving their constituents. They
often spend a great amount of
time acquiring influential friends

. and creating a power structure.
he declared, neglecting
duties as elected officials. But he
showed optimism in stating.

their .

"Politicians are coming out of'

that kind of politics. Whatever
politicians are telling you. they
ought to tell it to you straight.“

Walgren also talked about his
plans for the upcoming elec-
tion, stating, “We have a win-
ning situation,” and asked for stu-

dent support and participation

in the campaign.

In speaking of his fall con-
test with Heinz, Walgren stated
it would be a “tough election.
because my opponent has a lot
of money ' but cash isn‘t
everything.” Walgren said his
use of publicity and the frank-
ing privilege, if elected in April.
would be a great help in the

fall elections.

The session was -then opened
for questions. The first ‘issue to
be brought up was that of bus-
ing. Walgren stated he was op-
posed to a Constitutional Amend-
ment.concerning busing because
it would ‘inhibit future inter-

pretation of the constitution in
this area. Stating "this is going
to be a neighborhood country.‘-‘
he stressed the improvement of
the schools themselves; that
busing was “not the answer. . .

lesbian activists from New York
and co.-authors of the book Sappho
was a Right-on Woman.

An informal discussion on how
to_ increase the social level of
people's understanding of the
concepts of homosexuality will
follow-.

MEET THE ORDER THAT
IS 113 YEARS YOUNG.

Paulists are often called the
“modern" order but it isn’t just

- because we are only a little over
a century old. It’s "because of
what we stand for. . i

The Paulists were founded by
Isaac Hecker, one of the earliest
ecumenical spokesmen. Father
Hecker, who was a convert to
Catholicism and a century ahead
of his time, conceived and di-
rected the ﬁrst missionary soci-
ety of priests established in, and
for, North America.

‘ Father Hecker’s vision was a
community that would “meet the
needs of the Church in each age

'_8S they arise.” For this reason
he wanted the Paulists to be ﬂex-
ible, not wedded to speciﬁc
works. A special project might
be suitable for" a particular time
and a given need, but changing
times would require different
techniques and approaches that
might differ from age to age.

That’s why the Paulists are so
ﬂexible. Whether a man is in a
parish, University Apostolate or
mission. . .whether he is involved
in a narcotic panel or the Paulist
press, radio, ﬁlms or television,
he has the freedom to use his
own talents in his own way to
achieve his objectives.

Paulists are not custodians of
the past, but explorers of the
future.

Now you know why we are
called “modern.”

the Paulist priesthood write to:

taxes. . ._there must be equal fi-
nancing for all public schools."

However, he thought the citi-.
zens‘ ability to improve schools
must not be prohibited. When
asked his views on aid to Catho-
lic schools. Walgren said, "Catho-
lic schools must be preserved
. . . because they are educating
so many students."

Unemployment was the next
topic of discussion. “When you
see the damage of unemploy-g
ment, you can’t help feel the
government should be respon-
sible for finding employment.”
Walgren stated, citing his ex- \
perience as a legal services at-
torney. -

The Republicans have. Wal-
grem charged, attempted to use
unemployment as a means of
stemming inflation: institutions
such as banks, he contended
benefited from high unemploy-
ment. Walgren claimed the pre-
sent administration had not rec-
ognized the sources of inflation.
saying he thought it was directly
linked to the Viet Nam war.

from state to state, but “an auto

Walgren was asked if he was

mary. “My support wouldn’

C—MU now uses a system where
students receive either "Honors“
for excellent work."‘credit" for
satisfactory work or ‘jno entry”
for unsatisfactory work.

The committee said many
students objected to the system
on grounds it would hurt their
chances of admission to gradu-
ate school.

The committee queried sev-
eral graduate schools and found
that 52 felt the system would de-
finitely hurt applicants from
C-MU: 10 said it was question-
able, and two said the system
was not harmful. .

"As competition for limited’
places increases. it will become
even more difficult to gain ad-
mission without excellent letter
grades and good recommenda-
tions." wrote a spokesman for
the graduate division of the Uni-
versity of California at Berkeley.

An official of the University
of Wisconsin pointed out that
the system makes it impossible
for graduate schools to disting-
uish between, for example. a B

student and low C student be-"

cause both would have only
“credit" on their grade trans-
cripts.

ing to Green. the party had 14..-

Bike registration zooms

4 Hardy cyclists brave elements

by NORA WYSE

Like the bus and auto com-
muter. those who cycle to and
from campus each da_v endure
many problems.

The most critical is the wea-
ther. Hardier enthusiasts brave
the elements and ride all win-
ter. ‘

“You get used to the cold and
you’re careful on ice,” said one
senior cyclist. “The only problem
I had this winter was getting

snowed-in on campus once in
December.”

Rain hinders only those riders
who mind getting wet or who
own lightweight bikes.

"I don‘t find a large bike dif-

‘:ficult to handle in the rain."

said English instructor and writer
Lee Gutkind. “Rain. doesn’t in-
hibit my progress. but I think it‘s
foolish to try to control a small
bike on the slick streets."

Unlike the auto commuter
whose chief complaints are lack
of parking and high cost of me-
ters. the cyclist finds special.
free parking areas provided at
Pitt at the Student Union. Lang-
ley Hall. and David Lawrence
Hall.

On warm days, though, all
these lots may be filled to capa-

of cycling’s popularity.

have not dampened cycling en-

And the mandatory wearing
of helmets is no longer a major
gripe. A rider is today typified
by the helmet he sports..Part
of the “total look." a helmet
often reflects a riders person-
ality.- ,

One student decorated a hel-

The road test still presents a

problem because it frightens
many new riders. It consists
of several basic maneuvers;
figure-eight turns, a double run
through a serpentine course,
and making an emergency
stop.

To avoid taking the test. one
student continuously renewed
his learners permit. A state pa-
trolman at the testing area. how-

IHiI|sicIe singers capture wor|d’s ‘true emotions’

by DEAN SIEGAL.

.- to Sing.“ has become an international hit on television. have followed
' their initial success with the recording of "Were Together." a song
‘ based on the McDonald’s hamburger commercial theme.

McDonald’s hamburger outlets
are promoting the new release;

The song speaks of the lack of unity in the United States today
and urges people to stop knocking the country and to begin building
it up—together.

McDonald’s eivi dentilywishes to be associated with this All-Ameri-
can theme of good will, thus, their active support for the Hillside
Singers. I —

The group is-composed of nine talented people. all under the
direction of Al Ham. the energetic. enthusiastic and even more tal-
ented producer of the group. Ham feels that the new song "captures
the true emotions of the real world."

"That seems to be what the people today are looking for" he
says. The success of the Coca-Cola commercial proves his theory.

The Hillsode ‘Singers made a one day stopover in Pittsburgh
this week as part of a cross country tour to plug their first album
also entitled I’d Like To Teach The World To Sing.

The album accomplishes its purpose——to sing "music for the
people." Songs on the album include those made famous by other
artists. "Take Me Home, Country Roads.” "Amen," “Old Fasioned
Love Sont,” "Kum Ba Yah," and "The‘Night They Drove Old Dixie
Down,” are five of the more popular songs on the album. I

The choice of songs for their first record shows where the Hill-
side Singers want to be, The quality of the songs varies, however.’
Each melody tends to sound like the other with little variety in
dynamics. Similar instruments are used in every song, which makes
for a pleasant melody but a monotonous album.

We’re Together contains sincere and true words. A melody like

)

far. the reaction to their new song has been enthusiastic. a sign
that the talents of the Hillside Singers may very likely succeed.

The Hillside Singers. whose recording ‘'I‘d Like to Teach the World \

throughout’ the United States.

the McDonald’s~theme song tends to ruin a fine group of lyrics. _Thus.

Even though the instrument is
this does not necessarily
mean that it is without value.
Acoustics in the rotunda are
quite resonant and the console
can be positioned so that the

audience is able to see the per-'

former. The sound of the instru-
ment lacks brilliance, however,
especially in the reed division.

While the organist can hardly
be blamed for the instrument
with which he must work, his
selections on the program were

quite another matter. A terribly ‘

bland work of Roussel opened‘

the program. failing to inspire
any artistic enthusiasm among
the audience. The work perform-

ed was the only organ piece that‘!

Roussel ever composed and that’

probably had much to do with
our reactions.

After hearing _Lord‘s latest
Bach interpretation. I am con-
vinced that ‘he is not a Bach in-
terpreter. As he performed the
"Allegro" from the First Trio

"Sonata, mistakes stood out with

a very frank clarity.

His technique is more than ade-
quate but there is some obstacle
which does not allow him to
give his Bach interpretations the
smooth rendition they should
have.

Fortunately, the best was sav-

ed for last—it was in the final‘,-

work that Lord proved where his
strength really lies. The "Scher-
zo“ and "Finale" movements of
the First Organ Symphony of
Louis Vierne were performed
with an inspiring vitality that
awakened us from our program-
matic reverie. A

Vierne's work requires virtu-

osity, not only with the hands

_, but with disciplined pedalwork

as well. The notes were clean
and the final cadence with its
descending scale in the‘ pedals
was exciting to hear and to see.

While a program demands va-
riety I rather doubt that any of
us would complain if Lord would
devote an entire recital to the
works of the modern French
school. He is “at home” with this
music more than with any other
and his long identification with
it lends to the authenticity of his
interpretations.

The next recital in this series
is scheduled for April 4 with the
great majority of the program
dedicated to French composers.

COLLEGE PARK. ‘.\ia.—wiiiie many top seeded
grapplers bit the dust here in College Park. Md. yester-
day. the Iowa State Cyclones managed to score 21 points
and take the lead in the 42nd NCAA wrestling tournament
going into today's quarter-final round.

All three Pitt matmen suffered defeats. John Chat-
man (158). Jim Fleming (167). and Craig '1‘;-itch (19()._
all lost on decisions in the first round. '

However. Chatman and Tritch may still beeligible to
bound back in the consolation rounds.'This situation de-

pends upon whether or not conquerors Rick Badman of

Michigan State (158) and Bruce Davis of New
I (190) advance into the semi—finals this evening.
‘_‘Bimbo” won his pre-preliminary match by mauling
Paulis Johnson of Appalacian State, 12-2, but then drop-
ped the'5-2-decision to Badman. Fleming lost to Mike Bea-

man of Drake by a score of 10-2, while Davis wiped

Tritch out 17-2.

Although the Panthers have scored only one and one-

half team points.‘ Eastern powers Penn State.and .\'av\'_
have tallied 11 andeight points. respectively. Oklahoma ,

State (16). Michigan State (15). Oklahoma i14i..and Port-

Mexico.

land State (13) are still in the running for the team title
and will challenge the rampaging C_yclones in today's de-
cisive rounds. . '

There were upsets galore in almost every weight
class. The most "startling bout «was at 126 pounds where
1971 champ Yosiro Fujita was forced to~defai_ilt in the
first period due to a shoulder separation which he incur-
red while attempting a single leg takedown.

_ Other surprises were ‘provided when Russ Johnson
of Washington State (third in 197} at 167) lost, 7-6, to Sam
Hieronymus»of Ohio’ U.; Bill,Demaray (North Dakota
State), a two-time small college titlist, lost to Yale’s Kev-
in Milliken, 5-4; and Washington’s Don Pleasant, seeded

third, dropped a 5-4 decision to Larry Johnson of North-
ern Illinois. ‘ .

Tom Teagarden of Penn State. who was seeded fifth
at 118.. was pinned by Indiana State's Dave Martin in the
second round dimming the Lions’ hopes at the team title.

Almost 9.200 - fans witnessed the 266 bouts held"
yesterday. Four thousand were on hand in the afternoon.
followed by 5.200 who attended the evening festivities. -

Springfield College (Mass) looms as the major
stumbling block in its path.

Pitt is represented by only three gymnasts——

Pribis will compete in the floor exercises and vault-

Matthews will see action in the still rings.

According to Assistant Coach Ig Perez. Dick
‘Pribis is Pitt's main hope for honors in the vaulting
competition. “Anything can happen in vaulting. It's

a one-shot affair, " Perez commented. '

In comparison to Pitt’s three man squad,
Penn State may have two or three gymnasts plac-

captain Tom Mitchell will lead the undefeated (8-0)

There are a large number of ‘athleteson this and

numerous other campuses that arrive sporting a.

full ride scholarship with elaborate press clippings
but for some reason never live up to expectations.
The reverse of this is also true. - 5

Leroy Freeman. a freshman basketball player.
came to Pitt with no scholarship and no press clip-
pings. But, he came here on a ‘special Black pro-
gram, with anauthentic love ofbasketball. and a
desire to obtain a college education via an athletic
scholarship. _‘ T . ’ 1

Leroy has been a valuable asset to Tim Grgu—
rich's frosh team. He has eclipsed the 20 point
mark four times. He and Kirk Bruce have done the

great majority of the rebounding and he finished

theseason‘ with ‘an approximate 15 point per game
average’. - ‘

If he is that good, one might ask, why isn’t he
on scholarship at some other school? i

_Well, according to his coach. Freeman was a.

victim of the City League. . -

"A lot of these guys could be playing on.schol- - A

arship somewhere else.” noted Grgurich. "but

there are so many schools that when a scoutis in -

the cityythey are overlooked. V “

_ Grgurich should be .very thankful that he didn’t
overlook Freeman once the freshman came out for
the team. Without him, it’s likely that Grgurich

' would not have had such a successful team. Every-

one expects scholarship players to do the job, but
hardly anyone anticipates a walk-on to contribute so
much. ' ‘

"Leroy has done everything we've asked of '

him." continued Grgurich. "He's not really an in-
side man. but he has'quick_ness. jumping ability and
a soft touch. He gets moody and down on himself on
occasiondand he needs help on his ball handling. He's

been touch offensivelyand I can't sayenough about .

him defensively. He reminds lme'of Buzzy Harrison
when he was a freshman." '

The lanky. out of position forward. has some

‘ views about both his own ability and the probabil—_

ity of continuing school without a scholarship.

“I ‘think I can produce in front of anybody. I’ve
got a lot to learn yet, but I have plenty of confi-

dence. In high school I was a guard and a swing -

man. I haven’t got the type of height (and weight)
to‘ play under the boards. I'm going to try to play

’ guard next year.

I

Grgurich is aware that Freeman could have
told him "where to go.” at anytime during the sea-

son.-Instead. the freshman admits thatschool was

in the back of his mind.

/1 "I enjoy the game,“ he said. "but.I don't even
intend to play next year without a scholarship."

At Westinghouse High School.‘ his alma mater.

Many track and field records will probably be shat-
tered today and tomorrow in the eighth annual National
V Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) championships
1 in Cobo Arena in Detroit. Several Pitt tracksters are
' likely. candidates for the demolition squad.

. Sophomore Bill Rea. winner of last weekend's IC4A
‘ long jump title, will be striving for top honors in both the
" long jump and the triple jump events.
_ , The qualifying distance for the long jump is 24-3 and
‘ ‘Rea easily surpassed this mark with his best jump this
4 season of 25-2 in the Olympic Invitational. His 49-11.
_ ' ,-achieved in the Delaware Invitational, also outdistanced
. the qualifying mark of 49-6 in the triple jump.
I Last year Rea did not place in theindoor NCAA cham-
— ‘pionships but he did cop the fifth spot in the outdoor cham-
pionships with a 25-10% leap.
, ‘ Jerome Hines willgive Rea a rough time in the long
‘ jump. Last year. Hines won the event with a 26-1.

. Andre Harris will represent Pitt in the 60-yard high‘
 hurdles. Harris met the qualifying time of 7.3 on several
occasions during the season—in the IC4A‘s, the William
and Mary Invitational. and the Fitzgerald Field House.

The top contenders who will be running against Har-

°The Steagle’ bombs

he react to impending death thusly? Neither are
Benjamin‘s playmates anything but landmarks on
his libidinal lurchings. _
Oh every so often a plane streaks ominously
overhead and we wonder: Is that the one? We
- know, though, that no bombs will be dropped and
so do the makers of the Steagle.

...Death, which allegedly sets this whole carni-
val in motion, is to them no more than a bad lay.
- no olives for the martinis.

One gets the impression that if death actually
.- filled the air. Benjamin would wrinkle his nose at
'-it and flash one of those boyishusmiles.
Which might represent one man‘s legitimate
response to the bomb but doesn't save The Steagle,
,a bomb in celluloid.

ris are the University of Pennsylvania’s Bruce Collins ,.

and Dave McMannon from Notre Dame.

Pitt’s mile relay team of Dorel Watley, Rick Weaver.
Chuck Mozingo, and Rick Jackson. will also be compet-
ing this weekend. The team ran its best time of 3:18.0 in
the Pittsburgh Invitational.

“The tops in America will be there‘ thisweekend."
stated Pitt’s coach Jim Banner. "We'll be going against
the best and I hope that luck is on our side.

‘ ‘Our fellows are very good competitors and if there’s
a chance..I know that they will do the job for us-I have
complete confidence in their ability.”

Banner’s one big disappointment was the ineligibil-
ity of Dorel Watley and Rick Jackson to compete in the
600-yard.‘run,.

Both Watley and Jackson’ bettered the qualifying
time of 1:11.0 with the times of 1:10.4 and 1:10.6. re-
spectively, Monday against Edinboro. Unfortunately the
qualifying time had to have been met by Saturday, March
4. and the two tracksters were two days too late.

Prime record breaking targets will be the sprints
and the pole vaulting events. '

Michigan State’s Herb Washington has already estab-
lished a new world’s record in the 60-yard dash with a 5.8.
Washington. who won- two years ago, placed second last
year.

Running right behind him will be Cliff Branch of Colo-
rado who is only one of many tracksters who have run a
5.9. -

When Monday afternoon rolls.
around, the unfamiliar sight, at least
for this time of year, of flying foot-
balls willfill the air above Pitt Stadi-
um. Spring grid drills have arrived.

Head Panther Coach Carl DePas-
qua has indicated that a few changes
are in store for this year’s gridders.
Offensively, DePasqua has apparently

‘succumbed to the alluring "versatility

of the Wishbone—T formation and will
integrate it into the Cats’ attack. He

   
  
  

will offset the new formation with an
old standard, the Power-I, and the
triple option with which he had limited
success last year.

Defensively, the 5-2', will be back
along with two converted linebackers
to beef up that position. Lou Julian and
John "Moss, both offensive runners
have migrated to the defensive corps.
Veterans George Feher and Gary Pat-
erson are also back, and probably will
see the most action. ‘

FRATERNITY TRACK will get underway next Tuesday night at 6

The Pikas lead Phi Gamma Delta,lthe i970-7l All,-Sports
_. Trophy winner, by 'a scant three points, 902-899, in this year’s
- competition. The Phi Kaps are a close third with 835.

Eleven starters and 29 lettermen
characterize the‘ young contingent.
Eighty-nine gridders in all should be‘
on hand Monday afternoon at 3 p.m.
when the festivites are scheduled to
begin. '

The drills will run through April
8 when Pitt’s famous Blue-Gold spring
game take place. Twenty practice ses-
sions will comprise the grueling month
of drills.

With the return of his top eight
rushers from a year ago. DePasqua

Brownes aid

Pitt skaters
in title bid

by BART MACK

It isn't very rare to find a set
of brothers playing in the world
of hockey, but to find them play-
ing on the same team is some-
thing else. The Chicago Black
Hawks boast the duo of Bobby and
Dennis _HulI while the St, Louis
Blues .imply the infamous Plag-
er brothers.

The Pitt Hockey Club has its
own version of the brother act.
and while they might not be as fa-
mous as the NHL stars. Denny
and Kerry Browne can certainly
be given credit for their part in
the skaters‘ successful season.

Denny Browne can be seen fly-

. ing up the ice on left wing with

Bill Glanville and Frank Wil-
liams. This line has been the most
productive so far this season and

Denny has eight goals to show for ’

hislefforts. , .
“We just work real good pass-
ing,” Denny commented. “We al-

ways dig the puck out for each
other.” ‘ ‘

In the meantime. Kerry will be
quietly checking his opponents at
the Pitt blue line. Teamed on de-
fense with Glen Hyde. Kerry is a
true blue-liner.

"I used to be on defense with
Duke Schaeffer and we made a
good defensive team." Kerry re-
marked. "But now since Duke is
in the nets I play with Glenn Hyde
and he's more of an offensive—de-
fenceman. He always carries the
puck more up ice, so naturally.
somebody has to stay back. so I‘ll
play more conservatively."

Both Brownes are confident
that the skaters will have no trou-
ble in the upcoming playoffs.
"We've played ‘C-MU twice and
beaten them both times." Kerry
said. "Id like to play Duquesne
again. Their goalie had a hot hand
the night we tied but I don‘t think
it could happen twice." _

As far as the championship is
concerned Denny commented. "In-
diana will be up for the game but
it won't be any problem." ,

Coach Dick Bradshaw and five of. his top swimmers are in New

Haven. Conn., this weekend, where the tankers are competing in the _

Eastern Intercollegiate Swimming Championship. ..
The tournament began last night and concludes with the awards

presentation on Sunday morning.

The Pitt contestants flew to Yale \

on Tuesday night and will return
Sunday. Nine Panther tankers
qualified, but Bradshaw only
brought those who qualified for an
individual event.

The five swimmers making the
trip are freshmen Ed Cahill and
Bernie Victor. and seniors Rick
Rowe, Fred Lewis. and Tom Hay-
es. This is the first year that
freshman were permitted to com-
pete in this tournament.

Tom Hayes will be competing
in‘ only one event, the -'50 yard
freestyle. The other mermen will
all swim in at least three events.

Ed Cahill has qualified in the
100 yard backstroke, the 200 yard
backstroke, and the 800 yard
freestyle relay. '

Bernie Victor will enter. the 100
yard butterfly. the 100 yard

breaststroke, the 100 yard back-~

stroke, and the 800 yard freestyle
relay.

Rowe will also be in the 800 re-
lay, as well as the 200,600, and
1000 yard freestyle events. Rowe
is a team captain, along with Fred
Lewis.

Lewis will be swimming in the
500 and 1000 yard freestyle. the
400 yard individual medley as
well as the 800 freestyle.

Both Lewis and Rowe set Pitt
Easterns’ records last year, but
failed to place. Based on best

times, the chances for this year's
team placing are not very good.

“Freshmen will be competing
this year and it will make the

competition tougher than ever,” ‘

said Bradshaw, “I don’t really
expect anyone to place. Our best
chances are in the 800 free relay,
the 1000 yard freestyle, and pos-
sibly the 100 fly.”

qualified for the nationals. which

will be held in two weeks at. —'
 Army. The man who had the best‘

chance to qualify. Mark Wallace.
was lost to the team for the sea-
son with mononucleosis.

The teams favored to top the
Easterns this year. according to
Yale Sports Information Director
Cap Jones, are Princeton. Dart-
mouth, Penn, and Yale.

Princeton is considered. the
front runner, and its 12-0 record
bears this out. They own this
year’s Eastern Swim League title.

Dartmouth is the defending
champion in the 400 yards free-
style relay and all four of the In-
dians are competing again this
year. The Indians are led by Craig
Colberg and Chris Carstenson.
Carstenson is also the defending
champion in the 100 yard" free-
style with a. phenomenal sprint
time of :47. '

Penn is Eastern Seaboard
champion from last year and.
along with Yale, placed high in the
Easterns last year.

most were depressed over the out-

"Without more depth nextyear.

“It’s depressing to think that

the team may never get any bet-'

F oree   bends Reggins
 0T Victory

by PAUL DeVITO

In the first of two division championship games. a tall and quick
Force team defeated the Reggins in overtime .by the score of-45-44".
Thus. Force follows the Black Flashes as the Independent League

champions.

Both teams got off to a ragged.

and sloppy start. scoring only a
total of four points in the first five
minutes of play. The Reggins.
sticking to a tight man-to-man.
harassed Force's outside shots.
Force employed a 2-1-2 zone to
stop the Reggins drives.

H As the play dragged. the teams ’
. exchanged buckets with

infre-
quent fast breaks and easy lay-
ups due to lagging zones. Finally.
with the score 14-12

‘two long jumpers and a couple of
lay—ups to make the half-time
score Force 21. Reggins 14.

Ironically, the Reggins, com-
posed of gridders .Joe Carroll,
Reggie Frye, and Joe Herndon,
were badly outmuscled by the ag-
gressive Force players on the of-
fensive and defensive rebounds. ,

‘After fiveminutes of the sec-
ond half passed, the play finally
sped-up with lightning fast-breaks
and accurate outside shooting ex-
hibited by both teams.

The score was, tied with 11 min-
utes remaining at 27 when Car-

Force. ’
,Force’s Chris Thorsen scored on‘

roll connected for a three-point
driving play to move his team
into the lead for the first time in
the game.

The lead then switched hands a
total of nine times before Reg-
gins pulled to a 40-38 lead with
seven second remaining. Chris
Thorsen then drove the length of
the court only to be fouled by Reg-
gie Frye. From the one-on-one
foul situation, Thorsen hit both
shots to tie the score at 40.

At the "start of the overtime per-
iod. the two teams shot wild and

forced shots and neither team -

scored until Thorsen‘s drive put
Force on top, 43-40.

Then, with Herndon hitting two
straight buckets and Force add-

‘ ing one more foul shot, the tie was

again tied at 44. Finally. Chris

Thorsen hit a foul shotto secure .

the victory for Force, 45-44. _

Thus. Force moves into the All-
Campus playoffs against the'Grad-
Fac runner-up while the Reggins
will meet the Grad-Fac champion.
