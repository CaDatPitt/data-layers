Freshman Women Attend

Annual Unit Assembly

Meeting in Foster Memorial Today Introduces
First Year Coeds to Extra-Curricular Work

Freshman women of the University will convene in Stephen Foster
Memorial today at 1 o’clock to attend the annual Unit Assembly. The as-
sembly will formally open the extra—curricular activities program for ﬁrst
year women which continues for the remainder of the school year.

Betty Teal, C40, chairman of the unit advisory council, will discuss the
purpose and plans of the units and will introduce the unit advisers to -the

freshmen. The units, according to
Miss Teal, are for the purpose of in-
troducing freshman women to the va-
rious types of activities represented
by the major groups on campus.

At this assembly, the girls will
learn for the ﬁrst time to which unit
they have been admitted. Each girl
had previously listed two choices, and
none of the freshmen have been plac-
ed in units which they have not
chosen. After a short program, the
freshmen are scheduled to meet in
their individual units.

Opening the program, Miriam
Goldstein, C41, plans to lead the
group in singing the Foster ballad,
“Beautiful Dreamer.” Hilda Lander-
man, C41, will accompany at the
piano.

As a representative of the senior
mentors, Helen Wilson, C40, has been
selected to speak to the freshmen.
Her address will be followed by a
talk bv Alma Nicholas, C43, repre-
senting her class.

The units and their junior class ad-
visors are: Jane Ulrich, Ed, Camera
Arts; Estella Stout, C, Publications;
Betty Springer, C, Books and Plays
(formerly Current Literary Review);
Frances Rowell, Ed, Acting; Gertrude
Foreman, Ed, Public Speaking; Jane
Vorech, C, Writing; Audrey McLaren,
Ed, French; Evelyn Westerman, Ed,
Stagecraft; Loisbelle Pryor, Ed,
Sports; and Miriam Goldstein, C, Mu-
sic.

“It is important that all freshman
women attend this assembly,” an-
nounces Miss Teal. “They will be
able to learn at this meeting the pur-
pose and activities of the various

units.”

Players Give Fine Performance
In First Production of Sea-son

By William McElwain
Pitt Players set themselves a pretty high standard of performance in
“I-'-Iind Lady,” “Brother Rat,” and Our Town” last year, and their Friday.
night version of “Three Men on a Horse” indicated that they have no

intention of lowering that standard.

The Abbott-Holm farce is not a great 
capable Players’ cast punching their lines, it was funnier still.

But it’s funny. With a
And the

audience, that most important of all‘v‘ l

critics, liked it.

There is a tendency, with a play so
well known as “Three Men on a
Horse,” to compare any production
of it to the professional show. In this
case, the comparison is not unﬂatter-
ing.

In at least three roles, the profes-
sionals could have added little. The
casting of Jim lVlcHale, -C40, as Oiwin,
the timid verse writer who just picks
the winners for fun, was perfect.
Jimmy roinped through the role as
though the authors had meant it
for him alone.

As the sentimental Mabel, Betty
Weghorst, C4‘ , was further proof
that experience is not necessary for
good acting. In her ﬁrst Players
show, Miss Weghorst talked, walked,
even looked like an ex-Follies girl.

Josephine Miale, Ed40, wasn’t on
the stage long enough to steal the
show, which is the only reason she
didn’t. As Erwin’s loving and weepy
wife, ;;l.‘lQ played her role up to the
limit without allowing it to become
overdrawn.

The funniest trio of “tough guys” to
ever hit the Foster stage were James
Napier, BA40; Sam Hamilton, BA41;
and Allan Gould, C43. Gould, a new-
comer, should appear in a 10’C more
Players productions, if he lives up
to his Friday performance.

To single out any one else for spec-
ial notice would be both difﬁcult and
unfair to the rest of Cast Which in-
cluded Bob Osterloh, C42; William
Maihl, E42; Larry Port, BA42; Mil-

Worry, worry———debates are that.
But the international crisis that
will blow up on Foster Memorial
stage Wednesday night, that is, the
debate itself, is actually a minor
worry for the University squad.
The biggest trouble is getting tux-
edos for Abe Wolovitz, C40, and
Ernest Larson, C40.

You see, Wolovitz and Larson
say they have never even worn
tuxedos, let alone owning them.

Wolovitz has been able to borrow
one (though the ﬁt is not exactly
the prime stylenote), but Larson
remains tux-less. That makes
three men with, and Larson with-
out a tux. “Something had better
happen quick!” he observes.

the debate is “Resolved: That the
United States should declare war
on Germany.” It is scheduled

Some Like It Hot

Physics lnstructors Serve Tea
To increase Meeting Attendance

By Maida VVatt

Bunsen burners in the department
of physics are doing double duty
every week. Besides the usual work
they do in the laboratory, the burners
are now being used to keep the ket-
tles hot at weekly teas.

It all began when Dr. Millard F.
Manning, assistant professor in

physics, wanted to do something to‘

get more members of the department
to attend the weekly colloquium.

He remembered from past experi-
ence at Massachusetts Institute of
Technology that a good way to make
men turn out for anything was to
feed the brutes.

At ﬁrst the whole thing was very
simple. A kettle of tea was boiled
over a bunsen burner and the tea was
served in the laboratory. Then the
“tea party,” as some of the professors
and graduate assistants began to call
it, became more formal. Guests came
from other schools, and the tea was
moved into the adjoining lecture
room. ,

Two white’ china tea pots and a
white table: cloth added dignity to
the occasion. One of the ﬂower fan-
ciers of the department even provided
a vase of paper ﬂowers for the table.

Only one thing is lacking. The
gentleman who has been making the
tea thinks that the “feminine touch”
is missing, and now he is holding au-
ditionsfor an aide. He, is looking
roi- a good-looking redhead to make
the tea and serve it. ‘

Our Jaywalkers Get
Special Attention

In_clud’cd in the plans of Student-Faculty Asso-
ciato_n’s new safety campaign committee is a stunt
which should embarrass a certain group of Univer-
sity students. The committee hopes to have a
police car equipped with a loud speaker stationed
at the coriier of Fifth avenue and Bigelow boule-
vard to broadcast the names of student “jay-
walkers.”

- iBy the time SFA’s safety campaign starts, traf-
ﬁc lights should be installed at the corner. Until
then, students would do Well to take special care
at that corner, which is still inadequately policed
despite special requests to the city from the Uni-
versity and from SEA.

Because the corner is policedso poorly, it is
important that University students avoid accidents
by staying out of the class of “jaywalkers.” Other-
wise, SFA’s safety committee is likely to be iii the
'-position of locking the stable after the horse is
gone.

Children, Schools
And a ‘Wartime Scene’

. “All our charitable organizations combined have

‘failed to send’ such members of town children’ to the-

country as Hitler has.”

.- So wrote H. L. O. Flecker, headmaster of Christ’s
Hospital, England, in the Sunday issue of the New York
‘Times a week ago. Deep in an article on the hard-
ships which primary and secondary schools are under-
{going with the evacuation of children from densely
populated sections during the present World War ap-

—;._peared this one sentence.

The idea is rather startling: that what fresh-air
{camps and the like were set up to do in a limited way
becomes a necessity through world conditions. How.
eve.c,~-taiking too many ch.ildreri_--to the country is ‘lust
as unsatisfactory as taking too few.

What the children may gain in fresh air they are
losing in education. With country school-houses at-
tempting to accommodate twice their normal amount of
.children and with school-units broken into two or more
groups, confusion is inevitable. Each child is spending
only half of his usual time in class.

A -Imagine the students of Peabody high school sud-
denly» being thrown into the’ schools of Harmony, or
Allderdice scattered through Greensburg and Franklin.
Even if such an exodus had taken place during normal
times few good results could have been expected.

It seems there is no way for children to escape the
misfortunes of war. If they stay at home, they are
liable to be bombed, and if they are moved to places of
comparative safety,‘ they lose out when it comes to
growingup under proper guidance.

This may seem to be weaseling, but we don”: mean it
that way. It is. just that there must of necessity be an
explanation about Dr. Harry Elmer Barnes’ failure to
speak here, especiallylin the light of what appeared in
this column last week.

Let’s put it emphatically: Dr. Harry Elmer Barnes
will not speak at Inquiry-1 Forum next Monday because
he will not be in town at that time. The University’s
administration has had nothing to do with the situation.

The facts are these: Dr. Barnes was to visit Dr.
Dr.
Wright offered to ask Dr. Barnes to speak at Inquiry
Forum. Inquiry accepted. Last Friday, however, word
was received from Dr. Barnes that he was unable to
reach town until six o’clock this evening. Therefore
Dr. Harry Elmer Barnes is not speaking at Inquiry
Forum today.

We also erred in another respect, last week. We
apologize for failing to discover that Dr. Barnes spoke
here in 1931, two years after the original “incident.”
Since we repeated about four times that he hadnft
spoken here for ten years, we have committed a griev-
ous sin.

Of course, it might be pointed out that Dr. Barnes

Capitol, and delivered Fourth-of-July orations to the
Daughters of the American Revolution. Nobody paid
much attention to him until, because of seniority rights,
he gained a seat in the powerful House Rules commit-
tee. In this position, the Congressman’s name became
extremely notorious, for it was his one vote, Demo-
cratic that he was, that prevented the House from vot-
ing on vitally needed social legislation.

Among other things, his vote kept the House from
adopting the Wage and Hour law, and when in a later
session it did become law, he fought violently to

eliminate the minimum wage requirements of twenty-

five cents per hour so that his Southern constituency
might continue paying its miserable sub-standard
wages.

This good Congressman, known as the Honorable
Martin Dies of Texas, is now chairman of the com-
mittce investigating un-American activities. And in
his looking-under-the-bed campaign he has found a
list of two thousand government employees whom he
calls “dangerous radicals.”

Without consulting the other members of his com-
mittee, the gentleman from Texas divulged the names
of ﬁve hundred from the list. Their names read like

' an honor roll of the most efficient and able employees

of the Federal Government. Known as educators,
Western progressives, liberal Republicans, and follow-
ers of Walter Lippmann’s column——Congressman Dies
blacklists them as the “dangerous radicals” of our time.

The basis for his startling accusation is the fact that
some of these persons were members of the Legue for
Peace and Democracy, and some of them committed the
dastardly act of contributing money to an international
organization feeding refugee victims of the Spanish
Civil war.

The Congressman sees red anytime somebody ad-
vocates a thirty-cent per hour wage when he feels the
person is entitled to only twenty cents. Were he alive
during our earlier history, Thomas Jefferson, Andrew
Jackson, Theodore Roosevelt-—and all those men who
kept a little apace of their times-—would have scared
the Congressman into hysterics.

Mr. Dies’ main trouble is his inability to separate
a progressive, patriotic American from a died-in-the-
wool radical who takes his orders from Moscow.

I think there are men in the United States who are
able to see this difference. That’s the reason Congress
owes it to the country to refuse the Congressman’s re-
quest for a new appropriation until Mr. Dies is deposed
as committee chairman.

This country needs a proper investigation and, if
possible, an expulsion of all radicals who seek to de-
stroy our cherished freedoms. We should sever the ties
of political organizations here with all foreign connec-
tions. We should exterminate the hornets nests of
subversive cliques by focusing the light of public inves-
tigation upon their darkened dens. But certainly the
Dies Committee is not serving these aims when it per-
secutes the men who are ﬁghting hardest to make de-
mocracy work. A A ‘

Jimmy Bowman of the Phi Gam’s dropped in on

Jimmy is now tutoring the Dithridge St. boys, at-

“Things is tough” was the word at the Kappa Man-

Al Snipe was the guest of Margy Day.

[Intercollegiate

There is at least one college professor who believes

Paul W. Tappan of Miami University had to say re-
cently about class recitations:

“Cleverly answered questions, with merely an iota
of an idea, always make an impression. This is what is
commonly known as ‘bull-throwing.’ Of course, none
of your teachers would admit the veracity of this fact.
Bull-throwing or tossing is an art and is not to be re-
garded as a simple task. Please do not try to bull and
bull with reckless abandon, for the professor has to
have anidea, even if a very vague idea, that the stu-
dents may know, something about? the subject.”

Panthers Edge Stubbo rn

Temple Aggregation, 13-7

Dickinson Blocks Punt to Lead to Second Pitt

Touchdown; Hawkins Stars on Pass Defense .

It took a heads-up pass defense and a blocked kick for the Pitt
gridders to gain a 13-7 victory over the Temple Owls at Philadelphia

Saturday.

After Templ.e had come from behind to tie the game at 7-7 in
the third period, Johnny Dickinson, Panther right end, blocked Jonah

Bowles’ punt and ran it back to
play scoring drive. _
The Templars were thI'OW1l’1g
passes all afternoon but Pitt inter-
cepted ﬁve and only ﬁve of the 16
Q  thrown were com-
’   ' plete. Bud Haw-
kins, making his
ﬁrst start at cen-
ter for Pitt, made
3’ two interceptions,

     
  
 
   
 
  
   

Although Cas-
siano scored his
sixth and seventh
touchdowns of the
season, it was
Narick who did
most of the Panther ground gaining.
Set to stop Cassiano, the stubborn
Temple line gave way repeatedly
to the best running Narick has done
in three years of college ball.

As has been the case in four pre-
vious games, the Panthers struck
ﬁrst. Two Pitt thrusts were stalled
but a third did the trick. The initial
tally came early in the game after
Bowles had kicked out on his own
46.

Emil to Dick for Score

Cassiano picked up four yards, then
Bonelli cracked over guard. The
Templars were offside on the play
and drew a ﬁve yard penalty. Narick
drifted back and threw a long pass
to Cassiano who took the ball on the

no

Temple two and went over. Joe
Rettinger place-kicked the extra
point.

Temple was a different team when
presented a break just after the half
began. Although Cassiano returned
Tomasic’s punt some 25 yards, a
clipping penalty nulliﬁed the run and
set Pitt back to their own 11. Cas-

the Temple seven to set up a four

siano made three yards, but Narick
fumbled on the next play and To-
masic recovered for Temple on the
19.

Bowles slashed nine yards, then
lost three. However, Berrier broke
through for a ﬁrst down on the Pitt
eight. Tomasic, speedy sophomore,
was spilled three yards behind the
line, but the ensuing play saw him
take to the right, leave his interfer-
ence, and sweep around his left end
for a touchdown. Bowles’ placement
tied the score.

Dickinson Breaks Through

The outcome of the clash was settled
a few minutes later when Dickinson
broke through from the Temple 46
to block Bowles’ fourth down kick,
pick up the loose ball, and gallop to
the Temple seven. Cassiano made
half a yard, then went wide to the
three. Narick creashed over guard
for one,_ and Dandy Dick scored on an
end run.

 

Smith Wins, Lions
Top Pitt Harriers

With ICAAAA champion “Wild
Willy” Smith leading the way, Penn
State’s cross-country team upset a
favored Panther quintet, 22-33, Sat-
urday over the ﬁve mile State Col-
lege course. It was State’s ﬁrst win
of the season in a dual meet.

Walter Sterner, Pitt captain and
star, trailed Smith by 150 yards to
take second. Captain Maule of the
Lions ﬁnished third and Pitt’s Al
Boulanger came in fourth.

Henderson, Olsen, and Miller ﬁn-
ished ﬁfth, sixth, and seventh to com-
plete the State scoring, while Mc-
Cabe, Manuwal, and Graham strag-
gled in for Pitt in eighth, ninth and
tenth positions.

During the summer Joe works for

F rosh Run Wild
Against Tartans

In 4+7-0 Triumph

By Hiram Milton

If the Pitt-Tech frosh football
game at Greensburg, Pa., Friday
night is a preview of the varsity
game, Tech supporters had better
take to the storm cellars. The little
Panthers blasted the hapless Tartans,
47-0.

The ﬁrst time Pitt had possession
of the ball, acting captain Marty Var-
daro circled left end, cut for the side-
lines, and sprinted 60 yards for a
touch down. He added the extra
point by rounding the same end.

A moment later, Pitt again had the

ball. On the second play, Vardaro
once more turned the end, then
dashed 42 yards for a score. Var-

daro’s place-kick counted the four-
teenth marker.

Tech fumbled and Pitt recovered
on the ﬁrst play after the kickoff.
Saksa passed to Hinte for a touch-

down, but an offside ruling nulliﬁed

the score. It didn’t matter though,
because Saksa then heaved a touch-
down pass to Klotz.

This time it counted. When Hinte
made the extra point on an end run
from a fake kick formation, Coaches
Raskowski and Shea mercifully sent
in the reserves.

The yearlings scored twice in the
third period. Vardaro passed 26
yards to Klotz for the ﬁrst touch-
down. Vardaro’s place-kick was
blocked. On a reverse from Bob
Malloy, Vardaro raced 16 yards for
the second score. Malloy bucked
over the extra point.

In the ﬁnal quarter, a pass inter-
ception led to a Pitt six-pointer. Mc-
Williams scored and Gur-czenski add-
ed the forty—ﬁrst point. An 88-yard
march, climaxed by a pass from Mc-
Williams to Gacsaly, rang up the
ﬁnal touchdown. '

Kristufek, Hartman

On Armory Courts

The University of Pittsburgh was
well represented at the exhibition
tennis matches which featured the
formal opening of the five new in-
door courts at the Hunt Armory last
Thursday night.

In one of the main singles matches
Joe Kristufek, present Panther net
captain, defeated Billy O’Loughlin,
net captain of several years ago, by
scores of 6-2, 4-6,_;6_-,0. In anothe};
singles match Dr. Dave O’Loughlin,
varsity tennis coach, defeated Harry
Wald, former Pitt star, by scores of
6-2, 6-2.

Joy Hartman of Pitt lost a cl.ose
one set match in the women’s singles
to Dolly Harris by the score of 9-7.
Joy later teamed up with Dolly to
win a doubles match from Mariam
Sullivan and Imogene Pﬁeffer by
scores of 6-3,6-4.

Kristufek teamed up with George
Henderson to defeat McCook Reed
and Bob Bennett 6-1, 6-3 in one dou-
bles match while Dave O’Loughlin
teamed up with his brother John, al-
so a former Pitt luminary, to down
Harry Wald and Martin Tressell in
another doubles match by scores of
-7-5, 6-3. ~

The matches were witnessed by a
gallery of about 400 net enthusiasts.

Tumblers Hold

First Practice

Pitt’s gymnastic team will open its
fall practice today under the guid-
ance of Coach Karl Oermann.

Last year was the ﬁrst year that
gymnastics had a place in the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh’s athletic pro-
gram. The ﬁrst year of a new sport
in any school is always the hardest,
and only eight candidates appeared
for opening practice.

To build up a greater interest in
gymnastics, the highly touted Spring-
ﬁeld.College team was brought to
Pittsburgh and featured in an exhi-
bition.

This year coach Oermann is ex-
pecting a greater interest in the sport.
Oermann states that he will welcome
any student who wishes to tryout for
the team, whether they have had pre-
vious expreience or not.
needed is the determination and in-
terest in the sport.

The following is the schedule for
practices:

Monday, 4:30 p m.—-Trees Gym.

SF A Committee Reveals
Plans for Campus Safety
Campaign, Football Dance

1 University Will Sponsor Aﬂair at Heinz House

After Saturday’s Pitt-Tech Football Encounter
Plans for a ceremony to be held at Christmas, for a campus safety
campaign, and for a dance after the Pitt-Tech game were revealed at
the meeting of the executive committee of the Student-Faculty A.sso-

ciation last Thursday.
Heinz House will be the scene

of the dance after Satui-day’s foot-

ball game, according to Joseph L. Roberts, C41, chairman of the social

committee. Admission will proba-"

bly be 15 cents a person or 25
cents a couple. Decorations will
be put‘ up by members of the SFA
appointments committee, Roberts’ re-
port stated.

The campus safety campaign,
scheduled for December 4 to 9, was
announced by David Buente, C41,
chairman of the special safety cam-
paign committee of SFA. Coopera-
tion has been promised by Donald
McNeil, city traffic engineer.
Bumper Posters

Posters for automobile bumpers
will be distributed, and a safety dis-
play will be held in the Commons
Room, Buente stated. A short safety
ﬁlm will be shown at the Essefay
theater between showings of the reg-
ular picture for the week.

Two 15-minute radio programs are
to be broadcast over KQV. Members
of Pitt Players will present short
plays during the broadcast periods.

It is hoped that a police car equip-
ped with a loud-speaker will be sta-
tioned at Fifth and Bigelow with a
student broadcasting names of stu-
dent jaywalkers at that corner. A
safety test with prizes has also been
tentatively planned for the campaign.
Code of Rivalry , *

Pat Cusick, E40, president of SFA,
reported to the committee on the
meeting held between University and
Carnegie Tech students to establish
a code of rivalry between the two
schools. SFA will investigate the pos-
sibility of having a bronze plaque for
the goal posts engraved with the
scores of the Pitt—Tech games. For
the present a wooden plaque will be
used.

Alumni Sponsor

Ballet Program

Yurek Shabelevsky’s corps de bal-
let will present a special performance
in Syria Mosque, November 20, un-
der the sponsorship of the University
General Alumni Association, in co-
operation with May Beegle. \

According to the announcement of
Eugene Burkhart, Alumni secretary,
the concert will represent the largest
production ever undertaken by the
association, as an entertainment for
University a1umnj_

F0u0Wing the performance, a re-
ception will be held in the ground
floor of the Syria Mosque.

The ballet ensemble was created
this season, under the patronage of
Mr. Gilbert Mendelssohn, wealthy
New~‘York producer. M. Shabelev-
sky, formerly leading soloist of the
Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, was
urged by Mendelssohn to select a
troupe to present a unique program
111 the American art scene. His two
selections were Sonie Woicikowska,
daughter of a Polish ballet virtuoso,
and Jane Deering, versatile Philadel-
phia dancer who made her profes-
sional debut with the Philadelphia
ballet company in 1936.

Plans are being completed by the
Polish nationality room committee
and the alumni for the concert and
reception. Miss Beegle will announce

rates and details of the public per-

formance this week.

Faculty Group

Will Hear Talk
By Kirkpatrick

Forrest H. Kirkpatrick, dean of
Bethany college, will speak at a fac-
ulty dinner meeting Wednesday eve-
ning at 6 o’clock in the Faculty Club
dining room, Dr. Omar C. Held, per-
sonnel assistant to the dean of Col-
lege, announces.

Dr. Kirkpatrick will speak on “Our
Responsibility in Finding and En-
couraging Individual Students.”

Purpose of the meeting, Dr. Held
states, is to permit faculty advisers
and orientation teachers to discuss
their common problems in regard to
courses and students. In the College
there are 25 faculty advisers each of
whom is responsible for a group of
approximately 15 students.

Explaining the problem, Dr. Held
points out that the University is a
large institution with an enrollment
of 14,000 students and that the fac-
ulty must be on the alert lest the ed-
ucational program become imperson-
al. Although he does not believe that
a small student body is a guarantee
of individualized education, neither
does he believe that a large enroll-
ment means impersonal education. A
faculty advisory scheme, he indicates,
can do much to preserve the personal
touch in college education.

Local Business
Continues Rise

Business continued its advance in
the Pittsburgh district with an in-
crease in volume over last week, ac-
cording to the Bureau of Business
Research.

After allowance for the usual sea-
sonal changes, the Bureau’s index of
general business advanced from 120.9
in the week ending October 21 to
124.5 last week, a gain of 46.0 points
over the same week last year.

Most of the rise was due to expan-
sion in volume of production and
shipments, but the peak in most in-
dustries has passed, the Bureau re-
ports. River traﬁic, rail shipments,
bituminous coal and electric power
production reached new high levels
for the year. Department store sales
declined while retail sales increased
this last weel~:.

liness typical of the modern American girl.
