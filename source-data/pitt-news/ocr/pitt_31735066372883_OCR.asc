Speakers
Push For
More Aid

By LYNNE LACEY
And LAURIE MocLEOD

"Stand up and be counted and
help yourself to an education.
Don’t let the opportunity slip by
because some drone in Harrisburg
or Washington feels you don't
deserve it,“ said state _representative
Frank Pistella, one of the speakers
at the Speakers’ Forum on Friday.

Sponsored by the Student
Government Task Force on Finan-
cial Aid, the forumwas designed to
seek first-hand information about
the cutbacks. Speaking before a
small group of concerned Pitt stu-
dents in David Lawrence Audito-
rium were Pistella,’ U.S.
representative‘ William Coyne,
Allegheny County Commissioner
Cyril Wecht, U.. . representative
Doug Walgren, PHEAA regional
director Laverne Borst andjoyce

Sheariss, spokesman for US. sena-.

tor Arlen Spector.

Pistella said that the state and

Gov. Thornburgh’s administra-
tion has done “absolutely
nothing” to help the financially
needy college students. He noted
that student aid has increased by
only 7- percent over the last three
years, while tuition has risen -by 40
to 50 percent. ’

“What "this administration is
proposing for 1982-83 is increasing
"tuition by 18 percent and only
increasing student aid to you arid
your family by 9 percent,” said Pis-
tella. “We should try to make a
good education available to every-
one. This year isn’t the time to
decide education is only for a select
few."

Pistella said that while the
Thoiznburgh Adtninistration
claims to be issuing the greatest
amount of financial aid dollars
ever, it doesn't mention that last
year's.funds ran out before all ‘the
money was distributed. He also
noted that the eligibility require-
ments for PHEAA grants, were
revised last year when Thornbttrgh
initiated a 10- perceni cut across the
board to compensate for the lack of
funds, now making it more diffi-
cult for college students to receive

The Student Government Board
(SGB) reviewed Student Govern-
ment groups’ budgets for fiscal
year 1983 during a three hour and
40 minute meeting Friday. ’

SGT} accepted the 22-page
budgef for the Resident Student
Association (RSA). P

The accepted budget did not
include funding the requested stu-
dent telephone directory for each
resident room. RSA representative
Joe Simoni strongly objected to_
this, saying he realized a directory
in each student's room was a con-
venience, “RSA is here to please the
student.” Simoni also said directo-
ries would promote the RSA.

Profile: Serafinog“Foge” Fazio, Football Coach A

‘M-ThE<Pin«hIéws,~Monday; .iwiamh«22,rr932

By BILL HESS

As far as his basic biographical
sketch goes, Serafino Dante Fazio
seems like an ordinary anybody.
He’s married and has two children,
a 14-year-old daughter and an ll-
year-old son. He and his family
reside in Moon township, a resid-
ental area west of Pittsburgh. He
has a nickname, “Foge,” which
grew out of his futile childhood
attempts to pronounce the word
“fudge.”

He would seem ordinary if this
was his whole story, but earlier this
year Fazio became the indirect
beneficiary of a deal that sent
former Pitt football coach Jackie
Sherrill to Texas A8cM. Consider-
ing the controversy Sherrill7s
departure created, Fazio seems
remarkably at home behind his
new desk in Pitt’s head football
coach’s office, a comfortable roo_m
buried in the confines of Pitt
stadium. , -

As for Tris personal feelings
about the Texas A&M controversy,
Fazio says, “The Aggies are a
wealthy, tight-knit group. They're
in a part of Texas that is isolated
from other types of entertainment,
such as professional sports,‘ so
they're willing to pay the price to
get a good team.”

Fazio, who was born in a small
coal mining town in Virginia, can
safely speak with authority about
football-related issues. Since his
high school days in Coraopolis,
Pa., where his family moved when
he was four years old, his life has
centered around the game. He
received All-State honors at Corao-
polis High School, and was an
Honorable Mention All-American

at Pitt, where he earned a degree in

political science in 1960. Follow-
ing a brief professional football
career as a linebacker for the Bos-
ton Patriots of the old American
Football Conference, Fazio
returned to Pitt as a graduate assist-
ant football coach. He had consi-
dered going. to .law school, but
decided instead to pursue a degree
in education, which he received in
1964 from Pitt. For the next I3
years, he held various teaching and
coaching positions at high schools
and colleges, and in 1977, he was
named assistant head coach and
defensive coordinator at Pitt.

Under Fazio’s direction, Pitt’s
defense ranked number one in the
nation in both 1980 and 1981, and
was second in 1979. This success
surely figured heavily in the
administration’s decision to pro-
mote Fazio to the head coaching
position following Sherrill’s sud-
den resignation.

“I never had dreams of being
head coach at Pitt because I never
thought itwould happen," said
Fazio. “Even during the specula-
tion over Texas A8cM I told people,
‘You know Jackie, he’s going to
turn it down.’ I wasn’t surprised
the administration hired me,
though. I've always had good ties
with them. I was surprised they
acted so quickly in naming me.”

Fazio is closelyytied with the
entire university and the city of
Pittsburgh. He never turns down a

.. request. to help a local charity. He

and several other sports celebrities
sang with Dinah Shore at a local
Junior Achievement function last
Thursday, and he «is honorary

chairman of the Leukemia Society

golf tournament.

“I’ve gotten a lot from Pitt, andl
feel I have a great job here. The
school and city have been good to

with academics.

me, and I feel I owe them some-
thing. Working with charities, I
feel, is one way for me to accomp-
lish this," said Fazio.

It’s easy to see that Fazio doesn't
fit the traditional stereotype of a
football coach whose entire life
reyolvesaround football. He’s a
dedicated father, and he likes to
spend the ‘off-season with his
family.

~ “I keep pretty busy with the team*_

during the off-season,but'I like (0
keep to myself during July and be
with my family. My boy plays Lit-
tle League, and it’s always nice to
be able to watch him play," said
Fazio. “I also like to take the family
down to Hilton Head (South
Carolina) or Florida duringJuly to
spend some time on the beach."

When coupled with his nice-guy
personality, Fazio’s opinions
about academics in relation to
sports make him seem similar to
Penn State's Joe Paterno, in that
both coaches believe academics
must have a place in collegiate
athletics.

“As a coach, I don’t want to iu

give lip-service. I graduated froi 

Pitt as a player, and it would be
foolish for ine as a coach not to
encourage the players and make
them work hard academically,”
said Fazio. “There’s been a remar-
kable change in attitude herein the
past five years, Julius Dawkins,
Tim Lewis, Dan Marino and
Jimbo Covert all came up to me
wanting to go to school this spring
so they can graduate within four
years—-and these guys will all be
going to the NFL.” V

Weight Loss
Pitt Goal R

, Between 50 and 80 million
individuals in the United States,
are 20 percent or more over-
weight. Their nutritional prob-
lems are accentuated by the
ineffectiveness of standard
weight loss programs.

ate School of Public Health will
begin a new program of weight
reduction for the obese on
March 23rd. The program,
entitled “Slim into Spring,”
will study two different
methods of weight loss through
a combination of nutritional
and behavioral techniques. The
fundamental role of exercise in
weight loss will also be stressed.
Participants will be given

which they can lose approxi-
mately two pounds per week. In
addition, one group will also be
limited to an intake of 650»caIo-

’~’¥-\ries per day twice a week. These

Qjitpeople will also incorporate a

liquid food product into their
diet to ensure adequate
nutrition.

According to-Joan Horbiak,
R.D., research nutritionist in
the deparment of epidemiol-

the development of a well-
balanced eating style incorpo-
rating a wide variety of foods.
We think our program provides.
what other weight loss pro-
grams do not—-it avoids medi-
cal risks and excessive costs, it
produces weight loss and per-
mits a proper atmosphere in
which a nutritional behavior
program can operate._ And it
allows dieters to deal with food
in a structured way which has
the qualities of premeasure-
merit and nutritional balance."

“The Thornbtirgh administra-
tion may claim it's working hard to
satisfy the students’ needs; it’s not,"
said Pistella. “It's taking students
on an ‘Alice through the looking
glass’ tour of higher education."

Walgren warned that federal stu-
dent aid “will be cut by 47 percent
this year,” with the majority of this
and other budget cuts hitting the
broad, middle income bracket of
society.

“The public believes that we're
cutting the budget for tax breaks,”
said Walgren. “That’s the furthest
thing from the truth. The cuts are
made to provide for massive expen-
ditures in the military.”

Walgren said the cuts in finan-
cial aid that Reagan is proposing
equals the price of one new nuclear
aircraft carrier or about $2 billion.

Walgren gave the following" per-
centages in the various federal aid
student aid programs:

0 Pell Grants cut by 40 percent

0 National Direct Student Loans
cut by 37 percent

o College Work-Study cut by 50
percent

0 Guaranteed Student Loans cut
by .30 percent

0 Suppleinental I*'.tlucational
Opportunity (}{l‘illllS- cut by 100
perceiit

“ff society ,doesn't have a broad-

economic competition in other
countries,” said Walgren. “We’re
falling woefully behind."

According to Coyne, the country
is beginning to taste the bitter
fruits of last year’s $750 billion tax
cut that favored the well-to-do and
mass increase in military spending.

“Reagan is protecting his tax
cuts and increasing the military
budget.” said Coyne. “These prop-

‘osals could limit the right of educa-

tion to the very wealthy and very
poor.”

Coyne warned that the added
burden placed on schools because
most student aid goes directly to
the schools, could force many of
them to close. .

While higher education in this
area will l)e the primary loser due
to the proposed cuts, Coyne
pointed out that it’s not the only
one.

“When one realizes that the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh is the largest
employerin Pittsburgh, the entire
area's general economy will also be
adversely affected by the Reagan
administration,” Coyne said.

Sheariss said Spector considers
“an investment in education an
investment in the future of
America."

She said it was written in The
Pittsburgh I’ress that Spector pre-
dicts Congress to block White
House efforts to cutback student
aid.

“Providing funds for the educa-
tion of young Americaiis is the best
iiivestiiieiit we can make for our
future." said Sheariss.

Wecht called Reag;in‘s cuts in
financial aid “an annouiicement to
the world” that the country has no

“Why sliouldn’t the government
make a very modest investment in
these potential wage earners now
and make up for it in tax revenues
later?” Wecht asked. “In «many
respects it’s immoral and unethical
to cut sgudents out.”

Wecht said universities’ efforts to
fight the student aid cuts, either
individually or collectively, are
useless in Pennsylvania.

"State supported schools now
ha\ 2 a gag order placed on them by
the governor's off ice,” Wecht said.
“They can't say anything because
they don't have permission to do
so. This action is further evidenced
by Thoriiburgh’s enthusiastic sup-
port of the president's policies and
record."

All speakers emphasized the
importance of individual action to
fight student aid cutbacks.

Walgren suggested that when.
students write to their representa-
tives, they present their individual
situation in a way that it will
become “personal" to the represen-
tatives. Then, he added, focus on
the total budget process, not merely
on that of the appropriations
process.

(Ioyne advised that lobbying
efforts continue to “keep pressure
on representatives as students did
on the recent trip to Washington.

Pistella einphasi‘1.ed that phone

calls and letters are effective despite

the fact -that the public often inis—
takenly thinks they're not.

“The powers that deterinine
whether this goes through are the
presideiit, with his veto. and the

Walgreii said. “'I‘hecoui1try’s now

argued that it “feels” the same to be resident in Shanghai as in Pittsburgh, while others have stressed the cultural
differences said to give rise to different urban patterns. This course, administered jointly by six Asian Studiesfaculty,
attempts to answer this and related questions by examining the origins and development of cities in Asia. Four themes
will predominate in out discussions of various cities in Asia at different points in their history: 1) the physical
environment of the city and its evolution; 2) the individual urban dweller as citizen of a city and state; 3)the relationship
of the city to the countryside which surrounds it, and to other cities, and 4) the symbolic aspects of city life;

Protest

By DANA REED

Fighting the cutbacks in stu-

of the Progressive Student Net-
work (PSN) .

On March 27, the PSN, a rec-
ognized student organization at
Pitt, together with the Central
American Mobilization Coali-
tion, will send l0 chartered
buses to _a national demonstra-
tion in Washington D.C.,
which has been organized to
protest U.S. involvement in El
Salvador. March 27 is also the
day before the presidential elec-
tions in El Salvador.

“On the 27th over 100,000
people are going to come to DC
to protest the phony elections
and the US. war in El Salva-
dor?’ said Kevin I)anyi, PSN
executive co-chairman. “The :
elections on March 28 are a
farce. The left has been

‘ excluded from the elections. As
was the case in Guatemala a few

him in the classroom, and I want to
see him in other sports.

“If a kid does well academically

he’s ambitious. If he does well in
his early years and then slacks off

Fazio wants to be visible in the

and he wants them to know his

“When I was named head coach,
the players seemed to look at me
kind of differently all of a sudden.
They used to just pop into my
office and sit down, but now some-
times they’Il knock and ask if they
can sit down,” said Fazio. “Still, I
want them to look at me as a

total game to rub off on them."

Where Was
Everyone?

Whatever students were tryingto say at Friday’s
speaker’s forum on budget cuts, at least one message
came through loud and clear-—they’re not all that
interested in how their education will be paid for.

Despite the presence of political heavyweights
such as U.S. Reps. Doug Walgren and William
Coyne, Allegheny County Commissioner and sena-

torial candidate Cyril Wecht, State Rep. Frank Pis- -
‘tella, 'PHEAA regional director Laverne Borst, the

‘fourm on financial aid for students drew only a
sparse crowd to David Lawrence Auditorium. ,

It would be easyto dismissthe whole issue-by
noting once again that students are basically apa-

thetic, worried only about going to parties and'get- ’
ting a job (in that order). But the lesson to be learned a

from- all this is not that we should complain one
more time about something that’s been complained
about so many times before. .

_ Instead, _it’s important to stress the seriousness of

A the financial aid cuts and to emphasize what stu-

t<' ‘ 

dents can do about them.

Wecht made it clear in his talk how dangerous he
thinks the cuts are. A‘ A

“(They’r_e) an announcement to the world that we
in America have no faith in~our greatest asset," the
young of our nation-. Why shouldn’t_ the government
makea very modest investment in these potential
wage earners now and make up for it in tax revenues
later?" he asked. ' i  i ,

Other speakers pointed out aspects of Reagan’s
budget that have been criticized before: the increases
in defense spending, cuts that favor the well-to-do
and the elimination of social programs.

They explained that these budget policies have a it
stifling effect on education. Reagan’s proposals ,

“could limit the right of education to the very
wealthy and the very poor," Coyne said.

Beyond the criticisms, there were suggestions and
examples of concrete things concernedstudents can
do. .

“Ask your representatives not to vote for ‘any
budget‘ that doesn't include your program,”

' Walgren said, stressing that it’s also important for

students towrite to their representatives.

The other speakers added that students should
apply pressure on.their representatives to veto the
cuts. Rep. Pistella said thatmaking phone calls and
writing letters are effective ways to reach representa-
tives. They made it clear that there is something
st”udenis carido to "fight the cuts.

Judging from Friday’s turnout, it’s unlikely that

Pitt sudents will domuch of anything: And it’s too i

bad, because in the end, they’re the ones who will be
paying’ for it all.

Dear. Editor:

I'm confused as to what is meant
by the phrase journalistic responsi-
bility. Because I 'don’t dig in my

' pockets for 40 cents, I don’t pretend

The Pitt'News is The New York
Times. On the other hand, I realize,
or hope, that opinions on these
pages force us to think.

 Our opinions are based on facts.
When I wrote the article about Ger-

. many re—unifying (Column, March

2, “Motives in Re-unifying Ger-
many”), the opinion I offered was
based on the fact that Germany and
the ‘Soviet Union established ties

' which helped Germany to re-arm.
. William A. Pierce, in his March 8

critique of me in The Pitt News

(Letter to Editor, “Column Off-

Target on Rapallo”), agrees with
me when'he states, “The treaty
.called for Germans to secretly build

iarmament factories in the Soviet

’Union.". Mr. Pierce missed the

most important part of the article,.

1 however. There are historical
situations which need ' to be
avoided. .

As students we should be asking
questions aswell as searching for
answers, although we have a ten-

dency to think of the latter as being
more important. Mr. Pierce,-after‘

his critique, offers his opinion that

“US. leaders should think of the‘

Soviet leaders as more rational
thinkers and not asisome huge,
monolithic bear trying to gobble
up the world with every move.”
We should get away from this
first-grade liberal outlook towards
conservatives. Does ,-Mr. Pierce
happen to know how U.S. leaders
think of Soviet leaders? .

What should be troubling us is‘

that we, the public, don't know all
the facts needed to judge Soviet
intentions. And if President Rea-
gan wants to fight the spread of
Communism, he ought to provide
evidence to swayhus to his side.
Insteadihe states that the press, i».e.,
The New York Times and The
Washington Post should “trust us

Editoria|OpinionBas

and put themselves in our hands.”
To me, that sounds like a Nixon or
a fascist remark. Reagan can only

..abuse the press so long before the

press returns the favor. -

I, myself, thank God for the_east-
ern media, which includes The Pitt
News. The editor and staff of this
paper together with all those who
help to put out The Pitt News
receive little credit where much is
deserved. To show journalistic
-responsibility is a tricky business.
'Bo.b.Woodward and Carl Bernstein
once rinted an article that prema-

   

edon Fact,

turely accused Haldemanof aiding .

in the cover—up of Watergate. Press
Secretary Ron Ziegler quickly
responded:“I personally feel that

this is shabby journalism by The .

Washington Post.” V
Who has the better track record,
the press or the government? I
know which one I would give my
vote of confidence to.

Lady Swimmers
Eighth In Nation

By scorr DELLETT

 .

For thetPitt Lady Panther swim
team, the Association of Intercolle-
giate Athletics for Women (AIAW)
National Swimming Champion-
ships was a chance to show how far
the swimming program has pro-
gressed under the leadership of a
new coach against the best in the
nation. judging from the results
that came out of Austin, Texas, Pitt
athletics have another team to be
proud of.

The Lady Panthers finished the
four-day competition with 237
points which was enough for

‘‘eighth place, the best finish ever by g

A §i\Lady Panther swim team, beating
Kiottt the team’s 12th place showing
» in 1979, when Pitt hosted the -.

championships. The University of
Texas—the host school for the
championships-—won the meet in
outstanding fashion, out-pointing
second place Florida State 754-375.

Coach Dave Belowich’s goals for
the meet were to have as many
swimmers gain”"’A1l-America
honors as possible and a Top"l0
team finish. He certainly hit these
goals as six swimmers were named
All-America for their top eight fin-
ishes. School records_ were falling
as fast as the Pitt swi'inmers covered
the Texas Swimming‘ Center pool

and many Lady Panthers were

breaking their personal best times,

some by nearly five seconds.

The Lady Panthers started the
competition on Wednesday with
Sue Heon who, according to Belo-
wich “had her finest meet ever.”
Heon finished second in the 500-
yard freestyle with a time of 4:50.44,
which was a career best and a
school record by seven seconds.

Amy Jackson, who finished one
of the most illustrious careers ever
for a Pitt Lady Panther swimmer,
finished sixth in the 50-yard but-
terfly with a time of 25.47 and then
combined with Heon, Jan Ujevich
and Julie Terrell in the 400-yard
medley relay to finish sixth with a

time of 3:54.40. Both finishes qual-~ « H

ified for All-America honors and
gave the Lady Panthers 10th place
after the first day. ]ackson’s All-

America honors put her in select‘

company with Tony Dorsett,
Hugh Green and former swimmers
Kathy Stetler and Suzanne Pulley

as Pitt’s only four-time_ All-

Americas.

_ The Lady Panthers continued
their opening day success on
Thursday. Jackson set a new
school record in the 200-yard free-
style by finishing sixth with atime
of 1:50.62 and in the 100-yard but-
terfly (55.53). Both finishes were

also good for All-America honors.

For the fourth year in a row, Rick
Carter has taken hisswimming
power as far as college swimming
goes. Qualifying for NCAA
Nationals with his fastest times
ever, Carter will be entered in a
staggering total of five events in

. this week's championship meet.

Carter has dominated the East in
freestyle events since his freshman
season at Pitt. This year was no
exception, as Carter qualified
nationally as anchor man in all
three of Pitt’s relays, as well as the
individual 50- and 100-yard free-
style races. These are the same five
events Carter and his teammates

swept first places in at last year's‘

Easterns. At this year's Easterns,
Carter won four of his six freestyle
events, while placing second in the

800-yard freestyle relay and third in .

the 200-yard freestyle.

“Our end-of-season taper of laps
and. weights has me the best l’ve
ever been,” said Carter. Carter and
his seven teammates that also qual-
ified for Nationals have put in
many hours of hard work to get
there. Panther Coach Fred Lewis
and his team will leave this after-

-noon for Milwaukee_With ‘Christ-

mas Kill’ (the Panthers’ 800 lap per
day Christmas holiday training)
far behind and only three days of

swimming left in his final colle- V

giate season, Carter will be swim-
ming the hardest and fastest meet
of his life.

Carter has a 6-8 frame that can
destroy his opponents‘ psyche
without Carter even getting
pumped up. It's amazing to think
how close Carter, was to being a
basketball player.

“I was the tallest guy to go out
for seventh grade basketball," said
Carter. “But that extra height was
hard to control with as fast as I was
growing back then. Ididn't seem to

America honors tour consecutive years.

have the basketball drive in me
either. I like staying in shape,.so
when someone suggested I try
swimming, I figured ‘why not.” I
had no idea what competitive
swimming was in eighth grade. I
figured the guy who won was the
one who swam the furth_est under-
water. In my first practice I died
doing the warmup. But the coach,
Don Geyer, recognized’ something
in’ me and showed me how to do
flip turns and everything else,”
Carter added.

“I had always like swimming

when I was younger,” Carter said.

“My parents had a‘ boat so we spent
a lot of time around water. I
remember how I always wanted to
swim from this one picnic-type
island over to another jungle-
looking island about 300 yards
away that had one of those Tarzan
swings on it. My dad said that if I

wanted to go over, I had to swim’

over. My mom was a lifeguard, so
with her in the boat and my uncle
swimming beside-me, I made my
first swim over to that island. I

think it's that kind of fun that I've

had with swimming that has kept
me into it all along."
Carter seems to make fun out of

even the hardest of practices. Dur-'

ing practice he whistles while he
kicks, bums songs while he swims
thousands of yards, and plays just
enough tricks to controi the pain of
the extra yardage Lewis-has him

Carter’s ability to. swim the
toughest workouts shows clearly in
his pre-Eastern rankings in the
long distance freestyle events. Both
Carter and senior teammate, Sandy
Pigeon, were highly ranked in the
500—yard freestyle, but neither
swam it at regionals. since both
had qualified in many other races
where they were ranked even
higher.

Penn St. Awesome;
Swamp Gymnasts

By MIKE ROSE

The Pitt Panther men's Gym-
nastics team closed out its season
with a loss to the awesome Penn
State team, 281.30-266.95.

Penn State, third-ranked nation-
ally, dominated every event to ring
up its highest score this year.

How good was Penn State?
Panther Bob ‘Besong set a Pitt
record on the High bar with a 9.6
score and it still wasn't good
enough for first place. Penn State's
lowest score on the high bar was a
9.3.

The Panthers did not [are much
better in the parallel bars. Frank
Kratz was the leading scorer for Pitt
with a 9.25, and didn’t win the
event either.

Pitt stayed pretty even with Penn
State in the vault. The Panthers
lost the event 47.75-47.00. Dave
Smith and Besong tied for third
with scores of 9.5.

Pitt also stayed close to Penn
State in the floor exercise, losing
again by only three-fourths of a
point.Besong easily took first-
place in this event.

Penn State ran away with the

A side horse competition, one of their

strongest events. “Nooch"Capani
took fifth-place and was Pitts’s top

scorer with a 9.15.

Penn State dominated the rings
in the same way they dominated
the -meet—everybody scored high.
Marty Sendek and Besong were the
leading scorers for Pitt in this
event.

Panther Coach Frank D‘Amico
was hoping for a 270 score but he
was not sure if his team could gain
such a high mark. Pitt gave good
performances but it is just not in
the same class as Penn State. Still,
the Panthers’ should be good
enough to put them in the Top 20.

Seniors Joe Femiani, Besong,
Sendek, and Capani performed for

the last time on the Pitt gymnastics‘

team since they will graduate this
year.

With the regular season now
completed, Besong, Kratz, and
Smith are all waiting for official
word that they have, for the second
consecutive year, qualified for the
NCAA National Championships.

All three gymnasts have high
enough scoring averages to win a
bid to Nationals, but the bids are
often extended arb’itra'r'ily—a re-
gional committee awards the
invitations—a good scoring aver-
age does not necessarily ensure a
bid.

Astros, Dodgers’ Pitching Has Them Flying High

By FREDERICK BEERS

— The Houston Astros and Los
Angeles Dodgers figure to be flying
high, in this year's race for the

“ National League West flag, and

with good reason——both squads are
loaded with talent.

In Houston, the Astros possess
one of the best pitching staffs in the

-majors. Led by fireballer Nolan

Ryan, who had the league's lowest
earned run average (ERA) last year,

' and Don Sutton, who should be
recovered enough from a knee ‘

injury to‘ complement Ryan, the
Astros should take the West flag

were thefourth worst in the league
in that department. Improvement
in this category will ensure the
Astros of the division title_.

1n__other de artments, the Astros
are strong. hey have good speed
and defense and shored up a few
tender spots in the line-up with the
acquisitions of Phil Garner last
August and Ray Knight over the
winter.

Art Howe will be at first base,
with Garner at second, Knight at
third and Craig Reynolds or Dickie
Thon at short, while the outfield
will be composed of Jose Cruz,
Terry Puhl and Tony Scott. Alan

With Jerry Reuss, Burt Hooten
and Bob Welch, the Dodgers have

solid starting pitching: Their‘

bullpen may not be that of the New
York Yankees’ but itis above aver-
age with Steve Howe, Dave Stewart
and Dave Goltz, and Terry Forster.

The ‘aging infield of Garvey,
Lopes, Cey and Russell was finally
broken up. Lopes was shipped off
to Oakland in favor of Steve Sax,
who will take over his shortstop
position.

The outfield has also been
changed. Dusty Baker remains in
left, while Pedro Guerrero moves
into center and newcomer Jorge

and the Reds’ other minor league
affiliates, however, are alive and
well. _

Year in and year out the Reds are
written off as contenders, yet they
still manage to remain in the thick
of things.

And a farm system that has been
one of the most productive in the
game is the reason why.

The pitching staff, led by Tom
Seaver, includes such homegrown
talent as Mario Soto, Frank Pastore
and Benny Berenyi. The bullpen is
also strong with the likes of Tom
Hume and Jim Kern, as well as
youngster Jim Price. Only Seaver

Dave Smith, who both had ERAS-

But while the Astros possess an

The Pitt Panther men's volley-
ball teain ruled the court, defeating
George Mason University, in three
straight games, 15-7, 15-8, and I5-
13 Saturday night at Trees Hall.
That brings their Eastern League
record to 4-2. '

It was the work of a united and
determined Pantei‘ team that gave
the Patriots all they could handle.

In the first game, the Pitt Spikers
got into the groove of their game.
George Mason challenged at some
points, but the Panthers held out
for a 15-7 victory.

The second game featured fresh-
man Tony Zortea, who proved he’s
back from an early season knee
injury. Zortea’s jumping ability
allowed him to tip the ball over
George Mason’s blockers or just
drive a hard spike past them.

Gene “Geno” Larson and senior
Brian Devine gave George Mason a
hard time, driving hard spikes that
were too much to handle. Larson
kept Pitt ahead throughout the
game, with several tremendous div-
ing saves.

Sophomore and team captain
Gary Groshner was very impressive
at his outside position, demon-
strating a soft touch, as he tipped
several balls over George Mason’s
double blocks. Once again, the
Panthers prevailed, winning 15-8.
In the final game, a frustrated
George Mason team gave the Pan-
thers their toughest game victory.

The Panthers and Patriots went
point for point, as the Patriots tried
to stay alive in the best—out—of-five-
game match.

With the score 8-7, the two teams
engaged in a great rally, with both
teams making great blocks and
hard driven spikes, but Pitt's leap-
ing ability shone, as they won the
rally.

Panthers Bill Knuth and Mike
Petock kept Pitt in the hard fought
battle. Petock made several low
digs on George Mason spikers.
Knuth made several hard spikes to
give the Panthers the serveat 14-13,
as Zortea served for the match point
to give the Panthes a 15-13 victory.
junior /\ll—I{ast setter Dave Baird
proved he’s worthy of the title, con-



Glen Larson

fusing the George Mason defend-
ers, setting all over the court and
faking many sets, by putting the
ball over the net himself.

_ “It was an excellent match,” said
Pitt Head Coach Ray Reilly.

Everyone played well;

“We’ve locked up third place in
the East, but we're out for more.
We'll have to work hard for our
upcoming matches with Penn

State.”

This weekend the Pitt Spikers
will host the Pitt Classic, involving
several league foes.

The Panthers suffered ‘a tough
break as junior Dan O'Donnell,
back after an ankle injury, tore car-
tilage in his knee at practice and
will be out for the rest of the season.

With the toughest part of the sea--

son coming up, the Panthers will
have their work cut out for them.
Their goal is to win Easterns, but
first they must defeat Penn State
and Rutgers—Newark on the way.

‘We’ve got our game together,”
said Reilly. “We have our work cut

out for us. We’re on an upswing
now just in time for Penn State.

Astros, Dodgers’ Pitching Too Strong

Hrabosky, plus a wealth of young
talent. Still, something is
missing—tlte right chemistry.
The Braves stood pat during the
off-season, but a year’s worth of
experience should help the club
improve on last seasons
performance. -
Atlanta is strong defensively and
has the potential to be the same
offensively. Pitching is shakey and
the bench is slightly improved.
The line-up will probably have
Bruce Benedict catching, Chamb-
liss at first, Glenn Hubbard at
second, Rafael Ramirez at short,
Homer at third, Brett Butler in left,
Murphy in center, and Washing-
ton in right.
The pitching, staff features
Niekro, while Rick Mahler,
Tommy Boggs, Bob Walk, Steve

Bedrosian and Larry McWilliams
battle for the other spots. Garber,
Hrabosky and Rick Camp will be
in the bullpen. .

Despite a busy off-season, the
San Fransico Giants failed to
improve the overall quality of their
club.

Pitcher Vida Blue and right-
fielder Jack Clark provide the few
bright spots in an otherwise dull
line-up. Shortstop Johnnie Le
Master has shown signs of star
quality.

Besides Blue on the mound, the
Giants have newly acquired Rich
Gale and Dan Schatzder, as well as
youngsters vieing for jobs. Doyle
Alexander threatens to sit out the
season because of a contract
dispute.

Reggie Smith will probably start

at first, Duan Kuiper and Joe Mor-
gan battle for the job at second,
LeMaster is the shortstop, Darrell
Evans will be the third basemen
and Clark is in right, while Chilli
Davis and Jeff Leonard decide who
will be in left and center. Mild May
will be the catcher.

Blue, Gale, Schatzeder and
youngsters Alan Fowlkes, Mike
Chris and Bill Laske_y round out
the starting rotation. In the
bullpen, the Giants have Greg
Minton, Al Holland (who could
also start), Doug Capilla, Fred
Breining and Gary Lavelle.

Pity the poor» Padres. Despite
what would appear to be a team
built around a solid score, San
Diego will probably finish last in
the National League West for 2
third straight year.

With such players as shortsﬁ

Gary Templeton (the trade with
Ozzie Smith finally. went through),
outfielders Gene Richards, Joe
Lefebvre and.Sixto Lezcano, along
with catcher Terry Kennedy, the
Padres should be a better team.
Should be, but they are lacking one
important thing—they don't have
any pitching.

Chris Welsh and Rick Wise are
the best, but they are average at
best. After that, manager Dick Wil-
liams has to chose among a big
rookie crop. The same is true of the
bullpen.

Rounding out the squad, Luigi“

Salazar will be at third, Juan
Bonilla will hold down second and
Randy Bass will work at first.

priority remains a center, and the
number one center remains Clair-
ton’s Lloyd Moore. Chipman is
still unsure where he stands wi.

Moore, so he is busy recruifing

. other big men such as Keith Wes-

son of Ohio and Keith Armstrong
of Michigan. '

Moore has announced, however,
that he will make his decision
oefore the Roundball game sched-
uled for April 2.

Pitt's only recruit so far is Matt
Miklasevich, a 6-6 power forward,
while transfer Herb Lake, a 6-6
guard-forward, will be eligible
next year. Lake, a sophomore from
Youngstown, Ohio, transferred
from the University of \N1scons1n.

Besong w ins
award...

Pitt gymnast Bob Besong is a co-
winner of the Beaver County Hall
of Fame Dick Kadis Award. Along
with IUP basketball player Sam
Scott, Besong got the award, given
annually to the top Beaver County
high school graduate completing
his college career.

The award will be presented at a
banquet in Hopewell April 4,:

jhere 10 men will be muutfted into
the Hall, including Joe Namath.

A LaMonde, Latch-

owichz hope to

The Pitt baseball team came otii 1

of sunny Florida with an 0-6
record. A good reason for the
Panthers‘ poor showing is the fact
that two of their star pitchers, who
would have been seniors this year,
opted to try their fortunes in the
pros.

_ So far, the decision of Allen
Lachowichz and Larry LaMonde
seems to be paying off.

LaMonde, a 21st round draft
pick of the Pittsburgh Pirates, is
looking to move up in the Bucs’
minor lCdgUCb. .lllC' I'C'2i3Ull [Ur
LaMonde’s optimism is the rav-
ings that his knuckleball~" drew
from Pirate scouts last year.-

Lachowichz, meanwhile, wask

first round draft pick of the Texas
Rangers. After some early season
arm touble, created by the Rangers’
attempt to change Lachowichz’s
motion, Lachowichz settled back
into his old Pitt form. That
included a 90 mile an hour fastball
and wins.

continued from page eleven

five seconds off her best time by
finishing second with a time of
4:21.74. Besides gaining All-
America honors, the time was also
a new school record.

The 200-yard medley relay team

’{.)f Laura Barber, Diana Firth,

Nancy Henry and Val Murphy fin-
ished 15th with a time of 1:50.50.
Even though this relay didn’t earn
All-America honors, the time was
the best the relay swam all year and
gave Pitt eighth place at the end of
Thursday’s competition.

Ujevich opened Friday's action
by finishing seventh in the 200-
yard individual medley with a time
of 2:05.54 and came right back to
swim in the 50-yard freestyle,
which Belowich considered “a very
difficult double” to finish l6th in a
tremendous time of 24.11.

Co-captain Nancy Henry swam

‘.._,her best time all year in the 200-

" gfard butterfly (2:06.4 l ), which gave

- Vffisiier 13th place. The 800-yard free-

style relay of Jackson, Firth, Heon
and Ujevich gained All-America
honors and set a new school. record
by finishing sixth with a time of
7:33.63.

When the last day of competition
began, the Lady Panthers found
themselves in a fight for eighth-
place with the University of Geor-
gia, a fight which Belowich
referred to as “Sugar Bowl revis-
ited.” The Lady Bulldogs had a I3-
point lead going into Saturday's
competition, but Pitt was ready for
a challenge.

Jackson and Ujevich combined
in the 100-yard freestyle to cut the
Georgia lead to ten points by fin-

’§’ishing third and eighth respec-

tively, with Jackson’s time of 50.30
setting a school record. Georgia
regained eighth-place by finishing
fifth in the 200-yard backstroke,
but Ujevich came back to set a
school record in the I00-yard indi-
vidual medleyby finishingfourth
with a time of 58.62. -
Heon swam an outstanding race
in the I650-yard freestyle, consider-
ing the circumstances she faced.
Since she didn't swim in the event
in the Easterns due to illness, she
was seeded last which put her in the
slower of the two final heats. There
was no qualifying round for the
event.
“She had to win the event in the
2‘-nriiing,” Belowich said. “She
had to be faster than the heat she
was in."
Despite being in the slower heat,

Heon broke yet another school
record by finishing fourth with a
time of 16:38.77. Heon also broke
the 1000-yard freestyle mark by
swimming that split with a time of
9:58.44.

Georgia still had a 192-188 mar-
gin for eighth-place over Pitt going
into the final event—-the 400-yard
freestyle relay. Terrell opened- the
first leg of the relay with a lifetime-
best split of 52.5, which gave the
Lady Panthers third-place in the
race. Belowich switched positions
in the second and third, with Uje-
vich swimming second, Henry
third. 7

Even though Pitt dropped off to
fifth-place, the Lady Panthers still
had Jackson t() swim the final leg.
Jackson swam her split in 49.3, giv-
ing the Lady Panthers second-
place in the race and a school
record of 3:25.88 to give Pitt the
eighth-place finish.

Overall, six Lady Panther
swimmers earned All-America
honors, including Jackson, who
gained her fourth consecutive All-
America honor. Jackson also broke
Stetler’s record for most All-
America events with 20.

“It was an outstanding finish to
an outstanding year, ' Belowich
said.

The best year ever for the Pitt
Lady Panther swim team.

Sophomore Se Heon played a big part in Pitt’s eighth plac tii‘isat I
the AIAW National swimming and diving championshipsat the University of Texas.

swimming took a lot of back-

ground. Carter’s quick accelera-
UOII In swimming involved les-

«sions from-both his mom and
school coach, as well as double .

workouts daily—one at school and

one at the YMCA. -
During his sophomore year at

Shaler High School, Carter began

his AAU training at Pitt. Carter _

remembers Lewis as a tough coach
back then.

“He was a killer at first,” said 1

Carter. “He’d have you swimming

thousands of yards. He's gotten A

more flexible now and more under-

' standing of what each individual

should be practicing on the
team. He knows exactly who can or
can’t take whatever he gives at a
practice. This specialization is pay-
ing off for everybody on the team,
especiallv right now.” _ I

For Carter, it’s been a long hard
senior year.iWhen he is not swim-
ming, doing school work or inter-
viewing for a job, you’ll probably
find him fast asleep. His dreams of
graduation and national qualifica-
tion are coming true at the same
time, but neither without the kind

\ of dedication that has ranked him

not just as one of the fastest free-
stylers at Pitt, but one of the best in
the entire nation.
. Carter has earned the respect and
friendships that the Pitt swim team
given him. He describes his best
times in terms of swimming expe-
riences. “I know I'll miss every-
thing about. the team. We are our

own fraternity so to speak. I really,

have enjoyed it here at Pitt. I’m
going to need a very active and
competitive job when I graduate.
Competing with and against
friends has taught me a lot that I

can apply to my Econ major. With-
out swimming, I’m going to have
to buy some good weights anda
new pair of sneakers with my first
paycheck. I know I’ll still snap
awake at 6 a.m. instinctively for
practice and actually miss not hav-
ing to go. It’s been a rewarding four‘
years.”

Carter and the rest of the team
will return from Milwaulkee on
Sunday after three days of the
nationally televised national
swimming and diving champion-
ships. For Carter, the Champion-
ships marks the end of his
competitive swimming career,
since professional -swimming
doesn’t exist. Carter and his seven
teammates, which includes three
freshmen, have made it to the
SuperBowl of swimming—the
NCAA Division I National
Championships.

By AMIN GHOSSEIN

The NCAA tournament started
with 48 teams, all of whom had
visions of romping on Bourbon
Street for one glorious week and
then high stepping it into the
Superdome for the right to be
called the best basketball team in
A g e nation.

 Now, after endless fastbreaks,

slam dunks, jumpers, three-point
plays, controversial calls and
rebounds, the Four have come. The
Four, who, for the next week will
be the subject of a plethora of
attention, are upon us. They are
the survivors; they are Houston,
G'eorgetown, North Carolina and
Louisville.

In so "many ways, this tourna-
ment has the sameness of previous
ones. There was
team, Houston, like UNC Char-
lotte, like Penn. Guy Lewis’ Hous-
ton Cougars have slipped on the
glass slipper this year. i

 Then there was the agony of

. aul. Gone was Mark Aguirre,
the team’s superstar who some said
robbed the team of their cohesive-
ness, but what remained was the
same old sitory—the failure to win a
game in the tournament. For the
third straight year, the highly-
touted, highly-talented DePaul
Blue Demons went down. This
time the Boston College Golden
Eagles, who some felt shouldn’t
have even made the tourney, were
Del’aul’s conquerors.

Or rather, was l)el’aul its own

conqueror? ,
Boston College showed the crit-

ics that yes, they belonged, by mak-

ing it all the way to the Midwest

regional only to lose to Houston.

dihe Midwest Regional brought

I e most unanticipated final of the
whole tournament. With teams
like Missouri, Kansas State,
DePau1 and Arkansas, in that
regional, Houston and Boston Col-
lege, were given little chance.
Remember Cinderella, however.

‘Houston sure will. .

While Houston's path to the
Final Four surprised most, George-
town, North Carolina, and Louis-
ville’s presence in New Orleans is
hardly eyebrow raising. '

Final Four Set for Battle for Supremecy  

—Pa‘ge‘ l7 3'

A ‘Orleans, they blitzkrieged their

way there. No team has looked
more awesome than Georgetown.
They weren't challenged in the
tournament. Pat Ewing might
have a little to do with that. The
freshman intimidator has been a
one man wrecking crew in the mid-
dle _of the lane, blocking shots,
intimidating would-be chal-

; lengers, forcing players to change

their shots when they get near him.

Forcing teams to change their
entire game plans. Of.course, a cer-
tain guard by the name of Sleepy
Floyd helps too.

Louisville might be considered a
slight surprise. Lousiville'.s season
had not been filled with tremen-
dous wins, in fact, at one point in
the season, the Cardinals weren't
even sure to make it to the tourna-
ment.

DennyCrum's team is one of the
most talented in the country, buf it

end of the season--the results
speak for themselves. _

Then there is the North Carolina
Tar Heels. Anything less than a
trip to New Orleans would have
been a disappointment for this
team. Their starting five is the best
in the country. They are smart,
they are explosive, they are physi-
cal, they are seemingly perfect.
They are the team you love to hate,
the Dallas (lowboys of college
basketball.

They don’t seem to‘sweat. They
might have taken a had shot during
the tournament but then again,
they might not have. Dean Smith’s
team is so sound, so heady and oh
so talented. Forward James Worthy
is an awesome offensive weapon,
but when you have San] Perkins on
your team, Worthy’s production
falters in the name of team play.
Freshman guard Michael Jordan
isn’t too shabby, either.
