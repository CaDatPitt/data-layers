_ When Rachel Mayer moved to Pittsburgh
from Chicago, she had to make new
friends, discover a new city and start class-
es at a new school. The last thing she
wanted to worry about was finding a place
to live. ‘

"When I was accepted, Pitt told me I
would not have housing. They wouldn't
send me classified ads from the local
papers. They told me there was no formal
graduate housing and I would have to
come into the Office of Commuter Services

and go through the lists of apartments,”
said Mayer, a graduate student in the

School of Communication.

New local bookstore competes for student text business

By Mark Gordon
Staff Writer

A war between book stores on Pitt’s
campus has begun as The Campus
Bookstore opened its doors, attempting
to give students a financial break on the
ever-increasing cost of books.

The new store on Forbes Avenue
opened in November and is owned and
operated by three local business people.
“We are trying to give students an alter-

native to the higher-priced university
bookstore by offering new and
improved services,” said Vincent
Meinert, one of the store’s owners.

Meinert added that, “lbecausel our
markup is less and we have less employ-
ees, our books are considerably cheap-
er.” He said some books can be bought
at $2 —$3 cheaper than the University
Book Center, located on Fifth Avenue
eight blocks away.

Director of the University Book Center

Mary Bonach disputes the claim that the
new store has cheaper prices. “We have
students who have come in and found
our prices to be the same,” she said.

Karen Tobkes, a first-year Pitt student,
said she did some of her shopping at the
new book store, but was not over-
whelmed. “I think the prices are about
the same elsewhere,” she said.

Besides offering cheaper prices,
Meinert said his store enables students to
save time because there are less lines to

wait on, and students do not have to
wander around to find their books. They
can call in advance and place orders by
telephone or drop off their course sched-
ules and have the staff pull the books.
The new store has run into some prob-
lems when stocking the books because

the university will not give out the list of,

books that professors require their stu-
dents to read. Meinert and his partners,

IFC plans to combat negative image on campus

By Cameron Harvey
Staﬂ Writer
Combating the negative

stereotyping that has plagued
the Greek system in the past
and informing the student pop-
ulation of the positive aspects of
the Greek system will be priori-
ty tasks for the Inter-Fratemity
Council this year, members
announced at last night's meet-
ing.

“We encourage people to
come out and to see for them-
selves what we’re all about,”
said Matt Friedman, the vice
president for administration.
“There’s a lot of Greek bashing,
but no one seems to realize
how much we really do.”

“We do 100 positive things for
every one negative  we just
get a lot of Greek bashing from
people who don’t know much
about it,” said Brian Rifkin, pres-
ident of the IFC.

While none of the new mem-

bers said they want to “rock the
boat,” all said they agree that a
more united Greek system is in
the works.

“We want to stop isolation-
ism,” said Friedman. “All that
serves to do is to defeat the
Greek system.”

“What people don’t realize is
that we are the biggest govern-
ing organization on campus. We
do have social events but we do
a lot [of charitable events] too,”
Rifkin said.

According to Andy Demming,
the vice president for recruiting,
over $100,000 was raised last
year for charities. Of that, over
$2,000 went to the Make-a-Wish
Foundation, benefiting terminal-
ly ill children.

Other Greek events include
blood drives, visits to the United
Cerebal Palsy in Oakland and
clean up the community pro-
grams.

All of the new members said
they agree that the new board

members and positions should
help make the fraternity system
even better. “They’re basically
the same positions, just spread
out more evenly,” Demming
said.

“Last year some of the posi-
tions were lopsided,” said
Friedman.

“The internal vice president
was in charge of rushing and
the socials. Now it is more clear-
ly defined. The power is more
spread out.”

According to J.J. Seiler, the
vice president for member edu-
cation, other efforts to do this
come with the Greek 101
events. Here, members of all of
the fraternities are mixed
together for one day of learning
about the Greek system.

Typically lectures include
subjects such as rape preven-
tion and the Liquor Control
Board. “It’s a chance to mix
together with different fraterni-
ties and to meet new people.”

Rifkin said he disagrees with
the people who don’t think that
the fraternity life is for them.
“There is a fratemity for every-
one.”

With over 20 fraternities on
carnpué, Friedman said he
believes that the Greek system
can “cater to everyone.”

“You really learn social and
business interaction. There’s no
way that you can’t get some-
thing out of it,’ said Demming.
“I can go anywhere in the world
and have a friend in someone if
they’re from my fraternity, or
just in the fraternity system in
general.”

“It really prepares you for the
future, but you only get out of it
what you put into it,” Seiler
said.

With Rush Week starting
tomorrow, Rifkin said he sug-
gests to everyone that they
“come out and see all of the
fraternities. See what it’s all
about.”

Meinert added, “We are

Watters and his staff are
working with the housing
department for the acquisition
of this building.

Watters said that the two
departments are jointly buying
the building to see if further
acquisitions of this type will be
beneficial to the university
housing issue.

They are also doing it to
“enhance their relationship
through joint operations,” said

This is the first building
acquired through this new rela-
tionship.

The building is called Center
Plaza and is located on Center
Avenue.

“It is already located along a
shuttle route and is just a 10-
minute walk to campus,” said
Waters.

The apartments are large and
spacious with as much as 1,600
square feet per unit.

Two and-three bedroom

      

bathrooms will be available to
rent. Watters says the units will
also have hookups for laundry
and individually controlled air
conditioning and heating units.

Watters says the Office of
Property Management is plan-
ning on furnishing the units.
“The option will be there if stu-
dents want to live in a real
classy place.”

He said there are several fur-
niture rental companies in the
Pittsburgh area.

as little as one month and as
long as 11 months,” said
Watters, “We want to be as ﬂex-

terms.” The units will be made
ﬂexible for visiting scholars and
faculty as well.

nied him on the retreat.

Board member Heath Golden, who
summed up the weekend as “productive,”
said the board accomplished its goal: get a
clear idea of what it wants to get done this
term.

“Everyone now has a much better idea
of where we’re going,” Golden ‘said.

“Now we can combine all
resources,” he said.

New SGB member Elizabeth Mania said
the retreat helped increase unity among
the new board members.

“We accomplished a lot of goal—setting
and got motivated for projects,” Mania
said. “[The retreat] also helped us to

0111'

' bounce back from the campaign  it really

helped to reinforce the similarities on the
board.” .
Mania, who attended last year’s week-

end—long retreat as a member‘ of the 1993
Allocations Committee, also said this year’s
one-night retreat was more productive
than the previous year's.

“We were definitely able to get done
what we needed to in the amount of time
we had. It was better than the two-day
retreat last year.”

Pasquale said the retreat’s location was
moved from the Courtyard Marriott to the
Holiday Inn-Airport due to uncertainties
about accommodations, but the exact cost
of the retreat will not be known until later
this week. _ '

Despite its change in location, however,
Pasquale said the retreat went as well as
he had hoped.

“It accomplished what I wanted’ it to,”
he said.

“I have a clear understanding where
these people want to go  tl1ey’re focused

on staying within a few areas instead of
spreading themselves too thin.”

Pasquale said the new board will con-
centrate on following through with the
goals they set last weekend.

“I expect them to take seriously their
goals. Some things have more stringent
deadlines than others,” he said. “I also
expect them to help me stay more
informed.” ’

“I need to know what’s going on,” he
said. A A

Additionally, Pasquale confirmed that he
will recommend Elizabeth Mania for presi-
dent pro tempore and Heath Golden for
business manager at Thursdays SGB meet-
ing where the recommendations will be
voted on by the board. —

The Thursday meeting will be held in
639 of the William Pitt Union at 7:30 p.m..
The meeting is open to the public.

Continued from page I
graduate students who may be
away from home for the first
time because they are younger
and they need a more con-
trolled and supportive living
environment.”

The housing department
operates one on-campus gradu-
ate housing facility, compared
to the 18 on—campus undergrad-
uate residence facilities — six of
which are fraternity houses.

The graduate facility is the
Delta Sigma Delta fraternity
which houses about 25 dental
graduate students. It is located
next to Sutherland Hall near the

other university—owned fraterni-

ty houses.

“Space is tight on an urban
campus with limited bound-
aries,” said Hopkins. “We have
-to be a lot more creative in
terms of expanding buildings
and being more efficient. The
challenge to the university is
how to be more creative and
efficient  space is a problem,
but it will be solved,” he said.

Associate Vice Chancellor for
Business John DeVitto said
there is a concern for graduate
student housing. There is one
building, Ruskin Hall, reserved
solely for graduate students.

“We really have a lack of
undergraduate housing. We’re
trying to accommodate all that
we can,” he said. “They [tinder-

graduates] would have more
trouble living independently off
campus.”

Sutherland Hall created 10
percent more undergraduate
housing when it was built, but
Hopkins said Pitt still continues
to have a shortage of beds.

“There is a strong argument for
why we give first priority to
undergraduate- housing needs,”
he said.

The university has plans to
implement a housing program
that will eventually increase
graduate-student housing,
DeVitto said. Right now, it is in
the process of renovating the
existing housing facilities, such
as Schenley Quad and the
Towers.

“We are scheduled to have
increased student housing,
including graduate housing, by
the year 2000,” DeVitto said.

The program looks at the total
housing picture including mar-
ried, visiting and young faculty
accommodations. DeVitto said
he doesn’t know how much it

’will cost, but “we’ll keep it as

cost effective as we can.”

Mayer found a one bedroom
apartment in Shadyside for $425
a month plus utilities. "'It’s hard
to find a safe area for a female
to live on her own safely for
under $380 a month,” said
Mayer.

housing program] is planned
out, done well and that we have
students to occupy it. The prob-
lem is that people really don’t
want to live on campus, don’t
want to live in a structured envi-
ronment as they get older,” said
DeVitto. .

Some of the graduate schools
offer assistance in finding hous-
ing upon acceptance into that
school. The School of Law
prints up an apartment-sharing
list every year to help students
find accommodations and
roommates.

Sharon Simpson, the admis-
sions secretary for the Pitt
School of Law, said that “when
we send the acceptance letter,
we ask them to send back their
name, address, phone number
and undergraduate school, if
they decide to attend.” Over the
summer, they compile a list of
people who plan on coming
and mail it out.

“It’s a self-help type of list,”
Simpson said. “They have to
find their own apartments, but
it's a kind of way to get people
together to find roommates.”

“The communication depart-
ment was no help. When I
called to ask about housing, the
secretary thought I was crazy,”
said Mayer. She said they just

told her to call Commuter
Services.
The Graduate and

Professional Student Association
is currently working to form a
task force to address the issue
of university—owned graduate
student housing.

They say their plan “is to
demand a large portion of the

off-campus, ‘university-run
apartments be reserved for
graduate students,” said student
advocate Pia Basudev, in a
memo addressing the issue at
their last meeting.

However, what many stu-
dents may not know is that
there are university—owned
apartments available to gradu-
ate students.

According to Jim Watters of
the Department of Property
Management, “the university
owns 477 apartment units in
North and South Oakland and
Shadyside,” Watters said. “Three
hundred twenty-seven of the
residents of those units are
graduate students, 153 are
undergraduate students and the
balance are non-students. They
may be staff, faculty or city resi-
dents,” he said.

The university does not evict
existing city residents of the
buildings they acquire. Watters
said, “the philosophy of the uni-
versity" is that, when we pur-
chase apartment units, we do
not want to have conﬂicts with
existing non—students. So the
university allows current tenants
to remain. After they leave, then
the university rents them [those
units] out to students. We have
some residents who have lived
in university—owned buildings
for 20 years.”

The university—owned build-
ings are secured and safe. They
cost significantly less than some
local realtors charge for rent.
McKinney 8: Ringham, a local
reality company, charges $915 a
month for a two-bedroom, two-
bathroom apartment in North

Oakland. Watters said that a
university—owned two-bedroom,
two-bathroom apartment is
about $350 less. These figures
do not take room size into
account.

“We have raised the standard
of the buildings to assure stu-
dents a safe place to live,” said
Watters. “They lthe buildings]
provide quality living space for
these kids.”

The university does not pro-
vide funding for renovations.
Waters said the Office of
Property Management is consid-
ered an auxiliary enterprise.

“The character of an auxiliary
enterprise is that they sustain
themselves from self-generated
revenues.” Watters explained
that the Office of Property
Management pools the
resources of all the units which
enables them to expand the sys-
tem further. The Office of
Property Management at Pitt is
not out to make a profit on the
units it owns.

“The system has to sustain
itself; pricing has to be real. We
reinvest in property, not take
out money as profit,” Watters
said.

Currently, the university is in
the process of closing a deal to
buy a 68—unit apartment build-
ing on Center Avenue, Center
Plaza Apartments. The building
has “really large, spacious units.
There are two- and three-bed-
room units with one and two
baths. Full kitchens, hookups
for laundry and the heat and air-

conditioning are individually‘

controlled in each apartment,”

said Watters.

Watters understands the need
to provide additional graduate
housing and he said that as
housing becomes available, the
university will quickly move to
offer it to graduate students and
upperclass students.

Center Plaza will be a fur-
nished facility, said Watters. “It
is already right along the shuttle
route, and it’s a ten-minute walk
to campus.”

The Department of Housing is
working with the Department of
Property Management to pur-
chase Center Plaza. The two
departments are “enhancing
their relationship through joint
operations,” Watters said.

This is the first building the
two departments are working
together on. They “plan on
looking into whether it makes
senseito continue [working
togetherl in other acquisitions,”
said Watters.

Leases for Center Plaza will
be offered in full and short
terms. There will be short-term
leases available for visiting
scholars and faculty.“Could be
as little as one month or as long
as 11 months,” Watters said.
“We are operating the building
with enhanced ﬂexibility as far
as lease terms go.”

According to Watters, the
Office of Property Management
just spent $700,000 in renova-
tions for Ruskin Hall in the past
year. There are plans to spend
$200,000 on renovations in the
South Oakland area.

Ruskin Hall got brand new
windows this fall. Watters said
they built :1 “tot lot” for children
of families living in the apart-
ments in South Oakland to have
a safe place to play. They put in

‘ laundry facilities as well.

In the university-owned
Forbes/Craig building, they are
renovating the lobby and
including outdoor patio areas.
There are also children’s pro-
grams offered in that building.

go next door to the Lutheran
Center to play.

The Office of Property
Management has someone act
as a liaison between them and
the tenants. They take cus-
tomer- satisfaction polls yearly
to keep their tenants satisfied.

“Some foreign students come
here and immediately know
which building they want to live
in because word gets back to
them in their native countries,”
said Watters. “They choose
buildings depending on what
style of living they want,” he
said.

“Our mission is not to make a
profit, our mission is to make
satisfied customers,” Watters
said-

Mayer didn’t know about the
Office of Property Management.

“'lt’s shocking about the prop-
erty management,” she said. “I
don’t think many people know
about it.” No one ever told her
about it. “Housing is a major

problem here."

"The last thing I wanted to
worry about was finding a place
to live.”

The Office of Property
Management offers housing
with all types of living arrange-
ments.

“Ninety—one of the 477 units
are actually family households.
They are married couples with
children,” Watters said.

Housing is acquired as it
becomes available, and it could
extend into Shadyside or
Squirrel Hill. “It is an incremen-
tal approach which has enabled
us to maintain a financial profile
—— to have them [housing units]
operate well,” Watters said.

Mayer said she considers her-
self lucky. Within three days she
found an apartment in
Shadyside. In the end, all of the
university-owned apartments
were already filled. “I found
mine through the classifieds in
the Pittsburgh Post Gazette.”

The Office of Property Management, in conjunction
with the Department of Housing, plans to purchase a
68—unit apartment building named Center Plaza some-
time this month. These apartments, which will be
made available for students to rent, are along the shut-
tle route and are 10-minute walk from campus. The
purchase of this building brings to light an important
problem facing Pitt graduate students. There is only
one on—campus building that houses graduate stu-
dents, the Sigma Delta Fraternity. However, this only
houses 2S students, all from the School of Dental
Science. This is in comparison to the 18 buildings
which house undergraduate students.

Although they are a smaller portion of the student
population, graduate students pay higher tuition. They
also serve the university as teaching assistants. With
the important contributions they make, their concerns
merit attention. Because they often come from other
areas of the country, they need to be informed about
the housing options as soon as possible. _

Because Property Management has been gradually
obtaining housing for graduate students and the
Department of Housing is responsible for on-campus
housing, the two should work together to see that
graduate students who want on-campus housing
receive it. The Graduate and Professional Student
Association is working to form a task force to look
into the subject of graduate student housing.

If the housing and property management offices can-
not provide housing right away for all graduate stu-
dents, they could at least provide information about
apartments in the area and a guide to the neighbor-
hoods of Pittsburgh. One student from Chicago
received no information other than a packet on how
to sign a lease when she requested information. The
Pitt Law School tries to help their new students find
roommates in a “self-help type of list.” But the
Graduate and Professional Student Association would
like them to do more, in the form of “a large portion
of the off-campus [housing] be reserved for graduate
- students.”

It is important that all who are eligible for university
housing be made aware that the option exists for
them. According to Jim Watters of the Office of
Property Management, university owned, off-campus
housing costs about $550 less per month to rent. The
cost of housing is a large consideration in a student’s
life, and if the university can make it available at lower
cost, they should do so. Finally, the efforts to acquire
more housing must be intensified. Graduate students
are an essential element to the campus and are enti-
tled to fair treatment by the university. Affordable, safe
housing only enhances the educational enviroment, a
goal that should always be a priority for the university.

Columnist examines major issuesfor 1994

With 1994 being only several
days old, I thought it would be
interesting to look at some of
the leading stories of the new
year. With Clinton in office a
year and having passed no leg-
islation on health care or wel-
fare reform, he is sure to want
to focus on his domestic agen-
da. However, international
events will almost certainly
consume more of Clinton’s
time than he would like. With
that in mind, the biggest issues
of 1994 are as follows:

1. With Les Aspin ﬁnally boot-
ed and Strobe T albott given the
post of Deputy Secretary of
State (in reality he will be the
de facto head of state), the
president’s foreign policy team
can only improve over ‘95.

2. With the mini-revolution in
October, the rise of Vladimir V.
Zhirinovsky in December and
an economy in shambles, 1993
was rough for Boris Yeltsin,
especially since he is trying to
be the next dictator. This
despite the fact that he con-
stantly tells the West he favors
“democracy” and the West con-
tinues to be gullible enough to
believe him. Russia has a 1,500

year history of having an
authoritarian government, and
the West isn’t about to change
them now. Don’t look for
Yeltsin to hold presidential
elections on June 12. With the
economy the way that it is, on
top of soaring crime rates, he
probably couldn’t win.

3. Clinton must stop waftling
and get China’s support for a

Tony
Dickensheets

tougher stance against the
regime in Pyongyang. If North
Korea becomes a nuclear state,
the idea of non-proliferation is
dead (if it isn’t already) and,
more importantly, Japan will
most likely rearm, thus destabi-
lizing East and Southeast Asia.

4. Clearly the success of
Clinton’s presidency rides on
whether he passes health care
reform. Some sort of legislation
will most likely pass, although
it won’t be the universal cover-
age that the Clintons want. This
country needs to work on cost-

containment and assuring
access to health care. Health
care is not a right, it is a privi-
lege earned through work, not
government handouts.

5. Look for the president and
the Democratically-controlled
Congress to keep focusing on
gun control, thereby deceiving
the American people and
allowing criminals to continue
to rule the streets of America.
When will the people grow
tired of the bleeding hearts cry-
ing more for criminals than vic-
tims? Mandatory sentences for
violent offenders and capital
punishment for murderers is
the ONLY thing that will turn
the tide on crime.

6. The U.S. government spends
$11 billion a year on providing
services (i.e., health care, edu-
cation, etc.) to illegal aliens.
Clearly this nation needs legal
immigrants, but we cannot
continue supporting those who
enter our nation illegally. Just
because we are a nation of
immigrants doesn’t mean that
we are obligated toropen our
borders to everyone. No other
country has a more lenient
immigration policy than the

WANTED: Poet with a sharp eye for beauty

Where have the poets gone? It was like one
morning I woke up and no one was there to
explain the morning to me in pretty words. They
slipped out the back door. All the poets are
either songwriters or coffee house junkies. But
these creations of pop culture, are they worthy

to start somewhere, right? These literary maga-
zines have some good poetical pieces in them,
but no one stands out as superior.

The thing is, no one wants to be a poet any-
more. Everyone wants to be a lawyer or a doc-
tor. In the words of Robin Williams (Dead Poets

of the title “poet”?

Songwriters now are so preoccu-
pied with speaking out against soci-
ety that most of them have lost their
poetry. I’m a bit biased, but Bono of

and necessary to sustain life. But
poetry, poetry is what we live for.”
Maybe so, but no one seems to
care. People have dabbled with

U2 comes to mind for a pretty good
mix of poetry and social responsibility. Natalie
Merchant (10,000 Maniacs), Speech (Arrested
Development), Peter Gabriel and yes, Eddie
Vedder (Pearl Jam), in my view, could be classi-
fied as poetical. But are they true poets?

I don’t know. Poets seemed to have gotten
themselves lost in the shuffle of the late 20th
century almost as much as every other true icon.
Are we to have no more Robert Frosts, no more
Walt Whitmans? _

Of course, there are amateurs, and we 2111 have

poetry, but no one dares to be seri-
ous about it.. We are human beings; intellect
and a sharp eye for beauty are what makes us
different from dogs, trees or a picturesque
scene. It is our job to describe these wonders in
words of beauty and awe.

Let me remind you, in the words of Mr. Robert
Frost, “...and I, I took the one [road] less trav-
elled by, and that has made all the difference.”
Do you dare? All right, now that I’ve waxed
philosophic, get back to that chemistry.

Penny shines in Magic route

Hardaway nets 28 in Magic win; Hornacek's 31 downs Celts

By Jason Brame
Sports Editor

It wasn’t billed as The Present vs The Future
and it didn’t receive the hype that other regular
season games do, but last nights match-up in the
Orlando Arena made it seem pretty obvious that
the Orlando Magic wanted to send a big message
to the teams in the NBA.

So before a national television audience, the
Atlantic Division’s second—place team rode a 28-
point explosion by rookie guard Anfernee
Hardaway to their fourth straight win with a 115-
100 decision over the Houston Rockets.

“[Beating the Rockets] was something we want-
ed to prove to the league,” Hardaway said. “We
feel we don’t have the respect around the league
that other teams do. If we have to keep beating
teams above us to earn respect, we’re going to do
that.”

Hardaway’s production matched stand-out cen-
ter Shaquille O'Neal's for game-high honors. The
point guard said that it was the Rockets‘ high
intensity that fueled the Magic's high octane per-
formance. -

“We tried to match the intensity because with-
out [starting guard] Vern Maxwell, [back-up]
Mario Elie and the rest of the Rockets, were gong
to play extra hard.”

Hardaway, who also had six assists, said that a
little more selfishness has helped his scoring

increase.

“One of my biggest mistakes is over-passing
but that's just my unselfishness,” he said. “I was
just trying to draw the foul, but now I’m going to
the hoop more.”

Rocket center Hakeem Olajuwon continued his
run at the NBA's Most Valuable Player with a 26-
point game against O‘Neal.

Donald Royal notched 16 points for the Magic
with 33 points off the bench. Robert Horry,
Houston's stand-out forward, recorded 15 points
and six steals in 57 minutes.

The game marked the first time that Tree
Rollins, an assistant under Magic head coach
Brian Hill and former Atlanta Hawk stand-out,
saw action in an NBA game since Game 7 of
1993's Western Conference Semi-finals when he,
ironically, played for the Rockets. Rollins played
eight minutes and finished with two points, an
assist and one steal. He was given a huge cheer
when he entered the game in the first half.

The center was recently signed to a 10-day con-
tract to compensate for the loss of Greg Kite,
whom the Magic placed on the injured-reserve
list.

In other games: Jeff Homacek scored 31
points as the Philadelphia 76ers outlasted the
reeling Boston Celtics 99-94 last night at the
Spectrum in Philadelphia. Shawn Bradley scored
eight points on three-of-11 shooting as the Sixers
survived a 13-0 run to beat the Celtics.

The aggressive defense

“Getting more posses-

Steeler defensive back D. J. Johnson’s kick to
Tim Barnett’s head was a move of rare stupidi-
ty. It also forced Pittsburgh into an unusual
number of zone defenses, just begging to be
torn apart by Joe Montana.

At least ]ohnson’s mistake was made in the
heat of the moment. Some sports geniuses (of
which I remain one) are left trying to explain
how a team they picked to go to the Super
 Bowl was ejected from the playoffs so quickly.

only 66 yards on 25 carries (2.6 yards per
carry). At least Foster is expected to be healthy
by training camp.

If only the Steeler wide receivers could learn
how to hold on to the football by then. Ernie
Mills was outstanding, with four receptions for
60 yards and a touchdown, but he disappeared
far too often during the regular season.

Jeff Graham made his share of big plays. He
also dropped a key pass as he had done all sea-
son. This time it was the play before the
blocked punt. If Graham holds on, there is no
reason to kick the ball away.

The very next series, it was Dwight Stone’s
turn to min what had been a good day for him

point of view. The punting unit
has been the worst culprit all
season. During the season, they
could not cover kicks. Against
Kansas City, they blew it by not
getting the punt off.

In addition, the Steelers have

problem if a certain team had coughed up the
extra few bucks to sign free agent Eric Martin
last off—season.

The wide receiver problem leads into the
other flaw in the Steeler offense — no deep
passing game. In addition to the problems at
the receiving end, Neil O’Donnell has struggled
to get the ball deep all year. Burners like Mills
and Stone are much less effective with a quar-
terback who can’t hit the bomb.

O’Donnell was great on Saturday, the first ray
of hope all year that he might be worth what
the Steelers are paying him. Whether
or not it was a sore arm that ham-
pered his deep passing, O’Donnell
must start hitting on long passes to

be a top quarterback, the kind of
passer that can take Pittsburgh to the
top.

Linebacker Kevin Greene said the
team has a whole off-season to let
the loss “sink in.” Add correcting a
few ongoing problems to that list of
things to do.

The attack on Kerrigan has been
compared to the stabbing of tennis
star Monica Seles, the No. 1 player in
the world, last year. The man who
attacked-Seles said he was a fan of
Stefﬁ Graf, who was second to Seles,
and wanted his favorite to regain her
top ranking. A few months later, his
wish came true. Even more sicken-
ing than the attack is the fact that the
man spent no time in jail.

Basically, a fan decided to inter-
vene on behalf of his favorite athlete
with violence, and he got his way.
That sends a scary message. Maybe
it is what Kerrigan’s attacker had in
mind. Maybe not. Whatever his
motives, Kerrigan’s addition to the
team shows that violent attacks will
not take rightful opportunities away

Women jump

By Jack Becker
Staff Writer

The Pitt wOmen’s basketball
team, off to its best start in thir-
teen years, won five out of six
games over winter break to
raise its record to 10-2 overall,
4-0 in the Big East, after
Saturday’s win against Miami.

The 1993-94 Lady Panthers
have jumped out faster than any
previous Pitt teams since the
1980-81 squad posted a similar
9-2 record through eleven
games, thanks to Jonna
Huemrich’s all—conference play
and a deep corps of guards.

“This is one of the best starts
we’ve had,” head coach Kirk
Bruce said.

With Huemrich averaging
21.1 points per game, the team
playing solid defense and play-
ers like Jill Colabrese and Jenine
Joyce taking turns scoring in the
twenties, Pitt has launched itself
in the direction of Big East con-
tender.

Bruce said he is hoping the
start will carry a snowball effect
through the rest of the year, but

Pitt took on Canisius in the
first game and cruised to an 80-
53 victory. Led by Huemrich’s
season-high 24 points and 11 of
its 13 players in the scoring col-
umn, Pitt advanced to the cham-
pionship round to meet Ball St.

The Lady Panthers survived
40 combined points from Ball
St.’s Dianne McConnell and
Alana Hancock, getting 20
points from Huemrich, 15 from
Thompson and 12 from senior
Erin Maloy. Maloy, now playing
without her cumbersome knee
brace, helped spark Pitt to a 79-
69 victory and the Pitt
Invitational championship.

“We were getting good contri-
butions from everybody. That’s
the kind Of thing we need to do
to win games,” Bruce said.

Huemrich was named MVP Of
the invitational. Bruce said
Huemrich was “almost embar-
rassed” by being named MVP
because she thought she could
have played better despite col-

tates a lot,” Bruce said. “She’s
like the Flash. She shows up
everywhere. That gets us
going.”

The 5-foot 2-inch junior has
played with a perpetual motion
style,‘ pressuring opposing
guards, forcing steals and push-
ing the ball upcourt.

i“T hat is one area of my game
that never leaves me,” Morton
said.

“The coaches [encourage] me.
I am quick and I can get steals.
Coach Bmce encourages me to
get it and go. Its something I
like to do and it blends in with
the team.”

Versatile shooting guard
Jenine _Joyce was another key
component Bruce pointed to in
the Pitt defense. The 5~foot-9—
inch junior from Pittsburgh has
been a swing defender, playing
against point guards and small
forwards. .

“Jenine Joyce has a lot of
quickness and long arms,”
Bruce said. “She’s got a lot of
stamina.”

\

Huemrich established herself
as one of the top players in the
Big East with her scoring and
rebounding (she is sixth in Pitt
history in both categories), but
she has also been among the
team leaders in steals (seventh
all—time). _

“If there is a bad pass, Jonna
is going to get it,” Bruce said.
“She’s like a vacuum cleaner. If
that ball is in her area, she’s got
her hands on it and we’re
gone?

Huemrich said she is working
hardeiion the defensive end
than she has in the past. Bruce
pointed to her example as
another reason for the team’s
improvement.

“Jonna has worked harder on

«defense this year than she ever

has lbeforel,” Bruce said. “Jonna
was [already] a great player 
she felt as though she needed to
step that part of her game up.
That’s a tribute to her. She con-
tinues to work. When you get
your star player going out and
busting her hump on defense,
you are going to get something

out of everybody else.”

Thou shalt Run

Bruce has stressed the transi-
tion game from day one of this
season. An offense that strug-
gled last season, scoring 65.7
points per game, is feeding off

’ the defense. Pitt has raised its
scoring average to 74 points per
game.

“We’d love to run even more
than we do,” Huemrich said.
“We have the players to do that,
too.”

Those players include a deep

bench and a strong group of J

guards that can push the attack.
Bruce said early on that one
reason Pitt would run more this
year is the ability of Morton and
rookie guard Jojo Guzman to
push the ball up the floor.

Guzman went down with a
season—ending knee injury in
the loss at Vanderbilt. Senior
Erin Maloy, a former starter at
the point who had been moved
to shooting guard, has recov-
ered enough from a preseason
knee injury to provide another
solid point guard.

Thou shalt not foul

One thing that Pitt has not
learned to avoid is fouling.
Huemrich and Morton both
pointed to that as the team’s
major problem on defense.

“Sometimes, we get into the
habit of fouling and fouling and
bailing out [opposing teamsl,”
Morton said. “We come together
and say that we’ve got to stop
bailing them out. We know we
can play good defense without
fouling.”

Huemrich said’ an aggressive,
defensive style is only partly to
blame for excessive fouling.

“Sometimes we just do stupid
things. Every team is going to
do that,” Huemrich said. “A lot
of it is being aggressive.”

PITT PRIDE: RESPONDING TOTHE NEEDS OFTHCOMMUNITY

UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH BLOOD DRIVES

_ J Chris PalmierolThe Pitt News
Jonna Huemrich has made a name for herself as a scorer,
but she has also been a key to Pitt's improved defense.

 

As we begin the new year, the region’s blood supply
has been crippled by harsh‘ weather conditions; there
could be no worse time for a blizzard than the week
following the extended holiday season. Nearly 900
donations were lost in just two days due to canceled
drives and donors’ appointments. o

Wrap-up
Contd from page 11

lecting 44 points, 19 rebounds,

three blocks and two assists.

“I don’t know how she
could’ve played better than she
did,” Bruce said. “She’s not try-
ing to win MVP. She’s just trying
to help us win. Jonna knows
what it takes.”

From there the Lady Panthers
hit the road to face two Big East
opponents, Boston College and
Syracuse.

Pitt won big again at BC, 82-
63, and received a boost from
Colabrese, who tallied 22 points
and three steals. Bruce said that
Colabrese’s 14 first-half points,
“set the tone for the rest of the
game.” I-Iuemrich continued her
sky—high play (23 points, four
steals).

The Lady Panthers then trav-
eled to Syracuse, if what they
had to go through in order to
play the game can be called
travel. Voyage, expedition or
trek might be more suitable
words.

Pitt got caught in “The
Blizzard of ‘94” trying to leave
Boston. Syracuse was covered
with what Bruce called “30
inches of snow.” The Syracuse

game was delayed from 7 p.m.

on Jan. 5 to 2 p.m. on Jan. 6.
“It’s real tough functioning

not knowing when you’re

gonna play the next game,”

Bruce said.

Getting from point A to point
B became the number one pri-
ority for Pitt.

“A 10-minute ride would take
half an hour. You couldn’t see
anything. It was really bad,”
Bruce said. “They call it ‘white-
out’ up there.”

The Lady Panthers made the
most of their predicament and
took advantage of what their
hotel had to offer. Some of the
players used the hotel pool and
the hotel stairmaster, and a
group of players even ran the
stairwell to get a cardiovascular
workout.

Then Pitt played the waiting
game.

Pitt did not even step onto the
Manley Field House ﬂoor until
the day of the game.

Bruce said that delaying the
game helped Pitt and hurt
Syracuse.

“It relaxed us a bit and put
pressure on them,” Bruce said.
“They over-prepared for us.”

Joyce shrugged off the frigid
weather outside and fired up a
career-high 26 points to lead Pitt
to a 71-61 victory and an unde-
feated Big East record. Junior
Carol Morton ignited the
defense by creating six steals.

Bruce could not choose
which victory was the most cru-
cial for his team but pointed to
the Big East wins as the keys.

“What we’ve done with these
three [Big East] wins is revenge
losses from last year.”

In 1992-93, Pitt lost on the
road at both Boston College and
Syracuse as well as a season-

ending loss to Villanova in the

Big East Tournament.

“A major factor in a team’s
season is winning games on the
road,” Bruce said.

So far Pitt is undefeated in the
Big East — all road wins.

Foul Shot: Rookie point
guard JoJo Guzman is out for
the entire season with a knee
injury. Guzman injured her
anterior cruciate ligament early
in the game against Vanderbilt.
Guzman is the second Pitt play-
er to be sidelined for the year.
Forward Julie Fornadel is also
out with the same injury.

from Olympic athletes.

-P.S. to the Kerrigan story.
Big-tirne props are due to 13-
year-old Michelle Kwan. She
finished second in the U.S.
championships and would
have gone if the exception
had not been made. The
youngster handled it with
grace, saying Kerrigan
deserved to be there.
Wouldn’t it be nice if Deion
Sanders, who is more than
twice as old as Kwan, had
even half of her class? (Yes,
ladies and gentlemen, that
was our prerequisite Neon
Deion bashing for this col-
umn, and it is necessary.)

°The Carrier Dome has
seen an amazing amount of
bad free throw shooting in
its time. It was not so long
ago that Syracuse lost a lot of
basketball games on the free-
throw line. They were good
enough to win a lot more
games on pure talent.

The Pitt Panthers, on the
other hand, are not good
enough to survive perfor-
mances at the charity stripe
like their 19—of—35 effort at
the Carrier Dome Saturday
night. Pitt dug itself a hole
with a seven-for-22 start at
the line and never got out.

°Speaking of college
hoops, playing Arkansas is

supposed to be “4O minutes
of hell” for opponents. Do
you think the pain of losing
to a very average Alabama
team will stay with Nolan
Richardson’s crew a little
longer than that?

°In the “no wonder they
stink” category is the latest
trade by the Dallas
Mavericks. A young team in
major need of rebuilding
unloads veteran guard Derek
Harpers. Fine. Oh, by the
way, part of the return pack-
age is 31-year-old Toni
Campbell, who is also hurt.

°From the NFL rumor mill:
Joe Gibbs has been men-
tioned as a possible choice

' to replace Jerry Glanville as

head coach in Atlanta. That
is like trading in a Yugo for a
Mercedes. In addition to the
question of whether or not
Gibbs would actually take
the job, how did the perenni-
ally mismanaged Falcons
think of such a good idea?
Remember, this is one of
Deion Sanders’ part—time
employers.

(Check that out, two Neon
Deion bashings for the price
of one column. Does that not
make you feel all warm and
tingly inside?)
