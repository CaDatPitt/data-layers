HARRISBURG AP--Governor"

Shapp proposed Tuesday an
austere 15-month budget that calls
for $5.47 billion in spending from
July 1, 1975, to ' September 30,
1976. Y

He predicted special
groups won’t like it. .
P “It is a budget that should receive
general public support because it
holds the line on spending and calls
forno new general fund taxes,”
Shapp said. ’ ’

into its component parts, it may not
receive favor from many indivi-
duals and "groups seeking addi-
tional funds to support _speciﬁc

' programs which they favor.’.’ .
The 14 state-owned colleges and
the three state-related schools"
Penn State, Pitt and Temple--all

fﬂill receive modest budget

increases. .

But the 14 state-owned institu-
tions must increase tuition $50 a
year to balance their budgets under
Shapp’s plan. I

Shapp spoke before a ‘televised
joint session of -the legislature. His
speech was carried by two
commercial and two public tele-
vision stations. Others taped _the
20-minute speech for delayed’

 ~._.,lg_roadcasts.

The .15-month spending plan,
_which would equal a $464 payment
for every Pennsylvanian, is a 9.6
per cent increase over current
expenditures. Most of the
increases are required by law.

The $5.47 billion represents
Shapp’s general fund budget--the
spending program A ﬁnanced by
taxes on the public at large and
business. Examples are the
personal income, corporate income

News analysis

 

BY BILL MOOBE

Students will be faced with a
severe tuition increase, and the
University will be forced to pain-
fully tighten its belt, if Governor
Milton J_. Shapp’s minimal appro-
priations increase for the Univer-
sity‘ is accepted by 1 the state
legislature.

Shapp’s austere budget, aimed at
avoiding any tax hike this year, has
left many short of their predicted
needs. Pitt has been left far short.

The probable -effect will be a
cutback in programs, perhaps
worse than already suggested, a
continuation of the hiring freeze,
and a hike in tuition. V

This year, Pitt requested roughly

$62 million for 12 months and_

Shapp recommended roughly $65
million for 15 months. Last year
Pitt received roughly $52 million

the government needs the press to"
act as a watchdog, by reading FBI
and ‘CIA files on private citizens to
an overﬂowing crowd at David

In a speech entitled “The Presi-
dency and the Press,” Anderson
told Pitt students he realized there
was a tendency, in an age rocked,
by news shocks and scandal, for
many people to believe the press
misrepresents facts. 5

“But we try to ' get the facts
straight,” insisted Anderson.
“We don't always succeed, but we
try.”

One reason journalists often do
not succeed in providing the whole
truth, he said, is nobody is willing
to give it to them.

' However, the Janis motion was

The American people cannot be

The troops were pulled‘ out as

yet there is no end to it all - even
after we have succeeded in
bringing not only peace, but
“peace with honor."

Our lack of receptiveness to the
issue is not the result of a
conversion to some new form of
pacifism. We got tired of Vietnam.

the troop withdrawals we ‘have
watched and read endless accounts
of “the tragedy of Vietnam,” and
we have become satiated to the
point of emotional vomiting. This is
understandable.

What is unforgivable,.however, is
the attempt to wipe Indochina out
of our consciences the way we
nearly wiped it off the map.

Ziegler may be a crook, who
arrogantly lied to the American

the Board to decide whom we can
have speak to us and whom not?
On the contrary, the Board should
be most eager to have Ziegler here

him for the liar that he is, at the

But there's a higher principle

That was Turkey’s stand when it
threatened to withdraw from NATO
because of Congress’ arms embar-
go. The new Ethiopian government
has suddenly come alive and

requests arms for its civil war. All I

Bhutto of Pakistan visited Presi-
dent Ford recently, seeking mili-
tary aid against India. The ultimate
came when India announced it is
hoping to purchase American A-4

Skyhawk attack fighters, transport
planes and maritime reconnais-
sance aircraft.

The US will undoubtedly supply
all who request’ it (even if they are
on opposing sides) simply because
it is now the American thing to do.
It's also good business.

So good that supplying Israel with
military defense was not enough.
When our French ally stepped up
its arms shipments to the Arabs,
the United States was prodded into
a little salesmanship of its own by
agreeing to train Saudi-Arabians to
defend their oil installations.

Political cartoonists had a field"
day when the announcement came‘
that the Vinnell Corporation was

undertaking the training of military 4

forces for the Arab world’s largest
oil producer. There is little sense in
supplying military power to both
sides of any issue, let alone one as
touchy as the Middle East. It takes
involvement with only one side for
a country to get burned. With two,-
the United States could very well
end up a fine black ash. '
The decisions that result in fiascos
like this are usually hatched in the

entering a profes-
as a senior. The
schools”
go their separate

possibility of
sional school
“professional
“disciplines”

ways, and students are necessarily ’

‘bewildered. . .

By and large, the material in a
political science undergraduate
concentration in public administra-
tion is about the same as that in the

first‘year of almost any graduate 

program in the field. Indeed, upper
division CAS courses aregcustom-
arily eligible for graduate credit,
and the new concentration is upper
division. The result is that to enroll
in such a concentration is to do
about the same thing one would do
in the first year at any graduate
school and, because public admin-
istration customarily draws in
people from many disciplines,
graduate programs are likely to
include the same material for many
years. To view enrollment in an
undergraduate public administra-
tion concentration as preparation
for graduate study in the same
field,‘ therefore, is to envision
preparation for doing the ‘same
thing twice. \ _
The Pitt News also should stay
abreast of undergraduate “man-
agement" programs in General
Studies, aimed of course at the
part—time students so important to
Pitt. Overall, the large question’
might well be whether it makes
sense to think about undergraduate
degrees speciﬁcally labeled say, as
‘~'administration," this raises the

4

and the ,

Arms, Alliances, and Dollars

business arena, then go on for '

approval in Washington. “The
business of America is business" is
an all too familiar tune to be
playing at a. time when new
orchestration is called for.

One can imagine the curious news ‘
account that may well follow our
indiscriminate weapon marketing:
“Thousands of American busi-
nessmen and their families were
airlifted today by the US Air Force
from Saudi-Arabian oil ﬁelds.
Several planes involved in the
airlift were shot down, however, by
American Air Force jets." How
would the casualty list be com-
piled? “Dead -- 240 Saudi
Americans, 200 American Ameri-
cans." I

The question boils down to
freedom versus free enterprise.

Unleash all the thermonuclear

force in the world and ten-to-one ‘

says this country's most ruthless "
and ambitious proﬁteers released
from n all commercial restrictions
would still consume the earth
faster, and about seven times over
at that. .

Somewhere someone is fashioning
a noose to ﬁt snugly around this
country's apple pie-fed neck, and
at some placealong the line there is
an American ﬁnancing the whole
operation.

Any commitments made or‘
maintained by the United States in
the near future will be based on its

ﬁnancial proﬁtability to good ole _

Number One. Thisstands to reason

because of the lack of moral’

leadership to effect any change
otherwise. 

In order to base international ties

Locking Towers V

ForPetty Crime S

‘Tothe Editor,

~45

I have a question for Mr. Tom '

Albert. Have there been enough
violent crimes in the dorms to
justify your security plan? To
cause so many problems to people
who wish to go to the dorms just to
try to stop petty crime (most of
which is caused by Pitt students,
anyway), seems ridiculous. The
only way to stop all crimewould be
to empty the Towers and lock all
the doors.

Pressing Problem

Of Book Prices

:"f_ ,,_\Dear Editor,

4,

Tc’

New Student Government, take
heed! This is an economic matter
which concerns all of us in addition
to tuition. _

Looking over my cost for books
this term, I came out with an $85.86
bill for 15 credits. This includes
only the price of textbooks not
notebooks, lab cards, folders, etc.
It seems that expenses could be
lower. For instance, often only
parts of books are used for class or
books are only used for a couple
weeks. CouIdn’t the important
points of those books be discussed
in lecture instead? Could a limit be
set as to the cost of required books

for courses?

Some people have suggested
sharing textbooks with classmates,-
but it’s rare at a large campus like
Pitt to ﬁnd friends in all your
classes. Also, many students are
commuters making it difficult to
share texts.

How about used books? The
resale value of books is extremely
low. Sometimes the book is not
even used again, which might be
saying something about the care
used in selecting them. Buying
used books is OK if you don’t mind

waiting a week or so for the Student

bookstore’s used books are a help
in saving $.50-$1.00 but it’s not
enough help. Also, don’t forget the

even if you do find a used book, you
may have already bought the book

No Scarlet Letter

In Baird Speech

To the Editor,

Rita Cunningham's letter to the
Pitt News of February 21 said Bill
Baird "revealed “...at a public
meeting the private details of other

person's sex lives, and an accom-
panying cry for vindictive action."

She found it “...reminiscient of...
the cruel Puritan mores recounted
in Hawthorne's The Scarlet Let-
ter."

Dorothy Hubbell doesn’t see it
that way. Hers was the story told
by Mr. Baird. For four years she
has been pleading for aid, from the
Church and from Father Robert
Hubal. -He is the man, who, she
says, fathered Dawn, her Mongo-
Ioid child. Her pleas have been
ignored. For years she has had to

support her family of five on $250 a I

month, bearing alone the responsi-
bility of Dawn.

She requested Baird's aid, having
made the decision to publicize the
story. She and Baird held a press

conference on February 11, which

was attended by representatives of
all of Pittsburgh's main media

— outlets. So far. only the Pittsburgh

Forum has carried the story. (See
the Friday, February 21 issue of the
Forum.) . »

Ms. Hubbell “was fully aware
Baird would be telling her story in
his speeches at Pitt. She wants her
story publicized. Baird wasn't
handing out scarlet letters; he
wasn't denouncing the priest_ for
having sex. He was outraged by
the burden Ms. Hubbell has had to
bear. and by the hypocrisy evi-

The Greek system is alive and well
and doing fine at Pitt this week.

Pitt’s Greeks are smack in the
middle of their annual bash this
week, with festivities climaxing in
Saturday night’s Greek Formal.

Greek Week '75 focused on char-

~ity activities for the Heart Fund,

and the Greek Blood Drive. This
year's Carnival alone raised more
than $200 for. the Heart Fund.

Four fraternities and five sorlori-1

ties gave 100% blood to Allegheny
County’s Central Blood Bank in
this year's drive--enough donations
for every Greek on campus to be
covered by the Blood Bank's‘ group
plan. They were: Pi Kappa Alpha,

Phi Kappa Theta, Delta Phi and.

Delta Sigma Phi A fraternities, ‘ and
Delta Delta Delta, Delta Zeta, Chi
Omega, Delta Phi Epsilon and
Theta Phi Alpha sororities.

Winners of the Chariot Race were
FIJI and Kappa Kappa Gamma.
Place was taken by SPIKA and
Tri-Delta and who was a tie
between the team ‘of Delta Zeta,
Delta Sigma Chi, Delta Chi and
Lambda Sigma Rho and the team of
Alpha Delta Pi, Sigma Chi and
Theta Chi. -

COMING UP: Wednesday night's
chugging contest, Talent Night and
the Greek Formal. Together with
Pitt Engineers, the Greeks bring
you Herbie Hancock and Miles
Davis in concert at the Mosque

they (administration) will probably
wait to see what hope they have of
getting a greater appropriation out
of the legislature before acting on a
tuition increase,” Pratt said.

Student Government Board Presi-
dent Larry Platt was also let down
by Shapp’s recommendation for
Pitt, and stressed the need for a
student push to convince state
house and senate members to
allocate Pitt increased funds.

“I think there is a good chance of
getting more out of the legis-
lature,” Platt said, “but we will
have to work for it.”

Platt, along with leaders from two
other Pitt student governments, is
organizing a phone call and letter
campaign by students, aimed at
letting legislators know of student
concern. _ .

Platt said he will be working with
the Pennsylvania Student Lobby
and Pitt’s Harrisburg lobbyist Russ
Arnold to convince legislators. ’

and sales levies.

The spending ﬁgure would rise to
$9.07 billion if federal revenue
sharing. other federal funds and
special state funds are added. The
special funds include: motor
license, ﬁnanced by vehicle fees
and fuel taxes; game, supported by
hunting licenses; and ﬁsh, backed
by ﬁshing permits. _

In the past, a state budget_covered
12 months during a Financial year
that began July 1 and ended June
30.

The 15-month budget was used
this time to coincide with a change
in the federal ﬁscal year, which will
be moved from a July 1. to October
1 start beginning in 1976.

The 9.6 per cent increase, is
calculated on. a 12-month basis,
comparing the current fuscal year
ending June 30 to the estimated
12-month spending period begin-
ning July 1. The comparable
spending ﬁgures are $4.39 billion
for 1974-75 and $4.81 billion for
1975-76. '

Shapp said he once hoped to
announce that Pennsylvania could
fund all essential programs.

“All that is now out the _window,”
he said. “The reality of the
situation is that Pennsylvania, like
all other states. is caught in the
greatest economic squeeze since
the dark days of the recessions of
the 19505 and perhaps since the
depression of the ’30s.”

Nearly half the general fund

‘expenditures--48.5 per cent--will
‘go for. education.

Economic
development and income main-
tenance, which includes welfare,
will total 17.1 per cent and health
spending 15.6 per cent.

Of the $422 million increase from
the current to the next fiscal
year--based on a 12-month com-
parison--$385 million is required by
law.

The largest increase is a $127
million hike for welfare recipients
caused by an expected boost in
caseload during bad economic
times. Shapp also proposed a 6 per
cent increase in cash welfare grants

to combat inflation effective Sep-
tember 1--a hike that was not
required.

Other required increases went for
public school subsidies, salaries
and retirement pay for present and
former state employees, commun-
ity mental health programs, medi-
cal assistance, grants to the aged,
blind and disabled.

Shapp also is transferring $175
million that is now subject to
litigation into the general fund. ‘

The money originally was for
reimbursements to parents of
nonpublic school pupils. The
program was ruled by the courts,
but proponents of they plan are
ﬁghting for distribution of the
money already collected.

The governor warned, “there are
some ‘ifs’ in the picture”--
especially concerning his intent to
hold taxes at present levels.

“We cannot.-look forward to the
rate of increase in state revenues
continuing at the same levels as in

(recent years,” Shapp said. “Last

year’s tax cut, rising unemploy-
ment and lower business activity
preelude this line of thought.

“A number of pending court cases
could result in judicial orders

‘increasing state spending.

“Realistically, too, under prevail-
ing attitudes, we cannot look
forward to receiving sufﬁcient aid
from Washington to meet the

’ growing legitimate needs of large

segments of our population.” ,

Anderson Views
( Continued from Page 1)

between Southern Christian Lead- 5

ership Conference leader Ralph D.
Abernathy and his wife, and a copy
of actress Jane Fonda’s notebook.

He also read a Secret Service _

report which described comedian‘
Groucho Marx as a menace to the
President, because an under-
ground newspaper had reported
Marx say:/ng' “Nixon’s assassina-
tion is the country’s only hope.”

When asked about the validity of
.that statement, Marx replied "I
deny everything,’_cause I never tell
the truth," Anderson said.

“All of this is interesting,” An-
derson said, “but it’s none of the
FBI’s business. It’s not a violation
of the law to disagree with the
government.”

But the reporter insisted on
putting his stories in perspective,
saying these examples of the
govemment’s abuse of power are
the exception rather than therule.

“I know of no other national police
force anywhere in the _world more
careful than the FBI of protecting
individual rights,” Anderson in-
sisted. “But we can’t tolerate even
this much abuse.”

Although most instances of illegal
domestic spying uncovered by
Anderson originated during the
Nixon -Administration,
attacked some actions of the Ford
Administration.

Specifically, he said US taxpayers
are still giving “welfare” to the
rich people.in America." ' *

“Nelson Rockefeller paid no fed-
eral income taxes
Anderson claimed. “I did.
were giving him welfare.
doesn't need it."

It would,be much better, said the
reporter, if that money-went to old
people who can no longer afford
anything better than pet food, or to
the growing number of starving
people in the country. i

“The President’s view is _that if
you give help to the rich, they will
employ more people. l’ll tell you
what the rich will do with that
money.‘ They'll put.‘ it in a Swiss
Bank. If, we’re going to give
welfare, Pd rather give it to poor
people who don’t have.Swi_ss Bank

Smooth, efficient performances by

Editor's note: The purpose behind these “duo reviews” is to contrast
the experience each critic shared with Pantagleize. One critic ran a
series of articles dealing with. the “behind the scenes” preparation.
The other critic approaches the play without any prior exposure to

Com-
ments such as “I think it's OK, but

I'm not wild about it," and “They,_
(the cast) are working hard and

they're doing a pretty good job, but
I don't like the play itself,” were

exchanged during the two ten-min-_

ute intermissions, that broke up the
2‘/2 hour, three-act play.

Although the cast gave perfor-
mances that might have been
called terrific, the poor script left
the audience relatively unmoved.

BY JESS M. BRALLIER ~ .

_ People really crack me up. . -

And when the"person (or persons) is one I respect, in a subtle way,
they crack me up all the more so. It so happens that I respect quite a
few people in areas related.to the artistic experience.

Anyway, here’s today’s problem: all too many people of the art world
are in my opinion unnecessarily worried about the "masses. Yeah,
everybody wants to help the damn masses. "

Forget the damn masses, leave them alone, leave everybody
alone...espécial1y me. You see, this has me a bit worried. After all, it

Zrsiﬁnids just a‘bit too much like political and religious movements which

at frustrating times seem simply based on bothering people.
.-Back to the relevant. Consider the many cries for assistance that go
out each’ year for the advancement of the masses’ cultural appreciation.
That’s amusing...isn’t it? . V

I mean here’s allthese people who consider themselves apart from
the masses who hope to make the masses‘ like themselves or in‘ other

. words become in time, a part of the very mass who 'they’re worried

about. Good God,’ if successful over a period of time, there won’t be
any masses or else everything will be one mass without anybody left to«
worry about the mass...Catch 18?

It seems to me, therefore, that the simplest, easiest thing for all these ' \

worried people to do is not worry for as concerns myself, I sure as hell
don’t wish to be taxed by some supposed do-gooder who wants my
money to in turn make me like themselves. Just leave the damn
masses alone. -

When it comes to artistic qualities, I worry twice as much. If I
remember, lasttime around, I still had the choice to education and the I
amount and form I wish _it to take. Hell, I don’t need any

representative of any academic institution jamming hooks up my ear -

when I’d rather be jamming beer down my throat, or vice versa. And I
don’t want anybody to label me anti-social or shy becauseiI’d rather
read than dance. And pity the masses who want to watch Carol Burnett
but are being pressured becausethey won’t get up on their tired feet
and drive to some silly theatre to watch a Fellini ﬁlm...leave the poor
guy alone. ‘

Now, we’ve all heard that Calvin Coolidge helped mess things up
enough to,cause a depression but at the same time, I think he had a lot
to offer. ‘ . '

It seems that Calvin did what basically turned out to be
nothing...yeah, he used to go into the presidential office each morning
of his term, pull down the blinds,.turn out the lights and then after

same common place slapstick we
are accustomed to seeing in old
Laurel and Hardy or Chaplin
movies. Director David L. Rinear
has accented the grotesqueness of
such slapstick in‘ an attempt to
make something workable from the
script. Unhappily for the play,
tricks such as spinning the hero
around and around (by having the
other actors in the scene continual-
ly jostel him as they rush here and
there) are not really funny any-
more.

The poet. ‘Blank’ (played by
Edward Bromberg) is written into

‘the script as “effeminate, with a

very high-pitched voice.” In the
play, Blank comes off as homo-
sexual, to the point of wearing
lipstick. While Bromberg was
effective as a homosexual, one
wonders if the over-emphasis on
the character was necessary.

DeGhelderode himself has de-
scribed Pantagleize as a “farce to
make you sad." (Quote from the
'Director’s Notes in the Program)
At least 15 members of the
audience were so sad they left
between the second and third acts.
The early departures may also have
been because of the length of the
play.

Within the limitations of the
script, Pantagleize was well direct-
ed for the most part, and well

performed. Henry Heymann’s set
consisted of two ramps, several
tables and chairs, and a bed during

one scene. All the props, including,

the backdrop and the costumes by
Lynne R. Hemingway, were grey,
black or white. The backdrop was a
grey-blue shiny plastic. The re-
voluntionaries each wore some-
thing red as a means of identifica-
tion. At several points, the lighting
crew, led by Richard Knowles,
used a black light to produce
special effects in the costuming,
particularly to bring out astronomi-
cal symbols.

At the beginning of the play, the
sound system in the auditorium
went berserk, but it turned out
Frank McCarty (scoring and sound
effects) had planned it that way.
The audience eventually accepted
the distorted music and voices as
part of the general surrealistic
effect. The French national
anthem, the ‘Marseillaise,’ was the
dominant musical theme.

During the course of the ‘revolu-
tion,’
simulated cannon ﬁre complete
with muzzle ﬂashes. As least once,
some kind of simulated explosion
virtually blinded the audience,
even in the last rows, for a few
seconds. The intensity of both
effects was unnecessary.

It is unfortunate the script of
Pantagleize offers so little. ' It was

there was a good deal of

 “Pantagleize” Just Saves Face

obvious the cast put a lot of work
into their parts. In Pantagleize,
however, the best acting becomes
barely enough to keep the audience
from going to sleep.

Why the University of Pittsburg
Theatre chose Pantagleize for the
winter term is a mystery. The
theme of the 1974-75 theatre
season is ‘social revolt’ (Cabaret,
Pantagleize and—coming next-
Look Back in Anger by John
Osborne) but there must.certainly
be other plays that could have
served the

Body Politic Theatre;

A‘Dream Come True

BY HARRIS LEVY
There was this hundred pound
bearburger. Yeah, and this guy
telling a bear riding a bicycle that
the bearburger was her son.

A play? A dream? Both. Chicago’s
Body Politic Dream Theatre per-
forms dreams. But its imaginative
talent is for real.

“We dream of Tours”: A group of
tourists are being led through a
house. And they're enthralled by
what they see. It’s a rather unusual
tour in a rather ordinary house. A
woman wakes up from her nap to
find tourists swarming in her
bedroom, her dresser, and oh, the
messy closet.

It gets stranger: the tour is joined
by ‘two loud, rude punks. The

woman’s son shows up and he and

his mother taunt the intruders,
drawing them into bed. The two
guys are trapped between the
frighteningly seductive son and
mother. But the son and mother
aren't entirely in control of their
act, either.

Pure Desire, the show the Dream

Theatre performed for the Pitts-'

burgh 99 Cent Floating Theatre
Festival, was several prepared
dreams and dreams improvised
from recollections of audience
members. 0

rated their dreams, the cast’

members acted them out. The
dreams magically shifted from the
commonplace to the fantastic--from
entering a new home to a chained
bear in the back r'oom.

Dreams are a doorway to  7.,-r
imagination, director Jim Shifletti"

explained afterward. “A dream
isn't just a psychological thing, it’s

1 the head putting together a story,”

he said.

The dreams start with familiar,
recognizable situations and shift to
the bizarre. But as everyday reality
is left behind, universal symbols
remain. The company did a bear
dream but bears were part of
several audience dreams, too.
Falling, falling, falling. Running,
running, running. And strangers
and strange questions. The stuff
dreams are made of. '

While the prepared dreams w:;:_(ﬁ,;

clever and sophisticated,
Dream Theatre’s real forte was
improvisation.

The audience dreams lacked the
spell-binding power of the drama-
tized version of Kaﬂ<a’s A Country
Doctor. But half the fun of the
improvisations was seeing how the
company would enact the dream as
it was being told. Sometimes
actors were transformed into desks
and lampposts, not just hear-
burgers.

The Clemson team has a lot of
talented‘ players. Ten or eleven
players see action every game.

The Clemson strength is in the
‘middle, where “Tree” Rollins,‘ a
7'1" sophomore center, controls
the action. Rollins averages 12.8

-points and 11.7 rebounds per

‘game. He was second team
All-ACC, behind North Carolina
center Mitch Kupchak.

The other big gun for the Tigers is
6’4" freshman guard Skip Wise.
Wise‘ averaged 18.6 points per
game to become the first freshman
named to the All-ACC ﬁrst team.

Rounding out the Clemson team
are Stan Rome, a 6’5” freshman
averaging 10.1 points and 4.7
rebounds, Wayne Croft, a 6’9”
senior forward averaging 7.9 points
and 7.8 rebounds, and senior

‘guard, 6’1” Jo Jo Buthea, averag-

Clemson's talent and torrid pace,

Granted the Eastern Track
Championship is the biggest, the
best and the most colorful meet this
side of the Nationals.

But why should all the good
things be mixed with so many bad_
things like, poor organization, poor
refereeing, and being too big for its
own good?

Its a serious question, but the
point is the bad things cost the Pitt
Tracksters a highranking in the
overall score. 1

“Everyone did very well; it was

-just a series of unfortunate breaks

that cost us," said Head Track
Coach Jim Banner. "‘Stil1, every-

phis State. Memphis State handed
in impressive performances, falling
just. short of third ranked Louisville
at Louisville and defeating Tulsa at
Tulsa, Western Kenturcky, and

“Florida State.

Memphis also boasts a stellar
center in Marion “Elevator”, Hil-
lard at 6’9”. The Elevator aver-
ages 14.2 points per game and
pulls down an average 12.5 re-
bounds. ~

While Hillard plugs up the mid-
dle, 'BillCook and Dexter Reed
provide Memphis State with a hot

shooting backcourt. Cook‘ is‘ the A

high scorer on the squad, averag-
ing 19.1 points. While Reed scores

fewer points than Cook (14.5), he is‘ ,

the team’s hub. 3 _‘
When Reed started the season,
the Memphis team won -its first six

‘ games. But when Reed was out for

a twelve-game stretch due to
injury, Memphis had-"quite a few
problems keeping’ the team toge-
ther. When" Reed returned to the
team, it went on another six-game
win streak. Stop Reed _and you stop
Memphis State. . 

- When things start to gobad on the A

backcourt, 1' though, State can de-
pend on 6’9” freshman forward
John Gunn, who averages 9,5
points and. l1_.9 rebounds per
game, and either John Tiinstall or
Ed Wilsson, both 6’7” junior for-

’ wards who between them average

13.3 points and 8.0 reboundsper

' game. \

Two other teams have to be
seeded high in the tournament. St.
John's and Lafayette, although not
of "the caliber. of Clemson or
Memphis "State, could offer a
challenge if Clemson or Memphis
State falter. . ~

Lafayette has 22' wins and only
five losses this season, and for a
team that offers no athletic schol-
arships, -this is something of a
minor miracle. Lafayette plays a
weak schedule, though, and this
could hamper it when it plays
teams of higher caliber in the NIT.

St. John's has twice beaten Provi-

dence, another NIT-bound team,’

and has a.l9-8 record. Of the three’

...a...... of 3.... 3......

one handled themselves very well,
especially the youngsters.“

Take the case of Chuck Mozingo.
Having his strongest race of the
year, “Moze” ran the third fastest
time of the entire meet, including
the finals, but didn’t place in the
top six.

“The 600 competition was indeed
the sharpest and most ‘competitive
ever ran at the lC4A’s. His case
was just something that happens in
huge meets such as this from time
to time,” Banner said.

_l(arl Farmer was the victim of
another bad break, the overruling
of a referee. A

“When the ref was overruled,”
Banner said, “It put seven men in
the finals, forcing them to run two
heats. The first heat was made up
of three Seton Hall men, which was

- indeed unfair.” ’

Seton Hall has probably the best
sprinters in the East.
“Karl finished fourth overall in a

photo finish, but even the fans .

were disappointed with what hap-
pened,” Banner continued. “I
never heard booing at a track meet
until this event.” ~

.The Pitt distance medley relay,
dormant since the Pitt Invitational,
came to life at Princeton, capturing
a fifth place finish. The surprising
thing about.this was three of the
four runners are freshman and the
fourth’ is only a sophomore.-

“The distance medley team was
outstanding,” said Banner. “They
took two whole seconds off their
best time previously (9:59 to 9:57),
which is excellent for underclass-
men."

What, you might. ask, happened to
Rich Markley, ‘who had- finally

found the competition he had
wanted all indoor season? The
truth is you can’t be perfect all
season long, and so it was with
“Sparkle."

“Rich undoubtedly ran the worst
race he entered all season,” said M
Banner. “He was stiff the entire‘§§'\*
race and looked way off form. The
‘trouble was-he just tried too hard
for this one.”

Not placing at the Easterns was
bad’ enough, but the really bad
news came Monday night.‘ '

‘‘I received a call from the
National Collegiate Athletic As-
sociation Organizing Committee
informing me‘Rich had lost his

_ invitation to the Nationals by doing

badly at Princeton,” said Banner.
“With the overall competition for

the Nationals so high, ‘they were

forced to raise their entry stand-
ards and Rich was left out. It took a

, lot of courage to reduce the field in_',_4§;s

the 1,000 and the mile relay, but it
was a decision which had to be
made. V -

“We were never out of any race,”
Banner continued. “With three
photo finishes_ you know how keen .r
the competition was for our guys.-
The younger guys were especially‘
cool under all the pressure and that
is something to look forward to for
the outdoors.” A is

As expected,‘ Seton Hall, on the
strength‘ of its sprinters and mile
relay, took . the 'overall team‘
championship, edging out a sur-
prisingly, tough Maryland squad
37-34. Thatvis ironic, because Pitt — V ,5

put its-~high-scoring machine in
motion --to grab still another.

‘Among the league’s top ten
scorers--including the top three--
’are six Panthers.

Rick Vernon finished the regular
season as the league’s‘top scorer
with 33 goals and 19 assists for 52
points. Overall the Panther right
winger tallied 44 goals and assisted
on 25 others to complete another
fine season at Pitt. ‘

tenth (22 points). ‘

Jumpin Johnny DeFazio was the
league’s top goaltender, allowing a
mere 1.72 goals per game and
turning in one shutout.

When Buzz Ridl came to Pitt in
1968, the condition of Pitt’s
basketball program was perilous,
and some would have argued the
program should-have been on the

endangered species list.
7,, From 1964 - 1967, Panther teams
/7 mjfﬁiggled to a combined record of
25 wins and 67 losses, and there
I were no signs the situation would
improve. Butchange of a revolu-

tionary nature has occurred since‘ A

-then. A
Pitt has evolved from a group of
. patsies to a team that, for the past
. two years, has continually hovered
’ near the top 20 position, and for the
first time in quite a while has
-defeated a number
basketball teams.
After last season's sensational
25-4 mark, people were anxiously
looking forward to another great
’ season. But the dreams werenot
as-j§~p_iuckly fulﬁlled.
Sandwiched between a win

against hapless Ohio Northermand .

a defeat against upstart Buclmell

were losses against West Virginia, I

Duquesne, Penn State, NC State,
Duke and Syracuse.

The past was a disaster; the future
was uncertain‘. ‘If there was one
positive ‘sign in December "74, it
had to be the Marquette game,
which the Panthers won 65-58. The
Warriors wereranked 7th nation-
ally and it was a game Pitt wasn’t
supposed to wing. Some were

waiting for a scalping. But Pitt did
win, and a flicker of hope
remained. ' .

Alas, it isthe beginning of March,
Pitt is going to its second
post-season tournament in a row,
and the future looks even brighter
than the past.

And the man who turned it all
around was Ridl, as patient as he is
expert in the art of coaching. There
was no doubt this year’s squad was
a multi-talented one, but it’s little
comfort to have talent but not win
many games.

The reason Ridlfs team made such

an abrupt turnabout was as much a

function of the individual personal-
ities on the team as anything else.
That's why Pitt has been able to
win 12 of its last 15 games. ‘

“I wasn’t discouraged with our
team back in December,” says
Ridl. “I knew December was going
to be our toughest hurdle; and

while we were losing I still-saw a lot A

of capabilities. It’s part of an
athlete’s life not to be discouraged,
and while it’s easy to show your

mental toughness when you’re'

winning, it takes more to show it
when you're losing.” .
‘Pitt did display its mental
toughness; rebounding from the

Bucknell defeat to beat Notre
Dame, Penn‘ State, Rutgers and
Temple. By then the hurdles had
for the most part been overcome.
To overcome the obstacles, it
required ajoint effort on the_part of
everyone on the team; the old
cliche contained a great deal of
truth. The only way a coach can be
assured of having a team capable of
ﬁghting off adversity is to recruit
individuals who do it. This has
been a large factor in Ridl's
successf '

“We try to get the player we feel I

can add something more than just
his basketball .skills to our
program,”
takes a 17-10 record into the NIT in
New York on Saturday. “Infact,”
Ridl explains, “we pass up many
individuals‘ who are great basket-
ball players because we don‘t feel
they would fit into our system. We

‘have many different personalities

on this team, but we’re all pretty
close knit.” ' ’

Fromtime to time you may ﬁnd a
few dissatisfied individuals on. the
team who feel . they should be
playing, more. But you won’t find
any hotheads.

_ 'Ridl is a coach well-schooled in

the fundamentals of basketball,

  Ridl Leads censre neeegninen,  

and although soft-spoken, he's still
a competitor, because you don't
survive as a major college coach
unless you have that competitive
spirit deep within you.

Regardless of the outcome of the-

NIT. the fact remains Ridl has done
an exceptional job at Pitt, moving a
program from undisputed loser to.
proven winner.

Nobody ‘can predict with any
degree of certainty ‘the future of

Six or eight teams have a shot at

winning the tournament, Pitt a-
mong them. Memphis State, Oral

South Carolina. Clemson, and by
some miracle, maybe Providence.

Galloway, Tartan co-captain and
left winger, thinks that the
Panthers are not just going to skate
away with the title without a fight
from CMU. The Tartans should
join Pitt in the championship game
on Sunday.

“I thought the last game was
extremely close and this one could
go either way,” he said. “I hope

we can get thetcrowd behind us.

because it means a lot.”

In a sense, the Tartans will have a
slight advantage going into the
game because they have larger
following than the Panthers. It is
hard to seelwhy the Pitt hockey

‘ team, one of the "finest ever at the

University, always plays before a
sparse crowd. You can probably
hear more noise over in the
Hillman Library.

The Panthers’ opponent Thursday
should be Duquesne, unless,some

unforeseen event occurs.
Dukes are led by Tim Boylan (11
goals and 16 assists) Frank
Copeland (22 points) and C.H.
Bender (16 points and the key man
in the Duquesne defense). '

CMU, meanwhile, will draw
Indiana to play again on Thursday
if the Tartans win over IUP tonight
in Kittanning; The CMU attack
will be headed by Dave Cornelius,

Six members Of the Pitt wrestling
team are preparing for the NCAA
wrestling tournament beginning
tomorrow evening at Princeton
The meet will run

colleges and universities will be
represented by the 370 attending
wrestlers. ' '

Jimmy Carr from the University of
Kentucky - possibly the top
lightweight in the country - will
also go at 120 pounds. Carr was a
member of the‘ US-‘Olympic team
two years ago and has rolled up an
impressive record in his ﬁrst year
at Kentucky. . ‘ -

Penn State's John Fritz, who
finished third in the Nationals the
past two years, will also be up
against Bryant. In the Pitt-Penn
State dual meet earlier this year at
Pitt Fieldhouse,-I Bryant and Fritz
tied 8-8 in a very exciting contest.
Fritz was eliminated from a shot at
the title last year when he suffered

a defeat at the hands of Pitt’s
Stottlemyer.

Stottlemyer should also run into
his share of championship ‘mater-
ial, in particular, Kevin Belnap of
William & Mary. The two wrestlers
met prior to this season in the
Millersville tournament, with Bel-
nap copping the decision by one
point in overtime. -

Don Rohn of Clarion. who ﬁnished
third‘ last year at 142 and was an
NCAA champion the year before,

will also wrestle at 134 despite the

fact that he has competed'—at a

Their nemeses are also acted with
vitality and humor. Robert
Reusch’s sinister spy, Wayne

Binott’s crusty generalissimo, Toby
Beckwith’s blustery general, and
the cold, bland efficiency of Polly
Bolton and Jocelyn Johnson as
bank officials were good foils'for

And don’t forget the four massive
hulks who are suitably threatening

costumes, lighting, sets and music
for University Theatre productions
are so consistently outstanding that
audiences may take them for
granted. Pantagleize has little in
common with Cabaret. But the
designers seem to thrive on the
variety. Lynne R. Hemingway’s
costumes achieve the ﬁlm effect
and at the same time exemplify the
characters’ personalities. The
dichotomy between Bamboola’s
tuxedo and his ‘short, brightly
patterned pants symbolizes the gap
between his aspirations and his
reality. ,

that starts with live laughter
followed by taped laughter and
then live laughter by different
characters in a different setting is
especially notable.

Henry Heymann's set, like the
costumes, overcomes the lack of
color. A long carpeted platform,
raised and tilted with a ramp
underneath, is ﬂexible_ enough to
serve as a wall, Pantagleize’s
house and a bar.

Richard Knowles’ lighting takes
full advantage of the trapezoids
and plastic as well as of a black
light. Knowles’ lighting and
technical direction subtly reinforce
comic and tragic elements. When
needed, they ‘can supply a blinding
ﬂash too.

If audiences don’t always appre-
ciate the work of the designers,
they’re not even aware of the
existence of the students who build ,
and run the show. The sets and the
props were made by some talented,
hardworking students, and the
efforts of students on costumes and
running the show deserve the
highest praise. The performanceiof
Pantagleize that I saw surpassed
prior University Theatre produc-
tions with" its smooth operation of
lights, sound and costume
changes. I -

So you can’t carry a hot dog into a
performance of Pantagleize. But
the production of Pantagleize will
remind you that a lot of creative

Hammett Hooks Fiction 

Butts With “Continentol"  

(Continuedlfrom Page II)

Pinkerton operative. Five novels
were also published by 1934, when
his career tapered off.

What makes Hammett’s fiction
special? Hammett knew the world
he wrote about. He wrote about the
seamy side of life in classy New
York apartments as well as seed
Mexican dives.

Hammett was a major innovator of
American detective ﬁction. In The
Simple Art of Murder, Raymond
Chandler, ‘himself a fine novelist

-wrote, .“Hammett gave murder

back to the kind of people that
commit it for reasons, not just to
provide a corpse, and with the
means at hand, not with hand-
wrought dueling pistols, curare and

tropical ﬁsh. He put these people ,

down on paper as they are and he
made them talk and think in the
language they customarily used for
these purposes.”

Besides success at creating plau-
sible characters, Hammett’s books
had style. Tough, biting dialogue.
Real sophistication: Sam Spade is a
complex character, not just a tough
guy. And the bantering between
detective Nick Charles and his wife
Nora is one of The Thin Man's"
strongest assets.

Hammett’s,ﬁrst two novels, Red’
Harvest and The Dain Curse,
featured a namelesséidetective
known as The Continental Op. The

Op was nor your matinee-idol hero.
He was, as Steven Marcus notes in
his fine introduction, “short, thick-
set and balding.”

The Continental Op brings toge-
ther seven previously uncollecte.cl.&5\f;-./-
stories. And its publication is ran  A
ideal occasion for readers to start
reading Hammett.

Sometimes. these early works

(don’t quite have the masterful

plotting of the novels. Things
happen too quickly. But Hammett’s
fine cynical wit is there throughout.
As is his ‘ability to create engros-
sing situations and remarkable
characters. I;Iammett’s people

were unique mixtures of - realistic

4» traits and unusual lifestyles. Like a
sweet old couple who turn out to be

hardened crooks. -

The stories in The Continental Op
are diverse in setting and plot. But . kg
they’ve all got Hammett’s ability t”€""
see through the veneer of Prohibi-
tion-era society. Besides the gal-
lery of criminals, Hammett gives us
the Op, a clever sleuth devoted to
getting the job done.

The best of these stories, such as
a hilarious Mexican adventure
called “The Golden Horseshoe,”
deserve to stand with the novels.

Those of us already hooked on
Hammett’s ﬁciton will welcome

The Continental ,Op as a worthy I
addition to our Hammett collec-
tions. And for people who know
Hammett only through the Hum-
phrfey Bogart movie, it’s a ﬁne AM’
