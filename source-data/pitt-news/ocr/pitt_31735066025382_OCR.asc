p IMHOTEP
recognizes
its priorities
By Suzann Gries

Re-teaching and re—educating
the history of the African peo-
ple is the goal of the IMHOTEP
Society, according to Assistant
Chairperson Justin Walls.

The IMHOTEP society is
named after Imhotep, a black
Egyptian mathematician and
doctor of medicine, because the
organization would like to
achieve greater knowledge of
black history.

“This European American
society, even in 1992, is never
going to admit that there is fur-
ther need for the advancement
of African people,” ~ IMHOTEP
society Chairperson Khafre K.
Abif said at the meeting last
night.

To start re—educating mem-
bers of the black community,
Abif comprised a list of books
which deal with how the
Eurocentric View of history has
destroyed the black co’mmuni— ’
ty’s sense of its own heritage
and culture.

“It is a perpetual system of
trying to keep us under oppres-
sion. Once we educate enough
African people about them-
selves, then those people can
change their own destiny,” Abif
said.

The list includes books such
as “The Miseducation of the
Negro” by Carter G. Woodson,
“Chains and Images of
Psychological Slavery” by Ni’am
Akbar and “The Destruction of
Black Civilization” by
Chancellor Williams. .

“What we hope to do is try to
enlighten people who do not
have the chance or have not
had the chance to take Black
Studies courses,” Walls said. “All
we hope to accomplish is that
somebody learns something.”

St/IR moves
to construct
new image

By Dawn Anderson
For The Pitt News

Students Against Racism dis-
cussed trying to shed its past
image and begin to move for-
ward with new goals at a
meeting held yesterday in the
Student Union. -

“We are rebuilding our
group and defining racism,”
St.A.R’s . President Joe
Babinsack said.

“We have to consider prob-
lems which include all races,
religions and gender —— not
only black and white issues,”
St.A.R. member Toya Beat
said during the Tuesday meet-
ing.

The members proposed a
list of goals which included
their responsibility not to just
ignore racism in any form but
to correct it.

St.A.R. also wants to spread
the concept of celebrating the
diversitylof every single per-
son.

Babinsack stated that they
intend on starting programs to
discuss racism in dormitories
and _area high schools
“because we must begin
somewhere.”

Babinsack acknowledged
that the group has had image
problems in the past but
would not discuss them to
any of the group’s new mem-
bers.

New members said that they
still get blamed for some
of problems of the past, but
they are willing to work
extremely hard to show that
they are creating a different
agenda.

The members of St.A.R
anticipate that the current
changes will produce new
members and help other
members of the university
community.

Pitt refuses Liquor Control Board's request for fake student ID's

Byjason Hillman

Editor in chief

Pitt has refused a written request from
Pennsylvania’s Liquor Control Board to
obtain fake college identification cards
to help them infiltrate university and fra-
ternity parties.

“I called the vice president for Student
Affairs at the University of Virginia
because of the difficulties they had
about a year and a half ago to find out
what kind of involvement they had with
the state police. It seems that they had
received a similar letter,” Vice
Chancellor for Student Affairs William
Harmon said at a meeting of the
Pittsburgh Council on Higher Education

\‘.\‘.§’l\l\ '.\.,\'x _\ '_\,.\-..'~ V l.’-‘lg:

Student Affairs committee last night. “I
don’t know if there’s something going
on regionally or nationally in this
regard, but they are taking the same
approach — that they will not give false
ID cards.”

The other members of the committee,
including Carnegie Mellon and
Duquesne, voiced similar policies
against giving out fake IDs.

“lThe agencies] are probably already
here,” Harmon said. “It’s just a matter of
enrolling in one course, taking one
credit-hour at Pitt, and you can get an
ID card. A legitimate one. And there’s
no reason to suspect that they are not
involved in that practice.”

“I understand what [the state agencies]

are trying to do,” Assistant Vice
Chancellor for Student Affairs Dennis
Donham said. “They can do it so many
different ways, involving other kinds of
subterfuge, that quite frankly, the insti-
tutions do participate in various ways.
Some of which is not even stuff we’re
privy to, in our position, which we very
much resent.”

Harmon ‘said he planned to meet with
the Interfraternity Council that night and
the Panhellenic Association at a future
date to tell them about the request and
to warn them to “be on their guard.”

Health Education Administrator Shirley
E. Haberman announced at the meeting
the creation of the Pittsburgh Area
College Consortium for the prevention

of alcohol and other drug problems.
The consortium is based on a
Department of Education grant that Pitt
received for drug education. The grant
was for around $38,000.

“Our primary purpose will be trying to.

develop alternative materials to the
advertising that's been put out there by
the alcoholic beverage industry,”
Haberman said. “I hope -to develop
materials that are more meaningful.”
Current ads go a long way to encour-
age excessive use of alcoholic bever-
ages, Haberman said. “Many of these
ads are directed or targeted for the col-
lege campus.” -

OAKLAND'S PLACE TO GET FIT"

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesdayﬁgptember 23, 1992

Women's studies continues to expand in its

By Beth Kovaly
Staff writer

The University of Pittsburgh’s
Women’s Studies program is plan-
ning to celebrate its coming-of-age.

The program, in its 21st year,
began with the hiring of three facul-
ty with women’s studies interests in
English, history and psychology.
Originally there were five courses
offered, that number has expanded
to 95.

Women’s Studies Director Susan
Hansen said enrollment in the cours-
es has increased by over 70 percent
in the past seven years.

“MoSt of our courses are closing,
and though there may be rumors
about a backlash against feminism,
certainly there’s continued strong
interest,” Hansen said. ' .

Hansen said that interest has been
shown by men as well as women.

“We don’t get men in large numbers,
but there are a few,” she said. “We
are very much open to male stu-
dents.”

In coming of age, the studies pro-
gram plans to establish a fund of
$21,000 through pledges and dona-
tions. Events are scheduled through-
out the coming year. Hansen said
the program will use the fund to
help support research and program-
ming.

“We really want to start research
on gender and excellence in teach-
ing,” Hansen said. “So we want to
set up a research fund for graduate
students who want to do disserta-
tions on any topic relating very
broadly to gender, whether it is liter-
ature, or psychology or whatever the
topic is.

“We’re also thinking about institut-
ing a teaching award for excellence
in teaching in the women’s studies

courses, and eventually we’d like to
have the funds to bring in visiting
faculty,” she said.

Hansen said that women’s studies
programs have become more com-
mon on campus’ throughout the
United States and that some smaller
schools may have gotten a head start
from Pitt. .

“IInI places like Indiana University
of Pennsylvania, the person who
started their program there had
gotten her Ph.D. at Pitt,” Hansen
said.

This is Hansen’s third year as the
director of Pitt’s Women’s Studies.
She also teaches in the political sci-
ence department and explained that
belonging in several departments is
common for the faculty involved in
women’s studies.

“Many [of the faculty] have joint
appointments in women’s studies
and whatever else their area is in the

guidelines for questions and
issues on alcoholic beverage
advertising.

“We will give all our institu-
tions an opportunity to get
together and keep discusing
and exploring different strate-
gies for dealing with alcohol
problems on our campuses,”
Haberman said.

Also at the meeting Dr.
Harmon updated the progress
on an “educational loop” — a
shu-ttle service in Oakland for

local universities.
“There was concern about
[safety and security. I headed
up a task force here on campus
that was commissioned by the
chancellor to look at safety and
security at Pitt,” Harmon said.
“That report has since been
completed and submitted to the
chancellor, who forwarded the
report to Dr. Ben Tuchi [vice
chancellor of Business and
Finance] [and] to John. DeVitto
Iassistant vice chancellor of
Business and Finance].”

university,” Hansen said. “We teach
and also advise the students. We
have films, seminars, conferences,
music and theatrical productions.”

The first planned event is sched-
uled for the end of November and
will feature exhibits on-current
research being done by Pitt women’s
studies faculty. There will also be a
keynote speaker.

Hansen said she hopes the studies
program will continue to gain atten-
tion.

“I think it provides a focus for
feminist accomplishment and sup-
port both for the faculty members
doing it and our students,”
she said. “Although there’s been
tremendous research on feminist
scholarship in the past 20 to 30
years, much of this has not penetrat-
ed some institutions. It’s a way to
make sure that the information is
available.” ‘

Vive la France

Just before the beginning of 1992, the 12—member
European Community agreed to create an economic
and monetary union with a common foreign policy that
would ensure European stability and prosperity into the
21st century. The Maastricht Treaty was the beginning
of a new era for Europe. It was to prove that countries
such as France, Germany and England could overlook
‘their differences and make Europeans feel united in a
way they never imagined. However, since the initial
euphoria, times have changed. The Treaty, which
requires unanimity on the part of the member states, in
order to take effect, has fallen on hard times. It was
narrowly-rejected in a June referendum by Denmark.

And as _recently as ‘Sunday it wagswapproved, by the 

smallest of marg_ins,§by the people of France.

-‘While’ it truly was intheirbest interests’ to approve 
Maastricht, the French vote raised some huge concerns -
about the future of Europe —-— the least of these con- .

cerns is the speed with which this Treaty takes effect.
After all, there is very little doubt as to whether or not
this pact could make life easier for all Europeans. The
). European Community has calculated that a single cur-
rency, rather than 11 different ones, will increase pro-
ductivity by five percent, decrease inﬂation and save
businesses $13 billion a year in foreign exchange costs.
With all of the benefits that Maastricht could bring,
one wonders why. it would be so difficult to get it
passed. The answer is simple — the citizens of France
were, in reality, not voting on the treaty. They were
voting on their national interests —- the cheese, the art,
the wine, the language — and on the threat of a
Europe dominated by Germany. A deep culture and
history, regardless of the benefits this treaty could
bring, justifies these fears. Ultimately, most Europeans

" will realize that the protection of their culture lies more

in a unified Europe than it does in a separated one. Just
look at the lessons from the former Yugoslavia.
National interests are supposed to be about security.
Ironically though, it is national interests that have creat-
ed uncertainty and the destruction of a country.

The European Community was created and has
grown as a result of the governments of the member
states". It was not created by some contine‘ntal—wide
European referendum. For the most part it has
remained above the realm of most Europeans minds,
}.ind» that is why the fear exists. The French‘ and Danish
referendums prove this fact and highlight the need for
more participation on the part of the people. In a world
where "destabilizing nationalism is an increasingly seri-
ous international problem, the right path to take, it
seems,'is the one which keeps historical hatreds and
nationalism in check. If allowed to be, Maastricht could
be that road.

NAFTA treaty provides hope for future

On September 18, President
Bush officially announced to
Congress the completion of the
North American Free Trade
Agreement (NAFTA).
agreement between the United

_States, Canada and Mexico

would remove tariffs and trade
barriers between the three
nations and establish the largest
free-trade zone in the world.

The pact will eliminate tariffs _

on nearly 10,000 products over
the next 15 years and will elim-
inate duties on farm products.
Whether or not to accept the
terms of the agreement will be
a hotly contested topic in the
coming months. Many see the
agreement as costing Amer-

icans thousands of jobs while

severely damaging the environ-
ment. While these arguments
may have some validity, they
overlook some very important
issues. _

Promoting greater free trade
with its Mexican and Canadian
partners, the United States will
save consumers money,
increase demand for American
products and help create jobs.
The American public now
spends about $75 billion a year
on import tariffs.

By eliminating such tariffs
with Canada and Mexico, two
of America’s largest trading
partners, costs to consumers
could be significantly reduced.
Consumers would have more
money to spend and invest,
thereby helping to promote
economic growth.

The eliminationof tariffs on‘

American products imported
into Canada and Mexico would
increase the demand for these
products and spur economic
growth. This would not only

This "

allow American companies to
become more competitive in
other markets but would also
allow them to expand and pro-
duce more — creating more
jobs here at home.

It has been predicted that the
elimination of duties on farm
products could increase
American agricultural exports
by as much as 30.percent, pro-
ducing a much—needed boost

Mike
Brittingham

for American farmers.

Critics of the agreement’

believe‘ that it will cost manu-
facturing jobs. They think that
companies will relocate to take
advantage of the lower wages
in Mexico.

Others contend ,that the

, agreement will cause severe

damage to the environment
due to more lenient environ-
mental laws in Mexico. While
these are legitimate concerns,
the actual severity of the
impact is questionable.

Though some jobs will cer-
tainly be lost, the increase in
demand for American products
will help to create more jobs in
the future. Also, -increased com-
petition and production in
Mexico may cause wages there
to rise — making relocating
less attractive. Many organiza-
tions, such as the
Environmental Defense Fund,
support NAFTA on the grounds
that ultimately, the environ-
mental conditions in Mexico
will be improved.

Though questions about the
possible effects on jobs and the
environment ‘are important,

another factor that may be
even more important for the
future of American economic
power -—; the growing trend
towards the creation of regional
trading blocs.

Though it has encountered set-
backs in recent weeks, the
European Comm—unity, which
consists of 12 Western
European nations (with talks of
expansion coming soon), will
undoubtedly continue its move
towards greater economic
unity.

There have also been moves
recently to create a’ trade bloc
in Southeast Asia, which
include some of the fastest
growing economies in the
world — such as Singapore
and Thailand.

These moves toward eco-
nomic unity will inevitably
increase the economic power
of these regions, resulting in
greater competition against the
United States. The creation of
its own trading bloc would
help the United States compete
among a world of economic
superpowers.

Should the United States take
part in NAFTA? A better ques-
tion is, will the United States be
able to keep up with a world
of multinational economic

powers? It is a simple question

of economic survival. In a
world of international econom-
ic superpowers, single nations
will have little chance of com-

peting. Only by combining our I

strengths can we possibly hope
to remain strong and prosper-
ous.

Pitt tries to avoid stumbling over the Rock

 play keys

By Brian Gallagher

Senior Staff Writer

Bring on the Rock!

Riding the momentum of a
four-game winning streak, the
Pitt soccer team returns to
action today with a 4 p.m. road
matchup against Slippery Rock
University.

The Panthers are perhaps hot
off their biggest win in Big East
history, a 3-2 shocker over
defending Big East champion
Seton Hall last Saturday. They
aim for a repeat of their ‘92

take-free defense, steady goal-
tending and opportunistic

the Rockets of the Rock.

The matchup between Pitt
and the Rockets, a Division II
squad with a 2-5, record overall,
is the 41st matchup of the
Western Pennsylvania foes. Pitt
won last year’s game at Pitt
Stadium, 5-0. The Panthers
head into the affair atop the
Big East soccer standings with
a perfect 3-0 mark. Their over-
all record stands at 4-2.

For Slippery Rock head

of regional squad‘ versus
national upstart is a game bet-

when Pitt is hitting all cylin-

“[Pitt] was underrated to start

Spz'tzer’s

soccer ’s
rise to top

By Bennett Zamoff
For The Pitt News

Ask anyone on the Pitt
soccer team why the
Panthers, who failed
to win a conference game
once last year, have
suddenly become the
“Beast of the Big East”
this season, and he will
talk about it being a
team effort.

He will point to last
year’s leading scorer,
Eric Prex, who is blasting
shots past opposing
L goaltenders once again.

He will point to the
nonstop hustle and solid
defense turned in by
Brian Pellegrino and
Cartsen Bishop. And he
will point to the leader-
ship and stellar play pro-
vided by senior captain
J.R. Purdue.

But he will also surely
point to one other young
man.

He may not spend 60
minutes a game hustling
up and down the field
with quite the same
intensity his teammates
have been showing,
but for a few frantic sec-
onds in every game he
has played, first-year-
student goalie Adam
Spitzer has been the most
important Panther on the
field.

Rockets with a "tandem of
defensive talent. Gillespie, a
junior stopper, was an All—Mid
Atlantic region performer in
‘91. Hale, an outside defender,
provides perimeter pressure on
opposing strikers.

Overall, the Rockets’ head
coach Jim Herlinger describes
his ‘92 team as a young, incon-

sistent soccer team. Ten of the
top 20 players on his roster are
either first-year athletes. or
transfer students. For Slippery
Rock to have any chance
against a blossoming power
such as Pitt, mistakes must be
at a minimum, and effort must
be at full-blown maximum out-
put.

‘ “If we come out ready, it’ll

‘be a decent game,” Hurlinger

said. “There’s a lot of tradition
between these two schools.”

As with non-league games
earlier in the season against

. Geneva College and California

[Pa.] State, the clash provides
the Panthers with yet another
of those “weaker” opponents

between the games against the
eastern powers of the Big East.
Pitt follows the Rock game with
another conference showdown
this Sunday at home against
Villanova. 1

Luxbacher, the roller coaster

as any member of this

Ham’ work of Pitt football players not reflected in wins and losses

Who said that hard work pays off?

Tell that to the 119 Pitt football play-
ers who, in one way or another, dedi-
cate their lives to football but have lit-
tle to show while playing in a Panther
uniform. ' '

Regardless of who is to be blamed
for Pitt’s losing record over the past
three years (10-14-1), it seems that the

players’ good performances and dedi-

cation to the game are being over-
looked. V

Some people might say that the play-
ers don’t play like they care. Well they
have to care.

Spending 20 hours a week at practice
and carrying a full load of classes,
these players rarely have spare time
for themselves. ‘

And going away to camp to work out

for two weeks in the hot August heat

to prepare forthe upcoming season is
also something the normal person
doesn’t do when he doesn’t care.

But why isn’t all the blood and sweat
from all this strenuous labor paying
off? No one is sure. But with every
game the team loses,
you can be sure that

for anything positive or any of the hard
work to shine through — like the play
of junior strong safety Doug Whaley,
who plays hard every down regardless
of the score.

Whaley has a nose for the ball, and‘

you can tell just by
watching him play. It

every player feels hor-
rible.

Losing is not accept-
able for these players.
Instead, winning is a
must. Besides the four

, Klirnis

seems that whenever
a tackle is made, he’s
right in the middle of
things.

W h a 1 e y
doesn’t leave his

or five very special ,
and lucky players who will make it to
the pros, college football on a Division
I level is all most have to play for.
With all the negative feelings that
have been looming over the team’s

accomplishments on
‘the field. In the classroom, Whaley has
a G.P.A. over 3.00 and was a GTE
District. II Academic All-American last
year. _

Another bright spot on the team is

head for the past few weeks, it’s:-.._h_ard- the performance of sophomore run-

ning back Curtis Martin. His second
efforts on every run always earn him
extra yardage.

It will be hard to forget his
performance against West Virginia.
Martin gained 107 yards on a day
Pitt could only score six points. .

The beauty of Martin’s runs was
that he probably gained half of the
yards on his own, darting-through tack-
les and constantly making defenders
miss.

Martin suffered an ankle injury in the‘

game against Rutgers and hopefully he
will be able to return to the gridiron
shortly.

A wa1k—on last season, Doug Kautter
is a fine addition to Pitt’s special teams.
A junior, Kautter barely sees playing
time. But when he’s on the field his

powers and regional Division II
rivals back-to-back can be trou-
blesome — if a team looks past
the assumed win and thinks
about the next Big East
matchup.

“It can be a problem  if we
let it be a problem,” Luxbacher
said. “If you’re mentally ready,

.it shouldn’t matter who you

play. But sometimes, no matter
how much [you warn them],
they oftentimes tend to not

I look upon a non—conference

game with the same intensity.
“If we let [that] happen, it’s a
problem.” 8
Another who agrees with the
whole “not—looking-past” theo-

ry is Panthers’ defender Carsten
Bishop. He says that while
there is reason to be confident
and happy at the shining start
to the year, there’s no looking
past the pebble—like Rock —
that has the capability to beat a
team like Pitt if not taken seri-
ously.

Already this year, Bishop and
Pitt have felt the wrath of such

small schools — losing to
California [Pa.] State and
Bucknell.

“Since we’re 1-2 [out of the
conference], all of these little
ones are starting to worry me,”
Bishop said. “There’s maybe
not the same urgency [as in Big
East games]  [to compete] —

it’s a little more relaxed [atti-
tudel.”

On the league—leading
Panthers’ early good fortune,
Bishop attributes the success to
a blend of talent and hard
work, combined with a little
luck.

“The ball’s bouncing the right
way [this Yearl,” Bishop said.
“Last year with St. John’s and a
few other games, we lost 
but it was bad luck [as much as
anything]. ’

“[This year], after winning
those two big ones, anything’s
possible.”

While luck may have some-
thing to do with a goal here, or
a save there, it’s more a matter

The success of Bishop and
company is a simple equation
of good players working
together, according to Pitt’s
ninth-year head coach who is
quietly pleased with the efforts
of his team so far.

“In general, we just have a
good mix of players,”
Luxbacher said.

“[This year], we have certain
players that play certain
roles —— guys that are workers
and ball-winners and
guys [that] are more skilled.
They’re a good bunch of guys.

play is hard to miss. A
starter on kickoffs, kick
returns and the goal-line
defense, he makes his rare
appearances known.

Charging down the field
on kickoffs, Kautter is in a
search-and—destroy mode
— looking for someone to
hit and to ‘crush the ball
carrier.

Kautter’s hard work
paid off this season when
he was awarded with a
scholarship.

These players are not
the only bright spots on
the team. But their hard,
determined play“ is needed
on a team that sometimes
looks like it is surrender-
ing to itsopponents.

Other players, like
Lex Perkins, Dietrich
Jells, Charles Williams
and Jermaine‘ Williams are
also a joy to watch.

This team is not lacking
stars, but it is desperately
missing wins.

With all the talented
players, there is no reason
why this team should not
win more games. But now
it has to be the team that
pulls itself together —— not
the coaches or the fans or
anyone else for that mat-
ter.

With the team going
nowhere, it is now time
for the players toiquit
playing for their coach
and to start playing for
themselves.

When this happens, Pitt
fans will get to see the
true football team on the
field — and the wins will

THE PI’IT NEWS, Wednesday, September 23, 1992

Spitzer

Continued from page 7
with them into today’s match-up with
Slippery Rock.

Spitzer’s ‘success is even more
incredible when one takes into
account that the man starting in goal
now for the Panthers is first-year stu-
dent.

“I knew Adam was a good player,”
Pitt Coach Joe Luxbacher said.

“But sometimes freshmen don’t
always play up to their abilities
because it’s a big change — not just
soccer but going away to school, the
whole bit. But he was thrown in and
he responded when we needed him,
and he’s been getting better every
game.”

Being “thrown in” means Spitzer
was asked to come in cold off the
bench to start the second half in the
Panthers’ second game this year
against Bucknell.

The Panthers lost the game, but
Spitzer was impressive in defeat, shut-

ting out Bucknell for the entire half.
He got the call to start Pitt’s next two
games the following weekend.

The Morganville, New Jersey native
didn’t disappoint. He helped lead
the Panthers to their first Big
East victories in over a year that
weekend —- a 3-1 drubbing of
Providence and then a 1-0 shutout of
Boston College — and took home Big
East Defensive Player of the Week
honors for his efforts.

Spitzer hasn’t seen time on the pine
since — posting a perfect record of 4-
O as Pitt’s starting netminder.

The early success for the first year
player comes as a bit of a surprise for
him, but he’s certainly more than
happy with it.

“I didn’t know what to expect when
I came in,” Spitzer said.

“I was just hoping to make a differ-
ence. I’m sure that’s what the other
freshmen were thinking too. We were
hoping we could turn it around a little

bit, and so far we've turned it around
more than expected, which is lucky
for us.”

Coach Luxbacher points to the
Boston College game as the one in
which Spitzer truly showed his true
talents in goal.

“At BC is when he really came into
his own,” Luxbacher said. “He made
some great saves  no doubt about it.
He kept us in the game, and the
longer we were in the game, the bet-
ter we got. He was the difference
there.”

Pitt goaltending coach Dave
Torrence agrees that Spitzer has
shown that he is a gifted goalie.

“We knew he was a good goaltender
when he came in,” Torrence said. “We
definitely knew he could play  he’s
living up to the potential we felt he
had when he came in.”

One thing Spitzer’s emergence has
done is take playing time away
from Pitt’s other goaltender, Kirk

Browdows.

Coach Luxbacher feels that the
junior from Summit, New Jersey is
equally up to the task of filling the
Panther nets.

“Kirk’s a tough kid, and he works
hard, and he’s capable too. We’re
solid in goal,” Luxbacher said.

Actually, Spitzer says that the com-
petition he shares with Browdows for
the starting job is a positive thing.

“It’s good ‘cause he keeps up the
competition against me so I don’t
slack off at all,” Spitzer said. “He’s
always working hard.”

But Coach Luxbacher knows
that Spitzer’s play has been
instrumental in the Panthers’

turnaround this season and has
named Spitzer his man, at least for
now.

And if this one first-year student
continues to shine in goal, the Pitt soc-
cer team could be in for one incredi-
ble fall.
