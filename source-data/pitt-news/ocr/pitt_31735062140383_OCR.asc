1932: "Swamps of thePhiIippines"'

By JACK dc BENEDICTIS

20: Women's‘ elections, Mili-.

The Board of Deans met
three times  one week, Jan-
uary 28, February 2 and Feb-
ruary 4, to work on the wartime
program.

Mr. Fitzgerald declined to com-
ment concerning the exact date that
trimester plans would be announc-
ed. but he indicated that the cur-
riculum would be adopted provid-
ing all details can be arranged.

University oﬂicials maintained
that the only main obstacle to the
adoption of the program is the
ﬁnancial one. Possibility of Con-
gressional subsidation of univer-
sities before April 15 is dimming,
they said.

N a t i o n a 1 appropriation for
schools adopting a scholastic
“‘speed-up” program was expect-
ed to balance the income defi-
ciencies. _

In some other colleges a tri-
mester plan has been adopted, but

at other schools it is still indeﬁ-

nite.

Dartmouth College: Doubt/and
uncertainty ‘in minds of entire stu-
dent body as to what steps the
Administration is going to take.
Students feel that a 13 week stretch
of work without official interrup-
tion would be less eﬂicient, less
healthy, and less workable.

Alabmnol Polytechnic Institute:
New quarter system to start June
1. ‘

St. Vincent College: Saturday
classes and summer term adopted.
Saturday classes will reduce sem-
ester by two weeks and advance
graduation date, while summer
term, which extends from June I
to August 28, will make it pos-
sible to obtain a degree in three
years.

Penn State: 58 per cent of stu-
dent body answer “yes” to ques-
tionnaire concerning trimester
plan, 9 per cent answer “no,” and
33 per cent answer undecided.

University of North Carolina:
Summer term plan goes through.

Ball and Indiana State Teach-
ers College: Academic calendar
revised enabling students to ob-
tain degrees in appyoximately three
years.

University of Texas: Speed-up
program optional. University gear-
ed 'to provide graduation within
thirty—two months.

MacArthur, the defender of the
Philippines, aﬁd a military man if
there ever was one, spoke in Pitt
stadium to the June graduating
class that year, 1932, and said,
“Only those are ﬁt to ‘live who are

‘not afraid to die.”-

, From the tone of this speech
MacArthur was certainly the man
to place in charge of the almost
hopeless position in the Philip-
pines. For he believed in the “bio-
logical character of war,” and he
believed in preparedness at a time
when defense measures were 
ebb tide. ’
F 1' instance MacArt

hur said,‘

achieved for us by armed men.”

.And he foresaw war “as the
necessity of national, defense is
sacriﬁced in the name of economy,
the United States presents a
tempting spectacle.” To the Jap-

anese? “It is a temptation which

may ultimately lead to the align-
ments neeessary for another world
war. . . . ”

MacArthur believed that pa-
ciﬁcism was “like a mist before
the faces of America” and he de-
voted much of his speech to com-
bat it, when in reality what held

' up adequate defense was the iso-
’ lationist hangtbver from the last

wars.

 

, Fifty-two tuition-free de-
fense training courses in en-
gineering, science,‘ and man-
agement, sponsored by the
United States oﬁice of educa-
tion, will bepoffered by the

University beginning February 25. ‘

Senior women will be given ﬁrst
choice in registering. Registration
for others, February 18 to 21.

At an open meeting for senior
women Wednesday at 1:30 o'clock
in 132 Cathedral, Dr. Mary E.

give them special training for jobs

The minimum requirement for
all courses is graduation from high
school or equivalent. Prerequisites
vary according to the course.

Although all courses are on a.
college level and the student will
be rated on his work, no college
credit‘ will be granted. The em-
phasis in all courses is on imme-
diate practical app\lic’ations.

All classes will begin the week
of February 23 and continue for
-sixteen weeks. Classes in general
will be conducted two nights per
week, three to four hours a night.

Courses will end the week of June

' pitt’s typical girl

Wanted: Typical Pitt .Girl

0 Brosky Seeks Character ‘Sketches

The “typical Pitt girl” will be
featured in a character sketch in
the 1942 Owl, John Brosky, C42,
said today. Brosky has asked men
to submit a character sketch, of
their impression of the “typical
Pitt girl” in a sealed envelope to
the Owl oﬂice, 803 Cathedral, by
Friday of this week.

Defense priorities rulings which
prevented the Owl staff from ob-
taining material have caused the
cancellation of an Owl sales booth
in the ground floor elevator lobby,
Don Lingenfelter, assistant circu-
lation manager said today.

A deposit on the yearbook also

A salesman will be available,
however, in the ground ﬂoor lob-
by every afternoon this week and
students may make the $1 deposit

on the $3.50 total price of the 1942
yearbook at that time, Lingenfel-
ter stated.

Brosky announced that the Owl

to undergraduates and their activi-

‘ties than any previous book had

uate yearbooks sold prove it.

conflict can not be eradicated
through institutions, but only
through the reform of the individ-

task which has baffled the highest

He also mentions “our cherish-
ed nationalistic ideals,” the “gos-
pel of preparedness and national-

In asimple fracture the bone is

wound from the break in the bone _

to the skin.

In a compound fracture the
bone is broken, and in addition
there is a wound from the’ break
to the surface of the’ skin.

Until. a physician arrives, the
first aim in a simple fracture is to
prevent» further damage. Improper
handling may cause the sharp ends
of the bone-to in-jure nervesand

’muscles,. cut through blood ves-
sels, or even pierce the skin, thus
producing a compound fracture.

Make the patient comfortable,
treat any shock that may be ‘pres-
ent, and "prevent more from de-
veloping. Keep him warm and give
him stimulants, if "needed. | .'

Do not transport the patient,
even for a very short distance be-
fore splints have been applied.

Fixed traction is the ideal first
aid treatment for fractures. This
is traction on the end of a limb‘
pulling "against a. fixed point at the
base of the limb where it joins the
body, by means of apparatus like
the Thomas splint and its various
modiﬁcations. «

This is used only for fractures
of the arm or leg. Make no at-
tempt to put the limb in a normal
position without being ready‘ to
continue traction until‘~the necs-
sary splints are applied.

In the case of compound frac-
tures, if arterial bleeding is pres-
ent, checkit byﬁhandpressure be-
tween the wound and the ‘heart,
then apply ‘a tourniquet.

If there is no arterial bleeding,
always place a. tourniquet loosely
around the limb, so that if ar-
terial bleeding should start, the
tourniquet can be tightened

The Geneva Covenanters aveng-

:; ed an early season Stadium setback
: last Saturday evening when they_

caught ‘the hot and cold ‘Panther

nights, and sent them back to
Pittsburgh with a 54-42 blot on

The victory enabled the ,/Geneva

~« intact, marking their sixth-straight

upheld the Covenanters role of
“giant: killers” and gave the Gold
and White a victory over all three
Pittsburgh schools as Duquesne
and Carnegie Tech had previously
fallen’ victims to the Ransom-
coached machine. _
Charles 'D.evenz_io, Geneva for-

ahead on a pair of foul conver-

tied the score at 3-3 and it was
tied again at 4-4 and 6-6 before
the Covenanters forged ahead on
two baskets by Devenzio and one

Dy BETTY McMAHAN
About a month ago a German
"U-boat commander somewhere in
the north Atlantic heard a New
—;York- weather broadcast. He heard

that a large storm was passing-
fthrough Minnesota and would

strike the eastern seaboard within
“ a few days with snow and bitter

c - cold weather.

Using a little knowledge of me-
teorology in ﬁguring how long it
would take the storm to reach his
position, the commander knew it
would be followed by two or three
days of clear cold weather.

Ship after ship of valuable car-

go for England went down when

__ that weather he had predicted ar-

rived. Soon after, the United States

‘government requested that no

’.weather reports be broadcast or
printed, with the simple explana-
tion that they were an aid to the
bnemy.

. That incident is just one graphic
example of how a little knowledge
of meteorology and the types of
weather that preceed and follow
air masses can aid in winning or
losing a war.

Students at the University can
obtain the fundamentals of that
knowledge by taking a course of-
fered for the ﬁrst time last spring,
“Elements of Meteorology,” taught
by Donald C. Bradford, Seismol-

: . . Vogist.

This semester 76 men of draft
age and two women are taking the
course which is ‘scheduled in three
sections. Section 1 is taught on
Tuesdays and Thursdays, fourth
hour in 304 Cathedral, section 2,
«Tuesday evening, 7:45-9:45 o’clock

- in 227 Cathedral, and section 3,

Monday, ﬁfth hour and Wednesday

,, 1.2- 4- ’

eteorology   Course

sixth hour in 206 Cathedral.

The course is without prere-
quisites and is an elementary one
from which a student would be
able to go on to more advanced
meteorology. But, Mr. Bradford
states, some knowledge of physics
and math would aid the student
considerably. . /

A few speciﬁc usesto which
knowledge of meteorology is put
in the army are weather forecasts
for bombing attacks, control of
artillery ﬁre, and air navigation.
-The same applies to the navy with
the additional use ofiprediction of
visibility for convoys.

A brie'f resume of the course in-
cludes the study of temperature,
pressure, humidity, wind, conden-
sation of moisture in the air, adia-
batic effects which concerns the
expansion and cooling of a free
body of gas, and the principles of
air mass analysis. ,

An air mass is identiﬁed by its

constant temperature and humid-
-“ity, according to Mr. Bradford. Un-
til a few years ago, air mass an-
alysis was just a theory, but one
that was revolutionizing meter-
ology from a weather-guessing busi-
ness to a science, the physics of
the air. 7'

Formerly all weather predicting
was done by comparing high and
low pressure areas and was inac-
curate at best. Since the advance-
ment and development of the air
mass analysis theory, weather in
front of the air mass and behind
it can be accurately foretold. As
an indication of the moderness of
this method, only last August the
weather bureau of the United
States switched to the air mass an-
alysis method.

Civil Service Official
To Interview Seniors

J. T. Risen of the Pittsburgh of- -

ﬁce of the Civi-lService commission,
will interview seniors and receive

applications. Wednesday afternoon
in 821 Cathedral.

The purpose of his visit is to an-
swer any questions which_ students
may, have on opportunities for
them with the government, Law-
rence Irwin, director of the Univer-
sity placement bureau explained.
Applications do not obligate the

Civil Service i 
Requirementsi

Are Modified

The ‘Civil Service commission an-
nounced last week that it not only
is accepting appications for all
grades and branches of engineer-
.ing, but that examinations for ap-

pointments as junior engineer have ~

been modiﬁed so that none requires
a written test.

For the junior‘ grades, at a sal-
ary of $2,000 yearly, applicants
are rated on only their engineer-
ing education, no experience be-
ing required. For some positions,
certain college courses other than
the usual engineering studies may
also be accepted if supplemented,
by appropriate defense training
courses.

Chemical‘ -engineers, especially
those experienced in specialized
branches of plastics, rubber, and
strategic materials, will receive
from $2,600 to $5,600 per ye-ar. Na-
val architects and all other branch-

es ofengineering will receive the

same salary.

The commission further lists po-
sitions open as technical assistant
engineers for persons having at
least three years of a four—year
college, and including courses in
mathematics, physics, and allied en-
gineering subjects. Salaries are
$1,800.
