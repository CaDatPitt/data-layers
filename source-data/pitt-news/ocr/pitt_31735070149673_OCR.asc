  Eighth graders come  
to Pitt for College Day

By Nate Kreicliman
Staﬁ” Writer ‘

The National Societyof Colle-
giate Scholars gave middle school’
students a taste of college life on
Wednesday as part of the group’s

’ annual March to College Day.

Fifty eighth graders from the
Barack Obama Academy of Inter-
national Studies in East Liberty
were treated to campus tours, mo-
tivational speeches, performances,
a mock lecture and presentations
on student groups and studying
abroad during the day.—long event
at Pitt.

Darlene Epps, a counselor at

the visiting school and a Eitt alum— ‘
, nus, said the students were chosen

from,a class of about 130 based
on teacher recommendations and
academics. . g -

“The ultimate goal of March to
College Day is to familiarize ‘the
students with what college life is
going to be,” Epps said. “It’s an
opportunity tovisit the campus
[and] actually see the students in
their own world  Their eyes are

opened up to what college life is ’

going to be about  having that
‘opportunity to go to campusand

really see ﬁrsthand what actually
goes on.” i .

Derilyn Devlin, vice president
of NSCS’s Planning to Achieve Col-
legiate Excellence program, said
that when she ﬁrst organized the
event, she was surprised by the
middle schoolers’ attentiveness
and maturity. ,

“I was thinking, ‘This is going to
be total chaos, they’re going to be
running all over and just excited to
have a day off from school,”’ Dev-
lin said. “I was bl6wn‘away.‘They

‘ came prepared with questions 

They were like, ‘Oh, I was wonder-
ing about tuition and'applying.’
They thought about it before they
came  They really were looking
forward to it.” .

. The students wereequally in-
volved this year, listening carefully
and asking questions to all of the
speakers. _ p _

“I learned alot about college life
and the things that you do at col-
lege and what college has to offer,”

from the North Side. V

A Pitt music professorwill see her study abroad
program off on its maiden voyage this sum-
mer. ‘ '

After a conversation with her travel-agent
mother two years ago, Adriana Helbig began
concocting plans for pitchingthe Romani Mu-
sic, Culture and Human Rights study abroad

_ program to the University.

‘ Pitt approved‘ the ﬁrst—o-f-its-kind study
abroad program, which focuses on the culture
of Romanis, commonly referred to as gypsies.
Helbigwill take 12 Pitt students on the two-and-
a-half week Panther Program this May.

For Helbig, the issue of the role of the Roma

community in EasternEurope is a “hot topic” .

politically, socially and musically. She said she
thinks it’s pertinent to all students in that it can
serve as a “wake-up call,” encouraging aware-
ness of the substandard conditions of Roma

   

 

.. age
neighborhoods throughout Europe.‘

“It’s a growing experience, and all of the
students that are going are extremely passion—_
ate,” Helbig said. “The trip will pull the rug
out from the experiences they may have had
abroad before.”

While the application deadline has hit for

this summer, the Study Abroad Office will

continue to offer the program, which costs-

$3,85b for in—state students and $4,050 for
out-of-state students, next May. ' .

On May 26, the students will leave for
Prague in the Czech Republic and get their
ﬁrst taste of Romani music at the Khamoro
World Roma Festival before continuing on to
three other cities. 

~“This Khamoro Festival is a very positive
attempt to create an identity and reinforce a
sense of pride among Europe’s most discrimi-
nated group of people,” Helbig said. '

While in the Czech Republic, Helbig said

'the group will combine with a group of Czech ~

students led by Zuzanajurkové of Charles Uni-

versity in Prague.

After leaving the Czech Republic, Helbig
said students will “engage in Roma Holocaust
history” by traveling to Poland. While in the

‘country, Helbig said students will tour a Ro-
_ mani museum in Tarkow as well as Auschwitz,

a former Nazi concentration camp. ‘ ‘
Finally, Helbig said the Pitt and Charles
University students will -have,the opportunity

' to take day trips into urban and rural Roma

communities in Kosice in eastern Slovakia.

‘ Pitt sophomore Lisa Wojciechowicz origi-
nally became interested inthe program through
Helbig’s Gypsy ‘Music class. After attending a

Romani music symposium last year, she de— l

cided to participate in the study abroad.
“I would say that besides the music festival,
[1 look forward to] meeting and interactingwith
Romani in Slovakia,” Wojciechowicz said.
Vera Sebulsky, manager of the program from

Pitt’s Center for Russian and Eastern European‘

 

ice introduces new Pcmthr Prommg

Studies, said the two—year process to geta study
abroad program approved includes approval
from ~Pitt’s legal department and approval as
an actual course from the University. .

Students participatingin the tripwill receive
three credits. I r 4 V "

Sebulsky said that along with helping to
organize the trip, she also plans to travel with
the students this summer.

“I’ll be making sure that students’ are safe
and keeping contact with their parents so that
the professor: is able to focus on teaching,”
Sebulsky said.

Helbig, an ethnomusicologist, said her ﬁeld
of study focuses on the relation between mu-
sic and society as well as cultural processes in

' relation to musical expression. She said this

new study abroad program promotes those
relationships.

“You’re looking at musical processes as
they interact with the broader sociopolitical
perspectives,” Helbig said. H - '

“You can be ‘
whatever you’re ’
willing to work for.”
‘ A— Penny Semaia

into the William Pitt Union ballroom to hear a
motivational speech from former Pitt football
player Penny Semaia —— now Pitt’s assistant
athletic director for student life and a celeb-
rity as far as the kids were concerned.
Semaia touched on his listeners’ potential,
encouraging them to’ reach for their goals.

But it was not all unicorns and rainbows. —

More than anything else, Semaia stressed
personal responsibility. He said that in the
real world, it’s'not that you can be whatever

you want to be, rather, “You can be whatever , V

you’re willing to workfor.”
Semaia was followed by a step perfor-

mance by members of the Alpha Phi Alpha '

fraternity. The kids started taking pictures
and recording videos before the group be-

‘gan. More than a few ran up front after the

steppers offered a second routine, which
was followed by a brief question-and-answer
session with the fraternity members-about
college and Greek life. '

One Pitt student performer reiterated
Semaia’s message of responsibility, saying,
about fun later.” i "4 .' l . ._

Next up was a mock lecture by Pitt com-
munications professor Matt Gayetsky, who
weighed the pros and cons of new and old

“We take care of our books ﬁrst and worry

media. During his speech, Gayetsky was half ‘ '

teacher and half entertainer, showing the

students popular video clips and Internet

memes. . ' '
In the end, Gayetsky concluded that the

medium is the message;-new media is not

better or worse, but different.
At ﬁrst glance, it seemed the professor

had modiﬁed his lesson plan for a younger .

audience; But he said he includes similar
entertainment elements in his college lec-
tures as well. — .
_ When one young girl compared getting
news on the Internet to streaming movies on
N etﬂix, Gayetsky jumped up and exclaimed,
“That’s a really ‘good observation.”

The professor also praised.’ the event.’

“It’s a unique opportunity to try to bridge
the breadth of the things you can do at Pitt

_ with students whomight be-afraid of what

college means,” he said.
- Likewise, Epps said she thinks the pro-

gram is very helpful to the students that -

come each year.

“I have tremendous admiration for the’
National Society of Collegiate Scholars. They
have been so instrumental in keeping this
going  I’m just so happy that they continue
to work with us.” Epps said.-‘

The groups usuallyrepresent a widevariety
of styles and genres and are evaluated by
three judges —-— orie Pitt student and two
local musicians.

' Last year’s winner, Legs Like Tree Trunks,
got to open for Ke$ha at last spring’s Bigelow
Bash, but the reigning champs will not make ’
a second appearance in the battle.this year
as winning bands are barred from compet-
ing again. ' . '

Instead, Legs Like Tree Trunks frontman
Matt Holden will serve as one of the judges
at this year’s contest. And when it comes to

his judging criteria, it’s simple.
' “I’m looking for people having fun, and

_bands pushing the envelope,” he said. ‘

Holden sees the Battle of the Bands as a
great way for Pitt ‘students to get introduced

. to local artists.

“If yeuﬁnd a band you like that’s from
your area, you can see them once a weekend
instead of once a year,” Holden said. .

Sophomore Eric Matthew Silverman, the
singer and guitarist for the student band
Too Young, will face the judges tonight. The
Battle of the Bands will be only the fourth
show that Too Young has performed. Silver-
man said that the band normally plays in
Shadysideor Bloomﬁeld.

He said the Battle of the Bands -is a way

to get Pitt students excited about musicians ‘

s

around campus. ’
' “Pittsburgh has a great local music

scene,” Silverman said. “It’s a great com-

munity for students to venture into.”

Alana Miller, a member of Pitt Program
Council and the organizer of the event, called
the Battle of the Bands, “a great opportu-
nity for Pitt’s campus to showcase student
talent.”

“Pitt students should come out and ap-
preciate the talent that the University has
to offer and support the bands,” Miller
said. “Whatever band wins gets to open for
a Billboard-chart-topping band. It doesn’t
get much better than thatﬁ’ I P

One day in the not—too-distant
future, you’re going to wake up
feelingiold as hell. You’ll con-
ﬁrm that feeling with‘ a glimpse
in the mirror, whereupon you’ll
discover your belly’s a little too
big, your heinie’s just a touch too
wide, and your hairline’s just a
shade too high. What, 'then, are
you to do about this sorry state
of affairs?

Beforeyou rushoutandspend

I a fortune on Rogaine, Botox and
a gym membership, consider-

the many advantages your fallen
condition affords, For the first
time in your life, you’re com-

. pletely washedup. R ardless\of

how high your peak ,you’ve
already reached it and are now

attractive and cool as you’re ever
going to get. ~

' OK, you’re probably saying
to yourself, this still sounds ter-
rible. Here’s the thing, man: The
pressure is off. Nobody would
ever expect a 25-year-old former
bro with a beer belly or a du-

dette trying on her ﬁrst pair of A

mom jeans to do anything that’s
the least bit interesting. In other
words, you’ve ﬁnally been freed
from those familial pressures of
“making it,” of “succeeding,” of
becoming a person that anyone
in his or her right mind would
respect or admire. For the ﬁrst
time, you’re just you —- plain,
uninteresting, .not—anything-
like—Justin Bieber you —— and
you can spend therest of your
life chillaxing, kvetching and
daydreaming about what might
have been if you’d just caught a
few breaks here and there.

That’s right: Now that you’re -

a decrepit mid—twentysome—

story for yourself not

of these inane
spectacles.

W h i l e
you’re here, ‘i
why not try
a little myth-
making on for
size? Let’s start with your
career as a notorious “par—

’ty animal”:

What actually happened:
You drank a few cans of
Old Milwaukee,’ got tipsy,~
passed outjin your futon

commode after waking up at

wake up until seven weeks later.

And we mustn’t forget your
stellar athletic career:

What actually happened: You

your high school’s junior Varsity

nior year. At some point during

missed a game.

How to maintain a long-distance relationship

By Sarah Reagle
Columnist

  

Whether it’s your ﬁrst year at col-
lege and you’re losing touch with
high school friends or it’s your
last year and you’re losing touch
with recently graduated friends,
long-distance relationships can
easily ﬁzzle out. But you don’t
have to lose contact with people
completely. Unlike romantic rela-
tionships —- seriously, how many
movies, TV shows and real-life
anecdotes do we need to teach
us not to fall prey to the LDR? —-—
friendships can withstand some
distance.

When you’re in a long-distance
friendship, you need to make
some adjustments and put in
some extra effort. The ﬁrst step is
to realize that you and your friend
won’t have the same relationship
as when you lived near one an-
other. This doesn’t mean that you
can’t still be good friends or even
BFFs, but it’s impossible to main-
tain exactly the same dynamic.
You can’t replicate it by spending
all your time on the phone or on
Skype, and nobody wants to do
that anyway. S

If you’re looking to maintain
a long-distance friendship, here
_are some suggestions.

Make your own rules

Find what works for you and
your friend. If sending a text
every few days and a call every
couple weeks keeps you close
enough, that’s great. If you need
to call every few days, do that.
Just ﬁnd a balance that works,
and don’t let anyone else make
you feel like you talk too much or
too little.

When the time comes, make
sure you adjust the rules as need-
ed. If there are some weeks when
you really need a friend, let the
long-distance friend know. If
there are busy weeks where you
need some time to yourself, let
him or her know that too. Be ﬂex—.
ible.

Use different modes of commu-
nication S

The number of communica-
tion channels available to us —
Phones, text messages, FaceTime,
Facebook, Gchat, email, Skype,
etc. — can seem overwhelming,
but it can also be helpful. Using
different modes of communi-
cation leaves space for accom-
modation in your long-distance
friendship. If you can’t call, send
an email. If you really miss your
friend’s face, get on Skype. But
these alternative methods also
spice up what can become an oth-

erwise mundane LDF.
Talking on the phone all the

time can be super boring» —.

sometimes you just devolve into
discussing what you ate for lunch
or all the online shopping you did
that day. Another problem with
phone calls is actually syncing up
your schedules. There areesome
weeks when it just doesn’t come
together. So it’s nice to be able to
switch it up. ‘

Instead of calling, write let-
ters. This is a great idea for sev-
eral reasons: Everyone loves re-
ceiving letters, writing them is
therapeutic, buying stationery is
really ﬁm and you’re helping sup-

port a dying art. (Thetradition 1
of handwritten letters isleaving"

our generation, and with it goes
part of my soul.) Plus it makes for
great gift-giving opportunities.
Maybe my long-distance BFF is
fed up with me buying her letter-
related gifts for every holiday, but
that won’t stop me from continu-
ing to do so. Who doesn’t need a
personalized signet ring?

If writing letters is too slow
for you, try email. Emailing is a
less cool but far faster form of
writing. It allows you to share ex-
cellent stories instantly instead
of bottling them up for the next
time you get to talk on the phone.
Send long emails every few days

or short emails once every day.
Do what feels right.

Visit as often as possible

Make sure you actually visit
each other. Obvious advice, right‘?
But actually setting aside the time
to do so ends up being harder
than you’d think. Pick a week-
end, and commit to it. It’ll seem
like a chore to ignore homework
and skip work, but it’ll be worth
it. It’s nice to remind each other
why you’re friends in the ﬁrst
place, and there’s no better way

,...to do this than to-see one another

face-to-face. ’ A
This is when youcan catch up

' on the really great stories and

meet your friend’s new friends
who will always be inﬁnitely in-
ferior to you — but are probably
still pretty awesome. With any
luck, you’ll even get to visit a new

city.

Take more photographs

This advice works in both
directions. Take more pictures
when you’re'with the friend so
you can keep some memories on
hand — it’s nice to have some
framed photos around to remind
you that you have good friends
when you’re feeling down. But
you should also take more photos
when you’re apart.

If you have pictures from your
adventures away from each other,
sharing stories is easier and way
more fun. It also helps you re-
member what you’ve done since
the last time you talked.

Try using Instagram if you
have an iPhone or tweet pictures
for some instant sharing. It’s a
great way to feel connected even
if you don’t have direct contact
for a day or so. 

Accept changes as they come —

This is important: Relation-
ships change. Sometimes you’ll
ﬂoat apart when one or both
of your schedules are busy, but
don’t take it personally. Don’t
get mad if your friend cancels a
week’s worth of phone dates and
hope that he or she won’t get mad
if you have to do the same. We’re
busy people. i

It can get really difficult to
keep up a long-distance friend-
ship, but as long as you reconnect
after the busy time passes, all is
well. If you keep ﬂoating apart,
try to reconnect. Make the effort
to keep the LDF you had before. If
that doesn’t work, let it go. Don’t
burn bridges. You’ll come back
together when you need to. I _

CMU film fesi los at ‘Other’ in selectio

Carnegie Mellon
International Film
Festival I
March 22 to April 15
wwvv. cmu.edu/faces

By Anna Weldon
Senior Staﬁ‘ Writer

Every year, the Carnegie Mellon
International Film Festival has a
new “face.” .

The collaboration between
CMU and Pitt kicks off its sev-
enth year with this installment’s
theme, “Faces of Others.” The 16
featured ﬁlms from all around
the globe will embody the theme
that director Jolanta Lion said
highlights the humanistic aspect
of the event, rather than a gen-
eral topic.

“It emphasizes the focus on the
individual. It puts a human face on
very global issues,” Lion said.

The concept of “Other” has a
variety of meanings, all of which
stem from personal percep-
tion. Someone who ‘is separate,
a ‘stranger, is considered to be an
“Other,” and this take onthe term
easily falls in line with the interna-
tional perspective of the festival.

To be presented at various lo-
cations throughout the city, this
year’s festival contains 16 ﬁlms

Bands hope to revive local music scene with first South llaklaml Music Festival

By Anna-Weldon
Senior Staff Writer

Thirty years ago, Big Sean would
not be the only live act coming

' to Oakland in the spring. A large

group of local and national acts
made their rounds through the
neighborhood, stopping at bars
and clubs in the area.

This Saturday, The Hideout will
host South Oakland Fest, an event

featuring a set of four local indie
bands — Dazzletine, White Like
Fire, Sleepy V and Matt Koenig -
in an attempt to resurrect a once-
thriving Oakland music scene.

The Oakland community had
a very popular music scene dur-
ing the ’8os and ’90s, but as the
neighborhood evolved, many of
the formerly booming venues be-
gan to lose followers.

Manny Theiner, the organizer
of Saturday’s event, remembers

when Oakland residents fre-
quented places such as Club Laga.
Previously located in the space of
the present—day IGA and upstairs

apartment complex, Club Laga
hosted many bands in its heyday.

“Imagine [the IGA supermar-
ket] as a 750-capactiy club with
dancing and live music every
night,” he said.

Other venues have also been
turned into more mainstream cor-
porations. T-Mobile replaced The
Beehive, another past location for
bands, and several record stores
that used to inhabit South Oakland
closed their doors. -

 

For some time, Oakland was the
center of Pittsburgh’s music scene.
It was where everything happened,
from shows to house parties, until

the beginning of the ’9os, Theinerv

said. ,

But today, bands often don’t
even play in local houses as they
did in the past. Chesterﬁeld Road
and Neville Street both used to
have houses where local bands
would play regularly. A house self-

‘Game of Thrones’ deserves a
chance, even from sci-fi detractors

By Nate Kreichman
Staff Writer

All too often, fantasy literature is placed on
the same low pedestal as trite paperback
mysteries and teen paranormal romance.
This placement does not come without
reason. A lot of fantasy is, well, less than
stellar and not always appealing to adults.

’ Enter George R.R. Martin’si series “A
Song of Ice and Fire,” the cure for the com-

.mon paperback. In 2011, Time magazine

counted Ma Cm among the .world’s 100
most inﬂuen ial people, and in 2005 the

magazine dubbed the author ‘.‘the Ameri-

can Tolkien.”

Thus far, ﬁve of seven planned books
have been released. Its television adapta-
tion, HBO’s “Game of Thrones,” debuted
last year and we“ nominated forseveral

‘ awards, including Outstanding Drama Se-

ries and Best Television Series —— Drama at
the Emmys and the Golden Globes, respec-
tively. By the time season two premieres on
April 1, you should have caught up with the
show and read at least the ﬁrst two books
— but not in that order. V _

- If you unwrapped the series’ ﬁrst book,
“A Game of Thrones,” this Christmas and
quickly tossed it to your 11-year-old cousin,
you might want to go grab it back, lest his
innocence be subjected to all the violence,"
sex and death that should be yours by right.
A 2005 Chicago Tribune review said that
the series is “deﬁnitely not for children. It’s
a fantasy series for hip, smart people, even
those who don’t read fantasy.” ‘

The series takes place in a world remi-
_ niscent of medieval Europe and blends two

genres, fantasy and realism, that seem to
be polar opposites. “A Song of Ice and Fire”
does not tell the stories of heroic knights
and kings. Rather, it tells of human beings,
some of whom happen to be knights and
kings. This is not the ultimate struggle of
good versus evil; it’s people against people,

some of whom might be preferable to oth- -

ers, depending on your point of view.

Part of Martin’s strength as a storyteller
lies in his ability to make you relate to any
of his characters. He can humanize mon-
sters and make the most honorable men

‘seem like stubborn fools. There are con-

ﬂicts .in which it’s impossible to take one
side or the other because you like all of the
characters so damn much. Consequently,
the character you hated most in book one

might be who you’re rooting for most two

books later. .
A 2011 New York Times review said

' that one of the author’s greatest Virtues is

that he’s “unapologetically cold-blooded.”
Quite literally, anyone can be killed, which
opens a realm of possibility absent in the
majority of fantasy. What if Harry Potter

‘died in “The Sorcerer’s Stone,” and the

story moved on without him? Death itself

' isn’t even necessary; its mere potential is

part of what sets “A Song of Ice andAFire”
apart. No one is safe.

Don’t expect your favorite character
to come back to life after his head’s been
sliced off. Gandalf the White will not make
a triumphant return just when he’s needed
most. In the rare occasion when a character
is given a second chance at life, therreader
is left wondering whether that character
would’ve been better off dead. -

The way Martin approaches fantastical
elements further separates his work from
the majority of the genre.. _

The series’ ﬁrst’ scene introduces the
reader to a group of mythical enemies that
the majority of the characters believe to be
long extinct, if they existed at all. Follow-
ing the prologue, the ﬁrst book is notori-
ously bereft of the components of standard
fantasy. But as the story moves forward, the

layers that separate our world fromrthat

of the series are peeled away. We’re intro-
duced to dragons, sorcerers, skinchangers
and the like.

The unimaginable scope of the series’

world, along with the depth'of the charac-.

pters within it, make its focus at once pan-
oramic and microscopic. Therein lies one
of its greatest strengths — or weaknesses,
depending on who you ask. . .

My recommendation of the series
‘comes with a caveat: whether it’s in the

ﬁrst few episodes or the ﬁrst few chapters, »

you’re going to be confused, and maybe

even a little bored. The number of plot .

lines, characters. and locales can make

your ﬁrst experience more than a bit cha-

otic. “Who’s that?”,you’l1 wonder. “Wait,

what?” you’ll say.‘The. relations between

characters are so intricate that the media

package HBO sent to members of the press
before. the show’s debut included a family
' tree/ﬂowchart.

Pitt English professor Lori Campbell,’

who leads the Fantasy Studies Fellowship,
a student group dedicated to the study of
the fantastic, said she couldsnot, get past
this initial confusion and stopped reading
the series after a few chapters as aresult.
“There are just so many characters in

T those books — I didn’t ﬁnd myself caring

about them. [Ma.rtin'] didn’t_let me into the
-minds of those characters. I didn’t feel like

 

I was connected to them,” Campbell said.
To both‘ Campbell and the inevitably
confused ﬁrst-time reader or viewer, I say
this: persevere. The series. might not grab
you immediately, but once you’re hooked
into its world, you might ﬁnd you’d prefer
not to leave. -
Watching the show for a second time,
you’ll notice an abundance of detail that
had previously escaped you. There is, not a
single line of dialogue wasted. You simply
can’t recognize the enormous amount of

V foreshadowing until you go back andsee it

for yourself. .

.Reading (and ﬁnishing) the books be- i
A fore watching the show will solve any and

all problems of confusion and make.you
privy to even deeper complexities. For ex-
ample, Lord Beric Dondarrion makes just
one appearance in the show’s ﬁrst season.
Readers will smile knowingly as he utters
his single‘ line, “As you command,” well

aware that the Lightning Lord will be back, _
v again and again and again.

Plus, you get to watch as your friends,

sweet summer children that they are, look

on in amazement, horror and nearly ev-

-erythingin between at events you knew

were coming.‘ You hold all the secrets,'but
rather than spoiling your enjoyment of the
show, it enhances it. ' '

So get reading. m

collected from across the world. Each. ﬁlm

embodies’ an aspect of the theme “Faces of ;

Others.”

Since the festival’s commencement in
2006, it has had a uniﬁed premise.‘ Begin-
ning with “Faces of Democracy,” the fes-
tival has since explored a variety of other
topics before landing on this year’s broad-
er theme.

Because of— the multicultural compo-
nents of the International Film Festival,
this year’s theme allows the ﬁlms to focus
on individuals who represent different

 

ways of thinking. The camera acts as the
literal lens through which the audience
views a new perspective.

Nicole DiMascio, the managing coordi-
nator of the festival, explained the beneﬁts
of having a broader theme with more va-
riety. '

'. “In the past, the festival has had a lot
more narrow of a focus,” DiMascio'said.
“This one opened it up. We can include a
lot more stories from around the world.”

For this CMU junior, the “Other” is any-
thing that exists outside of an individual.
Everyone has the right to express them-
selves, despite the differences it brings to
light between individuals. _

Lion traveled to the Amsterdam Film

Festival in November 2011 to preview ﬁlms

PITT PROJEC OAKLAND+

and make selections to bring backyto Pitts-
burgh. She focused primarily on the ﬁlms’
artistic merit, as well as their levels of cor-.
respondence with the festival’s theme. .
The ﬁlms all have a high level of artistic
quality and are internationally‘ acclaimed
as award-winning, Lion explained. “Putin’s

Minister and current President—elect
Vladimir Putin, recently won‘ the 2012

award for Best Cinematography at the Sun- '

the 16 that has received acclaim.

. The Polish selections constitute an ex-
ample of a group of ﬁlms that demonstrate
a non—Western point of view. Because Po-
land is the “Other” to many countries, the
festival’s theme directly includes these
three Polish ﬁlms, she said. It gives audi-
ences a chancé..to see» the differences in a

- speciﬁc culture.

One of the. three ﬁlms will be the only
component of the festival that has its

, 22 theater. It will play on March 25. “Battle

of Warsaw 1920” by director Jerzy Hoff-
man is the ﬁrst :3-D ﬁlm created in Poland
and_required the technologically advanced
screen of a larger theater.

In addition to the ﬁlm screenings,
Lion made sure to include a variety of

activities for participants in the festi-

students will occur over thecourse of the
festival’s span of almost four weeks.

spite their differences in materials and or-
igins, still comply with the general theme
and will help viewers to experience differ-
ent cultures on the screen.

“The International Film Festival-does a
good job of bringing people together and
getting to see other cultures.‘ Pittsburgh

is a really diverse town, and it-’s bringing ,

more diversity to the city,” DiMascio said.
Because _the ﬁlms are from different

countries, their variation exposes audi-

ences to different ways of thinking across

' countries and cultures. The collection of
ﬁlms is one that expresses the separate '
perceptions of the world through assorted

societies, directors and people.

Lion’s central goal for'the festival is to '

humanize the global issues that each coun-
try faces and" illuminate them on an indi-

vidual basis through the subjective charac- .

ters each director portrays in the ﬁlms.
“The global issues are explored through
different angles,” she said. “What the ﬁlms
are trying to do —— and what is great about
these ﬁlms that we are bringing —- is that

' they are focusing on an individual, on a hu-

man.” @

of the Allies, was even home to a punk col-A
lective. A

The show at The Hideout is now an at-
tempt to allow bands once again to play in a
venue in the South Oakland neighborhood.

Gene Vercammen, a Pitt student and
acoustic guitarist for the band SleepyV, hopes
that the show at The Hideout will increase
the number of successful shows in South
Oakland. Though this ﬁrst show is his main
focus, it is also a way to spread word about
the South Oakland music scene.

For Vercammen, South Oakland Fest es-
sentially strives “to test the waters of the
2012 South Oakland neighborhood and make
known its potential for fostering an indie
music scene,” he said.

Blake Clawson, a guitar player and har-
mony vocalist from the band White Like Fire,
thinks Oakland has the potential to reinstate
aviable music scene but needs to gain more
support and organization. He hopes that
South Oakland Fest will open the eyes of bar
owners who could offer a venue and attract
the student population.

Vercammen agreed, and summed up the
declined music scene in three points.

“Lack of organization, presence of fac-
tion and [difficulty] getting the attention of
the students,” he said.

Both musicians’ bands play regularly with
the Garﬁeld Artworks at venues in Bloom-
ﬁeld, but the somewhat—distant commu-
nity does not always attract a large student
population. And with tens of thousands
of students, Pitt could deﬁnitely create a
crowd. I

“They are divorced by distance from the
30,000 college students,” Theiner said of
venues outside student hubs.

Students do not often cross this sort of
“geographic divide,” he said. Closer neigh-
borhoods like the South Side have become
more of a music hub in recent years as a
substitute for Oakland.

Clawson believes this weekend’s show
offers a good opportunity for students to see
the bands that usually play in other parts of
the city. The Hideout, which is within walk-
ing distance from much of Oakland, does
not require use of the bus and transporta-
tion system that venues in other Pittsburgh
neighborhoods do.

“It’s the core of entertainment: being able
to witness live music from the four bands
on the bill that don’t get to play in Oakland
a lot,” Clawson said.

For the second straight year, the fate

son rested in two Butler foul shots.

This year, the door stayed open.

ball in Butler’s possession,J.]. Moore

both attempts, and the game went to . .

GRAIN or SAUL

By Isaac Saul
Assistant Sports Editor y

The NFL’s suspension of the New
Orleans Saints head coach stole the
headlines; but in the shadows, Tim
Tebow lurked.

For the ﬁrst time since his late
teens, Tebow made a signiﬁcant
career decision — agreeing to be

traded to the New Yorkjets — and -

nobody is talking about it. The rea-
son?

Roger Goodell, the NFL com-
missioner, executed one of the
most controversial suspensions
in the history of the league. His
victim? Sean Payton.

Payton was not just part, but
the head of a staff that was reward-
ing players for injuring opposing
athletes, essentially handing out

p bounty rewards for certain players’

V

legs (“Hey, take Favre out of the
game by the second quarter, and
there will be a $10,000 check in
your locker”). Goodell’s response?
Dishing out a one-year suspension,
leaving the Saints without their
Super Bowl—winning head coach
for the entire 2012 season.

This is the coach who led a

previously 3-13 team back into
the playoffs for the ﬁrst time in
six years. This is the coach who did
it in the wake of Hurricane Katrina,
carrying an entire city on his back
and putting all its faith in the un-
proven arm of Drew Brees.

This is the guy who followed
that season by reaching the NFC
Championship game, only to be
knocked out by the Chicago Bears
—— a team his out—gained, and by all
accounts, outplayed, that day. For
his strides, he took the NFL Coach
of the Year award — with 44 out

of 50 votes. .

Two years later, the Saints’
Drew Brees was outdueling Peyton
Manning on the biggest stage in
the game: the Super Bowl. Payton
and Brees brought the Lombardi
Trophy back to New Orleans, and
the Saints have been in the Super
Bowl hunt every year since.

When news of the bounties
broke, he received harsh criticism
from columnists and shrugs from
players.

The reason? Everyone knows
this kind of thing happens in every
locker room. The Saints are like the
car that sped along with traffic and
got nailed with a speeding ticket.

Most players seemed surprised

it was an issue. Long-time offensive
lineman and current ESPN analyst
Damien Woody said, “The bounty
program happens all around the
league  not a surprise.”

Payton is the guy who used to
be known for locking himself in
team facilities, sleeping on couches
and studying plays on off-days. He
seems more like the kind of guy
who would be rewarding hard
work, not taking shortcuts by
injuringfthe best opponents and
certainly not by rewarding those
shortcuts.

And in all likelihood, the rea-
son he seems that way is because,
well, he actually is that way. Pay-
ton didn’t touch the defense. That

 

was Gregg Williams’ department.
And nobody touches Williams’
defense. , g

You see, Goodell’s one-year-
suspension decision isn’t just
throwing. the book at a guy. It’s
not dropping the mallet. '

It’s the hammer. It’s the sledge-
hammer. It’s dropping an anvil

from the top of the Empire State _,

Building after strapping C4 to it.
Literally destroying everything
around Sean Payton and wherever
he lands.

For the ﬁrst time since he ar-
rived, Saints’ quarterback Drew
Brees is in an odd ﬂux with con-
tract negations. Simply put, he’s
unhappy with the franchise tag

';_i .__5
I

shaugwsafterlloodell hands itoric suspension

instead of the big-money, long-
term deal. ‘

' Now the team is left without its
head coach, the coach that made
Brees good enough to get away
with being publicly unhappy about
his contract. '

Most people will argue that the
Saints will be ﬁne; they still have
all the same players, right? What’s
the big fuss? Fill in an interim head
coach, slide a guy here and a guy
there, give Drew Brees the ball and,
boom -— it’s all rigged up and ready
to go. -

But that doesn’t win games
over the course of a 16—game sea-
son. You can light a ﬁre under
your. guys, play for the coach and
do it this week, but you can’t say
that over and over for 16 weeks.
With Payton gone, there is a seri-
ous lapse in leadership. ‘Williams
would be next in line, but he’s
suspended too; the orders from

' the top would come from General

Manager Mickey Loomis —— but
he’s gone for 8 games.

Did I mention the draft? Oh,
yeah. That’s about a month away.
Well, Goodell took two of their sec-

’ ond—round picks to go along with

the three most important people
in a championship organization.
Not-that any of those three people
can be expected to draft the team
anyway, right? They’re suspended.
Williams indeﬁnitely.

So where does this leave the rest

. of the Saints? Well, right about in

the eye of the storm. A losing sea-
son in the NFL is not a good thing
to go through, especially when
your record-breaking quarterback
is in a contract year.

The big bucks they’ll have to

Western Conference playoff race is tight at the bottom

By Nate Barnes
Staff Writer

Similar to that of the NBA’s Eastern
Conference, the Western Conference
playoff race is all but decided at the
top. But what will keep fans interested
through the remainder of the season is
who will make the ﬁnal cut.

The Oklahoma City Thunder and San
Antonio Spurs have the No. 1 and 2 seeds,
respectively, all but wrapped up. With a

month left in the season, nine teams V

each have a claim to one of the remaining
six seeds. .
Asweallknow,theThunderdominated
the league this year. Their record of 34-
12 overall and 15-8 on the road both lead
the conference in those categories.
Kevin Durant, a candidate for Most
Valuable Player, leads the Thunder in
rebounds with 7.9 per game and ranks
second in the league in scoring at 27.5
points per game. Point guard Russell
Westbrook —— with his averages of 23.9

points per game and team-leading 5.4.

assists per game — pairs with Durant to
form arguably the best perimeter duo in
the league.

With perhaps the best defensive
frontcourt in the league in Kendrick

Perkins and Serge Ibaka —- who leads the

league in blocks at 3.3 per game — the
Thunder look like the favorites to finally
break through and make their first NBA
Finals appearance. *

' In second, the ageless San Antonio
Spurs lead the Southwest Division by
four games and are gearing up for yet
another deep playoff run under coach
Gregg Popovich. Point guard Tony "Parker
has taken the Spurs from power forward
Tim Duncan in the twilight of Duncan’s
career.

Averaging 20 points and 8 assists per
game, Parker is the engine that keeps
the team running, and he’ll ‘match up
worthily with the league’s best point
guards in the playoffs. _

Currently in third and leading the
Pacific Division by just a game and a
half over the fourth—place Los Angeles
Clippers, the Los Angeles Lakers need to
resolve some issues before the playoffs
this season.

Kobe Bryant leads the league in scoring
with 29.7 points per game, and Andrew
Bynum was named Western Conference
Player of the Week lastlweek to add to_ his
list of accomplishments compiled during
the first NBA season he has -not been

Pitt failed to ﬁnd its touch early. Senior Ash-

six misses. The Panthers’ startingﬁve combined
for seven points on 3—of-14 shooting. Gibbs went
scoreless and senior Nasir Robinson ﬁnished
with two points.
