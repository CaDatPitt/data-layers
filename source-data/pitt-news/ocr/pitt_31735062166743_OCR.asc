Posvar Sites Changed
Book Center Policies

(The following statement was prepared by Chancellor Wesley

Posoar and has been presented to Student Government.)

(See editorial, “The Need To Communicate,” page 4.)

In recognition of the recommendation made by the special
committee on Book Center Policy, I re-emphasize that a ten
percent discount to students-on hardback textbooks will be im-
plemented beginning with the winter term, 1967-68 on a trial
basis.

As recommended, the special Committee will be asked to
review the financial performance of the Book Center with re-
spect to the discount policy for students at the end of the aca-
demic year. The Book Center is being charged with the ob-
jective of operating at a break-even level, and continued dis-
counts for students will be adjusted accordingly.

In further accord with the recommendations of the Com-
mittee, a more thorough accounting system has been initiated
through the management of the Book Center.‘ The Center will
remain open to the entire University community and the general
public. However, the merchandise of the Book Center is to be
geared to the needs of the general University community, not
the general public. In accord with this objective, a re—evaluation
of the items specifically recommended by the Committee is
presently being undertaken by the Book Center management.
Some of the items to be eliminated from the Book Center, as
recommended by the Committee, must necessarily be phased
out of the market. However, the Book Center is being made
aware of the recommendation of the Committee that its stock
be primarily associated with the general needs of the Univers-
ity community. It is hoped that a better stock of books, academic
supplies, and art goods will be placed in the Book Center.

Effective with the winter term, 1967-68, students will re-
ceive a full refund of the purchase price of a new textbook
which is returned no later than one week following the last day
on which courses can be added to a student’s schedule. This is
the recommendation of the Committee, and will be implemented
with the winter term of this academic year. .

The needs and concerns of the student body as- expressed
through Student Government and resulting in the appointment
of the Special Committee on Book Center Policy show the value
of a constructive Student Government "organization. I am appre-
ciative of the continuing interest of Student Government in the
recommendations of the Book Center Committee.

ACUL Head Contends
Draft ‘Stifles’ Rights

Thomas Kerr, President of American Civil Liberties
Union of Pittsburgh, revealed several examples of the “st1f-
ling of civil liberties with respect to the draft.” V .

Kerr discussed the “unconstitutionality of draft regu-
lations” at the Wednesday night meeting of the Free Uni-
versity’s course on draft problems.

D The right to legal counsel is denied to the boy confronting his
draft board. Kerr pointed out that accused criminals have theright
to legal counsel, a right denied to 18- or 19-year old boys whose draft
board’s decision is final. Kerr mentioned that though the third cir-
cuit court (responsible for this area) is a fairly liberal one, it ruled
in 1965 that draft board proceedings are non-judicial and therefore

no counsel is needed.

Kerr also mentioned that un-
like criminal trials, the number
of witnesses appearing before the
draft board is limited. In addi-
tion, the boy is not permitted to
be present when his appeal is
reviewed, and he cannot carry
his case to a national board un-

See Israel As Threat

fessor of P-olitical Science at
the University spoke of “Is-
naePs
Arab Neighbors” at a spe-
cial program at the YM &
WHA Tuesday night. Cot-
tam‘ said that the “Abrabs
see Israel as a creation of
Western Imperialism.”

Arabs Fear Imperialism

by KAROLE UNITUS
Dr. Richard Cottam, pro-

Relations With Her

He stated that there was some

truth in this belief, citing Cot-
tofn that the French, British,
and US regimes have all inter-
fered to maintain the status quo.

Cottam holds little hope for
some of the proposed solutions
of the situation, changing the -at-
titude of the Arabs, playing on
the Arab’s fear o-f Israel, con-
vincing Arabs that the price of
destroying Israel is too high to
pay, and turning to the UN for
-forces which would protect both
countries.

Cottam feels the first solution
is not realistic because the Arabs
have suffered a blow to their
national dignity, and rather than
changing their attitudes, they

wish to gain back respect. The
7 he caileda “romantic no- .

tion’’ and pointed out that the
1954 movement to stop inﬁltra-
tion only caused more difficulty.

The third solution would fail
‘because of the “impossibility of
so few Jews convincing so many
Arabs,” and the fourth because
the big powers must be involved
in any solution and “those who
care most about Israel are put-
ting pressure on the US to do
nothing.”

Dr. Joseph Eaton, director of
the Advanced Program at the
Graduate School of Social Work,
stated that “theleociall situation

of the countries must be dealt
with.” He pointed out that a
policy of vassrilsation is character-
istic of the US’s policy in the
Middle East, citing the example
of the Suez Affanir wlhecre the
US supported the Arabs, as op-
posed to the current crisis.

Eaton reinarked that his out-
look on the situation is more
optimistic than Cottam’s. He
stated that “now is the ﬁrst
time the Arabs in Palestine have
had their say . . . already Arab
and Jewish children are being
educated together.”

Eaton believes that the Arab-s
and the Jews, like the countries
of Russia and Japan or East
and West Germany, will be able
to live together in peace with-
out completely settling their dif-
ferences.

Dr. Richard Rubensterin, the
third speaker at the prognrva-m,
praised the Jews in the Middle
East for not placing blind faith
in their allies, undersst-anding

‘their predicament, and “using

their own ‘brains to stay alive.”
He said, “The situaartion will not
be like the one in Germany.
When Israel goes, many Aurabs
will go with her.”

  

  
  
 

less there is dissent at the local
level.

*> Cruel and unusual punish-
ment is dealt out to draft card
burners. Through an act pushed
by Mendell Rivers of South C aro-
lina who wished to “stop this
disrespect,” Kerr said that burn-
ing a draft card is considered
“effective speech” and is punish-
able by five years’ imprisonment
and up to $10,000 fine. Irohical-
ly, Kerr said, the ripping, burn-
ing, and stomping on an Ameri-
can flag subjects one to a maxi-
mum of 60 days’ imprisonment.

>The right to remain silent
and to have access to legal coun-
sel, is being ignored. Kerr cited
the case of the October 21 week-
end visits of» FBI agents who
swarmed Yale draft card return-
ers and other dissenters in their
homes between Sunday at mid-
night and through Tuesday.

>The clause in the conscien-
tious objector paragraph regard-
ing belief in a Supreme Being or
a sincere, meaningful parallel to
the orthodox belief in God has
been removed. According to Kerr,
Mendell Rivers and Mark Clark
of South Carolina were primar-
ily responsible for the new draft
law and removed the clause be-
cause it was “causing a lot of
fuss.” Thus, he said, it might be
interpreted that the man with
no real training and belief in a
pacifist religion has a weaker po-
sition in comparison with the re-
ligious man in terms of receiving
the c.o. deferment.

> It is illegal to counsel con-
scientious objectors if the coun-
selor incites them to commit the
act of willful obstruction of armed
forces duties. Kerr stated that

   SG Passes Bills 4

ConcerningAllocations,
Overseas Travel Fund

by PAUL STOLLER

The Stuident Government (S-G) Senate passed two reso-
lutions at its Wednesday night meeting-

One of the bills, sponsored by Senator Bill Ralph, con-
cerned the procedures for allocating funds, the recording of
expenditures, the requisitioning of funds, and the approval

0 of allocations.

“There is no check, outside of -an organu'zation’=s adviser,” in-

‘ sisted Ralph, “on the expenditures of that organization.” Ralph

stated that the organization -adviser, in many cases, rarely or nev-
er has any indication of the organfi2Jation’s expenditures.

Ralph also indicated that the present requisition procedure is
cumbersome enough to warrant such devious practices as writing

up transportation vouchers “for

‘petty cash.”

In response to the alleged
need for ﬁscal revisri-on, Ralph's
bill resolved the following points:

> All clubs and organizations

A receiving allocations through

proper procedure with the Allo-
cations «Cormmrittee shall be re-
quired to compile an accurate
and truthful account of all ex-
penditures and incomes along
with accompanying receipts and
deposit slips -should be made
available to the Aillocaxtions Com-
mittee and SG.

- > A Purchasing Study Com-
mittee should be formed to study
the requisition procedures for
student organizations. It could
be appointed by the president.

>'Ph-e ISG should have the
means to accept or reject parts
of allocation requests which are
subjected to SG approvlazl as

ca

 

well as being able to accept or
reject the entire allocation.

The second bill passed by the
Senate related to overseas trav-
el. SG President Ken Frederick
explained that‘ there is a lack
of University scholarsh-ips for
summer travel abroad. He also
pointed out the “S” (Scholar-
ship award for overseas study)
has been discontinued.

The bill provides for an over-

seas award of at least $500 to O

help defray the cost of a stu-

dent's summer experiences out-,

side the continental United
States»

The new $500 gnanrt -can be
given to any freshman, sopho-
more, or junior student in «good
standing at the University. The
bill also stipulates that the
awardee report to the student
body through the Gen-erall As-
sembly aafter  return.

‘Pitt News’ Review

S. Fransisco Mime Troupe

Satirizes the Vietnam War

The San Francisco Mime
Troupe presented its “rad-
ical guerilla theater” version
of Goldoni’s The Military
Lover at Carnegie — Mellon
University Monday and
Tuesday nights. The play, run-
ning well over two and one half
hours with only a ten minute
intermission, was a satire on
our present involvement in Viet-
nam. The pot was very thin
and served only as a devise to
mock out, at numerous occa-
sions, the Johnson Administra-
tion, General Hershy, and, of
course, the war effort.

The action takes place in his-
toric Italy, after a Spanish in-
vasion and subsequent occupa-
tion. An Italian Merchant’s
daughter falls in love with a
Spanish lieutenant. The mer-
chant, Pantalon, absolutely for-
bids his daughter to marry the
soldier and declares -in anger
that he would sell her ﬁrst.

Mean-w‘-hile, two Spanish re-

cruiting officers enlist the lover
of the daughter’s maid servant
into the army, much to the dis-
may of -the maid servant. Asked
by the maid servant why he en-
listed, the lover said he joined
for the respect and the beautiful
uniform soldiers receive at only
a small charge.

Pantalon’s daughter and her
mglidmslelrvagivt they discuss the
war and how it will ‘éitfabr tli‘e
futures of their respective lov-
ers, and decide that neither man
will return. The daughter then
turns to her father and declares

that the war is morally wrong
and violates everything. But
Pantalon has more on his mind
than to listen to his daughter’s
cries. He plans to have his
daughter make -love to the Span-
ish General Garcia in order to
insure his ﬁnancial position in
occupied Italy.

At their first meeting, the
General exp-ounds on the ideals
of free speech, which he declares
is the foundation of his nation.
The daughter then repeats to
the General her feelings that
the war is morally wrong. In
anger, Garcia says, “You have
no right to oppose the war.”
How do you think it makes the
boys feel? It upsets him to see
that ‘the people are not 100 per
cent behind the war effort and
their leaders.

Later, the maid servant’s lov-
or is charged with desertion af-
ter he tries to escape from the
army by disguising himself as
a woman. He is about to be shot
when his girl friend, dressed as
the Pope, sto-ps the execution
and declares that the war is
over. She, as the Pope, states
that the war only results in the
destruction of other people. She

orders Pantalo-n to permit. his
daughter to marry the Spanish
lieutenant, and the play is over.

The play, basically informal
and sometimes obviously adlib-
bed, included some very salty
comments against the present
war effort and war in general.
Comments such as “Become an
officer and make it with the
President's daughter,” and anti-
war songs such as “Join the
Army" dedicated to Barry Sadd-

lerwpwere numerous. I think,
3 ‘Y rn iv‘-A .
'l1?)we‘v‘e'f', by relating ‘the events

of today to the absurd events
in the plot, the play made its
point.

The San Francisco Mime
Troupe is a group of very ac-
complished actors. I was especi-
ally impressed by the actors
who played Pantalon and the
maid servant. The material was
funny but extremely naughty at
times. Some of the more deli-
cate females in the audience ap-
peared somewhat embarrassed
at first by the actons’ baudy ges-
tures and vulgar language. But
these ladies’ inhibitions gave
away after the first few min-
utes of the play, for they soon
laughed along with the rest of
the ‘audience.

One thing is certain, The Mil-
itary Lover very successfully
mocked the war effort through
their use of humor. And, in our
times, humor can be a powerful
‘tool and is something we need
a great deal more of. For in-
stance, at one point in the play,
a puppet, telling of the many
ways to escape the draft, yelled
out to the audience, “Hell no,
we won't go,” as members of
the audience repeated the chant
in unison for the following few

are not informed of facts that are later used to alter decisions in which

At the beginning of this term, Chancellor Posvar announced that
students would receive a ten per cent discount on hard-covered textbooks
beginning Januaryjllhe Chancellor’s decision was a re-sult of the recom-
mendations made by the Committee to Review Book Center Policy, which
‘ met during the spring term to resolve -the questions raised by students
last year concerning the book center policy now in practice.

The Committee to Review Book C-enter Policy was composed of three
A administrators, three faculty members, and three students, who recom-
mended ‘to the then Chancellor Kurtzman that a ten per cent discount be
initiated for the current term of all textbooks. When the Committee made
its recommendation,"the student participants were led to believe that there
was a real possibility that the Committee’s recommendations would not
only be enacted in full,'but that the discount would be in effect for this

We later were told that this was obviously impossible, as the fiscal
year ‘had already begun and there was no provision in the budget to pro-
vide for the discount. The Chancellor felt that the most that could be done
was to initiate a ten percent discount on hard-covered textbooks only, be-
ginning in the Winter Term.

that many‘ of the nation's

they have participated. Students‘ obviously cannot be in possession of all

the facts, but they should not be led to believe that something is feasible
when in reality it is not. We really believed that the discount could be
enacted this term. Why would we think otherwise, as no one alerted us to
the real state of affairs? _

Student participation on the Committee to Review Book Center Pol-
icy was at first viewed as a real landmark in allowing students to partici-
pate on the decision-making level. It is lamentable that we were not in-

formed of a state of affairs that can only be termed common knowledge.

Besides tuition, universi-
ties look to their endow-
ments. Endowments, how-
ever, are not as impressive
as they seem to be. George
Pake, vice chancellor of
Washington University, ex-
plains that his university

has « an endowment totaling '

$120 million. But, according
to Pake, this only covers a
tenth of Washington’s op-
erating expenses.

Universities can also look
to grants and gifts to cover
their expenses. Given the
failure of these outlets for
income, American colleges
are still in trouble.

MANY PRIVATE univer-
sities have had_ to become
affiliated with state systems
of education in order to re-

main functioningbodies. This '

University, of course, is no
exception to this phenomena.
State relatedness, however,
adds a new dimension to the
local problem. That problem.
is politics.

It is all to apparent that
state politics forced the Uni-
versity to borrow about $5
million to cover operating
expenses. Budgetary hassels
will indeed cause phenomena
such asthis in the future.

This broad crudial problem
which directly affects the na-
tional interest is not insolu-
able. The Washington Star
believes that the answer lies
in private donation. “If they
(the public) want American
colleges to continue offering
those opportunities that are
the envy of the class-ridden
old world . . . they must in-
vest in their future.”

IF THE. university is to
solve its fiscal problems, it
will have to solicite its Alum-
ni. An effective alumni fund-
raising campaign that is care-
fully organized would mark

I ‘refused to attend a subse-
quent meeting with you to dis-
cuss appeal proceedings. My
reasons are these: 1) I acted
as I did knowing and expecting
your “punishment” to be dis-
proportionate to the “crime.” 2)
I do not appeal now because, in
the fullest extent of your power,
you cannot punish_me at all.
That is to say, the things you
can take from me I can do with-
out. Were you able to divorce
me from values, I would appeal.
3) If I were interested in seek-
ing a fair hearing, I would first
ask why I could not be shown
in writing what regulation I
had violated. Second, I would de-
mand a trial by jury of my
peers and defense by a person
who was well familiar with Uni-
versity regulations. As it is, I
refuse to participate in that
sham justice you call an Appeal
Board. 4) I refuse also simply
to talk to a man who can soil
the name academics by associat-
ing it with ROTC, and am furth-
er horrified by the thought that
men like this have control of
so many of our “academic” in-
stitutions.

Editor, The Pitt News:
Recently, there hav been num-

We were fighting for the establishment of a policy which could never have
been enacted under the terms ‘we set up, but we never were to know this
until weeks after the Committee terminated its Work.

We still see no reason the Committee’s work and report could not
have been scheduled in time to be included in this fiscal year. And we can-
not really view the results of our efforts as a victory.

We only hope that students will be better informed the next time
they have the opportunity t-o participate in a policy committee. For unless
they are in possession of the facts that govern the specific situation, they
cannot really contnibute to the issue at hand; their participation becomes
only a token bestowed upon by the administration and not the real voice
we are striving to attain.

juke-box is causing in the Tuck
Shop; that it is literally impos-
sible to be heard without yell-
ing, and the noise alone made
it impossible to study.

First of all I’d like to say that
this is my third trimester at
the University, and as a com-
muter, I am in the Tuck Shop
every single day at one time
or another. From the first day
of my freshman year, I have
always been under the impres-
sion that the Tuck Shop was a
place to eat and where one so-
cially. gathered with his friends.
I was never led to believe tlralt
conversation -or any other form-
of entertainment was to be kept
at a minimum in order to ac-
commodate those that wished to
study. Even if this were so, in
a dining area in a. university
the size of ours, this would be
~im-possib-le to enforce. There are
many other places where a stu-
dent may converse “intelligent-
ly” or study. I thought that the
library was one such place that
one could study -in a quiet at-
mosphere. Such was the case
on the morning of Thursday,
October 19, when I had gone
to the library on the fifth floor
of the Cathedral prepared to do
some intensive study for my his-
tory rnid-term.

I sat at a table where only
one other girl was sitting. Two
boys sat down and began dis-
cussing a certain controversial
issue. The discussion evolved in-
to a heated debate. The other
girl had left the library, and I
had moved to a chair in the
immediate vicinity, thinking that

maybe it was only their prox-‘

imity that was annoying me.
Their voices rose above the us-
ual clatter of thellibrary, i.e.
typing, telephone ringing, etc,

I approached one of the girls
at the desk about this, and she
told me to tell them to keep it
d0Wn. and in so many words,
there was nothing that she could
do about it.

I feel that my complaint is
just as worthy,» if not more so,

of the editorial space granted to .

For A Change

' Eidtor, The Pitt News:

When a football team con-
sistently loses games, it seems
that -every concerned alumnus
and every “so-called” coach
comes out of the woodwork to
offer suggestions for improving
the situation. Then there are
others- like myself-who fit into
neither of the above categories,
and who feel that they have
something to" say.

Having heard so much about
losing football teams at Pitt, I

decided to do just a little re-

search on the subject. In check-
ing th-e records of games play-
ed in past years (see Pitt Foot-
ball Guide 1967) one can readily
see that Pitt has been playing
far less than .500 ball since
1939. During the past 28 years
the team has lost 148 games
while winning 115. Over that
span of years only two coaches
managed to win more games
than have lost. Those two were
L. P. Dawson, who won 9, lost
8, and tied one, and Jo-hn P.
Michelosen, who won 56, lost 49,
and ti-ed 7. I believe that Mr.
Michelosen was fired.

Since 1939 ten coaches have
headed the panthers and for
the most part all ten have had
less than glowing records at
Pitt. i

so much-for the past. Many
questions could be raised about

‘ the variables which have con-

tributed to losing efforts over
the past 28 years, but little
could be gained by playing that

game. We must concern our-
selves with the future, and it
appears to me that the future
of football at Pitt lies in the
hands of the administration of
the university.

As I .see it, a university, or
multi-versity should in fact be
just that. It could offer, some-
thing for all who are within
its boundaries. It should not ex-
pect all to conform to the _same
rigid standards, but should be
flexible permitting all an op-
portunity to function maximally
within the limits of their capa-
bilities. There should be a place
in a multi-versity for “Satur-
day’s hero” as well as the phi-
beta-kappa. One of. the divisions
of a multi-versity is the foot-
ball team and all that goes with
it on a Saturday afternoon.

Let's be honest about it. The
football stadium seats well over
50,000 people, but at the present
state of affairs, it will never
be filled (except when all the
locals show up for the Notre
Dame game) when the team is
losing season after season after
season. To remedy the situation
football players should be re-
cruited because they are capa-
ble of playing good football, not
because they are capable of
earning advanced degrees. Part
of the appeal ofethe mu1t-i-vers-
ity is the Saturday afternoon
“carnival” and the university
should admit it and make it a
really big show. We can not
brag about having the toughest
schedule in the country and then
lose all the games on the sched-
ule. Each Saturday then becomes
exactly what Nipsy Russell said,

A case of the Christians against
the lions.

I don’t feel that the Univers-
ity would be lowering standards
by accepting a potential super
star who could bring the fans
to the arena. Surely the univers-
could be flexible enough to pro-
vide a curriculum for boys of
this caliber, and if necessary,
the student body could provide
tutors and guidance for those
needing help. We realize that
the largest percentage of our
football players are indeed top
students etc. and are quite capa-
ble of making it in the current
set up. But we also know that
week after week they play
against other Pennsylvania boys
who have not been able to get
into Pitt. Furthermore it seems
that the atheletic department
should.- be able to recruit more
players than they are Pttrmitted
to recruit at the present time.
It seems that the team con-
stantly lacksdepth.

If the university would re- ‘

think its position on the foot-
ball program and accept the
two above recommendations, it
would permit the football team
to make their contribution to
the program and relieve the
coaching staff of much frustra-
tion. It’s senseless to talk about
what Miami, Notre Dame etc.
do in their football programs
and rationalize our defeats to
those teams by saying, “Aca-
demically we're better.” You
can’t fill Pitt stadium on ration-
alzations. Let’s face it; 50,000
people in the stadium means
over a quarter of a million dol-
lars in the pot!

-— ’ -.,

o The Editor

If Pitt continues its search
for the academically talented
for the football team, then it
might as well plant some more
ivy against the walls and try
to get in the League. Failing in
that we can try to schedule
teams like Temple, Bucknell, and
the University of Louisville.
Furthermore the question of
playing in the proposed new sta-
dium could receive an affirma-
tive answer, because ' so few
people go to the old one any-
more that it could just as well
be dismantled. However, the
city of Pittsburgh would not
stand to gain much by having
Pitt play at the new stadium,
because most people would not
bother to spend the bus fare
to get there. Those who live
nearby aren’t even bothering to
walk up the hill any more.

If something isn’t done soon
the chancellor's buses which
take his guest to the games are
going to be so empty that I
might even get an invitation to
sit in his box . . . I can see my-
self above the maddening non-
crowd, watching the sacrifice
and wondering about the glories
of the old Sutherland days, some
28 years ago. But more realis-
tically I must face the fact that
many of the super stars are be-
ing educated at places like
Miami, UCLA, Penn State, etc,
and on Saturdays I can watch
them beat Pitt. It would seem
that after 28 years a multi-vers-
ity of our caliber would have at
least learned that we can’t beat
’em so We ought to join ’em.

Victim of Theft
‘Thanks’ Finder

Editor, The Pitt News:

I want to thank the person
who found the purse that I
left in Cafeteria on Wednesday
morning. I was very happy to
get my purse back since it con-
tained my I.D. card, meal ticket,
check book, driver’s license, and
key to my room. This consid-
erate person “charged” me only
$10 for the effort it took him to

walk the few steps to the cafe- ~

teria office. So once again I

want to thank him. And I hope

he makes very good use of the
$10 he took from my wallet.

that some of America’s great
students are responsible, for
producing this great student
newspaper.

The Pitt News is a student
newspaper by virtue of the
fact that the great students
publishing it are true stu-
dents. This, our great Univer-
-sity, was conceived in the be-
lief that American youth has
a lot to learn, and those
youths publishing The Pitt
News have as much to learn
about anything «as «anyone.

And, lastly, The Pitt News
is a newspaper. In the great
tradition of the American
press, our student newspaper
presents news, features and
sports with an unjaundiced

The Heinz Chapel Choir, un-

der the direction of Paul D.

Buxtehude Concert Sunday at
3 p.m. This is the ﬁrst in the
series of Sunday concerts pre-
sented monthly in Heinz Chap-
el. Robert S. Lord, the uni-
versity organist, and a String‘
ensemble will accompany the
choir.

The choir will present eon-
certs in the chapel on Thanks-
giving and Christmas. They
have also planned a tour for
the week between the Winter
and Spring Trimester, similar
to last year’s performance in
Erie, Pa., New York, and Wash-
ington, D.C.

The choir does not sing in
the Sunday Protestant serv-
ices in the Chapel as it did
before the University became
state-related. Instead, the Unit-
ed Oakland Ministery provides
a Sunday Choir.

Pitt News Remew

by ELI GOLDMAN

Professional radio has re-
stricted itself in the Pitts-
burgh area to a few pop
music stations such as
KDKA and KQV. This
year, a student radio sta-
rtion has begun to take a place
‘in the quality broadcasting of
«rock ’n -roll.

On the air. 24 hours a day,
WPGH program-ming has kept
pace with the new groups,
styles and recordings that have

i changed the pop music scene.

The emphasis this year has
shifted to the newly released
singles and albumns and an 
provement in the overall quality
of student broadcasting.

A ﬁrs-t  year has been the

_initiation of the WPGH “Long
Sho " each week, a record pick-
ed by the staff as «a potential
Top 10 recording. The results
have been good, and Well over
50 per cent of the picks have
become best-selling singles. The
top 25 survey has also been im-
proved by polling the bestsell-
mg singles in many of the rec-
ord stores in the area and in

other cities.

In past years, the survey was
more or less a consensus of
opinion among the WPGH staff
or a carbon copy of the surveys
of the professional stations. The
new surveys are, for the first
time, believable and greatly im-
prove the quality of broadcast-
ing.

The emphasis o-n new releases
has resulted, however, in an un-
fortunate situation; the number
of “oldies” played during prime
time has been severely restrict-
ed because of the new program-
ming policy. One of the better
aspects of WPGH was the play-
ing of oldies frequently through-
out the day.

The better qualities of past
years have been continued in
the present format. The request
and dedication service has been

enlarged, so students this year

no longer ﬁnd the line=s con-
tinually busy. They can «even get
their requests on the «air the
same night they call. So if your
girl friend wants to hear Brian
H~ighland’s superlative rendition
of “Yellow Pokadot Bikini,” your
chances are vastly improved.

 

The disc jockey staff has also
improved this year. The back-
ground voices of friends in the
studio no longer drowns out the
announcer as he introduces the
next song. They are sounding
more professional than ever be-
fore.

With the increased Student
Government (SG) allocations,
WPGH has been able to buy
new equipment this year. It
now rates as -one of -the best-
equipped student radio stations
in the country. The hum you
might be hearing is merely a
ﬁgment o-f your imagination.

The cultural programs being
presented by WPGH have gen-
erally been well regarded by the
students. “The Bridge” has been
an attempt toward a greater de-
gree of communication between

the Chancellor and the student
body. Questions addressed -to the
Chancellor are phoned in to
WPGH and answered during
Dr. Posvar’s weekly broadcast.

The coverage of SG events
has also improved and an SG
report is broadcasted frequently.
In recent years, the coverage of
SG elections can be lauded. De-
bates betwen the major candi-
dates were very successful and

met with .a great deal of student _

interest.

Last April, WPGH discontin-
ued the campus soap opera “AS
the Campus Turns” and the ad-
ventures of Virginia Nicely and
Jack Spector that kept us glued
with suspense to WPGH each
week were ended. It was a re-
freshing idea and should have
been continued.

  Sky Diving Generates A

Enthusiasm In Student

By IVAN ABRAMS

Jumping out of airplanes may not be attractive to most
University students, but to Bob Feldman, liberal arts jun-

ior, “it’s fantastic.”

Feldman has been sky diving, or sport parachuting,
since September 23 of this year.

“I’d always wanted to do it, but it was only when I met some-
one who skydives at Kiski Sport Parachute Club that the oppor-
tunity presented itself," says Feldman. “I went out to Kiski,” he
continues, “on a Saturday, started training, and jumped for the first

time at 7 p.m. that same evening.”

Training for skydiving consists of learning the parts of a para-

chute, how to steer a parachute, emergency procedures, how to land.
and what to do if the main parachute doesn’t open.

“The first jump was more me-
chanical than any thing else, “in-
sists Feldman. “I really co-uldn’t
think about all I had to do and
notice what the actual feeling
was at the same time,” he says.

However, Feldman describes

the later jumps as being “more
of everything.” “I was more a-

ware of what was happening, I

knew what to look for, and I
could feel more,” he exclaims.

So far, Feldman has made sev-
en jumps. On his fourth he land-
ed poorly and sprained his an-
kle. Other than this he has had
no trouble or emergencies.

HAPPY HOMECOMING

Compliments of

Frederic Hand, a 20-year-
old classical guitarist, per-
formed last Tuesday night
at the Carnegie Lecture Hall.
He played to a small, intimate
audience which seemed quite ap-
preciative and well aware of the
classical quitar repertory.

Hand was able to handle eas-
ily the technical complexities of
the guitar, and showed an amaz-
ing maturity of interpretation
in such varied pieces as John
Dowland’s “Three Elizabethan
Dances,” and Villa-Lobos’ “Etude
No. 11.” The “Partita No. 15” by
S. L. Weiss gave Hand a little

Hand Performs At Carnegie

trouble. He performed the dis-
so-nant chordal passages of the
Prelude and Toccata beautifully,
but the Fugue, a fiendish piece
of music, had the guitarist’s
left hand travelling up and down
the neck of the guitar at a con-
siderable speed, and occasional
“jam-up” were evident.

One of the high-points. of the
program was the “Gavotte,” ori-
ginally for cello, by J. S. Bach.
The biting precision and clarity
with which Segovia usually per-
forms Bach was not imitated by
Hand, but his mellower (and
equally sound) performance was
completely satisfying.

Hand's finest playing was evi-
denced in the Fernando Sor
“Variations on a Theme” from
Mozart’s The Magic Flute. The
delicate and emotional t hir d
variation was perfect. T he
fourth and fifth variations, both
difficult repeated trip-let pat»
terns, were likewise beautiful.
And the dazzling grand ﬁnal was
orilliantly performed with vir-
tuosity.

Hands performance of the
Vrillla-Lobos Work was filled with
the dark and fiery primitive-
ness that the music called for.
His dynamical control was just
effective enough, and he han-
dled Well the tricky rlhythms,
altemating 5/4 and 2/2, despite
a. few technical problems.

The romantic “Blarcarole and
Scherzino” by Alexandre Tans-
man was delightful for the aud-

ience and and obviously for
Hand also. The Barcacrole was
pretty and melodic, a nd the
‘Sche-rziino «lively and exciting.

No program of guitar music
would be complete without a
representative Spanish number,
and Hand fulfilled this expec-
tation with two works by the
contemporary composer, Fed-

erico Torroba. 'Dorroba’s com-' A

positions are filled with Iberan
nhythms, ﬂamenco inﬂuences,
and exciting bravura effects.
He wrot many pieces for An-
dres Segovia, who performs
them frequently, and Hand’s
'performance did not suffer by
companison. _

The minor diffiiculrbies Hand
expenienced with the Weiss and
Villa-Lovbos pieces do not de-
tract from the overall compet-
ance and maturity of his per-
formance. Little more needs to
be said than -that 
Hand, at 20 years of age, is 
complete control of the clawi-
cal guitar repemtory, and is one
of its finest exponents.

SDS Critic Speaks

Friday, November 3, 1967

 

—— THE PITT NEWS _ Page 11

Pool Wants Funds Stopped

WASHINGTON (CPS) ——One
United S t a t e s Congressman
thinks the Federal Government
should deny funds to any col-
lege or university which per-
mits Students for a Democratic
Society to have an organized
chapter on its campus.

“SDS has been infiltrated by
the Communists, and therefore
I think all colleges throughout
the United States should ban
SDS from their campueses,”
Rep. Joe Pool (D.-Tex.).

Pool, a member of the House
Committee on Un-American Act-
ivities (HUAC), said he is cur-
rently investigating SDS, but
he has not decided if he will in-
troduce legislation in Congress
concerning the student organiza-
tion.

However, he strongly believes

Congress should stop giving
Federal money to colleges which
have SDS chapters. ~ .“Why
should Congress furnish money
to any organization -,1 institu-

and unpatriotic acts against the

said college administrations, by
merely permitting SDS on their
campuses, are showing their ap-
proval and in a small way pro-
moting the goals of the organ-
ization.

Pool said he is opposed to
SDS because its members are
“trying to destroy our national-

war effort.

“They may not be breaking the
law themselves because of the
First Amendment, but they are
getting other people to break
the law.” ,

Pool said any college which
has such activity on its cam-
pus shou} not receive “the tax-
payers’ money. We should not
use tax funds to pay for draft
resistance.”

“I’m sure the majority of the
members of Congress will be

group and their attempts to ;

ed.

“I believe in freedom of
speech and freedom of the press
and all the other principles in
the First Amendment,” Pool
said. “But you have to draw
the line when an organized
group actually tries to destroy

the very strength of our armed  

might, the draft.”
The Congressman said if SDS
members “are teaching people
to violate the law and to engage
in illegal acts, it is not a viola.-
tion of the First Amendment
to stop them. They have exceed-
ed their rights to freedom of
speech and the press. These
peole ar gettingclose to advocat-
ing the oventhrow of the gov-
ernment when they do this.”

  
   

Although Pool is conducting if

his own investigation of SDS,
he said he also has asked HUAC
to investigate “SDS and other
organization-s which are trying
to stop the draft.” He said he
wants HUAC to haye “ formal
and widespread investigation to‘
see if our internal security laws
need tightening.”

WASHINGTON (CPS) — Most students, many fac-

heard of the American Council on Education (ACE).

Yet the ACE is the most powerful and influential

'n_igher education organization in the United States. It is
a super-association, counting among its membership 189

national and regional education
associations and 1,261 colleges
and universities.

Yet the ACE is the most pow-

Most of its power -is wielded
by a staff of 100 people, working

problemsof importance to the
nation’s college administrators.

VVhen ACE holds its national
conference, as it did for the 50th
time last weekend, it is indeed a
meeting of the American Educa-
tional Establishment. Tall, gray-
haired presidents of big univer-
sities, pipe-puffing deans, shuf-
ﬂing presidents of small .collegs,
and even a good complement of
nuns and priests moved about

«Q, the spacious halls and" numer-



  

are meeting reams at wasiiiiig-
ton’s plush Shoreham Hotel, lis-
tening to panels discuss every-
thing from the university as cri-
tic of society, to the university
as servant of society.

Yet what was said~either on
the panels or in the corriders
was perhaps less important than
who was saying it and the way
the administrators listened.

It was obvious that the de-
mands for student power and
student rights have gotten
through to the men who run the

“ -nation’s colleges. They are aware

of students as more than num-
bers in an enrollment -list, an-
other source of funds, and one
group involved in the almost
secondary university function of
teaching and learning.

At last year’s ACE meeting
there was one student on an en-
tire program that dealt with
teacher evaluation and improve-
ment. Two years ago, when stu-
dents themselves were the topic
of the ACE conference, four out
nine panels lacked a student rep-
resentative.

But this year there were stu-
dents or “student-types” on
every panel. And the adminis-
trators clearly enjoyed the Whole
thing.

how they tried to shift the focus

He also cut apart the n0t-i011
with which they comfort them-
selves in the face of student up-

caused mostly by “Student
sti-ees" and can be solved by
more personal attention.

‘listen to them and talk about

teaching and learning as impor-
tant functions, one had the feel-
ing that the people at the ACE
meeting would have preferred
to get back to things closer to
their hearts, like the slowing of
the federal ﬂow of research
funds described by ACE staffer
John Morse Wednesday nigh.t
or the question of how to get
more money out of the public,
the government, and the alumni,
which Ford Foundation Presi-
dent McGeorge Bundy discussed
in his clos.ing speech Friday
morning. ’ i

That was never stated, but it

came out subtly in several ways:
> Though a panel on teaching
and learning Thursday drew the
largest turnout of -any" of the
three that morning, 90 per cent
of the people present were from
colleges of less than 4,000 stu-
dents, according to a show of
hands taken by Werdell.
> The most signiﬁcant contri-
bution to the central theme of
the conference, goals for higher
education, was probably made
by Yale Professor Kenneth Ken-
niston. He argued that criticism
of the society ought to join
teaching, research, «and service
as one of the major functions
of a university. He said that this
meant -that the university should
make sure that its students and
faculty members were free to
exercise their critical roles.
> Yet few people were at the
panel that discussed his paper
(it had competed with a session
on who ought to run colleges,
in which students were relegated
to a footnote in the background
paper) and the next morning
the wrap-up panel on priorities
was back to talking about the
old triumverate. That bore out
one of Kenniston’s main points:
teaching, research, -and service
are pretty easy to explain to
trustees, legislators, and the
public, but students demonstrat-
ing against the war are not.
Thus administrators prefer to
kep that sort of thing in the
background.
> Though he acknowledge “that
student roles will change,” ACE
President Logan Wilson in his
report to the conference express-
ed concern over “widespread at-
tempts to deride authority in
-all ﬁelds” and the idea that prob-
lems of higher education can be
solved “by assuming that every-
body concerned has equal com-
petence to grapple with them by
trying to conduct these institu-
tions like perpetual debating so-
cieties.”

He emphasized leadership by
administrators and hardly men-
tioncd students at all in a ﬁve
point list of “critical problems"
facing higher education. Nor did
he mention the critical role of
the university or making educa-
tion relevant to societal prob-
lems, two major problems artic-
ulated .by students at the con-
ference. '

by WALTER GRANT

WASHINGTON (CPS) —
The nation’s leading educa-
tors are beginning to accept
the idea that students should
be actively involved in the
the decisions which affect
their education. ‘

But they are undecided about
just how far this involvement
should be extended and worried
about its effects on such prac-
tical matters as relations with
trustees legislators, the public,
and the very education which
their institutions provide.

Student involvement in aca-
demic decision-making was a
frequent topic as some 1,700 ad-
ministrators of colleges and uni-
versities across the country
gathered here two weeks, ago
for the 50th annual meeting of
the American Council on Edu-
cation.

And although most of the col-
lege presidents and other execu-
tives who participated i-n the
program endorsed significant
sit-‘.ident participation in the gov-
erning of academic institutions,
there nevertheless seemed to be
an undercurrent fear of the stu-
dent activist movement and of
the cries for student power.

This fear and concern about
the future was evident from the
very start of the conference
when Dr. 'Samuel B. Gould,
chancellor at the State Univers-
ity of New York, warned in his
keynote address that the “power
of student activism cannot be
minimized nor can its potential
for creating and maintaining un-
rest be taken lightly.”

He added, “Unrest and tension
on a campu.s can and should
be dynamic factors for univers-

ity good, but there are certain’

elements of the current student
movement which advocate such
unrest as means toward total
disruption and destruction.”

He said that some views cir-
culated by Students for Demo-
cratic Society and the National
Student Association “reflect

goals of extreme negativism and
anarchy which, if assiduously
pursued, could make the Berke-
ley episodes seem like m-ere
warm-up exercises.”

Dr. Allen Wallis, president of
the University of Rochester,
said in »a paper prepared for the
conference thatlthe student act-
ivist movement has undermin-
ed the freedom of present con-
troversial views on campus ex-
ists at few institutions of high-
er learning.

“Stokely Carmichael can speak
without hindrance, but George
Wallace creates so grave ta -tzhreait
of disorder as to preclude the
possibility that he would be list--
ened to calmly and fairly. Sen-
ator Fullbright would be given
a respectful hearing -on my cam-
pus; few wouuld dare -invite Sec-
retary McNamara, since  ap
pearance would almost certain-
ly precipitate tensions, probably
protests, and possibly disorders
that would prevent free and
open discussion. Timothy Leary
enjoys freedom of speech on
most campuses, J. Edgar Hoov-
er on few; Nelson Rockeleller
and Robert Kennedy on many,
Richard Nixon and Huberit Hum-
phrey on few,” Dr. Wallis wrote.

Dr. Wallis said administrators
cannot take "steps to preserve
genuine freedom .of speech for
unpopular speakers “without in-

curring the charge of suppres-'

sing free speech.” _
Despite these reservations, the

, overall-l sentiment among the edu-

cators was that students play a
roll in the decision making pro-
cess. But there were few def-
inite answers as to just how
students be involved, and no one
came forth with a formula to
define how much actual author-
ity students should have.

In a background paper on
“Th e Academic Community:
Who Decides What?” David
Fellman, professor of political
science at the University of Wis-
consin and past president of the‘
American Association of Uni-
versity Professors, relegated
the role of the student in decis-

ion-making to a footnote. He ex-
plained to the delegates that he
dealt with the topic in a foot-
note not because he doesn’t con-
sider it important, but because
he didn’t know how to define
it.

“I’m not prepared to say how
far we should go with student
involvement, but I can tell you
that we are going to get more
and more of the student voice,”
he said. “Students should be
admitted into p 0 li c y - making
wherever they can make a con-
tribution, but not beyond that
point.’ ’

The students on the ACE pro-
gram responded with calls for
more student power and student
rights. There were frequnt stu-
dent criticisms of the present
leade-rship in today's colleges
and universities.

Former University of Michi-

gan student body president Ed-«

ward N. Robinson assailed the
administrators for their views
on student participation. Admin-
istrators “don’t see the problem
of student involvement beyond
how many students should be
on a certain committee,” Rob-
inson said, while the important
decisions are gen-e~.ra’ll made “by

a small group of presidents and .

vice presidents ‘behind closed
doors.”

Robinson said students should
actively participate in and help
decide important policy matters.

The International Poetry For-
um will present an evening of
“Jamaica Labrish” by Louise
Bennett and Rex Nettleford,
Wednesday, Nov. 15, at 8:30 p.m.
-in the Carnegie Lecture Hall.

“Jamaica Labrish” expresses
the wit, humor and musicality
of the Jamaican folk speech in

, poems which have been written

and performed by Louise Ben-
net, the country's leading enter-
tainer, a unique poet, and a
documenter of aspects of Ja-
maoian life, thought and feel-
ing. In “Jamaica Labrish” Louise
Bennett captures the feel and
substance of city life, wair-time
and politics, as well as the cus-
toms and fobtlies -of -the JIaméaic-
an people.

Born in Jamaica and a grad-
uaite of the Royal Academy of
Dramatic Art, Louise Bennett
has lectured extensively in the
United States and the United
Kingdom on Jamaican folklore
‘and music.

For her contribution to Ja-
maican cultural life, she has
been honored with the MBE as
well as the Musgrave Silver

-Medal, a Jamaican award.

Rex Nettleford, also a naitive
Joamaaican, has written the notes
and introduction to Miss Ben-
nett’s book and has many times
collaborated with her in her
stage appearances both in Ja-
maica and abroad. A keen stu-
dent of Jamaican folklore, Net-
tle-ford has used much Jamaic-
an material in the dances in
creates for the Jamaican Nation-
all Dance Theatre o-f which he is
the co-director. He works as a
full-time member of the aca-
demic staff of the University of
the West Indies where he heads
the Trade Union Education In-
stitute in the Department of Ex-
tra Mural Studies.

Tickets are available at the
SU desk.

.\ By DAN LICHTENSTEIN
One of the most interesting items in the Bag’s End is

the clientelle itself. Bag’s End {is a new store in Shadyside L

that deals in psychedelic wall posters, pipes, insence, colored

glasses and every other legal item that would appeal to .

the long-haired, sandal clad hippie type. It is a “head” shop.

The store, located at 5743 Ellsworth Ave., is owned and -

run by two former Kent State students, John Hensler, 22,
and Mike Tumpson, 21. These two Pittsburgh residents saw “head”
shops in New York and other cities over the summer and opened their
own here on August 1.

“I think when you deal in the things and people we do, you must 

get off the beaten track," says Hensler, and his shop attests to the
statement. It is little more than a dim, bare room with a worn tile

ﬂoor and high ceiling. The walls are completely covered with an 

assortment of some 60 posters. Multi-colored blinking lights hang
from the ceiling highlighting the effects of the colored posters, and
off to one side is a short hallway with more posters wil'dly illumin-
ated by ultra-violet lights.

At the back of the shop is an ordinary display case featuring
an extraordinary display of goods: small metal pipes for smoking
marijuana, insence burners, peacock feathers, necklaces and assorted
trinkets much like those that were used to buy Manhattan Island,
everything and anything for the true “head.”

“We are doing rather well,” adds Hensler. The posters are the
most frequently purchased item, and they go for about $2.50 each.
But Bag’s End is branching out to sponsor light shows at nearby fra-
ternity houses and coffee shops and as far away as Ohio State.

Other “head” shops exist in Cleveland and New York, but Hens-
ler feels that Bag’s End’s wide variety of posters and complete line
of pot smoking accessories makes it the biggest such shop in the East.
He maintains that Bag’s E.nd has a great following out of state.

But Bag’s End was originally set up as an environment, not as
just a retail store. Hensler feels there must be such an environment
for our own age group. He claims that there is an individual sense

» to be found in the psychedelic posters, and he sells only those that he

feels have this sense. They, like almost all of the store’s wares, are
made in San Francisco-. Scenes of the Haight-Ashbury district are
typical. But more numerous are the wildly colored and mu1ti-expo-
sure photographic posters with captions such as ,“We’re All Mad,”
“Thou Shalt Not Kill,” “Welcome Hippies” and, of course, “Love.”

The clientel of Bag’s End is primarily local college students. But
people of all ages go into to brouse, and grade school children often
enter the store and peer about in curiosity. It is in these children,
according to Hensler, that the future lies. “This whole psychedelic
thing is like a social revolution, and it will happen in spurts for the
next 10 or 15 years until there is a big change in this country.”

He sees no end to his business according to the attitudes of peo-
ple now, and his plans for the future include a complete candle
works in the present shop and a new Bag’s End in Columbus, Ohio.
Hensler feels that the young people he deals with in his shop will be
taking over the economy in a few years. He seems to be reaping the
first benefits.

Students for Peace Continue Protest

Against ROTC Academic Standing

“lntellectualism, not mil-
itarism,” could easily be the
theme of the continuing
protests organized by Stu-
dents for Peace (SFP)
against the presence of the
:Arm=y and Air Force Re-

 

serve Officers Training
Corps (ROTC) in the Uni-
ivensity.

“We believe that teaching peo-
pie to kill other people should
not be a part of the curriculum
of an institution dedicated to
the development‘ o-f thinking
minds,” stated an SFP spokes-
man at Tuesday's confrontation.

While ROTC is not compul-
‘sory at the University, the
courses offered still carry credit
towards graduation. In addition,

- two years of ROTC are permit-
ted male undergraduates in lieu
of -the required one year of phy-
sical education, the SFP repre-
senative pointed out. “By al-

lowing military studies to re-
place other courses in a stu-
dent's program, the University
administration is tacitly condon-
ing the study of warfare and
death.”

One of the arguments ad-
vanced for the existence of
ROTC is that all males must
serve in the armed forces at
some time and that they might
as well be officers. However,
men can apply for, and receive,
conscientious objector status
and serve a two year period of
alternative service, according to
the SFP ‘spokesman.

For those students who de-
sire to become military officers,
the government has established
programs within the armed
forces which lead to a commis-
sion. O-ne of -these is Officers
Candidate School, for which
qua-lify. Other graduates, chief-
most -male college graduates can
ly in the professions, are grant-
ed commissions directly upon
graduation.

Students, Pros Join

“If some people want to be-
come officers in organizations
which serve to promote wars,
we cannot force them to change
their minds,” stated the chair-
man of SFP’s activities commit-
tee. -

“But,” he continued, “we can,
and will object to the twice-
weekly display of weapons‘ and
uniforms on the campus; the
University is not a military‘ ‘base
and should not become one.”

Over 40 people voiced their
objection to ROTC classes on
Tuesday and Thursday. Next
week, and continuing through
the remainder of the year, SFP
will march against ROTC on
Tuesdays and Thnrsdays at 12
noon until 1 ~p.m. For those who
do not want to march, other
members of SFP will be doing

research necessary to compile a
legal argument against the pre-
sence of the military in the na-
tion’s universities.

  AID Laboratory Develops

 Educational New Curriculum

Since October, 1966, -the Uni-
versity through an Agency for
International Development
(AID) contract, has been assist-
ing the University of San Car-
los, Guatemala, in developing an
educational media -laboratory.

The primary function of this
laboratory is to prepare new

' teaching and curriculum materi-

als in collaboration with the San
Carlos faculty. It is also a serv-
ice center for the storage and
distribution of materials.

During the summer of 1967,
two short-term consultants from
the University aided Dr. Mar-
shall Gunselman, chief of party
of the project.

Orville Joyner, from the Inter-
national and Development Edii-
cation Program, spent six weeks
at the University of San Carlos
as a materials production con-
sultant. Joyner and his Giiate.-
inalan counterpart, Edgardo
Castaneda, developed a variety
of instructional materials that
could be produced by the local
center and also helped to inte-
grate the local materials pr.odiic-
tion center into the educational
media laboratory.

Richard Wendell, from the
School of Engineering, worked
with local University officials
to systematize class scheduling,
student registration, and grade
reporting through the use of an
IBM computer.

There were two short-term
consultants from other universi-
ties also working on the project.
One of these was Dr. Lester B.

Sands, professor of education,
University of California, Santa
Barbara. Dr. Sands demonstra-
ted the use of materials to the
various faculties at the local
university and helped them de-
velop exarriples of the different
types of media that will be used
in the coming year. The other
was Dr. Stafford North, dean of
instruction at Oklahoma Chris-
tian College, introduced some
innovative ideas in developing
curricula and instructional meth-
ods.

The University’s commitment
to San Carlos has now expand-
ed to include technical assistance
in the areas of chemistry, bio-
logy, and urban and regional
development.

Der. Tobias Dunkelberger, res-
ident advisor in chemistry to the
Ecuador Project since 1963, has

A birth-control information letter with a male condom enclosed?
Yes.

An anonymous writer at Middlebury, in fact, sent out a letter to
all freshmen girls containing birth-control information. Some of the
letters also included sample condoms.

The letter, unauthorized by the college, suggested that girls who
wished to get a prescription for birth-control pills should assume a
married identity and go to a doctor in a neighboring town. It gave
the prices of certain contraceptives.

Middlebury’s medical director, Dr. William Parton, said that the
information was generally sound. He questioned only one section, in
which the writer implied that any “big—city” doctor could give mis-
carriage-inducing injections.

The college administration has said no effort will be made to
discover who wrote the letter. .

Audio-Visual Education

Horace Mann-Lincoln
Institute of Teachers Col-
lege, Columbia University.
The program will enable Chill-
ren, teachers and parents -to
produce their own ﬁlms and to
‘use a library of thousands of
ﬁlms With a minimum of diffi-

D culty and a greatly increased
"degree of understanding.

In announcing the grant, Dr.
Louis K. Eilers, Kodak presi-
dent, said: “We are told that in
every 10 years the amount of
knowledge is doubled. There-

ﬁfore, we need every teaching

lt‘O‘0l]. we can use, including the vi-
tal tool of photography. Yet it is
«important to note that ‘the role

A ’ of the teacher, the person who
. --must make proper use of "these
' . 1tools in chranneling all this new

knowledge remains paramount.”
Professor Louis Forsdale of

V Teachers College, director of the

Project in Educational Com-
.munication, and a staff drawn
from the community, the schools

 i and Teachers College will ad-

minister the program.

The Horace Mann-Lincoln In-
stitute is a privately endowed
‘inst'i'tu~te of Teachers College
which develops, tests, and makes
available to schools" new educa-
tional programs. The Project in
Education-al Com«muni'cation was
established in 1960 under the

4 direction of Professor Forsdale.

“At that time we began to ex-
pore eight mm ﬁlm lalS a pro-

fessilonail medium to make the
moving image a much more cen-
tral part of education-—th~at is,
as a teaching medium,” Dr.
Forsdale expla-ined, adding that
the most used medium of all has
been the printed page.

“The manuscript has gone
from the chained book of the
Middle Ages that few could use
to today’s economical paper-
back,” Dr. Forsdale commented.
“In the same way, we feel it
important to move photogra.phy
into a more accesible, more us-
able, more readily grasped edu-
cational tool for today’s child.”

As the project progressed
from 1960 to 1967, participarting
children began taking movies of
things they saw, teachers -began
making ﬁlms with which to
teach, and children grew in ap-
preciation of the projected
image. '

The beneﬁts of such actrivity
were outlined by Dr. Ianni: “The
child records the th-ingvs he sees.
Then, as he attempts to com-
municate, doe-s so, an-d sees 'his
-communications achieve their
purpose, he grows in his sense
of achievement, and is «better
able to appreciate the attempts
of other peopleto -communicate
to him.

“In addition, he grows in ego
development. He gain-s new in-
sights into himself. He grows in
creativity.

“A child -can learn as much.

from taking a ﬁlm as from
watching it,” Dr. Ianni pointed
out. “Con.t:ras.t this with the fact
the environment from which -a
child may -come is not always
enough to enable him to appre-

case in Missouri, for example,

where less than two per cent of_

draft board members are Negro,
yet twenty per cent of the draft-
ees are Negro. Missouri is the
only state so far in which this
question has been raised.

Finances Adequate:

ButFunds StillNeeded

Chancellor Wesley W. Posvar
issued -his first annual report
last 'I‘~hu-rsday. He stated that
the University is ﬁnancially
stable but still in need of pri-
vate funds.

Dr. Posvar referred to the
new state relationship as a “fore-
runer" of ﬁancial trends else-
where in American education.
“This new relationship by no
means solves all the financial
problems ofthe Universilty,” he
said, ,“but it does provide a sub-
stantial foundation on which to
build.”

He a.-‘ls-0 pointed ou.t that the
University gets less than..15 per
cent of its operating budget
from the state. ‘.‘More than half
of the state aid,” he said, “goes
directly into» a tuition reducti-on
for Pennsylvania students and
cannot be considered a new
source of income.”

A balance sheet in the 41-page

report shows the University
with a current operating deﬁcit

of $7,877,404 as of June 1. Most

of this money is owed to the
Equitable Life Insurance Socie-
ty for $15 millions in loans un-
der former Chancellor ,Edward
H. Litchfield. The University’s
assets are listed at $250 million,
more than 90 per cent in build-
ings and endowments.

Dr. Posvar reuporvted that “many
private donors” have ‘shown a
willingness to continue their
support of the University. “B-ut,”
he lamented, “a few donor agen-
cies which have a policy against

   School Grade
Disappears In College

by SHERYLL ZIPPAY
When I was in high school, I never fully realized how
limited my boundaries were. Teachers, fellow students, ac-
tivities——all these make a high school career a success or a

' failure. I was so sure then that I would always be a part of-

all the security, all the simplicityof a high school world.’
After graduation, though, I could already sense a?"

change. I found I could no long-
er belong to “life” in the same I
old comfortable way. People
change as they ‘get more and
more independence, and the
scope of their horizons changes
with them.

After a few weeks, ‘however,
I knew that even with all its

attractions, high school was no .

comparisoin to college life. For
instance, how does a college stu-
dent feel as he returns to a
high school homecoming? I de-
cided -to ﬁnd out.

Last week, I went back to my
high school stadium to watch a
football game that promised to
be be exciting. Feeling mixed
emotions, I entered the student
gate, searching for a familiar
face. I found several; not par-
ticularly ones I was looking for.
The game was well played, and
it gave me a feeling of satisfac-
tion to see my team win.

But there -it all ended. What-
ever pride I might have felt,
wthastever friendships I might
have renewed, whatever mem-
onies the Alma Mxatter might

»

have evoked were all quenched
by the immaturity and lack of 
understanding among the stu- _

dent spectators. ,

As the game progressed, I
wtched them entertain their fool-
ish notions of their own super-
iority, «succeeding in nothing.
And then—at the end of the
game came the inevitable ﬁghts;
Fights among the players, ﬁghts
among the students; fighting
for the sake of ﬁghltinlg. It was
during this senseless brawling
that I felt the full force of my
useless former idealism thrown

into my face. The victory dance ‘ H‘
was a crowning dui-sappointment, ‘

reﬂecting unsuspecting childish-
ness. ‘
What can you say about illu-
sions that no longer exist? 'I“-he-re
would be a lot of things to say.
if I chose to hang on to them.
Maybe it’s because I’ve out-
grown the protective shelter of
high school, or maybe I've lost
some of my dreams by living

in more reglity than I’ve ever 

faced before.

A11-East Bob Longo Deserv

Needs Great Passer
For All - American

By JAY ROSENSTEIN
Sports Editor _

Bob Longo was by himself, leaning on a car parked
outside the Champaign airport when his coach walked over
to console him. Dave Hart squeezed Longo’s shoulder and

“I’m sorry, Bob,” Hart said. “We just couldn’t get you the ball.”
The Panthers had just lost to Illinois, 34-7, but there wasn’t much more
that Longo could have done about it. He had been open all afternoon.

On various occasions «the Pan-
thers’ sophomore quarterbacks
either didn’t see him in the clear
or threw inaccurately.

Despite fewer receptions, Lon-
go isn't having an off year. Syr-
acuse scout Roy Simmons brief-
ed the Orangemen this week on
the Panther split end, declar-
ing, “Lonrgo and Navy’«s Rob

Taylor are the «two best ends,

in the East.” Yet Taylor has
caught 38 passes to Longo’s 23.

Last week Navy coach Bill
Elias wouldn't directly compare
the two receivers, but he did
say, “I’m not sure Pitt has some-
one to get the ball to Longo. We
have someone to get the ball to
Taylor.”

Frank Cignetti, the Panthers’
offensive end coach, has stated
«that Longo is as good as any of
the ends Pitt will see this year.
'llh<at includes -such Alll-Ameri-
can candidates as Taylor, Mi-
ami’s Jim Cox, Illinois’ John
Wright, W:isconsin’»s Ti.m Mc-
Cauley, Army's Terry Young,

\.

NAVY DEFEMNDERS swarm all over Longo after he catches a pass
during last year's game. Longo is rated with Midshipman Rob Taylor

as the best end in the East.

Penn State’s Jack CuI'ry, and
Notre Da.me’s Jim ‘Seymour.
“All Longo needs is the quar-
terback that each of those ends
has,” Cignetti explained. “Bob-
'by’s so quick and ﬂuid, «and he
reads defenses very well. We
just don’t have the quarterback
to take advantage of him.”
Yet Longo remains the Pan-
thers’ primary offensive weap-
on. “Bob’s our best threat,” Hart
said at the beginning of the sea-
son. “We expect that teams will
try to take him away from us
by double and triple coverage.”
Har-t’s expectations have prov-
en true. Only on ﬁrst down sit-
uations this year has Longo had
single coverage. But the double
-coverage doesn’t usually affect
his pass patsterns. “It just takes
an, extra second to avoid the
linebacker,” Longo pointed out.
“The qu‘arterb1a»ck then needs
that extra second of pass pro-
tection if we're going to clic .”
Longo and the quarterback
have clicked only once this sea-
son. In the victory over Wiscon-
sin, Longo’s ability to read the
Badger defense and to shake
double coverage was put to use
by quarterback Bob Bazylak.
Bazylak -had time to throw, as
well as the necessary experience
:to follow, what Longo wais do-
ing to the defensive secondary.
“As an example of what we
did,” Longo related, “on one
play I came out for a quick-out.
But the defensive halfback nev-
er moved, so I just took off. Baz
picked it up and we got a long
completion. Usually the defend-
ers are worried about me going
deep, so I can execute an out

move. But that time, he just
watched me go by him.”

Unfortunately, the job of Wis-
consin isn’t a common occur-
rence. Longo would lo-ve to play
professional football, but now
he has doubts about ever get-
ting a solid chance, even though
he’s «been contacted by every
pro club except the Steelers.

“I’d like to play pro to see if
I’m as good as Seymour,” Lon-
go conﬁded. “But I truthfully
doubt if I’ll be -drafted within
the ﬁrst ﬁve rounds.”

The frustration of losing has
accompanied Longo since he’s
been at Pitt. He spent most of
his sophomore year on the
bench, playing behind Mickey
Rosborough. In his only’ two
starting opportunities, he spark-
ed the Panthers to wins over
Miami and Penn State.

Last year, Hart insisted that
Longo learn how to block, some-
thing Longo could never do.
“Heck, I can't block on the line,”
Longo would say. “I came here
to catch passes.” The conﬂict

which arose led to Longo’:s “bad ‘

attitude,” and carried into last
spring.

Longo was not mentioned as
a possible A111-East candidate in
the Spring Brochure, despite the
fact that he had m-ade the All-
East team as «a junior. Also be-

cause of his ‘‘attitude,,’’ Longo -

played on the third ./team stlhromigh

why. As a/result, his pro chances
were’ severely diminished.

But Longo won his job back
at fall camp. His frankness with
the press that had gotten ‘him

was still there. But Hart and

Longo both agreed that both of '

tion. “The best part of this season is the five mile early morning work-

outs at Schenley Park. I run re-
laxed, daydreaming, and just

looking at the beauty of the
park,” Jerry says.

When" running in competition,
Richey views the race with a
bit of anxiety. “1 enter the race
with an element of doubt and un-
certainty which makes a win

lmore exciting,-” states Jerry.

In a sport such as cross coun-

‘ try where the spectator crowds

may number in the tens instead

I -‘of the thousands, Richey finds
' that the most important thing is

the self-satisfaction that he gets
from running. “I played high
school basketball in gyms filled
to capacity, but it is the head-to-
head competition‘ of individual

. against individual which stirs me

on to my best efforts,” he philos-

j ophizes.

Richey chose Pitt over Southern
Cal and many other schools pri-
marily because of the education
he could receive here, both aca-

Ldemicauy and physically. He

knew of coach Jim Banner and
decided’ that he wanted to run
under his tutelage.

He feels that he certainly made
the right choice. “Right now, I

can say that I ‘am happy here. I

am receiving good coaching" and
the attitude and good compan-
ionship on the freshman team is
helping me improve as a run-
ner.”

The freshman team and Richey
face their toughest opponent on
Saturday, in the Penn State frosh.
In a battle of the undefeated,
Richey hopes and expects to find
his first real competition of the
season. “The coach and the team
wants this win badly,” he em-
phasizes. “A. good performance
against them will help us in our

 goal for the season——the IC4A

title.”
Richey, who holds the 1967 Na-

tional JC mile championship, is

a cross country runner first and
foremost. “I like cross country

When he is running track,
though, he prefers the mile. He
feels that he may be better at
the longer distance races, such as
the two mile, but he likes to run
the mile. “I feel that it’s‘ more
exciting. There is continual posi-
tion switching, not the settling
into one position until it’s time
for the kick which you find in
longer races," he explains. I

Whether it is in the mile or on
the cross country course, a happy

It’s a shame that the Uni-
versit,y‘.s only winning team
has to perform at the same
time as the biggest of the name
sports. Everybody knows about
the football team's miserable
rulshinlg Astartistrics, but how many
people know that the fureshman
cross-country team is shooting

for the ICAAAA title or that

the varsity team is having its
best season in years.

As usual, the cross-country
team is short on bodies. Fortu-
nately, the ﬁve the University
has are all good enough to give
the team a 5-2 record. One of
the best runners is Ken Law-

made many headlines in the last
two years. But he is currently
running second only to Paul
Greig and ﬁnishing high in

Lavvvton is one of those quiet, ef-
ﬁcent athletes who does his job
well and never gets the write-
ups.

The University is lucky to
have him. As a. junior at Balti-
more's Dundalk High, Lawton
ran second to Dave Patrick, the
Villa-nova star, in the state’s
mile championship. His high
school mile, half mile and two
mile records still stand.

As a frreslhmaan and only ‘schol-

His indoor track season was
marred by recurring illness.

But. Ken is a much happier

Like every other runner in the
University, h-e attributes team
success to coach Jim Banner.
“It’~s Banner’:s second year as
coach, and he's working us hard,
but not as hard as last year.
Thartﬁs why the team ‘is doing
better. We're .-happier.”

The indoor season comes next

other runners will probably give
the University another unsung,
but successful team. They still

Leading the Lions are Al Sheaf-

‘Pitt News’ Analysis
Redshirt Ruling
Should Be Changed .

Frank Carver leaned back in his big swivel chair and
smiled. But, .it was a painful smile, not a pleasant one.
Carver was discussing red—shirting, and this is not one of
his favorite subjects. .

For four years now, Carver has sat in his office on
the hill and surveyed the destruction of Pitt football. Dur-
ing that span he has made one significant policy change——
the hiring of Dave Hart.

He has not changed the real villian in the situation;
the archaic non realistic regulations which chain the Pan-
thers to perpetual m-ediocracy. ‘

AND HE HAS STUCK to his gulns. He staunchly de-
fends his redshirting ‘policy, and he staunchly defends the
limit on scholarships.

He defends them on the grounds of academic excel-
lence. And, he defends them despite a mountain of evi-
dence to the contrary, the most prominent of which can
be seen on almost any Saturday in the fall at the Stadium
which his office overlooks.

“We had to decide,” Carver says, “whether we were '

running an educational institution or a football factor..”
This is his stock answer.

IT IS NOT SUFFICIENT. If the carnage on Cardiac
Hill is not enough to convince one of this, other evidence
will. *

It is true as Carver says that redshirting can be an evil.
It can turn a school into a football factory if practiced
indiscriminately like at Arkansas, Texas and many other
schools.

But, red—shirting is not an evil in the limited use back-
ed by Dave Hart.

“IF YOU HAD FIVE boys a years,” says Hart, “then
you’d pick five boys who would help the program, and’yv>ho
themselves need and ‘would beneﬁt by the extra year.

“It’s not a one-way street. There are a lot of guys who
want it and who need it.” Hart is backed up by both statis-
tics and the Athletic De-partment’s own policy.

A survey at Oregon State showed that 600 of 2,000
stuldents needed more than four years to graduate-

LARRY CSONKA
The Man To Stop

 
 

Cats’ Cry: STOP Csonka;
Hart Heats Surprise Dish

By GEORGE LIES
Associate Sports Editor
When Dave Hart talks too much, football people be-
come wary. They know he’s up -to something. Take this

week for instance.

Hart was not talking about what the Panthers had -planned for
Syracuse in the Homecoming game tomorrow at 1:30 p.m. in the Sta-
dium, but rather he lingered on the “challenge ‘of a strong Syracuse

team.”

In practice, he stressed the
point that Syracuse had allowed
just 1.2 yards a carry against six
opponents, including Penn State
who gained the most in one game,
88 yards.

He pointed out that Syracuse
stopped the Jungle Cats last year,
and held the rushing game to
nine yards net.

In public, Hart glamorized Lar-
ry Csonka, at times, the only
offensive Syracuse threat. Hart
couldn’t let coach Ben Schwartz-
walder know what the Panthers
had planed, in trying to stop
Csonka. Except Hart’s entire
game could be titled—Stop Cson-
ka.

“Syracuse lines up in as many
as eight offensive formation,”
said Stan Zajdel,” but it doesn’t
matter, because wherever Csonka
is, he will get the ball.”

Csonka. who gained 76 yards
against the Cats last year when
the defense was concentrating on
Floyd Little, must be held to a
miminum of yardage.

 

BOB ELLIS ,
il)eﬁensi1>e Tackle _

  

Thus Hart may revert from his
standard 4-3 defense to a five
man front. He may be forced to
use three tackles on the line,
and the move of Mike Mancuso
to first team defense indicates
this. _

Last week against Navy, the
Panthers’ young players grew
up; they deserved the win more
than the Midshipmen. Hart may
feel now the sophomores are fin-
ally using the experience of those
first six games. This may be the
surprise for Syracuse; the Pan-
thers are confident now, they‘ve
lost and they don’t like it.

Hart again said he was try-
ing “new things” but he said that
didn’t work too well. He said
it last week, and the Panthers
should have been 3 winner.

One thing is for sure, the Pan-
thers must show that last week’s
game was no fluke, that they are
a football team, and that they
aren’t patsies for anyone, any-
more.

Offensively, again it is Jeff
Barr at quarterback. If Hart's
game plan is to- pass against a
Syracuse secondary, which actual-
ly is unproven because of the
Orange’s defensive line, is so
good, then Barr must show he
can pass. Against Navy, Barr
proved he could run.

And Barr showed he could use
his backfield to score, although
Hart calls the plays from the
sidelines. The tailback, Gary
Cramer gained 139 yards, and
00"” display his broken field
running tomorrow, if the Pan-
thers’ offensive line moves Syra-

_ cuse.

“We’ve had two great scrim-
mages this week. The kids are

really working now] And we’ve _
worked real hard to prepare for ’ "

Syracuse,” expressed Hart. “We
know Syracuse isn’t as experi-

enced defensively as they were

last year, but they are strong,

and they’re big and rangy.”
Physically, the Panthers appear

fit and ready for a Syracuse

team which “punishes you, but _ 0‘

doesn’t make you realize it until

you’re in the locker room,” re-‘:7
assistant ‘

marked Zajdel, the
coach who scouted Syracuse.

George Medich, the tight end

had been down with the flu, but

Hart said the -6-5, 228 pounder I

will play. Sophomore fullback
John White will be ready, but he
has seen no action since the
UCLA game when he broke his
right hand.

Two other players who missed
the Navy game will be ready.

George Pribish, tailback, and Eu- ‘

gene Yajko, linebacker, have re-
covered from injuries.
Still, the element of surprise

as Hart"‘s way of winning. Be- '

cause of Zajdel says, “Syracuse
IS the /type of team that plays,

about as hard as they need to

win

Syracuse’s running game. isn’t ,”

enough. if the Orange falls be-

hind early in the game. That’s 
Why Hart adds to the Csonlm ,

publicity, and‘ that's why Hart
overtalks. 
This way, Hart hopes football

people don’t pay attention to what“,

isreally happening on the field

SYRACUSE FOCUS

 

Powerful Csonka Tramples

Defenses As One-Man Gang

Offensive lineman at Syr-
acuse, claims one Eastern
scribe, are easy to spot in
a crowd. They're the ones with
the footprints on their backs.
Footprints put .there by fullback
Larry Csonka. '

While this may be somewhat
of an exaggeration. C-so-nka needs
no fantasies to convince peo-
ple of his value as a football

6 _»player. All he has to do is show

them his record.

It's not hard to ﬁnd. Each
week the Syracuse puublicity de-
pantment publishes a sheet on
its “Mr. Wonderful.” And each
week -they have ‘something to
write. Oson-ka breaks records
nearly every time he carries the
ni'gsl_<in—

The 240 pound human dynamo
has already rushed for 740 yards
this year. That's 200 more yards
than the entire Panther team
has gained. He has broken all of
Jim Brown’s records at Syra-
cuse, and needs less than 200
yards to break the all-time rush-
ing mark held by Floyd Little.

» . It’-s no wonder that Orange

coach Ben Schwar-tzwalder calls
 “the best fullback in the
country,” and that that “with-
out him, we'd be in real trouble.
Panther coach
Dave Hart and
assistant coach
Stxan Zajdel,
who scouted
Syracuse, agree.
“He’s like a
Sherman tank,”
Z'ajdel says.
And I-lart adds
that “Osonka is

 

CASSATA
the most important one player
to a 7team as anyone I've ever
seen.”

Although Csonka can be ex-
pected to carry the ball close to

half the time tomorrow, the
Orangemen have some other of-
fensive threats who impressed
Zajdel. The most dangerous of

-» these is quarterback Rick Cas-

sata.

Cassata was not even sup-
posed to play this year. All sum-
mer the attention of the press
focused on sophomore Rick
Panczy-szyn, the new “Mr. Every-
thing.” But, when the Orange
got in trouble they went to the
experienced Cassata, and he's
been there ever since.

A fair passer, Cassata is most
dangerous as a runner. His big
--play is a fake to Csonka -on the
belly series, and a rollout around

' end. This is one of the Ora~nge’.s

favorite third down maneuvers.

“He’s consistent,” -says Zaj-
del. “He is a very ﬁne third
down quarterback. He won't

fold under pressure.”

The other members of the

backﬁeld will _be soph Bill Dur-
ing at tailback and senior Tom
Coughlin at wingback. During
gained 39 yards against Penn
State last week. In reserve will
be Oley Allen. He “has never
lived up to his potential,” ac-
cording to Zajdel, but he is an
 explosive type
runner who can
break open‘ a
game.

As alwmayls,
the Orange of-
fensive line will
be unbalanced.
It is a typical
Syracuse line

COUGHLIN in that it is big,
powerful, and slow. But, it is
not of Schwartzwialder’-s better
groups, an.d he knows it. “That’:s
what makes Csonka’s perform-
ance all the more tremendous,”
he :states. “He has -done it des-
pite how poor our blocking has
been.”

One explanation may be that
Syracuse has seven new start-
ers on that line. Five of last
year’s regulars are gone, and
the other two have -switched
positions. Former tight end Ed
Nowicki is now a tackle, while
tackle Ed Schreck is the‘ weak
side guard. There are three
sophomores on the line, adding
to Schwratzwa.lder’s woes.

The defensive line  another
story. It is probably the best in‘
the nation, and has the «statistics
to back up that claim. In 213
rushing attempts, the Orange
has allowed only 279 yards.
“Art Thoms is the best there is”
boasts Schwvartzwalder about
one of his tackles. The other,
Dennis Fitzgibbons was All-Eaast
last year. He has just returned

 

Alﬁe.

Best Choice

to the defense afterplaying Olf-
fense at the start of the year.
When the Orange lost middle
guard Gerry Beach, out with a
broken leg, they lost their best
pass ru-saher. “Our pass rush has
been poor ever since,” says pub-
licist Larry Kimbeﬂ. But, Beach"-s
replacement Willie Smith is ex-
cellent agiainsit the running game.
The defensive line -is relative-
ly small, averaging around 210
pounds per man. But, it has
proved itself, and the Panthers
 - can expect to

take few liber-

   
   
 
   
  

Adding to
the strength
' againsrtthe run-
ning game is
the defensive
backﬁeld. They
are all big, and
are «adept tack-
lers. Safety Tony Kyasky is an
All-America candidate.

The strategy of Syracuse re-
mains as it has always been.
Wear down a -team; beat them
physically in the ﬁrst half, then
win the game in the second. But,
this is not a great Syracuse
team. One thing that Z-ajdel
noted is that they seem to play
“only as hard as they have to.”

Thus, against Maryland (0-6)
they won only by four points.
The beat a poor Baylor team by
seven, and a fair California team
by six. And they have been beat-
en by Navy and Penn State.

Still, they have Larry Csonka.
And so far hehas been enough
to post those four wins.

Csonka was born Dec. 25, 1945.

Fears Coaches

“Moustachio” Nervous

George “Moustachio” Lies clings to his Yogi lead going
into this week’s action, but he can hear the footsteps of

those closely pursuing him. “I’m not worried,” said the Moustache as
he alternately wiped his heavily perspiring brow and made his choices.

“I am great,” he continued. “I
can not lose.”,' Then the Mous-
tache uncrossed his fingers and
reached down and uncrossed his

toes.
Mike “Hawk” Brourman, the
greatest of “Moustachio” tor-

mentors vowed that “I’ll make ,

molasses out of the Moustache."
Hawk was the picture o-f brazen
confidence in his paisely tie,‘po1-
ka-dot shirt, and split-pea soup
colored pants.

He left chanting “A&M can’t
lose. Rice can't lose. I cau’t lose.”

In his way out, the “Hawk”
tripped over Jay “Flatbush’ Ros-
enstein. The Kid from Brooklyn,
still down in the dumps with his
poor showing was on all fours
exclaiming, “You must crawl be-
fore you can walk!”

Many doubt that the Kid can
do either, considering his Yogi
picks. But “Flatbush” was un-
perturbed. “I am a second half
player,” he insisted. Could the
half that is missing be his brain?

Although “Hawk” and “Flat-
bush” did most of the boasting,
the “Moustache” was even more
concerned about the coaches. “The
“Hawk” doesn't stand half a
chance and “Flatbush" can't even
stand. Only the coaches stand be-
tween me and my fifth of whis.
key.”

To combat this threat, rumor
has it that “Moustachio” has been
secretly sending brainwaves to
the coaches subconscious minds,
saying “Navy over Notre Dame!
Navy over Notre Dame!”

Unfortunately, they‘were inter-
cepted by “Flatbush” who went
with the Middies. .

The clod who picks the games
for the week had a hard time
finding a girl this week to pick.
As a matter of fact, he has a
hard time finding a girl any
week, for anything.

Finaly, he convinced an at-ﬁrst
unwilling Roberta Weinruch to
make the choices. “I don't really
want to do this,” she said. “I
wonder how they ever thought
91 me?’-’ .

   

Raw Lion
Substance
F ills Hawks

With Pro scouts from all
over the country covering
on Pittsburgh, the Pitt News
Hawks held their last practice
Thursday afternoon in prepara-
tion for the 46th annual Toilet
Bowl Game Sunday at Schenley
Oval.

“We were going to have it at
-Forbes Field,” Jay “Flatbush”
Rosenstein said, ‘fburt there isn’t
enough seating capacity for the
huge crowd that turns out every
year.” ,

Alt='hou-gh “Flatbush” wlas-nit
talking about the game plan
(“If Lombardi doesn't talk, Why
should I?” he asked), word has
leaked out about the Hawks
fabled “Naclhvt und Nrabel” play,
the one that Gale Sayers wasn't
fast enough for. “I really can't
talk about it,” one of the Hawks
said between beers, “but after the
lateral to the ref, the play gets
quite complicat .”

Standouts at the practice in- S

eluded John “Physique” Selisky,
who successfully made the trans-
ition from throwing in front of
the mirror to throwing in front
of the ﬁerce Hawk rush. “It must
be my physique,” he said.

The Hiawks, who have been
eating ﬁve pounds of raw 1..-ion
meat each day, are built up and
ready to go. “And Why not,”
Paul “Wrong Way” Stoller said,
“if we don’t win, ‘Beulah’ is go-
ing to make us eat this disgust-
ing stuff next week too.”

However, rumblings of discon-
tent have been heard from the
Panthers. “How come those guys
get so much space in the sports
page?” several of them asked.
With players like Dan “the Ham.
on” Booker and George “Musta-
chio" Lies on the team, Notre

 Coach Lewis Likes Progress

by JERRY L. GRUEBEL

The freshman football
team has played two games;
they’ve won and lost. Al‘-
though a .500 percentage is noth-
ing to brag about, the talent
and the progress that «they've
made is.’-

“They’ve improved,” claimed
coach Darrel-l Lewis. “They're
a winning team and they’ve pro-
gressed along those lines.

In their ﬁrst game, the fresh-
men won, and they won brig.
They beat VVest Virginia, 36-2.
Their offense was overpowering
and the score proved it. Lewis
was disappointed by the defense,
'but they didn’t give up any
poinlls.

“The defense made a lot of
mistakes,” criticized Lewis after
the game.

But the mistakes didn't hurt.
And then the talenlted freshman
had three weeks to correct their
mistakes. They showed progress
daily, but by game-time three
starters (Tom Porreca, Jerry
Leary, and John Wozniak) were
sidelined with injuries. And by
the thsirrd play of the game, full-
back Tony Esposlito was also
on the shelf. The freshmen lost

“We want to win,” says Lloyd
Weston. “We want to win bad-

Returns Wins for Phi Ep

season. Three of the four games played resulted in close

victories.

Dorm Wins

by CHUCK DWORAK

Stratford House and Pan-
ther House remained unde-
feated Tuesday in the bus-
iest day of the Dorm football
season. Stnatfo-rd rolled to its
third straight win, beating Plea-
sure. Palace, 26-7, and Panther
squashed Mad, 26-14. Sutherland
edged Litlchﬁeld, 12-8, and Ran-
dom shut out Playboys’ Pent-
/house, 6-0, in other games.

Quarterback Nick Gervase
t-eamed with Steve Solnok-i to

My spark Stratford’s wlin. Solnokli

took a handoff from Gervase
and ran 50 yards for a touch-
down in the ﬁrst period. He
then ran a two-point «conversion.
Gervlase threw a ﬁve-yard touch-
down pass to John Overdorff
later in the same period to make
the score 14-0.

In the third period Gervase
-hit Solnoki with a ten-ylard pass
for a third touchdown. A hand-
off and a 30-yard run by Sdlnoki
late in the same period made
the score 26-0. Stratford, in win-
ning, has earned a place in next
Tuesday's semni-ﬁnal round of
the Dorm football tournament.

Panther House scored two
touchdowns in the ﬁrst period
and two more in the third per-
iod in its win over Mad. uPan-
ther has won three games and
has also captured a .spot in -next
week’s semi-ﬁnals.

A six-yard pass from Steve
«Cundvra to Dave Kitzes in the

,ﬁrst peri-od led to the only

touchdown in Ra.ndom’s win.
The victory made Random two
and one on the season and elim-
inated the Playboys from fur-
ther competition.

Sutherland came from an 8-0
deﬁct to record its win. Ditdh-
ﬁeld scored in the ﬁrst quarter
when Bob .Volkin took a TD
pass from Mike Gordon. Gor-
don then ran for a two point
conversion. Sutherland came
back in the same period when
Emill Spadafore ran for a touch-
down. In the second quarter
Charlie Hall returned a punt for
the touchdown which provided
the winning margin.

Epsilon beat Phi Gamma Delta,
11-0, and Zeta Beta Tau edged
Sigma Chi, 12-6. The Sigs’ loss
was their second of the week.
Delta Tau Delta romped over
them, 25-6, earlier in the week.

Phi Ep won a defensive bait-
tle in which both offenses were
held scoreless. The only sco-ring
came on run-backs. Art Villa
returned a second half kickoff
for a touchdown and Sandy
Warren took a punt and ran for
six points in the same half.

The -second defeat of the Sigs
was due to a come-from-behind
effort by ZBT.

Joe James’ TD pass to Dave
Wierszma gave the Sligs an ear-
ly‘ 6-0 lead.

ZBT came back to tie the
-game and won on a second half
touchdown aerial from Dave
Friedman to Tom Geiger. It was
GeigeIr’s second TD catch of the
game.

However, the «Sigs didn’t have
it as clos.e in their ﬁrst loss. The
Delts were led by John Ander-
son, Doug Bethke, and Chuck
Wilson in their "decisive triumph.
Each of these players scored
key TDs.

The Sigs’ only mark in this
game came on a James to Pete
Keller TD ﬂing.

A player was also lost in this
game. John Bowley of the Sigs
-suffered a torn liglamenst. This
was the ﬁrst lasting injury of
the touch football season.

In the only League “B” game
played, SAE won after a slight
4-0 halftime lead. Two ﬁrst half
safeties were scored as Greg
Shultz, Harry Stump, and Art
Fleming performed strongly on
defense for SAE.

The only offensive score came
on a 20-yard TD pass from quar-
terback Rich An-dolina to Dev
Lemestelr.

The Fiji's were eliminated due
to the blankling which was their
second defeat.

After graduation, what?

 

111 you begin your career as an ,

engine er or scientist or return to
seho 01 for an advanced degree?

You can do both at NOL

 

If you are an engineer in the top third of your class or a scientist in the top quarter  
of your class, NOL offers you the opportunity to begin your career in one of the world's
great laboratories and, at the same time, go ahead with your plans for graduate study.

NOL is a laboratory in the true meaning of the word, and
one of the largest and best-equipped laboratories in the
world. It is the nation's leading R&D establishment for
Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW), the Navy's principal high
speed aeroballistics activity, and a leader in the develop-
ment of new air and surface weapons. The spectrum of
research at NOL ranges from nuclear effects to acoustics
to explosives and materials. At NOL, weapons development
is carried through from inception to design to prototype
test and development. Since 1950, NOL has completed 209
new weapons and devices such as SUBROC, nuclear depth
bombs, mines, projectile fuzes, underwater -detection sys-
tems, and components and design data for POLARIS,
TARTAR, TALOS, TERRIER, ATLAS and TITAN missiles. A
civilian staff of over 3,000 people includes more than 1,000
professional engineers and scientists—-experts with na-
tional and international reputations. Extensive and unique
facilities embrace wind tunnels operating to Mach 17,
hypervelocity ballistic ranges, the world's most exceptional
hydroballistic facility, shock tunnels, 300g centrifuge . . .
multi-million-dollar experimental facilities.

Here is your opportunity. Each year, NOL interviews out-
standing engineering and science graduating students.
Selects the handful that seems to be really creative. Takes
them to its beautiful 875-acre “campus” (the front yard

is a golf course) in the rolling hills of Maryland near the -

Nation's Capital. Puts them through an optional one-year
professional development course with rotational assign-
ments to various areas within the Laboratory to prepare
them for permanent assignments.

From the very beginning, new staff members have an oppor-
tunity to contribute directly to significant projects . . . to
be part of an organization where groups are small and
emphasis ison the individual.

NOL offers you a graduate study program that is one of

; the largest and most productive programs in the country.

Each year members of our professional staff receive M.S.’s
or Ph.D.’s through this program. NOL has a significant ad-
vantage in its proximity to the University of Maryland. Many
NOL staff members hold permanent part-time positions on
the Maryland faculty, .and graduate level courses are taught
at NOL every semester. Maryland also offers many courses
on its own campus——only minutes away—at times which
are convenient to and keyed to the special requirements
of NOL.

sile systems, instrumentation for weapons evaluation and .

aeroballistics research, and performance of new concept

Chemical Engineers and Chemists—for research and devel-
opmentpertaining to high-energy propellants and explo-
sives; high polymers; molecular and crystal structures;
electrochemistry; high-temperature, high-pressure chemical

 pk Shimpeno Spurs Soccermen

‘ expected to be ready to go out

 
 

/

By DAVE TIERNAN
Three goals in one game is the most the
soccer team has scored this year. The fact
that they were scored by the same player,
according to him, was just the result of be-

ing in the right place at the right time.

“Anyone could have kicked those goals I kick-
ed,” commented junior Dave Shimpeno, referring
to the three goals he scored in the booters’ first
win of the season last Saturday over Bucknell.

“The offense set up the ball in the middle,
that’s the hard part.”

Dave was moved to the center forward posi-
tion the day before the game with West Virginia,
a game which the booters lost 5-0. This move was
to add a spark to the impotent offense, but it took
a week of practicing with the other forwards for
the offense to reap the benefits of Dave’s offensive
ability. '

“I’Ve been playing organized soccer since I
was in grade school,” Dave noted, “So when they
needed someone to replace Bob (Racunas, senior
forward, who was lost to the team early in the
season with an injury), I guess I got the call since
I can play any position except goalie.”

A scholarship was Dave’s reward for his soc-
cer efforts as a halfback at Springdale High, and
he had been playing halfback since his arrival. He
said he likes defense better, but will give his all
wherever he plays.

  

   
 

“When you’re playing defense, you have ‘the
advantage on the ma.n with the ball,” he said. “The
offensive man has to keep co-ntrol of the ball and
move around the defender. The results are usually
injurious to the man with the ball. Saturday I got
more injuries than I had in the past two years.”

This year’s soccer team was slated to be very
strong in the pre-season outlook, but they didn’t
get the breaks needed for a winning season. Pos-
sibly those breaks, to which Dave attributed his
three goal effort, would have come earlier if he
had been moved to forward in the beginningpf
the season. Not so, says Shimpeno.

“The wing has to get the ball into the middle
for a good offense,” he said. “The potential scores
have been there all year, we just haven’t had any-
one to put the finishing touches on."

Now Dave is in the middle to “put the finish-
ing touches on,” ‘and the outlook for the remainder
of the season is bright for the booters. And when-
ever outlooks are mentioned, “next year” is always
important to a junior. The loss of three seniors is
also important.

“We’ll miss Joe (Kruth, fullback), Gary
(Foertsch, forward), and Pete (Snyder, forward),
but between the freshman team and the returning
players on this year’s team, we should be able to
fill their spots,” Dave said. “I’d sure like to see us
gain a bid to the NCAA finals next year.”

That’s quite an optimistic outlook, but with
Dave Shimpeno putting the finishing touches on
next year, it just might happen.

Booters Seek
Second Win
At Akron

Tomorrow maybe Home-
coming, for some but the
soccer team travels to Ak-

ron U. in search of its second
win of the season.

Last week’s 3-0 win over Buck-
nell resulted in injuries to three’
players, but Dave Shimpeno, Joe ‘
Kruith and Bob Quinlin, who
have seen only limited action at
practice sessions this week, are

in tomorrow’s game.

Akron looms as one of the
toughest fees of the season to}
the booters. James Malcolm, a
transfer from Catonsville Junior
College, where he was a two-
time Junior College All Ameri-
can, leads the Akron offense
with 12 goals this season.

The booters’ defense will re p
quire at least the efforts of
goalie Len Harmon, fullbaclﬂsl
Joe Kruth, Blaine Plolplp, Norm
Roux, halfbacks Erine Mouen
and Bob Quinlin in the victory
-over Bucknell to ‘stop the po-
ltent offense of Akron, which
has scored 34 goals this season.

The booters’ offense, which
came alive for three of the sea-
son's six goals last week, will
have to continue lblall control
and a good sho-rt passing game
and -hope that the blrealcs need-
ed to score will continue to
come.

Coach Leo Bemis was opti-
mistic about the booters’ remain-
ing games and said, “We're go-
