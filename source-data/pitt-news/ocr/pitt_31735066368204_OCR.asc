Agreeon Successor

0 Professors React to Brezhnev’s Death

By TODD ERKEL

It is likely that a collective lead-
ership, will be formed as Soviet
president Leonid Brezhnev’s suc-
cessor, according to Pitt political
science, history and Slavic
professors.

jonathan Harris, of the political
science department, said that the

transition of power to such a col-
lective may have begun before
Brezhnev’s death.

“One of the reasons that a collec-
tive leadership is inevitable is the
difference in experiences of the
major contenders,” Harris said.

Harris cited former KGB chief
Yuri V. Andropov, Moscow city

I Powers ‘Shadow
 Box’ In Arms Race  

By PEGGI FERRI

The dimension of the arms race
has become 21 case of shadow
l)oxiitg—l)otli superpowers are
using nuclear weapons as nieta-
phors for their resolve to fight atid
win it tittclear war if necessary,
according to William Kincade,
director of the Arms (loutrol Asso-
ciation in Washington. l).(I. '

l\'incatle was the keynote speaker
at the second annttal catnptts con-
vocation concerned with the threat
of nuclear war and proposals for
re\'et'sing the arms race. The event
is held at 500 universities uatioti-
wide and is being sponsored by the
l’nion of Concerned Scientists and

addition to local organi/.ations
such as the Pitt Arnis Race Study
Clroup.

"The purpose of nuclear wea-
pons is to ttse them as a political
signal to impress ()ltt'S(‘l\‘(’S, our
allies, and ottr foes. But, in doing
that, the U.S. runs the risk of pro-
voking a fear that can lead to war,"
Kincade said. He added that the
role of arms control negotiations
has been to litnit these l'lSl\'S.

There are two alternatite
approaches to the thallenge of
arms control according to l\'incade:
the popttlar agenda as exemplified

party leader Viktor V. Grishin and
long-time Brezhnev associate Kon-
stantin Chernenko as prime candi-
dates to succeed Brezhnev._

“Andropov has the experience in
foreign policy, but he knows little
about internal production prob-
lems. Grishin has experience in
party organization. Chernenko has
very little economic experience and
a limited knowledge of foreign pol-
icy, although Brezhnev had tried to
broaden that over the last few
months. “I thinktthat if you could
wrap the three together in a bundle
yoti'd have a good general secre-
tary," Harris said.

A group of faculty and students
from the Slavic department,
including a recent emigrant from
the Soviet Union, agreed that
Brezhnev’s death isn't the cataclys-
mic event that Stalin's death was.
They said the Soviet people would
nevertheless mourn the loss of a
leader.

Brezhnev’s performance as a
leader will be judged differently
depending upon his successor,
professor Pat Krafcik said. The
group also agreed that Andropov's
KGB connections could “color his
politics" if he were chosen to stic-
ceed Brezhnev. '

Smith Wants To
Close Geography

Provost Rhoten Smith is recom-
mending to Chancellor Wesley
Posvar that he approve a proposal
to terminate the geography depart-
ment, according to a memo Smith
sent Wednesday to the University
Senate.

In recommending the termina-
tion, Smith rejected the arguments
of a University Senate subcommit-
tee that reviewed Faculty of Arts
and Sciences dean Jerome Rosen-
berg’s Planning Resource Man-
gagement Systems Proposal to
terminate the department. The
senate subcommittee found admin-
istration’s attacks on geography’s
centrality and importance
unjustifiable.

In the memo, Smith said he
didn’t consider geography high
priority, “based on my own sense
of the centrality, importance and
quality” of the program. He noted
that his determination of centrality
is “quite different” from those of
the previous faculty committees
which recommended the continua-
tion of the department.

"Examples of programs I would
consider central are English and
chemistry becuase I cannot see
how one could have a respectable
university without offering gradu-
ate and uiidergradtiate programs in
these disciplines,” Smith's memo
read. “The same is not true of
geography.”

Smith also argued that, “for
whatever reasons,” the geography
program is “unacceptably weak,”
has no current funded research pro-
jects and termination would only
affect a limited number of students
and faculty. .

Geography department graduate
students, however, contended that
the department's problems are the
result of inaction by Rosenberg.
They resubmitted a grievance
against Rosenberg to Smith, which
charged the dean with breach of
integrity.

According to geography gradu-
ate student Vince Gutowski,
Rosenberg told the department in

1977 that he would search for a new
chairman and replace departing
faculty. Gutowski charged that

Board And Allocations
Reach A Compromise

By BRIAN BALK

The Student Government Board
and the Allocations Committee
ended their feud yesterday over
attendance at a conference by
agreeing to send seven students to it
instead of 10, as originally pro-
posed by the board.

The new recommendation was
proposed after the Allocations
Committee voiced their “displea-
sure” over the old recommenda-
tion, said board president Todd
DeLuca.

The board had wanted to send 10
people to the American Associa-
tion of UniversityStudents Confer-
ence next week in Princeton, N.].,
but the Allocatij/ns Committee
argued that only ive were neces-
sary. Expenses for the conference
are covered by student activity fee
revenue. Allocations member
Cathy Marruci said she thought the
board members wanted to go as a
“last fling” before their term of
office was up in December.

Linda Hausman, a current board
member and a central figure in the
controversy, will attend the confer-
ence. DeLuca said Hausman’s
presence is vital because she will be
the only student there with enough
experience to explain Pitt's student

.gQvernm¢trt  ~ 

“vii .:

At last week’s board meeting, the
board rejected allocations proposal
that only five students go to the
conference.

“The decision of sending l0 stu-
dents was made after I attended a
planning conference in Philadel-
phia and honestly though’ 10 stu-
dents fair representa ion,"
Hausman said.

She said she thought the alloca-
tions committee did not make the
“best judgement” on the issue and
were willing to discuss a
compromise.

Allocations Chairperson James
Shelton explained that the recom-
mendation conflict was nothing.
more than a misunderstanding
between the two parties involved.

“We never meant this issue to be
controversial. It was just a mere
misunderstanding between the
allocations committee and the
board,” Shelton said.

The controversy was further
after some allocations committee
members stated their views in an
article which appeared in Wednes-
day's Pitt News.

In the article, Marruci explained
the committee's displeasure of the
board's rejection of the proposal
and she reiterated that 10 people
were still too many to send.

A voice and piano recital feat-
uring two young students in the
Pitt music department, Maritza
Mascarenhas of Rio de janeiro
and Manuel Castro of Costa
Rica, has been rescheduled. The
new date is Thursday, Dec. 9, at
8:30 p.m. at Frick Fine Arts
Auditorium. It is free to the
public.

The concert was rescheduled
due to a conflict with a special
appearance of the internation-
ally famous Spanish Flamenco
guitarist Carlos Montoya.

The Montoya performance,
Tuesday, Nov. 18, at 8 p.m. at
the Carnegie Music Hall, is
$4.50 to the public and free to
Pitt students with validated ID.
Tickets for this performance are
available at the Student Union
Ticket Office.

"When they (cruise missiles)
come into inventory, there will be
no basis for negotiation," Kincade
said. He explained that neither side
would trust the other. A residual
fear would continue to exist that
one or the other side has squirrelled
away 500 to 1000 cruise missiles
which it cannot see," Kincade said.

Specialists, a grotip that iticludes
diplomats, military tneti and polit-
ical scientists, need to recognize the
urgency of this matter, according
to Kincade. “That our strategy has
to depend less on nuclear weapons
is just the tip of the iceberg," he
aid.

Kincade criticized the U.S.’s
reliance on the policy of (leterrence.

“The U.S. has relied increas-
ingly on the threat of nuclear wea-
pons to deter others from attacking
or from following any action that
we don't like," Kincade said.

{I7

This is a policy built on fear,
and, according to Kincade, it is an
extremely uncertain policy to fol-
low. The U.S. does not know the
nature of the leadership that it is
trying to deter and does not tinder-
stand the psychology of the indi-
viduals involved, he later
explained.

A strategy based on fear is all
right up to a point," Kincade
explained, “but there is a crossover
point where you can create so
much fear in an adversary that he
sees carrying out an attack to actu-
ally be the lesser of the two evils.
Feat can get out of control."

He said that his reading of the
Soviet Union has lead him to
believe that what the U,.S. has done
has served less to deter the Soviets
than it has to provoke them.

“An example of this is the
deployment of Pershing II missiles
in Western Europe in I983, a move
that the Soviets see as meant to pro-
yoke," Kincade said.

According to Kincade, the trend
in strategies and strategic thought
has also been greatly influenced by
advances in military technology.

“We started out crudely," he
explained, “but since then, new
nuclear weapons have become
more numerous, more accurate,
more lethal and more precise in
their effects." He explained that
this capability enables those in the
military to think of these weapons
as being more in line with tradi-
tional thinking. He added that
technology itself has changed the
way people think about nuclear
weapons.

“Deterrence as a policy is uncer-
tain and dangerous,” Kincade cori-
cluded. “Deterrence has become a
ritualistic war-daricte played with
very dangerous props.”

By MARK A. SINDLER

“Monsters exist to only be
monsters—to get us. Russians
are monsters, they’re only there
to get us.”

This, according to English
professor and film teacher Dana
Polan, is how people view both
horror films and the threat of
nuclear war. .

Polan spoke at vesterdav’s
campus conyocation on the
threat of nuclear war and pro-
posals for reversing the arms
race.

“In every Japanese sci-fi film,
Tokyo is always destroyed.”
Polan said, “and in these
movies monsters are never por-
trayed like us. They are com-
pletely different, as if we cannot
deal with them.”

Polan went on to say that
films play up a type of cold war
ideology. In the “War of the
Worlds,” for example, there is
never any mention of the Soviet
Union. Only Latin America,
Asia, Africa and Europe are
mentioned, he said.

Most films shown over the
last three decades seem to show
people in a dangerous fight to
the end when catastrophe is
evident.

“Films make" life out to be a
constant vigil,” Polan said.

We have to always be ready,’
they are saying, There is
emphasis _on the pre-emptive
first attack."

What is actually being said to
people, Polan said, is the films

bring up Social Darwinism-— _

survival of the fittest.

Polan said he does not see a
bright future for upcoming
films.

“Films we see today depict
cultural pessimism, ” he said.
“The world is going downhill,
life is headed for an apocalypse,
and disaster is seen as inevita-
ble. Preparation is impossible
and the world is portayed as
chaotic."

In today’s society, bureaucra-
cies are not credible because
they are viewed by people as
only talking, but never acting,
Polan said. Accordingly, films
never show people thinking,
and this, Polan said, is a dan-
gerous form of anti-intellect-
ualism.

“The goal is pre-emptive.

motivation and to get the mon-
ster before he gets you,” he said.
“Films say there is no possiblity
for community and everyone
versus everyone.”

In films, people are protrayed
as not exercising alot of think-
ing, but alot of acting instead.
They do not think their moves
through.

Compromise Reached

continued from page one

Many of the board members
thought this article was an inap-
propriate means of displaying
their displeasure.

“No comment should have been
made,” said board member Linda
O'Connor. She added that the
board has the responsibility to
enhance student organizations at
Pitt in the best way it saw fit.

Shelton agreed that no comment
should have been issued to the
paper, but added that nothing but
“facts” were discussed.

“I stated facts to them,” he said.
“Everything I said was public
knowledge. We knew our role and
never wanted anything explicitly
stated to the writers.

The new recommendation,
which was approved unanimously,
will send Hausman, newly elected
president Mark Downs, Commuter
Affairs representative Lorenzo
McQueen, two appointed Black
Action Society representatives,
Academic Affairs Chairperson
Clair Watt and a newly elected
board member to be selected by

Provost Recommends

Rosenberg withheld faculty
resources and misled the students
by deciding instead to propose ter-
minating the department.

Smith was unavailable yesterday
for comment on the grievance.
However black studies professor
Richard Blackett, who heads the
senate’s Student Affairs Commit-
tee, said Smith told the committee
Wednesday that he believed that
the grievance was unfounded.

Smith noted in the memo that
the department’s decline is the
result of “bad luck and the failure
of bona fide efforts to strengthen it.
He said, however, that “regardless
of the reasons,...it remains true
that, if one is to terminate the
department, this is not an unreaso-
nable time to implement the plan.”

He said the university’s options
were limited to terminating the
department because “the magni-
tude needed to revitalize the depart-
ment would not be feasible or
prudent."

Although the senate review com-
mittee concluded that savings to
the university by cutting the
department would not be signifi-
cant, Smith said the figure noted
the PRMS plan——$l66,000 in
annual savings—was significant.
He added that to rebuild the
department would require divert-
ing funds from other university
areas. I

Alan Lipkin, an assistant visit-
ing geography professor, asked
yesterday whether Pitt would con-
tinue to teach geography courses or
offer some kind of program. He
said enrollment in some geography

courses is at an all-time high.

Of the department’s three full-
time professors, two are tentatively
reassigned to other departments,
Smith said in his memo. Negotia-
tions are being conducted with the
third. Smith did not specify in the
memo whether the professors
would be teaching geography
courses, saying only that each case
would be handled individually.

Debating the Merits of Parapsychology

By RAY WUSLICH

Extrasensory perception, psy-
chokinesis and other forms of
parapsychology are topics dealt
within a number of Pitt courses.
The verdict on the validity of such
“pseudo-sciences," however,
depends very much on who's
doing the dealing.

Psychology professor Robert
McConnell, for example, offers a
one-credit course called
“Parapsychology-a study of
controversy in science." He des-
cribes the course as a look at the
history and ﬁndings of studies on

chokinesis "with reference to
science as a method for seeking
reality and hastening social
revolution."

“It examines how science
chooses problems and
approaches them," McConnell
said. “All science courses do not
do this because they are con-
cerned with uncontroversial
areas of science.

“Students can examine para-
psychology as something pre-
theoretical. We do not
understand the phenomena, but
we know that they occur. The
problems to be solved are differ-

because we cannot produce the
phenomena on demand.

McConnell started teaching

‘ the course in 1973. He said his

course, which is by special per-
mission of the instructor after an
interview and test, usually draws
between 10 and 25 students.

He is the author of three books,
two of which he also published.
McConnell is attempting to also
publish his third, saying that most
publishers are unwilling to pub
lish "serious" books such as his.

A parapsychology course,
McConnell said, beneﬁts psychol-
ogy majors-to whom the sub
ject may be of professional

in learning about scientific
controversies.

McConnell said that, “para-
psychology is the study of con-
sciousness. This will become
increasingly important in under-
standing ourselves. Through
greater understanding of our-
selves, we can find ways to solve
our problems."_ .

lo physics professor Ezra
Newman, who sometimes
teaches a course called "Science
and Pseudoscience," there is not
enough credible evidence to take
parapsychology seriously.

"There are no experiments to
back up the claims," Newman
said. “In 100 years of study there
has not been a single piece of

He said he considered teach-
ing a course that supports para-
psychology claims valuable “only
if we could also teach a course in
Santa Claus and Little Red Riding
Hood."

He said he considered McCon-
nell "sincere but misguided.”

In his course, Newman
explores ESP in the context of
physics and examines the fraud
that has been exposed in experi-
ments on ESP.

Newman added that he
doesn't see the worth of anyone’s
continuing to study‘ para-
psychology in an attempt to vali-
date it.

Opinion

Uniting
Voices

Now, as never before, students must speak out.
As governments stem the flow of tax money into
higher education and college administrators scram-
ble to make ends meet, students may wonder how
they can, make their voices heard when tuition

increases and other important issues are decided.
' There is a place -for student input within Pitt’s

complex administration. The University Senate,

which oversees university policy-making, allows
student representation at every level.

The University Senate is made up of the General

sAssembly, the Senate Council and 14 committees.
The Student Government Board (SGB) can appoint
up to two students to each of the senate committees,
and four of the nine SGB members sit on the Senate
Council. All of these student representatives may
also vote in the General Assembly.

At first, this seems like a significant opportunity
for students to participate and for student voices to
be heard. Unfortunately, the structure of student
representation in the senate makes the formulation
of a coherent and unified student voice all but
impossible.

Rather than resembling a unified delegation, the
group of students that serves on senate panels is
splintered. Until this year, it was common for a
student appointed to one committee never to meet a
student serving on another. The work of several
committees can overlap when important issues are
considered, and so, this splintering seriously weak-
ens the students’ voice.

This year, SGB has moved to unify the student
delegation by calling student representatives
together for meetings outside of senate proceedings.
This is an important step, but theboard must not
stop here. Much more can be done to improve the
effectiveness of our delegation to the University
Senate. ’

First, the board should increase’ its efforts to

. recruit applicants for senate seats. A number of

senate committees now have no student representa-
tives, not because of an SGB error, but because of a
shortage of applicants.

Second, the board should take care to inform the
students they appoint of the privileges of their new
positions. Perhaps the most important of these priv-
ileges, in terms of presenting to the senate a clear and
unified student position, is the right to vote in the
senate General Assembly. One student representa-
tive has commented that he was never informed of
this privilege. It is not clear in cases like this whether
the blame should rest with the student, with SGB or
with the Senate. But certainly the board can take the
initiative to educate its appointees.

The university has opened the way for ‘student
representation on the University Senate. In today's
economic climate, it is important that students take
best advantage of this opportunity.

Let’s Try To Be Civilized

Dear Editor:

While I applaud The Pitt News’
recently adopted policy of printing
more letters to the editor, I ques-
tion the wisdom of The Pitt News

I to print letters such as the one by

Mr. David Gazze (Nov. 10). In his
letter, Mr. Gazze managed to insult
another writer, Peggy Ferri (“she's
an idiot”), her intellect (“a ludi-
” “trash let-
ter"), her friends (“they didn’t have
the guts to take a risk...they
couldn’t cut it in such competitive
fields”), and even The Pitt News
(“individuals lacking such quali-
ties (as possessed by thinkers,
inventors and artists)...can always
find jobs at The PittNews”). Need-
less to say, such personal attacks
are uncalled for and in very poor
taste. ’

Mr. Gazze’s “substantive” argu-
ments consisted of: (1) TV net-
works pay “megabucks” for shows
such as “Joanie Loves Chachi.”
Therefore, the suggestion that
there is no money in liberal arts
careers is not true; (2) “60 Minutes”
interviewed a computer scientist
who invented a device to help para-
plegics walk again. The fallacy in
these arguments are so elementary
that it hardly seems to require
pointing out. While examples are

often helpful in illustrating a
point, they of themselves do not
constitute valid arguments. Cer-
tainly there are millionaire writers,
just as there are millionaire indus-
trialists (and we all know there are
more of which), but the average
writer makes less than $5000 a year
from writing and has to take a
second job, while the average engi-
neer makes at least 5 times; as much.

The op-ed page should be a place
for informed and civilized debate

and not for hurling insults and per-
sonal attacks. It is not only irritat-
ing to read a letter such as Mr.
Gazze’s,’ it is also embarrassing,
especially since the writer is a grad-
uate student. Unfortunately, these
days on the op-ed pages of The Pitt
News, letters such as Mr. Gazze’s
seem to be the norm, rather than
the exception.

Academic Elitism

Dear) Editor:

I write this letter with sad
regard to Peggy Ferri’s article of
Nov. 8 and to any of the “crea-
tive” liberal arts majors who
might share her views:

You had best come to realize
that the liberal arts do not have
proprietary status to intellec-
tual curiosity, and by no means
do they have the only innova-
tive thinkers and creators.

Such a view is, at best, elitist.

I would suggest that Ferri
radically alter her views on the
subject unless she wishes to be
labeled an “Academic Racist.”

Creativity and innovation are
the driving forces in all disci-
plines. The visage of this crea-
tivity changes from one
discipline to the next, but its
essence remains the same. Truly
creative thinkers will prosper
regardless of_ their field and
intellectual curiosity will
always be a very marketable
skill.

It would seem that Ferri’s
brand of intellectual creativity ‘
is curiously limited, would it
not? v

Look Who’s Not in First Place

 

Dear Editor:

This letter was originally
intended to be a reply to E.G.
Heart's letter concerning Dan
Marino, but Pitt has a bigger
problem‘ that needs to be
brought into focus. The prob-
leni has to do with the attitudes
Of Pitt football players asja.
whole, not just individually.
And a very bad attitude it is.

Before the Notre Dame game.
they walked around thinking
they were too good for everyone.
Now that they've lost, they feel
they can do whatever they
please to whomever disagrees

‘ ‘With their point of view. They

didn’t care before they lost
because, no matter what anyone
said, they were No. l and that
was all their talking. Now that
they've lost, they have to use
their strength to talk for them.

Now you might question me,
saying that this loss cost them
the National Championship
(Can it really be a National
Championship if more then
one team can be No. 1?)

First of all, did it really cost
them the National Champion-
ship? Notre Dame went from
fifth to first after the bowls in
1977, while a third-ranked Ala-
bama won the Sugar Bowl that
year. So what if they lose the
National Championship? It's
not the end of the world. Maybe
if they used their heads for more
than hitting opponents, they
would realize they can survive
being less then No. I.

No, Pitt doesn't need a new
offense, defense, coaching staff
or even fans. Yes, fans, we have
men spoiled.':.Vtt¢-ds1r»;t»'i<.€.<¥mV

of these. What Pitt needs is a

for a long time to come.

Israel Coverage: What WouIdJefferson Think?

By MARK A. SINDLER

Centuries ago, the framer of the
Declaration of Independence said
that if he had to choose between
government without free press or
free press without government, free
press would prevail.

Thomas Jefferson wanted
nothing more than the free and
unobstructed representation of the
people. No strangleholds, no
censorship.

No doubt, Jefferson’s concern
for a free press was justified, but

today, perhaps the media have
overstepped their bounds in cover-
ing the Mideast—-Israel in
particular.

When it comes to Israel and its
actions, the American ‘media have
been all too ready to start rolling
the ink. Let’s face it, the U.S.
media—both broadcast and
print--are the most influential
there is. More money is spent here
for the media than anywhere else.

Not only does Israel get front-
page headlines when committing
“wrongdoings" but Arab censor-

ship of western journalists in the
Mideast is hardly subtle.

In 1981 ABC aired a documen-
tary detailing the PLO—Russian
terrorism connection, portraying
Yasser Arafat's guerrillas as close to
grenade-toting anarchists as one
can reach. Yet, after an ABC corres-
pondent was stabbed 30—odd times
in eastern Beirut following that
showing, news president Roone
Arledge did a 180-degree switch.

On a subsequent “Issues and
Answers” segment, Arafat was por-
trayed, interview style, as friendly.

Drinking: Everyone’s Problem

Dear Editor:

It was with great pleasure that I
read Christina Clinton's editorial
on the use of alcohol among col- _
lege students (“This Bud’s for
You," Wednesday, Nov. 3). As the
chairman of the Resident Student
Association’s Committee on Alco-
hol Policy (CAP), alcohol usage on
college campuses is an issue that
greatly concerns me.

I appreciated Clinton's admira-
tion for Skip and Harry as respon-
sible drinkers and join her in
urging students to analyze their
attitudes toward drinking. RSA
has become interested in the extent
of alcohol abuse in residence halls
and, through CAP, is trying to ana-
lyze this problem and eventually
make recommendations on alcohol
policies and educational programs
that will help students evaluate
their drinking habits and help
them become responsible drinkers.

During the past few weeks, I
have discovered that the use of alco-
hol on college campuses is more
widespread than I would have
thought. A National Institute on
Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism
study of Alcohol use on 63 college
campuses several years ago had
these results:

0 Alcohol abuse is a common
problem on campus at most
schools, especially student drun-

kenness and related physical,
social, and property damage.

0 Most students use alcohol to
some extent. Such use is pretty well
accepted as part of “normal college
life by faculty, staff and students.
Surveys at some large universities
indicate that anywhere from 71
percent to 96 percent of students
use alcohol, with most schools
reporting between 87 percent and
93 percent.

“Heavy drinking" was relatively
common at many campuses. One
Midwestern university reported
that 26 percent of male students
drank at least three to four times
per week. However, when the aver-
age amount of alcohol consumed
per day was calculated from three
different surveys, it was apparent
that the heavy consumption of
alcohol on campuses was no differ-
ent from that of adult society at
large. Compared to national statis-
tics for adults aged 18 and over
(HEW 1974), approximately the
same proportion of students drank
two or more drinks a day as did
U.S. adults (9 percent).

0 Many students reported get-
ting drunk either frequently or
occasionally.

0 At most campuses, propor-
tionally few students had been
identified as “alcoholic” or severe
problem drinkers. Many universi-
ties reported the presence of var-
ious resources, such as Alcoholics

Unfortunately, Pitt has no
resource group like Alcoholics
Anonymous. I have found, with
the help of Gerry Kowalski of the
Office of Residende Life, that
many colleges and universities
have a group called BACCHUS
(Boost Alcohol Consciousness
Concerning the Health of Univer-
sity Students) which attempts to
promote responsible decisions
about drinking. As such I believe it
would be a worthwhile addition to
Pitt’s student organizations.

Although the Committee on
Alcohol Policy is just getting off
the ground, I'm hopeful that even
if we accomplish nothing else we
will be able to gain student support
for a BACCHUS" chapter here. I
would encourage any students who
would be interested in participat-
ing in this project to contact RSA.

'1"

In 1981, a mini-documentary
painted the PLO as moderate and
beneficent. Then, the infamous

(“Under the Israeli Thumb” story

on “20/20” portrayed Jewslas hos-
tile occupiers who kill Arab
children.

Arab discretion goes
further.

In May 1981, five American cor-
respondents were kidnapped by the
Progressive Front For Liberation
of Palestine (PFLP) under PLO
umbrella and released within 24
hours after a promise was secured
that the incident would not be
revealed. The promise was kept;
not a story surfaced.

Except in Beirut and Cairo, cen-
sorship by exclusion exists to the
point that western reporters cannot
live or work in Arab capitals. In
1978, the government of Saudi Ara-
bia teetered after Muslim fanatics
took over a mosque, but there was
no mention of this on network TV
for two entire weeks. And with the
“ceaseless” Iraq-Iran war, stories
surface as often as knights in
armor. . I

CVCII

Nobody in the West believes the
Arabs run police states or that they
are not aggressive. This is due to
American censoring through Arab
terrorism. It is not worth a corres-
pondent’s life to dig for stories in
hostile territories.

Yet, it's open season on Israel

whenever it attempts to brush its

hair. There is good rationale
behind that. Save Paris and
Washington, Israel attracts .the

most correspondents, around 250.
Therefore, nothing stays secret.
Given the TV time, it receives
nightly, Israel should be larger
than Asia, Africa and Western
Europe. Why? Network commer-
cialization. The Tel Aviv bureau
provides more news than any other
except New York and Washington.

In addition The New York
Times serves as the daily paper for
news executives every morning and
helps set evening agendas for the
three networks. An inordinate
amount of news heard on the net-
works is based on The Times.

Research has shown that when
headlines for Israel appear above
the fold on the first page of the
Miami Herald, 5,000 more copies

‘ than normal are sold.

 

When fighting in the Middle
East broke out June 6, Israel
initiated the invasion for reasons of
national policy. They could have
fought differently, but did not and
were counter-productive on the

public relations front.

Five days into the war, Israel
instituted a journalist blackout on
the battlefield on the pretext that
some soldiers’ lives might be jeo-
pardized. After that, the media
resorted to finding news on the war
and going to great lengths to do so.
The media quoted several shady
sources and initially set dead
counts and homeless figures at
10,000 and 600,000, respectively.

Jews, Israelis and other suppor-
ters .have to steadfastly assume that
people will always think of Israel
in a groveling manner. They are
prepared to conjure up the worst
picture of the Israelis to portray the
pro-Israel platform in a dim light.

What these people see, however,
in the American press is not what is
actually the case in Israel or the
Mideast.

The media sits readily alert to
stick Israel in the spotlight when it
attacks its neighbors.

Is this still a free press reflecting
truth and fact in a rightful manner?
The responses are heated, the view-
points debated. I can only wonder
what Thomas Jefferson would
think, were he around today.

Panthers To Launch Second Season Against Cadets

A person has to admire Army
football coach Ed Cavanaugh.

violations and an era in which the
main objective is to win a national
championship, (Javanaugh and
the United ‘States Military
Academy have not lost sight of
their role.

“Our number one objective IS
not to win a national champion-
ship," Cavanaugh said earlier this
week. “It's to develop the future
leaders of the militarv-” '1 he mll‘
itary commitment doesn’t include
recruiting superior athletes. That
problem will be evident when Pitt
plays Army tomorrow at Mtchie
Stadium.

“We can’t get the top players,”
Cavanaugh said. “We get the Ivy
League—tvpe athlete.”

That is the type of schedule
Army is trying to arrange. So far
this season, the Black Knights have
faced Missouri, North Carolina
and Boston College, but the only
time Army has been soundly beaten
was against the Tar Heels, where
the Black Knights suffered a 62-8
loss.

Cavanaugh said he wants to dis-
continue the series with Pitt when
the contract runs out next season.

To me, the series shouldn’t be

continued,” he said. L‘I feel we have

a chance to compete against
smaller schools, but we're not in
the same class as Pitt. It's really
tough on the players.

“I don’t mind playing one or two
top teams,” he said, “but not four
or five."

Army is currently undergoing a
rebuilding program similar to that

Lady Panthers Open
Against Tough Foes

By scon DELLETT

Usually, a Division I swim team
would prefer to start off with a
weaker opponent—a division II
such as Slippery Rock for
example—to’ build confidence for
the upcoming season. This is not
the case for the Lady Panther swim
team as they face two of the top
Division I teams in the nation-
Syracuse Friday at 3:30 and_Ten-
nessee Saturday at 4200. Both meets
are at Trees Pool.

Second-year coach Dave Belo-
wich believes starting off with a

--ﬁjtough opponent will make the

team better later on in the year.

“I don’t mind jumping into the
schedule," Belowich said. “It
breeds a false sense of security to do
well against easy teams early.”

“My theory is to swim the best.

possible opponent. I think we

could have gone easier with the

schedule, but this will help us in

thelong run.”

“I’d rather be a medium—size fish
in a large pond trying to become a
big fish than a big fish in a small
pond.”

The makeup of the 1982-83 Lady
Panthers should be different from
last year’s due to the number of
freshmen coming into the pro-
gram. With the loss of six
swimmers and a diver, Belowich
had to recruit a freshman class that
could replace the nucleus of the
best team in Lady Panther history.

“We’re almost an entirely new
team,” Belowich said, “because
the seven seniors dominated Lady
Panther swimming for four years,

since they were depended upon ’

early in their career to help the
team.

which Navy experienced several
years ago.

“They were committed to a
respectable program l0 to 12 years
ago," (Iavanaugh said. “We're in
the middle of that type of rel)uild-
ing program, but it’s going to take
a while to get to that'level."

Cavanaugh was satisfied with
his team’s progress until last week
when Army lost to Air. Force 27-9.

“The loss to Air Force was a big
disappointment," he said. “I hope
the loss won’t affect us.”

Rick Laughlin has been starting
at quarterback—a position held by
two others this season. He has coin-
pleted 44 of I00 passes for 534 yards

while tossing two touchdowns and V

four interceptions.

The leading offensive player,
senior halfback Gerald Walker has

been plagued with injuries
throughout the l982 season which
have kept him from playing a
whole game. He has carried the
ball 87 times for -104 yards and two
touchdowns. His replacement,
Andre Cuerington, has been an
adequate replacement. The 5-10,
l90—lb. junior leads in pass recep-
tions with 20.

Split end Elton Atkins is Army’s
second leading receiver with 17
catches for 340 yards and one
touchdown.

The Army defense suffered a key
loss when linebacker john Roney
sprained his ankle in the Air Force
game. He will not play tomorrow.

The leading tackler for the Black
Knights is defensive back Mike
Williams. The 5-ll, 205-lb. senior
has 115 tackles this year—a sign of
weakness in the defensive front.

Meanwhile,‘ the Panthers are in a
transition period following last
week’s loss to Notre I)ame.

“We will do things the Fazio way
now,” Pitt coach Foge Fazio said.
Fazio refused to comment on just
what the “Fazio Way” is.

“We did things the same way as
we've done them for the past two
years,” Fazio said. “Now, we're 7-1,
and we will change the way we’re
doing things."

Fazio said he doesn't like to play
Army because, like Notre Dame, it
has a rich football tradition.

“It's sacreligious to defeat the
same guys who defend our coun-
try,” Fazio joked. “I like to play
Army, and the fans should have the
opportunity to see a team with a
great tradition play.”

The Pitt ‘Panthers wrestling
team looks strong in the pre-

men and several highly—touted
freshmen.

(Ioach Rande Stottlemyer said
he's pleased with this new found
depth and he expects this yearto be
the turning point with the Pitt
wrestling program.

“This year the freshmen are
composed of outstanding wrestlers
and, more importantly, class peo-
ple." Stottlemyer said.

The Panther 1982 recruiting
class was ranked No. l0 in the
nation by Amateur II’re.s'tling

Men Swimmers To Open Season Against Kent State‘-I

By SEAN BARNES

The Pitt Panther swim team will
open the 1982-83 dual meet season
tonight when they travel to Ohio to
face Kent State. Coach Fred Lewis
is looking at this meet for improv-
ing times.

“I’m looking especially at my
two relay teams at this meet,”
Lewis said. “Fast relay times are
part of my two pre-Christmas
goals. My other goal is to get the
necessary background and distance
yardage in the water. That will
make all the difference come East-
erns and Nationals next year.”

According to Lewis, Pitt
shouldn't have problems duplicat-
ing last year’s results, as the Pan-
thers easily handled the Golden
Flashes 70-42. But Lewis must find
replacements for the newly-
graduated Rick Carter and Sandy
Pidgeon.

“We’ve got a lot of new people in
the water,” he said, “and it’s these
new faces that must win the meet.
With Pidgeon and Carter last sea-
son, I could put them in multiple
events and be sure they’d still bring
home the points.” Lewis said he
expects faster times from the team.

“We've had one practice meet
and two after-practice time trails
already this year, so I’ll know

improvement from my swimmers
when I see it,” he said. “And I

expect exactly that for the rest of
season—constant improvement.”

The diving squad will be split
this weekend with the rest of the
team completing on a United
States Diving meet at Clarion.

Two divers who will compete at
Kent State are John Dusch and
Mark McCormick. Both have an
high degree-of-difficulty list of-
dives, but diving coach Julian
Krug- said he expects Dusch and
McCormick to gain consistency on
both the one-meter and the three-

‘ meter boards. ‘

Mike McCalley, Todd Mulzet
and Jeff Luffey will accompany
Krug to Clarion.

Krug has been impressed with
the freshmen so far.

“I’ve seen tremendous improve-
ment this fall in everybody,” he
said. “The six freshmen have been
doing some heavy duty training
this fall and they have tripled the
height and intensity of their past
training. There is no substitution
for time and work.”

The Pitt Panther swim team is
working for one goal-—to regain
dominance in Eastern swimming.
The first step starts tonight at Kent
State.

Jerry Mccrillis and the men’s swim team open the season tonight at Kent State.

field Hockey Team Ends Season With

By TAMMY ANDERSON

The Lady Panther's field hockey
team ended their season Oct. 30 in
Philadelphia, with a 7-1 loss to
LaSalle University. Although the
season was ended on some what of
a sour note, the Lady Panthers
posted several admirable perfor-
mances throughout the season.

Coach Cindy Baldridge said she
felt that the victory over Indiana
University of Pennsylvania was
one of the biggest highlights of the

l.'§e‘ason. She stated, “Beating I.U.P.

in a flick—off after double overtime
was one of the most exciting games
in the history of Pitt Field Hockey
and was surely a major highlight
in our season this year.

“I also feel that our performance
in our tournament was very admir-
able. Despite ending 1-3 in third
place, we played very well against a
tough_Ohio University team and a
good Frostburg State team.”

After the loss to LaSalle, the

Lady Panthers posted their final

record at 3-8. The three victories
came with wins over Slippery
Rock, I.U.P., and Washington and

Iﬁjefferson. Losses came from Buck-

nell, Kent State, Slippery Rock,
West Virginia Wesleyan, Ohio
University, Davis 8c Elkins and
LaSalle.

Baldridge summed up the season
by saying, “Although we had a very
frustrating season, we.never hung
our heads once. We kept progress-
ing and playing well. Our skill
level and team attitude improved
with every game and by the end of
the season, we were playing very
well together as a unit.”

She added,_ “With a couple of
lucky breaks, I feel our whole sea-
son could have gone in the other
direction."

Two players who performed

Baldridge said “Margie and Col-

the team needed. They had out-
standing attitudes throughout the
season and played consistently
well. More importantly, they
taught some of our younger players
many valuable things. We'll defi-
nitely miss both of them next
year."

Sophomore Terry Zygarowicz
and Freshmen Joann Patterson
and Darlene Wilson also turned in
admirable performance for the
Lady Panthers.

“Terry led the team with her tal-
ent as a player and will be very
productive ;1_e_xt year_ also.” Bal-

came in as quite freshmen, but
made big contributions to our
play.’Both will be helpful next year

Although Baldridge believed the
play of Hall, Ahern, Zygarowicz,
Patterson and Wilson stood out,

solid performance throughout the
season. ‘ I r

_“It’s hard to single out a few
players when the whole team
deserves credit for our season,” she
said. The main force of our season

has been our good team attitude
and our continual ‘progress in
play.”

The 1983 season will bring a few
changes for the Lady Panthers,
who will only see the losses of two
starters. With the nucleus of the
team comprised mostly of sopho-
mores and freshmen, the Lady
Panthers will upgrade the
schedule. A .

“Our season will be a bit more
difficult next year because we are
planning on taking a few weekend
trips, picking up various teams we

haven't played befori:,_” Baldridge I

 

said. “However, with the main part
of our team being sophomores and
freshmen, I feel we’ll do somewhat
better next season because we will
be more experienced.”

“I feel I can predict a .500 season
or better for 1983 because of the
progress we have made this sea-
son,” Baldridge said. “The key to
our success next season will depend
a great deal on what our turn-out
in pre-season is. A good pre-season
will add to the experience we have
acquired this season and will be
beneficial toward our success in
l983.”

Canspikers Win Big East? 

By MARK A. SINDLER

Shelton Collier, coach of the
Lady Panthers volleyball team,
strolled around Trees Hall’s gym,
watching his players begin their
final practice before today’s start of
the Big East Championships at
Providence.

As players ran lapsland loosened
up, Collier said, “When we win
this weekend, it'll only be because
we are ready.”

A very strong conviction. And
judging from the athletes, who
were diving and leaping after vol-
leyballs fired from every which
way, this 35-6 squad knows the
stakes.

The award gained from a Big
East Championship is the coveted
NCAA berth. From there, anything
is possible. This is plain and sim-
ple, and the players understand
this well.

Some have been under postsea-
son pressure before; for others, this
could be the first taste of cham-
pagne. That old enemy, overconfi-
dence, has surfaced before, but the
players refuse to take anything for
granted from now on.

CARMEN TAPIA: According to
Collier, Tapia is the team’s plea-
sant surprise.” "The third year
coach knew she could play at sea-
son’s start, but not how well.

r *-r\
;.‘*\.'v' C‘.

“The two biggest elements she
adds to the team," he said, “are sta-
bility under pressure and the team
chemistry Sally (Gillespie) and her
contribute.”

“She knows when to work hard
and when to have fun. She is
mainly responsible for team
atmosphere.”

Tapia, a freshman from Puerto
Rico, has had some similar cham-
pionship experience before. This
summer, she played in Cuba in the
Central American Games and con-
tributed to her team winning a
bronze medal.

On the Big East's significance,
she said, “It’s important for us. It
shows we can play under
pressure.”

JUDY YOUNG: A starter in her
freshman year, Young continued
her leadership by starting this year
with All-America statistics. Var-
ious injuries have occasionally
stopped her from continuing on at
her accustomed pace, but the com-
petitiveness in Young has far from
flickered.

“She has outstanding spiking
percentages,” Collier said. “Injur-
ies have slowed her, but not
stopped her. Judy's -a tough
athlete—she can weather the
injuries.”

Maybe tough ought to be
Young’s middle name. Collier
ranks her as one of the squad’s top

three spikers behind Diane Zack
and Ulana Kohutiak.

Discounting any letdown possi-
bilities, Young said, “A tourna-
ment of this caliber we have to take
more seriously. Any team has the
potentialito beat us.”

ULANA KOHUTIAK: The
middle blocker has not been with-
out problems this season. Now
fully recovered, Kohutiak sus-
tained ligament injuries almost
two months ago and subsequently
lost her starting role.

She came in the most improved
player from last year and the
strongest spiker because of the var-
ious all-star games she participated
in during the summer.

Now in a reserve role, Collier
said of Kohutiak, “She has no trou-
ble attitude-wise with the transi-
tion, a very dedicated player."

Although no injury is a good
thing, Kohutiak’s absence made
the team work harder, Collier said.
In retrospect, it forced the Lady
Panthers to play better and gave
then inexperienced Pat Belcher
and Sally Gillespie valuable play-
ing time.

DIANE ZACK: Some speak 6i
this senior as the team’s unsung-
hero. Zack undoubtedly symbolizes
versatility and team dedication.

During the last two years, she has

played in the shadow of more cele- ,

brated players. “(Diane) wanted to
do more for the team,” Collier said,
“but couldn't. Now she can con-
tribute, is relied upon and has
responded.”

A leading spiker over‘ the last 20- j

25 matches, Zack had made a posi-
tion change from the right side to
the left side during mid—season,
according to Collier. Her new
responsibilities shifted from block-
ing to spiking opportunities. “My
theory on volleyball,” Collier
explained, “is you have to have the
two best spikers on the left side to
receive the best sets.”

Ulana Kohutiak, who lost her middle blocker position after she
sustained ligament injuries, has adjusted well to her reserve

role.

Zack said she wants to end the
season on a high note. And she
totally discounts any letdowns.

“Everyone is getting geared so
we’re not over-confident,” she said
convincingly. “Against Penn State
(10 days ago) that feeling was there
where we were getting beat. The
team will not allow that feeling to
perpetuate itself now.

“This could be it or could be the
beginning of something special.”

“Extra.Bril|iance.”

“Astonishing virtuosity . . . A Phenomenon!"

“Such consummate Artistry Is A Rare Experience!”
“Roused His Audience To Thunderous Applause!”
__“Subtle, Amazing virtuosity Simply Unbelievable!"

PAT BELCHER: Beginning as
an untested sophomore, Belcher
started 27 matches this year, largely
due to Kohutiak’s injury. She
started out with relatively little col-
legiate volleyball experience, but
she has been through a real learn-
ing process.

. “She’s gotten better every week-
end,” he said.

“We need the help there since four
butterfliers have graduated. Alicia
Dugan has shown tremendous
quickness and ability. She's one of
the best to come to Pitt."

Denise Ricketts is really showing
improvement. She has the tools to
be a good swimmer.

“Georgia Sposky should be com-
bined with Laura Barber to swim
backstroke. This frees Sue Heon to
swim other events, and gives the
team flexibility.”

Belowich believes putting the
freshman against good competi-

Jeff Jelic and Doug Haines.

jelic, a junior, won the EWL
title last year at 158 pounds. He
finished with a 20-4 record missing
All-America status by a single
match at Nationals.

Haines, a sophomore, went into
the finals with a losing record, but
by pinning the defending chairi-
pion, he finished at 8-8-l.

tion early can only help them.

“I expect good things for them in
time, but they have to get expe-
rience in collegiate swimming," he
said. “You can’t explain this
experience——they have to do it.”

Syracuse and Tennessee didn’t
lose anybody to graduation and
both had good recruiting years.

“We will have our hands full
with both teams,” Belowich said.
“Syracuse is much improved and
we had to win some close races to
defeat them last year.

“They have no weak spots and
they recruited a good freshman
class."

After facing Syracuse, the Lady
Panthers must come back the next
afternoon to take on Tennessee,
who defeated Pitt last year and fin-
ished 10th in the NCAA
championships.

“They swam the fastest dual
meet ever against us," Belowich
said. “They lost no one to gradua-
tion and picked up a number of
quality freshmen."

Belowich said that Tennessee is
trying to build its women’s swim-
ming up to the standards of the
men’s team, a program which won
the national championship in
1979.

ady Panthers Toopen With Tough Foes

“They have a good tradition
with the men's program and they
want to bring the women's pro-
gram on par with this tradition,”
he said. “One of their goals is to be
national champions. They have a
huge budget and they’re doing a
nice job.”

With an influx of talented fresh-
men and a good tradition, the Lady
Panther swim team continues to be
one of the top teams in collegiate
swimming.

Wrestling Team ’s Success

Other Eastern place winners
include Dennis Attieyh, _]oe
Throckinorton and Frank Rich.

Attieyh placed third at the tour-
nament last season at heavyweight,
but may red shirt this year, while.
junior Joe Throckmorton placed
third and Frank Rich, also a jun-
ior, placed fourth.

Other returning letterinen

include senior Kurt Karanovich
(190) and junior Eric Lobell (118),
who both sat out last year with a
red shirt, senior john Seuinerj
(142), juniors Dan Kasperkoski
(heavyweight), Craig Richey (H2)
and sophomore Rich Esswien
(ll8).

Stottleinyer said he hopes to fin-

ish above last year's 6-10 record and
fourth place finish in the Eastern
tournament. Some of the Panthers
will get the first action of theiyear
as they travel to Morgantown to
wrestle in the West Virginia Uni-
versity Open tomorrow. The one
day tournament will bejusta small
glimpse of things to come for the
Panther wrestling team.

continued from page twelve
and North Carolina says they
would not have been interested in
Belcher at the start of "the“ye‘a'r.

“She had no teaching,” Collier
continued. “We’ve been patient
with her, though, and she has done
some work on her own.”

JULIE GAUL: Collier ventured
to say that he would call the team’s
captain unreplaceable.

“She is the quarterback of our
offense," he said, “and I consider
her the No. l all-around player in
the East." ‘

Although a “good athlete” dur-
ing her four—year tenure at Pitt,
Collier recalls her as an emotion-
ally up and down freshman who
was plagued by mistakes.

“When she was a freshman,”
Collier ~ said, “Julie was very
temperamental and inconsistent.
Many thought I was crazy to make
her a setter, but she's superior to
others and has gone from being a
spiker to a setter in only two and a
half years.” i

Gaul is the only setter around
that sets a 5-1 offense and the only
one in the nation who also main-
tains middle-blocker duties.

“So far, we've had a successful
season,” Gaul said. “Diane, Robin
(Kukalis), or I don’t want to end it
all with a" loss to Georgetown or
Providence. We want to end the
season against an unbeaten team.

“Winning this (the Big East) is
the most important thing in my life
right now.”

REGINA REYES: Collier refers
to Reyes, also from Puerto Rico, as
the No. 9 player on the team. It has
been a learning year for Reyes. Her
out-front specialty is serving and
“has won some matches for us,”
according to Collier.

With solid Puerto Rican volley-
ball experience behind her, Reyes
is proof of Collier’s bench strength.

ROBIN KUKALIS: The former
Kiski High School star is finishing
out her four-year career as a part-
time starter. Kukalis came to Pitt as
one of the best in the state and has
been a strong contributor to Pitt’s
success.

“Robin’s experience will do well
for us in the Big Easts,” Collier
said.

SALLY GILLESPIE: Targeted
as Collier’s freshman phenomenon

  

of the season, Gillespie hails from a
traditionally staunch volleyball
program. During her career at Nor-
win High School, the 5-4 freshman
witnessed four straight state
championships.

“Sally is the biggest surprise on
the team,” Collier said. “I expected
her to help out a little as a back
court specialist. Now, she is one of

the emotional leaders.” 5-.-..

The shortest player on the team,
Gillespie will start at the Big Easts
because, as Collier stated, of her
defense, emotional stability and
charisma that draws great perfor-
mances when Gillespie is playing.

“We keep her in," Collier said,“
because the team plays better and
no mistakes is the key to the Big
Easts."

Confront. ‘(l with the fact she is
once again it. the playoffs, Gilles-
pie said, “It’s great, something
new. This is different from the past
in the fact it’s the Big East. I’mjust
glad to get the chance to play.”

And play this team will. The
Lady Panthers know what they are
shooting for. If they just aim well
enough, the target will be theirs-
championship and the highly
sought NCAA berth.
