Students, Faculty

Demand Innovation

The “Concerned Students and
Faculty of the University” pre-
sented the - following demand
Monday to the administration:

In the Clarence Beers-Altern-
atives case. the University
administration ruled that it
would not deny a University
employee his “right of con-
science” by directing him “to
perform an act which he be-
lieved to be morally wrong.”
In keeping with this precedent,
we demand that faculty and
teaching fellows be free to dis-
card the grading system at
their own discretion. We expect
a recommendation from the
Chancellor to the relevant fac-
ulty groups to this effect, and
we ask that the Chancellor put
this proposal at the top of the
agenda for the next faculty
meeting.

In response to this demand,
Dr. Charles Peake, Provost, in-
formed the audience that a com-
mittee is currently being form-
ed to examine the entire curric-
ulum and related. educational
issues in the University. He ex-
pressed his support for a com-
plete reform in the present grad-
ing system and suggested that
this committee would be the ap-
propriate vehicle through which
reform could be effected.

While the students felt that the
University has not addressed it-
self to the faculty’s “right of
conscience” in the grading of
students. they do agree that there
is a pressing need for educational
reform and innovation at this
University. They therefore fully
support the commencement of

the study referred to by Dr. Peake.

It should be a study undertaken
with the fewest number of pre-
conceptions and with no debts to
the status quo; a study which
is open and accessible to all mem-
bers of the university commun-
ity; a study which is continually

 This Week in Senate

The newly elected SG Senate convened for the first time Wed- I

nesday evening in the SU Supper Room. SG President Scott Baum
addressed the body and requested endorsement of hisipersonal
staff. New staff members include: Joy Mandel, research sec-
retary; Dennis Deutsch, parliamentarian; Lynne Lupu, record-
ing secretary; Sye Adler, executive assistant, and Sue Whitmer,
executive secretary. The Senate approved the,list unanimously.

' Senators Slyman and De Marco introduced a bill to change the
method of producing legislation. In the past, bills were intro-
duced and acted upon at the same session. Under the provisions
of the new proposal. a bill is to be introduced at one meeting
and acted upon at the next. unless the Senate by a two-third vote
decides that the bill should be acted upon at the same meeting
at which it was introduced. The bill was approved.

The Senate then received a bill sponsored by Senators Sly-
man, Levenson, Cavaluchy, and Gervase, proposing the cancel-
lation of classes on April 7 due to the inconvenience caused by
having one day of class between the end of the only vacation of
Winter Term and the first day of the Reading Period. Action on

' this bill will commence next week.

The election ofthe President pro tem of the Senate was next
on the agenda. By secret ballot, Senator Slyman waschosen.

Baum then introduced a number of committee chairmen
appointments for approval by the Senate. As a result the follow-

~ ing students were approved for office: Stu Lowenthal, director
of finance; David Kuhns, director of public relations; Jim ‘Saun-
ders, homecoming chairman; Judy Lewandowski, chairman of

» Friday, February ‘I4, 1969. V. 

State Rep. Gerald Kaufman (D.-Shadyside-Squirrel Hill) told The Pitt News Wednesday in a tele-

hone interview that the legislation introduced by State Sen. Robert Fleming and State Rep. Joseph Zard
(R.-Pittsburgh) has little chance of becoming law. '

The legislation is geared to provide State guidelines‘ concerning university discipline at state-oper-
ated and state-related institutions.  A

“The Zord legislation will never get out of committee,” said Kaufman. If the Fleming proposal does I 
pass the Senate “the Democratic leadership in the House will never let the bill get out of committee,” said

Kaufman echoed Chancellor Wesley Posvar’s sentiments indicating. that this legislation is politically ’ , 
motivated. _“The sponsors and co-sponsors of the bills (Fleming-Zord) can type up press releases and put 
it in their home town newspaper. This,” saidvKau_fman, “can enhance their local prestige. At the time of re-' ~_~'

..y' The “Conscience of Pittsburgh,”
WIIC Columnist Dave Kelly defended
State Sen. Robert Fleming’s bill‘ to
make students take an oath pledg-
ing to uphold the rules and regula-
tions of University conduct. V

:; Unbeknowst to Pittsburgh’s god-
sent Messenger of truth, Sen. Flem-
ing has introduced another bill gear-
ed to promote a “college rebel crack-
down.” The WIIC News Director, how-
ever, would probably agree with the
Aspinwall Republican’s -latest move
towards usurping University discip-
linary authority. Both men need to
open their eyes.

 The provisions of this latest Flem-
ing Bill are repugnant. One provision
states that any individual who inter-
feres or prevents the conduct of ac-
-tivities or classes is susceptible to a
$100 fine and two months in jail. What
does the good Senator mean by in-
terference?

 The provisions get more repug-
iiant, however. The second part of
the Fleming bill says that during the
S0. called disturbing or interfering
activities, a person who “wilfully
annoys, disturbs, taunts, assaults,
ormolests any student, employee, or
administrator will be liable to a $150
fine and three months in jail. What
'_(_lo'es the good Senator mean by an-
Inoy, disturb or taunt?

 It_is the third and worst provis-
ion that reflects the intent of the
‘Fleming bill. “Whoever in the course
:_of- committing any of these acts will-
fully conducts himself or herself in
,a lewd, lascivious, or vulgar manner
fbyﬂlword or deed could be fined $50
and spend 30 days in jail. Can the good
Senator define lewd? The Supreme
Court can't! , ' .

 If this proposal is passed, a stu-
dent gathering at any spot on this
campus would have to be composed
of clean shaven, short haired, clean
talking, coat and tied people who
.-would say nothing nasty about Uni-
yersity policy. If something was said
«in. variance with the opinion of the
constituted authority, those “college
rebels” would be carted off to jail and
fined for acting in a“ vulgar manner.

_ The haziness of the Fleming bill is
apparent. It is nothing more, in our
-view, than a moral pronouncement
by our Harrisburg mentors who des-
Tperately want to tell all Pennsylva-
._nia'students how to act and speak.
We agree with Rep.‘ Gerald Kaufman
._that the provisions of the Fleming
bill are seemingly unconstitutional.
Can any State authority tell students
at state-related and state-operated
‘universities not to act by word or
_deed in a “lewd, lascivious, or vul-
lgar manner?” This seems to be in vi-
olation of the freedom of speech.

The hope of all the state-related

sand "state-operated universities in
. Pennsylvania rests, it seems, with the

i  Alas Babylon l

State House of Representatives. There
is a chance, according to Rep. Kauf-
man, that the Fleming legislation will
be killed in a House Committee. Our
hopes ride with the responsible lead-
ership in the State House. ‘ —

The Fleming bill represents a se-
rious infringement of constituted
rights. It reveals a profound lack of
confidence, on the part of the Aspin-
wall_Republican, in the University and
its Student Affairs. staff. It represents
a central authority setting up regu-
lations to govern conduct at institu-
tions encouraging free thought and
expression. It represents a central
authority telling a great institution
how to operate.

The Fleming proposal will not prob-

ably become law. We’ have faith in the
leadership in the House of Represen-
tatives to bottle-up this ill-conceiv-
ed legislation. If, on the other hand,
Fleming receives enough publicity
to get “his thing” through the State
Legislature, this newspaper will call
for a student-faculty strike.

And Dave Kelly will be happy; he’ll
have something to distort.

‘Foot’ In The

By DAVID ROSENBLUM
Staff Columnist

Wesley W. Posvar has lied to the stu-
dents of this university.

At the meetings last Friday and Mon-
day. Posvar said that the proposed bill
of Sen. Robert Fleming had no chance of
getting through the state legislature. He
said that the origin of the bill was polit-
ically oriented and that “ V
publicity was probably
one of Fleming’s main
motives. I know he said
this because I heard
him. ’

In Wednesday’s edi-
tion of the Pittsburgh
Press, it was reported it
that Fleming s bill did ROSENBLUM
indeed have a “chance
to be passed. At a session of the state
senate attended by 43 senators, the bill
received the co-signatures of 40 of those
present. According to Fleming. these 40
men “rushed to co-sponsor the bill.”

      

YET POSVAR EXPECTS us to believe
that this bill does not have a chance to
be passed. Yeh. and Truman never had a
prayer.

After Wes tried to sell us on this idea,

the attempted to save his neck by claim-

ing that he never said that Fleming’s bill
was a political move and that it was aim-
ed at garnering publicity; but this time he
said it to approximately one thousand
people.

Posvar is trying to hide behind. his
prominently opened mouth. but no amount
of effort will be‘ sufficient to extricate
his honest (for once) foot. Posvar has
realized that his candidness, brought out
by direct student intimidation. has put
him on Fleming’s blacklist. Fleming is on
the Board of Trustees, and that could mean
Wes’sjob.

BUT NOW IS not the time for the
Chancellor to worry about hisjob. If he
is as concerned about the students as he
claims to be, he ‘must not advocate pas-
sive -resistance to Fleming’s proposal.
If youstudents believe that it is best to
ignore a device that will totally obliterate
the freedom of this institution. you- had
better consult some of the Jews who scoff-
ed at a man named Adolph’.

If you thinkthat I am calling Fleming
a fascist demagogue you are correct. If

i

 

it Over The Edge

s%sWhat’s Rights

 

Mouth Trick

you think that I am calling Fleming an ig-
norant Yahoo, you are correct. This is not
the case of a student rebel demanding for
his right to burn Oakland to the ground;
this is one student calling for his right
to read Alternatives and meet in the Com-
mons Room.

The second section of Fleming’s bill
imposes a fine of $150 and three months
in jail to anyone who (and dig this) “dis-
turbs or otherwise interferes with or pre-
vents the orderly conduct of the activities,
administration or classes of any public
school or college, willfully annoys, dis-
turbs, taunts, assaults or molests any stu-
dent,- employee, administrator, agent or
any other person in a building of, or in
the immediate vicinity of such school,
college, or university.”

 

THIS SIMPLY MEANS that anyone
who attended the meeting in the Commons
Room last Friday could be thrown in the
can for three months.

Now is not the time for the students
at this university to sit idly by amidst as-
surances that the bill will never pass.
We can no longer write this bill off as a
piece of junk legislation. It is, at this very
moment, a direct threat to everyone per-
son connected with this school.

So what do we do?

First we stop our talking and origin-
ate some type of overt action that will
show the legislators that we oppose this
bill. Along with this action. I also recom-
mend that a statement be drawn up stat-
ing that the signed names abhor the Flem-
ing proposal and will NEVER comply
with "ANY of the provisions contained
within the bill.~ Posvar must be the first to
sign this statement.

THEN WE URGE that our Chancel-
lor immediately demand the resignation
of Robert Fleming from the Board of Trus-
tees on the grounds of gross ignorance.

The time to act is now. This bill is a
threat of such magnitude that it complete-
ly overshadows any other demands that
have been made. If anyone would like to
get off of his or her tail and put an end to
this foul bill, Isuggest you contact me
at the Pitt News Office or my home. I’m
in the phone book.

As another American once said during
anothertime of crisis, “Now is the time
for every good student to come to the aid
of his university.” ’

‘The Swimmer’ Loses Out

 

By TOM WALSH
Staff News Writer

Picture an olympic-sized swimming

‘pool. Got it‘? Okay! Now picture a man;

a plumpish man, not too young, not too
old, dressed in dark blue shorty-shorts,
and a white “_T” shirt — with “Pitt” print-
ed neatly over the right half of hiswchest.
Can’t picture him huh? Oh well, no matter.
Picture him padding .
softly, like a sneaky -
barefoot Indian, to-
wards his rapidly-cool-
ing cup of coffee plant-
ed on his desk.

You now ' have a ‘
mental picture of my
swimming instructor.
(If that isn’t enough’;
kindly refer to the il-‘
lustration. )

 

I KEEP ASKING myself if he
can swim. bu_t as he seems to like the po-
sition or authority on the diving board,
all I know for sure is that he is pretty good
at directing body-traffic in the chlorine
jungle.

“Hey coach,” I g a r g l e out at him,
“what’s wrong with my breaststroke kick.”

His answer,“You_’re scissor-kicking, just

like that guy there,” sure did tell me a
lot. I still think “that guy there”, had a
pretty good kick. So I next tried a differ-
ent angle, “Well what’s the right way?”
The now rather disgruntled. (or is it grunt-
ing ?) coach points to another swimmer
and barks “That’s almost right; but not
quite!” ‘

Oh joy! I can now go out and do an “al-
most right” breaststroke kick.

Twenty—four widths later of “Just legs;
no arms.” [I begin to feel like I’ve been

- playing Titanic. But then again, it’s a pleas-

ant thought to know that I will have the en-
durance to do most anything — well it’s sort
of a pleasant thought.

Gee coach, when I grow up I want to be
a swimming teacher too. ‘Cause then I can
stand on a diving board, drink hot coffee,
and raise my middle-finger in a salute to
my fellow coaches too, huh?

As a footnote I would like to add that
this attitude is by no means limited to the
swimming department. When are the ma-
jority of our teachers going to get off of,
their platforms of omnipotence long
enough to demonstrate, and really teach
us; the poor, lowly bourgeoisie?

P.S.gI shall print a copy of my “F” in
y swimming at the end of the term.

 

 

 

 

‘*5 Reflections Of The Spleen ii

The University Game

‘ By MARC SIMON
Staff Columnist

I was really excited about last Friday’s '
rally in the Common’s Room. I thought,
‘.‘Man, for the first time since I’ve been
here people are finally starting to get to-
gether! We’re finally shaking loose from
the grip of apathy that’s controlled this
campus for so long!” Well, I still believe
that is true. But how
important, how signif-
icant, is all this reac-
tion against the ad-
ministration? ’

THE REASON I
ask this is because of
what I saw in the hall 
of the Common Faclili-. '
ties Building Monday
preceding the Chancel-
lor’s speech. I saw a bunch of kids play-
ing something called “the University
Game.” They spun a die and students mov-
ed accordingly over a board with spaces
marked “Joins a Fraternity,” “Burns
Draft Card,” and other college experien-
ces. It was amusing to watch this game,
but I wonder how significant it was.

Oh, sure, it was symbolic of some col-
lege experiences. But‘ how symbolic are
college experiences of “real life’’ exper-

 

iences? What experiences are really 
portant? Are college experiences really

‘just little games we play in our “Ivory

Towers?”

I don’f profess to know what is import-
ant for anyone except me. because every-
one has their own list of priorities. But
I can’t help feeling that the problems we
face at school are miniscule in relation to
the problems of people who don’t live in
the “Ivory Tower” face every day.

HOW MANY COLLEGE kids know
what pain is? What it means to live in a
slum, to be hungry, to be cold? Are our
problems really rather petty in relation-
ship to what’s outside of our world?

I drove a cab as a part time job.,I think
every college student should drive a cab.
Because when you drive a cab, you meet
people —— not “hip,” “Ivory Tower” peo-
ple, but unspecial, every day people. And
these people, for the most part, don’t think
like college kids do. - ~

" They haven’t experienced our point of
view. But most of us haven’t experienced
their’s, either.

We’ve only played the University
Game. And while we continue to play the
University Game, we should remember
that we’ve probably never played the
“Real” game.

!What’s Right

Who  Needs An Army . -. .?

 

Ding. Dong Bells

Editor, The Pitt News,

Let’s abolish the hourly chimes! They
are an affront to the contemporary stu-
dent personality. As an anachronism of a
bygone Pavlovian era, the chimes are
pervasive and perverse remnants of the
offensive high school style of srote learn-
mg.

Also, there are no ideologicalor moral
objections preventing instructors from
wearing watches. If poverty is the prob-
lem, the University or'State, in the name
of Efficiency, could allocate funds for a
supply of $2.95 pocket watches.

As a watch of last resort, student rest-
lessness at the hour’s end can provide
a universal University clock.

I We are all tired of learning to respond
to institutional bells.

According to a survey taken recently, a

By ALLAN SENIO
Contributing Columnist

In light of the ongoing controversy

’over ROTC I believe something sensible

needs to be said concerning the draft and
our national defense. H

We live today in a Nuclear Age. Any
major war which we are likely to get in-
volved in would be quick and violent.

Massive land arm-
ies which need much
time to mobilize would
obviously do no one any
good in such a war. Ev-
en if America armed
and mobilized every
one of its men, women, .
and children the Asian
hordes could still eas-
ily defeat us in any 3
“conventional” war.

AMERICA’S ONLY HOPE fo r survival
through much of its existence has been its
technological superiority over its enemies.
If our A-Subs, bombers, and ballistic mis-
siles far outclass the opposition then we
need fear no army.

Accepting this logic, I suggest that we
discontinue altogether the Selective Ser-
vice System.

From a Constitutional viewpoint it is il-
legal, as the Thirteenth Amendment dis-
permits involuntary servitude. The only
possible function our enormous land army
could have in this day and age is the con-
trol of the civilian population. "

All of our soldiers put together could
not stop one Soviet missile, but they could
quite effectively enforce a dictatorship,
especiallyif the general citizenry had
previously been deprived of its guns.

TO INCUR THE expense of supporting
4' large conventional force in the Atomic
Age is militarily suicidal. Our leaders
spend billions on maintaining a land army
while they know that this is not what Am-
erica needs for its defense.

The Federal Government gets very econ-

omy conscious whenever someone sug-

gests that we perfect an anti-missile sys-
tem or a nationwide bomb shelter com-
plex.

It has been speculated in high places
that the Russians have begun to construct
bomb shelters which could save a signifi-
cant part of their population. This may
put us by now at the wrong end of the
“Mine Shaft Gap.”

AT BEST THE DRAFT system is a trag-
ic waste of American talents. Our youth
should be allowed to move freely into sci-
ence and industry. Instead they are-forced

. to passup or delay. their schooling and are ‘

 

 

pressed into the armedforces for two or
more wasted years.

The suggestion that our boys in uniform
might someday be the tools of a Police
State, is not sheer lunacy on my part. When
you’re in the army, you TAKE ORDERS.
The federal troops who went into Arkan-
sas and Mississippi were following or-
ders.

The German soldiers at Aushwitz were
also obeying military command. We have
already witnessed in this country instan-
ces where US troops were ready to ‘gun
down their fellow citizens on orders from

the central authority. “But those were"

Southerners,” you might say, “and de-
served to be shot.”

IF OUR WASHINGTON Commissars

 can send their goons into Mississippi and
, ,  brutalize the people down there. they can
' f do the same thing anywhere else. The best

way to prevent a dictator’s coming to pow-
er is to deprive him of thething he needs
most, an army, ready to enslave the civil-
ians.

What about Vietnam? It is my opinion
that our military has a responsibility,
by all means, to protect AMERICA. We
have no moral obligation to be the Watch-
dog of the world. The policy of taking on
allies and signing treaties will inevitab-
ly involve us in war after war. ‘

If we had stuck fast to the advice of
George Washington, and “avoided foreign
entanglements” we would not today be
in’ Viet Nam. As long as we are there. we
should use our weapon superiority and
not the blood of our boys to drive the en-
emy to the peace table.

IF OUR LEADERS were really sincere
about eliminating Communism from Asia
or anywhere else, they would give air and
naval support to Chaing Kai Chek’s half
million troops. '

If our Navy would just let the anti-Com-
munist Chaing off Formosa, he could prob-
ably chase the wobbly Mao all the way
to Moscow. But. as our leaders have time
and again told us, victory is not our objec-
tive in Vietnam, or anywhere else.

The American Legion should aim before
it shoots. The Army is not what it used to

be. It has in the past 20 years fallen un-.

der the control of intellectuals. Politicians
and sociological theorists.

The President and his Secretary of No.
Offense, rigidly control the military from
the tax reachi_ngs. The Legionnaires are no
cation of PITT politics. This IS quite un-
derstandable, but they should keep in mind
that there is nothing Saint-like about an

army. Under the wrong man a large army

is_ a_, speedy vehicle. in to "the Garri_son_

clear majority of the students sampled
-dislike the color of the Tuck Shop walls.

A questionnaire was distributed to a
random sampling of 240 people on Jan.
29 at 12:00 in the Tuck Shop. These were
the findings‘: G

(1) 80.5% disliked thecolor of the Tuck!

Shop walls; 3.7% liked the color; 15.8%
were indifferent

(2) 36.6% spend 10 hours or more per
week in the Tuck Shop; 37.9% spend 5 to 10
hours per week

In response to the question “What col-
or would you say the walls of the Tuck
Shop are,”,I got answers such as “dirty
flesh” or “gar-beige.”

The Tuck Shop’s' color is disliked by
80.5% of the students sampled. Further,.
the Tuck Shop is located in the Cathedral
near the elevators and visitors to the Uni-
versity may unwittingly wander in and be-
come depressed. While there are many
other inadequacies that need changing
in the Tuck Shop (e.g., ventilation and
lighting). the -administration must begin
somewhere, and in view of the results of
the survey, the color cannot be ignored.

  Language ‘Revisited’ With Open Book 

Editor, The Pitt News,‘ ‘

I say that I am getting a little tired of
the constant barrage of student sentiment.
I consider myself to be possessed of most,
if not all. of the above mentioned_quali-
ties. And yet, despite and through all the
reams of fertile verbiage I have not heard
my thoughts expressed.

There I was, trying to relearnmy high-
school French so that,I can pass the im-
posed language requirement so that I can
be admitted to another imposed require-

.ment — the Master’s comprehensive ex-

ams ——.so that I can receive a graduate
degree in my field which will mean prac-
tically nothi_ng since the course offerings
in my department are not of sufficient
measure to prepare me to ‘do anything in
my field. when I picked up the Feb. 10, 1969
Pitt News hoping to find a bit of comic re-
lief. “

I was not disappointed. There on pages
4 and~5 was an empassioned article by
another poor child of the system who also
found it necessary to relieve himself mo-
mentarily from the oppression of a relat-
ed but lesser imposed requirement of
that system.

I should be forced to,go back on my orig.-'

Student Press, Yes,

In your letter to The Pitt News publislie
Jan. 23 you raise a very interesting.iss,uf,
concerning the ‘rights of employees toyrfe‘
fuse proposed tasks. I wonder whethej
the Administration would always supper
conscientious disobedience as wellpa’
you have supported Mr. Beers of Cent’
Printing. ' e  1'
However, your argument with Mr.._Ro‘
senblum neglects the time element. If-V
staff assumes Central Printing will pub
lish whatever copy they prepare, the
will write with a certain publication schéd
ule in mind. Then if "the copy is rejecte.
and they are asked to make another _prin_t
ing arrangement, they may have to‘.Iré
write. And in fact the opportunity to ex‘
press an idea at an appropriate time ma."
be entirely lost. -  -1:
Without some sort of detailed jguide
line from Central Printing, a sort of 7‘c;oii
tract, the students should, as a matte:
of caution, assume that they will indeed
have to seek outside printing. It is also no
clear to me that the University will alway‘
authorize paymentof thebill. I ‘ 

My own feeling is that both the Stu’
dents and the administration need auto __.
omy. Student publications should be finan,
ced by student funds controlled entirely
by students. and the students should. "be
free to take all their printing outside 'tli_e"
University if they want to. Or they could
have their own printer with either guaran-
teed access to Central Printing facilities or
his own print shop.  

Those who would demand that the -Uni

der our Constitution. It would'be'agsor_r‘-y

While I’m at it I’d like to raise anoth}
er question: do other employees of ‘Pitt

themselves, reserve University rooms
for meetings and work, make contracts
-with Central Printing, etc. which are pres’-.

that I had at last found a spokesman in‘
Mr. Tiernan. But, alas, it was not so._I:o_ok‘-'_

But the horrible thought that if I don’t
study my French so that I can pass the
required exam so that I can take my comps
and get out of this University and proceed 
to live underthe influences of my own in--*.

that it will not interfere with my super:

 Little Work, Many Benefits

Television broadcasting is intensely competitive
and allows little experimentation or development of
technique. One bad broadcast may drive a portion of
the audience to another station.

TV also spends more money promoting its news

' personnel than newspapers, for example. A station is
not willing to finance publicity for a reporter who

cannot “sell” himself or his news.

Both the number of reporters applying for news-
caster ‘jobs, and the quality of broadcasting de-
manded, combine to create what Miles continually
stressed as the “competitive nature” of the field.

Attempting to remain objective, Miles said he
“recommends nothing” in the way of broadcast-

ing schools. Stating that the choice of training was

the individual’s own decision, he mentioned only that
BA in journalism is desirable.

In response to the criticisms of students con-
cerning television broadcasting, Miles encouraged
the students to “get into the industry and change it.” '

From The Watchtower

*3

BY JOE ANDERSON
Staff Entertainment Editor

There is a strong dissatisfaction
filtering through many Rock
groups over what they feel is a
discrepancy between their “re-
corded” sound and their live
performances. This is easily un-
derstandable when one considers
the phony and artificial aspects
of the modern recording studio.

; Often a record is so over-dubbed

when it gets out of the studio.
that the musicians find it almost
impossible to perform it convinc-
ingly in concert. It is unfortunate
that some groups allow them-
selves to become the playthings
of some egotistical studio produc-
er. When such a relationship de-
velopes it is usually the death
knell of the group.

For some time now the Jeffer-
son Airplane have been trying to
get what they feel is an accurate
recording of one of their con-
certs. Their latest album is the
consummation of their past ef-
forts. Bless’ Its Pointed Little
Head (LSP-4133) is strange

‘vfor the singular fact that it IS

unlike any Jefferson Airplane
concert that I’ve ever attended. In
the two instances that I’d seen
them live, the Airplane were ob-
sessed with feedback and noise.
They couldn’t get together and
their vocals were all but in"-
audible. No such obstructions are
to be found on the new album.
In fact, Bless Its Pointed Little
Head is the live Jefferson Air-
plane that I had come to sus-
pect didn’t really exist. For once
they are together and in control
of their volume. and in most cases
the vocals are clear.

Instrumentally the group is al-
most flawless. Kaukonen’s guitar
rifts are precise and seldom in ex-
cess. A few of the songs are old
stuff done in new ways-“3-5 Of
A Mile,” “Somebody To Love,”
“It’s No Secret” and “Plastic Fan-
tastic Lover.” The best work
comes when the group gets into
the long pieces and everybody

Rock Groups Flip
ﬁl.n‘Technical’ Orgyﬁ

   

Cream’s recorded studio ses-
sions have all the characteristics
of some perverse technical orgy.
The only exception to this is their

first album which besides being,

their best is most notable for
being just the Cream as three
musicians and not twelve. Wheels
of Fire is the one album which
allows the listener to compare

the studio with the live. It is-

hard to imagine anyone perfor-
ming the studio record over that
of the live performance.

Goodbye has three live cuts
which are reworkings of previous-
ly recorded material. “I’m So

Glad” had, as can be expected,-

very good instrumentation but
falters terribly over the most ag-
onizing of vocals. The two re-
maining live pieces (“Politician”‘
and “Sitting On Top Of The
World”) are much better. touch-

ed with many of the trade-‘

marks of these three “super-musi-

_ cians.” The three studio cust are

typical syrupy, over-dubbed
Cream with only “bearable” song
being “Doning That Scrapyard
Thing.’ Maybe there are more

A live recordings of the now defunct

Cream floating around some
where. If so, it would be a good
thing if they could be collected
and placed on the market.

Other new waves in the turgid
Rock ocean are Jethro Tull —
This Was (RS-6336) and Led
Zephelin (SD-8216). Jethro Tull

. likes to call itself a jazz-rock group

in the Cream style which I guess
is all right but hardly necessary.
The group is composed of three
fine musicians with a strong

‘jazz orientation but not in any

way similar to the Cream. Led
Zeppelin is another strong group

with roots laid down in the blues-

Their style is sufficiently varied
so as not to limit them to just the
roots. Both Jethro Tull and Led
Zeppelin are worth getting in-

to.

Leltane As “The Old Jew”

by JOANN SLOMNICKI
Staff Feature Writer '

I left the Studio 011 Theatre
production of The Old Jew(as'
played by Gregory Lehanel with-
out my usual feeling of having
wasted time. Watching that per-
formance was an experience both
in growth and entertainment.

Although the plot itself can be
interpreted as profound, it was
Greg Lehane’s very sensitive por-
trayal of the savagely lonely and
guilt ridden old man that made
the‘ evening. His every gesture.
wheeze, ' and slobber was an
articulate replica of the physically
disheveled old Jew whose heart
is broken but ‘whose spirit isn’t.

Polaris

To Select
Editor

Applications are now being ac-
cpeted for the position of editor
and business manager of» Polaris.
Candidates can pick up applica-
tions in the Office of Student
Publications, 405 SU.

Polaris executive board will
meet at 2 p.m. Feb. 26 in 405
SU to interview candidates and
select the new editor" and bus-
iness manager.

All other publication selection
dates are as follows: Skyscraper
Engineer — March 3; Owl — March
11; Ideas and Figures — March
13; Pitt Capsule — March 18;
Noose — March 20.

Applications for editor and
‘business manager of all publica-
tions are available in 05 SU.
All meetings will take place at
2 p.m. in 405 SU unless other-
wise designated.

In other words. Lehane’s acting
conveyed a character who no long-
er entertained any. hope for his
own personal salvation, but who
still had enough courage to fin-
ally expose the selfish hypocrisy
of others.

And for those of us who in ad-
dition to good acting. _require a
play to carry “_a message” The
Old Jew has potential too. It
seems the author, Murray Schlis-
gal. is trying to stress the pre-
cariousness of reality. This is
supported by the fact that towards
the end of the play, the actor
straightens from his stoop, re-
moves his make-up, and answers
a call fromhis agent. Thus real-
ity suddenly changes from hav-
ing an actor playing an old man.
to having an actor playing an
actor playing a role.

In a prior event in the play the"
viewer also had to adjust to a re-
vision of reality while the author
was making an attack on mid-
dle class values and aspira-
tions. This was when the old Jew

made the switch from telling his
imaginary visitors what they be-
lieved and wanted to hear of

themselves to telling them what Q

he really thougt of them. The
old man abruptly reversed from
telling Mrs. Berger" how proud

she should be that her children  A

had achieved the status of a house

in the suburbs to informing her _

that she was a
knew when to say

pig who
“tit” and

when to say “tat” but didn’t know- .- ,-
enough to close her mouth long .~ 
enough to feel a heart breaking ‘

So if you want messages, -fine
acting, and the sense of pride
in watching another University-
student create something, you

know where to go this Friday or 7

Saturday night.

He will be working through the
LAC exclusively. Students requir-
ing the advice of an attorney
should first Contact the LAC
(305 SU, ext. 7328).

After being contacted by the
LAC, Levenson will _provide ad-
vice and any other possible as-
sistance. There will be no charge
for this service.

 ‘Concerned Students’ Meet
i  To Plan Innovative Action

to set a committee to look into

radical change of the present cur-
ricular structure. Schueler nom-

inated Dr. David Huston of the.

Economics Department to head
the committee and sought the
support of the approximately 100-
150 students who were present.

Dr. Huston expressed the sen-
timent that he.“would always be
open to ideas from students" and

encouraged those listening not to ,

hesitate contacting him at any
time.

In the area of University em-
ployment practices, several top-
ics were brought up to be con-
sidered for research and change.

evenson Accepts Post

If a trial in court is necessary.
the student may choose to retain
Levenson or to hire another law-
yer. This bill, however, must be
paid by the student.

Levenson expressed his hap-
piness with his appointment and
with the existence of such a,com-
mittee, noting that “there have
been many cases where students
have found themselves in real
trouble and had no lawyer avail-
able to advise them on what to
do."

He also promised to help the
committee and the students in any
way he can, stating that he ‘-‘likes
to ‘work with college students and
the type of problems they general-
ly have.”

Levenson anticipates most of
his work for the LAC and the stu-
dents will be in the areas of
criminal law, narcotics, and the
draft.

On this last subject, Levenson

suggested the possibility of pre-'

paring a pamphlet on the Selec-
tive Service System. This is
something which he finds both
confusing and very important to

Pitt Does It Again:
Spring Drills at Finals

nuuunnuuunuuunnuuuunuuuunuunuuununuuuuunuuuunnnuunnunuuuuunuunuununuuunu

Ever notice how Duke ‘University seems to creep into
local sports news every so often?

Usually it’s in terms of basketball recruitment of a
Dick DeVenzio or a Steve Litz. Lately,‘ it’s been more in
line with football recruits from the area (12 currently on
the Duke roster). But even more interesting is a press
release this sports staff received this weekfrom Duke.

Tomorrow — yes, tomorrow — Duke-foot-
ball begins its spring football practice.
Scheduled to run through March 15, the
Blue Devils’ spring drills are among the
earliest in the country.

  
 

in

All this news from Durham has to start
people around here thinking, too. Duke’s
taken three or four gridders from Western
Pennsylvaina alone, so far. Pitt has none._ ' .; 
Penn State and West Virginia aren’t sit-
ting on their hands either. Where will Roy Jacobs
our 18 or 20 come from?

There was a report earlier this term that fifty top
prospects questioned, none indicated Pitt among their first

and freshman teams against the tracksters from Penn state.

Banner’s athletes haven’t had "

too much difficulty (expecially
at home) this winter, but the
story may be a little different once
the field even-ts begin at noon
and the running competition starts
at1:00 p.m. »

“It’l1 be kind of hard tojpick a
winner,” assistant coach Gary
Meckley decided. “Of course,
we hope to win.” T

“They (Penn State) lost to
Navy ,— at Navy; but nobody beats
Navy at home,” he continued.
“And we’re in pretty ,good

shape as far as the individuals
go.”

Those varsity individuals will

‘ probably be glad to face the Nit-

tany Lions, too. They. have been
in some big invitationals late-
ly and have had to really prove
themselves. For the most part,
they did do this. '

Jerry .Richey has been improv-
ing steadily each week. Last
week he got_ to the point where
he helped in handing Sam

unusual for Richey tomorrow. He
will run the mile and then come
back to aid the two mile relay
team. There is a slight possibility
that he will enter the individual
two mile chase, too.

One of the varsity runners will

find himself in a somewhat differ-
ent situation against State. Smit-
ty Brown, who has run the 600-
yard race and has anchored the
mile relay team in machine-like
fashion, will assume those duties
once again. However, he is slated
to run-the 50-yard dash, a race he
has yet to try this winter.

There may be a little experi-
menting and shuffling in the re-
lay line-ups for the meet, but it’s
a safe bet that John Aiken, Carlos
Reisen, Rudy Hufnagle, Dick
Werner, and Mike Nolan will be
in the groups. somewhere. along
with Richey and Brown.

Duquesne Visits

  F rosh Revenge

by ED CONLEY

‘Page l0—THE PITT NEWS—Friday, February 14, 1969

Tim Grgurich’s Cubs get a second chance at their cross-

. town rivals, the highly successful Duquesne frosh, tonight. A

few weeks ago the Dukes downed the Cubs. 83-66. in the Arena; this
time the Cubs have the home—court advantage.

The Field House pairing will
start at 8 p.m. and Grgurich is
hoping that the only similarity

between the two contests will be.

his absence. The coach was in
New Orleans last time; this time
he will be in New York for the
varsity game against Army. Assis-

tant coach Jim Monroe. once

again, will take over the coach-
ing chores

“It should be different (refer-
ring to the home court advan-
tagel,” Grgurich mentioned. “We
did have them down and had a

played a good second half. It was
just one of those things.”

The Cubs had a 34-31 margin
at halftime in that first game, but
were caught by surprise in the
final stanza. The Dukes put on a
productive press that wasn’t re-
moved until the final buzzer.

“Well, we’ve been working,
with the varsity. When they use

            
  
  

- it we get some work against it.

We know what we have to do; we
should be ready,” the coach re-
marked. ‘

As for his team’s defense in the
upcoming match Grgurich does-
n’t expect to make any changes.

In an aspect of the game that is

V “very important to defense. re-
, bounding. the mentor doesn’t ex-
-pect too much difficulty against

the Dukes.

“According to what I heard we
out-rebounded them last time. We
can do it again," he reasoned.

The one major problem that

may be hard to solve is the fast
break that the Dukes enjoy em-

ploying. Their leading scorer, ,

Mickey Davis, tallied quite a few
points with that maneuver ‘in the
Arena encounter.

There is still a minor crisis in-'
volving one of Grgurich’s most

productive athletes. Kent Scott.

who has been out of the line-up
‘suffering from a wrist sprain.
may get into the game, but the
coach isn’t sure that Kent is ready.

"We won’t know until the
game.” Grgurich said. “He play-
ed a little against West Virginia
and his shooting was off. It is
kind of doubtful."

The status of Scott is important
to the Cubs because the Dukes
are not the easiest team to beat,
as their 10-1 record would indi-
cate. The only loss came on a trip
to Altoona, where the home court
proved too large an obstacle to
the Pittsburgher’s.

 

Cagers Drop In On Cadets,

by JERRY L. GRUEBEL

The cagers head for snow-bound New York tomorrow. but it’s ‘

not the 15-inch snowfall that threatens to bury them.

Army hosts the men of Ridl at West Point. an unfriendly court

for opposing roundballers. The Cadets put their 11-7 mark in front of a
partisan, Cadet-infested crowd. against the cager‘s dismal. 4-15. mark.

“They’re very strong inside.” explained Ridl. “They just muscle

the ball in the hoop.”

The three “big” men for Army are not much taller than the cager’s up-

front three, but they have more
weight and more strength. Senior
Dick Simmons moves his 6-6, 220
frame efficiently in the Cadet pivot.
The big man is flanked by juniors
Mike Gyovai (6-5, 217) and Doug
Clevenger (6-2, 205).

' "Clevenger is only listed as 6-2 "

 

Grimm Finish Caps Sweep
As Hoopsters Lose, 89-69;
 Suffer Fourth Setback ,

The hoopsters traveled to Morgantown Wednesday night

thinking 1954, but returned home feeling Grimm after a, 89-

69 defeat.

The last time the hoopsters beat WVU cage teams twice in one
season was during the 1953-54 campaign. Two weeks ago. with the help
of a remarkable 55 per cent shooting night, the men of Ridl upset the
Mountaineers at the Field House, 90-87. But it was a different story
in the return engagement at West Virginia.

With a little more than 17
minutes showing on the clock, the
cagers pulled to within 6 points
of the Mountaineers, trailing
only, 43-37. But Mountaineer
guard Wayne Grimm quickly put
the game out of reach.

Heading one of WVU’s fre-
quent fast-breaks, Grimm scored on
a lay-up and completed the three-
point play. Then, seconds later,
the Great Bridge, Virginia native
stole a Mike Caldwell dribble
and ran in for another lay-up.
The cagers were never closer than

11 points after that.

Grimm finished with 18 points,
but WVU’s high scorer was sopho-
more shooter Skip Kintz who pour-
ed in 31 points. Jerry Causer led
the cagers with a personal varsity
high of 20 points. A

commented Ridl as he looked at the
Cadet roster. "but I think he’s big-
ger than that. I saw him play
against Penn State. and he is
strong.”

Against Penn State. the Cadets
shot 65 per cent and beat the Lions
by ten points. The cagers dropped a
65-50 decision to PSU earlier in the
season.

“They don’t always shoot that
high,” said Ridl, “but they shoot
pretty well.”

The cagers problem will not be
Army‘s shooting. It’s that rugged.

~ powerhouse offense that the Ca-

dets throw at their opponents.

"They like to climb all over

Point they like to climb a little

tremely hard to beat at home. The
Cadet cheering section, familiar
court atmosphere, and the famili-
ar lighting back-drop, gives Army
a big edge. An edge, that Ford-
dam University coach Ed Conlin
estimates at 15 points.

Earlier in the season. the Ca-
dets upset Temple in overtime at
West‘ Point, 60-59. The Temple
Owls are one of the more power-
ful teams in the.East.

“They play a tough man to man
defense," explained Ridl. “and
that also helps them a lot.”

The strength of the Cadetmen-A’

will be just as difficult an obsta-
cle to overcome on offense, as the
cagers will face on defense.

“They‘ll probably bang him
around,” said Ridl. worried about
his 5-10 shooting guard Mike
Caldwell. “He might run into
problems."

What it comes down to is that
the ‘cagers might, be facing a
roundball "team that has the
strength of a football team. But
Ridl is hoping for that scarce
good-shooting game to overcome
the Cadets.

Swimmers End Layoff,

., Visit Tough Orangemen

The varsity swimming team returns to action tomorrow af-
ter a two week layoff. The tankmen travel to Syracuse to face

the Orange Swimmers.

In their last meet. the first away contest of the season, the mermen
were dumped by a tough Maryland squad, 72-41. This loss brought the

season’s record to 2’5.

Syracuse, a perennial power-
house in the pool, boasts a more
impressive record to date. Ac-
cording to varsity coach Bill Grant,
“They have won four meets so
far this year, including a clob-
bering of Penn State. Their only"
losses have been against Colgate
and Bucknell.”

The Orangemen were nipped by
Bucknell 59-54 last Saturday,
while the tankmen were smashed
by the Bisons 72-41, earlier in the
year.

However, Grant believes that
this year’s meet will be a lot
closer than last year’s when
the Orange. won 74-39. “Their
swimmers’ best times are compar-
able to our boys’ best marks,”
he remarked.

Grant believes that strategy
will play an important role in de-
termining the outcome of the
contest. “The victory will be
decided by whom we place in'cer-
tain events,” he said.

Because of the squad’s lack of
depth in the freestyle events,
Grant hopes to win the breast-

, stroke, butterfly, individual med-

ley, and perhaps the medley relay
against Syracuse.‘

Two events which Grant is
quite confident about are the one
and three meter dives. “I think
that Dave Wessel will be able
to cop both of them on Satur-
day. Also, Chuck Zientak is only
a shade behind the Syracuse man
in the three meter dive.”

Although the team has not com-
peted in two weeks, Grant Feels
that the rest was a great advantage
to the boys. “All of them have
really pressed hard during the
practices, and they all feel that
we possess a good chance of
winning, ” he said.

A strong finish to the season
would give the tankmen a .500
mark. Two rﬁore meets remain af-
ter this one, and victories in all
three would leave the mermen with
a5-5 record. -

Grant is optimistic about start-
ing the winning streak at Syra-
cuse. “If all the boys are up for
the meet, I think we’ll be able to
drop the Orangemen. ”

Slippery Rock Finishes Strong

by MIKE WALDHOLZ

“He’s out there all alone.
Just fighting himself; you
can actually see him fighting
himself.” Thus coach Warren
Neiger described the pressure
that each gymnast goes through
during his performance.

And fight the gymnasts did
Wednesday night up at Trees
Hall against Slippery Rock State
College. The team performed
well against the first team they’ve
faced since West Virginia that
they had a chance to defeat. But
in the end the story had the ‘same
ring as the others, as the gym-
nasts, were defeated 111.75 —
106.60.

Up until the "final two events
the gymnasts were able to tie or
keep extremely close to their op-
ponent. But Slippery Rock sur-
prised many with strong perfor-
mances in the parallel bars and the
horizontal bars by Perry Thorpe
and Dayne Baird.

Before the meet Phil Lilly,

stated that, “Slippery Rock is our
chance to.win and I think we’ll
pick up in -the last two events
where they’re supposed to be
weak.” Afterwards, though, an
anguished Lilly said, “I guess

they weren’t as bad as we thought.
I guess they weren’t as bad as us.”

There were some exciting and
bright spots for the crowd to en-
joy. The gymnasts were able to
come back from a six point deficit
in the beginning of the meet due

, to the loss of one score in floor

exercise. After the side horse the
gymnasts were losing by .05
points.

At halftime the gymnasts were
only trailing by .80 and it look-
ed as though they might pull it
out. After the long horse vault
only .1 seperated the teams, in
Slippery Rock’s favor. Then came
the last two events where Slip-

pery Rock beat out the gymnasts; ,
by three and two points to gain L I’ 1;

the winning margin.

Even with the loss the gymnasts: V

were able to capture three first
places; one by Lowell Meek,
one by Phil Lilly and one by
captain Dave Andrew. Meek re-

— ceived a score of 8.9 with a truly

graceful performance in the floor
exercise.

Meanwhile, injured Bernie
Jesiolowski has had an operation
on his left knee to remove carti-
lage. Bernie will be out for the rest
of the season and like the whole
team is a hopeful for next year.

ST. VINCENT’S PINS LOSS ON KEGLERS

The bowling team suffered its first major setback of the sea-
son last Saturday at St. Vincent College. The keglers lost every-
thing but the fourth game, and only won two of twelve possible
points.

Scoring was relatively low on both teams. Jim Bombulie led

the St. Vincent Attack with a 211 game and a 725 total for four

games. Anchorman Tom Smith had a 718 total to top the Pitt

bowlers.

Despite the loss,. the bowling team is still very much in the
race, with a 32-16 record. This weekend the team‘ will compete
in the ACU-I regional tournament in West Virginia. The next
league match is with Point Park next week.
