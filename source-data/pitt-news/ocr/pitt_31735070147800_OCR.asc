Members of Pitt’s Anscombe Society
have a lot of ways to explain their
beliefs about sexuality and absti-
nence. -

Group president Joseph Petrich
equates premarital sex with stop-
ping for a Big Mac before heading
home for Thanksgivingdinner. It
ruins your appetite.

The group’s members are doing
what many college students ﬁnd dif-

  
 
  
   

ﬁcult — putting temptation aside in
a predominantly hook—up focused
culture, opting instead to save them-
selves until marriage. .

The Anscombe Society is now
University-certiﬁed to operate on
campus and has initiatives in the
works tospread abstinence educa-
tion at Pitt. This comes after a con-
troversial protest the group initiated
at a PantherWELL Sexpo event in
Towers Lobby about a month ago
that brought attention from the 10-
cal media. '

The Anscombe Society said the

University stiﬂed its right to free
speech after its asked members to

leave the lobby and stop distributing .,

material, such as tissue—paper ﬂow-
ers, promoting chastity. The group
later retracted its claims after meet-
ings with University administrators,
who pledged to help the group
achieve Student Organization Re-
source Center-certiﬁed status. SORC
recognized groups are able to use
rooms on campus, can get Student
Government Board allocations, and
use campus facilities.

Shortly after, the University re-

 

leased a statement on the issue in
which Dean of Students Kathy Hum-
phrey said that University adminis-
tration and the society had agreed to
work together to get the group’s mes-
sage out. Following the controversy,
group Petrich said in an e—mail that
“dealings with the University have
been quite pleasan .”

Petrich said the Student Orga-
nization Resource Center helped
the group organize itself and that
Student Health was “cordial” in
meetings.

Petrich and members of the
group said‘ the‘ student response
was "mostly positive, but there are
some who outwardly disagree with
the group’s beliefs.

of sex before marriage is a personal
choice. Still, he said that he doesn’t

Actress speaks on mental health

Actress Brittany Snow speaks in the Assembly Room of the William P

Gretchen Andersen
' Staﬁ” Writer

Actress Brittany Snow wants to
help Pitt students learn that “Love
is Louder.” It’s the name of a national
campaign she helped start that ad-
vocates for mental health issues, as
well as it’s slogan.

With the help of Thejed Founda-
tion — a nonproﬁt organization that
serves to reduce the rate of suicide
on college campuses — Snow cre-
ated a national movement called
“Love is Louder.”

A coalition of Pitt groups brought
the actress to the William Pitt Union
Assembly Room last night for “An
Eveningwith Brittany Snow,” to raise
awareness about mental health is-
sues. Several hundred students
attended the sold—out, free-ticket
event, many of them using markers

to write “Love is Louder” on their
hands as they entered the Assembly
Room.

Sponsors included Pitt Program
Council, Active Minds, the Talk
About It committee and the Division
of Student Affairs. The organizers
said they brought Snow to Pitt be-
cause of the national scale of college
student suicides, and they acknowl-
edged that the Pitt community itself
has faced student suicides. There has
been at least one suicide a year on
campus for the last three years.

The lecture, which covered
Snow’s personal experiences with
bullying, information about her
movement’s message and which
included a Q—and—A session, marked
Snow’s ﬁrst visit to campus. She was
joined by Courtney Knowles, execu-
tive director of the Jed Foundation,
who also spoke about the “Love is

Louder” campaign.

By the end of the night, some stu-
dents were eager to hit the “like”
button on the “Love is Louder” Fa-
cebook page. Amy Molitoris, afresh-
man, was one of them.

Molitoris is a psychology major
who said she attended the event
because she is interested mental
health. Molitoris said Snow’s speech
was inspirational and that she plans
to tell her friends about the “Love is
Louder” campaign. .

“I think they [“Love is Louder”]
can make a difference if enough
people respond to them,” said
Molitoris. “But some people dismiss
these groups, and that becomes a
problem.”

Pitt’s mascot might
be declared extinct

, Amy Friedenberger
Senior. Staff Writer

Roc the Panther, Pitt’s. mascot,
might be one of the last eastern
cougars still in existence in_the
northeastern part" of the United

States. Unfortunately, he doesn’t V

count.

Although the eastern cougar is
known by many names — moun-
tain lion, puma, panther, cata-
mount and painter — ghost cat
might be more appropriate.

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service, a federal government
agency within the Department of
the Interior, declared the eastern
cougar extinct earlier this month
and recommended that it be re-
moved from the nation’s list of
endangered species, where it has
resided since 1973.

It’s been more than a century
since Pitt adopted the panther as
its mascot. Students‘ and alumni
chose the panther in the fall of
1909, according to Pitt’s web-
site.

The panther was selected
because it was a “fearsome ani-
mal and indigenous to the area,”
historically considered a noble
animal, happened to create allit-
eration and is naturally gold in
color and would therefore match
Pitt’s color theme. Additionally,
no other college had a panther as
a mascot at the time. ’ «

The wildlife service conducted
a review of 573 responses to a re-
quest for scientiﬁc information
about the possible existence of the
eastern cougar. After requesting

- U.S. agency removes species from endangered list

information from 21 states that
are within the historical range of
the subspecies, the agency found
that none reported the existence
of an eastern cougar population.

The agency is now in the pro-

cess of preparing a proposal for

the removal of the eastern cougar
from the endangered species list.
If it does, then the animalwould
no longer be eligible for protec-

tion under the Endangered Spe— 7

cies Act. The decision would also
prevent the wildlife service from
reintroducing the cougar to the
east.

But before the agency makes
a ﬁnal decision, it will open the
proposal to the public and allow
it to contribute information — all
in accordance with the act.

Initially, cougars were hunted .

by early European settlers. Ac-
cording to the agency, states put
bounties on the cougar because
they threatened livestock. Over
time, deforestation, hunting and
the declined population of the
white-tailed deer -—~ the cougar’s
main prey — resulted in adecline
of the cougar population.

‘Mark Mccollough, the agen-
cy’s lead scientist for the eastern
cougar, said that events called
“circle hunts” in Pennsylvania
also contributed to the declining
population. He said that hunters
would gather in a circle and close
in on cougars to kill them. Some
men hunted cougarsas a full—time
job.

The last conﬁrmed eastern
cougar was trapped in the ’30s,
but the agency added the species

and asked them to come to Pitt. Active Minds
at the University of Pittsburgh is a student
organization that promotes mental health
awareness and education.

The “Love is Louder” campaign also be-
gan in the fall, after a string of high—proﬁle
suicides reported in the national media drew
increased attention to teen suicides and the
impact of bullying. According to the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention website,

suicide is the third leading cause of death for
people aged 15 to 24.

Snow, who said she “took the issue to
heart,” went to Knowles about what they
could do. The pair started working together
about ﬁve years ago. After some brainstorm-
ing, “Love is Louder” was born, and soon the
movement became a top—trending subject on
Twitter. K

Many students said they did not know what
to expect of the event or hadn’t heard of the
“Love is Louder” movement, but were drawn
to Snow because of her acting career.

Snow said to the crowd that she had per-
sonal experiences with bullying that were
“similar to others’.’.’ A

An unnamed girl bullied her when she was
younger, hitting her, throwing things at her
and writing nasty notes about her. Around

the same time, Snow said one of her friends

Snow said she had a hard time getting over
the bullying and tried to get her mind off it
by throwing herself into acting, using it as
therapy. She experienced feelings that she
“wasn’t good enough,” developing a critical

Storm doesn’t slow students down on spring’-s first day

Keith Gillogly
Senior Staff Writer

Around Oakland, the playful tune
of an ice cream truck coupled
with sunshine, warm tempera-
tures and the sight of stud_ents in
flip—flops and shorts marked the
first official day of spring.

The streets hummed with ac-
tivity throughout the morning
and afternoon, but — in typical
Pittsburgh fashion —-— the skies
later grew overcast and more
than a sprinkle of rain began to

the rain stopped after about 15
minutes. ‘
Students caught without um-

University to have abstinence programsbystudents

education if the University offered it.

There are currently 74 members on the
group’s Facebook page, but Petrich said only
about 10 regularly come to meetings, the same
number required for SORC certiﬁcation. The
group meets every other Thursday at 9 p.m.
in the Cathedral Commons.

Although some members in the society have
religious reasons for abstaining, the group is
secular — meaning it embraces members re-
gardless of their faith, or lack thereof.

And not all of them are virgins, a number
of members said.

Member Michael Israel said the society

 

does not ask members about the past.

“Having taken part in hooking—up through-
out the first few years of high school, I found
it quite difﬁcult to overcome,” Israel said in an
e-mail. “So much of the way I valued myself at
the time was based upon how many attractive
girls I could hook-up with.”

He said that now that he is chaste, he has
a more honest relationship with himself, God
and a potential spouse.

“Before that I just had no understanding
of the difference between love and lust,” Is-
rael said. ~

Member Stephanie Spinelli said in a Face-

book message that, “Saving yourself is what
picks out the guys — or even girls, for that
matter — who want to date you for who you
are rather than who just want to have sex with
you. It’s looked poorly upon by a lot of people,
but the ones who are really worth it aren’t
going to care.” ' A

The number of young adults choosing to
put off sex has increased, according the Cen-
ters for Disease Control and Prevention.

In a March 2011 National Health Statistics
Report, the number of people of ages 15 to 24
who reported no prior sexual contact with
another person jumped from 22 percent in

to the list when it was made in the ‘70s.
Although the eastern cougar remained on
the endangered species list, McCollough
said that it has most likely been extinct
since that last conﬁrmed cougar.

~‘~‘—Thére were some status reviews in the
1970s before the Endangered Species Act
was created,” McCollough said. But some
research at the time suggested that cougars
still existed in the eastern part of North
America. “Some books and research talk

about cougars existing in the 1960s and

19705.” I

The agency hears reports from people
who claim to have seen’ cougars in the
Northeast, but they are often deemed
misidentiﬁcations or sighting of cougars
from another region that people might have
illegally bought as pets and then released.

“We ‘recognize that many people have
seen cougars in the wild within the histori-
cal range of the eastern cougar,” said the
service’s Northeast Region Chief of Endan-
gered Species Martin Miller. “However, we
believe those cougars are not the eastern
cougar subspecies that had migrated east-
ward to the Midwest.” I

Size matters.
Clothing size that is.
Many women use clothing size

to measure selfworth. Unfortu—-

nately, the number on the tag is
largely inconsistent —— and not
just from store to store.

As our society has been grow-
ing, so have our clothes. But the
numbers stay the same. In the
1950s, a dress with the measure-
ments 30-22-32 was considered a
size 8. As early as the 2000s, the
same measurements are found
in a size 00, according to April

from the 1980s and before. Soon

.enough, we might even see a size

negative 2 grace clothing store
racks.
This phenomenon is called

’ vanity sizing, when clothing

companies add extra’ fabric to
pieces while keeping the size the
same, according to an article in
Cosmopolitan.

“There’s a self-esteem effect
of getting into a size 4 or a size
2, and clothing companies know
that,” said Cait Lamberton, an as-
sistant professor of business ad-
ministration at Pitt. “Particularly
in wedding dresses, the sizes are
actually smaller because women
want to say, ‘I wore this size dress
on my wedding day.”’

One of the major problems
with vanity sizing is the reason
why companies feel the need to
do it — our waistlines are ‘con-
tinuously expanding. In 2007-08,
68 percent of the U.S. popula-
tion was considered overweight
or obese, according to thejournal
of the American Medical Asso-
ciation. Comparatively, between
1950 and 1960, 33 percent of U.S.
adults were overweight and 9.7
percent were obese, according
to the Livestrong campaign’s
website . I

Once again, we see a need for
our country to combat its obe-
sity problem. By shrinking our
waistlines, we could eliminate

the need for clothing companies I

to practice vanity sizing.

Another problem with van-
ity sizing, of course, is that the
clothing manufacturers deceive
consumers by not following
standards for sizes. In a study
by Tammy Kinley, an associate
professor at the University of
North Texas, noted by Cosmo-
politan researchers measured
1,000 pairs of women’s pants and
found as much as an 8 1/2-inch
variation in the size 4 waist.

“The problem with it issit con-
fuses us. It takes longer to ﬁnd
the right size,” Lamberton said.
“Once you know you’re a certain
size in a certain brand, you’re go-
ing to keep going there.”

Because many women are sen-
sitive about their size, manufac-
turers should be required to fol-
low a standard. After all, wearing
a size 6 in one brand and then
having to buy a size 8 in another
can be upsetting.

“People get an inaccyrate per-
ception of their body and con-
fusing messages about the way
they’re built,” ‘Lamberton said.
“The downside is for the con-
sumers.”

Finally, we wish women didn’t
measure self-worth by the size
of their clothes. According to
the National Eating Disorders
Association, psychological fac-
tors such as low self-esteem and
feelings of inadequacy or lack of
control in life can contribute to
eating disorders. And because
not being able to consistently buy

and wear the same clothing size *“

can have psychological impacts,
it seems that vanity sizing could
very well be a contributing factor
to the 10 million women in the
United States currently strug-
gling with an eating disorder.

Because changing a culture’s
eating habits and self-esteem
principles is difficult, we stress
the importance of ending vanity
sizing by requiring manufactur-
ers to adhere to standard sizes
by implementing a sizing system
more like the one used in men’s
clothing that uses actual mea-
surements by inches instead of
arbitrary numbers. I

Impacts of NPR defund

Molly Green
Columnist

 

The House’s recently passed bill
to defund National Public Radio
is nothinglbut a political distrac-
tion.

The organization has a high-
proﬁle name — NPR — but deals
with a low—impact budget — NPR
received only $5 million in direct
government funding for the 2010
ﬁscal year, according to the New
York Post.

The bill introduced by’ Rep.
Doug Lamborn, R-Colo., however,
would also prohibit public radio
stations from purchasing program-
ming from NPR using government
grants. According. to the Post, un-
der current law, about 26 percent
of government grants must be used
for national programming — ac-
counting for an additional $56 mil-
lion in revenue for NPR. ,

Thus, this bill is marketing itself
as just another cut in a long line of '
reductions to save our economy, _'
last seen ﬂopping and ﬂailing like

a dried—out ﬁsh desperate to return‘

to water. .

But in truth, this bill would have
very little economic impact for the
government. $5 million is nothing.
The war in Afghanistan costs the
United States almost $300 million
in a single day, according to the AFP
wire service. I _

That’s not to say it won’t have
an impact on NPR, however. The
government would continue to fund
public radio stations, but would no
longer require those stations to use
a percent of those funds toward na-
tional programming, which could
cost NPR many more millions.

' And so thisgbill is not economic
in nature at all. It’s political.

There seems to be a conception
among some Americans that NPR
is left-leaning. Indeed, this would
be supported by Thursday’s vote on
the deﬁmding of the bill.

According to The New York
Times, the vote passed 228 to 192,
with all Democrats present andjust
seven Republicans voting against
it.

As a lifelong listener of NPR, I

would argue that it’s one of the most

objective suppliers of news in the I;
U.S. media. And I’ve heard as many . »
- liberalscdmplain that NPR is too

conservative as I’ve heard conserva-
tives complain that it’s too liberal.

But according to Newsweek,
an NPR survey last year found that
“37 percent of listeners described

. themselves as liberal or very liberal,

25 percent as middle of theroad
and 28 percent as conservative or
very conservative.”

The article then goeson to sug-
gest: “So this bill would strip away
$22 million from NPR to balance the
budget? How about cutting the $20
million the national guard pays to
sponsor just Dale EarnhardtJr.?”

I Clear1y'it’s not about the money.
And as Democratic Massachusetts
representative and all—around bad-
ass ‘Jim M_cGovern says, if that’s
the case, then, “we should be fair
and balanced in the way we do it,”
and take funding away from Fox
News as well. McGovern said Fox
“continued to employ several pro-
spective Republican candidates”

giving them “hours and hours of
free airtime.”

Unlike Fox and other televised‘
programming like CNN and MSN—
BC, NPR is valuable not only in its
push for objectivity (no ‘longer a

standard of any cable news net—'

work) but also in its variation of

perspectives and stories that are *

often ignored or truncated by news-
papers and certainly television.

_ According to “Talk of the Na-
tion’? host N_eal"Conan,, “We’ve
talked before in the show about
how  30 percent of the time on
NPR is about foreign affairs, ver-
sus 3 percent in commercial radio
-news.”

And its variety of shows such as
“Car Talk,” “This American Life,”
“Prairie Home Companion” and
“Western Swing,” among others,
offers insightful and often poignant
perspectives into facets of Ameri-
can life that might otherwise be
overlooked.

So back to the ‘question at hand:
If cutting NPR won’t balance the
budget and the organization enjoys
an audience of millions of partisan
viewers —— many through the rural
radio stations that depend‘on fed-
eral grants to broadcast it — then
why the staunch, near-unanimous
effort by Republicans to cut it?

Perhaps most importantly is
that everyone knows the bill will
never make it through the Senate —
making it a symbolic bill at best and
a time-wasting bill at worst.

A political distraction.-

“A Painter’s Legacy: The
Students of Samuel Rosen-
berg” _

Now through April 30
Curated by Melissa Hiller

Fine Perlow Weis Gallery»

and Berger Gallery
Tickets free to the public

Most critics believe art endures
long past its creator’s death.
The American Jewish Museum
of thejewish Community Center
of Greater Pittsburgh, however,
isn’t interested in simply sustain-
ing an artist’s work, but rather
—— at least in the case of Samuel
Rosenberg — sustaining the
memory of the artist himself.
Rosenberg was an artist who
taught at Carnegie Mellon for
about 50 years and instructed

Andy Warhol. His‘death in 1972
has not tempered the reverence
he attracted from his followers.

Melissa Hiller, the exhibition’s
curator, spent almost two years
contacting former students of
Rosenberg in an attempt to piece
together an exhibition honor-

ing his contributions to the art

world. .
“He was a direct influence
on four generations of [art] stu-
dents,” Hiller said, noting that
the professor’s influence mani-
fested itself in a variety of ways.
“Part of what was important
to Rosenberg was that a good
teacher doesn’t create a certain
recognizable school of art. There
isn°t any ‘Rosenbergian’ style. If
there were, he would feel like he
didn’t do his job.” v
Many of the students that
Rosenberg taught went on to have
spirited art careers in remarkably
disparate genres. Jane Haskell,

for example, an artist featured
in the show and a Pitt graduate,
said that Rosenberg “freed me to
do what I do.” Today she creates
installation pieces and “lots of oil
paintings.” Conversely, featured
artist and former Rosenberg stu-
dent George Nama works mostly
in etchings. _ _

Nama, who -has served as a Pitt
professor, said Rosenberg didn’t
directly inﬂuence his art in a way
that would be apparent to an ob-
server, but instead impactedhim
in other ways.

“At the time, he taught ev-
eryone to be serious ..-. It was a

serious endeavor to be an artist,” '

he said.

By Hiller’s estimation, Rosen-
berg taught a number of students
that’s “in the high hundreds”

over the course of his 50-year ,

career.
“What is difficult to say with

words is that what made him so .

special to his students didn’t have
so much to do with the number
of students he taught but with
the number of students that were
such devoted students of Rosen-
berg,” Hiller said. -

Hiller said all of the people
Rosenberg taught who later be-
came artists “claimed his very
essence as a major inﬂuence on
their lives.” _

_ Indeed, the work of Rosen-
berg’s protegés underscores the
durability of his teachings. Andy
Warhol, for example, is now a
20th-century icon, revered as a
pop-culture visionary. Many oth-
ers experimented in post-World
War II abstract expressionism
—— a nihilistic, anarchistic and
rebellious genre.

Haskell and Nama added that
Rosenberg not only helped de-
velop their artistic abilities on
an individual level but also had
a singularly engaging class pres-

ence. Nama remembered that

Rosenberg always came in a suit ‘

and tie and was “very genteel and
serious.” - .
Haskell said that Rosenberg
“proposed many experiments in
class that taught me a great deal
about painting.” He cited an ex-
ercise in which students would
paint in all light colors or all dark
colors. “He was a very philosoph-
icalman, and we had many great
discussions in, class.”
Rosenberg retired in 1963,
so his still-living students are
well into their 70s and 80s. The
Americanjewish Museum, Hiller
said, has wanted to create an ex-
hibition like this form years.
On the surface, the exhibit is
a collection of works by students
who all studied under_the same
teacher. ‘But according to Hiller, it
can also serve as a demonstration
of the effect a teacher can have on
generations’ of students.

FOOD COLUMN

Girl Scout cookies, de-mystified  

Sarah Simkin
Column

If you’re like most people, Girl Scout cook-
ies are a commonplace, albeit delicious,
aspect of everyday life. However, if you’re
a food columnist and/or someone con-
cerned with random trivia — I, myself,
am both — there‘ is something deeply
perplexing about them. Speciﬁcally, they
seem to have multiple personality dis-
order.

_ Girl Scout cookies have different names
depending on where you purchase them,
with no immediately discernible geo-
graphical pattern: one troop sells Caramel
deLites, while the troop across town might
be selling Samoas. The explanation for
this, although disappointingly un-sinister
and not involving any secret, age—old Girl
Scout rivalry, is a bitcomplex.

Since 1917, the Girl Scouts of the USA
have raised funds" for their organization
with cookie sales, originally baked by the
girls themselves but later by professional
bakeries, according to the organization’s
official website. Today there are two sepa-
rate Girl Scout Cookie distributors, Little

Brownie Bakers and ABC Bakers, each
using a different recipe to produce ex-
tremely similar cookies.

Every Girl Scout regional council de-
cides which licensed baking company to
use for cookie sales within its geographi-

cal area, as well as which cookie varieties '

it will make available from said baking
company. .

The Girl Scouts of the USA requires
that three varieties be sold everywhere:

Peanut Butter Sandwiches or Do-Si—DosV

— respectively from Little Brownie Bakers
and ABC Bakers — Shortbreads or Tre-
foils and the ubiquitous Thin Mints, which
go ‘by no other name and is estimated to
account for as much as 25 percent of to-

V tal cookie sales. Although some beloved

favorites like Caramel deLites/Samoas
and Peanut Butter Patties/Tagalongs are
almost always available, the rest are at
the mercy of the council.

For now, let’s focus on the obvious issue

. at hand: Which brand is better? A chance

confluence of key elements allowed for a
fair comparison: a box of cookies I pur-
chased from a local troop selling ABC

‘You are Here’ explores the interplay of architecture, people

Jeff Ihaza
Staff Writer

“You are Here: Architecture and Experi-
ence”

Nowthrough May 29 .

Carnegie Museum of Art '

Free for Pitt Students

The sight of two Russian “ﬁght clubs”
brawling outside of a housing project in
St. Petersburg, Russia, might seem most ap-
propriate for a Soviet-era spy ﬁlm. Instead,
it’s part of Berlin-based artist Cyprien Gail-
lard’s video “Desniansky'Raion,” currently
on display as part of the “You Are Here:
Architecture and Experience” exhibit at the
Heinz Architectural Center in the Carnegie
Museum of Art. _

The exhibit explores the power man-
made structures have on human existence
— as both exemplars of human ingenuity
and also instigators of social decay. The two
artists whose works are displayed, Gail-
lard and Candida Hiifer, attempt to illus-
trate this inﬂuence in remarkably different
fashions: Gaillard probes modern housing
blocks and their social impact, whereas
Hiifer explores classical architecture with

detailed photography.

Gaillard was born in Paris in 1980 and
currently lives in Berlin. He explores con-
temporary landscapes and architecture
through a variety of media, including video,
painting and etchings. Much of his work
deals with the legacy of buildings and land-
scapes that are left in ruins and the ways in
which we interact with them. .

The centerpiece of Gaillard’s portion
of the exhibit is the 30-minute video
“Desniansky Raion,” in which housing
projects are seen from several different
perspectives: ﬁrst,.through gang-ﬁghting;
second, through the demolition of a hous-
ing tower and the light show that precedes

' it; and third, through a_ panning shot of

the innumerable housing blocks in Kiev,
Ukraine. I ,
Gaillard said that he ﬁlmed in Belgrade,
Serbia; St. Petersburg, Paris and Ukraine,
and that the video was named after one
of the housing sites featured in the piece.
He described the video as a depiction of
modern housing blocks and their status
as places of gang-ﬁghting, entertainment
and grandeur — each quality in turn cor-
responding to the three segments. Gaillard
said the process of collecting footage was
hands-off: In order to capture the essential

madness ‘of the housing blocks, he never
interfered with any of the images that ap-
pear in his video.

“I wanted to show the chaos of our struc-
tures, like how the rubble that is created
after a demolition is recycled into the con-
crete for more structures,” Gaillard said.

Tracy Myers, the show’s curator, said
this exhibit differs from other events the
Carnegie Museum has held in the Heinz
Architectural Center.

“There isn’t a single architectural draw-
ing in the entire show. There’s a far more
personal feel to this kind of representa-
tion,” Myers said. 7

The other half of the exhibit features
photographs taken by Germany-based art-
ist Hﬁfer. Hiifer was born in Eberswalde,
Germany, in 1944, studied with Bernd
Becher and is identiﬁed with a group of
German artists best known for their im-
mensely detailedphotographs of architec-
ture, landscapes and urban developments.
H6fer’s focus is on depictions of architec-
tural interiors. I

The massive photographs featured in
“You Are Here” depict classic elements
of high culture "ranging from theaters to
museums. In “Ballettzentrum Hamburg
III,” the inside of a German ballet is de-

.....
picted in grandiose detail. Similarly, the ‘
massive 6-foot “Musee du Louvre Paris
XX” potrays sculptures from the Renais-
sance, like Michelangelo’s “David,” with
insightful nuance. .

Myers also said that although these pho-
.tographs are of architectural interiors, they‘
aren’t simply architectural photographs.

“Architectural photographers create im-
ages of what they" want -— or the architect
wants — you to understand about a build-
ing,” Myers said. “This is sort of dead—on.
She has enough distance philosophically
to allow the image, the place, to speak for
itself.” V p

Contextualizing the program are two
discussions: one between Myers and Gail-
lard that took -place on March 4, and an;
other scheduled for April 21 titled,‘ “Culture '
Club: Experiencing Architecture through
Film and Photography,” which Myers will
lead. Assistant director of communications
Ellen James, who helped organize the dis-
cussions, said that the conversations were
designed to give new insight into the art.

“[The events] are unique in that they
allow for a discussion about the art as op-
posed to just coming and seeing an exhibit,”
James said.

Battle of the peanut butter Wafer

Simkiln scrutinizes two contenders for top cookie

Cookies 4 11

Baker Varieties, a box of cookies mailed to
my roommate from a Little Brownie Bak-
ers council region and several midterm
papers that no one wanted to write. The
Peanut Butter Pattie vs. Tagalong chal-
lenge was on. '
The differences begin before one even
opens the boxes. Despite featuring the
same photograph of smiling girls appear-
ing to exercise teamwork skills through
basketball or some other Girl Scout—y
activity, the packaging reveals different
nutritional contents: A single serving of

Little Brownie Tagalong cookies is 140 P

calories, whereas the ABC Peanut Butter
Pattie serving contains a mere 130.

One might be inclined to assign addi-
tional merit — brownie points, if'you’ll
pardon the pun — to the cookie variety
with the no—nonsense, contents-explain-
ing name as opposed to the specimen with
the camp-song epithet that gives no indi-
cation as to what manner of baked good

» it is.

A side—by—side comparison of the cook-
ies themselves will reveal that, although
roughly identical in size, Peanut Butter
Patties have a clearly paler milk—choc0late
hue, while the chocolate coating of the
Tagalongs is darker in color. No real fa-

vorite as of yet, unless the calorie count
is a deal—breaker for you —— really, it’s the

cross—section analysis where the differ- r

ences become pronounced.

The Peanut Butter Pattie’s luxuriously
thick chocolate coating hides a dense in-
terior vanilla cookie featuring barely a
divot of an ‘indentation to house the all-
important peanut butter,_which is itself
of a dry, crumbly nature. The Taga1ong’s
vanilla cookie base is light and crispy
with a deeper cavity ﬁlled with a gener-
ous helping of creamy peanut butter--

which one might speculate accounts for
the increased caloric content.

In a scientiﬁcally rigorous blind taste ’

test, “judges” claimed to be able to dis-
tinguish a taste difference and expounded
upon the virtues of the various consis-
tencies and chocolate-to—peanut butter
ratios. In a less formal grabbing—a—cookie—
from—whichever-box—was-closer experi-
ment conducted later, there was no clear
winner. ,- -

For what it’s worth, my own personal
loyalty remains with the Peanut Butter

Patties — the cookies I sold for. years .

in support of Bluebell Troop 1212, often
door—to-door from a sled during a blizzard
for maximum sympathy sales. ‘

ALBUM REVIEW

Ocean’s ‘Nostalgia’ downtroddentheartfelt

Jeff Ihaza
Staﬁ” Writer

Nostalgia, Ultra
Frank Ocean
Self-released

. Rocks like: Drake with more “swag”

A

Frank Ocean is no stranger to love songs -— in
fact, the New Orleans-born singer is credited
with writing romantic numbers for the likes
ofjohn Legend and evenjustin Bieber. But un-
like Bieber, Ocean doesn’t exactly hail from a
family-friendly musical background.

Ocean, whose real name is Christopher
“Lonny” Breaux, is the R&B component of the
hip—hop collective Odd Future Wolf Gang Kill
Them All (OFWGKTA), a group of teenage skat-
ers with a reputation for unrelentingly raw lyr-

ics. Ocean’s markedly cleaner songs are in many '

ways motivated by the same sentiments, but
from a completely different perspective.

The opening interlude, employing a ’90s
nostalgia that permeates the album, is named af-
ter the classic video game “Street Fighter.” More
somberly, the ﬁrst ﬁ1ll-length track, “Strawberry
Swing,” features Ocean delivering an apocalyp-
tic story of atomic bombs and a dying earth with

the simple refrain, “I’ve loved the good times '

here / and I will miss our good times here.” The
song ends with what sounds like analarm clock
waking Ocean from a perceived dream.

The singer delivers trademark smooth-
ness throughout the album. On “Novacane,”
he croons about smoking weed with a porn
star at Coachella, and on “Songs 4 Women,” he
unabashedly admits to using his singing ability
to get girls, while at the same time lamenting a
woman who ignores his music for more conven-
tional 'R&B singers like Drake or Trey Songz.

The most candid moment on the album sur-
faces in “There Will Be Tears,” in which Ocean
tells of his nonexistent relationship with his
father. In addition to being incredibly heartfelt,
the songhighlights acommon threadbetween
Ocean and the boys of Odd Fuuire: absent dads.

his song “Couch,” “But something was always

4I_\RENA FOOTBALL

New arena team provides alternative football style

Nate Barnes
Staﬂ" Writer

With the NFL lockout now in
full effect, the city of Pitts-
burgh needs a new team for its
football ﬁx. Almost on cue, the
Pittsburgh Power has come to
town hoping to appease football
fan’s appetites.

Ad campaigns featuring the

M ‘Slogan “Half the Field, Twice

the Excitement” have not failed
to excite fans of the new Arena
Football League franchise. The
Power play at the recently erect-
ed Consol Energy Center, which
also serves as the home address
of the Pittsburgh Penguins.

The team features players who

did not manage to realize their
NFL dreams out of college and
have turned to the AFL to con-
tinue their hopes of a football
career.

The ﬁrst game of the season
against the Philadelphia-Soul
earlier this month began with
much fanfare before the team
lost in overtime. The public ad-
dress announcer, Bubba Snider,
provided entertaining and bois—'
terous commentary before and
during the game’s festivities.

Before the game, major-
ity co—owner of the team, Lynn
Swann walked onto the field
and expressed his gratitude to
Pittsburgh fans for their support
of this new team. Swann then
touched on his excitement for

this new era in Pittsburgh Arena
Football and thanked those in
attendance once again.

“Support is the foundation
of a long—term successful fran-
chise,” Swann said after the
game. “We are grateful for the
support and look forward to
more great football in front ‘of
our great fans.”

The Power roster is com-
prised of former NFL players
who dropped out of the league,
like former Chicago Bears and
Minnesota Vikings kicker Paul
Edinger, as well as accomplished
college players looking to re-
build their careers. The team is
also highlighted by a few Pitts-
burgh natives.

Cornerback Josh Lay is from

Aliquippa High School and
starred at Pitt from 2002-05,
and backup quarterback Kevin
McCabe went to Pine-Richland
High School before playing at
California University of Penn-
sylvania.

Local products Mike Wash-
ington (Aliquippa), Josh Rue
(Gateway) and Gary Butler (Cali-
fornia, Pa.) also started the sea-
son on the team’s active roster.

As the game began, Bubba
Snider described the rules of
AFL games and continued to
do so throughout the contest.
This was especially important,
as most in attendance were ab-
solutely clueless as to what was
going on.

Rules in the AFL are markedly

different than those of the NFL.
Games are played on a 50-yard
field of artiﬁcial turf, with field
goals that are taller and more
slender than the neon posts in
the NFL. Attached to the goal
posts are two large squares of
net, which allow kickoffs as well
as missed ﬁeld goals to be played
as they bounce off the net, add-
ing another element of excite-
ment to the game.

The boundaries of the field
are marked by the walls encir-
cling it. If a player who has the
football is pushed into the wall,
the play is dead and the team's
line up for the next play. Also,

the ball can be played off the

off the wall, it can be caught and
kept in play.

“They provide a great alter-

skill,” Pitt -freshman Pat McA-

The ball is _not dead until it
hits the ground, but even when
this happens, the clock contin-
ues to run. The walls also can
be an exciting element of the
game, a factor showcased in
multiple instances during the
first game..

Power receiver Washington
(dubbed the “Human Joystick”
by Snider for his speed and agil-
ity) caught the ball on a quick
out pattern and was then thrown
over the wall by a member of
the Soul. The play resulted in an
unnecessary roughness penalty
and put the Power in better po-
sition to score, which they did
onvthe next play by means of a
touchdown pass from quarter-

Arena football provides excitement

‘("-
ing things I have ever seen,” Pitt
freshman Matthew Gretz said
after the game.

To that end, the Power ac-
complished its goal and satisﬁed
at least one fan. The entertain».
ment factor of the AFL is based
on excitement, fast—paced play
and big plays on both offense
and defense. ’

That is what the AFL is all
about.

The Power played most re-
cently on Saturday against the
Iowa Barnstormers, earning the
first victory in franchise history
by a 30-point blowout, 58-28, in
front ofa crowd of 9,190 to even
their record. at 1-1. Fortunately»
for this city, the Power gave us
all a little sunshine in an oth-
erwise very dark weekend for
local sports.

The next home game comes
on Saturday, April 2, when the

Power will take on the Tulsa '

FOOTBALL g
Coach brings new defensive style

New Pitt co—defensive coordinator Keith Patterson will look to improve the Panthers,

Alex Oltmanns
Sports Editor

A new era of Pitt football —— the Todd
Graham era — has begun, and Keith
Patterson will serve as the former Tulsa
coach’s secretary of defense.

After a disappointing performance

last season, and especially from the de—A

fense in the Backyard Brawl, Pitt fans
widely called for a change.‘ And the re-
cent overhaul of the coaching staff will

bring just that —— a drastically different
playing style. ‘

Named as Pitt’s co—defensive coordi-
nator and linebackers coach injanuary,
Patterson is one of the coaches redeﬁning
that style of play. The former four—year
letterman at cornerback for East Central
Univeristy in Oklahoma seems more than
eager to start bolstering the Panthers’
defensive corps.

ways going to force the issue,” he said.
“It’s a fun style because it’s an attacking
style of defense. We’re going to dictate
the p.lay to the offense.” * — .

Working in the same role under Gra-
ham the past eight seasons at Tulsa, Pat-
terson’s defenses were some of the best
in the country and often-ranked atop

- Conference USA against both the run
» and the pass. ‘

Additionally, Patterson’s defensive
units are known to play with agdesire and
a will to win that matches the personal-
ity of their coach.“The only thing I can
say is we’ll bring a great deal of passion
and energy and a tempo from the way we
practice,” Patterson said.

Even. with limited time with his new
set of defensive players up.-to this point,
it’s that type of enthusiasm that has
them excited about their energetic new
coach. 1

“I brieﬂy got a chance to talk to him
about the defense, and I could hear the
excitement in his voice and his sense of
love for the game,” junior, Pitt linebacker
Max Gruder said before spring practice
began last week. ‘just talking to him got
me excited about strapping the pads back
on for spring ball.”

“I’m excitedto try this new defense
out and I’ve heard really exciting things
about him,” junior defensive tackle Chas
Alecxih said. ; . .

y The main reason that players‘ like
Gruder and Alecxih hadn’t had the chance
to meet with Patterson much before prac-
tice was that the newly appointedcoach
was on a plane for much of the two weeks
afterhis hiring. . A _

' . After former head coach Dave Wannst-
edt’s resignation from the team in De-
cember and Mike Haywood’s subsequent

' hiring and firing, almost all of Pitt’s re-

cruiting class jumped ship.

That meant Graham, Patterson and the
rest of the staff had to hit the road — or
the sky, for that matter — to persuade
high school athletes to wear the blue-

and—gold. _ -
“In a two—day span I went from Pitts-

burgh to4Cincinnati, Cincinnati to New.

Orleans, New Orleans to Atlanta and At-
lanta back to Pittsburgh,” Patterson, a
Marlow, Okla., native said.

Their work paid off, as they were able‘
to round up a solid recruiting class given
the rough situation they landed in with
only a few weeks to recruit. The class
includes 20 players, highlighted by highly
touted Woodland Hills high school star
Lafayette Pitts. . ‘

“I didn’t really get a chance to really
sit down with Coach Patterson because
he and the ‘coaches were on the recruiting
trail,” Gruder said. “Under the circum-
stances and the time they were given,
they did a very good job on this class.”

Pitt fans will see a change in defen-
sive schematics from former defensive
coordinator Phil Bennett’s 4-3 system in
which four defensive linemen played in
front of threelinebackers.

Instead, Patterson will use a variation
of just the opposite, a 3-4 defense that
relies on pressure from linebackers to
blitz the quarterback.

Yet Panther fans still might see some
shadows of the Wannstedt and Bennett
era, as Graham and his team view the
former Pitt coaches as mentors.

“Coach Patterson and I started off
as high school football coaches, sitting
in a room and listening to Phil Bennett
and Dave Wannstedt talk defense,” Gra-
ham. said. “There’s a lot of similarities
to what we do as far as coverages and
schematics.”. I

Now that Patterson is back in Pitts-
burgh for the time bei-ng,,he can ﬁnally
focus on football and not on traveling, as
well as one other thing: finding his way
around the city — his most immediate
challenge to coaching in Pittsburgh.

“I can get you to the football complex
and I can get you to the Pete, but that’s
about it,” he said last month. ﬂ

pour of 3—pointers and a late go-
ahead shot; The game seemed
to reach a perfect climax when
Butler’s Andrew Smith hit a layup
with 2.2 seconds remaining to
put the Bulldogs up 70-69.

It was a story that was nearly

, impossible to sour, but somehow

I one of the greatest games in each

program’s history turned into an
unmitigated disaster.

Two unintentional fouls were
called in the ﬁnal 1.4 seconds
of the game, both on the floor
and far away from the defensive
team’s basket. That is something
that should never happen in the
sport of basketball,but it did.

And even though it would be

eloquent to just pretend neither
foul was called, doing so is impos-
sible. There was no poetic justice
in the way the game ended.

When it was all said and
done, Pitt got the short end of
the stick.

-The first call — a blocking foul
on Butler’s Shelvin Mack — was
unequivocally necessary. Pitt’s
Gilbert Brown was attempting
to ﬁnd space and set up a half-
court prayer of a shot. The two
clearly bumped into each other,
and Mack’s feet were not set. Had
Mack not established this con-
tact, Brown would have had the
chance to attempt a shot from
halfcourt before time expired.

While this would hardly have
been a high—percentage shot,
it would absolutely have been
possible to make. Even a run—of—
the—mill pickup basketball player
has the ability to make that shot.
Heck, Pitt’s Brad Wanamaker al-
most made an even longer shot at
one point during the night.

Yet Mack clearly prevented
Brown from getting off a shot,
and because of that, the whistle
absolutely had to be blown.

Brown made the first free

throw to tie the game at 70, but

he missed the second. The shot
rimmed out and ﬂew up in the
air. . .

As the ball came down, Pitt’s
Nasir Robinson and Butler’s Matt
Howard battled for rebounding
position. Both Howard and Rob-

inson reached for the ball, but .

Howard pulled it in.

As he did, Robinson’s extend-
ed arm wrapped around How-
ard’s. Robinson quickly realized
that he needed to move his arms,
and he immediately raised them
in the air.

Less than a second remained
in the game, and overtime ap-

_ peared inevitable. Yet for some

reason, referee Antonio Petty

— blew his whistle with 0.8 sec-

onds left. It was a foul call against
Robinson, and it allowed How-
ard to sink a game-winning free-
throw. _

. When the contact was made,
Howard was standing sideways,
with the ball held well below
shoulder level. Meanwhile, Rob-

Endof game foul shouldn’t have been called 

Livingston (20

inson was standing between Howard and .

,:P_itt’s basket. It is simply unreasonable
to think that Howard could have scored

«inthat situation, as wellas‘ to‘think that " 0

"Robinson could pry the ball from How-
ard’s hands and complete a layup before
-time expired. -

‘The score was 70-70 when Robinson

T was called for the foul, and once the ball
entered Howard’s arms,g there was no
-chance of either team completing abuzz-
jer—beater. Considering that Robinson did

not tackle Howard, tear his arm off or stick
aharpoon in him, therewas absolutely no

-‘reason for that call to  made.

 ’ Thisis the reason thatfthis sort of thing
Qnever happens — not‘_/b_ecaus.ev.“smart”
~teams.»do not try to rebo   shots.

When Brownsquared up‘his.siecotid shot,

1.4 seconds remained. -,'I‘hat isabsolutely

enough time for a rebound attempt.

Just. ask Howard, who needed half that
long to square up Butler’s game-winner
against Old Dominionin its tournament
opener. .

When Pitt decided to have Robinson
and Gary McGhee in place to get there-
bound off a possible Brown miss, the team

made the right decision. It was the nation’s _

eighth—best rebounding team this season.
Butler -ranked just 177*. The Panthers were
leading the rebound battle 30-20. T

It would have been insane for Pitt head
coach Jamie Dixon to have McGhee and
Robinson play back behind the foul line.

Once Howard had the ball, Robinson
probably should have backed off. Perhaps
being a little less zealous might have pre-
vented the call. ‘

But it is ludicrous to claim that Robin-
son’s actions indicate a lack of basketball
IQ. Robinson reached for the ball, and he
kept his arms going for a split-second. It
was a poor decision for him to put his arm
on Howard’s, but the whole sequence took
place in well under a second.

This is not “Clockstoppers.” Robinson
did not have, the opportunity to slow time
down, or evaluate a situation with contin-
ued slow-motion looks. He made a very
slight mistakein a very rapid sequence
of events. To call him “stupid” for doing
so is simply ignorant. _

Neither Robinson nor Pitt “deserved”
to lose this game. There is no such thing
as “deserving” to win or lose. A team’s
resume, 3-point shooting, clock manage-
ment, coaching and past are sexy things
to look back on, but they do not make
the team any more or less deserving of a
victory. The only thing that determines
a winner is the number of points a team
scores compared to its opponent. I

Rules are a vital part of sports, but
they are there for a reason. They allow
for games to be structured, fair and safe.

But they are simply not meant to be en-

forced inthe manher that they were on
Saturday. Z i

There are a number of officiating con- '

ventions in sportsfthat are unwritten, yet

obvious. Hockeyreferees give leeway on
icing calls, football and basketball coaches

can step a foot or; two in bounds during.

play and basketball players are not whis-
tled for fouls on the ﬂoor 90 feet from the
basket‘ with less than a second left.

Pitt vs. Butler was a beautiful game and

was no reason for Petty to call a foul on
Robinson, other than to enforce a hypo-

thetical zero—tolerance policy that sports .

has never embraced. -

The call was completely unnecessary,
and it robbed college basketball of a truly
great game. .

So do not blame Dixon or any Pitt
player for losing this game. Dixon‘ could
have run less clock, Brown could have
made the second free throw and Robinson
could have rebounded differently. It is a

sign of class and maturity that each takes
the blame for his shortcoming, but this is
not on them. .

If Pitt really deserved to lose this game
and Butler deserved to win it, then that

would have become clear in overtime. -

But now, because of overzealous officiat-
ing, we will never know. And as players,
coaches, students and fans, we deserved
better.
