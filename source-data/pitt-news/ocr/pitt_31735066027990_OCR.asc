Piﬂ at sea: riding a I 5-year wave

Benjamin Jackson

   

The Love Boat docked at the University
of Pittsburgh back in 1980.

Or so many Pitt faculty thought when
Semester at Sea ﬁrst began. It was spring
term 1981 that the program made its ﬁrst
voyage after moving its headquarters to Pitt.

Last Friday marked Semester at Sea’s

15th year at Pitt. And during that time, per-
ceptions about the program have grown
along with it.

“On all voyages, I saw a small percent-
age of students who went just to surf around
the world. But by the end of the voyage, they
were much more empathetic with other
countries,” said Dr. Harry Corwin, a Pitt pro-
fessor who has been on the voyage three
times and served as the academic dean in the

Preventative medicine

Seminars teach students how to avoid rape

Anne Estonilo

A criminal needs three elements to pull off a crime.

“He has to have the desire, the ability, and the opportunity.
What you want to do is to eliminate the opportunity,” said Ofﬁcer
Frank D. Lewis of Zone 6.

Sexual offenders target both men and women, and a college
campus is the perfect playground for assailants.

Look around Pitt’s campus one night on your way to Hillman
Library. The campus is well—1it along many walkways, but there are
many areas where someone can attack you without being seen.

Protecting yourself against assault doesn’t mean locking your-

self indoors and boarding up your home.While you can’t always
prevent an assault, there are steps you can take to make yourself less
of a target both to stranger rapes —— sexual assault by someone you
don’t know -— as well as acquaintance rape — sexual assault by
someone you know or have had Contact with before.

‘Trust your instincts about a situation,” said one advocate, who
is a victim herself and asked that her name be withheld. “I’ve
worked with many, many women for assault, and often there is
something that makes them uncomfortable at some point that they
don’t listen to, because they don’t want to make a scene or draw
attention to themselves.”

spring of 1992.

Since 1981, over 15,000 students from
869 colleges and universities from around
the United States have spent a semester on
the ﬂoating campus. Included in that number
are 504 Pitt undergrads, 119 faculty, and 101
stalf members.

Throughout its existence, the program
has had its share ofups and downs, but has
always tried to maintain a commitment to its

Spring is upon us once again, and
despite the relief of relatively warm
weather, a type of anxiety remains for
many graduating seniors: getting a job.

Although many college students
ﬁnd it difficult to get jobs after gradua-
tion, ﬁve young entrepreneurs, all stu-
dents or recent graduates of the
University of Pittsburgh, have created
not only jobs for themselves but produc-
tive businesses.

They have learned to market their
talents in theater, music, and photogra-
phy, and have turnedartistic interests into
proﬁtable careers. '

incites neighbors to near-riot

Around the World

JERUSALEM ——- An Israeli botanist is
adding new fuel to the debate over the ori-
 of the Shroud of Turin.

The Hebrew University scientist says
dozens of plants whose images appear on
the mysterious shroud come from the
Jerusalem area, suggesting the cloth origi-
nated in the Holy Land.

He says one plant grows in Israel.
Believers revere the shroud as the burial
cloth of Jesus. But the Roman Catholic
Church doesn’t recognize it as a relic, and
scientists remain divided over where it came
ﬁom.

The shroud was rescued over the week-
end from a ﬁre that badly damaged the
caﬂiedralin Turin, Italy.

TEHRAN, Iran — Iranian protests against
Germany turned violent yesterday in Tehran.

Hundreds of rock—throwing students
fought with Iranian troops outside the
German Embassy.

Riot police stood six—deep, with arms
linked, to keep the protesters from storming
the embassy. At one point, the police bran-
dished shotguns tomake the crowd back off.

The protests follow a German court rul-
ing last week. The ruling irrrplicated Iranian
leaders in a 1992 assassinationin Berlin.

More than 100,000 people protested
outside the embassy yesterday, but there was
no violence.

Across the Nation

WHITE HOUSE —— President and Mrs.
Clinton are among the legions of last-
minute tax filers this year. The White

House says the Clintons just met
Sunday morning with their accountant.
They were expected to file later in the
day.

PHILADELPHIA —~ Tensions were
high in a south Philadelphia neighbor-
hood yesterday where a racial protest
march took place.

The march involved about 500 peo-
ple, most of them black. Whites came
out on their front steps and then turned

-their backs on the marchers. At one

point there was a brief scufﬂe, but
police managed to quickly end it. At
least 800 police are still in the neigh-
borhood.

The march was in response to the
beating of a black family by a mob of
white men in February.

SAN FRANCISCO —-— First, red wine
— and now freshly brewed coffee. A
chemist at the University of California
at Davis says the aroma from a steam-
ing cup of coffee forms powerful anti-
oxidants believed to help prevent can-
cer.

But Takayuki Shibamoto says it’s
not enough just to smell the coffee. The
compounds escape into the air quickly,
so he says you need to drink the bever-
age within 20 minutes after it’s brewed.

But Shibamoto’s claim is still
hypothetical. He says much more
research is needed to show whether cof-
fee is actually healthy.

Shibamoto, who prefers fresh Kona
blends for his own morning pick—me-
up, presents his idea to other chemists
this week at a meeting in San Francisco.

Al’ «.554 u h

 

Growing up in Rochester, N.Y.,
Professor Shona Sharif learned more
about European history than any other
ﬁeld of history. In fact, the only history she
was taught about African Americans was a
single paragraph on slavery.

From that paragraph Sharif observed
that African-American history was virtual-
ly ignored in her history courses. Ever
since settling in Pittsburgh in 1986, Sharif
has committed herself to teaching others
about African—related cultures and experi-
ences.

Working words

Sharif has coordinated such local pro-
jects as the dance production of “Black
Nativity” — a project she has carried out
for the past three years.

“We went to St. Clair Village and
taught the children how to play the drums
and dance. During the winter months we
would prepare for [Black Nativity].
They’ve been in Black Nativity for the
past three years,” said Sharif.

Working with the black community
has continued to be an important goal, says
Sharif. She has also contributed to educat-
ing students about African—American cul-
ture here at Pitt as a professor of Africana
studies. _

Some campus ﬁgures say that Sharif

has been very essential to the curriculum. ‘

Professor Andrienne Andrews has worked
with Sharif since 1994.

Andrews says that Sharif has pro-
duced excellent results in the department
in both her duties as professor and as an
Africana studies adviser.

“I’ve noticed an increase in recruit-
ment and in retaining student majors in the
department [of Africana studies],” said
Andrews.

According to Andrews, Sharif has
enriched the classes by speaking publicly
about health issues. “Professor Sharif
shares information and books and articles
related to my course.”

Harry Mudd, vice president of the
Black Action Society, is currently enrolled
in Sharif’s West African dance class.

According to Mudd, when the Black
Action Society kicked off Black Week last
semester, he saw Sharif and her students
dancing at one of the workshops. Mudd
says that during the workshop, he saw
children dancing and soon felt compelled
to join in. ‘

“It was at that point I decided I would
take that class, and now I’m glad I did,”
said Mudd.

Mudd says Sharif’s concern for stu-
dents shows that she really cares. He also
says Sharif’s contributions aren’t limited
to the narrow scope of the classroom,

 

THE PITT NEWS

Africana Studies professor
brings love to life in class

where many professors choose to end their
contributions.

“In my opinion, [Professor Sharif] is
very open and can be easily approached,”
said Mudd. “But she’s not a pushover.”

Sharif says this stems from her
upbringing.

Growing up strong _

Sharif attended the Antioch Baptist
Church and belonged to the gospel choir.
Her father was well—respected because he
had his own gospel singing group.
Sometimes Sharif would tag along as her
father and his group sang at different
churches. .

Although she says her father was
strict, Sharif developed a love for perforrn—
ing due to his inﬂuence.

“I participated in every Sunday-
school program. As I got older, I began
teaching Sunday school, but that faded
when I left for college,” Sharif said.

Earlier in her life, she met a man at the
community center. All the kids called him
Mr. Denny, and he had a tremendous
amount of inﬂuence over them.

According to Sharif, Mr. Denny orga-
nized a group of kids called the
Aristocrats. “We would take trips to differ-
ent places. I remember he had us raise

‘money for charities and a ball we had

downtown once,” Sharif said.

According to Sharif, everything
seemed to be normal until she got to high
school. In high school, Sharif recalls that
she never really thought about going to
college, and it was coincidence that she
had taken a number of college preparatory
classes.

Sharif said the only college she
applied to was Howard University because
a representative of it came to her school.

After earning a_ bachelor’s degree
from Howard, Sharif came to Pitt for grad
school. She received her rnaster’s of edu-
cation degree in 1986 and went back to
Washington, D.C., for a few years. After
she got married, she returned to Pittsburgh.

Making a home

After the death of Black Studies
Professor Bob Johnson in 1971, Sharif
was offered his position. She says it was
the middle of the semester when she took
over the African—American dance class.

“The University knew I had experi-
ence performing, so they asked ifl would
take over the class,” said Sharif.

As a professor in Africana studies,
Sharif has contributed to the curriculum.
For example, she has helped to bring more
African—related dance classes to Pitt.

These include Afro—Caribbean Dance,
African—American Health Issues, Dance
History, and West African Dance. Sharif
teaches African—American Dance, the

inal Jon Spencer Blues Explosion version.

Kulp celebrated his 21st birthday in
December with the ﬁnal performance of his
second independent directorial effort, ‘The
Nick Cave Plays.” Just before midnight, the
audience joined cast members and ﬁiends in
singing “Happy Birthday” to the director of
the collection of offbeat, one-act plays. Kulp
says midnight is his favorite time to put on
productions, although that is later than tradi-
tional evening show times. Midnight perfor-
mances, he says, give both the cast and the
audience time to wind down so that every-
one can enjoy the show.

Kulp created a grand performance out

of three short one-act plays written by

English singer and playwright Nick Cave.
The lack of stage and lighting direction
in the “Nick Cave” scripts permitted Kulp’s
interpretation, which ultimately conﬁrmed
him and Harms as vanguards in theater. The
“Nick Cave” audience moved about the stu-
dio theater in the Cathedral of Learning
basement while following the action of each
cabaret—style play on ﬁve small, separate
stages. Live scenes, which often occurred
simultaneously, incorporated ﬁlm, loud

‘ music, and dim lighting. The over—the—top

depictions of debauchery culminated in a
scene with Hamts pretending to shoot up,
while perched atop a throne on the central
stage high above the audience. When it was
all over, Kulp lit an A Fuente special—edition
cigar to celebrate.

Kulp, who graduated after only three
and one-half years at Pitt, has plans to move

to New York City to audition. Harms is

moving to Arizona to write and make ﬁlms.
Before they go, the pair are going to pull off
one more show.

Acting it out

Intravenous, or I.V. Productions, was
born out of both partners’ frustrations with
their respective academic departments.
Harms was a ﬁlm student, Kulp a theater
major. Their paths crossed in a directing
class at Pitt during the fall of ‘94.

The two admired each‘other’s work in
the class and discovered that they shared a
disenchantment with traditional theater.

“The idea of theater has taken on new
meaning in the last 100 years,” Kulp says.

“There’s an expectation,” Harms says,
jumping in. “People sit down and they’re
really just watching. If you want that, you
can just go to the movies.” ’

“People get angry if actors mess up their
lines, and say, ‘Oh, I didn’t get my money’s
worth.’ They forget the actors are real people
and everything is real.”

The two began working together, cast-
ing each other in ﬁlms and plays for their
classes. “I took my ﬁrst ﬁlm class the fol-
lowing summer, and Aaron helped me out,”
Kulp says.

“I was technical adviser,” Harms notes.

In the fall of ‘95, Kulp directed
“Action,” a Sam Shepard play, as a lab for
the Pitt Theater and again cast Harms.

In the spring of ‘96, Kulp took another
ﬁlm class and cast Harms and his new wife,
Tanya, in his project.

Meanwhile, Harms was making ﬁlms

for Pitt’s production of “Enrico,” directed by
David Pelligrini of the University’s theater
department.

“I needed a format to show these small
ﬁlms I was maldng,” says Harms. “What do
you say, ‘Oh, come see this ﬁlm, it’s 10 min-
utes long.’ Nobody sees them but the people

inyour class.”
“We started I.V. :
because we weren’t happy,” 

Kulp says. “We both dis— 
liked the same things. I 
don’t like theater or theater 
people. We crisscrossed into 
each other’s realms. We 
don’tcallit theater,” he goes 
on to explain. “That word 
carries expectations with it 
that we don’t have the 
desire to fulﬁll.” What I.V. 
Productions does is more an 
all—around performance 
than traditional theater, but 
they don’t call their work 
performance art, either.

“It’s bold, and hasn’t really been done
before. Theater’s a very good forum for film.
It’s live  Harms says, coining a phrase.
“We’re performing with the ﬁlm, or against
it. It’s hard to define. In a live performance,
there’s a hole that’s not ﬁll 

“It’s not exactly audience interaction,”
Kulp says, completing Harms’ point. “But it
creates its own world. You’re not just watch-
ing someone doing something,” Kulp
explains. “People don’t know to watch the
ﬁlm or the play. I don’t care, it’s all there.
And there’s this overwhelming sound com-
ing from the speakers. It’s what you take

from it. Everyone has their own interpreta-
tion.” '

In the spring of 1995, Kulp directed
“Twenty—Seven Wagons Full of Cotton” for
a directing class, Hanns acted in it. While
rehearsing for the play, Harms wrote a more
modern version based on the original
Tennessee Williams script in lieu of a paper
due for a “Women in
Film” class.

Harms’ professor was not
amused when he turned in
the script for his play,
“Twenty—Seven,” instead
of an essay. A year later,
though, it was Harms‘
“Twenty-Seven” that
sparked plans for I.V.
Productions and its first
performance.

Kulp recently received

sent the “Nick Cave
Plays” the following fall,
to star Harms yet again.
“We both weren’t doing anything that sum-
mer and we knew people who could act,”
Kulp says. So they cast undergraduate actors
from Pitt — Sue Galloway, Brent Korson,
and Chris Rath — and began rehearsing for
a dual—production of “Twenty—Seven
Wagons Full of Cotton” and Harms’ version,
‘Twenty—Seven.”

Rath appeared only in the film that sup
plemented the live scenes of “Twenty-
Seven,” which was projected on the wooden
garage door of the Sip Cafe and which

mance. This technique affected
the audience’s experience and
interpretation of the performance,
which would not have been possi-
ble if Rath had been openly visible
on stage with the other actors.

‘“Twenty-Seven’ is a visual
piece with strange characters,”
Harms explains. ‘‘There’s the
same basis and same problems [as
in ‘“l"wenty—Seven Wagons Full of
Cotton”], but bolder characters
who aren’t restricted to 19503
views.” Harms and Kulp agreed
that both plays performed together
would tell a different story, a big-
ger story. “‘Twenty-Seven
Wagons Full of Cotton’ is a
reﬁned story,” Harms explains.
“‘Twenty—Seven’ breaks the circle
and makes it open again.”

They put the show on at n1id—
night in the Sip Cafe, which had
just moved to an old garage in
Shadyside and wasn’t yet open for
business. Harms and Kulp had to
change locations when their origi-
nal deal with Dusquesne
University’s Luciano’s Cafe fell
through weeks into rehearsals for
the show.

Showtime

Kulp ' and Harms took the
cast to the Red, White, and Blue
used-clothing store off Route 51
and said, “All right, start looking

    

  

Benefits include:

for your character.” They spent
$60 on costumes for the four
actors. They printed ﬂiers and

hung them around Oakland and ..

Shadyside, then invited local
newspapers to come review the
show.

“We didn’t expect other peo-
ple to take us seriously.” But they
did. “It was funny to see our pic-
tures in the paper,” K11lp says.

“We wanted it to be loud and
impressive,” Harms states.

“We’re both for loudness,”
Kulp adds, grinning and nodding
his head. The two fronted about
$250 to rent the lighting and
sound equipment and spent
another $200 to use it for four
weeks.

“We got Rock ‘n’ Roll Lights
to do this. I didn’t know anything
about lighting,” K11lp admits.

Add to the tab nights at Mad
Mex where the cast would drown
their sorrows in cerveza and
nachos when morale was low.

The deal Intravenous made
with Luciano’s Cafe to put on the
play had fallen through, so they
conﬁnued rehearsing throughout
the summer without knowing
where, when, or even if the show
would be performed.

To add to the confusion, audi-
tions for the “Nick Cave” plays
were held two nights before the

opening night of ‘Twenty-
Seven.” I.V. Productions hadn’t
paid for the rights to ‘Twenty-
Seven Wagons Full of Cotton,” so
they couldn’t charge the audience
admission.

They sold beer at the show so
that people could relax and also to
help turn a proﬁt. The show was
free to the public, but they gladly
accepted donations at the door,
which earned them over $800.
I.V.3s founders had spent nearly
that amount on the production,
not expecting to break even.

But the success of “Twenty-
Seven” was worth more than the
small proﬁt Intravenous saw.
Kulp and Harms say they deﬁ-
nitely foresee working together
again in the future, but that for
now they each need to pursue sep-
arate roads. “I don’t want to get
too comfortable here,” Kulp says.
“Comfort scares me.” AH they’1l
say about their third and ﬁnal pro-
duction in the works is that they
have a script, a theoretical place,
and a theoretical cast. “In theory,
it’s a good show,” Kulp jokes.
Harms says they’re shooting for
early March as an opening date.
“Dude, it’s February 3rd,” Kulp
says, looking at his watch.

Dunharn Workshop (also known
as Afro—Caribbean Dance),
Comparative Dance Expression,
West African Dance, and
African—American Health
Issues.

Since 1987, Sharif has been
the artistic director of the

African Drum and Dance-

Ensemble. The ensemble fea-
tures master dance and drurn—
ming classes, lecture demonstra-
tions, participatory perfor-
mances, and theatrical produc-
tion such as, “Osei Tutu,”
“African Fables,” and “Black
Nativity.” '

According to Sharif, she ini-
tiated the idea for the CRATE-
Cultural Residency Awareness
Teaching Exhibition— project.
She says she’s received a num-
ber of grants for the CRATE
project.

The project took less than a
year to put together, and due to
its success it was re-funded the
following year (1994-95). The

funding was provided by the-

Pittsburgh Foundation and the
Howard Heinz Endowment.
Sharif and the African
Drum and Dance Ensemble
worked in collaboration with
three other organizations.
Among them were the
Multicultural Arts Initiative,

”At a time when
suffer from perhaps the
gravest social problems
of any group in the ll.$.,
how do we ensure that
they grow up in the best
environment possible?”

 FROM PAGE 3

Pittsburgh Magazine, and the
Pittsburgh branches of the
Carnegie Library.

The project was presented
in two segments.

The ﬁrst consisted of a lec-
ture on “Slavery and African
Slave Ports,” the “Slave Trade in
Islands in the New World,” and
“Pittsburgh’s Road to
Freedom.”

The second segment pre-
sented “Swing Low, Sweet in
the Momin’” which was per-
formed by the Aﬁican Drum and
Dance Ensemble.

Before presenting the pro-
ject, Sharif says she went abroad
to gain more insight for it. “I
went to Goree, Senegal, and saw
the slave ports. It was an experi-
ence that I’ll never forget,” said
Sharif.

“I guess teaching Aﬁican
dance makes it that much easier
since it’s my culture. But I still
think I’m an international per-
son,” Sharif said.

Professor Sharif noted sirn—
ply that she hopes to continue
teaching classes and dance,
learning, and getting her doctor-
ate.

“I hope to get better with
age, but basically just continue
doing the things I’ve been
doing,” said Sharif.

THE PITT NEWS

 

Remember that even, the seemingly
most basic act can take practice. For
instance, you may believe that you will trust
your instincts when you’re uncomfortable,
but too often date rapes occur because a
woman incorrectly labels her instinct as an
“overreaction.”

If someone makes you uncomfortable,
walk away from him and keep your dis-
tance. Listen to your feelings. If you’re at a
party, stay with people you trust until you
are in control of your situation.

According to the Center for Violence
fact sheet, “Eight in 10 college rapes
involved someone the attacker knew; more
than half involved a date.” -

The fact sheet also states that 6 to 8 per-
cent of these rapes occurred in off-campus
housing or in a car.

Ofﬁcer Ashley Thompson of the

Pittsburgh Police Zone 6 Station talks to
groups about personal safety. He said “being
aware of your surroundings” is imperative.

“Be aware of street signs, and look con-
ﬁdent in your walk,” Thompson said. “Look
like you know where you’re going, even if
you don’t. Criminals are looking for an easy
hit.”

Criminals often choose their victims by
the way they carry themselves and not nec-
essarily by their size or sex. Thompson also
stressed that it is important to make eye con-
tact with someone who makes you uncom-
fortable.

‘This tells them that you’ve seen them
and can identify them. Looking away is
seen as a sign of weakness,” he said.

Lewis said that if you’re being attacked,
yell “FIRE!” to alert other people. He said
the reason for yelling this is that ﬁre threat-

ens bystanders’ protection as well as the vic-
tim’s and will provoke them to react faster.

At night, if you’re home
and an intruder has broken
into your building, the offi-
cers suggest keeping the
lights off. ,

“You have an advantage
because you know your own
home better than the intruder
does,” Thompson said.

Thompson also said that
if you know an intruder is in
your home and you can’t
stay on the phone, if you dial
911 and leave the receiver

and do it on a comparative basis,” Corwin
“said.

A potential major setback for the pro-
gram came in 1983, when the S.S. Universe,
Semester at Sea’s ﬂoating campus, ran
aground off Alexandria, Egypt.

“They were going to abort the whole
journey,” said Arthur Goldberg.

Goldberg and his partner, Lionel
Druker, run a travel company in Israel and
helped the stranded voyagers tum what
Goldberg called “a disastrous beginning into
a fabulous ending.”

The groups worked with the Hebrew
University in Jerusalem to set up a private
university in Israel.

But running aground was not the only
tragedy on that particular voyage: the acade-
micdeanalsodiedofaheartattackThe
ship’s staff held a fimeral for him in Israel.

“We had romances and people eventu-
ally married local people. We had tragedies;
one of the deans died and we had a funeral.
We setup a university in 24 hours,” Druker
said. “We had taken over a hotel, ananged
meals and lectine rooms, and the mark of our
success was that nobody left to go home.”

The program faced more trouble after
its ill fated 1983 adventure. In 1994, the ship
was stalled yet again. This time it was in the

And last year the program met with
more misfortune when
several program mem-
bers were killed in a
bus accident in India

“If I had my way, Semester at Sea
would be a [requirement] for every under-

Lois Cudrnore has been on the trip
 The senior citizen ﬁom Ontario,
Canada, ﬁrst heard about the trip when she
was on a pleasure cruise aboard the S.S.
Universe in 1990.

Her granddaughter went on the fall

“I enjoyed it so muc ,” said Cudmore.

Among its other programs, Semester at
Sea has been doing an outreach with the
local middle and high schools.

The students correspond with college
students on the ship and receive culture
packets containing newspapers, menus,

ence the voyage vicariously.

“Our math teacher told us at the begin-

ning of the year we were writing to people,” .

Gaines said ‘They sent us postcards and
candy wrappers from various countries.”

She is now excited to one day go on the
trip.

Currently, there are 43 Pitt students on
board the S.S. Universe out of 663 students.
It is the largest emollment ever for Semester
at Sea.

Onboand, the program celebrated its 15
years on April 11, as the S.S. Universe
arrived in Manila, the Philippines. They
were joined in celebration by Fidel Ramos,
the cunent president of the Philippines.

Here in Pittsburgh, Pitt celebrated by
holding a reception.

At the reception, Shannon Murphy, the
daughter of Pittsburgh Mayor Tom Murphy,
read a proclamation from the rnayor’s oﬁice
declaring last Friday “Semester at Sea Day”
— in observance of the program’s cornbina—
tion of academic excellence and cross—cul-
tural experience. ’

For Shannon Murphy, a participant in
the spring ‘94 voyage, it was not only the
cross-cultural experience abroad, but also
what she leamed about her home that was
valuable.

“I loved the trip,” said Shannon
Murphy. “I think you bring things back with
you. I met people from around the country
and in Pittsburgh that I never knew before.”

Let us help you to remember
what not to do this week

Since it’s the week before ﬁnals, and things do tend to
get rather hectic this week, we have a few things that we
would like to remind you of.

The Top Five Things Not to Do
as the Semester Winds Down

1. Do not try to push an unwanted sublettor on your
unsuspecting roommate as you plan to head off for the summer.
Yes, we know that you really can’t afford to pay rent on a place
in which you will not be residing, but remember, you aren’t the
one who is going to have to live with the psychotic schizo-
phrenic that you sponge off on your roommate. Your roommate
will. So, the decision of who should be able to sublet your apart-
ment should be your roon1rnate’s, not your own. How would
you like it if Freddy Krueger showed up in your living room
one morning claiming to be your new roommate?

2. Don’t fall into the trap of thinking that since the semes-
ter is almost over that it is over already, and become a major
slacker. It ain’t over ‘til the fat lady sings, and she ain’t gonna
sing until you take your last ﬁnal. Yeah, it sucks, but that’s life.

3. Don’t stay up studying for your ﬁnals so late that you
can’t wake up when morning comes around, and -it’s actually
the time to take the test. ‘Professors really don’t ﬁnd it amusing
when you show up to take a final in your pjs,’ so try not to burn
the candle at both ends. It’s good to study. It is not good to
deprive yourself of sleep by studying to the point that when test
time rolls around you’re having hallucinations.

4. Don’t be late in filing your taxes. The post office
downtown on Grant Street has window service open until mid-
night. If you are late in ﬁling, your financial aid will be late too.
If you get free money, don’t blow it by forgetting to do your
taxes.

5. Last but not least, don’t forget to call your mom. We
know you’re busy with studying, last minute partying, and the
whatnot, but be sure not to forget about dear old mom in the

process.

All women 5

Every woman should know
martial arts. It should be a required
course in high schools and universi-
ties for females, and men should
only be taught it if they become
monks.

Women need to be able to
defend themselves in this society
against such sickos as those who
would rape them In a society such as
ours, where rape runs rampant and
neighbors kill neighbors over the sid-
ing on their houses, the innocent
need to know how to protect them-
selves. To make matters worse, this
society has socialized many people
into believing that women are physi-
cally inferior and unable to defend
themselves. Society has given us
roles to play ——- roles which need to
be broken if we are to survive.

Rape is surely the most inhu-
manactIcanthinkof.Rapeoften
causes greater psychological dam-
age than any dysfunctional, talk-
show childhood ever could. \V1th
thatinmind, you might thinkthatwe
would be doing everything possible
to help women protect themselves
from the assholes of this world. You
might think that we’d show women
how to ﬁght for themselves in case
they might someday have to save
their sanity, if not their lives.

But many women won’t hear it.
Socialization has taught us that
women are physically inferior, and
that a big, strong man will be able to
doanything he wantstoasmall, frail
lady.That’s bullshit.

Most women might not be
designed with as much muscle mass
as men, but you only need so much
in order to move. It takes about 12
pounds of pressure to break a grown

houldlearn martial arts

man’s knee at the correct angle, and
a 12-year-old girl with no training
can produce about 120 pounds of
pressure. That.makes her physically
capable of disabling an NFL line-
man, but if she doesn’t know the cor-
rect angle, she might as well have no
legs at all.

That’s what so-called rape-pre-
vention classes are all about —edu—
cation. They can teach you the cor-
rectangle. They cantip the scales by
providing the most powerful
weapon ever invented — knowl-
edge.

You see, our society has tried to
teachusthatbiggerisbettemhatthe
more muscular person is going to
win, and that’s just not true! For a
couple thousand years, Eastern civi-
lizationhasspentagreatdealoftime
developing techniques to allow a
smaller person to overcome a larger
person. It’s possible. You just need to
know how.

And why wouldn’t you want to
leam? Of course, I’m not saying that
knowing these things will save
everybody. I’m not trying to put all
the responsibility on the victim’s
shoulders. All I’m saying is, if it’s
possible to learn something that
could save your life, why not take a
little time to leam it?

I’ve had a friend tell me that she
doesn’t like the term rape prevention
because it sounds to her like we’re
saying that rape is the victim’s fault.
Perhaps I’m just being obtuse, but I
don’t see how that makes any sense.
I think she’s mistaken about what
we’re teaching at these classes. We
are not telling women not to wear
short skirts or not to ﬂirt with men.
But we do try to teach them how to
identify problems before it becomes
too late, and then, how to do some-
thing about it if things get rough.

There are lots of things that peo-
ple don’t know or think about that
they should. There are things like
having your keys ready before you
get to your car, not walking around a
dangerous place in high heels, how
to break out of any person’s grip
around your wrist, and just how to
stand in a conﬁdent manner so that

you’re able to kick a guy in his

kneecap and run if need be. These
are simple things that anyone can be
taught, and if they rrrean that you
might be able to get away alive,
wouldn’t it be worth the time to
learn?
Weneedtodosomethingtobal-
ance the scales. We need to get
knowledge to the people who may
need it someday. Ofcourse, I think
we should be executing rapists by
slow dismemberrnent, but that’s only
punishment after the fact and not
prevention. That won’t deter people
who think they won’t get caught.

And punishment won’t deter people ,

who think that a woman might not
press charges against someone she
knows if she’s squeamish about the
punishment itself. We need to
empower women to protect them-
selves when they can before things
get that far.

I wholeheartedly think that.

rapists should be executed. And I
think we should teach women how
to stop a rapist before he kills her.
You may notice that I have talked
about saving one’s life when I talk
about rape. That's because the rapes
that don’t end in psychological dam-
age, which can change one’s life for-

ever, end in death. Remember that. _

Rape is not a crime of passion; rape
is a crime of violence.

Kris Kissel believes that there isn’t a
woman alive who couldn't kick 
butt if she knew the right moves.

THE PI'l"I' NEWS 9

The campus sage looks
back at his 17 years at Pitt

 

First in a series of “parting shots.”

“The University of Pittsburgh — the
greatest 17 years of your life.”

That’s not exactly the time frame
most people have in mind when it comes
to getting a college degree, but that’s
exactly how long it’s taken me to get
through here. And do you know what? I
never once regretted coming back in
1993 and ﬁnishing up; actually I had
plarmed to all along.

' This time around, of course, I had to
do it the hard way — at night, after work-
ing a day job. On top of that, I didn’t have
a car for most of that time, so many of my
days went a good 16 hours when I fac-
tored in PAT transit.

Was it worth it? No question about
that. I entered this University a mere
child, but I’m leaving it a man. But I
don’t say that just because of the mere
knowledge I’ve accumulated since 1980.

You see, the educational process, or
more accurately my understanding of it,
has evolved tremendously since I first
walked the halls of this University as a
student (as a “townie,” I have spent some
time here before). Before, I believed that
my purpose here was to come in, study
hard, come out after four years, and walk
right into a high-paying job where I
would be ﬁnancially set for life. And
because of my unstable domestic situa-
tion, I found myself in a fog my first three
years of school.

These days, however, I have a good
idea of who I am and what I stand for —
being placed on academic suspension in
1983 plus my parents’ subsequent separa-
tion (although I don’t recommend either)
really helped me to ﬁgure these things
out. For the ﬁrst time in my life, I started
to think for myself, deciding my goals
and aspirations, and speaking my mind
wherever appropriate —— and now I make
the Dean’s List! I now believe thats what
education is all about; but then again,
I’ve been saying that for a while. And if
you’re wondering, I already have a job
— as a news assistant for the Pittsburgh
Post-Gazette.

The university culture has changed
as well. The football team used to sell
out, but not anymore; with men’s basket-
ball, it’s just the opposite. The Greek sys-
tem consisted of your stereotypical beer
bashes and sorority princesses; thanks to
reforms that began in 1983, some of that
has changed. (Unfortunately, I also lost
my fraternity, Zeta Beta Tau.)

Student political involvement has
also shifted. When I arrived, the people
making the most noise were part of the

Marxist-oriented International
Committee Against Racism; now, it’s the
right-wing cadre which put out The
Phoenix.

In my tenure at The Pitt News, the
name of my section has changed, from
“Perspectives” to “Opinions” to “Views.”
But when I started at Pitt, the paper pub-
lished on Mondays, Wednesdays, and
Fridays and didn’t have staff columnists.

And with the intemet, I could take
advantage of another tool which made
another of my hobbies — I’ve always
been a proliﬁc letter writer — a lot easier
and cheaper. Now I don’t have to spend
money on stationery and pens. Thank
God for electronic mail!

Things do indeed change in a decade
and a half.

Before I ﬁnish, I need to thank the
following:

- Dr. and Mrs. James Kelly, Jr., my
mom and stepdad, for believing in me
enough to help pay for this.

0 Beth Roncace, who also saw
enough promise to chip in. Your invest-
ment is paying off.

0 Thom and Cathy Hickling of
Expression, a local ‘Christian monthly
newspaper, for giving me a forum to
express my somewhat unorthodox views.

- Mark Elfstrand of WORD-FM,
same as above, and also for giving me
valuable radio experience. You are help-
ing me fulﬁll some higher purpose.

- Conservative activist and former La
Roche College Professor Bill Donohue,
who helped me get on Mark’s radio
show.

- My colleagues at the P-G and these
people in particular: Mark Warnick, Ellen
Perlmutter, and Bill Moushey (all
instructors of mine), Local Editor Tom
Birdsong and Assistant to the Editor Matt
Kennedy.

0 A special shout to former P-G
Senior Editor Clarke Thomas, a mentor
and valuable contact. Things would have
been a lot harder without you.

- My colleagues, past and present, at
The Pitt News. You made this “old man”
feel welcome.

- Patsy Sims of the English
Department, who showed more conﬁ-
dence in my writing than I did.

- Harry Dowling, my roommate,
with whom I thrashed a lot of stuff out.

0 Trish Metz and Carol Tracy, two
special women in my life. I love you
both.

0 The Shadyside Presbyterian and
Allegheny Center Alliance Churches, for
your prayerful support.

0 And most importantly, you, my
readers, for letting me know over the
years I connected with you. As a writer, I
can ask for nothing more.

Rick Nowlin doesn’t see all, know all, or
tell all — it just looks that way.

Newt

Just over two years ago,
Gingrich came to Washington at the apex
of his power. His party had won a historic
victory in the 1994 elections. A record 71

. freshmen made up the vanguard of his new

majority, a majority committed to enacting
Gingrich’s ambitious agenda (the so-called
“Contract With America”). At the begin-
ning of 1995, the Republicans envisioned a
total realignment of America’s political
structure. Gingrich talked grandly about
the “sweep of history” and considered
himself to be a latter-day Winston
Churchill.

How things have changed. The GOP
congressional majority narrowly survived
in 1996 by abandoning Bob Dole. Their
ambitious program of social engineering to
have Social Security and Medicare cut, or
environmental regulations lessened, left a
bitter taste in the mouths of the voters who
hadn’t voted in 1994. Their “more ethical
than thou” attitude toward the White
House was tarnished when Gingrich was
fined $300,000 for disregarding congres-
sional ethics by getting a sweetheart deal
on a book contract. Recently, the magazine
The New Republic ran a humorous story
entitled ‘The Madness of Speaker Newt”
(a clever tip of the hat to the film The
Madness of King George) detailing the
increasing apathy with which Gingrich’s
followers now hold their former prophet.
Even The Weekly Standard, a magazine

THE PI'l"l' NEWS

which typically follows the Republican
Party line (and which was created by
Rupert Murdoch, the man whose publish-
ing company gave Gingrich the $4.5-mi1-
lion dollar book deal) without criticism,
bravely went out on a limb andattacked

Gingrich, questioning his worthiness to

lead the Republican Party.

The steady string of defeats the
Republicans have
suffered since their
remarkable victory in
1994 has afflicted the
Republicans in
Congress with a
gloomy attitude
toward the future.
The author of The
New Republic article

noted the somber atti-
tude of the
Republicans in

Congress now: “The
revolutionaries of the
104th Congress, now sadly diminished as
the seat—holders of the 105th, wander aim-
lessly from vote to vote — and with every
vote just a few too many defect.” The arti-
cle went on to point out that in 1996 the
House Republicans had already passed 50
bills by March. This year they voted on
three bills (all defeated) and then adjourned
for a long recess. If only Harry Truman
were alive to see it -—- the return of the Do-
Nothing Congress.

ously praised by GOP congressmen and
media pundits in 1995, is now roundly crit-
icized. “Basically, Newt right now is not
even a factor,” one disillusioned Gingrich
supporter gleefully noted. “It’s hke he has
an honorary title. You don’t find
Republicans talking about him. People
aren’t scared of him or trying to impress
him or even feeling sorry for him. It’s just
like he’s not there.”
Some Republicans
are in open rebellion.
Last month, 11
Republicans deliber-
ately defected on a
vote on committee
funding to send their
leadership a message
that they are dissatis-
ﬁed with the progress
that the 105th
Congress has been
making. When one
Republican congress-
man was asked why he openly challenged
the leader of his party, he replied: “Our loy-
alty is to our districts and our principles and
not our party.” A year ago, such open trea-
son would have been totally unthinkable.
Now, the Republicans are busy ﬁght-
ing over the scraps of the 1995 revolution.
As The New Republic article noted, when a
regime begins to collapse, the members of
the inner circle come into conﬂict, arguing
with each other about who led the Chosen
One astray and scheming to succeed their

Newt Gingrich ain't doing anyone any favors by sticking around

now human leader. “In the reign of Newt
Gingrich,” the article declared, “all the
signs are there.” Indeed, Arianna
Huffrngton (the Republican Party’s leading
socialite) recently wrote an article for Roll
Call magazine called ‘The Man Behind
Gingrich’s Fall,” fingering one of
Gingrich’s advisers as the one who messed
everything up by not letting Newt be N ewt
The debate about who led Gingrich astray
(and who is to replace him) is consuming
the Repubhcan caucus.

The Republicans have talked about a
dramatic return to the glory days of 1995
by resuming work on many of the pet pro-
jects they had abandoned last term, but talk
is just talk. The Repubhcans have also
taken a page from President Clinton to try
to make their monarch more likable. One
GOP congressman suggested: “The
American people like upbeat, happy peo-
ple. Even in his darkest moments, Clinton
smiles. All Newt needs to do is smile.”
Smile? The problem is that even when
President Clinton’s popularity was at its
lowest ebb, he was still more popular than
Gingrich. Right now, President Clinton has
a 59-percent approval rating, compared to
Gingrich’s anemic 25 percent. I don’t think
that even Richard Nixon was ever that
unpopular.

Ifl could give Gingrich any advice, I’d
just say this: resign. It’s the only honorable
thing to do.

Michael Berquist thinks it’s time for Newt
to go.

The plan:
  Strike fear
in the
opposition

  

Pitt football s annual Blue-Gold
scrimmage this Saturday marked the
beginning of the Walt Harris era.
While there were no rainbows at the
end of a day filled with intermittent
showers, Harris did introduce some
new wrinkles to the Panther team.

In particular, Saturday marked
two firsts: the first View of Harris’
new West Coast offense to sunny
Pittsburgh and the first view of his
new swarming defense, aptly named
the Mad Dog defense.

These new names sound cute
but, sorry coach, those catchy little
phrases aren’t going to strike fear in
the big, bad Nittany Lions or the
mighty Miami Hurricanes.

Yet there is something new that
Harris can bring to Pitt this year
besides snappy monikers; some-
thing that Pitt has sorely lacked the
last few seasons.

No, it’s not a defense that can

1 keep opponents under 50 points, or

an offense that can at least score
half of that, although those things
would be nice.

What Pitt really needs can be
summed up in one word.

Attitude.

That’s Attitude with a capital
“A,” something that Johnny Majors-
era teams were nearly void of.

While it is, of course, impera-
tive for Harris and his coaching
staff to teach fundamentals, like
proper blocking and tackling, his
biggest accomplishment will be if
he can teach the Panthers confi-
dence.

Welcome to the iungle

Lacrosse team says living together builds unity on playing field

4:.Eric Mosley

 

First there was the time when some
drunken idiot had one too many at a
lacrosse team party and stuck his hand into
a snake cage. That encounter ended in a
bloody mess.

Next came a time when the team
manager accidentally spilled beer on the
ﬂoor and a beer ﬁght ensued.

Then there was the Halloween party
where a combination of players and
friends dressed up in costumes, taped
dozens of Kleenex ghosts to the ceiling,
and then moved the living-room furniture
to create a dance ﬂoor.

This South Oakland house has the
makings of a modem—day Animal House.
Although there are some wild times and
crazy get—togethers, the house has been a
center of unity for the Pitt lacrosse players,
molding them into a winning lacrosse pro-

“Living together has helped us out on
the team,” team co-captain Pat Shea said.
“It works out well, and creates unity on the
team.”

The house is called home by six
lacrosse players, three alligators, and a
Colombian red-tail boa constrictor.
Seniors Pat Shea and Marc Polecritti,
junior Dave Travis, sophomores Pete Choi
and Steve love, and freshman Brian
Pasquini have lived in the house the past
year. At game time, these guys could be

 

considered animals themselves, due to the
nasty aspect of the game. They compete in
a brutal sport, and each of them has
enough scars to rival a patchwork quilt.

It all. began back in high school for
ﬁve of the players who live in the house.
Shea, Travis, and Pasquini went to nearby
Upper Saint Clair High, and Polecritti and
Love went to North Allegheny High.

The two schools are rivals, and ironi-
cally, their lacrosse teams met in the
league championship. North Allegheny
won, so bragging rights
belong to Polecritti and
Love.

“On a personal note,
they all hated me from
Upper St. Clair,” said
Polecritti, who now
coaches at NA. “We were
rival schools, and they
would get mad when I
scored on them all of the
time.”

Choi, on the other
hand, moved to Pittsburgh from
Philadelphia to attend Pitt. He learned
about the team when he saw a lacrosse
player with his equipment.

“I asked him how I could get involved
with the team, and I was told to sign up at
an activities table in the William Pitt
Union,” Choi said. “I signed up and I
began playing.”

The idea for the six to live together
came about last year at a practice.

  

 

Tuesday, April ‘I 5, ‘I997

“We all thought it would be cool to
get a house and I thought it would be cool
to have a house with all lacrosse players,”
Shea said.

They moved in and haven’t looked
back since.

“Last year, Pat had an apartment,”
said Travis, who is majoring in religion
and anthropology. “It wasn’t like the
lacrosse house now, but he would throw a
party after a big lacrosse game, and we all
would go over.”

Although most of the
guys had partied together
and knew each other’s
personal habits before
moving in, they were not
aware of Polecritti’s love
of reptiles. He is known
by his roommates as the
Reptile Man. He owns
and has named each of
the reptiles in the house.

“The snake is named
Anican, after Anican
Skywalker. The alligators are named
Cypress, Trixie, and Myron, for Steeler
commentator Myron Cope,” he said.

“His kids will one day have pretty
funny names,” said the 21-year-old Shea
with a chuckle.

“We didn’t ﬁnd out about the reptiles
until this year,” Travis said. “But everyone
is cool with it. There is no problem at all.”
“It’s pretty crazy with the reptiles

Smith 8: company on the right track at Duke

H Moak

 

The Pitt men’s and women’s track
teams came home from last weekend’s
Duke Relays with their shoes still wet, but
their spirits were undampened.

“Put it on the record —— We had a
great day,” said Head Coach Steve Lewis,
smiling broadly.

The weather in Durham, N.C., last
weekend was as bad as it was in the rest
of the country, which made for less-than-
optirnal conditions for a track meet. At
Monday afternoon’s practice, several ath-
letes still had wet shoes. An even bigger
obstacle than the weather was the compe-
tition.

“Certain areas were stronger than
others,” Lewis said. “Between 400 and
10,000 meters, the competition was
tougher than what we’ ve faced.”

Two of the day’s top performances
for the Panthers came from those events.
Angie Martin set a new school record in
the 800 meters with a time of 2:05.56,
solidifying her position as one of the
nation's elite half-milers.

 

Martin was the leader of a pack of
strong racers in the 800 meters.

“All of our half-milers ran well,”
Lewis said. “They got close enough to get
a good smell of the top.”

For the women, after Martin, there
were Chantee Earl, Anna Kohler, and
Tamika Dorin, all with times under
2215.5. The men’s 800 meters was one of
the most closely contested races of the
day. The top 35 runners were all within
7.2 seconds of each other. In the middle of
that pack came Pitt’s Carl Taylor, Rich
Walsh, and Scott Gilpen, all with times of
1153.6.

The top Pitt distance performance of
the day, and probably of the season so far,
came from Stephanie Ellsworth in the
10,0()0 meters. Ellsworth ﬁnished third
with a time of 36:38.03, qualifying her for
the ECAC regional championships in the
event. This comes from a runner who
never broke the 40-minute mark last sea-
son.

Still, what Coach Lewis said “might
have been the best performance of the
day” was Jack Jeffreys’ 110-meter hurdle
race. What shows up in the ofﬁcial results

is that Jeflreys ran a 14.49, being beaten
only by former Olympic qualiﬁer Steve
Brown, who is now out of college. What
doesn’t show up is the even more
astounding 14.29 he ran in his trial heat.
“In the trials, he just annihilated the

ﬁeld,” Lewis said. “He ran a 14.29 in the 

rain, and he beat some really good guys.”

Trecia Smith led the way in the ﬁeld
events. She was second in the high jump
with 5-4 1/4, and she tied the school

record with a triple jump of 44—feet-9. . -

That mark also qualiﬁes her for the

NCAA championship meet in the triple .

jump-

regional championship meets with their
performances at Duke. Shana Fadis did it

in the 400-meter hurdles with a time of 1

1:01.45. Jennifer Williams qualiﬁed in the
100-meter hurdles by running a 14.48.
Ron Losiewicz’s sixth-place throw of
151-feet-ll in the discus earned him a
shot at the postseason.

The Boston College Eagles
baseball team took two of three
games this weekend at Trees Field
from the Pitt Panthers.

Yesterday afternoon’s game was
the best of the three, with the Eagles
squeaking by 9-6.

BC ’s center fielder, Mike Quirk,
finished 4-5 with one RBI and two
runs scored. Both Sean McGowan
and‘Chang Choe drove in three in
the Eagles’ victory.

Steve Dickinson had a mon-
strous five-RBI game, which includ-
ed a grand slam to tie the game.

Pitt used six pitchers in the
game, but Rob Schaffer dropped to
1-2 after pitching 2/3 of an inning.
BC’s Steve Dunlea got the win and
Brendan Nolan got the save, each
with one inning of work.

Pitt took a 1-0 lead in the sev-
enth inning before BC fought back
to make it 5-1 going into the bottom
of the ninth.

Rob Garvey and Sam Crowley
both singled to bring up Chris
Delsignore as a pinch hitter. He
bunted for a single and loaded the
bases for Dickinson.

Dickinson stepped up and blast-
ed a grand slam to tie the game at
five and put Pitt in a prime position
to win the game after the big come-
back. A
The Eagles scored in the top of
the 10th and thought they had the
game put away when Scott Lobaugh
singled to get things going again for
the home team. He was caught steal-
ing on the next pitch.

On the pitch after that, Crawley
hit a bomb to tie the game. Had
Lobaugh not been thrown out, the
Panthers would have had the win

instead of having to go to the 11th.

In the 11th, the Panthers used
three pitchers, but the damage was
done when Kevin Lazeski gave up
the first run. The Eagles scored
three more, and Nolan held the
Panthers scoreless in the bottom of
the inning for the 9-6 win.

Chad Meade said, “We showed a
lot of guts but just couldn’t pull it
off in the end.”

Pitt was supposed to play this
game as part of a Saturday double-
header which was rained out.
Instead, they played a double—head-
er Sunday and one Monday to com-
plete the series.

Pitt won the first game Saturday
2-0. Chris Gallick got the complete-
game win. Mike Isaac led the team
with two hits, while Louis Melucci
got the lone RBI.

The Panthers scored their first
run in the bottom of the first.
Lobaugh singled and stole second.
He advanced to third on an error by
the second baseman. Lobaugh fin-
ished the inning by stealing home.

Pitt scored its other run in the
bottom of the fifth on Isaac’s RBI,
which drove in Crowley.

Boston College ‘took the second
game on Saturday 5-4. Eric took the
loss for the Panthers after giving up
four runs in two innings.

Pitt scored in the first as
Lobaugh singled in Jason Workman,
who had doubled.

BC answered in the second with
four hits and four runs as Pitt also
made one error.

The Eagles added one more in
the third to take a 5-1 lead. Pitt
scored one in the eighth and two in
the ninth but could not come all the
way back for the win.

After this weekend, ‘the Panthers
dropped to 16-17 on the season.

a lot of fun. We all get along, and we’re
very respectful of each
other.”

“They [the reptiles]
are deﬁnitely a conversa-
tion piece,” said Pasquini,
who is majoring in statis-
tics and computer science.

The house has just
experienced a “bad week
with the reptiles” due to
the recent death of their
iguana, Atticus. V

Despite all of the rep-
tiles, the house could eas-

“I usually despise frat houses because
of all of the political hodgepodge,” said
Polecritti, who is majoring in biology and
anthropology. “However, it is a frat house
with no dues and no hazing. It’s all friend-

Roommate and teammate Pete Choi
agrees: “We are congregated here for a
more genuine reason than fratemities. It’s a
unity of men, and our focus is on lacrosse.”

The front of the house bears a sign
made by the players which reads “LAX,”
which is the universal abbreviation for
lacrosse. According to the guys, it is their
sign of team unity. The house also has nine
bedrooms, two kitchens, a weight room,

 The living room on the

 The sign on the front of

a lacrosse player on the second ﬂoor’s liv-

Between schoolwork, the duties of a
big house, and a focus on lacrosse, they
don’t have much time for social activities.

“The lacrosse parties are what we pret-
ty much do for fun,” said Polecritti, 21.
“We don’t go out much. For a while there,
we were having a party every other week-
end.”

The parties, though, are not just limit-
ed to lacrosse players.

“They were originally parties for
lacrosse players, but they could bring any-
one they wanted to,” Polecritti said. “It just
turned out to be just a huge hodgepodge of
people. Even the coach has been to some of

the parties.”

in the living room, in the kitchen, and out
on the decks.”

At one of the parties held at the house
in the fall, somebody for some reason
decided to bring a pair of hair clippers.
Freshman Ed Murphy was the first target.

“We picked him up and dragged him
outside, while he was kicking and scream-
ing, but with one pass his head was
shaved,” Travis, 21, recalls. “Once about
ﬁve guys were shaved, the rest of us decid-
ed to shave them [heads] also.”

The Halloween and St. Patrick’s Day
parties have also been pretty memorable for
the guys, especially because of the green
beer.

However, some of the parties have
been small because of the house’s distance
from the campus.

“It’s sometimes hard
to have big parties
because people don’t
want to stay late because
it is oﬂ° campus and it is a
somewhat shady neigh-
borhood,” Travis said.

Despite the distance

The ﬁeld he is referring to is Dan
Marino Field, which is located across the
street from their house. Whenever the
mood strikes the players, they will go over
and shoot around. -

“Little kids in the neighborhood get a
kick out of us playing on the ﬁeld,” Choi
said. “Sometimes they work up the courage
to come over and try it.”

Like many students at Pitt, some of
their neighbors don’t understand the game
of lacrosse.

“One time one of our neighbors want-
ed to talk to one of us, and he said, ‘Get the
one who was over there playing that game
with that funny stick,’” Polecritti noted.

Lacrosse is not a well-known sport in
western Pennsylvania, but according to
Choi it is one of the biggest sports on the
eastern seaboard.

“Out east, lacrosse is a varsity sport
like football and basket-
ball,” he said. “When I
moved out here, I could-
n’t believe that these guys
had to buy their own
equipment. Lacrosse
around here is dilferent,
and even last year, when I
would walk to practice,

from the campus, they people would stare at my
feel they got a steal when stuff and not know what it
moving into the house. i was.”

“For being so far
away from campus, it is a
pretty convenient place,”
Polecritti said. “We have a parking area out
back, and the ﬁeld is lit until 1:00 am. to
practice on.”

 

It is a game similar to
hockey, but there are
many diiferences, such as
more scoring and less dirty play.

“I love lacrosse because it is diﬂerent,”

Pilt rugby shows its claws in Ohio

Panthers take third at tournament over weekend

Patrick Robertson

 

The men’s rugby team finished
third in the university division of the
Ohio Classic Tournament this week-
end in Columbus, Ohio.

There were about 80 teams in
the tournament divided into five
brackets. About 30 of these teams
were of the college or university
level.

Pitt opened the tournament with
a grueling game against the
University of Dayton Flyers. It was
pouring and sloppy at the beginning
of play. The poor field conditions
contributed to the low score.

Sean Tonkin opened the scoring
for the Panthers with an early penal-
ty kick to give his team a 3-0 lead.

Just after this, the Flyers
answered with a try, and the
Panthers suffered an even bigger
blow as Dave Misiloek was lost for

at least the rest of the tournament

with a torn ligament in his knee.

The Panthers had two chances to
win the game in the second half.
Both came on penalty kicks. They
missed the first but made the second
to nail down the 6-5 win.

The second game matched Pitt
against Ohio University. The
Panthers got their first try from an
unlikely source, Brendan
Cummings. This was his first career
try to put them ahead 5-0, but short-
ly thereafter, the Bobcats tied the
game at five with a try of their own.

Ohio University was up 14-10
late in the second half when Sean
Tonkin beat the final buzzer with a
try to win the game 15-14.

Rob Mailliard set up this play
with a beautiful indi-
vidual effort. He
mowed over a couple
of opponents and then
made a behind—the—
back pass to Tonkin,
who came right off his
shoulder and slipped
into the try zone for the
win.
This win ended the
Panthers’ work for
Saturday and set them
up for a game against a very talent-
ed Ohio State team in the semifinals.

During the course of the first
two games, Pitt lost five key players
to injury. Rookies who had played in
only three or four games had to step

 

in for the next game.

Ohio State came out storming
and beat Pitt 50-5. The Buckeyes
dominated all aspects of the game.
The Panthers could not do anything
to blunt the Buckeyes’ potent
offense, nor could they penetrate
their smothering defense.

Pitt was set for a matchup for
third place with Ohio University, but
the powers that be decided that
because the Panthers had already
beaten the Bobcats they were enti-
tled to third place.

After the tournament.

Coach Dan Talbert
said, “I am very happy
with the way our rook-
ies played.”

Tonkin added, “The
inexperienced guys
stepped in and did a
great job.”

Pitt only has one

game left, and that is
the alumni game on
April 19. Talbert has made a bold
prediction, saying, “Us alumni will
beat the snot out of them.” After this
declaration, everyone should go out
and see what the team’s response
will be.

Gopher digs himself a hole in
The Pih‘ News Sports Briefing

F mm local and wire services

Football

- The Denver Broncos landed one of the
NFL’s top defensive players in defensive end
Neil Smith. The 1-800—Collect star spent the
ﬁrst nine years of his career in Kansas City
after being the second overall pick in the
1988 NFL draft.

Last week Smith met with Chiefs Head
Coach Marty Schottenheirner and was
told that Kansas City didn’t have enough
room under the salary cap to re-sign him.

0 The San Diego Chargers made an
attempt to get back to the Super Bowl by
signing free—agent defensive end William
Fuller.

Talks between Fuller and his fomier
team, the Philadelphia Eagles, broke down
last week. Fuller spent three seasons in
Philadelphia after breaking into the league
with the Houston Oilers.

0 The New York Post announced that
roughly 10 percent of the NFL’s 1,500 play-
ers are addicted to 

Anonymous players told the Post that
there are players who have gone as far as
trading game tickets for painkillers when
their teams limit their prescriptions. This
would be a violation of the Controlled
Substances Act and is punishable by law.

Last year, Green Bay quarterback Brett
Favre went public with his addiction and
spent time in rehab.

Retired quarterback Jim Kelly scolfed
at the players’ use of medication.

“The game is played with pain. If you
can’t play in pain, you should be playing

golf, like I’m doing a lot now.”
Soccer

-The Major League of Soccer
armounced that Columbus, Ohio, will host
the 2000 championship and the 200] All-
Star Game. These events are contingent on
the passage of a bill in Franklin that will raise
sales taxes by one—half cent to fund the con-
struction of a 35,000—seat stadium for the
Columbus Crew and a 20,000—seat arena for
a potential NHL expansion team.

Baseball

0 New York Yankee pitcher Dwight
Gooden will undergo surgery for a hernia
and will miss anywhere between one to
three months.

Gooden complained of lower-back pain
after his April 5 start in Oakland. Gooden
gave up ﬁve nms on six hits in 5 2/3 innings
of work
Basketball

- Minnesota Gopher guard Courtney
James pleaded innocent to a domestic-
assault charge after he was charged with hit-
ting his girlfriend with a telephone book and
throwing her to the ﬂoor. The sophomore is
suspendedfremtheteamuntilthecaseis set-
tled He is due to appear in court on May 14.
Temris ’

0 Boris Becker is back in tournament
play following a two-month layoff. Becker
slipped to 11th in the world rankings after
suffering a wrist injury. He lost a doubles
match in the Japan Open yesterday but did
manage two 116-mile—per-hour serves.

The three-tirne Wimbledon champion
resumes play today against Canadian
Sebastien Lareau.

Lacrosse 

Polecritti said. “It is the best combination of
sports. It is fast, active, and hard hitting. It’s
got everything.”

“In hockey; there is elbowing and
holding,” Travis said. “But in lacrosse, we
are gentlemen. We don’t play dirty.”

Many people might argue with their
calling themselves gentlemen, especially
some of the opponents they have crushed
this season.

They finished the season with a 9-4
record and are focused on the playoffs,
which begin on Saturday night.

However, after they graduate from Pitt,
they ﬁgure they will get jobs associated
with each of their respective majors and
continue to play lacrosse in local men’s
leagues.

The six players living in the house
have had few roommate problems.

“I was surprised that we didn’t have a
lot of conﬂicts that come with roommates,”
Pasquini,  “It has been pretty laid
back.”

“'Ihe only ﬁghts we have had are
roorrnnate ﬁghts, like stop eating my
bread,” Shea said.

 

“It’s a shame we couldn’t have an even
bigger house for everyone on the team,
because no one would miss practice,”
Polecritti said. “\V1th a bigger house, our
team organization would be better.”

The main problem with the house is
that nine people are needed for the lease,
and reaching that number has been a prob-
lem from the start. \V1th the end of season
in sight, the guys look forward to next year,
but unfortunately for the lacrosse team, the
lacrosse house’s residents will be split up.

“It is unfortimate that next year we are
splitting up,” Polecritti said. “This year, if
there was a question about the team, call
the lacrosse house. If there was a party, it
would automatically be here. Next year
will be a disappointment.”

When the year ends, the six men who
have lived and partied in the house known
as the lacrosse house will head in their own
directions, and the “LAX” sign on the front
of the house will be taken down.

This will end a year of fun and close
friendship. Only time will tell, however, if
this marks the end of the team unity that the
sign stands for.
