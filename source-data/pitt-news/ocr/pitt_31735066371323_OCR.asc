The use of animals in experimen-
tal research procedures has stirred
heated debate across the country,
and much of that attention has been
focused on university-run facilities.

Universities’ have been vandal-
ized, broken into for the purpose of
“liberating” the animals housed
there. The research being conducted
has also been the object of pickets
and challenges. .

Although far from the center of
the storm, the University of Pitts-
burgh has become the interest of the
local chapter of Mobilization for
Animals, a nationwide group con-
cerned about animal rights.

Dan Kinney, co-chairman of the
local chapter of Mobilization for
Animals, said that he has been trying
to make an appointment to tour
animal research facilities at Pitt.

President Reagan and religious groups are fight-
ing to put forced prayer back in public schools.

  

~ Kinney’s group is also planning a"
candlelight vigil in April to call
attention to the cause of animal
rights.

Last week, the Pittsburgh chapter
of the group ran an ad in The Pitt
News asking for information on
animal abuse in the area. It received
no replies concerning Pitt, Kinney
said. ' .

cal research involving animal sub-

not conduct drug and cosmetic test-
ing, which are often attacked by
animal rights groups, said Paul
Bramson, D.V.M., director of Pitt’s
department of laboratory and
animal resources.

The question of experimental
animal care touches on such aspects
of biomedical research as funding,
animal procurement and, most
importantly, on the experimental
process itself. Also taken into con-
sideration is the care given to the

animal during its stay at a university.
Over 90 percent ofall experiments
performed at Pitt are done with
rodents, but dogs, cats, sheep, pigs
and monkeys are also used. All of
these animals are purchased from
professional breeders or livestock
owners. (Pennsylvania and five
other states forbid the sale of
impounded animals to research
labs.) These animals range in price
from $3 per rodent to as much as
$1,000 for. a non—human primate.
The requirements of the experi-
ment result in a variety of experi-
mental procedures, but the emphasis
is the same in all cases —- to provide
humane treatment and care and to
alleviate pain during the process.
Bramson pointed out that neither
humans nor animals are given a_ pain
killing injection before an inocula-
tion, but those animals undergoing
invasive surgery for the purpose of
research into bodily functions are
fully anesthetized with a pain killer.

SGB member:
pro-life group
misused funds

By Kathy Casey
And Colette Ferris
The Pitt News

Student Government Board
member Avery Abrams thinks that
the Students for Life organization, a
pro-life student group, has been mis-
using funds allocated for Pitt News
advertisements.

“Using ads for ideological mes-
sages is a clear violation of alloca- ~
tions," Abrams said at the board’s
weekly meeting last night.

Abrams was out of order Alloca-
tions Chairman Steve Smith said
after last night’s meeting.

“It was wrong for Avery to speak
out like that. There are other ways to
address, this matter,” Smith said;

Smith said that it is the role of
Allocations to decide if there is a
misuse of funds. He said that
Abrams had failed to give the repre-
sentative from Students for Life due
process. Smith suggested to Abrams
that a written complaint be for-
warded to the Allocations Commit-
tee and that, if warranted, a hearing ,
would be held to decide the matter.

“If it was the duty of Allocations
and it was an oversight, someone has
to take the responsibility and follow
up on this kind of violation,”
Abrams said. '

Abrams attempted to’ draw a
parallel between the Students for
-Life group and the Progressive Stu-
dent Network, which currently has
its assets frozen after similar prob-
lems with use of funds for

explained. Bramson said thatyhis
department charges individual
researchers for the services pro-
vided. The researcher, in turn, finan-
ces his project with grant money
from such non-profit sources as the
National Institute of Health, other
federal agencies and organizations

like the American Cancer
Association.

According to Bramson, 99 per-
cent. of all biomedical research

grants come from these and other
sources. Grants are authorizedafter -
a review of the procedure proposed.
The investigator must also submit
his proposal to the related university
department and receive its permis-
sion. This two-fold ‘ process is

Japanese militaation unlikely

By Bob Steen
The Pitt News

When Chinese and Korean offi-
cials discovered last year that Japa-
nese .educators were rewriting
history texts to cast Japan’s inva-
sions of the two countries in a more
favorable light, some observers
feared a revival of Japanese
militarism.

Such a revival, however, is
unlikely to happen. according to his-

,torian G. Cameron Hurst ofthe Uni-

versity of Kansas. “The textbook
issue is not indicative of any massive
right—wing movement on Japan's
part,” Hurst said Wednesday in a
Graduate School of Public and
International Affairs colloquim.

“My gut reaction from having
been in East Asia recently is that
Japan is not likely to be particularly
expansionistic in defense policy,” he
said. “The Japanese are not eager to
do so, even though [Prime Minister]
Nakasone has promised to do that."

Nakasone has appeared more

‘ responsive to U.S. demands for

hikes in defense spending than did
former prime ministers, Hurst said,
but this does not necessarily signal a
risegin militaristic nationalism.

Some believe that rearmament in
Japan could trigger a move to the far
right in politics and public opinion.
Hurst called this the "scratch a Japa-
nese, get a Samurai syndrome,"
which he illustated by citing a recent
editorial that appeared in the Los
Angeles Time, Feb. 23.

He quoted the following passage:
“The Samurai tradition is deeply
entrenched in Japanese culture. Any
tourist can find that out simply by
turning on the television set in his
hotel room.”

Hurst, a specialist in medieval
Japan, said herfinds this point of
view invalid and racist. He attrib-

uted the fear of reversion to a “might
is right” attitude to hard-dying
memories of World War II and the
‘nilitarism of imperial Japan.
Though most Americans have
never watched a Samurai television
drama, many have heard of the con-
troversial rewriting of textbook
chapters dealing with Japan’s mil-
itary activities in East Asia, Hurst
said.
Hurst called this issue “a real red

herring.” While he acknowledged,

that “the Japanese have tried to play
down some of their militaristic ven-
tures in Asia," he pointed out that
school boards in the U.S. also use
textbooks for political reasons. The
Japanese Education Ministry
simply attracts more criticism of
censorship than American school
boards because it is centralized, he
explained.

I Hurst cited an opinion poll»in
which “only l6.3 percent of young
Japanese expressed a willingness to
sacrifice their personal life for the

state." The same poll showed a more .

nationalistic stance in the majority
of older Japanese.

One member of the audience, a
Chinese man, vehemently objected
to Hurst’s remarks about the text-
book issue, claiming that he was
attempting to “whitewash” the Edu-
cation Ministry's effort to “beautify
the image of Japan in China."

When Harvard, that cornerstone
of American education, is menti-
oned, one usually thinks of prestige,
of honor, of excellence. Yet in 1869
and 1870, Harvard’s law school was
termed decadent and an administra-
tive mess. Oliver Wendell Homes,
Jr., in the American Law Review,
even stated that the law school at
Harvard was a disgrace to the Com-
,m.onwealt_h of Massachgusetts. ‘

Today, the Harvard School of '
‘ Law is a prestigious and academi-_

cally sound institution. What hap-
pened after the harsh criticisms of
1870 not only raised the school to
the tradition of excellence it now

A enjoys but also affected the way law

asa profession has been taught.

Disagreement

advertising.

The Progressive Student Net-
work's charter was revoked because
money allocated for recruitment ads
was used for something else, accord-
ing to Abrams.

Abrams said that the issue did not
nor should not involve his own
ideologies or the ideologies of the
various board members. Abrams
said that due process did not come
into play because the action of the
Student for Life group was a “blat-
ant violation of allocation
procedures.”

The board voted 7-1, Bob Kramer
dissenting, to send the group’s
budget back to the Allocations
Committee for further consider-
ation.

The board also voted to send the V

budgets of the Heinz Chapel Choir,
Pitt Hillel Club and the Pitt Out-
doors Club back to Allocations for
reconsideration.

The Hillel group requested $6,871
for a cultural program, which Smith
said was-too high of a price tag for
such an event. A similar argument
occurred at last week‘s meeting over
a budget request by the Black Action
Society.

Smith said that the request by the

Heinz Chapel Choir for $1612.50 to

go to its annual choir camp repres-
ented a dangerous precedent if
passed and that the board needed to
remain consistent in its handling of
similar requests by other groups.
Smith said that the nine largest
student groups, known as the High-
9, have taken up 59.3 percent of the
board’s $300,000 budget and that 75
organizations still needed
budgeting. -

Bill LaPiana, assistant professor
of law at Pitt’s law school, discussed
the importance of the changes made
at Harvard in a lecture Wednesday
for the history departments Bag
Lunch Series.

LaPiana, who earned his B.A.,
M.A. and JD. (law) degrees at Har-
vard. is currently working on his
Ph.D. thesis, also from Harvard.
His research topic is the origin of the
modern American law school and
specifically the development of the
case-study method in legal
education.

desperate need of reform in 1870,
explained LaPiana, when the. uni-
versity‘s president, Charles Elliott,
appointed Christopher Columbus
Langdell to “tighten up" the disas-
trous administration of the school.

But Langdell was not one for
extensive reorganizing, according to

LaPiana, who noted that Langdell’s
structural reformation included a
rail built between the reading room
and the stacks in the library to pro-
hibit students from crossing over
into the stacks.

LaPiana said Langdell’s real con-
tribution to the Harvard School of
Law and, more importantly, to the
legal education field was his method
of teaching. “What he taught, in sub-
stance was not innovative" he said,
but it was “enormously practical."

Langdell used the case-study

method of teaching, which differs_
from the tratlitional-.lec'ture style. -

LaPiana explained that before

Langdellfs, method,‘ students were‘

required to read books that would
“show them what the law was about”
and books on “forms of actions.”

The classroom activity consisted of ,

lecture, “This is what the law is...,”
and “collegiate recitation"; that is.

“Spit the textbook back at — [the
professor],” La Piana said.

The case-study method requires
students to read court cases on their
own and to draw out the principles
by themselves. The class time
includes lectures but, more impor-
tantly, said LaPiana, involves “an
essential part of learning — a moral

imperative —- discussion by the
students.“
According to LaPiana, what

Langdell did for the first time was
make “law study , through the case-
study method, difficult!” The new
way required ‘persistence, hard work
and a real understanding of what
-was being studied on the part of the
student, he said.

LaPiana cited a nickname given
to Langdell by his students that cap-
tured the role of the case-study pro-

fessor “Red—haired son of a

bitch." According to LaPiana, “The

rigor of the case-study method
would become the common denomi-
nator of their [law professors] pro-
fession.”

Behind Langdell’s new system was
a desire to make the law profession
worthy of pursuit, explained LaPi-

ana, and thus Langdell inadvert-'

ently became a herald of the “new
age." Law schools set higher
entrance standards, and legal studies
programs grew more and more diffi-~
cult, weeding out the students who
just couldn‘t handle it, he said. -
LaPiana stated that Langdell
wanted to provide “for an earnest

. bunch of men...a profession that will

give them‘ a spec_ial skill, that will
separate them from everyone else.”
Langdell wanted “to give thema real
profession.”

Looking toward the future, LaPi-
ana said, “the case-study method is
so well entrenched” that .“it will
flourish.”

A View from Abroad/ Deborah Sarbin

One pleasure of traveling is savor-
ing the experience after your return.
One year ago, I was reading bro-

Travel is the greatest education you can get

‘ii-Jchures about French study pro-

grams and hoping to receive a
Nationality Room Scholarship.
Now, I can look back on the six
weeks I spent studying language and
literature in Avignon and a week in
Paris with a measure ofdetachment.

Now, with a more even-handed
attitude, I can still whole-heartedly
recommend that if you ever get the
opportunity to travel out of the
country, go. Go, go, go. -It’s an edu-
cation you could never get in the

. classroom.

I left the States last summer with
preconceptions of the French that
were often off the mark. But unex-
pectedly, I discovered a sense of fel-
lowship with other travelers that I
never anticipated.

It’s easy, attending a local SCl‘l( )1,
to develop provincial attitudes. ‘If
you’ve never been away froi»: the
concerns and values of your region,
you often generalize from them,

assuming that these hometown atti- g

tudes are universal.

There are universals. The French,
too, complain about politics, inﬂa-
tion and the weather. Expecting to
meet sophisticated French families,
I lived instead with a retired,
working-class family that took in
American students to supplement
their income. Convinced that the
average Frenchman was among the

most well-read and culturally sensi-
tive in the world, I was surprised to
see scores of French-language
Harlequin romances.

But much more significant are the _« ’
differences. It's initially intimidating _

to leave home for two months and to

' live among people who don’t share

your language, your history and
your culture. But at the same time,
there‘s satisfaction in knowing that
you're fighting the kind of paroch-
ialism that created the famous New
Yorker map.

With the distance comes an
opportunity ‘to see your home more
objectively, as a European visitor
might. What struck me most in my
first weeks in Avignon were the nar-
rowness of the streets and sidewalks,
thecompactness and careful special-
ization of each shop and, of course,
the medieval wall around the city.
Everything is close, orderly, well-
defined — a reflection, I think, of the
French mind and character, a far cry
from the urban sprawl of American
cities. ’

Paris provided the textbook con-
trast between provincial and cosmo-
politan life. There, medieval
remnants like the Cluny Museum
coexist with the newest fashions
from Dior and Chanel. Paris is a city
of immigrants, where you‘re just as
likely to meet a Moroccan, a Greek
or a Vietnamese as you are a French-
man. This is even more apparent in
August, when almost all of the Pari-

sians leave the city for vacation and
indulge .in slow-paced provincial
life. . '

A disadvantage is that tourists
flood the city then. I encounter such
boorish American tourists as those
who would bringtheir own salad
dressing to French restaurants and
“culturally inquisitive" youths. who
set aside an hour to visit the Louvre
in order to see “the Mona Lisa and
junk like that.”

Ironically, as a foreigner,,I often
felt a greater sense of belonging that

I have at home. Some of my fondest,
memories are of breakfasts with stu- ‘

dents from Switzerland, Germany,
Spain and England, at a six-dollar-
per-night hotel where I stayed in the
Latin Quarter of Paris. The estab-
lishment is part of a French travel

bureau scheme to provide low-cost
accommodations for young
travelers.

F

l‘d turn down any four-star Pari-
sian hotel to stay there again. True,‘I
had to climb six flights of winding
staircases daily, and the'accommo-

dations, were, in a word, Spartan.

At breakfast, we'd line up in the din- ‘

ing room to take a bowl that would
be filled with cafe au lait by a kitchen
worker. We would then file to the
long wooden tables and benches. ,

‘ The scene reminded me of some-

-thing from a 19th-century poor-

house; I felt like one of the orphans
in "Oliver Twist," half expecting
someone to utter, “Please, sir, I want
some more."

V There was a strong sense of fel-
lowship during those meals that
simply can't be duplicated in the
Towers cafeteria. We were diverse
people — all nationalities; some
workers, some students —— all with a
common interest. As we shared a
continental breakfast of fresh bread
from the bakery next door, we also

' shared each others’ impressions of

Paris, advice from earlier trips and

memories of the early summer.

To sum‘ up my experience, which
is a task that can be achieved neither
simply nor neatly, probably . the
greatest advantage of study and
travel abroad is that it affords the
opportunity to dispense with‘super-
ficialities, the clutter of daily life and
to see into the heart of other cul-
tures, other people. '

Somewhere in Oakland/ William Pierce

Religion responsibility of home not school

As the election gears up, the issues
of special interest groups come to
Ronald Reagan was
elected with strong support from the
very right wing of America. Once
again, as the election nears, they are
pushing for Reagan to bring forth
one of their pet projects, prayer in
public schools. ‘

This issue has been in the public
eye for some time. The time has
come to put this issue to rest. The

Constitution of the United States-

clearly establishes what many call
the “law of the land," the separation
of church and state. Public schools
are an arm of the state because they
are supported by public tax dollars.
The church, or religion, is a private

 

institution ' supported by private
solicitations‘.

Currently, legislation is being
brought before the Senate and
House to consider prayer in school.
By this, interest groups mean organ-
ized prayer in school. We've all seen
the bumper stickers saying that kids
need to pray. Granted, this may be
true- But three points need to be
considered.

First, isn’t that what church is for?
A place for organized prayer accord-
ing to one’s own beliefs? That’s what
they tell/us in church!

Second, children can pray any-
time they want to in school, between
classes, during lunch, before school,
after school or before tests (Dear

God, get me through this one).
Prayer is a private time and needs no
organization to be useful or ofvalue.
Therefore, on this count, there is no
need for organized school prayer. Or
even to disguise it as a moment of
silent meditation. . _
The third point is more important
and goes right to the core of the
debate. Prayer or religious training
and study are a matter best handled
by the church itself and the family.
Many people say the family is losing

its importance in the United States. a

One reason that often has been
cited is that other outside groups are

’usurping the role of the family.

Some have even cited the schools as
contributing to this decline in family

life. Many say that teachers have
become a greater influence on stu-
dents than their parents are. By
allowing schools the right of organ-
ized prayer, another role of the fam-
ily is being‘ taken away - religious
training.

Don’t let your kids be trained by
someone else in something so per-
sonal as /religion. Belief and faith are
two sensitive and volatile emotions
that cannot be dealt with on the
mass scale school presents. So, par-
ents, be more responsible to your
kids; don’t let others teach your own
children morals, beliefor faith. Take
the right that is yours and teach your
own children.

This issue is more important than

the question of whether or not
prayer in school is legal or illegal. It’s
morally irresponsible to let others
influence your own children into
believing in a God or not or believ-
ing in Christianity or not. Fight
back. Take what is yours!! V
And, Ronald Reagan, listen to
what you preach. You’ve said time
and time again that the family is in
decline and needs to be rebuilt in
America. So let parents teach their
own children about religion and
prayer. It's their right, not yours!

INo cable TV in dorms

By Dolores Rice
The Pitt News

Pitt students who savor the idea
of watching cable television in their
dorm rooms late into the night will
have to wait, despite Student
Government Board member Avery

Abrams’ self-created “Coalition for
Cable TV."

Abrams would not comment on
the work he has done on the cable
issue since his election‘, but he has
contacted Assitant Provost Ray
Steele's office to arrange meetings,
according to the Provost's Office.

Steele said he has been in negotia-
tions with Warner Cable Company
since 1978.

“Its a very complicated issue,‘
Steele said.

He said Pitt is not in a financial
position to consider installing cable
at this time. Pitt's size alone would
make wiring the campus both diffi-
cult and expensive, Steele said.

Warner Cable’s Public Relations
Director Evan Pattack‘ agreed that

installation would be complicated
and added that there would also be
problems with program dis-
tribution. .

Warner and Pitt would have to
determine the proper program pack-
ages, Pattack explained, because
Warner would be serving a campus
rather than individual homes. Some
packages may be fine for faculty
lounges but not for dormitory
lounges, he said.

Steele said he has not abandoned
the request for cable television. He
said that after completion of the
“Campus of the Future” project,
which will bring a state-of-the-art

’ supports

 

fiber optics communication network
to Pitt, cable could be more easil
installed. ‘

Donovan Hughes, Pitt's director
of housing, said he strongly opposes
individual dormitory rooms’ receiv-
ing cable television.

Hughes said that there are already
enough distractions to keep students
from their studying and that cable
would only add to that problem. He
also said that absenteeism might
also increase.

Pitt junior Lanell Anderson, who
cable television in the
dorms, said, “The cable must be
hooked up in the rooms; the lounges
would get too crowded and noisy.“

Students do career research

By Dan Bates
The Pitt News

Pitt’s Career Counseling Center is
giving writing students the oppor-
tunity to research careers and use

‘those results to help other students

plan their futures.

Writing adviser and part-time
instructor Fiore Pugliano asks stu-
dents enrolled in his “Written Pro-
fessional Communication" classes
to research assigned careers and
gather information for the center.
Each student must conduct an inter-
view with an established profes-
sional in the assigned field. Students
compile data from research and
interviews into a written report for
Teddy Fakles, the head of the

project.

The student project idea evolved
several years ago, when Pugliano
began looking for ways to give his
students professional work and
experience. “I wanted to get students
out of the mold of the traditional
classroom," he said.

lt has been very difficult to give
students contact with the real busi-
ness world, he added. “The project
gives the students a good opportun-
ity to do professional writing. If the
report is good, we use it,“ Fakles
said.

informational handouts and file
entries in the library. Several stu-
dents may be asked to do later pro-
jects for the center or help with Pitt’s
annual career seminar, where stu-
dents can informally discuss career
options with established
professionals.

The counseling center, located on
the third floor of the William Pitt
Union, offers a career development
program, which focuses on students
who desire assistance in planning
careers.

“We help students with general
career development, which is one of
the main reasons for attending col-
lege," Fakles said. “The center facili-
tates ways for students to gain
valuable information and success
stories about careers.“ ~

Writing student Geri Gleeson said
she has found Pugliano‘s class chal-

lenging and exciting. It has forced
her to deal with a real business
audience and develop a strategy in
organizing and writing her report
for the center. she said.

“Most classes treat writing as an
art form, revealing creativity and
depth,“ Gleeson said. “ ‘Written
Professional Communication‘ asks
you to write more practical things
used in business and everyday life.“

Business and economics major
Philip Sales said that the class gets
the students to face a realistic situa-
tion. “It prepares you for what real
businesses deal with." I

The class also gives students a
chance to talk to people in profes-
sional fields. Fakles believes the per-
sonal story is just as important as
statistical data found in researching
a career.

“Sometimes, it is the personal
story that makes a difference in a
person's decision toward a particu-
lar career." she said.

The Pitt News, Friday, March 2, I984

The issue of animal usage in
experimental procedures is con-
troversial. Both researchers and
animal welfare advocates claim
they are interested in the same
thing: animal welfare.

Universities across the coun-
try, including Pitt, use animals in
biomedical and psychological
research. Much of the research is
financed through grants and cor-
porate donations.

Mobilization for Animals,
with national headquarters in
Columbus, Ohio, a mile north of
the Ohio State University cam-
pus, is concerned with animal
treatment.

A two-year-old, non-profit
organization, Mobilization for
Animals organized a world-wide
demonstration against animal
mistreatment on April 24, 1983.
Over 40,000 people in four
American cities and I4 European
and Australian cities participat-
ed.

Lorri Houston, field coordina-
tor at the ‘national headquarters,
said she was given what she
termed the red-carpet treatment

‘ when touring laboratories
nationwide.

However, she said, volunteer
members were not allowed to
copy documents on animal

research at the Wisconsin
Regional Primate Center in
Madison.

United Action for Animals
claims that 60 percent to 75 per-
cent of animal experiments per-
formed are redundant or
duplicative, a figure Houston felt
was too low. Houston called the
records kept by researchers “a
joke” and said laws meant to pro-
tect animals are weak.

Ohio State University paid a
$500 fine after the U.S. Depart-
ment of Agriculture charged that
its cat colony had been improp-
erly handled.

Dr. Robert Hamlin, professor

’of _veterinary physiology and

pharmacology and a member of
the council on research for the
American Veterinary Medicine
Association, said OSU shipped
the cats to a private facility in
Kansas City, Mo., and that they,
in turn, sent them to the Univer-
sity of Missouri.

Hamlin said he did not know
the details of the charge.

Like his Pittsburgh colleagues,
Dr. Hamlin stressed the impor-
tance of humane care in research.

Many animal groups claim
animal experiments are need-
lessly repetitious, ' but Hamlin
called the charges “incorrect,"
adding each study is part of a
building process. »

Pitt’s Dr. Paul Bramson said
there are practical reasons for
limiting the number of experi-
ments. The cost of the research
animals, he said, has increased,
and competition for National
Institutes of Health grants has
become keener.

Duplicative experiments
should have a difficult time get-
ting funds, he added.

Harvard is also under some
pressure to account for its work
at the New England Regional
Primate Research Center, based
in Southboro, Mass. The center,
while not the focus of an investi-

Groups call some research needless

gation, is still under strict Mobil-
ization For Animals scrutiny,
according to Houston.

The Humane Society, with
national headquarters in
Washington, D.C., stands out-
side the debate. Lauren Nethery,
assistant to the director of labor-
atory welfare, said the society
recognizes the “positive” use of
animals in research.

The society remains more of a
resource group for individuals
concerned with complaints of
abuse against all animals, not
just those in laboratories.

Efforts are currently under
way to strengthen existing
animal welfare legislation.

One proposal to amend the
Animal Welfare Act would set
up committees at all institutions
using animals in experimental
procedures and would streng-
then existing standards for
animal use and care.

Another measure, sponsored
by Sen. Robert Dole (R-
Kansas), is also designed to
improve the Animal Welfare
Act. The bill, however, has been
losing support, according to a
report by the National Society
for Medical Research Bulletin of
Jan. 1984.

procedural issues. Within the uni-
versity, there is an Animal Care
Committee composed of faculty
members from the schools involved
with animal usage and one outside
observer. The committee reports its
fundings to Senior Vice—Chancellor
of Health Sciences Nathan Stark.

These animals and the care they
receive is also monitored by groups
from outside the university.

“First of all, we are responsible to
the United States Department of
Agriculture to make sure we comply
with the Federal Animal Welfare
Act, which is Federal law." Bramson
said.

Pitt’s facilities must also meet
standards set by the National Insti-
tute of Health and the state of Penn-
sylvania. Finally, the facility must
also be accredited by the independ-
ant American Association for the
Accredation of Laboratory Animal
Care agency.

The Department of Agriculture
maintains a regional veterinarian
who conducts unannounced inspec-
tions of research facilities —- includ-
ing Pitt’s —— and examines the
condition of the physical plant, the
animal’s housing and feed supplies
and the condition of each individual
animal. These checks occur at least
once a year, but may happen as

. many as four times in a given I2-

month period. The Pitt facility was
subject to such an inspection two
weeks ago and passed with no
conditions.

After the procedure is completed,
the incision is closed and covered, or
left uncovered, depending on the
area involved. Unlike human

with an anti-infection agent, the
healing area is not a pretty sight, but
the treatment may help to maximize
the comfort of the animal.

Post-operatively, the animal is
again administered pain-killers, and
it is kept as quiet and as comfortable
as possible. Extra foam mats are
placed on the cage floor to increase
comfort.

The nature of biomedical research
often requires tissue specimens from
a treated animal. Those animals
having served their scientific pur-
pose are put to sleep by injection.
Their involved tisssues are removed
for pathological study.

Bramson stresses that the empha-
sis at Pitt is placed on the humane
treatment of the animals housed
there. Dr. Richard Yoxheimer, of
the Department of Agriculture
office in Harrisburg, said publically
in September I983 that research
facilities at the University of Pitts-
burgh are routinely “way above
standards." He added, “The institu-
tions, in general, far exceed our
requirements." ‘

Since I9] I, the United States
has participated in an interna-
tional treaty that calls for the
killing of 24,000 to 28,000 male
fur seals on Alaska’s Pribilof
Islands each year.

During four weeks of every
summer, the Humane Society of
the United States has docu-
mented the herding and clubbing
of young, “bachelor” seals by
government-salaried Aleut llldl-
ans, natives of the Islands. The
seals, stunned or dead, are lined
up, bled to death and then
skinned. Their carcasses are left
behind in the grass ofthe Pribilo
tundra. I

Yesterday, U.S. Senators and
their aides were briefed on the
plight of the North Pacific fur
seal in recognition of the
National Day of the Seal. The

Humane Society seized the.

opportunity to draw attention to
the decline of the fur seal popula-
tion and to persuadegovernment
officials not to ratify the current
treaty, which will expire in
October.

The Interim Convention of

treaty, with Canada and Japan
each receiving 15 percent of the
seal pelts from the Pribilof hunt
and the U.S. keepingthe other 70
percent. Under the treaty‘s
terms, the Soviet Union is per-
mitted to conduct a similar but
smaller hunt on its territory and
must divide the pelts in the same
way between Canada and Japan.

This summer, the last hunt
under the terms ‘of the present
treaty is scheduled to be con-
ducted, but the Humane Society
wants it cancelled. According to
a Humane Society close-up
report, the current North Pacific

gered Species Act. Since the
l960s, the Humane Society has
prepared documentation that the
population is declining at an
annual rate of 8 to I0 percent.
In April. negotiations will
begin for a new treaty, and the
Humane Society sees it as “a u-
nique opportunity to move
toward total protection for the
North Pacific fur seal once and
for all."

In a telephone interview,
Lauren Nethery, assistant to the
Director of Research (at the
Humane Society in Washington,
said. “At the moment, the
Humane Society is working on
the development of the position
the North Pacific Fur Commis-
sion will take when negotiating a
new contract." The commission
is one of two conventions that
will determine the United States’
position in regard to the treaty.

According to the report, an
extention of the current treaty
would only legitimize the seal
killings. Instead, the Humane

‘ Society is striving for a treaty

’ based on “conservation” rather

than “exploitation."

‘Nora-Julie’ Dremieres

By LINDA HENRY

Three years ago, Swedish film and
theater director Ingmar Bergman
staged in Munich his own adaptation
of Nora-Iulie, based on A Doll's House by
Henrik Ibsen and Miss Iulie by August
Strindberg. Bergman was stimulated
by the interactions between the two
scripts and created a unified theater
piece with the intent to ”activize the

‘9‘audience...[and] challenge people to

make comparisons.”

Pittsburgh Public Theatre aI"IlSUL
director Larry Arrick has brought the
production to the Hazlett Theatre,
where he is directing the American
premiere. Unlike Bergman's produc-
tion, the PPT's staging uses the same
actors for both parts of the perfor-
mance. It is a long show, running
three hours with a half-hour inter-
mission, and is exhausting for both
the audience and the cast members,
who must go through intense mood
changes in both acts.

Nora is the lead character in Ibsen’s
A Doll's House —- a play that caused
great controversy when first pro-
duced in 1879. It depicts a woman
who, feeling suffocated by her home
life, chooses to leave her husband and

  

children to find a new life for herself.
Bergman's adaptation focuses on this
constrictiveness, and Arrick has capi-
talized on it even further by placing
all the characters, who are not part of
the action, on stage, sitting in chairs
to block Nora's exit.

April Shawhan plays Nora as a
giddy housewife turned bitter and
unrelenting. Her condescending hus-
band Torvald is played with finesse
by Dan Southern. (Shawhan and
Southern also play the leads in the
Iulie portion of the production.) Larry
John Meyers is commanding as the
pitiful villain Nils Krogstad.

Rested from a 30-minute intermis-
sion that features Scandinavian
snacks and Norwegian beer, one
sinks back into his seat only to be
assaulted again, this time by the
crazed Miss Julie. This play is a study
in hopelessness brought about by
being an odd bird caged in a restric-
tive and conventional society.

Both sets are typically PPT expen-
sive. Designed by Sam Kirkpatrick,
the Nora set is darkly omnipresent,
while the set for Iulie is deceptively
light and accessible.

Nora—]ulie runs through April 1.

Dan Southern and April Shawhan star in Nora—]uIie at the Pittsburgh
Public Theater.

Redemption can come only one
way for a band that so blatantly pla-
ces style before substanceon its list of
priorities. For Duran Duran, redemp-
tion came Tuesday night at the Civic
Arena when performance moved,
with a bullet, to the top of the list.

Granted, Duran Duran merely
seduced an audience who had already
been stuck on this band since the first
time any of it laid their eyes on the fab
five, but their appearances didn't
necessarily make the double D's job
any easier. After all, thousands of
high schoolgirls are able to garner
some pretty heavy expectations.
That none of the 9,407 Durannies
went away anything less than exhi-
larated was the band's most impres-
sive accomplishment of the evening.

From the opening excitement of"Is
There Something liShould Know?"
through the effervescent final
encore, "Girls on Film,” lead singer
Simon LeBon and company thrilled
their fans with all their top 10 mate-
rial in addition to some excellent
music that was probably new to much
of the infatuated crowd. Lesser-
known, but equally strong numbers
”Planet Earth," ”Save a Prayer" and
”The Seventh Stranger" added
weight to a set that showed Duran
Duran to be of far more substance
beneath the lights than on vinyl.

’ Anchored by the solid drumming
of Roger Taylor, the energetic guitar
work of Andy Taylor (none of Duran
Duran's three Taylors are related)
and the occasional jazzy horns of ses-
sion man Andy Hamilton, Duran
Duran had i just enough musical
punch for a tasty icing on all those

It's not nearly as vital, though, at
least now that they've made it, as
having literally millions of adoring

fans throughout the world. In spite of f

the fact that their music remains

limited, to say the least, the boundar-

Question: How do you know if a
film has surpassed the point of being
rotten and has descended into the
detestable?

Answer: When the initial‘ scene of
the film isn't as creative or enjoyable
as a homemade commercial plugging
Joe's Bar 8: Grill. I

Preppies, the latest teen exploitation
film, adds new meaning to the words
vulgar, witless and garbage. It is a
moronic film that makes previous
teen flicks (Pork;/s, Porky's II, East Times
at Ridgemont High and The Last American
Virgin) seem like Traffaut.

The ensuing paragraph would be a

-nice place to describe the plotline.

However, in Preppies, the plot is as
sparse as the clothing. Nonetheless,
it's my job, so here it goes (but don't .
say I didn't warn you!).

that they are going to be thrown out
of school — to the disgrace of their
families —— if they don't pass an eco-
nomics exam.

The boys decide that they will do

everything humanly possible to
redeem themselves and pass the test,
but only because they will lose »a
multi—million dollar trust fund if they
fail. The idiots are given an entire

weekend to prepare, so passing the

test should be as easy as 1, 2, 3. Right?

It is quite ironic that not one
moment of the film is devoted to
studying economics. On the con-
trary, this film is filled with chains,
whips, leather and a lot of heavy
breathing. I am far from being an
expert in the field, but somehow ”tits
and ass” don't seem related to eco-
nomics. Moreover, throughout this
entire film, I thought to myself, ”Gee,
it must be nice having to pass only
one college subject.” Maybe I'm doing
it wrong. ' A

Preppies, a project of Playboy, is
directed and produced by Chuck Vin-
cent. Vincent and his incompetent
cast are odious to the utmost degree,
making every aspect of this film just
as bad. The cinematography is atro-
cious, the acting abominable, the
music horrid, the editing laughable.

I hoped that, somehow, the little
creature on the Izod shirt would
materialize and devour the cast, sav-
ing the entire audience from pro-
longed torture.

Jim Carroll Band‘

Jim Carroll has been called the
heir to the title of ”Rock-n-
Roll’s Poet Laureate,” and his

/third album raises him onemore
rung on that ladder. He wraps

the poetic detail of Dylan
around the wicked wisdom of

Lou Reed in songs riding riffs '

that would make The Stones
proud.
His world, however, is pure

Carroll; a passionate, sensitive .

perspective from a tough New
York street kid. The songs
range from the rowdy to the
gloomy, like the effects of var-
ious drug-induced states, but

the lyrics on this one are »
stripped of their. usual obscure, «

hallucinatory quality: His

obsessions with angels and dev- -

ils, shadows and syringes, give
way to more simple emotions.
For instance, the title and the

MISTER HEARTBREAK

Laurie Anderson

Warner Bros.

Laurie Anderson's new lp is
not Big Science. In fact, it's so far

from it that the seven tracks A

composing Mister Heartbreak

border on accessibility. This

isn't to say that Anderson has
lost her ”vision” or sold herself
out to a public that's anxiously
been awaiting ”O, Superman
II.”

Musically, Mister Heartbreak is
very strong, employing some of
esoterica’s finest like King
Crimson’s Adrian Belew, bas-
sist Bill Laswell and drummer
Anton Fier. The album abounds
with captivating, experimental
guitar and fine rhythm and per-

cussion. However, the potential

pretentiousness of the project is
redirected by appearances by
funk guitarist Nile Rodgers,
vocalist Phoebe Snow, and
Peter Gabriel, the latter con-

final track, ”Dance the Night
Away," may be about the same
woman. The former is fast and
bittersweet: he runs around

.writing her name on the places

where her memories linger —-
on closet hooks, bathroom walls
in New Wave discos and on
stones he throws to watch sink.
”Dance the Night Away” closes
the record on a somber, mourn-
ful note. Watching thecouples
dancing across the street from
his window, the lonely protago-
nist waits in vain for the woman
who never appears, and he must
find consolation in his drug-
induced sleep.

”No More Luxuries" pulses

' like his '81 single ”People Who

Died,” with Carroll's spouting
out in hilariousidetail what his
spoiled lover must do without:
"No more luncheon out at

,,Twenty-One; What you want

now comes in a bun.”
”Freddy’s Store” is a jab at the
army as a_ capitalist venture,

spicuously dominant on the lp’s
finest cut, "Excellent Birds.”
The feel of the song is so
Gabriel-esque that one is left
wondering why it is on Ander-
son's album. But this is part of
the joy of Mister Heartbreak —— it's

- a collective effort.

”Sharkey’s Day,” a running
poetic narrative, opens the
album. Spiked with Belew's
squealing and screeching guitar,
it sets the tone of dreamy exotic
environs and establishes the
omnipresent character of Mr.
Sharkey. Sharkey’s daydream
becomes the reality of the
album; it’s.musically tight and
conceptually engrossing until
the conclusion, ”Sharkey’s
Night,” featuring the charis-
matic vocal delivery of poet Wil-
liam S. Burroughs.

Problems: Burrough’s vocals,
although interesting, disrupt
the established voice of the
-album. This comes off as an
undesirable intrusion in the

Terrific performances on this

“Also, Belew's guitar work is

"Imagination Heart Attack”

blw

' "Don't Drop It On Me”

Generic Beat
GenericBeat Products

This Erie-based band has a
witty styleof rock-n-roll that
should endear them to your
head if not your heart. This self-
prod_uced single is subtitled

J ”Pop Song” (for ”Imagination

Heart Attack”) and ”P/rotest
Song" (”Don’t Drop It On Me”)
— humorous self-mockery,
considering the band's name,
and a pretty fun stab at the
music world in general. After

. all, if one really wanted to categ-

orize _in generic terms, what else
is there besides the basic pop
song and the everyday protest
song?

"Imagination Heart Attack”
is, indeed, the typical pop song,
clocking in at a whizzing 1:43
and containing but a few silly
lyrics repeated over and over.
For example, ”Sensuality/I want
to give you all of me/But I'm all
alone/Murmur to the dialtone.”

”Don’t Drop It On Me,” set to
a fast neo-rockabilly pace, is a
sly wink at the abundance of
anti-nuke protest songs. Again,
thexlyrics are tongue-in-cheek:
”...the world is such a mess]

The Alarm
I.R.S.

It seems to be the year for
angry British musicians. Not
since 1977 have we been
besieged with so many musical
calls to action. The Alarm con-
sists of four young men with at
least one cause and, alas, the
ever-important gravity-defying
hair. They might have been
called ”Big Hair In Dismay,” but,
admittedly, ’’The Alarm” is a lit-
tle snappier. Their sound is a
‘mix of early Clash, Big Country
and U2, but — a twist —— they
play acoustic guitars and har-
monica and manage a little Bob
Dylan, too.

I wouldn't go on so about
whom The Alarm soundslike,
except that this is exactly what's
so compelling about the band.
They incorporate the best ele-
ments of the last 15 years of
rock-n-roll into what is a very
likeable amalgam.

Almost all of the songs are
about not taking any more shit
from the oppressors. ("The
oppressors” are not explicitly
identified, but I'm not sure that
that matters.) The lyrics can get
to be a little tiresome in ‘this
respect. The one song that could
be called a love song, ”Howling
Wind,” contains referencesto
”wastelands, roads, distant
drums, fire and water." Huh?
Whatever happened to good,
old-fashioned sexual issues
such as those addressed by The
Raspberries in ”Go All The
Way"?

There are a couple of great

M “things about the band. For one, _p A

gag’ ‘Viv. -“_&5<b‘l;«,‘¢-*3:.'.‘.c W419. ,ny¢_c‘,
contmueci on page seventeen ‘



Showcase, Friday, March 2; 1984

continued from page sixteen

they incorporate the anthemic
quality that U2 and Big Country
use so well. It makes everything
seem patriotic and gives a des-
perate importance to anything
they sing. They also employ the
choral shout that The Clash
used to back up their tortured
vocalist, which gives a collective
feel to the songs.

Another unusual device is the‘

occasional acoustic song that
beaks up the stream-of—raw-
intensity songs. One of these,
"Blaze of Glory,” sounds a lot
like "Tangled Up in Blue” by Bob
Dylan," and another, "We Are
the Light," is all bowed (yes,
bowed) and strummed acoustic

guitars, with a moving sing—a-I

long chorus at the end. A couple
of songs have a smattering of
superfluous, weird noises in the
background that connects The
Alarm with new psychedelia.

The point is, rock-n—roll is
nearly 30 years old, and every
new band is bound to remind
you of something that's already
been done. The Alarm, who
open for The Pretenders next
month at the Stanley, is one of
the most imaginative combina-
tions of already—forged styles to
come across‘ the sea in a while.
And they've got a ‘drummer
named "Twist" (Bono? The
Edge? Sting?). And, more
importantly, they've got silly
hair.

MICHAEL SELZ

SOFTWARE
Grace Slick
RCA

There's something admirable
about Grace Slick. Her colorful
personality and whining voice
have been behind the Jefferson
Starship for years. She's a rock-
n-roll survivor. Software is her
third solo album, and while it
lacks the eerie quality of her
first effort, Dreams, and the bite
of last year's Welcome To The
Wrecking Ball, it's her most con-
sistent album to date.

Software is an album about life,
love and technology. Slick co-
wrote all but one of the cuts,
and her attack on society and its
institutions is musical sarcasm
at its best. On her own, Slick
doesn't have a Jefferson Star-
ship_ sound (she never has), and
it sounds as if most of Software
were recorded while Slick was
trapped inside of a computer.

She has, however, a powerful

voice, and even on the album's.

worst cut ("Bikini Atoll"), it
shines through with full force.
Choruses are richly arranged
and catchy on "Through The
Window".and "It Just Won't
Stop,” but the silly chorus in
"Habits" ruins an otherwise
excellent performance. The best
cuts on the disc are a calculating,
sing—songish attack on culture,
"Call It Right, Call It Wrong,"
and an_attack on America's love
affair with technology, "All The
Machines."

GRACE SLICK

Which brings us to the prob-
lem with Software —— Slick's ten-
dency to come across as a sort of
political activist rather than a
female rock’-In-roll singer.
Though Slick seems conscious
enough to know what she's

doing, she goes a bit too far; in .

one song, she claims, "So hard

  

to change if you know what I
mean/Justify my pleasure till it
becomes obscene." On the
album cover, Slick has a toaster
printed on her chest. If we cross
our fingers, just maybe there'll
be a heart there next time. I"

Kratz returns against Ohio State

By Bob Green
The Pitt News

Senior gymnast Frank Kratz will
return to action in the all-around
this weekend, following weeks of
limited competition due to a pulled:
muscle in his right forearm.

“My arm is starting to feel good
again," said Kratz. “I am happy to
be competing in the all-around
again.”

After a two week layoff, the

, Panther gymnasts (I3-l) return to

action as they travel to Ohio State
tomorrow for a meet with the
nationally-ranked Buckeyes.

“This weekend we are going to
have our hands full," head coach
Frank D‘Amico said. “Frank

[Kratz] is back and we are back to
our full first team.”

Kratz and ~- -fellow senior Dave
Smith will be competing in only
three more meets as Panthers, and
are looking forward to the Buckeye
meet with added vigor.

“We are looking for scores to get
us to nationals again," said Smith,
who has qualified for the nationals
three straight times. “We don't have
the depth that Ohio Statedoes; they
have about 30 gymnasts where we
have only ll, so it makes winning
kind of tough." '

The underclassmen for the Pan-
thers have put for a strong effort,
despite the absence of Kratz.

Sophomores Mark Klafter and
Matt Peters are two of the reasons

Pitt is l0-I and has been tough to

beat all season.

Klafter and. Peters have both set
school records for the Panthers this
year. Klafter established all-around
and parallel bar marks, while Peters
shattered the high bar record.

Sophomore Mar-ty Comini has
been coming into his own as of late
for the Panthers, also.

“I feel strong going into the meet,”
Comini said. “Going against a top
team like Ohio State doesn’t bother

wit

me.

Pitt’s chances of qualifying for the
nationals as a team are rather-thin,
and this weekend will provide the
squad with a good opportunity to
look at how they will react to the
pressures of top-notch talent.

The Panthers travel to Slippery
Rock next week and finish up the
season when they host Penn State on

Panthers take early lead in

Eastern swim championships  

By Gabrielle Pease

The Pitt News

Pitt clinched the first evening of
the Eastern regional swimming and
diving competition last night at East
Carolina University in Greenville,
N.C.

The Panthers were led by Greg
Murphy, Don Martin, J.D. McCril—
lis, and Ed Bahan. ‘ ‘ ‘

In the 500-yard freestyle event,
Murphy shattered his Big East
record with a winning time of
4:34.98. Tom Shaulinski placed
sixth (4:39.l6) in the event.

Martin and Rick James recorded
fast times in the 200-yard individual
medley, matching their one-two fin-
ish two weeks earlier at Big East.
Martin won in _l:53.77 while James

7 touched in l:54.06.

Bahan placed fourth (2! .48) in the
50-yard freestyle event before lead-
ing off the 800-yard freestyle relay
team with‘ Murphy, McCrillis, and
Martin.The foursome claimed top
spot with a 6:53.43 clocking.

After the first evening ofcompeti-

said. ' _ .

Last night’s results fueled the
lightning-fast times fired two weeks
ago when Pitt hosted the Big East
championships at Trees Pool.

The swimmers hope to finish this
meet with times that will qualify

hopes the speeds posted during the
Big East finals will continue to be
topped in tomorrow’s events.“The

Coach Lewis said.

Don Martin, Rick James, and

Awards take back seat to title for Lady Panthers

By Laurie Kubli
The Pitt News

The honors have been raising for
Lady Panther basketball team faster
than Pitt’s tuition, but the_y may
amount to little more than honors to
glance at; bittersweet memories of a
team that almost made it.

Tonight, the Lady Panthers (6-3
in the Big East, I5-ll) are at St.
John’s Alumni Hall for the second
round of the Big East conference

playoffs. They will be playing the
winner of last night’s Connecticut(0- v

8)-Boston College (2-6) game.
There are no second chances here.
Judy Saurer, just selected confer-
ence coach of the year on _Wednes-
day, has no delusions about her No.

4 I-seeded team’s challenge.

‘Its a brand new season. I think it ’s going to
be a competitive tournament.’

--Judy Saurer

 

“It's a brand new season," Saurer
said. “I think it’s going to be a com-
petitive tournarrient. Anybody

could win it.” A

Pitt has dominated conference
play on the work of co-player of the
year Jennifer Bruce, whose 24.3

points per game average tops the Big

East. Bruce has been ranked in the ‘

t-‘op I5 scorers in the nation and also
finished second in rebunding (9.7)

and third in field-goal percentage ’

(.572).

“Jennifer's been our most consist- .

ent player this year despite being

double— and even triple-teamed."
Saurer said. “I was ‘concerned about

‘ whether our other players, could
relievethe pressure on Jennifer, and

they have comethrough. They have
really delivered."

The seniorless squad that had lost
an I8-point—per-game scorer in Pain
Miklasevich was expected to finish
no better than third in the confer-
ence, and even that was a high
estimate.

Syracuse and Seton Hall, ironi-
cally, the only two Big East teams to
defeat Pitt this season, closely
trailed the Lady Panthers in the pre-
season voting, as they were picked to
finish tied for-fourth. '

They were among four teams to
finish with 5-3 records, with Seton
Hall receiving the fourth spot and
Syracuse thefifth seed. Providence
(6th) and St. John's (3rd), who will
face each other tonight also finished
at 5-3. Second—seeded Villanova (6-
2) takes on the number seven seeded
Georgetown (4-4). .

Pitt entered last season’s tourna-
ment ranked sixth and were
squeezed out by Georgetown in the

first round. Saurer is cautiousLy
optimistic about the squad‘s chances
in the tournament.

We're a young team and still
growing,” Saurer said. “We haven’t
peaked yet as a group. but our team

‘ is working more as a unit.”

Youth is the rule rather than the
exception on this team, and it has
proven effective. Another honor
bestowed upon the Lady Panthers is
Julie Callan’s selection to the All-
Freshman team.

Despite being left off the all-
league team, point guard Kim Tirik
has consistently been one of the top
two assist leaders, both over all and
in conference play. Tirik‘s I73 assists

this season are approaching the,

team record established by ‘Debbie
Lewis in her senior year. During the
I98!-82 campaign, Lewis handed
out I86 assists. 7

_ Stephanie Collins is Pitt’s answer

I to a collapsed zone defense, often

coming off the bench in tight situa-
tions to sink a few long shots. Lisa
Fubio. also contributes to the
offense, but her agressive defense
has been instrumental to Pitt’s
success as Fubio has 55 steals this
season.

Ellen Gilhooley and freshman»

Jenny Tyner help Bruce at the for-
ward position.

Anchored by Bruce and Callan,
the inside game should produce
points. The Lady Panthers’ outside
shooting has sometimes been
erratic, but has to be consistent this
weekend. Turnovers" have’also
derailed the team, at times.

“Our team is working together,”
said Saurer. “It will be a marathon,
andghopefully, we'll play all three
days.”

Panther runners

missing from meet  

By Dale Moore
The Pitt News

The Panther track team travels to
Princeton, N.J., this weekend to
take part in the oldest track and field
championships in the United States,
the Intercollegiate Amateur Athletic
Association of America Champion-
ship. -

Coach John Vasvary will lead the
Panthers into the IC4As this week-
end. However, Vasvary will be miss-
ing two important runners.

Senior Bill Moorhead and junior
Roger Kingdom will not be compet-
ing for Pitt this weekend. Moor-
head, who ran 3249.2 in the
l,500-meter run last weekend at
West Virginia, will miss this week-
end’s competition to take‘the Law
School Admissions Test.

Moorhead is a key member of
both the distance—medley and two-
mile relay teams, two events’ in
which the Panthers will not compete
this weekend. Not being able to
compete this weekend, Moorhead
will not qualify for the 1,500-meter
run in the national championships
next weekend at Syracuse. How-
ever, the relay team has the third-
fastest collegiate time in the country
and has already qualified for the
NCAA championships.

Kingdom will be taking a week off
from competition to prepare for the
NCAA championships after placing
fourth at the TAC national cham-
pionships last Friday at East
Rutherford, N.J. Kingdom, the
defending NCAA outdoor high-
hurdle and Big East champion, has
the fastest collegiate time in the
nation in the 55-meter hurdles.

Senior Todd Colas will take a shot
at Pitt’s mile record in the IC4A’s
‘meet. Colas, whose time in the
l,000-meter run tanks in the top five

in the nation, will have to better
Jerry Richie’s time of 4205.2.

With the NCAA championships
only a week away, it is hard for Vas-
vary not to look ahead.

“We’re trying to win,” Vasvary
said. “It is an honor to qualify and
run and win, but the main focus for
Todd and Garland [Brown] is the
NCAAS.”

Brown has qualified for the trip to
Syracuse in the 800-meter run, and
his time places him in the top five
collegiate runners in the nation.
Brown, however, has a history of
Achilles’ tendon problems, and Vas-
vary will be watching him closely
this weekend.

“Right now — knock on wood —
we’re in pretty good shape," Vasvary
said. “Garland’s Achilles’ isn't both-
ering him now, and he ran a real
good workout yesterday. He’s going
to run this weekend, but if it starts to
bother him, he will stop right there.”

The meet-will give some Panthers
the opportunity to gain experience.
Freshmen Tim Manes, Alan Laws,
Shane Saunders and Jesse Mikell
will team up to run the mile relay for
the Panthers. Mikell broke the 300-
meter dash record for Pitt at the Big
East indoor championships two
weeks ago and anchored the Panther
mile relay that finished third at the
championships.

The meet will also mark theilast
appearance for triplejumper Ralph
Mitton, senior engineering major

. who placed third in the Big East with

al leap of 49-3 '/2.

“Ralph is everything you could
ask for in a senior.” said Vasvary.
“He is a good team leader and
always gives 100 percent.“

The Panthers will not be at full
strength this weekend at Princeton,
but although they will be small in

best time is about six seconds," he
jokingly responded.

Reminiscing about when he him-
self was about to surpass Don Hen-
non in I978, Harris said, “I really

' didn’t realize it until the announcer
at Massachusetts made an
announcement and they handed me
the ball.”

Now, the scenario has changed,
and Harris, an insurance salesman,
gets to experience the other end ofit.

“I think it‘s great to see one ofour
fellow [Pitt] men be successful,"
Harris said. “I remember what Tim
Grgurich told me before my senior
season: ‘We have a chance to be suc-

O. cessful as a team and that's more

important‘.

“I can only say what I hope for
Clyde Vaughan in the future. He’s a
hard worker, and he’s gonna be suc-
cessful, whether it be just going to
work every day or playing in the
NBA. l hope he can look back when
he’s 70 or 72 years old and say, ‘We
lived a good life.’ " ,

. Another cynical reporter asked

Harris if, with all this praise, he was

offering Vaughan a job.

“I hope I don't have to offer him a

‘ job for another six/ or seven years

after he’s played for somebody in the

NBA," Harris said.

Vaughan‘s future may not lie in
the NBA, but Pitt coach Roy Chip-
man believes it doesn‘t matter. 

“Clyde Vaughan will be successful
whether he ever plays a minute of
professional basketball ~ that’s
what kind of kid he is."

“The talk oifathe scoring record is

even thought about keeping him out
and saying. ‘there, you can’t break
the record, now go play basketball.‘

“Every shot that he takes is like
the winning basket. That’s a lot to
ask of a 2|-year-old kid. If he does
break it on Saturday, he could raise
some hell in Madison Square
Garden."

Billy Culbertson, another of the

confessed his disappointment in bat-
tling to stay out of the basement
after being expected to finish as high
as third by some overzealous pre-
season polls.

“This year has definitely been a
disappointment,” Culbertson said.
“We thought we could finish third or
fourth."

Culbertson know’s that, like
Vaughan, he will be bidding farewell
Saturday against Providence.

“There will be no way that we
won’t come out and play the best
game of the year,” he said.

hasn't gone tosleep at all.“

Still, Chipman thinks his team
will quickly forget Wednesday’s
mauling at the Capital Centre and
play the brand of basketball that
they have been displaying of late.

 “If we can’t beat Providence in a
big game on our home court, then
we don’t deserve to be seeded higher

Chipman also knows that there
would not be a more-deservingway
