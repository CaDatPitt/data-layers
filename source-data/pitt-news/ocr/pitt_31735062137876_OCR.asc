Collegiate Utopia
To Reign During
Rushing Season

Fraternities To Open Warfare
For Freshman Prospects
Friday Morning

‘Join In,’ Says Seidle

By Ben W, Baskin
Fraternity rushing, the dream of

‘every freshman, swings into action on
October 5, at 8:30

o’clock. Freshmen, not yet college-
- wise, ‘should be prepared for nine
days of free lunches, cigarettes.

dances taxi-cabs, football games. and
beautiful blind dates. The rushing
period, also known as “Collegiate
Utopia,” will extend until 2 o’clock.
Sunday morning, after the Southern
California tilt.

During rushing period, freshmen
will be the “best guys in the world.’’
They’ll be waited on hand and foot.
They’ll meet new friends at the rate
of two per minute. They’ll be intro-
duced to the wonders of ping-pong, and
they’ll find that there is a brother-
hood of man.

Even if freshmen do not intend
pledging a fraterni_ty that takes an in-
terest in rushing" . them, N. Robert
Seidle, assistant to the dean of men,
advocates taking advantage of all in-
vitations. _

“Take advantage of all rushing in-
vitations as it is but a ‘once in a life-
time’ occurrence,” says wiser upper-
class counselors.

If freshmen tell the fraternities
that they are champion football play-
ers. debaters. dancers, and humorists.
the fraternities will probably take
them out to the town's smartest night
clubs instead of just the fraternity,
houses. This idea, however, has some
drawbacks. Ten or twenty fraternity
men will surround them and ﬁll them
with rushing talk, thus cutting them
off from their dates_ Another disa.d-
vantage is the fact that some frater
may ask for a demonstration of the
three-point block with him for the
beneﬁt of the rest of the boys at a
smoker. Freshmen can on the other
hand. say -that they are expert bowl-
ers as none of the fraternity houses
have bowling alleys. Bulling, yes, but
not bowling.

100 Graduates Placed 

By Bureau, Barton’s 
Records Show ,
I

Two-thirds of the 150 graduates of ,
the class of 1934 who applied at the;
University placement bureau for aid’
in securing employment, have, been
successfully placed. In compiling this
enviable record, Mr. Clyde C. Barton,
director of the bureau, reports plac-
ing graduates in diversiﬁed com-
mercial and technical ﬁelds at the
rate of one job every other day. The
bureau also performed the unusual
feat of securing positions for all grad-
uates of the department of oil and gas
of the School of Mines.

Mr. Barton decried the fact that
only 150 of last year’s graduates reg-
istered their experience and capabili-
ties with the bureau, thereby causing:
many unemployed graduates to lose}
valuable opportunities for gainingl
work. The bureau, through advertis-,
ing, has now been placed on practical-|
ly the same basis as commercial em-‘
ployment agencies, and is in an im-
proved --position to help students and
graduates.

ODAY MARKS THE BEGINNING of what is

usually the most hectic week of the fall term,
as both activities and men ’s fraternities make their
appeals to new students.

Before freshmen have learned their class sclied-

‘ ules, or in most cases digested the ﬁrst chapters of

texts and collateral readings campus activities
are to be waved before their eyes and campus fra-
ternities are to commence that peculiar soc1al.com-
petition so well described by the word, “rusliing.”
The confusion of one shown all the fraternities
of the earth, after being invited to cast himself
down among the activities, calls for an emotional
bromide. _
That both activities and fraternities offer rich
potentialities for the growth of personality is so
stale a truism that it should not require a coni-
plete sentence. At the University, particular serv-
ice is rendered by men ’s fraternities in supplying
something like adequate campus housing. for fra-
ternity members; and athletics, joiirrialisiii, dra-
inatics and discussion furnish opportunities for ex-
pression and management. _ _
Yet most new students will be in a daze this
week, if they follow the social calendar; and the
educational value of “dazes” is dubious. Imme-
diately following the Druid activities smoker
‘Wednesday, when an activities—minded freshman
will blithely assign himself to three or four extra-
curricular jobs, he is asked to select his fraternity
from among the claims and counter-claims of
fresliman-minded smoothies. _
Too much, we believe, is expected to happen in
the adjustments of new students during the Week
of October 1, when familiarity with ‘courses of
study would ordinarily commence. In this respect,
men ’s fraternities might be beneﬁted utimately by
the deferred rushing plan of Panhellenic council.

The English Invasion

HIE BRITISH ARE COMING!
T A little more than 150 years ago that fact would

have been enough to make Paul Revere jump onto his
horse and scuttle through the countryside with the news.
But today the Anglican invasion assumes less ominous
proportions.

For in November the Oxford university debaters, bent
on their annual forensic conquest of the states, will en-
gage a Pitt team on the local campus. There might be
cause for mild alarm in this—if the visitors were re-
cruited from the ranks of the brown-shirted Fascisti led
by that British version of Adolph Hitler, Sir Oswald
Then it would be time for the editorial writers
of VVilliam Randolph Hearst to reach for their typewrit-
ers and pound out blurbs about communism, bolslievism,
and un-American propaganda.

But the probability is that our Oxford men will be
pink—cheeked, tea-drinking esthetes whose mild danger is
that they may pursue too religiously the pan-America
policy of George Bernard Shaw.

The only fault with this annual Oxfordization of Amer-
ica is that it smells of playing on the gullibility of the
public—a public that is eager to do obeisance to any-
thing with an exotic name.
borhood of 100 dollars is paid to the Oxford debaters by
the obseqiiious host and one-sided questions are used
with Oxford assuming the favored side. All of which
savors of a noblesse oblige, an irritating condesceiision,
on the part of the Oxonians.

It is far from the purpose of this editorial to debunk
the visit of the Oxford debate team as a racket. That
is, it is not a racket if the marriage of titled nonentities
to American heiresses and the lectures insulting Amer-
ica and everything American by superannuated British
novelists and playwrights are not both rackets.

something ought to be done about this .

Freshman regulations, those long forgotten remnants
of collegiatism, should be called back into active being!
Sophs should be turned loose! In fact somebody must
do something! Freshmen should be subservient to their
betters! The present rampant uppisliness that the frosh
are ﬂaunting in the mugs of digniﬁed upperclass
smoothies is intolerable! The Phi Gains must be slip-
ping! Also Kappa Sigs, Delts, Phi Delts, Sigma Chis, et
al. In years gone by could a frosli become editor of the.

ever have been captain of the football team? Never!
But this is still worse! What upperclasser in his frosh
year would have dared to become president of ODK?
None! Yet these are nothing to the great insult that
has been ﬂagrantly waved in the map of horriﬁed stu-
dents! Rise to your guns, or penknives, or bobby pins! The
breath-taking daring of one male freshman after being
attached to this institution for only one week, and a
foreigner (he’s from Chicago) at that, is the greatest af-
front to senior dignity that has ever been perpetrated on
an unassuming (oh yeah) university! Now is the time
for all good——no, wait, that’s wrong——. Now is the time
to stamp out the menace of uppishness that is insidious-
ly devouring the self-respect of our student body. The

Thereby Hangs A Tale

By Raymond Pearlman

S ALL VVRITING is a matter of allusion, to quote

Professor Hunt, I suggest that my reader refer him-
self to Plato’s “Lysis” in order more fully to understand
the structure of this dialogue. I might add that you can
send my apologies to Plato, that is, in case you reach
the Shades before I do.

Persons Of The Dialogue

Russel Case, who is the narrator.

Lee Sowman.

Jeﬁry Agely.

Scene: on the stairs in front of the Cathedral.

I was going from Alumni hall straight to_ the book-
store, intending to take the short-cut which is close to
the drive. When I came to the stairs of Thaw hall I fell
in with Agely and a company of young men who were
standing with him. Agely, seeing me approach,’ asked
me whence I came and whither I was going.

I am going, I replied, from Alumni hall to the book-
store.

Then, come straight with us, he said; and put in: you
may as well. There is the building» at which we all
meet, and a goodly company we are.

And what is the building I asked; and what sort of
entertainment have you?

The building, he replied, is a newly-erected cathedral;
and the entertainment is generally conversation, to
which you are welcome.

Thank you, I said. Is there any teacher there?

Yes, he said, your old friend and admirer, Lee
Sowman.

Indeed, I replied; he is a very eloquent debater.

’Are you then disposed, he said, to go with me, and
hear them?

Delighted, I replied.

Thereupon, I walked with him along the Memorial for
the Soldiers, passing in the meantime ostentatious cars

of all makes. Upon entering we found the boys had just
been hazing a few freshmen, but this was nearly at an
end. Certain boys were playing at that old Greek pas-
time, dice. There was also a circle of onlookers, bet-
ting on the side; yet the most attractive group was the
one on our right from which resounded, as we tliought,
a lie-atedaltercation. VVe, of course, sauntered over to-
ward them and suddenly heard a most ironical voice pro-
claim:

“A rational interpretation of music! You must be
mad. Such a thing would take all joy out of music.”

mean. I grant you that music more than any other art.
is dependent upon the sensitivity of man. But ﬁrst of
all, answer me this: Do you construe music as a lan-
guage?”

“Undoubtedly I do.”

“Then, if you wanted to understand Greek or Latin or
French or Sanskrit, would you not, ﬁrst of all, attempt
to study them through the medium of their grammar?
Vvould you not ﬁrst attempt to learn the structure of the
language ?”

“I would.”

“Then as you progressed in your study, you would
‘earn the rhetorical devices, the so-called ‘ﬁne points,’
the ﬁgures of speeclies?”

“Yes.”

“Finally, if you did not deceive yourself, you would
master the language?”

“Yes,_ but I am sorry, Lee, I do not see the analogy.”

“Listen further, and answer me truthfully. Had you
not mastered the language, would you have been able to
appreciate it?”

“I admit I could only appreciate and enjoy the con-
coction of the syllables, that is, their sonority, although
the words themselves would be utterly meaningless.”

“Well, then, is my theory of understanding music
through knowledge, through knowing music, rather than
through emotion, now coming to light?”

“Yes, it is. But do you mean to infer that all people
who do not know the grammar of music have no appre-
ciation of music? Do you mean to infer that the thou-
sands of people who go to concerts and who know noth-
ing whatsoever about the intricate structure of a syni-
phouy, have no understanding of music, and hence caii-
not appreciate music?”

“That is precisely what I mean.”

“Then, allow me to take an analogy as you did. Can
only a mechanic appreciate the rhythm of a motor?
Cannot you or I, as we drive a, road in a 16-cylinder
Cadillac, appreciate the music of the hum in that car?
Must we be botanists to appreciate the tall pines of the
Sierras? or must we know the intricate structure of each
needle and leaf to appreciate them? Take the human
body. Must . .”

“Pardon my interruption, but I cannot let you go on
and prove my point. Each example you gave surely il-
l.uniines my argument. Your last one, especially, does.
The music of the workings of the human body .' . if
we are allowed to stretch the deﬁnition of music this
far . . can only be appreciated and understood when
we have mastered its language. You viewthe body ex-
ternally, and what do you see as compared with the body
internally? Thus it is with music. Music viewed exter-
nally is as shallow and as bare as the body viewed ex-
ternally.”

Here I was going to invite the opinion of a few pro-
fessors staiiding smoking between classes, when sudden-
ly we were interrupted by an over-exuberance on the
part of one of the boys trying to roll a three. At ﬁrst,
we and the bystanders drove them off, and bade them
go home; but afterwards as they wouldnot mind, and
only went on shouting their barbarous dialect, and got
angry, and kept shouting, we fairly gave way and broke
up the company.

New Fine Arts
Rejects Cloister Attitude

Philip Elliott Tries To

 

By Marjorie Reich I

“Art for art's sake,” cry the intel-!

lectuals, but now it’s art for Pitt stu-

dents since the induction this fall of

Philip Elliott as assistant professor in I
the ﬁne arts department.

By proving to his students that art,
isn’t nearly as cloistered a subjectl
as is generally supposed, this youth-I,
ful addition to the University faculty!
wants to spread a more general‘
knowledge of the. way the artist
works; to establish a closer contacté
between the student and the actual‘
work of art; and to permit develop-
ment of some of the tremendously in-
teresting potentialities of ﬁne arts,,
which, according to Elliott have never‘
reached the surface in the minds of
the average Pittsburgher. -,

A career which rivals that of any!
Horatio Alger hero began in Minne-l
apolis where Elliott was born. After!
living for a few years in Europe he!
returned to the United States to,
attend the University of Minnesota.
Upon his graduation he entered the
Yale School of Fine Arts, and when
his work there was completed he or-
gaiiized his own art school at Water-
bury, Connecticut. Doing mural dec-
oration for country estates in Con-
necticut, and for buildings in New
York City kept Elliott busy until he
began teaching a course in‘ design at
the City college of New York. He
received the Chaloner fellowship for
three years’ study in Paris, given
every two years by the Chaloner
foundation. The award carried with
it besides a stipend, a studio, and
complete freedom to work. Experi-
mentation in photography kept Elliott
in Paris for a year after the fellow-

He then returned to

As_ to modern artnand the forms it
is taking, Elliott said:

“As long asour chaotic social con-
in a chaotic condition_ -There, is a.
an establishment of new ones, but
then modern art has been present in
every age. Art is a continuous devel-

ples whose qualities depend on a ﬁrm
relationship to the stream of life.”

Photography hasn't been or won’t
be a dangerous competitor to art ac-
cording to Elliott who believes:

“Painting and sculpture are grow-
ing less representative. People are
tired of having art do nothing but im-
itate nature. The realities in nature
are not to be expressed by abject vis-
ual imitation, because movement in
nature and life itself can't be record-
ed by measurement or correct pro-
portions.”

Mr_ Elliott is teaching two courses
at the University, ﬁne arts 13, and
ﬁne arts 9. In ﬁne arts 13, which is.
a course in fundamental art calcu-l
lated to expose to the beginner the
actual substructure of art which will
enable him to meet a painting eye to
eye, Elliott intends to give his stu-
dents a structural foundation which
will make them independent, of critics,
and to give them sureness in judging
art. In ﬁne arts 9, a course in the
methods of art by the. use of water
colors, fresco, and oils, he will en-
deavor to provide an instructive ap-
preciation of art from actual work-
ing through tools.

The intention was

that “Thinking It Over” is ever

pretending to be profound and schol¢

arly when it is merely impressionis-
tic. Its keen-eyed friends would never
let it get away with that for long.

Church in a New Phase

Sullen strikers of a little milltown
in South Carolina a week or so agb
-were burying some of their dead. The
Reverend James Myers, industrial’,
secretary of the Federal Council of‘
Chiirclies, was delivering the funer;-ill
oration. And his words were in part.
“These men were instruments of Jesus
.-Christ in his work of love . . They
died to make industry Christian .

It is a test of Christian unselﬁshness

3)

This incident is another example-
of a striking change, I think, in the
attitude of American, even European,
religious bodies toward the present
economic setup. One of the severest
criticisms against the Church, so far.
as it spea.ks on extra-religious topics,
has been that it upholds the status;
quo. Preachers have been supposed,§
by their critics, to voice the economic;
philosophy of the men who kept the?
ﬁnancial affairs of their particular;
congregation solvent. One of the,’
main excuses claimed by the Soviets
in Russia for their violent propaganda
of atheism was that the clergy there
_was in corrupt league with the Czarist
faction to encourage superstition, ig-
norance, and oppression of the peas-
ants.

* *

N OTHER ‘WORDS, to use a bor-
rowed analogy, the Churcli organ-
ization had become, even to many
quite religious people, a group of
Pharisees, advocates of inaction; the
original Pharisees, incidentally being
the very people whose characteristics
Christ deplored.

But there is certainly a new move-
ment in the Church today. Father
Couglilin, the radio priest, who has
gained amazing popularity, is perhaps
the outstanding example of a theolo-
giau denouncing evils in the existing
order. The Pope himself, in one of
his encyclicals, has shown an obvi-
ously liberal spirit toward politics
and economics. And a minority bloc
in a recent convention of Methodists,
if I remember correctly, almost suc-
ceeded in inserting a series of really
radical resolutions into the group's
report.

Whether you are in sympathy with
this tendency or not. you cannot help
but realize, I think, that it is gather
ing force. If it accomplishes nothing
else, it will probably strengthen the
inﬂuence of the Church, which sever-
al religious leaders and lay observers,
have felt has been considerably
weakened,

Farewell to Metaphors
ITH THE’ RETIREMENT or
General Hugh S, Johnson as
dictator of the NRA, the United States
has lost a literary artist of the ﬁrst

the “gold ﬁsh bowl” and “cracking
down” are, I fear, past.

It is hard for one who has not
known Johnson personally to venture
an estimate of him. To his credit is
the universally admitted fact that he
was an indefatigable worker, a nia.n
of unceasing energy. The work of or-
ganizing the NRA even to the ineffec-
tive jumble that it is now was a co-
lossal task, and Johnson headed that
effort.

On the other hand, the General pre-
sented an entirely different portrait

blustering, picturesque clown, and
that is a. dangerous impression for

‘rec-¢oocoo¢ooo4

By Wilbur Clark
T WAS, MRS. FISHER observed to
her neighbor, Mrs. Charles, who
in her backyard on the other side of
the fence was hanging out a. washing
too, a dandy drying day. A stiff
breeze bellowed out the shirts on the
lines, especially Jim -Fisher's night
shirt which, in its inﬂated condition,
much resembled the American defend-
er Rainbow’s balloon spinnaker, and
the sun blazing in a cloudless sky
ﬁlled the yard with noisy, ﬂapping
shadows.

“Yes, ain't it though,” mumbled Sa-
die -Charles, who always carried a
clothes pin in her mouth when- she
hung up clothes though she reached in
the bag swaying on the line when she
needed another.

“These things ought to be all dry
come eleven o’clock.”_ Mrs. Fisher
hung up the last towel from her
basket, tucked a wisp of grey hair
back under her dust cap, and came
over to lean on the fence.

Sadie shook out a pillow slip, pin-
ned it on the line where it immediate-
ly -joined in the dance with Tom
-Charles’ long underwear, Tom
Charles wore long underwear the year
“round. It was due to this practice, he
maintained, that he hadn’t had a cold
in ten years. ‘

Mr. A1 Brown, the Fisher's next
door neighbor, came out the kitchen
door, deposited a package of garbage
in the can, quietly replaced the lid,
and went back in.

“You know there’s something funny
about that man,” said "Sadie. She
took the clothes pin out of her mouth.
came over to the fence, and nodded
towards the Brown’s garbage bucket.
“It just ain’t natural for a man to ﬂu
housework and like it the way he
does.”

RS. FISHER nodded her head,
still staring at the Brown’s
back porch.

“You know,” continued Sadie
Charles, “I saw him go out in the
back lot there with a shovel and bury
something again last night after
dark.”

“Did you now? That’s funny; I've
noticed him doing that too. Wonder
what it is that he has to hide in the
ground, and after dark too.”

‘‘I shouldn’t wonder, for my part,
if it was money. You know, they say
he lost a lot when the bank closed last
year. Maybe he’s making sure he'll
be able to put his hands on it when
he wants it.”

“No, I don’t think that’s it.” Mrs.
Fisher frowned. “He’s awfully queer
allriglit, but I don’t think he’s that

queer. I would like to know, though.
what it is.”
Mrs. Charles’ door bell rang and

put an end to their speculations.

The next morning early Mrs_ Fish-
er yoo-liooed over the back fence, and
when Sadie Charles came out, took
something from under her apron and
passed it over to her. “I dug it up
last night,” she whispered. “I just
couldn't sleep for thinking about it.”

Mrs. ‘Charles shook the tin can,
gazed in it at the rusty razor blades.
and then looked at Mrs. Fisher with
her mouth open.

Begin October 17

Undergraduates Who Can'y At
Least 12 Credits Eligible;
Varsity Men Barred

 

 

The third annual track and field
meet will be held beginning October
17 and 19 at the Stadium, with the
exception of the discus and javelin
events which will take place at the
football practice ﬁeld.

All undergraduates carrying at
least twelve credits are eligible to
participate. For further information
those interested should see the follow-
ing: W. D, Harrison, director of ath-
letics; John Dambach, director of
physical education; Carl Olson, track
coach; James Potts, assistant track
coach; William Dornenburrg, track
and cross-country manager.

Many of those who believe in Coach
Olson’s prediction that any boy
who has a good heart and a pair of
legs can become a varsity letterman
have begun extensive practice. This
meet is held solely for those who
have never taken an active part on
previous Pitt track teams. Letter-
men from previous years are not eligi-
ble to participate.

For those who are interested, an
entry blank is published in this edi-
tion of the Pitt News. It is very es-

Traclzmen Come

To F o r e While
Football Pauses

By Charles A. Ruch

Now that the curtain has gone up
on the current football season, with
all the attendant fuss and excitement,
there appears to be little left to do
but to sit back and wait for the third
act. Of course, the second act will
have considerably more than a minor
degree of tension, but the fact that it
will take place in a foreign setting
will detract a little from the appeal.
Tlierefore, we’ll sit by for the third
ac .

All of which is merely a dramatic
way of saying that the opening game
of the season is out of the way, that
VVest Virginia will furnish a lot of
stiff opposition next Saturday at Mor-
gantown, and that, after all, every-
body is just marking time until the
Trojans from the sunny shores of
California are with us on October 13.
VVhat mistakes there were last Sat-
urday against \Vash—Jeff will likely
be ironed out in time to allow plenty
of margin against the Mountaineers.
but beyond that lies . what? That
‘‘what’‘ will be the worry of tl1e coach.-
ing staffs for the next fortnight. Mean-
while we’ll veer off on another tack, a
tack about track.

The third annual fall track and field
meet has succeeded in bringing out
enough candidates to overﬂow the
track locker room with aspiring and
perspiring athletes. Doubtlessly, the
situation can be handled while the
trackmen yet have the spacious
stadium accommodations to draw up-
on, However, the thought of what
will happen when the weather be-
comes cold and the indoor season
gets under way is something that is
causing Carl Olson and his associates
a deal of worry.

For many years now there has been
a cry for a University track and ﬁeld
house. The turnout which has greet-
ed the track coaches this year cer
tainly proves that track is here to
stay. Track athletes, too, are yearly
becoming more and more ambitious
to stay out for the sport. Vvhoever
it is who holds the athletic purse:
strings might well give a thought to
the trackers and, following the
thought, a new home.

Wrestling Team Will Begin
Practice Early This Week

All candidates and members of last
year’s wrestling team are asked to
report to Coach Bradford (Mose) Ils-
ley at the stadium sometime this
week, the earlier the better.

VVrestling now rates as an outstand-
ing sport at Pitt and all those desir-
ing to take part should report at once
in order to get into proper condition
for the coming season. Weight means
nothing in this sport, as there are
classes ranging from 115 pounds to
the heavyweight division.

through the second quarter, the Pan-

sucker play to start the scoring.
\Veinstock kicked the extra point.
Just before the half ended, Weinstock
slammed through the line on a short
buck for Pitt’s second touchdown.
V‘/ith the second half little more
than under way, Dan Croft, President
sub, broke loose for an 87-yard touch-
down run on a sweep around end.
Weinstock opened the fourth quar-
ter by plunging the line for Pitt’s
third score, and W&J’s offside-play
gave Pitt the extra point.

150-Pound Football Team i
Hits Pre-Season S I u m p‘

 

 

According to Coach Bob Hogan, the]
prospects for a 150-pound football,
team at the University of Pittsburgh
this year are dim due to a lack of.
candidates. The coaches have been
further hampered because -of the ina-
bility of many of the aspirants to at-
tend practice sessions regularly.

The squad, which is in reality a
rookie aggregation, is open to all men
who have not had any football expe-
rience. The candidates who show the
most promise will be sent up to the
varsity and freshman squads. No
games will be scheduled until a well-
balanced team has been whipped into
shape. . «

WSGA Committee Finds Homes
For Out-Of-Town Students

Through the efforts of Miss Isabelle
Anderson, assistant dea.n of women,
and with the aid of the Housing com-
mittee of VVSGA, all out-of—town
woma.n students now enrolled at the
University have been placed in
homes, Little change from previous
years has been noted in the number
of women students from out of town
now enrolled. Approximately 37 stu-
dents are living at sorority houses;
the same number live at boarding
houses approved by the committee,
and approximately 30 live with rela-
tives in town. A few students are
working for their room and board.

The Housing committee, under the
chairmanship of Bernice Allen, C36,
is in charge of the organization of
student houses. It makes regulations
and suggestions designed to make the
life in the houses as pleasant and
home-like as possible. While life in
boarding houses cannot be closely
supervised, the committee, working
with Miss Anderson, investigates each
house carefully before placing it on
the approved list.
