Office

Nears
Revival

By DIANE LEFKOWITZ

The possibility of opening the
Internship Office on a full-time basis
“looks _really good,” Student

Government Board member Mindy.

Goldberg said at last week’s meeting
of the board. ,

Members ofthe University Senate
Educational Policies Committee
and the Budget Policies Committee
formed a sub-committee to look into
reopening the office full-time out of
the Provost's Office. The fact alone
that this is being done is a positive
one, Goldberg said. _

“What this means, in essence, is if
senate committees come out in favor
of having [the office open] full-time
out of the Provost's Office, they're
interested in it," she said. “The fact
that they have done this shows their
interest. If they didn’t think it was
relevant, they wouldn’t have
bothered. '

“I was told that one of my stum-
bling blocks might be an inability to
get input on the part of the faculty
and administration. That’s not what
I'm finding."

In other board business, after
weeks of deliberation, the board
voted 5-2 to reject the recommenda-
tion by the Allocations Committee
not to fund the Writers’ Conference,
and the amount of money it is given
will be decided directly by the board.

Voting to reject the recommenda-
tion were Dan Lecce, Kathy Brown,
Ken Stram, Barry Greene and Jeff
Delmontagne. Mindy Goldberg and
Craig Murphey voted to accept the
recommendation.

An emergency request that was
passed unanimously was $520 for
the Campus Crusade for Christ's
annual trip to Kansas City. The
money will fund bus fare for four
members of the group.

The board is considering whether
it is in the position to take a stand on
international issues, such as U.S.
involvement in Lebanon and Gren-
ada. The discussion was prompted
at yesterday’s meeting by a request
by board member Jeff Delmontagne
for the board to endorse a petition
calling for the complete and imme-
diate withdrawal of U.S. forces from
those regions.

Repeat Offenders   .      
Students Having Trouble Making Grades

By RON SMUTNY

The rising number of students‘

whoimust repeat a course — some-
times two and three times — in order
to proceed in their major, was dis-
cussed at Friday's meeting of the
College of Arts and Sciences (CAS)
Council.

CAS dean Irwin Schulman pre-
sented the council with estimates of
the number of students who must
repeat certain required courses —
particularly computer science and
mathematics classes.

Schulman estimated that 40 per-
cent of the students who take Intro-
duction to Computer Science
(Computer Science 7) receive a

grade of C- or lower and must repeat _

in order to continue in the major. Of
that 40 percent, it is estimated that

— only 25 percent do actually take the

course again. Of that group, I0 per-
cent must repeat the course a third
time. Similar percentages apply to
Analytic Geometry and Calculus I

(Math 22),which is taken by nearly
two-thirds of all CAS students.

Schulman said that the figures are
only estimates because the univer-
sity has nocomputerized system for
knowing how many times a student
has repeated a ‘course.

Both Schulman and the council
agreed that a formal rule on repeat-
ing a course may not be the answer
but that more attention should be
given to the problem by the respec-
tive departments and advisers.

_ “A lot of people taking these
courses lack the necessary work hab-
its,” Schulman said. “People delude

-themselves into thinking they can

pass [Math 22].”

Other problems surrounding the
computer science courses were dis-
cussed by the council, including the
recent “sleep-out” by students want-
ing to register for certain classes.

Schulman said that he is working
with the Registrar’s Office to elimi-
nate the problem of shortages of
class space in computer science

Pitt Dean Asked
To Resign Office

By PEGGY FERRI

Pitt assistant dean- for academic
affairs, Dr. Robert E. Olson, has
been asked to resign from his posi-
tion, but the reasons for the action
are not clear.

Dr. Donald Leon,_dean of Pitt’s
School of Medicine, made" the
request on Friday citing “academic
incompatability and a difference in
management philiosophy" as the
major reasons, according to a Nov.
I2 article in The Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette. Neither Leon nor Olson
could be reached for comment.

Pitt associate professor of bio-
chemistry Dr. Robert H. Glew, how-
ever, claims there is more to the
request.

“Olson is being fired because he

was getting very close to the practice
plans,” Glewsaid. “They [the prac-
tice plans] are the evil at the root of
Pitt’s problems.”

According to Pitt assistant profes-
sor of biochemistry Stephen Phil-
lips, practice plans are a way of
integrating private practice and aca-
demic life. Physicians. and others

increase the number of spaces avail-

able for the more popular computer‘

courses. He stressed that shortages
of resources — faculty and equip-
ment — especially in the areas of
computer graphics and microcom-
puters, are the major cause of the
overcrowding problem. 5
“We must -respond to
demand,” Schulman said.
The council alsodiscussed a com-
puter literacy requirement, but
Sch_ulman said that such a discus-
sion will have to wait until the pre-
ceeding problems are eliminated.
“Before we mandate [computer]
literacy, we must make it possible
for thestudents seriously interested
to get the courses they need,” Schul-
man said.
In other action, the council
announced that: -

Advising Changes With Student Needs

By JON WILLIAMS

Standing in line for over an
hour to register for classes, only
to find that they are closed, is one
of the many problems with
undergraduate advising at Pitt
that face students.

The director of the College of
Arts and Sciences, Frederick
Koloc, said there were many
problems with the advising ses-
sions that were held in the past,
but the system has gotten better.

“Some [advisers] used to push
the departments they were in,
now they might say ’here are the
courses needed to fill class
requirements. Which would you
like to take?” he said.

The new requirements for gra-
duation have helped put a stop to

the abuses of the past, Koloc

said, because students must take
a variety of courses. While they
are doing that, they can decide
what course they want to concen-
trate on. Advisers cannot coerce
a student into taking straight
major requirements.

Some other area colleges have
their own systems of advising —
some similar to Pitt’s, soiiie com- '
pletely different.

Carnegi_e-Mellon University,
for example, has a system that is
the opposite of Pitt’s system.

According to Brad Walters,
dean of student affairs at CMU,
the first two years of college are
filled with straight required
courses, no matter what the stu-
dents’ intended course of study ,
will be. So students are not
advised, they are directed. It is
the professors, he said, who

-advise students as to what direc-
tion they should follow.

advisers to see students imme-

“The ‘core of courses’ is pretty
well laid out,” Walters said. “The.
students have to pick out the
times and set their schedules.”

Duquesne University, on the
other hand, has a system quite
similiar to Pitt’s. Students can -
select from a number of courses
and have to fulfill the credits for
an intended major. The major
difference between Pitt’s and"
Duquesne’s systems is that
Duquesne maintains an open-
door policy of advising, } said ~
Cindy Carter, secretary of
Duquesne CAS advisement.

“If a student needs help with
selecting a course, they generally
can come in right away to see an
adviser,” she said.

At Pitt, the availability of

diately was rare under the old
system. A student had to make

Becoming A Worker-Writer

By-DEBORAH NICHOLS

Socialist and feminist Meridel Le
Sueur,’ still a productive writer and
an ardent speaker at age 83, read
from her work last’ Tuesday after-
noon in a crowded classroom in the
Cathedral of Learning. The reading
was sponsored by the history depart-
ment and the women's studies and
writing programs.

Le Sueur lived many of “the great
struggles in America," which she
said, are too“ often slighted in history
textbooks. Involved with the social-
ist and labor movements since her
childhood, Le Sueur knew such his-
torical figures as Eugene Debs,
Helen Keller, John Reed, Emma
Goldman and Alexander Berkman.

- Their influence and her growing

concern with the .“muteness” of

_ working people, especially women,

helped Le Sueur shape her commit-

‘ ment to become a worker-writer.

Having left home — and school -4
in her teens, Le Sueur has been a
working woman nearly all her life.
She supported herself and her two
daughters. during the Depression
and afterwards with many kinds of
work, always continuing to write.

Le Sueur was blacklisted during
the McCarthy era. Not only was
much of her controversial work not
published, she was also repeatedly
harrassed, spied upon and fired
from subsistence jobs. She con-

tinued to write for socialist publica—_

tions, and she drew material for
widely-published children's books
from the history of her native

I Midwest.

In the l970’s, Le Sueur was redis-
covered by the women‘s movement.
Calling herself “Mrs. Lazarus," Le
Sueur explains, “The people I was
writing for in the 305 were born." In
I982, The'Feminist Press published
“Ripening: Selected Work, I927-

cia Lorca’s charge to the poet to
return to the people their own
images, strengthened and beauti-
fied. Le Sueur said her imagescome
from “oppressed people [now] rising
out of silence," including women
and the Third World.

“The writer and the intellectual
have the responsibility to emphasize
new images," she said. .

From women come images ‘of
nourishing, according to Le Sueur.

“If men were nourishing, they
wouldn’t be eliminating the earth."

Harmony of the human and natu-
ral world, and the cyclical nature of
process, are images drawn from the
American Indian cultures with
which Le Sueur strongly identifies
her later work.

Le Sueur believes such themes are
reinforced by new scientific theories

_the alienated object,

  

and discoveries. As a young student,
she was taught a mechanistic physics
and biology. But, she said,»“The new
science is an open door to the new
reality of matter...what is real is not
it's the
relationship.”

The adoption of new images
requires the rejection of the old,
“paralysing, cynical, disruptive"
images and linear thinking that
devolve from a capitalistic, patriar-
chal system, she said. In this context,
she believes that educational institu-
tions can be “dangerous."

“Learning should be true and use-
ful,” Le Sueur said. But in schools, it
is often “fragmented and manipula-

tive,” its development not spontane-

ous but already prescribed.

“You can't be a maverick or a free-
thinker, can you?" she asked.

Le Sueur is critical of many ofthe
artists and intellectuals of her own
generation. She describes the I923
publication of T. S. Eliot’s “The
Wasteland" as “the tragic event of
my lifetime,” and reviles philoso-
phies of existentialism and aliena-
tion as “the poison of my
generation."

Le Sueur countered these influen- ,

ces in her own life by connecting her
writing and her social activism. She
recommends, “Stay close to what’s
happening. That’s where you get
your energy in life.”

"It is also the source of hope that
allows Le Sueur to see the poten-
tially terrifying crises ofthe l980’s as
a great opportunity.

“There must be a new reality, or
we'll all be destroyed,” she said.

She doesn‘t underestimate the
power of what she frankly calls “the
enemy" — “the mad adventurers
who want to blow up the world" —
or the difficulties of working outside
the system and “of resisting its
inducements. But looking back on a
lifetime of struggle andvsurvival, she
says, “this is the most hopeful time
of my life."  ~.~. . 4

Meridel Le Sueur will return to
Pitt on Wednesday, Nov. I6, to par-
ticipate in a-Contemporary Writers
Series programon Walt Whitman.
The program will begin at 8 p.m. in
Room 501, Cathedral of Learning.

  

We save your

By JOE SEMANICK

The “Great Pitt—Penn State
Blood Challenge,” which began
on Nov. I and will continue until
Nov. I7, is fully under way.

The blood challenge, spon-
sored by the Central Blood Bank
of Pittsburgh and the American .
Red Cross of ‘Johnstown, is an
attempt to recruit alumni, stu-
dents, faculty, staff and other
supporters of Pitt and Penn
State to donate blood.

The school that receives the
most votes will be presented with
an award at the game on Nov. I9
by Barry Stern, the secretary of
labor and industry of
Pennsylvania.

So far, donations have been
fairly steady with an average of
200-300 daily. As of Nov. 9, Pitt
had 2,547 votes and_is leading '
Penn State, .which had 2,340
votes. ' ’ ‘

“I am thrilled with the results
so far; however,even though Pitt
is leading right now, I’m sure that
Penn State won’t give up without
a fight. The battle is going to be
close, but I think Pitt can win if
everyone who possibly can
donates,” John Olijarr of the
Central Blood Bank said.

When asked about the impor-
tance to the bank of drives such
as this, Olijarr replied, “The’chal-
lenge is a fun and exciting way to
induce and stimulate members of
the local community to give
blood; however, the bottom line
is saving lives. One donation can
save up to three lives.”

“This drive is very important
to the bank. We’re a- non-profit
organization affiliated with 38 z
area hospitals. Because we must

fill the needs of Pittsburgh’s‘

’ because

Blood Drive Continues

active medical community, our
demand for blood is above the
national average.”

“Right now, our blood supply
is stable," Olijarr said. “But
our demands are
increasing each day, local citi-
zens must continue supporting -

_ the blood bank if we are to meet

area needs." .

Mary Ann Spontinato of the
American Red" Cross in John-
stown said, “We at the Red Cross
share the same beliefs as the
blood bank. We are working
closely with the bank in trying to
stimulate community responsi-
bility and in trying to accumulate
as much blood as possible.”

-“The slogan of the blood drive
is, ‘Everyone wins when you give
blood.’ We win.»'The patients
win; but more importantly, the
donor wins. Not only does he get
the satisfaction of knowing- that
he is helping save lives, but in
addition, he is able to ‘voice his
support for his favorite college
and team.”

As part of Greek Week, stu-
dents also have the option of vot-
ing.for their favorite fraternity,
sorority or residence hall. So far,
435 Greek votes have been
received, with Delta Tau Delta

‘ahead of the other fraternities
, and sororities; Tower A is ahead

of the other residence halls.

Anyone interested in donating
blood can stop in at the Central
Blood Bank or visit one of the
following on-campus donation
sites:-Nov. I4, Benedum Hall, 10-
4:45 in the first-floor snack
room; Nov. I5, Benedum Hall or

-By KATHLEEN L. KASHAY

Judy Goldsmith, president ofthe
National Organization for Women
used the annual Pennsylvania NOW
convention, held in Pittsburgh last
weekend, as an opportunity to join
her. NOW constituents in a cam-
paign to oust President Ronald Rea-
gan from the White House in next
year’s elections. A

Goldsmith and the other promi-
nent NOW officials who spoke at the
Saturday session attacked Reagan
and the Republican party for pur-
posefully holding back women and
stymying the ratification of the
Equal Rights Amendment..

The convention, which ran
through Sunday evening, began on
Saturday morning with a satirical
skit which poked fun at women
opposed to the ERA.and to NOW.

The skit featured three women
farcically representing the “Com-
mittee for Unborn Republicans”
and a cheerleader who led the
audience in a chant of “Keep our
nation on the track! One step for-
ward and three steps back!”

The early levity was followed by
speeches which concentrated on the
power of women in the voting booth
in next year's national elections and
NOW’s goal to vote Reagan out of
office.

Vickie Monrean, regional direc-‘

by saying that NOW is going to

repression of women."

Going on to speak of the ERA,
Monrean said that ”where inequal-
ity exists,__there is no freedom. I
promise that we will not settle for
less than the best from ourselves and
from our government." Monrean
said that through the concerted
efforts of NOW the “ERA will be
ratified, and it damn well will be
ratified in our life time." . E

Sara B. Clavez, president of the
Pennsylvania NOW, followed Mon-
rean with a speech on why NOW
should become more political on a
nationwide basis. Clavez
approached her theme by asking the
audience “What kind of impact do
we want to have on our country? Do
we want to be another special inter-

nity, equality and pleasure" political
clout would be necessary, according
to Clavez. She stated that to do this,
NOW would “have to out-fundraise,
-campaign and-lobby the anti-
women forces,” and NOW would
“play by their rules."

Speaking after Clavez, Goldsmith
also emphasized the need for NOW
to be a politically-active
organization. ~

Goldsmith said that the philo-

_ sophy that power corrupts has been

instilled in the average person to
keep him from striving for power
over his own life and that NOW
must overcome this idea and “take
power and use it responsibly to
achieve our goals.“

only on rare occasions could he
see an adviser before that time.

This is changing, Koloc said.
Pitt advisers are seeing more stu-
dents than they have in previous
years. He attributes this to the
advisers themselves.

“They are all grad students.
Normally they are supposed to
put in about 16 hours a week,” he
said. “This year many are putting
in 20 or 22 hours, not counting
the time-they may put in seeing
students during lunch hours or
free time."

Students are able to see advis-
ers on shorter notice and
although the appointment for
registration .is,\ still neccessary,

emergency situations are consi-
dered.

“The problem is never as
serious as the student thinks it
is," Koloc said. “In emergencies,
we judge it on whatjhe really
needs; we’re then willing to make
a judgement.”

Freshman Barney Veres said
he was pleased with his adviser;
but he would like the advisers to
explain the classes in more detail.

Koloc said he would like the
students to have their courses
and several alternatives picked
out before they see their adviser.

“I get frustrated when the stu-
dent hasn’t read the course des-
cription,” he said. “Then they
expect us to get them all the times

Some students do not have the
option of scheduling classes.
Vicki Tulenko, an engineering
student, found her adviser help-
ful, but her course selections very
confined. ~

“Right now, I have no elec-
'tives. I would like to drop some
of the required courses for more
variation,” she said. - '

Koloc said that many students
may be disappointed with the
performance ofthe Pitt advisers.

"I know it’s not the ideal sys-
tem,” he said, “but an increase in
the number of advisers would
result in the shortening of the

ment elections coming up next year,
Goldsmith said that “l984" is going
to be the year of women in politics. It
is time to open the door behind
which so many qualified women
have stood for years and put them in

o the positions of power.“

Goldsmith said that NOW’s
“Major political responsibility in
l984 is to remove Ronald Reagan
from office.“ The audience demon-
strated its agreement with Golds-
mith on this point through a
standing ‘ovation during which it
chanted “Reagan remember, we
vote in November."

Reagan's overseas policy, particu-
larly the recent invasion of Grenada,
was attacked by Goldsmith, who
said, “Women are disgusted with his
cavalier attitude towards the lives of
human beings. Women are not
simply going tocheer the boys on as
they march off to war because they
[women] know what happens."

Goldsmith then commented on
Reagan’s political stance on
women’s issues. She said that “Rea-
gan has plunged women into back-
ward movement. His policies and

page“: -

program funding are against
women."

Reagan and the Republican
party, Goldsmith said, are ot only
working to stop the ERA but are
trying to lesson it's importance by
their amendments to it concerning
abortion, insurance premiums and
homosexuality. Goldsmith is not
daunted by this, though, and
claimed, “We will have a clean Equal
Rights Amendment."

Eleanor Curti Smeal, immediate
past president of NOW and a Mount
Lebanon resident who was instru-
mental in forming the Pennsylvania
NOW, followed Goldsmith at the
podium, where she emphasized the
power women have at the polls. .

Smeal said that even though
women are made to feel insignifi-
cant, it is women who will vote the

next United States president into - P

office. She backed this up by telling

. the audiences that “More women are

registered, and more women vote in
every election. Men are voting less
and less, and women are voting
more and more." -

More Than
A Motion

I S Women in politics have been in the media lately
because of recent events that have put them there.
The Rev. Jesse Jackson has said he is seriously
considering having a woman as a running mate if he
receives the Democratic nomination for president next
summer. ’
Last weekend’s state convention of the National

Organization of Women (NOW) spent a large part of-

the time debating the pros and cons of a woman vice-
president; and last week’s off-year election put women
in power all across the nation, including the election of
a woman governor in Kentucky.

Elections are usually the focus of many news reports
whenever a woman, a black or any other minority is
involved.

Having a woman as a vice-president would mean

‘great strides for feminism and the country in general.
It would show a departure from the norm and be quite
commendable for a nation that did not give women the
vote until I920 and has failed to pass the Equal Rights
Amendment.

But we are left to wonder if the promises of Jackson
and some other Democratic candidates who are think-
ing about a woman running mate are sincere or ifthey
are just spouting off.

A woman running-mate ofa presidential hopeful at
this time would probably be a token effort installed to
get the votes of liberals and the endorsements of such
groups as NOW.

If the Democrats and the Republicans are so inter-
ested in getting women involved in American politics,
they should be encouraging women to run for the
Senate, governorships, mayorships and other offices
that have power and decision-making qualities.

We are also left to wonder ifthere is a woman in this
country who is qualified enough to handle the vice-
presidency. While women have made great strides in
politics in the past decade, there are still only a handful
of women in the U.S. Senate. Both parties that.are
interested in women being in politics should start at
the beginning and help women get elected to positions
where they will do some good. “

Having a woman as a vice-presidential candidate
might also do some harm for the Democratic party in
itself. It would be somewhat idealistic to think that
America has thrown away all its sexist attitudes and
will vote for a candidate who has a woman running-
mate. The vote may come down to being anti-women
instead of a well-thought—out vote.

The Democrats, and any other candidates who are
thinking about a woman as a vice-president. have.to sit
down and really think about their motivations and
consequences if they decide to act.

While it would be wonderful to have a woman on
the presidential ticket. the effort may turn out to be
nothing but a token effort and may even set women
behind in their fight for political equality.

Recognizing Peace Movement

_ By REGINA SOMMER

As early as February of this year,
the people of West Germany were
openly displaying their contempt for
the impending deployment of
nuclear missiles in Western Europe.
When the growing unrest became
evident across the entire nation, the
politicians began to express their
fears through a now well-known
phrase: “its gonna be a ‘hot fall.’ "

While the government prepared
for violence (special training ses-
sions for policemen, new uniforms
with padded vests, helmets with face
guards, shields, cars with iron bars
over the windows), most ofthe peace
groups‘ members were training for
civil disobedience. '

The motto for the fall actions was
Ghandi’s message of peacefulness
and civil disobedience as well as
Martin Luther I(ing’s sentence: “We
no longer have the choice between
violence and non-violence. We only
have the choice between non-
violence and non-existence."

The tension between the govern-
ment and two-thirds of the West
German population, who are critic-
izing the nuclear arms race, reached
its peak. when the minister of inte-
rior changed the demonstration law
and journalist, moderator and arms
race criticizer Franz Alt was banned
from TV by the Christian Demo-
cratics. Thousands protested against

Looking Up

By 1.9. MARRA

As my good friend Ron said to
me the other day, “Ifl were going
to open a restaurant, I‘d want to
hire a truckload of Vickies."

I guess I should explain,
Vickie is a service person at the
Roy's in the Cathedral of Learn- ’
ing. Most mornings find me
there before classes start, slur-
ping down that mandatory cup
or three of coffee. Out of habit, I
always head for Vickie’s line
when I arrive. She greets me with,
a big smile. says hello, has my
coffee ready before I can ask for
it, knows not to ask if I want
cream and sugar (I take it black).
makes a bit of small talk-and
wishes me a pleasant day. And
I'm just one of the hundreds of
people she serves every day.

Her job is a demanding one.
As former restaurant worker in a
college town. I have an idea of
what she puts up with every day.

those two incidents. Even the mass
newspaper Bild am Sonntag, which
is comparable to the National
Enquirer.

Specifically, the support of Alt
showed the government that the cri-
tique against the arms politics can
no longer be accused of having been
inspired by the communists. This
development could force a change in
the German security policy, and it
might start a process of rethinking
our principle. of parliamentary
majority.

Never before has a protest move-
ment put the political establishment
under such pressure.

A minority among the peace
movement appeals so strongly to its
own conscientious decisions that
there doesn‘t seem room for political
compromises. Members of the
church see the deployment of the
Pershing II as a sin against the Crea-
tor. The “peace hunters”justify their
actions with (higher) legitimation
against (lower) legality. From this
viewpoint.“resistance'f is the citi-
zens’ higher priority. As the author
Guenther Grasshas stated: “Should
it come to the deployment of the
missiles in Germany, only resistance
can help then.”

Long before the actual deploy-
ment date of the Pershing II and
cruise missiles, the protest against
the new weaponry changed the polit-
ical field in Germany.

rushes. people in a hurry, an
occasional rude customer and
students frazzled by the pres-
sures of university life. She
stands for maybe five or six
straight hours without a break.
She must constantly maneuver
-past her fellow workers so that
she can grab her order. And she
still manages to smile through all
this. I remember that I wasn‘t
nearly as cheerful to my custo-
mers; indeed, most people
wouldn't be. '

Well, there's a moral to all this.
If you believe in the spider-web
theory, which maintains that
ev_ery action in the universe
affects every object in some way.
then you might visualize the
effect Vickie has on the world
through being nice to her custo-
mers. If you don't buy that philo-
sophical bent. you still have a
hard time denying that if more
people in the world went out of

Before the Action Week (Oct. I5-
22), other rallies and solidarity
actions took place in Germany:

0At the beginning of October,
soldiers on duty and reserve army
members (among them several offi-
cers) demonstrated against the two-
track decision.

Oln Bonn, 6,000 physicians and
nurses in their uniforms walked
through the streets to show and
warn that there would be no medical
help in a nuclear war; while this rally
was in progress, American soldiers
in Hessen were trained to dig “mass
graves."

0560 government employees from
all ministries wrote a letter to Chan-
cellor Kohl to stop the deployment.

0Numerous meetings took place
among professional groups: “Artists
for Peace,” “Judges and Lawyers for
Peace,” etc.

0Women formed a chain of peace
along the Berlin Wall.

0Weapons.faciIities and factories
were encircled.

Although over 3 million people
joined in the demonstrations during
Action Week, there were only a few
violent incidents. Contrary to the
expectations of the politicians, the
“hot fall” was just another warm
autumn week.

As a result of the peaceful demon-
strations, the politicians have had to
recognize the legitimation of the
non-aligned peace movement in
West Germany.

 Rugby: A ContrastofFinesseandFierceness   if

The Pitt News, Monday, November ‘I4, I983

/ ‘Page 5 '

By JOHN GAMBESCIA

“Give Blood, ‘Play Rugby” is a
saying quickly learned by those who
participate in a sport which falls
somewhere between football and
soccer. The action is fast, and the
hitting is hard. lfa player thinks too
long about the last goal, he might

‘not walk off the field on his own.

Rugby football is a solid contact
sport that differs greatly from Amer-
ican football. It is played without
helmets or pads. No substitutions
are allowed, so a team with an
injured man must continue short-
handed until the player is revived or
patched-up. _

There are no time-outs. Play is“

continuous for two 40-minute
halves, with only a five-minute half-
time break, and the lack of protec-
tion, substitution and recovery time
has led many observers to question
the sanity of the rugby player._
“l’ve

years old,” said Shane Reihill, a Pitt
student and member of the Steel
City Rugby Club.

Reihill, who was born and raised
in a suburb of Dublin, Ireland, said
European rugby is much different
from U.S.-rugby.

“One of the tactics in rugby is to
release the ball before you get
tackled, but the U.S. rugger some-
times thinks you are more ofa man if

The University of Pittsburgh
Department of Music presents
Music of Africa, Thursday, Nov.
I7 at 8:30 p.m. at the Frick Fine
Arts Auditorium, Oakland.
Admission is complimentary.

Pitt’s I8-member African
Drumming "Ensemble, led by
graduate enthomusicology stu-
dent William Anku, will play
authentic African instruments.
The stories behind the music will

you get tackled first then release the
ball,” Reihill said.

Another major difference is the
size of the players.

“It is rare for a European team to
field more than three players who
are as big as a football defensive
end,” Reihill said. The European
players are much smaller and more
compact than the U.S. rugger, who
is often like a rolling mountain.

Reihill said the rules and tactics of
rugby changed many times before it
evolved into today’s version, and
even now, teams may have to agree
on certain rules before the game
begins.

The game of rugby was “acci-
dently" established in I823 during a
soccer match at Rugby School in
England. A schoolboy named Wil-
liam W. Ellis picked up a soccerball
and ran with it during a game. Since

the "rules of soccer football were_

somewhat vague at the time, Ellis’
teammates were not convinced that
he was in violation of the rules.
Thus, the game of football, as
played at Rugby School, was born.

As the rules changed, rugby in the A

U.S. became what we call football.
Terms such as offsides,.touchdown
and scrimmage all come directly
from rugby. V
“The rules were kind of confusing

at the beginning of the game but_

became a little clearer toward the
end,” said Joe Watkins, a semi-pro

football offensive end who recently
saw a game of rugby in Pittsburgh.

He said that what surprised him
the most was how hard players hit
each other. even without pads; but

he still thinks football is a harder-
hitting sport. ‘'
Rugby slowly fought its way back
to the U.S. and was included as a
sport inthe I924 and 1928 Olympics.
After the U.S.’ .w-inningfthe gold
medal both years, powerful rugby
nations such as England, Ireland

and France refused to compete in

the Olympics because they believed

I

it was against the nature ofthe game
to take the serious and physical atti-
tude that the Americans displayed.
The Europeans saw rugby as a sport
for enjoyment only, and soon after.

    

it was dropped as an Olympic sport. ‘
Rugby has been steadily growing‘

in popularity in the United States,
and it is played extensively on the
East‘ Coast. Western Pennsylvania
has brought together both cluband
collegiate teams and formed an
organization known asjthe Allegh-
eny Rugby Union. Competing in the
I4-team union are such teams as

Erie, South Pittsburgh, Penn State
and Steel City.

Scott Goodlin, vice president of
Steel City Rugby, recognizes the dif-
ference between U.S.\- and
European-style rugby.

“There is a lot more finesse in
European rugby," Goodlin said.
“We have some degree of skill, but
more emphasis -is placed .' on the
physical aspects of the game.

“Alot of people think we are crazy
because of what we do, but it's all a
part of the game, and we love every
second of it.” ,

Carl Krzywiec, a Pitt senior, also
plays for Steel City Rugby. Hisjob is
to score, and he takes that job
seriously.

“Just like any other sport, a lot of  J I

dedication goes into playing rugby,"

Krzywiec said. “Some people don't — 

even know what rugby is, but it is a
sport -that is growing larger and
more publicized every year."

He said one thing that has
remained unchanged since rugby
came to the U.S. is the post-game,
celebration. I

“ltis a on-going tradition for both-
teams to join in singing songs and
drinking beer after the game,” Krzy-

wiec said. “All the hard feelings are '

gone, and we just want to have a
good time. _

“ln rugby, sometimes, it’s not who
wins the game, but who wins the
party.”

future of private higher educa-
tion announced the formation
and funding of a new _national
organization, the Consortium

— institutional problems they face.
The goal is to develop a funding
base of at least $18 million over
the next few years.

One special interest of
CAPHE will’ be those high-
quality liberal arts colleges that
are at risk because of limited

endowments. The focus of the
program will be on six key areas:

There are some Pittsburgh
poets who are going to prison.‘
No, it’s not because of artistic
censorship. These poets are part
of.a program designed to teach

"inmates at Western Penitentiary

how to write poetry.

For nearly a decade, the Pitts-
burgh Poetry Exchange and the
Academy of Prison Arts have
encouraged inmates to develop
an understanding of and an
appreciation for poetry, said Ed
Ochester, an associate professor
of English at Pitt.

“Poetry is an art that is vital
and does communicate," he said.

= To demonstrate the art and
increase the communication in
the Pittsburgh area, Ochester is
reading from his works all this
month on Warner Cable. Joining

-Ochester is well-known poet

Etheridge Knight.

The reading was taped in July
1982 at the Fine Line Theatre.
The program includes readings
from Ochester’s books, “A-Drift
of Swine," “The End of the lce
Age: Poems," “Dancing on the

Edges of Knives: Poems" and ~_

other works.

The program is sponsored by

Poetry Finds New ModeOf Expression,

He will also be hosting a radio
series in the near future to be
called “Poets of Pennsylvania,”
which will be broadcast on
WQED-FM sometime this
month. Ochester will be inter-
viewing four or five poets from
the state, including Daniel Dusk,
a professor at Temple University
in Philadelphia. In addition to
the interviews, some ofthe guests
will also be reading their poetry.

Televised poetry and public
readings are very popular in
Pittsburgh, he said. He encour-
ages students and faculty to
attend any of the many readings
in Pittsburgh. For example, the
English department sponsors
poetry and fiction readings every
Tuesday night in the back room
of Hemingway’s. .

The readings are so popular
that when Gustine's was sold, the
new owners changed the name to
Hemingway’s because of the
Tuesdav Night Reading Series.

, “The readings at He'm1ngway’s
are very popular," Ochester said.
“People are turned down at the

I ‘door each week.-” The readings

start at'8:30 p.m.

Ochester jsaid. Readings also
enable the poet to te_st a word or a
line of which he is unsure by
watching the audience’s
response.

one knows how much money goes

operating budget.

Phillips said he cannot be certain
ifthe request for Olson’s resignation
was prompted by his views on Pitt’s
practice plans, but he did say there is
no question that “he [Olson] was not
liked by practice plan directors."

“It does seem to be a strange coin-3 '3

cidence,” Phillips said.

He added that he is also con-
cerned with what will happen to
efforts to rebuild Pitt's basic science
departments without Olson.
According to Phillips," Olson was
offered his position so that he would
aid Leon in this project. “The
quality of the basic sciences has
been declining,” Phillips said.

He attributed this to lack of sup-
port and failure to replace chairmen
when they resign. The department of

pharmacology is “decimated,” he '

said, and still lacks a chairman.

Panthers’ Attack Blitzes Army .38-7:

By MARK \A. SINDLER

lt’s getting a bit monotonous, but

,, Pitt football head coach Foge Fazio

doesn’t mind in the least.

In fact, if the Panthers reach
another turning point on Saturday
against long-time sorespot, Penn
State, Fazio will be anything but
bored to fragments.

For the third time in this most
unpredictable season, Pitt turned
yet one more corner and did so at the
expense of a ragged-looking Army
assemblage.

By leaving the Cadets in a deep-
freeze 38-7 at Pitt Stadium on Satur-

_ day, the Panthers hiked their record
 to 8-2 and won their sixth consecu-

tive game in preparation for a battle
between the dens featuring Penn
State. '

Also not lost in a game featuring
Pitt’s second-highest point output
this season is a 99 44/100 chance of
receiving a phone call from the
Fiesta Bowl folks. With Boston Col-
lege and Notre Dame, both
previous-leading candidates, losing
Saturday, Pitt is a likely nominee.
' “Everybody needs a game where
they can excel and feel really good
about it," said Pitt center Jim
Sweeney.

Though Sweeney was hard-
pressed to find a better Saturday
performance to top last week’s
against Notre Dame, an informal
consensus indeed read this as
another milestone game for the
Panthers.

Rebounding from two straight
losses with a win against Florida
State several weeks ago, eking out
two victories over Navy and Syra-
cuse and buttoning up the abound-
ing critics with a dog-fought win
against the Irishmen, Pitt clamped
down early and tight on Army.

Leading the way for the second
week in a row was tailback Joe
McCall, shopping for 246 yards on
36 carries — the fifth‘ best single-
game performance by any Pitt

‘rusher. -

Last Saturday, McCall gained 1 16
yards.

More to the point, though, was a
Pitt offensive line simply blowing an
Army line, whose largest lineman is
235 lbs., off the ball. ‘ _-

“Maybe I felt pretty good when I

heard [about the record],” McCall"

said, “but as a whole, it made me feel
a little better since it was a team
effort. The offensive line and full-
backs were blocking well; I have to
credit the whole team.” '

“It was their whole offensive line
that did the job today,” Army head
coach Jim Young said. “All day
long, they were blowing our defense
off the line of scrimmage." V

McCall put Pitt on the board first,

in ironic fashion, latching onto a 26-
yard TD pass 9:’54.into the game. On
the 82-yard drive, he picked up three
first downs.

A minute and a half later, after
defensive end Chris Doleman
slammed into Cadet quarterback
Rob Healy~'and recovered the fum-
ble on Army’s 20, Pitt QB John Con-
gemi ended a ﬁve-play series when

he lofted a seven—yard lob to tight '

end Clint Wilson.

Pitt left the halftime score at 17-0 ‘
the’

when Snuffy Everett split
uprights with a 31-yard_field goal
four minutes._ into the second
quarter. - ' . 2

McCall by then; had 133 yards,

‘surprising in itself since the halfiwas
"marred by fumbles, dropped passes”:
and stone fingers ‘brought on by the-

13-degree wind chill facto'r.,Pitt

’ alone committedveight such errors in

the game’s first 30 minutes, -Army
two, excluding the Doleman
recovery. - . - ‘

But Army never posedan honest
scoring threat as Healy failed to tip-

By gaining 246 rushing yards on 36 carries, Joe McCall entered his name in Pitt’s record books
with the fifth best single game performance ever.

if number 90 [tight end Mark Tri-
plett] came in, there would be a pass.
If number 81 [ Bill Woolf] came in,
there would be a double tight end
formation and they would run.
“They were most cooperative.”
For those diehards attending de-
spite the refrigerator conditions,
however, Army did abort Pitt’s shut-
out hopes when the Cadets drove 70
yards in "nearly five minutes in the
fourth quarter and scored on atwo-
yard sneak by Bill Turner, the
Cadets’ third quarterback used.
But that happened after McCall
figured he didn’t give his legs enough
punishment.
Again registering three first
downs on Pitt’s first drive in the
second half, McCall capped the 67-

yard attack with a nine-yard run off ‘

(who else?) tackle Bill Fralic at 9:28.

Three and a half minutes into the
fourth quarter, McCall toyed with
three first downs on an eight-play
drive and flew in three yards
untouched to put the Panthers
ahead 31-0.

Fazio then pulled McCall from
the game, a full days work
completed.

Pitt finished its scoring when
quarterback Chris Jelic, inserted
late in the third quarter, completed a
26-yard pass to split end Jeff Casper

_ at the 6:39 mark.

“I thought Joe McCall did a good
job picking his holes well,” Fazio
said. “He made good cuts and used
his blockers well."

“He picked his holes,” Sweeney
remarked. “We just blockedandlet
him go. He had faith in his line -
that’s what helped.”

McCall‘s confidence in the hulk-'

ing line before him brewed over on
the entire team. This is a Pitt team
that, except for its Louisville perfor-
mance, seemed destined to scratch
for points till the knuckles bloodied.

Ever since shutting out Temple on
Sept. 10, a Panther offense couldn’t
quiet the rumors that it was actually
running practice seesions out of a
molehill.

Scoring points took Herculean
efforts. .Hell, slogging through
quicksand was easier than pulling
out some of those wins. *

Lady Panthersundermine KS

By SCOTT DELLETT

There were few surprises at Trees
Pool on Friday afternoon as the
Lady Panther swim team defeated
Kent State, 92-48.

“We dominated the meet," coach _

David Belowich said. “It give us the
chance to see where we are as a
team.” « ‘
It was also a test to see how the
Lady Panthers could perform with-
out two of the best swimmers in Pitt
history — Jan Ujevich and Sue
Heon. The team is taking on a differ-

ent look this season —— no longer

relying on one or two outstanding
performers, the team’s success is

V based on the contributions of each

member. , _
“Instead of ‘having one or two
people _carrying the load, we can

Spread ll.a‘.'9“l1.<'1." Belowich saidg

“Ex7°é'ry'"o"iie"’"wi1l have to make a con-
tribution and accept their roles."
In one stretch, Pitt pulled ‘off

_seven consective wins and would

have pulled off 5more, \had the
remaining part ofthe meet (the exhi-
bitions) beencounted on the Lady

Panthers‘ final‘ score. Against the
Lady Flashes, freshmen and 'sopho~ ,

mores played an important part in

The inspirational victory over
Notre Dame last week held many

different perspectives for just as_

many Pitt football players. Now
thoughts are turning to an ensuing
matchup this Saturday with Penn
State. . V

For agmere moment, though, Pitt
head coach Foge Fazio reached
back int.o the mental vault holding
the recollections of this season’s 10
games, and withdrew something
nearing the value of a banknote.
Valuable, atleast, to a Panther foot-
ball squad that was headed for a 4-7

season before plying its trade on the ' I

gridiron.
“Before going out and playing

Notre Dame last week,” Fazio said, -

“I had a great feeling about Joe
McCall. Today, before the game, I
passed by him, smiled, and he
smiled back.” -
The way Fazio talked of these
glances, one would think someone’s
wife just had a healthy newborn.
After Fazio lit that sagacious light
bulb, Pitt tailback Joe McCal-l went
out into Notre Dame Stadium and
plowed ahead for l 16 rushing yards.
For the 6-1, 190-lb. senior,‘ hitting
the century mark couldn’t have

come at a more opportune point in ,

the season. .

True, it could have come earlier,
while Pitt fell injurious to a two-
game losing dive, but now is when
the consistent trailblazing is most
needed.

Now, when it is time to avenge
48-14 and 19-10 losses to Penn
State.No'w, when bowl bids are
ﬂashed around as haughtily as plas-
tic money.‘ _

McCall 5 continued digging up

plastic grass by running rampant for .

246 yards on 36 carries over Army
Saturday. Only the third Pitt back
to‘ peak
McCall needed a telescope to pin-
point his last 100-yard-plus game
before Notre Dame. "

‘Lo and behold, that came against _

Army in 1982, for 129 yards on 24
carries. . 1

But now McCall isbalanced ‘on
the same wavelength as the team,
heading toward its ninth straight
bowl appearance. »- - A

“I was thinking the same thing
coach Fazio was thinking,” ‘McCall
cracked. “He gave me the thumbs-
up. I guess we were in agreement
with what both of us were thinking.”

Nothing of that sort neared either
person when the Panthers started,
their season at
September. -

McCall entered the new year
slated as the No. 1 starting tailbac/k.
After the 13-3 victory, though, aspi-

rations of carrying on-in that capac- .
ity floundered. Besides suffering ‘

Not A Good Sign: Spikers Flattened By PSU>

By LAURIE KUBLI

UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. —
Shelton Collier stood in the parking
lot ofa convenience store, protected
from the cold wind by a navy blue
van with a flat tire, and waved to his
players as they drove away in black
taxis. It was nearing 5:30 Saturday
nig~ht,_and the women‘s volleyball
team was expected in 20 minutes at
Penn State's Rec Hall gym, five
miles away.

After changing the flat tire, Col-
lier arrived in the blue and white
gym barely 20 minutes before game
time. Although Pitt, the underdog,
would not be late getting started in
the first game, the team would play
four games, each as different from
the others as a volleyball match is
likely to produce.

The team was headed for its sea-
son ﬁnale against the nationally
ranked Lady Lions. It was a rematch
of the battle waged nearly two
months , ago when Penn State
attended the Pitt Classic and

V defeated the Lady Panthers, who

had lost both their setters to injuries.

The spikers have looked forward
to this weekend's meeting ever since,
remembering the loss with bitter-
ness, remembering the rivalry that is.
nearly always unpredictable, and
remembering Penn State‘s ranking
among the nation's top colleges.

Pitt had ample motivation going
into this match-, but somewhere
along the line, something. went
wrong.

The visitors led halfway through
the first game, but lost 9-15. Pitt
again led in game two by scores of
7-l and l3—l0, but had difficulty
gaining game point. It would
become a duel of endurance, each
team determined in its own way to
win this match, a game notto be
soon forgotten by the 200 fans in
attendance at the East‘s top rivalry,
nor by the players and coaches.

The Lady Lions reached l5. first,
but had to win by two, so play went

on. When the score reached I6-lo,
the teams broke each other's service
so often that nearly seven minutes

passed before Pitt broke‘ the ice and
took the slim lead. l7—l6. Pitt could
not score the next point, but finally
won the tug of war with 2| points to
the home teams l9.

“It's tough to win at Penn State
for various reasons," Collier said.
“Winning in that pressure situation
was a good sign for our young team,
a sign that the team is growing.”

The effort in the previous game
seemed to drain the Lady Panthers,
who looked as if the only thing they
wanted was for this third game to be
over. It was, in short order, as Penn
State scored l3 unchallenged points
before Pitt could muster one. Pitt
plunged l—l5 under the Lady Lion
attack led by middle blocker Lori
Barbarich.

ln game four, Pitt seemed not to
have escaped the clutches of what-

when the school work starts getting to you, takea V
break and relax at Sera-Tec, where you make A

ever force had enslaved them to
ineptitude, falling behind 6—l3. A
recovery thought impossible by
some ‘members of the audience
brought them to within one point at
l2—l3, but Penn State held on to win
l5—l2.

Disappointment, as bitter as the
night was cold, lay heavily on the
Pitt bench. The Lady Lions left their
arena with a national ranking intact,
and smug with the satisfaction
gleaned from two wins over their
arch-rival in one season.

“In comparison to the outstand-
ing success of previous Pitt volley-
ball teams, 27-l0 and a loss to Penn
State is disappointing,” Collier
remarked. “But our regular season is
over, and today we begin our cham-
pionship season.”

and readying for the championships
this weekend in Providence, has

loss to the Lady Lions was witnessed
by Providence, which is 37-9 and
closing in on Pitt.

The ever—confident Collier had
suffered a letdown, but, as he pre-
dicted Friday, it was only tempor-
ary. “If we win the Big East
championship, this team still has the
chance to become the most success-
ful Pitt volleyball team.” he
remarked.

“We can accomplish this by win-
ning in the first round of the
NCAA’s,”said Collier. “That would
put us in the top l6 in the nation.

Hopefully. we can channel some of -

that disappointment into a concen-
trated preparatory effort for our
championship season."

The Pitt News, Monday, November 14, 1983

Hello, Joe Answers The Call  

«continued from page nine

McCall had a hard time getting
past this phase, however. No atti-

‘ tude problem here. Just a conflict in
nailing down consistency.

To complicate matters, he pulled
a calf muscle in Pitt’s home opener
against Temple. Now McCall
couldn’t even muster an attempt to
adjust to this alternating business.

Things were not looking up for

“McCall when Scales got his first
start in the West Virginia game. It
wasn’t that Scales earned it; neces-
sity forced the move.

But all was not lost, although
McCall might have differed at the
time. A Florida State game beck-
oned, and with eight and a half min-
utes remaining, McCall emerged
with a dozen bursts through the line
to seal a l7-I6 victory.

He didn’t score a touchdown dur-
ing those I2 runs, but it all added to
a total of 96 yards on 18 handoffs.

After several more games in the

,;,;evolving door, McCall played an

‘entire game for the first time, at
Notre Dame. T

“Alternating, that’s the key,”
McCall said. “I have to be in the
games and I always wasn’t. I haveto

get the ball 20 to 25 times to be ‘

effective.

“I’m not taking anything away
from anyone else, but it’sjust a mat-
ter of how much I can do.”

McCall came to Pitt in l98l, a
greenhorn from Miami, Fla.
Coaches stuck him at tailback and
he gained 453 yards on I05 carries.

For the next two years he did
some understudying at fullback,
and the stats explain why that
experiment did not pan out.

As a sophomore, McCall gained
only I79 yards, and last year pulled
in 385. He had 30 more carries the
last two years than during I980.

“lt’s been a learning experience,"
McCall said after grabbing Bryan
Thomas’ vacated position this year.
“l’ve learned a lot and matured into
a better football player who’s
learned to have patience with his

V blockers.”

The maturity has done wonders
for Pitt’s current leading running

back. After shredding Army to pie-
ces, McCall has now accumulated
708 yards rushing on 142 attempts.

The hypothetical vise-like grip

around his neck has now
disappeared. '
“I didn’t feel any pressure,"

McCall said of the season's earlier
performances. “I knew seven guys
up front were quite talented and one
is the best in_the country.

“Plus the fullbacks make the
blocks, I just follow them.”

As he did two days ago.

“They played great,” he con-
tinued. “The way [the fullbacks]
were opening . holes out there, I
couldn’t have done it without
them."

Momentum is now falling into
place for McCall, but he is not quick
to forget that the previous weeks
held as much misfortune as his own
running.

“Our consistency as an offense is
increasing as is our ability to sustain _'
drives,” he said. “We’re‘ making the
right blocks and doing the right
things an offense is supposed to do."

Joe McCall scored two rushing TDs and caught a TD pass to
almost slnglehandedly dispose of Army.

“it was a real good game," Con-
gemi said after passing for 95 yards
on nine of l8 attempts. “Its nice to
have a win like this. lt’s a nice victory
because we showed‘ we could put
points on the board.

“We knew we could do some. _
things that, in the past, haven’t been"-'

going our way.”

“We just wanted to prove to ev-
eryone we could score points,”
offensive guard Barry Pettyjohn
said. “Really, all that matters is it‘s a
win. It doesn’t matter how we got it.”

“A game like this makes us look

rgood and feel good,” Sweeney

added. “We had good play selection;
it just makes us feel real good.”
Fazio, in an equal mood, watched
as his squad came together for what
easily passes for the third time this

season. He did express a glum attiﬁ.

tude, though, now that the current ‘

scheduling contract with Army has
expired with no resumption sighted
yet.
Obviously, many a coach dreams

of playing Armies to fatten the

record.
“I was pleased with the effort, of

course,” he said on Saturday. “We

moved the ball very well early in the

game. Our passes downﬁeld were,
right on the money today. On the’

touchdown passes, we had two
receivers wide open, and the quar-
terback could have at least thrown
an alley-oop to-, either one.”

To the star of the game, this win
meant much more.

It signalled the start ofa readiness
nearing the alert stage on 'Pitt’s
opposition barometer.

“We were looking at this as a big
game,” McCall said of Army. “I

know Penn State will be a big one,?%:?’

but if we had a bad game today, we
wouldn’t be anything against Penn
State.” ,

GRID BITS: The flanker unit
seems to be a lost tribe since Dwight
Collins injured his ankle two weeks
ago; Matt Stennett caught only one
pass against Army for. l6 yards....
split end Bill Wallace suffered dia-
rrhea cramps Friday night and was
used sparingly by the coaches,
though he did grab three passes for
34 yards....He now leads the team in
both departments....Fazio is still
edgy over his kicking specialists-
....Though Pat Viancourt handled
all kickoffs and Everett all PATs
and a field goal, . Viancourt did
shank a 42-yard field goal at the end
of the first half....Pitt has now
defeated Army’ l()_ consecutive
times..;.The Pitt defense still has not
surrerndered a TD in the third quar-
ter.....Pitt outrushed Army 400-
l44....There were no interceptions in
the game....Fazio, now I7-5 after the
Army victory, is tied with former
head coach‘Jackie Sherrill for most
victories by a Pitt second-year head -
coach.
