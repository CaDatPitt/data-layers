Predicts Success

For Fine Arts Movie

By ROBERT RUTTENCUTTER

‘As we sat before the pro-
jector ‘ the other day watching
the first takes of the latest Pitt

movie unroll, most of us saw

success on‘ the screen.

’ I don’t' mean box office suc-
cess, though. Because “Fresh-
man Theme,” being produced un-
der direction of the ﬁne arts de-

partment, features Marlene Diet-

rich in the cast, and Paramount
deﬁcits show that only ushers
have seen'Dietrich pictures in the
last four years.

But the ﬁlm should be a success

‘Artistic’ Achievement
artistically. This is, we believe
it will clearly depict a hectic day
in the life of the typical freshman
-—from cutting his face, shaving,
and splashing grapefruit  his
eye in the morning, until he re-
turns from school, a changed boy,
with an idea for his overdue Eng-
lish theme.

In between, the English depart-
ment, who concocted the scenario
after Observing several thousand
theme loving freshmen, has ﬁlled
in a story of humor, pathos, de-
spair, and rejuvenation. That’s
covering quite a bit of psychology
in 20 minutes of ﬁlm, but with a
cast like Marlene Deitrich, Earl
Riley, Beverley Childress, Edna
Kauffman, Dr. E. A. Wolfe, and
William W. Mendenhall, the thing
ought to have lots of pathos, any-
way.

We are depending on Riley for
the humor, and so far he has
come through nicely. In fact
Riley will probably win a gold
“Oscar” just for his interpreta-
tion Of a yawn in the opening se-
quence. One more yawn like that,
and Riley will be lying on a table
while a surgeon ﬁshes for our $80
closeup lens. ’

Small Budget

If “Freshman Theme” is a hit,
it will be in spite of a production
budget that is smaller than a fra-
ternity house proﬁt. While, in
Hollywood, a symphony orchestra
gets the actors in the proper
mood, we just whistle while we
work. And out west, some stu-
dios have two or three acres of
Civil war generals’ uniforms, and
maybe a couple of thousand blue-
striped overalls. The other day,
we lost 15 minutes while Riley
looked for_his tie.

And although even Monogram
has people to stop traffic while
they are shooting street scenes, a
bus stopped smack in front of our
camera th_e other afternoon, while
Riley got off a street car on the
other side, completely hidden.

On the second take of this
scene, a cloud rolled in front of
the sun. uWe are told conﬁden-
tially that even M—G-M has this
trouble. ‘

Elliott Directs

Our total loss for the afternoon
was two carchecks and 15 feet of
ﬁlm. Since then, the Fine Arts
department has cut the budget.
Riley must now provide his own
carfare.

Despite these typical difficul-
ties, “Freshman Theme” is about
one-third photographer. Credit
for this progress should go to
Philip C. Elliott, who is deftly
guiding an inexperienced staff
through the innumerable compli-
cations of movie making.

And two weeks or more from
now, when the last “Cut!” has
been heard, and scene No. 118 has
been spliced into place, you will
see a real campus movie, written,
photographed, acted, and edited
by Pitt students.

To Graduating

Seniors

Each year, the administra-
tion orders engraved com-
mencement announcements to
send to other colleges and uni-
versities. This is merely a
formal announcement of the
time and place of the com-
mencement exercises, and does
not contain the names of‘ the
members of the graduating
class.

For the convenience of the
graduates, we have ordered a
limited quantity of these an-
nouncements. They will be on
sale, while the supply lasts, at
the University Bookstore, at
75 cents per dozen.

PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA, MONDAY, MAY 9, 1938

Owl Staﬁ‘ To

 

Subscription Copiesl

Students To Call
For Yearboola: ,
This Afternoon

By IRVING BENNETT
About 1100 copies of the 1938
Owl will be released today to
subscribers, according to an an-
nouncement by Idella R. Rome,
Ed38, editor of the yearbook,

and Samuel ‘\Verlinich, BASS,‘

business rna.nager.

Books will be distributed
from the conference room, eighth
floor Cathedral, starting at one
o’clock. Subscribers will be re-
quired to show their receipts and
to complete whatever payments
to be made. Dental, medical, and
pharmacy students will receive
their books at the school offices.

‘PICTORIAL REVIEW’

It takes 345 pages for the 1938
Owl to tell its story, with the
greater proportion of the space
utilized to display photographs,
giving a pictorial review of the
year. Forming the front and back
cover pages are color photomon-

tages of phases of University life.

Opening the books are sections
dealing with the administrators,
deans, department heads, and per-
sonnel directors. Several pages
take up the photographic story of
two seniors from the time of their
entrance to the University until
the day they receive their sheep-
skins. On the next 28 pages are
shown individual photographs of
the seniors.

Following this the Owl devotes
some pages to the schools of den-
tistry, education, engineering and
mines, medicine, pharmacy, and
the evening division, with their
graduating classes shown. Or-
ganizations are described next,
with the publications coming in
for candid camera review.

CANDID SPORTS

The candid camera men seem
to have worked overtime in pre-
paring the pages on University
athletics, one of the outstanding
divisions of the 1938 Owl. The
pictures are informal, but detailed
and thorough in their coverage of
sports.

Another well-covered division
is that headed “Pitt Life,” show-
ing the social, life, and dances of
the University year. Chairmen of
the affairs are pictured with their
companions. Completing the book
are the pages dealing with the
nominees to the Hall of Fame.

Photography for the yearbook
was under the direction of Arthur
D’Arazie~n, of the Photo-Reflex
Studios, Irving Stapsy, C41, and
Joe Cohen, C38.

of the Frick Acres buildings,”9

Coss stated, but he denied that
the cost of the lawn was large.

The lawn is seeded with a spe-
cial grass consisting of South Ger-
man Bent, Kentucky Blue Grass,
Pacey English Rye, and Red Top
in deﬁnite proportions. This mix-
ture was ﬁnally selected after
numerous plot experiments with
different mixtures.

The seed is sowed on top of soil
which has been graded and fer-
tilized to a depth of seven inches.
Some small portions of the lawn
have been sodded after the grass
was pre-grown in other plots.

The grass is cut at least one a
week, Coss said, depending upon
the amount of moisture and the
temperature which controls
growth. It is weeded periodical-
ly as needed.

The lawn is subject to natural
enemies in the forms of a coarse
fall grass and brown patch, which
is a fungi.

Cutting of the grass is done, for
the most part, by large gasoline
mowers. As these are awkward
to handle in close places, the
areas around trees, along walks,
and beside steps are ﬁrst cut with
small hand mowers.

The striped effect noticed on the
grass from the upper floors of the
Cathedral is somewhat similar to
the brushed nap effect of a
rug. This nap is caused by the
mowers going down the lawn one
way and returning in the other

direction.

Recent increased use of the
lawns by students was something
Mr. Coss refused to comment on.

Congratulations
To The President

The Pitt News pauses in its pace to offer
congratulations to John Downie, president of
the University Student-Faculty Association.
The Assembly deserves credit for a wise choice.

Downie has been on campus for tliree ‘_vea.rs,
he is a member of Delta Tau Delta, he led the
freshman dance. Downie is acquainted with
the ,University, its educational purposes and
activities.

He will inherit the position that is the most
highly respected, the most inﬂuential on cam-
pus. He will step into the shoes left‘ in the poli-
tical clothes closet by  Ernest Rose, Jr. He
will li:;ive many responsibilities.

Aiiiong 'Downie’s duties will be, as repre-
seiitative of the students, to niake student
opinion and student policy known and felt‘ on
the campus. He will have to act as an execu-
tivc——with understanding and breaailtli of in-
siglit——in lianding out coiiiinittee duties.

He will be responsible for introducing mem-
bers of the adininisigration to the :i:tud.ei1ts and
inembers of the student body to the adminis-
tr:-itioii.

Ainoiig policy considerations will be the
(lll.9Sl,l0Il of ASU and other liberal groups on
ckznnp-iis——tlie question of recognizing or reject-
ing .'i'll8lll.. That will attach itself to his office.

The question of an eiilarged Tuck Shop or
a Student ‘C&lzfe«tei'ia or a Student Union build-
ing will belong to him. He will be called upon
to express himself upon the status of atliletics,
the status of professors, the status of educa-
tion at the University.

He will find it necessary to form and formu-
late policy. He will discover the difference be-
tween sincerity and practicality, between pos-
sibilities and aspirations. He will ﬁnd many
who will try to force their opinions upon him,
and he must act or react accordingly.

John'Do'wnie, BA39, has the priinary position
of importance at the University. He is the
leader of the students.

Tomorrow night the assembly will elect
him.

Veterans Define
‘Americanism ’

Latest word from Hagueville, otherwise
known as Jersey City, N. J ., indicates that
those consistently staunch defenders of “Amer-
icanism,” the war veterans, are up in arms
against» two Congressmen who dare to denounce
the beloved Mayor Frank Ha‘g'ue as a “dicta-
tor,” and to protest the little reception party
staged last week by Jersey police for Socialist
leader Norman Thomas. A

 

The New’ Jersey Veterans’ Association, it is '

reported, put on an impromptu mass meeting
to “do or die for dear old Jersey (Hague),”
and to support the mayor “and other officials”
in their efforts “to prevent the Reds from in-
vading Jersey City. Said “Reds” being Con-
gressineii O’Connell and ‘Nilliaiii T. Bernard,
and said “impromptii” gathering being called
by Colonel Hugh Kelly, secretary to Jersey
Governor A. Harry Moore, a staunch admirer
,(st.ooge) of Mr. Hague.

If our memory has not been too clouded by
SIM. “.,plebisci'tes,” and peace “strikes,” and
-spring “festivals,” we seem to recall a “dem-
=:msti°iition" of local legionnaircs against the
Nazi activities by .1 -aertain Germaii-.Ainerican
“I-’»1inr.l” on the .\Torili Side not so long 
The veterans, and other aroused citizens, pro-

THE PITT NEWS

if T May Point

By Robert Saffron

Since yesterday was Mothers’ Day, it is only ap-
propriate that we set aside a few moments of
reverie to ‘think about mothers. A b

I am glad that we have a nation-wide Mothers’
Day. Not so much because it gives sorely needed
employment" to ﬂorists and-telegram boys,_ but be-
cause it honors a group which has been grievously
neglected.

Mothers are a large and important class, like the
veterans and the D. A. R. Someone has aptly re-
marked that half the married people in the world
are women. If follows, therefore, that half of the
married people in the world are potential mothers.

A Plant F or Mother

There are mothers everywhere, all over Europe
and Asia, and other continents. Even Russia has
mothers, although many deluded students believe
that Russia is only full of communists.

The true spirit of Mothers’. Day, however, has
been perverted by our crass and materialistic civil-
ization. Instead of being a day to which mothers
can look forward with an upleaning of their hearts,
Mothers’ Day now brings sorrow and friction into
thousands of American homes.

The trouble is that too many potted plants are
given on Mothers’ Day. This practice is not in-
herently malicious, but homes are torn asunder
over the problem of what to do with these plants.

Now, any mother will admit that ﬁnding room
around the house is a source of constant worry,
especially when she has to set up a refrigerator or
a radio or curtain-stretcher. You may say, with a
modicum of justification, that plants ‘take up much
less room than curtain-stretchers.

But if you wish to continue thinking in this same
groove all your life, nothing that I can say will
change your mind. You are living in a fool’s
paradise.

 

Stop This Foolishness

Most mothers, realizing that the size of our
macrocosmic civilization’s apartments does not per-
init the adequate placement of all the potted plant:-3
that they receive every year, are torn between two
courses:

(1) Shall they throw the plants into the garbage
can and possibly incur the wrath of a wronged son,
or daughter?

(2) Shall they set up the plants and await slow
death by strangulation as the plants grow?

This conflict is the determining factor in so many
cases of split personality among American mothers.
And if potted genaniums can split personalities,
they can split the Union.

Bloodshed will ensue, sons will rise in arms
against sons, fathers against father-—and mothers
against mothers. I say we’ve had enough of this
Mothers’ Day foolishness.

Let’s, abolish it for the sake of the future of
humanity.

There certainly should be no harm in telling you
that I Met My Love Again is an unobtrusive, inof-
fensive little picture that is as good as any for
killing two hours.

The film has/_ no particular meaning or social sig-
niﬁcance. It is just a simple triangle with perhaps
a few extra angles thrown in for good measure.
Joan Bennett and Henry Fonda are kids going to a
Vermont college. Henry is a serious, earnest sort of
fellow whose father had been a famous biologist.

Joan likes Henry and Henry likes Joan only his
affection is complicated by a desire to ‘take up with
the amoeba where his father left off. In spite of
the complication, however, the two became engaged.

It turns out to be one of those long engagements.
Finally one Christmas night Joan can no longer
stand it. She runs out and loses herself in a bliz-
zard. She runs into a cabin. She knocks, enters,
and ﬁnds there a pleasant looking wolf who writes
stories for True Confessions. The wolf is overcome
by J oan’_s simple charm and naivete. He finds her,
however, completely innocent of the ways of life.

The wolf’s line is very smooth and it is not 20
minutes before Joan throws caution to the winds
and elopes with him. The results  inevitable.
The wolf, though an amiable chap, is just a little
bit screwy. He comes to no good and is killed at
a wild party in Paris.

Joan returns to Vermont with her little daughter.
There she finds Henry a professor at the college.
Henry is leading a simple quiet life, undisturbed
except for the affections of a rich girl who thinks
she’s crazy about him and wants to marry him next
Tuesday. Well, there they are in that little ‘town;
Joan, the woman with a past; Henry, the professor
with the future; and the little rich girl with the
dough.

How does it end? Don’t be silly!

On the stage the incomparable music of Wayne
King. Mr. King in addition to leading the ﬁnest
of ﬁne bands is quite an accomplished In. c. He
introduces a stage show that is the best in many,
many moons. It is alone worth twice the price of
admission. Yes, I mean it.

Romance, mystery, and adventure all combined
this week in Four Men and a Prayer. The story
concerns the dastardly deeds committed» by muni-
tions companies which the presidents of the com-
panies do not sanction. General Tone: Instead of
saying, “The old man just croaked in the parlor,”
they exclaim, “The guv’nor has just perished in the
library, by his own hand. Oh for shame.” All in
all very English, very confusing, and at times a lit-
tle -gripping. Just a little. Stars Loretta Young

and a good looking Englishman named Greene. Go

Lucidus Says ‘No’

“Onward,- onward,” said-the Queen Ant, and paused for a

drink of water. _

.“0nward, my little people.

To you of the younger’ gen-

eration, we hand the torch. ‘Be yours to hold it high,” as the
poetknight have said. Now here you are, at the crossroads,
beside ‘the markers, on the Great Highway. Which Way will
you turn? ,Which way?” the Queen rhetoricized.

“I shall tell you the way. The way is to everlasting bright-

ness and to ever-shining
Good luck.” The Queen sat down '
heavily.

’iDaphine, Educator of the King-.
dom, thanked Her Majesty for her
“few words,” and announced that
the Distributor of Diplomas would
begin to distribute diplomas.

The ant hill became alive with
applause, The Distributor began
twisting his way between‘ the
aisles of graduating ants. As he
handed the diplomas to the ant,
the ant ﬂipped his mortar board
tassle.

DISTRIBUTOR APPLAUDS

The Distributor declared, shak-
ing antennae with the graduate:
“And now, my friend, you have
completed your education. Con-
gratulations and good luck.”

Interinittently the audience ap-
plauded, as one school favorite
after another ﬂipped tassle, ac-
cepted diploma, and smiled broad-
y. The Distributor returned the
mile.

P;.e;-;ently the Distributor stop-
ped smiling. He stood before the
ant known as Lucidus the ‘Wise,
who had gone through his four
years of class work in two and
one-half years. Lu-cidus was pre-
cocious and unpredictable.

The D.i.stribU.tor said with feel-
ing: “You have completed your
education. Congratulations.” He
handed Lucidus the diploma.

LUCIBUS DECLINES

Lucidus put on his glasses,
stared ﬁrst at the diploma, then
at the Distributor. He wiggled
the diploma an instant. Then he
handed it back to the Distributor.

The Distributor trembled with
amazement. “Don’t you want it?”

“No,” said Lucidus.

“Lucidus said no.” “Lucidus

the Queen, who was sitting back
in her chair, rubbing her eyes.

QUEEN AIVIAZED

The Queen bellowed:

takably she was angry.

As Lucidus approached, she
said:

“You don’t want your diploma?”

“No,” Lucidus responded.

“But why?” the Queen mur-
mured sotto-voice.

“Because ll haven’t completed
my education.”

“Haven’t completed ‘your edu-

ished. “Why you’re the very best

He became a l.i':tle more enthusi-

Waner the best hitter in the
league.

“If a fellow has great baseball
ability,” he advised, “he should
break into the game as soon as
poss.i‘§ole.” Even four good years
spent in college are four years
lost to the professional who could
be far on the road toward the
National League. “However, at
least ﬁfty per cent of their play-
ers have gone to college,” lvlungo
reported.

‘PAN’ COLLEGE COACHES

. The players had one big criti-
cism of college baseball—the
coaches should be men who have
played professional ball. Many
boys who are potential big
leaguers have been passed up in
college because the coach has not
had the experience to recognize
their possibilities.

They pointed out Duke univer-
sity as the outstanding exception.
Two veterans, Coombs and Irem
Thomas, old stars of. Connie Mack,
handle the coaching at Duke and
are developing many big league
players.

“Join the Yankees and see the
U. S.,” the Dodger’s new center
ﬁelder, Ernie Koy, conﬁded. As
soon as he was ﬁnished with col-

he never caught a glimpse of the

MONDAY, MAY 9, 1938

PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA

Out F1]1s

Greek to Greek . . . With the
athletic ascendancy of the
brothers in Phi Gamma Delta
during the past Spring Festival
caperings, there is eﬁected the
most equitable distribution of
‘trophy - winning potentialities
among the I-F Council brother-
hoods that the campus has seen in
recent semesters.

For the past few years, and up
to the present fall, whenever any-
one wanted a gander at any of the
' ‘ I-F cups, all he
had to do was
to take a walk
u p Dithridge
Street and look
on the Kappa
Sig s h e l V e s.
The Greek ath-
letic monopoly
b e l o n g e d to
t h e in. A n y
other house had
as much chance
of breaking into
it as an Inde-
pendent - Inde-
pendent has of getting into Men’s
Council.

Kappa Sigs Ahead

And, at the last official tabula-
tion, the Kappa Sigs were leading
the fraternal race for the all—point
trophy that lodges in brother
Corley’s 8th floor office. But, that
point total was made more than a
more than a month ago and there
is no question that the race has
been altered in the interim. Cor-
ley’s office promises an official re-
lease on these ﬁgures by Wed-
nesday.

Anyway, despite the absence of
the statistics, the fact that th-ere

 

Levison

are now a number of houses that

have undergone sufficient man-
power reinforcement to upset the
long and unmolested Kappa Sig
reign, is now a matter of current
record.

Always a power in the sweep-
stakes, the Phi Gams produced ad-
ditional strength in the track and
ﬁeld meet to wangle that trophy
out of the Kappa Sig clutch. An-
other significant turn of affairs

was accorded in the sweepstakesi

when Sigma Alpha Epsilon grab-
bed the ﬁrst prize.

SAE’s Perk Up

Only a year ago the SAE’s were
among the weak sisters in the
brothers’ rank. First indication
that they were coming up came
in the basketball tourney when the
Belleﬁelders started perking up.
Now they are a ranking power.

The biggest threat to the Kap-
pa Sig theory of rugged individ-
ualism has come from a Dithridge
Street neighbor. Bulwarked with
Daddio, Chickerneo, and Melvin,
the Theta Chis are now one of the
most ' formidable‘ “aggregations in
the league. »

Phi Kappa, Phi Delta Theta,
and Delta Tau Delta, perenially
among the best, are moving in
hard on the leaders and have con-
tributed immeasurably to the now
acknowledged ,fact.that it is any
brother’s race.

‘, perately.

Sigma Alpha Epsilon Beats

By JIM DAILEY

“The third time’s the
charm,” and the SAE’s proved
the ‘old saw by ﬁnally coming
through in the interfraternity
sweepstakes Friday afternoon,
barely nosing out the Phi Gams
by three-tenths of a second.

Year before last the SAE’s
lost when pilot Oscar Simmons
upset his car at famed “suicide
corner.” Last year they were

although their car was used by
the winning team.
LEZOUSKI SHOVES

This year, however, it was a dif-
ferent story. With the Phi Gams
dogging them the whole way and
almost causing an upset at the
ﬁrst pick—up station, the SAE

the first turn.

Going around the first turn in
‘front of the Phi Gams by a hair,
Al Lezouski, long-legged and pow-
Eerful footballer, lengthened the
I SAE lead going up Lytton avenue.

On the way down Parkman the
Phi Gains came up fast and by the
time the cars hit the Bigelow turn
were crowding close. Jockey Paul
Evans of SAE, however, held fast
to the outer end of the turn and
prevented the Phi Gains from
passing, although the “ﬁji’s” al-
most upset in the attempt.

PiKA’s THIRD

Johnson, SAE pusher who took
the ride down the hill, almost
ruined SAE chances by jumping
off the car too soon. He recover-
ed in plenty of time to get the car
to the ﬁnal pickup ahead of the
“ﬁjis” who were still trying des-
The Phi Gams still
could not pass in the stretch and
the SAE’s won in 3:2.

Second was Phi Gamma Delta
and third were the PiKas. Times
were 3:23 and 3:45, respectively. .

Pushers for the winners were
Lezouski, Cambal, McElfresh,
Adams, and McNeil with Paul
Evans in the driver’s seat.

gets into its second week of- com-
petition on two diamonds.

The hard-hitting - Scott club
opens the day’s activities at 3:30
o’clock when it meets Kappa
Alpha Phi on the football practice
ﬁeld. Ben ' Kish, Scott chucker,
seems to be one of the best pitch-
ers in the league, having hurled a
no—hit shutout in his ﬁrst start.
Kish also is a slugger, as are John-
ny Micheloson, Bill Daddio, and
George Delich.

JAFFEE’S PLAY

In the second game on the prac-
tice ﬁeld, the Phys Ed Juniors
battle Bert Jaffee’s Dithridge
Aristocrats. Included in the Phys
Ed lineup are Lupe Lupinacci and
Whitey Kosinski.

At 5 o’clock in the Stadium, the
Chem Frosh clash with the Phi
Kappa team. The Phi Kaps, play-
ino their opening game, will be
hampered by the loss of Ernie
“Dimples” Bonelli, who has trans-
ferred his slugging to the Fresh

State, 6-3

Pitt’s golfing “Big Four” came
through again last Friday after-
noon at Alcoma for a repeat win
over Penn State, 6-3, in an East-
ern Intercollegiate Conference
match.

The Panthers settled the match
after the first two foursomes had
completed their rounds, winning
the first four individual games
and the two best ball matches for
a 6-0 lead.

Penn State took the rest of the
match for all their point by win-
ning the last two individual and
best ball matches.

Frank Souchak was “hot” as he
defeated Joe Stevenson, Nittany
No. 1 man, 6 and 4, with a sub-
par 67. Tony Kaye, Pitt No. 2
man, kept his record of losing only
one match in the past two sea-
sons by winning a tough game
from State’s Bernie Burkett on
the last green, 1 up.

Barrett Melvin and Bill Daddio
at No. 1 and 2, respectively,
chalked up the other three wins.
Melvin beat Patterson, 6 and 4,
Daddio winning by the same score
over Gross. State won the best
ball match, 4 and 3. Miller and
Mahaffey of State won from Law-
rv and Simpson to garner the Li-

ons‘ three points.

SFA Assembly Meets

For Annual

Elections

Members To Votc“’

For Officials

Following Dinner :
(Continued From Page One)
tically assure that they will vote

in a solid block.

Six students will be elected to
the Executive Committee by the
Assembly members. The six, with
three faculty members, form the
committee which meets between
sessions of the Assembly and per-
forms the important organization
and executive work. The faculty
members are Miss Thyrsa W.
Amos, dean of women; Dr. Vin-
cent W. Lanfear, dean of men;
and Theodore W. Biddle, assist-
ant dean of men.

SIX FAVORED

Most likely to be elected to the
Executive Committee are six stu-
dents who are members of the
Coalition. They are: John Dow-
nie, BA39; Al Kairys, BA39; Bern-
ard Mayer, C39; Mercedes Shiring,
C40; Ann Whippo, C39; and Frank
Widney, D39. Downie as the choice
of the Coalition, is expected by
political observers to be elected
President of SFA.

Downie, Delta Tau Delta, and
Mayer, Phi Epsilon Pi, are lead-
ers of the fraternity division of
the Coalition in the Assembly.
Miss Shiring, Theta Phi Alpha,
who received the highest vote to-
tal ever cast for an SFA candidate,
is the third probable Executive
Committee member from the fra-
ternity group.

Kairys, a non-fraternity man,
Widney, of the School of Dentist-
ry, and Miss Whippo, Zeta Tau
Alpha, are Coalition members
who belong to groups which for-
merly comprised the Dent-Inde-
pendent party. If all six of the
Coalition leaders are elected to
the Executive Committee, they
may be expected, at least tempor-
arily, to work together as a group
and maintain the Coalition front
intact.

NAME OFFICERS l

Following the new election pro-
cedure which was established by
amendment of the SFA constitut-
tion last December, the president,
vice-president, and secretary of
SFA will be nominated from the
floor and elected by vote of the
entire Assembly. In former years,
the election of officers was done
by the members of the Executive
Committee.

Under the system used to elect
the SFA president in former years, '
the faculty members frequently
held the balance of power between
the student factions on the Execu-
tive Committee. This meant that
the administration could swing the
election of a president in the di-
rection they desired.

At tomorrow’s meeting, the
members of the Executive Com-
mittee will be elected ﬁrst. The
nomination and election of officers
will follow immediately after the
Executive Committee has been se-
lected. An officer of _SFA must be
a member of the Executive Com-
mittee.

Members of the present and
next year’s Executive Committees
will meet next week to make com-
mittee appointments for the 1938-
39 school year.

Choice Today

Students in the college whose
last names begin with the initials
M through Z are to visit the of-
ﬁces of their major department
this week, to pre-register, accord-
ing to Dr. Stanton C. Crawford,
dean of the college.

“Tentative schedules should be
prepared after consulting your
faculty adviser.” adds Dr. Craw-
ford. “This schedule along with
your latest blueprint, should be
brought to the pre-registration.

Regardless of the student’s un-
certainty, Dr. Crawford advises
prompt attention to making the
tentative schedule and presenting
it. It is a University rule that no
student can register next fall

who has not ﬁlled out a course se-
lection card.

Special groups who will not be
required to register their choice
of courses are: freshmen in the
college who entered in February,

Carnegie Museum Exhibits New
Group Of American Sculptures

By RICHARD COOPER

Opening last Thursday, an ex-
hibition of American sculpture
has been assembled on the bal-
cony of the hall of sculpture in the
Carnegie Museum, and will be
there until June 19. Consisting of
about one hundred pieces, the
group is modern in point of time,
though not entirely so in spirit.

Subject in the exhibit range
from the strong, photographic
“Lincoln” of the late George Grey
Barnard to John H. Storr’s mod-
ernistic abstraction, “Study in
Architectural Forms.” Some of
the better known sculptors ex-
hibited are: Jose de Creeft, Paul
Manship, William Zorach, Sidney
Waugh, Alexander Archipenko, J 0
Davidson, A. Stirling Calder, and
Maurice Sterne. «

Taken as a group, the exhibi
tion shows what a conglomeration
of schools and trends modern, os-

A
V’

tensibly “American” sculpture
has become. Classical ideas per-
sist in the works of such men as
Manship and Waugh. These men
are “line—sculptors,” ﬁnding reali-
ty in details, in contrast to the
more modern “mass—sculptors.”
But if the _older schools endure,
the newer ones are none-the-less
prominent in the Carnegie show.
A popular subject, “l\/Iaternity,”
is wrought in current massiveness
by Jose de Creeft, showing only
the head and shoulder of a mother
with her child. Another but less
serious modern study is the “W0-
man with Violin” of Henry Kreis.
.More extreme abstractions are
Alexander Archipenko’s “Walk-
ing—1937,” and John B. Flanna-
gan’s “Group for Skyscraper
Court.”
, Sculpture, if not so popular as
painting, is just as variable.

District Business Hits New Low

After Five VVeeks Of Decline

Business in the Pittsburgh dis-¢

trict fell to a new low for the
year last week after dropping
again to make the ﬁfth consecu-

tive week of decline, according to
the weekly summary of the bureau
of business research.

Except for a large gain in new
automobile registrations nearly all
lines of economic activity de-
clined or showed less than sea-
sonal increases.

Steel mill and blast furnace op-

erations in the district were fur-
ther curtailed last week from their
already low and irregular mark.
River traffic remained about the
same but carloadings decreased.

A resume of department store
sales released by the Bureau
showed a 13 per cent dropifor the
last four weeks over the same pe-
riod last year and combined sales
in the ﬁrst four months about12
per cent below the total in the ﬁrst
four months of 1937.

War Defense

is Necessity,

Says Holcomhe .

Military Preparation

Needed To Shorten
Duration Of. Conﬂict:

Vifith anarchy the‘ rule in inter-
national relations today, the Unit-
ed States needs “adequate, and
thorough” military preparation, to
shorten the duration of any war
n which it might become in-
volved.

That is the opinion which Col-
onel John Lee Holcombe, profes-
sor and head of the department of
military science and tactics, ex-
pressed in his address at Pitt
Riﬂes forum last Thursday.

“Proper preparation for war,”
declared Colonel Holcombe, “will
insure that any conflict in which
we might become involved will be
short, sharp, and decisive. And it
will insure against another thing-—
the one thing that’s worse than
winning a war—that’s losing a
war.”

Pointing out that much of the
world’s history has simply been a
record of wars, Colonel Holcombe
maintained that war is similar
in its recurrence to the evils of
pestilence, famine, crime, and
death.

“I don’t say that war will never
be eliminated,” he said, “but I be-
lieve that we may always have it
with us. I don’t want to defend
war, but I do want to state that
its nature is basic, that it is prob-
ably a necessary ingredient in hu-
man progress. Many of the great-
est advances of science have been
made in time of war.”

By adequate military and naval
preparation, the length of wars
may be shortened, he claimed.
Within the past century, there has
been no war longer than four
years, he said, but four years of
war is “altogether too much.”

“Between any true paciﬁst and
any true soldier,” said Colonel
Holcome, “there is no diﬁerence
in their ﬁnal aims. They both
agree that War is objectionable.
The question is, ‘how best to ob-
tain peace?’ ” I

Activities Rank
F or Graduation
At Dickinson

CARLISLE, Pa.—(ACP)—-Dicl*-
inson college has made participa-
tion in extra-curricular activities
a requirement for graduation.

In a report by a special com-
mittee which established the new
rule for students in this liberal
arts college, the faculty assumed
complete regulation of all student
activities.

President Fred Pierce Corson,
said: “The report is the result of
a long and careful study in which
a large number of students par-
ticipated. It is based on the be-
lief that extra-curricular activi-
ties should be a part of the stu-
dent’s development and should
not take any time which belongs
to other phases of students’ devel-
opment.”

The committee, it was said, has
attempted to do two things: ﬁrst,
to restrict the over-assertive stu-
dent; and secondly, to compel the
inactive student to participate in
outside activities.

The maximum number of activi-
ties in which a student is allowed
to participate is figured in terms

of hours, and the minimum par-
ticipation allowed a student is ﬁg-
ured in terms of value points.
The committee recommends
that the student with an A aver-
age for the last semester of the
preceding year should be allowed
unlimited privileges, that the B
student be restricted to 1,000
hours, the C student to 750 hours,
and the D student to 500 hours.
Also, it is required that the mem-

bers of the upper three classes’

earn at least 100 value points dur-
ing the year.
