statement

‘ offends
  ACLU

 

-bership

By Lou Grieco
Staff Writer

By attacking Michael Dukakis’

A affiliation with the American Civil

Liberties Union, Vice President
Bush has become an unwilling
spokesman forthe organization,
according to Barbara Wolvovitz,
executive director of Pittsburgh's
ACLU chapter. 1

’’I think he's done a great job
as a membershipdrive,” Wol-
vovitz said yesterday. ’_’The num-
bers of people who have called
since the debate asking for mem-
apphcaﬁons
skyrocketted."

Wolvovitz said that‘ the ACLU
is a non—partisan organization that
represents people from all across
the political spectrum, despite at-
tacks from some conservatives
that it is a liberal organization.

Wolvovitz saidthe purpose of
the ACLU is ”to serve as a watch-

dog to insure that the bill of rights »

is not infringed upon.”

Concerning Bush’s opinion on
the ACLU, Wolvovitz said, ’’I
think it's unfortunate, because it
shows not only a disrespect for
the ACLU, but for the Constitu-
tion and the Bill of Rights:

’’I think that for some people,
the positions we take are per-
ceived asliberal.”

Itis the policy of the ACLU not
to give out the names of its mem-
bers, though Wolvovitz said that
people of both parties are in-
volved with the organization.

The ACLU petitioned on behalf
of Lt. Col. Oliver North because
they felt that his rights were vio-
lated by the use of his televised

‘ testimony against him. Wolvovitz

said that this does not mean that
they support North, but that they
feel that he deserves a fair trial.

Wolvovitz called Bush's
charges against the ACLU ”a dis-
tortion of ACLU policy.”

For example, the ACLU feels
that the ratings system for movies
should be a guideline only, and
that by not letting certain people
in, the movie theaters are practic-
ing censorship. She said that par-
ents should set up a value system
for their own children.

Commenting the vice presi-
dent's allegation that the ACLU
supports child pornography,
Wolvovitz said ”the policy sup-
ports the rights of children not to
be used or abused.”

She said that one has to look at

University Honors College stu-
dents will benefit from--visiting
faculty and conferences as a
result of the recent endowment of

the Lerner Chair.

These UHC functions were a
result of the allotment of funds
made by this year's recipient,
Dean Alec Stewart.

’’I think what is exciting about
this support is that it enables us
to make professional, scholarly
and undergraduate educational
initiatives proceed together,” said

Thirteen years ago, an ar-
chitect, visiting institutions in
North Carolina for severely han-
dicapped children, found barren
walls, little furniture and no toys
in the facilities. As a result, Tho-
mas Sayre, national secretary for
the Pi Kappa Phi fraternity, ”do-
nated pieces of his architecture to
such institutions so that the chil-
dren could play on them," said
William Leezer, an Associate
Chairman for the organization

“Sayre 5 subsequently’ oriigi nated-

Stewart. .

Kim Watterson, director of ad-
vising at the UHC, said, ”As an
advisor, I like to inform the stu-
dent of what lies beyond the for-
mal course work. Part of the
Lerner Chair endowment allows
us to bring in guestspeakers and
have the students at the UHC par-
ticipate in special conferences.”

The Lerner Chair endowment
at the UHC supports such func-
tions as undergraduate indepen-
dent study and summer research
projects, and it also enables stu-
dents to present papers on a
professional level.

  UHC to benefit from endowment

Last year, the UHC hosted
guest professor Asgar Aaboe of
Yale University. Aaboe was able -
to come to Pitt because of the
Lerner Chair.

, Morton Lerner is the chief oper-
ating officer of Lerner Shoes In-
corporated, which operates over i
60 independent stores in the
South East. Lerner earned a B.A.
in business in 1949, and an
M.B.A. in retailing in 1950 from
the University of Pittsburgh.

Trustees

  approve

dorm  
funding J

By Stephanie Myers
Staff Writer

The University of Pittsburgh’s
Board of Trustees has voted to
borrow funds at the amount of
$54,000,000. This money will go
to the No. 1 priority construction
of a 1,000 bed dormitory.

The university has no room for
this dormitory at the present time,
but the money has been ap-
proved. " ' . .

Student Government Board
President Craig Jackson com-
mented that the proposition for a
new dormitory’ was long over-

, due. Jackson stated, ’’I am very

glad that the administration is do-
ing something about this
problem. Lack of on-campus

. housing is costing many out-of-

state as well as in—state’students
who have contributed to this
university.”

The College of Arts and
Sciences has discussed how to
improve academic life at Pitt.

They focused on the lack of study
space available to students. CAS
advisors have petitions going

around demanding more stud
space. ~ . . »

They recommend that the Tow-

er's Cafeteria be open late at
night for additional use by the
students. ’

The CAS also discussed how
cheating can be eliminated; not
Just cheating‘ on exams but also
plagiarizing in papers. The goal
is to protect those students who
are here to get an education and
stop those who are taking advan-
tage of the system just to get

through.

Tomorrow, on the Cathedral

tional pushing of the wheelchair.

1 ’’It takes just a little bit of my

time, but if I can be of any sup-

ganization provides a very
important public service while
raising lots offunds.”

”Last year we doubled the
amount we'd collected national-
ly the year before by bringing in
$230,000. Our local goal is to

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, October I3, I988

Busted drug operation had netted $144 million.

PHILADELPHIA (AP) -— Thir-
teen central Pennsylvania resi-
dents have been charged with

running a 24-hour drug operation I

that netted at least $144 million
in 16 months, the FBI said Wed-
nesday.

”We’re emphasizing that this
gang operated basically a market-
place for drugs with 24-hour serv-
ice for new and old customers,”
agent John Kundts said.

Agents arrested eight suspects
Tuesday and seized a luxury car,
a van and $60,000 in cash,
Kundts said. Under the federal
forfeiture law, which allows the
government to take anything pur-
chased with drug profits, prose-
cutors also will try to seize two
houses, Kundts said.

Two brothers remained fugi-
tives. Two other suspects already
were jailed, and one remained
hospitalized from a recent car ac-
cident, Kundts said.

The ring sold marijuana, co-
caine and methamphetamine
from several locations . in the
Columbia area of Lancaster
County, according to Wayne G.
Davis, agent in charge of the

Philadelphia bureau.
Gerald Lynn Smith, 27, of
Columbia started the operation

June 1, 1987, and sold up to 80 .

kilos of cocaine a week for about
$25,000 each, Kundts said.

Drug distributor
gets five-year term

PITTSBURGH (AP) ~— A man
from New York's Queens section
was sentenced Wednesday to
five years in prison for his convic-
tion for possesion with intent to
distribute more than a half kilo-
gram of cocaine, the U.S. Attor-
ney’s office said.

Frank P. DelGeorge, 29, of the
Howard Beach neighborhood
must also undergo five years of
supervised release, under terms
of the sentence imposed by U.S.
District Judge Barron P. McCune.

DelGeorge entered a guilty
plea under a bargain in which
prosecutors dropped a charge of
possession with intent to deliver
marijuana.

Applying a drug courier profile,

agents of the Drug Enforcement
Administration confronted Del-
George at the Amtrak station in
Pittsburgh and found the cocaine,
which was 92 percent pure, and
marijuana in his luggage.

Pennsylvania gets
unexpected snowfall

HARRISBURG (AP) ~ The first
snow of the season swept into
Pennsylvania on Wednesday,
downing weaker tree limbs and
utility lines and causing several
minor traffic accidents in the
northwestern corner of the state.

The snow was caused by the
”lake effect” of cold air sweep-
ing across the relatively warm
water of Lake Erie and by a chill
in higher elevations of the north-
ern Pennsylvania mountains, ac-
cording to the National Weather
Service at Pittsburgh.

”We have trees down across

the road and, because of that,
there are some roads where the
cars can't go through,” said An-
nette Bar at the state police bar-
racks at Corry. ”The cars were
trying to go around the branches,
and they ended up in ditches. So
we've had a lot of accidents.

Porn phone services
now available free

PHILADELPHIA (AP) -— Dial—a-
porn firms have decided to pro-
vide very cheap thrills over Bell
of Pennsylvania phone lines,
providing free access to sexually
explicit taped messages that
usually cost about $2 a call.

Although the phone company
went to great lengths to prevent
dail-a-porn entrepreneurs from
making their messages available
to children for a fee, the compa-
ny apparently can do nothing to
prevent children from listening
for free,

The numbers have not been

StudentHealth Service
creates nutrition group

By Michelle Kleinsak

For The Pitt News

One of the greatest concerns of

college students today is weight
gain. .
"Most of the students here eat
poorly. For a lot of students, it's
their first time away from home,
and they just go crazy, and then
they come to me with weight
gain,” said Patti Verdi, a gradu-
ate student who works with the
Student Health Service on
campus.

Verdi's goal is to improve stu-
dents’ eating habits through a ser-
ies of lectures, held every
Wednesday at 3 p.m., on such
topics as nutrition, food advertise-
ment, exercise and eating dis-
orders.

The lectures also serve to dis-
pel myths surrounding certain
foods.

During yesterday's lecture,
several students said they have
chosen to abstain from red meat
because of the alleged health
dangers it poses, and because
they've become used to not hav-
ing it in their diet.

Verdi said that meat provides a
large source of protein that is
needed in a healthy diet. She also
said that females in general are
prone to iron deficiencies.

”Seven out of 10 of the lead-
ing killer diseases in this country,
such as heart disease, cancer, al-
coholism and diabetes, are
nutrition-related,” Verdi said.

Ninety percent of the people
who come to see her are females
who want to lose weight, al-
though a few of the cases are
medical-related. Many of the in-
ternational students also come to
Verdi with their nutritional
problems.

”I like working with students.
They're a lot more receptive to in-
formation than older people. By
the time you reach older people,
they're kind of set in their ways,”
Verdi said. »

’’I _think you are really going to
have to have an attitude change
to be successful at weight reduc-
tion. If there is an attitude change,
then there is almost always a be-
havior change. I've come to that
conclusion from working with
the students,” said Verdi.

Students get chance to play market

By Kevin Gillespie

_ For The Pitt News

How would you like to play
a game of risks without having
to worry about any disastrous
consequences? How about be-
coming an investor in the
stock market with nothing to
lose and $25,000 to gain?

No this is not a pitch to sell
a piece of land in Florida. This
contest is quite legitimate.

The game is called the
AT&T Collegiate Investment
Challenge, and its re-creation
of actual stock market trading
without financial risk to its
players has already, in its first
year, drawn national attention.

There are more than 10,000
college students already
registered for the contest, and
the number may double by the
registration deadline, October
21.

”This competition gives
AT&T a chance to reach the
college campus,” said Bryant
Steele of AT&T, ”and in a very
differant way.”

The contest begins when the
stock market opens for trading
on November 1, and con-
tinues until the market’s clos-
ing day on February 28.

Players start with a
$500,000 brokerage account,
with the goal to successfully
invest in any of the 5,000

stocks listed in Standard & ’

Poor’s Stock Guide.

The trading simulates the ac-
tual process of stock dealing,
because Wall Street Games
uses a computerized stock
quotation network which
receives up—to—the-minute
prices via satellite. You can
not get much closer to the real
life ups and downs of the mar-

ket than the AT&T Challenge
does.

While making transactions,
the players will be using a toll
free AT&T 800 Calling Serv-
ice. Each month these transac-
tions result in a current status
report, which each individual
player receives in the mail.

The top 100 at the end of
each of the four months will
receive a Benetton wrist watch
and a pair of Reebok athletic
shoes.

At the closing of the market
the ten students who compiled
the most valuable stock port-
folios receive cash prizes total-
ing $61,500 with a grand
prize of $25,000. Overall
there will be $200,000 in cash
and prizes awarded.

”Underlying the competi-
tion and the prizes is the

New Pitt monument
dedicated at service

By Michelle L. O'Brien

Staff Writer

The ll-ton, yellow sculpture
”Light—Up” became a permanent
part of the landscape outside
Forbes Quadrangle in a dedica-
tion ceremony yesterday.

The sculpture was donated to
the university by the Westing-
house Electric Corporation.

Westinghouse Chief Executive
Officer John Marous, who is also
chairman of Pitt's board of
trustees, said the sculpture would
”serve as a symbol of the cooper-
ation that is necessary between

industry and academia.”

University President Wesley
W. Posvar said the gift ”is
representative of the generosity
Westinghouse.” '

”Light—Up” is the creation of
the late minimalist artist Tony
Smith. Westinghouse commis-
sioned Smith to design the work
for the entrance to its headquar-
ters in 1974.

Marous said the gift indicates
that ”Westinghouse has no small
feeling for Pitt.” V

He also said that over 2,700
Pitt graduates are currently em-
ployed by Westinghouse.

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, October l3, T988

By Brian Palmey

Associated Press Writer

WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP)
—-— Police know many facts about
the hit-and—run death of Mark
Baltes, whose body was dragged
60 feet when it was struck by a
white Buick after midnight on
March 9, 1986.

But an attorney who knows
what prosecutors don't —— the
name of the driver —- has shield-
ed the identity for more than two
years. This week, Barry Krischer
may finally be ordered to divulge
his secret.

In a decision that challenges
the tenets of the attorney-client

privilege of confidentiality, a
Palm Beach Circuit Court judge
is considering a request by Baltes’
parents to force Krischer to dis-
close his client's name.

However Judge Timothy Poul-
ton rules, both sides have
pledged to continue in a higher
court their battle over whether
civil responsibility supersedes the
attorney—client privilege.

”l believe this case will go to
the Supreme Court,” said lawyer
F. Lee Bailey, who has been fol-
lowing the case. ”The law in this
area is so unclear, it ought to go.
The Supreme Court was made for
cases like this.”

The unusual struggle, which

has aroused considerable interest
in the legal community, began
the day after the accident when
the driver asked Krischer if he
would initiate a plea-bargain ar-
rangement without revealing the
client’s name to authorities.
According to police, Baltes, a
28-year-old electrician, was in-
toxicated and quarreled with his
fiancee as she drove home from
a night out. Baltes got out of the
car and staggered down the road.

A short while later, he was
struck and was pronounced dead
at the scene. Baltes’ blood-
alcohol level was 0.26, more
than two times the legal intoxica-
tion level.

Detectives used car fragments
at the scene and paint chips from
Baltes’ skull to theorize the vehi-
cle was a 1984 or 1985 white
Buick Riviera. But hundreds of
police interviews and a reward
failed to vield any firm suspects.

pressure to disclose the name, re-

with prosecutors but did not

divulge Krischer’s link to the

case. He never learned the name
of the driver.

Krischer eventually came for-

client.

Posing for Playboy not good for a career

Playboy is old news.

In March of I989, this maga-
zine will hit the newsstands
featuring photographs of nude
women from Big East Conference
schools. Ooh, boy.

I have no idea how many
women at the University of Pitts-
burgh will be interviewed to ap-
pear in the April issue. Some will
be prodded by friends; others
won't. But they will all ”audi-
tion” of their own volition.

The Hugh Hefner empire is
waning. The heyday of the Play-
boy club is over. Trends are con-
servative, and yet, magazines
which feature nude women still
pervade our newsstands and
bathrooms. '

Two years ago, I would have
condemned any female who
wanted to appear nude in a
magazine. But now, I am ambiva-
lent. If that's for you, fine.

Relatively recently, Playgirl
magazine adopted a policy of no

Remembering those long lost friends

A few days ago, I received a let-
ter from an old high school
friend. We haven't seen or heard
from each other since the night
we got drunk and promised to
”keep in touch," three years ago.

Her name is Stacy, and we
were once close friends. I'm not
.sure what we are now.

We met as freshmen on the first
day of school. A year later, I
thought I was in love with her. It
seemed too stupid to tell her. I
guess I was afraid.

The average teenage romance
never seemed to last over two
months. Stacy and I were friends
for years.

Her letter was only a couple
pages long and mostly contained
standard information one might
discuss in an elevator. She said
her classes were boring, she
broke up with her boyfriend and
she was moving back to Philadel-

frontal nudity. I find ‘photos of
that nature to be far more erotic.

While the fiction and writing is
far superior in Playboy than its
Bob Ceuccione-counterpart, Pent-

SANSIG

house (which I consider to be the
second, semi-acceptable maga-
zine of its genre), Playboy is a
cultural dinosaur by my
standards.

As aspiring professionals (and
let's’ assume for the sake of argu-
ment those women who are at-
tending college are), women
must consider the implications
and future consequences of ap-
pearing in risque photographs.

I'd imagine a career in broad-
cast and even print journalism for
myself would be marred with
difficulty if I ever appeared in the
buff in a magazine.

should come home, too.

Technically, she was the same.
Her handwriting was still crooked
and she remembered our old, in-
side jokes. I read it three times,
but the experience still lacked
something. I dug out- my old year-
book and looked at ‘her picture as
a visual aid. It just seemed posed.

It bothered me that the letter
didn't hold more significance. It
wasn't the quantity or quality, it
was just me.

When I said good-bye to my
old friends at Harriton High
School, I suspected that many
friendships would die. However,
I believed in exceptions. Many of
us did.

It's easy to say that someone is

your friend. It is a general term.

When the word ”friend” doesn't

seem to serve a full description,
‘one can simply add the word

”best.” Regardless of what we

My ambitions (and hopefully
yours) run more along the lines
‘of making the covers of Time,
Fortune 500, Forbes and maybe
Life.

Why waste your time appear-
ing nude in some has-been maga-
zine when you could be taking
over the corporate world?

Is money the factor? Sure, it's
nice to make $15,000 to be
centerfold. ‘

And just think of how it will en-
hance your resume. You're just
out of law school, Ms. Smith, and
it goes something like this:

Dear Sirs and Mesdames,
I feel I am uniquely
qualified to work for
your firm. I have three
years experience as a
paralegal for the firm
Bartles, James and
Iones, and served as
editor of my school

more complicated.

I once assumed that if two peo-
ple wanted to be true friends,
there wouldn't be too many ob-
stacles. I was wrong.

”Out of state, out of mind,” is
a common interpretation of
broken interpersonal relation-

ships. Is it that easy? Unfortunate-
Iy, yes.

Most of us would like to think
that our friends are unique. We
survive and seek comfort from
them. From the moment we learn
to speak, we search for friends to
play with. The only problem
which arises from this positive
behavior is what we do when
we're through with a friend.

In reality, friends exist for our

My QPA is 4.0, and
I graduated first in my
class.

Also, I appeared in
the ”Cirls of the Big

‘ East Conference”
spread in the April,
1989, issue of Playboy
as an undergraduate. I
was wearing a ponytail
and Pitt boxer shorts.

how to coexist, give and take.
When we're no longer benefit-
ing, we selfishly, though natural-
ly, look for someone else.

To benefit the most from a
friendship, one usually wants
more interaction than a tele-
phone call and a birthday card.
One can easily forget the content
of a friendship like the questions
of an old history exam.

We lose friends more often
than we think. It's impossible to
maintain constant contact with
anyone. Soon, we just give up
and put more energy into the
relationships in our immediate
area.

Lack of convenience is an un-
derstandable reason to abandon
a friend. However, it is not
legitimate.

Strong friendships never really
die; rather, they enter hiberna-
tion. I admire Stacy for trying to

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, October l3, T988

By Dmitri Ragano
For The Pitt News

Nearly 25 years ago, John Len-
non bragged that the Beatles
were ”more popular than Jesus.”
Since then, he has almost always
been surrounded by controversy.
It's been eight years since his trag-
ic death. But this fall, he has been
subject to more scrutiny than any
living rock star. ,

The current media blitz began
with Albert Goldman's The Lives
of/ohn Lennon, a sordid exami-
nation of the late Beatle which
raised charges ranging from
anorexia to, murder. Yoko Ono
conceived Imagine john Lennon
to counter the biography.
Documentary maker David Wol-
per has incorporated Ono's col-
lection of home movies into the
film.

But much of Imagine, particu-

I larly the Beatles footage, is recy-
cled material and will be familiar
to fans. The film probably would
not have been made if it weren’t
for the scandal surrounding the
Goldman book.

Imagine doesn't contribute any

Beatles. It is a moving tribute, but
it does little more than reassert
what most of us already believed:
Lennon was one of the great art-
ists and personalities of our time.

Interviews with Lennon, the
aunt who raised him, and his first
wife give a portrait of an excep-
tionally talented adolescent
haunted by a painful relationship
with his mother.

This leads to the forming of the

young Beatles and their rise to

stardom: meeting manager Brian
Epstein in the Cavern, instant
fame in America, the hilarious
press conferences, etc. All of this
is essentially the same as in The
-Compleat Beatles.

Watching the concert close—ups
of the puffy, sweating Beatles
again reminded me that rock stars
didn't always have the glossy,
pre-packaged look of the MTV
era.

After theSgt. Pepper phase, the
film focuses on John and Yoko
and their life together. Michael
Jackson, Prince and company
may take a lot of ribbing, but it
can’t_ compare with what these
two went through.

Lennon and Ono’s encounter
with a belligerent Al Capp (the
creator of Li’l Abner) seems to
epitomize the clash of genera-
tions in the ’60s that we hear so
much about.

In another scene, Lennon
delivers a vicious attack on Paul
McCartney. Lennon was never
more audacious than immediate-
ly following the Beatles split.

Things got quieter with the
”lost weekend” period and his
life as a ”house husband” in the
mid to late ’70s. The film gives
more interviews from Ono and
son Sean before a touching re-
count of the end.

Some have accused Imagine of
being a ”whitewash job,” but the
Lennon it presents is no saint.

Iggy Pop rediscovers primal urge on newLP

ﬁggy Pop
Instinct
A&M

The title for the latest release
from Iggy Pop, Instinct, captures
the essence of the album in one
full sweep. It elicits your instinc-
tive needs, your inbred drive for

‘survival, shelter and sex. Its ”lust
for life” is most prominent, and
these tunes whip you into a feel-
ing of invincibility. Even a direct
hit from a nuclear warhead
would leave you laughing, slight-
ly singed, but ready for the next
wave.

It's encouraging to see Iggy
return to the basics. His previous
endeavor, Blah—BIah—Blah, while
musically diverse, was more of an
experimentation in variety. It was
enjoyable, but it left you con-

Iavinced that Iggy had finally
mellowed.

Instinct revitalizes the vigor of
the Stooges. The feeling of fore-
boding death and the imminent
need for insane amusement has
returned. Electrically heavy
chords and omnipotent bellow-
ing dominate this album. Iggy is
no longer crying for love, but
growling for the scrutiny he

‘received as the front man for the
‘Stooges.

UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH THE PITT NEWS

Pitt tries to rebound against 1-3 Temple

_ _ _ . Jon Wells/The Pitt News
Following three consecutive losses, the Panthers Will try to pick themselves up against Temple.

By Vince Carey

Sports Editor

The Temple Owls (1-3) are hav-
ing a tough seasonso far. They
have lost to Syracuse (31-21),
Alabama (37-0) and Penn State
(45-9). Their only win was a 12-7
squeaker over Navy. A lot of
points given up, not a lot scored.

The Pitt Panthers (2-3) aren’t
doing much better. After defeat-
ing Northern lowae (59-10) and
Ohio-State (42-10), they have lost
three straight games: 31-10 to
West Virginia, 34-31 to Boston
College and 30-20 to Notre
Dame.

”There were a lot of positive
things that came out of the Notre
Dame game,” Pitt coach Mike
Gottfried said. “Our kicking
game came through for us in
some clutch situations. Our
offense gave a very good perfor-
mance. Even though we gave up
30 points, we did do a good job.”

The big difference between the
two teams is that the Panthers
have gone down fighting, while
the Owls are just plain losing.

”Offensively, we don’t have
too many people doing a good
job,” Temple coach Bruce Arians
said. ”We have not done too
much on offense.”

The Temple offense has only

  

gained 974 yards of total offense
so far this season (457 yards on
the ground and 517 yards
through the air).

It is the Owl defense that is
keeping them in games. They
have held opponents to only
1,317 total yards, compared to
Pitt, which has given up 1,498
yards.

”Our defense has played as
well as we had expected,” Ariens
said. ”lt’s just that they wear
down easily, and our offense
hasn’t been able to do much.”

Temple has changed its offense
from last season. The team used
to play in the I-formation; now it
plays something called the multi-
bone. Gottfried said it was a
”wishbone type offense, where
you do more out of it than just
run the wishbone. You move
people around a lot. So you have

the wishbone-type look, but you

can do other things with it.”

Pitt defensive end Burt Gross-
man doesn't know what the
multi—bone is and doesn't really
know how to defend it.

”We have seen it on film, but
it doesn't look too successful,”
Grossman said. ’’I don't know

why they changed, because they
had great success running the ball
last year.” «

Houston.

Houston will be highly moti-
vated to play the Lady Panthers,
but at least one key Pitt perform-
er has a score to settle.

Senior middle-blocker Nora
Mulvihill commented, ”This is
one of the most important tour-
naments of the year for us, it
could be a determining factor in
going to the NCAA. I want to beat
Houston so badly because last
year I was injured and didn't play
against them.”

The Lady Panthers have played
in two tournaments this year and
have won them both with five
different players making an all-
tournament team.

Early in the season at the Ball
State Classic, Denise Frawley was
named tournament MVP and was
joined on the all—tourney team by
Kelly Matheis and freshman stan-

‘ dout Dee MacAu|ay.

Three weeks ago, Frawley was
selected MVP of the West Vir-
ginia Classic, with Jenelle Lan-
tagne and Mulvihill being named
to the all-tournament team as
well.

”We have a lot of players mak-
ing strong contributions. It's go-
ing to take some great play from
our top players, and the other
players must continue making

‘strong contributions for us to

win,” said Collier.

A barometer of the Lady Pan-
thers’ performance will be the
play of All—American candidate
Frawley. .

”Denise has to play real well
for us any time we take on this
caliber of competition,” Collier
noted.

_ /\/IuIti—bone offense may

prove costly to /\/Ic/\/air,
Temple's running game

By Vince Carey
Sports Editor

The Temple Owls have had a
couple of good running backs in
recent years. In 1985, Paul
Palmer helped put the Owls on
the map by running for 1,516
yards and finishing in the top five
in Heisman Trophy voting.

Last season, Todd McNair burst
onto the scene and ran for 1,058
yards, including 213 against Pitt.
This season has been a little
tougher for McNair. Through four
games, he has carried the ball
only 42 times for 139 yards.

The biggest reason for this has
been that the Owls changed to
the multi-bone offense, which is
more like the wishbone and is
more conducive to passing.

”Teams are not letting me get
the football to Todd,” Temple
coach Bruce Arians said. ”Plus,
being in the bone limits him to
the right and option plays. We
are making our quarterback run
the ball. We want to be able to
get him to run the football in both
directions. We have been work-
ing on some plays to get him the
b_all, but we haven't been able to
put them into the game yet.”

The new offense hasn't worked
so well early in the season, hav-
ing helped the team score only
33 points on the way to a 1-3
record. Temple is struggling right
now, but McNair is optimistic.

”This season has been a little
tough for us so far,” McNair said.
”The team isn't down right now,
because we know we have
played some tough teams."

McNair is from Pennsauken,
N.J., and was an honorable men-
tion on Bally’s All—American team
as a senior. He has always been
on a winning team and finds
Temple a little tough to handle
sometimes.

’’I never regret my decision to
join the Temple program,”
McNair said. ’’It is a little tough
at times, though. We don't get a
lot of support, except for the peo-
ple in the Temple football fami-
ly. We don't draw big crowds,
and that sometimes brings the
team down. ,

”Like the Penn State game [a
rare sellout home game for the
Owls], it was a weird feeling to
see all those people in the stadi-
um. But once the game started,
it was like we were at Beaver
Stadium [PSU’s home field].
When we got down, it was like
the whole world was against us.
It became embarrassing.”

Temple does have a tough
schedule on its drive to be a top
Eastern football program. This
season, the team plays only four
home games (Alabama, Penn
State, East Carolina and Boston
College). All but East Carolina are

regularly tough opponents.

’’I think we are at the stage in
our growth that we have to trav-
el,” McNair said. ’’It is probably
more profitable for us to play the

seven road games.”

Although he hasn't been used
as much this season, Arians still
has high praise for his star.

”Todd is every bit as good as
Paul Palmer,” Arians said. ’’I
think he is a first—round draft
choice. His role has changed
drastically this year because our
offense has changed. He has
done a great job of blocking. It's
tough for.a guy who has been a
star to be a team player, but Todd
is a team player all the way.”

Being the backup to an excep-
tional runner may be hard to
swallow, but freshman Gary
Dance, who once ran behind the
blocking of Pitt guard Mark Step-
noski at Erie Cathedral Prep,
doesn't see it that way.

”Todd has been great,” Dance
said. ”He has helped me a lot,
and I try to emulate what he does.
He is a real leader on our football
team, and I hope he has con-
tinued success.”

Pitt defensive end Burt Gross-
man is from the Philadelphia area
and knows McNair. He said he
was a good player, -but he
wouldn't mind beating Temple.

’’I have to see these guys when
I go home, and they never let me
forget when they beat us,” Gross-
man said. ’’I don't know what
their philosphy is, but I think that
McNair should run the ball more.

”He was successful for them on
the ground last season, but they
aren't using him as much now. I
can understand if he was upset
when he only gets the ball five
times a game. That would be like
our coaches taking me out on
passing downs. I wouldn't be too
happy,” Grossman said.

McNair likes playing for Tem-
ple, but the losing still gets him
down.

’’I’m not used to losing. I do get
frustrated easily. It would be nice
if we could challenge for the
championship, but I know that is
out of our reach right now. We
just have to play tough every
game. Not everybody can be a
Miami.”

Nor can everyone have the ta—
lent of Todd McNair.

We would just
like to tell
Roberta Borfolini
that we’re going to
miss her...

Music critics, friends. salespeople and you.

I know the most important part of a stereo

system is the loudspeaker. To improve your

sound. you look for better speakers. You
search all the stores and read all the ads
(including classifieds). You even listen to
hucksters selling great speaker promises from
their vans and car trunks.

Few companies make great speakers.
even fewer are able to make a great
speaker at a low price. BOSTON ACOUSTICS
is an exception to this rule.

o The Boston Acoustics A-60 bookshelf
speaker has been knocking the
competlon dead for the last six years.
Most reviewers consider it the best buy
at its regular price of only $230 per pair.

- The Boston Acoustics A100 is
regarded by most experts as the best
value in a moderately priced full size
speaker at $420 per pair

These and other models of the Boston

Temple

Continued from page 11

It could prove to be an interest-
ing problem for the Pitt defense.

It really doesn't matter what
kind of year Temple is having, be-
cause the Owls have proved to
be trouble for the Panthers the
last two years. Last season, the
Owls triumphed 24-21, thanks in
large part to runningback Todd
McNair’s 213 yards on the
ground.

In 1986, Paul Palmer gave the
Panthers trouble by running for
105 yards on 27 carries to win a
rain-drenched game, 19-13.

”We know a lot of players on
the Pitt team,” McNair said. ’’I
think it's the game that we are

most relaxed in. They are always
a good team; we just have fun
playing Pitt.”

The, Pitt offense, by contrast, is
just starting to come together.
Freshman Curvin Richards has
replaced an injured Adam Walk-
er after the third game and has
had good results. Quarterback
Darnell Dickerson (209 passing
yards last week) has taken control
of the offense and has been able
to move the ball down the field.

”The offensive line is what is
holding the offense together,”
fullback Dan Crossman said.
”They have been together for two
years. Darnell is just Darnell, he
loves to play the game. Plus, we

have some great wide receivers,
and our running game is going
well.”

The Pitt defense has been hit
hard with injuries. Tackle Marc
Spindler is expected to miss at
least one month because of a
knee injury and subsequent sur-
gery. Both Grossman and line-
backer Ricardo McDonald have
been slowed by ankle injuries.

”My ankle feels a lot better this
week than it did last week, so
that's a good sign,” Crossman
said. ’’I don't know how long it
will hold up, so everybody has to
be ready to play.”

”The defense has played well
through all of the injuries, but

we've given up a lot of points,”
Gottfried said. ”That may be a
contradictory statement, but I’m
watching the way we are playing
and I am seeing some good
things. I'm very impressed with
the effort.”

One defensive stalwart has
been middle linebackerjerry Ol-
savsky. He leads the team with
71 tackles (22 against Notre
Dame), 49 of which are unas-
sisted.

”I have seen Olsavsky on
film,” McNair said. ”He is hav-
ing a great year. He fills the holes
quickly. Man, he is tough as
sh—t.”

A ’s not
satisfied
with Series
appearance

By Steve Wilstein
AP Sports Writer

OAKLAND, Calif. — One
look at the dark, fiery eyes of
Tony La Russa or a view of the
Oakland Athletics’ workout is
enough to wipe out any notion
the American League champs
are settling into smugness be-
fore the World Series.

No team in 19 years of
major league playoffs has had
five days off before the start of
the World Series — five days
to get bloated with self-
satisfaction and stale on the
field.

The Athletics worked out for
the second straight day Wed-
nesday, determined to keep
the edge that enabled them to
win eight of 11 after they
clinched the division title Sept.
19, then swept the Red Sox in
four straight.

The team is relaxed and
loose. No one is pressing or
looking anxious. But there is
no mistaking the determina-
tion to complete the goal La
Russa and the players set ear-

ly in the season: to win the _

World Series and not just the
division or pennant.

Or, as La Russa describes it,
to negotiate the final side of
”the pyramid.”

La Russa never let this team
ease up, not when it won 14
straight and 18 of 19 early in
the season and not when it
was breezing to the AL West
championship.

His players maintain the
same focus on winning the
World Series and proving they
are the best in baseball.

The champagne party after
the victory over Boston was
brief and somewhat re-
strained. Jose Canseco had a
few sips of bubbly and
declined another round. Car-
ney Lansford sat by his locker,
utterly happy but holding back
a little.

’’I can remember winning a

division title with the '79
[California] Angels,” said Lans-
ford. ”We were so satisfied
with that, we died in the
playoffs [against the Baltimore
Orioles]. ,

”This year, nobody has said
anything about being satisfied.
That includes right now. We
still have a job to do.”

Canseco is working out this
week as if he still had a lot to
prove, despite his three
homers in the playoffs, 42 dur-
ing the season and 40 stolen
bases.

’’I think our confidence lev-
el has been extremely high,
but we don't try to get so high
to the point where we get ar-
rogant or we come in and take
everything for granted,”
Canseco said.

”We’re going to work hard.
We're going to come out here
every day, running, taking bat-
ting practice, the whole works.
We're not going to lay off just
because we're in the World
Series. There's still a lot of

work to be done.”

After two incendiary hardcore
records for Touch and Go, Mil-
wakee’s Die Kruezen has gone
the Husker Du route of.progres—
sion. Their new disc reveals a

style. Indeed their playing is

liberated.

Fear not, though, Dan Kubinski
can still scream as he aptly
demonstrates. His lyrics this time
around, though, are much more
personal: you know, about love
and all that.

A chat with classic tracks DJ, Sean McDowell

By Melina Antypas
For The Pitt News

He is a Pittsburgh celebrity of“
sorts, but in spite of his ruggedly
handsome good looks, he could
walk down the street without be-
ing noticed. He is known for his
deep, gentle voice. He is the af-
ternoon disc jockey for the
classic—rock radio station WMYG
FM, here in Pittsburgh. He is also
the No. 1 DJ among males aged
18-34. His name is Sean
McDowell.

If that name rings a bell, it
should. Sean andhis father, Al
McDowell, have put in a com-
bined 40 years of Pittsburgh me-
dia experience. The senior
McDowe|l was a prominent
newscaster for both KDKA and

,WTAE television.

Although his father tried to dis-
suade him from going into broad-

casting of the insecurity of the
business, Sean followed his own
fascination with radio. He
switched his major from journal-
ism to radio broadcasting while
at the University of Dayton in
Ohio.

Surprisingly, Sean's first audi-
tion for the student-run radio sta-
tion WVUD in Dayton was
turned down by the program
director and labeled as ”not good
enough.” He settled for the other
station on campus, which hap-
pened to be an educational
station.

After graduation, Sean headed
back to Pittburgh in search of a
radio station. He said there was
never a doubt as to what kind of
station he would work for: rock
’n’ roll.

”The business is becoming
more and more difficult to get
into, especially at my end,” ac-

cording to Sean, ”but it still mat-
ters a great deal as to what you
know [about broadcasting]/’
His advice to aspiring DJs:
”Everybody has to follow their
dream, [but] it isn't really how
good you are, [or] what you can
do; certainly that counts for
something, but it still matters a
great deal  who you know.” Af-
ter working for 21/2 years at his
first job, Sean was fired‘. ‘'1 was
young and rebellious  I wasn't
following the format,” he admit-
ed. Shortly after, he was offered
a job with what was then FM 97,
the station he now works for.
The station changed its format
about two years ago to ’’classic
rock,” from the ’60s—’70s era.
This is Sean's favorite kind of
music. Before the change, the sta-
tion was ranked at the bottom of
the list of Pittsburgh stations by
the Arbitron rating system. It was

recently ranked fourth in the mar-
ket for total listening audience by
the same rating system. The hike
in ratings leaves the station with
a feeling of ”euphoria and confi-
dence,” he stated with twinkling
gray eyes.

The atmosphere of the station
is a relaxed one. It is an unassum-
ing building, Iocated in a
depressed neighborhood. The in-
terior is simple and workable.
The tapes, record albums and
compact discs are piled every-
where for lack of space.
However, the DJs, program direc-
tor, program manager and station
manager are all team players on
a team that is quickly climbing
out of a slump.

’’I love what I do, but it really
is just a job,” claimed Sean, who
also does about three to four
hours of production daily. He
does advertising for concerts, car

 

dealerships, and basically any
type of spot that has to be done
locally. This is not typical of DJs.
Most do three to four hours on
the air and then go home.

Although he truly enjoys the
music he plays, it is not all his
choice. In fact, most is not his
choice at all. The program direc-
tor oversees a daily list of songs
that must be played in order at a
specific time. This prevents the
overplaying of songs.

This daily list is the biggest
complaint among all disc jock-
eys; their format is controlled by
their production managers and
they would prefer more freedom
in choosing their music.

WMYG’s program director Ron»

Reger, however, has outlined a
format that is obviously working
quite well. ‘

Sean, 32, worries where he’s
going to be at age 33, and when
asked what alternatives are open
to him, he replied, ’’I would like
to get into sound editing for tele-
vision production/”Although he
is fearful of cameras, he sent a
tape to MTV back in 1981 when
the video program had just start-
ed. However, he sent an audio
tape intead of a video tape, and,
as a result, never received a reply.

He said he would not audition

I now for the program because it

has become too commercialized
in the past seven years. Sean said
he could also fall back on
”whatever writing talents I might
have left.” He used to enjoy writ-
ing fiction and short stories.

He is decidedly more comfort-
able as an invisible talent than as
a recognized celebrity. Self-
described as ”quiet, reserved and
shy,” he said speaking in front of
small groups still bothers him. He
must emcee a few concerts a

year, but he finds it easier to

speak to large groups.
While he was growing up,

Sean's favorite group was The

Beatles. He still remembers their
first appearance on The Ed Sul-

livan Show. He also favors Led-

Zeppelin, The Who, The Doors,
The Rolling Stones and most of
the performers who were in-
volved in the famous Woodstock
concert held in 1969.

He was 13 when Woodstock
was held and stated excitedly that
if he were able to go back in time,
the '60s is the era he would en-
joy ”hang[ing] out in.” It is obvi-
ous this is something he has given
some thought to. He is well-
informed about the happenings
around the world, both now and
20 years ago. He is equally well-
informed about the music world.

The most important part of a
DJ’s job, according to the con-
scientious broadcaster, is relating
to your audience. This is a fairly
easy task for Sean, because he
falls into the demographic age of
his listeners. He strives daily to
familiarize himself with his au-
dience.

He makes an effort to come
across on the air as a real Pittsbur-
gher. This is also not difficult for
him. He knows the Pirates, the
arts festival, and what it is like to
wait in traffic; this is what he
passes on to his audience. He is
as down-to—earth and calm at
close range as he is on the air
talking to thousands of listeners.
He describes radio as compan-
ionship, and himself as the com-
panion.

Sean disclosed that his first
night on the air with a major ra-

dio station was ”horrible” and it
made him ”more nervous than
you could ever imagine.” He felt
he could not leave the DJ booth
to get a soda for fear the song
would run out while he was
gone. Little did he know that this
private phobia would actually

‘come true.

One of Sean's most memorable
nights on the air was when he
had to answer the call of nature.
He played Don McLean's
”American Pie,” and feeling that
eight minutes was long enough,
retreated to the men's room. The
door knob fell off, the latch
locked itself and Sean was stuck.

A The three other people in the
building wre involved in a meet-
ing and were oblivious to all the
noise Sean was making. He even.-

Ctually kicked the door out after

being off the air for 45 minutes.

After 10 years in the business,
the No. I disc jockey feels more
confident about leaving the booth
during a song. But despite being
a veteran, he still gets nervous ev-
ery day before going on the air,
because ”the public is expecting
something from you [as an enter-
tainer].”

. On the air, he is careful to think

about everything before he says
it, and thus comes across as a
wel|—organized, knowledgeable
and educated personality.

He is a tall, lean man with san-
dy blond hair and a well-
groomed beard that covers a
strong jaw line. He is casual and
would much rather hang out with

5 the locals in Braddock, where the

station is located, than associate
with some of the people his job
forces him to be in Contact with.
He fits in quite well with the lo-
cals in his faded, torn jeans and
equally characteristic denim shirt.

. Sean is enthusiatic when speak-

ing of the similarities between
live radio and the TV show
WKRP in Cincinnati. ”The pub-
Iic would be shocked to see that
[the show] is right on target.” He
smiles wryly as he confides that
he can pick, off the top of his
head, several people he has
worked with who fit the charac-
ter molds of the actors on the

A show.

He is quite happy with his job,
especially now that ”Magic 97,"
as the station is referred to, is do-
ing so well. The latest Arbitron
ratings, the Nielsens of radio,
have proven that this little station
is a challenger. In fact, WDVE,
the only other rock ’n’ roll station
in Pittsburgh,‘ has never been
challenged like this before.

Sean would like to stay with
Magic 97 because he feels well-
received, as his numbers demon-
strate. He is part of a growing cor-
poration and fiercely proud of it.

So, if you enjoy classic rock
and are near a radio station be-
tween 3 and 7 p.m. Monday
through Saturday, tune into 96.9
FM. Or stop by C. J. Barney's
Thursday nights between 9 and 2
and listen to a McDowell tradi-
tion, the gentle voice of a real
Pittsburgher relating to his au-
dience.

If you don't like classic rock, be
on the lookout, because this ”lit-
tle station that could'’ is definite-
ly on the rise, and so is D] Sean
McDowell. ,

Bringing together two antiqui-
ties of the original punk flourish
raises an undisputable memorial
to those that have fallen before
them in the battle to forge a space
in time for the musical style.
Preserving the musical perfection
of these two matured artists
together on vinyl is a tribute to
others from the same lineage.

Instinct lends a pleasant sur-
prise to those that were expect-
ing a tame version of Iggy Pop.
His maturation can be seen not
only in his appropriately phrased
lyrics, but also in his back-to—ba—
sics musical approach. All this
lends itself as evidence that you
can grow older physically
without growing out of your ever-
important ideologies.

Things weren't so bad after all.
I was soaking wet, chilled to the
bone from the mountain air, and
every step in front of me could be
my last, thanks to otherwise un-
detectable plastic Soviet-built
landmines.

May 8, 1987. I was a few
kilometers southeast of the big
airfield at Khost, which is in Pak-
tia province, Afghanistan. My
good buddies of the Mahaz rebel
party had taken me along on the
milk run to Khost because I asked
them to. It was my first attempt
at combat journalism.

The mission in was simply
trudging through rain and mud
on mountain passes. I thought I
was in good shape, but I had to
hang on to the straps of our pack
animals at times as we hiked up
in increasing elevation-. My as-
sociates — in sandals —— would
not slow their pace for me.

The Mahaz are a pro—Western
rebel group who are dedicated to
ridding Afghanistan of Russian
soldiers. Dealing with them
wasn't so difficult, once I got used
to their spokesmen changing
their names every other day and
lying about possessing Stinger
missiles, or blowing off our ap-
pointments. That comes with the
territory.

My contact in the Mahaz was
well placed in their infrastructure,
and he was trusted by confidants
both stateside and in Peshawar.

Attack on

Once again, America's gun
owners find themselves to be the
brunt of unfounded ridicule that
makes abundant use of twisted
opinions with no basis in fact.
The Sept. 29 edition of The Pitt
News carried a column dealing
with the national waiting period
for handgun buyers, the so-called
Brady Amendment, written by
Art Buchwald, a columnist who
for years has tried to be funny
when dealing with different is-
sues. Insults to over three million
people are not funny.

Mr. Buchwald portrayed gun
owners in his article as the stereo-
typical hicks and hoopies that can
do nothing but sit around swill-
ing beer all day long while they
wait to shoot at anything that
moves. This is simply not the
case. As someone who has been
around firearms and people that
share a common interest in them,
I can assure you that gun owners
are not like that. I have seen more
than my fair share of doctors, law-
yers, teachers and other profes-
sionals along with everyday
working men and women that
enjoy the use of firearms.

The national seven-day waiting
period that Mr. Buchwald so
dearly loves would have done ab-
solutely nothing to help combat
violent crime in this nation. Let's
compare the myths with the facts.
Myth: A waiting period would
keep guns out of the hands of
criminals and the mentally ill.
Fact: Criminals and people with
something to hide in their pasts
do not go to gun stores and fill
out the necessary paperwork
when acquiring a gun. They buy
them in back alleys where prices
are cheaper, there are no taxes on

*'then1‘,“ *and "no* "questions “are”

Afghans take responsibility rather
seriously, so my safety with them
was pretty much assured.

The Mission-in had led us to
some bunkers near Khost — the

 

AR  
BROWN

area in which Rambo III was sup-
posed to take place. The area was
fairly secure, irregardless of land-
mines, snipers, and the occasion-
al ambush by Soviet Spetsnaz
commandos. The unseasonally

heavy rain had kept the Mig jets

and armored helicopters ground-
ed that night, so the only real
concern was a doublecross by
Communist infiltrators, or possi-
bly fundamentalist rebels.

My contact kept himself cov-
ered’ with a half dozen mean
looking bodyguards, and I wasn't
sure how close to stay to him if
bullets started flying at close
range. I was the only unarmed

person present, and next to» my
contact, the best trained gun-
slinger there. I swore that was the
last time I'd put myself in that po-
sition.

After a meal and exchanging
intelligence with the Khost rebels,
we all got rained on again as we
watched an armored column
trudge back into their base. That
went on for several hours and
was quite a sight — Soviet tanks
and armored cars driving on a
single road with their headlights
on, firing their cannons and
machine guns off into the dark-
ness at odd angles to provoke a
rebel response.

Just to remind the Soviets
whose neighborhood they were
in and that they were never safe,
the rebels lobbed a half dozen
captured rockets in the direction
of the end of the convoy. That
picked up everyone’s morale,
and after farewells, we trudged

back toward the Pakistan border. '

I was shivering from the cold
and the rain, but felt good inside.
I assumed my place in our
column, about 50 meters behind
my contact’s headquarters ele-
ment. The initial march on
mission-out was mainly down in
elevation, so it was easy going.

Until 20 minutes later, when I
heard a sound that made me glad
that dysentery had not set in yet:
incoming Katyusha rockets.

On reflex, I immediately fell

into the mud and covered my
head with my arms. The first ex-
plosion shook the mountainside,
causing many of our pack
animals to bolt from their han-
dlers. The freight train whoosh of
the next rocket preceded its im-
pact, literally moving the earth
under me as shrapnel and rocks
flew up and out. Then came the
noise of the explosion.

There was no point in running,
that would increase my vulnera-
bility. I didn't want to look like
the six pack animals which lay
screaming in the mud with their
intestines run through with
shrapnel.

The unseen rocket battery was
barraging the length of our trail.
They didn't know our exact po-
sition, but since there were only
so many trails in that area, their
policy was to bracket. The closest
rocket to me was 70 meters
away, lower down the mountain.

In 20 minutes time, we caught
200 rockets. Once the barrage
ended, I tried to set the land
speed record back to Pakistan as
the Mu/ahideen and I got out of
the kill’ zone. The terror of the
life-stealing rockets lent me new
definitions of the word adrena-
line. I wanted to live.

editor forThe Pitt News.

gun owners was unwarranted

asked. Another myth conveyed in
a ”humorous” way was Mr.
Buchwald’s comment about
police not knowing anything,
”they just want to prevent them-
selves from being killed.” The FBI
has stated consistently over the
past 10 years that between 60
and 83 percent of police mur-
dered are murdered with their
own guns. [Neither] I, nor any
other gun owner or NRA mem-
ber poses any threat to police
officers. That is why police have
consistently supported our posi-
tion since the NRA’s inception in
1871.

Mr. Buchwald also very con-
veniently forgot to mention that
the NRA offered the compromise
bill that established a fair way for
gun sellers to check prospective
buyers. The bill, written by Rep.
Harold Volkmer, R—Mo., ordered
the Justice Department to set up
a system that allows gun sellers
to check into a central computer
file that determines a person's
eligibility for buying a gun, based
on their criminal record and psy-

chological record. This system_

will most likely be like the system
used to clear credit cards for use
in stores. However, the Brady
Amendment would not only have
mandated a seven-day waiting
period, [...] it would have set up
a national system of registration,
which would be quite a useful
tool if the government wanted to
make it illegal for Americans to
own firearms. It would have
given police unprecedented pow-
er to arbitrarily turn down any-
one, no matter what their record
was, without any chance for ap-
peal. Finally, the bill would have
given the police the right to come

“to ‘your’ home‘ to’ "checks ‘your ~

house and property; to judge
whether or not you are fit to own

' a firearm. [...]

I am a gun owner and proud of
it. Gun owners are just as respon-
sible as anyone else, more so
than a great many. To Sarah Bra-
dy and Art Buchwald, I have one
thing to say: Get your facts
straight for once and leave Ameri-
ca’s law-abiding citizens alone.

Junk sculpture

[...]

Where did that monstrosity in
Forbes Quadcome from? Who
built it? (I do stress built, not
created.) And did any of my tu-
ition go toward funding that
thing? (I say thing in place of any
number of pejorative terms
which would not likely be
printed.)

I'm not an art major (or an in-
dustrial engineer), but every
morning now, I'm going to have
to walk by Forbes Quad on my
way to my 10:00 history class
and have my senses assaulted by
this mammoth pseudo-sculpture.

Just staring at the picture of it
on the cover of The Pitt News the
other day reminded me of the
children's story ”The Emperor's
New Clothes.” You know, the
one where the king walks around
naked but everyone is conned
into believing he's wearing the
finest robes in the kingdom.

I guess the one good function
the ”sculpture” (and I use that
term loosely) will serve is to keep
those artist types (recognizable by

their black‘ ‘clothing ~iand~ long -

brown cigarettes) occupied in an
inconspicuous part of campus. I
saw some staring at the object in
awe just [recently]. (At least it
looked like awe; it could have
been constipation, though.) ,
So, could someone please tell
me if I involuntarily funded that

huge, yellow, upside-down ”Y”~

in Forbes Quad, or was it simply
a donation from some psychotic
monolith architect or well-
intentioned ”artist"?

Biased Quayle bashing

I am writing in response to Ms.
Jessica CoIville’s ”Disturbing
facts about Quayle” article of
Oct. 5. As expected, this article
conforms to the hackneyed liber-
al line to which The Pitt News so
depressingly adheres. Your
paper's incessant denigration of
Sen. Quayle and his character
when compared with your fawn-
ing over Gov. Dukakis betrays a
decided lack of balance. This
might be forgivable if any of your
attempts at journalism were lea-
vened with even a modicum of
wit.’ Instead, Pitt students are
offered only an abysmally tedious
publication bereft of intellectual
content. [...]

Your ignorance of Vice Presi-
dent Bush's policies is appalling.
Mr. Bush has been entirely lucid
and candid concerning his views.
[...] Quayle has spent 12 years in
the United States Congress shap-
ing and debating foreign and
domestic policy. Dukakis has no
governmental experience beyond
that of the state level [...].

The low enthusiasm was part-

who filed a $6 million wrongful

death civil suit against the

, unknown driver in February, con-
tends the attorney-client privilege ’
does not permit lawyers to with-
hold vital information during
criminal investigations.

”He is harboring a fleeing fel-
on according to the law,” said
Joseph D. Farish Jr.

Only relatives are not required
to turn in a known criminal, Far-
ish said. _/

Baltes’ parents, who have sat

month, also are exasperated at ef-
forts to learn the name.

’’I’m getting the lawyer—client
privilege up to here,” Mildred
Baltes said. ’’It certainly doesn't
help solve any cases.”

The Balteses earlier this year
even agreed to allow state prose-
cutors to offer the driver immu-
nity from criminal — but not civil
— prosecution if the person came
forward.

The case has prompted ethical
debates among legal scholars and
attorneys.

Geoffry Hazard Jr., a professor
of ethics at Yale Law School, said
most interpretations of the
attorney-client privilege say only
conversations between the two
parties are confidential.

’’If there was ever a case to test
the sanctity of the attorney—client
privilege, this one is it,” said Har-
vard University Law School
Professor Andrew Kaufman,
author of a book on legal ethical
responsibility. ’’In most disputes
over the attorney-client privilege,
the identity is known and the
contents of the conversations are
L not. What makes this case unique

j is that it is just the opposite.”

State committee to make guidelines on home education

HARRISBURG (AP) ~ A House
committee on Wednesday ap-
proved a bill that would establish
formal guidelines for home
schooling in Pennsylvania.

The House Education Commit-
tee, working to beat the Legisla-
ture’s Nov. 30 adjournment
deadline, gutted an almost

Q-year-old Senate bill and unani-
mously voted to insert the home
school language.

The new version moved to the
House floor.

Education Committee Chair-
man Ronald Cowell, D-Al-
legheny, said another bill
containing home-school provi-
sions was approved earlier this

each case separately, because ”it
is often extremely difficult to
draw the line between sex edu-
cation for children and kiddie
porn.”

She cited D. H.~ Lawrence and
James Joyce as artists who were
victims of censorship.

In the past, the ACLU fought for
voting rights for blacks in the

‘South. It was also the first nation-

al organization to question the in-
ternment of_Japanese—Americans
during World War II.

Students say that lines are

longer than last year because of
a bigger freshman class and a
larger number of people purchas-
ing meal plans.

The ACLU is a non-profit or-

‘ﬁanization that is funded primar-

ily through donations, fund
raising events and membership
dues. It receives no financial sup-
port from the government.

The board feels that not only
extending cafeteria hours but also‘
‘stopping delays could be a suita-
ble solution..

SGB———-

A letter will be going to Dr.‘

Chesler, President of the Faculty
Senate, expressing SGB’s disap-

tpointment over a $500,000 ap-

propriation from the state to go
toward financial aid for students
and faculty salaries.

Jackson said, ”This money was
to go towards these two interests,
but it is my strong belief that
most, if not all, of this money will
go toward faculty salaries.”

Tuition was raised in part last
summer due to the increase In

Qfaculty salaries. Jackson is going

to let Dr. Chesler know the
board's disappointment concern-
ing this plan and hopes that in the
future students’ needs are taken
into account.

Jackson stated, ’’I am very dis-
appointed with the lack of
response [from] the student body
— to run for a student govern-
ment position with only one stu-

? dent running for President and 11

for the Board doesn't say much
for the student body as a whole.’’

year by the committee but stalled
in the House.

Cowell said the new version
addresses ”95 percent” of the
concerns expressed by parents.
He said the home-schooling con-
cept also is generating more sup-
port among legislators.

”l think a consensus is develop-
ing that the school code ought to
give recognition to home school-
ing as a legitimate form of edu-
cation,” he said.

In addition to the legislative
deadline, a federal district judge
in August ruled that present lan-
guage in the state's school code
concerning private tutors was un-
constitutionally vague and must

 

COFFEE  

be reworked by Dec. 31. _

Some districts required home
school teachers to be a ”proper—
ly qualified private tutor” without
clearly defining private tutor,
Cowell said.

He said the new bill more
clearly defines a private tutor and
what a parent or guardian is re-
quired to teach their children at
home.

Under the bill, a parent or guar-
dian must submit a notarized af-
fidavit to the school super-

intendent each year outlining’

what will be taught. The affidavit
must include proof that the child
has been properly immunized

care and that the teacher or any
adult living in the home has not
been convicted of certain crimi-
nal offenses.

In order to prove the student is
learning, the teacher each year
would have to submit a portfolio
of the student's work and either
the results of a standardized test
or an examination by a certified
school psychologist.

The bill allows superintendents
to request additional proof during
the year if they believe a program
is not working.

Cowell said the bill also gives

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, October l3, i988

lCampus '5 Club Concourse gives students chance to dance...

By Jennifer Moritz
re» The Pitt News

The Club Concourse, Pitt's
unden21
something for every student

' who enjoys music, whatever

style it may be.

From dancing to progressive
music, banging your head to
heavy metal, or mellowing out
with a cigarette to the sounds
of jazz, you are likely to find
the Club Concourse a worth-
while way to spend a Friday
evening.

As an alternative to alcohol-
ic bars and nightclubs, the

nightclub, offers ‘

Club Concourse provides Pitt
students with a chance to hear
popular local bands without
the worries of the LCB and
high cover charges.

Sponsored by the Pitt Pro-
gram Council, the Club Con-
course is open every Friday
from 9 p.m. until midnight on
the lower level of the William
Pitt Union.

Admission is free to all stu-
dents with a Pitt ID, since it is
covered by the student activi-
ties fee paid by students at the
start of each term. Non—Pitt stu-
dents are allowed only as
guests of a Pitt student and are

charged $2 upon entry.

Since its opening last Janu-
ary, the Club Concourse has
hosted a variety of area bands,
playing rap to reggae. Past
bands have included The
Sponges, Johnny Rhythm and
the Dimestore 45s, The
Garden, The 11th Hour and
area recording artists The Af-
fordable Floors.

According to Dana Keefer,

_ program coordinator for the

PPC, they want to get a varie-
ty of bands to play the club to
attract Pitt students with varied
musical tastes. She added that

many local nightclubs like
Graffiti only offer one type of
music and attract one type of
crowd.

’’I think it's good for stu-
dents to get diversified mu-
sic,” said Keefer. ”There are
always different groups of peo-
ple that attend the shows at the
Club Concourse.”

Attendance at the Club Con-
course fluctuates depending
on the band that is playing, ac-
cording to PPC student coor-
dinator Melanie Naro. When
The Affordable Floors played

last January, students had to be
turned away for lack of room

in the concourse area, which ‘

fits up to 250 people.

So far this term, attendance
has been good, with over 150
students attending the shows
each of the past three Fridays.

The PPC committee that
runs the Club Concourse is
chaired by senior Michael
Damp and is respnsible for
transforming the atmosphere
of the lower level of the Pitt
Union into that of a dance
club or concert hall.
