An esthusiastic group of about 75:
persons attended, ih-er opening lecture}
of the, Life Insurance Cours_e in Thaw
Hall at 3:30 ofclock Monday after-
noon. The course consists of a series
of seven publi _ lectures, given by
Charles VV. Sco el‘, -A. M., chairman
of the Committee on Alumni ‘Organ-
izations and former President of the
National Association of Underwriters.
The course will be given under the
auspices of the Pittsburgh Life Under-
writer’s Association. D Ten sessions of
class instruction ;will be in charge of
Prof. Ira G. Flocken of the School of
Economics.

The course was arranged for?,Mon-
day afternoon in‘ order that the stu-
dents of the University might take ad-
vantage of -this opportunity to hear
Mr. Scovel, who is an authority on the
subject. The growinginterest in life
insurance also adds to the value of
-suc-h7a,_course. ;Univers’ity credit is"
given tostudents upon the sa.tis~factory
completion of the course. ,

Mr. e;Scoveli-explained that the idea»
of the lectures is to..supp1emen‘t and
complement words in textbooks. He

insurance, its value as" an economic
force, as a worldwide ‘institution, be-
yond that which a text book can give.
The ,. lectures will be non-professional
'_ and non‘-technical, . especially adapted
for the business man. Such a series of
(talks was given. by me at Syracuse
-University recently 1 and nearly’, 400-
Vptudents turned out to hear them. It
Vis’\hoped that axlarge number here
willavail themselves of the oppor-
tunity.”r. I . - l
The program of the course is as

Inn NEW MEMBERS

The “Get a Member” plan which A

 

wasvadopted by the Alumni Council at
its last meeting, is working" like a

charm and no less-than 29 new mem-z 1‘

bers have been garnered by itgsince
the January meeting. At -this; meet-

ing, every zcncmber of Council pledged.

himself to try hard to secure at least
one member of the Association before
the March meeting and from the pres-
ent outlook it appeals as though every’
member will make good. Sdrne of the

Council members have secured three

or four members.

V The secretary ‘will follo,w”up this ,
plan carefully and letters will go out ‘

about the ‘mid-dle ‘of Febtggiary -to all

‘who have-not secured one or more, I

members. Itis. ﬁgured that -it is a

very easy matter ,_to get at least one
member among Pitt associates; and‘_

sINIuIIsnI 1915    

friends, and withthe Council men en-
tering intothe plan with enthusiasm,

its ultimate ‘success is assured. D

It is hoped that when the ‘March:
-meeting is held atithe l’. A. .A., the
secretary will be able to report that

every member of Cohncil made good
_ This will
‘mean an increased membership of a
least 50 for-the Association. I

NOTES ‘OF THE ’GREfENhSBUhRG'
‘ IMIEETING. V

 

Dr. J. S. Crawford, ’72, the -oldest
alumnus present, takes a lively inter-
est in his Alma Mater. A conversa-
tion’ .t_he'Se‘cretary had. with him indi-
cates that he is -genuine football fan

and has followed the activities of our 7

grid team closely fora number of
years. Dr. Crawford-graduated from
the Scientiﬁc course at W. U. P. later

‘studying medicine in Philadelphia. ‘ A

‘ Dr. 1w. w. Miller, '92, thenew pres-
ident of the Club, is one of the lead-
ing physicians of Jeannette. . 6

The‘ re-election of Dr. ‘B. F.,Jenkins,
’06, as secretary and treasurer of the
Club. was a wise move. Dr. Jenkins
has been a ver,y‘,eﬂi.cient officer and
has the affairs of the‘ Club in good
shape. ’ . ' ., .

Wilbur Hockensmith didn’t forget
to boost football in his talk. He claims
-the «grid game has donemo-re to boost
the University than any other thing.

 

, .

The‘ Glee Club quartet composed of
Messrs. Tucker, Canan, Pollock and
Franklin, made a. great bit. So did
Jack Thompson, with some‘ of his
famous “readings. ” .

worked. very well.  .. 1

Schenley, February 16th, is the next

posed, of some to the alumni. The
“grad” representation promises to be
larger than usual. The “Prom” is a
University affair entirely and gives
the “grads” agood opportunity to mix
with the “undergrads” and get better
acquainted. Thecommittee in charge
states the 1916 “Prom” will be the
“best ever.” , -
