Experts share mixed winter predictions

. Old Man Winter seems to finally be

knocking on Oak1and’s door. ,

Though this November has seemed
to be a rather mild one, with daily highs
reaching nearly 70 degrees on multiple
occasions, meteorologists maintain that
this month’s weather is just as it should
be — actually a bit colder.

This month’s average daily high tem-
perature has hovered aroundv52' degrees,
just 2 degrees more than the all—time

measures close to the overall average,-

sinking 2 degrees lower than November’s
usual 34-degree mark. i

Despite" the normal fall weather,
WTAE TV Pittsburgh’s chief meteorolo-
gist Stephen Cropper warned that this
winter could be “a bit harsher than usual
for Southwest Pennsylvania.”

Still, Pittsburghers should not expect
a repeat of last year’s freak snow storms

The Big East added a new member Mona-

the biggest draw being their football
program — currently No. 3 in the BCS
rankings. A

The move was facilitated by TCU

Conte about how the league was looking
for another football member.

_After discussions with Del Conte,
Dixon informed Big East Commissioner

Pitt’s promotional materials declare, “The city is
our campus,” but come March, students might
have trouble getting to parts of it by bus.

Pitt students arrived back in Oakland after
break to news that the Port Authority would
cut more than 30 percent of its bus routes at
the end of March. The Port Authority also plans
to hike fares and reduce service in general at
that time. V

The service cut will include the reduction of

some routes and the complete elimination of
others. In addition, some buses will not operate
on certain days of the week, in particular on the
weekends.

Several dozen communitieswilllose PortAu—
thority service altogether, and although Oakland
is not one of them, campus life will still likely
change.

The free bus rides that Pitt students receive
with their Panther Cards will not be affected
by the cuts. Butjim Ritchie, director of public
relations at the Port Authority, said that all bus
routes will be affected in some capacity.

Diana Edwards, a 20-year PortAuthority rider
and employee of the University of Pittsburgh at
UPMC Monteﬁore hospital, was not concerned
with the new changes but hopes that they will
lead to alternate transportation options.

“I guess the Port Authority is trying to be
more efficient Hopefully it will encourage more
biking,” Edwards said. “But of course biking is
not feasible in the winter.”

Some Pitt faculty are concerned for those
who rely regularly on the Port Authority system.
Katz Business School professor Russ Robbins
said these changes are just part ofhow the world
works. «

“They have to do what they have to do. I just
hope that when deciding what routes to cut, they
ﬁilly considered the individuals who strongly
rely on public transportaﬁon for everyday things
such as getting to work and getting to a doctor’s

appointment,” Robbins said.

Some Pitt students shared the same senti-
ment.

“Many of the people who rely on Port Author-
ity are living in the areas where the bus routes will

The Pittsburgh Port Authority plans to reduce service by at least 30 percent next year in light-of a $40 million budget deﬁcit.

be eliminated. How are these people supposed
to get to work? Buy groceries? Run errands?”
Pitt junior Hilary Nykwest asked.
Others do not foresee these changes as hav-
ing a large effect on the transportation system.
Jessica Schrand, a Pitt sophomore, uses the bus
system to get to and from her work in Down-
town. “I feel as if it won’t cause a huge change
to the current situation. I just hope they don’t
change the bus numbers again,” shesaid.

With the routes being cut, many in the com-
munity have argued that sustainable transporta-
tion altematives must be found. ’

Senior Erin Ross uses Port Authority to get
to herjob Downtown about three days perweek
and considered the ﬁiture changes.

“I guess I will have to grab a taxi late at night

O said.

on the weekends or drive myself. There are al-
ready enough times when I have to run out of
work to catch the 2 a.m. buses,” Ross said.

“What they should do is heavily .cut back
on the day services and try to avoid cutting the
morning and early evening services from the
time of 4 to 6:30 [p.m.],” Edwards said. “The
buses are already crowded enough at those
times.” _

Ritchie said the Port Authority’s board of di-
rectors voted on the decision and that the service
reductions will deﬁnitely occur in 2011.

“Unless [the state] resolves the issue with
their transportation budget, the decisions
made by the board will not be reversed,” Ritchie

Earlier this yearthe Port Authority reported

a deﬁcit of more than $40 million in the 2011
annual operating budget. The deﬁcit came from
afailure of the state to fund the Port Authority’s
budget, according to the organization’s budget
documents available online. The proposed rout
and services changes will ﬁll that gap.

Act44, the state transportation ﬁindingbill,
originally included revenue from tolling I-80,
whichwas not approved by the Federal Highway
Administration. Since that plan fell through,
the state has not increased funding to the Port
Authority.

« Ritchie said cuts will continue to occur each
year if alternate, sustainable revenue sources
are not found. The board is already reviewing
the budget for the following year and anticipates
another signiﬁcant reduction, he said. I

La Nina affects winter  

Winter will be effected by ocean currents, temperatures

Weather 4 1

Meteorologist Alicia Smith with the
National Weather Service in Pittsburgh
predicted that Southwest Pennsylvania
will have a slightly milder winter than
usual this year, whereas Northwest and
Eastern Pennsylvania’s winters will be
comparably normal.

These predictions are from the Na.-
tional Weather SerVice’s most recent
three-month outlook, which covers from
December to February —'- the period con-
sidered to. be the heart of Pittsburgh’s
winter. .

Smith did agree with Cropper that
last year’s Snowpocalypse was a rare
kind of storm’ and said that the region
likely won’t experience another within
the next fewmonths. '

-Smith» based her prediction for a
milder Winter largely on seasonal ocean
currents. -

Right now the region is amid La Nina,

. one oftwo main ocean current patterns,
the other being its more famous coun-

terpart, El Niﬁo.
The ocean- currents affect wind pat-

terns, which in turn_ affect temperature

and.precipitation for North America,
Smith said.
During La Niﬁa, the surface tem-

e perature of ocean water in the Paciﬁc

cools. This cool water increases trade
winds over the Paciﬁc, which blow in-
land and- increase precipitation on the
West Coast and in the Midwest of the
United States.

Accordingly, El Niﬁo refers to a pe-

riod of warming of Pacific Ocean surface
temperatures and the formation of high
pressure fronts blowing over the United
States from the West. '

These currents are some ofthe trends .

and patterns meteorologists look at to
help forecast full winters at a time, as
opposed to forecasting on a daily or
weekly basis. I

Cropper said that when forecasting on
a long-term basis,‘it is more important
to look at past trends and occurrences
than current ones.

In other. words, when trying to pre-
dict the weather patterns for this winter,
meteorologists don’t concern themselves
as much with how this October and No-
vember’s weather has played out as they
do with how last October and Novem—_
ber’s weather played out.

I Along with La Niﬁa and El Niﬁo, mete-
orologists also consider the inﬂuence of
jet streams, hurricanes, tropical storms

"and solar energy on temperature and

precipitation rates before telling us all
how to dress for the day and how much
we should expect to be-shoveling once
winter does hit. .

Cropper said the main aspect ofpre—
dicting weather on a seasonal basis, and
of meteorology in general, is making

educated guesses. This leads to there

being an inherent imperfection in the

science — no one can guess correctly -I

all the time.

“It’s a career. of guesswork,” he
said. I a

Flood, wind
alerts in

Pittsburgh  
Storms to roll into City today

Michael Macagnone
' News Editor

A series of storms could bring high winds
and ﬂooding to the Pittsburgh area to-
day, according to the National Weather
Service. ’ i

The organization issued a high wind
advisory and ﬂood watch starting early
this morning. _ -

' Wind gusts could exceed 45 miles per
hour and widespread rain could cause
rivers and streams to rise and possibly
ﬂood low lying ar-eas, according to the
alert.

Following the alert, Nationalweather
Service meteorologist Charlie Woodrum
said that wind gusts exceeding 50 miles
per hour could make driving difficult,
and some tree branches might break dur-
ing the storm. ‘ . - -

The wind advisory extends until
noon. '

The wind likely‘won’t be able to seri-
ously damage trees or cause large power
outages, according to Woodrum.

He predicted that the only local out-
ages would be caused by downed tree
branches. ,

' Woodrum also recommended that
residents move or secure loose outdoor
items around theirhomes.

Despite the issuing of a ﬂood watch,
the heavy and widespread rain likely
won’t cause ﬂooding on streets beyond
small puddles, Woodrum said.

Students

whipped

First college students were going loko and
now they’re getting whipped.

With the recent FDA ban on Four’Loko
and other major brands of caffeinated al-
coholic beverages, we weren’t surprised to
see college administrators concerned about
an alcohol-infused whipped—cream product
called Whipped Lightning, or “Whipahol.”

According to the product’s website, it is
the world’s ﬁrst alcohol—infused whipped
cream. 9

With 18 percent alcohol —— more than
three times the amount found in most beer
cans — in each $9.99 container, “college
campus leaders are concerned that the
new ‘whipped cream product poses a seri-
ous threat to college students because many
students use the whipped cream on drinks
already induced with alcohol such as Jell-O
shots,” reports Chicago’s WGN News.

Are we likely to see the alcoholic whipped
cream — which comes in ﬂavors like white
chocolate raspberry, cinnamon and coconut
— banned next?

One major difference between Four Loko
and Whipahol is the presence of caffeine.
According to the FDA, the combination of
caffeine and alcohol found in alcoholic en-
ergy drinks led to their users reaching a state
of “wide awake drunk.” Whipahol doesn’t
pose this risk.

Q inions

et

In addition, one of the appeals of Four
Loko was its cheapness. At nearly $10 a
can, Whipahol seems like more of a novelty
than a way for students to get trashed on
the cheap.

For several reasons, we hope that-it

‘doesn’t face the same scrutiny that Four

Loko did.

First of all, we thinklthe product will
make stereotypical foreplay a little more’

interesting. ,

In addition, we have to wonder where the
responsibility line will be drawn;

At what point do we get to claim respon-
sibility for our own decisions rather than
asking the government or campus leaders
to make them for us?‘ .

Are we really not capable of decidin
whether downing an entire can of alcoholic
whipped cream is a good idea? _

Sure, there are downsides to a product
like this. Law enforcement officials might
not be able to quickly recognize whether
the whippedcream is alcoholic, and there is
always the danger of children mistaking it for
their ordinary sundae topping, Reddi—wip.

But as college students, we need a little
less parenting from school administrators

and agencies like the FDA. College campus

leaders should encourage and prepare stu-
dents to make their own decisions. I

Pessimism affects policy

Youth optimism needed to keep older generations in check

Nick Stamatakis
Columnist

If I learned anything this Thanksgiving,
it was that old people are grumpy about
things.

From personal weight issues to “kids
these days” to how big candy bars used
to be, there are a lot "of things to_ be con-
cerned about if you are more than‘5o
years old, apparently. _

I don’t mean this in disrespect, ei-

' ther. Aging is inherently nostalgic, and

there is» nothing wrong with people who
are nostalgic feeling somewhat negative
about the future. It is something that just
sort of happens. The past always seems

rosy, and the future can seem uncertain
and negative. ‘
This is even true among younger
people.’ Many college-aged people to-
day have pessimistic thoughts about
this generation’s young teens. While we
nostalgically evoke playing tag until sun-

down and watching Nickelodeon, we see

kids today addicted to cell phones and
Hannah Montana and can’t help but to
think the worst for tomorrow..

_ So when vacancy signs appear on old
stores, mergers and acquisitions end
established corporations and unexp-
ployment hovers at uncomfortably high

What is really wron

Liberals stereotyped as weak and pretentious krLow—it—alls

Andrew Kaback
Columnist

The election is over. Now let’s forget about i

it please. Let it roll right off your shoulder
quicker than a Rob Thomas song. Let the
conservatives enjoy their Tea Party and
watch as John Boehner sparks the largest
self—tanner buying craze in history.

We all knew it was going to happen
— and if you didn’t, then CNN gave you
enough roundtable discussions to teach
King Arthur he needed to get a patent.

So now that we’re back to doing what
liberals are so good at doing —— ignoring,
the obvious and being sad about losing —
it’s time for us to put down the talk about
Democrats and Republicans and ask_,our—
selves, “What is really wrong with liberal-
ism?” Over the past few years of Obama’s
presidency, we have been bombarded with
cries about the big bad “liberal agenda.”

There are perceptions of almost every
political group that just stick to them: from
the NRA’s inability to read nine out of the
10 amendments to the Sierra Club and its
borderline love affairs with forests. For
liberals, the common stereotypes seem to
include characteristics of weakness and
pretentious know—it-alls.

Now some of you might wonder what
exactly the impetus for this realization is.

Haven’t liberals always been characterized
as Popeye without his spinach?

Well, in the past few weeks, Keith Olber—
mann, a liberal newscaster, was suspended
for making campaign contributions without
consulting his employer. My ﬁrst response
to this news was actually kind of angry.

Would Fox News have dropped Glenn
Beck for a similar offense? Hell no! In fact
if they tried to, Beck would most likely
storm back on air in his Halloween cos-

tume of a uniform that he uses for book

taki. Liberals used to be the Roosevelts and
Wilsons of the world, the Kennedys staring
Russia in the face and not blinking! What
have we let our perceptions become?

I don’t know how much the American
education system teaches about Eugene
V. Debs, but I think that we need a history
check. Debs was the leader of the Socialist
Party of America and ran for president of
our country a number of times. 5

As he had the word “Socialist” next to
his name in the prime of the Red Scare,

We’re back to doing What liberalsare so
good at doing - ignoring the Obvious and

covers and say something ignorant about
minorities.

Well, as a pretentious liberal, I decided
that I was OK with what happened, as NBC
was just enforcing its rules. But less than
three shows after he was removed, Olber-
mann was brought back on! Liberals really
are wimps.

Everything that happens just asserts
that we liberals are better suited for a Phish
concert than for any confrontation. I feel
like that kid on “Hey Arnold!” that kept
getting punched in the face by Helga Pa-

Debs was largely written off by the politi-
cal mainstream. He was thrown in jail and
called a traitor to his country. By the end
of the era of Roosevelt and the New Deal,
the same ideas that had him imprisoned
were credited with saving this country from
economic disaster. V

So when I look at the current political
landscape, I get pretty scared. I see‘Sarah
Palin lashing out at liberals and branding
us as Socialists. Funny, considering she’s
from Alaska, where the state owns its vast
energy resources and disperses the wealth

to its residents. , '

Maybe she should ﬁnd a dictionary'be-
fore she tries to “refudiate” me. I see Bill
O’Reilly calling us Fascists forbelieving that
Intelligent Design should not be taught as
science. Isee liberalism being slandered
into a dirty word.

Liberals should be at war. Although I
realize that liberals are about as good at
battle as Lindsay Lohan is at staying clean,
it’s time to defend "ourselves.

It’s time to stand up for the need for
health-care reform in this country. It’s
time for us to realize the need for increased
spending on science, and education. It’s
time for us to ﬁght ‘against unnecessary
wars. It’s time for.lil§erals to step up and

stop this barrage "gt/Jfattacks on our ideals.

Glenn Beck rallied restore honor. John

als now need to rallyetosrestore our pride.
There is nothing wrong with having lib-

rates, it is natural that older Americans
feel the most negative about the future.
The past was great, and now everything
is changing.

This was highlighted in a recent USA
Today/Gallup poll, which asked respon-
dents if today’s young people will have as

. good ofa future as their parents. In the

results, 51 percent ofpeople overall felt
this to be the case, but people older than
50 were decidedly less optimistic. The
most optimistic were people younger
than 30.

Considering that this over-50 contin-
gent of the population will only increase
in size as baby boomers age, an interest-
ing trend emerges for the next decade
— the country might get less optimistic
just because it will be getting older. The
actual state of the country might stay
the same, or even improve, but just by
virtue ofpeople getting older, polls like
this will make it seem like things are
getting worse. It’s quite a simple idea.
Disproportionately more people will be

thinking about ﬁve-cent Hersheybars
and disproportionately fewer people
will be naive college kids.

And it isn’t just an American phenom— ’

enon that older citizens tend to be less
optimistic about the future. One poll
found German youth to be dispropor-
tionately optimistic about their country
and personal economic prospects, and
young Afghanis are proving to be the
least cynical about the prospects of the
fledgling democracy. ’

This might seem like an irrelevant
discussion. Polls, after all, arejust polls
—- so what if they say we are less opti-
mistic. Besides, just because people get
less optimistic as they age doesn’t mean
that their feelings shouldn’t count. The
discussion can seem purely academic.

But this is not the case. These polls
affect the nation’s psyche, which in
turn affects the nation’s policy. Sens-
ing a population dreading the future and
yearning for the simpler past, feeling the
country is somehow past its prime, Con-

V gres-s migh._t promoteless risk and more

caution in its legislation. Less open to

bigpgchange, the aging population might

find this desirable.
But to see the outcome of this ap-
proach and the dangers of an old coun-

try, one need look nofurther tlianjapan. I

Once a healthy, vibrant country, Japan is
getting old — the average age is almost
45 years, nearly 8 years more than the
average age of inhabitants of the United
States. As such, policy in the country in
many ways is lethargic and sluggish.

Think about this Thanksgiving when
you watched that lovable great uncle‘
of yours fall asleep in the recliner. His
health might not be perfect and his house
might not be in the best shape, but hey,
he’s happy and content for now. Japan
is much like this uncle — it faces steep
deflation, a rapidly aging workforce,
enormous public debt and a chronically
underperforming economy but is just
fine muddling along for now because,
you know, it’s Japan.

about future

Andmakellnol mistake — it isn’t op-.

timism that  magically get
betterthat is driving this inaction.-A V
' It is largely apathy and the lack of
collectivewill to address the problems.

Japan had too much turkey in the 1980s '

— in the form of a real estate bubble
— and today just sitsaround, slowly
declining. ' g .

America too, could face the same
problems as it ages. An aging popula-
tion can start simply feeling negatively
about the future but from there can move
toward apathy and defeat. Not only will

polls say Americans are less optimistic -

about the future, but policy and collec-
tive will could deteriorate.
So at Christmas, when you see the

family again, remember that talking.

about how great old TV was isn’t just
a personal hang-up, but a symptom of
aging that could potentially creep into
the nation’s psyche without a healthy
dose of youthful optimism.

“Punk visual thrash.” _

That’s the only way Delta Spirit bass-
ist Jon Jameson can describe his band’s
style of music.

Founded roughly ﬁve years ago, Delta
Spirit has developed its own genre of folk-
tinged punk —— a sound that has lately been
gaining notice in indie-rock circles.

Jameson and drummer Brandon Young
said the boys of Delta Spirit — named
after _]ameson’s uncle’s taxidermy store
— formed the band out of sheer coinci-
dence. After Young met lead singer Matt

Vasquez while Vasquez was singing on
the street, Young, Vasquez and Jameson
~ began performing together. Soon, former

producer Kelly Winrich was added to the
lineup.

“Things worked out really well. We
all knew we wanted to play together,”
Jameson said of the band’s formation.
“[Music] isn’t the easiest way to make
money, but we keep trying to make a ca-
reer out of it.” ‘ _

and Cold War Kids, Delta Spirit’s soul-

ful Americana-meets-punk formula has
become increasingly popular across the
country e— even as their music continues
to evolve. _

“It’s kind of ever—changing,” Young
said of the band’s style. “But every record
is very loud and experimental.”

Delta Spirit’s lyrics have a distinct
spiritual element. Young insists that the
band isn’t interested in religion in itself,

‘ but more the path to discovering one’s

personal beliefs. ,

FOOD COLUMN
Simkin: The
possibilities.

 

of leftovers

Sarah Simkin
Columnist

Thanksgiving leftovers have become al-
most as muchof a holiday tradition as the
meal itself. Unfortunately, many people”
don’t fully utilize their post—Thursday-
night fridges.

Anyone can slap a turkey sandwich
together, but with a little more creativ-
ity, you might be surprised at how many
variations on the theme you can come up
with. What can you do with that stock of
leftovers? For starters, experiment with
the following recipes:

Soup: What’s better for a blustery
winter day than soup? Swap chicken and
noodles for turkey and corn — which is
pretty much what it sounds like: add egg
noodles and the broth of your choice to

leftover corn and turkey —— or turkey and

tomatoes, carrots, peas and celery.

Salad: For an excellent light lunch, try
turkey salad. Chop up your preference of
light or dark meat as fine as possible. Add
a judicious bit of mayonnaise and your
favorite mix—ins — I’m partial to cranber-
ries and walnuts. Eat the salad by itself or
in a sandwich.

Casserole: Turkey noodle casserole
makes an easy one—dish dinner. The ver; ‘
sion I enjoy is hardly the product of exact
science — you can alter the proportions
based on how many people you’re cooking
for or simply the size of the dishes available
to you. Generally speaking, a medium-
sized box of boiled pasta and one beaten
egg suffice for the main components. For“
the Thanksgiving twist, shred turkey pieces
and mix them in — you can also add peas or

' other vegetables. Bake the ingredients for

30 to 40 minutes at 350 degrees. Sprinkle
in grated cheese if you’re so inclined.
Quesadillas: Turkey quesadillas are,

another lunch option. Butter or apply
cooking spray to a nonstick pan. Arrange
your ingredients on one side of a tortilla,

then fold it in half. Cook each side until

golden brown or until the cheese starts to
melt. The protein from the turkey makes

the cheesy concoction slightly more nutril‘ ‘

you don’t have quite enough left."

Stir-fry: Turkey isn’t a protein option
frequently offered at Market Central’s 360
stir—fry grill, but that’s no reason not to try
it. The leaner poultry is a health-conscious
choice over chicken or beef. Teriyaki, soy
sauce or whatever else you prefer to ﬂavor
your stir-fry with will likely be a welcome
change from the rest of the Thanksgiving
menu. J

Breakfast: If you thought breakfast
was the one meal you couldn’t incorporate
turkey into, think again. Turkey omelets
anyone? _ '

Potpie: A turkey potpie makes a
hardy and surprisingly easy meal for
chilly weather. Combine bite-sized tur-
key chunks with a third of a cup of milk,

snack: stumble to the fridge, remove Tup-
perware lid from your favorite cold side
dish and apply spoon. Ta-da! The absolute

minimum of preparation is involved in ‘

this recipe — OK, it isn’t a recipe by any
stretch of the imagination, but delicious
nonetheless. It’s the ideal medicine for
the bleary-eyed and half-conscious yet
hungry individual. ' A

A word of warning: The dinner rolls
that were so ﬂaky andadelicious are now
likely hardened into lumps. There are
methods of microwaving stale breads
wrapped in damp paper towels in a last

ditch attempt to revitalize them, but my '

preference is to pitch them into the yard
for the birds and other woodland crea-
tures. _: - '

Jameson added that although Delta

one that’s usually open for interpreta-

“It’s different every time. Songs are

CD REVIEW A

‘Miles’ a valuable journey

Red Wanting Blue releases an emotive, country—influenced LP

Larissa Gula
Staff Writer

These Magniﬁcent Miles

Red Wanting ‘Blue

Fanatic Records

B+

Rocks like: Bruce Springsteen

Red Wanting Blue’s album These Mag-
niﬁcent Miles certainly doesn’t leave its
listener wanting.

The album kicks off with “Gravity,” a
song carried through by a baritone lead
singer. Over a solid beat he sings, “I would
be a spaceman for you / If it wasn’t for
gravity, we’d be gone.”

And on the note of attempting to battle
physics, the album continues. A

The other songs follow a similar musi-

cal style, keeping the chords simple and ‘

mixing the guitar and drums reasonably.
The result is some enjoyable, emotional
rock music. A

Though the band remains consistent,
the album doesn’t become monotonous.

Tracks like “Where You Wanna Go”
bring a bit of a country-sounding melody
thatvadds something heartwarming to the
mix. “The World Is Over” picks up the
pace, taking the album a step above melo-
dious and making itenergetic, with chorus
lines like, “So beat that drum / ’Til we run
out all of the air in our lungs.’f .

About halfway through, the band of-
fers a rather touching tribute, “The Air
I Breathe.” With lyrics like, “I’ve crossed
through ﬁre and the stormy seas / Living
my life like a kamikaze / Losing you would
bring me to my knees / You’re the air I
need to breathe / I rescue you / ’Cause you
rescue me,” it had the potential of being
overblown. But the players have complete
control over their composition, and the
result is music that matches these lyrics
perfectly.

Overall, this album is very well done.
With a reasonable score that never over-
powers the vocal talents and lyrics that
offer insight into touching experiences,
Red Wanting Blue succeeds in making a
cohesive, entertaining and well-balanced
album.I

Yoder worth your ‘Trouble’

Pittsburgh native Brad Yoder is a songwriting virtuoso

Larissa Gula
Staff Writer

Excellent Trouble
Brad Yoder
Reverie Records
A . '
Sounds Like: Elliott Smith, John
Prine -

Proving once again that songs can be
both poetry and involved narratives, lo-
cal songwriter Brad Yoder’s new album
Excellent Trouble brings his myriad of
lyrical talents to attention.‘

Yoder’s songs capture the simplicity,
sadness and beauty that life experiences
afford from reminiscing about friends
of school days long past, to losing some-
one, to heartbreak and falling in love.

The song “Leave Me Like This,” for
instance — written in memory of a close
friend — is almost guaranteed to bring
tears to your eyes with the chorus line,
“You didn’t have to leave / didn’t have to
leave us wondering / what we could’ve
done, if anything?”

Other songs are just plain fun.
‘ In the title track, Yoder reminisces
about a night out with a friend, using

lyrics like, “We’ll color fluorescently}

outside the lines / so when, dour-faced‘,
they ask us why we can’t stop smiling/
it’s just that it’s all so unbearably beau-

i ‘ tiful.”

Yoder’s instrumental focus remains
on his guitar and his voice — although
he’s able to incorporate keyboards and
drums when recording in the studio
— because with these two tools alone,
his songs come through clear and poi-
gnant.

Yoder’s album also features other vo-
cal talents backing him up, such as Ray‘
DeFade and Heather Kropf. b

Each artist was chosen carefully, and
each complements their song’s emo-
tional impact.

Overall, this album offers plenty of
heartfelt moments and harmonious
melodies. ’ _

The singer—songwriter has only im-
proved since his previous release, and
it will be exciting to see what else Yoder
concocts in the coming months.l

Fiﬁ wins 2 of 3

at Duals

Mike Tully grapples with Lehigh’s Stephen Dutton earlier this season. The Panthers won two of their three matches this weekend.

Mike Furlong
Staff Writer

In college, bonus points are usually a good
thing. In college wrestling, they are only, good
if they’re in your favor.

The Pitt wrestling team took home two wins
this weekend thanks to bonus points, but fell

_r in its third contest because the other teamwas
 the beneﬁciary of bonuses.

The No. 14 Panthers headed to the_]ourney—
man Northeast Duals at Hudson Valley Commu-
nity College on Saturday, where they improved
their record to 4-3 on the season by recording
victories over Penn and No. 21 Virginia and a

‘E. loss to No. 10 American.

“It was a good team effort,” head coach
Rande Stottlemyer said. " . . .- wrestled some
very good competition and the guys responded
pretty well. We were disappointed we couldn’t
pull in the win against American, but we were

,5 right there and we believe we were the better
" team.”

“All around, we didn’t do our absolute best,”

redshirt senior heavyweight Ryan Tomei said.

“We just didn’t wrestle as good as we should
have. It was good we got the two wins but I
expect more of tl1is team.”

The Panthers ‘started the day with a 16-15
victory over Penn. The Panthers were able to
come out on top in a back—and-forth match
with both teams claiming ﬁve victories. Bo-
nus points coming from redshirt sophomore
Donnie Tasser’s 13-0 major-derision victory
over Tom Timothy made the difference in the
match. ‘ . -

Saturday marked the return of All—American
Tyler Nauman from an injury. He won his ﬁrst
dual-meet match of the season with a4-2 deci-
sion over Zack Kemmerer.

“It was big to get Nauman back from his
injury,” Stottlemyer said. “He wrestled hard
after being out for a few weeks and was able to
win us a couple of bouts out there.”

Sophomore Danejohnson picked upa 4-0
victory at 149 pounds over Andrew Lenzi.

After Tasser’s major decision win at 157
pounds, the Panthers won again at 184 pounds
with freshman Max Thomusseit taking his
match 10-7. '

In the heavyweight class, Tomei walked on

the mat with the Panthers down by a score of
15-13. Tomei pulled in a dominating 8-2 decision
over Kyle Cowan to give the Panthers a 16-15
come-from-behind victory.

In the next matchup of the day, the Pan-
thers pulled in a21-15 victory over Virginia. Pitt
and Virginia split the match with ﬁve victories
each, but the two falls recordedby Nauman and
Tomei for the Panthers madethe difference.

Nauman’s fall at 141 pounds evened the
score at 6-6 after Virginia recorded victories
at 125 pounds and 133 pounds.

Afcerjohnson fell in overtime at 149 Pounds,
the Tasser brothers ——- Donnie and P.]. — re-
corded back-to-back victories at 157 pounds
and 165 pounds. P.].’s 8-5 decision at 165 pounds
over Charles Millerwas his ﬁrst dual—meet vic-
tory of his redshirt freshman season;

At 174 pounds, redshirt junior Ethan Head-
lee dropped his second match of the day to a
ranked opponent with a 5-2 loss at the hands
of Chris Henrich, who is ranked No. 2 in the
nation.

Reasons
to be
thankful

Tonyjovenitti
Assistant Sports Editor

 

Did you watch the Backyard Brawl on Friday‘?
If so, I’m sorry.

For those of you who wasted your time to
take in Pitt’s pathetic performance against
West Virginia over Thanksgiving, I’m sure
you are ﬁnding ‘it diﬂicult to be thankful for
football right now.

Not to mention the fact that the dream
of having a non-BCS conference school
make the National Championship Game of-
ﬁcially died late Friday night when Boise
State kicked away its dreams after Auburn
pulled off an incredible comeback against
Alabama.

But fear not! Tony’s Top 10 is here to
make you feel better. This week, I bring
you 10 things to be thankful for in college
football. -

l 10. Notre Dame is awful. Sure, Pitt had a
pretty dismal season — but so did the Irish.
And if there’s one thing that can cheer Pitt
fans up, it’s seeing Notre Dame lose. The Irish
lost to Tulsa. Who does that? (What’s that?
Pitt lost to Notre Dame? Well, that brings
me to No. 9). I .

9. Penn State is awfully mediocre. The
Nittany Lions ﬁnished the season 7-5, and
they will be headed to one of the better me-
diocre bowl games simply because they are
Penn State. Nonetheless, PSU didn’t even
kind of compete for the Big Ten title.

8. The Big East is a joke, so laugh. Yes,
the Big East is~awful. So instead of wallowing
in pity, just cheer up and take in the worst
conference in the history of the BCS. You’ll
have a nice chuckle.

7. Pitt isn’t going to a BCS bowl. That’s

’ right, Pitt fans. Be thankful that the Panthers

won’t be playing in a BCS bowl (barring a
crazy turn of events). If the Panthers headed
to the Fiesta Bowl to play, say, Nebraska, they
would get embarrassed. And Pitt already
got embarrassed on national television ﬁve
times this season._ 3 ' .

6. Pitt couldn’t have underachieved
more. I know, it sounds awful. But it just
might be a good thing that Pitt stunk this

2. Cam Newton is simply fun to watch.
If you forget about all the allegations sur-
rounding Auburn’s star quarterback, then
you will really enjoy watching him play." This

. kid is unbelievable. He should easily win the

Heisman — let’s just hope the allegations

that his father asked for money in exchange -

for signing with Mississippi don’t prove to
be true, or the star quarterback likely won’t
win said trophy. A » 5 — '

',  We’ll have new teams in the BCS Na-

’ tionalCha1npionship Game.lSure, it’s not

quite what we wanted, as no BCS-buster
team is likely to make the title game. Boise
State blew its chance, and TCU is probably
headed to the Rose Bowl. But it would be
refreshing to see Oregon and Auburn in the
title game. Forthe ﬁrst time since 2005,
neither Florida, Ohio State, Texas nor USC
will participate. .

And if that doesn’t cheer you up, remem-
berthat it’s basketball season, and-the Pitt
men are currently ranked No. 3 in the na-
tion. I -

Thomusseit evenedcthe score at 15-15 with a
5-1 decision over Mike Salopek. ,

With the_score all tied up,‘Tomei closed out
the second comeback victory of the day with“
a fall at the 2:04 mark of the ﬁrst period over

John Danilkowicz.

“I went out there a lot more relaxed this time
around,” Tomei said. “I try to go out every match
and win. When these matches come down to
me, I like itbecause Iknow I shouldn’t be losing
many matches.”

In the ﬁnal match of the day the Panthers
dropped a 21-19 meet to American. The match

_ was alsoan even ﬁve‘-contest split, but this

time bonus points went against the Panthers
with the Eagles pulling in a fall and a ﬁve-point
technical fall. "Q
“We gave up some bonus points we shouldn’t
have,” Tomei said. “We got ourselves intda hole

‘ and we -were able to get it towithin two, but it

just wasn’t enough. If we wrestle our best we
beat that team.” —

Thomas Williams. .

The Panthers dropped the next ﬁve matches,
which includedJohnson’s fall to American’s Gan-
bayar Sanjaa, who is ranked 14th in the country,
and aﬁve-point technical fall by Donnie Tasser
to the nation’s t'op—ranked Steve Fittery.

The Panthers attempt to mount a comeback
fell just short after four straight victories be-
tween 174 pounds and the‘ heavyweight class.

Headlee started the comeback attempt with
a fall at 1:34 in the ﬁrst period over'Phillip Bar-
reiro.

Thomusseit followed up with a 15-5 major-
decision victory over Thomas Barreiro.

Zac Thomusseitpulled in an 8-6 decision
win over Daniel Mitchell, bringing the Panthers
within ﬁve points leading into the heavyweight
bout.

“Both Thomusseit brothers did a pretty
good job for us on Saturday,” Stottlemyer said.
“They both won two matches and they wrestled
hard and looked pretty good.”

EWL, honors

At heavyweight, Tomei took down another
ranked opponent, defeating No. 3 Ryan Flores
by a score of 6-4. Despite Tomei’s win, the Pan-
thers came up just short against the Eagles.

“If I had to pick an outstanding guy from the
weekend it’s got to be Tomei,” Stottlemyer said.
“Tomei won all three of his matches and beat
another top—ranked guy and looked impressive
during the bou .” I

The Eastern Wrestling League agreed with
Stottlemyer. Tomei was named the EWL Wres-
tler of the Week for his performance.

The Panthers will take to the mats again
this weekend at the Penn State Open in State
College.

“The opens are good to get into,” said Stot-
tlemyer. “The guys might get a chance to wrestle
ﬁve or six matches in a day. We’H see how it goes
because itwillbethe ﬁlthweekend in a row that
we’ve been wrestling.”
