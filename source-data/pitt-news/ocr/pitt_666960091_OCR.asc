Jonathan Hare
For The Pitt News

About 150 protesters battled the
elements downtown Monday to
demand ,, a new trial for a
Philadelphia journalist on death
row for murdering a police officer.

' Mumia Abu-Jamal supporters,
who believe the convicted killer
received an unfair trial in 1982,
protested in freezing rain and snow
in hopes of winning him a new trial.

Abu-Jamal was convicted of
killing Philadelphia police officer
David Faulkner in 1981 and has
been on Pennsylvania's death row
since 1982.

Since

lawyers have argued that new evi-

Lawyers also said Judge Albert
Sabo, who presided over the 1982
trial, overlooked several possible
violations of Abu-Jamal’s constitu-
tional rights.

Despite the lawyers’ claims, the

Pennsylvania Supreme Court
refused in October 1998 to re-open
the case. prompting many to ques-

Nicole Showalter almost forgot to
vote for herself when she was nominat-
ed for a management position within
the student government board.

The other board members voted
Monday evening to elect Showalter as
SGB president pro-tempore, which
would put her in charge when President
George Mongell is unavailable.

Only seven of the eight board
members would have voted for
Showalter if she hadn’t blushed bright-
ly and belatedly thrust her hand in the
air

lshowalter and her fellow SCB

members made their way through the.

first public meeting of their one-year
tenure Monday night. The meeting con-

sisted mostly of mundane housekeep-
ing chores such as position appoint-
ments. and aside from an occasional
stumble and low turnout, it proceeded
smoothly.

“There were a couple rough edges,
a couple rough nerves,” Mongell said
afterward, commenting that he and his
fellow SGB members were still adjust-
ing to speaking at their public meetings.

The biggest problem, Mongell said,
was that no students attended.

“There was absolutely inadequate
student representation here,” he said,
attributing the problem to the Martin
Luther King Day holiday and the
William Pitt Union's restricted holiday
hours.

Mongell said he took personal
responsibilityfor student attendance at
board meetings, and that in the interest

of fostering communication between
students and the SGB, he would take
whatever steps necessary to increase
turnout. ‘

The new board members offered ‘

lengthy lists of goals for the year, as
well as the steps they have taken thus

— far to address them.

Dave Lander is working with the
calendar committee on a tentative plan
to schedule a fall break. He said that if
a fall break were to be scheduled it
would encompass one or two days
sometime in October, basically a three-
or four-day weekend.

Board member Safula ‘Le,wis has
focused in part on proposals for bring-
ing a wider spectrum of entertainment

The Sutherland Express cruises in from lower campus for another load of
students. The shuttle is running behind schedule because University Drive
(shown in the background) is closed for Pennsylvania Hall demolition.

Students aren't slowed
down. by rerouted shuttle

Arlane J. Ackley

For The Pitt News_

The Sutherland Express shuttle
is so named for being quick, and
despite a five-minute delay caused
by the Pennsylvania Hall demoli-
tion, most students say it is still
quick enough for them.

For safety purposes, University
Drive, where the building is located,
has been temporarily closed until
the project is completed. The
University plans to construct an
underground parking garage with
tennis courts on top.

Pitt created a detour inithe
Sutherland Express shuttle's normal
route to avoid the street.

A few students who frequently
ride the Sutherland Express shuttle
said the change of route bothered
them, but most students said it has
not changed their daily plans in any
dramatic way.

Tai Saundersrides the shuttle
every day and said the, delay isn't
enough to affect student life.

“It's not a big deal to me, I get
there about the same time. As long
as I'm on time that's all the matters
to me,” said Saunders.

Pitt student Kevin Bilous agreed
that the delay isn't big- enough to
make a difference.

“I noticed the change. Before,
[the shuttle] went a different way."
Bilous said. “It only takes maybe
five to six minutes longer."

But Sutherland resident Katrina
Shibata said that because the shuttle
no longer stops at the Chevron
Science Center, she has a hard time
getting to a class she has there.

“It's actually a pain in the ass
now, because you have to leave ear-
lier to catch it, wait longer at the
stops, and since it is really crowded

_ you have to stand while you are rid-

ing it.” she said.

Jerry -Kvortek. Pitt's transporta-
tion manager, said the shuttle used
to go up University Drive to
Sutherland Hall. but it now takes
‘Centre Avenue to Allequippa Street.
past the Veteran’s Affairs Medical
Center and down Sutherland Drive
to lower campus. _

Although the. shuttle takes a
detour throjugh North Oakland, it
isn't -‘.‘missing’.jany stops and [is]
still going "to Sutherland Hall."
Kvortek said, » _

The construction on University
Drive hasibeen postponed because
of recent snow, sleet and ice.
Kvortek said he hopes for comple-
tionpby. the’ end of this month, but
there are no guaranteesby the looks
of‘ the weather. . '

Pennsylvania Hall, known for IIS
large .‘‘Hail to“ Pitt”.._ banner over-
looking Pitt Stadium‘, was built In
1910 and is one of the oldest build-
ings on campus. The University has
determined it is too decrepit to ren-
ovate, so it is tearing down the
building. 5

UMPC testing pig cells to help sustain patients awaiting liver transplants

Treating l5 patients suffering from liver failure using unconventional procedure

Maura Molltor
For me Pm News

The University of Pittsburgh
Medical Center is experimenting
with the liver cells of pigs in hopes
of sustaining people waiting for
liver transplants.

Researchers will study this
“bio-artificial liver assist system,"
designed by Minnesota-based
Bxcorp Medical. on 15 patients with
encephalopathy, or liver failure,
brought on by advanced liver dis-
ease.

Because the liver is unable to

  
   

G

 

function properlyin these patients,
toxins normally removed by the
liver circulate in the bloodstream
and to the brain. In its severest
form, patients become unresponsive
or comatose.

“The liver device can help to
bridge patients either to the point
where you can transplant the patient
or where the liver improves and
resumes normal function," said Dr.
George Mazariegos, assistant pro-
fessor of surgery at the Thomas E.

'Starzl Transplantation Institute and

co-principal investigator of the
study.

The primary goal of the two-
year trial, the first 01 a three-phase
study, is to ensure the safety of the
device. Once doctors determine the
device to be safe, the researchers
will try to secure approval for phas-
es two and three, in which they
determine its effectiveness.

-During phase one, patients will
be treated for one or two 12-hour
episodes with a filter made of pig
liver cells. The bio-filter is connect-
ed to the patient's vein and remains
outside the body.

_The patient’s blood circulates
these liver cells, which remove tox-

  
 

   

 

‘ .

ins from the patient's blood until a

new organ is available.

Doctors found that the one
patient already treated with the sys-
tem experienced no negative
effects, said Dr. David J. Kramer,
associate professor of anesthesiolo-
gy, critical care medicine, medicine
and surgery, and co-principal inves-

. tigator of the study.

Some of the patient’s symptoms
did improve. She no longer required
mechanical ventilation and she
showed neurological improvement.
However, she died after developing
a bacterial infection in her blood-
stream, which doctors had trouble
treating.

“It’s a common way for patients

* who have very bad livers to die,"

said Kramer. Doctors determined
that neither the catheter nor the new
liver system caused the infection.
“There has recently been a
report of a pig retrovirus infecting
human cells in the laboratory,“ said
Mazariegos. “However, there hasn't

‘ been. any clinical documentation of

this virus
patients.”

The study is subject to many
Food and Drug Administration pre-
cautions in terms of monitoring for
such a virus. One major concern is
that the filter is thought to be too
small for the virus to pass through,
said Mazariegos. Patients’ blood is
also screened.

“We are actively searching for
these viruses,,but I don't think we’ll

A team of Pitt researchers was
recently awarded a federal grant of
$5.8 million to study new HIV
treatment methods.

‘The team, led by Dr. Charles
Rinaldo Jr. at the Graduate School
of Public Health, will develop and

cells, which activate T-cells against
invading pathogens. .

Senior Staff Writer

Pitt students received a few extra
hours of sleep Friday moming.

For the first time in three years, the
University decided to cancel classes
during the morning hours. _

Although a large portion of stu-
dents were aware of the cancellation,
those who were not ventured outdoors
into the snow and ice only to arrive at
empty classrooms.

Pitt spokesman Ken Service said
Chancellor Mark Nordenberg does not
make the decision of whether to cancel
classes until early in the morning, usu-
ally around 6 a.m. Nordenberg receives
infonnation concerning weather condi-
tions from the campus police and the
Facilities Management Office.

Students wondering whether class-

es are cancelled can listen to five differ- '

ent radio stations: KDKA (1020 AM),
WBZZ (94.5 FM), WDSY (108 FM).
WZPT (100.7 FM) and KQV (1410
AM).

University cancellations will also
be. posted on local television stations 2,
4 and 11.

Service said in his four and a half
years of working at Pitt, classes were
only cancelled one other time, and the
University has never completely closed.

But Joe Fink, Pitt's director of
administration facilities, recalled the
University closing one time when the
Pennsylvania Turnpike was closed and
the governor made the decision to close
state facilities. He doesn’t recall what
year that was.

manipulate the cells to turn against
HIV and increase T-cell immunity
to the virus.

Although scientists have been
able to effectively slow the progress
of HIV by using a three-drug cock-
tail, the treatment cannot fully erad-
icate the virus. The immune sys-
tems of infected individuals can
hold off the disease for only so long
before they become susceptible to
minor infections that lead to the
development of full-blown AIDS.

The GSPH research team hopes

 

 
   
 

that using dendritic cells in con-
junction with the triple drug therapy

will help cure the disease in infect- ~

ed individuals.
Dendritic cells, which are a spe-
cific type of white blood cell, help

to coordinate the immune system’s ‘

response to foreign invaders.

The cells work by ingesting
invading bacteria or viruses, such
as HIV. They then travel to .the
lymph nodes where T-cells are man-
ufactured and present the antigens,
which are like molecular tags spe-

cific for each type of pathogen. to
the T-cells.

The activated T-cells trigger an
immune system response, which
includes the identification and
destruction of pathogens bearing
the antigen originally presented by
the dendritic cell to the T-cell.

In additio;: to Rinaldo, the team
also includes Simon Barratt-Boyes.

Students who want to learn about
a foreign culture need toexperience
it firsthand, according to a Pitt pro-
fessor.

To accommodate that need, the 4

-professor. Aaron Sheon, started a

study-abroad program in which he
will lead students through Paris.
“It's a wonderful old culture," he
said of France. “You can see how
beautiful the city looks and walk
around and observe like an anthro-
pologist. That’s what travel is all

Students will spend two weeks in
Paris, from July 4 to July 17, study-
ing French art and architecture. The
course offers three credits for the
two-week study of major museums
and monuments and the Roman,
medieval, Renaissance and modern
history of the city. Students will
study a variety of art and architecture
in Paris ‘and will also take bus excur-
sions outside the city.

Sheon likened the course to an
internship. Students will be required
to keep a diary or journal. and they
will be encouraged to speak in
French. Some knowledge of the lan-
guage is helpful but not required.

“The language is easy to pick
up,” Sheon said. He recommended
that students without much knowl-
edge of French buy language-educa-
tion tapes to get started.

It is also possible to earn an extra
credit by doing special research on a
language- or art-related topic and
completing a required paper in
French.

Sheon said he suggested this
program to attract students to France,
where they can see a foreign culture
firsthand.

“It's different, and that's what’s
nice about it,” he said. “It's a nice

meals per. week, cultural activities
and required field trips in the Paris
region. Students will also have to pay
for their air fare and the rest of their
meals.

Sheon said the costsin Paris
aren't too high as long as students
avoid eating at luxurious restaurants.
He added that this is a excellent time
to go to Paris, since the dollar is
strong there now. He said he will
help students find modest restau-
rants, cafeterias and sidewalk cafes.

— Students may use all state and
federal financial aid and most Pitt
scholarships to finance the trip.

Sheon added that students have
an option to go to Paris early or stay
after to travel around Europe.

“It's an opportunity to work for
the rest of the summer, or you could
go to London for the weekend. With
a Eurail pass, you can travel inexpen-
sively.” he said.

The Pitt Study in Paris program
is an extension of the already exist-
ing program in Nantes. France.
which is_ under the direction of
Professor Phil Watts. Interested stu-
dents can attend both programs if
they wish. _ ,

Interested students should pick
up applications and. return them to
the Study Abroad office, and students
will be required toattend at least
three ‘orientation sessions on Pitt's
campus. Information sessions are
also available for interested students.
the firstof which is on Tuesday in
802 WPU from 4 to 5 p.m.

THE Prr1- News

Students can earn frequent-

flier miles by volunteering time

Denlse Jewell

The Dally Free Press

BOSTON (U-WIRE) — Flying
home for the holidays or away for spring
break can be expensive, but students
don’t have to be taken for a ride.

United Airlines is now offering stu-
dents a unique way to earn free ﬂights
without spending any money.

The program, called College Plus
VolunteerMiles, allows students who
volunteer for one of six organizations to
earn 5,000 frequent-ﬂier miles for every
50 hours of volunteer time.

Among the volunteer groups in the-

program are Habitat for Humanity,
Special Olympics and the Make-A-Wish
Foundation.

The program offers other discounts
to students as well, even if they don't
volunteer. Members of the charities
receive 15 percent off published fares, as
well as other discounts, and even get a
bonus when they graduate, according to a
written statement from the airline.

Even without special student deals,
frequent-ﬂier discounts can offer a good
deal. But passengers should be aware
that rules vary among airlines, said Ben
Schers of Heller Travel in Boston.

According to Schers, passengers
must ﬂy about 40,000 to 60,000 miles to
earn a ticket on most airlines. That could
mean having to ﬂy more than 30 ﬂights
before earning a free ticket. V

But some airlines offer flights for
fewer miles, and each airline has its own
rules when it comes to the ways miles
can be earned.

Bonus miles programs are another
bargain available to passengers. Airlines
will offer extra points during winter,
when fewer people ﬂy, Schers said.

Delta Airlines, United Airlines and
US Airways also offer bonus points for
booking ﬂights online.

But neither Northwest Airlines nor
Continental Airlines will credit miles for
discount tickets, Schers said. Many air-
lines’ miles have expiration dates.
Blackout periods when passengers can-
not use their miles to claim tickets are
also common, especially during tl1e’holi-
days.

“The usual blackout periods are the
obvious times Christmas,
Thanksgiving,” Schers said. “It all
depends on the carrier. It also depends on
what status you have within your miles
program.”

Both American Airlines and
Continental have changed their programs
in the last year to reduce blackout peri-
ods. American Airlines now has only
seven days per year when passengers
can’t claim miles, and Continental has no
blackout days for their EasyPass mem-
bers. ‘ ‘ .

“It really depends on/where you're

going,” Schers said. “They all reward
you for your loyalty.”

Alliances between airlines can help
get _ cheaper ﬂights and earn more
mileage because passengers can look for
the cheapest ﬂight between the two air-
lines, Schers said.

Northwest and Continental formed
an alliance in December. US Airways
and American Airlines joined together in
August to allow members to enjoy bene-
ﬁts on both airlines.

But in most cases, in order to earn
miles, passengers have to ﬂy the same
airline repeatedly, which may not always
mean the best deal for the ﬂight.

MUMIA  .  

approximately 1:30 p.m.

As the crowd prepared to
march, violent wind and rain forced
everyone to take shelter inside the
church.

Inside a the church, several
speakers addressed the crowd. They
compared Abu-Jamal with leg-
endary black leaders such as Martin
Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X, cit-
ing Abu-Jamal‘s efforts to end
racism and injustice. '

Pitt professor Marcus Rediker,
who has followed Abu-Jamal’s
plight since it began, said he feels
the state and federal government
treated Abn-Jamal unfairly because

'. "mom ms g '

of his “willingness to speak out”
against racial injustice.

“This case shows everything
that is wrong with the death penalty
in the United States,” he said.

Once the speakers finished and
the weather improved. the crowd
marched to the Federal Building,
carrying signs and chanting, “’_l‘hey,
say death row, we say hell no.” /

There, during another 20-
minute demonstration, Redikersaid
nobody can be free until Abu-Jamal
is free.

“This is one in a long line of
events that will lead to a huge
debateyover the death penalty in the

tories,skits, etc.

Martin Luther King

Jr. Day

should be observed at Pitt

Monday the United States
observed ‘Martin Luther King
.lr.’s birthday.

But how many of us really
observed it?

Carnegie Mellon University
took halfthe-day off to remem-
ber andvcelebrate King's accom-
plishtnents.

Beginning at 12:30 p.m.,
CMU conducted service projects
to pay tribute to King. The uni-
versity also had presentations,
displays, discussions and Ice-
tures. It even held a candlelight
vigil.

At Pitt, we slept in.

Other than Black Action

./Society-’s planned presentation .

of King. and ‘fellow civil rights
leader ‘Malcolm Xv’s historic
meeting, lPitt’s campus had no
sign of observance.

lWe simply did not have
classes. King, a teacher of equal-

ity and unity, would cringe to

see the day not used for educa-
tion. ’ ' a
Martin Luther King‘ Jr. Day
should not be simply a one-day
break; ;it- ‘should _be a day’ of
reme‘m_bering_ a3 great man who‘
struggled’ -to a ‘bring, a nation

together. It should be a day dur-
ing which we acknowledge the
work King completed and the
work yet unfulfilled.

The Pitt News feels it is the
Pitt community’s duty to use the
day as one of learning and inspi-
ration. to reach within ourselves
and_ attempt to grasp the mean-
ing of what King stands for.

We would like to see a
Martin Luther King Jr. Day dur-
ing which‘ the William Pitt
Union is ﬂooded with people
going to discussions and lectures
about civil rights and about
King's life and the effect of his
actions.

We'd like to see posters cam-»
pus-wide bearing King.’s picture. '

We'd like ‘Pitt TV and
WPTS-FM to run King's “I Have
a Dream” speech.

We'd like all student groups
to get involved,‘ not just BAS.
The day is not only about black
people, but about humanity.
King won't go down in history

. as being a great black man, ‘but a
- great man. ‘
We'd like Martin Luther_

King Jr. Day to mean something

‘to Pitt.

Don't believe everything you read

Ron Ridenhour, a journalist who passed‘

away last year, had some very straightforward
advice to give his fellow citizens. “What you
have to understand about the govemment,”
Ridenhour said, “is that the motherfuckers lie.”

‘ The advice seems simple enough, and
most Americans would probably argue that
such askeptical view consists of little more

 common sense. In reality, however.

Ridenhour's advice is rarely followed, least of
all by members of the mainstream media
whose task it ought to be to expose oﬁicial
mendacity. Most people (but most especially
members of the press who subsist on a daily
diet of ofﬁcial statements and press confer-
ences) commit the error of giving the beneﬁt of
the doubt to official pronouncements. One can

.never do this, especiallyvwhen the agency in
Nqtrestion stands to beneﬁt ﬁom a lie.

Even in cases in which a lie is so obvious
that even the mainstream media eventually
catch on, the official story often enjoys the hen-
eﬁt of the doubt during" a crucial period; later
revelations of the truth are then dismissed as
“old news” or otherwise irrelevant.

Who now remembers Sudan
and Afghanistan, even a scant ﬁve
months ‘after President Clinton-’s
adventure in those places? After

 

ignoring the key issue —— namely. that the

United States claims to have acted in “self-

‘ defense” lacked even a laughable pretense of
’credibility.- The New York Times and its ilk at

last conceded that the administration had been
spouting outright fabrications about the
Sudanese factory bombed by the United States.
Knowledgeable observers pointed out that peo-
ple had been able ‘to come and go freely in the

vicinity of the pharmaceutical facility in ques-

tion, hardly a halhnark of a top-secret chemical
weapons factory. And while traces of a chemi-
cal necessary to the production of VX nerve gas
were found in the hollowed-out shell of the

_ building, it was conceded that the chemical is

aJoHN-,
LACNY

°°“""'”'5T allows the United States to change

mention media — had even a modicum of civic
self-respect would look upon such an event as
a source of shame and outrage. In the United
States, the most we can get is another rehashing
of that old passive-voice cop-out, “mistakes
were made."

Needless to say, the attack was not so
inconsequential for the Sudanese. One man
died in the actual bombing, and the further con-
sequences of destroying one of the few sources
of medicines in a squalidly impoverished
region of the world cannot be fully calculated.
In an important sidelight, the demolished facto-
ry had been the only medicine producer in
Sudan with an export license for Iraq. Thus the
United States ensured that even fewer medi-
cines would reach a country that was already
being crushed under murderous sanctions. Yet
we are to believe the assurances of the president
that “we have no quarrel with the Iraqi people,”
even though bombs were pumrneling Baghdad
last month, occasionally exacting regrettable
“collateral damage.”

The preponderant lack of even short-term
_ historical memory in the United
. - States — exempliﬁed by the absence
of any concern over oﬁicial duplici-

Carrie Hager
columnlat

Our country has deﬁnitely hit an
all-time low, at least as far as morality
is concerned.

I thought Clinton making a joke
out of the presidency was bad enough,
but when the founder of Hustler maga-
zine has .a chance to affect one of the
biggest events of the century, you know
things have hit bottom.

For a while, the impeachment
p'r~':ess seemed to be going well. The
Republicans were willing to ﬁght hard
to do whatis right: convict Clinton.
But then Hustler publisher Larry Flynt
comes along, and the Republicans’ start

' to wimp out, afraid that secrets from 9

their past might be revealed.
The trouble started in October,

when Flynt purchased an ad in the‘

Washington Post. He offered uplto $1
million for anyone with “evidence of

illicit sexual relations with a congress- .

man, senator or member of the execu-
tiveor judiciary branch.”

THE PI1-r NE:ws:- OPINIONS

Flynt: pornographer by clay, blackmaier by night

First of all, he is a very sick man
whose life was glossed over in the
movie “The People vs. Larry Flynt,”
which showed how Flynt wanted free-
dom of'the press.

I don’t think pornography is what
our founding fathers had in mind when
that amendment was written. You have
to wonder about someone whose busi-
ness is pornography.

I would propose either ignoring
Flynt or ﬁnding a way to prosecute him
for blackmail, which really is what he
is doing. Blackmail is illegal, and I
can’t ﬁgure out why no one seems to
care about that. What he is doing is
scaring the Republicans into not push-
ing toward conviction by threatening to
reveal damaging information.

Instead of cowering and conceding
to Flynt, the Republicans should work
toward his being prosecuted for black-
mail. They've become wimps. A man
like Flynt gets his power through fear.
He is nothing, and he would lose the
power he is holding over them if they
would stop being afraid.

 

If they stand up to him, chances are
he will reveal some damaging informa-
tion, but they should just ignore it. Life
goes on and will continue to go on even
if embarrassing infomiation if made
public.

I do think it is wrong that some
Republicans had extra-marital affairs,
but I don't think affairs are the real
issues people should be worried about.
People should be more concerned that
our President broke the law and that
Flynt is breaking the law.

Flynt is just a sleazeball trying to
do an underhanded sleazy thing, which
really comes as no surprise. You have
to remember who you are dealing with
here.

I also find it interesting that he only
seems interested in -revealing informa-
tion about, Republicans. I'm sure the
Republicans aren’t the only ones with
secrets to hide. Flynt just wants to stop
the impeachment process, and this is
the only way he thinks he can do it.
And he definitely has had an effect
already. Speaker-elect Bob Livingston

resigned when Flynt‘s investigation
revealed an affair Livingston had. .

According to a recent Newsweek
article, ‘Flynt received thousands of
calls and investigated about four
dozen. He found Clinton sympathizers
to help investigate and.is threatening to
reveal more information this week.
There is nothing good that could,possi-
bly come out of what Flynt is doing.
Either way he will cause damage.

If the Republicans continue to
wimp out, and Clinton is not convicted
because of it. damage will have been
done. .

And what about the children? It's
bad enough. to explain what went on
with Clinton and Lewinsky — how do
you explain who Larry Flynt is, what
pornography is and what he is doing?

It is truly a sad time for our coun-

try, and it is only getting worse because ~

of Flynt. In my mind, people like him
don’t even deserve to be in society.
Carrie Hager thinks Larry F lynt is
a swell guy. "Swell" in the sleazy, dis-
gusting sense of the word. -

After a particularly trying week
during which nearly’ every female I
know complained to me about their
problems with guys, I decided I should
write a guidebook.

I was forwarded an e-mail recently
that listed the ways to please a woman.
There were about 100 things —— compli-

ments, caresses, ﬂattery, things like

that. Then, _under “how to please a
mam” the list said something to the
effect of “show up." Unfortunately, this
is atleastpartly trueandalot ofguys
don't realize it. ' ‘

Particularly incollege (at the peak ‘

of hormonal activity for the young
male), women are quite difficult. All the
guy wants is for the woman to answer
“yes” to a variety of questions; “Yes,
I'll go out with you,"-“Yes, I won't
mind. if we just  beer and ._watch
football,” “Yes, I'think getting-. drunk

and being taken advantage of is fun,”«

“Yes',.'I think it's funny when you belch

This is confusing and frustrating for the
average college male. Why can’t we
sex? Why isn't it
courting/foreplay when I take you to the
monster truck rally — doesn't that

Why does everything have to mean
something? Would it help if I read you
this poem (that someone else wrote)?

College boys generally fall into a
few major categories:

Frat boys (30 percent) - Not far
above primates. All frat boys will at
some point get dangerously intoxicated
and act like assholes. Most of them do
it frequently.

“Nice” boys (40 percent)-- There
are a lot of men out there who are
“nice." They are the ones who actually
worry about how to make women think
they are affectionate, intelligent and
supportive. They compare notes. They

learn lines. They are smooth. But often.

    A iaclediwomcm’s view of men

They are insecure, brainy or goofy-
looking. They fear they are doomed to

failure with women. so they go out of .
their way to understand what women

want. Often this type of guy gets stuck
in the position of having a lot of female

friends but no romantic involvements.

Fear prevents them from pushing rela-
tionships to the next level, so they just
stagnate and fester, learning what
makes girls tick without doing anything

' about it.

“Sensitive artist” type boys (10
percent) - They are egotistical, selﬁsh,
narcissistic and often fascinating. These
men are very frustrating for most girls,
for reasons ‘I hope are obvious.

Signiﬁcantly older guys (10 per-
cent) - There are usually a fair number
of men on a college campus who are in
their 30s or older. Two words: midlife
crisis. ‘

And then there are gay guys. They
are not counted above because they are
off the market, or playing for a different

team, whatever euphemism you prefer. -

They're usually great to hang out with.

However, beware the gay guywho isn't

sure or hasn't realized he is gay yet =-
heartbreak city for any girl who gets
involved.

 

A frustrating aspect of all of this is
that there. are guys out there who really

-think they want to have-meaningful

relationships. They want to ' learn to
communicate and to make girlsghappy.
But at this stage in their lives, their hor-
mones make everything so much more
urgent. .

Thus, they overreact or- make
embarrassing mistakes. Typical males
react to their own bad behavior poorly:

‘They either deny they were wrong, get

disproportionately frustrated or get
angry with whomever was involved.
Sometimes patience helps, sometimes
not. The male who is in control of his

« own body, not a slave to honnones. is a

good (and rare) find.
I admit this sounds kind of grim.
There are real honest-to-goodness nice
guys out there. There are guys out there
who don't want just sex. But after a lot
of my experiences with the opposite
sex,,and after dealing with all _of my
female friends who have been 
mentally abused, discriminated against
and harassed, I’ve tended to get a bit

The NCAA
strikes again
with stupidity
'I1Einseal~Iic'3:%tai§ often criticized.

and rightly so, for treating student-
athletes unfairly — for example, by

‘not allowing them to hold part-time

jobs (even in the off-season) like
other students. The holders of this
point of view usually argue that the
NCAA is a money-grubbing para-

. site, leeching off the talents of stu-

dent-athletes. .

H That 'image is justified.
Sometimes its rules are so bizarre
that one has to wonder if the NCAA
is smart enough to intentionally
leech off anybody. Consider the

_case of Drew Henson.

Drew Henson is a backup quar-

'terback for the University of

Michigan football team. He is also
a professional baseball player-in
the New York Yankees’ farm sys-
tem, and so Drew Henson baseball
cards recently started appearing.
The Drew Henson rookie card from
Upper Deck was on the market for
two weeks, selling for up to 5
measly dollars. “Was" is the key
word in that sentence.

Since Henson is still eligible to
play football at Michigan, he’s still
subject to the imaginative regula-
tions of the bumbling NCAA. The
production of the baseball card is
against those regulations.

The NCAA?‘ allows "Henson to
play professional _ baseball,’ while
remaining an amateur in football,
which is absurd even by the
NCAA’s standards. At least it’s an
absurdity that benefits athletes, a
rare occurrence in the NCAA.

The catch is that NCAA rules
do not ‘allow companies, such as
Upper Deck, to profit from the

‘ / image of student-athletes.

Never mind that every time a

check "comes-in from a television"

network" paying for the rights to
broadcast college games, the

NCAA itself is profiting from the A
images of student-athletes. Come to

think of it, the networks proﬁt from
that transaction. too. Apparently,

the only problem the NCAA has‘

with making a profit comes when it
doesn't get a .cut. '

interest in protecting the integrity

Some might refer to the
University of - Con'necticut
men’s basketball team as but-
ter, because so far this season
it’s definitely been on a roll.

These same admirers might
also see the University of
Pittsburgh men’s team as a
popsicle, because although the
team sometimes appears to
play sweet, the results as of
late have been quite sticky.

These distinct styles of
basketball were no different on
Saturday, as the Connecticut
Huskies continued their
unbeaten streak and main-
tained their No. '1 ranking in
the nation, rolling past Pitt 81-

58 at the Hartford Civic,

Center.

UConn’s performance was V

heightened by a variety of
players, despite the fact that
Richard Hamilton, Connecticut
senior guard and the Big East’s_
leading scorer, was held to a

season-low five points on just
two of eight shooting.

The Huskies (l5-0, 7-0)
were led by Albert
Mourning’s 18 points, _seven
of which came on a 13-0 run
in the first half, allowing
UConn to extend its lead to
19-6. This run kept the
Panthers (9-7, 1-5) trailing
the entire game and forced
the majority of Coach Ralph
Willard’s squad into constant
foul trouble.

The Huskies were 21 for
35 from the foul line, while
the Panthers connected on
just four of six free throw
attempts.

Another reason for the

‘ Panther’s slow start, besides

the quick and ﬂuid tempo of
the l-luskies, was their unfor-

tunate travel situation. Pitt’s

Pitt's men’s and women‘s swim-
ming and diving teams both defeated
the Mountaineers of West Virginia
Saturday. _

The women brought their season
record above .500 to 5-4, while the
men are knocking on the door of _a
.500 record at 3-4. .

The women’s team took top hon-
ors in 11 events at the meet, including
Jamie Tomazich’s diving wins on the
1- and 3-meter boards. ‘ .

“We have been very fortunate to
be able to count on her [’I‘omazich] to i
win every meet,” coach Marian
Cassidy Keen said of her stardiver.

Tomazich has taken both diving
events in each dual meet so far this
season.

“It is never a given, but unlike
many other talented divers. she is
dependal_>le," Cassidy Keen said.

-Tomazich’s’ performance was
complemented by a strong showing
from the Lady Panther swimmers,
with Amanda Lyle, Megan Zerhusen
and Smantha_Chabotar each winning
an event.’ , _ v '

In only its second relay win of this
young season, Pitt took the 400-yard
medley with the team of Beth Grube,
Megan Kosinski, Liz Perry and

Zerhusen. These four women finished
with a time of 3 minutes, 57 seconds.
“Everyone is starting to come
around. and that always helps the
relay teams,” Cassidy Keen said.
Also taking firsts for the Lady
Panthers were Perry (200 individual

medley). Jennifer Slack (200 butter-

fly). Karen Thibodeau (200 back-'
stroke) and Kosinski (200 breast-
stroke). .

' The women’s team has bee
anchored by seniors, including
Tomazich and Chabotar.

“It is agood tradition we have ‘

started here. Every year, the seniors
step up and take it to another level.”
Cassidy Keen said.

The men's team returned to action
for its first meet since before the win-
ter break and coach ‘Chuck Knoles
worried that‘ his swimmers would be
“rusty.”

He said he told them before the
meet to go out and swim like it was
the toughest meet of the year, hoping
they would shake off some of the rust.

His swimmers responded well,
taking both first and second in every A
event _at thedual meet and adding
third place in most. '

After the meet, Knoles decided to
make some of the events exhibitions

Track comes away from Kent

   

 

‘Erie Whlteman
contributing Editor

It was too slippery to even walk
quickly anywhere between Pittsburgh
and Kent, Ohio, but in an oasis, for
track and field. Pitt athletes traded
studded snow tires for spiked shoes
andcompeted indoors.

Fortunately for Pitt track coach
Steve Lewis, his runners knew they
were competing against the clock,
and not the elements or other teams
on the oversized Kent State indoor
track. -

Most indoontrack meets are not
scored as a team, but are just run for
individualscores. The goal is to qual-
ify as many athletes for the East
Coast Athletic Conference and Inter-
Collegiate Association of Amateur
Athletes of America championships.

Four meets into the season. eight
men and 10 women, in addition to a
pair of relay teamsvfor each squad.

— have already qualified. ' »

“It's a big» achievement at this
time of the year," Lewis said. “Now
the athletes‘ can have fun and
improve."

Leading the surge of qualiﬁers
was Ayana Coleman. in addition to
the five events that make up the pen-
tathalon. Coleman set a school record
in the indoor 300 meter hurdles and
ran a leg on the winning mile relay.

“I'm getting used to it, it's. like
theheptathalon. The whole team does
doubles and triples," she said. refer-

Siatiewiih individual wins  

ring to when an athlete competes in
two or three events in one meet.

When you consider that the pen-
tathalon counts as one event, a triple
could consist of seven races, as it did
forcoleman.

Coleman is not alone. - The
women’s team has now qualified five
women to compete ,in the pen-
tathalon. She joins Nicole Kelly,
Dana McKoy, Trecia Smith and Tia
Tabb.

“This helps the team, no, other

' team has girls who can compete in so

many events, Pitt is known for the
pentathalon.” Coleman said.

' While some athletes looked to
qualify, others sought to improve or
just get in some race time.

For Trecia Smith, NCAA record-
holder in the triple jump, qualifying
now for the pentathalon allows her to
concentrate on the long and triple
jumps for the rest of the season.

“I cameout to qualify (for the
pentathalon) and get in a good shot
put, which I did," Smith said.

Her put of 14.29 meters was a
personal best for the season.

Sekou Dilday, who won the
men’s 400 in school record time of
47.59 seconds, easily qualifying for
the IC4As, is trying to qualify for the
next level. the NCAA
Championships.

NCAA possibly have in telling
Upper Deck who can and cannot
appear on baseball cards, particu-
larly when the person in question is
a professional baseball player?

The answer is the same business

the NCAA has in telling newspa- . 5*

pers they cannot carry advertise-
ments for gambling agencies if they
wish to receive media credentials

'_ for college athletics contests (yes,
, that has happened). Or the same
_ business the NCAA has in telling

any private corporation what it can

‘ A ness at all. ‘

Unfortunately, the NCAA
excels in sticking its nose where it
doesn't belong. On top of that, it

. often smacks of hypocrisy.

Many of the same newspapers

A to which the NCAA tried to deny

media credentials carry not only
some shady‘ advertisements, but
also columnists‘ predictions and
even point spreads for college foot-

ball and basketball games, about

which the NCAA did nothing.
Why? Because it has no right to do
anything. just as it has no right to
do anything about the ads.

_ Fortunately for Drew Henson,

the Panthers to land in New York's
LaGuardia Airport early Friday
evening and then take a two-and-a-
half hour bus ride to Hartford.

“It didn’t help, but we can’t use
that as an excuse,” said Willard.
“That's part of winter."

Regardless of_ the late arrival,
team members felt they were ready to

The Panthers were led by junior
forward Isaac Hawkins. who ﬁnished

the game with a team-high 14 points

and nine rebounds.

“It’s hard doing that, but we can't
blame losing on that," said Hawkins,
whose first-half jump shot out the

    

    

Huskies’ lead to 12 with 2:20 to play
and marked the closest Pitt would
come all game.

“I think we got enough sleep," he
said.

What a difference 35 days have
been for the Pitt men’s team.

After nearly shocking the top-
rated Huskies at the Fitzgerald
Fieldhouse Dec. 12, the NCAA
Tournament-destined Panthers now
find themselves in a frustrating situa-
tion. -
This past Saturday, the red-hot
Huskies welcomed the travel-weary
Panthers into their gym and properly
dismissed any possible chance of
another Panther upset. UConn has
been victorious in all seven games
since its encounter with Pitt. the clos-

est game ending with the team win-
ning by l3 points. In all the games.
the Huskies have won by at least a
margin of 23.

“They have so many guys." said
sophomore forward Ricardo Greer.
“That whole team is balanced.”

Contributing in the Huskies’ rout
was Khalid El-Amin, with 17 points,
and Jake Voskul and Edmund
Saunders, who finished with 14
apiece. Voskul also grabbed 12
boards.

UConn mesmerized Pitt with its
abundance of talent and its excellent
use of team chemistry. This same
form of chemistry is something Pitt
thought it found just over a month ago

‘ in Puerto Rico, and for 39 minutes

and 51 seconds against UConn in

their first meeting.

With the absence of team leader
Kellii Taylor, who has missed the last
five Panther games. the team is
searching for the ingredients that cre-
ated the excitement and grace of the
early part of the season.

“I think (the ranking) hurt us a lit- '

tle bit.” said Hawkins. “We kind of
shied away from what we did before,
got the big heads, and we never got
that back."

Attila Cosby chipped in with 12
points for Pitt, while Greer and
Vonteego Cummings scored 10 each.

The Panthers resume to action
tonight at Villanova (13-5, 4-4), as
they continue to battle their way back
into contention in the competitive Big
