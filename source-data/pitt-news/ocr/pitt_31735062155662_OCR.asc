Survey Shows
College WVomen

HoldDual ear .

According t.o a survey made by
a graduate psychology student,
Robert D. Wickham, the asso--
ciated ‘problems of courtship‘ and
marriage‘ lead to more anxiety
among today’s college women
than any other cause. Highest
amongferarsvin the students in-
terviewed was the fear of “ag-
gressive dates.f’ <_17%'.ol’ the wom-
en feared that they would never
be able to ﬁnd their"‘mate,” while
40% had fears of becoming old
maids.

By way of explanation, Mr.
Wickham said that the great con-
cern evidenced by the women
about the general problems rela-
tive to sex was due, in ‘part, to
their deeply religious back-
grounds, as well/as their ignorance
on the subject. A ,

Other fears included: not be-
ingable to have children, and the
fear of childbirth.

Relative to other subjects, Mr.
Wickham found that‘ the woman
of 1953 fears ‘communism’ and

polio above all other factors.

    Flora Book

‘Published
By Pitt Men

By CATHERINE VVILSON

The combined talents of two
former University of Pitts-
burgh professors, fostered by
three Pittsburgh institutions, have
resulted in a book, which, even
before publication, has received
"high praise from artists and,‘
scholars in the ﬁeld. ‘

The lengthy title of this beau-
tiful, two—volume set, being pub-
lished by the University of Pitts-
burgh Press in December, is
,“Wild Flowers of Western Penn-
sylvania and, the Upper Ohio
Basin.”

It contains more than 600 pages
of scientiﬁc text by the well-
known botanist, ‘Dr. 0. E. Jen-
nings,'and 200 life-size, full color
illustrations by the late scientist
and artist, Dr. Andrey Avinoﬁ.

Buhl Grant’ Responsible

A grant from The Buhl Founda-
tion made jointly to the University
of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Insti-

tute has made possible this pub— -

lication which, the publishers say,
is "their “masterpiece.” Cost of a
set is $60, an offer far below the
cost of publishing. ,

The lifework of Dr. Jennings,
director emeritus of Carnegie In-
stitute and retired head of the De-

partment of Biological Sciences,

University of Pittsburgh, is rep-
resented in the 600-page text of

‘ Vol. I, as he spent 50 years of

study in the «ﬁeld gathering,’ col-

,1ecting, identifying and labeling
, species.

Botanist Wife Helped
He_also wrote the informal de-

scriptions which face the color .

illustrations in 'Vol. II. Dr. Jen-
ning’s"wife, also a botanist, ac-
companied him on many of his
.ﬁeld trips and, he says, is to
“blame” for many of his plants.
According to Dr. Jennings,
“Wild Flowers” . . . began life as
a small manual, then Dr. Avinoff
indicated that he would illustrate
‘it, resulting in amagniﬁcent work
many years later. Now 6, Dr. Jen-

’ nings sums up his years of work as

“lots of fun.”
Scientiﬁc Study Praised

_ ‘Vol I has been praised as “prob-
ably the most comprehensive sci-
entiﬁc, study ever made of a single
botanical area.” The, Introduction
gives a natural history of the area

anclthe text presents accurate in- .

formation about 2,800 species.
Death came to Dr. Avinoff in
1949 before he saw the results of
his work. Internationally known
as an artist and scientist, Dr. Av-
inoff was director emeritus of Car-

negie Institute, and retired advis- .

ory professor of ﬁne arts and bio-
logical sciences, ' University of
Pittsburgh. '
200 Color Illustrations

He spent two years painting the
2.0.0 life-size water color illustra-
tions, using only three primary
colors. '

partment of Fine Arts, Carnegie

book, we are at once lost in the
charm of its pages, the simplicity
and poetry of the author’s style
being perfectly matched to the
fresh grace of AvinoiT’s images.”

Robert T. ‘Hatt, director of

says: “His (Avinoﬁ’s) illustrations
spring like living plants from the
printed page to make this the
handsomest of all American ﬂow-

Two grads were sitting in the

Tuck Shop the other day talking ‘

over old times and letting their
coffee get warm. As I walked
past one of them said, “Hey, kid.
What’s new around the old
place?”

The tray in

trembled and

“You m e a n

PACT?”

“Speak up,‘ l~‘;};'i,” said - grad
number one. “I thought you said

something about a ‘rally damage

pact’?” ‘
“I did say that, sir,’’ I _mur-
mured, “And please, sir, when

you say it please say it in capital ‘

letters. Student Congress would
like it to get some publicity on
it.” ‘

“Okay, Okay, kid,” said grad
number one. “I’ll say it in capi-
tals, but let us in on it, will you?”
The Pact ‘Arrives!

“Well, sir,” I said, “It all start-
ed back in October when Pitt,

PCW, Tech, and Duquesne got“

together and wrote a proclama-
tion which ‘ stated that each
schoo1’s ‘s t u d e n t government

by students from those institu-

PCW lost it’s indignation a few
weeks after it lost its collective
panties in a raid.” .
Checkbooks. Maybe?

“That’s too bad, kid,” said grad
number two, .“But that still puts
Pitt students in a good position.

Financial Responsibility?

I smiled again, but it was a
smile of pity this time. “Both of
you missed the point. This pact

Both grads nodded. ‘You might

“I know a veteran who came

Always spending it for reht, or

example, of course, but most of
the other students are on the
same level. They work all sum-
mer and then fritter their savings
on tuition and books.‘ You’re
right, kid. This might teach
them ﬁnancial responsibility.”

“There’s just one more ques-
tion,’? said grad number one.
“Why is everyone in such a rush
to get a PACT?” ‘

I had a ready answer for this

.one, but I struggled to control my-

voice.

By LYNN

wA'rsoN

The Pitt freshman gridders will attempt to chalklup the

A vzname of West Virginia in the win column of their untarnished

slate of two triumphs and no defeats tomorrow night at Wil-

merding Field.

The contest, a beneﬁt game,-will be sponsored by the
Wilmerding Optimist Club, but the Skyscraper Frosh are
expected to have little charity for the “ridgerunners” from

Morgantown. Making no predic-O~—

tions, Coach Petro’s only comment
was, “The boys are in highspirits
and are looking forward to the
game.” i ,

Although the starting lineup has
not yet been announced, either
Jim Lenhart or Cornelius Salva-
terra will pilot the Panthers’
straight-T formation against the

Mountaineers’;sp1lit-T. Lenhart, an A
3 excellent, play caller, will proba-

bly yield to the speedier Salva-

terra, the squad’s high scorer.
Torn Jenkins and Nick Passo-

delis are Petro’s nom_inees for right

. half, while “Bugs” Bagamery ap-
‘ _,parently has the left half post

sewed up. Although Ralph Cipers
did a superb job, against Kent

V State last Friday, Joe Walton will

probably get the nod to‘ ﬁll the
fullback position.

Either Bob Rosborough or Dale
Brown, both suffering hand in-
juries, will start at right end. The

.. ‘left end spot is a toss-up between

Dick Sherer or Chuck Brueckman.
Bob Pollack has eliminated all
competition from his left tackle
job, but Vince Scorxne and Her-
man Canil are still ﬁghting for the
other tackle position. »

The guard posts will be spit be-

I tween" Joe Cindrich and John Po-

gozelski on the right side and
Cindrich and Dan Wisniewski on
the left side. Frank Cicero, though
injured last week, has ﬁrmly es-
tablished himself at the center of
the forward wall.

Omegas ‘Lose

First Grid Tilt

To Lambda Chi‘

By STEVE BUTCHOCK

Lambda Chi Alpha knocked
Omega Psi Phi out of the
ranks of the undefeated by a
score of 15-2 in near-freezing
weather at the Schenley Oval
Wednesday. The Lambs took
advantage of every breakiin
edging their favored foe.

The opening minutes of the
game was marked by -an odd in-’
cident in that each side earned a

safety. The teams battled on even
terms throughout the remainder

. of the period.

The strong wind held the pass-
ing phase of the game -to a mini-
mum. Many‘ passes were blown
out of reach or dropped by “cold-
ﬁngered” receivers.

Interception Opens Gap

The. ﬁrst half looked like it
would end deadlocked at two-
all when the ﬁrst real break of
the game occurred. The Omegas,
deep in their own territory, with
less than a minute remaining,
were trying long passes in an
attempt to forge into the lead. Don
Miller suddenly intercepted a pass
and raced forty yards down the
sideline to put the Lambs ahead,
8-2.

The hard—fought third stanza
found neither team able to pene-
trate beyond_their opponents’ 20-
yard line. The Omegas, who were
repeatedly thrown for losses by
the hard-rushing Lamb lineman,
had possession of the ball on their
one-yard line and decided to kick
on third down rather than risk be-
ing thrown for a safety. The ball
sliced off the kicker’s ‘foot and out
of bounds on the 30-yard‘ line. '

Passes Fail
'I‘he‘La.mbs then took over and

scored the clincher early in the

fourth period. They used a strict
grou d attack to push to the
thre —yard line from.where Ron-

~ n-ie Chloboski ran around left end

for the score.

The, Omeg-a’s lon-g passes failed
to click in the ﬁnal few minutes
as they desperately attempted to
get back into the game.

PI'I"l"S GRID lineups for the
first six games ‘have showed
a total of twelve changes at .
the various positions, includ- '
ing‘ four different left half-
abacks.

If Mere Hunger
Decided Games . . .

By

Sports Editor

‘Red Dawson is unwilling to entertain any talk of “run-
ning up a high score” tomorr

ow against Virginia, but Pitt

rootersare hoping for such a happy event———for a number

of e_xcellent reasons.

\

The fact that we’re hungry -goes without ‘saying. Maybe
-the Cavaliers are hungry, also, but we have bigger appetites
from bigger schedules. After all, they can’t have their grits

and eat them, too.
vFor another thing, the

Panthers still haven’t de-

veloped an offense. steadyenough to show ‘any kind of
potentiality. Penn State will be coming up soon and,
off: their showing against West Virginia last Saturday,
doing them in will entail much more than strict ground
plays. The offense may start clicking for. good, with the

pressure oif. " .

One more reason why a comfortable margin would be
very clever at this point has to "do with personnel. Fans
haven’t had a look at the complete squad in action yet,
simply because the games so far have been too close to
permit Dawson to do much experimentingwith the reserves.

Three sophomore backs-have been languishing on the

bench for this reason, along wiﬂi three letterman ball
riers who have seen little action.

Initial Win .
Still, Slippery
To Booters

Tuesday afternoon brought
another defeat to the Pitt
booters who lost to Slippery‘
Rock by the score of 4-0. The
injury-ridden panthers, slow-

- ed down by the loss of three

players, including Norm Zan-
ardelli, played a defensive game
throughout but made several mis-
cues——enough to give Slippery
Rock the goals necessary for the
win. _

. Don Corbett, who switched from
his halfback position to take’ over
center half, played a very com-
mendable game.

All eyes will be focused on Pitt‘
Stadium next Wednesday at 3 p.m.
when the Panthers play the ﬁrst
home soccer ‘game in history
against Slippery Rock. I

Last year a survey of leading colleges
throughouththecountry showed that
smokers in ‘those colleges preferred

Luckies to any other cigarette. ,
This year another nation-wide survey a
-based on thousands of actual student
interviews, and representativeof all
students in regular colleges.—sh_ows that

Luckies lead again over all brands, regu-

lar or king size ...and by a Wide margin!

The No. 1 reason: Luckies taste better.

Smoking enjoymentis all a matter of
E, and the fact of the matter is Luckies
taste better —.for 2 ‘reasons. L. S./ M.F.T.
—Lucky Strike means ﬁpe tobacco. And

 Luckies are made better to taste better.
