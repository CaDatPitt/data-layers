More than 20 years ago, a man went
to Philadelphia and, after a lifelong
struggle, “lostit.” He shavedhisbeard,

Later camethe hormones, the name
change and the surgeries.

Now, Wendi Miller scratches her

her life—aﬁerher decisionto become

as part ofthe trans community — in
her case, as a biological man who be-

More than 250 student voices echoed

This scene played out at the ﬁrst

‘ The PittPendulums performed “Al-

- “It feels bad now, but it’s gonna get
better some day,” the group belted.
When SGB PresidentMolly Stieber
spoke, she lauded PitI—-— andthethree
otherstate-related schools—asagreat
investmentfor Pennsylvania.
Legislators drifted in and out as
the students’ voices carried from the
staircase through the chambers and
oﬂices. State Rep.MatthewBr_adford of
the 70th District, which includes parts
of Montgomery County, was among
thosewhowatchedtherally.Hundreds
of people witnessed the event as they

Former Philadelphia Mayorjohn
Street, who is now a faculty member ’
at Temple University, also attended
the event. .

“Nothingismore inﬂuentialtoaleg-
islator than to see these young people .
involved and show they care,” Street
said. “Hopeﬁ.1llythe1egislatorswill so-
ber up to the seriousness and political
implications.” -

Pitt Chancellor Mark Nordenberg
also made abrief appearance, shaking
students’ hands fora minute before re-
treating so the students could have the
attention. Laterinthe day, Pitt spokes-

manjohn Fedele confirmed that the
chancellor met with some legislators,
but could not say what speciﬁc topics
they discussed or which legislators he
met.

“Students  this effort and
personalized the needs of higher edu-
cation and par1icularly Pennsylvania’s
research universities, andthiswill cer-

following the rally.

Pitt sophomore Danielle Cameron
said she heard of the rally from Board
member Emily Hoover. Cameron said
it was exciting to see all the different
schools cheer and come together.

“I think the message was sent in
many different ways and got a lot of
people’s attention,” Cameron said. I

Keep eyes on
aid controversy

time, and consequently, it’s
grit-your—teeth time for cash-
strapped college students.

OK maybe it’s not that bad. But
for many college students, the rum-
blings over federal student aid pro-
grams in seemingly far-away Capi-
tol Hill could soon become quite

It’s federal budget proposal

l personal, like, not-being-able-to-
pay-tuition personal. So stay on '

top of it. It’s your money and your
education (which, because it affects
employment opportunities, is also
your future money).

In the crosshairs this time is
the Pell Grant, a need-based grant
that has been sponsored by the De-
partment of Education since 1965.
The Pell ‘Grant helps millions of stu-
dents from low-income families
pay for undergraduate education.
With a surge in Pell applications
over the last three years — mostly
recession—induced — the taxpayer-
supported program is on track to
fall $20 billion in the red by 2012,
hence the stir among policymak-
ers.

Last Friday, House Republicans
released a FY 2011 budget proposal
—- remember, the U.S. government
is running ona last—minute con-
tinuation of the 2010 budget that
expires in March — that seeks
to cut the per-year maximum for
Pell Grants by 15 percent, or from
$5,550 to $4,731. Mark Kantrowitz,
publisher of the FinAid.org ﬁnan-
cial aid website, wrote that by in-
trinsic mechanisms, this reduction
could strip aid eligibility from up to
1.7 million low-income students.
This means that almost one-ﬁfth
of current loan recipients would
be cut from the program, with the
rest having to brunt more of their
college costs. _

Although it might be true that
some young people choose to at-
tend college for the wrong rea-

sons — refer to Tuesday’s staff

editorial on career-tracking —
pushing policy that trims college
attendance on the basis of demo-

graphics clearly misses the point.

In fact, making college education
harder to ﬁnanceis the last thing
the government should be doing
in an age when tuition ascends its
exponential staircase, and foreign
countries’ degrees—per-capita rates
do laps around those of the United
States.

Programs that make under-
graduate learning less a function
of your parents’ savings account -

programs like the Pell Grant’ — are‘

crucial to the future. _

Judging from his proposed FY
2012 budget, President Barack
Obama seems to understand this.
And his statement Monday that
“education is an investment that
we need to win the future” is more
than just lip service with a poorly
developed tagline. The president’s
budget proposal, released Mon-
day, extends the Pell Grant’s $5,550
maximum award, though making
compensatory cuts to other pro-
grams. For example, under the
Obama proposal, graduate students
would have to pay interest on their

loans during the semester, which
the government currently subsidiz-

es. In addition, the pilot program
that allows award-qualifying ap-
plicants two Pell Grants in a single
year would end.

Though these measures might
be painful for some, if Obama’s pro-

posedcuts buttress the larger Pell -

Grant program, they might be jus-
tiﬁed. But with millions of Ameri-
can students receiving ﬁnancial aid
(about 2,000 Pitt students, accord-
ing to the. College Board), that deci-
sion shouldn’t be simply left in the
hands of Obama-or Speaker of the
House John Boehner. It’s students
who will be the direct beneﬁciaries
(or victims) of what’s to come. So
speak up and stay informed. I

To the Editor,

The Feb. 14, 2011, article titled,
“Pitt a gay-friendly campus,” se-
verely misrepresents how LGBTQ-
friendly Pitt’s campus is. The cam-
pus is completely ignorant of many
LGBTQ issues and remains neutral

I at- best on others. Currently there

is no University—sponsored train-
ing offered tostudents to help them
understand LGBTQ issues, and the
only ‘LGBTQ-speciﬁc training avail-
able to faculty and staff is the Allies
Network Training, which is designed
and intended to be optional. Many
students have also expressed that

h the administration does little to

serve the needs of its LGBTQ stu-
dents and continues to ignore or
dismiss _legitimate issues faced by
these students.

Most major universities, such as
Penn State and Syracuse, have dedi-
cated LGBT resource centers with
trained, full-time staff that can serve
the needs of their campus. Though
the Rainbow Alliance attempts to
serve the needs of the LGBTQ com-
munity at Pitt, there are just some
things a student organization can-
not provide. ‘

Harassment happens much more
often than an occasional shout of,

“Hey faggot,” on a Friday night. I
have personally witnessed instances
when students were harassed in the
middle of the day, where they have
felt neglected and oppressed on this
campus. Sam Rynearson’s comment
that “gay PDA is something that I
don’t think those on campus can
handle,” is a major indication of how
“gay—friendly” Pitt’s campus is. If a
sarne—sex couple cannot comfortably
behave in the same fashion as a het-
erosexual couple, then the campus
is not LGBTQ-friendly.

School of Arts 8: Sciences «-

To the Editor,

Mark Kozlowski’s Feb.-15 article,
“Chick-ﬁl-A should stay,” only pays
lip service to fair-mindedness.

While giving away free sandwich-
es does not constitute wrongful dis-
crimination, the point is Chick-ﬁl—A’s
support of and belief in anti—gay mar-
riage legislation is unconscionable.
Anti—gay marriage laws are wrong.
They are immoral. They are dehu-
manizing. The University should not
want to affiliate with a company that
openly espouses immoral and dehu-
manizing beliefs.

Kozlowski’s analogy of gun rights

was a joke. He compared support-

— ing stricter gun laws to supporting

anti—gay,marriagé legislation. The
way that analogy would work is if a
company supported a law that didn’t
allow gays to bear arms. The differ-

ence is thatthe Pennsylvania  A '

Institute and Chick—ﬁl-A aren’t try-
ing to stop everyone from getting
married —— just certain people they
don’t like.

Let’s consider a new analogy.
Take a group that has been treated as
less than citizens and make it so they
cannot legally be a family. Say that
Kozlowski’s fake company “Cow-pat-
E” is donating to groups that vigor-
ously promote enacting laws that do
not allow African—Americans to get

married. The University would not

‘ allowthis on campus out of respect

for African-American students.
Why do we treat LGBTQ people

differently?

Kozlowski is right when he says

~ that removing them would limit

choice, but the Cathedral is not a
food court in a mall. I expect more

from my University. I hope that they ‘

would want to affiliate with com-
panies that respect and encourage
the rights of the students who are
paying tuition. ‘

Stories involvingRo_n Paul mightcause

sometobreakintotears,butyoumight .

not expect why I did.

Recently I read a Christian Sci-
ence Monitor article titled, “Ron Paul
vs. Donald Trump: Who’s got a better
chance of being president?” Upon
ﬁnishing it, I sat in my bedroom and

cried.IcriedforAmerica.Icriedforthe I

RepublicanParty. But most of all, I cried
for Arnold Schwarzenegger, who will

never have the opporumity to embar- ‘

rass himselfin this manner.

The'Irump—Paulfeudbeganatlast'

week’s Conservative Political Action
Conference, duringwhich'I‘rump said
,that“whilehelikedMr.Paulpersonally,
the Texas congressman had a ‘zero’
chance of getting elected president,”

according to the "Christian Science

‘ Monitor._ -

Paul, knowingthiswasalieandthat
his chances were actually closer to 2
percent, shot back at Trump — with
avengeance.

“How many times has Donald .

Trump been elected?” he complained
on Monday’s “Morning_]oe” on MSN-
BC. “Does he have, really, the right to
go and criticize others and say they’re
[unelectable]?” ’

Paul, who alsowas sure to point out
that he’s beenvelected to public office
11 times, is himselfquite experienced
in losing presidential primary bids,
having done so in 1988 and again in
2008.

Naturally, the whole debacle re-
sulted in one of my favorite things of
all time: a celebrity catﬁght. Though
not nearly as enthralling as 'I‘rump’s
catﬁght with Rosie O’Donnell — dur-

ingwhich she mocked his comb~over_
' and cal1edhima“snake—oil salesman”

and he referred to her as his “nice fat
little Rosie” —— I suppose it will have
t0 do. ' -

Ironically, while Paul’s chances of
winningare aboutonparwiththat of
ablock ofwisconsin cheese, it’s 'I‘rurnp

A who, statistically, has a 0 percent A
. chance ofbeing elected president.

Accordingto political expertLarry
Sabato, whose website “Crystal Ball”
ranks the GOP presidential contend-
ers, Trump is dead last, with his only
advantages beingﬁiighmediavisibility

' and TV savvy,” andehis disadvantages

listed as, “no public office e:q)erience,”
“colorﬁil life/media scrutiny” and “per-
ceivedasastunt.” '
Paulwas ranked just slightly higher,
coming in at No.‘ 15 of the 19 possible

Trump-Paul feud carries little political signiﬁcance

Trump has since sought to le-
gitimize himselfby appearing on an
interview with Fox News’ Greta Van
Susteren, apparently while overlooking
some kind of Austrian castle. »

servative to being Republican.

“I’m avery conservative person. I’m
very big into the  I’m a great
guy for defense,” he said. “I am prob-

ably as conservative as anybody on '

your show, and that's going a pretty
strong step. I’m a Republican. I’rn a
very conservative Republican. Ibelieve
strongly in just about all conservative
principles.”

Personally, my favorite partof the
interview was when Trump talked
abouthis business‘ dimers with the

_ Chinese, whom he is “forced to work

with.” And I guess at these dinners, at

whichl can only_assume he is “forced”

to gobble down expensive food and
wine, the Chinese told him something

along the lines of, “Donald. We cannot
believe whatwe are getting awaywith.
We are getting away with so much.”

Accordingto CNN, “IfTrump were
towinthe electionin2oJ2, he saidhis
first action would be imposing a 25
percent tax on Chinese products to
make sure the Chinese government is
‘treatingus fairly?”

So I guess what I think Trump is
trying to tell us is that he does have
plenty ofpolitical experience. His years

Director David Truskinofl‘ hopes
he can not just entertain, but also
inspire his audiences to act like the
characters in “I-Iair.”

The show follows the lives of
a tribe of long-haired hippies in
New York City. Claude, his friend
Berger, their roommate-Sheila and

' their companions struggle to bal-

ance their own beliefs and their re-
lationships with their conservative
families with rebellion against the
war and the politics of the time.

» Truskinoff hopes that the musi-
cal’s look at the.’60s counterculture

movement will inspire young people
to raise their voices.

“During the 1960s, younger
people in their teens and twenties
and college age were so much a part
of the political goings and the pro-
tests,” Truskinoff said, remembering
the Civil Rights, feminist and hippie
movements of the time.

“They had_such a strong voice.
Sometimes, unfortunately, it isn’t the
same today‘... It can only be a good
thing for younger people to see that
now and to revisit what the move-

ment was about. I can only hope to

get it sparked up again,” he said.

- The award—vvinning musical orig-
inally opened on Broadway in 1968,
pushing boundaries the same way
its subject matter did. The show’s
use of “slang, profanity, nudity and

‘overt sexuality,” aswell as the pres-

ence of a racially integrated cast on
stage created a major stir and was
incredibly progressive for the time,

said _Richard Teaster, manager and ’

director of Pitt’s Men’s Glee Club.
One act even ended with a nude

scene, creating commotion in a cul-

ture where simply growing out one’s

hair was a radical notion.

Though the show came from a
different time period, the issues and
ideas within it remain powerﬁil and
important today, said actorjosh La-
mon,'who plays several characters in
the production, including Claude’s

father, Margaret Mead and a mem— .

ber. of the Tribe.

“It’s great because young people '
are introduced to this era that shows '

the hippie movement,” Lamonsaid.
“It isn’t just hair and ﬂowers, it was
a protest and was about how im-
portant it is to stand up for one’s
belief.” V ,

- Lamon’s hardest job is to act as
Claude’s father, a conservative who
wants his paciﬁst son to join the
Vietnam War.

“We’re so different,” Lamon said.

“I actually base the character off. of
my grandfather.» [Claude’s father]

is a conservative Republican who
believespwe have to ﬁght the war
no "matter what, and he pressures
his son to go to Vietnam. To play
this character is challenging for me,

Beyond beingan illustration of teen

Licensing allows the owner to de-

I Though album sales used to make
up the bulk of non-live revenue, the
Internet (be it through ﬁle sharing,

Trans 4 1

Wendi Miller stands in her shop, Miller Frame, Tuesday afternoon. She’s owned the store since graduating fr

role thatthat child plays based on those
characteristics —— gender. Finally, there
is how someone feels in terms of his or
her own gender — gender identity.

A NewLife

Perched on a stool in Miller Frame,
the Piusburgh shop she’s owned since.
graduating from Carnegie Mellon in
1972, Miller explained that not under-
standing the difference between sexu-
ality, sex and gender led to her 40-year
confusion.

“[I was] ﬁnding myselfattracted to
the girls, wantingto be one of_ the girls,
and once I reached my physical ado-
lescence  also physically attracted to
them too  it confused me horribly,”
Miller said. _

In college, when her name was Wil-

, liam Miller, she once experimented

with homosexuality, but she realized
she wasn’t gay. Eventually, she married
a woman and they had a son named
Cooper.

Miller, now 64, made a point of dif-
ferentiatingbetween sexualityand gen-
der, explainingthat“trans”has nothing

to do with whom you’re attracted to.
“There just seems to be no way to
make [sex, gender and gender identity]

allline up, exceptchangingthe physical .
. and the [gender] role,” she said.

But altering biology is a long and
often painful process.

A man becoming a woman must
takewhatMillerjol<ingly_called“leﬂ1al”
amounts ofhormones.-Thenthere’s sur-
gery-——-breast implants, castrationand
vaginoplasty——and electrolysis, which
Millerjests “separates thegirlsfromthe
guys.”Millerhadalloftheseprocedures
performed. '

Then there are the issues of docu-
mentation and legal identiﬁcation.

The state of Pennsylvania allowed
Miller to change her sex on all forms
after having her surgeries. During the
transition, she chose to use “W. Miller”
on credit cardsand documents to avoid
confusion, butthepreliminary measure
meanteventuallypickinga“W”women’s
name.

Whitney Houston, that’s too over-the-
top. So therewas really just no choice, it
was goingto be Wendi  It was almost
by default,” she said.

In addition to physical pain andhle-

. gal1ogistics,thereare,other diﬁiculties,

particularlywithfamily. ‘ -
Millerhadbeeninmarriage counsel-
ingwith her wife before going to Phila-
delphia for business. Upon’ returning
hometo  she conﬁdedinher
counselorthatshevmnted to become a
woman. The counselor advised her not
to tell her wife, ‘but she did and soon

found herselfdivorcedandactingas her

own lawyer in a custody battle.

During the divorce process, Miller
had to come out to Cooper, who was 9 at
the time. Cooper said, “Itwas different
and it was somewhat strange because I

didn’t have any contextto understand it,
butwhenyou’re acertain age, the world
throws awholebunch of sniff at you, and
you don’t understand it and you’re in a
state of more acceptance.’ ’.

At 13, Cooper chose to live with
Wendi.

“Ithinkalotoftranssexuals shutout
their family  and Wendi very inten-
tionally chose not to —whichItl1ink is
probably the best thing she could have

' done,” he said.

Most kids go through atime ofbeing

Wendi. His mother encouraged him to i

keep mumabouthisfather—perhapsto
protecthimfrombullies—makinghim
feel as though he should be ashamed.

But he wasn’t, andlivingwith Wendi
gave him support in unique ways.

“I went through puberty the same
time my father did basically  It was a
differentfather/son relationship because
it was more complex. Both of us were
going through.physiological changes
speciﬁc, to the genders we were goin
into,” he said. i -

Though Wendi and Cooper were .

comfortable with their situation, they
were still hesitantto share their experi-
ences withpeople outside their immedi-
ate family. Coopersaid Wendi pondered
evetystep of coming outandfound sup-

port online.

“Wlthout the anonymity, theykwere .

too afraid to talk about what they really
felt  PTSG started online. It’s a fasci-
nating thing, too, because it shows that
society and technology are developing
in tandem,” he said.

This isn’t unusual, said Lombardi, the
transgender researcher. She noted that
the Internet and particularly features like '
AOL chat rooms have beenvital tools in
helping trans people ﬁnd acceptance.

: . With college comes a new gender

Many years after Wendi Miller be-
gan using AOL chat rooms as a forum

, for trans discussion, Dylan Drobish

explored his own struggles on the In-
temet.

The Pitt student, who once identiﬁed
as abisexualwoman,was exposedtothe
idea of trans lifestyles through Rainbow
Alliance, an advocacy group for home-
sexual, bisexual, transgender and queer
students and their allies.

He’d known for a long time that he
wasn’t comfortable as a woman.

‘Now22, he recalls growingup inthe :
verysmalltownofLarksville, Pa., about
35 minutes outside of Scranton. There,
he attended Catholic school. His name
wasElise. ‘

“Thoseskirtswereﬁ.in,”hesaidsar- I

castically. “I remember the exact day in

' third grade I just startedwearing shorts

school  just because itwas so uncom-
fortable for me.”

“I didn’t know how to be graceful

came a point'at which he realized his
gestures and activities were much more
characteristically male. I

lot of ways,” he said. _

After meeting several trans people,
he became “obsessed” with reading
books and watching YouTube videos in
which people chronicled their changes.
He realized he might be interested in
becominga man. Eventually, he decided
to document his own transition in the
form of YouTube videos.

Drobish had dabbled in masculine
dress all his life with Halloween cos-
tumes like the blue Power Ranger, Link
the elf, and Angus Young of AC/DC. The
ﬁrsttime he performed dragatthe 2009
drag show, he brought out school-boy
shorts like the ones he used when por-
traying Young.

He now performs drag in his group
Hot Metal Hardware, considering him-
selfa drag king because he is satirizing
different types of masculinity. It was
while performing in these shows that
he realized he’d like to be a man.

“This is not just somethinglwantto

’ pretend to do,” he remembered think-
ing. “It’s the way I feel, the way I made
myself. There’s a conﬁdence here that
I can’t ﬁnd anywhere else. It didn’t feel
likepretending.” ' .

Drobishcan recall the various points
of his transition very clearly.

On Jan. 29, 2010, he had his ﬁrst
meetingatPERSAD, asupport group for
gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender
people. On March 10, 2010, he received
his ﬁrst shot of testosterone. After, he

and his friend celebrated with an “It’s

. aboy” cake. . V V

he said. In justthe lastyear, his shoulders

“Itreally is [like puberty], it’s exactly
the same thing. Yourvoice starts squeak-

‘ there’s also more hair growth and an
increased sex drive.

After he came to Pitt, student Dylan Drobish decided to transition from a biological wo

also opt to get surgery. While Drobish
would like to have the expensive upper-
body surgeryto removehisbreasts, he’s
not interestedinthe far-from-perfected

surgery that either fashions a penis or

cuts the clitoris to act as one. Drobish
said he must wait because, as a college
student, he doesn’t currently enough
rnoneyforthe procedure. I

’ Income aside, he’s found that col-

lege is avery accepting setting and that

the autonomy allows many people to .

feel freer.

“Obviously, a lot of people’ do ﬁnd
out in college because you’re not doing
anythingfor anybody else anymore and

you’re like ‘well what if I do this?” he .
‘said-.
Though friends have mostly been '

accepting, some have nottaken the tran-
sition as Well. Drobish sites diff1culties_

. primarily with older generations he

encounters.
Often the discrepancy between his
appearance and his legal name -—— as

. he hasn’t had the ability to change it

from Elise to Dylan — forces Drobish

to explain himselfirnmediately when a t

 

professor takes attendance for the ﬁrst
‘time in a class.

“I do enjoy being a voice and being
out there foreverybody, but I want it
to be on myterms  like ifI’m goingto
tell somebody I’m going to tell them,”
he said. . '

One situation in which his story

comes out rather quicklyis dating. Dro-
bish has been in relationships since his I

transition.

He identiﬁes as queer, citing that
he used to identify as bisexual, but felt
thatthe term implied there are only two
genders. As atransgender man, he feels
that isn’t the case.

Still, there are always many factors

“It depends on the person and the
whole package, so it’s not really about
what you’ve got between your legs,” he
said. ,

Drobish has seenan increase in this

“I thought about this too. I look at I

the idea of gender queer comes in.

Being gender queer means that you

but it is interesting, especially because I see
older generations relate to the parents in the
show.” V V .

Considering recent events in Egypt and
even the current political divide in the United
States, the messages in “Hair” and the views of
all the characters remain incredibly relevant
as people struggle to make themselves heard
today, Lamon said.» .
' The music in “Hair” is just as important
as the story. Teas/ter mentioned in an e—mail
that the songs that presented their messages
in ways that were less “in your face,” such as
“Aquarius/Let The Sunshine In,” can still be
heard on oldies stations today.

But the ironic songs were not received well
at the time it came out, Teaster said.

“From a purely musical perspective, the

i show was not well-received by such legendary _

Broadway composers as Leonard Bernstein
and Richard Rogers,” Teaster said. “Bernstein
remarked, ‘the songs are just laundry lists.”’

The music has also proved to be a major in-
ﬂuence on more recent works, Teaster said.

“I think the work inﬂuenced other pieces
which would incorporate more rock. idioms
such as ‘Tommy,’ ‘Jesus Christ Superstar’ and
evenshows asrecent as  ‘Spring Awaken-
ing,”’ he said. ” ' -

Viewers get down with cast

working on “Hair” immediately after the end
of the revival tour of “Rent” last year.

But portraying the turbulent time period
these songs came from is an immense task
which required time and research long before
production began, Truskinoff said.

In addition to trying to make the showas

authentic as possible, Lamon also sought to
T maintain the atypical interaction between the

cast and audience actually pulls the audience
into the show. .
“At the end of the show, the entire audience
is invited on stage to dance with us,” Lamon
said. “It is remarkable to see people let go and
hug each other, and to look out and see people
dancing in the aisles and holding hands. You

_don’t get that with other shows.”

Even the 10 —piece band gets into the show,

standing on stage rather than sitting in an or— .

chestra pit and allowing interaction between

the instrumentalists and the characters, even
though the band isn’t always a key part of the a

plot. ‘ .- _
While all of the musical’s themes are de-
livered in an entertaining fashion, Truskinoff

_ approaches “Hair” with respect, feeling that
it allows serious commentary on issues such '
as the war today and where civil rights issues

stand. 1
“The underlying themes remain real today

Murphy criticized their lack of licensing.

. From Murphy’s view — accentuated with a
“F**k you, Kings of Leon” in The Hollywood Re-

of popular songs can inspire kids to participate in
a glee club or start to play an instrument, and for
this reason, Kings ofLeon’s reﬁxsalto license their
songs results in a great loss.

Kings of Leon seemed shocked by the anger
directed at them as they were promoting “Use

to license their songs. They said they hadn’t seen

his team would continue to play its

physical portion of Pitt’s notoriously
rough workouts. Monday aftemoon.

“We’ll see what the doctors say

“Ashton already told me he’s play-
ing, but he told me that last Monday,”
Dixon said. “We can’t go too much by
how he feels. We have to go by what
the doctors see on the MRI.” ,

Without Gibbs, Pitt (23—2, 11-1 Big '

East) relied on timely inside scoring
and defense to defeat West Virginia
and Villanova.

“With the ﬁrepower of our of— Q

Near the end of the Panthers’ run, Provi—
dence coach Phil Seymore threw his suit coat
on the court in frustration over a non-call as
the teams jostled for a rebound. He received
a technical but was not ejected. He never put
the coat back on.

The outburst ﬁieled Providence to a come— ’

back of its own. Two turnovers from Harrison
in the game’s ﬁnal minutes gave the Friars a
late 57-56 lead. '

“I thinkwe had afew mental lapses,” Chel-
sea Cole said. “We got the lead, we got too ex-
cited and we started to turn the ball over. But
then we weathered the storm by getting stops
and getting scores.” '-

Harrison made up for her errors with the ‘
game-winner. -

Cole ﬁnished with another double~double,
her Big East—leading 14th of the year. She ﬁn-
ished with 13 points and 13 rebounds.

“She was amazing tonight,” Berenato said.
“She was everywhere. I also thought she did a
really great job on hedging and helping.”

Cole’s dominance in the paint covered up a
poor night for Pitt’s perimeter shooting. The
Panthers didn’t hit a 3-pointer all night — not
that they minded. They’re making noise in
the Big East a month before theconference
tournament.

Berenato said that the early-season schedule" 

gave "Pitt a record not indicative of its talent.
“We had a reallytough schedule,” she said.
“For us to weather the storm in December and
January  I just kept saying, ‘We have to get to
