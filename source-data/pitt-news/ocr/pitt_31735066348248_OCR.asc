BOB HEISTR

 

BY TOM SMITH
A plan proxiiding for the public
ﬁnancing of Student Government
(SG) elections is under reconsider-
ation after being approved! by the
Student Government Elections
Committee (SGEC) at a meeting

Monday. 7 _
The plan is part of a set of by laws

,,\_re ulatingythe elections to be held

in _Janua and is additional to a
restructured ‘and possibly pe -
manent elections code, whic ~w
be submitted to the Student Go -
ernment Board tonight for its
approval. \

The public ﬁnancing p‘ 11 pro-
posed by Elections Co mittee

member Bob Heister stipulated
that Student Government allocate
$500 for campaigning to be divided
among‘ candidates for office.

Presidential candidates will receive
more money than board can i-

dates. Additionally, all campai n’

material was to be processed by t e
elections committee, according to
Hesiter’s motion which read: “The
SGEC will execute all campaign
cjntracts and all contracts will be
e ec ed through the UniversLty.”

The plan is being reconsid red,-
according to Elections Committee
cliairman Chuck Diedrich, so the
SGEC can submit a more compre-
hensive plan_ to the public. _ He
expects to hold public hearings on
the issue of campaign ﬁnancing in
the near future.

“I plan to call on all studen
organizations and advertise s
interested members of the Univer-
sity community concerned with th
issue of public ﬁnancing will be
heard, ’ Diedrich sad. i “In that
way e can come} up with a
thorough _and acceptable plan of
campaign ﬁnancing.” ’

The Heister proposal was ap-
proved by the committee 4-0 with
Diedrich and committee member,
John iRohe abstaining.

Thoiigh Rohe approved of public
financing he objected to‘ Heister’s
plan saying, “It limits creativity.”
Rohe, however, suggested ian al-P

Health Professions Role

Argued at Union Hearings

BY SCOTT MACLEOD

Pitt's administration continued
their attempt yesterday at the
Pennsylvania Labor Relations
Board hearings to prove that the
schools of the health professions
should be included in one collective
bargaining unit along with all other

departments and schools in the/

University.

All six unions party to the
hearings, which are being conduct-
ed downtownvin the State Office
Building, are opposed to -the

éi‘Tadministration’s view, arguing the

health professions are dissimilar in
many ways to other facets of Pitt
and thus should be excluded from

an all-encompassing unit.

issue.

Both were cross examined by
counsel for parties in the unioniza-
tion hearings, which broke up
Tuesday and will reconvene De-
cember 11 and 12.

In his testimony, Forrest explain- .

ed he sends the dental school
budget directly to the vice
chancellor of business and ﬁnance
for approval, and not the vice
chancellor of Health Professions.
“From ‘what I understand, all
ofﬁcialwdealings are to be made
_with'the chancellor of the Universi-
ty," Forrest said, “and that the
vice Chancellors exist simply to
expedite matters. In this case, our

budget goes directly to the finance ‘C

involved. Each candidate would be
provided with materials and it
would not infringe on their creativ-
ity. Each person would be limited
to the exact same amount and we
would not be limiting campaign
material.”

Heister said, however, his plan
would insure that all candidates,
would have an equal chance of
being elected. “In this way e can
make sure everything is h dled
uniformly for each candidate,” he
said. “‘By having the University to-
the wéprk any kind of cozy relation-
ship is eliminated.”

Money Issues Pressure

CA5 Councl. Decisions

BY SUSAN MANNELLA

' Approval of proposed new courses
and programs, reviews of existing
ones and interpretation of rules of
_the College of Arts and Sciences
(CAS) were cited as the major tasks
confronting CAS Council by Dean
Robert A. Marshall at the Council's
meeting Tuesday.

’< “An increase in ideas and ‘propo-
sals to the Council and tightening
of the University’s budget” has
pressured "the Council to produce
more decisions than they can
consider in a short time period,
according to Marshall.‘ “It was
very easy ‘to approve programs
when there was room for growth.
Now everybody knows that if
something is approved, something
else must be eliminated.”

Assistant Dean Marcia Landy
suggested “prior studies and re-
commendations could be done by
subcommittees, people who have
some competence in the area being
considered” to reduce time pres-
sure on the Council. Political
Science Professor Richard W. Cot-
tam said he felt councils should be
provided with staffs to perform
those functions. Formation of
subcommittees was tabled until
Council's next meeting.

Marshall called the Council's
function of interpreting rules “the
most frightening” of the tasks
because it includes the College's
position on late withdrawal. from
courses, grading, admission policy,
and other related academic mat-
ters.

marked the first daily oﬁﬁthe trike
which has closed mines 25 tes
and choked off 70% of he nation’s
coal supply. Some union mines in
the West continued to operate.

The Tennessee Valley Authority,
with only a. 42-day coal supply,
urged governors in its seven-state
power service ‘area to. take
emergencyaaction to reduce electri-
cal use “to avoid or‘ postpone
cutoffs which could result from a
prolonged coal strike.”

The strike took its first toll in
employment as the Penn Central
Railroad laid off 1,500 workers, and
the
The ' hessie System, another major
coal hauler, said it would lay off
workers ter this week.

Most s elmakers continued op
erating ormally, bilt U.S. steel
said i? is banking nine of its blast
furdaces immediately and eight
more by Friday, resulting in layoffs
of 13,700 employehs by week‘s

companies say they have a
two-to’-three week upply coal

curtailing production this week.
Steel cu acks would quickly ripple
through other industries, forcing
widespread layoffs ‘in autos,
construction and appliances.

The fedjral government, for the
tim be ng, nihas adopted Ha
s-off policy to avoid interfer-
ing in the negotiations. But Labor
Se etary Peter J. Brennan ndi-

cated the administration would

,invoke the ,Taft-Hartley Act ﬂto
order the men back to work if they
rejected a ‘tentative settlemdnt
“and the strike looks like it’s going
on longer.,’,’ ‘

Union and industry egotiators
have tentatively agreedi on a large
part of the new three-year contract
with the snarl apparently over the
final trade-offs between money
issues and noneconomic demands.

bargainer, has said the q final

Miners currently average between
$42 and $50 H a ‘day, a rate
comparablewith the auto and steel
industries. But unlike auto and
steelworkers, miners get no sick
pay or cost-of-living increases.

Also, their retirement pensions of
$150 a month are liess than half of
what most other industrial workers
receive.

Miller also has mad safety a
priority issue in the n go iationf,
noting Monday in the ‘ﬁn 1 hou s

points, the sources said, were the

fublic Financing of SG Elections Proposed

(Continued from Page 1)

Reﬂectlng on" the value of public
ﬁnancing Diedrich said, “Public
ﬁnancing gives every candidate a
fair and equal chance in campaign-_
ing regardless of economic status
and it prevent someone with a lot of
money to have an unfair advan-

i tage.” 0

The Student Government Consti-
tution mandates the election code

i be approved by the Student Gov-

ernment Board, but the SGB
cannot unilaterally change any

' f/ssgrovisions in the code,
‘ “The code which is being submit-

ted to the SGB tonight was origin-
ally written by the former chairman
of the Elections Committee Betty
Nelson upon the request of SG
President Mike Furick. So the code
would not have to be revised
annually Furick asked Nelson to
write a permanent elections code.

“The elections committee has only
two months to put together a code

and they are very hard pressed for
time,” she said. “A permanent
code would eliminate the need to
rewrite the code every year.”
Nelson also incorporated a set of
by laws to complement the code.

“I restructured the election code so
it could be a permanent structure in
Student Government. Things that
don’t have to be changed from year
to year like eligibility requirements

l and voting regulations are in the

permanent code. The by-laws
contain things like public ﬁnancing
which can change from year to
year.”

The new code will eliminate many
loopholes in the election process,
according to Nelson, who consulted
other schools’ elections codes, and
the state and federal election codes
to prepare the code. .

“Previously, SG equipment was
used for campaigns, which is kind
of ridiculous,” she said. “Using
the SG offices as a campaign
headquarters is a serious conflict of

interest. The code also deﬁnes
write-in candidates. Serious write-
in candidates‘ will also have pro-
visions to abide by andthe provis-
ions dealing with write-in candi-
dates deﬁne more clearly the SGEC
jurisdiction over write-in candi-
dates. -

“The new code clariﬁes discip-
linary procedures. It clariﬁes the
hearing process
election and post election contests.
That was very nebulous in the old-
code. ’

Diedrich considers the new code
“very extensive and very
thorough.” “Betty took a look at
all the hassles last 'year and
eliminated them,” he said.

In order for the code to become
permanent, however, it n\1ust be
approved as an amendment to the
SG constitution. The SGEC voted
dpwn a’ motion calling for the SGB
to initiate the processes of placing
the code on the ballot in January.

 Conflict of Interest

The elections code regulating the Student Government elections held

 in January will be submitted to the Student Government Board (SGB)

5‘; for its approval tonight. '

"1The structures of Student Government require that the code be

I . approved by the SGB before it can go into effect. The Board however

" may not alter unilaterally any provisions in the code.

‘ ‘Often many Board members either run for re-election or seek a higher

X ofﬁce raising the issue of conﬂict of interest when they, as prospective

, candidates, sit ‘in judgment of ,a code which will regulate ‘their
 campaigns. ,

. There have been instances in the past when Board members have
been involved in serious conﬂicts of interests relative to the election

I , campaign ﬁnancing, distance of campaigning from the polls on election

’ day, and campaign material. -
’ ,We suggest, then, those board members who are or who might be
candidates in January refrain from voting on the election code. Only in
thiswaycantherebyaguaranteetheywillnotcastvotesonmatters
-  , which will positively affect their campaign andin effect be a conflictoof
interest.

Furthermore, due to the nature of the Student Government Board as a
a political body, members of the SGB whci will not be candidates next
 year may involve themselves -in partisian arguments concerning the
 elections process. In s.ome instances they might want to promote the
_ I candidacy of a friend orrdamage the candidacy of a political foe. Such
,_ . 7-  conduct is reprehensible and should not occur this year. Such hijinks
7', I  will not be tolerated. '
I ' I But, this raises a far greater question? Should the politically oriented
’_ Student Government Board be involved to any extent in the elections
‘process? We think not. The elections processishould be under the sole
authority of the Student Government Elections Committee and the
Student Government Judicial Board. -.

:iﬁBurning the Mortgage

I _ The Pitt administration, especially Chancellor Wesley Posvar, should
be commended for eradicating a $27 million debt incurred nearly a
decade ago. ’ .
 2 The University announced nearly a month ago payment on the debt
'7 i~ "/was completed. Chancellor Posvar said, ‘fit’s ﬁtting that we put this
: " chapter to a close. , We shouldn’t be hindered by this albatross any
’ ‘:longer.”
The debt was incurred during the chancellorship of Edward Litchﬁeld
and led to Pitt-’s rmve to state related status in 1966.
r In light of the increasing rate of inﬂation which has besieged the
‘H . .nation since the late 1960’s it is amazing the University has been able
to complete payment on the debt in only eight years. Additionally, the
debt was repaid with only minimal tuition increases during the last few
years. It has been repaid at a time when many colleges and
universities closed their doors due to bankruptcy.
The administration will burn the mortgage on April 1, 1976. And we
hope this means the University will ease some of the cost cutting
’ measures and maintain its commitment to students, not only
academically but also ﬁnancially. _, -

Fighting Tenure for the Kid

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

“Professors, you may be wonder-
ing why l’ve ‘called you heretonight
to this alley, and instructed you to
wear ski-masks.’

Among the dented garbage cans
an i the orange crates shadowy
ﬁgures nodded their heads.

‘‘I have just received word from
our contacts in the dean’s office
that the enemy ad hoc committee
has decided to propose Edgar Allen
Zoot fortenure!”

A growl of dismay and /anger
swept the group, several professors
slipped the safety off
well-oiled M-16's.

“What’ll we do, commander?”
asked one guerilla, pdlishing the
rim of a grenade launcher.

“Tonight we strike on .the 11th
Tonight
we’re going to decide forever just
who is running this University,
them or us,”. said the commander.
He looked over the forms of his
men, noting with approval that
stoclfy Macintosh of the Scottish
Medieval Literature department
had stationed himself at the
entrance of the alley. Macintosh
had been the leader of the recent
suicide attack and burning of the
Neoclassic Library.

It had been in retribution for the

' defilement of several copies‘, of

poetry by Rop rt Burns which had
been found na led to trees on the
Commons. -

“Load up men," the commander
‘said. “When we received work,
move out to your check points.
There will be drinks afterwards in
my office."

“By God’s bones!” muttered
Macintosh. “Let me at ’im.” .

Easy Mac," said the commander.
‘‘If you lose your head you’ll wind
up dead, just /like the Kid."
Everyone was silent for a moment.

Through their minds, right next to I

cdnsiderations of publications and
new Mercedes Benzs floated the
image of the Kid. .

He had only been 67 years old,
and he had lied -to get into the
Service. With the youthful

' foolishness of the inexperienced,

he had spoken out at a faculty
meeting against the injustices of
tenure. Macintosh lllld found him

The campus police had called it

even want to think about what he
went through before he died.
Sometimes he heard stories from
the old-timers that made it hard to
sleep at night.

“Men,” snapped the commander,
breaking the momentum of inner
dwelling, “remember the Kid
when we hit tonight, and this is big
one. As usual, we'll take no
prisoners.” .

They waited now for the signal
from a secret agent they had
planted in (‘me of the enemy's
classes. The commander permitted
them to smoke.

Then without warning, from the
immeasurable * distance to the
University Stadium, there was a
ﬂash of light that seared the eyes.

The commander felt himself
tossed against ‘the walls of the
alleys by some incredible heaving
of the earth. The air rushed madly
about them.

Later, when they had all regained
their feet in silent wonder, the
ragged form of the student spy
staggered onto the alleyway.

feet, her fairly glowed in the dark

No Tickets for
Football Game

Dear Editor,

Yesterday, liwent to the student
ticket office to get a ticket to the
Pitt-Penn State game. I was led to
understand that there would be
enough tickets for all of the
students who wished to attend, but
as I came within sight ofthe ticket
window I was greeted with a sign
that stated that all of the tickets to
the Penn State game were sold out.
There were other people there who
disturbed about the
situation as I am.‘ Well, I suppose
that it is the University’s decision
as, to whom to give the tickets to,
but whoever made the decision that
they wouldn’t go to the students
can go to Hell!

Dear Sir:

Your issue of Nov. 6th carried an
account of the recent Senate
Council meeting, according to
which “Allen Janis questioned the
feasibility of a large tenure review

' . faculty members be included in the
group." My quarrel was in fact ‘

with anger and concern, “the
enemy ad hoc committee signed a
mutual aid treaty with the physics
department. They have just tested

a nuclear device designed by those E

craven atom-jockeys."

Through the open end of th alley
you could see the loaming
mushroom cloud spreading out
over campus. ,

“What’ll we do now comman-

commander surveyed his men

Incredible and
Vicious Cartoon

Letter for publication in Pitt News

I have no wish to exacerbate the
present difficulties concerningthe
department of black studies. but I
cannot remain silent in the face of"
the incredibly _ vicious Kambic
cartoon published by Pitt News on
Wednesday, November 6. Honest
differences of opinions exist and,
no doubt, need discussion. How-
ever, the cartoon in question is so
offensive by any standards that it
deserves the reprimand offered to
the late unlamented Senator J. R.
McCarthy -- “Sir, have you no
shame?"

Ronald Bentley
Chairman, Department
of Biochemistry - FAS

Editor’s note: it should be noted

that Matt Kambic’s cartoon co

which appeared in the November 7,

“l have learned that the United
States is not New York City,”--and
that's one of the beneﬁts of Pitt’s
Tesol. an unique extension of the
Fulbright Foreign Studies Grant.
"Ten students, from Finland, Tur-
key, and Mexico, are now in
residence in an intensive six-month
international educational exchange
in American language and culture.
 “Basically, it entails learning to
:3’. teach English as a foreign lan-
 . guage,” explains Tesol’s assistant
 cﬁordinator Judy Kettering. “Each
 grantee is already experienced as
 an English instructor in his own
 country, but now has been awarded
 the all-expense paid opportunity to
 study special teaching techniques
 and American culture at Pitt.”
 . Several different Fulbright ﬁelds»
 history, engineering, economics,
 among them--were represented at
Pitt in past vears. But presently.

Fulbright Scholars in Pitt American Home  

due to cutbacks in Federal spend-
ing for the Educational Exchange
Program, of which the Fulbright
scholarships are a part, Pitt can
only afford the specialized staff for
a small group of foreign English
teachers, according to Tesol’s
coordinator, Mary Bruder.

“This University,” says Ketter-
ing, “has the most widely recogni-
zed English Language Institute in
the country.” For that reason, the
US government has designated_Pitt

as the center for Fulbright English

teachers.

As part of their curriculum, the
grantees take advanced courses in
English language and composition,
in order to write a research paper
recognized by American University
standards. The bulk ' of ‘ their
studies is devoted to the Structure

of English Linguistics, and Ameri- ‘

can Civilization.

American Civilization, in that it
offers guest lectures on such

current topics as Black Panel,

Altered Life-Style, Women’s Lib,
and Changing Religion,” Bruder
said.

A practice session gives them an
opportunity to try out their new
teaching techniques for three hours

a week with the spouses of foreign
graduate students wanting to learn
English. One such practice session
is given by Rauni Tuohimaa, of
Finland.

from countries including Russia,

in New Zealand in American History and Urban_-Studies.

-tense patterns and sentence struc- 
tures, becomes more complicated

as the hour goes on. The exercise
expands from “mail a letter” to “I

am going to mail this letter at two
o’clock tomorrow.” «

A goal intensely shared by all the
group--to motivate the students in
their own country and interest
them in a foreign language.
Comments and suggestions abound
at the coordinator’s meeting with
Bruder.

“I give my students fairy tales, for
the simple content and vocab-
ulary," says a member from
Mexico, “but they consider them \
too naive, and they get bored." 

“My students don’t like to read in

' English. They don’t even like to
‘read in their own language.”

“My students don’t want Shakes-
peare’s classics. They want Stein-
beck and Hemingway. They want
to hear about politics, and racism,
and social change in America."

“How can we choose a text
dealing with current issues, when
these current issues become out-
dated so quickly?"

If these problems sound vaguely
familiar it’s no coincidence.

In addition to their studies, the
Fulbright scholars lead a full life
outside the university. For thei'*_—/g
first six weeks they live in the

ll7ays to Play Pittis   Dorm-living   “me

BY BARB MUROCK

“To make the residence halls at
the University of Pittsburgh more
than just a place to eat and sleep"
is the philosophy of the Univer
sity's Office of Residence Life.
Last year the office instituted, on
an experimental basis, a number of
alternatives to the typical approach
to dormitory living. Deemed a
success, this program, Alternatives
in Life Styles, is continuing this
year.

“Our program is designed to
emphasize the over-all‘ University
experience that blends. living ,and

dence Life.

The new dormitory areas include a
Health Related Professions Unit, a
Graduate Unit, an Intensive Study_
Unit, Spanish and French Cultural
Units,’ Reduced Visitation Units
and an Alternative Curriculum
Unit. According _to Tim Snyder,
assistant to the "director of the
Office of Residence Life, these
units grew as a direct result of
student interest. Each of the units
will exist only as long as enough

students enroll in the unit, ‘and the

ofﬁce is open to suggestions for
new units.

The Intensive Study Unit, oc-
cupying the llth through 16th
floors of Tower C is a case in point.
“Intensive Study students tend to
be quieter. This creates a better
community," Snyder said.

Rolando Alum, Resident Assis-

tant (RA) for the 16th»ﬂoor,_ was
quick to point out the.students were
not unsociable. “The students do
things together, there is something
going on almost every Friday."
The house, nicknamed “CoCkPitt
House" had recently held a "cock-
tail patty”'in their newly dedicated
lounge, followed by a dress dinner
in the cafeteria.

Alum’s goal was to build strong
community life among the Inten-
sive Study resident. ‘ “Just the
other day, two guys found out that
they had both lived on this floor last
year--and they never knew each
other." _ This year, a strong
community spirit prevails, with
group-devised House Constitution
and By-laws and a House Code of
Conduct. “Everyone has a title

.and a job, some are serious and

others aren’t, but everyone who
wants to participate can.”

Down Fifth Avenue, a few blocks
from the "lowers and Quad resi-
dence halls, is the Hotel Webster
Hall, residence of 22 male Pitt
freshmen. This “temporary” resi-
dence, according to Assistant to the
Director of Residence Life Tim
Snyder, is the result of the Univer-
sity policy of admitting incoming
freshman without guaranteed resi-
dence. “Our committing ourselves
is a chance we take," said Snyder
who revealed Pitt accepted approx-
imately- 50 freshmen beyond the
capacity of the dorms.

The return to living in residence
halls in recent years is responsible
for the overflow. According to

group travels by bus to California,
since most have not toured the US
before. For the last month of their
stay, theyvisit the state capitals,
Olympia and Denver.

Tesol is only one facet of the
Fulbright Educational Exchange
Program. A wide variety of
opportunities are available to
American students who would like
to study abroad.

Since the F ulbright-Hays Act was
passed in 1941, the US government
has been investing in foreign
currencies to make international
study available to American youth.
Last year, $3 million was allocated

out of the federal budget for this

purpose.
Types of grants range from post--

graduate study, to departmental
research, to teaching lectureship.
Some are travel grants, which pay
the round trip fare. Others are full
grants, which cover all expenses
including transportation, room and
board, books, even personal health
insurance. _

Lately, Dr. Walter S. Glazer,
associate professor of history and
chairman of the Urban Studies
Program at Pitt received a Ful-
bright grant to lecture in ‘New
Zealand in American History and
Urban Studies.

“The grants, being highly com-‘

petitive, require certain qualiﬁca-
tions from the candidates," says
Dr. Helen Jereslow, Faculty and
Graduate Advisor for International
Studies. Candidates must be US

citizens, have a BA before the
beginning date of the grant, have
received the majority of their
credits in the US, have some
proficiency in the language of the
country, and of course, be in good
health.

“We take regional considerations
into account," she says, “so that
we don't have too many candidates

from New York, for example. And‘

also, economic need. There will
never be any questions about color,
but we suggest to a black student
that he work this somehow into his
application.”

Students should obtain applica-
tions for Fulbright Grants from
Patrick Mecham, Foreign Studies
Advisor, in Mervis Hall, before
November of their senior year.
Interviews are scheduled for the
spring.

Each foreign country participating
in the Educational Exchange Pro-
gram offers special fields of study.
Some offer a variety, while others,
like Mexico offer only one. New
Zealand, for example, has no
grants for the performance of the
creative arts. ‘ _

“Grants for the United King-
dom," mentions ~ Jereslow, “are
especially competitive, since stu-
dents are able to speak the lan-
guage." Germany, offering a vast
number of fields, would be easier
to attain. “Oddly enough, “Latin
America, not usually popular, re-
ceived a good response from Pitt
this year."

morning if we want them," said

Dave McDonald._

The students, none of whom knew
each other prior to September, are
“like a family," according to Chuck
Pearce--or “Chuck #2’‘’'’ as his
friends call him. The students,
who represent a large range of
majors, have one thing in com-
mon--sports. "Our football team
“WAR“(Webster Area Raiders)
hasia one-and-one record," said
Rory Dawson. Dawson has been
placed in the Towers, and is no
longer residing at Webster Hall,
but remains a frequent visitor.

Even those who move out are still
good friends. “We want to get a
frat started with guys of similar
interests,” Dawson explained.

Partying is one of their favorite
activities. According to Chuck
Pugar--“Chuck #1”, the partying
starts on Wednesday night with the
Early-Pre—Weekend party. From
underneath the weights he was

lifting Chuck explained, “Every-
one is invited to our parties,
especially girls." The group

wanted to make sure everyone
knew ofthe special party they were
planning November 9th, for Home-
coming.

This partying has posed a problem
with one of the permanent resi-
dents of Webster Hall, unaccus-

tomed to the rowdyness of college I T

life. “Mrs. Webster," affection-
ately nick-named by Chuck #2, has
been a resident of Webster Hall for
27 years. “She kept calling the
desk complaining about the noise
we make and she thought we were
smoking dope," said Dawson. To
prevent further problems, the gro_-
up was transferred to another iloor.

“Power tends to corrupt and
absolute power corrupts absolute-
ly.” Lord ‘Acton’s famous line
succinctly summarizes the theme of
Richard Condon's brief satire and
to a lesser "extent that of Joan
Joseph's book on American politi-
cal corruption.

The Star Spangled Crunch is both

I topical and amusing as Condon

depicts a situation in which oil

:(-‘t;-..,bal‘()_I]S and government officials

conspire to bilk the world of billions
with oil price hikes. Condon crams
an intricate plot into his 130 pages
and if some of the events and

characters seem incredible one
should remember the bizarre
quality of recent political history.

Condon argues that regardless of
which party is in the White House
the two major parties combine to
share the power and the loot
nominally known as campaign
contributions. In The Star Spangled
Crunch, only public belief in the
incentive system foils the nefarious
plotters. '

Condon ﬁlls his book with a
gallery of amusingly exaggerated
characters such as a 142 year old oil
tycoon and a woman who wins a
promotion over her husband
through her willingness to ex-
change an eye for a glass eye/TV
transmitter. The Star Spangled
Crunch is a generally. smooth-run-
ning vehicle for Condon's cynicism
and only if you look closely willyou
notice that it's a- little low on gas.

_ Condon's latest effort is not a

great book, not nearly as good as
his classic political satire The
Manchurian Candidate but I got up
in the middle of the night to finish
it. somethingl rarely do even for
much better books.

Lord, Fronklin Spor/<—up 

useful reminder that Watergate is
only the most recent in a series of
American political scandals. Joan
Joseph's lengthy essay on Water-
gate, and the background causes
and effect of American political
corruption is followed by a
collection of 15 essays from sources
including Time. Bill Moyers and
Presidents Kennedy and Nixon.
What were Watergate's prede-
cessors? A section from Kennedy's
Profiles in Courage describes the
dramatic circumstances’ in which
President Andrew Johnson's im-
peachment trial failed to convict
him by the margin of one vote.
The Credit Mobilier scandal that
involved many Congressmen dur-
ing the corruption-riddled Grant
Administration. The Teapot Dome
Oil scandal in Harding’s admini-
stration: unethical practices in the
leasing of government-owned oil
lands led to the demise of ‘several
cabinet ministers. There’s even an
article on Vice Presidents: some of
Agnew’s predecessors had diff’;
culties but none were expelled. from
office. 4.
And want of Watergate which a
piece fromlThe Center magazine
labels_ “the scandal of the

century." Joseph ‘find her essayists '

give informative chronicles of the
affair which one participant in The
Center magazine discussion ﬁnds
unique because "the dirty work
was done for powervrather than for
money." ’

The effect of Watergate on the
future is one of Joseph's concerns.
The desire of the American people
not "‘to see 'the’ abuse‘s
Watergate repeated" is for Joseph
“America's greatest hope of
winning her fight against the evils
of corruption." ’

Possible ways of preventing -a
recurrance of'Wat'ergate-style cor-
ruption include a more, distinct

BY JIM OPPENHEIMER

On every first Tuesday of the
month, at noon, there is a concert
given in Heinz Chapel by Dr.
Robert Lord. the chapel‘s organist.
Lord generally prefaces his con-
certs with a brief comment on the
music he is about to play. The

November 5 concert was a bit
different, however. as he was
joined by Donald Franklin on
harpsicord.

Lord began the concert with a
series of organ compositions by
Frescobaldi, a composer of the time
just before Bach. These’ pieces
were written to be played for
dramatic emphasis of certain im-
portant moments during the Eu-
charist, such as the elevation of the
host. It was a very good presenta-
tion, except that there might have
been a slightly longer pause bet-
ween each work, so as to remove all
doubt as to when one piece ends,
and the next begins. Due to the
position of the organ console, it is
impossible to see the organist shift
his music around after completing
a composition, so one unfamiliar
with the works must rely on the
long pause between pieces.
Franklin performed‘ several other
works by Frescobaldi on a harpsi-

Double Orgon Concerto‘

 
 

chord placed in the aisle between ,
the choir lofts. The instrument was 
pleasing visually as well as mu,s'i-’
cally. and Franklin had a good-
opportunity to demonstrate his
considerable ability on the instr't1=" 
ment. Some of the music was 
divided into unusual rhythmic pat-;-fli
tcrns. making for a very interesting ._.€
performance. ’ j l

Final work of the concert was» a,
double organ concerto by Antonio;
Soler, a Spanish composer. Soler
had written a series of concerti for
joint performance by himself and
his royal patron. The chapel where
these works probably were origin-
ally performed has two organ
easements on each side of the
chapel, and the echo effect which
dominates the concerto wouldllend»
itself to two organs of approxima
tely equal power. .4 V

As it was performed in Heinz"
Chapcl. however. one organ part
was taken by the organ. one by the
harpsichord, and the result was a_
completely different view of the”
work. It is a credit to l—Ieinz_‘
Chapel‘s excellent acoustics. and.‘
Lord's ability to keep his instru-
ment under control that the harpsi-
chord part was never drowned out.’

'They fall in love;-it goes without

saying. Neithencharacter is very
interesting. Fortunatley there is a
subplot--the futile romance bet-
ween Frau Schneider [Jocelyn
Johnson] and a Jewish grocer
[Edwin Rupert]. Their planned
marriage never takes place because
of the increasingly precarious posi-
tion of the Jew in German society,
where the Nazis are gaining power.
The dark shadow of the Third
Reich lurks behind even the most
celebratory moments of the pro-
duction.

Director Gillette Elvgren has cho-
sen to play up this sinister element
in this production. Even in the
gaiety of the cabaret itself, there is
a sense of doom. The dancers look
frail and dwarfed against the black

background. ' The laughter is too

frenzied, too forced to be real.
They laugh to keep from crying.
Henry Heymann’s detailed and
beautifully executed sets and Lyn-
ne Hemingway’s, vivid costumes
stand in sharp relief against the
black background. The design
becomes a visual metaphor for the
central image of this production.

Whether or nqlt the Pitt Panthers

ill be given a bowl bid this season
will be decided on Saturday after-\
noon when they meet the Fighting
Irish of Notre Dame. From al.‘
indications, the Panthers will have
to pull off the big‘upset against the
Irish to gain a bid to the Liberty
Bowl opposite the University of
Maryland.

Needless to say, that will be at
more difficult task for the Cats;
beating Notre Dame is hard enough
and nearly impossible on their own
field. But the Pitt squad will be
ready for the Irish as they were last
year when Wayne Bullock and
seven Panther turnovers enabled
Notre Dame to just avoid the upset.

“We played our best .-game of the
year against. Notre Dame last
season,“ said Pitt head coach
Johnny Majors yesterday at the
weekly Pitt Media Luncheon. “We
lost because we turned the ball
over seven times. But we gained
more yards against them than

_The_ Panthers will first take on
Villanova on Saturday. The wild-
cats turned in a 5-8-3 record last
season including a 5-1 defeat at the
hands of Pitt. Despite the loss of
two goalies and twojcenters, Coach
Burt .Iohnson’s club feels it has a
strong defense and an improved
offense to show the Panthers this
year.

The overall series between the
two schools shows Notre Dame
with a decided advantage of
27-ll-l. They have won the last
ten meetings and last year’s game
was the first close contest in a long
time. But the big upset has
become a way of life this _year in
college football especially last week
when several bowl-bound teams
went down to defeat.

“I think this is an exciting year in .

college football,” said Majors. “I
‘thought last Saturday was ‘very
good for the game. And I hope
from our standpoint that there’s
another ‘Black Saturday’ left.”
The Panthers are on a current ﬁve
game winning streak and have
looked better every week. The
Panther offense has developed into
an explosive unit led by Tony
Dorsett, Bruce Murphy, Karl Far-
mer, Billy Daniels, and more
‘recently freshman Elliott Walker.
The defense is another story.
-Although they aren't as stingy as
some of the more highly thought-of
squads such as Oklahoma and
Notre Dame, they have made the
_big‘ plays when they had to, and
have played well enough to win.

at Pitt was made by Burley last

week against Temple.”-
Fortunately for Pitt, the Irish have

lost several players this season for '

a variety of reasons. First there
was the incident that caused ;six
players to be dismissed from the
team earlier this year. Then, Eric

Maiorsl A ccepts Five

Johnny Majors has reached an
agreement with the Pitt Athletic

Department for an extension of his I

head coaching duties for at least
ﬁve Jyears, in an’ announcement
made by Chancellor Wesley Posvar

at yesterday's weekly football.

media luncheon. -
Technical details of .a specific

contract to coincide ‘with the new —

calendar year are not final, but the
commitment of both parties is firm.
Majors was originally hired onla
five year contract in December
1972 so the new extension will keep
him at the helm through 1979.
“This represents a vote of
confidence on our part in the
leadership ability of Johnny Majors

and our strong belief that he will‘-

steadily’continue to enhance the
quality of our . intercollegiate
athletic program,” Posvar said.
The new contract dispels the
recent rumors that Majors would
be returning to his alma mater, the
University of Tennessee, to assume
the head coaching position. The
five year extension came in the

’midst of a week's preparation for

the Notre Dame contest, a game
Pitt must win in order’ to receive 5
bid to ‘the Liberty Bowl. -But
' ' I  ' ' Myslinski“.

To

contract and the fact Pitt has been I

snubbed by several bowl officials.
“We are making this announce-
ment at this time in order to make

clear to the public that our belief in ’

Majors is not contingent upon bowl
bids , or" performance in any
particular game,” Myslinski stat-
ed. “While we_ think our record
this year has justified a bowl bid,
our plans for success are on long
term basis.” F «

Majors now has a cushion of
employment security to begin more
concrete plans — at fulﬁlling his
original objective upon coming to
Pitt -- to bring’ a national
championship to Pittsburgh.

"‘I think Pitt represents one of the;
greatest opportunities for intercol-
legiate football in the“-United
States,” Majors said. “National
championships are not built over-
night, or even in the span of ca

‘ couple years. It takes at least four
. or " five solid years to build a

champion, but with the schedule
we play, there is certainly the
possibility‘of gaining recognition
even sooner.

“I have had the most gratifying
support,from the University ad-
ministration‘ and‘ I_’m looking
orriy future y ars as at;-part’.

The Pitt Cross Country team
suffered a close defeat at Penn
State last weekend, 25-32, with
Pitt's Nick Martin finishing second
to Penn State’s Paul Stcmmer by
just three tenths. of a second.

Stemmer’s time of 24:20.2, fol-
lowed by Martin, bettered the
third place finisher, George Mahey
of Penn State, by 22 seconds.

“I‘ve never seen a race like it, ”
Pitt coach Jim Banner said. “Nick
ran with Stemmer step for step
through most of the race.”

-25:01, but the alternation contin-

’ ued with Penn State placing run-

ners in the fifth and seventh
positions.

Sophomore Terry Wiley took sixth
place for the Panthers and frosh
Dave MacDonald placed eighth,
but after that the next six places
went to Penn State.

“We’ve come a long way with
some of our runners," Banner
said.

yards, the highest total ever
against the Irish. The prospects of
tearing up the Irish defense with
two exciting backs may be too
much for the Pitt coaches to
dismiss.

The Irish know what Dorsett can
do, so the surprise factor, is no
longer there. and you can bet
they'll be keying on the Pitt
All-American. Walker's talents
may come as a surprise to Notre
Dame. But if Pitt is going to move
the ball on the tough Irish defense
which is tops in the nation, they are
going to have to earn every yard.

Taylor Expected. To

Ease Gratltiation Losses

BY JAN MATTHEWS

There will be some holes in Pitt’s
receiving corps next year with the
graduation of Bruce Murphy, Todd
Toerpper, and Rodney Clark, but
Willie Taylor, a freshman currently
playing on the Junior Varsity, will
be there to plug those gaps.

So far this season, Taylor has
liauled in 25 passes for 439 yards,
with six being good enough for
touchdowns. His biggest day so far
was against Allegheny Community
College when he corralled 12
aerials.

No slouch as a runner, he has
maintained an average of 3.5 yards
per carry, and has carried the ball
twice into the end-zone from
scrimmage.

It is a possibility, although slight,
that Taylor will not have a. chance
to display his offensive wares in a
varsity uniform.

“We have looked at him as a
defensive back, but I’d have to say
that if spring training started
tomorrow, he .would be at wide
receiver,” says coach receivers
Bob Ropér. '

The ﬁrst dissenting vote on this
proposed change came from Taylor
himself.

‘‘I think I can help the team more
as a wide receiver," Taylor said.

To help Pitt, Taylor had to first
come to Pittsburgh from his \
Verona, New York home. Coach
Jim Dyar had some unexpected
help in recruiting Taylor away from
approximately 50 other schools.

“My mother wanted me to stay
close to home,” explained Taylor,
“and Pitt is a lot closer than
Oklahoma State, my second choice.
Beside, they play pretty ‘good
football here." _

Since coming to Pitt, Taylor has
been impressive. And Roper has
words of praise for Taylor.

“He’s done an outstanding job on

According to Roper, Taylor has to

includes running more precise pass
