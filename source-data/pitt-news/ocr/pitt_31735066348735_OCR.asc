The Student Health Insurance
Advisory Committee met Thursday
to review bids for the 1975-76
student insurance package. The
Committee is expecedto approve
one of the plans later this week.

Two companies submitted bids
for the student contract--Higham,
Neilson, Whitridge & Reid, Inc.,.
and Blue Cross-Blue Shield, which

’_handled this year’s contract.
Cost of the programs’ for

individual students would be $99
under the Higham, Neilson plan,
and between $106.44 and $122.52
under Blue Cross. .

Family plans, which require that
one member be a Pitt student,
would cost $226.75 and $262.80,
respectively.

The individual student insurance
plan under Blue Cross last year
cost $73.32. The family plan cost
$192.72. .

The exact cost of the Blue Cross
plan has not been set because the
Committee‘ has several options
under the proposed contract. It can

iliusither approve the Blue Cross plan

unchanged from last year’s plan or
approve the plan with one or more
modifications from the 74-75
contract. ' '

Satinoff added that the, NAACP
march drew more. ‘participation
than did a rally sponsored by
ROAR, a Boston-based anti-busing
groupwhose motto is “Restore Our
Alienated Rights.”

CBS News estimated the NAACP
march,, endorsed by the National
Student Coalition Against Racism
(NSCAR), was attended bx 12,000
to 15,000 people, while several

_ hundred attended ROAR’s session.

Satinoff, SGB member Mary
Schwarz and SG President Larry
Platt agreed the marchers were
‘well-organized on- their two-mile
trek to the Boston Commons. They
heard a number of speakers
including NAACP President Roy
Wilkins and Boston . Chapter

Univ.-Students Talk Tuition

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

In response to demands for more
information on the impending
tuition increase at Pitt, Vice-
Chancellor of Planning and Budget
Jack Freeman met yesterday with
student government leaders to
answer questions" on University
budgetary policies.

The meeting was sparked by
concern over ﬁgures released to the
University Senate Council listing

-options for the tuition increase as

either 15% or 20%, a balance
against salary increases of 5% or
7.5%.

The session centered on methods
by‘ which the University deter-

‘%l3oslton RallyLabelecl Success

Although Satinoff called the
march successful, he added,’
“We’re not under any illusion that
one march will end racism.”

NSCAR’s 'N’ati'on‘al»" Steering
Committee held a meeting ‘Satur-
day night following the march and
voted on the group’s future
activities, according to Satinoff.

“During the week of July 23 to
August 3, anti-racist activities will
focus on desegregation in Boston
and other problems like cutbacks in
minority studies and affirmative
acttion programs. These activities
may include teach-ins, picket lines
and forums,” he said. _V

The group also agreed to sponsor
local activities in support of school
desegregation during the last week
of August and the beginning of
September. ’ ’ '

In addition, NSCAR’s second
national conference will be sched-
uled in Boston for October. I

Satinoff said that in addition to
these activities, the organization
“will continue to respond immedi-
ately to any racist acts that occur
over the summer.”

mined the planned $3.1 million
cutback announced at the Senate
Council meeting, and the lack of
information available to students
on the nature of the cutbacks. ,

When asked why students had
no access to the data, Freeman said
the information would be worthless
to students, and that publication
would have no effect on the ﬁnal
decisions.

“It’s not a decision to be made in
a democratic way,"’,Freei’nan said.
“Candidly, a reduction of this
magnitude ($3.1‘million) will be
widely unpopular,‘ but someone
must have the responsibility of
making that decision.”

Asked if there was a conscious
effort to avoid publication of the

' cutback studies because of their

controversial nature, Freeman’
answered that the University had
made no such decision.

“It was mostly a question of the
futility of publicizing,” Freeman
said. ,“To get into a broad
discussion of the specifics would be
a futile effort.” '

According to Freeman, cutbacks
were made after a series of
meetings with department heads
aimed at reducing expenditures by"
9.5% as a “planning exercise.”

After more deliberation, a--ﬁnal
figure of $3.1 million was gener-
ated, substantially lower than the
$8.9 million cutback target. _

‘ Pitt Campus

tFollo,wing Population Dirapit

BY KEN GORMLEY

Crime on the Pitt campus took a
nose dive in recent weeks,
according to Campus Police Chief
Curt Graham, as nearly 30,000
students returned ‘home for the
summer months. 

Graham said the lower rate
reported on the’ campus and in
surrounding parts of Oakland
during late April and early May
followed a trend established in
previous summers.

“The crime rate usually de-
creases drastically during the
summer months,” Graham pointed
out. This summer, he said, would
probably be no exception. .

With the exodus of thousands of
students,_and with only 180 people
living in the dorms, criminals have
fewer potential victims as well as
fewer opportunities to commit
thefts and robberies, which tend to
be the most frequently committed
crimes on the campus, Graham
said.’ ‘

The and

incidents of theft

robbery in Oakland, Graham.

predicted, will now shift from
inside to outside the Pitt campus.
I ‘.‘As the weather becomes nicer
and the number of- students in
Oakland drops, the emphasis of
crime changes to outside the
University,” he said.

Bicycle thefts and other crimes
begin to soar in Oakland, while
robberies and thefts on the campus
begin to decline. ' - ~ ‘

that we could cutback 9.5%,’?
Freeman explained. “It was
simply a planning thing.”

In response to speciﬁc questions .. 

over the nature of a $1 million’
contingency fund‘ slated for the

’75-’76 Pitt budget, Freeman said it "

was. used as a hedge against,
enrollment short-falls and unex-Vi
pected expenditures.

Asked why it had been increased 4 
from last .year’s $600,000, and if r

the University was planning for a .
drop in enrollment after a tuition
increase, Freeman said most
institutions had much higher
contingency funds, and that it was
a simple case of financial prudence. '
“Even if we had a tuition

roll-back, I’d have that $1 million in - 

there,” Freeman said. .5‘Enroll-'

ment is determined by many

economic factors outside of the . Q

University. ’ ’ .
Freeman said the University plan
for the cutbacks was made in thg

“interests of sanity,” and that the ‘-_ , M
series of negotiations with depart-. ~
ment heads was aimed at making a .;f_ ,

fair assessment of the needs and

financial ﬂexibility of University

programs.

“Usually the easiest thing to do _i 

is the meat-ax: across-the-board
cuts for-everyone. The meat-ax is

easier because no one can
complain.” _
Freeman, in response to 4a

Crime Dawn 

Graham estimated that-, just as in

the fall and winter months, only 
two of every ten people arrested by ' t ‘
the Campus Police are in any way; i ~

associated with the University.

Despite the drastic decrease in’ ' I

crime expected during the months
before the fall term, the -Campus

Police Chief has planned only a’ 

slight reduction of police coverage‘
for the campus. - 9

He said any cutback of policemen '

on and around the University would

result only from the usual summer ‘

vacations taken by many officers.

Major medical coverage starts

The three major differences
between the Higham, Neilson and
the Blue Cross plans, according to
Student Health Service Director
Joanne Robinson, are the increase
in major medical, coverage for
illnesses diagnosed before the
policy becomes active, and a
reduction to a $50 deductible
policy.

“Under -the Blue Cross plan, if
you have expenses above those
covered by the basic protection
plan, you pay the $50 only once per
year, even if you incur costs more
than once,” Robinson said.

‘ “Under the other plan, you would

have to pay $50 for each incident.”
Robinson said a clause in the

Cross plan makes no- such
exception.

The student health insurance

plan includes an option for students

who wish to receive treatment at
the Student Health Center but are
covered under another insurance
plan. —Cost of this plan would be
$52.80 under BlueCross and_ $30
under Higham, Neilson. Last year
this service cost $36.

Health and Well-Being

The University has begun to slash funds left and right from student
progranstoadjusttoatigit budget. The latestcut hascome fromthe -

E ' Student Health Service.

Health care on weekends no longer will be offered under the new

Students will be forced to use Presbyterian Hospital’s

emergency room. They are left with seriously inadequate service; ﬁrst,
because they will not be able to be treated at reduced rates; and
second, because only the most serious emergencies will be attended.

_ Oirrently, students can receive low—cost treatment on weekends at
the Center for afflictions ranging from allergies to broken bones.
When the weekend service is dropped, however, students will be

P . ‘ forced to take their turns in the emergency room behind higher-priority
"  cases. This naturally will entail hours of urmecessary waiting, which
1;‘ often can be more painful than the maladies themselves. Students will
‘ therefore be discouraged from seeking treatment.

- -In the words of Vice-Chancellor of Student Affairs Alfred Moye,

L E “We’ve just got to do without the niceties.” If the administration

considers treatment for illness one of life’s niceties, then students can

 . expect other important services likewise to be declared non-essential.

The cutback of weekend health service is a two—point issue, involving
both the physical well-being of students and their standard of living at

Pitt.

 From this move, students obviously can see where the‘
 - administration’s ﬁnancial concerns lie.
 .  ‘University is faced with receiving less money, and unless a clear list of ‘

Each department in the

j priorities is agreed upon, campus life soon may be very different from

\

Cutting the weekend health service is not like ﬁring a ﬁle clerk or
placing a hiring ceiling on librarians. Though it has been contended

, . that few students are treated on weekends, the chances for accidents

' . -_ are signiﬁcantly higher then because of parties and outdoor activities.
 ‘Sundays are also a problem since most drug stores are closed, and

A‘ students who could treat themselves do not have access to medicinal
preparations.

Students and University ofﬁcials obviously will disagree at times on
what should and should not be cut. What one considers a ,nicety,
another considers a necessity. It would be a. hypocritical policy to
expect students to exhibit self-reliance and independence when their

opinions are not taken into consideration by administrators making

 _ ﬁnancial adjustments. p

Letters to

Student Denied
Educational Trip

,When a student registers, and
pays tuition for a course offered by
the University, two assumptions
,are made: (1) An instructor will
present course material, and will

:_ ’ advise the student of requirements
' of the course. (2) The student will

attend the class during the

 . scheduled period, and will meet the
 assigned requirements of the

course. These are basic, reason-
able assumptions, but there are
some exceptions.

I am an MPH candidate in the

V Graduate School of Public Health.

Because my major interest. is
Occupational Health Nursing, I
selected 0ccH. 218. This course,
dealing with occupational health
and safety, consists of lectures in

 occupational diseases, and field

trips to various companies which
demonstrate health hazards in the
work environment. The first

H lecture dealt with Industrial Dis-

eases of the Respiratory Tract. The
first field trip dealt with coal
mining at Gateway Mine in
Waynesburg, Pennsylvania. I
attended the first lecture, but was
informed by the Course Organizer

that I would not be permitted to
take the field trip to Gateway Mine.
The reason given was that because
of superstition, no women would be
permitted to enter the mine. I am
the only woman in the class.

Those of us who practice in the
field of Occupational Health
Nursing have long been aware of
the importance of being well
informed abouthazards in the work
environment not only to prevent
occupational injury and illness, but
also to maintain the health of the
worker on the job.

The problem of respiratory
diseases in industry is a serious
one. The cause of one occupational
respiratory disease, -coal workers
pneumoconiosis, which affects
thousands, is clearly demonstrated
by observing coal mining in
operation. The student who is
denied this very important obser-

vation, for whatever reason, is at a

disadvantage compared with other
students in the same course.

The University of Pittsburgh is
located in a coal mining district.
Surely the Graduate School of
Public Health has within its
resources other coal mining faci-
lities which do not restrict entrance
to a coal mine to men only. Indeed,

Unavoidable

  Control in a Complex Society

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

Totalitarianism may be the
ultimate end in our culture. It
seems unavoidable given the
increasing complexity of various
areas of society, from economic to
political.

As societv becomes more depen-
dent on sophisticated networks of
committees and coordinating
bodies, and as pure population
figures increase the stress on the
need for efficiency in social
operation, the individual may
become more restricted.

Population increase is a given
fact.
fact. Therefore control and
coordination of economic sectors to
support our standard of living at its
present artiﬁcial level has become
a growing necessity.

Ultimately, control will become a
critical function of federal govern-
ment--and threats to that control
will step beyond mere philosophi-
cal frameworks--but will threaten
the existence of the culture itself.

Even now, "political choices
cannot differ in the amount of

Limited resource is a given *

. needs of

‘ control. but simply in the form.

Traditional laissez-faire will result
in control through vast trusts and
syndicates; businesses will manage
for their own survival.
Communism will simply institute
federal planning agencies for
cultural coordination and control.
The crucial point will be reached
when management of resources for
the increased population is forded
into super-management. The
allocation of decreasing resources
for an increasing population base
will become the absolute. necessity
of all political structures. The
scope of this management will have
to‘be vast, intricate and absolute if
the present society is to survive.
The individual as a social factor
or concept will suffer, perhaps will
be extinguished.
individuals must rest
when they cross the demands of
managing a perilous balance of
resource flow to populations far
above a‘ comfortable supply and
demand situation. .
Perhaps the withering of the
individual will come far in the
future. But the ﬁrst approximation

Decline and fall of activism

Certainly the ,

says that large societies such as the
United States and Russia will suffer
ﬁrst because of their unrealistic
living standards.

Are we willing to sacriﬁce the
cultural concept of the “indivi-

dual" in order to establish,‘/‘\_...z

balanced economic picture at
present social expectations?

Given the hard truth that there
will be population increases far
beyond the present capability of
the socio-economic structure to
support, we are offered the choice
between population control and
social control. _

But time and distance aie
comforts. .The expectations of the
present--the car, the air-condi-
tioner the gasoline, the tradition of
the unlimited family unit--all-may
build an inescapable momentum
toward the death of the “individual
concept."

An important question. To
maintain the concept will require a

revolution of perceptions. The
moral troubles facing our society
will be dealt with eventually, either

« by us or for us.

In the Wake of Kent State

BY PETE BUTCH

Sunday, May 4, was the ﬁfth
anniversary of the National Guard
victory in the Battle of Blanket Hill,
Kent State University. When the
Guard ﬁred from the hill, at
students'250 feet away, the results
were history--four dead, nine
wounded. '

the Editor

women are now employed -full-time . ’

in below ground mining operations
in .the area. I urge those in
Occupational Health at the Grad-
uate School of Public Health to take

the necessary steps to provide the

important coal mining ﬁeld for ALL
students who are registered for the
OccH. 218 course. Education is the
basis for informed judgment, and
without informed judgment there
cannot be proper understanding.

Reader Questions
‘Humanitarianism’

The good deserter and the bad ,

deserter.
For the American people, the
most obvious consequence of the

fall of South Vietnam is the arrival .

of more than 120,000 refugees.
Now, this situation brings a

paradox in the policy of the present ’

US government into light. For,
among the. Vietnamese refugees
recently arrived to the United
States, newsmen have pointed out
the presence of a large number of
soldiers who deserted their army‘
before the end of the ﬁghting. Like
other refugees, these deserters
have been welcomed in this country
and President Ford is currently
requesting additional funds from
the Congress to help them settle
down. At the same time however,
US citizens who objected to the
Vietnam war and refused to serve
cannot come back to their own
country and are compelled to live
abroad, in exile.

Shouldn't the absurdity of this
contradiction induce us to question
President Ford's “humanitarian.-
ism" and to look for the real
motives behind this action, which

seems to rely more on propaganda‘

reasons than on areal care for

suffering people. After all, for the ‘

last 10 years, nobody has ever

heard a US President expressing

concern for the people impr-isoned
[..in. tiger cages by Thieu's police!

 

, _,.lainil Salnii  .

The incident was devastating to
student activism across the nation,
after the initial furor wore off.
Protest rally were held, but never

with as much zeal as before. As the.

Kent State generation graduated, it
was replaced by increasingly
apathetic students.

'Lar_ge-scaleactivism received its
coup de grace after the infamous
1971 peace march on Washington
was followed by mass arrests.
Innocent bystanders were arrested
also, as police made their move
during the morning, rush hour.

That incident, along with the
ending of the Vietnam War (as far
as Americans were concerned), left
students with little desire or reason
to protest. Sure, a corrupt
president was in power, but
everyone seemedvto turn a deaf ear
to students’ words about him. He
was somewhat isolated at 1600
Pennsylvania Avenue.

It took hounding by the news

- media and then by Congress to get

rid of him, and even today some
Americans aren’t quite sure that
he, Richard Nixon, was all that
bad.

The Pitt branch of the Students
for a Democratic Society folded
early last fall. Students participa-
ting in last March’s Boston March
against Racism were dismally few
for a campus this size. The campus
is typically apathetic.

Each year brought fewer editor-
ials and features in newspapers
marking the anniversary of Kent

. State. Although overshadowed this

year by the fall of Saigon, the
ultimate irony was the mention of
Kent State in a Pittsburgh Press
feature, found daily on page two,

The Best Seat in Baseball, But You
Have to Stand!: The Game as
Umpires See It.

By Lee Gutkind, Dial Press, 209
Pages:$7.95.

Rarely do newspaper sports-
writers portray the Great American
Pastime as it really is, underneath.
Occasionally, one will be especially
critical of a favorite player. But in
the long run, the sports pages do
more to promote‘ the glimmering
side of baseball than the best team
of PR men the Major Leagues could

‘buy.

 But in a new ‘book by Lee
Gutkind, an assistant professor of
writing at Pitt, another side of
baseball is shown, not as shiny as
in the newspapers, but. a million
times more honest. In the summer
of '1974, Gutkind traveled the
baseball circuit with many um-
pires, mostly the crew of ‘Harry
Wendelstedt, Doug Harvey, Art.
Williams and Nick Colosi. In The
Best Seat in Baseball, But You
Have to.Stand! we see a part of
baseball never before so artfully
drawn--the world of the hated men
in blue. And through the umpires’
eyes, we see the game as it really
must be. 0 _
We see the pride of Wendel-
_s_t_edt, stung by a line-drive. that
tells him not to show pain on his

I, face for the players to see, the

_ players who would so gleefully take
advantage if they knew.

We see the (racist) joking

expressed in the reiaxed banter of.

the umpires’ locker room:
Wendelstedt says about Williams,
the sole black umpire in the Major

'4. ', 4r’“"Leagues, “I always ‘know when

x‘

   

he’s around. Everytime he walks
into a room, it gets spooky.”p

We see the afterhour enjoyments
of umpires in unfamiliar cities: the
taxi rides of the comical Chicago
cab driver Willie Rooks, who
company of one cab and one driver
is the personal chauffeur for all the
National League umps when
they’re in town.

We see the sadness in the
umpire’s' heart, the melancholy of a
‘man who must be away from home
and family for seven months of the

year, sprinting from city__to city

every four days.

We see the struggle inside
Williams, who is labeled by many
as a token black, to break himself of
the sterotyp_ical mold, and practice '

and work and work, to_ become a

 
  
 
   

man worthy of the umpire’s
uniform.

We see umpires in a motel room,
getting soaked with whiskey,
berating umpires who are not
strong, full of guts, mean as .a
crocodile, unfriendly to players,
and disliked by all, as they feel
umpires should be.

Finally, in a variety of ways, we
see how umpires feel about the
men they judge. We see that most
stay away from the players, avoid
them at all costs. And of course,
there is the now famous

against three Pittsburgh Pirates:
'”“Bruce Kison is the dumbest
player in the major leagues,” says
one, and. Wendlestedt claims:
“Hebner and Brett are quarter-
wits...Put them together and all
-you’ve got is a half-wit.”

. claim absolute ‘objectivity, since I

am both a friend and a former
student of Gutkind’s, the author.

But having been through his
course, “The New journalism,”
and having read much of the new
journalism myself, from Hunter
Thompson and his “Gonzo,” to
Gay Talese and his skillful prose, I
believe this book has been
completely successful. It works.

The new journalism applies ﬁc-
tional techniques in the writing
style to factual situations. In The
Best Seat in Baseball, we are riding
along with Gutkind and the
We are in
their locker rooms, their taxi
cabs; their own homes. We feel it.

In a sense, the new journalism
offers the best of both worlds. The
reporter has an opportunity to write

creatively. There is, I feel, a great '

need for this kind of reporting in all
areas if we are to achieve a
meaningful portrayal of our soci-
ety. Jimmy Breslin, in How the

Good Guys Finally Won, gives us,

aninside look at Congress during
“the impeachment summer.”
There should be more yet to come.

Gutkind undoubtedly will use the
new book in his course. And he
should. Not only is the writing
style‘ clear and concise, which
makes for good instruction, but the
effort at reporting is superb as
well. Students should learn how
Gutkind obtained his information

' and how he used what he did to tell

the story. One issue has already
been raised by in the local media.

Gutkind, in the author’s note,
explains he pretended to be drunk
and asleep in order to hear some
particularly interesting conversa-
tions. ‘Well, should a reporter be
doing this type of thing? That’s a
long story, and something well
worth talking about in class.

In case you weren’t one of the
lucky few who wound their way up
Cardiac Hill a week ago, here is a
sample of the action at the ﬁfth
annual Pitt Invitational track
classic. Called by Head Track
Coach Jim Banner the best ever,
the event certainly fulﬁlled all
expectation. Even the weather
cooperated for the event--bright,
sunny weather added to the
excellent timesvrecorded by the
runners on the fast Tartan track.

The only bad part about the
whole affair was the attendance.
As usual, only a few thousand
spectators showed up to see some
of the top track athletes in the East
do battle. People in Pittsburgh
must associate track with the
plague, because meets never get
the attention they deserve.
Herewith, fellow Pittsburghers, are
some scenes you missed.

The Mind Is Willing,
And the Body’s Trying

STATE COLLEGE AP--Penn
State professor John Lucas, who
has logged 50,000 miles of running
for fun, also has won ﬁve Olympic
Gold medals--but only in his mind.

He’s attended five Olympic
contests but he’s never been in the
starting blocks with the greats and
near-greats.

Instead, he runs on the Olympic-

track early in the morning with only
an occasional grounds-keeper look-
ing on.

“I won the 10,000-meter gold
medal in my mind each time,”
Lucas said. “Sometimes it’s
healthy to delude oneself.”

After 33 years of huffing and
puffing, the physical education
teacher logged his 50,000th mile
Sunday, and he says it’s full steam
ahead to 50,001.

“I enjoy it mentally and
physically,” he said. ., “There’s
nothing more relaxing than trotting
deep into the lush, green, cool
woods.”

In 1951 he graduated from

Boston University after serving as
captain of the cross country team.
In 1952, he ran 2,360 miles, his top
mileage in one year while training
for the Olympics he never made.

To pass the 50,000 mark, Lucas
set out with 21 colleagues to run
over the top of Tussey Mountain,
which is a 30-degree climb for four
miles to the top and a gentle slope
downward for the remaining eight
miles.

When he’s not trotting through
the woods or out on the highway
dodging trucks and cars, which he
refers to as the “enemy,” Lucas
glides around the indoor track at
the University.

-“That’s where I’m at my creative
best,” he said. “That’s where I
think about an upcoming seminar
or how to handle a problem at home
or at work. - '

“Frequently when I finish my
run the answer to my problem is
self-‘evident. There’s a connection
between the body feeling alert and
alive and the mind feeling the same
way.”

Navy Shooting
for Recruits
  At Indy 500!

BY BRUCE LOWITT
AP Sports Writer‘

INDIANAPOLIS AP--Try to
imagine a battleship or a destroyer
cruising around the Indianapolis
Motor Speedway. .

Pretty far-fetched, granted.
Nevertheless, the United States
Navy has moved some pretty» heavy
artillery into the famed brickyard
for next Sunday’s Indy 500. And
the big guns are aimed right at the
crowd that will pack the stands and
the infield.

It’s not a hostile action, though.
Just a novel bit of recruiting,
compliments of the Dayton-Wal-
ther Corp., which has two of the
‘cars entered for the classic race.

A After all, if a prune company, a
sauerkraut company, a drugstore
chain, a radio station, a motor
home ﬁrm and other such diverse
sponsors can sell their wares by
painting their names on the sides of
the sleek racing machines, why not
the Navy?

“Why not, indeed?” said John
Burlage, a chief journalist witht the
Navy. “The people who come
here, mostly the teenagers and
young men, are the kind of people
interested in the kinds of things
we’re interested in.”'

The unique association between
the Navy and the Ohio steel ﬁrm

“just sort, of evolved,” said Lt.
Michael Fitzgerald, an Indianapolis
recruiting information ofﬁcer. “No
body really knows who made the
first move. But Dayton-Walther
got involved--now I don’t want this
to sound like a lot of ﬂag
waving--because it wanted to do
something with a patriotic theme.”

The program, Fitzgerald says,
has been a major success. “It’s
opened doors for us that used to be
closed. And it’s been a deﬁnite
factor in additional enlistments.”

And so, with a recuiting station
that shows racing ﬁlms, with
buttons and caps and decals and
most notable, “Go Navy” stickers
afﬁxed to a Dayton-Walther Special
to be driven by Salt Walther and
Bob Harkey, the Navy is driving
home its point.

MIKE MATTER, although only a frosh, has everyone talking about

Tri’s Serving Up Wins    

As Individuals Sparkle  

BY DREW PORVAZNIK

The Triangles have won some
tough matches thus far. Two of the
past ﬁve matches were clinched in
overtime. There also was a
one-point victory over Indiana in
the season’s opener.

But all that has changed. This
time the Tri’s breezed to victory,
26-20, over the Boston Lobsters‘
under the Civic. Arena’s opened
roof. Their record is now 4-2.

This match was quite different
than the last one the Tri’s played
against Boston. Boston narrowly
lost the May 3 Super Tie Breaker
by only one point. This time
Boston came nowhere near the
speed and ﬂexibility they displayed
in the earlier match.

The Tri’s Evonne Goolagong led
the team to victory, winning both
the singles and the doubles events.

The only set the Tri’s lost was in
men’s singles, when Bob Hewitt
blasted Vitas Gerulaitis 6-2. In
fact, Hewitt was the only Boston
player who performed exception-

ally well. He played quickly and
had the ﬂexiibility needed to

outmaneuver Gerulaitis on the
returns. Serving was Hewitt’s only
liability; he double faulted three
times.

In women’s doubles, Goolagong
and Peggy Michel got off to a slow
start, losing the first two games.
but sufﬁciently improved to clinch
ﬁve games in a row. They won the
set 6-3 against Wendy.Trunbull
and Kerry"Melville, who got her
first start against the Tri’s. She

ﬁnished eighth league-wide among
singles players last year.

Goolagong went on to defeat
iMelville 6-4 in singles.

In men’s doubles, Gerulaitis and
Mark Cox defeated Hewitt and Ion
Tiriac, the player-coach from
Transylvania, 6-4. Cox displayed a
powerful serve in his home debut.
Tiriac and Hewitt played hard but
lost the last game, giving the Tri’s
the set. They also had to cope with
a hurricane of catcalls from the
audience (Werewolf (Tiriac) and
Kojak (Hewitt)). last time, Tiriac
and Hewitt crushed Gerulaitis and
Kim Warwick, 6-4.

Warwick and Michel easily won
the ﬁnal mixed doubles set, 6-3,
against Tiriac and Turnbull. The
set was marked by plenty of spiking
and a few aces by Warwick. Tiriac
was a paradox. He played either

- very quickly or very slowly, varying

game to’ game. He also
demonstrated the “Transylvanian
Twist” as he returned a spike by
Warwick using the backhand and a
great deal of versatility.

The Lobsters are now an
embarassing 0-7. Needless to say,
Tiriac refused to talk with reporters
after the match.

In other news, the Tri’s soon will
feel the wrath of John Newcombe.
The Hawaii Leis recently acquired
him from the now defunct Houston
EZ Riders.

Cox favors bringing in cheer-
leaders to the matches to jazz
things up a bit.

Lastly, the Tri’s now offer
student rates for the matches. The
tickets, with an ID required, are
$1.50.

scenes in the play in which Allison
‘/‘returns to reconcile with Jimmy
7 Porter, a painful act of submission,
V-fyet a culmination of strength.

- ~Mennen waves around an unlit

‘table. The actors talk about the
‘play, about the set, but mostly
I about their feelings, not as actors,

 I The rehearsal in theatre is a
 delicate tension; everything is

 From the darkness of the
 theatre, Mennen’s voice ﬂoats out
xfto advise Young about her
 inferpretation of Allison's return
after a retreat from Jimmy Porter’s
(bitterness, and of her confrontation
yvith Helena, his new lover.

Q-

  ehind ‘Angry’ Scenes

The attention to‘ detail is
staggering.

“All I can see from the front row
is your elbows,” someone told
Young. A stage chair blocked the
view of a table behind it. “The real
chair is shorter than this one,”
Mennen said. .

“Well, people in the front row
might not be able to see her,” was
the reply.

“We won't sell the first row,”
Mennen suggested.

“People will insist we have to
sell them. There’s one lady who
always sits front row center no
matter what.”

Mennen paused in silence; they
probably will move that chair, and
that stubborn lady in the front row
will be ensured of seeing all of Kate
Young as Allison.

 

John E. Angle, president of the
Pittsburgh Symphony Society has
announced that the Board of
Directors of the Symphony Society
ratiﬁed a three-year agreement
appointing Andre Previn as Music
Director, beginning with the
1976-1977 season, thus ending the
search to fill the post.

Previn, who will retain his post
as Principal Conductor of the
London Symphony Orchestra, suc-
ceeds William Steinberg, whose
resignation to become Music
Director Emeritus at the end of the
1975-1976 season was announced
previously.
