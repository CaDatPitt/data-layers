  Posvar Outlines Plcmsfor Pitt-Peking ExchcmgeProgram

By SUE McFARLAND

Pitt News Staff Writer
Chancellor Posvar outlined a
proposed cultural and- academic

..exchange of faculty and students

“between Pitt and the People’s
Republic of China at Monday’s
University Senate Council meeting.

The program calls for an as-of-yet
undetermined number of Chinese
students to beconditionally admit-
ted to Pitt with the stipulation that
they must successfully complete
one semester of academic work

before they can continue. Students t

requiring English language tutor-
ing would be required to undertake
an intensive study of the language
before enrolling in any regular
coursework. The program would be

funded entirely by the People’s_

Republic of China.

4} Student Government Board

member Bernie Popko posed an
inquiry as to the number of Pitt
students, if any, who would. be sent
to China.
“We have proposed that we send
‘ some faculty and some students to
China but they are in no way
prepared to handle a large number
of students,” Posvar said,“‘They

are sending us students because '

WPGH Radio: SeekingA

their educational system has -been
demolished as a result of a great
cultural revolution.”

The possibility of such an
exchange program surfaced earlier
this year when Posvar, along with

other Pitt administrators and.
faculty, visited China. Later this_

month, the presidents of Chinese

colleges and universities will’

reciprocate by.making a twelve-stop

— tour of the U.S. that will include a

day in Pittsburgh. .
Posvar expressed the hope’ that

such a visit will foster positive

feelings toward further exchanges

of ideas between the two nations.

A The Chancellor remarked on the

general increase in the number of

‘foreign students enrolled at Pitt. At

the beginning of the fall term there
were 1,100 foreign students repres-
enting 93 countries enrolled in

undergraduate and graduate pro-'
- grams.

“The number of foreign students
at the University really is growing, ’ ’
Posvar said. “This is important in
helping toenrich the University as a

cosmopolitan institution as well as

helping‘ affect the demographic
trends.” -
In other business before the

council, Posvar commented on his
recent trip to Harrisburg to testify in
the State budget hearings. In his
appearance at the hearings, Posvar
voiced his budgetary ‘ ‘wish’ ’ for the
upcoming ﬁscal year, which in-
cludes a request for $75 million in
state appropriations. This request
shows an increase of $12 million
over last year. '

“I really believe that this is a
justified request, but_I would be
happy with any major fraction of
this,” Posvar said.

The Chancellor made- his'predic-
tions for the coming year and the
annual debate over funding for
Pennsylvania’s state related uni-
versities. ‘

“In reality_I will have to say that
we can expect worse than what we
hoped for, ” Posvar said, ‘ ‘but all we
can do at this point is wait and see
what the new administration comes
up with for us.”

Posvar also expressed concern
over what effect the termination of
the State Senatorial Scholarship
program will have on Pitt’s budget.

“There was a lot of wrongly
placed public pressure put on the
state universities over the scholar-

Popular Press Mixes Fact

By MATT FRASER

‘ ‘CLONE ELECTED
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES OF AMERICA! ”

This particular heading
hasn’t' appeared yet in any
literature, but there are some
other outrageous recent state-
ments‘ about cloning ‘almost as
absurd. Not too longago, the
National’Star and other scandal
sheets, put out some garbage
about Elvis beingcloned.

Most of the new science
ﬁction movies have a token
clone or two in them. U.F.O.
magazine will try to convince‘
you that clones are, at this very
moment, inﬁltrating the gov-
ernment and planning to
destroy mankind. And, even
Penthouse had an interview
with some man who wrote a
“true book” on ‘a real live
cloning.

So what is all this hoopla?
What is cloning, anyway?

Cloning ‘is “the technique of
developing. . . genetically iden-
tical cells or organisms”
according to Anna Pai’s
“Foundations of Genetics” (A
book with which many‘ Pitt
students‘ are familiar). In other
words, it's the process .of
creating (either naturally or
artiﬁcially) identical twins.

That’s all it is. It is not
genetic engineering because no
chromosomes are altered, only‘
duplicated. Every cell in the
human body is a clone ‘of the
original‘ egg cell that was its
beginning. I

Every time a single cell
divides, the two daughter cells
are clones. This is the basis of
reproduction in single-celled
organisms, ‘and the way of
growth for multicellar organ-

isms. The cloning that is being,

talked about in the media is the
production of multicellular
identical twins.

To carry out this process, an
unfertilized egg cell must first
be collected. Then a‘ body cell
with a nucleus bearing the full
compliment of chromosomes is
selected. The egg’s nucleus is
removed via microsurgery and
is replaced with the body cell’s

nucleus. The whole process
produces a fertilized egg
without the sperm and egg
courtship.

This egg now has the same
genesas the donor‘ of the body
cell, and‘ (barring mutations
that sometimes occur when
cells divide) the fully-
developed organism is an
identical twin of the donor’.

This has only‘ successfully
been done with lower animals,
like "frogs and 'salamanders. It
has never been ‘done’ with
mammals. Amphibian eggs are
much larger and more respon-
sive to stimulation than mam-
malian ‘eggs,-, and‘ are thus
easier to work with.

This is not‘ to say that cloning
of mammals is not‘ possible. It
should work; it does in theory.
How would a biologist clone ‘a
mammal? He would follow the
same game plan as with the
frogs, but mammalian eggs
need to develop inside a womb.
One ‘must im lant ‘the devel-
oping‘ individual in ‘a foster
mother’s uterus.

This is done all the time with
lab animals (mouse embryos
stored for months in a deep
freeze were successfully reim-
planted and‘ developed nor-
mally)- The famed test tube
baby was placed in ‘the
mother’s womb this way. Once
this is done,‘ the embryo is on
its way to its -ﬁrst birthday.

Natural identical twins ‘are

natural clones. People see big.

visions ‘of rows and’ rows of
carbon-copied people when

-they think about cloning.

Anyone who knows a set of
twins knows they are not
carbon copies of each other.
This would be the same for
artificial twins (clonesl).
Genetics is only a part of the
whole person. Environment is
important throughout" the in-
dividual’s life, from prenatal
nutrition to adult dreaming.
For a clone to be exactly the
same as the donor, the clone
would have had to‘ have the
exact same environment as the
donor, during its entire devel-

opment, and that is impossible.

Human ‘clones would not

come poppingout of artiﬁcial .

wombs fully mature after two
weeks of development, ‘talking
ﬂuently and ‘having ‘the same
memories as the donor. They
would not‘ all have a psychic
link. However, movies such as
“The Clone ‘ Masters” would
have people believe so.

The book that was of primary
importance in the incorporation
of the word “cloning” into‘ the
“household word” "category
was “In ‘His Image: The
Cloning ‘of a Man,” by David
Rorvik, who writes a sup-
posedly true story of a

' millionaire who secretly had

himself cloned.

In; a Penthouse interview,
Rorvik said that in 1970 he had
told a reporter that he planned
to do a novel about cloning,’ and
critics of his book believe it is

‘ exactly that—a novel.

The American Association
for the Advancement of Science
published an article by Barbara
Culliton in the June '16, 1978
issue of Science entitled:
“Cloning Caper Makes it to the
Halls of Congress.” The article
pointsout that Rorvik had said.
in his Penthouse interview that
he would welcome a congres-
sional investigation of his
claim. When one ‘ was held,
Rorvik didn’t‘show, but made
arrangements‘ with the ‘com-
mittee for a later date, an
engagement ‘ that’ also was
broken by him.

In his book, Rorvik states
that the cloner worked with red
blood cells as donor cells for
nuclei. He must have over-
looked the fact that red blood
cells have no ‘nuclei (they are
the only‘ cells of the body
without them).

He also states that the
cloning process was carried out

by cellular fusion. ‘Cellular '

fusion (the joining of two cells)
is possible, but if a supposedly
nucleated body cell is fused
with an haploid (having half the
normal number of chromo-
somes) egg cell, the resulting
cell would be triploid with
one-and-‘a-half times the nor-
mal number of chromosomes.
This would be all right’ if the
cells were from plants‘, but it
doesn’t ' work with mammals.

and Fiction on Cloning
“s

Proi. Pauli Doerder stresses cloninglot mammals can bring benefits to 4:.
science by reproducing Identical animals for experiments. Tweed photo "

L The cloner, who is supposed
to be an obstetrician, ‘seemed
to be confused about the
differences between a‘ zygote,
an embryo and ‘a fetus (any ‘real
obstetrician would know‘ this).
Andre Hellegers, professor of
obstetrics and (gynecology and
the director of the Kennedy
Institute of Ethics at George-
town University testiﬁed at the
congressional hearing’ that
“...one can conclude that this
is not a book about the cloning
of the son of Max (the
millionaire), but rather about
the cloning of David Rorvik, a

, functional illiterate in ethic
and med'l’tin‘e.‘”  ’

«allow infertile couples to have
children of their own, a twin of
one of the parents’. It could lead
to the development ‘of genet-

Dr. ‘Paul Doerder‘ of Pitt’s I
Department of Biological Sci-
ences points‘ out that cloning of
mammals would provide uni-
form genetic‘ strains ‘of labor-
atory animals (mice, rats, etc.)
for experimentation. Doerder
added that no one he knows is 4.3

image-conscious a university as ever will exist, would
have a thousand-watt ‘advertisement spread across
Allegheny County each day.

So improving WPGH.may make sense, but it is a
proposal that, until recently, hasn’t made much

progress. “Even the speech department hasn’t taken T

us seriously,” Couch said, “because we aren’t an
open-air station.” - 4 .
“.We’ve gone to them countless times asking for
help,” he said, “but they’ve tended to ignore us. If
your own speech department won’t ” take you
seriously, who can?”. in
The station, therefore, has been somewhat
stagnant for years. Butthe staff has invested time

and effort while reaping experience and, on occasion, ,

jobs.

Students go to—WPGH when interested in broad-
casting. The speech department, though strong on
rhetoric and theory, is weak in practical areas. So,

I

like writers who flee the English department and
work at The Pitt News, those ‘persons seeking radio
career need turn toward WPGH.

Herschel (back in Pittsburgh, at WDVE, after a

tour in New York City) made a name as a WYDD-

disc jockey after gaining training at WPGH.“ Chip
Hubbard, a KDKA producer, is a WPGH alumnus,
as are Tab Douglas of WYDD and Bob Mayo of
KQV. And a~pair of current WPGH employees,

- Lenore Williams and Gail German, also work full-

time for WTAE’s news department.

The talent is there; what is lacking, mainly, is a
license.. And that is the object of Couch’s current
quest. ‘ . _ , _

The station hired a Boston firm to scan the local
radio dial in search of a free FM ‘frequency. Two
were found (one belongs to ‘Carnegie-Mellon’s
station, which is expected to be forced from the air

by tightened federal regulations). The station is ob- '

taining a Federal Communications Commission ap-
plication, and-Couch said he believes there is a “50-

station has been silent for a week as station engineers . T

have .begun a month-long repair schedule.
“We have a place for the antenna, a top-flight

- production studio and a good studio,” Couch said. ’

“All weneed is a place on the dial.”

The University would be important in any move. to
secure a frequency. ' _
“Pitt would be very important in any dealings with

the FCC,” Couch said, .‘‘since we'll be the official 

Universityof Pittsburgh radio. ..if they support us.’,’
WPGH will apply for permission to broadcast
1,000 watts, which will reach most of Allegheny

County and which will more than satisfy-—and“
‘ reward——the students who work at Pitt’s, student

radio station. V

“They showed a great deal of
desire to get the bill passed,” said
Philadelphia District .Attorney Ed-

He said he plans to use the grand

would have an easier time
empaneling investigative grand
juries.

Prosecutors would merely have to
petition their county president

judge who would have to issue an
order within 10 days setting up the
grand jury.

Existing law requires the district
attorney to prove a pattern of
corruption that needs extraordinary
corrective steps.

With an investigative grand jury,
a district, attorney also gains
subpoena power, something he
ordinarily. doesn’t have.

. Before reaching agreement, the
committee debated for "nearly two
hours over amendments.

One, responsible for delaying
ﬁnal approval in the Senate before
the recess, would have .allowed’1O

nnnu""

percent of a county’s registered
voters to petition the district
attorney for a grand jury.

Senators said the provision was
too broadly written and could be
abused. As a result, the committee
decided to remove the amendment.

Despite personal pleas from
Rendell and Delaware County
District Attorney Frank-Hazel, the
committee decided to retain a

~ provision permitting defense law-

yers into‘ the grand ‘jury room.

Both Rendell and Hazel had
argued the provision would permit
defense attorneys to disrupt the
grand jury process.

s toflncreose Prosecutors’ Powers

“In your good faith attempt to
protect people's rights, it will be
used for venal, obstructionist
purposes, ’ ’ Rendell said.

‘ ‘If you get a counsel in there and
he sees it’s going bad for his client,
he will object to everyquestion, ’ ’ he
said.

He said defense attorneys used
such tactics to thwart a grand jury in
a sensitive judicial corruption case
in New York. '

In many 1 organized crime and
corruption cases, the attorney
representing the witness is really
acting on behalf of other clients,
said Hazel. -

Council Reports One Out of Three Women Lock JobSkiIIs

Iy'I'bAnnu'atedPress
’ WASHlNGl'0N—.An ‘estimated
26 million American ‘women--

, nearly one of every three—lack the

basic educational‘ and ’ job skills
needed to survive in ’today’s
society, a presidential advisory
council reputed yesterday.

The report saystheworst off are
“displaced homemakers,” women
who have ‘lost their spouses
because of death, desertion ‘or
divorce andare forced into’ the job
market.

They are so numerous and ‘their
problems so urgent ‘that they
constitute a “hidden sub-culture”
in American society, the council
said.

Many ' single mothers, women
over 60 and displaced homemakers
lack marketable job skills, con-
cludes the report, entitled “Neg-
lected Women.”

Many ‘of these women may be
good mothers and housekeepers,
but they are ignorant of such
economic realities as money

management, ‘credit, insurance and
banking, the report says.

“The common denominator for
all 26 million of these women is that
they are caught, because they are
women, in stereotypes,” the report
says. “They are the products of
past educational‘ and social pat-
terns that do not‘ apply to today's
reality.” 1 ‘

The report, written by the
National Advisory Council on
Women’s Educational Programs,
says these ‘disadvantaged women

need training ‘for well-payin _‘jobs
that offer advancement (impor-
tunities.

“Th'ey also need access to
ﬁnancial aid for tuition, child care,
transportation, clothing and, fre-
quently, living expenses,” the
report concludes.

The council recommend ‘legisla-

tion that would provide these
women with ﬁnancial assistance for
educational‘ programs, tax incen-

,tives—for career advancement

‘:i""’Senatorial scholarships, the $3.1 million patronage
' . package distributed by state senators to children of

friends, fundraisers, political drones and an oc-
casional deserving parent, are no more. Under in-
creasing journalistic scrutiny and fielding the wrath

 of a suddenly-waste conscious electorate, the
‘ .senators decided discretion had ‘a great deal to" do

w-, _.

_ it is, then the Senate has two options: send the j

with keeping their seats and abolished the program.’
The senators now have an opportunity to atone for
any past sins. The $3.1 million used for the scholar-
‘ships must now be reallocated. The money should
"continue to be used for educational purposes, and if

I . money to the state colleges and the state-related

K‘ .1

‘universities or give it directlyito the students. i
, ‘The former choice is one that the Senate should
debate for 30 seconds then unanimously reject. The

 sum is far too small to divide among Pennsylvania’s

_-many colleges and universities.

Furthermore, the

 ’ :Senate‘need not give administrators more money to
" J spend; they are kept busy enough spending the
" _ money we already give them. This position differs

from one taken in a previous editorial, for we believe

if . this next proposal to be a better idea.

The Senate’s best decision would be to-establish a I

scholarship fund that grants money to students based

on academic merit. If this were done, the new fund
would complement money distributed by the Pen-
nsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency. Ac-
cording to Student Government Board member Ber-
nie Popko, the Senate may be trying to repent of its

“'S1I1S. “"* "“" --
“It’s been put down on paper but never formally‘

acted upon,” Popko said recently. “Right now there

are no provisions anywhere in the Commonwealth

aid system for merit-—-only need. Four tenths of one «
percent of the aid allocated to Pitt is allocated on

* 'merit...over 99 percent is given out solely on the basis

of financial need.” - e T
The disparity is disturbing. In a time when
scholarships are awarded for athletic skills from
football to volleyball, academic grants also should be
given to gifted students. , Since individual universities

are'not willing to do their part, the state must now -

seize this opportunity to reward its bright students
and encourage them to remain in Pennsylvania to
study. Those students who are in need can get
PHEAA aid‘. ' Other worthy high school graduates
can receive merit aid.» (Security checks can be in-
stituted to “avoid double dipping.) This new fund
would allow certain ‘students, whose parents’ income
is above the PHEAA cutoff line, to have anotherway
of making college payments. , . . .
The mechanics could be easily worked out.’

PHEAA can control the newfund, or the money can
be given to another’ state education agency to
distribute. ‘High school seniors could be required to

take tests to initially discover who might be worthy of .
E thescholarships, and test results Eould then be mat-

ched withhigh school transcripts to determine the
recipients of any grants. ;

Popko introduced a resolution to the SGB last
week asking the General Assembly to transfer
senatorial scholarship funds to PHEAA. The SGB

Page 6—Wednesday, October 11, 1978

resolution, if passed, is well intentioned but not

_ enough. The SGB should instruct its Public and
Governmental Relations Committee to give priority

to this issue on its next trip to Harrisburg. That is as
far as student input can go.

What is really needed is a voice from Pitt’s ad-
ministration favoring the creation of a merit scholar-

ship fund with the $3.1 million. State senators do not

listen much to students; they listen a little more
carefully when university heads, trustees and'lob-
byists come knocking at the ‘door. The universities
can join together, much as they did a year ago when
state appropriations were delayed, and present a

, united front in support of the new scholarships.

The senators have proven they are incapable of
distributing scholarship money in the proper spirit of
education; It took a lot of pressure for the Senate to
relinquish itsnprized patronage gifts, but finally it

— buckled under to the heat. ‘It should not take as

much to get the Senate to approve the reallocation of
the' money into a merit_scholarship program, but
even if it does, the results will be well worth the

1 effort.»

"* Jumping to‘Conclusions

Jim P'ane’s article on the ’ ’ anemic
attendance’ ’ at Pirate baseball

S _ ,_ games seems to me an unfortunate

output for a university newspaper. I
suggest any journalist should be
careful in deciding that racial and
ethnic problems are important
ones. If this were the case, after
all, the Steelers would have as-
much or more of a problem than the
Pirates in selling seats. I would
make a few different suggestions:
The pattern of attendance at
sports events in urban centers

’ V requires that we look at subtle

evidence which is not immediately
obvious. The Univesrsitv esta-
blishment, e.g., believed that_the

building of an outstanding football
team at Pitt would immediately lead
to selling out all home games. This
led to a ﬁasco a few years ago when

‘ the administration ﬁrst cut down

the number of student seats on the
assumption those seats could be
sold at full price, then had to plead
with students to return to the games
when the seats could not be sold.
For reasons not completely clear,
big-time college football does not
ﬁll stadiums in the big cities.

Southern California, as strong a

team every year as one could hope

for, cannot fill its stadium in Los

Angeles, and no other city has

' anything even close to that.

I believe that most baseball teams

with new stadiums have done-

reasonably well on attendance, with
three or four prominent exceptions;
these are Oakland/San Francisco,
Atlanta and Pittsburgh. In the first
case, two teams are located too
close together, causing attendance
problems for‘ both. The unique
problem of Atlanta and Pittsburgh

seems to be the design of the
stadiums, a factor that may _not
always be uppermost in the minds
of spectators.

The Three Rivers design is quite

"unique, in that the placement of the

Allegheny Club led to placing the
upper deck five stories above the
lower deck; a height making it
difficult, almost impossible, to
follow the ball from the upper. deck.

The Post-Gazett’s sports editor has
agreed with me on this, although his
agreement amounted to only two

sentences in a single column—un-‘

derstandable, because local sports
editors cannot be too critical of the

local establishments in the cities in '

which they work. In any case, the
decline in attendance has been
rather steady since 1970, with
“babushka” promotions. and the
like providing only temporary
surges.

My suggestion could be easily
checked, though nobody has

bothered to do it. My guess is that”

the Pirates sell a disproportionately
low percentage of seats in the upper

deck. If this is so, the problem is in .

to colored baseballs, adding seats in

Get the Facts

In a recent article entitled
“ Retired General Singlaub Predicts
Return to Peacetime Draft,” (Oct.
2, 1978), Pitt News reporter Rodney

Griffith shows a distressing disre- ,
‘gard for minimal accuracy,

Presumably paraphrasing Singlaub
(whose simpleness of mind emerges
with great. clarity in the article),'
Griffith writes: “The retired major
general criticized Sen. George
McGovern’s recent statements,
which called for an invasion of
Cambodia to end repressive com-
munist rule there.” i .

Now, .a reporter is .. supposed-to

rcheck facts: ‘these are not even

attributed to the simple-minded

, major general. Sen. McGovern did -
but I
suggested United Nations interven- '

not call. for an invasion,
tion in "what appears to be a
particularly harsh mode of govern-
ing. Multi-lateral actionis not the
same as unilateral invasion, nor is

“communist” in necessary aposi-
tion to “repressive.” Singlaub may
well misundertand McGovern, but

it behooves a careful journalist to‘
set the record straight.
Griffith will be more careful in the
future.

First Draft

Putting on a show requires enormous effort by many
people. Sets need to be designed, constructed and painted.

‘Props must be found—scavenged from thrift shops and ﬂea

markets it unavailable in the company's storage room.

‘Costumes must be carefully created to match each charac-

ter. The lights must be set for ea§_l_1 scene and the sound
system must be tested and retested. And, of course, the ac-
tors must learn their lines.

All of the above is a major task even for professionals.
One misplaced prop or light can ruin an entire scene. One
inappropriate costume can mar the impression given by a
character. Managing all-this, to put it lightly, is a strain.

But Pitt students throw themselves into the production of a
play with vigor. Theater students put in long hours in the
workship building sets and costumes. The director and cast
spend weeks creating their image of the play. Turn to page
four to get a backstage view of Studio Theater as it prepares
for its next production, Edward Albee’s A Delicate Balance.

Sports are a fundamental part of American life, and most
people get lessons on competitiveness and the virtues of
winning early. Youngsters of eight or nine are sent onto the
playing fields to scrimmage their hearts out in Midget League
football or to play a strong nine innings in Little League
baseball. Defeat often weighs heavily on these young
athletes. For one view of children's sports and their effects,
read Nello Giorgetti’s essay on page six.

posed of many ethnic groups. A good place to start the sear-
ch for the essence of Pittsburgh and its people is Pitt's
Nationality Rooms, housed on the first ﬂoor of the Cathedral
of Learning. Each of these 18 rooms was designed by native
architects, and represents an important period or aspect of a
nation's history or culture.

In this issue, Fifth Ave focuses on the building of the
Cathedral of Learning itself. Never officially named, the 535-

foot tower dominates Oakland and the Pitt campus. lts .

Commons Room is one of the only examples of true gothic
architecture in the United States. No steel supports hold up
its walls and arches of solid limestone. The Cathedral came
into being through the persistence of Chancellor John
Bowman and over the objections of many: The story of the
Cathedral begins on page three, and is the first in_a series on
the Nationality Rooms.

A few new books have made it onto the University of Pit-
tsburgh bestsellerslist this week. Mid-terms are fast ap-
proaching, and though course work is piling high, this may be
a good time to check out the books for apres~test time. (No,
it's not an illusion. Most of these booksare more interesting
than the ones in many syllabi.) See page_seven.

The Gothic Cathedral That Almost Wasn’t

By Mary Jane McKeever

( This article, the first in a series
about Pitt's Nationality Rooms, deals
with the construction of the Cathedral
of Learning. The author is a
Nationality Rooms tour guide.)

The dedication of the Cathedral of
Learning in 1937 was the
culmination of 17 years of dedicated
work by one man: Chancellor John
G. Bowman. Bowman was a dynamic
man, a romantic man, perhaps even a
visionary one. He was almost single-
handedly responsible for creating a
great university in the industrial com-
munity of Pittsburgh.

The symbol of the University, the
Cathedral, stands 42 stories high and
is the tallest educational building in
the United States. It was constructed
from 1926 to 1937, during the Great
Depression.

Pitt was nothing more than a

series of low buildings clustered Ion
the hill around Alumni Hall when
Bowman became Chancelior in
January 1921. Many classes were
held in wooden shacks circa World
War I. The University was $2 million
in debt, and it was rumored that the
sheriff was about to foreclose. Worst
of all, no one seemed to care.

Bowman was director of the‘

American College of Surgeons when
he came to Pittsburgh to give a
speech‘ in October 1920. After-
wards, a few of the men preseent
asked Bowman to dine with them at

the Duquesne Club. George Clapp, a _

member of the University Board of
Trustees and head of the Pittsburgh
Testing Laboratories, asked Bowman
to become Pitt's Chancellor after that
dinner. A

The pressures of operating under
a $2 million debt did not faze
Bowman. At a dinner held to
welcome him, he astounded Pit-
tsburgh civic and University leaders
by ignoring their suggestion for
raising $100,000 to cover the in-
terest due on Pitt's loans. lnstead, he
placed the University’s financial
needs at $15 million. This caused
Richard B. Mellon to pull at Bowman's
coat to get him to stop talking.

Early in J Bowman's administration,
he calculated that the University
would need an additional 13 million
cubic feet of space. Richard Mellon
had told Bowman that to get
monetary support for Pitt, he would
need a dynamic plan. These two
thoughts were always with him: the
need for a plan and the need for more
space. ’

In his book Unofficial Notes,
Bowman wrote: “For some days I had
been asking myself if the un-
precedented need of the College
could not be turned into an un-
precedented advantage." Bowman

also realized Pittsburgh was a steel
town populated by hard workers, and
that he must somehow incorporate
this into his plan.

Just one block from the campus in
1921 was a plot of land known at
Frick -Acres. These 14 acres had

been the property of the late Henry
C. Frick, and were controlled by the
trustees of his estate.

This land in the heart of Pit-
tsburgh’s civic center

struck

Bowman's imagination. As he walked
across Frick Acres, he envisioned a
tower of education, a building that
through steel and stone would sym-

bolize all the great things of Pit- T

tsburgh.

Bowman soon
however, that the land was about to
be sold to developers who intended
to build the Schenley Apartments.
White stakes had already been put in
place to mark the building's foun-
dations. He frantically contacted the
realtor, who, due to Bowman's per-
sonality and persistence, held up the
signing of the deed.

Andrew Mellon, then Secretary of
the Treasury, Bowman reasoned,
was the only person who could im-
mediately grant the $3.5 million
necessary to purchase Frick Acres.

So for eight months, from April to

JOHN GABBERT BOWMAN

discovered, '

December 1921, Bowman travelled
by train to Mellon’s Washington D.C.
office at least once a week. With
each visit, Mellon’s resistance to
Bowman and his plan lessened. On-
evening in September, Mellon’s an-
swer to Bowman was yes.

“Late one afternoon in Septem-
ber, I went to the Secretary's office
to present a summary, if I could, of
the future of Pittsburgh and of the
University, the two being to me in-
separable,” Bowman recounted in

Unofficial Notes.

“l was keyed to
give all I had. Mr. Mellon walked back
and forth slowly along the south side
of his office. He said little. Once,
though, he interrupted me with a
statement that it seems I can still ‘

hear. ‘Wether or not anyone else
believes your stuff,’ he said, ‘no one
doubts but that you believe it.’

“The room grew almost dark. The
Secretary did not turn on the lights.
Hours had gone by as thought hey
were minutes. then Mr. Mellon
walked close to me, stopped, and
said in a low friendly tone, ‘I accepted
an invitation to dinner tonight. It is too
late not to go. My brother and I wil

-give the land. You are the most per-

sistent man I- have ever seen.’
“ ‘I'm sorry,’ I said, ‘about the din-
ner and about being so persistent.

 

But tell me. if l had not been per-
sistent, would you and your brother

_ have given the land?’

“ ‘No.’ he said."

Charles Klauder, a Philadelphian
and one of the foremost gothic ar-
chitects in the country, was hired by
Bowman to build his tower. There
was great opposition to the
Cathedral's construction. University

. Trustees thought the elevators would

always be jammed, and that the noise
would be intolerable.
claimed that a deep bed of quicksand
lay under the construction site.
Some said the wind would knock the
building down; others said the
Cathedral would destroy the dignity
of the civic center.

Through these discussions,
Bowman continued to consult with
Klauder. It was not always an easy
association. Bowman had made the
study of architecture his hobby, and
had a definite idea of how his building
should appear. Two years would
pass before Bowman and Klauder
concurred on the building's exterior
design. »

Agreement came one evening af-
ter Bowman had rejected yet another
of Klauder’s sketches. Klauder left
the room, then returned. The two
men went to eat dinner together. As
Bowman described the scene:

“After dinner we sat on the floor in
his living room, he with a drawing
board and some blank sheets of
paper. The man had exceptional
ability to draw freehand.

‘‘ ‘Is it something like this?’ he
would say.

“ ‘No, I'm sorry, that is not it.’

“ ‘Well, how would this do?’ he
would ask, making another sketch.

“After about three hours the floor
was pretty well covered with sket-
ches. We were both getting cross.
Then without a word Mr. Klauder
stood up, walked to a phonograph,
and put on a record. The record hap-
pened to be the Magic Fire music of
“The Valkyrie."

“The orchestra was filling the
room with sound. The music rose to
a climax until it seemed that it could
go no higher. -But it did go higher,
and higher again, and came to a
climax after climax. Was it possible
that the music could go on? The
music answered by going on. On and
on, the music finally rose to the burst
of the Magic Fire.

“ ‘One climax after another,’
I said. ‘That music is the building.
And it did not get its height, its

' meaning, its awful power by one leap.

It took many. Isn't each leap a but-
tress, a buttress on a tower?’
“We had been sitting on chairs
through the Magic Fire, but we went
to the floor again. Hours went by.

We were excited.

The Studio: ‘A Delicate Balance’ of Cast, Crew

 

By MARTHA GARVEY

when the curtain goes up on the
Pitt Studio Theater production of
Edward Albee’s ‘A Delicate Balance,
it will mark an end as well as a
beginning. For a month prior to the
play’s run,'the cast and crew have
been preparing the set, the
costumes and themselves with an
intense dedication. Martha Garvey
captures the spirit of this work in
the four interviews below.

THE DIRECTOR

He raised his hands like a
cheerleader starting a yell. “Energy!
Give me energy.”

Ron Wisniski, director of A
Delicate Balance, needs more than
energy. He needs large doses of
courage and a huge quantity of faith-
faith that he'll be able to audition and
to rehearse a difficult play in less than
a month’. Ron originally planned to do
a very different pIay—George Ber-
nard Shaw's Mrs. Warren's
Profession—— but it called for three
sets and 10 people-requirements
beyond the Studio's resources.

“Everyone says, ‘Oh, Ron, this is
too hard.‘ Well, they should be shot
for saying that,” Ron said. “Neil
Simon is hard, too. A Delicate Balan-
ce is a cluttered play, full of images.
We'll never get everything out of it
that we could, especially in a month,
but we'll try."

A Delicate Balance is a series of
homecomings. Agnes and Tobias
grudgingly welcome their best
friends, Edna and Harry, who have
fled their house because of a terrible,
unnamable fear. Julia, Agnes and
Tobias’s daughter, is running from the
disaster of her fourth marriage.
Agnes’s sister, Claire—“drunk, but
not an alcoho|ic”—sardonically com-
ments on it all. ‘

“Your original idea of any play is
always wrong," Ron said.
your actors come in, and they have
their own wrong ideas about the play.
Gradually, you reach your goal. The
right idea."

Although Ron is barely 21 , he has
been turning wrong ideas into right
ones for a long time. He starred inA
Funny Thing Happened on the Way
to the Forum and The Country Wife at
Pitt, and last year directed Lillian
Hellman’s The Little Foxes for Studio
Theater. For two years, he has been
the managing producer of the South
Park Conservatory Theater—which
he founded.

“When I first came to Pitt, the
theater people struck me as a very
closed group," he said. “Ycu;’re
taking a lot of risks——why not take
them with people you really trust?
Being a director is sometimes like
being a priest. To get at the poetic
prose of this play, you have to ex-
plore any way you can. I may have to
say, ‘Remember the time your mother
died?’ Actors confide in me, and l
have to respect that confidence.”

Beinga director is also like being a -

magician. Auditions forA Delicate
Balance and Stephen Foster's
production of Much Ado About
Nothing were scheduled for the same
nights, which put an especially heavy

‘drain on the number of actors
available. So Ron had to conjure up ’

his cast, which ranges from graduate
students in theater arts to a political
science professor to an executive
secretary at Alcoa. Ron describes all
of them as “professional and cour-
teous."

‘‘I want my actors to have fun, but I
want them to be in agony, too.
You've got to believe that one awk-

V ward move will make or break this

play. We're working with the sem-
biance of realism. It's not real life, but
it's realistically motivated."

llThen ‘

Part of the brief rehearsal time is
spent not in memorizing the script or
movements but in establishing

imaginary histories for each of the,

characters. Through improvisation of
scenes that will never appear on the
stage, Ron hopes to establish an
emotional base that he feels is essen-
tial to establishing the characters.

The set also is “real,” a
suggestion of a living room in the cen-
ter of the theater. The audience is

‘seated on four sides, as if the walls of
the room were transparent.

“That’s why all the technical
people are so important," Ron said.
“You have to trust them to make it
what you envision. I don’t dictate.’ I
may say, ‘I want this set to look like a
womb, but’ then i leave the technical
people to go their merry’ way.
Everyone has to know what he or she
is doing.

“We're all working like dogs. I
have to feel like I'm responsible for
every thread in the costumes. The
only unforgiveable thing for a director
is not making a choice. = You may be
wrong, but you must make a choice.”

Before she begins to light any show,.

Elizabeth reads the play, consults
with the director, talks to the costume

. designer, looks at the ground plan of _
the set, watches the actors’ faces

and bodies, and sits in on rehearsals.
Only then does she go to work.

“When lights move, they become
other characters," she explained.
“l’ve got to consider the fabrics in the
costumes‘, and watch the actors’
faces to see how they take light. The
director of this show asked for natural
daylight, so I’m using a clean white
light focused in each of the conver-
sation areas," she said, gesturing to
the living room furniture arranged in

, the center of the theater.

To get that light,., Elizabeth first
must climb a ladder to a grid on the
ceilingand test lighting instruments.

LIGHTING DIRECTOR

“I’ve been crawling around this
place for four years,” said Elizabeth
McKenna, lighting designer for A
Delicate Balance. 4

Elizabeth looked around‘ the
theater. With. its black ceiling and
floor and dark wood panels, it resem-
bles a large black box. “lt’s like a
tomb when there's nothing going
on—but when there are people
working, it really starts to look like a
theater.” '

Most of Elizabeth's work will be
done when the curtain goes up on the
play. A senior in theater arts, she is a
four-year veteran of the Studio.

Demanding Work Done Before CurtainRises

(Continued from page 4)

The instruments are relative antiques:
leftovers from the first WQED studio.
She sometimes has to strip one in-
strument to make another function. If
a director hasn't decided where his
actors or set will be, she has to
position the lights over and over. She
may have to come to every rehearsal
until the lighting is settled on—which,

in one case, was not until the night"

before the play opened.

“There have been times when I've
just brought my toothbrush and towel
and stayed all night, working until 3
a.m., crashing in the Studio until 7
a.m., waking up the people at Burger
Chef, and starting to work again.”

Although ‘rehearsal forA Delicate
Balance started" in mid-September,
the ground plan has been set for
some time, so Elizabeth won't have to
bring her toothbrush this time.

“lnA Delicate Balance the people
are all crazy, just barely on the line.
So I don't want to make the-light

_ isolating of startling, but subtle. For
75-this show, I'm making a puddle—an

amoeba of light. lt’s exciting to watch
a show you've Iit—to watch the
audience _responding to the play,

watch the people reacting to the"

lighting—or sometimes, not reac-
ting.” ‘ '

Audiences are more likely to rave
about the actors being lit than the
light itself, however. Elizabeth has
acted, but that type of glory doesn't
appeal to her. '

“There’s a kind of security in doing
lights. Unlike an actor, you’re never
physically on the line. At the same
time, though, the show depends on
you. lt’s an awful lot of responsibility,
but I, like the space and the people
who work here. And I love playing
with lights.”

She finished her dinnerfof Doritos
and went back up the ladder to play
with her black, dusty old—toys.

COSTUME DESIGNER

Lorraine Venberg talks between

‘cutting and pinning. As the show's

costume designer, she is also its
chief seamstress. Although you may
have seen her playing an orange
wench in The Country Wife, her usual
stage is the costume shop next to the
studio. She has one assistant,-—and
one day-to finish two-and-a-half
costumes. '

Like the lighting designer's work,
most of Lorraine’s labors are invisible.
She must read the play, consult the

director and the set designer, obser- '

ve and measure the actors, sit in on
rehearsals-and consult the budget.
While the script ofA Delicate Balance
calls for. 20 costumes, the Studio
budget was $100. The characters
thus will stay in the same costumes
throughout the play.

“It’s kind of scary,” Lorraine said
of her_job. “|’ve worked with the
Civic Light Opera and the Pittsburgh
City Players, but this is the first time
I've designed for a show.”

As the graduate assistant to the
costume shop, she is on double duty.
While making the costumes for A
Delicate Balance, she must also ad-
vise the students ’who are making 60
costumes for the cast of Much Ado
About Nothing.

‘‘I have to be done before 7 p.m.
tomorrow, but I'm going to make it,"
she. said. “When I designed this
show, the designs were just pic-
tures to me. I didn't see them on
people- Now, they have life.'’

THE ACTRESS

“l don’t think I’m playing Edna as
strongly as Ron wants me to. My

own emotional state affects my
character. I get schizy'-—| can't afford
to get schizy,” said Joyce Grear.

Joyce plays Edna," the woman
who, with her husband, flees her
house out of an unnameable fear.
She is a graduate student in theater
arts and a 25-year veteran of the
theater; she first performed at the
age of four.

She recently played the Queen of .

Spain in’ a Studio production of Arthur
Kopit’s Chamber Music .

“Edna’s marriage is so foreign to
me, so cold-blooded," Joyce said of
ner character. “lt's shallow, but at

the same time so tight, so binding.

That's not love to me.”

To reach an understanding of such
a marriage, Joyce and actor Jim

Harry—worked through a number of

phone call from Harry's pregnant
mistress. This scene will never ap-

Joyce's understanding of Edna.

“Harry's judged me. Harry's said,
‘You're nothing, you’re a zero...’ I feel
closer to Claire than to Agnes, even
though Agnes is my best" friend.
Harry has.slept with Claire, but it's
something she needed—l'm not
jealous of her."

The emotional intensity of the play

‘does not tire Joyce.

“Every time I read the play, I see
more of the tragedy in it. I always
keep my scripts. Five years from
now, I'll look at it, and understand it
more." '

At the end ofA Delicate Balance,
despite the falseness of the marriage
and their fear, Harry and Edna return
to their house.

“But we return having grown,”
said Joyce. “Edna doesn't want to
play anymore—l feel that in real life
too. I don't want to play anymore.
Edna's frustrated and angry—but
she's got a lot of fight left in her."‘

Super Bowl ‘/2: the Perils of Midget Football

By Nello Giorgetti

" I felt my mother's voice rather than
heard it. It was hard to hear anything
with the covers pulled over my head.
She was telling me it was 9:30 and
asking if I wanted to go to the football
game. As I fell out of bed, I felt for my
stomach. It was still there. lmoaned.

Last night's Black Velvet had
turned my insides into the Black
Swamp of Outer Darkness. I sat
on the floor and reached for my
pants. They were .rumpled, wrinkled
and stained.

So was I.

I shuffled to the bathroom and
tried to gargle and bnlsh the taste of
burnt ashes out of my mouth. I even
tried to comb my hair into some
semblance of order.

I stuck a Pitt baseball cap on my
head and resolved to not talk too
much.

My mother was sitting in the
kitchen smoking a cigarette and look-
ing vaguely miffed. What time had I
come in the night before?

I shook my head and tried to drink
a glass of cold milk without retching. I
asked her if she knew where the
football game was.

She told me. I stepped into the
cool September air, started up the
car, and pulled out in a fogbank of
burning oil.

My car is a 1970 Mercury with
too many miles and too few treads. It
burns oil as merrily as the stacks
smoke down at the Homestead J&L
steelworks and is a guaranteed
crowd-pleaser whenever I get stuck
in bumper-to-bumper traffic. I once
killed a family of eight in a station
wagon when the poor unfortunates
made the mistake of driving behind
me one moming on the Parkway
West. .,_,

But I digress from my story.

The reason that I woke up so early
on a Saturday momiing was that I am,
and probably will remain, a sucker for
little kids. Not childlren—that reminds
me vaguely of nannies and Sebastian
Cabot on Family Affair—but kids. I

never quite outgrew puberty and I en-.

joy being around kids. Not only do
they know who Doctor Octopus is,
where the Fortress of Solitude is and
the real identity of Captain America.
but like me they really believe in Hob-
bits, the Avengers and, of course,
the evil Doctor Victor Von Doom of
Latveria.

Claudio is such a kid. He is the
10-year-old son of one of my
mother's friends. And he, like many
younger people, ' respects the
judgement of older kids. It was my
playing high school football that made
him decide to try out for Midget
League.

That morning he would be playing
in his first game. He was counting on

me to be there. I was his big brother.
l’d taught him how to catch a football.

So I drove all the way out to Craf-
ton, gaging the inhabitants of
Thornburg and Rosslyn Farms along
the way. I started to feel half human.
The radio was playing some tasteless
fluff by the Bee Gees as I killed the
engine and the music near the foot-
ball field.

The field was covered with dwarfs
in bright red and gold, green and
gold, blue and gold and blue and
white. Along the sidelines were dwar-
fettes in the same color pat-
terns.

I walked through the damp grass,
Nikes soaking, and wished that I had
remembered to put on my boots.

down to watch the game.

There are two philosophies
followed in Midget League, or Little
League. You play to win, and if
everybody doesn't get to play, that's
just too bad. We all have to make
sacrifices, you know? The other
philosophy is to let everybody play
(even if some players can barely
remember how to tell left from right,
let alone run trap plays).

Today was the classic confron-
tation. '

Claudio's team subscribed to the
everybody plays, everybody has fun
idea. The other team would have
made Woody Hays proud.

I got closer to the field, and was
almost knocked over by a fat woman
with blue hair. She was running
toward the sidelines with a camera in
her pudgy fingers. I watched as one
of the dwarfettes posed in traditional
cheerleader stance, one pom pom
above her head, the other pom pom

_ held vertically from her hip.

I drew closer. ' This little
cheerleader was gorgeous. Her
blonde hair wasdrawn back into a
pony tail, which, along _.with sharply
defined cheekbones, gave her an
aristocratic air. She ‘had on lipstick,
andif I were a dwarf I would have
assaulted her behind the bleachers.
She carried herself regally, scarcely
deignlng ~to~"a'cknowledge her
mother's presence. She knew she
was the star of the show and accep-
ted it.

I began to hate her then.

I got a cup of coffee at the
refreshment stand and found a seat
at the top of the bleachers. A horde
of bees kept divebomblng me, so I
spilled half the coffee on my lap and
the woman in front of me thought I
was having an epileptic fit.

Claudio's mother made it to the
stands just as Claudio's name was
announced over the public address
system. She smiled at me, asked me
howl felt, and gave me a rare roast
beef sandwich. My stomach ac-

cepted this offering, and I settled

A "I \

kickoff what was going to happen.
Claudio's team got the ball, and im-
mediately fumbled when a dwarf ver-
sion of Donnie Shell hit the kickoff
returner with a blow that echoed in
the little stadium.
, The other team then proceeded to
ram the ball down Claudio's team's
collective throat for five successive
plays before they scored on a perfect
student body left sweep of 20 yards.

I asked Claudio's mom for another
sandwich. '

It was pretty humorous, if you get
into humiliating defeats. The highlight
of the game came when the quarter-
back on Claudio's team went behind
center, looked over the line, and
discovered that there were six men
to the right of the center and no one
to his left.

I watched Claudio's coaches,
three paunchy, middle-aged pillars of
middle class society, begin to tear
what was left of their hair out.

The head coach smashed his clip-
board into tiny pieces against his
forehead as his team fumbled the ball
at their 10-yard line.

The fans put on an even better
show. Their sons could do no wrong.
It was all because they weren't
coached right.

One nice old man—he looked like
a wrinkled Saint Nick—started to
exhort his little Jimmy to show
everybody what a man he was. Old

    
     
  
 

Saint Nick almost gagged and turned
a nice shade of red when little Jimmy
let a halfback slip through his grasp
and dart into the end zone.

The cheerleaders did cartwheels,
and led cheers that were inap-
propriate in the game situation. Only

their mothers in the stands bothered ‘

to follow them.

The cheerleaders were just like
their older high school and collegiate
counterparts. Cybil Shepherd II were
a bright plastic smile, and waved her
pom poms with that great Kennedy-
Camelot virtue, vigor. I projected her
a few years into the future. She
would date the captain of the football
team, go to college and marry an
older guy with money and some kind

‘I

of profession, a lawyer or a‘ dentist.
There really wasn't much else to
do except fantasize.

The other team kept its first string
in the entire game, and wiped out
Claudio's team 33 to nothing.

_ I gave Claudio a ride home. We
stopped at.a Baskin-Robbins, where I
bought him a banana cone. I was
very big brotherish, and told him _ it

_ really didn't matter if you won or lost,
but how you played the game.

Claudio looked at me as if I was

crazy. It didn't matter if you didn't
win? What garbage was this?
» Then it struck me.

Of course, the kid was right.
Where the hell did I come from,
spouting such alien seditious lies?
Outer Trantor? The only important
thing is winning. Everybody is taught
to strive, to fight, to win. Christopher
Columbus had to beg, borrow, and
kiss the derriere of Queen Isabella to
get his ships, but what the hell, he
won, didn't he? .

I asked Claudio if he liked his foot-
ball coach.

He kind of sneered and mumbled
something about too many lousy
players getting to play.

Claudio is only 10 years old, but
he already has grasped the essence
of Westem_thought. It is a philosophy
aptly stated by the venerable‘ Vince
Lombardi: -“Winning isn't everything,
it's the only thing.”

I wish I could reminisce and say
that when I was a kid, we used to play
in the vacant lot behind my house and
nobody even bothered to keep

score. I wish I could say that.

But I kept score. Hell, I even
cheated when I could. We always
won when lkept score. ‘

I scratched my head, and patted
Claudio on the shoulder pad. I told
him I was proud of him, and so was
Vince Lombardi.

He asked me who Vince Lombardi
was.

So I turned up the radio and
listened to an old Eagles tune,
"Tequila Sunrise." It's a song about
wasted lives and alcohol.

I felt it was appropriate.

LIKE YOURSELF* *AND OTHERS WILL, T00
IN THE BOOKCENTER FRIDAY, OCT. 13th
1:30-3:00 PM

Like Yourself*
*and others will too

by Abraham Twerski, M.D.

This book reveals how a negative self-
image may lie at the core of such prob-
lems as dissatisfaction, unhappiness and
loneliness.

It shows you how to use the new, effective
tool of depth psychology to improve your
relationships with friends, co-workers, and
family, and to discover a new you in your-
self.

Through dozens of actual case studies.
you'll see how an unwarranted negative
self-image is the common source of most
problems, from depression to dnnlfing.
narcissism to over-eating, anxiety _to inse-
curity. Following the practical guidelines
this book provides, you can eliminate
these problems from your life — not by Just
“pruning” away the symptoms, but by ac-
tually “uprooting” the underlying cause of
your problems.

Abraham Twerski is Clinical Director of
the Department of Psychiatry at St. Francis
General Hospital in Pittsburgh.

.Bowman’s Folly Erected Over Trustee Prtests

(Continued from page 3)

“Four o'clock in the morning came
before I left the house. Walking to
the suburban railroad station alone
under the stars, I was not tired for the
first time, after two years of effort, it
seemed we had made a start.”

Part of Bowman's dream also in-
cluded a Commons Room. He wan-
ted it to be a room approximately 100
feet by 200 feet and at least 60 feet
high. KIauder’s original design of the
Commons room made it 17 feet high,
with the floor cluttered with pillars.
Bowman. rejected this and Klauder
began to redesign the room. At
Bowman's insistence,'the room was
made entirely of stone.

Klauder wanted the stones for the

' Commons Room’s vaulted ceiling to

be slipped on iron bars shaped like
clothespins. He claimed the stones
would look exactly like solid masonry.
,“But those arches would be shams.

They would be frauds,” Bowman
retorted.

 

- C

To construct -the arches in any
other manner would ‘waste at least
$100,000, Klauder said.

“Let’s not argue," said Bowman.
“You cannot build a great University
with a fraud in it."

when the Commons Room was
finished its vaulted ceiling was solid
masonry, and Klauder told Bowman
he regarded, it as his greatest
achievement.

Many corporations and individuals
donated money to the Cathedral
building fund, in some cases as much
as $300,000. The most touching
donations, however, came from Pit-
tsburgh schoolchildren.

Bowman encouraged city
teachers to have each student con-
tribute 10 cents to the fund. Each
pupil explained how the dime was
earned in a letter to the University. In
return, he received a certificate
bearing his name, the purpose of the
donation, and a sketch of the

Cathedral. Ninety-seven thousand
certificates were issued.

By June 1925, the amount of
money pledged or paid totaled
$9,178,871.

As late as October 1925,
however, the Board of Trustees was
giving Bowman a hard time about the
tall strucure. At the Oct. 29 Board
meeting, the Trustees voted to ap-
prove a resolution that stopped any
further consideration of the proposed
tower. It also provided that no new
building on campus could be taller
than 100 feet. Only two board mem-
bers dissented.

Bowman's next action was to visit

‘Richard B. Mellon, president of

Mellon Bank. “ ‘l’ve'come on an

_ unusual errand,’ I said,” he wrote in

Unofficial Notes. “ ‘I'm asking no
questions. ldo not’ expect a reply. I
bring merely some information. I'm
going ahead at once with the con-
struction of the high building.’

After. the foundation walls were

Trustees met at the Duquesne Club

“After the dinner George Clapp, as
usual, called the meeting to order and
as usual I started to make some
report to the board. I had scarcely
started to talk, however, when John
H. Nicholson, president of the

National Tube, a division of U.S. Steel 

Corporation, interrupted me.

“ ‘By the way,’ he said, ‘We notice
a building going up out there. Would
you mind telling us what that is?’

“ ‘That’s the building we’ve been
talking about all these years,’ I said.

“ ‘How high is it going?’ someone
else promptly asked.

“ ‘Let’s face the facts,’ I said. ‘You
know them as well as I do. Last Sep-
tember, with little encouragement,
we started to build. Here we are.’

“ ‘Did you get the plan the way you
wanted it?’ another Trustee asked.

More on the Teaching/ Research Dilemma

By ROBERT L. WOLKE

' Recent issues of The Pitt News
have carried editorials, stories and
opinion pieces on the general issues
of teaching and research at the
University of Pittsburgh. The views
of former Dean Marshall, of Dean
Schulman, of editorial writers and
of various faculty members and
Letters-to-the Editor writers have
been aired in every medium within
the University and in almost all of
the local media for some time now,

‘ especially since the resignation of

Dean Marshall in June. Some
people are making statements that
are obviously ill-founded or mis-
directed, while others are indig-
nantly replying to-statements that
haven’t been made.

It is time, I think, that this
far—ranging and free-swinging dis-
course should take on some focus.
There are three reasons that I feel I

» might try to separate some of the

real issues from the false ones. (1) I
am a teacher who has taught
thousands of Pitt students in my
eighteen years here as a professor,
(2) I am a researcher whohas
directed research funded by

1 government grants and published

dozens of papers and books, and (3)
at the request of the Provost nine
months ago, I took on the job of
seeing what might be done to place
more emphasis on high-quality
teaching throughout the University.
Yes, the administration is really
spending time and money on trying

to improve teaching quality. But ’

more about that later.

First, let me mention one thing
that will never improve teaching at
this University:

If we ‘add 'up all the

faculty hours spent on teaching, and
then add up all the hours spent on
research, the numbers may not be
equal. So what? There’s no more
reason to lament the hours the
faculty members spend in research
or in writing books than there is to
lament the hours they spend in
reading books, in driving to work, or
in cheering on the Panthers. There
are still an awful lot of hours spent

ers in teaching: around 17,000

The Pitt News editorial of
"September 8 says, “Those on the
faculty whospend their time writing
and publishing get tenure; those
who spend. their time writing
comments on students’ papers do
not. ’ ’ It’s perfectly true that doing a
good job of teaching takes time.
And so does research. But its not a
matter of spending one’s time on
one or the other. There’s enough
time in the . average faculty
member’s reported 54-hour work
week for plenty of both. Wishing
that we had more teachers teaching

in student

and fewer researchers researching .

is like a football coach’s wishing he
could put more than eleven men on
the ﬁeld. Instead, the coach’s
efforts--and a university's--should
be directed toward getting the
highest quality results out of the
players we do have. Why not just
focus» on how the teaching that is
done at Pitt can be done in the best
possible way, to the maximum
benefit of the students?
Everyone has had good, bad and
mediocre teachers. Think of some
terrible ones you’ve had. Were they
that way because they did research?
Very probably not. Think of some
of the . inspiring teachers you’ve
had. , Were they that way because
they’ve never published? Not
likely. the simple fact is that there
isn’t any occupation or profession in
the world that doesn’t contain some

people who do the job better than '
‘ others.

_A person of great
intellectual vitality and enthusiasm
is likely to be the better teacher.

. And such a person is quite likely to

find the time to devote to

_ conscientious teaching, even if he or n

a lot and gets a fair shakeifrom his or

course. The issue is not whether the
instructor also happens to be doing

research. Or whether the course in.

question happens to be required.
So let’s take those 17,000 hours
per week and see what can be done
to make them as stimulating a
learning experience as they can
possibly be. How can the system
be adjusted, to provide both the
motivation and the assistance that
faculty members need to do their
teaching in the most effective way,
without our ceasing to be a powerful
research univesity? This is the

question that the University admin- '

istration is now addressing.

 
 
   
  

  
  
  

- .. . .  S
'to~=be debated and deliberatedflzy S

It started- almost exactly three

years ago, when-in recognition of .

the rumbling among students and

faculty to the effect that more '

attention should be given to

teaching, the Provost appointed a

committee of faculty and students to
study what should and could be
done. As everyone knows,
universities. grind slowly along the
road to change. One hard-working
committee led to another. There
were no newspaper headlines. But
by November of 1977, the
committees had made their recom-
mendations. The Provost accepted
and acted upon them. Prof. Grace
Lazovik’s teaching evaluation ser-
vices which had previously been a
small operation within CAS, was
given-a budget of its own and the
mission of. helping to evaluate
teaching throughout the University.

In addition, the Office of Faculty
Development was created, with
funds also supplied by the
administration, to coordinate a
Uni_versity-wide effort to improve
teaching. I accepted the director-

ship of that office because I believe

that teaching and research are

equally important missions of the

University, but that more attention
needs to be given to the
encouragement and -importance of
good teaching.

To make any progress in that

direction, the University -has to do
two kinds of things: '(1) offer free
services to faculty members to help
them improve their teaching and (2)
make it worthwhile for more
faculty members to want to improve‘
their teaching. We're trying to do
both. These are tough jobs. Some
will say they're impossible. But the
point for now is that such efforts are
being ‘ made at Pitt. The
administration is putting some of its
scarce money where its mouth is.

Cynics are welcome to believe that

this is happening because the

administration realizes it has to
hustle to compete for the nation’s
dwindling supply of students. .
Maybe. But it's happening
nevertheless. And its started
happening, quietly and deliberately
long before Bob Marshall stepped
down as dean of CAS. v
There can’t be any overnight
miracles. It -is unrealistic to expect
that good teachers who don’t
publish at all will suddenly be

getting tenure, or that world-re-
nowned researchers will be rejected

as potential Pitt faculty members’
‘unless they ﬁrst pass the test of '

undergraduate teaching. But-‘the

Office of Faculty Development and »

the Office for the Evaluation of
Teaching have set into motion a

varietyiof programs to help and
encourage faculty members to do i

their teaching jobs as well as
possible. (I’ll welcome suggestions

from any student or faculty"

member, _as to where my ofﬁce
might put some of its efforts, to do
the most good for quality teaching
at Pitt. Just send them to 901A,
Cathedral of Learning.) ,The
faculty’s response to our programs
thus far has ‘been encouraging, and
it‘ is steadily growing. As more
faculty members and department
chairmen accept the notion that
caring about good teaching is not
inconsistent with caring about
scholarly research, the false

controversy over teaching vs.

research will simply evaporate.

chemistry department and Director of

  A Savoy Brown, Alvin Lee Back For GreatRock

By M. PATRICK MONAHAN

Pitt News Staff Writer

' _ } Never let it be said that veteran British rockers Alvin Lee and Ken
. Simmonds are lacking in ability as guitarists; ' '
Both men recently have released albums after long periods of
inactivity and have come back hot ’n’ rockin’. -
.. - Lee hasn’tmade an album since 1975, when his “Pumpin’ Iron” die
' a commercial death on the charts and Columbia subsequently decided to
send him packin’. .
Simmonds still records for his long-time label, London, but his recent
1 release, “Savage Return-”, is the first time in years his band, Savoy
‘Brown, has produced the kick and fire exhibited on such classic albums
-as “A Step Further” and “Hellbound Train.” '

In fact, this juggling of lineups is the main reason why Savoy Brown '
never has caught on as anything other than a cult band. ‘

It’s always cut down on the public’s ability to identify the band and
hurt Savoy Brown in developing a strong and consistent touring unit.

A Lee ﬁnally has set to rest Ten Years After, ‘the band he guided to
superstardom in the early '70s then saw ride into the dust when radio
softened and refused to play his brand of music. His new release
“Rocket Fuel,” on RSO (Robert Stigwood Organization) Records has
gone back to basics, recording with just a bassist (Mick Hawksworth)
and drummer (Tommy Compton).

Y The sound is hot and tight, two-fistedlblues-rock (“Rocket Fuel,”.
“Gonna Turn You On” and “The Devil’s Screamin"‘), switching to the
howling, scat guitar blues no. (‘Friday the 13th,” “Baby Don’t You
Cry”), which have become his trademark. .

Simmonds, on “Savage Return, ” also sticks to the trim trio recording
unit of just guitar, bass and vocals (Ian Ellis) and drums (Tom Farnell).

Outstanding cuts include “Rock ’n’ Roll Man,” “Walk Before You
Run” and “Double Lover,” and are fine testaments to his recognized

Y ability as a boogie ’n’ blues guitarist.

If .you’re looking for these two albums to pop up on the charts or on
your favorite AM station or for that mattEf, on the contemporary FM
dial, forget it. The records already seem to have died a commercial
death.

However, for old fans, and those daring enough to check out the
albums, you'll be treated to some hot ’n’ tasty blues rock from two

- performers who helped pioneer the genre of British blues rock back 
the late '60s and early '70s.

And in this age of synthesized mass-produced disco music, it's good to
see two such talented guitarists with rock ’n’ roll still pumping through

filled with solid bluesy rock-. —

Savoy Brown is back on the charts after a -long absence with another album

Blue Oyster Cult

Blue Oyster Cult once was one of
America’s most overrated and
sloppy bands. ’

From 1972 until 1975, the
ﬁve-man band from Long Island

‘toured the states under the grisly
banner of heavy metal-fascist
leather rockers, seemingly foresak-~

. ing ‘everything that had to do with

music.

They were truly one of the first
punk bands to emerge in the early
’70s—kin gs of slime even before the
media had picked up on wearing
torn clothes, vomiting,‘ and pub-
licizing themes of dominance and
submission.

If you saw the band back in its
early days, you will not believe the

' change in the cult. The band has

come on strong and improved the
show with dynamically placed
rainbow lasers and releasing
albums that say more than thud,
‘buzz and fuzz.

has been heading in the last two
years and shows how much it has
improved.

Although the album is the
group’s second live disc, it makes
its prior effort, “On Your Feet, Or
on Your Knees,” sound ‘like audio
fodder. '

The album features
dynamic tunes, which now make up
most of the band's live show, and
the sound mix is both crisp and
enjoyable.

The hit singles, “Don’t Fear the
Reaper” and “Godzilla,” the two
songs that provided the first AM
airplay for the band in 1976 and
1977, give focus for the—album. The
Cult includes several new tunes,
“Are U Ready 2 Rock,” and a
golden oldie by the Animals, “We
Gotta Get Out of this Place.”

Also included is the classic
” one of the band’s
ﬁrst songs that featured intelligent
lyrical themes and haunting syn-
thesizers.

‘ The band always has held a soft

. spot in many hearts because of its

depiction of such bizarre themes.

cult topics as going to hell (“Hot
Rods to Hell”), death (Don’t'Fear
the Reaper”), the undead
(“Noferestu”) and that immortal
city-eating‘ monster song
(“Godzilla”).

During the group’s recent visit to
Pittsburgh, bassist Joe Bouchard
offered insight into what the band is
trying to do with its strange

. approach to music. -

“We've had our ups and downs
with our leather ’n’ metal image,”
said Bouchard, “but, we've always
tried to offer people an alternative
with the content of our songs.

“Face it," he added, “half the
songs you'll ever hear either deal
with romance, heartbreak or
normal, everyday things. After
hearing boring disco and fuddy
duddy, hard-rock instrumental

‘themes that don't say anything,
fans and the band can get bored real
quick.” ,

Bouchard also claimed the Cult’s
dealing with such unique themes
has helped keep himself, drummer

Joe Bouchard (his brother), vocalist

and guitarist Eric ‘Bloom, lead
guitarist Don Roeser and. key-
boardist-guitarist‘ Allen Lanier

Like I the parent magazine,
“People” is long on pictures and
short on prose. However, the
photography is nothing special, and
the lack of depth is embarrassingly
great. The half-hour presents eight
separate stories. Phyllis George is

‘more a society reporter than
anything else-—the reducing salon
was introduced by her as “one I go
to frequently.”

Unless there are drastic changes
made in the format, the makers of

“People” seem doomed to present; -

Panthers To Study Consistency for Irish Test

.Even though mid-tegn exam-
inations don’t get into full swing
until next week, the Pitt Panthers
will face their ﬁrst‘ stern test this
Saturday in a journey to South
Bend to battle Notre Dame.

With a 2-2 record, the Irish of
1978 may lack the national ranking
of other Notre Dame squads, but
the tradition and prestige remain.
For this reason, a victory over
Notre Dame, especially in South
Bend, is still one of the sweetest
things this side of a gingerbread
house. . a

“We got off to a rather slow
start,” said Irish head coach Dan
Devine. “Some of the reasons ‘for
the start are excuses and some are
not, but schools play some pretty
good football games against’ us.”

Pitt head coach Jackie Sherrill

‘hopes the Panthers choose this

Saturday to put the ﬁnal’ touches on
a potentially powerful
team.

“There won't be any question
about wanting to play ,well this
week,” said Sherrill. “The players
have been looking for Notre Dame
for a year.

“We will have to be consistent,”
Sherrill added. “You hear that
word a lot and may think it’s
overplayed, but it is true.”

Sherrill especially will be looking"
for some consistency from the
offense which has yet to put four
good quarters together. According
to quarterback coach Joe Pendry,
Rick Trocano ‘is improving weekly
and is coming off,his best game of
the season against Boston College.
'* “Rick has improved his option
game—now he’s pitching. the
ball,” said Pendry. “After looking
at the Boston College game ﬁlms,‘
we could ﬁnd onlyﬁtwlo times when
Rick kept the ball when he should
have pitched it.

“He’s also improved his throw-
ing,” Pendry added. “Rick has
been coming off his primary
receivers and ﬁnding the secondary
targets. And by not forcing the
ball, he’s not throwing intercep-

football I

tions.” Trocano’s lone interception
of the, season came on a pass that
pd/eﬂected off the hands of Rooster
Jones and into the arms of a
defender. _ ,

The running attack was also a
bright spot in last week’s win, with
starters Rooster Jones and Fred
Jacobs combining for 189 yards on
45 carries. Larry Sims, the team’s
leading rusher until an ankle injury
kept him from making the trip‘ to
Chestnut Hill, will return to action

this week and should add some
depth. .
‘ “We’ve been called pony
backs,” said Jacobs; referring to
the lack of size among the regular
runners. “They say we won't last
the season, but we've put a lot of
people on the ground." ,
According to Sherrill, the Pan-
thers will not‘ be able to give away
good ﬁeld position and ‘can’t afford
to “lay the ball on the ground”
because “if you do that at Notre

Dame, things snowball.” ‘ V
The Panthers failed to move up
in at least one Poll’s rankings,
despite Texas dropping out of the
top ten. Nebraska vaulted from
10th to eighth. .
“Right now, I don’t think we
should be higher than number
nin'e,"’ said Sherrill, “but this
week, we’ll ﬁnd out.”
I The mid-season grade for the
football team ‘will be posted

the cast removed from his left ankle
and is expected to start Saturday...

pionships...The game will be

Pantherette Harriers Disappoint Coach in Loss to Bucknell 

By SUE McFARLAND
Pitt News Staff Writer

Pitt's women's cross country
team suffered a disappointing
28-31 loss this weekend at the
hands of Bucknell.

Despite the setback, Pitt man-
aged to place one and two in the
meet; Margie Lee crossing the
ﬁnish line ﬁrst with a time of 20:33,
followed by Diane Miller, who
ﬁnished with a time of 20:43. Miller
edged out Bucknell’s Sue Cluzel,
who crossed the ﬁnish line in
20:431. Finishing third for Pitt and
ﬁfth overall was Jean Drexler, with
a time of 21:16.

Head coach Alfreeda Goff

“ termed the race run by Drexler as

her best of the year but was not
pleased with the team’s overall
performance.

“I can accept defeat, but defeat

as it was at Bucknell,” Goff said,
“It was the way /We lost that
irritated me; we actually .beat
ourselves.” _

Goff added that both she and her
assistant ‘Mary Ellen Shea have
“jumped on the girls pretty hard”
because of ‘ ‘ unnecessary V defeat. ’ ’

‘ ‘We’ve had three girls who have
really been doing ‘the job, but the
rest have just not been doing their
part,” Goff said, “This'isn’t'fair to
the girls who are working, and
there just isn’t any reason for it.”

The head coach said a lack of
self-conﬁdence is a major problem
that has persisted all season.

“They get to the starting line,
and they tell themselves they‘ can’t
do it. Before the gun even goes off

, they tell themselves they can’t do
it. When the race ﬁnally begins,
they have themselves talked in to it

so much they actually can’t do it.”
. Goff said she plans a change in
strategy in the upcoming meet
against Indiana University of
Pennsylvania. She said she will
move the women who normally
start in the front to the back and
switch the other women to the
front. I ,
Traveling £0 IUP, Pitt will meet
the Indians for. the second time this
season. They ﬁrst met. at the

California State Invitational, where
Pitt ﬁnished third and IUP ninth.‘

“That was at the beginning of
the season, however, and ‘I'm sure
Indiana has improved since then. I
certainlyhope we have,” Goff said.

‘Melanie’ Nickerson is the. only .

team member not at full strength
physically for the weekend meet.
Nickerson was lost for the season at

the Penn ‘State Invitational with a _

stress fracture. ’

With the end of the‘ season
nearing, Goff amended some of her
team’s ‘goals as set early in the
year.

‘ ‘At one point we were hoping to ”'

, go to Eastems as a team, but now it

doesn’t‘look as though this is going
to happen,” Goff said". “Right now
there is a chance‘ that we might
send ‘a few individuals, but this all
depends on our meet with Slippery
Rock next week.”

Yogi Berra Excited by 20th Series

:4

By The Associated Press

LOS ANGELES—-After 31 years_
and 19 -World Series, one might
suspect the big autumn baseball
bash would fade into just another

bland exercise. But not for Yogi-

Berra.
“Every one is different - no way to
get bored,” said the stubby
ex-catcher who as player, coach
and manager has made a career of
collecting rings, silverware and
negotiable currency in the game’s
annual championship showdown.
The Silver Jubilee Series, which
opened yesterday between the New
York Yankees and Los 'Angeles
Dodgers, marked the 20th appear-
ance in the event ‘for Berra. He

participated in 14 as Yankee No. 6.
He managed in two others — with
both the Yankees and‘New York
Mets. He served as Mets coach in
another and ‘is going into”, his third
as coach of the Yankees.

There’s no other personality
even ‘close in World /’Series
exposure. Yogi still holds a passel
of Series records, including most
games (75), at bats (259), hits (71 ;
and errorless games (30).

His total Series share is ﬁgured at
around $300,000.

No one perhaps is better
qualiﬁed _to make comparisons
between the 1978 American League
champions and the Yankee dread-
naughts of the past. '

“There have been more powerful
teams - like the 1961 team, for

instance, which could blow your ‘

head off,” he said, “but I don’t
know if I’ve ever seen a team that
handles pressure better than this
one.” . ’

“It’s a gutsy team,” he added.
“They are ﬁghters. They refuse to
be licked. You can see it in their
eyes.”

Berra recalled the club's bounce-
back from 14 games behind the
Boston Red Sox in July, the
dramatic come-from-behind tri-
umph in the sudden-death playoff
in Boston and the late rallies in the
division playoffs against‘ Kansas
City. 6

“When you play sweeper you
touch the ball a lot less, and
everytime you come in contact with
it, it’s very important,’_’ Nigh said.

Nigh’s experiments have proved
very successful this season: His ﬁve
goals lead the Panthers in scoring.

Assistant coach Richard Blackett.
believes Nigh’s goals have been

good ones. i .

‘ ‘Karl has been playing well in our
games this season," said Blackett.
“He has been supporting the
forwards and has scored on some
very well-taken shots. Karl is
basically a very sound soccer player;
and I believe he has the ability to
become an excellent player.”

Nigh believes scoring is one of the
hardest things to do in the game.

‘ ‘Scoring is the name of the game,
it encompasses so very in ch. You
can't simply take the ball outside the
goal and shoot and expect to score. A
team must be able to work the ball

Nigh. “Since the acquiring of a few
players, like midﬁelder Johnny

to where we are now playing the

Aquestion that many athletes ask . I

themselves, including Nigh, 1 is
whether they are capable of playing
professional sports“ Nigh has an
edge by playing for the team that is
due to become the Pennsylvania
