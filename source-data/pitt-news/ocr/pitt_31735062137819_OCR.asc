Alumni Council Establish Stu-

to Aid Students and
Graduates

The Committee of the Alumni
Council, which was appointed to de-
vise means by which needy students
might secure ‘employment, reported

Monday evening to the Alumni Coun— ‘
Acil a comprehensive plan for aiding
‘students in securing positions ’and.in

aiding alumni in securing better
places. The report embodies a plan
for one of the most efﬁcient and best
organized student help bureaus to be
found in any ‘college in -this: country.
Dr. Waltholur Riddle, President of the
Council, said it was the most complete
and careful report ever submitted to
Council. '

' .The newbureau will undertake to

secure employment for graduates who

are working and who are anxious and.

ambitious‘ to better their circum-

— stances, for students immediately after

graduation, and for undergraduates
during the vacation periods and at

' various odd jobs which can be ac-

cepted by them during the academic
year, with'out detriment to their school
work. The work will be “conducted
along the lines suggested by the ex-

Last Friday evening the members
of the Freshman class, Medical De-
pagment, entertained the Sophomores
at one of the Pittsburgh theaters.
Following a custom established sev-
eral years ago, 'the incoming class

Sophomores.» In return for this
courtesy, no class ﬁghts are held by
the upper class. ’ I

i The celebration held this week was
the best ever held by the.Medi-cal De-
partment and both classes were well
represented. The University yells
were given with vim and spirit. Dur-
ing the evening. an attempt was made
to place the class officers in the boxes,
but after a rather forcible struggle

Student Band Malees

Initial Appearance

 

Fine Work Done by Band at First
,Try-Out Last Saturday.

The Pitt Student Band made its
first appearance at the Ohio Nort_hern
game -last Saturday. Although the
students had expected a very "ﬁne
band, yet it far exceeded all expecta-
ti'ons.\ Besides playing all the Pitt
songs, it rendered some very ‘fine music
between halves. At the end of the
concert given by the bands during
the intermission, the stands gave a
great ovation to the band. Againand

‘again the students gave “three times

three” to -the Pitt Student Band.

In speaking of the fast work done
in organizing the band, D. I. Kirk,
'13, who was largely responsible for
the organization of the new band, said
that such rapidity was possible only
through the efforts of A. R. Hamil-
ton, the Athletic authority, and a
few of the students interested in this
work. Mr. Hamilton is a zealous
worker in all University affairs and
when he backs a project it always
goes through quickly and efficiently
In less than a week’s time the -band
was organized, trained, and led the
rooters at the football game last Sat-
urday. ‘ I

The members of the band are'the
following:

Pharmacy Professor
is Honored

Dr. Beali Elected to Editorship of
Leading Journal.

James H. Beal, Professor of Phar-
macy of the Pittsburg College bf
Pharmacy, was elected General Sec-
retary and Editor-in-Chief for the
publication of the Journal of the
American Pharmaceutical Association
at the recent meeting of the Associa-
tion in Boston, Mass., week of August
14th. —* ’

Dr. Beal was Dean of the Scio Col-
lege of Pharmacy for a number of
years. About the fall of 1902 he moved
his department to Pittsburg and a
short time afterwards consolidated
with the Pittsburg College of Phar-
macy. His good judgment and accu-
rate knowledge in his chosen ﬁeld of
labor has been a great ‘help to the col-
lege; in fact too much cannot be said
for him and his work. Today the

Senior class, is the largest in the his ‘ ,
Chancell'or was that of the students’'_ 7

tory of the college, due to the unre-
mitting effort of Prof. Beal, A new
lecture room has been recently pro-
vided. While Prof. Beal’s new work
prevents him from delivering any lec-
tures to the class at the present time,
he will resume his duties ‘here, ab'out
the ﬁrst of next year.

The Association 'has, for _a long
time, been looking for a man who
they could elect that would be capable
of taking charge of such a large
amount of work. However, the prob-
lem has been solved and great results
are anticipated. Prof. Beal’s paper
entitled, “The Teaching of Pharma-
ceutical, Arithmetic in Colleges of
Pharmacy,” which he read at the con-
vention, was quite an elaborate one.

Archer Makes Address

A large crowd turned out for chapel
Monday to hear Raymond L. Archer,
’l0, make his farewell address in the
University, as he leaves in a few days
for Java to take up mission and edu-
cational work there.

While in the University Mr. Archer

 

 

_took part in-a large number of sch‘ool

activities, and his strength of charac-
ter and pleasing manner gave to him

i the admiration and respect of all his

Fine Speeches
Made

The second chapel exercises of the’

entire student body of the University
was held in Memorial Hall on
Wednsday, Octobr 11, 1911. It had
for its main feature the discussion of
plans for the one hundred and twenty-
ﬁfth anniversary celebration next Feb-
ruary, several speeches along this line
being made." ,, »
After devotional service the second
part of the meeting was opened by
singing, “Hail t‘o Pitt!” Kirk leading.
Then Chancellor McCormick made a
short address, asking the students to
start early in pre-paratioii for their
main feature of the anniversary cele-
bration———-the pageant. This should be
and will be the greatest thing of its
kind ever seen in Pittsburgh, if only
the students get.to work early and.
taking plenty of time, work and plan
until every detail is,perfected and suc-
cess is assured. .

He said that ‘he had on many occas- I

ions spoken of this, but had not as
yet seen much result. Now he in-
tends to. turn the matter over entirely
to the students and they must organ-
ize and devise a plan for this build-
ing. “The needof such a building
.cannot be denied, and it devolves en-
tirely upon the students whether they
aregoing to meet this demand or let
the demand keep up, unsupplied,” said

' the Chancellor.

.Dr. Lewin, of the Allied Boards of
Trade, spoke on increasing the school
spirit, and of making the celebration
. in
Pitts_burgh’s history. He promised
that the various departments of the
city would give all the support in their
power.

A George Kirk made a pointed speech
on school spirit and its power t'o make
men act. He brought out clearly the
fact that it is better to be in the Uni-

‘ versity of Pittsburgh, having an active

part in building itand making it a

. power for yearsto come, than to be
i a student in an older University that
" has reached its zenith, and where you
' do n'ot have the chance of helping to

build your University.

Mr. French, from the Dental School,
pledged that department to support
the work of the celebration. “We
will be right up in the front line when
the action takes place,” was the man-
ner in which he indicated the spirit
of the “Dents.”

‘Several other speeches were made.

all full of the. spirit that will make

ourone hundred and twenty-ﬁfth an-
“One
thing there‘ is to be done,” said one
of the student leaders, “get down to
work and make the celebration every-
thing it ought to be. Start early; let
there be deﬁnite and coherent action;

' let the University spirit be dominant
in every student’s heart, and the cele-

btration will be greater than can be
now realized.”

PRINCETON UNIVERSITY.

Freshman Class Numbers 394-—A New
Department of Hygiene.

Statistics of Princet‘on’s freshman
class show’ that the total enrolment
is 394—an increase of 44 over. the en-

tering class of last year, and the larg--

est in the history of the university.
Of the 394 ‘freshmen, 133 are candi-
dates for the A. B. degree, 206 for the
Litt. B. and B. S. degree, while 55
are taking the C. E. course. The gain
is almost entirely in candidates for
the Litt-. B. and B. S. courses, the A.
B. men sh'owing a gain of seven, and
the C. E. men a loss of ten, as coin-
pared with last year. .The total stu-
dent enr_olment has not been ofﬁcially
compiled, but it is probable that it
will reach 1,550. The largest enrol-
ment in any previous year was 1,442,
the ﬁgure for 1910-1911.

A new department of hygiene and
physical education has been estab-
lished this year, from funds donated
by an alumnus for this speciﬁc pur-
pose. Under the direction of Prof.
Joseph E. Raycroft, formerly of the

University of Chicago, it is expected -

that the department will effectively
safeguard the health and physical wel-
fare of the students, create a more
wholesome and sane undergraduate

attitude toward college, sports, and

bring about a more general participa-
tion in athleticsion the part of the
studentbody as a whole. I The pro-
gram of the department includes a
course of lectures on hygiene by Dr.
Raycroft, which is compulsory for
freshmen, and the requirement that
all. freshmen engage in some form of
athletic exercise, either out of doors
or in the gymnasium. Prof. Ray-
croft has associated with him Dr. Ed-
win Fauver, who comes to Princeton
from Swarthmore, as supervisor. of
gymnasium work, and assistant in
physical examinations and in courses
in hygiene; Frederick W. Leuhring,
who comes from Ripon College as
supervisor of outdoor games; Frank
J. Sullivan, instructor inswimming,
and John E. Wolf, gymnasium in-
structor. ‘

The bureau of self help, which has
been conducted by the Philadelphia
Society (the college Young Men’s
Christian Association) for the past
three or four years, has been re-
organized and placed ‘on a more per-
manentand efficient basis, under the
auspices of the Graduate Council.
The bureau is managed by H. W. Bux—
ton, ’94. Opportunities for self-help
at Princeton are more limited than
at some universities located in the
large cities, but the present organiza—
tion of the bureau will be ofgreat
value to students who are obliged to
earn part or all of their college ex-

penses.

“Victory over Cornell” shall be the
‘slogan of the rooter from now until
the twenty-eighth and if, on that
eventful day the Blue and Gold shall
be triumphant, the words should ring
in our ears for years to come. But

- let each rooter never forget that the
outcome of that coming conﬂict rests
upon him to no small degree. It will
be a time when strength will be
matched with strength and spirit with
spirit and the result of this conﬂict
will result largely on the reality and
‘genuineness of the spirit which is
back of our team. It sh'ould be’ every
student’s desire to accompany the
team to Ithaca, but if this is impos-
sible let him manifest his desire to go
in the manner in which he supports
the team and roots up to the time of

YALE UNIVERSITY.

For More Efficient Class Secretaries-
High Costs of Graduate School.

An effort will be made to make the
Yale Class Secretaries’ Association
more efficient by securing a more ac-
tive group of individual secretaries,
some of whom are averse to giving up
ofﬁce. The plan provides for a period
of seven years as the term of service
of each secretary, who, however, will
be eligible for reelection.
will be seven years apart so as to
avoid hasty action of a class in re-
union years. Should the plan be
adopted, the Bureau of Class Secre-
taries will provide the election ma-
chinery. ’

The ofﬁce of Yale’—s secretary is now
making a collection of biographical
material relating to graduates. This
is obtained from original sources. It
will _-be classiﬁed, but probably not
published, and no attempt will be
made to render it complete. ,

Attention ‘has been called by the
last-report of the university treasurer
to the fact that the Graduate School
which had last year 441 students, cost
$65,575, while its receipts were but
$19,732, of which $18,767 came from
tuition. Its deﬁcit was thus $45,793,
aud in addition it received a large
amount of instruction given by pro-
fessors of the two undergraduate de-
partments. The average amount re-
ceived per student for the high class
of instruction given for the advanced
degrees was but $42.56, or a little
»more than 10 per cent. of the ex-
penses, the only department paying
less being the Theological School,
where no charge is made for tuition.
Students in the two undergraduate de-
partments pay about iﬁve and a half
times as much per student as the
average student in the Graduate
School. A

Plans for the improvement of the
addition of about thirty-two acres to
the athletic. ﬁeld——obtained~ at .a‘ cost
of about $50,000———will provide -next
year for two or t'hree football ﬁelds,
and several baseball diamonds. The
new addition will be free to all stu-
dents and no gate money will be
charged for athletic events. The cost
of levelling, seeding, and turﬁng will
be large. _

Reticence of the Scientiﬁc School
authorities on the subject indicates
that the transfer of the New Haven
Colony Historical Society building to
the Fellows property on Whitney .ave-
nue ‘bought by the Sheffield trustees
is under consideration. Should this
be accomplished, it would leave’but
two properties, one of them small, to
be acquired for the completion of
Vanderbilt square. The Stoddard
house on the square b'ought some time
ago is now used as a -dormitory by
about twenty-six students. Excluding
men rated down into thegclass f'or
poor scholarship, the new freshman
class of the school numbers 408, as
compared with 369 last year. I V

THE STUDENT BAND._

Nothing in years -has aroused so
much enthusiasm in the University as
has _the organization of the Pitt Stu-
dent Band. With but four practices
the men made a showing unexcelled
The
_rapid progress made by the band is
due to the backing of the band by our
alumni and the loyal work of the stu-
dents. A
, Great credit is due to both alumni
and students for their work in organ-
izing the band. We believe ‘that a
Student Band will help more to build

I up ‘school spirit than an'y other stu-
"dent organization.

By leading the
undergraduates at the football games,

by holding concerts, by playing for

our .Uf1iversit~y events, the members

, I G of the -band will perform a greatlwork
q in building up_Pitt spirit. The work

which\they have done is great.‘ We
heard upon every side the greatest

L commendation _for their work _ last -
Saturday.

We congratulate both
‘alumni an-d students in securing this
new musical organization.

ANNIVERSARY WEEK.

_ At l_ast week’si convocation, the ﬁrst
announcement -was ‘made concerning

' the student .'plans for the great anni-

versary celebration‘to be held in Feb-
ruary of this school year. As there
remains but little time to prepare for
this event the students must act im-
mediately. A committee of "students
should be organized at the ﬁrst gen-
eral meeting of“ the student body.
Then every man in the school should
turn in his name tolthe committee as
a-volunteer to help his school cele-

V -brate its one hundred and twenty-ﬁfth

anniversary. This is an undertaking
too big for any one man or group of
men. .To be a success it is necessary
for every man in the University to
take an active part. It will not be

sufficient for a man to approve the

plan suggested. He must enter into
the work with all the enthusiasm and
zest at his command., Weliknow of
no--better‘ way by which the attention
of the whole country may be drawn

 to the work which the University of

i made a wise choice.

COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY.

 

,Treasurer’s Report Shows That Run-

ning Expenses Last Year Were Met.

According to the report of John
McLean Nash, treasurer of the uni-

versity, the ﬁscal period ending June

30 was the ﬁrst in many years in
which Columbia’s current income and
gifts were sufficient to meet the ‘run-
ning expenses of the university. The
cost of carrying on the ‘work of the

‘university proper, that is, exclusive of

Barnard and Teachers College and the
College of Pharmacy, was $1,990,020.
The three other branches together

_were maintained at aitotal cost of

more than _$1,000,000.

-permanent fund,'as well as those
donated for immediate use, amounted
to $2,535,064. The report further
shows that collections on the John
Stewart Kennedy bequest amounted
to $1,975,000, and that the trus-
tees had set the sum aside as
a separate endowment fund for
general -educational purposes. Of the
George Crocker bequest for cancer
research, $693,333 had -been received,
and a special committee of seven, in-
cluding President Butler, was named
to formulate plans for the develop-
ment of reesarch work along this line.
Mr. Nash’s "report also mentioned re-
Carnegie
Foundation for professors’ pensi'ons
and for allowanc-es to windows of pro-
fessors. -
The new philisophy building, which

stands between St. Paul’s Chapel and

Kent Hall, is now in use. It is de-
signed to c'onform with the architec-
ture of the other campus buildings,
and in plan resembles the Sch'ool of
Mines closeiy. An innovation‘in the
new hall is a room at the end of the
main corridor for-the exclusive use of
women in the graduate schools. ‘The
numberof. women pursuing courses

0

in political science and philosophy at
Columbia ‘has increased steadily, and
.a room of this sort has long been
needed. It is furnished as a general
lounging and reading room. '
A petition fr'om the student’s ask-_
ing that a stated fee of $10 for the
support of athletics be added to the
regular tuition fee of all under-
graduates, has been -refused by the
board of trustees on the ground that
it would be unwise to increase the
present tuitionfee, and that the pro-
posed system would tend toward uni-
versity control of athletics.

NEW, YORK UNIVERSITY.

 

Enrolment Is the Largest Recorded
for This Period.

Enrolment in New York University
is t'he largest for this period at any
time in its history. The faculty of
the Medical School has already ad-
mitted 195 to the entering class, this
being the limit of the laboratories.
This ‘is an increase of ﬁfty over last
year’s entering class. Classes in the.
School of Commerce, Accounts and
Finance are crowded to their limit. -

Enrolment in the entering class of
the Law School is nearly as large as
that of last year in spite of increased
requirements for the degree. The en-
tering class of the School of Applied
Science is‘ much larger than last‘year,
while the freshman class of the _col-
lege is about the sameas last year.
The enrolment in the collegiate .divis-
ion, the School of Pedagogy, and the
Graduate School is approximately the
same as that of the same period last
year. .

The faculty of the two schools at
University Heights has inaugurated a
new system. The period from 1:15 to
2:15 on Thursday afternoon is given

WELL Bnlnuctn TEAM PROMISES

PITT A BRTRLIANTSEASDN

Many Critics’ Think- This Year’s Team is as Strong as That
of 1910—Players in Good_Shape for Big Games
—Coach Thompson is Optimistic

 

Under the ‘tutelage of “Foxy Joe"
Thompson and the valiant leaders'hip
of Capt. Jack Lindsay, the-Pitt foot-
ball team is rapidly assuming the ma-
chine-like precision that characterized
last year's championship team. The
team is well balanced this year, pos-
sessing speed, aggressiveness and
judgment in the back ﬁeld, a set of
fast, nervy ends, and a line that has
weight and good ﬁghting spirit be-
tween the tackles. If dope counts for
anything, we have a team this year
that isthe equal of, if not superior to
the team that played such a wonder-
ful brand of football last year.

Capt. Lindsay is as game an end as
Pitt men ever boasted of, and is in
the conﬂict from the kick-off till the
last whistle blows. On the defense,
he tackles hard and surely, diagnoses
a play quickly and can be depended-
on to do the right thing at the right
time‘, He handles forward passes
well and knows how to keep his op-
ponent out of the play when Pitt’s,
backs circle his end. Of the other
ends, “Chuck” Soles has the edge, al-
though both Graves and Campbell
will put up a good game whenever‘
called upon. Soles has a lot to learn‘
but he learns quickly and will be ‘a
valuable man as he possesses grit,
strength ‘and medihm speed. ‘Blair
and Stevenson have played in. the
Pitt line for three years and have, be-
sides this experience, both speedand
weight. Ross Feightner and “Red’
Smith have the call at guards,'the
former having been on the 1909 squad,
while the latter entered the 1915 class
from Bellefonte Academy. Gehlert.
Pratt, Williams and Cummins are all
good men and can be depended on to
ﬁll up any vacancies between the
tackles. Gehlert has played in both
games to date and won his letter last
year. At center “Polly” Galvin is in
a class by himself, his wonderful de~
fensive powers, coupled with his punt-.
ing ability, make him the envy and
fear of Pitts’ opponents. Stevenson,
Feightner or Cummins can be shifted
t'o center should “Polly” be out of
the game.

The back ﬁeld is‘ run byi“Tillie”
Dewar, a fast, clever and heady gen-
eral.‘ “-Tillie” is particularly adept at
the new gameof football and seems
to know at all times just what"-play
to use?‘ -Connelly is a comer and will
probably, play in part of every game
this season. Of the halfbacks, Brown,
Quailey,'DiI1on and Kernohan show

up best. Br'own does his best work
in the big games where he is most
needed and shines most in tackle
backs and on the defense. Quailey
has been a substitute halfback. for
two years and his. playing has im-
proved-so much this year that he will
probably have the call to start the
game next Saturday. Dillon has
showed class in the past'two games,
especially in open ﬁeld running. He
is stronger on offensive work than
on the defense.‘ Kernohan has done
well in both the games so far and
will probably get a chance against
the Indians.
backﬁeld and has put up a splendid
game this year. “Hube” weighs about
190, but still is very fast. He is a’
hard man to stop and hurls the for-
ward pass with great accuracy. Leitch,
Davis, Kipp, Hemphiu, Markle and
others are doing well.

 

PITT PLAYS FIRST 9     
BIG GAME SATURDAY

 

Indian War Whoop Will Be Heard
at Forbes Field—Bad Weather
Expected.

 

The big games will be inaugurated,
here next‘Saturday’when Glenn S.
Warner’s braves representing the
Carlisle Indian School play "Pitt. The
Indians will arrive twenty-ﬁve
strong and seven of last year’s team
will play again this year. The seven
are Newashe, Jordan, Garlow, Burd,
Arcasa, '. VVheelock_ and Powell.
Thrope, a "star for many years on

the gridiron, has showed that he ‘can-»

“c'ome back” after missing two years,
and will play in his old- position at
halfback. 1

The Indians have won every game
this season, having defeated Dickin-
son, Georgetown and two other im-
portant colleges. Their large scores
have been due chieﬂy to their open
style of play which Coach Warner is
said to have perfected to a high de-
gree of efficiency.

The band will be on hand to keep.

on the, 5-yard line. Stump stopped
Wagner for no gain and Brown could
not make the distance, so lost the ball
on downs. -

Smith and Gardner gained 10 yards
on a forward pass. The same play

failed, so Smith punted to Dillon in

midﬁeld. Dillon fumbled, but- Lind-
say recovered. Wagner shot the bail
to Dewar for a 15-yard gain. Dillon
hurtled through the line for 5, but
Brown was unable to annex around
right end. Dewar handled Wagner's
pass in brilliant style and ran past
two men for_ a touchdown. Galvin
added one to the score, making it
11.0. ' . ‘

Dillon’s elusive footwork allowed
him to return. the kick-off 25 yards.
Wagner circled left end for 5 yards
and then kicked out of bounds to O.
N. iU.’s 40-yard line. Smith and Gal-
vin exchanged punts. The half ended

. here.

Galvin kicked to Brown of O. N.
U., who returned 5 yards. Pitt was
penalized 5 yards for offside. Smith
and Gardner again -tricked the Pitt
defense by a forward pass of 12 yards.
Smith and Galvin exchanged punts

‘and the opponents fumbled, Pitt re-

covering. Brown was tackled by
Gardner and Stump and had his
jersey torn off. On the next lineup
Wagner and Dewar again executed a
forward pass and the latter romped
over four lines for a touchdown, Gal-
vin again missed goal, an unusual
thing for ‘.‘Polly” t‘o do twice in a
game. Score 16-0. '

In. «the fourth quarter Cummins
took Gehlert’s place, Campbell went
in for Soles, Graves. for Lindsay,
Kernohan for Dillon, Connelly for
Dewar, Qualiey for Brown, and Wil-
liams for Smith. These men all put

Chancellor McCormick’s remark
about the latest student organization
was, “The band is.ﬁne——ﬁne!”

FOOTBALL DOPE

When Manager Hurst saw Brown
emerge from a scrimmage without
even a shred of a jersey on his back,
he growled to" himself: “Another
two dollars gone to the bad!”

Some of us were treated to a part
of Glenn S. .Warnef’s “line of talk”
two years ago after his defeat at Pitt’:
hands and we hope to be in a posi-
tion to hear the remainder this year.
A number of rooters gave him three
times three after the game and he
misinterpreted t'he spirit in which it
was given. He didn’t act very nice.

Charlie Quailey always has a good
word for his fellow players. This is
theeright spirit and he is deservedly
popular. I ,

“Cluster round me, fellows.” Ques-
tion, who said this in the last game?”

Pitt’s record 1910
started, 327-0.

A clipping from the Boston Globe:
“University of Pittsburgh practices
on the National League baseball
grounds, where the gridiron is a bet-
ter one than any other Eastern col-
lege has, except where the ﬁeld is
owned by the college itself.”

Blair wrenched his left shoulder in
the Westminster game and for this
reason was not used against O. N. U.
He will undoubtedly play against the
Indians, however, and his former ex
periences with them will be of’ great
service as he now knows their style
of play. i

A special grand stand entrance will
be reserved for students having a pink
b'ook. This will save them the trou-
ble of going through the student en-
trance and exchanging their tickets
inside the gates.

NEW COURSE STARTED.

The School of Economics has re-
cently instituted a new course, which
is attracting the attention of all- per-
sons interested in sociological and
economic investigation. A class has
been started which will investigate
the cost of living. In several of" the
large cities of this country and of
Europe investigations have been made
along this line. The University now
intends to secure through its students
and others‘ interested sufficient data
to enable its students to understand
th'oroughly the situation in Pitts-
burgh. T A -

The,twork will be done in conjunc-
tion with the various civic bodies of
the city interested in such lines of in-
vestigation. According to many lead-
ers in this form of ‘economic work,
opportunities are to be found in this
district which do not exist ,_in any
other city in this country. The Uni-
versity is endeavoriing to make this
investigation V as thorough-going and
painstaking as possible. Although
Dr. Holdsworth, Dean of the" Eco-
n’omics School, will supervise the
course, it will be underthe direct
management of Dr. Crafer and Mr.
John 'O’Conner. '

MASS MEETING BIG SUCCESS

New Song Makes Hit at Big Rooters’
Meeting.

The mass meeting held in chapel
last Friday for cheer practice. was full
of Pitt’s spirit. The chapel was ﬁlled
to overﬂowing and the way the fel-
lows responded to Cheer Leader
Kirk’s efforts was very gratifying to
the cheer leader. ‘-Keep the good
work up, fellows. Don’t let the cheer
leader get blue in the face trying to
get a noise out of you. Wake up, and
make Dr. Bishop go back on his word
when he saidlthat Pitt’s spirit was
strong on the outside but weak on
the inside. We want _it both ways.
Our cheering was better last year
than ever before—'-—make it still better
this year. The new song, printed be-
l'ow, was presented by the cheer
leader. It‘ was well received. Get
in on it at once:

T‘hey’ll never get over it again for
months and months and months;

They'll never get over it ‘again’ for
months and months and months.

The teams we play from day to day

We will defeat——Hoor‘ay!

And‘ they’ll never get ‘over it again for
months and months and months.

Old W. & J. will ‘be.l;_iard. up for
months. and months and months.

Old Aw. & Jfwill be hard up. for

months and months and months.

We’ll cross their line—we’l'l beat them

again; We’ll get their goat,
And they’ll never get over it again for
months and months and months,

And they’ll never get over it again for
months and months and months.

OldlPenn State will meet her fate
against the Blue and Gold,

And they’ll never get over it again for
months and months and months,

And they’ll never get over it again for

months and months and months.

The Big Red team may be all right,
but Pitt will win the ﬁght;

And they'll never get over it again for

And they’ll never get over it again for
