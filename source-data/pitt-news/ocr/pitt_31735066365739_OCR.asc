by BILL GORMLEY
Editor

The "Litchfield_Papers_" tell
a tragic tale of a shattered
dream — Edward Litchfield’s

of Pittsburgh "one of the great

- universities of the world."

The culprits in the tale are Pitt's
Board of Trustees and the Mellon/
dynasty. ‘

William Rodd. author of‘ the
document, indicts the Board of
Trustees for being "inactive and
ineffectual" as Pitt’s financial
problems worsened during the
early 1960‘s. -

He also charges that the Mellon
family "Led Litchfield up the prim-

rose path.” Rodd concludes that

Richard King Mellon, head of the
family. apparently “was never in-
terested in‘ Pitt's becoming. a
great school."

While Rodd‘s article is mislead-
ing in several important respects.
theidocuments sympathetic por-
trayal of Litchfield is substantial-
ly accurate.

Though Litchfield was guilty of
excessive optimism, he was egged
on -by members of the Board of
Trustees who applauded his clar-
ion call to greatness but failed to
raise the money to make it a real-
ity.

A brilliant and versatile man.
Litchfield came to Pitt in 1956
only after the Board of Trustees

assured him they understood his,
transformation of the University»

would cost a great deal of money.

Upon his
stressed that his plans would re-
quire a $125 million increase in
the University’s endowment. Ac-
cording to a.1956 Saturday Eve-

arrival, 'Litchfield’

ningi Pgst article. the Trustees _A

were so starry-eyed over Litch-
field "that,they didn‘t even "blink“
at the figure.
LITCHFIELD’S QPTIMISM

As Rodd points out, Litchfield
had several good reasons for be-
lieving the Board would raise the
money needed to make Pitt one of
the world's great universities:

1) The Chairman of the Board
was Alan Magee Scaife, a wealthy
industrialist and husband of Sar-
ah Mellon. The Scaifes, whose
son, Richard Mellon Scaife, at-
tended Pitt, were strong support-
‘ers of the University.

2) Another memberiof the Board
was Richard, King Mellon. Scaife‘s
brother-in-law and the head of
America’s wealthiest family.

i Richard's father had been a long-

time Pitt trustee and his grand-
father\had attended Pitt.

Richard King Mellon and Mayor

:4)/‘Most of Pitt's Trustees were
independently wealthy. with an-
nual incomes ranging from $250.-

000 to $10 million.

Thus, Litchfield’s optimism was not

. unfounded. He hvadlample reason

to "believe that Pittsburgh’s busi-»

ness community would be gener-
ous toward Pitt.
However. Rodd's analysis is
deficient in severalrespects.
MEASURING GENEROSITY
Firstof all. there are degrees
of gener_osity.- _
gr "I think the business commun-
ity would be shocked if anyone ac-
cused "them of not supporting Pitt

Montgomery. who served under.
Litchfield as Director of Person-
' nel and Directorof the Budget.

"But when you’re talking about
$125 -million." Montgomery em-
phasizes. "that just doesn’t hap-
pen." ‘

Joseph Colangelo, who served
as Litchfield’s Public Relations
Director in 1965, recalls that
Litchfield consistently o‘veresti-’
mated the generosity of Pitts-_

‘ .burgh philanthropists when an-

ticipating

income for a fiscal
year. ‘

In short. thebusiness commun-.
~ity‘s contributions fell short of
Litchfield’s expectations. but that

' doesn‘t mean that the business ,
community wasn’t generous. Fur— ,

thermore, it must be admitted‘
that Litchfield did some bad
guessing. I ..
PROMISES, PROMISES .
Second, there is a difference be-

tween an expression of support -

and a firm promise.

Rodd’s unattributed quotes not-
withstanding, Litchfield does not
appear to have been promised
$125 million by the Board‘. ‘ A

At staff meetings, Montgomery

recalls. Litchfield stressed that 

he had been- promised. nothing.
though he expected to receive the
money he needed: "Edtasserted
that no promise was ‘ever made

Directors ohay booking thieves

The Book Center Board of Di-
rectors, Thursday approved a pro-
posal calling" for the referral to

var. apprehended student. faculty.

ment offrom five-90 days. or both. _

The proposal also calls for pro-
mulgation of the policy in the
Student Handbook and via signs
prominently displayed in the Book
Center. and the assurance that

each case. will be dealt with in-'

dividually.

.The 12-member Board passed
the proposal with only one dissent-
ing vote.

Dean of Student Affairs Dr. Al-
fred Moye. who ‘authored the pro-
posal.,said_ that the present meth-
od of dealing with student thieves.
sendingthem to his’ office for dis-
ciplinary action. has not been ef-
fective. ,

“A counseling-centered‘ ap-
proachlto theft may be effective
in a small rural college,” he said,

. “but it creates a real problem in
. an urban institution such as Pitt
.where the Book Center is public.-

"Itis also." he added; “a pro-
tective function left over from the
concept of in Iocoiparentis-—a Con-
cept we have dismissed with're-
gard to almost all other regula-
tions."

WHAT MAKES PITT
STUDENTS SPECIAL?
Bookstores at Penn State and
the University of Oregon recent-
ly began turning over apprehend-
ed thieves to civil authorities and

successfully reduced shoplifting.

Student Director" Dennis Con-
cilla. who voted for the proposal.
said itmight help deter thieves at
the Book Center. who last year
walked off with about $40.000
worth of merchandise.

“The idea of this policy,” he
said, “is not what do we do with

people caught stealing books. The ,

idea is to prevent them from
stealing books.”

"What makes a Pitt student. so
special?" askeggConcilla.“t"A» jun-

Director.William Brown. associ-

for the proposal, said that experi- _

ence has contradicted this idea.

“The only people we have ever
apprehended offered to pay im-
mediately." he said. "thus indi-
cating no need.“

“A great deal of this,” agreed
Director Robert Colodny, “is done
for kicks, just as a kind of dare-
devil ‘rip if off’; it has to be stop-
ped, and I don’t'know what thehell
else to do_.”

Colodny. professor of his-
tory.who was not present for the
vote. termed Book Center thiev-'

shoplifters threaten a service of
the entire University community.

Lawson also lamented the lack

of an official University-wide po-p

licy on campus crime. .
"I could steal a whole shelf of
booksfrom the library," he said,
"and nothing would happen then."
According to Brown, the Board
will also suggest to the Chancellor

that uniform policy on campusai

crime be developed.

Moye did not rule out use of

the Campus Judiciary at a later  I I ,
date, but currently. he said, since

But were he writing the re-

Frank Denton.

the Board made no firm promise
todo so.

THE MONOLITH MYTH
Third. the Mellon family is not
a monolithic unit. ‘

In his article. Rodd falls into
the trap of referring to “the Mel-
lons" as if there exists such an
entity.

The fact of the matter is that
Alan Scaife and Richard King
Mellon were two distinct individ-
uals.

When Alan Scaife died in 1958,
many hoped that Richard King
Mellon would pick up thetorch
and exhibit the same strong com-
mitment to Pitt. '

But Mellon never indicated,that
he would pick up the torch. In-
deed. when asked to succeed
Scaife as Pitt Board Chairman.
Mellon declined (age may-have
been a factor in this decision).

Litchfield had every right to

hope that Mellon’s commitment to ~

Pitt would prove as strong as
Scaife‘s, but he had no right to
expect that Mellon’s preferences
would coincide with those of his
deceased brother-in-law. ‘
Moreover. if Scaife made a de-
facto commitment to Litchfield,
Mellon was not obliged to keep it.
“Whatever Scaife may have said
to Litchfield." one observer notes,

"there was no need for it to carry-

forward to anyone else."
Nevertheless, Rodd’s conte:n-

tion that.Mellon “never was inter-
ested in Pitt’s becoming a great
school” appears in the literal
sense to be correct.

Mellon’s support was substan-
tial, but not substantial enough t’

Thus. Mellon can be faulted for
failing to put the finishing touch
on the Pittsburgh "Renaissance."

"Since World War II.” Mont-
gomery comments. “Mellon was
committed to making Pittsburgh

' as great a community as possible.

If one accepts the postulate that
a great community depends on a
great University. Mellon should

have been doing everything he;

could to make Pitt a great Univer-
sity. He should have picked up
the torch.”

Rodd errs, then, in fuzzing the
line between what the Mellons
should have done, in the eyes of
those who hoped to see Pitt a
great University, and what the
Mellons were obligated to do.‘

Rodd comes close to the truth,
though. in his discussion of the in-
eptness of the Board of Trustees
during the worst financial crisis
in the University’s history.

TRUSTEE PARALYSIS ; ,

Rodd paints a convincing por-
trait of Trusteesiwho were fas-
cinated by Litchfi'eld’s vision but
who refused to take decisive ac-
tion toimplement it. Frank Den-
ton, Gwilym Price, and Leon Falk
appear to fit this description.

According to Rodd, Price refus-
ed to ask Pittsburgh’s corporate

magnates to bail the University 

‘out when Pitt.found,itself in trou-

bled fiscal waters.in the early,

"60’s. “Don‘t expect me to go to
the 39th floor for‘ you," Price re-
portedly told Litchfield. referring
to the floor of the U.S. Steel Build-
ing which housed the offices of
Pittsburgh’s wealthiest. including
R. K..Mellon. ‘ P ‘
Frank Dcnton, Vice Chairman

of Mellon Bank and Mellon’s close_

»}«.,
I

aide, was in ‘a particularly good ‘

position to approach, Mellon, but
he also refgsed. “My job is to

-make money, not to spend it,”

Denton is said to have retorted.

‘ And Leon Falk. whochaired a
fund-raising committee of the
Board of Trustees. allowed the

E committee, in Rodd’s words. to

go "from limbo to utter oblivion."
Resigning from the committee in
1963, Falk urged Litchfield that
yearto "wait a year“ before pur-
suing ‘a capital funds campaign
outside the health area. .

In the final analysis, Rodd‘s con-
clusion appears correct: I the
Board proved "inactive and in-
effectual." __ ’

SLEEPING WATCHDOGS

All along, the Board had two op,-
tions—to secure the money Litch-
field needed or to reject his bud-
getary proposals.

Abdicating both its “watchdog”
function and its “fund-raising”
function, the Board failed to fore-
see how ‘desperate Pitt"s financial
plight was becoming. A

Worst of allfsome Board mem-
bers contributed a mere pittance
to the University in the middle of
its darkest hour.

on the average to Pitt. Incredibly

enough. six of the 15 actually gave

nothing during this critical per-

CLEARING THE AIR

The “Litchfield Papers” appar-
ently do not reveal any new facts,
but they do contribute an impor-
tant perspective on the events
from 1956 to 1965.

Before his resignation as Chan-

cellor in 1965, Edward Litchfield '

had been vilified by the media
and had become a public scape-
goat. -
“Everybody was tearing at his
throat,” Montgomery recalls,
adding that “the media did not at-

tack the Mellons and they didn’t

have much sympathy. for Litch-
field.” ' » A

To the extent that .Rodd’s docu-
ment clears the reputation of a

great man who did‘wonders for I
' titudinal colorin'g,‘*'the“‘I3itchfield

the University, it is valuable.

. . SHARING THE BLAME \
The “Litchfield Papers” are
also important because they shed
light on the weaknesses of the
Board of Trustees and the capri-
ciousness of . Pittsburgh’s finan-
cial establishment, both of which

It‘ is clear that the Board of ‘ii

n‘Tru_,stees failed to take prompt

‘ and effective action to save Pitt

from financial chaos, either by

raising the necessary funds or by , 
his :-

telling Litchfield to temper
hopes. ‘ »

And it is also clear that the Mel-

lon family’s support for Pitt has". 

.been substantial but not substan-
_ tial enough to make Pitt a great
university. ‘

Most importantly, the “Litch-, I
field Papers" have recaptured the

brilliance and exuberance of the
Litchfield era, during which the

University took unparalleled  -if

‘ strides toward excellence.
Speaking of Litchfield, Edison
Montgomery notes that “he did
. turn the University around, though

at the price of financial discom-   .

Despite some misleading pass-
ages/ and some overly strong at-

ward Litchfield’s extraordinary

contributions to the University- 
and the dream that almost suc-,  " ~

In this sense, they are valuable _  

indeed.

fAmnesty more complex than portrayed I

Editor: . _
 I-am writing in reference to theggeneral draft_
n  amnesty article by Jim Wasylik in the February 14 ,
' - issue of the Pitt News. Reading the article. I
n ‘noticed several statements that were either in--
. complete or altogether wrong. --

The article also failed to bring out a very irri-
portant-and one of’ the more complex problems
of an amnesty. Of the 70,000 men in exile or
prison. there are very few who feel that they
have done "anything wrong. The great maj_ori_ty
feel that a sincere effort of amnesty by the feder-
al government must be a “mea culpa" from _a
guilty government. a sort of official act of contri-
tion for the war. ’

One could get a more complete view of this
immense problem by reading the cover story for
Newsweek magazine of January 17. If the amnesty
does not include such a statement of guilt by the
government, there is a chance that very few of the
exiles will accept the amnesty.

Another important question therefore arises.
How does a government make such an. admit-
tance of error? ‘

It is my feeling that an article of less than
1.000 words can hardly begin to scratch the sur-
face of complexities involved in the problem of.
amnesty.

Your article has given the reader a much too
limited picture of the problem and -the saying

-l The Litchfield Papers

The Pitt News has edited the so-called “Litchfield Pa-
pers” and is publishing a version in today's edition.

The document, written by William Rodd in l966,
deals with the period from 1956-1965 when the late
Edward Litchfield served as Chancellor of the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh. '

A substantially unexpurgated versionsof the docu-
ment appeared in Friday's Pittsburgh Forum, after Judge
Richard Wentley of the Court of Common Pleas revoked a
restraining order enjoining the Forum from publishing the
“Papers.”

Under the terms of an agreement reached out of court,
.ne Forum “prominently displayed” a statement by Litch-
field’s heirs in the same issue containing the “Litchfield
Papers.” '

In their statement, the heirs asserted that Litchfield
. \
“found the completed document to be both inaccurate and

, misleading, and he, therefore, decided not to have it pub-

lished.”

The Litchfield heirs also declared that the document
“is entirely the. work of Mr. Rodd, and does not accurately
express the views of our father, Edwad H. Litchfield.”

According to Rodd, Litchfield was“in substantial part
responsible for the content” of the document. ’

In a Pitt News interview, Rodd declared that Litchfield
asked him to write the document and assisted him through-
out his research and writing. Rodd also indicated that Litch-
field subsidized him for producing the document.

by WILLIAM Rooo

Ten years ago Pittsburgh’s power structure—heart-
ened by the success of a Renaissance which spectacu-
larly cleaned the skies, dammed flooding rivers, gird-
ed the hills with fast-moving freeways,‘ and replaced
cluttered railroad yards with silver skyscrapers—launch-

ed a program “to make the University of Pittsburgh

one of the world's foremost universities.”

Alan Scaife, brother-in-law of Richard King Mel-
lon, senior member of the 2.5 billion dollar Mellon
clan, was Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the
University of Pittsburgh (Pitt). He enunciated their
intention: A

"Pitt will seek to find a distinctive national role '
and support this role with large and uncommitted en-
dowments.”

Mr. Scaife added:

“We are fully aware of all this will require and
we intend to provide it.” I '

The man chosen by the Board to implement their
goals as the new Chancellor was dynamic, young Ed-
ward H. Litchfield, dean of Cornell’s Graduate School
of Business and Public Administration. . »

Litchfield looked at the tremendous wealth and
power "vested in the Mellon family and enthusiastical-
ly told Scaife, “This will be one of the greatest ad-
ventures in education since Rockefeller endowed the
University of Chicago.” No one contradicted him.

Now, ten years later, Pitt has achieved many of
its goals. It has gained an academic excellence. attract-
ing outstanding faculty and higher quality students.
Noted as an innovator of regional, national, and inter-
national programs, it has attracted major foundation
support, and is among the top 25 schoolsin the coun-

, try in government-supported research. Its operating

budget has grown from $13 million to $49'million. Its
faculty from 561 to 1,091. Its physical plant from $32
million to more than $120 million. A

_But its endowment, initially projected to/‘reach
$125 million—later upped to $200 million—has fallen far
short of the goal, growing. only from $30 million to
$61.3 million. Of that, a mere $12.5 million is_ in um

, restricted funds.

Last year the Pittsburgh power structure. after an

acrimonious airing of a purportedly disastrous accu-

mulated budget deficit of $19 million. dumped Pitt
and abandoned Litchfield.

A The wealthiest Board of Trustees in the country
went hat-in-hand to the State. pleading poverty. and

threatening to close the school doors. Gone are their

goals of excellence and aspirations for a national repu-
tation. This. at a time when they and Pittsburgh were
enjoying an economic boom which had-doubled pri-
vate and corporate incomes. '
Pitt is to become a State-related university with

lowered admission standards and lowered tuition rates

which discriminate against out-of-state students. . .

Pitt, in short, is to revert to its old status as a
second rate streetcar college, the only difference be-
ing that this time the taxpayers will foot the bill. _

It will take time, of course. The gains of the past
ten years will not vanish overnight. But the picture
is clear. A potentially great university has been para-

" .. l_vzed by the power structure. that ten years ago initi-

ated its climb to professional and academic excellence. . .
. THE SMOKY CITY ' A
A ‘To understandwwhat happened to Pitt it is neces-

Following’World ‘War II, Pittsburgh fell back into
its normal boom-and-bust pattern—common to a blue-
collar. nuts. and bolts. one-indust_rv area. As th_e U.S.
economy lagged, in the middle fifties and early six-
ties, Pittsburgh limped . . . .

A BRIGHTER FUTURE

Pittsburgh was a dying city. And its very decay. .

physically and industrially, engendered an enormous
effort for revival. The wonder drug was, initially, a
smoke abatement program, followed by massive doses
of slum clearance, new building, damming of its
three rivers.

The doctors were two Irishmen—-David Leo Law-
rence and Richard King Mellon.

The Pittsburgh power elite, led by R. K. Mellon,
head of America’s wealthiest family, included seven
out of twenty of the richest men in the United States,
according to Fortune.

Lawrence and Mellon‘ fomented an "environ-

mental revolution" and for the first time in Pittsburgh's ’

history, the entire community made common cause . . .
Mellon marshalied the gigantic industries in which

A he had a controlling or "strongly influential interest—

Gulf Oil, Koppers, Alcoa, Pittsburgh Plate Glass,
United States Steel, Pennsylvania Railroad, and the
-family Mellon Bank, twelfth largest in the country. . .

Laws for industry,.with $25,000 fines, were passed
and implemented. The mills installed smoke-control
devices. The public changed their furnaces. The skies
began to clear. . . ‘

THE ALLEGHENY CONFERENCE

Concurrent with smoke control was the tearing
down of antiquated buildings and the creation of mo-
dern structures in -the downtown business section . .

Vehicle for. change was the Allegheny Confer-
ence for Community Development, initially located
on the 39th floor of the U. S. Steel—Mellon.Bank
Building. Other tenants of the 39th floor included six
Mellon family foundations.

Members of the Conference represented probably
the largest coalition of wealth and power ever as-
sembled.in any one city. Most of them were members
of the highly restricted Duquesne and Harvard-Yale-
Princeton clubs, located at angles crossing Mellon
Park from the 39th floor to form another Golden Tri-
angle.

_. Many of the Conference members were later to
serve on the Board of Trustees of the University of
Pittsburgh. The present Pitt Board includes the presi-

,dents or'top executives of Allegheny Ludlum Steel,

Pittsburgh Plate Glass, Alcoa, U.S. Steel, Oliver Ty-
rone Corporation, T. Mellon & Sons, Consolidation
Coal Company, Westinghouse Electric, Pennsyl-
vania Railroad Company, and Gulf Oil Corporation.
In the aggregate they represent over fifty-five billion
dollars of corporate assets. - '

ART, INDUSTRY, and EDUCATION

The Renaissance was not alone smoke clear-
ance, skyscrapers and~parkways—plotted by finance
and industry. It was also a concern with the quality
of life. . .Industry was last to catch fire .

Industry. too. had long known. as it still knows
today. that essential basic research is to be found at
its best in the universities. But no Pittsburgh univer-
sity was equipped to utilize the more sophisticated
approach of modern technology. ‘-

Pitt was being -built up, however, in the ‘health
areas. The Mellons, long interested in medicine, fo-

. cused on a medical school and laid the groundwork

for a major public health school. . .
NEEDED: A GREAT UNIVERSITY
With Pittsburgh achieving new grandeur and the

» beauty of its hills and rivers revealed, hope emerged

that other critically important changes were possible.

J. Steele Gow. director of the Falk Foundation.
had long fostered programs in social work and educa-
tion. Now, he felt the time was ripe for a major rev-
olution in education. .

Industry desperately needed a strong research-ori-
ented university. The growing medical school and
hospital complex needed’ the support of a major uni-
versity.

Pitt, chartered in 1787. seemed the natural choice
for the build—up. . .

Gow thought the Mellons would be hospitable to

the idea of strengthening Pitt. The community had .

long considered_ Pitt as a Mellon family trust. Thomas
Mellon. patriarch and founder of the dynasty. attend-
ed Pitt as did Andrew W. Mellon.

Richard Beatty Mellon,_father of ‘Richard King,
had been a long-time trustee. A. W. Mellon had given
the land for the major Oakland campus. Young Rich-
ard Mellon Scaife was a student there. His father.
Alan Scaife; husband of Sarah Mellone; was chairman
of the Board of Trustees. ' " *

sionals. The majority of the alumni had worked their

way through school. Many were bitter about the low,
caliber of teaching and the lack of student aid. Alumni 7
giving was a pittance—with 40,000 alumni———1954 contri-

butions totaled $10,882. . .
GENESIS OF THE NEW PITT

The first step to improve Pitt was taken. by
Steele Gow who went to Leon Falk, a millionaire j"

industrialist. .. s

Falk was enthusiastic‘ about the possibility of-up-
grading Pitt and providing the community with a first-
rate university. He went to Pitt's Board Chairman.

- Alan Scaife . . .

EDWARD H. ALITCHFIELD

In the decade to come, the $12.5 million given to A

Pitt for enrichment of the Humanities by the A.W.'

Mellon Educational and Charitable Trust (the small- 
est of the several trusts Paul controls), was to be the A ' A

most significant Mellon backing of Pitt, except in the
health areas. _ '

Editor's Note: The A. W. Mellon Educationaland.  ~ --
Charitable Trust was not “controlled"by Paul Mellon; I 
The late Richard King Mellon also sat on -the Trust's 

board ‘

Within the Mellon clan, the dark, intent. courte-
ous'Adolph Schmidt is probably the person with the

most intelligent concern and understanding of educa- .

tional needs and social problems. . .«
PLANS FOR PITT

With the backing of Schmidt, the team of Scaife, I

Falk and Gow went ahead with their plans. They de-

cided to make Pitt “one of the great universities of the ~_ I

world" and they announced plans for amulti-million

dollar development program. Scaife said, "We must- i‘ i

provide resources as ample as our purpose."

The man they selected to foster their hopes wash
Edward Harold Litchfield, Dean of the then newly-

organized Cornell Graduat_e School of Business , A 
Public Administration. Prior to coming to Pitt as its‘ ‘

12th Chancellor, Litchfield held many conferences

with Board members. In correspondence with Scaife A  =1

and Falk hesought to define the goals, and estabiisii
the commitment of thecommunity. “This will take. a
great deal of money,” he alerted the Trustees.

V “The money will be forthcoming,” they assured .
1 him, and they agreed in an early Board meeting that

“endowment would need to be increased to a total of
125 million dollars” and that other developments com-

Two, further development of the University ‘en-
dowments to support the goal of ‘achieving a distinc-
tive national role in meeting educational problems.

Writing to Scaife, from Cornell, Litchfield warn-
ed, “To be successful such development must enlists

the Faculty, the Chancellor, and the community which
the University serves . . .

MEN OF MANY PARTS

The new Chancellor received his doctorate in po-
litical science at the University of Michigan. He had
served as deputy director of personnel for the State of
Michigan. taught at Brown and Michigan and served
in the Canal Zone as a personnel training specialist.

When Litchfield was 31. General Lucitus D.
Clay ‘called him to Germany to assist in the political
reconstruction of that occupied country. He rose from
a special assistant to director of all U. S. programs
in political reorganization, denazification. refugee
and displaced persons, public health and safety. and
the largest part of civil affairs of the Occupation.

On his return to the States. Litchfield f'ounded
the Governmental Affairs Institute (today the State
Departments principal host for hundreds of major
foreign political leaders coming here annuallyt.
He also became the first Executive Director of the
American Political Science Association. and then
Dean of Cornell's Graduate School of Business and
Public Administration. __    i __

While at Pitt. Litchfield has also served. for the
past ten years, as Chairman of the Board of Smith-
Corona-Marchant Corporation. Under his leadership

SCM has grown from a producer of typewriters to-

a multi-product office equipment producer with new
plants. a young and aggressive management. a strong
board. and with sales many times those of 1956. He
has also been an active director inmany other cor-

. porations. . .

Litchfield is a man of many parts. He often seems
to-be-'cut from the same die as McGeorge Bundy and

1 Robert McNamara:—brilliantly articulate. witha quick

grasp of the core of a problem and with the ability to
correlate complicated concepts». While he is a bold
and daring thinker.,his tone of voice and manner are
quiet. assured, conservative. He has a blue—eyed. sandy-
haired crisp English appearance. Although of medium
stature, he became known to his compeers at Pitt as
"Big Ed" because of his tough. incisive mind and
his forceful actions.

He was also to surprise the faculty and trustees
by his passion for ideas and ideals (a passion infre-
quently associated with administrators). He was to
constantly foster, sometimes at the expenseof budget.
people and programs, which would in John Gardner's
words: "equip the individual for the never-ending pro-
cess of learning  . gird his mind and spirit . . . in-
still the attitudes toward growth and learning and

’ I creativity which will in turn shape society."

To his new chore at Pitt. Litchfield brought a
philosophy that a. university could be managed with

‘ , the same effectiveness and in a similar administrative

manner as a business or government with an effect

superior to the old "muddle-through" processes of aca-

demia.

He also brought with him. though he didn't ex-
pect to need it. -a _Keynsian theory of economics-
of deficit spending—the theory which has currently
brought the U.S.to its highest economic peak. . .

PITT BEGINS TO MOVE '

Litchfield arrived at Pitt in 1956.eager to take

advantage of the psychological momentum sparked by
' the Trustees‘ announcement of Pitt‘s goals. And. he

was’ far more urgently aware than most men. includ-
ing his Board. that as science transformed our society.

" the importance of education would take a quantum

jump for everyone involved.

He knew that Pittsburgh‘s prosperity depended .

in the long run upon the emergence of a great univer-
sity which. allied with industry and government.

students and Pitt's firstoperative Student Ifnion. . .

When Litchfield arrived. almost no one was com-
muting—4b_v trolly or 0therwise——from other countries.
Today there are 400 students from foreign countries
plus 100 faculty members.

Admission standards were raised considerably, at-
tracting the better high school students. Student aid
soared from near zero to $3‘/2 million by 1965. (The
1965 deficit, which the Mellons later harped on as
pauperizing Pitt, was—at one reckon_ing—$3'/2 million).
With a stronger faculty and imaginative programs, the
number of graduate and professional students increas-
ed by 60 percent. By design, the 1955 enrollment of
17,000 was maintained. . . . '

With the aid of the $12.5 million A. W. Mellon
Educational & Charitable Fund gift. academically dis-
tinguished Mellon professors were brought in. both
visiting and permanent. ’I‘hey came from Oxford. from
the Sorbonne. from he Ivy League. George Murdock
came from Yale. bringing with him the’ renowned
Cross-Cultural files. and helping_to create from scratch
what became an outstanding anthropology department.

Adolf Grunbaum came to establish a vigorous
new area. Philosophy of Science. There was subse-
quently an exodus of some of the best people in the
field from Yale and Princteon to -join Gru.nbaum at
Pitt. '

The brilliant new faculty was to react violently
against a Ford Foundation Report in 1966 which stig-
gested Pitt lower its standards. sayimg that excellence

responsible for Pitt’s financial woes. The Report point-
ed out: A grant of $5 million could have been re-
quested to have tided the program over its rocky

' Editor's Note: According to Edison Montgomery, the

Ford Foundation Report was in error. Contrary to the re- '

port, the Trimester Program was not partially responsible
for Pitt’s financial problems. “The Trimester Program was
a money-maker and still is,” Montgomery notes.

bernetic society.

Pitt was plant poor—there were no dormitories or
computers. Even the vaunted Cathedral was a rabbit-
warren of raw lath-and-plaster stories which were to
eat up many millions of plant funds in the years to
come. With a few notable exceptions, the caliber of

=both students and faculty was low. Salaries were mea-

ger.

With the approval of the Board, Litchfield raised
_both the standards and salaries of the faculty. A fa-

-culty evaluation board weeded out the inept, spurred

to greater achievement border-line cases, so that from
1956 to 1965—the number of Ph.D’s grew from 40 per-

cent to 84 percent. Salaries grew on an average from

$7,000 to $12,000; the student-faculty ratio went from

:12-1 to less than 8-1.

The Report also failed to mention that a Ford"
pamphlet on Year-Round Education praised Pitt‘s pio-
neering effort. the Trimester Plan. which is now in
use by 55 schools and is being seriously considered for
the New York high school system. . .

There was an early concern for the needs of _the
underprivileged. In 1958 a program was established
with Schenley High. a nearby. mainly Negro school.
to bring in able seniors for selected classes. such as
English. Chemistry. etc.

In 1963. during a Convocation speech. Litchfield
proposed the University commit itself to an action pro-.
gram to save "undeveloped resources at home.“ These
were Negroes. women. and the youths whose poten-
tial was wasted due to inadequate high school counsel-
mg.

‘ He. further proposed a domestic Education Corps.’
; on the Fed_e_ral level. and a ‘Presidentigal. Commission -

 

. _f.und-r-aisingresponsibilities, 1.

  

to delineate programs of action. . .

Reflecting Pitt's involvement nationally was the
growth of sponsored research programs from $3 mil-
lion in 1956 to $10 million in 1965. Several of the pro-

grams in the Natural Sciences are among the best in‘

the world. among them those in plasma physics and
astrophycics.
PHYSICAL PLANT GROWS

Concomitant with Pitt's growth in stature was
a necessary corresponding increase in physical plant
which grew from $32 million in 1955 to more than $175
million in 1965 including facilities in process.

The development of the physical plant was pro-
posed and endorsed by the Trustees during a June,
1958 full Board meeting chaired by Alan Scaife.
Scaife died the next month following a study trip he
made to Russia with a group headed by Litchfield, and
was unable to announce Pitt’s major plans——plans which
subsequently were to be carried out in the main, and
highly criticized in part.

In August 1958. with the approval of the Board.
Litchfield announced:

A multi—million dollar expansion program for
Pitt. which would. in effect. be private slum-clearance.
Like many schools. Pitts "campus" was interlarded

The University was prohibited by
fund-raising efforts to secure unr.

and surrounded by cheap. honky-tonk type small bus-
inesses. bars. and substandard housing. The new plans
would create an integrated. grassy campus, reaching
to Tech. and linking up with Carnegie Institute and
Library and the entire Oakland cultural center. . .

One reason for optimism on the part of both Litch-
field and the Trustees that funds would be forthcoming
for development of the physical plant was the willing-
ness of new-Governor Lawrence’s Democratic State
administration in Harrisburg to assist schools in their
building programs through General State Authority

loans, which every two years would be amortised by

the Commonwealth. (This system was to be drastically
attacked by Republican Scranton when he became

Governor in 1962. After that, to a large_ extent, Pitt’s

plant» development was stalemated.)
PIRATE FANS PROTEST

When the Pitt plans were announced in 1953.

howls of enguish went up from sports—minded .

elements of the community because an initial step in
the plan was the leveling of Forbes Field. home of
the Pittsburgh Pirates*and Steelers. From that time.
any announcement of new land acquisition for Pitt

. met -considerable antagonism and cries that another

property was being taken off the tax rolls_. . .
NEW CHAIRMAN—NEW, CRITICISM

For a year. following the death of Alan Scaife.
the Board of Trustees was without a chairman. Litch-
field asked Richard K. Mellon to take the responsi-
bility. He declined. Finally. Gwilym Price. titular
Board Chairman of Westinghouse. was given the job.
His first statement startled Litchfield. “Don’t expect
me to go to the 39th floor for you."

During the hiatus in board leadership. the Pitts-
burgh Press began a sniping, job on Pitt and Litch-
field. whom it had correctly assessed as one and the
same. in the public mind. It never stopped hammering
at Pitt’s real-estate ‘,‘takeover“ of Oakland, and even
went so far as to do a McCarthy-like axe job on a
i\l\ISt0I‘_\‘ professor who had fought in the Spanish Civil

ar. .

The repercussions of the "Colodny Case" were
great. Screams of "Communist" went up from State
legislators. and they threatened to withdraw both GSA
money and Commonwealth appropriations which from

the time of Ben Franklin. have been given to Pennsy'l- -

vania private schools, including the University of Penn-

. sylvania,DrexelInstitute.and Temple. . «

Litchfield set up a committee of prominent people,
backed with attorneys and investigators, to thoroughly
explore the situation. After several months the commit-
tee reported that there were no basis of charges of
disloyalty. Litchfield announced his decision not to
dismiss Professor Colodny in a stirring statement on
academic freedom which probably endeared him more
to the liberal academic community than any other
single thing he did while Pitt’s Chancellor. . .

1959 PROGRESS REPORT—MELLON APPROVES '. ,

In September ‘-59, Litchfield reviewed Pitt’s
progress during a Fall Convocation message. . . 0

He reviewed the major accomplishments and out-
lin_ed next goals. The budget had increased-from $17
millionto .$30’million. Capital funds had increased to
$61 million. . .

From then on. while Pitt_'s operating budget grew
space with its programs. its endowment growth remain-
ed almost static. And the Trustees did not assumelany

In fact, the University wasprohibited by the
Board from initiating its own fund-raising efforts to
secure unrestricted endowments until after a $21.5
million campaign for the Health Center was complet-
ed. This emphasis on the Health Center continued up
until almost the end of Litchfield’s’career at Pitt.-

NEW GOALS AND SHOCK TREATMENT

In reviewing his first _years . . . Dr. Litchfield
said that a question frequently put to him was "Did
the trustees know what they were doing?" Litchfields
reply to that. is "Most of them did and the others
soon found out . . . there has been none who has ever
backed away from the consequences of the decision
in the intervening years.‘,’

Litchfield thought that so much has been achiev-
ed toward realizing initial goals that it was highly
possible that the entire "Package" originally mandated
by Scaife and Falk would be delivered in the 603. "if
the boldness of our design can be maintained.“

V Significantly. Acting Board Chairman Leon Falk
agreed. Speaking for the Board. he told the interna-
tional delegates to the Convocation. “Our hopes for
future accomplishments are only ‘enhanced by the ac-
complishments of the past five years." And he adjur—
ed Litchfield “to lead us on to greater_ moments of
high victory." - ' '

PITT FINANCIAL PICTURE TIGHTENS

With the snowballing growth in its programs. Pitt
found itself in a tight cash situation. This. of course.
was nothing new.-When Litchfield arrived in 1956.
he found a cash shortage at least as severe as any
he was to encounter in the '60’s and handled it with
no public fanfare. ‘

The Trustees were seemingly unconcerned. From
1959 on they had approved borrowing against future
State appropriations.

»In 1960. the Board adopted a ten-year financial
plan which foresaw deficits and also anticipated ma-
jor increases in gifts and unrestricted endowment in-
comes. One major decision made by the Board was the
authorization of a $10 million loan from an insurance
company to provide-needed working capital. This loan
was to beincreased by $5 million in 1963.

In 1962 the regional economy was depressed——

one out of eight workers walked the streets, out of a
job. on relief or drawing unemployment benefits.

Plans for increasing tuition were postponed. Because,

of the recession. the entire ten-year financing plan
was in danger of being thrown out of kilter.

THE OAKLAND CORPORATION

Then a new and hopeful element was intro-
duced— Oakland Corporation—a plan to attract a clus-
ter of scientifically—sophisticated research organiza-
tions which would stimulate spin—off technology. there-
by creating newiindustry and new jobs in the Pitts-
burgh area.

Pitt took the lead in forming OakCorp in conjunc-
tion with Tech. Mellon _Institite and other of the
City‘s educational groups. OakCorp was designed as
an instrument to encourage. facilitate. and hasten the
attraction of new private. industrial and government
research to Pittsburgh.

As the first major undertaking. the ambitious
plans—conceived by Max Abramovitz—envisaged span-
ning Panther Hollow. a railway bed ravine between
Pitt and Tech and the Bureau of Mines. It would
utilize "un—usuable“ air space. Plans called for sus-
pending in the gulch a modern three-to-four story. one
mile long structure. the roof of which would form a
landscaped mall leading to an impressive multi-
storied above ground building housing a community
theater. art gallery. and restaurant.

In retrospect. Litchfield admits that -plans for

. Panther Hollow were prematurely released and that

he hired the wrong man. for the temper of the town.
to head OakCorp. '

The man be selected had been highly successful
on a similar project in Boston. There, without Litch-
field's- knowledge. he had incurred the enmity of Ro-
bert Ryan, head of Pittsburghs Mellon-dominated Re-
gional lndustrial Development Corporation.

This was to result in a monumental feud which
played a significant part in OakCorp.s lack of success
in getting support from local financial sources.

The idea of Panther Hollow, with its theater and

restaurants and its relationship with the Oakland cul-‘

tural complex, also collided with plans for the devel-
opment of the Lower Hill district adjacent to the
Golden Triangle.

and art museum bringing the Pittsburgh Symphony

‘Trustee Le‘on2Fal,k was ‘developing a hand- '

same area . . . _

The controversy over whether to bring culture
downtown or refurbish it in Oakland still rages in
Pittsburgh. OakCorp got caught in the middle.

BOARD CONTINUES TO APPROVE
DEFICIT BUDGETS

During the fall meeting of the Board of Trustees
in 1962. there were still high hopes for OakCorp. At
the meeting. Litchfield stressed the need for review
and revision of Pitt‘s operating schedule. of its finan-
cial condition. and most importantly. of the need to
gain new operating funds.

The Board was not unduly alarmed nor were they
concerned about deficit budgeting and the need for
major gifts. They approved a $48 million budget for
1963-64 which projected a deficit of $1.424.000 and an-
ticipated gifts and grants of $5.8 million. -

Because the gifts and grants only reached $1.8
million. the actual deficit materialized as $4.5 million.
the’ sum.of the projected operating deficit plus the
unanticipated gift deficit. —

Previously the-Board had approved deficit budgets
of $1.9 million in 1959-60 and had not balked at a
$3.4 million shortage in 1962-63,

These deficits were later to be the focal point of
a public castigation of Litchfield and the forecasts
were to be termed “pipedreams”—by Trustee Frank
Denton, vice chairmanof Mellon National Bank. . .

Denton. of course, hadapproved the budgets and
the Mellon Bank was the financial advisor for Pitt.
as was Pittsburgh" National Bank whose president is
also on Pitt’s Board.

Editor's Note: The Mellon Bank was not the financial
advisor for Pitt. The Trust department of Mellon Bank man-
aged the University's endowment funds but that repre-
sented a portion of the University's financial operations.

While the Trustees continued to be inactive and
ineffectual in raising funds. Litchfield continued his
successful practice of wooing more receptive donors...

During Litchfield’s tenure. the Government gave
Pitt $62.8 million for research. This was not an unmix-
ed fiscal blessing for often the moniesrequired match-
ing university funds and necessitated rent—free univer-

sity facilities.

Large foundations helped nurture programs to
the extent of $62 million in ten years. Most recently
the Ford Foundation added to previous multi-million
benefices with a grant of $1.5 million for an interna-
tional program on campus.

Subsequently. the fund-raising committee went
fromlimbo to utter oblivion. Chaired by Falk. an ori-
ginal architect of Pitt‘s progress. the committee had
met only on Health Center matters. Falk resigned in
1963 an_d despite Litchfield's urgent requests for a
strong... Trustees committee Price refused to name a

. chairman ora fund—raising group. . . ,

During May 1963. there were ma-ny discussions be-
tween the administration and Trustees Price. Falk and
Denton about the needs for massive new endowment
and ways in which to find it. Litchfield thought that
the Ford Foundation was reluctant to give major funds
because of its awareness of the Mellon money.

Litchfield asked what would happen if Pitt ‘an-
nounced a capital funds campaign for $200 million.
Falk said it was better to wait a year until the NASA
building and other new programs were nai-led down.
Later during-a discussion of a plan long held in abey-
ance because of the Health-Center campaign—an in-

dustrial and corporation annual giving fund which ‘

might raise $1 mil-lion a year—Trustce Falk again
said. "Wait a year."_‘
DON’T TOUCH THE MELLONS _

Denton continously ' threw cold water on any
plans to go to the Mellons—"My job is to make their
money. not to spend it." Othetﬁtrustees concurred with
him. At an Administrative Committee meeting. a Vice

‘ Chancellor raised the question:

“Should the initial commitment for financial back-

ing be called to the attention of those who made it?”

i\;'Ir. Falk thought that to press the question would
arouse a defensive reaction and that good progress
was being made as is. "We should keep the Mellon
families‘ attention fixed on -specific gains for the
presen't."Falk said. » . '

Neither Denton nor Falk thought that Sarah Mel-

_ However. inlate May 1963. Litchfield told Falk
and Price that .."As for the Mellon Foundations we;
have great expectations. We have made a submission

. . which it is hoped may eventually inspire large
giving from that source." . ’ -

For many years, with the professionals on the
Mellon Foundations’ staff, Litchfield had explored
the possibilities of approaching R. K. Mellon directly.
Sounding out conversations with senior advisers close
to members of the Mellon familyjhad indicated, that
if R. K. would take the lead, his cousins, Paul and:
Ailsa, and his sister Sarah would follow suit. As Law-
rence had said, “Richard King Mellon is the bell-
cow.” n

In early spring 1963. Litchfield was encouraged
‘by a Mellon professional to make the presentation as
R.K. Mellon was in the process of drawing up a new
will. This was done. No word has ever been received

Editor's Note: Mellon staff members approachedfg
other Pittsburgh institutions as well. The University was 
not singled out for attention, as a new will‘was drawn ups;

RETRE NCHING BEGINS’

Soon it became apparent that no major gifts would
appear. The 1962-63 budget would run $3.4 million
short. mainly due to cash commitments for real es-
tateand project starts_on GSA buildings. _ _

By the summer of 1964, Denton went to Litch- f_,
field and said. “In order to'get out of this, we have.j7'
to be partners in crime.” Litchfield interpreted this i
to mean that the Board would, for the first time, be-
come involved and responsible in the management of. .
financial affairs including a search for new funds. I  "

faculty, and a sizeable number of secretarial and 
clerical help was laid off. ‘A

There were petty resentments directed toward 
Litchfield's"style of life: his airplane (which he own-
ed but flew on Pitt business); his trips to the Virgin
Islands (which were related to the work Pitt was-’ be-.
ginning inoceanographyi; his corporate activities: his_ —
refusal to play golf or to attend church other than the _. I
University Chapel: his farm—Tumble Run—in Couder-
sport ' . » .,

Many ofthese p/etty grumblings were also made:
directly to Litchfield by the Chairman of the Board;
of Trustees Gwilym Price who placed a high value on-
golfand church. ’ 3

.He felt specifically that public church stewai'd-TF1,

ship was sine qua non and discounted the fact that
Litchfield frequently read the lesson during Protest-2
ant service in the University's Heinz Chapel; and had,
made the Chapel non-denominational. with daily Catli-

olic services and weekly Protestant and Jewish ser- _.
vices.

A salary freeze. announced in December 1964.5 .-
nailed down the public feeling that Pitt wasin trouble.

In the absence of Board support for fund—raising. 
Pitt hustled around with its own programs. Smaller _
corporations were approached. TV" parties were held
as were neighborhood meetings. There were urgent
pleas for alumni funds. In all. $440,000 was raised.

As late as spring 1965. .\/lellon advisers continued"
to offer hope to Litchfieldthat the family would come
through. Mellon’s own staff made a stronger presenta- ,
tion than the university had anticipated. asking for‘
$200 million. They pointed out that the per-student‘ '
medical endowment was larger than Yales: it was high
time to bring the rest of Pitt up to the medical stan-
dards if Pittsburgh was to have the quality institution» 
itneeded.

There’was no response from Mellon. one way or.7

WHAT TO DO ABOUT PITT?

Developments of the first eight months of 1965., V_
suggest that while all this desperate cheese-paring 
was going on—at the expense of peoples jobs and an’-"J
anxious faculty—another decision was being made on-
the 39th floor perhaps triggered by the. request for
a $200 million endowment for Pitt.

While R. K. Mellon probably made the decision3
to turn down the requestgfor major endowment, ‘
it was Frank Denton—Mellon major domo and long
time protector—who decided what else had to be done.-
‘to shield "his patron from growing public attention,

f_,_at.c'ou_ldn’t be solved. except on a stop-gap basis. by
anythiing less than a major endowment (which was
not-to-be'forthcoming) or by massive state-aid.

Secondly. Denton decided that if Pitt‘s publicly
anifounced and widely-heralded move to greatness was
to‘be reversed,. a scapegoat was necessary to protect
the Mellons from charges of reneging on a promise.
 ‘Litchfield was the natural fall-guy. His forceful-
néss; his brilliance and candor had alienated influen-
"i_l*alumni and members of the establishment. Con-
s“e_rv'atives were soured by his forthright» Support of
villiberties and social welfare. '

'._~_..Finally, Denton concluded that if. along with
yvitchfield, Pitt was going to be dumped, somebody
had to pick up the marbles. The obvious candidate
was. the State. The time was ripe because of new in-
trest in the development of higher education—and
because of the anticipated enormous college bulge and
theneed for community colleges.

7 Editor's Note: According to Edison Montgomery, Litch-
field. had seriously considered the possibility of Pitt’s be-
"iming state-related in l964.—He presented the question
‘q._. the Board and the Board decided to try to continue as
rivate institution lg at least one year.

DENTON MOVES

-, With these decisions made, Denton moved skill-
Il’y, being highly selective in the information given
t"to_the public. (By this time it was apparent that
Denton, speaking for the Mellons, dominated the
oard, effectively silencing dissident views.)

, to Unprecedently (sic), the Pitt public relations de-
‘artment sent out a release saying that Pitt trustees
,ad..voted to borrow $4 million from the banks, using_
as.“ security anticipated State support. (This had been
done quietly by the Board since 1959 and was a com-
‘onl though unadvertised practice. both at Pitt and

other schools.) - ‘

- Not made public was the fact that the economics
p,u.t«..,into effect had reduced the anticipated deficit
”or'C'_the current year by one half—from $4.5 million to
23 million.

,, Also not released was the fact that Denton explain-
. in a May .11 Board meeting that the problem was ,
_ it one of solvency but of cash; and that future needs
would average about $2.5 million a year beyond usual
ncome. 4

."In response, Trustee'George Love, a personally
arge donor and chairman of the boards of Chrysler
Corporation and Consolidation Coal, remarked that .
anot_liei:_,$_6_0_,_,rri_i_l_lion in endowment would provide the
i’.5‘”million necessary supplement. He added that “we’

other,” and expressed the feeling that ‘-‘this group

The Trustees. as Love noted, were not only equip-
pjed to handle the problem, but they had been aware
ofuit for a long time. All schools have similar prob-

ad demonstrated a recognition of their responsibility
to faise funds for their institutions.

Trustee Henry O’Neill, a prominent attorney, con-
.ciirred and made a moving-statement.in support of
tchfield and his administration.

t (He pointed out that a corporate annual-giving pro-
gram. which had been structured by the administra-
?tion but never permitted by the trustees; could have
-ledto majortcommitments. Case receives a half-mil-
 on“a year from this source; Cal Tech. $400,000; and
'M.I.T.. one million.

 ' So on May 11, certain responsible Trustees felt
'-that Pitt’s financial difficulties were something they
could handle among themselves.

‘ LITCHFIELD SUF FE RS HEART ATTACK

4 Eleven days later, during a staff meeting. Litch- ‘
field suffered a heart attack and was ordered by his
doctors to cease activities for several months.

~ On June 2, ten days after Litchfield’s coronary.
7the Board met again. Price. at Denton‘s urging. told
-the Board what it would do. He, and a committee of
Trustees, would present to Governor Scranton a reso-
Jlution asking the State for emergency funds.

Price said, “There are no known sources. of pri-
vate funds to provide the $5 million needed beyond
the operating budget to meet necessary expenses for
the next 14 months.” The Board adopted the resolu-
;tion. _ ' '

. , ,Five days later, on June 7. the Trustees met with
Scranton. "Litchfield Played by Trustees" was one
headline; "Pitt’s Woes Taken to State" was another.

‘Banker Denton emerged as the star perf'ormei‘ and
s act warmed up in hearing after hearing. With
_ yer increasing virtuosity. he parlayed Pitt's projected
annual need, for $2.5 million in cash into a $19.5 defi-
-‘cit, somehow run up by Litchfield personally.

claiming any responsibility as a Trustee. “University
finances are a mystery to me. I was on the Board for
six years and never could understand what was hap-

—-- pening.”

He termed Litchfield’s forecasts. "a pipedream.”
Denton claimed the Board had been mesmerized

by Litchfield—that he (Litchfield) had adopted the‘

position that those budget estimates were his own

and that there was no need for another to look at’

them. He ignored the fact that the Board’s own-by-
laws invest the Board with the responsibility for un-
derstanding and approving all programs and finan-
cial dealings.

Both Denton‘ and Board Chairman Price conveni-
ently forgot the hours they themselves had spent on

budgets and the Mellon Banks active role as financial,

counsel to Pitt. U

Editor's Note: As has already been stated, Mellon
Bank was not financial counsel to Pitt, except on matters
relating to endowments.

In late June. two sympathetic Trustees pleaded
with the ailing Litchfield for a resume of Pitt's con-
dition. Litchfield initiated arrangements for an un-
biased report by an outside expert. The Denton-Price
team cancelled the study before it could get underway
and Litchfield, under doctor’s orders. went south.

There he concluded he could do nothing further for
the University and hevdrafted his resignation. .

THE DEFENDERS Ur LITCIIFIELD

Other than a few published «letters to the editor." I
‘mainly from faculty and students, the principal pub--

lic defense of Litchfield came from the students who.
during_ the traditionally low population ‘period ‘of. the
third term‘, got 700 names on a petition and held a
mass rally.

Litchfield, of course. did have supporters on the
Board and in other high places but, with few excep-
tions, they remained silent. To anyone who has lived
in the Mellon Patch this is perfectly understandable.

The Mellons’ power is so pervasive that few Pitts-
burghersenjoy immunity. "

One independent, however, is Judge Anne X.
Alpern, former Attorney General of Pennsylvania,

She reports:

. “Most of the Trustees I talked with thought a crime ‘

was being committed. But none of them would speak
up.” ‘ '

In a private letter to Litchfield, one Trustee “con-
curred with Judge Alpern’s indictment. You could not
have, as she said, possibly’ committedadultery all by
yourself.”

Notably absent as a critic of what had happened
was the one man who could, with relative impunity,
challenge the Mellons—David Leo Lawrence, termed
by Fortune" “boss of the Mellon Patch.”

Privately, Lawrence characteri.zed Litchfield as
"the Scaife-goatof the whole miserable mess, . 

BANKS LEND FOR PA'YRQ_LL

On June 25, a House subcommittee was told by
Pitt officials that Pitt had run up a $19.5 million defi-
cit since 1960 and thatit will need an extra $25 mil-
lion a year from the State from now on.

t On June’ 29, Pitt’ borrowed $1,250,000 from two
‘banks to meet its June payroll, using the anticipated
* State emergency-grant as collateral. On July 2, the
legislature voted Pitt $2.5 million for June and July,
' to be subtracted later from Pitt’s 65-66 appropriations.

' Shortly after the State voted to meet Pitt’s emer-

' gency request for money to pay its faculty and jani-

tors, the Mellons gave $5 million to Carnegie Tech and

$3 million to Duquesne. Upon her death.,in December
.1965, Sarah Mellon Scaife left Pitt $5 million.

On July 20, Litchfield resigned as Chancellor.
almost ten years from the date he arrived to parti-
cipate in “The most exciting educational experience
since the partnership of Rockefeller and the Univer-
sity of Chicago.” '

Subsequently there was never any question but
that Pitt would become State-related;

WHAT HAPPENED?

The Mellon family has given Pitt, mostly in the
last 20 years, a total of approximately $70 million-
much of it before Litchfield, arrived. Of this amount,
$53 million was in the Health Area; $12.5 million was
for Mellon professorships‘ (from- Paul Mellon, not
R-K-); $1 million was for the Van de Graaf accelerator
building; $300,000 was for a chair in British history-
all restricted gifts. The balance of $3 million is
accounted for by a variety-eof small:er, earmarked gifts.

. Wealthy Pittsburgh families—Heinz. Falk. Frickf
Hillman, and others—have given generously. almost
$13 million: but those funds. too, have been restricted

(for instance. the F‘rickVArt Building and the Hillman
Library).

it has not been well balanced in terms of the needs
of the total university. The crying need today is for
income to sustain the body of the university as well
as its several arms.”

Litchfield had constantly pointed out to the Trus-
tees this explicit point. yet when he resigned. out of
the $61.3 million endowment only $12,500,000 was un-
restricted. -

The point is not that the Mellons and others have
not supported Pitt. They have.

But they have done so unwisely, capriciously,und
—in terms of their moral commitmentto build a great
university—parsimoniously.

. (Ivy League trustees would be amazed to know
that 15 Pitt trustees, heads of vested wealth, with
yearly incomes ranging from $250.000 to $10 million,
personally gave less than $1,000 on‘ the average dur-
ing the 1964-65—."crisis.“’ Six of the group gave noth-

.ing. It was a 10-year habit for many. )

\’vriA'I‘ ABOUT THE COMMUNITY LEADERS?

In retrospect, it seems likely that Richard King
Mellon never was interested in Pitt's becoming a great
school. His major interests were in the Health area.
And because of family rivalry, it is possible that he
was unsympathetic to the idea of picking up what his
brother-in-law Alan Scaife had left. It is known that
on the 39th.floor there was a tendency to say. “Sar-
ah’s boys started it, let them finish it.”

Other members of Pittsburgh‘s power structure,
many of them_Pitt trustees, followed Mellon’s lead.
Also, some of them felt threatened, as perhaps did
Mellon, when Litchfield’s "leadership in the commun-
ity skyrocketed during the favorable initiation of the
OakCorp.. The power elite had a comfortable pecking
order. Litchfield loomed as an unpredictable", inde-
pendent “Third Force." The Squirearchy has always
beenuncomfortable when confronted with ideas;

Perhaps the clue lies in Sargent; Shriver’s quip
at Pitt’s 1965 commencement when he characterized
Pittsburgh as the town “Davey Lawrence built, Dick
Mellon bought, Ed Litchfield owns—and the only
question is, is Bill Scranton big enough to carry it. . .”

The Board of Trustees were delinquent and negli--

‘gent in their trust. On the one hand failing ‘to raise
-funds. On the other, failing to sit on Litchfield’s

flying coat-tails if that is what they thought was need-
ed.

When it became obvious that the Trusteeswould
have to take- -‘a responsible part in Pitt affairs, they

panicked behind Denton, ran to the State and abused *

Litchfield so that he became the scapegoat for their
defalcations. They had achieved two goals: they got
rid of an upstart University and an upstart Chancellor.
By placing the blame on Litchfield they saved their
own face and that of the Mellons who had initially
led Litchfield up the primrose path.

Perhaps, unlike the physical Renaissance, they
were unable to see the development of a great uni-
versity as their responsibility or as redounding to
their benefit. -

In the most basic sense. the Renaissance was a
"protection of huge corporation assets tied up in enor-
émous mills and plants. Pittsburgh had to be resuscitat-
ed or—as Frank Lloyd Wright once suggested—aban—
doned. While resuscitation required large investments
from the corporate interests, very little demand was
placed on private fortunes.

A university, unlike slum clearance and parking

garages, is at its best an idea nourished by public .

. passion and private philanthropy.

ents leads one to ponder the moral responsibility of

constricting broad visions.

There has been grave damage done.

Damage to the reputation of Litchfield. Damage
to the aspirations of administration, faculty and stu-
dents who came to Pitt because it was growing and
dynamic. Damage to a community, only now emerg-

eager to follow Pitt's lead into the space age.

The image of Pittsburgh as a Renaissance City
has been tarnished, as has the ability of higher edu-

cation to play a ‘major. fruitful role in community"

development.

Most important is the overall harm done to a
community which had initially been given new hope

that a people willing to set new standards could '

measure up to these standards through conscious and
rational action. ‘

tors. Ironically. Tate and Cole-
man were the only ‘two that fin-
ished ahead of the str‘ea_king soph-

If you think 

that ordination
is something
' like graduation ._
——and the time
in between i
similar to marking time—then
you couldn't be more mistaken.

j The Paulists were founded
with the belief that each man is
a member of the community and
he contributes his own thing.
Each is an individual with his
own talents and he is given the
freedom to use them in his own
way. But not later. Now.

For instance, during the no-
vitiate, novices work in‘ such
~ diverse areas as hospitals, voca-
tional rehabilitation centers and
Universities.They serve as assist-
ant chaplains, co-retreat masters,
student teachers and psychiatric
aides.

Paulist Seminarians create
recreational programs, direct
« “Days of Recollection” for CCD
students, direct film series, ex-
periment with the use of media
in the liturgy as a preaching tool,
originate and edit the Paulist
Free Press, coordinate Lenten
lectures and organize Home
Masses, to mention just a few.

When you commit yourself to
the Paulists, it isn’t a someday
thing. It's .now. Today.

For more information about
the Paulists write to: Rev. Don-
ald C. Campbell, C.S.P., Voca-
tion Director, Room 300.

tle for the last two playoff spots

transportation costs. This will
probably be one of the most ex-
citing home games this season,
because PSU has a stronger
club than all the other teams in
the league.

which are needed for the prelim-
inaries, are $3:00, $3:50, $5250.
and $6250. Fans will be able to
see the Pitt game free of charge
