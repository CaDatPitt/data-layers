Report criticizes Pitt misconduct investigations

By Jenifer Crook
Senior Staff Writer

A congressional report released last week
sharply criticized the University of
Pittsburgh for its handling of two medical-
school, research-misconduct cases’.

Released Sept. 9, the report by the Human
Resources and Intergovernmental Relations
Subcommittee is the result of a three-year
investigation into 10 cases of alleged
misconduct. The cases occurred at
universities which receive Public Health
Service funds.

“The reporting of misleading research
results poses an obvious danger to. the
public,” the report reads. “Federal agencies,
congressional committees, scientific

Greeks will enforce
‘closed party’ policy

By Karen D. Speece
Staff Writer

Increased membership, a new alcohol policy, quality pledges and
“Greek 101” will highlight Greek life this semester at Pitt.

“The trend is that more people are joining fraternities because
fraternities are not what they were in the past. Now they have
something to offer,” said Tony Spinola, Inter—Fraternity Council

president.

Over the summer, a revision was made to the IFC’s social policy.
Spinola said that the policy is basically the same as before, but the I,

enforcement has changed.

“According to the current policy, there are no open parties allowed.
An open party i_s one that ‘everyone’ is invited to. Last year [even
though parties were closed] the fraternities were allowed to have as
big a guest list as they wanted. Some guest lists had over 1,000 people,
so it technically wasn't a closed party,” Spinola said.

Under the new policy, fraternities’ guest lists are limited to four
guests per brother. The board arrived at this number because it
allowed for a maximum number of guests at an event, maintained fire '
codes and alleviated many of the legal problems larger events caused.

Spinola said, “The policy was created so that underage drinking
does not occur, and to reduce other risks at social functions where
alcohol is served. The focus isn’t on alcohol anymore.

“[Pitt’s] fraternities and sororities have adapted la drinking policy] a
lot like Penn State’s have. [Penn State’s system] is very uniﬁed.
Fraternities are having social functions and mixers with each other,
and I think that’s going to be an important trend.”

Fraternities drew in 278 new brothers this fall, bringing the total
number of social—fraternity members on campus to 1,024. Sororities

pledged 220 of the 420 girls who rushed.

“From talking to the houses, they were interested in the quality [of
their pledges]. They didn't take the maximum [number of pledges]

Santorum wants humanitarian Repub

By Jenna Ferrara

the 18th Congressional District,

journals and the research and academic
communities have begun to question
whether more needs to be done to prevent
and respond to allegations of scientific
misconduct.”

The report states that thorough
investigations into misconduct are seldom
performed; therefore, universities “rarely
find their faculty guilty of wrongdoing.” In
addition, it charges that universities often
“retaliate against the whistle-blowers" who
make the allegationsof misconduct.

One of the Pitt cases cited concerns Dr.
Charles Bluestone, principal investigator
of research evaluating the effectiveness of
amoxycillan, an antibiotic used in the
treatment of otitis media an inﬂammatory
infection of the middle ear. The study was

conducted through Children's Hospital.

The results of the study by Bluestone
and his- team show that amoxycillan
effectively fights middle-ear infections.
However, Bluestone’s assistant, Dr. Erdem
Cantekin, interpreted the data differently,
claiming that amoxycillan actually causes
recurrences of middle-ear infections in
children.

In 1987, Cantekin accused Bluestone of
using flawed research methods. He also
asserted that since Bluestone had accepted
research funding and payments for
speeches from pharmaceutical companies
that manufactured amoxycillan, he might
have had a conflict of interest. In addition,
Cantekin alleged that Bluestone did not
disclose the individual dollar amounts he

received from each private company, as
required in the NIH research application
form.

According to Lewis Popper, general
counsel for Pitt, the form was not clear in
requesting the exact dollar amount of
private funding. As a result of this case, he
said NIH has revised its research application
form in order to avoid confusion.

Popper said that the university responded
to the accusations by forming three panels
to investigate Bluestone’s work, all of which
cleared Bluestone of the charges. In
addition, Popper added, a National Institute
of Health committee also exonerated
Bluestone of scientific misconduct.

But the congressional report stated that

memorial

By Donna L. Terrell
For The Pitt,News

A memorial fund designed to

help local youths who need help

handling personal problems is

being established on behalf of
Paul A. Fisherjr., who committed
suicide after a ﬁve—hour standoff
with police on Sept. 7.

Donations are being accepted
at Thirsty’s Restaurant and Saloon
for The Whale’s Tale Crisis
Intervention and Counseling
Service on Fisher’s behalf.

The Whale’s Tale, which
services troubled Pittsburgh
youths and their families, was
chosen as the fund benefactor
because, according to The
Whale’s Tale Executive Secretary
Peggy Kuhn, Fisher’s friends “just
wanted to give money to a place
that helps people.”

Denny Byrd, owner and
operator of Thirsty’s, where Fisher
had been a regular customer for
the last four years, said he
considered Fisher to be a part of
his extended family. Fisher was

Supporting a “humanitarian
Republican Party" and an end to
government bureaucracy,
candidate for Congress Rick
Santorum spoke before an
audience of approximately 30
yesterday.

The College Republicans
sponsored Santorum’s speech in
the William Pitt Union yesterday.
Santorum, 32, is challenging
incumbent Rep. Doug Walgren in

which encompasses much of
Allegheny County.

“I think that a lot of people feel
[helpless] about the [government].
And that is going to be a [benefit]
for candidates running against
incumbents. It’s time to make
some changes,” he said.

Only one Republican defeated
a Democratic incumbent in the
1988 Congressional election, said
Santorum. “[In this election] you
have the opportunity to send a
message to Washington, [D.C.] To

the new era of government.”

According to Santorum,
Congress is currently meeting at
Andrews Air Force Base. “If we've
[reached] the point where we have
to isolate our Congress [so that it
can] make decisions that’s
telling us that we have a Congress
that’s not responsible enough to
deal with the issues,” Santorum
said.

“In the past, people have come
to the Republican Party with their
problems, and we haven't cared,”

abdicated the responsibility of
solving problems. All we do is say
no to [Democratic] solutions. We
need to be creative enough to
[formulate] our own solutions. As
Republicans, we need to be more
than cheap Democrats."
Santorum approves of President
George Bush’s policy concerning
the conflict in the Middle East.
“George Bush is by far the most
qualified person we've ever had
in the presidency, especially

Byrd hopes the fund will draw
attention to Fisher’s plight and
change the public’s perception of
Fisher. Byrd expressed his outrage
over Fisher being labeled as a
“sniper” and a “gunman.”

He said Fisher was a “heavy

would come to the saloon to play
with his lap—top computer, read
books and play darts with the
other customers. Fisher would talk

Student stopped from advertising bemp group

By Renee Crespy
For The Pitt News

Make marijuana legal? That's
what members of Help End
Marijuana Prohibition want.

Pitt student Dan Meekins, a
member of HEMP, is trying to start
an official HEMP chapter at Pitt.
Meekins said he simply wants
people to consider the subject. He
said that the group is not oriented
toward making hemp legal for
smoking purposes, although he
does like to smoke occasionally
and has been arrested for it twice.

Meekins, who participated in
the HEMP march last Saturday,
said that he has had a difficult time
informing people about HEMP, or
the march, because of the
management of the William Pitt
Union. Meekins said that a WPU
employee refused to let him post
any of his signs around campus,
but a member of HEMP posted
several signs on university trash
cans without knowing that it was
against WPU rules. Meekins said

that the WPU management is
going to bill him for this but has
not done so thus far.

According to Meekins, another
member of HEMP unknowingly
posted HEMP signs on university
trash cans. Meekins said that
Union management is going to
bill the organization for that, but
has not done so thus far.

Kim Macey, a WPU employee,
confirmed that the building
refused to allow Meekins to post
his signs because of a policy which
states that any signs dealing with
the promotion of alcohol or drug
use are prohibited. Macey also
confirmed that the union will bill
Meekins.

In order to start a HEMP chapter
at Pitt, Meekins must have 10
signatures of students who are
interested in joining and one
faculty member’s signature, or 100
students’ names, including one
faculty member, who would just
like to see the group on campus.

Hemp could be the source for a
better world, according to

information from the Business
Alliance for Commerce in Hemp.

Hemp is a soil-building plant
that is excellent for crop rotation
and is naturally resistant to bugs
and weeds, making pesticides
and heavy fertilizers unnecessary,
according to BACH.

One acre of hemp can produce
as much paper as 4.1 acres of
forest over a 20-year period. Paper
made from hemp lasts longer and
uses less of the dangerous
chemicals needed to make paper
from wood, according to BACH.

Up until 1883, 90 percent of all
paper was made from hemp,
including the first draft of the
Declaration of Independence,
Thomas Paine’s pamphlets, Lewis
Carroll’s Alice in Wonderland and
virtually every other book, map,
money and newspaper printed.
Hemp has a plethora of other
uses besides paper and soil
builders, BACH representatives
said. For example:

completely biodegradable and

can be used to make plastic.

-Fabrics can be made from
hemp, which are warmer, softer,
stronger and last 26 times longer
than cotton.

-Hemp is the largest cash crop
in several states, including
California ($3 billion per year).
Because of this, hemp could
ﬁnancially save the American
farmer.

-Fuel and oil can be made from
hemp plants. The methanol from
hemp plants, which can make oil
when burned, produces carbon
dioxide; however, photosynthesis
during the growth cycle of the
plant removes four times as much
carbon dioxide from the air as it
puts out, actually cleaning the
atmosphere.

-The oil from hemp seeds can
be used to run any diesel engine.
In fact, hemp could replace 50
percent of the oil consumed
domestically without any off-
shore drilling or risk of oil spills.

Former bulimia—reXic encourages students to seek help

By Linda Holley
For T be Pitt News

Four years ago, Rhonda
T ominello was a bulima-rexic.
She suffered from both bulimia
and anorexia nervosa, eating
disorders prevalent among
col1ege—age women.

As a sophomore at the
University of Pittsburgh,
Tominello found herself eating
average-sized meals in the
cafeteria but later sneaking away
to purge the food.

At first she would binge and
then purge once every two
weeks. Then, over a two-year
period, she lost control.
Tominello would binge and
purge up to six times a day.

“It became addictive —-—like
drinking alcohol,” she said. “At
first you felt in control by the
sensation you got from purging,
but then you felt this
overwhelming sense of guilt. It
became a cycle, binge—purge-
guilt, binge-purge-guilt.”

Tominello began to show
outward signs of ‘her eating
disorders. She had mood swings;
her health was deteriorating; she
tried to isolate herself; she was
depressed, and she thought in an
obsessive-compulsive manner.

Byrd said he was aware of

of his mother's death last year,
adding that there was “absolutely
no indication” of his plans when
he talked to Byrd for an hour the
day before his suicide vigil.

the police handled the situation.
He and Fisher’s other friends were
not allowed to talk to Fisher.

“If we had had the chance to

Byrd realizes that insuring
public safety is the police
department’s top priority, stating
that they “did an excellent job,”
but he thinks giving friends access

“First, fraternities are improving

“Secondly, a few of the chapters

After two months in the hospital

Now Rhonda Tominello is
trying to encourage other people
with eating disorders to seek
professional help. “I feel pretty
strong about myself. I can't be
ashamed of [having bulima—rexia].
I was just trying to survive like the

worker Tawnya Ferris, are models

Tominello is also on the

“Find someone you trust and

W/l9ale’s T ale provides safe /am/enfor those with nowhere to go,

By Jennifer Swoboda
For The Pitt News

There are approximately 4,000
runaway and homeless youths on
the streets of Allegheny County
each year.

A center that provides a number
of services for these youth is The
Whale’s Tale Downtown
Outreach Center and Shelter. It
offers a safe place to stay, two
meals a day, clothing and free
medical screening and treatment,
according to Nancy Lee Cochran,
director of development and
public relations for the center.

The Whale’s Tale uses the
slogan “A Safe Place” to
emphasize the security it provides
for those who go there feeling
they have no one to turn to and no
where to go.

The Whale’s Tale derives its
unique name from the biblical
story of Jonah and the whale. In
this story Jonah is sheltered in a
whale, and while he is there, he’s
able to resolve his conflicts and
gain a sense of comfort.

Cochran said, “Like Jonah, our

Nations’ involvement in the Iraqi

clients need a safe place to take
time to examine their lives, sort
out conflicts, regain direction and
set goals.”

Cochran also said that “most
people view these kids as
troublemakers rather than
troubled,” yet 60 percent "of all
runaways have had no contact
with the police prior to running
away.

Along with providing the basic
needs for the youth who come to
them, such as food and shelter,
the staff at the center also provides
counseling for all those who need
or want it, said Jerome McCoy, a
residential counselor at the center.

McCoy said, “Most of these kids
just need someone they can trust
and to know [that] someone
cares”.

The Downtown Outreach
Center, though providing mainly
for persons under the age of 21,
also provide services for homeless
adults. It offers free medical
screening and treatment, health
counseling, pregnancy testing,
referral for eyeglasses and
educational sessions on such

topics as drug and alcohol abuse
and sexually transmitted diseases.

Also located in the center is the
Bridge Housing Program, which
enables applicants between the
ages of 17 and 21 to live in a more
independent environment. The
program acts as an actual bridge,
enabling individuals to stay there
until finding their own permanent
residence.

During the stay in the Bridge
Housing Program, which lasts
from six to nine months, skills
such as budgeting, shopping,
preparing healthy meals and even
getting to work on time are taught
by staff members. The staff also
helps the residents identify
educational and job opportunities.

According to Cochran, the youth
who come to the downtown
shelter or Bridge Housing Program
are not necessarily runaways or
homeless. They may just need a
place to stay or counseling for
issues such as parent-child
conflicts, marital discord, physical
or sexual abuse of children or
poor family communication.
There are also services provided

for families with special needs for
in-home services, and there is a
24-hour crisis-response hotline for
emergency counseling.

Opened in 1988, the Downtown
Center and Shelter is one of many
of The Whale’s Tale centers.

Whale’s Tale also provides a
youth- and family—counseling
center and chemical—abuse
treatment and prevention services
in three centers located in the
North Hills, Penn Hills and
Shadyside. There are Youth
Emergency Shelter services in
Shadyside, Lawrenceville, Shaler,
South Fayette, Plum and in
downtown Pittsburgh.

The centers include an
Adolescent Skill Advancement
Program, which educates teens
between the ages of 16 and 18 on

Whale’s Tale Learning Center.
These programs ares located in
Wilkinsburg and Shadyside.
There are also more than 70
locations, such as 36 Giant Eagle
stores, 24 Domino’s Pizza
locations and several boys’ and
girls’ clubs in the county that post ‘
Safe Place signs that read “The
Whale’s Tale: A Safe Place.” These
specific locations are known as
safe-place sites, and any youth
may stop there in a time of crisis.
An employee at that particular
location will call The Wha1e’s Tale,
and a trained volunteer will arrive

at the site within 15 minutes to‘/‘

He also concurs with Bush's

Santorum, along with his
audience, was especially critical

of raising taxes. “Every tax

reason that I'm running for the
U.S. Congress. We need people
who are going to vote for the
reductions in spending that are
going to solve the problem of the
budget deficit," said Santorum.
“No way would I [vote for raising]
the income tax.”

Santorum supports Sen. Dale
Bumpers’ [D-Ark.) proposal
concerning the capital—gains tax.
Bumpers advocates “not a tax
break for the rich,  but a limited
tax break for the small-business
men  that make things "happen
in the economy,” said Santorum.

Santorum favors the National
Endowment for the Arts yet
approves of some restrictions
upon NEA funding. “I support
Sen. Orrin Hatch’s [R-Utahl
proposal to let the courts [rather
than Congress] decide what [art]
is obscene [and refuse to fund
such artl.”

The government welfare
bureaucracy has destroyed the
black family, “which used to be
the strongest_family unit in the
United States,” said Santorum.
‘‘Twenty-five years ago, 16 percent
of all black children were born
out of wedlock. Today [that figure
is] 61 percent. ” Republicans need
to offer viable solutions to the
problems of the poor and the
underclass, said Santorum.

“People come to me and said ‘I
won’t vote for you. You’re a
Republican and you don’t care
about me.’ I don't blame them
because in the past we haven’t
cared.” The Republican Party
needs to become more attentive
to its constituency, said Santorum.

Kevin Docherty, College
Republican treasurer, was pleased
with Santorum’s speech. “He’s a
dynamic speaker  he’s young,
and I think it’s important to have
someone near our [college] age
bracket in office."

College Republican President
Todd Jordan sees Santorum as a
viable candidate and said that the
College Republicans will be
actively involved in his campaign.

Pitt Air Force ROTC celebrates national Appreciation Day

. Byjenna Ferrara

Lack of public awareness of Air Force
The Pitt News

programs is a problem, Adams said.
“Whenever [people] think of ROTC, they
always think of the Army.”

“Visibility is key this year,” said Adams.
“We need to get more visual this term  No
one knows we’re here.” According to
Adams, Pitt students rarely notice Air Force
cadets because “[they usually] only wear
[their] uniforms once a week.”

Capt. Bill Petrozzi agreed with Adams
that the public is largely misinformed about
opportunities in the Air Force. “[The Air
Y€3Y1Y 3fmiV€FS3fY Of the Air FOICC. 00 Force] offers [practically] all jobs that exist

separate branch of the U. 3. Armed Forces. Journalists’ medical and legal personnel,

Airplane-shaped flyers were distributed
by Pitt Air Force Reserve Officers’ Training
Corps cadets yesterday in celebration of
Air Force Appreciation Day.

The pamphlets were circulated in front

Q of the William Pitt Union to publicize the
Pitt Air Force ROTC. According to Cadet 1st
Lt. Kendall Adams, this is the first year that
the Pitt Air Force ROTC has held an event
outside‘ of the military to celebrate the

aircraft maintenance technicians and
engineers are all part of the Air Force, said
Petrozzi.

Pitt students are also uninformed about
the educational benefits offered through
the Air Force, according to Petrozzi. “There
is still scholarship money available [at Pittl,"
he said.

Adams, a scholarship cadet, is planning
on entering hospital administration when
he goes on active duty after graduation.
‘‘You’re “ guaranteed an active—duty
commission when you graduate from Air
Force ROTC,” he said.

Petrozzi hopes that the ﬂyers shaped
like airplanes will help to promote the Air

Force. According to Petrozzi, the cadets
themselves initiated this public—relations
technique. First-year cadet Edna Fisher
credits Cadet Major Matthew Whitely with
the idea.

Although paper airplanes are an apt way
to publicize the Air Force, “with paper
airplanes, people are going to fly them,”
said Petrozzi. When Fisher was passing the
flyers out, she saw a few people “trying to
get them stuck in the trees.” However,
according to Petrozzi, the cadets are
responsible for collecting any stray paper
aircraft strewn across campus.

“lPetrozzil didn’t mention that to us,”
said Adams.

However, Cantekin said that

Institutes of Mental

Health

was a legitimate criticism in that
that

_ Pitt “did not carefully review the

documents that could have
provided more l objective
information, not even those that
Cantekin provided.”

The report asserts that because
Cantekin “blew the whistle” on
Bluestone, the university
punished him by blocking the
publishing of his ﬁndings in the
NewEngland]0umal ofMedz'c1'ne.
Cantekin was also removed from
his position as the director of
research for the department of
otolaryngology (ear, nose and
throat) at Children’s Hospital and
moved to a windowless office
above the Forbes Avenue Giant

L Eagle.

However, Pitt officials contend
that Cantekin was not
reprimanded for disagreeing with
Bluestone but rather for the

dissent.

“Without announcing it, Dr.
Cantekin sent his manuscript to
the New England Journal of
Medicine. The manuscript made
it appear that it was the official
one of the whole research team.
He was crediting himself for all of
the work.

“The university view is that this
manuscript is unethical, dishonest
and uncollegiate. That is the
reason Cantekin is on five years’
probation. The university
encouraged him to publish his
opposing views but in the correct
way.”

Cantekin said that he did credit
Bluestone and his team in the
cover letter of his paper. He said
that the report “speaks for itself.
Of course, it exonerates me of all
of those charges.”

 
   

 

 

 

 

AFTER

other issues remain unanswered.

“It’s been five years since I
announced that amoxycillan is not
effective against middle-ear
infection. Thirty million people
are treated with amoxycillan each
year. What will the University of
Pittsburgh do when the taxpayers,
who have paid more than [$500
million] to purchase this drug,
become angry about it not being
effective?”

Cantekin said that though he
was informed of his probation
two months ago, “I have no idea
what that means.” He added that
he does plan to stay at Pitt, “and
clean up all of this
misinformation.”

The second Pitt case in the
subcommittee report involved
Stephen Breuning, a former
psychiatry professor. A National

investigation concluded
Breuning had fabricated data

while conducting a study on drugs
for mentally disturbed children.

The misconduct occurred before

Breuning came to Pitt,- said
Popper.

“NIMH wrote to us, and we
found serious problems with his
work. We confronted him and
asked him to resign, and he did,”
Popper said.

But the congressional report
said that Pitt did not do enough;
the university should have
investigated the research
Breuning was conducting at. Pitt
prior to his resignation.

“We thought we had imposed
the maximum sanction — he was
gone,” said Popper. “NIMHP then
asked us to look into his research
here, and we did. But I think there

we didn’t move very quickly on
that.”

In both cases, Popper said,‘

Congress erred by “applying
today’s standards to yesterday’s

work. They’re taking laws that A

are not in effect today and telling
us we should have followed them.
These laws may never even go
into effect.”

Came/em, Pitt hoth at fault

The University of Pittsburgh is under fire from the
government for alleged wrongdoings in its medical-
research department. _

Dr. Charles Bluestone, who was in charge of a study to
determine the effects of amoxycillan, said that the drug
was an effective treatment for rniddle—ear infections.

However, Dr. Erdem Cantekin, who worked under
Bluestone, attempted to publish his own findings, saying

i that Bluestone’s findings were mistaken.

The report states that Cantekin was unable to print his
findings in the NewEnglandjoumal ofMedz'cmebecause
Pitt blocked the publishing ‘and that Cantekin was unfairly
punished after the incident. ‘

Cantekin has been replaced as director of otolaryngology
at Pitt. , With no warning, he was moved from his
Children’s Hospital office to a windowless one above the
Giant Eagle on Forbes Avenue.

Bluestone’s ﬂawed research was the direct result of
Pitt’s inability to detect the actions on its campus.

Pitt tried to quiet Cantekin when he found that Bluestone’s
findings were inaccurate. Yet the man who made the

mistakes was not punished; the man who pointed them 

out was.

The National Institutes of Health is about to release a
report that suggests that Pitt place Bluestone on five years’
probation, according to Cantekin. It said that Bluestone
was deceptive in disclosing his private funding. If the NIH
feels that Bluestone should be punished, then the university
has the obligation to do so.

' But Cantekin is not entirely without fault in this situation.
He should have gone through the proper channels before

‘attempting to have his findings published. Though his

intentions were admirable, his methods of carrying them
through were not.

By letting these problems go unchecked, Pitt is merely
contributing to even more wrongdoings in the research
laboratories. Bluestone’s flawed reports could have been
averted had the university been in touch with him during
his study. ‘

The congressional report also states that Pitt “did not
carefully review the documents that could have provided
more objective information  ‘_‘ This is because the
university does not make scheduled research reports
mandatory.

As a station of research, the University of Pittsburgh
should know exactly what is going on in its laboratories.
Pitt needs to reorganize its research funding policy. If Pitt
knows who is giving its researchers money, then conﬂict—
of-interest cases such as these can be dealt with by Pitt,
rather than by Congress, saving Pitt’s respected medical
department unneeded embarrassment.

Lying becoming

Truth is so obscure in these
times and falsehood so
established, that unless we love
the truth, we cannot know it.

——Pascal

I am 6 feet, 2 inches tall, weigh
180‘pounds and currently hold a
5.24 grade—point average here at

I the University of Pittsburgh. I

jog about six miles a day, read
Shakespeare in the afternoon and
play the violin in the evening.
Having dated Kim Basinger and
several minor starlets, I have
decided to try photography and
playing professional baseball in
my spare time. Oh, and by the
way, my skin is purple; my eyes

are a misty blue, and I am related I

to Elsie Hillman.

Can you figure out where the
lies are?

Now, I’m not going to say lying
is bad. Or that lying is more
prevalent in these dark times than
it was in the past. No, I’m going to
talk about lying as an art form.

Yes, that’s right, an art form.
For a practice so widely used in
this country and around the
world, a lot of people are still
pretty bad at it. But lying is not as
easy as it may appear. Telling the
truth may be boring,
unimaginative and easy, but lying
takes creativity, a straight face
and fairly elastic morals. A man
more famous than myself once
said, “If, like the truth, falsehood
had one aspect, we would be on
better terms. For we would accept
as certain the opposite of what
the liar would say. But the reverse

of truth has a hundred thousand -

faces and an infinite field".

The challenge in lying is in the
fact that truth exists and lying
exists to imitate the truth. Telling
the truth cannot be rated.
However, there is a great
difference between a good lie
and a bad lie. 80, to improve
people's basic lying skills, I have
come up with four guidelines to
follow:

1) Good liars should know
their audiences.

The most important guideline:
When lying about a piece of
American history, you shouldn’t
have an American-history

A professor as your audience. The

less your audience knows about
a subject, the easier it is to lie
about it. An even better scenario
is if you know exactly what your
audience knows and what it

‘doesn’t know. The reason why

this is important is explained in
guideline No. 4.

 

Jason
Hillman

2)Alieshouldbebelievable.

Saying thatl am originally from
the planetMars is believable only
to a few “humans.” If I were to say
thatl hail from Des Moines, Iowa,
however 

3) A lie should be hard to
verify.

This seems obvious enough,
but this is the rule people most
often ignore. When a sit-com dad
says that lying doesn't pay, he
most often is inadvertently talking
about this rule. Don’t grossly lie
about your height to someone
you plan on seeing; don’t lie about
your job to someone you are
dating (unless you aren’t planning
on dating them for long), and it’s
usually a bad idea to lie about
your basketball expertise just

before a game.

4) A lie should be mixed
with some easily veriﬁable
truths.

This is not a necessity, but it
can be vital in solidifying a good
lie. To say I'm from Des Moines

an art form

is one thing; to know that the
population is 192,060, that the
unemployment rate is 4.4 percent
and that the city manager
(equivalent of a mayor) is John
Dorrian adds credence to my
words. If you think that no one
wants to make that kind of effort
for a lie, I ask you to think of the
effort many people put into fake
IDs: memorizing birth date,
graduation date, zodiac sign and
so on.

Here are a couple of other
things to remember about lying.
On the average, lies shouldn’t
provoke thought. The less people
think, the less inclined they are
to check the lie. Sometimes being
vague is helpful. People don’t
check what they don’t
understand. It also helps if the
person wants to believe the lie.

So, in retrospect, you can judge
some of yourown lies and the
lies of others and see why they
did or didn’t work. George Bush’s
lie about “no new taxes” (and it is
a lie, no doubt) might seem like
a pretty lame attempt at a lie. But

he followed three of the four
guidelines; He knew his audience;
his lie was one that people wanted
to believe, and the lie was one
that was nearly impossible to
prove false when it was said. He
nullified the fourth guideline by
not having any facts (being
vague). The result was a very
successful lie. It wasn’t creative
or interesting, but it worked.

That’s the problem with lying
today. We as a public aren’t a
tough enough crowd. We should
push our government and
ourselves to new levels of lying.

» Don’t believe politicians the first

time they say something. Force
them ‘to come up with a really
good lie. We have a responsibility
not only to be good liars but to be
a good audience. I mean, it’s hard
to respect a person who believes
a lie that is the political equivalent
of “My grandmother is Elsie
Hillman.” ,

Collegiate head coach or
Entertainer of the Year?

Syracuse football coach Dick

,MacPherson has long been
known for his humor, candor
and off-the-cuff comments when
talking about his life’s work. He
is a media gem, one of those
people you always enjoy
speaking to in this business.

Even when he’s all business,
MacPherson still manages to
interject a few humorous
anecdotes. The man certainly
knows his job and has been quite
successful at it. Now in his 10th
season as the Orangemen’s head
coach, MacPherson has posted a
60-43% record.

Syracuse has pasted a “1” into
each of its win-loss-tie columns
this year, losing to University of
Southern California 54-16 in its
season opener, defeating Temple
in its home opener and tying
Michigan State 23-25 at home last
Saturday in the Carrier Dome.

Regarded as the coach of “one
of the, if not the best team in the
East” by Pitt Coach Paul Hackett,

Paul Diamond/The Pitt News
Dick MacPherson“has become as Well known for his humor as he has for his talent while at Syracuse.

One of the best in the east talks ‘serious football’

MacPherson is eager to take on
the Panthers this Saturday in one
of the East’s major rivalries. And
MacPherson is ready to put his
talent on display after evaluating
his troops through the first three
games.

“We opened up against USC in
the Kickoff Classic, and we chose
it because our kids wanted to
play it, and secondly because we
thought it would help us become
a better football team because
[USC] is such a great team,”
MacPherson said.

“And quite honestly, I think it
has helped us in terms of getting
our program in shape, and I think
it helped our young quarterback
Marvin Graves.”

Graves is a redshirt freshman
with a natural passing ability and
a penchant for running the
Orangemen’s pro-option offense.
He has already racked up 586
yards and four touchdowns in
three games while rushing for 91
yards. ‘

“If we are gong to be any better
this year, it’s because of Marvin,
from an offensive standpoint,”
MacPherson said. “Marvin is

Pitt punter proving to be leta Weapon in game plan

By Doug Miller
Staff Writer

In Pitt football’s 100 years of existence, it had never been done
before. Its next closest was still two yards short; it is definitely
highlight material. “It” is Panther punter Brian Greenﬁeld’s 79-yard
punt against Boston College on Sept. 8.

People normally don't think of a punter as a threat, or even a
weapon —— that is, until now. When a 21-year-old possesses a leg
that launches a ball far into the sky, much like a Howitzer cannon
launches missiles into the ozone, you definitely have a threatening
weapon. _

Greenfield transferred to Pitt last fall from Glendale (Calif)
Community College, and promptly finished 17th in the country
with a solid 417- yard average. W/hat is remarkable is that he used
his deft touch to trap the ball within opponents’ 20-yard lines

numerous times, which hurt his overall average. This year, backup
quarterback Scott Stark handles the short precision punts, while
Greenfield lets his tight-spiraled boomers fly.

“I think in the back of most punters’ minds, there is that goal to
lead the nation in punting distance for that given year. I am asked
to punt in many different situations, so the main concern is doing
what the team asks of you,” Greenfield said.

Even though those situations have arisen for him, Greenfield
now claims the fourth—best average in the nation with 48.4 yards.
That mark is nearly four yards ahead ofPitt’s all-time record, set by
Larry Swider of the 1976 National Championship team.

The three punters currently ahead of Greenfield all kick for
schools located in the Rocky Mountains, where the air is thinner
and the punts go much farther.

So how does one become one of the best punters in the land?
“I’ve played soccer all my life, pretty much up through high school;
so when I decided to kick the football, it was a natural transition.”

Greenfield garnered three letters in soccer and two in football at

THE PIT!‘ NEWS, Wednesday, September 19, 1990

MacPherson

Continued from page 10 '
smooth; he’s got a gun like we’ve
never had before. Now all we
have to do is tell him where to fire
[the football] and when, because
he’s ready to unload it at any
time.”

In order to bypass the “writer’s
embellishment” for the remainder
of this article, perhaps I should
resort to a Q&A format so we can
just get to the heart of the matter.
The following questions were
asked at Pitt’s weekly pre-game
conference yesterday by various
people.

Q: What are the comparisons
and contrasts between Van
Pelt andUSC quarterbackTodd
Marinovich?

MacPherson: I think the
advantage Marinovich has is that
he’s got that height. And he’s got
the athletic ability to run the
bootlegs, the waggles; he runs
the drop—back teams, and he can
see everything without running
around like some of the shorter
people have to do.

I think Van Pelt is a master of
the game. He’s very accurate, a
very good passer [and] knows
exactly what he’s doing and what
we’re doing.

They're both quarterbacks that
I don’t like to face. They know 
where they’re going with the
football, and they don’t get
sacked. When you see people
like that, you don’t want to play
against them, and you’d like to
have them on your side, not
against you. 0

In my old days, I never fought
over whether I had Brigitte Bardot
or Elizabeth Taylor; I’d take either
one.

Q: Would you like to see the
Pitt-Syracuse game played as
part of a conference schedule?

Mac: I don’t think it needs a
conference schedule. I think what
needs a conference schedule are
the Temples and the Rutgers vs.
Pitt and Syracuse. We need to
bring other people up in the East
so those games become more
important.

When we played Temple, we
had only 40,000 here. But now
when we play Pitt, even though
it’s a noon game on a beautiful
Saturday in the fall, it’s going to
be sold out. So we don’t need la
conference] for that. There may
be more significance to
conference games, but I think
Pitt—Syracuse stands on its own.

Q: Are you surprised at the
play of your leading tackler
(ILB) Dan Conley? I

Mac: Not at all. The guy is K)-
foot—2l, 225 lpoundsland he can
run like the wind. As soon as we
got him here, we couldn’t believe
it. He’s just going to keep getting
better. We're pleased but not
surprised. His talent is limitless.
When you talk about that kind of
size, speed and hitting, he can
program himself all the way up to
a No. 1 draft choice. That’s what
everyone is looking for.

And when a guy tells his girl to
leave him alone because it’s
football season, then that’s my
kind of guy. I try to tell that to my
wife, but she won't do it.

l

 

Q: What did you think of the
Oklahoma-Pitt score?

Mac: It was a very deceiving
score because from an offensive
standpoint, I thought Pittsburgh
did an excellent job, but they
self—destructed. They got over 400
yards in offense. So "without the
interceptions and the fumbles,
that would have been an entirely
different game. ‘

On the other side of the ball, I
want you people to take a look at
the game and decide how many
of you want to play defense
against Oklahoma. Their speed is
unbelievable! So how do you
defend that? I’m not sure.

My goodness, I think that
fullback is faster than anybody
we’ve got. We like David Walker
very much, but you realize the
fullback at Oklahoma is a 100-
meter champion. We put those
guys at wide receivers!

That was lOU’s] game, the
offensive fire power of getting
those guys outside with the
football. And Pitt was trying to do
a good job of making sure they
didn’t get it. But it’s another league

Q: How lasting is the
disappointment of the tie with
Michigan State?

Mac: The nice thing about it is
we have Pitt, because we don’t
have time to dwell on [the tie].
Quite honestly, as a head football
coach, I have to let these people
know that that game is over with,
and we have to get on with the
next one. Because of Pitt and
how we played against them last
year, I think we’ve got all we
need to get ready for this one.

Anybody that saw the lMich.
St.] game knows that our kids
busted their butts every damn
minute of that game trying to win
it. If we can’t accept a tie from
that, then we’re in the wrong
business.

And now we go on to Pitt. Isn’t
that exciting to have them and 
to be on  TV? Everybody in the
East is going to see us, and we’re
in the Carrier Dome, and it’s such
a magnificent thing. If we aren't
ready to play this game, again
we’re in the wrong business.

It’s my job to set that stage. I’m
doing it for you! Now is there
anybody in that room who doesn’t
want to play in this damn game
right now? I mean, that’s what it’s
all about!!

Goodies battle for starting spot

By Christopher Block
For Nae Pitt News

While most of the world has focused on the
battle in the Persian Gulf, those people closer to
the Pitt soccer team know of another battle that
has been waged here for three years. Now, while
this battle may not be as bloody or costly as the
one in the Middle East, the competition between
Jay Kapusta and Tim Sobelman for the starting—
goaltender position certainly has provided its
share of excitement, frustration and success.

The two players have been vying for the top
spot for four years. In their freshman year,
Kapusta, a 6—foot-2—inch senior from Venetia,
Pa., started most of the games by actually
unseating the returning goaltender that year.

The following season, playing time was split
among three players. Both Sobelman, a senior
with junior eligibility, and Kapusta had their
share of starts, with Kapusta getting the majority
to Sobelman’s four starts. Last year, Kapusta
again had an advantage over Sobelman, starting
almost all of the games, with Sobelman coming
in occasionally to play after the half.

This season, Kapusta has led the team to a 1-
1 record, registering a win over St. Francis and
a loss to Seton Hall. Sobelman, from Ephrata,
Pa., came off the bench in both of the first two
games and earned a start against Big East rival
Villanova. He made the best out of his
opportunities by shutting out the Wildcats, raising
the team record to 2-1 while remaining unscored
against all season.

While there is no bad blood between the
players, there seems to be a rivalry that has
actually helped each player’s game.

“The rivalry has been great. I think it has kept
both of us on our toes, knowing that if weplay

poorly, the other guy will be waiting in the

wings,” said Sobelman. “Both of us ~ have
benefitted from the competition.” he added.
Coach Joe Luxbacher agreed, noting that “both
are top goaltenders, and the team has benefitted
from their play.” I

As the season continues, both goalies will
continue to practice in hopes of gaining a start
and performing well for the Pitt soccer team.
One thing is for certainzif the goalie is Kapusta or
Sobelman, the team is in good hands.

THE PI’l'I‘ NEWS, Wednesday, September 19, 1990

 

Greenﬁeld

Continued from page 10
Notre Dame High School in
Sherman Oaks, Calif. The 6—foot—
1, 210-pound booter also played
tight end in high school, which
isn’t a surprise, considering his
frame looks like that of a
linebacker.

He is quick to point out that he
could not have attained the
heights that he has so far this
season if it weren't for the
exceptional punt blocking he has
received. '

“The line has been great. I was
only rushed heavily once, and
that was in the BC game, but I still
had, enough time to get the ball
off,” Greenfield said. “The punt
coverage has been really good,
too. I realize how tired they are,
especially after they come out of

the offense and have to turn
around and hold their blocks and
then sprint downﬁeld to make a
tackle.”

Greenfield is also
complimentary of his kicking
mentors. “My junior college
coach, Ray Surutto, taught me the
correct techniques to use, and
Scott O’Brien [Pitt's special teams’
coach] has helped develop other
parts of my kicking game,”
Greenfield said.

This Saturday will be
Greenfreld’s first opportunity to
kick in the perfect conditions of
the Syracuse Carrier Dome. If he
can boot a 79—yarder in the
swirling winds of Pitt Stadium, it
will be interesting to see what he
can do with only an air conditioner
blowing on it.

-If the United States is serious
about hosting the 1994 World
Cup in soccer, which it has already
been approved to do, then it

shouldn't even be considering ‘

the Louisiana Superdome as one
of the prospective sites for the
games to be played. “Why?” you
ask.

One good reason is the artiﬁcial
turf, which cheapens the game
for the spectators and is too hard
to cushion trips, dives and
knockdowns.

Second, soccer indoors? The
Men’s Indoor Soccer League has
proven that it isn’t an indoor
game. My picks for the location
are Soldier Field in Chicago, the
Rose Bowl in Pasadena, Calif.,
Stanford Stadium in Palo Alto,
Calif., the Anheuser-Busch Soccer
Complex in St. Louis, Mo., the
Orange Bowl in Miami, Fla. and
the Yale Bowl in New Haven,
Conn.

-I think that the demolition in
Norman, Okla., was not of the
real Pitt football team. I believe
the players had a wicked
flashback of the Gottfried era.

It just looked too much like the
team that got crushed last year in
South Bend by Notre Dame. We
shall see this weekend, though.

Dick MacPherson may have a
few surprises for this year’s game.
0What is Bubby Brister crying
about this week? If anybody
should be crying, it should be
Chuck Noll. After eight weeks of
practice (two in spring mini-camp,

Doug

four in Latrobe for fall camp and
the last two here in Pittsburgh),
the team still can’t figure out
what page they are on? Sounds
like an advertisement to stay in
college for four years and figure
out what the word “study” means.

oThe Pitt men’s basketball team
should do quite well this Year
with the return of Sean Miller.
Darelle Porter will be free to take

-Whatever happened to the
Craig “Ironhead” Heyward who
was here at Pitt? All he does is
block for Dalton Hillard in New
Orleans. I guess the holes are
smaller in the NFL, and his width
gets caught somewhere in
between them.

-Just thinking that the folks at
Penn State are 0-2 makes me
smile. Next year instead of Texas
and USC~on their schedule, the
Nittany Lions will probably have
Philadelphia Textile and Slippery
Rock, and Paterno will claim that
they are great interstate rivals.

-I heard Alex Van Pelt on a

‘radio call-in show the other night.

Now there is one person who
handles all the attention given to
him with the utmost class and
modesty.

oIs it too much to ask of my
fellow students to try and fill the
student section of Pitt Stadium
for a football game? I am willing
to bet that when Notre Dame
comes to town, the ND supporters
will be louder than Pitt’s. That’s
one bet I would be willing to
lose.

over yet?

-My own personal feeling is
that Pitt will be one of the last
“big” independents to join a
conference, and when it does, it
will be the Atlantic Coast
Conference’s new Northern
Division, provided 1) that it
doesn’t include basketball and 2)
that Pitt gets to play Florida State
each year in football. Another

first time. The Panthers will also

today and Thursday in
preparation for their game this

they grew used to it. It’s a lot

“The coaches complained
about the noise because they
couldn’t coach their teams,” said
Hackett. “But it’s a trade—off. The
players can’t hear either, which
they won't be able to do on

When ask if punter Brian
Greenfield had punted in the
building, Hackett quipped, “No,
he ’ll destroy the roof. They’d have
to call it the Greenfield Roof.”

Greenﬁeld set Pitt’s punting
record against Boston ‘College
with a 79-yard kick, and is
currently the. country’s fourth
leading punter.
