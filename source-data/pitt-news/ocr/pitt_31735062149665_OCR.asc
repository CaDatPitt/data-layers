Senior representatives beside Ed—;

Proposals during the past semester i
for combining the Mines and Engi-I
neering cabinets almost succeeded in!
accomplishing their end. But thei
Engineering cabinet vetoed the ac-i
tion at the last minute when a ‘‘mis— !
understanding” could not be settled.‘
One of the Mines seminars opposed
the action.

According to the proposed merger
between the Engineering and Mines
groups, the seminar representatives,
of both schools were to have met inii
a combined cabinet of a new En-‘
gineering and Mines Association.

As a result of the failure of the
merger to be completed, the combin-

i

been considered for several years,
was deferred, at least until next se-,
mester.

CONSTRUCTIVE ACTION

The purpose of the meeting, ac-
cording to the Executive Committee,
is to take some constructive action on
the present plan of Harrisburg to
cut the State grant.

At the meeting it is expected that

[there is a possibility that letters will
‘be sent to the Governor, Lieutenant-
'Governor, and Speaker of the House
of Representatives expressing student
opinion on the idea.

OPPORTUNITY FOR SFA

“This action is more important to
the student body and to the Univer-
sity than dance chairmanships and
appointments,” declared Hoeveler and

excellent opportunity for some con-
structive action by SFA.

SFA meeting in years, today's session may be an
indication that the l.h1ive1'sity’s Student g'ove‘rn-
ment organization has at last found somctliing “lin-
portautl’ to do.

Standard complaint against student govern-
ment for years has been that SEA has been able “£0
do nothing more than cllscuss routine or inconse-
quentizil matters. But today the executive com-
mittee will consider a matter which could liardly
be tcrincd incoilscqueiitial.

A reduction of $88,00l) in the biennial appropri-
ation by the legislature -will force :1 curtailment of
expenditure in almost evcr_v department of the l;'ni—
‘\’@1'Sll,V. The sum which the lT11lV'c1‘s;ity stands to
lose amounts to 8 per cent of what has o’i-tlin2.tril_§.'
been received from the state.

"DA loss of this size nicaus 2.1 smaller and less effi-
«cient teaclihig staﬁ, poorer library facilities, lower
.act.ivity budgets, fewer athletic oppt>t't1iiiitie.<;, and
decreased scholarship aid. This reduction will be
especially serious in View of the fact that for the
past few years, the University lias been operating
on a budget which has provided only for the bare
essentials of operation.

Those familiar with politics and leg‘lsla.tl\’e ap-

propriations have pointed out that some action is
necessary. Legislators must know what their con-
stituents want before they can represent them in-
tcllig‘ently. ’1‘0 present this information  repre-
scht.ativc*S"0f University students and faculty is
certainly SFA’s duty.
,_Fo_r the University ’s administrators are helpless
in this case. They cannot properly or effectively
make any complaints to Harrisburg. In fact, there
are those who feel that the present action is being
d.irc?c"tcd against’ the administration.

But if the proposed reduction is being made on .

tl1.'c7se"‘grounds, it will be futile. For the only-peo;
=pl,e*‘to'b'e hurt by an appropriation cut will be the
students and the teaching faculty.

" Since the student body has such .21 large stake
iu the matter, it must be prepared to stand back
ofthc decision of SFA wliolellcarteolly, and to give
cffective cooperation. '

And Honorary Joins
The Teaching Staff

LECTION of officers by an honorary fraternity

seldom deserves more than cursory notice in
the record of U nivcrsity events.

-But the choice of new leaders last week by Phi
Eta Sigma, honorary scholastic fraternity for
freshman men, marks the succession of 3, new ,g;ro11p
to carry on a project of great potential value to
students.

This year ’s class inPhi Eta Sigma. inaugtiratccl a
free tutorial service for students, chiefly in fresh-
man subjects. During the year, mcinbcrs spent
several hours weekly instructing students who de-
sired. special work.

If present plans materialize, this service will be
expanded next year to include a larger 1ll_lll'll):2l' of
students in more courses. Active members of the
group this year originatcditlie tutorial plan at the
llnivcrsity, and are deserving of 1*ecog'n.ltion for
the introduction of an important ineaus of help to
.f.ir.st-year students. .

More important, the work begun this year by
Phi Eta Sigma is proof that an honorary fraternity
can be more than a mere mutual admiration so-
-ciety.

performance so delicately shaded and sensitive as to
make “Dark Victory” the best acting Bette Davis has
ever dcne.

She has taken a play with a meatiness that seldom
makes its way to the screen and invested it with
punch and vigor never seen

equaled by this reviewer.

It is Bette Davis the first act-
ress of the land who takes each
line and pulls from it the last full
measure of emotion. It is Bette
Davis who plays this tragic ro-
mance with warmth and tender-
ness. ‘

but George Brent, her doctor, realizes that it is only 21

respite of a few months. One day Bette learns of her
fate and decides that she wants to die with a C()Cl{l2¢lll
glass in her hand and a cigarette between her lips.

But George Brent offers his moral support and his
love and the two of them gallantly await the coming of
the inevitable. “D:.11‘k Victory” is a brilliant victory for
Bette Davis. A

Arts

By Fred S. Robie

Log cabins, white frame mansions,
old b;icl; churches, and the best of
early store buildings stand out in the
photographic exhibit of early Amer-
ican architecture sponsored by the
Fine Arts Department on the seventh
ﬂoor.

Fifty-ﬁve photographs selected by
Leicester B. Holland, chief of the D1-
vision of Fine Arts in the Library of
Congress are exhibited in the sev-
enth ﬂoor gallery.

Chosen by the fine arts department
because they ﬁt into the American
arts course, the photographs picture
homes and churches from all over the
United States.

A uniquely constructed chimney
tops the Governor Simon Bradstreet
house, No:th Andover, 1Vlass., built in
1667. The photograph presents a
complete picture of a shuttered, clap-
board home. A small front porch
with two pillars and a ﬂared arch
above the door add a pleasant touch
to the total effect.

Divided into homes frtwp New Eng-
land states, Middle states, Southern
states, and Central states, the collec-
tion features several homes from
Pennsylvania which include the Mor-
ris House in Gezmantown built in
1772. The photographs presented a
stucco liveable town house.

One of the homes in the Southern
states group was a two-story house
tvoical of Gulf Coast architecture in
Mississippi. An old Southern home
with the full length porches on both
ﬂoors fill out the photograph.

liied (‘onto '5
Banks High;

Within the past twenty years there 
has been steadily growing on the!
University’s campus a center forl
medical an.d surgical research and?
treatment that will rank as one of the 
nation’s largest and most complete‘,
groups of buildings of the kind. ,'
Twenty years ago, two men—Dr.§
Ogden M. Edwards, Jr., and the late
Dr. Raleigh R. Huggins——saw in the
prospect of medical expansion the op-
portunity to create a medical center
for the community.

FORMER DEAN

Dr. Edwards was then acting dean
of the School of Medicine of the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh and was chair-
man of the medical committee of the
University’s board of trustees.

_Dr. Huggins was associate profes-
sor of gynecology in the School of
Medicine, and soon after became its
dean. Together they planned for the
medical center. As they saw it, the,
cen.ter should grow up around the
School of Medicine. Soon after, Dr.
John G. Bowman became chancellor,
and he shared their hopes and gave
his help.

FUTURE PROJECTS

The University purchased as a site
for a health center a full city block,
familiarly known as the H. K. Porter
estate, bound by Fifth avenue,
Lothrop, Terrace, and De Soto street,
south of the Pitt Stadium. Sites
were given to the hospitals which
wished to build there.

Projected for future construction
are a nurses’ home, a clinical labora-
tory, medical school laboratories, two
ward buildings, and a private-room
building.

TREATMENT TOTALS

After completion of the Miller hos-
pital and the Psychiatric hospital,
there will be facilities for the care
and treatment of more than 3,200 pa-
tients in hospitals of the medical cen-
ter at all times.

In terms of actual conﬁnement in
the hospitals, that means treatment
every year for thousands upon thou-
sands of persons. Approximately
75,000 persons were in hospitals of
the medical center forvtreatment last
year. Thousands more made a total
of 160,000 visits to the dispensary de-
partments of these hospitals.

Forty-ﬁve cents has been set as the

Card Methods

All students who will enter em-

mer were urged to obtain a Social
Security account number card if they
do not already have one, announces
Arno S. McClellan, manager of the
Pittsburgh Field otﬁce of the Social
Security board.

If you have not already obtained
an account card, get an application at
your post oﬂice or at the board’s ﬁeld
office located at 518 New Post Oﬁice
building, explains Mr. McClellan.

“In case you have a card, and have
lost it, apply to the Board’s ﬁeld of-
fice for a duplicate. Give the number
of your original card if you can re-
member it. Do not obtain an addi-
tional account number card; this
might cause you to ]ose some of your
beneﬁts,” he says.

“If you already have more than one
card, inform the Board’s ﬁeld ofﬁce
of all the numbers and specify which
one you want to keep.”

All but one number will be can-
celled and all wages credited to you
under all numbers will be consoli-
dated to your credit under the one
number you retain, according to Mr.
McClellan.

a series of stamps commemorating
American poets, composers, and art-
ists.

Active in the campaign under way
to issue the Foster stamp are Andre

Elliott’s design is the only one that

has been proposed so far.

Business Index
Slumps to New
Low for Year

Reduction in Steel Work
Causes Sharp Decline

Business in the Pittsburgh district
slumped to a new low level for the
year last week, according to the Bu-
reau of Business Research.

Although most of the drop wasdue
to a reduction in steel mill activity
and in blast furnace operations,orig-
inating freight shipments showed a
pronounced decline. Production of
bituminous coal, of course, was al-
most negligible. On the other hand,
the volume of trade held up remark-
ably well.

After allowance for the usual sea‘-1
sonal changes the combined index of?‘
business in the district stood at 58.9:
per cent of the 1923-25 average. The
index was only two’ points higher“
last week than in the week ended»
June 4, 1938, the lowest level reached
in the 1937-38 depression.

This index has tumbled 28.4 points.
since the ﬁrst week in December. No
doubt the index will rise in the cur-
rent week, because many of the mines
have been opened, and the seasonal

,peak in production in a number of‘

the major industries has been passed.
the bureau adds.

Despite curtailment in industrial‘
production and in coal mining opera-
tions, department store sales have
been sustained. New passenger car
registrations, however, have been
slow. Sales of Pittsburgh depart-
ment stores were more than 5 per
cent greater in the four weeks ended
May 13 than in the comparable weeks)
last year.
