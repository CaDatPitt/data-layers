Black Greek step out, h f

ANASTASIA STERANKO
Staff Writer

_ They didn’t need music to show of
their steps. _
Saturday night at Soldiers and Sailo

Memorial Hall, black fraternities and

sororities stepped out for the ﬁrst annual

Steel City Step Show.
Hosted by Damon Wﬂliarns, of the
show “ComicV1ew” on Black

Entertainment Television, and" co-hosted

by Anji from the WAMO morning show,"

the event broughtsororities and fraternities
from other universities to compete with

‘_ Pitt’s own steppers.

Proceeds from the show beneﬁted
multiplejsclerosis charities and a scholar-
ship fund.

After the national anthem and the
black national anthem were sung, the East
Side Stepping Soldiers from Peabody

High School opened the show.

Using their hands, shoulders, thighs
and the ground, the East Side Stepping
Soldiers gave the audience a taste of the
stomping and slapping they were about to
experience. L » ‘ '

Anji then announced that each of the
competing sororities and fraternities would
have 14 minutes to show the judges their
steps. The panel of judges was selected
from the competing sororities and fraterni-
ties.

The broﬂiers of Pitt’s Alpha Phi Alpha

I fraternity were theﬁrst act, opening with

the Lion King’s “Circle of Life” before

_ starting their steps.

“Tonight we are goingto show you all
how to step,” one of the brothers infoimed
the audience. I

 

Comell’s chapter of Alpha Kappa
Alpha followed the Alpha Phi Alpha broth-
ers. The sisters of Alpha Kappa Alpha
wore black suits and declared themselves
“Alpha Kappa Alpha, Inc.”

During their act, the sisters performed
part of their step routine blindfolded.

The sisters of Pitt’s Delta Sigma Theta A

stepped to an ‘80s theme, wearing off-the-
shoulder shirts with the word “delta” sten-
ciled in pink across the front.

Dressed in white suits, the brothers of
Kappa Alpha Psi drove the ladies wild
when they took off their blazers. Using
fake candy canes, the brother performed a
choreographed cane toss in their routine.
They ended their act by throwing red

panties up on stage. “It’s all about making .

sure the audience gets into it,” said David
Latimore, one of the participants from

 Omega Psi Phi brothers let their steps shine in g
Saturday night’s Steel City Step Show.

From Bowling Green University, the
brothers of Phi Beta Sigma proclaimed,
“You gotta be smooth” to be a brother in

suits, they informed the crowd that they
have not lost a show since 1993. ‘

tion they have is themselves, the brothers

U.S. Rep. Hart takes on

South American trade  

MALLORY WOMER
Staff Writer

U.S. Representative Melissa Hart, keen
to share her experiences from a trip through
Latin America, spoke to the World Aﬂ°airs
Council of Pittsburgh on Thursday night.

Protesters were on hand outside of the
event, held at The Rivers Club in downtown
Pittsburgh.

The focus of Hart’s presentation was
trade relations between South American
countries and the United States. While trav-
eling through the region, Hart stopped in
Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina and Chile. In
every country, the discussions between Hart
and political leaders revolved around inter-
national trade.

Hart, R-Pa, traveled to Latin America
throughout the month of January with a
group of members of the House of
Representatives, including Speaker of the
House Dennis Hastert, R—lll.

“WhatI noticed was a lot of unrest, a lot
of concern, especially among American
businessmen,” she said.

A man in the audience, who has been
conducting business in various Latin
American countries for more than 20 years,
echoed this concern. According to him, car-
rying a U.S. passport in some countries can
be detrimental to the success of business.

Hart believes that the only way to
improve relations is to actually travel to the
countries of South America. The visits make

it possible to further trade agreements.

According to Hart, the “hosts were surprised
by_our visit and grateful for our visit” .
When asked about the attitude of South

America toward the United States as a pos-
sible explanation for their surprise, Hart
responded, “We always have to be aware
that there is going to be a little bit of envy
because we are the superpower.”

Hart also touched on the subject of U.S.
education and its relationship to business in
foreign countries. A woman in the audience
mentioned that she deals with many adults‘
who do not know geography or a second
language, while in schools in other countries,
students are taught from. a young age to
speak a language that is not native to them.

“We haven’t started teaching languages
until the ninth grade and that is just dumb,”
Hart said “We need to start teaching chil-
dren when they are young, when they are a
sponge.” 4

As many of the people in the audience
were immigrants from Latin American
countries,.there was interest in ﬂre treatment
of immigrants in Pittsburgh. Audience mem-
bers expressed concern about the discrimi-
nation they feel from nativePittsburghers.

“There is aconceminanarealike ours,
where there is no or slow job growth, that an
employer will pay less to someone who is
willing to work for less,” Hart said. “Most
times those people are not native-bom
Americans.”

While there were many topics discussed
throughout the evening, the conversation did
retum to diplomatic relationships with Latin
America in the end Hart highlighted mea-
sures that must be taken, including pushing
forward with the Free Trade Area of the
Americas and helping to battle drug trade in
Brazil, to improve trade with and Within the
region.

MTV’s Kusbitret-urns toroots

ANDY MEDICI
Staff Writer

, While attending Clarion University of
Pennsylvania, Bob‘ Kusbit met a group of
students taking pictures of beer cans in a

A dorm. When Kusbit asked the students what

major required them to do this, they told
him, “Communications.”

“I went right to my counselor and asked
to change my major,” Kusbit said

In more recent years, though, Kusbit
served as the senior vice president at MTV
productions and was responsible for casting
Carson Daly. He oversaw such shows as
“’Total Request Live,” “Say What Karaoke”
and MTV’s armual “Spring Break” I

Kusbit has since started his own pro-
duction company and has produced MTV

‘shows such as “MADE,” “Camp Jim” and

“Boiling Points.” . V

“Boiling Points” uses actors and hidden
cameras to drive unsuspecting participants to
anger, but—Kusbit said, “In the end, ﬂrey just
think it’s funny.” . .
’ The Steeltown Entertainment Project

Pitt and Pitt in Hollywood, a student group \

with the goal of improving communication
between the entertaimnent industry, co-
sponsored the event as an initiative to
increase arts and entertainment in the city.

Carl Kurlander, a screenwriter responsi-
ble for “St. Elmo’s Fire,” helped moderate
the event, which drew an audience of about
100 in David Lawrence Hall, .

“He has many things to atone for,”
Kurlander said, listing Kusbit’s shows.

Kusbit spoke about Pittsburgh’s trouble
keeping youngpeople in town, and his belief
that, to seriously pursue a career in entertain-
rrrent, a person must leave the city.

“I think‘ you have to go and get experi-
ence before you can come back,” said

Kusbit, who grew up in Latrobe, Pa~.,near
Pittsburgh. “It would be nice to change that.”

Kusbit talked about his experiences
working for MTV as a vice president and
producer for his company, One“ Louder
Productions. ‘

“The beauty of working at MTV is you
have to think like an 18-year-old,” he said.

_ “Sometimes that gets you in trouble on the

weekend.”

Kusbit also gave pointers g>t_1_110w.,to ‘'
pitch anidea and added" tlrat, if someone is‘

rejected, he should keep trying.

“You should never be afraid; the. cre-
ative muscle must lead,” Kusbit said, “You
have to get yourself out. there.”

Kusbit recounted some of the events of I

his past that led to where he is today. While
working as a video editor in Altoona, he left
a six-second gap in a segment that went on
the air, but Kusbit kept working. , A 4

“But you don’t get ﬁred in«Altbona,” he
said “They just say, ‘Try harder.’”

Kusbit also "shared the key to succeed-
«ing in theentertainment industry.

“Start small and work your way up,”
Kusbit said. “You create your own opportu-
nities by working hard and showing other
people that you want to work hard”

The audience asked questions, includ-

ing one inquiry about the skills or majors
most useful in the entertainment industry.
Kusbit cited MTV and the many roles that
need to be ﬁlled, such" as human resources,
computer graphics and accounting.

Another question targeted the role pro-
fessional writers play in the formation of a
reality television show.

“We bring in writers to brainstorm
ideas,” Kusbit said stressing the overall
importance of learning how to write well. I

“Writing is the key to everything,” he
said.

“good loo ' g” segment, as they were intro-
duced a ﬁnal time before the ﬁve judges.
After a solo singing presentation by
Gray,_a]l participants were brought to the
stage so that the ﬁnalists could be
announced. Women’s ﬁnalists were Smith,
Cave and Tiffany Neco. In the men’s divi-
sion, it was Crockett, Benjamin Davis and
Raynard Washington. The scores were
wiped clean‘ for the last part of the competi-
tion, and each contestant was asked, “If you
could be president for a day, what would you
change and why?” I .
“First I would’ pull the troops out of

7 Iraq,’ ’ Crockett responded. “Then I would up

the budget for education and _I would
increase health care  all the social pro-

’ grams that our president has neglected.”

For the Women’s tiebreaker, Cave and
Smith were asked, “In your opinion, what is
the difference between the values that exist
today versus those of your parents,‘ and
which is better?”

Smith ended her response with, “No T

matter what this culture tells me, no matter
what this society tells me, I know that the
strongest and most consistent thing has been
my family and their values.”

‘ The event’s large, animated crowd

brought Pitt’s black community together.

“I think this pageant shows true repre-
sentation of what black people can do on this
campus and the role models’ that they can be
to other students,” Sims said.

“It allows us to never forget that we are
all kings and queens,” Patterson said

In the Women’s competition, Neco
received second rurmer-up and Cave won
ﬁrst runner-up. For the men, Washington
was the second runn’er—up and Davis was the
ﬁrst runner-up.

The king and queen each won a $350 -

prize, half of which they will receive now,
with the other half to be awarded when their

Franken political “agnostic” in USO, shares strong views at Pitt

Franken, page 1

“We celebrated Hanukkah right there in
the foyer just as a 11- you,’” Franken said

Franken told the story of his latest USO
tour to a sold—out crowd in Carnegie Music
Hall Saturday night

The former “Saturday Night ‘Live”
writer and performer and best—selling author
also spoke about his recent clash with Fox
News and took numerous shots at President
George W. Bush who, in November,
Franken said is “going down.”

“We need to ask some tough ‘ques-
tions,” Franken said. “What did the presi-
dent know? Why didn’t he know it? Did he
understand his intelligence brieﬁngs? Did he
know he didn’t understand his intelligence
brieﬁngs? These questions must be asked
often, and in an accusing manor.”

Franken spoke as part of “Not Quite

Kosher,” a fundraiser for Jewish life at Pitt
and Carnegie Mellon University, and for
Table to Table, an organization that feeds the
hungry in Israel.

The night also featured the Chicago

comedy troupe Second City and sketches by =

Jewish students from Pitt and CIVIU.-The
event was a joint production of the United
Jewish Federation, the Jewish University
Center’ and the Sanford N. Robinson
Memorial Lecture Series. '

Daniel Marcus, assistant director of the
JU C, said the event took weeks of work.

“This has been a real great success in
terms of student leadership,” Marcussaid

Marcus added that the organizations
were not afraid to host a performer as politi-
cally forthright as Franken.

“He is here as, a comedian, not a politi-
cal analyst,” Marcus said

Despite this, as soon as he arrived on

' stage, Franken took aim at Bush.

“Words are not this president’s strong
suit,” Franken said, also criticizing the pres-
ident for initially calling military operations
in Afghanistan “Operation Infinite Justice”
and the war against terrorism “a crusade.”

“[Bush campaign strategist] Karl Rove
should have gone to the streets of
Washington, D.C. and waved down a

Pakistani cab driver and ran this stuff by’

him,” Franken said.

“‘Inﬁnite Justice? Please do not call it
that. OnlyAllah can dispense inﬁnite justice.
What else have you got?.What? A crusade!
Oh, no!’” Franken said, speaking the imag-
ined response.

Franken also criticized the president’s
economic record. -

“At the start of the 2000 [presidential]
campaign, when Bush said he was against
nation-building, ‘I didn’t realize he only
meant our nation,” Franken said.

Franken noted that, d11ring the com-
bined terms of both President Bush and his
father, more jobs were lost than created in
the United States.

“If Bushes had nm the country since
inception to present day, not a single
American would have worked,” Franken
said “We would all be hunter-gatherers.”

Franken also commented on the war in
Iraq. He said he feels the Bush administra-
tion lied about weapons of mass destruction,
but this time last year, he was not so certain.

“I was very agnostic about the war,”
Franken said. _

Agnostic as Franken was, he decided to,
entertain troops in Iraq, Kuwait, Afghanistan
and Uzbekistan last December. It was his
fourth USO tour. ,

“I always get more from USO -tours
than I put in,” Franken said. “Don’t let any-
one tell you differently. We Democrats love
our troops.”

Franken’s USO act was apolitical. After
Saddam Hussein was captured, Franken
irnpersonated him in handcuffs and cos-
tume. ,

“I used to have 20 or 30 palaces, but
when ﬂie kids move out I wanted to down-
size,” Franken said, doing his best Hussein.
“The hole you found me in was my favorite

hole. I had ﬂie air duct and I could roll over.” *

, When troops were driving Franken out’
of Baghdad one person pointed out the
building where Hussein was being held.
Franken asked permission to do his impres-
sion in front of Hussein but was not allowed.

Franken also discussed his clash with
the cable network Fox News, which began

at a Book Expo last May when Franken pro-
moted his latest “Lies and the Lying Liars
Who Tell Them: A Fair and Balanced Look
at the Right.”

Fox News personality Bill O’Reilly,
featured on the cover of “Lies,” shared a

panel discussion with Franken and shouted ,

at himpto “shut-up,” calling him an‘ “idiot”

Days later, Fox News sent Franken’s
publisher a letter saying that they intended to
sue him for using their motto “fair and bal-
anced” ‘in the title of his book Franken was
not intimidated.

" “I’ve been in this business 30 years, and-
satire is protected speech, even if the object
of the satire doesn’t get it,” Franken said.

Franken went to court several months
later and the judge dismissed the case as
“wholly without merit.”

“They have been using ‘fair and bal-
anced’ much less since then,” Franken said
“I think it is because the judge gave them a
new motto: ‘Fox News: Wholly ‘Without
Merit” —

Franken ended his set with one last,
more seriously toned, shot at Bush.

“After 9-11, I had never seen this coun-
try or the world so united,” he said.

“This president had an opportunity to
lead the world into a new American century
of mutual sacriﬁce and mutual purpose, and
he blew it,” Franken added “He blew it, and

there is a lot of anger, and that’s why he’s

going down.”

Unsafe for any party, in any election

Here he goes again. .
Ralph Nader, the self-described
consumer advocate and “party crash-
er” from the 2000 election, announced

, yesterday that he will run for president .

again in 2004.
‘ Terry McAuliffe, chairman of the
Democratic National Committee, has
said that Nader’s involvement won’t
matter much, and that Nader has no
base of support. While his statements
are very brave, it’s hard to believe that
he’s really not concerned.

Many Democrats blame the loss in

' the last presidential election on Nader,

who received a little less than 3 per-
cent of the vote.‘ Among that 3 percent,
however, were more than. enough
votes to swing the states of New
Hampshire and Florida to Al Gore,
provided Gore had received all ‘of
Nader’s votes. -

Nader claims that he’s trying to
break up the two-party duopoly, and
has said that there is little. difference

between Democrats and Republicans, 9‘

who are beholden to the same special
interests. He also embraces a platform
of left-wing issues, such as higher
taxes, drug decriminalization, high
tariffs on imported goods and a more

. isolationist foreign policy.

Still, for the Green Party, Nader’s
not the w_ay to go.

Nader has no chance of winning.
In fact, hehas an infinitesimally small

chance of even getting 5 percent of the
vote, which would grant him millions
in federal matching funds to run again
in 2008. He does have a chance of get-
ting President George W. Bush re-
elected and thus dooming Green Party
members to another four years of an
administration that is diametrically
opposed to all of their views.

But the Greens don’t have to nom-
inate him.

The Green Party
opportunity to prove that ‘they-are a
relevant, respectable third party and

refuse to endorse Nader. Anyone who

believes that there is no difference
between Bush and Democratic fron-
trunner John Kerry is delusional, and
Kerry has views much closer to those
of the Greens, and actually might win.
Byendorsing Kerry, the Greens could
prove that they have some sense of the
political landscape and that they pos-
sess the quality most admired in

politicians of yore: the ability to com-

promise. . ,

And "the Dems can help them-
selves out, too. Howard Dean, who
enlivened many youngpeople with his
more liberal platform, has yet to
endorse a candidate for president.

Nader as a similar candidate. Dean,

 A historical, as well as theological, View of the Passion

Mel Gibson’s new film, “The
Passion of the Christ,” will open
nationwide tomorrow. Writing on Feb.
17 in “Gibson’s ‘Passion’ depicts love,
not hate,” Eric‘ Miller points out that

‘much of the controversy over the ﬁlm

centers on a verse in Matthew (27:25)
in which the Jewish crowd ‘declares,
“Let his blood be on us and on our
children.” Miller acknowledges that
“this verse has been used as a justiﬁca-
tion for hate,” but quickly moves from
a consideration of this historical reali-
ty to make a theological statement.

Miller concludes his theological
argument as follows: “When consid-
ered holistically, the story of Christ’s
cruciﬁxion is loaded with meaning and
defined by complex interactions
between men and God. To Whittle it
down to anti—Semitism is to complete-
ly miss the point, and no one can
soundly use it as a justification for
hate.”

I think that Miller meant to be
speaking prescriptively in the last sen-
tence. As he acknowledges early on in
his column, this statement does not
Work very Well on the descriptive level
—-— soundly or not, people have used
Matthew as “justification for hate.”
Indeed, the concerns of most Jewish
and Christian leaders about the ﬁlm
have less to do with theology and more
to do with history and sociology.

At the beginning of the ﬁfth centu-
ry, Augustine outlined a theological
framework for the tolerance of Jews
within a Christian society that strongly

inﬂuenced the Catholic Church’s poli-
cies toward the Jews through the
Middle Ages and well into the modern
period: that Jews are not to be forcibly
converted or killed, and that the Jews’
adherence to «
the Old
Testament tes-
tifies to the
truth of
Christianity.
But the
theological
nuances of this
position —— his
writing that
Jews are right-
ly degraded,
but not

“Attending to the p L
concerns of people who
have suﬂered immense

persecution as a result of "his , movie on

be intermpted in the middle for the
kind of theological disclaimer that
Miller provides. Hence, Gibson has
prudently removed the phrase from

Matthew 27:25 from the subtitles. For

the Aramaic
speakers in the
audience, it’s
still there on
the soundtrack.

Miller also
writes that, “if
Gibson bases
everything in

still have a

acting as wit-

lost on the larger medieval population,
not trained in theological dialectic.
Most people today, like most peo-
ple in the Middle Ages, are not trained
to think theologically. And the images
and sounds of a well.-made motion pic-
ture are as powerful (or moreso) than
the images and sounds of a medieval
passion play. Gibson said on
“Primetime Live” that movies cannot

this does not

mean that the

film offers an

accurate history of the death of Jesus.
The Gospels were all written long after
the events they purport to record. t
We should remember that Pontius

Pilate was apparently a brutal colonial
governor unlikely to allow himself to’

be swayed, by a crowd of Jews, and
that cruciﬁxion was a punishment used
by the Romans against hundreds of
Jews for various forms of political
sedition. As ‘ a historian, I read the

account in Matthew not as “what real-
ly happened” at the time of Jesus’
death, but as a‘ narrative being told a
generation or two later by and for “a
community of early Christians in the
process of separating itself from the
Jewish community, and hence as evi-
dence of the collective memory and
religious identity of that later commu-
nity. .

Gospels literally as an act of faith. And

good wages and too apathetic to organize; about the
high staff turnover rates and strict opposition to

mal training practices or the vagaries inherent in the
term “natural ﬂavoring.” But I guess what these ide-

an omelet without breaking a few eggs, and you
can’t make a large order of fries without breaking a
few high school sophomores. It’s the nature of
progress, and I ﬁnd it goes down smooth with sweet

In 2001, Eric Schlosser dropped the book"‘Fast

CHAD EBERLE
Senior Staff Writer

This list was not hard to make.
Truth be told, 2003 was_ no 2002.
Narrowing all the good films of 2002
down to the 10 bestwas nearly impos-
sible. 2003, on the other hand, just
didn’t offer many to consider. Still,
there were a couple of great ﬁlms and
a handful of very good ones. Here are
my faves: -

l0._ ‘_‘Capturing the Friedmans”

This film is downright hard to
watch. But it is important. It needs to
be watched. Director Andrew J arecki
creates ’ an enormously compelling
documentary about a family torn apart
by the revelation of a dark secret and
a Salem—esque community in the grips
of hysteria. We watch up close as the
Friedmans come unglued in footage of
an uncomfortable home video. The

best documentary of the year.

9. “Elephant” ,

‘ Pivoting his school—Violence
drama on leisurely, mundane character
exchanges, Gus Van Sant finds beauty
when he doesn’t seem to be looking
for it. When a character walks from
one location to another, the director
doesn’t cut out the trek between, he
shows every step in long tracking
shots. We come across the same
moments again and again, with a
looming nightmare taking shape a lit-
tle more each time. When it comes, it
is shattering.

8. “School of Rock”

Horror, the most consistently dis-

“Blair Witch,” thanks to sharp direc-
tion by Danny Boyle. He manages to

script by Alex Garland, whose ‘rage
virus’ angle allows for what is essen-
tially a zombie film to have fast and
ferocious killers. That’s called having
your cake and eating it too.

6. “American Splendor”

ing biopic with the credibility of a

worthy of the term “masterpiece.”

2. “Lost in Translation”

I can’t think of any praise that has-
n’t already been heaped on Sofia

effort. I will say that in this, the
awards season, people seem to be con-

two very good comedies, “Bad Santa”

ﬂocked to junk like “Pirates of the

Conceptual Spirituality from a new Brooklyn band

Spirituality

The Desert Fathers
Threespheres Records

‘t.‘n’.‘r

Recommended if you like:
indie rock from New York

What happens when three indie-
rock veterans from Brooklyn collabo-
rate with a well known indie-rock pro-
ducer? Well, at least in this instance,
you get a band named The Desert
Fathers — originally an ancient monas-
tic sect of Christianity that sought
enlightenment in the deserts of Egypt
in the third century A.D. But don’t be
fooled, this isn’t exactly Christian rock.

In a recent interview with the
Albuquerque Electronic Journal, lead
singer and guitarist Acquaman said that
the signiﬁcance of the band’s name has
everything to do with its origin. The
Desert Fathers of Brooklyn imagine
themselves as a group not necessarily
looking for a sound that tests the

boundaries of musical genre, but rather.
to just create their reality for their ~

music.

And that is exactly what Acquaman
(guitarist), The Real (bass) and Levitas
(drums) have done in conjunction with
producer Steve Albini. Three years,
two engineers and seven studios later,

they have ﬁnally released their debut
album Spirituality.

Concept album, anyone? Perhaps
that would be an understatement. In the
span of 10 songs in just under 29 min-
utes, Spirituality offers a soundscape
that blends the most bizarre mixture of
tape loops, over-dubs, guitar distor-
tions, voice—overs and a whole array of
other terms that are just for you if sen-
sory perception overdrive is. your bag.

I later found that the liner notes aid
in. listening and comprehending the

overall intentionof the album — nar-

rating the story of human evolution.
Tracks four, “Evolution,” and eight,
“Focus,” are standouts because they
seem to be.where the quality of musi-
cianship peaks. In these songs,
Spirituality is the most melodic with
both vocals and instruments.

The first song on the album,
“Agnus Dei,” sounds like a tripped out
monastic choir song.’ We are offered

voices repeating “agnus dei,” with'

samples of chirping birds playing in the
background. -
Tracks two, “A Practical Joke,”

and three, “Peace in That,” are just

straight-forward, in-your-face grunge

— multi-layered with heavy guitar dis-

tortionfthick bass and lots of fatffloor
tom. For a second I felt like I was 14
again listening to Nirvana; especially

with whining and screaming vocals
that are indecipherable without the help"
of the liner notes.

The Desert Fathers have created .a
soundscape in Spirituality that can be

hauntingly beautiful at its best conven- .

tions of indie rock ‘make Spirituality
sound like a big pile of noise. The artis-
tic expression is evident in the style of
the Desert Fathers. And while they may

be well on their way to creating their
own sound, there are still a few kinks to
work out before they make the final
trek out of the wilderness.

The Desert Fathers will be performing

on Tuesday at The Smiling Moose. F or? '

This isn’t a “Eurotrip” so much as it is Euro trash

Eurotrip

Starring Scott Mechlowicz,
Jacob Pitts, Michelle
Trachtenberg, Travis Wester
Directed by Jeff Schaffer

1/2

Leave it to the creators of “Road
Trip” to make a movie like
“Eurotrip.” In this time of tarnished
diplomacy, this film truly epito-
mizes why people across the pond
hate the United States so much.

Unlike other movies that have
pandered to the adolescent male
demographic, this one seems to
resort to tactics that are not only
sad and pathetic, but also insulting.
The difference between this movie
and the gross-out teen comedies
associated with it is that many of
these films somewhat successfully
combine offensive material and
humor. t

“Eurotrip” just seems to pull
every tired stereotype '‘ from
European culture and run with it. In
other words, “Eurotrip” is a foul
and intolerable waste that makes
“American Pie” look like a top
prizewinner at the Cannes films fes-
tival.

The movie starts out with Scott

Thompson (Scott Mechlowicz), a
gangly high-school graduate who,
after being dumped by his unfaith-
ful girlfriend, looks forward to
a summer internship at his
father’s medical practice. His
plans change, however, when
he finds out that the German
guy he has been e-mailing
over the past few months turns _
out to be a hot chick. Deciding
that he must declare his love
for her, he and his crude,
horny sidekick Cooper (Jacob
Pitts) leave for a trek across
Europe. And they bring their
two high school friends with
them, the twins (Michelle
Trachtenberg of “The
Adventures of Pete’ and Pete”
and Travis Wester).

During their trip to .
Germany, the group is con-
fronted with drunken, British
soccer hooligans, an annoying
French performance artist, an
overly . touchy—feely* Italian .- “
train mate‘, i and, ‘of’ course, A
kinky Amsterdam prostitutes.
If that isn’t overkill, imagine a
little German boy drawing a mus-
tache on himself and marching
while giving the Nazi salute.
There’s something that will piss off
everyone.

The humor that does not depend frontal disaster. For those more

Three guys take the stage to screaming fans.

Panthers df etignia» 67-58

RYAN WALKER
Senior Staff Writer

MORGANTOWN, W. Va. ,— One hun-
dred was the magic number in Pitt’s game

against West Virginia on Saturday night. -

A For the Mountaineers, the game
marked the 100th anniversary of their
men’s basketball teani’s first game, which
coincidentally enough was against Pitt.

For the Panthers, a win would give
the senior class its 100th career victory.

The game started out the way any fan
would picture “The Backyard Brawl”.
With four ties and 10 lead changes.in the
first half, it was like watching two heavy-
weight prizefighters slug it out in the
ring. \ ’ ’ _ I
. “We knew coming into this game that
they were going to be hyped behind their

A crowd, being, that‘ it was the 100th

anniversary,” said senior guard J aron

Brown. “We just tried to go out there and handle it as

best we could.”

But not even the voice of former West
superstar and NBA Hall-of—Famer Jerry West was
‘ enough to push the Mountaineers past the Panthers,

 

rg. .,

Chevon Troutman tries to break free during Pitt’s Win over West Virginia.
Troutman and Julius Page led the Panthers with 15 points each.

as Pitt won its 24th game of the season, 67-58.

In front of a deafening crowd, West Virginia held
.a 28-26 lead with 6:10 remaining in the first half.
The lead was short—lived-and would be the last for
the Mountaineers, however, and the Panthers were

Virginia

able to regain momentum and takeover.

Seconds after falling behind, Brown
found Julius Page, who knocked down an
open three pointer. The three-point shot
was the beginning of a 10-0 Pitt run that
allowed the Panthers to go into the lock-
er room with an eight—point lead.

Head coach_Jamie Dixon was proud
of the way his team handled its first-half
adversities.

After freshman forward Chris Taft"

picked up his second foul only 2231 into
the game, Dixonwas forced to turn to his
bench to help pick up the slack.

“We overcame a lot of obstacles,”
Dixon said. “I didn’t get nervous." We
have Mark McCarroll and Toree Morris.”

Pitt played hard-nosed defense at the
end of the ﬁrst half and early in the sec-
ond half. The Panthers did not allow the
Mountaineers to hit a shot from the field
over a stretch of 9:31.

West Virginia head coach John Beilein said that
Pitt’s defense simply would not give up easy shots.
West Virginia shot just 35 percent from the field.

Assistant Sports Editor 1

MORGANT OWN, W.Va. —— With 6: 10
left on the clock in the first half, the Pitt
men’s basketball team trailed the West
Virginia Mountaineers 28-26, but that
was before a momentum-shifting run.

Pitt is shooting 33 percent from
three-point range on the season, but it
was able to hit timely three-pointers to
go on a 10-0 run at the end of the first
half in its 67-58 victory over West
Virginia on Saturday night. The
Panthers shot 50 percent from beyond
the arc in the game, nailing six of 12
three-pointers.’ _

“I think we have a better three-
point-shooting team than our numbers
indicate,” Pitt head coach Jamie Dixon
said. ,

The No. 4 Panthers used a 12-2 run
to close the first half and take a 38-30
lead. West Virginia employs a 1-3-1
defense, which allows it to double-
team the ball handler, but Pitt was able
to make some adjustments.

“We changed our attack on the 1-3-
1 defense, [which gave] us a few more
open looks,” Dixon said.

With Pitt down by two points, Pitt
senior guard Julius Page, along with
redshirt sophomore guard Carl Krauser,
went to work. Page and Krauser com-
bined for the Panthers’ final 12 points
of the first half.

“I was just thinking that we needed
a bucket,” Krauser said, “so I just want-
ed to make a play. You never want to
play behind, especially on the road,
because it can get really loud in there,
as you heard today.”

Pitt forward Jaron Brown started '

the run by dishing the ball off to Page,
who knocked down a three—pointer to
give the Panthers a 29-28 lead. It was a
lead that Pitt would never give back.

Neither team would score again for
nearly three minutes. Finally, Krauser
nailed the next ﬁeld goal in the game
with a basket from beyond the are off
of a Page assist.

Wrestling unable to hold on in final dual meet

ALAN SMODIC
Staff Writer

Pitt’s dual meet season came to
an end on Thursday night, although

perhaps not the way the Panthers’

would have wanted it.

The Panthers started off strong

and could have won several later
matches, but nothing seemed to go
their way.
The Fighting Scots of Edinboro
who are undefeated —in the
Eastern Wrestling League — came
into the Fitzgerald Field House and
stole a win from the Panthers, 21-
13.

The loss dropped Pitt’s record to
8-6 overall and 5-2 in the EWL,
while Edinboro improved to 9-4 and
6-0.

Pitt’s Drew Headlee got things
going with a 9-0 major decision in
the first match.

The major decision gave Pitt the
early 4-0 lead against the favored
Scots. “

“He stirs the soup and creates
momentum,” said head coach Rande
Stottlemyer. “He does a great job of
it, and he has been sick recently,
too.” i ‘

Jacob Gray of Edinboro record-
ed a major decision for the Scots in

the very next match at 133 pounds
over Pitt’s Mike Ciotti. Gray used a

‘combination of four takedowns on

his way to a 10-2 victory.

At 141 pounds, Pitt’s Ronald
Tarquinio recorded a takedown just
as time expired in the first period.
Tarquinio used two more takedowns
before the match was over to earn an
8-2 decision over Edinboro’s Ron
Doppelheuer. _

“He had great focus
deserved to win. He wrestled a good
kid, too,” Stottlemyer said.

The next match, at 149 pounds,
was a tough one to swallow for Pitt.
Freshman Matt Kocher recorded a
takedown and two near-fall points to
take a 4-0 lead into the third period
over the Scots’ Deonte Penn.

Kocher kept Penn contained just
about all period andlooked as if he
was headed for victory, until Penn
reversed Kocher for two points and
earned three near-fall points as time
expired. »

Penn walked away victorious 5-

_4, with all his points coming in the

last 13 seconds of the match.

“It was a great match and defi-
nitely not a lack of effort on Matt’s
part. A little of inexperience may
have come in,” Stottlemyer said.

_“He was upset because he knew it

and"

was a big match.” ,

It looked to be a momentum
killer for Pitt, but not in the eyesof
Justin Nestor.

Nestor took charge for Pitt by
defeating Edinboro’s Eric Ring 3-0

‘ in the 157-pound match up and gave

Pitt a 10-7 lead. A

In the 165-pound match, Pitt’s
Zach Doll was taken down five
times "as he suffered a major deci-
sion loss to the Scots’ Matt King.
King owned a 33-2 record coming
into the match and was ranked No. 3
in his weight class.

“King’s~a good guy. He’s pretty
tough,” Stottlemyer said. '

Edinboro’s 174-pound wrestler
Nate Yetzer —- ranked No. 8 and 29-
3 on the year —- earned the Scots a
second straight major decision.
Yetzer recorded. an 11-3 victory over
Pitt’s Francis Iorfido to give
Edinboro the 15-10 advantage.

“Francis just wrestled on the
edge a bit and things just didn’t
seem to fall-his way,” Stottlemyer
said. “He could have won that
match.” A

Pitt’s’,Mike Croyle fe1l'to Alex
Clemsen, 5-1, at 184 pounds for
Edinboro’s third straight win.
Clemsen — ranked No. 18 and 19-2

on the year «s—-- ‘scored a first-period if

takedown and an escape point in the
second to lead. 3-Oat the end of the
period. ’

Croyle escaped to start the third
period, but Clemsen added a second
takedownnnear the end of the period.

Edinboro’s Mike LaBella lost to
Pitt’s Josh Birt at 197 pounds to end
the Scots’ winning streak. Birt used
two takedowns to count for four of
his six points in his 6-1 victory to
narrow Edinboro’s lead to 18-13.

The Panthers needed a pin in the
heavyweight bout to give them the
win, but Travis Shirley fell short in

’a 7-2 loss to Joe Hennis. Hennis was

able to counter Shir1ey’s first
attempt for a takedown and added
two more takedowns and an escape
point for the win to give Edinboro

-the 21-13 overall victory.

Pitt’s wrestlers will now head to
the EWL Championships the week-
end of March 6 and 7 at
Bloomsburg, Pa.

Any Wrestler who places in the
top three in his weight class will
earn a trip to. the NCAA

Visors may not be the cool thing to wear, but they’re safe

see    V! aw

    
 

Hockey players are stereotyped as the toughest men

in all of sports. They take a stick to the face and fall to ,

the ice with blood ﬂowing profusely onto the cold sur-
face. 'I‘wenty-ﬁve stitches and 10 minutes later, they are
back on the ice, scoring goals. But I think it’s time for
these tough men to make an attempt to prevent injuries.

The National Hockey League needs to implement a
rule forcing all players to wear full face guards, or at

least full visors. Players argue that a full face guard or a '
 visor will prevent them from seeing the ice clearly, but

the fact is that one puck to the face and they may never
see anything clearly again. .

Just ask St. Louis Blues defenseman Al Maclnnis.
He is out indeﬁnitely after.a high stick cut his eye and
partially detached his retina. Now the former James
Norris ‘Memorial Trophy, winner cannot _see clearly out
of "his lefteye and reports noticing several blind’ spots.
Maclnnis will miss the rest of the season and could be
forced into retirement withthis injury — an injury that
could have been prevented with the use of a full face

guard or a visor.

Philadelphia Flyer Jeremy Roenick is the recent
victim of not having a full face guard on. He was hit by
a puck on Feb. 13 in the Flyers’ win over the Rangers.
The puck was ﬁred toward the net from the point, off

' the stick of Ranger defenseman Boris Mironov. The

impact of the puck shattered Roenick’s jaw and left the
All-Star unconscious. He is now out for the season and
even mentioned that retirement was a possibility.

Again, a mask could have also prevented this
injury. And it’s not like Roenick didn’t see this coming.
He was involved in a similar incident during a practice,
according to the Philadelphia Inquirer, back on Jan. 7 of
this year. » .

i The team was practicing power—play drills and
teammate Mark Recchi shot the puck on net. The puck
hit Roenick right in the jaw. He was takenin for X—rays,
and, fortunately, they came back negative. ,

Another incident occurred in ' 2000 when former
Maple Leaf Bryan Berard lost all his vision in one eye
after‘ taking a stick to the face. He miraculously still
plays hockey, but he will never see out of his injured
eye again. —

Players in NCAA and in the North American junior
system are required to wear full face guards e— although
the junior system allows players over 18 years of age to

switch to a half shield. So why does the  ignore the

dangers of not protectingtheir faces?
Even the great one, Wayne Gretzky, now part
owner and managing general partner of the NI-IL’s

Phoenix Coyotes, agrees with me.

“If someone would have said to me, ‘You’ve got to
wear a visor,’ I’d have said, ‘You’ve got to be crazy,’
because I grew up not wearing a visor,” Gretzky said.
“But so many kids now, they grow up wearing visors,
and _I encourage the young guys who come into the
NHL not to take them off. There’s no reason to. They’re
used to wearing the visors, it’s protecting their eyes,

‘ and, for their own safety and their own health, if I were
them, I would keep them on. That’s just my personal
opinion.” »

This was a quote in response to the fact that the East I

‘ Coast Hockey League implemented a rule this past year
that all players must use visors.
Why are hockey players so stubborn in their refusal
to protect themselves? .
Jason Christie, head coach of the ECHL Peoria
Rivermen—— who spent 11 years playing in theAI-IL and
ECHL — answered that question best in an interview
placed on the ECHL’s ofﬁcial Web site.
“It’s like trying to give a kid a curfew,” he said,
_ adding, “I didn’t wear a visor, and I wouldn’t, although
we respect guys who do. I paid with a broken nose +
13 times.” .
The stereotype is correct —- they are the toughest,
just not the brightest. ‘

Jimmy Johnson is a staﬁ‘ writer for The Pitt News and
he, without his ﬁ4ll face guard on, suffered a broken
nose while typing this column — 13 times.

‘A few things to look forward to in the second half of the NBA season

sac     vi aw

  
 

This is for the 12 other National
Basketball Association fans out there.
The few, the proud, the NBA junkies. We
are a dying breed, but the NBA is better
than it has ever been in the post-Michael
Jordan era — Chicago only, ‘the
Washington Wizards thing never hap-
pened. ' 4

This is a look at 10 things that this
NBA watcher thinks are of key impor-
tance in the second half of the season and
beyond. 0

No. 10: Who won the NBA title last
year? '

Does anyone remember? The San
Antonio Spurs did, and havebeen play-
ing pretty good basketball recently. They
still have the best player in the game in
Tim Duncan, yet never get a mention
because of their sometimes-boring play.

Hey, Oakland; guess what NBA
team most plays like the Pittsburgh
Panthers? Both teams play great defense
and run their offensive sets to perfection.

No. 9. Ninth place. That is where the
Cleveland Cavaliers will ﬁnish in the
East this year. Soon-to-be.Rookie of the
Year LeBron James will do his best, but
the Cavs are just not there yet.

Now that this is James’ team com-
pletely, it is only a matter of time before
he explodes and averages close to a
triple-double per game. Imagine the
Cavs losing the rest of the year, and get-
ting a top-ﬁve pick? One more big-time
player, and this team is ready to com-
pete.

No. 8. In eighth place are the Dallas
Mavericks.
Apparently, defense wins champi-

onships, and basketball games, yet

someone forgot to tell Dallas. It is espe-
cially bad when Antoine Walker com-
plains about lack of defense, since he
doesn’t play any himself.

No. 7. The Memphis Grizzlies are play-
off-bound for the ﬁrst time in history.

Is there a doubt that Jerry West is the
best executive in the NBA or that Hubie
Brown is the NBA coach ‘of the year?
Now, how good will this team be next
year with the addition of one more big-
time player? Paging Kobe Bryant.

No. 6. Six is the number of teams that
have a shot at wimiing the NBA title.

. San Antonio, Sacramento, Los
Angeles, Minnesota, Indiana and New

Jersey all have a chance to win the NBA
title. With Ron Artest’s pending surgery,
the Pacers will be in trouble, and could
be replaced on this list by the Detroit
Pistons. By adding Rasheed Wallace on
Thursday, the Pistons perhaps have
added enough offense to make a run, but
it is not likely.

No. 5. Speaking of Detroit, what hap-
pened to Darko Milicic?

It took the Pistons and the rest of the
NBA this long to realize that he needs
more seasoning to be ready for the NBA.
Only in the NBA will a team invest the
No. 2 overall pick on an unknown. '

Detroit got what it deserved, and
how much better would it be with

Carmelo Anthony playing next to

Tayshaun Prince?

No. 4. Who is this year’s NBA MVP?

Three candidates all have great
chances 4- Peja Stoj akovic, Kevin
Gamett and the reigning MVP Tim
Duncan. Even though Minnesota has lost
the league’s best record, the season that
Gamett is having can’t be dismissed.

This will be the year that Minnesota
gets out of the first round, and Gamett is
the main reason. Give him the award
now unless the Wolves collapse com-
pletely. '

No. 3. “We will see you at the ﬁnals,”
boasted the New Jersey Nets’ Jason Kidd

after the All-Star game. -

The NBA’s hottest team has won 12
straight, and since Byron Scott left,
seems invincible. The Nets’ faithful
should thank Kidd for getting Scott ﬁred
and helping this team get to the NBA
finals for the third straight year this sea-
son.

No. 2. Allen Iverson — where will he
end up?
The Sixers have some problems.

* They havetoo much money tied up into

players no one wants. Iverson will never
be able to get the complementary players
he needs, and the 76ers are left with only
one play — trade Iverson. What is his
market value, though?

Tracy McGrady straight up for
“AI?” Who knows, but this summer
might be the last for Iverson in the City
of Brotherly Love. I

No. 1. In the end, it will be New Jersey,
who deserves a title after the last two
years of disappointment.

The Nets will defeat the San Antonio
Spurs in seven games, and Jason Kidd
will win the MVP. Of course, that is this
NBA junkie’s opinion, and I could be
wrong.

Matt Miloszewski is a staﬁ' writer for The
Pitt News and wishes everyone loved the
NBA as much as he and a few of his
ﬁiends do.

Page and Troutman lead Pitt to
sixth straight win against WVU

Win, page 13

“Pitt’s defense was probably the
main reason we didn’t shoot it well,”
Beilein said. “We just didn’t make
shots when we needed to make them.”

Unlike the first half, there were no
lead changes in the second half. It was
typical Pitt basketball — tough team
defense and unselﬁsh play on offense.

It was the 17th time this season
that Pitt’s defense held its opponent
under 60 points. Only three times in 26
contests has a team scored 70 or more
points on the Panthers.

Pitt (24—2, 10-2) had four players
score in double figures. As a team, the
Panthers shot 56 percent from the ﬁeld
and 50 percent from three—point land‘.
West Virginia’s zone defense gave the
Panthers plenty of open looks from the
perimeter.

“They left us open,” Page said.
“They want you to take open threes,
we just didn’t want to take the quick
ones.

“We wanted to wait a minute and
work it around, then take what was
there, and that’s what they gave us. It
was tough to come in here and win.
They came out and played hard. Every
game counts right now, and we’re

playing for a No. 1 seed.” ’
The Panthers will be on the road

again on Tuesday when they travel to ‘

Georgetown to face the Hoyas. Tip-off
is set for 7:30 p.m. Even though
Georgetown has had a disappointing
season thus far, the Panthers know that
they cannot afford to lose focus in any
Big East road game.

“We just know that every game
counts,” Page said. “We can’t be wor-
ried about what Georgetown is doing.
We just have to worry about getting
better and doing the things we’ve got
to do.”

Page has a history with
Georgetown; he remembers the time
he amazed fans when he dunked on
former Georgetown center Ruben
Boumtje—Boumtje during his freshman
year. Page said that with his ankle at
100 percent, he might have a few
tricks up his sleeve for Tuesday’s
game.

“They didn’t forget about it, and I
didn’t forget about it,” Page said of the
time he dunked on Georgetown’s mon-
strous seven—footer. “You never know
what I’ll do. I might catch somebody
off guard.eI haven’t dunked on any-
body in along time, so they might be
sleeping on me.”

Panthers’ outside shooting opens up opportunities for Troutman in the paint

Shooting, page 13

“They run at you when you"re "shooting threes,”
Page said. “I was in the air and saw Carl [Krauser] out
of the corner of my eye, and I just kicked it out to
him, and he made the shot. I think that’s what really
turned the game for us. After that, the momentum
shifted.” ’

Krauser returned the favor on‘Pitt’s next basket,

- finding Page for another three pointer. With‘ the score

35-28, Krauser went to the charity stripe and knocked
down one of two foul shots.

The Panthers went on a 10-0 run that covered a
stretch of 5:25. West Virginia ﬁnally got back on the
scoreboard with two converted foul shots from guard
Johannes Herber with 44 seconds -left in the half. Page
closed the half by hitting a jumper to make the score

38-30. . ,

“[Page] is a big-time player,” Krauser said.
“[Page] is one of the best shooting guards in the
nation [and] is a great senior leader. He found his
shot, then, the next play coming-down, he found me,
and I hit ‘a shot. Then we just started rolling after
that.”' V

Pitt’s outside shooting appeared to open up its
inside game. Forward Chevon Troutman converted
several baskets in the paint. Troutman and Page led
the Panthers, with 15 points each, while Krauser had
13 points. i S

“[Pitt] made some tough shots, and we missed
shots,” West.Virginia head coach John Beilein ‘said.
“What makes Pitt so good is that that they pass the
ball [and] they are very selective with [their shots],
but they take the right shots.”

  

5. Jaron Brown puts up a jump.shot during Pitt’s win
on Saturday. The Panthers Won, 67-58.
