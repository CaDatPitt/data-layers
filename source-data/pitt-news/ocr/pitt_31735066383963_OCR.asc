For want of two players, the
season was almost lost.

Pitt head coach Jackie Sherrill,’
faced with t-he possibility of
managing a team with no offense,
found two more-than-eager
second-stringers in halfback Fred
Jacobs and quarterback Rick
Trocano, both of whom led the
Panthers to an important 28-6
crushing of William and Mary.

. Trocano, 0 starting in his first
college contest ever, hit ﬁve-of-10

passes for 103 yards, not to mention _

running for 81 yards.

“I felt good inside being able to
help the team,” Trocano said. “I
learned I was starting 15 minutes
before the game but I wasn’t
uptight at all.”

If anyone was uptight, it was the
Pitt fans who anxiously wanted to
forget last week’s fumble circus
against Notre Dame. After a 21-0
Panther ﬁrst-half lead, everyone in
Pitt Stadium felt assured.

Complimenting Trocano and
vetem halfback Elliot AWalker, who
scored three touchdowns on brilliant

iom & Mo ry, 23-6

runs, was Jacobs, getting his first —

taste of a starting assignment. The
sophomore earned 98 yards‘ in 11
carries, including a touchdown run.
“Whether I start or not, that's not
important,” Jacobs claimed. “As
long as we win, I don't care.”

But Pitt did win, perhaps well
enough ‘to improve on its 16th
national ranking.

The Panthers’ only ﬁrst-quarter
tally came compliments of a Walker
30-yard gallop. The 5-11,
193-pound senior glided to the right
side of the line, broke several
tackles and crosses the goal line.

The second stanza was more
productive. Walker again scored
for Pitt, barrelling over the center
for a one-yard effort and giving the
Panthers a 14-0 advantage.

Pitt upped its advantage to three
touchdowns thanks to monsterback
Jeff Delany’s interception, which
was returned to the Indians’ 11-yard
line. Jacobs ﬁnished off a four-play
drive with one-yard burst over right
guard to help the Panthers to a 21-0
half-time bulge.

After a scoreless third quarter,
Pitt struck again very early in the

Students graduating with
engineering degrees are placed into

skills than students in other

Center survey, only 16 failed to ﬁnd
employment. Chemical, electrical,
metallurgical and materials
engineers all had a 100 percent
placement record.

Those graduates with physics
degrees also had a perfect
job-finding record, although only
four such persons were studied in
the survey.

Those with chemistry, computer
science and masters of business

  

«~~~.;f/’.:i"§I_,!,lStI'3lIl0Il (MBA) degrees had
 placement success of 70 percent or

above. Graduates with economic
degrees entering the job market
fared worst of all, with only 34
percent ﬁnding employment.

The study also provided data
showing the mean monthly salary of
graduates in selected ﬁelds. Once
again, engineers came out on top.
Engineers’ salaries ranged from a
low of $1,222 for civil engineers to a
high of $1 .500 for mining engineers.
Those with MBAs also were high on
the list, with a mean monthly salary
Those with economic

grees lucky enough to ﬁnd jobs
had to start out at a lower salary
than many of their classmates, with
a monthly stipend of $943.

Thirty-five of the graduates

The Placement Center alo
released statistics showing how
many Pitt graduates moved on to
American medical and dental
schools. In 1977, 87 Pitt students
went to medical school, a decline
from the 1976 total of 96. _Of the 87
who entered medical school in 1977,
32 remained at Pitt, also down from
the 1976 total of 50 who chose to stay
at the University.

$50,000 To Nyden Reported .

A Pittsburgh newspaper reported
last-week that Dr. Paul J. Nyden
accepted $50,000 from Pitt as
payment for dropping a federal
court suit protesting his contract’s
termination.

The Pittsburgh Press, which
claimed to have obtained a

transcript of an agreement made.

between lawyers for Nyden and the
University Aug. 30 in the chambers
of U.S. District Court Judge Daniel
Snyder, reported that the settle-
ment also contained a “gentle-
men’s agreement” concerning
non-disclosure of the financial
terms.

Both Nyden and the University
have conﬁrmed the existence of
such an agreement. A source close

to Nyden would not conﬁrm the
dollar ﬁgure but said, “If they (the
Press)‘ wrote about it, I would
assume that they know what they're
talking about.” 0

Nyden last night repeated his
statement that the settlement will
allow him to continue his coal-
industry union research “for a
considerable period of time.”

Nyden had sought a three-year
contract with Pitt’s sociology
department in his suit. His last
two-term salary offer was some
$14,000, ‘making the settlement
worth somewhat’ more than such a
contract. »

Nyden also is reported to have
asked for legal fees in negotiations

with Pitt, however, and any such

the $50,000.

Nyden last night would not
comment on the published report,
saying’ he wished to consult his
lawyer, James Logan. Later
attempts to contact the 32-year-old
sociologist were fruitless.

Nyden has accepted a teaching
post for this year at a branch
campus of Antioch College in West
Virginia. His last contract with Pitt
expired April 30, though hewas
offered an unusual 15-month

contract ovrr the summer by

Chancellor Posvar--an offer that
later was withdrawn, when Pitt
decided Nyden’s response to the
proposal did not constitute accept-
ance.

Nyden has said he accepted the
University's offer because he
believes it is unlikely he could win in
court. He cited the recent case in
which Dr. Sharon Johnson lost a
ﬁve-year legal battle with Pitt that
also enidedin her’ loss of ’a‘ job.’ “

“ 72 Years of Collegiate Journalism at the University of Pittsburgh "
SGB Review - Part I
More. than 200 days ago this newspaper welcomed, in a series of
five editorials, the newly inaugurated Student Government Board
’(SGB) The series focused on iss,l1.<1ST'1"ﬂ1€P.i“N€W3' be1i°V¢d the
board should face what performance could be expected from such
confrontation. _ _
Recent actions on the part of SGB, which were discussed in

Friday’s editorial, make it necessary to reopen the series and
examine what the SGB has accomplished thus far.

In February, the editorial series listed the issues and offered
possible solutions. SGB was set expect to follow our solutions to

the letter—-if it had a bette_rwanswer._ But for the_m0st part, it
ap.pears,to have had no answer.’

 

This paper expected more input for students, especially interest
groups such as commuters and the Black Action Society. And we
wanted this input to be more than merely getting through channels.
Unfortunately, the champion and alleged liason of the commuters,
JoAnn Levinson, resigned because she dropped out of school.
Little was accomplished during her tenure, though. The lot of the
commuters had improved little during the Payne Administration.

Since February, not one major program has been initiated to
benefit commuters, a group comprising a majority of day students.
And-their problems are many: parking, programming, reasonable
places to eat—-things the resident student takes for granted. The
summer cafe was a good idea, but few commuters benefited then
and none benefit now.

Many candidates campaigned for increased student services to
help students cope with increased costs for higher education. The

_food co-op‘ has been a success thus far, and it is hoped the success

will continue. However, that will not be known until the co-op
resumes business next week. -

Another service believed to be necessary was responsive
programming. It now seems that SGB’s idea for responsive

' programming is to run it itself. More programming comment will

appear in a future editorial. However, suffice it to say that more
responsive programming can be best accomplished by a committee
of student experts than by a benevolent board of elected
representatives, whether the produce is produced by students or a
promoter.

The Undergraduate Academic Review (UAR), a critique of Pitt
instructors, was another promised service. Student leaders have
pushed for a UAR that was credible and free from faculty
inﬂuence. Ahmie Baum, who resigned his board seat last summer,
i'v8Ht‘étt hatuést Pdt me were an the UAR. His absence has
undoubtedly cause SGB delay over its creation. He has indicated
that even though he is no longer a member, he will continue work
on the review. Taht is all well and good. However, it still is up to
SGB to have a member directly involved in the production of the
UAR.-

The issue about which this paper had strongest beliefs was that of
tuition levels. SGB’s silence was curious during pre-increase
discussions. Demonstrations didn’t work, but they had a better
chance than silence.

Then an unexpected problem arose: the legislature’s
misappropriation of Pitt’s funds for other purposes. The fight for
those funds carries as much importance as the fight against a
tuition increases. So far, the _board has done its best but faces the
same problem as the Administration——a Legislature that is “re-

. election crazy” and won’t-commitiitself to anything requiring extra
, funds and a.tax increase.

Although we advised student organizations against taking an
activist stand‘ when lobbying for funds, this is a tactic the SGB
should not rule out. Activism does not necessarily mean picketing
the state capital for days; it can take the form of aggressive
lobbying in Harrisburg, lobbying that is more than shaking heads
and shuffling from office to office.

An analysis of current lobbying, with suggestions for the weeks
to come, will be the subject of Wednesday’s editorial.

Letters to the Editor

Nyden Supporter Explains Settlement Reasoning

In response to Mr. David‘
Ashley’s' column of Sept. 12:

Thank you for your concern
about Paul Nyden’s supporters,
Mr. Ashley, but...

Were you there when we were
standing out in the cold for hours
asking support from the student
body and the faculty?

Were you there when we sent
letters and politely asked to meet
with Chancellor Posvar and were
denied wven that chance to talk to
him as students with questions and
problems?

Were you there when we
accidentally gained admittance into
the Chancellor’s elaborately fur-
nished office?

Were you there when we were
read a false trespassing injunction
and were told to leave the
premises—with a police escort?

Were you there when we were
called “illegal students” because
we were concerned about the
futures of professors Paul Nyden,
Patrick Ntukogo and Yusef Ali and
about the quality of education that
we, as students, are receiving?

Were you there at Paul Nyden’s
hearing, when it became apparent
to everyone in the courtroom that
Pitt’s lawyers had no case—that
they were simply denying academic
freedom and freedom of speech to
professor Nyden because he was a
Marxist in an ultra-conservative
sociology depaxtment?

Were you there to hear the
testimony that we,‘ as students,
have no voice in who our professors
will be?

If you were there, Mr. Ashley,
we didn’t see you.

Who really won in Paul Nyden’s
case? Don’t you see, Mr. Ashley,
that victory has been won? It is the
victory of bringing into the light
issues of concern to the students
and taxpayers of this community-
issues that have been hidden from
us even though it is our tuition
money and our tax dollars that
support the University of
Pittsburgh. Isn't it the Adminis-
tration’s “moral obligation" to
receive our input on how they
spend our money? And is it not a
fact the Nyden case illustrates how
the Administration denies us this
input?

The issues brought out during
the Nyden struggle are many.
Take the fact that, shocking as it
may be, Chancellor Posvar vetoed
both the Faculty Senate Committee
and the Faculty Hearing Board
when they ruled in professor
Nyden’s favor. The point is

~,. Li I

face.

obvious. The Chancellor has no
qualms about ignoring the wishes
of his faculty when, in a case like
Paul Nyden’s, their collective
decision -goes against what he
wants to do. Is this really in
keeping with the democratic
-principles of a university? And
bear in mind, Mr. Ashley, that this
University is where we are being
educated about the principles of
democracy, independent thinking,
and tolerance for other points of
view. Does the irony strike you,
Mr. Ashley, or do you bother to
concern yourself with such trivia?

The crucial issue behind the
Nyden struggle has always been
that professor Nyden, far from
being an isolated “individual,” is
only one example of a chilling
pattern at, the University of
Pittsbrugh. The pattern extends
beyond the ranks of the faculty to
include staff and students at Pitt as
well——it is a documented pattern of
discrimination ‘on the grounds of
race, sex, political ideology and
union activity. Paul Nyden is not
the ﬁrst person to be fired from the
University of Pittsburgh for being
outspoken about his political
beliefs-although we hope that
through our efforts he wil be one of
the last. The fact that the
University's lawyers offered Paul
Nyden a cash settlement should be
evidence enough to convince
anyone who followed the Nyden
case that the University and not
professor Nyden was at fault. You
do not offer money to someone who
is suing you if you are in the right.
You simply win in court.

Another well-known example of

‘ Pitt’s discriminatory policies is the

Sharon Johnson case. When Judge
Knox ruled against professor
Johnson, after a hellishly long and
expensive court battle, it was a
decision that saddened many
women (and men), both on and off
campus. But it was a decision that
we, ‘as. women, were in a sense
prepared for—-—,. livin_g as we do in a
sexist society. What you con-
veniently neglected to mention in
your letter, Mr. Ashley, is that,
even though Judge Knox ruled
against Sharon Johnson, he did

admit that the evidence showed a '
.clear-cut policy of sex» discrimina-

tion on the part of the University.
But then, it’s obvious that you
know all about sexism, don’t you,
Mr. Ashley?

Did you know, Mr. Ashley, that
you have no say at this University?
We know because we've
struggled—only~ to have the doors
of the Chancellor’s elaborately
furnished ofﬁce slammed in our

. !
I'’‘vD A0,.‘

Have you really looked on both
sides of the issue, Mr. Ashley? If
you had, you would understand

that Paul Nyden’s case is a victorytf?-"

It’s opened a whole can of worms,
Mr. Ashley. And Paul Nyden’s
case is only the beginning.

So in the future, Mr. Ashley,
don’t be concerned about us-the
students who support Paul
Nyden——because you see, we are
concerned about you. That is our
struggle.

Let this be known, that as Paul
Nyden’s supporters, we have no
intention of “taking the money and
running.” Weiwill continue to
ﬁght for our right to be taught by
progressive professors——Paul
Nyden, Patrick Ntukogo and Y V
Ali-—-and against the present
Administration. We are calling for

,Chancellor Posvar’s resignation.

We are demanding more student
imput into policy-making at the
University of Pittsburgh. We invite
all students who are concerned
with receiveing a- quality, _ unbiased
education and say in determining it
to join in our struggle. M

Right now, Professor Patrick
Ntukogo of the black studies
department has been refused
tenure by Dean Rosenberg.
Professor Ntukogo has been a
supporter of Professors Paul Nyden
and. Yusef Ali during their

struggles on campus and 

activist both on the Pitt campus and
in the community. Curtis Porter,
chairman of the black studies
department, had written a letter in

' favor of giving professor Ntukogo

tenure. This letter has been totally
disregarded in Rosenberg’s
arbitrary decision to get rid of
Patrick Ntukogo.

Mr. Ntukogo’s ﬁring is the most
recent in a series of similiar actions
taken by Dean Rosenberg and

Chancellor Posvar to underrﬁvﬁ

the autonomy of the black studies
department at Pitt. We demand
this autonomy for the black studies
department and the immediate
reinstatement of professor
Ntukogo. We cannot afford to have
Patrick Ntukogo leave the black
studies department-—he has too
much to contribute to the education
of both black and white students at
Pitt. V

 South Africa: The Confrontation Approaches  

(1:

By GARY GOVERT
and NEIL POWERS

The vast majority of Ameri-
cans had never heard of him, but
when Steven Biko died in South
Africa last week, it was more than
just another obituary. It was
another episode in a series of
events that threaten to tie United
States foreign policy tighter and
tighter. in the years to come.

Biko, described as “probably the
most inﬂuential young black leader
in South Africa” and “one of the
main hopes for a peaceful solution
to the racial crisis” in that country,
died from as yet undisclosed causes
24 hours after he had been
admitted to a Pretoria hospital.
According to “The New York
Times,” the 30-year-old co-founder
from a Port Elizabeth prison, where
he ‘was under ‘detention for
allegedly “fomenting unrest” and
“urging violence and arson by
blacks seeking to overthrow apar-
theid.” Under South Africa’s
Terrorism Act, Biko could have
been imprisoned without .trial for
an indeﬁnite period.

In Biko’s death—-and in the
minority government’s fear of
violent reprisals-——there is a clear
message to the United States: the
fuse is running out in South Africa.
Unless this country makes some
significant foreign policy adjust-
ments, the United States could find
itself very near ground zero when
the explosion comes.

Of course, the ruling white
Nationalist Party will not be blown
into soon-forgotten fragments any-
time during the next few days. All
things considered, the present
government "is probably the most
powerful in Africa. . -

With" the best air force on the
continent, over 1,000 armored

about $1 billion, South Africa is not
likely to be caught with its defenses

number under 50,000, and a militia _
of 72,000 could be mobilized in two V

days. The army has been trained in

guerrilla tactics since 1969. And 

unless the reconnaissance photos
lie, South Africa now has nuclear
weapons capability.

Economically, the minority gov-
ernment appears to be even more
secure. Anticipating increased
world pressure, South Africa has

» ' de tremendous strides toward

‘ attaining self-sufficiency in many
essential commodities—something
neighboring countries are nowhere
near. Indigenous farms and mines
produce all the food, coal and
‘minerals required, and imports of
manufactured goods and energy
are relatively small. The balance of
trade ‘on the African continent
usually has leaned heavily in
South Africa’s favor.

Despite an impressive show of
military and economic muscle,
however, South Africa is far from a

Vulnerability to
guerrilla attack across the borders
is perhaps the biggest problem for
the Vorster regime. Tactical
training notwithstanding, guerrilla
warfare requires enormgus expen-
ditures on the part of the defending
country. Since 1966, government
troops have been battling the South
West Africa Peoples Organization
(SWAPO) in neighboring Namibia,
with up to 50,000 men engaged at
one time. Angola and Mozqm-
bique provide natural sancturaries
for guerrilla fighters. Should
__Rhodesia fall, South Africa's

“A security problems would be multi-

. plied considerably.

Until unemployment began to
rise recently, the government has

had less to fear from dissident
factions within the country itself.
South Africa’s relatively secure
internal situation is a paradoxical
one. Both the lack of organized
dissent and the reason for dissent
in the first place stem from the
same social factor: apartheid.

On the one hand, apartheid is a
gall to South Africa’s 17 million
blacks, the constant affront that
keeps anti-white sentiment sim-
mering. “It not only keeps the
races apart,” an African Roman
Catholic bishop said recently, “it
shouts from the rooftops the
superiority of the white race and
the inferiority of the black race.”
Under the circumstances, the urge
to lash back, ‘particularly evident
among the young, can hardly be
surprising. Recent riots in the
powder keg black townships have
underscored the importance of
economic and political injustice as
factors in South African black rage,
but these also are conditions
ultimately rooted in racism.

The otherside of the coin is the
government’s success in using
apartheid as a tool to prevent black
unity. As in much of Africa, a
unified black nationalism has been
slow to catch on in a culture

historically divided along tribal A

lines. Using the situation to its
best advantage, the government
has not only insisted upon rigid
black/white segregation, but has

stressed African ethnic separate- ‘

ness as well. The result has been a
carefully nurtured tribal disunity.

The cornerstone of divide-and-
conquer apartheid in South Africa
is the government’s homelands
policy. Under the Lands and Trust
Act of 1936, about 13 percent of the
country was set aside for native

reserves, with a specific homeland
intended for each of the major
tribes. After the Nationalist Party
came to power in 1948, this system
of white dominance became
entrenched. The creation of
“independent” Transkei was a
recent step towards full implemen-
tation of the homelands policy, and
it raised a storm of protest
worldwide.

Besides constituting a setback to
hopes for black unity in South
Africa, the success of the
homelands policy would present
the white minority with a number
of otheradvantages. One of these
might be the ability to set up
manufacturing and industrial
facilities in the domestic colonies,
where the unskilled and semi-
skilled labor force could be

‘ efﬁciently exploited. Copper could.
be smelted and steel rolled without
any environmental discomfort to
the white. population, and there
would be little reason to change the
present structure of ownership and
control.

The context in which the United
States must formulate its now and
future policy towards the Republic

of South Africa is greatly com-

plicated by the sheer weight of
American interests in that part of
the world. U.S. economic
investments in South Africa total
well over one billion dollars.

General Motors, Ford,
Burroughs and several other

 

IBM, i

multinationals have operations
there. Mobil Oil Corporation is a
major supplier of fuel to the South
African military. Citibank of New
York has loaned some $300 million
to the minority government.
Again, South Africa’s wealth of
natural resources plays an impor-
tant role. If the United States’
image among black Africans does
not improve, an eventual collapse
of the South African government
could result in a breaking of trade

rich/ poor polarity is at the neart of
poor relations between those
countries and the United States,
and an analogous situation
between whites and blacks in South
Africa is no more acceptable.

Neither are nebulous declarations
of racial equality and crash
programs for increased production
the keys to a healthy economic
order in South Africa. Reforms in
the areas of production and
distribution controls are vital if any

relations between this country and
the new regime. United States
imports of- at least two important
commodities, chromite and
manganese, would then depend
heavily on one country: the Soviet
Union. ‘

In the political sphere, the major
United States concern is
probability of any new government
coming under heavy Communist
inﬂuence. Soviet and Chinese
‘interests play a significant role in
the internal politics of many
surrounding countries, and
decidedly Marxist leanings are
evident among some of the
emerging black nationalist groups
in South Africa. Should the present
government fall, relations between
the U.S. and South Africa would
almost certainly suffer from acute
ideological strain.

So what is the correct American
response to the South African
political potboiler? In 10,000 words
or less, the problems can’t even be

covered completely—let alone the _

answers—but here are a few initial
suggestions:

A greater level of expertise in
African culture should be
integrated into the State Depart-
ment.
past and present ideologies and
systems, is needed if any progress
is to be made toward a better sense
of justice for South Africa.

The United States must take a
strong and vocal stand against
apartheid and especially against
the South African government’s
homelands policy. One need not be
a visionary to see that South
Africa’s future depends on the
unity of all her peoples and not
upon some Machiavellian program
of domestic colonization. Con-

~ tinued ethnic separatism under the

homelands policy can only exacer-
bate an already difﬁcult situation.

A genuine commitment to
economic justice in South Africa,
backed up by action, must be a key
ingredient in United States foreign
policy. This should be an
automatic outgrowthiof ‘a strong
stand against apartheid; but it also
must be dealt with spiecifically. In
the eyes of the third world, the

the *

New blood, not married to ,

higher level of economic justice is
to be achieved. Blacks must have
access to participationin all areas
of the South African economy. And
at the same time, it might be a
good idea to take a long, hard look

at some aspects of the currently

reigning economic philosophy: for
instance, the desirability of con-
tinuous economic growth in the
face of human and“*~environmental
limits.

The ﬁxation on the Red Scare
should be abandoned and replaced
with a concern for the things that
make Marxism attractive in the
first place. Black South Africans
are probably not unaware of the
totalitarian and repressive
character displayed by Marxist

regimes in general—-but neither do
they miss the fact that while the
Marxist countries offer help in the
struggle against white oppression,
the democratic West seems to be
more concerned with lamenting
governmental inefficiency among
the emerging African nations. If it
is Communism we fear, then we
ought not devote too much time to
worrying about wild-eyed Leninist

. bogeymen streaming out of the

jungle. We ought to see what we
can do about a political, economic,
and social system that institution-
ally discriminates against 80
percent of South Africa’s people.

Overall, the United States’ South
African policy should be geared
less toward stabilization and more
toward reform. There is too much
of the status quo inherent in the
idea of stabilization, too much
danger of ineffectual cosmetic
change. It would be absurd and
immoral to advocate violence as the

means to peace and justice in South — _
Africa, but it would be an oversight ,

if we failed to see that the present
revolution, white South Africans
will have to take deliberate action
to promote reacial equality on all
levels which is far from likely under
any circumstances and a virtual
impossibility unless there is un-
relenting pressure from the United
States and other Western
countries.

Lest anyone doubt theurgency. of
the situation, there were 1,500
mourners at an illegal memorial
service for Steven Biko last
Thursday, 1,200 of who the police
felt compelled to arrest. Despite.
the government’s best efforts.
black nationalism is on the rise in
South Africa. And Ian Smith’s

Rhodesia is getting closer to the "

brink. If the United States and
other Western countries quickly
take a strong, active stand against
racism in southern Africa, it may
still be possible for black leaders to
find an alternative to revolutionary
violence. Otherwise, the blood will
flow,’ black and white, from
Capetown to Angola, and the
future of justice for 25 million
people will be in the hands of
battle-worn and cynical guerrillas.

was optimistic—-optimistic that it
would be too windy, or too cloudy,
or, even better, that it would rain
soon. . .because deep down, she was
envious. I had told her that one day
I’d get her her heart’s desire—a
ride in a balloon. But she still
hadn’t done it, and today I was
getting a ride in that beautiful ship,
‘I the blimp America.

I arrived at Allegheny County
Airport at the appointed time of 2
P.M., camera, ﬁlm and palpitating
heart all ready to see Pittsburgh as
it should be seen: leisurely, at
about 25 to 35 and 1,000 feet

 ﬁhead. -
0 1’ ary Brown, public relations man

for the Goodyear Tire and Rubber
Company of Akron, Ohio, saw that
those scheduled for this ﬂight
received the information necessary
to make their experience most
memorable. Audrey Quel, Jim
Berry, Tom Skubel, Bob Tucker,
Jim Scott and myself were the
passengers; Captain Don McDuff
was at the controls.

As the America blew back and
forth along the grassy section of the-
~ way, still secured to the mast,

 six of us climbed up the moving

ladder and sat down in the plush
seats. There was much conversa-
tion, but nobody really listened to
anybody else; the talk represented a
way of easing the tensions each of
us felt about our ﬁrst trip in the
lighter-than-air craft.

When seated aboard a conven-
tional airplane, one expects to hear
the hostess announce, ‘buckle your
seat belts,’ but or board the blimp
America, such was not the case. In
fact, I don't remember seeing any
belts at all, although they probably

were there.

After we were seated, McDuff
turned and asked if everyone had
made the necessary stops prior to

on board and he couldn't stop at the

nearest service station should
someone _feel the -need. We all
answered in the affirmative.

McDuff then informed the control
tower he was ready for liftoff. The
directions to proceed arrived and
the motors came to life. The ground
crew (held the mooring lines until
the ship cleared the pylon. pylon-

The noise of the motors reminded
me of the noise produced by -the
Ford Tri-motor Itraveled in with my
grandfather from Bay ' City
Michigan to Detroit when I was 10

years old. I couldn't hear any of the

other passengers talking until after
the America reached cruising
elevation and the motors slowed to
about 35 m.p.h.

During the takeoff, I snapped
pictures as if they were going out of
style. I finished one roll and was
taking out the film for the next roll
when I discovered I had failed to
remove the lens cover. Oh well! I
did the same thing at my son’s
wedding. I said I wasn’t nervous
then, too.

All the other passengers were
busy looking and snapping their
cameras. The view was great,
everyone agreed this would be the
way to see the country if they could
arrange such a trip. There was
evident envy of the crew and pilot.

Imagine traveling around the
eastern half of the country‘ from
May through October at the
leisurely pace of the America, just
enjoying this great country.

We ﬂew over the South Side and
up toward the Point, hovering over
the downtown section for a few
minutes. The cameras took as many

pictures as ﬁlm allowed.

I have seen many pictures of the
Point, but none equaled the sight
from the America. I wished that all
my friends could have experienced
the view which I will always carry
with me.

Jim Oliver, the America’s motor
mechanic, told me the amount of
people needed to service the
America was 21-16 ground crew
and ﬁve pilots. But because of _7,560
“Super. Skytacular” lights,
weighing 1,200 pounds, the blimp’s
had to be made smaller. The

FEATURES\

Without the lights, the America
could carry, on a very economical
trip, approximately 12 people. With
passengers and freight, the blimp’s
lift capacity increases to 3,281
pounds, not great but significant
never-the-less.

When the wind is calm, the twin
Continental, 6-cylinder, engines are
able to push the America at a
maximum speed of 50 m.p.h. With
a range of 500 miles, transcontinen-
tal trips must be planned carefully.

‘The blimp just can’t set down

anyplace, because when it arrives at
its destination it must be met with
the ground crew and the pylon (or
else you’d have a‘ little difficulty).

As I watched McDuff handle the
controls he clearly demonstrated
that being the captain of a blimp

was not a job for a lazy person. He ‘

was constantly working the rudder
pedals and the -elevator wheel,
mounted at his right. The control
panel is much less complicated than
an airplane’s, but the need to
manipulate the controls kept the
captain’s left hand busy. McDuff

kept in constant touch with the

America’s ground station via his
mike and earphones so any dangers
or emergency could immediately be
communicated. He also informed
them of his expected landing time.
As we ﬂew over the U.S. Steel
building, McDuff expressed his
dream of doing a “Touch-n-go” on
her heloport. He restrained
himself (this time). ,

Sitting in my comfortable plush
seat, Ithought about holes. “Do
you ever get holes in the catenary
curtain? If you do, how do you
repair them?” I said. I A

“Yes! We do get holes.
Occassionally some Davy Crockett

type will take his trusty squirrel gun
and pot shot at the curtain, or some
element factor will cause damage.
When this happens, we get inside
the envelope and look around. The
inside is black and any hole looks
like a star in the night. The
maintainence crew patches the hole
and we are ready for the next
ﬂight,” McDuff responded.

The fact that there are really
three envelopes allays any real
danger. At each end of the catenary
curtain there are two smaller
ballonets containing helium. The
large space between these is filled
with normal-type air, obtained by a
couple of scoops behindweach of the
motors, which are opened and
closed as needed,’ he said.

Trivia buffs may be interested in
knowing who coined the term
“Blimp”. According to McDuff,
(later Air Commodore) A.D.
Cunningham of the Royal Navy Air
Service was conducting a weekly
inspection tour of the British air
station Cape] and stopped to inspect
the king's Airship SS-12. He
playfully reached up and ﬂipped his
thumb at the gasbag. An odd noise
echoed off the taut fabric.
Cunningham smiled, then imitated
the soundhis thumb had drummed
out of the ship’s bag: “Blimp!”
Those nearby saw and heard this
unusual inspection interlude, and
its account quickly spread.

I found out ballooning and
Blimpin g has been around for a long
time. A young Frenchman named
De Rozier made the ﬁrst recorded
ascent in a balloon in 1783. His
ﬂight was witnessed enthusias-
tically by Benjamin Franklin, then
United States ambassador to
France. I

4 David Schwartz.

The ﬁrst balloon ﬂight in America
was performed in 1793 in Phila-
delphia by Jean Pierre Blanchard,
another Frenchman, who in 1785
made the first ﬂight over the
English Channel from Dover to
Calais. George Washington
sanctioned his American venture.
The ﬂight lasted about 45 minutes
and took Blanchard to New Jersey.

With the development of the

gas-tight bag, the gas valve and’

other devices, ballooning came into
its own in the 19th century.
Balloons found great favor as aerial
observation posts in the American
Civil War and the Franco-Prussian
War.

The ﬁrst power-driven balloon, a
145-foot dirigible, was built in 1852
by -French inventor Henri Giffard.
Power was supplied by a three-
horsepower steam engine.

The ﬁrst rigid airship, with an
interior framework to maintain its
shape, was built in 1898 by Austrian
Powered by a
12-horsepower engine with a belt
drive, the airship crashed on its
maiden ﬂight.

_ It remained for Count Ferdinand
von Zeppelin, a. retired German
cavalry general, to develop the ﬁrst

practical rigid airship in 1900. His \

work, until his death in 1917,
established Germany as a lighter-
than-air power. The industry which
he founded produced 115 rigid
airships between 1900 and 1918.
Many were military ships, which
terrorized the British Isles with
bombing raids during World War I.

Non-rigid airships also came into
their own during World War I,
along with the familiar, sausage-
shaped observation and barrage

balloons. America’s ﬁrst military
airship, a non-rigid type, had been
built in 1908 by Army Signal Corps
Major Thomas S. Baldwin.
Goodyear built its ﬁrst airship
envelope in 1911, a big, 400,000-
cubic-foot bag ordered by a
lighter-than-air enthusiast named
Melvin Vaniman. He planned to ﬂy
across the Atlantic Ocean. His
attempt proved, disastrous. A spark
from an engine set ﬁre to the
hydrogen-filled bag, plunging the
airship into the ocean just off the
New Jersey coast. Vaniman and
several crewmen were lost.
' Goodyear established its reputa-
tion as a leader in lighter-than-air

during World War I, producing
more than 1,000 balloons and
approximately 100 non-rigid
airships for the Allies.

The company had been ready to
aid the war effort, thanks to the
foresightedness of P.W. Litchﬁeld,
a production wizard who later
became chairman of the board of
Goodyear. He had witnessed a
balloon race and other lighter-than-
air craft in action in France in 1910,
and had determined that Goodyear
should become a part of the
then-infant aviation industry.

The most popular period for
airships were the years between
World War I and World War II when
Germany, France, Great Britain

and the United States all had rigid
airships. Goodyear’s ﬂeet of
commercial blimps, as many as six
operating at one time, also was born
during this period.

Goodyear pioneered the use of
helium in 1925 when the first of its
commercial airships, the Pilgrim,
was inﬂated with the nonﬂammable
gas. Until that time, hydrogen was
the most frequently used lifting
agent, but it is highly ﬂammable. A
cubic foot of hydrogen can lift about
10 percent more weight than a cubic
foot of helium, but the latter has a
greater safety advantage.

Popularity of airships hit its peak
in the 1930’s. The global passenger

  Think twice.

Germany’s Graf Zeppelin and
Hindenburg, and the nationwide
ﬂights of the Navy’s Goodyear-built
Akron and Macon captured the
imaginations of people the world
over.

It was Goodyear’s contract to
build the Akron and Macon that
resulted in the famed Zeppelin

Airdock at Akron‘, Ohio. A building‘

had to be constructed in which the
Navy’s giant rigid airships could be
assembled. Completed in 1929, the
structure is the largest in the world
without interior support. It’s 1,300
feet long, 300 feet wide and 200 feet
high.

The Airdock has been called one
of the “seven wonders of the
modern world.” It continued to
serve as an airship production
facility until 1960, when it was
converted to other manufacturing
use. (Envelopes for the America,
Mayﬂower and Columbia were
made at Goodyear Aerospace
Corporation's facility in Litchﬁeld
Park, Arizona, while the complete
airships were assembled at
Goodyear’s hangar at Wingfoot
lake, Ohio.)

Popularity of the rigid airships
ended in the late 1930’s with the
loss of the Akron, Macon and
Hindenburg within a period of 37
months. However, these tragedies
were responsible in part for the
accelerated development of the
non-rigid airships, particularly for
the Navy’.

Despite this, the Navy had only 10
non-rigid airships in operation
when Pearl Harbor was attacked on

AerialSightseers Good Time”

December 7, 1941. By the end of the
war, the Navy had 168 airships in
operation. Most of them were
constructed by Goodyear. In fact,
blimps of Goodyear’s commercial
ﬂeet also were “drafted” into the
Navy to serve chieﬂy as training
craft.

The Navy airships compiled an
astonishing record during the war,
especially in the role of aerial
escorts for convoys. During the
war, in the Atlantic and Gulf waters
of the United States, and in the
coastal waters of the Caribbean,
Eastern Central America and
Brazil, 532 vessels in all were sunk.
But not one vessel was sunk by an
enemy submarine while under
escort by an airship. Altogether,
Navy airships escorted 89,000 ships
during the war without loss of a
single vessel.

Goodyear resumed its
commercial airship operation after
World War II. With the advent of
the Korean conﬂict, the Navy one
again, stepped up its airship
operations. ‘

The last airships built by

Goodyear for the Navy were four
huge ZPG-3W type non-rigid

airships for use in the nation’s' '

early-waming defense network.
These airships were retired from
service by the Navy after more
sophisticated early-warning
equipment was developed. Each of
the ZPG-3W’s was 10 times as large
as the Mayﬂower.

After my 45 minutes in another
world, Ireturned to earth. I'll never
be the same. I really wish you could
have been with me.

There ‘s no excuse for shying away from Rod Rodgers’ new dance, “Visions of a

Rodgers, a Detroit native with a New York based dance company, worked hard

to keep everything explicit and clear.

THE POINT of “Visions”; moments in black American history and how blacks

maintained strength and resilience in spite of discrimination.

The dance vignettes, which are played against a background of Delta blues,

ragtime contemporary jazz and classical music, tell of days in slavery, the black
migration to the North and the civil rights movement.

One of the most amusing pieces illustrates the move from the Southern plan-

tations to the Northern cities. Some of the source material is straight fromhistory .

Martin:Not AnOrdinaryGuy SV“‘Ph°“V M“Si°

By DAN ROSENTHAL

John Sebastian, formerly with the
Lovin’ Spoonful, wondered what it
would be like to be on the road for
three months with comedian Steve
Martin. Martin has a reputation of
being different than any other
comedian, despite his claims of
being “just an ordinary guy.”

Playing to two sellout audiences
last night at Heinz Hall, Martin
described himself as ‘one, “Who

Dancers Dazzle Audience

By BUENA SMITH

The Eleo Pomare Dance
Company thrilled the audience at the
Stephen Foster Memorial Theater
Friday night with its performance of
classical, modern and jazz pieces.

The excellence of the multiracial
dance troupe is beyond praise. In
seven pieces, the 12 dancers
provided the audience with a
scintillating experience.

, {I.‘h_e first dance was “Climb”

"'57), a solo piece featuring Strody
Meekins, using jerky
movements and tight isolations,
attempted to venture out of the
womb to create a life of his own. As
the dancer tried to reach out,
however, he regressed into an

- introverted ball.

But when the ﬂutist played legato,
Meekins reached the center of the
stage and started to unwind and
discover his limbs. At the end,
outstretched on his back, he assured

the audience of his achievement.

 ‘-  A ‘~* 1.‘ Serendipity (1966) was a six-part

classical piece performed to Han-
del’s Messiah by the entire
company. The dance was one of
praise; the dancers discovered their
own paths and joined in the group
prayer.

Robin Becker was extradinary as
Lady Macbeth in “The Queen's
Chamber” (1976), portraying Lady
Macbeth as a power-hungry and
sexually frustrated antagonist to her
husband (Larry,Schiffer).

Becker created a powerful dance

 _ Vjgto strengthen her character for the

‘ task of murder ahead.

Macbeth reappeared and a
struggle ensued. Finally, Becker)

“Excerpt from Hushed Voices”
(1974) featured the superb Charles
Grant. In “A Lament For
Visionaries”—Martini Luther King
and the Kenne_dys——Grant used 8
ladder in a symbolic Platonic
fashion, working with it as if it was
an extension of himself.

The portrayal of King’s slaying
and its aftermath was exceptional.
Four different “types” moumfully
walked on stage from four
directions. The ladder preceded
King’s outstretched body as the
dancers slowly left the scene.

Eleo Pomare ﬁnally appeared in
the solo piece, “Narcissus Rising”
(1968). Capturing the psyche of the
modern motorcyclist the piece
started with police calls, sirens and

dollars to see the show. He told them
they'd be getting their money’s
worth. '

‘ ‘Eight dollars isn't bad in this day
and age of inﬂation. You probably
say, ‘Eight dollars? I guess I’ll just
throw this money into the streets.
What? I can come in and see the
show for eight dollars? Oh well...’ ”

“Sometimes,” Martin said, “I
give you eight and a half dollars
worth of show so you might be able
to make out on this one.’.’

Steve Martin has played Las
Vegas and nightclubs across the
country after breaking into show
business, entertaining at fund-
raisers and filling in when
Disneyland comic or balloon man
called off sick. He’s worked his
banjo playing skill and balloon
animal-making talent into his act
and it ﬁts into the craziness nicely.

Sebastion warmed up the crowd
with a nice blend of the “old and
new.” He opened with “Mobile

highway sounds and moved into a
blues song.

With the blues, Pomare pre-
sented a sexually frustrated man
whose bike served as a substitute
for human companionship. Dressed
in black boots, chains and bikini
pants over a ﬂesh-colored leotard,
Pomare used “cool,” swaying
motions to heighten the sensual
effect. The piece revealed
Pomare’s depth and perception.

At the end of the company's
pieces, as the audience applauded,
the dancers changed their poses.
When the curtain rose again, they
gave another slant to the same
theme. The effect was magnificent;
the audience roared louder. I

Friday night’s Pittsburgh Sym-
phony concert was an odd mixture
of 18th and 20th century music.
The program, conducted by Donald
Johanos, included Barber’s over-
ture to “The School for Scandal,”
Mozart's Concerto 9 in E ﬂat, and
Bartok’s Concerto for Orchestra.

Samuel Barber’s “School for
Scandal” is a setting of Sheridan’s
“Comedy of Errors” and pokes

brass playing and lackluster strings

The highlight for most of the
audience was the long-awaited
appearance of the 80-year-old
Hungarian pianist Lili Krauss in
Mozart’s Ninth Piano Concerto.
Krauss put on quite an exhibition,
both in stage presence and piano
playing.

Krauss’s buoyance was positive-
ly effusive. She skipped and
galloped on and offstage like a
schoolgirl, trailing her ﬂoor-length,
silk gown behind her. “Withthat
costume, she looks perfect for a
production of ‘School of Scandal, ’ ”
one observer said. -

As for her performance, Krauss
played the first two movements of

Southside Turns Into A ‘J uke’box

ByKEITH BRIAN

A singer from J ersey’s South Side
appeared at Pittsburgh's South
Side this weekend. Rocking the
plaster from the ceiling, Southside
Johnny and the Asbury Jukes
pounded their sounds from the
stage of Homestead’s Leona
Theater.

The 11-man band, enameled in
three-piece suits, overpowered the
standing throngs from the very start
with “This Time It's For Real.”
The Jukes’ ﬁve-man horn section
looked and acted as if they were out
of the big band swingera. They
swung right into the next number,
“Trying To Get You Off Of My
Mind.”

manipulation of the microphone

the crowd.

The horn section (bass sax,
trombone, two trumpets and alto

dance steps and kicks similar to the
Temptations as they played “Love
On The Wrong Side Of Town,”
which featured the alto sax player.

With Southside singing and the
lead. guitarist wanging, they struck
poses and bounced all over the
stage to the incessant rhythmic
applause during “Without Love.”

By the end of this tune, the

their seats, with no less ening of
enthusiasm. Johnny picked up a

Symphony Music Varied

/Continued from Page 11}

Sudden rhythmic changes and

uneven, uncontrolled dynamics,

made the ﬁrst two movements
sound like Hungarian gypsy songs
instead of Mozart; the performance
was disconcerting.

‘In the third movement, by
contrast, Krauss played delicately
and with no rhythmic nuance.
However, left-hand octaves and
trills were cleanly played through-
out her performance. Krauss
received four - curtain calls and
many "bravos,” but no standing
ovation.

At the first solemn bass notes of
Bartok's Concerto for Orchestra,
the atmosphere instantly changed
from frivolous to somber. This
uncompromisingly bitter work is

the product of a lonely, pennilessr

Hungarian emigre, dying from
acute leukemia in a New York
hospital during World War II. .

When Bartok was dangerously
near death, he was visited by Serge

Koussevitzky, then conductor of‘

the Boston Symphony. Koussevitz-
ky was armed with a thousand
dollar commission and a request for
a new work. Bartok miraculously

man, lying across his piano, smiled
and waved each ﬁnger seperately to
the amazed audience. “Mr.

manner to Johnny's left side and the
two of them sang, ‘‘It Ain’t The
Meat, It’s The Motion.” adding
appropriate (and a few inapprop-

_ riate) gyrations.

The prancing Jukes were party-
ing away, pushing powerful poetry
out of every pore, pulling the crowd
to its feet again for “The Fever.”

After they disappeared, the ﬁve

The energy expended over the
hour-and-a-half show and absorbed

Instead, he used the
Concerto for Orchestra as a vehicle
for sneering at other composers
whose fortunes were better than
his.

For example, Bartok reputedly
said he was so tired of hearing
radio broadcasts of Shostakovich’s
“Leningrad” Symphony that he
parodied the war march and slow
movement of that work in his
concerto.

Johanos and the Pittsburgh
Symphony accentuated these paro-
dies and gave a disorderly,
emotionally volatile performance
that bordered on the schizophrenic.
The orchestra was in the midst of
“civil war.”

Ethan Stang (piccolo) and
Leonard Sharrow (bassoon)
screamed their solos at full volume,
the way they normally do under
Andre Previn. Johanos, ﬂailing his
arms in frustration, began to
change tempos and dynamic
markings so suddenly that solo
instrumentalists fought among
themselves to see who could play
loudest. Stang and Sharrow “won”
that contest, but the orchestra lost.
Johanos received only one icily
polite curtain call.

Santana
Festival
Columbia

By PHILIP SCALAMOGNA

Santana does not seem to have
the wide acclaim they enjoyed a few
years ago. Some of the group’s
members have changed and some
feel the quality of their music isn’t
as good for that reason.

The group hasn’t had a
commercial hit in ages. That
doesn’t always mean anything, but
it does appear their popularity has
faded. However, in their new
album, “Festival,” the group
displays the good, vibrant Latin-
American sound that has become a
Santana trademark.

“Camaval,” “Jugando,” and
“Maria Caracoles” display this
characteristic sound in the lively,
fast-paced congas by Chepito Areas
and Raul Rekow, the impact of the
percussion, the crisp guitar of C.D.
Santana and the spirited Spanish
vocals.

‘ ‘Revelations, ’ ’ “The River, ’ ’
and “Give Me Love” have a blues
sound. C.D. Santana’s guitar work
on “Revelations” is excellent.
Long, sweet and drawn-out, it
blends nicely, picking up tempo as

the song goes on.

Recording

Both “The River” and “Give Me

santaa Ra..;..wn.i

  .

I.ove" are easy, rhythm and blues '

ballads. Both feature rich, resonant
vocals by Leon Patillo. Al Bent’s
brass arrangements in “Give Me
Love” are ﬁne: subdued when the
mood of the song is slow, alive when
the tempo increases.

Also_ worth mentioning are “Let
the Children Play,” which has 3
nice beat and good electric guitar
work, and “Reach Up,” which has 8
slightly funky sound and beat
provided by strong percussion and
the lively bass of Pablo Tellez. In
general, Santana shows a surpris-
ing amount of versatility in its
music, experimenting with a variety
of styles.

The remaining selections, “Ver-
ao Vermelho,” “Let the Music Set
You Free” and “Try a Little
Harder” are poorer in quality. The
lyrics become repetitious, and the
linstrumentals are not put together
‘as well. -

Overall, “Festival” is a good
effort. Those who grew up on “Evil
Ways” and ‘ ‘Black Magic Woman”
should not be disappointed. They
will ﬁnd that Santana, even though
some faces have changed, still has a
lot to offer.

By JIM SPANOS

For someone who wants to be
famous or rich, being at the right
place at the right time deﬁnitely
helps. For instance, look at Rick
Trocano.

This young man could have been
one of the backup quarterbacks at
Michigan, Tennessee, West Vir-
ginia, Georgia Tech, Penn State or
Arizona. Instead, he chose to
enroll at Pitt, a team quarterbacked
bweisman Trophy candidate,
Matt Cavanaugh. Why?

“It’s weird how I ended up at
Pitt,” Trocano said. “Jimmy
Johnson (defensive coordinator)
and Matt were in Cleveland for a
banquet at which Johnny Majors
was to speak. I was going to go to
Tennessee. But Matt and Johnson
talked to me about Pitt that night.

“A short while later I asked
myself, ‘Where can I play?’
Michigan was recruiting me and
they were already talking to me
a t a redshirt. I didn’t like that.
I must have met 25 or 30 redshirts
at Michigan. I came to Pitt because

Although Pitt didn’t beat the

with the outcome.

to any great extent this year——until
Cavanaugh was injured, that is.
One local newspaper reported that
Trocano “had a hunch” Sherrill
would choose him over Tom
Yewcic, so he invited his family in
from Ohio.

Trocano’s option-running against
William and Mary was quite good.
He did manage to throw three
interceptions during the course of
the game, but that is not an
auspicious sign. Trocano passed
for 17 touchdowns during his
senior year at Brooklyn High
School in suburban Cleveland,
although he is better known for his
running ability.

“I know I can throw the ball,”
Trocano stated. “I passed for
1,700 yards last year. I was the
second-best passer in the state of
Ohio. The kid who beat me is now
a quarterback at Michigan. It’s
just a matter of getting to know the
receiver a little better.

Panther Victory More
Than Just A Win

As Saturday’s crowd filtered out of Pitt Stadium followed the
Panther’s initial win of the season, one fan was overheard telling a
companion that, except for the doubtful quarterback situation
being resolved, the reigning national champs showed their
followers very little. Nothing could be further from the truth.

Granted, the Panthers didn’t exactly run away from one of the
weaker teams on their schedule, but as Jackie Sherrill said after the
game, “A win is a win is a win.” Which is exactly what Pitt needed
to keep from becoming the first Panther team to lose two gamesin
a row since 1972.

Indeed, it was a win, and thoughmany of the players were
disappointed that they couldn’t score more points‘ in the 28-6

Time Out  
By Jim Pane  

deasion over William and Mary, Sherrill would have been content
with a one-point victory if it meant notching his first victory as
Panther skipper. It was a win, but it was much more than just a
win. it was a game that answered many questions concerning
Pitt’s gridiron future; questions that have lingered since last week
Foremost was the quarterback dilemma. After Matt
Cavanaugh’s unwilling departure last week, Panther fans held their
breath every time Tom Brzoza snapped the ball, but Rick
Trocano’s performance on Saturday enable everyone a sigh» of
relief. Not only was the freshman from Brooklyn, Ohio able to
hold on to the football, but he also proved capable of engineering a
balanced attack that, minus Panther turnovers, would have
resulted in a much higher point total.

Sherrill had to be pleased with a revitalized offense (“simplified”
for Trocano’s benefit) that netted 446 total yards—good enough
for an average of 7.3 yards per play. Trocano himself pitched in
with 103 yards in the air and 81 on the ground. The only regret is
that by the time Trocano reaches his potential, Cavanaugh will be-
ready to rejoin the team.

“We tried to play as many
players as we could,” Sherrill
noted. “It wou d‘n’t have done us
any good to b t William and Mary
50-0 and not _get a look at the
younger people. We used a lot of
freshman and running backs.”

Two such players were Trocano
and Jacobs, who weathered the
Indians’ supposedly tricky blitz
defense.

“If William and Mary were
stacking up against the run, I
didn’t notice it,” Jacobs said.
“The holes in the line were so big it
didn’t look like it.”

Just the right situation to have an
offense.

 

PANTHER NOTES: Pitt tried
running up the score at the end of
the ﬁrst half and toward the
condlusion of the contest by passing
on almost every down. But William

far, continuing the Carson Long tradition of extra point-

perfection.

The big surprise, however, has been Joe Gasporovic’s punting.
Gasparovic bettered last week's debut with a 46.3-yard average

against W&M, including a boot that travels 54 yards.

If he

continues, Pitt fans may soon be forgetting Larry Swider.

, J o] 0 Heath could be a welcome addition to the kick return squad
especially if Gordon Jones continues his fumbling ways. Heath
broke away for one 48-yard return against the Indians, showing a
flair not unlike Jones’ but an ability unlike the Jones of late to

hold on to the ball.

So it was a win. And it was a game that answered many of Jackie
Sherrill’s questions. And if the Panthers continue their renewed
brilliance (and there is no reason to believe why they shouldn’t)_and
if the defense continues its usual awesome ways, could again beta
team to be reckoned- with—a team once again in the major bowl
picture-—and a team once again in the running for the national

championship.

Now, if the Panthers could only eliminate the turnovers...

Bethany Kicks Booters

ByJIMPANE

The Pitt soccer team lost a 3-1
decision to Bethany Friday night at
Pitt Stadium to drop the hooters’
recordto 1-2. Coach Leo Bemis said
the fact that there were no soccer
lines painted on the ﬁeld had
nothing to do with the Panthers’
performance.

‘,‘The‘coaehes decided before me
game that we would play without
thelines,” Bemis said.” “It didnft
affect the team in any way.“

Rather, the’ Panther coach
attributed the squad’s demise to the
fact that Bethany’s entire team,
along with a few talented freshmen,
has returned from last year’s

President's Athletic Conference

, championship squad.

“It was an exciting game.”
Bemis admitted. “The Bethany
team played will as did our guys.’

Bethany scored ﬁrst on a penalty
kick then Pitt’s John O’Hara evened
the score with a penalty kick of his
own . After Bethany took the
lead,2-1, Bemis pushed his team up
to try to score. As a result, Bethany
put the icing on the cake with a
head-shot goal that was assisted by
a corner kick.

“It didn't matter if we lost, 2-1 or
3-1,” Bemis explained, “so we
decided to take a chance.”

The Panthers are currently

preparing for Friday’s game against

Bemis said he is going to stress
offense.

“We are going to have to polish
the ﬁnishing aspect of the game,”
Bemis said. “Too many times
against Bethany we elected to pass
the ball when we had the
opportunity to shoot.”

Friday's game will begin at 7:30

is important for the seven girls on
the team to “stay together” during
the race, Falck said, because the
team with the fewest points wins.
The ﬂlrther back a runner ﬁnishes,
the more points her team recieves
and in the end, when the team points
are added together, the slower girl's
hurt the team score.

A team like Pitt accumulates
fewer points because all the girls

have about the same amount of skill.
Thus, cross country is a team sport
as well as an individual sport.

The Pantherettes have been
doing a lot of technique work in their
two weeks of practice and soon
should meet their goal of 75 miles a
week. Needless to say, they should
be in good shape for the rest of this
season.

Duffers Par-ticularly Confident

By GARY GRAFF

Most of today’s talk on the Pitt
campus will concern Pitt’s Satur-
day football victory. No one will be
talking about some lesser known
Panthers-—the golf team—who will
play their first match today in
Youngstown.

‘‘I’m more conﬁdent this year
than ever before,” said head coach
Steve Petro, after his team braved
the Friday afternoon rain for a ﬁnal
practice at Cherry Hills Inn and
Country Club. .

Petro has reason to be confident.
Last year the golfers ﬁnished
seventh out of 20 teams in the East.
Led by senior Jim Kurey and

- ~ sophm'b're‘J'in1‘ Mc'Gi'a'th,' 'tne"s'¢ua'a"'

is looking to improve and perhaps
‘become the best golf team ever to
come out of Pitt.

“I have six, maybe eight boys
who have the potential to become
good, competitive golfers,” Petro
said.

The top six are rounded out by
sophmores Kevin McCarthy, Alan
English, Andrew Boyle and Larry
Smore. Petro is hoping that junior
Bob Elliott and sophmore John
Morrow, both of whom have
schedule problems, will eventually
be able to join the squad.

“We’ll know how good we are
when iyeigmeet at the Youngstown
tournament,” Petro predicted.

"Pi‘fif"”"w'ﬁ6'§e”“g“6lf"‘p?o'g‘r”é"ni"‘ i's“n“o"i“M

subsidized, will meet teams able to
grant scholarships and compensa-
tion to their squad members.

How much of a handicap is this?"
“Golf is an individual game,”
Petro explained, “and there are
some people with superior ability.
A player of that quality needs
compensation from his school. The
man who is looking for aid will not
come to Pitt.”

Pitt’s golf team might ﬁnally
receive the attention it deservs
beginning next year, when the
NCAA institutes a" national golf
program. The Panthers will be in
Division I of the Eastern League
with Penn State, West Virginia and
Duquesne. The top team in the
division will go on to compete in
h‘aFtiiai1'2i'iItﬁiiinériueiits.‘ ‘  ‘ I ‘ ‘

Regardless of ﬁnances, 

remains optimistic about the
coming season.

“We' should do better than
seventh.” he said after Friday’s
practice. “Even in the rain, I can
see the scores are improving.”

A true test of the squad’s ability
will come on September 23rd, when
the annual Pitt Invitational is held
at Cherry Hills. Twenty of the top
teamsiin the East will be on hand
for the year’s first mass gathering
of collegiate golf teams.

Until then, the Pitt sqifaii‘
remains an independent power in
Eastern golf. After today’s match
in Youngstown, Pitt could be
standing quite close to the top.

By The Associated Press

Penn State's Joe Patemo is not
your typical, cliche-spouting college
football coach. For one thing, he
wins more than most coaches.

So while No. 1-ranked Michigan's
Bo Schembechler was asking
newsmen to ‘ ‘do me a favor and vote
us out of ﬁrst place;"’ while
fifth-ranked Oklahoma's Barry
Switzer was warning that his
Sooners are not ready for next
week’s big game with No. 6 Ohio

State; while No. 3 Notre Dame, No. 0

4 Alabama and three other
members of the Top Twenty were
losing to unranked teams, Patemo
was saying that 10th-rated Penn
State's 31-14 whipping of No. 9
Houston “tells me that we have a
pretty good football team.”

But remember that Paterno is,
after all, a football coach and, since
coaches are never completely
satisﬁed with anything less than a
perfect season, he tempered his
remarks a bit:

 “TRUST WHAT

YOU KNOW”

“Just learning about
something isn’t really
enough. You have to trust
yourself to use the knowl-
edge. That’s having
confidence. How else could
I do something as com-
plicated as this?”

And if you haven’t used
tampons yet, knowing more
about Tampax tampons’
protection can give you

RETURN OF THE
PINK PANTHER

Peter Sellers triumphs again in his
classic role as the bumbling French
sleuth Inspector Clouseau in the
hilarious comedy ‘The Return of the
Pink Panther,’ ‘The ABC Friday Night
Movie,‘ Sept. 23.

Once again, Inspector Clouseau,
the accident-prone detective who
can't walk down a street without turn-
ing the pavement into a banana peel,
is off in hot pursuit of The Pink Pan-
ther, the priceless gem whose disap-
pearance sends Clouseau on a mad-
cap chase through France,
Switzerland, and Morocco. ’

Action and slapstick comedy
abound as Sellers is trapped in
revolving doors, steers trucks into
swimming pools, wrestles with
runaway vacuum cleaners, grapples
with monkeys and parrots, glues
himself to chairs, topples statues in
museums, and generally drives his
superior, Chief Inspector Dreyfus
(Herbert Lom), to insanity.
