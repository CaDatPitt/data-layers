New Alumni
Drive Aims To Top
Present Average

Starting a campaign among the
seniors who were graduated today,
the University Alumni Association
hopes to exceed the ten per cent of
alumni average membership of all
large ‘universities.

Onlpayment of one dollar, mem-
‘bers"0f the class of '37 will receive:
full privileges in the General Alum-
ni Association and in the individual
School alumni group; nine issues of
t-he-Al-umni Review; services of the
Alumni Placement Bureau, under the
'direction of N. Robert Seidle; and
preference in securing football tick-
ets in section 35 at all home games.
"Regular dues are three dollars.

Association Reorganized

After a period of inactivity dur-
ing the depression, the Association
was reorganized in August, I933.
First mention of an alumni group,
according to Mrs. Agnes L. Starrett,
assistant professor of “English and
author of the University history, was
in 1821. The T~i1ghman~Literary So-
ciety was organlzed then, holding its
ﬁrst reunion in 1835.

Today the Alumni Association con-
sists of more than 2500 members.
With ‘the bulk of its members'resid-
ing in Western Pennsylvania, the
group is represented in every state
and in 42 foreign countries.

There are 18 “organized Pitt Clubs,
15 in the state, and one each in New
York City, Chicago, and Southern
California. This fall, 12 more clubs
will be organized in Pennsylvania in
a move to knit state alumni closely
‘together.

‘Officers Listed

Heading the Association are: Nor-
man MacLeod, BA17, president; Earl
Crawford, BA16, ﬁrst vice-president;
W. Archie Weldin, E02, second vice-
presidcnt; Robert R. Gaw, Ph14,
treasurer; and John W. Hallock, E12,
secretary.

The Alumni Council, governing
group of the organization, has 36
members, who-are elected by each
school group, Pitt Clubs with a mem-
bership of 100, and include the past
president and the new officers of the
Association.

“By joining, alumni can build the
prestige of the institution, and keep
in touch with University progress and
classmates,” says Don Saunders, edi-
tor of the Alumni Review. “Gradu-
ates can still participate in Univer-
sity life.”

Keying the mood ~snd"the substance

of his talk to ‘present-day problems '
and conditions,  Oscar "F. Black- 1
Lutheran 
‘Church of the ‘Reformation, Wash-‘
ington, D. C., delivered ‘the annual 
‘commencement sermon zin Carnegie .

‘walder, pastor of ‘the

Music Hall ‘Sunday ‘morning.
“The Kind ‘of ‘A ‘Man To Build A

7Better Wor  ” was "the topic "that he

spoke on, devoting himself to ‘a dis-
cussion of the kind of qualities which
would ‘enable college ‘men and ‘women
successfully to meet the ‘challenge of
world conditions.
"Civilization ‘Off Balance”

“Our American civilization is oﬁ
balance,” he declared, “for in the
midst of plenty we are writing the
history of anation off balance. What
kind of a person can help us build
a better world?”

Answering this question, Dr. Black-

‘walder ‘named ‘two -“q‘uali'ties which

these persons should possess, “a
sense of personal direction” and
“the sense of social destiny.”

Many men liveby -a watch instead
of a compass, ‘he ~de‘clare‘d. “It is
necessary to set a watch as often as
onecrossesa time zone, but the com-
pass is good -all “around the world."

Second "Quality "Noted

Dr. «Bla'ckwaidcr’s ‘second ‘quality,
“a sense of social destiny,” "begins in
"“con‘ildence in the "aver-a'ge*man. It is
revealing to contrast ‘Aristotle and

«Jesus in ‘their respective -conceptions

of the worth of the average man,”

‘the speaker said.

"Here he went on to ‘point out that
Aristotle held that life truly “worth

‘living is ‘possible only for a very*few

men. ‘Oppositely, ‘Jesus ‘taught, said
Dr. Blackwal-der,“that«al1 ‘.‘life comes
fr'om‘G"o'd and thatlife mustbe cal-
culated on the ‘basis of eternity.
“The sensevof social “destiny means

'conﬁ‘d’in:g in the world’s -‘glorious

minorities. The greatest question in
the"woi‘ld is whethert-he “things that
‘we care ‘for ‘most -are at "the -‘mercy
of " the things ‘we «care -for-least . . .
Th-e -sense -of social ‘d’estiny"cl-imaxes
in so1ne'th‘in*g:'greater“ than social ‘jus-
tice. ’There is something "higher than
everything the Supreme Court stands
for and somethirngrnore iina .”

address and presentation of degrees. were the conferring of ﬁve
honorary degrees by the Univer-

tor of the East End Christian
Church, Dr. Jessup was'-intro-
duced by Chancellor John G.

Bowman, who presided at the

exercises.
The famed educator, discuss-

' ing the Cathedral,-declared that

“this is themost daring and-the
most beautiful thing ever at-
tempted on a University campus
and no one would have ever
dreamed of it, let alone carried
it out, except your distinguished
president, John Bowman.” _
Turning to world-wide.pro‘b-
lems, he said: “Weare now rais-
ing new questions about human

relationsaman roman, neighbor toneighbor, group to group; "and
we are witnessing «a ‘titanic struggle between ideas of group rela-
tionships and: individual responsibility. This cxplainsgovernment

“After all, are thesequestions new? Our vocabulary, withiits

«éancient lineage, -is evidence of

the fact that these issues were
‘at least wcll-‘enough known -2000
years ago to interest the best
politicians, ‘the best writers,
orators, dramatists,-“and poets of
that day. Words such as ‘democ-
‘racy.’ ‘demagogue,’ ‘politics,’
came straight from the “Greece
of 2500 years ago.

“Historians have a perma-
nent place in our affections,” IDr.
Jessup asserted further; “like-

wise ‘the philo.soph‘e,rs, the -
preachers, the priests, the.poets,

‘because all have sought to read
meaning into life to the end that
we ourselves might proceed to
our own mysterious future less

cidentally.”

FROM log cabin to skyscraper, .1787 to 1937.
Although this tale has been told and retold,

echoed and re-echoed during this now, closing

Sesquicentennial year, it still remains a fresh.
interesting, and dramatic one tolstudents and
graduates of the University, to citizens of Pitts-
burgh and surrounding Western Pennsylvania.
and to those beyond its physical but within its
educational inﬂuence. ' ’

Up the years from its humble beginning, when
its purpose was “to teach learned languages, Eng-
lish, mathematiks, and fencing” to pioneers west
of the Alleghenies, the University has undergone
physical development that has continually added
to the prestige of the district which it has served.

And just as its beginning was unassuming in
a physical sense, its educational purposes and fa-
cilities were limited by and adequate to thetype
of society which nurtured it. '

Today, one hundred fifty years later, while
masons and carpenters are working"»daily. to com-
plete the world's tallest, and one of its most beau-
tiful university buildings, its purposes have been
enlarged to lit a society that has grown increas-
ingly complex, whose problems are much more
subtle than those which faced the pioneering
West during the closing years of the eighteenth
century. - I - -

Today The Pitt News offers its congratulations
to the University on Commencement Day of its
one hundred ﬁftieth anniversary and to those
who have been the guiding influence during the
past few years of intensive development.

The historical past points to the University’s
ever-increasing growth and progress. The pres-
ent shows a culmination of this century and a
half of progress. And to judge by the past and
the present, the future will be a period of ad-
vancement towards the ultimate in service and
education which the changing society will de-
mand. ‘

Students who have graduated from the class
of 1937 today have had the misfortune of receiv-
ing their education during a time when the stu-
dent body and educational project crowded a
none-too-compact campus, a period during which
major construction work to make the campus
more compact and to give it a ﬁner atmosphere
was taking place. '

.Yet this, too, may in the end be of greater edu-
cational value than later graduation classes will
receive. There is something uplifting in con-
struction, someone has pointed out, and great
plans do not come to fruition in a single night.

Today is a day for congratulations—to those
who receive the degrees as a mark of their scho-
lastic efforts, and to the University itself on the
culmination of a full hundred ﬁfty years of edu-
cational service and intellectual enlightment.

University Contributes
To City’s Progress

By RICHARD COOPER

When we speak of “'the University of Pittsburgh” we
are apt to miss the full meaning of the phrase. The
reference “of Pittsburgh” is not merely a geographic
one. This point was emphasized by Chancellor Bowman
in his report to the Board of Trustees three years ago.

In speaking of “our spiritual heritage,” Dr. Bowman
suggested that the University is a direct outgrowth of
the social pattern set up by the little group of pioneers
who settled Pittsburgh and established Pittsburgh Acad-
emy. Pittsburgh developed from an isolated community
of home-producers to a great industrial and cultural
center; and with it developed the University.

Today Pittsburgh is no longer hidden from the rest
of the world by mountains. Its influence has become
\\'01'lr.l-\*.'i(lP lll ufl ii-'.:.ds of human endeavor. And yet,
for all this oxtensicii of culture and industry, Pittsburgh
has maintained its identity, its uniqueness. Its problems,
its prejudices, its achievements are its own.

It is appropriate, then, that this community should ﬁnd
representation in a University which will stand as a
locus of its success. By no mere accident, then, do we
see a Cathedral of Learning, combining the triumphs
of science and of architecture, as the symbol of such a
University.

Thus the University Placement Bureali, ldbated it'll

the dean of men’s oﬁice, Room 801, Cathedral, assumes
an important function in University affairs.

The Bureau acts as a clearing house for the business
ﬁelds. Employers get in touch with the studentswia
the Bureau, and then hold interviews in offices provided
by the University. Other employers leave itto the judg-
ment of N. Robert Seidle, present director of the Place-
ment Bureau, to send them the better: graduates. 8

Ari enviable record has been compiled by the Bureau,
especially in the depression years. From 1930, the de-
partment has successively beenunder thedirectorship
of Lester Perry, BA; Chester Benne'tt,,”E _(.,,1930-33) ;- J.

According to Seidle, the Placement Bureau has_-_:_.had
better success in obtaining employment ‘for its graduates
this year than at any other time since the start of ‘the

comparatively good, this year’s' ﬁgure runs ‘about 25%

Life On Campusfisi 
By MILTON c.. LEHMANMT .  ‘ l_
When William Jacob ‘Holland was eh.a.nbellor'
of Western University and “Uncle Dan” Carhart
was dean of the School of Engineering, Paul L.
Hay was president of the University-f{fC.ourant7’
Association, editors and publishers of the .Uni-
versity’s monthly journal. V * ‘

Today Mr. Hay, a graduate engineer in ‘the sales and
contracting engineering business, is a charter member
of the Alumni Association, and has belonged to Alumni.
Council for many years. _ '

Forty-two years ago-, the engineers were the undis-
puted campus leaders, according to Mr. Hay. Out of;

his graduation class of 18—most of the -125 studentsm

who enrolled as freshmen having dropped.-out for one.-
reason or anothcr——only six were graduated from the...
College. Twelve members of the class Awereﬂengineers.
Supervised Publication 1 v 5 

An engineer himself, Mr. Hay’s duties’.-"as president"

)f the Couraiit, a monthly combination of news, humor,

and departmental features, were ‘to take charge of the»,

. Association and supervise‘ the editing of-the publication.

“The Courant,” Mr Hay pointed out, “was sponsored.
and sanctioned by the University but its business mat-..
ters were its own. A business manager was in charge
of advertising, which, together with the subscription
charges, were our sole assets. But we managed to» make
ends meet.” -: -'   3 ‘.7; ’*

Besides his presidential and editorial duties,’Mr._-Hay
foundtime to serve as president of the Andrews Scien-.*
tiﬁc Society and as a member of . the ‘Glee’ Club.'?'-:E2g'—
cept for varsity football, the Glee Club was the .most
important activity on campus. . ._ .

“We didn’t have as much free time then as7"'Pitt stu-X
dents have today. We started in at 8:30 o’clock and
spent the full day taking the required subjects‘ of the
curriculum,” Mr. Hay said. '  ‘ " ‘ .

Divisions of the University at that time were;the-Col-
lege of Literature and Arts; the School of Engineering,
einbra_cing the departments of mechanical, civil, and
electrical engineering; the Western Pennsylvania Medi-
cal College; the Reineman Maternity Hospital_;’ and the.
Allegheny Observatory. Dr. Keeler had just succeeded
Professor Langley as head of the Observatory, the lat-
ter having been appointed secretary of the Smithsonian
Institute. » ‘ I .5 "' "

Had Share Of Excitement

“Did we have any excitement in those .days?_ . Well,
we had our share of it,” Mr. Hay rei;narked«w'ith a twin-
kle. “I remember the day the studentsjand I suppose
lhad something to do with it—hung a skeleton in chapel.
Dr. Holland, who led the morning service, began as
usual. He didn’t notice the skeleton until ‘several ‘of 
made an outbreak. But they never did ﬁnd out who
was responsible, although they tried ‘theirzbest to corral
the ringleaders.” .~ - . . j - V

According to Mr. .Ha_v, students -had-.-a closer contact
with their professors than they do today. The,,e.lassesv
were smaller, and almost every student at_ the University-

knew every other student. The total e__nro'llmei,it in”1895_..

was about 300, M_r. Hay estimated.

Teams; Quintet Leads

Panther-_-athletes chose “an ideal sea-
son when..'th'eychose, consciously or
unconsciously, to make 1936-37 the
year of ‘their greatest efforts and
most outstanding successes.

That such‘ ‘a 'year_ of commemo-
ration and festivity as the University
Sesquicentennial should be entered
into by all departments of the school
is desirable, and the department of
athletics, from all appearances, par-
ticipated to the fullest extent.

National recognition and suprem-
acy ln' competition placed Pitt teams
at the highest all-around peak. in the
century and a half of the Univer-
sity’s—' ex"istence‘.'Trophies, symbolic of
accomplishments in football, basket- A
ball, andtrack are "now accumulat-
ing dust in Hagan’s cupboard. ' .

Football, advanced to the prime
position. in the _collegiate athletic
curriculum, looked to the Golden
Panthers for leadership.“ Champions

of the East, the Pitt grid "team be-' .

came" the ﬁrst to receive the Lambert
trophy, awarded by a committee of
sports ‘writers’ and sportsmen ‘to the"
best team in this section of the coun-
try. As a result, the Panthers were
invited‘ to participate in the Rose
Bowl as representatives of Eastern
gridiron prowess. A i I

Vjctors in the national champion-
ship-reckoning game, the Pitt foot-
ball ‘team was acclaimedthe nation's
best. ‘Only Minnesota ranked on a
plane with the Panthers. Ave ‘Daniell,
Pitt tackle, was given a substantial
All-American rating with a first
team berth. '

Just as Sutherland football is char-
acterized by ‘winning teams, Carlson
basketball. has been gaining the same
distinction. This year was no excep-
tion, and as titles go, it brought more
than has ever been the Panther floor

linlwi‘. ci‘._\> schools have gotten to-
gcther in round-robin play, Pitt won
the city championship by defeating
Carnegie Tech twice and downing’
even with the ever-troublesome
Dukes.

In the four years of the Eastern
Intercollegiate Basketball Confer-
ence’s life, the Panthers had won the
crown three times. This year, in a
play-oﬁ’ game in Philadelphia, Pitt
rolled past Temple 35-27, to win its
fourth Conference championship.

Track Breezes In

The sport that zephyred into the
national sportlight this year was
track. Rising along on the upward
trend that started when Carl Olson
became coach, the Pitt cinder squad
reached Rose Bowl proportions in the
ﬁeld of its endeavor. For the first
time in 20 years of Pitt trying, the
Panthers won the IC4A track and

field championships in the annual

meet “held iniRandall’s Island Sta-
dium'in the beginning of June.
The ﬁnest individual Pitt track

conquest was turned in by a lithe-

long striding freshman who brought
to Pitt its first Olympic victory.
Johnny Woedruff became the Olym-
pic 800-meter champion in the games
at Berlin last summer. H-is perform-
ances during the past season have
helped immeasurably in bringing the
Pitt track record to its present place.

These general honors represented
the Pitt sports year in degree of ac-
complishment. Retrospection brings
to mind those moments of absolute
greatness which made the Pitt ath-

_letic year. Stebbins’ scamper against

Commencement this morning in the
Stadium became the last official un-
dergraduatc action of a group of Pitt

. students whose most newsworthy col-

lege performances were enacted in
the same setting. These were that
‘strong-armed group of Pitt athletes
whose diploma-receiving ceremony

Virtually each Pitt team, lost the
men who were its standout players
duringthc year just ended. In some
cases it was one of the greatest play-
ers in the history of that particular
sport at the University.

Such was positively the case of Bob
Madden, senior tennis captain. Mad-
den ranks with Eddie Jacobs as Pitt’s
best tennis players. During his col-
legiate play-day."Madden was Middle
Atlantic Collegiate singles and dou-
bles champion, number one man on
the varsity squad for three years, and
the number one ranking player in the
l’ittsb,urgh district for the past two.

Football Loss Great

was able to do all autumn. From the

- center of the line Averill Daniel, All,
' American tackle, and Biff Glassford,
. ' ﬁrst string guard, will be blocked by
- .a sheepskin. Bobby LaRue, another

athlete who has played regular ball
his entire three years of..varsity elig-
ibility and who was the star of the
Rose Bowl game, will step out into

. the coaching ﬁeld.

Two of the leaders of Pitt's great-
est track team will be missing next‘
year when Coach Olson calls the boys
together. Harold Tost, who was the
captain of the ﬁrst Pitt lC4A cham-

' 'pion and who was a great distance
'iunner, will graduate.

Penn Relay
javelin champion in ’36,. Gene Taano
will graduate with ‘the distinction of
never having been beaten by an op-
ponent in three years of dual meets.

Only one regular will graduate
from the Eastern Intercollegiate Bas-
ketball Conference’ championship
team, but. his play last year was rated
the best. That's Billy Jesko, captain
of this season's floor outﬁt, all-Con-
ference forward, all-city and 'all-dis-
trict honor winner, and high scorer
of the Pitt team.

The Panther swimming team loses

Mayor Scully Speaks

Preceding Dr. Kerr's address,
Mayor Cornelius D. Scully spoke on
“The Cathedral and Pittsburgh.” Pay-
ing tribute to Chancellor Bowman for
“having effected the transfer from the
stuff that dreams are made of into a
reality of steel and stone,” he termed
the Cathedral a new symbol of Pitts-
burgh,

In an unscheduled part of ‘the pro-
gram, faculty members surprised
Chancellor Bowman by presenting
him with a gold medallion, commem-
orating his “untiring efforts in con-
ceiving, adopting, and starting the Ca-
thedral of Learning." On the medal-
lion was inscribed, “They shall ﬁnd
wisdom here and faith, in steel and
stone, in character and thought. They
shall find beauty, adventure and mo-
ments of high victory.”

After ten years of “conception, planning, ﬁ-
nancing, and construction,” the Stephen Collins
Foster Memorial was officially dedicated on the
evening of June 2. Dr. Josiah K. Lilly, donor of
Kathryn Meisle,

Metropolitan Opera contralto, University officials, and
a string ensemble from -the Tuesday Musical Club par-

‘he entire program was devoted to presentations of
the Pittsburgh composer’s best known songs. The string
orchestra opened with transcriptions of six of his best
known l-ieder, and Miss Meisle followed these with three
solos comprising “Come Where My Love Lies Dream-
ing"; “Oh, Susanna”; and “My Old Kentucky Home.”

In his talk Dr. Lilly outlined the way in which he built
up the collection, and how he hoped it would be used.
Earlier in the day the Pittsburgh Public School chil-
dren presented a program prepared by students ‘from
the elementary grades. Dr. Will Earhart, director of
music in the Schools; conducted a student chorus with
‘orchestral accompaniment. Tableaux were arranged by

NORMAN MacLEOD—-President

General Alumni Association

There are approximately 10,000 separate items in the
Fosteriana collection housed in the left wing of the
building and the storage room below, made up of man-
uscripts and letters, ﬁrst editions, early and modern-
copies of the composer’s sheet music, personal posses-
sions, recordings, and various newspaper and magazine
articles related to the man and his works.

In cases lining the wing are authentic reproductions
and reprints of the songs as they first emerged from
the small printing presses scattered over this section of V,
the country during, Foster’s lifetime. Included on many
of the pages were advertisements for the ﬁrm of
“Wa'ter’s Golden Harp for Sunday Schools,” enlivened
by a blurred engraving of a gentleman with large,side§-
burns standing besides his instrument. - , .

Occupying a prominent place in the exhibit is Fos-
ter’s melodeon, with which he conducted serenading.
parties in Pittsburgh during his lifetime. It has a range-
of approximately ‘three octaves, and can still be played, _
as was demonstrated in the broadcast over the NBC _
network during the afternoon program.

The committee in charge of the memorial includes
John Weber, chairman, and secretary of. the Univer-
sity Chancellor Bowman; Mrs. Will Earhart, Tuesday
Musical Club; Dr. John W. Oliver, headof the history -
department and Fletcher Hodges, Jr., secretary. and .‘
curator of the Foster Hall collection. , ‘ ,

Complete List
Of Candidates

Announced

The following lists of names make
up a complete tabulation of candi-
dates for degrees, including seniors,
graduate students, and students in
professional schools. These add up to
the grand total of 1120, exclusive of
five honorary degrees ‘conferred.

Appearance of a name on this list
is presumptive evidence of gradua-
tion, but it must not in any sense be
regarded as conclusive. The diploma
of the University, signed and sealed
by its proper officers, remains the of-
ﬁcial testimony to the possession of
3 degree.
