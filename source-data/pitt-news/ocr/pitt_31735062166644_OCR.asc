Discusses Appropriations Hassle 

by LINDA GOLDSTEIN
(See editorial, “Time To
Legislate,” page 4)

Pennsylvania Gov. Raymond
P, Shafer (Rep.) lashed out at
House Minority Leader Herbert
Fineman (D.-Phila.) during an
exclusive Pitt News interview
on the legislative stalemate on
all appropriations Wednesday
afternoon. Speaking at the Gate-
way Center in Pittsburgh, Shaf-
er, after he had taped his month-
ly “Conversation with the Gov-
ernor” program at KDKA-TV
studios, said of Fineman: “He
knows we have had our doors
open to discuss the appropria-
tion problems with the legisla-
tors openly and candidly.”

Shafer’s comment was in re-
sponse to Fineman’s criticism of
the Governor, which appeared

 

in Wednesday's Pitt News:
"There «is nothing conciliatory
on the part of the Republican
administration. The Governor is
ﬁrm and inflexible.”

“Fineman’s statement is fur-
ther evidence of the Democratic
Party's policy to obstruct the
needed programs. The sooner
that thinking members on the
Democratic side of the aisle rec-
ognize that these tactics are
hurting the people of Pennsyl-
vania, the sooner Pennsylvania
will continue to move forward,”
the Governor declared.

Gov. Shaver also answeredt he
following questions:

>Should educational appro-
priations be subject to partisan
politics?

“Absoluiteily not. Programs
that involve the education of our

young people should not get
into the ﬁeld of partisan poli-
tics. It should not become a par-

uwivgaszryl

tisan issue when we're dealing
with our most important asset.”

>Is there a plan to remove
education from the political
arena?

“I don’t think there’s any
phse of our representative Way
of life that can be removed from
the political -arena. All items in-
volving appropriation of public
monies should‘ -remain within
the structure of our legislative
process, but on a level which
would get the job done.”

> When will the appropriation
conﬂict be resolved?

“I am optismistic that it will
be resolved in the near future,
especially since the Democrats
have switched from their total
obstructionism to offer help, at
least partially.”

> Will the state-related insti-

tutions be subject to a yearly
appropriations hassle before
they receive their funds?

“I hope -not, but as long as we
have human beings, we're going
to have differences of opinion.
Some members of -my own par-
ty have not joined the team in
voting for the revenue meas-
ures.”

> Do you agree with Dr. Da-
vid II. Kurtzman’s statement
that the legislators harly look-
ed at the recommendations of
the Tax Study Commission which
be chaired for you?

“llhe legislators closed their
minds on several of the recom-
mendations before they were
ever discussed. There was abso-
lute adamacy on the ‘part of the
legislators on the propsed one
per cent personal income tax.”

Johnstown Dedication
Hosts Gen. Eisenhower

by PAUL STOLLER

Former President Dwight D. Eisenhower was the hon-
ored guest at the dedication of’ the new campus of the
University at J ohnstown (UPJ). General Eisenhower re-
received an honorary Doctor of Laws from Wesley W.
Posvar, chancellor of the University.

During the dedication ceremonies,.Eisenho.wer stated
that gaining an education is one sure way of meeting the
challenges of life. Eisenhower said that those people who
meet the challenges of our society become good American

Critchﬁeld
Announces

Meal Policy

Jack Critchﬁeld, dean of Stu-
dent Affairs, reiterated a new
Towers and Schenley meal poli-
cy Thursday to The Pitt News.
The policy, in effect now, pro-
vides meals on a cash basis in
both cafeterias. In addition, any
student may eat in the Towers
on a cash basis except from
11:45 a.m. to 12:15 p.m. and
4:45 to 5:15 p.m.

The innovation is in answer
to “student, fiaculty, and admin-
istration” requests. The former
non-cash basis “precluded dorm
students eating with non-‘board
contract students.”

Dean Critchﬁeld discussed an
unfortunate by-product of the
change, which involved “stu-
dents who had taken advantage
of the service and used their
meal ticket in the Towers and
then in Schenley.”

Critchﬁeld called this a situa-
tion which “we can’t tolerate.”
To combat the “unfair advan-
tage on the part of very few
students,” the office of Student
Affairs has established a proce-
dure which, stated Critchﬁeld,
“goes into effect immediately.”

Critchﬁeld explained that af-
ter one offense, the meal tickets
will be picked up and turned
into Auxiliary Enterprises. The
student will be charged a $3 fee
to obtain a second meal ticket.
If the meal ticket has to be con-
fiscated a second time, the tick-
et will be forwarded to the Dean
of Student Affairs, and no meal
ticket will be issued without fur-
ther investigation.

citizens. Those who have failed
to meet the challenges, stated
Eisenhower, become “the hippies
that we despise.”

At a news .co-nference directly
irefore the dedication, Eisenhow-
er indicated that he was disturb-
ed by ‘the current inﬂationary
trends. “The spending should be
cut in the areas of space ex-
ploration,” stated Eisenhower.

Eisenhower also stated that
he would not be able to go to
Vietnam because of his health.
“My doctors would never let me
go there,” he pointed out.

Delving into politics, Eisen-
hower‘ stated that he saw “no
reason why anyone in any pro-
fcssion (movies) should not take
a position of political responsi-
bility. I’m all for the profession-

Dorm Construction Stalled

As GSA Approves Plans 

Basic plans for the new dormitories on the hill behind Pitt Stadium‘ have been
approved by the General State Authority (GSA), but “it would take a lot of pushing”
to have construction start in September, 1968, according to Lile Creighton, assistant

director of physical plant.

The dormitories, which will house about 1648 students, are being partially built
on a cemetery bought by the University. A court fight over moving of bodies may, if
appeal is made, hold up the moving for as long as 40 days. “And once we get approval,

it will take about a year to move the bodies,” added Creighton.

Salisbury’s experiences in Rus-
sia during this trip and on an-
other trip which took him to Si-

what he called “the rising con-
flict between Russia and Red
China” and to write his boo-k,
To Moscow~and Beyond, a re-
port of the Soviet Union at that
‘time and its relations with Red
China.

Born in Minneapolis in 1908,
Salisbury attended the Universi-
ty of Minnesota where he edited
the college paper. Upon gradua
tion in 1930, he covered the end
of the Prohibition gang wars
and the trial of Al Capone for
UPI’s Chicago bureau. In 1940,
he was transferred to the for-

Housing Situation Critical

by IVAN ABRAMS »

“The off-campus housing
situation is critical,” stated
Louis McClinden, Assistant
Dean of Men in Charge of
Off-Campus Housing. “I
know situations similar to
that of‘ Pamela Robinson oc-
cur, especially in the South
Oakland area.”

McClinden feels that the cause
of inadequate housing being
rented to students is that “peo-
ple are Willing to pay big renxts
for these dwellings. As long as
the money is paid, the landlords
will be willing to take it.”

Although Oakland is not tech-
nically a slum, the density o-f
population is equal to -that of
the Hill District or Manchester.
As the University continues to
grow, both the overcrowl-ing and
the housing shortage will grow.

“The only solution to the hous-
ing shortage,” said McClinden,
“would be more University-own-
ed housing so that we would not
have to fall back on the run-
down dwellings in the are-a.”
There is no legal way that the
University could put pressure on
the landlords, he said,‘ although
individuals or groups of individ-
uals might be able to do so.

But one individual who tried
this approach, Miss Robinson, is
still living -in her condemned
apartment.

Miss Robinson does not plan
to remain at the 256 Oakland
Ave. address if she can ﬁnd an-
other apartment to move to.
“I’m looking everywhere for a

place,” she -says, “but the only
places available -are open pre
cisely because the landlord was
asking so much rent that no
student could live -in them, or
else they’re in unﬁt condition.

“I did ﬁnd one place that was
cheap,” she states, “but the land-
lord said that if I wanted to take
it I would have to paint the
walls myself, buy and lay my
own linoleum, kill the bugs and
roaches, and furnish the place.
What student has either the
time or the money to do that
kind of work, especially when
it's the landlord's responsibil-
ity?” asks Miss Robinson.

Although the Health Depart-
ment has told Miss Robinson
that her present apartment is to
be vacated ,she was also told
to pay her rent to the landlord.
“Howver, I’m talking with Neigh-
borhood Legal Services about
withholding my next payments,”
she stated.

‘Miss Robin.son’s landlord has
apparently reacted to the vari-
ous County inspections without

-worry. “Indeed,” says Miss Rob-

inson, “when. the Department
of Building Inspection looked
through the house, the landlord
accompanied the inspector on
his tour.”

No new violations have been
ﬁled, although Health Depart-
ment inspectors declared on their
first visit that building inspec-
tion would also ﬁnd cause to
condenm the apartment.

Although the renting of a cel-
lar apartment is liable to a $100
ﬁne, Miss Robinson's landlord is

Draft Evadcrs Leave U. S.

by DAVID LLOYD-JONES

If there were a place
Where a young American
could move to without cul-
ture shock, earn a respect-

able living and escape the
major stresses of life, a
good number might choose
to live in Canada.

With a population of 20 mil-
lion, a Way of life that is only
marginally different from the
American, political freedom, job
opportunities and, for some most
importantly, no conscription,
Canada is easy to make the
transition to. About 15,000 Amer-
icans move to Canada every
year.

Until recently this migration
has been more than matched by
the “Brain Drain” Canadians
worry about—the several thou-
sand nurses, teachers and pro-
duction workers who move each
year into the States. But this
year, for the ﬁrst time since the
war, it «is expected that migra-
tion to Canada will outweigh
immigration to the US.

If the US is the home of the
brave and the land of the free,
Canada is the home of the peace-
ful and land of the free. Re-
tired people come here to es-
cape the high taxation of the
warfare state. The middle-aged

Am-eriicans are more and more
moving to Canada to evade the
draft and involvement in the
war. Canadian imimgration offi-
c-ials have no record of the num-
ber of immigrants who were 1-A
before they arrived, but Marc
Satin who runs the Toronto of-
fice of the anti-draft program
says he gets about half-la-dozen
draft-evaders going through t'he
office a day, and says that the
load is about the same in of-
ﬁces in Montreal and Vancou-
ver. There are also eight small
offices and groups helping draft
evaders in other cities. Thou-

sands of others simply cross the 0

border as landed immigrants
without -contacting groups con-
cerned with draft evaders.

Since Canada's uniﬁed armed '

services are manned by volun-
teers, Canada does not recog-
nize “draft evasion’-’ or “inter-
national ﬂight to avoid prosecu-
tion” as crimes, though these
are punished by ﬁve and ten
years in jail in the US. Conse
quently, draft evaders cannot be
extradited.

a.m. tapes are used. Most of the
programs are designed -to bring
music, humor, and news to the

The station is divided into
four parts: programming, op-

Mr. Smith is very happy over

“We are a very close-knit group,
but with many diversiﬁed inter-

Academic ' Freedom Guaranteed

Court Upholds Due Process

by VVALTER GRANT

WASHINGTON (CPS)~Three
recent Federal court decisions
iray have far-reaching signifi-
cance in guaranteeing due pro-
cess and academic freedom for
students on college and univer-
sity campuses.

The decisions uphold the rights
of students to freedom of ex-
pression and prohibit adminis-
trations from expelling students
without specifying charges and
holding a hearing.

In all three case-s, students
who had been expelled from
their schools were ordered read-
mitted by the court.

In Montgomery, Ala., 21 Fed-
eral judge ordered Troy State
College, Troy, Ala., to readmit a
student editor wl1o had been ex-
pelled after a dispute with col-
lege officials over the censor-
ship of an editorial he wrote for
the student newspaper last
spring.

In the second case, the US

Court of Appeals ordered How-l

ard University in Washington,
D. C., to take back four students
who had been expelled for al-
le-ged black power activities on
campus. And in Columbus, S. C.,
a Federal District judge ruled
thart three students were unlaw-
fully suspended from South
Carolina State College last Feb-
ruary.

In the Troy State College case,
Federal District Judge ‘Frank
Johnson, Jr. ruled that “a state
cannot force a college student
to forfeit his constitutionally
protected rights of freedom of
expression as a condition to his
attending a state-supported in-
stitution.”

The judge ordered the college
to readmit Gary C. Dickey, a 24-
ye-ar-old Vietnam veteran who
was expelled as a result of the
censorship controversy last
spring.

Dickey, a member of the edi-
torial board of the Tropolitan,
the student newspaper, had writ-
ten an editorial supporting Dr.
Frank Rose, president of the
University of Alabama, in his
strong stand for academic free-
dom during a Well-publicized

controversy last year. Dr. Rose
was lined up against several
state legislators and then Gov.
George Wallace in the academic
freedom battle.

Dickey was forbidden to print
the editorial by Troy State Pres-
ident Ralph W. Adams, a close
friend of the Wallace adminis-
tration. The newspaper’s facul-
ty advisor, supported by Presi-
dent Adams, suggested that
Dickey instead print an editori-
al raising dogs in North Caro-
lina. .

The newspaper, however, pub-
lished the word “censored” and
blank space where the editorial
was to have appeared,

Troy State notiﬁed Dickey in
August that he could not return
to the school this semester.
Dickey took the matter to court,
and Judge Johnson said the stu-
dent could not be expelled with-
out a hearing.

Page 4 — THE PITT NEWS —— ‘Friday, September 29, 1967

Although our State Legislature has made provisions to appropri-
ate money for the state scholarships, there is still no definite timetable
for the passage of the bulk of appropriations, including the aid to the
three state-related institutions. So even though the Democrats agreed
to support the corporate income levy, thereby providing the scholar-
ship money, the stalemate continues in our state government.

Wednesday afternoon Pennsylvania Gov. Raymond P. Shafer
told The Pitt News that “programs that involve the education of our
young people should not get into the field of‘ partisan politics.” He
further stated that he didn’t think that “there’s any phase of our repre-
sentative way of life that can be removed from the political arena.”
This accounts for the dilemma of our state-related University, as it
i's forced to borrow between $5 to $6 million to meet its operating
expenses until the Legislature appropriates its funds. Obviously, edu-
cational matters should not fall prey to the brand of partisan politics
which characterizes our State Legislature. However, since our funds
are appropriated in the budget, we cannot help but be adversely af-

fected by our state association when budget hassles occur.

Democrats denounce Republicans and vice versa. Gov. Shafer
said of Democrat House Minority Leader Herbert Fineman’s denuncia-
tion of him: “His statement is further evidence of the Democratic

Episode Three

Frat Man Overwhelms All

The story so far: Fresh Man
enlists the aid of The Commuter,
and indirectly, Dorm Rat, in his
attempt to save a commuting
freshman from Senior harass-
ment.

THE MILITANT mob of
milling commuters waxed
impatient as they stood on
the Forbes Avenue side of
the Student Union. Fresh
Man, alias Sal Sewickley,
and who fights a never-end-
ing battle in the defense of
all first-year student, stood
next to his chum, The Com-
muter, Mobilizer of Com-
muting Students.

Strolling down Bigelow
Boulevard, followed by a
gaggle of Swooning coeds,
attended by a swarm of ob-
sequeious pledges, was stud-
ly' Frat Man, porting a Ben-
son & Hedges 100 between
his impeccable teeth.

Frat Man, nattily attired
in a fashionable J. Press
blue double-breasted blazer,
Gant Oxf’ord with Brooks
Brothers paisley, subdued
glen-plaid trousers, and
Italian-made shoes with
buckles, always walked with
with one hand gently placed
over his long, dark, hair,
lest it blow embarassingly
in the wind.

  The  

  

FRAT MAN was tanned
under the Bimini sun, his
hair done by expert British
tonsorial engineers, and al-
lowed only the few Best
Shoeshine Boys in America,
as designated by Esquire
Magazine, to handle all his
footwear. In short, Frat
Man was oh—so-cool.

Frat Man, who belonged
to Alpha Sigma Sigma, was
constantly barraged by girls
for dates, to which his fav-
orite reply to those not at-
tractive enough for his own
taste was always an extend-
ed fist, second and third fin-
gers raised, and a hissing,
“Two’s a crowd. Buss a-
while, huh babe?” Occas-
sionally, he would mutter
under his breath, “I’d rath-
er have a Stadium, myself.”

And now he was approach-
ing Commutter and Fresh
Man, and the both of them
shivered in their tracks at
the very prospect of his
presence.

FRAT MAN sauntered up
to the group and stopped.

.“Time to whet my whis-
tle,” he breathed. Frat Man
turned around to his trail-
ing entourage, causing the
girls to f'aint from his very
visage, and causing sensa-

tions of utter terror to
course through the pledges’
bodies. He extended his fist
-and made the customary
“V” sign to a cowering
pledge.

“Two’s a crowd? Sir,” of-
fered the pledge, meekly.

Frat Man frowned. “Two
fingers J&B, boy,” sneered
the Alpha Sig. “Give me
your pledge book, boy,” he
commanded.

HE WROTE, on the ap-
propriate page: “This boy
insubordinate — suggest
eighty lashes.”

Turning to Fresh Man,
Frat Man said, “You a
freshman, boy?”

“Yes,” replied Fresh Man.

“SIGN UP for rush, boy?”

‘(No.97 '

“Hmph,” he grunted,
turning to Commuter. “How
about you, boy?”

“I SIGNED up last year,
sir. I was over your house
every day but I never got a
bid.”

“Oh yes, I remember now.
Local boy. Two brothers, one
sister. One car, ’49 Chevy.
Father makes 7 grand.
Stamp collector. Like Eddie
Fisher. I remember now.
Hmmm.”

Frat Man turned to an-
other spineless pledge and
said, “Boy, dash off a let-
ter to the Playboy Advisor
and find out the discreetest
way to get these creeps to
bug off'.”

“OH FRAT Man,” plead-
ed Fresh Man, “Some sen-
iors are trying to sell a
poor freshman a Cathedral
Elevator Permit. Won’t you
help,”

Frat Man curled his lip
and raised an eyebrow.
“Boy,” he said, “It’s your
hassle, not mine.”

The gang of pledges ap-
plauded, the girls swooned,
and Frat Man continued on

‘ to Frankie Gustine’s, where

he was hailed by one and
all, and given his favorite
booth, far in the back, and
proceeded to drink himself
insensate. ‘

Time To Legislate

Party’s policy to obstruct the needed programs. The sooner that think-
ing members on the Democratic side of the aisle recognize that these
tactics are hurting the people of Pennsylvania, the sooner Pennsyl-
vania will continue to move forward.”

Gov. Shafer’s remarks were in response to Fineman’s statement
ment that “there is nothing conciliatory on the part of the Republican
administration. The Governor is firm and inflexible.”

The above retorts characterize the continual accusations that
members of both parties engage in, so intent on discrediting one an-
other that they have in effect discredited themselves by the ineffectual
operation of our state government.

Gov. Shafer’s adamacy that there is no need for partisan politics
to affect the education of our young people should be transferred from
right—sounding words into deeds. If both parties are respectively con-
cerned about fulfilling their obligations not only to the state-related
universities, but to the manifold state programs dependent on state
funds, we urge them to stop denouncing one another and act.

The public has been exposed to this public bickering for far too
long, and both sides should have about run out of names to call one
another by now. Hopefully, they will now return to their desks in Har-
risburg and do the work they were elected to do—legislate.

TenantQuestions
Valentine Letter

Editor, The Pitt News:

I disagree with William R.
Valentine, J r.’s letter of Sept. 25.
Students in Oakland are victims
of one of the highest rent scales
in the city——a very upsetting
fact when one considers that
Oakland has been classiﬁed by
the Federal Government as one
of the eight poverty areas of
Pittsburgh. It’s only reasonable
that one should pay less rent to
live in a poverty area, yet Mr.
Valentine defends the landlords’
exploitative tactics.

One reason for the high rents,
Mr. Valentine claims, is that
“taxes are higher in Oakland.”
Higher than what? Not the rest
of Pittsburgh. Taxes throughout
the city are on a standard, based
on property assessment. If Oak-
land is a poverty area, it stands
to reason that taxes are less
here than in East Liberty,
Shadyside, Dormont, or any
other area of Pittsburgh save
only the ghettos.

Mr. Valentine complains that
little can be done to repair an
apartment without a registered
plumber, carpenter, or electri-
cian and because these services
are so expensive, the landlord is
justiﬁed in raising the rent. If
the wiring catches ﬁre (not an
uncommon occurence) the land-
lord calls an electrician in to re-
pair the faulty wiring, then
raises the tenant’s rent for hav-
ing had to repair the damage
that was the landlords and not
the tenant’s fault.

Moreover, the Oakland land-
lords do not always call in reg-
istered electricians and plumb-
crs to maintain the apartments.
No electrician would have rig-
ged up such a galaxy of mask-
ing tape, bare sockets, and ex-
posed copper wires as is draped
along my walls. As for the
plumbing expenses, I have only
one sink in which to wash my
face, feet, carrots, stocking, and
radishes (I have a faucet with
running water above my bed
that hardly counts). How much

, expense could that one sink be?

Nor is such ﬁagrant negligence
unique to my present apartment.
Last year my apartment just
about went up in ﬂames (a cer-
tiﬁed electrician who was ap-
palled at the mess told me) be-
cause my landlord had wired
everything in three rooms to the
circuit in one room. When the

wire ﬁnally gave out, I was left

IIHIHIHIHIHIH

with only one bare bulb in the
hall for light and it was days
before my landlord would re-
pair the wiring.

The apartments I’ve lived in
aren’t exceptional in their high
rent or decrepit condition. I’ve
talked with students in Oakland
who have to boil water for their
baths throughout the winter be-
cause their landlords wouldn’t
repair the water heater, stu-
dents Whose walls are falling
down because their landlord re-
fuses to cap the brick, students
whose hair has been burned by
faulty gas stoves.

Students take care of their
apartments as well as they 92!}:
but it’s irksome to have to clean
a stove several times a day be-
cause a rusty pipe leaks direct-
ly on to it, or to sweep a floor
that peels off with the broom.
Students are respo»ns'ible peo-
ple; it’s time for the landlords
to accept their share of the re-
sponsibility in maintaining de-
cent housing conditions.

No doubt Mr. Valentine is one
of the very respo-nsible land-
lords in Oakland, but too many
other irresponsible landlords
have made Oakland an expen-
sive, unsafe, and unpleasant
place to live.

Student Urges
Pitt-C.M.U.Link

Editor, The Pitt News.‘

Perhaps Chancellor Posvar
will try to draw the University
of; Pittsburgh into closer con-
tact with Carnegie Mellon Uni-
versity. The advantages from

(cooperation ‘between these two

schools can only beneﬁt both of
them. Ex-Chancellor Litchﬁeld
appeared to have realized this.
He was one of the developers of
the now defunct Panther Hol-
low Project. He planned to join
the two schools by a co-mplex of
buildings in the Hollow. Litch-
ﬁeld believed in a massive pro-
gram of construction to bring
the two institutions closer to-
gather, perhaps a less monumen-
tal and spectacular technique
could be implemented to build
a brain-chain over the Hollow.

The process involves having a
closer relationship between the
academic departments’ of the
two universities. Why can't the
Theater History Depa tment at
our school work in cooperation
with the Drama Department at

(Crmtimtcrl from I’(1_r/0 4.)
Carnegie-Mellon. Both Carnegie
and Pitt have engineering pro-
grams —~ can’t students take
courses at either school — or
can't faculty members work on
joint projects? Certainly the
newly-formed Liberal Arts
School at Carnegie-Mellon could
use some of the professors from
Pitt, and couldn’t Pitt improve it-
self by adding some new courses
found only at Carnegie-Mellon?

The emphasis on closer ties
between education institutions
has worked at a number of New
England colleges. Harvard and
MIT combined thier talents in
their Joint Institute of Urban
Affairs. Carnegie-Mellon and our
university might follow their ex-
ample by pooling talent from
our Social Work School, Grad-
uate School of Public and Inter-
national Affairs and Carnegie-
Me1l0n’s Department of Arch-
i‘-ec and Graduate School of Ur-
ban Design.

The pressing needs of the city
could then be focused on with a
wider view than either of the
two schools could accomplish
separately.

The rewards from entering in
joint ventures with Carnegie-
Mellon would appear to far out
shadow the loss of personal
glory either school would get
going it alone on many particu-
lar projects.

Social Work Student

Former Senator
Rips Union Bill

Editor, . The Pitt News:

I was amazed to read Paul
Stoller’s article “Sg Senate Res-
olution Urges Revamped Stu-
de-nit Union” in the Sept. 15 is-
sue of the Pitt News. I feel this
article is glowing testimony of
SG’s attempt to gain the best
for the student in the most mis-
guided manner.

2. As a recent Pitt graduate,
past SG ‘Senator, and past pub-
lic relations chairman, I see the
situation as a terrible confusion
of issues on SG’—s part. This ag-
gravated by several unwarrant-
ed charges.

3. I feel this action is in dan-

ger of destroying all the gains
made last year towards getting
a new student union. These gains
were made by the cooperation
and increased communication be-
tween students tSG) and ad-
ministration. The most impor-
tant victory last year was the
cooperation established between
(at all students, and (bi the stu-
dents’ representatives and the
administration.

4. Student Government has
lost sight of its major objective:
that is to raise the priority of
student affairs in all areas (not
only the union) in the overall
university planning organiza-
tions and structures. Comple-
mentary to this is the accelera-
tion of the trend of close coop-
eration between the students and
the administration. This was a
major contribution of the Man-
ning administration of last
year’ SG.

5. Student control in these
areas is not the objective. Stu-
dent Government will not ac-
complish either raising the prior-
ity of student affairs or coopera-
tion among students and admin-
istration by proposing or im-
plementing student takeovers in
any area of university life.

6. The welfare of the universi-
ty community to which the
whole of the student body be-
longs is the most important
thing to. remember. This should
never be omitted from policy on
any level. Students and adminis-
tration must work together to-
wards the end or suffer the con-
sequences as they are now do-
ing.

7. The confusion of issues in-
volved occur as a result of SG’s
not recognizing its major objec-

tives as stated in paragraph four.

SG has become bogged down in
details which it should delegate
to its newly created or already
existing committees. One such
committee exists in the Student
Union area.

a. The issue is lack of cooper-
ation between

(I) Student groups, and

(2) Students’ representatives
and university administration.

b. The issue is not (or should
not be) student control of Union
physical plant staff.

(c) The issue is no-t Student
Government control of Student
Union Board.

8. When the main issue is rec-
ognized and action taken on it,
problems of the nature of 7b and
7c will not arise.

9. Each area of student af-
fairs necds definition. A firm
structure must be established in
this whole area. This structure
must ensure cooperation and
must prevent one student area
from becoming so dominant as
to excluse the freedom to func-
ton of another area.

10. Speciﬁcally, the Union con-
cept is clearly not understood
by SG. This concept includes
methods established to adminis-
ter a union for the best inter-
est of all the students. The cur-
rent national trend is to make
the union a center for the whole
university community i.e. to in-
tegrate students, faculty, and ad-
ministration into a true univer-
sity community. A union should
not merely be office space (stu-
dent or staff) nor a living room
of the university. A union must
be a living thing; it acts like a
heart of the university.

11. Unwarranted charges
made against the union struc-
ture will only create misfeeling
and will certainly create an at-
mosphere in which constructive
action is hampered.

a. There is no erosion in SUB
Student interests are primary.
The SUB plans for the Whole
university community, not for
single parts. It is a service or-
ganization and therefore must
not be political. The accusation
shows that the accusers have no
knowledge of the Union concept
i.e. how unions operate in serv-‘

ice to the whole university com-
munity.

b. The change in name from
Pitt Student Union to Pitt Union
is not an example of erosion,
but of progressiveness. The for-
mer name tends to exclude other
groups, like graduate students,
faculty, staff, and administra-
tion from university community
functions. The later name seeks
to include these groups i.e. inte-
grate these groups with the stu-
dents. Otherwise a university
community will never exist at
Pitt.

c. There is student involve-
ment in union programming to
the highest degree. Advisors ad-
vise. Students program, not ad-
visors.

d. Physical plant management
is not a student function. Stu-
dent control of this area is im-
possible from any point of view.
Student consultation in this area
must be handled through coop-
eration with the staff and ad-
ministration according to objec-
t.~ves stated in paragraph four.

e. The accusation that SU or-
ganization is fuzzy is false. Ths
clearly shows a lack of investi-
gation on the part of the ac-
cuser. SUB is a viable, working
group made up of four chair-
men, each .in charge of four dis-
tinct areas. Each represents the

SUB in parts of the university
where their expertise is strong-
est. No one overall chairman
could be so effective because of
the amount of information in
each of the four areas. For this
reason an overall chairman plays
a disfunctional role. Decisions
are made by agreement of the
four chairmen.

12. I suggest that “Omnibus
Bill” is more ominous than om-
nibus. It attacked the SUB and
the staff when it should have at-
tacked the breakdown in com-
munications and cooperation with
the administration. This fault
is shared by both the students
and the administration.

13. As the problem developed
with both students and adminis-
tnation, it must be solved by
both groups Working together.

14. Student involvement is not
student control. The two must
be distinguii-shed at all times.
This llS a grave error on the stu-
dents’ part because it directs
their ~eft‘~orts towards the Wrong
ends. It is also a grave error on
the administrations’ part be-
cause it tends to cause the ad-
ministration to exclude the stu-
dent entirely from policy de-
cision when involvement of stu-
dents is so necessary in matters
concerning student affairs.

According to an independent survey (we took it

Creighton explained that only
l7-story towers have officially
been approved by GSA. But, at
the direction of the Building
Committee of the Board of Trus-
tees, the extra two ﬂoors have
been added to the plans. The
official decision of GSA on the
added ﬂoors is expected soon,
said Creighton.

Each ﬂoor above the ﬁrst will
have 23 student rooms, with two
students per room. The three
elevators in each ower will stop
on every ﬂoor, with two ﬂoors
(92 students) constituting a dor-
mitory house. Each house will
be equipped with its own laun-
dry, lounge, study room, typing
room, and vending machine bank.

A two-story high expanse of
glass in the lounge area of the
floors was added to tie the house
together ‘and add an aesthetic
touch, said Creighton. The outer
facing of the building will be
chosen to blend in with build-
ings on the lower campus —
the Cathedral, Hillman Library,
the Towers, and the Common
Facilities Building.

The Towers will be copies of
me another. They are L-shaped,
with the unbroken side facing
the lower campus. Residents on
the upper ﬂoors -of the dorms
will have one of the highest van-
tage points in the city.

The plans submitted to GSA
are labelld “University of Pitts-
burg Men’s Dormitories.” The
architects for the job, Deeter,
Ritchey, and Sippel pointed out
to students who during the sum-
mer conferred with the archi-
tects on the plans that there is
no structural reason why wom-
en could not be housed in one
of the Towers.

The University’s original state-
ment last November said that

 

only men would be housed at
the hilltop site. However, the
students who met with the ar-
chitects were men and women.
Ron Cowell, one of the students
noted that the discussion indi-
cated that both men and women
would be housed on the hill.
Other students in the group
were Senior Ruth Sklar, Aug-
ust Graduate Marsha Rehns, and
this reporter.

Cafeteria facilities will be lo-
cated on the ground floor of the
northern tower, closest to Veter-
ans Administration Hospital. The
cafeteria can be partially di-
vided into three sections by slid-
ing doors. The wall towards the
lower campus will be all glass.

On the roof of the cafeteria
will be an open terrace which
can be reached from the snack
bar or the central lobby, both
on the ﬁrst ﬂoor. This terrace
was also added by the Board
cf Trustees when it reviewed
the plans.

Most of the area of the ceme-
tary bought by the University
will be used for parking.

Artist Discusses
Art Education

Artist Adolph Gottlieb, speak-
mg informally last Monday in
the Henry Frick Fine Arts Build-
ing, claimed, “It is wrong to
learn through slides and repro-
ductions only. When actually
confronted with a painting, the
students don’t like the painting
as well as reproductions.”

G-ottlieb insisted that there is
no “earthy contact” with a-slide
as there is with the painting.
Slides and reproductions flatter
the paintings.

Go-ttlieb felt that the people
who are really interested should

go and see the paintings be- i

cause ‘‘it’s more practical to
transport people than paint-
irgs.”

Three of his works, “C-ounter-
point,” “Three Elements,” and
"Grey and Black,” were exhibit-
ed.

New Loan Program Faces Opposition

by WALTER GRANT

WASHINGTON (CPS)-
A recommendation that the
federal government estab-
lish a novel loan program to
help undergraduates pay
for their education faces
stiff opposition from two
powerful college associa-
tions.

If adopted, the plan, proposed
by a White House advisory pan-
el, could drastically alter the
present system of ﬁnancing
American higher education.

The proposal calls for the es-
tnblishment of an Educational
Opportunity Bank authorized to
borrow ‘money at going govern-
ment rates. The bank would
lend money to any undergrad-
uate colege or other post—sec-
ondary student for ﬁnancing his

cducation in return for an agree-
ment by the student to pay back
an small percentage of his an-
nual income for 30 or 40 years
after graduation.

Opponents of the loan pro-
gram say it would shift the ma-
jorresponsibility for support of
higher education to the students.

In addition to providing funds
for students to attend college,
the plan is designed to make it
easier for colleges and universi-
ties to raise their tuition and
other charges. With students
able to borrow all the money
they need for their education,
both public and private institu-
tions would no longer feel
obliged to keep prices as olw as
possible.

The Educational Opportunity
Bank was recommended by the
Panel on Educational Innova-
tion. The panel’s report was
made public Sept. 8 without en-
dorsement by the Office of Sci-
ence and Technology.

Shortly after the report was
released, a joint statement re-
jecting the recommendation was
released by the National Asso-
ciation of State Universities and
Land-Grant Colleges and the As-
sociation of State Colleges and
Universities. The two associa-
tions represent more than 300
institutions of higher education
enrolling more than half of all
US students. An official for the
American Association of Junior
Colleges also opposed the pro-
posal.

The panel which prepared the
proposal advises Harold Howe,
II, US Commissioner of Educa-
tion; Donald F. Hornig, special
assistant to the President for
science «and technology; and Le-
land J. Haworth, -director of the
National Science Foundation.

Following release of the re-
port, Dr. Hornig said, “While
we are not proposing establish-
ment of an Educational Oppor-
tunity Bank at this ‘time, we re-
gard the idea as an interesting
one, Worthy of serious consider-
ation by the country.”

However, Dr. Jerrold R. Zach-
arias, physicist at the Massa-
chusetts Institute of Technology
and chairman of the Panel on
Educational Innovation, said, “In
the opinion of the p-anel, it
should be pressed and pressed
to completion.”

Preliminary estimates indicate
the bank could be self-sustain
ing if it charged borrowers one
percent of their gross income

over 30 years for each $3,000
borrowed, thus, for example, a
student who borrowed $2,000 a
year for four years of college,
or a total of $8,000, and earned
$10,000 in some subsequent year
would pay $266 -that year, or
$22 a month.

The «report suggests the an-
nual payments be collected in
conjunction with the borrower’s
future income tax.

The panel said a borrower
would have the option at any
time of withdrawing from the
plan by paying, in a lump -sum,
the amount borrowed, plus in-
terest compounded at six per
cent, with credit for payments
made earlier.

An Educational Opportunity
Bank would “increase the extent
to which students can take re-
ponsibility for their own edu-
cation, «instead of depending on
a ‘free ride’ from either -their
parents or the government,” the
panel added.”

The bank also is designed to:

> Increase the number of col-
lege students from low-income
families.

>Help both public and pri-
vate institutions to improve the
quality of education by charg-
ing tu:i;ti.on closer to the full cost.

>Enab1e every student to go
to an institution suited to his
need and ability regardless of
his ﬁnancial situation.

> Provide relief to middle-in
com-e parents, many of Whom
ﬁnd they cannot in the face of
rising costs, give their children
freedom to attend whatever col-
lege they can qualify for.

Opposing the plan, Dr. Edgar
F. Shannon, .I,‘c., president of the
University of Virginia. and chair-
man of the executive committee
of the National Association of
State Universities and Land-
Grant Colleges, said, “Our fun-
damental concern is that this
proposal would shift the respon-
sibility of ﬁnancing higher edu-
cation to the student. Education
is essential for society’s own
self-interest and should be the
responsibility of society.”

The joint statement issued «by
the two major college associa-
tions called the panel recom-
mendation “a Pandora’s Box of
ill-considered, obsolete, and con-
tradictory ‘idevas . . .”

The statement continued, “It
is an ironic commentary on our
times that in this most affluent
nation in the world's history . . .
a panel should seriously take the

position that -our society cannot
afford to continue to ﬁnance the
education of its young people,
and must therefore ask the less
affluent to sign a life-indenture
in return for the privilege of
education-al opportunity.”

The Opportunity Ba.nk“would
on the one hand destroy the
whole concept of public higher
education,” the two associations
charged.

Dr. Shannon suggested that
the bank inrtroduce discrimina-
tion in education, because “the
rich would be to escape the plan,
while lower income students, es-
pecially with even higher tui-
t-ions, would be forced to accept
it.” x

Dr. Fred H. Harrington, pres-
ident of the University of Wis-
consin, said, “Right now a great
many people do not go to col-
lege because they do not want
to borrow money. This would
aggreviate this situation.” Dr.
Harrington added, “This propos-
al is a threat to a system of
higher education which has been
very successful.”

The two associations warned
that if the Opportunity Bank is
successful “in pushing up the al-
ready rising spiral of student
charges,” low and middle in-
come students will be forced to
borrow from it. Their statement
expressed fear that all of high-
er education will be dependent
on the ﬁnancial solvency of the
bank for its very continued exis-
tence.

The associations urged ex-
p a n d e d institutional support,
particularly unear-marked feder-
al grants, as the means -of re-
lieving the tightening college ﬁ-
nancial bind.

Awthors of the Opportunity
Bang proposal emphasized they
we-re not asking for a loan pro-
gram as such, but for “a device
for enabling students to sell par-
ticipation shares in the future
incomes. They said their plan
calls for “contingent-repayment
loans, as opposed to the present
programs, which they call “ﬁx-
ed-irevpnayment loans.”

The recommendation said the
bank would have three principal
advantages to the individual
over the present ﬁxed-repayment
programs.

First, no student borrower
would have to worry about a
large debt he could not repay.
If he entered a low-income call-
ing, or were unsuccessful in a
normally affluent one, his obli-
gation to the bank would de-
crease proportionately to his in-
come for that period.

Panthers Hope to Turn Tables on Illinois

by MIKE BROURMAN
A “Loyalty Day” crowd of better than 50,000 will be
on hand tomorrow in Champaigne as Illinois hosts the
Panthers at 2:30 p.m. (EDT). And for once Dave Hart
hopes that the Illini Athletic Department. has a crack in

TALK

by Jay Rosenstein
Sports Editor

  

THE TURNING POINT _ _ _

It’s just possible that tomorrow’s game with Illinois
will determine the success of the Panther season.

The situation is almost identical to the one that the
gridders faced at this time last year. They had been out-
classed by UCLA the week before, and were facing Duke
in the second game of the season. But a third down _punt,
run back for a Blue Devil touchdown, cost them the victory
that would have evened their record at 1-1.

Coach Dave Hart f'elt that a win over Duke at that
stage of the season would have meant a few rn_ore_ victor-
ies later. He feels the same way now. “The Illinois game
is our Duke game of last year,” he says.

 

 

IF THE‘ PANTHERS defeat the Illini tomorrow, it’s
a good bet that they’ll be able to handle West Virginia and

its crystal ball.

College football schedules are made out years in ad-
vance, at a time when the relative strength of the teams is
unknown. But, the ﬁve previous times Illinois has scheduled the
Panthers, they have picked years when the gridders have been

weak.

The_result has been ﬁve easy Illinois victories. Tomorrow, say
the oddsmakers, should be the sixth. The Illini have been establish-

ed as 17 point favorites.

But Hart, an unusually happy
coach after the UCLA loss, has
high hopes that the Panthers
can foil the touts and win their
ﬁrst game of the year.

He has been working his of-
fensive linemen overtime this
week in an effort to improve the
running game. He wants to -see
more holes opened up for the

Panthers vs. Illinois

against Illinois’ basic zone de-
fcnse, the Panthers will prob-
:-bly concentrate on this.‘
However, Illinois sometimes
goes to a man-to-man defense.
This is where Gustine’s aiidibles
become doubly important. If he
can spot the Illini in the man-to-
man, Gustine can throw the long
ball to either Bob Longo or Joe
McCain, either of whom Hart is
conﬁdent can beat their men.

On defense, the Panthers have
been stressing stopping the Illi-

record behind them, the Panthers can compete against
Navy, Syracuse, and Army. But they won’t be able to play
touch football against those schools if they come home at
0-4.

And contrary to the 17 point spread, the Panthers
can beat- Illinois. But in addition to ignoring a Loyalty
Day crowd decked out in orange and blue which will sup-
port the Illini‘, the Panthers will have to throw the foot-
ball.

ILLINOIS’ DEFENSE held Florida to 22 yards rush-
ing in the first half last week. The Illini like to physically
wear down their opponents and some say it was the heat
that prevented them from beating Florida last week.

Actually, i‘t was Illinois’ pass defense as much as
the heat. Florida_’s short passing game in the second half
riddled the Illini secondary. Scouting coach Stan Zapdel.
figures that the same strategy is ideal for the Panthers.

Hart is right to let his running game get established
before he lets Frank Gustine open up. But as Hart said
himself, Gustine grew up three games against UCLA.
Since now Gustine has the poise to complete first down
passes, it appears as if Illinois’ inexperienced secondary
could be given a real test by Panther receivers.

BOB LONGO needs only nine pass receptions to break
the Panther career mark of 78 set by Mickey Rosborough.
Hart has “all the praise in the world” for tight ends

. Frank Hartz and Rod Fedorchak, and wingback Joe Mc-

Cain. In addition, Hart feels that George Medich “must

allIllIHI1IIIlllllllI||I|IIHIIIIIIIIIIllIIIIHIIIIIIIIIIIIIHIIII:
runners. Along with this, he has
spent long hO'lllI‘S working on
the passing game to take ad-
vantage of Illinois’ inexperienced
secondary.

“Tuesday we had the longest
practice- since I’Ve been at Pitt,”
I-Iart disclose-d. “It wa:s neces-
sary because of the various de-
lenses that Illinois shows.

“These switching defenses ne-
ccssitate recognition, and with
our young linemen, we felt it
was necessary to work long to
familiarize them with that. At
the end of the practice we saw
sofe deﬁnite improvement.”

Illinois’ various defenses also
will necessitate the use of audi-
bles in some saituvationls. But Hart
isn't worried that his soph quar-
terback Frank Gustine «isn’t up
to the task. “Gustine grew u.p
three games against UCLA,”
Hart insists. “He called six or

holes by cutting back, away
from the motion of the play.
“We just lacked that one man
to ﬁll up that hole,” he noted.

Against Illinois
depends greatly on the option
play that was the backbone of
UCLA’s attack, Neal hopes that
the man will be there to stop
the play. “I thought our defense
was basically sound except for
that one play,” Neal said.

When the Illini do throw, it
mostly likely will be to splli-.t end
John Wright, a pre-season All-
America choice, an-d he can ex-
pect to «be double «teamed by the
Panther secondary.

Despite the fact that this has
been a jinx series for the Pan-
thers, Hart is conﬁdent that -the
Panthers can win. “We can beat
them,” the said cautiously. Per-
haps he is even more optimistic
than he is letting on.

Jeff Barr will be at tailback, enabling Mike Raklewicz
to have some daylight as the fullback.

pre-season polls, but we like the Panthers tomorrow.

Hart is also impressed by Gus-

Distancemen Host N.Y.
State College Tomorrow

Tomorrow morning at 11:30, the varsity and fresh-
men cross country teams open their home season at the
Schenley Park course when they host New York State Col-

lege at Buffalo.

‘Coach Jim Banner’s squads are both fit and ready for this encoun-
ter. As for their opponent, Banner knows very little about them.
“All that I know about them is that they are supposed to be one

of the stronger cross-country
teams in western New York
area,” he said. This is the ﬁrst
time that they have been on the
harriers schedule.

' Even though t.he Schenley
Park course has been described
as a rough one, Banner feels
that since the boys have been

c practicing on it, they are a.t a
slight advantage over the New
Yorkers. The varsity will run
over the fo-ur and one-quarter
mile course, while the freshmen
will compete over a shorter
three mile distance.

The varsity (1-1) hopes to re-
gain their winning ways once
again. They are led by Paul

about 75 per cent. of the game.”

Offensively, Lewis’ front line
\\ ill probably be Jerry Leary
(6-3, 205) and Bill Beinecki (6-4,
238) at tackles; Ed Sinesky (6-2,
2os> and Bob) Seltzer (6-1, 213»
at guards, and Ken Shumaker
(6-0, 203) at center.

The remainder of the starting
offense will most likely be Don
Plusquellic at quarterback; Bill
Pilconis, a 6-6 Pennsylvania low
hurdles champion and first team
all-star football selection at split
end; Bob Jouret, 6-5, 205, at tight
end; Mike Connell, who run.s the
hundred in 9.7, at tailback;iTony
lssposito at fullback; and John
Lewis, a Raleigh, N. C., recruit,
at wing back. Wingback Dave
Garnett, who runs the hundred
ir 9.5, may also break into Lew-
is starting eleven.

Defensively, Lewis plan to
start Bruce Harkiewicz (6-3, 215)

 

   

and John Stevens (6-3, 230) as
ends and Tom Porreca‘(6-3, 217)
and Howard Broadhead (6-5,
245) as tackles. That’s a front
four averaging 6-3, 227 pounds.

The linebacker corps could be
even stronger. Lloyd Weston,
Ralph Cindrich, and John Woz-
niak are all Pennsylvania Big
33 recruits.

Charlie Hall, Bill Ramos, Dave
Havern, and Bill Pietrantonio
make up the defensive backﬁeld.

There is no question that Lew-
is has a strong team. He has a
big defensive unit and a speedy
offensive unit to work with. The
only problem is time. Will they
be ready?

“Our kids have been spending
a great deal of time with the
varsity,” Lewis warns, “so I'm
not sure how well prepared
they’ll be. But they’re coming
along.”

A ﬁve-run fourth inning enabled
SAE to overtake a 7-5 deﬁcit.
Four more runs in the sixth inn-

Pi Kappa Alpha defeated
Lambda Sigma Rho, 6-3, after
taking an early 5-0 lead. Pi

Another early lead, 9-0, help-
ed Sigma Chi to a 10-7 win over

in leading his team to its vic-

red with three hits and great
clay in the ﬁeld.

Finally, Pi Lambda Phi, in a

Illini Possess Power

But Defense Doubtful

Illinois had a devil of a time with Florida. And Luci-
for himself was the only one missing from the Hell-like
100 plus degree setting as the Gators wilted the Illini 14-O.

In the unbearable heat, the Illinois defense, which had com-
pletely stymied Florida in the ﬁrst half, melted in the second to
allow the Gators two scores. And the Illini offense, which had dom-
inated the opening half, completely -dissolved and failed to penetrate

past the Gators’ 40 yard line.
It will be about 40° cooler to-
morrow in Champaign, and the
Panthers can expect a different
Illinois team than the one that

Wlllted last week. It’s “Loyalty,

Day” and the Illini will be try-
ing hard to convince the home-
town fans that they are a fac-
tor to be reckoned with in the
race fo-r the Big Ten title.
There was much controversy
about Illinois prior to this sea-
son, even more than is usual in
the always hectic Big Ten. Most

of it centered around the inn

famous “slush-fund” which was
uncovered there this spring.
Many people believed that the
disclosure of the illegal fund, the
ﬁring of coach Pete Elliot, and
the resulting NCAA bans would
crush the spirit of the F-ightin’
Illini. N 0 team, they argued, can

RICH JOHNSON
I llini Power Runner

withstand such abuse and still
come back with a good season.

Others disagreed. They ar-
gued that the loan would serve
only to strengthen the ﬁghting
spirit of the team. Under new
coach Jim Valek the Illini would
be out to prove some-thing to
the -rest of the country. And
besides, they noted, Wherever
there is a slush-fund you are
bound to ﬁnd some real horses;
some ﬁne football talent.

The Florida game, because of
the stiﬂing heat, failed to prove
the point either way. Therefore,
tomorrow's game may provide
the answer.

If the answer is affirmative;
if the Illini are indeed a power-
house, then much of the credit
will go to the offense. If the
answer is a negative one, then
much of the blame will lie with
the defense.

Offensively, Illinois revolve
around junior quarterback Bob
Naponic, a native of Hempﬁeld
Pa. “We’re going with Naponic

‘ all the way,” Valek has stated.

This is not surprising since last

year Naponic recorded the ﬁn-
est year ever by a soph quarter-
back at Illinois.

The sprint-out star completed
70 passes for 998 yards and ran
for 225 yards and six TD’s. Val-
ek calls him the logical succes-
nor to Bob Griese as the stand-
out qnarterback in the Big Ten.

Joining Naponic in the back-
field are Rick Johnson, a pow-
er runner who was the leading
ground-gainer last year; Carson
Brooks, a sturdy fullback who
excels -on up-the-middle smash-
es off the belly series; and ﬂeet
Dave Jackson, a soph who beat
out last year’s starter, Bill Hues-
ton, for -his spot.

Naponic’s primary receiver
will be John Wright, a potential
All-America selection who holds
all but two Illini pas-s-receiving
records. Last week Naponic
threw 17 passes, 15 of them at
V‘./‘right.

On the offensive line, both
tackles are veterans but the mid-
dle of the line is inexperienced.
Guards Doug Redmann and
Steve Oman are sophs, as is
center Bruce Erb, who is con-
sidered the best of the sophs.
But, the huge 250 pound tackles,
Bob Robertson and Willie Fields
should cover for some of the
soplrs mistakes.

The Illinois defense has size
and potential but lacks experi-
ence. It could prove vulnerable
if the Panthers are sharp.

The weakest spot is probably
the -secondary where there are
no veterans. Ronn Bess and Rick
Ericson, both of whom played
offense last year are the half-
backs, and Ken Kmiec, an All-
Big Ten choice at defensive end,
is now the safety. Florida’~s soph
quarterback Jack Eckdahl took
advantage of this inexeprience
last week and completed num-
erous passes.

The Illini are stronger else-
where. Tackle Tony Pleviak and
Fritz Harms are strong possi-
bilities for national honors and
should cover some of the mis-
takes made by their less experi-
enced mates. Both linebackers
are returning starters and a
third, Jeff Trigger, has been
moved to end.

Before Illinois met Florida,
Valek was worrying about the
high temperatures, and remin-
iscing about what happened to
Northwestern the year before.
“Northwestern went down then
when it was 102° last fall and
they really got a licking. In fact,
they suffered from it through
much of the season. That weath-
er took something out of them
and they never recovered.”
