Exam Ends

Freshman
Program

Men’s Council is winding up its

freshmen orientation program with,

the customary exam this Friday,
every hour from the first ‘to the
eighth, at 817 Cl. and 210 E. C.

Only the exam isn’t so customary.

Dozie Frazier, chairman of the
Customs Exams Committee, Ralph
E. Jenson, assistant professor of
Psychology, and some graduate stu-
dents in psychology, have produced
a 'new look’ in customs exams.

The test has a complete new
make- up and will be administered
contrary to precedent.

Instead of the objective-subjec-
tive make up of the past where the
student was required to do time-
consuming writing, a multiple choice’
system will be used. This new test
will also be machine scored, en-
abling Council to score the tests
within a much shorter period than
possible before.

The exam, according to E. J.
Mclntosh, assistant to the dean of
men and advisor to Men’s Council,
lwillinclude allphases ofthe fresh-
men customs and orientation pro-
gram-history of the University,
student activities, study habits,
and songs and cheers.

Men's Council and Ellsworth
Council will administer the test
and members of Alpha Phi Omega,
national honorary scouting frater-
nity, will proctor.

The freshman is to take the test
at the most convenient hour for him.
All freshmen are required to take
the exam. Special arrangements are
being made for those students whose
classes do not allow them to take
the test at any hour.

Dance to End

Grid Season

Brad Hunt and his orchestra will
move into the Schenley Ilotel on
Nov. 19 following the Penn State
g.ame to play for the Grand Finale.
The dance will add a final touch
to the last football game of the
year. '

Grand Finale tickets will be
$2.50 for dancing from 8:30 p.m.
till midnight. Both ballrooms in
the Hotel Schenley will be open
for the celebration.

Penn State as well as Pitt stu-
dents have been invited "to the
Grand Finale. Following the battle
on the football field in the after-
noon, one of the teams will be
celebrating a victory. The dance
will be geared for the commotion. ~-

In charge of the Grand Finale is
Chairman Marie Homisak. Business
manager is Earl Jacobs with Bill
Moltz handling publicity.

Scores Hit  

Pitt alumni made the most of their
Homecoming weekend this year.
Attendence was large at both the
Varsity Letter Club Dinner and the
Alumni Buffet Luncheon the next
morning.

The annual Letter Club Dinner
on Friday night gave Pitt’s sports-
men a chance to review old times.
Bill Sutherland and Woody Wolfe,
broadcasters for Pitt's games were
there, along with many outstanding
Pitt sportsmen of past years.

William Kern, chairman of the
Homecoming events, started this
year the pre-game Buffet Luncheon
for all alumni that is to be made an
annual event. The luncheon was a
sell-out two weeks before, and
about 600 alums met at the Hotel
Schenley before going on to the
Stadium.

Alum enthusiasm for the Panthers
was evident in the great crowd of
of fans that shivered through two
hours in the Stadium on Saturday.

An outstanding color spot on the
sidelinesgduring the game was the
E&M jalopy which drove especially
gentle, since it pulled a nesting
O-wl along behind it. Her proud mate
was beside her, dreaming perhaps
of next spring’s owlet. I

The only people who were really
warm during the afternoon were the
Panther in his furry suit and Drum
major Bill DeLuca,who in twirling
his flaming batons for the first time
this season, nearly burned himself.

With both the Ohio State and Pitt
bands striving to out do each other
at halftime, the music program was
one of the season's most outstand-
ing efforts. ‘

In spite of the game result, the
enthusiastic support of all Home-
coming events both by alums and
undergrads made the weekend one
of Pitt,’s most successful Home-
coming celebrations in years.

Cl ° d    
i By BILL SCRIVO 

The people who are responsible /
for Tuck Shop coffee got a chancel,
to give their side of therstory on 3‘
the eight cent brew situation early
Friday.  ’

In a small cement office with
green window drapes, Misses‘ Ruth
Cramblet and Savina Skewis not]
only defended their coffee to the ,
last drop but claimed that their food. ‘
was lower in price than other-res.-2
taurants. F ~ F P,

Miss Cramblet told this reporter.)
that the coffee sold in the Tuck?‘
shops and cafeteria is, a “special.
blend that is not sold to anyone
else.” The coffee is blended and‘
sold to the University Food Service
by a major coffee house. 

The answer to five cent \coffe.e J‘
is, in Miss Cramblet’s opinion,
"Raise the prices of sandwicheai.
tooffset the loss.” 1 I

She added that the Tuck Shop,’
policy is to“make every item carry 
itself.” . -  ’

This, she explained, is so that
students who buy only coffee will "
carry their share ofthe "burden along. y
with those who buy sandwiches.
and other items. ~ I ‘ t

"We work on the coffee situation g i
all the time,” said Miss Cramblet. F
“We are continually making tests,
by giving certain employees num-Q
bered cups of coffee and_ asking
them to chose the one they like",

‘Last Monday’s celebration of the sensational Penn victory
raised more rumpus on the eighth floor than it did in and around

Soldiers and Sailors Memorial. In Student Congress chambers that

. afternoon, the faction, in a minorityfthat has been plugging un-

successfully to record on paper its dissatisfaction with the Board

of Dean’s grant of a single definite one-hour class dismissal for

post-game festivities (used up that Monday), voiced its disgust
with the results _of the after-Penn get-together. ii -

Congress members also heard a complaint from several mem-

 bers of the band,‘ who had been threatened with cuts for missing

ii classes before and after the celebration, while they were drawing

and returning their instruments and marching to and from the hall.

Theodore W. Biddle, dean of men, heard complaints of a dif-
ferent nature -- from Carnegie Tech. Members of the Tech admini-
stration, not so athletic-conscious as the Pitt officials, had Dean
Biddle on the carpet, bewailing the disrupting invasion of their
campus by a few hundred Pitt men and women after the Memorial
rally broke up, hence, the open letter from Dean Biddle to Tech
President Robert Doherty published in Friday’s News.

Members of the unhappy Congress bloc drew a conclusion of
"not enough time” from the results of the celebration and renewed
their work toward getting more.

A That rally proved to us what we’ve been expecting all year
and what an anonymous Tech student unintentionally put into
words for us, “We're used to victories.” Despite the noise and
excitement, which actually were richly deserved by the football
team, we suspect the major motive in the minds of the most bois-
terous of the celebrants was freedom from classes.

No matter who you beat and how you beat them, winning is
bound to be taken as a matter of course eventually by the fol-
lowers.Unlike the before-and-after ads,in which the second panel
is the one that counts, we suggest that Congress concentrate its
efforts on the former and forget the latter. Admittedly,‘ what the
"more-time” faction is driving for is not so much longer cele-
brations this year, but establishing a precedent for future grid
season conduct.

If they will just recognize that it’s the winning habit that is
running the victory gatherings out of gas, they can gracefully drop
their campaigning on that score and throw their weight behind the
pre-game pep rallies, which, for our money and most assuredly for
the team and coaches’ money, have an infinitely greater morale
‘value to the squad, when it goes out on the field on Saturday
afternoons.

What good is a display of vigorous backing to the team after
it has pulled the tough upset.

The Ohio State rally drew close to a full house. The snappy
program was well-arranged and whipped up a fairly high pitch of
enthusiasm. But, with solid efforts behind their organization, and
appropriatestudnet enthusiasm, any charges of time-wasting will

A be nullified and Student Congress will receive the pat on the back

some of its members are so earnestly seeking.

Overset

By BILL scruvo

Pitt News News Editor

The most neglected spot on cam-
pus is Heinz Chapel. This outstand-
ing architectural achievement is
fast becoming just that and that
alone. It seems that the only people
who get anywhere near enthusiastic
about it. are out of town visitors
(some from as far as Arabia) and
sightseers.

It is no credit to Pitt students
when the highest attendance figure
for Wednesday chapel service is
74. An average of 20 people attend
the Thursday and Friday organ
recitals.

‘The services are open to all
students, are n\on—denominational
and feature a varied program of
speakers. Organ ‘recitals are given‘
by Dr. Frederick Lotz, and consist.
of classical and light classical‘
selections on one of the finest
organs in the world.

The situation is getting pretty
bad when interested students have
to chide their lax brethren, into
chapel attendance by picketing with
-,»"Students Unfair to Chapel”sigus
on their backs.

For the people who have been
to Heinz Chapel but never bothered
to go back, we say, “Go back,
you’ll find the atmosphere much
more invigorating than the Tuck
Shops.”

For those who have never been
(and there are many) "You don’t
know what you’re missing. And to
all the students -- Let’s make the
Chapel more than a magnificent
tomb, let’s appreciate the fine work
of the speakers, the hostesses and
Dr. Lotz. Let’s go to Chapel.

Philadelphia Stories

From his perch above Philadel-
phia's City Hall, William Penn must
have looked down with a disdainful
eye on the proceedings of one
Saturday night not long ago. Some
Pitt people who were staying at
the Bellevue-Stratford Hotel dropped

out of windows into an inside court.
Others imbibed much too freely
and were evidently not responsible
for their subsequent actions.
About the most disgusting thing
we’ve heard about the Philly week-
end was the "pantsless” party of
one of the Penn fraternities. The
uplifting influence of frat life, no

doubt.

The Red and Blue

Finally figured out why the Tuck
Shop charges eight cents for coffee.
They heard that there was going to
be a price raise shortage and want-
ed to beat everyone to the price
raise.

From .our Inquiring _Betty Mc-
Guire’sfindings it seems that prac-
tically no one likes TS coffee.
Feelers for a boycott of the stuff
have reached here.

Good idea. Any place that will
serve such a concoction needs
something. There is also evidence
that the ground floor joints have
charged for a cup of hot water.

One girl reported that she. was
forced to pay one cent for a cup
of ice water. When the clerking
crew found out there was real ice
in it, the price went up to five
cents.

Flower Show

Lots of orchids this week. One
to the band for its excellent half-
time show, one to the Pitt Players
for “Arsenic and--,” pne to_ the
team, and one to Dr. George Crouch,
the perpetual pallbearer. (He served
in that capacity twice in a week
while lecturing a class on guess
what -- the Graveyard poets).

The Faculty-Student B l e n n d
comes up tomorrow. In a school
the size of Pitt, it isn’t hard to
get to know the many interesting
people on the faculty. The Blennd
is the best idea we’ve heard yet
to accomplish this end.

Space Fillers

One of the older men around the
News office was talking to a soph-
isticated freshman girl. The girl
said to him “I'm kinda nave (naive),
but you older men are so blaze
(blase).

The efficacy of this one is rather
doubtful, but here it is. Upon hear-
ing that her instructor graded on
the curve, a freshwoman began

wearing sweaters to class.

Re !  S S   By BOB THOMAS

Unfair or true or not, the recent bad publicity surrounding the
Phi Kappa court suit has had a decidedly positive\affect on frat-
ernity—neighbor relations throughout the Pitt fraternity front.

With the decision on the Phi Kappa case buried deep in the

docket of judge A. Marshall Thompson in Common Pleas Court,
the frats are now lining up silently

The letter saidin part ‘We realize
that even the best of fraternities
cannot be the best of neighbors. . ’
and proceeded to request the recip-
ient to aid in the Theta Chi cam-
paign. So far there has been no un-

in a still-wavering but solidifying
line to pledge cooperation to the
neighbors who might live in their
immediate vicinity.

Spearheading this movement, a
comparatively recent one _at Pitt,
is the outer Bayard Street contin-
gent of Pitt fraternities Theta Chi
and Delta Tau Delta. Even though
it took a slight jolt to get the pro-
gram started, the cooperation pol-
icy is still a beginning, and athrust
in the right direction.

Several other frats contemplate
action along this line, among them
Sigma Alpha Epsilon. The SAE’s
have formed plans to get their im-
mediate neighbors together where
the frat members will be able
meet them.

According to IF Council presi-
dent Ray Maher, the Council has
obeen pushing a resolution to unite
the 20 members of the group in a
concerted drive to put frat-neighbor
relations on a more amicable plane.

Maher plans to appoint a separ-
ate committee to carry out this in-
clination at the next IF Council
meeting during the next two weeks.
Of course this idea can not be
pushed to extremes. We cannot
quite foresee a fraternity cowtow-
ing to its next door neighbor to the

favorable response. _
Tomorrow Delta Tau Delta is go-

ing together with Theta Chi in an
informal party for the severalneigh-
bors who are situated next to either
of the houses. The Delts are lo-
cated two doors up the road from
the Theta Chi house.

Mrs. Anna E. Campbell who re-
sides in the trap between the two
is one of the more enthusiastic ad-
vocates of the plan. Even after
twenty years on the spot she still
remains a friend to both.

Another course has been followed
by several other frats, that of re-
modeling their houses. An inci-
dental result of the improvements
has been the increasing of all the
-property values in the neighborhood.
Pi Lambda Phi leads here with a
$30,000 remodeling operation during
the summer. Pi Kappa Alpha and
Kappa Nu have had extensive out-
side improvements and Sigma Alpha
Mu plans improvements during the
semester.

MC ’s Football Movies
Attract SRO Crowds

A phenomenally large crowd thronged Stephen Foster Mem-
orial Hall last Thursday to see the Pitt-Penn game on Men's

Council sponsored films.

Fifth and sixth hours showed standing room only, with crowds
of 775 and 700 students respectively; and 350 students were pre-

sent during the seventh hour, mak-
ing a total of 1825 students to see
last Saturday’s thriller.

‘Frown this showing we feel that
our efforts haven’t been wasted,’
said Allan Goldberg, Council’s one
mancommittee in charge of the films.

Joe Perkovich, head football man-
ager, acted as narrator. Ile slowed
down the films to show certain
scenes over to point out his re-
marks.

Many of the exciting scenes,
such as Cecconi’s fifty yard run in
the last quarter, brought the crowd
in Stephen Foster to their feet
cheering.

This was a regular showingin
Men's Council's series of films of
Pitt's football contests. Every
Thursday there is a complete show-
ing of the previous Saturday’s game.
the fifth, sixth, and seventh hours
in Stephen Foster Memorial Hall.

When Council secured the athletic
department’s permission to use
these films, it was the first time
that the department had released
them before the season's end.

The series willcontinue until the
end of the present season.

Beaux Arts Day Programs to Miss Ditty, advisor to Women’s Speech.

Musicand allied arts will acquaint frosh women with the fine arts op-
portunities at Pitt.

Program

Schedules “A rt” Theme

"Women Through Art” will be the theme of this year’s Beaux
Arts Day program to be held at 3:30 p.m., Thursday, Nov. 10, in
the social room of Stephen Foster Memorial.

Beaux Arts Day is an annual program of speech and music
aimed at giving freshman women an opportunity to investigate the

i_University’s offerings in these
fields.

Under the sponsorship of the
\Xomen’s Speech Association, with
the assistance,of Women’s Choral,
this year’s program will consist
of poems and songs honoring women.

An hour-long presentation on
women who have done great deeds,
who have written poetry, and who
have inspired men to write, has
been set up by Esther Jacobson,
chairman of Beaux Arts.

An added attraction will be the
appearance of Mrs. Emilie Jacob-
son, noted lecturer and dramatic
reader. Mrs. Jacobson will read
excerpts from “Madame Curie” and
"Saint Joan.”

In former years, Beaux Arts con-
sisted of separate tours through
the fine arts departments of the
Cathedral, and ended with a tea
in the Commons Room. This year,

Lauds New
Med Center

Dr. Thomas Parran, dean of the
Pitt Graduate School of Public
Health, expressed the view that
his school and the proposed.Med-
ical Center "will excel most of
the great medical centers of the
country” at an address before the
Downtown YMCA Open Forum on
Nov. 3.

Speaking on "llealth in Pitts-
burgh,” Dr. Parran said that his
department will work closely with
the city of Pittsburgh, already a
leader in the field of public health.
He said, “The faculty represents

partment and some besides.”

He told his audience that right
now the state of Pennsylvania is
without an educational center in
the field of public health and that

on a national scale is being alle-
viated mainly by the University of
Michigan, Johns Hopkins, and Har-
vard.

According to Dr. Parran the Grad-

of graduate schools. He illustrated
how a normal graduate school takes
a student with a general education
and molds him into a specialist.

The School of Public Health ac-

broadening his education in the

Spearheaded_ by Joe Stuart and
Bob Wicks, the Professional Lea-
gue champs remained undefeated,
and by their victory moved into the
semi-finals. Their next opponents
will be named at a later date.

Wicks kept the Independents
busy with his hard running and
spirited defensive play. While Stu-

for three touchdowns and one extra
point.

Both teams battled evenly most
of the first quarter. Then, after
Bob Wicks intercepted a Cedar
pass, Stuart threw to Jocko Woods
for six points.

Early in the second period it was
Stuart again. This time he inter-
cepted a pass and raced 20 yards
for a score. Both extra points were
good, and at half time the score
was _14-0.

After two straight Big Ten losses, the Gophers got back into

the bowl race with a thumping 55-7

Double Win

Bimbo on Defense, Too

By MYRON KOP ELMAN

 llutside

About this time of year, when snowflakes are starting to fall, one’s
heart goes out to th-e cross country boys who are still running over hill

 

and dale in their underwear.

However, the heart is all that goes out to them, for the rest of the

body prefers the comfort of the In-

L doors.

Vthen a bunch of athletes cavort
or five miles in 30-degree
weather, wearing littlemore than

iundershirts and short pants, many

a layman attributes the feat to men-

,tal deficiency. But cross country

menicall it love of the sport.
Trouble is, not enough people
love the sport.

No Capacity Crowds

Certainly Pitt fans have never
been known to jam the Panther
llollow bridge in order to see Jay
IVeilson or Ted Zatkovich circle
the icy waters below. There is
nothing breathtaking about the
event except that it leaves the

runners winded.

This piece, it should be pointed
out, is not being'written on good
authority, for I admit to being just
lackadaisical enough to not want to
hustle out to watch the barriers in

 action.

However, I am told that on ex-
tremely cold days, they bundle up
by putting on T shirts under their
strapless d0—hickeys. In addition,
a sort of embalmingfluid is applied
to the limbs to keep them warm. I

, do not know whether a trainer or an

undertaker is employed in the pro-
cess.

At anyrate, when folks have al-
ready finished the leftovers from
their Thanksgiving turkey, Pitt’s
harriers will still be at it. The
squad has a Nov. 28 date up in
Lansing, Michigan, no less, where
the NCAA meet will be held.

Probably the motive is love of the

game. 'lhen again, maybe the boys

are just spurred on by their very
charming tutor, Carl Olson. ' ’

made choice food for tall-:. S0 in
the years to come, when Pitt's
present group of ball players get
together on Homecoming days, they
will doubtless do a lot of rehashing
on Saturday’s heartbreaker with
Ohio State.

With their ‘pot bellies protruding,
they will muse over what might
have happened if Jimmy Joe Kob-
inson could have played. On days -
when light-footed Jimmy was in
the lineup, they’ll recall, the op-
position frequently assigned at
least one special man to do nothing
but follow him.

Thus, even if Robinson had a
bad day, there were fewer men
chasing his partner, Bimbo Cec-
coni. So Bimbo often shook loose.

WHOA, TRIEICE
Halfback Jimmy Clark of Ohio State in Saturday’s game. The play was
an end sweep on which Clark got beyond the Pitt secondary. Bimbo,
who was a demon on offense all afternoon, proved that he was no slouch
on defense, either. In addition to making many tackles, he teamed up
with the other Pitt__backs to give the Panthers their best pass defense
of the season.

Lou “Bimbo” Cecconi moves in to bring down

Or perhaps the by-then ex-grid-
ders will stroke their bald heads
in despair and remember what might
have occurred if Carl l)ePasqua’s
fourth quarter punt had gone another
yard to the right and out of bounds
on the State'one.

And which team would have won
had Pitt made just one more yard
on only one of many fourth down
line plunges?

Yes, there will be no shortage of
conversational topics when the
classes of ’50, ’51, and '52 sit
down to the banquet table for Home-
coming. Unfortunately, that is about
the only consolation they will get
from the hard day's work which
yielded no payoff.

Sailors to Step

At Grid Game

An eight minute exhibition of
drilling will be put on at Saturday’s
Pitt-Minnesota game by the Pensa-
cola Navy Preflight drill team. The
navy men will perform at halftime.

The team consists of S7 sailors,
none of whom have had more than
three months of training. Yet they
have paraded at seven college games
this year. ‘Pensacola is known as
the “Annapolis of the Air.”

Buckeyes led, 26-0. With the rise of

to a mere 100.

i The final two Ohio State touch-
downs came on passes. Blubaugh
passed to Dale King, and Jim Slager
tossed to Jim McGuire for the last
six pointer.

Once again Arledge came through
with two more extra points, making
the final score read 40-0.

son’s touchdown pass to Skip Doyle

Early in the third period Pitt
changed from their usual single
wing offense to a winged T forma-
tion. '

Quarterback Bill Ewing, Guard
Gil Blicci, and Tackle George Fer-

sity next year. This trio has done
fine work all season.

Ultimatum Given IM Teams

For Tomorrow’s Hoop Talk

Intramural Director Leo Bemis has issued an ultimatum to each IM
basketball team to have four representatives present at tomorrow’s. clinic
at Pitt Stadium. Purpose of the session is to better acquaint intramural

teams with the rules of the game.

A. L. Walsh, a getired official,
will be the chief speaker at the
clinic. He will conduct play situ-
ations with the help of the Phi lips
and Psi Omegas, defending cham-
pions of the fraternity and indepen-
dent leagues, respectively.

Entry Deadline

The deadline for entering this
year’s intramural leagues is tomor-
row at 4:30, which is the starting
time for the clinic.

With the clinic plans completed,
Bemis is now moving ahead with
the formation of an athletic frater-
nity. The frat will be a chapter of

zation.

Pitt’s cross country squad had
bargain day in dual meets last
Saturday.

The records will list the Panthers
with dual meet victories over Ohio
State and Case on November _S, but
the physical accounts of the meets
will show the locals engaged in
only one meet.

Saturday’s meet,
scheduled as a dual match between
Case and Pitt, was later enlarged
by the entry of Ohio State. Case
and Ohio State's scores, however,
were not scored against each other,
as both schools were officially
only in competition with Pitt. The
Panthers, thus, ran only once but
were engaged in two dual meets.

Carl Olson's thinclads swamped
Case by a 15-49 score, but they
found the going tougher with State
as they won by only 23-37.

Ohio State’s Frank D'Arcy
claimed first place in the State-
Pitt scoring, while Frank Kuzma
of Pitt was first in the Case-Pitt
encounter. D’Arcy broked the tape
at 23:22.8, and Kuzma traveled the
4-mile course in 24:06.

Pitt swept first through seventh
places against Case, but dropped
first and fourth places to Ohio State.

A revision in the cross country
schedule has been announced. The
lC4A meet, scheduled for N0 v. 14,
was reset to Nov. 21. The NCAA at
East Lansing, Michigan, will be
held on Nov. 28. This Friday the
harriers will compete in the Senior
AMA-AAU meet at Schenley Park.
The Junior AMA-AAU meet will be
‘held Nov. 19.

‘Norway0ffers Courses

For Upperclassmen

Will you be at least a junior by next June? If so, you fill one
of the major qualifications on the University of Os1o’s educational

bill.

The Norwegian institution is throwing open its doors to A;neri-
can and Canadian students, above second year college level, in

its fourth special summer session,
scheduled to begin near the end of
June.

In case you do not know as much
about Norwegian as you do about
nuclear physics, university offi-
cials have arranged to have the
courses taught in English. In fact
an American clean is included on the
administrative staff.

Students enrolling may earn six
credits by taking the six weeks’
course. Whether or not they intend
to transfer credits, they will still
be. expected to complete the assign-
ments and take the examinations.
If they complete the courses satis-
factorily, the University of Oslo
will issue_them a certificate con-
firming this.

What will these students study?
The courses are divided into three
fields—— general survey of Norwegian
culture, the humanities, and social
studies. They will learn about Not-
wegian history, literature, arts and
the Norwegian language itself.Uni-
versity professors and government
representatives will enlighten them
on Norwegian politics and econonics

Fees and estimated expenses,
including tuition, will amount to
about $250. This figure does not
include round-trip fare to and from

' Norway.

Further information may be ob-
tained by writing to the Oslo summer
School Admissions Office, St. Olaf
College, Notthfield, Minnesota.

Tuck Shop
Coffee Aired

(Cont. from Page 1)

Miss Cramblet was backed on
this statement by Horace Kuhl, a
chef who once cooked for Presi-
dent Grover Cleveland. He claimed
that "We’re buying the best coffee
we‘ can and I think the price is
very reasonable.” Asked if he
liked Tuck Shop coffee Chef Kuhl
replied, "very much so.”

Kuhl is one of the employees who
doubles as a coffee tester.

One of the ways by which the
Tuck Shop heads can tell if their
coffee is going over is the amount
of coffee left in cups. According
to Miss Cramblet there is very little
coffee "coming back undrunk.”

Tuck Shop coffee should not be
compared with home coffee accord-
ing to Miss Skewis. "At home,”
she said, “most people eat a meal
with their coffee. Here they just
have a cup of coffee.”

The Food Service heads also
brought out the point that their
sandwiches are the cheapest in
town. “Where else,” Miss Cramblet
asked, "can you get a ham sand-

wich with lettuce, pickles, and
mayonnaise or mustard for 25
cents?”

She also requested that if stu-
dents have any complaints, they
bring them to her or Miss SkeW1s-

Legal Frat Forum

The first forum of the John Mar-
shall lionorary Pre-legal Fraternity
will be held tomorrow at 2:30 p.m.
in room 244 CI. W. Edward Sell,
assistant professor of law of the
university law school will speak
on the topic, “A Look into Law
School and Legal Education” His
speech will cover the preparation,
the curricular and extra—curricular
activities during law school and
will include the prospects there-
after. 7

Hold Kaper

Coeds will et a chance to ca-
vort at the 7' iddies Kaper,’ an
annual event sponsored by the
junior women.

According to Chairman Grace

Saltzman, the party is held for their
freshmen sisters. The party will
get under way on Tuesday, Nov. 8,
from 3:30 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. The
coeds have chosen the twelfth floor
to stage their rumpus on.

In keeping with the ‘Kiddie’ motif,
pink hair-ribboned frosh will play
children games, and will be served
appropriate refreshments by baby-
blue clad junior women.

Another novel twist to the ‘Kaper’
is the admission fee. Each girl will
be required to bring two pins and
one button for admission to the af-
fair. This is one affair where the
girls can be pinned down or button-
holed.

The affair is designed to bring
the coeds together in order that
the freshman girls can become ac-
quainted with their upperclass
sisters.
