Students applaud Hand-in-Hand

By Laurie Lehosky
Staff Writer

Pitt students gave a lot of love
to the children who attended
the 12th annual Hand.-in-Hand
festival this past Saturday.

The festival took place in the
lower level of Forbes
Quadrangle, where a carnival
atmosphere was created by
bright banners, balloons and
bubbly, happy-faced clowns.

The theme “Put a Little Love I I

in Your Heart” was incorporated
throughout the day by the
volunteer students who made
the day an unforgettable one for
250 mentally and physically

handicapped children. Each
child was paired with a one-
on-one student volunteer. The
one-on-one volunteer and the
child shared the day together
by participating in the fun,
games and entertainment.

“I wanted to spend time with
a child. I thought, ‘What a
great stress reliever two weeks
before finals,” said senior
Sandra Perez.

Perez, who is majoring in
biology, and history and
philosophy of science, said
she called the day before the
festival to see if the staff needed
volunteers, and they did.
Initially, Perez signed up to be

by the Supreme Court, prohibits
enlistment and commissioning of
homosexuals and is thereby
inconsistent with university
policy, it is nevertheless beyond
the control of the university.”
Posvar emphasized that only
staff, faculty and employees of
the university are required to
follow the anti-discrimination
policy; however, in the ROTC
contract with the university, which
was signed in 1965, it states that
“the authorities of this institution
understand that the law requires
that no unit may be established

or maintained at an institution
unless the senior commissioned

officer assigned to the institution -

is given the rank of professor.”
According to Posvar, the
officers of the ROTC have adjunct
status with the Army and the
university and are given the title
of professor of military science
only as an honorary title.
“[Professor of military science] is
a term used very loosely.
[Professors of military science]

are not employees of the
University of Pittsburgh.”

Heart clinic provides
advanced treatment

By Lisa Pugliese
Staff Writer"

The recently publicized
University of Pittsburgh Heart
Institute is in full swing,
combining clinical care with
advanced scientific techniques
in order to further the research
and treatment of heart disease.

The institute will house its
administrative offices in
Montefiore Hospital. Clinical

work will be conducted at,

Presbyterian-University-Hospital
and Montefiore Hospital. P

‘Hired last July during the
creation of the Pitt Heart Institute,
Dr. Bruce Wilson, former head of
acute cardiac care at the

_ University of Minnesota Hospital,

has been named director.
Wilson, in conjunction with a
staff of 20 to 25 cardiologists and
11 cardiovascular surgeons, will
combine efforts at the Institute.
“[The University of Pittsburgh

Heart Institute] is a multi-
disciplinary institute, utilizing the
talents of many to better
understand, treat and prevent
development of heart disease [in
the patientsl,” said Wilson.

“It will involve a wide variety
of cardiac research,” he added.

The Institute grew out of an

awareness that the university

needed to “build up its patient
base and supplement research.”

Dr. Mohammad Shenasa was
brought to Pittsburgh injuly from
the University of Montreal to
spearhead the lnstitute’s work
concerning cardiac arrhythmia.

Cardiac arrhythmia (another
name for an irregular heartbeat)
kills approximately one-half of
patients diagnosed with heart
disease each year, according to
Wilson.

exciting,” said Wilson. “His area

of interest lies in arrhythmias

Symposium continues
struggle against racism

By Jeff Tatusko
Staff Writer

Several local and campus leaders challenged Pitt students to get
involved in the fight against racism at a symposium held Sunday in

the William Pitt Union Ballroom.

Matt Sipple, president and founder of Students Against Racism, said
that the purpose of the symposium was to “educate people about

racism.”

“We really need to promote discussion about racism,” he said.

Luigi Giovine, chairman of the event, agreed. “We have to [give
people] an idea of how the problem is felt in order to create a
dialogue,” he said. “Hopefully, we can expand the discussion into the

community. ”

The program, which was co—sponsored by StAR and the black-
studies department, featured speakers from both campus groups and

area organizations.

Sipple started the program with a call for people to fight their
prejudices. “We need to combat bigotry and racism as a whole,” he

said.

Doug Ligons, chairman of the Black Action Society, agreed with
Sipple but went on to say that “the ﬁght against racism is not a
temporary thing; it is a lifetime thing,” he said. He then challenged
the audience to get involved in the struggle against racism and to put

Conference sets tone for Earth Day

By Gretchen Haller
For The Pitt News

The world is going to hell in a
handbag, but everyone can do
something to make it better.

That was the message delivered
at last week’s sold-out “Solving
Today ’s Environmental Problems”
Conference (also called the STEP-
One Conference), which was held
in Pittsburgh. The conference set
the tone for worldwide
environmental— awareness
activism on Earth Day, April 22.

Key speaker Peter, H.
Raven, Ph.D, director of
the Missouri Botanical
Garden, spoke on the
problems of
overpopulation,
undervalued primary

ST

 

government offices, corporations
and foundations.

Problems discussed at the
conference included: global
warming, overpopulation, A air
pollution, recycling, pesticides
and deforestation.

Needleman called lead
poisoning ‘a disease of lifestyle”
that causes permanent problems
ranging from lowered IQ scores
to criminality. He also said that
low—dose lead poisoning “is a
product of our conscious choice
of how we spend our money and

EP 

children have neuro-toxic levels
of lead in their blood,” but
exposure to lead “truncates 5
percent of [other] children
because it prevents them from
achieving truly - superior
development, which is a social
disaster.” ,

“That’s 17 percent‘ of all
American children, rich or poor,
who have excess levels of lead in
their blood,” Needleman said.

Effects of lead poisoning “are
spread not just in IQ scores but in
real life — how much money this

child is going to earn

[or] where he will be

placed in society,” he
added.

The seriousness

of lead poisoning has

“According to
UNICEF, ” Raven said, “100 million
people in the world are homeless,
and 35,000 babies under the age

starvation.

“We know more about the
surface of the moon than we do
about the tropical forests of the
world, upon which a majority of
human beings depend for their
livelihood-, and to judge by our
actions, we really don’t care. We
care a whole lot about the moon.”

Urging the Conference
attendees to let Congress know
their priorities, Raven said,
“People have to hear that people
care.”

Dr. Herbert L. Needleman,
professor of psychiatry and
pediatrics at the University of
Pittsburgh School of Medicine,
joined nine other noted
environmentalists, including Paul
and Anne Ehrlich of Stanford
University and George Woodwell,
director of Woods Hole Research
Center, in addressing 1,200
participants from local and
national garden clubs,
universities, civic and
environmental groups,

energy.”

After noting that the United
States did not pass a law to restrict
lead use in paint until the '70s, 50
years after a similar law was
passed in Australia, Needleman
discussed his 11-year follow~up
report on young children,
published in the January 1990,
NewEngland]oumalofMedicz'ne.
The study shows that exposure
to lead during childhood is
associated with central nervous
system dysfunctioning that
persists into young adulthood.

‘‘I decided it was reasonable to
begin to test whether large
[quantities] of lead [exposure]
make you retarded, [and] small
[quantities] make you stupid,” said
Needleman.

Needleman and his associates
showed that lead exposure is not
a problem for poor children alone,
but is primarily found in areas
where atmospheric and
environmental lead are located,
there is a shortage of jobs, and
houses are in disrepair.

“As much as 20 percent of
delinquent behavior is [lead-
relatedl,” he believes. Not only
do “half of [all] poor, black

of the poor. Removing

it from gasoline, water and
housing costs money, and vested
interests such as the lead industry
and fuel-additive companies work
to obscure the effects of low-
dose lead. And as a low-
technology disease, “It does not
enjoy the cachet of lasers,
molecular biology or liver
transplants.” ,.
Needleman suggested that one
simple solution wouldbe to train
unemployed people who live in
high lead—exposure areas for safe
de-leading and housing
rehabilitation and to pay them a
living wage. This would reduce
unemployment and make more
decent dwellings available and

reduce children’s exposure to

lead.

While conceding that this might
seem like a utopian fantasy,
Needleman compared the $10-
billion cost of such a project to
the $30,000 cost of constructing
one new prison bed and the
$20,000 to $30,000 cost per year
of maintaining one prison inmate.

Quoting the man in the oil- filter

ad, Needleman said, “You can .

pay now or pay later.”

ROTC

Continued from page 1

Posvar also said that the
university is “unable legally”
to do anything about the ROTC
situation. The ROTC contract,
though, states that “this
agreement may be terminated
by either party upon giving
one academic year's notice of
such intent by either party
hereto.” e

As far as the use of university
property by the ROTC is
concerned, Posvar said that
the university does not provide
financial support to the
program.

“ROTC brings many
resources , and provides
scholarships and support [for]
our students, and they provide
a lot of teaching services in
excess of the cost to the

university. In terms of cost, I
think that we benefit from the
ROTC.  In net gain [Pitt
makes money from ROTC.l”
Posvar, who went to both
West Point and the Air Force
military academies, believes
that removing the ROTC from
campus would be immoral.

“I think that you are trying
to inflict punishment, unjustly,
immorally and unfairly on
people with whom you
happen to disagree over a
matter over which they have
no control. Think about it.
You are wrong. You want to

— punish innocent people. You
want to punish ROTC staff A

and students who had nothing
to do with this policy by
kicking them off campus.”

Teaching while Eastern Europe bursts its bonds has been a
once-in-a-lifetime experience for many college faculty members,
affecting everything from book orders and class notes to egos
and wardrobe.

“It’s quite humbling,” said Wayne Moyer, political science
and international relations specialist at Grinnell College in
Iowa. “We know a lot less than we thought, and we are less
conﬁdent. It’s exciting.”

The Berlin Wall went up as Moyer was finishing college; it

'2 tumbled as he was winding up his fall seminar on American

foreign policy.

“The magnitude of what has taken place makes anything else
seem miniscule by comparison,” he said. “What’s good today
is wrong tomorrow. Scholars are pretty good at explaining
stability, but not so good at explaining change.”

“Scholarship is usually ‘Monday morning quarterbacking,”’
noted Boston University’s government professor Andrei

Markovits, an expert on Eastern Europe and Germany, “but this i

ain’t scholarship. This is the game as it happens; you’re living
it, and it’s emotional in a way most of us haven’t dealt with in

their efforts into advancing that
struggle.

Nathan Urban from the Student
Honors Advisory Cabinet told
students that they should question
their peers on the subject
“Question your professors and
the administration about racism
and sexism. We must take back

‘V our university. [Racism] cannot

continue in our society,” he said.
After the students had made
statements for their respective
organizations, several speakers
were called on to make some
remarks.
Tamara Horowitz, a professor

from the philosophy department,
gave several reasons why many
people in society feel racism is
actually helpful in this country.
“Racism creates a low-level
working class for people to take
jobs at ridiculously low wages,”
she said. “Secondly, it distracts
attention from the level of poverty
in this country. Finally, it [prevents]
the working classes from
organizing as one."

Horowitz also criticized the
university for not doing enough
to fight racism.

“The university does not go out
of its way to hire non-racist
professors. That decision is_ left

“The kids need this attention
and time. They need the positive
reinforcement to know that their
abilities to play games are fine.”
She added, “It is an exhausting
experience, but it is also fun kid
stuff. I would‘ definitely do it
again.”

Senior staff member Lara Evans
agreed it is well worth the time.

“When the kids arrive, they are
ready to leave their mothers. It is
a really rewarding experience,”
said Evans, a senior elementary-
education major.

Evans encourages more people
to get involved in next year’s
program, which begins during
the beginning of the fall term.

.3;

Evans pointed out not to put
stress on the word handicap. She
said the children's handicaps
ranged from learning disorders
to seizure disorders.

“Don’t fear them. Kids are kids,”
said Evans.

In the eyes of the children and
those who participated in the
festival, Saturday was a special
day.

“Everything ran extremely

smooth. We had just enough
volunteers. I am very pleased
with everything and the way my
senior staff came through,” Gatto
added. “Parents thought this was
an incredible event, and the kids
enjoyed it.”

solely to the department
chairperson. Also, Pitt allows the
fraternity system on campus to
be segregated,” she said.

Barbara Wolvovitz, a
representative from the American
Civil Liberties Union and a former
civil- rights attorney, blamed the
Reagan administration for
promoting racism. “There has
been no progress in the fight
against racism,” she said. “[Racism]
is still [residual] in society. This is
a result of the Reagan
administration saying that racism
is OK today.”

Wolvovitz also said that the
Supreme Court has been turning
away from anti-discrimination in
recent cases brought before it.

Women for Racial and
Economic Equality member Lois

McClendon said that racism and
sexism are inherited in society
today, and that many people feel
that women and blacks instigate
violence against themselves.

“The first question that is asked
in domestic violence is ‘What did
the woman or person of color do
to instigate this?’" she said.

Gail Austin from the University
Challenge for Excellence Program
challenged students to criticize
government priority in__ spending.
“Students should get involved,”
she said. “Tell the government
that [it] should be spending less
on defense and more on
education.

“Be vigilant. There should be
enough financial aid for all
students," she said.

participated in a November faculty
panel on the fall of the Berlin
Wall. “Students got to see with
their own eyes that many of their
teachers couldn’t agree yet on
these matters.”

Last term Patch taught a course
in German history from 1866 to
1955. He observed that the novel
that students were required to
read couldn’t have been a better
choice. At term’s end the class
was studying the partition of

A Germany and reading “The Tin

Drum,” by Gunter Grass, whom
"Patch called the foremost pacifist
in Germany today. “And that
novel's warning against German
nationalism or reunification was
most helpful to us," he said.

l/iewing an‘ in Cincinnati

The latest exhibition featuring the art of Robert Mapple-
thorpe has rolled into Cincinnati. Mapplethorpe is famous
for his many very talented, artistic works and his use of

’ colors, but he is also known for some very graphic works

which have been described as “sadomasochistic and
homoerotic.” >

Last year, Mapplethorpe’s works ignited a furor in the
U.S. Senate over whether or not the federal government

, should fund the arts, namely those considered “obscene.”

However, the current opposition in Cincinnati does not
concern the issue of government funding of the arts but
rather the displaying of Mapplethorpe’s-works.
Opponents of the Mapplethorpe exhibition have rallied
to prevent its opening this week, at Cincinnati’s Contem-
porary Art Center. This particular exhibit contains“ pictures

A j of calla lilies and celebrities along with photographs of

homosexual acts and nude or nearly nude children. City
grand jurors anonymously joined the public to view the
exhibition on Saturday morning. Within hours of viewing
the 175 photographs, they decided that seven of them

. were obscene.

However, a U.S. district judge barred Cincinnati law-

enforcement officials on Sunday from interfering with or
closing the exhibit. The judgesaid that the authorities
“may not remove the photographs or close the exhibit or
take action intimidating in nature to prevent the public
forum from seeing the exhibit.” Th. injunction will
protect the exhibition while the case gc as to trial.
4“ Now, one might understand why the Cincinnati viewers
would not want to have the Mapplethorpe exhibit in one
of their local art galleries, especially since the art center
is open to the public. -However, the exhibition was
confined to viewers over the age of 18.

We must applaud the U.S. district judge for upholding
the First Amendment of the Constitution, regardless of the
subjective morality of city officials. To deny the viewing
of an art exhibit based upon what may be deemed
offensive is exactly what the amendment . protects against.

Citizens for Community Values (one organization against
the exhibit) spokesman Phil Burress said the group was

“going to trust the system.” Thankfully, the system didn’t .
trust the closed-rninded opinions of an unenlightened

few.

Even though Mr. Paul Kengor
seems to believe that one must
have a degree in a particular area
before one can actively partici-
pate in that area-, we have ac-
cepted his work at The Pitt News
for some time, even though he
lacks a journalism degree. We
haven’t labeled him a “news
freak.” However, his April 4 ar-
ticle has forced us to speak out.
By Mr. Kengor’s standards, we
are not environmentalists, but
we feel compelled to expose
some facts that he conveniently
disregarded; True, the emissions
of fission reactors are, on the
average, cleaner than those of
oil- and coal- fired furnaces.
However, smog and fumes seem
tame when compared to the
radioactive waste produced by
modern fission plants. Plutonium,
a byproduct of fission, is possibly
the deadliest substance known
to man. A single gram in the local
water supply could kill off the
entire population of New York
City. Plutonium has a half-life of
500,000 years, far longer than
recorded history. Scrubbers and
gas cleaners can be installed on
coal- and oil-fired furnaces with
the penalty being higher costs,
but nuclear-fission reactors can-
not help producing plutonium
and other deadly elements. As of
today, we know of no _safe-place
to store these perpetual threats to
the environment. In addition,
uranium 235, the fuel for ﬁssion
reactors, is scarce, with exploit-
able reserves expected to last
only 25 years at today’s slow
consumption rate. Even the rich-
est of deposits is difficult, expen-
sive and dangerous to process, as
fissible uranium atoms occur in a
ratio of 1:141 with other useless
uranium isotopes. It seems that
fission is hardly the long—range
solution and probably will not
even serve as a stopgap. We
believe that the answer is cleaner,
more efficient use of our fossil-
fuel reserves and hydroelectric
power sources, while the tech-
nology for “clean” energy ma-
tures. Solar, geothermal and that
brass ring, nuclear fusion, are all
in this category. Label us “baseline
demagogues” if you wish, but at

least we base our opinions in
fact. 0 “

Congratulations to your per-
spective editor Paul Kengor for
his perspective editorial on Wed.
April 4, 1990, entitled “An Envi-
ronmental Conservativism: Part
I.” I could not wait to read his Part
11 before dashing off this letter in
fear that with the end of the

 

. semester approaching letters may

miss out [on] your proper atten-
tion if they are too late. I support
very much the down-to-earth
viewpoint [that] “The end result
of the efforts of the ‘No Nukes’
crowd is an unnecessary U.S.
reliance on inefficient means of

energy, of which the “reliance

breeds not only tax increases,
higher military costs and risks (in
protecting the Middle East oil
which we require), oil and en-
ergy crises, Exxon Valdez and
other oil spills ...”Did [we not just
have] one over the Allegheny
River that passed our city?

I hope this editorial will gener-
ate more discussions on such
important issues on our campus,
which leads me to suggest  The
Pitt News do some survey on
public opinions concerning some

burning issues like the recently

passed (in the Senate) Clean Air
Act, the environmental move-
ment, No Nukes movement, etc.
As a background, [I'd] like to
bring up some polls reported a

year ago in the Nuclear News

(March 1989 issue) by the Ameri-
can Nuclear Society: (one of three
reported with similar results).
The Gallup Organization con-
tacted 1,000 adults in the United
States and found [that] 79 percent
said that nuclear power will be
important in meeting future elec-
tricity needs, and 76 percent said

Mixed emotions, on the environment  

that it is likely that new nuclear
plants will have to be built.
Wouldn't it<be interesting to
take a similar poll among the
readers of 7l2ePitt News on issues
mentioned above by using a small
part of the newspaper for ballot-
ing? Would the perspective edi-

A tor be interested to see the amount
of response as well as the opin-

ion represented by them?

Y.S. Tang
Faculty member, mechanical-
engineering department

When I read the ﬁrst sentence
of Paul Kengor’s April 4 column,
[...], I thought I was finally going

' to hear a conservative voice sup-

port for environmentalism. But
as I read on, I discovered that the
column was just another exercise
in baseless, narrow-minded ra-
tionalization on the subject by
the right.

Whatfbothered me the most
about Mr. Kengor’s approach
toward environmentalists or
“environmental freaks,” as he calls
them, was his narrow definition
of the word “environmentalist.”
Why does he limit the use of
“environmentalist” to .“someone
who has the proper training in an
ecology-related area?” Shouldn't
having a concern for the world

‘ that we all live in allow us all to

be environmentalists? It doesn’t
take an advanced degree to real-
ize that we are facing grave prob-
lems with our environment.

And who is Mr. Kengor to tell
any person, whether qualified by
“his definition” or not, that they
are not qualified to protest? Since
when does a person have to hold
a Ph.D. to exercise his constitu-
tional right to protest? Mr. Kengor
does not have an advanced de-
gree in journalism, nor has he
had his columns appear in the

New York Times or the National .

Review, but I would not call him
a “freak columnist” or a “right-
wing nut.” Furthermore, I would
not question his qualifications to
write or protest ‘my point of view.

Sending an overdue salute to the people in gray

“A human touch can have no
equal. ”— Basia

‘Damn, dude, this place looles
liIeebell"— astudenttobisfriend

‘ last weekend

The gardener can be soothed
by the morning dew on his freshly
cut grass and seize the moment
of harmony as his. The maid can
polish a set of jewels to sparkling
perfection and admire‘ their
beauty as hers to revel in. The
window cleaner can look through
his spotless expanse of glass and
consume the world view as if it
were unfolding from a vantage
point that was his exclusively. A
car washer can run his hands
over the most expensive cars in
the world and achieve some-
thing of a personal communion
with their power and man-made
glory. And the university's ﬁne
janitors can keep this school clean
and consider the wisdom and
fortitude of over 200 years of Pitt
history as theirs to be claimed as
personal responsibility.

In our consumer-oriented
society, there is far too often a
concentration on the technical
issues of ownership and material
ambition. We tend to ignore those
who live by work that is geared
toward preservation, and we even
tend to look down upon those

Statehood for the District of

An appeal was just made to the
United Nations to help a region
populated mostly by “oppressed” I
blacks gain political autonomy
from the white-controlled gov-
ernment The leading political
ﬁgure of this region decries the
purported oppression of the area,
and many hope that someday,
when true \ independence is
achieved, that he will be among
the top leaders in the new gov-
ernment Yes, it is possible that
one day Jesse Jackson could be
the first senator for the new state
of Columbia.

Last week, this announcement
by the Rev. Jackson added a new
twist to the boring old arguments
advocating statehood for the
District of Columbia. Supposedly,
the United Nations would have
to interfere to liberate the citizens
of Washington from a system
he’s comparing to apartheid. No
matter how legitimate the Rev.
Jackson’s grievances are, grant-

who provide a smooth path for
the “upwardly mobile” to ascend
upon. This writer says that it is
high time we show more respect
and gratitude for those the uni-
versity employs to clean up after
us and make the world less ﬁlthy.

In Lothrop Hall, a clever man
by the name of “Cal” roams the
hallways with a station of cleans-
ers and buckets; he retreats with
regularity to a locked closet to
obtain brooms and mops. He
served our country as a Green

» Beret and has scored numerous

victories for troubled youth. As a
basketball coach, he trained,
educated, led and housed scores
of teenagers. He preserved our
country and youth from the perils
of penetrating ﬁlth. Now he cleans
our dorms.

“Annie” makes sure the sun
comes up in the mornings with
her ceaseless charm, even on
days when the weather seems
gray and dark. The happiness
that she projects often impresses
me, if only because the notion of

_ her job is so unappealing to most.

We generally don’t like to (and
often just plain don’t) clean up
after ourselves, so to say that
most enjoy cleaning up after
others would be absurd.

This writer feels sure that nei-
ther “Cal” nor “Annie” would be
comfortable if public homage was

ing Washington, D.C. state status
is by no means a viable solution.

President George Washington
wanted the seat of the federal
government moved to a district
totally separate from the states to
prevent any one state from ex-
erting too much inﬂuence on the
workings of the federal govern-
ment. While this danger is largely
gone, it is still a great beneﬁt that
the capital is considered repre-
sentative of the entire United
States, and every citizen can feel
that he is a citizen of Washing-
ton. Statehood for the region
would weaken this very per-
sonal identiﬁcation most of us
have with our capital and, by
extension, with our government.

Most people in this country
would live with this consequence,
though, if it could be demon-
strated that the benefits of state-
hood for the citizens of the Dis-
trict of Columbia would outweigh
it. It is impossible to see, though,

paid to them, but it is certainly a
topic that deserves exposure.
What my two favorite janitors do,

along with the hundreds of other
janitors here at the university, is
wonderfully nice.

We are able to look at a crazy
world with an academic distance
only when our own is personally
clean and ordered. And that is as
much a remark that refers, to the
physical dirt as it does to emo-
tional and spiritual burden. After
all, as any computer whiz could
reaffirm, even the most high-tech
computers need to be plugged in
to a simple electrical socket in
order to work. And on a less
theoretical level,“ it is certainly a
difﬁcult task to be at mental ease
while sitting on a commode that
appears to have been used by

how it would be. The many ills of
the city of Washington (crime,
dnig abuse, poverty, lack of
housing and a world of others)
have no quick solution, which is
what many envision statehood to
be. It has even been suggested
that should statehood ever be

achieved, federal aid to the area
would steeply decline, as the
government regards the district

 

elephants as a result of a drunken
“fun time” had by a band of
delinquent “carnies.” ,
And budding scholars“ at this or
any university can and do be-
have as drunken carnies might.
Graffiti licks freshly scrubbed
elevators. Vacuumed carpets are
utilized as race courses for
mountain bikes and their skid-
ding and staining. Walls are splat-
tered with urine, and unfortu-
nate door stops are decorated
with fecal matter. Vomit scents
the air on weekends, replacing
the aroma of Clorox. Unpleasant
as it is to have to read or write
about, I express the tnith. Our
janitors like these messes no more
than any of us do. Indeed, we
should all be thankful that they
provide their services with such
enthusiasm; they are noble indi-

viduals whose job in life is every

bit important as the nuclear
physicist’s. What kind of world
would we have if 5 billion people
wanted to build, and not one
cared to or was willing to pre-
serve and maintain?

Coming home to a dorm that
has been spruced up with ten-
der, loving care provides stu-
dents with a comfort that is often
lost when home becomes a har-

bor only in thought. We worry ‘

about grades, partying, “getting
hooked up” and ﬁnding our-

as a very small state that should
be funded accordingly. I

Yet despite all this, the Rev.
Jackson continues to harp on this
issue. His reasons for doing so
are transparently political. He
would like to be a senator from
the new state, instantly becom-
ing, givenlhis prominence, the

a leading black voice on Capitol

Hill. This would have the added
beneﬁt of giving him practical

’ political experience that would

undoubtedly help him in his next
presidential bid. Even if state-
hood is never granted, the con-
troversy keeps» him in the lime-
light and thus, considering he

holds no ofﬁce, keeps him politi- I

cally alive. It is clear that this
entire debate is only a completely
self-serving device employed by
Jackson. ‘

It is very interesting that, while
the Rev. Jackson claims only to
be interested in obtaining the
beneﬁts of statehood for the citi-

selves spiritually. But these aspi-
rations are made workable in
reality more easily when we are
freed from the unpleasantness of
grime, dust and dirt. How won-
derfully nice it is indeed that we
are afforded the gift of men and
women who make our lives that
much more workable.

So here it is: a column that
speaks for slowing down and
appreciating that which is easily

overlooked, especially at a time.

when everything starts to be-
come hectic. But then again, the
busiest intersections in America
have traffic lights, -and because
they turn red every once in a
while, our courses in life take
directions that bring about days
that are new and vibrant. Some of
you might criticize me for not
addressing a “serious issue,” but
if you don’t consider our salva-

. tion from unsanitary conditions a

big deal and feel that paying
homage to our janitors is a point-
less endeavor, I must'admit that
I would be rather inclined to be

. sorry you read my printed words.

And if you happen to be “Annie”

or “Cal” or a janitor here or any— -

where, know that this column
was written‘ for you. I thank you
so much for all that you have
done. Have a nice summer; you
more than anyone else I can
think of deserve one.

Columbia a. bad idea

zens of the District of Columbia, I

never once has the concept of
annexation by either Virginia or
Maryland been brought up. Cer-

tainly either state, considering i‘

both states’ proximity to the dis-
trict and their close association
with it, could conceivably incor-
porate Washington into their
territory and political structure.
Of course, such an annexation
woul'dn’t guarantee Jackson a
Senate seat.

It is the clearest proof that this

entire debate is nothing but cheap‘ J . ,

demagoguery designed to keep
Jesse Jackson a force to be reck-
oned with in politics. The people

he considers his constituents,

though, would be betterfserved if
he devoted his time more to them
and theirproblems than to trum-
peting baseless comparisons with
apartheid and a purported solu-
tion that wouldn’t solve a thing.

It's about time for Pittsburgh City Councilto get serious

Pittsburgh City Council is often
characterized as and criticized for
being a group of people who act
more like soap-opera characters
than a body of government.

Over the past 10 years, espe-
cially the last four, “the members
of the City Council have become
mre of an embarrassment than a
group of decision makers for our
city.

Eugene “Jeep” DePasquale was
removed from his position as
president of Alcosan, the waste
department of Pittsburgh, because
he was gallivanting all over Eu-
rope, visiting major cities at Pitts-
burgh’s expense. He was attend-
ing conferences and conventions
on waste. Ben Woods, former

acting president, was recently
found guilty of unethical behav-
ior and sentenced to eight years
in jail at a country-club facility.

Mark Pollock was haunted by

rumors of his eating disorders
before he left the City Council
because he could no longer put
up with the ridiculous antics that
often occur in the council cham-
bers on Grant Street. Several male
members of council are riddled
by rumors of homosexuality and/
or extramarital affairs.

Michelle Madoff, who is often
depicted as a cold woman, is the
only member fortunate enough
not to have any negative rumors
ﬂoating around the city that
concern her. Michael Coyne re-

cently got into an altercation with
a Pittsburgh police ofﬁcer out-

I side a local bar that features go-

go girls as entertainment. During
this encounter, the intoxicated
Coyne boasted of his council

status to the ofﬁcer. Now tbatis
something to be proud of, Mi-
chael.

However, as amusing as these
characters’ escapades are, they

‘have really overstepped their

bounds by taking an official stand
on the Greyhound bus strike by

 

recommending that the citizens
of Pittsburgh boycott Greyhound
services. Pittsburgh possibly al-
ready has a bad reputation for
being such a union city, and now
the council members are further
promoting this label.

As a result of the violence since
the strike, the strike has become
a black spot on unions and
America. Strikes and unions are
not intended to cause injuries
and deaths in order to resolve
differences between labor and
management. So, our city gov-
ernment decides to side with the
strikers in this dispute. _

The strike and who is wrong
and who is right are really not the
issues here. What is the problem

is that it is none. of the City
Council's business, and it is not
their place or right to take a
position on the issue. The City
Council has enough to worry
about with smoking ordinances
and gay-rights bills that it is not
necessary nor warranted that it
get involved in such a volatile
dispute.

Once again, Pittsburgh City » J

Council and its circus of Key-
stone Kops for members have
embarrassed themselves and thus,
the city of Pittsburgh. But then
again, at least an average citizen
of Pittsburgh can always run into
an important and significant
political ﬁgure at a downtown
go-go dancers bar. _

Welcome...  
Pitt head football coach
formally introduced t

By Sean Hellman
Staff Writer

Please excuse Pitt if theyldid

A not have a chance to introduce

their new football coaching staff.
They have been busy for the past
four months winning a bowl
game, recruiting, and organizing
spring practice. .

Pitt's athletic hierarchy finally

found time to formally introduce
new head coach Paul Hackett
and his staff last night at the
Golden Panther “Meet the
coaches night” in the William Pitt
Union’s Assembly and Ballroom.

The function consisted of the
coaches mingling with Golden

. Panther guests and the showing

of the1989 Panther highlight ﬁlm,
“True Grit.” .

It was, basically, a chance for
athleticdirector Dr. Ed Bozik and

Hackett to show the direction the

football team will be headed as it

‘ enters a new century of football.
A Pitt football will celebrate its 100th

anniversary season this year.
“Personally, it's a great honor
to be a part of the 100 years,” said
Hackett. H ‘
The university made a point

that Hackett will stress academics ,

as well as athletics at Pitt‘.

“I get such a kick out of the
press who come to me and say
‘Coach Hackett, how can you
handle
requirements, it’s_ just going to be
so difficult.’ And I turn to them
and say ‘What academic
requirements? What are you

' ‘talking about?"

“If you mean aml going to be
concerned about the fact that
we’re going to collect from the
university 10 to 15 very qualiﬁed
people who are going to sit
around a table to talk with me
about the people I am recruiting,
and give me advice and a feeling
about their ability to be successful
at the university, that I’m going to
be concerned about that?’ Hell, I
welcome that! The more resources

William Pitt Union Assembly Room. ’

we can use at the university, the

stronger we are going to be. It’s.

not Paul Hackett’s program,_ it’s
the University of Pittsburgh’s
football program.” V

The former academic
requirement for student-athletes
seeking athletic eligibility was a
minimum score of 700 on the
Scholastic Aptitude Test and a 2.0
grade—point average.

Pitt passed stricter guidelines
for incoming freshman athletes
in January. The prospective

' student-athlete must now earn a
minimum SAT score of 750, a

minimum 2.3 grade point average
(2.0 in “core” classes such as
English, math and social sciences),

and rank in the top three—fifths of
his or her graduating class.

The “qualiﬁed people” from
the university which Hackett
mentioned is a special review
panel made up of Associate

Provost Jack Daniel, College of 

General Studies Dean John

Bolvin, College of Arts and 

Sciences Dean Mary Briscoe and
Dr. Bozik.

Hackett developed three
superstar quarterbacks while
holding the positions of offensive
coordinator and quarterbacks

coach in the NFL; San Francisco’s

Joe Montana, Dallas’ Danny
White, and Cleveland's Brian Sipe.

Graduation rates
to be made public

By ERIK BRADY
©COpyright

TODAY/Apple

Information Network.

Beginning Oct. 1, 1991, schools
must provide the NCAA with their
graduation rates. Here is how it
will work:

At the start, schools will provide
rates for students who entered
school in these academic years:
1982-83, 1983-84, 1984-85, 1985-
86.

In 1992, rates from 1982-83 will
be dropped and 1986-87 will be
added, giving the NCAA a
continuous, four—year rolling
average on graduation rates.

The NCAA will track graduation
rates for these six categories:

— All students.

— Football players.

-— Men’s basketball players.

— Wornen’s basketball players.

— Men’s other sports/mixed
sports.

—— Women’s other sports.

NCAA director of research
Ursula Walsh said the rates will
be further refined to subtract
students who leave in good
standing (for example, those who
transfer to another school),
yielding what she calls a “defined
graduation rate.” The defined rates
will then be broken down by
race in each category.

In addition to graduation rates,
the NCAA will track what
percentage of entering freshmen
in 1990 and 1991 are special
admissions and what number are
admitted to each major.

It also will track test scores and
grade-point averages by the above
six categories.

All this, Walsh said, is because
of rules passed by the NCAA at its
January session.

“We have just completed the
forms and will send them to the
NCAA Council this month. If
approved, they will then be sent
out to schools so they can begin

collecting data.”

The NCAA passed the rules
requiring schools to provide this
information under the threat of
Congress passing a law that would
have required it of any schools
receiving federal aid. The NAIA is
now considering similar
legislation.

The General Accounting Office
prepared a study on graduation
rates last fall when Congress was
considering that bill. The study
found that many schools already
collect the required information
to compile graduation rates. It
also found basketball and football
players generally graduated at
lower rates when compared to all
students.

Former basketball star wants to see today's players make money

CHARLOTTE, N.C. —— Former
Duke basketball star Dick
DeVenzio says players should be
allowed to make all the money
they can while in college.

The only stipulation, he said, is
that they can’t touch a cent of it
until they graduate.

“You can bet all sorts of guys

1990, USA
College

who are ﬂunking out now would
get diplomas before long,” .he
said.

. Here is his plan:

“I say the student-athlete should
be free to receive whatever money
he can from whatever source he
can,” said DeVenzio, a pre—law
major who played from 1969 to
1971. “The only rule is that the
NCAA control the distribution.

“Let’s say a Georgia Tech
booster gives Kenny Anderson

$200,000. ‘Fine. Now he makes
another $100,000 on a Chevrolet
commercial. Fine. All the money
he can get goes into a trust fund.
And he isn't able to touch it until
he graduates.

“What a tremendous
educational incentive that would
make. You might be 20 courses
away from a degree, but you’re
looking at a million dollars in
incentives.”

Nor does it bother DeVenzio

“Well, we have every CEO in
America bidding for players in
the business world and nobody
is too worried about that. People
say a school such as Northwestern
won't be able 10 compete
anymore. Have you checked the
Big 10 standings the last 20 years?
They haven’t been competing
anyway.”

DeVenzio, 40, a motivational
speaker and writer living in
Charlotte, is an outspoken critic
of what he calls “the NCAA cartel.”

“This cartel suppresses the
economic opportunities of a

, whole class of people,” he said,

referring to student—athletes.

“I don't think it’s right for a
university to say you only get this
much or that much. These kids
today give an inordinate amount
of time to college sports. The

colleges shouldn't be able to stand.

in the way of making it a
worthwhile pursuit.

It was as a Parade All—American
and a straight-A student at
Ambridge (Pa.) High School that
DeVenzio got his first distaste of

I the NCAA.

“When I was being recruited,
one college —— I don’t want to
name it —— offered me a seven-
year scholarship. They said if I
got a B average through
undergraduate school, I could
go to their law school free.

“The NCAA would say that was
wrong. The NCAA views that as
a competitive disadvantage

because not every college has a
law school.

“It’s a case of a ridiculous
blanket nile. There was no car
involved, no cocaine. Just an
education for seven years, but
the NCAA says that constitutes
cheating. That was my first taste
that something is wrong.”

DeVenzio ruffled a few feathers
at Duke after his senior year
when he criticized coach Bucky
Waters and his program.

“One columnist wrote that I
was ungrateful for my Duke
education,” he said. “People on
the street looked at me like I was
scum. Hey, Duke struck a good
bargain for my services. I didn’t
owe them anything. But that
experience stuck with me.”

DeVenzio heads an informal
group called “The College Players
Association” that exchanges ideas
and tries to promote reform.

He publishes a newsletter
entitled $tudentAthlete$$ 18 times
a year. Sometimes, he is howling
at windmills.

He has tried in vain to organize
a college players’ union—— several
coaches, including Colorado
football coach Bill McCartney,
allowed him to speak to their
players — and this year attempted
to convince the Southern
California football team not to
play in the Rose Bowl.

“They were asking those guys
to give up their month of
December so the school could
make $12 million,” he said.

In 1986, he tried to hold up the
start of the Nebraska—Oklahoma
football game by getting members

of both teams to pray"at“fﬁid‘-"f1“eld""

for 30 minutes.

As it was, five players‘ from;
each squad did kneel together,
briefly, in a show of solidarity
among college athletes.

Among other changes
DeVenzio would like to see are
immediate eligibility for athletes

THE PI'l'l' NEWS, Tuesday, April 10, 1990

Hackett

Continued from page 10

He has also coached Vince
Evans and Paul McDonald at
USC and Steve Bartkowski at
Cal-Berkeley while serving as an
assistant at both schools.

Bozik and Hackett also had
one Pitt victory to show as an
introduction to their fans. The
John Hancock Bowl win against
Texas A&M last December 31,
Hackett’s first game as Pitt head
coach.

Hackett called it the “El Paso
challenge" because of the
adversity the university was
experiencing from the firing of
Mike Gottfried.

“I really have a great feeling for
that group of young men who
went out to El Paso and found a
way to focus on a common goal.
That common goal had to do
with the word ‘finish.’

“That’s what El Paso was all
about. No matter what got in our
way (the 1989 season) we needed
to be finished the way our football
team would feel good. What
happened in El Paso has really
set the tone for where we’re
headed in 1990. We are forever
grateful to that group of

seniorswho gave us a lift-off.”
Hackett spoke of the attitude
he has noticed of the football

players, university officials, and
students at Pitt.

“I know one thing about the
men who come here to the
university. They come here to be
champions. When a young man
makes his decision to come here
to the University of Pittsburgh,
he expects to be the best. Coming

in new, as I am, that hits you right

in the face.

“These guys love a challenge.
Talking to the recruits and talking
about our (tough) schedule that’s
coming up. They say ‘that’s why
I want to come (to Pitt).”’

Hackett said he learned an
important football philosophy
while an assistant for Bill Walsh,
who won three Super Bowls with
the San Francisco 49ers, that will
stay with him forever.

“The game is supposed to be
fun. We started playing it as kids
because it was fun. Walsh had
people who were determined to
be upbeat and enjoy each other

“He demanded (of his players)
more than had ever been
demanded before, both

athletically and mentally. The

academic approach that he took
toward football fit perfectly with
me. This guy is more cerebral
that most pro football teams.

“The first dayl got there, I thought

Spring Special

I he was kidding. . . .he said there

were about 200 pass plays. I had
never been anyplace with more
that 30. But (the players) took it
home and studied and studied
until they learned it. Because they
knew when they went back the
next day if they didn’t know what
the hell to do, their ass was out.”

“That made it very Qlearfor me
that a balance between academics
and athletics is totally natural.
The best players are usually the
smartest players. The whole thing
comes together. If we’re going to
talk about raising the (academic)
level, we’ve got to talk about
knowledge. Knowledge is power.

That's how you get the job you
want. And, football knowledge is
football power. They are pushing
you and forcing you to learn.

“When we first got together
and talked to the team I asked
(administrative assistant to the
Pitt footbal program) Alex
Keramer to look up the definition
of team. The definition he came
up with was from Webster’s
Dictionary, ‘A group of people
working together working
together in a coordinated effort.’

“The group of people is the
University of Pittsburgh.”

“The collegiate sports enterprise
has increased in value
dramatically over the past 10
years, yet the athletes’ benefits
have fallen off dramatically in
that time.

“When I first started speaking
out in 1983, everybody thoughtl
was a complete kook. But over a
seven-year period, We seen a
