Lobbyists analyze U.S. aid to Israel

By Debbie Lincoln
Staff Writer

Professional lobbyists discussed
the American, Palestinian and
Israeli leadership positions that
have emerged as part of recent
peace initiatives in the Middle
East last night. ' '

Dr. James Zogby and Prof.
Jerome Segal advocated the
present position of the Bush
administration and its
postponement of the $10 billion
loan guarantee to Israel in an
attempt to bring both parties to

the negotiating table.

Sponsored by Pitt's Institute of
International Studies in Education
and the Middle East Forum, the
lecture also analyzed the recent
decline in Israeli-American
relations and its potential effect
on the peace conference.

“I’m impressed -by what Bush
has done, butl think it's going to
take an amount of creativity on
the part of American foreign
policy and its going to take some
support from the AmericanJewish
community,” said Segal, founder
of the Jewish Peace Lobby, an

action group dedicated to the
resolution of the Israeli-
Palestinian conﬂict through the
recognition of Palestinian self-
determination and the
maintenance of Israeli security.

“The administration feels that
the occupation must end 
They're quite explicit about the
fact that the territories must be
returned,” said Zogby, founder
and director of the Arab-American
Institute. “.Bush made it clear that
in the aftermath of the war that
movements must be made to

Fraternity opposes

 

new dormitory site

By Arthur Graziani
Staff Writer

Plans for new dormitories are
on schedule, but not all Pitt
students are happy to see the
construction under way.

Sigma Alpha Epsilon President
Bill Thomas has filed a complaint
with the university because the
dorms violate SAE’s lease with
Pitt for the fraternity house and
the surrounding property,
Thomas said. He said a letter.was
sent to the housing office in April
1991. -

“In our leases [which were

r established in December of 1982]

there is a paragraph covering
university construction, ” Thomas
said. “And in this paragraph it
says that all construction is under

the direction of the school but
subject to the tenant’s right to
privacy and peacefulness. ‘Well,
we feel that the dorms are an
obvious violation of that right.

“The worst part is that they
never consulted us. When they
came to us about the project,
they never said, ‘Do you want
this, yes or no?’ They just told us
it was being built,” Thomas said.
“That is why we felt we had to file
the complaint.”

But there are no plans to stop
the construction. The new’
dormitories, which will be‘
finished in July, weren’t brought
to the fraternities’ attention.
because the dorms are needed

Business college may/

cost CGS 700 students

By Sandy Lasswell
For T be Pitt News

. If the proposal to form a College
of Business Administration is
passed, the College of General
Studies stands to lose about 700
students, 14 percent of its
population.“

The College of General Studies
Student Government Council
wrote a statement last week
voicing its concerns about the
proposal’s impact on CGS.

The proposal stipulates that
the CGS business and business/
accounting majors would be
phased out by 1996. A

Some current CGS business
majors may not be able to finish
their degrees in CGS and may not

be eligible to transfer into the

College of V Business

Administration, the council’s state-

ment against the proposal said.
The council is also concerned

‘that the ’decrease in CGS

enrollment would mean a loss of
$21,340 in student-activity fees,
which would affect the council’s
ability to provide services for all
CGS students.

The needs of non-traditional

students who often need a great
deal of ﬂexibility in educational
options are notaddressed by the
proposal to form a business
college, the statement said.

The current proposal defines a‘
part-time student as one who
averages 14 credits a year. Many
CGS students do not carry 14
credits per year because of work
and family commitments. The
council asked if such students

would be allowed to attend the’, 7

College of Business .Admin-
istration. ‘ W

In other business:
-James Geary and Lisa Hoffman‘

presented a proposal for a new I

CGS student organization, the
Pitt Student Accounting
Association. After a discussion of
its ‘ budget requests, the
association was approved. _

-In a move to encourage CGS
students to attend University of
Pittsburgh football games, the
council has arranged a special
price for tickets to the
homecoming game against

‘e Syracuse on Oct. 19.

CGS students will be able to’
take four family members with
them to the game for $8.50.

Pitt Golden Girls battle lack of respect, recognitionl.

By Amy Felicetti
For T be Pitt News

Seventeen years ago, eight young women
stood along the sidelines during halftime
of the first preseason football game.
Without a formal name and without
performing before,‘ they stood side by side
as the band played.

Simultaneously, they whirled their blue
capes ‘ off and marched onto the field,
planting their white go-go boots firmly to
the ground and twirling their silvery batons.

The gold sequins lining their uniforms
glittered in the sun, catching the eye of
‘Clayton Hartman, the announcer.

“Ladies and gentlemen, the Pitt Golden
Girls,” his voice echoed. From that point
on, they officially became known as “The
Golden Girls." .

The Golden Girls’ style of performing
has gone through changes: Their white
go-go boots are history. But their purpose
on the field still remains. They are
performers, just like the musicians in the
band. »

“It’s entertainment. A lot of people think
we don’t do anything. We get comments
about not knowing how to dance, but they
don’t know what it's like dancing and
twirling a baton,” said Golden Girl Amy
Schmeltz. — '

“Visually, they add a lot to the band 
When the band stands still and plays,
people want something to look at, and
that’s when the Golden Girls perform,”
said Ron T assone, director of the Golden
Girls for the‘ past seven years. _.'

But the Golden Girls say no one knows

the amount of time and effort that goes
into perfecting each of their intricate

routines, as well as the “strict requirements"

they have to meet.

Each of the women is required to be

made up during each performance. Their

hair, which directors “like” to see a certain.
length, must be down and styled, and -

absplutely no nail polish or jewelry is
permitted during performances.

The Golden Girls often are criticized for

basically having this same look, but the_re

THE PIT!‘ NEWS, Monday, September 30, 1991

 

By Leon Fuksman
sum‘ Writer

The time for your oral
presentation nears. The entire
class stares at you as you approach
the front of the room. Your palms
begin to perspire, and your mouth
goes dry. You know something
will go wrong, and you wonder
why you ever volunteered to do
the report.

Most students experience stage
fright — even the most talented
orators get a shivering sensation
before a speech. Nearly90 percent

B of all people feel tension before

speaking before an audience,
according to public-speaking

"counselor Chuck Greenoff.

“Being anxious and a little
nervous is natural, and it helps to
deal with the speech. But there
are some people who let it impair
their performance; they fear
public speaking more than death,_”
Greenoff said.

He compared the nervous
anticipation before speaking to
the tension football players
experience before a kickoff. All
of their senses are tuned for that
one moment, which inspires the
athletes and helps them
concentrate harder on the game.

Not knowing how todeliver a
speech can also cause stage fright
In Speaking IstA PracticalMatter,
Bernard P. McCabe Jr., and
Coleman C. Bender said, “A
presentation consists of physical
appearance, bodily movements,
gestures, vocal quality, vocal
animation, eye contact, language
and audience adaptation.”

But all of these techniques can
be mastered, said John Damm,
assistant dean of the Joseph M.
Katz Graduate Business School
of Business.

Damm, who specializes in
communication and leadership,
suggested a series of steps to
overcome stage fright

as possible. Don’t rely on the
night before to sketch graphs or
charts, Damm said.

“When someone gives a talk,
they need to be aware of the
issues before coming to the
podium,” said Connie Rapp,
placement counselor at Katz.
“Being prepared helps to develop
confidence." I _
-Rehearse the presentation
beforehand.

Practice talking in front of a
mirror, or record yourself on
audiotape, which will smooth out
stuttering and any unconscious
pauses.

Also, imagine how the audience
will react to various parts of the
speech, Damm said. ’

0 Construct an outline or ﬂip chart

that traces the presentation, and E
look at it occasionally for key

words and statements. Learn the
sequence of ideas, rather than

placing an unnecessary strain .

upon yourself by memorizing the

I2’ublic-speaking anxiety can be Conquered

you can still proceed.

Damm said only the
introduction and conclusion
should be memorized.

“These should be short and

hard-hit in order for the speaker
to look directly at the audience
and grab their attention,” Damm
said.
-Arrive early to where the
presentation will take place.
Allow yourself time to make
subtle adjustments. Ask the janitor
to change the temperature of the
room.

Also, regulate the podium and
practice if possible before the
class enters. Thegpurpose of this
is to take your mind off -the
speech.

0 Relax, and become enthusiastic
about the speech.

Before starting, breathe deeply
several times and ﬂex your arm
muscles. Roll your head around
slowly to relax your entire
body.

Racism is a disease which must be cured, according to Robert
Harris, a visiting lecturer of the Baha’i Faith, at a Race Unity
Conference Saturday sponsored by the Baha’i Community of
Pittsburgh in Bellefleld Hall. _ A

“Race ‘is one of the issues that almost every establishment is
trying to deal with so as to accomodate everyone,” said Saeed
Mogharabi, a‘ Pitt faculty member and a management scientist
with ALCOA.

Mogharabi said the conference “gives us the opportunity to
promote racial unity and eliminate prejudices of all kind.”

Pinkie A. Familoni, Ph.D., a Pitt graduate who now works
for Allegheny County, said the world must realize that there
aren’t a lot of races in the world, “only, the human race.”

Familoni talked about the population increase of people of
color in America and how society must move toward greater
acceptance of the diverse cultures if it is to remain viable.

Education of the young is important in ending racism. Mixing

said. -

She ended her presentation by showing the differences
between overt racism and covert racism.

“Overt racism deals with the obvious examples of racism, like
burning crosses, swastikas, etc. Covert racism covers the
underlying motivations of racism and problems occurring from

Race unity examined

the races has resulted in the rejection of a pure-race theory, she’

racism in society,” she said. ‘
Familoni said people must combat individual and institutional
racism.

resolve the issue. He must deliver
on it.”

According to Zogby, although
public opinion in Israel is now
pushing for a freeze on the
building of Jewish settlements in
the occupied Palestinian
territories in compliance with
American wishes, the present
right-wing Israeli government has
no intention of either halting
settlement plans or giving.up the
occupied Palestinian territories.

“ [Israeli Housing Minister] Ariel
Sharon is determined to put
enough settlers in the West Bank
to make it impossible for any
Israeli government to withdraw,”
Se gal said, adding that rather than

I_____—_——______———____‘l
. |
I   PUCCINI   ;

I    good for Walk-in haircut only

 

a halt in settlement, right-wing
government officials will attempt
to stall on American demands
hoping that domestic pressures
in this country will eventually
account for a change in policy.
“Even if Bush is re—elected, five
years is the length of time of this
[particular] American problem.

_ Five years is something thatcan

be managed and can be lived
with, and crises can be endured.
The issue "of land and whether or
not there will be a greater Israel
is something _of all time, and I
would not expect to see the Israeli
right wing abandon its objectives
 but it will find ways of managing
this American problem,” he said.

Segal credited the 1988 decision

by the Palestinian National
the Palestinian7 ’

Congress, as
government in exile, that accepted

the idea of a two—state solution  

rather than the destruction" -of

Israel as being a catalyst to peace. , 

“The Palestinians took this step,

in my judgement, because they” 
were defeated in all of the wars '1 "

that were fought, and they had
accommodated themselves to a

reality that they cannot change,”. .

Segal said. “It was this‘basic

decision that the Palestinians‘

made in 1988 that opened up

whatever chances there are now -
for the resolution of the conﬂict. I

It was the Palestinians who
showed the greatest ability‘ to
move.”

“A lot of women’s movements
would say they are exploited, but

- they’re not. Their uniforms are

standard for majorettes,” said
T assone.

“We’ve grown up wearing
uniforms like these. It’s standard,
no matter how young or old you
are,” said Golden Girls co—captain
Joanne Demsher.

’ These uniforms are one of the
few items they don’t have to buy
themselves. Aside from a raincoat,
the rest of their gear is on their
own expense.

Shorts, practice sweats,
performance sweats, nylons and
shoes are among the list of
expenses for first-year twi_rlers.

all of it.

Surely at one point or another

someone has overheard them‘
complaining about their stringent
weight requirements. But believe
it or not, they seem to be in favor
of it.

“I think they’re very fair and we
need them. It’s discipline,” Boyle
said.

The weight requirement for
each woman is determined strictly
by height. A Golden Girl five feet
tall can weigh no more than 95
pounds. For each inch, five
pounds is added, and for a half
inch, an extra two pounds are
allowed.

So what happens if they don’t
make weight? '

They are cut from marching

the next game. Although they are

weighed in every night at practice,
Tuesdays are the ﬁnal cut days.
Some of them say they maintain
their weight with dieting and
exercise, but a few of them
sometimes “don’t eat.”

For Demsher, one of the hardest
things is “telling your friends that
they can't march because they’re
overweight.”

Many of the Golden Girls said
they hate to deal with the criticism

and the lack of support and
recognition.

“We are considered low man
on the totem pole. We were lucky
to get a black and white half-
page photo in the program, and
even that was a fight.  We don’t
get any support or recognition
either,” Demsher said.

“It’s not a high-school thing.
It’s a lot of hard work, and they’re
strict about things,” Boyle added.

T assone feels that the Golden
Girls “get a bad rap for no reason
at all."

So knowing the requirements,
the lack of recognition and all the
criticism — why do they do it?

“The band helps you meet a lot
of people. I used to be shy, but

I being in the band helped me
open up,” Golden Girl Sherry
Link said.

“You meet a lot of good friends
and get to travel,” according to
Golden Girl Lori Smeal.

The Golden Girls do travel with
the band to West Virginia, Notre
Dame and bowl games. They
also are eligible to earn one credit
per year for participating in
Golden Girls,

That's because no other desktop
computer brings such a full suite of
workstation features to bear on such a
wide range of research, analysis, report

Ethernet networking. .

And no other desktop computer sur-

“The need is too great,” Robinson said. “More and more
students are finding it difficult to find on-campus housing. The

Senior Kevin Newby agreed.

“I wasn’t forced to move off campus, but a lot of my friends

to have to bear it because new dorms are more important,"

According to the authors, the
all—nighter is so popular° at Harvard
that the unofficial motto of the
school has become, “Never put
off till tomorrow what you can do
in the throes of amphetamine
psychosis the last minute before
it is due.”

Beckerman said the editors of I

Lampoon chose to do a a parody
of Harvard life and students to
prove “just as many Harvard
students get by on the bare
minimum” as other college
students.

The authors also wanted to

break down the stereotype that
“students who graduate from
Harvard are much better
educated,” Beckerman said.
The editors of the Lampoon
summarized the majors and the
basic underlying theories taught
by Harvard in a special section in
the book called, “Let’s Learn
Together!”
The classics section is most

easily summarized with the.

blanket statement, “The Odyssey
is about ,‘Odysseus.’ The Iliad is
about ‘I1iadeus.”"

underlying theory to animal life:
All animals are different

The book provides illustrations
that clearly depict Seagulls as
“rats with wings” and bears as
“three parts cow, one part rat.”

The Lampoon magazine was
founded at Harvard in 1876 by “a
group of undergrads who
probably wanted to poke fun at
their masters,” Beckerman said.

The magazine started as a witty
gentlemen’s periodical and has
evolved into a parody of society
at large with a brand of humor
likened to “The Simpsons,”
according to Beckerman.

The’ Lampoon boasts such
alumni as William Randolph
Hearst, John Updike, George

Munster), as well as head writers
for David Letterman, “The

Hate speech on campus

‘ “Die fags.”
“Aryan by the grace of God.”
“Things have been going downhill since the kitchen

. help moved into the classroom. Keep white supremacy

alive!”

“Go home, faggots.”

These and similar phrases have become the center of
widespread debate on college campuses across the

" V nation.

The use of “hate speech” has risen in the past few yea rs.
According to Campus Voicemagazine, reports of campus
harassment have increased 400 percent in the past four
years.

Prejudicial incidents on campus have been tearing
administrations apart, as more and more ‘must decide
whether and how to punish perpetrators of violent

discrimination, anti—Semitism and defamation.

Drawing the line between what is considered hate
speech and what is not is extremely problematic.

Codes prohibiting harassment or threats are not
contradictory to First Amendment rights to free speech.
“Free speech” is not defined as‘ words that cause another
person to fear for his or her life.

“Free speech” does not mean you can say anything you

7_  want about anyone you want. There are limits, and they
'_ must be’ defined. Vaguely worded “hate-speech codes”

can easily evolve into an Orwellian “thought police”
where any “non-politically correct” statement is grounds
for punishment. Hate-speech codes should be specific in
stating only speech that carries a direct or implied threat
of violence should be punished. ‘
Hate—speech codes are designed not to infringe upon
freedom of expression but to protect the rights of minorities
on campus to enjoy an atmosphere free from intimidation

and harassment.

People should realize that those who speak out against
certain groups or races, as long as their conversation is not
threatening to any specific person, is not voiced in a
public place in a violent manner or does not imply

a physical harm, have the freedom to say what they want..

Everyone in this country has a right to say whatever they '
wantlto say. But the line must be drawn when blatant
discrimination turns to physical violence. .

The University of Pittsburgh’s student code of conduct
prohibits intimidating and harassing speech and
discrimination on the basis of sex, race, creed, religion,
sexual orientation and handicapped status.

This document is adequate to punish episodes of “hate
speech,” which are dealt with through the student judicial
board, the campus police or the affirmative action office.

There is a critical difference between two students
privately discussing what might be considered racist
views and one student walking up to another and yelling,
“Die nigger.” The former is protected under free speech;
the latter should be punished to the fullest extent.

Dr. Seuss a legend for generations
I m Mgmoatum

Jenna
Ferrara

When a reporter came into The
Pitt News office last Wednesday
night and told me Dr. Seuss had
died, I didn’t believe him, just as
I didn’t believe it when the

_ neighborhood bully told me on

the elementary-school bus that
then-President Reagan had been
shot.

It turned out they were both
right. a

The harbinger of doom showed

us the early edition of the next l

day’s Pittsburgh Post Gazette,
which confirmed the news: Dr.
Seuss, dead at 87.

The man whose Grinches,
Sneetches and Whos had

T+iEODoK seuss agisst ('5/2/91,- 1/25/tn)

   

an interview in Dr. Seuss From

Then to Now.

Buchwald told this story in his
column, and Nixon resigned the
next day. “Later I was welcomed

permeated American culture had ‘ in Sydney, Australia, as the man

died in his sleep.

"I would not eat them in a
box,” said assistant news editor
Megan Bertino mournfully.

“I would not eat them with a
fox,” I continued.

“I do not like them here or
there. I do not like them
anywhere. I do not like green
eggs and ham. I do not like them,
Sam—I-Am." We finished together
and turned glumly to our
computer screens.

Ironically, just that morning I
had read Man/in“K. Mooney, Will
You Please Go Now? to my two-
year-old cousin in the dentist’s
office. I didn’t try to explain to
her the political significance of
the book: a thinly veiled hint for
Richard Nixon to resign.

Dr. Seuss (Theodor Seuss
Geisel: the “Dr.” was added early
in his career for effect) has written
critiques of the arms race (The
Butter Battle Boole) and
deforestation (The Lorax) as well.

Columnist Art Buchwald had
taunted Geisel for “never having
written a political book, so Geisel
made Buchwald a special copy
of Marvin K. Mooney, where he
crossed out Marvin's name every
time it appeared and wrote in
“Richard M. Nixon,” Seuss said in

who got rid of Nixon,” Geisel
said. ’ '

Of course there were people in
America who didn’t love Dr. Seuss
— maybegﬁve.

Loggers in Laytonville, Ca.,
made national headlines with their
fight to banthe environmentalist
fable The Lorax from the
required reading list for second-
graders in the Laytonville Unified
School District about two years
ago. A

The book details the failed
efforts of the wizened orange
Lorax to save a peaceful forest of
Truffula Trees from the
machinations of the sinister Once-
ler,who destroys the entire area
by building factories which churn
out useless, shapeless Thneeds.

A general manager of a sawmill-
who fought against the book said,
“If I have a child who comes
home and tells me that what I'm
doing for a living is criminal and

that’s what he got taught in school, ..

I don’t see how you could
overreact to that."

The school board voted
overwhelmingly to keep The
Lorax.

The world has lost a great talent
who opened up the world of
reading and imagination to

millions of children. ,

Geisel ﬂattened the cardboard,
well-mannered Dick and Jane
characters of elementary-school
primers and replaced them with
the subversive Cat in the Hat, the
Hunches in Bunches and the
brown Bar—ba-loots.

He wrote 48 books, which were
translated into 20 languages and
have sold more than 200 million
copies. He won a Pulitzer Prize in
1984. "

He started his literary career as
editor in chief of Dartmouth
Co11ege’s‘ humor magazine,
engineered the successful “Quick
Henry, the Flit” advertising
campaign and wrote humorous
essays and cartoons for numerous
publications before he turned to
children’s books.

His first book, And To Thinle
That I Saw It on Mulberry Street,

' was rejected by 28 publishers

until Vanguard Press agreed to
take a chance on the book that
would change the _face of
children’s literature forever.

“T o laugh often and much; to
win the respect of intelligent
people and the affection of
children  to leave the world a
bit better  this is to have
succeeded,” Ralph Waldo
Emerson wrote. Dr. Seuss was an
unqualified success. The world
will miss him.

The winner of the 15th annual
City of Pittsburgh Great Race was
so elusive that he not only
disappeared from the rest of the
pack but from everyone else after
the race. ' _

Juan Quintanilla, 23, of Boulder,
Colo., by way of San Luis Potasi,
Mexico, won yesterday’s event in
a record-breaking time of 27:43,
eclipsing the old record by three
seconds. _

While Quintanilla made quick
work of the course, he took his
time in making an appearance to
the public, not reappearing for

another two hours following the

race.
Quintanilla remained with the
leading pack for most of the early

Ryder Cup

By Rob Mazur
Sports Editor

Two inches equals two
thousand miles.

At least that was true yesterday,
as the United States brought the
Ryder Cup home from Europe
after a six—year hiatus when
Bernard Langer rolled a potential
winning putt just right of the
hole, handing the Americans a
14.5-13.5 victory at the Ocean
Course on Kiawah Island, "SC.

The United States entered

part of the race. He began to pull ’
away around the four—mile mark,
but he still remained closeto the
rest of the field. _ ‘

Around the five-mile mark,
Quintanilla‘ began to pull away,
extending his lead to about 30
yards. By the-six-mile mark, he
was cruising with the rest of the
group of leaders at least 100
yards behind him.

“I stayed in with the pack until
around the f1ve—mile marker,” said
Quintanilla, _ through Jaclyn

~ LeBarton, interpreter for Citiparks.

“After the ﬁve-mile marker, I
just opened it up and let it go. I
didn’t even know if anyone was
around me.”

Quintanilla decided to enter
the race about three weeks ago
on the advice of his agent. He

-had been training for the Pan-

Sunday’s action tied at eight points
a side with the Europeans. That
alone was an indicator of good

things to come because the last‘

time the U.S. team entered the
last day of play in a position this
good was in 1983, the last time it
won. ‘ e

If Langer had made the putt on
the 18th hole of the ﬁnal match of
this year’s installment of the Ryder
Cup, the Europeans would have
tied the score at 14, thus keeping
the Cup another two years.
Langer’s miss came after Hale

Eventual winner Juan Quintanilla (199. far right) runs with the pack in yesterday's Grmt Race.

Irwin almost gave away the match

by shanking his drive and then

Chili-dipping a short chip, leaving
hin'us-elf a long putt for par. Irwin
came up short on his par attempt,
and Langer conceded the bogey-
ﬁve.

Langer drove the ball to almost
perfect position on the left-hand
side of the fairway but hit his
second shot too long and ended
up in the transition bunker area
of the green. He chipped to within
10 feet but then missed the putt
that would have given ‘ the

It was the same old story
Saturday in Minnesota.

The Pitt defense, once thought
to be the weak spot on this year’s
squad, had to rescue the offense
time and time again, keeping the
Golden Gophers out of the end
zone as long as it could until the
sporadic offense got on track.

Not to say that the offense was
entirely ineffective, but when a
team gets the ball inside the
opponents’ 20-yard linefive times
and comes away empty-handed
each time, it's enough to make a
coach grow old +- fast.

The first—ha1f Minnesota
touchdown drive began as a result
of one of those squandered
offensive opportunities. After Pitt
elected to go for it on fourth and
goal and was stopped at the two-
yard line, the Gophers engineered
a 17-play, 98-yard drive, capped
by a one—yard scoring run by
quarterback Marquel Fleetwood.

The offense never really did
get it going in the Metrodome.

Kicker Scott Kaplan missed four

field goals total on the day. He
was replaced by Don Silvestri on
‘the Panthers’ second extra—point
attempt. .

One, of Kap1an’s misses
followed a 40-yard punt return

* by senior cornerback Steve Israel,

Europeans the .tie. ‘
The contest was close at the

‘end of the first two days, as

neither the U.S. nor Europe could
pull away.

On Friday and Saturday the
action consisted of foursome and
four—ball competition. In
foursome, a two—man team plays
shots from the best ball position.
Four-ball contests consist of two-
man teams also, but instead of
playing alternate shots, the best

Sweeping upon us like a
tornado is the world’s premier

» sport. Yes, it is time for bliss once
:, _ again, as the National Hockey

League begins another exciting
season — we hope.

The league still has no contract,
as the players and owners
continue to squabble over free

I‘ agency (something this writer is

opposed to) for sheer integrity of
the game. NHL President John

Ziegler is confident a lockout can
be averted.

If not, the implication is that
play will begin without a contract.
The NHL has never had a strike,
and with the escalating price of
salaries and player demands, a
strike could be disastrous.

Which brings us to the point of
this preview of the upcoming
campaign, beginning in the
Campbell Conference with the
Norris Division and the St. Louis
Blues, a team which has tested
the electric waters of free agency

and felt the shock.

Campbell Conference

Norris Division

While Chicago and St. Louis
dominated during the regular
season, both were eliminated by
the Minnesota North Stars in the
postseason. What to expect this
year? Well, the Norris will be tight
all right, except at the top, where
St. Louis should give the rest of
the division the Blues.

While toiling in the free-agent
market for the second straight
season, the Blues got burned, or

THE PI'IT NEWS, Monday, September 30, 1991

did they? In gaining Brendan
Shanahan and Dave Christian,
two excellent wingers, St. Louis
was forced to part with bruising
defenseman Glen Featherstone,
center Dave Thomlinson “(to
Boston) and of course, Scott
Stevens (to New Jersey).

Then St. Louis dealt former
Penguin and odd-man—out Dan
Quinn and Rob Brind’amour to
Philadelphia for Ron Sutter and
young defenseman Murray Baron.
Got it?

Let’s see what these off—season
adventures have done to the
Blues’ lineup. Offensively, the
moves make the Blues arguably
the league’s most potent team
(exceptions are Calgary and

 

  St. Louis to beat out Detroit in tight Norris Division

They also add depth up front,
something they lacked last year.
This led to their demise in the
postseason.

With Brett Hull, Adam Oates,
Shanahan and Christian, the Blues
can score. The trade of Quinn
and the overrated Brind"amour
opens the door for center Nelson
Emerson (who has had a fantastic

camp), an immediate rookie-of— .

the-year candidate.

Ron Sutter and Shanahan bring
ruggedness to the front line,
another factor that St. Louis did
not enjoy last year. '

The Blues go four deep on
lines, with the likes of defensive-
minded players such as Bob
Bassen (16 goals) and Dave Lowry

Pittsburgh). See Hockey, page 12

European team of Nick Faldo and
Ian Woosnam by one hole. Before
this defeat, Faldo and Woosnam
had won six of the eight Cup
matches they had played together.

However, after a successful
morning, the U.S. fell victim to a
strong European squad in the
afternoon four—ball matches. They
managed to gain only 1.5 points
in the afternoon and led by a
score of4.5— 3.5 after the first day.

The second day started much
the same -way. In the morning,
the Americans again beat the
Europeans in three out of four
matchups, with Ballesteros and
Olazabal ‘again winning their
match, this time over Ray Floyd
and Fred Couples.

Again the Americans took a big
lead into the afternoon, and again
they blew it. Entering four—ball
matches with a 7.5 to 4.5 lead, the

Minnesota added a fourth-
quarter ﬁeld goal after an 82-
yard, 15-play drive, but that was
as close as it would come, as the
Pitt defense held the Gophers
scoreless over the remaining nine
minutes. .

While the defense allowed 345
yards to the Gophers’ offense,
the most it has given up all year,
most of those yards came in the
first half.

Also, 180 of those 345 came on
the two long scoring drives that
Minnesota managed.

The one offensive bright spot
for the Panthers was Martin.

He gained 170 yards rushing

on 18 carries and was the leading
receiver with five catches for 42,

yards.

Martin became the fifth first-
year Panther to run for 100 yards
in Pitt history. Elliot Walker, Tony
Dorsett, Curvin Richards and
Brian Davis were the other four.

Martin appears to have taken
the starting tailback job away
from Jermaine Williams.

Wiliams carried the ball eight
times for 66 yards against the
Gophers. However Pitt head
coach Paul Hackett has indicated
that he will use both Williams
and Martin in his one-back
offensive set.

U.S. team garnered only half of a
point in the afternoon when
Ballesteros and Olazabal halved
their match with Couples and
Stewart.

So the stage was set for a final-
day showdown. Twelve singles
matches would decide if the
Europeans would retain the Cup
or if the Americans would take it
home for the first time since 1983.

, The Europeans jumped out to
a 10.5 to 8 lead. Both sides gained
a half—point when the match
between Steve Pate of the U.S.
and David Gilford of England
was halved without being played.
David Feherty of Northern Ireland
defeated Stewart 2 and 1 to give
the Europeans the advantage.

Faldo followed suit, with a 2-

“I” figured since I was in shape, Lwould go ahead and run,’? —

Quintanilla said. '

Finishing behind Quintanilla, in order, were: Risto Ulmala,
28, of Lynchburg, Va., at 27:51; Jens Karass, 27, of Boulder,
Colo., at 27:53; Leonard Reyes, 29, of Tampa, Fla., at 27:56.

The winner of the women’s ﬁeld was not quite as elusive after
the race, but she also made quick work of the fast course.

Judi St. Hilaire, 32, of Fall River, Mass., blew away the rest of A

the challengers in the women’s division, finishing with a time
of 31:17.

St. Hilaire, unlike Quintanilla, had run the course two years
ago in 1989, finishing with a time of 31:41. She knew how the
course was and paced herself for it.

“Until the fifth mile, the course is mainly uphill,” said St.
Hilaire. “From then on out, it’s all downhill. That can kill your
quadriceps.”

The ﬁnishers behind St. Hilaire were: Albina Galldamova, 28,

of St. Petersburg, USSR, at 31:54; Christine Pfitzinger, 32, of '
Wellsley, Mass., in 32:14; Olga Markova, 23, St. Petersburg, I

Intensity, confidence and a little
friendship go a long way for
Linda Zols, and she is using all
three to help keep the Pitt

volleyball team winning.

Intensity; A stone—faced Zols
leaps into the air and smashes the
volleyball. “I really want to win,”
Zols said. “Being intense keeps
others in the game.”

Confidence: A“ service error
here, a hitting error there does
not bother Zols anymore. She
comes back more confident than
before. “I have a lot of confidence
now,” Zols said. “Our whole team
has confidence.”

Friendship: Zols considers her
teammates special. They are her
friends. “I like the girls on the
team; all our different
personalities make [volleyball]

. fun,” she said.

Zols is one of six seniors onthe

jteam. Her road to Panther

seniority has had its ups and
downs. Growing up in New York
City, Zols was a gymnast for eight
years. “Then I got too tall,” Zols
said. That was the end of her
gymnastic career and the
beginning of volleyball.

By age 11, Zols was playing
club volleyball and soon won a
New York City Championship
with her junior high—school team.

‘After this early success, Zols
~ attended the Mary Louis Academy,

a private school for girls. Zols, a

BLUE a corn sprnrr on

four—year starter, improved
greatly, but her team did not.

Recruited by many eastern
colleges, including Penn State,
Zols chose Pitt. Her decision was
not based on the college, but on
the players instead. “I liked the
players; we all got along real
well,’.’ she said.

So the 5-foot, 10-i_nch Zols
became an outside hitter on the
Panther volleyball team. She had
the talent but not the confidence
or concentration needed to be a
great offensive threat.

Not until her junior year did
Zols blossom into a great impact
player as well as an intimidating
force on the left side of the net.
“She has really established herself
as one of the hardest hitters on
the east coast,” said Pitt head
coach Sue Woodstra. 5

Another 1 hard—hitter is
sophomore Anne Marie Lucanie,
who playes on the right side,
opposite Zols. The combinaation
gives the Panthers a good one-
two punch. Lastyear Zols finished
third on the team in both kills
(526), and digs (257). She finished
first in the errors category with
155. Her best performance came
when she was named Big East
Player of the Week (Nov. 5-11).
She also earned the Panthers’
most improved player award.

“Last year I had her work on
concentrating more,” Woodstra
said. Obviously that has paid off.
This year Zols already has 158
kills and 91 digs early into the

season. Zols, a three-year letter
winner, is playing well. But she is
also "disappointed that the team
has had a rough start. “It’s kind of
a letdown in a way,” Zols said of
Pitt’s shaky 7-5 record. “We
expected to keep winning, like
last year.”

Keeping the Panthers winning
is what Zols wants. “Now we

have re—evaluated our goals and .

got our minds focused,” Zols said.
The Pitt volleyball team starts
Big East play this weekend. Zols
knows they have to win those
matches, but she feels Penn State
is the match that will make Pitt’s
_ season. “Penn State is the key; if
we knock them off, we will move
up in our region,” Zols said
Moving up in their region will

enable Pitt to crack the Top 20 ’

and get_a good seeding in the
NCAA tournament in December.
That is something Zols wants to
accomplish. “I definitely want to

win the first round [in the NCAA _

tourney]. Last year was great. [Pitt
defeated Ohio State in the first
round.] I would like to do it
again,” she said.

Having the team’s goals in mind,
Zols wants to end her college
career a winner. But first and
foremost she wants Pitt to be a
winner.

With these goals in mind, Zols,
an architecture major, is building
Pitt’s winning volleyball tradition
not with stone or wood but with
intensity, confidence and a little
friendship. ‘ ‘

(19 goals) as well as Rich Sutter,
who enjoyed an excellent playoff
series. With Rich, Ron and Coach
Brian Sutter, the Blues will not
lack in intensity. .

St. Louis now has two legitimate
scoring lines as well as two
checking lines, and depth is not
a problem.

Nor is it a problem on defense,
despite the loss of Stevens. While
his ﬁerceness will be missed, the
Blues have talent. J

eff Brown is the pOwer—play
catalyst, and his defense improved
dramatically as Stevens’ blueline
mate. How much he retained will
mean a lot to the Blues.

Garth Butcher came Over late
in the year from Vancouver and
now must be the intimidatorwith
Stevens gone. -

Paul Cavalinni is a great skater
and a smart defender. Baron has
a lot Of talent and played well as
a rookie with the Flyers a tilt ago;
he will be thrust into heavy
rotation. Mario Marios and Jason
Marshall round out a defense that
is solid. 1

Vincent Riendeau is young and
excellent in goal. Last season he i
posted a dominant 29-9-6 mark ~
with a 3.01 goals against average.

. Depth isn’t a problem here, as

touted Curtisjoseph (16 wins last
year), Patjablonski and prospect
Guy Hebert (24 wins at Peoria)

give Sutter a lot of options and '

trade bait.
Stevens’ loss will be felt, but
with leaders like Hull and Oates,

the Blues will rebound from the
shock. This team should be
playing late into May.

Surprise, surprise. The Chicago
Blackhawks aren’t going to finish
second, but the Detroit Red
Wings will, based on the strength
Of a young defense that is loaded
with talent. ‘

Steve Chiasson anchors this
group. If healthy, Chiasson
(missed 38 games) is an all—star.
Super Swede Niklas Lindstrom,
Soviet Vladimar Kostantinov (his
deportation papers are being

processed) and Yves Raciiie give V

the Red Wings four legitimate
stars on defense. . L‘

.The potential and talent is there;
experience is needed. Brad
lMcCrimmOn remains the
defensive leader, while veterans
Brad Marsh and Rick Zombo add
depth and experience.

On offense, all-"world but
somehow Canada-Cup cut
(shame on Mike Keenan) Steve
Yzerman makes the Wings go.
But Detroit has ‘three more
legitimate centers in Sergei
Fedorov, Jimmy Carson, who if
healthy and can refine his potent
scoring touch makes the Wings
real deadly, as well as former NO.
1 pick Keith Primeau.

The wingers are small, but the
addition of Brian MacLellan and
a healthy Bob Probert adds
strength.

Former Ranger Kevin Miller is
ready to develop into a big—play
man for Detroit, as is former
Devil Paul Ysebart. Ray Sheppard
comes Over from the Rangers and
adds scoring punch.

Tim Chevaldae played in 60
games and posted 30 wins, and

this continued improvement is

dire to Detroit's success. The
Wings lack size, but have scary
talent, deep enough to make deals
for the right ingredients, if
necessary. ’

One huge key for Detroit is to
win on the road, something that
does not come easily. They’ve
won only 16 games away from

the spacious Joe Louis Arena the

past two seasons.
The Chicago Blackhawks
meanwhile are having trouble On

the home front.

Coach Mike Keenan has never
been popular with his players
but has always won. Mr.
Blackhawk Doug Wilson had this
to say about Keenan: “NO team
works harder than the
Blackhawks, and no team has
less fun.” Wilson was traded to
San Jose, a-nd Keenan was
delighted: “He never _prOduced
when it‘ was all on the _line.”
Harsh stuff, but Wilson is gone,
and so is Denny Savard (dealt last
season).

It seems anyone who gets in
Keenan’s way is gone, too. The
Flyers eventually struggled with
Keenan, and their performance
on the ice indicated it.

Goalie Eddie Belfour, who won
every award last year, is holding
Out, and that means trouble. The
Hawks need to sign the talented
pipegaurd pronto.

_ But Chicago’s defense, led by
Chris Chelios and Dave Manson

remains solid. But Keith Brown.

and Steve Konroyd are in their
early 50s, and age is a factor.
Depth is also a problem with
Wilson and veteran Bob Mcgill,
both with the Sharks. An injury Or
two would be a blow.

Like the defense, the Offense
has two superstars in center
Jeremy Roenick and winger Steve
Larmer, a deadly One—twO punch.
Left winger Michel Goulet returns
from 21 27-goal campaign, but
he’s 31 and missed the playoffs
last year due to an injury.

Center Adam Chreighton
needs to rebound after scoring 40
times two years ago; he dropped
to only 22 last year. Dirk Graham
played in all 80 games and remains
the heart, but after that the offense
runs by committee and work
ethic. .

‘ Chicago is aging and is not as

deep as in previous years, but the '

big four are tremendous, and
Belfour is great. If injuries occur
and replacements aren’t found,

the Hawks are in trouble, and .

Keenan will be boilin’ like water.
Look out.

Last year’s Cinderellas, the
Minnesota North Stars, most
likely won’t end up in the dash

 ' part of tﬂe reﬁirtﬁ of a fine £Pitt .trac[itio'n'-l

for the cup, but they will be good
enough for fourth place in the
tough Norris. Jon Casey finally
got some recognition after quietly
holding together a team that was
awful for so long.

The North Star defense is big
and good, led by Mark T inordi
and Rob Ramage (who comes
Over from Toronto).

Veteran Craig Ludwig and

highly touted rookie Darian
Hatcher add punch.
Minnesota had a lot of trouble
scoring goals last season, and the
problems may continue this
season, although Mike Modano
looks ready to be a true star.

Age is a problem, though, as
Brian Propp, Bobby Smith and
Neal Broten are all Over 30 and
will be called upon to deliver too
much of the load.

Center Todd Elik arrives from
LA to team with snipers Brian
Bellows and Dave Gagner.

Minnesota has a lot of depth on

the blueline and may need to A

deal someone in order to add a
winger or two. Let’s see how the
city responds to a club that will
likely be .500.

Well, former Calgary General
Manager Cliff Fletcher has really
done it this time. Months after
becoming the Toronto Maple
Leafs’ new general manager, he
went out and got the goaltender
that the Toronto media and fans
had been screaming for. Grant
Fuhr is thernewest Leaf and will
have to prove why he is
Occasionally the game's best
netminder.

Toronto hasn’t ‘finished above
.500 since 78-79, and things aren’t
that encouraging this time. Fuhr
will help immediately, but the
Leafs are like Al Pacino at the end
of Scarface, full of holes.

Maybe that's why the Leafs
went to Switzerland to land former
Pen Mike Bullard. He joins the
aged veteran Glenn Anderson
and touted rookie Rob Pearson
as fresh blood for Toronto.

Daniel Marios, Gary Leeman
and Peter Zezel must recapture
their touch for Toronto to have a
prayer, because their defensive
corps is poor.
