Although undergraduate Pitt
students pay into the Student
Activities Fund each semester,
that doesn’t guarantee them the
right to know how the University
spends their money.

The $2.5 million Student Activ-p
ities Fund, which is derived from

the $80 Student Activities Fee that
most students pay each semester,
is a pot of money and almost half
of which is annually distributed

Pitt student-run television station UPTV to come back on air

By Gideon Bradshaw
Staﬂ” Writer

Laughter and gleeful exclamations
leaked out of the UPTV ofﬁce on
the fourth ﬂoor of the William Pitt
Union Tuesday night.

About six students stayed after
the student—run television station’s
meeting to discuss its return to
channel 21 — aired in University
residence halls —- on Feb. T7.

The students threw around
ideas for one of the new shows,
called “Life of an RA.”

“It will be funny, but also kind
of deal with real issues that people
run into when they come and they
start going to college,” said junior
Rachelle Haynik.

The revival comes after a two-
year UPTV hiatus that stemmed
from technical broadcasting is-

sues, which members managed to
ﬁx about three weeks ago. UPTV

A members don’t know why they

weren’t able to broadcast for so
long, but Pitt’s Computing Ser-
vices and Systems Development
recently reconﬁgured the station’s
connection.

Because of turnover in lead—
ership and lack of information
passed down, until recently no
one at UPTV knew how to upload
videos to the station.

Drea Richards, a senior who has
been with the club for more than
three years, explained that during
the 2009-2010 academic year, the
station broadcast intermittently,
though no one could explain what
barred the station from broadcast-
ing regularly. , V

The following year, the station
couldn’t broadcast at all.

Last semester, after searching
for more than a year for a solu-

tion to the glitch, senior Ernast
Sevo, the UPTV president, and
other members of the‘ club got in
touch with an employee from Pitt’s
Computing Services and Systems
Development, who reconﬁgured
the station’s connection to chan-
nel 21. ‘

“We’ve had to rediscover a lot
of stuff that would have been-good
to know,” Sevo said. He added that
about 25 students currently make
up UPTV.

Sevo said that he does not fore-
see any f1.l['tl‘l€I' issues with broad-
casting, as more of the members
are now savvy about the technical
side of running the station.

Sevo has been airing videos on
the channel sporadically for the
last three weeks in order to draw
attention to its return. When mid-
February comes, the club will re-
sume airing videos between noon
and 4 a.m.

Between now and then, the
club plans to notify Pitt’s student
body of its return to the airwaves
through flyers and tables in high-
traffic areas like Towers Lobby.

But UPTV has made sure to
keep up its online presence dur-
ing its time off air.

Members have maintained
a YouTube account, in addition
to Twitter and Facebook pages,
where they upload their work.

“I think more people will be
interested in making things now
that we will be on-the air,” said Sam
Potter, a senior who has been an
active contributor at the station
since he was a freshman.

— Though Sevo is waiting until
after the club begins broadcasting
regularly to set an ofﬁcial program-
ming schedule, brainstorming is
abundant.

Just as in the past, the station
will broadcast student—made proj-

ects like short ﬁlms, television
shows and sports, in addition to
other programming.

Haynik, who started with UPTV
freshman year, said that she in-
tends to continue many of the
club’s traditions.

“We do this thing called a 24-
hour ﬁlm festival where we meet
at noon on a Saturday  We come
up with an idea for a skit, write it,
produce it and air it at noon the
next day,” she said.

Students who participate in
the ﬁlm festivals usually produce
whimsical comedy sketches and
satirical short ﬁlms about Univer-
sity life. But students have created
other types of work during these
sessions as well.

Haynik mentioned a 20-min-
ute biography of Abraham Lincoln
ﬁlmed by students — the log cabin

among some of the highest—pro-
ﬁle student groups on campus
with no public record of how they

I spend «it.

The Student Activities Fund is
considered University revenue,
and under’Pennsylvania’s Right-
to-Know Law, Pitt does not have
to disclose publicly how it spends
its money. The only records Pitt
must make public are its 990 tax
forms.

But Associate Dean and Direc-
tor of Student Life Kenyon Bon-
ner provided the dollar amount
of the portion of the Student Ac-
tivities Fee that each of the ﬁve
formula groups-receives.

Essentially, Pitt’s Office of Stu-
dent Life grants authority to the
Student Government Board to
make regular public allocations
to fund student events and pro-
grams. But ﬁrst, a portion of the
money is divided among the for-
mula groups: yearbook, the radio
station, TeleFact, the Pitt Program
Council and a student-run com-
munity service program called
Student Volunteer Outreach.

The ﬁve formula groups — Pitt
Program Council, Student Volun-
teer Outreach, TeleFact, Panther

Prints and WPTS-FM — together
receive a total of 48.5 percent of
the fund each year, but Student
Affairs will not disclose how the
money is spent, though it keeps
records of annual expenditures.
SGB does not have authority over
the annual allotments of the for-
mula groups or their spending.
The Board distributes the

funding from SGB, and there is a
public record of the distribution
of funds. -

“The Student Activities Fee is
called the Student Activities Fee,
but it’s University money,” Bon-
ner said. “The ﬁnal decision on
anything Student Activities Fee is
Student Affairs.”

Bonner said that the students
involved in formula groups know
where the money is spent, but all
decisions about making the bud-
gets and expenditures public are
up to the Ofﬁce of Student Life,
which is under the authority of
Vice Provost and Dean of Stu-
dents Kathy Humphrey.

Bonner said the University

does not release staff salaries

— except for those of the top 25
highest-paid employees, as re-
quired by the Right-to-Know Law.
Also, many of the contracts found
in the formula groups’ budgets
have nondisclosure clauses. And
Bonner said it is not a “general
practice of most businesses” to
release such information.

Bonner denied requests to
provide an aggregate of formula
group staff salaries, which in-
clude salaries of faculty members
and students, without names and
to provide the cost of contracts
without nondisclosure agree-
ments.

“As a normal form of business,
it’s not wise to advertise the low-
est way you pay for something,”
he said. “When you are releasing
information, you have to be care-
ful with what you are releasing

University had paid previously
for a concert, the company would
negotiate based on that informa-
tion, he said. A A
Tom Misuraca, the assistant

director of Student Life and the

faculty adviser for Pitt Program
Council, agreed with Bonner that
releasing budget‘ items would
hurt negotiating power. But he
did say that students choose how
to spend the money.

“The organization is here for
recreational activities for the stu-
dent community,” Misuraca said.
“[Every program] that comes out
of here comes from students.”

Misuraca said that more than
250 students are involved in PPC,
and they decide what programs
to bring to campus. Students are
technically not allowed to make
money offers to individuals or
organizations that they want to
bring to campus. Instead, Mi-
suraca works with students to
solidify contracts.

“ [We] work together with mu-
tual respect,” he said.

Bonner said that in the 1980s,
Student Affairs decided that it
needed a better system for on-
campus programming.. It was at
this time that the University cre-
ated the Pitt Program Council,
and since then, the group has re-
ceived a signiﬁcant portion of the
Student Activities Fund.

Senior Matt Auger, a «Span-
ish and business major and the
PPC’s executive board director,
said that a lot of his time is spent
bouncing ideas off other commit-
tee members to formulate plans

  

Stepen Gugliociello I Assistant Layout Editor

 

for student programming.
“We try to make everything

as close to free as possible, when ‘

possible,” Auger said. ‘‘[Students]
are paying that money.”

He said that some events, such
as the annual trip to New York,
do require students to pay extra
money because only a limited
number‘ can attend. But'.he said
that big events, such as Bigelowl
Bash and most lectures, are free
because of ‘funding provided'by
the Student Activities Fund.

Misuraca said he could not
disclose the costs of these events

-and said that questions about «

his budget, should be directed to
Bonner.

The on-campus progressive
radio station, 92.1 WPTS-FM,
also relies on student input for
the distribution of its ﬁmds. But
as with the other groups, students
do not have the only or ﬁnal say
in how the money is spent.

Gregory Weston, the faculty
advisor for WPTS, said that he
oversees the purchasing of the
radio equipment, but students
make the recommendations.

Weston said that most of the

AWPTS equipment is at least 5

years old, and that the station will
run the equipment until it breaks.
He said‘ that he likes to keep the
equ_ipment up to date so that stu-
dents are acclimated to what they
might see in the professional ra-
dio industry post-graduation.
“So much of our equipment is
so expensive,” Weston said. “We

_ try to carry over as much as we

can to save up for a major pur-
chase.”

In December 2011, Weston
had to make an emergency pur-
chase after a transmitter broke

and knockedthe station off air
for two days. He said the trans-
mitter cost between $2,000 and
$3,000. But he would not release
any more information about the
WPTS budget. -

SGB President James Lan-
dreneau said that he has been
talking with Terrence Milani, the
Student Life associate director,

and SGB Allocations Chair Mike

Nites about the distribution of
the Student Activities Fund. Lan-
dreneau said that he is uncertain
whether the percentages of funds
for the formula groups should
continue at the current levels.

“I am looking to see if the for-
mula groups actuallyneed that
money,” Landreneau said. He
also acknowledged that he does
not have “jurisdiction” over the
formula groups’ ﬁinding.

The percentages of the Stu-
dent Activities Fund that formula
groups receive have not changed
since 2009 when the Student
Government Board passed a res-
olution that established the cur-
rent percentages of funding.

Any changes to the percent-

ages would require approval by‘

Bonner and Humphrey.

When asked if he would re-
lease where the money was being
spent if the Board suggested it to
him, Bonner said that he would
consider the Board’s recommen-
dation. 1

“Student Affairs merely del-
egated authority [to the SGB] 
We don’t operate independent
of the University,” Bonner said,
referring to the Student Govern-
ment Board. “I would listen to
[the Board’s] feedback and tell
them what we are comfortable
with as an institution.” I

Occupy Pitt holds first campus protgst

By Tegan Hanlon
Assistant News Editor

Familiar cries of, “Out of the dorms, into
the streets,” echoed down Forbes Avenue
Wednesday night. '_ _

But this time the shouts did not originate
from Occupy Pittsburgh protesters.

Instead, the demonstration that began at
8 p.m. at Schenley Plaza and wound up and
down Forbes and Fifth avenues stemmed

formed in January as a more education-fo-
cused local branch of the Occupy Wall Street
movement. '

About 40 people showed up Wednesday
night to march, some still wearing book
bags, others with signs in hand. But the

crowd didn’t contain only Pitt students. Oc~ :

cupy Pitt remains tied to the larger Occupy
movement, with Occupy Pittsburgh mem-
bers as well as students from neighboring
Carnegie Mellon University joining in on

H the mid-week march.

Sophomore Julia Radomski said that
Wednesday, Occupy Pitt marched against
police brutality — citing arrests made in
California at Occupy Oakland on Saturday
where police used tear gas on the demon-
strators. .

Carnegie Mellon junior Ernesto Alfons
marched along with other protesters in
stride —— he carried a book bag, his feet
bare.

The commuter said that he came onto
campus this morning and planned to stay
to join the protest.

“For every act of repression there are
thousands of solidarity actions,” he said of
his reasons for attending. He said he was
marching to ensure that police brutality
“doesn’t become the status quo.”

While the march remained peaceful -
with protesters occasionally walking out
into the streets, interrupting trafﬁc —- police
lined Forbes Avenue. Seven police motor-
cycles and two police cars sat parked outside
of the William Pitt Union in case anything
went awry.

“This is what democracy looks like,” the
crowd chanted.

Once the Occupiers reached South Craig

Street, demonstrators moved in different '

directions as Occupy Pitt leaders announced
that, “Occupy Pitt is no longer facilitating
this march.” ‘ 1

‘‘They’re like full—time and we’re like part-
time Occupiers,” junior Ryan Branagan said
outside of the Kiva Han coffee shop as about

, half of the demonstrators marched onward

toward Carnegie Mellon’s campus.

Branagan said that Occupy Pitt ended the
march because it felt that it had completed
its goal of raising awareness of the move-
ment on campus and gaining solidarity with
Occupy Pittsburgh. ‘
’ ‘‘We’re takinga back seat... going back
to do our homework,” he told a member of
Occupy Pittsburgh.

Occupy Pitt members estimate that about
40 to 50 students have joined the group so
far, and they expect it only to expand from
here.

“We didn’t see a movement,” senior
Karina Goulordava said about the need for
Occupy Pitt on campus. At the group’s meet-
ings, students join together to talk about
tuition and student _debt, among an array

. of other issues. __

Occupy Pitt will hold its next meeting

. Friday at 2 p.m. on the ﬁrst ﬂoor of Posvar,

Genetic advances pose ethical problems

   

Abdul-Kareem Ahmed
V Columnist

We all have an identity — that
signature that makes us different.
What if what we call our identity
could be reduced to a four—letter
alphabet? I’m talking about ge-
nomes.

Recently, as reported by The
Washington Post, it’s become
possible to decode someone’s ge-
nome in just one day for $1,000.
That means an average person,
with a bit of ﬁnancial shifting,
could probably afford to get. it
done.

This is a relatively recent de-
velopment. To put the advance-
ment into perspective, the service
would have cost $100 million in
2001, and it certainly wouldn’t be
completed in one day, according
to the National Human Genome
Research Institute, a part of the
National Institutes of Health;

If we are to extrapolate from
the steady price drop over the
past decade, it’s not hard to imag-
ine a time in which sequencing
one’s genome could cost $100.
Soon, discovering 13 billion base
pairs —— the basic units of your
DNA — could cost as much as an
iPod.

Genomics is ringing the front
doorbell, and we must invite it in.

And with that, we must address
the relevant issues. Possessing
your entire mapped genome has
many implications, both promis-
ing and foreboding.

Consider the current use of
genetics in medicine. If a person
suspects an inheritable disease
—— say breast cancer — she visits
a genetic counselor. The counsel-
or will test her genome for only
a handful of genes. The test can
cost anywhere from several hun-
dred to several thousand dollars,
according to the National Cancer

Alnstitute. Humans have about

20,000 genes, mutations in any
of which have the potential to
cause disease.

Thus, imagine what a rou-
tine physical examination such
as your annual checkup could
become. If your doctor had your
entire genome at hand — already
assessed against a bank of known
disease—causing variations — you
could get a prospectus on your
entire life. You have the poten-
tial to know diseases you will or
might have in advance, although
many diseases manifest them-
selves later in life. This could
certainly help people plan their
lives appropriately. Do you want
to start a family? Buy a house
mortgaged for 30 years? This is
of course assuming you want to
take the red pill.

There are always two sides to
the coin. Genetic information is

 

extremely sensitive. For one, in-
surance companies could argue
that they should be granted ac-
cess to your genome. They insure
you and might claim that remain-
ing oblivious to your body’s future
is a poor investment strategy. If
they could assess your genes, it
is possible your premiums would
rise. Until recently, this was
never a problem, likely because
the state of technology made the
question irrelevant. But the tech-
nology is now here to stay.

There has already been legis-
lation in relation to this issue. In
2008, Congress enacted the Ge-
netic Information Nondiscrimi-
nation Act to prohibit the use of
genetic information in health
insurance and employment. It
unanimously passed in the Sen-
ate, but not in the House, where
one congressman of 415 voted
against it. Knowing his voting
tendencies, when I saw that there
was a lone opponent, I knew who
the dissenter must be: U.S. Rep.
Ron Paul (R-Texas). The GOP
candidate had his reasons, as al-
ways. But his usual plea for such
regulations to be determined at
the state level and for the federal
government to avoid enacting
blanket legislation brings to sur-
face another issue.

Sure, such information could
be used to discriminate and raise

THE STAMATTAOK

Art should keep pace with changing technologies, consumerpreferenees

By Nick Stamatakis
Columnist

Last month, we learned that it
can be really embarrassing when
your cell phone goes off —— espe-
cially if you’re watching a classi-
cal music concert in New York or
Slovakia.

The consequences for the of-
fender ‘in the former incident
— an unfortunate patron at _a
January New York Philharmonic
concert — were dramatic. Af-
ter the familiar marimba iPhone
ring interrupted a particularly
poignant section of Mahler’s

, Ninth Symphony, the conductor, .

Alan Gilbert, dropped his baton
and turned around to glare at
the phone’s mortiﬁed owner. Ac-
cording to the New York Times,
the crowd demanded that he “get
out” and pay “thousand—dollar
ﬁnes.”

In Slovakia, as publicized by
a now-viral YouTube video, a
similar interruption elicited a
much different response. After
a few seconds of staring at the
off—screen offender, theperform-
ing violinist, who was giving a
solo recital, quickly improvised a
short riff on the ring tone, much
to the delight of everybody in the
room. Instead of yelling, the au-
dience quickly applauded and the
evening continued as normal.

In both cases, the cell phone

interruption was obtrusive, ruin-
ing the respective pieces at key
points. Both could be seen as

R symbols of an increasingly rude,

unsophisticated modern audi-
ence. But the response in New

York —— a death stare followed by V

shouting — should also be seen.

as a symbol: not of the audience’s I

faults, but of an increasingly out-
of—touch artistic community‘ in

c the United States.

I say “out- of—touch” because art
has arguably never held a smaller
position in the national cultural
consciousness. Overall, accord-
ing to a 2010 National Arts Index
study, the average American con-

sumer  reduced, his ‘ spending

on  16 percentlsince "2002,
while philanthropies have reduced
such spending by an even larger 19
percent. Traditional theater and
classical music are declining, and
visual artists, aside from a select
few at the top of the distribution,

are struggling with decreases in

commercial opportunities.

The New York conductor’s
ﬁerce response underscores a
prevailing —- and misguided —
sentiment in the artistic. commu-
nity: Increasingly dumb and un-
intelligent American audiences
simply don’t appreciate art like
they used to. The popularity of
reality TV and bland consumer-
ism has ruined the public’s taste;
they would rather spend money
on “Transformers” than Tolstoy.

As writer and activist Gore Vidal
complained, we’re a country with
“no intellectual class” that is “rot—
ting away at a ﬁmereal pace.”

But before you write off cur-
rent Americans as too lazy to
appreciate art, -consider the
marketplace for entertainment
in‘ healthier times. Previously,
the actual process of attending
the theater was more pleasur-
able than a night home in front
of a black-and-white TV set. But
with today’s deluxe—screen tele-
visions, the hassle of a night-out
— dressing up, ﬁnding parking,
sitting still in an uncomfortable

‘room — renders‘ it comparative-

ly impractical and inconvenient.
Asother forms of entertainment
have modernized to ﬁt consum-
ers, theaters, art museums and
symphony halls have remained
stuck in the past.

This might sound shallow.
Art, after all, is supposed to
transcend petty concerns like
comfort; a lifting melody from a
violin sonata or the graceful bend
of a ballerina should more than
compensate for inconveniences
in seating arrangements.

But a 2002 john S. and James
L. Knight Foundation study
found this perception to be un-
true. When evaluating patrons’
overall experiences at the sym-
phony hall, the actual work be-
ing presented or the quality of
the performer — save extreme

As other forms of
entertainment have
modernized to fit consumers,
theaters, art museums
and symphony halls have

cases — had no effect on classi-
cal music listeners’ enjoyment.
The “art” itself was almost always
well-received.

The physical aspects of the
night, however, often ruined
things. A bad parking experience,
uncomfortable temperature set-
tings or small seats could com-
pletely throw off anything good
the art accomplished. Even long-
time classical music admirers —
the ones who would theoretically
appreciate the importance of the
music itself — went out of their
way to recount to the study team
decades-old stories about un-
comfortable evenings.

This brings us back to the
Slovakian violinist. Rather than
adopting . the scolding manner
of a self-righteous schoolteach-
er, he remembered that he was

there to serve the audience. His
lighthearted gesture probably
endeared more fans to classical
music than the angry scolding.

Art should always challenge
and provoke. As Franz Kafka once
said, good art is about “melting
the ice within  awakening dor-
mant cells  making us more
fully alive, more ﬁilly human, at
once more individual and more
connected to each other.” The
traditional institutions of the-
ater, music and visual art are per-
fectly equipped to do this. But the
artistic community must remem-
ber that in the 21st century, any
organization needs to learn how
to market itself, and more impor-
tantly, how to produce a pleasur-
able experience for patrons.

can no longer feign ignorance.
As the technology advances, genetics will

premiums. However, a person with excellent ge-
netics might want a discount from his insurer.
He might want to ﬂaunt his genome and get his
genes’ worth. Genes go both ways.

Again, this raises another issue. John Rawls,
an American philosopher considered by many
to be the most important political philosopher of
the 20th century, developed a social contract the-
ory. According to Rawls, the best way to approach

, such an issue would be to imagine a veil of igno-

rance. One should make such social decisions,
such as whether genetics should be relevant to in-
surance, imagining ignorance of one’s own status
in society. If you did not know whether you’d be
rich or poor in a society before making its rules,
you’re likely to formulate rules that would favor
the most disadvantaged members.

Thus, in this case, we should make decisions
concerning the use of genetics‘ based on the as-
sumption that we do not know what our own ge-
netics holdfor us in the future. But this is exactly
the tipping point we are currently at. Fifty years
ago, this theory would make more sense. How-

 

continue to become a greater social issue.

Genes are sometimes a ticking time-bomb,
but sometimes they permit us to accomplish the
most amazing feats. We already have social con-
structs that will surely respond to the advancing
technology in how we manage our health, make
future plans and more.

Before genetics were understood, the notion
of identity transformed from being a concept in
the realm of philosophy and theology to, most
recently, one in the realm of psychology. Now
identity is coming to be known as one’s genetic
signature, a more physical entity. It seems we
have been on a mission to reduce this concept to
the fewest letters possible. Genetics is the point
beyond which you cannot reduce.

I may have taken liberties to make my point.
Identity does involve genetics, but it’s not all na-
ture; it can also be nurture. Our individual experi-
ences surely supplement our identities. The differ-
ence is that the technology to reduce experiences
to a simple code has not yet arrived. It has for
genetics, and we need to address its now unavoid-
able sociopoliticalpresence and consequence. I

It would seem that in his article “SGB drop boxes not completely fool-
proof,” reporter Michael Ringling took an elevator from the fourth ﬂoor
William Pitt Union ofﬁces of The Pitt,News to the eighth ﬂoor and con-
veniently walked to SGB’s offices at the end of the ﬂoor. The offices he
passed by, however, would have added signiﬁcant insights to his article.

‘ Those rooms include the office spaces of GPSA (Graduate and Profes-

sional Student Assembly) and CGS (College of General Studies) Student
Government. In order for Pitt’s Collegiate Readership Program to live
up to its promise and to the wishes of the majority of this year’s Board,
the Board decided that drop boxes accessed using Pitt IDs will be used
to dispense the newspapers. This decision is positive for students be-
cause it means that the Collegiate Readership Program will continue.
However, for Ringling to focus his interviews on the SGB members who
voted against the program is both journalistically irresponsible and self-
serving for opponents of the program. If he had simply stopped on his
way down the hall and asked the members of those respective student or-
ganizations if they were interested in discussing cost-sharing options for
ﬁmding the readership program, they probably would have said, “Yes.”
For it is those students, and other University employees, who have been
‘beneﬁting disproportionately from reading newspapers purchased us-
ing the Student Activities Fund. Mr. Ringling would not have had to walk
far, but he would not have misinformed the readers of The Pitt News.

WHAT TO DO THIS WEEKEND

Forget hlookhuster movies, explore cinematic art at Pittsburgh film theaters

By Larissa Gula
Staff Writer

It’s easy to get caught in the H01-
lywood rut. Moviegoers in Pitts-
burgh often gravitate toward the
two big-budget ‘movie theaters:
SouthSide Works Cinema or the
AMC Loews Waterfront 22.

But for the blockbuster cin-
ema cynics and the cash-strapped
scholars, Pittsburgh has several
affordable and more indie movie
venues. Thanks to Pittsburgh
Filmmakers and the Hollywood
Theater, there’s no reason cineph—
iles need to ﬁnd themselves hun-
gering for something artsier.

Hollywood Theater
144"§ Potomac Ave.

Travel to Dormont, and stu-
dents can ﬁnd the single—screen,
80-year-old Hollywood Theater.
It runs a variety of ﬁlms, from an-
ime to classics — such as “Gone
with the Wind” — to documenta-
ries to cult classics. (“The Room”
is shown at least once every
month.)

The Hollywood re—opened last
June after‘ extensive remodeling
of the seating area and the sound
systems.

executive director John Maggio
said. “We’re one of the few the-
aters with a tier balcony. People
love our enormous screen, and it’s
also curved. It just makes the ex-

perience even better when you’re.

watching the ﬁlm.”

The Hollywood obtained non-
proﬁt status one month ago, giv-
ing it more ﬂexibility in its ability
to screen ﬁlms and maintain its
operations. But the Hollywood is
not just a theater —— it’s a commu-
nity resource, drawing extra busi-
ness to local shops in the evening
or during the day.

Screenings here are based on
a mix of research and public sug-
gestions, so students with a par-
ticular ﬁlm in mind are always
welcome to submit their ideas.
Maggio noted that many ﬁlms
screened here end the same way:
in applause.

“It doesn’t get any better than

hearing people clapping at the

end of a ﬁlm,” he said.

Melwood Screening Room

Pittsburgh Filmmakers aims
to raise public awareness and un-
derstanding about ﬁlm and visual
arts. To promote this, the non-
proﬁt offers classrooms and art
galleries at the Melwoodlocation.

The ﬁlms screened here should
be viewed as works of art, said
Gary Kaboly, Pittsburgh Filmmak-
ers’ director of exhibition.

The theater itself is an inti-
mate venue — a very simple room
with enough seats for 130 people
to watch ﬁlms ﬂicker on the big
screen. Kaboly said it’s an ideal
placeto View ﬁlms.

“Because [the ﬁlms] are works
of art, it is important that they be
seen in the medium in which they
were created, on a big screen in a
darkened room with others shar-
ing the experience,” Kaboly said,
adding that what sets ﬁlms at
the Melwood apart from those at
places like the Waterfront is the
content of the ﬁlms, not the the-
ater itself.

The Melwood plays fewer
movies than some of the bigger
theaters in the city, but the sched-
uling is diverse. Some are classics,
some didn’t get a national release
and some are locally made-

The theater is named after

the theater itself has been open

include contemporary, foreign

Kaboly said.

Regent Square Theater

The Regent Square Theater,
Pittsburgh Filmmakers’ third
theater, is one of the last single-
screen neighborhood theaters in
the region. Built in 1938, the the-
ater is now surrounded by small

; “local shops and cafes in Regent

Square and tends to run better-
known classic and artistic ﬁlms.

Older viewers often remember
seeing ﬁlms such as “The Day the
Earth Stood Still” and “Vertigo” at
this theater in the past. This tra-
dition continues with the Sunday
night classic ﬁlm series.

“We ofteniget compliments on
our Sunday night classic series at
Regent Square,” Kaboly said.

“Patrons thank us for the op-
portunity to see an older ﬁlm
on the big screen the way it was
meant to be seen.”

Planned renovations promise

that this old theater will remain
comfortable and stylish. 3

WPTS COLUMN

Quick mixtapes a mixed 

By Andrew Gretchko
Staﬁ"Wri ter

In the battle for the music industry, the lines
have been drawn.

The bigwig execs want to nickel-and-
dime you for every penny you’ve got, forc-
ing you to pay for each and every song an
artist releases. That’s how things used to
work. But like Biggie said, “The game done
changed.”

We’re living in what
people like to call The
Information Age. The L
Internet, cell phones
and all other kinds of
technology that people
never dreamed could
be real have forced us  '
to live a 24/7 lifestyle.
Something is always
happening, and if

Twitter, Facebook and
blogs every ﬁve min-
utes, you might miss
it. Yes, we’ve all ac-
knowledged that social
media has changed the
way we live, but not often
enough do we . :
pay homage to what it

industry.

Without the help of
a main—stream record
label, Pittsburgh’s own MCT Campus
Mac Miller has launched
his way to the top of hip—hop stardom. With
the promise of a new song every 100,000 fol-
lowers, Mac Miller vaulted his way to Twitter
fame, gaining 1,000,000 followers in what
he called his “Road to 1,000,000” campaign,
which eventually ended in the release of a
mixtape titled I Love Life, Thank You. As
Miller himself proclaims on the mixtape’s
title track, “I just threw this f*ckin’ mixtape
together because I love y’all.” .

This trend of quickly assembled mixtapes
is in no way uncommon, with many other art-
ists following suit, includingbig-name artists
who are signed to big-name labels. Take
Chicago emcee Lupe Fiasco, for example.
After Atlantic Records refused to release his
album, Lupe went on a nationwide tour to
prove to Atlantic that his music was indeed
popular enough to sell.

After this technique failed to impress the
record company, Lupe took matters into his
own hands, releasing a mixtape titled Friend
of the People: I Fight Evil. Half thank-you to
his loyal fans, half rebellion against Atlantic,
the mixtape demonstrated that the power
that formerly belonged to the record labels
might be back in the hands of the artists
themselves.

 

   
  
  

While this new barrage of — mostly —
free music has started to ﬂood the web, it’s
been called into question whether the high
volume of tracks being produced are inﬂu-
encing the quality of the music itself.

Unlike those of official albums, the beats 1

for mixtapes can be taken from virtually
anywhere. If they’re producing a mixtape
overnight, as many artists seem to do, they
simply rap over someone else’s beat and call
it a day. The unauthorized usage of some-
one else’s music is not legal, but that’s a
discussion for a different
column.
While this is

mixtapes --
the case can
be made that
mixtapes give

' more produc-
ers a shot at
success — it
does occur
often enough
to make peo-
ple question
whether cer-
tain artists
would be good
 - over their own
H beats or whether they
 need to implore the help of
others for their own beneﬁt. The

same laws that govern music apply‘

here as well.

The breakneck speed of mixtape pro-
duction has also caused a lack of effort on the
artist’s part, as many mixtapes contain only
a few good tracks and leave the rest as ﬁller.
Unlike in the good old days, today’s mixtapes
— and even albums for that matter — might
only contain one or two likable songs, as
artists try to appeal to wider audiences and
seem to sell out far more often.

Again, there’s a plus side to this for the
artists who are able to gain fans at a much
faster rate by releasing a higher volume of
music —— especially when it’s free. But do
the audiophiles and the true fans actually
beneﬁt?

As a self-proclaimed music lover, I’ve
found that it is often too hard to keep up
with the sheer amount of music being put
out in such a short time span. Before I’m
even done giving one mixtape a good listen,
another has been released, often causing me
to quickly skip through mixtapes without
giving them the time they deserve.

Hey, at least I’m doing a good job of ﬁlling
up the hard drive on my iPod.

Facebook’s I

By Brandon Bailey
& Troy Wolverton
San Jose Mercury News (MCT)

SANJOSE, Calif. — In a milestone

for one of Silicon Valley’s hottest -

companies, Facebook on Wednes-
day ﬁled papers announcing a $5
billion initial public offering of
stock in the world’s biggest social
networking business. ‘
The stated size of the offering is
smaller than expected, after weeks
of speculation by analysts and in-
dustry observers who predicted

 ,‘_Eacebook might seek up to $10
’ billion. But documents indicated

the ﬁgure is preliminary; the com-
pany could revise the numbers as
it prepares to begin selling stock

> this spring.

With the ﬁling of its initial pro-
spectus, which states that it intends
to trade under the symbol “FB,”
Facebook is ofﬁcially launching
Silicon Valley’s most widely an-
ticipated stock offering in recent
years. For the Menlo Park, Calif.,
company and its 27-year-old co-
founder Mark Zuckerberg, it rep-
resents an oﬁicial transition from

A, wildly successful startup to one of

the Valley’s corporate giants.
Industry sources expect the
stock offering will set Facebook’s
overall value between $75 billion
and $100 billion. The papers ﬁled
Wednesday do not specify a price
or how many shares are being of-
fered, although they indicate the
company will have two classes of

, shares. The company is expected

to release those numbers in com-
ing weeks.

But the ﬁling does provide an
initial glimpse into details of Fa-
cebook’s operations and ﬁnances,
which the privately held company
has closely guarded until now. For

example, the company disclosed
that it earned $1 billion in proﬁt
on $3.7 billion in revenue last
year, after sales rose 88 percent
from 2010.

Facebook ﬁrst turned a proﬁt
in 2009, when it earned $229
million on $777 million in sales,
according to the ﬁling. And the
company is not hurting for cash.
At the end of 2011, Facebook had
$3.9 billion in cash and market-
able securities, up from $1.8 bil-
lion at the end of 2010.

Zuckerberg, who serves as
CEO, owns 28.2 percent of Fa-
cebook — a share ‘that is sig-
niﬁcantly higher than previous
reports have indicated.

Given the company’s high
proﬁle and proﬁtability, howev-
er, his compensation was rela—.
tively modest last year. It totaled .
$1.5 million, which includes the
$692,679 it cost Facebook for
Zuckerberg and his friends and
family to ﬂy on a chartered air— “
plane. Facebook paid Zuckerberg
$483,333 in salary last year and
gave him a $220,500 bonus.

But the compensation of
Zuckerberg’s fellow executives
was far less modest. Facebook
paid its chief operating officer,
Sheryl Sandberg, $30.9 million
last year, an amount that includes
stock awards worth some $30.5
million. Chief Financial Ofﬁcer
David Ebersman received $18.7
million last year, which includes
$18.3 million worth of stock
awards. And engineering chief
Mike Schroepfer received $24.7
million last year, including $24.4
million in restricted stock.

Facebook has also seen its
user base grow phenomenally
over time, although the ﬁling
indicates that the growth has
slowed markedly.

While there have been larger
IPOs in the tech industry, an ini-
tial offering of $5 billion would

i still outrank any other Internet-

based company’s debut. Google’s "
initial offeririg“in*2004, at $1.7 5‘

billion, held the previous record
for the largest Internet IPO by a
U.S. company.

Morgan Stanley was listed as
the lead underwriter of the stock
offering, after beating out Gold-
man Sachs for the lucrative fees
that go with that position. Gold-
man and several other ﬁrms will
also participate, however.

By some estimates, Face-
book’s IPO is expected to create
between 500 and 1,000 million-

aires among Facebook employees ,

who have been granted company
stock —- as much as one-third of
its workforce.
And although some contrar-
ians suggest the company is over-

valued, the IPO is expected to ce-
ment Facebook’s standing as one
of Silicon Valley’s most valuable
companies — worth far more, for
example, than Hewlett—Packard’s
market value of $55.5 billion.
Google, by comparison, has a mar-
ket capitalization over $188 billion,

whereas Apple is worth more than V

$425 billion.

Facebook is much smaller than
those companies, with just about
3,000 employees and an annual
revenue estimated at $4 billion.
But it has been on a rapid growth
curve. ’

The Facebook website was ini-
tially created for Ivy. League col-
lege students when Zuckerberg
launched it from his Harvard dorm
room in 2004. A few months later,

Zuckerberg moved to Palo Alto, Ca-
. lif., and opened the rapidly growing

social network to the general pub-
lic two years later. Facebook now
has more than 800 million users
around the world and is expected
to pass 1 billion later this year.
With that growth, Facebook has
steadily increased its share of the
rapidly expanding market for on-

‘line advertising —— emerging as a S
powerful rival to older, established '
Internet companies like Yahoo and_

Google.

Advertisers in the United States
alone spent $36 billion to reach
online audiences in 2011, up from
$26 billion in 2010, according to
the research ﬁrm eMarketer. The
ﬁrm estimates Facebook’s share of
that revenue grew from 4.6 percent
in 2010 to 6.4 percent in 2011.

Google still dominates the U.S.
ad market, with an estimated share

of nearly 41 percent. But analysts.

say Facebook poses a greater threat
than those numbers suggest, since
its users represent a captive audi-

“walled garden” of sites, outside
the reach of Google’s search en-
gine. ’

With its “Like” button and a
host of other ways to determine
users’ hobbies, interests and pref-
erences, Facebook offers the ability
to reach a highly targeted audience,
Internet analyst Martin Pyykkonen
of Wedge Partners wrote in a re-

port this week. At the same time,

he noted, a majority of Facebook

‘users are in the 18- to 49-year-old
age group, which is coveted by the —

same big advertisers that use tele-

vision to reach mass audiences.
Facebook also has a growing

source of revenue from its “Face—

book Credits” virtual currency, *

which people use to buy services
that run on Facebook’s network,

such as items for Zynga’s popular

social games like “FarmVille” and
“CityVille.”

ALBUM REVIEW

Byjeff Ihaza
Staﬂ” Writer
Born_to Die
Interscope
Grade: B- ’

Rocks Like: Adele’s less talented younger

sister '

The mostly unwarranted hatred toward Lana
Del Rey stems from somethingithe singer
did incredibly well. The music video for her
single “Video Games” was good enough to
capture plenty of people’s attention. The
problem arose when indie music blogs dis-
covered Del Rey’s backstory and deemed her
“fake,” a hipster-
pandering prod-
uct of a wealthy
father and a
spoiled upbring-
ing. The singer
didn’t improve
matters by de-
scribing herself
as a “gangster
Nancy Sinatra”
in an MTV in-
terview. But the
brouhaha sur-‘
rounding her ﬁ-
nancial situation
has no bearing
on her music.
Lana Del Rey’s
debut album, V
Born to Die, is a solid contribution to the
indie—pop genre.

Despite being featured in a stunningly
awful “Saturday Night Live” performance,
which Del Rey bombed with ﬂat singing,
the album is vocally outstanding. Her husky
voice croons steadily throughout each song,
almost like a 1940s lounge singer in a smoky
piano bar. The instrumental production is
a quiet but effective complement, serving
its purpose as a prop to her voice. The end
result blends big-budget production with
indie—pop sensibilities, making tracks such
as “Born to Die” likely radio hits, much like

 

  Haters don't ruin Lana Del Rey’s first album 

Adele’s “Rolling in the Deep.”

The two songs she’d previously released,
“Blue Jeans” and “Video Games,” are the
album’s strongest. The slow—paced instru-
mental and vocalization of “Blue_]eans” belie
turbulent lyrics about rejection and love:
“Promise you’ll remember that you’re mine
/ Baby can you see through the tears?”

Lyrically, Del Rey’s perspective comes
from a rather speciﬁc demographic. The
singer had a privileged upbringing in Lake
Placid, and her music doesn’t attempt to
fake a more edgy life a la Rick Ross. The

album chronicles the love stories of rich kids '

who still managed to get into trouble with
songs such as “National Anthem,” which is
about teenage lovers going to the Hamptons’:
' Though there’s nothu.
ing inherently wrong
with writing about
what you know, now
is not a good time to
be ﬂaunting wealth:
National ire against
the 1 percent is ris=.

music critics grounds
to ﬁnd her music dis.-'
tasteﬁil. But Del Rey’-s
wealth should not be
held against her; she
has a great voice and
the resources to make
people hear it.

Of course, wealth
can’t buy a perfect al-
bum. Despite a few
standouts, the songs generally have too
much editing and too little substance. Cli-
che-ﬁlled “Radio” and “Carmen” do nothing
but add fuel to her detractors’ ﬁre by lament-

MCT Campus

ing rich girl problems. The album’s attempt -

at a conventional pop hit, “Summertime,
Sadness,” falls ﬂat with its uninspired hoo
and overbearing production. L
Nonetheless, the intense criticism Del
Rey has received will likely add to the
singer’s buzz. For an album with this much
talk surrounding it, “Born to Die” is a well-
crafted debut for a singer with an undenii
able future. I V

  FOOTBALL

Newest Pantherclass finalized with 16 recruits %

By Sean Corrado
Stajfwriter

‘lihe Pitt footballteam welcomed

the 16 newest Panthers on

National Signing Day Wednesday
morning, and new head coach
Paul Chryst was, as expected,

- nothing but excited.

 -Rushel Shell, the nation’s
third-best ‘running back
recruit, chalked up enormous

gtats at Hopewell High School

in Aliquippa, "Pa. With .39
consecutive 100-yard .. rushing
games, 9078 careeryards and 110
career touchdowns, Shell holds
records at the national, state

* and division levels, respectively.

Coming off a senior year in high
school in which he scor.e.d-.28,

touchdowns, Shell appears; to;
be comfortable heading 
Bitt’s campus as the 10"f’o‘vera1l ‘A

prospect in the nation.

, b “He knew Pitt was the place

for him long beforewe contacted
him,” Chryst said. “He is going to

. get his opportunities.”

Quarterback Chad Voytik

.— who threw for over‘ 5,000

yards, in an elite career with
Tennessee’s Cleveland High
School — was the ﬁrst to sign
Wednesday morning. Rivals
rated Voytik the best overall
prospect in Tennessee and the
1siation’s fourth best “pro—style”
quarterback. Chryst described
him as a quarterback who “gets
it’? and “has the intangibles of a
winning quarterback.” O

—i “He’l1 a get‘ opportunities. It’ll
Lie interesting,” Chryst said when
asked about Voytik’s playing time
in the near future.

Pittsburgh’s wide receiver-
corps —— which is losing no
graduating‘ seniors — welcomes
twin brothers Demitrious and
Chris Davis to the "mix. The
brothers hail from Austintown
FitchHighschoolinnortheastern
Ohio. Demitrious —— who played’

uarterbackfor Fitch ——- was a

,000—yard passer and rusher ‘

is junior season but only played
ree games his senior year
ecause of a knee injury.

Chris played as a receiver
and a defensive back in high
rchool. Catching passes from
is brother, he racked up nearly

s PO  TS

750 all—purpose yards his junior
year. Both Davis brothers led
Fitch to a 10-2 season and were
ranked in the top 40 players in
Ohio by Rivals. Chryst welcomed
the Davis’ ability to perform at
different positions and said he
is going to ﬁnd a lot of ways’ they
can contribute to the team.
Offensive lineman Adam
Bisnowaty — who grew up 15
miles awayfromPittandattended
Fox Chapel High School -9- was
ranked the nation’s 19th—best
tackle. Bisnowaty and Wisconsin
recruit Gabe Roberts look to
improve a large weakness on the
offensive side of the ball, where
the Panthers line let through the
most sacks in the NCAA last year
with 63. 1 i — ‘
_ Tight end 5].’P. Holtz rounds
‘out the offensive recruits. Holtz

tight end by Scout —— playeid
several positions in high school,
including quarterback," running
back and punter. 7

r~ “We think he ﬁts into.

everything you want in a tight
end,” Chryst said.

‘ Holtz always found a way
into the end zone, scoring 15
touchdowns his senior season.

The defensive side of the ball
can look forward to a large group
of players to add to a secondary
that is losing two seniors next
year. ‘

Safeties Barn Bradley and
Deaysean Rippy are joined with
defensive backs Trenton Coles,
Ryan Lewis andjahmahl Pardner
to provide depth on the passing
defense. Bradley joins his older
brother, freshman Nicholas
Grigsby, on the Panthers’
defensive squad. .

Each new defenseman was
ranked in the top 40 players in

‘ his respective state, and Rippy

was also listed as the nation’s
18th—best outside linebacker.
Linebackers Mike Caprara and
Devon Porchia come together
to solidify and add depth to the
position.

Porchia ~ ranked‘ the 20th '

best prospect in Maryland by
Rivals —— was a three—year starter
at linebacker for the Gilman
School and Caprara was selected

to Pennsylva.nia’s All—State Class '

AAAA while playing at Woodland

 



Hills.
Defensive end Terrell Jackson
racked up 20 sacks in his senior

season at Marion-Franklin.
Chryst described ]ackson’s
6—foot-3, 285-pound physique as
a “big body that can run.”
Jackson’s body is paired up
with that of another end from

' Ohio, Darryl Render. The 27th-

best prospect in Ohio was a part
of St. Edward’s perfect season in
2010 and brings his competitive
nature to a line that will be
missing some starters from last
season.

Now that the recruiting class
of 2 012 has oiﬁcially been signed,
Chryst is even more ready to start
sorting things out in the fall.

“If they are ready to help,
they will play,” Chryst said of the
newcomers Wednesday. '

“There are a lot of guys who
won a lot of games. It makes me
more excited.” I

WRESTLING

Panthers begin chase for EWL title, head to Morgomtown

By Dustin Gabler
Stajfwriter

A heavily favored Pitt wrestling squad
will head to Morgantown to take on the
Mountaineers this Saturday.

The coaching staff isn’t putting more
or less stock into the rivalry than they do
other matches. They have stressed to the
team that all Eastern Wrestling League
matches are important, and it shows. Pitt
has won 16 straight ‘duals in conference
play, and the Panthers are favored to be the
EWL champions for the third consecutive
year.

V “We go into every match the same,”
assistant coach Jason Peters said. “It’s just
another match with an EWL opponent. If
we win, we’re one step closer to our goals.
The guys just need to wrestle like they have
all season.”

The Panthers enter the match tied for
ﬁrst in the EWL with Edinboro at a record
of 4-0. West Virginia sits in third place
with a 2-1 conference record.

The rivalry means a lot to the wrestlers
who have been competing against some of
the Mountaineers since high school.

“A lot of the WVU wrestlers are from
the [Western Pennsylvania Interscholastic
Athletic League], or close to it,” junior
Matt Wilps said. “We have been competing

«against these guys since childhood. The

best example is [Pitt junior] Anthony
Zanetta with [WVU’s] Shane Young.”

Young is from Jeannette, Pa., and
faced Zanetta multiple times throughout
their high school years. Zanetta knows
the importance of this rivalry for the
Panthers.

“The rivalry is something we take a lot
of pride in at Pitt,” Zanetta said. “Rivalries
are what make college sports great. We
want to keep our foot on the pedal and not
take it off.”

‘£96 Friday’s match will be the last time the

Panthers leave the Fitzgerald Field House
for a EWL dual. The team isn’t focusing
on that —— the Panthers view the match as
just another bump in the road that leads to

their ultimate goals.

“I don’t think this being the last away
EWL match has any signiﬁcance,” Zanetta
said. “It is just another opportunity to
better ourselves and see where we stand
this late in the season.” ,

Pitt hasn’t been on the mats since its
victory over Clarion on Jan. 20. Having
had more than two weeks off between the
matches, the Panthers will come into the
Backyard Brawl more prepared than they
do most matches.

“The two weeks of preparation will help
us in the coming match,” Wilps said. .

With the time off, Pitt has also gotten
healthy and practiced some small aspects
of their technique to grow as a team.

“The two weeks off was much needed
for the team and myself,” Zanetta said. “It
gives everyone a chance to heal up a little
and work on some things that we needed
to change.”

The Mountaineers have no wrestlers
ranked in the top 20 of any weight class ——

but rankings don’t mean anything to the
Panther squad. ’

“As a team, we don’t think about
rankings,” Zanetta said.

“We want to go out every match the
same way. We want to wrestle as hard as
we can.”

A win over the Mountaineers will put
the Panthers at 5-0, with a shot at another
EWL title in two weeks when Edinboro
comes to Pittsburgh. I

titles. He was also’ elected into the House
of Representatives in the 15”‘ Congress of
the Philippines in May 2010.

Boxing used to reign as the country’s
top sport, with its athletes reveling in
global attention. With the rise of mixed

“He asked about a 50-50 split, and I
told him, ‘No that can’t happen, but what
can happen is you can make more money
ﬁghting me than you have made in your
whole career,”’ Mayweather said -in an
email to Sportscenter. “I also let him know
I’m in control on my side, but he needs to
get on the same page with his promoter, so
we can make this ﬁght happen.”

And that’s when the most lucrative ﬁght
in boxing history died .-— and possibly the
sport with it.

To be honest, I don’t actually believe
that the sport is going to die, but the
argument could be made. These ﬁghters,
both on the wrong side of 30, are the top
two names in boxing.

Mayweather is an undefeated 42-0
ﬁghter and currently holds the World
Boxing Council welterweight (140—147
pounds) title and is a ﬁve-division world
champion and winner of seven world

martial arts and the decline of mega—stars
in the sport, boxing needs a ﬁght like this
to gain relevance once again. In the past,
the greatest champions fought all comers,
no matter the purse or opponent. Today,
boxers are simply putting money before
pride and not vice versa. Boxing’s pulse is
dropping, and the Mayweather-Pacquiao
ﬁght would serve as the deﬁbrillator,
jump—starting the sport and deﬁning the
ﬁghters’ legacies. ' ~

Mayweather could retire undefeated,
and people would say years from now,
“Yeah, but he didn’t ﬁght Pac—Man.”
Pacquiao could retire to life as a politician
and people would ask, “Why didn’t you
agree to the blood test?”

Muhammad Ali fought Sonny Liston,
Joe Frazier and George Foreman. These
two present-day ﬁghters need to shut
up and ﬁght each other, for our sake, the
sport’s sake and their own sakes. ﬂ
