“on the conditions -in the official life

mid-semester. dance in the Heinz
House, Friday night. The committee
in charge has been atwork the past

i"‘POLITAS” AND “lDlOTAS”
THE BOOK FLOOD

 

 

By Herman I. Arenson

Always, ideas give Way to factss in
this practical world of ours. “Stu-
dgnts" Thoughts,” no exception, gave
way last week to an" abundance of
news. ’ ‘E

alt It all ,
Oncewe wereprone to remark that
and‘ woman to be segregated during
the time that they attend school. Man
would pay more attention to his work
and woman equally so if there were
no members of the opposite sex near
them to disturb their interest.
Recently Mrs. Anna C. Spencer,
speaking before the Institute of Arts
and Sciences of C_o1umbia University,

would be smaller if young men and
young women attended co-ed. schools.
J “Too many women don’t marry slm~
ply because» they have nothad the op-
portunity to see men at the time they
should have—-atythe college age,” be-
1ieves‘Mrs.A Spencer. ‘ V ’_

Here we have a new‘ angle ‘to the
valueof co-education. Is, the fact that
_a small percentage of Wellesly grad-
uates ever enter into m'arital_relation-
ship due to the fact that We-llesly is
not 3; co-educational school? I

’ 0 o 0

Mrs. Spencer says, first, that there
is a smaller percentage of divorces in
localities where. co-education is pres-
em and second, that women who do
not ‘attend co-ed’. schools ma.-rry sel-
dom in comparison to their less off-
standish sisters.‘ .

Do girls become tolerant towards
men because they see them during the
collegeage? Does the presence of
women in class rooms make men
more tolerant towards women?

Does going to school with members
of the ‘opposite sex help one to under-
stand the peculiarities, the individual
characteristics of the other, or meth-
ods for adjusting the life of man to

that of woman and vice versa?
'0 t in '

Present day thinkers ‘bewail the
paucity of marriages among women
college graduates. Is the scarcity of
college graduate wives due to the fact
that they did not attend co-education
al schools? ’

Association with anyone tends to
help one understand that person. It
is true that girls attending school at
which men are also in attendance, as-
sociate more with the members of the
opposite sex andiiso have as greater
opportunity to understand them: On
that basis a co-educational training
may tend to restrain divorce.

,- The women who meets more men
undoubtedly has a greater chance of
getting married. Co-education, in that
viewpoint, does tend to make more
married women out of college'grad-

uates.

poses and to create a place for the
mating of men and ‘women, co-_educa-
tion should he insisted upon in any
edu'ca.tio'nal.po‘iicy. But strangely, col-
leges do not exist for the -purpose
of relieving parents of their daughters
or furnishing wives for their sons.
however much it may seem that such
a case is true.

_ Colleges exist to teach. and to learn.
Toincre-ase the amount of knowledge"
in he world so that a better under-

, , standing of the life we live will help
A us to live it proﬁtably, is the reason

universities are built and not to cor-'
rect any singlesocial maladjustment
as marriage or divorce. I

’ V 0. O ‘O .-

ln ‘Athens. of old there were onlv
two classes of ~citizens——the “politas”,
or man taking an active interest in the
state and politics, and the “idiotas”,
or "private person, taking no active‘

‘ political interest.

From the word “idiotas”, or_Va per~
sonhaving, no interest .in the group, .
political or social,-which "he belongs,
comes the word idiot. . ‘

Plainly, there are too many stu-
dents of the idiot class at Pitt. Un-
interested in university affairs, many
——too many--have created at ‘Pitt an
“idibtas” class.
