Trent Do, the fraternity’s president, said
that he had not yet received a copy of the rul-
ing and that Delta Sigma Phi would call a
lawyer and appeal the decision to Robert
Gallagher, interim’ vice chancellor for stu-
dent affairs.

The sanctions stem from a party which
was reported on Aug. 26 at the oﬂ°-campus

Dennis Donham, assistant vice chancellor
for student affairs, decided on the actions and
said that the restrictions were not as harsh

MTV brought its “Choose or Lose” bus
to Pitt’s campus as a stop on its nationwide
tour of colleges and universities to help regis-

Despite the overcast weather, hundreds
of students gathered around the bus and reg-

“The media that MTV brings itself

Torn Kirby. “They make it so easy _to vote.”

Kyle Millar, production coordinator

Do said that the only wrongdoing was
in having an unauthorized party, one that had
not been registered with the IFC. He said that
he did not know that parties over the summer
had to be registered.

Donham said that Do admitted that
freshmen were in the house and that alcohol
was being served. Donham said that it was
“not clear” if anyone underage was actually
given alcohol, but that it_ was against regula-
tions for freshmen to be in the house if any
alcohol was present.

Around the World

MOSCOW —— President Boris Yeltsin’s
heart illness, which his doctors have
revealed to be a more serious condition
than previously known, has fueled a fresh
and increasingly intense struggle among
leading politicians who would like to suc-
ceed him.

Although Yeltsin may survive by—pass
surgery and return as the vigorous leader
he once was, his rivals have begun behav-
ing as if his days are numbered. They seem
to be preparing for a re—run of the leader-
ship struggle that was seemingly settled
only two-and-a-half months ago when
Yeltsin won a second four-year term. '

The Russian constitution calls for a
new election within three months if the
president suffers a “sustained inability due
to health to discharge his powers.”
Yeltsin’s planned heart by-pass surgery has
been suggested to be delayed by his doctor,
Renat S. Akchurin, because of his fragile
condition. Washington Post

2 Monti and local merchants
  dedicate fundraiser to Cecil

THE PITT NEWS ' 3

For University Authorized Travel

.—

Oakland businesses have helped
raise over $28,000 for Kevin Cecil,
the former Pitt student who was
crippled in a shooting over a year
ago.

Chris Monti, 39, owner of the
Touch of Gold jewelry store on
Forbes Avenue, has been an active
member of the Oakland Business
and Civics Association for the past
year, and has primarily been in
charge of organizing fund-raisers
for Cecil.

Cecil, 22, who lives at home in
Boiling Springs, Pa., has been a
quadriplegic since he was shot in
the back of the neck by 16-year-old

‘Bruce Cabbagestalk in front of

Webster Hall in July of 1995.

In January it was Monti’s idea
to change the OBCA’s change col-
lecting campaign, called “Change
for the Better” and first geared
towards the homeless, into a fund-
raiser for Cecil.

“I read an article about Kevin,
and it was asking for support in
raising money for him, and I want-
ed to help,” Monti said. '

Along with the change collect-
ing cans, Monti organized a golf
outing last May.

Golf enthusiasts from all over
the area showed their support by
donating $75 in exchange for 18
holes of golf followed by a cook-
out that was held at Monti’s home.

Monti and the OBCA worked
with the Food Services department
at Pitt when planning the golf out-
mg.
“I had 150 people come back to
my house for a cook-out afterwards,
and that’s where the University
pulled through,” Monti said.

Pitt supplied the tables, donated
all of the food, and, according to
Monti, saved the OBCA a lot of
money.

For another fundraiser, a friend
of Monti’s, who works for NBC in
New York, was able to get two
Super Bowl tickets to this season’s
game, which were then entered into
a rafﬂe contest that raised $10,000
for Cecil.

Monti explained that with the
help from Pitt and the UPMC, NBC
and other businesses, the OBCA
raised $28,000 for Cecil.

“We were very grateful. It gave
us that extra cushion needed to pro-
vide Kevin with the things he
needs,” said Barbara Cecil, Kevin’s
mother.

Monti and the OBCA continue
to raise money for Kevin Cecil with
the “Change for the Better” cam-
paign and plan another golf outing
for next May.

For this year’s golf outing, par-
ticipants donate $100 in exchange
for a round of golf, their own golf
cart, and, once again, the cook-out.
Of the $100 that participants
donate, $60 goes straight to help
Cecil.

“We had to turn people away
from the last outing, so if people
are interested, they should get
involved now,” Monti said.

Recently, Cecil expressed his
gratitude towards Chris Monti and
to‘ the golf outing.

“It was such a great help and it
was great to see the community
come out and support me the way
they did,” Cecil said. '

Cecil is staying in good health
and is still pursuing a degree from
the School of Engineering. He
hopes to return to Pitt full time next
September. 2

Online service aids students in job hunts

 

If you feel the frustration that
comes with trying to find a job in
today’s competitive market, then look
into the new free service provided on
the Internet.

StudentCenter.com is designed to
assist graduating seniors towards
finding a good—paying job right out of
school.

“This service is here to take anxi-
ety out of job searching and career
planning,” said StudentCenter
President Eve Yohalem.

The program is an Internet search
tool that provides graduating students
with a database of approximately
35,000 companies in 1,000 different

industries across the country and
around the world. The companies sub-
mit requests for summer and full
employment from all ‘fifty states and
thirty foreign countries.
StudentCenter.com also provides
interactive programs for students who
are unsure about their field of interest,
or need help with interview skills.
“Access to our service was delib-
erately setup to be easy, allowing any
student to access it,” Yohalem said.
Passwords and other codes are not
needed to use the service, allowing a
free flow of information to the stu-
dent. All a student needs is the
a d d r e s s ,
http2//www.studentcenter.com.
The program also comes with a
quality control system of approxi-

mately 150 career counselors from
across the country who take sugges-
tions and comments from people
using the service.

Within the next few weeks,
StudentCenter.com plans to imple-
ment a new design for their program
based on these suggestions, making
the service even easier for students to
use.

The newest item in the service is a —

bulletin board system that lists places
for students and graduates to chat
with career counselors about future
job possibilities. Interactive practice
job interviews are also being added.
Pitt students can access the pro-
gram 24 hours a day, seven days a
week from the computing labs or any
computer with a web browser.

Counselors help overe)denclecl credit users get back on track

We see them constantly looking
for new blood, offering free perks
such as toys, goody bags and ugly T-
shirts. They represent various credit
card companies and they’re desper-
ate for college students.

Many students fall into the trap
that ends in credit debt. The National
Credit Counseling Service is aware
of the surge of debt among college
students and is out to help students
out of credit debt.

The counseling service is a non-
profit organization which has

enrolled over 22,000 individualsin »

their Debt Management Program.
Many are college students with
extreme financial hardship due to
poor credit.

“We have counseling services for
people who have overextended them-
selves financially,” said Laurie
Mitroff, spokeswoman for the coun-
seling service. “We also have con-
sumer education because bankrupt-
cies are the highest ever.”

A recent study states that 64 per-
cent of college students have credit
cards, and representatives from
almost every credit card company
frequent hundreds of colleges across
the country.

“The [credit] companies figure

- late fees.

that college students, after four or six
years, will be potentially great cus-
tomers,” according to Diane
Williams, a credit specialist for The
First National Bank of Chicago.

But many of those students fall
into debt too soon and too fast. Once
that happens students can go to the
counseling service who will work
with the creditors to establish a
monthly pay-
ment, petition
for less inter-
ests, and nego-
tiate terms to
stop constant

“We find
that the credi-
tors are usually
q u i t e
a m e n a b 1 e , ”
said Mitroff. 

Once a student becomes the
proudowner of a new credit card, he
should keep in mind “The Seven
Signals of Credit Overextension,” as
submitted by the NCCS:

0 Exceeding debt limits and credit
limits ’ .
0 Using credit cards in place of cash
- Paying only the minimum amount
due on a bill

- Skipping credit payments

- Requesting new credit cards and
increasing limits

  

° Unable to handle small emergen-
cies

- Unaware of what you owe versus
what you earn

"‘But when approached by com-
panies, look for the lowest interest
rates, a card with no annual fee, the
company that gives the most time
between payments, and it is always
good to find a company with 24-hour
customer ser-
vice,” according
to Williams.

Williams also
said to avoid
companies with
over—the-limit
and late fees.

Mitroff said,
. “Students should
be careful about

how many card
. offers they
accept. They should also be careful
with the purchases and make sure
that they have the money to back
them up.”

Bad credit can severely hurt a
student later in life because many
landlords and employers check a
future tenant or employee’s record.

“Bad credit is more detrimental
then no credit,” Mitroff said.

The counseling service advises
students to always pay more then the
minimum portion of their bill. That

amount only covers the interest of
the bill, and leaves the actual pur-
chases collecting more interest in the
coming month.

“Also, don’t take cash advances
because there is a fee that the cus-
tomer is charged immediately and
finance charges accumulate daily
without a grace period,” Williams
said.

The service is hoping to educate
more students about credit cards in
the months ahead, and expand its
inﬂuence throughout more college
campuses.

“We began to receive calls asking
for help from more and more college
students, and we thought that if they
were aware beforehand, then they
would not have gotten into debt,”
said Mitroff “I am looking into visit-
ing campuses during their freshman
orientations. to tell students about
late fees, grace periodsand budget-
ing.”

If you think that you may be
overextending yourself financially,

‘the NCCS suggests getting control of

income and expenses, stop using
credit cards, don’t apply for new
cards, and discuss the use of credit
cards with family.

If you are in debt or would like
more information about credit cards

and debt you can contact the service

We didn’t get celebrities, but there
were at least 1,013 newly-registered
voters yesterday after MTV brought its

“Choose or Loose”
Oakland.

That figure ranks Pitt with the
third—highest registration rate of all the
schools MTV has visited in the past
year, falling behind Michigan State
with 1,096, and the University of
‘Massachusetts with 1,026.

“A lot of it depended on the weath-
er. More people might have come out if
it was a nice day,” said Andrew
Wuertele, SGB president. “Besides that
we have already registered a lot of stu-
dents. We’re all happy with the turn out
we got.”

Shanna Blau, chair of SGB’s voter
registration campaign said 200 students
registered to vote last Friday alone, but
yesterday’s event signiﬁcantly boosted
the interest among students.

“People didn’t really seem too
hyped about it until we L
got MTV to come,” Blau said. “We
were pretty successful getting help
from the students for [the “Choose or
Loose” bus].”

The SGB is now planning to bring
political issues to the attention of the
student body in the months to come.

Rain or shine, SGB and MTV register 1,013 volers

“It isn’t enough that students regis-
ter, they need to understand why they
vote” said Blau. “The reason why peo-
ple don’t vote is they don’t know the
issues, and don’t know the candidates.”

City Councilman Bob O’Connor
was also on hand to view the festivities
and help register students to vote.

“Students should get more involved
with their government, if not on a daily
basis then a routine basis,” O’Connor
said. “Students should come down [to
the city county building] and voice their
concerns. We as community leaders
really need their input.”

O’Connor said students should
realize the potential and power their
vote holds.

“One voice means a lot more than
people think. Activists have too much
say, and average people don’t voice
their opinion enough,” O’Connor said.
“Elected officials need a cross section.”

tor with MTV, said the most important

involved in the political process is an
understanding of the electoral system.

According to Millar, MTV and the
“Rock the Vote” organization have been
developing programs that break down
the voting process into its basic ele-
ments to educate people on how an
election works. .

“MTV has been running shows that

specifically deal with issues like ‘What
is a caucus?’ ‘What is a primary?’ Once
students understand what these are
they’ll see why they need to get
involved,” Millar said. “These pro-
grams help a lot of other people too. It
isn’t just young people, who don’t
understand the process of voting. My
parents were watching these programs,
too.”

In his travels from school to school,
Millar said he’s seen a lot more student
involvement and interest in politics
since the last election.

“Students are also following the
issues more closely,” he said.
Education, student aid and grants are
always at the top of their interest, but
they also are concerned about crime
and the job market.”

Conversely, Jaime Uzeta, national
coordinator for “Rock the Vote,” said
the politicians he’s met traveling the
country are becoming more aware of
young voters and are more considerate
of the issues effecting them.

“Bob Dole gets a lot of criticism for
not identifying with young voters, but
he treats them as regular Americans,”
Uzeta said. “He talks about welfare
reform and taxes. He mentions the
same issues to a crowd of students as he
does at other rallies.”

Uzeta said President Clinton focus-
es more directly on young voters, than
the Republican candidate.

“Clinton discusses issues like stu-
dent loans and student aid,” Uzeta said.
“He targets young people. Which is
ﬁne. It’s important to focus on those
issues.” '

Millar and Uzeta both said they feel
the MTV involvement has boosted stu-
dents interest in the upcoming election,
and said they hope student voters
demonstrate their inﬂuence at the polls.

“People say that there is a lot of stu-
dent apathy when it comes to the elec-
tions, but that’s true of any generation,”
Millar said. “There’s apathy in older
people, too  It all depends on who has
faith in the power of their vote.”

Donham said that the training program
will help root out problems with leadership
and the delegation of responsibility within
the chapter. The fraternity oﬂicers will have
a chance to work with executives from the
national chapters.

“[The training program] will ensure that

selves.”

The party, which was not n1sh—related,
was reported to Student Activities by the
IFC. Rush, a period of alcohol—free activi-
ties, had not begun by the date of the party.

“The IFC regards themselves as a
watchdog to keep everybody honest,”
Donharn said. “They have some concerns
about credibility with regards to alcoho .”

Under the new Greek Imperative rules
armounced this summer, f1rst—semester
freshmen would not have been eligible for
fratemity rush anyway, but earlier this
month, that policy was revised. Now, the
policy allows ﬁeshmen to rush a fraternity

, beginning in October.

‘ However, the policy states that fresh-
men must complete an eight-week educa-
tional program before they can enter a fra-
ternity. The policy states that there can be no
rush activities in December, in order to leave
students tirrre to study for ﬁnals. The combi-

Donharn also said that he was con-
cerned about Delta Sigma Phi members
having to “mend some fences” with other
fraternities for having an unfair advantage
by holding a party so close to the opening of
rush.

Last year, six fraternities faced sanc-
tions, and four of them had their charters
revoked for a year or more. Phi Kappa
Theta, Phi Gamma Delta, Sigma Phi
. Epsilon, Alpha Epsilon Pi, and Kappa Alpha
 Psi faced hazing charges. Zeta Beta Tau’s

Register to vote even if
for none of the above

Yesterday, we saw the lines of students registering to vote at

5 the MTV Choose or Lose bus. We saw students as well as local
I elected ofﬁcials clustered around the bus making rhetoric about

how important and great it is to vote in a democratic society.

We wholeheartedly agree that it is is important and great to
vote, and we hope that you will all go out and do so, but...

First of all, we shouldn’t need MTV to come and tell us to
Vote. In a democracy, it is not only our right, but also our respon-
sibility to vote. To vote responsibly, one must be fully aware of
what and whom one is voting.for. If you are going to vote sim-
ply because MTV has told you that it was cool, and you want to
be cool by MTV’s standards, please don’t.

As much as we respect those who go out and vote because
it is their duty, there is more to it than just an obligation to pull a
lever and to go out with your friends for a beer and brag about
what a great citizen you are. There is no point in voting if you

 aren’t going to put a little work into ﬁnding out what you are
3 voting for. If it is, a race in which there is an incumbent, check
j out the incumbent’s voting record. Also, check out what the
I challenger has to say. Vote informed; really make a difference in

who our leadership is. Know the facts before you step into the
booth.

If you don’t like any of the candidates, don’t vote for the
least despicable of the lot. Simply vote for “None of the above.”
The only way to effect change is to let the current regime know
that you’re just not satisﬁed with the pitiful candidates that they
throw your way, and that you aren’t going to take it lying down.

If you vote for what you don’t want, people are going to mistake p

it as being all right. If things are unacceptable, say so.

Whether you vote or not, registering in itself is a statement.
It says that you care enough to take the time out to ﬁll out the
forms. It lets people know that you are paying attention. There

j is a record of people who are registered and don’t vote.
‘ Registering does make a difference.

Please try to make’ the most out of this opportunity which
democracy allows us. Educate yourself, and vote with your con-
science.

The rumors of the death of
sex are greatly exaggerated.
However, it is suffering from an
undisclosed illness and living qui-
etly in seclusion. In fact, it is
rather like me. Some of my col-
leagues at this newspaper have
bemoaned AIDS and addiction as
their unhappy post—punk, post-
hippy lot, leaving them only the
dull legacy of safe sex and tobac-
co (yawn) cigarettes.

Once upon a time, in a far-
away land, when the Iron Lady
ruled and The Blockheads sang,
“sex and drugs and rock’n’roll/is

_ all my brain and body need,” ‘lived

two silly girls who read Germaine
Greer and “The Electric Kool Aid
Acid Test.” The girls took this odd
combination of culture and poli-
tics and fashioned a fonnula for
life which they followed for sev-
eral drug-crazed years.

The results of this experience
can be summarized brieﬂy as fol-
lows: Cocaine makes you horny
but incapable. (Endless tussling
around in some strange bed.)

' Heroin makes you puke and not

care if you ever have sex again
(Endless pukings in some strange
toilet). Acid makes you unable to
concentrate on anything except
“Wow man, did you ever really
look at the moon? It looks just like
another planet or something.”
Speed makes the inside of your
mouth resemble a cesspit —- plus
it makes your brain feel just like
an egg on drugs, plus you don’t
have time to do anything because

Sex might I)

e down, but

your so busy rushing about look-
ing for somebody whose got some
downers so you can crash and
stop this dreadful nightmare.
Downers: now there is an ideal
drug for sex orgies; however, I
can’t seem to remember much
about that, except that once I
woke up with some strange penis
attempting to locate the reciprocal
part of my anatomy,‘ and the stereo
was blasting Johnny Rotten,
screaming, “No Future!”

After a couple of years of this
sort of thing, one day _I happened
upon a mixture of drugs which
resulted in a marvellous feeling so
like not having taken any drugs at
all thatl decided to go straight. So,
I married a tall, handsome straight
guy in a uniform and he carried
me off to America and put me in a
white clapboard house with a
picket fence.

After a couple of years of that
sort of thing, I woke up and real-
izedithadallbeenadreamandl
was back in Kansas. Well,
Pittsburgh in my case, speciﬁcal-
ly, in the newsroom of our ﬁne
publication, racking the remains
of my brains for a sexy topic to
write about. “How about sex?”
said my editor.

“Wow,” I said. “That must be
why they pay you the big buc .”

“Here, look at this,” he said,
and a ﬂyer from Playboy was
bragging about its 1996 college
sex survey with a headline which
screamed, “Campus relationships
are longer, stronger, and kinkier.”
My colleague and I (I reluctantly
admit) immediately fell for this
alluring headline, and we rushed

out and spent $5 of his money on
a copy of Playboy, safely encased
in its shrink-wrapped condom
wrapper thing. The shop lady
carded us. “How old do you have
be?” I asked.

“Eighteen,” she responded

with implacable boredom.

We rushed back up to the
newsroom and fell to reading with
bated breath. Which was exhaled
with large yawns when we real-
ized that a bunch of ﬁgures reveal-
ing frequency and duration of this
or that activity was pretty dull. It
is, perhaps, ironic, that as college
students we had to pay $5 to redis-
cover this, especially since we
already paid for Intro to Statistics.

The most likely candidates
for some gratuitous thrills, the
actual quotes of real people, pro-
vided nothing more exciting than
this: “‘I hate when the guy just
wants to put it_ inside me for a
minute before he uses the rubber,”
says a Michigan State undergrad.
“It is uncomfortable to have to say
‘no’ when you’re trying to do
something romantic.”

It puzzles me she chose the
word “romance.” I think that
romance is the antithesis of sex.
“Webster.’s” deﬁnes romance as
“pleasant and imaginative but not
practical. Not based in fact.” Well,
I guess there is nothing wrong

with using romance to cover up n

the harsh realities of life.—- such
as sex. In which case it plays a
similar role such as that provided
by alcohol or drugs, which only
goes to show that today’s college
students must be a lot smarter than

Mbiiey, \to you we offer a prayer for
Thanksgiving: _

Oh Sovereign One, we entreat upon
you for our sustenance and contentment!
We are humbled by your omnipotence, He
who hast transcended the power of His cre-
ators. Thou who hast shaped our being, You
are our savior, we shall want for nothing.

strengths? His weaknesses? To implement
any measure of relaxation on our dependen-
cy on Money would represent a change in

v the capitalist paradigm Ideally, such a

reform would revolutionize America for the
better, improving our overall standard of liv-
ing and broadening our basis for living.

But Americans have a fetish for »

Money, analogous to a drugaddiction. We

trade Him, stock Him, ﬁght for Him, and’

live for Him. Without Him, we are destitute
and sick, casualties of withdrawal.
However, therein lies one clear distinction
as far as this analogy is concerned: In our
society, the exploitation of Money is accept-
able, and more than that, fashionable. As a

community we are hooked on Money, to the - I
' extent that attaining Him" has largely

become our basis for living, and such that an
inadequate attainment is a conderrmation o
indigence. '
The interdependency of Money and the
American Dream is striking. Generally, the
preeminent aims of the American Dream
are attaining a high standard of living and
perhaps a family. Under our capitalist
framework, realizing these goals is depen-
dent upon achieving ﬁnancial

“Money, to You we offer a prayer for

' This seemingly sardonic statement
should not be taken quite as lightly as it
seems. While money ought not to be held
up as some kind of graven image, it ought to
be recognized for its true value.

Money does indeed have some tran-
scendent power. It allows people to tran-
scend the narrow constraints of the barter
system, which means they can transcend a
lifestyle which is based solely on what they
produce.

Money is an abstraction, a medium of
exchange. It is concrete only in its physical
existence. The power of money is that it lib-
erates us from the lengthy business of bar-
tering. In order to make a deal with some-
one, we no longer have to give them a

Does money have an ever-expanding
inﬂuence over people’s lives? It is not
money that has an inﬂuence, it is those who
use the symbol of money to misdirect the
attention of people. Are we held in bondage
by money? Only if we are so weak—minded
that we fritter our money on trinkets in air-
ports.
Because of the ever—present tendency
to lay blame, it would be remiss not to
address some of the problems attributed to a
lack or excess of money. The problem does
not lie in the currency, which pexiple tend to
be covetous of, but rather the misplaced
importance on the currency.

All you have
to do is dream

 

 

Pitt football fans are still reeling.

Ask a Panther die—hard what two plus
two is, and he’ll say, “eleventy-six.” If there
weren’t so many bridges to choose ﬁom in

— this town, he rrright already have jumped.

Let’s face it — if a tie is like kissing
your sister, then getting beat 72-0 is like your
big brother hitting you over the head with an
aluminum baseball bat. People are hurting
out there.

Those who still have Dan Marino on the
brain are going through the toughest week of
their sports lives. They need a little boost. So,

you haven’t gotten the details yet Once this
plan unravels, it’ll be as crystal clear as
Oliver Stone’s theory on the Kennedy assas-

The plan has a simple, factual basis
behind it — that there is no way the Pitt
Panthers can win the Big East championship
through normal methods, like outplaying the
other seven teams. Based on this season’s
gridiron performance, the plan has a pretty
solid starting point.

Women's soccer wins first game

Panthers beat
Wagner, 4-2

 
 

The Lady Panthers soccer team played
what was probably the best game in their
short history on Monday night against the
Wagner Lady Seahawks. Pitt made school
history by winning their ﬁrst game ever
after two overtime periods, 4-2. With their
ﬁrst—ever victory, the Lady Panthers raise
their record to 1-7. .

The Lady Panthers fell behind early,
but their tenacious play lifted them to the
victory. Freshman Mia Mora provided the
highlights, scoring two goals including the
game winner at 96:13.

The ﬁrst half was a see—saw battle for
these two teams. Wagner’s best scoring
chance came early when they kicked a cor-
ner in front and it ﬂoated over the net.
Wagner’s ﬁrst goal came on a tap in by their
offensive star of the night, Cheryl Moore.
Her unassisted goal came when Pitt goal-
keeper Sarah Stout came out of the net to

grab the ball and it slid by her. All. Moore‘

had to do was tap it into the net.

Wagner’s pregame cry was, “Strike
Hard, Strike First” Not only did they strike
ﬁrst, but they also struck second at 26:46.
Just ﬁve minutes after checking into the
game, Felicia Vagnini blooped a pass to
Moore who split the Pitt defense and came
in on Stout all alone. Moore beat Stout to
her right to put the Seahawks up 2-0.

This goal seemed to light a ﬁre under
the Panthers who had two great scoring
chances in the following minutes. Oﬂ' a cor-
ner kick, the ball bounced in front, but Pitt
just could not connect

Finally, after a tripping penalty in the

box, Mora was awarded a penalty shot She
lined it up and shot it to the low right hand
comer of the net Wagner goalie Melissa
Prudente dove and the ball skipped just
wide of her ﬁngertips. It was Mora’s fourth
goal of the season and pulled the Lady
Panthers to wiﬂrin one.

In the beginning of the second half, Pitt
faced a scary moment when three Wagner
offensive players converged and Stout

missed the ball. Fortunately, it scooted wide
of the net ,

Pitt ﬁnally pulled even when Vanessa
Madison slipped a pass to Rachel Bertges

. who broke in alone on the goalie. The keep-

er slid out, and Bertges put it right by her for
her ﬁrst goal of the season.
Madison said, “I was just trying to get

Lax hopes to

an Townsend

After missing the playoffs by only one
win last year, the men’s lacrosse team’s goal
is a playoﬂ’ berth. Pitt ﬁnished last season
with a respectable 10-5 record and a victory
over West Virginia in their ﬁnal game.

“We ended on a good note last year
with the win over WVU, and that feeling
has canied over into this fall,” said Gary
Neﬁ°.

This good feeling stems from Pitt dou-
bling the size of the team ﬁom 20 last sea-
son to 40 players this year. The Panthers
retumed every starter ﬁom last season
except for Dave Walter.

‘This is the one of the biggest teams
I’ve ever seen,” said team captain Pat Shea.
“We had abig turnout and have a lot of

 

pick up where they left off

‘ depth. One of our problems last year was

that we didn’t have enough players to keep
everyone fresh, and now we do, which will
make us a better team.”

Returning starters on defense are cap-
tain John Foris, Mike Domboski and Tom
Evans. In goal, the tandem of John
McGrath and Dave Travis return. The
defense was the backbone of the team last
year, keeping Pitt in most games when the
offense was struggling. All three defense-
men are big with exceptional stick—handling
and checking ability. ‘McGrath and Travis
split time last year in the net. I

The midﬁeld will be lead by captain
Rob Heaps, the leading scorer from last
year. Heaps is often the best player on the
ﬁeld for the Panthers. His experience and
overall skill give Pitt an edge in any game.
Accompanying him will be Shea, who

moved ﬁ'om attack, Pete Choi, and Steve
Love.

‘T switched Matt and Pat because I felt
it would help the team, and it would use
their skills better,” said Neff.

Another reason for improvement in
thisteamisthebetteruseofpracticetime.
Because there are more players this year, the
team is able to scrimmage full ﬁeld, some-
thing they couldn’t do last season. This
helps with conditioning and teamwork.

The fall season of lacrosse starts this
weekend when the team will travel to
Maryland for a tournament The fall is pri-
marily a warm—up for the spring season
since the fall games don’t determine post-
season play. However, they do serve an
important purpose; fall is a time to play as
many players as you can to ﬁnd out who
can play well.

Dandy Dan not so dandy & check out our briefs

from local and wire services

- Pittsburgh Steelers’ kicker Josh
Miller says he’s too sore to kick this
weekend. The Black~and—Gold will
sign a replacement kicker for this
weekend’s match—up against division
rival Houston. Miller has a hernia
which will need surgery. He’ll miss at
least two to six weeks.

° Quarterback Jeff George’s days as a
Falcon may be numbered. Atlanta
Head Coach June Jones suspended
George for this weekend’s contest
against San Francisco for “conduct
detrimental to the team” during
Sunday’s loss to Philadelphia, and has
hinted about trading him in the near
future.

- You think the Dallas Cowboys are in
bad shape right now? The Cowboys
received word yesterday that wide
receiver Kevin Williams is out six to
eight weeks with a foot injury.
Williams sustained the injury in
Sunday’s 10-7 loss to Buffalo.

Barry Switzer and the ‘Boys visit .

the friendly confines of Veterans
Stadium in Philadelphia for a Monday
night match—up with the Eagles.

- NHL forward Brendan Shanahan
made it publicly known that he’s jump-
ing the Hartford Whaler “ship” and
said he wants to be traded. The
Northeast division squad have hinted at
a possible trade. ESPN sources have
reported a possible trade to Detroit
involving center Keith Primeau, who
was suspended for not reporting to
training camp.

0 In what an Idaho State doctor called a
“freak accident,” Bengals’ senior cor-
nerback Marcus Jackson was para-
lyzed from the neck down in this week-
end’s win over Western Montana.
Jackson was making a tackle when he
was hit in the head with a knee, frac-
turing two vertebrae.

- Boston Red Sox pitcher Roger
Clemens was named the American
League player of the week. Clemens
tied his own record last week 4-0 win
over Detroit with 20 strikeouts.

- Cincinnati Reds al1—star Barry
Larkin redefined history Sunday,
becoming the first shortstop ever to hit
30 home runs and steal 30 bases in one
season. To the trivia buffs —— Larkin’s
30th home run came off Cardinals’
pitcher Donovan Osborne.

Larkin is the 17th played to join
the 30-30 club and second infielder to
accomplish the feat. The other? New
York Mets third-baseman Howard
Johnson, who accomplished the feat
three times.

- Former Pitt and current Miami
Dolphin quarterback Dan Marino will
be out at least three weeks due to
Monday night’s injury in Indianapolis.
X—rays at halftime reported that Marino

sprained his right ankle. Bernie Kosar
replaced the Pitt alum in the 10-6 Colts
victory. Miami and the rest of the AFC
East have a bye for week five.

the ball in front and make something hap-
pen.”

She deﬁnitely did, and the Panthers tied
the game. The rest of the game was back and
forth, but the teams remained tied and, by
NCAA rules, Pitt and Wagner would play
two 15-minute overtimes to decide the game.

In the ﬁrst overtime, Megan Beasley
served a comerkick just in front of the
Wagner goal and Mora headed the ball past
Prudente for the eventual game—winning goal
at 96:13. It was her ﬁfth goal of the season
and second of the game. '

Between the ﬁrst and second overtime,
Pitt Coach Roland Sturk told his team to
“chase every runner, go for every ball, win
every ball. That’s gomra be the dilference.”

That’s exactly what the Panthers did as
they scored one more goal to seal the victory.
Stout came up huge in the second overtime,
keeping the Panthers ahead. The only down
side to this game was that Mora and
Elizabeth Schroeck went down with injuries,
the severity of which are not yet known.

After the game, Pitt’s defensive standout
and t1i—captain Heather Ferguson said that all

they did to shut down Moore, who was a
non-factor after a tonid ﬁrst half, was to
‘ ‘Respect her, play off of her and contain her.’ ’

This strategy worked magic for the
Lady Panthers as Moore barely touched the
ball.

Ferguson said about Pitt’s ﬁrst—ever win,
“Oh my God, I can’t even describe it We
work so hard in practice and we win togeth-
er and lose together.”

She continued, “Winning makes it all
worthwhile. We can ﬁnally say, ‘Hey, we
beat you.”’

This sums up the positive attitude of the
entire Pitt sideline. They erupted with excite-
ment as the ﬁnal whistle blew and took their
victory lap around the ﬁeld.

Coach Sturk said, “They work hard and
have been in every game.”

He believes the trademark of the team is
that they never quit. Their goal is to get bet-
ter every game, and if they keep playing like
they did Monday it will be a successful sea-
son. The ladies play at SUNY-Buﬁalo this
Sunday before returning home Oct. 3 against
cross-town rivals Duquesne.

Mia Mora (#5) scored two goals including the game winner. She leads
the team with five goals on the season.

The Pitt News football experts propose solutions to ”The Panther Problem." P them look almost dangerous. Still, the close
. ’ ' v loss could have opened some eyes in the

conference and put the plot in jeopardy.

Enter Ohio State. If losing 72-0 isn’t
enough to get written 011‘ as a bye-weekby
almost anybody, then nothing is. Since any
sane person could tell that the Buckeyes had
the game won at the opening kickoif, it was
the perfect opportunity to re-enforce the
notion that the Pitt Panthers are the doonnats
of the Big East

The facts speak again: In national TV
games, the Panthers have been outscored
106-0. In games without any television cov-
erage, they are outscoring their opponents
87-56. Coincidence?

(By the way, in the spirit of all outra-
geous theories, we’l1 ignore that 52 of those
points came against Kent.)

Then, with a 1-3 record and the rest of
their opponents lulled to sleep, the Panthers
go on a seven-game win streak behind the
golden arm of secret weapon Pete Gonzalez.
They beat Miami with the biggest upset
since David TKO’d Goliath, take the wave
of momentum over Temple, Syracuse, and
Virginia Tech, then top it off with a
Halloween destruction of Boston College in
their ﬁrst national TV win of the season.

Notre Dame suddenly becomes a for-
mality. Rutgers is the ﬁnishing touch to an 8-
3 season. Fans party in the streets;

Along the way, Miami and West.
Virginia each drop to 5-2 in the conference.
Pitt goes to the Orange Bowl and beats Notre
Dame again. More fans party in the streets.
Johnny Majors signs a’ lifetime contract.

So for all of you who bleed blue and
gold, there is still hope. Put this newspaper
down right away, run out and make your
plane reservations for New Year’s in 
Hmry, before they’re all sold out!

Everybody else, welcome back from
Panther fantasy island — a nice place to
visit, but not for this many years in a row.
The real fact is this: With the brand of foot-
ball Pitt is playing right now, they would be
lucky to cover the spread against the RS. 136
Girls’ Auxiliary Marching Band

There are ﬁfth-year seniors on this cam-
pus who don’t know what a winning football
season looks like — that’s a sad commentary
on any program, especially one that 20 years
ago brought this school more notoriety than
anything since the Salk Vaccine. Worse, if
the Hurricanes and the Irish demolish Pitt as
predicted, the team that used to bring stu-
dents national championships will force stu-
dents to wear a fake mustache and a Penn
State sweatshirt when they go home for
Thanksgiving. -

This team used to live up to win-loss
records not unlike the one at the end of the
asinine plot proposed above. Students took
pride in it Now, the most exciting event on
campus is when a street gets closed for 30
days. Something has to be done.

Somebody needs to come up with a real
plan.
