Students Open Library
To Ease Book Shortage

In an attempt to ﬁnd a remedy for the existing shortageiof text-
books, Student Congress has "appointed a committee to set up a

library of the scarce books in the ‘Reserve ‘Book room.
Because of shortages of newsprint and of paper, publishers are

unable to fill completely theorder placed by the University.

There

is no hope that the bookstore will be supplied conipletely with text-
books until sometime near the end of March. Because of this con-

dition, a great many Pittstudentse

have no textbooks. In some of the
six credit courses. there are as few
asone-third of the class who have
books.

Herky Kncll,’p1‘esident of Stu-
dcnt Congress, said, “Unless the
student body cooperates ‘fully by
supporting thisplan, some” stu-
dents are going to find themselves
taking a course without as much
as opening a book.”

Through its emergency plan,

tudent Congress hopes to borrow
enough books from the students to
establish a library of the scarce
textbooks until the book publish-
crs can meet the demand.

Under the plan students may
use necessary textbooks in the li-
brary which would otherwise be
unavailable.

The student committee now is
making a survey to determine
which books are needed. When
the survey has been completed, a
list of the needed textbooks will
be posted on the ground floor bul-
letin board in the Cathedral of
Learning.

Each student in Pitt is urged to
consult the bulletin board some
time after tomorrow and to lend
whatever of the needed books he
hay have. Students will be given
receipts for the books they lend.

“I’d like to stress the urgent de-
mand for these textbooks and the
ﬁne opportunity for upperclass-
men to be of real service to their
fellow students and to the Univer-
sity,” said Robert M. Sullivan, as-
sistant to the dean of men.

Dr.‘J. G. Quick, Registrar, in
staitiiinrg what was " perhaps the
"htishiest 1”e‘gisti:'a'tio11 in the his.ory
of tlie Unive"s‘ity, has released
thefolloiwiiing ‘figures on the mid-
: éh‘r’o1'Iment. .

For "the first day, ‘registration
tﬁéalédi 631; the seconduiday, 1,703;
uthirdifday, 1,676; fourth day, 1,603;
ififith, day, 1,403; Saturday, the ﬁn-
a1, day, registration numbered
 at o’:c1'ock. Thentotal regis-
't'r“_a‘t.ionixvas 8,367.

These ﬁgures, which include the
veterans, was recorded against
the 4,437 in the spring of 1945.

They not "only exceeded last year’s

heavy registration, but all pre-
vious, ones according to Dr. Quick.
He stated, “The largest enroll-
ment in the history of the Uni-
versity was in the year 1930-31.

The spring ‘semester total that;

Year was 7,932 against tiis year’s
8,367. Therefore, this is the larg-
estspring semester in the history
of the\University.” As a contrast,
the spring registration of 1945

was only four days in length,
while this spring’s registration

had to be extended to six days.
Dr. Quick stated that of the 8,367
enrolled, 3,217 are new students.

‘-The num-ber of veterans was
increased by more than 500

full dvayti-me classes in the late
afternoons and evenings,” he said.
In comparing new freshmen this
term with those of last springs
term, the ﬁgures show 1,274
agaist 235. _There is also a com-
parison of the second semester
freshmen this term, numbering
1,104, with those this same time
the past "year, numbering 497,
.bringing the total number
freshmen to 2,378. The overall
total of undergraduates in the

University is 4,595, consisting of.
plication for hospitalization dur-
ing re-3‘istration week may do so

1,866 new students, and 2729 old
students,-an increase of 2,506 over
last year.

In the Graduate school. day
student registration numbering

198, new students, with 176 old
students, brings the total to 374,
as, compared with the 113 last
year. The Late Afternoon, Eve-
ning, and Saturday registration
reached 3,398, consisting of 1,153
new students and 2.245 old stu-

dents. There are 1,090 more AE

and S students than during the
spring semester of 1945.

In every instance, there is an
increase over the mid-year of
1945. This year the’University ad-
mitted 3,217 new students against
760 last year. It also registered
5,15-0 old students against 3,677
last year. The overall total of
veterans numbers over 4000,

A look at the attendance fi;_;urcs for the 1"cg'L1la.1- l4.‘riL‘la.y
scrvi.ccs in tho llcinz Mcnioriul chapel shows a very cilisccv1.1Lro§;;ing'
picture. 'l‘h.c total number oi’ students and faculty 111en1b.c1rs
and visitors present at the weekly services from Septeiiibcr 28
to January 18 is only 2,-l83, with a high attendance of ‘£42 on
October 12. Tlnere are no liolidays around ilmt date which
might explain ihe meaning for such an at-tendaiicc, high in com-
pz-1.rison with the other figi11*es yet low in compairison to what
the ﬁ.gurcs should rcatl fpr a iiiiivcrsltty with our cnrol_ln1c11t.
The only event which might have some bearing on the above
ﬁgure is the “Hello \Veel<” prograni which was Sp()llSO1‘CCl by
Student (,‘:on.gi-css during the whole xvecl-: of October 8. 3

Reasons for this lack, of attendance may be inte1'p'1'cte_d as

perhaps :1 lack of spiritual appreciation on the part of; students
and faculty. Or in contrast it might be the love of blue ..3nol{c,
noisy clm.tte1-ing, congested booths and tables in the ca. eteria
and Tuck shops that lure the would-be attenders away from the
serene and i11s13ii'i11g at1n‘"osphe1;e of the sedate and impressive
Heinz chapel. . _' ' ‘ ‘ '  . " 
‘ Nevertlieloss, 1‘eg'a1-dless of, what the reason may be, it 
ftimc we realize the iiiatci-i‘a.l and non-inatcrial values to be g'aine(l
from attending the services at our own chapel. Remember the
chapel is not a church; it has no connection with a" church.
Serving as a center of religious activity the chapel is 11on-scc-
ta1'_i.:m. Devotional services are led by students and faculty
every Friday from 12 :4-5 to 1 :30 o’clock.

That celebration has already been planned by a few of the
faculty and mzniy hundreds of coeds. The various committees
have been working unceasingly for many months getting‘ adver-
tising for a large and beautiful. souvcnicr prograins to be put
out, computing lists of patroncsscs, selling tickets, and other-
wi.sc sllapingg‘ the commemorative beneﬁt. Now that the grouucl
work has been laid we must all join in to make it the ‘success
that a 50th amiiversary warrants.

Cooperation froin the Nixon theatre 1'nanag'e1ncnt has made
possible plans for a. gala “Pitt Night” at the Nixon. “On The

work of Betty (3oin(l.<m» and Adolph Green (authors of “.Mil_lion

of play which appeals to students, parents, and alumnae alike.

Power Strike Draws
Student Commentary    

By Ted Iluminski

ject of bitter debate. p ‘
Meanwhile the public with its
ear to the wind waits hopefully
fol’ relief. In the recent crisis it
f.see~med that management showed
;little foresight in its dealings with
Ithe strikers. Knowing that public
iindignation would run high in the
{event ‘of a utilities strike the
_;company blandly ignored legiti-
imate requests to negotiate. The
president of the independent union
summed up his -position rather
clearly. “The company believes no

. union would dare strike a power

The effects of the strike are too

parable to the ﬂood of 1936. The
§hea«lth of the entire community
would have -«been greatly imperil-
ed and the public would have
paid a thousandfold. As usual the
public would have been caught in
the middle ‘because it is incapable
of. any coordinated action. 
i The manner in which President
‘Truman reacted to a request to
seize the plant was not '“w-holly
=unexpected. Pittsburgh is a party
stron-qhold and -bucking labor at
this time -might have its effect in
this year’s elections and in 1946.

Seizure of strike ibOl.1ll'Cl prop-
erties and their operation by the
sgov-ernment under the Smith-
7Connal-ly act was the favorite
fmethod of coping with wartime
strikes. Now, however, the strik-

refuse to return to work as "in
the case of the recent New York
tugboat strike. This would make
‘the Smith—'Connally act ineffec-
tive and the need for suitable
;‘legislation to cope with the strikes
zis urgent. At present a bill for
legal lfaet-ﬁnding commissions is

from doing the same thing?

The right to strike is a pre-
cious -privilege of labor, but it is
alright wh.ich imposes an ap.pa11§,‘
lug"responsibility. Strikes in the
case of public utilities are reck-
less whatever the case. Both the
-company and the union should
never forget this. The present
“strike is suspended but does not
‘prevent a reoccurrence here and
-anywhere else and need for far
sighted, stringsent labor legisla-
;tion was never more urgent. In
;the case of utilities, special treat-
irnent is required because of the
fclose rel.ations'hip to the public
welfare and convenience and be-
cause ﬁnancial affairs of public
utilities are subject to govern-
:ment regulation.

The recent -strike has demon-
strated clearly that (1) in the case

Sounds like
The next Pitt

Players’ show is Jim Dandy, the work of William Saroyan,, and the
call is out now for technical workers.

All students interested in work

ing in the technical staﬁ of Play-

ers are requested to meet with Bob Grape, Pitt Players technical

director, in the Players office on 86
any time between 3:30 and 5:30
c/clock today. There will also be
a meeting Monday afternoon at
the same time for those who can-
not attend today’s meeting.

Technical work involves set de-
signing, construction, and paint-
ing. It means electricians, carpen-
ters, and handiymen—and’ women.
It means costume designing and
making, research work for authen-
tic props, and make-up specialists.
It also means carrying ﬂats and
scrubbing ﬂoors. This covers a lot
of things, and who knows, some
of you may have latent capacities
that you never know about!

So, if you feel that you can ﬁll
any of the positions enumerated
above, or have other trainin-g that
will ﬁt you for back-stage work,
"be sure to -come to today’s or Mon-
day’s meeting. This applies both
to the students who responded to
the fall organization meeting of
players and all other interested
students on campus.

This announcement does not ap-
ply to those students who are in-
terested in working on the busi-
ness and advertising staffs of
Players. They will be contacted
later, and given their assignments.

.Work for both the Saroyn show
and the spring festiva_l'perform-
ance will begin immediately, and
it is essential that all students in-
terested in working on these shows
make their appearance now.

Tryouts Slated
By Pitt Players

Tryouts for the two Pitt Play-
ers productions scheduled for the
spring semester will be this af-
ternoon from 3:30 until 5:30
o’clock in room G-21 CL and from
7:30 until 9:30 o’clock this eve-
ning in Stephen Foster audito-
rium.

All students interested in par-
ticipating in the spring shows are
asked to attend these meetings,
as ﬁnal casting will be done to-
night. Both students who tried
out in the fall semester and new
students are eligible for these
productions. .

Of the two "shows "to'I‘be pre-
sented, the first will be William
Saroyan’s Jim Dandy, which ‘will
be produced some time in April.
The second show is a real old-
fashioned melodrama, which will
be put on at Spring Festival time.
B-oth -productions will, however,
go into rehearsal at once.

For Jim Dandy the following
characters are needed: “Jim
Dandy, Anybody, preferably 3-00
pounds in weight; Jim Crow,
Anybody, Anybody Else, a tap
dancer and boogie-woogie player,
preferably a Negro; Johnny, a
young man with one foot in the
grave; Flora, a young woman,
Cleopatra type; Little Johnny, a
n e w-c o m e r, 'somebody’s little
brother; Fishkin, a pessimist;
Jock, an optimist; Molly, a mod-
ern dancer; and »a Letter Carrier.
«a bewildered Civil service man.”

The quotes are Saroyan’s, so
choose your own type, and come
to the try-outs, for, according to
the script, the “Time is Any Ti-me”
and the “Place is Any Place!”

Casting for the melodrama will
require the usual complement of
hero, heroine, villain, and aging
father, an-d again the choice is
yours. Don’t forget: tryouts are
at 3:30 in G-21, and rehearsals
for both plays start immediately.

ruary 28 in 817 Cl. All men who
are interested in becoming‘mem-
bers in the bands are invited to
the smoker. Several Pitt officials
will be present to aid in the dis-
cussion of plans for the bands the
following year. In addition, it is
hoped that E. V. Babcock, “the
father of the Pitt bands” will be
present at the meeting. Enter-
tainment and refreshments are
promised. _ ‘

The marching band, under the
direction of Lt. James Hunter of
the military department, will be-
gin drills for the fall season on
April 6. Every week, following
that date, the band will have one
practice weekly until their ﬁrst
annual appearance. After this ap-
pearance, the band will continue
the weekly practice in prepara-
tion for the ﬁrst game next fall
until the summer vacation period
begins. At least two trips away
from Pitt are planned for the
marching band in the fall session.
The marching formation and
method of performing will be en-
tirely re-organized in order to im-
prove the appearance of the band.

Robert L. Arthur,,conductor of
the University bands, is making
revisions and changes in the or-
-‘anization of the concert band.
A tour for the concert band is un-
der consideration if hotel facili-
ties can be arranged to accommo-
date the members.

In conclusion, it is hoped ar-
rangements might be made for a
trip to a camp for four and one-
half days beginning September 9.
The formulation of this new idea
of a camping trip would be a wel-
comed part of the re-organization.
After the trip, the marching band
will spend a week of intensiﬁed
practice to prepare for the ﬁrst
football game this fall.

Say There joc,
Lend A Hand
At Our Stand

By Jim Pettican
Do you long to throw words
around and have a -bonaﬁde ex-
cuse for tending to other people’s

business? If so, we have the an-
swer to your prayers and his ﬁrst
name isn’t Van, either.

In short, we could use a few
able writers. So some afternoon
when you weary of Tuck Shop
life and are tired of hallway re-
connaissance, wander into an ele-
vator and holler, but subtly,
“Eighth ﬂoor, please.” And then,
after the elevator has deposited its
human -cargo, namely you, in the
right place, follow your ears to
the place where the typewriters
are clicking. That will be, or
should be, the Pitt News oﬁice.

Next, walk up to Betty Wolfe,
our editor an-d give her a big
smile. This -approach is recom-
mended, since according to Dale
Carnegie, “Executives tend to re-
tain unfavorable impressions of
people who walk up to them and
stick out their tongues or engage
in other disconcerting innuen-
does.”

Once you are past “the chief,”
you will be referred to either Lee
Miclnerney, campus editor, 0.
Tillie Sanker, feature editor. Here,
you are between two evils. Sank-
er will leer at you and exclaim,
“So y-a think ya rat-e a by-line,
huh?” Or on the other hand, Mc-
Iner.ney will scream in your ear,
“Get that story, see, don’t come
back without it!”

- However, -if your constitution is
not quite up to verbal bouts witl.
the two above-mentioned execs,
then throw in your lot with yours
truly and join the ranks of the
copy -boys—this way your soul
will -drink in the true spirit of
journalism not to -mention a little
ink here and there.

All -kid-din’ aside, though, we
could use a few good Joes up
here. So here’s an invitation to
you new vets and any others who
may ‘be interested.

“Americans H are W rong Idea
Of Mexico,” Says Marcus

“Most Americans,” says Fred
l\larcLzs, “have distorted opinions
about Mexico and the Mexican
people. And the travel books, the
‘radio, and the movies do very lit-
tle toward correcting these im-
pressions. In some parts. Mexico
is a beautiful country, it’s true;
Mexico City is the most beauti-

ful City I’ve ever seen. But going‘

from the capital to the surround-

ing provinces, is like going from_

New York City into a primitive
world.” “

Fred Marcus knows Mexico and
the. Mexican people pretty well.
Three of his six and a half years

in the army were spent along the -

Mexican border, turning back
smugglers, renegades-, and polit-
ical fugitives attempting to ﬂee
to the United States. I-Iisi knowl-
edge -of that country and its peo-
ple was not garnered on any con-
ducted tour that guides the visitor
to t-he blazing whiter p-ublic build-
ings of Mexico City and the
gleaming splendor of Popoca-
tepetl’s ice-capped! crest and care-
fully ste-ers him around the back
alleys and away from the squalid
huts of the peasants. His‘ facts
were gathered on the furloughs
and passes he spent wandering
around the country.-

Of Mexico, he says further:
“There is practically no industrial
opportunity t.here. Farming and
ranging are the chief occupations
and the people live and work
much as the-ir ancestors did.
Three-fourths -of the people I met
were illiterate. They’re a light-
hearted, excitable, and intensely
(-lannish people, who resent the
approaches of foreigners.

“The morals of the peasants are

zona.

tempts to crash

strict and they show no mercy to
an offender. The army is the po-
lice force -and they keep strict or-
der, except when there is a na-
tional election, then there’s like-
l-y to be chaos. The Mexicans take
their elections seriously and use
some pretty drastic campaign tac-
tics, like throwing srti-cks of dyna-
mite out of planes. One time while

I was down there one of the cam-
,paigners got off his course and

dynamited a drug store in Ari-
After an election, there
was always an outbreak of at-
the American

border, as defeated politicians

-tried. to get away from their suc-

cessful rivals.”

Fred, who worked himself up
from a private to a warrant of-
ﬁcer (j.g.), also served in Alaska.
He was administration and per-
sonnel officer for the 94th Engi-
neers, who helped to build the Al-
can Highway. The climate of Alas-
k-a was far different from that of
the Mexican border; it ‘vas wet,
cold and sloppy. As a result of
the -climate and t-he heavy iron
content of the water there, Fred
got sick and was sent back to
Texas for treatment. Later, when
he partially recovered, he re-
turned to border duty. In the sum-
mer of -1943, he trained in the
Arizona desert for duty in the Pa-
ciﬁc, but just before he was to
embark, his old illness returned
and he was hospitalized again. In
June, 1944, he was discharged as
cured, except for the inconveni-
ence of taking ﬁve grains
oi iodine a day.

Right now, Fred is realizing an
old ambition to prepare for a
legal career. In a few years, he
hopes to enter the University Law
‘School. under the GI Bill of Rights.

There comes a time in every

7 frat woman’s life when it is nec-

essary that she sacriﬁce sleep,
studies and social life, lose weight,
good nature, and charming dis-
position and concentrate all her
time and effort toward one goal.
Now don’t get me wrong. She
is..n’t staging a campaign to vamp
that handsome vet who sits next
to her in English Lit, or she hasn’t
hit upon a schenie that will catch
the eye of a Hollywood talent
scout. No, sir--! Such tritles have
no significan.c~e~ here. What then
can this thing be that transforms
her so completely? There is only
one answer. Yes, readers, women’s
rushing has again arrived. This
semester formal rushing is sched-
uled for Tliursd-ay, Friday and
Saturday evenings of this week.
Until next week the rushing
program will monopolize all
women's fraternity activity.

VVe learned: that Beta. Sigma
Omicron "held a slumber party and
gab ‘test last Sunday at the home
of Norma Wallin. “Fun and Frolic"
was the theme of the occasion.
Sunday afternoon the AEPhis- were
the gracious guests of the Alpha
Omega dental fraternity at a tea
dance held in their honor. A gay
timerwas had by all.

On Valentine day at the Phi Sig
house the house-mother, Mrs. Feld-
heim prepared a pleasant surprise
for the girls in the form of a
special Valentine dinner. Need we
say more? This week Alpha. Delta.
Pi welcomes its traveling secre-
tary, Betty Jones, who plans to
visit the Pittsburgh chapter until
the climax of rushing season. We
also managed to secure the com-
plete lowdown concerning the new
ADPi house. The girls will move
lock, stock, and barrel into the
former Tri Delt house on Bigelow
Boulevard, sometime in mid-
spring. Best of luck in your new
venture, ADPi’s.

Watch those Phi Mus. We hear
they are planing big things in the
coming month. We don’t as yet
know the details but next week
there will be further details. Bet-
tie Berringer also gave her sisters
the traditional box of candy to an-
nounce her engagement last Mon-
day night.

Jean Mosteller, president of the
Chi Os, ‘visited the Chi 0 chapter
at ‘Penn State this past week and
from all rumurs she had 51 won-
derful time.

All setto make the rounds of
the “Greek Lcttered”_ ﬁr-ctraps?
Boss Sanker has us riding a tan-
dem since Jack Luke overdid the
expense account last week on cab
fare. If you’re all seated, start
peddling. Well, here we are at the
Phi Deli; house( that was fast,
wasn‘t it?) A Hell Week is ll‘
progress and the blood is flowing
thick and fast. Bob Bell, a recent
tr’ans't‘e_r from Michigan, is help-
ing to Garry out the bodies.-‘As we
continue on our merry way, our
little group has decfded to stop and
see what’s new with the Phi,Ep’s.
Everyone but Mel Steinberg seems
all excited about a semilformal
dance that is being, planned» tor
this March. ‘Mel, who is one of the
frat taxpayers, is tearing his hair
at the thought of the expense.

Scooting over toward the Delt
house, we hear rumors of a party
for their retui ning servicemen. We
also hear that they have appointed
a committee to check on romances.
T.hey’re worried about a couple of
boys named Lu Vestal an-d Lou
Mack-ey. AS‘. we continue the rid-e
we find» that we’ve' add-ed a Sigma
Chi to our tour-happy troupe, and

 

he tells me a few of his brothers
were up to Seton Hil.l and had a
swell time. Thanks to Vernon
“Doc-v’ Maury we have a solution
to the locker situation. He carries
thumbtacks so that he can hang
up his coat wherever he goes.

.Here’s the PiKA house. We un-
derstand that March 2 is a big day.
To be exact it’s Founder’s day and
a banquet with the alumni will be
the order of the day. Now dash.-
ing over to the Phi Gam house, we
find they-had a ;successful Hell
Week and welcomed’ nine new
brothers. Adding these to the 28
brothers expected back, they will
really be up to full strength.

Time’s getting short, so we’ll
have to rush to the SAE house
where all are boasting about the
newly decorated second ﬂo-or and
we must admit it is pretty nice.
lt’s just next door to the next and
last stop, the Phi Kap house. Here
we see that Nick Covato is back
once again and may join the “suit-
case bridage” on their frequent
trips to Seton Hill.

The Pi Lams have now of-
ﬁcially banned all future Hell
Weeks. From noizv on all hazing,
both mental and physical is strict-
vly out.

Four C«a.rgoyles
Decorate Pitt

By Margie Cole

Gargoyles at Pitt? Of course.
The next time you are scaling the
heights to Alumni hall for an
early morning Cremistry class or
going to State hall for English,
notice the four ugly, winged crea-
tures on the upper corners of
State hall. The purpose of the
gargoyles is the sa-me as on the
Greek buildings for which they
were originally designed. They
are decorative outlets for water
from the rain spouts.

The gargoyle of Greek origin

‘is the fruit of man’s imagination.

To make it as ugly as possible,
the Greeks, designed the large,
bulging eyes, scaly body, gaping
mouth, and b-at-like wings. If you
are spending the winter in a “no-
dogs-allowed” apartment or sur-
plus Quonset hut, why not adopt
a poor, homely gargoyle as your
pet. They are guaranteed to ‘be
faithful and economical.

Since we have survived several
brutal physical attacks, the explo-
sion of two time bonibs, and bare-
ly escaped the onslaught of a
spveecling automobile, we might 
well present the news to you as
we see it. We commence this cum-
minatory, calumia=.ltxory column of.
cauliflower (breat.in) with :1 poem
dedicated to a certain fellow
by the name of 32--

A Nut at the Wheel
A peach at his right,
A curve in the road,
Fruit salad tonight.

That well'infornned accountant-
to-be, Ed Lawson by name, tells
us that he’s fond of opere'tta:' —
especially telephoime oper-retahs.
Remember that operetta, “Barber
oi‘ Seville”? Ed» worked for him.
He was just a‘ little shaver then.

Stompin’ at the Heart Hop were:
Helen Herman and Spook Lynn,
Bette Melvin and Al Burgunder,
Nat and Pat-, better known as Nat
Maravic and Pat’ Patton, Alice
Sofis and Mike I-Inra, Rita. Shon-
berg and Burt Lipson, Marilou
Gcstner and Tom Wliitney, Chair-
man Ann Gross and her husband,
Don, Priscella. Smappanos and
Johnny Lozar and also Pat Woods
and Loy Collingwood. And ‘natch’
cupid wuz there, too. The dance
had a flaw though. If it didn’t
what would they dance on?
(You’re killing me!) Vi/‘e heard one
girl asked her date how many
musicians were in the band and if
it was a full orchestra. To which
he replied, “For your first ques-
tion, one out of every ten are
musicians and for your second,
they certainly sound like they’re
full.”

Buddy Duer tells us that his car
has a temperamential horn —- it
doesn’t give a toot.

Sporting diamonds are Irma
Kleinman and Sissy Kardon. Irma
is engaged to Jack Seawald and
Sis’s man is Bernie Ellbaum. Gin-
ny Barker and Jug Crock have
been singing “My Guy’s Come

. Back.” Do we hear tlhe tinkling of

wedding bells? A warning to all
those fellows getting married is
that song, “A ‘Pretty Girl is Like
a Melody”—after yuou’re married
you have to face the music.

The question of the week is-—-
Has the wiley Lou “Tex” Vestal

been hooked at last? Such seems
to be the situation and Ginny
Stitch seems to be the girl.

It couldn’t happen here—--but it
did at Seton Hill for Franny Reid,
Ray Killeen’ and Mel Be-in. ‘Their
girls are Pat, Patty, and Pete, re-
spectively.

Aha, what’s this? Il’s a late Ne-
gotiated Press News Bulletin (ne-

gotiate-d is French for th’=r-d de-
gree) What’s' that beam seen in
Jack ’ Aiken’s eyes? ’l‘he ;-n:‘;wr;r

is Sally Beam.

Back to the engagement depar"-
ment, Rhoda. Smith is engaged to
Joe Cohen, Bob Cahoon will marry
Gerry McGaw in June, Dick
Elicker and Marty Jane Lowrn-em
will do the same. Elaine Sklar is a
diamond wearer, too.

Fellows getting married, remem-
ber this: Two can live as -cheaply
as one—’-if one doc—sn’t eat.” We al-
ways say the chief reason tor
divorces is marriage.

This column keeps getting
SALLY-IR and SALLY-IR all the
time. The refer-en-ce is to Sal
Leech and Ir Dean, the Common’s
Room Casanova.

Bernie O’Neill‘s gal, Sal is sing-
ing “String of ‘Pearls’’ since Bernie
presented her with the same. A
late dispatch tells us that Larrrx
“Snookums” Hazeltine has re--
ceived a. valentine from Beth Alt.-
meyer. Lucky boy!

If you think the Tuck Shops
are crowded, well, the locker sit-
uation is a runner-up. Ask some
of these coeds who share their
lockers with six other people.

And, if there’s an isolationist in
the =Cat‘o.ed»ral, who is willing’ to
share a locker, please contact the
Veterans administration or just
stand under the clock and yell,
“Locker.” Once will be enuff.

Pitt Ends Home Card
With Titans Tonght

By George Kiseda
Westminster’s ﬂoor corps will return to the scene of one of its
most harassing nightmares tonight when it squares off against Pitt

on the stadium ﬂoor.

It was little more than a year ago-—February 15, 1945-—that the

Towering Titans trooped into
Pittsburgh and watched Dead-
Eye Dodo Canterna rimm 37
points to pace Pitt to a resounding
75-56 victory over Grover Washa-
%baugh’s cavgers.

That was the ﬁrst Westmin-
ster defeat by Pitt in ﬁve years.

The Titans absorbed another
setback this year when Dr. H. C.
Carlson’s machine thrashed them,
59450», at Farrell. Since then the
New Wilmington passers have
been buoyed by the return from
service of two regulars from ear-
lier years and thus may cop their
thirteenth triumph in sixteen
starts. A '

The newcomers to Washa-
baugh’s ranks are Stan Wasik
and Bill M-cLhinney. Wasik has
averaged 15 p-oints per game since
his return, while McLhinney bag-
ged the ﬁna-l ﬁelder in the Titans’
525--53 upset of‘ previously once-
beaten Akron.

Pitt will be gunning for its
eighth suc-cess against ﬁve losses.

The Panthers were shunted
down the district ladder last week
in drubbings by West Virginia
and Army. Ranked one-two in
the nation with NYU by some
experts, Lee (Blood-and-Guts)
Patton’s Mountaineers ripped the
Panthers from stem to stern with

a second-half -barrage and coast-
ed t-0 victory. 61-41.

Pitt knotted the Morgantown
Monsoon ﬁve times in the ﬁrst
frame and even held a 16-14 edge
at the quarter. Tom Laverte, who
picked up 11 points, dropped in
a two-plier in the second quarter
that gave WVU an 18-17 lead
they never lost.

The Panthers kept pace, how-
ever, pulling even at 25-25 in the
third stanza ‘before Bob Carroll,
Leland Byrd and Laverte touched
oﬁ the explosion and the Moun-
taineers steamed ahead.

Byrd slammed in 19 points and
Carroll xdiroppe-d‘ 13. Hank Zeller,
with 12», and ‘Sam David, with 10,
handled the scoring burden for
Pitt.

Against Army, Zeller ﬂipped in
13 points but was outdone by the
Cadets’ Johnny Nance and Roy
I-Iudspeth, whose 34 tallies ac-
counted for a 56-42 success.

Nance bucketed 18 markers and
Hudspeth collected 16.

Pitt tossed away its chances in
the ‘first half, scoring only one
goal in the ﬁrst 10- minutes and
trailing 3-0-21 at the intermission.
With 14 minutes left in the brawl,
the Panthers tied Army, 33-33,
but pulled an el foldo shortly
after.

Sports Editor

The Pitt track house, which is a very poor facsimile of any track
house on a university campus in the United States, still stands atop
the hill above the stadium. This so called building is without heat,
light and windows but yet the University of Pittsburgh expects a
track team be produced.

VVhose fault is it that the track house isn't in, let's say fair shape?
When Mr. Hagan was told of the poor condition of the track house
he stated that the athletic department didn’t intend to spend any
money putting it into shape, for it was going to be torn down. The
reason beingia veteran's hospital to be built in that vicinity.

When is this hospital to be erected? Now the erection. is under
debate due to an old coal mine beneath Herron Hill. Despite the erec-
tion of this hospital in the vicinity, its proposal shouldn’t liave
stopped the University from investing a little money in ﬁxing up the
track house. 1 1 '

Track pgactice must start early in the afternoon so the tracksters
can get in a” few hours before darkness sets in. If one thought the
basketball cougt was cold befoifi! the heat was turned on and the win-
dows ﬁxed,  step into the track house. Adding to the lack of light,
heat, and windevvs the track itself is in very poor shape. The Panthers
have appearegin the Army, Boston, and New York Indoor meets and
as yet they haye been able to practice starting because of the low
temperature. Practices are held with donned sweat suits.

Whose fault it is that the track house is in this condition‘? We don“:
know. But there is still time to improve it.

ANOTHER MI'.lSfI‘——A FIELD HOUSE

It’s apparent that Pitt needs a field house. The Ohio State and
West Virginia games proved it. Both cage games were a complete
sell out with thpusands of fans turned away. The West Virginia con-
test was sold outbefore the doors opened, the only tickets that were
sold at the gate that night were three dueats that a Pitt assistant
basketball manager failed to pick up at the ticket ofﬁce.

What Bittsbhrgh needs as well as Pitt is a ﬁeld house that can
seat 10,000 =ca,"e fans. If the Panthers are given a 20 game schedule
with Big Ten tee-ms appearing and other leading ﬂoor teams of the
country they could pack the house every time. Not only could we
have basketball but under the same roof we could have our indoor
track and also“ add to Pitt Intercollegiate sports boxing and wrestling.

The war is over and when building material is made available
maybe Pitt will gurprise the Valley with a huge Field house. Ma.ybe!!
Another Sugg‘_gstion-—A Swimming Team
Here is one "sport which Pitt has complete facilities--i ’s swim-
ming. “ ' ' _ '3

We have a swhnming instructor in the physical education depart-
ment who ‘would make a more than satisfactory coach. A marked
interest was shown in swimming when a group of students had a peti-
tion signed askipg for a swimming team.

l’-lzaflot-‘s are pouring in by the
lll,ii‘l»Cll‘-(E1753 and on the basis of
those. 1 can make a preliminary
rcrport on the voting of Pitt stu-

dents for their "favorites in the
popular music field.
Benny Goodman seems to be

loadiiig the ﬁeld in two classiﬁca-
tions. He is in front in the Swing
Band race, and has also pulled
ahead as the favorite instrumental
soloist. Tommy Dorsey's senti-
mental gentlemen are far ahead
in the sweet band race, while Jo
Stafford is leading the girl vocal.-
ists by a comfortable margin.

The other two categories have
two close ﬁghts developing. One is
for the favorite male vocalist and

fawcfown
here Fi-snlz Sinatra has a slight
edge on a certain Harry Crosby
(called by his close friends
“Bing.”) The other shows Spike
Jones nosing out Guy Lombardo
for the “King of Korn" crown.

It is quite  surprise to me that
Woody Herman ranks so low in
the returns s-o far. This year,
Wcodyiand his fine band have re-
ceived a large proportion of top
honors in several nation-wide
polls.

Of course, none of these results
are fma. and you have until this
Friday evening‘ to drop your bal-
lots in thebox on the bulletin
board, ground floor, Cathedral. Re-
sults VJ.ll_i be %'lD.l'l()LlllC8d‘ next week
