In
memoriam:
Michael
Perloff

Mallory Grossman
Senior Staﬁ Writer

 

Warm, calm, humorous and understanding are
just afew of the words used by co-workers and
students to describe Michael Perloff.

Perloff was a lecturer and assistant depart-
ment chair in the philosophy department until
his death from natural causes on Nov. 19. This
week, his [co-workers remembered him as
an intricate part of the philosophy depart-
ment, and his students recalled him as “a great

guy-
Mark Wilson, the chair of the philosophy
V department, said he did not workwith Perloff
for very long, but appreciated the time they
spent together.

' As assistant chair, Perloff helped Wilson
plan courses and the undergraduate curricu-
lum and did “a great job at it,” Wilson said.

V “He really did all the hard work around
the department,” Wilson said. “He did all the
hard lifting and left the rest of us to just focus
on our research.”

The role Perloff played would be pivotal in
any university department, Wilson said.

But Perloff often wentbeyond the tradi-
tional responsibilities of professorship —— last
year he threw a party for graduating seniors in
the philosophy department, Wilson said.

Nuel Belnap, a co —worker and close friend
of Perloff’s for more than 20 years, said that
when Perloff became the assistant chair of the
department, he never acted like an ofﬁcial or
a higher—up. V V ,

Belnap said that Mickey, as Perloff was _
called by his close friends, “stepped up to the
plate ‘when no one else wanted the job and
has since made a big difference in the depart-

Rendell finds
potential
transit
solution

Michael Macagnone
News Editor

The Port Authority of Allegheny County
might be able to avoid the planned March
service cuts, thanks to some $45 million
Governor Ed Rendell was able to send to
the transit authority.

The funds still require approval from the
Southwest Pennsylvania Commission later
this month. The commission is a 10—county
body that has decision-making authority

H over transportation funds allocated to the
region.

Representatives from the SPC could not
be immediately reached for comment.

Jim Ritchie, spokesman for the Port Au-
thority, said that the transit authority would
consider the plan and would not act until the

A commission granted approval. a

The money came from a federal economic
development fund, for projects that either
came in under budget or did not move for-
ward, said Barry Ciccocioppo, a spokesman
for the governor’s office. A V

Ciccocioppo said that Rendell intended
the money to offset a more than $40. mil-
lion budget gap in this year’s Port Authority
budget. The money, he said, was a one—time
solution for this year’s budget and would not
help beyond 2011.

Ritchie said that the funds were “a tem-
porary ﬁx for Port Authority and would not
resolve the State’s transportation funding
crisis.”

It is not yet clear whether the state funds
will immediately affect the planned fare
increases or route cuts.

Debogorski said he delivers various pieces of con-

Perloff a ‘man of many parts’

Perloff ( 1

Belnap and Perloff never argued about
anything, even while co-writing a book called
“Facing the Future.”

The pair managed to have fun throughout
the entire writing process, Belnap said, despite
the extensive research and other work.

Perloﬁ"s kind nature often showed during
the book-writing process. When the two were
writing articles for their book, the sources they
came across often used examples of murder to
stress points in philosophy. Belnap said that

Perloff refused to use killing to illustrate such A

points, and instead used books such as Moby
Dick and the Three Musketeers to make his
arguments. ’ .

Belnap described Perloff as a “man of many
parts.” He grew up in New York and once
worked backstage at a theater before running
a factory in New England. Perloff also loved to
travel and was planning on traveling to New
Zealand. '

Belnap said he often called on Perloff to talk
about problems in his personal life and said he
was always there when he needed him.

“He was always calm and always had away
of ﬁxing things,” Belnap said.

Wilson also attested to his calmness.

“He was somehow always calm, unlike most
of us,” Wilson said. “He was just good at sorting
out problems.” ' V

who took Perloff’s Introduction to Logic class,
said Perloff helped him with his problem of
making it through Logic. ' _

DeLorenzo said Perloff made the class en-
joyable and was very casual about the intricate
concepts discussed in the class, usually getting
laughs out of his students in each class.

“He made it nonthreatening, which is very
hard to do,” DeLorenzo said. .

Even though DeLorenzo had Perloff as a
professor two years ago, he remembered him
as‘“.an easy going kind of guy” who was very
light-hearted, understanding and a huge Steel-
ers fan.

“Logic is something many students take .

for a general education requirement, and he
made it enjoyable by putting humor in it,”
Wilson said.

Belnap said Perloff really cared about his
students, just as they really cared about him.

“He had a magic way of making sure all of
his graduate students were supported,” Belnap
said, by ensuring outside ﬁmding, by servingas
teaching assistants, or through fellowships.

“We don’t know what we’re going to do
without him,” Wilson said. “He played such a
major role in keeping the department running
smoothly from one year to the next.” I

Run—offs should replace primaries

Primary elections are polarizing American politicians — run—off elections could help politics change for the better _

Brendan Sullivan
For The Pitt News

I am probably more liberal than you. I’m
in favor of all sorts of1eft—wi.ng policies,
a public option in health care being the
tamest ofthem. But I’ve spent two years
watching partisan hacks in Congress re-
fuse to think rationally about any piece of
legislation the otherlside has put forth,
and I’m" coming around to the idea that
radicals, no matter how much I agree
with them, have no business represent-
ingus in Congress.

With giant majorities in Congress and
a solidly liberal president, the Democrats
of 2008 wasted no time trying to force
through monumental legislation into law.
In a completely defensive stance, Repub-
licans took a big step to the right and
established themselves as the “Party of
No” to combat a perceived excessive lib-
eralism. The result? No one is happy.

The 2010 midterms gave us divided
government — a great thing, forcing
both parties into proactive movement
— but also swept in a slew of ultra—con-
servative/libertarian representatives,
including Rand Paul in Kentucky, Mike
Lee in Utah and Pat Toomey here in good
old Pennsylvania. Instead of viewing the
morass in Washington as a reason to
come to the middle, voters favored the
fringe yet‘ again. I am frightened.

All is not the fault of the electorate,
however. Our Byzantine system of elec-
tions does all it can to elect partisans. I’d
like to take the recent Pennsylvania Sen-

ate election as an example of the negative
repercussions of the system and suggest
a simple alternative. .

A few background notes: Arlen Spec-
ter, after serving in the Senate since 1980
as a Republican, switched parties in 2009
because he knew he was unelectable in
the Republican Party. He knew he was,
as if it were a pejorative, too moder-
ate, according to statements he made
when he announced the party switch.
As a result, he was seen as an opportun-

andcloser to Republican views than
Sestak; doesn’t that make him the best
candidate for the wider electorate? It
does, but clinging to a party primary
system has removed the option of a truly
_middle—of—the-‘road representative.
The solution is to abandon the party

primary ‘system in favor of a two—round

run—off election. According to the Ace
Project, a run—off is a simple method
of election and is already being used in
countries around the world.

The 2010 midterms gave us divid-
ed government - a great

movement - but also swept in a
slew of ultra—c0nservatives.

ist by Democratic voters, according to
the Washington Post, and consequently

lost the primary race to Joe Sestak. Pat A

Toomey breezed through the Republican

primary and put up good numbers for a I

win in the general.

But if Arlen Specter was the middle
ground between Sestak and Toomey, why
was he not re—elected? He would have
been closer to my views than Toomey,

The basic gist is this: All primary can-
didates run in the same ﬁeld, and voters
decide on who best matches their views

‘regardless of party affiliation.

In our example, this means Specter
never would have felt" he needed to change
parties to be re—elected, saving him from
the taint of disingenuousness.

After the first round of the run-off,

the top two vote-getting candidates move

on to the second round, currently called
the general election. Considering that
in a run—off Specter could have pulled
moderate votes from both, parties, I am

confident that he would notlhave ﬁnished .

last in a field of him, Toomey and Ses-
tak, keeping in mind again that he would
not have suffered the embarrassment of
switching parties. In the second round,
Specter would have easily been able to

. win over the more partisan candidate

Sestakvor Toomey. '

The incredible power of the run—off
system is to allow for the election of
moderate candidates, who could not
please 50 percent of either party, but
could easily please 50 percent of the
whole of the body politic.

Truth be told, I never really liked Ar-
len Specter. I disagreed with a whole
host of his positions, but what he had
that neither Sestak nor Toomey has is
the ability to compromise, to see the
advantages and disadvantages of each
side’s policy initiatives and to make his
decisions after careful, thoughtful de-
liberation. Not to mention the senior—
ity he accumulated over his years in the
Senate, an advantage that is nothing to
sneeze at. ‘

I am a radical, and I like radical poli-
cies. But a run—off election is not a radi-
cal solution; it is a simple way to ensure
that the middle ground, and not just the
partisan heavies, are heard and repre-
sented. '

Cutting hair not as

Christensen 4 5

go for a bike ride. Sometimes I go bald.
There’s no telling. ‘

Living these ﬁrst few weeks with less hair
than Fabio, I’ve realized that a girl without
much on her head takes in the world around
her in a completely different way. For one
thing, there’s nothing to hide behind. I can’t
really describe what it’s like to have your
face out there all the time, but it’s jarring.
Everyone can see your emotions written all
over your face when you don’t have a curtain
of hair to distract them. It makes you into
an emotional caricature until you learn how
to control your facial tics of discontent or
joy —— or, in my case, you become more of
what you.already were. I’m pretty sure I’m
still an open book, easily read.

' Even though I’m more visible with short
hair, it’s surprising to ﬁnd who doesn’t rec-

ognize me. Minor acquaintances often have
no idea who I am —— or they do a double take
at seeing my handsome yet effeminate twin
brother. Being in accidental disguise has
high entertainment value. Also, it makes
ﬂeet escapes much easier.

In those ﬁrst few days, should they rec-
ognize me, people looked at me a little dif-
ferently. In turn, I started to feel a little
differentabout myself. For instance, some
of my friends mistakenly viewed my impul-
sive act as “ballsy” or “brave,” making me
feel much more ballsy than I actually am.
Crotch—stuff1ng is dangerous: I felt so ballsy
that I was basically waiting for the chance
to show off my fake package. So when some

- boy made a comment about me looking like

a lesbian, I unleashed a whole package of
crazy in a ﬁt of faux—feminist venom. Maybe

scary as

the hairdresser cut out some brains, too. I
mean, to be fair, I do own combat boots.
Delusions of balls aside, getting all my
hair cut off made me_realize that there is,
infact, a lot of emotion assigned to hair,

. particularlyfor women. Sure, I.was like

Summer. I walked into that hair salon ﬁill of
swagger, thinking that the chop would make
me care less, if anything. But for whatever
reason, we do feel something when we get
it cut —- or when we don’t. That’s why, for

many women, long hair is a source of pride. V

That’s why you hear stories about women
chopping off their locks after a breakup. In
what’s probably a less frivolous example,
many traditional religions either forbid
women from cutting their hair or from
growing it out or have them hide it under
wigs orheadscarves in public. It can be a

it sounds

symbol of their love and devotion to faith.

Once I got over myself, I realized that
the most wonderful thing about not hav-
ing much hair is that I only have to wash it

' about once a week. What’s more, I think this

is probably the only time in- my life when
I’ll be able to show off my face — I mean,
in another few years, I’m only going to get

uglier. So for any girls reading my column: If '
I you’ve always wanted to cut off all your hair

but were afraid to do so, don’t worry. Face
your fear. Sure, you’ll miss it sometimes,
and you’ll feel awkward. I’m still waiting for
someone to accidentally call me “sir.” But
going outside of your comfort zone is the
only way to have an adventure, especially
if you’re bored on a lazy Tuesday.

Michael Phillip Edwards’ one-man play,
“runt,” is grounded in a provocative
question — what makes a strong dog
think it’s weak?

The play’s title, Edwards said, is a

' Jamaican pejorative term for the dog I

that feeds last.

“In Jamaica there are a lot of wild
dogs —— the one that gets to the food
first is the top dog, while the runt is
the one who eats last; This dog isn’t
particularly the weakest or the smallest,
but the most afraid,” Edwards said.

This dynamic, Edwards said, is re-
flective ofJamaica’s competitive, male-
dominated society. In_the play, the actor
examines its effect on his relationship
with his father.

Perhaps the most striking aspect of
the play isthe fact that the only person
on stage is Edwards himself.

The actor cited his admiration for
the work of Richard Pryorand his abil-
ity to conveyscenes of his life on stage
by himself.

The playfs one-man form is a trying

one, Department ofTheatre Arts profes— g

sor Lisajackson-Schebetta explained.

“The one-person show is a particu-
larly demanding form of theater. It re-
quires an actor to b.e very well trained
and agile as they often play multiple
characters in different time periods,”
she said.

But many people have faith in Ed-

wards’ abilities. Janis Burley Wilson, ~

who worked to bring “runt” to the Pitts-
burgh Cultural Trust —— of which she is
vice president -—— described her excite-
ment about the project: “We are thrilled
to have the award-winning talent of Mi-
chael Edwards performing for us.”
Edwards said he chose the one-man
form to further personalize his struggle,
explaining, “It wasn’t so much me be-

ing narcissistic as much as it was me
wanting to’ create a story in which the
audience asks, ‘How is the man on stage
going to conquer his demons?”’

. According to Edwards, “runt” came
to fruition because of an event in his
personal life. “I started the play when

will transcend its script to become a
cathartic journey through the perils
of family.

In addition to adorable kittens and gravity-
defying stunts, YouTube’s instructional videos
ensure that the site is the Intemet’s capital of
procrastination. . -

These videos are easily accessible resources
for handling otherwise difficult undertakings.
For instance, I retaught myself how to knit
using the simple visuals and instructions from
a woman with a soothing British accent. A
friend of mine taught herself how to master:

ﬁilly create 1940s hairstyles like pin curls and .

But there are things that I — and I believe
many people — would prefer that you did not

some is best not acquired at all.

First, Howcast claims all you need is “conﬁ-

“bright smile” is a horriﬁcally awkward child
with an uncomfortable grimace.

The video also suggests that you use social,

tell you to cram the school’s wall with photos,

GD REVIEW

‘Champions’ more noise than nuance

All the Way Rider (above) has crafted a fun but unremarkable LP, “City of Champions,” that lacks originality.

Anna Weldon
Staﬁ‘ Writer
City of Champions
All the Way Rider
Rocks Like: Foo Fighters
Grade: B

All the Way Rider’s newest album has at
least one thing going for it. The title, which
the band found scrawled on a brick wall
outside a pub, is an homage to the Steel

City.

Naturally, a decent album follows. With
11 tracks, City of Champions is full of loud
guitars, pounding drums and forceful
singing, periodically filled with throaty
screams.

All the Way Rider is from Minneapolis
and has an EP and two previous albums
already under its belt. The three-person
band consists of Jeremy Jessen, Rocky De
Vries and Scott Walters.

Though the band balks at placing itself
within a single genre, it is clear that All
the Way Rider involves traditional rock
instrumentation, as well as more alterna-

tive, modern signatures‘, which resonate
a harder sound. Its “non-genre” is easily
distinguishable in other contemporary
bands. , , 3
Unfortunately, much of thealbum comes
off as a mediocre emulation of the Foo -Fight-
ers —7 City of Championshas a homogenous
hard—rock sound, with each track almost
indistinguishable from the next.
Thankfully, what Champions lacks in nu-

ance it makes up for in volume — each song V

is packed with more than enough noise for
the entire album. 3 _

Pitt seeks revenge against Bearcats

Pitt safety Jarred Holley makes an interception in front of_Cincinnati’s Mardy Gilyard last season. The Bearcats won the game 45-44.

Dustin Gabler
Staff Writer

The Pitt football team will look to exact
revenge on the Cincinnati Bearcats tomor-
row. With last year’s painful 45-44 loss still

— fresh in its mind, the team will look to gain

some momentum heading into the bowl
season.

The Panthers are also seeking to ﬁght
off a .500 season and will look to send their
seniors out in a winning fashion despite
their disappointing senior day against West
Virginia.

“It’s important to these kids [to win] --
the seniors and the junior class who is get-
ting ready to step into the future. They’re

 

all well aware of it,” Pitt head coach Dave
Wannstedt said. “Our seniors wantto go out
on a good note. There are all the reasons in
the world to have a good week of prepara-
tion and .to go out and win this game.”

Pitt was able to put aside an emotional
loss to West Virginia with a conference
championship at stake, and go out to pre-
pare for the Bearcats on the practice ﬁeld
this week. »

— “It was tough starting off [Sunday’s
workout] for everybody, as I. would have
expected. We actually put the "pads on,
went inside, and we got after it pretty well,”
Wannstedt said. “In the last half hour of
practice there was energy back, and the

kids were coming back. They were highly '

disappointed, as we all were. We have to

move on.”

In order to move on and gain its sev-
enth victory, Pitt must avoid turning the
ball over. .

Turnovers played a large part in the
loss to West Virginia. Fortunately for
Wannstedt’s Panthers, Cincinnati has also
struggled in the turnover department this
season.

Despite the Bearcats turnover woes,
they are very potent on the offensive side
of the ball and will look to get into a high-
scoring shootout with the Panthers like
they did last year.

“When you look at Cincinnati, they are

Ashton Gibbs calmly scored another
22 points Wednesday night against
Duquesne for his ninth straight game
in double digits.

And come Saturday, he’ll look across
the court before tip-off and see some-
one a lot like him: a prolific 3-point
shooter.

Gibbs shares the stage with guardjusg
tin Robinson Saturday afternoon, as No.
3 Pitt welcomes the Rider Broncs to the
Petersen Events Center at 2 p.m.

Rider (4-3) hails from the Metro
Atlantic Athletic Conference, where it
leads the conference in 3-point shooting.
The Broncs have hit nearly 44 percent of
their 3-pointers this season entering last
night’s game at Manhattan.

Robinson leads that offensive charge
with 16.3 points per game. The senior
from London has scorched his oppo-
nents from deep all season. He hits 59;
percent from the 3-point range, but his
best night came in a 77-57 rout at USC
-when he made all five of his 3-point shots
en route to. 28 points.

And, like Gibbs, Robinson is known for
his free—throw shooting. He had streaks
of 26 and 22 in a row last season. ‘*1’

As good as Gibbs has been for the
Panthers (8-0) this year, Gary McGhee
has been just as lethal in the paint. The
center tied a school record with seven
blocks in Pitt’s 80-66 win over.the Dukes,
and he also grabbed 13 rebounds on his.
way to a double-double before halftime.

glass. The Broncs are eighth in the MAAC
in rebounds per game, whereas Pitt is

know third in the nation. —

“We’re going to have a lot of different
guys rebounding. It’s not going to be a

win over Duquesne. “We have guards
that rebound and a number of big guys
that can rebound. The combination of
those things can allow us to be a good
rebounding team.” .

Nasir Robinson had 12 boards against
Duquesne, and he said after the game
that rebounding comes down to play-
ing tough.

“Being physical is my game,” he said

Jamie Dixon:

after the game. “It doesn’t matter who
we play. I am going to come out and play
hard, strong and physical.”

The best rebounder on the Broncs is
senior forward Mike Ringgold, who is
averaging 6.3 rebounds per game this
year. He’s also second on the team behind
Robinson with 12.9 points per game.

-st Despite Rider’s mismatch down ‘low, ‘

hot-shooting teams have shown they can
hang with the Panthers. Rhode Island
stayed within a possession of Pitt until
the final minute in the season opener
thanks to 14 3-point baskets. The Rams
eventually lost the game, 83-75.

I ' ‘ “They made some threes, some tough
threes and that’s what made the game
close,” Dixon said after the victory.

Rider had won four games in a row
until it hit a bump last week with losses

v—-.Gadson helped spur that winning streak

off the bench — he hit 11 of 17 3-pointers

one of the best shooters in all of college basketball.

just as explosive as they were last year on
offense. The difference this year for them
has been turnovers. I believe they turned
it over four times last week against Con-
necticut,” Wannstedt said. “When you look
at all of their numbers, they’re leading our

conference in scoring, and they’re leading

our conference in offense —— ﬁrst downs,
third downs. They are moving the football
and scoring points.”g ‘

Cincinnati quarterback Zach Collaros,
who leads the Big East in passing with 279.3
yards per game, has the talent to throw the
ball around on a struggling Pitt secondary.
He also has one of the best receiving corps
in the conference. ‘

“They make plays. They have receivers
in Marcus Barnett, Armon Binns and D].
Woods. They are explosive, and Zach Col-
laros does a great job of making decisions,”
Wannstedt said. “He can throw the ball from
sideline to sideline. We always talk about
how many quarterbacks can do that and do
it well. Collaros can do it.” , A

Binns and Woods lead the Big East in
receiving with 1,072 and 890 yards, re-
spectively. ‘ _

“They just have so many weapons all over
the ﬁeld, and it puts pressure on you every
play,” Dom DeCicco said this week. “They
literally are a threat- to score on every play
from any spot on the ﬁeld.”

One bright side for the Panthers has
been the play of their defensive 1ine._]abaal
Sheard, in particular, was named an AFCA
All—American and will need to continue his
solidplay’ to wrap up Big East Defensive
Player of the Year.

“That’s a great honor forjabaal Sheard
and for our team. I think his numbers speak

‘ for themselves. He’s had an outstanding

year, particularly under the circumstances
when Greg Romeus went down,” Wannst-
edt said. “There was a lot more responsi-
bility put on him. There‘ were a lot more
expectations that we_all had that he needed
to step up as a leader. I think he is excellent
at doing all of those things.”

If Sheard and his defensive line team-
mates can create pressure, Collaros could
have a tough time hitting his standout re-
ceivers. .

A win for the Panthers puts them at 7-5,
which would cap their third consecutive
winning season. Losses by Connecticut
against USF and West Virginia against Rut-
gers would send the Panthers to a BCS game.
And with the way the Big East has.gone this
season, no one knows what will happen on
the regular season’s ﬁnal week. I
