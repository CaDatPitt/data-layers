Co-Op Fair

by Michelle Pilecki
Contributing Writer
The Oakland Cooperative As-
sociation, comprised of about

135 members of the campus coin-
munity, opened with a co-op fair
May 23 at 5737 Fifth Ave.
According to its president. llay
Hichman. a former Pitt econo-
mics professor and chairmait of
the ‘Lniversity of Illinois Dep-
artment of Economics and Fi-
nance. the co-op was organized in
February. The group later merged
with the Oakland Co-op. which

was organized by Pitt students
tn 1968. -

The store now carries clothes.
small appliances. records. school
supplies. and crafts at a discount.
ltichman said that once they
have_a permanent building. by
September. they will also carry
textbooks and food in a "mini
department store. "

ltichman noted that a co-op is
not merely a way to save money.
but that they "provide a means
of engaging in full time political

Donald M. Henderson to the’post
of Associate Provost. Dr. Hender-
son will assist the Provost in res-
ponsibilities concerning teaching

  Money Saving Plan

‘action. of living one's life as a

socialist while achieving a wider
transformation of society."
One member of the co-op,,John

Bradley, a Pitt student, deempha-

sized the political meaning of a
co-op, stressing that its purpose
“is to save money for the mem-
bers.” He‘defined a co-op as a

.“place where people get service

cheaply and efficiently.”

In a retail store. commented
Bradley. consumers are paying
for the variety that the store car-
ries. He noted. liowever. that a
co-op would cut down onvariety.
and therefore cut down on pric-
es. He added that the organiza-
tion is researching different prod-

‘ ttcts to get the highest quality.

Bradley pointed out the preced-

' ences of co-ops. especially in agri-

culture. saying that it is now a
world-wide movement. With co-
opsgltc said. "people can relate
to people as people instead ‘of

as dollar signs.

‘A Brandeis University professor believes that
most Americans advocate withdrawal but not de-
feat in Southeast Asia. “It‘s not in the American
spirit to take losses and leave." Dr. Milton Sachs
maintained. at a faculty luncheon Friday afternoon.

“The American people don’t want "to lose the
war,” the balding academician contended. “They
do want to get out, but on the most favorable terms.”

In a humorless appraisal of (Alternatives for
U.S. Policy in Southeast Asia,) Sachs dismissed
"even limited escalatory steps" as unthinkable
now. because of the domestic turmoil they would

-cause. He said that the Nixon administration's

only real optioneat this point is "some program of
de-escalation."
Vietnamization .

Tracing the roots ol' the President's Vietnami-
zation program. the pudgy scholar pointed out that
the idea originated during the Johnson, adminis-
tration and was sparked by the Tet offensive of
February. 1968.

Sachs stated that "the impetus for Vietnamiza-
tion came from the Vietnamese themselves." He
recalled that South Vietnamese leaders Thieu and

~ Ky resented President Johnson's decision to halt

the bombing of North Vietnam and decided then to
press for a phased American withdrawal so the
could conduct the war in their own way.

“We are actually behind thewithdrawal sched-
ule which the South Vietnamese set up,.. he assert-
ed. ‘

’ Nixon’srMind

'I‘urning to the Cambodian situation. Sachs ex-
pressed the opinion that President Nixon was as
dismayed by the ouster of Prince Sihanouk as were
Cotnmunist leaders. "He realized that with the
end of Cambodia‘s neutrality. .a fairly stable sit-
uation had been destabilized.“ '

Continuing his analysis of ‘the President's psy-;'

ache. Sachs said that Nixon probably ifiealozedy itw'as

ed that a flagging peace machine in the,Un'ited  '

States posed much of a threat.

'l‘he Vietnamese specialist pointed to therdis-g

solution of the Moratorium Committee April‘ 18 and

noted that _"the fortunes of the anti-war movement
were not. on the ascendancy at the time."'He cited 

  

several reasons: . 
It Dove politicians had been alienated by stu-*5

dent violence and such symbols as the Viet Cong",

flag: .

2t 'l‘he minority plank of the 1968 Democratic,
Convention had been essentially
by the Nixon administration; and

3) International and domestic pressure on the 

US. had lessened as a result of Vietnamization.

Kent's Impact

But four deaths revivified the anti-war move-::

ment. “We are people who live by symbolism,”-
Sachs explained. “Kent State brought the war home
to U.S. campuses.” '

The changed mood of Congress, the emergence!

of dissension within the Nixon cabinet. and" the '-

peace movement's new muscle, in the professor"s '

opinion. have left the President few options. “The:

administration doesn't have much room for leeway 

anymore.“ ' ~

t

Nevertheless, he reminded his audience of the
Chief Executive’s political reputation, then pre-“.
dicted. "He will use whatever steps are necessary’
to meet his critics.“ Sachs said that the resident?
might. for example, focus on the Cambodian *ven-- 
ture's military gains and present an "appetizing’7 '
the‘.

picture of the Southeast Asian situation to
American people.

Recommendation . V

Sachs himself believes that bold new initiatives
should be advanced at the Paris peace talks.

He is convinced that if the United Stateswel

to suggest a cease-fire, assure the National Lib-

eration Front (NLF) ofits survival, and. guara

by American audiences. most par-
ttcularl_v because they are non-
realistic.

Sartre spoke for most French
dramatists when he said. "I am
lot‘, the real and against‘ realism."
Characters in French plays are

usually conceptual images rather

than what we call real flesh and
blood personages. To make its
points. French drama uses para-

.dox. irony. and iiietaphor. It is a

drama of language. taking often
to the wildest expressions~—to the
point of madness wliile.;-\mei'ican
theatre has traditionally sought
safer. iitore respectable identity.
Maids delves into the human di-
lemma of man's ilass andcaste; '
of a wastebasket of human emo-
tion; of tears of longing; of im-
perfections which are sealed shut
by and are _\products of the sys-

of the repeating sequence of life’s
unconquerable fate.

lul as a transitional device here.
in a few instances things dragged
a bit.

Linda Loxterman shows a new

versatilit_v from other roles lye '

seen her in._Her voice was hoarse
at times. and for some reason she
appeared somewhat nervous in
her role. yet she carried herself
graciously. Francine Nemitz was
impressive and deliglitfully be-
able. lier variation was quite
good. delivery consistently seiisi—
tive.» with a total performance
that left me with the feeling of a
skilled and talented young per-
iormer.

~Valerie Ososky shows a great
deal of promise. Although not fully
mat,‘ured—-she displayed some fine
moments (especially in the lat-
ter hald of the play) but her char-
acter wallowed a bit here .and
there. Henry Heyman’s set was

wen done andquite attractive.

 V-Pitt News

 Dear Sir:

I I feel compelled to answer Miss Kathy Lov-
ell’s letter in last Tuesday’s edition of The Pitt
News much of which was based on a conversa-
tion with me that she describes as "frank."

   
  
  
  
  
  
   
   
   
   
  
  
 

I did make every effort to be completely
candid with Miss Lovell. but she has not been
A equally "frank" in conveying what I told her in
response‘to her questions.

Her letter also contains statements not con-
nected with our conversation that are either fac-
tually wrong or which seriously distort the pic-
ture of University expenditures.

Without dealing with those charges which can
only be a matter of opinion ii.e., whether Pitt's
administration is "large" and contains "a group
of chronic ‘buck passers‘ "I. I would like to com-
ment on what she asserts I said to her.

1. The University purchased “a $10,000 Cad-
illac last fall” . . .” for the benefit of the Chan-
cellor.” That automobile in question is not ex-
clusively for the use of the Chancellor but is
I, regularly used f'or a variety_0f University pur-
poses.

-These include the transportation of distin-
guished University visitors. University officials
other than the Chancellor. and guest lecturers.

Last fall. the four-year—old vehicle that the lini-
versity then owned was worn out: the decision
to replace it was made by the Director of Pur-
chases based solely on economics. The net cost
3 of doing so. including the sale of the old automo-
I ‘ bile, was about$5,000.

2. The University maintains one home for
the Chancellor, not two. as Miss Lovell al-
leges. It is a residence which was donated to the
University some years ago. and it replaced a for-
mer "Chancellor's residence" which was consid-
ered too large.

‘The home. in effect comes with the job—a job
 that requires official entertaining and a house
big enough to ‘conduct it in. The Chancellor has
no choice but to live in it.

., The number of staff who maintain the pro-

-perty is three. It would -be impossible for him. or
‘anyone. to operate such a residence and carry out

the official functions with fewer people.

3. The University did not help finance a “trip
to Amsterdam” for the Chancellor in the fall.
The Chancellor was invited to go to The Hague
to attend an international conference of the Insti-
tute for Strategic Studies. a liighly_ select group of
intellectuals who conduct studies in thearea of
7 the Chancellor's own academic specialty.

‘It was a perfectly legitimate academic con-
ference for him to attend. not unlike those which
bother members of the faculty regularly attend.
Because of the press of University business. how-
ever. the Chancellor declined the invitation.

 

Dr. Posvar. more recently. did make a "trip to
a number "of countries abroad. His purpose was
to visit. by invitation. universities with which
Pitt has continuing. formal academic relationships
including the Chinese University at Hong Kong
and Ahmadu Bello University in northern Nigeria
and to attempt to develop new relationships with

Nepal. Ethiopia. and other countries.

cellor had more than seventy interviews with high
. governmeiit officials and educators.

During the twenty-day working trip. the Chan-V

Montgomery Explains His “Frankness”

The "stop-over in Saigon" took place en route.
at no additional cost. at the request of the schools
at Pitt with academic interests in Southeast Asia.

One result of these visits was a request from
medical educators in South Vietnam for Pitt
to assist in improving clinical instruction in Sur-
gery at the Saigon L'niversity.

Dr. Henry Bahnson, Chairman, Department
of Surgery, of the Pitt Medical School is now in
Saigon (not at University expense) to carry out
this work.

The "African safari" exists only in Miss Loy-

’cll's imagination: it never took place and was
never considered. _ » .

The cost of_th.e trip was borne almost entirely
by the British government. the Ford Foundation.
and the Agency for International.Deyelopment
with funds that could be used only for the [hi-
yersity‘s international development prog'rains.

4. The Chancellor's salary is $45,000 a year:
he voluntarily made that information public at
the time of his appointment three years ago. and
it can be found in the newspaper reports“ of
that time.

The salary is. as Miss Lovell states. "compar-
able to the salary of other college presidents."

In fact. a great many university presidents make
substantially higher salaries than Chancellor Pos-
var. _ I '

1 I would only add that the salary for the Chan-
cellor of the L'niversity of Pittsburgh has gone up
only $5.000 in 13 years. which is hardly compar-
able to the increase in the cost of living or the
increase in the responsibility of the position.

The total University budget in this period has
increased from less than $20 million a year to more
than $100 million. '

5. The cost of the proposed move of the Chan-
cellor’s office to the twelfth floor of the Cathed-
ral was roughly ‘estimated by the University ar-
chitect. not by an outside consultant.

When the Chancellor learned what such a

‘ move would cost. he immediately vetoed the idea.
The move is not "still seen as an eventual neces-
sity." V

What.I told Miss Lovell was that the twelfth
floor. one ‘of the few remaining uncompleted
areas in the Cathedral. eventually would be com-
pleted for some purpose—but not that one.

.Moving beyond ‘my own“ conversation with

Miss Lovell. I would. like tocomment on the.

points that she says she learned "by talking with
other people and from (her) own experience."
a) It is true‘ that the University Counsel is‘
.not a member of the Pennsylvania Bar Associa-
. tion, but there is no need for him to be.

Mr. James R. Wolf. a.graduate of Yale Law
School. does not represent the University in court.
where membership in the bar would be neces-
sary.

He serves as a staffadviser on legal and quasi-
legal probleiiis. such as the development of Uni-
.\'ersity bylaws.,, problems of human rights. and in-
terpretation‘ of federal. state and local laws as they.
affect -University operations. on which matters
he is an expert. V -

Mr. Wolf. it also should be noted. is a mem-
ber of the bar of the State of New York where he
lived and worked for many years before coming to
Pittsburgh.

b) -The University has not “cut the funds from
the entire teaching assistant program in half.”

 

--3?

Next year. the number of teaching assistants
in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences will decline
from 626 to 605. a drop of about three percent.

I understand this is largely attributable to
the elimination of the language requirement and
the consequent" reduction in teaching assistant-
ants in the language departments.

_ c) Miss Lovell characterizes the University
budget by saying that less than one-third of it
goes toward instruction. ' -
To do so is to distort the total picture. Here
is the breakdown for the last fiscal year. as set‘
forth in the L'niversity's annual report to the pub-
lic:
— Instruction - 32.8 percent
—_ Sponsored Research, training & consulting ser-
, vices-25.1 percent ‘
— Student Aid - 3.4 percent
— Auxiliary Enterprises - 10.6 percent
— Western Psychiatric Institute — Clinic - 5.3
percent ,

— Transfers to plant fund -- 5.8 percent

— Other Educational Expenses - 17 percent

The sponsored research portion of the Uni-

-versity budget is "financed entirely by outside

fundswhich can be used only for research.

Auxiliary enterprises. includes all _those in-
come-producing areas of the University~such as
dormitories-—which pay their own way.

Eliminating these self-balancing items and the
budget for W.P.I.C.. a separate institution. the
percentage spent for instruction is 55.6 percent.
Miss Lovell questions the "nebulous heading,of

other educational expenses.‘ " .'

The heading may be nebulous. but the ex— 

penses certainly are not.

This category includes all of the costs outside
of faculty salaries and related expenses‘ essential
to the functioning of the University. such as
costs of operating and maintaining. the Univer-
sity‘s physical plant. programs of development
and public affairs (which includes all of the Uni-
versity's community service and community rela-
tions commitments. the development office which
raises funds that appear on the income side of

, the ledger. and the cost for bulletins and‘ other

academic-related" printing). and such necessary
activitiesas the student affairs. registrars student .
records. comptr-oller's.. purchasing and personnel
offices. . — A

d) Finally, there is the question of “the Chance- —
l_loi' now paying $5-10,000 to buy new draperies
for the Babcock Room on the 40th floor of the
Cathedral.” 1 had known that the draperies in the
Babcock Room were worn out and needed to be"

' replaced, because I had been told as much by our

maintenance staff who. made the decision to or-
der new ones.- i

Iam sure that the Chancellor was not even
aware of it». unless he has read Miss Lovell's let-
ter. It is not the kind of item that normally gets
called to the chief offi'cer‘s attention in a -100;
million budget. I

The actual cost——and I double-checked with
our purchasing agent after reading‘ Miss Lovel,l's
letter—is less than $500. ‘ '

i

/’

’$’

_IVcan onlyconclude that the inaccurate re- Q»
porting of my conversation with Miss Lovell and

the number of errors of fact suggest something
other thaninadvertence on the part of the authors
of the letter which Miss Lovell signed.

 Robert Cox found it strange
_ that the same students who were
embroiled
_with the
last term were making allegations
about the University‘s misuse of
funds.
'. But then nobody believes in I
ythe“glass house theory anymore.

 Dr. Cox is the head of the Edu-
iscational Communications Depart-
"ment at the University and from
 that position he planned the
»Chancellor’s trips abroad.

I He criticized severely the alle-

Tgations made by "concerned stu-
dent” Kathy Lovell in a letter
‘signed by among others John

'.fO.I‘ Steve Cundra in the'SG' elec-

campaign manager

(ions, _ nd -_Mike:Ha-ley. chairman

First of all. the Chancellor
did not take.the trip to Amster-
dam purported in the article. he
said. I

"Dr. Posvar was invited to the
Institute for Strategic Studies
Meeting in The Hague last year.
but he did not make the trip.“ be-
cause there was too much hap-
pening on the campus at the
time." said Cox. ‘
-Secondly. the "around the
world" trip taken by Dr. Pos-
var was not subsidized at the
L’niversity's‘ expense. he aver-
red.

Again. the trip was set up by
Cox who insisted that it was
funded by the University of Hong
Kong in connection‘ with a pro-
gram for student exchange.

T It »'I‘hirdly,  xi revealed‘ that  the

grants awarded to the Univer-

sity by the Ford Foundation

and AID.

Cox further took account with
the wording of certain passages
of the letter. The term "safari"
he felt was misleading since its
linguistic meaning in‘— Swahili
is trip and not the romantic "jun-
gle jaunt" that the term conjures
up in most peoples‘ minds.

Although he is not directly in-
volved with salaries andlthe in-
cidentals of cadillacs, Cox ex-
plained that the $l0,000 car alleg-
edly purchased by the Chancel-
lor was actually half paid for by
the trade-in of the old one.

The ‘charge that he maintains‘

two homes is untrue.

Cox spokepersonally when he
attacked the charge that the Uni-

fact that some were let go be-

than a right to investigate the

financial affairs of the Univer-

sity (and if is probably likely’ 

that they may’ find discrepancies
that can not be disproven so eas-
ily), it is Essential that this in-
vestigation be undertaken" res-
ponsibly._ I

Does the end. justify the

means.’

It's an old question. a very old.
very debatable. unanswered ques-
tion.

There have been recent state-
ments by many college students
that. to change the system. they
would go as far as to cut their
hair. and wear a suit and tie ev-
eryday.

Of course, there is nothing at
all wrong with short hair and a
suit and tie, but only if that is the
way you have decided you want to
look. These students say that what
they are doing is not much to pay
for their ultimate goal of true
democracy, which probably is the
same whether they look “conser-
vative,” or “defiant.” But that
ultimate goal, while still para-
mount has to take the back seat to
the question, -“Can you still ob-
tain a goal, while giving up one of
basic ideals of your goal. _

If those students cut their hair.
only to fool those who they‘ consi-
der the enemy—if they wear suits
and ties instead of bleached blue

jeans. a T—shirt. a dashiki or cut- ~

off shorts as they would like to-
if those students start looking like
the ‘clean cut All—American boy.
so aptly described in Ben Frank-
lin‘s autobiography; they are hy-
pocrites in the essence of the
word.

It‘s not a true assumption that
all of today's college students who
look. shall we say in an unaccept-
able way to society. look that way

The Victory?
 Only If Students
3 True Ideals

judging a person. But let‘s assume
that the majority of students are
not just hopping on the bandwag-
on and looking the way they think
they are supposed to look.

By making this supreme com-
promise, students are sacrificing
one of the most important things
they are fighting for in the revol-
ution. '

They are knuckling down to a
system that says. "Okay we'll
change. but only if you do as we
say do. Sure kids (children) well
listen to you if you just look like
we want you to look.'_‘ —

So far there haven't been too
many concrete things to come out
theistruggle. But the one thing——
the one single achievement that
has been made is an awareness
of what a person really is. beyond
what you see with your eyes. the
awareness that the clothes don’t
make the man—the feeling of
pride one gets from being natural.
trom knowing that you are show-
ing people the real you: these are
things some of us are ready to
sacrifice for the ultimate goal.

The fact that some are willing
to give these things up sort of im-
plies that they weren’t that impor-
tant in the first place. They prob-
ably would answer that they are
important, but that they must take
the back seat to the ultimate
goal. But they must realize that
you can’t obtain that goal unless
you also have this freedom of ap-
pearance. The goal is predicted by
this freedom.

The end does not justify the

‘means. Even when the end being

sought is as worthy as the one all
of us are seeking. The desired re-
sult. it‘ reached by these students
could not be true or lasting with-
out the ideal of freedom of appear-
ance. L

In other words. unless when the
world effects the true ideals of
Democracy. unless every person
who helped to achieve that ulti-
mate victory know in their hearts
that they were true to their ideals
and did not compromise; even on
something as seemingly unimpor-
[am as appearance. it cannot be
called a true victory.

It all seemed strangely familiar. Pitt pitcher Mike Nic-
cols was on the mound when the rains started. Soon, it was
raining too hard. Everyone was running for the All-purpose
F‘ields‘_ equipment room to guard-againstthe downpour .
just like the Saturday before.$a ‘

This week, however. the _opp.osition that gathered in the
equipment room with the Panthers whenirain halted action
during the second -game ofia doubleheader was different.
The week beforeit was. Westminster, and the Panthershad
won the first game_ handily._ This Saturday, it was Penn'State,

- the team that hadgnosed-out the. Panthers" for the final NCAA

District 2 tournament’ bid. Penn State was a_team with its
head coach. Chuck Medlar, on the District 2 selection commit-
tee. Penn State had refusedto move the double ‘header ahead
a few days so that "it would be itncluded.'Vin_‘t‘he committees"

considerations. And Penn State had just edged5the"-Panthers,

2-0, in the firstgame. _ T , .

Just as there wasa difference, in oppos'ition'sharing the
shelter area, there wa_s'g;a difference in the ‘atmosphere in the
room on thisseéond consecutive Saturday of rain. There

H were friendly conversations between opposing, players through-

out the room-. A week before”, the Panthers" were natu'rally'de-'
pressed, knowing that. the rain’ was then washing away a
chance for a- win and hopes for thebid. '  ’ i l A 3

It's ‘an unusual condition when a team possesses one.-ofait.
greatest squads in recent history and yet does not holda winningi.

A _.\-levei_'theless.' Golf Coach Rex Peery will ‘explain that this
his situation. His team has won two. lost two. and tied one. and mean-.
while has -just returned from a losing encounterwith the‘_Navalf.'

.-Xcademy. 5-2. .. ’
"This is the best team we've
had since I've been coach."
H’ said Peery. _"At_least it's the best
in six years: our scores show it.
We only had._ -one man in the

86s against Navy. and he won.
his match. We also-had a great.

there were four teams who did

Peery, ‘like any coach, drools

difference to play at home. We
had a".-very good match against
Navy; it was very close. The
home course meant alot in that‘
one.” "
‘Another .factor which‘ has
smothered the golfers" perfor-
mance is the number of can-
celled.matches. Perhaps. Peer_v

implies. his team might have
