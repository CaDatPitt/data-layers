Steve Wozniak,” co-founder of Apple Inc.,

in the William Pitt Union Assembly Room.

Wozniak spent his time on stage in front;

of roughly 500 Pitt students talking about
hislife, the origins, successes and failures of
Apple, datasurveillance and the future of the

host of the weekly WPTS Radio show Tech

Wozniak beganby discussing his humble S

Working as an engineer for Hewlett—‘ Pack-

“I never thought I’d design computers in
my life. But I taught myselfon pencil and pa-‘

“I told my dad I’d get my own computer
someday. He told me it costs as much as the
house,” Wozniak said. “I told him I’cl live in
an apartment.”

His father’s remarks and his innate pas-
sion drove Wozniak to co-found Apple Inc.
with the late Steve jobs, former CEO of the
company, in 1976. Wozniak said he andjobs

“made a “perfect couple.”

Their goal was to create the affordable,
perfect personal computer — the same com-
puter he dreamed of having as a kid.

Wozniak said he gained a reputation as

“the guy who would design stuff for free and -

hand it out to people,” andjobs would market
and sellthe products. The duo split the proﬁts.

“Jobs saw that we had potential and said,
‘Wow, we should start a company,”’ Wozniak
said. ‘

They developed Apple Inc.-and went on to
design computers such as Apple I, II and III,
the Lisa and the Macintosh. Other successﬁil
products included the iPod, the iPod Touch
and the iPhone.

Duringhis talk, Wozniak criticized the ﬁlm
“Jobs,” which was released in 2013. Directed
byjoshua Michael Stern, the ﬁlm starred Ash-
ton Kutcher asjobs andjosh Gad as Wozniak
and portrayedan entertaining outlook on the
company’s formation. I '

Wozniak said the story “Jobs” portrayed
differed greatly from Apple’s history.

“If you saw the ‘Jobs’ movie, ignore it. To~
tally inaccurate,” he said. “Kutcher had the
outside mannerisms ofjobs, but not on the
inside. I didn’t feel like I got the real meat of
it. But hey, that’s just me.” _

The movie depicted the early “Apple gang,”
includingjobs and Wozniak, working day in
and day out from the garage of] obs’ mother’s
home. V

“Nothingwas done in the garage. The busi-
ness deals were done in Steve’s bedroom over

' the phone,” Wozniak said. “But the onlything

that happened in the garage was us loading
and emptying the car with computer parts
that we were buying and selling.”

Wozniak also spoke about the recent .
controversies within the federal government

OPINIONS  

I Pittsburgh public schools are in “dire
need of innovation. Luckily, a group of
teachers, community leaders and ofﬁ-
cials have joined together to ﬁnally dis-
cover new modelsgto enhance schools
in Pittsburgh.

by the Pittsburgh Federation of Teach-

ers and Great Public Schools, hopes to

analyze a community-learning school

model that has proven to be successful
. in Cincinnati school districts. ’

The community school model fo-
cuses on “academics, health and so-
cial services, youth and community
development and community engage-

_ ment [that] leads to improved stu-
dent learning, stronger families and
healthier communities,” according to
the Coalition for Community Schools
website. Community learning schools

’ . across Cincinnati offer an assortment

of services to their students and fami-
lies, fostering the idea that bettering

munity, as well.

Individuals recognized as the prob-
lem solvers for Pittsburgh’s public
schools have not done nearly_ enough.
For one, the idea of implementing a
community model in Pittsburgh schools
was introduced in talks about enhanc-
ing public school districts, but the re-
sulting reports from those talks failed
to mention such initiatives.

It’s promising that this team will
travel to Cincinnati next week to re-
search the model, but considering that
Pittsburgh Public .Schools expects to
run out of funds in 2017, not enough
is being done to discover new ways of
supporting students and raising schools
into thenew age of education. These
community models have produced

from a public-private partnership for

These schools partner with corpo-
rations to bolster a child’s education
in high school, ensuring that each stu-
dent that attends gains the necessary
knowledge to prosper on a professional
level. High schools give students a six-
year education through which gradu-

’ ates not only receive their high school

diploma, but also an associate’s degree
and a guaranteed job after graduation.

While these provisions all have special
importance with regard to the Rana Plaza
collapse, this disaster was just one example
of a systemic labor—rights epidemic that
has claimed thousands of lives. Having
read all the information we have given you
concerning the Bangladesh Safety Accord,
you already know this, and we’re certain
you understand the signiﬁcance of grant-
ing agency to workers.

Support to sign the accord extends far
beyond AID advocacy. Last month, AID
collaborated with the Pitt Coalition Against

Sweatshops and Pitt’s South Asian Student

Association to host Bangladeshi labor or-
ganizer Kalpona Akterand Reba Sikder,
an 18-year-old survivor of the Rana ‘Plaza
collapse. They delivered a powerful account
of their experiences in the garment industry
to more than 160 students who then signed
a petition in support of Pitt’s alignment
with the accord.

We’ve made sure students and the Pitt
community are aware of such violations

 

from: ,,,ﬁ,’_

to human rights. We’ve made sure the ad-
ministration is aware of those events, along
with the beneﬁts of signing the accords.-
We’ve done the work, and now it’s time
you do yours.

In addition, Pitt was recommended to
amend its supplier code of conduct to re-
quire brands to sign on to the accord almost
immediately after becoming an afﬁliate of

dent labor—monitoring organization that
focuses on protecting the rights of workers

conversation has been primarily one—sided.

Signing on to the Worker. Rights Con-
sortium was an important stepping stone in
establishing safe working conditions in our

licensees’ garment factories, but stronger
measures must be taken. The accord will
fortify the consortium’s, monitoring efforts

2 by legally mandating companies with fac-

tories deemed unﬁt after examination to
be held accountable. This is the next logical

g step in proving Pitt’s commitment to labor

rights — why haven’t you taken it?

As a fairly large institution with an in-
ternationally recognized name, Pitt can
send a message about its commitment to
labor rights by insisting on safe working

. conditions within one of the largest gar-

ment manufacturing countries in the world.
It is not merely a business decision, but a

~ matter of moral responsibility as a power-

ful collegiate establishment to ensure the
safetyand well—being of the laborers who
produce the clothes that tens of thousands

' of students and fans wear on their backs. T

We do not want our Pitt apparel to come
at the expense of others’ lives.

We implore you to join the ranks of other
university administrations and require your
licensees to sign onto the Bangladesh Safety
Accord so that we can truly exemplify our
school pride in apparel that is both fairly
and ethically manufactured. I ’

PITT HISTORY

Posvar Hall home to

Andrew Fishman
Staﬁ’ Wrz'ter

While beautiful PNC Park is perennially
ranked among the best places to watch a
baseball game, the Pittsburgh Pirates spent’
some of their most successful years playing
at a location much closer to Pitt students’
hearts:- Forbes Field, where colossal Posvar

Hall now stands.

A photograph within the massive, bru-
talist building depicts a scene unique to the
era: students crowded atop the Cathedral of
Learning to cheer on the Pittsburgh Pirates
as they closed in on victory in Game 7 of the
1960 World Series -—— the game that baseball
aﬁcionados and Pittsburghers remember as
Mazeroski’s shining moment and the ﬁrst
World Series to end in a home run.

Years before Posvar Hall was erected and

' years before the Pittsburgh Steelers’ multiple

Super Bowl victories established the city as
a football mecca, Forbes Field served as the
heart of the city of Pittsburgh. As the late

Willie “Pops” Stargell — who owned seven
of the 18 home runs that cleared the park’s
right-ﬁeld roof — purportedly said, “Oak-
land revolved around ‘Forbes Field. Nothing
in the city could match that atmosphere.”

Currently, however, little of the ﬁeld’s

legacy remains intact. Pitt provides little
tribute to the historic park, with only home
plate and part of the outﬁeld wall memori-
alized, as well as historical markers for the
1960 World Series team and Barney Dreyfuss
—— the Pirates owner from 1900 to 1932.
Some feel that the'University could offer
more of a tribute. ‘ ,

One of the criticsis Rob Ruck, a history
professor at Pitt who teaches “History. of
Sport” and is among the foremost baseball
historians in the country, with books on '
America’s pastime both within the city of
Pittsburgh and elsewhere.-Ruck noted that
there is only one photograph located by the

_ encased home plate that honors the ﬁeld.

Ruck said that he feels thatthe addition of
photographs and other memorabilia would

give the focal point of Pittsburgh sports his-
tory its due.

“Every group of prospective students and
parents stop at home plate, and I think you

could easily amplify that with“photographs,”; I
Ruck said. “Think of the early Pitt football V

teamswith Pop Warner, the Pirates who won
their ﬁrst world series herein 1909, shots
of legends Honus Wagner and Ty Cobb, the
Pittsburgh Crawfords, the Steelers. There
are truly stunning photographs of all this.
 Football, baseball-, negro leagues — all
of that. 1 think that you could do that very
easily.” _ .

Earlierthis week, Ruckbegan the process

of outlining a series of suggestions that he

feels would improve the University’s me-
morialization of the ﬁeld. Ruck declined? to
explain the details of these suggestions.’
Pitt spokesman John Fedele declined to
comment on Ruck’s suggestionsuntil Univer-
sity administrators have had time to review
them more thoroughly. - l v

Although there may be debate over Pitt’s' .

former lheart of Pittsburgh,’ Forbes Field  

tribute to Forbes Field, the city at large hasn’t

' forgotten the park’s legacy. According to

Anne Madarasz, the director of the Western

Pennsylvania ‘Sports Museum, Forbes Field

was much more than just a ballpark.

‘ “Forbes Field served as the city’s commu-
nity center, hostingfootball, soccer and box-
ing, as well as serving as a venue forthe arts,
culture and entertainment,” Madarasz said.

Itwas also aplace of political signiﬁcance.
Several presidents visited the stadium during
its heyday, including William Howard Taft
and Franklin D. Roosevelt, who made a ﬁery
speech at a historic campaign rally on the
ﬁeld on Oct. 1, 1936 — one that served as
a milestone in Rooseveltfs pivot away from
ﬁscal austerity to the New Deal Democrat
he’s remembered as today.

‘In the late 1950s and early 1960s, pres-
sure from the University and the hope of a
multi—spor_t stadium — where the Pirates

and Steelers could both play — prompted L

The A&E Staff pickstheqir favorite

A&E Staff
For The Pitt News

With baseball season upon us, the A&E Staff
celebrated the occasion by compilingasample
of our all-time favorite baseball ﬁlms.

“Major League” (1989)

Simultaneously a satire of every underdog
sports story ever told and one of the most
entertaining underdogsports ﬁlms of all time,‘
“Major League” is a different breed ofbaseball
comedy. Finally exhausted with the endless
string of terrible seasons from the lackluster
Cleveland Indians franchise, the team’s new
owner decides to put togetherateam just bad
enough to justify moving out of Cleveland.
What she doesn't count on is that her gang
of misﬁts might pull together and ﬁgure out
a way to keep ﬁghting. Featuring a career-
deﬁning performance by Charlie Sheen as an
erratic, hard-living bad boy with emotional
issues (really, how did he manage to play the
role so convincingly?), “Major League” is an
expletive-laden movie about damaged people

brought together by one  -— their dream
of not getting ﬁred.
“Angels in the Outﬁeld” (1994) .
“Angels in the Outﬁeld” is a keen reminder
of why people cherish sports like baseball and
how they add personality and charm to an

often mundane life. The outstanding example ’

of personality in “Angels in the Outﬁeld” is

Ranch Wilder (jay 0. Sanders), who plays the
part of a loud, belligerent, overbearing radio
broadcaster with a tendency tohog the mi-

crophone. In sports, it is often the personality
of the athlete that makes a story great, and
“Angels” is no exception. Angels ace Mel Clark
(Tony Danza) plays a central role as a star on
the team, despite the fact that he is a cynical,

grizzled veteran and an avid smoker. But byfar
the most touching concept in the movie is the
depiction of the protagonist, Roger Bomman
(Joseph Gordon—Levitt), and how the game of
baseball helps him rise above his situation. In

the beginning of the movie, Roger, a foster I

the Pirates organization to sell the ballpark
to Pitt.

According to Ruck, building an academic
building where Forbes Field once stood may
have been inevitable.

“Even today there is a great scarcity of '
office and classroom space, and as Pitt was
expanding, it realized it needed more space,”
Ruck said. “You can look at the whole growth,
with these dorms into South Oakland, and
next to Hillman Library — it was a natural
site.” . _

While Posvar provides Pitt with a rather
large offering of classrooms and offices, a
necessity at any university, Ruck said the
issue of memorializing a venue that held so
much history is still very relevant.»

“Clearly sport has become the story that
Pittsburgh tells about itself, and Forbes Field
and the University of Pittsburgh are parts
of that story,” Ruck said. “There has never"
been and there never will be an athleticyenue

. that has hosted such a diversity of sports

and other important events as Forbes Field.”

At the same time, some ﬁnd that the
University is doing enough as it is. Self-pro-.
claimed die-hard Pittsburgh sports fan Chris-
topher Reiner, an undeclared sophomore

"at Pitt, appreciates what the University has
already done to honor Forbes Field.

“I love how the old home plate is under
glass inside Posvar,” Reiner said. “The brick
 segment that still stands combined with
the  the sidewalk signifying
the outﬁeld  also-a really nice and un-
obtrusive touch to honor the old park. The
impromptu celebration held every Oct. 13 to
celebrate the 1960 World Series, although
not University- or city-sanctioned, is a great
and sufﬁcient way to honor Forbes Field.”

In the meantime, the Heinz History Cen-
ter is doing its part in honoring the ﬁeld, as
well  the Pirates teams of the stadium’s hey-

day. Anew exhibit honoring Bill Mazeroski '

and his iconic Game 7 walk—off home run
in the 1960 World Series opened last week
and runs through Thursday, May 1 — for the
entirety of the first month of the 2014 season.

“Mazeroski’s Pirates uniform and
bronzed 35-inch Louisville Slugger batwill be
accompanied by several 1960 World Series
items from the sports museum’s collection,”

Madarasz said.

This collection includes the pitching rub-
ber used by New York Yankees pitcher Ralph
Terry, who pitched the ball to Mazeroski
in the ﬁnal at—bat in Game 7, as well as the
ﬁrst base Mazeroski rounded on his way
to victory. _

While some question Pitt’s efforts to me-
morialize Forbes Field, most Pitt students
and faculty can agree that sittingin a class-
room where Pirates legends used to stand
is pretty special. ,

“In the 1970s, when this place was being
built, is when‘Pittsburgh became the City of
Champions,” said Ruck, who was a graduate
student at Pitt during that era. “I don’t think

I made the connections with how much of ‘

whatlwas doingwas being affected by what
was going on in Pittsburgh at the time.”

_ Regardless of what the University might
do in the future regarding additions to a
Forbes Field tribute, Ruck summed up the
relationship between Pitt and Forbes Field
as inescapable. , " .

“This place, just generations of Pittsbur-
ghers spent a lot oftime here,” Ruck said.
“The great thing about Forbes Field, I think,
is how organically it ﬁt into the community.
It wasn’t a ballpark surrounded by a sea of
parking lots.  I would be thrilled ifjust the
minimalist approach would be done. Pitt is
critical to the history of Pittsburgh sport,

“The Sandlot” (1993)

Whatbettermovie is there to watch during _

the start of baseball season than “The Sand-
lot?”. This coming-of-age classic focuses on
a group of young teenagers playing baseball
in the summer of 1962. While it might not be
'your typical baseballﬁlmfeaturing old-timey
sluggers, “The Sandlot” gives viewers a feel-
good attitude, as well as a little bit of magic
—" two aspects of any good baseball game.
As the memorable sandlot crew struggles to

. get a baseball signedby Babe Ruth back from

the formidable junkyard that lies on the other
side of their outﬁeld wall, they also build an
unforgettable friendship that lasts into their
adult lives. This movie shows us both that
baseball is a unifying force and the reason
why we continue to enjoy the beloved game.

“The Benchwarmers” (2606)

Ah, nothing says summer like baseball
and a sports comedy starring movie veterans
Rob Schneider and David Spade with Napo-

leon Dynamite (Jon Heder). 2oo6’s highly_

underrated “Benchwarmers” brings out the

But what separates this comedy about three

Instant replay
in baseball a
  y good thing

Dan Sostek
Staﬁ’ Writer

When it was announced onjan. 16 that Major
League Baseball unanimously decided to
expand instant replay, allowing managers to
challenge at least one play during the span
of each game, many, including myself, were
skeptical. Q

The decision expanded the previous in-
carnation of replay reviews in baseball, as
prior to the 2014 season, the only review-
able plays were home runs, and said reviews
could only be initiated by the umpire crew.

Now, managers are afforded a challenge that ‘

they can use between innings one through
six. If they win their ﬁrst challenge, they then
get a second and ﬁnal challenge to use. After
thesixth inning, reviews can only be initi-
ated by the umpiring crew, and no challenges
can be used. The MLB adopted a system
similar to the NHL’s in which the umpir-
ing crew will call up a replay center —— the
MLB’s is in New York —— which then tells
the crew whether to uphold or overturn the
contested call.

For a sport that’s most often critiqued
for its length and excitement level, it would
appear that this new innovation would not
please fans, but only amplify their problems
with the sport.

However, here in Pittsburgh on Open-
ing Day, if those fears and concerns were
not quelled, they were at least calmed a bit
when at PNC Park, visiting Chicago Cubs
manager Rick Renteria became the first
manager ever to use a challenge, contest-
ing a call that pitcher Jeff Samardzija was
out at ﬁrst base on a bunt.

The umpire crew went to the phone, di-
aled up the MLB Replay Command Center,
were told their call was correct and informed

Panthers drop second game intwo days

Pitching struggles had Pitt playing from behind often on Wednesday. Heather Tennant | Staff Photographer

Jasper Wilson
Senior Staﬁ’ Wrz'ter

While facing an opponent it beat by dou-
ble digits the first time they met, the
Pitt baseball team experienced a starkly
different result in the rematch.

The Panthers traveled to Ohio for
a nonconference matchup against the
Youngstown State Penguins, a team
they defeated 12-1 in their last match
on March 18. This time, Pitt struggled to
overcome a poor outing from its starting
pitcher and couldn’t score late, losing
the game 7-6 and tying the series.

Pitt head coachjoejordano summed
up the end result in one sentence.

“To say theleast, this was a disap-
pointing ball game,”Jordano said.

The defeat is the squad’s second

straight, having lost another high-
scoring contest in nonconference play
yesterday against West Virginia, 6-4.

Early on, Pitt picked up where it left
off, taking the game’s first lead inthe top
of the first inning when, with cleanup
hitter Casey Roche at the plate, a double
steal occurred, allowing fellow senior
Stephen Vranka to safely reach home
from third base.

The Panthers then added another‘

tally an inning later when shortstop Matt
Johnson singled home infielder Jordan
Frabasilioi

That advantage held until the bot-
tom of the frame, when the Penguins
battered pitcher Renan Rodriguez. The
redshirt sophomore allowed three runs
in the inning.

Rodriguez left the game after walking

a batter to start the bottom of the fourth,
having given up two more runs — one
in the third and ohe in the fourth. This

/ brought his total to five runs allowed,

all of which were earned.
But Rodriguez said that he “felt fresh
for [his] appearance” Wednesday.

“The last two days have been rough, .

but it’s going to happen in a long sea-
son,” he said. ~

Luke Curtis entered in relief of Rodri-
guez and slowed the Penguins’ progress,
but he couldn’t stop the wave of run-
ners from crossing home, allowing two
runs -— including the game-deciding
one —— in three innings of work. Curtis
received the loss.

FOOTBALL

Nate Barnes
Sports Editor

Head coach Paul Chryst’s third spring
football camp reached its midpoint this
week, and the Panthers’ results on Tuesday
mirrored the way camp has ‘gone in its
ﬁrst two weeks. '

 5‘As far as results, -it was up and down

 sides. ofthe ballj.’ Chryst said. ‘fl .
‘.think;we?v§aon¢ alot upfto this point, but
weihave to make ‘sure -we ﬁnish the second - '

half on a high note.” _ V

Moving forward, one area the Pan-‘
thers have to address is offense. Starting
at quarterback, redshirt sophomore Chad
Voytik is working hard, which Chryst said
he appreciates, but the starter needs to
continue to work on consistency. 3 I

As for the players ‘protecting the signal-
caller, the offensive linemen, Chryst said
the beginning of building the group comes
not just from players doing the right thing,‘
but doing the right thing as a unit. He used

April 8, 2014 I The Pitt News I v\/vvvv.pittnevvs.com

combination blocking as an example.

“If one guy isn’t doing the right thing,
then he’s not giving an accurate picture to
his partner,” Chryst said. “You can see a

"start in that cohesion, but we’re a long way
"away from where it needs to be.” _

Behind the line, Chryst hopes freshman
running backjames Conner can build off

Panther and rushed for 799 yards — an_

average of 5.5 yards per carr.y — earning
eight touchdowns. When Pitt begins fall

but also how improvements in his knowl-
edge of the game can help Conner take the
next steps in his development.

“He’s obviously played a lot of football
and has done some very good things, and
you hope it lasts his whole career. here,”
Chryst said. “Ashe continues to learn,
with that knowledge comes conﬁdence
and with that conﬁdence the game kind

A of slows down a bit and then you can truly

  Outside of the offe'i'1_sive~line, Pitt needs
' production from its receiving corps to re-

place that of departed senior Devin Street,
who ended his career as the Panthers’ all-
time leader in receptions.

That process starts with receiver Tyler
Boyd and tight end Manasseh Garner. Boyd
broke Larry Fitzgerald’s record for receiv-
ing yards in a season, hauling in 85 catches
for 1,174 yardsnand seven touchdowns.

Underneath, Garner was a reliable
option for last year’s quarterback, Tom
Savage, and was the team’s third-leading

Pitt looks to close up-and-downs camp strong

receiver with 33 receptions for 391 yards.
Chryst noted the accomplishments of each
player, but also pointed out that they must
improve moving toward next season.

“I really believe in and like those guys
as players,” Chryst said. “We have to do a
good job of making sure we use them and
they both will be big parts of the season.”

Garner says he and Boyd have a rela-
tionship on the ﬁeld that allows the two
players to “feed off each other.”

“Tyler, he’s quite an athlete,” Garner
said. “We’ve got two different skill sets.
I’m a bigger body, I’m able to do some of
the things that he can’t do and he’s able to
do some stuff that I can’t.”

While Boyd posted exciting numbers

in his freshman campaign, his goals for '

the spring and future are team—oriented.

“My main focus is just to win. I love to
win,” Boyd said. “All the stats that really
come as we progress, I ain’t really a big
guy [for] individually getting my stats up.
I want towin.” I

both parties that the decision was upheld.

This ‘whole process took a total of one
minute and 45 seconds. '

The review process might not be per-
fect, but it has been formulated efficiently
enough to bring more positives than nega-
tives to a sport that some believe to be stuck
in the past.

First, the review process will curb, if
not completely eradicate, the number of
manager—umpire arguments. While some
fans might revel in the “drama” of a coach
screaming obscenities at the top of his lungs.
at umpires, getting rid of these confronta-
tions by swapping out the explicit exclama-
tions with calm requests for an instant re-
play can only beneﬁt and speed up the sport.

Second, while the sport will never berid
of incorrect calls as long as there is a cap on
challenges, anytime an incorrect call can
be fixed within a matter of minutes — and

unlike the NFL, not even requiring a com-
mercialbt:eak— it can only be aboon to the
sport.'Instances like Armando Galarraga
losing a perfect game because of an incor-
rectcall at ﬁrst base will no longer occur.
The same goes for an obstruction call on
Will Middlebrooks in the Worldlseries last»
fall that now would at the very least go to a
review, meaning thousands of upset view-
ers, like myself, would have an immediate,
deﬁnitive response.

Lastly, the arguments against replay are
outdated. Opposition to technological ad-

vances that allow the aforementioned ben-

eﬁts is nonsensical. The “human element”
of baseball that people fear will disappear
with instant replay will remain aslong as
human athletes arenft replaced by robots.

The concept of instant replay may be A
tough for baseball purists to accept, but =
it’s the right move for Major League Base- _

ball, with increased replay leading to an I
increased amount of correct calls and, in
turn, put forth a better product for this sea-
son and years to co‘m'éI ' ii ’

of the third inning with four runs of its
own, one of which came off a fielder’s
choice byjohnson, his second of a game-
high two RBIs. But the Panthers wouldn’t
score again.

Youngstown, on the other hand, kept
crossing the plate with a run an inning
until it tied the game back up in the ﬁfth.
The hosts tacked on the go—ahead run in

the seventh inning, which gave the Pan:

thers ‘little time to chase the Penguins.

To Johnson, Pitt lacked energy.

“We started the game ﬁne,” Johnson
said. “But as we know, you have to play
all nine innings.”

The team’s bats, so active and suc-

, cessful throughout the previous meeting,

fell quiet the rest of the game, as they
scored no runs or hits in the remaining
six innings with just ﬁve men reaching
base. 5

“We did not do much of anything to-

day,” Jordano said.

The team’s next action comes at 3
p.m. Friday at Cost Field when it opens a
three—game series against ACC opponent
No. 1 University of Virginia.‘

Before facing the Cavaliers,Johnson
said the team will have to accept the loss
and move forward. , '

“It’s one of those games you don’t
want to dwell on with such a big week-
end coming up, but [a game you] have to
learn from and not let it happen again,”
he said. I
