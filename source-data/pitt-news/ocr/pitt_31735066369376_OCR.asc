PosvarSays Funds Insufficient, Tuition Hike Probable

By RODNEY B. GRIFFITH
Pitt News Staff Writer

Chancellor Wesley Posvar announced Wednesday that
tuition increases are inevitable in the face of the $66
million proposed state appropriation to Pitt. The allocation
falls $9 million short of the university’s budget request.

“The very modest increase in the governor’s budget for
Pitt and the other state-related universities is far below our
needs and what we reauested from the state,” Posvar
said. “The presidents _ of the other state-related
universities and I advised the governor that in these
circumstances stringent budget measures and tuition
increases are unavoidable.”

Richard Thornburgh’s budget, presented to a joint ’

Rates Up
Next Year

The Office of Auxiliary Services
recently announced to residence
hall students an increase in the cost
of room and board for the fall term,
1979.

According to a memo issued to
students, Auxiliary Services at-
tempted to operate on a “break-
even” basis, trying to keep room
and board services operating on a
balanced budget, with students’
fees covering the costs of these
services. Auxiliary Services
operates without subsidy from
other sources than student housing
and food fees. *

The housing hikes include a $34
increase for single and double
accomodations, and a $24" increase
for triples and quads. Single rooms
will now be $600 per term, doubles
and suites $545, triples $414,
quads$369 and Forbes and Bruce
Hall accomodations, 5569.

These hikes account for an
average six percent increase over
this year.

college, voted to down the Alternative Curriculum program, 5-4.

session of the Pennsylvania legislature, Wednesday ‘in
Harrisburg, included a 4 percent increase in funds over last
year’s appropriation to Pitt. The legislature gave $63.1
million to the university in the ﬁscal year 1978-79.

John L. Yeager, associate vice chancellor for the Ofﬁce
of Planning and Budget, said Pitt’s budget request was a
reasonable one based on the minimum needs of the
university.

“All that we are doing is [covering ourselves‘ for
inﬂation,” said Yeager. “Wehave not asked for new

- appropriations for ,the last seven years.” .

Yeager added that the administration has taken steps to
cut expenditures in such areas as energy use and

personnel. He pointed out that Pitt still could not control
expenses such as increasing utility bills.

One major request not included in Thornburgh’s budget
was for increased funding to Pitt's medical school. Yeager.
said the grant per studentto the school has not increased in
10 years while tuitiongcosts have skyrocketed.

Budget Secretary Robert Wilburn said at a press brieﬁng
in Harrisburg Wednesday that Thornburgh planned to
correct this by developing a loan program for medical
students and large animal veternarians. Under this
program, a students debt would be forgiven if they served
in a part of Pennsylvania needing a doctor or veternarian.

meeting came in light of a recent
decision by College of Arts and
Sciences Dean Irwin J. Schulman to
terminate the program.

A vote at“a Feb.’ 23 meeting
registered Council’s approval of
Alternative Curriculum, S-4-1.
However, because two members
indicated a desire to change their
votes after that meeting, a motion
was made Wednesday to recast
ballots.’

Schulman told members of the
Alternative Curriculum program at
the recent meeting that “Council
did not take the matter of the
program lightly.”

“The defeat of the program is
not a’ matter of pride,” Schulman
said. '

Council members also discussed
a proposal that would require all
incoming freshmen to take a
diagnostic writing examination.

The testing, according to David

Bartholomae of the English de-
partment, would distinguish writ-
ing-and reading skill levels and
serve as a mechanism for ﬁnding
students who need remedial work.

Students with such problems

‘would then be advised to take

courses designed to improve
reading and writing skills.

A decision would have to be
made, Bartholomae _ added,-
whether’ to make the exams» an
admission requirement.

He said a required program of
composition and reading courses
could give tremendous support to
the student and adequately address
students’ writing problems.

Bartholomae pointed out that
while 80 percent of students take

' writing courses of their own choice

while at Pitt, “it was very
disappointing when (only) 50

  Budget Increase Requests Questioned by Legislators

medical school students loans will be forgiven if they serve
high need areas of the state,” Wilbum said.

Some state representatives questioned whether budget
requests of the state-related universities were realistic in
light of the deficit and other budget problems Pennsylvania
faces. Representative Ronald R. Cowell, D-Penn Hills said
the 18 percent increase requested by the universities could
not be expected because of state budget problems.

“I think the 18 percent that the universities requested

was unrealistic, and I was surprised that they asked for
that. Ithink that a six or seven percent increase could be
sought and would be more realistic,” Cowell said.
5 Representative Fred A. Trello, D-Corapolis, said he
believed Pitt and other state-related universities do not
receive enough money, but that funds are not spent to
benifit students.

“The money for the universities could be better spent to
lower tuition. We don’t give enough to the universities,

A but the money still isn’t spent correctly." Trello said.

Trello, who headed a special committee that attempted
to investigate spending at state-related universities, cited
the house with servants and staff for the presidents of Pitt
and Penn State as examples of waste.

Most representatives interviewed agreed that Pitt could
not give any more state funds beyond the $66’million
provided by the governor’s suggested budget. Stephen
Freind, R-Delaware, a ‘member of the education and
appropriations committees, echoed other legislators when
he said, “I would like the appropriation to Pitt to be higher,
but within constraints of the budget I don’t think the
appropriation is bad.”

Thornburgh’s budget also calls for wholesale sales tax on
gasoline that would add three cents a gallon to gas prices.
Thornburgh supports continuation of special .2 percent
increase in the personal income tax and a one percent
increase in the capital income tax that were to expire this

ear.
y House Minority Whip James Manderino. D-Westmore-
land, immediately attacked the continuation of the income
tax increases on the House floor after Thornburgh’s
speech. He said the move would actually be a tax increase.

“The taxes that must be enacted will generate $195
million in revenue. It appears to be just equal to the new
initiative of some $200 million in the governor’s budget,”
Manderino said.

He said that a budget without" continuation of the income

tax increases and the gasoline tax, would contain a seven

percent revenue increase that should be enough to meet
Pennsylvania's needs.

In response to Manderino, House Majority Leader
Matthew Ryan, R-Chester, said that the Thornburgh
budget presented new spending priorities to the
representatives. He argued that Thronburgh attempted to
deal with the problems of employment and education
caused by the Shapp administration. gr

“One of the things made reference to by Mr. Manderino
was that there were no new directions indicated in the
governor’s budget message,” Ryan said. . “I would
disagree with that, and it may very well be that I am
reflecting my own personal philosophy, which was created
when I first came to Harrisburg under Governor Scranton.

“At that time. I think Governor Scranton found the
commonwealth in the same shape that Governor
Thornburgh ﬁnds it in today—a job crisis particularly. At
that time the governor addressed the problem of priorities
and paid particular attention to jobs and‘ business
incentives to create jobs, and I see the same theme in
Governor 'Fhornburgh’s speech.”

Women Learn Corporate Ladder

PITTSBURGH’-—Corporate' ladders traditionally have
been crowded with male climbers, but Gulf Oil Corp.
Thursday launched a pilot program to help women get a leg
up on the way to the top.

Through a two-month project, 50 selected women will be

“Women have been criticized constantly for having a
narrow perspective, but that’s because they haven’t had
the facts,” said Betty Lehan Harragan, author of “Games
Mother Never Taught You: Corporate Gamesmanship for
Women.”

“Women need a lot of help and Coaching in the business
world...basic coaching men have had as little kids,” she
said at a news conference.‘

Participants in the program were selected on the basis of
career interest, job performance, completion of at least one
year of college work, but without a degree, and one year’s
service with Gulf. ’

Gulf hopes to extend the program to all female
employees, and eventually to men if the project is
successful, said Gerald W. Bush, senior vice president for
human resources.

The program, designed inppart by Chatham College, also

Iranians Severe Relations With 3. ‘Africa

TEHRAN, lran——-Iran’s revolutionary government
severed diplomatic relations with South Africa on Sunday
because of its racial policies and conﬁrmed it will cut off the
white minority-ruled country’s vital Iranian oil supplies.

In another step toward restoring Islamic traditions in
Iran, the government also announced that women will no
longer be drafted into the Iranian armed forces for military
training.

The state radio said South Africa’s consul-general was
summoned to the Foreign Ministry and informed of the
decision to end government-to-government ties between
the two countries. The diplomat will leave Iran on Monday,
the report said.

Before revolution cut off Iranian oil exports to the world,
South Africa received an estimated 90 percent of its
petroleum from the government of Shah Mohammad Reza
Pah-lavi, who ignored international pressure to ban oil

sales as a protest against South Africa’s apartheid policies.

The South Africans, aware of their vulnerability to oil
embargoes, are known to have stockptled massive amounts

of oil in recent years, and are believed to be buying
higher—priced oil through middlemen on the open market.

Bureau Reports on Chain Letters

WASHINGTON-——They’re back again, those promises of
riches that beneﬁt a few and cheat many: chain letters.

The national Council of Better Business Bureaus reports
that chain letters are coming back into vogue, with the
newest twist the “circle letter.”

This particular scheme asks the recipient to pay $50 for
the letter and to send $50 to the first person on the list of
12. The buyer then removes the top name, adds hisjor her
own at the bottom, and sells two copies to recover the
$100 investment. ,

Then, the pitch says, they can just sit back and wait for
the money to roll in when the letters spread to more and
more people and their name climbs to the top.

The Better Business Bureaus note that the chain almost

' always gets broken and the letters die out quickly,

resulting in a profit only for the people who start the letter.
Also, it can be tough to sell those letters, and if they aren’t
sold, your name never gets into circulation, ending your
chance to make any money.

Opinion

  Doomed From
’ The Start

The College of Arts and Sciences Council voted the
Alternative Curriculum Program down once again
Wednesday—-this time for good. But‘, it seems CAS
Dean Irwin‘ J. Schulman and other Pitt officials
voted the program out long ago. The program was
not even included in the 1979 fall term course
description and time schedule booklets that were
constructed in January. , '

‘ Last Tuesday Schulman sent a letter to The Pitt

‘News explaining his reasons for excluding the

program in the booklets.
“I thought it would be easy to recruit students for

' "the Alternative Curriculum program by other means ’

if CAS Council and I decided to keep the program.
“It would be a simple matter to inform advisors in

good time if Alternative Curriculum were in fact
retained. But, since I though there was a good chan-
‘ce that the program could not be retained, I removed
its listing to avoid accidental registrations.”

Just want are Schulman’s “other means?” Did he
plan‘ to post program descriptions on crowded
bulletin boards next to fraternity party, concert and
movie advertisements? Maybe these posters could be
pasted throughout the Cathedral during the first
week of fall term, when masses of undecided students
scurry to and from the ninth floor. Perhaps the full
purpose of the program could be explained in a
notice buried among the ads inThe Pitt News?

Would it not have been just as easy to include a
description of Alternative Curriculum in the
booklets, and then, if the program were cancelled,
have advisors inform interested students?

By denouncing Schulman’s attitude to this whole
affair, we are not defending Alternative Curriculum
as a viable program. There are only 20 students
enrolled and quite possibly costs were too high.
Budget cuts throughout the university were ‘made in
December and more and deeper cuts this year are ap-
parent. Schulman’s reasons for killing the program
were professional. ‘

But the way Schulman hurried the issue through. _

council was most unprofessional. A vote taken by
council Feb. 23 assured continuation by a 5-4-1 vote.
Then, after the meeting, the abstaining vote decided
to change to “nay” and Schulman (violating
Robert’s Rules of Order) voted to break the tie.
He cast his vote in the negative and created a 6-5 tally
against the program. Later, admitting a “tactical

Wednesday with the 5-4 vote.

Schulman said, “Council does not take the matter

of the program lightly.” He was certainly correct.
It took council at least three votes to officially kill it.

We cannot change council’s vote or Schulman’s
thinking on the matter. We can only welcome the
new CAS dean to the administration. He has gone

Jimmy Carter and the ‘Presidential Pain’

‘By VINCENT ORNATO, JR.

My nine-year-old brother and I

~ visited my Uncle Harry yesferday.

Harry had just been released from

the hospital after his hemorrhoid ..

operation.

When we came home from
Harry’s, my brother rushed into
the living room and furiously
ﬂipped through the newpapers.

“What are you looking for?” I
asked. '

‘_‘Uncle Harry’i‘s story.”

“His what?”

“The story about Uncle Harry’s
hemroy operation.”

“Billy,” I said, “they don’t put
hemorrhoid operations in the
paper.”

“Yessir.

They put Jimmy

I Carter’s operations in it.”

‘ ‘That’ s different. ’ ’

“Why?”

“Because he's the president.
And people want to read about
him." 1

“People want to read about

Jimmy Carter’s hemroy’s but not
Uncle Harry’s?”

“People want to read about
anything the President does, or at
least the newspaper editors think
they do.”

“Does Jimmy Carter walk
bowlegged like Uncle Harry?” _

“Ah--I guess he does.”

“Does Jimmy Carter scream
when he goes to the bathroom like
Uncle Harry?”

I laughed out loud. Carter must
have gone through all the agony
Uncle Harry suffered. The
newspapers merely wrote how “the
President is feeling better” and of
a “successful operation.” They

‘ neglected the real interesting

item--the presidential pain.
Could you imagine the White

House with the president waddling ‘

around?

Rosalynn Carter, Amy and Miss ”
tLillian are sitting at the dining
table as Jimmy waddles in for‘

lunch, his first meal since his
release from the hospital.

“You ahr not smilin’, Jimmah,”
says Rosalynn.

“Why ahr yah walkin’ like a
duck, son?" askes Miss Lillian.

“Behcause I feel like I don’t have
a reah end, mothah,"" replies the
president. “Amy honey, could you
fetch Daddy’s towel from the Oval
Office? I’d forgotten it on the
chair.”

Amy leaves and returns with
daddy’s presidential hemorrhoid
towel. She hands it to Carter and
he folds it in half, then lies it on his
chair. He slowly eases himself into
the seat. \

“Son,” says Miss Lillian, “you
ahr movin’ slower than a peanut up
a mountain. It caint be that bad.”

“_Oh, it’s terrible.”

“To read the papers I’d think
you were on top of the world. They
have pictures of you grinning that
phony grin of yours. You look
happy as a lark.”

“Papers Mother?”

“Yes. The newspapers.”

“You mean they wrote about my
hemorrhoids in the newspapers?”

“Yes. Front page of the New
York Times.”

“Why must they do that? It's

not like John Wayne’s stomach

cancer or anythin’ interestin’.
Can’t they write on somethin’ more
impdhtant? Like what’s wrong
with Congress? Roz deah, call
Ruthie on the phone and tell her to
pray tonight for my public image,
would you?”

“Yes, dear,” answers Rosalynn.

“Why do the newspapers make
such a fuss? The ‘Merican people
can’t thing of their President with a
pain in his--”

The phone rang before Rosalynn
got to it. “Yes?” she said. “Yes,
He’s right here, I'll ask him.

Jimmah, Billah wants to know if he '

should cancel those ten cases of
Billah Beah you wanted him to get
at a discount.”

The president nodded.

“Yes, Billy, cancel it.
now." She hung up.

The food was brought in and
everyone had sausage and corn
except the president. He had

Bye

cottage cheese. “Roz, do I have to
eat this? Let me have just one
sausage."

“You know what the doctorsaid,
Jim,” replied the first lady.

A secret‘ service man entered
with a bag of groceries. “I brought
what you wanted sir. Toilet paper,
ginger ale, a box of ‘tucs’ and a jar
of Planters. Dry roasted.” ‘

“Give meh the Planters,” said‘

the president.
“No, Jimmy.” said Rosalynn.

“But I love Planters, Roz. Just a
few? '

‘ ‘ N 0, h o n . ’ ’ .

Carter’s operation was no
different than my Uncle’ Harry’s.
And the president probably did yell
when he went to the bathroom.

As my little brother watched the
news on TV., hoping for a story
about Uncle Harry, I decided he is
right. Uncle Harry’s operation is
every bit as interesting as
Carter’s--which is not at all.

College of Arts and Sciences
Dean Irwin Schulman’s letter
explaining his deletion of the
Alternative Curi'iculum program
from the course description showed
either a lack of’ creativity or no
knowledge of what students use
course descriptions and the Advis-
ing Center for.

If Shulman really thought it

“would be easier to .recruit.

students for the program by other
means” he must be very silly. Stu-
dents pick classes from the course
description and if the courses
aren’t there it is very difficult to
know they exist. To expect
individual advisors to be public
relations people for the program is
also ridiculous, although historic
lack of financial support and
publicity for the program — has
forced some of them into that role.

It would have made more sense

in
van

to put the program in the course
description and time schedule and,
if the program was terminated,
‘then tell adivisors not to let anyone
register for it just as they do with
cancelled classes. This would have
made more sense and also been
unbiased.

Alternative Curriculum was not
evaluated fairly and the admini-
stration had decided long‘ before
CAS Council to kill the program.
Shulman was biased in his role as
clean on this issue. This is not the
first cutback against student
interest. With Schulman and
Rosenberg in charge, I doubt it will
be the last.

-......._,,......--uuag oapa, nn.v 1

Recently _we have heard much
about teaching quality, the value of
research and the sincerity of
students in education. Pitt is an
institution which does consider all
of these things more than valuable
as can be seen by the concern
taken to address the ‘ﬁroblems in
education. Only healthy, maturing

A individuals take time for this type

of critical evaluation, and it is these
people who better the institutional
process.

After looking at many of these

1' considerations, I would like to offer

another perspective. I am a
student from a neighboring insti-
tution and have availed myself to
usage of the cross registration

system between local universities.

Ihave taken ﬁve courses at Pitt, sat
in on others, and have many
friends’ at ‘the university. Because
of this, I have developed my own
view of the situation.

In my opinion, one needs to
realize that very infrequently are
students or faculty ever completely
satisﬁed with a class section.
That's only natural if we are to
admit that we are limited bein‘gs.

In last Wednesday’s (March
7) The Pitt News, the sentence
. . . to perpetuate boundaries . .
. the dissemination of infor-
mation was accidentally ommit-
. ted from a letter by Karen
Steed. The ﬁnal paragraph of
her letter should have correctly
read:

Such an exchange between
professors seems to be an
expression of a disturbing
non-integrational approach to
education, one which through
jargon and information mono-
poly finds it easier to per-
petuate boundaries than to
break them down; thus, it
discourages dialogue and the
dissemination of information.
But, I am not an education
major and it is, of course,
presumptuous for me to spec-
ulate further. A simple call to
an expert in the education
department should get me the

Correction,

correct, up-to—date view on the
matter. A

The Pitt News regrets the
error.

But this should not be a step in
rationalization and in making us
content with imperfection. We
need to look at the cause of that
lack we suffer as people in
education. '

Many courses at various levels in
the undergraduate curriculum take
advantage of using graduate
teaching assistants and fellows.
This can be extremely advan-
tageous to departments. faculty,
and students. But it is not a secret
that students have suffered be-
cause of various assistants not
being extremely ﬂuent with the
English language. I in no way
intend to insult these people, but
in all honesty, how can I be aided
by one with whom I cannot
adequately communicate, no mat-
ter what theirlother qualifications
may be.

Beyond this, undergraduate
students make up the numerical
majority at Pitt. "There are also

that so often the undergraduate
has little contact with these faculty

course work for a B.A. in

the advancement of others, but
most of those involved in a

university are searching .for an
education. When research im-
pedes quality teaching, we are
failing to better ourselves and
society. May I suggest that more
critical evaluation be undertaken of
instructors in general. Evaluations
should not only be made by request
of a department or the faculty
member himself, but concerned
students should be able to have
evaluations undertaken. Those
who are seen to be unqualiﬁed for a
teaching position should be re-

leased from that responsibility.

despite their tenure. This would
cause hardship for“ some, but
would be for the common good of
the educational system.

Let us remember that education
does not simply come through
books and lecture, but the serious
reflection of maturing human
beings.

 A DynamicSax Marks Raphael
Ravenscroft’s Debut’ Album

./‘~ ' By SAM ROSSI

Pitt News Staff Writer
Her Father Didn’t Like Me Anyway
Raphael Ravenscroft
Portrait ~

Glib is probably the best word to
describe the Raphael Ravenscroft
sax. Flitting in and out of
arrangements, it »gives songs an

\\ appealing delicacy.

\

“Her Father Didn’t Like Me
Anyway” is Ravenscroft’s debut as
a single performer. He is possibly
best known for his dynamic /sax
work on Gerry Rafferty’s “Baker
’C.£reet.”

The album presents a nice
well-rounded selection of jazz, rock
’n’ roll, blues and funk with and
without vocals. Song offerings
come from Ravenscroft’s friend
Rafferty, Paul McCartney, J.
Zawinul of Weather Report and
others.

The music is rather symphonic in
quality. Ravenscroft has incorpor-

ated extensive string and brass
accompaniment into most of the
material.

The album opens with “Whole
Lotta Something Goin’ On.” The
song builds from a soft introduction
into an ~up—tempo soul piece. Ron
Boromeo’s vocals are particularly
effective.

“You Put Something Better
Inside Me” opens with a full-
bodied saxsolo by Ravenscroft that
constitutes one of the album’s
premiere performances.

Ravenscroft displays his versatil-
ity in the jazz-oriented number
titled “Country Preacher” as well
as “Beautiful Woman,” where he
adds ﬂute accompaniment.

The title cut “Her Father Didn’t
Like Me Anyway” borders between
jazz and classical. Once again,
Ravenscroft takes up the ﬂute for a
nice contrast to the previous
material.

Side two begins with the funky
“Sex and Drugs and Rock ’n’

Roll.’’ The interplay between the
brass section and voice box makes
the cut one of the album’s
standouts.

The rocking,“You Make Me Feel
Sixteen” follows. Ravenscroft’s sax
part complements the vocals of
Boromeo superbly here.

Another funk - number titled
“Give It All You Got” follows. The
album's best offering “Every
Night” is next and its arrangement
and sax work is unparalleled in any
of Ravenscroft’s work.

“Summer Nights” closes the
album with a_ brisk big band sound
and another of the album’s
standouts. K

Comparatively speaking, the
music on “Her Father Didn’t Like
Me Anyway” lies somewhere
between the defunct David San-
born Band and The Average White
Band at its peak. It’s a very good
album and a worthwhile addition to
jazz and funk collectors.

Britain ’s Poodles

Mirror Stars
Fabulous Poodles
Epic

The Fabulous Poodles, better
known by their promoters and
groupies as Fab Poos, is another
England-based, new wave sound
group that is trying to escape the
confines of tiny Great Britain. So
they come to America, the land of
opportunity, to release their
garbage in the form of albums, this
one called “Mirror Stars."

The Poodles are a group of four
guys who don’t seem to understand
the concept of music. The classical
mandolin is treated like a third-rate

depicting the hardships of unem-
ployment.

The title cut is typical of the new
British sound. Simplistic guitar
leads, _a primitive drum beat, and
vocals to match.

Poodles’ fatal attempt at reggae.

Most comedy films appeal to a
wide range of audiences, but some
fail due to the nature of their
theme.

“Fastbreak,” a Stephen Fried-

latter category.

every win his team has and, if he
arranges and wins a game with
top-ranked Nevada State, he'll
receive a $30,000 a year, 3-year
contract.

Greene decides to accept the
proposition and immediately plu-
nges into the task of selecting a
team that would have a chance
beating Nevada State.

What follows is a predictable
arrangement of circumstances that
culminate in the acquisition of 4
outstanding basketball players.

Area Band Has
Great Potential
With First Album

By FORREST BUFFENMYER

Pitt News Staff Writer

Pittsburgh has never really had
the reputation as a producer of
good, popular rock talent, that New
York or San Francisco has. Sure, -
some names are big--like George
Benson, Dion and the Belmonts,
and the Skyliners, as well as Lou

‘ Christie and Tommy James and the

Shondells. But no premiti"m rock
band comes to mind.

Well, now the city has a chance.
The group is the Granati Brothers

 and, with their debut album, titled

“G Force,” they are out to prove

E themselves.

This ﬁve-man Beaver Falls group
is composed of four brothers and a
cousin: Hermie on keyboards,
Ricky on drums, Joey on syn-
thesizer, David on rhythm and lead
guitars and Tony Lee Bonomo with
additional drums and percussion.

All share vocal duties, which
brings up the nicest point of this
album. Unlike many debut bands, -
the Granatis never totally emulate
others’ styles. Rather, they take a
style and copy it to a small degree,
adding their own distinctive
touches.

player Bernard King of the New

lends “Fastbreak” any credibility.

A ‘ rather unorthodox fourth

It’s Roberta ‘Bobbi’ James, a girl

It’s for this reason she is referred to

‘Murder b

By JOHN RIGHETTI
Pitt_News Staff Writer
Murder by Decree
Directed by Bob Clark
AVCO Embassy Pictures

For those who ever wondered
who Jack the Ripper, London's
notorious unknown criminal, was,
here’s a chance to find out.

“Murder by Decree,” explores

. the identity of Jack the Ripper and

has him discovered by the world's

greatest detective Sherlock
Holmes.
(“Murder by Decree” is the

latest Holmes thriller to parade
from Hollywood. To say the least,
it is tremendous entertainment.
Anyone familiar with the old series
of Holmes ﬁlms starring Basil
Rathbone or with Conan Doyle’s
books will indeed notice a
difference right away. “Decree’s”
Sherlock is not the sleuthful
superman of old series or books.
He is much more human.

COMING: THE MAN WHO
‘ LOVED WOMEN, MARCH 14

But, the movie is as suspenseful
and intriguing as any Holmes
story. Holmes (Christopher Plum-

_ iner) and his cohort Dr. Watson

(James Mason), are hired by
members of radical, (anti-monarch-
ical) English party hoping to track
down Jack the Ripper. They come
to Holmes because they believe the
police will do nothing to help find
this killer, the murderer of only
poor women and prostitutes.

As things turn out, they are not
far from the truth. From the very
instant Holmes appears at the
scene of a murder, Sir Charles
Warren of Scotland Yard gives him
a hard time. He tries in every
possible way to discourage Holmes
from covering the case and even
threatens to arrest him on
trumped-up murder charges.

In his quest for the killer,
Holmes meets Robert Lees (Donald
Sutherland), a psychic who has
seen the killer in his dreams. He
describes the murders in detail to

 

Holmes, giving him clues until he
is silenced by Sir Charles.

From there, Holmes pieces
together little clues he has
accumulated and takes off in
another direction. He talks with
Mary Kelly (Susan Clark), a wench,
who discloses, some interesting
facts to him about men who are
out to get her and a friend who the
court physician has wrongly sen-
tenced to an insane asylum.

Holmes and Watson make the
trip to the asylum, talk to the
servant Annie Crook (Genevieve
Bujold), and grasp leads that
eventually take’ them to the killer
(or killers) in a series of ghastly,
and terrifying scenes on the streets
and wharfs of London.

Plummer is excellent as Holmes.
Calm and collected he portrays
Conan Doyle’s character to a tee.
But fortunately, Plummer adds to
Sherlock’s character emotions and
a crisp sense of humor.

  ENTERTAINMENT

What more can be said of Mason
in his career that hasn't already
been said? Never has Watson been
so accurately, yet so appealingly,
portrayed. It is Mason’s dry wit
and seriousness in lighter moments
that provide the much-needed
comic relief in the film. His
performance in scenes such as the
one in which a prostitute solicits
him is truly memorable.

Bujold excells in her small but
important role of Annie Crook, the
unjustly institutionalized woman.
She and Plummer are capable of
wringing tears from the audience in
a touching scene in which she
reveals her sad story.

Sutherland is almost unrecog-
nizable in the role of Lees. His
somber expression and eerie blue
eyes, surrounded by bushy red hair
and whiskers, mask his familiar
features. Sutherland does a
wonderful job. It’s easy to believe
he really does have psychic power.

“Murder by Decree’s” strongest
asset is its cinematography. The

camera is used to convey so much.

yDecree’  Vivid Holmes Film

Until the end, the audience never
sees the killer. Instead, tit‘-
audience is the killer; they are his
eyes as he stalks the streets of
London.

The murder scenes also display
ﬁne camera work. Each scene is
very hazy and in slow motion,
accentuating the agony of the
victims and the cruelty of the killer.

The screenplay closely follows
the Conan Doyle books on the
majority of details, establishing a
bewildering plot that grows more
tangled and mysterious with every
new development. ‘<

Finally, the soundtrack serves its
purpose well. There are some
really bizarre, almost deranged
chords in the eerie score that
complement the London tenement
scenery.

“Murder by Decree” is not the
old worn Sherlock Holmes mystery.
It’s a refreshing one.

Granati Brothers Debut Album

Two Fine Cuts Highlight Granati LP

(Continued from page 9)

The overall album is weak
in some areas, but, what the hey,
it’s only a first attempt.

This album was recorded (among
other places) at Jeree’s Studios in
New Brighton. Hermie Granati
wrote most of the material, and it is
all original. In most cases, the
lyrics need work, but the guitars
are strong and tight and the
rhythm section is as powerful as
any of recent.

Side one opens strongly with lots
of guitar balanced well with piano,
in “What in the World.” The
vocals here sound similiar to Robin
Zander of Cheap Trick.

The side closes with one of the
two truly excellent tracks on the
LP, “No Stone Unturned,” a tune
with overtones of Foreigner’s
“Feels Like the First Time,”
featuring slow, steady bass and
heavy guitar work.

There are several other tracks
between “What in the World,”

and “No Stone Unturned,”.. but
they are of the typical ﬁrst release
variety—good, but not up to the
quality of these two.

Side two opens with “Night,” a
reggae-style rocker, nearly a twin
to 10cc's “Dreadlock Holiday,”
with echo vocals and the usual
American-style reggae. (In fact, a
lot of the songs here, to some
degree, show a distinct 10cc
inﬂuence.)

The next cut, “Nothin’,” sounds
like reﬁned Boston.

“Make It Last” is also reggae,
but this time more Jamaican, with
a few of those personal touches
thrown in.

Another reggae tune follows with a
lot of backup synthesizer, giving it
a ﬂavor not unlike the Bee Gee’s
“Nights on Br,0adway," and
another McCartney-style piece is
similiar to “Monkberry Moon
Delight" in mood, direction, and
delivery.

Shows Flashes Of Professionalism

The strongest tune on the record,
“It Was You,” is next. Different
from the rest of the material, it
features heavy acoustic guitar and
nice chord progression. Its Paul
McCartney-style vocals (tinged
with Peter Gabriel) are very
reminiscent of the mid-Beatles of
1967-68.

Everything else is downhill.

Sometimes, the Granati Brothers
sound like they’re ahead of their
time. Sometimes they sound like‘
they’re 10 years too late. Decide
for yourself. Hopefully after this
offering they will give something
really great.

Wrest

By JIM LEWIS

Pitt News Staffwriter
AMES,lowa—-All four Pitt wrest-
lers who qualiﬁed for the NCAA
championships here were eliminat-
ed from title competition last night.

Panthers Glenn Maxwell (118
pounds), Jose Martinez (126), Tom
Jones (158) and Skip Bolin (167) all
lost in opening-day bouts and only
have a chance to compete in
consolation action in the three-day
tournament.

Maxwell, an Eastern Wrestling
League champion, was totally
eliminated from the ﬁeld with an
8-2 overtime loss to Indiana State’s
Angelo Marino in the ﬁrst round.

Martinez lost in the ﬁrst round to
Missouri’s Keith Moylan, 4-3, but
can qualify for the consolations if
Moylan advances to the semi-
ﬁnals.

Jones faced second-seeded Dan
Silverberg of Minnesota and lost,
14-6, but he also has a chance to
compete in the consolations if his
opponent advances.

Bolin won his ﬁrst-round match,
14-8, over Air Force’s Dale

Walters. But he fell in the second
round, pinned by Utah State’s
Mark Harris at 1:10. He can also
advance if Harris can reach the
semi-ﬁnals.

Pitt, which ﬁnished 20th in the
nation at the NCAAS last year, has
only earned one point so far and is
tied for 40th with several other
teams, including dual match foes
Ohio State and William & Mary.
Iowa State leads with 27 points.

“We just didn’t loosen up at
all,” assistant head coach Rande
Stottlemyer said. “We had
chances to open the matches up but
we were tight and wrestled a vey
conservative match. That’s not our
style at all.”

The Panthers aren’t the only
squad with problems—none of the
24 grapplers who qualiﬁed in the
EWL tournament were able to
reach the quarter-ﬁnal round.

“Everyone in our league seems
super-tight,” Stottlemyer said.
“Maybe it’s the awe of the big
tournament (wrestling draws over
10.000 fans at Iowa State).’’

Veterans Tressler, Bachuchin Ready for Gym Regionals

Twosome, Team Aspiring
For National Championships

Bonnie Tressler performs in the floor exercise.

By JEFF DUROSKO
Pitt News Staff Writer
Pitt gymnasts Bonnie Tressler
and Myra Bachuchin are no

strangers to national competition.
The two sophomores participated
in the Association of Intercollegiate
Athletics for Women (AIAW)
championships last year in Seattle.

Tressler and Bachuchin, along
with their Pantherette teammates,
are hoping to make it to nationals
later this month at Penn State. But
ﬁrst, they must qualify at regionals
at Maryland.

“Both Bonnie and Myra gained
valuable experience by competing
in nationals last year,” said coach
Donna DeMarino Sanft. “There is
more ceremony, more excitement
there than at a regular meet or at
regionals. ‘

Sanft said the two gymnasts are
looking forward to Pitt qualifying
for nationals as a team, rather than
individually.

“When there are only two
gymnasts there from your school,

it’s a lot harder to get up for a

meet, ” she said.
feeling . ’ ’

“It’s a lonely

Both Tressler and Bachuchin
have been competing in gymnastics
for over 10 years, and each has her
own specialty. Tressler’s is the
balance beam and Bachuchin‘s is
the vault.

“I like the beam because it is the
easiest event for me,” said
Tressler. “It’s easier to express
yourself through dance, which I
feel is my strongest area.”

The Monessen native added that
the‘vault is her weakest event.
Tressler said going to nationals
last year provided her with very
good experience because she “got
to see a lot of good people.”

Bachuchin, also from Monessen.
said that, while she enjoys the vault

and is strong in it, her weakest
event is the floor exercise.

“Because of my injury,” she
said, “I’ve just gotten back to
tumbling and have been having a
little trouble in the ﬂoor.”

Both Pantherettes are concerned
with the entire team’s performance
in the upcoming easterns and
nationals.

“I just want to try and help the
team as much as I can,” said
Bachuchin. “It’s a disappointment
because I haven’t been competing
this year due to a toe injury and
haven't been able to contribute to
the team.”

Tressler said that Pitt has a good
chance to make nationals, but that
it all depends on the regionals.

“I hope I can hit everything,”
she said. “I hope the whole team
hits. If everyone does, we will have
a good chance to make nationals.”

Sanft said that mentally, Bach-
uchin is in as good shape as she
would be if she had competed all
season and that she should so well
in both the vault and uneven bars
at regionals.

“Bonnie (Tressler) and Holly
(Martino) are the only two
gymnasts who have been going
all-around all season," Sanft said.
“Bonnie should be feeling tired,
but thus far hasn't shown it at all.
She has one of the best beam
routines in the East and should
place high.”

Bachuchin said that since there
have been a number of injuries on
the team this season, there has
been more of a team effort.

“Everyone is working to get to
nationals,” she said. “I hope that
we make it. If so, I'd like to place
in the top eight——to make a good
showing and impress some peo-
ple.”

  Pitt Swimmer Schuman

By KAREN KADILAK

Pitt News Staff Writer

' Mark Schuman led Pitt’s swim-

mers (10-0) to their fourth straight
Eastern championship last week-
end by winning two individual
events and swimming on two
victorious relay teams.

It was a good showing, but"

Schuman ﬁgures his best is yet to
come.

“I had my best times of the
season in the Easterns, but I know I
can improve,” said the senior from
Philadelphia. “I was not fully
tapered, but I will be for the
NCAAs.” '

In the Easterns, Schuman
finished first in the 100-yard
butterﬂy. the 200-yard individual
medley, the 400-yard freestyle
relay, and the 400-yard medley
relay, qualifying for next week-
end’s National Collegiate Athletic
Association (NCAA) championship
in each event.

“I probably won’t be seeded as
well, but I think I can do better in
the NCAAs this year than I did last
year,” said Schuman, who, in last
season’s NCAA championship,
missed making All-America by
100th of a second in the 100-yard
butterﬂy.

“This will be my fourth’ NCAA
championship,” Schuman said.
“I’m a lot more relaxed for this one
than I've been for the other three.

“The NCAA championship is
probably the toughest sports’
toughest meet," Schuman con-
tinued. “It's even harder than the
Olympics. Once you make the
United States Olympic team,
you're already one of the top five
swimmers in the world. But in the
NCAAs, everyone is good." .

Schuman admits that he used to
be “awestruck" when competing
in the NCAAs, but not anymore.
He considers himself as good as, if.
not better than, many of the

swimmers at whom he gawked as a
freshman.

“I’m hoping to make All-Ameri-
ca in both the 100-yard butterﬂy
and the 400-yard medley relay,”

Schuman said. “I think I can finish
in the top six in the 100-yard

butterﬂy. We may even crack the
top six in the 400-yard medley
relay." (Along with Schuman, Stu
Swanson, Mike-Connor, and Rick
Carter will swim on the 400-yard
medley relay.)

Schuman is pleased with the way

he has been swimming this season.
“I'm more consistent than I've
been in the past, although I haven’t
had any exceptional times,"
Schuman said. “Hopefully, I've
saved my best times for the
NCAAs.”
SWIM NOTES: Pat Greenwell, the

most valuable diver in Pitt’s
capture of the Eastern swimming
championship, and Scott Winkler
are competing in the Eastern
diving championship this weekend
at Harvard. The top scorers in this

championship advance to the
NCAAs.

Other ﬁrst-round games tonight
are:

. East Regional at Raleigh, N.C.—

Utah, 20-9, vs. Pepperdine, 21-9,
and Southern California, 19-8, vs.
Utah State, 19-10.

Second round games will be
played Saturday. .

Coach Ed Byhre of Eastern
Kentucky, 21-7, isn’t dwelling on
history and he isn’t looking past
Tennessee, 20-11, to a second-
round game against ﬁfth-ranked
Notre Dame.

“Our philosophy is playing one
game at a time,” said Byhre.
“That’s the only way you can
concentrate on what’s got to be
done. Too many teams think ahead
to where they want to be and then

never get anywhere in the first

place.”

Tennessee’s DeVoe, however
has more on his mind than just
Eastern Kentucky. .

“We’re building a tradition of
our own, starting a new era of
Tennessee basketball and it would
be only proper for us to win
Tennessee’s first NCAA game. In
fact, we’ve got the talent to win
several games.”

Lamar coach Bill Tubbs says the
only differencqabetween his team
and Detroit “is we haven’t beaten
anybody ranked.” But he added,
“I think it’s probably our turn now.
We may be number 40 in a ﬁeld of
40 but we’re in the NCAA
playoffs.”

“We deserve: to be in the
tournament,” said Detroit coach
Dave Gaines, whose Titans beat
11th-ranked Georgetown and num-
ber 12 Marquette in the regular
season. ,

Temple has already beaten St.
John’s this season, but the game
doesn’t make Temple coach Don
Casey feel good.

“St. John’s is a total team,” said

Casey. “They’re playing even
more total now than. they were
when we played them before.”

But St. John’s is coming off a
loss to Iona while Temple is coming
off the championship of the East
Coast Conference tournament.

At least one Temple player felt
that the Owls shouldn't have to
play St. John’s——or anybody
else——-in the first round.

“I think we should have drawn a
bye,” said Temple guard Rick
Reed. “I think our record was
deserving of it.”

Iona rode into the tournament
behind two highly-recruited New
York metropolitan-area players,
sophomores Jeff Ruland, who
averaged 24.6 points a game, and
junior guard Glenn Vickers.

The opponent doesn’t matter to
Penn. Nor does the site.

“I’d rather be playing in North
Carolina than be shipped out to
Tennessee or Kansas or some-
where else,” said Penn co-captain
‘Bobby Willis. “I'm just looking
forward to the tournament. I think

* our team has been ready _for some

time and I think. it has shown in the.
way-we played late in the season."

Virginia Tech and Jacksonville
will play not only for a chance of
advancement in the Midwest but
for a crack at making big headlines.
The winner meets unbeaten top-
ranked Indiana State in the first
round, a team which has beaten
New Mexico State three times
already this season.

New Mexico State coach Ken
Hayes knows the best game his
team played so far this year. That
was a 63-57 victory overWeber
State in the All-College Tourna-
ment at Oklahoma~City. .

Weber State coach Neil McCar-
thy found out two things in that
game. .

“We know that they are a ﬁne
team, but we also know that we
didn’t play’our best against them
the first time around,” McCarthy
said.

Pepperdine and Southern Cal-
ifornia will have extra incentive to
give it the old college try in their
West Regional games against Utah
and Utah State, respectively.
Coaches Bob Boyd of Southern Cal
and Gary Colson announced some
time ago that this would be their
ﬁnal campaigns.

Boyd is pleased with his team’s
recent performance of six regular-
season ending victories in a row.
But he’s not counting number 7
until it’s on the score board.

“What I found signiﬁcant is that
they (Utah State) have already
beaten four teams in the NCAA
tourney——Brigham Young, Utah,
Paciﬁc and Weber State,” said
Boyd. “That gives them cred-
ibility.”
