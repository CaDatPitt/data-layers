Sweethearts at
Tuesday Dance

The Inter—Fraternity Winter
Carnival Ball will open the Christ-
mas holiday season next Tuesday
at the William Penn hotel.

Claude Thdrnhill and his orch-
estra, acclaimed the best band in
the country by Look magazine,
will be on hand to make sure that
fraternity members get into the
festive mood.

Decorations representing the
Christmas season will liven up the
hotel’s main ballroom and Urban
Room. The Christmas spirit will
be augmented by the crowning of
18 fraternity “sweethearts.”

While Thornhill is playing his
c1assically—styled dance music in
the main ballroom, Everett _Neill
and his KDKA staff orchestra will
take care of the expected over-
ﬂow crowd in the Urban Room.

Parents of the 18 “sweethearts”
will be on hand during intermis-
sion to witness the crowning cere-
mony.

Permissiown has been granted
fraternity members to serve
breakfast to their dates following
the dance—an innovation in Pitt
affairs. Breakfast will be served
in the fraternity houses until
2:30 a.m.

In charge of the various com-
mittees under Chairman Bill Saus-
ser, Delta Sigma Phi, are Jim Du-

_ chene, Publicity, Pi Kappa Alpha;

Al Solomon, Business, Phi Epsilon
Pi; Jack Lindsey, Decorations,
Theta Chi; and Myron Berman,

4 Invitations, Kappa Nu.

The formal affair will start at
9. p.m. and end at 1 a.m. Tickets
may be obtained from fraternity
salesmen for $5. The dance is

open only to fraternity members.

Pre-Registration Kits
Aid In Getting Cards

, By BOB THOMAS
E. A. Batchelder, assistant registrar, has again stressed his re-
quest that students bring their pre-registration kits to classes on
Jan. 5 and 6. The registrar’s office mailed out 17,000 of these kits
yesterday to the st~uden.ts’A homes.

Instructors will have class cards for continuation of courses on

 

Jan. 5 when they will be distrib-9
uted during class periods. Cards
for classes which are held earlier
in the week will be passed out on
those days. Students are required
to schedule themselves in the same
sections in continuation courses.

The Pitt catalogue lists actual
registration as running from Feb.
2 to-8. Actually it will be con-
cluded on Feb. '7.

On Monday, Feb. 7, all uncol-
lected pre-registration envelopes
will be broken down and the class

Bus Ad SIudenI's Poent Wins

Place in Book of College Verse

Success has been achieved in the ﬁeld of poetry by John Kuzara,
business administration. His poem, “Rejoice,” has been accepted by
a national publication, the Anathology of College Poetry.

The Anthology is a compilation of “the ﬁnest poetry written by
college men and women.” It represents every section of the country
with selections having been made from thousands of poems »that

were submitted.

Kuzara Wrote his ﬁrst poetry as
a routine assignment in English
122, where he received his first
encouragement.

His instructor, Miss Flora Bram-
son, read one of his early poems
submitted as class work and was
attracted to it. She encouraged
him to continue his work under
her guidance.

Since that time he has gradu-
ally built up a small collection of
compositions written during his
spare time. His prize-winning
work, “Rejoice,” was written early
last summer.

The poem itself is an account
of Kuzara’s feeling about the war

h.Physl Eds Slip me,

To Alcoholic Anonymous Five

Led by the “Sharpshooter Trio,”
the Phys Ed 5’s continued in their
winning ways by swamping a
good but outclassed Alcoholics
Anonymous ﬁve, 62-15, this week.
Hitting for over three-fourths of
their shots, Rudy Hudec, Al Lochi-
kar and Dick Kost were too much
for the much shorter A.A. team.

Rudy Hudec kept up his high
scoring spree by tossing in 11 ﬁeld
goals and two fouls for 24 points.
He was aided by Dick Kost, ex-
Swissvale ace, and A1 Lochikar,
former Sharon cage star, as both
dropped in eight ﬁeld joals for
16 points.

The Phys Eds are one of the
strongest teams in the league
along with the Gophers, who also
won their second straight by
downing a hard ﬁghting Zookie

quintet, 36-27. It was _a close
hard fought contest all the way.

The winner of the game was in
question until the ﬁnal few min-
utes when Bob Badke slipped in
for three straight ﬁelders to put
the contest on ice. Badke, a dead
shot from in close, also led the
scoring with 20 points. Lanky
Meyer Moskovitz was high man
for the losers with 11.

Johnstown Association got back
on the winning road with a deci-
sive, 32-28, victory’ over the Pros.
Once more it was little Don Leti-
zia (5-3), who was the spark
plug for the winners. Letizia
snapped the cords with seven ﬁeld
goals and two fouls for 16 points.

The stars of the day were big
Rudy Hudec of the Phys Eds and

little Don Letizia of J ohnstown.

Ancl Munching Into Southland

By MYRON KOPELMAN _
The Mason-Dixon Line curled up into a ﬁgure eight yesterday
as Dr. H. C. Carlson and his ice cream eaters went munching into

the Southland.

The Pitt players, reportedly put on a strict diet of Dixie Cups,
are headed for Miami, _Florida, where they will take their annual
Christmas and New Year’s Day vacation—and, incidentally. play

a little basketball.

The “Jolly Boy” issue of the
Panther was jolly enough, from
all indications.

On sale at 8:30 Wednesday
morning, by late afternoon all
2800 copies were sold and circu-
lation men of the monthly maga-
zine were digging in.to their stock
of copies marked for exchange
with other schools.

There was a lot of comment on
the issue, and most of it seemed
to center about the Overseas Page,
a recent innovation of the Panther.

Head Panther John Schnapp
modestly declined full credit for
the page, saying “It was a staff
project.” Panther staffers were
kept busy all day Wednesday pat-
ting themselves on the back.

Someone, as yet unidentiﬁed,
was heard to remark that next
month's Overseas Page might ring
with authenticity; the writers
would be writing from overseas.

To introduce practical experience to his students in Water Trans-
portation, Charles A. Williams has in the past month taken his class

on two trips.
On Nov. 18, the class visited

the Dravo Corporation on Neville

Island. Here they observed the latest developments in building the

large river barges.

“The building of these barges has almost approached assembly-

Scholar’s Day is highlighted by
a special program set aside for

To head this program, Student
Congress has delegated to the Ap-

eiine efficiency,” Mr. Williams said.
After a tour of the plant, the
students attended a conference

with top officials of the corpora-
tion in which they discussed most
of the phases dealing with the
building of water transportation
equipment.

The ‘U. S. Army Corps of En-
gineers sponsored a ﬁrst trip,
taken on Nov. 2.

On a launch provided by the en-
gineers, the students sailed down
the Ohio river, observing locks
and dams as they passed through
them.

“We were very fortunate,”
stated Mr. Williams, "in being able
to observe the locks at an excep-
tionally close range.”

After lunch the students trav-
eled overland to lock No. 8. Here
and in the near vicinity they saw
wicket or movable dams, miter or
the swinging gate type of dam,
and the roller type at lock No. 8.

The students also saw the load-
ing and unloading of river barges

W But for the kindness of Dr. Tad-
eusz Lipiec and Dean Herbert E.
Longenecker, Joseph Poborski, a
student from Poland, would have
changed his mind about going to
Pitt.

When Joseph arrived in Pitts-
burgh, he stood at a hotel in the
midst of the busiest section of the
downtown triangle. The rush and
noise was nerve wracking to Jo-
seph, who was used to a much
calmer atmosphere.

Then after a walk in the Hill

district, he was even more dis-.

mayed by the way people live in
this section. Altogether he wanted
to leave Pittsburgh and join his
colleague‘ who was enrolled at
the University of Pennsylvania.
It was only when Dr. Lipiec, a
visiting professor in chemistry at
Pitt, took Joseph; in tow that he
began to get a more complete idea
of what Pittsburgh and American

life was like. Dr. Lipiec took ‘Jo-

seph ﬁrst to the Cathedral where
he introduced him to Dean Longe-
necker, head of the graduate
school, and Joseph was so im-
pressed with the beauty of the
Cathedral and the warm welcome
'of Dean Longenecker that he was
willing to stay in Pittsburgh for
these reasons alone.

Then after Dr. Lipiec took his
friend from Poland on a tour of
the city and showed him that

ful sections and that most people

Joseph gained a much more fa’v-'
orable impression of our city and
American life.

This is important since Joseph
will be passing on his impressions
of his stay here to the students he
will teach at the University of
Cracow, the largest university in
Poland.

It is this university, where Jo-
seph is to teach upon his return,

that has given him this opportun- .

ity to study at Pitt. Joseph, who
has a degree in mining and metal-
lurgic engineering, is-[taking as
many geology courses as he can
crowd into his nine month schol-
arship here. '

When comparing conditions in
the United States with that of
Poland today, Joseph is over-
whelmed by the contrast. Between
the passing‘ of the German and
Russian armies across Poland,
hardly a stretch of land was left
untouched by the war’s devasta-
tion. ‘

Since Joseph has come to this
country, he has felt like he has
