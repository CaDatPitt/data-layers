Until members of the Univer-
sity Inquiry Club entered G21

know that Daniel Rubin, their
speaker for the day, had been
named as director of the Commu-
nist Party’s national youth group
for the United States.

Dr. Hugh G. Cleland, history
professor and faculty advisor to
the club, said that he and the or-
ganization’s members “were com-
pletely unaware of Rubin’s back-
ground."

Cleland explained that the club

had been contacted by Rubin, who

introduced himself as the editor
of “New Horizons for Youth,” 21
national monthly paper, and offer-
ed to speak to the group.

Irresponsible Inquiry

This University is fast gaining distinction for its variety
of stimulating speakers. In the past the Inquiry Club has
concurred with this ﬁne programming by presenting lec-
turers who challenge students to think seriously on issues
of wide interest.

But just presenting speakers for the sake of conduct-
ing a program or because the speakers believe they have
something to say indicates a lack of responsibility on the

{part of the organizing groups on campus.

Last week the Inquiry Club, admittedly oblivious to his
background, introduced Daniel Rubin to the University
only as editor of the then relatively unknown “New Hori-
zons for Youth.” Results of the meeting pointed out the
possible affiliations of Rubin and his paper.

As Dr. Hugh Cleland, advisor to the group explained,
the above information did not anger the group as much as
“being tricked into presenting a speaker who deliberately
misrepresented himself and concealed his background.” For
anyone who has seen Rubin’s paper, his political leanings
are hardly so subtle as to be completely hidden from view.

But the Inquiry Club, again by its own admission, had
never seen the paper nor even heard of it. Nor_ did anyone
question it once Rubin brought it to their attention. Strange
that they should then accept its editor as a speaker just
erties. Some further background, if only for publicity rea-
because he believed he had something to say on Civil Lib-
sons, would have been the next logical step in the schedul-
ing program.

Actually, the very fact that Rubin told the Inquiry
members he was editor of the paper indicates that he was
not completely concealing his background -although he fail-
ed to mention his dealings with the Senate investigating
committee. Nevertheless, had some basic research been
done by the club, the tie—in would probably have been found
since someone did get enough information to mimeograph
background sheets on the man.

If the University intends to continue its liberal policy
of presenting speakers of all viewpoints to speak to the stu-
dents, then the groups in charge of arranging these pro-
grams must recognize their responsibility in at least know-
ing whom they are presenting and why.

Johnny Comes Marching Home . . . '

 

War Can Be Deadly

By Matt Sweionic

Now that the great political gods are once again
inching us ever nearer to another titanic world
struggle, we begin to see, ever more frequently,
those truly inspiring scenes as the ﬂower of Amer-
ican youth goes forth to make
the world safe for democracy.

Whether bus‘ terminal or
train station, the picture is the
same: Mother,‘ Father, sweet-
heart, victim, all wailing last
goodbyes as Johnny goes march-
ing oﬁ to save the’ world.

‘Once safe from the grips of
parents and friends with his
mother’s parting kisses still fresh
behind his wet ears, Johnny
begins to picture himself as the
stalwart protectorof such grandiose ideals as de-
mocracy, equality and the American way.

He envisions himself. performing great deeds

.of valor as he leads America on to its God—ord;lined

triumph over the ravages of Communism.

If he stops to consider death at all, which is,
unless this next war is to be grossly different
from the last, a distinct possibility, he considers
himself expiring at the head of a glorious charge
which completely obliterates his foe.

He is usually unaware of the disparity between
the glorious and inspiring passing imagined by the
young soldier and the messy ﬁnish that is normally
in store for him.

Dramatic. Death

The human tendency to make death dramatic
and heroic has little excuse in the facts. In a large
illustrated version of Winston Churchil1’s History
of the Second World War there is a full color print
of an American soldier during the invasion of some
Pacific Island whoihas just been hit in the side by
a Japanese artillery shell.

What one notices especially is the curious ex-
pression upon what remains of his face——-an ex-
pression of the utmost surprise and indignation.

No doubt he boarded his ship for the invasion
ﬁrmly convinced that, if he died at all, it would
be at the climax of some heroic charge, up to

More Important Than War . . .

 

his knees in expiring Japanese with his bayonet
run clear through a general of the highest order,
He imagined the clean bullet through‘ theheart,

the stately last gesture, the ﬁnal words: “Mary! 

Susan! Mother! America!” _
Go to the book and see what he really got. V
War is not the only field of human endeavor
where death turns out to be a farce. In every day
life the passing of the common man takes on an
aspect far removed from the personal sorrow it
causes, in fact, the hardest thing about death is

but that most of them die so ridiculously.

If it were possible for all of us to make our ex-
its at great moments in our lives, in such a man.
her that our death would be clean and swift, and
with an attitude of the highest ‘stature, then the
experience would be something to face with up-
lifted, heart and mind and with high and glorious
words. ‘

However, in most cases we go oﬁ in no such
gorgeous and "poetic way. Instead, we die in many
varied and odious methods-—-of cancer, of heart
attacks while cleaning out the garage, of a hundred
different liver troubles. A

Generating Gods

The gods of our generation upon whom \we

lavish our veneration reduce it to an absurdity by_

dying of lockjaw, or by choking on chicken bones
or malted milk.
Great generals who at one time were the heroes

of the nation are run down by garbage trucks-

while on the way to pick up their retirement com-
pensation. '

And we ourselves‘? We cannot have too much
hope either. If we roar forth into war, chances are
we’ll be plowed under in some obscure cabbage
patch far from the sounds of glory and the tinkling
of Congressional Medals of Honor.

Even if we ‘die in bed, it will probably be of
pneumonia contracted while building a sewer.

Leave glorious and dignified death to thegpoets.
The best that we can hope for is to die decently
and quietly, without terror and without pain, and

Too Many Cars!

By Richard E. Rcluh

We have too many cars.

It seems to me that in this realistic, cruel world
we live in, that nasty transportation. problem de-
serves a careful look.
too much time talking about
war. We should be talking about
transportation.

Taking some of the more sal-
ient and innocuous facts, it is
clear that more cars equal more
r o a d s, w h i c h, interestingly
enough, equal more cars. Space
becomes a premium. I

The other day, when my I
brain apparently was beginning
to malfunction along these lines,
I conceived of a wonderful idea
to eliminate the mass transportation problem in
Pittsburgh: Plant grass over all city streets. This
brilliant thought occurred to me because of my
deep concern for the people of our fair city, and
for the thousands of motorists who drive to work
or to school and who face the traﬁic jams on the
way ‘home.

Without streets, of course, that car of yours
would be as obsolete as a membership card in a

Theda Bara, fan club. But then you might. say,
well, you dopey idiot (redundancy will get you no-
where), there are enough trees, grass, and flowers
without making all of Oakland and Squirrel Hill a
big meadow. Well, I would say, you obviously have
no appreciation for nature.

This clever bit of argumentation usually shuts
up people and makes them think more about mass
transportation. After all, why not have one gigan-
tic meadow? And who needs a car in the first
place? ‘

Recent Research

My recent research on these problems indicates
that, actually. it would be impossible to seed every
street. There isn’t enough seed, and eventually,
without it, Pittsburgh would look like a golden
sandbox. Also, I. began to realize that everyone
would have to walk, or use‘ a pogo stick, or even
buy 8 38910 to travel theograssy slopes. This would

VVe’ve been spending much"

 

never do. The grass plan must be shelved. But the
car still has to go.

I can see you are ready to pounce upon that last
statement. You will say: How dare you get rid of
a vehicle that has transformed our living habits?
But let me remind you that all the gas stations and
roads are created for cars. If I had my way, every-
one would be assigned automatic roller skates to
D1'013el him around. Most people think that this
solution indicates that I’m a simpleton, who should
be assigned light work on a farm.

It is inconceivable to me how people, can put
up Willingly With snake—like lines of traffic every-
day- Most motorists seek out new parkways as if
they were panaceas for getting home quickly. 'l‘he
Squirrel Hill Tunnel, for instance, certainly gives
the motorist something to think about

To Address Assembly

Dr. Rulon VV. Rawson will
deliver the 16th annual R. R.
Huggins Memorial Lecture at:
5 pm. November 9, in the
Scaife Hall Auditorium.

Dr.

(iocrinologist, is chief of the Divi-
sion of Clinical Investigation at
Sloan—Kettering Institute in New
York City, and a professor of
medicine at Cornell University
Medical College.

His topic for the lecture is "The
Relationships between ‘Chemical
Structure and Physiology Effects
of Thyroid Hormones: Clinical Ap-
plications.”

Dr. Rawson, a native of Idaho,
obtained his MD. degree from
Northwestern University. Before
joining the Sloan—Kettering Insti-
tute in 1947, he served for nearly
ten years on the teaching and re-
search staffs at Harvard Medical]
School. V ‘

Sponsored by Phi Delta Epsilon
medical fraternity, the lecture is
held in honor of Dr. R. R. Hug-
gins, dean of the University’s
School of’ Medicine from i919 to
1938.

noon speech Dr. Cleland heard
about Rubin from newspaper
reporters who had been called
anonymously.

When the members of the club
entered the meeting room, they
found mimeographed sheets re-
printing Senate testimony which
identiﬁed Rubin as a Communist
youth group director.

Cleland believes tl'at the liter-
ature could have been distributed
by members of the campus Con-
servative Studies Group, some of
whom attended the meeting.

Never Saw Paper

Two unidentiﬁed men, armed
with, printed records of Senate
testimony, first questioned Rubin
about his Communist afiiliations.

Not. only were Clel-and andv
the club members in the dark
about Rubin's background, but
neither had they seen a copy of
his newspaper, “l\'ew Horizons
for Youth.”

An editorial in New Horizons
warns that “the monopolists in
our country are pressing for ever
greater war preparations . . . feel-
ing that their interests would best
be served by fascism . . . In such
an atmosphere, and with the
buildup of the West German war
machine, we cannot with r-lear
conscience criticize the resumption
of nuclear testing by the Soviet
Union.”

Dr. Cleland explained that the
Inquiry Club is not angered be-
cause of the possible Communist
affiliations of Rubin snd his paper,
but that they “deeply resent be-
ing tricked into presenting a
speaker who deliberately misrep-
resented himself and concealed
his background.”

 The International Relations

Organization of

tions.

The group considered a hypo-

landowners in Venezuela. By the
end of the meeting, Venezuela
had fallen to the rebels. The re-
presentatives adjourned after they
formed a fact-ﬁnding committee
to g-o to Venezuela.

Drs. Carl Beck and R. W. Cot-—
tam from the political science de-

According to Cottam, the asmo-

“It Goes On..."

“CLARK BAR” .

A skinny, little, unassuming fella with thedistinguished moniker
of Edwin Milligan Clark, Jr. looks like he’d be a good student in, a
biology lab. First impressions are deceiving, however, as this Pitt
student happens to be the best offensive threat in the Panther
backfield.

Clark looks like he couldn't even kill time, but he has been
deadly to a lot of bewildered Pitt foes in the six games in which he has
performed so far. He has picked up 98 yards on 32 carries, and has
thrown four passes for 87 more yards in only four tries. ’ I

' His deftness with his right arm, isn’t a chance gift. He was a

oak from the bench throughout most of the season, seeing a sparse

20 minutes of action out of 600. ‘

Padded Weight _ ,

H “I was happy to change positions,” Clark said.
“I didn’t care where I played as long as I got in
_ the game.” Still, in pre-season appraisals Clark was
almost forgotten by the coaches, who were skeptical
because of his lightness. He’s only 5 ft. 11 in. tall,
and the brochure lists him at 170, but I think it's
padding a bit. I I

“But I thought that I was going to play,”

I he said. Now he’s running number one half-
back, and he likes the job. When Bob Clemens was hurt,‘ Clark I
fell “heir to the job. Clemens is ready to play now, but -that
doesn't meanvhe gets his job back.

“I’m glad he’s come back,” Clark remarked. It’s for the good
of, the team.” Does Clemens have to work to get his position again?
‘fl-Ie better, heck yeh!" Clark stated. ‘

Clarks father is a judge on the Indiana County court, a gradu-
ate of Muskingham College,‘a former law student at both Michigan
and Duquesne Universities, and an ardent Pitt fan. He» and his wife
come to all the “home games. When Ed scored a touchdown against
Navy, his mother was quoted as yelling, “I can’t help it, that's my
boy, and I’ve got to tell somebody about it."

Mum Doesn'-I- Like Press ,

“She probably won't like that,” Clark sighed. “My mum doesn't
like newspaperrnen. ’Cause she doesn’t like them doing things like
this —— writing stories about one man. She says they should write
about the team.” A

The team, which Mrs. Clark boosts, gives Clark quite a bit
of kidding about his slight frame. “When we went out to Cali-
fornia to play UCLA,” Clark disclosed, “they told me I couldn’t
play because the grass was too deep.”

“Clark Bar,” aslhis mates address him, didn’t get in the Syra-
cuse game last year. “They told me I was going to play. I was sup-
posed to play!" Backﬁeld Coach Carl DePasqua smiled, “He'll play

Syracuse Orange
Out For Revenge

By BOB SMIZIK

Enemy X-ray  

Sports W riter

If the Panther defense can continue the amazing success
they have had in containing Syracuses’ outstanding running
threat this Saturday as they have done in the past, the Cats
may have win number three in the hopper.

Jimmy Brown, at Syracuse man, who is currently break-
ing all the rushing records in the National Football League,
never had a good day against Pitt in the "three years he per-
formed for theOrang_e. Ernie Davis was 'Syracuse’s next
All-American back. and it appeared as though he broke the

jinx when he ran roughshod overé

the Panther line as Syracuse went
on to the National Championship,
in 1959.

'l‘he jinx came back to haunt
Davis last year when he was held
to a meager 37 yards rushing 
the Panthers pulled the upset of
the year by beating the Orange
and snapping the longest consecu-
tive winning streak in the nation.

Sarette Stars

Penn State stopped Davis two
weeks ago and beat Syracuse.
However. the Orange were play-
ing without the services of» quar-
terback Dave Sarette. Against
Holy Cross last week Sarette
proved that he can be the differ-
ence as he led his team to a 34-6
conquest. of Holy Cross. -

Converted quarterback Dick
Easterly will ﬁll in for injured
regular Pete Grokaw at the
other halfback slot. The inser-
tion of Easterly into the lineup
gives Syracuse the added threat
of 2. halfback who can throw.
In his two years of quarterback-
ing Easterly completed 53.6 per-
cent of his passes for 11 touch-
downs.

Coach John Michelosen will
have to rearrange his defense to
meet the Oranges unbalanced

line, an oddity in modern foot-
ball.

Spe-arheading the line will be
230 pound tackle John Brown.
who is considered by many to be

the ﬁnest tackle in Syracuse his-

tory. Brown plays theyoutside
tackle position and has the speed
to pull out and lead the block-
ing. He has run the 100 yard dash
in 10.8 seconds.

In addition to Brown there are
ten other lettermen on the line
to give the forward wail plenty
of experience. ,

Depth could hurt the Orange
backﬁeld. Bob Lelli, who has been

reinjured his hip against Howard
last Saturday but will play against
West Chester. Waite is not so
sure about Sichel.

So far this season West Ches-
ter has defeated Penn State-4-1
and has 2-1 victories over Duke
and North Carolina State.

Last year Pitt tied West Ches-
ter 1-1 to spoil their regularAsea-i-
son record. They were defeated
in the NCAA semi-finals by St.
Louis, the eventual champion.
Their overall mark last year was
11-1-1. g V

Panther wrestling coach., Rex Peery, has his wrestlers
out on the mats, “rasslin’ ” for positions on the 1962 winter

Most coaches would gloat over
such a report card, but the strict
disciplinarian who coaches the
Cats isn‘t overwhelmed by the rec-
ord. “It wasn’t a good season,” he
claimed. “We should’ve’won the

other three meets, too. This year
I told my kids we can go all the
way.” -

This discontent with mediocrity
or even moderate success is the
quality that has marked Peery as

one of the most successful _coaches
on the Pitt scene.

His team will golthrough gruel-
ing workouts for some time now,
all pointing towards a starting
berth for the opener. Each wrestler
knows that Peery wants a winner
and it rubs off. Sometimes on the

Magazine Sets
Filrn Showings

“Shane" will appear at the
Strand Theater next Tuesday...
Wednesday, and Thursday, as a
fund raising effort for “Ideas and
Figures,” the campus literary
magazine.

“One of the most classic of all
Westerns,” Susanna Downie, edi-
tor of the magazine, said,

“‘Shane' embodies all the trailsi

of the strong but unselfish out-
law. This theme runs back to the
Crettir Saga of old Norse liter-
ature."

According to Dr. Alan Mark-
man of the English department,
“the strongman outlaw is the last
Vestige of an heroic age. Men
who tame the frontier are always
heroes, and Shane is one of the
greatest of these because he
knows when his job is done and
moves on.” A

Tickets for the I and F showing
may be obtained at any Student
Desk.

playing dominoes and smoking Luckies. College students smoke Luckies all the
