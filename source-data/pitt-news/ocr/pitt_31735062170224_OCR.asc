A-‘lazy summer? Not by any
normal yardstick. Things have
been happening here at the Univ-
versity. Change is happening ——
some of it slow, maybe too slow,
but there’s a whisper of a prom-
ise. Rallies, meetings and discus-
sions, to air grievances and pos-
siblesolutions all began this sum-
mer, and hopefully, will continue.

To Everything There Is A Season

(Cmitiwiivrl from Page 1)

Some of the most important
changes met approval in meet-
ings. A June 26 meeting of the
Faculty of Arts and Sciences Coun-
cil approved the Black Studies
courses for the fall. and urged
“the University to provide imme-
diately the budget sum called for
on page 58 of the unbound copy of
the Black Paper for Black
Studies.” The two authors of the
Black Paper are Dr. Jack Daniel
of the speech department and Cur-
tiss Porter of the Black Action
Society. Discussion is ongoing for
a School of Black Studies, also
proposed in the Paper.

At a previous Faculty ‘Council
meeting June 17, the members
voted to support the “tutorial”
program to begin this fall with
some 80,000 from the Faculty Sen-
ate’s instructional budget, if nec-
essary. “Tutorial” students area
group of black students selected
for admission by a special admis-

Curtiss Porter, one of the authors
of “Black Paper for Black Studies”

sions committee and who will need
some additional services as Uni-
versity students. The program is,
in part, a response to the Univer-
sity statement concerning “social
justice programs.”

Other programs resulting from
that statement are:

—The Tri-M Scholar Program:
50 students entering their second
year this fall and 50 who began
this summer. They were admitted
on factors inthe area of “person-
ality. functioning. group feeling —
how the student identifies with
black people and positive feelings
toward himself." according to Dr.
Edward Barnes, assistant direc-
tor of the University Community
Educational Programs (UCEP ).

—The New Careers Program:
about 75 students, career social
workers who are older than most
college students.

—Head Start: approximately
75 students, taking courses. possi-
bly working for degrees in the
CAS. Presently, it is uncertain
when they will begin.

The Undergraduate Council (C),
as well as the Faculty Council
held meetings effecting academic
life. The Council appointed a
chairman and committee to the
Arts and Sciences Review Com-
mittee to survey the undergrad-
uate curriculum and related mat-
ters. Dr. David Bramhall was ap-
pointed chairman. The other mem-
bers are Professor David Hous-
ton, Professor Orlando Taylor,
Professor Xarrett Manel, Profes-
sor John Townsend, and Profes-
sor William Loerke. The UC will
consider the committee’s recom-
mendations and if approving
them, pass them on to the faculty
for full approval. >

With the abolition of the physi-
cal education requirement, only
120 credits are now needed for
graduation. The UC also author-
ized Dean Schneewind to set up
experimental courses under the
CAS. These courses would be giv-
en for one or two years, if no de-
partment would be willing to pick
them up. The first course to be-
gin under this program is CAS-1,
Sex and Sexuality.

The Council noted that the re-
striction placed on the use of
graduate courses for undergrad-
uate credit, limiting the number
to two. Now there is no limit on
the number that undergraduate
students may use, provided that
their enrollment meets the ap-
proval of their advisor and of the
instructor giving the course. Stu-
dents may now also take double
majors for credit on their degrees.

Proiect Thoght discussions followed the summer theme as they rseach-

ed “Channels for Change.”

The Council also approved a
regulation entitling students who
have already received their
bachelor’s degree to continue tak-
ing undergraduate courses for one
or two terms. At the same meet-
ing, Council members a-greed that
a separate review board be set up
to examine dishonesty cases.

Not only changes for students,
but also changes for the adminis-
tration occured. Associate Chan-
cellor for Student Affairs Jack
Critchfield resigned to take a post
on the North Caroline Board of
Higher Education, and was re
placed by Bernard Kobosky, for-
merly admissions director. Fréd
Robie was appointed acting direc-
tor of admissions. (See page one.)
John Vrana, formerly director of
student affairs planning, moved
to the position of director of Uni-
versity housing. Meanwhile, David
Ginevan, previous housing direc-
tor, and William Markus, assis-
tant dean of student affairs, re-
signed to form a business partner-
ship. Miss Lorraine Sibbit, asso-
ciate director of housing, also re-
signed.

New appointments included Dr.
Edward Barnes from UCEP to
associate dean (continuing his as-
sociation with UCEP) and Chenits
Pettigrew to assistant dean of
students. Donald N. Medearis,
Jr., M.D., will replace Dr. Fran-
cis S. Cheever as dean of the
School of Medicine Sept. 1.

The Board of Trustees was not
excluded from this administrative
face-lifting. Elected alumni trus-
tees were Robert G. MacDonald,
John M. Arthur, and Arthur J.
Brosius. .

Freshman Orientation was held
—but not as usual. This time, dis-
satisfaction with the regular pro-
gram led to a “disorientation”

“March for Peace and Justice” — a summer highlight.

and a slightly revised program,
with freshmen and upperclass-
men discussing topics relevant to
the University.

Dissatisfaction with society pro-
duced the numerous rallies and
demonstrations. A May Day rally
on the Cathedral lawn, sponsored
by Students for a Democratic So-
ciety (SDS), stressed the bond
that the speakers hoped would de-
velop between students,’ workers,
and minority groups. A March for
Peace and Justice May 24 fea-
tured Rennie Davis from the Na-
tional Mobilization to End the
War in Vietnam. The participants,
some 3,000, wove their way
through Pittsburgh streets to
Point State Park.

While there, the audience heard
Scott Baum, SG president read a
war opposition statement that had
been presented to the Duquesne
Club in downtown Pittsburgh that
Friday. At the Duquesne demons-
tration, 10 members of the Uni-

versity community had been ar- ‘

rested.

SDS made the news again when
the University chapter voted to
dissociate from the national or-
ganization.

A boost to “student power” was
the establishment of a Book Cen-
ter Coop. Under the new setup,
profits at the end of the year will

be paid as dividends according to
the individual’s purchase. Stu-
dents were also included in the ad

hoc committee to examine alter-"

natives to the ROTC program in
the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.
The committee, chaired by Pro-

fessors Richard Cottam and Jo-,

seph Zasloff, will report its rec-
ommendations to the faculty.
‘ I
For entertainment, the Univer-
sity.Theatre provided Little Mal-

colm and His Struggle Against $111} ,

Eunichs, which drew good—sized
crowds and favorable comment.

Speakers like Al Rojas from the
Grape Boycott and Senator Strom
Thurmond presented varying
viewpoints of society and govern-
ment.

The campus had its share of un-
constructive excitement as well
when a homemade pipe bomb ex-
ploded in a Tower B dorm room.
Another harrowing incident oc-
cured when three University stu-
dents were assaulted by a gang of
“high school kids.” V ‘  _

But the University involved .it-
self in quite a different way with
high school,” "something like
Pitt’s Free University.

After all, there’s no reason why 

the University has to be the only

place to change. - A ‘

—by DORN

The “Counter-Orientation” produced some
gram, along with its own innovations.

At orientation, freshman gathered to discuss pressing University issues.

 .' _DearDave:

 

  

July 31, 1969

The excellent questions about a tuition increase raised by Ken Schueler Diane Uly-

be . on, Vic Willen and you in our recent discussion with the Chancellor prompt this note.

In general terms, very sharp increases in the cost of the services and goods which
are the ingredients of a high quality educational program dictate increases in the price
paid by students.

These cost increases pose very special problems for Pitt in particular and col-
leges and universities in general. They must be paid if essentail resources are to be

  secured, but universities labor under an enduring disadvantage in competing for the
 q resources. In other parts of the economy (e.g., industry and agriculture) increases in

per. capita productivity provide a basis for non-inflationary increases in wages and sal-
aries. In colleges and universities, on the other hand, “productivity” (measured in
terms of output of student credit hours per professor, a measure which, of course, ig-
nores very important qualitative aspects of professional performance) is fixed by vir-
tually static professor-student ratios. In fact, the emergence of new and demanding

 fields ‘of inquiry, which call for higher professor-student ratios, tend on balance to re-
'3-',Vduce “productivity” in the educational world. As a result of this “cost squeeze,” for
5 at least 70 years, college and university costs have increased approximately four
 times as rapidly as costs in business and industry.

While it may be argued that state-relatedness was supposed to take care of this

 - problem, the fact is that increases in enrollment and the effects of the “cost squeeze”
 ‘have combined to produce a set of “requirements” which the State, given other de-

mands for resources, is unable to satisfy. It is true, of course, that in earlier years the
State moved slowly in providing strong support for higher education, but we‘ cannot

 ignore the 324 per cent increase in State appropriations to institutions of higher ed-
. ' ucation or the very substantial increases in State appropriations for new buildings and
.1. ,_ student aid in the last five years. With specific reference to Pitt, if state-relatedness

is judged in terms of its success in providing low cost, high quality educational oppor-

. tunities to residents, the $275 per term paid last year and the prospective $335 per
“term suggest that state-relatedness merits high marks.

Evidence which supports this assertion and bears on your questions about the
treatment of students from other states is found in our educational costs. These edu-

’ . cational costs, which include related indirect costs but exclude the cost of organized
' research and auxiliary enterprises, will amount to $2,500 per student in the current

fiscal year. The addition of other indirect costs- (e.g., the office of the Chancellor.
Comptroller, Office of Planning, etc.) boosts this to $2,670. Thus, residents of Penn-

" sylvania attending three terms will pay $1,005 ($335 times three) or approximately

38 per cent of average cost. The typical student who attends two terms will, oficourse,

 ‘V pay a smaller portion of average cost.

It is "true that the increase in tuition was prompted primarily by the anticipated

1 action of the Legislature. It follows, as you have pointed out, that it would be illogical

to hold non-resident students responsible for this in-state development. Three consi-

 derations suggest to me that this has not occurred and that the out-of-state students
I ‘L are being treated in an equitable manner. First, as noted above, the increased tuition
‘ paid by the non-resident student will be less than cost. Second, tuition paid by in-state

students is being increased 30 per cent, as (compared with a 10 per cent increase for
non-residents. (The corresponding percentages for part-time students are 50 and 16.)
Last, as in the past, a more-than-proportionate. share of the University’s student aid
funds will be awarded to non-residents.

I agree that student should control both the amount and allocation of student ac- ,

tivity funds. “Burying” a fee in tuition, the practice followed in the past, in undesir-

T . able for several reasons. It denies studentsa voice in determining who is to be “tax-

ed” and the amount of the fee. In short, students should determine who is to pay a fee,
how .much the fee is to be; the University's role should be restricted to that of a trus-

 j tee. While we are forced to impose a charge of $6 for the fall term for all full-time un-

' dergraduate students in order to cover already committed costs, this is an expedient
,3} '_ which the students themselves, graduate and undergraduate, should correct in the fall
’ '1 , term by deciding how this matter is to be handled in the future.

Sincerely.
Daniel B. Rathbun
Director of Planning

 

- good bye   -

First, good by confrontation politics. The Chancellor called the students into his

 [office for the meeting about which Dr; Rathbun spoke in his letter. He wanted us to

know the problems behind the tuition raise. He wanted ouropinion on the activities
fees. He wanted to know about the financial situation of student activities such as the
Pitt News.

To my mind, this means good by communications gap. The Chancellor suggested
that weekly meetings in the fall would bring the students and the administration closer
together. I agree.

This could lead to a good by to name-calling, petty politics, mistrust, and the dark
clou,tl,,of hate that hovered over this campus last year, causing many to seek shelter
welflﬁjefore the storm hit. “

 this optimistic outlook results from a lot of other good by‘s this summer.
The College said good by to the Phys Ed requirement, four extra credits. and many
other academic restrictions. It said hello to a Black Studies program and a number of
new courses. -

This summer I’ll have to say good by to Lois, Fred and Ed. breaking all my ties
with Oakmont, Pa».

«Last week I said good by to my six ‘year committment to Uncle Sam. Doesn't seem"
like six years ago I was going throughbasic training the Texas heat.

So, after a short vacation I’ll be sitting here writing a hello column in September.
But, I just hope my optimism prevails, and we can continue to progress until the big

Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.

Boy, I hate goodbyes. Don’t you? I hate
them because they somehow always mean
. well . . . goodbye forever. Goodbye
never means hello; goodbye is stronger
and remembered longer. And goodbye al-
ways means the end, or at least the begin-
ning of the end-. —

However, I believe the end is rather
personal ideal with goodbyes and endings
sometimes going hand in hand: a dead end
road, a locked door, an empty roll of toilet
paper, a sudden click at the other end of
the telephone, a refrigerator only filled
with ice cubes, a red light flashing in
front of your car, an all-night cram ses-
sion . . .

‘ YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

Elizabeth Asquith Bibescon, in “The
Fir and the Palm,” didn’t enjoy goodbyes
either. “It is never any good dwelling on
goodbyes. It is not the being together that
it prolongs, it is the parting,” she wrote.

Sen. Edward Kennedy said goodbye re-
cently. I won’t run for President of the
United Statesin 1972 hegsaid in essence.
That goodbye meant he cares an awful lot
about today’s society—the way persons
_“think” is what I mean. He said goodbye,
and I hate goodbyes.

Summer
promise to see each other in the fall. For a
week, but that’s all.

Henry Wadsworth Longfellow saw- it
thusly:

“Ships that pass in the night, and
speak each other in passing,

Only a signal shown and a distant
voice in the darkness;

So on the ocean of life we pass and
and speak one another,

Only a look and a voice; then dark-
ness again and a silence.”

GOODBYES ARE ‘EVERYWHERE:
they are the signatures on checks which go
to . . . the landlord, the gas company, the
electric company, the telephone company,
the booléof-the-month club, the record-of-
the-month club, the Pitt comptroller, the
wedding photographer, the hospital doctor,
and.‘-‘the funeral parlor director.

We cannot rid ourselves of goodbyes.
Everytime we leave secure surroundings,‘
we say goodbye.

“Thatlfamilar indefinable lump in the
chest,” wrote Anne Morrow Lmdberg 1n ’

“Listen! The Wind,” “. . . the going-away
lump, that had beenthere when I was a

child and was as uncontrollable now as
then. Leaving the seaside after the sum-
mer was'over . . . leaving houses . . . any
place that you had made with difficulty
and affection your home. In fact, simply
going away.”

It is better to leave and say goodbye
than it is to stay and say goodbye. Parting
is never sweet sorrow. _ ,

“There’s something in the'parting

hour '

Which will chill the warmest heart,

Yet kindred, comrades, lovers,

friends

Are fated all to part . . .

The one who goes is happier

Than those he leaves behind.”

' —Edward Pollock
The Parting Hour

I HATE GOODBYES. Don’t you? What
good comes from them? You might say a
goodbye is like a pause, a refresher from
the same day-in, day-out thing. But no.

A goodbye doesn’t really ruin anything.
It‘doesn’t help anything, either, unless we
speak of the ultimate in goodbyes—death.

“Every parting gives a foretaste of
death; every coming together again afore-

taste of the -resurrection.”,w£ote_Arthurg

lovers say goodbyes, and‘

good by

Schopenhauer in his “Psychological Obser-
vations.”

Death fulfills its obligation to us, but
what of it. Only the person who dies knows
what it means. I hate goodbyes, but I guess
that’s where this mess began. And so with
help from Eugene Field, I leave you with

this single thought:
“I’m sure no human heart goes

wrong
That’s told ‘Good-by—God bless
you!”

Health Service

Editor, The Pitt News,

I read.the moving account of
Mr. Hobart Harris’s attempt to
get medical care for his painfully
injured leg. He brings intofocus
a number of difficulties encoun-
tered in getting medical care at
the Student Health Center. I
should-like to comment on a few
of these.

1) Medical care is provided for
all dormitory students, all full-
time students and students in cer-
tain special programs, i.e. Up-
ward Bound. Faculty, employees
and part-time students are not pre-
sently covered, because this would
easily double or triple the number
of people who would require
medical attention.

2) Injuries are not treated be-
cause, as Mr. Hobart points out,'
better facilities are ‘nearby. The
cost of equipping Student Health’
with x-ray, lab and the services of
specialists would be prohibitive.
We have tried to provide these ser-
vices for the students by an in-
surance plan which will cover the

' cost of treatment of injuries. The

\-J?’

insurance, is valid only if the pa-
tient presents him or her self at a
hospital emergency room within
24 hours of the injury. If the in-
jury is treated by another physi-
cian or if the 24 hour time limit
has expiredfthe insurance does not
cover the cost of treatment. This-
sending of the patient to the em-
ergency, room has been misinter-
preted by some as a lack of con-
cern or interest on the part of Stu-
dent Health, when really the op-

posite is true.

3) Many wives, faculty, gradu-
ate assistants, students in town but
not attending the’ summer ses-
sion,‘ and students who have gradu-
ated have received “unofficial”
care at the Student Health Ser-

~ vice (somewhat to the consterna-

tion of insurance companies.)

4) Mr. Harris has a very legi- .

tima.te point that medical care is
extremely expensive. He sug-
gests that . . . . “increased ser-
vice would cost the University lit-
tle or nothingiat all. The care
could be provided by personnel and
facilities of the medical school

‘and teaching hospital.” The con-

cept of free or low-cost medical
‘care isa myth. .It, has to be paid
for by the government, univer-'

_ sity or private resourses. Even
when medical students and resi-

dents are used to provide service
as part of their medical train-
ing, cost ‘analysis shows that with
the cost of medical education de-
ducted from the total cost, ser-
vices run about the same as pre-
paid private care.

  

  
 
  
  
 
 
  
  

5) University Police have been
verylhelpful in providing transpor-
tation to injured students.

6) The Student Health Service
exists for the benefit of the stu-
dents of the University. The care
provided is first-rate in quality for
those students it covers. Unfor-
tunately, we cannot cover part-
time students, faculty, employees
or spouses unless we greatly ex-
pand our existing facilities. The
University is under tremendous
financial pressure, and an in-
crease in medical services is un-
der tremendous financial pres-
sure, and an increase in medi-
cal services would be very, ex-
pensive. Decisions have to be
made whether to put moneyvinto
new programs (such as Black

‘ Studies and Human Sexuality) or

whether to expand‘ existing ser-
vices. There is no easy solu-
tion. I will be quite willing to
discuss the extension of medical
services with any individual or
group in the hope we can pro-
vide more service to more people.
Sincerely
Joseph G. Hinchliffe, M.D.'

As your readers may already
know, three black teenagers from
Pittsburgh’s Hill District have
been sentenced to die in the elec-

in Harrisburg.

Dear Dr. Posvar:

We, the Pitt chapter of Students
for a Democratic Society, are

‘calling to your attention the case

of Wiggins, Tarver, and Bar-
low. These three black teenagers
have been sentenced to death,

. having been convicted for a mur-

der during a bank robbery. As a
director of the Western Pennsyl-
vania American Civil Liberties Un-
ion you are aware — we are sure
— of the unjust and barbarous na-

ture of capital punishment in-

Dear Mr. Bauman:

I am greatly disturbed by the
sentences imposed upon the three

young defendants in the Harris—~

burg bank robbery case.

The position of the ACLU
chapter has been made public
andvhas my complete support. I
am opposed to the death penalty
and find it particularly abhorrent

if applied in a discriminatory

fashion. It is my hope that there '

will be a reduction in the sen-
tence in this case either as a re-

sult of appropriate judicial pro-

ceedings or action by the Gover-
nor. V

Thank you for writing me to
express your concern.

Sincerely yours, ~

to participate in later months. the
statement says.

A central office in Washington
is coordinating plans for the dem-
onstrations and projects to take
place on the moratorium days.
Among the committee’s suggest-
ed actions for the first demonstra-
tion and boycott day are town
meetings, debates, rallies, leaflet
distribution, study groups, vigils
in homes and churches, anti-war
films, petitions, teach-ins, and me-
morial services for war dead.

The committee refuses to re-
fer to its class boycotts as strikes,
because it does not feel the indus-
trial analogy applies.

The monthly protests are to
continue “until a negotiated set-
tlement is signed . . . or a definite
timetable for bringing all Ameri-
can'troops home from Vietnam is

made,” the committee has an-_‘

nounced.

I   iy Opposes

University Expansion

(Co-/I/iz1.'u*rl from Page I)

This was the second public
hearing in which Schenley Farms.
residents have objected .to the
University's plans. The Univer-
sity is now asking that the Com-
mission hold its recommenda-
tion to City Council until the Uni-
versity can submit a third pro-
posal.

The residents’ complaints have
centered around the Universityls
constructed 200 feet from the
Schenley Farms‘ residential area.
The residents aired further griev-
ances about the following:

-Greater efforts should be made
to include the residents in Uni-
versity planning.

—The lack of adequate parking fa-

cilities. .
—The 14 story‘ structure. which

the residents preferred not to
- have to look at.

-A-An adjacent shelter area for
‘-students waiting for the cam-
pus bus which would encourage
“milling.” “

—-The rubbish that students dis-
card in the" Schenley Farms
area.‘ A i ’ '

—The poor maintainence of Uni-

versity-owned homes which are
rented to its personnel.

In the original plan the building
would have been ten feet from the
curb—only 160 feet from the res-
idential area. The Director of Phy-
sical Blants, Hunt Martin, ex-
plained why the building had only
been set back 20 feet in the re-
vised proposal, rather than 40
feet, and ‘why the tower had not
been redesigned.

To set the building back 40 feet
would necessitate cut-ting the au-
ditorium in half and would mean a
loss of classroom space. In addi-
tion, the delays created by these
changes would increase construc-
tion costs during each additional
month of delay. A

It would be impossible to rede-
sign the tower into a seven story
structure because of the soil cov-
er in that area. Any construction
beyond the proposed tower site
could be jeopardized by possible
land or mud slides.

Martin’ further described the-

transfer of "the loading dock from
Parkman Ave. to University
Drive. This change was in re-
sponse to an earlier criticism of
the residents.

Following the Commissions’
announcement of its negative rec-
ommendation, the University de-
cided to submit a third proposal
which will place the building. 200
rather than 180 feet from the res-
idential area. Parking space will
not be-increased in the immediate
area, and the tower will not be re-

designed. The University faces
increased construction costs over
these delays. This third proposal
was presented in the University
Times on July-9. g

The University was not requir-
ed to secure city approval for this
building since it is being financed

in part by the General State All-'.

thority. Residents are still deny-

ing that this legal stancecould‘

have circumvented City Council’s
approval. '

Reporter's Footnote:

Two side issues arose out of Fri-

 

day's hearing which beajriweight »

on the University's image to the

Pittsburgh community. 4
During the presentation by Hunt

Martin, Pete Flaherty, the indepen-

dent Democratic candidate for may-

or and member of the City Council,
said that early in July the Council
had been shown a plan which in-
cluded the 50 foot setback that: is
now part of the third proposal and
which was not represented in the
second one_. "

This reporter supported Flaherty’s-

comment on the basis of an article
appearing in the July 9' issue',of the
University Times which described
the 50'foot setback. This article was

printed printed after the Council-

meeting to which Flaherty referred.“

University officials proceeded to
define that plan as an intermediate

one which they rejectedonce the‘

increased costs involved “were ap-
parent. ' 

A telephone conversation’ with
Louis DiNardo, the city clerk, con-
firmed the University’s contention
that the meeting was an informal
one, and no plans 6: sketches had
been presented. ’

While later research clarified the
misunderstanding, the University
appeared in a shady light _at the
hearing._ ’  .
Secondly, the residents raised
some pertinent questions about"
their role in University planning. It
seems to me that to quibble over 20.7
feet when‘ there were‘ ‘other more
objectionable complaints which ei-
ther could not be feasibly comprom-
ised (the tower) or the University
chose not to_ compromise ( parking
facilities). ‘ I
As the meeting adjourned, one
felt that the residents had not re-.
ceived suitable responses to some
of their criticisms, because they had
entered the planning stage too late.
ln discussions outside the hearing
room, it was apparent that the Uni-

versity was interested in avoiding 

such controversy in thefuture.

The long-range nature of Univer-
sity planning has been an‘impedi-
ment to effective resident partici-
pation. Residents do not seem to be
aware of the impact of University

plans—even when these plans are ‘

revealed several years iriadvance
—until the plans are about to be

put into operation. At this,pain,t the, 3

University has made financial and
property commitments which lim-
it the alternatives available.

The University of Pittsburgh

should decide to establish more ‘ef- ‘

fective channels for consultations
with residents in long-range plans;
it is hoped that residents will have
the far-sightedness to respond. .

THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY
OF‘ THE COMMONWEALTH‘ OF
PENNSYLVANIA HEREBY EN-
ACTS AS FOLLOWS: -

Section’ 1. Annual scholarships
of free tuition or, in the case of
State ‘colleges or universities,
payment of the basic fee, are here-
by created for award to qualify-
ing students who are residents of
the Commonwealth, at State,
State-re_lated and State-aided col-
leges and universities.

Section 2. The scholarships
provided by this act shall be
awarded on the basis of not more
than one to eachi50 enrolled stu-

‘ dents, undergraduate or graduate,

who are residents of the Common-
wealth, and each of whom takes

an oath or affirmation to serve‘

the particular educational institu-
tion as a “Keeper of the Peace”
to assist in quelling campus dis-
turbances and to be on call for
such purpose 24 hours daily
during‘ the semester school year
with reasonable exception for
certain free weekends and holi-

. days to be made. The service is
the consideration for the scholar-

ship. The contracts shall be made

, by the executive head of the edu-

F;/‘gm

cational institution when approv-
ed by its board of trustees.

Section 3. Every such “Keep—
er of the Peace” shall when acting
in such capacity wear a badge, an
arm band or a uniform, stating in
the American language. in size
large enough to read “Peace Offi

I ' _ DAY CARE CENTER

-There are a number of wo-

men with small children study-
ing at the University who may
be finding babysitting a prob-
lem and a burdensome expense
and who might welcome the es-
tablishment of a day care cen-
ter. Information as to which, or
even how many. students have
children does not seem to be pool-
ed in any single office in the uni-

versity, if it is available at all,

and it would be difficult to make
an effective plea for facilities
without some demonstration that
such a center would actually be
found-‘useful by the students. We
would like to know, for instance,
how much of the day would have
to be covered and how cheap it
would have to be in order for mo-
thers to feel it worth the effort
of bringing their children into
Oakland. Would anyone who is in-

peaceful guardian of the orderly
processes and peaceful operation
of the educational institution, and
if necessary to maintain order, or
in the event of uprising, rioting,
vandalizing, or any act of violence
or destruction or interference in
the orderly and established prac-
tices of the educational institu-
tion, shall have the power to ar-

Section 4. Each educational in-

shall pay the scholarships herein
provided for in a total amount not
to exceed the payments'“of Com-
monwealth moneys or reimburse-
ments paid to it.

Section 5. This act shall take ef-
fect immediately.

In an interview with the Sunday
Patriot-News (June 15), Wade

, Camp Hill Republican and Senate

Appropriations chairman, empha-
sized that the proposed “Keepers
of the Peace’? would not be a
campus police force nor would
they be equipped with weapons.

Wade felt the bill to be a posi-

tive step since, “many students, ,

even those not involved in disrup-

tive demonstrations, .resent the’

calling in of police or National
Guard in‘situations they feel are a
“family fight” that could be set-
tled internally;

Wade further stated that “it is
our thinking that if representative
leaders of the -student body, such
as those involved in student gov-
ernment councils, “thought”
groups, and heads of various fra-
ternities, could be organized to
talk down troublesome situations
before they get out of hand, the
need for calling in police autho-

ities would be averted.”

Reporter's Footnote:

It appears that certain points
concerning the actual mechanics of

, the proposed scholarships must be

clarified, and an effort made to de-
termine whether designated “Keep-
ers of the Peace” would be able to
perform that function. ' E

In light of this, a number of ques-
tions may be asked:

I. Does such a scholarship ‘con-
tract presuppose that the entering
student is fully aware of: all uni-
versity regulations, all university
policy, the methodology of policy
decisions, and that he agrees to

and is willing to support all‘of the

tract?

2. Does such a scholarship vio-
late the recipient's. political affilia-
tion by not permitting him to make
or act on a decisioncontrary to that
of his administration or the state
legislature? ‘

3. Does such a scholarship violate
the basic purpose of the university
by freezing a student into a posi-
tion and preventing him from
changing that position without eco-
nomic duress?

4. Does such a scholarship violate
the basic purpose of state subsidiz-
ed financial assistance since it es-
tablishes a criterion other than
need?

“Our basic problem is to have
perspective students understand
what opportunities are available
here,” stated Robie. He is pres-
ently working on several pro-
grams which promise to do just
that.

His office is helping to work on
the tutorial transitional program.
He also is planning to set up im-
proved individual contacts "with
guidance counselors in out of state
high schools. The Alumni Secon-
dary Schools Program, working
with the Secondary Schools Com-

‘Pork’-Frustration, Murder

by VIRGINIA JOYCE
Staff News. Writer

There are many ways to relieve
‘sexual frustration, sublimation,
assault, masturbation. Miss Aus-
ten of That Cold Day in the Park
tried another way—murder.

The storyline of the movie
which has just completed a run at
the Manor Theatre in Squirrel
Hill reflects the mind of Miss Aus-
_ten, andupper-class spinster play-
ed by Sandy Denis.

She has been delegated by her

position to being the family’s en-
tertainer, meat carver and old
maid. But she is unhappy, and sick
of the lascivious and obvious ad-
vances of an oldfamily friend
who keeps trying to convince her
that “the friendship has reached

- a different stage now.”

The sexual frustration and re-
pression of the main character
‘ drove her completely out of her-
self. She grabbed at the apparent
helplessness of a young boy of
19, invitinghim to her home, serv-
ing him breakfast in bed, intend-
ing to lose her implied virginity
with his help.

And he played right into the
trap. He paraded in the semi-nude
around the flat. His constant si-

' lence mystified her. His sensual-

ity egged her on.

He helped to build his own pris-
on, a prison of bubble baths, lat-
tice windows and clean sheets.
But his

he escaped through the window to
return to his world of grass and
“hippies,” the more frustrated
and devious became his benefac-
tress.

Soon the window would not open.
And Miss Austen dragged him
into her world of fantasy.

Her actions became completey
out of character for her and she
performed them as if she were
walking through a dream.

She went to a birth control clin-
ic to have herself fitted with a dia-

phragm; she made the rounds of.

“ill-reputed” places to pick up a
prostitute for her war; she con-
sciously and methodically built
the trap. . '

backfired on him. The more often '

And then it sprung and her mind
sprung with it, taking the lives of
two others. '

That Cold Day in the Park is an
emotional experience, one that
does not lend itself easily ti dis-
section and analysis. It builds
very subtly, shocking the viewer
at the gut level, not in the mind.

For this reviewer, the movie

was more than a case study, it
was an experience._ .  _

does not serve a placement or re-

The Career Seminars were first
presented in February, 1969. This
year an effort has been made to
increase student involvement in
the program. All interested stu-

through campus organizations.
As a result, a student.steering

Focuses on Selection

by JUDY LE WANDOWSKI

The Career Seminars is a cooperative student-administrative ef-
fort to focus the relevance of educational preparation on career selec-
tion. The program is designed to bring the student into contact with a
wide range of educational and professional possibilities. Through infor-
mal conferences with career “exemplars," students gain information
about requirements for entry and success in areas of interest to them.

The seminars provide a personal vehicle for expanding the individ-

steering committee and their re- _

spective institutions.

The seminars will be presented
each Wednesday during the
month of October in the SU ball-
room. -
