Volume 63, No. 61

by VIRGINIA JOYCE .
Staff News Writer

More than 800 students crowded into a
smoke-filled Commons Room Friday at
noon to hear and challenge a representa-
tive of Senator Robert Fleming in his de-
fense of Bill 227 which passed the State
Senate last week.

Alan Disler. an editor of Alternative,
prefaced the proceedings by revealing that
it was Senator Fleming a few years ago
who proposed a resolution banning the sale
of Beatle records in Pennsylvania because
John Lennon had claimed that the Beatles
were more popular than Jesus Christ.

Joel Schlesinger. senior. acted as host
and introduced the main speaker. Martin
W. Shearer. legal assistant and research
analyst to Fleming. Shearer had come to
the University to speak in the Aspinwall
senator‘s place. '

“The University of Pittsburgh was not
mentioned in the drafting of the bill, not
particularly,” claimed the Pitt alumnus.

“It applies to all high schools, colleges and.

universitities in the Commonwealth.”

UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

As interpreted by Shearer. the bill is
designed to protect the students and their
freedoms of speech. expression and assem-
biy. Since an alleged violation of the Flem-
ing bill leads to a summary proceeding. a
process which is below the criminal court

level. it keeps students’ names from crim-

inal records unless the students in question
are found guilty of serious violations.

In speaking of the protection of freedom
of speech under the Fleming proposal.
Shearer averred that “the bill is intended to
protect freedom of speech and the other
freedoms from anyone or anything which

- would interfere with those freedoms."

“It is impossible for the bill to oppress
freedom of speech in a university, the place

where free expression should flow more

freely than in the world of business,” be-
lieved the speaker.

Shearer complained that the biggest
problem of the bill lies in its language.
“Although the language of the bill is weak
and vague. it speaks as specifically as it
can in terms of the general conduct of per-
sons." he said. .

Teach-In Draws 800

Dr. Jonathan Harris. political science.
took issue with the remarks of Shearer.
“The existing laws are already sufficient."
he claimed. “The ambiguity of the bill‘s
language can act as an intimidation against
students who are unclear as to what sort’ of
action is open to them."

As Harris was railing against the bill
as a threat to the University’s autonomy,
which he considered to be essential to the
functioning of a true university, student
groups behind him raised paper signs de-
noting their attitudes toward the bill. One
read, “Let’s learn to build, not destroy”;
another said, “Pass the bill!”

Wolf Swoboda. teaching fellow of the
History Department. supported Harris’
point of view. predicting "as long as bad
laws are made. there will be good people
to break them.“

He commented on “the conspicuous ab-
sence of Senator Fleming" and went on to
call for the resignation of Fleming from
the Board of Trustees of the University.

Iniresponse, Shearer termed Fleming
“one of the great men of the Common-
wealth,” and claimed that “to know him is

to respect him.” Shearer further defended -

his boss by citing that Fleming had sup-
ported the recent introduction of a resolu-
tion in the State Legislature to have a full
study of the existing problems in schools
of Pennsylvania. -

It is to be noted that throughout the en-
tire “Teach-In" petitions were being cir-

‘culated which calls for the resignation of

“It is just as bad to limit interaction 
with the Board, wllich is part of society, 

whether we like it or no,” he said.

Shearer was challenged several times’, -'-".3.
for a definition of “lewd and lascivious be-, 

havior" which is a provision of the Flem-

ing legislation. “I will not define lewd,” ‘ 
he said. “Do you want me to be arrested?” .: W

Lew Taffer. an editor of Alternatives, 'f“’f
rapped‘ Fleming and his nondefinition o-f‘ 
punishable conduct. “I'm sick of those jok.—-- , J5}

in the future to say to Robert Flemi'ng_._

In answer to the queries of a number . 
of students as to why the Fleming bill is 
aimed at schools rather than “any other 
segment of the population,” Shearer said . 
that “there is something special about as 

university.”

APOLOGY '

We apologize to the Pitt The-
atre for ‘printing the story,
“Pitt Theatre Rolls in Disor-
ganization” that appeared in
Friday’s edition. The story
amounted to a review of a stage
rehearsal. And the charge that
members of the Theatre were
responsible for exposing large
amounts of film was erroneous.
The film was destroyed in a
truck accident.

Beyond this. the author of
th'e piece broke confidence in
publishing the story. We are
sincerely sorry for any incon-
venience we may have caused.

from org  s recognized on
campus. “As long as the signs are
from a recognized organization,
I have to approve them,” JEH
said. “The reasoning behind this
is that if an organizations has met
the requirements for University
recogniztion, its publicity is al-
lowed to be circualted.”

“I've seen a lot of posters go
‘under the bridge.” he said. “and
in all my years there has been
only one set of signs I didn‘t
stamp. I felt that they just'were-
n't suitable for posting.“

People often wonder who
“JEH" is and if there is really
such a person. Many freshman
have the conception that he is a

ing away on the top floor of the
Cathedral stamping signs all day.

In reality Hedges has an office
at the Information Center on the
first floor of the Cathedral and is
far. from being a “small fragile
ancient man.” His duties as Uni-
versity Proctor also include su-
pervision of the rental of lockers
and the check room. Occasionally
he gets the opportunity to “make
students happy” by cancelling
classes. “The professor’s office
will call here and ask me to dis-
miss the class,” he said. “After I
make the announcement I have to
step back to avoid the stampede.”

"I'ts been a wonderful 20
years." he went on. "and it's been
a lot of fun. Tremendous people
pass through here. Some of those
I met years ago are now doctors.
lawyers. and teachers."

. -The demonstration held Friday in
the Commons Room was both unneces-
sary and counter- productive. If stu-
dentscontinue to mobilize before the
passage of the Fleming bill. repressive
legislation will certainly be shoved
down our throats. This newspaper is
ideologically repulsed by the Fleming
legislation, but we cannot condone acts
that will insure its_passage.

 The future life or death of the
/Fleming bill lies in student hands. and
we all should realize that a delicate
political game — a repugnant political
game—is being played.

E Much of the furor over the Flem-
iiig’ bill has been caused by the mis-
perception of the academic commun-
ity ‘-by the Harrisburg legislators. And '
every demonstration that receives press
play in the newspapers or on radio and
elevision serves like a spray of oxy-
gen fueling the fires of student hatred.
All of this, of course, aids Sen. Flem-
mg in his fight to stage a crackdown
on “student rebels.”

.»At this point. the Fleming bill has
passed that “august -body." the State
Senate, and is now quietly resting in
the desk of Speaker of the House Her-
bert Fineman (D.-Philadelphia). Rep.
Fineman is opposed to the Fleming
bill, and will. most likely. sit on the
bill for a number of weeks.

,. Eventually, however. Rep. Fine-
man will have to send the bill to the
chairman of the House Judiciary Com-
mittee. The Judiciary Committee
chairman can keep the Fleming bill in

his desk indefinitely. If tempers cool
down in Harrisburg (over a period of
time). the Fleming bill could die in
committee.

Beyond this, Gov. Raymond Shaf-'

er has reluctantly stated his opposition
to the bill. He places his faith in the
present laws in Pennsylvania concern-
ing disturbances.

The present situation in our view.
is somewhat less than pessimistic. The
House leadership is against the Flem-
ing bill. and even the Governor has ex-
pressed his opposition.

Arrangements are being made at
this time for students to meet and talk
to legislators in Harrisburg. A construc-
tive dialogue can only improve the
warped relationship between legisla-
tors and students at this crucial time.
It will. according to legislative sources.
enhance the possibility of the Houses
rejection of the Fleming bill. Students
from all of Pennsylvania's state-related
and state-operated universities will be
descending on Harrisburg in the near
future. And the outcome of these forth-
coming talks should be fruitful.

On the other hand, a student sit-in
or teach-in will give groups like the
American Legion and the Veterans of
Foreign Wars evidential ammunition
to speed up the legislative process that

y will insure the Fleming bill’s passage.

This newspaper. in short. is suggest-
ing that students here “cool-it“ for a
‘few_ weeks. Don't give the legislature
a chance to pass repressive legislation.

fl;-Disillusioned Commuter Raps Association

a group that is supposed l0 represent all
commuters. I was also surprised to discover
that the Commuter Association constitu-
tion contained discriminatory member-
ship practices. It provided that any new
members must be “passed upon" by-an Ex-
ecutive Board. The Executive Board is se-
lected by a Commuter Council. which is
chosen by the Executive Board. (Try to’
figure that one out! )

When we tried to correct some of the
constitutional deficiencies. LaPietra in-
formed us that there was no provision for
constitutional change. Finally. LaPietra.
officers. and other members walked out of
the meeting. refusing to confront the prob-
lems. _

What if the leadership of every repre-
sentative group on campus were to oppose
the will of the majority of its members‘?
How is the Commuter Association going
to get anything done if the leaders of the
group refuse to hear new ideas. new ways

of doing things. and refuses to admit new i

members who are obviously interested I’ ,

Honoraries are absurd.

Every term. on or around Tap Day. that
same statement rings out from various
quarters of the campus. Wednesday's Tap
Day will be no different—except that we
hope you heed our message.

The campus "leadership" honoraries.
particularly. are not only absurd. but they
fulfill no function and are discriminatory
in the darkest sense of that word. This is
not a new revelation: look ‘what the past
two editors have pointed out:

“ALL TOO ,OFTEN HONORARIES be-
come havens for a particular clique of peo-
ple. who strive to perpetuate their own
sense of yalues at the expense of.bettering
the honorary. Recognition is only an hon-
or when it is fairly distributed. It becomes
tainted when it serves to exclude those
who are deserving but have made enemies."

“Tappees eventually become a list of
rather neutral people who have offended
no one and have not made any contribu-
tion of depth to University leadership."

I am notwriting this out of bitterness
towards honoraries because of personal re-
jection. as people in the past have. I am a
member of Druids (although not for much
longer). and I was tapped for ODK last
fall. but rejected membership. I speak.
rather. from personal experience and the
experience of others.

_ Now. what function do the honoraries
serve‘? None. There is no need to recog-
nize a leader for his contribution to the
campus.

For one. any person making a meaning-
ful contribution gets enough self—satisfac-
tion from making it that he shouldn't need
an extra pat on the back. And secondly. if
a student is indeed making a meaningful
contribution. then he receives sufficient
notoriety and recognition from his peers.
There is no need to set up a separate elite.
Too frequently. -joining the elite replaces
success as a leader as an ultimate goal of
people entering into student activities.

OTHER REASONS offered for the per-
petuation of these honoraries include the
semi-frequent luncheons. these groups
have which "bring together student lead-
ers for a valuable exchange of ideas.“
Right. At the last two Druids luncheons
there were less than a dozen students at
each one. and the best attended luncheon
all year was "the one at which the football
coach spoke. H

Besides, isn't it possible for "student
leaders" to come together and exchange
ideas without the honorary mechanism?
Of course. They do it everyday.

Recently. an officer in one of the lion-
oraries defended the existence of his or-
ganization. and the only cogent argument
he could offer in its defense. besides the
luncheons (a shaky point. at that). was
that if offered him a good item to put
down on his graduate school application.

Is‘ that what an honorary is for? Grad
school applications’?

Perhaps it is better. though. not to phil-
osophize. but to giye some concrete ex-
amples and let you draw some generaliza-
tions from them:

—This year there was an attempt to liber-
alize the entrance requirements to Dru-
ids because some members felt that vari-
ous campus leaders were being excluded
because of low grades. .\ philosophical
debate raged as to whether grades de-
tcrminc leadership ability. Finally.
three-fourths of the members present de-
cided that grades do indeed determine
leadership and voted to keep the 2.50
QPA restriction. That automatically
meant that none of the Black leaders
that had been previously nominated
qualified for membership. among others.
One member‘ stood and said. “In effect.
you're saying there are no Black leaders
on campus." Another member ("student
leader“ remember» turned and answer-
ed. "\'one that qualify for Druids.“ (In
all honesty. let us add that one token
black was later deemed qualified for
membership. ~
There is a rule in Druids that allows for
two ballots at tap meetings—one on a
candidates objective qualifications. one

on his subjective qualifications. The ob-
ject of the former is to remove any can-
didate who clearly qualifies from any
subjective considerations or personal
opinions.. Thisshould reverse Druids
from cliquishness. On the first ballot.
however. only one of 31-candidates was
deemed objectively qualified. The rest
were then subjected to personal discus-
sion. This is absurd.

LOOK AT THE LISTS of tappees.
Wednesday. I‘m sure you‘ll find some im-
portant names missing. and you may be
surprised by other names. Know why? Be-
cause there are procedures and events as
previously described. There are times
when two people have the exact same
qualifications for being tapped. but one is
slighted because he doesn't have enough
fraternity brothers or friends already in
the honorary. There are also times when
people rationalize excuses for barring ad-
mission to candidates they personally dis-
like.

People may say. why not reform hon-
oraries. Forget it. They are doomed to con-
servative imbreeding. Honoraries will for-
ever be the domain of the "campus elites."

And so. I object to honoraries because
they are prejudicial. narrow-minded. and
unnecessary. They are dominated by
cliques who recognized hard-working (but
not necessarily leadership-type» friends
and ignore personal enemies regardless of
qualifications. Simply. honoraries are not
open to all types of student leaders on
campus.

It is for these reasons that I refused
membership in ODK last fall: and it is for
these reasons I now resign my membership
from Druids. The above-signed people also
resign their membership in Druids and or
ODK. ‘

Furthermore. we all hope" that you peo-
ple who are tapped Wednesday will think
twice about the "honor" you are receiving
and then reject it. At this point it seems
the moral thing to do.

Discipline Of What  Kind?

by ALLAN SENIO
Contributing Columnist

‘ The recently proposed Flem-
ing-Zord legislation coming on
top of the FBI informer revela-
tions. has caused much noise on
this campus. The academy is very
fearful about losing its money
and autonomy. I see in this whole
mess touches of the finest irony. '
One campus group which has
loudly opposed state or Federal
intervention in university a_ffairs
is the SDS-Hippy amalgam. They
are particularly troubled these
days not only about the Fleming-
Zord bill. but more specifically
over the presence of FBI agents
in their midst. One cannot. how-
ever. help but remember the glee
of these hersute eggheads some
years back. when that same FBI
was hounding_Lester Maddox out
of his restaurant business. What's
good for the redneck is going in-
evitably to be good for the Hip-
py. New Left types like a dicta-
torial central authority to stamp
on States rightists. segregation-
ists. and others who fall into their
disdain. They never once suspect-
ed that their friends in Washing-
ton would use the power of the
police state against them. At least
not until some of their own asso-
ciates turned out to be spying on
their hallucinogenic indiscre-
tions. So quickly flies the inno-

cence of youth! ! I hope the.re—=

cent events will bring a few hip-
pies out of the fog. Possibly they
can now see that a‘ government
with unlimited power to’ coerce

and enslave. will tend to use that
power on all of us. not just the
“bigoted Southerners." And. dear
New Lefters. no matter what they
tell you in Poll Sci class. no dic-
tatorship is benevolent.

THE ADMINISTRATION and.

faculty have of course responded
to the threats of our Harrassburg
law makers with squeels of anger
and fright. It has of course been
the appeasement policy of the top
brass at Pitt which has made such
action by the state necessary. At
ever.y confrontation the leaders of
our intellectual community have
bent over backwards to satisfy
violent and seditious outfits on
campus. lfthe administration en-
forced the rules and bounced out
students who resort to violence
the state legislature would have
no need to act.

State intervention and ultimate-
ly state control is the conse-
quence of state relatedness. He
"tho pays the fiddler calls the
tune. The state is paying and can
call any tune it wishes. The uni-
versity. having made itself de-
pendent on state aid. will have to
dance to their music. Some say
the law would be unenforceable‘.
loss of state aid would "enforce"
an immediate collapse of Pitt.
The big whigs at the top of the
Cathedral I assume dont want
that. They would go along with
the dictates of Harrassburg.

Close—Minded. Students

by TOM WALSH
Staff News Writer

Eleven forty-five on Friday.
Feb. 28. five minutes before the
“teach-in" in the Commons Room.
found me in my French II class.
where a fellow student asked.
"What is the Fleming Bill?""‘If
you use obscene language. as in-
terpreted by Mr. Fleming. or par-
ticipate in any demonstrations.
peaceful or otherwise. you can be
fined and put in jail." I replied.
The searching student blurted out
a narrow-minded. "Good. all
those hippy-radicals Xpeople who
attend the teach-ins and "have
longer hair than hev. should be
thrown out of school and into
jail." “Have you ever attended

‘ one of those teach-ins." I- asked.

' "No." he answered.

For a person as outspoken in

his condemnation of these stu-
dents in their search for truth. I
find him to be rather poorly in-
formed’: in fact. darned-right ig-
norant. Give a person like that a
college education.‘ a political
gathering.'and we will have an-“

other Senator Fleming.

Did Mr. Fleming take time out
from his senatorial duties to at-
tend our campus demonstrations
and teach-ins before he so blunt-
ly cast his vote in the form of a
crack-down-on-students bill? No.
‘he did not! '

AS A member of our Board of
Trustees. Mr. Fleming should cast
aside his legislative crutches and
show us. the students. that he

-- cares about us. You are indeed ‘in

a" difficult position Mr_. Fleming:
as a. senator you have to please the
poorly informed public. and as a

-Trustee you are expected to do

your best to try and aid the stu-
dents. It is my belief that if you
cannot please both groups at the

A same time. you should resign from

one of your two posts and work
harder in the other.

It has been said that the stu-
dents main job in college is to get
an education. I will agree with
that. But to me an education im-
plies more than high grades. it
implies an attempt to be totally
aware of current happenings.

 

Humphrey as allied with the vio-
lent elements in society. Nixon
and Wallace who polled 64 per
cent of the vote were seen to sym-
bolize resistance to the New Left
anarchy of the Johnson years. Po-
liticians are going to do what is
expedient. It has become fashion-
able these days to take a stand
against violence on campuses.
There is political hay to be made
and therein lies the indication

that Harrisburg will pass some '
sort of bill which will seek to reg- -

ulate university affairs.
IT IS unfortunate that the FBI

‘has spies on our campus. This. of

course. was the natural result of
University officialdom's reluc-
tance to, deal with the drug prob-

I lem. It is also too bad that our ad-

ministrators have allowed such a
mood of violence to develop

among extremist students. This,

administrative laxity invites state
intervention. When it becomes
evident that the university cannot
control itself. the outraged pub-
lic. through its representatives
feels obligated to impose order.
Big brother's stern hand is about
to be applied to the naughty lit-
tle boy.

The administration at this
school has some serious fence
mending to do. It had better get
moving or someone else is going
to do the job. Chaos is the inevit-
able predecessor of dictatorship.
A conscientious administration
could kick out the trouble-makers
and stop the chaos before it drags
us to its ultimately disastrous re-
sults.

Take Heed!

We can neither accept nor re‘-‘
ject legislation such as Fleming's
without first hearing both sides
of the issue. I charge Mr. Flem-
ing. that you are guilty of writ-
ing the bill without attempting to
understand the students views.
Now you are passing the ball of
understanding on to your consti-
tuents. As one student put it.
“That is pure laziness."

S0, FOR all you people. leg-
islators. students and general pub-
lic. I beg you. do not take a stand
on an issue of such importance
armed with only "newspaper arti-
cles. and a narrow mind. I will
not ask everyone to become radi-

cal. I merely askgall of you to

open up first your minds. then
your ears and lastly. but cauti-
ously your mouths.

PEP knows that new programs
bear the burden of hard analysis
of the substantiveness of their pur-
poses. They feel their program
bears this burden particularly.
since it can direct itself to one
of the most important issues of
our day. the relationship between
the Black man anti the white’
man's culture. What is the state
of the study of the traditions of
English letters today? Surely the
history of American literature can
be submitted to a Black interpre-
tation. But what of Chaucer. Pope
and Tennyson‘? Is the relevance
to their study under attack‘? If
not. why not‘? PEP feels that pur-
suing the answers to these ques-
tions can bring vitality to this
program and make it far more
than merely a process of expos-
ure.

'0” New Idea-Plan Own Course Si

ﬁe

UCIS Initiates Program

When one looks closely at the
complaints voiced recently by
University students. it will be no-
ticed that many students do not
feel that they are being given an
adequate voice in the courses they
must take. And when constructive
suggestions are made. they are

.frequentl_y squelched by admin-

istrative red tape.

Recognizing the educational po-
tentual within this problem. the
University Center for Internation-
al Studies (UClSl has announced
a plan whereby students may de-
sign their own courses on any sub-
ject relating to international stu-
dies. ’

According to Arnold Miller. po-
litical science teacher. this pro-
gram is meant to encourage jun-
iors and seniors to make up their
own courses in areas which are
not covered by established classes.

“In this program,” Miller says,

. ‘‘we’re saying to the students,

‘What do you think is relevant for
your education? If you can come
up with a good idea, we’ll back
you.’ There’s real teeth behind
this proposal.”

Students may choose any for-

mat for their course: lecture. sem-

inar. etc. The class may involve
lab work. or use of facilitities
such as the computer center or
the language laboratory.

If the class is of the interdisci- .

plinary type. interdisciplinary
credit will be awarded. All the
self-designed courses will be
three-credit.

According to Miller, this is the
first time such a program has
been offered at the undergraduate
level at the University. “Courses
will be limited to the internation-
al area at first, since the program
is only on an experimental basis.

"If this plan is a success. the
other departments and schools
will hopefully set up a similar
kind of program." he said.

Taking a self-designed course
won't be a snap. though. Miller
emphasizes that “it takes a lot of
work to set up and plan a worth-
while course."

However, ,_it is felt by the de-
partment that the designing of a
course can be a worthwhile ex-
perience.

It is hoped that this sort of plan .

can enrich the concept of the
“self—designed major" by permit-
ting a student with definite ideas
to add exactly the sort of course
he wants to his curriculum.

Courses which prove to be
worthwhile {may be retained on
the curriculum. thereby tending
to fill in deficient areas in the
Universitys course selection:

Future plans for the program,
if it is successful, include the es-

The Governor objected to the I

bill because in its present form it
contains certain “amb_iguous'.'
clauses. Further. he doubted the
necessity of such a law in Penn-

sylvania. feeling that the problem,“

of campus demonstrations can
best be handled with a "firm"

stance by administrators. faculty. . -

and students themselves. _
Although Gov. Shaver did not

object to peaceful demonstra- . -. 

tions. he firmly opposed proce-
dures such as sit-ins in university
buildings. Emphasizing a "law-
and-order" approach. he told stu-
dents he couldonly sympathize
with those who utilized proper
administrative channels to air
their grievances.

In response to student accusa-
tions that the Board of Trustees

‘ of Penn State meets privately at-

unannounced times. the~Governor
promised to relay the request for
a student forum with the trustees!
Although he said University offi-
cials were wrong if theyrefused
to meet with students. he made it
clear that he did not believe the
students have exhausted all prop-
er channels. ' ,.

Gov. Shafer, while agreeing‘
that students should be represent-
ed -on the Board of Trustees, re-
fused to endorse the proposal
that student members have voting
rights. -

The Governor also discussed A A

the problem of increasing Black
enrollment at Penn State. stating
that the present number of 310
Blacks in a total enrollmentiof
25.000 should. and will be. in-
creased.

While strongly in opposition to
the lowering of academic stand-
ards to admit more Blacks. Gov.
Shafer mentioned that private
foundations and public funds are
being‘ used to help prepare cul-
turally underprivileged Black stu-
dents for college work.

The Governor stated that stu- i
dent rebels and professors w h 0
support any disruptive acts should
be disciplined. He avoided speci-
fic promises, and stressed his lack
of tolerance for threats, disorders,
violence, or coercion.

Gov. Shafer also said he was

not aware of any “direct evidence‘ _

of conspiracy in the campus dis-
orders. but I do know certain in-
dividuals appear at all or most of
the campus disorders. " -

"The human body is a factory

the question is what to do with
it." So began Dr. Harry Baum.

tionship," a part of the Sex and

’’ Sexuality series.

Baum explained to an audience
of about 200 how this energy has
been misplaced in our society.
"Our generation is aware of sex-
ual intercourse." he stated. "Un-
fortunately. our society is set up
so that is all we are aware ot'. But
this is only one way of expressing
the relationship between a man
and a woman."

He went on to trace how these
misconceptions have developed.
“The woman is a second class cit-
izen who lives under our male

values of a double standard. The.

girl is conditioned by her mother

The boy. likewise. is indoctrin-
acted into the double standard.
"Children are natural imitators."
said Baum. "and they see mommy
and daddy as natural enemies be-
cause of this double standard."

"We‘ve got to stop the double
standard." emphasized Dr. Baum.
"in the same way weve got to
stop double standard between
black and white. We can't wait
for the Messiah to come — he may
like it this way.“

Baum then complained about
the way in which people never

really relate to one another.~

uality. “Guys say, ‘I can’t love
her — she's not a 38 C.’ Wouldn’t
it just be easier for him to buy a
38 C cup and carry it around in
his pocket?”

Baum then proposed a plan for
sex education. "Human relations
can only be done by learning to
reach out and touch and be with
each other." He suggested that
sex education begins by teaching
parents how to relate to their chil-
dren. “Parents come to me and
ask how they can talk to their
children. “I can't tell him about
intercourse: if I tell him about
contraceptions. he'll go out and
try it."

Baum then went on to explain
how a good relationship must be
built
"There is no love in the sexual
act per se. it's simply a mechan-
ical act." But. a human relation-

'ship is a three part system: “bio-

logical. sociological and spirit-
ual." A good relationship needs
all of these. he concluded. and
love is the genuine feeling that
makes the relationship right.

— it doesn‘t just happen.

Six Varsity Marks Fall

During Delaware Meet  

by ED CONLEY

Jim Banner insists that he doesn’t care about records when
his track teams go into action, but the way things are turning
out few people are likely to believe him any more. He can thank
his present varsity thinclads_for this.

The tracksters broke_six more marks, Saturday, in the Delaware

Invitational as the dominated the action, giving them records in ten of

a possible thirteen varsity events. V

Bryant Salter contributed as
much as anyone in the meet. He
won both the high jump and triple
jump competition. and finished
second in the broad jump. His
48’ 2” leap in the triple jump
broke a thinclad mark, despite
the fact that it was the first time
Salter tried the leap this season.

The field-event king already
held the records in the other two
jumps and once again he failed to
pass his best performance of the
winter in the high jump; he clear-

~ ed 6’8” again.

“With all the compeition (in the
high jump) there was still nobody
pressuring him and he had already
been in the broad jump and the
triple, too.” Banner mentioned.

Salter’s test in the triple jump
wasn’t the only new side to the
track story. Saturday. Banner de-
cided to let John Aiken run the
1000-yard. and the experiment
proved a gem. Alden couldn‘t
win the race, but he did break the
varsity mark by one-tenth of a sec-
ond. clocking in at 2: 13.2.

Another surprise came in the
two mile race. Mark Vornhagen
also broke a thinclad record with
a 9:09 time, and he won his race,
too.

Of course. most of the expected
winners came through also. Jerry
Richey bettered his mile mark
with a 4206.3 run. the mile relay
team improved its record with a
3:17.7 performance, and the two-

mile relay squad won their chase. .
' missing their current mark by

three-tenths of a second.

A couple of outstanding fetes
occured in the relay races. Richey
ran his leg of the two-miler in 1:
52.6 and Smitty Brown turned in a
fast 47.8 quartermile in the mile
relay.

Brown ran into a littletrouble
in his specialty, the 600-yard
run, however. He finished fourth
with a 1:12 time behind the win-
ner’s (St. John’s Phil Maresca)
1:ll.7 clocking. ‘

“Smitty got boxed in and
couldn't get out." Banner explain-
ed, “He was catching them at the
end. but got caught himself. It's
just one of those things."

The coach was enthused with
Greg Ellis’ heave in the shot put.
Saturday. thinking that the 52’ 9“
distance was also a new mark. It
wasn’t. though. Ellis threw for a
52’ 10‘/2" distance earlier in the
season.

The freshmen that competed
Saturday were successful, too.
The frosh medley relay quartet
won their chase in 7:59.3.

In fact. the only unfortunate part
of the trip to Delaware was the ab-
sence of one of the tracksters.
Hurdler Elliot Drysdale missed

the trip because of an auto acci-
dent last week. Surgery savedhis
life after his ‘Volkswagen flipped

’ over. and the thinclad is now on the

road to recovery in-th'e‘Passavant

Brawl Mars Contest

by JERRY L. GRUEBEL
Assistant Sports Editor

The cagers finished their
most dismal season in 63 years
in a most dismal way, losing
to Carnegie—Mellon University
Saturday for the first time in
28 games, 68-64.

With the exception of the 1905-
1906 ‘season. when the cagers
finished with a 2-9 mark. this
season was the least productive
in the University’s history.

CMU’s Skibo Gym became a
first come, first-served wres-
tling arena with 0:54 left in the
first half. There was a scramble

for a loose ball and before any-
one knew what happened a few
punches were thrown.

soon, both benches were emptied,
and then some of the spectators
climbed down from the stands to
contribute to the action. The only
minor casualty was suffered by
freshmen basketball coach Tim
Grgurich, who was TKO’d with a
bloody nose and two punches to
the head. Grgurich did not sit on
the bench in the second half.

After a five-minute cooling-off
period both teams failed to score
for the remainder of the half. as
CMU walked off with a 31-23.
lead at the intermission. ’ ‘

 
  

Cubs Finish Frosh Career
Victoriously With 20   Point
Decision Against CMU JV’s

  

 
 

 

by BILL NAAB

The Cubs are now Panthers. In their final game of the sea-
son", the Panther basketball frosh whipped the Carnegie—Mellon

‘JVs 86-66.

Varsity Coach Buzz Ridl remarked that he was satisfied with the
work and improvement of the Cubs during the season. However. fresh-
man coach Tim Grgurich stated that the freshman year is over. and the
moment that the buzzer sounded the entire team became members of the

varsity.

He also mentioned that the
Cubs are “the best freshman
team we've had. potentially. but.
potential doesn't mean a thing.
You have to bring it out."

Grgurich further explained that
it’s difficult to play as a sopho-
more; therefore his men must
spend a great deal of time on
their weak points, possibly as
much as 6 to 10 hours each day in
the summer. “There’s no point to
stop improving. You can’t reach
a plateau,” he said.

The point of perfection might-
_ be. an /impossible ,g_Qa'1.? but 

 

guard Steve Lewis came mighty
close to a perfect field goal per-
centage. He connected on 13 of
17 shots from the rival CMU floor.
He scored a game high 26 points
and could have easily passed over
the 30 mark had he not missed
"about 7 or 8 minutes of action.

Lewis was not the only Cub
who had the scoring touch. how-
ever. Reserve guard Dave Vaughn
popped through 6 field goals and
3 free throws for a 15 point total.

 Track Team Continues Breaking Records

Matmen Break F ive-Year Penn State Jinx
  Wrestlers Rally for Tie, 0
But ‘Should Have Won’ 7

by MARTHA HARTLE -   = 
Assistant Sports Editor

It was only last year that, the Penn State President comment-
ed that Pitt could never compete on the same, level as the Nit-—.»
tany Lions in wrestling — but Dave Adams’ grapplers didn’tbi'1y»-
that line Saturday as they came from behind to earn a draw with .,

the highly favored Penn Stater
16-16. »

It was the first time in five
years that the varsity hasn‘t lost
to Penn State. and according to
Adams. "we could have won it at
several places. "

“It was a pretty exciting match.
I’m not satisfied because we
could have won it. But our boys
gave a real good effort and made
a real fine showing.”

The Varsity needed wins in three
of the last four bouts to earn
the draw, and Bob Kuhn. Paul Al-
len and Ralph Cindrich ‘came
through with those wins in the 167,
191 and heavyweight bouts re-
spectively. Pat Lavery had won the
only decision for the matmen up
to that time, while both Mark
Payne and Buddy Morris drew.

Adams called Payne’s' bout
with Clyde Frantz at 145 “one
of the finest bouts I‘ve‘ seen for
some time. They’re two mighty
fine wrestlers. I don‘t want to
make any exc/uses. but Mark did

Shh!  CMU Beats Hoopsters

The eager problem was obvious.
Not only did the men of Ridl have
difficulty putting the (ball through
the nets. but they also had diffi-
culty in stopping an inspired Tar-
tan five.

Freshman guard Bob Brown
caused the most damage in the
first half. The ex-Westinghouse
High School star, who has been
averaging better than 20 points
per game during his last nine
games, poured in five early
baskets. Brown had no trouble
driving past the varied eager de-
fenses.

With 4:05 left in the half. Brown
was charged with an offensive foul
— his third foul of the afternoon.
The 6’3" freshmen varsityman
was then lifted until 4:55 remain-
ing in the game.

The Tartan‘s other starting
guard. senior Snow Mitchell. also
sat on the bench most of the sec-
ond half because of_ foul trouble.
But the hoopsters couldn‘t take
advantage of the situation.

Mark Lang, the second high-
est scorer in Tartan history, pick-
ed up where Brown left off. Lang
pumped in 12 points in the second
half, finishing with 20 points. The
senior leaper also grabbed 10 re-
bounds. -

“The only thing I like about to-
day," Said Ridl. trying to smile
after the game. “is that it's all
over."

The hoopsters, who finished
with only four wins in their twen-
ty four game schedule, could have
taken lessons from the alumni.
In a 10:30 A.M. start, cager alumi
routed CMU’s former roundball-
ers, 99-80.

Allen, Kuhn, Lavery and Cind-

with a decision over Tom Hartz-A,

Rabel, Kuhn won his sixth match
in eight outings with a 6-5 de-
cision over Jim Crother and Lav-
ery ran his record ‘to 8-1 with .a_
3-2 win over Dick Keefe.

“Pat did a steady good job.“
commented Adams. “Keefe (a
junior college national championlfi.
is a real tough boy.” 

Cindrich once again went into i
the final bout with the pressure on
for a pin. but Adams explained
that “the Penn ‘State guy was
simply out there not to get.

In other bouts, Tom Grant (123),

Cuba (130) dropped a 4-1 decision
to Dana Balum; Marty Poehl (152)
was blanked by Bob Abraham,“

“Cuba wrestled well and did all '7

Adams. “He pushed the guy for "

down right at the end of the match
and won. "

Finish 1-9 Season  
 Gym Loses To Orange

by MIKE WALDHOLZ

3. Full of hope and with the subtle air of confidence, the
gymnasts‘ headed for Syracuse last Saturday with the purpose of

ending their dual season with a victory. They returned home
Saturday evening with nothing to show for the day except a
shocking loss by the score of 109.98 - 97.08.

For the last few weeks coach Warren Neiger had instilled
within the gymnasts the feeling that they could defeat Syracuse. The
reason being that Syracuse had had some really poor showings in their
last few meets. They had lost one meet with the extremely low score

' v of 80 points.

track team in 1931.

The varsity baseball team has

liketo play the games in Forbes

licks in.

Incidentally, with one dual
meet remaining for both the
wrestling and track teams, the
winter sports’ combined record is
27-49-1 (‘.342 won-lost percent-
age). If the records of all fresh-
man teams are subtracted, the re-
cord is only 12-42-1 (.222 won-

ball team turned in losing streaks
of seven and ten games, the swim-
mers five meets, the gymnasts six
meets, and the wrestlers three-
meets.

that starting next year freshmen

that next year will be better and
things are looking up. But after.
the basketball team lost to Car-

After my junior year, I thought
that the basketball team should
play a small-time schedule in-
stead of the present one. But they
can't even beat CMU. That’s the
most humiliating thing that has
happened to our athletic reputa-
tion since the hiring of Carl De-
Pasqua as football coach.

The only sports in this school
that have reached respectability
are track and wrestling. My sol-

fr1f1"E ‘PITT NEWS'—Monday, March 3, 1969.

Engineering and Science at IBM

“You’re treated
like a professional
right from the start’

“The attitude here is, if you’re good enough to be
hired, you’re good enough to be turned loose on a
project,” says Don Feistamei.

Don earned a B.S.E.E. in 1965. Today, he’s an
Associate Engineer in systems design and evalua-
tion at IBM. Most of his work consists of determin-
ing modifications needed to make complex
data processing systems fit the specialized
requirements of IBM customers.

Depending on the size of the project, Don
works individually or in a small team. He’s
now working with three other engineers on
part of an air traffic control system that will
process radar information bycomputer.
Says Don: “There are only general guide-
lines. The assignment is simply to come

up with the optimum system.”

Set your own pace

Recently he wrote a simulation program that
enables an IBM computer to predict the per-
formance of a data processing system that will
track satellites. He handled that project him-
self. “Nobody stands over my shoulder,” Don
says. ‘‘I pretty much set my own pace.”

Don’s informal working environment is typi-
cal of Engineering and Science at IBM. No
matter how large the project, we break it
down into units small enough to be handled
by one person or a few people.

Don sees a lot of possibilities for the future.

He says, “My job requires that I keep up to
date with all the latest IBM equipment and
systems programs. With that broad an outlook,
I can move into almost any technical area at
|BM—development, manufacturing, product
test, space and defense projects, programming
or marketing.”
