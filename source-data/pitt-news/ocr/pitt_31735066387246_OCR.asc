Specter discusses suspended cancer project

By Christine Hanna
Editor in Chief

U.S. Senator Arlen Specter (R-Pa.) met
with University of Pittsburgh officials
Monday to discuss the National Surgical
Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project’s test-
ing that has been suspended for six weeks.

The National Cancer Institute requested
that no more patients be admitted to the
study because of reports of research fraud
by a Canadian investigator at St. Luc’s
Hospital in Montreal, and because of con-

cerns about data management and audit-
ing procedures at the NSABP headquar-
ters here at Pitt.

Also, at this time the NCI requested that
Dr. Bernard Fisher resign as director and
that an interim leader of the federally
funded NSABP be appointed. Dr. Robert
B. Herberman, director of the Pittsburgh
Cancer Institute, was appointed as interim
chair of the NSABP by Senior Vice
Chancellor for Health Sciences Thomas
Detre.

“It is with the seriousness of breast can-

cer and because the testings have been
suspended now for a period of six weeks,
and in the matter of national interest, it is
[of] the utmost importance that the testing
of breast cancer continue, whether it is
here or elsewhere,” said Specter, who is
the ranking Republican on the Senate
Appropriations Subcommittee on Health
and Human Services.

“The Pittsburgh officials have said very
forcefully they feel that the actions of the

National Cancer Institute have been unfair

Lung lobe transplant recipient dies

By Christine Hanna
Editor in Chief

The 25-year-old Western
Pennsylvania man who
received two lower—lung lobes
from his father and an uncle
April 28 at Presbyterian
University Hospital died
Thursday at 5 p.m.

The man, who had cystic
fibrosis, died from an infection
which he had prior to the trans-

plant, the first ever done at Pitt.

“Basically his infection that
he started with before the oper-
ation created a situation where
the lungs became  very frag-
ile,” said Dr. Robert Keenan,
director of Pitt’s adult lung
transplant program.

Keenan also said the right

side of the heart, which is

responsible for pumping blood
to the lungs, failed.
According to Keenan, the

man and his family turned to
the living-lung lobe transplant,
which takes two lower-lung
lobes from living relatives, as a
last attempt to save his life.
Keenan said the man was with-
in days to a week of dying.

The family, who asked not to
be identified, had already lost

sis — a child at birth several

Cafeteria
overhaul
planned

for Towers

By Matt.Groff

Asst. News Editor

A major overhaul of the
Towers Cafeteria will soon be
underway in order to offer Pitl
students several dining options
as well as a chance to do‘ their
grocery shopping on campus.

According to Director oi
Food Services Betsy Sallade-
Farina, Marriott Food Corp.
has designed plans to convert
the Tower A cafeteria into a
hybrid of Schenley Food Court
and a grocery store by the
beginning of the fall term.

“This project is experimental
and a very different retail oper-
ation than any other university
has done,” said Sallade-Farina,
who noted the plans are in
response to a recent survey oi
students and input from stu-
dent members of the Food
Committee.

“With Marriott’s help, we
did a survey of what students
wanted on campus,” Sallade-
Farina said. “It was no surprise
to anyone that students are
looking for more retail
options.”

Pitt physicists involved in quark research group

By John B. Moore

News Assistant

Over 16 years of research
conducted by 440 physicists at
36 universities around the
world has resulted in the dis-
covery of the last unconﬁrmed
particle believed to be the
basic building block of matter.

Two University of
Pittsburgh physicists, Eugene

Engels and Paul Shepard, were
part of the national research
group collaborating on the
Collider Detector at Ferrnilab
project (CDF).

Engels and Shepard, were
responsible for leading a team
of seven experimental particle

physicists at Pitt.
The elusive subatomic parti-
cle was discovered at

Fermilab, near Chicago, on

April 22.

According to Engels, the
apparent large mass of the top
quark is the reason why its dis-
covery had eluded researchers
for so long. The more massive
a subatomic particle, the more
energy is required to produce
it in collisions, making it hard-
er to find.

Finding the missing piece to
the most widely accepted theo-

ry of the nature of matter cost
hundreds of millions of dollars
and had been searched for
since 1977.

The theory justifying its
search, known as the Standard
Model, states there are six
kinds of quarks.

The latest one found is
known simply as “top.” The
ﬁve others are known as “up,”

Instead of caning, District

The charges of vandalism

Provost position clown

to three candidates

By Frank Porco

Opinions Editor

And then there were three.

The search for a new
provost, initiated last year after
Donald Henderson’s
announcement to retire, is now
in its final stages and a list of
the three finalists was
announced Friday.

-Dr. Robert Griffith, dean of
the College of Arts and
Humanities, and professor of
history, University of
Maryland at College Park.

-Dr. James Gunton, dean of
the College of Arts and
Sciences and professor of
physics, Lehigh University.

°Dr James Maher, chair of

the department of physics
and astronomy and professor
of physics, University
of Pittsburgh.

The three finalists will
take part in campus interviews
with O’Connor and other
members of the senior admin-
istration in the next few
weeks.

Chancellor J. Dennis
O’Connor selected the three
finalists from a list of
seven submitted to him
in late April by Dean
of Graduate Studies
and Faculty of Arts and
Sciences Mary Lou Soffa,
chair of the Senior Vice
Chancellor and Provost Search
Committee.

Quark

°From page 1
“down, strange,” “charm” and “bottom.”

The Pitt team was responsible for part of the
equipment used to detect the particles, and have
participated in the data gathering, analysis and
interpretation of that data.

“The Pitt group presently is concentrating its
efforts on new detector components to exploit
the new evidence for top production,” said
Shepard.

The CDF researchers are not claiming an
outright discovery of the “top” quark until
they obtain more statistical evidence of its exis-
tence. ,

But Shepard and Engels said they, along with
the other researchers, plan to confirm the parti-
cle’s existence in a few months after gathering
more additional top events.

“We have not yet observed enough examples
of ‘top’ quark production to establish the parti-
cle’s existence beyond question,” according to
Shepard.

“Nevertheless, this new evidence points
strongly to the sixth and final quark that we

99 £6

.2

have been seeking for so long.”

“Modern theories about particle physics
depend heavily on the quark outcome,” Engels
said.

“If the ‘top’ quark turned out not to exist, we
would have to go back and seriously rethink
everything we know about particle physics,”
Shepard said.

Engles and Shepard said because of the heavy
weight of the ‘top’ quark it probably played a
role in how the cosmos evolved since its origin
with “the Big Bang.”

“Heavier particles probably determined
the path of evolution and the ‘top’ quark
is the heaviest of the six subatomic particles
that comprise the Standard Model,” according
to Engels.

The weight of the “top” quark is estimated at
174 billion electron volts, more than 40,000
times as heavy as the “up” quark and 40 times
as massive as the “bottom” quark, the closest in
weight.

Universities in Canada, Italy, Japan and
Taiwan were also involved in the research.

and that the protocols have
been correct and if there is fur-
ther delay and the studies are
taken away from this institu-
tion there will be a resulting
damage to the effort to find a
cure to breast cancer.”

Kara Smigel, spokesperson I

for the NCI, said the NSABP
must make the appropriate
changes.

The ballpark figure for more
people being added to the stud-
ies is July, but could be sooner
if the changes are more quick-
ly made.

Smigel said the concern lies
in the project’s failure to keep
up with auditing.

According to the University
of Pittsburgh Medical Center
News Bureau, the NSABP
studies have been responsible
for proving that breast cancer
does not require disfiguring
surgery.

Instead of a mastectomy,
the studies showed that a
lumpectomy with radiation is
an appropriate treatment, a
point which NCI affirmed, said
Dr. Jeffrey Romoff, president
of UPMC.

Romoff also said tamoxifen
for people with breast cancer
as well as prevention trials
using tamoxifen are appropri-
ate treatments.

“Dr. Fisher has begun today

to defend himself,” Romoff
said.

Fisher spoke Monday at the
American Society of Clinical
Oncology Health Seminar in
Dallas.

As reported in the Houston
Chronicle, Fisher spoke for an
hour discussing data from 22
studies concluding that
lumpectomy is just as effective
as mastectomy in treating early
breast cancer.

The Houston Chronicle
reported that Fisher excluded
all data from patients at St.
Luc’s when he reexamined all
of the 22 studies. The conclu-
sions were the same, with or
without the questionable

 

patients, he said.

“Dr. [Carol] Redmond [a
biostatitician] and I have dedi-
cated a lifetime in the pursuit
of honest and credible results
from research that would bene-
fit women and those with col-
orectalcancer. While we  are
completely devastated as a
result of the current events, we
are even more concerned about
the effect of those events on all
women — those with and
those without breast cancer,”
Fisher said at the seminar.

“They must not become vic-
tims of this scenario.
Specifically they must be
assured that they have received
appropriate therapies,” Fisher

Food

°From page 1

Hussey of Facilities
Management, have been plan-
ning the food court with

Marriott, which is in charge of .

food service at Pitt.

“We have been working to
develop a very broad plan
which will give students the
ﬂexibility they want,” DeVitto
said. He said once the renova-
tions are completed, Food
Services will have a wide
range of facilities available to
students.

Instead of the traditional
steam-table service, Sallade-
Farina said the cafeteria
counter will be converted to
individual serving stations.
She said the food—court area
will be similar to the setup of
the Schenley Food Court cur-
rently in the William Pitt

Union, but will feature differ-

ent food options.

“We have approached
Burger King about setting up
[in the new food court],”

 

Sallade—Farina said. “However,
nothing is ﬁnal yet.”

She said plans are also in
place to invite a gourmet
pasta/pizza vendor as well as a
franchise of a fish/deli chain.
A bagel-serving area, deli-
catessen and salad station will
also likely be set up by Food
Services and Marriott.

and a small grocery store will
be two of these areas. “There
is a big demand on campus for
baked goods and traditional
soda—fountain items.”

The grocery store, along
with all other serving areas,
will allow students to buy
items individually or in bulk.

The Pitt News, Wednesday, May 18, 1994

is for each smaller room to
have a theme to make it
unique.”

DeVitto said another advan-
tage of the new setup will be
the availability of food all day.

Even though most of the
food—court stations will only be
serving during the traditional
dinner times, Sallade-

“We also hope to have
one or two ‘sandwiches of
the day’ available,”
Sallade—Farina said. “If 
it’s turkey, [students] will ‘
see the turkey [breast]
being cut right in front of
their eyes. We learned that
students want to see the
food being prepared, and
in most cases, the food

 

Farina said the dining-
room area will probably
be open from 11 a.m. to
11 p.m. and offer televi-
sion in some sections of
- the dining room.

“Some of the areas,
such as the grocery store
and bakery, would proba-
bly stay open and stu-
dents could use the dining

preparation will be very visi-
ble.” She said there
will also be serving stations
positioned apart from the food
court area.

“Some stations will be in the

The answer to the test question

Sallade—Farina said all food
will be available for take-out
for students who choose not to
eat in the dining room area.
“Our hope is that students
will be able to come in and
buy, for example, a corned
beef sandwich or a pound of
corned beef, a bagel to eat with

_ lunch or a dozen bagels,” she
«5 said. “Students will now have
 l more power to choose what
 they want to eat and when they

will eat it.”

Students who choose to eat
in the dining room will find it
to be “an entirely new dining
experience.” According to
Marriott’s plans, the dining
room will be divided into
smaller eating areas.

“It is designed to make din-
more pleasurable,”

room most of the day,”
Sallade—Farina said. “We really
hope we are setting a new stan-
dard for food service on cam-
pus.”

According to Sallade—Farina,
students who do not live in the
Towers will have easier access
to the new food court through
a direct entrance which will be
constructed from the steps
between Forbes Avenue and
the Towers.

Despite the renovations,
which DeVitto called “mas-
sive”, he said students will not
be paying significantly higher
prices for food.

"The prices will be very rea-
sonable, just as they are in the
Schenley food court,” DeVitto
said. At most, DeVitto said
students may see a 2 to 3 per-
cent increase in food prices.

He said Pitt and Marriott are
sharing expenses for the pro-
ject

“This is the way people eat
these days,” DeVitto said. “As
old as the Towers Cafeteria is,
we figured it made sense to
renovate it in a way which stu-
dents are asking for.”

He said their goal is to keep
the quality and service high
without increasing prices. “We
are making sure the quality of
food is not diluted.” DeVitto
also said Pitt has responded to
complaints about the format of
meal plans.

“Students have complained
they don’t want to eat exactly a
set number of meals each
week,” DeVitto said. “They
want ﬂexibility.”

In order for students to pay
for their food, Food Services
has replaced the former meal
plan, of 19, 14, 10 and five
meals, with a “block” plan

A cash equivalency will be
established for each meal on
the block plan, but students
can use the blocks, which are
not based upon weeks, as they
choose.

“A student can eat all break-
fasts if he/she wants,” Sallade-
Farina said. “Also, a student
can use his block to pay for
other people.”

She said Tower C Cafeteria
will remain set up as it current-
ly is, but all cafeterias will be
taking steps “to make the stu-
dents more comfortable with
dining at Pitt.”

America, the health of
America, to be a political foot-
ball. And that’s what it may be
becoming, at least according
to what I’ve heard here this
morning.”

Specter said he talked to
Fisher, Redmond and
Herberman on a conference
call from Dallas.

“I don’t know whether
Dr. Bernard Fisher is right
or wrong. The paramount
concern is what’s happening
to women who suffer
from breast cancer and the
risk of‘ breast cancer,” Specter
said.

“And to have a suspension of
these kinds of studies I know
is unwise. The National
Cancer Institute has an obliga-
tion to lay the facts on the
table and take directive action
objectively,” Specter said.

“A six—week interruption is
not a good idea; but if it’s
going to be a longer interrup-
tion that’s a worse idea. And I
think that’s a question which
I want to have an immediate
answer to.”

The NSABP has cooperated
fully with the federal govern-
ment’s Office of Research
Integrity, Romoff said. At no
time prior to the publication of
the Chicago Tribune article
showing that St. Luc’s submit-
ted fraudulent data did the

NCI or National Institutes of
Health, which also funds the
project, have problems
with Dr. Fisher. Romoff
said this leads UPMC to
believe other things are going
on and based on the facts,
Fisher and the NSABP deserve
to continue to do this kind of
work.

The other things, Romoff
said, include political pressure
out of Washington, D.C.

“We believe the National
Cancer Institute is concerned
about itself, it gets political
pressure from committees of
the House of Representatives,”
Romoff said.

“Its immediate reaction is
to try to find a way to re-
spond to those criticisms
directly and we think
the NSABP has become
hostage to that response,”
Romoff said.

Romoff said with the
NSABP being hostage, it
makes the women of this

country hostage as well.

Specter said he would
review the representation from
Pitt officials; talk to Dr.
Samuel Broder, director of the
NCI, find out what his specific
findings are; and ask Broder
what action he’s taking to see
to it that these studies are rein-
stated.

“I am concerned that unless
we continue the pace that
we’ve kept or started with
breast cancer research, [we’re
going] to be pushed too far
back and we just can’t afford
that,” said Sue Harkins, a
regional coordinator for the
Pennsylvania Breast Cancer
Coalition and a breast—cancer
survivor.

"The studies, the protocols
through the NSABP, have
been wonderful in that they’ve
given us hope and they
are doing the scientific experi-
ments that we need to
do here,” according to
Harkins.

daughter, who was waiting for a
transplant, a month and a half
ago.

When their son was admitted
to another hospital for severe
respiratory distress, they needed
another option other than wait-
ing for a cadaver lung trans-
plant. The family and their
physicians turned to the
University of Pittsburgh
Medical Center for help.

Prior to this, Keenan and Dr.
Bartley P. Griffith, chief of car-
diothoracic surgery, visited the
University of Southern Califor-
nia, where 11 such transplants
have been performed. Ten of
the 11 USC recipients are alive
and doing well, he said.

When Pitt’s situation arose,
the surgeons went to the med-
ical center’s institutional review

board and received compassion-
ate clearance to perform the liv-
ing—lobe transplant.

Currently the surgeons are
starting the process of getting
ﬁnal clearance for future living-
lung transplants; the IRB is
reviewing revisions to the first
protocol which was_ submitted
on this procedure. Keenan said
the recipient’s death should not
hinder more living-lobe trans-
plants from occurring; once the
IRB gives final clearance, he
expects another 10 transplants
to be done this year.

But he said in the future they
would be a little more selective
in trying not to use transplant
recipients who are so ill.

However, he said there are no
regrets in doing the initial trans-
plant. “We tried our best,” he
said.

Support medical democracy

For ﬁve long years American women have waited for medical
technology which has been available to Europeans all along —
the controversial French abortion pill, R.U.-486.

After President Clinton lifted the previous administration’s ban
on the abortion pill, the French manufacturer of the_pill, Roussel-
Uclaf, announced Monday to donate its U.S. patent rights to the
non—profit contraceptive research organization, Population
Council — ridding itself of product-liability claims.

After it is deemed safe by the FDA, it will be Population
Council’s task to locate an American company to market and
manufacture the pill, which will terminate a pregnancy within
seven weeks of conception.

Anti-abortion organizations have threatened to boycott the
American company the council chooses to make and market the
pill. Outside of the Bush administration’s ban, those threats are
one of the reasons the drug was not introduced before, along with
threats of product liability.

The pill will not be available to American women until 1996,
although between 150,000 to 200,000 women have taken the
drug in Europe since 1989.

American women are entitled to the same medical technology
other women around the world are; we can only hope certain spe-
cial interest groups do not stand in the way of medical democra-

cy.

Po/ifics hurts studies

Pitt’s suspension of the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and
Bowel Project's testing has cast the study to a level of national
negative speculation.

The National Cancer Institute banned patients from being
admitted to the study because of fraudulent data collected from
St. Luc’s Hospital in Montreal. Speculation about the inaccura-
cies involved auditing procedures at the NSABP headquarters
located at Pitt.

“This subject is too important for the women of America, the
health of America, to be a political football,” said U.S. Senator
Arlen Specter, when he met with Pitt officials yesterday to dis-
cuss the issue.

Yet in the highly politicized arena of medical research, it has
become exactly that, a political football, the irony being that
political bureaucracy, in its attempt to help victims of breast can-
cer, is paralyzing the studies organized at Pitt; in the end, harm-
ing the intended beneficiaries of these pioneering medical pro-
jects, in this case, all women.

Women will once again be permitted entrance to the program
come July, given the necessary changes be made to the current

‘program. We strongly urge the NSABP to quickly make the nec-

essaiy adjustments and get the studies reinstated as soon as pos-
sible.

After years
 of bloodshed,

 demonstra-
 and
political pos-
turing from
 all sides,
- April saw the

lgpllgmnist first all-race
lc . elections in

South Africa.
‘There’s one obvious winner —
African National Congress
President Nelson R. Mandela,
who just fourishort years ago
was in prison on charges of
terrorism.

The ultimate losers, howev-

 
  
  
 
   

years later, the ANC was dri-
ven underground and began
engaging in violent (but, ulti-
mately, ineffective) activities.
Mandela was jailed in 1964 for
his part in a number of bomb-
ings.

. But it wasn’t until 1976,
when around 400 black chil-
dren were slaughtered by
police during a demonstration,
that the howls of protest in the
United States and around the
world really began. Apartheid
was seen for what it really was
—- a brutal caste system in
which the black man was good
only for serving the white
man. Protest and study groups

claiming that they “would only
hurt the blacks.” That there
was considerable black unem-
ployment beforehand appar-
ently didn’t seem to matter, so
blind were they to what the
blacks really wanted -—- to
vote. And, lo and behold, the
sanctions actually worked.

But the right still didn’t quit.
There were more black stooges
on the circuit, trying to disrupt
the election, and some of them
even said that Mandela was
not the choice of most black
South Africans. Whom did
they think they were fooling?
On‘ top of that, they insisted

ing). Most’ rightist
groups boycotted the
simply

conservatives in South because they knew

about to lose.

No one seemed to notice
when apartheid was imple-
mented back in
Supposedly it was an experi-
ment to have different ethnic
groups pretty much run their
own affairs with as little inter-
ference as possible.

There was one big problem.
The whites ultimately had
most of the land and all of
the political power, and if
anyone really believed that
would have been agreeable to
the black majority they should
have had their head examined!
But it seemed as if the “right”
actually expected that.

Almost as soon as anti--

apartheid groups formed in
South Africa, they were
accused of being communist.
The Suppression of
Communism Act in 1950,
while its stated aim was to ban
the South African Communist
Party, effectively labeled many
organizations as such. Ten

sprang up here to find away to
defeat the system.

So why am I criticizing the
conservatives? Well, consider
that they had always denied
the problem, focusing rather
on a possible Soviet takeover
and failing to recognize that it
was apartheid that may have
driven black South Africans
under the “hammer and sickle”
to begin with.

The fact that both the ANC
and SACP were officially
banned made them natural
allies. Furthermore, the con-
servatives swallowed the gov-
ernment line, praising as a
hero every black well-paid
ﬂunky that came across their
path, insisting that each was
the leader that really wanted to
get rid of apartheid (when in
fact, the government had no
plans to do so).

Conservatives also displayed
their ignorance of the situation
when they opposed American
sanctions on South Africa,

they could not win.
And, most ironically, many of
them now support the concept
of homelands — which was
part and parcel of the ideology
of apartheid in the first place.
Talk about hypocrisy!

It’s impossible for me" to feel
sorry for the conservatives in
this situation; as far as I’m
concerned, they’ll have to take
their medicine for having no
concern for justice. If their
worst fears — a one-party
Marxist state —— are realized
(which at this point is unlike-
ly), they will have no one but
themselves to blame.

Yo, what’s up ? My name is
Be-Bop and I’ll be kickin it
with ya for a while. My job is
to tell you about all the Phat
scope that’s happening in the
hip—hop industry and what’s
happening in Pittsburgh. So,
let’s get right to it shall we?

WPTS has had a lot of ﬂava
in the past and still does. From
M.C. Word , to Joe the Man
,to the Tenth Brotha Packin
Much, to Chilly Most, to
Blakk Steele and now the new
kids on the block the 40Ds.
The 40Ds are the latest crew to
wreck shop at 98.5. They bring
the funk for each show with
hardcore music and interviews
with the artists and insiders in
the hip—hop industry.

The 40Ds consist of three

members, J.D., DeeTee and
Tone. Each man has his own
separate ﬂava, and they know
how to kick it on their own.

J.D. (Jason Dunn) is the
man who runs turntables l and
2, as well as all of the little
technical things that are on the
show.

He should be no stranger to
you, with his work for The Pitt
News and his old show during
the fall semester on Thursday
nights, 11 to 1 a.m. He has
been at 98.5 for over a year

and has either worked with or.

listened to some of its most
famous jocks.

He got his start under Chilly
Most and the Tenth Brotha as
an intern in the spring of 1993.
While interning he paid his
dues and took notes and wait-

ed for his chance to ﬂow. Then
towards the end of the fall
semester of 1993 he got a shot
at the late-night spot on
Thursdays.

The show caught wreck but
had a short-lived successes
because of a schedule change.
Then in the middle of the
spring of ‘94 he took over the
Tuesday night show from 11 to
one, but he felt that the show
needed to take a different
direction.

One day while hanging out
with Blakk Steele on his show
he meet his crew to be.
DeeTee(Daren Taruel) and
Tone(Antonio Hunter) came
up to kickit with Steele when
the three meet, they clicked
right then and there. When that
happened J.D. invited the two

to come up to his show and
flow. They came up and that
show is still talked about to
this day.

That first show featured one
Pittsburgh premiere after
another and a real Phat inter-
view with the SD50s. The
interview (like all of the others
since then) by DeeTee who got

a lot of scope out of the SDs.'

Then we heard one of the phat-
est freestyles this side of New
York from Tone.

Since that first show the
crew has taken of. They have
done interviews with Black
Moon, The Beatnuts, Bobbito
to name a few and have done
Pittsburgh for Jeru the
Dammaja, Bigge Smalls, Nasty
Nas, Wu Tang Clan with
S.WV., and the crews personal

favorite the Jerky Boys. The
flavor is deep just like the
meaning of their name (which
DeeTee came up with and only
a few people actually know
what it means) and their love
for the big breasted women.
Their show is definitely one to
look for on Tuesday nights .So
when you here the them
music(Eric B. and Rakiams ,
Move The Crowd) get ya
tapes ready for the funk.

I gotta go but, next week I’ll
have some scope on the first
annual Source awards and who
knows what else. Remember
on Friday and Tuesday nights
at 7 p.m. check out 98.5
WPTS for all of the ﬂava from
A to Z. One love and I’m out.

Experimental Jet Set, Trash and No Star

Sonic Youth

DGC

It is something you lust for or abhor: a new Sonic
Youth release. Some are way too hip to enjoy post-
Sister Sonic, others are too preoccupied with their
protegees Royal Trux, Sebadoh, Pavement, etc 
Of course, there’s the Grateful Dead syndrome: the
New York City noise-rnongers are not kids any-
more  Wake up!! Experimental Jet Set, Trash and
N0 Star is here to set your pretty little indie candy-
ass straight. Sonic Youth is putting out great music,
enough said. It’s also printed on clear blue vinyl.
Cries of “sell out” are uncalled for and boring.
Sonic Youth’s newest release is not some new gim-
mick, it’s a tried-and-true formula that has been
consistent through the SST to the DGC days.

Many critics claim that Experimental Jet Set... is
the natural succession to the phenomenal major-
label debut, G00. It actually has the same producer,
Butch Vig, as its predecessor, Dirty. I like the
band’s false claim that the songs were lost tracks
from Sister. Ithas that drum sound and loose feel
of that album and was recorded in the same studio.
It also has elements from the dark and ominous
sounding Baa’ Moon Rising. Probably the most
striking feature of this album is its diversity.

“Winner’s Blues” is acoustic, for God’s sake!!
Sonic Youth Unplugged? It sounds disgusting. The
song is a pretty, stripped-down acoustic guitar
piece from Thurston Moore. “Am I awake? No not
today...” he delicately whines, as if singing through
one of those soup—can string phones. It sets up the
mood for the rest of the record: pensive, relaxing,
rambling.

“Bull in the Heather,” the first single, features
bassist Kim Gordan on vocals. Gone is the snotty
screaming she showcased on Dirty. Her vocals are
sooo sexy on this song. Mercy! When she taunts,
“Tell me that you wanna hold me” or “Time to tell
a dirty story” my adolescent Kim Gordon punk
rock fantasy is reborn. This song features some of
the snappiest danceable drum beats that Steve
Shelly has ever played — look out Happy

Mondays. .
“Screaming Skull” is a feedback drenched, guitar

  

doodling, simple power-rock homage to the scene
Sonic Youth digs: indie/punk. Names like SST,
Husker Du, SuperChunk and even the Lemonheads
are tossed around with obvious reverence. Sonic
Youth has been saying that these bands, as well as
past touring partners Dino Jr and Nirvana, bands
that were inﬂuenced by Sonic Youth, have in turn
inﬂuenced them to record the new album. This
song is a driving and ﬂattering tribute to the inde-
pendent “do it yourself” attitude that spawned a
great music tradition.

If there is a song on the album that could have fit
comfortably on Dirty it is “Self-Obsessed and
Sexee.” It reminds me of Dirty’s gems “Purr” and
“Chapel Hill” combined into one. It’s a song for all
the “Grrls” rioting like there’s no tomorrow. “I
remember when you first arrived  magic marker
on your belly button, all right” recounts Moore,
who later professes, “Schizo action make a scene 
self-obsessed and sexy in every way.”

Amidst the nods to trendsetting bands and groups
on the post-punk scene, a serious issue is also tack-
led with the song “Androgynous Mind.” The song
features weird, punched-in guitar bursts overtop a
catchy-guitar riff and describes a gay-bashing sce-
nario: “Now he’s kicked in the gut, they fucked
him up just enough.” Moore retorts that being gay
is “O.K, hey hey O.K!!” The song is tuff and
avoids the political correct polish for a gritty, real-
istic and compassionate approach. Sonic Youth has
made its anti-bigotry stance clear with songs like
“Youth Against Fascism.”

“Tokyo Eye” is quite intriguing. Some speculate
it is an homage to Yamatsuka Eye, Japanese noise

kl:A-n&ﬁ'I11;A.n1§.;.¢AAnLmmmxsxllInvt‘i1‘Qi1'r!|1n.l.tI>  .

 

artist and leader of the Boredoms. The problem is
that Eye isn’t from Tokyo, but the song does con-
tain similar elements of the Boredoms. It is a beau-
tiful mess of sampled cmbal crashes, noise bursts,
guitar screams, and power riffs. Regardless of what
Thurston is saying, the song proves that Sonic
Youth is still a viable, creative group pioneering the
whole noise-rock genre and elevating it into quality
music.

The only bad thing about the album is that gui-
tarist Lee Ranaldo doesn’t get to sing on the album.
Oh well, maybe next time. Experimental Jet. Set,
Trash and N0 Star is an album containing the light,
the raunchy, the preachy, and the rockin truth as
Sonic Youth sees it. It is refreshing to hear that the
band refused to refine -their sound for an MTV
audience; all the songs were first takes. The music
contains mastery from seasoned veterans without
sounding self-absorbed and sterile. Amen!

My Funny Valentine
Chet Baker
Paciﬁc Jazz

This is, perhaps, one of the latest late-night discs
I have ever experienced. It is like an undershirt
lying in the moonlight on a folding chair, drying
from a coffee stain. It’s like the ring twisting
around a newly engaged ﬁnger. This record made
me fall in love with everything that it’s about. It
recreates a deﬁnition of masculine sensitivity that
doesn’t allow the strong, sexual virility of humani-
ty to evaporate into the gender netherworld. Chet
Baker was, to sum it up in two words, a “Funny
Valentine.”

From the very beginning of the disc, Baker’s
voice and trumpet intersect in ways which only he
could concoct; his playing and singing styles are
similar in their overwhelmingly soft confidence
and exactness. Compilation producer Michael
Cuscuna has created a masterpiece in the song
choices and order: the ﬂow doesn’t let up for one
moment as each tune saunters into the next in that
egotistical sway which characterizes Baker’s
music.

To look at these songs individually is perhaps the

ANGST is the most important word
in the vocabulary of any high school
"alternative" provocateur. It is the word
which was used in reference to the
melancholy goth of bands like the Cure
and Joy Division, it was essential to the
life of Morrissey and the Smiths, and it
is vital to the techno—industrial sado-rock
practiced most thoroughly by WAX
TRAX! artists like KMFDM.

Tomorrow night, Thursday May 19,
Metropol will host what is being billed
as ANGSTfest, starring KMFDM and
their descendants, Chemlab and Sister
Machine Gun. Industrial music is heavy
metal for Northern Europeans, so expect
a lot of ﬂailing arms, ﬂying bodies, and
half—shaved heads this particular
Metropol night. The black concert t—shirt
is optimum wear, and combat boots are a
necessity for foot protection. Beyond the
audience, however, I recall KMFDM as
being one of the few industrial groups
that I could get into, back when I lived
with a Skinny Puppy fanatic. The group
is interesting, compulsively beat—laden,
and violently danceable in just the right
way. As for the name,use your imagina-
tion, or ask Chuck Van up at 'PTS for
friendly advice. KMFDM, Chemlab,
and Sister Machine Gun, May 19,

Metropol, 7p.m. for an all ages show.

I remember, a long, long time ago, a
little radio station out in bumblepoop
was getting interference from a fabulous
college station here in Pittsburgh on fre-
quency 98.5 FM. That must have been,
oh, 30 or 40 years back now, and it
seems that WPTS Pittsburgh is finally
changing its frequency in accordance
with FCC orders. To celebrate the begin-
ning of the work, "92.l" WPTS will hold
a no—holds-barred bash for free on the
William Pitt Union patio and lawn this
Saturday, May 21 from 10am to llpm.
That's right, thirteen hours of constant
music and a live broadcast from Bigelow
Blvd.

The event will include a cavalcade of
local music talent, from the famed to the
not-so-famed. Topping the bill in true
'PTS fashion will be local indie—rock
superstars Hurl and Homestead record-
ing artists Blunderbuss. The station
helped make these bands what they are,
and they in turn will tip their hats. Other
station favorites playing Saturday, and
rising stars in their own rights, include
the likes of the Final Iris C0., formerly
known as PopGun, and garage/surf rock

mistake of modern pop criti-
cism: they are not meant to be
heard as singles, the way they
were when recorded. Forty
years after these songs were
originally performed in the
studio, we must take these
recordings as part of an atmos-
phere, a feeling, which perhaps
is important for modern listen-
ers and newcomers to the
music, like myself, to examine.
What Baker accomplishes in
these songs is a reexamination
of the state of “love,” which
translates into our culture,
once again, as a new take on
the ever—volcanic battle of the
sexes.

On a song such as “It’s
Always You”, Chet Baker is
performing an act which is, in
modern times, practically
impossible. He is breaking
down the barrier between man
and woman, allowing us a
glimpse of an opened, sensi-
tive man, without destroying
his sexual identity. This entire
disc represents a time when
strength did not translate into
sexism; it has the same cultural
effect as Casablanca did visu-
ally.

Beyond cultural criticism, of
course, lies the “good/bad”
realm of record reviewing.
Obviously, this is a good disc.
Most people will think it is a
great disc, and a few, like
myself, will find themselves
unable to remove it from the
player. The word of the hour is
“smooth”, baby, and there’s no
escaping that word in this
paragraph: Chet Baker“ is
smooth as all hell, and if you
can listen to the songs on this
collection without swaying
your fingers, if you can hear
the trumpet solos on
“Someone to Watch Over Me”
or “It’s Always You” without
squinting your eyes and smil-
ing, and if you can bear to not
fall in love over the course of
these forty-five plus minutes,
then you’re a less candy-assed

man than I am, and that’s OK.

I heard a minor recently that
on his upcoming U.S. tour,
Johnny Cash will be backed by
the Melbourne-Berlin Nick
Cave connection called the
Bad Seeds. This could, per-
haps, be the best way for Cash
to redeem his present stature as
“Generation X” godfather,
because Nick Cave is, more
than any other modern cultural
icon, worthy of being deemed
the son of the Man in Black. It
is more than simply a twist of
fate, therefore, that brought
together the work of Cave, his
protege Simon Bonney (of
Crime and the City Solution),
and Johnny Cash with German
film director, und der
Schwarzemanner himself, Wim
Wenders.

Faraway, So Close is meant
to be a sequel to Wenders’
melancholy and heavenly clas-
sic Wings of Desire, in which
both Bonney and Cave made
cameo appearances. The
soundtrack to the film appears
to also be a sequel of sorts to
the cult classic soundtrack of
Wings. However, much like the
film according to our own Bill
Kirchner, the Far Away album
leaves us feeling as though our
desires have been foregone in
favor of sloppy mechanical
creations.

The first striking problem
with the Far Away album is
that it is formatted much like a
standard soundtrack, with a
few “potential hit” pop songs
in the beginning and the back-
ground music we learn to love
following. The Wings sound-
track interspersed Crime and
the City Solution with German
dialogue from the film and
incidental music, all in a con-
ceptual pattern which makes
the soundtrack step lightly like
the film, from moment to

moment. On the Far Away
album, we have a simple lay-
out which allows one to com-
pletely skip all the incidental
music with little trouble,
which gives it the feeling that
it is simply a collection of
songs from the film, not a
soundtrack.

Secondly, the strong choices
of songs on Wings of Desire is
not even attempted here. The
music at the end is of the same
caliber, if you get that far, but
the initial 12 songs haven’t the
continuity or the power which
one would expect. As I had
hoped, the Nick Cave selec-
tions are ﬂawless, especially in
the context of Wenders’
themes. His “Faraway, So
Close,” the lead track on the
album, is the disc’s most pow-
erful piece. It has the vaudevil-
lian abandonment, the head-
held-high barroom braying,
and the auto—destructive fasci-
nation with failure which has
grown to characterize Nick
Cave’s recent work as that of
one of the most mature and tal-
ented songwriters alive.
“Cassiel’s Song,” his second
piece on the album, is another
example of classic Cave,
though not quite as stirring as
the first.

Simon Bonney is the other
Wings of Desire survivor to
appear, though this time with-
out his acclaimed band Crime
and the City Solution. Bonney
has always followed somewhat

in Nick Cave’s footsteps with
Crime and on his solo album
“Forever.” These two songs
move on in the “Forever” tra-
dition, using country music the
way Cave used blues and
vaudeville, recreating the dark-
ness and evil of, perhaps, a
Hank Williams Sr. or, more
appropriately, Johnny Cash.

Cash’s contribution, per-
formed with U2, is a statement
of purpose for the singer. “The
Wanderer,” with Cash’s black-
as-pit low—end vocals over
U2’s Zooropa keyboard-laden
music, portrays a singer trying
to move through the modern
world with old—time values. He
is still dressed in black in a
world of ultra—violet, but his
strength of character, the
power of his legend, and sheer
force of will and talent allow
him to survive.

Next to Nick Cave, Johnny
Cash, and their little brother
Simon Bonney, the rest of this
album is nearly powerless.
Lou Reed, in my mind, died
with Warhol, but deserves no
museum. Laurie Anderson was
a good idea, but doesn’t do
much for overall content, and
the House of Love are slightly
out of place. Perhaps next
time, Wenders will let Nick
Cave direct the soundtrack
project, and Wim can sit in a
sunroom with Mikhail
Gorbachev and soak up gin.

Columnist

ment for retir-
Keith Pompey ing men’s

head track and
ﬁeld coach John Vasvary.

He doesn’t have to look too
far. The number one candidate
might be right underneath his
nose.

Steve Lewis, the head coach
of the women’s program and the
men’s sprint and hurdlers coach,
should;be.named.head.coach of
the entire track program.

With the current trend of hav-
ing one coach in charge of entire
track and ﬁeld pr05.r...aIns,“'lLewis
is an obvious choice. His record
speaks for itself.

During his tenure at Pitt, he
has produced over 70 Big East
champions, 13 individual All-
Americans, several additional
All-American relay squads, as
well as two world-record hold-
ers.

A person with these creden-
tials should have any coaching
position locked up. But accord-
ing to Pitt’s athletic department,
the decision isn’t that easy.

“We haven’t decided exactly
what direction we will take,”
Jaynes said. “There are pro-
grams around the country that
are organized [with one coach
for both teams] that way. That is:
certainly an option we would
consider after [the end of the
season].”

What is there to consider?
Due to the lack of comraderie
between the male sprinters and
distance runners on the team,
Lewis is the right man for the
job.

For instance, during the
Indoor Big East Championship
back in February, Lewis con-
ducted a team meeting which
included the male distance run-
ners, and the next day the
Panthers performed with zeal.

After a lackluster performance
the day before, distance runner
Frank Nesko gritted out a third-
place ﬁnish in the mile.

In recent weeks, after the Pitt
men won their second Big East
outdoor crown, assistant coach
Jim Lear credited Lewis for

The Pitt baseball team and
its season of firsts heads into
Bristol, Connecticut today
looking to continue blazing
new frontiers.

The top-seeded Panthers roll
into their first ever Big East
tournament touting their
best record ever (31-14-1) and
their first Big East regular-sea-
son title. Pitt opened the four-
team double-elimination tour-
nament against Connecticut
yesterday.

The game was suspended
with Connecticut batting in the
top of the fourth inning as Pitt
led 3-0. The Panthers jumped
all over the Huskies in the bot-
tom of the first when Tyler
Shantz smacked a two-run
homer. Craig Crawley capped
off the scoring in the bottom of
the second when he hit an RBI
single.

Pitcher Tedde Campbell
allowed only two hits through
the first three innings. The

4 x 100 relay sets school record 1‘

“We had an opportunity for

late-entree qualification to the
ECACs,” track coach Steve
Lewis said. “We also had an
opportunity to qualify kids
who already qualified for
IC4As to possibly qualify to
the national championships.”

The men’s competition was
highlighted by the 4 x 100
meter relay. The Panther four-
some of Anthony Dorsett,
Brian Whitley, Jerel Williams
and Dietrich Jells teamed up to
set a new school record with a
time of 40.44 seconds.

Although Pitt managed to
break a record they had to set-
tle for second behind West
Virginia’s 40.35, thus making
this week’s IC4A champi-
onship meet their last chance
of qualifying for the NCAAs.

Breaking the 4 x 100 record
isn’t new to the Panthers. Two
weeks ago at the Penn relays
in Philadelphia, the team of
Dorsett, Jones, Williams and
Whitley broke the old school
record (40.60) with a time of
40.53 to win the IC4A section.

“For me the best 4 x 100 we

Tyler’s on-field production
coupled with his 3.4 QPA
earned him a spot on the
GTE Academic All-American
team.

In his four years at Pitt,
Jackson has compiled a 101-

aggressive style of baseball.
The Panthers led the nation
in steals a year ago and set
a Big East record with 88

Lady Panthers’ recruits hope to offset loss of seniors

By David Saliba
For The Pitt News

Following a 21-10 season
and a bid to the National
Women’s Invitational
Tournament, its first since
1981, the Lady Panthers bas-
ketball program will look to
fill a huge void left by four
graduating seniors.

Coach Bruce will depend on
two new recruits to fill the loss
of two “star” players, Jonna
Huemerich and Erin Maloy, as
well as the loss of Jill
Colabrese and Carolyn Miller.

“You can’t replace a Jonna
Huemrich or an Erin Maloy,”
Pitt head coach Kirk Bruce
said.

“There has never been a
player like J onna in the history

Novice-eight! win gold
at Dad Vail Regatta

By Vicki Geubtner
For The Pitt News

The ﬁnal race of the season
for the Pitt men’s novice eight
proved them to be anything but
new to the circumstances. The
boat’s ﬁrst—year rowers, raced
like veterans and won gold for
the first time in Pitt history at
the Dad Vail Regatta this past
weekend.

“We went nuts at the win-
ner’s dock, running and hug-
ging each other,” Mike Rhody,
a member of the boat, said.

It was the first time this sea-
son that the novice boat consist-
ing of Ed Zabela, Cliff Jones,
Todd Shrub, Matt McGowan,
Rob Michaels, Jeff Maurin,
Rhody, Jon Shank and
Coxswain Michele Brodoski
won a medal, let alone the old-
est cup event of the regatta -

the Lev Brett Bowl.

“It was Pitt Crew history
being made,” head coach Joel
Kehm said.

The boat lost to an undefeat-
ed Skidmore College in the
semiﬁnals, but easily shattered
their perfect record in the ﬁnals
by “a boat length-and-a—half
ahead of everyone,” Rhody
said.

“It wasn’t just their boat win-
ning,” women’s coach John
Dougheity said, “It was for the
alumni and for a lot of people
who haven’t had the opportuni-
ty to be in a fast boat.”

The novice eight wasn’t the
only Pitt boat to medal this
weekend. After two successful
races at the Big East and
Middle Atlantic Champion-
ships, the men’s varsity heavy
four were edged out of a gold

\;c-tsvary resigns after twelve

years as Pitt men ’s track coach

By Keith Pompey
Asst. Sport Editor

Twelve years ago John
Vasvary took over as the head
honcho of the University of
Pittsburgh’s men’s track and
field team.

Under Vasvary Pitt track has
reached a new standard of
excellence.

But now after years of bad
health as well as an offer he
can’t pass up, Vasvary is leav-
ing the sport he loves on top.
The Panthers won their second
Big East Outdoor Track and
Field title two weeks ago.

“Winning this year’s title
was special because it was my
last year,” Vasvary said.

Vasvary’s decision to resign
from Pitt’s head coaching
position had plenty to do with
his health and the demands of
the job.

“I had a heart attack and a
four-way bypass a couple of
years ago,” Vasvary said.

“In February of ‘93 I had a
relapse. My doctors would
rather not see me doing what
I am doing seven days a week.
Coming in at five o’clock
in the morning, driving a
van because you are up all
day going with cross country,
indoor track and outdoor
track.

“It became a combination of
[the doctors] and my wife try-

ing to get me off the road.
Then the opportunity back
home in Virginia made it even
tougher.”

The opportunity that
Vasvary is talking about is the
assistant principal and athletic
director position at his former
high school in Lynchburg,
Virginia.

“My real good friend got
named principal and he want-
ed me to come down there and
be his assistant and athletic
director,” Vasvary said. “It is
going to be hard work, but I
will be home at night. I will
sleep in my own bed.

“I’m looking forward to this
being a different challenge.
This will be something differ-
ent than I am used to doing.
Maybe in some ways I can
help the coaches down there.
There will be a different set of
goals. It will be something
totally different than what I
have been doing the last 25
years.”

Vasvary, who has helped
establish a rich track tradition
at Pitt, will change his life
style for good effective at the
end of the 1994 season.

Under Vasvary, Pitt earned
impressive national rankings
in 1984, 1986, 1987 and 1988.
He was also responsible for
Pitt capturing its first Big East
title in 1987 at the indoor
championship. Shortly after

that, in 1989, Pitt won its ﬁrst
outdoor crown.

To those close to the
Lynchburg native, one would
know that his success did not
start at Pitt. He made a coach-
ing name for himself on the
high school level. As head
coach at various schools in
Virginia, Vasvary recorded an
unheard of .925 winning per-
centage. Vasvary also spear-
headed 74 state championships
and runner-ups, with four of
his athletes earning national
rankings.

These high school national
rankings take a back seat to
the world class caliber athletes
he has had at Pitt throughout
the years.

During his rookie year at
Pitt, his team earned five All-
American honors and a young-
ster by the name of Roger
Kingdom won the national
title in the 110 meter hurdlers.
Little did Vasvary know
Kingdom would go on to be a
two-time Olympic gold medal-
ist as well as the current
American record holder in that
event.

In two weeks Vasvary will
hang up his stop watch so to
speak. All he will have is
memories of the Kingdoms,
Lee Mcraes Eric Cannons and
Keith Dowlings that helped
mold his Panthers into the
national spotlight.

But with the bases loaded,
Crawley hit a single to

John Whiteford said, alluding to
the novice eight’s victory just
two hours before their race.

Kehm said he believed the
heavy four had not been chal-

more experienced crew who
had a better finishing sprint.”
He summed up the race as “a

not as successful as the men this
