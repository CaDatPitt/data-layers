“Mrs. Holland Assumes
New Role as “Liaison”

-For Area H.S. Seniors  

(Sec E(litm'ial Page Two)

From her office in Roomi227 of the Pittsburgh Board
of Education Building, Mrs». Francis Holland, former assis-
tant dean of women for Student Affairs, takes care of job
placement and scholarship applications for thousands of
Pittsburgh. high school seniors.

In her new position as director of Vocational Place-
ment, Department of Public Services of the Pittsburgh"
Board of Education, Mrs. Holland serves as “liaison agent”
between the public schools, business and higher education.

She advises employers on the
skills and potentialities of high
school graduates and finds good
usefor both company and col-
lege. scholarship funds.

“Job placement is relatively
easy today,” said Mrs. Holland,
“especially with jobs so plentiful.
When I first graduated from ‘the

ears I was assistant dean of
women at.Pitt in charge of hous-
ing ‘and ' employment. Some"of
the girls had to work for $75 a
month. This is hardly the case
today.” i

A small ray of ,hope
aroused by a recent report
that the University would
soon become state-related,
would appear to be destroy-
ed by the statements of
State Senator Robert D. Flem-
ing, chairman of the Senate Ap-
propriations Committee. In an
exclusive interview, Fleming in-
sisted that Governor William
Scranton’s report that a “general
agreement” had been reached
among legislative leaders to pass
the necessary appropriation bills
to make Pitt state-related was
“absolutely unconﬁrmed.”

This report, printed in the.

Pittsburgh Press, stated that
Fleming and Rep. Martin Mullen,
chairman of the House Appropri-
ations Committee, had worked

out the agreement in a series of ,

conversations. But, Fleming said
that the House and Senate were
no closer to an agreement on
state-relatedness or the general
appropriations bill than they
were two weeks ago when the
legislature recessed for a holiday
break. A

The senator remarked that he
had been trying to establish a
special conference committee to

break the present deadlock over '

the general appropriations bill.
The impasse with this bill -has
held up consideration of the Uni-

p_lans'for this- event. . '

  Editorial. A

The resignation of Dean Frances Hol-
Qland means the loss of a unique link, the
 bridge between the institution and the stu-
I dent it educates.
-2 One can easily wonder why the depar-
' ture of an assistant dean of women can be
that important to the Universit.‘/- Few
would claim she was a Bowman with plans
for a great building or a Litchﬁeld with a
vision for a multiuniversity. But when stu-
dents talked she listened and listened with
an intense and perceivable concern.

Beginning on the Dean of Women staff
in 1935, her career was in_terrupted by mar-
riage and the raising of four child1'en. When
she returned to the staff in 1962, ,she came
equipped with the invaluable experience of
having children of her own, two of whom
are in college.

A gracious and attractive women, she
had a miraculous ability to put anyone at
ease in the most tense social situation. Stu-
dents quickly recognized her as a person
with a genuine "concern for their lives.
I Those who came to no other administrator
talked freely with Mrs. Holland.

A tacit but meaningful tribute was paid
to her duringethe last Student Government
(SS) election. She was SG advisor and can-
didates and -workers from all three camps

meaningful advice. To this day students
who know her well have no idea whom she
favored.

It was her closeness and unique rapport

It was also inevitable that a person of her
talent and training moved into a position of
greater responsibility. Well on her way to
her Ph.D. in educational administration, she
brought the education world’s most advance_-

While the administration deserves com-
