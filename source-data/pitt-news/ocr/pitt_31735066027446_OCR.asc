Researchers discuss
AIDS medication

New treatment reduces HIV levels

:_Matt Stock

Although AIDS remains an incurable and fatal disease,
new therapies may make it a manageable illness.
Recent data presented by top AIDS researchers from Pitt

 
 
  

”Esc|Iew obfuscation.”

 

   
 
    
 

and Johns Hopkins University show that new medication
combinations have been able to reduce HIV to an undetectable
level in AIDS patients, a previously unheard of phenomenon.

On Thursday, the Holiday Irm at University Center host-
ed the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center’s fourth arma-
al Anti—retroviral Update. Three AIDS specialists, fresh from
the national conference in Washington D.C., came to report
the latest ﬁndings in AIDS treatment.

The evening’s first speaker was Dr. John Mellors, an asso-
ciate professor from Pitt’s School of Medicine and the direc-
tor of the newly formed Pitt Treatment Evaluation Unit.

‘This is a very exciting time in the history of the HIV epi-
demic,” Mellors said, “but the excitement really has to be tem-
pered by the realization that the AIDS epidemic is still out of
control.”

According to Mellors, the primary question asked of him
and his colleagues is whether or not the goal of HIV eradica-
tion is closer to being a reality.

“We don’t know the answer to that question,” Mellors
said, “but for individuals who have never been treated before
who are either in the acute phase of HIV infection, or are in
the chronic established phase of HIV infection, certain triple

GSO says looming cuts threaten undergraduate education

Graduate students presented concerns
about the negative etfects of possible cuts in
PhD programs on undergraduate education
and the need for University-wide realloca-
tions to the committee helping decide the fate
of some departments.

Though it is too early to learn the impact
of the meeting, representatives of the
Graduate Student Organization that spoke to
the committee Thursday night said they were
pleased with the way their presentation went.

“'The committee was attentive, and took
notes, and asked good questions, and seemed
interested in what we had to say,” said GSO
co-president John Ernsthausen.

The GSO asked Kathleen DeWalt, the
associate dean for graduate studies, for input

into the process after its January meeting,
when members of the Planning and Budget
Committee informed them that the procedure
was going to be jump-started.

“It’s okay to change, but when you
change, make sure everyone’s informed,”
Ernsthausen said.

The presentation was made by
Emsthausen, a grad student in math, a “qual-
ity core” department; Dan Schoos from clas-
sics, a department “to be reduced;” and
Debra Boyle from philosophy, a department
which has “demonstrated excellence.” It
included the reading of a memo chatted by
the GSO that addressed concerns about the
future of graduate programs and the vision
driving the process.

“[Boyle is] a graduate student in the phi-
losophy department, which is one of the pre-
mier programs at the University,” said

Schoos. “I thought that it was good that the
committee heard the letter from her 
because it showed that this is not just the con-
cern of the departments under fire  but it’s a
concern of all graduate students.”

The need for vision

A 20-minute question and answer ses-
sion followed the presentation. The commit-
tee and the GSO delved into issues in the let-
ter, especially concerns about criteria being
used to assess departments.

“We tried to make it clear  that the
graduate. students were confused about the
criteria, that we really didn’t know, and that as
a result of this, there was a- lot of frustration
and suspicion about the process,” Schoos
said. “So the committee, of course, was con-
cerned about this.”

Ernsthausen said the committee asked if

the GSO had ideas about what criteria should
be used and that the representatives would
speak to other GSO members in a meeting
this Thursday and clarify their ideas in anoth-
er letter to the committee. The committee also
asked if employability after graduation
should be a criteria for examination.

According to Emsthausen, the GSO will
also discuss how grad students feel about cut-
ting programs perceived as weak to support
programs said to be strong.

When asked in the meeting, Schoos said
the representatives pointed to two points of
their letter.

“We wholeheartedly support changes
that lead to improvements and which are
implemented with both a clear vision of the
future of the University and input from all
affected parties,” the GSO said in its memo to

Around the World

JOHANNESBURG, South Africa —
Recently, a South African surgeon was
arrested on drug possession charges.
Dr. Wouter Basson, 46, was arrested for
possessing, 1,000 tablets of the drug
Ecstasy. During his hearing last week, it
was revealed that one of the country’s
chemical warfare units, the army’s 7th
Medical Battalion, was shut down
shortly before Nelson Mandela was
elected in 1994. A secret 1992 report
states that the unit would provide poi-
sons for agents to use against those who
were ﬁghting against the apartheid sys-
tem. The poisons could be’ put into
drinks or clothing. According to the
report, the unit also supplied bombs
used to attack neighboring countries.

ANCHORAGE, Alaska — Exxon has
begun its appeal of the $5.3 billion
judgement for the 1989 Exxon Valdiz
oil spill. The company has ﬁled

papers that ask a federal appeals court
to review a judge’s acceptance of the
jury award in 1994, which has already
accrued $38 million in interest. The
appeal questions how the judge calcu-
lated his approval of the award and says
that he gave objectionable instructions
to the jury. If damages are awarded and
paid, they will be split among about
10,000 fisherman and 4,000 other
plaintiffs, including natives, businesses,

Award.

Cohen steps into the role of
Professor Puzzle through his two-
year-old creation, The Puzzle Play
Program. He visits classrooms once
a month, demonstrating puzzles like
the 3-D ring described earlier or
other written puzzles and games
that apply mathematical processes.

This idea came from a 1940 Arts
and Sciences alumnus, Leonard
Messer, who approached Cohen
with the idea that resulted in the
Puzzle Play Program.

“It’s such a quick world,”
Cohen says. “Everyone thinks
you’vc got to learn quick, and the
love of math and science falls into
that. We counteract that by working
on puzzles in schools.”

And Puzzle Play, as stated in
Cohen’s teacher manual, empha-
sizes the word “play” so fourth
through sixth—grade kids keep an
interest in math and science.

Children write letters to
Professor Puzzle after several
Puzzle Play Days with comments or
questions. He gives a light chuckle
as he points to a scrawled note from
a child who describes a puzzle she
solved as “really cool.”

Cohen explained, as he opened a
blue expanding folder, that he was
chosen because of the planning and
success of the program.

He also pulled out an endow-
ment document and envelopes from
another folder. His goal is
$950,000, which includes a person-
al donation from Cohen of $5,000 a
year

For the program to expand and
continue, Cohen said more money is
needed for texts and supplies.

Cohen said he also needs stu-
dent interns and volunteers.

The Puzzle Play Internship is
offered every term and listed in the
CAS Course Description booklet
under “Math Internships, 1900.” It
is worth from one to three credits
and the only prerequisites listed for
the internship are “interest, sinceri-
ty, and integrity.”

Cohen, raising his eyebrows
with a hint of hope, said that inter-
ested students can come directly to
him in 304 Thackeray Hall to sign
up.

“I would like to encourage stu-
dents now to go beyond education
-— to make a difference,” said
Cohen.

Pitt-Bradford professor
researches internet addiction

 

Just one more cigarette. Just one more
drink Just one more hit. Just one more link?
For some, travelling the Information
Superhighway may be more of a need than
a pleasure. Recent evidence has shown that
on-line abuse falls under the same clinical
classiﬁcation as substance addiction.

Kimberly Young, a clinical psycholo-
gist and assistant professor of psychology at
Pitt’s Bradford campus, is conducting
unprecedented research on the latest phe-
nomenon in the Infonnation Age: on-line
addiction.

Though she cites her research as
“exploratory and qualitative in nature,”
Young has attracted national attention for
her efforts to classify this rapidly growing
problem as a clinical impairment. .

Young said the psychological need to
spend time on the intemet is similar to an
alcoholic needing another drink or a smoker
experiencing a nicotine lit. The criteria for
determining clinical intemet addiction
closely resembles that for substances.

“I have modiﬁed this study so that the
internet is substituted for substances,” said
Young.

Young’s study focuses onpeoplelwho
spend an excessive amount of time using
interactive on-line applications including
chat rooms and multi—user dungeons, which
are intemet enclaves allowing people to
receive live feedback from one another.

As part of her study, Young released a
survey in an on-line interactive forum. Over
400 responses poured in from people who
claimed to spend too much time on-line.

The Autumn issue of the University of
Pittsburgh’s Research Review indicated
nearly 80 percent of the respondents ﬁt
Young’s deﬁnition of an addict. On average,
addicts spent 40 to 50 hours a week engaged
in some type of interactive intemet function

 

and suffered from diﬁerent levels of depen-
dence. ‘

Her research follows the criteria estab-
lishing addiction guidelines dictated in the
American Psychiatric Association’s’
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders.

Young said symptoms include such
behaviors as staying on-line longer than
intended, developing a tolerance so that
more time must be spent on-line to achieve
a level of satisfaction, and experiencing
withdrawal symptoms otf-line. _

Young stated that college students are
one of the most vulnerable groups becoming
addicted to the intemet.

“They are often experiencing the ﬁrst
independence from their parents and many
times have difficulty acclimating to campus
life,” she said. “The intemet provides an out-
let for meeting people and hanging out.”

The problem with this type of social
interaction, according to Young, is that it
often encourages personality distortion as
well as isolation.

“The internet allows one to alter his or
her persona A shy person loses their inhibi-
tions and is easily able to express his or her-
self in ways that would seem too risky for
face-to-face communication,” says Young.

Young said people can become addict-
ed to the attention they are able to attract
with their false identities, allowing the inter-
net to consume more of their time and ener-
gy.

Young also considers calling in sick to
work, skipping school, and giving up recre-
ational and social activities to spend time on
the intemet signs of addiction.

As more researchers become involved
with the issue, Young remains a pioneer of
the study. She is planning to publish the ﬁrst
book on intemet addiction next winter.

Her overall prognosis for the problem is
bleak: “This is extremely serious,” she said.
“The snowball is just beginning.”

the committee.

The letter also said, “Perhaps some of
the problems facing FAS require a re-exarni—
nation of spending priorities at a higher level,
i.e., perhaps it is die status quo of the
University-wide priorities that must be
changed.”

Schoos added that graduate students are
concemed that they are still waiting for Pitt’s
vision to be deﬁned.

“Vision is about priorities and where you
see, fimdamentally, what this University
should be like, and that has to come from
higher up,” Schoos said. “I guess we’re still
waiting to be told what that is.”

Ina previous letter to the provost, the
GSO expressed concern that the administra-
tion “regards a nationally-ranked athletic
department as central to its mission (despite

 

FROM PAGE I 

the millions this non—acadernic pursuit loses
armually)” and is considering eliminating
graduate programs.

Provost James Maher and Chancellor
Mark Nordenberg have both said that the ath-
letic department is taking steps to eliminate
its “considerable” debt and improve its qual-
ity, but that debt has prompted the GSO and
others to look at it as an area for reallocations.

"Ihere are other opportunities, possible »

opportunities, at the school level,”
Emsthausen said.

The committee reviewing faculty of Arts
and Sciences departments has no power to
recommend University-wide reallocations,

but must focus on the FAS.

the presence of the virus to undetectable
levels in the bloodstream and in genital
tract secretions.

Mellors was speaking of protease

“ inhibitors, drugs that have had some
‘ success when used alone in decreasing

the HIV virus load in patients.

Mellors noted that recent research
groups had been treated with combina-
tions of either two or three protease
inhibitors with astonishing results. He
showed several charts containing new
data from these experiments that sur-
prised the crowd.

The charts showed a drastic
decrease in viral load in the bloodstream
and an increase in CD4 cells vital to the
continuing health‘ of AIDS patients.
Though this is not a cure for the disease,
it stops it in the HIV stage and keeps it at
that level through continued medication,
thus preventing the onset of full-blown
AIDS. These low levels may also reduce
contagion rates.

Mellors stressed to the audience that
they should not be overly excited about
the latest ﬁndings.

“If you look at the toll that HIV will
exact on humankind, and you look at the
war as an overview, we are making very
minor victories in a war that is being
lost,” Mellors said.

After Mellors ﬁnished, he turned
the podium over to Dr. John G. Bartlett,
a medical professor and chief of the
Division of Infectious Disease at the
Johns Hopkins University School of

l’itt’s College of Brrsiness

Medicine. He reiterated Mellors’ plea
for tempered enthusiasm concerning the
protease inhibitors.

“This is a time when there is an
explosive epidemic  the probability of
a cure with the current weapomy is very
small,” he said. “But it’s still a wonder-
ful, wonderful time for those of us who
work in HIV clinics in terms of what we
are able to do in 1997.”

After presenting more concurrent
data from research studies of trial med-
ications, Bartlett gave the ﬂoor to Dr.
Glenn J. Treisman, an associate profes-
sor from the Johns Hopkins University
School of Medicine department of psy-
chiatry. Treisman also serves as the
school’s director of AIDS Psychiatry
Services.

Treisman came to the conference to
bring the public’s attention to the high
incidence of mental illness in AIDS
patients. He also spoke about the suc-
cess that he and his colleagues have had
in treating these mental illnesses.

“Psychiatric disorders are enriched
in the HIV clinic. That’s my thesis for
tonight,” he said, explaining. why he
believes mental illness is prevalent
among AIDS patients.

“I think that HIV increases the risk
for psychiatric illness,” Treisman con-
tinued. “HIV damages your brain. It
causes major depression. It causes a
variety of psychological problems. It is a
problem that demoralizes people, sepa-
rates them from their family and their

friends, and is stigmatized.”

Treisman sees mental illness as a
serious and often overlooked aspect of
AIDS, thinking that the two work in a
vicious cycle. »

“Psychiatric illnesses increase the
risk for HIV,” Treisman said.
“Depression, substance abuse, addic-
tion, personality disorder, and the psy-
chological stigma associated with the
HIV epidemic of being grouped, proba-
bly increase your risk for HIV. If you’re
hopeless about the future, you’re not
likely to take care of yourself.”

Treisman said that this cycle of
behavior not only causes initial HIV
infection in individuals, but also leads
infected individuals to practice behav-
iors that spread HIV. If this behavior can
be controlled through therapy and minor
medications, then Treisman feels that
AIDS patients will be more apt to take
care of themselves and check into clin-
ics, rather than remaining on the streets
and spreading the virus.

“Screening people for mental health
is not offensive, even if I do it,”
Treisman quipped. “It’s good for
patients. They know you care about
them.” .

This sense of caring, according to
Treisman, is what keeps the patients
coming back for treatments. .

“If you ask patients mental health
‘questions, they don’t resent it, they come
[to the clinic] more.”

The GSO representatives also empha-
sized to the committee the role of graduate
students in undergraduate education.

“We felt that it was important to stress to
the committee that we thought at [Pitt] there
were deep and complex linkages between
the undergraduate education experience and
graduate education and research,” Schoos
said. “We had a fundamental disagreement
with the notion that you could somehow
slice away a graduate program and not have
that adversely alfect undergraduate educa-
tion.”

Schoos said the committee asked if they
meant to imply students couldn’t get good
undergraduate education without grad stu-
dents.

“I don’t think we meant to imply that,”
Schoos said “A small liberal arts college
tends to have smaller classes, where profes-
sors have the opportunity to provide closer
supervision. At [Pitt], many classes are large
lecture classes  and in this sort of structure
the undergraduate and graduate programs
seem much more intertwined. The graduate
students add a great deal to the undergradu-
ate experience.”

Ernsthausen said that graduate students
make important role models for undergradu-
ates

“Role models demonstrate to under-
graduate students the importance to the
teacherofthematerialtheyarestudyingin
their classes,” Emstahusen said “It gives the
subject’s validity to the undergraduate, as he
sees this role model talking about how this

Recent data presented by top
AIDS researchers from Pitt and
Johns Hopkins University shows
that new medication combinations
have been effective in the treat-
ment of HIV. It is a large step in the
right direction for individuals
infected with HIV, but still a long
way away from a cure.

The University of A Pittsburgh
Medical Center’s fourth annual
Anti—retroviral Update was held at
the Holiday Inn at University
Center. The exciting news that cer-
tain combinations of protease

THE PITT NEWS

inhibitors can reduce the presence
of HIV in infected individuals to a
nearly undetectable level was
announced. The drug combination
drastically improves the chances of
continuing health in people infect-
ed with HIV. It stops the virus in
the HIV stage and prevents the
onset of full-blown AIDS.

However, this discovery is not
a cure. It will not stop the spread of
HIV, and we still have an epidemic
on our hands.

The only way to prevent AIDS
is not to get it. The only way to

protect yourself is to practice safe
sex.

First of» all, if you are not
mature enough to purchase con-

doms and to either use them or .

make sure that your partner uses
them, then, you are not mature or
responsible enough to have sex. As
the saying goes, “A few moments
of pleasure ain’t worth dying for.”
Most of us wouldn’t hold a loaded
gun to our heads and engage in a
game of Russian Roulette. Having
unprotected sex isn’t any smarter
than pulling the trigger on a Smith

Theonly cure for AIDS is not to  it - protect yourself A

and Wesson pointed at your tem-
ple. -
Secondly, as oral sex still
involves the exchange of bodily
ﬂuids, it isn’t safe either. If anyone
told you that it is, you should rec-
ommend that he or she have an
AIDS test.

So, be smart. Protect yourself.
Don’t get AIDS, and you won’t
have to worry about a cure.
Congratulations to the researchers
for their great discovery. It ain’t an
end to the war against AIDS, but it
is a step in the right direction.

Let's go south and commune-with nature

 

A few weeks before spring break I always get
this itchy urge to leave Oakland. The months of
January and February are the longest unintenupted
stint of consecutive classes. Being stuck in school
this long, being stuck in Oakland this long, being
stuck in this Arctic anomaly of Pittsburgh weather
leaves me longing for clean, wann, outdoor air.
Perhaps I have a little cabin fever.

. Around this time, the garbage—infested,
methane-producing atmosphere of South Oakland
begins to wear thin on one’s nerves. The facts that I
don’t own a car and am morally» opposed to taking
Greyhound anywhere don’t leave me too many
options. I think the best medicine for me and for the
rest of us who are suffering from the dreadful “I’m
stuck in Oakland forever!” disease is to go camping,
somewhere South.

Camping is probably my favorite thing to do. I
can sleep late. I can go hiking and enjoy the fresh air.
I can have a campﬁre (the secret love of all closet
pyromaniacs). Most importantly, I can sit and think,
uninterrupted. No classes, no buildings, no semi-
breathable air, no horrible city tap water, no home-
work, no people being arrested in front of my house.
All these things contribute to a more peaceful state
of mind. '

Another option is to go camping with good
friends, which is often a necessity if you don’t own
a car. Camping is a great way to enjoy each other’s
company without having to wony about what time
you have class tomorrow or “Sony, I can’t talk right
now. I have work to do.” With camping, ﬁiends are
each other’s captive audience.

Sometimes though, it is not always possible to
get transportation to the camping resort of your
dreams. The best remedy for this ailment is to play
the pretend game. Invite some friends over. Clear
your living room of all its furniture. Next, set up a
tent in the middle of the room. Take some green see-
through plastic and cover the lights with it (not too
close or the pretend game will turn into a giant bon-
ﬁre). Play “’Ihe lion sleeps tonight” on the stereo and
roast marshmallows over the gas stove. My father
used to tell me to roast them over a ﬂashlight; I gave
up after the third day of waiting.

Some advice for those who do go camping over
spring break. First, there is no such thing as a snipe.

 

If someone asks you to catch one, tell them to draw -

you a picture. Second, there is no such thing as a left-
handed-smoke-shifter. If someone asks you to bor-
row one from the neighboring campers, don’t. What

I like to do is disappear for a half—hour and make a g

contraption/thing-a-rna-bob out of tin cans and vari-
ous other things which are stuck in the car. Then, I
come back with a smile on my face and say, “Sony,
all they had was a right-handed one.” It usually gets
a good laugh. Be creative.

Here are a list of things that are fun to do when
you go camping. First are the standards: canoeing,
rafting, hiking, ﬁshing, swimming, etc. These are all
a great deal of fun,but there area few other things to
do. Gambling and drinking (for those over 21 only,
of course) are a great way to spend an evening with
nothing better to do. Good friends, a deck of cards,
good beer, and clean fresh air, who could ask for

‘anything more? (Toyota perhaps.) If you are

opposed to gambling, use poker chips. While it may
seem a bit childish, I doubt I can ﬁnd anyone in col-
lege who wouldn’t like a good night game of hide
and seek, capture the ﬂag, or ﬂashlight tag. And
besides, I wouldn’t put anything past drunken col-
lege students. For those of us who have been known
to play football on the Cathedral lawn at two in the
morning, these games don’t seem like much of a
stretch.

But seriously, what I like most about camping
are the hikes I take alone. Solitude in a beautiful
woodland setting is extremely cahning. If any of you
go camping with friends this spring break, I urge you
to take some time to appreciate our vanishing nature.
Take time to marvel at the beauty of things that are
not man made. Mankind has done some amazing
things in history, but it has not and probably wﬂl
never surpass the amazing accomplishments of time
and evolution. It helps one realize how small and
insigniﬁcant man is in the history and vast expanse
of the universe. Pay particular attention to the stars.
With the light pollution and dismal weather, it is hard
to see many around here, but out in the country they
are amazing.

I know most of you do not share my fascination
with roughing it, but anyone can rent a cabin and do
the same thing. It is truly worth it. It makes us appre-
ciate the convenience of the technological innova-
tions that pervade our city life.

Jay DeMar1ino wishes that he still had the time to go
camping once a month.

Pitt’s not alone in this; there is a

Tuesday, February ‘I8, 1997

culus courses which use calculators

Calculus: It’s more than just a dirty word

 

Everybody should know some
basic calculus. It’s not a dirty word,
and you don’t have to be a geek to
understand it. Calculus is the most
basic of the advanced mathematics,
and advanced mathematics is one of
those great subjects which actually
forces a student to think. And what
greater cause is there for a liberal arts
university than to get people to
think? Now, everybody knows the
world is full of stupid people, but I
have yet to meet anybody who is so
stupid that they are incapable of
understanding the basics of calculus,
if they aretaught correctly. Ay, there
lies the rub. '

But before I start to talk about
how Pitt teaches math, I need to
acknowledge where the root of the
problem lies: in elementary schools.
By the time students get to high
school, most have already decided
that they either like or hate math, and
that they are either good or bad at it.
If a student hates math or thinks that
he’s bad at it, this becomes math pho-
bia. He does whatever he can to avoid
it. A friend of mine who is a graduate
math student and teaching assistant
told me about his theory that, some-

screwed up: They don’t learn how to
do long division or to add fractions
correctly and it slows their progress,
and they never recover. These are
important skills which can beused to
balance checkbooks and figure out
how long it will take to pay off a
credit card bill. However, instead of
reinforcing these skills in students,
the new ways of teaching math try to
circumvent the problem, and I think
that does more damage than good.
These basic skills should not be
avoided. They should be practiced

V more. They should be reinforced in

the core math‘ classes, and» they
should be reinforced in every major.
Many students don’t see how math
can apply to their field of study. Well,
it can be applied, and we need to
show them how. Perhaps we need to
implement M—designated courses,
analogous to the W-designated writ-
ing courses, which show a student
how math applies to them and which
reinforces the skills that everybody
needs to know. - ‘
Now, Pitt has tried to place some
standards on mathematical reasoning
abilities, but they’re not enforcing it.
In fact, they’re avoiding those skills
and teaching computer (or, in some
cases, calculator) courses instead.

widespread movement to implement
computers into the math curriculum,
which, in itself, is good, I think.
Computersand calculators are great
tools, but they shouldn’t be used to
replace thinking. I’m afraid that
implementing them to circumvent the
learning of menial calculations actu-

— ally retards the learning process.

I have had a couple of friends
approach me to help them out with
their algebra homework. Being a
math major, and believing that I have
this stuff down, I immediately
replied, “Sure.” Then, I look at the
homework and have to hand it back
saying, “Sorry, but I don’t know how
to use your calculator.” They weren’t
even problems that could be done by
hand, which is the way I learned it,
because the homework didn’t ask for
the correct answer, but rather for the
calculator_’s answer which would be a
mere approximation that couldn’t be
predicted. Now, not wanting to dis-
miss my friend’s pleas for help, I sat
down and tried to figure out the cal-
culator, and I have to say that doing it
by hand is far easier. And not only
that, but I can come up with an exact
answer when the calculator cannot.

I have heard (mostly second-
hand) stories of students’ woes in cal-

to circumvent almost all manual cal-
culations. One girl, a very bright
astronomy student, said to my friend
that she felt shortchanged by the
computer-calculus course, because
she believed that there was some
interesting mathematics going on
inside the microprocessor that she
didn’t get to see.

She was right! Calculus contains
some very interesting ideas, and
mathematics, and it is quite beautiful.
Seriously! Math is one of those few
subjects which can be done entirely
in the mind (which is why I claim
that it’s a humanity and not a sci-
ence!), it can make a person think,
and it can expand his mind and his
horizons.

Gee, I think that’s just what a lib-

eral arts education is supposed to
make people do! If Pitt could make
just one change to its curriculum
which would boost its ranking among
colleges and universities, and which
would give a Pitt diploma a much
greater market value, it would be to
teach everybody more math. Real
math.
Kris Kissel considers math to be
much more fun and interesting than
the prom queens from his last col-
umn. Sorry, ladies.

Don '1‘ trust the libraries: they lie to you and take your money

 

Don’t trust the University Library
System. It’s just that simple. T‘hey’ll lie to
you and try to make you pay for their
incompetence.

Now, I don’t much believe in pouring
out personal sob stories, but when they
might prevent others from being caught in
the same lurch, I’ll share my tales.

As part of putting together a piece on
banned books for The Pitt News, I went to
the law library for a particular work listing
books which had been barmed.

When Ichecked out the book, no one
gave me any hassle or any warnings. If I had
only known then what I know now.

It turned out that the book, entitled
“Banned in the USA,” didn’t really have
what I was looking for, so the next day, I
took it over to Hillman Library with some
other books I was returning.

Before I turned the book over to them,
I asked:

‘This is ﬁorn the law library. Can I
return it here, or should I walk it over to
them?”

“No, we can send it back; no problem.”

“No problem.” Those should have been
thewordsthatmademegrabthebookand
run over to the law library to return it myself.

But, I, in good faith and blind trust of

my friendly neighborhood University
Library System, left it with them.

That was well before it was overdue —
back in October. Well, time went on, and I
got a call from home.

“Son, there’s an envelope here from
Pitt. Should I open it?”

Most of my family is good that way.
They don’t open my mail or go through my
private papers without my express permis-
sion, often in writing.

“It’s an overdue notice from the law
library.”

After hearing the title of the book, I
thought that there was just some delay in
moving from one library to the other, and
didn’t give it much thought.

This month, I received a bunch of mail
forwarded from home. It contained another
overdue notice ﬁorn the law library. So, I
walkedovertoHillmantoaskwhathap—
pened. '

They ran a stack search and, lo and
behold, they found the book. The woman at
the desk gave me her name and number and
told me to take the book to the law library
and have them call her to see about having
the debt forgiven.

The people at the law library said,
“Well, there’s no one here who can forgive a
ﬁne, you'll have to call Cathy tomonow and
explain the situation to her.”

Now, at this point, folks are probably

wondering, “Why?” Why did Hillman
abandon me and abuse my trust? Well, they
said they were unable to discharge it
becausetherewasnobarcodelabelonthe
book. The fact of the matter". no one looked
on the back cover of the book They looked
at the ﬁont cover only. The bar code was on
the back.

If there was no bar code, how did I
check it out? Someone could have dug a lit-
tle deeper and ﬂipped over the book, don’t
you think?

Well, I called Cathy at the law library
the next day. She told me that she couldn’t
forgive a ﬁne of that size, so I’d have to talk
to Mark Silverman.

He told me that Hillman never should
have said that they could accept the book,
because the two libraries are not directly
related. He also said that someone at the law
library ought to have warned me to return
the book directly to them, but that I probably
looked enough like a law student that who-
ever processed the book didn’t think to men-
tion it to me.

The deal Silvennan olfered me was that
if I could get a note ﬁorn the woman who
did the stack search, he would halve my
ﬁne. He asked me if I thought that was fair,
and I said no, that it was Hillman’s fault.
Instead, I told him that the law library ought
to ﬁne Hillman library for being unable to
ﬂip over a book and discharge it, or maybe

for trying to horde the law 1ibrary’s materi-
als.

Silvennan explained that I ought to
have checked into it on the ﬁrst notice, and
that because the book was unavailable for
other patrons some ﬁne ought to be exacted.

It would be somewhat petulant to say,
“Show me the multitude of requests that
were made for. that particular book.” I
understand that the book was effectively out
of circulation. Yet, at the same time, it was
Hillman Library who took the book out of
circulation, not me._I tried to give it back. If
they had a problem, then they ought to have
told me to return it directly to the law library.

Although I could complain about all the

various facets of the library system involved
in this case, I’d rather just warn students not
to trust the library system. Try to use all
materials within the conﬁnes of the library
walls. If you must bonow anything, then
return the books you bonow exactly to the
library you get them from and no other.
Don’t try to renew by telephone —— they
won’t even provide this service over the
weekends when we’re most likely to need it
— take it in before the deadline. Finally,
don’t accept any deals. You’ll only end up
paying for their incompetence.

THE PITT NEWS

There's something funny

about all this technology

 

Technology. What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing. Okay, bad joke, but
an important topic. According to the
media and all of the ads by the major
intemet providers and computer compa-
nies on television, we are living’ in a
glorious age where technological
advances are making the world a better
place to live every day. Is this true? Not
entirely.

Please don’t think that I am a
technophobe. I enjoy new technology
just like everyone else, particularly the
intemet. But for all of the good things
that have resulted from our movement
into the Information Age, there -have
been a number of unfortunate side
effects that I think we would be foolish
to ignore. In addition to being a forum
for ideas, the intemet has also become a
lair where people can freely distribute
X—Files—type conspiracy theories and
hate groups can disseminate their lies to

people who might not know better.

Also, the intemet is not about inforrna—
tion. It is about marketing. In 1996,
some 40,000 companies had web sites
on the intemet, and that number has
been increasing exponentially.
Technology can be a great gift, but it
can be a curse as well.

Last December, I was fascinated by
an article in USA Today by economist
Paul Krugman, whose writings have
greatly inﬂuenced my thinking.
Krugman mocked the conventional wis-
dom that we are living in an age of
amazing progress by pointing out that
technology has not lived up to its
promises. Krugman noted that, accord-
ing to the ﬁlm 2001, in just four more
years technology will enable us to take
trips into space, and there would be
“computers smart enough to go on a
postal-worker-style rampage when they
feel unappreciated.” Krugman went on
to observe another example of how
computers haven’t lived up to their
hype: in 1958, a noted computer pio-
neer claimed that by the year 1970, a
computer would be the world chess
champion. That has yet to happen, and I
doubt that it will any time in the future.
If a computer specifically designed to
play chess cannot outwit a human, then
how can it solve the problems of the
world?

. Speaker of the House Newt
Gingrich is a well known technophile
who sees technology as the answer to
many of our problems. Gingrich is an
admirer of the works of Alvin Tofﬂer, a
futurist who believes that the world is
moving from an industry-based society
into an information-based society.

Gingrich frequently invokes Tofﬂer’s
pro—technology, pro—decentralization
themes in his speeches (but he does
neglect to mention that Tofﬂer has criti-
cized the Republicans for not trying to
shield the less fortunate from the nega-
tive effects of the information age). For
example, in 1995, Gingrich went before
the House Ways and Means Cormnittee,
and during his testimony on various
issues before the committee, proposed
“a nutty idea that I am just throwing
out:” that poor families be given tax
credits to buy computers (never mind
that computer executives told Gingrich
that this was unrealistic). Great. They
may not have a job, but they can down-
load nude pics of Jenny McCarthy off
the intemet.

This belief, that technology is the
end—all to the problems of the world, is
more than a little naive. As we enter the
Information Age, economists are both-
ered by the fact that real wages and
worker productivity are apparently stag-
nating. Technology seems to be divid-
ing the world into the computer literate
haves and the have-nots, who have no
access to this technology.

Don’t get me wrong. Computers
can make our lives easier on many lev-
els. When I write on my computer,
instead of checking my work myself, I
can use my spell check to correct my
(many) mistakes. If I ﬁnd that I use the
word wonderful too much I can find
other ways to convey my opinion that
something is wonderful (“extraordi-
nary,” “great,” “impressive”) by using
the thesaurus.

However, many people (including
myself) have legitimate fears about
technology assuming a greater and
greater role in their lives. A sizeable
portion of society is afraid that comput-
ers and technology are dehumanizing
mankind. Even as we embrace the
march of technology, we must ask our-
selves if we are surrendering our
humanity in the process.

So back to the essential question; is
technology any good? I think so, but its
illusions tempt us to look at the
machines as our saviors instead of our-
selves. America’s greatest asset is our
people. Rather than give serious consid-
eration to Newt’s nutty idea that the
poor and children should have their
very own computers, we should be
looking for more fundamental solutions
like using technology to teach children
to read. The Information Age has the
potential to reap vast rewards, but is
also has the potential to horribly disap-
point us.

Michael Berquist would like to
remind everyone that there is no such
thing as a magical solution.

Picture it — what could be more

exciting than watching grown men
race two—ton, precisely—tuned auto-

200 times around the same circle.

The crowd, thrilled by the repe-

the three—plus hour race to see if one
of their good ol’ boys will win.

They wait impatiently.

“Go faster, Dale, go FASTER!,”
they scream, unable to contain their
infatuation of these machines and
the men who drive them.

They own hats and bumper

Oh, the thrill of auto racing.

'l're¢ia Smith dominates Big. East Championships

Smith scored 45 of Pitt’s 77 points at the Big East meet.

[last

Tuesday, February ‘I8, 1997

There are only a few
things you need to know
about Pitt’s performance
at the Big East Indoor
Track & Field
Championship meet, held
weekend at the
Carrier Dome in
Syracuse, NY. Pitt head
coach Steve Lewis made
those things very clear.

“Trecia Smith. Angie
Martin. Chantee Earl.
And Shana Fadis, too.”

Smith led the Lady
Panthers to a fourth—place
finish as a team, scoring
45 of the team’s 77
points. Smith’s point total
was higher than five of
the 13 teams in the
women’s competition.
There was no contest in
the race ' for the
Outstanding Field
Performer award for the
women at the meet. Of the
six field events (including
the pentathlon) contested,
Smith won four and fin-
ished fourth in the high

jump. Her triple jump of

43-7 1/4 set a meet record
and her long jump of 21-
1/2 tied the meet record.

Smith won the shot
put by more than a foot
with a throw of 45-11 3/4.
She had an equally easy
time in _the pentathlon.
Her total of 4138 points
was over 350 points bet-
ter than her nearest com-
petitor.

“This is her first year
with this kind of responsi-
bility. She performed as if
she’d been doing it for the
last four years,” Lewis
said. “She has the pres-
ence to gauge and pace
and be in control through-
out two days of competi-
tion.”

Martin came in sec-
ond place in the 800
meters with a time of
2:09.34. Less than an
hour later, she turned in a
third—place time of
1:14.22 in the 500 meters.

Earl came in fifth in
the 800 meters with a
time of 2:10.99, missing
the qualifying mark for
the NCAA championship

Humbled tumblers stumble at Rutgers

Steve Stonaha

 

In a year of great expectations,
Pitt gymnasts keep stumbling.

Pitt visited East "Atlantic
Gymnastics League rival Rutgers on
Saturday and fell to the Lady Scarlet
Knights, 190.375 to 189.900.

The Panthers improved on their
score from the previous weekend
but still fell short in their bid to
improve their record. Pitt’s record
falls to 2-7 overall and 1-3 in the
EAGL.

Pitt opened'on the uneven bars
and scored a 47.300. Senior leaders
Lori Buck and Robyn Senior each
scored well on this apparatus. Buck
had a 9.675 and Senior had a strong
9.600.

In the next rotation, Pitt moved
onto the vault. Freddy Alba, Erika
Flamer, and Lisa Fronhofer made
significant contributions. Alba got a
9.725, Flamer performed well
enough to be given ,a 9.650, and
Fronhofer had a 9.600. Pitt had a
team score of 47.325.

Next for Pitt was the floor exer-

cise. This was Pitt’s highest score of
any rotation. The tumblers scored a
48.025. Pitt had four gymnasts score
above a 9.650. Robyn Senior kept
her good season going, finishing
first overall on the floor with a
9.775. Lisa Fronhofer finished sec-
ond overall on the floor with a
9.725. Janet Highhill completed the
sweep of the top three positions on

the apparatus with a 9.700. Erika
Flamer had a 9.650 for fifth.

The beam was the last rotation
for the Pitt tumblers. Lisa Fronhofer
finished third on the apparatus with
a 9.750. Kristin Bond also had a
strong showing with a 9.700 to help
Pitt to a 47.250 on the beam.

“I’m more than impressed with
that,” Lewis said. “I’m excited.”

Shana Fadis had a strong show-
ing in the pentathlon, finishing third
with 3540 points. A

As a team, the Lady Panthers
were fourth in the meet with 77
points. Villanova, led by a strong
showing in‘ the distance events,
edged out Georgetown for the
championship with 116 points.
Georgetown was second with 110.

Pitt’s men had a less successful
day. The men were 12th of the 13
teams with a total of 20 points.
Connecticut and Notre Dame bat-
tled to the end for the top spot, with
Connecticut coming out on top,
128-124.

Like the women, a lot of the
men scored points (by placing in the
top eight in an event). Unlike the
women, the men had no frontrun—

ners racking up first place finishes.
Pitt’s highest finish was a fourth
place in the mile relay, which post-
ed a time-of 3:16.83. The team con-
sisted of Tim Tyre, Orrel Green,
Carl Taylor, and Jerel Williams.
Freshman Brian Richard had the
top individual performance for the
Pitt men, a fifth—place high jump of
6-7. On the track, there were plenty
of seventh-place performances to go
around. There was Scott Curry’s
2:29.64 in the 1000 meters, Jack
Jeffreys’ 7.55 in the 55 meter hur-

dles, Orrel Green’s 1205.5 in the i

500 meters, and Jerel Williams’

This was the first in a series of

the teams. The IC4A and ECAC

Almost no one has ever attended Pitt
simply because of it’s lacrosse program.

However, Pat Shea has been familiar
with the club team most of his life; and
while‘ he was wooed by other he decided
Pitt was it.

Shea, a senior at Pitt, has followed the
team since junior high school.

Today, he is the co—captain of the
team and has seen it through good and
bad times. He is one of the leaders of this
year’s team and one reason for this year’s
high expectations.

He has scored two goals in the two
games Pitt has played this season, and has
also helped out on defense, where the
Panthers have excelled. A

“My main goal is to help the team
win a championship. My senior year, Pitt
won the National Championship and I
want to win it this year, along with help-
ing the team anyway I can. I need to score
goals and play defense to help the team
win.”

“Pat adds a lot of versatility to our
team,” Head coach Gary Neft said. “Last
year he was an attacker, this year he is a
midﬁelder. He is a hustler and he sets an
example for the team and the other play-
ers. Tl1at’s why he was elected by the
team as a co—captain. He’s got a hard work
ethic and he’s always at practices and

THE PI'I"l' NEWS

Shea brings more toPcmthers than just title hopes

ready to go.”

The Panthers are 1-1 overall, but are
focused on winning the Allegheny North
division of the NCLL (National
Collegiate Lacrosse League).

Pat sees this season as an opportunity
for the Panthers to advance far into the
playoffs.

“The teams we had over the last four
years have changed a lot,’’ Shea said.
“Those teams had three to four individu-
als that led the team, but they weren’t a
very‘well—knit bunch. Over the last two
years, the team has been close. I love this
team. That makes us a better team.”

“Pat is a team leader,” senior attacker
Marc Polecritti said.”He is a great player,
but not a showboat. He is always positive
and a good midﬁelder. He is a personal
friend and is an all—around great guy. I
can’t think of anything bad to say about
the guy, and his lacrosse talent stands for
itself.” '

Shea grew up in the nearby South
Hills, where he attended Upper St. Clair
High School and, despite being recruited
by several Division II and HI schools,
Shea chose Pitt.

“I grew up with Pitt and I liked the
campus, and living only twenty minutes
away was a bonus,” he said. “Coach Neft
is involved with several local high school
teams and my high school coach was his
assistant at Pitt before coming to Upper
St. Clair. That made the decision pretty

scrabble up the money for

easy.” 9

Shea began playing lacrosse in junior
high after watching a lacrosse=game on
television. He went on to play in high
school and came to play for Pitt along
with several of his high school team-
mates.

“It is like a high school reunion here
at Pitt,” Shea said. “Dave Travis, the goal-
tender, and a couple of other guys played
at Upper St. Clair and then came to Pitt to
play for Coach N eft.”

The Panthers are a club team, so they
are self—funded. This can add some prob-
lems for anyone on a club team.

“It is very frustrating, but we don’t
have to put up with the pressures that a
varsity team does. This frees up more
time for school work and is not as
demanding,” he said.

As for school work, Shea is a biology
major and plans to go on to Grad school.
After that he wants to research biology
and play lacrosse.

“Not too many people can play pro-
fessional lacrosse, but there are many
men’s leagues to continue playing in. I
know a guy who is over 50—years—old and
still playing,” he said.

Shea plays lacrosse year round and,
when he gets a break, he likes to ski.

“I play in a few summer leagues and
also play at the Lake Placid Shootout,
which is also like a summer league,” he
said.
