Trustees seek student member

UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH if

By Teresa Candori
Staff Writer

The Student Government Board has
announced that a nominating commit-
tee is accepting applications for the
position of student member to the board
of trustees.

A nominating committee, consisting
of Monique Sims, Andy Bacallao and
Jim Mumma of the SGB; Polly Stabile
and Cynthia Lease of the College of
General Studies Student Government;
and Chuck Pascal and Bill Calzo of the
Graduate and Professional Student
Association, will select three nominees
from the applicants. Governor Thorn-

burgh will then choose a student trustee
to serve on the board for the next four
years.

“We're looking for someone who
understands student needs," said
Mumma, “and who would be accessi-
ble to the student government."

The main concern of the student
nominating committee is that the stu-
dent appointed to the board will main-
tain communication with the student
body at large. Mumma said that the
SGB would like the student trustee to
provide a report to the SGB on a
regular basis.

“You can't really require a trustee
to do that,” said Mumma, “but I think
it should be the responsibility _of the stu-

dent member [to report]."

Since 1971, it has been traditional for
the governor of Pennsylvania to ap-
point a student as one of the four
trustees he selects. Because Pitt is a
state-related school. 12 members of the

board of trustees are appointed by the '

Commonwealth — four by the gover-
nor, four by the President Pro Tempore
of the Senate and four by the Speaker
of the House.

“Even though it is a student serving
as a trustee, he or she is an equal to
his or her fellow trustees," said John
R. Quatroche, secretary of the board
of trustees, “and has the same
priviledges as any trustee."

Students celebrate in “sign”

By David James
Staff Writer

The Sign Connection held their third
annual Deaf Awareness Day Monday
in the William Pitt Student Union Ac-
tivities room.

The Sign Connection is a sign
language club here at Pitt. It was
founded in 1983 by Karen Walkney
with the primary goal of spreading deaf
awareness throughout the university
and the surrounding community.

Over 20 different organizations were
invited to participate in the day’s ac-
tivities. The list of groups included the
Catholic Ofﬁce for the Deaf. the Deaf
Lions Club. the Mount Lebanon Sign
Club and a special performance by
students from Penn Cambria Elemen-
tary School.

The students signed to the song
“Celebrate" early in the day and later
were brought back onstage for an en-
core performance. In addition, free
hearing tests were offered. and the
organizations in attendance provided
information, sold souvenirs.

The elementary students were not the
only entertainment available. The per-
forming group Beautiful Hands,
founded by Walkney seven years ago,
entertained the audience with well
choreographed, exciting renditions of
several popular songs. All songs were
done completely in sign language.

Divestment goes to SGB today

Special Projects Editor

posed resolution, an SGB member must
make a motion to take a vote. That mo-
tion must then be seconded before the

‘ vote is called.

Members of the student organization
Students for a Free South Africa will
be seeking SGB’s approval of a pro-
posed resolution calling for total divest-
ment at this afternoon's scheduled
meeting.

“We have the school’s and the com-
munity's endorsement, and we expect
SGB to endorse this proposal, too,”
said Doug Howell of SFSA.

According to Howell, the SFSA had
sought SGB’s approval of the call for
total divestment last January, but SGB
had decided that it needed more time
to review the issue before a vote was
possible.

To gain SGB’s approval of the pro-

SGB member Monique Sims said
yesterday: “I deﬁnitely think we
should take a ﬁrm stance on total
divestment. If they [SFSA] need a mo-
tion and a resolution from the board,
I‘ll support them with it."

Sims added that she knew of at least
two other SGB members, Mary Fratis
and David Konkolics, who would sec-
ond the motion and vote in favor of a
resolution calling for total divestment.
Fratis and Konkolics were not available
for comment.

The SFSA’s presentation was put on
the agenda at their request, according
to SGB President Jim Mumma. As
SGB president, Mumma will oversee

the SFSA’s presentation and any
response by the board.

“I, as president, can’t vote or par-
ticipate in the discussion," said Mum-
ma. “It's my job to control the ﬂoor,
and that's all. If a member of the board
wishes to present the SFSA's resolu-
tion, that’s their prerogative.”

There has been some conﬂict between
the SFSA and SGB over the issue of
divestment. Members of SFSA feel that
SGB has been unreasonably reluctant
to come out in support of a ﬁrm resolu-
tion calling for total divestment.

Questions concerning SGB’s handl-
ing of the issue date back to last
November’s SGB member and presi-
dent campaigns. At that time, accord-
ing to BAS Political Action Chairman
Rashid Soundiata, BAS had endorsed

The University of Pittsburgh has
begun’ investigating an incident which
resulted in the stabbing of three Pitt
students last Saturday night on Semple
Street.

The university's Department of
Public Safety and the Ofﬁce of the Vice
President for Student Affairs have
begun an administrative investigation
concerning the incident because they
are concerned about student safety at
Pitt.

“We intend to take maximum action
against any student found to be in-
volved in the stabbing incident," said
Dennis Donham, assistant vice presi-
dent for Student Affairs.

The stabbing incident is thought to
be a spill-over from‘a football game
between Kappa Alpha Psi and another
Pitt fraternity. The name of the second
fraternity has not yet been released.

“No sanctions are being taken

University investigates
stabbing of three students

against the fraternity but instead against
the individuals," stated Donham. He
added that non-students as well as Pitt
students were involved in the incident.

According to city police reports, the
students were on their way to buy beer
after the football game when they were
attacked by two carloads of males. A
ﬁght started, and three were stabbed.
A fourth student was also attacked, but
his name has not yet been released. He
was taken to Magee—Women's Hospi-
tal, treated and released.

Mercy Hospital ofﬁcials stated that
Pitt student Todd Jackson, one of the
victims, was released from Mercy
Hospital. Percy White and Patrick
Anyanwu—Ebo, the other victims, are
in good condition in Presbyterian-
University Hospital, according to Mark
Collins, hospital ofﬁcial.

As for the criminal investigation,
none of the city police investigators
could be reached for an update on the
progress of the investigation. However,
the main suspect has been identiﬁed
and is under investigation.

Fire safety

Is evacuation of handicapped adequate?

By Teresa Candori
Staff Writer

On Feb. 18. the ﬁre alarms in
Holland Hall sounded. As would any
dorm residents. the students in Holland
reacted calmly and swiftly. evacuating
the building as quickly as possible.
However, one student, unable to
evacuate, was left behind.

Freshman Christine Ward, who lives
on the seventh ﬂoor of Holland Hall,
is conﬁned to a wheelchair. She is
unable to use the six ﬂights of stairs
between her room and the ground
ﬂoor. As a result, she had been in-
stmcted to telephone the campus police
in case of an emergency.

“The police nevercame, noonecalled.
I was just ignored," Ward said. “The
excuse I was given was that the police
did come, but they found out it was a
false alarm and turned around.”

Meanwhile, no one had informed
Ward that the alarm was a false one.
Because of the special procedures in-
volved in evacuating handicapped
students, Ward is always given prior
notice when a ﬁre drill is to be con-
ducted. Since she had received no such
notiﬁcation prior to the Feb. 18 alarm,
Ward assumed that there was a real
ﬁre.

“There was a communication prob-
lem," said Walt Waters of the Depart-
ment of Public Safety. “They [the cam-
pus police] started out very well, but
they messed it up by not putting
themselves in the position of a handi-
capped person.”

Water said that an ofﬁcer was dis-
patched to Ward's room, discovered
that the alarm had been set off by
nothing more than the smoke from

burning food. Because the ofﬁcer knew
that Ward was not in any danger, he
did not proceed to her room. However,
he failed to inform her of the situation.

“They just weren't thinking and put-
ting themselves in the place ofa hand-
icapped person. While they knew she
wasn't in any danger, poor Chris
didn't.“ Waters said.

A few weeks later. on March 14, the
ﬁre alarms again went off in Holland
Hall. Because Ward had received no

‘ ‘The police never came,
no one called. I was just ig-
nore . ”

—- Christine Ward

prior notiﬁcation, she again assumed
a real emergency was at hand.

“This time the police did show up, A

but they didn’t know what to do,”
Ward said. “They were asking me,
‘What are we supposed to do now?’
One ofﬁcer suggested taking the
elevator."

When the ﬁre alarms in the dorms
are activated, the elevators in the
building automatically go to the ground
ﬂoor and cannot be operated by anyone
but city ﬁre personnel who have a key.

Fortunately, the March 14 alarm
turned out to be false also. However,
concerned with her safety, Ward went
to speak to Gerry Kowalski, an assis-
tant director of residence life.

V “I told her that the campus police

aren't the people who would be

evacuating her, number one,I’

Light One Up

With the announcement on Monday that Pitt is mov-
ing the 1986 football season opener to Labor Day night
came a message —— night football will play a large role
in the future of the University of Pittsburgh.

It was tried twice last season, and the response was
more than sufﬁcient. Both games, the season opener
against Purdue and the season ﬁnale against Penn State,
were nationally televised. Still, the games produced the
two largest crowds of the season.

The other Pitt home games — Saturday afternoon
games — produced sparse crowds. It was quite evident
that Pittsburghers have better things to do on a fall after-
noon than spend it at Pitt Stadium. That is why Pitt must
move most — if not all — of the home football games
to the evenings in the years to come.

The ﬁrst step towards this would be installing per-
manent lighting at Pitt Stadium. Last fall, Pitt had the
stadium re-wired to accomodate permanent lighting but
had to rent the lights when it came time for the Purdue
and Penn State games. In turn, the stadium looked
generic, and the university looked silly.

The addition of Mike Gottfried to the football pro-
gram brought a breath of fresh air and a chance to regain
the prestige that was lost during the last several years.

While this is the beginning of the Gottfried era, it
should also be the beginning of the night football era
at Pitt. Pittsburgh is a night city. It is not a small col-
lege town where people get out the camper and tailgate
all day long. It is a town where people relax during the
day and go out at night — to a Pitt football game and
a bar afterwards.

It is a step in the right direction. The attendance would
grow drastically, and Pitt would be more apt to receive
better television exposure.

When you try to have a big time, first class program,
you must cover all the bases. Permanent lights have not
been covered yet, and the time to do it is now.

Like many others, I am sure, I ﬁnd
it difﬁcult to allow Stephen Morrison's
article (The Pitt News, March 28) to go
unchallenged. The issue of divestment
is clearly one on which there is much
disagreement, and many of those who
argue against it do, indeed. have per-
tinent and credible reasons for their
feelings. Equally as pertinent and credi-
ble. I believe. are the counter-_
arguments. However, because Morri-
son's article did not focus primarily on
the pros and cons of divestment. this
article will not deal directly with that
complex issue.

Morrison raised a number of supple-
mentary issues. however. which must
be confronted and clariﬁed. After
describing collegiate anti-apanheid ac-
tivists as being “naive. misguided. 
and incredibly stupid." Morrison pro-
ceeded to state that the Botha govern-
ment is a “fairly progressive one." and
that “until the American press adopted
the situation as its pet overseas atroci-
ty. slow reform seemed to be solving
the problem." Coming from someone
who attaches the label of “incredibly
stupid" to others. this statement
amazes me. Surely Morrison is not say-
ing that because only in the last few
years he has been seeing scenes of
violence and unrest in South Africa on
his television or in the pages of his
newspaper, it follows that all was well
well before that?

Is it really the so-called “disinvest-
ment groupies" who are “incredibly
stupid?”

For Mr. Morrison's beneﬁt, here are
a few pieces of infomiation to think
about. As surprising as this may be to
Morrison, there was a great deal of in-
ternal opposition to apartheid in South
Africa before the U.S. press “a-
dopted" the situation. I wonder if Mor-
rison knows that the African National
Congress, for example, did not come
into being on the day he first saw pic-
tures of violence in South Africa. When
Morrison read Paul Johnson's article,
I wish he had done some very basic
research into the history of the strug-
gle against racial inequality in South
Africa. If he had, he would have come
across the fact that the ANC has been

in existence. and has been ﬁghting
against white supremacy since 1912.
He would also have come across the
fact that as far back as 1952, acts of
civil disobedience were taking place in
Port Elizabeth. East London. Cape
Town and Johannesburg, amongst
other places. He would certainly have
read about what happened in Sharpe-
ville in March 1960. One wonders if
the word “Soweto“ and the day June

16. I976 are at all familiar to Mr.
Morrison.

Contrary to Morrison‘s statement.
so-called “slow reform" was not solv-
ing South Africa's problems, and will
not do so in the future. If Morrison
believes that trivial measures such as
the repeal of the lmmorality Act or the
partial desegregation of theaters will
solve South Africa‘s problems, then it
is he who is “naive" and “incredibly
stupid.“ The struggle in South Africa
is no longer solely one for the aboli-
tion of apartheid; the struggle is now
one for political power for the majori-
ty. “No tinkering with apartheid, no
promise of reforms. will deter us from
this declared goal." is how ANC Presi-
dent Oliver Tambo has stated it.

And getting back to the issue of “in-
credible stupidity." Morrison's linkage
of “rigid police action" in South Africa
to the population explosion in that
country must surely rank as one ofthe
most preposterous and offensive ideas
yet seen on these pages. Justifying the
atrocities of Botha's police force on the
grounds that they are “simply trying
to ensure the survival ofthe state itself"
reeks of either pitiful ignorance or crass
tiialevolcnce. I don't know whether
Morrison is to be despised or pitied.

Morrison‘s claim that South Africa
is a “typical African nation." and that
“all African states are racist" is one
which he must substantiate. and I per-
sonally await such substantiation with
much anticipation. Like all other na-
tions of the world, the nations to the
north of South Africa undoubtedly have
their faults, but can Morrison give a
credible example of any one of them
in which repressive minority domi-
nance a la South Africa, is practiced?

“Naive, misguided, and  in-
credibly stupid.” An accurate descrip-
tion by Morrison, but of whom? At
least it cannot be said that all he wrote
in his article was disagreeable. Ab-
solutely not. Morrison did say that the
situation vis-a-vis South Africa was
“infinitely more complicated than it
seems." That it is. Perhaps some peo-
ple ought to stick to the task of writing
record reviews, rather than exposing
their naivete on issues of substance and
concern.

Unborn Rights

I do not wish to bore people on the
topic of abortion, but it seems to be a
very controversial issue here on cam-
pus. Thus far the medical issue and the
rights of women have been discussed.
What about the rights of the unborn
child?

Ms. Hallsten, I believe you have the
misconception that all pro-life groups
are arguing the fact that women, as

The Pitt News, April 9, 1986

well as men. do not have the freedom
to choose what they will do with their
bodies. From my experience with two
pro-life groups. this is not the case. No
person should be denied their rights un-
til they infringe upon the rights of
others.

The world today has become a very
selﬁsh place. The focus is on “What
can I do for me?" not “What harm will
I do to others?“ Pro-choicers seem to
be more worried about the one choice
they will be denied, but they do not
think of the many choices that will be
denied the unborn child. The most
basic of these is the choice of life ar ,
what they will choose to do with that
life.

If you choose not to raise a child.
then you should take preventive
measures to ensure that you will not
become impregnated. Many people
ask. “What about when the rights of
the women are infringed upon by
rape?” This is a very tragic happen-
ing. but does it give the vvonian the
right to infringe upon the life of the un-
born child. one of the victims in this
situatioii‘? The child played no part in
this violent crime. yet he vsill be
punished for it. No defense. no trial by
jury. just conviction. sentence and ex-
ecution. The judicial system does not
even deal that harshly with the rapist.

Yes. Ms. Hallsten. you and all
women. myself included. should be
given the “right" to do as we please
with our bodies. This right is only valid
if it does not infringe upon the rigﬁ
of another. in this case the unborn

mm business. just sitting there. mind

asks me if Ill go down to the quad to
report on the pudding wrestling portion
ofSpring Fling. Ithink. Iponder. Sure.
I say. I mean. I could tell the people
in charge that I'm doing a story on the
important event, and they'd give me a

dessert that's served in the cafs, either
fresh or with the familiar plastic coating

I arrive. and the scene is perfect: a
balmy night in the quad. music blar-
ing in the background and a large
crowd buzzing anxiously in heated an-
ticipation of the main event. I make my
way over to the large. white moving
truck that transported all the materials
for this battle royale. There I ﬁnd Ken-
neth D. Zenkevich and Joseph J.
Schmidlin, the  uh  executive pro-

 

ducers of the slug-fest. They're busy
taking applications from would-be
wrestlers and having these hopefuls
sign a release form. due to the inherent
and ever—prescnt danger of chocolate
pudding at Pitt.

When they turn away the last bunch
of people. saying that all slots have
been ﬁlled. they give me a little
background on pudding wrestling at
Pitt. The ofﬁcial title. according to
IIICSC two. is “The Annual Spring Fling
Pudding Wrestling Tourney.“ lt‘s
sponsored by the Ofﬁce of Residence
Life and the quad ORL staff. We then
begin to joke about the dopes who are

' actually going to jump into a baby pool

full of pudding and wrestle, while a few
hundred of their peers look on and lose
any or all respect that they may have
held for the wrestlers.

Just when the yuk yuks are at their
peak, a female participant comes over
to the truck looking distraught. She has
lost her partner. He (like a wise per-
son) backed out at the last minute. She

serious. He said that all good reporters
get involved with their topic as riiuch
as they can. He said that it'd be fun.
He said that I'd be wrestling against a
cute little blond standing by the
chocolate ring.

I think he got me with the last reason.
‘cause if you were there. you saw me
there too. The ref blew the whistle to
begin one of the most humiliating
events of my life. I went after the cute
blond I mentioned, as my male oppo-
nent went after my female partner. I
was greeted with a handful of pudding
to the face. Not only was I blinded with
this foreign object, but the force of her
thrust made me slip and fall on my butt.
She then leaped upon me and proceed-

Pitt students and faculty may soon be

Africans. due to an effort headed by
, David Platt. a professor in the School
of Dental Medicine.

Platt proposes that the university
community sponsor black South Af-

the proposal, young black South
Africans would attend public schools
in the Pittsburgh area, and their living
expenses would be picked up by Pitt

“People in the university will be able to give in a per-
sonal way, to help black South Africans obtain their

educational objectives. "

—— David Platt

G

objectives." Platt said.

Platt presented the plan to the senate
council in February. and the concept
was approved. Now Platt is attempting
to get the university to come forth with
the funds. One way to produce the
capital would be through a payroll
deduction plan where a few dollars
would be deducted each month frorii
university paychecks. This would be
similar to how Pitt supports the United
Way.

Platt also suggested that Pitt offer
students a way to donate money. The
University of Colorado. for example.
suggests to their students that they in-
clude a one dollar donation to help
educate South African blacks each time
the students pay their tuition. Platt said
the university of Colorado currently
educates about 20 black South African
undergraduate and graduate students.

The reason Platt recommends that
Pitt work with children of primary and
secondary school age is that South
Africa's educational system for non-
white South Africans is abysmal. The
elementary level teacher-student ratios
for whites is 1:18 and for blacks 1:40.
according to Platt. Only 20 percent of
the teachers in black schools have high
school diplomas. in contrast to 1()() per-
cent in white schools.

The claim has been made that educa-
tion for blacks in South Africa is sec-
ond to none in Africa. but Platt reveals
statistics that dispute this. In a coni-
parison of 12 African countries. South
Africa ranks fifth in per capita expen-
diture on education. According to the
findings. however. the average expen-
diture on education per white student
is $1.323; per black student it is only
$178.

Platt said that 50 percent of all black
students drop out of school by the

seventh grade. and the black literacy
rate is only 20 percent.

In summarizing P|att's assessment of
the South African educational system,
he says there are six main problems:
Poorly built schools. high student-
teacher ratios. a lack of textbooks (and
those that are supplied are biased). un-
trained and poorly paid teachers. an
authoritarian school system and very
inadequate funding.

Pitt is currently sponsoring educa-
tions for four black South African
students at the university. The number
of students is low because of the cost
and also because there aren't many
black students in South Africa able to
compete at a major American univer-
sity. according to a report on the South
African Educational Program. The
report states that only about 80 students

qualify for admission to American‘

universities.

“lt‘s not a question of a lack of in-
telligence of these black students,"
Platt said. “it's just that the South
African government gives very little
toward black education.“

Platt also said that helping black
South African students is not an alter-
native to divestment. but it is a way to
help blacks.

Doug Howell. from Students for a
Free South Africa. said that he would
support such a program. but that his
group's main goal is Pitt's total divest-
ment of funds from companies doing
business in South Africa.

“1 would support it as long as it
doesn't become the main issue."
Howell said. "We‘re still committed
to a total divestment.

"lt sounds like a good idea. but I

wouldn't trust the Board of Trustees or '

Pitt's administration to manipulate it."
Howell said.

The staff of the Office of Affirmative Action is pleased
to announce that, on Thursday, April 10, 1986, they
will open their new offices in 901 William Pitt Union.
From Monday, April 7 through Wednesday, April 9, the
Office of Afftmiative Action will be closed. However.
staff will man the telephones during this transitional

period.

Mumma. however, contends that he

But SFSA and BAS argue that all the

Kowalski said. “And two, we do have

“It’s a joint effort among many.dIf-‘

However. Ward is not expected to

Ward dated March 12, Kowalski in-

place on March 25 and that Ward was
not expected to be evacuated. I

“Given the inconvenience of the

evacuation,“ the letter stated, “it will

The reason why wheelchair-bound
students are not required to evacuate
during a drill, according to Kowalski,
is because the city ﬁre personnel are
not on hand to operate the elevators and
there is too much risk involved in car-

rying the student down the stairs 
it is not absolutely necessary.

None of the dorms at Pitt have stu-
dent rooms on the ﬁrst ﬂoor. Because
Ward can descend a ﬂight of stairs us-
ing braces in an emergency, she said
she would feel safer if she were living
on the second floor.

“I told them [in the housing ofﬁce]
that I could handle one ﬂight if it’s an
emergency. But six?" Wand said,

When Ward called the Veterans/Dis-
abled Student Services to ask about 

seventh-ﬂoor assignment, she said shc '

wastoldthattheuniversitydijlnotwug

to create It "ghetto" for  .

students on the lower floors; .2

. Wad was assignodtoa  
roontasaresultofafailureiacoui-,'
munication between the  ofﬁce -
and the Veterans/Disabled student sér- "

vices ofﬁce. _ .

“At the time Chris applied, there
was a changeover in staff in the Ofﬁce
of Disabled Students, and we didn't get
the information [about Ward's handi-
cap] in time. And then all the second-
and third-ﬂoor rooms were ﬁlled up,“
said Bob Robinson, assistant directtﬁ‘
of housing. “We couldn't go and ask
those people to move.“

According to Robinson, the univer-
sity does provide modiﬁed housing for
the handicapped in Tower C. These
modified rooms have lower phones.
mirrors and closets. and the bathrooms

3 have tilted mirrors and bathtubs with

railings. Ward was offered the option
of Svt itching to one of these rooms but
turncd it down.

“Those rooms are on the twelfth
floor. and Id be cvcn higher off the

I ground than I am now," Ward said.
I “The evacuation procedure is the same

over there. and I wanted a roommate."
All of the rooms in Tower C are
single—occupancy.

On March 25 another ﬁre drill was
conducted in Holland Hall. Because she
had been informed, Ward was aware
that the alarm was not a real emergency‘?

“We had a scenario that the ﬁre was
in the middle of the seventh ﬂoor,"
Ward Said. “An engineer had a key to
the elevators and he brought it up to
the seventh floor."

Kowalski said the scenario was car-
ried out just as though there were a real
emergency. “That's just what would
happen in case ofa real ﬁre,“ he said.
“Although the engineer would not be
present. the city ﬁne people would have
a key to the elevator.“

Although the last ﬁre drill appeared
to go smoothly, Ward said that she felt
campus security and the housing ofﬁce
were trying to “put on a show."

“I think she has reason to be con-
cemed.“ said Sabina Bilder, student
services specialist. “I think there
should be some actual hands-on ex-
perience  to have an actual evacua-
tion of a handicapped person. You czﬂ
never guarantee that any one person

’ will be on duty at any speciﬁc time."

According to Waters, evacuation of
handicapped students in an emergen-
cy will be one topic discussed at a May

- S in-service for the campus police.

Part-time jobs rise
as loans decrease

Kim nudges her way through the
crowded hallways of the Cathedral as
she heads toward the swinging doors.
All around her were Friday afternoon
plans of “happy hour" and fraternity
parties. ()f course she isn't going —
she has to work again this weekend. By
the time she is through this evening, it
will be close to midnight and too late
to venture into Oakland on her own,
and she can't ask her friends to wait.
Another Friday night in, she thinks. but
as usual. I need the money.

Kim‘s plight probably sounds fa-
miliar to many students. As student aid
becomes increasingly more difﬁcult to
obtain and student loans become scarce.
more and more students must fund their
schooling via part-time jobs.

Andy Smith, director of Student
Activities. suggested that in the future.
the number of working students will
continue to grow. He estimated that
between 50-60 percent of Pitt‘s 29,()()0
students presently have part-time jobs.

“As ﬁnancial aid opportunities be-
come less and less, and you look at
some of the things that have been hap-
pening in the federal govemment. more
students are going out to ﬁnd part-time
jobs. I'd say that 50 to 60 percent of
our students (at Pitt) work. That will
increase.“

The reality of students with part--time
jobs is not new.

“Part-time jobs go back a long time.
at least 20 years or so." said Smith.
“I had a job with the university when
I was a student, and there were a great
deal of advantages involved.“

When you work in a university, first
of all it's easy to get to, because it's
right here." he said. “Also, it gives
one a feeling of belonging, to be part
of a community. You can get a lot of
insight as to how the university works
by being a pan of things. You get to
know people in the different depart-
ments. which can help you in a number
of ways."

“Even working outside the univer-
sity has its advantages," said Smith.
“You can get experience in you career
choice, like by working at Mellon Bank

if you’re interested in banking. There
is a certain status involved in working.
You have independence from your
parents ﬁnancially, and you learn dis-
cipline. It's a training for the future."

By working in different situations.
you learn what people expect of you —
even if it‘s wearing a uniform. If you
work at McDonald‘s, you wear a uni-
form. If you work at Mellon Bank, you
wear a uniform. Of course they're two
different types of uniforms. but you
learn to dress the part."

Smith does not see very many prob-
lems with students having to work. He
believes that it is all a matter of time
management. a matter of setting pri-
orities.

“As ﬁnancial aid oppor-
tunities become less and less,
and you look at some of the
things that have been happen-
ing in the federal govern-
ment, more students are go-
ing out to ﬁnd part-time
jobs. ”

— Andy Smith
Director, Student Activities

“Students that receive work study
jobs work about 15 hours a week. and
we try not to give the others any more
than twenty hours,“ he said. “Students
that work outside of the university
work as much as they need to."

Students learn that they need to set
aside certain times —— personal time,
physical heath time and mental health
time." he said.

According to a number of students
interviewed, most employers are very
cooperative and are willing to schedule
around any class or exam conﬂicts.

Candace Carlin, a part-time waitress
and bartender at Thirsty’s bar in North
Oakland, is a senior majoring in child
care and development. As a full-time

student, Carlin has not yet found any
conflicts with work and school.

“They’re really good about sched-
uling, where I work," said Carlin. “If
you need a day off for school. they’ll
give it to you. l‘ve had to ask off for
finals, and they gave it to me. Some-
times I don't get home until three in the
morning, and I can‘t really study
then.“

Carolyn Mancinelli agreed. “Work-
ing doesn‘t interfere with too much
because they‘ll let us schedule around
our activities," she said. Mancinelli is
a senior majoring in communications.
She works part-time at Baskin-Robbins.

Another reason that many students
work is for the extra cash. For both
Carlin and Mancinelli. earning extra

spending money was the reason they ~

gave for working.
‘‘I’d be borrowing money from my
parents ifl didn‘t work," said Carlin.

"This is a lot easier on me and my .

parents. Plus. this summer Ill be

working to pay for apartment rent and "

to hold me over until I get ajob in my
major."

“I wanted to get an apartment, and ‘I ‘

I had to pay for it, so I had to ﬁnd a
job,“ said Mia Yates, ajunior major-
ing in English writing. Yates works
every weekend as a waitress.

“Since I couldn‘t get any ﬁnancial
aid, and I don't get much from student
loans, if I want to have any money at
all I have to work," she said.

“It interferes with my free time, my
Friday nights, but I don‘t mind. I usual-
ly get off work around midnight. so
there‘s still time to go out."

Now that the summer months are
near. many students will be looking for
summer jobs.

“We see a lot of students coming in
now the warm weather is here. the sun
is out. their faces are tan from Soldiers
and Sailors, and now they start to think
about money," said Robert Hopkins,
director of the University Placement
Service.

Students can go to the Student Em-
ployment ofﬁce, which is a division of
the Placement Center, to look for part-

time employment for both the summers
and during school. But according to
Hopkins, now is not the best time to
look for work with his ofﬁce.
“Students who wait until late March
or April to check with us often miss out
on the better opportunities. The best
time to come in is right in the begin-
ning of January or February, when a
lot of the companies come to us adver-
tising for jobs. Some of the bigger

firms that pay up to $l200 a month or
so come to our ofﬁce in October.
Students can refer to these jobs, and
many of them will know by December
who they will be working for in the
summer."

Hopkins explained how the Student
Employment Office, located on the sec-
ond ﬂoor of the William Pitt Union, is
run.

Bulimics respond to ’80s image

By Stephanie Frelick
Staff Writer

It was 2 a.m. “I'm ﬁnally
home," diought Christine. Not that
she didn't enjoy being out with her
friends, but it was too many hours
to keep it secret. She shut the front
door, hurried up the steps to the
bathroom and locked the door. For
nearly a half hour, she vomited. But
it wasn't from the one beer. It was
the food — the food she’d eaten that
day. “How could I have eaten that
much,“ she said to herself.

With the ﬂoor spinning, Chris-
tine slowly made her way to the
bedroom. She did sit—ups and other‘
exercises. She had to punish herself
for that food. An hour
later, sweat rolled down her fore-
head, and she peered into the mir-
ror. Her face was chalk—white and
her body drained —— probably from
the other four times she‘d vomited
that day. “When would it stop?"
she asked herself. “When?"

Christine, who wishes to remain

anonymous, has been undergoing
treatment for bulimia for ﬁve years.
She is not alone in her dilemma.
Approximately one to three million
American women can sympathize
with Christine -— they too have
bulimia, which has become known
as the eating disorder of the '80s.
It is the sister disorder of anorexia
nervosa, and translated from Greek
means “ox appetite."

Historical medical records show
that bulimia has existed for some
300 years, but only recently has
reached epidemic proportions.

Because of its prevalence, bu-
limia is increasingly becoming a
focus of attention. So much so, that
the government decided to fund
selected areas to conduct studies
and research. Western Psychiatric
Institute and Clinic in Pittsburgh is
one of the federally funded centers.

While bulimia has recently re-
placed anorexia nervosa as the most
widespread eating disorder among
women (only I percent of bulimics
are men), new knowledge about the
illness is constantly surfacing. For

example. «pens seem to have pin-
pointed a number of possible causes
of bulimia. Social analysts point to
the inﬂuence of society and media
which stress the importance of thin-
ness as a cause of the disease.
Young people are brainwashed to
think that the more weight they
lose, the better they will look, and
consequently, they will be more
accepted.

Although bulimia can occur at
any time, ‘young people are the
most susceptible —.- especially at
two particular times The first is
just before or just after puberty,
when young people may subcon-
sciously try to delay the physical
maturation of their bodies. The sec-
ond is when major stresses enter the
scene: divorce of parents, death of
a loved one, a broken love relation-
ship or ridicule by others for be-
coming fat.

Until recently, the victims were
thought to be almost exclusively
middle- or upper—class adolescent
girls with above-average intelli-
gence. However, the latest research

shows that the problem cuts across
socioeconomic, racial, intellectual
and age boundaries.

According to Dr. George Hsu,
director of the Eating Disorders
Clinic at WPIC, the average age
range for bulimics is 15-45. Also,
he pointed out the serious propor-
tions the disorder has reached. “If
100 people are on a diet, 20 ofthem
will develop bulimia," he said.

In the process of developing the
illness, food serves to comfort the
victim, and she ﬁnds herself trap-
ped between two' opposing desires:
to be thin and to eat as much as she
wants. Thus the binge and purge
cycle (overeating and vomiting) is
put into effect. The methods most
often used by bulimics to compen-
sate for binging are vomiting and
using laxatives and diuretics. But
the victims then pay a price for
using these measures.

Hsu suggested that damage to the
kidneys, heart, esophagus and
stomach are the main dangers. But,
he said “Loss of monthly periods,
dry skin, and dental decay are also

common problems."

What makes’ bulimia different
from the other eating disorder -
anorexia nervosa? The reason bu-
limia is replacing anorexia nervosa
as the means to achieve the ideal
body image is because it is mani-
fested somewhat more discreetly.

“Since Miss Americas are
weighing less each year, women
who become obsessed with losing
weight turn to something easier
than anorexia." noted Hsu.

Bulimia is considered to be an
“casier" way out due to some of
its characteristics. For example,
unlike anorexics, bulimics are at
nomial body weight. Therefore, the
victims are rarely thought to have
a problem. Also, the binging of
high-calorie foods is secretive.

But marked differences do exist
between the two disorders. While
an anorexic turns away from food
to cope, the bulimic seeks comfort
in food. Denying their hunger is
common for anorexics; bulimics
are aware of their hunger. Those

“We post positions that come into

 the office from the different companies
 around the Pittsburgh area." said

Hopkins. “We don’t advertise for

f‘ many outside the area unless it is for

a summer position. so that most jobs
are easy to get to."
Any student who is registered with

 the university can requst referrals for

the different jobs posted. regardless of
whether he is eligible for student aid
— unlike work study which is granted
according to a student’s ﬁnancial needs.
The jobs the placement center adver—
tises range from library work on cam-
pus. and various on—campus jobs. to
off-campus jobs with fast food places
or companies.

There are. according to Hopkins.
nearly 5.()00 students registered with
the Student Employment Office. so the
jobs are competitive.

"The number of students looking for
jobs has been increasing." said Hop-
kins. “I’d say that the number has gone
up almost 10 percent from last year.
This is. of course. due to the fact that
ﬁnancial aid is being reduced. But there
are positions available."

Hopkins suggests a number of other
ways students can go about finding
part-time employment. including: a)

But they tell them very little about
what they'll be doing until they get
them into a meeting with other stu-
dents." said Tom Rush. a counselor
with the Student Employment Office.
"They get suckered in by what they
want to hear."

Commission sales often involve
making the sttident purchase a sample
kit. which can cost up to $260. The stu-
dent gives the company this money,
and is then sent out to sell the product
on a commission basis. Often. the com-
pany is not concerned with whether or
not the student actually sells anything.

“The desire is less to have the stu-
dent do good work but more for what
money the company can make from the
student." said Hopkins.

In general. in the Pitt student popula-
tion. males work about I2 hours a week
and females about ten. Not many work
more than 20 hours a week. and most
receive minimum wage. according to
the Student Employment Office. Un-
doubtedly. most will have nights like
Kim‘.s. but there are benefits.

Students protest double  
charges for PFM classes  

Carolyn Maneinelli replaces everyone’s favorite, Jamoca Almond
Fudge.

rsty’s, Candy Carlin wipes the bar.

By David James
Staff Writer

Tom showed up at registration anx-
ious to get started with his higher
education. As he ﬁlled in a few of his
required courses, something caught his
eye. He had always wanted to learn
about movies and how to make them,
and here was his chance. Eagerly he
filled in the alpha code; could
Hollywood be far behind?

Unfortunately, Tom ended up in
Terre Haute. He didn't realize that he
would have to pay for his film class
twice — once to the university and once
to Pittsburgh Film Makers. Typical
Tom simply couldn‘t afford the extra
cash and dropped the class.

Tom is a composite character,
representing the experience of the 98
students per term who take classes at
PFM. But the situation is real, and the
problem has been around since 1972.
Pittsburgh Film Makers. located in
Oakland, provides classes for students
on the technical aspects of ﬁlm mak-
ing and photography. The classes are
offered to students at Camegie-Mellon,
Point Park and Carlow as well as to
students at Pitt. The difference lies in
the fact that Carnegie-Mellon, Point
Park. Carlow and Pitt's College of
General Studies pay the Film Makers‘
fee for their students. Students in the
College of Arts and Sciences. however.
pay their own fee. Over the past cou-
ple of years. both students and faculty
have attempted to have this policy
changed. but have been unsuccessful.

The teachers and administrators at
Pittsburgh Film Makers are in a dif-
ficult position. stuck between the
students who complain about the extra
cost. or possibly skip the course
altogether. and the Pitt administration
with whom they have shared a strong
working relationship for several years.
one that they hope will continue. This
working relationship docs benefit
students since they are given a discount
rate compared to other schools. But
even a discounted payment is too much
for many students to pay.

Brady Lewis, head of the PFM film
making department explained the prob-
lems they face in dealing with the

situation.

“It can only be detrimental to us to
fight with Pitt about it,” said Lewis.
“lt’s not going to make us any richer
if'.Pitt changes their policy, but I think
it would be more fair to the students.

“It would also take a lot of pressure
off of us, because we wouldn’t hear
their [the students’] complaints. But
meanwhile there’s nothing we can do
to change it, we can only lose by get-
ting very involved in fighting about it
with the Pitt administration.”

So again, the students face the
responsibility for initiating the change.
According to Lewis, the staff does talk
to the students about the situation and
will continue to do so, but they can't
pressure them into making changes.

“The official university
position is simply that they
don ’t want to pay any money
out to Pittsburgh Film
Makers. My own position on
this is that I ’m completely in
support of the ﬁlm studies
program. I think the double
billing should be ended. "

—- Irwin Schulman
Office of the Provost

"We’re going to fill our classes with
Point Park and C MU students if they’re
not filled with Pitt students. anyway.
Most of our classes are closed every
term.“ said Lewis.

Pitt administrators have differing
viewpoints on the solution to this prob-
lem. Dean Rosenberg. Faculty of Arts
and Sciences, said that he felt it was
perfectly justifiable to expect students
to pay the fees. Dean Schulman, Col-
lege of Arts and Sciences. however,
disagreed.

“The ofﬁcial university position is
simply that they don't want to pay any
money out to Pittsburgh Film

Makers,” he said. “My own position
on this is that I’m completely in sup-
port of the film studies program. I think
that the double billing should be end-
ed. I have been saying that for years,
but I haven’t gotten anywhere."

According to Schulman, the pro-
vost’s office is unwilling to part with
any additional funds to pay the fees for
students. Subsequently, any funds that
would be used for fees would have to
come from the CAS budget.

“The problem is we’re perennially
short. we’re chronically short of money
for all kinds of purposes in the College
of Arts and Sciences. And from the
point of view of Dean Rosenberg,
who's basically the chief budget officer
for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences,
there are so many other demands on
that money that he can't see his way
clear to using it for that purpose,”
Schulman explained. A

That point of view could be very
damaging to Pitt’s film studies program
in the long run, said Schulman. “My
own view is that it is unfair to the
students and it’s harmful to the future
of the ﬁlm studies program.”

Schulman thinks that the future could
be very promising as Pitt has good
basic facilities with which to work and
grow.

“We have in Pittsburgh, at this
university and in the Film Makers, and
in our association with the film section
of the Museum of Art at Carnegie
Museum — we have all the ingredients
for a nationally prominent ﬁlm studies
program." said Schulman.

“This business of forcing students to
pay this extra fee I think is a real
obstacle in the growth of the film
studies program here at Pitt. It makes
it very hard to attract students into the
program. it breeds resentment, it sym-
bolizes to the students that the univer-
sity doesn‘t care about the film studies
program. I agree with all those com-
plaints."

sity paying the fees for film making

Craig Pearson
For The Pitt News

The University of Pittsburgh
Police Department is thought of by
some as just security guards or
“rent-a-cops.” I spent the last two
weeks walking, talking and riding
with the officers, and what I have
seen indicates that the myths about
them are just that, myths.

The university’s police depart-
ment has a 57—meinber force con-
sisting of police officers and securi-
ty guards. It is the third largest
police force in the county, behind
the city police and the county
police.

University police officers have
the same powers of arrest that city

restricted to the university proper‘

ties and adjacent property. There-

fore, the campus police deal with
the city police in some cases. As the
university is in the city. there will
be interactions.

I walked a beat with one of the
officers on the II p.in. to 7 a.in.
shift. It was one of those slow
nights. Just before midnight, of-
ficers were called to the law school,
where someone was writing on the
walls with magic marker. The
perpetrator ran as the officers ar-
rived. From there, we moved on to
“crush crime," as the officer
called it. We stopped in at the front
desks of the dorms in the Quad
area.

Soon after we left one of the
desks, we were called back to check

on the attendant. It ttirned out that
there was nothing to worry about.
but the call had sounded serious.
About one hour had elapsed since
that call when we received a call
that someone had run into the door
in the Quad. ()n this call. the per~
son had done quite a bit of damage
to the door.

There were other circumstances
that led to this person’s being
placed under arrest. By then, the
shift was over, and the sun rose to
a very quiet and peaceful Oakland.
It was time to start all over again.

While I was with the campus po-
lice the First Seneca Bank was held
up. The report of the robbery was
dispatched to the city, and they
were on their way. We were listen-
ing to the city police‘s calls and just

The Pitt News, April 9, 1986

within seconds of the call. We
waited for the city police to arrive
and then proceeded to go back on
patrol. Within about one minute. a
description was broadcast over the
radio, and we were keeping an eye
out for the guy.

It was then that the univcrsity‘s
detectives spotted a man matching
the description. We went back to
pick up this suspect. As it turned
out, he matched the description ex-
cept for one item.

The one thing I have noticed is
the fact that campus police do not
lead the lives of television police.
Oakland is a very lively place. and
according to most police, it is a
city in itself.

begins to rely on this as a source
of self—worth.

But buliinics cannot rely on the
binge-purge cycle and the praise of
others for their weight if they are
to lead normal lives. Their world
is unrealistic. and without treat-
ment, destructive.

The Eating Disorders Clinic at
WPlC, which was given a grant to
further research bulimia, is current-
ly conducting a 20—patient program.
In it, the patients are closely mon-
itored in a three—part series. “We
have three components of treat-
ment." said Robin Santhouse. a re-
search associate working with Hsu.
“The patients are sent to a dietician,
then given psychotherapy and then
medication.“ _

program has put WPIC in a special

country ~ in New York and Min-
nesota — are using similar drug
treatments. Lithium, the medication
being utilized at WPIC, was select-
ed for its few side effects and anti-
depressant characterists. “Lithium
tends to stabilize.“ said Santhouse.
“It cuts down on the mood swings
between the binging and purging.“

In his psychotherapy sessions.
Hsu emphasizes regulating food in-
take, teaching how not to binge and
stress management.

With a recovery success rate of
70 percent, Hsu believes that peo-
ple can be cured of bulimia if they
have the desire. But he admitted
that many women don't seek treat-
ment because they think they can
“do it on their own, osare afraid
to admit their weakness."

students mention a“ number or reasons.
They say that students who attend class
full time pay a basic ﬂat rate, as op-
posed to paying on a per-credit basis,
and often are already saving themselves
money. Another argument is that no
one has to take a film studies course.
In other words, if you don’t have the
extra money, don’t take the course.
Again, Dean Schulman disagrees.
According to Schulman, the amount of
money needed to pay the students’ fees
is approximately $10,000 per year.
That becomes a worthwhile invest-
ment, in Schulman‘s eyes, when you
consider the fact that it might end up

V paying for itself in the future.

“If we had a closer relationship with
Film Makers, we would probably be
attracting students that we don’t now
get. They would be interested in com-
ing to Pitt just to get involved in a really
exciting film studies program," argued
Schulman. “We’re not talking about a
lot of money here, all it would take is
four or ﬁve extra students coming to

Pitt because they have a strong film
studies program to pay off that

“It can only be detrimen-

about it. It ’s not going to
make us any richer if Pitt

think it would be more fair to
the students. ”

—— Brady Lewis
Director,

Filmmaking Dept.
Pittsburgh Film Makers

While on several different occasions
it has appeared that the university was
going to take action to change their
present policy, that change never
materialized.

“We had been told that it would be
cleared up during the summer,” Lewis
said. “And apparently the way it was
cleared up was a decision to continue
the policy as it exists."

So the problem remains. The
students don’t feel that the university
cares about them enough to change the
situation. Pittsburgh Film Makers wait.
trapped by an inability to affect Pitt‘s
policy on one side, and by their
students, being treated unfairly on the
other. Schulman sees the potential at
Pitt for a nationally prominent film
studies program, but thinks the double
tuition is an obstacle to getting that kind
of a program started. This situation has
existed at Pitt for several years now.
and while the end is not right around
the corner, there is hope. It will prob-
ably depend on the students. on their
desire to demonstrate the need for a
change in policy. They should take
heart in the knowledge that there are
a lot of people, both university-
affiliated and otherwise. who agree
with them.

Men’s tennis

Sports

hes nd from early season slump

  

Dave Johnson

File photo/The Pitt

By Gregg Fieery
Staff Writer

The Pitt men’s tennis team crushed
the Carnegie-Mellon Tartans 9-0 on
Monday afternoon atTrees Courts.
The win evened their record at 7-7.

“I feel like Custer watching the In-
dians circle around," said CMU coach
Pete Hawk as he watched his No. 1 and
2 players drop their first sets in less
than one half—hour to Pitt’s Jeff
Dadowski and Neil Meyerowich,
respectively. Hawk had good reason to
be concerned, as none of his players,
of which ﬁve of six were freshmen,
were faring any better.

At No. 3, Pitt's Greg Campbell won
his first set 6-0 and, with the match
well in hand, decided that it was a good
time to experiment with his strategy.
“I’m usually a baseliner, but I needed
work on my serve and volley,” said
Campbell following the match. The
result was much the same, though, as
the sophomore went on to a 6-2 second-
set margin.

The Panthers rounded out singles
play with solid performances and
straight-set victories by Rich
Monteleone. Jeff LaFuria and Chuck
De Vera.

In the meantime. No. 1 player Jeff
Dadowski continued topommel his ob-

viously less experienced opponent into
submission, playing a fine-tuned,
powerful game with relaxed con-
fidence. At one point, after dodging a
barrage of consecutive serves without
managing a single return, the weary
Tartan victim proceded to ask his

“Right now, we’re far
ahead of where I thought
we ’d be. Everybody ’s been
working hard, and we're
peaking at the right time. ”

— George Dieﬂenbach

coach, “How do you return a
thousand-mile-an-hour serve?" There
seemed to be no reasonable reply.
Dadowski rolled on to a 6-1, 6-1
victory.

Meyerowich, on the other hand,
showed why he bears the brunt of his
teammates‘ jests for taking the full
three sets to ﬁnish his matches. After
the impressive first set. the left—handed
freshman seemed to have difficulty
controlling his strong strokes and drop-

5

The Pitt News, April 9, 1986

ped the second set 6-2. As he often
does, though. Meyerowich recovered
and fought to a 6-3 final set margin.

Doubles play saw more of the same
Panther dominance, as Pitt teams lost
a combined total of only 10 games in 3
three matches.

With his team having won four of
their past five matches, Pitt coach
George Dieffenbach is very pleased
with the Panthers’ .500 record, as well
as their progress at this point in the
season. The team is focusing in on
another winning season. Pitt men's ten-
nis teams have had only one losing
season in the past nine years under his
guidance.

“Right now, we’re far ahead of
where I thought we’d be,” said Dief-
fenbach. “Everybody's been working -
hard, and we’re peaking at the right
time.”

In regard to his method of schedul-
ing, Dieffenbach said, “It’s really
pointless to pad our schedule with easy
matches to pile up wins. It helps
nobody. I try to balance the schedule
so we can shoot for a winning season."

With four matches remaining, the
next three of which are at home, the
Panthers appear to be on their way.

Notes: Pitt will host Allegheny Col-
lege today at 3:30 p.m. and
Youngstown State tomorrow at 3 p.m.

Night scrimmage prepares Panthers for opener

This Friday night's scrimmage game
in nearby Belle Vernon provides Pitt
with the opportunity to continue to

been occuring this spring.

Head coach Mike Gottfried is look-

become more consistent. “Our objec-

game at Pitt Stadium. The game will
be nationally televised by ESPN. Pitt
opened ESPN‘s college football season
last year with a 31-30 victory over
Purdue.

Gottfried sees nothing but positive
effects coming from the Maryland
game. “I really think it’s a great honor.
I‘m happy for the university,“ Gott-
fried said. “It’s a great thing for our
program.“

Since Pitt's first game has been
moved from Sept. 6 to Sept. 1, the Pan-
thers will be able to open summer camp
earlier, something that more than
pleases Gottfried and his assistants.
“We get to go to camp earlier, and
that's great," Gottfried said.

Pitt's spring practices have been go-
ing well thus far, according to Gott-
fried. “There have not been any sur-
prises. It‘s went about the way I
thought it would go," said an obviously
pleased Gottfried. “I'm pleased at the
way the kids have handled the transi-
tion. I‘ve said it all along that the tran-
sition is more difficult for the players
than for the coaches."

As it looks now. the quarterback der-
by is being won by fifth—_vear senior
John Congemi. Congemi was im-
pressive in Satui‘dLi_v morning‘s scrim-
in;ige_ throwing for over 100 )'.ll‘Li\.
Altlioiigli (‘ongemi has outshoxvn
junior college transfer Sal Genilla this
spritig. Genilla is. still on top of Gott-
fried‘s depth chart.

Led by the defensive line. the de-
fense has been impressive throughout
spring practices thus far. They appear
to be developing the consistency that
Gottfried is striving for. If the offense
can join them, Pitt may well be con-
sistent for the first time in over three
seasons.

Commenting on the spring, Gottfried
said. “I couldn’t be happier right
now."

Brookin shines at Roundball

By John Enright
Staff Writer

Despite being sick with the tin,
Brookin. it 6-6 small liorwanl. plziyetl
for the Peiitisylvariizi All-Stars in the
final game olthe Roundball’s first ever
triple—header, Sunday afternoon at the
Civic Arena.

Brookin not only played in the game.
he went out and scored l6 points, win-
ning the Most Valuable Player award
for his squad, which lost to the United
States Eastern All-Stars, 98-96.

Brookin‘s award marked the second
time in the past three years a Pitt player
has received MVP for the Pennsylvania
team. In 1984 former Panther guard
Junie Lewis won the award with an
awesome 28 point performance in a
losing effort against the U.S. All-Stars,
a squad that included current Panther
players Charles Smith and Demetreus
Gore.

Brookin was pleased with the award.
but wasn't sure he earned it. " I think

ltitiiiiil tlesewetl the tlwtirtl.“ \2lltl
Brooltin. “He pl;l_\Ctl ii g_ii'e;it tlttlllt‘ ltil‘

For the game, “Roeltet" lirooltiii
finished w itli four rebounds. (WU 11551515
and two steals, to go along with his lb
points.

As is the case with all talented
players, Brookin wasn't pleased with
his performance. “I played well the
second half. but I could have done a
whole lot better in the first half,“ added
Brookin.

Although he didn't play a great
game, Brookin had his moments: He
is a strong player (225 pounds) and he
fits into the Adrian Dantley mold. He
has a feathery touch 16 feet from the
basket and some nice moves to the
hoop.

Brookin doesn't appear to have
“superstar" talent. but he could
definitely become a steady Big East
perfomier for the Panthers. Pitt should
be happy to have him, And naturally
Brookin is happy to have Pitt.

As I see it

rage I /

By Jim Brueckner

Hard work will pay off for new Pirate boss Syd Thrift

()nce upon a time. there lived two
men named George and Syd. Both men
were involved in the same line of work.
with George holding a higher position
in his company than Syd held in his.
But there were people who felt that
George could’ve learned a lot from
Syd.

These two men had a very different
way of looking at life. Syd was a man
of thoroughness and patience. George
was very impatient. always looking for
shortcuts.

This could easily be noted from any
daily activity.

Take for instance. the “porch
swing" incident. Both men were look-
ing to install swings on their back
porches. Their intentions seemed
similar until you closely examined the
different methods used to research their
ends.

Syd, being the thorough man that he
was. decided that if he was going to
have a really dependable porch swing.
it would be worth the time and effort
to build it himself.

George, on the other hand. did the

same thing as always. He threw his
money around. always wanting some-
one else to do all the work. while he
reaped the rewards. George bought

(‘\‘(’I‘_\'I/Ifllg. He hated the idea of

building anything himself.

He was however. very unhappy very
often. because he bought a lot of defec-
tive goods. But he had no one to blame
but himself; because he was just plain
too lazy. His was a quest of always
buying success. He did purchase it on
occasion. But more often than not. he
was only buying heartache.

Syd took time with his porch swing.
He went to a lumber yard and traded
with the man there for some fine pieces

, of lumber that he thought could one day

build a fine porch swing.

Syd called a few ofhis friends over.
and they began to work on the swing.
It was their job to take these rough
pieces of lumber, put them together in
the proper combination and create a
swing that would be the envy of the
neighborhood.

Well, of course George had his

swing long before Syd had his. but
trouble was on the horizon. ()ne bright
and sunny day, George was sitting on
his swing, watching Syd work on his
in his backyard. George began to brag
how he had "the best swing money
could buy" and Syd was only going to
have a cheap homemade swing when-
ever he finished.

George began to laugh loudly. And
just as he leaned back, the swing came
crashing down, with George feeling
\'¢'r_\' embarrassed. Syd just smiled and
went back to work.

Meanwhile, George jumped up
screaming, blaming everyone in sight
for his poor misfortune. He blamed the
mailman. He blamed the milktnan. He
blamed his dog. He blamed everyone
except himself. He wasn’t very
popular. as you can well imagine.

Occasionally. Syd found that a cer-
tain board didn't fit just right. But in-
stead of flying off the handle like
George. he just chalked it up to ex-
perience and went out to get a new
board to replace it.

Syd could never understand George.

He had always tried to tell George that
the only way that a porch swing would
last would be ifGeorge built it himself.
Syd didn‘t believe in trusting the
workmanship of others.

Still. George refused to change. He
was as irrational as ever. When he went
to work the next day. he fired William.
his best employee. William was one of
the best that his field had ever pro-
duced. yet George fired him. and it
wasn‘t the first time. William had been
fired and rehired a number of times.

Syd always respected the opinions of
his friends when they were building the
swing. If one of them suggested that
Syd was improperly using one of the
boards and wanted him to try it in a
new position. Syd agreed to try it.
George, on the other hand, never
listened to anybody’s ideas but his own.
He thought that he knew everything
about everything. He was always try-
ing to tell everybody that he knew their
job better than they did. This was
especially a recurring problem with
William.

Truth be known, George didn‘t know
half of what William knew.

As time went by, Syd's porch swing
began to show more and more promise.
All of the various pieces of lumber
were beginning to come together faster
than anyone had ever imagined. Syd
was sure to tell everyone not to expect
too much too soon, but expressed op-
timism for the future.

George continued to go out and buy
swings each time the old ones fell
apart. Unknowingly. because of his lust
for immediate success. George had
bought swings with a lot of very old
and decaying pieces of wood. And each
time another piece would fall off, he
would curse loudly and again blame
everyone but his impatient self.

Syd has put a lot of time and work
into his porch swing, while George has
just spent a lot of money covering up
past mistakes.

Remember, you heard it here first.
Syd's swing, which he nicknamed
“The Pirates,” will be more efficient
this year than George's, which he
nicknamed “The Yankee.”

In a time when most college athletes
confuse the order of the phrase
“student—athlete, ” emphasizing the lat-
ter, Brian Lohman is an‘ individual with
his priorities straight. A member of
Pitt’s baseball team, he's a young man
who believes that discipline is the key
on and off the playing ﬁeld and that
keeping the role of education foremost
doesn’t mean you sacriﬁce anything.

When Lohman first came to Pitt as
a freshman last year, he juggled the
roles of being a punter on the football
team and a left.-fielder for the baseball
team. The combination of the two
sports, plus a major in business, pro-
duced more pressure than Lohman
wanted. Now his concentration is on
baseball, his first love, even though
football was his reason for coming to
Pitt.

“Looking back, ifI would‘ve had an
offer for baseball out of high school,

1 wotild‘vc gone,“ said Loliiiizm.
“Since l tlidn‘t. l decided to come to
Pitt for football it was a personal
challenge. But my dad always told me:
‘You can’t play two sports in college.‘
and for me that’s so true."

But Lohman doesn't regret his deci-
sion about walking on in football
because according to him, “It helped
build character. ” And Lohman’s char-
acter is one of his finest attributes.

“Brian is one of the more mature
players in the ball club.“ noted Pitt's
head baseball coach Bobby Lewis. “He
came in last year, earned the left—field
starting position and did an incredible
job.” Off the field, Lewis thinks just
as highly of Lohman. “He’s a student-
athlete," he said, “and also a gentle-
man."

Lohman’s decision to give up foot-
ball turned out to be a smart one. It not
only eased the pressure on him, but it
benefited Pitt baseball as well. When
the team returned from their annual
spring ball in Florida a few weeks ago.
Lohman led the team in batting. and
since the start of the Big East schedule.

Discipline means success for Pitt’s Lohman

‘lie is still going strong.

Recalling his cliiltlliood, Loliman
credits his six brothers and their interest
in sports for inlluencing him. As the
youngest of l l children, he remembers
how watching his brothers made him
compete.

And ifever he felt pressure, Lohman
points out that it came from within

— rather than from anyone else, including

his father. “I was fortunate because my
dad never pushed sports," said
Lohman. “Instead, he was a good
motivator."

In his senior year of high school, the
motivation definitely took effect.
Lohman describes it as his best year in
baseball - and the point where base-
ball became something serious for him.

That summer, Lohman went to try-
out camps for the Yankees and Royals.
The Royals, at the end of each sum-
mer, invite the best players from each
tryout camp for an intersquad game,
and for two consecutive years Lohman
was invited to play.

Aside from school, baseball has
become an important part of Lohman‘s
life. In fact. he often thinks about what
it would be like to play pro ball. And
it's not far-fetched or strictly wishful
thinking.

l.ewis thinks that Lohman has all the
ingredients iiiaior leagues look for.
“Hc‘s a more disciplined hitter now.“
said Lewis. “He hits with good power,
has good speed and a strong arm. With
a good spring and summer. he'll be a
prospect."

A prospect or not. Lohman decided
that he would like to go on to graduate
school for a master‘s in business simply
because of his interest in business,
regardless of baseball.

As for what he's learned since play-
ing at Pitt. Lohman credits the coaching
staff for teaching him more about the
game mentally and about being an in-
dividual. A team player by nature, he
also gives credit to his teammates, who
he describes as “great guys," for pro-
viding a relaxed atmosphere.

This summer Lohman's usual en-
vironment will change drastically. He
plans on going to Alaska to play in a
semi-professional baseball league
called the Alaskan League because
there is more opportunity for recogni-
tion and to be viewed by pro scouts.

But it's really not surprising that
Lohman will be going there. After all.
he always seems to be moving in an up-
ward direction.

The Pitt News, April 9, 1986 :

Baseball team remains in slump

By Teresa Varley
For The Pitt News

It is said that behind every cloud
there is a silver lining. Right now, Pitt
baseball coach Bobby Lewis might
have a little trouble convincing himself
of that. But. after taking a look at the
way the Panthers played on Sunday.
Lewis realizes that the statement might
be true.

Despite the fact that the Panthers lost
to Villanova 3-2 in the ﬁnal game of
a three-game series, there were still
some bright spots.

“Sunday’s game was the best-
pitched game we have had all season,”
Lewis said. “We gave up only one
walk. It seems like in all of our games,
whenever we walk somebody, they end
up scoring."

Junior Keith Shuster was the one
responsible for the Panthers strong
outing on the mound. Shuster went the
distance for the Panthers, giving up
nine hits and one walk.

Defensively, the Panthers made a
strong turnaround in the game also.
Lewis changed the starting lineup, in-
serting freshmen Mike Claus at short-
stop. Neil Roach in right ﬁeld. Jay
Duderstadt as the designated hitter and
junior Alan Popa at second base.

"We made some nice plays in the
field." Lewis said. "Alan Popa played
very well and so did Mike Claus. Mike
looked real good out there. He did not
look nervous at all.

“It was an important game for us
because we did not beat ourselves with
mistakes. We made them beat us.
which is something we have not been
doing." continued Lewis.

For a while it looked like the Pan-
thers were going to win the game. In
the ﬁrst inning. Popa hit a solo homer
to left-center and Brian Lohman hit one
to right—center. scoring the Panthers
only two mns. While the defensive was
keen, the Panthers were only able to
get three more hits, one each by Matt
Stennett. Dave Westwood and John
Brush.

Villanova went ahead, 3-2, in the
ﬁfth inning, but despite a strong ninth
inning effort. the Panthers just weren‘t
able to regain the lead they had in the
early going.

The Panthers gave the Wildcats a run
for their money in Saturday's double-
header also. In the ﬁrst game. Matt
Stennett led off the ﬁrst inning with a
home run. The Panthers scored another
run in the fourth. when Dave West-
wood went home on a wild pitch. The
Panthers were down 3-2 going into the
seventh when they scored three runs.
Rich Deily walked and was knocked
home on Don Fausnaught‘s double.
Then Westwood came up and hit a two-
run homer to right ﬁeld._ Villanova
came back and tied the game. forcing
it into extra innings. In the bottom of
the ninth. Lewis pulled one out of his
hat. and used Claus as a ﬁfth inﬁelder.
With the bases loaded and nobody out,
the Panthers were able to prevent one
run from scoring with the extra in-
ﬁelder. But. unfortunately for the Pan-
thers. the next batter hit one to short-
stop Gregg Lamanti. who after ﬁelding
the ball. bobbled it, allowing the win-
ning run to score.

“We were hoping it would work out
with the extra inﬁelder," Lewis said.
“It was a move that Branch Richey
used in the 19505. We pulled the
rightﬁelder because ifa ﬂy ball was hit
there. the runner would have been able
to score anyway. It did work out the
way we wanted. but we weren‘t able
to execute it."

Mike Shannon started the game, giv-
ing up four hits. ﬁve runs. four walks
and two strikeouts. Frank Craska
pitched two strong innings of relief,
despite the fact that he was the losing
pitcher.

In the second game of the double-
header, Lohman struck again. With
Stennett on third, Fausaaught on sec-
ond and Westwood on ﬁrst, Lohman
hit one over the right ﬁeld fence to give
the Panthers a 4-2 lead. Villanova
chopped away at the Panthers‘ lead,
scoring one in the fourth and three in
the ﬁfth off starter Rich Gavran. In a

controversial move, the umpires called
the game because ofdarkness after 7 ‘/2
innings, making the final score 6-4.

After playing 13 of the first 14 games
on the road. the Panthers begin a long
homestand beginning today with a I
p.m. double-header against West-
minster. The Panthers host Big East op-
ponent Seton Hall in a 12 p.m. double-
header Saturday and a single game at
noon on Sunday.

PANTHERS NOTEBOOK: In the
Big East statistics, right fielder Jim
Leitera is seventh in the conference
with a .417 batting average and second

baseman Don Fausnaught is ninth with
a .375 average. Brian Lohman leads
the conference with three home runs.
Overall he has a team high four
homers. '

Lohman is leading the team in
overall hitting with a .347 average. He
leads the team with I2 RBIs and is tied
with Matt Stennett for a team high four
doubles. Leitera is second in overall
hitting with a .304 average.

On the mound. Keith Shuster is
leading the team with an overall ERA
of 3.97. He is tenth in the conference
with a 3.46 ERA. Mike Shannon leads
the team in strikeouts with 14.
