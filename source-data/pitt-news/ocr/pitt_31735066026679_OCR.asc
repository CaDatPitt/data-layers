Allegheny County coroner and author speculates on murder

Assistant News Edltor

Patsy Ramsey cried after
she discovered her daughter
JonBenet had been kidnapped,
according to police reports.
But officers didn’t see any
tears dripping from her eyes,
and thought they caught her
peeking at them to see if they
were watching.

Police later discovered
that the chair Patsy Ramsey
sat in as she cried was one
floor directly above the room
where six—year-old JonBenet’s
body lay hidden.

Many of the details of
JonBenet Ramsey’s death are
hazy and bizarre, so much so
that a year and a half after her
death -her killer remains at

Charles Bosworth Jr. of the St.

findings. Wecht spoke about
the case and autographed
copies of his book at the cam-
pus bookstore last Thursday.
As a solution to the
crime, he concluded that
JonBenet Ramsey was acci-
dentally killed during a sex
game gone awry. ‘ »
Crime scene photos
showed that somebody tied a
rope around JonBenet’s neck
and right wrist, and wound a
splintered stick of wood —- a
broken piece of one of her
mother’s paintbrushes — into
the rope around her neck.
Wecht determined that the
rope had been tied too loosely

Pitt researcher announces
possible AIDS prevention

Jason Gatlinger

Assistant News Edltor

A Pitt researcher said he may
have found a way to teach the
human body to recognize, attack
and kill the virus that causes AIDS.

Charles Rinaldo, Ph.D., told
the 12th Annual AIDS Conference
in Geneva Monday that it is possi-
ble to increase the strength of den-
dritic cells in a person’s immune
system. The dendritic cells could
then teach T-cells, which kill dis-
eases, to seek out and kill HIV, he
said.

Dendritic cells are most com-
monly found on the skin and in
mucous membranes. When a den-

gdritic cell encounters a foreign

substance, it learns to recognize

that substance and directs disease-

fighting cells to it.

According to Rinaldo, once T-
cells learn to recognize HIV as a
substance that must be destroyed,

they could seek out the virus and
kill it.

In the past, Rinaldo has
reported removing dendritic cells
from HIV-positive patients and
exposing the cells to the virus and
a concentrated dose of interleukin-
12 -— immune system cells that
stimulate the growth and aggres-
sion of disease-fighting cells. The
dendritic cells reacted when con-
fronted with HIV under those con-
ditions, he said.

Research of the technique,
funded by the National Institutes
of Health, will begin soon at the
Graduate School of Public Health.
Researchers will first test mon-
keys, and if these tests are success-
ful, human trials could begin in
one or two years.

In the upcoming trials,
Rinaldo said he will test two meth-
ods ‘of manipulating dendritic

THE P111 News

Pitt News in brief

Pitt trustees
approve PAT
proposal

Pitt’s board of trustees approved a
plan that will allow students to ride
Port Authority buses by simply show-
ing their ID cards.

The board voted to increase stu-
dents’ security, safety and transporta-
tion fee by $18 at its meeting last
Thursday. The increase will bring the
fee to $55 per semester for both full-
and part-time students.

Students voted during the spring
semester to endorse the proposal.

Pitt will use the additional money
to pay the Port Authority to let students
ride buses and light—rail vehicles any-
where in Allegheny County by show-
ing their ID cards.

Now Port Authority’s board of
directors must approve the plan.

Pitt spokesman Ken Service said
the University fully expects the Port
Authority’s board to endorse the plan,
with approval likely by late July.

With Port Authority’s endorse-
ment, the plan should be implemented

by the begimiing of the fall semester, _

Service said.

He renewed his caution that the
plan is just a one—year experiment. If
problems develop — for instance, not
enough students take advantage of the
plan to justify the cost — it could be
terminated. If no problems develop,
Pitt will renew the service beyond the
initial one-year period.

Port Authority buses will soon
have a fresh look to go along with the
new service. PAT is replacing the red
and white paint scheme in use since
1964 with solid metallic gold.

The new paint scheme is part of
Port Authority’s “Gold Standard of
Service,” under which PAT will strive
to improve customer service, accord-
ing to Port Authority Executive
Director Paul Skoutelas.

All new buses will be delivered in
the new paint scheme. Port Authority
will repaint older buses when they are
scheduled for heavy maintenance.

Minibuses working in Port
Authority’s new Monroeville subur-
ban service already wear the new
color. ‘ ‘

Computer server
down

Pitt’s computer server broke
down yesterday, preventing students

from logging on to the system, cutting
them off from the University’s home
page and e-mail access.

UNIX access was denied around
3:30 p.m. and was still not up as of
10:30 p.m.

Pitt’s department of Computing
and Information Services said it didn’t
know what the problem was and
wouldn’t be able to address it until
today.

Nobody answered the 4—HELP
line at CIS last night for further inquiry
about the system’s problems.

Computer ports
ahead of schedule,
under budget

The University announced
Thursday it will complete the installa-
tion of computer ports in all campus
dormitory rooms this fall -— under
budget and a year ahead of schedule.

“We are deﬁnitely ahead of
schedule” said Jinx Walton , director
of ‘Support Services, the department in
charge of the project. “It was thought
this wouldn’t be done until September
of ‘99.”

Originally, the project’s comple-
tion was scheduled for September of
1999 at a cost of $2 million. However,
the 1999 budget lists the actual cost at
$1,507,111 -— approximately 75 per-
cent of the ﬁrst estimate.

The project has been completed
in all three of the Towers, Lothrop Hall
and part of Sutherland Hall, with 2,600
ports installed. Wiring in the remain-
ing dorms will be ﬁnished before the
fall semester.

The wiring configuration is
designed to accommodate one com-
puter port per person in each room.

The new system, called the ether-
net, will allow students direct access to
the Internet without having to use a
modem. The ethemet is about 300
times faster than a modem. Not all
computers are equipped for ethemet
connections.

Pitt’s ethemet server will be capa-
ble of accommodating all the students
on campus at once.

A 24-hour help desk will be open
beginning Aug. 3 to aid students with
problems. A

In addition, 25 resident consul-
tants will be available for students with
computer problems that require assis-
tance in their rooms.

Each resident consultant will’
‘have ofﬁce hours and be on call

through the help desk.

THE P111 NEws

WEDNESDAY, 1 jun 1998

WECHT

The rope was intended to
reduce the flow of oxygen to
JonBenet’s brain, a state known as
hypoxia, according to Wecht.
People have been known to tie ropes
around their necks to create an
effect where the decreasing flow of
oxygen to the brain increases sensa-
tion during masturbation, a state
known as auto-erotic asphyxiation.

According to Wecht, whoever
tied JonBenet would have slowly
turned the piece of wood like a
tourniquet, gradually reducing the
ﬂow of oxygen to her brain. The
person tightening the rope, he said,

did so to experience a sexual charge,

from watching her suffer — in
effect, experiencing auto—erotic
asphyxiation vicariously through
JonBenet. ‘

The vagus nerve, through
which the brain regulates the func-
tions of many internal organs,
including the heart and lungs, runs
through the neck. Wecht claimed
that whoever killed JonBenet acci-
dentally tightened the rope too
much, pinching the vagus nerve and
causing her heart and lungs to slow
and eventually stop.

The autopsy report showed
bruising on JonBenet’s brain that
Wecht said was consistent with
somebody shaking her in attempt to
wake her, as if surprised by her sud-
den loss of consciousness.

The report also showed bruises

FROM PAGE 1

on JonBenet’s genitals and on her
vaginal wall, which Wecht said indi-
cate sexual_ abuse over a period of
time.

Some of the vaginal wall tissue
had eroded, a sign Wecht said points
to repeated molestation. The autop-
sy report also indicated fresh bleed-
ing, which he said
indicated sexual
abuse the night of
JonBenet’s death.

Wecht said
the bruises on
JonBenet’s geni-
talia could have
only come from
sexual abuse. The
bruising was not
consistent with
penile penetra-
tion, he said. And
the notion that the
bruising had an
innocent explana-
tion is preposter-
ous, he said.

“This was
the wintertime —
she wasn’t_riding
a horse,” he said.

H a P d
J onBenet’s death been a simple
murder, Wecht said, there would
have been no need for the piece of
wood wound into the rope to tighten
it. ~
“She had a neck the size of a

good-sized bantam rooster,” he said.
In other words, any adult could have
strangled her with bare hands.

As far as anybody is aware,
according to police reports, only
three other people were in the
Ramsey house the night of the mur-
der: her parents and her nine—year-
old brother, Burke.

There were no footprints found
in the snow outside the house to
suggest the pres-
ence of an intruder,
Wecht said.

“There is not
a scintilla of hard
evidence in the
house to suggest
that anybody else
was present,” he
said. The police
found no finger-
prints or hairs
belonging to any-
body besides the
Ramseys and their
close acquain-
tances, hessaid.
With no evi-
dence to suggest
an intruder, Wecht
believes John and
Patsy Ramsey
must have been
- involved in their
I daughter’s death. V
“Mix this all in your pot and
this is the porridge you must ulti-
mately ingest” if you are to believe
an intruder committed the crime,
Wecht said.

LOANS

even more money, the Education
Department said.

Banks have criticized the lower
rate, saying it is not profitable
enough for their businesses.

Jane Glickman, spokeswoman
for the Education Department,
refused to release names of banks
who oppose the lower rate.

A Treasury Department analy-
sis indicates that the Clinton
administration could take steps to
address the lenders’ concerns.

The administration, for exam-
ple, is proposing a plan to elimi-
nate unnecessary costs to lenders

' by changing the formula for setting

the interest rate so that it more
closely tracks lenders’ own financ-

ing practices. _

The administration’s proposal
for the reauthorization of HEA will
include modernizing loan programs
by making them simpler and more
efficient, thus reducing lender
costs and keeping the business of
making student loans profitable.

The administration’s proposal
also includes reducing the number
of rules that banks have to operate
under.

“Our goal is to preserve sav-
ings for borrowers striving to fur-
ther their education, while offering
lenders a reasonable return and
protecting taxpayers at the same A
time,” said U.S Secretary of
Education. Richard W. Riley.

cells. .

One method involves removing
dendritic cells from a patient’s
body. In a laboratory, researchers
will boost the cells’ ability to recog-
nize diseases. The cells will then be
injected back into the patient’s
body.

The alternative method
involves boosting dendritic cells’
abilities while they are in a patient’s
body. To accomplish that,
researchers will inject the dendritic
cells with DNA from HIV.

Rinaldo said he hopes the
process of altering dendritic cells
will be able to serve as a single,
standard treatment for HIV infec-
tion. _

Even if his treatment is not
strong enough to be used alone,
Rinaldo said it could be effectively
used in conjunction with current
HIV treatments to increase their
sucess.

. HIV patients are « presently
treated with a combination of drugs,
as many as 18 different medications
a day. Many of the drugs have
restrictions — some must be taken
with food or after hours of fasting,

‘and some must be taken at specific

times. In addition, drug therapy is
extremely expensive.

The combination drug therapy
has reduced HIV to almost unde-
tectable levels in some patients, but
not all patients have responded well
or at all. . L

If a patient undergoing both
therapies were to miss a dose of
medication, the specialized dendrit-
ic cells in the patient’s immune sys-
tem could cover the lapse, Rinaldo
said. The dendritic cells could also
help a patient fight HIV if he or she
developed an immunity to the drugs
or simply stopped taking them, he
said. '

If the combination of drug and
dendritic cell therapies totally elim-
inated HIV from a patient’s body,
the dendritic cells might help to
keep the patient immune to HIV in
the future, Rinaldo said.

Until the precise efficacy of
Rinaldo’s treatment is known, he
has proposed using it in conjunction
with drug therapies on the grounds
that HIV infection must be fought
by all available means.

It's a repor’s ibo red

  

the news — not make it up

A reporter’s job is to
report and chronicle events as
they happen, not create the
news or components of it.

The Cincinnati Enquirer
made a front-page apology
Monday to the Chiquita
banana company, after reporter
Mike Gallagher unethically
obtained information by steal-
ing the company’s voice mail.

A week earlier, the
American Society of
Newspaper Editors withdrew
the 1998 Distinguished
Writing Award it awarded to
Patricia Smith, who admitted
she fabricated people and quo-
tations in her column in the
Boston Globe..

On Monday, CNN hired
First Amendment expert Floyd
Abrams to examine the accura-
cy of the controversial report
that alleged U.S. commandos
used nerve gas on American
defectors in Laos during the
Vietnam War.

In this information age,
speed and the desire to out-
scoop the competition appear
to be the motivating factors
behind the media, which
invariably leads to stories
where research is not a prime
factor, editing is rushed and

unnamed sources become sta-
ples.

It is inevitable that once in
a while a journalist will get a
fact or a story wrong. But
feverish competition does not
mean that this error is excus-
able.

There have been several
incidents lately involving
questionable journalistic
integrity (Monica Lewinsky’s
fictitious semen-covered dress
in the Dallas Morning News
article that started the whole
scandal back in January being
one of the more notable). If a
story doesn’t click the way it
should, or is not spicy enough,
reporters have to bite the bullet
and look elsewhere. Journalists
should not be making up the
facts.

It is also up to the irre-
sponsible reporters to admit
their mistakes. Journalists have
an obligation to be truthful and
responsible —— they should
never create the news, only
relay it from the newsmakers
to the newsreaders.

If a reporter makes a mis-
take, the media’s consumers
have every right to criticize.

Feel free to shoot the mes-
senger if the messenger lies.

Primary system high in futility factor

A few weeks ago, the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania and its descendants of William
Penn’s “noble experiment” committed their
votes and time to elect —— several people I’ve
never heard of. A

For the Democratic nomination race for
governor, thousands of Democrats across the
state asked on.May 19 just who the hell Ivan
Itkin was. In the ﬁrst U.S. Congressional
district in Philadelphia, thousands more
wondered aloud why they were voting for
some guy named Bob Brady. And so on
across the state.

To be honest, I don’t blame them. It took
a small bit of research to find that Ivan Itkin
is the former state representative
from Pittsburgh who was chosen
to be -— as the Philadelphia
Inquirer put it — the Democratic
“sacrificial lamb” against
Governor Tom Ridge in the
November elections. p

Bob Brady (who is only important on the
eastern half of the state) was elected as the
Democratic replacement for former
Representative Thomas Foglietta, who
became U.S. Ambassador to Italy.

As to the reason why hardly anyone
knew this, chalk it up to the primary system.
To use an" example, a primary is the political
version of the All-Star Game, where a few
votes by people motivated enough to send in
their ballots decide who you’re going to see
play months later.

And it’s just as easy to manipulate.
Think of what would happen if the mayors
of Pittsburgh and Philadelphia got everyone
in their cities to vote for their players to be
the starters. Would people pay to see
Pennsylvania versus the American League?

As to the reason why more people have
no idea who represents them, it’s not neces-
sarily because of lack of coverage or voter
interest...well, actually it is.

Until the few days before a primary, you
would be hard—pressed to ﬁnd anyone out-
side of the candidate’s immediate families
that know they are running. Aunt Selma,
who has nothing else to do with her time
except wrestle the other retirees in her nurs-
ing home for portions of Crackling Oat Bran
and Metamucil, is the only one in the family
who knows what cousin Jimmy is up to these
days. ‘

Another problem with the primary sys-
tem is that those in the same party must
stump against each other for the “honor” of
representing their party in November.
Therefore, on an imaginary ticket, several
people who theoretically stand for the same
issues have to try and differentiate them-
selves from their “fellow” opponents.

If Candidate A offered the moon to his
constituents, the next would wager the Sun
and Mercury, and the last would see their
bets and raise ‘em the entire inner solar sys-
tem and the asteroid belt. Like science ﬁc-
tion, politics is no place for reality.

Coupled with these grim issues is the
fact that some voters can be over-
whelmed by the notion that their
votes mean all of doodly—squat.
Being a registered Republican in
an obscenely Democratic city like
Philadelphia means as much as a
warning from a parent to a teenager not to
drink too much while they’re on vacation,
then handing them the key to the liquor cab-
inet.

But even though voting Republican, or
voting at all for that matter, rates quite high
on the futility factor, it gives me a small bit
of pride to think that I am of a select handful
that decided just what shape the elections
will take. .

It also puts me on an ethical level some-
what akin to a conscientious objector, where
I can sit back and laugh at the state of affairs
that someone I didn’t vote for caused.

To be honest, these are lame reasons to
vote. No one seems to give two cents for
civic pride, patriotism or “the never—ending
quest to smash the heathen Communist Red
Menace” like they did in the first half of the
century.

But voting, and the primary system by
extension, is one of the only ways left to
speak one’s mind without uttering a‘ sound.

I In a world frightened by direct confrontation

and lawsuits, the privacy of the voting booth
is a refuge for the besieged citizen who
wishes to speak his or her mind. ,

Or a way of killing ﬁfteen minutes. Take
your pick.

Gerald Bergen made sure that his ﬁrst col-
umn (and probably his last) was kid-tested,
mother-approved.

Point State Park —— the scene: a triangle of
trampled grass catering to patrons and
strangers alike, all roaming about to take part
in the suave happening that is hitting the pave-
ment of downtown Pittsburgh. The patrons are
many, and to try and categorize each would do
nothing more than deviate my eye from keep-
ing score of the scene at hand.

The patrons reach into their book bags and
release an afghan, a nasty blanket of green,_and
browns that reeks of moth balls, and suddenly
a picnic emerges.

The strangers, however, linger. There is no
sense of urgency for these cats as they make
every effort to bring a serving of uneasiness to
the picnickers. When the strangers realize their
success, they move on, seeking isolation in the
shade, most likely to test their newest piece of
paraphernalia.

Naturally, there are other breeds that can
be witnessed amidst this setting. They are nei-
ther the patron nor the stranger, they are the
passersby. They walk sullenly, taking them-
selves entirely too seriously as they look des-
perately into the muddy waters of the river,
waiting for the key of life to be swept ashore
by the wake of some spo1t’s new 35-foot speed
boat.

And of course, there are the few that move
fast with a skip. Their heads bounce up and
down as if they were connected‘ by rubber
bands, just chipper as all hell... (must be the
cotton candy).

This past month, from June 5 through June
21, this stretch of sod and concrete where the
conﬂuence of the “Mon” and the Allegheney
rivers coalesce to form the Ohio river, patrons,
strangers and passersby of all garbs imaginable
were given the opportunity to ﬁll their tanks
with as much music and art as they saw ﬁt.

The Three Rivers Arts Festival was under-
way!

The bustling spirit of craftsmanship and
creativity was dense that particular night; its
thickness almost conquered the bizarre world
of Liberty Avenue that lurked a mere block
around the comer! The ﬁ‘eaks, weirdos, pimps
and prostitutes of Liberty Avenue were no
threat to the players of this set —— a handful of
art enthusiasts and a stockpile of those who
needed “something to do.”

Last Friday, I jived my way into the arts
fest to see what kind of jazz was happening.
The nightfall was stimulating, and I found
myself meandering about with a dear friend
(whose affinity for cancer is greater than that of
art). One, on this type of night, needed only
three things: a sweater, a curious eye and a
vice.

The sweater, to fend oﬂ the cool air that
danced oﬁ the riverfront in search of compan-
ionship. The curious eye, to critique the vari-

ous artists’ works, while keeping sight of the
mysterious doings of mankind. The vice, to
keep these doings ﬁiom bothering you.

I avoided entering the artists’ tents (the
make-do galleries) as long as I could. I made
my round, and discovered that the art on dis-
play was in dire need of some salt. The ﬂavor
of every artist was so predictable and bland
that I began to question why we even have an
arts festival. HOW many cubist, pointalist and
expressionist images can a man stomach
before he gives up the ghost on this concept of
gathering people together to admire and pur-
chase art?

The arrangement of the selection process
to obtain a tent is the reason for such lackluster
art. The festival committee receives various
works (samples) from artists throughout the
country. The submitted creations by each artist
are evaluated by a panel of individuals who
cast votes on what artists are worthy of
receiving the ultimate prize: a venue. ..

G.S. Broz &

Marc Wisnosky

Bust out $1.25, if you will, and
hop on the 84Chi1l. From South
Bouquet to Frazier St., South
Oakland is straight lovin’! To expe-
rience South Oakland in all its glory
is to understand the true urban
neighborhood of Pittsburgh.

Oh ye students who have since‘

relocated to Shadyside or Squirrel
Hill or even North Oakland, we
pose the question: Who is responsi-
ble for putting such foolish ideas in
your heads, thereby possessing you
to live beyond the conﬁnes of the

love of South Oakland?

detractors, but nay-sayers

well-off artists are the ones counting the
money when all is said and done. And let’s
faceit,thatisallthatmatte_rs!

The arts festival has become nothing more
than an avenue for commissioned artists to
make money on the side that in turn yields
nothing more than banal art that the. “J oneses”

_ are just dying to get their paws on.

The only promising element of the arts
festival that salvages any entertainment value
is the music. Give the kids enough time and
I’m sure that too will suffer a slow death.

Kevin Careyis column was not gallery-backed
or commission-funded.

First of all, Uncle Sam’s Subs
may have stores in both South
Oakland and Squirrel Hill, but all
the hot girls work in South
Oakland.

Second, there is a UPMC in
Shadyside, but it’s three times as
big down here.

. Third, we sacriﬁced our bour-
geois supermarket to support small-
er businesses that specialize, such
as Merante’s, Atwood Deli,
Sweetie’s, and the list goes on.

Sure, we have a Rite-Aid much
like North Oakland, but ours is con-

stantly open.

A What we pay in rent for three
people, you pay for one person in
the “alternative” neighborhoods.

“But,” you may say, “We have
nicer loci in which to dwell.” Yes,
but quick to retort, we say, “Where
else can you ﬁnd such quality par-
ties per square block?”

Friends, diversity is key.

What other neighborhood
boasts an Indian, Thai, Middle-
Eastern, Mexican, Japanese, and
Italian restaurant at all, let alone
within three blocks? To add to this,

South Oakland sports the latest 

from the growing community of j
grafﬁti artists, noticeably the mys- j
terious Niser and the elusive 

Onorok.

Lest we forget, we have the 

privilege of being guests to the 
established ethnic contingency of 
our beloved South Oakland. Not a 1

day goes by without one hearing at

least three languages en route to *

one’s destination.

You may keep your Fricks and
Schenleys, for we rely on just one
family for a case of beer, a haircut,
a car repair or whatever our needs
are.

South Oakland is so great, they
even gave us our own Parkway exit.

composed of completely random thoughts.
It’s oddly absorbing. It’s also a great way to
use up all the clever one—liners that I haven’t

are in any way dissatisﬁed, I will gladly
refund you the full purchase price of your
copy of The Pitt News.

This just in: El Nino is gay.

At least, this is the closest I’ve been able

asters are the work of homosexuals.

One could argue that an attempt to list
the “best” of anything is bound to be a sub-
jective judgement. I would gently reply that,
in many cases, the AFI was just plain wrong.

Speaking of just plain wrong, (yeah, the
connections are getting a bit weak here, but
how else am I to work this thought in subtly
and smoothly?) why is it that people sud-
denly forget how to ﬂush the toilet when
they enter a university restroom? It’s yecchy
and gross to open a stall door and be faced
with the biggest piece of ﬂoating crap you’ve
seen since Titanic.

the axe over her head to chop Leo out of his

Ruminations on the effects of malt liquor

alking out of a liquor store

——state-controlled dispenser
of alcoholic beverages — I was
met by a bitch, um, bourgeois mid-
dle—aged woman wearing faux
mink (hey lady, horseskin coats are
not fashionable!) who cast
pompous eyes on my bottle of
Vladimir vodka

She walked past me and my
hombre, who was sitting in the
back of my pickup holding a case
of Schlitz malt liquor that we
bought at Signor Skank’s Beer
Errrporiurn in Wrlkinsburg. (He
cradled the case of forties like a
momma holdin’ a baby.)

This alcoholic snobbery per-
vades Pittsburgh society and pretty
much any society where the liquor
ﬂows. So Schlitz is not Don
Penigrron? So Vladimir comes in a
plastic bottle? Who cares? I derive
maximum utility from my malt
liquor and cheap hooclr

That old hag probably ended
up buying something pretentious,
(ie. a Californian “champagne”).
Yeah, and when she bought it she
probably said something like, “You
know,Idrinkthisﬁnewineonmy
way to work in my Mercedes.”

As for me, I’m all about my
malt liquor. It’s honest, it’s cheap,
and my God, it gives me 100%
dnmken satisfaction!

By JAKE WOIVIER

Armageddon epitomizes the pre-
fab summer blockbuster —-—‘ estab-
lished stars, hot new talent and MTV-
influenced directors all creating a
massively fatal threat. Only the
Everyman can save us.

These days, a summer block-
buster is characterized by big bangs
rather than logic, superﬁcial charac-
ters ratherthan dynamic ones, and a
monstrous budget.

They don't deliver strong characters,

original stories or entertainment.

Although Armageddon offers lit-
tle redemption for the whorish sea-
son, it's busting out to lead the pack.

The story may sound familiar. A
big asteroid is on course to destroy
the earth. A team is assembled to
drill holes into it and blow it to pieces
with nuclear bombs. Supposedly, an
explosion on the outside would bare-
ly make a dent.

In a grand stroke of silliness,
NASA allows the world's premiere

oil-driller,
H a r r y
S t a m p e r
(Bruce Willis), to choose his team of
misﬁts for the mission. I

The primary reason for the ﬁlm's
monetary success will be its talented
cast. While Bruce Vtfillis can numb
your senses in Mercury Rising, he also
turns in strong performances in Pulp
Fiction and Nobody's Fool. His screen
time is short as Harry Stamper. He
shares cameras with multiple charac-
ters and special effects.

' He beneﬁts from not being need-
ed to sustain the audience's interest
alone. Indie star Steve Buscerni steals
scenes with an inspired performance
as Rockhound, a greedy, perverted
genius. At one point, he straddles a
nuclear weapon and rides it like a
mechanical bull, declaring ”I just
wanted to feel the power between my
legs.”

Oddly, Ben Afﬂeck plays the
typical Willis role as a cowboy named
A. J. Frost. Frost always pushes

  
    

things a bit too far— he's the young-
buck tough guy. .

Liv Tyler pulls it all together as
the strong-willed and intelligent
Grace Stamper, Harry's daughter and
A. J.’s ﬁance. She's sending them both
into space, and the odds are not in her
favor of getting them back. Tyler's
performance radiates with expressive
energy. The ﬁlrn’s more emotional
scenes owe their success to her
power. Everybody plays off of her
tangible emotion.

It's amazing that such impres-
sive acting, emerges from Michael

duction of a predictable script.

Nuruddin Farah, recently award-
ed the 1998 Laureate of the Neustadt
International Prize for Literature, was
allowed to reenter hisnative Somalia
in 1996, after 20 years in exile.
"Secrets/’ his latest work, set in 1993
before the onset of civil war, is his ﬁrst
since his return A

Farah’s novel is a fascinating
character study with wonderful poet-
ic prose and a tight, well-structured
plot. ' .
"Secrets" deals with Kalaman, a
Mogadisho-based computer analyst
whose life is complicated when
Sholoongo, a mysterious childhood
friend, returns to Somalia with a
bizarre request: She asks him to
impregnate her because her ﬁre-eating
Moroccan husband is impotent.

Her entrance into his life brings
out a lot of secrets, ‘especially involv-
ing Kalaman’s mother, who accused
Sholoongo of witchcraft 20 years ago.
Sholoongo is alleged to be a
shapeshifter, and was even suspected
of being the elephant who killed
Kalaman’s elephant-poaching friend.
Sholoongo was accused of being a bad
inﬂuence on Kalaman (their teenage
sexual shenanigans are explained in
graphic detail) and seducing
Kalaman’s wise grandfather. -

‘ As the plot thickens, and Somalia
tilts more and more towards anarchy,
secrets that had been buried for the

past 20 years are revealed, threatening J

to turn Kalaman's life upside-down.
Farah, as in previous novels such
as ”Open Sesame,” uses animal
metaphors .—- elephants avenging the
deaths of poached relatives, thieving
honeybadgers, plagues of locusts — to

ﬂlustrate certain themes in the novel, a J

style that has become a trademark of
African writing over the past 50 years.
"Secrets” uses four narrators: the
main narrator is Kalaman, with others
supplying supporting narratives. This
gives the reader fresh perspectives
into the novel's complicated twists
and turns. _

Tyrese .
RCA Records

If you think the voice and face are
familiar you're right. Tyrese is proba-
bly best known from Coca-Cola com-
mercials in which he gets on a bus
wearing headphones, sits down and
sings their praises.

On his self-titled album, Tyrese
makes it clear he is much more than a
soda pitchman, but his production and
lyrics still have him selling pop music
that ﬂuctuates between the repulsive
consumption of a ﬂat soda and the
refreshment of an ice-cold soft drink.

Tyrese has an expressive gospel-
inﬂuenced voice. He shows his Vocal
strength on all the songs, but excels on
the ballads. The best is ”Lately.”

The album also has several enjoy-
able fast-tempo songs including,
”Nobody Else,” a song which features
Tyrese rapping midway through,
along with a funky  loop, and
”Do you need,” which features a rap
by Peter Gunz.

New Iack Swing style of many East
coast R&B groups and the newer jazz-
inﬂuenced sound popularized by such
artists as D’ Angelo and Maxwell com-
prise Tyrese’s sound.

both ends of the urban music spec-
trum, most of the songs come out as
commercial pop / R&B and rely heavily
on a hip-hop-inﬂuenced bass line.

Songs like, ”Nobody Else” are
well-suited for their heavy instrumen-
tals, but overbearing drums drown out
the romance of ”Sweet Lady.”

Tyrese never expresses a clear
voice throughout the album. The bass-
heavy production often drowns out his
emphatic singing and makes his music
seem as ﬂat as the aforementioned
decarbonated soda. In most of the
songs, Tyrese is forced to compensate
for bland lyrics by adding forced emo-
tion in the place of content.

But Tyrese’s singing ability is
unquestionable. Despite mediocre
material that hinders his talent, the
album is enjoyable for romantics who
don't mind an overbearing dance beat.

Elements of Life might seem like a '

pretentious album title in an industry
populated by Foo Fighters‘ and
Mustard Plugs, but perhaps it’ s just a
simple recognition of talent by EOL,
the responsible party. After all, life imi-

The album captures the contem-
porary hip-hop sound, incorporating a
mix of funk, soul, pop and R&B.
They're an inspirational group for the

BOOKS CONT|NUED FROM PAGE 9
sion to keep Somalia alive by writing
about its culture, landscape and peo-
ple. He has contributed something that
can be called quintessentially Somalian
to the realm of English literature.
Farah’s writing about Somali life is
interesting, and it’ s not too foreign or
irrelevant to the Western reader.

Farah’s admonition that withheld
secrets and concealed pasts will lead to
chaos holds true for us all, making his
book a good read for anyone.

 

Lama Surya Das, an American
born Jeffrey Miller into a Jewish mid-
dle-class family, is the most highly-
trained American lama in the Tibetan
Buddhist tradition. With his book,
”Awakening the Buddha Within,”
Lama Surya Das brings the teachings
of Tibetan Buddhism — particularly
the Dzogchen lineage —- to the
American reader.

Lama Surya Das adapts Buddhist
wisdom and practices to fit into the
American lifestyle. He gives advice on
how to live a life geared towards
enlightenment while coping with
work, children, marriage and love. But
in westemizing Buddhist principles,
he's stripped the teachings to their bare
essentials, and lost the mysticism that
attracted over ﬁve million Americans.

He presents an eight-fold path
towards enlightenment within the
three major disciplines of Tibetan
Buddhism. Steps one and two are part
of Wisdom Training: holding the right
View and having the right intentions.
Steps three, four and are part of Ethics
Training: having the right speech, tak-
ing the right action and having the
right livelihood.

Steps six, seven and eight deal
with Meditation Training: the right
effort, the right mindfulness and the
right concentration.

THE Pin News

These are the eight steps to
enlightenment as prescribed by
Buddha himself in his ”Nob1e Eight-
Fold Path.” Lama Surya Das puts sev-
eral teachings of Tibetan Buddhism
into a western context and gives a brief
background of Buddhist history from
500 B.C. to the present. He demystiﬁes
a religion — and way of life — that has
gained popularity in North America.

However, there is something lost
in the demystification process. The
book reads like any self-help book, and
is a stark contrast from the View of
Buddhism offered in movies like
Kundun. While it would be foolish to
call it ”corporate Buddhism,” one can't
help compare the book to those suc-
cess-in-the-workplace guides. Lama
Surya Das’s prognosis is far different
than those offered by the corporate-
ladder-climbers, but it does share the
same target audience.

”Awakening the Buddha Within”
serves up a message that is the antithe-
sis of those corporate self-help books.
Lama Surya Das calls craving --
whether it be for money, social position
or other peoples’ goods —— one of the
evils of the world today. He offers a
slowed-down solution for a fast-paced
world.

New Albums

FROM PAGE 10

Fresh from ‘Washington, D.C.,
the EOL boys deliver a sound that
represents their extraordinary talent.
This enticing quartet may not sound
familiar, but that’ s not surprising.
Fans have only tasted a tiny morsel of
EOL with their single "Sweet Love,”
released in 1997.

EOL’s smooth sound is the
sophistication of Boys II Men meeting

I the down-to-earth style of PM Dawn.

But EOL concentrates mostly on
singing the tunes. These boys are not
in the writing business, having only
co—written three tracks on this album.

Fans may be surprised to hear a

bit of Snoop Doggy Dog and
Naughty by Nature rapper Treach in
”Freaky Tonight.” And the 1997
morsel ”Sweet Love” is a remake of
Anita Baker's ’80’s hit re-energized
for the '90s.

And ”Boulevard” ties up the
ends of the album with an a cappella
performance that will take you back
to that popular street-corner harmo-
ny.

EOL is definitely on its way to
becoming one of the most captivating
new hip—hop groups around.

We all know how competitive and
ruthless corporate wars can be. Coke
vs. Pepsi, McDonald’s vs. Burger
King, WWF vs. WCW.

Wait a minute .
WCW?

Yep. The competition between the
two top professional wrestling organi-
zations is so heated and the hatred so
vile that Time Magazine even ran a
story about it last week.

Professional wrestling is more pop-
ular thanever. According to A&E, each
week more people across the world
tune in to watchwrestling than the pop-
ulations of New York, Los Angeles and
Chicago combined.

The ratings for WWF’s “RAW”
and WCW’s “Nitro” are the highest of
any cable (non—network) show on TV.

The only problem is that just like
two wrestlers in the ring, RAW and
Nitro are pitted directly against each

..WWF vs.

. other; Both air Monday nights, RAW

on the USA network and Nitro on TNT.

So which one should you watch?

RAW. _

The WWF. is just ﬂat out more
entertaining. This was never more
obvious than at Sunday night’s pay-
per-view from Pittsburgh when The
Undertaker hurled Mankind off of a 20-
foot steel cage, through a wooden table
and onto a concrete ﬂoor.

For years, the WWF held a virtual
monopoly on the business. Everybody
remembers the days when Hulk Hogan
was the icon. Tell me you don’t still
have that image in your mind: the
Hulkster, clad in red and yellow, tear-

ing off his shirt in the ring as “I am a ,

Real American” blared in the back-
ground.

But a few years back, multi-bil-
lionaire Ted 'I‘L1rner bought the National
Wrestling Alliance, the WWF’s closest
but distant competitor, and changed its
name to World Championship
Wrestling. He appointed Eric Bischoff
to run the organization, and since then,
things have never been the same.

Ted’s deep pockets lured away
‘many of the WWF’s biggest draws like
Hogan - himself, and other big names
including Macho Man Randy Savage,
Scott Hall, -Kevin Nash, and more
recently, Bret “The Hitman” Hart.

When Bischoff came up with the
NWO (New World Order), a plot of a
rival league within WCW, WWF fell
out of the top spot in the ratings for the
first time.

But since Wrestlemania XIV, the
WVVF has been back on top. How did
they do it?

KQV obtains rights to broadcast
Pitt football and basketball

Mark O'Connor

Staff Wrlter

If you want to listen to a
University of Pittsburgh football or
basketball game this coming season,
you are going to have to move your
radio dial to 1410
KQV—AM from 1250
WTAE—A.M.

The University
has joined forces
with KQV and
Pinnacle Sports
Network of Omaha,

strengthen its signal
and cultivate more
fans. L

The move severed a nearly thirty
year relationship with WTAE, which
has carried Pitt football since the 1969
season and basketball since the 1970
season. -
Bill Hillgrove, entering his 25th
season with Pitt, has been retained as
the play-by-play commentator for both
the football and basketball games.

The roles of football color com-
mentator Billy Osborne and basketball

ALI. NEVIS/All

color analyst Dick Groat are still unre-
solved. Osborne has worked for the
University for the past three seasons,
while Groat has supplied his commen- ‘
tary for 18 years. *

“KQV is a pillar in the radio com-
munity in Pittsburgh. They are the sec-

 
   

ond oldest radio station in the United
States and their reputation is impecca-
ble,” said E.J. Borghetti, director of
media relations in Pitt’s Sports
Information Department.

Borghetti said the University was
looking to establish a powerful sports
network, and the team of KQV and
Pinnacle was too good to pass up.

In the last few years, legions of
fans have complained that they haven’t

i

been able to pick up Pitt’s football and
basketball games on WTAE,”
Borghetti added. ‘

Pinnacle Sports, located in Omaha,
Neb., broadcasts University of
Nebraska football and basketball
games and has established a huge net-
work of affiliate sta-
tions, something
Pitt is seeking from
this venture.

T h e
University is look-
ing for more control
over marketing and
production of their
football and basket-
ball games.

The move to
KQV is a reunion of sorts, as all the
principles are affiliated with Pitt in
some way.

Athletics Director Steve Pederson
was the assistant athletics director at
the University of Nebraska before he
came to Pitt.

. Also, Pinnacle’s President Paul
Arron is a 1968 graduate of the Pitt;
and KQV owner Robert Dickey was a‘
letterman in the 1940s. .

Pittsburgh sees bloody WWF pay-perview een  

Asslstantsports Edltor

“Mankind”, the WWF character, is
a deranged psycho—lunatic. But after
Sunday night’s “King of the Ring”
show at the Civic Arena, it’s obvious
that Mick Foley, the real-life guy who

plays Mankind, is even more of a-

deranged psycho-lunatic.

During his “Hell in a Cell” match
against the Undertaker, Mankind was
thrown off the top of a 20-foot high
steel cage. The 300-pound man splat-
tered on the concrete ﬂoor after crash-
ing through an announcer’s table, com-
plete with television monitors, and then
bounced off of a steel barricade.

He eventually got up from that spill
and climbed to the top of the cage again
only to get choke—slammed through the
cage’s roof for his second 20+ foot
plunge of the night - this time onto a
steel chair lying in the ring.

The blood and carnage continued
as the Undertaker slammed Mankind
onto the mat which was covered with
metal tacks. Twice.

The fan-favorite Undertaker even-

tually won the match with a tombstone
pile-driver, but he wasn’t the hero of
the night. Mankind, the bad guy, got a
standing ovation for the courageous

(and in many eyes, idiotic) show he put a if

on.

You might be thinking, “Whatthe
hell is this kid talking about, we all
know professional wrestling is fake.”

‘ Well the truth is, yes, professional
wrestling is fake. It’s scripted, just like
a movie. But it’s also entertainment,
just like a movie.

Fake or not, it’s fact that it takes a
hell of a lot of athleticism and a hell of
a lot of balls to do some of the things
these guys do. You can’t fake a 20-foot
fall (and no, the table was not padded).

Those were also real tacks in the
ring. Mankind was wearing a white
shirt, and as soon as he got slammed on
to the tacks, he sprung up. The white
shirt suddenly had several blood marks
on it that progressively got bigger and
bloodier. Trust me, there was no time to
squirt any fake blood back there.

Nowadays, even most people in the
business will pretty much admit it’s

COLUMN

dad owned the company before he did.

For one thing, the WWF has better
story lines. Come on, face it, wrestling is
simply soap operas for men.

The WCW’s NW 0 gimmick was
cool at first, but that is all they have.
Here we are, some two years after the
NWO began, and WCW is still trying to
use that to lure viewers.

The gimmick is boring and old, and
the WCW has dug itself into a hole.
Now, it would be virtually impossible to
write the NWO out of their plot, so as a
result, the shows are pathetically pre-
dictable.

Another thing: WCW is full of old,
washed up guys who can’t even wrestle
any more, Yeah,°it’s, fake, but those guys
still have to be athletes to do the things

FROM PAGE 12

V they do.

WCW pumps millions into guys like
Hogan because they: are big names. Sure,
many? casual fans will watch WCW
because they irecogiiize the names from
their youth’, but any real fan doesn’t‘ even
botherwith WCW because the wrestling
reminds tl);,e}m},«;'o£e*a fight over chips on

V A bingo-day ‘geriatric home.

A month or so ago, WCW’s main

event was Hogan vs. Rowdy Roddy-

Piper. These two were part of a WWF tag
team main event at Wrestlemania One,
14 years ago!

Another WCW mistake is giving
Hogan too much power. The man’s ego

is bigger than his “24-inch pythons.” In

13

WCW, what Hogan says goes. He’s
always the champ despite the fans want-
ing to see someone else with the belt.

WWF, on the othervhand, is full of
hot, young talent. Thesealguys ﬂy all over
the ring doing aerial-“inoves that would
paralyze Hogan. —

The WWF has dozens of unpre-
dictable plots to keep the fans guessing.
Stone Cold Steve Austin is the ‘most pop-
ular wrestler in the world because of his
amusing crude language and impressive
athletic ability. Absolutely no one would
have guessed he wold lose the title on
Sunday night, but he did.

As a result, the WWF blew WCW
out of the water in Monday night’s rat-
ings; fans tuned in to see what would
happen next.

Another WWF plot line that the fans
love is Degeneration X, a group of
young punks who walk around and yell
“Suck It!”

The WWF also features bloody,
hardcore wrestling and Val Venis, a
wrestler who plays a porn star.

If you are a wrestling fan, even just
partly, do yourself and the wrestling
world a favor. Watch WWF “RAW” on
Monday nights and tell Billionaire Ted
and his predictable, geriatric approach to
wrestling to “SUCK IT!”

Brian Knavish is the Assistant Sports
Editor for The Pitt News and thinks that
anyone who makes fun of professional
wrestling for being fake is a hypocrite
unless he's never watched a fictional TV
show, movie or play.

Headbangers and Al Snow revved them
up even more.

The crowd got louder and louder as
the night’s matches progressed. The
Mankind—Undertaker blood bath was,
by far, the best match of the night, but
it wasn’t the only one that grabbed the
fans’ attention.

In a huge surprise upset, WWF
Champion Stone Cold Steve Austin, the
world’s most popular wrestler, lost his
belt to Kane, the Undertaker’s evil
brother. It was a “First Blood” contest
in which the winner was the man who
made his opponent bleed first.

During the match, referee Earl
Hebner got “knocked out.” During his
brief but timely coma, Mankind wad-
dled back down to the ring, followed by
the Undertaker.

The Undertaker picked up a chair
and took a swing at Mankind who

ducked, leaving Austin’s head to absorb
the blow. This cut Austin’s head wide
open (we won’t mention him reaching
into his tights and cutting his forehead
with a -razor blade as he lay on the mat).

The ref conveniently woke up to
the sight of Austin bleeding. He rang
the bell and awarded the belt to Kane as
the shocked crowd stood in silent dis-
belief. But one night later on “RAW,”
Austin regained the championship by
beating Kane. I

In other action, Ken “The World’s
Most Dangerous Man” Shamrock won
the King of the Ring tournament. He
defeated Jeff “Double J” Jarrett and
Rocky “The Rock” Maivia, the WWF
Intercontinental Champion, to win the
crown.

The WWF Tag Team Champions,
The New Age Outlaws, successfully
defended their belts against The
Midnight Express. The Midnight
Express were surprise challengers, as
veteran tag team The Legion of Doom
were the scheduled opponents.

In another tag team match, Al
Snow and Head (a mannequin head)
dropped a controversial match to Too
Much. Biased guest referee Jerry
Lawler counted as Brian Christopher
pinned Head, but Snow simultaneously
had Scott Taylor pinned.

In a three—on—three match, The
Headbangers and Taka Michonoku
defeated the Japanese trio Tai en Chi,
while in singles action, Degeneration X
member, X—pac, defeated Owen Hart, a
member of the Nation of Domination.

Dinkins not moving quite yet

Patrick Robertson
Sports Editor

DJ Dinkins has been shufﬂed more
than a deck of cards by the Pittsburgh
coaching staff.

He came to camp last year as a
quarterback after playing a bit of
receiver the year before, but by the end
of camp he was a defensive back. He
played most of the season there, but
still threw before games as a quarter-
back.

Dinkins had to know both the
offense and the defense, but by the end
of the season he had solidiﬁed himself
in the defensive backfield.

This spring, rumors have been
ﬂoating that Dinkins may move again
to linebacker. A spokesman for the
team said Dinkins is still the leading
candidate to start at free safety this fall.

Dinkins started four games last
year in the defensive backfield and
played in all of the Panthers’ contests.

He recorded 42 tackles last season.

Dinkins played his best game
against Houston with a crucial inter-
ception at the end of the game to seal a
Panther victory.

Dinkins also spent some time at
wide receiver during the 1996 cam—
paign catching four balls for 14 yards.

DJ Dinkins, pictured .as a quaterbock,
will remain on defense this season.
