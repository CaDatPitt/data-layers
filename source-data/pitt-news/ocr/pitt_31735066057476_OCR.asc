No. I“Stanford 5

By Adam Pincus
Staff Writer

The bleachers at Fitzgerald
Fieldhouse were filled last
night to watch the Lady
Panthers volleyball team take
on the No.1-ranked team in
the country, the Stanford
Cardinal.

Pitt played hard, but was
not able to slow down
Stanford, who won the match
in three games by the scores
of 15-4. 15-7, and 15-11.

“We’re still out of school
for another three weeks,”
Stanford head coach Don
Shaw said. “So we are on a
IO-game road swing right
now. and it gives us a chance
to see other parts of the coun-
try, play some other teams in
other areas and promote the
growth of women’s volley-
ball. We are going to make
sure we play as strong of a
team as we can when we go
out there so that will help

was very solid, and that is
something much improved
this year over last year.
Tonight. I thought we
blocked very well against a
team that had as much
offense as we are going to
see on the year.”

Despite the loss, Pitt was
able to see that they can be
competitive against the best
competition.

“Even though it is the No. 1
team in the nation, they are
still not invincible.” Alvear
said. “I think our team can
see just how close _-we are to
being an excellent team.

Playing the No liteam does

give us the chance to
improve because we are not
going to see this kind of
speed on the ball offensively,
we are not going to have that
many teams ball—handle that
well against us. We can build
some confidence.”

Driscoll played a solid game

for Pitt and felt that the game
served  a no-lose situation.
“You are always intimidat-
ed by the top team in .the
country,” said Driscoll. “I
wasn’t really intimidated
because I didn’t know what
to expect, and I said either
way, ‘we are goingto go out

prepare us for the Pac-10.”

This was Pitt’s first home
game of the year, and it
served as a barometer for the
team. '

“I think there were some
real bright spots,” head coach ,
Cindy Alvear said. “I think

As a senior at Pahokee
High School in Florida,
Denorse Mosley chose to
take a football scholarship at
Pitt over Florida State and
Miami because he would be
given a chance to play early.

“I came to Pitt because I
had a chance to play as a
freshman,” Mosley said.
“Johnny Majors came back,
and I wanted to be coached
by him and I wanted to get
away from home.”

What Mosley didn’t know
was that college ball is a
whole lot different from high
schooL

Last season, as a true fresh-
men, Mosley, started in six
games for the Panthers, thus
playing on his first losing
team ever. As the season con-
cluded, he had 22 total tack-
les and four pass deﬂections.

“I was just thrown in
there,” he said. “I didn’t

The Pitt News, Thursday, Septemberil8;ii?1W§94

Mosley gains strength, speed, confidence i off-season

ing coming from a high
school were we didn’t lose
many games. Coming up
here, I wasn’t used to that. I
would call home and talk to
my mom. I talked to my
cousin John Davis, a former

, strong safety at Florida State.

He told me to, ‘keep your
head up. You have a young
team and it is going to be like
that the first couple of sea-
sons. But as long as you guys
stay together and just play,
things will work out.”’

But according to Mosley,
that was then and this is now.

After going home and prac-
ticing with his high school
teammates, who now play
Division 1 ball, he swears
that this year will be differ-
ent.

After his performance last

week, in the 30—28 loss to
Texas, who would dare to
disagree with the cornerback.
In that game, Mosley played
as if he was possessed. All in
all, he finished the game with
11 tackles and four pass
deflections. Afterwards, his
teammates had this to say.
, “He had a good game,”
linebacker Tom Tumulty
said. “I don’t know if any-
thing great happened in the
secondary, but Denorse is a
good player. He is a young,
good player and I like him.
He is kind of quiet. He is a
leader in his performance,
and I am happy to have him
onthe team. We are all happy
to have him playing.

“He has the ability. He can
tackle. He is real fast. He can
really run.”

“Superb,” added wide
receiver Dietrich Jells. “I
think last year was sort of a
learning experience for him. I

think he is going for the ball

more [this year]. He reacts to
the ball better.

“Last year he was beat
deep a couple times. It was
like he wasn’t attacking the
ball. He is attacking it better
this year.”

After the game Mosley was
compared to some of the
greatest defensive backs that
have ever played college
football.

Pitt runningback Curtis
Martin said that Mosley
reminded him of former
Florida State great Terrell
Buckley, who is presently
playing for the Green Bay
Packers.

But to Mosley, it is too
early for comparisons.

“I don’t compare myself to
him,” Mosley said. “But if
people want to say that, then
it is cool but I don’t really
compare myself to people.” e

What he would rather think
about is how he has matured
as a ball player since last sea-
son. He has gained 10 pounds
to his frame and now weighs
185 pounds to go a long with
his height of six feet.

- His bench press has
increased from 225 to 285

Win/ess of home

By Brady Slater
Staff Writer

Winless in seven home
games since his return to Pitt
last year. Johnny Majors. the
man chosen to lead Pitt back
to the promised land. talks as
if his football team has been
hit with a plague.

“We need to win. lt’s up for
us to be as hungry as if we’d
been on a drought.” Majors
said.

“lt’s hard —— a period of
time with nothing to eat or
nothing to drink. That’s how
hard we should work to pre-
pare for the ball game.”

Knowing the 26-year
coaching veteran Majors, pre-
pared is what his Panthers
will be going into Saturday’s
home game against Ohio
University.

After the two—point loss to
Texas last Saturday. Majors
cited penalites as. “the
biggest factor in _the ball
game. without question, by
far.”

He was right. The Panthers
had 11' penalties for

100 yards. Two crucial penal-
ties, a roughing the punter in
the second quarter and a face-
mask on a third-and-six in the

In

third quarter. kept Texas
touchdown drives alive.

“You’re going to get a
roughing the kicker on occa-
sion, if you’re aggressive and
trying to make things hap-
pen,” Majors said.

“But that can be improved
by the angle that you go for
the ball. We haveworked on
that, and we have to work on
that better.”

Don’t expect those kinds of
mistakes to be an oversight
this Saturday. Majors’ club
.has been drilling on what he
calls the “little things” all
week. '

“That’s something 
coaches and players we need
to emphasize strongly: the
importance of little things.”
Majors said.

“Little things make big
things. We can’t afford to lose
games by our own mistakes.

We have to correct the cor- _

rectables now.”

Saturday’s game against the
tame Bobcats of the Mid-
American Conference should
provide the Panthers as good
a chance to play mistake-
free football as they’ll have
this season. But forever the
coach, Majors remains cau-
tious.

  Panthers look to end—’7drought" in Majors‘ era
'93, Majors could notch first victory

Pitt News File Photo

Wideout Dietrich Jells (26) hopes to have his first win since his 1993 injury.

“This game will not be
easy,” Majors said.

“I’ve never been in an easy
game in my entire life going
into it.”

Things are always easier for
Majors when senior offensive
tackle Reuben Brown is in the
lineup. Brown "will be ready
to start the Ohio U. game
after getting banged up in the
Texas game.

“A guy came in and hit me
in the side in my kidney
area,” Brown said. “After I
got hit the whole time I tried
to block people I was getting
cramps in my side, and they
were pulling me to one side. I
fought through it, and I’m
feeling better now.”

Another player feeling bet-
ter is junior wide receiver
Dietrich Jells. After missing
the last eight games of the
1993 season with nagging
knee injuries, Jells returned to
the Panthers’ lineup against
Texas and looked like the
same player who set
Panthers’ single season
records for receptions (55)
and receiving yards (1,091) in
1992. Jells caught three pass-
es for 83 yards against the
Longhorns, including a 64-
yard touchdown reception.

“I feel I’m back in the ﬂow
of the system,” Jells said.
“Now I just want to win a
game. The Southern»Miss
game was the last time I was
in a game we won.”

Senior running back Curtis
Martin was also plagued with
nagging injuries last season.
A shoulder injury forced him
out of last year’s West
Virginia game at halftime,
and he ‘missed the Rutgers
game the following week. But
at 204 pounds, Martin entered
the Texas game 21 pounds of
muscle heavier than he was
last season, and he liked the
results.

“I definitely feel much

more durable,” Martin said.
“Last year if I carried the
ball 28 times, like I did in
the Texas game, my
legs would’ve been burning.
I’d feel so weak that my
body would just‘ feel like
I couldn’t take another

hit. Now, I feel just as strong
at the end of the game  I
did when I started -the
game.” I

That is bad news for the
Bobcats. whose job will be to
stop the man who just rushed

Bobcats‘ revamped defens

Martin
heads
OU '5
concerns

By Brett Fondrk
Staﬂ Writer

Ohio defensive coordinator
Nick Toth has tons of confi-
dence in his defense.

“It takes five years to build a
good defense,” he said in the
‘94 Ohio media guide. “We
have done it in three.”

Toth and the rest of the
Bobcats will find out how
“good” their defense actually is
when they face the high-pow-
ered Pitt rushing attack led by
Curtis Martin Saturday night.

Ohio returns nine defensive
starters from last year’s 4-7
squad that was ranked sixth in
total defense in the Mid-
American Conference.
However, they were ranked
ninth out of ten teams in rush-
ing defense and justifiably
have respect for Martin.

“Curtis Martin is as good a
running back as Ohio
University has played since
l’ve been here,” head coach
Tom Lichtenberg said. “Maybe

the best that we’ve played.”

“We’ve got to be able to stop
him. I don’t know if there is a
way to stop him.”

The unit assigned to that task
will be led by junior strong
safety Damiso Johnson who is
in his third year as a starter and
was third on the team in tackles
last season.

Lichtenburg is also high on
linebackers Benny‘ King and
Jaabar Thompson, both are

‘two-year starters. King is an

All-MAC candidate who led
the team in tackles in 1993.
Thompson is an All—League
candidate who has excellent
quickness and speed.

These two and the rest of the
Bobcat defense will have their
hands full with Martin, who
shredded Texas last week for
251 yards and was named Big
East Player of the Week.

“You put Curtis Martin in a
hole where he’s got a seam,
he’s a great running back. He
makes great cuts,” Lichtenberg
said. “You can’t expect our
linebacker, or Texas’, or Ohio
State’s to stop him one—on-
one.”

“You have to stop him with a
good pursuit to the ball, and
then you better not arm tackle
him because he’ll run right
through that.”

The Ohio offense will be
without their top rusher from a
year ago. Tim Curtis, who is

the all-time leading rusher in
Ohio history, graduated and
left a huge void to fill in the
offense.

Junior Lakarlos Townsend,
who carried the ball 126 times
for 582 yards last year, will
attempt to pick up the offen-
sive slack. He will be compli-
mented by the passing of
senior quarterback Sam Vink.
Vink won the starting job at the
end of last season and complet-
ed 31 of 68 passes for 486
yards.

“He’s got good mobility and
a strong arm,” Lichtenberg
said. “He has a knack for find-
ing people. These are things
you don’t teach kids.”

Vink will be protected by a
veteran offensive line anchored
by 6-feet-5 inch, 285-pound
senior Andy Canter who is
rated as the best lineman on the
team.

Canter will try to protect
Vink from a Panther defense
that Lichtenberg describes as
“physical.”

“[Pitt’s] play against Texas
was much better than the press
had thought,” he said. “They
should have won the ball-
game.”

“Defensively, they fly around
the football and make things
happen. We’ve got our hands
full and that’s for sure. I
thought maybe we had caught
Pitt in a rebuilding year, but

Surrounded by C urtis

Ohio RB Townsend gains,

By Matt Groff
Senior Staff Writer .

‘‘Curtis.’’ »

Say it around Ohio
University junior running
back Lakarlos Townsend and
you are bound to get a reac-
tion. He’ll probably offer a
compliment about the run-
ning back and act like he

- thinks nothing of it.

But Townsend will almost

’ certainly have Curtis on his

mind this Saturday as he
enters Pitt Stadium, because
he’ll be running to prove
something against more than
one Curtis.

“He’s very aggressive and
knows how to follow his
blockers,” Townsend said of
OU’s main concern this
week, Pitt’s running back
Curtis Martin. “He hits the
holes fast.”

Martin, one of the top rush-
ers in the country this past
week as well as in Pitt histo-
ry, will be trying to pound
OU for the kind of triple-
digit yardage that may give
him a run at the Heisman
Trophy. But Townsend is also
playing in the shadow of a
Curtis who has already left
his mark on OU, graduated
running back Tim Curtis.

“I learned a lot from him:
how to run hard, keep my
legs moving and how to have

patience in [the
game],”’ Townsend said of
Curtis, who was an All Mid-

-American Conference first

teamer and‘OU’s all-time
career rushing leader.

Townsend, whose speed
and versatility have been
highly acclaimed by the staff
at OU, knows he may have
to answer to critics if his per-
formance doesn’t match
Curtis’.

“Lakarlos is much quicker
than Tim Curtis, but he will
fit well into the same type
of offense,” running backs
coach Robert Procter
said.

“We are not going to
change our offense from what
we used with Curtis.”

That leads to high expecta-
tions from someone replacing
a running back who will
probably be remembered for
leading the team to four wins
in his last five games.

“He was a great back, but
more of a power runner. He’d
run right through the mid-
dle,” Townsend said. “I’m

runner.” I

Townsend said despite the
pressure and his 5’9” size, he
welcomes the chance to
prove he is a premier back.

“We basically switched
every two downs last year, so
I have a lot of

own identity

experience,” said Townsend,
who finished ‘93 with 582
yards and an impressive 4.4
yard average. “I think I’m
more versatile than Tim as
far as running out of the
backfield and catching pass-
es.

“Last year our attack was
running-oriented, but this
year we’ll be better balanced
because the quarterback is
more experienced,” he said.

“That will give me more

opportunities.” .

When speaking of Pitt,
Townsend expresses confi-
dence about the Bobcats’ trip
to the ‘Burgh, a fairly sur-
prising attitude coming from
a team that finished in the
bottom half of the MAC last
season. _ :.
, ‘‘We’reboth coming off 
so seasons, rebuilding yeﬁ
for both teams,” Towns-eiid
said. ‘ . 

“[Pitt] will be tough, b 
know we can play hard or!"

Townsend’s confide
may stem from the fact tlﬁ
not only did OU have a be  ,
record than Pitt last year, f" 
but also that the team has 
only once since last Octob§
heading into this Saturda‘
night’s game, their 
opener. 

“I’m glad to be openin
against Pitt,” he said.

Volleyball

‘From P-3
say we have to win or we are
going to lose. We just wanted
to play our game the best
we can and whatever hap-
pens, happens.

“We are going to walk
away a winner either way, as
long as we play hard and we
get better, and that was all we
were really worried about
today.”

Pitt also got a strong effort
from ’junior Sarah Mikla and
sophomore transfer Stephanie
Dufresne.

“Sarah Mikla did a real nice
job,” said Alvear. “As a right-
side player, everything keys
around that player, and I
thought she did a real nice
job there.

“Stephanie Dufresne started
out a little shaky at the set-
ting position, but she came
back and really set a nice
game. She was able to really
get a clear focus and make
good decisions. We didn’t
quite serve as well as I
thought we could, but we
started digging in and
playing a little defense there

 

discipline and fundamentals.
which was Alvear’s focus for
the match.

“Every team is going to get
their big kills, and every team
is going to get their big
plays,” Alvear said.

“Right now at the begin-
ning of the season, we are
more concerned about what is
going on
on our
side of
the court
and if
we are
d i s c i —
pl i n e d
in the
middle blocking position, and
we are running a good
offense, and if we are ball
handling defensively in the
right place and do it well,
then we will get our share of
wins.”

Another key to a successful
season for Pitt is tenacity, and
Alvear said it is something
the team has been working

on.

“That is something that we
have control over,” Alvear
said.

“You have control over how
hard you go and how ready
you are to play, you don’t
have control over how good
the other team is.

“We don’t have one big
time player this year, its got
to be more of a team effort
than any time before, and
one of the things that as a
team we want to focus on and
get better at is playing as
hard as we can and grovel-
ling. and just being a team
that never gives up,” Alvear
said.

“That is something you
learn, because  you do it
you understand it more. It
is not something you turn
off, and I think we made a
lot of progress on it this
game, so hopefully it is going
to bear well for the rest of the
season, starting this week-
end.”

rebuilding has already taken
place.”

The Bobcats are also in the
midst of a rebuilding program.
Like Pitt, they lack depth and
are coming off a losing season.
They return 35 players and
hope that these players can
continue the win streak at the
end of last season that saw the
Bobcats win four of their last
five.

“To leam how to win, you’ve
got to win,” Lichtenberg said.
“We had a bunch of youngsters
last year, most of them are
juniors this year. We knew it

would take four or five years.
Once we got that first win, we
knew we could win and play
well. The biggest change was
the attitude.”

Ohio Notes: This is the first
game of the season for the
Bobcats Lichtenberg’s
career record at Ohio is 8-34-2
 Ohio is 0-2 against Pitt  In

Townsend

0From page P-7

“When we play big teams,
that’s when my performance
peaks.”

Proctor said the Pitt
defense may be surprised by
Townsend.

“He’s gonna line up, and
I'm telling you he’s gonna go
right at Pitt every snap like
it’s his last,” Proctor said. “I
think it will be a very good
matchup.”

Proctor, an Ohio coach for

three years, said although '

Townsend has the potential
to become OU’s best running
back by numbers, his
most valuable contribution to
the university is his charac-
ter.

“He’s always studying, try-
ing to break that dumb jock
image,” Proctor said. “He’s
full of energy and always
working to improve our
image.”

According to Proctor,
Townsend can usually be
seen talking with the local

‘children on his way to and

from games. 1

“He treats everyone the
same, from the president of
this university to the guy
who pumps gas on the cor-
ner,” Proctor said. “He’s just
a pleasure to coach.”

Regardless of his off-the-
field amiability, Townsend
said he’ll do anything on the.
field to reach his goal.

“To be the starting tailback
in a bow1,”‘he said. “Nobody
really stands out in our con-
ference this year; I think we
have a real shot at the MAC
title.”

ing a lack of input from the

The two departments were

PITTSBURGH — Possible
reversal of thrust in the right
engine of USAir flight 427
from Chicago to West Palm
Beach, Fla. is being explored
as a cause of Thursday’s
crash that killed 132 people,
an investigator said.

“If you’re flying along
with two engines and one
suddenly reverses, you can
imagine the consequences it
would have,” Carl Vogt,
National Safety
Transportation investigator,
said at a news conference
Saturday.

The reversers cause the
thrust from the engine to be
reversed, producing a stop-
ping motion, Vogt said.

USAir flight 427 plunged
to the earth seven miles
northwest of Pittsburgh on
Thursday evening and was
the worst air crash in the

The district attorney’s

the decision not to seek life
in prison without parole for
Simpson if he is found guilty
in the murders of his ex-wife
and a male friend.

Due to the fact that
Simpson does not have a

fact that domestic violence
cases rarely call for the death
penalty, many legal experts
expected Garcetti to steer

“It’s our informal rap ses-

Dr. Patricia Wright of

speaker at Indaba, which
means conference in Zulu.

“Dr. Wright spoke on self-

about how to advance our-

selves in the future,”
Washington said.
Along with Wright,

Indaba and the picnic served
as a way to get every-
one involved in the commi-

Washington.

“This is a chance for black
students to meet other black
students,organizations and-
fraternities,”said
Washington.

Washington said he will
work hard to reach the goals
of BAS this year.

“We want to be more

active and get more stu-

to get more black adminis-
trators,” he said.
“ We are also trying to find
a space for our black cul-
tural center,” according to

Sudzina said CWO also
plans to support a first-year
woman who was sexually

assaulted on campus over the

summer.

“We will not tolerate
a rapist or a sexual
assaulter on campus,”
Hassan said. “[The
accused perpetrator] still

The organization will bring

to Dolin, and CWO

folk singer Anna
DeFranco to perform on

In an effort to delegate
power, Sudzina, said,
CWO is creating four

The committees can

their specific issues,

rather than the officers try-

times because it is too hard
to get classes during regis-
tration.”

During add/drop, some
students may drop a course
and open it to other students
who made need it.

College of Arts and
Sciences advisors said they
encourage students to
add/drop.

“A lot of courses are
closed,” said first-year advi-
sor Amy Bellmar. “This
way they may be. able to get
interesting ones.”

Donna Brett, an advisor
for the past six years,
explained why she
encourages add/drop.

“[A course] may not be
what they expected  or
they have too heavy of a
load.”

“Or too light of a load,”
added Bellmar.

Once students have decid-
ed to add or drop a class,

going to Thackeray and‘

standing in line may not
be thrilling to many stu-
dents.

Paula Owens, who works
in Thackeray’s Registration
Department, said students
usually don’t waittoo long.

“But it depends on the
day. If it‘is crowded, it
will be a while,” Owens
said.

She also pointed out, “The
first day of classes and the
last day [of add/drop] are
the heaviest days.”

The University Registrar,
Samuel D. Conte, assured,
“We could handle a thou-
sand students a day, and
you’ll never see a line as
long as they don’t all
come at once.”

Conte also said the Fall
term usually has 15-16,000
students add or drop and the
Spring has around 12-
13,000.

After add/drop has
ended, some students real-
ize a course is not for
them. An option then is
to have a Monitored
Withdraw.

Students may withdraw
from a course and “W”
will appear on the tran-

‘script.
This does not affect
their. Quality Point

Average either. Bellmar
and Brett agreed -“W”
grades should have little
bearing, if any, on how
future employers view a

transcript.

Beitko withdrew from a
course only once. “I failed
my first test,” he said.

Junior Megan Dawes also
withdrew from a course last
year -

“I got too behind, and
there was no way I’d catch
up,” she said. ‘Besides, I
didn’t like my teacher that
much.” ~
I With 3-4,000 students
withdrawing during a
semester, both Bellmar and
Brett said Withdraw should
not be away of avoiding all
hard courses.

Brett ‘said, “One or two
over the four years aren’t
bad, but I had students do
one a semester.” '

“I will suggest [with-

draw] as an option that is .

better than a three or four

credit F.”
Add/drop,

may still be

however,
the best

option since nothing will -
appear on the transcript »

and an unwanted
course can be replaced
by something more
desirable.

For those who have yet to
do so, get in line now.

NEW YORK — Actress
Jessica Tandy has died at the
age of 85, CBS Radio
reported Sunday.

Tandy electrified theater

audiences in 1947 as the-

original Blanche du Bois in
“A Streetcar Named Desire,”
but the London—born actress
found her greatest fame late
in life with her Oscar-win-
ning performance as a south-
ern matron in “Driving Miss
Daisy.”

Until that pivotal moment,
which came at the age of 80,
Tandy had enjoyed relatively
little success in movies,
instead earning her sterling
reputation on stage and win-
ning three Tony awards in
the process. —- Reuters

None of these groups
received any information
about the move until it had
already been made, accord-
ing to Holland.

“It’s a strange way of
working when we’re proud
of our shared governance and
collegiality,” Holland said at
the assembly’s first meeting
of the academic year.

“I find it a real, real
concern, particularly given
the nature of the [Haley’s]
position  the magnitude of
the decision is startling to
me.”

According to Holland,
the position of vice chancel-
lor for student and public
affairs is one of six
whose salaries are deter-
mined by the board of
trustees’ compensation com-
mittee.

The others include the
chancellor, provost, senior
vice chancellor for health
sciences, senior vice
chancellor for health admin-
istration and senior vice
chancellor for business and

finance.
Holland said Senate stu-
dent affairs committee

chair Jonathan Schooler dis-
cussed Haley’s appointment
at the committee’s last meet-
ing.

He said Schooler knows

“This isn’t just a lack of a

Holland emphasized he

Stick to health reform

Last Wednesday, Rep. Jim McDermott, D—Wash., who has
been one of the major players in the health care debates,
called for Congress to give up on all efforts to reform health
care this year. Representative McDermott is only one of an
increasing number of congressmen who are calling for an end
to the health care debate this year.

There are a number of obstacles to health care reform hap-
pening before the end of the 1994 congressional session. For
one only a few weeks remain before Congress adjourns for
the year.

Furthermore, this is an election year, so all of the House
and one-third of the Senate seats will be put to a vote, giving
an added distraction to those Congressmen campaigning for
re-election. Also there has been anything but a constituent
backlash over the health care reform collapse. Senator Tom
Daschle, D-S.C., said that his constituents have gone from
“confused to opposed to ambivalent” on the issue, and The
New York Times reported that this has been a fairly consistent
reaction.

With all of these obstacles, including the sheer complexity
and enormity of the issue, it seems that health care reform is
all but dead this year.

The Pitt News feels this is another cop out on the part of
Congress. They still have the obligation to try and achieve
reform before the end of the term, because waiting until ‘95
would delay implementation by at least a year. .

What has happened to the “sense of urgency” we heard so
much about in August? For the ‘94 term to end “not with a
bang, but a whimper” is shameful. The November elections
may reshape the dynamics of both houses with the possibility
of Republican majorities, which would lead to more gridlock.
Now is the time for health care reform, not ‘95. l

Accolades to local media

The crash of USAir ﬂight 427 has touched the lives of many
of us in the past week. The Pitt News would like to take this
opportunity to express its condolences to all of the families dev-
astated by this horrible tragedy. We would also like to commend
the local media for handling the story with such tact.

With a news story of this magnitude it can be very tempting
for the television stations to try and out duel each other with
sensationalist pictures and reports. Thankfully they refrained
from this, showing a great deal of respect for the dead.

The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette also did a commendable job in
its coverage of the disaster. The Sunday edition included a 16-
page special report which included a retrospective on each vic-
tim which was certain to touch the lives of family members.

The Pitt News hopes the positive reaction to the coverage of
this disaster will spur the local media to cover other stories from
a less sensationalistic viewpoint. Perhaps we can all learn from
this disaster that well reported news sells too.

Brett first game
Fondrk with Texas,
although

there were glimpses of it last
season against Southem Mi.ss,
Syracuse and Rutgers.

It was especially evident
Saturday night against Ohio.

The trend is the team’s
innate ability to play at their
opponents’ level.

To clarify, the Panthers can
raise their level of play to that
of a ranked team (Texas) or
lower their performance to the
level of an inferior opponent
(Ohio) from week to week.

Week one saw Pitt give
19th-ranked Texas all they
could handle. The Panthers
played a great game and came
within a few yards of 'a tie or
even a win. ,

However, heading into the
game, the Panthers were sub-

stantial underdogs and few.

people thought they would be
able to keep the score
respectable, let alone contend
for a victory against the
mighty Longhorns.

Week two was a game that
Pitt was supposed to win.
Thankfully, for Panthers fans,
they did. Sure, it’s nice to get a
win. It’s even nicer to be at

' .500. But the victory seeming-

ly had a hollow ring to it.

Most felt that this game
would be a blowout. Ohio is in
the Mid-America Conference
with a degrading 4-7 record
last year. «A potential whipping
boy for Division I powers. On
paper, the only area that Ohio
seemed to have the edge was
with the play of~their band in
the pre—game. The OU band,
in fact, was quite a bit more
entertaining than the OU foot-
ball team. The Bobcats repeat-
edly failed to take advantage
of excellent field position and
their running game was nonex-
istent. However, OU quarter-
back Sam Vink was able to
exploit the Panther secondary
for 221 yards. 0

“The defense had significant
lulls,” Majors said. “They got
back in the game and threw
the ball on us.”

The 30-16 victory was com-
fortable but not substantial.
The game was not so comfort-
able late in the second half
when Ohio crept within seven
at 23-16.

J Control. In any sport, control

Whether it be control of your
opponent or control of your-
self, control is essential to win-
ning. ,

Yesterday the Pitt soccer
team took control of the game
against the State University of
New York at Buffalo and
escaped with a 4-3 victory.
Senior Eric Prex scored the
equalizer and go-ahead goals
in the last two minutes to seal
the fate of Buffalo.

“With five minutes left in
the game and us being down,
someone needed to take con-
trol,” Prex said. “I said to
myself that it might as well be
me.”

Take control is exactly what
Prex did. At 1:50 left in the
game, Prex controlled a loose
ball and fired it into the right

he said. .

Panthers stake themselves to a

possessions would’ve thought
the game was anything but dif-
ficult for Pitt.

Kicker David Merrick
opened the Panthers’ scoring
with a 44-yard field goal after
Pitt’s opening drive stalled at
the Bobcats’ 28.

After the Panthers’ defense
forced the Bobcats to punt, the
offense went to work begin-
ning at theirown 31. A 10-
yard scramble by quarterback
Sean Fitzgerald and a 15-yard
pass interference call against
the Bobcats highlighted the
Panthers’ move into Ohio ter-
ritory.

Fitzgerald followed a seven-
yard Martin run with two com-
pletions to split—end Billy
Davis of nine and 10 yards that
brought the Panthers down to
the Ohio 15.

Then on first down,
Fitzgerald hit a wide—open
Davis, who caught the sideline
pass near the five and trotted
into the end zone. It was
Davis’ fourth catch of the first

quarter. He finished the game

Pitt pounds Virginia, drops two of three of Michigan

By Adam Pincus
Staff Writer

Two days after playing the
top team in the nation, the Pitt
volleyball team found them-
selves in Ann Arbor, Mich.
where they were hoping to get
back on track against the likes
of Virginia, Michigan State
and host Michigan.

Friday night the Lady
Panthers lined up against UVA
in the weekend opener and
quickly found themselves trail-
ing the match two games to
none.

Pitt was down 9-3 in the
third game but was able to find
its rhythm and rally to win the
next three games to take the
match and raise their season
record to 2-2.

It is this type of intensity,
heart and pride that Pitt head
coach Cindy Alvear and the
team have been working on,
and their hard work paid off
against UVA.

Senior middle hitter Melanie
Gustafson had ll kills in the
match as did outside hitter
Carrie Thornton. Thornton
also led the way with 15 digs.
Sarah Mikla followed with 13,
and Sara Mitchell had 12.

However, that was Pitt’s first
and last win of the weekend as
they dropped both matches on
Saturday.

They were given a taste of
their own medicine on
Saturday morning when they
played Michigan State Pitt,
which had taken the first two
games by the scores of 15-13,

Annemarie Mernagh and co.
went "ﬂat" vs. Michigan St.

and 15-7, self—destructed from
that point on. MSU took the
next three games to win the
match, and Pitt lethargically
dropped to a game under .500.

Thornton led the way in this
match with 23 kills, and Sara
Mitchell had 27 digs to her
credit, but it was not enough as
Pitt faltered during the second
half of the match.

“Against Michigan State, we
had them down 2-0 and were
really in control of the match,”
Pitt assistant coach Brian
Begor said.

“Then in the third game, we
really were not prepared to
play. We were flat and it was a
very disappointing loss. We
were never able to recuperate
our intensity.”

Saturday night, Pitt faced

Michigan and lost a match that
was within their grasp. The
first game belonged to
Michigan as they won 15-12.
Pitt took game two by the
score of 15-13, and Michigan
took the next game by the
same score. However, in the
fourth and final game Pitt fell
apart, losing 15-1.

The Lady Panthers went 1-2
over the entire weekend, and
their overall record dropped to
2-4.

“Overall, the team is very
disappointed on the way they
performed,” Begor said.

“We lost our focus, we were
timid during critical moments
in the match. You can’t do that
against good opponents. We
worked hard for points and just
gave points away.

“People played well at cer-
tain times, and I think people
played well at certain parts of
the game,” Begor said.
“Overall, we really did not
have one player that had a
strong weekend.”

Head coach Cindy Alvear
said that she was not real
pleased with the serving in last
Wednesday’s Stanford game,
and Begor recognized some
similar problems this weekend.

“Really, the breakdown of
the tourney was with our pri-
mary passers. We just did not
serve or receive very well.

“Carrie Thornton had a cou-
ple of real strong matches, but
her ballhandling was nowhere
where we needed from a fifth-
year senior.”

One thing that Pitt is lacking
this year that they were not
lacking in years past is a big-
time player.

So Alvear said that she feels
the team must share more of a
team effort in order to be suc-
cessful.

Brian Begor shared Alvear’s
sentiments.

“We are the type of team
that, if we are not focused all
the time, we get to be pretty
average pretty quick,” Begor
said.

Senior Annemarie Mernagh
said she was also disappointed
by the loss and agreed that the
team must maintain its focus.

“Friday night everyone
played well,” Mernagh said.
“Saturday we had problems
with our service receive, and
when you don’t have a good
service receive you can’t run
an offense. So that was the
biggest part of our problem I
think.”

The Lady Panthers will play

their next game on Saturday as

they head down to the Robert
Morris Tournament, where
they will play Duquesne,
SUNY-Buffalo and Robert
Morris.

Heading West

Backup tailback performs like far in Martin's absence

By Keith Pompey
Senior Staff Writer

As fans packed into the stu-
dent section at Pitt stadium, all
eyes were on number 29.

Pitt’s student body won-
dered if Curtis Martin could

duplicate his 25l—yard effort-

against 19th ranked Texas.
But, with 10 minutes and 42
seconds left in the first half,

2 Martin went down with a right

ankle injury. His status report
stated he would be back only if
needed.

Sensing a moral victory, the

Ohio University defense began
to celebrate.

That’s when a tiny Panther
running back, by the name of
William “Billy” West IV, got
the call.

“The first thing on my mind
was I just had to relax,” West
said. “It was the second quar-
ter, so I just had to think about
pacing myself, trying to stay in
the whole game.

“I tried to stay under control.
Don’t try to go out of your
limits. Just run the play, get
what you can out of the play. If
you make a mistake then you
just make a mistake, and then
get ready for the next play.”

As Martin’s back-up took his
first handoff from Pitt quarter-
back Sean Fitzgerald, he

,_ exploded up the m_iddle for a

12-yard gain, stunning the
Bobcats.

Two plays later, West got
another chance. This time,
West put a delayed step on
three defenders. Next the
Smithfield, Ohio native pro-
ceeded to slice past two line-
backers. Then he drove past a
defensive back for a nine-yard
touchdown.

After that, things really start-

ed to heat up. The 5-foot—8-
inch, 195-pound sophomore
rushed the ball, 24 more times,
thus amassing a total of 226
yards.
All in all, West ran as though
possessed. He had the 12th-
best single-game rushing per-
formance in Panther history.

The son of a former NFL
defensive back for the Los
Angeles Raiders averaged an
impressive 8.6 yards per carry.
His longest was a 32-yard
scamper.

This time it was West, not
Martin, who proved to be a
major factor in Pitt’s (1-1) 30-

16 victory over Ohio
University (0-1).
“I think that Billy West came

and played like a starter
today,” Panther free safety
David Sumner said. “I don’t
think you can ask for anything
more. I think he did more and
beyond what was asked of
him. I think he is just going to
get better. The way I see it
now, he is going to be our back
for next year. The way I see it,
he is getting good experience.”

This was not the only game
in which West got some valu-

able experience.

On October 28, I993, two
hours before Pitt was about to
face Rutgers, West was told he
was about to start his first col-
legiate game.

“I was nervous,” West
recalls. “It was a big game for
us on national TV.”

As the final gun sounded, it
was evident that he had
responded to the challenge.

West rushed 20 times for
108 yards, also scoring two
TD’s. His heroics helped Pitt
win its second of three games
of the season by whipping the
Scarlet Knights 21-10.

Despite these two big—time
games, West is satisfied with

his role.

“I still have to look at my
role,” West, who rushed for
244 yards last year, said. “I am
still Curt’s backup. I am going
to play as they want me to
play. If that means more car-
ries, than that’s what I am

Women 'sfennis team
earns weekend sp/It

By Brady Slater
Staff Writer

The Pitt women’s tennis
team opened its season by
splitting a pair of matches this
weekend at the Cost Center.

On Saturday, the women fell
to a tough team from Mt. Saint
Mary’s College of Maryland,
5-0.

“They were strong,” head
coach George Dieffenbach
said.

“But we held our own. We
were competitive in every
match. We looked a lot
stronger than the score really
showed.” '

Those strengths that
Dieffenbach spoke of showed
on Sunday, when the Pitt (1-1)
women came from behind to
beat the University of Buffalo,
5-4.-

“It was one of the closest

matches I’ve ever seen at Pitt,”
Dieffenbach said. “It took ﬁve
hours and 15 minutes to com-
plete.”

Down 4-3 with two doubles
matches remaining, the Lady
Panthers
needed
to, and
  -, did, win
“°  the last

‘*5-'5 t w o
7 matches.
' “ W e
want to
win a match like that be-
cause it gives us a real
morale booster,” Dieffenbach
said.

“It was a very good team
effort and a good way to even
our record a .500.”

‘Overall Dieffenbach was sat-
isﬁed with the team’s start, but
he said, “I know we can do
better.”

Men's tennis sweeps top seeds

By Tawnya Adams
For The Pitt News

The Pitt men’s tennis team
went down to the wire to pull
out a win over Mt. Saint
Mary’s College, of Maryland,
Saturday at the Cost Center.

The top seat singles match or
the doubles match had to win
in order for the whole team to
come out on top. They both
won, giving the men their first
win, 4-1, of the 1994-95 sea-
son.

Head coach George
Dieffenbach was very pleased
with his team’s performance.
“It was a team effort,” he said.

Pitt (1-0) even got an impor-
tant victory when its No. 3
player won despite being ill
with a sore throat Saturday.

“If we would have lost that
point, the whole confidence of
the team would have been
down,” Dieffenbach said.

Braden Doherty, the No. 1
player on the team, had an

intense match. He was down

, going into the second set, 4-6,

but came back and won his last
two sets 6-3, 6-3. He felt he
had a “pretty solid perfor-
mance and that it was a good
way to get the season started.”

Mt. Saint Mary’s had played
Duquense University earlier in
the day. Genuan
Gunawardhana, Doherty’s
opponent, said being tired was
no excuse for losing.

“Braden just gave me good
competition,” Gunawardhana
said.

Brad Wade, the No. 2 player
on the team, also won his
match, 6-3, 7-5.

“Brad had a very excellent
match. It was tight but he
moved well and stayed aggres-
sive,” Dieffenbach said.

Mills, who was moved from
the No. 6 position to the No. 3
position, won his match.

“Iserved great, and that’s
what won it for me. My oppo-
nent and Braden’s got pretty

tired at the end because of the
game they had earlier,” Mills
said.

The doubles team of Anirban
Munkerjee, a senior, and Neil
Bose, a freshman, played the
No. 3 spot and clinched their
match.

“This was their first time
playing together, and they did
a good job,” Dieffenbach said.

Cyrus Zolghadri, a junior on
the team, said, “The team is
really spirited, and everyone
supported one another.”

Practice for the team started
a half an hour earlier than
usual this week. Dieffenbach
thought the players’ perfor-
mances showed an improve-
ment because of this change.

“We are a little more ahead
in the season than we were last
year at this time. The team has
to learn not to give in mentally.
Braden is very good at
this, now the rest of the guys
need to follow,” Dieffenbach
said.

making sure everybody is
ready to play. That is some-
thing good we have.”

When it comes to preparing
for a game, West feels differ-
ently, because he never knows
if he is going to get a couple
plays or not.

“As a backup, sometimes it
is hard to get ready,” West
said. “I just try to go through
the week and keep up with the
offensive game plan and
things.” _

As Martin’s protégé, West
followed his elder’s lead as he
gave credit to his offensive
line, which played without
All-American candidate
Reuben Brown, for his record
setting performance.

“Our offensive line really
controlled it up front,” he said.
“.[The Bobcats ] were running
a lot of stunts on the outside.
They really picked them up
well and we were effective on
the ground.” -

But one thing that has been
proven before is that when
West is given a chance, he
does not perform as a backup.

This is the kind of “excite-
ment” that Pitt must learn to
avoid. In order to gain
respectability, they must beat
the Ohios and Temples of the
college world soundly. A. good
blowout can do wonders for a
team. Starters get a rest,
coaches can try new plays and
younger players can get valu-
able playing time.

The difference between a
decent team and great team is
the ability to win the games

they are supposed to.

“Jeff’s goal was the biggest

“Having him back in the line-
up is great for us.”

“Jeff did a great job for us
today,” Luxbacher said.

The SUNY Buffalo team did
not roll over and die. After a

35 held by head coach
Luxbacher.

The Panthers have extended
their record to 2-0 with just
one week of the Big East
opener at Georgetown.

“We played a poor, poor
game defensively,” Luxbacher
said. “We had too many men-
tal mistakes from some veteran
players that we are looking to
for leadership. The veteran
players need to come
through,” Luxbacher said.

As for the rest of the season,
“We are taking it one game at

“I am looking forward to the
start of the Big East

want to make it to the
NCAA’s.”

Pitt’s next opponent is cross-

“CMU is a tough team, and
we will not be successful if we

half, Pitt looked on its way to
an easy victory. That was until
the Bobcats took possession
following the Panthers’ first
punt with 5:38 on the clock at
their own 17.

The Bobcats used a balanced
attack getting into Pitt territo-
ry. Then on a third and 14 at

receiver Casey Gayle for 26

A roughing the passer call
against Pitt on the play moved

200 N. Braddock Ave., Pittsburgh, PA 15208

Near the intersections of Braddock 8: Penn Avenues

 
  

Goss.

The drive stalled there, but
Scott Roberts’ 30-yard field
goal made it 20-10 Pitt.

Pitt junior Mark Butler
returned the ensuing kickoff 36
yards to the Pitt 45. A 12-yard
pass from Fitzgerald to Davis
followed by four West runs
totalling 32 yards brought the
ball to the Ohio 11.

An incompletion on third
and three forced the Panthers
to go to Merrick, who kicked
the 28-yard field goal making
it 23- 10 Pitt.

The Bobcats got the ball
back and moved to the
Panthers 29, behind a 11-yard
scramble by Vink and a 20-
yard completion from Vink to
Goss.

With first and 10 from the
29, Vink hit a wide open Gayle
streaking down the sideline for
the score. The point after try
failed, leaving the score 23-16

-with :45 left in the third quar-

ter.

"‘Our defense hit a signifi-
cant lull when they got back in
the game and threw the ball on
us,” Majors said.

“I’d have liked our guys a
little closer to the ball when
they caught it.”

Nothing was easy for the
Panthers as they entered the
fourth quarter, their 20-point
lead dwindled to a touchdown.

“Realistically, I thought
tonight if we played well, if we
could hang in there and if we
stayed close we’d have a
chance to win,” Ohio head
coach Tom Lichtenberg said.

‘ Then with 10:11 left in the
game, Pitt took possession at
their seven and put together
the game’s most impressive

2 drive.

Using West almost exclu-
sively the Panthers moved the
ball to the Ohio 30, highlight-
ed by West’s 32-yard sideline
scamper.

Then with West out of the

game, Tim Colicchio burst :

through the right side of the
line and into the end zone from
23 yards out.

The 13-play drive went for
93 yards, ate 6:24 seconds off
the clock and put Pitt up for
good 30-16. _

“Overall I’m very pleased to
win this game,” Majors said of
his first home victory with the
Panthers since 1976.

“I have a lot‘ of respect for
the way our team started off.
But they came back in _the
game, and I will say this with
all the earnestness that I can
say, I was really impressed

_ with Ohio University.”
