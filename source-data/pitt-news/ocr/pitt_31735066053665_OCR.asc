Blee takes the reigns as Pitt's
new women ’s studies director

ctrole Lynn Gerl

 

. S. V‘?

. Pitt’s department of women’s stud-
ies has hired Professor Kathleen Blee,
formerly of the University of Kentucky,
as its new director.

Blee has come to Pitt after serving
15 years as the women’s studies director
and professor at the University of
Kentucky, where she was director of
women’s studies, assistant director of
the College of Arts and Science, and a
professor in sociology.

“One of the main reasons I decided
to leave the University of Kentucky and
come to Pitt was the very diverse and
exciting program Pitt has to offer for
women. They have a very good under-
graduate program that makes me happy
to be here,” Blee said.

She also likes the idea of the diver-
sity of students she has to work with in
her sociology classes. .

Blee plans on continuing with her
research on women and history along
with making some improvements on the
women’s studies program.

“With just being here a week, it is
hard to see how many changes are need-
ed, but one area that I plan to develop
and improve on is the graduate pro-
gram,” Blee said.

Besides teaching and working as the

 

new director, Blee has also done
research in women and history. She has
written a couple of books dealing with
gender, race, and class between men and
women.

Her most recent research deals with
the increase of poverty among women
and children. She dealt with this issue
mainly by investigating the labor force.

“I studied the labor force on the
lower-level sector, such as waitresses,
busboys, and McDonald’s employees,”
said Blee. “It seems that there is a
demand for such employees, where
there are no beneﬁts and low pay.”

Her study revealed that there are far
more women in these positions, and the
number keeps growing.

“Women and minorities get trapped
in these positions compared to white
men who use these types of jobs as a
springboard and get out,” Blee said.

The other area of research deals
with interviewing women in “clans,”
such as skinhead organizations and
street gangs.

“This study took two years of
research because these women are hid-
den and hard to find,” Blee said.

“Women who are becoming more
involved with gangs are just as, or some-
times more, violent than men. There are
many skinhead gangs in the west coast
that are strictly women,” Blee said.

If you walk around Oakland armed
with pepper spray and a whistle, you’ll be
relieved to hear that the Pitt police has added
six new police officers to their squad this
fall.

An additional four or ﬁve oﬂicers may
be hired later this year in conjunction with
the provost’s “Quality of Life” plan to

- enhance campus safety.

Students say they have felt a very posi-

police officers have been on duty. When

After our first encounters with
store management and leaﬂetting, our
work got a little more intense. The sec-
ond week, we stayed in Lansing, Mich.
for several days and worked with
United Food and Commercial Workers
(UFCW).

Together with the UFCW in
Detroit local 876, we did lots of “blitz-
ing,” which is when you get employee
information about the union you’re
working with. We went into stores and
found employees on the ﬂoor to talk
with them about their jobs.

We were able to ask them a few
basic questions, like how long they’d
been working, what their wages, bene-
fits, and hours were like, how they got
along with their boss, and so on.

Then once they ‘were talking. and
thinking about their job, we gave them
the ‘_‘Beneﬁts of a Union” talk and
handed them the information. This all
had to happen very quickly, before the
management caught on.

The first time I did it was terrify-
ing. We didn’t really get much train-
ing, and I had to walk right up and talk
about the union to an employee who

was already afraid of it. I hate selling

asked how safe she felt on campus, student

Emily Borgett, a freshman, said she already -

felt comfortable walking around the cam-
pus.

“I don’t have any problems. I feel safe.
One night I was waiting for friends on the
street comer — I was sitting on the curb,
and four Pitt police stopped and asked if I

According to Chief Rick Boyd, the
new recruits are the best of over 100 appli-
cants. g

UNION SUMMER — Part2 of 2

Student shares dilemmas
of union promotion tactics

things, and I’ve always thought that
things like this were pretty slimy, but I
did it anyway. V

Well, we all got pretty good at get-
ting kicked out "of stores. I got to see
genuine fear. I actually had one
Montgomery Ward employee refuse
information and then say, “The carn-
eras! They’ve got cameras! They’re
watching us!”

After this woman decided to walk
with us and “show us some bags,” we
slipped the information to her, and she
seemed really grateful. That was the
most memorable and incredible expe-
rience I had. ,

Before we went to blitz, “salters”
(union members who get jobs under-
cover to scope out potential union con-
tracts and instigate union organization
at a particularly crummy place) and
other union members shared their per-
sonal experiences about management
anti-union propaganda. ,

According "to salters, employers
hold “captive audience meetings,_”
where, once they feel there is‘ a signif-
icant union threat, they gather all the
employees together and commend
workers for smaller things (like perfect
attendance) in order to gloss over the
actual issues of beneﬁts and wages.

Union 

It satisﬁes employees, who begin to
think, “Yeah, my boss is my friend.”
Sometimes, _the salters said, manage-
ment will even grant temporary raises,
which are soon revoked.

Later in the week, we did the ﬁrst—
ever “mall crawl.” This is a sort of
guerilla tactic where we went in pairs to
stores that were still advertising in the
Detroit newspapers. On July 13, 1995,
all of the six unions involved in the pro-
duction and distribution of the Detroit
News and the Detroit Free—Press went
on strike. This was after the companies
controlling them, Knight-Rider and
Garmet, slowly made most of the work-
ers part—time, and cut back on staff. The
companies then refused to negotiate for
anew contract with the unions. Since
then, they have been, and still are, on
strike.

For the mall crawl, we took ﬂyers
under our shirts into the offending
stores. The ﬂyers explained that these
stores were supporting “scab papers” —
papers using temporary labor to ﬁll the
strikers’ positions —— and that they were
being boycotted. The object was to stuff
ﬂyers all over the place —— in pockets,
shoe boxes, and on racks — without
getting caught.

This is where Barry got arrested.

We were all expecting to be
approached by management or a securi-
ty guard, but the others in my group,
Barry, Matt, and Mark, were all
approached individually by cops.

When asked for his ID, Barry said,
“I know my rights. I don’t have to show
you anything. I’m leaving.” Well, he
was wrong, and they cuffed and arrested
him for disorderly conduct and disobey-
ing a verbal command. We had to post
$100 bail for him.

FROM PAGE 1

After the mall crawl, we did some
scab marches, where we went into
replacement workers’ neighborhoods
and marched around chanting that they

the strikers.

I began to question the productivity
of these actions.

At the mall crawl, we were actually
making a mess for the workers to clean
up. They were not our target; manage-
ment was. Yes, we were putting out
information for the customers, but

all be picked up in a matter of minutes.

As for scab marches, we successful-
ly angered not only the scabs, but also
the neighbors. Did we want to make
enemies or gain sympathy?

To wrap it up, most of the union
workers whom we actually dealt with
were, I believe, very sincere about their
desire to help all working people.

However, I’m not sure about all the
tactics used to promote union support. I
see how these bases at the locals are
becoming stronger with minorities and
women, and they are more understand-
ing of white men (who take a lot of
slack for being white and men). Despite
the ever-existing sexism, racism, and
indifference in some of the locals, I’m
happy to say that it appears to me that
unions are changing for the better —
from the bottom up.

People have been mistaking yesterday’s
insert entitled “She’s A Child Not A ‘Choice”’
as a part of The Pitt News, when in fact, it was
a paid advertisement.

Anyone who chooses to look at this ad
closely will see that the insert is labeled in the
left-hand corner as an “advertising supple-
ment.” That is to say, that the Human Life
Alliance of Minnesota Education Fund Inc. took
out an advertisement in The Pitt News — an
option that is open to any person, organization,
or private company that is willing to pay for it.

The Pitt News does not discriminate in its
acceptance of advertisements.\ If we had
received a pro-choice insert in lieu of a pro-life
ad, it would also have been accepted.

Our readers need to realize that in order to
provide them with a free student newspaper, we
must accept such advertisements. These adver-
tisements are the currency with which the news-
paper is printed.

The Human Life Alliance insert is not con-
nected with The Pitt News editorial board or its
opinions in any way, shape, or form. The edito-
rial board does not wish to come out on either
side of the abortion issue at this time.

The advertiser assumes full responsibility
for everything contained in the insert. Any
questions or complaints should be directed to
them.

I live and work in one of the
small (not picturesque, unfortunately)
towns about 40 miles from campus.
My house is of reasonable size and
quite comfortable, but the reason the
rentissocheapisthattheareaisa“bit
mixed,” as my landlord describes it.
Where I am ﬁom, we would simply
say it was “well dodgy.” Despite this,
however, I never lock my car, and I
leave the backdoor open, unless over-
corrre by a ﬁt of paranoia. It has been
my experience that there are several
ways in which paranoia is induced
Chernically-induced paranoia is
instanﬂy recognizable as such, and
assuming one still has at least two
neurons which ﬁre in sequence, one
sirrrply dismisses such paranoia with
a harsh lecture to the self upon the
wages of sin, etc. The other kind of
paranoia is chemically free and
brought on by seemingly strange
events or persons who appear on
one’s horizon.

For example, there is that one
strange neighbor guy who always
stops to say, “Hi honey,” (leer), “is
your husband home?”

“Oh yes,” I say, “actually, he is
lifting weights in the basement and
polishing his guns, since you ask.” I

charitably assume him to bea harm-

less mental defective with limited
powers of conversation, butI suppose
he could be the next Jeffrey Dahmer.
Even if that is the case, I should be
reasonably safe since the neighbors of

serial murderers always say, “He was .

so quiet. He seemed shy. We had no
idea.”
As for my other neighbors, well,

August. (Remember, it did not rain
for 30 days and was 100 degrees. I
always move in August because I
happen to enjoy messing wiﬂr the
sodium/potassium balance of my
body. Call it a cheap high, but, hey,
it’s legal.) Mariarme and I had my
kitchen table stuck irnrnovably in the
doorway. Leaning limply on the
porch, I realized the gravity of the sit-
uation. She was stuck hopelessly
inside and I outside. After the obliga-
tory gasping—for-air-and-mopping-up
of-sweat break, she spoke decisively.
“Wrench. Legs off.” She rolled her
eyes meaningfully in the direction of
my new neighbors, plainly indicating
that I was going to have to do some-
thing. She disappeared into the cool
depths of the basement I hoped she
had gone to get some secret stash of
beer

“Hi, I’m your new neighbor. Can
I borrow a wrench?” Not liking the
sound of my voice saying those
words, I prevaricated by lighting a
cigarette while surreptitiously check-
ing out the neighbor situation.

Anyway, the neighbors consisted
of, on the one side, a motley crew of
ﬁve females of assorted age and

unirnaginable genetic descent, and

one toothless male, sitting on their
porches respectively and watching
the entertainment provided by me
and Mariarme. She reappeared from
the basement, canying a couple of
cold ones. I gave silent thanks to the
Cosmos, and popped the top. Her
gaze followed mine to next door’s
porch. “Forget it,” she hissed, “no
way. He’s not gomra have a wrench.

I looked in the other direction. At
ﬁrst glance, what I saw was a little
more promising. Naked from the
waist up was a very loud and vocal
young man whose ego was, evident-
ly, heavily invested in ﬁxing(?) the
steady stream of dilapidated cars that
were towed, pushed, and carried
piecemeal into his grubby garage. He
was pretty grubby too, but then, so
was I. Deﬁnitely, this man will have a
wrench, I thought. Even better, he
might offer to come and take the legs
off for me! And in fact, that is just
how it turned out. I even met his wife
and baby, one of whom looked like a
very large slab of unbaked Pillsbury
dough while the other looked like a

tiny scrap of unbaked Pillsbury.

dough. If the child’s appearance
favored the distaif side in looks, then
its vocal tendencies were deﬁnitely
from the pater; in short, it was a hate-
ful recombination of genes. Marianne
laughed, but she said I was cruel,
mean, and a snob. I was shocked.

Now, my current neighbors may
leave something to be desired, pos-
session of wrench notwithstanding,
but Marianne is a classic example of
the gold that can be mined ﬁom
neighbors when you luck out. It was
a long time ago that she was my
neighbor and has long since turned
into a most excellent friend. She dia-
pered my babies and spoon-fed me
when I was sick; she brings food and
gifts almost every time she comes
around; she cleans up my kitchen;
and she encourages me when I am
down — not to mention helping me
to move on 100 degree days in
August. Now with ﬁiends like this,
who needs neighbors?

comes to mind

Twelve wins in the past four years‘ and
two weeks do not a dynasty make, nor a tradi-
tion continue. But there is one thing that still
lingers ﬁom the team’s more successful past.
Real fans know it Freshmen get con-

‘ fused by it. It’s grown so big ﬂiat fans at bas-

ketball games have pirated it away even
though it doesn’t apply to them in the slightest

N 0. It’s not that Village People dance; but
you’re close.

Before every contest, the Pitt Band plays
the ﬁght song. Before every contest, the audi-
ence is invited to sing the words. The words,
of course, are “P-I-T-T, Let’s go Pitt!” But you
wouldn’t know that unless you had an original
lyric sheet.

Instead, fans take this opportunity to
make a derogatory comment about our ﬁne
feline friends ﬁom Happy Valley. Now that’s
tradition. It’s so ingrained, you’d think that
Penn State blew up a shuttle bus, or beat up
Panther Paul, or did someﬂring equally as
awful in the far-off past.

You’d also think we were still playing
Penn State. Which, in a way, we are. 1

While, thankfully, we don’t have to suffer
the potential bloodletling of a PSU—Pitt foot-
ball game this season (masochists rejoice —
there’s always next year), Pitt is currenﬂy los-
ing an even bigger battle to the Nittany Lions
— the recruiting battle.

According to Sports Illustrated, the
Nittany Lions are the beneﬁciaries of the num-
ber-one recruiting class in the nation this sea-
son. The Penn State sphere of inﬂuence has
expanded as far east as New Jersey, as far
north as New York, as far south as Maryland,
and as far west as Ohio.

As far west as Ohio.

Does anybody else see a problem with
this? For the non-geography majors, this
would put Pitt ﬁrmly inside the Bermuda

THE PITT NEWS

 

Bobby, Mike, and Jeff Dyer all share
something in common with their father
besides a last name. They all played
Division I sports at the University of
Pittsburgh.

The three most recent Dyers have
started quite a legacy on the Panther soccer
team. Bobby, who graduated two years
ago, set the tone. Mike, a senior and this
year’s captain, and Jeff, now a freshman,

carry on the family tradition which their I

father passed on to them after his football
days at Pitt.

Mike came into this season as a
fourth—year starter with great expectations.
He is listed as a defenseman, but Coach
Joe Luxbacher said he has some offensive
talent along with his strong defensive abil-
ity. He classiﬁed Mike as an “attack
defender.” He is very quick and has started
out the season well, except for a red card
he received last week for what he called
dissent. This disappointed Mike, who is a
ﬁerce competitor and wants to play. ’

Mike has started 43 games at Pitt,
including 17 games as a ﬁeshrnan, dishing
out two assists. His sophomore year, he
scored his ﬁrst collegiate goal (against
Canisius) and registered ﬁve assists. Last
year, he started the ﬁrst eight games before
breaking ‘-the ﬁfth metatarsal of his left
foot. The injury required season-ending
surgery. ‘

When asked about last season, the
best in Panther soccer history, Mike said
that they really did not accomplish any-
thing because they won no titles and did

not qualify for the playoffs. The ﬁerce
competitor expects’ more from this year’s
team and from himself. He said that his
goal is to not give up any goals this year as
a defenseman, and if the offense comes,
that is a plus. He also showed his compet-
itive side when speaking of the ﬁrst couple
of games. He stated that the Panthers
should have shut out their ﬁrst two oppo-
nents. ’
Mike is not the only Dyer impacting
the team this year. The Panthers lost their
starting sweeper, Travis Kruse, to an
injury. His condition is listed as day-to-
day, but this gives Jeﬁ” Dyer his chance to

be held ﬁom 1:30-3 pm.

Admission to the event will be $3.00

under. Everyone attending the sale and auc-
tion will also receive a coupon good for a
50% discount on tickets purchased that day

Coach Luxbacher had hoped to give
Jeff more time to develop since he is a
freshman just coming into the program,
but he said, “Jeff was thrown into the ﬁre

right away, and for now he is the man.”

Jeff will continue to play until Travis
can come back. When that happens, no
one knows what will happen to Jelf, but
Mike is sure that “Jeﬂ will ﬁt in some-

where.”

Having two players doing well at their

Triangle of PSU recruiting.

Proof? According to the same reputable
magazine, three players from Pittsburgh high
schools registered in the top 25 seniors in the
nation. Two have already unofﬁcially pledged
allegiance to the Nittany Lions. The other one
is seriously considering it.

. A few years removed from the gridiron,
and Happy Valley is still ﬁnding new and
interesting ways to bury Pitt football. VV1thout
recruits, it’s tough to build a winning program
Without a winning program, it’s tough to
rebuild a recruiting area And so on.

Back in prehistoric times (like the nrid—
’70s), Pitt and Penn State lived in a peaceﬁil
coexistence, offering two choices to the elite
players of talent—rich western Pemrsylvania.
Pitt still‘ grabs a few of these kids, but as
Panther football drops off the map, more and
more of them are growing up with Joe Patemo
posters in their roorrrs.

As if this wasn’t bad enough, the rest of
Pantherville is being eaten alive by other pro-
grams. The Mountaineers are invading Pitt’s
diminished recruiting area from the south,
while the Ohio State Buckeyes are creeping
farther and farther over the border. Even
Syracuse has a limited inﬂuence in Erie and
other areas to the north.

Baning the occasional ﬂuke recruit ﬁom
Califomia or Mars, ﬂie Panthers have always
gotten and will always get the bulk of their
squad locally. Teams without a local recruiting
base have little chance at becoming a national
rrragrret like Notre Dame or Miami, nor can
they rise to bowl—garne -level, like West

Or Pitt, a few years ago. To get some kind
of gridiron competitiveness back, the Panthers
need to show the local kids a bit more than
spacious locker room facilities or clean dorms
or nice classrooms — they need to show them
a big win.

of a ranked opponent would do the trick. Any
performance of this squad above the current
Keystone Kops, level of football it’s been
showing would be an improvement, even if it
just meant a close game with a well—known
squad

The best show would be a miracle against
Penn State at Beaver Stadium, but we have to
wait a year for that.

the role very well, according to his coach
and his brother.

Coach Luxbacher said, “Jeff has come
up big.”

This is quite a compliment for a fresh-
man to get from his coach.

Luxbacher said that Jeff and Bobby are
very similar players. While Mike breaks
the Dyer mold, Jeff and Bobby are both
very strong—rrrinded defensive players.
Mike has a little offensive touch to add to
his strong defensive prowess.

These three players from Peters
Township High School have all stepped in
to do a great job for the Panthers, bringing
experience and leadership to the team.
Who knows what this year holds in store
for the team, but one can be sure the Dyers
will play a role in whatever happens as their
