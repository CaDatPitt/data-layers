Two spring concerts

Program -BAS Show Nixed p

BY LISA RUBENSTEIN

Pitt students will have the
opportunity to go to two spring
concerts this year instead of the
single Student Government Pro-
gramming-Black Action Society
(BAS) show originally slated for
this term.

The controversial idea for a
co-spon-sored concert by the two
groups has been disbanded by the
Student Government Board (SGB).
In a meeting Wednesday night,
SGB voted to pull back the $15,896
allocated for the show from‘ the
programming account and return
the money to the general fund.

According‘ to ‘SGB President
Bernie Payne, the Board will
entertain emergency budget re-
quests from the two groups to allow
each to produce its own concert.

SGB Plans»-
New Student ~
Services

BY PETE DICKS

Bernie Payne, Pittis newly
elected Student Government Board
(SGB) president. said recently that
his administration will strive to
initiate several useful .programs
and services. such as a student
buying power card, which would
enable students to receive dis-
counts at selected area stores.

“Hopefully. we could have the
student buying power card ready
by fall registration (March 14) or at
least by September," Payne said,
adding that the contracts have not
been signed with all of the stores

(Continued on Page 2)

“Just because the groups
couldn't work together there was
no reason the entire student body
should suffer,” SGB member
Ahmie Baum said yesterday. “We
decided to pull back the money

and allow the two shows or there
wouldn't have been any spring
concert at all." ’

The production schedule for the
spring concert had been delayed
due to snags in the selection of the
groups, members of BAS and
Programming reported earlier this
week.

SG Concert Programming Co-
chairman Tim Stoops said yester-
day the committee was happy with
the SGB’s decision to allow two
spring concerts. “We told- last

year’s Board, when the idea

originally emerged, that we didn't
think we could co-produce the
show."

He said the committee would put
together a moderately priced Syria
Mosque show with their allocation
of the spring concert money.

Concert’ Programming Co—chair- \
man Andy Coleman said the Board .

should have taken action earlier in
ligtht of the problems created by
co-production of the Freddie
Hubbard concert for Black Week
last term. That concert was made
free to students the week of the
concert due to low ticket sales.

BAS Programming Chairperson
Joy Wilson had no comment when
contacted yesterday about SGB’s
action.

Campus Crime Down In '76

, BY PAUL MATHEWS

Crime on, campus decreased

' last year for the first time in 16 years

with theft remaining the number
one criminal offense, ‘according to
campus Police Chief Curt Graham.
Graham said according to the
department's finalv report, which
will be released soon, campus
crime decreased 7.9 percent last
year »with most crimes occurring
between the hours of 8 p.m. and 2
a.m. He said the frequency ofcrime
decreases at 2 a.m. because that’s
when bars close. ~
Criminal mischief-vandalism-—
was the second most. prevaienit
crime on campus last year, Graham
said. Assaults were also‘ prevalent,
but, according to Graham, 80
percent of all assaults involve
people who know each other,

Nixon's Power Abuse

 Subject of   Dean Speech

' ‘ 1973, I

  
  
  

BY LESLEY SAYELL

John Dean III, disbarred attorney
and former legal counsel to

ex-President Nixon,said he came '

forward to testify in 1973 when he
realized the ends no longer justified
the means.

Dean, who spoke yesterday at a
gathering of Allegheny County

’ lawyers in the William Penn Hotel,

said in the Nixon White House,
“There was a total disregard‘ for
anything other than achieving an
end—the means became whatever
expediency dictated.-”

f‘I ﬁnally did get the guts to come
forward.” Dean_ said. “But as. late

incapable of doing it. That is why
I’m very curious to see what he says
in his book and in the David Frost
interview,” Dean said.

The substance of power was
difficult to separate from the form of
power in the Nixon White House,
Dean said. This is when he decided
to go to the prosecutors. ,

Dean explained how the White
House scandal began long before he
testified before the Senate judiciary
committee in 1974. In April of 1971,
after Richard Nixon studied his ’72
campaign plans, he ‘told Bob
Haldeman ttltat in 1972 he wanted a

‘better politic:al intelligence gather-
ing operation: for the campaign than
he had in.19_68. .  '_ ’

incidents were uncommon, he said.

Graham said crimes related to
hitchhiking are on the decrease. He
said this is because fewer people
seem to be hitchhiking today,‘ as
opposed to previous years ‘_‘when
at any giventime one could drive
down Forbes Avenue and see at
least 20 hitchhikers"; He said the
decrease in hitchhiking is probably
a result of education and the fact

Food Co-op Gets Fresh Start‘

BY RANDY GAYSEK

The Student Government food
co-op, back in operation this week
under revamped organization, is
running smoothlyuco-op member
Barry Schwartz said yesterday.

The co-op, initiated by last year's
Student Government Board, closed
in November due to organizational
problems.’

Schwartz, a former member of
the steering committee which kept
the co-op going after last term’s
closing, said ‘people “really seem
happy that we’re back.”

This week we had 118 orders and l

10 people were here waiting for us
to open up this morning," he said.

New organization has helped
expedite the system by eliminating
“pre-bagging” of orders and
allowing room for expansion,
Schwartz said.

“Next week we’re offering twice
as many cheeses as we did this
week.” he said.

Orders can be placed in the
Student Union Art Gallery on
Mondays and Tuesdays_ from 11:00
a.m. to 4:00 p.m. and will be filled
from 10:00 a.m. to 5:00 on
Thursdays. . H

weeks we can go to a system where
people can order on Thursday, too,

victimized while hitchhiking.

Graham also reported yesterday
that the campus police released a

crime prevention.

“We had a 2.200 limit for the ~ 0

years. This gives us some

ﬂexibility for the upperclassmen 
who change their minds over the ’

summer about living in the
dormitories." Hughes said.

According to Hughes, the 2,200 SH

allotment takes into consideration
the new living quarters to be
developed from renovations. at
Holland Hall and the converted
Lothrop Lounges. Also. rooms will
be available at the Hotel Webster
Hall,

. “We have gained a committment lb

from Webster Hall for the space we
already have," Hughes said. “We.
hope to amplify that space for the
fall but no settlement has been
reached."

According to the Housing Office, ‘
waiting list students who do, not '

receive housing in the dormitories
will have their deposits refunded.

Co-op member Barry Schwartz is optimistic the food co-op will be more
successful this term than last because of structural and organizational

changes in its operation.

Schwartz pointed out the advan-

tages the food co-op has over,

which have expressed interest in
the program.

The card would be issued free to
all interested students, but the
amount of the discount would be
set individually by stores in
Oakland and Shadyside, the two_
areas of the city with the greatest
concentration of Pitt students.

Payne said the SGB public
affairs department is working
toward publishing a “student
survival kit," a comprehensive
student guide that would include
information- and suggestions for
both residents and commuters.

‘‘It would be the one book where

you could go and get it all. instead
of going to many different packets
and pamphlets of information. We
hope to have it out by next winter
term," Payne said.

Oakland's parking problem will
also be confronted, Payne said,
although Mayor Flaherty’s nomina-
tion to the post of U.S. deputy
attorney general may cause several
shake-ups in city government, thus
hampering the efforts of Chip
Hubbard, the SGB member investi-
Eating the parking problem, to
elicit affirmative action from local
officials. ‘

Payne commented on the park-
ing problem, “One of the things

that later resulted in a break-in at
the Democratic headquarters.”
Dean said.

Dean said, of his White I-Iousr
years. “I learned things that I
should have probably known and

, learned them in a rather difficult

way. Trained as a lawyer. I should
have certainly known more about
criminal justice and about the way
it operates.

‘ ‘I really didn't know that you had
to be a criminal lawyer to be counsel
to the President. Where I learned
my criminal law I wouldn't suggest
anybody to go there to learn it. The
experience of going to prison. for
example, wasn't one of those
country clubs they talked about in
the newspapers.”

Dean does not hold to the belief
that prisons rehabilitate prisoners.
‘‘I never found one-prisoner coming
through where I had been who
didn’t look at the rehabilitation
program as anything other than a
way to help him get out—if he did
well in his program, then he thought

it might help him to get parole

earlier," Dean said.

Dean served only four months in a
prison near Washington. “No one
could have been more surprised or
delighted that my term was as brief
as it was, ’ ’ Dean said. ‘ ‘I remember
writing to some friends of mine that
I hoped next Christmas I wouldn’t
be lifting weights with four Mafia
hitmen." he said.

“But I guarantee that the
criminal justice system is not
working,” Dean said. “When
young people serve nine to 12 years
on drug charges and I only do four
months for what I was involved
in—it’s just not working.”

At the age of 31, Dean has
received great exposure for his
Watergate involvement. Dean
realizes that people want to know
why he is paid for speaking about
crimes he was involved in.

“This is something that not only
troubles other people—it also
troubles me,” Dean said. “The
only way I can handle that is to try
notto abuse the whole thing. I don ’t
do one-one hundredth of the
lecturing my booking agents can
schedule for me,” he said.

Payne also explained the reason

he delegated specific duties to the ,_ 

SGB members in a manner similiar
to that proposed by the recently
defeated referendum two.

He said that the stigma of the
words “vice president," which
appeared on the referendum ballot,
may have confused voters; he feels
that by designating specific re-
sponsibilities he will best carry out
the duties of his office.

“We have assigned various
duties to different Board mem-
bers," Payne said. “not so they
can't step out of those areas, but
this way we always have someone
to hold accountable.”

leased to various student and
administrative groups, such as the
Student Government Board, Resi-
-dent Student Association and the
School of General Studies for
distribution throughout campus.

“The booklet is not difficult to
read and relates, in most instances,
to common sense, with simple step
reminders for people to take in
protecting themselves against
crime,” he said.

Graham said he expects the
booklet to be effective because its
numerous illustrations and the ease
with which the book can be read
make the tips easy to remember
and, therefore, easy to_apply. I

Several thousand copies or the
booklet have yet to be released,
Graham said, but will be used for
future orientation sessions and for
any student or administrative group
that should need copies.

“We meet with various campus
groups about 50 times a year to
discuss methods of crime preven-
tion ,” he said, “and this booklet
should provide information to an
awful lot more people and should
augment our meetings and personal
contact." '

The booklet was published by a
commercial agency specializing in
safety and crime prevention publi-

cations, with advice from Pitt's
campus police training ‘and plan-
ning experts,'Graham said. _

He said the booklet was originally
scheduled for release last fall but
the publisher initially shipped
10,000 copies t6 the campus police
with Pittsburgh misspelled and
“we thought it would be rather
embarrassing to release the booklet
with the name of our city spelled
wrong.”

In other police business, SGB
member Dave Hesidence said he
and a few other SGB members met
with Graham yesterday in Varsity
Hall for an orientation meeting and
a tour of the campus police
facilities. — -

“I was very impressed,” Hesi-

dence said. “They’re a very well
run and very efficient organization.
I was surprised to learn how
sophisticated their communications
and record keeping system is.”

During the meeting, Hesidence
said he questioned Graham on the
Black Action Society’s allegation
that the campus police ‘discriminate
against blacks when making
arrests. He said Graham explained
that it’s true more blacks are
arrested than whites, but that
Graham stressed Pitt is located next
to a black community and that most
arrests made by the campus police
involve non-University people;
especially juveniles.

  SGB’s Wise Decision

TheStudentGovernmentBoard’sdecisiontotakenuttualcontrolofa ’

big spring concert away from the Black Action Society and the SGB
Programming Committee andtum it into two smaller concerts produced
separately by the groups was_ a wise and positive move.

The Board recognized a deteriorating situation and acted soon enough
rto ensure that the show(s) will go on.

BAS and the Programming Committee were unable to agree on
enough points to provide direction for one concert. Rather than make
itself believe that things would be patched up by showtime, the Board
saw the handwriting on the wall and stepped in, giving both groups a
concert to program A

As one digs deeper, the apparent wisdom of this move increases. The
SGB did not infringe upon the autonomy of either group. Had the minor
disagreements been allowed to continue, the disagreement over the
concert would have grown into ill-feeling between the two groups, thus
ruling out any chance of future co-operation between them.

Students have already paid a price for the inability of the BAS and the
Programming Committee to reach an agreement. , They have lost a
big-name perforrnertotwo lesser performers. Let's hope lessons will be
learned and future losses prevented. '

Thelimmediate reaction solved the immediate problem, the possibility
of no concert. Now that time has been bought, the Board must help
these groups learn to work together, for the future of equitable student

programming.

Support The Co-Op

r Thefoodco-opisback, bigger andbetterthanever. And apparently it
is here to stay. The food selection has expanded and the quality is

superb.

 " Students almost lost this service last December; organizational

departure

The new Student Govermnent Board, to start fulﬁlling their promise
of increased student services, decided to continue the co-op. Some
organizational changes were added, in order to insure a more even
distribution of work. So far it seems to be working.

The continued success does not depend only on organization, it also
depends on students. Since this is a co-op, ideally all students should
contribute a few hours work each month to keep operation costs at a

As for the prices, the higher volume the co-op handles, the lower the
cost per person becomes. Therefore, students should not hold out
merely because the service is only slightly cheaper than what
supermarkets offer. The more students who order, the more economical
the co-op becomes.

In the long run, the co-op’s success depends on how responsive it is to
student needs. It is up to the students to tell co-op managers what they
want from it. An excellent chapce to do this is March 2, when the

steering committee for the co-op holds an open meeting to plan for the
weeks ahead. '

Northern City Alternatives

BY LEN ROMBERG

“Go south young man” would
appear to be the best advice that
could be given to an ambitious
college graduate who is looking for
greater job opportunities.

For the past 30 years, a trend has
developed which requires immed-
iate national attention and the
development of a policy to deal with
it. The trend is the downfall of the
northeastern cities against the rise
of the sunbelt.

This development is not new to
anyone, but it can not go on being
ignored as it generally has been.
During an interview last week,
Mayor Pete Flaherty talked about
this problem as it concerns
Pittsburgh. T

He said many youngand middle
income people have been leaving
the city, draining away its vital tax
base. The ﬂight to the suburbs is a
well-known development of the
post-World War II years.

Movement of the wealthier
people out of the cities, leaving low
income and welfare recipients
behind, have led to the disintegra-
tion and ﬁnancial chaos of our
commercial and cultural centers.

However, that is only half of the

problem. A population and wealth
shift from the Northeast to the

Mankind seems to have no

postulates like 1+1 equals 2 and
natural phenomenon like sunrise

acy through examinations. term

The answers are already there; we
merely retell what is already
accepted. .

NON-THINKING

People think before the fact.
hence their thinking is not original.
They do not really think about what
they read or hear. Little thought is

South and Southwest is clearly
dominant. Atlanta and Houston
boom while New York fades.
While eight of the Northeast’s
largest cities have declined from
17.5 to 15.5 million total population
since 1950, the reverse has

happened in the South. Populations -

of eight major sunbelt cities have
nearly tripled from 3 to 8.5 million in
the.same time period.

Northeast states have lost 13
electoral votes for presidential
elections while California alone has
gained 20, displaying movement of
political power.

The warm weather in the South
makes it not only a more desirable
place, but also perhaps the
necessary place to live. The recent
cold wave and energy crisis have-
made the sunbelt much more
attractive. ’ "

Besides the lower amounts .. of

‘energy and money needed for

heating, the South would appear to
be the best place to start using solar
energy. Greater abundance of land _
which is also less polluted, makes
competition with the South even
rougher for the Northeast.

These natural developments‘
leave behind critical questions to be
answered. Should the .north-to-
south flow be left . unchecked,

lead to initial. weak belief systems
that expand into belief patterns
that become future frames of
reference. Problem solving be-

This pattern blinds future new
thinking because the values are
set. providing little chance of
testing or evaluation.

Therefore he got a poor grade

further by adding more fantasy and

Co-Op Problems
Explained

While ordering from the newly
re-opened food co-op on Tuesday,
February 22, 1977. I heard a woman
complaining that the prices were
“no bargain." As far as I know the
co-op does not promise a “bargain”
to the buyers. It does promise
better quality food at prices lower
than supermarket prices. As far as
my experience goes, I know the
quality of the food is far superior to
supermarket produce, but two
things must be kept in mind when
purchasing from the co-op.

First of all the co-op cannot buy in
the volume that supermarkets buy

Ticket Report
Racist Attack

The article written in the Pitt
News revealing Yusef Ali as a ﬁrst
degree violator of this city’s parking
statutes is a glaring example of the
racist policy that serves as a corner
stone for administrative reasoning.
This was nothing but a sniper's
attempt to assassinate his charac-
ter. It also helps to reaffirm what
most minority and politically aware
students have known all along; that
is, given the opportunity. the
University will exploit the smallest

- incident as an attempt to discredit

an individual.

It is well known that the
administration has been part and
parcel to attempts in the past to
keep unfavorable publicity from

» those beneath its station. Evident-

ly, for some reason (racism) the
code doesn’t apply in Ali’s case.
The mere fact that the article was
considered newsworthy will never
fail to amuse me; the fact being that
it isn't. What is worthy of some
exposure is the discrimination that

permeates the University of Pitts-
burgh from top to bottom.

All Not Happy
In Tower B

This letter is in reference to the
impersonal and inconsiderate treat-
ment of the residents of the 14th
floor of Tower B.

We recently found out (via the
grapevine) that we are being forced
to move to a different floor or
perhaps a different residence hall.
We imagine that the housing
autlrority feels it can justify this
change. but since it was never
explained to us we cannot possibly
see this change as valid.

lf out of a possible 34 returning
girls. 22 wish to remain together on

our floor. why can't they just stay? ,

Shouldn't they have at least had
some consideration for returning

‘students?

We understand that in a place as

_large as the University of Pitts-

burgh the administration cannot
have personal contact with each_
student. but isn‘t it just common
courtesy to inform us properly of

this decision before we marked our
room preferences. which nowhave
no meaning.

lhosc in charge have given us

nothing but a runaround and we"

feel that 22 students deserve some
kind of consideration. If this
decision was made for a valid
reason. the least they (housing

autliority) could have done was‘

have the courage to face us and not
inform us in a memo.

A&P & Giant Eagle:
They All Look Alike

BY DAVE McDONALD

If you live in the Oakland area,
particularly south Oakland or the
dormitory area. you have two
choices when deciding where to do
your grocery shopping—A&P and
Giant Eagle.

.For some students. the weekly or
semi-monthly shopping trip can
take a largebite out of their pay or
allowance. so it is only practical to
shop where you can get the best
deals and the lowest prices.

Grocery shopping in Oakland
presents two problems: first, there
is usually no best deal and
second. there are no low prices.

Some Oakland shoppers may say
Giant Eagle prices are the lowest,
while others insist that A&P’s can't
be beat. Some shoppers are
indifferent and believe there is no
difference between the prices of

the two stores. If you're one of
those who say there is no difference
you're most likely right.

A comparison of the two stores
shows there is very little difference
in price. especially in name brand
products. It seems A&P and Giant
Eagle ‘stick pretty close to
suggested retail prices for name
brands, so they don't offer many
bargains.

For 32 name brand products
surveyed. there was only a
difference of 50 cents between the
two stores. This small difference
was realized mainly because A&P
had a 10-ounce jar of Maxwell

House coffee for $4.49 and Giant '

Eagle’s~price for the same product
was $4.99. For the 32 name
brands. A&P came out with the
lowest prices by 50 cents.

An important point to remember

Being a professional music-

ian is an insecure business,” says
Iou Schreiber. edging into his chair
and moving his cane out ofthe way.
“It's only as secure as you are."
Schreiber, 29. is blind—he has
been since birth—and he's a
professional "musician who plays
the piano, organ, clarinet and the

tenor. alto and soprano. saxa-I

phones. He also tunes pianos for

the Pittsburgh Blind Association on

Craig Street in Oakland.
“Music's an up and down thing,

man." Schreiber says. “When the
owner of a club is dissatisfied with
you. or simply wants a change.
you're out. It just depends on the
mood of the club. You have to be
willing to accept that if you want to
play, man.”

Schreiber started learning music
at the age of three and started
tuning pianos during the eighth
grade at the Pittsburgh School for
Blind Children in Oakland. Today.
he averages about six engagements

a week and tunes pianos when he
can.

“Music's my hobby, man,”.he

says. “I'd really rather tune pianos
for a living, but I can make more
money playing. I gotta eat. man.”
When he's playing regularly,
Schreiber doesn't schedule too
many tuning appointments. He
says doing both in one day is too
much. '
Shifting his body in his chair and
placing his cane between his legs to
get comfortable, Schreiber says,
“There's an old adage ﬂoating
around that blind people tune
pianos better than sighted people.
That's not true. Bill Conley, my old
piano teacher who has several
tuning contracts in and around the
city and who is sighted, is as ﬁne as

any tuner anywhere in the
.country."
. Schreiber is now Conley’s

assistant and the two of them..with
one other assistant. tune pianos for

the Pittsburgh Symphony. Pitts-I

burgh School for Blind Children,
Carnegie-Mellon University and
Pitt. as well as many other clients.
Schreiber does not play steadily.
with any particular band. He's a
free-lance musician of sorts who
plays only when called upon. He
admits he's a better piano player
than clarinet or sax player, but
that's only because he's been
playing the piano longer.than the
others and because, as he says, “I
get more practice at it since bands
usually want a pianist before they
want anything else." _ '
His first professional engage-
ment was in a musical back-up
group for a church play in his
hometown, Bellevue..when he was
15. Since then he has played with
such notables as Maynard Fergu-

son, George Benson, Walt Harper, ’

Hurricane Smith and, classmate

' Eric Kloss. 

In fact. Kloss'h'”as-been a major
influence in Schreiber-'s career-

together (Eric's father is the head
of the Blind School) and when they
were in the sixth grade Schreiber
was ready to call it quits with
music. But Kloss persuaded him to
stick it out and for that Schreiber
has remained forever grateful.
Schreiber went on to be. as one of
his‘ school awards read. the best
player of. popular music in the
school.

Although Schreiber still enjoys
popular music. his favorite music is
jazz. especially the kind that begins

t e same and the quality compar-
able. For the name brands“ the’
total cost was $8.92;
brands‘ cost. was only $7.59.

A&P’s store brands are mostly
under the Ann Page label and

Giant Eagle's house variety is Food .

Club.

As for comparing the stores‘ - A

prices. there wasn't much differ-
ence. A&P came out on top for the,
least expensive prices. but it
wasn't by much. In the 48 grocery
products surveyed, A&P'S total
prices were 78 cents lower than
Giant Eagle's. The total tally for
the two stores for the 48 goods was
A&P. $40.60 and Giant Eagle.
$41.38. . I I

and ends with a melody. "I don't
especially enjoy free-form jazz, the
kind of stuff Miles Davis and his
followers play. because it gets
boring after awhile. It has very
little meaning." he says.

His favorite musicians are
Cannonball Adderly. Art Tatum,
Eddie Daniels and Hubert Laws.
“Coltrane and his followers are just
too .far out for me, man," he says.

“But, we can't like it all,” he
says lifting himself out of the chair

Manilow:

BY KATE McCALL

Barry Manilow has found the
magic at last.

He performed Wednesday night,
with his female back-up group Lady
Flash and his band The City
Rhythm, to a standing room only
crowd at Pittsburgh's Heinz Hall.

Performing at the home of Andre
Previn and one of the world's best
symphony orchestras is a far cry
from the small-scale club singing
Manilow and his group were doing
three years ago at the Bijou Club in

Philadelphia, and similar places in
Boston and New York.

Manilow and his entourage are ‘a
group in the strictest sense; his
performance depends in many ways
upon theirs. He takes care to give
them attention during each show.
spotlighting their solos and letting
them have the stage to themselves
occasionally. He did this years ago
in Philadelphia and again Wednes-
day night in Heinz Hall. Through
this long association, Manilow and
company have become a tighter.
slicker performing group.

Giving Rising Stars

A Necessary Push

BY PAMELA EUSI

Selling art. via the publicity
release. must be a nasty profes-
sion. However, judging from the
deluge of promotional material that
travels through the mail system. it

must be a proﬁtable profession

also.

The idea of the publicity release
is this: take an artist (any artist)
who is unknown and turn him into a
budding superstar. Simple. huh?

Let's look. for an example. at a
recent release sent out about a
“rising.star" from a fairly new
record sub-company. She Is Sold

Old, New Tricks from Queen, Cold and

BY M. PATRICK MONAHAN

A Day At the Races
Queen
Elecktra-6E-101 '

With “A Day at the Races,”
Queen has fallen victim to that
age-old show business syndrome of
milking a successful format for all
it's worth. ‘

Last year's artistic and commer-
cial triumph, “A Night at the
Opera,” was the superbly polished
album that put Queen into rock’s
big leagues by effectively combin-
ing operatic vocals with hard rock
music.

“A Day at the Races” does the
same, but is so similar in all
phases—song content, vocal over-
dubs, melody, instrumentation and
album packaging-—that it emerges
merely as a carbon copy of ‘ ‘A Night
at the Opera.”

Never let it be said that all artists
change direction and style with each
album and subsequent tour, but

great musicians at least try to come L

up with work that differs somewhat
from past achievements.

“A Day at the Races’ ’ is good. but
Queen is too talented and musically
sophisticated to be taking this easy
way out so early in its career.

From a technical and production-
al aspect, the album maintains the
high quality for which Queen has
always been known. However,
seven of the 10 songs suffer from

The dark and suave Mercury
fancies himself to be a continental,
tongue-in-cheek, romantic crooner.

On “A Night at the Opera’ ’ he wrote:
a series of love ballads ﬁlled with
operatic and over-dubbed vocals
layered over drippy piano melodies.

The style worked because it was
somewhat different from what other
artists had achieved up until that
point. The similar songs on “A Day

at the Races"——“You Take My
Breath Away." “The Millionaire
Waltz,” “Somebody To Love” and

   

“Good Old-Fashioned Lover Boy”
—are cute, but rather banal and
cliche coming . from a man
considered to be one of the finest
songwriters to emerge fronl rock’s
new breed.

The Mercury treatment is also
given to bassist John Deacon's
“You and I” and guitarist Brian
May's “Teo Torriatte (Let Us Cling
Together),” both acceptable tunes,
but hardly memorable. ‘

Magic and Miracles

Manilow can take an audience on
a musical adventure, replete with
highs and lows. His act is precise.
It has—and this impresses Pitts-
burgh audiences—class.

Wednesday’s performance be-
gan, as always, with Lady Flash
(Debra Byrd, Reparata and Monica
Burruss) approaching the audience.

Wearing long ﬂowing capes, they
introduced the star with a sing-song
rhythm: “ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Barry Manilow.”

Manilow talked to the audience,
then slipped into “Why Don’t We
Live Together,” meanwhile pulling
off the capes from Lady Flash. As if
on cue, young girls from the
audience ran down the aisle,
offering Manilow roses and draw-
ings.

Switching tempos, Manilow

dropped into the slow moving
“Weekend in New England” and
switched again for an upbeat
medley of 40’s and SO’s hits,
including two of his scat numbers:
“Cloudburst” and “Avenue C.”
For his rendition of the American
Bandstand he jitterbugged with
Reparata. The band graciously
nominated them the number-one
couple on the dancing ﬂoor.

For the second half of the show,
Manilow was more intlvimiate,
appearing alope, at first, to
reminisce about the playing-in-the-
piano-bar-days. He sat at a small
piano with a tacky palm tree beside
him, singing “One of These Days.”

Still alone, and leaving nostalgia
behind, he sang some of his

Peter Gabriel
Peter Gabriel
Atco SD 36-147

Peter Gabriel's recurrent vis-
ion of the Apocalypse, up to now
expressed in his work with Genesis,
was as pretentious as it was
majestic. This shortcoming arose in
part from the obligation felt by the
members of the group to continue
the image their audience (and they

too) had come to expect from them. '

While this attitude is conducive to
popularity, it impedes artistic
progress. .Such is the case with
Gabriel, who, in 1975, left the
confines of Genesis to develop, more

‘personally viable expressions.

“Peter Gabriel” is his ﬁrst public
statement of that refusal to
compromise. For this reason, if
none other, it is an interesting
album for those concerned with the
state of the art.

On first hearing, one acquainted
with Genesis cannot help making
comparisons, especially instru-

mentally. But, ultimately, this is an’

album that begs, or rather,
demands, to be viewed solely on its
own terms.

Those terms are not always easy
or comfortable. One must work,
intellectually and emotionally,
through Gabriel's lyrics and music.
Both demand discretion; no clear-

cut distinctions of form can be made '

when listening_to his‘ work;

lesser-known pieces: famous

commercial jingles that he had once '

worked on.

The band slipped into position
while Manilow was singing “Man-
dy” and they helped" bring it to a
grand ﬁnish. He left the stage, a
city skyline backdrop fell. Lady
Flash began “Street Singing”and
then “No Where to Run.” The
ﬁnale was on its way.

“Could It Be Magic?” (yes, it
Ct uld), sung before a_ slowly
descending backdrop (taken from
the cover of his “Trying to Get the

beginning of‘ the end of the show.

Ugliness is presented in the guise
of beauty and vice-versa; serious-
ness is mixed with irony; musical
phrases transform now subtly, now
blatantly from one style to another;
nothing is as it seems. What begins
as a fairly direct rock song
convolutes into something more
tenuous, more symbolic.

The danger in this is that those
listeners who expect an obviously
stable presentation of their kind of
music could be put off by such a
ﬂux. In other words, it makes for

good art—not good sales. It is
doubtful that this is a record made
to sell, producer Bob Ezrin
notwithstanding. Granted, the
songs “Modern Love,” “Slow-
burn” and “Down the Dolce Vita”
utilize an accessible hard rock
framework (and most resemble
Ezrin’s past production techniques)
but even of these, the latter two
drastically change form midway
through.
Such songs as “Excuse Me” and
‘ ‘Moribund the Burgermeister’ ’ are
more avant-garde and thus more
difﬁcult to tag stylistically. One
expects single-minded listeners to
skip over these cuts before they’re
understood or appreciated. Then
there is, of course, Peter Gabriel's
vocalizing, which can be quite
dramatic and as easily'misunder-
stood. An appreciation of the
theatrically effusive quality of his
voice must be acqu_ired,'but, as with
any challenging artwork, it is worth

well. Then hepaused. “I’ve been
dying to say this all week, ’ ’ _he said.

He turned and V dropped . the

microphone, saying, “Shitl Ireally i

wanted to win.” ~ _

If he had won, it wouldn’t have
been a miracle, or even magic for
that matter. Manilow and his group
have magic and miracles, but they
give them to their audience—freely

Turning Out Rocking ’Go|d’

{Continued from‘ Page 10)
“Hope You Feel Good" is
amazingly similar to Liverpool's
best circa 1966. A catchy melody.
tight harmony on the refrain and a
strong lead guitar make this cut a

sure hit with rockers who think‘

Lennon and McCartney evolved too
quickly.

On the softer side is “Firefly:"

simple, melancholic lyrics,'lone-
some cello and a vocal as mellow as
McCartney's. if ever there was
one. .
Light contemporary rock is
Gold's specialty though. In the
Steely Dan vein, "Go Back Home
Again" and “Lonely Boy" are
tough and strong in all depart-
ments. From cymbals to bass.
Gold glistens and even throws in
some reggae on “Lonely Boy."

Speaking of things Jamaican.
Gold and Ronstadt take on “Stay,"
that Latin oldie from way back.
Although not one of the record's
better cuts,‘ Gold doesn’t skimp on
arrangement. packing the track full
of Latin percussion and sleek guitar
riffs. .

Also in the oldie department is
“Do Wah Diddy." by now 14 years‘
dusty. This one comes off better
than “Stay" because of the electric
throb the band runs through it._
Opening with some tight guitar
work. Gold chugs the rest of the
way on sheer rhythm, mimicking
Manfred Mann's original version in
the vocals.

The only time Gold gets bogged
down is on a couple of deadbeat
ballads. “Learning the Game" and
“Passing Thing" pale in the face of
the glittering rock arrangements.

(Continued from Page 10)

The vocals on “Drowse” are
supplied by drummer Roger Taylor
and reinforce, unfortunately, the
stereotypical idea that drummers
can’t sing.

May turns in the most commend-
able job on “A Day at the Races.”
“Tie Your Mother Down” is a hot,
straight ahead rocker that packs an
audio wallop. “White Man” is a
gripping and majestic heavy metal
mood piece ﬁred by his crisp and
distinct guitar passages. “Long
Away” has May turning in a fine
vocal effort that is soothing after
listening to Mercury trying to
conjure up images of Rudy Vallee on
so many songs.

“A Day at the Races” suffers
from too much Freddie Mercury.
not enough Brian May guitar work
and a shortage of fresh ideas.

And Gold’s voice. although sooth-
ing, has a tendency to venture into
a monotone when not shaken by
strong rhythm.

A pleasant ballad. however, is
“One of Them is Me." There's a
bit of a beat and some backup
vocals to keep Gold stepping. The

band blares to a climax and Botts'
percussion sparkles, making it all
worthwhile.

lf Gold wanted to pluck a hit
Single from this album. ﬂipping a
coin would be as beneficial as any
other method—his efforts are that
good. ~

What ‘isn't so light is still

enjoyable. HaIfof“l-Iumdrum" is a
catchy. surrealistic tango. “Sols-

bury Hill," playful British folk,
feels refreshing. In “Moribund,"
Gabriel undercuts the mordant
melodrama of plague songs by
treating the subject so slyly. A
thoroughly ﬁne melody; like the
other cuts, it surprises. One keeps
finding a purposefulness that
develops through repeated listen-
ings.

Rice-less Hoopsters St

BY RON SIEGEL

.PHILADELPHIA--Michael
Rice isn't nicknamed “the fran-
chise,”.but he is an indispensable
part of the Pitt basketball team. The
absence of the 6-8 freshman was
painfully obvious Wednesday night
as Temple handed Pitt its worst
defeat of the season, a 78-48
drubbing. A

Rice had been playing with an
injured thigh muscle on his right leg
for about three weeks. It ﬁnally
caught up with him during
Monday's game at Indiana (Pa.),
where he was forced to sit out the
second half.

An examination by physicians
revealed that Rice has a calcium
deposit on his thigh muscle and will
be out for the rest of what will surely
be a short season for the Panthers.

Pitt’s play last night made it clear
that any more victories this season

will be classiﬁed as miracles. With:

Rice and Kelvin Smith out with
injuries, the Panthers have only two
real big men—Larry Harris and Ed
Scheuermann. Scheuermann
doesn't, play anywhere near 40
minutes, so the Panther lineup
often features four guards.

The Pitt wrestling team proved to
be the healthier of two patients
Wednesday night, crippling the
West Virginia Mountaineers, 33-15,
at the Fitzgerald Field House.

Actually, the season ﬁnale should
have been held at a hospital—that's
how injured both teams were.

“They're in the same situation
we’re in," Panther coach Dave
Adams noted. p“Everyone’s beaten
up physically. West Virginia had a
good team—maybe the best they've
had in a long time—at the

beginning of the season.”
And so did Pitt—until injuries
decimated a 5-0 team to a 5-6 squad.
Things got so‘ bad, Adams had to
cancel tomorrow's home match with
ﬁfth-ranked Michigan.
..“I talked with the Michigan

points. The only problem was that
Temple’s stingy zone defense is the
13th-best in the country.

“We knew that Harris could hurt
us,” said Owl coach Don Casey.
“He can really stick it. We just
leaned our defense towards him.”

That simple move worked
brilliantly. Harris didn’t get many
shots after those ﬁrst 10 points and
the Panthers didn’t seem to know
what to do with the ball. What they
usually ended up doing was turning
it over—30 times.

During the decisive part of the
game when Temple scored 15
unanswered points to take a 27-12

 

~ Panthers Wayne Williams 'left] and Larry1Harrts- [right] are both »

lead, three of the Owl ﬁeld goals
came on easy lay-ups resulting from
Pitt’s coughing up the ball.

_ With five minutes left in the ﬁrst
half, it was all over except for the
ﬁnal score.

“We just lost our patience,” said
Pitt head coach Tim Grgurich after
the game. “We know how to play
against Temple. We went against
their zone last year (and won). We
felt that our guys would respond
better to the loss of Michael (Rice).
They did for the ﬁrst l0 minutes,
but then we got a littel tired. It was
our third game in ﬁve nights.".
With the game out of hand by

    
   

ﬁghting to provide the ﬁnal roll of the basketball through the hoop.
Harris hit for a game high 24 points against Temple Wednesday .night.

         Grapplers Sickeni-

coach,” Adams explained, ‘ ‘and we
decided it was best they didn't come
in here since we’d probably have to
forfeit a couple of weight classes.”

Which is exactly what West
Virginia had to do. The
Mountaineers backed out of the
118- and 126-bouts, handing Pitt an
early 12-0 lead—something the
Panthers haven't seen all season.

After Pitt’s Steve Carter injected
John Hastie with a 6-2 drawback at
134, giving the Panthers a 15-0
cushion, a relapse occured.
Mountaineer matmen pinned Kim
Smith and Kevin McNamara at 142
and 150, respectively, closing the
incision to 15-l2.

After Jim Gordon punctured
Tony Melonas at 150," 6-3, giving
Pitt breathing room with an 18-12
lead, Skip Bolin, Don Arndt and Bill

Bailey brought Pitt back to life.

Bolin, despite an injury which
limited his movement, had an easy
time with Tony Miller, winning by a
fall at 167 with only one minute left
in the bout and preserving his
undefeated season.

Arndt, although “only 60 percent
healthy”
nursed a 7-4 victory from Cliff

 

v Boone at 177 to push the Panthers

further ahead, 27-12.

Bailey, bandaged left arm and all,
put the win into formaldehyde with
a quick pinning of Allen Eldridge

only 1:11‘ into the match» for an A

insurmountable 33-12 margin.
In the ﬁnal bout of the day,
Mark Durham downed Pitt surprise

_ starter Milt Schuler, 7-4, in the

heavyweight match. Which is a
close score, considering Schuler
_ wasn’_t on the team roster two‘ days

' 'bef6i'e‘the match‘ and_1..wta:s called iifto

emergency action ' after regular
Mark Stepanovich couldn't perform
due to a back injury.
“Milt practiced only one night,”
Adams explained. “He just came
out last night. He used to be on the
‘team last year, but this year offered
to work with Stepanovich at
practices. I think he showed a lot of
intestinal fortitude.”

Although the victory evened the
Panthers’ record to 6-6 (West
Virginia fell to 3-16) and gave them
a little confidence for the Eastern
Wrestling League tournament
March 5-6 at Lock Haven, Adams

wasn't'totally pleased with their

operation.’ .
‘_‘It’_sﬁnot -,_,the case of being
satisfied with the score," he stated.
“but a case .of trying’ to get the guys
to do what you want. We need a lot
of work in getting out from
underneath.”
I And a lot of patience. 

  

halftime, Pitt began doing every-
thing as if it were very tired. The
Panthers shot just 28 percent from
the floor in the second half, 33
percent for the game. Harris was
the lone bright spot.

The 6-6 forward responded well
to the increased burden put on him,
scoring 24 points and hauling in 14
rebounds, tops for the game in both
categories.

The second half was an exercise
infutility. Pitt continued to commit
turnovers and Temple’s leading
scorer was a little-used guard who
scored most of his 18 points on easy
breakaways.

sewn’ Around
Cagers Number One,
But at Pitt-Bradford

BY STEVE SYBERT

 

. The Pittbasketball team is number .one. Yes, number one, but at... . ..  

the Bradford branch campus.

In a season that saw the main campus Panthers fall flat on their
snouts, a reasonable summation looking at their dismal 5-20 record‘, the
Pitt-Bradford (UPB)_ contingent has been ranked number one in Region
III of the National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA) in the
final ballot taken last Sunday.

Rounding out their regular season tonight against Genessee
Community College, the UPB Panthers are currently 17-4 and are
preparing to take their top raiiking to the NJ CAA Region III playoffs in
Corning, N.Y. March 3-5. UPB is the only Pennsylvania school among
the 30 competing in Region III.

“They look really good, really good,” commented Bradford Era
sports writer Ken Himes on the UPB Panthers. ‘ ‘Ifthey win three games
in the playoffs, they go to Hutchinson, Kansas, for the NJ CAA national
championship. They have a really good shot at it."

According to Himes, UPB is not known for its basketball excellence,
but second-year coach Dick Danielson has apparently turned the
program around, sending the Panthers to the Region III tourney for the
second yeaf in a row. Last season, UPB finished with an 18-6 record and
a number-three ranking.

Included in the floor sport turnaround at UPB has been the
construction of a $1.1 million sports complex which houses the main
gymnasium, two auxiliary gyms, offices, training and locker rooms, and

seats for 1,500 persons. Having beaten previously number-one ranked ‘A

Jamestown (N .Y.) Community College, 73-67, on February 9, UPB
celebrated the opening of the complex three days later by nipping
.nuiiiber two Niagara Community College, 76-74, to lay claim to the top
spot.

UPB’s victory over Jamestown, the top Region III team for the past
several seasons, ended the Jayhawks’ 67-game home win streak and
also their 16-game win streak of this season. A week later, at home, the
Panthers hammered Jamestown again, 93-81, to raise their record to
15-2 and provoke Danielson to attest, “We've beaten the number—one ‘
ranked team twice now and I think that makes us number one."

In five meetings with the top three -teams of Region III, UPB captured‘

four of the games. Two victories within a week over a top~ranked team is .1: .. 1:  5'

a rare feat in any sport. .

Despite splitting their next four games (including a 99-45 thrashing at    
the hands of Niagara without big men Jim ‘ ‘Pee Wee” Bolden and'Doug  ‘j

Lloyd), Danielson’s claim proved correct last Sunday.

Besides Bolden (whoseta UPB record February 14 versus Niagara, i  _
with 23 rebounds) and Lloyd, .the Panthers are _ led by “slick  V ,
ball-handler" Jeff Qu__inn,v “automatic shooting" Eric James, Rick ":5. 1 v "
Tarpley and Bill Miller. James poured in ‘32 points to lead UPB in the 'g-.}_.“

In addition to UPB’s success, another branch campus, Pitt-Johnstown   if
(UPJ), is also headed forapost-season competition. UPJ, which lost  ,
95-90, Tuesday night to Edinboro to fall -to a 13-5 record, was seeded,  '

For   Day-ton Ohio lee

BY JIM PANE

' The Pitt Hockey Club takes its
road show to Ohio tomorrow for a 4
p.m. faceoffiagainst Dayton Univer-
sity.

In what will be their sixth
consecutive road game, the Pan-
thers, who have long since
guaranteed themselves another
winning season, will strive to
improve their ll-3-1 record while
Dayton (6-7-l) hopes to reach the

' .500 mark.

Although Pitt boasts the superior
record, Dayton coach Walt Deanna
claims that his team will give the
Panthers a run for their money.

“From what I've heard it should
be a pretty even game,” Deanna
said. ‘‘I talked with the Ohio U.
coach after we beat them 9-5, and he
told me a little bit about the Pitt

. team."

Despite owning a losing record
and dressing players who may be
too small to compete against the
harder-hitting teams like Pitt.

Dayton enters the game with a‘

well-balanced offensive attack.
Only one or two points separate
each scorer on the team's top-ten
list, and the three top scorers on the
squad all skate on different lines.

But head coach Len Barcalow's
Panthers have a scoring machine of
their own. Eight names on the Pitt
roster have a double-ﬁgure scoring
total next to them and three
Panthers have scored 40 or more
points.

Pitt’ .is led by sophomore
sensation Curt Hetz, who has
scored a team high 26 goals to go
along with 29 assists for a 15-game
total of 45 points. -

Hetz’s line, which includes Gary
Fries and Jeff Saunders or Dave

Elson, must, however, make way
for the line of Tom Sherwin, Bill
Gedeon and Tim Duffy who have
amassed a whopping 106 points
among them.

Pitt's success has come from the
ability of curtain players to fill
vacant positions in the lineup.
Barcalow pointed to Saunders and
Elson as notable examples.

“We can use Jeffon the back line
or on another forward line, " the Pitt
coach said, “and we're not hurting
with Elson filling in on Hetz’s line,
we're just fortunate that certain
guys can handle these situations.
It's worked out tremendously.”

PANTHER PUCKS: Don't let
Dayton’s 9-5 victory over Ohio
University fool you. Several Bobcat
players, including player-coach

Sauer drove in for the bucket.
Edinboro scored several quick
baskets, but Pitt retaliated, keeping
a four-point lead until Scot forward
Audrey Scott hit a jumper. Scott
was fouled by Pantherette Kit
Loeffler and hit both free throws to
tie the game at 24 all. Edinboro
pulled ahead with two fast baskets,
then started a scoring rampage
good f<;r six unanswered baskets
and a 46-37 halftime margin.

Sauer, who opened up the third
quarter scoring, led Edinboro to a
13-point lead, but Pitt
Wanda Randolph hit on three
straight baskets to put the
Pantherettes back in the game. Pitt
rallied when forward Joan Maser
led the pack for an uncontested
lay-up and guard Kathy Paczkowski
stole a pass from the Scots, ﬂipping
it to forward Barb Welsh for an easy
two points. Loeffler connected on a
free throw to narrow the gap to a
single basket.

Scot guard Sheila Collins‘retali-

center _

ated and the game became a
shoot-out between Collins and
Randolph until Pitt fouled Scot
center Kate Kosewicz and Edinboro
pulled ahead to a 70-64 edge on the
converted free throws.

Pitt put forth one of its best
performances of the season in the
fourth quarter. Randolph paced the
Pantherettes to score six of 12
unanswered points to push Pitt
ahead permanently. At one time,
the Pantherettes led by as many as
six points. Edinboro cut the
difference to three and edged within
a single point, but the Pantherettes
charged back for the ﬁnal score of
87-84.

Randolph led all scorers with 27
points, 20 of which were scored in
the second half. Senkowski added
24 and Welsh chipped in 14. ‘Sauer
paced Edinboro with 20 points,
Barb Moran tallied 18, Kosewicz
scored 16, Scott tipped in 14 and

, Collins had 10.

Randolph blocked 10 shots and

etoff Scot-Free. 87-84

hauled in 23 rebounds. Paczkowski

had seven assists and Senkowski

added six. .

“I was surprised we didn't put it
away sooner." said Pitt coach Pat
Wallace.

“I'm glad we won———we needed V

this for regionals.

“We kept going down and
coming back, Wallace continued.
“The half court press really turned
it around for us in the second half. It
was an all-out team effort, they did
what they were supposed to.”

“We haven’t-lost yet at home,”
Senkowski said. “We had a couple
of breakdowns, but overall, we were
pretty consistent.’ ’

“Ithought Pitt played a lot better
than the last time,” commented
Scot coach Judy Sauer. “Wanda
Randolph is a nice player—there’s
no doubt about it.”

The Pantherettes, now 17-6, will
host Lock Haven 4 p.m. tomorrow at
the Field House in Pitt’s ﬁnal home
contest of the season.

And it's no different for Pitt skaters
Gary Fries and linemate Curt Hetz
when the burly Fries leaps over the
boards.

“People beat on Curt and I can't
let people do that." said the 6-0.
175 lb. Fries snidely. "I like to hit
people. I really do. It's part of the

game and it's to my advantage to
use my size."

En route to racking up over 70
penalty minutes in 14 games this
season (he led the team last season
with 42 minutes .in 15, games),
Fries. a junior left ..winger, has
proven himself as an all-around
hockey player despite what his
aggressiveness might imply. So far
in 1976-77. he has tallied five goals
(four in‘ one game versus Du-
quesne, January 26) and 15 assists
for a respectable 20 points. ’

“With Curt, he really gets out in
front ofthe play a lot. so I headman
the puck to him," the 23-year-old
Fries said ofhis game play. “I just
as much like to seeone of my
passes set up a goal than see me
put it in. I don't have an
exceptional shot, but I'm hard to
move from out in front of the net."

A 1971 graduate of Plum High
School. Fries, who" took up hockey
only five years ago, left the
Pittsburgh area to -attend’ the
University of Utah on a swimming
scholarship and also participated in
water polo. While'out west. he also

scorer in the Senior Division of the

“I really enjoy hockey because I
get to travel around a little," he
said. “but it (the Pitt Hockey Club)
is probably the best amateur team
around the Pittsburgh area and this
part of the state."

‘Fries returned to Pittsburgh to
continue his studies in mechanical
engineering and to marry his wife
of three and a half years, Holly, a
petite blonde who's present at

.. "every one" 'of his games, home

/and away.

“At first she was a little shaky,
but now she's getting used to it,"
Fries said of how his wife takes to
the rugged game and the numerous
injuries. Last year. Fries suffered
bruised ribs and a mild concussion
at a brutal game‘ in Cincinnati
("Holly was a little shook up about
that too. but she got over it." he
said.) Fries reinjured his ribs in a

game against Princeton three .

weeks/, ago in Philadelphia.
Still. like most hockey players,

injuries can't keep him away. Last '

season Fries was fifth on the

Panther squad in scoring (8-15-23), '

but was third in assists. Most of
his.l5 assists this season have gone
to Hetz. the sophomore leading
scorer (26-15-41).

“He's” big. which gives him the \

advantage to get into -the corners
and dig the puck out," said ‘Hetz.

goals. "That was the first game we
clicked (their other linemate for
much of the season has been Dave
'Elson)." Hetz said. "The roles
‘were just reversed. l assisted on all
his goals."

It is that kind of unity between V.

the lin'es'that has enabled Pitt to
roll up an excellent ll-3-l record
with three games remaining.

"Last year. we had a little team
dissension." Fries said. "but this
year. the team -is really tight and
we've stuck together.“

preparing for Daytona," Fryer
explained.

Both Lesniak and Figursk_i
stated they would love to race for a
living. “I’ve been interested in
racing for a long time, ever since my
brother got me started by taking me
to races." Figurski said.

“I went to races during the
summer months at Pocono and
Indianapolis,” Lesniak added,
“and I just liked it and got
interested in racing.”

Much of the time preparing the
car for the race at Daytona was
spent at a shopping center parking
lot near the club’s Bridgeviile
garage. “Early Sunday mornings,
we block off half of the parking lot,
test out the car and find out some of
the difﬁculties with it.”

It’s a time-consuming job, but
one that must be done—Daytona is
the most dangerous and frightening
track in the country, according to
Fryer. “It’s high banked curves
make you feel like you're never
going to make it around,” he‘ said.

To be a member of the Auto
Racing Club a student must work 16
hours, per week either in the race
.shop or the office, located in room
316 of the Student Union. The club
currently includes 35 students, but
because of a lack of funds, only the
three who put in the most hours can
attend the races. Fryer expressed
deep concern over that fact.

“There are no funds for everyone
to go to the races,” he said. “We’d
like to take the 12 to 15 students who
put in the most hours and also other
Pitt students who would like to go,

but we have no funds for
transportation.
‘ ‘The room and board isn’t

expensive—it’s the transportation
that is costly. It’s a funny situation.
We’re the first college auto racing
team, so the University doesn't
know what to do with us. The

atheltic department won’t give us,

funds because auto racing is not an
NCAA sport.

“The Public Relations Depart-
ment should be giving us money,
because we're good for Pitt public
relations,” Fryer insisted. “At
Daytona, we were heavily publi-
cized in area newspapers and local
television. The Student Govern-
ment should also be helping us out
because we provide entertainment
for the student body on weekends. ’ ’

March brings spring to Pitt
students and the Sebring (Fla.)
12-hour endurance race to the Pitt

Auto Racing Club. Maybe March’

will bring the race to Pitt students
also.

“People don’t get the opportun-
ity. to see auto racing,” Fryer
claimed. “We should get people to
the races and get them involved in it
instead of standing behind a
fence.”

NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J.
(AP)—James Bailey poured in 25
points, nine straight mid-way
through the second half, leading

ECBL eastern division crown with
their 7-1 league record. The

Led by Bailey, the Scarlet’
Knights raced to a 42-31 half-time
lead and extended their margin to
16 points in the.second half.

But Villanova, paced by brothers
Keith and Larry Herron, who had 22
pointsapiece, shot a blistering 60
per cent after intermission and
pulled to a 61-61 tie.

Bailey, who also had 012
rebounds, responded with his nine
straight points. The, Knights
protected a lead down the stretch.
