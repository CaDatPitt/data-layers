"The bad guy"

Agriculture vs. Culture

So what if the Nittany Lions are ranked
second in the nation behind Miami.

Pitt almost beat Miami. Well, it was close at
halftime. If they wouldn't have run that punt

back for a touchdown.
Think of it this way.

If Pitt loses tomorrow, so what? They've done
that four times this year. But if Penn State

loses...
Ha!

Pitt wins. They lose. Win. Win. Win.

Can't you just hear Jim Lampley saying,
”Well Penn State's hopes for a multi—million-
dollar championship showdown against

Miami were crushed by Mike Gottfried’s
Pitt Panthers earlier today...”

Ha!

If Pitt loses. Big deal.

Pitt's uniforms will still look better.

Reagan defends

WASHINGTON — President

, Reagan defended his policy of

selling small amounts of arms to
Iran Wednesday night and prom-
ised to provide full information to
Congress about his decision to
sell the arms.

Leading Congressional mem-
bers from both parties blasted the

president Thursday morning, say— .

ing they were not satisfied with
his defense of the secret dealings.

”I had hoped he would be able
to restore credibility Wednesday
night, but I counted at least seven
major contradictions," said Sena-
tor Sam Nunn, D-Ga., who is in
line to become chairman of the
Senate Armed Services Com-
mittee.

Nunn and Senator Richard Lu-
gar, R-Ind., the outgoing chair-
man of the Senate Foreign Rela-
tions Committee, said Reagan's
biggest contradiction was saying
that the United States had «not
condoned the transfer of arms to

 

Iran by Israel or any other
country.
”The president is in error on

that point,” said Nunn.

Then, just minutes after the
news conference had ended, the
White House released a state-
ment, signed by Reagan, saying
that in fact the United States did
involve a third country in its
secret dealings with Iran.

Meanwhile, The Los Angeles
Times said in its Thursday edi-
tions that France, Portugal, Israel
and several other European coun-
tries were all involved in the
secret dealings with Iran.

Reagan also said during the
press conference that if the deals
had remained a secret for a little
while longer, two more American

hostages would have been freed. -

In addition, Reagan touched on
his upcoming summit with Sovi-
et leader Mikhail Gorbachev, say-
ing there was no reason for any
optimism regarding that summit.

Robbery the motive
in Duffy killings

BOULDER, Mont. —— Boulder
Police investigating the murder of
the parents of Dallas star Patrick
Duffy said Thursday they suspect
robbery was the motive.

The Duffys, both in their 605,
were killed Tuesday night in The
Lounge, a tavern they had owned
for many years. Several hours af-
ter the slayings, police arrested
two 19-year-old males and
charged them with the killings.

The investigators would not

’ Health

Controversial artist attacks the new Right

By Jeff B. Thomas

Sta ff Writer

Recent efforts, by groups like
the Parents Music Resource
Center, to pass legislation that
would require ratings to be
placed on record covers have in-
spired 45-year-old rock star Frank
Zappa to speak out against cen-
sorship and condemn those who
advocate it.

His actions have included tes-
timony as a key witness in the
much-publicized Senate Com-
merce Committee hearings in
September 1985 and a six—stop

« lecture tour.

The creative and outspoken
musician spoke to some 600 peo-
ple at Carnegie Mellon Universi-
ty Tuesday night and addressed
a wide range of political and so-
cial issues.

In his lecture, Zappa disputed
PMRC claims that rock music en-
courages people to commit sui-
cide, murder and incest.

”There really is no substance to
any claims about rock ’n’ roll
making you do bad things,” Zap-
pa said. ’’If you do bad things in
the vicinity of a rock ’n’ roll
record, chances are you were
sick before you got there.”

The driving force behind the

   

rating legislation, according to
Zappa, is right-wing fundamental-
ism. He cited Jimmy Swaggart,
Jerry Falwell, Pat Robertson and
others as people who have ”built
a right-wing fundamentalist pow-
er base that is creating most of the
problems with [the] First Amend-
ment in the United States today.”

He warned the audience to’

”watch out for these guys.  The
Fundamentalist Right would love
to change America into a fascist
theocracy.”

”People are catching on,” said
Zappa. ’’It is my experience that
the average born-again Christian
is true to his faith, loves Jesus and
is a good person.  It is these
fringoid leaders that take advan-
tage of their faith and push them
in the wrong direction.”

In addition to censorship, Zap-
pa spoke about education.

’’I know you came to school for
two reasons,” Zappa said. ”One,
to get laid; two, to make money
when you get out."

Other subjects upon which
Zappa commented were:

0 Ed Meese: ”a lawless man 
[he's] one of the most dangerous
men in America — not because
he's clever, but because he's
stupid.”

0 Religion: ”l have no problem

 

with religion. If you want to have
your own personal relationship
with God, avoid the mid-
dleman.” J

0 An Orwellian Society:
”We’ve never gotten so close as
with the Reagan administration.”

0 Lawyers: ”  There are too
many lawyers in the United
States. The problem is that when
there is too many of anything, in
order for them to exist in the food
chain, they have to manufacture
things for themselves to do, and
they have to make themselves in-
dispensible to everyone on the
planet. So they have this little
trick — it's called legislation.

Racism clouding
divestment issue

Last Friday morning, signs appeared on the rest rooms of the
William Pitt Union which read, ”For Blacks Only.” On that
night and on the following evening, vandals leveled the Black
Action Society's shanty on the lawn of the William Pitt Union.
On Tuesday night, vandals spray painted the words, ”Divest
Now” on the walls of the first and fourth floor men's rooms
in the William Pitt Union.

Enough!

What is the issue here? In mid-September, it seemed the hot-
test issue on campus was divestment. Now, it seems, an even
hotter issue is the contest between the black and white activists
to see who can stick it to the other the best.

The issue of divestment now lies buried beneath the rubble
of the BAS shanty. What was supposed to be a protest against
apartheid — apartness — or the separation of blacks and whites
in South Africa, has turned into a tense situation "which is
separating the blacks and whites on the Pitt campus. Isn't that
what we are basically trying to prevent?

Donald Frazier, executive assistant of the BAS, was quoted
in this newspaper on Wednesday as saying the vandals who
wrecked the shanty ”shall be dealt with severely,” but he also
said the police would not be informed, and he warned, ”we
will be seeing you soon.” _ .

Frazier, a student leader, holds a high position in the BAS
and must set an example for the other students, just as mem-
bers of the Student Government Board, Interfraternity Council
and Panhellenic Association must do. His response to the
leveled shanty was no_t consistent with his responsibility.

The issue is becoming lost among the senseless vandalism,
racial slurs, threats of violence and vindictiveness.

The very attitudes Students for a Free South Africa and the
BAS are working to eradicate on another continent are becom-
ing the hallmark of the divestment campaign on our campus.

The destruction of the shanty was in bad taste. Frazier’s
response was bad judgment. This is not a war. The issue at hand
is divestment. Don't forget that.

Sororities: it's all Greek to me

I spoke to my younger sister on
the phone the other day. She was
happy to hear from me, but she
sounded a little upset.

' She was pledging a sorority,
she said, and the anxiety was get-
ting to her. ”Hell Week” was
coming up, and she didn't know
quite what to expect. The name
sounded rather ominous, though.

Angela is a communications
major at a small college in cen-
tral Pennsylvania. She is pretty,

t popular, intelligent and has al-

ways been at the center of her cir-
cle of friends. But my little sister
was a frazzled, nervous wreck.

I've never pledged a sorority,
so I'm a bit in the dark about the
specifics of the sacred ritual.
Those of my acquaintances who
have assured me it's a trying or-_
deal. Angela confirmed this, but
she was convinced the ordeal
was worth it.

After it's all over, she pointed
out, she'll have a whole new fa-
mily of sisters.

What am I, chopped‘ liver?

My affection for my sister has
little to do with the fact that we
have the same parents, and noth-
ing at all to do with her being a
tri-whatever. I don't see why any-
one else’s affection would.

TERESA
CANDORI

I'm sure every frat brother and
sorority sister reading this is al-
ready composing a list of the

benefits of Greekhood, deter- .

mined to convince me of the bliss

of Greek life: lasting friendships,

community service and the

whole bit. It's all just wonderful.
It can also be pretty stupid.

Last year, a girl who lived. in my
dorm pledged a sorority. As a re-
sult, she spent the rest of the
semester on crutches, the victim
of some secret humiliaton she re-
fused to disclose.

I know  isolated incident.

The semester before, two
young men pledged a fraternity;
when one ended up with a rup-
tured eardrum and the other with
a fractured jaw, the university
suspended the fraternity and con-
ducted an investigation.

An exception to the rule, of
course.
Last winter at a small college irL

upstate New York, a young man
died of an alcohol overdose

Cyclists and commuters: second—class

the university has once again dis-
criminated against its bread and

The backbone of the Universi-
ty of Pittsburgh's student popula-

tion historically has been the
commuter from the greater Pitts-
burgh area. Interestingly enough,
the commuter is treated as a sec-
ond—class citizen at Pitt. I have
learned to live with this situation
since I am also a motorcyclist,
and motorcyclists are second-
class citizens to almost everyone,
except fellow motorcyclists.
The university has seen fit to
discriminate against both groups
in a single action, which greatly
dismays me. For as long as ‘I've
been attending Pitt, motorcyclists
have been allowed to park in the
Crabtree Hall parking garage in a

portion of the garage which is in-

accessible to automobiles. How-
ever, [recently] the area has been
posted ”No Motorcycle Parking.”
I can think of no legitimate rea-
son for this action_and feel that

butter — the commuting student.

Perhaps The Wild One was re-
cently on television — and the
administration is trying to protect
the student body from renegade
bikers or perhaps an underem—
ployed administrator did not like
the fact that commuting motorcy-

Racism

I have been reading the letters
to the editor for a while, and I am
tired of the same repetitive rhetor-
ic. The problem of these black
youths committing vandalism
and harassing some white wom-
en needs to be addressed. First of
all we need to stop pointing
fingers at each other and focus on
the roots of the problem. The
banner that used to hang on
Forbes Avenue that said ”Oak-
land — a World Within a City,".,
should have read ”Oaklan‘d

 
    

City Within a Neighborhood,”
because that's what it really is.
The University of Pittsburgh has
built facilities in these youths’
neighborhoods that they cannot
even getvinto. Not [on] any of the
major radio stations can these
youths’ listeningpreference (rap
music) [be heard]. Pittsburgh has
a disturbing lack of social pro-
grams and events that again [do]
not cater to the desires of these
youths. Unremorsefully, this
University of Pittsburgh financial-
ly support[s] a country that is kill-
ing and demoralizing our black
brothers and sisters in South Afri-
ca. The continual socio/econom-
ic problems of overpopulated
living environments, lack of
financial resources and the pres-
sures of severely broken homes
leads [to] one internally angry,
hurt, y9u__ngblack person.

The large majority of Greek or-

When pledges participate in a

be injured or degraded.

But they do it anyway.

 LIVE (I975-I985)
~ Bruce Springsteen and
the E Street Band
, Columbia

By John Mccombe

I admit that l bought it on the day of release. Mind you, I wasn't
one of those people who lined up at the registers at lO a.m.
and waited with feverish anticipation for the delivery truck to or-
rive. But we're talking about more than just a record. This is a
box of Bruce. At nearly three hours and 20 minutes in length,
the album (although still shorter than many of the man's shows)
is the only official documentation of a sacred rock 'n' roll ritual
—— live readings from the gospel according to Bruce.
For many hours l've listened and assessed. Please consider this:
ln the time that it takes to listen to this album, Bill Rodgers could
run 26 miles, shower, shave and dress for a cocktail party; cardi-
ac specialistscould repair three coronary arteries via bypass sur-
" gery; and the group Boston could plug in their amps in
preparation for a recording session. Unfortunately, five records
gives Bruce too much space to fill up with truly essential live
material.
Instead of offering a sampling of the band's party—perfect
covers like John Fogerty's "Ro’ckin' All Over the World" or the
Beatles’ "Twist and Shout," [I've collects 40 Springsteen origi-
nals. The exceptions are Woody Guthrie's "This Land is Your
Land," Edwin Starr's "War" and the album—closing "Jersey 9
Girl” by Tom Waits, which is so Springsteenian that few listeners 
are probably aware of the song's author. What you do get in
your box is a pinch of pre-Born to Run anthems ("lt's Hard to
, be a Saint in the City,” "Growin' Up") and a healthy selection
A ' of album tracks from Born to Run, Darkness on the Edge of Town,
 The River and no less than seven songs from Born in the U.S.A.
Because of the inclusion of three E Street arrangements of songs
from Nebraska, l was certain that the band would flesh out the
skeletal sound of that album. Instead, "Johnny 99," "Reason
 to Believe” and ”Nebraska" retain their prayer-like reserve.
These songs are easily Bruce's most understated efforts but also
his most clearly focused. No one in the audience is pounding
his feet and hands to these songs. Maybe the kids who have
draped themselves in the American flag are too busy scratching
their heads. The image of Springsteen poking a dead dog /'n,a
ditch from "Reason to Believe” is ugly and unpleasant. But ain't
" that Springsteen's America? If you have ever accused Bruce of
ostering false patriotism, then you're-not listening.
Just in case you're not, Springsteen states the obvious in his
monologue that precedes "War." "Blind faith in your leaders
or in anything," he reminds us, "will get you ki|ied." His ser-
mons are well intended, but the subtlety of songs like "Reason
to Believe" is clearly his strength.
Springsteen doesn't always paint such an unflattering portrait-
of America. James Dean rides high in his Mercury '49 in the rol-
' licking "Cadillac Ranch," and the big man,'Clarence Clemons,
blows hard on "Tenth Avenue Freeze Out" and "Rosalita." =
Nearly every Springsteen favorite is included here, butthe big-
’ gest difference between the band's live work and their studio
efforts is the nastier sound of the guitar lines traded between
. Bruce and Miami Steve or Nils Lofgren. There are some obvious
' guitar showcases like "Adam Raised a Cain," but equally as
seering is "Because the Night," which has been begging to be
committed to vinyl since Patti Smith recorded the original (and
still superior) version in l978. ' _
Two of the biggest surprises are acoustic versions of "Thun-
der Road" and "No Surrender," which prove that Springsteen's
compositions retain their power without the typical bombast of
the E Street band. ‘
Bruce waited a long time to release the live material he's been
collecting for the past lO years. He probably listened to these '
recordings in the same way that football players study video
" tapes of their games. | can picture him, headphones in place,
analyzing his performance and plottingthe perfect execution of
' his stage show. I'm relieved that we're finally able to share this
incredible music.
[I've may not be the greatest live album to ever grace _a turn-
table; it's far too sprawling and lacks the unity of sound of The
Band's Rock of Ages. But when they're good, the E Street Band -
is as good as any live band in history. With the release of Bruce.
Sprinsteen and the E Street Band Live, we now have the proof.

THE ‘PITT NEWS, Friday, November 21, 1986'
G  DIARY
The continuing rise of the new wave South

 

By Christine Curcio

The small town of. Athens,
Ga., and the surrounding area
seem an unlikely breeding
ground for musicians to get their
start. But since the early T9805,
a surprising number of them
havemade a dent in the nation-
al music scene. It began with
The B-52$ in early i980, then
R.E.l\/i. kept up the momentum
with a totally different sound.
Guadalcanal Diary is following
through with their own distinctive
blend of Southern—tinged rock
and African rhythms. Their new
album, Jamboree, is their first for
a major label, Elektra. The band
performed at Graffiti last Satur-
day night to an enthusiastic
crowd that was quite unpre-
pared for their set. lt's not every
band that combines the hard-
driving "Dead Eyes," reminis-
cent of L.A.'s X, with a rousing
rendition of "Kumbava."

Prior to their set, lead vocalist

' ‘Murray Attaway, guitarist Jeff

Walls and bassist Rhett Crowe

discussed their music, their pro— ‘

motion as a band and the

" media-controlled music scene.

Getting their start in l98l,
Guadalcanal Diary (along with
drummer John Poe) began with
a critically acclaimed EP, then
moved to a full—length album for
DB Records in Atlanta. Wa//</'ng
in ‘the Shadow of the Big Man
sparked the interest ‘of Elek—
tra/Asylum, who signed them
and re—released the LP on their
lable. Jamboree and Big Man

are very different albums, "be-.

cause we don't go back and
listen to them," according .to
Walls. Found on each LP are
songs whose musical flavor is im-
possible to classify. Many of the
lyrics illustrate stories. that are a
far cry from the boy—meets—girl
pop formula. '

"l think there's enough back-

presents

and the‘

log of pop lyrics without us add-
ing to it," said Attaway, who is
the main lyric writer "only by a
hair.”

"We iust write about things
that strike our fancy. Nothing's
really planned out," said Walls,
who could be referring to "Cat-
tle Prod,” which is about a man
who enioys herding cows
around a little too much.

"Yes, l think the description of
our being a band with a dry and
twisted sense of humor-is very
accurate," said Attaway. He
added, ”Our music comes — I
hate to be mundane — from the
heart." And even though some
of their songs deal with the un-
derside of life, the band's live
performance, with Attaway as a
focal point, has a curious and
endearing note of tenderness.
"Sleepers Awake" and "Pray
For Rain" come immediately to
mind.

Are they pressured musically
to produce hits, now that they
are signed with a maior label?

"lt goes 50 percent both
ways," said Walls. "Half the

time they're saying we need a.

hit, and the other half they're
saying that they signed us know-
ing full well what we are like.
Many companies will sign a
band they don't even like,
knowing they might be money-
makers, so they can turn around
and support bands like us."

"Even independent labels do
that,” said Attaway. "When
we were signed with ‘DB
Records [owned by Danny
Beard], our Big Man LP was their
biggest seller.” They, in turn,
were able to, sign more new
bands to give them exposure."

"So we've been at the top
and the bottom," said Crowe.

Advantages of having a big
label behind them?

”When we perform in even
the small towns, our records are
always in the stores. Elektra has
a whole distribution chain that is
close to impossible for indepen-
dent labels to cover," said
Crowe. "Before, it was frustrat-
ing for us to go to a city, have
a great response but not have
our record available
anywhere."

"DB Records did a great job
at promoting us," said Walls.
"Everywhere we went, people
knew who we were, but the
records wouldn't-be in great
quantity. They couldn't afford to
operate on credit like the big
companies. It's a whole matter
of economics to produce
records, and an independent
only has a certain number of
them to distribute."

According to the media, the
South is currently home of the
new, cool music scene. The
band members discussed the
status of most other cities in the
United States and the compara-
tively small amount of support
thatfledgling bands receive.

"A cool scene depends on a
few people who will stick their
necks out," said Walls. ''If
there's intelligence behind it,
and they're willing to basically
throw $600 away on a chance,
things can get started." Atlan-
ta's Danny Beard of DB Records,
who signed the band originally,
did just that.

"When an album on an in-
dependent label gets attention,
musicians in that area see pos-
sibilities forfinancial gain," said
Crowe. "But if there's no one
around to help them, bands will
think, 'Well, we're going to stay
in the basement forever, so why
keep on with it?’ "

Attaway added, "By the time
the media catches up to some-
thing like this, it's usually over."

This tenacious Philadelphia

musses his hair, following in the
fluffy, meaningless soul tradition

there is no sweet, soulful whin-
ing or nifty hooks to keep this
listener (of dubious character) in-
terested even momentarily.

SHIVERS - .

Directed by Woiciech Marczewski

A complex, scathing indictment of totalitarian repression,
made during the brief thaw of Solidarity and suppressed
during the subsequent crackdown, Shivers is a breakthrough
film for the Polish cinema.Set during the last hysterical-days of

. Stalinist paranoia in the mid-1950's, the story centers on the

political coming-of-age of a teenage boy sent to an elite .
indoctrination camp for budding Communists. Director
Wojc_:iech Marczewski and his talented cinematographer Jerzy
Zi_elinski_ bri,llia,ntly create a jittery, off-balance world filled

with iarring transitions and vivid imagery, veering between the
slapstick and the sinister in its depiction of the strange
complicity between adolescent yearnings, religious mysticism,

V and Party zealotry in a time of confusion and terror.

Preconceptions play a major
and vital role in the way that
people perceive the world
-around them. Movie viewing is
‘no exception to this maxim.
Often. a sub-par movie is en-
ioyed by much of the public be-
cause of all the bad press
circulated beforehand. By set-
ting their expectations low, peo-
ple are pleased if the movie
exceeds, these» expectations,
and therefore they are inclined

to think the film is better than itg;

-actually is.

Conversely, very good films
are often found to be unsatisfy-
ing to the viewer who has read
nothing but accolades for the
film beforehand. Asa movie crit-
ic, l am aware of this problem
and try to avoid it when review-
ing a film. Unfortunately, as
seems to happen with most hu-
mans, l sometimes fall into this
trap and then have to struggle to
decipher my true feelings.

This is the case with the new
film from Jean-Jacques Annaud
called The Name at the Rose,
which is based on the novel by
Umberto Eco. If I decide to pan
this film, many people who wit-

shoots late I950s Paris with the
noirish nostalgia filmgoers ex-
pect, without the cliches such a
movie might conjure up (al
though scenesof Paris in the rain
abound).

Dexter Gordon plays Dale
Turner, an alcoholic tenor saxo-
phone legend who goes to
France because, as he tells a
friend, there are "no cold eyes
in Paris." The truth is he is a
somewhat dried-up musician
who feels he must escape the
greedy American love for
profitab/e jazz and disrespect
for the black man. France offers
him the love that he sorely lacks
at home. Bebop is king in the
Parisian nightclubs, and the be-
bop legends accord enormous
respect on the streets of France.

Dale befriends Francois
(played by Francois Cluzet) who
abandons his daughter at night
to listen to Dale through a win-

dow in the cold and rainy street
outside the Blue Note Club.
Eventually Francois meets his
idol and takes him in as a board-
er in order to re-form his healthy
state of creativity. Francois
places Dale's welfare ahead of
his own and especially his
daughter's (which is somewhat
hard to accept). It matters very
little to Francois that Dale can't
afford to pay rent and has trou-
ble staying out of trouble. Dale
inspires Francois more than his
estranged wife, his neglected
daughter or even his own artis-

tic career. Dale inspires Francois ,

 Francois mothers Dale.

Dale plays at the Blue I\Iote
Club with friends Herbie Han-

cock (who scored the film), John ,

McLaughlin, Billy Higgins and
Wayne Shorter. Even when
Dale's playing is lazy, if not en-
tirely amateurish (especially in

his reading of "As Time Goes
By"), the ecstatic French au-
dience honors its hero — out of
sheer gratitude for a legend —
with heartfelt applause. The ex-
patriate thus finds a home in the
love of the_French audiences.

Dexter Gordon's performance
as Dale Turner is natural. Con-
sidering that this is his first acting
role, it mightbe unfair to say that

his acting ability in Round Mid- I

night far outshines his playing
ability. In reality, Gordon's own
legend mirrors the character he
performs in the movie as much as
pianist Bud Powell and tenor
saxophonist Lester Young (once
both friends of Gordon's as well
as the models for the screen-
play). Gordon's screen debut is
stunning even though his musi-
cianship is slightlyless sparkling
than it once was.

Round Midnight is less a docu-
ment of Dale's life than of Fran-
cois' account of love for Dale.
Tavernier has constructed a
paean to a lifeforce that is jazz;
a beauty which ensconces the
mutually bleak urban landscapes

\ of both Paris and New York.

When Dale is looking at one of
Francois’ paintings he says, "the
‘colors, colors of Ravel and Tadd
Dammeron." This poetic ode
expresses the interchangeability
‘of artistry which explains how
Tavernier might have filmed this
movie. Like a Mark Rothko paint-
ing, Round Midnight is an ex-
pressionist film where little
emotion is conveyed or con-
trived on the surface with the
hope that the viewer can feel
what is going on beneath the
textures. This is where Taverni-
er is going to lose a lot of
viewers. .

These "colors" crucially limit
the appeal of the film to an au-
dience. Many relationships and
feelings are implied throughout
the film which seem to threaten
the film's assumed authenticity.
We hear the music and witness
how these people live through
the music, but the reality, which
is always at the fringe of the film,
never properly pervades the sur-

reality of Dale's world‘ or Taver- «

nier's film. In other words, it's a
good bet that if you're not a mu-
sician and you're not much of a
jazz fan, then you're not really
going to care too much about
Round Midnight. That's a shame
too, because it's not a bad film
at all, just esoteric in appeal.

Post Script: The music, which

occupies a great deal of the‘

film's script, was performed live
by Gordon, Hancock, Mclaugh
Iin, Higgins and Shorter with
support from Freddie Hubbard,
Ron Carter, Bobby Hutcherson,
Lonette McKee who all make
cameos in the fi m) as 'well as
Bobby lVlcFerrin and Chet Bak-
er. The soundtrack, available on
Columbia Records, sounds like a
Blue Note record straight out of
the I950s withdigital sound and
six sessions worth of talent. As
a jazz record, it stands among
the strongest efforts of the year
on its’ own merit in addition to

Etfeoting poetry for the far left

CONTENDERS
Easterhouse
Columbia

By John Young

Easterhouse songs ring with
the echo of dense, metallic-
sounding guitars and singer
Andy Perry's voice calling up
from the cavernous depths of
working-class hardship. Easter-
house's members all claim mem-
bership in Britain's revolutionary
Communist Party and, while the

songs on their LP Contenders are ~

electric with revolutionary fer-
vor, they're intelligent enough to
avoid rehashed ideologies and
sloganeering like so many other
communist “artists.”

Easterhouse lyrics act as at-
fecting poetry for the far left.
Vivid description helps bring
songs like "Nineteen Sixty
Nine,” a stinging condemnation
of England's Labour Party, to
life: It seems that / remem-
ber/Scattered shreds of for off
days/T he savage beat of so/-
diers' feet/On streets of broken
g/ass. Easterhouse clearly de-
tails its commitment to change
and sees its implementation
coming through an awareness
the band itself hopes to faster.
Take a thought/Give it f/ight/A
breath of hope/A ray of light,
Andy Perry sings in "lnspi-
ration."

The band's songs are full of
lasting images of people facing
everyday struggles and search-
ing for credible solutions. "Es-
tates" is at once a cry against

the kind of life fostered in state-
supported, U.K. housing pro]-
ects, a cynical stab at religion —
We were made to /oy down in
a posture of stone/Beside dark
waters and some stee/ trac/<s -

 

and a harrowing consideration
of what future generations are to
face — Do we curse the chi/d/T o

life reduced to little more than
push and pu// and an end/ess
grind [that] ta/<es away every-

thing (from "To Live Like This"),
Easterhouse sees a widespread
wiping away of the world's
stagnation as the only real solu-
tion to man's problems.

In response to their lyrics, the
music of Easterhouse kicks,
pounds and tantalizes appropri-
ately to nearly every song's
point. "Whistling in the Dark"
sounds full throughout, while lvor
Perry and Mike Murray's chang-
ing guitar work alters the song's
tone with clanging, rhythmic
verses turning into looser,

_ picking-filled choruses. The gui-

tar frenzy of "Get Back to Rus-
sia" builds expertly around
Gary Rostock's monumental
backbeat. And the record's mu-
sical high point, "Nineteen Six-
ty Nine," is buoyed by a
memorable melody and chilling
dynamic shifts.

Contenders is not without its
weaker songs, however. The

lyrics and guitar riffs in "Cargo
of Souls" become entirely too
repetitive in the song's four
minutes and 54 seconds, and
Rostock's loud, busy drumming
doesn't help either. "Lenin in
Zurich" is troubling as well, its
music dry and plodding, and its
lyrical idea of revolutionary
greatness being fostered by
hate more than love is dis-
turbing.

Easterhouse's open political
considerations and Andy Perry's
angry but seemingly unaffected
voice have enough power to be
unsettling for many a listener.
Wherever you stand in the po-
litical spectrum, it's hard to imag-
ine the music of Easterhouse not
either angering or encouraging
you somehow. And if you're
moved, in whatever direction,

- it's likely this band is accomplish-

K that praise, then most likely they
will be disappointed and
wonder where my head was
when I committed my views to
paper. To avoid this dilemma, I
will take the easy way out and
remain indecisive about the film.

One of the main problems that
I had with the film had to do with
one of my preconceived notions.
l was eager to see F. Murray
Abraham perform in his first role
since his award-winning por-
trayal of Salieri in Amadeus. l
was sorely disappointed to find
that Abraham was in the film for
less than l5 minutes. He was su-
perb in his brief appearance,
and i am eagerly awaiting h_is
next starring role. His acting
overshadowed Sean Connery's
as well as almost everyone
else’s. Abraham did not appear
until the end of the movie, and,
when he did, the rest of the film
paled in comparison.

Another criticism that I had
was the length. The Name of the
Rose suffers from the some oil-
ment as Tai-Pan. It is difficult to
convert an involved work of fic-

have either shortened the story
and kept the running time the
same, thus providing more time
to develop the plot and to pay
more attention to the setting, or
increased the film length so that
the same goals could be accom-

tion into a movie. This film should .

plished. By trying to straddle the
two, the film was choppy, and
an even flow of events was

’ never established.

Sean Connery was better as

’ James Bond than as William of

Baskerville in The Name at the
Rose. He was not believable in
his portrayal of a Franciscan
monk. The rest of the cast was
hand—picked because of their
appearances. Annaud tried to
choose cast members with
Gothic looks best representing
the period. Connery was the
only monk who looked like a
movie star, and this dettacted
from his role. This is possibly
what Annaud was looking for,
but if it was, he picked the
wrong man for the part, for Can-
nery's acting was unconvincing.

The production for this film
was impressive. An 800-year-
old monastery located in West
Germany served as the interior
setting of the movie. lvluch time
and effort was spent in making

the setting realistic and as close

to authentic as possible. Giant
candelabra that weighed 2,000
pounds were handmade in Italy
exclusively for the film. The en-

tire exterior structure was con— -

structed for the movie on a
hilltop outside of Rome. The
producers tried to- make this
structure as close as posssible to

el. All their labors provided a
seemingly realistic look at what
a l3th century monastery must
have looked like.

The story itelf is interesting and
centered on the mysterious
deaths of some monks. The
dead are found with a black-
ened finger and a blackened
tongue. The mystery seems to
revolve around the monastery’s
massive library that is kept secret
to almost all of the monks. Some
intriguing ideas crop up through-
out the course of conversation
that relate to the lifestyles of
monks and their views of
religion. Although i have not
read the book, it appears that a
lot of it has been well represent-
ed in the film.

I could say more about the ac-
tors and the technical staff and
what they added to the film, but
I think that l have already said
too much. This film was very
hard to judge because it was en-
ioyable, yet oddly unsatisfying
for some of the reasons already
mentioned. To top off this
review, I guess it seems only ap-
propriate that l remain indifferent
in my numerical rating of the film.

On a scale of l-to l0 this
movie rates: 5.

sound like females, and con-
versely some females can sound
like men. Also, the musicians‘ still

_ True As Stee/ is Warlock’s
debut album on ivlercury Rec-
ords and the first one available
in the United States. They come

, from a rather impoverished sec-
I tion of the country, and much of

their music reflects this back-
ground. _

This album starts out with quite
a flourish. The first two son 5 on

the disc, ”l\/lr. Gold” and" Fight

f‘ for Rock," are well written and

sung with conviction. When
Pesch sings Hear the message/
Don't touch my music!/ We're
ready to fight, she conveys her
attitude about rock very effec-

thing in life worth fighting for,
and that is her freedom to sin
and to be part of a band whic
is committed to music.

After these two songs, the al-
bum declines rapidly, and the
only other song worth notin is

which a ain relates to her rather
harsh lige. The rest of True As
Stee/ falls into a pattern of bland
music with rather inane lyrics.
Pesch overextends her writing
ability and then tries to tackle the
subject of love. The results of this
are almost laughable, and the
songscontain none of the con-
viction of the first two.

There is promise on this album,
although it is going to take a lot
of war to refine it into something
of value. Or, to put it in proper

FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 21, 1986, F 

By Thomas Danyluk
Staff Writer

Question concerning the
mathematics of Pitt football
'86: What comes after No. 1?
Why, No. 2, of course. -

After tangling with the top-
ranked Miami Hurricanes two
weeks ago, the Pitt Panthers
must now line up against
another powerhouse — the
Penn State Nittany Lions. Joe
Paterno's generi—clad outfit
needs just one more win to in-
sure themselves of a Jan. 2
confrontation with the Hurri-
canes. And, in addition to the
age-old rivalry between the
schools, Pitt would like noth-
ing more than to play the
spoﬂen V .

"We'd love to beat them,”
said the Panthers’ |atest'start-
ing quarterback, Joe Felitsky.
"We were pretty pumped up
for Miami, and it's been like
that way this week‘ in
practice.”

Remember the year 1981?
Pitt, under Jackie Sherrill,
came into this annual brawl
sporting a glossy 11-1 record
and heading toward a nation-
al title showdown with Geor-
gia in the Sugar Bowl. Then,
Penn State snuck into Oakland
and easily smashed the Pan-.
thers and their hopes 48-14.

Last season, Foge Fazio’s
team had a golden "eye for an
eye” opportunity to return the
disfavor, but lay down like
lambs when the Lions came
calling — 31-0, PSU. Now
Mike Gottfried has the oppor-
tunity to spoon out the upset
medicine.

''It's a great opportunity to
match up against the No. 2
team, even though I'm not so

sure that they're not the No. 7
team/"he said. "They're pret-
ty solid defensively. They have
given up some yardage, but
what they do well is keep peo-
ple out of the end zone. Offen-
sively, they're a solid running
team, but they can throw the
football. [QB] Shaffer has real-
ly come on this year  but we
have to slow down their run-
ning game to be able to stay
with them.”

Unlike Miami, the Nittany
Lions don't thrive on the
quick-strike, blitzkrieg offense
in toppling opponents. Pater-
no's game is staunch defense
and Swiss-time ball control.
Give them an inch, and they'll
take an inch, then continue
inching their way towards the
goal line. Runs by Manoa and
Dozier, then an occasional
aerial from Shaffer to their elu-
sive wide-outs. Simple, but
consistently effective.

True, Penn State hasn't been
particularly dominating in
their last two victories over
Maryland and Notre Dame,—
the combined winning margin
in both games was a mere

seven points. But that doesn't

sway Gottfried's opinion of his
upcoming opponent.

"lt's been said that people
have had success against them
in the last two weeks. Well,
the main thing is that they've
won, and that's what counts,"
he stressed.

Paterno, despite the success
his team has enjoyed this year,
does_n't think his team is
breathing easy going against
the 5-4-1 Panthers. "We've
worked very hard to get into
this position,” he said. '’I don't
think there will be any let-
down after. coming this far."

Well, maybe?

The Pitt Panthers destroyed the
Melbourne Tigers, a touring team

from Australia, in an exhibition

game at Fitzgerald Field House
by a score of 92-55 last night.

Pitt jumped out to an early 15-7
lead and never looked back.
Junior -forward Demetreus Gore
was the star of the game in the
first half as he scored 14 points,
most of which came on a variety
of acrobatic moves.

For starters, Gore naileda short
jumper on a double pump fake
and minutes later drove the base-
line and dunked as the Panthers
pulled away from the complete-
lyout-manned Melbourne team.

Gore concluded his scoring
spree with a left-handed hook
shot from close in and a reverse
jam off a feed from center Tico
Cooper. J __ A
' But while Gore's scoring was

 

better. Gore led the Panthers with

nine assists on the night and con-‘

tinually gave the ball up on the
fast break — even on a four-on-

’ none where he fed sophomore

forward Jerome Lane for the jam.

Obviously Gore's coach was
pleased with his effort. ''I thought
Demetreus did a real good job,"
said Pitt coach Paul Evans. "He
took over in the first half when
Curtis [Aiken] wasn't shooting

. well."

Aiken's shooting slump didn't
last long, though. The senior cap-
tain finished thegame with 26
points to lead the Panthers in
scoring. Aiken was 1 1 of 19 from
the field, including four 3-point
field goals. 4

Pitt entered the halftime lock-

" er room with a more than com-

fortable 50-31 lead, and things

"got better in the second half. The
Panthers. began the half with a.
21-8 scoring spree, largely the

result of Lane's dominance on the

boards. After a disappointing first _

 

team defeats Australia

half, Lane came a_|ive pulling
down numerous rebounds and"
scoring eight points in a two-
minute span as Pitt raced to a
71-32 lead. Lane finished the
game with 13 rebounds.

It was an impressive showing
by the Panthers, especially con-
sidering the fact that this same
Melbourne team defeated
Georgetown three nights ago.
What does this say about Pitt? ‘'1
don't know," said Evans. "They
[Melbourne] have been traveling
a lot, and they're busing it instead
of flying."

Obviously Evans doesn't want
to get involved in that type of
hype -— and for good reason —
but his Panthers definitely

showed top 20 potential last

night. 1 '1

Another first time starter was
sophomore center Tabatha

including six of nine from the
floor. There had been some
confusion as to who would
start at the center position. Jen-
ny Tyner, a 6-5 senior, started
at center last year but made
way for Long in the (game.
”Jenny has been a little incon-
sistent; we had to go with who
we thought would get the job

Patty Paul, another senior

Big East volleyball champions

Pitt-Penn State, Penn State-Pitt;

« - the question is: Are the Nittany

Lions overlooking the Panthers?

"As the football team heads for
Happy Valley, the women's vol-.

leyball team will be hosting the

.Big East tournament in the Fitz-

gerald Field House. The Lady
Panthers, 7-0 in conference play,
are the top seed.

The Lady Panther volleyball
team has a point to make this
weekend. Over a year ago, Pitt
was ranked 17th in the nation.
The team was consistently
plagued by injuries but was still
the heavy favorite to win the con-
ference crown.

Last year, Providence not only
robbed the Lady Panthers- of a Big
East title but also an NCAA tour-
nament bid. This year, it is a
healthy Pitt squad that's looking
for a championship.

This is the fifth consecutive
year that the Lady Panthers have
gone into the Big East tournament

The Lady Panthers will open up
against eighth-ranked Seton Hall
Saturday morning at 11:30. Pitt

defeated the Pirates earlier this

season, three games to zero.

Saturday night, the winner of
the Syracuse-Boston College
match will play the winner of the
Pitt-Seton Hall match-up at 8 p.m.
The projected semi-final oppo-
nents are Pitt and Syracuse.

Although the Lady Panthers
have not previously played
against SU this season, Pitt knows
that they can not take the Orange-

Coach Shelton Collier pointed
out that, in the event of a
Syracuse—Pitt semi-final match,
”We would be playing a rematch
of last year's semi-finals. Winning
is just a matter of us playing our
best.” Collier added, ’’I think that
we're in a good position to win.”

Providence, ranked second in
the tournament, is expected to be
in the championship match.

match between Pitt and Provi-
dence. The Lady Friars have
defeated Pitt in two of the last
three Big East title matches.

Pitt took the title in '82 and '84.
The Friars won it in '83 and last
year. This time, the Lady Panthers
will do battle on their home
court, and they are out for blood.

Providence has an impressive
39-7 record (9-1 in conference
play) and is ranked second, but
Pitt has already defeated the Lady

' Friars earlier this season in three

quick matches.

Coach Collier stated, ”We beat.

Providence earlier in the season,
and I think we have improved a
great deal since then.”

Should Pitt play either Villano-
va or Georgetown in the finals,
the Lady Panthers would still be
the favored team. Pitt has beaten
both the Hoyas and the Wildcats
twice during the regular season.

”Mentally, we are ready for the

.1. .;,._...;-. 2... V‘  .. ,  .._.». ..t

tournament as a result of our
playing schedule,” said Coach
Collier. ”Of the 12 matches that
we have lost, 11 of them were
against teams that are nationally
or regionally ranked."

Pitt has been forced to play
teams like Santa Barbara, Penn
State and Notre Dame through-
out the season. Competition of
this calibre has provided an add-
ed edge for use against Pitt's op-
ponents this weekend. The Lady
Panthers have been forced to
toughen up in order to win. This
added ”toughness” has made Pitt
a much improved team.

Collier noted, ” We are confi-
dent that with our losses to
ranked teams, we have deve-

loped into the team that will win

the Big East.”

The Big East tournament is a
showcase for talent. Last year's
tournament MVP, Karen Ferreria,
(Providence’s setter) will be play-

hips at Pitt ,

 

ing along with teammate Barb
Prehaptney. Georgetown will
field two of the best spikers in the
East (Kathy Taylor and Justine
Metz). And of course, Lady Pan-
thers Noreen Coughlin, Denise
Frawley, Sue Hoover, Nora Mul-
vihill, Louise O’Shaughnessey
and Lisa Stewart will provide the
opposing teams with a few
headaches.

At the end of this season, Pitt
will lose senior captain Sue
Hoover to graduation. Hoover
said, ’’I’m really excited to be
playing in my last Big East tour-
nament. lt's kind of sad to think
that this is it, but that also moti-
vates me to go out a winner.”

It would appear that the whole
team is-psyched for the match
with Providence. As Hoover
pointed out, ”The team still feels
the stinging loss to Providence
from last year. We'll be ready to

play and win this time around." ‘ ‘

The Big East to most of us
means exciting, big-time
basketball, and this year, more
than ever, Pitt appears to have
a legitimate shot to be in the
hunt for the conference cham-
pionship. -

This Sunday at 2 p.m. at
Fitzgerald Field House, there
is another Big East champion-
ship to be won, this one in
women's volleyball. Pitt enters
the tournament with a 7-0 Big
East record, and with the sup-
port of the student body, it
hopes to'win another Big East
championship.

This is the last home event
for the women's team this sea-
son, and if Pitt wins the Big
East championship, it "will

NCAA Tournament, so Satur-
day's game will determine the
fate of the Lady Panthers. Last
year, Pitt lost the Big East
Championshipto Providence,
at Providence, and a suppor-

game could spur the Lady Pan-
thers on to victory.

So in support of the wom-

show the Big East our school's
pride and enthusiasm, come to
the semi-finals on Saturday at
8 p.m. or the finals on Sunday
at 2 p.m. I'm certain you will

Villanova invades Trees Pool tomorrow

By Beth Froelich
Staff Writér

Pitt's men's and women's swim
teams challenge their Big East
foe, the Villanova Wildcats, at
Trees Pool Saturday starting at 1
p.m. The women's and men's
teams view Villanova in different
lights, though.

The Pitt women's swim team
beat Villanova last season by the

considerable margin of 89 to 41 ,

while the men's swim team was
defeated by Villanova 64 to 49.
”We’re not sure what to expect
this year,” commented Pitt wom-
en's swimming coach David Bel-
owich. ”Vil|anova has a big team
with a lot of depth and a few

- talented freshmen additions.”

The only thing that may stand

in the women's team's way is the-
fact that the majority of their’

swimmers have been plagued

with the flu for the past couple of

meets.

”We don't take’the meet
against Villanova lightly,” said
Belowich. ”We shall use our

. regular season lineup. They shall

especially provide a challenge for
our sprinters.”

The entire scenario, so deftly
scripted by the Fiesta Bowl, to set
up what amounts to a one-game
national championship playoff
could fall apart Saturday.

If second-ranked Penn State’

loses to Pitt and No. 3 Oklaho— -

ma loses to No. 5 Nebraska, the
Orange Bowl would have No. 1
Miami against 1 Nebraska and
would come out smelling like a
rose.

Pitt at No. 2 Penn State (by 14):
Penn State 24-7.

No. 3 Oklahoma (by 8) at No.
5 Nebraska: upset special of the
week  Nebraska 17-14.

was: 35 right, 13 wrong, two ties.

week's mark was: 16-19-1.

Belowich predicted that fresh-
man Laurie Walczak, junior Judy
Haughton, freshman Sandy Al-
bright, sophmore Tricia Rickert,
senior Sue Hickman and senior
Jodi O'Neil will have a good
meet against Villanova.

’’If we swim to our capabilities
on Saturday, we should be fine,”.
added Belowich. ”This meet
gives us the opportunity to swim
our regular events with good
competition.

”Villanova has a good front
line and the depth to back it up,"
he continued. ”This meet will be
a good step toward swimming ex-
cellent times at the Penn State In-
vitational next month.”

Meanwhile, the Pitt men's
swimming team has bittersweet
memories of Villanova. They lost
to thewildcats in the dual meet
last year but beat them in the Big
East championships.

Will this year be any different?
”We won't be razor sharp for this
meet like Villanova will be,” said
Pitt men's coach Fred Lewis.
”Our objective is to train hard
throughout the fall and aim
toward the Big East champion-

ships. We want to consistently
improve throughout the year and
get our best times at the end of
the year.”

Villanova swimmers Chris
Craft, Pete Maloney, Blaize Mat-
thews and Doug Camburn are
the Wildcats’ top swimmers.
Maloney holds the fastest time in
the Big East for the 50-yard
freestyle.

’’If we continue to improve like
we did last week, we should be
highly successful,” said Lewis-

”All I can ask of the swimmers is ‘

their lifetime best effort. I ask that
they mentally swim the smartest
races of their careers and that
they give physically all they have.
If they do both’, we will have a
good meet.”

Lewis looks for Pitt senior Tom
Shaulinski and sophomore Mark
Dombrowski to swim well in

Saturday's meet because they '

have looked extremely sharp in
practice this week.

The Pitt men's diving team will
also ‘face a challenge competing
against Villanova this weekend.

Villanova has two top divers,’

Dave Echeverria, who finished

third in the Big East last year on
the 1-meter board, and Rob
McDonald.

Both of Pitt’s' men's and wom-
en's diving teams will have to be
sharp if they are to place first on
the boards this weekend. Pitt
coach Julian Krug is happy with
the performances he _has seen
from the team thus far.

He predicts that Pitt divers
juniorChris_gB_lair_and seniorJack

1'3

Shuten will perform well in the
meet against Villanova. He also
added ‘ that sophomore Vernon
Yenick has shown a good deal of
improvement in the past weeks
and should provide good compe-
tition against Villanova.

Pitt freshman John Sharky will
be a new face diving this week.
Krug looks for good things to
come from this former age group

national champi_onship finalist. -
