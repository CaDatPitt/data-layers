"They can raise tuition, raise
parking fees, hold enrollments,
and accept more money from the
state, and then they can turn
around and claim that they

couldn’t and can’t afford the addi- ‘

tional $5,843 per year to keep
urgently needed and often slated
promises to an academic unit,”
geography graduate students said
in a written statement concerning

the termination of the geography
department.

How do you terminate a depart-
ment? What happens to the stu-
dents enrolled in that department?

For graduate and undergraduate
students in Pitt’s geography
department, the questions are all
too familiar.

The geography department will
cease to exist after Aug. 31, 1983 if
the termination proposal submit-
ted by Faculty of Arts and Sciences

Dean Jerome Rosenberg becomes
effective.

Low enrollment, research prob-
lems and cost are some of the rea-
sons cited by the university for the
termination.

The proposal to eliminate the
department has to be approved by
Chancellor Wesley Posvar. '

According to the dean’s propos-
al, undergraduate students who
have elected majors in geography
will be allowed to complete the

No graduate students will be

after the fall of 1982. The current
graduate students will be allowed
to complete master’ degrees within
the statute of limitations.

Red Tape
Means Delays
In Student Aid

Students still waiting to hear
whether they have received any
financial aid can thank new federal
regulations for student aid and
tardy government decisions for the
delay about eligibility.

Daniel May of the office of
Admissions and Student Aid,
said his office has a backlog of
aid applications because of the‘
bureaucratic requirements.

“It's a real nightmare,” he said.

Because the Department of Edu-
cation was late this year in issuing
key rules about eligibility, many
students are unaware of what is
required in applying for aid, May
said.

This not only causes problems
for students, but adds to the diffi-
culties of the financial aid staff,
according to May.

“We’ve been unable to effectively
cominimicate necessary informa-
tion to students,” he said. “It’s also
been tough on the people who deal
with the students."

The financial aid office deals
with a variety of federal aid pro-
grams, such as the state guaranteed
loan prograiii, Pennsylvania
Higher Education Assistance
Agency loans, campus loans,
;.-;r;i::~; for students in the health
t)i:.\lt‘fsSl!J!H and more.

For this '.|C2t(l(’Itll(‘ year. the fol-
lowing clianges have occurred in
these major federal aid programs:

0 Two hundred thousand fewer
students will receive Pell Grants
this year. The budget for these

grants has been trimmed from
$2.35 billion to $2.28 billion.

0 Social security benefits for col-
lege students will be reducedby 45
percent. Students who were not
enrolled in college by May 1 will
receive no benefits.

0 College Work Study Programs
and State Incentive Grant Pro-
grams, along with new funds for
National Direct Student Loans,
have been cut by 4 percent.

0 The Supplemental Educa-
tional Opportunity Grant Pro-
gram has been trimmed by 25
percent.

0 Some funding for a number of
these programs may be restored if
President Reagan signs a pending
appropriations bill. ‘

O For next year, however May is
not optimistic thatfunding foraid
pro grams will be increased.

0 “The best we can hope for is
what we got this year,” he said.

May offered the following advice
to students applying for aid:

0 Apply on time. The later an
application is received, the longer.
it will take to be processed.

0 Make sure the application is
complete.

If it is incomplete, it will cause
delays in notification and receiving
aid.

0 If you have questions, make an
appointment with the financial aid
office.

Advertisements like this are
common to students who live off
campus in Oakland and area
neighborhoods. The last weeks
of each winter term and through
most of the summer, students
search for apartments that will be
their home for the coming school
year

Unlike many universities, apart-
ments around Pitt are hard to
come by because of the location.
Not only students need housing;
hospital personnel and non-

- . university related residents who
* 1" live in Oakland do also. All three

groups combine to make this
section of the city very crowded.

Marylou Sosso Off
Campus Housing
Coordinator

Marylou Sosso, coordinator of

,/Pitt’s Off Campus Housing

' Office, said the housing situation
in Oakland now is not a “big prob-
lem” like it has been in the past.

The reason for that is twofold.
The Off Campus Housing Office
has been able to-persuade stu-
dents to live in areas other than
Oakland. For example, Shady-
side, Point Breeze and Squirrel
Hill are now being invaded by Pitt
students.

Forum:

Off Campus Housing

The office has also expanded
its roommate listings Sosse said.
If a student cannot ﬁnd an apart-
ment on his own, he can look in
the “Roommate Needed" ﬁle, if
he does not mind sharing a place
with a stranger.

The “Roommate Needed" list-
ings are green cards from which
an apartment hunter can dis-
cover who needs a roommate,
where the apartment is located,
how much the rent is and other
special preferences, such as non-
smoking or quiet students.

The Off Campus Housing
Office is a service to the students
and it cannot get involved in com-
plaints students have about their
landlords or buildings Socco
said.

According to Sosso, the most
common problems heard at the
office are money-related. Stu-
dents often have difficulty getting
their security deposits back after
they leave a place. Students also
complain about high rents or the
infrequency of repairs. Any stu-
dent with problems is imme-
diately referred to the Legal
Awareness Committee of Pitt’s
Student Government Board.

Beth Kennen . Legal
Awareness
Committee

Beth Kennen, a member of
the Legal Awareness Committee
(LAC), echoed Sosso's com-
ments and said most of the
tenants‘ complaints are about
their landlords. The top com-
plaint is the tough time students
have in getting their security dep-
osits back from their landlords.

The LAC has lawyers on
retainer, paid with the student
activities fee, who can help stu-
dents with their landlord-related
problems. The lawyers, Kennen
said, will advise the students of
their outlets——magistrate, health

department—-if they cannot work »

it out by themselves.

The LAC has received up to
five calls a day from students who
are having problems with their liv-
ing arrangements.

Many students go to their
classes, return to their apartment,
blare the stereo and never realize
that they are disturbing their
neighbors who are. not students.

Jeff Jameson South
Oakland Citizens
Council

Jeff Jameson, the community
organizer for South Oakland Citi-
zens Council, said noise is one of
the major complaints lodged
against students by area

. residents.

Litter is also a major problem.
Students who frequent the fast
food restaurants are more than
likely to leave their empty bags
and cups laying in the gutter. The
number of fast food restaurants
also eliminates the chance of sit-
down type establishments from
opening, Jameson said.

Another problem that exists is
the presence of the students
themselves.

“Many of the older people feel
threatened by youth," Jameson
said. "They tend to mistrust

. someone who's new, whdslnot a
native.” .

 

 

Perhaps the most important
complaint is the student's lack of
involvement in community
affairs, such as voting.

"Students should realize that
they have to live for Oakland, not
for Pitt," Jameson said. "They
have to take a part in the
community."

Students living in Oakland
bring advantages also he said.
The increase in “foot traffic" dur-
ing the school year makes the
streets somewhat safer than
other paits of the city.

“There's more traffic at night,
especially in the Belleﬁeld area
where the fraternities are," Jame
son said.

Students also provide extra
income to the community and
help the small businesses stay in
business.

Jameson said the landlord-
tenant relationship is a twoway
street but more complaints are
voiced by the tenants then vice
versa. High rent is the major com-
plaint, he said.

“Landlords are generally in the
low to middle class economic

bracket and feel justiﬁed charg-
ing higher rents because the stu-
dent's parents are in a higher tax
bracket," Jameson said.

The rent of Oakland apart-
ments is comparable to many in
places like Shadyside, but the
quality of the Oakland apart-
ments is not worth the money.
Because the demand for housing
is so great in this area, most land-
lords take advantage of it and
raise the rent often. -

"Landlords raise the‘ rent but
don't realize what it’s doing to
older people on fixed incomes,”
Jameson said.

Many of the local landlords feel
justified in raising the rent, but the
"big time realtorsjust don’t care,"
he said. '

Appearance’s

. Sake

Has the Pac—Man generation grown up?

Perha'ps it is starting to, despite assertions to the
contrary. _

For example, political cartoonist Gary Trudeau,
who draws the Doonesbury strips, said during a
college commencement exercise this spring that
today’s college students are only interested in Pac-
Man and Preppie handbooks.

lt’s true that in the ’80s you’re not likely to see
hordes of students marching in the streets. It’s doubt-
ful, too, that this year a group of students might.
attempt to take over the campus and move into the
chancellor's office.

But political activism in the ’60s was less an
option than a moral necessity. Would you keep quiet
if your friends were being shipped off to Vietnam to
be killed?

Of late, college students have spent their time
streaking, destroying fraternity . houses (as in
“Animal House”), polishing their docksiders and
looking for letters of recommendations from admin-
istrators when l0 years ago, they wouldn’t have
wanted to be in the same room with them.

At least it appears that way on the surface.

If you look a little deeper, you might find that
recently———very recently, as in the past year—some
students have begun to get involved again, to join
groups and committees and organizations interested
in expressing viewson national issues.

Last year, Pitt saw the resurgence of student politi-
cal groups that had been dormant—such as the
Young Republicans—alo‘ng with the formation of
new groups, such as the Arms Race Study Group and
the Progressive Student Network. I

Some of the new groups are concerned with cut-
backs in student aid, others with the danger of the
arms race and still others with student participation
in political campaigns.

It would not be accurate to assume that this new
(possibly) trend means it’s time to expect the campus
to unite in outrage against the tyranny of the admin-
istration. As a recent article in The Washington Post
pointed out, this summer's crop of interns in
Washington was as conservative as their New Right
inentors. '

Still, it’s something to say that not everyone is
concerned with roller skates and disco dancing. It's
too simplistic to decide we’re all going to grow up to
be MBAs and that it’s not safe to trust anyone under
30. No, you can’t judge a person by his hair, clothes
or music anymore. Now you have to search further
than appearances. . S

A View    
From The
Far Left

By MARY KANE

We believe that President Rea
gan has not gone far enough with
his cuts in student. aid.

To effectively balance the budget
while at the same time strengthen
the country’s defenses, it is neces-
sary for all good Americans to
tighten their belts. Students are no
exception. The outrage against the
cuts is unwarranted and selfish,
and we believe it should be
stopped.

In addition, it's necessary to rec-
ognize that a strong defense is a
strong offense. Upholding Ameri-
ca’s military‘ strength, and its
energy independence, means push-
ing for the development of nuclear
weapons and nuclear power
plants. There's actually “no hard
scientific evidence that nuclear
power is dangerous. Keep inumind
that more people have gotten sick
over Jane Fonda's movies than at
Three Mile Island.

Another issue about which we're
concerned is academic freedom
during a time when national secur-
.ity is of titmostconcem. The far left
philosophies of knee—jerk liberal
professors cannot be tolerated
when the Soviet threat is looming
larger day by day. Besides, everyone
knows that the nonsense about aca-
demic freedom is used only to cover
communist professors who force
their beliefs on naive students.

Finally, we think the liberalisms
of the '60s that brought an abun-
dance of student rights should be
reversed. Obviously, Pitt's own vis-
itation policy is a good example.
It's a ‘waste of time to simply reduce
visitation hours. Instead. single-
sex dorms should be established,
without any visitation rights. The
addition of a dress code should also
be considered. ‘

Surprised? Disgusted? Out-
raged? You should be; that's what
an editorial page is for. To express
beliefs; whether iserious or tongue
in cheek. The editorial page of a
student newspaper is the student
voice. The Pitt _\'euns staff expresses
its own ideas tltrough its editorials.
but we open the rest of the paper up
to you. Its your right as students.
professors, or staff tneml)(-rs to say
what you think about issues affect-
ing Pitt. the state, the nation and
the world. '

\\'e look forward to hearing from
you.

Paying Back Your Loan

Chances are when you signed for
your loans, you didn't want to
think about paying them back. But
pay them back you must, and the
strategy for loan repayment can
often be confusing and difficult.

Most loan repayments begin a
few months after the borrower
leaves school. The old 7 percent
loans have a grace period of nine
months, and the schedule for 6 per-

cent loans is seven months after‘

graduation. While the suggested
minimum payment on loans is $30
a month, the payment must be at
least enough so that the loan is
aid back within 10 years. Because
" of that, most loan payments are set
at no more than $100 per month for
a 10 year period.
Payment on loans is postponed
while a student attends school on at
least a half-time basis. Those on

Repayment may also be deferred
for up to one year if the student is
unable to find employment. Other
repayment deferments include
internships, post-graduate work,
disability of borrower or spouse
and approved vocational rehabili-
tation programs. But be warned-
the federal government keeps up
on the interest on government sub-
sidized loans during all
deferments.

An applicant has his loan sub-

sidized by the government while he '

is in school. This means that the
government pays the interest to the
loaning institution. Subsidized
loans may be waived, and if a
school doesn’t provide the finan-
cial costs vs. the financial aid state-
ment subsidized loans won’t be
given.

What you need to tackle the

higher mathematics of a science

or engineering curriculum are
more functions——more func—
tions than a simple slide—rule
calculator has.

Enter the Tl—55-ll, with 112
powerful functions. You can
work faster and more accurate—
ly with theTl—55~ll, because .it’s
preprogrammed to perform
complex calculations ——like de~
finite integrals, linear regression

and hyberbolics- at the touch
of a button. And it can also be
programmed to do repetitive
problems without reentering

 

the entire formula.

Included is the Calculator
Decision«Mal<ing Sourcebook.
It makes the process of using
theTl—55-ll even simpler, and
shows you how to use all the
power of the calculator.

...AND A SEX IBDOK

The Mouse and His Child
by Russell Hoban
Avon Books-$2.95
The neatest thing about The
Mouse and His Child is that it looks
so innocent. The cream cover
with a neat red-checkered
border, the large letters and the
line sketch drawings by Lillian
Hoban bring to mind Charlotte's
, Web, and Stuart Little. But once
Jyopened, once inside, past the
charming Christmas scenes,
and tin wind-ups that speak,
that speak, the reader is
thrown, along with the tin
mouse and his son, into the
cruel world of reality where
everyone learns that the fight
for territory is all, and self-
destiny, along with never giving
up hope, wins them every time.
Told from the point of view of

als, illustrated in cruelty and

80's

THE COSMO REPORT

By Linda I. Wolfe

"Laughs and joy anal lonliness and

more can sex therapists, coun-
selors, surveys, etc., tell us
about it? Glancing at the many
bookshelves crammed full of
pages on the stuff, one has to
wonder what's left to discuss, or
even, who's left to discuss it. Can
The Guests of Merv Griffin Talk

be pretty interesting to find out
what the people in I-looterville

animals that aren't even anim-

violence, this tale is surely an
allegory for something bigger
and better than we.

The story is simple: waking
up one Christmas Season in a
wonderful toy shop filled with
glittering, and wonderful toys,
the mouse child and his father
act quickly told the rules-no
speaking before midnight, and
no crying on the job. Seeing a
wonderful house lit by warm
lights inside and filled with dolls
at dinner and at work who only
speak in snatches of newsprint
because their headsgare made of
paper mache and glue) the
mouse child realizes what he

Douglases never had any
children.) .

Women And Sex In The 80's is a
compilation of statistics
gathered in a survey taken by
Cosmopolitan, that piece of trash
disguised as a magazine and

Gurley-Brown. Keeping this in
mind, it comes as no surprise
that most of the book is excerpts
of readers’ sexual practices-not
just "how often” or "what kind”
but vivid details, and I mean
vivid. Nothing is left to the
imagination.

There are paragraphs upon
pragraphs on how different
women responded to the ques-
tions in the most personal way
possible—by baring all, so to
speak. To get right down to it
(again, so to speak), this book is
real dirty.

But it is (supposedly) a truth-
ful survey, so it's all for the sake
of science,.right? If you're too
embarrassed to buy Truck Stop

Novo Combo, featuring Pittsburgh's own Pete Hewlett, has just
released a second album for Polydor, but scant few copies can be
found in Pittsburgh record stores. This summer, the band played
at a festival in Sweden, where they received an encore but
headliners like Steve Miller and Barbara Mandrell didn't. . . In
the Oakland scene, The Five are still alive and their long-awaited
EP isdue out sometime in late September. The band, who are
i} already at work on new material, will be at Danny's on the 11th
(Dave's birthday is on the 18th, but no one knows how old he'll
be; "17".7.7)....Donnie Iris has been recording all summer at Jer-
ry's in New Brighton and a new LP should hit the "racks early this
fall....There's some confusion over what label has the rights to
the Silencers and which one doesn't, but they're putting down
tracks at Asterix anyway, so perhaps a third effort won't be far
behind....Norm Nardini still lives in Swissvale....one of the tri-
state's rock monuments, the Youngstown Agora, shut its doors
forever this summer. lt will be missed....Beaver Falls’ G-Force,
otherwise known as the Cranati Brothers, have finished some
demos and are currently negotiating for a deal with several
labels....Saw the Clash in the parking lot behind the Stanley;
they pulled up in a station wagon and loked real spiffy in their
lovely suits and bottle-colored hairdos. Urggghh....the backstage
party at the Civic Arena held after the recent]. Geils concert was
over-run with some very young girls, but, not to worry all you
over-18 groupies, the girls were related to some V.l.P. from the
band's record company....Rumor has it that BRUCE (no last

A FANTASY BOOK...

-needs most—a mama and a

home. The elephant who guards
the house and regards it as her
own, seems the perfect mama to
him.

From the warm and cozy toy
shop the mouse and his child
journey to dumps, woods, and
ponds where snapping turtles
muse on things philosophical.
After a crashing accident—the
refugees are thrown into a trash
dump, and made slaves to a
Hitleresque Rat who recruits
old wind-ups for slave labor
gangs.

What follows is a reality of life
and death (Owl's talons sinking

buy this because it's the same
thing. Think I'm pulling your
leg? Try these chapters on for
size: "Turn-Ons and Aggres-
sion," "Lunch Hour Sex," "Oral
Sex," "Coital Sex: Positions,"
"Homosexual Sex," "Sadomaso-
chistic Sex," "Multiple
Orgasms," "Techniques of Mas-
turbation," "Sexual Fantasies
And Dreams," "Threesomes:

I wouldn't advise reading this
on the bus or in the student
lounge, if you know what I
mean. I'd love to print some
excerpts, but I'm afraid the Uni-

sels, armies of warring shrews
that hint down field mice and
imprision them for rations) that
rivals the journey of any hobbit
in search of any ring, and is cer-
tainly more realistic than any-
thing Dorothy and Toto ever
undertook.

It all sounds rather hokey, but
despite a sugared ending that
was clearly out of sync with the
rest of the book (electrocution
would have been better), The
Mouse and His Child is reading on
a level of pure enjoyment; a
work with not too much good
against evil, nor sugar-coated
frosting in the American way. It
isn't like reading Sartre either,
but all in all, it's good fantasy‘
fun with an interesting story
line.

Christine Wiltanger

wouldn't understand.

You have to question this sur-
vey's validity. Somehow I find it
difficult to believe that the
women l've seen reading Cosmo-
politan practice sex in such
bizarre and wild ways. lt seems
odd to think that every woman
in America is like the ones who
filled out this survey-—are we
truly a nation of sex—cra2ed
anything-goes females? Imean,
anyone could have filled out an
application and lied.

But, whatever the case, the
book doesn't cost much and it is
pretty steamy and often funny,

so why not?

Where to begin?

Just try to imagine a scene in
which Scatman Cruthers is rid-
ing along on his bicycle with
Albert Einstein at his side. Sud-
denly, Lawanda Page (you
might remember her as the
bible—slinging Aunt Esther from
Sandford 51 Son) arrives, hot in
pursuit of ’ole Scat. She's chas-
ing him in a chariot that's capa-
ble of hurling whole salamis
, from its carriage. Get it? Nope,
me neither!

Such nonsense can be found
in abundance in Zapped, one of

local college, Joe Flynn. Movies
such as The Professor Who Wore
Tennis Shoes, Flubher, and The
Shaggy Detective, patented the ”lab
accident-strange powers—the
7 adults won't buy it” storyline.
Even more obvious is the now
H ’ familiar power of telekinesis

” which gained considerable pop-

ularity after its splendid perfor-
mance in the DePalma classic
Carrie. The frenzy of the ”night
to remember-telekinetic prom”
is forged right down to the sur-
pentine fire hydrant. Well it is
safe to say’ that at this point,
Zapped had long swallowed any .
pride -it may have had. Parodies 
of Star Trek and The Exorcist fall
flat on their face as do the per-
petual sight gags that hint to the
old Monkee’s series.

Given the success of a recent
”piglette comedy,” it might be
said that audiences have been

”Porky—trained” for this sort of
’ school bus humor but whether
or not the public is hungry for
another flash of back alley ob-
scenity will be determined by ~
the box office. Remember P
though, this sort of movie com-
petes for the same dollar as Pac-
Man and the new T’opp’s
football cards.

MIRAGE
Fleetwood Mac
Warner Bros.

Fleetwood Mac sits pretty
atop the alburn charts thanks to
their latest effort titled Mirage.
It's an album pack full of short-
comings and yet nobody should
be surprised at its success. I for
one look upon Mirage's mass
acceptance as an affirmation
that the adventurous and much
maligned Tusk had to be a better
record than it was given credit
for being. In short, nobody will
suck up a boring/safe album like
the American public!

Fears that Mac would be no
more following the shaky Tusk
tour should not be quickly dis-
posed of because of the release
of Mirage. The solo and some-
what manic flights that Lindsey
Buckingham and Stevie Nicks
took into their little worlds of
the subconscious have caused a
much more subtle breakup that
has left the group's cohesive-
ness and collective identity reel-
ing. In the wake, Mac's three
resident songwriters appear to
be moving, or in the case of
Christine McVie stagnating, in

Pleetwood Mac's Lindsay Buckingham

distinct and inharmonious
directions.

McVie’s writing remains con-
sistent though not much differ-
ent from the material done on
Mac's eponymously titled LP
from 1975. Here she takes

   

credit for ”Hold Me," the
album's first single and cer-
tainly one of its better tunes
thanks to a mix which allows
Mick Fleetwood’s classy percus-
sion room up front. Other

One can't help but feel an
awed sense of respect when
reviewing the contributions
Steve Cropper has made to pop-
ular music. The man has writ-
ten, produced, and played some
true classics; songs like ”Dock of

"In the Midnight Hour.”

How then can he be responsi-

Well, Steve Cropper quite
simply, is no singer. His voice is
not only rough but also weak (or
as the publicity,sheet tries to
disguise it—”low lr.ev.”)

It's a shame because the
album contains some great

material. Cropper covers tunes
such as ”Make You Fall Love
Again,” which Wet Willie did a
nice job on a couple of years
back, and the classic, ”There
Goes My Baby.” Original
Cropper tunes include ”634-
5789,” which he I:o—wrote some
years back with the great Eddie
Floyd and later gave to Wilson
Pickett. Cropper's version is
revved up a bit more than the
original and includes a horn sec-
tion that provides that big, full
sound.

Cropper probably has these
solo albums written into his
contract and, like the nerdy kid
on the block who has a new
baseball, well, you gotta let him
play. Lets hope he just gets tired
and goes back to doing what he
does best.

INNERMISSION
B.E. Taylor Group
Sweet City/MCA

PATIENT: B.E. Taylor Group

SYMPTOMS: Generic rock n’
roll; music sounds like cheap
imitation of someone who has
already gained popularity—-
album is usually produced by
that popular performer; claimed
by many to have great talent
though it never seems to mate-

rialize on album efforts; unnec-
essary use of nightclub manner-
isms usually due to patient’s
contentment to constantly play
suburban nightclubs and shit-
hole bars.
DIAGNOSIS: Western Penn-
sylvania Rock Syndrome— This
seems to be a clear-cut case. The
patient’s lackadaisical attitude
toward originality and keenness
is textbook. Taylor seems tobe
content to grovel in Donnie
Iris’ wastebasket. (See files on
Silencers and Iron City House-
rockers for similar cases.)
TREATMENT: At present, no
cure is ' known. However, a
prominent Career may await in
Pittsburgh radio broadcasting.

Bananarama
London (import)

Bananarama is a three girl

 

    

In Store" and ”Wish You Were
Here" provide some traditional
romanticism via her beautifully
understated and seemingly
effortless vocals.

Meanwhile, Lindsey Buck-
ingham Continues his penchant
for witless, cute and quirky pop
songwriting. ”Can't Go Back,”
"Book of Love," ”Empire State,"
and "Oh, Diane" all bubble and
fizz within their enchantingly
produced arrangements yet
none manage to quench your
thirst. Throughout, Buckingh-
am's forced and at times hiccupy
vocals compound the problem,
leaving the material to sound all
too pretentious.

Lastly there's resident sorcer-
ess Stevie Nicks and her never-
ending tales of the occult. ”So
I'm back to the velvet under-

band from, of course, England,
who you might have heard on
the Bun Boy Three album, spe-
cifically on the Fun Boy hit sin-
gle, "Ain't What You Do.” ”Shy
Boy" is their first hit, currently
at number 11 on the English
charts, and it deserves to be.
Siobhan, Sarah, and Keren are
hip warblers who sound like a
modern girl group with a differ-
ence. ”Shy Boy” is great not
only because the girls can sing
on key, but because they do so in
such a nonchalant, almost dead-
pan manner. But "the flipside,
"Don't Call Us..." is even better,
and instant classic from a band
that we might never hear from
again, as is often. the case with
obscure one/two hit groups. But
maybe they will survive-I hope
so anyway. Oh, yeah, they don't
even sound like the Go-Go's.

"Clapping Song"/"Blame"
The Belle Stars
Stiff U.K. (import)

The Belle Stars, in case you

haven't heard, are a fantastic’

seven piece all girl band from
that other country where they
speak English with funny
accents. They've had quite a few
singles released, all imports, and
a fantastic 45 EP called
”Another Latin Love Song."
Both sides of this, their most
recent release, are superb, as
usual, and typical Belle Stars
stuff, which means a latin-
esque/Salsa beat and instru-
ments to match (lots of horns
and brass) and a fantastic lead
vocalist (don't know who she is)
who puts the punch right where
it belongs. If you have any sense
at all, you'll spend the extra cash
for this import. And, guess
what? The Belle Stars don't
sound anything like the Go-
Go's, either. (Both 45's are
available at Jim's Records in
Bloomfield.)

C THE LEXICON OF LOVE

ABC
Polygraml Mercury

There's a new breed of music
lurking within the twisted

grooves of this album—a sound r
so fresh and chic that its like .

splashing cold aftershave on a
freshly barbered face. Move
over Hall and Oates, Martin Fry
and ABC have found white funk
and it is alive.

from the opening track of
”Show’ Me" to ”Poison Arrow,"
"Tears Are Not Enough,” and
the scintillating "Look of Love"
this album simmers with that
funked up sound so infectiously
used by Parliament, Shalamar,
Rick lames, and their peers,
while at the same time crackling
with an alrntist evasive, swirling
melody so reminiscent of Roxy
Music.

Trevor Horn's production of
The Lexicon of Love is crystal clear
and makes letter perfect use of a
tight horn section, a string sec-
tion, and some master funk bass
guitar by both Brad Lang and
especially Mark Lickley. Proba-
bly themost standout perform-
ance on the album is the vocals
.of Martin Fry. His voice is as
smooth as butterscotch pudding

   

with written lyrics to match.
What more could one ask for?
The Lexicon of Love confirms it—
blue eyed soul's baby brother is
fair-haired funk, and his call let-
ters are ABC. Be alphabetical.

If and when you see this
record in your local record
store, you'll probably be wary of
picking it up if anyone’s watch-
ing you. And then if you're
adventurous enough to get it up

to the counter‘ and into the \

clutches of that cute blue-eyed

salesgirl, then you have only to
be greeted by the curious looks
of your roomates, or worse yet,
your mother, who seem to say,
”You’re not going to play that,
are you?"

In other words, this record
looks nothing short of threaten-
ing, comparable only to what
would be an invitation to a
Medieval funeral. Right up
there in the hardcore ranks of
Fear or The Misfits.

Inside, Stiv Bator and crew
are sounding some kind of apo-
calyptic battle charge with
anthems and lyrics like, "Ya gotta
walk it, man, just like ya talk it/Wear
the uniform of your gang...Be :2 Lord of
The New Church." The band is
compelling, combining at once
neo-punk ‘ fury with sixties
idealism. Imagine the Sex Pis-
tols meeting the Strawberry
Alarm Clock, and you've got
these rock ’n' roll "Lords" whose
songs are finger pointers much

, like the ones on the first Clash

album. They have waged an
attack on the usuals: television
commercialism, political rhe-
toric, institutional religion, etc.

For "example, "Open Your
Eyes" digs underneath the pop-
ular surface to uncover the lies
of the media, "Video games train the
kids for war/Army chic in high
fashion stores." Betcha ya never
thought of it that way. So, ifyou
reach the counter, look hard
into the eyes of the girl with the

. camouflage pants.

Sports  

By scon DELLETT

Football coaches at press confer-
ences are usually deceptive. They
hide the truth about their teams,
tell the writers how bad practice
has been and then pull a sneak
attack. Anyone attending Pitt’s
news conference this past Tuesday
could tell that North Carolina head
coach Dick Crum was hiding
something.

“We made fair progress in the
pre-season," Crum said, adding
that the Tar Heels haven't had
many two-a-day practices since
class began two weeks ago.

Crum downplayed the creden-
tials of Heisman Trophy candidate
Kelvin Bryant, who gained 1,015
yards and scored 18 touchdowns in
only 22 quarters for the Tar Heels
last season.

“Kelvin is hard to categorize,”
Crum said. “He had one good year
and two fair ones because of injur-
ies. If we keep him healthy, he will
have a good senior year.”

To the inevitable comparsion of
Bryant to Georgia’s Herschel
Walker, Crum said, “He isn’t as big
or strong as Hershel.”

But Crum failed to mention that
Bryant can achieve the same
results.

Crum did praise quarterback

Rod Elkins saying, “He gives good
stability to the offense.” ‘

When it came to his thoughts on
the Pitt squad, Crum sounded like
a Golden Panther telling a visitor
the virtues of the team.

“I suppose if you’ve got to play
Pitt, it’s better to open up with
them,” Crum said. “They are a
complete football team.

“From my point of view, there
are no weaknesses. Their passing
game is as good or better than last
year, and -when you have a 1,000-
yard rusher like Bryon Thomas,
your running game can't be too
bad.”

Crum believes the chances of the
loser of Thursday's game going to
the national will remain good.

“I don’t think losing will destroy
the season,” he said. “For both
clubs, there are ten opponents after
Thursday night. It isn’t a make or
break game.”

According to Crum, North
Carolina is ready to commence
action.

“The players are getting tired of
practice,” Crum said. “We have
been laying in the basic offense and
defense and working on funda-
mentals. There wasn’t much sense
in talking about Pittsburgh.”

Also invited to the conference
were members of Pitt’s offensive

 Boaters Practicing For Season

 

By LISA GRENEVICKI

The West_ Penn Conference
Championship and a winning 8-7
season all added up to a successful
I981 season for the Pitt Panther
soccer team.

This weekend the Panthers
travel to Virginia to open the I982
season, hoping to continue their
winning ways.

Pitt head coach Leo Bemis and
his hooters accept the challenge
and believe they have the potential
to be a good team.

“We’re definitely a better team
than last year," said Bemis. “We’re

side, but 'we have theveterans.

The Panthers got off to a quick
6-0, record in 1981, formidable
opponents and the loss of scoring
attack spelled doom for the Pitt
booters.

The Panthers were never really
out of the contest, often losing by
just one or two goals. For this the
steady“ Panther defense gets the
credit, being consistently strong in
keeping the score down.

Basically, that same defense is
back, but with a few changes.
Bemis has switched junior Gerry
Wasson from the front line to the
fullback position.

“I wanted more speed in the
wing“ fullbacks," said Bemis.

"I asson. has quickness and expe-B‘ ‘

‘ ‘ ‘ ‘c‘o‘n‘cm aéd ram 'ei.¢'hm’

rience. That’s where he can‘ help
the club." _.~_
Junior Don Bowen has‘ been
moved from the sweeper position
to center halfback. .
“I wanted to keep size in the mid-
die. so I moved Bowen up and he's
doing a fine job," Bemis said.
Taking over at Bowen's vacant
sweeper position are two talent-ed
freshmen, Robbin Rosenberry
from Carlisle, Pa., and Mike Rus-
sell from Arlington, Va.
“Rosenberry has the best feet on
the team," said Bemis. “He can
kick with either foot and he'll be a
big help at the sweeper position."
The defense is further aided by

Standing 6-5 and weighing 275
pounds, Panther sophomore tackle
Bill Fralic could replace two offen-
sive linemen at most schools. How-
ever, he has found a home with the
Panthers and is a very integral part
of the team's success rate.

Much of the attention and pub-
licity that Fralic could find at most
other schools is offset here at Pitt,
thanks to _the man playing beside
him-—-Jimbo Covert. Still, Fralic is
not resentful.

“I didn’t expect to be nominated
for All-America,” he said. “It takes
a lot of publicity and promotion to
make All—America. You’ve got to
make a name for yourself all
around the country, not just
locally. _ ,

It makes no difference how skill-
ful a quarterback is or how evasive
a running back is, an offensive
game needs solid protection.

“Blocking is usually different in
each play,” Fralic explained.
“Sometimes we’re opening holes
for the running backs, other times
we’re protecting for the pass.”

For most collegiate offensive
lines, blocking for the pass is the
most difficult of all situations.
However, Fralic said that the
Panthers have become accustomed
to the formations because their

offense is so dependentlon the pass-

ing attack. ‘ .

Having a defensive lineman con-
tinually drill his helment into a
tackle’s gut while pass blocking is
neither that exciting nor
invigorating.

Practices can become spiritless
when you are the battered and
unnoticed players on the team.

“There is a certain period where
it becomes’ hard to put 100 percent
into practice,” Fralic said. “Some-
times, it’s hard to play with the
same intensity in practice as you do

AII..I.Al.‘

in :51 ’g‘a"rr‘1?:"sit'u‘a’tio‘ri.'"But intensity

w

in practice is just as important as
anything else in, the game. V

“I try to concentrate on not los-
ing my head during a game situa-
tion,” Fralic said. “There are a lot
of little things you have to think of.
I try- to do what the coaches say. IfI
do, I think I can beat the otheriguy.

From the bleachers it appears
that an offensive lineman’s job
entails little more than acting as a
human barrier. However, as Fralic
explains, the offensive hand is
sometimes quicker than the specta-
tor’s eye. “Both speed and strength
are equally important,” Fralic
said. “You’ve got to have both tobe
good. I guess my strength and size
are my biggest attributes. I'm not
super quick, but I'm quick enough
to get the job done.”

The reason that Fralic, as well as
most other Panther football play-
ers, is so optimistic about this
year's season can be expressed in
one word—experience.

“During camp, I noticed a lot of
improvement between this year's
and last year's. camp. We weren't as
well prepared last year as we are
now. This year it didn’t take as
long to get in good playing shape. I
think we owe it to good coaching
and experience.”

While other coaches are practic-
ing the basic fundamentals and
basic plays, Fralic said the Pan-
thers have the upper hand because
they can pick up right where they
left off last year. And, if you
remember, last year's season was
concluded with a Sugar Bowl win.

“Confidence is the biggest
thing,” stressed Fralic. “We’ve got
to keep our heads on straight and
keep all our thinking on the right
track; that is the most important

‘thing. We definitely have the talent

to be No. I in the country, we just
need the confidence all season
long."

These are the exact. sentiments of-

the services of seniors john Hagen-
buch and Tom Trempus, junior
Nick Wilson and sophomores Jeff
Dunn, Dan Zemanski and Jim
Steele.

Bemis was worried about the
goalkeeper position and tried to
recruit heavily in this area.

This year’s team has four goal- ,,
ies, but only sophomore Dave '
Ghilani returns with goal expe-
rience from last year.

Junior Jay Hirt has the nod to
start in goal for this weekend’s
action. Freshman Dave Torrence
from Arlington, Va., will also see
some action.

This year’s front line is loaded
with talent and Bemis has high
hopes for a strong scoring attack-
something missing at the end of
last season.

Senior Eric Tiedtke returns as
top scorer for the last two years.
Tiedtke was plagued with injuries
last year, but he worked hard over
the summer and looks ready to lead ‘J
the scoring attack. ' «

Bemis said he had hopes of start-
ing junior transfer Matt lingle at
the striker position, but an ankle
injury put Engle down this past
week.

Instead, Bemis will play two
freshmen at striker, Victor Hugo,
another Virginian, and Jesus Man-
isifor from New York City.

“Hugo is a good, big, strong fel-
low,” said Bemis. “He has the
potential to be a very good striker
for us.”

Senior Troy Norton and sopho-
more Sparky Lucke will also be out
to improve Pitt's scoring.

 Fralic A Big Obstacle F

....;..-ii;.

(‘ontinued from p(1ge.s‘('zi(’nteen
coaches and experts throughout
the country—the Panthers have the
talent, but they have to prove it to
themselves. This is one of Fralic’s
primary goals—-to prove that the
Panthers deserve their No. 1 rank-
ing (UPI and AP polls). “I can’t see
why they would put anyone in
front of us,” Fralic candidly
commented.

“Being ranked No. 1 could play
to our disadvantage,” Fralic con-
tinued. “Opp0nents’ coaches will
really push their players, they will
make them play out of their minds
against us.”

Thus, Fralic has finally dis-
proved the theory of the No. 1 jinx-.
It is not the manner in which the
No. 1 team performs, it isthe oppo-
sition's frenzied, unstoppable and
sometimes insane drive to upset the
team in the No. l spot.

Some would consider Fralic's
job to be more crucial than that of
the secret servicemen‘ surrounding
President Reagan. Fralic, "along
with his fellow linemen is respon-
sible for the protection of one of the
most highly acclaimed quarter-
backs in the nat.ion, Dan Marino.

“I don’t let protecting Dan affect
me. I have a job to do, so I just go
out there and do it and don't worry
about anyone getting hurt," Fralic
said. ‘

Fralic's talent and potential
should provide rewards in the
future, but he presently is a wiri-
ning component on the No. 1 team
in -the n;ition.

line, all of whom expressed the
desire to walk on Three Rivers Sta-
dium's turf as soon as possible.

“We’re concentrating on North
Carolina and not worrying about
the rest of the season,” tackle Jim
Covert said. “We take each game
one at a time.” _

“We had a successful camp,"
said guard Ron Sams. “We’re start-
ing to gel now—executing better
and minimizing mistakes.”

Guard Rob Fada only said “Let’s
get the season started.”

Offensive line coach Joe Moore
praised his unit, saying they are
already in Bowl game form.

“They are farther ahead than we
have ever been,” Moore said. “On
pass sets, we are about where‘ we
normally are at the Bowl games.

1 DC fill NEWS, rriaay, DCPICIHDCT .6, 1362

They are the best since I've been at
Pitt.”

Moore respects the talent North
Carolina will bring in on Sept. 9.
and expects the Tar Heels to blitz
against the offensive line.

“This is the toughest game since
I've been here,” Moore said. “They
are going to blitz us. We've got to
expect every one.

“They are going to rush the pass
differently than ever before,”
Moore continued. “I think they're
going to try to beat us outside.”

Moore stressed the importance of
preventing sacks. .

“A sack can fire up a defense,”
Moore said. “Then you've got to
bring them down."

Of course, the surest thing to
bring the Tar Heels down is a
touchdown pass from Marino.

Head coach Foge Fazio is pleased

with his team's selection as the top
team in the nation, but he believes
they must earn the honor.

“It's a great honor to be No. 1,”
Fazio said. “I don't know how it
will be (being No. l), but I want to
enjoy that first game.

Fazio, like Crum, has plenty of
respect for his opposition.

“North Carolina is the toughest
team we'll face,” Fazio said. “They
are physical, and they are not going
to make mistakes. They also have a
damn good defense.”

Fazio said that to rid the team of
costly mistakes was the major
priority at the final scrimmage at
camp.

“I tried to use the final scrim-
mage as a measuring tool," Fazio
said.

Now that camp and talk are over,
it's time for the season to begin.

Choosing Philosophy Over Loyalty

By BARRY ZASLOFF

A friend of mine recently moved
back into his dorm room, and
invited me over to watch a late-
night Pirate game from the West
Coast.

I accepted. After all, ’I had not
seen him during the entire
summer. He is from New York, and
is a diehard Mets fan. Mention

-Yankees and he jumps into a

frenzy. Forget that they are in the
other 1eague—the Yankees are his
worst enemy.

When I walked into his room, I
wasn't greeted with “How was
your summer?” or “Nice to see you
again."

“How could you go against your
own team?" he asked, in a slightly
sarcastic manner. “Especially one
with so much talent.”

He was referring to a recent arti-
cle of mine in which I said that Pitt
will have a difficult time in win-
ning the national championship,
despite what the polls say.

“Aren’t you going to at least
offer me some potato chips or a

drink before you tear into me?” I
asked. “What do you mean, my
team? Pitt is my school’s team.
They may even be Foge Fazio’s
team, or Dan Marino's, but not
mine.” ‘

By now, we had worked our way
to the television, where the game
was in the second inning. The
announcer was running down the
scores of all the major league
gamesxl could tell that Bill was
more interested in finding out the

“Sure I do. I'd like to see Pitt win
a national championship,” I said.
“I just don't think they’re going to
do it. Ican’t write yes if I believe no,
can I?”

We discussed the matter further,
which‘ led to his question: “Will
you root against Pitt for the sake of
your prediction?"

“I’ve been wrong before," I
offered. “I picked Cooney to beat

"No, I won’t root for Pitt to

Goodbye Tiger Paul...

Tiger Paul Auslander, the unof-
ficial (‘heerleader for the Pitt
Panther basketball team for 10
years, has announced that he will
not be returning to cheer at the
I"ield House this season.

Auslander said he made his deci-
sion after he found outthat cheer-
leading coach Karen Agostinella
would be returning.

‘"'*‘v “Really, with the cheerleading
_..i--R coach (Agostinella) back, I
couldn’t return," Auslander said.

“I had to do what I- did."

Auslander and Agostinella had a
run-in at a Panther basketball
game last season when Agostinella
physically held back Auslander
from doing his antics around the
sidelines.

Auslander said he felt the Pitt

said. “I felt it could have done so
much for the program.

“My biggest thrill was during
the 1973-74 season when Pitt went
to the Final 8,” Auslander con-
tinued. “Two members of the
Golden Panthers pitched in some
money to send me to the playoffs.
' “One specific moment I
remember was during the Steel
Bowl that year, when Pitt des-
troyed Duquesne and Florida State,
two pretty good teams. They just
put on a basketball clinic.”

Despite these fond memories,
Auslanider remains melancholy
about his departure from Pitt
athletic scene.

“I’m really sad; it’s an end of an
era,” he said.

Pops retires...
