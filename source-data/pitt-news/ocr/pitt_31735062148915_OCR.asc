it will play for four consecu-
titre nights.

The presentation of this play
will be an innovation in staging
on the Pitt campus. “Bus Stop”
will be an arcna—style perform-
ance.

This type of performance in-
olves the position of the audi-
ence as well as of the actors.
There is no actual stage.
audience surrounds the per-
formers on all four sides, in
such a way that no viewer -is
more than five feet from the
action.

This arrangement will. accord-
ing to Michael McHale the direc-
tor, “. . . create an intimate play
away from the bigness of Foster
Hall.”

The arena—style performance is
copied from the ancient Greek
theatre. It has previously been
presented at the_'Universities of
Washington, Dallas, and others
throughout the country.

As.McHale further points out,
the arena performance will
limit the size of the audience and
therefore necessitate a longer
run. This factor is the main rea-
son why “Bus Stop” begins on
a Wednesday night instead of
on Players‘ customary Thursday
opening. ,

The plot of “Bus Stop” concerns.

four passengers and the driver of
a bus who make their way to a
roadside diner during a blizzard.
There they become involved with
the proprietress, her high school
girl waitress, and the local sheriff.

These changes, it passed,

Council. ‘

This is a constitutional matter
and was presented by Alan Ber-
man‘; Col. ’58, chairman of the
constitutional revision committee.
Berman proposed that represen-
tation in IFC be put on an equal
basis, instead of retaining the pre-
sent system of proportional re-
presentation based on the number
of men in each fraternity.

No Set Delegation ,.

In proposing this new system,
Berman didnot state speciﬁcally
how many delegates each Fra-
ternity would have. This would
be left to the discretion of the
LIFC Executive Committee:

One other suggested change
in this part of the constitution,
Article 3-Section 2, is that each
delegate should have an alter-
nate instead of having only one
alternate for the whole delega-
tion. The entire proposal will be
votedéon at each of the next
two meetings, the requirement
for a; constitutional change.

The revision of the Judicial
Commission , was introduced by
Denis Lichtman, Col. ’59.

Lichtman moved that seats on
the ﬁve-man Commission be
limited to one per fraternity. The
way the Judiciary is set up now
one fraternity may have as many
men as elected on the Commis-
sion. At present two fraternities
have two men each on the board.

Lichtman’s. proposal was not
a criticism’ of the_pres)entV com- .

rnissiondtself, but a 'criticism’ of '

Council were prpposed at last Wednesday’s meeting of IFC.

would result in a new set up

of the Council delegation itself and also in the Judicial Com-

mission. The first, and more important of the two, deals with
fraternity rep r e s e n t a t i o n inb

diciary. This proposed change

was not voted upon, but instead

ta-bled and referred back to the

Judicial Commission for study.

IFC also announced that it is
making plans for an Interfrater-
nity Pledge Council. This new
Council would consist of two
pledges from each fraternity and
would be advised by Ray King,
adviser to IFC, and the IFC
pledgemaster.

Purpose Stated

The purpose of this Pledge
Council is, as stated by King, “to
give pledges a working knowledge
of how an Interfraternity Council
works, and the opportunity to
meet and work with the pledges
of other fraternities.” This Coun-
cil will be set up within the next
two weeks. _

At VVednesday’s meeting, held
at the Theta Chi House, IFC ac-
cepted the challenge presented
them and the other government-
al bodies on campus in the PITT
NEWS in the Oct. 16 issue. This
concerned the problem of
“drinking”‘at football games and
other locations on campus.

IFC is now forming a commit-
tee to investigate the possibilities
of “legali7.ed" drinking on
campus.

It was also announced that a
rushing brochure would be pub-
lished for the Spring semester.
The last such brochure printed by
IFC was in 1955-56. The book
will explain the fraternity system
at—Pitt and will contain informa-
_tion about each of the 19 fra-
*te,rnit,ies. V . t - -

Chancellor

To Address
All Students

The University of Pitts-
burgh holds its ﬁrst Fall Con-
vocation, Tuesday, Oct. 22, at
11 a.m. in the Soldiers’ and
Sailors’ Memorial Hall. This
convocation will be the first

of two major academic convoca-
tions this year.

Every full time student in the’

University, unde1‘gi'aduate, gradu-
ate and professional is invited to
attend.

Dr. Charles Peake, assistant
chancellor in charge of student
affairs. said, “The Fall Convo-
cation marks the opening of the
academic year at Pitt: The pro-
fessional of the faculty in their
colorful academig robes is part,
of the centuries-old tradition of
universities and colleges
throughout the world. It serves
to remind us that we at the
University are members of one
of the great institutions of_ civil-
ization.”

The Chancellor, (Dr. Edward
Litchﬁeld) has been asked to be
the speaker for this occasion. Last
Spring he delivered his Inaugural
Address chiefly to representatives
of other universities, to trustees,
idCU_1'Ey, and Special guests. It was
obviously not possible at that time
to include the whole student body.
Therefore at the Fall Convocation,
Chancellor Litchﬁeld will present
to students the ideas and plans
he has for the future of the Uni-
versity.”

The faculty will assemble in
the Commons Room at 10:45 a.m.

V At 11 a.m. the faculty will leave

in procession for the Soldiers’ and

.Sailors’ Memorial Hall. All class-

es will be dismissed at 10:40 a_m_
1“ time 1'01‘ the convocation. All
classes will resume at 1 pm,

The secorid academic convoca-
tion will be The Honors Convo-
cation to be held April 16, 1958.
The program to be presented will
be announced later.

John Holmes Toe G

Well-Known Poet
Reads Own Work

John Holmes, a poet listed
in “Who’s Who,” will be the
guest speaker at two Univer-
sity functions this Thursday.

At the noon-day series pre-

sentation in Stephen Foster

Memorial Auditorium, he will dis-
cuss “Eleven Ways to Look at
People.” From eleven of his own
poems he will read descriptions of
individuals in an attempt to show
the portrait making as well as
the aesthetic qualities of poetry.
Later in the afternoon, at 3
p.m. in the Main Lounge of the
Student Union, Mr. Holmes will
present selections from his po-
etry as a guest of the Poetry,
Group. A tea and reception will
follow in order to give stu-
dents and faculty members an
opportunity to meet and talk
with the speaker.

About the mid—ds.y series selec- V

tions, the poet says, that he plans
to “speak of the ways in which
the poems catch and hold percep-
tions and likenesses of human be-
ings. The poems I will read will
include portraits of writers, of
children, of men and women, seen
at particular high moments. I feel
that this sort of poem will be ob-
jective enough so that hearers can
also see it.”

Among the portraits he will
include that of his close friend,
Charles. Connick, who designed
the windows of Heinz Chapel.
According to Dr. Jack Kolbert,
co-chairman of the poetry
Group, Mr. Holmes has a spe-
cial aﬁection for Pitt because it
is the home of his friend’s most
beautiful work, the stained glass
windows of the chapel.

He went on to describe the vis-
itor as “0ne~of the leading poets
in the" world today and an out-
standing interpreter of poetic art.”
He added that a display case con-
cerning the poet and his work will
be shown at .the Belleﬁeld en-
trance to the Cathedral.

John Holmes received his de-
gree of bachelor of science at
Tufts College in Massachusetts
in 1929 and did post-graduate
work at Harvard in 1929 and
I930. He was an instructor in
English at Lafayette College
from 1930 until 1932. He then»
returned to Tufts where he is
now an associate professor in

  University Offerings

Our school was privileged this past week to have one
of the best Collegiate Choirs in Europe, if not in the world,
visit it. This is one of the aspects of an education which
carries over into adult life. This is the intangible, once en-
joyed, forever‘ remembered with a feeling of satisfaction.

The attendance at the Midday Series program of the

‘ Munster Choir was gratifyingly large. This is, of course, the

ultimate justiﬁcation for these cultural meetings. The Uni-
versity expends both time and money in order to present
the finest for our student body.

The appreciation of things comes only from allowing
ourselves“‘to be introduced to them. Those of us who do not
participate are losing what should be an integral part of
the collegiate program, one as important as the curricular
program. A

The fact that the University of Pittsburgh is bringing
renowned individuals and groups to the campus is indica-
tive of the spirit of reappraisal of existing institutions and
the establishment of new ones. A 0

Particularly in the exchange of cultural gifts from one
nation to another as demonstrated in the exemplary Mun-
ster Choir, can our University improve its program and can
human relations be fostered.

Any of our students who were able to mingle ‘with the
German students realize the opportunities for a greater
insight into the problems of the .world today. They could
frankly discuss‘ with one another the gripping common
problems of the East-West struggle. Viewpoints could be
compared and appreciated.

This is the road to the true educational experience, the
development of the total man. He is not one, familiar only
with what he has read and _absorbed in classroom and text
study. He is an individual with a broad outlook, an open
and fertile mind, at ease at social gatherings, and able to
enter into intelligent discussion on a variety of topics. This
is what our University offers us. -Let’s accept the offer.

New Look In The ‘Underworld’ . .

White - Collar Crime

By Carolyn Stasenko

Thanks to newspapers, TV and movies, the
average Joe these days doesn’t have much chance
to forget the fact that he’s surrounded by a world
of crime. In spite of all the reports of crime, though
-—fact or ﬁction——Mr. Joe rarely, if ever, imagines
the criminal world as closely associated with him-
self.

Whatever his mental picture of underhanded
dealings, it is, in all probability, a mistaken one——
one stereotyped by these very it .  .
television‘ shows, news stories
and motion pictures. His first
thought of crime may be a pic-
ture of the dynamic Mark Saber
of London tackling a criminal to
bring the culprit cowering at
the feet of the victorious Saber.
Or it may be one of teenage
hoodlums ganging up on the beat ‘j
policeman, ~ 0 ..

.Well, nowadays, it just ain‘t 3
so. There’s a new trendpin 
crime these days, and the standard, spectacular,
shocking, “obvious” crimes are just plain “old-
fashioned.” According to Frank Gibney’s re-
cent report on “Crime in‘ the U.S.” in Life maga_
zine, this is the age of the subtle crooks—-—the white-
collar crooks, who,-in their everyday affairs, chise1
and swindle billions of dollars—consciously or un-
consciously.

The late Professor Edwin H. Sutherland deﬁned
white-collar crime as a “crime committed by a per-
son of relatively high and respected social stand-
mg in the conduct of his business.” Well, Mr.
Average Joe may be aware that these under-the-
surface chiselers exist. But, chances are, he doesn’t

  

really consider them very dangerous.
Secret of Success

And this is the secret of success for the white-
collar criminal. Violence in crime is deﬁnitely
frowned upon by society. But there is an almost
secret admiration-human nature being what it is—-
for the crook who “cheats with a flair and never
gets caught.”

What really makes’ this type of crook so dan-
gerous is that he often commits the crimes uncon-
sciously—or, at least, he thinks of them as part of
“legitimate business activity.” .

Gibney, in discussing the white-collar crook,
cites examples of the respectable businessman who,
for example, without really thinking of himself as
acriminal, distorts repair and depreciation costs’
on rental property he owns inﬁling his income tax .
return-a crime which is punishable, by the way,
with a $10,000 fine and/or ﬁve years in jail!
Casual Violation ’

And this businessman certainly sees nothing
wrong in taking his wife out to dinner on the com-
pany tab (punishable by a $500 fine and/or one
year in jail). Undoubtedly the reason behind this
casual violation of honesty lies in the set-up of
business itself. Business, today, is impersonal. The
bigger the business, the more impersonal it be-
comes. One generally might be bothered by the
idea of cheating another person, but cheating a
business—an impersonal, distant object——doesn’t
seem to hit the conscience.

Honesty is still admired, to be sure; but it seems
to be part of another age‘. The old standards of
honesty have been rationalized away by the mind

of modern man. Guess Mr. Joe had better break\,s:"

away from the TV long enough to look around and if

 
 

Justifiable Student Protest . . .

Signs Keep Campus Unclean

By Donna Considine

Student protest against the
“Let’s Keep Our Campus Clean”
.signs has recently taken two
forms —— constructive and de-
structive.

The constructive kind took
form in a few
letters to the
editor. Unfor-

t u n a t e l y, it
seems to have
stopped there.

Evidences of
the latter type
can be seen in
the exact areas
of th e signs V
themselves. It
is quite obvious
that the empty
cigarette packs scattered here and
there about the lawn were placed
there purposely by irate students.

We might assume that such a
form of protest is intended to say
what themstudents have been re-
iterating since the start of the
semester. There was deﬁnitely no
need for these signs neither in
past years nor at present. In fact,
they have presented the biggest
litter problem on campus outside
the Tuck Shop.
What Purpose This?

We wonder what was the pur-
pose of the signs since, as I said,
we had no need of them and since

 

they are the objects which con-
tribute to cluttering the grass.

I can think of no other campus
which is forced to beseech its stu-
dents to respect the grounds. Of
course, I haven’t visited that
many, but if we are to become
like Yale, Harvard, Princeton.
etc., let’s assume the dignity of
these institutions with their long-
standing traditions. After all, the
University of Pittsburgh has a
long history, too.

I seriously doubt that visitors
can be well impressed with the
signs. They will conclude that the
University family is prone to
throwing rubbish ‘about. More-
over, the signs hardly enhance
the beauty of our unique Gothic
buildings. What will the alumni
think when they return to their
Alma Mater at Homecoming?

Far-Reaching Reputation

We have a far-reaching repu-
tation as a University without a

‘campus to the extent that count-

less people believe that the Cath-
edral of Learning is our only
building. (I’ve spent several sum-
mers dispelling these rumors in
the East.)

Actually, we do have such a
small plot of grassy ground in
comparison to the more campus-
type school. Therefore, it’s a
shame that the numerous “clean

at least recognize the “new look in crime.”

campusads” make our small plot
look even smaller.

In spite of all the harm_ which
they do, however, we cannot con-
done the destructive form of stu-
dent protest, at least not until all

the constructive means have been

exhausted. So far the students
have written letters to the Pitt
News. We can print them; we can

 

write editorials and columns, butf. A

we are only the voice of Uni-
versity—wide opinion. We can
never be a. substitute for group
action.

Individual students can do little
to improve the situation. They‘
would need a responsible group
such as Student Congressito act
as their spokesmen.‘ Being the
elected representatives of the stu-
dent body, SC is the logical or-
ganization to handle it. Because
of their positions these student
leaders would have a. better
means than anyone else of find-
ing out who ordered the signs put
up, why, and if ‘they can do any-
thing about having them remov-
ed. -

I suggest such a measure in
place of having individual stu-
dents complaining, defacing the
signs, and littering the lawn. Only
by acting as adults will we be
treated so. As the current saying
goes, “Let’s get on the stick,
gang!” ~ '

Letters To _The Editor

Editor: ~

Despite your eloquent attempt
to defend the administration’s un-
dermining of the Tuck Shop. I
believe that there is no other pur-
pose behind this policy short of
another attempt to stiﬂe individ-
ualism at Pitt.

The administration does not
have the right to tell the student
what to do with his spare time,
and any attempt to dictate in this
direction is. a step toward tyran-
ny.“ I have nothing against the
cafeteria or Hunt and Pine
Roomsfbut surely the fallacies of
an attempt to force those accus-
tomed to the Tuck Shop into con-
gregating at the Union instead
are clear. For one thing, our in-
adequate food facilities are al-
ready overworked, and curtail-
ment of the Tuck Shop would
only cause that much more frantic
scurrying for a meager bite to eat.
_ Besides, who wants to be fore-
’    

  

cup of coffee between classes?
Traditionally fraternities and so-
rorities occupy certain booths.
Any Greek_will tell you this sys-
tem is invaluable for not only
developing spirit within the

group, but in fostering individ-.

uality among the fraternities.
Rather than spend so much
time trying to drive Tuck Shop-
pers . away, the administration
would win far more support if
they would attempt to improve
the pathetically poor service in
the Shop. We are starting to won-
der just what kind of tie-up the
administration has with the Oak-
land area restauranters. After all,
the evidence is piling up.

when the University has provided
us, the students, with a cafeteria

can be stopped.

However, in my opinion, thex

Tuck Shop is not the only place
that should be closed. It is a dis.
grace to the University to have
such a thing as the cafeteria in the
Cathedral basement still open.
Why keep open such a_ ‘dismal
place? True, the Tuck Shop is a
dismal enough place to have to
eat; but that basement cafeteria is
much worse.

When a visitor comes to the
University and is shown the Stu-
dent Union cafeteria, he is very
impressed. But how can anyone
expect him to keep that impression
after he sees the Tuck Shop and
especially the “dark hole” in the

Present Position Is
Preparation For
School Admittance

The new face behind the
lending desk in the ﬁfth ﬂoor
library belongs to Miss Mar-
garet Allen. Miss Allen’s
home is Edinburgh, Scotland.
She will be at Pitt for one
year. This is her first library
‘work, and her ﬁrst time in the

‘“ 1 United States.

Miss Allen was’ born and lived
in Edinburgh where she recently
received a degree at the Uni-
versity. She lived with her pa-
rents and a younger sister who is
a nurse.

She is now working in the
Lending Dept. where she is get-
ting experience so that she may
attend a school of librarianship
in London. She arrived in Pitts-
burgh on Oct. 7, 1957.

When she first arrived in Pitts-

‘ burgh Miss Allen admits that she

felt alone and lost, but in less
than twd weeks she is beginning
td feel more at home. People have
"been kind and helpful to her and

she is ﬁnding it easier to get

around. ‘

- Edinburgh, being smaller, and
her home since birth was easier
to get around in. The transpor-
tation tieup in Pittsburgh hasn't
aided in getting her settled. She
is living at the YWCA in East
Liberty.

Students at Pitt seem pretty
much like students anywhere else
when viewed over the lending
desk but Miss Allen hopes to get
acquainted with the students dur-
ing her time here. She would also
‘like to see more of the U.S. She
hopes to start seeing America by

One of the librarians in Edin-

A My name is Cornell Jackson,
private eye. Two days ago I
was sitting in my office dic-

blonde passed my window. I
knew she was tall because my
oﬂlce is on the tenth ﬂoor.

“Hello,” she said, “I need
help, Rutgers.”

“The name’s Cornell.”

“Yes. I'm worried about my
husband. Every night he stays
out till six in the morning. He
comes home with his hair
mussed, lipstick all over his
face. What’s up?” '

"The butler did it.”

“Oh come, come, Yale.”

"Cornell, dearie.”

is unfaithful.”

I exercised my think—t.ank.

CLOTHES MAKE THE BMOC

Last week we passed along some fashion hints for
coeds. Today we will do the same for college men.

The most important thing to remember, gentlemen,
is to dress with verve, with dash, with inventiveness.
Don’t be imprisoned by the traditional conservatism
of men’s clothing. Brighten up your appearance with
a single earring, or a cavalry saber, or a gold derby.

 

However, guard against gaudiness. If, for instance,

you are wearing a gold derby, do not also _wear a cavalry V
saber. This is too much._Wear a dagger instead, or,,for
, formal occasions, a bowie knife. « . ’

Let us turn now to a persistent rumor that a gar-
ment called the “suit” is on the verge of making, a
comeback. Some of you older students may remember
this “suit.” It was an ensemble consisting of a jacket
and trousers, both of which——this’ll kill you—both of
which were made out of the same material!

The last “suit” ever seen on an American campus
was in 1941-—and I ought to know because I was
wearing it. I was an undergraduate then, and in love
——hopelessly in love with a beauteous statistics major
named Harry Sigafoos. (She is one of the two girls I
have ever known named Harry. The other one is her
sister.)

I loved Harry madly, though her expensive tastes
were the ruin of me. Bit by bit I sold off my belong-
ings to pursue this costly courtship—-first my books,
then my clothes, until ﬁnally I was left with nothing
to wear but,a “suit”. One night Icame calling for her
in this garment and she, of course, slashed me across
the face with a riding crop and sent me from her door.

I. slunk home and lit a Marlboro and sat down to
think. I always light a Marlboro when I sit down to
think, for their good mild ﬂavor is a great aid to cere-
bration. I always light a Marlboro when I don’t sit
down to think, too, because Marlboro is my favorite
cigarette, and I know it,_will be yours, too, once you
make the acquaintance of that ﬁlter, that ﬂavor, that
ﬂiptop box. As the man says, you get a lot to like with

- a Marlboro. _
Well, sirs, smoking and thinking thus, my eye hap-

pened to fall on an ad in a campus newspaper which

said: “WIN A COMPLETE WARDROBE! Touhy’s -

Toggery, the campus’s leading men’s store, announces
a contest to pick the best-dressed man on campus. The
winner will receive absolutely free a complete new
wardrobe!” .

Struck by a sudden inspiration, I took pen in hand
and wrote a letter to lVIr. Touhy of Touhy’s Toggery:

“Sir—I see by the paper that you are giving a com-
plete new-wardrobe to the best-dressed man on cam-
pus. What a ridiculous idea!

“Obviously, to be the best-dressed man on campus,
you must ﬁrst have a lot of clothes, and if you have a
lot of clothes, what do you need with another wardrobe?

“Touhy’s Toggery should give a new wardrobe to
the worst-dressed man on campus. Me, for instance.
I am an eyesore. There isn’t a crow in town that will
come near me. Three times this monththe Salvation
Army salvage truck has picked me up. Esquire has
canceled my subscription. .

“I submit that a vote for me is a vote for reason, a
vote for equity, a vote for the American way !”

With a ﬂourish I signed the letter and sent it off,
somehow feeling certain that very soon“ I would be
wearing a complete new wardrobe.

And I was right——because two weeks later I was

Gridders Have Drive
Necessary For Wins

'By,JANICE KLEIN ,

Ask Charlie Brueckman about his greatest thrill in col-
lege and he will say without hesitation, “playing football for
Pitt.” Chuck, who is on the candidate list of almost every
All-American team in the country, is one of the Panther’s
most enthusiastic players. If he had his choice, he would
rather “see the team win all of their remaining games than

be Al1—American.”

Not that being All-American
doesn’t mean anything to him, in
fact “it would be the greatest
honor in his life.” But Charlie is
the kind of guy who would rather
sacriﬁce personal distinction for
the team’s glory.

He says, “This year’s squad has
more morale and team spirit than
any Pitt team he has played with.
Every man on the team is willing
to work, and they have the deter-
mination that makes for a good
team.

Plays Baseball

The husky boy from Stowe
Township has been acquainted
with football a long time. His fa-
ther played in his day, and he
started Chuck practicing at an
early age. At Stowe High, he was
an outstanding player, and became
well known for his work at the
end position.

Football is not the only sport
in which he excells. Charlie is
also an excellent baseball play-
er. He was spotted by the Pi-
rates, and tried out for the team,
but the dream oi,’-;«..l)a.seball was
set aside for a. college education.
He is now a senior in the school
of Busin ess Administration.
When he graduates in February.
the Army lays first claim to
him for six months. Then will
he play pro-ball? Says Charlie,

."T,hat’sla bridge I’ll cross when V

O

I come to it.”

The eighth ﬂoor of Schenley
House is the place the Panther co-
captain calls home during the
school year. Dick Bowen, Pitt's
ace fullback, who rooms with
Cl{arlie,.considers him a great guy
and the best center in the coun-
try. Both are members of the

,“'famed” Panther Club.

Likes Hunting

Chuckis social life does not re-
volve around one girl, yet he has
his qualifications. They are: sweet,
down to earth, and unspoiled. He
likes to dance, and popular music
rates highest with him. His favor-
ite singer is Doris Day. When he
goes to movies, musicals are what
he enjoys the most.

Charlie ﬁnds hunting an ideal
way to relax, and he tries to
get out into the ﬁelds as much
as possible. Needless to say. he
builds up a his appetite no mat- '
ter what he does. Steak and
spaghetti (a lot of it) are the
foods that appease his appetite
most. He thinks the food at Pitt
is good, but they would have to
go along way to beat his moth-
er’s cooking.

Those who have seen Charlie in

action can well agree with Sports
Illustrated when they list him as

“the best pivot man in the East-” .

Anderson Ably Leads Black Knights
For Top Lambert Trophy Selection

By DAVID BREAKSTONE
An ever-alert Army football team clipped the Panthers
29-13 on Saturday, at West Point. The Black Knights of the
Hudson, tied at the half 6-6, stormed back in the ﬁnal two
quarters to tally 23 points and choke off any local hopes for

a victory.
The Cadets, coached by

EarlBlaik, moved for three

touchdowns on the ground, an-9 »

other via a pass, and added a long
ﬁeld goal for a ﬁnal ﬂair.

Sophomore Bob Aanderson, a
very shifty runner from the mid-
lands of Florida, counted the ﬁrst
and last touchdowns or the Black
Knights and was the game’s lead-
ing ground gainer with 96 yards
in 20 carries.

Walters Scores

Cadets Pete Dawkins, Harry
Walters, and Maurice Hilliard ac-
counted for the other Army mark-
ers. Skyscraper End Dick Scher-
er and Halfback Dick Haley_scor—
ed for the locals on the money end
of long passes by Quarterback
Ivan Toncic.

The Knights marched 83
83 yards in sixteen plays mid-
way in the third period to be-
gin in opening a wide scoring
gap. Fullbacks Vince Barta, and
Walters combined with the
adroit Anderson to tear off con-
sistently good gains. Walters

took it in from the two yard
line and Hilliard converted. The
score stood 13-6.

Panther Dick Bowen threw a
pass, after taking a Toncic hand-
oﬂ’, which Anderson picked off for
an interception. In six lightning-
quick plays, the Long Grey Line
had tallied again. The pay-off
was a Dave Bourland to Pete
Dawkins aerial which covered 32
yards and scored six points. Wal-
ters kicked the point and the lead
was stretched to 13 points with 3
minutes gone in the fourth stanza.

Hilliard Tries Field Goal

The Blue and Gold took the
kick off and moved to their own
43 before lightning struck them
down a second time. Haley moved
out on a swing pass play, took
the handoff, and threw for his end
down the ﬁeld. His luck was no
better than Bowen’s as Anderson
darted in and took the ball for his
second interception. I

Army's methodical mower
slowed down perceptibly at this
point. The Military, conse-
quently, went for a three-point-
er which Hilliard bagged from
the twenty yard line. The score

.was now 23-6 and the hand-
writing was painfully evident
on the Panther wall.

Toncic, the sophomore signal
caller from Midland, did not hesi-
tate to throw as soon as his mates
received the Knights’ kickoﬁ. He
tossed a ﬂoater to Scherer for 24
yards. After being nailed for a six
yard loss, Toncic ﬂipped a bullet
to Haley on the Cadet 20 and he
raced the remaining distance un-
molested.

Toncic only put “half a shoe"
into the kickoff and Dick Scherer
recovered the onside boot at the
Army 46. The Jungle Cat joy was
jolted rather speedily as tough
Cadet guard Stan Slater inter-

cepted another Haley swing pass

and rambled 50 yards down to the
Pitt 17. Walters barreled to the
four.

Artful Anderson ﬁnished the
job from there to complete the
Army attack on the scoring col-
umn. Walters added the point and
the scoreboard showed 29-13.

, Notre Dame Tilt
To Decide Future

By ED KOLTISKA
Sports Editor

Now that the Panthers have proven that Army has the best

team in the East, all they have to do is worry about bringing in a
winning record before the season is over. The rest of the schedule
will be twice as tough now that the Cadets have disorganized the
Panther eleven.
, The Panthers still in contention after the ﬁrst half gun just
about gave the game away in the second half. Army had to work
only for two touchdowns. The ﬁrst one which came after a 68 ‘yard
drive and the second one in the third quarter that went 83 yards on
,17 plays.

The rest of the scoring for Army came on pass interceptions
by Anderson and Stanley Slater. Anderson's interceptions were
turned in for a touchdown and a ﬁeldgoal while Slater’s grab was
turned into a touchdown that tied up the game for Army.

In the third period, Army showed a drive of power that would
have knocked out any team. They ran right through the center of
the Panther line for ﬁve and eight yards a carry to score after sev-
enteen straight running plays. By the end of the third period, the
Panther eleven were a tired bunch. Till then there were only two
subtstitutions. Toncic and Bob Stark were the only substitutes.’ Then
in~the third period, Coach John Michelosen ﬁnally sent in Ed Michaels
to replace John Guzik in the line.

All this time, Earl Blaik was substituting in his line in pairs.
Two guards would go in and then‘ two tackles and ends. By the third
period, Army was as fresh as the first stanza.

‘Midway in the ﬁnal quarter, it seemed as if the Panthers were
in a comeback stage as they scored a touchdown on a Toncic to
Dick Haley pass. Then Toncic tried an onside kick that Scherer

recovered which~would have en-
abled the Jungle Cats to stay in
the game if capitalized on. But the
situation was taken in hand as
Bowen tried to pass and the.Ca-

With only‘ seven minutes re-
maining, fans were starting to
pour out of the stadium with dis-
appointed looks on their faces.
The Notre Dame game is the Must
game for the Panthers now. This
will determine whether or not the
Panthers can finish with a good
record or just break.

After Notre Dame the locals
will meet Syracuse, West Virginia,
Penn State, and Miami. All tough
ones for a team that may lack
conﬁdence. Syracuse is still un-
beaten while the Mountaineers
and Lions have both bit the dust,
along with Miami. If the Panthers
can take the Irish, they can get
their conﬁdence back to take the
measure of the remaining games,
but they also must take advantage
of their scoring opportunities.

Injuries Hamper Frosh

By LARRY HAGGERTY

“With more guards and tackles turning out for our prac-
tice sessions, I think I will be able to ﬁeld a very respectable
football team,” stated Coach Steve Petro.

Ever since 1953 the quality of the Pitt yearlings has been
going downhill. The personnel gets better each season, but in-
juries along with sickness seem to cut the squad in half.

This season, for instance, .
found a large group of future

stars turning out fo- practice. date have been Bobby LaRue,
But With the Asian ﬁll and Charles Reinhold, Fred Cox, Bob

men, the team will be lucky to
even show up for their games.

If the line is able to do their
share of the work, the team. is
very likely to win most of its
games. The squad is certain to
better last year’s record of one
tie and three defeats.

The backﬁeld is shaping up
quite well. John Sakal is handling
the quarterback position. His fa-
vorite pass receivers are Mike
Ditka, Ron Delﬁne, and Steve

Boggs, and Ray Tarasi.

Due to the shortage of linemen,
Coach _Petro has been unable to
hold a full scale scrimmage. ,
