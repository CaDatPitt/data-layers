and Professor Hovey,
acting head of the ﬁne arts depart-

‘amateurish’ and was “really sur-
prised how professional-like it really
is.”

“The shoW,is an unusually ﬁne ex-
hibit of photographs,” according to Dr.
Spencer. -“Not only is unusually good
technique used, but picture composi-
tion is exceptional.”-

War Department  

Transfers Cullen A

 

Military Department Head Given
Command Of ‘Fort Wright

Lieutena.nt-Colonel Edward J. Cul-
len, head of the military faculty, has
just received orders from the War
department to report to, and to take
command of, Fort Vvright, New York,
a.t the expiration of this school year.

During his tenure at the University,
the Colonel built up the band from
an 80-piece .outﬁt to a well organized
unit of 150 pieces.

Pitt Rifles and Scabbard’ and Blade
have been built up during the six
years of Colonel Cullen’s administra-
tion here.

Among the awards the University
has received during the Colonel’s
stay, are distinguished institution
certiﬁcates which place the Univer-
sity among the higher ROTC corps.

The United States Marine corps
this week offered a second lieutenant-
ship without examination to any man
selected by the military department.

Last night, at 7:30 o’clock a testi-
monial dinner in honor of Colonel
Cullen was held at the Blue Room of
the ‘William Penn hotel. It was given
by the advance course students of the
University ROTC corps. George Roll,
cadet colonel, presided. The Colonel
was presented with a sterling silver
cigarette case, ap-propriately inscribed
by the cadet corps. Other speakers,
in addition to Roll, were, Howard
Husband, captain of Scabbard a11d
Blade, and Major E, J. Turner, unit
instructor for the coast artillery units.

Assembly To Fill
SFA Executive
Positions Tonight

Six Students Will Be Elected
At Joint Dinner Meeting
For Old, New Groups

Six student members of the 1935-36
Executive committee of the SFA will
be elected at a dinner meeting of the
group tonight.

At a joint session in the Cathedral
Mansions, the incoming body and the
expiring organization will hear Leon-
ard Marks, C35, chairman, review the
first year's work of the student-faculty
assembly. Election of the new Ex-
ecutives will follow.

For the past several weeks, candi-

dates for the committee posts have
been ‘lining up and bartering votes.
Just what alignments will be noted
tonight few appear to know. Indepen-
dents, claiming at lea.st 12 “unaffiliat-
ed” members, plan to run one senior
and one junior man, and one senior
woman.
Should the independent slate wav-
er, several fraternity coalitions are
ready to step‘ in. ‘Whether the frater-
nities‘ (now in two factions) will ob-
tain three, four or ﬁve seats depends
upon several factors. Most observers,
however, predict an equal division be-
tween fraternity and non-fraternity
camps-.

Under the new SFA constitutional
amendments, the membership in the
directing committee has been increas-
ed by one, and proportional repre-
sentation for women assures two wo-
men members. At least four of the
six executives must be seniors.

Among the problems facing the new
Assembly is that of the tie between
Betty Rieger and Virginia Boyd. Each
women received 150 votes in the April
26 balloting. The occupancy of the
ﬁfth junior wo1nan’s seat is therefore
undecided,

No other business is scheduled ex-
cept for the election. solution of the
tie, and Marks’ valedictory. The chair-
man’s report will include a review of
the weekly Executive body meetings,
the monthly Assembly sessions, and
the new projects supervised‘ by SFA.

Don And Helen Lead Again

Tonight At

* Seniors’ Ball

 

 

Here’s Don Campbell

And, Lo, Helen Milliron

“No, I’m not going to the Senior Ball,” said a young BusAd freshman to
Don Campbell, C35, chairman of tonight’s dance, when Don was doing a bit
of ticket-selling about school. “I read that the Senior Ball is only for seniors,
and, gosh, I’m no senior,” the youth continued.

The young BusAd freshman, however, is really going to the affair to-

night.

Chairman Don had ﬁnally convinced him that, although the Ban is

primarily for seniors, and although the big goal of the committee is to have,

Keep Moving Mentally, Don’t

F ossilize, Warns* Critic Seibel

 

“The world of today is run by peo-
ple of my age, and it has a. reluctance
to be made over . . . especially over-
night,” said George Seibel, literary
and dramatic critic of the Pittsburgh
Sun-Telegraph, before. Inquiry forum
Wednesday,

But Mr. Seibel does not hold an old
man’s view of the‘ world. At the be-
ginning of his talk he stressed the
fact that in outlook he is “as young
as you people here today.”

_“The whole world,” Mr. Seibel con-
tinued, “wants to go somewhere to-
day and it wants to get there fast.
This seems to me to be a fundamental
mistake.

“Important changes take place so
slowly that no one knows at the time
that they are taking place. In the

United States these changes will be
here before we are aware of them.”
. People themselves, Mr. Seibel be-
lieves. are not necessarily inimical to
change. “The only difference be-
tween the socialist and the ordinary
man is that the socialist wants to
label everything,” he remarked.

“The great thing,” Mr. Seibel said,
“is always to keep moving mentally.
Let’s not become ossiﬁed or fossilized.

Let us remain ﬂuid in our thinking.»

A closed skull is dangerous.

“I want to be always young myself
and ‘always to meet people who have
opinions different from my own.

“The young person who uses
‘caution with courage’,” Mr. Seibel
concluded, “will keep moving from
one beautiful mountaintop to another.”

of all classes are, as usual, cordially
invited.

The Ball starts at 10 o’clock, Pitts-

Debaters Capture
Sp rin g Carnival
Sideshow Prize
Kappa Sig Trackmen Run Away

With Interfraternity Meet;
Wood Gets Three Firsts

!

By Marjorie M. Reich

The sun did shine. The people did
come. \Vhat’s more they stayed, the
whole 350 of them, and left the Sta-
dium with coats of tan, sundry
“platinoid pins,” colored canes, and
at least a hazy idea of what a Spring
Festival Carnival might be.

For three weeks and more, vague
rumorings of a Carnival have been
heard surreptitiously on Alumni hall
landings and publication offices. And
then it rained. And it kept on raining
till there was a track meet. And then
it rained some more. And then the
sun came out and those men and wo-
men with a sense of curiosity, and
an eye on the loving cups found them-
selves in the Stadium on Wednesday.

Tlieywere neither disappointed nor
disheartened but stayed and had the
time of their lives.

They ﬂocked to the “Debatin’ Side
Show” gazed" open-mouthed at the
bearded woman (Marguerite Swank),
marveled at the vocal propensities" of
the‘ barker (Frank fDoeringer), got
free souvenirs of platinum pins and
cigaret» lighters (straight pins and
matches), took a chance on a number,
and those that hit the right ones will
be tuningup the old victrolas so as
to hear their voice recordings offered
as prizes, _

Booth judges N. Robert Seidle, as-
sistant to the dean of men, and Carl
Cass, director of Pitt Players, award-
ed the bronze loving cup to the Men's
and ‘Women’s Debating Associations
for this “marvellllous, stupppendous
side show.”

Between everything else men and
women overflowed the bingo pavilion
which was SFA’s Carnival contribu-
tion. For one penny they tried their
luck at the colored canes which were
offered to the victorious. It may have
-been Gene Burkhart in the convincing
role of announcer, or Roberta Nern’s
smile, but before the afternoon was
over, many were twirling red_. blue.

will raffle oif the remainder of the
canes to all those who bid ﬁve cents

It was Dr. Twerp‘s Museum that
brought the laughs into the Stadium.
Charles Ruch, Panther Ed, arranged

tea tax was reproduced with thumb
tacks on a bed of tea lea.ves, or the
ruins of China were but a broken sau-
cer. Many marvels were shown for
the ﬁrst time. The four seasons were
represented by salt, pepper, cloves

his torn shoe to represent himself

Ruch’s back yard scrapings in a china

Invitations to Chancellor John G.
Bowman's reception for graduating
seniors and their pa.rents will be sent
to seniors along with their instruc-
tions for Commencement and Com-
mencement week activities, it was an-
nounced today.

The reception is being resumed this
year after an interval of ﬁve years
because of a request of the Student
Faculty Association and the senior
class. It will take place Commence-
ment afternoon, XVednesday, June 5
from 3 to 5 o’clock in the Hotel
Schenley when Dr. and Mrs. Bowman
will be ‘at home’ to the seniors and
their parents.

Administrative officers of the Uni-
versity, the deans of all graduate and
undergraduate schools and all mem-
-bers of the faculty will also be in-
vited to attend.’

A committee of 53 students, under
chairman Leonard Marks, has been
selected to make further plans for the
affair. The entire committee will
meet today in Room 821, Cathedral, at
2:30 o’clock.

The extra-curricular activity of
throwing objects "out of the win-
dows of the Cathedral caused the
second injury within a-‘week when
a workman on the fourth floor roof
was burned, Wednesday, by hot
liquid tar which spatterod him when
an orange was tossed several stories
into the cauldron beside him.

Last Thursday a student was
treated for an eye injury after be-

Mushball, Swimming, Steak Roasts
Replace Munitions, Films,‘ Marriage

 

The Men's and Women’s Debating
Associations will close their year of
forensic activity with a. picnic tomor-
row at the farm of Dr. W. M. Parrish,
near Glenshaw. A program of mush-
ball, swimming and steak roasts will
supplant the usual order of muni-
tions, movie censorship, and the ad-
visability of marrying on $1,500 a
year. '

This year, the men, arguing on the
subject of nationalization of muni-
tions and expansion of foreign trade,
have had an extensive program, Be-
sides many extension debates before
various local organizations, the team
has taken two major trips on which
11 major schools were met. The
Southern trip which included debates
with Louisiana State university at
Baton Rouge, Birmingham-Southern
college at Birmingham, Alabama, and
Tulane university at New Orleans,
was taken by Israel Goldberg, C36,
and Edwin Banks, C35. The men
were accompanied by Richard Mur-
phy. Dr, Parrish accompanied Win-
ston l\lc‘C-onkey, C35, and James Boyle,
C35, on an Eastern tour which'in-
cluded debates at Dartmouth, New
York university, Boston university,
and Colgate.

Devoting themselves largely "to the

questions of movie censorship, mar-
riage, and munitions, the women have

engaged in 20 extension debates and

two Eastern trips. ‘On one to Penn-
sylvania State college, Marcella Ley-,
ton, C37, and Marguerite Swank, C36.
in cooperation with two men from
State convinced audiences that mar-
riage on $1,500 a year was
inadvisable, while Sarah Reish, Ed36,.
and Agnes Calabrese, BA35, argued
on munitions before Penn State and
Temple university. On the second
trip which included the University of
Buffalo, D’Youvi11e. and Allegheny col-
lege, Ruth Friedburg, Ed36, and Betty
Glass C36, discussed munitions.

Combined, the .Men’s and Women's
Debating oﬂfices have received more
than 50 unsolicited invitations from,
schools scattered over. the United
States. .The women received 20 ex-
tension invitations which they could
not fulﬁll.

Among the unsolicited invitations
received by the Men's Association
were those from Dartmouth, New
York university, Pennsylvania -State
college, University of Pennsylvania.
Allegheny college, Miami university,
Washington university at St. Louis,

Carnival Musings

P IN the Stadium \-Vednesday
an effort to revive Spring
Festival took place. 111 the same
Stadium where 60,000 fans have
ﬁlled every square inch of seating
capacity, 350 students trickled,
their bright clothes splotching
the green of the ﬁeld. Some came
for curiosity, others because it
was the thing to do, still others
l)ecaus€- others were coming’.
The 350 enjoyed themselves.
There was as much fun, per cap-
ita, as if the entire student body
had turned out. It may have been
because it was the ﬁrst sunny day
in weeks and weeks of rain. It is
hoped it was evidence of that elu-
sive something called “school
spirit.” which so many clamor for,
and so few do anything about.
Coming as the C‘-arnival did,
two weeks after the general pro-
gram, and almost in the midst of
exams and term papers and late
themes, it did very well for itself.
Those that came left their books
and worries behind them. They
tossed bean bags, took a chance
in SFA’s bingo tent, placed a
foreﬁnger on a number in hopes
of winning a voice recording in
the Debaters’ side show, and had
a laugh at the Publications’ Mu-
seum. Thcy watched the frater-
nity and non-fraternity boys race
and jump and hurdle. They
strutted canes and broke bal-
loons.
They came and they went——but
not until it was over.
They were glad sleeping dogs
had not been left lying.—l\‘l. R.

Photography Scenes

GAINST the unfinished walls

of a room in the Cathedral

are strung a selection of photo-
graphs that make the barrcnness
of the room an attraction. The
Photographic Exhibit which open-
ed ‘\‘\.~'ednesday needs no marble
halls. Its beauty is self sufficient.
. There is no hint of the amateur
in either the pictures themselves
or in the subjects the students
have snapped. There ‘are aero-
planes and street cars, corridors

and stone buildings, pushcart
pcddlers and children playing,
students and workers. It 1S not

the actual subject matter that is
important. It is only that each
of the subjects taken represents to
the student pliotographer a bit of
life that. is more important than
all other life, a more impressive
building, a more appealing scene.
Thus, the importance of the show
will rest mainly on its interpreta-
tion of those persons and objects

of students today. The fact that
many of them are direct retreats
from the hurry and bustle of
modern life is signiﬁcant. The
escape to a world of quiet stone
fronts and motionless planes may
not be deliberate on the part of
the photographer. It may be he
was merely looking for a different
view, a more intricate photo.
Nevertheless he found the diﬁer-

j‘Wider, Please’ Gets Plaudits

Of Student Exhibit Reviewer

iPhotographs Giving Sharp Black, White Contrasts
5

Are Considered Among Nlost Interesting In Show

By Bernard Fleming
About eight months ago, a group of students under the guidance
of Luke Swank, University photographer, began to study photo-

graphy.

with theoretical discussion. Now

Throughout these months they combined practical work

they present their efforts in the

First Animal University of Pittsburgh Photographic Exhibit.
It is the purpose of this reviewer to write about the pictures that
appealed to him most; that they are not in agreement with the judges

is only natural——nat.ura.l because

an appreciation or criticism of

photography is still a matter of personal opinion which doesn’t have
to be backed up by too much knowledge of technique or knowledge
of the work of leading photographers.

The picture that appealed most to’

me is Princeton Nad1er’s “Wider,
Please," which combined good photo-
graphy with an artistic composition.
True, as some say, there isn't enough
action in the picture itself, but the big
scoop with its thick teeth jutting out,
the ﬂat expanse of its bottom plate
outlined against the jet of steam give
a pleasant and stimulating study in
contrasts of black and white.

Another pleasant and original com-
position is George Gehres’ “4:30
Class.” -Here the parallel structure,
that of the girl and the tree's shadow
of the picture appeals to the observer.

There are several unique studies in
lines and contrasts that should appeal
to the followers of “H20” and “Ballet
Mecanique;” they are “Wine Set,” and
“Vat” by Everett Pickering and “Pipes"
by W. L. Thompson. These pictures
give the most vivid. contrasts.

“Wine Set,” a composition of cut
wine glasses and decanter on a con-
trasting background, seems to sparkle
out of the print. It like the other two,
is very realistic, yet interesting.

Another picture along the lines of
realism that is good is “Boards” by
Anthony Colontoni. Here so clear is
the picture, the grain in the boards is
easily discernible.

There is a large number of portraits
for an amateur exhibit, but, some good
ones. Lloyd Thompson’s “Dr. E. Al-
fred Wolf” is, I think, the best. In it,
the full values given to the ‘lines in
Dr. \Vo1f’s face are very real. There
is no exaggeration or striving after
soft effects or dilfusion of lines; the
picture is natural.

Another portrait which has no
straining after artistic effects about
it is Helen Miliiron’s “Mr. Ho11iday.”
Here the old man's smile, his ragged
clothing and felt hat and rough shoes
with the background of the old house
gave a forceful picture typical of Pitts-
burgh’s poorer sections.

Pitt Players’ Banquet l

 

At the Pitt Players’ annual banquet,
to be held next VVednesday evening,
May 22, new officers will be elected
and a program of skits presented by
the group.

The sport pictures are all fast ac-
tion shots of recent track meets. The
prize winner, “Digging In” by Gehres
is one of the best track shots I have
ever seen. Practically every position
for a start is shown by the men leav-
ing, the bodies of the athletes shooting
forward almost parallel to the ground,
the swing of the arms and the tense
muscles of the leg.

“Straining,” a last minute entry by
Janet Savage, has a dynamic appeal
about it with the negro athlete’s body
hurtling forward with legs and arms
arched back in a broad jump.

Another almost perfect shot is “12
I«‘eet” by Gehres showing a. pole vaulter
neatly rolling over the -bamboo
cross bar. From the easy rhythmic
lines of the jumpers body, one might
think pole vaulting an easy pastime,
but it is the ﬁne perception of the
photograhper that creates the illusion.

VValter McLean's “Lobby, 17th
Floor,” showing the elevator lobby of
the new faculty club room on the 17th
ﬂoor of the Cathedral deserves special
mention. To get this excellent indoor
shot McClean had to wave a. power-
ful light back and forth behind his
camera for one minute to get the prop-
er amount of light for the exposure. It
was his ﬁrst try at this type of picture
and was a good one.

Another class of pictures is the
March Hares and Cap and Gown photo-
graphs. These are all Leica. or “min-

ny” camera. shots taken during the
performances of the shows from a seat
in the audience. These were taken
by Pickering.

No matter what a reviewer has to.
say about photography exhibits, every
man will choose other pictures. It is
one of the better things about photo-
graphy that all the Hassenplugs and
the little Hassenplugs will believe
that they and only they can judge a
picture. So if you really want to know
what Pitt’s amateur snap-shotters can
do, why go up to 1428, Cathedral, and
look around. It’s free.

ﬁce for those industrious members of
publications who wrote headlines and
stories while their less serious-minded
brothers frolicked.

But alas and alack, the women’s
sports events were postponed. Not till
next week or the week after, but till
the spring of ’36. Next year’s Spring
Festival committee will ﬁnd itself
richer by two bronze loving C11DS- Be-
tween now and then the cups will re-
pose in Heinz House. The sports equip-
ment was not wasted however as the
women made use of the bean bag
stands, the volleyballs and mushballs
throughout the afternoon. The cups
would have been awarded to the class
scoring the most points in various
sports such as volleyball, bean bags,
jacks, etc., and the class winning the
mushball tournament. Never were so
many "unclassiﬁed” women found in
any one place at any one time.

The numerous men who were run-
ning around all afternoon in shorts.

fraternity emblems, some emblemless
next came in for their share of the
fun. It was the boys from the Kappa
Sigma house who won the Interfrater
nity track meet before the largest
crowd ever to witness the annual af-
fair.

Kappa Sigma was far ahead of the
ﬁeld with a total of 41 points, followed
by Delta Tau Delta, 25%, Sigma Alpha
Epsilon, 201/2, and Phi Kappa and Phi
Gamma Delta with six-points, apiece.
The leaders were always from two to
10 points ahead of the nea.rest com-
petitor in the running score.

Running unattached, Johnny Woods,
Panther gridder, scored victories in
the hundred, 220, and baseball throw
to win three Intramural awards. Prob-
ably the most outstanding perform-
ances in the meet were Groat’s :54
quarter and 5 ft. 9 in. in the high
jump and Wilkin’s 48 ft. 9 in. in the
shot put. Johnny Vvoods also cracked
the existing mark in the baseball
throw.

The ﬁrst place trophy, a large
bronze cup. supporting two miniature
trackmen, was awarded to Kappa Sig-
ma. Delta Tau Delta was given the
smaller runner-up award. The third-
place cup went to Sigma Alpha Epsi-

one-man track team La Rue, was out
of the running this year, ﬁnishing up
in a tie for fourth with Phi Kappa,
with six points.

Look Out Irish! Here Come
The High-Riding Panthers;

Trackmen Risk Clean Record Tomorrow In Battling;
Undefeated Notre Dame Team At South Bend

Two undefeated track teams tangle tomorrow afternoon on Car-
tier ﬁeld when the Pitt track team meets the Irish at South Bend, In-
S Coach Carl Olson led his band of Panther stalwarts out of
Pittsburgh early this morning for Notre Dame.

The Panthers have come right along this year, taking their ﬁrst
three dual meets, winning from Temple, West Virginia and Penn

The outcome of tomorrow’s meet seems to depend on the re-
If the¢

serve strength of each team.
Panthers can come through with a
majority of second and third places,
their chances of adding their fourth
straight win are considerably en-
hanced.

Last season, when the two teams
clashed at the stadium, the Pitt outﬁt
captured enough second and third
places to send the Irish back home
with a defeat. The ﬁnal score was
68 2-3——57 1-3, with each team win-
ning seven ﬁrsts.

On the basis of its performances so
far this season, the-Irish team has four
almost-certain ﬁrst place winners. El-
ser in the shot put has consistently
thrown the 16-pound iron ball past the
49-foot mark. Captain Murphy, star
high jumper, should win his favorite
event, and Mike Layden has been out-
standing in the high-hurdle races.
Their other certainly is in the broad
jump, in which Meagher is the favor-
ite.

Likewise, the Panthers have four
specialities which they should win.
Pelucha ought to take the pole vault,
and Taano or Gongloff should win the
javelin throw. Arvel Fleming is an
almost sure bet in the 220-low hurdles,
and Fassinger and Sieffert have been
throwing well enough to win the dis-
cus.

‘Ine remaining six events on the
program are tossups. Fleming and
Menaker will face stiff competition in
the two sp-rint events from the Notre
Dame entries of Boyle and Frawley.
Fleming won the century last year.
Frawley was timed in 21.7 seconds for
the 220 last Saturday, and Fleming’s
time for the same distance was two-
tenths of a second faster.

In the quarter-mile Notre Dame has
a trio of 50—second men to send against
Kiger, McDonald and -Connelly, Bern-
ard took this event last year against
the Panthers, running a 49.4 quarter.
Kiger hasn’t been pressed in any of
the dual meets this year but ran a fast
440-yard dash last Saturday. Parsons
and Rubly are the other Irish entries.

Half-milers for both schools are
plentiful and good. Ducasse and
Shields pitted against Great and Con-
nelly is the lineup for tomorrow. All
four men are capable of doing the 880
in 1 minute, 56 seconds.

Entries for the Panthers are as
follows:

100-yard dash:
and Spitz.

Golfers Journey
To Detroit Match

Seek To Repeat Earlier Victory
Scored Over Titan Team

Not to be outdone by the Panther
track team which is journeying far
west for its meet tomorrow, the Pitt
golfers leave Pittsburgh today enroute
to Detroit and their return golf
match with the University of Detroit.

In ‘the ﬁrst meeting of the two
schools early this season the golfers
wound up the match in a dead heat,
both scoring three points. Tomor-
row’s battle will bring out just which
team, the Panthers or Detroit, has im-
proved the most through the short
season. ,

The Panthers will enter their ﬁrst
team, the four men who have started
every other match for Pitt this season,
Art Matthews, Captain Regis Wolff,
Jack Wasco, and Paden Gamble. In
the ﬁrst Detroit-Pitt match this sea-
son Wolff and Matthews combined to
give the Panthers their three points.

Detroit will also bank on the same
four men who faced the Panthers here
in Pittsburgh. Bill Crusoe will lead
the way for the home team with Jack
Taylor, Don Laphoon and Jack Wag-
goner rounding out the remainder of
the team. Crusoe was the holder of
the low card in the previous match,
getting a 76 over the tough Oakmont
course.

Advantages tomorrow will all be in
favor of the Detroit boys, since they
will be shooting on familiar ground.
However, the Panthers aim to come
back with another win on their 1935
record and don’t intend to allow a. lit-
tle thing such as a strange course
bother them.

Carlson Closes Spring Sessions
With Stress On Fundamentals

Once more ‘back on their old stamp-
ing grounds, the Panther prospective
1936 basketball squad put the ﬁnish-
ing touches on its spring practice
sessions this afternoon in the stadium
with a ﬁnal review of Dr. Carlson’s
new angle of basketball plays.

The good doctor and his boys have
been, for the past two weeks, forced
to do their pivoting and passing on
an imaginary court out on the stadi-

Freshman Tennis Team Beats Dukes
As New Star Is Uncovered In Mogan

 

Whanging its way through to an-
other victory, the freshman tennis
team defeated the Duquesne fresh-
men, losing only two matches out of
the eight played.

The Pitt boys took four of the six
singles matches and "both the doubles
affairs. McConnell, at No. 2, and
Hammond at No. 5, won the only Du-
quesne victories, the latter showing
plenty with a fast drive and an unget-
table slice as be defeated Dick Conti,
6-0, 6-2.

Ralph Bald, captain and No. 1 man,
was his usual cool self, and had little
trouble with Deithorn, the Bluff’s best
freshman player. Tom Locke, Pitt No.
4 man, clowned through his match to
win 6-1, 6-2, and Solow and Glasser
had no trouble at Nos. 3 and 6.

McKenna of Pitt and McConnel
struggled through a long three-set
match, with the little Duquesne boy
coming out on the top end of the
score, 2-6, 6-3, 9-7.

Anew star came out in the f1‘esh-

man ﬁrmament as John Megan, out-
standing last year on Carrick’s cham-
pionship squad, paired with Ralph
Bald to win the ﬂrst doubles match in
straight sets. Megan, with sharp line-
cutting strokes and a nice overhead
smash had before been missed by the
eyes of Coach O’Loughlin, but his
flashy play has won him the No. 2 posi-
tion and shoved McKenna, Solow.
Locke, Conti and Glasser down a peg,
respectively

Locke and Solow, playing the other
doubles match, ﬁnally began to con-
centrate, and showed beautiful team-
work at the net and at mid-court as
they defeated Weber and Kloos of Du-
quesne, in two 6-1 sets.

The Pitt freshmen travel to Mount
Lebanon high school this afternoon
for a return match with the South
Hills boys, whom they defeated at the
stadium, 6-3. The schedule for Mon-
day and Wednesday shows return
matches with Duquesne and Carnegie
Tech, respectively.

Kappa Sigma Exhibits Slugging
Power In Eliminating Pi K A

Two nines, Delta Tau Delta and
Kappa Sigma, punched their way to
the semi-final round, along with Sigma
Alpha Mu, on a bye. and either Phi
Delta Theta or Sigma Alpha Epsilon,
depending on the outcome of the play-
off.

The championship game for the
Greek title will be played today on the
football practice ﬁeld between the
two semi-final winners.

In Wednesday’s quarter ﬁnal
matches, Kappa Sigma sluggers belted
eight home runs while scoring a 12-4
victory over Pi Kappa Alpha. Beach-
ler pitched ﬁve—hit ball for the win-
ners. while Truesch was being hit.
hard throughout the six and one-half
inning stretch.

In the other round-of-eight match,
Delta Tau Delta defeated Phi Kappa,
7-3. Davis was effective the entire
game; but Suba, Phi Kap ﬁinger, was
relieved in the third after allowing
three runs in the ﬁrst and three again
in the third.

Sigma Alpha Epsilon earned a ticket
to the quarter-ﬁnals by outscoring
Sigma Alpha Mu, 10-S. Pinsky, SAM
pitching ace, tripped over Rube, SAE
inﬁelder. in the last-half of the sev-
enth, suffering a severe injury to his
right arm. ,

Pinsky had previously been re-
lieved from the pitching assignment,
to save him for a possible “nightcap”
with Sigma Chi. However, the Pi
Lams spoiled Sigma Chi’s chances to
continue in the tourney by winning
in the early game. Baskin pitched for
Andrews getting
credit for the victory,

Rosenbloom pitched the Pi Lams to
victory, 10-7, in the Sigma Chi upset.
However, the victory meant nothing
to the Pi Lams inasmuch as they had
previously been defeated by both
Phi Kappa and Kappa Sigma.

Three cups will go to the champion,
runner-up and third place nines, re-
spectively. The play-off between the
two semi-ﬁnal losers will take place
today at the same time as the cham-
pionship game. The Greek winner
plays the Upperbracket (Intramural)
leader for the Intramural title on Mon-
day.

Defending their 8-1 victory of
earlier this season, the Panther net-
mon will play host to the racquetmen
of Bethany college here tomorrow.

The Panther racqueteers have been
showing plenty of stuff here of late.
Since losing a close match to George
VVashington university and getting
walloped by the Navy, Pitt has taken
over Georgetown. Bethany, Grove
City, Duquesne and Wash-Jet! without
a miss in the whole string.

Against Bethany Dr. David O’Lough-
lin, Pitt tennis mentor, will probably
use the same six men he has depend-
ed on most of the season. The boys
who will swing for Pitt are Bob and
Joe Madden, Roy Heckler, Jim Thomp-

son, Jim Slocum and Alex Wilson.

Fall Plans Today,

Program Includes 'i’raining Period ;
On Speech Technique; Unit ;

Concludes Session 

 

 

Sara. Reish, C36, new president of
the 'Women’s Debating association,
has drawn up her plans for next X981‘.
she announced today. l

Chief among Miss Rc-isli’s plans is
one for a ﬁt'th—hour class on i‘vlonday,
a time which Miss Theresa M. Kahn,
women’s debating coach, would use as
a training period on good debate and
speech technique.

Miss Reish also intends to try to
bring several speakers to the campus
next year to present informally to the
debaters some tips on good D0SU11'€
while speaking, on forum discussion
methods, etc. The Association had
only one such speaker last year:
namely, Miss E-lizabeth C. Rcarick, as-
sistant professor of physical educa-
tion, who gave the group some helpful
hints on posture.

Topics for next year's debates have
not yet been chosen. “But,” says Miss
Reish, “we do want to get the inter-
collegiate season started earlier next
time, and we would like to choose
some topic for our extension debates
that is of general interest, probably
community health.”

From fifteen to twenty extension de-
bates are presented by the Women's
Debating association every year be-
fore parent-teacher associations and
similar local organizations. The sub-
ject used during the past year for
these debates was: “Resolved, that
the movies do more harm than good.”

Today, with a. debate on the movie
question in which Sessertaro, fresh-
man debating unit, will take the af-
firmative side and Westinghouse High
school will take the negative side, the
Association will conclude their pro-
gram for the semester. Dolly Kied-
aisch and Marion Kamin will repre-
sent Sessertaro in today’s debate,
which will take place in Room 215,
Alumni hall.

School Chaplain
Plans Breakfast

O’Connell Sponsors Communion
" For Catholics Sunday

 

 

The Reverend E. Lawrence O'Con-
nell will be "a spiritual dean for
Catholic students,” he said in an in-
terview with The Pitt News yester-
day. The new University chaplain,
recently appointed by the Chancellor,
has already planned the scope of his
ictivities here.

“The prime purpose,” said Father
O’Connel1, “is for Catholic students‘
guidance and advice. Students, Cath-
olics or non-Catholics, may feel free
to come into my otllce at any time to
discuss any problems, religious or
otherwise, with which they may be
faced.”

“After all,” he continued, “the prin-
cipal objective of a University, as ex-
pressed by Cardinal Newman, is to de-
velop the entire man; man in all his
aspects. And the spiritual is certain-
ly one of the most important of these
aspects.

“Harvard, Columbia, Princeton,
Yale, Nebraska, Michigan, and other
institutions of their size have had
Catholic chaplains for over 25 years.
At the University of Illinois the chap-
lain spends his time with the students
and manages the college chapel: a
full-time job.”

As his [first official act, Father
O"Connell announced a communion
breakfast for all Catholic students,
Sunday, May 26, at Central Catholic
High school, Fifth avenue. The stu-
dents will attend Mass at 10 o'clock
in St. Paul's Cathedral, and the break-
fast will be held immediately after
the Mass.

AIEE Banquet

Amid the strains of Jimmy Bray’s
music, the members of the student
branch of the American Institute of
Electrical Engineers held their 15th
annual banquet Vvednesday evening at
the University club.

After a speech by Francis J. Ches-
terman, vice president and general
manager of the Bell Telephone com-
pany of Pennsylvania, and a few re-
marks by E. A. Holbrook, dean of the
Schools of Engineering and Mines,
decks were cleared for action, or pos-
sibly it is better to say that the cur-
rent was turned on. V ' '

An “Our Gang Comedy” was follow-
ed by a skit on each of the members of
the faculty inthe electrical engineer-
ing department, each of v.-‘horn was
then inducted into an “honor-a.ry” so-
ciety. '

A feature of the progra111'w;1s‘tlie
presentation of a three act play “’l‘he-
Great American Drama,” but the cast.
failed to vouch either for its ‘great-
ness, Americanism, or its dramatic
excellence.

Then amid ﬁtting ceremonies the
seniors in electrical engineering pre-
sented various gifts to outstanding
people in the department, including H.
E. Dyche, professor and head of the
department, to whom went soap and
a mop “with which to clean up the
department.”

The junior class received a choice
list of carefully selected cuss-words.‘
