‘ ‘Congress Holdovers

Coalition Fraud
Rap Ilisallowed

The Coalition Party ‘charge of
fraud in men’s elections ‘was toss-
ed out the window by Student
Congress Friday after a ‘complete
ballot recount showed a 4.5 per-
cent error. '

The recounting was done by at

committee headed by Flora Diem-
ert and indicated that 144 ballots
were cast for’ which there was no
record in the dean of men’s ﬁles.
Of these 36 were in the college and
26 ‘in’ Bus Ad. Total vote was
2,553. , V .’

After the charge of fraud had
been ‘cleared away, Congress elect-
ed Pat Leix, Don Wilde, and Dave
Fox as carryover members to
nevt year’s Congress.

Miss Leix was in charge of ‘as-
semblies this year; Wilde headed

the Pitt Chest Council, and Fox‘

was chairman of the Social Com-
mittee.

Officers for next year will be
elected at the Student Congress
banquet tonight. . I

At the fraud hearing, Stuart
Workmaster,_ representing the «Co-
alition, objected to the inclusion
of Ellsworth Center in the college
tally, stating, that ‘a “nine percent
errorwas shown without the Cen-.
ter vote.” ’ ‘

The Coalition Part ,’s main
‘charges of fraud had een con-
cerned with Commons Room vot-
ing, he said. '

The election chairman, Don
Wilde, pointed out there was no

way to. separate the ballots, which
had been put together before
tallying‘. He also said ‘‘You’re try-
ing to get an impossible thing—an
ideal election.” 5

Booklet Lists
Guides to Help.
Interviews

BETHLEHEM, PA. —- (I. P.) ——
A new booklet, “Senior Placement
Information,” authored by E. Rob-
ins Morgan, director of placement
at Lehigh University, lists nine
factors for successful interviews
which give easy manners and good
grooming as well as technical abil-’

- ity andknow-how an important

part in helping a student land an
attractive job.

Here are Morgan’s points: “Be-
fore entering ah‘ interview, know

‘ something about the size of__the -

company,'its financial standing,

its products and their uses.”
“Be well groomed. Your clothes»

se\ntable.” ;

/“Be cordial in greeting an,inter—
viewer.,This is good business as
well as good manners. You like a
ﬁrm: handshake and a gehialsmile

._—so does the interviewer.“

“Be yourself. Affectations are
readily discernable "even to inex-
perienced persons and they do not
give favorable impressions_L”.

“Sit comfortably erect in your
chair.” . ’

“Be at ease.”

“Show ydur interest in thevtype
of employment being offered.”

“Let your speech be articulate.
The interviewer has the right to
know what you are saying.”

“To be .cocky is inexcusable. It
is not businesslike, it is not cour-
teous, and it is not proﬁtable.”

According to Morgan the three
deciding .factors in placement are
character, ability and personality.
“The value of good character needs
explanation to those only who do
not possess it. A college man’s
ability will be guaged by scholastic

curricular activities, and a knowl-
edge of current events.” ‘

Co’Il—elg“e—_§l~:—i'—\‘Iiey. A
Reveals" ideal  
Date Musfs  

.CHARLESTON, Illinois-(ACP)
-—Featur'e writers at Eastern 1111-
nois State College have made a
boy and girl survey on dating.

On the question of how much
a boy. is" expected to spend, 77

was énough and if y'ou’re lucky,
you may rurracross the other 23

date to spend more than $1.

When asked about the boys’
apparel, 60.5 percent of the coeds
preferred a , shirt, sweater and
pants combination wh_ile 39.5 per-
cent favored a sports outﬁt. Suits
didn’t even get-into, the race._

As to “-Where ”will we go?” boys. .

and girls were pretty much in
agreement. Ninety-two percent
of the girls wanted to date. good
dancers and 85 percent of the
boys thought their dates should
dance well. ' \

Just in case an Illinois student
may be thinking of going around
by the tavern, he better forget it
because only 23 percent- of the
girls looked even tolerantly on

_ drinking.

He would do better to develop
his personality since both sexes
agreed that, “If you’re _amusing
you've got the girls behind‘ you
100 percent and if your personality
is one of those million dollar va-
rieties, then count your lucky
stars." ‘ V

Declarer has no problem—he discards his small club.,B11tl
again West is forced to give up ra.-stopper. He must discard
either the Ace of clubs or a diamond. The natura.l,play isto
let go a diamond; but it doesn’t really’ make much diﬁerence,
for South takes all the ‘tricks in either event. '

‘ Just why did South choose this line of play? That 7s a_ ques-
tion that I’m sure occurs to many of you. He could have play-
edto take allthe tricks, staking his ‘hopes on-an-even‘ ,break'_1n’,
diamonds. He didn’t because he realized that they mig‘l_1_i;"notl
break and that if they didn’t he still had a chance to make;
his contract by squeezing West. If the squeeze failed to de‘-._
velop, he could alwaysplay for the diamond split." _, 

In other words thesqueeze play gave him an extra-chancej

Dyke of the dean"of women’s staff or one of her assistants is pre-

When asked about unusual questions by your reporter, blond

and charming Miss Van Dyke got¢ ' .- . ‘

a merry twinkle in her blue eyes
and told about the anxious mother
who asked how to get her boy en-
rolled in Med School.

It seems she had heard that
competition was great for that
school and wanted to make certain
her son was enrolled in time-
he was four years old..The moth-
er was sure her son would make
a good doctor because he called
his teddy bear “doctor.”

One inquirer was very much
concerned over the date that
school janitors would be paid—
may have been a janitor’s wife.
Another puzzled phoner said he
had found a letter in “some for-
eign language” and would like to
have it deciphered.

The baseball picture had bright-

when the Panthers edged the
strong Salem Tigers, 2-1. Squeezed
in between the Salem and West

win over Clarion, 7-4, on Thursday
at Schenley Oval. _

will face Salem on May 10 and

Two "losses are_n’t the real rea-
son for gloom in the Mittmen
camp. The way in which they were
lost is what has Mitterling wor-
ried. Any assists in the box scores
were purely accidental. Many of

' Mitterling. is hoping his team
may have pressed too hard against
the West Virginians. Theplayers,
coaches and many observers who

saw both West Virginia and Salem '

in action give the nod to the Tigers
as a better ballclub. .

The Mounties looked as poor on
Saturday as Pitt did the day be-

Pitt Fullbacks

Pitt’s spring practice journey to
Rutgers proved a little hard on
the Panther ﬁrst line fullbacks.

In the three-hour scrimmage on
Saturday, Carl Depasqua, Bobby
Becker, and Hal Wertman all
found their way to the injured list
‘and probably won’t be ready to
play in the intra-squad game Sat,-
urday. . ‘

day he C3n"C is available for duty.

On the whole, the Panther coach
was pleased with the results of the
scrimmage. Milligan alternated
four groups in the-"game, each
squad scrimmaging for a solid
half hour. No score was kept, and
play was halted" whenever one
team drove to the opporient’s 20-’
yard line. '

Jumping Al ﬁnished off the busy

day at the Stadium by winning‘

the broad jump with a 20’ 8” leap,
and took third in the shot put, an-
other feat he hadn’t tried before
Saturday. - '
Meanwhile at the Philadelphia
Penn Relays, Coach’ Carl Olson
and 16 members of his squad fared

even worse than the J ayvees when-

they failed to win a place.

Olson explained the dismal relay
showing‘ to be due to “just plain
bad luck,” and “injuries that did-
n’t respond to rest.” '

In their defense of the-‘shuttle

hurdle relay championship, Bill
Raney tripped‘ on the seventh hur-
dle and then fell. Bob McKowen
was hurdling with a bad leg.

Approximately one-third of the
8000 veterans counseled at the
Guidance Center since its begin-

said.‘ Many of these have pre-
