Change In SC By-Laws

Giving Voice to Small
Groups Gets Support

By JOHN KULAMER
Taking their cue from the national scene, where cam-
paigning and presidential primaries are beginning to hold the
public’s attention, campus bigwigs stirred up a college-type

-political stew of their own this week.

A movement is underway to revise the by-laws of Student
Congress to “provide a broader base of student representation

to that body.” A A
Meeting Scheduled

A meeting of_ a Congress com-
mittee of the whole (that is, the
whole outﬁt) is scheduled for 1:30
p.m. today in 83.2 -Cl to discuss the
proposed revision.

Backers of the idea are inter-
preting “broader base of represei—
tation” as meaning that SC would
have a higher ratio of members

‘ representing small campus groups

which now have little or no di-
rect voice in student government.

Two of the more influential pol-
iticos on campus, SC prexy Cyril
Wecht, and WSGA head Nancy
Tear, seemed to be all for the idea.

Said Wecht: “There is a vital
need for a change in the represen-
tation of Student Congress mem-
bers. Members would show much
more interest and work much
harder if they were representing
a group to which they were re-
sponsible.

Must Allow For All

Of course, some members would

still have to,.be elected at large in

order to allow for opinion from
3|: * *

the student body as a whole.

“The change in representation
would mean a complete new set-
up as far as nominations and elec-
tions are concerned. But the
change is. absolutely, necessary if
Student Congress ever intends to
function properly.”

Said Miss Tear—: “More interest
in student government should be
the result of representation in
Student Congress from small
groups on campus.

Methods Artiﬁcial

“This year Congress has set up
a Pep committee and a Poll’ com-
mittee. These are artiﬁcial meth-
ods for developing interest. Such
things as ‘spirit’ and a knowledge
of student opinion should come
automatically in the very machin-
ery of student government.

“With the backing of campus
organizations, Congress could

more truly represent every student
at Pitt.”

Congress VP Bob Gardner had
his own ideas on just how that

ships provided by the Robert S.
Marshall Memorial Fund for Class-
ics. They are the ﬁrst to receive
aid from the fund.

two years ago in the will of Dr.
Marshall, ‘a prominent Pittsburgh.
physician and former medical
president of Shadyside Hospital.

He stated in his will, “In review
of the years of my life I believe
that I have acquired . . . my most
satisfactory values through study
and an understanding of classical
languages and literature.”

That sounds like a description
of the weary student’s dream col-
lege, but it’s simply one of the
down-to-earth features offered by
the Carnegie Institute Society to
its members.

The lectures, given each Tues-
day evening from October to

'_March, aren’t the sleep-inducing

variety, since they cover . every-
thing from deep-sea diving to
banana forests.
Winged Knowledge

Although the Society doesn't
guarantee live entertainment with
lectures, it managed to include
this year a soaring chap called Mr.
Ramshaw.

In fact, Mr. Ramshaw, a golden

V

eagle owned by Captain C. W. R.
Knight, soared obligingly out over
the audience during a lecture on
fowling in rural England.

Besides the lectures, Society
members receive a number of oth-
er beneﬁts. ,

They -are automatically sub-
scribers Ato Carnegie Magazine,
which contains articles by au-
"thorities on the arts and sciences.

Members also‘ receive tuition
reductions for adult art, craft, and
nature courses offered by the Car-
negie Institute Division of Edu-
cation.

Taxidermy Included

Oil painting, portrait photogra-
phy, silk screen printing, ‘and tax-
idermy are some of the more un-
usual subjects studied in these
classes.

‘ Spring Festival planners have added a new event to the
list of the usual Festival activities.

“ ome’n Around,” the designation for“ the sorority open

house day, will be held-Wednesday, May 15, from 3:30 ,to

5:15 p.m.

The sixteen sororities on cam-
pus will pair off to decorate eight
of the sorority houses in compe-
tition for trophies. The houses will
be decorated inside and out and
centered about the Festival theme
“PITT-y the ROMANS.”

Two Trophies Awarded

Two trophies will be awarded
for the most original decorations
adapted to the theme. One trophy
will go to the hostess house and
one to the guest sorority. Presch-
tation of awards will be made at

the main ball, Friday, May 17.

G r a c e Lyon, chairman of
“Rome’n Around,” has announced
that all sororities should send a
representative to a general meet-
ing today in 1202 C1 at 2:30 p.m.

Paul Eckstein, chairman of the

ed that this year thesoap-box der-

The surprising postcript to this
little detail is that all members,

uted, receive the same privileges,
and’ memberships are tax-d_educti-
ble.

Although there are quite a few
$1,000 memberships, James Aus-
tin, executive secretary of the
Society, hastens. to add that stu-
dents of more modest means are
equally welcome.

“After all,”‘ he remarked, “The

in many ways.” '

Presents Opportunities

Mr. Austin, who has been with
the Society for three years, point-
ed out that members also receive
invitations to Founder’s Day"ce1e-
brations, and to Open House.

“The program opens up a much
wider participation in the insti-
tute,” said Austin.’

And he means “wide” because
anyone from the high school stu-
dent to the wealthy society wom-
an may belong, and does.

But everytime a student, or group of stu-
dents, is designated as representing a_ par-
ticular .v1rtue or special ideal, there is a cer-
tain amount of dissatisfaction about those
who are chosen or those who are not chosen.
In this case the dissatisfaction will arise
over those who were not included. There
‘ were some obvious candidates overlooked.

Ordinarily, this could be taken asgmere

‘W , grumbling.- But'the committee might very

easily have added at least two more names
to the list of candidates. The maximum num-
ber was seven with the possibility of eight.

We feel that we are expressing the senti-
ments of.-a majority of students when we
register our protest over the committee’s fail-
ure to select the maximum number. We are
especially perturbed because there were so

, many others who, while they might not be

equal to those chosen, were at least worthy
of consideration by the women Voters.

As it was, the committee picked ﬁve girls
qualiﬁed in every way. They left out some
who should have been named.

All Sides '

WASH GJEBRE

An investigating committee, appointed to check
Communistic indoctrination at Yale University, re-

“cently reported that universities “should teach all

sides of any problem”——Commuhism inclusive.’
Said the report: “In. a university, knowledge
should be pursued with all channels of information

freely open to the student. In the ideal university, 1
" all sides of any issue are presented as impartially-

and as forcefully. as possible; all sides, not just
those that may be currently popular with the
trustees and the alumni.” . _

"’ Communistic trends have been prevalent‘ in this
country but yet school authorities refuse to en-
lighten the student,’ whose mind has been c{am-
*med with a myriad of misinterpretations and. dis-
beliefs on the‘ controversial, issue. Hence, a threat

to‘ our academic freedom accompanied by confusion. \

If we are to clear up this confusion, schools
should make some effort, as ‘the committee at Yale

g suggesits, to “teach all sides,” regardless what the

subject might be.

i It would be an excellent idea if universities
took steps to offer a course dealing with present
day Communistic living—-—its beneﬁts (if any), its
composition, and its defects. After all, without such
useful information how are we, who will one day
be" “leaders” in that society, to recognize Commun-
ism? .. How are we to cope with problems involved
in its make-up, and the effect it has on lives? Or
are we to discard it like an old shoe, only to be
taken in like so -many thousands because of shear
ignorance? ’
The,only mention of Communism in our col-
leges today comes out of musty, outdated history

_ ‘books dealing with the irretrievable pas’t, plus a

few half-baked theories by some senile professor.
We’ve got to study “current Communistic trends as
they -exist today!

What would be wrong with adding a new course
to Pitt’s study list, and other schools’ all over the
_United States, for that matter. In such a course
one might grasp some useful information about
Communism and learn to apply that information
to ‘better society and, in addition to adjust his way
of life accordingly. ' i

The proposed course would probably tend to
impede indoctrination and subversities rather than
glorify them. But apparently school heads don’t

 trust the students’ discretion. Surely we are past
the puerile stage of thinking and know the dif-
ference between right and wrong. , «

If measures were taken to teach a course in
Communism, one of the most important factors
would be the teacher. He, or she, should be learn-
ed, trustworthy, and have the integrity to give the
class a clear picture on both sides of the contro-
versy. ‘

The instructor in this case should not have
learned Communism from his vicarious experiences
in a history book on Russia but more readily from
having been affiliated, directly or indirectly, with
Party prodeedures. '

Such persons are Arthur Koestler, Richard
Wright, and Ignazio Silone, who epitomize their
disillusioned experiences in the Party, in “The
God That'Failed,” would be excellent teachers for
a course on Communism. These prospectives are
qualiﬁed to teach the pros and cons of the (contro-
versy at large. p

The colleges and universities need not fear in-

note this yet, but Wall Street
sidewalks wouldn’t have been so
messy for the street cleaners in
’29 if the. ﬁnanciers had been‘
able to see what was,— hiding
around the corner.

The fact is that the cost of liv-
ing right now looks like a bar-
ber-pole. Saw by the papers the
other day that l’939’s $10 food
basket costs $25.49 today.

And the poor people who pa-
triotically bought war bonds for
$18.75 found out last year that
their $25 maturity value ($4 for
every $3, remember) wouldn’t
even buy as much. vegetables and
meat as the $13.75 would have
bought ten years ago.

you’ll soon have to drop in a sil-

In China during the war, in-
ﬂation got so bad that people had
to carry a bushelbasket full of
paper to the corner store to get a

of silver dollars or any dollars is
just too big a load to carry
around.

Me, I’m glad I live close

Truman’s economists and big-

union economists look at this.

isn’t it? It's been spinning and

~ spinning, and the hot air from

Korea and the blasts from Siberia
have speeded it up, haven’t they?

I Don’t worry, it’ll slow down and

things will get back to normal.”

I never was ' exceptionally
bright in physics or optical illu-
sions, let alone economics, but
ever since I ﬁrst saw my ﬁrst
barber pole I’ve been fascinated
by.the spirals that just go up and
up. The only ones that, didn’t
keep spiraling upvhad busted.

It isn’t so much the coffee and
the bonds and the vegetables.
What really worries me is what
life’s going to be -like when I get
out of school and go to work after
a hitch in the service. If you

_ wait until you have a decent

enough pile to get married and
start right, with furniture, maybe
a second-hand car, and ailittle
cash in the bank toward a piece
of ground and a house ofyour
own, you probably never will get
around to getting married. Un-
less a rich uncle dies.

Oh, yeah, I know we have to
stay strong militarily, and that
costs money. But guns around
the house are always dangerous
when they’re kept loaded.

Everybody, I think, could also
do a little honest praying that the
barber pole will slow down with-
out breaking and the guns will
never be ﬁred.

If enough people don’t do both,
it’s small consolation that the
barber (or the human race)
could still go on doing business
even if the spinning pole broke
or somebody ruined it with a
B-B gun (or an atom bomb).

Maybe all this talk about poles
will just make peoples heads
spin. '

But personally I’d kind of like
to feel that I had a hand in
handling -the loaded guns or bar-
ber poles of coffeeprices, rather
than sit in a rocking-chair and
take my chances on still being a

customer after an atom bomb

or an economic collapse breaks
the barber-pole spiral.

No Censors Wanted

LOIS FOIGHT
The Daily Californian

Petitions are circulating among the students
of the University of California, this week, to free
the Daily Californian from the supervision of an
advisory board appointed for last semester.,

The Californian, run entirely under the direc-
tion of student editors for the last 54 years, was
saddled gwith a day-to—day advisor, “ an advisory
board, and constitutional juris-
diction over its policies by the
ASUC Executive committee.

‘The executive committee’s
resolution, which was introduced
one day and passed two days
later, has met the opposition of
both student body and newspaper
staff since its passage. The meas-
ure was taken at the end of last
semester when the Californian _ ....
.was under ﬁre from members of the University
Board of Regents for publishing articles contrib-
uted by a non—staff member thought to be pro-
Soviet. _ '

The petitions will be presented to the Execu-
tive Committee asking that the “entire original ac-
tion” be. rescinded. In the meantime, the Daily

Californian,’ is under daily supervision and cen-

sorship. ~

The Daily Tar Heel

Suggestions of student press restriction and su-

pervision, have cropped up at the University of

North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

Tar Heel editors expected an attempt to set up
supervision of the three student newspapers of_the
Consolidated University by its trustees at a re-
cent meeting. ”

The attempt has been expected by the news-‘
-papers since the Carolinian, weekly at the Wom-
en’s*College, attacked the “tactics and activities of

Clark on the issue of segre-
gation.” ' « ’

In a front page editorial, Clark was accused of
‘‘a little gum-shoe work on students at Chapel Hill
whom he considered subversive.”_ Clark had writ-
ten to ‘mayors of two cities for information about

students who had insisted “that there "be no segre- »

gation ofraces in meetings held on the campus at
Chapel Hill.” Clark stated himself as opposed to
“this sort of thing,” and wanted to know whether
the students had. “become imbued with these ideas”-
since they became students at Chapel Hill.

A Frats Want Change

CLARK SUTTON

It once was easy to ﬁnd a friend in the Tuck I

Shop. He or she was almost always parked in one
certain spot, designated with such original name:
as the “Theta booth,” the “Delta Sig booth,” or
just plainv“student’s booth.” But now some of the

leading lights on campus, have thrown caution to,

the winds and have decided to change booths. Con-
fusion is the result; open war
fare seems imminent.
Dissatisﬁed with their present
booths, some fraternities have
voted to move to greener pas-
tures. This pioneer spirit is most
iadmirable, but it so happens that
every available booth in, the
Tuck Shop is already claimed by
one group or another. As a re-
not ,moving into unclaimed territory, it IS uniniti-
gated invasion of private property.

Arguments by the invaded groups are, strong M’
and spiced with brilliant logic. “After all,” one 

of the victims of, this mass migration said, “they

just can’t vote to move into our booth. We voted ‘

to occupy it long before they even knew the Tuck
Shop existed. A basic democratic principle is be-
ing attacked when ﬁrst property rights mean noth-
ing to civilized.pe‘ople.”

To make matters worse, the leaders of the in-
vasion forces can’t seem to control their own men.
The troops are not satisﬁed with their newly-won
territories, and, are shifting back and forth from
booth tobooth, making it almost impossible to
define the actual -battle camps.

Before the movement started each group had
its own little niche where its members knew their
own kind could always be found. Peace and se-
renity reigned, and each little kingdom settled its
own problems in its own way. Fraternities helped
sororities rush prettier women, and sororities help-
ed fraternities rush more social-minded men. It

was mutual aid, they just didn’t give up and in-

vade another man’s territory.

Such senseless disregard for law and order can-
not be condoned, and the level-headed and sensi-
ble elder statesmen of the Tuck Shop should at-
tempt to put a stop to this nonsense. No good
will come out of the whole‘ affair. Blood will be
shed, social groups will be scattered-to the four

First Title
In 12 Years

By RUSS FRANKE

After twelve. title-hungry’
years, the Panther tankers
all but devoured their Eastern
Collegiate fellow members last

_ week-end in New York by finish-

ing 40 points ‘ahead of their near-

- est rival.

Coach Ben Grady’s crack squad
grabbed four first places for 99
points and the championship of the

' Eastern Collegiate Swimming As-

sociation. Rutgers, last year’s

59.

Chief point—getter for Pitt was
Ronnie Gainsford, who won both
the 100 and 200-yard breast stroke
and_ teamed up with Don Fanning
‘and Jules Melograne to take the
300—yard medley relay. Gains-
ford’s 1:01.2 time in the 100 set a
new ECSA record for that event.

Blosser Cops Diving

The 300-yard medley relay vic-
tory and first place‘ in the 400-
yard free style relay won by Har-
ry Piwowarski, Melograne, Jim
Zentgraf, and Bill Corr accounted
for 26 points. V

Ace diver Tom Blosser captured
first place in the low board dive
and second in the high board be-
hind Rutgers’ George Gregario to

.contribute 12 points toward the

Panther victory. , -
This meet, the 29th in ECSA
history, was originally scheduled

Riflers, Harriers Still Win

By GEORGE -MEHAFFEY

The winter sports program at Pitt continued on the up-
grade as Sgt..Pau1 Bryant’s riﬂers and Carl Olson’s track
squad toppled all opposition last weekend.

The Pitt sharpshooters tied thee

Greater Pittsburgh Riﬂe League
tighter than a Scotchman’s purse,
as they outgunned Duquesne for
the third time this season by a
1387-1375 score and then avenged
an early season loss to West Vir-
ginia, edging the Mountaineers,
1400-1398. The Panther marks-
men ‘have now gained seven vic-
tories in eight starts, a record
identical to that sported by the
Mountaineers. ,

A dual match with California
State Teachers on Tuesday and a
later match with the cross park
rivals from Carnegie Tech will
round out league action. The J un-
gle Cats have copped the laurels in
two previous encounters with the
Tartans and in an earlier contest
with the Vulcans.

On Mar. 22 Pitt will represent
western Pennsylvania’ in a Re-
gional match at Buffalo against
“target jockies” from Ohio State,
West Virginia, Rochester, and
other schools yet to be named.

Harriers in Walk-Away

Meanwhile at Schoonmaker Hall
in South Park the Panther thin-
clads were wrapping up, as usual,
the AAU Meet with 56% points to
seven for its nearest competitors
from East Palestine High, Ohio
and Bethany College.

Pittites will get a preview of
what to expect of this seasorfs
team when Olson sends a squad
of approximately ten trackmen to
Cleveland for the Knights of Co-
lumbus meet on Friday night. The

Pitt mentor hopes his proteges can
do as well as the 1950 Panther ag-
gregation which set a record of
3:23 in the mile relay and copped
second place in the two-mile relay
event.
Kuzma A Probable

Among those sure of making the
trip are the mile relay quartet of
Ray Lee, Bruce Giron, Joe Dudas,
and Charles Fritz; the sprint com-
bination of Chaunsey Hudson and
John Patellos and hurdler Wally
Monahan.

The Invitation Committee of the
K of C holds the answers to who
will make-up the remaining por-
tionof Olson’s squad. If the Pan-
thers get an invitation to send a
two-mile relay team, Frank. Kuz-
ma, Ed Carne-
gie, Dick Web-
ber and Bernie
Luterancik will
carry the hopes
of the Blue and
Gold.

If K u z m a ,

In Change

By BORIS WEIN STEIN

Pitt has a new tennis coach
today because the doctor went
out on a permanent call.

In this case, the doctor is David
O’Loughlin, veteran net coach for
l9 years, who resigned from the
post he held here since 1931 due
to increasing pressure of his pro-
fessional duties.

Jim Tully, a part-time instructor
on the athletic staff and head of
the squash department, replaces
O’Lough1in as tennis boss.

Voluntary Worker

Tully is a professional in tennis
and squash at the Pittsburgh Golf
Club and the ex-national profes-
sional squash champion of 1950-
51. I-I,e’s' responsible for develop-
ing most of the outstanding tennis
players in the district today.

O’Loughlin’s tenure at Pitt was

voluntary and his resignation was

only accepted by Athletic Director
Tom Hamilton after he requested
relief.

“Pitt is Very fortunate tolhave
had Dr. O’Loughlin’s help for such
a long period of time,” said Ham-
ilton. “We are sorry to lose him.
We know, however, what sacri-
ﬁces, as a leading obstetrician, he
made to give his time to Pitt
tennis.” 1

Coached 129 Victories

In 19 seasons, the Panthers, un-
der O’Loughlin, won 129 matches
and lost 52. He produced the
greatest netters in Pitt history.

Among these were: Eddie Jac-

obs, one of the nation’s top—rated ‘

players in the early thirties, Mort
Baker, Ralph and Bob Bald, Irv
Goodman, and more recently
Johnny Lohstoeter of last year’s
team, and Harry Campney of the
current 'Pitt squad.

O’Lough1in was a tennis star
himself in 1927, 28, and 30, and
took over as head coach after
graduating from Medical School
in 1931.

‘Besides his
Tully will have to overcome the
handicap of ﬁelding a team with-'
out tennis courts. Pitt has been
without its own courts since 1946.

On Oct. 26, 1939 a young University of Michigan graduate
took over the reins of the Pitt swimming team. At the com-

Little did he know at that time that it would be

After spotting the Civil A’s an eight-point lead, the In-
dustrial Engineers roared from behind to win handily, 40-
28, Monday afternoon to become the Engineering League’s
champion. They had gone through the regular play unde-
feated, as did Civil A, both having identical 7-0 records.

‘ marked a high

vincing fashion by outdistancing
their nearest rival by 40 points.
And for Coach
Ben Grady it

p oint in his
twelve years at
Pitt. In fact,
Grady is so en-
thused by his
team’s showing
that he harbors
thoughts of giv-
ing Pitt its ﬁrst
national cham-
pionship. These
ideas, may become a reality later
this month when the nation's best
swimmers compete at Princeton,
N.J.

, Unknown Freshman Helps
The only time that the Panthers
even scored in the nationals was
“in 1938 when they garnered two
points. Of this year’s squad which
will be gunning for national hon-
ors, Grady says, “Things have
changed so that the 1939 team
«wouldn’t rate a Chinaman’s chance
with this year’s outﬁt. It’s the
best balanced team that we have
ever had at Pitt.”
Strangely enough ‘Grady gives
a. lot of credit for Saturday’s
victory to an obscure freshman
Bob Furrer, who was just an‘-
other swimmer at Pitt—-that is
until the ECSA. Furrer, who
had no high‘school competition,
wasn_’t listed on the traveling
squad, so he paid his own way
to New York City to and moral
support. And that he did.
Young Furrer’s best time at the
YMHA pool in the 220-yard free

 

style event—2:55-was gained in
a practice session. At New York
he failed to quality but did the
220-yard distance in 2:29.

Last Minute Switch

sire of Furrer had the 14 members
of Pitt’s traveling squad pulling
for the young freshman. He adds,
“He unknowingly helped the Pitt
morale immensely. His perform-
ance, although in a losing effort,
was wonderful and all the boys
knew it.”

Incidentally, the meet was to
be reeled off at Lehigh, but on
last minute notice it was
switched to the New York pool.
It seems that Lehigh had previ-
ously scheduled a high school

. wrestling tournament, and since-

the gfllhtt-and-groan sport draws
big crowds in eastern Pennsyl-
vania, Lehigh oﬁicials declined
the swimming bid.

H a s t y communications with
Professor Frank Wall of the Vio-
lets’ Athletic‘ Committee brought
forth the solution. The modern
Quigley pool, used by NYU mer-
men, was slated for the ECSA
tournament. ‘

Too Bad—But

There was such a confusion that
the medals were sent to Lehigh
by mistake. But today a host of
Panther mermen are proud owners
of the awards which were picked
up late Saturday and taken to New
York for the presentation.

My only complaints are that
Pitt had to wait so long for a re-

Five Grapplers Await

W4

    4 rs; Title Hopes Dim

By DON SCHURMAN
Five of Rex Peery’s most able wrestlers make their ﬁrst

‘ their presence.
Grady said the gumption and de-

{post-season appearances this weekend in the Four-I tourna-
ment at Cleveland, but except for possible individual honors,
they might as well never don their¢

Blue-and-Gold tights.
As Coach Peery gloomily puts it,

~ . - “Because we are only entering ﬁve

of the team, we don’t stand a

chance of winning. We’d have-to

take ﬁve ﬁrst places to win.”
Records in Jeopardy

Although not impossible, this
would be quite a feat, especially
since a Pitt entry has never yet
been able to earn a first place tro-
phy in the Four I’s-—which, inci-
dentally, represents Interstate, In-
tercollegiate, Individual, Invita-
tional tournament.

Despite their lack of numbers,
however, Peery’s ﬁve matmen car-
ry some impressive individual-rec-
ords into the tourney. .

Hugh Peery, who will be com-
peting in the l17—pound class,
holds the longest winning streak
of the season, six consecutive
meets. He also has a 10-1 overall
record for the season.

Joe Solomon, (9-1-1) is unde-

feated in seven consecutive meets,
his only loss of the year being a
7-4 verdict to the National AAUP
champion.

NCAA Tourney Later

The other Pitt representatives
are Charley Uram (8-1-2), George
Matthews (7-4), and John George
(1-0).

From this select quintet, Coach
Peery will make his choices for

the NCAA tournament to be held

at Fort Collins, Colorado, on Mar.
28 and 29. -

Besides their preparations for
the -NCAA and the Four I’s, how-
ever, the matmen are also having
light workouts on the Olympic
wrestling rules. .

Heavyweight _Eldred Kraemer,
who is eligible for the Olympics,
became the ﬁrst oﬁicial entrant by
signing up last week for the Field
House tourney in April.

Civil A jumped-off to an 8-0
lead and led at the ‘end of the
ﬁrst quarter, 8-2.

However, the IE’s soon showed
They poured 14
points through the hoop in the sec-
ond stanza‘ to take a commanding
lead at half, 16-10. Civil A’s
downfall in the ﬁrst half was their
inability to capitalize on their
fouls. They converted only four
of twelve attempts.

In the following two periods, the
IE’s succeeded in ‘widening the

final quarter began. Civil A tried

But the IE’s, using the fast
break to good advantage, quickly
redeemed the lost points and went
on to triumph, 40-28. Jim Freed-
burg of Civil A was the game’s
high scorer with 13 markers and
Norm Williams led the victorious
IE’s with eleven.

The Pharmacy Mixers clinched
the Professional League basketball
championship in a low-scoring
contest at the Stadium by out-
pointing the Faculty Diehards, 29-
23. *

The Diehards have to be satisﬁed
with second-place honors as they
also dropped the ﬁrst game of the
proposed three game playoff to the
Mixers, 35-27, shaving it to a two
game playoff.

The teams were evenly matched
with a, slight score advantage

changing from team to teamt
throughout the contest. Although .

the Diehards held an 11-9 edge at
halftime, the Mixers exhibited
more endurance and pushed a

twelve point rally in the ﬁnal,

quarter to capture the victory and
championship.
Tom Baynham’s one handed

- push shot ‘from outside the key-

hole and the success of Fred Haus-
ler’s control of the backboards
were the main factors that carried
the Mixers to victory. Hausler,
along with Joe Liggett of the Die-
hards, took the high scoring hon-
ors with ten points apiece.
Liggett’s accuracy and the out-

M itterling’s OH ustlin g Rookies  
Keep Every Position Open

With’ the baseball opener
only three weeks away, a host
of determined rookies have
outfought Ralph Mitterling’s seven
lettermen to the extent of keeping
every position .a question-mark.

“This is one of the youngest
teams I’ve had in years,” says
Coach Mitterling. “As yet, every
position is open.”

Pitchers Galore

Perhaps the most secure posi-
tion is at ﬁrst base, where veter-
ans Bill Marhefka and Pat Murphy
are battling for starting assign-
ments. »

This is, however, the only posi-
tion, other than pitching with

more than one veteran candidate.

Among the pitchers, Mitterling
has letter-winners Paul Lomond
and Bob Russell, both of whom
hurl from the right side. At pres-
ent, the southpaw standouts ap-
pear to be Ray Hollis and Elmer
Guckert. ‘

Rago Third Baseman?

The most wide-open battles for
positions are at third base and in
the outﬁeld, both posts ﬁlled with
mostly rookie candidates.

Sam Rago, who saw little action
last year, is the strongest choice
for the hot corner though. Assist-
ant Coach Bobby Lewis says,
“Sam _is 100 per cent improved
over last year.”

Change in By-Laws To Give

Voice to Small Groups Pushed C ‘I

(Continued from Page 1)
base of representation could be
broadened.

Said Gardner: “A two house or-
ganization, with the lower house
having representatives from cam-
pus groups, might be desirable.
The upper house could remain
much as it is now, or could be al-
tered by not having many con-
gressmen elected at large as is
present practice.”

Picking Groups Problem

Another congressman, Jim Rock,
called the by—laws change “a ﬁne
idea, better than a pep club in pro-
moting school spirit.” Rock said
he was “worried” because of dif-
ﬁculty in deciding how to pick
the groups which should have rep-
resentatives.

PHILIP MORRIS I5
ENTIRELY FREE OF A
SOURCE OF IRRITATION

Phil Feinert, a Men’s Councvh
delegate, asserted‘ that the Chang
would create “a more representa-
tive setup than we have now.”

Some other suggested results (I
the by-laws change were:

(1) An increase in respect for
Congress by the administration,
and thus a stronger voice in uni-
versity life, because of its mort
representative nature.

(2) The possibility of less free-
swinging campaigning at election
time, since most of the contest!
would be carried on within small
groups.

(3) A more powerful indepe~n- ’

dent movement, since coalitions of
free-lance office seekers would
have less chance of monopolizing
the ﬁeld, as they have in the past.
