Dr. Brashear, better known as “'f’a"'j
Brashear, addressed the students at:
the weekly convocation on last;
VVednesd9.y morning. A large crowd‘;
was present to hear Dr. Brashear, and:
at the conclusion of his speech gave;
him mostihearty applause. . ﬂ

Dr. Brashear started away back inl
the time before the present studenti,

how the present great observatory of‘
the University had its start and about
the great men that helped to build up
this department of the University and
make it famous.

Speaking of the start of the ob-
servatory, he said: “About five or six
men got together way back in the
early seventies to form a company to
start the observatory. They had no
great aims then like we have now.
Things that we do now, they never
even dreamed. They wanted to raise;

about $8,000 to build a telescope, andi

they were so successful in their ef-
forts, getting about twice what they
expected, that they decided to start a
little observatory up on the hill where
W. U. P. used to stand. After a time
the observatory became part of the
University and then it went back

DEHBATERS AWAIT CONTESTS
A 4 ON FRIDAY NIGHT

 

- (Continued from Page 1)
a debate to Pitt.

However, the men

‘who are representing Pitt in the con-

tests this year say that there will be a
different story to tell when the ‘de-
bate is over ‘on Friday night. Wooster
is just as conﬁdent of winning an-
other debate from “Old Uni.” The
team from Wooster will beione of the
very best that has been turned out by
that institution in several years. Over

ﬁfty men turne_d out for the _teameat_

Wooster, which gave the coaches a
very large ﬁeld from which to pick
tight men for the two intercollegiate
contests this year.

One of the men that is coming on
the team that is to debate the Pitt
team won the Ohio State oratorical
contest last. year, defeating the best
man in Ohio Wesleyan University

whose men are considered among the1

best in this line ‘of work. However,
this fact only makes the men of our
own University work that much

harder to snatch this year’s contests
L from Pitt’s rivals.

captain the affirmative side. W. B. Con-
rad, ’14, Economics, and S. A. Shep-
ard, ’l5, College, will composethe rest
of the affirmative team.

H. R. Allison, ’l4, College, will lead.

the team against Allegheny atvMead-

ville. W. H. Colbert, ’l4, Economicsi

and]. G. Quick, ’l4, Economics, are
the other two members of this team.
Prof. Fish, when interviewed by a

Weekly reporter, gave out the follow-it

ing statement:

“Our men stand an excellent chance
of winning. Theyhave been working
almost daily since the first of Janu-
ary. At ﬁrst, there were about thirty
candidates out for places on the team.

So the six men. who will speak for,

Pitt on next Friday night are those
six who were able to withstand several
strong contests. Never before in the
history ‘of Pitt have so manymen
turned out for debate, and never be-

fore has such steady work been done?

' “Whether our men win.,or not, they

n will give their opponents a strong run

for their money, and after all this is
the great thing. And they certainly
will ﬁght until the last chance is gone.
They are ready. They are full of the
question. They are dead in earnest.
They are bound to win if they can.‘

“We are ready.i_ We will do our
best. Let .the best teams win.”

 

ESPERANTO CLUB MEETS.

 

The Pitt Esperanto Club held its
last meeting Monday evening in Thaw
Hall. Mr. I. M. Clifford had charge
of the class. The regular order of
the evening was considered. There
are now seven members and every one
is gaining rapidly in the new lan-
guage.

Mr. Khanna, the president has in--
vited everyone interested in the study
of languages in the movement for in-

ternational peace, or in anythi-n'g« of

an international character, to join this
club, as the results so far have been
instructive and interesting.

University. The success of any team
re-presenting the University depends
upon the conﬁdence and support
given the men on the team by the
student body. A most praiseworthy
move was made by the cheer leader
in making the effort to start the cus-
tom of welcoming each team upon its

return from a trip into foreign terri, '

tory. But much as the cheer leaders

are to be congratulated, the students‘

need take no praise to themselves.

The small number who were present-

showed the extreme interest which a
larg part of the student body display

in such an effort.’ The student-bodv'

certainly ‘deserves great credit for the
wonderful showing it made last Mon-
day—about one-ﬁfth of the students
present. So, unusual a_ state of inter-

If so large a num-
ber of men can not ﬁnd sufficient time
to attend such a mass meeting, they
had better cease to knock others for
the lack of interest which they dis-
play in student activities. Some steps
should certainly be taken at once to
prevent such a small attendance at
any mass meeting in the future.

 

EXAMINATIONS.

The change made by the faculty in
the system of examinations will cer-
tainly meet with approval from the
great majority of the student body.
Any method which will rem-ove the
necessity for the student taking ﬁve
or six tests in one day will be at the
very least an improvement upon the
present system. In meeting the re-
quest ofthe students that some rem-
edy be tried, the faculty have un-
doubtedlytakven a popular step. It is
of course to be expected that under

Eability to be an editor in fact, ‘and this

Why does the student body have to
elect editors of the Pit? VVeekly? Do
they elect the members of the foot-
{ball team? Both the Weekly staff and
lthe football team should be on the
same basis, for in each instance -the
positions to be attained shculd be
granted to those men sliow-ingi the
most ability during the time in which
they are given a trial. Suppose the
football team were selected by the

{student body instead of by the foot-

gball coach, who knows the game and

son What kind of a paper can be
expected if the men selected to nm
the pa-per are selected without regard
to ability or without any previous
training to amount to any thing in
newspaper work?

I have talked to several big news-
paper men in the city and all have
made the same reply in regard to the
competitive system, namely, that the
competitive system is the onlvway to
make the Pitt Weekly or any other
paper a success. No paper can be
run, -they all say, by politics and fra-
ternities and have any permanent suc-
cess. A ncw staff every year. elected
by politics and without anv regard to
ability, or without any system of train-
ing‘ men up to the position, can not
make any deﬁnite progress at all.

But some one says that_the competi-
tive system will make the paper go
still deeper into politics than at pres-
ent. This is not true, for the work of
each man each week will be given
over to -the Instruttbr of English in
the University and he will judgethe
ability of ‘the men, just as the coach
in football judges the work of the
men on the football squad. A ﬁle with

CLASS or JOURNALISM

 

H. P. Laufman, ﬁnancial editor of
the Pittsburgh Leader, gave a very
interesting and instructive talk to‘ the
students of the Journalism Class on
Monday evening. The subject"whiEh
he chose was: ,“The Work and Pas-
time of a New-paper Man.”

Mr. Laufman prefaced his lecture
by saying that he found recreation in
his work. He believes the newspaper

he is in touch with all. of life’s plhases
ranging from comedy to tragedy.
Some of the points which he gave
the class were: Keep your head; keep
cool:‘ use strategy: specialize and be-
come an authority on some subject:
develop a strong body; do notexpect
the city editor to do your work; read
the paper on which you are employed
along with other papers; read the ad-
vertisements aswell as the news‘

write natural: shun‘ atfectation; be :2

The Gold and Blue basketball toss-
ers returned after a hardctrip to the
East last Sunday, and reported that
while the trip was. not a hu-ge suc-
cess‘ so far as victories were con-
cerned, it was successful in every
other respect. The games were not
lost by inferior playing, in every case
as the players were tired from travel
and 0 continued playing and were
forced to ﬁght the enemy “in his ‘own
backyard” in everyicase, which is a
decided disadvantage. The floor at
Gettysburg is about the “size of a
hen coop,” as some of_t7he players ex-
pressed it and several times a basket
was made from the opposite end ‘of
the floor. At Albright ‘ the electric
system in the gymnasium was out of
working order andthe four oil lan-

terns pla-ced in the rafters did not give 1

enough -light to allow the enemy to
be ‘distinguished from one’s .own

The players, accompanied by Coach
Flint and Manager MacQuown, left
late Sunday night, arriving at Gettys-
burg Monday. They visited the his-
toric battleﬁeld in the afternoon and
enjoyed a pleasant time until dinner

Basketball Team Is Given Rousing

 

Welcome on Return.

At the end of chapel hour last Mon-
iday morning there was a..mass meet-
%ing held on the steps of Thaw Hall
lto give .-1 welcome to our basketball
team which had just come back from
a ten days’ trip in the East. A large
number of students attended the meet.‘
ing, but not as many as should have
‘been there considering the occasion.
However, those’w‘ho were there did
some splendid cheering when called
upon. After a cheer for the team
Walter Campbell, captain of the
team, said a few words, telling of the
splendid spirt the fellows showed all
the time and the courteous treatment
the team received at the hands of the
other schools and the referees. “VVe
did our best and we are not going to
say anything except that we were
beaten squarely’; and fairly when we
were beaten and that we won squarely
and fairly."

‘ There were cheers given for the
{track men present who had partici-
pated in the meet at the P. A. A. Di-
rector Miller was spied in the crowd
and was brought out before the stu-
dents to make a speech. He said
that this year we had done three good
things for ‘the basketball team:

Quown was chosen manager, and

In the next game at Swarthmore
Pitt received a decisive‘ defeat and
blames the” loss of the game chiefly to
the fact that the E-astern team is big-

ing guard, Frishman, weighs only 115
pounds and is under 5 l-2 feet-quite
a difference. ‘Gilchrist, the Swarth-

tossed 11 out of 11 fouls. He is one

A TENNIS STARTED._

 

The tennis team has started work
under the tutelage of Prof. G. W.
Postgate and much interest and en-
thusiasm has been aroused among the
candidates for the team. The ﬁrst
real work started last night when the
coach gave an exhibition match at the
P. A. A. club house. Several strokes
were taught the new men, and the
rudiments of the game were learned.
Practice will be held twice a week
until next fall.

hour later after the fellows had had
time to rest up and McKinney took
the lead at the crack of the pistol and
was not passed during the entire dis-
tance. Hazlett kept right at his heels
until near the ﬁnish when he was
passed by two men. While McKin-

ney does not possess much speed he
