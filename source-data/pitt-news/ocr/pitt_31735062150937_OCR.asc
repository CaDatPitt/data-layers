Pitt Players

Open Season

Will Present “He Who
Gets Slapped”

When the whispered call of
“Curtain!” is heard backstage of
the Y. M. & W. H. A., auditorium
next Thursday evening and the
new cyclorama drop is rung up on
the ﬁrst act of “He Who Gets
Slapped,” a four-act play by Leon-
id Andreyev, Pitt Players , will
have oﬁicially opened another sea-
son of campus dramatic activity.
Director Carl B. Cass has prom-
ised an 8:15 o'clock curtain.

The setting for the play is the
lounging room of a permanent cir-
cus located on the outskirts of a
large French city.

Ticket sale under the new ex-
change plan is promising, accord-
ing to Director Cass who said:

‘Ticket sale, so far, is the heavi-
est it has ever been, and in the
majority of cases the students are
taking advantage of the exchange
value of their activities books."

Under the new plan, ticket No. 7
in the activities book, together
with ﬁfty cents, may be exchanged
for a season ticket for all three
of the Players’ productions this
year.

 

Whltlach, Has Lead.

The part’-of “He” is taken in the
Playeig’ production by Gene Whit-
lach, 01. ’32, president of the club
and the author of a prize-Winning

one-act play which he wrote last

season. ‘‘He,’’ a cultured gentle-
man whom Fate has handled un-
kindly, comes to the circus man-
aged by one Briquet, played by
Walter Henderson, Ed. ’32.

Briquet hires the despondent
outsider, and promptly bills him
as “He Who Gets Slapped,” a
clown in the circus company. “He”
endeavors to save Consuelo, a bare-
back rider and the queen of the
circus, from the attentions of the
Baron Regnard, a scoundrel ~ who
is bargaining with -Consuelo’s
father for her love. Adelaide Hun-
ter, Col. ’32, who will be remem-
bered for her work last year in
"Alice-Sit-by-the-Fire,” plays the
part of the naive young equestri-
enne. The part of Baron Regnard

The attempts of .“He” to per-

, There is an old saying and a true
one that life is not in holding a
good hand, but in playing a poor
hand well. It
can be_ para-
phrased very ef-
fectively. Life is
not in playing
well ‘when the
team is winning
———in doing your
best when skies
are bright -—— in
grinning when
theibreaks come
your way. Life
is in cracking a
leg, if neces-
sary, when the

equally, and the breaks terrible.

Cadets to Dance With Pitt. Coeds
At Season’s Most Brilliant Event

0 The Army arrives-the war is
on. After the battle. . . .

Twelve hundred stately cadets
march into the ball-room. Co-eds
eagerly "await a glimpse of the
“cream of American youth.” The
orchestra strikes up——blue uniforms

ing gowns. The dance goes on.
Partners change rapidly; the S0“
shades of the shimmering satins
and velvets blend with the blue and
gold of the cadet dress uniforms.
Suddenly a hush steals over the
crowded room. The United States
Military Choir lift their voices in
song—songs in tribute to their
team, to their school, and to Pitts-
burgh. 0
Again the orchestra plays——a
snappy foxtrot. Confusion in the
doorway! The “Hellcats” rush in
with their ﬁfe and drum corps.

Literary Number Offers
Student Prose, Poetry

 

The Pitt Panther’s
Number appears on the campus
Monday. ,

It ‘marks the ﬁrst appearance
of a literary publication on the
campus for two years. The editors,
sensitive to the needs of Pitt stu-

dents, departed from their accus-l
tomed humorous publication and:

have devoted the issue exclusively‘, ..

to purely literary composition. Thei
Literary Number, besides naving§
the distinction of being the largest:
literary magazine published on the;
Pitt campus, will also be the ﬁrstf
illustrated one. Illustrations will;
be black and white pen sketches. E

Hiram H. Howard, chairman of;
The Pitt: Panther. says “We feel
that we have collected the best;
prose and poetry available from‘
purely student sources on such
short notice. We have had no large
stocks of student themes, essays,’
and poetry to draw upon and have;
used only voluntary student contrl-V’
butions in presenting a magazine
of live artistic material of particu-
lar interest to Pitt students.”

On Parking

Campus Driveways Must

Machines parked on any of the
campus driveways tomorrow will
be tagged by city police, according
to an announcement made this
week by‘tl1e office of the dean of
men. University Drive will be
posted with “No Parking” notices
tomorrow morning and the police
department has notiﬁed the Uni-
versity administration that it will
cooperate in keeping the drives
free of parked vehicles. The ex-
pected heavy traﬂic for the Pitt-
Army game is the reason for the
action taken by the school.

A campaign against parking on
the sharp curve near the Upper
Dental building and on the drive-
way before the entrance to Alumni
Hall is also being waged by the
administration. The oﬁicepof the

dean of men is asking students to
cooperate with the University in
this measure so that accident haz-
ards may be removed from the
drive. ‘ . .

Coed Silence
Ends Tonight

Panliel Expects Decrease
In Number of Pledges

 

 

 

“The depression makes it impos-
sible this‘ year to compare the
actual value of Bid Day with the
formal rushing period,” says Miss
Helen P. Rush, Women’s activities
head, as seventeen Women’s frater-
nities await the results shown in
the bid lists which they will re-
ceive at 9:00 o’clock tonight at the
University Club. “The complete
substitution of a Bid Day for rush-
ing would be, however, the ulti-
mate ideal of free association
which is now in an almost experi-
mental state, although it has been
so successful at Pitt.” .

Comparatively few women are
expected to join fraternities this
fall, although Miss Rush urges
freshman women to make their de-
cisions without waiting for the. per-
fect fraternity, an organization
which does not exist. “There
would be no value in joining an ab-
solutely perfect organization," she
says, “Because problems make the
fraternity, and its worth lies in
teaching its members to cope with
its problems.”

Panhellenic will cooperate with
other campus organizations in the
Welfare Drive, and Mildred Leveri-
son, Panhellenic president, urged
at the Panhellenic Council meet-
ing last week, that all fraternity
women contribute to the fund.

Panhellenic Council is also plan-
ning to sponsor a Panhellenic Con-
ference Week late this month, dur-
ing which women's fraternity prob-
lems on campus will be discussed.

Pro and Can of ‘Aﬂﬁliation

EDITOR'S NOTE:——In connection with the current rushing season,
[The Pitt Weekly prints opinions of fraternity and non-affiliated men

. . , . _ prominent on campus with the end that from the diversity of opinion
blues to gwe the may Its true qua} {something of beneﬁt may be gleaned by those contemplating the fra-

ternity question.

Eddie Hirshberg, captain of the
Pitt football team, marks out the
province of fraternity:

“Fraternities, it seems to me,
gratify the social and gregarious
instincts of -the undergraduate. For
the freshman who needs com-
pvalnionship, social activities and
contacts, and a more realistic mani-
festation of college spirit, I strongly
advise affiliation with a fraternity
of his own choosing." .

Gene Whitlatch, president of Pit
Players, observes: ,
“Fraternities often create lasting

friendships that are invaluable. It
serves as an outlet for social ex-
pression. But I do not believe it is
necessary for me to join a select
group to acquire the social contacts
and pleasures desired. One doesn't
have to join a fraternity to make
the friendships of even fraternity
men.”

John J. -Smoyer, associate editor
of the Pitt Weekly, evidences a.
skeptical attitude:

“The ﬁnancial obligations, it
seems to me, are not compensated
by the social benefits derived. I
have peace in the knowledge that
I have reached my present position
in campus activities -without the
aid or encumbrances of maternity."

Hiram H. Howard, chairman of
-the Pitt Panther, takes a purely
ustilitarian standpoint:

“For men away from home, a
good fraternity is probably the bes=t
solution of the housing problem.
The question of affiliation is -an
individual problem. For those men
who are social and congenial, will-
ing -to co-operate with others, and
can afford it, fraternity is usually a
good thing. I do not think a man
should join a fraternity if he is
going to. Pitt on a closely ﬁgured
budget. A fnalternl-ty, in the last
analysis, is a luxury and should be
consid-ered as such."

‘Steps’ to Appear Again
After Two Year Absence

 

Steps, campus literary magazine,
will apear on the campus again
sometime in the next month after
an absence of two years. Steps was
published last in December 1929.

The new issue, which is being
svponzsored by the English depart-
ment, will contain .s«ho=r_t stories, pove-
try and other literary features. The
editorial and business staffs will be
announced in the near future.

 

Checking System Planned
To Stop Thievery at Gym
A checking system designed to

protect the valuables of the stu-
dents in Trees Gym, is being rap-

idly worked out and will be put-

into operation in the very near fu-
ture, according to Reed Rose, Dent.
’32, chairman of the investigating
committee of Student Council.
Although all the details of the
plan have not been worked out as
yet, Rose has been conferring with
Professor John Dambach, director
of physical education, and it'has
been found that the plan in es-
sence is feasible. Council has ap-
proved of the checking system as
submitted, and Rose is ﬁnishing
the few details before -the new
improvement is put into operation.

Daniel J. Butler, Bus. Ad. ’32,
president of Sigma Alpha Epsilon
expressed that: ‘

0 “Education, as I understand it, is
not mere intellectuality, but alsubtle
something which develops true in-
dividuality. In the fraternity house,
the student acquires something
that classroom and activities deny
him. There he may ‘he himself’.'’

Frank A. Goodfellow, Bus. Ad.
’32, Phi Delta Theta president of
Interfraternity "Council, stated:

“It is my ﬁrm conviction that the
associations and companionships of
a. select group have .a broadening
inﬂuence which cannot be obtained
in the classroom. I further believe
that the utility of fmlternities at
Pitt is enhanced since the Univer-
sity is located in a large city.”

W. Eugene Pry, Bus. Ad. '32.
Phi Gamma. Delta, former presi-
dent of Interfraternity Council,
said:

“When joining a. fraternity I took
into consideration the many bene-
tits I would receive. One of the
finest is that of friendships which
continue years after graduation.
Another beneﬁt is received from
living in intimalte contact with
other men. A ﬁnal point is the
training which the fraternity man
receives in leadership, responsibil-
ity, and social activity.” ‘

S. Allen Vatz, Col. '32, president
of Phi Epsilon Pi, remarked:

“As a freshman, fraternity life
loomed as one phase of my univer-
sity experience that would afford
me opportunity to come in contact
with, likes, dislikes, backgrounds
and ambitions similar to mine. I
looked forward to gaining from the‘
fraternity that intimate knowledge
which would add human interest to
the facts gleamed from the class-
room. I have not been disap-
pointed."

Richard L. Phif-er, Bus. Ad. '32.
Theta Delta Psi Business Manager,
Owl, had the following to say:

“In the fnaternity I joined, I
found that men had the same likes,
dislikes. and ideals I held. I had
learned from others who were fra-
ternity men that a fraternity will
enrich and broaden those chosen to
membership. The outstanding ap-
peal of the fraternity to me was
that it provided a smalll intimate

by Dr. E. M. Frost, director of the
student health service, at the reg-
ular meeting of Student Council,
last week.

Dr. Frost outlined a. plan which
would provide an adequate ‘ de-
partment for the development of
preventive and, remedial health
measures in the interest of every
student enrolled at Pitt.

Features ’of the plan proposed
by Dr. Frost included the creation
of a full-time health department

the University administration and
by a fee placed upon all students.

Dr; Frost stated that be sub-
mitted the proposed plan after he
had conducted, a survey of health
facilities offered by 15 leading ur-
ban colleges, similar in size and
location, All of these schools were
fount to maintain full-time health
services and operated from a. gen-
eral student fee set aside for this
purpose.

Altjwugh Dr. Frost detailed his
plan to members ‘of Council, he

with a staffdof qualiﬁed physicians, xstressed the fact that it was not

Fans Await
Pitt-Cadet
A Grid__I3attle

(Continued From Page One.)

Coalch 'Sasse’s men have been
drilling in forward passes during
the greater part of the week in or-
der to -strike the Panther defense
at its lone weakness. With the ex-
ception of one touchdown made by
Notre Dame, all scores against Pitt
have been made via the aerial
route.

-Cadet Aerial Attack.

It is the Cadets’ hope that the
Pitt line will be so spread out in
order to combat this type of offense
that if their -aerial work is stopped,

4 they can senldl Ray sS'-tecker, their
backﬁeld ace through the line.

Stecker ﬁrst sprang into promi-
nence last year when he made a
long run to score the lone touch-—

, down in the game against Navy
and continued to shine during the
past basketball season. He is a
Pennsylvania "boy residing at Hazle-
ton, and will probably have ‘many
supporters in the crowd.

Another West Point player whom
fans are anxious to see is Jack
Price. the captain and -left tackle.
He was mentioned on several all-
American teams last year and has
been playing the same steady ball
this year. _ He will wear the num-
ber 17 jersey, while Stecker Will
-dlon a number 18.

The visitors will lineup with
Kopscak and King at ends, Price
and.Suarez at tackles. T.-rice and
Summerfelt at guards, and Lazar
at center. In the backﬁeld they will
have Carver at quarterback, Steck-
er and ‘Fields at the halves, and
Kilday at fullback.

Pitt will start the same team
which took the ﬁeld for the opening
kickoff against Carnegie Tech last
week. Captain Hirshberg and Col-
lins will be at the ends, Quatse and
MacMurdo at the tackles, On-der
and iMilllgan at the guards, and
Daugherty in the center. Hogan
will again call signals, Clark will
do the plunging, and Reider and
Heller will .skirt the ends and dash
off tackle.

Morris, Luch in Shape.

According to reports, Hart Mor-
ris and} Johnny Luch who were not
in the best of condition for the Car-
negie game, -have recuperated from
their recent injuries and will be
ready for duty when called upon.
The presence of these two men
gives Pitt a ‘big break, as their ex-
perience will make them valuable
as, replacements for the starters.

The probable outcome of the
game is hard to ﬁgure due to the
difference in the schedule of the
«two teams and the mental condi-
-‘tion in which the men enter the

, game. Pitt played below form in
its tilt with the Tartans; and! un-
less it shows a reversal of form

- tomorrow, it may suffer its second
defeat of the current season.

The writer, however, leans to-
ward Pitt, whom he ﬁgures to win
by a 21-6 score. Army should

 score one touchdown ‘by a forward
:;,.*.- pass. He believes that the Panth-

ij ere‘ will nullify this by scoring one

 of their own on an

intercepted
pass. And that Pitt ilorward pass-
ing attack is not so bad, either.

Omega Delta

Wins Tourney

Whit aker, Meyers Star
In Greek Meet

 

Omega Delta, by virtue of a vic-
tory over Alpha Phi Delta, won
the In»terfi'aternity horseshoe tour-
nament sponsored by the Pitt
Weekly on November 10.

Play Three Games

It took exceptional pitching on
the part of Darrel Whitaker and
Bill-,1 Meyers to defeat Magrinaro
and Castanzo in three hard-fought
games. The ﬁrst game found the

lpha Phi Delt’s leading by a
.5-1 score only to lose 25-20; in the
second game Alpha Phi Delta won
handily, 26-17; in the last, and
hardest fought game, Alpha Phi
Delta, afteritiliiling the Omega
Delt’s 13-3, tied the game 15 all,
but the rally failed. In the three
games played, the two teams
scored thirty-three ringers.

In the upper bracket of the semi-
ﬁnals, Omega Delta defeated Sig-
ma. Alpha Epsilon after losing the
ﬁrst game; in the lower bracket
Alpha Phi Delta came from behind
to defeat the Phi Eps, after losing
the first game 25-23. Goldstein
played well for the losers.

Present Cup “

The championship cup presented
by the Pitt Weekly will be award-
ed the winners at the next meeting
of interfraternity council at the
Alpha Phi Delta house on Novem-
bar 1. At the same time, Theta
Chi will be awarded a cup for win-
ning the mushball tournament
-which was also sponsored by the
Pitt Weekly.

Corr Speeds

Hanna Shows Fine Form
In Early Workouts

Coach Pat Corr is well satisﬁed
thus far with the performances of
the members of the swimming
squad. The men have been improv-
ing steadily, taking their work
seriously and practicing assiduous-
Iv

 

 

This past week, the swimmers
practiced on the zgruelling four-
hundred-and-forty-yard swim and
went through the tough event in
great shape, considering the earli-
ness of the season. The boys will
probably swim a longer distance
next week. Thus, by increasing the
length of the trial swims every
week, the svdimmers should grad-
ually gain the stamina and endur-
ance necessary for the middle of
the season.

Led by Schmieler and Patton, co-
captains, the Pitt team is looking
forward to an undefeated or near
undefeated season. The Pitt boys
are generally of a high calibre
with several stars standing out.
Jack H.an'nV'a especially looks like
a sure bet to cop most of his
events this year.

Visiting Team Is Favorite
In Lone Match On
Opponents’ Field

0

Pitt’s varsity cross - country
team faces one of its toughest as-
signment ofthe season tomorrow
morning when it meets .the Cadets’
hill and dalers over the Schenely
Park course. This meet is the only
one which the Cadets are permit-
ted to have away from West Point
this year.

Army will be a heavy favorite to
win, due to its ﬁne showing
against West Virginia last week
in which the Cadets won, 27-28.
West Virginia holds a victory over
the Panther harriers this year by
a 17-28 score.

Clise, Allen Duel

The visitors’ line-up will be com-
posed of C. K. Allen, D. S. Camp-
bell, Slade, Skidmore, Kern. Ryan,
Wortham, Clark, and W. R. Smith.
Thesepmen have been running in
the order named during the great-
er part of the season.

The feature of the meet in all
likelihood! will be the duel between
John Clise, ace of the Pitt team,
and Allen for the number one
place. Clise ﬁnished third in the
Pitt-West Virginia meet, while
Allen also ~’ placed third in his
school’s match with the Moun-
taineers. -

This meet is the third this sea-
son for the Pitt men against pure-
ly Eastern opposition. Penn State
and Syracuse were met previous-
ly; and the schedule also included
meets with Allegheny and the
Mountaineers, .two district teams.
Pitt’s one remaining contest is
with Carnegie Tech which will be
held next Saturday.

Pitt Teams Win

The Panther varsity and fresh-
man teams ﬁnished ﬁrst and sec-
ond, respectively, in the annual
A. M. A. cross-country champion-
ships last week and thus added
two more trophies to the already
large collection on hantl.

Frank Cerny won ﬁrst place and
was followed closely across the ﬁn-
ish line by Clise of the varsity and
Wagenhouser of the freshmen. The
victory for the varsity over the
fresh was somewhat of a surprise,
as the first year men had been
displaying real form throughout
the season as evidenced by their
victory over the strong Penn State
cub team and many fans had ﬁg-
ured them stronger than the var-
sity.

CLOSEST AND BEST

FOR PITT STUDENTS

A brilliant ninety-yard run from

' kick-off by Nicks-ich in the «ﬁrst

quarter enabled a game Pitt frosh
eleven to end its season with :3.
tie with Kiski, 6-6.

The Pitt cubs had been rated
the underdogs in their invasion of
the powerful Kiski team, but the
little Panthers showed the real
stuff by turning back the. deter-
mined Kiski threats whenever nec-
essary. After Pitt had tied the
score, the prep school eleven men-
aced the Panther goal line, but
Pitt held every time. '

e Win -Three Tilts

The little Panthers had a rea-
sonably successful season, winning
three, tieing two, and losing one.
West Virginia was the only eleven
to take the measure of the Pitt
frosh, winning 12-0. The two ties
were played with Carnegie Tech
and Kiski. the former ,game’s score
being 0-0 and the latter’s 6-6, as
described above.

There are quite a few compli-
cations connected with the games
played between Pitt, West Vir-
ginia, Tech, and Kiski. Pitt played

major games than its record might
indicate.
Overwhelm State

Pitt scored victories over Wyom-

Washington and Jefferson. In its
game against Penn State, the frosh
clicked better than at any other
time -in the season, overwhelming
the Nittany, 33-O.

Ormiston, lightning guard, was
a former all-scholastic fullback in
Pittsburgh, but was switched to
guard at Kiski, from which he
graduated last year. His playing
has been inspiring all season and
he was the backbone of the line.

Cry “Win ’Em All”

It seems that “Doc” Carlson
does not mean “Win ’Em All’’ as
an idle jumble of wo1’ds. Besides
having the phrase written on the
walls of the dressing room as a
continual reminder always before
them, the squad has received an-
other gentle reminder in the form
of a brass check the size of'a sil-
ver dollar.

This check made its appearance
after the Carnegie Tech game last
Saturday, with the advice of:
“Don’t spend it all at one time.”

very clear letters. It seems that

away for long spectacular runs.

Entrants for Swim Meet
Must Attend Practices

An interclass swimming meet
sponsored by W. A. A. will be held
on Friday, December 4, at 3:30
o’clock at Trees’ Pool. Events will
be for speed, form, and diving.

Each class may enter no more
than two participants in each
event except the relay which re-
quires tovur. Each person may en-
ter no more than four events and
diving.

The events include: 40-yard free.
style, breast stroke, and back
stroke, and 80-yard free-style, form
swims in side stroke and trudgeon,
plunge for distance, diving, and
an 80Lyard shu’ttle relay.

All participants are required to
have at least eight’ practices be-
fore the meet. Anyone interested
may sign up at the gym.

Cub Basketball Coach‘
Cuts Size of Squad

 

With the return of the varsity
to regular p-raqctice, Paul Zehfuss
frosh basketball mentor, has been
forced to limit his squad to work-
ing size. As a result, there is a
group of only eight or ten differ-
ent freshmen out each night. In
this way, Zehfuss will get a good
line on all his material, as his men
are svcrimmaging with the varsity
men.

Many of the yearling aspirants
have found the grind different
from that of high school basket-
ball. Working in a system such as
here at Pitt is vastly different
from
ployed by _most high school aggre-
gations.

Individualism .does not exist in
the Pitt system. The men work to
late hours and ﬁnd the competi-
tion much keener. The intricacies
of Carlson system has kept the
freshman candidates -on their toes
at all times.

ment of ten men to the sports

Meet Nov. 23

John Hopkins U. First
Foe For Riﬂemen

 

The varsity riﬂe team is look-
ing forward anxiously but conﬂ-
dentiy to the ﬁrst meet of the sea-
son with Johns Hopkins Univer-
sity the week of November 23. If
the squad keeps up its good work,
it should give a very good account
of itself in this shoot and improve
as the season progresses. Pros-
pects of a successful season are
very bright.

When asked what he thought ‘of
this year’s team, Captain Backen
stated, “I think that we have some
ﬁne material from which to build
a team. It would be a great sur-
prise to me if we should not enjoy
a season as good as last year.

“To tell the truth, I believe this
season will be even better than
last season. But you can take this
from me: we shall feel the loss of
Hempel keenly. Hempel was ca.p-
tain of last year's team, and twice
won ﬁrst place in the Intercol-
legiate Riﬂe Matches. No team
can lose a man like that and not
suffer from the loss.

_ Captain High Scorer

Backen did not .mention, how-
ever, that he was runner-up to
Hempel on both occasions upon
which the exwaptain V won first
place. .

“Considering everything,” Back-
en continued, “I think that the
present team has an advantage
over any of the past. Tobegin
with, we have a riﬂe range at our
disposal this year which we_ did
not have until late last season.
Another thing, the material we
have on hand is, on the whole,
more experienced than that of
other seasons. Yes, I think the
riﬂe team will have a good season.
At the least, it will compare fa-
vorably with past seasons.

Backen’s Last Year

This ‘is Backen’s.third and last
year on the riﬂe -squad, and his
ﬁrst as captain of the -team. Much
is expected of Captain Backen and
Wilson, both of whom are serving
their last year.

School. The program is under
the direction of H. C. Pavian,
instructor in aeronautical en-
gineering.

Section 35 in the Stadium
has been reserved for the 1250
students who have trained the
past few weeks for the various
subjects. They will depict'sev-
eral characters, including the
Army mule and the Pitt pan-
ther. All students who have
not received instructions in re-
gard to the stunt have been
requested to stay out of the
reserved space. Appropriate
colored cardboard will be used
in place of crepe paper.

If the display is a success it
is planned to use the students
trained this year as a nucleus

for the entire student body in
such a demonstration next
season. .

it that prevails here.

to be the most colorful occasion
.,0l1‘dI Father Pitt has seen in
many a day. From the time the
. cadets march from their train
until the last strain of harmony
has died away at the brilliant
ball tomorrow night, the day
will be endowed with a round
of thrills and spectacles. The
beautiful rhythmic precision of
the corps as it goes through its
demonstration on the ﬁeld, the
glamour of 1,500 sleekly uni-
formed men, and the expected
rivalry between the two -teams
are _all features that may be
calculated to make tomorrow
a. complete success.

Pittsburgh in general and the

only be signally honored by the
visit of the corps. ‘May its -stay.

‘Literary Pan th er

E PITT PANTHER, camp-

us humorous publication,
has shown real courage and en-
terprise in making its forth-
coming issue one devoted IGIXF
clusively t-o articles of an ar-
tistic style. The magazine is
thus meeting the demands -of
a small group of students» who
found no medium for the out-
let of their literary efforts. At

. the same time, the Panther has

shown initiative in being the
ﬁrst- college humor publication
to recognize the other side of

writing.
The issue may not attain
any great rhetorical perfec-

tion but it will certainly be
representative of the students’
efforts, uninﬂuenced by faculty
opinion or suggestions. The
Panther deserves applause for
its experiment which will un-
questionably be an interesting
one. .

Pitt Players

 

HE SEASON for Pitt Play-
ers officially opens next
Wednesday evening when “He
Who Gets Slapped” will be pre-
sented. Here is an activity
deserving of unstintled student
-support, but one which rarely
receives anything like its share
of campus backing.

Although -working under the
obvious difficulty of poor equip-
ment and lack of stage facili-
ties, yet the Players have be-
come one of the most promi-
nent dramatic groups in col-
lege.‘ circles. The type of
their productions. as well as the
polish of their performance,
has demonstrated their contin-
ued progress.

This advancement has been
achieved without the -support of
the student body. With that
support, Pitt Players could
probably go even further. And
if you think that Cap and Gown
is the only dramatic activity
on the campus, you will be
pleasantly awakened should
you dnoip in on the Players’
production next week.

To the Editor of
Weekly: .
Pitt men have become style

conscious. Since a. campaign
was started last year to make
the male student-body dress
with more care, -the appearance
of our students has improved
greatly.

Recently there have been
rumblings from men on the
campus that have come to a

. crash with the printing of a

letter signed I. D. R. In an-

swer to you I. D. R. I wish to

say -that we who stand f-or a

well dressed student body can-

not see how your suggestions
can take effect at Pitt.

We aren’t in a position to
“go native.” Wearing cordu-
roys, sweaters and hip boots

cannot be tolerated in a big
"city school. Schools like Dart-
mouth and Penn State can get
- by with most informal dress be-
cause of the fact that they are
not situa-ted in a large commun-
ity. They are off by themsel-
ves in a collegiate wilderness.

The fact remains that the
boys from dear old Dartmouth
and Penn State are -sartorially
minded. Week-ends ﬁnd them
in the big cities “dressed to
kill." One of the most popular
events at both of these univer-
sities is their annual best dress-
ed men’s contest.

You say I. D. R. that students
can save much money by dress-
ing in the most informal man-
ner, and by not dressing up. Do
you realize that to be well .
dressed does not necessarily
mean that you have to wear th
most expensive clothes and ac-
cessories? As long as you ap-
pear neat and meticulous and
Your accessories ﬂatter or at

, least do you justice you will be
considered well groomed.

To the Editor of Pitt Weekly:
‘ As college students, for four
years set apart from the
“world, we havean unusual op-
portunity to investigate critic-
ally the soclal patterns and
the social systems we must
ultimately become a part of.
We give very little thought to
the ethical ;use of the time it
is our privilege to make the
most of. Friday afforded a
good example of our childish
adherence to out?/orn tradi-
tions.
At noon, about seventy stu-
dents listened to Kirby Page
speak on “Dollars and World
Peace.” But what was the rest
of the student body doing?
Making a great deal of noise,
creating much excitement
over a distinctly student activ-
ity: the honoring of the co-ed

haps none"‘of those participat-

ing the war sys'tem——probab1y
the ten newly. chosen girls
hadn't given its thought. .Yet
it amounts to.that precisely.
United States, in the. Kellogg-
Briand Pact, has gone on rec-
ord as renouncing war, but we
use subtle and popular de-
vices for preserving the ma-
chinery of war. Are college
vstudents as a group so ignor-
ant, or so stupid that, they
know not what they do?
Student public opinion is in
an alarmingly uninformed
state, despite our opportuni-'
ties to ﬁnd out truth, to face
realities, and to protest
against what we need not sup-
port. Leading authorities on
international policy insist that
the military system is danger-
ous and must be quickly
scrapped if the calamity of an-
other war/is to be averted.
Why don’t our campus leaders

Swiss Scribe Impressed
,By American College Life

Coming originally from Transyl-
vania, where Eastern and Western
European cultures meet, Mr. March-
bin is much impressed with the
assimilation of all cultures as
found in America. —He predicts that
within one hundred years. America
will have the most important cul-
ture of any country, since it will
be representative of all of them.
He states that a European uni-
versity is primarily a research in-
stitution, while the American uni-
versity is a social and cultural in-
stitution.

The graduate student” believes
that the American professor -is
over-worked, since he must pre-

-pare many more than the tradition-

al ﬁve lectures at week as in Eu-
rope. Also, according to Mr. March-
bin. the American students could
solve the most important problem
of the United States by helping to
eliminate race prejudice, and by
learning to understand those peo-
ple whom prejudice has taught
them to dislike. This Mr, March-
bin believes far more important
than economic depression.

As a ﬁnal contention, Mr. March-
bin holds the mental health of the
American student far higher than
that of the European student, since‘
the American student is not a poll-
tician. ' , , ‘

Howard R. Mayberry, assistant
professor of psychology, is the man
to see when you feel like “ending
it all.” His remedy for chasing the
blues (which isn’t suicide) makes
a college career a pleasure.

Advises the smiling professor,
“When your clouds are growing
heavier, approach your friend, if
you have any, pat him on the back
(pat him hard while you’re at it),
and enthuse joyfully, ‘Cheer up, old
pal, the earth is still rotating.’_ In
case you haven't any friend (and
it’s very possible in this dispirited
year of 1931) see me up 313 Alumni
and do the patting on my back.”

According to Professor Mayberry
this process is said to bring excel-
lent results. Once the “clouds”
leave you, they won’t come back
even if._you want them to.
