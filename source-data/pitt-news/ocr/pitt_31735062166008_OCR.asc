Midday Series

‘ Speaker Wins
,9 NAACP Cases

er,

Robert L. Carter, _who is
scheduled to- speak on “Dis-

crimination in the"North” at '

Friday’s Midday Series, has
won 17 of the 18 cases he has

argued” before the Supreme
Court. ’ '

Carter has worked in‘ the legal
department ‘of the NAACP since
1944‘and isnow General Counsel

“for the organization. He is a mag-
na cum laude graduate of Howard
Law School and a member of the
New-York Bar Association. ,.

In 1956 Carter argued "success-
fully, on the basis ofgfreedom of
association, that the state of Ala-
bama could not ﬁne the NAACP

for refusing to hand over its mem-

bership-list to the Estate. In 1960 he
got the Supreme Court to reverse
the conviction‘ ofthe NAACP in

f5Little Rock for not Adisclosing

‘membership lists to ‘the State of
Arkansas, and in. 1961 he won a
case against the ‘Arkansas-state
law ‘which required teachers to
list all affiliations.
Against Gerr-ymandering

In the Tuskegee .case he argued
against gerrymandering in Ala-
bama. The state legislature had
drawn a complex ﬁgure to prevent
the _large,. well-educated, _*Negro

5." population of Tuskegee College
and Veterans-Hospital from voting‘

in the local election, ac_cording to
Eric ‘Springer, ‘spokesman for the
NAACP, and assistantprofessor of
health law. .9 .

The Supreme Court upheld.
the NAACP argument to invali-
date the gerrymandering, even
though earlier decisions stated"
that the state governments ‘were
the ones who had legal jurisdic-
tion in determination of the dis-
tricting of the legislature.

ate organizations.”
‘ The letter came in- answer to a

' message sent to the Chancellor on
April 22 by Mrs. Jonas E. Salk, ,

chairman of the Commission.

In ‘the letter she accused the

Uni_versity of only reaﬁirming the

status quo,'rather than setting a .

standard for the entire University”
‘community.’ .

Mrs. Salk also stated that the
Commission believed that “the
University could have per-
formed a real community serv-
ice by assuming a leadership
role in withdrawing its support
of or affiliation with any or-‘
ganization which has a policy
of ' ‘discrimination.

The text of the Chancellor’s re-
ply folows:

Dear Mrs.’ Salk: --

I have your letter of April 22.
I am' happy that you approve of
the strong position against dis-
crimination which the University
has taken.
’I am afraid Ilquite disagree
with you"‘regarding the ‘Univer-

.sity’s responsibility as far as pri-

vate organizations are concerned.
There" is a very‘ fundamental
principle involved here. People
have theright to associate with
one another under such circum-
stances as‘they wish as ‘long as
they’ are maintaining private or-
ganizations. For the University
to exercise. its institutional posi-
tion" to attempt’ to inﬂuence the
way in which those people in their
private character choose to. asso-
ciate isto use the University for
a purpose which wouldjeopardize

Shelters for Fallout Only Dot
Campus; Part of Defense Effort‘

The falloutshelter signs which have_appeared on almost

all of the "buildings around the University are part of a ’

nationwide defense effort, according to Oren Relyea, Fire
Marshal and Safety Inspector here. _‘ _
The University, in cooperation with the Office of Civil

A Defense of Allegheny County and of Pittsburgh, and with the

Corps of United States Army'En-9

gineers is providing the use of
certain buildings as protection in
the event of attack.

The shelters are not bomb shel-

ters, he emphasized, but are to be
used for “protection from Gamma
radiation, which results from a
bomb explosion suﬂiciently far
enough away that there has been
no appreciable effects from blast
or thermal radiation.”
Defense Changing

According to Relyea, the de-
fensive plans of the United States
have been changing rapidly in the
last three or four years, so that
now the emphasis is largely on
protecting areas away from the
target center. This particular pro-
gram, sponsored by the Defense
Department, is in effect in cities

_ all over the United States.

(Continued from Page 1)

Picking the buildings to be
used as shelters began with the
local civilian defense. which
hired a private ﬁrm to check
buildings. This ﬁrm reported to
Army engineers, who re-evalu-
ated and assigned capacities.
Then the owners of the build-
ings were asked to lend them
for the purpose.

The buildings which have been
chosen are indicated by signs on
the outside. Inside, additional
signs may be found, with arrows
showing the direction of the
shelter. areas: horizontal if the
area is on the same floor, and
pointing up or down if the area
is on a different ﬂoor. There may
be as many as three arrows, indi-
cating several shelter areas.

Eventually food and equipment
‘for 14 days will be stored, ac-
cording to the capacity assigned
to the building. Local “shelter
wardens" will be assigned to take
charge, keep order, and see that
buildings are not overcrowded. In
caselof attack, one would go im-
mediately to the nearest building
showing one of these signs.

According to Relyea, the cor-.~

ridors and inside rooms of the
shelters, even‘ on the upper floors,
give more protection than do
many basements.

I New Anthropology Head Interviewed

 

 Landy Applies Knowledge

;\

 

By NANCY DELANEY

“Man, unlike the other ani-
mals, does not survive by
adapting his body to the en-
vironment, but rather by
adapting his environment to
suit his own needs.” This,
claims Dr. David Landy, new head
of the Anthropology Department,
is what has enabled man to build
great civilizations all over the
world. A V

Acording to Dr. Landy, it is
these modes of human adaptation
that are of primary interest to
the anthropologist. “In anthropo-
logy,” he asserts, “we are concern-
ed with the relationship between

man the biological organism and 

his total environment — physical,

chemical, and especially human.”
Dr. Landy is time anthropologist

who applies his knowledge of this

relationship to situations of social
and cultural change.
Research Contributed
In a study of the child develop-
ment stage, of- the socialization

_process, his research on “How

Little Puerto Ricans Become Big
Puerto Ricans” contributed to a
larger project concerning fertility‘
and population control in Puerto
Rico. Sponsored by the Iroquois
Research Award, he carried on a
similar study among‘ the Tuscar-
ora _Indians.
At Massachusetts lMenta’l

 

     

DR. DAVID LANDY

Health Center Dr. Landy exam-
ined the rehabilitation of men-
tal patients.

He was concerned with such
anthropological q u e s t i o n s_ as
“What in the family and cultural
environment contributes to an in-
dividual’s mental illness?”, “-What
in the social environment of the
hospital contributes to his cure?”,
and,“What happens when he re-
turns to the ‘real world?’ ’i’

V Came Here May 1

From Massachusetts Dr. Landy

came to the Graduate School of

‘Public Health and its Department
_-of. Anthropolgy three years ago.

He assumed chairmanship of the
Anthropology Department t h i 5
year on May 1.

Although the Department has
itself been at the‘ University
only three years, it has devel-
oped, Dr. Landy feels, into “one
of the ﬁner departments of an-
thropology in the United States.”
He attributes a great deal of
this to the “excellent faculty”
and “increasingly ﬁne grade of
students.”

The possession of the Human
Relations Area Files, a collection
of ethnographic material in

‘hundreds of systematicly arrang-

ed categories, and the publication

of the international journal, Eth- '

nology, also contributes to the cal-

"iber of the department, he main-

tains.

Besides the already mentioned
projects,~Dr. Landy, who received
his Ph.D. from Harvard in 1956,
has been a lecturer and research
associate in the School of Social
Work at Boston University. He has
also served as a research associ-
ate_in anthropology in_the Depart-
ment of Psychiatry at Harvard

'€~1'lght of people to choose those with whom they wish to

The Chancellor also feels in light of this premise that
t~Tis“ not the proper function of the University to use its‘
ower to attempt to dissuade those private organizations
which‘ practice discrimination in any of its varied forms,
sand that such action on the part of the University would
‘ “jeopardize its basic educational function.”

._~-cellor could give to Mrs. Salk’s letter, and he is correct in
 his action even if his reasons are not the best in the world.

I had not been to the zoo for more than ten
years, so that when some of my friends proposed
that we visit the Highland Park zoo I took in the
news with disbelief. I could not seriously imagine
grown ups, college students
wishing to indulge in such child-
ish acti_vi_ties. After some delib-

company them.

Prepared for a dull after-
noon, I envisioned myself dodg-
ing misbehaved brats and step-
ping on peanut shells left by
"careless visitors. and gazing
stupidly at equally dumb ani-
mals" behind the bars. My at-1 *
titude towards the situation
changed, however, minutes after we embarked on
the venture.

This was not because the animals proved inter-
esting or the children generously ‘sprinkled in our
way were well behaved or the visitors had used

-the trash cans and kept the Park clean, but" be-

cause the company was compatible. _

Back to good company. I have become convinced

nothing else, a student must. ﬁnd his way into a
circle .of versatile and diverse friends.
Unfortunately, the problem is not as" simple as it
may seem at ﬁrst. I have been lucky ‘in this respect,

glcult to be ablefto cultivate good friends at the Uni-
versity. The- scarcity of good companionship has_

rising standard of education which leaves little time
for the students to socialize and partly by its adher-
ence to the unorthodox trimester system. By the
time a friendship blossoms by some act of fate
within the ﬁrst two terms of school, spring term
comes to disperse the students for four months.

This time is usually crucial and issues a death
blow to most of the friendships. In the intervening
peri__od, the students often outgrow each other by
some change in their outlook on life. Were they
together, the new found friends would have been
able to adjust to changes in their companions; but
as it is when they meet" again each ﬁnds the other
a completely different personand the shock is too
much to take all at once. This terminates the com-
panionship and they start anew, only to be similar-
ily disillusioned the following year.
Must Find Solution , _ ~

A solution to this dilemma must be found. The
answer does not lie in the abandonment of the
trimester systemor proclaiming that the University
should not‘ uphold its high ‘standards for that would
be to stand in the way of progress. The proper way
to handle the situation, I think, would be to re-
duce the number ‘ofcredits the students take in
each term and maintain an all year school for
everyone.

This may "seem revolutionary to some at ﬁrst,
but I -maintain that rushing the students through

school‘ and—putting them under constant pressure ,

for three or four years do_es notaccomplish the ob-
jecive to train -more qualiﬁed personnel.

Jobopportunities in many areas are not keep-
ing pace with the ‘college graduates’ and in any
case it is far better to have qualiﬁed ‘technicians a
year later than to have a socially maladjusted per-
son." The; extra time would give the students the-
oppbrtunity to assimilate all the; knowledge they
receive in the class room and also to adjust. to sur-
roundings by being ‘in _good ‘company throughout
their college careers. '

LETTERS TO THE Ebiron  

Past ‘News’ Editor. V
Clarifies Meter Stand

Editor, The Pitt News:

I would like to correct one of
your infrequent but glaring in-
accuracies which appeared in a
story in your newspaper.

In the -Wednesday, May 1, edi-
tion of The Pitt News, you er-
roneously reported in a story on
the Oakland parking meters
that, after a .talk with the Chan-
cellor, past president of Student

“altered our opinions” on the
meter proposal. -

I, of course, did no such thing,
as I had pledged myself priv-
ately and in print..'(see editorial,
“No Compromise,,”' March, 18,
1963) to uphold the Pitt News
petition, which was a "student
protest, against_ the installation

of meters ..of any sort. Regardless‘
‘of “chances of success,” this is

how land 2,100 other students
felt. - _ A

Nor did.  Olofsongf to my
understanding, “alter his stand”

the Chancellor, as he had been
advocating a compromise from
the very beginning.

What is beyond my under-

standing is_why the new editor,
as his ﬁrst'oﬂ"rcial act, turned
the Pitt News-sponsored peti-
tions over to "Student ,Govern-
ment in. the ﬁrst place, rather

than take it to the City Council

planned. = H ' . ' _

The Centaur

John’ Updike’s The Centaur (Alfred A. Knopf, New York, 1963, 302 pp.,

By TOM PLATE

$4.00) is a

deeply serious attempt to transplant the myth of Chiron into a modern garden of evil and

watch its inexorable growth.

Noblest of all the Centaurs (half horses, half men), Chiron was wounded by chance
at a wedding feast when another Centaurtried to abscond with the bride. In the ensuing
 .~"turbulence Chiron was pierced by a poisoned arrow. Because Centaurs were traditionally

immortal,
gods to alleviate his pain by taking,
away his life; he oﬁered himself
in atonement for the ﬁre-stealing
Prometheus.

Granting his wish, the gods did
take away his pain, and Zeus, his
old friend, raised him to the status
of the constellation Sagittarius.
kg Anonymous Archer

In The Centaur, George Cald-
well is a teacher at Olinger High
School. During a particularly up-
roarious class, Caldwell is wound-
ed in the leg by an anonymous
archer.

Because of the repercussions
that result from his leaving the
classroom in swirling pain, and
because of subsequent events
that befall the present-day
Chiron, Caldwell ﬁnds his mind
and morale pierced, too: dis-
harmony with his wife, his bat-
ricaded relationship with his
son Peter, and his constant in-

‘opportune witnessing of his
boss’ capers.

Eventually he feels living is
useless and burdensome to" his
son. _ -

.- The counterpart of Prometheus,
Caldwell’s son Peter, steals some-
thing more abstruse than ﬁre from
the gods, for Peter is the lowest
step in a three-generation degen-
eracy.

Father's Abhorrence

His father’s father was a

minister; his father a teacher;

Peter will be an artist, much to’

his fat-her’s abhorrence. But
George has begun to ﬁnd himself.
‘In fact, Updike relates much of
the novel in. Peter’s retrospect.
When Peter’s father does ac-
cept death, Updike postscripts,
“Here, in the. Zodiac, now-above,
now, below, the horizon, he
(George Caldwell) assists in the
regulation of our destinies,
though in this latter time few
living mortals cast their eyes re-
spectfully toward heaven, and
fewer still sit as students to the

.. stars.” .

And as a student, one also won-
ders, after meditating'on Updike’s
moralistic ‘epilogue, what becomes
of ‘his son Peter (Prometheus was
tied to a rock and opened to the
birds)?

Led to Suspect

As a liver in the world’ his
father spurned, does he truly
escape a_,ter"rible fate? One is led
to suspect that this is so, for the
author has Peter say,A“It_ came to
me that I must goto Nature dis-
armed of perspective and stretch
myself like a large transparent
canvas upon her in the hope that,
my submission being perfect, the
imprint of a beautiful and useful
truth would be taken.”

But this novel is not written
only in the dimension of an-
alogy. The people one meets
on the way are, as E. M. Forster
say, both “flat” and

“round.” They are flat as parts
of an analogy; they are round
as real, complex, human-textur-
ed people.

For example, Updike diverts
from the profundity of Caldwell’s
earthly degeneration to introduce
Heller, the school’s custodian, in
perhaps the most charming of the
novel’s scenes. One wonders if the
author included this passage at

l“‘thi_s point as a poetical contrast

device, for without comparison,
tine really has nothing with which
to judge George Caldwell.

‘Poetical Verse
The author is poetical in his

Chiron beseeched the 9

verse. Just when one would tend
to criticize his style as being
somewhat too predictable, Updike
invariably injects a delightful
line or two as much on the boun-
dary between poetry and prose as
is his plot between myth and
reality.

Updike writes of Peter’s dog,
“Lady was so happy to be let
indoors she was a‘ bomb of good
news, a furry bustle of vortical

The Centaur is an important
ecstasy that in vibrating em-
mitted a scent of a skunk she
had killed a week ago. Hunting
a ‘god, she started toward my
-father, veered past my legs,
jumped to the sofa, and in
frantic gratitude licked my
grandfather's face.”

V In addition, Updike pleases the
student, not so‘ much in the way
Salinger does with sex and ob-
scenity (although these are in
this_- novel too, but usually pur-
posefully), but by including an
index of" mythological reference,‘
thus greatly facilitating study of
this novel.

novel because it deals with some

 

very important questions, some
philosophic,
It is a smooth and well-thought
out novel. But most importantly,
even though the author has not
answered any questions, he does,
with the incisive tool of pertinent
analogy, raise several. In reading

-The Centaur, one feels that he is

part of a serious and studious
search into life. All in all, one is
immensely glad he has read the

book. /

Sports Editor

 

 

Pennsylvania football material under an agreement that

Forwo rd Step

Pitt, Syracuse and Penn State are making a deﬁnite move
in the right direction with the adoption of a letter of intent
for incoming freshmen athletes.

The letter will not only take quite a bit of pressure off of
the high school athlete, but
should also help football
coaches reduce their sleepless
nights.

Here is the way the letter
works. Once a student signs
a letter of intent saying he
will go to one of the three
schools involved he is under
obligation to go to that school.
If he wants to back out of the
obligation he can, but will
lose a year of varsity eligi-
bility.

The three Eastern schools
are not the only ones doing
this. Many of the major con-_
ferences are adopting the idea.

Athletic D i r e c t o r Frank
Carver feels that everyone‘
will beneﬁt‘ from the letter.
“First of all, it takes the pressure off the kids,” he said. “Once

they’ve signed the letter none of the other schools involved
are going to try and recruit them.”

Frank Carver

Of course this will not alleviatethe pressure exerted on
the boys from other schools, not involved in the three school
agreement, but it will aid the three schools greatly since they
are each others biggest rivals when it comes to recruiting.

There is a good chance that West Virginia will also join
in the agreement. This would make the pact even -stronger.
It would group the four biggest competitors for Western

rules out many shady recruiting practices.

One aspect of the agreement that has not been agreed
upon is the number of letters each school can give out. Carver
feels there must be a limit, at around 25, to prevent a school
from signing up more prospects than they need. Even if a
school gives out 25 letters, they can still take more boys.

That detail and the signature of the University heads. is
all that stands in the way of the agreement being ﬁnalized.

aseball Team

 

Play J uniata Thursday;
West Virginia Saturday

Duquesne University provides the opposition for the
Panthers this afternoon at 3:30 at Herschel Field. The Pan-
thers then travel to J uniata on Thursday, and West Virginia

Saturday.

The Panthers split their two games with Duquesne last
year, winning the ﬁrst, 10-0, behind John Carlisle, who will

pitch for the Panthers today. Al
Ricciuti and John Cioﬁi were the
batting stars in the game. Ric-
ciuti drove in six runs on a triple
and three singles, and Ciofﬁ hit a
home run.

Duquesne came back to win
the second game, scoring single
runs in the third, fourth, and
ﬁfth inings, to defeat the Pan-
thers, 3-2. Andy Alex was the
losing pitcher.

Panthers Have Edge

Both teams have played Fort
Belvoir. The Dukes split their
two games, while the Panthers
won two. The Panthers won their
games by scores of 7-4 and 15-10
while the Dukes won 9-4, and
lost, 12-9.

The Dukes main problem
seems to be defense. They com-
mitted eight errors behind Fran
Caricato in their loss to Bel-
voir, and committed three er-
rors in their loss to California
State, 6-5.

Any one of three pitchers may
hurl for Coach“Bobby Lewis at
Juniata. Lewis could pitch Sylvis,
Alex, or Lee Brueckel _in the
game. If Sylvis pitches Thursday,
Dave Sauer’ will pitch against
West Virginia.

Two Unbeaten

West Virginia, which has won
nine of its ﬁrst ten games, has
two. undefeated left handed pitch-
ers. Sophomore John Radosevich
and senior Dave Wilson have
identical 4-0 records. Mountain-
eer. coach Steve Harrick said of
his two southpaws, “Radosevich
and Wilson are two of the best
lefties I’ve ever had.”

Two of last year’s leading
hitters are also back for the
Mountaineers. Outﬁelders Jim
Procopio batted .366 last year,
driving in 12 _runs, and steal-
ing 13 bases. 'Second baseman
Joe Hatalla batted .379 last
year, hitting one home run; and

Assistant football coach Walt
Cummings reports no academic

Tenth Victory

Allegheny College became

of Bobby Lewis’ Panther
baseball team, falling before

The Panthers won, 23-9.

The Panthers scored ﬁve runs
in the ﬁrst inning, six in the third,
and ﬁve in the fourth, giving
starter Dave Sauer a 16-2 lead.
Jim Marquis, A1legheny‘s starting
pitcher, lasted only two and one

“It was a pitcher’s duel all th

third win. Lewis explained Sauer’s
generosity. “It’s hard to beat
down when you have a 16-2. lead,”
he said. “Even though a pitcher
should never let up like Sauer

Track Team   Win Streak At Stake Against Lions

By FRANK SMIZIK

Revenge should be the
guiding force behind" the Pan-
thers on Saturday, as they
tangle with the Nittany Lions
of Penn State at the Stadium.
‘They received a 971/2-371/2

drubbing at the hands of the
Lions last season.

The teams are much more even
according to performances this
season. The Nittany Lions record
this year is an unimpressive 0-2,
while the Panthers show ,a 3-1
mark. The Staters, however, have
met powerful Navy and Ohio
State.

The Lions top star is Howard
Deardorff, a distance man who
owns the Stadium record in the
mile of 4:O9.8, which he set ‘two
years ago. Last year Vance Car-

ter pushed Deardorﬂf into running

an outstanding 1250.6 half-mile at

University Park.

‘ Although Deardorff should cap-
ture the distance events the
Panthers have a good chance to
dominate the sprints. Bill Del-
Vecchio has shown he can do 9.6

in the 100-yard dash and has done , '

a 21.5 in the 220—yard run. Bill
Gregg of Penn State had "a 21.6
in the "meet against Ohio State
last_ week. '
The 440-yard run is another
toss—up. Vance Carter ran the best
440 of his career in last Satur-
day’s meet” by turning in a time of
48.1. Carter pulled a leg muscle
around-the ﬁnalbend and imme-
diately went to the dressing room.
He had a slight swelling, but
Coach Carl Rees is hoping the leg
willbe all right for Saturday.

year has been 51-feet. '
The discus should not be as

According to Rees there will be

no two mile race, but _,instead,

there--~will be a three mile run.
John Bailey-, the Panther’s top
two miler, will compete in the
three’ mile race. Ralph Basinski
and Steve Waslo should be the
other Panther entrants.

The last event in the meet, the
mile‘ relay, may decide the ﬁnal
outcome. Rees said, “The meet is
very even, but if our boys put out
what I think they can, we have a
good chance of beating them.”

IM Softball
Loop Sign-Up

Starts Monday

Intramural softball "will be-
gin shortly,_ according to di-
rector Leo ‘Bemis, “We’ll get

started "as "soon as we have ‘

enough teams en.ter’ed,"’ Bemis
said. _

There‘ willbe a meeting of, all
teams ‘interested in playing in the
league Monday in the ; Student
Union lobby at noon. League rules
‘will be discussed aswill the make
up ofthe schedule and-the num-
ber of leagues to be formed.

Bemis is hopeful that there
will be at least as many teams
signing up this year as there‘ were
last Spring when 14 teams regis-
tered. _ V , '

Engineers Win

Last’ season” the teamsiwere di-

vided into two leagues, the Amer-

.‘ ican and ‘National. The Chemical

Engineers ' won’ the National
League title and the Losers edged
the Psychology Department to win
the American league. Inithe cham-
pionship battle between the two
teams, the Engineers won, 7-2.
Any student who wishes to
play softball, but is not on a
team, should also a.ttend.Mon-“
day’s meeting. Bemis said that if
enough such students sign up
he will make up a team compos-
ed of them, but if there are not
enough he will put them on
existing teams.

Bemis’ also cleared up the situ- ,

ation concerning who,i_s allowed
to participate in the league. Dur-
ing the fall and winter trimesters
only full time students may parti-
cipate, but -Bemis has waived that
rule for the spring trimester. ,
Restrictions : Lifted _
Accordingtto Bemis, “Any stu-
dent thattattended the fall and_
winter trimester may participate
in intramural competition this
summer ‘and any student who is
attending the spring trimester‘,
even if it‘is not on a full-time
basis, may also participate.”
One of the highlights o_f the
softball season, the. faculty-stu- A

, dent game, will be continued

this year. , .

Bemis alsoiannounced plans to
have badminton and _tennis tour-
naments later in the trimester.

He said that students could
sharpen up their game for these
tournaments by taking advantage
of the facilities atpthe Field House.
Tennis courts have been set up
where the bleachers are during
the, basketball season and badmin-
ton courts have been set up on
the basketball ‘ﬂoor.

Bemis also ‘,hop_es to inaugurate

' ' intramural horse shoes this year.

_ Coach Carl Rees’ hopes of a
successful track season suffered
a harsh blow when grade reports
cameout a_few weeks ago.

The team’s leading pole vaulter,
Dave Garwood, flunked out of
school and two other top notch
runners will probably miss the
season.

Garwood owns the Pitt pole
vault record with a jump of 14-
feet 3-inches. According to Rees,
“Garwood’s loss hasn’t hurt us
too much yet, because we_ have
two other good pole vaulters in
Gary‘ Meckley and Ron Weirs.
But when we start getting into

tougher competition ‘like Penn
State and Navy, I think we"ll ‘miss
Dave.”

Runner Bob Henry, called by '

Rees “our best half-miler,” will
not be able to compete this sea-
son because he has not passed
enough credits during the last
two trimesters to participate in
athletics. ‘

Bob'Buell, one of the team’s

better quarter-milers, is, in the,

same situation as Henry. His
case, however, is being reviewed
by the Athletic Committee and
there is a chance that he will

_ compete this season.
