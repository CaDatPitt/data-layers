Preliminary preparations:-for Senior Week» received a tem-
porary setback Wednesday when Student -Council, meeting in

special session, failed to ratify

selections of the senior cabinet

for the chairinanshipslof the V  and the classball. V V
In refusing to endorse either of the two candidates,Coun-

cil referred them back tothe’ senior cabinet with the suggestion-

that the body reconsiderits sel

were the choice of the cabinet for

general Senior Week chairman and 

Senior ball chairman, respectivelyr
Men Not A¢tive A

 Council based its Vrefusali toigive S

sanction to the appointments on the

grounds that the positions should 

go to seniors who have lbeefri more

i active in the extra-curricular work.  i
V of the school than have the two men T

submitted by thé cabinet.

The opinion of. CouncilV.was3_ex-V . l
V pressed principally by James Lind-T V
V say, Bus. "

Ad. ’30 ; Endicott - Batchel-A
der, Bus. Ad. ’30, and Fred Lucas:

Bus. Ad. ’31, who presented iargu- -
ments that met with the‘ -approval

of all members present. VVVLindsaYV
stated that /although both Under-

wood and McCullough were his pet?‘ V
-sonal friends and that _ he thought i
them capable of carrying 0ui3“Vth.§ i

work entailed in the twoV_DQ$iti0n$5:
he believed that several other seni-
ior men were: better V qualiﬁed for,
the appointments because of greatitgr
services performed

manships had al ,ays been regarded
as the last honor that the class»
could confer upon V a member. T,3I!d_V
that they should therefore go as 8
reward to men who -had taken an
act-,ive~ part in eittra-curricular .work_.

Morality” at a meeting sponsored
b_v_ the W. S. G, A. scholastic. com-
mittee last Monday in- the Heinz

- « " _‘ : morality is not aninstitution. of the
>5?‘  past. but that we still have the old
‘ rules‘ which are‘, being adopted ;to

our present living conditions.‘ He
deﬁned morality  -«as something.
V f‘xv‘n1ch_aims at what; is good” and
- \ ‘ which mﬁuences our“ health ‘habits,
reading and social ‘contacts. ,- v
D1‘._AVe.V’.s talk ‘was: the ﬁrstfof‘

photo-naturalist in the zoology de-‘

‘ chanic developed a machine superior’

toit. This machine, which is being

used (‘to make pictures. of growing 

plants, owes its superiority‘ to lts‘*‘*

greater range of vision. The hu-__
"man eye can only see the middle’ ‘

range of -intermediate motion,_~ but -
this camera caneven show the slow’, 

Mr.‘ .McC1in- -

tock will attempt ‘to show the 

lyric“ variety‘ of plant motions-which here-7. ~

tofore have remained ‘practically

will close one of the most successful seasons in Pitt history.

Hyatt made his start in the 'court‘>"““*-"‘*-

». game scarcely before he had .ent_ered
-‘Vhis teens, ﬁrst at the old Union-
‘ town Y. M. C. A., then at Union-
~town‘High and-ﬁnally at Pitt.
,1 . Will Miss Hyatt
“ A During. his three years of varsity
~ «competition, Hyatt has led not only-
his own team‘ in scoring’ but the
‘whole eastern se(:.’r-ion,_of- the country
‘as well.
V-“that Charley was an individual
"‘*-player. Those who have seen the
- Panthers play ‘ know that
starts practically every play, and it
V- is he who usually makes the final
pass to a man cutting -forthe bas-
V_ ketball. Baker, Reed and Stash
-_:VWrobleski,; three of the highest
scoring guards, in collegiate ranks,
 ‘were; all fed. by the indomitable
_ _jHyatt. ,It was only when -on of
. zthesemen could not break _‘ se
. that Hyatt would attempt to dribble
VV -through the. opposition up to the.
‘basket, a feat which he accom-
plished many times. Hyatt was
: yevera threat while he was on the
W" - ; f.loor'.; '. _ ;
-V .. .Hyatt has been honored by both
f\i‘iend and foe.
. -Butler last season, 16,000 fans ‘gave
- _ Hyatt the greatest ovation ever-ac?
«corded any player on that com-t,.'and
»Hyatt was not one of the home
 boys. Notre Dame fans gave Hyatt
 a big hand, and even; Carnegie Tech
 supporters -; have condescended-~ to
give Hyatt a great hand.‘ ‘
Hyatt has given many ‘noteworthy
 exhibitions on the court, but the
  .- - most .spectacular_ game. he sever‘
V " i V V? “played was: that with. Montana -State
at the stadium . early this season.
Had, he never played another game
in -his life. Hyatt would -still be re-
» . meinbered for that one super-human
: ‘effort when almost singlehanded he
- won for the Panthers over a great
team composed of Cat Thompson.
the.Ward brothers, .Ario and Worth-
ington. .After that game _Hyatt
collapsed andhe remained in the
‘ dressing room for ten minutes, doing
nothing but sweating. Then _there_
 was the game with Grove City at
' the stadium last year when Charley
ran up 24 points against the ‘great
\ . Red Ryan, the game with Notre
Damein 1928 when his_ﬁeld_ goal
clinched a national championship tor
,-__the_ Panthers, the game V_ with‘
' Georgetown this War, thegame
-with Temple, the two.Army games,
the Iowa game this year, and nu-
‘  merous others. P .t will surely
’ miss Hyatt after he has gone.
 4 ‘Les Cohen Through
‘ V - » Les Cohen, who started Dlalfing
V . ' with Charley at the Uniontown
1? M. C. A., will also be sorelypmissed
V V _ .by:~the. Pantliers after this season.
 Les has been a mus,-h underrated

Last but not ‘least .. among the
players to graduate is” the diminu-

learned the rudiments of"the ‘game

the city league. Playing with a‘
team thatdid not make: much A-use
of ‘the passingV‘phaseV of the -g:>;ne,;

it a device known! as ‘ elaye

. use with long land telephone lines

and also for transoceanic conversa-

low certain closing devices to oper-
ate prior to transmission of elec-
trical speech waves. Such a_, sys-

fected. Inverted speech is unintel-
ligibleito a listener and isan‘ in-

-Four ..:impoVrtant suggestions { for
thegimprovement of freshman tradi-
tionswere offered at aeluncheon for
February freshmen given. at the
_Faculty'Club recently. Urging the

adoption of a more distinctive fro’-sh

.cap,V.slengthening of customs period,
co-operation ‘between the. traditions
committee and freshmen, and more
class
their’ opinions of customs as they
are. - ' ' i 

'1‘heir1: sentiment ..was that the

fresh cap should be in some way

symbolic of the University. The
Scotch cap, with a plaid band, such

. as Carnegie Tech‘ plebes wear, is " an
‘example of .this’.’’ Although the ‘pur-

chase of -‘a distinctive cap‘ would in-
volve a. higher charge, the point of

?lind_ividuality has its value. The tra-
ditions committee has taken up -the ‘

suggestion, and aifelt and wool'hat-
ioznpany is working on sam-

meetings, Vfreshmen voiced

 

The V first year men also suggested
that one - of ?..their:; number .*be in-
cluded _in thencommittee that sets
up the:;*customs._ This» method was
followed on this semester's commit-
tee as ' closely ans? possible, for Chas.
B. Hugus, ’a{;'September freshman,
was included in the committee with
Viers, Adams, Ed. ,’30',‘and Carl.H.
Voss, Col_'.j,.’32,. . It is claimed. to be
both ‘practical * and advantageous
psycho _’pgi¢a§11y. .- ] . V

Mora,'_cla,s_s,,;_meetings-' was another
general need expressed‘ by the yearl-
‘ings- ,.0nly two mass meetingswere
held Vduring-j.-the. customs period end-
in"g 'VFebr'tf1ar‘y: 28:‘ ::Mo.te -‘such meet-
ings -,woi1l,d. Tcreate stronger class
consciousness, introduce leaders in
.the._class. and. result  enerally in
more and .- better acqua ntances.

As .12. ﬁnaljo inion,"aVVmajority of
the freshmen’ elt that customs did
actually help to integrate the fresh-
