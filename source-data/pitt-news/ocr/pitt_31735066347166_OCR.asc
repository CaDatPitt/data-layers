, Energy Conservation Woes Surface

BY RICH HARRY

Pitt's newly constructed build-
ings may pose problems for energy
conservation on campus, according
to Dean Arthur Fedel, chairman of
the University Senate Council’s
Plant ’ Utilization and Planning
Committee.

Fedel explained the facilities,
including the new Chemistry, Law

and Social Science buildings, were A
_designed nearly 10 years before

energy problems began to plague
the country. _

“These new buildings were
planned and locked into construc-
tion before the energy crisis became
an issue,” he said. “Therefore,
energy conservation was not one of

, the design factors. ”

Explaining the problems with the
new buildings, Fedel pointed out
their lighting systems are designed
to simultaneously" illuminate an
entire floor. “Despite the fact only
one man may be working on the

floor, the entire floor must be"

illuminated needlessly.’ '

The joint subcommittee on.

energy ‘conservation, part of the
Senate Council’s committee is
assessing measures to remedyithe
situation, Fedel said.

and controls to see if wecan break
them down to compact units,” he
said. “Therefore, ‘instead of
lighting an entire ﬂoor for one
man’s use, we can perhaps light up
only one-sixth of the floor.”
Evaluating the energy-cost of the
new buildings is only part of the
subcommittee’s plans_for energy
conversation, Fedel said. it also will

look into student scheduling to.

maximize energy use, he added.
“Instead of having students
scheduled for classes in three
separate buildings, we would-like to
see them rescheduled into just one
or two,” Fedel said. “That way we

can close a building for the time

‘being and save energy we would

otherwise use needlessly.”

Student rescheduling also would
produce “spin-off benefits,” ac-
cording to Fedel. “Rescheduling
into fewer buildings would diminish
the area needed in terms of security
and safety because there wouldbe
more controlled patterns of student
trafﬁcbetween classes and build-
ings.” . - --
Despite the possibility that- the
new buildings may incur increases

in energy costs, Fedel is optimistic
the University community will
cooperatewith the subcommittee in
saving energy. ‘
‘,‘We are all aware of energy
conservation, pollution and wasting
money," he said. “It ultimately
comes down to what effects us
immediately—our pocketbooks. If
tuition and taxes must be-increased
to compensate for these costs,
' people will then realize it would
smart to save energy.”

Fedel indicated Pitt has achieved

“enormous savings" over the past
‘ year through energy‘ conservation
, techniques, including the modiﬁca-
tion of thermal paths of hot and cold
air conducted through .Benedum
Hall. .
“Almost 40% of the economy we
made last year was made in
Benedum alone.” .
He also said the University saved
a total of $600,000 in the use of
electricity and steam. ‘ ‘The savings
we_ initiated last year amounted to
the full tuition, fees and costs of
about 125 full-time students.”

Burger King Comes ToPitt 

The Oakland area is getting
another hamburger-heaven.

The Burger King Corporation will
erect a restaurant at the corner of
Fifth and Oakland Avenues,

according to new franchise holder‘

Richard Peterson.

V _The building, site is currently 0

being excavated by the Wright
Demolition and Excavation Com-
pany of Pittsburgh. Two Oakland
businesses, a clothing store and a
luncheonette, were torn down last

 week to make room for the
“We will look at lighting levels

franchise.

‘The restaurant will be “slightly
larger” than the standard Burger
King, when completed, and ,will
have a 15 car parking garage in its
basement for patrons, according. to
Peterson.

“University students, athletic
events and the heavy traffic through
the Oakland area will provide a lot of
the customers for the new
restaurant, ’ ’ Peterson ‘said.

“There certainly is enough room
for another fast food franchise in
Oakland,” Peterson said.

_. The. projected date of completion
for the restaurant is around Jan. 15,
Peterson said.

Provost Seeks Input

For Teaching Review

BY TOBI ROKSEN

A University-wide plan for
student evaluation of teaching will
have to wait for recommendations
from Senate Council,

The Provost’s Ofﬁce, which first
appointed the Committee on the
Evaluation of Teaching that wrote

, the plan, is seeking input from
various

campus bodies before
making a ﬁnal decision on the
recent committee report.

The report proposes the estab-
lishment of ‘separate centers for

“We’re proposing a better
system of faculty evaluation,”
committee member Christopher

Rawson said. “The faculty dossier

must include signiﬁcant informa-'
tion on teaching.”-

According to Assistant Provost.
Ray Steele, teaching will now
become a more important part of the
tenure process if the report is-
approved. ; '

Some Committee members ex-
pressed fear the report would be

BY MARILYN WEISS

When students discover monthly
food costs are taking a big bite out of

. their budget, they should consider

applying for food stamps, according
to Margaret Farcus, assistant

. director of the foodstamp program

in the Penn District, which Serves
Allegheny County.

Many students are eligible for
food stamps and are receiving them
now, she said. But many others
may be eligible and don’t know it.

Students who are living on their
own and not claimed as dependents
on their parents income tax form,
and have cooking facilities, are
eligible for the monthly food stamp
coupon issuances, Farcus said.

Students living at_ home. are _

, eligible only ‘if vtheirppparentsp are

meeting Wednesday, according to
CSO chairman Hank Kearney. In

Think about    
  your future.    

-rm: PQT counn BE 1111:: KEY TO YOUR rurunri.

If you are receiving a degree in Mathematics
or Language before September 1977, the
National Security Agency's Professional
Qualification Test (PQT) can be the key to

a rewarding career.

You must register by November 6 in order
to take the PQT on campus— it will not be
given again during the school year. By
scoring well on this test, you will qualify

for an employment interview. During the
interview, an N SA representative will
discuss the role you might play in furthering
this country's communications security

or in producing vital intelligence infor-

' mation.

 

   

The PQT helps to measure your aptitude
for career areas such as: -

LANGUAGES -— Foreign languages are
valuable tools for research, analysis, and

' documentation projects. Advanced training

in your primary language or perhaps a new
language can be expected. _
COMMUNICATIONS — Developing and
testing logical designs for global communi-

cations is a unique pursuit. It follows that
your training programs in this area will be

- both extensive and esoteric‘.
PROGRAMMING — Our vast communications

‘analysis projects could not be effectively
managed without the latest computer
hardware/ software and people who know -
how touse them.

PICK UP A PQT BULLETIN‘at your college
placement office. It contains a registration _form
which you must "mail prior to November 6 '

in order to take the test on November 20.

Electronic Engineering, Computer Science,
Slavic, Mid-Eastern "and Asian language
majors may interview without taking the

PQT. ' I ‘

ADVERTlSEMENT

    

Next Thursday, October 21, at
7:00 p.m., the University of Pitts-
burgh Auto Racing Team will go
through its annual ritual of releas-
ing its week-end racing schedule-
for 1977, and organizing interest-

"ed students that would like to at-

tend the week-end events as spec-
tators. The members of the téam

‘w ‘

).'

will naturally be going along as an .

intricate part of the “Pitt” crew.
The meeting is going to be held in
the Student Union, everybody is
invited, refreshments will be serv-
ed, and a film will be shown. Trav-
el arrangements will be explained
to the student body as well as
lodgings and admission to the re-
sort area race tracks throughout
eastern United States. The team in
the past has arranged car pools for
the students, each occupant pay-

‘ing an equal share of the gasoline

costs, and the owner of the vehicle
getting to travel free. Lodgings are
arranged at the nearest college
dormitory or Holiday Inn, for ex-

ample. The dormitory accomoda- ,

tions, usually two in a room, are
about $5 per person per night.
However, most of the students-
have been recently preferring the
motels where they can put four

, people in ’ a considerably larger

and more comfortable room, at
the same price per person. The ad-
mission to the track for spectator
members usually includes a dis-
count, and entitles the student to

- be in the pit area with the. school’s
. auto racing team, not merely in

the general spectator area. _ .
Fryer and other members of the
team describe the weekends as be-
ing rock festival—like, and includ-
ing organized social events on the
college campus or in,the nearby
community on both Friday and
Saturday nights of the week-end.
As far as the actual members of
the team are concerned, the first
membership meeting of the year
involves individuals bidding for va-
rious positions on the team like
office manager, public relations di
director, race shop manager, chief

‘ mechanic, support vehicle director,

I.)

systems manager, parts procure-*

ment manager, and four office
secretaries primarily for publicity
and student travel arrangements.
This year the team is Eonsider-
ing going to Daytona Beach, Flori-
da, in February, and Sebring, Flori-
da, in March. Other race track 10-
cations include Indianapolis, At-

lanta, Watkins Glen, New York;

Pocono, Pennsylvania; Warren, , ,
Ohio, and the Columbus, Ohio, _

area. Fryer says that auto racing
on a professional level, like this,
is something that the average stu-
dent in college is rarely exposed
to. Consequently, -those that go
along on these week-end excur-
sions just once, are hooked and
turn into some of the most avid
rnotorsp orts enthusiasts you might

imagine. Throughout the past four V

years that the team has been in
existence, it has provided some of
the most exciting and unforget-
table experiences for the student.

Numerdus team members have '

even .changed'their field of educa-
tion because of the inﬂuence of

the auto racing team,,anEl many‘

have received. jobs as a direct re-
sult of contacts that they made at

the races, and through their deal-

ings with some of the‘ executives

Q5112 1Bitt-iﬁefms 

Alternatives Needed r

Education at Pitt and at most universities across'the nation is a passive
process. Professors lecture students on what they think students should
know. The students then repeat back to the professor, by way of exams,
what they learned he thinks they should know.

Alternative forms of education must be developed. This is why there
is a need for a campus organization to study and promote alternative
education methods—an organization like the Collective for Alternative
Education (CAE).

There is a deﬁnite need for an organization with CAE’s stated
purposes; to study and promote alternative education. But the
Committee on Student Organization (CS0) has recommended that the
Student Government Board (SGB) withdraw its partial recognition of the
CAE. CSO feels CAE is ‘not living up to its stated purpose in its
constitution. '

The main line of disagreement between CS0 and CAE is CAE’s
attempts to sponsor speakers and movies ‘seemingly unrelated to
education. Like the movie Finally Got The News, a history of the

rank-and-ﬁle labor movement in Detroit. Or bringing in speaker
Herbert Apetheker to speak on the history of America's working class
people, minorities and women. Apetheker is the curator of the W. E.B.
Du Bois archives. <.~ '

Another source of ill feeling is CAE support of the Student Coalition
Against Tuition Hikes and the Committee to Defend Paul Nyden.

CAE members explain that they want not only to promote and study
alternative education but also to educate the masses on subjects which

they feel were only touched upon lightly and inaccurately in history
courses. This is an ideal goal, but they must meet-with CS0 and SGB
and decide whether it should be a goal of CAE. _

But looking at what CAE has done, and what it has plarmed, the
decision to withdraw partial recognition should indeed be reconsidered.

CAE is very actively involved with Pitt's major alternative education
program, the Alternative Curriculum (AC), according to members of
CAE. Two CAE members are teaching assistants in the AC program.
"lhe AC is up for review this - year to see if the program merits
continuation. CAE plans, according to members, to be very active in
AC’s defense. ‘ .

Other speakers and movies planned include 'lhe New School, a look at

' education in Cuba, and speaker Herbert Gintis on ‘ ‘ Education and how it

relates to society in the United States.” The above seem to follow the
stated purpose of CAE.

‘ Withdrawal , of partial recognition results in a savings of
approximately $100 to student allocations funds. It is obvious the move
is not a ﬁnancial one.

Partial recognition should not be withdrawn from CAE because of a
mere semantic argument. There is, without a doubt, a need for an
organization like CAE. SGB should reject the recommendation made by
CS0 and extend CAE’s probationary period an additional year. SGB
should thenttake this year to iron out the differences between itself and
CAE.

Legal marijuana is nearer than
most devotees realize. Tailor-made

time now by the big tobacco
companies using the U.S. island

colonies as experimental market

« openly, in the Zone of the Interior.

So call me a jerk when it comes

Just don't go confusing football
with “school spirit," whatever that
phrase means these days.

The term should really be retired

“School spirit" was; a popular
phrase that went well with girls in
bobby-sox and hulks with fear-
inspiring names like Moose who
ruled the malt shop in athletic
sweaters.

In the 605 we would've called it
"involvement" or “participation, "
but that timé"s gathered some dust,
too, and so we have to arrive at our

own terminology rather than‘

Let Students Do

The Evaluating

I would like to propose that the
evaluation of Dr. Paul Nyden be
done by the students. . More

, speciﬁcally, by those students who

_ have been educated by Nyden
during the period (determined by

' the sociology department) that the
sociology department contends his
scholarship has been poor.

I realize the premise (Nyden’s
poor level of scholarship) disagrees
with Nyden’s contention that the
true premise for his dismissal has
been his pro-socialist activities. M
But I believe by doing it this way
three possible things can be
accomplished: (1) Evaluation will
be based on the sociology
department’s\contention of scholar-
ship level; (2) Students at the
University will be afforded the
opportunity to be involved with
their institution of higher learning;
and (3) Nyden would be satisfied

‘ that this evaluation of his teaching
was done by an impartial jury. In
addition, Nyden has contended that
his scholarship has been good.

If Nyden’s teaching is approved
by the students then we will not

students here at Pitt. Even though
businesses and banks claim they
are giving the students a‘ better

ideal time after time, this has been
proven false.

_ Take the banks for instance:
They offer you free checking and in
turn charge you if you don’t have
over $200 in your checkin g account.
I ask you, how many students
maintain this kind of an acocunt?

:The stores in Oakland prices are

A far exceeding those in other areas.

The grocery stores for example
have a poor quality of food at
higher prices. They know that the
students won’.t go _far just to buy a
few articles.

I feel as though the consumers
should consider the fact that the
students make up a large portion of
the residents
should take in account that we are
not employed'and don’t have fat
wallets.

Co“-'op*Bu'y'e‘rs"‘ﬂiscoverw“‘E   ‘ '

BY LISA RUBENSTEIN

Three o'clock in the morning sure
looks a lot different when you're
getting up than it does when you’re
falling asleep, Ithought as I shut the
door of the borrowed, beige YMCA
van. Four of us were headed for the
.strip district Downtown to buy
produce for the Student Govern-
ment sponsored Co-op.

I kept wondering if Thursdays
weren’t bad enough without adding
the‘ torture of exhaustion.

“Do you stay up all night when
you do this?” I asked the produce
buyer and the driver of the van,
Dale Giovengo.

“No,” he-said. I couldn’t believe
he would get up every Thursday
morning to go buy food for all those

‘unknowing co-op members. ‘ ‘Don’t
worry, just wait until about ﬁve
o’clock—if feels like ﬁve o'clock in
the -afternoon. ’ ’ _ V

I’ can't wait, I thought. Jim
Gascoine and Maggie McNeely,
co-op members, sat in the back seat
of the van, blinking the sleep from
their eyes.

We arrived at the strip district, a
large area which is the distribution

_ point for farm goods for a large part

of Pennsylvania and West Virginia. «

First stop, Banana City. The
warehouse was dark with a high
cement walkway jutting out from
the side to accommodate the trucks
that were its usual customers. We
scrambled over the side and found
ourselves standing in a huge open
space with one large cooler after
another lined up against the walls.

“Hi," Dale said. “We’d like a
case of bananas.” A case of
bananas translates into four large
boxes of heavy pieces of fruit and
several pulled muscles and strained
backs.

“How do you want them, I have
them new or turning?” a big man,
pufﬁng on a large stogie said. He
opened several boxes of bananas
until Dale nodded his head.

“Those are okay,”he. said.

Pitt's food co-op pays for its’
goods by credit, so Dale and the two
other co-op members who go with
him every week don’t have to carry‘

.. hundreds of dollars in cash in their

pockets.

Dale showed the man a little
yellow card, stamped with the date, ’
that allowedus to carry fourboxes
of bananas to the back seat of the
van. '

_ The next stop took us to beans,
carrots, app1es°and tomatoes, from
Maniet and Sons.

“Oh, you people go to Pitt?”
Maniet asked as he showed us crate
after‘ crate of beautiful, red
tomatoes and told us the price.
“That’s 71/2.”

I went through most. of the_

morning before I realized that
‘.‘7‘/2” meant $7.50 for a crate.

Dalewhipped out a brand new
calculator and began punching out
figures to come up with the unit
price each co-cop customer pays.
“Yep,” he said. “Do you have any
mushrooms today.”

was close to 4:30 a.m. and it seemed
strange to think that all the people
who would eat this fruit were still in

Strip District Hustles While Rest Of City Sleeps

Earlier was hard to comprehend. Z
The lives of the people who workon " A 

the strip are almost entirely
opposite those most‘ Pitt students

lead. They sleep during the day and 

work at night.

We loaded the fruit into the van 
and headed off toward the strip’s *

main terminal. Jim anxiously

encouraged Dale to park near the 

end so we wouldn’t have to lug the
' crates of fruit too far. “Well, it's
just that there is this huge bar that
you can’t get the trucks past,” he
said.

Trucks are thensmall, motorized _A
or hand-operated carts used for »
transferring the boxes from one "

area to the next.

- The main terminal was busier
than the other places. The air was
so cold it reminded me of one large
cooler—the kind of cold that seeps
in underneath ﬂannel shirts and
sweatshirts and explains why those
accustomed to it are decked out in‘
hats and gloves, even though it’s
only early October. i

In fact, each of the different
produce merchants looked so alike
in their jackets and hats that! even,"
without the lightheadedness of too‘

little sleep and not enough coffee, I ‘ A

still couldn’t tell them apart. They
all were short and smoked cigars, it
seemed. We walked from one end‘
to the-other, past shiny apples and
pears that gleamed in the artiﬁcial
light as if someone hadtbeen hired
to polish each with a rag. Grape-:

' fruits, huge bags of onions and

potatoes piled in huge pyramids.

Dale walked over to the
potatoes—“Can I have a look at
these?” .

The merchant walked over and
opened the top of the bag. Dale
'looked at the potatoes, regular
'white to me, of assorted sizes, and
"said, “No, I think we’ll take the

* more expensive ones.”

“Why won’t you take these?” I
asked.

“Well, they’re pretty wet, and
,'they’d only be good for things like
mashed potatoes,” he answered.
Dale was never a buyer before he
started working for the Pitt co-op,

but he worked in the produce
department of a grocery store in
Ambridge and had been to the strip
with buyers as they made their

rounds. Now, Dale works at a Giant A

Eagle in the produce department.

I took‘ another look at those
potatoes. I never knew you could
tell so much about a vegetable by its
outward appearance.

The main terminal is rows and
rows of fruits and vegetables. At
one place we chose between wet
Californian and dry Mexican
lettuce—somewhere between the
cheapest and the most expensive.

expected for that time of morning.

“Hey, did you watch MASH?”
one bearded fruit worker kept
asking everyone who walked by.

We headed back toward the van,
walking through the center of the

turnips and green beans and several

different varieties of onions.

“Look,” I said to Maggie, when
we passed a bushel basket of small,

An SGB approval vote for the
plan will initiate the- procedure.

Kearney said he expects at least
seven of the 21 groups that did not.
receive CSO recognition last week
to ﬁle appeals with SGB.

SGB President Barry Weisband
said a formal appeals procedure is

necessary because of the Board's

tight ﬁnancial situation. ‘.‘We get
$280,00 from the Student Activities
fees. Our request forfunding from
groups tops $450,00. That forces
us to evaluate the status and
funding of student groups more
carefully,” Weisband said.
Groups that have their status as
a student organization revoked are
not eligible for any funds though
the Student Government alloca-
tions process. Student groups with
partial recognition are eligible for
$100 in funding, and groups with
full recognition are eligible for
whatever amount the allocations

It was a night of sweetly ‘sad

Much of it was intimate

whose ideas solidilied more in the

i calm, understated social criticism of

it was like a summertime folk
lcstival, with Oresick chanting
old-world religious prayers, mixed
with poems of immigration and

But his poiiitwas brought home,
touching the cord of simple idealism

Liza &Dad Teamiin ‘Time’  

BY M.C. PILECKI

Ever watch one of those
vintage Hollywood musicals and.
mumble, “They don't make them
like that anymore?" Well, A Matter
of Time is a good reason why not.

Atﬁrst, the plot synopsis sounds
like a good idea for a Fellini movie.
A naive country girl (Liza Minnelli)
comes to Rome in 1949 to work with

her cousin as a chambermaid in ad I

rundown hotel that was once a
landmark of European society. A"
real bumpkin, she’s awed bynher
new surroundings’ and eventually
comes under the spell of another
decaying old landmark, the Con-
tessa (Ingrid Bergman), who inher
day was the sort of dashing young
wo_man they called .“'an adventur-
ess.” I

From before ‘the turn of the
century into the 1920s, she counted
among her lovers the greatest
artists, richest men. and most
powerful leaders. Now she lives in
poverty, in a_ ‘fantasy world
inhabited by all her old memories
and cpnquests. She turns her
talents into making the chamber-
maid a worthy heir to her
“happiness and suffering, ” and the
girl becomes wrapped up in the
Contessa’s world to the point» of
entering her fantasies and taking
them as her own. ‘

Sounds pretty heavy, huh?

Then throw in a sappy subplot

about a third-rate movie writer

 

Bill Nelson can be described as a

' romantic poet who is trying to make
his craft possible in the “neon'

world.” Be-Bop Deluxe’s two lates
LPs have illustrated his triumphant
effort.

As lead vocalist, sole composer, .

guitarist and coproducer, Nelson is
excellent. However, the three

steady and well-‘disciplined music- v

ians who assist him justify these
not being “Bill Nelson” albums.
The lyrics are so thoroughly

modernized romantic poetry that a,

strong case could be made for
Nelson being a reincarnation of
Percy Shelley." The images are
drawn from the amorphous: lightr,
water, clouds, sky, moon and stars.

The themes are romantic favorites,
vascillating between disenchant-

ment with contemporary society‘

and‘ the quest for spiritual rebirth

through love. . ,
‘ "Enhancing the romantic parallel

is the music, a synthesis of sounds

' to aid the lyrics, in mood-making‘.

not from .a traceable line of
ancestors but whirling out of the
entire musical spectrum.

Although Nelson uses his own
brand of melodic rock as a -base, we
hear electronic, jazz, disco, classi-
cal .and '_Latin American music
skillfully "blended ‘in. Progressive
production techniques allow for
even more variation, creating many
new sounds out of‘old ones. I A

Change is the key feature in
Nelson’s musical philosophy. He
changes melody and rhythm, from
song to song as well as within each
song, as often as possible without
disturbing the continuity and ﬂow
that he miraculously manages to
retainl This _makes for lively,-
(spellbinding albums and, ultimate-
ly, exceptional ones.

The previous LP, Sunburst
Finish, is as full of variety as an

album can be while still demon- .

strating a consistent group style.
Unlike most composers, Nelson
writes lyrics first and music
second. He is a poet reaching into
music for a fresh poetic device. But
he never forgets that musical poets
must move the body as well as the
spirit.

The electric guitar, getting
‘rather stone-bound in rock’n roll, is
given a new role in Be-Bop Deluxe. ’
It is not only a mainstay in the
rhythm and melody, but often lurks
beneath and between; the music.

I’ve always had plenty to say!
about Ringo’s albums, having come ,

of age when the Beatles ruled the
world.  _

His‘ first real album, Ringo, (the
previous two I melted over the stove
the day I_ bought them), was a huge
success merely because John, Paul
and George propped the whole
thing up. .

increasing the mysterious intricacy
he quests.

“Fair Exchange” and “Blazing
Apostles” come close to being rock
songs but are too full of ﬂuctuation
and melody. “Heavenly Homes,”
“Crying To The Sky,” and
“Crystal Gazing” are mood songs,
each more thematic and poetic than
the rockers. The others defy
description being so different as to
deﬁne themselves. ,

Testifying to Nelson’s credibility
as an artist and perfectionist is his
refusal to fall back on any “by the
book” standbys on either album.

, For instance, a song never ends in

the worn out Motown fashion of
fading away into emptiness.
Nelson will cleverly go into the next
piece, strike up a ﬂurry of electric
sounds or a guitar riff or raise the
chorus up into a closing ﬁnale. His
endings are so new and amusing in
themselves that the albums could
be praised on their merits alone.

Modern Music, the newest.

release, is an extension of Sunburst
Finish. So congruent are the two
that they could pass for partners in
a two-record set. However, there
are subtle but important differenc-
es between them. '

First, the breadth of variation
has decreased. Be-Bop Deluxe is

(Continued from Page 10)
the hand-clapping-friends-justsit-
ting-around-the-studio style that

. ran throughout his first two albums.

And speakingof friends, he sticks
with the same personnel (Jim
Keltner,‘ Harry Nilsson, Klaus
Voorman, Vini Poncia, producer
Arif Mardin), then adds some big
names (Eric Clapton, Peter Framp-

ton, Melissa Manchester, Danny ,

“Kootch” Korchmar).
What emerges in a‘ blockbuster
album, if only for the pop set.
“Cookin (In the _Kitchen of
Love), ’ ’ Lennon’si contribution, is

good, but certainly the weakest of _i

the three “Beatle” tracks-. It’s an

easy rockerftailor-made for Ringo .

and the strong female backup he's

- accustomed to working with.
McCartney’s “Pure Gold” is-

better, using a strong melodic line
and a touch of instrumentation. The

tune is best described as an early.

60s ballad. Paul -and Linda

provide harmonious supportive

vocals. ‘ ‘
Better than that is Harrison’s

“I’ll Still Love You,” a wailing I

blues song in the vein of ‘ ‘While My

' Guitar Gently Weeps. ” A character

by the name of _Lon Van Eaton is
given the guitar crediton this one,

but we’ve been fooledby the.

Beatles before, and this is so purely
Harrison, it’s a wonder they let him
be disguised in the credits. _

The surprise cut on the album is
“This Be Called a Song” by Eric

Clapton. Clapton writing for Ringo 1 _

Starr? ‘It’s hard picturing Clapton
doing this one himself, Ringo seems
such a natural in it. Like
McCartney’s, Clapton uses a strong
melody, and, of course, his own
brand of gutsy guitar. The most
fascinating sound in the whole
song, though, is Robert Green-
idge’s steel drums; he gives a fresh,
exotic performance that should not

be overlooked when it comes time to‘

choose a single release.
And that’s justphalf the album.

A The other half »_doesn’t‘ boastthe
names, orjthe familiar styles,‘ but- it .

still bursting with fresh material,
but the pieces are noticably alike
and .the scope of experimentation
has. narrowed. Logically, this
album should have preceded

Sunburst Finish. _
Secondly, the themes have

become the theme. Nelson wants
to talk about love (or the lack of it),
and submerges himself in it. He
approaches the subject from many
perspectives, but considering the

musical diversity of the ﬁrst album, «

we miss it on the second.

A. decentralization of theme
would help Be-Bop-Deluxe main-
tain the high standards established

- on Sunburst Finish.

Finally, Nelson is experimenting
with shorter songs. There are 15
on Modern Music. In a way this
represents a backward progression
for the band. Shorter numbers give
more opportunity for variety, but
really don’t add anything new to
the album. An obvious attempt at
newness like this appears beneath
Nelson’s dignity in light of the
subtlety of Sunburst Finish.

In. the ﬁnal analysis, though,
modern Music is as praiseworthy

as Sunburst Finish. It is the second-

course of Bill Nelson’s current
specialty, the only problem is we
are getting a ﬁt full. A The next
Be-Bop-Deluxe album will be
following two hard acts, and Nelson
can't get out of the difficulty by
dishing up a_ third course of the
same stuff. We Air-Age folk
demand constant newness, even
within the context of a progressive
genre, even from a -modern
romantic musical poet. '

BY STEVE SYBERT
Sports Editor

Though Pitt Head coach Johnny
Majors admits he is not a man of
supcrlatives, he expressed many
after the Panthers' 36-19 victory
over the Miami Hurricanes at Pitt
Stadium Saturday.

"Under the circumstances, I
think this is the finest hour for our
coaching staff and the team that
we've had," Majors said.
"Certainly we have an outstanding
_team with everyone together and
everybody well, but under the
circumstances, when our conﬁ-
dence was being shaken, we did the
things our team and our staff knew
iliey had to do and it worked out as
well as I could ever anticipate it or
hope for." j ' ,

The “circumstances" of which
Majors speaks, of course, are the
injuries to his top two quarterbacks,
Robert Haygood and Matt Cava-
natigli, and the having to go with .a
tliird—stringer, Tom Yewcic, whom
he selected just prior to gametime,
an untested and inexperienced,
though very capable, performer.

"Didn't he do a nice job?”
Majors questioned reporters after
the win.-

“That's what everybody aims

for;-the high. left "corner," Roccon ‘

said. ‘‘It couldn't have gone\in any

And Pearson,couldn't have tried

harder, chasing the ball‘ down the’

right wing. Although he didn't get
an assist on the game-winning goal
(his pass was deﬂected by an Indian
player), he performed well and even
had a partial breakaway that was
foiled by an Indiana tripping‘
pen alty——o'r at least what looked like
an obvious Indian penalty. Instead,
the referee judged that he slipped
instead of tripped, and play went on
without a whistle.

The offense passed and ran well i

in the _wet weather, especially
Alfredo Woodman, who subbed in

and out of the match. Playing on the s

right side of the offensive line in the

Dorsett, Yewcic Shine

BY RON SIEGEL

Johnny Majors had been
trying to get his second stringers in
all season. Each time the Panthers
came up against a supposedly weak
foe, everybody ﬁgured it was time
for,a romp. Nobody "expected
second stringers to play Saturday,
what with Miami being the
toughest home game on the
schedule before the quarterback
crisis.

But ironically, this was the game
when Majors got to clear his bench.
Senior Tom Yewcic, Pitt’s newest
scholarship player, performed ad-
mirably, and, with the rest of the
squad matching Yewcic’s perfor-
mance, the Panthers rolled over the
Hurricanes, 36-19.

“I don't want to be overly
dramatic,” said a beaming Johnny
Majors in the Pitt locker room,
“But under the circumstances, we
never had a quarterback perform,
,better.” '

Showing no signs of the
jitteriness that marred his per-
formance in the soggy Louisville
game last week, Yewcic handled
every snap from center John Pelusi

‘ﬂawlessly. His handoffs to the
backs, especially Tony Dorsett,
were equally effective.

“We put some points on the
board this week," said Yewcic as
he emerged from the training
room, remembering that the
Panthers went scoreless in the
second half against Louisville.
“We just took it to them.”

Despite a published report
Friday that Yewcic was going to
start, the Conemaugh, Pa., native
says he didn't know it until just
before gametime. “Coach Majors
asked me ifl was ready to go and I
said ‘yes sir,’ " Yewcic said. “He
said, ‘Good, you're starting.’ ”

Yewcic’s top priority was getting
the ball to Dorsett, who’s now 95%
recovered from the bruised leg he
injured in the Temple game.
Working out of the Veer and I
formations, Dorsett romped for 227
yards and two touchdowns on 35
carries and scored another six-
pointer on a 40-yard screen pass.

“All you need is one day to get
used to a new quarterback,” said
Dorsett, who pulled towithin 151
yards of Archie Grifﬁn’s career

rushing mark of 5,177 yards.

“There was no difference in our
exchanges at all.”

Yewcic’s two completed passes
were big ones. A 38-yarder to Jim

Corbett in the second quarter set
up a Carson Long ﬁeldgoal that
gave Pitt a 12-0 lead. His 40-yard
screen pass to Dorsett, on which
Tony cut across ﬁeld as only he can
do, gave Pitt a 22-0 lead.
Despite Yewcic’s heroics, it was
Dorsett who stood out most. His

sixth career 200-yard game and.

14th straight 100-yard contest give
notice that the “Hawk" is back.

Grifﬁn's record will fall, either at
Navy Saturday or at home against
Syracuse the following week.
Battling Southern California's
Ricky Bell for the Heisman Trophy,
Dorsett can't be concerned about
doing it before the home fans.

“You got to be kidding me,
man," Dorsett said in response to a
reporter’s.question about whether
he'd come out of the Navy game
when he got close to the mark.
“I'm not pulling myself out of no
game. '

“I would preferably like to break
the record here,” he added, “This
year more than ever our fans are
behind us 100%.

It will be Yewcic getting Dorsett

the ball against Navy. Asked_if
he thought he would start
Saturday, Yewcic just shrugged his
shoulders. But it’s really not going
tovbe any secret this week.

“If there ever was a Heisman
Trophy winner—under the circum-
stances, Tony Dorsett played better.
and was more valuable even when
we needed him worse," Majors
said. “When we had a third team
quarterback, he had his greatest.
day, under the circumstances, and
I'd say the greatest day of any back
that I've seen, under the circum-

stances, period, pro or college 0

Majors is proud and very

delighted with the win, “under the
circumstances," of course.

Pitt sweeps Lock Haven,
Falls To MSU’s Broom

BY JIM GEFSKY

The Pantherette netters play-
ed two matches Saturday and
swept two opponents. Unfortu-
nately, one was not a tennis team,
but a tennis court.

The maintenance crew was_

forced to get the stadium into
shape for the football game, so the
netters were forced to seep the wet
spots themselves. The only
opponent they could not sweep was
Michigan State, to whom they lost,
6-3. Pitt countered with a 5-3
victory over'Lock Haven State.
The netters’ first match was
against Michigan State, Pitt’s
toughest opponent to date. MSU is
undefeated and showed” Pitt why.
Pitt’s Maria Paris, whose timing
and service were both somewhat

=off, was defeated by Jodi Ross and

her volleys, 7-5, 6-3. Nancy
Ballistreri and Dane Frey could win
only ﬁve games between them.
Jan Irwin, the recently electd
captain, was defeated by Mary
Hicks 6-3, 6-4; but had Jan not
broken her racquet at the start of
the match_, she might well have
been the victory.

But Pitt also. had its moments
when ‘Pam Bachman defeated
Kathy Salvadore 6-2, 1-6, 6-1, and

when Janet DeCostro beat Cindy

Bogdonas, 7-6, 6-3. DeCostro was
faced with set point in the first set,
yet took the next ﬁve points and the
set 7-6.

Going into the doubles, Pitt still
had a chance if they could win all
three doubles matches. "All the
nettersucould manage was a 6-3, 3-6
7-5 victory by Paris and DeCostro,
over Ross and Diane Selke. The
teams of__Ballistreri-Irwin and
Bachman,-Terry Lies, could muster
only seven games."

“Pitt's a much improved team

since last year;” MSU coach Elaine ‘

Hatton I said. “They're good
competitors and they’re well
coached. We played very well,
especially since we're not used to
your slower courts. I was very
impressed by Jodi's (Ross) game.
It was a good match,_ and it was
closer than the scores indicated..”.

“They're a good solid team with
more ﬁnesse, and more experience
than us," .said Pitt coach Nancy
"' We’re still a new team,
and, although we had a good week
of practice, we still have a lot of
work to do. I was especially
pleased with Janet (DeCostro) and
Maria’s (Paris) doubles victory,
because it's the ﬁrst time they ever
played together,” she said.

The netters shouldn_’t feel
disappointed over that defeat. " It

, _was their ﬁrst taste "of .class

competition this year, and, all
things considering, they handled it
quite well.

The netters had a two-hour rest
before the Lock Haven match, and
while they were resting,_ MSU beat

7 Lock Haven 7-2.

As the match began the sun went
down, making an already freezing
day even colder. But the play of
the netters (5-3) against Lock
Haven, (no patsy at 6-2) was bright

~?§ 

enough to more than compensate *"‘A“

for the sun's absence.

DeCostro was again a straight-
‘set (6-4, 6-4_) winner, this time over
Cindy Stopper. Paris regained her
winning ways as she downed the
other stopper sister, Debbie, 7-5,
7-6. Irwin, in a close match, beat
Cathy Peterman 7-6, 6-4. As was
DeCostro in the MSU match, Irwin
was down 0-4 in the ﬁrst set
tiebreaker, but came roaring back
to take the set. Bachman polished
off Kelly Gohn 3-6, 7-5, 6-2, as
Gohn appeared to wear herself out
in the ﬁnal set.

Among the less fortunate netters
were Frey, who was overcome by
Patty Clark 5-7, 6-3, 6-0; and lies
who lost to Donna Tyler 6-3, 5-7,
2-6. Both appeared to be
concentrating too hard and overly
defensive in their third sets.

The netters clinched the victory
when the doubles team of Irwin and

» Bachman trounced Gohn and Clark

6-3, 7-5. Lies and Jan Brownstein

§\,

were not quite as well off, as they ‘

lost in straight sets. The netters
actually beat Lock Haven, 5-3-1,
because the neck-and-neck doubles
match pitting DeCostro and Paris
and the Stopper sisters was called
on account of darkness. Each team
had won an overtime set.

Ballistreri did not see action in
this match as she sustained a slight
knee strain between matches. She
will probably be x-rayed today, and
her status for the Indiana match is
questionable;

“It was a good "match, and both
teams played as I thought they
would," Lock Haven coach Mary
Breid said. “Despite our loss I’m
pleased with our performance. I'm
sure that the cold weather
hampered both teams."

Their rec ord is now 4-1, and 

their next match is against Indiana
(University of Pennsylvania) at
Trees Courts tomorrow.

U.S. Steel. Consolidation Coal and Mellon Bank

The Student Committee to Defend Dr. Paul Nyden believes that several members of the Pitt Board of Trustees have
played a major role in Dr. Nyden’s firing. We believe this, first, because Dr. Nyden’s research and teaching strongly supports the
labor movement. Dr. Nyden has worked with the miners’ rank—and-file movement since 1970 and is a Co—editor of Miner's Re-
port, a newspaper which reaches 6,000 miners from ‘Pittsburgh to Birmingham. His Ph.D. thesis, Miners for Democracy, was.
awarded with distinction by Columbia University in 1974. ’ ‘

Because of the nature of his work, Dr. Nyden has incurred the wrath of certain coal and steel corporations. These
same coal and steel corporations—Conso|idation Coal and United States ’Steel—have their top executives sitting on our Board of
Trustees at Pitt. The record shows that thesecorporations follow policies that oppose militant rank-and-file unionism, that dis-'
criminate against Black and women workers, and that violate federal health and safety laws. Consolidation Coal has one of the
worst safety records of any coal company in theU.S.; 78 coal miners were killed in 1968 at its Mannington Mine because of
poor safety conditions. U.S. Steel's record of discrimination against Black and women workers was documented in the Fairfield

' decision and its pollution policy is well known. ' ~

For a profile) of some of our Trustees:

POSVAR—Chancellor Wesley Posvar received his B.S. from West Point in 1946. During the Cold War, he taught Political Science
*7 ‘at the Air Force Academy. In 1965, he received his Ph.D. at Harvard as a Littauer Fellow; the LittauervFoundation has served as
a conduit for‘ funds from the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). He has long been connected with the RAND Corporation,
which does studies’ for the CIA. As a Colonel in the Air Force, he acted as an”observer” in Southeast Asia from 1965 to 1967.
In 1967, he left Vietnam to become Chancellor of Pitt. Posvar is a member "of the advisory board of Mellon Bank and Eastern
Airlines. He is currently a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, the No. 1 foreignpolicy think—tank controlled by the
Rockefellers and once headed by Henry Kissinger. » “

REA_—Wil|iam H. Rea, Chairman of the Pitt Trustees, sits on the Board) of Mellon Bank. He is also a Director of Colt Industries
which produces military hardware——‘IVl—16 rifles, grenade launchers, and military handguns—for the Pentagon. A Director of the
Phelps Dodge, he began his career in Chilean copper. V ’

_ DORSEY—Bob R. Dorsey wasrecently removed as Chairman of Gulf Oil for paying corporate bribes to Senator Hugh Scott and
9 Senator Henry Jackson. He still sits on the Board of- Directors of Mellon Bank, Allegheny-Ludlum Steel and General Foods )of
which Burger Chef is a subsidiary). V '
HlGGlNS—James H. Higginsis Chairman of the Board of Mellon Bank and also sits on the Board of Gulf Oil. Gulf Oil owns the
I . largest non-union coal mine in Pennsylvania. ‘

STlNSON—George A. Stinson is Chairman of National Steel,_which owns the biggest non-union steel mill (Weirton, W. Va.) in

Flu Shots
Gaining
Acceptance

BY THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

Health officials say they note
more public acceptance of the swine
ﬂu vaccine program after a sharp
drop following the reports of 35
deaths among persons who received
the shots. 7

!Meanwhile, nearly all of the
clinics giving out the shots were to
be back in operation today.

The officials said the number of
persons receiving swine ﬂu vaccina-
tions began to increase late last
week after a sharp decline following
the reports of the deaths.

Federal health officialssay the
vaccine had nothing to do with the
deaths.

Nine states canceled their
innoculation programs after the
deaths in Pennsylvania of three
elderly persons who had received

the vaccine. All of the states later E"

announced the resumption of the
program and almost all of the public
health centers involved were to
resume the‘shots today.

On Friday, the Center for Disease
Control reported that the vaccine
was not responsible for the deaths
of 35 mostly elderly people who died
after receiving the shots.

_ “It is clear to us that there is no »
basis'to conclude that there is any

increased mortality because of the
ﬂu shot program,” said Dr. J.
Donald Miller of the ‘CDC. .

In Pennsylvania, health officials
reported a sharp decline‘ in the
number of persons getting the shots
shortly after the death reports, but
by the end of the week the rate was
rising. _ -
Ofﬁcials in some states, including
Wyoming, Kansas, Montana and
Maryland, said the innoculation
program ran on schedule last week.

Millar said more than 2.5 million
persons were vaccinated by Wed-
nesday of last week.

Some state healthofﬁcials said
they were concerned that publicity
following the deaths mightlfrighten
people into avoiding innoculation.

CDC’s Miller has praised those
states that continued the program
despite the reports of deaths from
18 states.

He said the CDC expected reports
of -deaths among persons who
received the vaccine. “We

anticipated this problem and set up

a monitoring system.”

But he conceded the CDC might
have underestimated the effect
publicity about deaths might have
on the program.
