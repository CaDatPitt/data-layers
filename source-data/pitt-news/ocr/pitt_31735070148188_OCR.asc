Earthquake
disrupts
study  
abroad
plans

Amy Friedenberger
Senior Staff Writer

Tom Fulks has wanted to study
abroad ever since he came to Pitt.
“It has been my dream to spend
a semester abroad for a long time,”
Fulks, a junior majoring inJapanese,
said. “Foreign languages, especially
those that use neither the Latin al-
phabet nor the same word order as
English, are very difﬁcult to master
without a period of immersion.”
Fulks planned to "study at Rit-
sumeikan University in Kyoto,Japan,
during the school’s spring semes-
ter, which began in late March. But
now, following the 9.0—magnitude
earthquake that ravaged parts of the
country on March 11, Fulks has had

to postpone his plans —— and he’s not .

alone.

Pitt canceled the study abroad
trips of six students who planned
to travel to Japan for the spring se-
mester. Currently, the future of Pitt
programs inJapan remains uncertain
as the earthquake-induced nuclear
crisis in the country continues. The
cancellation leaves the six students
scrambling to rearrange their aca-
demic and study abroad plans.

Holocaust

At a time when there are few sur-
vivors left to share their stories
about the Holocaust, Linda Hur-
witz has made it her mission to
pass along her parents’ story.
Last night in David Lawrence
Hall, the former director of the
Holocaust Center of the United
Jewish Federation of Pittsburgh

shared stories of her parents’ ‘

hardships and losses during
World War II as well as her per-
sonal experiences as the child of
Holocaust survivors.

About 50 people attended the
event,which was hosted by Pitt’s
Jewish sorority Alpha Epsilon Phi
and Jewish fraternity Alpha Epsi-
lon Pi. The Hillel Jewish Univer-
sity Center Student Board also
joined in hosting Hurwitz in hon-
or of Holocaust Remembrance
Day, scheduled for May 1. 

Hurwitz shared a story about
her mother, Irene Furst, escap-
ing from the Nazis after she’
convinced them that she was
not Jewish. After ﬁnding work
as a nurse in the Polish ghettos,
Furst, a Polish citizen, rebelled?
against the Nazis by stealing food
for her family.

Hurwitz said it was not un-
til she became the director of
the Holocaust Center that she
learned the full extent of her

mother’s trials.

“My mother shares so many
amazing details, but it is getting
harder for her,” Hurwitz said. “I
have heard her stories so many
times that now I try to be her
voice.” ,

Furst was unable to speak at
the event.

Senior Jessica Laiter took
interest in the stories Hurwitz
told.

“It is important to get it out
there so history doesn’t repeat
itself,” she said. “It takes a lot to
tell your story.”

After the speech, the audience
asked questions about Hurwitz’s
mother and the speaker’s own
experiences growing up with Ho-
locaust survivors as parents.

“It was my normalcy —— grow-
ing up with accents and havinglto
translate,” Hurwitz said about

her parents’ struggle to ﬁt into
American society. “There was
sort of a somberness as I was
the firstborn and my parents
were getting used to the Ameri-
can life.”-

Hosting a speaker was not the
only way the University’s Jewish
community honored Holocaust
Remembrance Day.

On Monday night, students
gathered in front of the William
Pitt Union to read the names of
those who died during the Holo-
caust from a book that Heather
Rubin, holidays chairwoman for
Hillel, described as “6 inches
wide.”

“It was the first time I did the
name reading,’_’ freshman Sarah
Winston said. “It was really sad.
I read names of kids who were
2 years old when they died. It’s
hard. Some families just have last

names because their first names

have been erased.” -
After the reading, students

walked in silence and held signs ,

that read, “Never Forget.”

David Kugelman, sophomore
and member of Alpha Epsilon Pi,
said that now is a good time for
memorials because it is close to
the anniversary of the Warsaw
Ghetto Uprising, ajewish upris-
ing in the Warsaw Ghetto-that
took place from April to May of
1943 and resulted in more than
10,000 deaths.

Students agreed on the impor-
tance of talking about the histo
of the Holocaust. -

“I think that the Holocaust is a
fascinatingly unfortunate experi-

ence,” sophomore Erin Doppelt.

said. “Since there are so few sur-
vivors, I want to learn what I can
while they are still alive.”-

Student earns national scholarship

Tegan Hanlon
Senior Staﬁ" Writer

Pitt student Wen Xu’s daily balanc-
ing act of schoolwork, lab research
and volunteering has not gone un-
noticed.

Xu, an Honors College junior
majoring in neuroscience, received
a 2011 Barry M. Goldwater Schol-
arship last month. The nationally
competitive scholarship is awarded
to students who are pursuing ma-
jors in mathematics, science or
engineering.

She is the 35th Pitt student to
receive the scholarship, which is
worth $7,500 and funds senioryear
expenses.

Judy Zang, director of national
scholarships at the Honors Col-
lege, commended Xu on her work

both inside and outside of the
classroom.

“She represents the best of Pitt’s
students. But the neat thing about
Wen is she’s not just super in work-
ing in the forefront of the ﬁeld in
her research, but she is also con-
nected to the Pitt community in her
leadership activities,” Zang said.
“What also made Wen an outstand-
ing candidate for this award was
that she not only demonstrated a
unique understanding of the dif-
ferent technologies involved in her
research, but a genuine excitement
about the possibilities of collabora-

tive research on peripheral nerve _

repair across the sciences.”-

To receive the scholarship, stu-
dents ﬁrst had to be nominated by
their university. Zang said a cam-
pus selection committee made up

of faculty representatives chose
four nominees from Pitt to go on
to the national scholarship com-
petition. J

“I was very surprised actually,”
Xu said about receiving the scholar-
ship. “I was pretty much happy with
the fact that I had made it past the
University round. Receiving this is
quite an honor.” if

Xu, from Mccandless Township
in Allegheny County, plans to enroll
in medical school after graduation
from Pitt and hopes to pursue a
career in translational neurosci-
ence or neurobiology. She took the
MCATs two weeks ago. ,_

will be really important when I ap-

Although the students were notified
on March 17 that the programs were
‘suspended, the April e-mail deﬁni-
tively cancels the spring term study
abroad programs. ,

Juan Manfredi, vice provost for
undergraduate studies, said the
University’s priority in canceling the
programwas maintaining the safety
of its students. _

Manfredi said that Pitt ﬁrst looks
at the U.S. Department of State’s trav-
el warnings when dealing with inter-
national issues. Patricia Beeson, pro-
vost and senior vice chancellor, then
makes the ﬁnal decision concerning
student placement based on an ag-
gregation of information regarding
the situations in the countries.

“We have to consider what might
happen to the students once they
are there,” Manfredi said. “We opted

to be cautious in this case, because
we really believe that the situation
is not safe.” —

The suspension on all study
abroad programs inJapan will hold
until Pitt determines the region to be
safe enough for its students. Man-
fredi said that as more information
becomes available about the situation
inJapan, Beeson will change the sta-
tus of the study abroad programs.

The Department of State ﬁrst is-
sued a travel warning March 16, ad-
vising U.S. citizens to defer travel to

Japan and recommending that those

in Japan consider departing. The
warning came amid concerns that
at least one ofJapan’s nuclear power

With one meeting left this year, SGB is optimistic

Board members talk up Pitt Day in Harrisburg, other advocacy efforts in the face of education funding cuts

Marissa Meredyth
Senior Staff Writer

Student Government Board presi-
dent Molly Stieber began the sec-
ond to last board meeting of the
semester last night by once again
acknowledging student efforts
in the battle against proposed
funding cuts to education. _

“We’ve made a difference, but
it’s not yet over,” Stieber said.

The Board ‘canceled last
week’s meeting because of a lob-
bying trip to Harrisburg. The trip
brought students from across
Pennsylvania to speak out against
Republican.Gov. Tom Corbett’s
proposed budget cuts to higher
education.. .

The cuts are a part of Corbett’s
ﬁrstbudget, which he proposed
in early March. The budget in-
cludes more than $900 million
in cuts to higher education, in-
cluding a 50 percent reduction
in Pitt’s state allocations, which
will fall from about $160 million
to $80 million. T

 

It is now up to legislators
to propose‘ amendments to the
budget, which has a deadline of
June 30.

Stieber said that previous ral-
lies and Pitt’s student-led letter-

writing campaign all culminated '

in the lobbying effort in Harris-
burg. Even so, she stressed that
the letter-writing campaigns at
Pitt will continue and that stu-
dents should still visit their rep-
resentatives.

She also talked about her
-meeting with Corbett’s chief of
staff, William Ward. Stieber said
Ward appeared sympathetic to
the student cause, and like oth-
ers in the state capital, he said
it was likely that Pitt and other
institutions will get some of the
cut funding back. V

“Even a 25 percent cut would

be unprecedented,” Stieber said -

after the meeting adjourned. ‘
Board member John Hasely

agreed that Pitt Day achievedﬁ

its goals. He congratulated Kyle
Miller, S_GB_ governmental rela-
tions chairman, on a “successful

day.”

said.

It was the summer after her. freshman
year when Xu ﬁrst applied to the Childrens
Hospital of Pittsburgh’s Summer Student
Research Training Program and was paired
up with Dr. Yong Li in his laboratory of mo-
lecular pathology.

After the Children’s Hospital moved to
Lawrenceville, Li’s lab stayed at Pitt, so Xu
was able to remain on campus to continue

       
      

her research.

“I was very lucky,” she said.

In the lab, Xu currently works on a sig-
naling project, which focuses on the nerve
aspects of functional recovery.

“If you injure the muscle and the nerve,
how do you get the [nerve] to reintegrate
with the muscle target?” This was the driving
question behind the study, she said.

The team works to isolate sources of stem
cells and muscles that could be stimulated
to differentiate —— allowing them to aid in

Xu said she spends about ﬁve hours a
week in the lab during the school year and
works there full time over the summer.

Li described Xu as “smart and easygo-
ing.”

“She is very friendly to all other lab per-
sons,” he said.

Outside of the lab, Xu is the co—executive

After Fu heard that Xu received the Gold-

“Knowing that he was so accomplished,
he was very chill and laid back,” Xu said. “If I

The six students were not able to enroll in
the spring semester at Pitt because the term
was already halfway done by the time they
were notiﬁed of the suspension of their stud
abroad programs. ‘

If students decide to study abroad despite
the cancellations, they will not be able to go
through Pitt. Instead, theywill have to enroll di-
rectly at thejapanese university of their choice
and will have to reapply to Pitt as a transfer
student.

Transfer credits earned while abroad are
treated the same way as credits earned while
studying at a university in the United States.

Must prioritize

Last—minute pressure is one of the
most valued resources among Pitt
essay writers.

As pressing as term paper dead-
lines can seem, students often
choose to let them fall out of con-
sciousness until the night before
or morning of.But as a new study
out of Syracuse University reminds
us, opening a fresh Microsoft Word
document two hours before a 10-
page paper is due is not the real
problem; it’s that college students
are largely ignorant as to why extra
time should matter. That is, essay
writers don’t assign enough pri-
ority to two essential processes:
researching topics and integrat-
ing that research into their essays.
Given the growing importance of

evidence-based reasoning in our‘

discourse, a shift in priorities is in
order, and the Pitt undergraduate
experience should adapt to encour-
age this.

TheJCitation Project, a study
that analyzed 164 research papers
from ﬁrst-year English composi-
tion courses at 15 colleges, strongly
suggests that in general, college
students don’t know how to prop-
erly ﬁnd sources nor integrate
those ideas in writing.

Out of the papers 164 it re-
viewed, the study found that more
than half of citations referred to
documents ﬁve pages or less in
length, and that about 75 percent
of citations referred to information
that was clearly gleaned from the
ﬁrst three pages of original text.»
Additionally, the study found that
91 percent of citations took forms
that didn’t reﬂect original compo-
sition on the student’s part (i.e.,
students either copy-and-pasted
verbatim, minimally altered cop-
ied material or paraphrased a small
portion of text).

Classifying one citation as para-

sourcing acumen

phrase and another as original
composition carries obvious lev-
els of subjectivity, but for however
limited the study’s implications
are, the general point still remains
— the citizens of the future ought
to know how to make sense of pri-
mary sources.

In this department, Pitt could
and should do a better job.

Don’t get us_ wrong. In terms of
overall research gravitas, the Uni-
versity has made huge strides in
recent decades — research spend-
ing at Pitt rose from $9,000 per
student in 1993 to about $21,000
per student in 2007, according to a
study that the Goldwater Institute
published last year..

But as bountiful and world-
renowned as Pitt’s expanding re-
search might be, that doesn’t mean
students are making the most of
such research for their papers. We
believe that any explosion of new
knowledge akin to Pitt’s ought to
accompany a proportional explo-
sion of knowledge-synthesis skills.
Pitt should do more to ingrain in
students not only the importance,
but also the practice of evidence-
based reasoning.

Our start to a solution: Pitt
should open a ﬁrst-year Seminar
in Composition class devoted en-
tirely to the underappreciated art
of research papers.

Because, come on, it’s danger-
ous to assume that the skills of
gathering and integrating sourc-
es should be left to far-away high
school curricula, especially as the
nature of information changes
almost daily. And because im-
pressing budget—cutting legisla-
tors lingers in the minds of many
administrators these days, perhaps
now is the perfect opportunity to
ﬂaunt the quality of Pitt’s educa-
tional program. I

Two Pitt students couldn’t take any

classes aboutcraﬂs at Pitt, butthey did
learn about them working on a new
exhibition in the Carnegie Museum of
Art.
Jennifer Lue and Marie Williams,

both senior art history majors, went
to work as research interns, writing
notes, biographies and a glossary for
an exhibition ofhandmade crafts. The
exhibition, titled “Hand Made: Con-
temporary Craftinceramic, Glass and
Wood”, displays crafts such as a hand-
made teapot and a rocking chair.

“Most of the craft history comes
from some kind of utilitarian or some
kind of functional backgroun ,” she
said, givingthe examples of metalwork

The “Hand Made” exhibit was a

hearabigband rendition of “Oopsl... I
Did ItAgain” played insuccessionwith
1920s classics like “You’re the Cream
in My Coffee.”

Fortunately for musical anachro-
nists across Pittsburgh, Max Raabe
& Palast Orchester are coming to the
Byham Theater on Thursdayto deliver
theirblend of cabaret and dance band
jazz. The Palast Orchester combines
the upbeat sound of cabaret music -
think of the Cantina from Star Wars
— with pop music from throughout

the 20th century.

Singer Raabe tapped fellow stu-
dents at the Berlin University of the
Arts to assemblehis orchestrain1986.
After the group stumbled upon Ger-
mandance band sheet music from the
1920s, they quicklyfellinlovewith “the
most elegant pop music ever,” Raabe
said.‘ The orchestra originally played
only cabaret and dance band classics,
butsoonRaabe beganwritinghis own
pieces and reinterpreting modern pop
songs in the classic style.

Despite its modern ﬂourishes, it
wouldbe easyto mistakethis group for
a dance band from 1920s. Dressed in
the style of the Weimar Republic, the
men wear classic l11XeCl0S and slicked
back hair. The Palast Orchester croons
from behind Art Deco music stands,
hopping up for shout choruses or so-
los.

Trained as abaritone opera singer;
Raabe employs awide variety of tech-
niques in his singing. His vocal range
swings fromthe falsetto twang of early
records to more  notes. He also

delivers snarky quips and dramati
pauses inbetween songs. ‘
Raabe’s comedic delivery is not
just a creative touch, but very much a
part ofthe cabaret style tl1athe andhis
orchestra attempt to revitalize. Leon
Dorsey, Pitt’s coordinator ofjazz stud-
ies, said that comedy is a central part

of the history ofcabaret and modern .

theater.

In the late 19th century, whites
and blacks in blackface performed in
minstrel shows, which blended wise-
crack jokes, music and skits with a
sizable dose of racism. At the turn of
the century, minstrel shows began los-
ing popularity to cabaret shows from
Europe. Drawing from this contro-
versial heritage, cabaret and vaude-
ville performers in the early 1900s
worked political and social satire into
their acts, meanwhile featuring plenty
of scantily clad women to bringinthe
crowds, Dorsey said.

Wagner: More to reggae

than Marley

Patrick Wagner
Columnist

 

For many, the music of and inspired byjamaica
is synonymous with the summer season. All too
often, however, people listen to one or two art-
ists of this style and fail to explore the depth and
originality of music derived from ska, the mother
of the reggae genre.

But before Bob Marley reigned as_]amaica’s
unofficial cultural ambassador, Desmond Dekker
was the name most people associated with the
island’s music. The raucous sound he produced
relied on guitar upstrokes and a syncopated beat
to offset his angelic voice.

The music is a bit rough for the 1960s, even
with the piano and horn section, but Dekker’s
voice comes out like that of a matured schoolboy.
In contrast with the reggae trend toward slower
tempos, the ska of this erawas more closely asso-
ciated with the R&B of Otis Redding, and it really
does rock and sway while  the same
base elements of reggae .

Eventually, Dekker began to associate him-

Nostalgia permeates the indie—pop musings of

and the simplicity of. the country all seem to
ﬁnd their way into the message this quintet
from Washington has for its fans.

from the group’s previously conflicted Let’s

— by reassuring the listener that an overall
theme or message is not alwaysineeded, but

" simplicity and organization can truly convey-

With its latest album Giving E9 Receiving, the ﬁve-member group LAKE has moved away

nostalgic sound.

Despite being primarily recordedand pro-
duced during the days right after the Gulf oil
tragedy, the record’s uplifting theme of real-
izing what we as people are given and how we
can repay this generosity keeps it poignant and
relevant. '

With soaring melodies that surround and
gentle instrumentation that soothes, LAKE’s

sound emphasizes the theme of positivity with- v

out making it feel overdone or forced, and a
touch of soul adds a certain depth to the stan-
dards of pop and rock the band employs.

a hushed calmness about it. More electronic

ents to combine catchiness with meaning. I

the 1960sto2oo9. While otherhandmadepieces

are on display in permanent exhibits in the art v

museum year-round, “Hand Made” allows a
narrow and in-depthfocus onaspan ofso years,
Delphia said.

Lue,whoisalsoanEnglishwritingmajor,said '

in an e-mail that she’s learned not just about how
to put together an exhibit, but also more about
crafts. ,

“Decorativearts doesn’t regularly gettaught at
the undergraduate level here at Pitt  and I think
it often, unfortunately, gets stigmatized as lesser
than “ﬁne arts” like painting and sculpture,” Lue
said. “Working on the “Hand Made” exhibition
helped me understand the amount of sheer labor
and t_echnical skill that goes into creating these
pieces,”

Commandaros agrees with Lue that Pitt does

‘not have classes speciﬁcally targeted at learning

crafts, partly because of resource constraints.

But she said that many classes teach the basics of V

craftwork— such as ceramics and ﬁberwork——

l and that interested students can take a directed

study course with aprofessorto gainskillsinthat
artform. ‘
Asforti1estigmaagainstcrafls,Commandaros
feels thattheartshave comealongway, explaining
thatwhen she_wentto school, shewas not allowed
to majorinboth sculpture and small metals.
“I  my generation and the generations

before me had to really ﬁght for there to be not '

a distinction [between “crafts” and “ﬁne arts”]
within the university settings within academia,”
the professor said.

Delphia said the functionality and common-
nessofcraftsthatmighthavecausedastigmainthe
past can acuiallyhelp people relate to the exhibit.
Most of the material used is ceramic, wood or
glass, with only“trace amotmts’ ’ ofother materials,

explained Delphia. She said that the materials in

es at Carnegie

theexhibitmightbemore“accessible”toviewers g _

than those of other pieces.

“Most of these are mediums we remember
as children in art classes,” Delphia said. “People
haveasense ofwhatclayfeels like. We also have so
many ceramic objects in our lives that we look at

them and appreciatethem as objects and as tools‘

in our homes. This isn’t always the case. There are

things inthe museumyoucanonlyimagine inthe

museum. But these could come home with you.”
Lue and Wlliams were impressed by the tal-

ent on display in the gallery by the end of the ‘

 ;' I
“You havetoperfectthe process, andthattakes

years and years of work and sometimes groups

of people to complete,”- Lue said, explaining that

~ manyartists inthe pasttaughtthernselves howto

work with these mediums because of an overall
lack of education or mentors in the ﬁeld.

“The sheeramountofworkthatgoes intoturn—
ingawoodenbowl or creatinga ceramic vesselis
just mind—blowing,” Williams said. “I deﬁnitely

thinkthatpeople don’tnecessarily appreciate these

mediurnsinthe same mannerthatpeople appreci-
ate paintingorsculpture, because the resultis not
codiﬁed as being exclusively an art object.”

This art exhibit also features interactive tech-
nology. Touch screens similar to those currently
found in the Carnegie Museum of Natiiral His-

Cabaret dampen

Max Raabe 4 8 . A '

siast and choral director for private groups as
well as public schools in Newjersey, said that as
cabaret quickly became the dominant form of

entertainment in America, it grew into an even .
greater sensation overseas. Cabaret originatedas ‘

aform oflate-night entertainment accompanied
by drinking alcohol in France, and soon “spread

g through Europe like crazy,” Larsen said.

. “Cabarets appealed to all pillars of society:
Artistsiwere able to showtheirwork, businesses
loved it because they made a lot of money from

the shows andpeopleloveditbecausetheywere L

gossipingand drinkingandseeingthe poets and
performers,” Larsen said. .

This successful form of entertainment, which.
was apart oftheboomin nightlife knownas the
Roaringzos, soon mettwo grave enemies: Nazis
and Prohibition, according to Larsen. _

ed by Prohibition

Cabaret’s ‘comparatively loose moral stan-
dards lent itselfto debauchery and political criti-
cism and satire. This threatened Nazi rule and
the groups claims of racial purity, so Gerniany’s

thriving “kabarett” scene was suppressed dur- _

ingNazi rule, Larsen said. Likewise, Prohibition
led to a decrease in the motivation for people to
frequent clubs as it became harder to consume
alcohol.

boys,” a group whose members wore sharp suits
— even in the swelteringjamaican heat — and
often involvedthemselves indelinquency around
the culture of sound—system parties— impromptu
parties where hosts play music from cars.

The song “O07” is 1967 classic that not only
formalized Dekker’s associationwiththe rude boy
culture but also introduced him to what would
become one of the biggest markets forjamaican
music ~— the U.K., where the track reached No.
15 on the charts.

WhatDekker didn’tanticipa1:ewasthatinEng—

the 21st century.

WhenMorgan neededabackupbandaround
LA in 2002, two groups the Vessels and the
Rhythm Doctors got together and discovered
that they had a lot in common. They eventually
formed The Aggrolites and have been kicking
out some of the best “dirty reggae” even since.
The phrase is of their own invention, referringto

the fact that their music is “dirty” with different
elements from punk to calypso.

Turn on ‘Mr Misery” from their Hellcat Re-

wonder why this wasn’t the demo for the next

interpretation included.

Late night shows like “Late Night withjimmy
Fallon” incorporate music, skits and short stand-
up acts much like traditional cabaret, Dorsey
noted. Elaborate music videos can combine 
these elements —- plus a dash of those scantily
clad women — to become the most condensed
form of cabaret, Dorsey said.

Because the Palast Orchester is booked at
more reputable establishments than its cabaret
predecessors, Raabe said the group sticks to less
risqué entertainment. While band members do
participate in skits, Raabe limits his commentary
to brief introductions before songs and violinist
Cecilia Crisafulli —_ the only woman on stage —
remains appropriately clothed throughout.

The group’s attention to the stylistic details
of the period it represents has won praise frog;
music critics, but Raabe says his love of pop music
is what drives his performances. Although he has
a preference for the pop music of the early 20th
century, the joy and crowd—pleasing nature of pop
musicthroughoutthe decadeshasfascinatedhim
and his group.

Although Raabe’s acts shed his style’s tra~
ditional political satire for sarcastic one—liners
and puns, the performer maintains the spirit of
earlier cabaret.

“It’s always nice to misbehave in a tuxedo,”
Raabe said.

Pitt gets mixed results in recent matches

Nate Barnes
Staﬁ Writer

Pitt’s tennis team has had a tu-
multuous past two weeks. The young
team bounced from victory to defeat
as it took on local and elite Big East
teams.

Although the Panthers dominat-
ed over Youngstown State and Car-
negie Mellon, they faltered against
Rutgers and Syracuse, making the

gaast two weeks’ play seem incon-
sistent.

But for head coach George Dief—
fenbach, the mixed results and tough
losses are simply because of the
teams on Pitt’s recent schedule.

“It’s not inconsistent play, we
have a top—ﬂight schedule that is
upgraded each year,” Dieffenbach
said. “We play a lot of very talented
teams, and a lot of Big East matches
which is one of the strongest confer-
ences. We have been working hard

-in practice and we have two tough
matches left.” ‘

impressive 6-1 win over Youngstown
State on Wednesday. In doubles play,
senior Elizabeth Adams and sopho-
more Gabrielle Catanzariti won a
close match at ﬁrst doubles, 8-6.

Second doubles was not so close
— the Pitt freshman tandem ofJoc-
elyn Lu and Kimmy Borza ran away
with an 8-3 victory. Third doubles
came down to the last point, as
junior Minh Evans and freshman
Taylor Washington dropped a tough
match, 7-9.

The Panthers’ singles play also
ran roughshod over the Penguins.
Except for a loss by Adams at ﬁrst
singles, Pitt didn’t drop a match in
the category — each of the other ﬁve
matches ended in triumph for Pitt
players. Catanzariti, Lu and sopho-
more Karma Parbhu all won their
matches with little or no contest.

Borza ran into some resistance
at fourth singles and had to play
an extra game to take the ﬁrst set,
7-5. She then gained another hard-
fought set with a score of 6-4. The

,. in/Ionday marked an important day in
 Pitt athletics, as the University hand-
ed out its most prestigious scholar-
athlete awards during the 2011 Senior
Awards Banquet held in the William

Pitt Union.
The David Sandberg Champion,

' “Blue-Gold and the Panther awards

went out to members of a wide range
of Pitt teams. The winners will have
their names etched in stone on the
Varsity Walk between the Cathedral
of Learning and Heinz Memorial
glhapel.

E.J. Borghetti, Pitt’s senior associ-

ate athletic director and the master of

ceremonies for the banquet, said that
while the University hosts hundreds
of athletics-based events each year,
this night is extra special because it’s
one of achievement.

“It’s a night that certainly merits
celebration. It’s certainly one of the
most gratifying events of the year,”
Borghetti said.

Former Pitt quarterback Pat Bo-
stick and men’s basketball center
Gary McGhee were named the Da-
vid Sandberg Champion awardees
because the seniors best represented
the qualities Sandberg exempliﬁed
while he was awrestler at Pitt: dedica-
tion to academic and athletic excel-
lence while striving to improve Pitt
and its nearby communities.

Bostick, who earned his bachelor’s

degree in communications early and
will graduate with another degree in
media and professional communica-
tions laterthis month before goingto
graduate school, played a key role in

“I’ve had an unbelievable oppor-

tunity at Pitt to affect a lot of ki ,”

Bostick said. “It’s bigfor me to show

kids that have dreams how they can

achieve those dreams.”

During his time at Pitt, McGhee
worked to become a premier de-
fensive center. He is one of just 10
Pitt players to collect more than 100
career blocks, ﬁnishing his career
with 1.14. McGhee also started in 68
straight games.

iger of old shwed through at Masters this weekend,

/
MCT Campus

Masters winner Charl Schwartzel (left) donned the honorary green jacket that goes to the tournament’s winner after he won the event Sunday. Tiger Woods (right) came in fourth
after making a strong push for ﬁrst place over the course of the day.

Isaac Saul
Staﬂ" Writer

Ifyou’re here for some Tiger Woods
hate, you can stop reading right now.

When Woods took a break ﬁ‘om
golfduringaﬁve-month self-imposed
hiatus aﬁerword ofhis multiple affairs
surfaced, he seemed to be in no state
of mind to compete at the top of his
game. Butas discussion of his sex ad-
diction and marital discord dissipates,
itseemsthatthefewerpeoplewhotalk
about him, the better he plays.

In perhaps the most mentally chal-
lenging sport in the world, ﬁnding
consistency can neverbe overvalued.

This Sunday at the Masters, the au-
dience actually saw a few glimpses
of the old Tiger, the man who was
arguably the most dominant golfer
the sport has ever seen. Examples:
1) Woods unleashing one of his thun-

sorts lounge

1825 East Carson St.
Pittsburgh, PA 15203

412-390-1910

derous ﬁst pumps after makingaputt
foreagle to leavehimshootingasl on
the front nine. (That’s really good.)
2) He twice held a share
of the lead on Sunday.
3) Woods came into Sunday mom-
ing’s ﬁnal round seven strokes
behind the leader and almost
came back for an epic victory.
In his 14 major victories, Woods
never won from one stroke back on
theﬁnal day of competition, let alone
seven. The fact that he almost did it
this weekend should be an eye-opener
for golfers and fans worldwide.
Woods’ late—toumament presence
is huge for both his conﬁdence and
the fear of his competitors. We’re not
talkingabout some BurgerKingspon-
sored 9—lioletournament—-thisisthe
Masters. This is the tournament in
which golfers havebecome notorious
forbuming, throwing out, compound-
ingandbreakingtheir clubs afterfour

days of excruciatingly tough golfleaves
them one stop short of psychiatric care.

And with Charl Schwartzel’s win,
golfhas now seen 10 different players
win the last 10 majors.

The truth is, we need Woods
back. Golf needs Woods back. He is
still the only man in the world who
can dominate in a way that brings
all kinds of sporting fans to golf.
And I’m here to tell you: The old
Woods is right around the corner.

He did the tough stuff right and
the easy stuff wrong. Which, in my
opinion, is a good sign.

He was able to place the ball on
the green in his ﬁrst eight holes inthe
ﬁnal round, and he also hit six out of
his ﬁrst six fairways.

After abirdie on the seventh hole,
aneagle onthe eighth andapar-saving
pitch out of the sand on the ninth,
Woods was sharing the Masters’ lead
for the ﬁrst time since 2007.

But he was left 3-putting some of
the easiest holes on the course. Maybe
allthe divorcetalkis still getlingto his
short—game, but Woods is slowly and
surely shaking off whatever cobwebs
or mental blocks he had, and he is get-
ting closer and closer to ending his
17-month winless streak.

Despite that streak and his ﬁve-
month leave, the 36-year-old Woods
is still only four major championships
away from Jack Nicklaus’ record.

' And when he ﬁnally does get that
elusive win (which will be soon), how
willAmerica react? Wllhis shiny ﬁrst-
place trophy or a good post-victory
interview draw forgiveness from the
country that has put his personal life
through a paper shredder?

IfAmerica can forgive Woody Al-
len, Kobe Bryant, Bill Cosby (did you
miss that one?), R. Kelly and Mike T‘y-
son’s alleged sexual misdeeds, I think
it can ﬁnd some room to reaccept

Woods. At the end of the day, Woods
just admitted to commitﬁng adultery
in a country where more people will
probably get divorced than vote this
year.
I’d bewillingtobetthatwhen gore

most exhilarating player ﬁnally gets

his swag back with a ﬁrst-place ﬁn-

ish, the sport’s popularity will have a

signiﬁcant and uncoincidental explo-

sion. Don’t believe me? Check outthis

excerpt from a CBS release:

“An estimated 42.3 million view-
ers (Persons 2+) watched CBS Sports’
third— and ﬁnal—round coverage of the
2011 Masters on Saturday, April 9, and
Sunday, April 10, makingitthe second
largest number of viewers to watch’
all—or—part of the network’s weekend
coverage of the Masters in 10 years.”

Like allthe great ones, Woodswill

ally,I’llbegladto seehimthere. 5

After back-to-back losscs‘beforc;°the, 
against Youngstown State,’ the victoty_._gave
the Panthers some momentum before their
Saturday match against Big East powerhouse
Rutgers.

“The win gave us conﬁdence,” Lu said. “We
hadn’t been playing as well as we wanted, so
we really wanted to get a solid win before we
played Rutgers.”

George Dieffenhach:

score sheet, and doubles really could Vhave

Yet after the deﬂating loss, the Pantllcrs
returned to action Wednesday with a 6-3 
over Carnegie Mellon, in large part because

of a dominantvperformance in doubles play.

Each doubles team wori, and three more wins

V in, singles play by Lu, Borza and Evans capped

off the victory arid helped restore the team’s
conﬁdence. ‘pi;  _
“This win was very important for us;'be—
cause Coach George [Dieffenbach] wantcdvus
to get a close win,” Lu said. “All of our matches
have been either us blowing the opponentVout

or getting beaten pretty ba1dly~’*6ui‘sel is.”

 

It’s going to be about the battle,"  
the intensity, giving it our best and
putting matches away. W

As dominant as the Panthers were against
Youngstown State, Rutgers turned the tables
on Pitt, and the Scarlet Knights won by a score
of 6-1 at a neutral site in Morgantown, W.Va.

No Pitt doubles team managed to pick up
a victory, and Rutgers Won the toughly—con-

tested doubles point. Each Panthers doubles V

team pushed its opponent, but none could get

over the hump in the end to pick up a victory.

Adams and Catanzariti at ﬁrst doubles and
Evans and Washington at third doubles both
lost their matches 4-8. At second doubles,
Lu and Borza came the closest to victory, but
they ultimately dropped the match to their
opponents, 5-8.

In singles, the Panthers were less close to
victory. Four of the six singles matches were
lost in straight sets, and most were decided by
a large’ margin. The closest any of the four came
to winning a set was Evans’ 4-6 sixth singles
loss. She then losther second set 1-6. .

Two bright spots in singles play came in the
form of two freshmen who have been two of
the most successful players on the team this
season. Lu, at second singles, won her match in
straight sets, 6-4, 6-3. Borza, at third singles,
put up a valiant effort, but ultimately lost in
three sets. ._

After dgopping the ﬁrst set 3-6, Borza
came back to force a third frame by winning
the second 6-4. She was unable to ﬁnish the
comeback, however, as her opponent held her
comeback and put the match away in Rutgers’
favor. Borza lost 4-6 in the decisive set.

“We went into the match thinking we

could win. We all knew we had a chance to ‘
win,” Borza said. “There were a lot of close ,

Next on the slate was a match against Syra-
cuse. It was a contest the team had been look-
ingforward to all year as the Orange are one of
the best teams in the Big East, and they were
prepared heading into the match last Friday._

“This is the match I’ve been looking for-
ward to the most all year. Syracuse has a great
program,” Borza said. “We have nothing to lose

though, and we are going to go out and attack .

and leave nothing on the court.”

Unfortunately for the Panthers, any mo-
mentum the Panthers may have earned by
defeating Carnegie Mellon didn’t carry over
into the match against Syracuse. TheVOrange
shut the Panthers out 7-0, casting a pall over
the Senior Night celebration forAdams, Adela
Aprodu and Sarah Dieffenbach during the
team’s last home game of the season.

The loss leaves Pitt 8-10 on the season, with
two very tough matches remaining. With its
current record, the team is in serious danger
of ﬁnishing under .500 for the ﬁrst time in
six years — the 2004-05 squad ﬁnished 9-11.
More importantly, if the squad cannot win its
ﬁnal two matches, Pitt might not qualify for
the Big East tournament.

The two remaining matches are a Wednes-
day contest against Big East opponent George-
town and a ﬁnal test against Marshall on Friday
that could land the Panthers in the postsea-
son. V ’

“We are going to give it all we got, and if we
go out and compete hard and pull out a victory,
we stand a great chance to qualify for the Big
East toumament,” Dieffenbach said. “It’s going
to be about the battle, the intensity,  it
our best and putting matches away.” [ C

Smoking? The Univer-

smokers aged 18-65
who are already plan-
ning to quit smoking to
participate in a 9-week
research study on the
short—term effects of
two oral medications
on smoking behavior,
craving, and mood.
One is FDA-approved
for smoking cessation,
Zyban (bupropion),
and the other is FDA-
approved for wakeful-
ness, Provigil
(modaﬁnil). This is
not a treatment study.
You will be asked to
take study medication
that may or may not
contain the active com-
ponents. Research
