Austrian president faces pressure to resign

By Kevin Costelloe
Associated Press Writer

VIENNA, Austria (AP) — Presi-
dent Kurt Waldheim is facing
mounting pressure to resign after
an international" panel of histori-
ans criticized his role as a lieu-
tenant in the German army under
Adolf Hitler.

”A president must be absolute-
ly spotless,” Simon Wiesenthal,
a Vienna-based Nazi hunter, said
Tuesday, in his first call for Wald-
heim to step down since the con-
troversy began in 1986.
Wiesenthal predicted Austria
would ”face hard times” if Wald-
heim sticks by his refusal to step
down.

Among those calling for his
resignation were former Austrian
Chancellor Bruno Kreisky and

Heinz Galinski, the head of West
Berlin's Jewish community.

The calls came as Waldheim,
a former U.N. secretary-general,
was expecting the first state visit
since assuming office. King Hus-
sein of Jordan, who hosted Wald-
heim in Amman last summer, is
expected to arrive in Vienna
today.

Austria's small, environmen-
talist Green Party called Wald-
heim’s refusal to resign ”a slap in
the face” for the republic.

In today's early editions, the
Kurier tabloid of Vienna said ”the
coalition [government] missed
breaking by a hair on account of
Wa|dheim.”

Waldheim, 69, has maintained
he is innocent of any
wrongdoing.

George Gatewood, profes-

disclosed Waldheim’s wartime
past in March 1986, during his
successful presidential campaign.
The reports included allegations
that Waldheim helped deport
Jews to Nazi death camps.

Since then, the United States
has barred him from entering the
country and Israel has withdrawn
its ambassador to Vienna.

A 202-page report released
Tuesday by a six-member panel
of historians documented Wald-
heim’s actions as a German army
lieutenant from 1942 to 1945.

The report concluded Wald-
heim had been in ”close proximi-
ty” to criminal actions and said
the question of whether he is
guilty of any crime remains open.
It also documented Waldheim’s
intimate knowledge of Nazi

atrocities in the Balkans, where
he served during a brutal cam-
paign in World War II.

Panel member Yehuda Wal-
lach of Israel decried newspaper
headlines which said the report
had exonerated Waldheim.

”That simply isn't in our
report,” Wallach told a news
conference. ”That stands in stark-
est contrast to our findings.”

Wallach did not name any
newspapers, but such claims
were on the front pages of many
Austrian dailies on Tuesday, in-
cluding the nation's largest tab-
loid, Neue Kronen Zeitung.

The newspaper, a Waldheim
supporter, said in a front-page
headline: ”Historians Found No
Personal Guilt on Wa|dheim’s
Part." It underlined in red the
word ”no.”

IN F treaty

By Mark R. Brown
Staff Writer

Professor Habib Zikria, chair-
man of the Afghan Humanitarian
Support Committee, was in Pitts-
burgh lobbying for support of
something on the minds of the
Afghanis — the ratification by the
U.S. Senate of the Intermediate
Nuclear Forces treaty. The Afgha-
nis want ratification to be contin-
gent upon the total withdrawal of
Soviet armed forces from Af-
ghanistan.

”The May 15 troop pullout as
announced by Gorbachev is
propaganda. It is designed to in-
fluence the U.S. Senate to ratify
the INF treaty before Soviets
leave Afghanistan," said Zikria,
.who was an assistant professor in
Kabul, the Afghanistan capital,
prior to the 1979 Soviet invasion.

Zikria said that glasnost has, so
far, only amounted to ”pretty
words.” He believes the ratifica-
tion of the treaty would tip the
scales too far in favor of the
Soviets, saying that U.S. cruise
missiles are our most effective
weapons since they cannot be
detected. He said this would pre-
vent the Soviet Union from in-
stituting a nuclear war.

He explained, ”This takes their
game of nuclear blackmail out of
their hands. It would take a Soviet
intercontinental missile 45 to 60
minutes to strike the United
States. Their missiles can be de-
tected in six minutes, and Ameri-
can Cruise and Pershing missiles
could then be launched against
targets in the Soviet Union,

Abortion bill meets opposition

By Rod Lynder

Associated Press Writer

HARRISBURG —— Laws requir-
ing minors to get parental consent
for abortions aren't effective and
place a heavy burden on preg-
nant teenagers, according to law-
yers testifying Wednesday about
a Massachusetts law similar to
one being considered here.

An attorney for a lawyers’ refer-
ral group in Massachusetts said
the provision has caused ”in-
numerable problems” in that
state.

The committee hearing was
held to gather testimony on a
parental consent requirement ex-
pected to be included in new

abortion-control legislation being
drafted in Pennsylvania. The pro-
visions generally require a female
who is a minor to get parental
consent, or a court order, before
she would be allowed to get an
abortion.

Teenagers who feel they can't
talk about the pregnancy with
their parents can have a hearing
before a judge to determine if
they are competent to make,a de-
cision about an abortion, under
the law.

"Sabino and another lawyer for
the group said many young wom-
en are harassed by their parents
or forced into marriages because
of the pregnancy.

Two students, Jessica Rogal of

Pennsbury High School in Bucks.
County and Cara Page, a senior
at George School and a resident
of Bristol, said it isn't realistic to
expect the law would cause more
teenagers to talk with their
parents.

”What makes you think a dis-
cussion about pregnancy will oc-
cur if the parents have not been
mature enough themselves to dis-
cuss their daughters’ concerns
about sex before she became
pregnant?” asked Page.

Rogal told the committee she
believes lawmakers proposing
the parental-‘consent provision
only want to limit abortions, not
help minors with an extremely
difficult decision.

Couple sues for return of foster child from family ‘

PHILADELPHIA — A black
couple has decided to appeal a
decision to return their 4-year-old
foster son to his previous foster
parents, who are white, their at-
torney saicl Wednesday.

The previous foster parents,
John and Marylyn Mcl.aughlin,
charged in a December 1986
civil rights suit that Raymond Bul-
lard, who is black, was taken
away from them in October 1985
only for racial reasons.

The city, hoping to resolve the
case quickly, agreed to return the
child to the McLaughlins but the
new foster parents, Willie and
Elaine Williams, challenge the
move.

A state hearing officer upheld
the decision to return Raymond
to the McLaughIins. Wednesday
was the deadline for the second
family to appeal that ruling to
Commonwealth Court.

Williams said he, his wife and
their three adopted teenagers
”agonized over it. They all decid-
ed they wanted to keep Ray-
mond, no matter what it cost."

The teenagers offered to spend

their allowances to help keep
Raymond, Williams said.

Freak accident; baby
slides through pipe

WORTHINCTON, Pa. — A
1 5-month-old boy battled for his
life after being flung from his par-
ents’ car in an accident, washed
though a drainage pipe and
retrieved frc)m a pool of cold
water Wednesday.

Eric McCourt was in critical
condition in Children's Hospital
of Pittsburgh, said hospital
spokeswoman Sue Cardillo, who
withheld further details. Police
said he suffered head injuries and
a lowered body temperature.
Witnesses said Eric was not
breathing when he was pulled
from the water.

State police said the child was
riding unsecured in the lap of his
father, Donald McCourt, 22, of
Kittanning, when his mother,
Penni Lee Cutherie, 19, also of
Kittanning, lost control of their
car on a snow-covered road.

State law requires that children

under four years of age or weigh-
ing less than 40 pounds ride in

child safety seats.

The car overturned and Iancled
on its passenger side suspended
over a creek, ejecting the child
through the passenger-side win-
dow. The child apparently land-
ed in the water and floated
through a drainage pipe under
the road, authorities said.

Train wreck hearing

delayed until Monday

PHILADELPHIA — A hearing
into why Amtrak switchman Tho-
mas Connor left the scene of an
Amtrak derailment he admitted
causing Jan. 29 in Chester has
been postponed, a spokesman
said Tuesday.

Connor has admitted to inad-
vertently switching a passenger
train on a collision course with a
maintenance vehicle, resulting in

a crash that injured 25 passengers
and caused $3 million in
damage.

Connor, who is a member of
the Transportation Communica-
tion Workers Union, faces possi-
l)le dismissal. He is charged with
leaving his post without waiting
to be relieved and failing to take
mandatory drug and alcohol tests
within eight hours of the ac-
cident.

FDA approves new contact lens Afghan

By Kim Nowicki
For The Pitt News

The Food and Drug Adminis-
tration recently approved a con-
tact lens made of a unique
material that gives lenses a non-
stick surface and allows for bet-
ter vision.

The Boston Equalens, made
with fluorine, is an extended-
wear, hard contact lens that can
be worn daily or up to seven
days.

The Boston Equalens was deve-
loped in Wilmington, Mass., by
Polymer Technology Corpora-
tion, a subsidiary of Bausch &
Lomb.

According to Dr. Ronald Her-
skowitz, vice president of labora-
tory and technical affairs for
Polymer Technology Corpora-
tion, the fluorine added in the
polymer mixture enables the lens
to be more oxygen permeable.

”The cornea is one of the only
tissues in the body to receive oxy-
gen from the environment, so the
more oxygen-permeable the lens,
the healthier it is for the eye,”
said Dr. Herskowitz.

”The fluorine contained in the
lens resists protein deposits that
may cause discomfort to the
wearer,” Herskowitz added.

The advantages of the new lens
include sharper vision, easy care
and greater lens durability.

”Soft-lens, extended-wear con-
tacts need to be replaced every
12 to 18 months, but the Boston
Equalens only needs [to be]
replaced every 2 to 4 years,”
claimed Dr. Herskowitz.

The Boston Equalens has been
on the international market since
January of 1986. ”The response
to this new product has been very
good,” said Dr. Herskowitz.

Aire-Con Labs in downtown
Pittsburgh makes about 140

lenses a day and serves over
1,000 physicians in the tri-state
area.

According to Colleen Frazier,
lab manager at Aire-Con, ”The
Equalens has been on the market
only two months, and up to one-
third of the work we do is now
for the Equa|ens."

Dawn Parrish, Boston Equalens
wearer and consultant at Aire-
Con Lab, commented, ’’Before I
started wearing the Equalens, l al-
ways had to wear sunglasses on
bright days, but now the UV-
absorber [ultra-violet absorber] in
the lens protects my eyes from
the sun.”

The ultra-violet absorber is
what protects the eyes from ultra-
violet light. The FDA cautions
that this is not a substitute for pro-
tective eye wear that is made spe-
cifically for protecting the eye
against the ultra violet light.

Council requests own

By Jonathan Berr
Staff Writer

Members of the Pittsburgh
City Council are planning a
meeting with the mayor to re-
quest funds for their own legal
counsel.

There is unanimous agree-
ment among City Council
members that legal counsel is
needed.

Mayor Richard Caliguiri ve-
toed the bill on budgetary

grounds.

Councilman James Ferlo
called the mayor’s veto ”ludi-
crous and laughab|e.”

Ferlo said, ”The veto has
nothing to do with city
finances. The mayor does not
want the council to be in-
dependent.”

Councilman Jack Wagner
said the Pittsburgh City Coun-
cil is the only one in Alleghe-
ny County that doesn’t have its
own lawyer on its staff.

The Home Rule Charter of
the City of Pittsburgh allows

counsel

Council to hire their own le-
gal counsel.

Wagner said a lawyer is
needed in order to ”profes-
siona|ize” the actions and
procedures of City Council.

”We would save the taxpay-
ers a lot of dollars and time if
we had our own legal coun-
sel,” said Councilwoman
Michelle Madoff.

Many observers said the
mayor's veto would have been
overridden if Councilman Ben
Woods had attended the
meeting.

submarines, would strike in
another six minutes. That makes
a successful Soviet first-strike im-
possible.

”Why are the Soviets so eager

to lose 1,500 missiles targeted to.

Europe in exchange for the loss
of 450 U.S. missiles, especially if
they view Reagan as a hated ene-
my? Clearly, this would then give
the Soviets a conventional advan-
tage in Europe. The Pershing and
Cruise missiles are like a loaded
gun pointed at the head of the
Soviets,” said Zikria.

Zakria feels that nuclear
weapons are indicative of a lack
of trust, as evidenced by Soviet
expansionism in his country. He
said that the United States must
gain something to balance the
power if the treaty is to be rati-

fied. He asked, ”Does the Unit-
ed States wish to give up their
leverage? What do they want in
return?  Peace cannot only be
realized just by disarmament; the
Soviets must give up their expan-
sionism.

”SALT II was never ratified be-
cause of the Soviet invasion and
occupation of my country. After
eight years, between 1.2 and 1.5
million Afghanis have been killed
by the Soviets and their puppets
—- People's Democratic Army of
Afghanistan, Indian and Viet-
namese troops - and over five
million Afghanis have had to flee
Afghanistan for their lives. That is
the largest, forced mass exodus in
history. The Soviets must diveﬁt
[from] Afghanistan, they must
perform a pullout,” . he em-
phasized.

able to combine data for ana-
lytical technique.

”MAP would determine the
positions of stars and accom-
panying bodies. It measures its
intrinsic value by measuring
luminosity [how much energy
it generates], mass and dis-
tance between stars,” said
Gatewood.

”A star is the only working
thermonuclear reactor that can
be observed. To study the
process, we must understand
all that we can.

”We know how two bodies
react to each other in space.
And we know that energy falls
away on the square of the dis-
tance. That is, three times as
far away equals one-ninth as
much energy seen,” said
Gatewood.

Gatewood received his
master's and Ph.D. from the
University of Pittsburgh and
has been a professor here
since 1972. He is currently the
administrator of of Pitt's Al-
legheny Observatory.

this February 14, the birds may
hold off until a heat wave arrives.

Freezing weather or not, Febru-
ary l4 still remains Valentine's
Day, and lovers will be celebrat-
ing the occasion —— or so it's al-
ways been in the past.

When asked about tentative
Valentine's Day plans, students
gave responses bordering on the
lethargic.

’’I’m working three to eleven so
it's kind of hard to do anything,”
said one female student who re-
fused to give her name.

”Nothing. I'm doing nothing. I
couldn't even tell you when it
is,” said a student who refused to
give his name once he realized
his blunder.

”l’|l probably do nothing. Go-
ing to school I guess.” Upon be-
ing informed that Valentine’s Day
is this Sunday, the student added,
’’Then, I'll be sleeping.”

’’I’m not sure yet,” responded
one woman. ”l’ll probably end
up seeing my boyfriend. He's a
doctor, by the way." Thanks.

”ls it this weekend?" ques-
tioned another student. He and a
friend began figuring out upon
which day it fell with the help of
their fingers.

”Sunday. Oh, yeah. The Lakers
and Celtics are on this Sunday at
3:30,” replied the friend with the
quicker fingers. ”|’|l be rooting
for the Celtics.”

Just as all seemed lost, Joe Smi-
go, a senior English writing
major, offered an indication of
respect for this centuries-old
hohday.

’’I’m making dinner for my girl—
friend," he said. He also said he
didn't buy her a gift but added,
’’I’m enough.”

Bats, Bbronk, the Whereabouts,
Radio Hanoi, Carsickness,
Graceland, Da Shunts, L.A.B.

All these bands contained
(some still contain) a member or
two of the Crow Flies. Collective-
ly, they have an enormous
amount of experience at this
thing we call rock ‘n’ roll. Besides
that, their drummer wants to mar-
ry Edye Tarbox.

PP: So, do you all worship
Satan?

Mark Miller: Used to. When
we were in Bbronk, we had to.

Matt Marcus: Yeah, but he
turned into a big asshole.

Sam Matthews: He has pretty
bad lyrics.

Matt: He kept calling me up for
a long time to try to get me to go
have a beer with him. I just told
him to go away.

Evan Knauer: You shouldn't
joke around about the devil.

Sam: Well, look where it's got-
ten Motley Crue!

Matt: You're right, Wheels
[Evan]. It's not funny and even
more, it's not safe.

Mark: Yes, it's clear that this Sa-
tan worship leads to murder and
mescaline.

Sam: Motley Crue thought it
was a joke, and now one of them
is stuck married to Heather
Locklear.

PP: So, how did you gentlemen
finally decide upon this arrange-
ment of musicians known as the

Here’s to the industry that con-
sistently maintains high stan-
dards, super quality and low
prices. We’re proud to honor our

Crow Flies?

Mark: Matt and Evan were the
original Crow Flies, then Sam and
I joined them.

Matt: Evan thought up that
name when A.T.S. was going to
change their name at one point.

Evan: [Also guitar player for
A.T.S.] Steve Heineman [A.T.S.
drummer] wanted to call us Black
Coffee. And to neutralize the
acid, I thought of a better name:
the Crow Flies.

Sam: Someone claims there's
an actual bird called a crow fly.

Matt: Anyway, that was about
the time Da Shunts stopped play-
ing [both M_att and ‘Evan were
Shunts], so Evan and I were try-
ing to get together a new band
somehow.

Evan: We also have this thing

E

 

  

\n

called the Ferral Family we all
play in.

Mark: The Ferrals have been
pretty dormant.

Sam: The cool thing about the
Ferrals is the stand-up aluminum
bass.

Matt: We've been dormant?

Sam: As the Ferrals, we've
played at the Penn Cafe, on the
street in front of Chief's. That got
us into Thirsty’s.

Matt: There we were, out on
the street, and this guy comes out
and says, ”Hey, why don't you
play in Thirsty’s?” So we did. To
this drunk guy.

Sam: I still think the Ferrals
should play on Walnut Street. It’s
pretty cold out there.

Sam: Not right now!

PP: So, I hear you have some
new recordings to offer the pub-

lic 

Sam: We're in the studio.

Matt: You're in the studio. [It's
a home recording.]

PP: What do you think your
stuff sounds like? What sorts of
things influenced you while you
were writing and playing those
songs?

Matt: Well, I mostly write
while I'm driving around in a van
all day. I keep a piece of paper
in my lap and write when I stop
at intersections.

Mark: My method is about as
systematic as people who can
only write while they're in the
bathtub. Just about every song
I've handed this band I've written
during a Sunday morning
hangover

Evan: What? You're kidding?

Gene Loves Jezebel should flesh out their performance

By Joan Kane '
Staff Writer

If I had to describe last Friday night's Gene Loves Jezebel
concert in two words, ”visually stimulating” might do it.

Frontmen Michael and Jay Aston certainly know how to
perform before a teenaged crowd. The twin brothers pout—
ed, pranced and slithered across the stage and along the
raised u—shaped ramp.

Not only did they tease the audience with their sugges-
tive movements, but to enhance the effect, they dressed the
part. Their outfits consisted of shiny lame, glittering scarves,
silk shirts in dazzling colors and wel|—painted faces.

There was little more to this show than the glamour, flash-
ing lights and colorful backdrops, though. Unfortunately, the
music was second to the fashion.

The exception was the spirited ”Motion Of Love,” which
brought the crowd into a dancing frenzy, and the slower,
more melodic ”Every Door” that featured a sizzling guitar
solo by guitarist James Stevenson; everything else was in-
distiguishable and dismissable.

The Astons, Stevenson, drummer Chris Bell and bassist
Peter Rizzo are all more than competent musicians, but they
relied too heavily on their set formula. lnsteading of sound-
ing as unique as they looked, they came off at times like pret-
ty boys playing heavy metal fluff.

The audience didn't seem to object, though. For the most
part, they boun(‘ed or swayed to the beat. Girls screamed
and tossed jewelry, lingerie and flowers onto the stage. it
was obvious that they had come to dance and pay homage
to the band. Even problems with the speakers during part
of the performance didn't dampen the crowd's spirit or ruin
their fun.

Unlike Gene Loves Jezebel, the opening act didn't have

any of the colorful trappings that the headliners did. Instead, , J‘°'“”° H“”'e’/The Pl" News
Flesh For Lulu came out and played hard, tight rock ’n’ roll    .
with a danceable beat and no gimmicks. .
Lead Singer Nick Marsh was a Volatile bumue of energy. Flesh for Lulu and Gene Loves Jezebel played to masses of screaming teens (and others)

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, February ll, I988

For The Pitt News

It starts with a bang, drum beats
and the pounding of a typewriter.
An ominous voice pronounces
the words ”Principia Scriptoriae"
while at the same time they ap-
pear on the screen forming the
backdrop to the stage.

City Theatre's production or
Principia Scriptoriae, directed by
Marc Masterson, opened Wed-
nesday, Feb. 3. The bold opening
of the show (house lights that go
black instead of fading and ag-
gressive sound cues) set high ex-
pectations of the production.

It is the story of two writers in
an unspecified Latin American
country trying to come to terms
with their roles as writers under
political oppression.

The slats composing the back-
round screen become prison
bars, forming the setting for Act
I, which takes place in a jail. The
ugly, naive U.S. citizen, Bill (Paul
Anderson) and Ernesto Uulio
Ochoa), the more patient Latin
American, are political prisoners.

The technical aspects of the
production outshone the dramat-
ic action. The lighting oftentimes
captured the mood of the scene
—— sometimes soft and dim and
other times shifting to come from
behind the screen, creating stark
shadows as the prisoners are tor-
tured and kept in fear for their
lives.

Finding principles as a writer

I By Frank Shankley Jr.

The most touching moments in
this act come when Bill turns to
recite the English poem The
Seafarer to comfort himself from
the frightening reality he faces.
And again at the end of the act,
when Ernesto insists that he will
not write about this horrific ex-
perience but rather about grow-
ing up. -

The most involving moment
comes when Ernesto is talking in
Spanish to the wounded prisoner
played by Ben Tatar. It goes on
long enough to make the au-
dience feel Bill's alienation; the
audience is in Bill's position, not
understanding the interaction be-
tween the Latin American
natives.

Some of the contrasts set up in
this act are not as strong as they
could be. The contrast between
the dry wit of the titles on the
screen and the horror of the fear
and the pain of torture that the
characters undergo is present, but
the production doesn't reach the
emotional depth to make them
clear. The cultural contrast be-
tween United States-style Ameri-
can and Latin American-style
American could also have been
exploited and made more
distinct.

The most engaging scene of the
second act comes early: it is the
scene of the power struggle be-
tween the Latin government, led
by its Minister of Culture (Gene
Kail) and a writers’ committee,

The band's obvious enthusiasm

led by Hans Einhorn (Bob

number of people on stage, there
seems to be more action in this
scene than any of the others.
Also, in this scene it is clear who
is on whose side and who is
manipulating whom is un-
mistakable.

Principia Scriptoriae is an in-
teresting play. It is funny and
touching in places, though this
could have been more consistent
through the play; in places what
was going on was not clear
enough to make the humor and
pain work in play.

Manon continues the story of lean

03y Michele Kiraly

Staff Writer

Water runs abundantly in Man-
on of the Spring, the second and
tragic part of the French block-
buster film /ean de Florette,
which was shown in Pittsburgh
last December.

Whether from a natural spring,
the village fountain, an under-
ground stream or even a vi||ager’s

Qears, water lS El constant presence

in this beautiful epic directed by
Claude Berri, who adapted both
works to the screen.

Emmanualle Beart plays the ti-
tle role of Manon, a wild young
shepherdess who tends her goats,
sets traps for birds and climbs
among the rocky cliffs of the
French Provencal region.

Yves Montand and Daniel Au-
teuil play uncle and nephew in
both films and star as the mem-
bers of the once powerful and

Qwealthy Soubeyrans.

Manon won't leave this pastor-
al paradise to join her mother in
the city. We learn that Manon is
not just a naturalist — she wants
to seek revenge on the two
townsmen who indirectly caused
her father's death.

Based on French playwright
and author Marcel Pagnol’s two
volume epic, L’eau des Collines
[The Water of the Hills], the first
story in the book is /ean de
Florette. It's the tale of the
Soubeyan family's scheme to
gain the farm owned by Jean de
Florette, Manon’s father.

Their plan succeeds: Jean
doesn't discover the source of the

spring and joyfully discuss their
plans, as the horrified, young

Manon looks on, hidden to them
from behind a bush.

Manon of the Spring begins 10
years after this last scene. Auteuil
stars as Ugolin, an awkward and
homely farmer who becomes fas-
cinated with Manon when, out
hunting one day, he sees her
tending her flock. Soon, he falls
in love with her and reminds her
that he was once friends with her
father Jean. '

When Ugolin confronts Man-
on, she firmly rejects his love and
accuses him of plugging up the
water source, causing her late
father's ruin. Manon marries a
young school teacher in the vil-
lage; Ugolin is devastated.

Old Soubeyran is upset, realiz-
ing that since Ugolin will remain
a bachelor, there will be no one
to carry on the family name.

In a strange twist of fate, he
learns of a letter he never
received while in the army in
Africa, a letter sent by his only
love, who is the mother of Jean
de Florette.

Montand gives a fine perfor-

mance as old Soubeyran. His act-

ing is genuine and very moving.

We feel his devastation in learn-

ing about the lost letter.

Berri opens the film in an in-
teresting way, which we later

realize is a prelude. The first
scene shows a carpenter nailing
a cross to a coffin, Ugolin’s red
Carnations in full bloom and
water from channels reaching the
flowers.

The village is without water for
a while and we learn Manon is
to blame, hence earning her

Swan Lake — in
time for romance

By Cathleen Karlsson
Staff Writer

With Valentine's day coming
up on Sunday and a touch of
romance in the air, it seems im-
possible to ignore tales of the star-
crossed lovers depicted by so
many classic romances. This is
especially true due to the upcom-
ing performances of Pittsburgh
Ballet Theatre's rendition of Swan
Lake at Benedum Center from
February 11th-14th.

Swan Lake, originally
choreographed by Marius Petipa,
traces the smitten Prince Sieg-
fried’s true love for the beautiful
Odette. Princess Odette has been
maliciously put under the evil
spell of Baron vonRothbart, and
is destined to continue her life as
a white swan until the love of a
prince can save her.

Meanwhile, von Rothbart's
daughter Odile —— the black
swan-uses her alluring ways to

deceive Odette, keeping Prince
Siegfried entranced by her evil
"love."

The ballet expresses the con-
trast of good against evil, and es-
sentially love versus lust -
showing how easily one can be
betrayed by mistaken identity.

The lead, dual role of Odette
and Odile is a demanding one re-
quiring not only stamina and skill
of the ballerina, but also an un-
derstanding and ability to
separate the two opposite charac-
ter's roles without neglecting the
similarities they share.

Michelle Lucci, a guest per-
former with Pittsburgh Ballet
Theatre, will alternate dancing
the role of Odette with Janet
Popeleski the PBT principal who
portrayed "Daisy" in the compa-
ny's season premiere perfor-
mance of The Great Gatsby.

As romances go, Swan Lake's
classic tale should be a treat for
all to enjoy over this Valentine's
weekend.

Crow

Continued from page 7
Mark: Bleariness is the key.
Sam: Something has to really

motivate me. Last time, it was
Edye Tarbox. Hey, she was the
guest DJ on WDVE this morning.
She played Led Zep.

Mark: I wanna marry her.

PP: Excuse me. The new
recordings?

Mark: Well, we've been play-
ing it live for so long, it's really
hard to distance yourself from it
to describe it.

Matt: I guess it's pretty metallic.

Sam: The Crow Flies are a band
I would go see.

Matt: You have to. You're in it.

Sam: You know what I mean.
There aren't many bands I'd go

see on a regular basis. The Crow
Flies is one. Even if I wasn't in it.
The Flies really rock!

Mark: Our stuff doesn't sound
like any specific thing besides
what we like. We figure if we like
it enough, someone else is bound
to. I mean, there have to be peo-
ple out there as twisted as we are.
Somewhere.

Sam: When I was in 96 Tears,
I didn't particularly like the au-
dience. I really like the Crow
Flies’ audience. They're cool
people.

Matt: They are cool. We love
them.

Sam: We don't love them 

Matt: Sure we do. Why don't
any of them love me?

Mark: We're gonna finish this
project and put out another cas-
sette. Maybe more.

Sam: We're now Rat on a Stick

PP: Suppose, after all this, peo-
ple still don’t have a complete
idea of what you are about. What
could you say to inspire folks to
come and see you?

All: Hmmmmm 

PP: How about, "We’re really
cute"?

Matt: No, we're not.

Mark: I'm the only cute one.
Well, just a little bit.

Matt: OK. We're gonna be
loud. We're gonna play with a lot
of balls. We probably won't stand
still. We're pretty good, too.

Serpent lacks any real venom

By Gina Landi

Staff Writer

The Serpent and the Rainbow
is an adequate film despite the
liberties it takes with Wade Da-
vis’ compelling anthro—adventure
book of the same name. Direct-
ed by Wes Craven, the story takes
the form of gory, yet slick horror.

Perhaps it already sounds like
I am going to mourn the dis-
crepancies between book and
film. I do; Davis’ treatment of his
experience was a scientif-
ic/spiritual/detective quest. In the
hands of a director like John
Boorman or Ken Russell, Serpent
could have been a real head-film
— all the more scary with ingre-
dients like intelligence and great
archetypal contrasts. Well, who
cares anyway? After all, the
movie was merely ”inspired by
the book by Wade Davis,” as it
said on my crimson and white
pass to this free midnight horror-
show in Monroeville.

I think summarizing the film
right off is necessary — un-
familiarity abounds. First of all,
we see the anthropologist, Denis
Alan (played by Bill Pullman), in
the Amazon rainforest collecting

medicinal plant specimens. Later,
he drinks a steaming herbal
beverage offered to him by a sha-
man? old Indian sage? and
promptly hallucinates that he's
being chased through the forest
by a jaguar. Pretty neat stuff —
narrating in retrospect, Alan con-
cludes the animal was a kind of
sign of danger to come. When he
gets back to the States, the head
of a drug corporation asks him to
go to Haiti to procure a sample
of something he claims will
revolutionize anesthetics. The
substance is the dreaded "zom-
bie poison" used to put voodoo
victims under, so to speak — so
out of it that they appear dead
and are buried alive. They are
dug up a couple weeks later,
drugged, beaten and set loose. Of
course, everyone is scared of
these "dead" people, and the
zombies themselves lose all hu-
man spirit. Hence, the roving
dead are a potent agent of social
control. Alan goes to Haiti and
contacts a beautiful young doctor
(Cathy Tyson) who runs a clinic
and treats the local walking dead.

The rest of the film revolves
around Alan and his love interest
in a female psychiatrist played by

Cathy Tyson, zombie—hunting as
well as zombie poison—hunting
and run-ins with the bokor (Zakes
Mokae), who uses voodoo for
evil ends. There are all kinds of
weird things that happen to
Alann. He has horrifying visions
and is tortured by the bokor, who
is also the head of the Ton Ton
Macoute, Haiti's repressive secret
police organization. They do not
want Alan to get hold of the poi-
son, their best weapon against the
people. The scene involving the
police's self-willed torture chair is
a welcome bit of parody. As is the
ritzy dinner party upon Alan's
first trip back to the United States,
where he finds that he cannot
leave evil behind in Haiti.

The most engaging things
about the film are depictions of
voodoo ceremonies and Haitian
street scenes. The ritualistic ac-
tivities —— dancing, bathing in the
sacred springs —— were truly fas-
cinating.

In terms of character develop-
ment and screenplay, the cast did
a good job with what they had to
work with — a mess. Especially
Zakes Mokae. Effects were excel-
lent, but I didn't even care. They
do little to scare me. Slickness un-
dermines horror as far as I'm con-
cerned. I prefer a suspenseful,
savage, gritty Craven film to this
kind of outing — namely The Last
House on the Left. Although The
Serpent and the Rainbow is in the
supernatural, not "spatter" realm,
as this early film is, it still com-
pares unfavorably simply by do-
ing a bad job of being a
supernatural film. Ultimately, this
Craven effort would be better if
it employed the imagination and
economy of his earlier work.

Waiting for the
SGB to Go—do——(i)t

To anyone bored with the networks’ offerings of entertaining mys-
tery shows, we would like to offer a suggestion. Venture to the sixth
floor of the William Pitt Union on a Monday afternoon and witness
your elected officials of the Student Government Board in action.

These meetings are held, presumably, for the Board members to
inform one another and the student body of their alleged activities
during the week. Unfortunately, anyone wishing to become truly in-
formed must utilize their detective skills.

Board member Kent Baldauf apparently considers the following
statement to be informative: ”A new system of Contact and informa-
tion exchange between the SGB and [the University Senate] represen-
tatives has been developed. This system is to be implemented in the
coming weeks." Baldauf may have a career in writing suspense nov-
els. One is nearly killed by curiosity before the meeting ends and
can inquire, ”what system? Can you please give us a little hint as
to what this new system may entail?”

What Baldauf was trying to say, in his own endearingly vague and
verbose way, is that student representatives to the University Senate
will now be required to file reports with the SGB.

The element of suspense is not confined to the Board members’
reports. Chris Cooper, chairperson of the Governmental Relations
Committee, piqued our curiosity with the following: "There have been
some amendments to House Bill 1,900, and they will be forwarded
to the committee for discussion.” No one seemed to know what
House Bill 1,900 is, much less what the amendments are, but appar-
ently the Board members are not cursed with an inquisitive nature,
as no one paused to ask.

However, someone who did ask discovered that House Bill 1,900
deals with crime on the college campus. The amendments in ques-
tion refer to a college's responsibility to report the number of crimes
per year.

Far and away the grand mistress of suspense on the SGB is Pamela
Rich. Rich has perfected the art of revealing just enough of her ac-
tivities to hold our interest yet keep us substantially in the dark for
months, almost a year in some cases.

At the beginning of Rich's previous term, in January of 1987, she
undertook the task of placing four suggestion boxes around campus.
A generous estimate of the time this might take is about two weeks.
On Jan. 15, Rich reported she had acquired four boxes and estab-
lished four locations. By Jan. 22, she had had one of the boxes fitted
for a lock. Nearly a month went by before she revealed that the other
three boxes had been fitted with locks, and all four of the boxes had
been varnished.

On Feb. 26, Rich reported that she had received administrative ap-
proval to set up the boxes, but two of the locations would have to
be changed. At long last, on March 5 (just as everyone was about
to burst with the question, ’’will we ever see those suggestion box-
es?”) Rich was, and here we quote from the minutes, "happy to an-
nounce that the suggestion boxes are finally placed in [their]
locations.”

However, Rich's coup de grace is the suspense generated by the
book-exchange project she took on 11 months ago. On March 12,
1987, Rich reported (again, we quote from the minutes) that she
would ”begin working on a student book exchange, where instead
of the students putting up individual flyers to sell books, they would
all be compiled together on a computer.”

At the last meeting of the term, a month later, Rich was ”looking
for someone to run the computer.” By November, Rich had us in
such suspense that she managed to get re—elected by promising to
do what she had failed to do in her previous term.

Eleven months after the book-exchange project was begun, its sta-
tus now is that by April 1, CAS students might be able to register
for the fall on the College of General Studies’ exchange system.

Soap operas have been making a fortune from these kinds of esca-
pades for years. Perhaps if we renamed the SGB ”The Young and
the Hopeless” or ”As the University Turns,” it might just develop
a cult following. ,

Israeli situation not funny

I have a question. I was hoping I

you might be able to help me
with it. I was wondering if I was
supposed to be amused with the
cartoons Todd Condron has
produced dealing with the situa-
tion in Israel (Jan. 7 and Feb 1)?
Am I to understand from these
cartoons that the Israeli govern-
ment has every right to oppress
Palestinians? Am I to understand
that the Israeli government has
every right not only to gun down
Palestinian protestors, but to
break their bones and torture
them as well?

I am sorry but I do not find hu-
mor in a cartoon that pokes fun
at the loss of human life and free-
dom. The Palestinians have a
legitimate struggle; one that does
not deserve to be cartooned but
realized, one that should not be
brushed off as inconsequential
but supported. Don't the Palestin-
ians have every right to protest
the situation they are in; after all,
isn't that an inalienable right?

What is happening in Israel is
the historic example of oppressed
versus oppressor, which is being
seen in South Africa, Central
America and throughout the
world. I am sorry but I can't en-
joy a newspaper that prides itself
on racist and inaccurate report-
ing; there's already plenty of
those kind in this country. -

Who's the Loudmouth?

I'll admit that I don't go to the
Hillman Library all that much. I
am a commuter, and as such
study at home most of the time.
When I do go to the library,
however, I quite reasonably ex-
pect it to be a relatively quiet
place. This is why I was so dis-
turbed on Tuesday on the thrid
floor when I had to listen to the
Loudmouth.

I refer to him as such since I
don't know his name. First off, he
is not a student — he is a faculty
member, about forty-ish with
graying hair. I learned that the
Loudmouth is taking a trip with
his wife to Ireland and has recent-
ly become a drama critic for the
Post-Gazette. I did not ask this‘, I

I

LEITERS

overheard it. Loudly. From about

30 feet away. I could have slept
just as well and concentrated on
my work much better if the gen-
tleman in question would have
refrained from speaking volumes
at such high volume.

I don't wish to name names,
even if I could, or to embarrass
anyone (especially since the gen-
tleman did quite a thorough job
of that on his own). I only wish
to let him know, if he's reading
this, that I found his behavior
rude and substandard for being in
a library.

I will also say that it is the only
time I have heard a disturbance
like this, from faculty or student.
All I would ask is for some com-
mon consideration in the future.

Why are we here?

Although I hadn't been too in-
terested in the Panthers’ football
this season, a story caught my at-
tention. We have all heard about
Craig Heyward’s decision to go
pro from the media's bombard-
ment of the situation. But in all
the panic about losing our Heis-
man hope, has anybody touched
the profound implications of this
"common procedure?”

I'm not normally one to com-
plain, but when college athletes

In a nutshell 

”pack their books," as Thomas
Danyluk put it, to go to the pros,
a serious question must be asked:
Are our scholastic sports become-
ing more important than the col-
leges we go to?

First of all, why do most of us
go to college -—— lots of answers,
I would imagine. But what was
the college started for — a system
of higher education for those who
wanted it. When an institution,
like the University of Pittsburgh
becomes a facade for some col-
lege athletes to get noticed by the
pro scouts, we must seriously
scrutinize our athletic system
much more closely than we have
been.

Should college athletes have to
fulfill their college aducation in
order for them to be considered
professionals, or will we let our
university continue to be a boot-
camp for professional sports?
Once the athletes get the atten-
tion they need, they forego their
education to this essentially un-
needed step in their hierarchy. I
do congratulate head coach Mike
Gottfried on his attempt to try and
persuade Heyward of the conse-
quences of his decision, and that
he should finish his education -
supposedly the reason we are all
here for.

As Gottfreid said, he must "...
sit down and grasp the whole sit-
uation.” We must sit down and
grasp the fundamentals and
ethics on which we base our
educational system.

Just a letter to dear

I received a letter from my
mother last week. Nothing of
earth-shattering importance. Just
a letter from mom. She writes to
me about once a week. Unfor-
tunately, I've never written back
to her. But I do call her about
once a week.

When I received her latest let-
ter, I was among some people I
knew, so I opened it and read it
aloud. She always tells me what's
going on in Dunbar (where I
grew up, nothing special, but a
few good things did come out of
that place), and what she's been
doing. I felt bad because I never
write back, and every time I call
her I tell her I'll try to come to
visit this weekend, but I never do.
In fact, last year I was "home" for
a total of seven days.

So, once again, I was feeling
guilty that I never wrote to my
mother. I called her just last night.
Just to see how she was and ex-
plain to her why I never write,
which is especially ironic be-
cause the thing I want most in life

to be is a successful writer.

Of course, she had to tell me
that she had just sent me a valen-
tine with another letter. I felt
guilty, once again.

I'm not very good at expressing
my feelings at all. In fact, it is
painful for me to be honest with
people I truly care about. For a
woman her age (she's not that old
-— 42 — but it's something I joke
about her with) she's easy to talk
to and very inspiring.

She told me over the phone
that she had just written to me

-about-howiwomen haveitowork

so much harder for what they

  

 

rnncas
SANSIG

want in life.

Knowing that she has always
worked very hard, and from my
own experiences, I had to agree.

I know what I'm about to do
might be cheating just a little bit,
but I promised my mother I was
going to write her a letter. So here
it is. And maybe it will motivate
those of you who haven't written
to good ol’ mom in a while to do
so too:

Dear Mom,

I never thought I'd be relating
to you in such a comfortable way,
because we've not always had
such a good relationship. But
now that I'm 21 and finally mak-
ing my own way through the
world, I'm beginning to see that
all the things you told me were
very valuable pieces of infor-
mation.

I've just moved (and I believe
I sent you my new address), I've
been very busy and I'm very,
very, tired —— like most of the

'ol mom

other students I know. I try not to
fall asleep in class, though. I try.

I've become a much different
person since I was a freshman. I
see things differently, much like
the way you told me they would
be. What you said about men,
you were right. What you told me
about going for what you want,
fighting for it, even if you have to
fail; never sacrifice your princi-
ples, you were right.

I'm always being tested, and

‘the tests are difficult. I've disco-

vered there is much more to col-
lege than scholastic testing. There
is social and moral testing, too.
You'll be glad to know that I've
made a lot of friends since I've
been here. I've also made a lot of
enemies. But life wouldn't be
nearly as interesting if I didn't.
It is true that I have learned
more in the past few years than
my entire life. I've been very
open minded, perhaps too much
so. But it was you who influenced
me to learn about everything I
could and to accept every
challenge I could. You never
know until you try. And so I have
tried, and tried and tried. And
sometimes, I have succeeded.

Anyway, I think I'll be visiting f

you this weekend. You can tell
me more about some of the
things you've been doing, and I'll
try to clean up some of the things
I've been doing.

I love you, I miss you, even if
you are a vegetarian.

Frances.

The following is true; however,
the names have been changed.

"Over Christmas, my parents
were away, and it was just me
and my sister, Alice, in the house.
It was cold, so I decided to build
a fire, and I wanted to involve my
sister.

So, I brought in the wood and
everything, and had everything
ready; all I had to do was bring
Alice in to light it.

So I brought her in, and hand-
ed her a pack of matches and told
her to light one. She wouldn't.

I took a match out of the pack
and put it in her hand, and she
started to cry; then she ran up to
her room and wouldn't come
back down.

She's afraid to light a goddamn
match because three years ago,
she tried to light one, she
dropped it, it burned a little mark
in the rug, my mom yelled at her,
and now she's afraid the same
thing will happen again.

She's I8-years-old, and she
can't even light a match.”

Pete is a 20-year-old Pitt junior,
and on Tuesday, he told me
about the frustration he feels over
his sister's learning disability.

Alice suffered a "delivery room
mishap" when she was born —
through a doctor's error, her brain
was deprived of oxygen, and to-
day, she functions at a fifth-grade
level. The Dawsons are told that,
intellectually and emotionally,

Alice has progressed as far as she
ever will.

The Dawsons are a very close
and loving family. Alice has
never received anything but the
best care, the best instruction,
and most importantly, Aliceis
loved.

But the Dawsons are human.

''It is so damn frustrating," said
Pete. "People pity a mentally
handicapped child when she's
6-months-old, when she's
6-years-old, yeah, people pitied
her. But what about when she's
18?

"Where's the support for us?
Where the hell are the answers?"

In addition to frustration, Pete
carries around guilt.

Alice asks her parents ques-
tions like: "When can I drive a
car?"— when she sees Pete do-
ing the same. Pete tries to involve
her in his activities as much as he
can. For example, Pete and his
girlfriend take her to the movies
a lot. He would like to take her
out socially more often, but how
is a mentally disabled I8-year-old
supposed to deal with, let alone
fit into a beer bash?

When Pete was I0-years-old,
Alice asked him another one of
her "Why can't I do what you
do" questions, and Pete respond-
ed: "Don't you know that you
will never be like us?"

Today he says, ''I will never for-
give myself for saying that."

For a long time, Pete was
almost embarrassed about Alice.
Now he's coming around.

Alice now attends the Maple
Brook School in Amenia, N.Y.
She comes home for breaks on a
regular basis, and comes home
for the summer every year. To
her, it's almost like college and
is the closest thing she will ever
get to it.

She has a job which she got
through the school. She sweeps
floors in a beauty shop.

Alice has a boyfriend. He goes
to school with her, and Pete ﬁnds
relief in the fact that she's ex-
periencing love.

He wonders what goes through
her mind. "Does she know that
she'll never be able to be com-
pletely independent?" "Is she
satisfied with sweeping a floor?"
"Is she frustrated, too?"

Pete may never know those an-
swers, even though he has a life-
time to learn them.

In the event that something
should happen to his parents,
Pete is responsible for Alice's
welfare for the rest of their lives.

"It's like, when I get married,
I'll already have a child."

The care of a mentally disabled
person is a strain on the family.
Some families abandon their dis-
abled members to the state, or to
the streets.

Luckily, most families don't.
Most families approach the situ-
ation with love and understand-
ing, as do the Dawsons.

The frustration they feel is as
real as it is understandable. These
families need to know that they
are not alone. They need support
from each other and from us.

Surrogacy leads  

to broken lives

What are we to make of
the lives left dangling like
participles after the court's
final sentence?

The New lersy Supreme
Court has sensibly conclud-
ed the legal drama of Baby
M. William Stern will retain
custody of the daughter he
calls Melissa. Mary Beth
Whitehead (now) Gould
will regain the title
”mother" to the daughter
she calls Sara. The $10,000
contract that brought about

ELLEN
this toddler's conception is 
void.

Issues of motherhood — one of the " M" words in this case
— were handled carefully by the court. A pregnant woman is
more than a vessel, they ruled. A woman cannot sign away her
maternal rights before birth. Even if Mary Beth Whitehead broke
a promise to give up her child, the court wrote, "we think it
is expecting something well beyond normal human capacities
to suggest that this mother should have parted with her newly
born infant without a struggle." *

Issues of money — another "M" word frequently heard -
were also resolved. ''It is unlikely that surrogacy will survive
without money. We doubt that infertile couples in the low-
income bracket will find upper—income surrogates," the court
wrote. A surrogate mother contract is simply baby-selling and
therefore "illegal, perhaps criminal and potentially degrading
to women."

But there was a third "M" word scrawled all over this case
— "M" for Mess — and I'm afraid that no court ruling, however
well crafted, can reconstruct the lives and futures of the fami-
lies caught up in the swirl of surrogacy. There were more peo-
ple involved than mother, father, child.

Reading the decision, I couldn't help thinking of Elizabeth
Stern, who will now not be allowed to adopt her husband's off-
spring. It was Dr. Stern's health concerns that prompted the

 

search for a surrogate. From now on, she is to be what? —— as .

stepmother, foster mother, custodial mother —- to the toddler-
who just calls her plain mother. What subtle changes can oc-
cur in a relationship when one spouse has a stronger claim to
"their" child than the other?

Elizabeth Stern was court-detennined to be an outsider in this
biological tie. But how much further outside is Richard White-
head? The husband who helped his wife abduct the baby, who
stood by her, is now an ex-husband, with visitation rights to
his own children but not to hers. Indeed, Richard, sterilized long
ago and now divorced, appeared supportive in front of the
cameras at his ex-wife's press conference. It is said he looked
raptly at the woman now visibly pregnant by her new husband.

As for the Whitehead's two children, Ryan, 13, and Tuesday,
12, I cannot imagine how they can come out of this unscathed.
Baby M's life took over their own. These are children who
watched a mother grow pregnant with a half-sister she was to
give away. They saw this mother turn everything upside down
—- including their own lives —— to get back that baby. They have
had to cope with that plus divorce, a new stepfather, another
pregnancy. All in three years.

And then, of course, there is Baby M herself. In criticizing
surrogacy, the court said: "A child, instead of starting off its life
with as much peace and security as possible, finds itself im-
mediately in a tug of war ..." Even this high court cannot resolve
all the tugs to come.

Mary Beth Whitehead-Gould said: ’'I just can't see how four
people loving her, five people loving her, can hurt her." But
Mary Beth is not famous for her far-sightedness. To share this
child, to arrange visits, to put the baby's needs above their own
arguments may not be possible for parents who cannot even
agree if the toddler's name is Sara or Melissa.

The New Jersey Supreme Court applied a break on the
surrogate-motherhood business. With dozens of laws being
presented to state legislatures, with thousands of infertile cou-
ples rifling desperately through a file cabinet of options, this
decision hasn't come a moment too soon. But a more power-
ful message may well come, not from the courthouse, but from
the obvious human muddle, the emotional shambles we've all
witnessed. »

The Baby M legal case is finally over. But the families are
smack dab in the middle of a lifelong Baby M story. The M that
stands for Mess.

Fazio leaving Fighting Irish for Falcons

By Sam Tallarico
Sports Editor

After spending the last two sea-
sons as the University of Notre
Dame's defensive coordinator,
Serafino ”Foge” Fazio has made
another career decision.

Fazio, 48, won't be moving to
another college, but he will be
coaching in a different city. In
fact, he'll even be in a different
league.

The big leagues.

Fazio, who was a head coach
at Pitt for four seasons, resigned
at Notre Dame yesterday to be-
come an assistant coach for the
NFL’s Atlanta Falcons. He will
serve as the special teams and
tight ends coach.

Falcons head coach Marion
Campbell was pleased to have
Fazio join his staff. He knows
what Fazio can do with the play-
ers and hopes he can continue
his success in the NFL.

”He had a good track record at

Pitt and is a good worker with the
kids and good with talent,” said
Campbell.

”We knew that he wanted to
get to [the NFL], so I called [Notre
Dame head coach] Lou Holtz
and Lou gave him a high recom-
mendation.

”|’ve known Foge for a long
time. He was a successful coach
at Pitt and we need people with
that kind of ability,” added
Campbell.

Fazio, who led the Panthers to
two bowls during those four

years, had a 25-18-3 record with
the Panthers before being fired
and replaced by Mike Gottfried.

He served two stints as line-
backer coach at Pitt (1969-72,
1977-81) and was also named as-
sistant head coach and defensive
coordinator from 1979-81. He
was named head coach after
Jackie Sherrill left the school and
became head coach at Texas
A&M.

Fazio’s Job as special teams
and tight ends coach may seem
to be a twist from Fazio’s usual

By Sam Tallarico
sports Editor

After the Pitt-Syracuse game,
Orangemen head coach Jim Boe-
heim seemed upset.

He wasn't upset that his 11th-
ranked team knocked off the fifth-
ranked Panthers in front of the lar-
gest crowd ever to witness a
basketball game in Pittsburgh
(16,798 at the Civic Arena).

Far from it.

What Boeheim did find upset-
ting was the fact that a couple of
Pittsburgh sportswriters wrote in
their columns that this game had
little meaning for the Panthers.

It did mean something for Syra-
cuse, as they turned a five-point
halftime deficit into a 84-75
victory.

”Don’t say that this game
doesn't mean anything to [Syra-
cuse center Rony] Seikaly or [Pitt
center Charles] Smith. It means a
lot to them,” said Boeheim. ”Ev-
ery game is important; you have
to have pride in yourself.”

"They played a very good
game. They outhustled us,” said
Panther coach Paul Evans.

The Panthers record fell to 16-3
overall, 6-2 in the Big East. Syra-
cuse is now 18-5, 7-3 in the
league.

After a sluggish start, both
teams began to fire, exchanging
baskets one-for-one. Syracuse
soon got their offense rolling and
ran out to a 19-13 lead. Sopho-
more Matt Roe hit three
3-pointers. Roe was fould on two
of the 3-pointers and converted
the foul shots, giving him two
four-point plays. He had 11
points in the first 5‘/2 minutes.

The Panthers sliced the lead to
one, 19-18, when Demetreus
Gore and Jason Matthews scored
baskets and Matthews added a
free throw. Syracuse countered
with a rally of their own, scoring
on a Seikaly slam and two Der-
rick Coleman alley oop dunks.
Point guard Sherman Douglas
dished out the assists on Cole-
man's baskets, giving the Orange-
men a 25-18 lead.

The Panthers outscored Syra-
cuse 22-10 the remainer of the
half to take a 40-35 halftime lead.

The Panthers may have taken
a bigger lead into the half, but a
few Pitt miscues prevented it.

”l thought before the half we
could have been up by 12. We

defensive coaching reputation.
Campbell, however, feels it's
nothing new for Fazio, and his
defensive knowledge may make
him an even greater asset.

”Foge coached special teams
in college at both Pitt and Notre
Dame, so that shouldn't be a
problem for him.

”Foge is the right guy because
he's a good football coach. I see
it as a positive defensive temper-
ment,” said Campbell.

Fazio could not be reached for
comment.

Pitt, 84-75

missed a couple of layups,” said
Sean Miller, who hit five
3-pointers and scored a team-
high 18 points.

"They are a good team and
you're not going to blow them
out. When we were up by seven,
I thought we were going to win
by 10 or 12,” Miller added.

Both teams came out in the se-
cond half just like the first half:
exchanging baskets.

With Pitt holding onto a three-
point lead, 47-44, at the 16:09
mark, Syracuse
straight baskets in a minute-and-
a-half, highlighted by two mons-
trous slam dunks and a baseline
Jumper by Coleman.

Roe, whose 25 points (18 in
the first halt) led all scorers, hit an
18-footer to give Syracuse a
61-53 lead with 11:11 left.

Pitt retaliated when Miller hit a
3-pointer, Jerome Lane scored on
a layup, and Darelle Porter
scored on a fast-break layup off
his own steal. He was fouled by
Roe, and his free throw complet-
ed the three-point play, tying the
score, 61-61.

After Coleman hit a free throw
and Seikaly followed with two of
his own, Miller hit back-to-back
3-pointers, giving him three in
three minutes. Pitt led 67-64 lead
with 7:56 remaining.

The Panthers then fell into a
scoring slump, scoring only three
of the game's next 15 points. Pitt
lost its lead at 6:23 during a Syra-
cuse run, which included eight
unanswered points. Pitt never led
again.

In the last six minutes, the
Orangemen scored two baskets
for every one that Pitt scored.
Syracuse outscored the Panthers
18-9 in the final 7:09.

The Orangemen scored the
game's final two baskets on slam
dunks by Steve Thompson and
Douglas. It seemed to put an ex-
clamation mark on the statement
Syracuse wanted to make —— that
all Big East games are important.

Maybe none more than this
one.

"This was as good a game as
we'd hope to play. We've played
well in the last four or five
games,” said Boeheim.

”We wanted to run the clock
down and we can do that. Our
inside guys played well. Pitt is
very, very good. We outrebound-

Three-point baskets
help Miller return to

By Matt Martin

Assistant Sports Editor

By now, everyone knows that
Syracuse beat Pitt 84-75 last
night, decreasing the Panthers
lead in the Big East to one game
over the Orangemen and Villano-
va Wildcats.

Pitt is 16-3 overall and 6-2 in
the Big East. The Orangemen,
now 18-5 and 7-3, must hope
that the Panthers fall if they have
any chance of taking over at least
a share of first place.

And everyone knows that the
Panthers must travel to duPont
Pavilion in Philadelphia to face
Villanova Saturday night in what
is shaping up to be the most im-
portant game of the season for
both teams.

Villanova is 16-7 overall and
8-3 in the league.

But what everyone might not
know is that in last night's con-
test it was freshman point guard
Sean Miller who kept the Pan-
thers in the game, hitting five of
six 3-point field goals and scor-
»ing a team—high 18 points, most
of them at pivotal moments in the
game.

’’l was wondering when my
hot day was gonna come...Unfor-
tunately it was not enough,”
Miller said.

Very unfortunate for Miller and
Pitt. Syracuse guard Matt Roe
matched him shot for shot in the
3-point department, making four
in the first half, but outdid Miller
in total points with 25, 18 in the
first half.

”Matt Roe was a pleasant sur-
prise tonight. We've seen him
shoot like that in practice, but
never in a game," Syracuse
coach Jim Boeheim said.

Roe had hit 47 of 112 3-point
field goals prior to last night's

3 form against Syracuse

game for 42 percent.

Miller has now connected on
39 of his 80 long range attempts,
48.8 percent.

Miller played a strong game
while matched up against one of
the country's premier point
guards, Sherman Douglas.

’’I thought the game was
played even except for Sherman
Douglas. He's a great player and
great players come to play in the
clutch and he did the job for
them. He took each man he had
on him and took them one—on-
one and did the job,” Miller said.

Douglas, a 6—foot junior,
finished with 13 assists and 16
points, including a tremendous
slam dunk with :02 seconds re-
maining.

”Sherman is as good a point
guard as I've seen,” said Panther
coach Paul Evans. ”You’d prob-
ably have to break his leg [to shut
him down].”

”l just try to use my penetra-
tion, look for the shot, look for
the pass. The key in the first half
was Matt Roe,” Douglas said.

But as well as Douglas played
he could not shut down Miller.
Miller also finished with 8 assists,
one rebound and only one tur-
nover while playing all 40
minutes.

Miller continues to rewrite
Pitt's freshman season assist
record, now at 104.

All to no avail.

”Syracuse is a good team and
you're not going to blow them
out,” Miller said.

And with Villanova waiting in
the wings, Miller assured Pitt fans
that they would not see a repeat
of last night's game.

”Tomorrow [today] we'll prac-
tice as hard as any other day. And
against Villanova, I wouldn't be

ed them [44-23] and that was the
biggest shock.

”We beat a very good team
and we had to play a great basket-
ball game to do that,” Boeheim
added.

Excluding Miller, leading
scorers for the Panthers were
Lane with 16, Smith with 13 and
Martin with 10.

For the Orangemen, Seikaly
and Coleman chipped in with 18
points, while Douglas added 16.

Coleman led all rebounders
with 12 boards. Seikaly was the
only other player in double
figures, pulling down 10 boards.

The Panthers must travel to Vil-
lanova Saturday night to take on
the Wildcats [16—7, 8-3] in
another crucial Big East game.
Miller feels the game is impor-
tant, too important to let it slip
away. But he's also looking for-
ward to the rematch between Pitt
and Syracuse.

”We’re not getting down [on
ourselves]. We'll go into Villano—
va and play just as hard as we al-
ways do.

’’I hope it goes down to Pitt and
Syracuse and we win in the Car-
rier Dome [on March 6, the last
regular season game for both
teams]. That would be great,”

Pitt beat St. John's 88-71 last
week.

And if there was any doubt re-
maining as to the ability of the Pitt
freshmen playing effectively in
the Big East, it was erased last
night. Pitt's four freshman com-
bined for 38 of the Panthers’ 75
points.

Martin proved invaluable to the
Panthers, coming off the bench to

and grab three rebounds in 25

Martin was also a key factor in
shutting down lob passes from
Douglas to Syracuse big men
Rony Seikaly and Derrick Cole-
man in the first half.

Again to no avail. Syracuse's in-
side game was too powerful for
Pitt on this night.

”We have two losses, [Syra-
cuse] has three. I'd rather be us,”
Miller said.

Boeheim agreed. ’’I don't think
anyone’s gonna catch [Pitt] if they
beat Villanova Saturday.”

Women lose
at Syracuse

The Pitt Lady Panthers fell to
the Syracuse Orangewomen
in Syracuse last night, 86-50.

The loss dropped Pitt to
10-12 overall and 2-9 in the
Big East.

The Orangewomen came
out on fire and built an insur-
mountable 46-14 halftime
lead.

Lorri Johnson, Deidra Baker
and Amy Holman each scored
eight points to lead the Lady
Panthers’ attack. Johnson and
Baker each had four rebounds.
Jennifer Shingler led Pitt with
two assists.

Syracuse was led by Vera
Jones with 18 points. Tonya
Hendryx added 16 points.

Pitt was outrebounded,
57-35.

With the game out of reach,
Lady Panther coach Kirk Bruce
was able to do something not
many coaches have the luxu-
ry of doing — playing
everybody.

Karen Threatt and Holly
Holmes came off the bench to
chip in with two points each,
while freshman Whitney
Mack added two rebounds.

The Lady Panthers have five

ing — all in the Big East. Pitt

,SteeIers have need for those well-armed

£3‘:

 

By Thomas Danyluk
Staff Writer

After long hours of deliberation
and consideration, it has been
decided that the Pittsburgh Steel-
ers have picked possibly the
worst time in professional foot-
ball history to attempt to find
themselves a new quarterback —
when the chances of plucking a
good one out of the upcoming
collegiate draft or prying a
productive snaptaker from the
abundant roster of another NFL
franchise is about as likely as
findingjimmy ”The Greek” guid-

ing a group of short—tempered
NAACPers on a tour of the
Yucatan.

Can't see it.

Yet, when considering what
the Steelers posess at that position
at this very moment -- a gentle-
man who has successfully, and
quite politely, proven himself in-
effective time and time again
(Mark Malone. You remember
him, don't cha?), a second—year
second-stringer who did nothing
to convince head coach Chuck
Noll that he was just a little more
capable than Malone (Walter
Brister — maybe his sitcom nick-

name ”Bubby” has something to
do with it), and a retread from
UCLA who QBed the scab Steel-
ers back in October then found
a quiet little nook with the team
when the NFL expanded rosters
after the strike and hasn't been
heard from since (Steve Bono) —
the appropriate spokesman for
the situation becomes is none
other than Slim Pickens.

So which is it: the lesser of two
evils, or the evil of two lessers?

Steeler management, you are
not in an enviable situation.

Consider what Pittsburgh has,
at best, to chose from in the draft.

The top quarterbacks out there
this year are San Diego State's
Todd Santos, San Jose State’s
Mike Perez and Washington's
Chris Chandler.

The best of the three is Santos,
the NCAA’s all-time leader in
passing yardage. Sounds impres-
sive, right? But remember who
had the old record? Kevin
Sweeney, a kid out of Fresno
State whom the Dallas Cowboys
went ahead and drafted last
season.

Sweeney showed what he
could do, then was waived in
training camp.

Even with the downtrodden
Danny White and the inconsis-
tent Steve Pelleur as the only real
competition in camp, he couldn't
make the team. Sweeney was
eventually invited back to Dallas
when the strike struck, then made
the club even after the regulars
returned. Still, his impact with the
Cowboys was about as resound-
ing as Bono’s in Pittsbur h.

Chandler and Perez, an throw
in Florida's Kerwin Bell, well, the
jury is out, even as far as left field,
on those players. Pro scouts con-
sider them projects at best.

And if the Steelers actually do
want these people, a whole slew
of teams that are also craving
quarterbacks are drafting miles
ahead of Pittsburgh.

The trade scenario is a little less
hard on the eyes, at least in terms
of what is potentially available.
But the process of persuading the
respective franchises to give up
these so-called available players
is about as thrilling as spending
Saturday night in the William Pitt
Union Video Room watching re-
runs of James at 16.

Here's what's supposedly out
there (and remember, look but no
touch):

Steve Young, San Francisco
49ers —— No chance snaring this
guy. With starter Joe Montana
getting ever so older, and con-
sidering how brilliantly effective
Young was while Montana was
injured, Bill Walsh's 49ers have
him about penned in as their no-
lose quarterback of the future.

Tommy Kramer, Minnesota
Vikings — Has battled injuries
and alcoholism, not necessarily
in that order, and the young, de-
veloping Wade Wilson has some-
what established himself as the
starter with his performance at
the end of the season and in the
playoffs. Yet, with Kramer's re-
maining ability and superb
knowledge of the game, he
would be too fine a backup, a
Don Strock—type relief pitcher, for
the Vikes to give up.

Steve DeBerg, Tampa Bay Buc-
caneers -— Same situation here.
With Vinny Testaverde the main
man for coach Ray Perkins, De-
Berg will most likely be kept
around to cultivate and fine-tune
Testaverde. And, more important-
ly, DeBerg was never a winner as
a starter to begin with.

Matt Cavanaugh, Philadelphia

Eagles — Once upon a time for
this nonspectacular veteran. ,

Tony Eason, New England‘

Patriots — The club probably
would consider trading Eason,
but not at this moment. Eason has
been brilliant, uneffective, but
even more so, injured. The Pats
still aren't really sure of what he's
capable of doing. And so the po-
sition in New England is still to
unstable for any moves of that
magnitude to be considered safe
for the Patriots.

Todd Blackledge, Kansas City
Chiefs —— The one getting the
most attention through all of this,
and why the Steelers want him is
a major mystery. Blackledge, the
bust of the Quarterback Draft of
1983, never even came close to
developing in then-head coach
John Mackovic’s high-powered
passing offense, losing the job
several times —- now for good, it
seems — to Bill Kenney. Present-
ly, the Chiefs seem interested in
getting rid of him and his high sa-
lary contract, and the Pittsburgh
management is salivating like it
hasn't even nibbled on crumbs in
months.

See what too little foresight and
too much Cliff Stoudt and Mark
Malone can do to ya?

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, February II, I988

Two injured as Panther wrestlers upset by
Kent State, get ready for Nittany Lions

By Vince Carey

Assistant Sports Editor

The Pitt wrestling team came
crashing down Tuesday night in
a 21-1 5 loss to Kent State
University.

The loss puts the Panthers at
7-4-1 an the season.

”This was a weird night,” Pitt
head coach Rande Stottlemyer
said. "A couple of guys looked
real good, but all that counts is
what the final score reads.”

One of the ”weir ” things that
happened came early. In the
126-division, Pitt's Matt Gerhard
was winning his match when he
was suddenly turned over when
blood started coming from his
mouth.

Gerhard couldn't continue and
Kent State was awarded six points
on a default.

The second came at 177
pounds; Panther Mike Tongel
had a big lead late when he twist-
ed his ankle.

”Mike may be out for the sea-
son because of the ankle,” Stott-
lemyer said. ”We don't know the
extent of the injury at this time.
Same with Matty, it all depends
on how fast he can heal.”

Stottlemyer singled out fresh-
man Scott Hovan as the most im-
pressive wrestler of the night for
his upset of Dave Yersey.

”Scott really came out to wres-
tle,” Stottlemyer said. ”He
looked strong and beat a guy who
had beaten him before. It was
good for Scott to get Yersey off his
hit list.”

But there is no rest for the Pan-
thers, they travel to Penn State
this Sunday.

”Penn State is going to be very
tough,” Stottlemyer said. ”They
are coming off a great win against
Iowa, so they should be
gunning.”

All-America Pat Santoro (38-0)
returns to the Panther lineup af-
ter receiving a one—meet rest. He
will face Penn State's Rob Meloy.

”I really don't know if the
layoff will hurt me until I step
onto the mat,” Santoro said. ”I
have wrestled him before, and I
know that he tries to slow things
down. He will be hard to wres-
tle. I'll just have to do my best."

A turning point in the meet
may be at 150 pounds. Hovan
will be facing last year's EWL
champion Sean Finkbeiner.

”The only way I can beat him
is by cutting down on my mis-
takes,” Hovan said. ”For us to

win the meet, we have to wres-
tle hard and pull off a lot of
upsets.”

In Pitt's favor will be the fact
that PSU is facing West Virginia
earlier Sunday. Yet, this may be
evened out by the loss of Tongel
and Gerhard.

’’we’ll get a chance to see
them before they wrestle us; plus,
they may not be at top form,”
Santoro said. "I think the fill ins
will do good; they have been
practicing all year and should be
ready."

”We’re looking forward to the
challenge,’’ Stottlemyer said. ”All
I can ask is that the guys go out
and give their best.”

The Panthers will return home
on Feb. 20 to face EWL rival
Clarion. It is Pitt's last home meet
of the season.

Panthers continue good football recruiting

(AP) — The University of Pitts-
burgh announced the signing of
15 players to binding letters of in-
tent Wednesday, including prep
All-America linebackers Curtis
Bray and Mike Chalenski.

Coach Mike Gottfried said he
expected 12 more players to sign
binding letters by the end of the
day and that he anticipates giving
out the maximum 30 scholar-
ships by this spring.

A total of 26 prep players gave
oral commitments to Pitt before
Wednesday, the first day when
high school players could official-
ly sign binding letters of intent.

The 6-foot-4, 220-pound Bray
from Gateway High in suburban
Pittsburgh and the 6-5,
240—pound Chalenski from David
Brearley High in Kenilworth, N.J.,
both made the USA Today All-
America team.
