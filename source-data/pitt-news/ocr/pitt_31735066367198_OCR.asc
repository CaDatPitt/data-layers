Inter-Fraternity Council president, Jim Groninger, will
present the council’s views on deferred _rushing at next

University Seal
Takes Form of
Coat-of-Arms

The University seal is now in
.a different form. In place of the
circular shape found on seals for-
incrly used, the shape now re-
sembles a coat-of-arms.

Since the University’s by-laws
do not include any specification
.for‘ a University seal, there is no
one official emblem. There. are,
however, several approved ver-

proved by the Board of Directors,"
said Russell Jalbert, director of
public relations.

The new emblem still retains
the symbolism of the three rivers
s u r r o u n din g Pittsburgh, the
candle symbolizing Truth and
Virtue, and the lighter lines stem-
ming from the candle and sym-
bolizing knowledge.

Appearing on the seal is the
motto “Veritas et Virtus.” This
phrase was taken from an earlier
seal, and means “truth and ‘he-
roic manhood.”

Asto the reason for a change
in the University seal, Mr. J albert
said: “We feel it is more read-
able. The seal was changed main-
ly for typographic purposes. The

‘as an element of design.” .
, He also pointed out that sev-
eral versionsof the circular seal
are now in use on blazers and
various other campus materials.
Therefore the new seal can be
accepted without causing con-
flicts.

The seal has already been used
on the students handbook, Uni-

versity stationary, and notebooks.

of deferred rushing. Garfinkci
previously stated that the relega-
tion of rushing to the second tri-
mester would enable students to
become better adjusted socially‘
and academically before the fra-
ternity selection program begins
Chuck Isler, president of SG,
reiterated at the meeting that
all invoices must be stamped for
admission to football games. The
invoices can be stamped in the
Office of Student Records on the
18th floor. Cl. ,

Isler apologized for the lack of
a student pep rally before last
wee.k’s game. He said that lack of
time and non-coordination‘ of
various agancies were responsible
for the poor "showing. “‘A com-
mittee will be formed to organize
rallies in the future,” Isler said.

The next rallywill be held Fri-
day evcning at 7.230 p.m. in the SU.

Gauguin’s Art
Scheduled For
Lecture Series

A series of ﬁve lectures
lectures taking their theme
fr 0 m the exhibition Art
Nouveau will be given by
Gordon Washburn in the Lec-
ture Hall of Carnegie Insti-
tute beginning Oct. 18.

The first lecture, “Gauguin and
Art Nouveau," will introduce
Gauguin as the major inﬂuence on
painting at the turn of the cen-
tury, when the Art Nouveau style
flourished.

In addition, there will also be
comments on the architecture and
decorative arts included in the ex-
hibition from the Museum of Mod-
ern Art-in New York-

The following four lectures
will continue to trace, the devel-
Onment of the modern move-
ment in art from this point of

‘ departure. Each will concen-
trate on a key artist as the focal
point of a major trend in twen-

 tieth century painting.

“Matisse and the Fauves” will
beithe topic for Oct. 25; “Picasso
and Cubism” on Nov. 1; “Klee and
Expressionism” on Nov. 8; and
"Miro and Surrealism” on Nov. 15.

Washburncontends that the at-
titude of the artist in modern
times is directly related to the
initial direction of Gauguin’s work.

The exhibition, open to the pub- -

lie on Oct. 21, will contain a num-
ber of notable and valuable can-
vases by Gauguin, including his

.“Yellow Christ,” “Agony in the

Garden,” and “Still Life with
.Three.Puppies,” as well as many
of his woodcuts.

  A Re pu

The intelligent voter in 1960 must realistically
choose one of the two sets of candidates offered by
[the Republican and Democratic parties. Consider-
‘ing these two sets of candidates the voter, can
easily see, along with Walter B.
Judd, Republican keynote speak-
er, that the ENDS desired by
both parties and their candidates
are the same due to international
and internal pressures and re-
sponsibilities of the current
world.
Some of these same goals are
freedom from communism and
its implications. “peace with dig-
nity,” and a. high standard of __
-‘living. ' ‘ .
The decisions between candidates, then, must
,come through a comparison between the voter’s

‘personal philosophy and that of the candidates as
to the MEANS that will be used to‘ secure these
ends. Taking into consideration the responsibility
of the individual in a democratic society, we must .
. make every conceivable effort, to evaluate the
e . methods that the candidates have chosen to be
most successful in obtaining their common goals.
Less Centralized Means ‘

Nixon and Lodge, the Republican can-
didates, advocate attaining our common goals by
a less centralized means than their opposition.
That is, they want to limit, rather than increase
the functions of central government. “Power,” as
«Lord Acton said, “corrupts men.” "Absolute
power,” he added, “corrupts absolutely.” Nixon is
in favor of holding taxes steady or reducing them
if possible, while letting _many things be done by
the local and state governments.

The Democrats, on the other hand, are still
trying to sell the Roosevelt “New Deal" idea of
letting the Federal Government control and manage
everything. This was dramatically demonstrated
to us this ‘summer when Kennedy took such .a F
.radical stand on “minimum wage” and “old age
beneﬁts,” which even the Democrat—ma.jority Sen-
ate did not pass. v

’ At the same time he is “striving” for more
Federal “benefits” and control, he promises, of

‘paid to them. this year than usually.
Analysis and evaluation of the
platforms should be essential ~
criteria for. the choosing of our.
next administration.

Both platforms go through

the ritual of condemning Com-
munism in all forms and re-
spects. One of the ‘signiﬁcant
differences between them, how-
ever lies in their attitude con-
s cerning recognition of Red
China. . . _
I The Democratic pla tform
-says: “Although normal diplomatic relations be- 5
tween our two governments are impossible under
«present conditions, we shall welcome any-' evidence
that the Chinese ‘government is genuinelyprepared
_._to create a new relation based on respect for in-
ternational obligations including‘ the release of
American prisoners.” '
The Republican platform states: “Recognition of
_ Communist China and its admission to the United
Nations have been ﬁrmly opposed by the Repub-
A lican adrninistration. We will continue in this
. opposition . . .’ ’
A Leaves Door Open —

The Democratic platform, tlien, leaves the door
ope_n to possible United States recognition of the
Agover-nm,ent of Communist China, while’ the Repub-
licans exclude this, possibility completely.

The head-in-the—sand policy of eternal non-
recognition /hardly seems to fit the “practical”
label which the Republicans have attached to their

_ platform. Certainly non-recognition has great
popular appeal, and this may well be the reason
A why the Republicans have clung so tenaciously to
this concept. A truly “practical” and sober con-
sideration of the matter reveals that we may lose
_ more by pampering our’ national} pride ‘than we
would by facing the realities of {today’s interna-
i ~ tiona-l power politics. . f T-
. First, our continued non-recoignition of Red
law‘ b r pres ige‘ among the underde-

course, reduced‘ taxes. He is‘ demanding increased

disbursements for welfare (health, education, and
‘social security payments) and for national pro-

- grams involving schools and ‘teacher subsidation.

Reduce. Yet ‘Increase ,
Any interested voter with some knowledge of

‘economicscwould like to know how taxes are to be

reduced .(one of our common goals) while increas-
ing spending. This is either the deliberate false
promise of a party interested in a welfare state or,
the rash promise of complete fools.

. If it is the promise of a_party desirous" of A

creating a welfare state then we must keep in
mind the statement of the late Senator Robert
Taft: “You can socialize just ‘as well by a steady
increase in the burdela, of taxation beyond the
thirtypercent we have already reached as you can
by government seizure. .The very imposition of
heavy taxes is a limit on a man’s freedom."
Another area of concern is Mr. Kennedy’s policy
of more ‘federal subsidies for school teachers. .Is
Federal aid needed? The White House Conference
on Education in 1955 was an elaborated eﬁort to
demonstrate popular support for federal aid. De-
spite the popular conclusion that aid was needed,
“No state represented,” the Conference stated, “has
a demonstrated‘ financial incapacity to build the
schools they will need during the» next ﬁve years.
What Is Locking? . " A
I What is lacking, the report went on,‘ is not
money, but a “political determination powerful
enough to overcome allthe obstacles.” If State X
possesses the wealth to educate its children ade-

-quately but has failed to utilizeits wealth for that

purpose, it is up to the people of State X to take

remedial action through their local and state

governments. , p

“The Federal government has neither the right
nor the duty to, intervene,” says Senator Barry
Goldwater of Arizona. ,

Upon re-reading the Constitution of the United
States one is reminded that the men who organized
our government were profoundly interested in
keeping the democratic power in the hands of the

individual citizen. This individual control and lib-
erty can then only be regained if Nixon and.

Lodge are elected by people who want to
keep the dignity and individ.uality a Republican
administration assures.

Foreign Policy

the greatest economic power ‘in Asia. Every day
more Asians are expressing “unrestrained admira-
tion’_ for the economic gains of their sister country.
By not allowing .a possibility of recognition we are
only giving validity to‘ Chinese claims that the
United States is only a “paper tiger” unable to
compete with them "on a world market.

It is useless to say that by recognizing Red
China we _will be giving her world prestige.
Whether we like‘ ittor not., a “practical” analysis
tellsvus that she already has it on a world wide

"basis. ‘

We Are Denied Information
Second, by not recognizing Red China, weare

denied a vital source of information about six’

hundred million people, nearly one quarter of the
world's population. ‘A United States embassy in
Communist China would provide us with-ﬁrst hand
information concerning Chinese public opinion,
domestic and international, the effectiveness of Red
anti-American propaganda, the true facts of. Chi-
nese economic and military gains, and might eve
be used as- a base of spy operations. ‘

Peiping is now an unknown quantity which
must be made known if United States Asian
foreign policy is to be intelligently formulated.

Third, now that more nations of the World are
becoming members of the nuclear weapons club,
the need for disarmament is becoming increasingly
strong._ There is much evidence that Red China
may soon join this club. How can effective world
nuclear disarmament, which is our only hope of
survival, be accomplished without the consent of
the third most powerful country in the world‘? By
not recognizing this power we cannot hope to es-
tablish a foundation through which universal nu-
clear disarmament can be made to work.

The fact that the Red Chinese are now boasting
that they can afford a nuclear war makes it more,
not less, imperative that they"be included in any

discussions, not for purposes of appeasement, but

for purposes of realistic diplomacy.

The realities of foreign policy are sometimes
inundated by the emotionalism of public opinion.
They must be raised to their proper perspective.
The. harsh realities of today’s world problems tell
us that it is now impossible for us to continually
pick up our marbles and go home when we feel
~ ulted. i o o

Ahead, a yellow light switches ,

red. The red Ford keeps going
at the same speed. When the car
is about two hundred feet from
the light, its brake lights» flash
on, it jolts forward, its wheels
whine slightly, and it begins im-
mediately to slow down. De-
cclerating. quickly, it comes to a
stop right behind the crosswalk
line. It lurches backwards on its
, springs and rocks to a Stop.

While the red Ford waits, the
blue one, 150 yards behind,
moves along at :a' leisurely. 25

the smooth asphalt. The car ad-.
vances steadily at an even speed.

The "light ahead is still red.

it will struggle to a stop and
wait for the blue car.
Excellent ‘Discrimination

V Millions of. people, drive as
‘stupidly as does the driver of the
“bad” car above. In cities, where
traffic is thick and where traffic
lights are placed close together,
they are relatively harmless. Ev-.
eryone needs to have his fun;
these drivers get their “kicks”

‘ out of plunging their right feet

down to the floor, then their left 0

feet down -—— sometimes alter-
nately, and sometimes simul-
taneously.

In the city, they usually ca_n’t
get up enough speed to do more
than bash up fenders, bumpers,

trunks, and the like. But. when ,

theyget out on road; where they

«have room to speed, it’V_s'_',a "dif-

These speeders, driving both

trucks and automobiles, are

menaces- ' ‘

trucker. Yet, they drive, as if
they do. They cause accidents,

* not only smashing into someone"
~. who makes a mistake, but by

making mistakes themselves.
How to control “speeding?”

‘Well, we have speed limits en-.
forced by uniformed state troop-.
_ers who drive marked. cars. But

“speeders” ignore this threat of

‘ . getting caught and later punish-

ed. They rocket along the high-
way, dividing their attention to
the drivingoconditions ahead of
them, and the mirrored image of
the road behind them. So long
as they don’t see a trooper, they
keep speeding past other cars, up
and down hills, and around
bends, bent on “making time.”

Against these persons, ordi- T"
nary rnethods of law enforce-

ment are useless.

Two weeks ago, Govrnor
Lawrence ordered a “crack-
down” on speeders on the Turn-

pike and Penn-Lincoln ‘Bark-

way._He directed State Troopers
to patrol these roads while wear-

ing plain-clothes and driving un-
_marked, cars. The, Governor, as
>well-as reporters in all the news ‘ '

media, explained the “crack-
down” with disgustingly unnec-
essary apologies.

Soon there followed cries of

“unfair,” “undemocratic,” “total-

itarian” and so on.
Objections Are Absurd

The whole .-matter is stupid.
“Fair play” doesn’t enter here.
Nor does a persons’s “right to
privacy.” A person’s privacy is

-not being invaded by a non~uni-

formed policeman patrolling the
highway, as. it wouldbe by a
microphone hidden behind a pic-
ture in. the home. _ - 5

Imagine trying to catch’ pick-
pockets, shoplifters, and, narco-
tics pushers withluniformed po-
licemen. I -7;

Here, there is no creeping
“total_itarism.” {or creeping any-
thing else, for that matter); pa-

trolling the highway against laws
made for everyone’s beneﬁt is .

direct enforcement or a law in
the ﬁeld where’-the law is violat-
ed, not a means of collecting evi-
dence on violations which occur
clsewhere._

Instead of apologizing for ‘Stak-

‘ should have apologized for fail-

ing to actin this manner earlier.

Students Asked
To Back Grid
Team Saturday a

By TED COLTON
Sports Ed.1'.to'r

 

This Saturday the Pitt Panthers open their 1-960 home
football season against Michigan State, a team the Cats have
never beaten. This will be the students’ ﬁrst chance to get a
glimpse of their gridiron heroes.

In past years the University has had what can be con-
sidered as a major problem. Pitt, being for the most part a
commuters school, has had very little student attendance at
their football games. L _

During the years after World War I, the students sec-
tion was always ﬁlled to the brim. But year after year the
students began to dwindle. Their seat allotment was cut down
and now even this small seating arrangement 1S not being
ﬁlled. A ‘
Last year, as was the practice in previous ones,

game after game went by With 09911 SD39}? 1“ the Sm‘
dent section. Sometimes the rest of the stadium would be
full but not the student section. ' V .

I look for 1960 to add a change to all this football scene.

Pitt is rapidly becoming a campus school. There are Stlll 3

great number of commuters but each year more and m

students start living on campus. _ . _ « , ,
There have been more student activities added and this

in turn has led to greater unity among the student body.

In juries Plague Cats
As Vignali, Coustillac
Head Sick List

By ‘JACK SMITH

The injury ridden Panthers
may have their hands full as
they encounter a highly tout-
ed Michigan State eleven
Saturday at 1 p.m. in the
Cats’ first game at the Sta-
diurn.

Plagued with a lack of depth in
the line, the Panthers received a
severe blow when Larry Vignali
was sidelined ' by a dislocated
shoulder in the UCLA game. “Vig-
nali, who has been rated as one
of the best linemen in the East,
was counted on to stabilize our
defense," Line Coach Jack Wiley
said.

Regis Coiistillac, who broke his
left thumb in a preseason scrim-
mage. may return io action Sat-
urday.

All-American Mike Ditka has
been hampered by a bruised‘ rib
cage and Center Dick Matyus
has an infected arm: however,
both are slated for competition.

Scouts who have watched Mich-
igan State perform, claim their
double-wing-attackis packed with
power. Halfback Fred Atterley,
who runs the 100-yard dash in 9.8
seconds, is the man to watch, ob-

At Schenley Oval

Coaches Leo Bemis and Dave
Starret have announced that 43
teams have signed up to play in
the university’s intramural foot-
ball_ league. They have an-
nounced also that applications
will still be accepted for inde-
pendent tea-ms. g

The program consists of four
leagues with various atliliations.
The in1'i‘a-fraternity loop has ap-
proximately l5 teams entered in
the competition. There are eight
teams from the engineering de-
partment.

The biggest league will draw at
least 12 teams from the dormitor-
ies. The Independent group has
eight tcamsso far, but more are
expected to join.

Each league will conduct its own
schedule. The top two teams in
each section will compete in play-
offs for the campus championship.

The Panthers made the mistake
of playing their running game too

cording to Coach John Michelosen.
However, Michelosen plans to re-
verse his strategy against the un-
tested Spartans who are playing
their first game,

halfback can run or pass, to good '

We lost many a game for want of
one good block. This should be
taken care of this year.” ’
Noticably missing from the
Spartan attack in the last two
years was the long run which
used to shock opponents and
provide thrills for State fans.
With Adderley and Ballman in
the backﬁeld, the opposition had

, better beware.

Some sophomore candidates who
deserve mention are Lonnie Sand-
ers, Jim Bobbitt, George Azar,
Dave Behrman, Ron Watkins, Jim
Eaton and Herb Paterra.

and Carnegie Tech for the city col-
lege championship. Last year this
was not completed when schedul-
ing diﬂiculties occurred.

All games will be si.a_gc<i at
Schenloy Oval, the same sight as
last season. In 1959 there were 42
teams entered and over 500 stu-

.dents played in 125 games.

“The Chinese Bandits” copped
the University crown last year.
They competed in the independent
league and their membership con-

sisted of athletes from various
\-'a1'sity sports.
This should encourage more

teams to join this same circuit.
All teams are composed of six
men, with four reserves. Bemis
and Starret will accept your ap-
plication at the field house.

Last year Recs was satislicad
with his iirst three staiicrs. Ron
Rush, Reed Clarke, and Mickey
Jupina, who ﬁnished first, second,
and ﬁlth respectively. Rush has
graduated, but both Clarke and
Jupina are returning. Both have
won two letters in the sport.

Veterans Bill Hinchbergcr, Don-
ald Adams and Bob Stuck are also
back in good form. They would
like nothing better than to avenge
last year’s upset.

The newcomers whom Rees is
banking his hopes on will get

the University with people who
will be willing to give competent
and enthusiastic leadership,” Loli-
rentz said.

“Such items as leadership
principles, governmental organi-
zation, parliamentary procedure,
activity development and evalu-"
ation, and the responsibilities
and ethics of leadership would
be some of the aspects to be in-
cluded in a healthy program,”
he said.

Garﬁinkel added that leaders
trained under such a program
could be used to help orient and
guide freshmen men.

Senators Elected

“We could possibly establish a
male counterpart to the women’s
mentor system,” he suggested.
Further study of such a program
will be discussed at future meet-
ings.

Elections to ﬁll vacated Sen-
ate seats were also held. Elected
senior senators were Jean Don-
ehoo . and Phil Brown; junior
elcctee was Sandy Senior. In a
competitive sophomore ra ce-
during which seven names were
submitted to ﬁll two positions,
Al Resnick and John Gedid were
victorious.

The graduate school will be re-
presented by Fred Ackerman, En-
gineering and Mines by Woody
Higgins, and the School of Edu-
cation by Jean Logan.
