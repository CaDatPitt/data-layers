Bo0ster’s Meeting

’A Success

Student Speakers Manifest much Col-
lege Spirit.

‘A student meeting was held last
,Wednesday during ‘chapel hour, in
the ‘chapel, the results of which and
of like meetings planned for the fu-
ture will be the awakening of a true
college spirit among the Pitt students.
Professor Fetterman said, “It was the
best meeting held by the student
body in a long time and all who
were there agreed with him. The

_ trend of the whole meeting, the. domi-

nant thought of every speech was
brieﬂy——Boost_ Pitt.

B. F. Ashe, ’13, was chairman, and
made some excellent remarks. “What
we need,” he said, “is constructive in-
stead of destructive criticism. Pick

. out Pitt's many good points and boost

them instead of knocking her few bad
ones.” After a number of similar

~good instructions he announced that

the following speakers were_ boosters
and that the students should take

their remarkc to heart and spread

them among the absent students.

‘ Wettach, ’13,, was the first speaker
and he urged the students at all

' stimes ‘to boost Pitt and support the
. school’ loyally. He told of his expe-
I rience in boosting and showed how
easy it is to impress upon outsiders

what a ‘wonderful school Pitt is.
Holliday, ’12, as was natural and ﬁt

— pointed out to the students their obli-

gations in regard to the “Owl’f and
stated that “this year it was the best
ever.”

Marshall, ’11, defended the" stand
which he had to take with regard to
knocking. “My knocking has always
been constructive and not destructive.
My object has always been to remedy
some evil,” he said, earnestly. He stat-
ed that Pitt was becomingxbetter each
year—that each new class excelled
the preceding one. '0

Stewart, ’12, told the students that

this meeting was not under the care

of the chancellor, but that he was
miles away, coiseqeutnly they need

/not fear that the end would disclose

a plan to get a new student building
for Pitt. Stewart then gave a good
description of what a girl does not do
and what she does do when a young
/n:-an calls on her.
he left to the students to applyto
themselves regarding Pitt.

Track Team Does g

ing of-points, the events were all
closely contested and exciting and
good time was made: The time made
at our intercollegiate compared favor-
ably with that at Harrisburg; the

quarter and half. mile being faster
and the discus throw being better.

The team started well in the trial
heats, qualifying in all entered ex-
cept the 100 yard dash and in men-
nal heats scored in every one entered.
Tinsley scored highest with 41/; taking

‘second in the pole, vault and high

jump. Galvin’ scored 4 points, taking
third in the shot put and hammer
throw. Bryson scored 3 points, taking
fourth in the 440 and third in the
half mile and Rosenthal scored one
point by taking fourth in the 220.

Captain Bryson deserves much cred-
it for the work of the track team this
year as the lack of candidates dimmed
the chances from the start of the sea-
hon; «his untiring_ efforts, however,

gave the team a fairly good showing '

and his good work on the track in
the quarter and half , mile events-
helped throughout the season. With
the troubles and worries of the cap-
taincy renioved next year, he will un-
doubtedly do splendid work on the
track as he is an untiring worker and
‘game to the core. The t eam will
assemble at Johnson’s studio at 2.00
o’clock on next Thursday for a group

The Engineering school is planning
to establish a new department—that

of Sanitary Engineering. In charge

of this branch of work will be Mr.
Morris Knolleh, one of the best known
Mr. Knowles has been consulting en-

gineer of "the Pittsburgh Filtration
Plant and has sad much experience to
qualify him for his new position. Pitt
is extremely fortunate to secure such
a strong man for the new department.
The new department will co-operate
with city and state sanitary depart-
ments and with the medical school.
It will take an important position
along all lines of public health work.
The course will be divided into three
partsi engineering, scientiﬁc or from
the bacteriological side and training
of health inspectors.‘ The latter part
is practically an innovation as plan-

’ ned, giving a training adopted as yet

adopted by no other school. Profes-

a series of public lectures alongithis
line.

LARGE APPROPRIATION
FROM STATE.

Legislature Passes Pitt's

Grant

Finally

Both houses of the Legislature have
now ﬁnally passed the appropriatinon
bills giving $400,000 to the'Universi-
ty of Pittsburgh. According to the
latest advices the Governor will prob-
ably sign the bills. As yet no cer-
tain information can be secured as to
the ﬁnal disposition of this money.
‘But it is probable that a part of the
grant will be used to build a new den-
tistry building. Large additions are
also planned to the group of buildings

‘EXAMINATIONS

It is now rapidly approaching the
end of the term. With commence-
m.ent comes the vacation, much
longed for in hot weather. But with
vacation comes also the somewhat
less desirable tests‘ with which we
end the year. Of course, very few men
need :6‘ study to pass these so-called
tests, but there is a small group in

deavor to do three months’ work in

men to get to work, if they desire to
pass. And to the man who desires to
pass with credit we would say that
allittle hard work from now to the
end of the term would do no harm.

. The professors are now tightening
up their work. The students must
also put a few more hard ‘days in re-

viewing the work which they have.

covered during the last term. ' Let

BOOSTER MEETING A SUCCESS

(Continued from page 1.)

it was -far easier to be a booster
than otherwise, for we have so many
things of which to be proud". He al-
so spoke of the plans for the “future
of the Pitt,Weekly and earnestly de-
siredthat the student body should re-
alize that theLWeekly is the students’
paper -and that they should give it
their support in every way po_ssible.
Miller, ’14 made quite a hit by sug-

gesting. that the meeting was an old

Methodist revival and that he “Jim-
my,” had been called. upon for his
“sperience.” He declared he doubted
if a Freshman had anything so valu-
able as an ex-p—eri.ence, but they did get
impressions and he proceeded to give
his impressions when he entered Pitt.

alty_ and service to Pitt. He said that
upon entering the younger men
should receive this inquiry from the
upper class men, “What_ are you go-
ing to do for Pitt?” Only a feeling
of obligationL and indebtedness to
one’s college can bring about true
service for that college.

Archer, ’11, then spoke for several
m.inutes. He heartily endorsed all
that had been previouslysaid and
hoped that the students would show
the results of these boosters’ speech-
es ‘by more college spirit and boost-
ing of Pitt. He liked Stewart’s idea
of thinking of the campus as covered
with beautiful white snow. whenever
its present aspect grows tiresome.
Boost Pitt’s good points, try to eradi-
cate her weaknesses and evils with-
out shouting them aloud’to the pub-
lic. ' A

Kirk, ’13 spoke last and certainly
he grew enthusiastic. -He declared

that the college spirit needed at Pitt

was the kind that awakened a man,
that made shivers run up and down

his spine, and that caused him to act.

This same spirit is felt when one at-
tends.._.a real -student meetingat some
large college. The contatc with such
men, meeting them, the sensation
caused by listening to a collegesong
sung by a large crowd of enthusiastic
men, all help to bring about that un-
explainable something which the ob-
server feels is present—college spirit.
Kirk’s suggestiontof step songs was
heartily seconded by Dr. Frost. Tra-
ditions do a great deal toward making
spirit. ' LL

These were the speakers and a few
of their remarks. The meeting was
opened by a very excellent vocal solo
by Miss Carnahan-, ’14, “Hail to Pitt,’-’
was sung about the middie of the pro-
gram and Kirk led in-an “Allegience”
at the end. It can safelybe said
that no student was present who
didn’t feel that he was the better for
being present.‘ It is hoped that the
“boosters” -have more plans uptheir
sleeves and that more meetings "will
follow. 5 '

underweight,‘ so the examiner,-whom‘
-he knew, put the scale at 150 pounds-~
told him to give a hard jumpwn and;

then off before the scale could settle.
So he weighed over 150 pounds. But
in spite of starting out under weight,
thearmy life agreed with him and he

rapidly gained weight. He said that
one-half of the boys fell through weak- /

ness, just because they were not ﬁt-
ted for war. As a rule, the good boys
fell, out-. It was the -“survival of the
toughest.” So, out of their company
of one thousand men only two hun-
dred and ﬁfty came "back. But these
few were worth the full company, be-
cause each one was a" general. I ‘

_- Mr. Wilson gave a clear account of

the causes and results of the war. He;

said that the real cause of it was se-
cession. They never thought of slav-
ery when enlisting. tlt‘-was-‘the abso-
lute "belief of the North that secession
could not be tolerated--one moment,

that the Union must be preserved. On "I

the other hand, the LSouth believed

just astruly in the sovereigntyof the. ‘

State and its right to secede. Both
sides believed they were right, and it
required a great cost in lives, labor
and money to remove, ‘such a moun-
tain. Mr. Wilson commented at

length upon the Southern soldiers, ,

than whom there have never been any
better. There was no spirit of murder

in the war, no cold blood shed. In the I

truces, the soldiers from both ranks
would mingle in the friendliest way,
trading tobacco and rations. Never
would the enemy ﬁre after’ a truce
ended until everybody was back safe

in the lines. This spirit was‘e‘xempli-’ _

other wars. Few of us ever imagine
that a friendly spirit. existed between
the Northern and Southern armies
such as Mr. Wilson described.

The results of the war which Mr.

aWilson assures us were well worth the

cost, were next considered. One was
the beneﬁt to the West, for almost
one-half o fthe men who came back
from the war went West. They were
dissatisﬁed in their quiet homes and
were just the kind of men needed to
build up-the West. Another result,
which Colonel Schoonmaker
about was the formation of a national
spirit at home which now puts us in
the front row in the congress of the
nations. Probably the best result was

' the new South. A few years ago, Mr.
VVilson traveled over some of the a

South through which he had marched
years before. He was an army sur-
veyor and knew the ground especially
well. But conditions had changed sh

"that he could scarcely recognize a

thing or ﬁnd a trace of former places.
Chattanooga had changed from a vil-
lage of 3 or 4 thousand to a city of 7’,-
OOO inhabitants. The population of
Atlanta had increased from 3,000 to
200,000. These changes in population
only denote the marvelous changes in
other things. Manufacturing has de-
veloped. Instead of immense planta-

-tions, one can see many well—tilled

farms. Where there were no school-
houses, we now have schoolhouses for
both blacks and whites every few
miles. These are blessings due to the
war.

Inthe closing speech, Mr. Alexander
Hamilton spoke of our duty to this na-
tion at present. He impressed upon
us our service in peace to establish
good government.

,The students enjoyed the speeches
greatly and felt that an hour spent in
honor of this nation’s heroes makes us
better citizens and incvreases our pa-
triotism.

ALUMCNI DIBECTORY

Engineering School Issues New Di-

recory.

. The Engineering School hasjust. is-
sued its new alumni directory. This
book ns completely up-to-date giving
every class from 1846 until 1911. To

"most of us it is a surprise to learn
that our‘ engineering school was is-.
‘ suing degrees as far back as 1846. But

the University of Pittsburgh, or old
W. U. P., was one of the ﬁrst schools

in this country to give an engineering

degree. A studdy of the new direc-
tory discloses the»fact that our alumni
include many of the leaders in engi-
neering. Almost ‘every large engi-
neering ﬁrm in Pennsylvania has
among its managers a graduate of this
school.

THE PITT WEEKLY

recommended by the Board of Control
as announced in the last issue of the

class. "In accordance with the con-
stitution the following men were elect-

THE 1913 OWL

we are pleased to note that the
Sophomore Class acted so speedily
upon the suggestion in the last issue
of this paper. We believed. that it
was very late for the election of the
board for next year. But the Sopho-
when its, duty was once called to its
attention, has largely removed the
fault. We observe with ‘pleasure that
as a whole the new Owl board is a
strong one. We extend to it our con-

gratulations and our best wishes for

its success. May next year’s Owl be
the “best ever.” \ 0 -

To the Editor of the Pitt Weekly:—

The Board of Control wishes to ex-
press to the student ‘body, through
the columns of the “Weekly,” the re-
sults secured in auditing the accounts
of the 1911 Owl.

The accounts were found to be cor-
rect. The Board wishes to express.
to Mr. Estabrook, the Business Mana-
ger of the Owl, their appreciation of
the business—like manner in which he
had his books and accounts arranged,
which facilitated greatly the work of
auditing the auditing committee.

the time when the Rev. Heman Dyer
was chancellor.

Mr. Lutton was compelled to leave
school before the completion of his
course, to assist his father who held
a very responsible position at the
Schoenberger Mill. Mr. Lutton was
Boss Sheet Roller there from 1848 to
1868, when he obtained the same po-
sition in Coleman’s mill. In 1872 he
was Boss Sheet Roller at the Clinton
Iron Works and in 1873 again held

the same ‘position with the Wayne ‘

Iron and Steel Co., (Brown’s Mill).
In 1883 he retired from active work to
look after his interests in real es-
tate. ’

Mr. Lutton has ever had the inter-
ests of his Alma Mater at heart and

co_ATLEss STUDENTS. -

 

The almost unbearable weather of
the last week has given rise to a ques-

tion of college conventfo!Yaiity' which‘ ‘

just at present is causing no little
comment among the students. Sev-
eral of the professo-rs say that it is
entirely too wide a breach of etiquette
for the students to remove‘ their coats
in the class rooms and the students

think that etiquette or not it is too.

hot to wear coats any place. Hence”
the racket.

It may be that going without coats

in the class room is not the accepted ’

and exactly proper thing, but when at

man has to suffer to comply with a -

foolish sentim.ent_it seems as if the
point was carried entirelny too far.
Why it is such an offensive thing to
see a man without his coat-we are‘
at a loss to discover. On the o-thed
hand it positively hinders am an do-

, ing his best work when he is compell- ‘

ed to sit for an hour in a stiﬂing room
with the added hindrafice of a heavy
coat. There might be some reason
fo"rthe objection if the shirts of Wash-

ington and Jefferson mer were habit-

ually in an ’unlaunderedl state but for
the most part it willbe found that the
shirts are not only clean but present
a most pleasing appearance‘ of well
blended colors, lending beauty to an

otherwise bromidic scene and satis-

fying the aesthetic tastes of the fas-
tidious. ‘

However, if these professors are
still set upon their students wearing
coats in class” room it has been sug-

gested that they install a few electric

fans, under which conditions the stu-
dents will be glad to strictly adhere
to this straight-backed. convention-
and come to college‘ each nice hot day‘
carefully swathed in well brushed and
suffocating coats.——Red and Black.

THE FACULTY’S RESPON-
SIBILITY IN UNIVERSI-
TY -TRAINING.

‘V In an editorial of several weeks ago,
we‘ commented upon the lackiof en-
thusiasm amon gstudents‘ of today for

7 ‘things of the mind. We have since

ventured to question how far the fac-
Vulties of our colleges and universities
and the prevailing methods of educa-
tion‘ they advocate and pursue, may
be responsible for this condition of
affairs. ,\Ve have‘frequ'ently been im-
pressed by the contrast between the
‘temper of the Freshman class, of the
second term that that of the same
classiin the ﬁrst; and by the contrast
between Sophomores and Freshmen. A
touch of apathy, of unwarranted self-
_ assurance, and of indifference ,to
standards ,of excellence becomes in-
creasingly perceptible in men'of six

, , months’ or a, year’s university stand-

iing, who"upon entering were moved
apparently by a genuine desire for

" ytheii greatest ‘possible self-improve-
 -ment. It has been the experience of

 - ;many a man to come to college eager-

.l\

1 1y seeking new-light upon the ques-
-,ti"ons of life, and anxious to be given
new outlooks and new ideals, only to
ﬁnd it necessary to make a complete

“re-adjustment, and ‘to understand the

 new order of things as best he may,

turns for help. This readjustment
-some men succeed in making; but

others, discouraged and wanting the

- .--direction of an older mind, fall into at

A ‘ mood of complaceny and indifference ‘i and of any one of the professions;

It ma ybe‘ said by some thai this

" experience also is a part of education;
’ . K *-

thata iiian’s faculties are sharpened
by hisiibeing compelled to help him-
lself;-and that the student, in the
courseiof a year’s college work, is rid

« ofa lot of junk in the shape of va-

rious sentimentalities and airy gener-
‘alizations about life Whichitiis en-
tirely desirable he should be rid of.

Granted that this is partly true. VVe

, still question, however, whether the

individual mind is- given enough atten-
tion; whether the average member of
the faculty, is sufficiently concerned
with preserving ideals while he modi-
ﬁes them. ,\/From the-faculty’s stand-
point, the problem of education, it
seems to us, resolves itself into two
considerations: the giving of sum-

‘ —-cient time to actual teaching, and the

possession of a culture broad enough

_g;and of an idealism strong enough to-

‘reach the human side of the student,
.and to compel not only his atte_ntioi‘1,

it is to -a high’ degree regrettable

that so much of a professor’s time is

develop that breadth _of 0 knowledge,
that instinct for the heroic, that

-man mind, which areireally humaniz-

idealism. And the student is given

' frequently, instead ofany new philos-

ophy of life_or a knowledge of the
