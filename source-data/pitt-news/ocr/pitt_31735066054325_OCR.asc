@pgh.cafe to bring together

students and company CEOs

Laura Golembiewski

NORTH OAKLAND  

For The Pitt News

’ Instead of standing nervously at
rows of booths where suited human
resources executives _ collect
resumes, students will be able to lis-
ten to music and wear their favorite

blue jeans to a job fair Tuesday while’

mingling with agents from top com-

panies.
The Pittsburgh Technology
Council will bring its unique

approach to job fairs to Pitt this week
with @pgh.cafe, pronounced “At
Pittsburgh Cafe.”

This event will give students and
faculty the opportunity to meet with
chief executive, technical and sci-
ence officers of technology-based
corporations located in Southwestern

Pennsylvania, such as Sony
Electronics, Texas Instruments and
Lycos.

@pgh.cafe will be a relaxed,

‘social setting in which informal

clothing ——including jeans —— is
encouraged. Computer science, engi-

l neering and business students can get

to know the heads of major corpora-
tions while listening to‘ music in a
less rigid environment. »

Students can visit @pgh.cafe
between 3 and 7 p.m Tuesday in the
William Pitt Union.

Visitors will have the opportuni-
ty to speakpersonally with company
representatives, who ‘will demon-
strate their technology and inform
students about current projects.

Students can also find out about
internship and career opportunities
with these corporations.

@pgh.cafe began in 1996 at
Carnegie Mellon University after a
focus group of students and faculty
decided that a more informal job fair
would be more successful than the
traditional suit—and-tie setting. In
1997, @pgh.cafe drew more than
500 students and faculty to its CMU
event. The Pittsburgh Technology
Council expects more than 700 to
attend Pitt’s @pgh.cafe. '

This event is part of the
Pittsburgh Technology Council’s

» Human Capital Initiative, a program
aimed at keeping in Pittsburgh the E.

talented people who graduate from
the area’s universities, in addition to

-attracting more of such talent from

other areas.

According to Dana Romano,
managing director of the Human
Capital Initiative, local technology
companies have many opportunities
for students, and the Pittsburgh
Technology Council helps to make
these opportunities known.

7‘Companies in Southwestern
Pennsylvania have work—force issues
and are very willing to work with
students,” said Romano. “The
Pittsburgh Technology Council helps
facilitate that.”

@pgh.cafe coming to Pitt can be

Council’s Web site at

SGB opens communication

between organizations -

Jason Galllnger

Assistant News Editor

A student government member said
he hopes a meeting held Thursday will
improve communication between stu-
dent groups at Pitt for years to come.

George Mongell, chairman of the
Academic Affairs Committee, said the
members of student governance groups
frequently don’t know the academic
issues in which other groups are
engaged.

“Communication amongst
groups is just pathetic,” he said.

Mongell asked 30 student organi-
zations —- from the Nursing Student
Association to the Black Action
Society — to attend the meeting. There
were three goals of the meeting: to
allow the groups to inform the
Academic Affairs Committee about
their projects, to allow the Academic
Affairs Committee to tell the groups
about its projects, and to brainstorm
ways for all parties to collaborate. .

The meeting date’ was set only a
week after Mongell e—mai1ed his initial
invitations; in the end, only about 10
people attended. Mongell said it was a
good start to an important process,
especially given the haste with which
the event was organized. /

“Getting representation from 10
groups is great,” he said. “Student
groups have a stronger voice collec-
tively.” ~ ,

Representatives from the
Engineering Student Council, the
Black Action Society, the Academic
Affairs Committee and two fraternities
attended.

Student Government“ Board
President Alyson Wallach and board
member Elizabeth ‘Klein were also pre-
sent. ,

“It’s easy for student government
to get caught up in CAS,” Wallach said
afterward. “This kind of meeting helps’
give SGB a global perspective on the
campus.”

Mongell said hehopes to have sim-
ilar meetings every two weeks. On
Sept. 22, SGB held a student assembly

the

meeting that also focused on improving‘

communication between student gover-
nance groups.

The bulk of the meeting focused on
discussion of Academic Affairs
Committee projects. ,

The committee has been working
on a system through which students can
get their grades over the telephone
three days after ﬁnal exams end, rather
than waiting for Pitt to mail a paper
copy. The system would save the
University an estimated $5,000 per
semester in reduced mailing ‘costs,
Mongell said, and allow students to
rely on themselves, rather than advis-

ers, to ﬁnd out their academic stand-

ings. 1

Because Computing and
Information Services has lost 14
employees in recent months and must
first complete a computer accounting
system mandated by the federal gov-
ernment, Mongell estimated that the

‘system will be ready by April.

The Academic Affairs Committee
is also involved in establishing a facul-
ty honor roll that Mongell said he wants
to see in place by the end of the semes-
ter. Student evaluations of their instruc-
tors would be published so “students

can see which professors and which —

departments are making an impact,”
Mongell said.

Wallach said the University has in
the past blocked publication of faculty
evaluations in an effort to avoid nega-
tive publicity. The current push for a
faculty honor roll would be a way of
“turning around” the situation, she said.

Other issues included making “A+”
grades count for more than four quality
points and introducing academic advis-
er evaluations.

“There’s a lot that we’re doing cur-
rently for the students here at the
University,” Mongell said.

He encouraged the assembled rep-
resentatives to discuss the issues with
their groups so the whole campus com-
munity could be better informed of
progress, and to bring feedback and
suggestions to future meetings.

“It’s really important for SGB to ‘

reach out and learn what everyone else
is thinking,” Klein said. 0

Students in Solidarity’s WPU
shenanigans very effective

Mimes, stiltwalkers, sun-
bathers, bellhops and workers: All
were out in 1890s garb to celebrate
the William Pitt Union’s 100th
anniversary Thursday.

Organizers of the event were,
however, not too glad to see the
students dressed as workers; they
belonged to Students in Solidarity
and were boycotting Nabisco in
response to its decision to shut
down its East Liberty plant in
November.

Whether one agrees with them
or not, their showing at the cele-
bration was nothing less than
effective. In terms of raising

awareness for their cause. Their

self—proclaimed “gue1illa theatre”
did wonders for them. Frombeing
a mere sidebar article, their organi-
zation became a high-proﬁle news
story by being kicked out of the
Union. ,

Were they out of order in using
a University celebration to pursue
their aim in publicizing the
Nabisco boycott? Maybe, though
one can’t help but draw parallels
with workers’ conditions in the
1890s.

If they had inﬁltrated the open-
ing party of the Schenley Hotel in
1898, needless to say, those ever-
so—nice people from the Pinkerton
Security Agency would have shot

them. The working man’s penetra-
tion of the governing force’s ban-
quet would have resulted in the
penetration of the worker’s skull '
by a nightstick.

Students in Solidarity were
kindly asked to vacate the premis-
es and continue their protest else-
where. No violence, but ‘like the
breakup of Carnegie Steelworkers
during the 1892 Homestead strike,
which resulted in 10 deaths, the
ghosts of the Pinkerton Security
Agency remain.

Unlike 1926, when construc-
tion of the Cathedral of Learning
began and Schenley Hotel patrons
were outraged that construction
workers were using the toilet facil-
ities (for one year, the restrooms at
the hotel were the only ones they
could use), workers can — rest
assured — use William Pitt Union
bathrooms, as long as they’re not

handing out anti-Nabisco ﬂiers.

- Some may agree that more

needs to be done in the struggle .

between the powers that be and the
working people, as Students in
Solidarity have said and tried to
illustrate with their protest.

Whether you want to join in
their protest or grind them into the
dirt, Students in Solidarity’s show-
ing at the celebration was nothing
short of successful.

'_TherearecertainthingsIseeasself—evi-
dent that may not seem to be so for many peo-
ple. Perhaps I can use an event that happened
this weekend to illustrate two seemingly dis-
parate examples of such truisms: (1) that “free
speech” does not exist in the United States, and
(2) that the working class has no country.

On Saturday, several members of Students
in Solidarity — including this writer —— joined
members of the Pittsburgh Labor Action
Network for the Americas in an anti-sweatshop
action at the Greensburg Wal-Mart. The event
was part of an ongoing “right to know” cam-
paign organized by the National Labor
Committee, the group famous for exposing
Kathie‘ Lee Gilford’s use of sweatshop labor.

The demands of the campaign are simple:
Corporations must make public the
list of ' factories producing their
goods around the world, they must
open these factories to independent
inspection by human-rights moni-
tors, they must pay a living wage,
and they must respect the right to organize. Wal-
Matt has refused to let the public know the loca-.
tions of the factories that produce its goods.

In illustration of point (1) above, it would
be a gross understatement to say that the tactics
available to us. were  Vlfrth Wal—Martsi
and malls nationally, store property extends to
the store, the storefront, the parking lot, and
often chunlm of the surrounding area. These

JOHN

companies prohibit leaﬂetting and will report to
t the police anyone who continues to leaﬂet when

asked to stop. Last year, several PLANTA
members deliberately courted arrest in
Monroeville in order to test these onerous
restrictions on freedom of expression. They lost
theircourtcasesandhadtopayﬁnes.Suchisthe

In spite of the fact thatWal-Marts, shopping

‘malls and the like are eﬂ"ect_ively public spaces,

their proprietors are able to keep dissidents from
questioning their policies. The result is the ﬂir-
ther atomization of an already-atomized society.

limit, however: We wore anti-Wal-Mart T-shirts
into the store and could get away with it on the
grounds that Wal-Mart was not excluding peo-
ple with other messages on their T-shirts (adver-
tisements, etc.) and therefore could not discrim-
inate based on the message. We were still not
allowed to approach people and give them
leaﬂets unless people approached us ﬁrst, which
—inthesedays ofatomization—isatallorder.

In any case, it’s important to note that we
were joined by local members of the
International Brotherhood of Painters and Allied
Trades. They were outraged that the Greensburg
Wal-Mart had recently been constructed with
non-union labor. They were also coming out to
confront Wal-Mart over its use of sweatshop
labor in making its products. I found this
encouraging. It is true that the con-
cept of international solidarity is far
from new to unions: The United
Electrical, Radio and Machine
Workers, for example, has a partner-
ship with an independent union in
Mexico. But the Electrical Workers union, hav-
ing been expelled from the Congress of
Industrial Organizations during the witch-hunt
years of the Cold War, is an organization with a
long—established left—wing tradition.

Craft unions like_ the IBPKI‘, on the other

hand, have often been stereotyped as myopic V‘

and conservative, and yet the members of this
local had no trouble understanding the idea of
solidarity across borders. After all, a corporation
ﬂrat makes use of child labor and sweatshops in
Pakistan, Mexico, Oman, China, Turkey and a
dozen other countries around the world — not
to mention non-union garment ‘manufacturers
hereintheUnitedStates—isnotgoingtobe
accommodating of workers’ rights in Western
Pemisylvania, either. All of which is a fairly neat
illustration of point (2) above.

As for Wal-Mart, the managers lmd few

Tm; Pm Naws: OPINIONS 7

  Everybody needs a
happy lillle friend  

Dave "Madden

Columnist

We live in a cruel, cruel world. It’s
ugly, dirty, smelly, noisy. People look
down while they walk. T'l1ere’s trash all
over the streets of Oakland. The
Backstreet Boys have taken America by
storm. What’s the point of even getting out
of bed? I

These are the crazy ideas that ﬁnd
their way into my head from time to time.

_ I try not to pay attention to them, but dur-

ing school or work or other various times
of difﬁculty, I ca_n’t help but entertain
them for a while.

I During an early morning of wretched-
ly boring classes, I remind myself that
‘The Joy of Painting” will be on soon and,
my mind will be cleansed of all its dirty
pessimism. ,

You all know the show, so don’t pre-
tend like you don’t. It’s the one in which
the guy with an Afro talks about happy lit-
tle trees . You may have seen him on an
MTV ad a few years back; his name was
Bob Ross, and I ﬁrmly believe he’s our
generation’s answer to_ Jesus Christ,
Buddha, David Koresh or whichever
name you’d like to ﬁll in here.

For those who are still pretending to
not know what I’m ‘talking about, the
show consists of Ross doing a complete
landscape painting in the span of 30 min-
utes. All the while, he narrates, describing
his steps with such innocent joy and won-
der that even though his mastery is clearly
impossible to match, it makes one believe
that he, too, can work a similar magic on
his canvas.

Ross’ techniques are just that: magic.
He’ll take a fan brush, rub it in the
Prussian blue and ibumt sienna for a bit,
tap it on the canvas, and — bam! — he’s’
got himself a remarkably beautiful, per-
fectly rendered pine tree. Or he’ll take his
painter’s knife, get a tiny roll of paint on
the tip, shake it across the canvas, and
instantly have a mountain.

_ But Ross’_magic lies not only within _
_his technique. I’m no painter, so just about
any sort of representational artwork looks

like magic to me. The title of the show is
apt; Ross’ discussion. and instruction dur-
ing the show are centered around one
idea: joy. There is an intense joy that can
only be brought about through painting,
and everything Ross says and does
emphasizes this point. That’s his real
magic. '

After every episode of “The Joy of
Painting,” I feel ready to run out, buy
some art supplies, and work some magic
of my own. More importantly, I feel fully
relaxed and calm and at peace with
myself, my world, and my brethren. Every
aspect of the show -— from Ross’ soothing

voice to the warm tones of the canvas — V

blend together as a sort of televisual nar-
cotic that, frankly, I’m hooked on.

My first meaningful run—in with
Ross’ show was a few years ago during a
most stressful and tense day, the details of
which I won’t bother getting ir1to. To calm
my nerves, I —— as usual — sat myself in
front of the Television and tried as best as
I could to stop all thought. Endless chan-
nel-ﬂipping was not working. Then I land-
ed» on my local PBS charmel down home.
“Oh, that funny guy with the hair,” I
thought; In 15 minutes, I fell into one of

my all—time greatest naps of recent mem— -

ory.

Needless to-say, I’ve been a big fan
since then, and through the years, I have
learned that the show is even more enjoy-
able if I stay awake through the ‘whole
thing and then fall asleep. The problem
with PBS, however, is its erratic program-

ming habits. After getting acquainted with

it down home, I came up here and could-

n’t find the show. Finally, by the end of _

my freshman year, I ‘had the 2 p.m.
Monday time slot memorized.

Around the same time, I heard some
exciting and horrible news. The exciting
part was the fact that Ross is from the
town next from mine, a fact that made me
feel even closer to my tele-savior than
ever before. The terrible part was the fact
that he had died sometime in the early
‘90s, and my weekly healing would only
be able to take place through the transmis-
sion of reruns. I

Then, to add to the turmoil, this sum-
mer Ross wasn’t on one week or the next
week or the next. PBS had replaced him in
that time slot with “Sit and Be Fit,” a hor-
ribly useless show with some grandma in
a chair shrugging her shoulders and call-
ing it exercise. It was, in itself, infuriating.
This, coupled with a lack of Ross’s magic
to soothe me, drove me to near-insanity
throughout the summer. I

A few weeks ago, I found him again,
hiding on Thursdays —— same happy little
time, same happy little charmel. As a pro-
tective measure against this sort of thing
happening again, or in the event’that I’ll
be out of town for an extended period of
time over a Thursday, I’ve begun a tape of
“The Joy of Painting.”

Also, in case I get pessimistic‘ and. _

angry and stupid right after the weekend, I
can shut myself in my house, pop in Ross,
and feel once again at peace with myself,
my world and my brethren.

So please, ﬁnd time every Thursday
at 2 p.m. to sit down, tune to WQED, and

regain faith in society and television. After —

all, neitherof the two can be all that bad if
the magic of Bob Ross came from them.

Dave Madden’s favorite spot on the FM
dial is the constantly rockingsounds of

. dead air he experiences only from WPTS.

‘ Senior Football Wrlter

Walt Harris walked‘, into Saturday’s
postgarne press conference soaking wet.

Foggy glasses hid his eyes from the
cameras as water dripped off his wind-
breaker, practically . forming ice crystals
along his sleeves. ‘

He sat down and said simply, “What a
beautiful day.”

Harris’ Panther team shut out the
Akron Zips, 35-0, in the middle of the
year’s coldest downpour, relying on Latef
Grirn’s three touchdown receptions for the
offense and a mix of slippery turf and bone-
janing tackles for the team’s ﬁrst shutout in
over a decade.

V The win was “going to give the coach-
ing staff —— all the way through the equip-

ment manager — conﬁdence,” according ‘

to Pitt quarterback Matt Lytle.

Lytle’s conﬁdence in particular will be
boosted with his 12—of-17 passing perfor-
mance, including four touchdowns. H e
and the dominant Panther line combined
for a 62-yard scoring drive on Pitt’s ﬁrst
possession, starting with a 12-yard quarter-
back draw through a gaping hole in the cen-
ter of the ﬁeld Five plays later, Lytle tossed
a 12-yard touchdown to Grim, who evaded
comerback Jerome Cargile in the end zone.

“Latef has stepped it up,” Lytle said
“He’s outstanding. I love it.”

Grim went scoreless for the rest of the
ﬁrst quarter, as did his teammates. The

Panthers fumbled on the ﬁrst play of each
of their next two possessions —— ﬁrst a
botched pitch from Lytle to Rickey
Mendenhall, then a fumble by rtmning
back -Ike Wﬂliarns.

\ It was one of six Pitt fumbles in the
game — three were recovered by Akron,
which added two interceptions in the con-
t6St.

Harris acknowledged the errors, say-
ing that his team was “capable of clearing
up those things.” _

And he added, “Our defense was able
-to overcome it.” '

On Akron’s ﬁrst drive of the second
quarter, Pitt’s defense overcame pretty
much everything. A ﬁrst—down nm by
Mike Lagasse netted 3 yards before Amir
Purifoy — making his ﬁrst collegiate start
at linebacker — steamrolled a potential
blocker and threw the Zip to the wet car-
pet.

On second down, Julian Graham
sacked Akron’s James Washington fora
10-yard loss. On ‘third down, not wanting
to be outdone by his linemate, Kenny
Pegram dropped Washington for another
10 yards. .

Facingrfourth-and—27, the Zips punt-
ed, and the Panthers rattled off a 60-yard
scoring drive to push their lead to 14-0.

The Panther defense wasn’t ﬁnished
Washington rolled out under pressure on
the Zips’ next possession, then tossed a
wobbling pass right to Pitt’s Seth

Tl-IE PITT NEWS

A win makes everybody feel better  

Players don’t always smile after a win.

Ifthe team has made grievous mistakes
on the way to a_ victory, however large,
team members often sulk after the ﬁnal
gun, knowing full well that only a stroke of
luck or an abundance of God-given talent
helped the team overcome itself.

Then again, sometimes the excitement
following a blowout win just overcomes a
player, especially if the
player has performed well
beyond expectations. ' '

For instance, after Pete
Gonzalez rewrote ‘the Pitt H
record book with 470 yards E
of total offense against 
Rutgers last year, his smile 
could be seen throughout 
much of New Jersey.

He was so happy that
he forgot to censor himself
while talking to the press,
letting loose the revelation
that he was anxious to get
back to Pittsburgh to be
with his girlfriend.

Er, watch ﬁlms. Yeah.
That’s what he meant to say, he said.

Good games do that to players.

So after Pitt’s 35-0 demolition of
Akron on Saturday, Seth Homack, in his

jubilation, “recounted a sequence where Zip .-
quarterback James “Butchie” Washington

 

knew there was trouble:

Thanks to impressive ﬁlm study by
defensive coordinator Larry Coyer and
other Pitt coaches, Homack and his team-
mates could tell that Washington was about
to run the option. ‘

As they screamed to each other that the
option was coming, Washington’s eyes
began to bulge. Instead of calling an audi-



ble or changing the formation or calling a
timeout or simply throwing his hands up in
the air (‘ ‘Coach, they know what’s coming!
They must have_ ESPNI”), Washington
stayed behind center, determined.

“Then he ran it and just got killed,”

Kenny Pegram drags down Akron quarterback James Washington.

said Homack, eagerlydescribing the scene
to the press like a 6-year-old discussing the
most recent episode of “Freakazoid” with a
playmate.

As he talked, Matt Lyﬂe and Ethan
Weidle listened intently.

During Saturday’s contest, both "Lytle
and Weidle beneﬁted immensely from the
play of Homack and his defensive counter-
parts. Not only did the

Akron territory for much of
the game, they also helped
cover for ﬁve . offensive
turnovers.

After Saturday’s contest,
Lytle and Weidle sat next to
Homack as he told his story,
attempting to pay close, seri-
ous attention to the 5-foot-10-

not to jump outof his skin.

On the “just got kill ”
line, though, they lost it.
Weidle, who protected his
quarterback all afternoon (for
the ﬁrst time all season, one
could add), caught Lytle’s head just before
it hit the table as the signal-caller doubled
over in a ﬁt of near—hysteria.

Flash back to the Penn State game, and
Lytle would be trying to remember what
planet he was on.

Laughter wasn’t an option then;
breathing was tough enough.

Wins of any sort make a world of dif-
ference. Big wins can boost a team’s conﬁ-
dence immensely.

Really, really big wins, especially those
that feature a shutout, can turn a season.
And as long as the team’s attitude stays this
good, anything could happen. Including a
‘win against North Carolina on Saturday.

Head coach Walt Harris put it best:
“They will be much more coachable and
much more alert and much more conﬁdent
when we play better.”

Other than the nagging fumbles, the

Panthers couldn’t have played much better .

on Saturday.’ Harris practically said as much
after the contest, praising the defense, the
offense, and even Chris Ferencik — the
award-winning “kicker—tumed-backup-
turned-starter as of the Akron game.

Of course, he did all of this before
telling a joke about his wife making fun of

him for watching too much football on tele- _

vision.
After wins like Saturday’s, even the
coach is allowed to have a little ﬁm. ‘

Homack, who caught it at the Akron 36-yard
line.

Four plays later, Lytle found someone
other than Grim in the end zone —— returning
wideout Terry Murphy, who hauled in a 25-
yard touchdown pass. _.

It was one of two Murphy catches on
the day — the senior didn’t start due to a
nagging ankle injury and saw limited
action.

“Hopefully, we got him out of there
before his leg gets any more injured than it
is,” Hanis said . _

While the defense pounded on the Zips
— Akron ﬁnished with 97 yards of total
offense —— the Pitt offense switched from the
air attack to the ground game. Kevan
Barlow and both the Wrlliamses — Brandon
and Ike — saw action at nmning back, but
the fullback tandem of Mendenhall and
Matt Moothart drew ‘most of Harris’ atten-
tion.

FROM PAGE 8

Moothart, a redshirt ﬁeshman from

Waterloo, Iowa, carried four times for 10
yards. Mendenhall carried eight times,
including an 11-yard fullback draw that
resulted in Pitt’s fourth touchdown.

Barlow led all tailbacks with 57 yards,
but Harris made it known that the position
remains far from ﬁlled

“We’re looking for the guy that we can
give the ball to play after play,” said the
coach. “Right now, that person’s not there.”

Barlow rushed for 37 of his yards in
Pitt’s last major offensive effort — a 13—play,

' 98-yard drive that resulted in the Panthers’ .
last score of the game. Lytle hit Grim with a

4—yard score on the 13th play and went
three-and-out on his next possession before
giving way to backup Matt O’Connor.

Grim complimented the starter on his
208—yard perfonnance but put most of his
praise on the Pit offensive line.

“When we get the time, it’s obvious
what we can do,” said Grim.

He didn’t agree with his coach’s assess-
ment of the day, however.

“It’s col ” said the San Joaquin Delta
College transfer. “It’s not like California.”

 FROM PAGE 8

Julian Graham and tackle Kenny Pegram

Akron’s woes were far from over as its
next drive was ended after only one play,
with an interception by Homack The ﬁnal
two Zip possessions of the half ended in
punts. I

As play began in the second half, the
Zips may have been cursing their choice to
defer as Phil Clarke stopped I_.omax for a

‘loss

and Demond Gibson stripped
Washington of the ball on the next play.

After a rest due to an extended scoring
drive by the offense, the defense again hur-
ried a Zip offensive series with solid pass
coverage and another sack for a loss by
Kody Miller. - ’

As the fourth quarter began, Akron’s
offense began to show the effects of Pitt’s
defensive onslaught.

“We’re playing against 300—pounders,
and they get tired,” said Simonian.

 FROM PAGE 8

Lytle and his line have not had the best

- relationship this year on the ﬁeld. The line

has not givenits quarterback the time he
needs to throw the ball. Penn State dropped
Lytle eight times, and then Virginia Tech
had nine sacks against the Panthers.

Saturday, the line gave its quarterback
plenty of time to throw, and Latef Grim,
one of Lytle’s receivers, said that the fans
saw what Lytle can do when he gets time.

Akron’s two sacks only set the Pitt
offense back 11 yards. Lytle had time to
throw ﬁve touchdown passes.

Harris and his coaching staff made a
few changes to the offensive line this
week, and they seemed to help‘. Ethan
Weidle moved from right guard to right
tackle. Justin Wade moved from backup
center to right guard to start the game.

The shake-up gave the line a wake-up
call and improved its performance.

Weidle, for one, moved between guard .

and tackle a great deal throughout the day
and received praise from his quarterback
for the outstanding job he did.

“Ethan [Weidle] did a of a job moving
around. That’s a tough thing to do,” Lytle
said.

. __Weid_Ie had to not only remember the
play he was rtmning, but also remember
the position he was playing —— guards and

tackles have different assignments on each
play, so he had to adapt his blocking tech-
nique to ﬁt his position.

Last week, after "the Virginia Tech
game, the offensive line had a meeting in
the middle of the ﬁeld at Pitt Stadium as
soon as line got off the bus, according to
Weidle. .

“We didn’t want to let the proud tradi-

P tion of otfensive linemen at this school go

away,” Weidle said.
This game also gave the line a chance
to see what some of the backups can do.
“We got alot of people rotating into
the game. Someof the new guys and some

' of the young guys got to play,” Weidle said.

“We will needxthose guys down the
stretch,” Lytle said.

The inexperience of the offensive line
has been one of the biggest problems all

year. Four starters on last year’s line grad- .

uated, so this year’s line had to ﬁll those
holes. I
The line also did some run blocking
Saturday by getting the backs 172 yards
rushing to go along with 208 yards pass-
mg. _
Lytle will be a little happier in practice
this week since he did not go home in a
haze Saturday night. He will look for his
line to turn in the same performance next
week at North Carolina, when he will need
to stay on his feet to help the Panthers jump
over the .500 mark.
