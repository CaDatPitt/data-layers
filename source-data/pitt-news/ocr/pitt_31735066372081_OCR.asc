Employment vital

By Nancy Quick"
Staff Writer

A woman’s role in society has
transcended the traditional patterns
of the 1950s and now includes full-
time employment, according to pro-
fessor Irene Frieze. For the
contemporary woman, some kind of
employment is probably needed to
maintainher good mental health.

“It has become the exception, not
the rule,” Frieze said, “for a woman
to remain a full-time housewife after
marriage.”

Statistics show that as long ago as
1979, 7l.5 percent of women
between the ages of 20 and 24 held

. full-timejobs, as did 63.3 percent of
women between the ages of 25 and
34. Another study shows that in
1980, over 50 percent of women with
children under 18 years of agewere
employed full-time, compared with
only 9 percent in 1940. Frieze
addressed the probable causes of
this trend.

“It is true that modern technology
has given today’s housewife more
leisure time, and statistics show that
women are having fewer children,”
she said, “but one of the strongest
reasons that we see more married

women choosing full-time careers.

lies in a woman’s psychological mo-
tivation and need for success.”

According to Frieze, basic needs
for financial security, achievement,
affiliation, help and independence
are fulfilled better in the employed
woman than in the homemaker.

“The need for achievement, for
example, is fulfilled in the workplace
through objective feedback from
superiors and co-workers,” Frieze
said. “The homemaker receives an
evaluation of her efforts in a much
more subjective way from her family
members. She faces the frustration
of having to satisfy her achievement
needs through those who,may often
take her for granted.”

Frieze also stressed the impor-

to female health

tanceof affiliation for women today.
These needs are well-satisfied in the
workplace, where co-workers and
clients provide cooperation and
companionship.

“In contrast, the homemaker
must rely on her children, who oper-
ate on a different level than she does,
and her neighbors, who cannot
always be depended upon,” she said.
“And with more married women
working, the woman who chooses to

be a homemaker may find herself ’

one of the only women in her neigh-
borhood at home during the day.”

Frieze also focused on the kinds of
jobs that women choose as opposed
to those that men choose. The most
outstanding difference, according to
Frieze, can be seen in job focus.
Women tend to choosejobs that are
more people-oriented — jobs
through which they gain a high
potential for making animpact on a
few people. Frieze found mento be
generally more thing-oriented,
choosingjobs that allow them to use
their work skills to have an impact
on many people.

“The medical profession is a clear
example of the difference that

women seem to be making in the.

work force,” she said. “The number
of clinics and counseling centers ‘run
by women professionals show a defi-
nite trend toward more personalized
medical care.”

Frieze cited statistics that show
incidence of depression to\be almost
two times higher in women than in
men. Anxiety and prescriptive psy-
choactive drug use are also higher in
women than in men. Other studies
have shown that employed women
tend‘ to be in better physical health
than women who choose not to
work.

“Changing roles of women today
have created new needs,” Frieze
said, “so that some kind of outside
employment has become not only
preferred but necessary for a wom-
an’s emotional health.”

Pitt, CMU to share   a
NASA supercomputer

By John Zaphyr
Staff Writer

The National Science Foundation
announced last Thursday that the
University of Pittsburgh and
Carnegie-Mellon University will
receive a CRAY l-S supercomputer
from NASA’s Lewis Research Cen-
ter in Cleveland later this year.

This grant results from the efforts
of CMU, Pitt and Westinghouse
Electric Corporation to enhance the
supercomputing facilities available
to the academic and industrial com-
munities in Pittsburgh. Four. other
universities had been previously
selected as sites — Princeton, Cor-
nell, the University of California at
San Deigo (UCSD) and the Univer-
sity of Illinois. Finally, after an
eight-month negotiating period, Pitt
and CMU joined that group but the
talks have not stopped. Representa-
tives of this consortium say they are
optimistic that support from the
NSF, state and local government
and local industry will enable con-
tinued improvement of the facility.

“This is not the end of our negoti-
ations,” said Michael Levine, pro-
fessor of physics at C MU and one of
the principle investigators in the
supercomputing effort. “The local
press has stressed that the equip-
ment we received was the final pro-
duct, but we will continue to
upgrade the system in the future.”

The computer represents a signifi-
cant addition to the computing
efforts at both Pitt and CMU
because it is at least 10 times faster
than any computer at either campus.

“Scientists believe that supercom-

' puters are the only feasible way of

tackling complex problems that
require billions ofcalculations to

solve —- problems such as weather
forecasting, aircraft and automobile

design, drug design, molecular biol- '

ogy and quantum chemistry,” said
Ralph Roskies, professor of physics
at Pitt and another of the principles
in the effort. “The grant will make
possible research into improving the
performance of supercomputers
themselves through better software
and improved supercomputer
design.” .

University officials and political
leaders said the grant strengthens
Pittsburgh’s research climate and its
position as a leading center for com-
puter expertise and will enhance
prospects for high-tech economic
development.

Wesley Posvar,» president of the
University of Pittsburgh, said the
presence of the supercomputer in
Pittsburgh “is another element in the
transformation of the city ‘and the
region into a center for advanced
research and development. There
will be an increased synergistic effect
among the universities, high-
technology businesses and other
research organizations because of
the availability of the supercomput-
er and the associated expertise.”

Pittsburgh Mayor Richard Cali-
guiri hailed the grant as a boost for
the city's economic recovery. “The
supercomputer center will not only
benefit Pitt, CMU and Westing-
house in their research efforts, but
will also act as a high-tech magnet to
‘attract those businesses which can
make use of the center’s computing

expertise,” he said. “The center’s

location here is a most important
contribution to the development of
Pittsburgh’s high-tech, , high-growth
business climate."

Supercomputers are the fastest,
most powerful and most expensive

computers available. They can per-
form at least 20 million arithmetic
operations per second by perform-
ing several calculations at once. At
peak operating speeds, the CRAY
l-S canperform up to 160» million
operations per second. Conven-

tional computers perform calcula- ‘

tions one at a time and this is a big
disadvantage _when attempting to
solve complicated calculations

“The United States can-
not expect to retain its
leadership in computing
and other high-tech areas if
we do not provide our stu-
dents and researchers with
the tools needed to get the

job done.”

-—Doug Walgren,
U. S. Representative

involved in scientific computing —~
where the speed and power that only
a supercomputer can handle are
essential.

The CRAY I-S will be operated
by the Westinghouse Energy Sys-
tems Computer’Center in Monroe-
ville under the supervision of James
Kasdorf. Westinghouse welcomes
the establishment of the center.

“Westinghouse is very pleased to
participate with Pitt and CMU in
establishingta supercomputer center
for the advancement of engineering
and science,” said Douglas D. Dan-
forth, chairman and chief executive

“Even though there have been
some rains, in the draught-
stricken areas, it will be about
one year‘ before the crisis can be
thought to be over in Ethiopia,”
stated Mark L. Edelman, a
senior coordinator of U.S. for-
eign aid for Africa.

Edelman was the keynote

Pittsburgh’s seventh annual
Francophone Development
Management seminar last Wed-
nesday at the‘William Pitt Union
Ballroom.

In attendance were 105 senior
officials from 19 African coun-
tries representing Algeria, Tuni-
sia, Morocco, Senegal, Mali,

_Niger, Chad, Cameroon, Zaire
and the Central African
Republic.

Edelman went on to say that
even though some conditions
were improving in Ethiopia,
other African countries (Chad
and Sudan in particular) are still
facing famine conditions.

Although Ethiopia has
received the most publicity, the

speaker at the opening session of «

African famine continues
despite American aid efforts

country of Sudan is also facing
catastrophe. Of the 20 million
people who live there, ll million

, are at risk of starvation and
disease.

On the effect of the draught on "

the population of Ethiopia, Edel-
man said: “I don’t know how
many people have died because
of the draught. The exact popu-
lation of Ethiopia is not known;
however, it is believed that there
are 42 million people who live
there at this time. Of those 42
million people, 7 million are at
risk.”

To help the countries in need,
the U.S. has been giving emer-
gency food aid to the areas most
affected by the draught. In this
fiscal year which began in
October, the U.S. sent approxi-
mately 1.8 million metric tons of
food valued at almost $730
million.

According to Edelman, the
official relationship between
Ethiopia and the U.S. is consi-
dered rocky at best due to Ethio-
pia’s ,Marxist government.
Because of this, distribution of
food is difficult, but the United
Nations and other agencies help
monitor the situation.

When asked if the supplies are

reaching their destination, Edel-
man replied that “despite some
problems, there are no reported
stories of supplies going astray.”

In addition to the money given
by the government, the people of
the U.S. have given $120 million
for famine relief. This is not
including aid from other nations,
but Edelman said that all aid was
welcome because “most under-
developed countries are in
Africa."

In the past,-Edelman said that‘
most developmental aid to
Africa was bungled. “Roads
were built that go nowhere. Hos-
pitals were constructed but they
had no staff. The government of
those nations could not affordto
pay to keep up the roads and
schools, and they were left to fall
in a state of decline.”

Edelman believes manage-
ment training is essential for the
future of Francophone Africa.
The problems in the past were
due to a lack of human resource
development. Edelman said he
was pleased that the University
of Pittsburgh is one of the only
institutions of higher learning in
the U.S. to have management
training for the Francophone
countries.

It’s 3:30 in the afternoon. In the

urer of the station but who is a DJ as

to the station.

WYEP President Peter Rosen-
field said he is optimistic about the
station. He said the station’s goals
for the future are “more public PTO‘
gramming and a better location for
WYEP studios.”

The studio, currently located at 4
Cable Place in Oakland, is presently
in a state of disrepair. The dilapi-
dated building, in its past, was a
motorcycle repair shop and was
later transformed into the radio sta-
tion in 1974, the first year of the
station’s existence."

The station recently purchased
new equipment with a grant from
the federal government. However,
the equipment waits in storage until
a new studio location can be‘ found.

Rosenfield, in his search fora new
location, is making economic con-
siderations a priority. “We cannot
afford to pay too much because,
being a public radio station, we
don't have too much money.".

The conditions ofthe building can
make life a little unpleasant for the
DJs. “The reason why it’s so musty
in here is because the roof leaks,”
Smith explained before going on the
air.

Despite the conditions of the stu-
dio, it serves as a valuable training
ground as it gives Smith the oppor-
tunity to sharpen her skills as a disc
jockey. WYEP’s chief attraction is
that it gives the discjockeys a chance

, to gain experience at their craft, and

at the same time, when the audience
tunes to 91.5 FM, they get to hear
something that’s not mainstream
pop.

It is time to introduce the next set
of songs, and Smith does so with the
poise and ease ofa professional. She
serves as a link between the com-
munity and the station, bringing the
two together.

As the records play, Smith takes
another request from the phone line,
making the time spent there worth-
while. The community is listening.

The supercomputer will be linked

researchers at CMU and Pitt to
develop and pursue new research
projects, primarily in science and
engineering. Students will be trained
in supercomputing techniques and
supercomputers will be integrated

imperative that a center for super-

Health fees raised

20% by trustees

By Jon Williams
Staff Writer

The University of Pittsburgh
board of trustees has passed a pro-
posal to increase the student health
fee by 20 percent.

According to Franklin W. Carter,
director of the Student Health Ser-
vice, “The old health fee can’t cover
expenses now. We haven’t had a fee
increase since I982. The cost of busi-
ness increases each year, so we
needed that raise.”

The Student Health Service, a
division of the Office of Student
Affairs, is designed to treat Pitt stu-
dents with minor injuries or
illnesses. The service is provided to
all students at Pitt who pay the fee
along with each term’s tuition.
Under the program, students are
able to seek medical attention at the
office (located in 204 Brackenridge
Hall) without added cost for service.

“When a student comes into [the
Health Service office],” Carter said,
“we are able to refer them to in-
house consultants. These are family
practitioners and nurse practitioners
that we have come in. If they see a
problem and if it's something we
can’t handle, the student is referred
to our specialists.”

Carter said the service has doctors
specializing in gynecology, internal
medicine, dermatology and minor
surgery.

All services are provided under
the initial health fee. Other special-
ized services are available through
referrals at reduced rates.

Carter said that current figures
show 75 percent of the total health
service budget pays for salaries and
fringe benefits for employees. Cur-
rently, there are 25 full-time and I6
part-time employees. Most of the
part-time employees are the special-
ists who are available to students.

Carter added that Pitt’s location
to the hospitals “is ideal for training
personnel for our special programs.”
The service trains students to help in
the centers.

“In addition,” Carter said, “we’re
able to bring our doctors and nurses
up—to-date with their skills from
time to time by sending them to spe-
cial programs at Duquesne and
Carlow.”

Carter said the personnel help
keep Pitt’s health service fees lower
than most schools. He also said the
increase will eliminate the need for
another increase for at least two
years.

Carter also said that he informed
the president of student government
and the president of the graduate
school’s student government before
making the proposal. The rate will
increase from $30 to $36. I

Rape. It’s the nation‘s most
underreported crime  the
nation’s most misunderstood
crime  and before the concen-
trated consciousness-raising
efforts of the women’s liberation
movement in the last decade, it
was the nation’s most ignored
crime.

With the recent publicity of
the Cathleen Webb rape recanta-
tion and public concern with
false rape charges, the validity of
rape accusations has again come
under the scrutiny of the public
eye. In some cities , the result has
been a delay in the already slow
success in rape prosecution and
progress. In Pittsburgh the anti-
rape network is stronger than
ever before.

“Allegheny County is a model
for what is going on in other
communities with rape pro-
gress,” said Mary Alice Babusci,
executive director of the Center
for Victims of Violent Crimes.
The center treated 297 rape vic-
tims alone, in I984. Its sister
organization, Pittsburgh Action
Against Rape, which counseled
1,299 victims in 1984, provides a

24-hour hotline as well as legal

Allegheny _County cooperat
rape as anti-rape network thrives

“Society tends to blame the victim for the rape. The
jury looks at her and decides if they approve of her rather

than saying, ‘Is this the person that did it?’ ”

-- Asst. District Attorney Janet Necessary

and medical advocacy of victims
of sexual assault. Allegheny
County’s progress lies in the
sophistication of the rape com-
munication network.

“Our referral system and our
networking gives us an advan-
tage," said Susan Domospoy, the
assistant director of the Center
for Victims of Violent Crimes.
“We have an excellent relation-
ship with the Pittsburgh police
and with the hospitals."

Rape crisis centers, such as
Victims of Violent Crimes and
PAAR, have established a rela-
tionship in which they work
along side of the police and the
hospitals in a relationship that
“helps the victim to understand
the system,” as Babusci said.

“We’re there if they need us,
but only if they request a repre-
sentative,” said Carolyn Frank,

4 the education specialist at the
Center for Victims. “We want to

give the victim the opportunity -

to make decisions. They begin
thinking again, which puts the

control that was taken away
from them through the rape back
into their hands.”

The Center for Victims, which
deals mostly with rape victims,
receives 56 percent of its referrals
from the police.

“The rape crisis centers are the
first places we call in a rape case,"
said Officer Gus Spruill, who’s
spent I8 years on the East Lib-
erty police force. “We welcome
working alongside of them. They
help us win our case.”

In many cities the insensitivity
of the police toward rape victims
has discouraged the reporting of
the crime. According to Assist-
ant Attorney General Lois H.
Herrington, about half ofthe 1.5
million rapes estimated to have
occurred in the last decade were

not reported to the police

because the victims did not want
to become “entangled in the
morass of an insensitive criminal
justice system” in which they
“fear nothing can be done." But,
according to Spruill, this isn't the

es against

case in Pittsburgh.

“When I began my involve-
ment on the police force, a
woman who was raped was taken
to the police station or to her
home, and then we tried to separ-
ate her from her mother and
father, so we could talk to her.
But, a lot of the victims didn’t
want us [male police] to talk to
her or touch her and we didn’t
have any female police officers
then,” said Spruill, “Now when
something happens we have the
rape crisis centers. This way the
victim is relaxed and ready to go
through the system.”

Advancements made in Pitts-
burgh hospitals have also aided
in assuaging the sense of futility
surrounding rape, not only in
their cooperation with the rape
crisis centers, but in the increas-
ing efficiency of the collection of
rape evidence.

In New York City and Ch-i-i

cago hospitals, a package known
as the Vitullo rape evidence kit is
used in every hospital on 90 per-
cent of the rape victims and has
proven instrumental in the
prosecution of rape cases,

“It provides a vindication of
sorts,” said Marty Goddard, the
executive director of Chicago’s
Committee for Victim ‘Assist-

“It provides a vindication of
sorts,” said Marty Goddard, the
executive director of Chicago’s
Committee for Victim Assistance.
“There is something there to back up
the victim's story  hair, semen,
blood.”

In Pittsburgh a similar sex crime
kit is used, a kit containing cotton

, swabs and slides for tissue samples
and fingernail scrapings, and combs
to gather hair and fiber samples
from the victims’ clothes. According
to Linda Brown, the emergency unit
director at Shadyside Hospital, the
kit has been used for the last l0 years
and is used on every rape victim
admitted into the center.

While the police force, hospitals
and crisis centers have made signifi-
cant advancements in the last
decade, according to assistant DA
and supervisor of the Crimes
Against the Person Unit of the dis-
trict _attorney’s office Janet Neces-
sary, the courts have made few of the
same changes.

Even in an age when women are
supposed to face fewer constraints

“We deal with myths when we are
trying to convince a jury,” said
Necessary. “Society. tends to blame
the victim for the rape. The jury
looks at her and decides if they
approve of her rather than saying,
“Is this the person that did it?"

“They blame the victim for put-
ting herself in the position where she
can get raped. She may be foolish or
even stupid, but that doesn’t give the
other person the right to be
acquitted.” 0

According to a new study con-
ducted by the University of Michi-
gan sociology professor Barbara F.
Reskin for the National Institute of
Mental Health, whenjurors render a
verdict in a rape trial, they often do
so on the basis of the victim’s de-
meanor and reputation, social life
and appearance.

“If the case does come to court,
the jurors are as likely to be influ-
enced by the behavior of the victim
as by the factors of the assault,” said
Ruskin.

The behavior patterns most
harshly judged by jurors include
drinking,
keeping late hours and going to bars
— all of which perpetuate the myth
that women should stay at home and
be wives and mothers. Many of the
jurors interviewed for the study were
even quoted as saying, “I know I’m
not supposed to be judgemental, but

the use of marijuana,_

These same rape myths extend ’

beyond the courtroom and into the
psychological aftereffects of the
victims.

“All of us on some level still hold
onto the myths (every woman wants
to be raped, rapes happen in dark
alleys to morally poor women, etc.).
It’s important to believe that they
are true, because if you then send
your daughter out at 7 a.m. in a
turtle neck and knee socks, you can
feel safe,” said Dr. Ellen Frank of
Western Psychiatric Institute. She is
currently conducting a project
involving 200 women and the psy-
chological effects of rape and cogni-
tive therapy.

“But when the rape myths are
turned around, they become
extremely dangerous to the victim,”

said Frank. “You think, ifl were '

raped, I must have wanted it.”

Although it has undergone con-
stant criticism as denying the
defendant's rights, the Rape Shield
Law remains the only legal defense
against a judicial system that oper-
ates on myths. The law, effective in
40 states, prohibits a woman’s past
sexual history from being reviewed
in the trial. But according to Neces-
sary, this protection is not always
useful.

“Defense lawyers always manage
to get around the law,” said Neces-
sary. “Even by asking questions that
imply a victim’s past histroy, they
plant the idea in the jurors’ minds.”

In the May rape trial of the Du-
s_quesne University basketball play-
ers, for example, the victim’s past
history was brought into the testi-
mony. The defense called a black
man to testify he had dated the
woman who is white.

“It perpetuated the myth that if
you do certain things, you’re not a
good girl and you deserve to be
raped,” said the plaintiff.

Another aspect of thejustice sys-
tem that works against the rape vic-
tim is the fact that the defendant is
often familiar with the system.

“I’ve looked at the same defen-
dant four and ﬁve times," said
Carolyn Frank. “He’s been there
before,” said Spruill. “When he
comes into that courtroom he looks
like the alI—American boy.”

In her national survey of jurors,
Dr. Ruskin cited that more often
than any other statement, she has
heard, “But he doesn’t look like a
rapist.”

With the recent publicity of the
rape recantation trial of Cathleen
Webb and Gary Dotson (who spent
six years in prison because ofa con-
viction for a rape that supposedly
never occured), Janet Necessary
believes that this trial will and
already has had a negative impact on
jurors’ decisions.

“Now every time they try a case,
thejury is going to say, ‘Are we mak-
ing a mistake? Is she lying?‘ It brings
back all the old myths.”

Reader confused

In his letter of May 29, Kevin
Bold writes that no one wants a
nuclear war, but people outside the
peace movement “just don’t think a
pre-emptive surrender will prevent"
one.” No significant fraction of
peace movement people have any
such thing in mind; arms control and
disarmament need not be unilateral
or unbalanced. To take issue with
our current administration’s obses-
sion with military solutions of politi-
cal problems is not remotely the
same as unilaterally abolishingiour
defense forces.

As Roger Molander has put it,
our policy makers are not likely
sources of change but they definitely
are potential agents of change.
Either the Soviet Union or the U-
nited States must curtail the heated
rhetoric and initiate alternative
methods of settling or tolerating our
many disputes and differences. The
U.S. peace movement has access to
U.S. policy makers, not to their
Soviet Union counterparts. Thus
they urge change upon those whom
they can reasonably hope to
inﬂuence.

Finally, the numbers game which
is played annually at budget time by
the Pentagon —~ the Russians are
coming again and the U.S. is a pit-
iful, weak giant. Surprisingly, how-
ever, out to‘p military brass
repeatedly notes that it would not
exchange our military capability for
that of the Soviet Union. Also, the
use of numbers for comparing
strengths long ago lost its meaning
in the strategic realm, once a thres-
hold of 300 or 400 nuclear warheads
was reached.

It is those who hold war-game
winning nuclear scenarios who are
naive. They have abandoned
rational definitions of win and lose
— they still think that one can win in
the same sense that we won World

War II. But things have changed —

Opinions

now — winning is much like losing.
Indeed everyone loses. Peace move-
ment people want governments —
all governments — to devise and
then adopt those new policies that
these changes require.

Nuclear naivete

Molly Rush’s comments regard-
ing the Strategic Defense Initiative
are inaccurate, assertive and an
unseemly form of demagoguery.
Where to start? The assertions that
the computers will have to perform
billions of transactions per minute?
The assertion that the system will
cost “trillions of dollars” (which is
nonsense, and at any rate cannot as
of yet be determined)?

Are we supposed to be so naive as .

to believe that Europeans are “abso-
lutely bewildered” to believe that
‘US. citizens are “buying into" the
SDI? Is this true of all Europeans? It
sounds like quite an exaggeration to
me. Evidence? A couple of “conver-
sations" is hardly conclusive.

There is no point detailing all the
disingenuous assertions and
mischaracterizations in the article (I
counted 10 myself). But how much
of this are we, the public, supposed
to take? The-anti-"SDI forces have
some good points; so do the pro-
SDI people. Why can’t a debate be
attained on a rational, evenhanded
basis, instead of in the divisive
fashion now becoming the standard?

To that end, I would like to issue a
public challenge. to Ms. Rush to
debate the merits of the SDI. I’m
ready anytime; she need only con-
tact me. I can be reached at GSPIA,
Forbes Quad, Box 315. In fact, this
challenge goes out to any informed
citizen concerned with disseminat-
ing evenhanded information and not
simply with scoring debating points.

Review reviewed

I was pleased to read Michael

Selz’s well-written and informed
preview of “The Times of Harvey
Milk," the I984 Academy Award
winner for feature documentary, in
your May 29 issue. Would other
Pittsburgh media have devoted as
much attention to this important
film?

I would, however, call the
author’s attention to one error he
made in the article. Speaking of
Harvey Milk’s election to the San
Francisco Board of Supervisors, he
says: “In I978, at 47, he was elected,
making him the first openly gay city
official in the history of the US.”

"’ In l972, six years before Harvey
Milk’s election, the Human Rights
Party, a municipal third party in
Ann Arbor, Mich., elected Nancy
, Wechsler and Jerry DeGrieck to the
City Council — both of whom sub-
sequently revealed, that they were
gay during their term of office. Their
open gayness created quite a storm
of controversy at the time.

Two years later, in April 1974, the
Human Rights Party elected a third
city couneilor who had campaigned
as an open lesbian. Any of these
three Ann Arbor city councilors
would qualify for the title “... first
openly gay city official in the history
of the US.”

In addition. in November 1974,
Elaine Noble, an avowed lesbian,
was elected as a state representative

2 from Boston.

Not yet having seen the film, it
occurs to me that the author may
have gotten his misinformation
from the film. If so, that only illus-
trates the general ignorance of the
history of homosexuality which con-
tinues to be a part of America’s
blindness. '

But this is merely to set the record
straight and is only a quibble with an
otherwise excellent article.

Film festival force

The British have exported a lot of
fine culture over to us heathens in
the “colonies.” We have the great
British literature, beautiful British
music and now the Shakespeare
Festival.

1 am quite tired, however, of all
the‘“Alfred Hitchcock Film Festi-
vals” being thrust upon us provincial
Pittsburghers as what is truly best
and most representative of the
human character and human
achievement. Critics and experts
proclaim that these films are
wonderful and have everything that
today’s films lack. If Hitchcock’s
ugly films represent sophistication
and civilization, I’ll take Rambo any
day, thanks.

There are some real problems
with Hitchcock’s "films and with his
old_TV show. First and foremost,
pain and human suffering are not
funny or chic. '

This month, there is a Hitchcock
film “festival” at the Pittsburgh
Playhouse, on cable TV on The
Movie Channel. What does “festi-
val” have to do with these ﬁlms? Just
look at the descriptions: “ ‘Rope’:
Two brilliant students decide to kill
a friend for the intellectual thrill and

then throw a party while the body is_

still on the premises in this classic
Hitchcock thriller.” ,

A list ofHitchcock films is a docu-
ment of a preoccupation with people
hurting and killing other people, but
it is done with “humor and style" so
that it is very trendy to call these
great works. To me, this is the oppo-
site of humor. It is my understand-
ing that finally, after all these years,
“Psycho” was re-rated as an R.

When I was little, I remember see-
ing the Television Code explained
every day on TV: “He'll see bad
guys, but not in the role of heroes 

Hitchcock’s TV show made a
mockery of this code every day. A
roly-poly man‘ introduces a “deli-
cious” story on network TV. I
remember clearly my little brother
~ and how upset he was about what he
watched on TV one day. Hitchcock’s
story was of a man famous in his

town for a great secret he kept in a,

jar that the whole town wanted to
see. It turned out to be his wife’s
‘head. That’s not clever, sophisti-
cated dark humor —— that’s sick.

Scary movies have their place, but
they should not be so widely lauded
as great accomplishments of modern
society. It makes me sad that we
hold Hitchcock’s films as what’s fine
and noble to our kids and not the
compassionate, movﬁaig films of,
say, a Frank Capra (“Meet John
Doe,” “What a Wonderful Life”).

Some people might say, “What a
party-pooper, why doesn’t he just
watch what he wants, and let us
watch what we want?” All I’m saying
is, let’s see Hitchcock’s violent films
for what they really are — stories of
a perverse obsession that are passed
off as sophisticated intellectual fun.
They are neither.

Ghosts

Infection,

By Leslie M. Bennett

Henrik Ibsen is not and never
was a popular playwright. His
writing never conformed to pop-
ular tastes. Even though intense
interest in his work has steadily
increased among enlightened
contemporary minds, his plays
are still caviar to the general
audience.

The American Ibsen Theatre,
which takes the works of Ibsen
as its model and inspiration, be-
gins its third season with an eerie”
production of Ghosts. It still
captures the disturbing, if not
scandalous, feelings it did when
it first appeared a century ago.

The play focuses on Mrs.
Helen Alving, who lives in a
society that worships the past
and all its ideals at the expense of
the present. The ghosts she and
her family experience become a
powerful metaphor for the con-
trol the past haslover the present
and for the inherited diseases,

I, both ideological and physical,

infecting her home. The
unnamed disease which is passed
on from the late Mr. Alving to
his son Osvald is syphilis.
Director Travis Preston takes

marriage and the commandment
that man must honor his father
and mother.

Whereas Ibsen may have been
unpopular because he invited his
audiences to think, Preston’s
interpretation invites us to be
shocked and dismayed. His
theatrical devices, conceived
with the help of set designer
Christopher H. Barreca and
lighting designer Stephen Straw-
bridge, appear to have come
right out of a horror film. There
are moments of total darkness,
ﬂashes of lightning and blood-
curdling screams.

The most interesting aspect of
the production is that the
audience is seated directly on the
stage. At times they were only
inches away from the per-
formers. Not only does the
arrangement give a backward
view of the conventional stage —
a thought Ibsen might well have
relished — but it also creates an
inescapable feeling of intimate
confinement, “which fits the
The feeling is
intensified through mounting
suspense and through the
absence of an intermission in a
play which is normally divided
into three acts.

Also fitting to the play’s the-
friatie aetieﬁ is the several inches
of dirt covering the stage floor —
a thick layer of ancient dust
which eventually soils the cos-
tumes of four of the five actors.

Loveond lust
in Nozi Germony

By Michael Selz

Andrzej Wajda’s A Love in

Germany is a love story of a dif-
ferent kind. It’s a story of
doomed lovers, yet it doesn’t
grab out sympathy and summon
our outrage the way, say, Romeo
and Juliet does. From the film’s
beginning, we know that there is
no hope of a happy resolution.
The lovers, a grocery store pro-
prietress in a small German town
and ti Polish POW, are like kam-
ikaze pilots, calmly riding their
emotions toward , an utterly
anticipated destruction. With
their fate known to us from the
outset, we can't cheer them on;
we can only marvel at love’s
capacity for annihilation.
Pauline Kropp (Hanna Schy-
gulla) is a shopkeeper’s wife with
a seven-year-old son and a hus-
band in the German army during
World War II. Stanislaw Zasada
(Piotr Lysak) is a Polish prisoner
of war who is interned in her
village. Since Nazi Germany was
most anxious to maintain the
racial superiority that the “mas-
ter race” idea guaranteed, the
punishment for miscegenation
(sex between a ‘German and a

non—German) was fierce: death
by hanging for the non-German,
and imprisonment for the Ger-
man. These objectives, if not the
precise penalties, were well-
known. But regardless, the two
lovers proceeded with less and
less caution, all but shouting out
their feelings to a contemptuous
village.

It seems that Paulina took the
initiative in this, but even as she
is enslaved by her passion for
this younger man, she has mis-
givings. When. her friend and
bookkeeper Elsbeth (Elisabeth
Tressenaar) loses her fiance to
the war effort, Elsbeth convinces
Paulina to visit her husband
before he goes off to the east
front. It’s evident that she still
cares for her husband, but it is a
sweet, foggy nostalgia, as though
the man is already a fatality. In
fact, when she is on her way to
the train station to embark on
her visit, she learns that Stani is
hospitalized after he’s been
trampled by horses. Without
misgivings she forgets her proper
intentions and rushes to the hos-
pital to throw herself sobbing on

Regina, dressed in white, is the
sole character who, upon learn-
ing the truth about her past, is
allowed to escape infection.
Doom seems to be omnipres-
ent as symbolized by a huge
astrolabe hanging above the
stage. Below, five mannequins

‘ represent each of the characters,

symbolizing the hollow human
existence, which is a theme in
many of Ibsen’s plays. Every
individual, he thought, needs to
discover the kind of person he or
she really is and become that
person.

The cast is extremely strong in

. portraying the internal workings

of human character. Jennifer
Harmon as Mrs. Alving bravely
and enduringly performs in a
role which must be examined on
two I levels: the free-thinking
Mrs. Alving who believes what
she will about the circumstances
that surround her, and the Mrs.

mon as Mrs. Alving in Henrik Ibsen’s Ghosts.

Alving who nevertheless suc-
cumbs to living by appearances
in the hope that she can afford
her son “the joy of life.”
Throughout, she must face
taboos of inherited morality and
in the end confronts the norms
which protect human life.
Pastor Manders, the preacher
of moral obligation and civil

‘duty, is wonderfully depicted by

Steven McHattie. His hoarse
voice and lanky build add to the
decrepitude of what Manders
represents. Completing the cast
are Corliss Preston as Regina,
Robert Toperzer as Jacob Eng-
strand and John Rubin in a wry
and memorable portrayal of
Osvald Alving.

St. Elmo's Fire recycles

old themesto (A effct  

By Dolores Rice

The premise has been used
before. Many- times. And
recently. Just shave 10 years off
The Big Chill cast or add five to
The Breakfast Club. Although
I'm comparing this film to two
others, St. Elmo’s Fire manages
to keep the “dealing with life’’
theme fresh and thoroughly
entertaining as director Joel
Schumacker captures the enthu-
siasm and heartache of graduat-
ing into life after college ~— what
parents call “the real world,
kids.”

Memories and expectations
exist in everyone. When a film is
able to evoke an “I remember” or
a knowing smile or tear, the film-
makers have got themselves a
hit. Sure, fantasy and . action
films have that escapism element
which can let us forget our prob-
lems for a couple of hours. But
there’s something phenomenal
about a film that shows us char-
acters with personalities we can
relate to. Such a film can show us
a new perspective with which to
look at ourselves.

Director Schumacker, who
co-wrote the film with Carl Kur-
lander, introduces the seven
recent graduates partying at
their favorite meeting spot, St.
Elmo’s Bar..

Responsibility is the least
favorite graduation present for
Billy Hixx (Rob Lowe of Class
and Oxford Blues). He and his
saxophone would much rather
be “gettin’ outta hand" at the fra-
ternity house. But now with a
baby and a wife (the latter con-
ceived after the former), he's
finding it difficult to adjust.
Even though Billy appears

uncaring and completely irre-.

A|‘|y Sheedy, Judd Nelson, Emilio Estevez, Demi
Moore, Rob Lowe, More Winninghom and
Andrew McCarthy in St. Elmo's Fire.-

sponsible on the outside, Wendy
(Mare Winningham, most
recently of The Thornbirds)
believes in him. Wendy also
wants to break away from the
pre-planned ‘path her wealthy
parents (“Honey,, marry some-
one who can take care of you”)
have weaved for her. .
Jules (Demi Moore of Blame

‘It on Rio and No Small Affair)

had no problem developing
independence. With no nearby
father and an ailing stepmother,
Jules takes her lonely life to the
limit. Drafted right out of col-
lege into an inter’national bank-
ing career, Jules triesto be the
’80’s cosmopolitan woman. Like
something picked before it was
ripe, Jules had no time between

college and this advanced posi--

tion to fully mature. Her heady
rise to the top leads to an even
speedier fall to rock bottom.
Alec (Judd Nelson, most
recently of The Breakfast Club)

aspires to reach the top of the

' political ladder. Once a commit-

ted Democrat in college, Alec
ends up selling out as a Republi-
can in a cushy, well-paid Repub-
lican position. On this salary,
Alec can secure a candidate-
perfect future for himself and his
college girlfriend, Leslie (Ally
Sheedy of Oxford Blues and The
Breakfast Club). But Leslie is
unsureof her and Alec’s future.
She feels he’s not ready — and
she's right. Sometimes the per-
fect couple in college do not
always end up so perfect.

Love is rarely easy, and unre-
quited love is pure hell. Kirby
(Emilio Estevez of Repo Man
and The Outsiders) and room-
mate Kevin (Andrew McCarthy
of Class and several off-
Broadway productions) live in
hell. Kirby’s studying to become
a lawyer takes a back seat to his
hilarious obsession with the

Fables of the Reconstruction
R.E.M.
I.R.S. Records

R.E.M. are more mysterious
and alluring than ever on their
third lp, Fables of the Recon-
struction. The band insists that
the correct title -is Fables of the
Reconstruction/ Reconstruc-
tion of the Fables, and even a
close examination of the sleeve
leaves doubt as to what to call
this record. Perhaps they7ve been
reading too much James Joyce
lately, though in fact nothing
could be _ more appropriate:
R.E.M.’s music is the aural e-
quivalent of Finnegan’s Wake.

Describing this group’s sound
can lead one perilously close
either to useless hyperbole or to

' complete vagueness. The fact is

that there has never been a band
like this. They owe as much to
The Byrds and The Velvet
Underground as they do Hank
Williams Si., but consciously or
not, they take pop music farther
than any of those artists
dreamed.

How they accomplish this
defies explanation. While dis-
playing a diverse tangle of roots,
their approach to writing songs
is in no sense unique. They use

“Who is this new band called
the Knitters?” you may ask. Are
they five “little old ladies” seek-
ing pop stardom? No, they’re
more like an independent label
equivalent to the Honey-
drippers. Although all the songs
on Poor Little Critter on the
R862! are uriginals, the Knitters’
(composed of Exene Cervenka,
John Doe and D.J. Bonebrake
of X, Dave Alvin of the Blasters
and Jonny Ray Bartel) inspira-
tion is pure country and western.
Is it any good? Well, that’s
debatable.

There is really no doubt that
the band’s heart is in it — or is
there? There are half a dozen
recycled Johnny Cash guitar
riffs and a whole lot of down-

guitar, bass, drums and‘vocals
with little or no embellishment.
All of the musicians are innova-
tive, but none is a virtuoso; the
songs themselves break no new
ground in terms of structure or
content. Yet underlying the
deceptively simple surface of
R.E.M.’s music is a taproot of
intelligence and inspiration that
makes it extraordinary.

Michael Stipe’s husky, mum-
bly singing is virtually impene-
trable, but its sheer evocative
power renders pointless any
attempt to analyze his lyrics.
Hence the comparison to Joyce:
R.E.M. do not present a given,
undisputable meaning in their
songs. Since one is rarely certain
of what Stipe is singing, one can
let the mood of a song evoke its
own imagery and interpret it any
way one desires, creating a uni-
que personal meaning.

Fables of the Reconstruction
finds R.E.M. expanding a bit,
trying some new things, but
remaining very much the same
band. There are some horns in
“Can’t Get There from Here,” a
banjo in “Wendell Gee” and
some strings here and there
throughout the album, but these
are used as ﬂavoring, giving
some additional texture to songs

Cervenka and D.J. Bonebrake of the Knitters.

tables

that could stand without it.
Some of Fables is sparse and del-
icate, such as “Green Grow the
Rushes,” while some ofit is very
dense and full, such as “Auction-
eer (Another Engine),” which

hurtles along like a runaway‘

train, or “Feeling Gravity’s
Pull,” with its ominous, mourn-
ful cello.

Like Murmur, the band's
deput lp, Fables works better in
its entirety than on the basis of
its individual cuts. While all of
the songs hold up on their own,
they seem, away from the frame-
work of the album, somehow
unfinished, like a piece of an
emotion or a fragment of a
thought. Singles, then, do not
appear to be R.E.M.’s main con-
cern. Their albums are designed
to be taken whole.

An exception to this rule,
however, is “Can’t Get There
from Here,” which opens side
two. It’s not the best song on the
record, but it is certainly the
most striking, with an off-the-
wall, almost whimsical melody
during the verse that erupts into
an electrifying call-and-response
melee for the chorus. It also is
the best shot R.E.M. have had
yet for a hit single. (But then,
that’s what everyone said about

Some of the songs on this

But others, like “Rock Island

plain silly. “Rock Island Line,”
for instance, sounds very much

like a variation on “Old McDon- .

The record’s enigma is their

Cupid 8. Psyche 85: a standoff

Although Cupid & Psyche 85,
Scritti Politti’s latest lp, is a
clever assemblage of dance pop,
it doesn’t nearly ‘match the eso-

teric air created by the albumr

title or the band’s name. But this
is hardly a run-of-the-mill
album; rather, it’s a very safe

venture into obscurity. (Or
maybe it’s the other way
around.) '

Vocalist Green Gartside is
what construction workers com-
monly refer to as a sissy. He is
slight and feminine, has a silly
name, writes lyrics like “drown-
ing in my teardrops” and has a
voice that makes Michael Jack-
son sound macho. If this idio-
syncrasy seems an in-
surmountable obstacle, then
avoid Cupid 8: Psyche 85. Gart-
side’s fey affectations —~ includ-
ing his peculiar tendency to
pronounce a hard “r” -— are the
focal point of the album. But if
you’re able to accept his breathy
phrasings —— somewhat like
accepting Johnny Rotton’s rasp,

to her passion as the only thing
she has left.

‘view on the meaning of life. His

secret love causes Jules to believe
that he’s gay, and the others
believe that he’s too intellectual
for his own good.

, All of these characters are real
people. We all recognize them
and their feelings. Billy once says
in the film that “we're all going
through this [rough times]  it’s
our time on the edge.” It’s a time
when life must be reckoned with,
a time when expectations can
turn into disappointments,
dreams and hopes into illusions.

ous it can be to go from dream-
ing about your future to actually

only at the other end of the spec-
trum — there’s a good deal of
danceable pop in store.

Side one opens with “The
Word Girl,” an airy reggae track
not unlike Culture Club’s “Do
You Really Want to Hurt Me,"
though more melodic and sub-
stantial. While easily the best
track on the lp (it’s currently No.
2 in England), “The Word Girl”
is atypical of Cupid & Psyche 85.

The rest of the lp is techno-
funk/white-boy hip-hop to the
nth degree, sparkling in its pro-
duction. Each track is so laden
with intricate funk guitar, pop
bass, stall-start synthetic drums
and huge keyboards that it
makes Prince’s 1999 seem thin —
no exaggeration. Occasionally, a
song is bogged down by its pro-
duction, as in the case of “Hyp-
notize,” a confusing hip-hop
track that should have the family
pooch chasing its tail in no time.
However, the song is redeemed
by its exceptionally strong cho-
rus, which brings us to the less

obscure facet of Scritti Politti.
While the beat dominates
Cupid & Psyche 85 (a fact that
will set Scritti Politti in a cate-
gory with DeBarge and other
dance-floor fodder), there is a
definite care taken in the song-
writing (a fact that should set
Scritti Politti apart from their
disco-minded contemporaries).

“Wood Beez (Pray Like Are- A I

tha Franklin)” — don’t ask me
what it means — is a wonderful
dance track with a killer bass line
that could set James Watt danc-
ing. It also has a strong melody
and interesting chord changes:
Underneath all of the over-
whelming production, there
actually is a song.

At its best, Cupid & Psyche 85
offers something a little beyond
the typical dance-floor’ throb of
the genre. At its worst, it’s a self-
serving barrage of studio mas-
turbation. Call it a stand-off.

This is a satisfying time for Shel-

women's volleyball team at Pitt.
After completing a highly successful
season and then adding an outstand-
ing recruiting class, he is now in

California assisting in the develop- .

ment of the U.S.A. Women's
National Volleyball Team.

This past season — Collier’s fifth

After Kohutiak, outside hitter Pat
Belcher and setter Cathy Rupp grad-
uated this year, Collier had some big
shoes to fill in the off season. He
responded to the challenge by sign-
ing his finest recruiting class ever.

Next year, Collier will have the
best prep players from Pennsylva-
nia, Ohio and New York in Nora

of Farrell High School. Stewart was
considered one of the top prospects
in the nation in 1983. Noreen
Coughlin, who is a transfer from the
Air Force Academy, also will be
eligible to play this season. These
players combined with a nucleus of
veterans should bring excitement to
Fitzgerald Field House.

Although most coaches look for-
ward to some relaxation during the
summer months after such a busy
year, Collier is a young coach eager
to continue learning. In August, he
will again coach the West team for
the Keystone State Games at Penn
State. But right now he is at the
Olympic Training Center in San
Diego assisting his former coach at
Ohio State, Terry Liskevych, in
developing the 1988 women’s Olym-
pic team.

In addition to some administra-
tive duties, Collier‘s responsibilities
include scouting international oppo-
nents, observing players in tourna-
ments, assisting in drilling the team
and helping to develop the setters —
a position which he carried All-
America honors while playing at
Ohio State.

Liskevych has labeled Collier
“one of the best young coaches in
volleyball today.” With all of the
attention he is receiving, can we
expect to see him at Pitt much
longer?

‘‘I have aspirations to continue to
grow and do things on the Olympic
level but not at the expense of myjob
here at Pitt,” Collier said. “Right
now l’m more content and pleased
with the situation here at Pitt than
I’ve - ever been in my coaching
career.”

Collier saw the possibility of vol-
leyball being cut or de-emphasized
at Pitt a few years ago, but he no
longer sees that as a problem since
Carol Sprague was named the assis-
tant athletic director for women's
sports.

“With Carol Sprague taking over,
it's had a lot to do with my content-
ment and a lot of the coaches’ con-
tentment with the situation here,"he
said. “I see us as being on the
upswing, and I’m more satisfied with
staying here long-term, and that’s

and a sincere interest in women's
sports.”

The team and players have set
some lofty goals for next season. In
addition to another Big Iiast cham-
pionship, they want to finish in the
top 15 nationally. Next year's sched-
ule includes the likes of Penn State,
Purdue and Tennessee, all of which
are expected to be ranked in the Top
20. V

Collier believes that the players
will accomplish those goals, and he
is also setting the foundation toward
some long-term goals. “Next year we
could have the best team in the
East,” he said. “Possibly the year
after that, we could be one of the
best in this half of the country. And
after that, who knows — we could
really take off and do some great
things. And I want to stay here and
see that.”

With the team improving and
national-caliber competition com-
ing to the field house, Collier looks
forward to increased attendance at
home games. “There are matches in
the Midwest that exceed 8,000 peo-
ple,” he said. “We have not come to
that yet but we're on the verge of it,
and I think my team_will be ready for
it. I think we’re playing good enough
-a lot of times to deserve that kind of
attention, but it's a slow process and
we have to be patient.” The Pitt-
Providence match on Oct. 17 at the
field house will be followed by a

Herb Sendek, a native of Pitts-
burgh, Pa., has been named a gradu-
ate assistant at Providence College
by Rick Pitino,. the Friars’ recently
appoint_ed basketball coach.

Sendek, who graduated No. 1 in

his class at Carnegie-Mellon Univer-_

sity’s school of industrial manage-
ment this past May, accumulated a

3.9 grade point average on a 4.0 scale

while earning summa cum laude’

honors. In addition, the Pittsburgh

     

  
   

match between the Olympic teams
from the U.S. and Japan.

Unlike many coaches, Collier
takes an interest in the players’ aca-
demic development. Last year, the
women’s volleyball team posted a
collective 3.09 GPA, the highest of
any sports team on campus. Many
of the players are on the dean’s list
and honor roll.

Collier believes in recruiting girls
who have a good academic record in
order to play his style of volleyball.
“When I sit in a living room, I get a
feel for the kind ofcommitment they
are going to make in volleyball and
in the classroom," he said. “If they
are determined to excel in volleyball,
that carries over to a determination
to excel in the classroom.”

native received a Carnegie Merit
Scholarship.

Sendek was class valedictorian of
Penn Hills High Seheel in 1981
while compiling a perfect 4.0 grade

point average. In I981, he was
selected as Junior Citizen of the
Year in Penn Hills and also served as
captain of his high school's basket-
ball team, which went 22-5 that year

and were sectional champions. As a
senior, he was named to the Pitts-
burgh Press All-Brain Team as well
as the Pittsburgh East Suburban
All-Star Team.

“Herb Sendek is a tireless young
worker,” commented Pitino. “We
welcome his enthusiasm and dedica-
tion. to our staff.”

University of Pittsburgh
women's basketball coach Kirk
Bruce has added yet another Pitt
graduate to his staff by naming
former Pitt point guard Wayne
Williams assistant ‘basketball
coach.

Williams, a former standout at
Pitt under Tim Grgurich, is the
third former Pitt athlete hired by
the university this year in the
women's program. Bruce, a

_ former player who led the men’s

team in scoring in 1974, was
named head. Then Carol Dugan,
a standout under former coach
Judy Saurer, was named
assistant.

. Both Bruce and Dugan are in
Harrisburg and were unable to
be reached, but Bruce was
quoted in a Pitt release as stating,
“Wayne has a unique sense for
the game. He can recognize bas-
ketball talent. His knowledge of
the game will be essential in the
instruction of our young athletes
and refinements of their skills.”

Williams graduated from Pitt
in 1979 with a degree in law
administration, but his basket-
ball talents carried him overseas
to Spain for a brief period of pro-
fessional basketball in Real
Madre. Currently, Williams has
been involved with Equitable
financial services.

Williams’ career at Pitt lasted
from I975 to I979. He lettered all
four years and finished with a
l0.2 average in his senior year.
Williams also played high school
hall for Schenley High School,

where he was a member of their
1975 state championship squad.

through a serious operation, but
that fear has since subsided,” he
said.

Maslek is a 6-9 center from Free-
dom High School who grew seven
inches in one year during his high
school career. (Your back would be
sore too, if you grew that much in
that short time). The healing process
seems to be taking its own route,
though - something that will suit
both Maslek and Pitt. With the
addition of Tico Cooper and the re-
turn of Keith Armstrong, there is no
hurry for Maslek to return to I00
percent. Pitt does not really need,
barring injuries, a major contribu-
tion from Maslek until 1987. Just
imagine if Maslek keeps growing at
the same rate he has over the past
few years: He should be standing
around 7-5 by then.
