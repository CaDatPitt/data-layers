Finishing touches for the Cathedral have not been com-

However, Liles Creighton, assistant director of the Phys-

Following their arrival yester-
day, the envoy was the guest of
some of Pittsburgh's top industrial

A special request for this con-
ference was made by the State
Department. Mrs. Jaroszewicz,
preceding her marriage, had been
a journalist, and was looking for-
ward to meeting American women
reporters.

Since neither of the women
speak English, Frank Gospo-

Says Inter-Arab Struggle, Nasser Are Causes

:Pratt Discusses ‘Middle East  
Tensionsg’ Gives A General Plan

 

  

  

By NATHAN FIRESTONE

According to Simcha Pratt, consul—general of Israel to
the United States, the greatest‘ tension in the Middle East
today is the inter—Arab struggle, the attempt by President
Nasser of the United Arab Republic to dominate the Arab

world.

Speaking to a handful of students’ in the SU Lounge, 3

p.m. Tuesday, March 22, Pratt,dis-0

cusessed “Middle East Tensions.”

Introduced by Dr. Richard Cot-
tam of the political science de-
partment, Pratt went into a rather
general analysis of problems that
were plaguing the Middle East.

Problem Cited

Another tension that was high
on his list was that concerning
the future of the Arab refugees.
“If the Arabs had not opposed the
partition of the Palestine area by
the UN; there would be no Arab
refugees p_roblem today.

. “However, they ‘" encouraged
these unfortunate people to
leave. Actually, the Israeli gov-
ernment wanted them to stay,
since they _were of great value
in‘ the agricultural fields of our
new state,” he declared.

Pratt also reminded those stu-
dents in attendance that it was
impractical for Israel to accept
,the.r_efu_gees, since they had.been

“Trojan Horse” is acciepted.

After stopping to light his cigar,
which he had done four times be-
fore, and which was now about an
inch long, he pointed out a par-
allel between the Arab refugees
and the Tories during our Revolu-
tionary War, who fled in the wake
of Washington’s army to Canada.

“After the war was over, and
they wantedlto return to their
homes, Washington would not
permit it because he feared their
presence would designate a fifth
column,” he explained.‘

In a personal interview before
the program, Pratt answered ques-
tions concerning Israel’s economy,
and other Mid-East problems.

Quotes Gurion

by Prime Minister Ben Gurion of

it had not been donated it prob-

longer to complete this ﬂoor.
Concerning ﬁnances, Creighton
-said that 180 thousand dollars

“are allocated to his department

each year. This money must be

used for the minor repairs of 29'

buildings on campus.

“For example,” said Creighton,
“in one month we spent $13,670
of which $3,100 was spent on the
Cathedral and $1,225 was.spent
on Schenley Hall. _

“These expenses vary from
month to month, and also from
building .to building” said
Creighton. All of these expenses
are incurred merely from gen-.

_ eral expenses that incur from

day to day. .- -

department wishes to do work
that is not considered a general
expense for example, 7 com-

ter Vieh, assistant chancellor of
Business Affairs.

Vieh Must Approve

If Vieh gives his approval to

this proposal, then he provides the

Creighton said, “I must stress that
the_se are universityafunds, and
not funds received from. outside
sources.”

Mr. "Creighton concluded by
saying, “Unless. money is donated
to ﬁnish these areas, immediately,
the ‘member's ,of the university
mustbe as patient in waiting for
completion {as we «are in waiting
for the ‘necessary funds. ‘

Many people have wondered
why the main steps, of- the
Cathedral have been blockaded

.7--for the past six weeks. Creigh-

ton explained that the support
beneath the steps has weakened.
‘Since each of these steps is ce-
mented to the base step, the weak-
ening of this foundation would re-
sult in the steps caving in if they
were in continual .use. _ ‘

grown to the point where it han-

dles 2,500 job applications ‘from Q

students every year in addition to
1,100 applications from alumni.

“I will miss the university
greatly. After eight years any-

V this is particularly true with
me,” Dr. Sherwood said.
In parting he leaves this word

Dr. Ritenour was graduated
from the university in 1928 with
a B.A. and received his master’s

Q The Road Remains’ Rocky

Contrary to the feeling that once prevailed as the end
of a term neared, students under the present educational
system do not look forward to the end of the trimester.
The reason for the changein attitude is simple: too much
work must be done during the last few weeks of the term.

That period is here now, though, and with it comes -

ﬁnal examinations. Unfortunately, it hasn’t been too long
since the last farcial folly. Those last few days of the fall
trimester are remembered with no fondness. V I

Some attempt has been made since L’affaire Decembre
to ease the students’ burdens in the ﬁnal days. Most teachers.
set earlier deadlines this trimester for term papers. Un-
fortunately, though, nothing much has been done——perhaps
nothing much can be done——to eliminate the confusion and
conﬂict during the week of April 11. '

The various schools have asked their instructors to stag-
ger ﬁnal examinations in order to avoid the great rush
which occurred last trimester. Some teachers have taken
this advice by scheduling ﬁnals for dates earlier than April
11; others have assigned “take—home” ﬁnals. . A

These teachers, however, are all too few. Most members

of the faculty have retained the old method of giving the
'tests'in class during the last week of school. They rightfully

claim they cannot afford to give up any class hours prior to
the last week. . ~

The situation may be summed up briefly: the adminis-
tration———where the basic responsibility 1ies—has not formu-
lated a concrete, constructive solution to the problem. From
all indications, it is not about to do so in the future.

While some universities progress toward a. broader,
more time-consuming ﬁnal examination period——adopting a

-a reading period, for example—this university is headed in

the opposite direction, if it has not already arrived there.

In the past few weeks, the university has been hinting
praise for the trimester system because 30 to 40 per cent
of the student body will attend the spring trimester. The
system also has been praised by the president of /Columbia
University in an article appearing in a national magazine.

4 When such "great failings as—with ﬁnals-—exist, how-

ever, we cannot go along with the praise. Outward appear-x

ances may be ﬁne, but there is no fooling the persons in
direct contact with it. They know there is much tobe done.

No Accusations . . .

A Two-Way Story

By John Lowenthol

A couple of weeks ago, when Dr. Jonas Salk
announced that he was leaving Pitt, the University
lost one of its ﬁnest and certainly its ‘most cele-
brated ﬁgure. His announcement toleave has pre-
cipitated a profuse variety of
comment hanging from the
“Good riddance, Joe” of a few __
shortsighted medical people tcna 
withering blast at the “iron ﬁst’’ '
of Chancellor Edward Litchﬁeld. '

The thoughtful observer won- .
ders if anybody or anything "
really is to blame for the turn .of
events or whether, as Dr. Salk
said, he is merely accepting a
magniﬁcent opportunity that .
happens to be elsewhere. _ ' -

It is easy to blame somebody: Dr. Litchﬁeld for
failing to make a satisfactory offer of facilities and
independence to the committee on a research insti-
tute at Pitt which met in 1958 and promptly fell
through, or Dr. Salk’ for behaving as a pitiable
Arrowsmith, ﬂying blindly from “evils he has, to
evils he knows not of.:.T , '

But although these indictments offer an attrac-
tive explanation of the facts, the facts may perhaps
be more profitably and accurately interpreted to
blam neobody. It may be found that Dr. Salk’s
leaving Pitt was just part of his plan for a great
Institute of Biological Research, and that Dr. Litch-
ﬁeld actually did all he could for the.beneﬁt of
the University.

Parkinson Would Soy .' .' .

The criticismgof Dr. Litchﬁeld’s handling of the
situation is that he attempted to impose on the
researchers an administration too “complex for the

good of the research. The defense of such a bur-

eaucratic administration is to be found in the rec-
ords of universities whose administrations arejust

I that.

There is no question at Harvard, for instance,

who runs the university. The administration does. .
vSo does it _at Yale, Princeton, and Penn. These

universities aretknown as “successful.” A strong
administration is accepted as part of the scheme
of things.

As Dr. Litchﬁeld is possibly the most energetic:

Chancellor Pitt has had in ‘a while, he is bound
to generate some resentment, but there is no evi-
dence from other schools that his type of strong
adiriiiiistration ultimately produces results other
than the.best._ '

  

in Pittsburgh, say at Wildwood?

So one must assume that Dr. Litchﬁeld’s pro-
posals to the Committee on the Institute were moti-
vated from a professional consideration of what
would be the best way to operate such an insti-
tute within the framework of the University.
None but the lviest

Nor can the Committee’s (and Dr. Salk’s) re-
jection of the Litchﬁeld proposals be construed
properly as a rejection of the Chancellor and his
ideas. A

Dr. Salk pointed out at his press conference

that there is but one other institute of this type in 9*

the country — the institute‘ at Princeton.

r‘The record showed that maximum results were
obtained by being close tola big university but yet
independent of it. Were_the institute a large one
the problem might be different, but this Institute

of Dr. Salk’s will havea senior staff of but ten

members. _
With the operations “limited only by the imagi-
nation of themen” it was felt, with great justiﬁ-
cation, that it would be best to ‘operate as a family
rather than as a community. For this institute is .
to be, like the very potent Israeli underground, an
army “without uniform, without rank.” . ‘

Nothing of the Some

Why could the Institute not be established here
When the ten
or so senior scientists who will form the Institute
decided to organize, each of‘ their present univer-
sities ‘made an “offer” of one sort, or another. It
was not a "matter for Dr. Salk to lay down the law,
nor was there simply" a comparison of offers.

As Dr. Salk once said in an article in the Pitts-

--

‘ burgh Press,‘ “Freedom is a biological necessity.”

Perhaps he felt, and the nine others with" him, that _

it was best to be free, not only from a university?"

proper, but from the academic tradition of any
particular area. Hence they chose California, whose
only academic tradition has been imagination, but
where there is a great center of learning. The
“freedom” thus became not only a biological neces-
sity for the human being, but a human necessity
for biological ‘science as well. . i . .»

Whatever the considerations that led Dr. Salk
and his colleagues to settle on San Diego, it is best
to assume that they are not personal and. pettish,
for pettishness is very unlike Dr. Salk.

It is not for ‘us at Pitt to feel resentful toward), ’

anyone, but only to be grateful that a great sci-
entist has spent thirteen of, his best years with us,
and to try to I begin the great work of ﬁlling
his place.. I -

"Student Questions
University Plans.

Editor, Pitt News: 4
As_ an interested student in
university affairs, 1 have a num-

I her of questions pertaining to
university policy, which, through »

quiery of the Pitt News might
become known, not only to me,
but to other interested students.

To begin, I must congratulate
the university for establishing a
very fine book center, which will
certainly _be instrumental in
stimulating student thought, and
a tribute to the Pitt student.

Question: Why isn’t the stu-

dent given a break in purchasing
«there? Perhaps, a discount of ten
percent on academic needs. This
will, indeed, help both the stu-
dent and the instructor.

Since coming to Pitt, I have
heard great things about the
future ofthe schools of the
health professions, and in par-
ticular the medical school. A

Question: What new "horizons
are being opened to the dental

‘school, or is this a forgotten
entity‘! Is it, not deserving of
the best men and equipment?
What future and ‘what develop-
mcnts are being done in behalf
of the dental school?

The pharmacy school has had
an acting-dean for two and a
half years. Qtiestion? Why has
the administration not yet ap-
pointed a permanent dean or is
this an example of the admini-

' strativc inefficiency that Salk
is opposed to? '

The Interfraternity Council is
a living body at the "university.
Question: In the past year what
has it accorn'plished?_

A  challenge: the Pitt. Net_ps- to

seek the answers to these ques-
tions. and publish, such for the
beneﬁtof the student body. In
my opinion the only way to do
this is to seek testimony for Dr.

Suggestions Given

. By Angry Junior

Editor, Pitt News: 
After i reading several articles
in our local newspapers, I was
wondering if you could tell me
what our‘ chancellor, Dr. Litch-
ﬁeld, is tryingto do._ ’
. I am referring‘ to Dr. Litch-
ﬁeld’s venture into the business
world,
Inc., . and Studebaker-Packard
Corp. (chairman of the board
and director respectively).

Do you think this is against A

the«Sherman Act or would come
under the jurisdiction of the
Federal Trade Commission? If
this Lark deal fails to attract
new professors, the’ next step
might be refrigerators and fur
coats.

And what is wrong with the
professors we have here now?
As long as they are competent
p1‘0fesS01‘s,' what do we care if
they don’t like Larks or Smith-
Coronas????? A

I amhoping Dr. Litchﬁeld gets
on the board of directors of some
company that manufactures Na-
tional Ensigns. The last time I
was up at the ﬁeld house (Pitt-

Penn State Basketball game) we-

sang the Star Spangled Banner
looking at a' flag with only 48
stars on it. , '

What I would like tosee come

namely Smith-Corona,’

  

school and the spirit of the Pitt
student. To accomplish this « I
propose a four point program as
follows: ‘
1. Less YES men on campus.
2. Less Smith—Coronas on cam-
pus. ‘
3. Less Larks on campus.
4. Less one Dr. Litch

Editor, Pitt News:

With regard to your editorialf? 

“Tuesday at Noon,” of February
22, 1960, _there is really no.
mystery concerning the originof

and reason for exclusively dele-

gating one hour a week for /the
worship of God at the -University
of Pittsburgh. ‘ '
This institution was founded
by Christians — Protestants of
the Presbyterian denomination.
As Christians we find it ab-‘
solutely necessary to daily set
aside a portion of our time for_

communion with our Lord in ‘
some form of worship.

We of the faculty and student
body who claim the Promises of
the Bible do not attempt to
“gear” the worship of God.along
an “exclusive” channel, for the
message of the Gospel of Jesus
Christ was “to the Jew ﬁrst, then
to the Gentile.”

As for the person(s) who set
the policy of establishing .a spec-
iﬁc time for this worship, they_
are “saints at home with thei1*~

Quit Criticizing, Look
At Many ‘Advantages

» Editor, Pitt News:

Ho hum, another editorial
compalining about the Tuck
Shop, the unpainted room here
or there or possibly even the old
elevator situation.

Dear reader, I know just how
you feel, for I share your dread
every time I read the Max Shul-
man ad and the front page news
(in that order).

For after these, come the edi-
torials with all their dull, driv-
eling complaints. The only com-
plaint in this column, however,
concerns the‘ people who write
such editorials. They want only
to criticize. They don’t seem to
be aware of the many advant-
ages at Pitt: its activities, ad-
vancements, and its “life.”

-Nobody seems to realize that
millions of dollars are being

._spent in the enlargement of fa-'-4
cilities for the students beneﬁt.

“Why buy so much at one time?”
Simply because ' of economic
reason. ,

-Property costs and'values in
the Oakland area are on the rise,
so the university buys while it
can do so relatively cheaply.

Nobody seems to know that
there were over ten university
functions one week for the stu-
dents, ranging from a lecture on
photoropism on Friday afternoon
by world famous Dr. Reinhold to

' Engineering Week with its vari-

ed events and debates.

The university functions ex-
clude all fraternity, sorority and
extra—curricular activities. No-
body has commented on the
“made before your eyes” sand-
wiches of the Tuck Shop or the
painting of the library. -

Nobody seems to look at the
Tuck Shop as a retreat, with that
homey “lived in” look. The Tuck
Shop, as someone once said, is
like a_- chameleon — because -it
adapts to the pers_0n’s‘mood.

As for myself, I like the in-
formality. I like to be able to
put out my cigarette on the

floor. I like to put my feet up-

if there is room, and if_not, I
like the crowded booths ‘with
their chatter.

‘Whole Men’ Lacking
In All Departments

Editor, Pitt News:

Re Joel Filner’s article of
March 21: There has been talk
lately of the “whole man” theory
of. education and that is probably
a good thing. It is interesting to
note, however, that the loudest
exponents of this theory appear
to be those students enrolled in

»a “liberal arts” course, that is,

the humanities and social sci-
ence majors.

What these people fail to
realize is that a “whole man” is
neither one‘ who has specialized
in a science nor one who has
specialized in English, history,
political science, etc.

I wonder how many English
majors, for example, would be

willing to take one year of-

chemistry, one of biology,/one of
physics and one ofmathematics
in order to become more well-
rounded intellectually.

After all, no matter how hard
one tries to ignore it, the fact
remains that science is an in-
tegral part of modern culture. It
behooves one who is attempting
to become a “whole man” to
understand at least the funda-
mentals of" that ﬁeld of study
which may one day determine
the type of society in which he
lives. ,

I would also object to Mr.
Filner’s dogmatic (and: some-
what over-worked) criticism. of
engineers. To be sure, there is a

It’s no skin off anyone’s

dearth of culture inithe engi-

neering schools, but it is never-’

theless a dangerous oversimpli-
iication to class 2131 engineers as

money—hungry clods bearing a.

strong resemblance to IBM ma-
chines. It has apparently never
occurred to ..l\/Ir. Filner that en-
gineers can be just as interested
in engineering as he is in En-
glish. A

however, then I would remind
Mr. Filner of the many English
majors who spend. their natural
science credits chasing rats in
pseudo-scientiﬁc psychology labs
or stumbling over simple arith-
metic in core curriculum courses.

I would also remind" him of. the C

many English majors whose
only motivation for studying En-
glish is the desire to confcrm to
the popular picture of,pseudo-
intellectual non—conformity.

In the ﬁnal analysis, the truly
well-rounded person, or “whole
man,”,is not necessarily one who
enrolls in liberal arts courses,
but one who is interested in
these ﬁelds regardless of his

respect for absolutes.

Work Guaranteed

"Quality and Satisfaction Is Our ‘Mark of Service"

SHE HAS one or THE MOST

UNUSUAL JOBS IN BUSINESS TODAY

He’s a computer programmer.

‘It's a job that didn’t even exist until a few years ago. But today it’s one

of the most important—and certainly most unusual— jobs that a college
graduate can do. Data processing systems, withtheir advanced technol-
ogies and tremendous speeds, offer new challenges to college graduates.
It is a ﬁeld for new ideas, new methods, and new techniques.

Setting Up The Problem

A computer programmer analyzes a business, industrial, or scientiﬁc
problem, and translates it into a language which the computer can
“understand.” From there the computer goes to work with prodigious
speed and accuracy. Often it can solve problems in minutes, which
might take days or even weeks, if done by other methods. -

The assignments are interesting. IBM programmers have programmed
computers ' tell businessmen the best locations for «new factories; help"
engineers design electronic circuitry; laid manufacturers in ﬁnding the
most profitable potential market for new products; work out payroll
or quality—controlproblems at the push of a few buttons; and even
analyze how other computer programs should be developed.

Your Logical Abilities Go To Work

N 0 previous experience, or even knowledge of the way computers work,
is necessary to begin a career‘ as a computer programmer. But you
should have the talent and ability to analyze complex problems, to think
clearly and to express yourself well. These, plus a college degree with
two years of college mathematics, are important prerequisites.

If you qualify as a computer programmer, you will be given an inten-
sive training course in the problem-solving methods of the computer.
The salaries are excellent, and your future could be as unlimited as the

future of the computer itself. If you think you might be interested in I

becoming a computer programmer, you can obtain more details ‘from
the IBM representative who can be contacted through your College
Placement Director.

Rex .Peery’s matmen took an early lead in the ﬁrst day
of the NCAA wrestling tournament but then tallied off as
they lost but one wrestler by thetime the, ﬁnals came around.

Larry Lauchle, Panther captain, was the only Cat to

.1; reach the ﬁnals and even he ‘failed to win his division.
‘ Lauchle had to be satisﬁed with second as he lost a. close, 5-2,

decision to Stan Abel of the Uni—¢

versity of Oklahoma. Abel was f'e11_

last year’s 130—pound champion.
It‘ was the second year in a
row that Lauchle has ﬁnished sec-

_»'ond in the Nationals. Last year as

a sophomore he dropped down to
123 pounds where he lost to Dave

4 Auble of Cornell. Auble ‘won the

123 pound class ‘again this "year
-when he decisioned Masaki Hatta
of Oklahoma State, 9-5.

 J, Panthers Take Early Lead

Going into the quarter—ﬁna1s
the Panthers were leading the
ﬁeld with. 11.pQ11’l_tS.~ They were
followed by Iowa, Iowa -State,
.Oklahoma,- Penn State a and
Wyoming; — '

At this time the] Panthers had

four matmen still in the run-
ning. Dick Martin,“ Lauchle,
Daryl Kelvington and Len Vu-
_ colo had won their first ‘two
‘ matches._ Only John Zolikoff

~~r”and Tom Hall had fallen by. the
_“ wayside.

Both Hall ‘and Zolikoff had
crowns just two
weeks before but both saw their
dreams of a ‘National title fade
when they -lost in the second
round of wrestling.
' _ _ Three More Fall

In the quarter ﬁnals three of

the remaining Peerymen
Dave Camaoine of Ohio State beat
Martin, 11-9, in the 123 pound
class.’ La‘uchle advanced by down-
ing Jerry Headington of Utah 8-2.
In the‘ 137 pound class Kelvington.
who had registered two previous
pins, lost .to Les Anderson of Iowa
State, 5-2. ' ’

And the ﬁnal Cat to fall was
Vuocolo in the 177 pound di-
vision.— Hedropped a 4-2 de-
cision to George Ihnat of In-
diana. ' " ' "

The Panthers ﬁnished eighth
with Oklahoma winning with a
total of 59 points. Penn State
ﬁnished ahead of the Panthers
with 25 points to 21 for the Cats.
A With Penn State beating out the
Panthers in the Nationals, the

Nittany Lions won the battle for"

1960 between the two rivals. In
the regular season meet the Lions
and Cats battle to a tie.

Then in the Easterns both
schools ﬁnished with the same
number of points to end in'a ﬁrst
place tie. But the Lions ﬁnally
got the edge in the Nationals as
they were able to place more men
then the Panthers.

The Panther thinclads won the
Senior Allegheny Mountain Assn.
_ AAUI meet over the weekend to
close out their “indoor season.
Coach Carl Rees’ trackmen easily

‘ ‘outscored the ﬁeld as. they regis-

tered 40 points. Their nearest rival
.was the Amrnon A. C. with 20
points. ' ~

In third place came the Panther’

frosh registering 111/4 points. In-
dd-ividual winners for the Cat var-
sity were Regis Goggin in the
high hurdles, Bill Hinchberger in
the mile run, Larry Och in the
shot put, Ed Vamos in -the broad
Jump and Lee Pfrofgner who tied
for ﬁrst inthe. pole vault.

putting his ltrackmen through
their paces on the Field House

pears to, be slowly coming into
form. _Co—Captains Mel Ba:nwell
and "Ron Rush_are leading the

runners in both short and long _

distances.

Once again this year'Barnwe'l1
will be counted, on to. lead the
Panthers in the sprints. Speedy
Barnwell holds the worlds in-
door record for the 300-yard run

with 30 seconds flat and has tied A

the 60- in 6.1 seconds.

“Last year he had to enter
too many events and wasn’t as
effective as ‘ ‘e could have been,”
said Rees. Having a better bal-
anced team could help Barnwell
break a few Panther records.

Rush has been the backbone of
the Cats distance runners for the
past two seasons. This year Rush
is shooting for the Panthers mile
record of 4:12.8 set by John Wood-
ruff in 1939. ' W

“I feel this is the year for that
record,” Rush said. “My times
were good this winter and once_
the weather "gets warm I know I,"ll
be able to improve. 2 '

Spring ‘Practice
Finds’. Mifters,
Gridders   at Work

_ .. 3, TED COLTON

  

Last Thursday we ventured up to ‘the Field'House to
1-,. see what we thought weuld be the ﬁrst- day of spring practice

* for the Panther gridders. We had several reports that the
‘ ‘football team would be working out in the Field house
 where-the ground crew had removed part of the bleachers".

— To our surprise we saw.Coach Bobby Lewis’ baseballers

'going-through some inﬁeld drills. The"Panther mentor had .

 his starting inﬁeld’ working ‘on. the bunt and the pick-off

.' plays. Jerry Matulevic was at third, "Pete _Suder at short-

7 Estop, Pete Colangel.o at second and Ron Maser’ atﬁrst. The

 battery was Dick Wirthon the mound and Fred Laningharri
behind the plate. - y ‘ 5 g _ V ’ ».

To say they looked sharp the short time‘ we wer.e there

 '-would not be true. But Coach Lewis is just beginning to mold

 his inﬁeld together. If Suder can hold up his end at short-

J stop the Cats will have one of the best inﬁelds in college.’
4* * 0 =1: * *

‘ The inﬁeld drills were interrupted- every few minutes
when someone would yell “track,” and three or four track
men would come tearing aroundthe curve at full speed cut-
ting right through‘ the middle of the “inﬁeld.” ‘

- 4% ¥ * * =t= ‘
If someone would ever forget to clear the frack, one
of those runners might ﬁnd himself in themiddle of a
run downbetween third base and home plate.

We got the word_from a knowledged bystander that the
football team was practicing‘ in the Stadium. So off we went
ready to get a few pictures of “spring” practice. When we
arrived at the Stadium we saw the football team spreadout
in three groups. - ’
‘ It III * It * I I

The line-men were working on’ some dummies, while
the backﬁeld was running the double reverse play. Theﬁeld
was muddy and footing was difficult. Time and again a half-
back fell and lost the ball. Most of the players when they
weren’t running in the plays were jumping around to keep
warm. » _ L _ r 4 b

Seconds after we got our picture, a dark cloud came
overhead and the snow really started to come down. "If
the Panthers had been practicing passing drills at that
time they would have undoubtfully-lost a couple of balls

because the snow was so thick,» ,
* * * Ii? * *

Omour way out we passed Coach John Michelosen, who
was moving from group to group and keeping things moving.
The snow was still coming down in torrents andthe Panther
mentor made some remark on the snow and went about his

a business. ‘ ' e

When we got back to the office, thoroughly cold and cov-
ered with snow we made it a point to take another look at
the calendar. Yes, spring practice had begun, but someone-
better tell the weather because he doesn’t know it.

to collect for the book, etc.

Books may be purchased begin-
ning the afternoon of April 18,
Registration Day, and for a week
thereafter. ’

On April 26, students who con-
tributed‘ books to be sold may col-

‘ lect their money, or, if the books
have not been sold, they may be
picked up at this time.

There will be a ten-cent
charge to both the student sell-
ing the books and to the student
buying the books. This money
will go to the student activities
fund and to needy students.

Larry Land, co-chairman of the

-Exchange, stressed that the Ex-
change is not limited solely to text
books, but that any type of book
may be brought in. He further ex-
plained that this exchange would
be a test run, so that weaknesses
in the system may be discovered
and ironed out for the Fall Ex-
change, when there will be more
students participating.

The Book Exchange will serve
three purposes, according to land.
It will aid students in disposing of
ould books, buying cheaper texts,
and supplementing ﬁnancially,
student activities funds and needy
students.
