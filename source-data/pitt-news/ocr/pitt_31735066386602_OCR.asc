Vandalism causes $2000 damage

By Jim Wechsler
Staff Writer

Approximately $2,000 in
damages was accrued during a
spree of vandalism Sunday
evening in which windows and
windshields were shattered.

“We’re doing a full investigation
into that right now,” said William
Brennan, director of public safety
and chief of the campus police.

Brennan said that campus
police responded to a 10:15 p.m.
report of vandalism on the 3900
block of Forbes Avenue. He said
that one windshield on each of
three cars parked on Forbes
Avenue had been caved in; a
window in Room 536 of the

University of Pittsburgh School
of Law building had been
shattered, and one window on
the exterior staircase connecting
the law school to the Forbes
Avenue catwalk had also been
destroyed.

Although the investigation is
not complete, Brennan said that
the damage was believed to have
been caused by shots fired from
a BB gun. He added that the
shots may have originated from a
room in TowerA that faces Forbes
Avenue. A searchlight was used
Sunday night to try to determine
from which room the shots may
have been fired.

Brennan said that three suspects
were to be interviewed yesterday,

but he could not be reached for
comment after the interviews
were scheduled to be held.

“The detectives are out now,”
Brennan said.

Jon Conlogue, assistant director
of the Office of Residence Life,
said that judicial action could be
taken by the university if the
perpetrators are determined to
be students of the University of
Pittsburgh.

In addition, the guilty party or
parties may be subject to criminal
prosecution, according to
Conlogue.

Conlogue noted that the owners
of the damaged vehicles would
also be entitled to file separate
charges.

fashion show and the talent show,” she said.
“At Gospel Night there was a major mishap,” she
said. “Some of the choirs didn’t show up.”

After more than a week of lectures, music and
social gatherings, Black Week ’90 wrapped up with
the annual fashion show, held in the William Pitt
Union Assembly Room.

“Afterwards you can always see slight
imperfections —— things that you could have
improved upon. But it went OK,” said Black Action
Society programming committee Chairperson Alicia
Smith.

Although a lot of members of Pittsburgh’s African
American community, including students from other
city universities, attended Black Week events,
Smith said there should have been a greater turnout
of Pitt students.

“I think there was a very sorry turnout of students,”
she said.

“There are a few changes that I would like to
make in terms of the structure of Gospel Night, the

Smith said she is working to incorporate Some of
God’s Children, Pitt’s gospel choir, into the planning
of next year’s Gospel Night. This year, Gospel Night
was coordinated by Clayton Walker.

“There were slight imperfections in the fashion
and talent Shows, but you can’t help that,” she said.

“African American Education for Mental
Liberation,” a lecture by scholar and author Na’im
Akbar, “went over very well,” she said. “The
Assembly Room was packed.”

Smith was also pleased with the Black Bazaar.

“I thought [Lisa Richardson] did very well with
that,” she said.

Richardson, who coordinated the bazaar, was
responsible for contacting area black merchants
and confirming their participation in the event,
which was held Wednesday, Nov. 7 in the Forbes

Concentration camp survivor says anotber Holocaust possible

By William Graves
Sta_[)“ Writer

Survivors of the Holocaust have
continued to send a message to
the world: Never forget, and never
let it happen again.

Three such survivors, Alfred
Lewin, Dora Iwler and Jack
Sittsamer, stressed that message
through a telling of their individual
stories to Dr. Barbara Burstin’s
class, America and the Holocaust.

Alfred Lewin started the class
by saying that before 1938, life in
his hometown in Germany was
relatively peaceful. However, on
Nov. 1, 1938, Lewin’s house was
robbed; the synagogues were
burned, and his father was
arrested. After having gained a
little schooling as a mechanic
and after working in a munitions
factory, Lewin was arrested
himself in 1943.

Lewin said that at that point,

. the Jews were not aware of their

eventual fate. “None of the

prisoners on the train to Auschwitz .

knew it was a prison camp,” said
Lewin.

Aric Buckholt/The Pitt ews

Dora Iwler speaks to a Pitt class, yesterday. At her left is Alfred Lewin and at her right is Jack Sittsamer.

Lewin said that he and the
other prisoners were separated.
“I went to the left side, which was
the side to live; the women and
children went to the right,” he
said.

After several weeks Lewin was

transported to another camp,
where he was brieﬂy reunited
with his father. However, in the
fall of 1945 Lewin was transported
to the Warsaw ghetto in Poland.

“At the ghetto I got a job pulling
gold teeth from Jews who had

died during the night. It was a
good job,” he said.

A few weeks later, Germany's
hold on Poland was being
threatened, so Lewin and many
others were forced to walk from
Warsaw to Dachau, a three—day

march during which Lewin and
the others were not given any
water. 9

“It is so hard to describe the
feeling of being denied something
to drink for three days. Even
today I take a glass of water to
bed because I never want to
experience that feeling again,”
said Lewin.

Lewin’s experience in the
Holocaust lasted until 1945. He
spent 198 days in concentration
camps and was liberated by a
U.S. army captain in 1945. He
had lost 28 family members by
1943.

Iwler feels that there is the
potential for another Holocaust
in these times.

“David Duke, a lKu Klux] Klan
member and a Nazi, nearly got‘.
elected to the Senate by promising
a better life. That is how Hitler
came to power,” said Iwler.

She went on to warn that Nazi
Germany was considered a
cultured and sophisticated
society, as are many powerful
societies today.

Coping on Campus...

Education and change can cure low self-esteem

way to start is to review and try to
understand those childhood
experiences that shaped your
current self-image. You might
require some counseling to work

Editors’ note: The following is a

column in a series entitled
, "Coping on Campus, ” published
bi-weekly Tuesdays in The Pitt
News.

Self-respect or self-esteem is
derived from a basic belief that
one is capable -of living well in
the world and is worthy of being
appreciated by others. If you have
this belief, life is likely to be
rewarding; without it, life can be
very disappointing.

Your view of yourself is in part
a result of early life experiences.
The way you were treated and
viewed by significant others in
your childhood affects the way
you see yourself today.

Your self-esteem, however, is
also affected by your present
behavior. If you cling to the
negative beliefs of your youth,
behave in self-destructive ways
and continue to either blame your
problems on internal traits that
you can’t change or on external
forces thatyou can’t control, then
your self-esteem will
progressively worsen.

The good news is that positive
self-esteem can be learned. One

 

Dr. Robert
Gallagher

through your anger toward
people in the past who you
believe contributed to your
negative self-view.

Beyond that, however, you
need to learn that much of your
low self-esteem is maintained

because you practice, on a daily
basis, your self-doubts and self-
criticism.

A number of research studies
have verified that people who
work at it can learn to replace
negative self—statements such as
"I’m “stupid,” a “fraud” and a
“loser,” with statements such as
“I’m a “survivor,” a “capable
person" and “an individual who
can succeed in spite of my past.”
If you visit the Counseling Center
Library, located in Room 554 in
the William Pitt Union, a secretary
can direct you to self—help books
that teach you how to use positive
self-affirmations and success
imagery to enhance your self-
view.

This deliberate focus on how
to feel better about yourself is
often necessary to get started
along the path toward self-esteem.
More significant breakthroughs
will occur, however, when you
are able to get away from constant
self—assessment and begin to look
more toward how you want to
live your life.

In the long run your self-
esteem is not going to come from

techniques you employ to feel
better about yourself. It is going
to grow from the choices you
make, from the risks you take,
from the caring you exhibit toward
others, and ultimately, from the
quality of life you lead.

In a sense, your self-esteem
will be at its highest when you
stop focusing on how good or
bad you are and focus instead on
finding a life direction that
challenges and inspires you, a
value system that defines you
and a social conscience that gives
meaning to your life.

This may sound a little
overwhelming, but you don’t
need to do all of this now. You
only need to know that it is

Goldstein finds fame and fortune 

By Lane Hornfeck
Sta_ﬂ‘ Writer

When Pitt Professor Donald
Goldstein was taking Gordon
Prange’s class as an
undergraduate at the University
of Merle in Virginia, Goldstein
used to fall asleep.

One day, however, Goldstein
said he woke-up and started to
listen to what Prange had to say.
He found that Prange was hired
by Gen. Douglas MacArthur to
research all of the events
surrounding and stemming from
World War II. This knowledge
would later have a great effect on
Goldstein’s life.

“Be kind to your professor; he
may make you rich someday,”
Goldstein said in his chalky
Virginian accent.

Gradually Prange took a liking
to Goldstein, and the two became
friends. After Goldstein graduated
from Merle and entered the U.S.
Air Force, he and Prange kept in
touch. Prange kept Goldstein
notified of his gradual process of
accumulating all of his ﬁndings
for a book he hoped to publish.
Prange was eventually awarded
a publishing contract from
McGraw Hill to write Dec. 7,
1941: The Day the Japanese
Attacked Pearl Harbor.

Year after year, Goldstein
received letters from Prange
telling of how he had only a “few
more chapters” left.

Finally Goldstein realized that
the book would never be finished.
A short time later, he received
word that Prange was dying, so
Goldstein immediately picked up
and left for Virginia.

Along with Katherine V. Dillon,
Goldstein took up the task of
putting the book together. In
1981 At Dawn We Slept was
published, only one year after
Gordon W. Prange died.

Although Prange was not alive
to see his dream come true,
Goldstein and Dillon went on to
publish four more books in his
name: Miracle atMidway, Target
Toleyo, The Verdict ofHr’sto1y and
Dec. 7, 1941. All books were

comprised of Prange’s 37 years of
study and research. At Dawn We
Sleptand Miracle atMidway have
both appeared on the New York
Tima best-seller list.

After 12 years of research on
their own, Goldstein and Dillon
have collaborated to write and
publish their latest book, God '5
Samurai. They also have a
seventh book on the way.

As he chewed on an unlit cigar,
Goldstein reflected on the appeal
and impact these books have had
on the public.

“They are about a war that
educated the country, integrated
blacks into the military and
changed the roles of women. It
was a good war; it changed
society,” he said with a big
Southern smile.

“The main reason why the
books sell is because they are
about people. Most students like
[the books] because they are so
easy to read and it tells them
about their past," Goldstein said.

Goldstein is a former lieutenant
colonel of the U.S. Air Force,
retired after 22 years of service.
He has been an associate
professor at Pitt’s Graduate School
of Public and International Affairs
for the past 13 years.

Goldstein teaches or has taught
GSPIA courses in public policy,
public affairs, international affairs
and international security. He now
serves as the coordinator for the

specialized certificate program in
Asian studies and in international ‘

security affairs.

Goldstein said that even after
all of his academic and writing
success, he still enjoys teaching
at Pitt.

“It's fun. I’m doing what I want
to do, and I like it,” he said.

Goldstein has a master of
science in both political science
and public administration, a
master of arts and bachelor of
arts in history and his Ph.D. in
history from Denver University.
He has taught nearly 20 different
courses here at Pitt and has also
taught at Carnegie Mellon,
Duquesne University, Troy State

Dorm residents pick furniture

By Renee Crespy
Staﬂ“ Writer

Students living in Lothrop Hall should get
ready to rearrange their rooms, because ﬁnances
permitting, all the rooms will be getting new
furniture.

Last week in the Tower A lobby Support
Services set up displays of dorm furniture and
invited students to vote on what they liked and
to give their opinions on the type of fur-niture
that would be most comfortable and useful.

Hal Lavin, general manager for Support
Services, said, “We wanted students’ opinions,
and after Thanksgiving we’ll have an idea what
kind of furniture to get. We have seven different
companies representing furniture, so we have a
large selection to choose from.”

“Students seemed to like a particular chair
that had two positions, and they showed concern
about the height of shelves on the desks and

what the headboards should look like,” said
Lavin.

“The new furniture will be just in Lothrop Hall.
We haven’t had a furniture change there for a
while, so we would like to do this, but we might
not be able to do the entire hall because of
finances. We generate revenues from the housing
office, and we have various functions, so we
hope to have enough to do this,” said Lavin.

“Depending on the budget we might get new
beds, bookcases, desk Carrels, dressers, desk
chairs and an easy chair or sofa," said Lavin.

Student Matt Zatko said he liked the fact that
students got to pick the furniture.

“I thought the furniture was cool. I live in the
Towers, and the stuff in there is good — it’s
stackable... but that furniture was nice too,"
Zatko said.

"It was a good idea letting the students be part
of the selection process. After all, they are the
ones that have to live there,” he said.

RSC elects new board

By Maureen Dorney
For The Pitt News

The Representative Student
Committee elected its executive
board last week and had guest
speaker Brent Saunders in the
“hot seat.”

Saunders represented the
Student Government Board and
lent his support to RSC. “I’m very
supportive of the RSC. I want to
ensure that their voice is heard in
the SGB," he said.

As part of his campaign platform
of being “accountable to the
people," Saunders discussed the
possible creation of a student
affairs committee.

Kurt Stark, newly elected RSC
vice chairperson, wants the board
to actually become a committee

prisoner,” said Coopie.

The letters that were written
that night totaled 205.

The letters that were written
will go to government officials,
police captains and in some cases,
ambassadors of that particular
country.

Among the 10 cases that
spanned the globe, one resided
in our own backyard: Nebraska,

, Vendors unaffected

By Curtis Chan

For The Pitt News

The performance and the record of the
Pitt football team do not seem to have
affected the sales of Pitt merchandise, said

4, local vendors.

“Actually, [Pitt’s performance] doesn’t
seem to affect our business too much.
Business is about the same. The students
and alumni don’t generally care whether
the team’s winning or losing when they’re
buying merchandise. They just want
something with ‘Pitt’ on it,” said Lee
Carnahan, manager of Shea Sports.

Carnahan said that Shea Sports attempts
to stock a variety of Pitt—related clothing
because he sees many customers returning
to the store. Many of those patrons are
students or alumni who purchase items
throughout the week but especially on

Holocaust

“These Nazis had wives and children.

'9 They went to church; they prayed, and

they killed,” said Iwler.

Like Lewin, lwler was taken from her
home in Poland to a concentration camp
when she was just a child. There she was
assigned to digging vegetables for the
Nazis. She thought about escaping many
times.

According to Iwler, “One day in the
fields, the guards were not watching me,

‘C. and I slipped away in the tall weeds and

went back to my hometown.”

There she told people that she was a
Christian and was able to get a job.
However, an old friend of Iw1er’s spotted
her and reported her to an S.S. officer.

game days, he said.

“We haven’t found any cut in our sales,
but we went out of our way to make sure
we had everything,” said Tom Sabol, co-
owner of Your Campus Store.

Sabol said he has not seen wildly ﬂu-
ctuating sales levels due to how the Panther
football team does from year to year.

“The sales will vary, depending upon
lPitt’sl opponent, [which] bears directly on
the attendance,” said Dennis Crovella, the
manager/buyer for the Pitt Store. Crovella
said that the bulk ofthe merchandise sold
by the Pitt Store is non-football items.

“I don’t think the students buy on the
basis of the football team,” said Crovella.

Though Pitt-merchandise sales around
the area have not undergone any drastic
changes, changes in the morale of Panther
fans are becoming more evident, as the
football team currently has a 3-6-1 record.

lwler said, “She was my friend, and she
told on me. I learned then that I could not
confide in anyone.”

Iwler was then sent back to the same
camp from which she had escaped. But
she did not stay there for long.

“The Russians were already coming,
and we were made to walk 40 or 50
kilometers deeper into Poland.” It was
after this march that Iwler was liberated by
Russian soldiers.

For the students in the class, lwler tried
to provide some insight into her experience.

“Concentration—camp life cannot be
described or understood on a day-to-day
basis. The pain must be understood hour
by hour,” she said.

lwler later found that she was the only

by Panthers’ record

“It’s a little discouraging in the fact that
they haven’t won, but we get enough
people in here," said Sabol. “I haven’t
heard anything about Pitt. Maybe there’s
not enough spirit."

Carnahan said that the majority of the
students he has seen are somewhat
apathetic about the Panther football team
in comparison to years past.

“I don’t think the students care one way
or another. The alumni seem to be more
angered about [Pitt’s losses] than the
students are. There just isn’t the following
like there used to be,” said Carnahan.

“Whether the team’s playing well or not,
they have the support of the alumni and
students. It’s the people from outside the
university who would show more support
for the winner. l’ll see many of the alumni
back on Friday and Saturday before and
after the games,” said Crovella.

survivor in her family. She was victimized
for six years and said that she did not want
it to happen again.

“There is so much hate and racism out
there today that I feel my story must be
told,” she said.

The last to speak wasjack Sittsamer. He
was born in Poland and is the only living
member of his extended family. When he
was 14, his small town was burned, and
the people were taken away to work.

“The Germans were trying to make all
Polish towns Jew-free,” said Sittsamer.

He was one of the first 100 workers at a
Messerschmidt airplane factory that would
eventually have 3,000 workers. At the
beginning of 1944 the Germans had to

Sittsamer stayed until May S, 1945. That
was when he saw the Americans coming.

“I was so happy that they came when
they did. I only weighed 70 pounds, and
if they had come a few days later, I would
not be here now,” said Sittsamer.

When asked if resistance was possible
during their capture, Sittsamer said, “In
the camps there was no resistance at all.”

According to "Lewin, it was impossible to
fight as an individual, but “as a group, like

in the Warsaw ghetto, there was a strong 

effort to resist.”

lwler said, “There was nowhere to go.
No help came, but I fought for my life. I
lied, and I survived; that was resistance.”

BAS talees a stand. ..

As the University of Pittsburgh sits down to select a new
president, one student group has started another campaign
to get more student representation on the presidential-
search committee.

Last week, the Black Action Society demanded more

* representation for their group.’ The group said that three
people selected by the BAS, along with ' student
representative Lisa Campoli, should be admitted to the
committee in order to ensure that its members’ needs are
considered.

Furthermore, the BAS asked that a representative of the
committee respond to its demands by tomorrow at noon,
or “the chances of solving this problem orderly and

N peacefully will decline drastically.”

There is no doubt that the presidential—search committee
is sorely lacking in student representation with only one
undergraduate representative serving. Unfortunately, until
now nobody has done very much to increase this number.

Student Government Board President Julie Shepard
protested Board of Trustees’ Chairperson john Marous’
decision for only one student on the committee. After a
simple letter to Marous, however, the effort was dropped
with little complaint. Because of this, the BAS made their
concerns known.

Citing the lack of action by the SGB, the BAS took
matters into its own hands. We support the decision to
demand more representation. It shows that some students
on this campus are not accepting the mistaken decision
of John Marous. J

Students groups should take a valuable lesson from the
BAS. They should demand representation for their own
“i groups and their own concerns. If enough groups try this,

then students will have a better chance of being represented
more fairly. '

But students who have no allegiances to any particular
group can still express their feelings on this important
subject. We encourage students to protest Marous’ lack of
concern for student representation. We ask that students
show their disapproval by calling President Marous at

"5. 624-3176. They can also write a letter to Marous at this
address:

A

Chairperson John Marous

Pittsburgh, PA 15260

‘L’ If students ﬂood Marous’ office with mail, he may finally
acknowledge that students are a part of this campus and
should be fairly represented on the presidential—search
committee.

We, the undersigned residents
of Lothrop Hall, are very dis-
satisfied with the handling of the
current missing—key situation.

For the money we pay to live in
the Pitt residence halls, our se-
curity should be unconditionally
guaranteed. We believe that there
have been multiple ﬂaws in the
way the university has attempted,
or rather failed to attempt, to
resolve this pressing problem.

Firstly, the university made the
mistake of not informing any
residents that the key is missing.
Each resident assistant should
have been briefed, and they in
turn should have been required
to inform the residents for whom
they are responsible. Instead,
some RAs found out about this
through The Pitt News, others
through a news brief on WTAE-
TV. Finding out about such a
serious threat through outside
sources has left us doubting the
best intentions of those who are
in positions of responsibility in
the Pitt residence halls.

We are wondering why, in the
interest of our security, all the
locks in Lothrop Hall were not
immediately changed. At this
point, even if the key is recovered,
the person who took it has had
ample time to make one or more

_ copies. With the Thanksgiving

recess approaching, we are be-
coming increasingly concerned
that we will return to Lothrop to
find our valuables stolen and our
rooms ransacked.

The only reasonable solution
to the problem is to change every
lock in the building as soon as
possible. Once the locks have

- been changed, a new, safe place

should be found for the master
key.

The following important que-
stions remain unanswered:

1. Why was the key kept in a
place where there was any chance
of its being stolen?

2. Why was the key left un-
attended long enough for some-
one to take it?

Lothrop students voice concerns

3. Why were no residents, not
even the resident assistants, in-
formed of the situation?

4. Why were the locks not
immediately changed when there
was the slightest possibility that
the master key was at large?

5. Why have more break-ins
been allowed to occur since the
discovery of the missing key?

WE DEMAND ANSWERS!’ ”

In response to the letter by Mr.

Letters

Pittsburgh electricians’ union, I
would like to extend an apology
on behalf of both my brother,
Tom, and the Panther Pistol and
Riﬂe Club. I can assure Mr. O’Kain
and his fellow electricians that no
one from our club ever made the
comments reported by Leo Hoh.

On the day that Hoh inter-
viewed Tom, I was standing less
than 2 feet from my brother and
was able to hear the entire
conversation. T om explained to

Mr. Hoh that after speaking with _

the assistant vice president for
Student Affairs, Dennis Donham,
he was told that he expected no
problems with re—opening the
range at Trees Hall, but that if
there were, by some remote
chance, any problems, they would
most likely arise from the union
contract My brother‘ then was
asked why the union would
object, and he told Mr. Hoh that
possibly its members may be
concerned with losing their job
to an outside contractor. He did
not say that they were “worried
about getting a piece of money.”

Hopefully, the next time The

Pitt News and Mr. Hoh wish to
write about something, they will
choose to do the entire story
instead of just a morsel of it in a
pathetic attempt to stir up trouble
where none exists.

Not everyone is political

In his editorial of Nov. 14,
1990, Rob Lewis references,
unknowinglyl assume, the central
question of political philosophy:
What does one do to change the
world—attempt to change others,
or attempt to change oneself? All
political activity (or inactivity)
stems, directly or indirectly, from
this question. In the 17th century
people started coming to North
America because they were tired
of other people trying to change
them. Apparently, Lewis is here

"for other reasons.

Lewis needs to descend from
his mountain of worthy causes
and realize that just because any
one individual isn’t a political
groupie or doesn’t adorn himself
with placards at every
opportunity, that individual’s
“petty interests" aren’t any less
important than Lewis’. If he
doesn’t want to come down off
his mountain, then he should just
stop talking and enjoy the. view.
Look at it this way, Rob: It’s our
loss. [...l L

Lewis says that his political

experience has so inspired him.

that he will be changing his major
next term “from biochemistry to
political science and economics. "

I'm happy for you, Rob, really I’

am. But look at it this way, if

everyone was this inspired, and -

everyone majored in political
science and economics, there
would be no one with “petty
interests" for you to enlighten.

Lady Panthers capture third straight Big Ea

By Ryan Buncher
Staff Writer

The Pitt‘, volleyball team won
its third straight Big East title last
weekend, becoming the first team
ever to win three in a row. In
doing so the 19th-ranked Lady
Panthers earned an automatic
bid to the NCAA Tournament
while raising their record to 31-5.

Pitt defeated Georgetown (28-
14), which upset second seed
Syracuse, three games to two in
the I championship game on
Sunday.

It marked the first time a Big
East opponent had taken the
Lady Panthers, who did not lose
a Big East match this season, to a
fifth game. The scoring was 15-6,
11-15, 15-4, 1315, 15-5. The
teams’ kill percentages reﬂected
the closeness of the match, with
Pitt’s .299 beating Georgetown’s
.233.

Freshman outside hitter Ann
Marie Lucanie seemed to ﬁnally
be back at full strength from an
ankle injury that kept her out
much of the season.

Lucanie led the team in kills
with 24 to go along with 12 digs
and a .355 kill percentage. Junior
middle blocker Dee MacAuley
was tops in digs with 21 and
second in kills with 19.

The Lady Panthers needed only
three games to defeat Seton Hall
(27-10) in the semifinals, by scores
of 15-8, 156 15-11. Seton Hall
actually had a better hitting

percentage, .194 compared to
only .123 for Pitt, and outdug the
Lady Panthers 46 to 30. The Seton
Hall Pirates fell apart in their
earlier meeting with Pitt, but had
only eight hitting errors in the
match. Pitt compensated with 14
more kills and fewer service
errors.

Lucanie was tops in kills with
11, digs with eight and kill
percentage with .389.

Villanova (18-18), which did
not win a Big East match this
season and gave Pitt very little
trouble in its match earlier this
season, took the Lady Panthers to
four games in the quarterfinals.
After Pitt won the first game 15-
6, the Wildcats came back to win
the second game 15-9. Pitt took
control of the match at that point,
winning the last two games by
scores of 15-3 and 15-0. Pitt’s kill
percentage was .294 compared
to .163 for Villanova but was
outdug by the Wildcats, 56-41.

Senior co—captain Michele
Adamson was tops on the team
in kills with 12, with a .454 kill
percentage. Pitt’s other statistical
leaders were MacAuley in digs
with 10 and Lucanie in kill
percentage with .583.

PITI‘ BITS: Pitt’s senior co-
captains, Adamson and Jenelle
Lantagne, were both named to
the Big East all—conference team,
with Lantagne being named Big
East Player of the Year. Sue
Woodstra was also named Big
East Coach of the Year.

Gymnasts come home from Annapolis with title

By Sharon Kerestes
Sta_[7‘W1~iter

Each year at this time, the men’s
gymnastics team heads down to the Naval
Academy in Annapolis, Md., for the Metro
Invitational, a kind of pre-test for the
upcoming season.

Each year, based on its performance the
team is able to evaluate its strengths and
weaknesses and see where it stands against
other teams.

But this past Saturday, things were a
little different. For the first time in years,
Pitt came away with the team title.

The Panthers scored 256.3 points to
defeat Navy (253.85), William and Mary
(253.1), Army (245.3), Radford (232.15),

Pitt swim

Cortland -State (230.4) and James Madison
(215.5).

“We weren’t real worried about
everybody else, going into the meet,” said
assistant coach Pat Pollaci. “We were
more concerned with trying to get scores
to see where we stand.”

Pitt scored 11 points higher than it did
last year at the same meet, where it
finished fourth.

Pollaci said that although Pitt’s overall
score was good, it could’ve been better.
The team’s goal for this meet was to break
260. Last year Navy won the meet with 266
points. ‘

Breaks and falls on certain events and
just plain old first—meet jitters kept the
Panthers from scoring as high as they felt

they could have.

But despite some problems, Pollaci noted
the positive aspects of this meet that
helped them win.

“The nucleus of our team stuck together,”
he said. “If one person had a problem on
an event, then the others picked it up so
that as a team, we did OK on each event.

“But there’s more room for
improvement," he said. “There’s always
more to do.”

One reason for downplaying this victory
is because the team has set higher goals
for itself than it has in the past. The
Panthers have set their sights on the NCAA
regional meet held at Penn State in late
winter. The regional meet is a qualifying
meet for nationals, and to get there, Pitt’s

top three team scores will be averaged
together and compared to others in the
region. The teams with the highest scores
in the region will advance.

Because of these higher goals, the team
is already feeling the pressure, said Pollaci.

“We started off with a good score, and
we know we have the capability to get
there,” Pollaci said. “But we have a long
road and a long season ahead of us. We’re
going to have to work on our difficulty
and work on keeping everybody together.”

Pitt’s Jorge Gonzalez scored 9.45 and
placed second on the floor exercise. He
scored a 9.25 and tied for second on vault
with teammate Genaro Severino, a
sophomore transfer from Northern Illinois.

ready to defend its reputation as
Big East Champions but came up
bruised with a 139-101 beating at
the hands of the University of
Virginia Cavaliers on Saturday.

“We got shellacked,” said
assistant coach Mark Davin. “They
kept taking it to us. I thought we
would be more ready.”

Virginia won the first five
events, placing swimmers in the
top five scoring slots to run away
from a Panther team that just

could not catch up.

In most of the races the
Cavaliers won, they dominated
from beginning to end. Panther
distance freestyler David
Schepner hung close but placed
second to 1,000—meter freestyle
winner Bill Smyth of Virginia.
Most of the other races were not
as close.

Smyth, the star of the meet,
swam in the 500 free and the 200
free, winning both events as well.

“I expected us to win a few
more races," said Coach Mike
Kozlina. “We took it right on the
nose.” .

The Panthers just could not
keep up with the Virginia
swimmers, bringing up the rear
in nearly every event except the
sprint-freestyle events.

Pitt co-captainJoe Kozlina won
the 100 free with a time of46.86,
out-sprinting Virginia’s Mike
Morgan to the wall. David
Dodson, Matthew Porter, and an
injured Eric Cornell placed third,
fourth and sixth, respectively, in
one of the few events in which
Pitt swam well.

Kozlina helped lead the
Panthers to victory in the final

event, the 400-free relay. Hedovme 

into the water, with Pitt and
Virginia being very close. But on
the last lap, he pulled away,
assuring Pitt of victory, and
claiming a little respect from the
Cavaliers.

The Virginia swimmers were a
very loud crowd. They chanted
and cheered before the start of
nearly every event, despite
repeated warnings to be silent by
the starter. According to Coach
Kozlina, Virginia’s strategy to gain
a psychological edge was not a
factor.

“It was not a factor,” he said.

 (“We tried to do a few cheers here

swimming do the talking.”

In one of the few bright’

moments for Pitt, senior John
Sharkey, despite his ankle injury,
won the 1-meter diving event.

“Considering he was injured,
Sharkey dove very well,’’ said
head coach Chuck Knoles. J

Bordeau displayed Pitt’s diving.

Wright leads his own

Version of ‘Dog Pound’

By Jeffrey Shurilla
For The Pitt News

Cleveland Browns fans are
known to yelp and bark and
have been tagged the “Dog
Pound.” Pitt fans aren’t near
that wild, but some of the
players are.

Linebacker Prentiss Wright
has trained the rowdy
defensive players into
becoming the “Dawgs.”

Wright is their master, who

has taken the responsibility of

trying to get the 36-1 Pitt
football team and fans excited
about Saturday’s game at Penn
State. The 5—foot-10, 212-pound
senior brought the Dawgs with
him from his high school in
Orlando, Fla.

“I thought he was crazy,”
said nose guard Richard Allen,
thinking back to when he and
Wright were roommates their
freshman year.

“At summer camp in 80- and
90-degree heat, we're all dying
out there, and Prentiss is out
there barking, ‘Wooﬂ Woofl
C’mon Dawgs! Where are my

Dawgs?”’

“I’m thinking, ‘Oh my God!
What have I gotten myself
into? This guy’s crazy,” Allen
added.

If you watchlNo. 7 for Pitt,
you know he is having fun.
Before a kickoff he waves a
white towel, trying to draw
the fans into the game.

After making a nice hit or
tackle, he pops up from the
pile and salutes the crowd.
During one play this year he
celebrated by tackling a
teammate who had returned
an interception for a
touchdown.

All this enthusiasm comes
while slapping helmets and
calling for the Dawgs.

“It’s a way of getting my
teammates up,” said Wright.
“It gets them to concentrate on
the game and get emotionally
involved. It’s a way of getting
the crowd into the game —— to
enjoy the game.”

Wright, better known as “Big
P,” has come a long way since
beginning his career at Pitt as

“This was a good meet to show

us where we stand and where we
need to go,” Gonzalez said. “It
gives us a chance to restructure
our workouts.

“There were a lot of teams

there, so we had a chance to see
what everybody else’s difficulty
level was, and ours was better for
the most part," he said.

Gonzalez and Severino were
among those competing to qualify

Saturday for the United States
Winter Nationals meet on Dec. 6.
Scores for optionals and
compulsories are combined to
decide who will advance, but as
of yet the qualiﬁers haven’t been
determined. ’

1 9 THE PITI‘ NEWS,Tuesday, November 20, 1990
Toronto ’s trade practices baﬁlmg on surface ana’ beneath ,

On Saturday night, Tony
Granato scored 52 seconds into
overtime to lift the Los Angeles
Kings to a 2-1 victory over the
Pittsburgh Penguins in a brilliantly
played hockey game. The Pens
finished up a successful road trip
at 2-1~1 and now own a 10-8-2
mark on the young season.

What could have been an
unbelievable road trip was
smashed when Cranato picked
up a loose puck, skated in and
beat Frank Pietrangelo low to
give the Kings the win. The Pens
again played solid stand—up
defense and have now allowed
three goals or less in seven of
their last 11 outings.

The offense struggled in L.A.
minus lea gue-leading scorerjohn

Cullen, who sat out with a pulled
stomach muscle. Cullen’s line-
mates Kevin Stevens and Mark
Recchi struggled, and Muskegeon
recall Brad Aitken didn’t show
much, as he was benched most
of the second and third periods.
The Penguins continue to get
spectacular goaltending from both
Pietrangelo and Tom Barrasso,
and Coach Bob Johnson is now
forced into the kind of decisions
coaches like to make: who to
start in goal with two net—minders
playing well. The Pens return
home to face the Philadelphia
Flyers on Wednesday and then
will engage in a home series with
the struggling Washington
Capitals over the weekend.
Last season the Toronto Maple

Atlantic Coast Conference, is
one of the best teams in the
country and taught the
Panthers a valuable lesson
about swimming on a higher
competitive level. Coach
Knoles was disappointed with
his team’s effort.

“Are we going to swim faster
later?” he said. “That is the big
question. Virginia is on the
level that we want to be at.”

“If we don’t swim against
teams on Virginia’s level, we
will never get there. Right now,
we are three swimmers short

being competitive with
Virginia.”

The Panthers will see two
more ACC teams on Nov. 29,
when Pitt hosts its own
invitational meet. North
Carolina State, Maryland (of
the ACC), Howard, Bowling
Green and St. Bonaventure
will visit Trees Pool for the
meet.

“ACC teams will give us
trouble,” Knoles said. “As a
first year head coach here at
Pitt there are no freebies.
You’ve got to work for
everything you get.”

Leafs played .500 hockey and
were eliminated in the first round
of the playoffs. The Leafs also
allowed the third—most goals in
the league last year, so man-
agement laid low in the off-

Berger

season, hoping they could simply
outscore every team they faced
this year.

Well, 22 games into the season
the Leafs are as bad as Quebec,
and they are panicking. Toronto
is 4-17-1 and has given up a
staggering total of 107 goals. Now
everyone in Toronto is on the

trading block, and the Leafs have
started to ship goods. In the last
week (weak) Toronto has
unloaded high-flying Eddie
Olcyzk and rugged winger Mark
Osborne to Winnipeg for high-
scoring defensemen Dave Ellett
and Paul Fenton. Then the Leafs
sent a former first-round pick
and a pair of draft choices to
Quebec for two 50+—year—old
wingers, Lucien Deblois and
Aaron Broten, and defenseman
Michel Petit.

Essentially, Toronto gave up a
lot ofyoung talent for some good
players, but what the team really
needed was defensive help and a
goaltender. Why would the Leafs
bother picking up Ellett, who is a
tremendous offensive defense-

man, and Petit, who the New
York Rangers shipped off to make
room for better defensive—minded
blue—liners? The Leafs already
have Al Iafrate (21 goals last year)
and Tom Kurvers (52 points last
season) to head the power play.
With the young talent and draft
picks the Leafs have been
shopping around for, Toronto
should have easily been able to
pick up some defensemen who
know how to back-check and a
goaltender. Toronto is in sham-
bles and making trades in an
attempt to save face. At the present
time, every move Toronto has‘?
made and hasn’t made looks
shabby. Only time will tell, but
for now, look for more baffling
things to come out of Toronto.

Wright

Continued from page 9
a fullback. He’s started all 10
games this year at inside
linebacker and is third on the
team in tackles with 53.

His best game came this year
against Notre Dame, for which he
was named to the ECAC honor
roll. He led all players with 10
tackles and had an interception.

“P is the catalyst for our team;
he gets things going,” said Allen.
“There’s not enough enthusiasm
like his around; he’s a motivator.
That’s what keeps him going.
He's had a good four years here.”

Not everyone on the team looks
favorably toward Wright’s actions,

however.

“I don’t admire that style,” said
assistant head coach and
defensive coordinator Fred
vonAppen. “It isn’t like I’m a
virgin when it comes to being
associated with championship
caliber teams.

“The great teams I’ve been
around don’t do that. Some do it,
and it’s wonderful for them. I
don’t think it has a place in sport
to upstage your opPQ>nent,” he
said.

VonAppen was an assistant
under Bill Walsh when the San
Francisco 49ers won the Super
Bowl in 1985.

“If you’re going to play that
way, you better back it up with ‘

solid, consistent play. Clearly we “I

haven’t done that. And we haven’t
felt as though that has added
much to our game at all,” he said.

Wright is hoping to be drafted
this spring as a defensive back in
the NFL. If not, he may pursue the
new World Football League.

But wherever he goes, the
Dawgs will follow. V

“I’m taking everything with me,” 'l
Wright said. “I’ll be the same
Prentiss Wright. I’ll never change;
my style never changes. This is
me, and people are going to have
to accept me the way I am.”
