this summer to review our
policies regarding its recom-
mendations. Since that time,
University officials ‘have been
reviewing the Book Center’s ﬁ-
nancial picture to determine how
the recommendations might be
implemented to the maximum
extent. In doing (so, they were
constrained by the fact that no

0 budget provision has been made

in the current ﬁscal year for a
reduction in Book Center in-
come and that the University al-
ready faces serious problems be-
cause of the delay of the ‘Com-
monwealth in providing the ap-
propriation for the University.

The essential recommendation
made by the committee is that
the Book. Center should conduct
its operations on a non-proﬁt
basis and price its materials ac-
cordingly. The University ac-
cepts that principle fully and

he s initiated studies which would
lead to the Book Center’s opera-
tion on that basis next year,
with appropriate downward ad-
Justments in prices. This should
mean some savings to all of the
Book Center’s customers.
However, rather than waiting
until this store-wide policy can
be inaugurated, the Book Cen-
ter will initiate in the winter
term this year a 10 per cent re-
duction on required hard-cover
textbooks for all University stu-
cents. The reduction cannot be

‘extended to soft-covered texts

which prices are ﬁxed by the
manufacturer, but these texts
normally cost only a fraction of
those bound in hard covers and
their purchase should be less of
a hardship for any student.

I realize that some students
had hoped for an across-the
board discount effective with the
start of this term. It must be

UNiV§'RSlTY

 

pointed out, however, that any
reduction in Book Center charges
this year is a risk for the Uni-
versity.

In recommending that the
Book Center aim at a break-even
position, the special committee
‘acknowledged that the store pro-
duced less operating income than
its operating expenses over the
past ﬁve years, but felt that this
situation was beginning to
change. So it was largely, on the
basis of a hope for future proﬁt-
ability, rather -than actual proﬁt-
ability, that the committee made
its’ recommendations. Regretably,
our ﬁnancial management data
is not yet accurate enough to
permit identiﬁcation of all costs
involved in operating the store,

' and the many direct and indirect

costs associated with book sales
likely will make the concept of
a “proﬁt" highly illusory in any
case.

   

A 10 per cent discount may

‘ seem a modest ﬁgure to a pur-

chaser, but when an establ.ish- .

ment is operating on a narrow. - ._

margin between publishers’

charges and sales prices, as our “ "

Book Center is obliged to do,
the effect of a discount is far’
greater than it seems. A 10 per

cent reduction in the student. 

price of all textbooks, if imple-
mented throughout this entire
year, would cut the amount of
money available for the Book

Center’s operations — i.e., sal- J__

aries, overhead costs, mainten-

ance, etc. —— approximately in " A

half, an effect which could -be
catastrophic in any enterprise.- V

And, as I pointed out, since  ,4;
already are operating in the per-, ' . ,
iod of the budget for the ﬁscal  
year 1967-68, the University real-V ‘V _

ly does not have the option of]

introducing a discount at once 1 .

     SLA Academic Guidelines Gem Hershey T0 Speak 
On Draft Deferments -     

UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

  For Faculty And Students  

by ANNE DORN _
The School of the Liberal
Arts (SLA) has developed
a system of guidelines for
E   academic integrity. Dean
 A. Kehl of the SLA
' emphasized the word “guide-
lines.” He stated that the
system is “not a policy,” but
guidelines that he hopes the
faéulty and students will follow.
_p_\.ﬁ;'»’I‘f the st-udents know what is
expected, they Will do their best
to comply.” ’ .
(The Academic Integrity Guide-
lines are printed on page 22.)
Dean Kehl noted that the “stu-

When under pressure, he is like-

but was too loosely" stated.” Now
the SLA has “presented the
guidelines in a functional state-

The Guidelines were formu-

member of the Council, forsees
“no problem” with the Guide-

New Curriculum

Hoelscher Cites Change

The School of Engineer-
ing has established a new
undergraduate program of
studies, resulting from a
two year intensive evalua-
tion of the latest curriculum.

T-he new program will depart
from the traditional program in
two signiﬁcant ways. The change
involves a common study pro-
gram for the ﬁrst four terms
and a selected ﬁeld of concen-
tration chosen in the sophomore
year for the remaining terms.

Traditionally, engineering stu-
dents were required to choose
a specialty within the ﬁeld such
as electrical, industrial or metal-
lurgical engineering, early in
their initial college program. Un-
der the new curriculum, all en-
gineering -students will follow a
common program for _most of
their ﬁrst four terms "designed
to provide them with a strong
foundation in ' seven subjects
which are fundamental to all 6111
gineering. During the ﬁnal two
years the student will follow a
special area of concentration and
will have increasing ﬂexibilty in
choosing non-technical and tech‘-
nical elective courses. Upon com-
pletion of his eight term pro-
gram, the engineering graduate

0 will receive the Bachelor of,Sci-

ence with an area or subject of

rn-E:PIT'rr‘NEWs

‘ - by DAN LICHTENSTEIN
 It’s almost impossible not
{to take a newspaper for
granted.‘ You can find one
anywhere for a few cents,
‘flip to the sports section and
glance at-the baseball scores,
then use it to swat ﬂies. But
"anyone who has worked on a
paper and learned to appreciate
-the complexities of publishing a
daily jornal will never again
smash a moth wi-th quite the
‘same irreverance.

 I worked on the New York
Times this_ summer, and it still
‘mazes me how such a vast,
complicated, million dollar op-
eration can be coordinated in-to
ﬁ..simple newspaper ﬁve times a
day. The average reader gen-
‘ era-lly glances through only one
‘copy in the morning, though the
_:four main editions of the Times
. totals over 900,000 copie_s"'every
gday. Few average readers real-
Vize that the bulk of this work
‘is done at night between 6 p.m.
'and,3:30 a.m.

The basic operation sounds
ifs-irriple. The reporters are as-
T signed stories and hand in most
 cases by 6 o'clock. The copy is
fthen edited and corrected then
.1 sent to the printer.

 iThe reporters are hardly the
only source of news copy. Lit-
erally hundreds of feature
C tories, bulletin, anecdotes and
peeialized stories including food,
ashion, etc. are received on tele-
type machines almost 24 hours
day. Each one of these wire
rvice stories must‘ be cate-
,ro_ri'zed, edited or thrown out,
then fitted into the paper. In ad-
dition, the '1‘uimes has -separate
machines which receive radio
"reports and simultaneously make
what look like regular 45 rpm
records. These radio messages
._‘generally come from foreign or
“national correspondents are al-
~ ways used in the day’s editions.

All three news sources: re-
porters, wire service copy, and
-radio messages are often com-
._bined into the same story. Sort-
__ing, combining and correcting
he copy from the various

eaders. Only a basic skeleton
taff of copy readers work dur-
ng. the. day on early stories and
"the Sunday edition. The major-
of the copy reading staff ar-
rr_ives‘:“-at the office at 6 pm. and
ork like mad‘ until 1 a.m. Di-
vided into four main desks, for-
__eign, national, local and society-

rect typing and printing errors,
‘grammar mistakes and story or-
ganization before writing head-

 

ources is the job for the copy -

Lichtenstein Works for NY ‘Times’

lines. Compare this job to cor-
recting hundreds of freshman
English papers at three dead-
lines per night.

Copy reading sounds like a
long unrewarding job and it is.
Not many journalists are con-
tent to stay at desks moving
other people's commas around

for two many years. ‘The de- ,

mand for competent copy read-
ers is great, but unfortunately
the pay isn't. A

The corrections are run off in
the composing room, then sent
back to the readers for-still more

corrections. After the 9 o'clock,

deadline, the news room is fair-
ly quiet until the first edition
comes up at 10. Whatever mis-
takes still remain in that edi-
tion are there to stay, but three
m.ore edition will come out be-
fore 3:30, so the whole process
starts over. Stories are added,
removed, moved to different
pages while the incessant edit-
ing and correcting continue.
All the while, latest bulletins
and new stories never cease to
pour into the office. Of course,
every important new story or
new addition must be used.
Every big city newspaper bases
its circulation and advertising
appealon its ability to come out
with the ‘big stories at least at
the same time as its competitors.
This summer, the Mid East
war broke out at almost exactly
3 a.m. EST. All but one editor
had long since gone to bed. Only
two copy readers remained at
each desk-and only the barest

skeleton staff remained in the ,

composing room to run off a
few pages for thenext day.

It these few people had de-
cided they were tired and it was
too late to change the entire pa-
per to accommodate a full war,
the New York Times would have
sold very few copies the next
day. Every New Yorker would
have brought the Daily News to
learn about the Israeli victories.

Finally by 5 a.m., no more
than 20 individuals in the news
room had turned out an entire-
ly different paper from the ear-
lier editions.

I ‘often wondered what that
office must have been like the
day Kennedy was assassinated.
Actually, since the tragedy oc-
cured in the afternoon, all dead-
lines were met and the paper
came out on time. But I was
often assured that it had been,
“. . . quite a day.”

A big news break such as the
Mid East war can sometimes be
anticipated. During the race riots
this summer, there were still
plenty of people’ working in the

Stories on new casualty and des-
truction ﬁgures, new riot break
outs in cities all over the coun-
try and new statements by num-
erous mayors and the President

utes. Every new break had to be
placed and, of course, corrected.
The New York Times and prob-
ably every other big city paper
was operating and gathering
news and constantly correcting
their stories until the last shot
was fired in each riot this sum-
mer. Any’ large paper that does
not work so diligently will go
out of business within days.
The identical process operates
for each section of the paper
every night: local, national, for-
eign, sports, education, ﬁn-ancial,
Etc. At the same time, almost
the entire Sunday editiongis com-
pleted by early Thursday night.
Almost everything can be au-

 Receives Grant 

For Science Studies

The University has received a
$303,000 grant from -the Nation-
al Institutes of Health for train-
ing and research in the neuro-
biological sciences. Principal ad-
ministrators of the grant are
Dr. Alan Fisher, professor of
psychology, and Dr. Gerhard
Werner, professor and chairman
of the Department of Pharma-
cology in the School of Medi-
cine.

‘ The initial award will cover a
four-year training program with
about half of the money used
for stipends to pre-doctoral and
post-doctoral fellows and the
other half used for faculty, fa-

cilities, technical_personnel,
equipment, and visiting speak--

ers.

The program will involve three
departments, those of psycholo-
gy andbiology in the natural
sciences, and pharmacology in
medicine, and will emphasize

page paper with every comma
and word ﬁtted exactly into the
allo-ted columns. The New York
Times and every other big city
newspaper is an incredibly com-
plex million dollar operation
that often ends up being used
to house train a dog" or kill a
moth.

Dr. Broussard Heads
Mental Hea1thProgram

The Graduate School of
Public Health (GSPH) has
named Dr. Elsie R. Brous-
sard as director of a new
Program in community men-
tal health.

In announcing the appoint-
ment, Dr. Antonio Ciocco, act-
ing dean" of GSPH, said: “With
the appointment of Dr. Brous-
sard, we will be taking a ma-
jor‘ step in the development of
a" mental health program. Es-
t-ablishment of such a program
was one of the initial- goals of
our school at the time of its
founding in 1948.”

In addition to her appointment
as associate professor of public
health psych-iatry in the Depart.
ment of Public Health Practice,
Dr. Eroussard will hold a joint
appointment as assistant profes-
sor of child psychiatry in the
School of Medicine's Depart-

ment of Psychiatry.

 
  

two major areas: sensory pro-
cess and brain-behavior relation-
ships.

Dr. Werner will lead the group
working with sensory processes.

All aspects of .sensory p_roce_s§_;_

ing will be studied, from_ single
cell receptors to complex decod-
ing systems in the brain. Dr.
Fischer’s group will study the re-
lationships between brain struc-
tures and the resulting behavior

\

of organisms from mouse to,‘

man.

Two new faculty members
with joint appointments in psy-
chology and pharmacology are
expected to be named soon. A

E minimum of six fellows will be

supported by the NIH award
annually, and a considerably
larger number will participate
in the program. '

A number of interdisciplinary
seminars are being organized to
bring participating departments
into closer working relation-
ships.

cellor. Dr. Posvar sa-id that the
top ﬂoor of the new acquisition
will be converted into office and
laboratory facilities for the De-
partment of Anthropology. Plans
for the lower ﬂoor have not yet
been completed.
The building- is about 30 years
old. It was purchased from a
number .-of individual owners,
some of whom once constituted

“The new building will help
to ease the University's increas-
ing space problems,” Dr. Pos-
var, said. “It also will give the
growing Department of Anthro-

' pology additional room in which
to realize its full potential.”

  A Victory

age 4 — TI-I’E''-PI

 

... In Part    

._‘\

The decision issued by Chancellor Wesley  Posvar to initiate this
January a 10 per cent reduction on required hard—cover textbooks is a step
in the right direction. It reinforces what The Pitt News has long advocated:
our Book Center has a deﬁnite obligation to serve our student body, espe-
cially if it retains its communlity orientation in terms of its merchandise

J ’ ‘lines.

. However, we are not entirely satisfied with the decision reached by
the Chancellor, for we had ‘hoped that the 10 per cent discount would in-
clude all textbooks, and, more importantly, would be initiated before the
Fall Term. Unfortunately, students will not benefit from this move until
January. We are not in accord with this delay and must state that we be-
lieve it could have been feasible to enact this discount in time for students
to benefit during the entire school year. i

A compromise was reached, though, and it does serve to illustrate

 what can be done when students, faculty members, and administrators
 ._work' togetherto rectify an unfair policy. The Committee to Review the

Book Center Policy had four long, gruelling sessions, weighing the pros and

 cons of issues such as whether the Book Center should only serve students

or should also serve theicommunity, and whether we should eliminate dis-
counts entirely or include students as well as faculty and staff.
The student members of the Committee held firm that students must

definitely benefit from the Book Center, if it continues as a commercial
venture that caters‘ to the community as well. We had hoped for an across-
the-board discount, but settled for a 10 per cent discount on all required
textbooks as a start in the night direction.

We had no idea that this -discount could not be enacted until January
until a few days ago. We feel that as members -of the Policy Committee we
should have been informed, as we were not, that this is an impossibility.
Because we were led to believe that whatever decision was reached could be
enacted before September, we are disappointed that this has not turned out

to be the case. We also wish that the Committee’s full recommendation of 4?!

a 10 per cent discount on all required textbooks would have been enacted.

We are not dis-heartened, however, for the action taken by the Chari-
cellor indicates that our cause was not ignored and was given consideration.
Also, a compromise was reached that does not entirely satisfy us, but it
does show that our requests were evaluated and partially approved.

Our “victory” may appear minor to some, but we regard it as a be-
ginning. Students did partidipate on the policy-making committee and their
complaints were heard. Furthermore, action was taken as a result of the
Committee’s recommendations, a perfect illustration that when students
engage in a concentrated effort, there is ‘hope for some success.

ALTHOUGH BOTH Chan-
cellor Wesley W. Posvar and
Dean of Student Affairs Jack
 Critchﬁeld took office during
‘ _ the Spring Trimester, only a
’-*fraction of our student pop-
ulation was attending school
at the time. The majority of
our student body was not on
. campus when these" men as-
‘sumed their positions and is

being introduced to them in
their new roles for the ﬁrst
_,t_ime. ‘

. The Spring Term witness-
, ed Chancellor David H.
"Kurtzman assumed the title
of Chancellor Emeritus and
. then leave the University to
; , "take a position in Governor
Raymond P. Shafer’s cabinet
as Superintendent of Public
Instruction for the State of
Pennsylvania. Chancellor
Posvar. officially took over
, June 1, with Dr. Kurtzman
 " serving as senior adviser un-
,.til Sept. 1. Dean Critchﬁeld
. ‘assumed his position at the
end of July.

. Both men have thus far in-
dicated a real willingness to
not only discuss issues of vi-
tal concern to students, but

   
  

to search for solutions to key
problems. Although he was
not yet Chancellor when the
Book Center Policy Commit-
tee was appointed, for ex-
ample, Dr. Posvar made a
concerted effort to meet the
students’ requests halfway.
And‘ Dean Critchﬁeld, who
was a member of the Book
Center Policy Committee, in.-
dicated by his contribution
that if he thinks the stu-
dents are right, -they will
have his wholehearted sup-
port. .

IT IS an encouraging sign
for the coming year to re-
ceive more than just lip serv-
ice; The actions of both
Chancellor Posvar and Dean
Critchﬁeld have thus far
been in the ﬁne tradition of
our Chancellor Emeritus
Kurtzman, whose open door
policy of meeting and‘ dis-
cussing the issues with stu-

dents stands out as a ﬁne ex-

ample to emulate.

The issues of student con-
cern demand that students
and administrators work to-
gether if they are to be
solved to the satisfaction of

I ' Subscription ﬁve dollars the year.

all parties. One key question
to tackle involves the out-of-
state student ratio and the
importance of achieving a
cosmopolitan student body.
The new dormitories will n-ot
be completed for several
years, so there must be a
real effort to develop an ef-
fective off —campus housing
program, for example, to al-
low larger numbers of resi-
dent students until the dorms
are built. Students are con-
cerned about the question of
“regionalism” and, whether
this fate will befall our stu-

_ dent body.

Time must be spent to re-
spond to questions concern-
ing students and to discover
solutions to problems that
affect them. The Book Cen-
ter Policy Committee allow-
ed stu-dents to be part of a
policy-making body on a
question that directly involv-
ed them, and we hope this is

-only the beginning of stu-

dent participation in this
manner.

The issues facing our new
administration are challeng-
ing, but we are encouraged
by the fact that both Chan-
cellor Posvar and Dean
Critchﬁeld have indicated
that they are willing to sit
down and discuss problems

- of student concern and to try

to ﬁnd a means of solving
these problems. If the past

-few months are any indica-

tion, students should hope-
fully be making real strides
towards attaining their goals.

_COLUMN POLICY
The articles appearing on

  A New Administration  A iR€aliiStiC APPT0aCh

THE ACADEMIC integrity guidelines established_ by

the School of Liberal Arts represents a realistic approach\to ‘

a perennial problem. Instead of establishi-ng an honor code,
which students themselves have protested will not Work at
this University, the School of Liberal Arts, under the leader-
ship of Dean James Kehl, have made available facilities and

proctors upon the teacher’s request to solve the problem ‘

of classroom cheating. . -

We commend the action taken by the School of Lib-
eral Arts, for it reveals the careful thought that went into »
the preparation of these guidelines’. The guidelines classify
cheating in two categories, for example, opportunistic and
premeditated, to deal-with each case as fairly as possible.

AN IMPORTANT feature of the guidelines is that they
are optional, for, ‘as the statement reads: “Standards that
apply in a given classroom are set primarily by the. instruc-
tor. To the extent that he is concerned, objective, and con-

sistent, he has reason to expect similar behavior of

students.” .

This is no decree established by the School of"Liberal
Arts demanding that instructors adhere to the code. But
the School of Liberal Arts is providing a realistic means of

curtailing the cheating problem, which any instructor may‘

use. The statement points out that “All faculty members
are urged to consider this statement carefully and adhere-
to it in conducting their School of Liberal Arts classes.”
The proctors and larger classroom facilities arethere for
the asking, but. the instructor always has the option to
makethe ﬁnal decision as to whether or not he wants ssto
avail himself of these aids. »

Dean Kehl sought and received approval of these guide
lines from the Executive Council of the School of Liberal

Arts and the students’ Liberal Arts Cabinet. Chancellorg

Wesley W. Posvar has also endorsed the guidelines. We,.too,
support them, as a workable approach to an ever-present

. problem. .

Extortion, Part One

OFF-CAMPUS housing is
admittedly an issue which
does not directly affect the
majority of University stu-
dents. But those who elect
to shrug off and ignore that
problem are themselves vic-
tims of another form of ex-
tortion. The Pitt Bookstore,
the only source for textbooks
used in University courses,

‘is exploiting students to a

degree equal to exploitation
by the landlords.
The prices at the book-

' store are being artiﬁcially in-

ﬂated to enable management
to recoup some of the losses
caused by theft and ineffici-
ency. Price stickers prepared
by the bookstore are often

» placed over the manufactur-

ers list prices printed on the
book covers. Peeling these
stickers off reveals prices
run as much as one third

‘higher than that suggested.

The student cannot buy his
books elsewhere; he must

submit to the price dictates

of a store which is not run

V for his beneﬁt.

Also, the bookstore has re-
peatedly refused to grant a

* discount on purchases made
“by students. Yet faculty and

staff at the University auto-
matically receive a 10 per
cent markdown on their pur-
chases. And only two blocks
away, at the Carnegie-Mellon
Universtiy Bookstore, stu-
dents receive a discount. It
is thus questionable if the
University is operating the

-' store for the beneﬁt of the
. students or whether the stu-

dents are paying for the ben-
eﬁt of the bookstore and thus
for the University.

THE BOOKSTORE is re-
puted to be the most com-
plete store of its type in
Western Pennsylvania, and
as such is well patronized by
the general community.
These patrons should pay list

price for books, but Univer-

sity students should not be
forced to do so or to’ pay a
premium when they have no

other place to buy.

The Bookstore‘s policy on
used books is equally ex-
ploitive. Not only do they

 

 
 

  

 
    
  
  
 
  
  
  
 

Since it's the other guy
you have to watch out for,

make sure you can.

refuse to purchase used pa-
perbacks, but they also give
no more than half of the new
value on those used books
which are accepted. These
books are then sold for two
thirds of the price of new
copies, that is, they are not
buried under a stack of total-
ly unrelated volumes in an
unvisited corner of the store.

The Student Government
Book Exchange has attempt-
ed to remedy the problem of
used books, but it has not
been totally successful. The

Bookstore still remains the .

largest dealer in used books
and attempts to take proﬁts
at the expense of the stu-
dents. ’ A
THE ISSUE of the con-
ﬂict of interest of John Lang-
staff, the director of the Uni-
versity’s Auxiliary Enter-
prises, the managing agency
for the Bookstore, between
his University position and
his ownership of Your Cam-
pus Store has been thrashed
about for close to six months
without any changes having
been made. Many items sold
in the Bookstore are avail-
able for a smaller price at
Your Campus St-ore. And
many items not found in the
Bookstore are carried by
Langstaff’s private opera-
tion. Again, the students of
the University are the ones
who suffer from this situa-
tion. Their Bookstore does
not serve their needs; they
are forced to pay what ap-
pear to be ﬁxed prices or buy
at the store of the man who
is in charge of the Pitt Book-
store. The condition is in-
tolerable.

As other schools, such as.

Harvard, Columbia, theUni—
versity of California at Berk-
ely, and the University of
Michigan, bookstores are
owned and operated by the
students for the students.
This has been discussed at
Pitt and then quietly drop-
ped. Yet the administration
has not served the students
needs in their operation of
the Pitt Bookstore. We have
met only with silence, not
with action.

New Draft Law?

The Shame of it All   .

CONGRESS HAS again
revealed its “reactionary na-
ture by passing the Military
Selective Service Law of
1967. This law was enacted
after much debate.

Under the new law, the
first to be drafted will be
those non-deferred men be-
tween the ages of 19 and 26.
Undergraduate student de-
fcrments will be now award-

ed to any student in good __

standing. The draft test and
comparison of college class
rankings will no longer be a
factor in the determination
of educational deferments.
The new law, however, will
make life very difficult for
the aspiring graduate stu-
dent. “Starting next sum-
mer, graduate students in
medical, dental, health, and
essential technical will be the
only graduate students giv-

en new deferments,” report- '

ed Congressman Moorhead.

THE NEW extension of
the draft, moreover, will
maintain the power of the 10-
cal draft boards. “The local
boards are still in full con-
trol of most, draft proce-
dures. They determine wheth-
er Peace Corpsman, VISTA
volunteers, part time stu-
dents and apprentices incri-
tical occupations are to be
deferred,” stated Moorhead.

Unfortunately, the new
draft extension does not
solve any of the complex
problems that hover over the
present Selective Service Sys-
tem. Many a college senior
will have to ponder ‘an un-
certain future because of the
draft. Future law students
will have to “take the chance”
of being hauled out of law
school because of the loss of
their graduate deferment.
Graduate schools should ex-
pect a sharp decline in en-
rollment over the next few
years.

These very facts reveal
that the draft, as it present-
ly exists, is in fact a danger
to the future of our society.
It will drain both the law
schools and the graduate
schools of future students.
Thus, it (the draft) will in
turn drain the nation of a

good number of future schol-
ars and leaders.

THE SELECTIVE Serv-
ice, on the other hand, ar-
gues that a young man re-
turning from a stint in the
armed forces will tackle his
educational studies more vig-
o1 ously. The man discharged
from the army, says the
draft supporter, can be cor-
related with the more suc-
cessful student.

Yet, this specious argu-
ment neglects a very vital
fact. It fails to acknowledge
the plight of the 22 year old
college graduate, who will
both lose his deferment and
be thrown back into the
“prime inductee group re-
gardless of age . . .” This
means, then, that the future
law student for example will
have to wait until he is 24
before he will be able to start

by Paul Stoller

his legal studies. Yet, at 24
how many men would have
the fortitude or desire to
forego working or “settling
down” in lieu of a legal ca-
reer. The number would be
negligible!

The educational and per-
sonal shortcomings of the
present draft system, how-
ever, only graze the surface
of the complex problems ger-
main to the draft and arm-
ed forces. Under the present

*1

system there is prodigious .

waste of money and man-
power.

WITH THE present three
million man force, the army
is forced to train a million
new men each year. Unfor-
tunately, military training
for most of these new draf-
tees will be in vain because
most of them will only serve
the required two year stint.

forward with a clear and con-
cise statement on Academic In-
tegrity, but in the process it
has demonstrated a real desire
to mprove the quality of the
school and to concretely work
with the student body toward
this end. During the past sum-
mer the Liberal Arts Cabinet
discussed the “Academic Integ-
rity Statement.” Afterwards sug-
gestions weer offered to Dr.
Kehl. In practically all cases the
opinions of the student cabi-
net were incorporated in the
ﬁnal proposal.

This statement represents an
effort to raise the academic qual-

 

 

ity of the University of Pitts-
liurgh. It is a vital step toward
making Pitt one of this nation’s
major universities. I do not
mean this in the sense of mak-
ing Pitt the “Harvard of the
West,” nor do I mean it in any
terms of “rah-rah” school spir-
it. I am speaking of the crea-
tion of an institution of the
highest academic quality and in-
tegrity. From this, everyone
shall gain; to this, everyone
must give. “The Academic In-.
tegrity Statement” lends us a

hand toward reaching that goal.

That there is a signiﬁcant

 

   

amount of cheating at Pitt is a
fact known to the large major-
ity of the student body. It is an-
other truism that the academic
quality of a school varies direct-
ly with the academic integrity of
its students. If a working hon-
crs code is our eventual goal
(as indeed it should be), it.is
our ﬁrst task to stop the cheat-
ing. Only in an atmosphere were
cheating is the rare and heavily
disciplined exception to the rule

'a chance. I believe that the new

provisions, if properly enforced,
will help us in this effort. Every

America:

Monday, September 11, 1967

The Sickness Within

CERTAINLY THE saddest
thing about America today
is its lack of a sense of prior-
ity. American spends on the
average of 30 billion dollars
annually to maintain a “com-
mitment” in Vietnam, while,
despite what the present Ad-
ministration claims, it ne-
glects its first real obligation
—— to conscientiously main-
tain the welfare of the Amer-
can people. It is thus no ac-
cident that Negroes riot and
kill for a dignity they have
never been allowed, that chil-
dren die of famine in Appa-
lachia, and that millions suf-
fer the stench, squalor, and
f ulminating hatred that have
come to mean the American
city.

It is more than ironic-it
is indeed tragic——that Amer-
ica, the. most fortunate of
nations, and for so long so
magnanimous to other states,
has recently ignored so mis-
erably and ignominiously her
own domestic needs. Current
events make this deﬁciency
only too apparent. “Country
X” has received millions of
dollars worth of American
arms and armory from Con-
gress, while in South Caro-
lina, a child's stomach is
swollen with hunger. Sena-
tors are found guilty of ﬁ-
nancial malfeasance while
rats run rampant through in-
adequate city schools. Every-
where the air is rife with a
marked loss of conﬁdence in
Congress and an even more

palpable disrespect for law
and authority that is so pow-
erful as to make one ponder
just how mighty America
really is. To intensify this
dilemma still further,Amer-
ica now enjoys, at least in
theory, the greatest prosper-
ity in its history.

Perhaps this loss of per-
spective is accountable to
our “arrogance of power,”
perhaps simply to happen-
stance. Whatever the gene-
sis, it is fortunately not a
chronic ailment. Contrary to
Washington’s optimistic in-
sistence, the War on Pover-
ty and the one in Vietnam
cannot both be fought effec-
tively at the same time. One
severly delibiltates the other.
Perhaps the horrors of New-
ark, Chicago, and Detroit
will provide the impetus for
new policies of greater so-
briety. America surely needs
to take ﬁrst things ﬁrst. But
no more token Congression-
al shifting of funds will suf-
fice to cure America’s ail-
ment. New, imaginative, and,
above all, massive programs
must receive the billions of
dollars which have hereto-
fore been mischanneled. In
short, America desperately
needs a reawakening of the
pragmatism and common
sense which, until recently,
guided America to the prom-
inence she now enjoys, but is
in grave danger of losing.
Aside from all this, it will
require many years of stanch

by Lewis Taffer

patience, because a social
structure apparently exists
in America today which is
increasingly unpopular and
even more unsuccessful.

BUT RECENT develop-
ments are most discourag-
ing. Not too long ago, Con-
gress defeated a 40 million
dollar bill to curb rat prolif-
eration——an increasingly ser-
ious problem plagueing ma-
jor American cities, yet
minimally publicized. The
House’s reason for the bill’s
demise was its pharmaceuti-
cal value in offsetting Viet-
nam costs. Clearly, here,
priorities are injuriously dis-
torted. Worse yet, as the ef-
fects of our domestic ne-
glect so shamefully mount,
the detachment from reality
of Congress becomes more
glaring.

When America turns her
eyes inward to her own peo-
ple, then and only then will
she be fulﬁlling her first real
comm'itment——not the crea-
tion of a Great Society in
Southeast Asia, but the hon-
est and wholehearted pursuit
of a promise once made for
an American Great Society.
This would not be reneging
on some of our more dubi-
ous commitments abroad,
but the conscientious fulfill-
ment of a duty at home. Bil-
lions of dollars must be spent
and years of agonizing wait-
ing must be weathered be-
fore America’s infection is
arrested. This is What is

Freshman S7. Commuter

TROUBLE. A young f11"Si
year student of the Univer-
sity is being harassed by a
gang of arrogant seniors.
Fresh Man, disguised as Sal
Sewickley and who ﬁghts ‘cl
never endng battle in de-
fense of all ﬁrst year stu-
dents was sitting in his lair,
high atop Tower B, l31‘c‘~Yi11g
a brisk game of Canﬁeld
when the Frosh Alarm rang.
Immediately donning his
Fresh Man uniform, which
consisted of black shoes,
white socks, bermudas, White
Pitt sweatshirt, madras sport
jacket, and hair neatly done
in a pompadour, he said, In
what untold peril 1S some
freshman now?”

Carefully unscrewing the
window in order to effect a
spectacular leap, Fresh Man
was halted by the Frosh Con-
science, which said, “N0, 531,
you mustn’t do that.” Fresh
Man meekly replied, “L I
don’t know what came over
me. I, I’ll take the elevator.”

The Frosh Alarm pinpoint» «

ed the disturbance near the
Cathedral elevators. A group
of seniors were selling eleva-
tor permits to a hapless
freshman. Fresh Man imme-
diately sensed the need for
help, so he decided to enlist
the aid of his blood brother,

out was located in a far

and to begin the fusing of

is slowly yet unmistakably
splintering.

by Alan Disler

FRESH MAN spotted his
chum easily for his distinc-
tive Commuter uniform,
which was a dashing ensem-
ble consisting of black PF
Flyers for catching missed
trolleys, and a commuter util-
ity belt, on which hung a
money changer, token sack,
and PAT time schedule card.

“What ho, Commuter,”
said Fresh Man.

“How do, Fresh Man,” re- _,

plied The Commuter.

“COMMUTER,” implored
Fresh Man, “I need your
help. One of my troops is in
trouble. Some seniors. You
know.”

“Fresh Man, you know
that’s your responsibility,”
said Commuter, aghast.
“Why don’t you ask Dorm
Rat?”

“Commuter, you know
Dorm Rat cannot see the
light of day. And anyway,
these are out-of—state sen-
iors and this freshman is
from Latrobe.”

“WHAT,” SHRIEKED
Commuter. “Outrageous. Let
me give the Commuter’s
rallying cry, which any,
commuter within three miles
will respond to.” He put both
hands to his mouth, cupping
it, and cried, “The 54C Big
Red to Natrona Heights is
three minutes early.”

Immediately the Tuck
Shop was emptied and there
was only sneaker scuff marks
on the‘ floor to show that
anyone had ever been there.

WASHINGTON — Are the

According to a recently convict-

maintained that the drugs that

Addressing a Crowd Of
over two thousand incoming
freshmen, representatives of
the administration, facult.V
and students welcomed the
class of 1971, Tuesday In the
Carnegie Music Hall. After
the opening prayer by R€V‘
erend Samuel Gibson, presi-
dent of the University Chap-
lain Assn., Jack B. Critch-
field, welcomed the group as
the “ﬁrst freshman class’ he will
work with as Dean of S-tudent
Affairs.

Director of Admissions Bern-
ard J. Kobosky described the
process by which the applicants
were selected. He realized that
students “aren’t pieces of pa-
per,” but he also noted that t-his
year's selection was no easy job.
“We are people dealing with

people, and We are not infalli- _,

ble.” He stated that the ‘‘real
business of Admission is to de-
liv-er to the Dean an entering
class of proper number and of
proper ability.”

Kobosky maintained that the
University is an “intellectual in-
stitu.tion,” and that it should
have a student body of quality.
“There is no sense in accepting
a person if he oan’t keep up in-
tellectually.” He deﬁned the term
qu-ality in terms of -the “whole
person,” but rejected the idea
of a whole class of ideal people.
“We have no ideal candidate by
which we measure every appli-
cant.

“We are dealing with ﬂesh
and blood human beings. Admis-
sions is an individual matter. We

accept the individual who has
the best qualiﬁcations and a
strong character.” He related
that applicants are based on
three qualiﬁcations: the high
school record, the college en-
trance exams, and high school
recommendations. 01' this year’s
class, “70 per cent rank in the
top ﬁfth of their class, 24 per
cent in the top two ﬁfths, ﬁve
per cent in the middle ﬁfth, and
one per cent in the bottom two
fifths.”

Professor Alan J. Pfeffer,

chairman of the Department 0;.

the Germanic Languages, repre-
sented the faculty. He noted that
the “faculty is aware of the
quickening changes about them”
and -are “concious of their obli-
gations” to help students.

Professor Pfeffer told the as-
sembly that -the faculty is ready
to_ aid the. students in their
“search to do battle anew with
the thoughts and social condi-
tions that have plagued man.”
Students will do this through
the “arts, sciences, and other
disciplines.” He concluded that
the faculty must help the stu-
dent ﬁnd his “individual voca-
tional service to mankind.”

Dr. Wesley Posvar, chancellor
of the University, commented
that both he and the freshmen
“commence our careers at the
University at the same time. We
are all lucky to be here. This is
one of the major universities in
the United States.”

Dr. Posvar elaborated on the
“massive research program of
25 million dollars” that the Uni-
versity houses. He stated that
in- addition to the projects with-
in the University itself, the Uni-

vers-ity has “academic projects
located all over the world.’’ He
noted that these projects are the
“essence of a University, for
great research provides the cli-
mate for great teaching. The ex-
citement of the world ﬁlters to
every course of instruction.”

Chancellor Posvar emphasized
that What the student gains from
the University is “related to the
commitment you make to the
University.” He stated th-at the
student has a personal commit-
ment to “the learning process.”
In commenting on the cheating
issue, Dr. Posvar statedthat the
student has “to decide whether
an easy answer is more impor-
tant than personal integrity.”
Although he affirmed that "the
University has no honor -code,
-he held that ‘the decision is up
to the individual. .

He added that students hav
a group as well as personal com-
mitment to the University. He
told the freshmen that they
have a “permanent identity”
with the Class of 1971 that
“forms a bond, sentimental and
otherwise.” IIe,asked that as a
group commitment the fresh-
men should show their support
of varsity athletic teams. “An
enthusiastic student body is the
margin of success.” Dr. Posvar
hoped that the Class of 1971
“starts a new trend of support
of athletic teams.”

Dr. , Posvar stated that stu-
dents have a commitment to so-
ciety also. “One day your gen-
eration will solve today’s social

‘ problems. 'Ilhere is still much

you can do now. Pittsburgh is

_a leader in urban aztfa-irs and we

expect the Class of 1971 to be

center should not confine‘ itself to one mode of  i

walls the variety of human thought and expression.
It should focus upon all of the numerous ways of 7 
recording and communicating man's knowledge,
experience, and insights. And a university boo-k center j 7“
of this character should serve not only students and
faculty but also the many other groups which the _  g

of sufficient size to permit small gatherings
for authors’ receptions and similar occasions.
Here may be found not only fine or rare 0 ‘~

The Food:  

' Not to be outdone by other American
metropoli, Pittsburgh’s- Oakland area
boasts its list of culinary establishments.
Whether one’s _pleasure be frankfurters,
french fries, hamburgers, or hash, Oak-

A land has a wide variety of restaurants

that promise to delight one’s s-ulphur-
laden palate.
Best known among late night snack-
eis is the Oakland Original, at 3901
Forbes’ Ave., known affectionately to
Pitt's intellegentsia as the “O.” Whether
one wishes -a midnight “dog,” or just
some downright serious debates on meta-
pliysics, the employees at the Original
are famous for their cheerful eagerness
to serve. Last year, the renowned Crystal
Room was renovated and is now called
the Meat Room. Cocktails are served at
7 p.m. '
On "the next block of Fifth Avenue,
hose who believe this nation needs a

‘ good cheap hamburger dine in the cozy

‘ yet spacious atmosphere of Winky’s. A

relativeiy new addition to Beanery Row,
Winky’.s has already established itself as
the home of the ubiquitous Big Wink
and son of Oakland’s more rambunctious
insomniacs.
/8 Oakland has long known the effer-
vescent yet warming charm of her fav-

orite son, “Smiling Jack” Canter. Locat- _

ed at 209 Atwood St., Canter’s delica-
tessen has long been a mecca for those
University students with the more dis-

"criminating palate. Aside from Jack’s

.......»mc-n-y-.,r,.<_.  ..,. -,.,.~

magnetism, the waitresses literally
swamp the diner with the Old World
charm that Canter’s is known for.

For a truly sumptuous repast, Scot-

ty’s, directly opposite the ‘dorms on’

Forbes Ave., is the in-spot. Long noted
for-Tits cleanliness, the meticulous and
fashionable decor is topped only by the
mystical H charm of the ‘waitresses.

soakiand Review . For Fresh

An imposing Oakland landmark out-
done only by the Cathedral, the White
Tower has always been a favorite night-
spot. Pittsburghers flock from miles

‘around to savor the bastion’s famous‘

java not to mention its regionally fam-
ous toasted matzoh.

Near the Original, but not too near,-

is the "bustling little archive named
Frankie Gustine’s. Specializing in ham-
burgers and other imported specialties,
Gustine’s is a literal storehouse of mem-
orabilia of Pittsburgh sports. -Frankie
reports that he has decided not to add a.
new wing to the Pitt Sports Room, as
existing space should’ suffice for many
years to come.

Best known to commuters» and other
University fringe groups is the Tuck
Shop on the Cathedral’s ground floor.
Special rates are available upon presen-
tation of PAT transfer slips, and bus
tokens are legal tender._ The new, air
conditioned “Big Red Room” combines
exotic food with an atmosphere filled
with vestiges of a great bygone era.‘ To
many of "Pitt's more transient types, the
Tuck Shop is- a second home.

The Hunt Room, in the cellar of the
Student Union, is a convergence point
fc-r most of the University’s intellectual
crowd. Needless to say, it's a rather
small place. Modern art buffs will relish
the abstract ketchup creations on the
walls and the incomparable angular
asymmetry of trash-strewn -table tops.
The gre.aseburger is recommended.

La-st,‘but byno means least frequent-
ed is Ambrosio Anunziata’s internation-
ally acclaimed Village Pizza concession.
The menu spans an impressive array of
Sicilian and Neopolitan delicacies rang-
.ing'from meatball. heroes to bisque tor-

toni.

 

The Symphony:

The Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra

The Rest:

If the new student on campus wishes :
to spend his idle time wisely all "he,
should do is travel. down Forbes Ave"
in the direction of the rustic Strari
theatre. There, students can enjoy th‘
latest third rate movies on the postage}
stamp sized movie screen. The
Strand movie goer will be slightly;-a 
palled by the funny rolling noises that *
come from the direction of the roof
The noises result from, the moderni-
Strand bowling alley which is located?
above the theatre. Bo-th places are rec-3
ommended to freshman by the Pitt News."

the jewels not unexpectedly, add

‘lionaire do to fend off obscurity,

Michael, David’s brother,

neuvers at Sandhurst would be
.a nice start. Some of the guys

- Michael soon found himself back
; luxuriating in the tender wash
_ of his parent’s total,d-isgu.st.The
“only _light in the entire situa-
. tion is that he is pretty used to

The beauty of this picture is
that it is able to combine all of
these things into one coherent
whole. There is a decent plot,
couple of good gimmicks, and
the kind of charactorization that
can take a good movie and make
it move, taking up any slack in
the action might leave by inter-
esting you in the characters
themselves.

David Tremayne is p1ayed\by
Oliver Reed who plays David as
a large barrel-chested man of 30
whose barrel is slowly dissolv-
ing into a bottrtle of buttermilk’.
He has bravdo, conﬁdence, a
loud voice. But somewhere not
too far in the ‘background there
is the knowledgevthat he is 30.
It covers him like the grey stub-
ble that he can never quite rid
from his chin. And any man
that can -be so large and im-
pressive, and still see himself as
‘something. more than the image
he suggests as he passes you on
the street cannot be all bad, and
the sympathy of the audience is
with him throughout the pic-
ture. Oliver Reed is a very good
actor. .

Michael has the personality of
a puppy. He even manages to
look like one. Perhaps he wags
his nose. Michael, in other words,
is a 22-year-old edition of Da-
vid. Although the two are phy-

sically dissimilar, there is the
same humanity and sense of
adventure in Michael that is
found in David. The whole_ prob-
lem is that he is younger, and
has to labor in his brother's
shadow. It hurts. Michael Craw-
ford plays the part well.

It is enough to say that the
jewels got stolen. The beauty of
the ﬁlm is in the methods, the
characters, the actors. It will be
in ‘Shadyside until Wednesday,
and it is worth the trip.

Wanted the students to know
that the punishment for cheat-

signment or the course. When
the University reaches the stage
when cheating is a rare and
heavily disciplined exception to
the rule, we migh-t be able to
t-hink about an rhonors code.” He
stated, however, that the Guide-
lines were “not a program to
punish, but im-prove. I hope the
teachers enforce them.”

Dean Kehl pointed out that

The annual Activities Fair will
-be held on Tuesday, Sept. 19,
from 9:30 a.m. .to 4 ‘pm. and
from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. Co-chain
men this year‘ are Bruce Barr

K‘-isilinsky from Associated Worn-

 en Students. In adidtion to -the

traditional representation of the
many membership groups on
Campus, this year, honoraries
and other groups with similar
member requirements have ‘been
invited to participate.

The Activities Fair is primar-
ily designed to introduce the

the student in either the course
or the assignment, depending on
whether, in the instructor’s opin-
ion, the» cheating was “premedi-
tated” or “opportunistic.” He -be-
lieves, however, “the student
should‘ expect to know the re-
quirements of -the course at the

outset of the term.” He empha-

sized th-at the SG Liberal Arts
Ca.-binet conﬁrmed that the ma-.
jority of students do not want
the honor system.

Dtan Keh-l related that the in-
structor must report the cheat-
ing incident and put it on re-
cord before the student's grade
may be affected. With a second
report, according to the guide-
lines, the student is dismisstd.

 

 _     ”            Hoelscher Announces
“The Jokers” Make It Look Easy Engineering Changes

mentals.

A series of seminars, a new
counseling program and faculty-
guided periodic reviews will aid
the student during his ﬁrst two
years of study. The new curri-
culum evolved party in response
to the complexity of modern
problems which have become a
primary concern to engineers.

Dean H o e l s c h e r explained,

The engineering curricu-lum
had been changing rapidly -across
the country. The engineering
program is almost always under
revision. ,

Dean Hoelscher believes that
the bachelor’s degree is “very
important for men and women”
as a base for three types of ac-
tivities: those who enter ‘indus-
try for a career; those who plan
graduate study in engineering;
and those who plan” graduate
study in another ﬁeld.

“We believe that students
emerging from this new pro-
gram will be better educated for
one of the three career goals -I
outlined. They wﬂl, -if we suc-

‘ ceed, understand and appreciate

the important problems which

confront our society. Many stu-

dents will continue to specialize
in one of the traditional ﬁelds
while growing numbers will
choose problems which cut
across traditional school boun-
daires. Whatever their choice,
they will, we hope, be better ed-
uoat-ed engineers."

i by LINDA GOLDSTEIN

, » In the bygone -days of Boss
' ‘ Tweed, it was an unheard of

practice for professional po-

 liticians to be directly affili-
— ated with universities. Even

' today, it is still a rarity.

_,-However, the number of excep-
tions is growing, and three illus-
trations of this trend at our
University are Dr.-Edward F.
‘Cooke, Mrs. Ruth Lutz, and City

.Counoilman Peter F. Fiaherty.

. ‘ Dr. Cooke, a -professor in po-
9 litical science, is the Democratic
candidate for Allegheny County

, treasurer and also serves as ma-

Tyor. of Oakmont Borough and
chairman of Oakmont Demo-
cratic Committee. Commenting
on his position as mayor of Oak-

P , mont, Dr. Cooke related, “I’m ei-
ther the ﬁrst of the last to be
called when a problem arises;
last because they've called every-
one else and got no response, or
first because -they don't know

f anyone else.” "

Dr. Cooke teaches a course
each »term on political parties
where students are required -to

 spend several hours on political

 assignments during campaign
time. When asked whether he

“felt that students think of po-

*-litics in national and internation-

" al terms rather than the local

levels of government, Dr. Cooke

replied, “Some students give 10-

“cal government and local poli-

» tics a low priority, but even

those persons become interested

7 and gain a new prespeotive”.

. pate so actively in local politics?
' “This my my ﬁeld and it helps
me to be a better teacher.” His
. comments on his upcoming cam-
paign—“It’s going to be very
interesting ."’

The sole Republican among
these three political activists is
Mrs. Ruth Lutz, who currently
; serves as vice chairman of the
 Edgewood Borough Republican
Committee. Mrs. Lutz, a lecturer.
=1-in‘ political science and the de-

' .partment’s major advisor, was
a me-mber of Borough Council
- for eight years and still retains
her post as a member of her
-borough's Civil Service Commis-
sion. Mrs. Lutz participates in
politics because “you get out of
I the world of theory and some-
I times rather impractical ap-
proach.”
What was her reaction to her
, experience in practical politics?
: “Disillusioned, maybe, more by
‘ .. the vo-ters and what they expect
' from local government than
from the workings of local gov-
ernment itself. Their vote seems
to give many people the license
to complain, badger, and often
_. ,waste time in needless telephone
*_calls. -There ‘is nothing worse
“than having my husband answer
"the telephone at 2 a.m. in the

morning to hear a complaint.”
Another recipient of com-
plaints, although on a larger
scale, is City Councilman Peter
F. Flaherty, who is now work-
ing towards his Ph.D. in poli-
tical science at the University.
As a councilman, Fiaherty does
receive complaints, but he be-
lieves that “most people don't
I know we have a complaint cen-
ter for the City of Pittsburgh.”

Flaherty’s affiliation with the
University began when he pur-
sued a master's degree in urban
zzdmini-stration at the Graduate
School for Public and Interna-
tional Affairs (GSPIA), a. de-
gree he received this past June.
"The courses I took at GSPIA
were geared towards local gov-
ernment and they tended to in-
crease my sense of values. I

l’oIiticaI Scientists E

MRS. RUTH LUTZ

also liked being brought back
into the educational system—it
was refreshing to be brought
face to face with old concepts
versus the contemporary value
system.

H-is decision to attain his doc-
torate in politicalscience was
based on the premise that “po-
litical science has broader con-
cepts. It’s more of a social sci-
ence -today, and it covers per-
haps a far greater area than
just urban affairs or politics or
political theory. I would hope

someday to be able to come back‘

to the classroom as a teacher,
for I enjoy associating with
young people. It’s almost essen-
tial to have a doctorate to be-
come a teacher in a university.”

Disregarding actual titles, the
personal satisfaction of all three
political activists reveal the def-

declaration.

» In order to achieve greater academic integrity and promote more uniform
reatment of violations, the School of the Liberal Arts (SLA) feels impelled to
ssue suggested guidelines for use by faculty memberswguidelines with crucial
ramifications for the student body. These guidelines have" been reviewed and
fndorsed by both the Executive Council of the School and the SLA Student
Cabinet.”Al1 faculty members are urged to consider this statement carefully and
dere to it in conducting their SLA classes. Standards that apply in a given
iﬁlafssroom are set primarily by the instructor. To the extent that he is concerned,
jective, and consistent, he has reason to expect similar behavior of his students.
UGGESTIONS FOR CLASSROOM CONDUCT TO MINIMIZE DISHONESTY

A. :Gene_ral Faculty Responsibility:
 ‘ 1. Present a positive statement of what is expected of the student in terms of
» assignments, methods of study, course requirements, and where appropriate,
' — mention the penalties for dishonest conduct. (Instances of dishonest academic
behaviour may be classified according to whether they are premeditated or
‘opportunistic. Academic dishonesty is opportunistic when an individual is B.
tempted to dishonesty by conditions of the moment. In addition to plagiarism, '
Z, “pe_rmeditated academic dishonesty consists of coming to an examination or

. other—'class session prepared to cheat through the use of unauthorized or in-

‘appropriate materials.” Both types are reprehensible, but opportunistic dis- 1
honesty may be interpreted as less so by some. Although the instructor de-

, termines punishment, the minimum penalty for opportunistic cheating should E_
’ .be failure in the specific assignment, whereas premeditated academic dishon-
esty should result in failure in the course.)
2. ‘ State whether attendance will affect the student’s grade and adhere to that

  Responsibility During Examinations: , _
1. Instructors are not policemen, but they are evaluators, and they can
evaluate best only if they can assume that an individual’s work is his own
/and was done under prescribed conditions. For this reason, instructors have

SPECIAL PROBLEM OF ADEQUATE EXAMINATION SPACE

Conditions surrounding some examinations are not completely conducive to
honest behavior on the part of students. Overcrowded classrooms, lack of proctors,
make the instructolds task of maintaining idea] testing COndltlOl'lS 
Accepted testing procedures suggest that, for each 50 students enrolled, one faculty
member, graduate assistant, or other proctor be present in the classroom during
an examination. Thus it is expected that an instructor will_require all of his
graduate assistants to be present when an examination is given. To the extent

that funds are available through SLA, the instructor should request funds when

‘%University Students Invade Europe

by BETH LA’I.ER-ICK
If you have ever clreamerl
of starting a riot in Venice’s
Saint Marks Square or get-
ting a sunburn on a beach in
Rome, or falling down an
authentic Swiss mountain,
then you should have been on
the University’s Student Union
.trip to Europe. Nineteen intre-
pid travelers walked, drank, and
prayed their way across the Con-
tinent last April and May, in
addition to nearly starting a
riot, getting sunburned and slid-
-ing down cliffs.

After committing ourselves to
take the trip, we were all set to
go——except for getting the ne-
cessary passports, shots, and
clo-thes. But by the beginning of
April everything was under con-
trol except our excitement. With
luggage tags put safely away
we managed to survive our ﬁnal
exams and to get home for a
'5:?E’\feyv frantic days of semi-quie-t-

ude. V
Through all the confusion on
April 22, all 19 of us some-how
found the way to a~basement
conference room in the TWA
te-rminal at Kennedy Interna-
tional Airpo-rt. We were hot,
tired and anxious, but we had
to wait until midnight for our
plan. The only thing that salved
our anger was the two dollar
food voucher_that each of u-s
received. Food, heck. We found
better things to spend our mon-
ey on. And 18 is the magic age
in New York!
 By. midnight most of the Pitt
"-4 crew had downed their drama-
mine or similar potions, but I
had a headache, so I took two
aspirins in addition to the dra-
mamine. I think some kindly

soul pushed me gently ointoithe
plane.

To tell the truth, I don't re-
member too much about the
plane ride over, except that
someone woke me up for a late
dinner and a very early break-
fast. At 6 o’clock New York
time and noon London time we
found ourselves collecting our
belongings and heading toward
our first hotel stop, the Saint
James Court.

Now the Saint James was a
unique place in that you almost
needed a map to ﬁnd your room,
because it seemed as if corri-
dors magically_appeared out of
nowhere. When we had ﬁnally
wound our way down the cold
corridor to our room, my room-

_ mate, Tess, Weil, and I were

greeted with a surprise—some-

' one had forgotten to put a heat-

er in our room (in England al-
most all hotels and homes do
not have central heating). We
spent_a half hour trying to ﬁnd
a thermostat until we ﬁnally
ﬁgured out that everyone else
had a heater. Oh well, we ﬁnal-
ly got warm.

The Pitt crew met our tour
guide, a German named Alf

'_ time.

Knuhr, that evening, and we
also met the rest of the group
that would be touring with us.
They were from all over the US
and Canada, and from what we
could see they seemed quite nice.

WITNESS FOR THE DEFENSE _

Dave Hart has less than two weeks to mold the offense

he needs to achieve respectability this season. What he has
now is a sputtening unit that leaves the impression of being

_...- _ disorganized. The players seem unsure. They show no conﬁ-

dence in their ability to move the football.
. By contrast, the defense is an aggressive, inspired unit.
Still without Greg Keller, their ace in the middle,.they’ve
managed to impress the onlookers at Trees Field.

But without an offense that can maintain some degree

  \\\\\\\\\\

\\

of ball control, it really doesn’t matter how well the defense
plays. Anyone would have a tough time walking from the
stadium to the Cathedral in the amount of time the defen-
sive team had on the sidelines during each game last year.
BECAUSE of an offense that had trouble crossing its

. own 40, let alone the other team’s goal line, the defense spent

most of its time digging in with their backs to the goal posts. .

‘ The physical strain was tremendous.

Hart recently pointed out how much different it would
be “if the defense would have a chance to defend 80 yards

instead of 20.”

Last season the -defensive team had-only two bad games,

W

 In between, the defense played well enough so that with any '
kind of sustained offense, the Panthers might have won

several more games.

HART and his staff do not have much time to make
sure that history doesn’t repeat itself. But if last week’s
practice can be used as a guide, the Panthers will be carbon
copies of last year. The individual players are bigger, strong-
er, and faster, but the net result will ‘be a valiant defense

and an importent offense.

. The loss of tailback Denny.Ferris means more than the
absence of a runner who could break open a game. It means
that opposing defenses will close up the middle because thev
don’t have to worry about the sidelines. As a result the ef-
fectiveness of fullback Mike Raklewﬁcz is immediately re-

. duced.

important, he could pass-block.

BUT JONES lost his tem_per after running extra wind
sprints on the ﬁrst "day of practice and he said things he
shouldn’t have to one of the assistant coaches. He said those
things within earshot of other players and coaches, and al-
though he apoligized shortly after, the coaches cut him from

the squad to insure future discipline.

Sophomore tailbacks Paul Bergman and Gary Cramer
run with desire. But they don’t have the raw speed or the
experience to {ignite the offense.

One of the Panthers’ strong points is the receiving
corps. Deep receivers Bob Longo, Skip Orzulak, Joe Mc-
Cain, Chip Rife, and George Medich are first-rate pass catch-
ers when they’re healthy. However, they’re not going to be
-of any offensive value unless someone can get the ball to

them.

That puts the burden of the passing attack on the quar-
terbacks. But in the scrimmage Saturday against the fresh-
men, however, none of the three QB candidates had suffi-
cient time to throw. The center of the offensive line might
have had Saturday morning classes for all the blocking they

did.

1 WHEN BOB BAZYLAK, Frank Gustine, or Jeff Barr
had the time, they threw well. But it was a case of com-
pleting a couple of passes and then fumbling the snapback
or gettling thrown for a 10 yard loss on the next play. Never
did the offense appear. in charge of the game. And not once

“Eastern football is on the up-
swing. The most dramatic im-
provement should be at Pitts-
burgh . . . The bleak part of the
picture is that the schedule is the
toughest in the land.” —A'nson
Mount, Playboy magaz2'ue.....

Panther football 1967 be-

gins in two weeks. And back
for his second try at improv-
ing the Jungle Cats is head
coach Dave Hart.

After the 1-9 record last sea-
son, Harrt made changes in his

offensive formations. He opened
up the attack. He added the pro

set; he ‘varied -his original I-for- ‘

mation. A

His reasons were obvious. The
'66 team was shutout twice,
scored only one touchdown in
three other games and was out-
pointed 3-1 by the opposition. -

With a young team last year, .

Hart greeted 17 starters at the
summer camp. He also wel-
comed his first recruits since
he became head coach. Decem-
ber, 5. .,1965-.  sophs-
mores, one of the urges: groups
in recent years, are now ﬁght-
ing the returnees for regular
positions; from seven to nine
sophs may open against UCLA
Sept. 23. K '

But injuries, the biggest head-
ache of college football coaches,
struck early’ and forced Hart to
juggle his depth chart.

Two of the biggest losses have
been senior Greg Keller and
sophomore Warren Allen. Kel-
ler, a 6-3, 220 pound middle line-
backer who was tabbedgas a pos-
sible All-American candiate, is
cut with a bruised shoulder.

Allen, who stands at 6-1, 190,
has been one of the early sur-
prises holding down the first
team’s left guard spot. He was
spiked last week in practice.

O Since _I-Iart had planned to re-
vamp hvis sluggish offense, his
first problem was to ﬁnd a quar-
terback. Presently, senior Bob

'Bazylak, ‘last year's sole hold-

-so far.
Fullback Mike Raklewicz, who
averaged 2.9 yards a carry last
year, appears ready to improve

o-n his junior record. To go with ‘i

Raklewicz, Hart is optimistic
about a 5-11, 190, sophomore
named Joe McCain, who showed
plenty of speed and a good pair
’ of hands in spring practice.
Although McCain is the num-
her one wingback, Hart has been
using him at tailback where
Skip Orszulak and Gary Cramer
have been operating.

Experience Spells Difference

As Baz Leads QB Candidates

share his viewpoint.

“I think I’ve improved my
running by working on it hard
over the summer,” said Gustine,
“and Jeff’s arm has improved.
We all have the ability to play.

“I feel I can step in at any
time and do the job.”

Bazylak "felt the other three
signal callers were all good, in-
cluding sophomore Chuck Win-

' ters who was injured during the
spring. I

“All throw real well,” said
Bazylak. “I think any one of
them could do a good job’ me-
chanically if they came in, but
the coach would probably have
to call the plays.”

Barr came closest to sharing
his coach's analysis, but felt that
all three quarterbacks were near-
ly equal as far as passing the
football. “Frank can really drill
the ball, but I can throw as ac-
curately as -the others. I throw
as well within 20-30 yards but
not quite as hard. Baz is the
quickest at dropping back and
throwing.” - —

Experience, however seems to
be some sort of magic catylist.
For instance, Alabama’s Bear
Bryant played Steve Sloan at
defensive halfback for two years
so he could get some experience.
Sloan's senior year, he was an
All-American quarterback.

“Experience in a game —— it
doesn't matter whether it’s of-
fense or defense — relaxes you,”
offers Barr as an explanation.
“You handle yourself better and
.can react to different situations
more easily.” Bazylak agrees,

“Experience relaxes you in‘ a
way. I know that just playing
defense last year helped me.”
Bob felt, that covering team-

mates like Bob Longo and Chip
Rife in practice gave him a
better understanding of how he
had to play as quarterback.
However, even Bazylak’s ex-
perience is limited. Last year he
played briefly against Syracuse,
Miami, and Penn State and the
whole game against Notre Dame.
Vvhile the start against the Irish
was enough to age any quarter-
back two seasons, Baz still feels
it’s been “three years since I
really played quarterback.” Ap-
parently, what experience Bazy-
lak has is coming across in the
way he is practicing. V ‘
“Baz is doing better than us

‘and should be starting,” said

Barr. “Hehandles himself well
and there are a lot —of things
we're not doing right that Baz
does well.”

Gustine also feels that “game
experience ,is important and
that’s why Baz-will start. Sure
we’re sophomores and we’ll
make mistakes; but like the
coach says, we play too national
a schedule for normal or

sophomore —— ‘mistakes. I dqn’t

think it’s a question of not
enough ability. ’

“Bazylak will start against
UCLA, but Jeff and I will get
a chance to play and whoever
moves the team and for whom-
ever the breaks fall will play.”

UCLA visits the Stadium in
less than two weeks. Right now
i-t looks like»Bob Bazylak will
be calling the signals. He’s got
the experience’ and the savvy.
The Bruins are plenty to Worry
about themselves, but Baz’ll
probably feel a little pressure
from two eager sophomores on
the bench watching his every
move.

The ball was on the Blues’ 39 yard line, second down,
one yard to go. Bob Bazylak jammed the ball into tailback
Dennis Ferris’ gut and Ferris bounced off tackle for 31
yards. Six plays later, Baz called on Ferris again; near the
Whites’ goal where the going is roughest. Ferris scored
from the three and the Blues led the Whites, 6-0,_ in the an-

‘ nual spring intrasquad game, fivemonths ago.

Up until the later part of May, Ferris, hailed as one of
the finest halfbacks t-o attend Pitt in recent years, was ex-
pected to be the ﬁrst’ team tailback. But the 6-0, 190 pound-
er never had a chance to really show what he could do.

WHILE WORKING on a
construction gang this sum-
mer, Ferris lost the vision in
his right eye when a chip of
concrete rock lodged in the
eye.

Doctors feared his sight
would forever be impaired,
e-specially when the eye fail-
ed to respond to treatment
quickly. They scratched him
from the Panther lineup.
And it has been only within
the last month that Ferris
can see out of the eye.

OBJECTS still appear fuz-
zy to him and sometimes he
sees double. When he goes
outside, he must wear his
brown rimmed, dark glasses
because his right pupil is di-
alated. The doctors want no
strain on his eye.

AND IT’S A SAD, very
depressing scene watching
him stand along the side-
lines during football prac-

Pan“, 31.93 ,,.,-ghly touted tice. “I feel terribly sorry for

Taizback , _, him because he wanted to

play so badly,” said head coach Dave Hart. Ferris’ loss is a

blow to the offense, but Hart feels his players’ “eyesight

and health are of greater importance and no chance should
be taken when these may be at stake.”

Presently, Ferris’ collegiate football career lives on
paper. He realizes what everyone expects. “No one has ever
seen me play, -how do they know what I can do,” he says. “I
looked good a few times and everyone blows it up.”

“I can’t worry over this year. I just have to wait. I’ll
go along with whatever the doctors say. But I know I have
a helluva lot to live up to even before I put on a uniform
again,” said Ferris as he stabbed at the turf with his cleats.

HIS DEPTH PERCEPTION, n-ot completely restored
yet, creates problems for him at UiIneS- In ‘the Cafeteria
when he goes for milk, he sometimes spills the milk on the
table instead of in the glass. In hallways, he walks into peo-
ple who weren’t there. On
the ﬁeld, he can’t catch a
thrown football.

He tries to laugh it off.
But deep inside he can’t. He
feels like a cripple. He feels
he’ll be laughed at; the other
players-‘ will kid him but it
doesn't affect him until he's
alone in his room.

And all he wanted was to
play football for the Pan-
thers. “I wanted to play
against UCLA and Notre
Dame, I wanted to beat them
for Pitt. I didn’t care where
I played, halfback or de-
fense. I just wanted to play
for Pitt,” said Ferris.

Panther Cubs Generate Hope;
Raw Talent Impresses Coach

by MIKE BROURMAN
Only a few spectators were present during varsity foot-

ball practice. Then, when the upperclassmen trudged off the
ﬁeld, the ring of viewers began to enlarge. Soon the crowd

was bigger than"the turnout at many -home basketball games. They
were there to see the freshmen.

This is no ordinary freshman football team. It is the most
publicized group to ever hit the University. It has been called great,

even before any of its members
do-nned a pad, threw a block, or’
made a tackle.

If the publicity is overwhelm-
ing, then so is the reason for it.
In three years of football des-
pair, the freshmen are the one
breath of fresh evergreen. They
are being looked upon as the
Moses to lead Pitt football out
of the Wilderness of defeat.

Dave Harts says it willingly,
“Our hopes for the future rest.
with these freshnlen.” This cry
is echoed by others.

Although in his second year
of coaching, this team is the re-
sult of Hart's first all-out re-
cruiting year. “I was hired in
December which left me only
half a year to recruit last year,”
Hart explained.

“I came here cold. We had to
hurry, scrape and scratch for
players. For the time we had,
I'm well pleased. That group,
our current batch of sophomores,
is a pretty good crop.

“This time we had a. whole
year,” he noted. “It goes with-
out saying that I’m more than
pleased with the result. There's
an awful lot of raw talent there.
They have the size and they
have the general makeup.
They’re the type of boys we
need in order to win.”

Because ‘of ‘their big buildup,
.the freshmen are expected to
win from the start, including
this year when they face West

‘Virginia, Oh-io State, Penn State

and Notre Dame. This worries
Hart, and it also worries frosh
coach Darrell Lewis.

They are less worried about
the ability of the freshmen to
handle the schedule than that
the freshmen will not have
enough time together to prepare
for it. For once again, as was
the case last year, the freshmen
are forced to work with the un-
dermanned varsity squad.

“This is the unfortunate part,”
said Hart. “We have to use them
with the varsity and when we
do this, we’re only hurting our-
selves. We try to give them as
much individual work as possi-
ble, but in certain periods, we
just have to use them.

“Of course, we want the fresh-
men to have a good season, but
the varsity comes first. I'm

afraid that the fres-hmen are

just not going to get enough

work as a team to be ready.”
Darrell Lewis is worried too,

but he's not quite as pessimis-
tic as Hart. “Each day we work
with the varsity is a. day lost,”
Lewis says. “But, on the other
hand, they do learn when. they
work with the varsity. They
pick up things from the coaches
that help. .

‘‘It’s tough,” he continued.
"The varsity needs four Weeks
to prepare a system that they
already know. The freshmen get
three weeks to learn an entire-
ly new system. But, if I can
have them for ten days to them-
selves, then they'll be  right.”

“They’re a very good crew,”
Lewis continues. “The potential
is there. There's a lot of natural
ability and they do things by
instinct, things like pursuit on

you have to teach to a lot of

Hutchko Ahead

Centers Eye Blueshirtl

by ROY JACOBS

A brief study of Dave Harts’ football depth chart seems

to reveal that at most positions rookie sophomores are giv-
ing the veterans a ﬁght for the -blue—or ﬁrst team—jerseys.
-But at one spot on the offensive line there is an interesting
duel shaping up that could snowball into out-and-out war in these
last two weeks before UCLA. Strangely enough, it’s not a case of
a two-year veteran being hard pressed by an eager sophomore, but

that of two sophomore centers
rhard pressing each other.

Right now Mickey Hut-chko
from Monongahela is holding
down the first team spot at cen-
ter, but Liberty Borough's Dave
Magyar is very anxious to switch
-places.

Actually, both sophomores
started out playing behind sen-
ior Tom Mitrakos last spring,
but when both boys started play-
ing so well, the coaches decided
Mitrakos could better be used
at tackle.

“The coaches told us that who-
ever has a good day will wear
the blue jersey,” rememlbered
Dave. “Whoever does the best
gets a chance to show what he-
can do. I think that's the best
way.”

“I never even wanted to play
offense,” said Mickey, “but as
long as you can play, you'll play
anywhere. If you're wearing a
blue jersey, you’ll learn to like
it.”

To a sophomore, winning a
blue jersey is harder than win-
ning a green beret. And so it is

understandable that one might
be a little overzealous.

“I never expected to play blue
shirt this year," said Hutchko.
“When coach Hart told me, I
got goose bumps all over.

“It’s the idea of going out
there as a sophomore against.
265 pound guys with two years
of experience. It's scary, and I'll
probably be sick Friday nights
—I was in high school—-but Sat-
urday’s worth it.

‘We’re constantly up for prac-
tice,” Hutchko elaborated. “We
both want to play. We’re both
hitting as hard as we can.” Some
skeptics would say it looked like
neither was hitting too hard in
Saturday's scrimmage when the
freshmen ran over the offensive
line.

“It’s a matter of coordination
that’ll be ironed out over the
next two weeks,” explained Dave.
“I think we can open the holes
and the backs can run through
them.”

Most likely, the blocking on
the line will come around.

UCLA Sept. 23  

Analysis by Mike Brourman

UCLA coach Tommy Prothro keeps insisting that his
teacm is in a rebuilding year. Then in the next breath he

‘predicts another trip to the Rose Bowl for the Bruins, who were

ranked fifth nationally last year.

The top player and perhaps the top player in
the country is quarterback Gary Beban who com-
bines a deadly throwing arm with his great threat
_ as a runner to bewilder the opposition. Last year,

i in the Bruins rout of the Panthers, Beban com-
pleted eight of 13 passes for 100 yards and 1 TD
and rushed for 77 yards and two scores.

His top receiver will be split end Harold
Busby, a‘9.3 sprinter with good hands and the
ability to break a game Wide open. The Bruins

GARY BEBAN should be tough, although not quite up to last
year’s team. And, as Prothro exclai-ms, “if we lose Beban we are
going to be in trouble. Plain simple trouble.”

Sept. 30

The key to the Illini may very well be what effect the
slush-fund scandal will have on the team. Will it hurt them
or will it give them an ever stronger desire to win in order to vindi-
cate themselves?

‘ " Emotions aside, new coach Jim Valek has
inherited a squad that possesses size, depth, ex-
perience, and talent. Quarterback Bob N aponic, a
local boy, is one of the Big Ten’s best and the
rest of the backfield is just as good.

In all, seventeen of last year’s starters re-
turn, and many of them are being pushed by a
strong crop of sophomores. The Illini may go all
the way in the Big Ten if their spirit is willing,

    

W  NAPONIC because the flesh is certainly not weak.

The Mountaineers are basically the same group from

which the Panthers gained their only victory last season.

But to win that one, the Panthers had to stop West Virginia on the

two yard line as the clock ran out. And this year the game is in
Morgantovvn.

The big gun for Jim Carlen’s Mountaineers is senior tailback
Garrett Ford who rushed for 153 yards against the Panthers last
time.» ‘Another star is John Mallory, one of the nation's finest
safetys and possibly its best punt return specialist.

=Carlen’s big problem is at quarterback where none of the per-
formers‘ have turned in a consistently good job. If one of the

. . three signal callers comes through, the Mountaineers can be tough.

?tPanthers’ Opponents: Toughest Ever   ,.,.....,..

JOTTER PEN

. Army   d Nov. 18  

Tom Cahill’s debut as head coach was so impressive
that he was named Coach of the Year last season. With
of that squad back and ‘with Army's notoriously weak schedule,
Cahill can expect to at least equal last year’s 8-2~mark which in-
cluded a 28-0 win over the Panthers.

The sparkplug of'the Cadet attack is junior quarterback Steve
Lindell who won Sophomore of the‘ Year honors for his play last
season. Against Pitt he completed 9 of 16 passes for 156 yards and
two TD’s. He will have his top receiver, Terry Young, to throw to
again, but aside from Linde1l’s rollouts, the running game is weak.

Defensively the Cadets are always quick and aggressive and
this.year is no exception. Tackle Bud Neswiacheny heads the front
four, but the secondary is suspect, especially on long throws.

Ever since the Cotton Bowl team of 1963 has flound-
ered around the .500 mark. Yet in that period, in fact since

1961 they have not lost to the Panthers, winning last year by a 24-7

count.
Returning intact from that team is its most

potent offensive weapon, the passing attack fea-
turing quarterback John Cartwright, halfback
Terry Murray and split end Rob Taylor. Taylor
holds almost every Academy passing receiving
record and was on the receiving end of a 57 yard
scoring toss from Cartwright in last year's game.
As always the Navy defense will be tough
and fast. The line is experienced and is headed by .
All-East end Bill Dow. The one weakness is at JOHN
linebacker where sophomores are being called CARTWRIGHT
‘L:.*‘;*».__/,upon to man two posts. The Panthers played an uninspiring game
against Navy last time and,Hart is unlikely to let it happen again.

   

Penn State has been in a rebuilding ‘phase over the past
two years and this is the year the profits are expected to

show. The Nittany Lions have a host of seasoned veterans plus
some good sophomores including heralded fullback Don Abbey.

The Lions trounced the Panthers 48-24 last year, largely due Reg. $1.98
to the efforts of halfback Bob Campbell who rushed for 137 yards special Dkcgum Price  "
and three touchdowns. He returns as do quarterback Tom Sherman ‘
and fullback Dan Lucyk. Sherman will have two fine ends to throw

to -in Jack Curry and Ted Kwalick. S_ BINSTOCK ‘T |

 Can Varsity Soccermen Overcome Inexpelen

by JERRY GRUEBEL
An unpredictable soccer season begins this Saturday

’  against Frostburg at Kennard Field.

Coach Leo Bemis will be ﬁelding what he calls a “green”
team. Seven of last year’s starters vvi-ll not be in uniform in 1967.
Art Richardson (fullback), Al 'I‘-raunsteiner (halrﬂback). V1-mixie
Bartolotta (halfback), Jim Snyder (halfback), and Sal Tavares (In-
terior forward) have all graduated. Bill Zurzola will be kicking for
-the football team this year. Co-captain Bob Racunas, who lettered

as a sophomore last year, will
most probably be out for the
season with head injuries.
Shelton Zvuma, an African
player who lettered last year,
will also be missing from the
roster. He plans to devote full
time to  studies.

96,,-

JOE KRUTH
Fullback . . . new spot.

Filling the right wing position
vacated by Racunas has been
the biggest problem so far. “He
was our best potential scorer,”

Bemis said of his co-captain.

Ion Bagely, a junior who spent
the past two years at the Brad-

ford regional campus, had the

most talent of all the tryouts.
But he injured his foot in the
first practice session. Bag1ey’s
footisinacastnowandit
i'sn’t- scheduled to come off un-

. mwEmmnmm~
  at center forward as a. eoph.

til sometime this week. He won’-t
be in shape for the opening
game.

In last Friday night's scrirn-
mage with the alumni, Bemis
platooned six players at right
wing. None of them appeared
capable of replacing Racunas.

Besides a vacant right wing,
overall inexperience in the de-
fense is another tough problem
that will haunt Bemis. A lot of
young boys for our defense. In-
experience could hurt. After all,
a spohomore is a sophomore.”

The soccermen aren't all
“green." “Juniors Len Harmon-
and Dave Shimpeno are very
strong candidates for All-Amer-
ica,” claims Bemis. Shimpeno is
a center halfback who lettered
last year as a sophomore. Har-
mon is an excellent goalie. He
-looked particularly sharp in Fri-
day night’s scrimmage. The var-
sity played the alumni to a sur-
prising 1-1 tie.

Bemis is also depending heav-
ily on returnees Ernest Mouen,
IPete Snyder, Gary Foerrtsch, and
Joe Kruth.

Mouen appears to .be one of
the top men on the team. “Emie
is an excellent team player. He
is deceptive and he's a real good
tackler,” beams the coach.

Snyder, a senior who has let-
tered twice, will be back as leﬁt
winger. Foertsch, another sen-
ior who lettered twice, is back
as an interior forward. He is
the other co-captain on the
squad. Kruth, a senior center
fullback who lettered the year
before last, could provide experi-
ence on defense.

Last year’s team, which won
four and tied another in 11
games, was the ﬂrst losing soc-
cer team that Bemis has had
in recent years.

- With the professional
baseball pennant races draw-
mg to a close, another league
"opens its short, but exciting
'S..éason this week. The fra-
ternities open their intramural
season Thursday at Schenley
Oval.

A In this double elimination

',} tournament, the team with the

ptoughest pitcher, tightest infield

Aﬂalnd most powerful bats will

fqurickly come to the top of the

-"league. Last year's champs were

 Pi Lambda Phi in league “A”

Hand -Kappa Sigma in “B” league.

 Pi Lam, also the All-Frater-

{' nity Champs, was greatly hurt
I by graduation. Missing from the

_1967lteam are ace pitcher Shel-

5'-ly Bratman, first and second

ibasemen Greg Simmons and

__j_Mike Olsher and shortstop Bruce

‘M-an-tin. Returnees Dick Baum-

" gart (lf), Chuck Greene (rf),

’”and’Barry Mishkin (scf) make-

fup a strong, experienced out-

ﬁeld.

', Even though they are miss-

:-ging three-fourths of their in-

-..field, Pi Lam ﬁgures to be in

the thick of things as their team

depth will help ﬁll these spots

. and bring Pi Lambda Phi an-

/other league title.

S ‘Second place Phi Epsilon Pi

 -hopes to regain their 1965 cham-

'onship form and upend arch

val Pi Lam for the title. Phi

Ep was not hit as badly by

graduation and has experienced

players J eff Levkoff, Stan Leder-

Yrn-an, Brian Jontow and Bob

;: Madison returning in key posi-

ittionsl.

I Sigma Alpha Mu, last year’s

 third place ﬁnishers, ﬁeld a vast-

ly improved unit this season.

..Althougvh losing pitchers Stan
—S-mlokler and Bill Goren and

slugging third baseman John

Ungar, the Sammies are more

 than boosted by the additions at

 Dave Shear (pitcher), Larry

" "Ba.-rr( third base), Steven Ko-

f_teen (utility inﬁelder), and Ran-

dy Bergman (left ﬁeld).

4: Returnees Henry Gruner and
Marc. Diamond bolster the out-

ﬁelding while Smokey Feldman

has earned a starting job at sec-

ond» base. The only question
mark is catcher where Don
haeﬁtz seems to have the edge
over Roy Jacobs.

. -.The dark horse this season
could be the Zeta Beta Tau team.
They captured the All Campus
Softball Crown this summer,
and if the winning spirit con-
tinues they, too, can be right up
there with the leaders.

Other -teams who will be heard
from in league “A” play are
Sigma Chi, Delta Tau Delta,
Delta Sigma Phi, and for the
ﬁrst time in this league, Phi
-_Kappa Theta.

 League “B” titleholder Kap-
pa Sigma Sigma looks like a
‘strong contender to repeat as
league leaders this ‘year. They

guation and have strong men
such as Joe Deiterich (cf), Lar-
 Lesniak (3b), Dick Jones (rt)
