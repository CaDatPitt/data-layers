BOT ‘approves ()'Connor’s salary raise

By Christine Hanna

News Editor

Pitt Chancellor J. Dennis O’Connor will
receive $216,275 in salary this year,
approximately $5,000 more than he did
last year.

The Board of Trustees Compensation
Committee approved the 2.5 percent
raise yesterday after ﬁnishing its annual
performance evaluation.

Committee members said they agreed
that O’Connor’s performance in the past
year has been exemplary, but with the
strict budgetary times a 2.5 percent raise
retroactive to July 1, 1993 would demon-
strate a sign of restraint. '

“lO’Connor’sl guidance of this universi-
ty has been good for Pitt, good for
Pittsburgh and good for American higher
—educat_ion,” Board of Trustees Chair
Farrell Rubenstein said. “Our university is

today a brighter, safer, more open, more
academically robust place thanit was a

year ago.”

Rubenstein said O’Connor has kept
to an agenda “to strengthen an environ-
ment of intellectual excellence and ethi-
cal purpose  ﬁtting for a great American
university dedicated to preparing stu-
dents for life and careers in the 21st cen-
tury.”

E-Mail. No, it’s not the distant
cousin to the emu, it’s
Electronic Mail. E-mail allows
people across the world to com-
municate via computer.

Becoming more and more
popular on campuses around
the country, E-mail has Pitt stu-
dents following the lead as well.

Graduate student Juan
Zevallos—Aguilar belongs to an
E-mail networking system with
his colleagues in Latin America.
He said communicating through
E-mail, which is free, is cheaper
than using the phone.

According to Pitt computer
lab consultant Pak Seto, “Once
you get started, you just get
hooked!”

Mary Christianson is a fifth-
year senior and a first-time user
of E-mail.

“I was envious that ‘my
American friends in Germany
could use E-mail to communi-
cate with their friends back at
home,” she said. “I couldn’t sim-

‘\

long distance

ply because I didn’t know how

5 to use it.” *

Freshman Studies classes are
requiring first-year students to
get E-mail accounts to avoid sit-
uations like Christianson’s.

Not only are students imple-
menting this convenient com-
munication system, but so are
professors and student organi-
zations.

Several professors are requir-
ing students to open E-mail
accounts. The advantages of
using E-mail for classes are
numerous, Seto said.

Everyone knows how difficult
it is to catch a professor in his or
her office even during designat-
ed office hours, but E-mail can
be answered within hours and
even minutes, according to
Seto.

It is also a unique way to
obtain help from peers.
Students can ask each other
about assignments or notes that
were taken in class. Instead of
trying to catch that person at
home, one can send the mes-
sage via E—mail.

Pitt student organizations are
also catching on to the beneﬁts
of E-mail.

The Black Action Society is in
the process of publicizing its E-
mail address.

BAS Chair Keith Davis said

the BAS will use the program to
communicate with other black
student unions.
9 Students can also send mes-
sages to the BAS inquiring
about upcoming events, com-
mittee meeting notes or any
other pertinent information.

The Graduate and
Professional Student Association
also has an E-mail account. Its
E-mail address is GPSA.

According to'GPSA President
Steve Parks, who also teaches in
the English department, E-mail
is a valuable teaching resource.

“It is veryconvenient for an
entire class to have it to clarify
notes and homework, especially
for those classes that only meet
once a week.” Parks said.

The E—rnai1 system is a unique
and expedient way to commu-

nicate locally or afar, personally

-without tbeplaone bill

or for business.

It costs nothing. Actually,
your computer fee has already
paid for it. If you’re paying for
it, you might aswell use it!

Through E-mail people can
send, print, edit, store, delete,
file or forward messages as well
as receive them.

It is accessible through every
computer lab on campus as well
as other campuses and even in
different parts of the world. E-
mail systems can vary slightly,

but they all operate on the same

basis. ,

Each user has his or her per-
sonal address, which is corn-
prised of the username, an “at”
sign (@) and a host—name. _

The username is a code made
up of usually (but not always)
the user’s initials or a part or
parts of his or her name.

The components for the
address are separated by an @
sign.The last portion of the

address is the address of the-

computer.
A sample E-mail address would
be: “kjones@vms.cis.pitt.edu”

Pitt Sign Connection
teaches with bands

By Susan Lanzendorfer
For The Pitt News

Educating the campus about the Americans with
Disabilities Act, traveling to local hospitals and singing holi-
day carols with their hands, Pitt’s Sign Connection club
strives to bridge the gap between the hearing and deaf
world.

Sign Connection, Pitt’s sign language club, sponsors a vari-
ety of activities throughout the year in its quest to promote
deaf awareness throughout Pitt and the surrounding commu-
nity. " ,

Barriers are created by lack of knowledge, according to
Karen Walkney, the founder of the organization. To combat
these barriers, Walkney founded the group, which is devoted
to educating the public about sign language and the deaf cul-

ture.

A Walkney said she chose the title, Sign Connection, because
she was always saying the words, “We have to connect with
people out there.” A ,

‘One of the issues the club will tackle this year is the pass-
, ing of the American Disability Act and how it will affect the

general public. Walkney said she believes that education is
the key to breaking the barriers between the deaf and the
hearing world. I

Pitt responds to peace accords

By Shawn McClearn
Staff Writer

Ten years ago no one would
have dared think that the
Palestine Liberation
Organization and the state of
Israel would be making peace
within a decade. Funny how
times change.

The announcement of a tenta-

tive peace agreement between»

the PLO and Israel came sooner
than almost anyone had expect-
ed. The agreement has sent a
shock wave across the world so
powerful it has even affected the
lives of people living half a

world away. L
Kadir Gunduz, a doctoral stu-
dent in Pitt’s School of

Education and the imam of the
Muslim Student Association, said
that he anticipated a deal
between Israel and the -PLO but

he was still caught by surprise.
He pointed to the attempts the
PLO made to moderate its over-
all stance and the initiation of
direct negotiations between
Israel and Palestinian represen-

tatives in 1990 as the basis for

his optimism. —

B’nai B’rith Hillel President
Chuck Diener said that he was
very happy when the news first
broke. “I think this is a great
opportunity, not just for Israel,
but for the Jewish community
and the Palestinian community
as a whole.” V

He commended both sides for
their dedication and felt that
both sides had to continue their
efforts to foster an atmosphere
of mutual respect. “It’s not
gonna work if just one side
tries,” he said. I

Although initially optimistic,
Gunduz said the deal had a

major flaw.

, “I wish there was more input
from other PLO factions and the
Palestinians, especially those in
the occupied territories,” he

' said.

He said several residents of
the Gaza Strip were not in favor
of the agreement. “I would have
liked [the agreement] better if
the process had been more
democratic,” he said.

Wliile being satisfied with the
results ofthe negotiations in
general, Diener had a few prob-
lems with the way the issue was
covered by the media.

“The national news media has
given Israel minimal credit for
the great strides it has taken in
this process,” Diener said.

Professor Barbara Burstin’s
reaction was very optimistic.

For The Pitt News

While sitting in class in the
Cathedral of Learning, have you
ever glanced out the window
and seen a lawn full of camou-
ﬂage? Did you think you were
still in the middle of a daydream?

Well, it’s not a dream — it’s
real. It’s Pitt’s Army ROTC in
physical training.This year there
are 100 cadets enrolled in the
ROTC program. Sixty-five of
these cadets are here on some
kind of scholarship. Fifteen of
the cadets are National
Scholarship winners, which cov-
ers 80 percent of tuition or
88,000, which ever is more.

Lt. Col. Michael Cassetori, the
department chairperson, said, “It
is a great compliment that peo-
ple want to bring their scholar-
ships to our program.”

Unlike many other ROTC pro-
grams on other campuses, Pitt
does not offer incentives like
free room and board to scholar-
ship winners. This shows that
those students are here because
they want to be and not because
they get the best ﬁnancial deal,
Cassetori said.

Cassetori stressed that ROTC
cadets are students first and
cadets second. The two comple-
ment each other. As cadets, they
will learn the necessary skills
that help them become better

students. As students, they will
learn necessary skills to become
good officers. The average GPA
of last year’s graduating class
was 3.1, he said.

Right now the ROTC’s physi-
cal training is centering on get-
ting ready for the City of
Pittsburgh’s Great Race on
Sunday, Sept. 26.

The Battalion trains every
Monday, Wednesday and Friday
from 6:30 to 7:30 a.m. They will
all run together, except for a

special group called the Rangers

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, the
cadets attend Army classes. In
class, they learn the necessary
skills to become better cadets,
like leadership skills, first aid

ROTC concentrates on recruitment, leadership

and land navigation, said senior
David Ott.

“Now is the time [the seniors]
develop officer skills,” said Maj.
Beverley Ertman, assistant pro-
fessor of military science.

One of ROTC’s main projects
this year is recruitment. Despite
their hard work and good inten-
tions, Cassetori said, recruitment
has been down the last few
years.One reason is the talk of
Capitol Hill cutting down on the
military. “We are fighting the
image that we’re,going away,
but [in reality] the opposite is
true,” according to Cassetori. He
said the military needs low—rank—
ing officers.

Blaze/eline
focusing
on unity

By Matt Groff
Asst. News Editor

Unity and education
will be the focus of the
Black Line this year,
according to Black Line
committee Chair T anita
Harris.

She told students
attending last night’s
meeting that all types of
articles are welcome in
the monthly Black Action
Society publication.

“The Black L-me will try
to build a lot of hope
within the black commu-
nity at Pitt,” Harris said.
“We need to keep a
strong and active commit-
tee or the Blacle Line
won’t make it.”

Harris characterized the
Blade Line as a network
joumal which will update
Pitt students on the activi-
ties and resources open to
African Americans at Pitt.

In addition, the publica— _

tion will offer articles
ranging from politicsto
folk tales.

First-year student
Courtney Chisholm said
she would write about
certain problems which
go unnoticed by most of
Pitt’s students.

Harris said that every-
one could contribute in
their own way.

“Personally, I feel real
strong about African his-
tory and learning about
culture and heritage,”
Harris said.

She made it clear_that
the Blade Lz'ne’s goal is
not competing against
Pitt’s daily student news-
paper, The Pitt News or
against The ‘Black
Panther, a publication of
the BAS steering commit-
tee.

f‘ The Black Panther is a
bit more radical, a paper
where students discuss
problems informally and
tell it like it is,” Harris
said. “The Black Line will
concentrate more on
wh_at’s going on in our
community.”

She encouraged all pre-
sent to bring other writers
who are motivated to
write for such a publica-
tion.“ [BASl is a family. I

agreement, Burstin, a Jewish
studies professor, said she
was “amazed and just
thrilled.” She said the
announcement was especial-
ly uplifting when viewed in
contrast with the constant
barrage of stories detailing
conﬂict, despair and destruc-
tion. “It makes you feel peo-
ple can come together,” she
said. I ’

As the initial shock has
worn off, Gunduz has had
time to reﬂect on the signiﬁ-
cance of what has happened.
Gunduz said he is hopeful
but still somewhat hesitant.

He said he still sees areas
where there are major differ-
ences between the two sides
— such ‘as Palestinian access
to Jerusalem and the fate of
those living outside of the
occupied territories.

Gunduz said he hoped the
Islamic Center of Pittsburgh
would be able to engender
better communications with
Pittsburgh’s Jewish commu-
nity, and said there was even
a possibility of his group
issuing a joint statement with
the United Jewish Federation.

While he was pleased with
what has developed so far,
he said he is not so confident
about the future.

According to Gunduz, “If
[the Isr.1eli—PLO accord] leads
to the creation of a
Palestinian state with the

West Bank, Jerusalem and
the Gaza Strip, then I feel that
the prospects for peace in the
long term will be very
strong.”

Hopeful about the future,
Burstin looked to the agree-
ment-as proof that history
doesn’t have to repeat itself.
She said the agreement was
an important piece of
humanity as well as Middle
Eastern history.“I hope it will
demonstrate that all people
of different backgrounds can
resolve to live together in
peace,”Burstin said.

Diener said that he will
always lool? forward to
opportunities to keep rela-
tions with other ethnic
groups on a positive level.

He said he understood that

some people were less than
optimistic about the whole
affair because of their own
experiences, but that his gen-
eration’s outlook was a little
different. “Israel making
peace with the Palestinians
.will not secure peace in the
regionnin general,” Diener
said. He also said many
Middle Eastern conﬂicts are
separate from the Isreali-
Palestinian conﬂict.

Burstin said the future
holds a great deal of promise.
While she said she couldn’t
predict the future, she
believes the momentum of
recent events will carry the
drive for peace forward.

club offers minicourses for all
members free of charge. Other
activities include the Deaf
Awareness Function Fair, an ice
skating party, tutoring sessions,
games and lectures.

The first activity will be at the
end of October. Vice President
Sheri Barkey said the group will
be sponsoringga Halloween
party for deaf children.

Though different people cite
different reasons for getting

. involved in an organization,

Barkey said she has had person-
al experience with members of
the deaf world. ’

“I’m really interested in sign
language,” she said. “I have a
deaf godchild and had two deaf
friends in my elementary class.”

In past years, membership
has ranged from 65 to 70 peo-
ple.

Walkney said she hopes for
even greater numbers this year
and welcomesall who‘ are inter-
ested in learning more about
the deaf culture.

have gone to the SGB to do

they would hear me out, but I
doubt they’d act on it.” _

According to Brody, each stu-
dent concerns are important to
the board.

“lStudents] have elected us to
this office, and we have a
responsibility to act on the
problems they bring to us,”
Brody said.

Board member Ted Schroeder
went a step further and said stu-
dents can be part of the solution
to their problem.

“People seem to want things
done, yet depend on others to
solve the problem to their lik-
ing,” Schroeder said.He said

not realize how much they can
change by serving on such a
committee. In fact, eight out of
nine standing committees are
still open to applications,
according to Brody.

True to Schroeder’s state-
ments, committee membership
does not seem_to interest most
Pitt students.“I don’t have time
to serve on a committee, I elect-
ed them to SGB to solve those
problems,” Pitt junior Rick
Johns said.

_ “We can change things, but,
for instance, we don’t know
where most of the ‘people who
need shuttle service live,”
Schroeder said. “We can only
do so much by ourselves.” C

President Clinton’s proposed

he said. Students who would

have considered ROTC may opt

for civil service instead.
Cassetori said that although
recruitment is down that does
not mean the quality of the pro-
gram is down. He said these are
some of the best cadets the pro-

gram has ever seen.
Tuesday the cadets had their

Artist: Illegal

Album: The Untold Truth
Producer(s): Erick Sermon,
Diamond D., Colin Wolfe,
Spearhead X, Biz Markie and
Cool V, Lord Finesse, Dallas
Austin.

Label: Rowdy/ Arista

rating: @@@

The truth is out. There are
two 14-year—olds out of Atlanta
shakin’ up the other kid groups
in the industry. Lil’ Malik and
Jamal (aka Illegal) are rattling
cages in the business. Letting
you know, even though they’re
young in age, they catch wreck
with the best of them, and no
one in their age range can f‘"k
with ‘em!!

They took a loaded gun and
aimed it at your head with the
first single, “Head or Gut." On
this Erick Sermon funk-laiden
track, this group delivers a very
focused, rapid—fire style and
very tight lyrics which fall on

I point. It has metaphors that,

although basic, are still dope

,' because they fall into the beat

perfectly. And when that bomb
landed, it hit Chi Ali. On the B-

around

side, “We Getz Buzy,” Illegal
can dis most of the other kid
groups (like Immature, Da
Youngsta’s, The Famlee and
Kris Kross). Check the verse:

“I’m goin’ off because I’m Lil‘
Malik/and no suckers it’s not all
about maturity/Now if you want
beef I can cause a fuss/and no
little kids this ain’t nuthin’ for
Da Youngsta’s/You can’t even
see me/there’s no relation so it
can’t run in the Famlee/I’m still
the boss/‘cause I’m_ a straight up
nigga ain’t nuthin’ ‘bout me Kris
Krossed.”

Old school dissin’ on another
phat E Double track makes this
the joint!!

On the album, the element of
funk is there, but nothing really
stands out, but there are some
cuts definitely worth checkin’
out. “Lights, Camera, Action”
has a crazy, phat, jazzy bassline
over a heavy drum track. Basic,
but it’s the sh*t!! “Ban Da
Iggidy” is a dope, head—nod—
ding track that has big bass and
peeks of a horn riff over a slow
thumping beat. “On Da M.I.C.”
has a smooth, swinging~jazz
bassline which serves as the
core of the track with a drum
beat play around it. This track
also has a phat cameo by Lord
Finesse (now rollin’ with Puff
Daddy’s production company
Bad Boy Em‘ertaz'nmem‘) and

.A.G. (of S/oowbiz and AG).

With other cameos by Erick

Sermon and Diamond D., they

Staff Writer

This weekend the Three
Rivers Writer’s Conference
offers local writers, pretenders
and general literary folks a rare
chance to hear readings from
some big names and to
schmooze, nibble and jaw with
nationally successful and estab-
lished writers from Pittsburgh
and beyond.

Originally scheduled to take
place earlier this summer, the
two-day event was postponed
due to lack of response from
the public. By the time the
event was scheduled to take
place, only 14 people had regis-
tered. Not very literary. Planners
attributed this dismal showing
to Father’s Day hysteria and
general academic burnout
amongst the Pittsburgh intelli-
gentsia. The $125 registration
fee might have been another
discouragement. ''

Now, after reducing the cost,
luring in Pulitzer Prize winning
author William Styron and mak-
ing a few cuts to the line up,
planners have piqued interest in
the conference. Over 200 peo-
ple have already registered for
the event which will take place
Saturday, Oct.18 and Sunday,
Oct. 19 at the Carnegie Museum
in Oakland.

Out—of-town guests include
Styron, Joyce Carol Oates, and
Tobias Wolff. Pittsburgh writers
include: Jim Daniels, Sam Hazo,
Jane Bernstein, Patricia Dobler,
Lee Gutkind, Peter Oresick,
Jeanne Marie Laskas and Jane
McCafferty. The event was put
together by Pitt professor and
writer, Lee Gutkind. Writers will
not only read from their work
but engage in numerous panel
discussions (Audience participa-
tion is encouraged.) on a variety
of topics concerning writing
and writers. ' .

Here’s what’s going down,

Post-modern Romance, Money

True Romance

Written by Quentin T arantino
Directed by Tony Scott

Starring Christian Slater and
Patricia Arquette

Hailed as the next Scorsese,

A Quentin T arantino perched on

something of auteur status with
his brilliantly scripted Reservoir
Dogs. His new picture, True
Romance, (actually written and
sold pre—Dogs) may just put him
at the top of the film brat list as
one of the most intuitive writers
in “Tinseltown” today. It is

"important to stress this moderni-

ty since one of his skills
involves having a ﬁnger on the
pulse of 20th century “truisms”.’
It is this noir bent that displays
the manifestations of being
jaded by action-pumped
Hollywoodizations, love-con-
quering-all tales, soundbitable
quotes, the ubiquity of televi-
sion and iconically-brutal mob-
sters, mobsters with darkly-satir-

ical ﬂair.

tion. The plot itself has been

seen before. Yet, Tarantino deft-
ly weaves dialogue and action
so that it cleverly unfolds comic
book style before our minds.
Under the meticulous direction
of Tony Scott (The Hunger, Top

Gun), we get a story that sup-
ports the critics tag as being a
“Bonnie and Clyde for the ‘90s,”
but we also see a method that is

Money For Nothing

Directed and written by Ramon
Menendez

Starring John Cusack, Debi
Mazar and Michael Madsen

,Money For Nothing is a film
entirely about money. Not just
the plot, but the lines, cliches
and even the sex is about
money. Granted, this makes
sense with regards to the story,
and it may be that director
Ramon Menendez is trying to
emphasizce the impossibility of
separating the green stuff from
:lI1‘}’ of modern life.
I“\'lCI‘iC.1‘.»(lC>’. tzilqcs it :1 bit too far‘.
ll(,)\\'C\’L‘:I‘, and ends up with 3.
one—theme movie laden with
characters talking about Ben
Franklin and saying things like,
“Our ship will come in.”
Perhaps this abundance of dol-
lar references is the result of a
need for more-substance in the
movie itself. V The premise
(based on a true story) is brief.
Joey Coyle (John Cusack) is a
ne’er-do-well, down-and-out
dock worker living in South
Philadelphia who finds $1.2
million that bounced out of the
back of an armored truck. Joey
can’t handle his sudden illegal
affluence or the pursuit of the
law, and the film becomes your
basic chase scenario.

Buckeye rig

Battered
Panthers must
regroup to face
the 11th-ranked
Buckeyes

By Tom Schneider
Staff Writer

It’s hard to come up with the
right words to describe the Pitt
football teams current situa-
tion.

After a 63-21 shellacking at
the hands of Virginia Tech, the
Panthers could use some time
off to stop "the bleeding.

_ Unfortunately, they must pull

themselves together and pre-
pare for the invasion of num-

‘ ber 11 Ohio State, whom they

host Saturday.

I guess it’s a little like getting
run over by a garbage truck,
then getting up and walking
intothe path of an 18—whee1er.

And that big, bad Buckeye
rig is on a collision course with
a Pitt squad full of question
marks, particularly on defense.

“I 1 know that we can
improve,” head coach Johnny
Majors said.

“How much

[we will

improve] remains to be seen. b

How much we can improve 
well, there are limitations. We
don’t have the luxury of losing
people, but we lost. some peo-
ple [in the Virginia Tech
gamel.” _

In last Saturday’s loss to the
Hokies, the Panther defense
held together about as well as
a wet Kleenex while allowing
500 total rushing yards. And it
is even weaker now with start-

THE PIIT NEWS, PREGAME, Thursday, September 16, 1993

geared to take on beat up Panthers

They will be lined up against
an Ohio State offensive line
that averages over six-feet, five-
inches and 294 pounds.

In the defensive backfield,
Panthers’ right outside line-
backer Torn Tumulty looks
likely to start after an early
departure from the Virginia
Tech game. Tumulty left early
in the first half of last
Saturday’s game after falling on
his infected elbow.

“[Tumulty’s elbowl looks to
be improved,” Majors said.

“We probably shouldn’t have
played him [against Virginia
Tech]. He wants to play very
badly.”

Tumulty is currently tied for
second in the Big East with two
interceptions, both of which
came in the Southern Miss
game. 0

Tumulty and the pieced-
together remains of the defen-
sive unit will try to hold_off the
Buckeye attack and give the
Pitt offense, whoever may be
leading it, a chance to put
some points on the board.

After starting quarterback
John Ryan sputtered in the first
half» against the Hokies, Majors
replaced him with redshirt
sophomore Ken Ferguson, who
saw his first action in two
years. Ferguson subsequently
led the Panthers to two second
half touchdowns, and thus,
rekindled the battle for the
starting position.

“There's competition at quar-
terback 
along,” Majors said.

“Well make a decision who
will start later in the week."

Majors might not reveal until

game day who his starting QB
will be.

With junior running back Tim
Colicchio still sidelined with a
shoulder injury, junior Curtis
Martin will again be the go—to
guy out of the backfield.

Martin followed up his two-
touchdown performance in the
season opener against Southern
Mississippi by rushing for 140
yards and scoring one of Pitt’s
two touchdowns against the
Hokies. The 140 rushing yards
was the eighth 100 plus—yard
game of his career, and his 51-
yard TD run was the longest by
a Panther back in five years.

The Panther workhorse is
currently averaging 146 all-pur-
pose yards per game and is
third in the Big East in rushing
yards with an average of 104
per game.

more consistent, and I am very

Bucks feature five
290-plus pounders
on what some say
is the best line

in college football

Byjack Becker
Sta_[fWriter
Heading into Saturday’s

matchup against Pitt, the Ohio
State Buckeyes’ offensive line
must be smacking its chops in
anticipation after the Panthers
were trampled under the
Virginia Tech stampede last
week.

Virginia Tech, dominating as
it was, will never be mentioned
in the same breath as Ohio
State when it comes to the run-
ning game — Ohio State is
power football. And with
power football comes a wall of
muscle to lead the way.

In fact, things look so bad
right now that the Panthers
could very well be starting a
pony of a man opposite a mas-

— sive OSU line. This writer, at a

mere five-feet, ten-inches tall

and a slight 165-pounds,‘

received an offer from Pitt
defensive line coach Tom
Turchetta that no sports fan
could possibly refuse.

“Can you play defensive end?

We’ll put you in there,”
Turchetta said.
Defensive end? Wait a

minute. This one deserves a
second thought.

All consideration of this joke
of a statement ‘ ended as
Turchetta walked down the Pitt
Stadium tunnel laughing.

However, the fact that
Turchetta even joked about
such a thing shows the chal-
lenge Pitt’s defensive line faces
without Gerald Simpson at
linebacker (out with a knee
injury), and possibly without

Zatiti Moody and Dell
Seagraves — who are both
questionable. '

“This Ohio State team will
considerably be the best foot-
ball team we will have played.
I think they could be on the
verge of a great footba-114 ,

Pitt head coach Johnny Majors

said.

“So you see we have quite a
challenge ahead of us. But this
is going to be a whale of a
football team we‘ play on
Saturday.”

whales — killer whales —-— on

the offensive line?

Pomtbers’ wide receiver jells steps upas No. 1 weapon

l'_Keith Pompey
' Staff Writer

As long as Dietrich Jells has
been at the University of
Pittsburgh, everyone has been
saying that there is something
different about this speedster
from Erie, Pa.

“When I first methim I

‘I thought he was corny," senior

wide out Junior Green said.

:“He never talked to anyone,

but when he occasionally did
talk, he never made any
sense.”

But then Green and’ the rest
of Jells’ teammates learned that
he just possessed the signs of
being a ‘nervous rookie.

Now in his third season as a
receiver, there is still something

 .‘ different about Jells, something

that sets him apart from the

rest ofethe receivers on the
team. ‘

Jells is just beginning to tap
the unlimited potential that he

‘ has.

Last season, after the loss of
Chris Bouyer due to a neck
abnormality he suffered in the
Notre Dame game, Jells was

forced into a leadership role.

He responded .better than

expected — establishing two
Pitt single-season records for
receptions (55) and receiving

yards (1,091), while becoming
the Panthers’ first single—season
1,000—yard receiver. ,

Not bad for a‘ person who in
high school wasnt sure that he

was going to play collegiate
football. I

“I never thought of myself as
playing football,” Jells said. “I
always pictured myself as
being a track star. I don’t know
why I chose football over
track.” I

For a while, the Pennsylvania
State 100- and 200-meter dash
champion considered partaking
in both sports.

As a first-year student, Jells

competed on Pitt’s indoor track -

team, recording season highs

of 6.41 seconds in the 55 ‘

meters and 21.89 seconds in
the 200 meters — enough to
qualify him for the IC4A
Championships in both events.

Nevertheless, the reality of ~

being a student-athlete struck,
and he decided to drop track.
“I chose last spring just to do

football because I wanted to
concentrate more on that
sport,” Jells said. “I felt I_need—
ed to work on my technique.

“Also, it is really hard to play
football then run track, as well
as managing your academic
career and your social life. I
realized it to be a real heavy
burden.” ' A

After having a superb season
a year ago and devoting this

September 16,1993

past spring to just football, Jells
was expected to have an even
better season this year.

Some experts have even
gone as far as naming him an
All-American candidate.
Because of.this new—found
recognition, Jells knows that
different defenses will try to do
whatever is possible to stop
him. I A

“Last year, I didn’t have
added pressure on me because
it was the Chris Bouyer show,
and plus, I was coming off my
freshman ‘year so no one
expected anything from me,”
Jells said.

“Now every time I step on
the field they know I’m there
 they design coverages to try
to stop me.”

The effects of special atten-
tions and double coverages
have cut his statistics but have
helped open up'Pitt?_s running
game. »

“As long as we are successful
and winning, 1 can take the
loss of receptions and
yardage,” Jells said. “I will try
to do anything I can do to help
the team.”

Now only two games into
the season, the same people
who picked him to finish the
season as an All-American are
beginning to change their
minds, wondering if Jells, who
obviously misses graduated Pitt
quarterback Alex Van Pelt, can
fit into Coach Majors’ ball—con—
trol offensive.

Combining the speed of a bull and the hands of a tailback, Jeff Cothran does it all for the OSU Buckeyes.

By Stephen Flinn

Staff Writer

The following is an explana-
tion of an offensive back as
defined in the Sportsman’s
Encyclopedia.-

A football team plans its
offense according‘ to the materi-
al on hand and particularly on
the type of backs on hand. A

I back is selected for his ball—car-

rying ability. The ability to gain
ground is a first consideration.
Speed is also essential and a
must for a good back. Size is
also a factor as big backs can
run through and over oppo-
nents. Also, today’s backs l1ave
many blocking duties. -

.The previous definition is

taken from a sports resource

guide written 30 years ago. But

description from the 1995 Ohio -

State Media Guide of the
Buckeyes’ starting fullback, Jeff
Cothran, because Cothran is the
textbook definition of what a
fullback should be.

Cothran is known in the foot-
ball arena to have the complete
package, because he not only
has the power of a bull, but the
speed and quickness of the
matador. -

He entered his freshman sea-
son at OSU weighing “only”

220 pounds, but has since

bulked up to a meaty 242
pounds‘, while being able to
maintain his speed.

His massive size and speed is
not going unnoticed by Pitt
head coach Johnny Majors.

“Their [OSU] fullbacks are

‘only’ 242 pounds and 250
pounds,” Majorssaid sarcasti-
Cally. -

Cothran, who also started at

J fullback last year, is the only
OSU All-American candidate
who is a ball-handler and one
of only four All-American can-
didates on this_year’s Buckeye
squad — along with offensive
lineman Korey Stringer and
defensive linemen Dan
Wilkinson and Jason Simmons.

He was selected second—team
All—Big 10 by last year’s confer-
ence coaches and was also
voted honorable mention by
the sports media for the 1992
season in which he rushed for
410 yards and gained 617 all-
purpose yards. He accom-
plished this feat while being
utilized primarily by OSU head

coach John Cooper as a block-
ing back.

“When discussing our back-
field, our startingtailback is
Raymont Harris, and he works
well in conjunction with our
starting fullback, Jeff Cothran,”
Cooper said.

Cothran has always been an
all-around guy since he starred

at Middletown High School in .

Middletown, Ohio. Cothran
also started' for his high school
basketball team on the same
squad with Jimmy Ratliffe who
plays basketball at Ohio State.
He was selected All-State and
All-American at Middletown, as
he rushed for 1850 yards and

21 touchdowns in his high

school senior season alonein

 , Asst. Sports Editor

September 19, 1992: the Pitt
men’s soccer team upsets one of
the Big East’s best, Seton Hall,

‘ tin a3-2 win at Pitt Stadium.
" The win is Pitt’s third Big East

victory in a row. It not only sets"
the tone for what will become its
greatest season in history, but
also garners the team some-
thing invaluable in the league
— respect.

‘November 6, 1992: Seton
Hall, playing with the intensity
and ardor of a team scorned,
auenges its earlier loss by
defeating Pitt 5-] in the Big.
East post—season tournament.

‘against the Seton Hall Pirates,

last year’s conference runner-_

-ups, the Pantherslhave yet to

But the team is far from

— after taking it to- The Hall in
one of the biggest wins in
school history last season. It’s
just a question of execution.

“We can play better than we
are, but we’ve played hard,”
head coachjoe Luxbacher said.
“We justhave to sustain it
now.”

The Panthers, who possess
enough offensive talent to
power three Division II

goals (to opponents’ five). I

one of the league’s best one-
two punches in Gerson
Echeverry, a senior who has
scored a goal and two assists
on only six shots this year, and
Carmine Pascarella, who has

notched three points (one goal,

one assist) on four shots.

Echeverry, who will probably
be marked by Pitt midfielder
Charlie Wasson, and Pascarella
have a combined 183 points in
their college careers.

“A lot of kids have stepped
up and are ready to play,”
Noethling said. “If we keep up
the way we’re playing into
[Seton Hall], I think we’ll be
alright.”

“It’s not my job to tell how
Pitt’s [going to do], but they've
got a very good team and
they’re very organized,” St.
john’s Coach Dave Mazur said.
“From top to bottom, the Big
East is very close and I think
they’re going. to give [Seton
Hall] a ‘game all the way
through.” ‘

The Seton Hall game begins
a slew of tough Eastern oppo-
nents —- at Seton Hall,
Providence at home on Sept.
26, at Villanova on Oct. 2 and,
finally, at home for Boston
College on Oct. 10 — the
Panthers will have to play in
the next month.

“We’ve got a tough sled of
games ahead of us these next
weeks,” Spitzer said. “We’ve
got to get through it but we’ll
be alright.”

“We think we can compete
with these teams, but we just
have to sustain it through these
tough times,” Luxbacher said.
“We’re struggling a bit now and

we’re a little unsettled, but I’

think we’ll be alright.”

THE PITI‘ NEWS, PREGAlv£E, Thursday, September 16, 1993

By Ryan Buncher
Senior Staff Writer

Just" over two years ago,
Sarah Ward and Brigitte Laurey
graduated from Columbia
Heights High School in Fridley,
Minn. A

A year later, Sara Mitchell,
now a women’s volleyball play-
er at Pitt, did the same.

This weekend all three will
come together at the Hofstra
Spalding Classic tournament at
Hofstra University, all on differ-
ent teams. Ward is a middle
blocker for North Carolina, and
Laurey plays for Wisconsin.

“I’m excited because I
haven’t had a chance to play
against them since I played
with them,” Mitchell’ said. “Also,
it’s a chance to see how they’ve
been doing.”

Mitchell and the Panthers (4-
2) enter the weekend with a
four—match winning streak. The
Panthers dropped only one
game in three matches as they

won the DePaul Invitational '

I

last week.

“We left off doing well at
DePaul,” Mitchell said. “The
Competition will be tough
because the teams we will be
playing this weekend are better
[than the ones at DePaull.”

The Panthers will open their
weekend against the host
Flying Dutchwomen tomorrow
at 7:30 pm. Hofstra lost one
starter from a team that was 15-
14 last year and are 5-3 so far
this season.‘

Last weekend, the Flying
Dutchwomen placed second at
the Miami (OH)
University/Days Inn Classic,
beating Miami and Western
Illinois and losing to Alabama.

Senior co—ca_ptain Jan Furlow
is I-Iofstra’s top hitter (66 kills).
The team has also gotten an
immediate contribution from
rookie Sarena Syphers (56 kills
and 20 blocks).

Hofstra has lost all five-of its
previous meetings with Pitt,
including a 15-12, 7-15,. 15-8,
15-12 Panther victory last
October. .

The last time Pitt faced
Wisconsin three years ago, the

Badgers were a top-20 team,
and the Panthers were just_

starting to establish a national
reputation. Pitt upset .Wisconsin
and stretched top-ranked UCLA
to five games in the opening
weekend of the 1990 season.
The Panthers went on to win
the only NCAA tournament
match in their history, a first-
round Victory at Ohio State.

The team Pitt will face
Saturday is a long way from the
top—20.,A coaching change‘
brought a whole new team, a
young groupthat finished 14-
17 last season. The Badgers
were picked to place sixth in
the Big 10, one of the top
women’s volleyball conferences
in the country. _

Wisconsin is 4-3 so far this
season, including a three—match
winning streak entering the
weekend. Among the losses

was its opener against defend-
ing national champion
Stanford.

Junior outside hitter Jeanna
Grotenhuis is the top attacker
for Wisconsin, averaging 4.46
kills per game. The Badgers
have only one senior,‘Kristen
Sebosinski (2.5 kills per game).

Pitt finishes the weekend
Saturday night against the

University of North Carolina,
The Tarheels were 19-14 last
year, losing in the semifinals of
the Atlantic Coast Conference
tournament. They are 4-3.
“'We’re looking forward to
one of the strongest matches of

the weekend being Pittsburgh,”

North ‘Carolina Coach Joe
Segula said. “They’ve had a tra-
dition of being an excellent

program with good coaching.
[Ann Marie] Lucanie is an out-
standing player. She’ll present
some problems. I expect
Pittsburgh to be a real tough
match.”

North Carolina is still playing
quite a few players and settling
some positions. Sophomore
Michelle Miller and redshirt
first-year player Laura
Gremillon are still competing
for the starting setter position.

“This could be a weekend
where one may find herself on
the court more than the other,”
Segula said.

He also said there is no ques-
tion that Pitt is the favorite in
the tournament, but not by
much.

“I’d be surprised if one team
dominates [the tournamentl,”
Segula said.

SERVES AND VOLLEYS:

Lucanie was named the Big
East Player of the Week for her
play at last weekend’s DePaul
Invitational in which she also
earned tournament ,Most
Valuable Player. She sand-
wiched strong matches against
Portland (eight kills, 21 digs)
and DePaul (21 kills and a .514
hitting percentage) around a
dominating performance versus
Western Michigan (19 kills, 3
aces and 23 digs). ‘

Lucanie is third in the Big
East with .88 aces pergame
and second with 5.31 digs per
game. Setter Annemarie
Mernagh leads the conference
in assists (13.3 per game).

of playing at that level,” Owens
said.

Stringer, the Big 10 Freshman
of the Year last year and All-
Big 10 choice to boot, is in fact
already at “that” level.

Kline has been compared to

I former Buckeye and NFL All-

Pro Jim Lachey.

With OSU’s size, experience
and talent, it is among the
nation’s elite offensive lines.

“We use that as a challenge.
We don’t take that as fact,”
Owens said. “We just try to live
up to the tradition of Ohio

State lineman.”

The Panthers, though not in
awe, certainly respect what
their up against this weekend.

“The offensive line‘ is real
solid. I expect them to be one

V of the best we’ll see in a long

time,” defensive tackle Tom
Barndt said.

After the complete break-
down Pitt suffered defensively
against Virginia Tech, what can
be done to improve the results
and certainly to ensure that the
same results don’t occur against

team?

“We can improve our tech-
nique. We can get ourselves
mentally ready
Turchetta said. “And we can
attack instead of sitting back
and waiting for something.”

“If we would execute what
we were told to do, we would
get penetration,” Barndt said.
“Until we get to executing fun-
damentals the right way...
putting in extra stuff won’t,mat-
ter.”

Even if fundamentals need
work and injuries are taking a
heavy toll, don’t expect a
Johnny Majors’ coached team
going into battle without any
fight. .

“The Tom Barndt’s of the
world will never quit,” Majors
said. “You can put him out

there and he’ll fight the whole

way.”

Bamdt holds the same views.

“I expect the team to fight for
some pride Saturday and that
alone should make us look
more respectable."

Injury did not stop Cothran I

from excelling then, and did
not stop him this past sum-
mer either, as he had minor
opcrations on both knees
£1flL‘1' last year’s season."

“I did not do any hitting

during spring drills but man— J
aged to come back feeling ’

good for this year,” Cothran
said.

So even though he took no _

Cothran has had on the 

Buckeye squad this year can

E 

best be summed up by  

Jonathan Evans, another OSU
student who came from
Cothran’s high school.

“I remember when Jeff ran  V

for 21

touchdowns at I

Middletown. He is one of

OSU’s best players. He is a
good runner and a great
blocker. He’s a real team

leader and is just a_n all-

said.

BY‘ NOTE'S: Cothran start-
ed one game his sophomore
year of college, while playing
in all 12. He rushed 43 times
for 283 yards, netting 281.
He averaged 6.5 yards per
carry, and scored a pair of
T Ds for John Cooper.

better, however, as he started

yards, netting 410 .He fin-
ished with a 4.2 yards per
carry average, and scored
three touchdowns.

While he is an obviously
accomplished , runner,
Cothran, as stated above, is
also an excellent pass catch-
er. He, in his first year,

for Pitt in 1976.

' “We moved
Dorsett to receiver
for two reasons,”
Majors said. A

“He hasn’t made
the progress we
would like for him
to make at defensive
back. Plus, we need
competition at cer-
tain positions, which ‘

Cont from page P-4

“Everybody is compar-
ing the stats from last
year and are probably
saying what is wrong,”
Jells said."

“[They’re saying], ‘He
got the ball such and
such la number] of times
last year.’ ‘What they for—
get is last year at this
time I only had four
receptions for 108 yards,
then I just exploded. It’s
hard to compare this sea-
son to last year’s because
you don’t know how a
game could go. We can
go into a game and they
could totally shut down
the run and that will

I force the pass.”

The coaching staff is
well aware of the fact
that it has been "difficult
to get Jells the ball.

“We would like to get I

him the ball more often,
but right now, we are
limitediin what we can
do,” receivers coach
Steve Bird said of Jells,
who has caught only six
passes for 100 yards to
date.   '
“We want" to get the
ball in the hands of the
best people we have.
Right now that is Dietrich
and Curtis Martin."_ _
Although jells is getting
most of the attention,’ he
believes the other wide
receivers could also
make major contribu-
tions. ’
“Lately so much atten-
tion has focused on me
as a receiver,” jells ‘said “I
don’t think my fellow
receivers have been get-
ting their fair due. I think
we have some of the best
receivers in the Big East.”

draws attention to other inade-
quacies as well. The emotional
level of the entire film operates
on one frequency, as does the
level of suspense. The film only
superficially touches on Joey’s
relationships with his girlfriend

l Monica Russo (Debi Mazar) and
brother Billy Coyle Uames
Gandolfini). Also, despite the
fact Joey is running from the
law, the suspense never builds
enough for us to get nervous
about the whole thing. This is
partly because Joey himself isn’t
exactly a ‘genius and leaves
enough clues that what brings
about his downfall is painfully
obvious. Had Menendez and
his screenwriter cohorts con-
centrated more on developing
relationships and building the
suspense, the picture could
have been above the shiny, ﬂat

By Mike Shanley
Senior Staff Writer

Garage music never claimed
to be an original or creative.
Laying claim to a sound built on
three chords (four, max), the
music limits itself from the out-
set. '

It’s easy to make the music
sound good, and even easier to
make it sound ﬂat and lifeless.
For that very reason, there
exists an abundance of crummy

b a n d s
banging
out the
same old

. 1-4-5 chord changes over and

over with absolutely no new
soul in it.

Gas Huffer is one of those
bands that takes a simple
garage style and jump—starts it
to add new life. The quartet
hails from Seattle, but it recalls
more to do with the punkabilly
sound heard on Slash Records
in the early ‘80s than its home-
town’s fashion plate, hype mon-
gers you’ve been reading too
much about. Since 1989, the
band has released two albums,
an EP and appeared on several
compilations and split 7” sin-
gles.

Integrity, Technology and
Service, the band’s latest album
on eMpTy Records, recalls the

. gritty drive of the Blasters. Tom

Price’s guitar work lays down a
solid foundation which he pro-
ceeds to dance all over when he
solos. ‘

On top of that, the 13 songs
on the album provide the inspi-
ration for a mosh pit. The

ance of the kids and the pros.
Although these kids can ﬂow,
when they try to be “so hard
that they scare themselves,” it’s

not believable. I know that kids
nowadays smoke ism (slang for

weed, marijuana, etc.), drink ‘

brews, have sex and tote guns,
but it’s something about these
“similak gangstas” that I just

can’t get with: They’re at their,

best when they kick freestyle
lyrics. In addition, some of the
tracks can’t handle the weight.
Truthfully, I wish Erick Sermon
would have produced the
whole album. An assortment of
producers makes the album less
focused and makes it have less
continuity. 4'

Don't sleep on these kids
because the skills are there.
Hopefully next album, they’ll
come a little more correct and
really get down to Illegal busi-
ness.

The ‘90s so far has" been the
decade of the dance hall artist,
and it doesn’t stop now.
Although, when listening to reg-
gae, you have to have a distinct
ear todecipher what's the funk
and what’s straight up garbinoll
The same thing goes for hip-

repeated thrash tempos some-
times blur one song into anoth-
er. Gas Huffer provides more
dimension by expanding the
musical palette.

Far from a serious band, the
quartet looks and sings like a
bunch of palookas. Vocalist
Matt Wright, who sports a seri-
ous set of muttonchops, hulks
around like Quasimodo. Songs
like “Do The Brutus” (an
homage to Popeye’s-adversary)
and “Overworked Folk Hero
Guy” prove the band eschews
the standard “ooh—baby-ooh-
baby,” garage—lyric clichés. “The
Piano Movers” takes the ridicu-
lous idea of a bunch of guys try-
ing to move a set of 88s and

- comes up with a masterpiece,

complete with “heave ho’s”
appropriated from the Laurel

_andHardy film on the same

subject. -

Apparently, Gas Huffer has
been spending a lot of time on
the road.

So by the time the group tum-
bles into Pitt’s student union
tomorrow night, it ought to pos-
sess the trapping of a well-oiled
rock machine.

And if Gas Huffer doesn’t give
you a good enough reason to
start the weekend early, the
Cynics, another purveyor of
powerful garage from our own
backyard, will warm up the
show.

This band rarely plays in
town, let alone at an all—ages
show, so don’t miss it.

The Karl Hendricks Trio and
Blunderhuss will open up the
show at 7 pm.

in clubs and in jeeps. A definite
that should blow up massively
is “Gun Pon Cock.” Nardo
freaks this track like a nympho
in the summer. This is a definite
club crusher. Louie Rankin
shows that he’s a veteran in true
form. On his album he rocked
“Typewriter,” but here, “No
Move” is the ﬂavor. The new-

‘ comer to watch for is Reverend

Baddo. His cut, “Bop Scuchie,”
shows he can hang with the
best of them. -

The only beef I had with this
album is that some of the newer

artists couldn’t cut it. But even '

then, the tracks save them and
keep you listening. I’m not
much into reggae, but I had to
speak on this album. It’s dope
 ‘nuff said. ’

O’Connor was com-
mended for the new
bottom—to-top budgetary
process, the five-year,
multimillion-dollar class-
room and lab enhance-
ment project, ‘improve-
ment in campus safety
and cultural diversity.

Also at the meeting,
O’Connor gave his rec-
ommendations for Pitt’s
senior officers’ salaries.
These recommendations
were accepted by the
committee.

Pitt’s highest paid offi-
cial is Dr. Thomas Detre,
senior vice chancellor. of
Health Sciences and
director of Western
Psychiatric Institute and
Clinic, who also received
a 2.5 percent raise. Detre
earned $391,000 last year
and this year will earn
$400, 775.

Although the university-
wide salary pool was 2.9
percent, most senior offi-
cers received a 2.5 per-
cent increase, except for
tWO.

Vice Chancellor of
Student Affairs William
Harmon and General
Counsel Lewis Popper
both received a 2.9 per-
cent increase.

O’Connor was formerly a senior
administrator, earns $137,320.

And President John Lombardi
at the University of Florida will

Mattison said the University'of
Pittsburgh Medical Center might
someday offer all necessary ser-
vices for students.

“Whatever the student wanted
to do, he would be able to do,”
he said.

Pitt’s Forbes Clinic Manager
Jan DeVoe has some reserva-
tions about the plan.

“One very big concern is with
regional alliances. What about
students coming to Pitt from
New York? What will be the
availability oflcare?” DeVoe

Some things are created to leap almost anywhere.

The cost of a college education shouldn't be one of them.

 

said.
DeVoe, president-elect of the
American College Health

Most students would jump at the chance to be on a scholarship that pays for
your tuition, books, and related fees. That is exactly what you can do in the Air
Force ROTC program. We have scholarships that can pay up to three years
worth of these college expenses. We have a scholarship program for virtually
any major. If you're a minority or majoring in nursing, pharmacy, physical
therapy, environmental (civil) engineering, or computer science / engineering; we
could get you an Express Scholarship--possibly within three weeks! If you are a
sophomore, no matter what your major, you could be awarded a scholarship
worth up to $5,800, starting next fall. We also have two and three year
scholarships for many “other majors in engineering, ‘science and math. I toad
you about scholarships, but the Air Force ROTC has much more than $ to offer.
We participate in numerous activities on and off campus—everything from trips
to Washington, DC tocatching a ﬂy’t on an Air Force jet. You will alsd leap
right into a job after college, with a starting salary of over $23,000, increasing
to $43,000 after 4 years. So get off your pad and hop over to the 29th ﬂoor of
the cathedral and ask for the Air Force ROTC. Or, you can give Capt Fisk a
croak at 268-5184.

Association, suggested universi-
ty health services, might
form cooperatives with each
other. ‘

“(T he Student Health Service
provides] primary care at a rela-
tively inexpensive rate,”_ she
said. , - '5 I '

But she acknowledged that
student health services may
close altogether. . _

“One of the best parts of col-
lege services is that we do pre-
vention,” DeVoe said.‘~'“Is there
funding for that?”

Preventative care such as cho-
lesterol screenings and Pap tests
will generally be covered by the
health plan.

I Unnecessary expense.

The current economic instability in America calls for X

moderation in spending wherever possible, whether it
be personal, corporate or government ﬁnances.

Vice President Gore’s current plan to reinvent govern-
ment, although calling for the elimination of some
250,00 federal jobs, is to many a step which America
must take. h‘ V _

The University of Pittsburgh is no exception.

The Pitt Board of Trustees’ Compensation Committee
approved a 2.5 percent raise for Chancellor J. Dennis

' O’Connor yesterday in addition to other pay increases.

But the fact remains that prior to O’Connor’s pay
raise, he "was already earning roughly $211,000, which
is more money than many of his counterparts across

the nation.

Not to mention the fact that he is provided with a
beautiful home as well as a driver at no expense.
Penn State University President Joab Thomas was last

I reported to earn $200,000, and "Chancellor Paul Hardin

at the University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill, where
O’Connor was last employed, earns $157,320. _
The list goes on.
, West Virginia University, $106,000; University of
Florida, $197,000; University of Michigan, $180,000;
Ohio State, $160,000; University of California at
Berkely, $175,000- .
And interestingly enough, the top official at Berkely

_ took a 3.3, percent pay cut last year. Looks like there’s

some fiscally-sound folks out there.
According to the Jan. 27 issue of The Chronicle of

~ Higher Education, the average salary for top adminis-_

trators at colleges and universities in the United States

. last year was $99,225. O’Connor earned roughly 112

percent more than the national average.
.- Farrell Rubinstein, the chair of the Board of Trustees,

said yesterday that “Chancellor O’Connor has articulat— ‘

ed an agenda with speciﬁc goals to strengthen an envi-

_ ronment of intellectual excellence and ethical purpose

 ﬁtting for a great American university dedicated to

l preparing students for life in the 21st century.”

Maybe so, but isn’t that what he’s being payed for?
Surely other programs in need of funding could use an

- additional $5,000 this school year more than O’Connor

can.

O’Connor was further commended for his leadership,
which has resulted -in a safer Oakland according to
Rubenstein. He mentioned the new lighting around
campus and the new shuttle system. .

However, Rubenstein failed to mention the fact that
the Department of Public Safety’s budget was cut soon
after O’Connor’s arrival at Pitt a few years ago, and stu-
dents now pay a $35 transportation fee every semester
to offset the costs for the new shuttle system. _

Fiscal conservatism’ is the sign of the times. It’s time to
make some difficult choices. Unfortunately, the Board
of Trustees doesn't ‘see it that way.

Students must take initiative

This title, however unfortunate, holds much

‘truth. As a first-year student, I have noticed a

great deal of dissention betweenlthe Black Action
Society and The Pitt News. x

All of our checks are written out to the same
place. All of our paraphernalia says the same
thing. We are all a part of the same institution, the
University of Pittsburgh. With this

disagreed with what Oscar had to say, but by
right he is entitled to his opinion without being
attacked for stating it. In the same respect, The
Pitt News cannot publish anyone’s opinion if they
are not giving that person’s opinion to publish. If
the fear of stories getting distorted is there, then

get people on the staff that you are willing to talk

should not be a constant back and
forth contention between the two
organizations.

but your own. It is us that has to

both student organizations for the
students and by the students. They ,
need each other, contrary to popular belief. The
Pitt News’ job is to inform the student body about
campus events, news and other related material.
The BAS‘ job is to give the information to The Pitt
News for students to know; all of the students to
know.Almost every other edition of The Pitt News
has something negative about the BAS or Oscar
Eybers in it. The BAS then complains that what
has been published has been terribly blown out
of proportion. Not everyone may have agreed or

take the initiative to go out and
write. No one is invited and no one
is denied. How can any one persons’ or groups’
views be expressed if no one says anything? The
same thing goes for when a problem arises. As
stated at the Indaba, do not sit with a group of
friends and complain about something if you’re
not doing anything to help solve it. We have to
stand together and get our message out. Keep
being good to each other. 4

Stiflea’ nee/e women still creative

Black women, who lived during the time of
slavery, were some of the most creative and
strongest women ever to live. But because of the
evil ways of slavery, black women were forced to
find alternative ways to express themselves.

In Africa, before Africans were stolen from their
homeland, women played an important role in
the creative expression and education of their
family. 5

When black women were made

these times is a given. Still, to assume that black
women ceased to be creative is as ridiculous as it
is untrue. 0
Although most black women could not read or
write, they could sing, sew, bake, and they were
amazingly skilled at the greatest art of all, the
“art” of motherhood, often caring for their own
children as well as the children of their owner.
A few were taught, or taught wrongly,
and wrote and expressed them-

to be slaves in this country, they
were cheated of the rightto be
educated and the right to possess
the means and materials to create
and thrive as women.

Michelle
Babkes

selves with a European view,
cheated of their own heritage. This
was an attempt by the Europeans
of that time to erase all sense of
pride in black women, about who

But there is something else we
must realize. For even the few
black women who were taught to read and write,
therefore, given the means to create, they were
warped into feeling negative about their own
past and heritage.

These black women were taught a strictly
European view of life, in which, they had no
place but that of a slave. This greatly affected
black woinen’s art, self-image and self-expres-

gsion, just as much as. the lack of an education

did. V
' "It was considered a serious crime for black
women to read or write, let alone to paint, draw
or sculpt. But this misdirection and lack of educa-
tion did not result in the inability for these
women to create._ * _

The inability of black women to express them-
er:-lvec in the fnrmc nf naintino nr .<(‘1Ilﬁl’ﬁT dnrina

they were, where they came from
and their wonderful creative abili-
ties. .

Still, black women found their own way to
overcome this physical and mental slavery and
tried to make sense of the cruelty and injustice
that so greatly inﬂuenced their expression.

I close this piece in the hopes that not just
black women, but all women and men, realize
the strength, creativity, wisdom and beauty that
all the black mothers of our past possessed. With
this understanding and respect, may we all re-
educate ourselves to the reality that these are the
same qualities that black women possess today.
For just as Africa is the “Mother Land,” so have
black women been the mothers of the world and
