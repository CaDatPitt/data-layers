cational Opportunities Program.

Theconsultant is Dr. Shepherd L. Witman, who will continue as
Director of the Office of Cultural and Educational Exchange.

On the need for this program, Dr. Litchﬁeld commented: “There
has been a shocking disregard of America’s educational responsibility
to her Negro citizens. This‘ neglect isapparent, and an appalling re-
flection on our society, The University has been closely involved with
the general welfare of the community in urban renewal, economic
growth, and public policy. It must now move into the area of human
resources and human development. It seems to me that every majo
social institution should be concentrating on what; it can do for th
Negro citizen."

 

 

Program Outlined»

The program as outlined, by Dr. Litchﬁeld will include: Systematic ‘

identiﬁcation and recruitmentof able Negro students; visits to homes

inviting church groups and other civic-minded people to join in the
effort; a campaign for additional ﬁnancial aid; pre-college counseling

Increased; Loan

Money Made Available to Students

ln an effort to bolster enrollment for the spring tri-
mester, the University has announced an increase in course
offerings and availability of additional federal loan money

for the term beginning April

Chancellor Litchﬁeld noted that while the overall num-

22. ' ‘ .

during the Winter and fall terms,,there will be an appreciable
increase over the number and variety given in previous

A

spring terms. V

“There also will be more senior

‘Percentage Increase V
, According to the Chancellor,
liberal arts offerings will be up
more than 13 percent over last

distributioncourses and many core
and honors courses.

Course offerings in the Schools
of Engineering .and Mines will
be up 10 per cent over last
spring, covering almost 80 jer
cent the scope of the winter pro-
gram. . ' .

In the Graduate Division of the
Social Sciences and graduate hu-
manities_ program course oﬁerings
jump to 25 and 50 percent, re-
spectively, over last year. ‘Semi-
nars and guided private study
courses will continue at a high
level in the former program,
while the latter includes two visit-
ing Andrew Mellon Professors, one
each in Classics and German.

tional Aeronautics and Space Ad-
ministration Program and a sub-
stantial increase in the size of the

-gNatural Science faculty will en-

able the division to “provide
money for every graduate student
continuing his education through

i _ the spring trimester.”

Chancellor Litchﬁeld explain-
ed that deans and department
heads have spent more than six
months revising the curriculum
to provide students with desired
or required courses.
“Overlapping and conflict be-
tween courses,” said the Chancel-
lor, “have been almost totally
written out of the spring sched-

A ule.”

Additional Loan Money

In discussing ﬁnances, the Chan-
cellor pointed out that the Univer-
sity anticipates enough‘ additional
loan money under a National De-
fense Education Act (NDEA) loan
program to proviw assistance for

all qualiﬁed applicants.

Jack B. Critchﬁeld, director of
student aid, explained: “As re-
quired by NDEA, students in

._ ‘critical areas’ —— chemistry,
physics, mathematics, biological
sciences, modern languages and
education —- will be given first
‘priority. However, we anticipate
that funds will be available to
the extent that all full-time, de-
gree-seeking students can be
helped.”

He added that a student who

obtains aloan in the spring can be

reasonably’ assured that the loan

,will- continue in the fall.

. Incidental Advantage

The Chancellor pointed out that
one incidental advantage to stu-
dents attending this spring/. would
be the opportunity to take addi-
tional course work before the pro-
jected $100-per-term tuition in-
crease takes effect.

Two surveys of students and

ifaculty played a major part in

promoting action toward th.e
spring term. The most recent sur-
vey, Student Government’s Tri-

 mester Report, indicated only one-

third of students polled voiced
satisfaction with past spring term
setups. . “

 

' Brother-Sister

Program Given

A New Structure

"The International Brother—Sis-
ter Program has been restruct-
ured to make it more valuable.

Every effort is being made to
assign American “brothers” and

I “sisters” to the International Ex-

change Students as ‘soon as they
are accepted.

The American can then write
to his “brother” or “sister” abroad,
advising him what, to bring, de-
scribing campus life and activi-
ties, and answering any questions
the foreign student might have.

The American students make
the foreign students’ ‘arrival in

' Pittsburgh easier by helping them

to get to know the campus and
community.

‘ Participants are c h os e n by

In The Spotlight

tvith Stan Schiveiger

If Pittsburghers ever halt
.rom celebrating February 12
as Abraham Lincoln’s birth-
day, they can always refer to
that date as “Tom Jones
Day.” At long last, the much-
heralded film version of Henry
Fielding’s masterpiece of English

18th century life has‘ arrived at

the Squirrel Hill theater and every
to a record-
breaking run. "The managers have
even brought back the matinee
performances, ‘ which shows how

much faith the proprietors have in

the box—oPﬁce .power' of “Tom
Jones”.

To be very blunt about the
thing, “Tom Jones” is clearly
deserving of the awards that
have been showered upon‘ the
film, which include such coveted
accolades as the National Board
of Review’s Best Picture of the
Year and the New York Film
Critics Award as 1963’s Best
tMovie. It will probably be the
odds-on choice to snag this
ycar’s Oscar. There is a deﬁnite
problem . involved when a re-
viewer makes the statement,”
“This is the best ﬁlm I've seen
in years!” or “It’s the ﬁnest
made movie in recent years!”
People- generally tend to look
down upon critics’-who are so
vehement in their praise of a
ﬁlm or play and when these
sceptics go to see the ﬁlm the
pervading atmosphere is one of
a. “show-me” attitude.

Hence it becomes a matter of

'care and ‘tact in trying to write

a review aboutpa film that de-
serves -to be praised to the sky. I
will try to show some restarint
and if I -go overboard then please
forgive the enthusiasm: “Tom
Jones” runs almost two and ‘a half
hours but you could never tell.
It moves so swiftly and buoyantly
across the screenthat the robust-
ness and energy of the players and
the creators can’t help but take
hold of the audience. The ﬁlm
grabs hold of you and keeps you
glued until director Tony Richard-
son thinks that you’ve had enough
and then lets/yousgo back to your
haunt thoroughly exhausted from
the workout. ‘

The ﬁlm, yrhich traces the
career of a charming and ro-
guish young man named Tom
Jones, is beautifully done from
every angle. John‘ Osborne has
taken the -monumental Fielding
tome and adapted it onto the
screen with the gutsy, rollicking
flair of a screenwriter who
seems to have relished in his
duty. All of the fun; droll, racy,
risque, earthy, and downright
hilarious comes through to the
audience in so many moments
that many of 0sborne*s lines are
lost. Osborne's characters are
the visual reincarnations of
Fieldingfs fancies and the adap-
tation nfust be considered among
the ﬁnest creations to be shown.

' Albert_ Finney has ‘received
mention in this column before and
chances are that his name will
crop up again before the year is
out. As “Luther” on the New York
stage, he was magniﬁcent. As Tom
Jones, the illegitimate young
scoundrel with the penchant for
sex and frivolity, Finney is bril-

liailt. He is sly, cunningly devious,
loveable, amusing, and surefooted
in his actions and moves about the
English countryside with the dash
of Flynn or Fairbanks. His facial
expressions and fox-like‘grin are
coupled with a delightful inno-
cence and naivte to spell outstand-
ing ’acting’and a wonderful per-
formance. ~.

All of the other cast members
are equally outstanding. .As the
outrageous "Squire Western, Hugh
Grifﬁth shows why he is one of
the best character actors in the
trade. The scene at the dinner
table and the fox-hunt foodfest
show Griffith as a robust, earthy
Englishman whose energy is likely
to remain at its peak forever. His
every action reeks with scandal
and mayhem and the actor brings
-his character to life with genuine
‘realism. Susannah York, as Sophie
Western, is, rightly innocent and
lovely and a fine mate for _Finney’s
Tom. Others who add to the de-
lightfulgoings-on are Joyce Red-
mond, Joan Greenwood,‘ Peter
Bull, and a host of very talented
British performers. It is a cast
whose energy and vivaciousness
can’t help but come across to the
audience and '_thOS€ who don’t
catch the fun will be losing out
on plenty.

In the other categories there
is much to be singled out. The
color photography is gorgeous
and there are some scenes, part-_ .
icularly those of the hunt, which
are breathtaking. The sprawling’
countryside has never been bet-
ter photographed and the effect
is like that found in anairplane’
journey. The music .is rollicking
and tuneful and the costumes

are in the great 18th century
tradition of garb, both law and
high class. -V

The real hero. of “Tom'Jones”
is the director, Tony Richardson.
I can’t help but go overboard in
my parise of this man because his
job is perfect in every detail of
scenery, in every nuance of dia-
logue, and every expression of
character. He molds the perform-
ers’ to bring as much life as it is
posible out of one character
and his rolling camera picks
up every facet of" these people and
the English environment of the

_18th century. Mr. Richardson’s di-

rection of the actors is full of life
and that vigorous quality is never
let up at any point. -

I think “Tom Jones” is the ﬁnest
film I have seen in the past year
and can’t recommend it highly en-
ough. As screen entertainment it is
wonderful and the people at the
Squirrel Hill would_ do wise in
setting up‘ another _ticket booth" to
appease the thundering hordes

who will be swarming all over the

place from here on in.

 Editorial: Summertime . . .

‘,:L’.:_.‘:Vv?§... /.',’)_.r_, A‘._v_",,  ,

Well, the University has ﬁnally come to the inevitable conclusion that if the entire

* concept of the third trimester is to become a success, it’s going to have to put itself
out on a ﬁnancial limb and expand the courses available during the Spring Term in the
hopes of attracting more students to regis ter.

In the past it seemed that the University was going at the whole thing in a rather ,
backward manner, a limited program was offered and it was hoped that as more and
more students registered, the number and quality of the courses could be increased.
Well, the students realized that they were not receiving the best the University had to
offer and the trimester has not been the substantial success originally hoped for.

The decision of the Chancellor to expand the term may, however, encourage
many students to take the third trimester who would have otherwise gone home in April
and forgot about the whole thing. ‘

‘. According to the new program, the selection of courses offered will be expanded
and a larger percentage of top-notch professors will be retained during"the summer
months than was previously done. i _

In the pasta student went to register for the third term in order to,graduate
a term earlier only to discover that a required course was’ not being offered-or that a
second-rate instructor had been hired to teach a co_u’rse'in his major. Under the new
program,‘ the chances of this happening will be lessened. Although the summer term
will ‘not yet be as complete as the other two, this is certainlya step in the right direc- '

tion.

  In ‘order to bolster the sagging third term, the Chancellor is also reminding

students that this will be a good time to go trimester before tuition goes up in the fall,
and that there will be more money available for loans this term thangever before.
The University is almost saying: Please come to school this summer. We started this
trimester business and it wouldn’t look good if it ﬂopped here of all places. We’re
giving you ‘more courses, better instructors, and more money. All we ‘want is-for a
few more of you.to register. That’s not so very much to ask . . .' is it?

The reaction to this should bea resounding: No! It certainly isn’t too much to

This summer term is going to be a real bargain and every student who can pos-
sibly do so should try and attend. For the ﬁrst time since theinstitution of the tri-
mester system, the University is out to make a go of it. The cards are all dealt out and
both the students and the University stand to makea grand slam this summer.

, Should the above sound con-
fusing, the reader can be no more
confused than members of above-
mentioned Lambda Sigma Rho
must be in their struggle for re-

cognition. The social fraternity has

been trying in vain-since Septem-
ber to reach Enwright et al., ﬁrst,
for recognition as a student or-
ganization on campus, and second,
for consideration by IFC.

The fraternity has been fractur-

A ed by silence on both counts.

To begin with, Lambda Rho is
a local fraternity. Its Alpha Chap-
ter was organized -at Johnstown
College of the University of Pitts-
burgh nearly three years ago.
(Note: Johnstown College is a
regional of the University, and
legally—speaking, Johnstown Col-
lege is the University.)

A’ school year heretofore the
fraternity, with eight members
on the Oakland Campus, ap-
proached the then assistant dean
of men requesting recognition.

Not enough members, they were
told.

Come September 1963, 17 broth-
ers decided it was time they start-
ed an Oakland Chapter and even
went as far as to rent a house for

: a meeting place. As it will happen,
I someone or other decided it was
 time to talk turkey with Enwright,
3 who, in turn, indicated his willing-
5 ness to consult with the dean of

men as to how to stuff the turkey.
Together (one might assume) they
concocted the following stuff:

——Tell your members to pledge
to another fraternity already esta-
blished on campus.

—Try to be recognized as an-
other type of organization other
than a fraternity. ' ‘

Not wishing to sever the bans
of brotherhood and not wishing
to be known as a Boys’ Club or
Oakland's Singing Chowder So-
ciety, the unrecognizables began
accepting fall pledges.

' With four new prospective
members in the fold, the group
turned a hopeful ear Enwright’s
way. But: coming from a regional,
the group QPA would be too high,
hence, creating a shoo-in bet for
IFC scholarship honors; mostly all
juniors and seniors, hence, unfair
challenge in athletics; and apt to

relegate itself in its own clan of»

personage. Break up the Yankees!

Still unrecognized, the group has
added nine more as pledges and
has inducted the four from last
term. The fact that everything it
does is unrecognized in the eyes
of the University seems to have
had little bearing on its social
solidarity. Yet it remains to be
seen whether or not Enwright will

What’s Enwright waiting’ for?‘

The big problem, according to En-
wright, is the assimilation of an
entire group into" the Oakland

Campus. The matter of individuals

transfering from regionals and re-
ceiving equal opportunity in stu-
dent affairs is being dealt with
at length by administrative per-
sonnel, he said. He called the mat-
ter involving Lambda_ Sigma Rho
a “special case,” however, since it
involved a group rather than an
individual. I
Just how long does it take to
solve a “special case?” Says En-
wright, it will be dealt with
“very shortly,” which is like say-
ing “If I had a slice of bologna,
I would make a bologna sand-
wich — if I had two slices of
bread.” The fact is, a number of
‘student organizations have done
much already in confronting the
existing problem with regional
transfers, while others, knowing
it exists, have done little, and
still others have shown their
ignorance toward the matter.

In regards to Lambda Sigma
Rho, which has been recognized
by Johnstown College (which IS
legally-speaking, the University),
perhaps it would have been better
— certainly quicker -— for all con-
cerned to bypass the preliminaries
and appeal the. case before IFC,
a group which has pledged to “eli-
minate the petty differences -that
exist within the Greek system that
make it weak.” Excelsior!

the basis of a free, democratic

therefore is voted into office.
‘Decreasing the number of Sen-

the Senate less representative

ate abolishes the clause which
states that all Senators shall

have more respect for. them-

their affection for each other '

Long-Range Program

The University is working in
close co-operation with the Ur-
ban League to develop a, long-
range program to compensate for
some of the economic and social
disadvantages of Negro students;
motivation and preparation of
able high school students of col-
lege potential; counseling of high
school students on higher educa-
tion as a goal and long-range ef-

pfort to improve early school pre-

paration of able students.

Dr. Witman emphasized his
position as one of co-ordinat-
ing University and city efforts
for broader educational oppor-
tunities. . He said, “Our re-
sources will not be limited to
Pittsburgh N e g r o e s, however
we want to start where we
are now on a manageable lev-
'el, with a group which» feels
a sense of identity and has
special problems.”

He continued: “We hope to
establish a close working rela-

’ tionship with the p eop le in-

volved in this program. It should
develop in a well-rounded way
to provide maximum educational
as well as job opporunities.
These twin targets should bene-
ﬁt both the University and the
city.”
 Group Cooperation

On group cooperation Dr.
Witman added: “We would like
to continue to work with inter-
ested churches and fother civic

«groups, such as the Urban League

and the National Associationfor
the Advancement of Colored Peo-
ple. However, we do not mean
to exclude other underprivileged
groups from future beneﬁts of

this program.”

Dr- Witman has ‘supervised
much cultural and education-
al exchange work at the Uni-
versity. In 1962, his oﬁice di-
rected the training of 110 Peace
Corps candidates for Liberia.
His ‘efforts led to the founding‘
of the Pittsburgh Council for
International Visitors and the
Regional Council for Interna-
tional Education, which asso-
ciates 29 colleges within a 250-
mile radius of Pittsburgh.

He organized and directed the
fir s t International Residential
Seminar at Bryn Mawr College
and headed its counterpart in
Munich, Germany. The French
government has awarded him the
Chevalier Cross of the Legion of
Honor for his contribution to in-
ternational understanding through
international education activities.

Bradford Campus Moves Ahead

Under President, Community ‘

(This is the first in a ser-
ies of articles about the
University’s regional cam-
pus at Bradford. The
writer, regional campus co-
ordinator for The Pitt
News, has recently return-
ed from a visit there with
students, faculty and ad-
ministrators. This article
and forthcoming ones will
reflect the impressions" she
received on hertrip.)

A year ago this month the Uni-
versity’s regional campus at Brad-
ford was no more -than an idea.

' Today through the organizational

ability of its president’ and the en-
thusiastic support of the commu-
nity the Bradford campus is. a
reality.» Its existence holds differ-
ent meanings for different people.
For some, it is an incentive, for.
others, a stepping-stone, and still
others, a salvation. '

After the appointment of Dr.
Donald E. Swarts as president of
the ' Bradford campus, strange
things began to happen. What ap-
peared to be a bubble suddenly

became a balloon. Fund-raising
activities were expected to net a
maximum of $542,000, “a lot of
money for a. small town,” in the
words of Dr. Swarts. Final totals
reached $758,000. ' A
Administrators set 100 students
as a goal for \the ﬁrst year. Full-
time enrollment last term reached
130. No plans were made to attract
out-of-state students tlntil Dr.

_Swarts decided in the spring that

they are necessary. “If this is. go-
ing to be a real college, students
learn as much from each other as
in classes,” said Dr. Swarts.
Ended With 40

He decided to try to enroll ten
to 15 out-of—state students and
ended. up with 40, including 23
from New York; New Jersey, 9;
Massachusetts, 8; Connecticut, 3;
Illinois, 2, and Vermont, 1.

Pittsburgh Officials

Within the past couple of weeks two out-of-town
sportswriters have called Pittsburgh a town where it is
virtually impossible for a visiting team to win in. The
articles appeared in papers in West Virginia and Phila-
delphia.

The West Virginia writer, Mickey Furfari,.made his
charge after the Panthers beat
West Virginia, while Stan Hoch-
man of Philadelphia leveled his
criticism following Duquesne’s de-

feat of LaSalle.
Both writers have touched

biggest fault of college-basketball.
The fact that-.a home team is us-
ually given ,a ten point. edge over
the visitors in college basketball
isn’t due strictly to the familiar
surroundings. A lot of it has to
do with the oﬂiciating. -
Pittsburgh isn’t the only tow

 

BOB SMIZIK

vwhich has drawn this criticism. When Duquesne had

some of the best teams in the country in the 1950s they
always had trouble winning at Dayton and Cincinnati.
Officiating was frequently to blame. Just this weekend
the Panther.basketball team outscored Syracuse from
the ﬁeld by four points, but lost the /game by 12 points,
at Syracuse, of course. The Orange had 49 chances from
the_ foul line. .

Collegesin this area have tried to make ofﬁciating as
fair as possible by forming the Tri-State Association for
the selection of oﬁicials. This organization, headed by
Dave Fawcett, assigns ofﬁcials to all local games. The
officials at tonight’s Pitt-West Virginia game will be as-
signed out of Fawcett’s office. They were picked before
the season started, as are officials for all local "games.

Tries to Vary Assignments‘

Fawcett has a list of local oﬁicials to pick from. He .

makes out the schedule before the season starts, trying to
vary the assignments as much as possible. If a team has

' a dislike for a certain official they will notify Fawcett

of this, but this doesn’t necessarily mean that that official
won’t be assigned games to the team that doesn’t want
him.

On the other hand, schools ask for certain officials.
“We like to have Red Mihalik a couple of times a year,”
said athletic director Frank Carver, “but he’s so busy that
we’ve only been -able to have him once this season.” Be-

side being a tri—state ofﬁcial Mihalik works games in the ‘

Big Ten, Atlantic Coast Conference and Southern Con-
ference. ’

But as fair as Fawcett may try to be, there will al-
ways be trouble. Santa Clara probably went back to
the West ‘Coast complaining about the officiating in
Pittsburgh after they played Duquesne. In that game
referees Earl Ceh and Cliff Fair distinguished themselves
by not calling a technical foul on Willie Somerset when
the Dukes’ star kicked a basketball into the stands.

It’s not hard to see how Furfari and Hochman got
the idea for their criticism.

Pittpourri /
Michigan State wrestling coach Grady Peninger -had’

.this to say about Mike Johnson: “Every time I see him I

cringe.” Michigan State’s heavyweight, Homer McClure,

‘who stands 5-foot-9 and weighs 245 pounds, never played

football despite his great size.

Syracuse promises to have one of thebest team’s in
the East next year with a freshman team which averages
6—foot-6 and is led by Vaughn Harper, tabbed to be a
sure all-America. Publicitymen at Miami and Duke are
already sending out rave notices on Rick Barry and Jeff

Mullins in hopes of making them all-America. t

Panther track coach Carl Rees explained his team’s
loss to Navy this way. “They had a pep rally early in
week and were really up for us.”

-The Duquesne freshman ﬁnished last Saturday’s
game with only four players. '

Assistant intramural director Tom Jones deserves
credit for running one of the smoothest intramural lea-
gues here in many years.

Pittsburgh Weekly Sports’ stories-concerning local
basketball players who have made good, at other schools
makes a reader wonder how so much talent got away

from this area . , . t ._ . g 1-, -

and increased its record to 13-8.

Lastyear at Morgantown, the Panthers de-
feated West Virginia, 69-68, and went on to
the NCAA tournament. -The.’ Mountaineers

« would like nothing better than to defeat the
Panthers and dim their chances of -any post
- season action. . ’ -

"Panther coach Bob Timmons said, “I know
it’s tough to win ‘on’ the road, but we did it at
Morgantown last year and there is no reason
why we can’t this year. The team knows the
value of this game. It’s probably the hardest
game left for us this season.” _

Much of.the burden for a win tonight falls
on the shoulders of Brian Generalovich. The
General played his best game of the year at the
Field House against West Virginia earlier in the
season. His best gamesthis year have been on
the road. ‘

Paul Krieger will be the Panthers’ other key

man. Krieger‘ has performed below par of late,

reserve Brian ‘Fisher (light shirt) looks on.’

’ but has a habit of playing well against West Vir-

ginia.--He won the game at Morgantown last
season, outplaying WVU’s Tom Lowry. Krieger
also outplayed the,6-foot-8 Lowry at the Field
House this year. _

Cal Shefﬁeld, the -Panthers’ most consistent
performer this season, and Dave Roman had
good games-on. the road this weekend and‘ are
ready. The ﬁfth starter, Dave Sauer, like
Generalovic-h, Krieger and Roman has had
both good and poor games this year.

Sauer, 1ike'Kriegér, has played well against

‘West Virginia since his freshman year. The Pan-

thers will need Sauer’s reboundinggand scoring

if they. are to make their record 14’-5. V
West Virginia’s big man, ‘Lowry, has per.

formed sporadically this year; however in the

last ﬁve games hehas. led the Mounties in scor- .

ing and rebounding. He and the rest of the team
have become “a more agressive unit,” according

‘to West Virginia coach, George King.

‘ After the loss to the Panthers here earlier‘

King said, “Pitt just outhustled us. We weren’t i

aggressive at all and until this team starts
getting tough they're not going to win many
games.”- Since _the Panther game,'the Mounties
have taken King seriously.

A '_.,,After tonight's game the Panthers host

Syracuse on Saturday and Temple on Wed-

nesday. The Temple game ‘will be played on

February 19, the time when tournament

bids begin to be extended. '

If,_however, the Panthers are toreceive any
mail they will have to win tonight’s game.

Stan Falenski Proves Instrumental In Keeping _
Freshman Basketball Squad on Winning Track  

   

"By KEITH SACHS

The success of the fresh-
man’ basketball team this
year has surprised many fans
here. But Stan Falenski, the
player who is perhaps most re-
sponsible for the ﬁne showing,
isn’t at all surprised. 
“I felt from the beginning that
we had a good team,” he said.
‘‘All of the players have been
working together for the beneﬁt
of the team as a whole the entire
season and the desire to win has
always been the foremost thought
in our minds.”

Falenski, who stands 6—foot-2
and weighs 175 pounds, hails
from nearby Latrobe where he
was a standout at Derry High
School. In four years, he carried
7 athletic leters, receiving two
letters in both football and golf,
‘and three in basketball.

During - his la_st- two’ '

  

  

ea’ s,_ h -

averaged 2$ points a game, and
his senior year, he was named to
the second string all—state team.

Stan received over 40 scholar--

ship offers including bids from
Oklahoma and Michigan, but he
chose Pitt for both academic an
personal reasons. -

“I think Pitt is a ﬁne school-

and oﬁers opportunities for an
excellent education,” he‘ said.
Stan is curently in Liberal Arts,
but hopes to follow a pre-dental
course. Falenski also admitted

that his older brother inﬂuenced A
his decision to. some extent. Dick '

Falenski, who is now a junior in
dental school,

and now coaches the J.V.’s.
Falenski, though ‘bothered a
good part of the season with a.

tained playing hiéh school foot-
ball, nevertheless _ has been

Lends, Encouragement to Team

Runner Bill Del Vecchio Shines
On Drab Panther Track Squad

By MARVIN ZELKOWITZ

If this were Greece, and track coach Carl Rees
was awarding laurels instead of praise, Bill ‘DelVec-
chio would be an ivy patch. '

DelVecchio,who runs the 50-yard dash, the 160-
yard dash, the 220—yard dash and runs with the mile
relay team, is the team’s strongest runner in each event.

Last year as a sophomore, DelVecchio was the track
team’s most valuable member, according to Rees. “He wasn’t
only the most valuable man point-wise,” Rees said, “but he
gave the other squad members encouragement.” As last
year’s track season progressed, the ﬁve-foot-nine DelVecchio
grew in stature in ‘the minds of his teammates. By the end
of last season, he, along with hurdles man Joe Friend, was
an acknowledged leader on the track team. ’

'He deserved to be an acknowledged leader. He was
the best sprinter in the East last season. In the NCAA
track tournament last season, DelVecchio ﬁnished fourth
in the nation in the 100-yard dash, and led all Eastern

,sprinters. A ~

DelVecchio has maintained the stature he, gained last_
season, "and, according to Rees, has assumed the responsi-
bilities that go with his position. “He’s always giving en-
couragement to the other kids on the team,” Rees said. ‘.‘He
cares about the others on, the "team." He’s-always givingi
them suggestions on how to improve . . . and they listen
to him, too. . - .

“They listen to him because‘ he knows what he’s‘ talking
about, and he has the’ performances to prove it,” Rees said
“He’s already '/run the hundred in 9.4 seconds.” , V

Unlike most runners, DelVecchio is not a “born
runner-.” ‘_He has bow legs. He" is short. “But he _has
strength,” Rees said, “and he works hard. He’s'always ‘_
up here (at the Field House). If he isn’t running, h'e’s‘_
lifting weights. DelVecchio is always trying to build
himself up, and improve his weaknesses.” -

And DelVecchio has weaknesses. He is not .a’sr'nooth
runner. His starts aren’t, strong or instantaneous. But he
works at approaching his potential.

DelVecchio, then, is not one of those track men who
would be just as valuable laying rails for the Baltimore and
Ohio. He is a runner who “has always done a good job”
according to Rees‘: The rest of _the track teamois like a lazy
playboy. They have the potential, but lack the desire to _
put. it out. DelVecchio puts out all he can, all the time.
