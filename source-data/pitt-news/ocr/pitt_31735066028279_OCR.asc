Health insurancesystem straps students

By Alexa Seretti
For The Pitt News

A 21-year-old college student
pleads with a Pitt pharmacist to
let her buy a half dose of her
anti-depressant medication. She
doesn’t have the $100 it will
take to get a whole month’s pre-
scription.

This scenario plays out ‘over
and over again in doctor’s
offices every day, because an
alarming number of college stu-
dents have no health insurance.

“It scares me to think of howl
would afford my medicine every-
month if I wasn’t covered under
my dad’s insurance,” said Kate
Rosenberg, a Pitt senior.

Rosenberg said she is unsure
of what she will do when she
reaches the cut—offage of 22, or
graduates from college and can
no longer depend on her parents’
health insurance plan to pay for
her prescriptions.

At least students at larger col-
leges and universities have gen-
eral practitioners at their disposal
for things such as colds or ﬂus.

V These services are provided to

every student and paid for
through their tuition.

But students attending smaller
trade schools don’t even have
this option because there are

usually no health centers affiliat-

ed with their schools.
“Health insurance is the last

thing on my mind after rent and
tuition and everything. I just
hope I don’t get sick,” said Brian
Nicholl, a student at the Art
Institute of Pittsburgh.

Up until about two years ago,
no health care provider in
Western Pennsylvania even
attempted to offer any kind of
program tailored to meet the
health care needs of college stu-
dents at a price they could
afford.

Blue Cross of Western
Pennsylvania created such a pro-
gram in 1992, designed to
accommodate the needs of
“independent young adults with
little or no income.”

In conjunction with

Pennsylvania Blue Shield. the
Blue Cross Special Care pledges
to cover 100 percent of hospital
and medical expenses. The only
general guideline that seems to
exist is that an individual cannot
make more than $13820 a year.
which would include most col-
lege students.

Enclosed in the Blue Cross’s
application for the Special Care
program are more speciﬁc crite-
ria. Special Care only covers ser-
vices performed at certain hospi-
tals. and the doctor performing
the service nrust be a Blue
Shield Participating Provider to
receive any of the benefits. In

Copy Cat
doesn't recycle,
students say  

By Scott Emmert
Staff Writer

Though small in membership and new to
campus, the Pitt Student Recycling
Committee hopes to tackle what it per-

' ceives as large and long-standing problems

with recycling throughout the university.

Chief among the issues that the commit-
tee hopes to draw attention to involves the
Copy Cat photocopying ,center on Forbes
Avenue and a law titled Article 101.

Article 101 mandates that large institu-
tions suc-h as Pitt recycle all paper and
cardboard.

“Copy Cat doesn’t recycle, nor do they
use recyclable paper,” says committee
member Matt Brady. '

“Everything we‘want to do through the

etuni-versity has to be through Copy Cat,”

says committee member Kristine Corvin,
referring specifically to the printing of club
ﬂyers and advertisements. '
University-sponsored clubs receive
accounts through Pitt with Copy Cat for all
club printing purposes. According to

‘Brady, none of the paper used for these

purposes is recyclable.
Although the Recycling Committee is not
yet certified as a club, the concern is for the

- mass of non-recyclable paper generated by

campus clubs using Copy Cat’s services.

“This is a huge arena for recycling at Pitt, O

and it’s not being utilized,” Corvin says.
«Brady says that committee members

hope tomeet with university .officials in the

futureto attempt to rectify the problem.
The committee is also interested in

improving "general recycling practices in’

university housing and academic buildings.
According to Corvin, the recycling recepta-
cles themselves obstruct effective recy-
cling. , F
“We wanted to have recycling bins stand
out,” Corvin says, suggesting that these
bins be colored blue and gold. “but it has to
go through the - Aesthetic Review
Committee, who wants everything to be

‘' neutral and brown. I . V

Panther)/thms sing Ct capella

By Jeremy Rausch.
For The Pitt News

The Pitt Pantherhythms _

are tuning up for their
upcoming concert on Oct.
28. The concert,
“Acapella Acapittsburgh
Acatober.” will be the first
concert of the year for the
eight-man subset of the
Pitt Men’s Glee Club.

“A capella,” according
to Webster’s dictionary, is
a form of singing where
the vocalists do not have
instrumental accompani-
ment. To members of
Pantherhythms, a capella
is more than that.

“A capella is a huge
thing  it’s a lot of fun,”
said fourth-year club

member Martin Lewison.
“‘It’s a hugely popular
form of music without any
instruments.”

Weekly rehearsals in
Pitt Music Hall are filled
with energy as the mem-
bers gather around the

piano to begin’ practicing

songs from a variety of
music. The group covers
more contemporary a
capella than the classical
Glee,Club repertoire.

Members choose all the
music they will perform
and the order in which it
is performed.

“The difference between
the Pantherhythms and the
Glee Club is that
Pantherhythms not only
select their own reper-

toire. but we arrange it.“
said Pete Hummon. a
first—year member of the
group.

This freedom of choice
leads to an interesting
repertoire for the concert.
The list of chosen music
includes songs by Eric
Clapton, Michael Jackson
and the Eagles.

“ A c a p e l l a
Acapittsburgh Acatober“
will be in the William Pitt
Union Assembly Room on
Saturday at 7:45 p.m. The
show lasts one musical
night only.

Concert tickets may be
bought in advance at the
ticket office in the
William Pitt Union for the
$1. or at the door for $2.

-From page 1

erage, which doesn’t include
prescription drug beneﬁts, dou-
bles for married students, even
if only one person wishes to be
covered.

Sue Ann Papst, director of

_government affairs at Blue

Cross. said that these exclusion-
ary tactics are necessary in order
to keep the price of health care
from sky-rocketing.
— “If we let everyone into the
program that wants to be in the
program, the price of health care
increases for everybody,” she
said. I

She also said that Blue Cross
recently added a “pre-existing
condition” clause that is includ-

ed in its other programs. It _

means that forpthe first 12
months of coverage, Blue Cross
Special Care will not pay for the
expenses related to an illness for
which a physician gave treat-
ment within a year before the
insurance became effective.

This leaves Pitt students like
Christa Naples with little hope
of being insured in the near
future. which is when she will
need her coverage most. Christa
has been undergoing treatment
for a chronic problem for years,
paid for by her mother’s health
insurance plan. She was recent-
ly told that the only permanent
solution to her condition is
surgery.

“I’m in pain. but I guess I’ll
put up with it until I can figure
out a way to pay for an opera-

 tion,” said Naples.

Another major health care
provider in Pennsylvania is
Hea1thAmerica. which currently
has no similar program in exis-
tence for college students and

would not comment on whether‘
- it plans to institute one.

Some Pitt students agree there

is no perfect health care system. -

But to them, what they are ask-
ing for seems quite simple

“If I had health care ,it’s not
that I would even use it, unless I

really needed to. I would just be ,

happy knowing that-I could take
care of myself if something
were to happen to me,” Nicholl
said. ' -

stickers for the aluminum can
bins, but that’s as far as they’ll
let us go.”

Aside from the plans for

colored stickers, Brady says;

that the only way for people to
identify most recycling recep-
tacles is by a label pasted
across their fronts. But this
alone doesn’t make the recy-
cling receptacles stand out as
such, and leads to another
problem, contamination.
Contamination occurs when

- non-recyclable materials are

placed with recyclable materi-

als in their receptacles either _

by mistake or on purpose.

The committee meets at 8
p.m. every Wednesday at the
sixth floor lounge of the
William Pitt Union to receive
and discuss new ways of
encouraging effective campus

Pitt's own phantom

Well. it would seem that J. Dennis O’Connor’s specter
continues-to haunt the university, even though he is no
longer chancellor. Seven years ago Pitt was offered $30 mil-
lion to build the long—awaited convocation center, but
O’Connor (in his esteemed wisdom) decided in 1993’ that he
would accept $13 million instead. ' _

No one is really sure what led O’Connor to make this wise
financial decision. Speculation suggests that the decision
was made because the $13 million would be given to Pitt in
one lump sum. while the $30 million would be disbursed

_ over five years. O’Connor must have had a brief period of

lunacy when he took the smaller sum. Either that or he was
just REALLY bad with numbers.

The $17 million difference between what the state original-
ly offered and what O’Connor accepted is still up in the air._
Some think that since O’Connor is no longer a part of Pitt,
his decision shouldn’t stand valid. Unfortunately.

' O’Connor’s decision is legally valid. Just because he is no

longer here doesn’t make everything he ever did void. The
state would be perfectly-justified to stick to its deal with
O’Connor. ~

However, the state would also be cutting off its own foot.
The original goal of grants is to enhance the sta_.te’s image by
enhancing its schools’. A new convocation center for Pitt
would greatly help this university to overcome a lot of its
public image problems. So while the state might bejusttfied,
it wouldn’t be making the correct decision.

A lot of you may be wondering, though, how a convoca-
tion center is going to enhance_Pitt’s public image. It’s just a
fancy word for basketball court, right? Yeah, that’s true.
BUT, a university is about a lot more than just classes. And
one of the foundations of a nationally known school is a
good athletic program.

Pitt’s new convocation center will spark a chain reaction
which will eventually improve the school’s overall image. A
lot of perspective‘ freshmen look at a school’s athletic pro-
gram as a major part of their choice. If a school doesn’t have
a good basketball or football team, a lot of students‘ will
choose another school. The new convocation center will help
the basketball team to get the recruits who had chosen other
schools with better facilities. In turn, the people who want a
school with a national athletic program will find one at Pitt.
Enrollment will increase, and Pitt athletics will regain the
national stature and respect it used to have once upon a time.

One more benefit of the convocation center is that the uni-
versity will finally be able to hold its graduation ceremony

-on campus, where it rightfully belongs.» No more sweltering

afternoons in the Civic Arena, assuming the Penguins aren’t
in the Stanley Cup finals, in which case the ceremony might

~ be pre-empted by a game.

4 The state should definitely reconsider its original offer to
Pitt to build the convocation center. If it is truly concerned
with improving the state schools’ image, this is an excellent
way to start. And maybe there would be a few dollars left
over to hire an exorcist to get rid of O’Connor’s phantom.

Whatis racism,anyWay?

bout
At 5

years
ago, soon
-after I joined
a white cam-
pus Christian
fellowship
where I knew
a number of
people, a staff
m e m b e r

 

ma2‘—
N owlin

approached me about possibly I

being involved in its black “sis—
ter” group. I was having a mild
flirtation with a field hockey
player, and that had something
to do with ‘her concern.

This woman never called me

_ a dirty name or called me inferi-
or, and from what I could tell,
she was trying to encourage and
uplift me. However, she still
thought of me as fundamentally
different than her and didn’t
think I should be in that particu-
lar group, much less have a

‘relationship with that particular

' girl, just because I was black.

And that is racism.

I define racism as a social
addiction which places people
in strict categories according to
race -— a psychic separation, if
you will. Its message is, “I can
tell what you’re like, how you
think, what you can and cannot
do just by looking at you” with-
out regard to experiences,
upbringing or attitudes.
Contrary to popular opinion,
racism has nothing to do with
feelings toward a certain race -
racism, in its purest form, is

exclusively a perception prob- I

lem based on ignorance and
buttressed by fear.

Now, this may not be what
you’ve heard. Most minorities
think of racism as some sort of
impersonal system designed to
lock them out of social and eco-
nomic opportunities taken for
granted by the “dominant racial
group.” As a black man, I am
well aware of slavery, Jim Crow
laws and the like. However,
such injustices are only the
results of racism, as you must

make a distinction between
what racism is and what it does.

However, because racism has
been misdefined, the strategies
to defeat it have so far failed.
Civil rights leaders these days
generally employ a “leftist” cri-
tique, in which racism is
deigned a “structural” or an
“institutional” problem. Their
thinking is that, for example.
blacks’ biggest problem is their
inability to surmount certain
barriers placed upon them by
the “white power structure” that
keep them in an inferior state.
Change the fundamental struc-
ture so that it benefits minorities
and give us more economic and
political power and social sta-
tus, they argue, and racism will
disappear.

But in fact. institutional
racism doesn’t really exist. If a
black _can’t get a bank loan, it’s
not that the bank is racist — it’s
the people who work for the
bank who are. When laws were
passed restricting minority
access to the voting booth. the
blame for that should go to the
people who passed those laws.
not the “system” itself. Same
for housing or job discrimina-
tion - one must never underesti-
mate the human factor.

Besides, even if people got
“equality,” not much will
change. Years ago, I read a
story about a black airline pilot
who wasapproached by an
elderly white woman to help
carry her bags — she mistook
him for a skycap. I also heard
about a young white man who
worked at a law firm who
angrily demanded to know why
a well-dressed black man was
in the building so early in the
morning, not knowing that the
black man was a senior partner.

Nor do I believe that promot-
ing “cultural diversity” really
deals with racism. Now, diversi-
ty in and of itself isn’t a bad
thing, but done wrong (as it
often is), it almost always leads
to misunderstanding and actual-
ly makes the situation worse.

\

For example. whites aren’t as
unified as far as racial concerns
 blacks tend to be. but many
blacks don’t know that because
they’re taught otherwise. A fel-
low black student asked me a
number of years ago. “How do
you know that white students
aren’t talking about you behind
your back?” Frankly. I’m not
that big a threat to white society
that it has to talk about me so
much.

No, the only effective, perma- 

nent way to deal with racism is
to establish committed one—on-
one relationships between peo-
ple of different races. That’s not
easy to do given cultural
chasms, but since we have
already established the bases of
racism as fear and ignorance.
knowledge can bridge them.
During an interview on NBC.
basketball player Glenn “Doc”
Rivers, a black man married to
a white woman, shared the dif-
ferences he and his wife had to
consider at the beginning of
their relationship. I also
heard a story about two men.
one black, the other white, who
played golf at the latter’s pri-
vate club. The white man made
an insensitive remark, and the
black man was ready to call
him a racist — but then he
thought, “If he really hated me,
why did he invite me to play
golf at his private club?” And I
truly believe that if every black
student on this campus were to
build relationships with three to
five whites, racism would be
gone in a couple of years.

I told that fellowship staff
person that her request insulted
me. and to her credit, she never
brought it up again. In doing so.
we established some under-
standing. That’s what has to
happen in order to end racism.

And as I said at the end of a
previous column on the subject.
“There is simply no other way.”

Volleyball splits, loses first Big East match

By Matt Grove
Staff Writer

The Pitt Lady Panthers volleyball team came into last week-
end’s Big East play with a 3-0 conference record looking to stay
perfect at 5-0, but split a pair of away games against conference
foes West Virginia and N otre Dame.

The Lady Panthers -traveled to West Virginia Friday to face the
Lady Mountaineers and came away with a four-game win. Pitt
dropped the first game to the Lady Mountaineers 12-15, but then
came back to take the next three 15-5, 15-8 and 15-11.

Bucknell bombs tennis

By Geoff Moak
Staff Writer '

Numbers can lie. The Pitt
Lady Panthers tennis team
found that out this weekend
at Bucknell. The team lost 7-
0, but many of the individual
matches were close.

“We were competitive.
There were some-close
scores, and a lot of the
matches were closer than the
scores indicated,” coach
George Dieffenbach said.

The day started with two

fairly close doubles matches. ‘

The No. 1 team of Erin
Shalbrack and Marla
Zielinski lost 8-4, and the No.

.2 tandem of Alison Baker and

Kristen Siegel were defeated
8-5.

The first, and only, win of
the day for the Lady Panthers
came from the No. 3 doubles

' team of Jen Bible and Tamara

Kalesnik, who won 8-3. The
perfect example ofhow the
match was closer than the
score made it seem, Bible and

Kalesnik didn’t score any '

points for the team, but they
still played well.
“The Bible-Kalesnik match

was a very good one,”
Dieffenbach said. “They
didn’t score, but they played
good tennis. That’s the way it
is sometimes.”

It was no secret that win-
ning the singles matches
would be difficult for Pitt.
No. 1 singles player Fran
Davis was attending her
brother’s wedding and didn’t
play. _

“alt hurts not having your
top player, because then
every position is one spot
weaker,” Dieffenbach said.

Still, many of the matches
were competitive. Shalbrack
lost her match 7-6, 6-2.

“That first set could have
gone either way,”
Dieffenbach said.

Other players also had
close matches. Zielinski was
defeated 6-4, 7-5. Bible lost
6-3, 6-4, and Kalesnik lost 6-
4,’ 6-3.

Due to rain, the match was
played indoors on a very fast,
hard, rubber surface.

“That surface was as fast as
our surface here is slow. They
were‘ used to it,” Dieffenbach
said. “They came in with a
real good idea of how to play

“The win at West Virginia was really uninspired. We weren’t
really up for the match,” coach Cindy Alvear said. “Pitt has never
lost to WVU, and it’s hard to get up for every match in a 28- to
30-match season.”

Pitt was led by redshirt junior Jennie Driscoll, In the match
Driscoll tallied 16 kills, only three errors and had a .361 hitting
percentage. Freshman Anne Marie Tarara chipped in with 15 kills
and hit .238 on the night, while senior Sara Mikla added 13 kills
and a team-high .417 hitting percentage. _

“I was happy with the way everyone played; we just did what
we had to do to win and not much else,” Alvear said.

West Virginia’s Kyle Palmer notched a game-high 19 kills.
while Sarah Evers and Sandy Shumate added 11 and 10 kills
respectively. As a team. the Lady Mountaineers only hit .110 and
had 32 errors.

Pitt upped its record to 11-7, 4-0 in the Big East, with the win.

Following the win over West Virginia. the Lady Panthers trav-
eled to South Bend, 1nd,, -to face the No. 12 team in the nation, the
Lady Irish of Notre Dame. Pitt put up a fight but fell to Notre
Dame in four games 13-15, 9-15, 16-14 and 8-15.

“The match Friday night at West Virginia had no bearing on the
trip to Notre Dame. I knew that all the kids were coming into this
matchup working hard,” Alvear said.

Driscoll and Sara Mikla led the Lady Panthers with 17 kills
apiece. Driscoll had a team-high .325 hitting percentage in the
loss. Tarara helped the cause with nine kills while senior'Sarah
Mitchell added seven. ‘

Notre Dame had five players with double-figure kills on the
afternoon. Jamie Lee had a game-high 19 for the Lady Irish. The
others were Jenny Birkner (14), Jennifer Rouse (12), Lindsay
Treadwell(1 1) and Kristina Ervin (10).

“We played our best match of the season against them. From the
looks of their team. I know there aren’t' many teams in the Big
East that can beat them,” Alvear said. “But I do feel that with the
way we can play, that we’re in a position to pick them off. I can
tell that our girls feel that [Notre Dame] can be beaten down the
line.”

Alvear also added. “Notre Dame went on a road trip the week

before last and lost some tough games on the road, so the No. 12

ranking will definitely drop.”

Pitt fell to 11-8 overall with the loss and 4-1 in the conference.
Notre Dame upped its record to 18-5 overall and remained perfect
in Big East play at 5-0. '

The Lady Panthers look to get back to their winning ways next
weekend as they travel to St. John’s and Connecticut for another
pair of conference matches. Pitt will face the the Lady Red Storm
Saturday at 2 p.m. and then visit Storrs, Conn., Sunday at noon to
tangle with the Lady Huskies. 

team, 7-0

on a fast surface. They played
defensive tennis and didn’t
make many errors.”

Dieffenbach took nothing
away from the Bucknell play-
ers.

“You have to give the
Bucknell women credit,”
Dieffenbach said. “They
played smart, consistent ten-
nis. Neither team had the ~
tools toiattack, but they con-
sistently got balls back.”

It all added up to a “learn-
ing experience” for the Lady’
Panthers.

“It’s a learning experience-
when you play on any new
surface,” Dieffenbach said.

The seemingly lopsided
scores did not overshadow
the accomplishments of the
team so far this season.

“It’s been a good fall,”
Dieffenbach said. “We have a
6-2 record. Everybody has
worked hard and improved.”

son will continue in two

Penn State

In its final game of the

fall season, the men’s
lacrosse team routed Penn
State 11-6.
A “The game was not as
close as the score shows.”
said head coach Gary Neff.
“We were up 8-1 late in the
third quarter before they
scored their second goal.
They scored five garbage
goals in the fourth quarter.
’ but by then the game was
already over. It was a domi-
nant performance by us.”

Pitt’s defense shut down
Penn State in the first half.

down. We shut them out in
the first half, besides a cheap
goal that was allowed as a
result of a mistake.” said
Neff. “Our goalie. John
McGrath, played very well
and so did the defense in front
of him‘ by not allowing Penn
State to have many scoring
opportunities. I’ve been
impressed by the defense all
season.” -

In the second half, goals by
Shea. Heaps and Love pushed
the lead to 9-3. Penn State
scored to make it 9-4, and
then defenseman Mike
Dombroski tallied with a

coast—to—coast goal. making it

10-4. After giving up two late
goals, Pitt midfielder Bret

" Meyer ended the scoring with

a one—handed goal to make
the final ll-6.

“The goalby Dave was a
great effort on his part,” said

-Neff. “It was great to end the

game with an exciting and
skillful goal by Bret. We
played well today, and it was
good because all 21 of the
guys who dressed played, and
that is what I wanted from
this game.”

Pitt ended its fall season
with a 4-5 record.

“The fall season helped us
out a lot. I’m really not wor-
ried about the wins and loss-
es. The fall is a time to get the
young guys some needed
experience and to prepare for
the games that count in the
spring,” said Neff. “We’ll be
adding a lot of players for the
fall, so we have not put our
best team on the field yet.
because not everyone is able
to play in the fall.

“We are going to be taking
on some varsity teams this
year. and it is good to know
that we will only get better
with the addition of more
players. The outlook is good
for the upcoming fall, and I’m
excited to see how well we do
this year.” I

Last year Pitt finished third
in its division of the National
Collegiate Lacrosse League.
It will start league play at the
end of January.
