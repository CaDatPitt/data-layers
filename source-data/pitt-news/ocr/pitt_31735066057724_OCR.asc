Mayor Murphy holds Oakland town meeting

By Erica Glasspool
For The Pitt News

Prior to Pitt’s next round of expan-
sions, the university must deal with
existing problems before it creates new
ones, said representatives of the Oakland
Agreement at last night’s neighborhood
meeting with Mayor Tom Murphy.

Pitt,'along with a group of 10 neigh-
borhood organizations, known as the
Oakland Agreement, is in the process of
negotiating solutions for such problems
as illegal fraternities, block leasing,
commercial decay and traffic conges-
tion.

“We need to have a frank discussion
on the strengths and weaknesses [of
Oakland] and then figure out how to
build on those strengths,” said Murphy.

Oakland was the site of the 86th
neighborhood meeting in a series of 88,
at which Mayor Murphy gives any resi-
dent of that community the chance to
stand up and state his or her problems,
concerns or opinions. ,

“Pittsburgh has lost half of its popula-
tion since I was born. We have one of
the highest population losses in the
country. Two key things will bring peo-
ple back and make them stay: consis-
tently give high quality of services and

jobs,” said Murphy.

“This meeting is the first step to build-
ing a partnership between the residents
and community officials to figure out
where we want to be in five or 10 years
in the community of Oakland.”

Residents discussed issues pertaining
mostly to traffic congestion, parking and
transportation systems.

Residents also expressed opposition to
the building of the Mon-Fayette
Expressway, a highway connecting I-70
in West Virginia to route 51 in
Pittsburgh, claiming it would bring
added congestion to Oakland by produc-

Local candidate says legalize HEMP

By LeeAnne Mitchell
For The Pitt News

“I’ve always wanted to fix things, and I
believe that what’s going on with the prohibi-
tion of hemp is just plain bullshit,” said State
Senate candidate Gene Baynes to the

University’s HEMP Club last night.

The central platform in Baynes’ Libertarian
campaign is the legalization and decriminal-
ization of marijuana. Citing statistics that 60
percent of people in jails are there for non-
victimizing drug charges, he said the jails are

being filled for no reason.

“The only bad side effect that I see from

smoking weed is that it makes people take
an ‘Oh well, it’s not my problem’ attitude.
Taking that attitude, we’ll never stand up
for ourselves and change the system,” he

said.

Baynes said the real drug war is not a war

war on drugs is completely useless and

Student group reaches out with community service

By Erica Glasspool
For The Pitt News

Many students on campus
have never heard of the Circle K
club, even though it exists in
eight different countries and is
10,000 members strong partici-
pating on four different levels.

“Community service, leader-
ship and friendship — every-
thing our club does relates to
these three things. We develop

leadership and fellowship skills
through community service
while giving something back to
the community,” said Jason
Shea, president of Circle K.

Circle K is a college-based
community service organization
that does anything from helping
raise money for literacy aware-
ness to participating in the
Resident Student Association’s
haunted house.

The club has weekly commu-

nity service projects as well as
bigger, monthly ones. Some of
this years projects deal with The
American Diabetes Association,
Habitat for Humanity and
Family House.

' “One thing I want to stress is _

that this is your club. [The offi-
cers] arrange whatever projects
you want to do. It’s a members’
club,” said Shea

The Circle K club is only one
part in a whole community ser-

vice organization. It is only in its
second year at Pitt but has exist-
ed internationally for years.

The club exists in an hierar-
chy from internationally (eight
different countries), to districts
(basically by states), divisions
(sections within the state) and
down to the individual clubs.

The “K” in Circle K derived
from Kiwanis, which is the
equivalent community service

TOKYO — An earthquake
measuring 8.2 on the Richter
scale rocked Japan’s main
northern island on Tuesday and
sent a tidal wave into a port city.

The quake struck the
Hokkaido island at 10:23 p.m.,
the Meteorological Agency
reported. Tremors could be felt
strongly as far away as Tokyo
and beyond.

The first tidal wave to hit was
in the northern city of Nemuro.
It was only about six feet high,
but authorities said bigger
waves were likely.— Reuters

LOS ANGELES — The judge
in the O.J. Simpson case for-
mally proposed getting rid of
the television camera that has
held the world entranced with
live coverage of the football leg-
end’s trial on double murder
charges.

Superior Court Judge Lance
lto said he would hold a hearing
Nov. 7 at which lawyers for the
media could object to his pro-
posed action.

The judge has repeatedly bit-
terly criticized the way some
news organizations have been
covering the case, accusing
them of “inaccurate” and “slop—
py” reporting. —- Reuters

NEW YORK — Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani canceled the
city’s contract with Legal Aid
lawyers, hours after the lawyers’
union voted to continue its
strike in a wage—and—benefits
dispute. The lawyers represent
300,000 indigent clients a year.

The union’s 1,000 lawyers
walked off the job Saturday,

WASHINGTON —— Farm
groups were quick to lament the
resignation of Agriculture
Secretary Mike Espy, but they
were equally as quick to specu-
late on who might replace him.

Citing pressure from constant
allegations of ethical impropri-
eties, Espy said he will leave
office Dec. 31, telling a packed
press conference he “hoped the
media will give as much ink to
my exoneration as they have to
the accusations.”

Espy has been under fire since
February for accepting illegal
gifts and plane tickets, taking
overly frequent trips to his home
state of Mississippi at taxpayer
expense and appearing to
express favoritism toward meat

tion. — Reuters

Clinton welcomed President

Nelson Mandela of South
Africa to the White House
Tuesday, saluting his “stunning
achievement” in transforming
his country from a system of
apartheid to a multi—racial

Mandela thanked the United
States for its support in over-
coming apartheid and bringing
South Africa under black major-

PITTSBURGH — A fresh-
man at Carnegie Mellon
University, Joseph Gordon, died
Friday in Montefrore University
Hospital of bacterial meningitis.

At first, Gordon’s four room-
mates thought that he was just
having a bad nightmare when
they were awakened late
Thursday night. But they quick-
ly called the police when it
became evident that Gordon, 17,
was having convulsions.

Anita Barkin, director of stu-
dent health services, said 214
doses of Rifampin, a meningitis
antidote, had been distributed to
people who might have come in
contact with Gordon.—-

There are too many mis-
conceptions about sexual
exploitation in our society.
The only purpose they
serve is to perpetuate a
“blame the victim” attitude,
and unfortunately to make
it much more difficult for
rape victims to come for-
ward, seek help and, ulti-
mately, recover from the
assault. In addition, mis-
conceptions or myths about
date/acquaintance rape may
s u b t 1 y
encourage
more rapes
to occur.

In an
attempt to
diffuse these
misconcep-
tions or
myths about
date/acquaintance rape, I
will expose one each month
to the university communi-
ty via a “Myth of the
Month” series in The Pitt
News. My purpose is to
continue to work toward
reducing the incidence of
sexual assault on the Pitt
campus and to encourage
victims to report their
assaults rather than live in
fear for the remainder of
their lives.

 

OCTOBER MYTH OF
THE ' MONTH:
“Date/Acquaintance Rape
Does Not Happen on the
Pitt Campus.”

A nationwide survey con-
ducted a while ago by Ms.
magazine psychologist
Mary P. Koss and the
National Institute for

Mental Health revealed
many startling and disturb-
ing facts:

°25 percent
of women
in college
have been
the victims
of rape or
attempted
rape.
-84 percent
of these
victims were acquainted
with their assailants.
°Only 27 percent of women
raped identified themselves
as rape victims. T
°One in every 12 men
admits to committing acts
that meet legal definitions
of rape.

Recent national statistics

have revealed that, among

women between the ages of

17 and 23, one out of every

150 women reports a rape.

organization for members of the
business world.

Kiwanis sponsors Circle K as
well as their high school equiva-
lent Key Club, and the junior
high club, Builders.

“We are not all work and no
play,” said Shea. Along with
weekly volunteer projects,
Circle K also holds social events
such as a murder—mystery party,
dances and even a weekend
retreat called Interpack to Camp
Blue Diamond near Penn State
University.

Interpack is a district event
which includes Pennsylvania’s
six different regions: Erie

(Northwest), Allegheny
(Southwest), Capitol
(Southcentral), Center
(Northcentral), Anthracite
(Northeast) and Eastern

(Southeast).

Colleges attending from the
Allegheny division include
members from Pitt’s main cam-
pus in Oakland,’ Pitt—
Johnstown, Pitt— Greensburg,
Indiana University of
Pennsylvania and Duquesne

University.

“I like doing volunteer work. I
was in Walk America, but I
come from a small town and I
never had the chance to do stuff
like this,” said freshman Shayna
Kasbee.

Each year there is an intema-
tionally set theme and each dis-
trict has it’s own set sub-theme.
This year the international
theme is literacy and
Pennsylvania’s district theme is
children.

The six different committees,
each with it’s own chair, that
reside within Circle K are;
Service Initiative, Projects, K-
Family, Public Relations, Social
and Membership Development
and Education.

“I don’t deserve all the cred-
it,” said Shea. “It’s the people
who chair the committees that
do the work.”

The club meets every
Wednesday night at 8:30 in the
Cathedral of Learning, Room
G—l3. At every other meeting a
professional related to that
week’s project will be a guest
speaker on relevant topics.

ing more thru traffic.

If the highway was built all
the way up to the parkway,
added traffic could be avoid-
ed.

“Then there is a problem
of figuring out where and
how to build all of the con-
nections [on and off ramps]
to the surrounding communi-
ties,” said Patrick Hassett,
principle transit planner for
Pittsburgh.

The Spine Line, an exten-
sion of the subway from
Downtown to Oakland,
would decrease traffic in
Oakland and was supported
by most residents.

One of Murphy’s sugges-
tions for relieving congestion
was to obtain an aban-
doned railroad and turn it
into a bikeway between
Downtown and Oakland.

Concerning parking, one
resident pointed out that
1700 permits and 1400 visi-
tor passes were issued for
parking in area D. The prob-
lem, he stated, is that there is

only room to issue 1200.
That leaves an overflow of
3500.

“I don’t understand why
the non-parking areas in

South Oakland aren’t
marked, but then they ticket
you,” said Jeannette

Johnson, a graduate student
at the School of Engineering
at Pitt.

She also pointed out that
an abandoned police station
on Louisa Street still had a
sign up that said, “No
Parking.”

“To me that seems outdat-
ed,” she said.

Many disabled and elderly
people focused on the lack of
enforcement of prohibiting
skateboarders, bikers and
roller-skates on the side-
walks.

In rebuttal to complaints

about loitering, Murphy said
it’s unconstitutional to force
people to leave and that the
city could be sued, but he’s
hoping that placing a curfew
law on teenagers will help
the problem.

HEMP

°From page 1
our wonderful system that means that
they have to be harassed and thrown in
jail so that the system can turn it around
and make all of the money prosecuting
them,” he said.

Baynes said he can’t understand how ,

marijuana can be illegal while the gov-
ernment continues to subsidize the
tobacco industry.

“We’ve yet» to record the first death
from smoking weed, and yet last year
465,000 people died of cancer from

smoking cigarettes. Where’s the justice
in that scenario? The powers that be
know that this is a crock, but they will
get away with what we let them,” he
said.

Baynes encouraged the students
involved in the HEMP Club to
become more vocal and active, recall-
ing that in the 60’s students banded
together and actually changed the sys-
tem.

Baynes is running against Senate
Majority Whip Len Bodack, who

he said “is so powerful that no
Republican even runs against him.”

He said he needs all of the support he
can get, saying that the more votes
that he pulls now, the more attention
will be placed on the legalization issue.

Whether he wins or loses, Baynes
said he will not be bitter.

“Maybe I can’t win the race with a
platform of legalizing hemp, but at least
I stood on the principles of what I
believed in. I will not allow the system
to conquer me.”

Wood said, is to “acclimate
[the students] to the envi-
ronment and get them inde-
pendent”

The office maintains close
relationships with the stu-
dents. Some may stay at the
university for as long as
seven years.

Bringing foreign faculty
to Pitt is also one of the
responsibilities of interna-
tional services.

Wood said he understands
there can be a problem with
a -language barrier between
teaching assistants and pro-
fessors and the students.

His advice to students
who are experiencing this is

“first give it time, focus
on what the TA or profes-
sor is saying, and think
in the context of the materi-
al.” '

“Remember that the peo-
ple who come here are also
dealing with an accent,”
added Wood.

“Students should feel free
to ask their [instructors] to
repeat what they said.”

Language barrier aside,
Wood said having foreign
teaching assistants and
professors can and should
be an enriching experience.

“You may be in the posi-

tion to see subject matter or
whatever you’re dealing
with in the class from two
or three different perspec-
tives.”
1 When asked what changes
he would like to see in
regards to the international
picture, Wood said he would
like to see an increase in the
number or undergraduate
foreign students.

merely because of sexual orien-
tation would certainly seem to
constitute discrimination,”
Haley said. “This commitment
to equal treatment is far more
important than any news value
this event might have had.”

He said allegations that the
decision is censorship are
wrong, since the action was
based on the newspaper’s long-
standing policy to avoid report-
ing on private events such as
weddings.

“Some individuals both on
and off campus have chosen to
describe this decision as censor-
ship. A look at the facts
involved does not support that
claim,” Haley said. “Rather, it

. shows that it was an administra-

tive judgment that was solidly
based on the university’s long-
standing policy and practice in
regard to events in Heinz
Chapel.”

Haley said the Times has
never reported on a private
Heinz Chapel event in its 25-
year history. He said even the
highly-attended funeral for
Senator John Heinz in 1991 and
last month’s memorial service
for victims of the USAir Flight
427 accident were not covered
in the newspaper.

“Except for special events
sponsored by the university, all
of the other [events] are private,
and they do not affect anyone in
the university in their official
university-related capacity,”
Haley said. “Thus, they have no
news value which is consistent
with the University Times’ prin-
cipal reporting functions.”

Choosing to run the article
would have violated Pitt’s poli-
cy on non-discrimination,
which bans discrimination of
any kind based on race, gender,
religion, age and sexual orienta-
tion, Haley said.

“If we were to have reported
on this particular ceremony, the
only reason for do.ing so
would_’ve been because the par-
ticipants were gay,” Haley said.
“In other words, we would’ve
violated the university’s long-
standing policy and the individ-
uals’ right to privacy because of
their sexual orientation.”

“The real news we should
communicate is that this
university takes non-discrimi-
nation and the privacy of
relationships seriously and that
we will continue to do so,” he
said.

The assembly also voted to
continue supporting the Times
as an independent agency which
communicates university news
to faculty and staff.

In other Faculty Assembly
business, the Faculty Assembly
president, James Holland,
discussed the results of the
University Senate’s recent
opinion survey of Pitt’s
School of Dental Medicine
Dean Jon B. Suzuki.

The survey, which was mod-
eled after a survey used to eval-
uate University of Pittsburgh-
Bradford’s president, Richard
McDowell, was returned by 84
part-time and full—time dental

faculty.

The 28-question survey yield-
ed a generally low approval rat-
ing of Suzuki, who has over-
seen the dental school’s acade-
mic operations since l990. In
12 of the 28 categories, more
than 50 percent of the survey
participants “definitely or gen-
erally disagreed” with the cate-
gories’ positive statements
about Suzuki.

Among the statements in the
survey which participants were
asked to agree or disagree with
were: Suzuki “communicates
clearly to the faculty the expec-
tations he has for the school;”
he “considers faculty opinion
in arriving at administrative
decisions” and he “consults
with the faculty on important
matters in a timely and effective
fashion.”

Holland said that although 84
survey forms were returned
from the "179 that were mailed,
the survey could still prove
effective. “When you do sur-
veys and get a return of about
50 percent, you consider it pret-
ty good.”

The survey was organized to
replace an anonymous dental
opinion faculty survey which
was circulated in November
1993. The earlier survey had
been criticized by some since
there was no way to prove that
dental faculty had actually taken
part in it.

The current survey was moni-
tored by Pitt administrators and
University Senate members and
was counted by the clerk of the
University Senate.

In other activities, Senate
Committee on Anti-
Discriminatory Policies mem-
ber Professor Barbara Shore
updated the assembly on Pitt
faculty’s compliance with the
federal Americans with
Disabilities Act (ADA).

The ADA, instituted in 1992,
defines the services which must
be made available to disabled
persons by all schools receiving
federal funding.

“The effect of our policy is
hopefully to let students know
what they’re entitled to under
the [ADA] and also to educate
faculty as to what they’re oblig-
ated to do  and to give them
help in doing it.” _

Shore said Pitt is recognized
nationally for its compliance
with the act and the services it
provides for students with dis-
abilities.

“The number of disabled stu-
dents on this campus has shot
way up, and we are known
across the country as one of the
best and most supportive places
for disabled students to come,”
Shore said. “I think that should
be a badge of pride.”

Myth

-From page 2

A lack of reporting does not
mean that a problem does not
exist. Under—reporting is a
serious issue on every campus
throughout the United States.

If you believe that rape

does not happen on the Pitt '

campus, you are contributing
to the isolation of the victims
(10 percent of the victims are
males) and to the prevalence
of the myths which abound in
relation to sexual exploita-
tion. In addition, you are
encouraging rather than pre-
venting sexual assault from
occurring on the Pitt campus.
Date/acquaintance rape does
happen here.

tor of Pitt’s Sexual Assault
Services oﬁice.)

Opinions

Supreme Court in session

The youngest Supreme Court in over 50 years, and the sec-
ond youngest this century, opened its courtroom for business
on Monday. The average age of the court members is 6.0.
This is a significant drop from the average age in the 70’s,
before the recent slew of appointees, five in the last six years.
Presidents Nixon, Reagan and Bush tried, with only partial
success, to form the Supreme Court around their conservative
mold. President Clinton has countered in the last two years
with the appointments of two moderate liberals, Ruth Bader
Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer. How the new composition will
affect the Supreme Court remains to be seen.

There are a number of important cases before the Supreme
Court this year. One is term limits. Arkansas amended its
state constitution to impose term limits on members of
Congress. The justices must decide whether the constitution
prohibits states from setting qualifications for election to
Congress beyond the age, citizenship and residency require-
ments specified in Article 1. The Arkansas Supreme Court
declared term limits unconstitutional, and it is this ruling
which is now on appeal. This decision will have far—reaching
ramifications, and there is no consensus on how the court
will rule.

Another controversial segment of the cases for this year
involves affirmative action. In one case, a white contractor
challenges a federal program which gives minority bidders a
slight cost advantage in bidding for Transportation
Department business.

In another case, Missouri claims to have fulfilled its obliga-
tion to desegregate Kansas City public schools. Common to
both cases is the question of whether or not the time for affir-
mative action has passed, as some justices have argued.
Others, however, like retired justice Harry Blackmun, con-
tend that race and past discrimination must still be taken into
account because of the racial injustice which still exists in
our society.

The Supreme Court will also rule on the death penalty. In
question is what standard should be used in permitting
state death row inmates to come to Federal Court with
delayed claims of innocence. The specific case deals with
Missouri inmate Lloyd E. Schulp who was sentenced to
death for murdering a fellow inmate. Years later, however,
new witnesses were found who testified to Schulp’s inno-
cence, and a surveillance videotape was discovered to sup-
port his alibi. .

The Supreme Court has cut down on the number of cases it
reviews in recent years; however, those it has chosen will set
the stage for important judgments. The question is whether
the Court will reach a new consensus with its new members
or whether it will stay divided. ’

With the new makeup of the court, a general consensus
among its members could reshape the legal structure of the
country.

spectators (either at the stadi-
um or at home) colleges
wouldn’t be able to afford the
athletic programs. These pro-
grams are big business for col-
leges —- a business with con-
tracts for athletic wear, televi-
sion rights and endorsements.

But for those in college,
sports are just fun —— recre-
ation or entertainment. I never
realized how seriously some
schools take their sports until
last weekend. After attending
a college where basketball and
football tickets were free (in
fact, the administration would
practically bribe you to attend
the televised games), I
couldn’t believe what lengths
some students go to for tickets.

The tickets in questionare
not just any tickets. They are
Duke Blue Devil tickets.
Apparently Duke, like many
schools, has an extremely lim-
ited number of student tickets.
Duke undergraduates must
stand in line, even camp out,
before every game to get a stu-
dent ticket. They have no
opportunity to purchase season
tickets.

at any time during the 36
hours.

The check-in involves show-
ing your ID to one of the stu-
dents in charge. Students are
awakened at all hours of the
night for these check-ins.
Students can miss only one
check-in and still be eligible
for the ticket lottery.
Remember, even if you make
every check-in and survive the
36 hours, you only get a spot
in the lottery. Preference is
then given to upperclassmen
among the graduate students
who have camped in tent city
in previous years.

One student appropriately
titled the experience
“Dukestock,” because the rain
starting falling on Duke’s tent
city this year. The rain left
Dukestock a muddy mess,
with students craving a hot
shower.

This leads me to wonder
how far Pitt Panther basketball
fans would go to get tickets.
My undergraduate school
couldn’t fill the student sec-
tions until the team made it to
the National Invitational

for students and alumni. Pitt
will be buzzing with a
Zambelli Internationale fire-
works display and a Centrak
laser show. Some local bands,
including The Clarks, will be
playing in the William Pitt
Union. And last but not least,
you can show your support for
Pitt basketball, without camp-
ing out, by celebrating the first
official day of practice.
Midnight Madness will take
place Friday night at
Fitzgerald Field House. This is
your chance to meet the new
Panther coach, Ralph Willard,
the Panther players and the
Lady Panthers.

Both the Pitt football and
basketball programs have had
their glory days and their not
so glorious days, but they con-
tinuieto provide us with
entertaining and exciting sea-
sons year after year.

So start thinking “slam
dunk” and “free throw,” in
addition to “touchdown,” and
support the Panthers.

Non-
revenue
sports
get no
respect

 
    

C0lulSt I Nesko? The

Keith thing that
Pompey divides

these gentle-
men is exposure.

For the past three years,
Nesko, who is presently
injured like McCullough and
Martin, has been of the one
of the best distance runners
on the East Coast. His
absence from the team
means a lot to the cross-
country runners, for Nesko is
one of the best athletes at
Pitt.

But while McCu1lough’s
and Martin’s injurys were
the headline of every news-
paper in the Pittsburgh area,
no one cared about Nesko’s.

This reminds one of what
has been going on at just
about every university for
years.

Non-revenue sports get the
Rodney Dangerfield effect.
They just simplly get no
respect.

The non—revenue sports at
Pitt deserve to be treated the
same as the football and
men’s basketball teams.

Let the record speak for
itself. Since 1989, Pitt teams
have won 23 conference
championships — not a sin-
gle one from a squad that
brings in the big bucks.

The last time the football
or basketball teams sat on
the top of the hill was the
late 1980s. By the look of so
far this season, it might be a
long time before either team
gets back on top.

But while these team are
faltering, the “non—money”
teams are among the best in
the nation. Last season, the
volleyball, men’s and
women’s diving and
women’s track teams sent
athletes to the NCAA
Championships.

Last year, the women’s
track team broke its own
world record in the shuttle
hurdle relay. Afterwards, the
critics claimed it was only a
hurdle relay team.

Who cares‘? A record is a
record.

It is definitely time for a
change. We need to support
non-revenue teams. Doesn’t

Non-conference collapse...

The disappointment in Pitt
volleyball head coach Cindy
Alvear’s voice said it all as the
Lady Panthers hit one of their
lowest points in recent years
last night.

“We can’t seem to get over
the hump and have everyone
have a good match on the
same night,” Alvear said. “The
servicing broke down and our
defense wasn’t real spectacu-
lar, and individuals just need
to step it up.”

That was what Alvear had to
say last night after the Lady
Panthers (8-6) dropped their
match to the University of
Akron.

The match lasted just over
two hours and saw Pitt lose in
four games.

Pitt opened the match by
taking the first game 15-10.
However, the next three games
and the match belonged to the
Akron Zips as they knocked
Pitt off by the scores of 15-13,
15-10 and 15-10.

After sweeping Boston
College on Saturday, the team
appeared to be out of the
woods.

However, this loss puts them

back at square one, as they

Todd Graf was off to his best season at Pitt before another

ankle injury held him in check.

By Brett F ondrk
Staff Writer

For the past few seasons.
Todd Graf has had difficulty
living up to his reputation 

an accomplished goal scorer.
The former Mt. Lebanon star
and high school All-American
had been slowed by nagging
injuries and never really
reached his full potential.

 

This year, however, Graf
was healthy for the first part of
the season. And before an
ankle injury slowed him, he
proved that he could be the
dangerous scorer that he was
labeled coming out of high
school.

The fiery junior forward had
a fabled scholastic career.

Graf attended high school at
Gateway for three years and
transferred to Mt. Lebanon
where his father was principal
his senior year. That year, he
led the Blue Devils to the
WPIAL and state semifinals
only to be defeated both times
by Upper St. Clair, which iron-
ically was led by current team-
mate Dean Astorino.

“I’m still bitter,” Graf said.
“We lost to them every time,
but I knew we were still bet-

Graf, whose intensity. was a
trademark of his style of play,
was an unstoppable scorer at
Mt. Lebo, where he netted 18
goals his senior year. His
description of his high school
goal scoring prowess is very
simple.

“I’d get the ball, dribble
through everyone and score. It
was pretty easy,” Graf said.

For his efforts, Graf claimed
All-WPIAL, All-State and
Regional All-American honors
and was heavily recruited.

San Diego State, UCLA.
Indiana and South Carolina
were among the interested.
Graf chose Pitt because he
wanted to stay close to home.

Graf, who was know for his;

excellent dribbling skills as
well as scoring prowess, was
the top recruit in the ‘92 fresh-
man class that included team-
mates Jeff Porter, Dean
Astorino and J .L. Gorsin.

He appeared to have the tal-
ent to step in and contribute
immediately but ran into prob-
lems as most freshmen do
when they make the transition
to Division 1 competition.

“He struggled his freshman
year,” assistant coach Chris
Karwoski said. “He wanted to
do things his own way. He was
able to do anything he wanted
at Mt. Lebanon and wasn’t
able to do that here.”

Graf fought off an ankle
injury and appeared in 13
games, recording only two
assists. His playing time
dropped dramatically his
sophomore year as a nagging
ankle injury limited him to
only five games. To say that he
was disappointed would be an
understatement.

“I wanted to redshirt, but I
found out that I had played too

many games,” Graf said of his ’

sophomore year. ‘‘I seriously
thought about transferring.”

“He brought with him his
attitude and reputation,”
Karwoski said. “He wanted to
do things his own way, and
you can’t do that on the
Division 1 level.”

With his long hair and
intense attitude on the field,
Graf had all too often been

Dufresne finds her niche of Pitt

By Adam Pincus
Staff Writer

When people truly enjoy
what they are doing, it is obvi-
ous to everyone. You can see
it in their eyes and hear it in
their voices, and you know
that their hearts are into it.

This is definitely the case
with Stephanie Dufresne, the
latest addition to the Pitt vol-
leyball team via Canada.

Dufresne chose Pitt over
big—name volleyball schools
like Nebraska, Ohio State,
Florida and Hawaii. “Pitt was

97

the second school I visited,

Dufresne said. “The coaches »

were very nice, and I heard
that the program was good.”

Volleyball has been a big
part of her life for many years.
When she was thirteen, her
older sister persuaded her to
try it out, and that is where her
career began. Dufresne fell in
love with the game and started
playing in several local tour-
naments around her home-
town of Quebec.

By the time she was fifteen,
Dufresne had developed into a
talented player. At one of the

tournaments, she was spotted
by Jean—Pierre Chancy, who is
the coach at the University of
Montreal and the local author-

hity on volleyball in the

Montreal/Quebec area. He
invited her to his camp for
“potential” players. From that
point on, she became more
dedicated to volleyball, and it
became a much bigger part of
her life. Dufresne and Chancy
continued to work together
throughout Stephanie’s high
school career. During this
time, Stephanie played for a

provincial team.

The Canadian educational
system is set up differently
than its American counterpart.
Canada’s system includes a
level between high school and
college, which equates to an
American junior college. This
level lasts two years. Then
they start college at about 19
or 20 years old and usually go
until they are about 24 or 25.
The provincial team is where
she met Laurie Fernandez,
who is an outside hitter and
setter for the Lady Panthers.

Dufresne credits Fernandez,
who is from Toronto, as one of
the reasons that she came to
Pitt and was able to feel wel-
come. After two years of high
school, Dufresne followed
Chancy to the University of
Montreal. She played at
University of Montreal for one
year before the school decided
to stop funding the program.

Montreal will most likely
field a team next year, but

Chancy recommended that his
players pursue other options.
Pitt was more than happy to
add Dufresne to its squad.

Dufresne admits that when
she first came to Pittsburgh
she was very nervous about
her new situation.

“The transition is hard. It’s
very hard,” Dufresne said. “In
class it is hard to listen, under-
stand and write English.”

The language barrier also
overlapped into Stephanie’s
volleyball game.

“In the beginning, I had
problems,” Dufresne said. “I
am very talkative, and when I
first came here I did not take

agrees that Dufresne has
adjusted well.

“I think that in light of all
the changes, she has adjusted
phenomenally well,” Alvear
said. “Every kid who comes to
school from a foreign area, be
it a state or whatever, has a lot
to adjust to, but she also is in a
different country, and she is
speaking a different language,
and the culture is different. It
is not like coming from
Minnesota, where you are
away from home but every-
thing else is the same.” ‘

With time Stephanie has
become more and more com-

fortable in her new environ-
ment, and it has become more
evident in both her attitude
and her game.

“Stephanie is very upbeat,”
Alvear said. “She is more ver-
bal and communicates more,
but actually the reason she
didn’t at first I think was
because of the language barri-
er. If we were in a game set-
ting in practice, she wouldn’t
necessarily know the correct
words to use, and so she was
quieter than shewould have
been had she been playing in
French. She has just become
more comfortable. She is a lit-

tle bit more assertive, and she
communicates better with her
hitters. She is definitely set-
tling in.”

Settling in may be an under-
statement, as Stephanie has
quietly compiled some of the
best numbers in the Big East.
As of last night’s game against

Akron, Dufresne was ranked ‘

third in the conference in
assists with an average of 10.5
per game. She is a big part of

the reason why Pitt is tied for

fourth in the Big East with

11.7 assists per game.

Stephanie is also ranked

charge, because I did not
know how to approach the
girls. After the first week, they’
talked to me and told me I had
to take charge. They said to
say anything, even if it was in
French; you just have to talk.
But now I think it is okay,
because I am talking more on
the court.”

fourth in the conference in
serving.

She has compiled 24 aces in
48 games for an average of
0.5 for the season. A
The funny thing about
Dufresne’s success is that she
was not supposed to be a
starter this season, and she
was not expected to play such
a prominent role in the team.

“The decision to have
Stephanie set was forced on
us when Annie Mernagh was
diagnosed with possible stress
fractures,” Alvear said.

“We basically had designed
it so that whoever won the
position would set. However,
we did not have the opportu-
nity, because Annie could not
compete. We did not plan on
anything.

“My philosophy is that you
earn a position; you don’t get
one by default. Unfortunately
this team has a lot of positions
that are won by default,

Graf

and I think you are a better
competitor and a better team
when you earn positions.
It is not by design that
Stephanie is setting, but I
think that she has stepped in
and done a fine job.”

Winning the conference is
the Lady Panthers’ primary
goal, and it is definitely their
goal to lose.

Dufresne said that the
team’s goals are to not only
win the Big East, but also to
win a game or two in the
NCAA tournament.

They are taking one step at
a time, however.

Personally, Dufresne would
like to improve her defensive
game.

“I think I am good, and I am
quick, but in games I have too
many things to think about,”
Dufresne said.

She may have some things
to iron out, but her play so far
this year has been a pleasant
surprise to everyone.

0From page 9 -
labeled as egotistical and
cocky.

“He’s ﬂashy, at the time he
had a pony tail,” Astorino said
of his high school rival. “My
high school hated him, and the
fans and parents hated him.”

But this year has been a
complete change for Graf both
mentally and physically. Gone
is the pony tail, and in is a
menacing crew cut that almost

.is symbolic of Graf’s turn-

around. The on-field intensity
is still the same, but his atti-
tude has made a 180 degree
turn around for the better.

“He has been great,”
Karwoski said. “This year he
has matured 200 percent. He
has grown up and is willing to
play a major role in the team.”

“He’s fitting into the system
much better. Other guys see
that, and we’re successful.”

Graf has clearly become
more of a team player, but he
still is far from a conformist
and has not changed every-
thing. Just take a look at his
feet. His neon blue shoes that
he has worn s-ince high school
are so bright that they almost
glow. At times, his feet look
like blue streaks as he zips
down the sidelines. The blue
Adidas Gazelles will seeming-

ly be with him forever. He also

has elected to live alone off
campus this year after previ-
ously living in dorms.

“It’s great, I wanted to be
more relaxed,” he said.

It also has helped him spend
more time training. He says at
times he spent up to seven
days a week lifting and run-

ning in preparation for this
season.
“His work ethic has never

been a problem,” coach Joe _
Luxbacher said. “He’s very fit,

you can tell that he works very
hard in the off—season.”

And all that hard work has
paid off.

“He is a great player. He’s
more confident in himself this
year,” Karwoski said. “He has
the potential to be phenome-
nal.”

These are mighty nice things
to say about a player who was
very close to leaving the pro-
gram. It’s amazing how things
can change in a years’ time.

The junior forward has start-
ed every game and has teamed
up with Eric Prex and Dean
Astorino to form one of more
formidable forward lines in the
Big East Conference.

And before being injured in
last Tuesday’s 3-2 win over St.
Bonaventure, Graf was the
second—leading scorer on the
team with six points (two
goals, two.assists). _

“I was running down the
sidelines and one of their play-
ers kicked my right ankle from
behind,” he said. “I really
think that he was trying to hurt
me.”

The Panthers ‘won the game,
but may have lost one of their
best players for the season.

“I’m not sure how bad it is
yet,” he said. “[Pitt orthopedic
surgeon] Dr. [Freddie] Fu is
going to check me out and see
if I need surgery or not.”

For Graf, it could be a bitter
end to what was shaping up to
be a big season.

Zielinski said.
The doubles team perfor-
mance salvaged a telling victo-

ry for a Lady Panthers unit that '

lost to Robert Morris 0-9 last

SCEISOII.

After
losing her
singles
match 6-
2, 6-1,
Zielinski
said she
— “didn ’t
want to leave the match with
two losses.”

“We knew we could get
them,” Zielinski said. After
winning the second set, “we
were on a roll.”

losing 7-6, 6-2.

Baker suffered from a severe
sinus infection and fever,
while Keister continues to suf-
fer from an injured wrist.

“If we would have been up
to our best, we would have
won,” Keister said.

“I was trying to cover a lot
of space,” Keister said due to
Bal<er’s sickness.

“I was really run down,”
Baker said after winning her
singles match 7-6, 6-2. Baker,
normally the first-ranked sin-
gles player, was replaced by
Fran Davis due to her illness.

Davis had no problem step-
ping into the position, winning
her match 6-0, 6-3. A

“It made me a little nervous

the key to her win, she said.

The position—switching of
Baker and Davis will not
remain permanent, Davis said.

“I’m happy playing No. 2
singles,” Davis said.
“Wherever is fine.”

Keister won her singles
match 6-3, 4-1. The second set
was retired early due to a
twisted ankle from Robert
Morris’ Heather Tyler.

“She was crying on the
floor,” Keister said after
Keister’s dropshot sent Tyler
twisting to the ground. '

Keister considered the match
her best of the year, as it com-
bined “nice baseline shots and
good angles.”

Sophomore transfer Tamara
Kalesnik chalked up a win for
Pitt, defeating Abbey Hauck 6-

2, 6-1.

“The other girl had a differ-
ent version,” Kalesnik said.

With no officials on hand to
keep track of the score, the
players are responsible for
maintaining their game score.

Hauck complained Kalesnik
kept the wrong score.

“It didn’t matter; it was still
a win,” Kalesnik said.

Maybe the loud grunting
by Hauck threw everyone off.

“I thought I was playing
against Monica Seles,”
Kalesnik said, referring to
Hauck’s continually loud
grunting.

The Lady Panthers have a
week off until their next home
match against Canisius to fig-
ure out scores and patch up
injuries.

it get depressing every time
you go to a Pitt football
game and the Panthers lose?
Can anyone even remember
the last time our basketball
team won?

The Pitt volleyball team
has won six consecutive Big
East crowns, and no one is
ever at the games. It is time
to support them and the rest
of the non-revenue sports.
We should give them more
respect.

As recent history tells,
without them we would
never be able to say, “Pitt is
it.”

can’t seem to get a winning
streak started.

“[Akron] didn’t play that
well. They executed a game
plan against us where they
basically hit a lot of off-speed
shots and threw the ball
around a lot,” Alvear said.
“We were just not able to run
it down and transition it.”

A few Pitt players managed
to put up some solid numbers,
however.

Melanie Gustafson hit the
ball well and registered 14
kills, as did Sarah Mikla.
Stephanie Dufresne continued
to add to her assist totals for
the year, with a total of as of
53 last night. ’

On the defensive side of
things, Annemarie Mernagh
had 17 digs, Sarah Mitchell
had 28 and Jennie Driscoll had
10 to go along with her 2
blocked shots and 3 block
assists. 1

Akron was able to dictate
its style of play to Pitt. The

Zips had five players with
double—digits in kills, includ-
ing Jennifer Borton, who had
18. Akron’s setter, Patti
Godzinski, also had a big
night with 55 assists, 5 service
aces and 10 digs.

Going into the game, Akron
was 15-3, so Pitt knew it
might have its hands full, but
this was not a game the Lady
Panthers thought they would
lose. ,

Akron’s record may have
been more notable than Pitt’s,
but the Lady Panther’s are
used to playing a higher level
of competition in the Big East
as compared to the Mid-
American Conference, of
which Akron is a member.

This is a Pitt team that is
used to success, and so far this
year they have had very little.

The team is now two games
over .500 and 1-0_in the Big
East. In Pitt’s defense, it has
played some very tough teams
so far this season, and that can
only make it a better team.
