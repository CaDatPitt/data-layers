New Parking Lot Opens

Part of Pitt’s parking problem
was relieved Monday when a new
parking lot between Tennyson
and Ruskin Aves. was opened for
the use of -140 faculty members
and administration personnel. \

The lot has a clever gate device
so that it can be operated on a
24-hour "self-service basis. Each
user has been given a key which
he may insert into a slot which
controls the gate by reaching out
from his. seat. For cars leaving
the lot, a magnet device has been

to rise automatically.

The lot has not been used for
parking since construction began
on adjacent Clapp Hall last June.
Prior to that time the entire block
provided parking facilities.

This is the ﬁrst and largest of
several lots _the University hopes
to develop within the next few
years. A 350-car garage in the
area in front of the Presbyterian
Hospital is also in the process of
development.

ti”Ford Curtis Reviews Tempo Of Broadway

Professor Finds ,
Miller Superior
As Playwright.

By IRV ROTHMAN

 .The two leading American
 playwrights of the ' past de-
  c ad e , Tennessee Williams
v_.;; _ (Streetcar Named Desire) and
 Arthur, Miller (Death of a
 Salesman}, s h o u l d provide
 ny more years of rivalry in
the theatre, drama critic Ford
Curtis predicts. , .
P But, Curtis ventures, “Though
« this season the honors are to Wil-
“ f ’ liams, I think‘ Miller will emerge

V  -the greater dramatist.” A
 Dr. Curtis, professor of English,
reached his decision after a whirl-
wind tour of Broadway theaters
during the semester’ break where
he saw, among other shows, Wil-
liams’ “Cat orrthe Hot Tin Roof”
 and Miller’s “A View From the
 _, .Bridge.”

 

 

 

Play Tells Story
V ‘Miller’ writes of self-respect,
hope, security, but he permits the
 -audience to realize these aspects
__ of human bein-gs through the peo-
’ _  ple and the situation depic_ted on
~, the... stage: the play tells its own
"if-_—~*§tory. On the other hand, Williams
' L is “often cloudy,_” although that
. ‘-j‘. writer claims life to be as vague.
‘ ' Curtis found “Cat” harsh, vul-
-;;: gar, and realistic, worthy of both
j. ;_ - the Pulitzer and Drama Critics’.
' n .which it received last year. .
,  The professor differed with
V practically every major New York
critic when he found the ﬁrst one
 show in Miller's combination
-of two‘ one act plays—“A View
._  From the Briclge”-—the equ_al pf
  theother, ifnot better. , ‘
7‘ ' Clear, Vivid People Shown
_ The ﬁrst, .‘.‘lVIemory of ‘ Two
A .Monday~s,” depicted clear and
I‘ ‘ ‘vivid people after. the depression,
who are remembered even though
the audience sees them for a short
‘ :time. The second, one-act produc-
 tion, the “View _. . .”,had’ a “story
i  60‘, simple, the plot- too evident
_:so that tension that must be true
of tragedy ‘is missing.”
‘Dr. Ford Curtis, whose’ thea-
tre going is business as well as
' -pleasure, considers himself, dur-
ing the annual .2 trips, “a play-
»goer on a playgoing spree.” 'He

Reports Successful Season

Reporting on an uriusually suc-
cessful season, the professor agreed
with critics on most shows, came
up with surprises on others." He
ran the gamut of musical comedy,
comedy, and serious plays.

Reviewer Praises
Pantomime Whiz
From Continent

“Pipe Dream,” the musical
comedy by Rodgers and Ham-
merstein, based on Steinbeck’s ‘
“Sweet Thursday,” was consid-

ered luke-warm by critics and
Curtis. With typical tongue in
cheek, the professor referred to
the writing team in explaining
the critique, “If you’re looking
for a home-run everytime Wil-
lie Mays comes to hat, you are
disappointed when he doubles.”

In comedy, the husband—wife
team of Lynn Fontainne and Al-
fred Lunt who “form one of the
great acting teams of theatre his-
tory, andcertainly the greatest of
our time” are disappointing in the
cloak-and-dagger -. p i e c e , “The
Great Sebastian”; “It doesr_’t give
[them] enough chance to show
their range as actors.”

Dr. Curtis feels that Broadway,
this year, oﬁers topcomedy, al-
though “Silk"Stockings” was the
one disappointment. The , shows
have depth to ‘them, and he re-
minded, “the best comedy is often
critical and satirical and as ‘you
laugh you may be thinking.”

It’s leap year, -guys, and the women started early to

‘take advantage of that extra day in February. Friday night,
7 the women’s classes sponsored the annual “Heart Hop.”

The gals were permitted to ask the fellows, but accord-
ing to proper authorities, any man who started off to do the

asking ﬁrst was considered proper.

The spring" semester social calendar officially began Fri-

‘day night at the “Hop”; the woman who ﬁt her foot into

-dore Biddle volunteered to ﬁt the shoes. All in all, it seemed
as though the women’s class ofﬁcers had planned well for a
pleasant evening. "

We were anxious to ﬁnd out who would be Cinderella.

We also wanted to know who in this university ever
planned the Hop to come during the ‘ same week as fra-
ternity rushing? Isn’t there a calendar committee or a social.
committee in Student Congress that’s supposed to watch out

The fact that Omnibus, Pi_tt’s new student magazine
sold‘ out during the past week means that students are at
least interested in ﬁnding out what is in it. No doubt many
curious freshmen bought it duringregistration.

‘At any rate, they have a pleasant surprise coming, for
the magazine provides humor good enough to evoke chuckles
from the most pessimistic reader. A new feature We liked

was “Fits & Starts,” a series of about-the-University anec-
dotes that literally sparks. '

, The editors have changed the magazine frdm oﬁset to

changed makeup; the magazine looks good.

Editor, Pitt News:

With student political parties
about to reorganize on campus,
we feel that there should be
some statement of purpose on
the reorganization‘ of the Vet-
eran'-Independent Party, which
was a major party last year.

First of all, the Party is the

Veteran—Independent Party‘ — 1

without any such permanent
endings ‘as’ “Pitt.” Many of the
students and some of the offi-
cials of last year’s coalition con-

sider that the two parties are" ‘

one. They are not.

When the two parties agreed
on a single slate, they did not,"
in any way, agree to become a
single party. We should like this
to be completely understood.
Our purpose has been through-
out our existence to advance the
Independent on campus. We in-
tend to be as autonomous as we

By ED KOLTISKA
_, The Panthers won their

‘eighth straight dual meet of»

the season Monday night by
dumping the Mountaineers of
West Virginia 32-0. «

Coach Rex Peery’s grap-
plers came through with four
pins ‘out of eight matches to re-
cord onegof the highest scores this
season. ‘It was the fourth shutout

' out of the last ﬁve meets.

Bill Hulings wasted no time in
starting off the meet by quickly
taking down Dick Hamilton and
using a half nelson and reverse
chauncery for a pin at 2:39 in the
123-pound class.

- Guidi Loses Again

Following up in the 130-pound
class, Ed Peery got the roughest
workout of the meet from Louis
Guidi, a runner up in the NCAA
last year. Guidi tied Peery in the
second period, but lost out in the
third period as Peery picked up
three fast points for a reversal
and time advantage to win 7-4.

Vic DeFelice, a 137-pounder,
put the Panthers back in the pin
column as he reversed Al Zim-
fmerman in the second period

' and ended up with a body press

to pin Zimmerman in 4:32.‘

With the score 13-0, Bob ,Bubb

M6untaineers in the 147-pound

throughout the match but missed
a fall and settled for a 5-0 de-

Cagers J Outlast Tech?

In Overtime, 85-312

By STEVE BUTCHOCK
Carnegie Tech trailed 67-57 with six minutes left inthe
game, and it looked as if Coach Bob Timmons’ cagers would
pull away to their 13th win of the campaign without too much

trouble.

When the ﬁnal buzzer sounded at the end of regulation
time, though, the howling Tech rooters literally raised the
roof of Skibo gym as reserve forward Frank. Sobolewski

drove through the middle for a¢

layup that tied the game at 72-72
with less than ten seconds re-
maining.

Julius_Pegues brought the Tim-
monsmen from a 70-69 deficit with
35 seconds left to ,play by drop-
ping in a charity toss.

Frank Commits Foul

The Tartans then took posses-
ion of the ball and began _working
for that last shot when Alan
Frank, star center for the opposi-
tion, charged into Pegues attempt-
ing to "drive in for the winning
bucket.

Pegues calmly stepped to the
charity line and sank both of
the shots with twelve seconds
to go. The two point lead wasn’t
qutie enough, though, as Soho-

lewski’s layup sent the game I

into overtime.

Chuck Hursh and Joe Fenwick
carried the Panthers to the over-
time as both hit for six markers
in the extra session for the 85-81
win.

Fouls Hamper Panthers

Fenwick was hampered by fouls
and had to sit out much of the
second half when he picked up his
fourth personal after only three
minutes of action.

Coach Timmons withheld Fe... _ f“- -

wick from play until the 14 min-
ute mark when the Brownsville
ﬂoorman returned to action.

Bob Lazor was charged with his

fourth personal a short while la-‘
ter, and both Fenwick and Lazor.

were compelled to play conserva- -

tive basketball to keep from foul-‘

ing out against‘ the enemy who‘

was now using a full-court press.‘,

Fieler Hits Ten Straight '

At the half the Jungle Cats held»

a slim 37-36 advantage, thanks to_ ’

the deadly shooting of John Riser
with 14 points and Lazor with
eleven. ' '

This ‘ margin could con'ceiv'- 1

ably have been much greater if

it hadn’t been for Dick Feiler

who sank 16 markers to keep

his team within, striking dis ‘
tance. Fieler scored Tech’s last

ten points before the intermis-

sion.

Scoring honors for the Blue and

\

Gold went to Lazor with 26 points. ~

Following were Riser with’ ‘24,'

I-Iursh with 16, and Fenwick with
twelve.

D Runner Sowell Slumbers,
Wakes for 1956 Games

By STEVE BUTCHOCK
Sports Writer

The sun methodically forged its way through the blu-
ish—white. clouds on that typical March day in Boulder,
Colorado. . _

To the native citizens there was nothing unusual about
the day except that summer was one day nearer. Most of the
Westerners were going to go through their daily routines-
,a_trip to the office, hurry home to warm supper, and then
a relaxing evening with the newspaper‘ or the television set.

‘To a slender young speedster from the University of
Pittsburgh——Arnie Sowell-—-the brisk‘ day took on ‘a different

meaning. . .
. Before many more hours passed, Sowell would be running

against the top amateurs of the country for the National AAUA
championship in the 880. ’

This could perhaps be the most import-
ant race‘ of his young but glorious career.
When the tape had been broken after the
800 yards had been consumed by his effort-
less strides, Amazing Arnie had run the fast-
est half-mile ever. run by a collegian. T

Arnie’s time was 1:47.6, just a tenth of
a second off the world mark, held by Lou
Spurrier. Ironically, a week before, Sowell

failed to retain his half-mile NCAA title be-
Sowell « cause, according to Arnie, ,“I just fellas1eep.”
His egregious blunder in the NCAA ﬁnals, though, could
conceivably be one of the .most signiﬁcant things that has hap-'
. D ‘ pened, or will ever happen,'to the feather-running sensation.
:<‘*»”’“" Arnie learned a lesson in that race which usually comes
‘to 7 every great runner at one time or another. He learned
that you can never‘ fall asleep in competitive sports, for if
you do the other man will take advantage of your mistakes:
Advantages that will beat you when you’re cast a favorite

' ' tant race.
. In anjjlllirilsplciilard-learned lesson may remain with Arnie the rest

of his running days, which I hope are many, or he could just

pass it oﬁ as one of those things. ’

 Tothe United States Olympic team itcould be an asset
or a liability. It all depends on Arnie who is sure to make
the team unless he breaks a leg. _

Its no secret to rabid sports followers that Sowell will
be counted on heavily to help the Americans ﬁnish on top
in the (1956 Olympiad at Melbourne, Australia.

Although team point totals are kept, it is frowned upon
because it destroys the purpose for which the Olympics are

held—individual honors, not team winners. ~
The Russians look to the point total as a means of deter-

mining the superior race of people in the .W0l‘1d- If they Win,
“up:-opaganda will be heard around the world for four years.
Russia will pile up ‘points in the women’s events and
other minor sports. The United States will have1to»com-
pensate for this disadvantage, and the improvement of the’
' " Russian male athletes who train on government funds the
‘ year around with the speciﬁc‘ aim of beating the Americans.

    

 

 

track events, especially the dashes.
' When Arnie warms up before he lines up with his running
gcontemporaries, all he has to do for incentive is think back to
the spring of 1955 andthe NCAA ﬁnals. ’ '
If he takes it to heart it will‘ spur him on. And when
it-does, and the ﬁnal score is close,'the “sleep” could be one
 that is echoed around the world in the disguise of a United
A ' States victory or ._defeat over the Soviet ‘Union. '
 / V The challenge is there, and he has best wishes from this
 _5~‘g.corner. The rest is up to Arnie.’ V

The Panther swimmers took their seventh victory Satur-

The local -mermen limited Lehigh to ﬁrst in only the

the front-running teams.

In closing the season, the
Dukes, fire the Mountaineers
twice and the Panthers meet the
Tartans at the Stadium in what
should be a hotly contested bat-’
tle. Two victories for the Blue
and Gold should put the team
into the title picture which may
have to be decided by a shoot-
off ,between as many as four
teams.

With every man ﬁring in the
270’s, the Panthers have become a
constant threat to opponents, but
the inability of any of the sharp-
shooters to break -into the 280’s.
.has cost the team at least two vic-
tories this season.

Last Saturday, the Panthers
lost a close match to the Moun-

ling followers will see Saturday
night when the Panther grapplers
close out their home season at the
Field House against the University‘
of Toledo.

Throughout the nine minutes of
the match, cautious‘ grapplers are
constantly on the watch for the
attempted tackle and “takesdown”.

With a good "fake, a wrestler
can get a good leg tackle and
succeed in putting his opponent
down with‘ a reward of two
points in the scoring column.

_ While the opponent is on the
mat,» the wrestler will attempt to
“ride” the grappler until an open-

ing is found for a pin hold. As

the opponent tries to stand up, a
grapevine is used to keep control
and to break the man down to the
mat. .
The grappler, whose time ad-
vantage exceeds the others by
sixty seconds, is awarded_ one
point for riding time at the end of
the match.
If in the position of disadvan-
tage, on the bottom, a wrestler
can pick up one point for an
. “escape” to a neutral- position.

tion of control, a grappler can

In Canadian Debates

Debating at the McGill/ University Winter Carnival in
Montreal, Canada, over the past weekend, the aﬁirmative
Varsity team of Dan Levitt, Col. ’56, and Tom Jenkins, Eng.
’57, ﬁnished second behind Cornell University.

Speaking on the topic, “Resolved: That the olympic games

create more_ international tension than international good will,
the aﬂirmative swept each of the

 

ﬁrst three preliminary

rounds and amassed a _higher¢

number of points than the other
aﬁirmative teams in the competi-

;_;tion ,thus earning themselves the

right to meet, Cornell’s similarly
victorious negative team in the
ﬁnal round.

Cornell was proclaimed the
winner by a split decision of
three judges;

The negative team of Sam Reich
and Bob Rosborough, Col. ’57,
were defeated by the University
of McMaster, and the host team,
McGill University .in close -decis-

rounds after having taken the
measure of Royal Military College
in theﬁrst round. _

The aﬁirmative team’s victor-

ies were _at the expense of the

University of Toronto, Bishop’s

other feasible use for this building
_at present, he added. '
Pitt Gives Proposal

Inconnection with this $2,000,-
000 lend-lease offer, Pitt presented
to the City a proposal written by
Dr. Robert A. Moore, vice chan-
cellor of Schools of the Health
Professions, ‘that the City under-
write any losses incurred yearly in
the hospital's upkeep, up to the
deﬁcit Municipal had’ in 1948.
That year, the deﬁcit amounted to
$120,507.

Dr. Moore stated, “'I‘lie rea-
son for such a proposal is that
we want to- be sure that we
don’t have to take ‘care of pa-
tients without having the money
to do so.”

Concerning Pitt’s propsal, Dr.
Baker said, “The ‘City of Pitts-
burgh recognizes the value of Mu-
nicipal Hospital. It is aware of the
fact that there is still -an outstand-
ing bond issue on the property.

,The City feels that it must pro-

ceed carefully in considering these
terms of the University.” _
Dr. Baker explained that the '
decision of whether Pitt’s addi-
tional terms will be included in .
the transaction is up to City
Council and Mayor David L. '
Lawrence.

Neither Dr. Baker nor Dr. ’Moore
know what steps would be —taken,
either on the City’s or Pitt's part,
should the University’s proposal
be rejected. .Dr. Baker did say,
“The City .__will probably try to
furnish a counter proposition to

1' Pitt's suggestion in the next few
1  weeks." ~ "'

Hospital Built in ’41 .
Municipal" Hospital was origi-
nally built in 1941, and when.its
original purpose of treating con-
tagious diseases did not require
the whole building, the hospital
began to house other departments.

Hospital Transfer

Presently it includes the Pitt

Graduate School of Public Health,
city clinics, and laboratories of
Dr. Salk, Director ofwVirus Re-
search Laboratory.

For using part of the hospital,
Pitt pays about $23,392 in rent,
$13,610 of which is used for
utilities and maintenance costs.

“The building will be available,”
said Dr. Baker, “in the summer
of 1957, when the School of Public
Health moves out. The City has
indicated an interest in having the
University take it over even prior
to that time.” 1

‘‘Should Pitt take over the hos-
Dital,”  Moore stated, “it will
be a general medical and surgical
hospital, including the treatment
of contagious diseases.’’‘ The ten
ﬂoor structure will be converted
into a 400-bed capacity hospital.

THE CARE AND FEEDING OF ROOM-MATES”:

Today we take up room-mates, a delightful phenomenon of .
American college life.,Iria /ing a room-r.'iate is not only heaps of
fun; it is also very educational, for the proper study of mankind
is man, and there is no better way to learn the dreams and fl
drives of another human being than to share a room with him.

This being the case, it is wise not to keep the same room-mate 3
too long, because the more room.-mates you_ have, the moresyou-~?3.:.~;
will lrncw about the dreams and drives of human beings. And 
that's what we’re all after, isn’t it? A ‘ ‘

So try to change room-mates as often as you can. A recent ‘
study made by Sigafoos of Michigan State’ shows that the best,
interval for changing room-mates is every four hours. " . ,1

Now let us discuss how to go about choosing a room-mate. Most
counselors agree that the most important thing to look for in "_

1' ' room-mates is that they be.
people of regular habits. This,

I say, is arrant nonsense. What

if one of their regular habits-"
happens to be beating a great,
gong from midnight to three
a.m.? Or growing culturesin 1
the tooth glass? Or reciting  ..
the Articles of War? Or peanut \.
brittle? .

Regular habits indeed !- I say 1 

that beyond quibble, far a_nd_:: 
away the most important quaI-.”'' ”‘
ity in room-mates is‘that they

be exactly your size. Otherwise

you will have to have their‘ , 
clothesalteredto ﬁt you, which ; jx. 13;. :
can be a considerable nuisance. ,' 
In fact, it is sometimes ﬂ_atly".; '
§, impossible. I recollect one -time ' ., .--V

'5 I roonied with a man’ named "

, Tremblatt Osage who was just.
under seven feet tall and weighed nearly four hundred pounds.
There wasn’t*‘ a blessed thing I could use in his entire wardrobe-—
until one night when I was invite to ‘a masquerade party. I
cut one leg oil’ a pair of Tremblatt s trousers, jumped into it,
sewed up both /ends and went to theiparty as a bolster. (Inci- -
dentallyg, I took second prize. First prize went td a girl named

smoke. When we borrow cigarettes, do 
we Want them to be harsh, shoddy, and ‘
disdainful of our palates? Certainly
not! What, then, do we want them to
be? Why, we want them to be ‘gentle,
delicately-reared, and designed to suit
the tempo of today’s broader, easier
life! And what cigarette is gentle,
delicately-reared, and designed to suit
the tempo of today's broader, easier
life‘? Why, Philip Mo*ris, of ‘corris!

To go on. In selecting a room-mate,’
take great pains to ﬁnd someone who
will wear well, whom you’d like to keep
as a’ permanent friend. Many of his-
tory-’s great friendships first started in
college. Are you" aware, for example,
of the remarkable fact that. Johnson
and Boswell were room-mates at Ox-
ford in 1712?: What makes this fact
so remarkable is that in 1712 Johnson
was only three years old and Boswell

children matured much earlier in those
days. Take Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart
who wrote his ﬁrst symphony at the ;
age of four. Or Titian, whopainted his ﬁrst masterpiece at ﬁve-
Or Hans Otto McGrath, who was in many ways the most remark-
able of all; he was appointed chief ‘of the Copenhagen police
department at the age‘ of six! , .  ‘
_ (It must be admitted, however, that the appointment was less 2

than a success. Criminals roamed the city, robbing and looting

at will. They knew young McGrath.. would never pursue them; _
he was not ‘allowed to cross the street.) om: snuunan. use :7
