25¢ Time Schedule Fee

Postponed Until March   Police Charge Safeiy

BY SCOTT MACLEOD

The controversial time schedule
fee proposed by Vice-Chancellor of
Operations Joseph A. Dutton has
been cancelled for the winter term.

However, the 25 cent charge
will go into effect next March when
students must have time schedules
to register for the fall term.

Dutton announced the decision,
which he called a compromise, at a
meeting with representatives for

Student Government and Black
Action Society. ‘

The original proposal for the
winter term ordered a 25 cent
charge for time schedules to
eliminate waste and additional
University spending. I

Dutton emphasized that the
money save in costs of operation by
this plan-would be channeled into
academic affairs.

For the 1971-72 school year,
according to Registrar Frank Reed,
the University spent approximately
$28,000 for the printing and
distribution of time schedules.

By resorting to different printing
methods and other waste;-reducing
processes, the Operations office
managed to cut back costs $13,000
in the 1972-73 school year.

Charging a 25 cents fee for the
time schedule would almost en-
tirely eliminate the $15,000 costs
now in effect, resulting in a zero

Pressures on Lynch

Table Anti-H’

liCi‘l Law  

BY FELICE NEWMAN

Councilman John P. Lynchis
discontinuing any attempts to pass
anti-hitchhiking legislation in Pitts-
burgh. Lynch’s proposed law
would have imposed a. fine on
drivers who pick up hitchhikers.

Bob Knerr, chairman of the
Pittsburgh Blue Thumb Committee
an organization formed as a result
of the proposed law, feels,
“Councilman Lynch decided to
drop his bill because of significant
pressure." .

Representative McGraw, [D-
Allegheny County] has proposed a
similar bill in the state legislature.
The law, which is still being
drafted, calls for a $100 fine to both
the hitchhiker and the driver. The
law also provides for a 15-day
driver’s license loss to the motorist.

McGraw sighted three purposes
of such a law. “First, it would
protect the young hitchhiker who
may, in his or her innocence, be
picked up by a sexual deviate or
criminal. Second, it would protect
the motorists, who should know
better, but often pick up hitch-
hikers. Third, it is in the interests
of highway safety."

McGraw’s bill has the support of

the American Automobile Associa-
tion (AAA). Graw’.s office reported
interest in hitchhiking legislation
was triggered by the recent mass

/murders of young boys in Texas.

Organizations which have allied
with the Blue Thumb Committee
include Pittsburgh Neighborhood
Alliance, Arlington Civic Council,
Environment: Pittsburgh, National
Organization‘ of Women, Young
Americans for Freedom and
representatives from G.A.S.P.

Knerr said the supporters of Blue
Thumb “were concerned that
Lynch's bill would be an infring-
ment on the freedom and civil
rights of Pittsburgh citizens."

Concerning McGraw’s proposed
bill he added, “We hope to ask
people to write to the state and to
gather petitions. I don’t see how,
in any way, they (state legislature)
can stop sexual crimes by making
anti-hitching laws. People hitch-
hike when they don‘t have any
money. With rising gas prices
more people will be stuck . ltiwill
deter honest people but not sexual
deviates. They're already breaking
the law."

Knerr said he will meet with Pitt
commuters to ask their support.

bargaining agent. The courts will
decide if 1199P Hospital Workers’
Union will represent the workers in
labor relations with the University.

Sam McGill, psychiaric aide and
spokesman for the approximately
130 nonprofessional workers,
claims Pitt is trying to play the
court game and stall the workers
out.

According to McGill the workers
voted 64-54 last March to let the
1199P Hospital Workers’ Union
represent the nonprofessionals as
their bargaining agent in labor
relations with Pitt.

The Labor Relations Board, which
was present during the election,
claimed the proper procedures
were adhered to and saw no reason
to contest the results, explained
McGill.

The University. however, ﬁled
charges against the Labor Rela-
tions Board, claiming they used

unfair labor practices and falsified
information. added McGill. The
University then refused to grant
certification to the elected union.

McGill said since that_ time the
University has been “abusing the
hell out of the workers.” He claims
the Administration -has been
changing the job descriptions so
workers will be requiredto do any
jobs officials want them to do, even
if they are not qualified. The
Administration has also been
requiring workers to work odd
hours, McGill added.’

-..He commented, “Before long the
Administration will be firing
workers for bad attitudes.” When
asked what course of action the
workers would take, McGill would
not specify, but said, “Don’t think
workers will sit still and let this
go on though."

(GSA Re-opens Bidding_
On Law School Complex

New bids for the Law School
contruction are still being accepted
by the General State Authority
(GSA). This is the second time bids
have been open for the above
ground construction contract.

All previous bids have been
rejected, because they were too
high, the GSA said.

The GSA Board will meet in
mid-October, to decidewho will be
awarded the contract, according to
the GSA Publicity Office in
Harrisburg.

Limbach Company, Pittsburgh,
has been awarded the heating, air
conditioning and plumbing con-
tract. Work was scheduled to start
August 10.

E. C. Ernst Company, Pittsburgh,
has won the electrical contract for
the new Law School. This work was
also scheduled to start last August
10.

The elevator contract is also open
for re-bidding, as of August 23,
because previous bids have been
rejected.

BY RICHARD SWARTZ

Fire and police officials were
hindered in their efforts to reach a
dormitory ﬁre last Friday; this
incident \has prompted a harsh
evaluation of current safety proce-
dures by two campus policemen.

Officers Arnold Tarr and Regis A

Clifford, both of whom responded
to the call on the 14th floor of
Tower B, have expressed serious
concern for the
residents, in light of the obstruc-

:' tions which converged upon their

rescue attempt. A The lack of a
single operative elevator, in add-
ition to locked security doors on the
14th floor itself, could have
resulted in the loss of someone’s
life, according to Tarr.

“By the time I reached room

1417 with the portable oxygen tank, A
A 10 minutes had elapsed,” Tarr

revealed. “Had someone been
sleeping in the room or been
unable to leave it, he would’ve
been dead by the time we reached
him.”

The fire had originated in a trash
can and was contained within
minutes. But both officers agreed
that the smoke was sufficiently
thick to have suffocated any
trapped occupants.

The reason for the prolonged
rescue effort was attributed pri-
marily to the Tower B elevators:
One was being held on the 12th
floor via the emergency stop

button, one was stranded between P

the lobby and the ground floor, and
other would not rise beyond the
sixth floor. This predicament
forced the officers to ascend 14
flights of stairs.

Upon arriving at the security

doors, the party was able to enter _

the living areaon the 14th floor
only because the master key had
been obtained at the Towers Desk.
Campus policemen do not possess
individual keys, andhad someone
neglected to obtain the m ster key,
the response to the alarm would
have been further delayed.
Clifford levelled criticism at the
Housing administration for what he
termed a deplorable‘ situation.
“Unless the University Police
are provided with duplicate sets of
the master key, there are going to
be similar crises in the future,”
Clifford contended. “And it won’t
be confined to fires either. We

handle emergency illnesses andi

situations every week that demand
clear access to every part of these
dormitories. Someday, a student's

life may hinge on the extra 60_

seconds it takes for us to reach his
location."

The Tower dormitories are
ﬁreproof, according to an official in
the University’s Health and Safety
Department, but no one is certain if

the structures can contain a fire to’

the floor of its origin. If they
cannot, then the operation of the
elevators becomes a critical factor
for the handicapped students in the
building. . _

BY DREW PORVAZNIK

The proposed $5 adds-drop fee’

and 25 cent time schedule charge
were discussed at the Student
Government Board (SGB) meeting

lWednesday night.

Joseph.Dutton, Vice Chancellor of
Operations, says he has no
intention of collecting the add-drop
fee but hopes the threat of
collection will reduce abuses of the
add-drop process.

'Rege Kaufman, SGB president,
said the threatened fee would not

solve the problem because the

problem is the result of an

inefficient advising system.

After a Monday meeting with
Dutton, both parties agreed to form
a task force to explore the problem
of add-drop and to offer solutions.

 The task force will consist of Ira
Dichter and Tim Ging from SG, Dr.
‘Robert Marshall, Dean of CAS, Dr. 

Fred Koloc,, Director of the
Advising Center and a representa-
tive from Dutton’s office and the
Provost’s office.

Kaufman also reported on another
meeting with Dutton in which the
Vice Chancellor proposed a 25 cent
charge for the time schedules.
Dutton felt this would eliminate
waste. Kaufman said there were
alternatives to the 25
cent charge.

Specifically, Kaufman said there
can be a space provided on the
student validation card that can be
punched when a student picks up
his schedule booklet from the

   Discusses Fees, Hifching

felt, would eliminate waste because
students could only receive one
time schedule.

Bob Heister reported that he and
Tim Ging met with Charles Dees,
Director of Student Aid, to discuss
the new Financial Aid Book.
Heister was pleased with the new
publication, which spells out
financial aid procedures. The book
will soon be ready for distribution.

SGB also passed a resolution by
Heister condemning Pittsburgh
councilman John Lynch’s bill to
ban hitchhiking in the City.
Heister contended Lynch’s propos-
al was, “infringing on personal

All three alternate plans, it was

freedom” and that hitchhiking was
a means of transportation for some
Pitt students.

Registrar’s Office.

Other alternatives, proposed in-
clude setting up booths to
distribute the schedules. Having
advisors distribute the schedules
was also discussed.

“When a fire alarm sounds,”
Clifford elaborated, “the desk
personnel behing the Towers desk
have instructions to bring all the
cars to the ground floor and render
all but theimiddle one inoperative.
This is the one which the police and
firemen must use. However, it's
also the one for which handicapped
students have a call-key. A
multi-floor fire can place their lives
in serious jeopardy."

Both men stipulated that_ such a
system is a widely-used procedure,
but that this did not sanction
endangering human lives. As for
the poor showing of the elevators
last Friday, Clifford reproached
students who have vandalized,
abused, and tampered with the

25¢ Time Schedule Fee

(Continued from Page 1)

budget for the 1973-74 fiscal year.
Reed said.
He added that if. a fee were

attached to time schedules this

winter, the University could save
approximately $6900.

However, ‘since the idea was
vetoed by Student Government
representatives,’ the money will not
be saved. ‘

“Our only intention is to recover
the costs of printing,” Dutton said.
“We are not out to make a profit.

“If we get that $15,000, he
(Chancellor Posvar) doesn’t have it
to give to the library or somebody
else," Dutton continued.

“And any dollar that we can
freeze up will go back to the
teaching effort," explained Dutton.

“Something has to be done soon
about these people,” he cautioned.
“One car was wired to operate
continuously from the lobby to the
18th floor and then back again,
with no respite, so eventually it just
burned itself out. Another was
being abused by means of the
emergency stop button. Students
have used it far too indiscrim-
inately.”

Clifford proposed arraigning
offenders before some kind of
student judicial board for punitive
action. “The University can little
afford to assume liability for the
conduct of students who display no
regard for their fellow boarders,”
he maintained.

Both officers assented to the
proposition that a meeting between

Ira Dichter, of the Student
Government Allocations Commit-
tee raised the philosophical point of
the 25 cent fee versus the
precedent it will create.

“What happens when the 25
cent fee doesn’t cover the costs
anymore?" Dichter asked. “Will it
go up next year?”

After the meeting, Sue Ruffner
of Student Government reacted to
the agreements.

“I think that Mr. Dutton was

if 

really fair in this particular subject.  

He was talking costs and we were
talking University commitments to
the students," Ruffner said. _

“I am pleased that there isn't,

going to be a fee this winter and I
think the way he (Dutton) left it,
some things are still negotiable,”
Ruffner added. '

Campus Cops Charge Safety Hazard

the police, the students, and the
Housing office is necessary to
correct the existing flaws. “What
we need is a session where we can

evaluate every procedure from ‘

scratch,” Tarr advised.

The potentiality for tragedy
already exists. A cursory inspec-
tion by the Pitt News has
uncovered a sample of negligence
that could provide the touchstone
for a crisis of large proportions.
Glass panels that house the fire
hoses in ‘the Towers, as well as the
Student Union, have an emergency
procedure sheet attached to them
which contains a number to dial in
case of a fire. The number is an old
University exchange: 7345. It is a
number that does not work. Ever.

“Let's start with the punchline:
After 14 years of study and
personal investigation, I am con-‘“
vinced that the evidence is
overwhelming that the Earth is
b ing visited by intelligently

~co trolled vehicles whose origin is

off the Earth,” nuclear physicist
Stanton T. Friedman said, opening
his lecture “Flying Saucers Are
Real" in the S.U. Ballroom.
Friedman, who is the only space

on a number of radio and TV‘

Friedman cited several scientific
UFO studies. The biggest report
was done by Batal Memorial
Institute in Columbus, ‘Ohio for the
Air Force in January 1971, and was

“The first reason is that most

about them. Secondly, the
‘laughter curtain’ or fear of ridicule
hinders the reporting and invest-

Moving to the question: “Never

mind the saucer--Did you see the
guys who were’ driving?”
Friedman claimed that people have
observed EEMS, Earth Excursion
Mobles, with inhabitants. In
support, he cited the famed “Hill
Case” which was described in a
book entitled, The Interrupted
Journey by John G. Fuller and is
a soon-to-be-released movie.

The book deals with a true story
of a couple, Betty and Barney Hill,
who claimed to have encountered a
UFO while on a trip from Canada to
New Hampshire in 1961. Friedman

retold the story: Mrs. Hill said she
saw a saucer following them on
their trip when it was discovered ~

tion two hours later than had been
scheduled. A

missing two hours. lWhen the
recordings were heard, ‘it was
found that each reported the same
experience dealing with being
taken on the saucer, examined, and A
told not to remember what had
happened. In their normal state
they didn’t remember. I '
Under hypnosis Mrs. Hill tells of It

the leader of the saucer speaking 2 '

English, but with an accent, and
the communication between the
inhabitants to be a mumuring. An
artist’s conception of her descrip-

places them in the “humanoid”
category, Friedman noted.

Letters to the E d ito r

Pill" Band-No
Major Change

Dear Editor:

Concerning Mr. “Baillie’s” letter
about the “ultra-conservative half-
time policies” of the Pitt Band.

Just because Johnny Majors has

‘taken this University by storm,
doesn’t mean he’s going to change
everything here, as I'm sure he
doesn’t want to. He has already
taught his team to play with pride
for four quarters. That in itself is a

- remarkable feat. But one of the
things he doesn’t want to change is
the band, and the way we perform.

‘a In fact, when he first came to this

campus, the band was rehearsing
in Pitt stadium for our performance
at the Steelers-Raiders game last
December. He came out onto the
field to meet us, and was
immediately impressed with our-_
spirit, as we were with his, and
since then we have worked closely
with him.
Face it, you cannot possibly
blame the apathy of the student
body in the second half of the
Baylor game on the performance of
the Pitt Band at half-time.
only thing that can change this
apathy is a change in the team,
which, even at this early stage,
Johnny Majors has definitely
‘ made. The first time they got their
hands on the ball in
the second half of the Baylor game,
they scored, regardless of the
absence of spirit in the stands.
This is not to say that the tepm is
not inspired by an enthusiastic
crowd but they are more inspired
by what a coach says to them and
does for them in the locker room at
half-time. If they aren’t prepared
by the coach to come out and
correct the mistakes they made in
the first half, no amount of
cheering is going to prepare them.
I’ve strayed from the point of my
letter, but these things must be
brought up to Mr. “Baillie” and
others like him.
At pre-game for this first game,
believe me, the band was as
-,“psyched” as the football team
was. We marched down the ﬁeld to
the “Victory Song”, saluted the
visitors by playing their fight song,
played to “Hail to Pitt”, and then
the National Anthem. At that time
the crowd was cheering wildly. In
the half-time entrance we formed
the traditional Panther Head and
played the Alma Mater, the most
sacred song of the University. And

The -

if that isn't enough to bring a lump
to your throat and a tear to your
eye, then your college experience
has been an extremely shallow one.

We then performedtour half-time
show. It was a good show,
dedicated to women. (Since when
are half-time shows supposed to be
relevant to the games in which they
are performed?) At that time we
received scattered applause from
those not at the refreshment
stands.

Where was the spirit that was
prevalent at pre-game? It was
gone, not because of the band, but
because of disappointment that the
team wasn’t blowing Baylor off the
field. The crowd was not patient.
They expected a perfect team
overnight. But a program as
deeply mired as our football

, program was, is not going to be

rebuilt by anyone, not even Johnny
Majors, in two games.
blame the band for the lack of
enthusiasm in the crowd. If we
would have played a half-time show
dedicated entirely to Pitt, the
enthusiasm would not have been
there. We were still losing, 14-0,
and playing badly. The crowd
wasn’t disappointed because the
band didn’t do ‘a half-time show
dedicated to the “Major change”
in Pitt football. They were
disappointed by the fact that the
change in Pitt football wasn’t as
major as they were led to believe.
Had we been leading that game
14-0 and playing good football, the
half-time show would’ve gone over
great.

People come to football games to
see football, not the half-time
show. But those people, few as
they were, who watched the show
and listened to the music, were not
disappointed. The Pitt Band
performed as it ‘always does, and
will continue to do. It’s going to
take time to build a good football
team, but until then, the band will
do the best we can, giving 100% all
the time, to entertain the crowd
between the halves. As far as our
uniforms are concerned, they are
as sharp-looking as you will ﬁnd.
Admittedly, they are conservative,
military uniforms, but our band is a
disciplined, military—type organ-
ization, which is our style, has been
for a long time, and there is no
need to change now.

The Pitt band has always
provided a smart, snappy, enter-
taining half-time show that is done
well, with modern music, and in
good taste. That is one of our main
functions at this University. The

Don’t'

other functions of the marching
band are to try and instill some
spirit in the_ students at pep rallies,
which we do to the best of our
ability, and to represent our
University well when we travel to
perform at away‘ games. And I
assure you, that if there is one
organization on campus that
supports the team, even when
they’re down, it’s the band, and
that’s before halftime, after half-
time, all the time. ’

One of the University’s greatest
traditions is the band, and
every time we take the ﬁeld, we are
exemplifying that tradition by
giving the‘ very most we, as
individual band members of the
VMB can, to do something we
really believe in. Half-time
performances are not meant to fill
the stadium with spirit and
enthusiasm. That spirit must exist
within the students, as it does
within the band members. We
have kept the spirit that used to
exist in Pitt stadium in years gone
by. Only time will tell if that old
spirit still in the band can be
rekindled in the student body, by
coach Majors, the team, and the
students themselves. However,
until then, don’t make the band the
scapegoat for an apathetic, lethar-
gic student body.

Heavy Traffic

Dear Editor,

In her letter(Pitt News, Sept. 21)
Nancy Bitensky Henderson has, in
my opinion, misinterpreted both
the film, Heavy Traffic, and the
review of it by Jess Brallier. Her
basic error is in construing Heavy
Traffic’s depiction of blacks, Jews,
women, etc. as a defense for racism
and sexism. Writer/ Director Ralph
Bakshi intended to show (News-
week, 8/27/73), “how screwed up
we are in our sexual attitudes in
this country.” His portrayals of
women are not intended to
commend the conditions that force
them into violent and desparate
acts but rather to condemn these
conditions.
portray the conditions one intends
to ameliorate. The awfulness of
racism cannot be effectively criti-
cized without the use of examples.

In the case of Heavy Traffic,
Bakshi is actually rather sympa-
thetic and understanding to his
underdog characters. Bakshi
certainly did not intend his film to

To do so, one must

BY JOHN METCALFE

I am a driver, partly through necessity, and partly,
I admit through choice. Until recently, the
alternatives have seemed to be uniformly dreadful.
Hitchhiking is often too chancy and too difficult to
schedule into the busy life of a metropolitan
University. This is odd; when I look for a parking
space on my street, most of Pittsburgh seems to live
and park within a block of this spacious mansion.
When I need a ride, nobody is going anywhere near
here.

PAT buses help, but not much. They are inclined
to go where they want to when they want to; their
schedules do not take mine into account at all, and
_most of the ones that stop in front of Hillman Library
are going to all sorts of exotic places I wouldn’t even
consider visiting. '

Buses are scheduled to be full all the time.
Unproductive runs are promptly dropped, and at
times of the day when it might be difficult to fill
buses that come every hour, the damned things come
every other hour. So I drive.

I drive a clumsy small bus, or van, of the German
nationality and the 1962 vintage. It is blue, except
for the rust spots and a large panel of galvanized
steel on one side where the house paint didn’t stick.
It is inclined to get sick every so often, at an
inconvenient time, if possible.

For a while, I had the services of the only honest
mechanic 1 ever met; for instance, he would change

' I

an engine; take it out and install another in its place
for twenty-five dollars. A prince among men. To my
knowledge, he never invented a problem and then
claimed to have fixed it, he never did work that was
not requested, and he never multiplied a bill he
should have added. He is gone.

That was too strong. He is still alive, I am sure,
but his splendid garage is no more. Construction was
going on next door, and the contractor undermined
the foundations of my favorite garage.

Since then, my bus decided to get along on three
cylinders. I accepted this. It spent its extra energy
learning to make new and alarming noises. I.wept,
but I went along with the new. Something in the
chest of drawers, probably a spoon behind a drawer,
began rattle. Easier to bear than to fix.

Now, though, one of _the three working cylinders
has taken up apathy as a way of life. I am desolate.
The bus is in the hands of people I hardly dare to
trust; they are strangers and probably burglars. I am
reduced to a life of humble pedestrianism for at least
a while. Waiting for buses. Waiting some more.
Hunting for change. Robbing the infant’s piggy
bank.

By God, I won’t do it! I shall hitchhike instead. Do
your best to revive my sense of hope. Pick me up and
take me to Highland Park.

Iwill be carrying a large briefcase, and wearing a
mournful expression.

approve racism.. On the contrary,
in Newsweek, Bakshi said, “I love
Black people. I’m very sympa-
thetic to them."

Characterization is admittedly,
perhaps intentionally, sketchy. As
they are caricatures, it is im-
possible to take Bakshi’s characters
seriously enough to consider them
as taking part in“the spreading of
degenerate ideas.”

Jess Brallier has written an astute

and perceptive review which notes
that the film’s “...picture of life is
not a pretty one” but does not
support racist attitudes. Brallier
notes that “Jews, blacks, the Mafia
and cripples are all laughed at and
finally spat on” but doesn’t praise
such attitudes. He is justified in
noting‘ Bakshi’s promise as an
animator and while praising the
film, does not find it without fault.

Nancy Bitensky Henderson min-
interprets Bral1ier’s praise of Bak-
shi’s abilities as praise for racism,
which was not the intent of either
film or review. Ms. Henderson has
erred in transferring the opinions
of Heavy Traffic characters to its
author and in the process has
maligned Jess Brallier’s fine
review.

Sincerely.

Book Exchange

, Dear Editor,

We are writing this letter in reply
to the article by George Zrust in
Monday, Sept. 10 Pitt News. In the
article entitled “The Would-be
Pennypincher” he levels several
criticisms against the Alpha Phi
Omega used book exchange.

He first states that the book
exchange fails to impress him. If
Mr. Zrust had any idea of the
amount of work that goes into
receiving, selling, and returning
6,500 books, he would not make
this statement. We started
working on this fall’s BX last

March and worked on it throughout
the summer. '
Mr. Zrust also wrote that through
no fault of the fraternity, the
selection of books is not what it is at
the Book Center. Although he
takes the blame from us he makes
it seem that we don’t have many
useful or up-to-date books at the
book exchange. We must depend
upon the students for the books
that we sell. If a new book is used
in a course we won’t have it at the
book exchange. However, only a

few courses each term use new A

books, so the vast majority of books
are potentially available at our book
exchange. Whether we have books
or not depends if the student brings
them in. Even if a student only
purchases a few of his books at the
book exchange he can save a
considerable amount of money.
Mr. Zrust’s third criticism was the
disarray on the tables. The basic
reason for this is that we are unable
to obtain a sufficient number of
tables. The staff in the Student
Union do their best but even with
that we are short of tables and thus
have to pile the books on the tables.
As the students go through the
books they end up in total disarray.
We try to straighten them but we
are constantly fighting a losing
battle. ~
The book exchange is a service to
the students at ‘Pitt. we, the
brothers, do not want to pay the
high prices at the Book _Center and
we know the students don’t want to
either. If Mr. Zrust, on the other

Pickin' and Ficlcllin’ of Bluegrass Fest

BY CHARLES W. OGG

Fall was welcomed in a good old
toe-tapping fashion with the sound
of Banjos and fiddles in York, Pa.
“The Pennsylvania Folk Arts
Society proudly busts its buttons
with pride to present the First
Annual Pennsylvania Indian Sum-
mer Country, Gospel-Bluegrass
and Blues Folk Music Arts
Festival,” read the sign at the
entrance.

A festival it was. Muscic playing
and the sound of falling leaves
accompanied several thousand
campers and day-goers.

The grounds came complete with
outdoor covered stage and ben-
ches, restaurant,
large field for camping, and a
variety _of small time capitalists
selling candles, belts, records, and

9 other assorted items.

The folk seemed to be a distinct
mixture of young long haired types
and older, more conservative
family members, who often
brought their kids. The festival is
considered a “family event”, and
often the MC would_urge that “All
alcholic beverages be kept away
from the playing area.”

Despite differences there was
little tension in the crowd. The
complexion often changed as a
function of which group was
playing.

Long hairs were more prevalent
when groups such as “The
Breakfast Special" played.’ They

- routines,

picnic tables,

mixed bluegrass, rock and jazz with
the use of a fiddle, mandolin,
dobro, bass guitar, and sometimes
a sax; reflecting the “more
sophisticated” influence of the
north.

The group which “brought the
house down” was the “Star
Spangled Washboard Band,” di-
rect from Woodstock, New York.
They project the craziness of
ragtime and mix it with comedy
bluegrass, social and
political commentary;* including
anti-Nixon satire, a pro marijauna
song, and the best ragtime
typewriter yet.

The faces in the audience changed
considerably Sunday morning.
Many families came out for a
pleasant morning of gospel-blue-
grass.

The Allen Brothers, sons of the
famed Red Allen, who appeared
afterwards, treated them to a
number of slow harmonies, along
with delicate traditional instru-
mentation. Also appearing were
such well known artists as Charlie
Moore, the Carter Family, and
Jimmy Martin.

One interesting phenomenon was
the crowd’s response to those
songs which appear on the Nitty
Gritty Dirt Band’s album “Will The
Circle Be Unborken,” made in
conjuction with many of these

artists; it was very favorable. As I

ROBERT BREER:

Animation Workshop

Early in 1973 Robert Breer won the eleventh
Independent Film Award for “his unique con-
tribution to the language of cinema in the ex-
ploration of the thresholds of rapid montage.”
From Monday, October 1 to Wednesday, October
3 Breer will be in Pittsburgh to conduct a work-
. shop in the essentials of animation. He will “de—
mystify” the whole process of single—frame ani-
mation by first showing a series of films to sup-
ply students with an historical background, and
second, by guiding and working with students
as they make films during the course of the
workshop. Breer will emphasize the “simplest,
freest, and most inexpensive methods of animat-
ing film images.” The workshop is aimed at be_-
ginners but is so structured that advanced ani-
mators can pursue their own projects within the
format of the meetings. The class will meet each
evening from 7:30 to 10:30 p.m. at the__F'ilm

Then Country-Western popped its
head in with the “Cheatin’
Hearts,” dressed in bright green
with red hearts and sporting
electric instruments; mainly a
backup band for such stars as Merl
Kilgore and Hank Williams Jr.

While all this music was happen-
ing I had the chance to talk to a
“security” person, a guy about my
age. I learned he was being paid
food and $25 in exchange for
working at the festival. The idea is
to sign up ahead of time. I asked
Jim Clark, who coordinated the
festival, if he needs help from, say,
college students, with running
festivals, and he said yes enthusi-
astically.

York wasn't the ‘only festival this
year. These festivals occur

elsewhere. If anyone would like to

 Take Up 
 The Slack

EVANSTON, Ill.--If Johnny Majors thought he had injury problems
in the Baylor game, he must be wondering whether he’s running a
hospital ward or coaching a football team as he prepares for

‘ itomorrow’s Pitt-Northwestern game.

Gary Burley was the only Panther who made the Georgia trip that

_ was unable to play against Baylor. Although that’s only one player,

that one player is probably the most valuable one on the team... With
Burley in there at middleguard, it’s doubtful that Baylor would have
completed either of its 90-yard scoring drives. ‘ °
j Well, Burley was expected to have recovered from his ankle injury
that he suffered in the Georgia game in time to play here tomorrow.
The recovery has not been as speedy as had been expected, and Burley
is listed as doubtful for the game. “I guarantee you that I’ll be ready
for the Tulane game though,” said the 250-pound titan with a big grin
on his face, which will thrill the Green Wave.
One of the middleguards who ﬁlled in for Burley was freshman Don

 Parrish. Parrish was injured in the Baylor game, and did not make the
I - _ trip. Majors has not yet decided who will start at middleguard. Among

the contenders are two freshman that did not make the trip to Georgia,
Al Romano and Cecil Johnson. ‘ »
A Pitt’s top kick returner, Robert Haygood, had to be replaced due to

injury. Baylor tried very hard to keep its kicks away from Haygood,‘

and only time will tell if his replacements, Clifton Cranford and Dennis
Moorehead, will earn a similar reputation.

When Burley missed the Baylor game, the squad was told that it
would have to take up the slack. There is a lot more slack to be taken
up this week, but the Panthers are going into the game highly
conﬁdent, but not over-confident as they wefe going into the Baylor
‘ game. 3

“The Baylor game toned down the attitude of the team,” said guard
Reynold Stoner. “We realize that our objectives are farther away than
we’d thought they were.”

‘ Offensive captain (for the game) Ray Olsen said, “We just have to
learn from our mistakes and get ready for the next game.”

Rod Kirby, the Panther linebacker who has been Cat of the Week,
and the recipient of other rewards as well, such as being named
defensive captain, said, “Although I may have played well personally,

tel won’t be satisfied until we win a game.”

Pitt’s offensive strategy will change somewhat over the Baylor

‘ game, featuring a little more passing, to go along with Tony Dorsett’s
running. “We’ll play a more wide-open game,” said Daniels. “The

coaches are getting more confidence in us.
I. predict that Pitt will have its first victory of the season tomorrow,
despite all the injuries. One must remember that Pitt almost beat

7 Northwestern last year, when nobodyjknew who Gary “Burley was. Last

year we didn’t have Dorsett, and that’s enough right there.

Due to the injury to Haygood,
Moorehead will be called upon to
do some of the punt returning.
Clifton Cranford will also return
punts, and kickoffs as well.

trip, Bill Daniels is still ﬁrmly
entrenched as the starting quarter-
back. Daniels has been one of the
few Panthers who has received
constant raves in the press from
Majors. “He’s by far the most
improved player on the team.”

repeated Majors.

Daniels was not overly im-
pressed with his 10 for 16 passing
performance in the Baylor game.
even though many of the incomple-
tions were dropped by receivers.
“10 for 16 is not an exceptional
game, and it doesn’t matter how
well you play if the team loses,”
said the blond-haired junior.

Majors said he was pleased with
the squad’s workouts this week,
but hastened to add that he felt the
same way last week. “We had

more hitting this week,” said
Majors. “The practices were good,
but they weren’t extremely long.”

The extra hitting took its toll, as
several players came up with
bruises, and may not be at 100%
for the game.

Northwestern will be playing
before its student body for the first
time this season, as the Wildcats’
previous home game was played
weeks before classes began.

Boaters Bo w To Zips  

BY G. W. STEVENS

The Pitt soccer team ‘suffered’ its
second loss of the season Wednes-
day afternoon in Pitt Stadium when
a powerful team from Akron

_ University defeated them by, a

score of 3-0. The Zips came to town
with a 0-1-1 record, and had not
scored a goal in either of the
previous outings.
they came ﬂying, and the Pitt
booters soon realized that they

Nevertheless, 3

were facing some tough opposition.
The game began as a struggle

between the Pitt defense and the-

Akron offense. The Zips controlled

the game for most of the first half ~-

but were held in check by the fine‘
play of Pitt goalie Bill Haines and’
the rest of the defensive crew. But,
near the end of the first half the
defense ﬁnally let down, which was
all the Akron team needed. Taking
advantage of Pitt’s inability to clear
the ball from in front of the goal,

  Icers Funded;
 Set Schedule

The Pitt Hockey Club is back on
its feet for the 1973-74 season, after
receiving an allocation of approxi-
mately $2,300 from Student Gov-
ernment. The financial backing

/came this week after a long series
of delays and further investigation
by Student Government into
alternate sources that could have
funded the club.

The skaters immediately set a
practice schedule and announced a
tentative game schedule at a
general meeting Wednesday night.

The first_ practice will be held at
the Sewickley Arena next Tuesday
night at 9:00 p.m., to be followed
by a Thursday practice at 8:00 p.m.
also at Sewickley.

Pitt will play 9 games in the Civic
Arena as part of a hockey
doubleheader setup. The double-
headers will be played on Saturday

a‘ and Sunday afternoons and Sunday f events

M?

evenings. Pitt will also play away
contests at the Alpine Arena,
Belmont Arena and the Kirk Nevin
Arena.

Bart Mack was named the new
president-general manager and
Mark Lieberman retained his post
as treasurer-secretary for the
1973-74 campaign, in elections held
at Wednesday’s meeting.

Since the club did not receive the
financial backing it had last season,
the skaters may have to foot most
of the bill themselves. An initiation
fee of $20 and weekly ice time dues

of $5 are mandatory of each
member.
“Its a lot to ask." Mack

emphasized, “but we have no other

1 choice at the moment. We plan to

return as much of the money, as
possible, depending on our success

«with ticket sales and fund raising.

George Nauchoff fired a blistering
shot past Haines for Akron’s first
goal of the season.

The second half proved to be quite
similar to the first with Akron again
controlling much of the play. The
Panthers were unable to capitalize
on their scoring opportunities but
continued to play their usual tough
defensive game. The Zips were
able to take advantage of every Pitt
mistake as Richard Parkinson and
Joe Bartolomeo added two more

goals putting the game out of

reach.

Pitt Coach Leo Bemis had nothing
but praise for the Akron team,
which is comprised of more foreign
than American players. “We were
up against a very good team. They
played well together. They were
very fast and handled the ball well. '
Our squad played a very good
game we were just hurt by a few
bad mistakes."

The loss to Akron now sets the
Panthers at 1-2-1. They still have
the major part of their schedule left
and Coach Bemis is contemplating
some lineup changes. In any
event, he does feel that the players’
will have to work harder during the
next few weeks. “We still have
quite a bit of work to do before we
reach a point where we can score
on a first-class team."

The Panthers go into action again
tomorrow at the Stadium against a
team from Edinboro College.

Tomorrow's contest will begin at
l_:30, and the Pitt squad hopes that
they will get a better turnout for the
games. In the past, the Pitt fans
haveibeen outnumbered by those
from the visitingischools. In any
event,» those attending the game‘

are sure to see plenty of action. - 7

Harriers Face Test In K

BY RICK SHRUM

Saturday afternoon. A vacation
day for the working class. A
hangover day for the drinking
class. A sleeping day for the
Introductory Russian class. A
judgement day for Pitt cross-
country coach Jim Banner.

Last Saturday Banner’s embry-
onic sextet traveled to California,
Pa. for the Cal. State Invitational.
The Panther runners put on an
impressive performance in their

opening meet, to (nudge past
rapidly improving West Virginia.

Although Banner was pleased
with his team’s performance, he
was cautious of showing too much
optimism so early in the season.,

A He realized that his boys did not

beat a great field, and did make
mistakes. The coach refused to
pass judgement on his team until
they received an acid test.

Pitt’s harriers will receive such a
test this Saturday morning, when
Kent State comes to town for a

Ivy ’s Challenge Yagis

,gI

11:15 meeting in Schenley Park.
The Golden Flashes annually have
a first-rate track program, and this
year is no exception.

“They are a track power again
this year," said Banner. “Last
year they won MAC (Mid-Ameri-
can Conference) titles in track and
cross-country, and return two
excellent long-distance runners in
Mike Ehrman and Bill Kirk.”

Ehrman will pose the biggest
problem for “Banner’s Babies.”

He competed in the steeplechase
for the U.S. in last year's
University Games, and recorded
one of the finest 1972 times in that
event.

Although the results of Kent’s
opener against Western Michigan
wei'e unknown to Banner, he had
heard from a reliable source that
Ehrman and Kirk had done well,
and are physically ready for Pitt.

However, the lean and mean
Panthers are ready to do some
growling of their own. The
ever—contagious ﬂu bug has hit
no one, and the only physical
problems sustained from California
“were the typical post-meet aches
and pains.”

Practice, that colossal exercise in
drudgery, left Banner particularly
pleased. He believed that “some
of our best work was accomplished
this week,” and that “practice has
molded us into a very cohesive
unit, which is a very important.
aspect of cross-country.”

Both teams head into the battle

with self-confidence and respect for
one another. The Flashes have two
break-away threats, but the Pan-

runners who can put the match

At this point, about the only thing
certain is that Saturday's meet

could well determine the season’s I
