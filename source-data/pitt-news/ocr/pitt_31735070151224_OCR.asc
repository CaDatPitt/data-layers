A Pitt alum currently serving as P
director ofthe U.S. Department of
Commerce’s National Institute of
Standards and Technologywill serve
as the featured speaker at the Univer-
sity’s commencement ceremonies
on April 28. .
Patrick D. Gallagher, who received
his master’s and doctoral degrees in
physics at Pitt in 1987 and 1991, re-
spectively, has served as director of
the NIST since Nov. 20, 2009, when
President Barack Obama appointed
him to the position. Gallagher was
appointed deputy director of the
program in 2008 and was named
director 13 months later.
_ During his two—decade career at
the NIST, Gallagher has held a num-
ber of leadership positions in the or-
ganization, including director of the
NIST Center for Neutron Research.
_ In a statement from Pitt’sv Ofﬁce

‘ of Public Affairs, Pitt Chancellor

Mark Nordenberg championed Gal-
lagher’s dedication to natural-science
research, an area he said is of particu-
lar interest to Pitt, since the school
is one of the leading public research
universities in the world.

“As director of the National In-
stitute for Standards and Technol-
ogy, [Gallagher] also recognizes that
research universities play a key role
in the technological innovation and
medical and scientiﬁc research that

‘ have helpedfuel the economic growth
of our nation,” Nordenberg said. .

Students develop corruption-tracking website

Gideon Bradshaw
Senior Staﬁ. Wrz‘ter

For Vishal Vinayak, who grew up in
the northern-Indian state of Punjab,
it has never been a secret that cor-
ruption is rampant in his homeland.

He said that one of his acquain-
tances in India reﬁased to bribe apo-

' liceman who demanded one when

she applied for a passport.
Vinayak’s friend ‘didn’t received

her passport. When she reapplied '

for one, the same policeman again
demanded abribe. This time she paid
and received it.;

“Everyone knows that there is
corruption, but there is no platform
where they can share knowledge,”
he said. "

Vinayak wantsto provide that
platform, and has spearheaded -de-
_ velopment of a model to create a

website where users in developing
nations can report instances of cor-

‘ ruption —~ though the team intends

to implement the site in India ﬁrst.
On April 3, the Randall Family Big
Idea Competition, an annual contest
held by the Joseph M. Katz School
of Business and College of Business

' Administration, awarded Vinayak

and his team $5,000 for the model

. of their website, “Corrupt or Not.”

Kartikjohari, who will complete
an MBA this semestergjessie Moober-
ry, a graduating senior who majors in
ﬁnance; Jon Hewson, a junior who
majors in ﬁnance, and Meenal Patel,
a Ph.D. candidate in bioengineering,-

' have all worked with V_'inayak,.who I

will also earn his MBA this semester,
on the project. ‘ ‘ P

Once the site gets up‘ and running, V

users- will be able to’ share stories
about whatvvinayak calls “micro—
corruption,” ‘which he deﬁned as

government and law enforcement ‘

officials demanding illegal bribes
from ordinary citizens.

A problem that preys on citizens

The Indian government has ac- ‘

knowledged the problem rnicrocor-
ruption poses and has taken mea-
sures in recent years to curb it.
According to press releases, the
Indian government .has enacted
legislation such as the 2010 judicial
Standards and Accountability Bill,
which aims to hold the country’s
judges to standards of transparency

CORRUPTION

and enables citizens to ﬁle complaints against
judges conﬁdentially. Several otherbills aimed
at strengthening previous anti-corruption at-
tempts, including one aimed at protecting
whistleblowers, are still pending.

Between 2007 and 2012, the Indian govem—
ment investigated or prosecuted allegations
of corruption for 122 high-level civil servants.
Additionally, the government has conducted
sweeps to uncover corruption among law en-
forcement officers.

But Vinayak and Johari, who grew up in
Bombay, said these measures are failing, and
that many Indian civil servants and police-of-
ﬁcers are not afraid to extort citizens for bribes.

Many of the bribes sound to Americans like
small sums of money ,— V1nayak’s acquaintance
only needed to pay the rough equivalent of $15
to get her passport. But petty corruption costs
its victims dearly. Estimates by the Indian gov-
emment’s Central Statistical Ofﬁce place the
country’s average per—capita monthly income
around $105. Many poor and unemployed In-
dians live on far less.

According to government press releases,
a 2007 study of corruption in India by Trans-
parency International found that two-thirds
of Indian households living belowthe poverty
line did not receive certain government services
because they could not pay bribes.

Vinayak and his team said they hope their
crowdsourcing approach, in which a commu-
nity of users will contribute content, will suc-

ceed where Indian laws have not. Although the’_

website “I Paid a Bribe” currently allows users to
post testimonials about bribery inlndia, those
who post on the site do not identify the officials.
Vinayak said that Corrupt or Not will.
Vinayak,Johari and Mooberry agreed that
the site will give ordinary people a chance to

expose officials who shake them down, creating
a stigma against microcorruption.

“The buzz word we’re working off of here
is public shaming,” Mooberry said.

Users of Corrupt or Not will be able to log
on and report corrupt individuals by name and
will be able to provide their own names or to
post anonymously. The site will record infor-

mation on corrupt individuals so that users can _

view multiple reports about a single individual.
Reports about the officials on the site will be
twice the length of a tweet —— a total of 280
characters.‘ The site’s content will also include
a disclaimer that the posts are the individual

users’ opinions and not necessarily those of l

the site’s creators.
Mooberry said that given the inclusion of
anonymous posting on-the site, the team has

considered the possibility of grudge rep'ort— -

ing, or users using the site to defame personal
enemies. _ ' ' _
Butjohari explained that users will log into
the site through their Facebook accounts, en-
suring that each user can only create one ac-
count on Corrupt or Not. Therefore, if multiple
users name the same ofﬁcial in their posts, this
will provide a strong indication that the official

' is corrupt.

Fostering social change-

Vinayak said that he has wanted to do some-
thing about the pervasive corruption in Indian
society ever since he was a child. _

But Vinayak’s idea for the site really solidi-
ﬁed late last December_ after he watched an
animated video produced by the London-based
Royal Society for the Encouragement of Arts,
Manufactures and Commerce. ,

In the video, the well—known linguist Steven
Pinker discusses the role of innuendo in social
communication. At one point in the video, Pink-

er says that even though all the citizens within
a country might despise a dictator, individuals
will not act unless they know their compatriots

also hatethe dictator. But once they learn that
other citizens share their discontent, they begin
to act together against the oppressive regime.

_ Vinayak said‘ he wanted to apply this same
process to create social change, namely to ﬁght
microcorruption.

“We’re just providingaplatforrn where [us-
ers] can talk about these things that are hap-
pening in our society,”_]ohari said.

' As he developed his idea, Vinayak corre-
sponded over email with _]effrey Klink, who
teaches a course at Katz Graduate School of
Business. Klink’s course, which Vinayak took
inthe fall of 2012, discusses what multinational
companies must do to comply with anti—bribery
laws. Klink is also the CEO of Klink and Co., a
consultingﬁrm that assists companies in com-
plying with anti-corruption laws and assists
with internal fraud investigations.

Vinayak and his team met with Klink in

person on April'1, two days before the ﬁnal ‘

round of the Big Idea Competition.
Klink, who admitted that he was not familiar
enough with Indian laws to give the team legal
advice, recommended that the team speak with
legal ‘experts who could help them ensure that
they complied with the country’s libel laws,
and who could apply the laws to the project’s
intricacies, which include the fact that the team
' will host the site from outside India’s borders.
“In terms of what [Vinayak and his team}-‘do,
they ought to be very careful,” he said. ' .
Klink, whoearned both his undergraduate
degreeand his juris doctorate degree from-Pitt,
worked on corruption cases both as an assistant

‘ U.S. attorney in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh

' between 1989'and 1996 and after he founded
Klink and Co. in 2001. I
He said that corruption is often a question

of individuals acting amorally or opportunis-
tically, rather than immorally or maliciously.
When corruption is pervasive in a society, like
India’s, bribery becomes anormal prerequisite
for conducting business. Klink said that both

  

the individual paying a bribe and the individual
soliciting one stand to gain in the transaction.

Implementation _
The team intends to use the prize money
from the Big Idea Competition to develop its
website design and to pay for legal advice in
order to ensure that they comply with the laws.
Though the team has created mockups of how
the site will look, it has yet to produce a com-
plete design. ﬂ _ * ' .
Initially, contacts in Bombaywilltest the site
for the team.]ohari said that because many of
‘ these individuals workinthe technology indus-
try, they will be “ideal” for identifying glitches
with the site. Once the team ﬁxes these initial
glitches, its hope is to expand the network of

site users to include more people in Bombay and I

keep their expansion rate at a manageable pace. -

site to include other developing countries that
struggle with corruption. But they said that
privacy and libel laws differ from country to
country, and therefore they will have to seek

' advice from experts prior to expanding across
eaclfnew set of borders. .

-While Klink said that the obstacles facing
Vinayak and his team are formidable, he hopes
that they will succeed. He said that corrup-
tion has dramatically slowed India’s economic
growth in recent years, impacting the country

The race for the Democratic nomination for
the mayor of Pittsburgh is going to occur
this spring after ﬁnals are over and we have
all departed. Students of the University of
Pittsburgh, we must vote in this election.

» . Politicians ‘respond to messages at the

polls, and those who engage in the process of
decision—making are more likely to receive
favorable decisions. In the 2009 Democratic
primary that Mayor Luke Ravenstahl won,
there were only 23 ballots cast in the 8th
District of the 4th Ward, which consists of
the Schenley Quad and Litchﬁeld Towers.

It'is important to note that the Demo-
cratic candidate for mayor of Pittsburgh
almost always wins, so the primary in May
is typically more important than the general
election in November.

If students aren’t voting, elected ofﬁcials
have no incentive to consider their interests.
This very lack of incentives to care about
the interests of students, universities and
medical centers, all of which don’t vote,
allowed Ravenstahl to propose a tuition tax
in 2009. City Councilman Ricky Burgess, a
supporter of Ravenstahl, said to the Pitts-
burgh Post-Gazette, “[The tuition tax] will
solely be on the backs of the educational and

medical communities who are unwilling to
share their great wealth with the city in its
time of need.” 7

This demonization of universities and .

medical communities demonstrates the
total lack of political power that either one
wields.

This kind of blatant disregard for the
issues, voices and best interests of students
in the city of Pittsburgh should not be con-
doned, and the best ‘ '
way to ensure that
politicians never for— ’
get that students are
voters, too, is to cast
aballot. ’ ‘

To this end, voter ‘

Though voting, in and of itself (in this
case), will help to promote the interests of

voting for an unworthy candidate. There
are four candidates running in the race this
year. Bill Peduto stands out as by far the best.

steps: Most importantly, go out and vote on

ic primary with 26,880 total votes. There

strapped universities.

In the debate on our campus sponsored
by campus radio station WPTS-FM and
student publication Pitt Political Review, 
there was one general pattern for candi-
date responses to questions: Candidates
Jake Wheatley and Jack Wagner agreed on
a reasonable, smart course of action. Next,

vote for Peduto in the May election

Peduto emphatically proclaimed that he had
already made that proposal and been reject-
ed by city council or vetoed by Ravenstahl.

In response to a student question about
bike lanes, Wheatley and Wagner agreed
that we need improved running and bike
trails through our parks so that people can
improve their health and enjoy the out-
doors. What they fail to understand is that
every day in Oakland, students are incon-
venienced" by bikers irresponsibly riding
down sidewalks and ‘student bikers are hit
by vehicles. Peduto, however, proposed
implementing a comprehensive transfor-
mation of Pittsburgh’s road ‘infrastructure.
In particular, he wants to see more roads

include lanes for bikers, bystanders and .

vehicles in an effort to cbmbat dangerous
sidewalks and risky streets. *
Finally, while all candidates talked ab-
stractly about improving building codes
and increasing enforéement mechanisms
around the city, Peduto called out absen-
tee landlords in Oakland and elsewhere in
addition to specifying a plan to create an
executive responsible for housing codes.
All this is to say two simple things:
‘-Registered Democrats should make sure
they vote- in the primary. And make sure.

The first time I heard Drake’s
“Find Your Love,” I was 17 and
my girlfriend had just- dumped
me. I’m unashamed to say I had
more than a few moments sing-
ing along to it in my car, reveling
at lines like “I’m more thanjust
an option.”

Part of the reason I’m un-
ashamed —— aside from my ob-

viously inflated ego —— is that ‘

Drake himself made the track,
and he’s known for his many’
relationships with women,so
being a little sensitive can’t be
bad, right?

Rap music unfairly gets a rep-
utation as the oversexed male
ethos laced over nice drum pat-
terns. Whereas in other genres
men are ostensibly free to bear
their tender hearts, rappers have
to live up to some mythologi-
cal standard where everyone is
a Don Juan or something. Of
course, it doesn’t help when one
of the top rap singles this year is
a song thatprojects the message
that having a lot of sex is a man’s
main problem.

But there have been vision-
aries. I A

I’m going to go out on a limb
here and reveal that I strongly
believe 808$ 29’ Heartbreak: will
‘go down as Kanye West’s great-
est album. Ifyou haven’t had at
least one bedroom sing-along to
“Heartless,” you’re just that —

-heartless. But more importantly,

it was one of the most vulner-

ablemoments in any artist’s ca— _

reer, and Kanye was the arbiter.
808.: @’ Heartbreak was like the
documentary you’d watch about

‘Kanye after he dies (though he

obviously can’t) full of intimate

journal entries_about the darkest
points in his‘ life. And there he
was putting it out himself.

There are plenty who ar— '

gued that this album was pure
egotism, and that is possible.
But the implications of that re-
cord reverberate in every “Find

. Your Love”-style song that has

been subsequently‘ released. In
a lot of ways West made it okay
to be soft. He was at a point in
his career where everything
he touched turned into gold,
so even though the album was
a little off—putting for those
who’d rather believe that rap-
pers aren’t human, its worth was
undeniable. ,

Of course, like most things
West does, it took some time for
the emotion to_ catch on in the

rap industry.
' Leading up to the release of” '
his damned good. third album_,’_
ll’/of/f Tyler, The Creator released .,
the heart-wrenching video for
the single “IFH‘Y.’?gIn the video,-V
we find Tyler in afdollhouse with___-

a now—estranged lover.

“Girl you f*ckin’ with my
emotions,” he declaresin the
first verse.

The vulnerability in the song
is borderline uncomfortable,
partly because, as ‘a -society,
we’re not too accustomed to
seeing men in such positions,
and —— I’m going out on another
limb here -— especially not black
men.

In an interview with GQ,
Frank Ocean speaks to a sort

' of discomfort with the topic of

homosexuality in black music.
‘_‘In black music, we’ve got so
marly leaps and bounds to make
with acceptance and tolerance in
regard to that issue. It reflects
something just ingrained, you
know,” he said. '

Rappers break from lyrical mold to emote through songs,

He started from the bottom but now he’s onstage. MCT Campus

Almost like a defense from

being perceived as gay, rappers
— who I think its fair to admit
are predominantly black -
would compensate with sexually

' explicit and emotionless lyrics.
Thankfully, sensitive boys
who grew up on Weezer and
Radiohead are infusing the rap
"game with much-needed lyri-
cal diversity. West did it first,
which is probably why he made
his homepage a stream of Tyler’s
video for some time following its

release'— the real recognizing.

the real. . -

It might also be why he lent
Drake the beat for “Find Your
Love.” Drake is probably the best
at challenging rap’s conventions
of masculinity, frequently bear-
ing his soul on tracks that are
undeniably good, although itcan
be embarrassing to admit that.

“Marvin’s Room” quite mas-
terfully wraps the sappy lost-
love sentiment in a package that
could make the most seasoned
trap lord tear up a little.

‘-‘The woman that I would try,

 

is happy with a good guy,” he
croons. We feel you, Drake. '

Rap continues to become l

more democratic, and the gen-

‘ der stereotypes of the genre

might be the next wall to come
down. We’ve already got a num-
ber of legitimate female emcees
and the I_nternet is hollowing
out a spot for anyone to flourish
in the.genre, so there seems to

' be aforeseeable future in which

the male rappers will be a little

Pitt softball turned -its momentum
around this weekend by winning
two out of three games .against the

Seton Hall Pirates at Essex County

Mike Sheppard Sr.~ Field. Although
Pitt took two out of three, all three
games were highly contested, as one
run decided each. '  '

Pitt (16-22, 5-7 Big East) entered
the weekend on an eight-game los-

ing streak, but the Panthersiwin . .

Holly Aprile sees the wins over the

Pirates (14-21, 2-9 Big East) as cru- "

cial steps toward making further
strides in the Big East standings.

For what may be my ﬁnal column
ever as a member of The Pitt News’
staff, I decided I’d give a big thank
you to all my readers by trying to
answer any questions you felt the
desire to ask. I’ve enjoyed my time
-tremendously as a sports columnist
for The Pitt News, and I hope this
is a worthy exit. Thank you all for
reading over the last three years.

Here is some advice: If you

want a National Championship,
ﬁnd a new university to root for. If
it happens in your lifetime, it won’t
be for football and you’ll probably
be on a soft-foods—only diet wh_ile
your grandchildren run around the
family room with hologram-project-
ing cell phones. Seriously though,
basketball is our only chance,_and
that news is about as discouraging
as any after the last few years in the
NCAA tournament. Men’s basket-
ball head coach Jamie Dixon has a
contract through the‘2o22 season
(gasp) which offers someillusion
of stability and success, but to me
that just means nine more years of

there is a general agreement upon
replay’s value; the question is where

replay because the sport is ofﬁci-

and the NFL uses replay constantly

PECYNA’S POINTS

Gerrit Cole is one of many promising prospects in the Pirates’ organization. MCT ampus

Tyler Pecyna ’
Staff Writer

Sunday was a thrilling day for Pirates fans.

Nevermind the display of power with
which Pittsburgh stunned last year’s division-
winning Cincinnati Reds and parlayed into
an improbable, come-from—behind victory
after facing a 5-0 deﬁcit in the ﬁfth inning.

The real show came in Asheville, N .C.

In the weird world ofminor—league base-
ball, the Tourists (of Asheville) played host
to the Pirates’ single-A afliliate, the West
Virginia Power, who were 12-7 winners.

More encouraging than the victory is that '
Stetson Allie continued his torrid hitting for
the Power. A . '

Despite his incredible speed on the
mound, Allie, the second-round pick in the
2010 draft, ﬂamed out as a pitcher early in
2012 after displaying horriﬁc control. He
has since transitioned to a full—time ﬁrst
baseman — a move thatwas made after the
right-hander issued 37 walks and hit 10 bat-
ters in just less than 27 professional innings.

Allie raised his batting average to a ro-
bust .396 after going 3-for-3 with a walk on

' 0*‘ Sunday. He has also shown ample power this

season, evidenced by his ﬁve home runs and
three doubles in 11 games.

, But at 22, the fbrmer Ohio high-schooler
is no longer young for the competition at this «
level and needs to advance quickly to make a

M future impact in the major leagues.

Even if the organization and itsfans
should temper expectations for Allie, it’s a
pleasant surprise — and a glimmer of hope.
-- that the Pirates might get anything out

Cole, A||ie_,Tail|ngive hope fr future 

of the $2.25 million bonus paid to lure him
awayifrom the University of North Carolina.

There are safer bets in- the Pirates’ minor-
league system, but Allie is one of many who
could prove to be worth more attention than
the big-league ball club in 2013.

‘ So should the Pirates fall out of contention
before the summerfades to fall, there are still
meaningful late-season performances to be
aware of in the organization —— even some
that could occurin Pittsburgh.

For starters —— speciﬁcally, starting pitch-
ing — look at the guy drafted in the same year
as Allie, one round earlier: Jameson Taillon.

The word “projectable” is thrown around
baseball quite frequently — used to describe
a tall, lanky pitcher who could bulk up, tweak
mechanics and add a few miles per hour to
his fastball velocity — but Taillon actually
ﬁts the mold perfectly.‘

The 21-year-old right-handed pitcher

stands at a towering 6—fo’ot-6, weighs 235 I

pounds and sits in the mid— to upper 90s
with his fastball. Taillon, drafted second
overall in 2010, has justiﬁed the billing of
a “projectable” pitcher, striking out batters
at an above—average clip while limiting the
number of-free passes allowed.

So far this season, the Texas prep product

has pitched masterfully at double-A Altoona ,

for a guy barely over the legal drinking age.
In fact, Tai1lon’s success displays the polish
he had when he was drafted and ﬁirthermore
highlights Allie’s past struggles.

While Taillon certainly ﬂashes ace poten-
tial not seen in Pittsburgh since Doug Drabek
in the ’90s, he won’t fully establish himself
for another couple of years.

 

“The Pirates have been wisely conserva-
tive with Taillon throughout -his career, so
it’s unlikely that he will serve as more than a
bench ﬁxture in September after the minor-
league season has concluded. '

 Gerrit Cole, on the other hand, has been

A Pittsburgh—bound since spring training.

The first overall-selection in the 2011
draft, Cole was sent to triple—A Indianapolis

in mid—March primarily to reﬁne parts of his .

game — mostly the command of his high-
90s fastball. In the meantime, the demotion
will delay his major-league service time and
arbitration clock. This tactic is commonly
employed by teams to squeeze an extra year
out of a promising prospect before he be-

comes arbitration eligible and eventually.

free-agent eligible. ,

Cole, like Taillon, has a large frame that
tends to be indicative of a workhorse pitcher
———' a guy who can easily reach the heralded
200-inning mark annually across 30 starts.

If the UCLA product signiﬁcantly regress-
es at a higher minor-league level or suffers
a serious injuryor management is horribly
off-base with player development, Cole will
not be in Pittsburgh this summer.

In other words, something will have to
go terribly wrong to stop the power right-
hander’s debut in 2013. _

The Pirates could ﬁnally break that multi-
decade sub-.500 streak in 2013, but there is
a slim chance they can outlast Cincinnati or

, St. Louis for the duration of a season. And if

.Pittsburgh does somehow win the National
League Central Division, it does not have the

strong. Braun hasn’t been nearly as polarizing
as many of the other accused cheaters in his
sport. Maybe it’s:because he’s just a regular-
looking Caucasian with little to no eccentricity.
Perhaps it is that he plays in a small market up
in Milwaukee. Maybe he is just a really good
baseball player who has had some terrible luck
in being associated with performance enhanc-
ing drugs. Maybe he is innocent. Probably not,
but maybe.

What is it about sports that no matter how
messed up the larger world, the economy,
the ecology, social order and social justice

’ .—— no matter what -—-— it seems like people

are totally willing to turn their attention
and energy and time and focus to, well,
sports? -
- Rebecca from Eugene, Ore. -

Sports are one of the few things .left in this
world that transcend cultures and nations.
While their “signiﬁcance” is often questioned,

. the truth remains that competition is one of
the most innate human desires. We all want to '

be winners, and we all want to be cheering for
winners ifwe can’t win ourselves. Since ancient
times, whensport wasconsidered a gladiator
against a pack of lions, humans have always
been thirsty to see how far our most coveted
beings could push themselves. Now, instead
of some Russell Crowe—esque gladiator, we
cheer for the strongest and the fastest, those‘

' who can jump the highest and hit the hardest.

Sports don’t act as a_ substitute for the economy,
ecology, social order or social justice; they act
as a‘ remedy for it. From personal experience I
can_ tell you that after a hard day at a low-wage
job, there are few things better thancoming
home to grab a beer and watch Tiger Woods

1 prowl the green or LeBron]ames take over in

the fourth,quarter. Sports are an escape the
same way a good book is, except these mythi-
cal characters are so real that we can dream
about meeting them or even defeating them.

If you could be any piece of sports equip-
rnent what would you be and why?
- Becca from Pittsburgh, Pa.

I’m not sure how you can call yourself a
friend of mine without knowing the answer
to this question before you submitted it. I’d be
a Frisbee, of course’. They can ﬂy, you know?

A Frisbee is the only instrument of play that . ,
can leave the boundaries of the ﬁeld and then ’

ﬂoat back into the arms of a waiting receiver.

A A Frisbee can roll, bounce, skip, spin, dive, ﬂip

and hover. It can be used as a plate and it can
be thrown inverted. You can open a beer with
a Frisbee and it can cover your head during a
rainstorm (it’s waterproof). With a nice tail
wind, it can be thrown more than 100 yards.
It ﬁts easily in a shoe_bag and can be hidden
under a driver’s seat. You can take it anywhere.

more than $10 unless you’re getting ripped

beaches of the globe. So yeah, I’d be a Frisbee

Who will come out [as gay] ﬁrst in the
“big-three” sports (American sports, so
not hockey or soccer) and will he or she
come out alone orwith a group? And when?
- Bailey from Pennington, NJ.

This is a tough question with little opportu-
nity for logic or reason. What sport it will hap-
pen in is based largelyon which athlete ﬁnds
the will ahd bravery to lead the way. Basketball
is dominated by a culture of independent, “I”
in “team” talent. Of the three major American

.team sports (football, basketball, baseball),
basketball seems the least likely for a player
to come out. There are too many egos and
too few people in the locker room to bank on
supporting you. While baseball offers some
relief from this, it'is still a sport whose most
dedicated fan base seems to be dominated
by a rural and conservative demographic. Of
the three, football has begun to receive the
most public support from its players. NFL
spokesman GregAiello says the league’s rookie
symposiums will include sessions on inclusion
and tolerance. NFL senior vice president of
player engagement and my former neighbor,
Troy Vincent, met with three organizations
representing the LGBT community last week
and the league as awhole seems to be prepar-
ing for a player to come out sometime in the
near future. I have no idea who, but I think
it will be the NFL and I think it will happen
before 2014. Here’s to hoping

ment of his brand, a publicly stated agenda
byjames, going to lead him to A bigger mar-
ket such as Los Angeles or New York? If you
are in.his shoes, where do you go?

- Aaron from Pittsburgh, Pa.

 At this point, it seems pretty much inevi-
table thatjames will leave Miami. Along with
your analysis of Wade and Bosh, the new col-
lective bargaining agreement and LeBron’s
ability to terminate his contract" make his
exit a near certainty. Cleveland isn’t just a
heartwarming option, but also a realistic one.
The Cavaliershave the cap space to do it and
have an appealing young stud forjames to
play with in Kyrie Irving. Irving andjames are

_ good friends and would be even better team-

mates, Playing for the Lakers in Los Angeles is
a compelling possibility; the Buss family has
proved their willingness to cram as many stars
intothe Staples Center as possible and Kobe
Bryant could be out of the league by the time
LeBron has to choose where to go. New York
is aplace James has always wanted to play,
but the Knicks are the only option (Brook-
lyni has one of the worst cap predicaments
in the league). We all know how he does with
the lights on at Madison Square Garden, but
New York would have to ﬁnd a team they can
dump Amar’e Stoudemire’s contract on —
noffan easy task: Nobody isftalking about the

' Bulls, one of the few teams that made a play

on LeBron three seasons ago that still has the
cards to get him. Chicago isn’t far fromjames’
home and it is a city that — traditionally —
athletes like playing in. If LeBron ever wants
to challenge the Michaeljordan comparisons
head‘ on, going to the Bulls would be a good
way‘ to do it. Quietly, a team like San Anto-
nio could also snatch LeBron. They have cap
room, a tradition of winning, aging stars on
their way out and arguably the N BA’_s best and
most-liked head coach in Gregg Popovi_ch.,If I
werejames, I would sign a small commitment
to a team like the Lakers or the Bulls and try
to make another move in 2017. I think more
impressive than Jordan’s modem-era feat
(sandwiching six titles in Chicago around two

years of retirement) would be winning one or 4
' two championships forthree or four different
teams. Ifjames is ever going to head back to 1

Cleveland and truly wants to make amends
with his old city, he should do it on the tail
end of his career and retire there.

. Can youncry underwater? Why did my mom
refuse to buy me a Furby? What is fancy,

ketchup and why is it fancy?
— Tegan from Pittsburgh, Pa.

Yes, butI suppose the tears would be hard
to see. Your mom’s parental guidance is well
founded: There is nothing. creepier than a
Furby. As for ketchup, you live in Pittsburgh -

. there is only one true ketchup — Heinz or die.

After the performance of all rookie QBs
last year, do you still believe RG3 is the best
of the class?

— Mike from Pittsburgh, Pa.

You’re a man who seems like he’s trying
to bait me into making a fool out of myself
by playing fanboy for my favorite team’s
quarterback, but I’ll take the bait. Yes, I do
believe RG3 is the best of the class. Don’t for-
get that he was up 14-0 in the ﬁrst quarter of
the divisional playoff round against one of
the best defenses in the league after helping
his team win seven straight games after the
bye week (six, if you don’t count the one Kirk

Cousins played for him against Cleveland, I

which I suppose you shouldn’t). I mean, the
Seahawks ate everyone up at the end of last
season and he had two touchdown drives on
two chances against them with one leg. If they
won that game or went into the playoffs with
RG3 healthy, I think they wouldhave been
in a battle in the NFC Championship game’
(despite having a pathetic defense).Regard-
less, he had the third—best passer rating in
the league (behind Aaron Rodgers and Pey-
ton Manning) and was one-half of the best
quarterback—running back rushing combina-

tion in NFL history. He’s bigger, stronger and.

more athletic than Russell Wilson and almost
as smart as Andrew Luck. If I’m playing in one
game, I’m taking RG3 because I do believe he
is the “best” of the class. If you asked me who
was the best quarterback to build a franchise
around, I think there is a strong argument for
Luck. However, that argument would be based
almost entirely on the idea that RG3 “can’t stay
healthy” or “doesn’t know how to slide” in the
NFL. The truth-is that nobody can judge him
on whether he has learned or not until we see
him step on the ﬁeld again in the 2013-2014
season (which, by the way, Ithink he will do in.
week one). Until then, I can’t ﬁnd a bad thing
to say about the guy.

with a two—run home run to close the gap to

5-2. In the top half of the following inning, Pitt

broke the game wide open when Balatgek,
King and Nirschl all scored to widen the Pitt
lead to 8-2.

Despite the large deﬁcit, the Pirates didn’t
stop ﬁghting. Seton Hall scored three runs in
the bottom of the ﬁfth inning and twoin the
bottom of the seventh, but the comeback bid
fell just short. Thanks to the pitching efforts
of King, the Pirates never took the lead as the
Panthers held on for the 8-7 victory.

“Everyone knew we could win —_ and
should win,” King said. _

The Panthers don’t have much recovery
time, as they play a set of mid-,we_ek games at

42..

Louisville this Wednesday. Pitt returns ‘home -«at

this weekend to begin a ﬁve—game homestand.
The Panthers will match up against the second-
place Notre Dame Fighting Irish in a critical
Big East series as Pitt continues its climb out
of thebottom half of the Big East standings. I
