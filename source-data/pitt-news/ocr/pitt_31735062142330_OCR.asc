The Cathedral Air Raid De-
fense Organization wishes to
compliment the student body on
its performance in the air raid

» drill of October 14 and td thank
, the student body sincerely for
A its fine spirit of. cooperation.

Although all the reports on the
air raid drill are not as yet in, Dr.
John J. Geise, associate professor

‘of history and chief air raid ward-

en of the Cathedral, said that he
was sure that it was by far the
‘most successful drill that we have
had to date.

Last week’s raid was the ﬁrst
in which the ﬁre watchers for Zone
4 operated from their post on the

‘ roof of the Cathedral.

Although no noticeable ﬂaws
were discovered in the University
air raid protection system, a few
slight innovations are being put

into effect.

In the interest of increased ef-

7 ﬁciency, the bottom eight floors

of the Cathedral, that is the base-
ment, the ground ﬂoor, and ﬂoors
one to six, have been organized
into a single unit, called group
A. These eight ﬂoors are under
the personal direction of Dr.
Peter Gray, associate professor
of biology. Dr. Gray has under
’ him three senior wardens, each
of whom is responsible for two
‘or three ﬂoors. .
The new senior wardens are:
Miss Lorena A. Garlock, chief of

’ the reference department of the
A University library, who has charge

of ﬂoors four, ﬁve, and six; Dr. J.

. Ellwood Amos, assistant professor

of finance, who is in charge of
ﬂoors, one, two, and three; and
Dr. John Carroll Amundson, as-
sistant professor of history, who is
the director of the ground floor and
the basement levels.

These wardens are responsible
directly .to Dr. Gray for traffic
movement, blackout, and general
Safety. Each senior warden has un-
der him a floor captain for each
ﬂoor.

In addition to, these people Dr.
Gray is organizing a corps -of
messengers, a corps of stair war-
dens, a corps of door wardens,
a corps of shelter wardens, and
a number of ﬁrst aid teams. The

4 members of all of these units are
selected from the student body.

Volunteers for any of these last

services should get in touch with

Dr. Gray or with Dr. Geise.

Experimentation has lead to the
development of a new evacuation
plan for evening classes, whereby
all occupants of the Cathedral will
be concentrated on the fourth ﬂoor
and in the basement ‘gymnasium.
:’Al1 windows in these two _ areas
have been blacked out, making it
possible to keep all shelters light-
ed during an alert. .

 PTM tol Exhibit \War Films

Cl Present-Day England

Presenting its second program for the year, Pitt Town
meeting will exhibit an ofﬁcial British ﬁlm, “The Warning,”
today at 2:30 o’clock in 324 Cathedral, announces Hal Gon-

delman, C43, publicity chairman.

According to Gondelman, the ﬁlm
reveals the actual bombing scenes
in the Battle for Britain showing
both the civilian and military de-
fense against the invaders. High-
lights include scenes .of the British
people ﬁghting off the terriﬁc
bombing of London and pictures of
the air _combat between British
Spitﬁres and German ﬁghters.

“Of vital importance to all of
us,” said Gondelman, are the
methods of civilian defense em-
ployed by the British people in .
successfully warding of the Ger-
man airmen.” Film ﬂashes of
London before and after the bom-
bardment demonstrate the eﬂ’ec-
tive destruction resulting in to-
tal war, and reveal the sacriﬁces
that must be met by the civilian
population. ’

Dr. John Geise and Dr. Peter
Gray of the University Civilian

Defense have largely been respon-

sible in obtaining the ﬁlm for a
showing at Pitt Town meeting. The
ﬁlm is equipped with a sound track
and will be narrated in the fashion
of March of Time.

Fraternity Men
Observe Annual
Silence Week

Fraternity men are passing
through a nine day period of
silence, while their freshman rush-
ees ponder upon the fraternity of
their choice. Since 2:00 o’clock
Sunday morning, at the conclusion
of the ﬁve day rushing period, fra-
ternity men have not been allow-
ed to contact any freshman con-
cerning fraternity matters. This
period of silence is designed to give
the freshmen ample time to con-
sider the worth of the various fra-
ternities which have been enter-
staining them for the past ﬁve days.

All bids or invitations to join
‘fraternities will be issued
through the office of the dean of
men. Fraternities submitted seal-
ed bids yesterday for those men
which they wish to pledge.

Interviews will be carried out‘
during the week with these men to
issue the bids. ‘

Freshmen are permitted to con-
verse,-of course, with the frater-
nity me‘n, however, they are not al-
lowed to ‘discuss fraternity mat-
ters with any fraternity member
or pledge. Also, they are not to
reveal to anyone, including their
fellow freshmen, their choice of
fraternities.

“The reason for Silence Week is
to give each boy a period during
which he can make up his mind
on what he wants to do,” said T.
W. Biddle. dean of men. He_added,
“Boys who have made their de-
cision should keep it a secret in
the interest of those who have not.”

Gov't Releases
Rationing Plans

From state gas rationing ofﬁcer
W. M. Griest, comes the following
information that may be of inter-
est to the students of the Univer-
sity:

According to state gas ration-
ing regulations, college students
who travel back and forth to school
are eligible for allowances of oc-
cupational mileage. This is depend-
ent upon the fact that the student‘,
must show a lack of other adequate
means of transportation. He must
also prove that he is meeting the
requirement with respect to ride-
sharing arrangements. V

The rationing oflice also states
that no rationing board may grant
occupational mileage in excess of
an average of 470 miles per month
for travel of a student to and from
school. It is hoped that this recog-
nition will aid in the student's at-
tendance at college.

Two Thousandl'35', 

Stickers lssued

Two thousand red, white and 

blue stickers from the Pittsburgh

Motor Club-Pittsburgh Press joint- .

ly sponsored campaign for a35-
mile perhour speed limit have been
distributed to the students of the

University. Arthur H. Thompson,

C43, the President of Men's Coun-
cil, was the Pitt representative of
the 35 Club. After 1,600 stickers
had been passed out Friday and

400 Monday to the enthusiastic-

student body, the entire stock on
hand was consumed.

While discussing the eager tac-
tics, Thompson commented, “It

was indeed encouraging to note .

the willingness and enthusiasm of
the students in supporting this
campaign.”

After the two thousand labels
had gone, Thompson contacted the,
Motor Club in a futile effort to ob-
tain more, but all of the club's
45,000 stickers had gone almost as
fast as they had here on the cam-
pus. Various civic clubs, labor
unions, and local organizations had
consumed the second shipment
since the start of the drive.

Men’s Lounge
Not Used Enough

The Men's Lounge, sponsored by
Men's council, is there to provide
relaxation for men students. In it
you will ﬁnd all the latest maga-
zines, the daily papers—and soft
chairs. Checkers and chess tables
are there too, just itching to be
used. And for those fellows who
enjoy standing around a piano and,

blasting away with all the power l» 
in their voices, the lounge has a  .

piano.
“We have these facilities for
the beneﬁt of you male students,
and we want you to use them,"

said Art Thompson, C43, presi- .

dent of the Men's council. “In
addition to what the lounge now
has, ping-pong tables will soon
be added——we hope.” _

As one of our pro'f-essors pointed out the other
day, the recent full page Pittsburgh Press reprint

, of the editorial in Satevepost—“Neo-Liberal Illu-

sion: That Collectivism is Liberty,” is more than
_just an editorial.

It’s the opening gun of the post war barrage of
reaction that’s going to»be levelled against all the
social gains that we’ve made because of, and con-
current with, the war.

And in it the “big” boys are saying to the com-
mon pople of this country that after the war we
are going back to all the evils of an economic sys-
tem that’s been in collapse for the last twenty
years—a system that thrived on nationalism, im-
perialism, race and religious prejudice, a system
based on the crushing of labor unions, a death-

"struggle competitive system.

§

The editorial gives lie to all the statements of
President Roosevelt, Vice President Wallace, and
Supreme Court Justice Robert Jackson that we are
on the threshold of a “people’s, century.”

And as such it serves to destroy the unity that
has been welded among the peoples of this country
-—a unity based on a belief in the era of the com-
mon man, a solidarity that was strengthened by
such things as:

‘ .  J...‘ ‘-

trial plants, where workers in defense industries
were sorely needed.

2. The government’s increased curbing of the
excesses of big business--the Truman reports,
gross salary ceilings, the exposing and ﬁning of
Standard Oil, for their cartel with German owned
Farbenindustrie, to mention a few examples.

3. The passage of the Anti-Poll tax bill in the
house, along with the defeat of Negro-baiter Eu-
gene Talmadge.

4. The latest plan from Washington to have col-
lege admissions determined by some plan similar
to civil service, so that the best, rather than the
richest, high school*gr2;duites*will go to college.

 

And the Post editorial, because it says that after
the war we are going back to a system which had

to be scrapped before we could produce enough to"

ﬁght an effective war, is the ﬁrst enemy attack in
the “home front” ﬁght against Fascism.

It’s not our intention here to show the fallacies
of the editorial itself. We did that in the last issue
of the News. Kenneth Crawford and his colleagues
did it far better in last Thursday’s PM.

But what we’d like to point out is that now the
two-front ﬁght for progressive democracy is really

Marines ﬁght at Guadalcanal, that the Russians
ﬁght at Stalingrad, that our Army ﬁghts on the
Aleutians, have landed a paralyzing blow right in -

Because a lot of us are ﬁghting or will soon be .
ﬁghting mainly so that we won’t have to go back
to the system championed by the Saturday even-
ing Post and lose all that we’ve gained so far.
We don’t like the idea of ﬁghting for the boys who
dictate the policy of the Post, and who say they
believe that most of the people in this country are ‘
blockheads, numbskulls, hangers on the coat tails
of a few industrialist geniuses.

We once read something like what that editorial
said. The author declared that the people were
stupid, incapable of determining themselves what
was best for their own national welfare, and needed

Editor, the Pitt News:

~ Being a college student does not
exempt one from respectrfor the
ﬂag of our country, and the fact
that "a student is not in uniform
does not mean that he should not
exhibit that courtesy to the flag
which he has been taught and well
knows.

‘R.O.T.C. parades on the cam-
pus have shown that both men

. and women students have forgot-

ten, temporarily, that no one re-
mains seated while the ﬂag goes

‘ by, that no one stands with hat

on when the colors are passing.

A-s educated young men and
women we should be leaders in the
matter of both the outward forms
and the soul of democracy. We
should set the example for others
who perhaps do not know how to
exhibit love and devotion and loy-

' alty to the American way through

deference to the flag.

As a group of representative
upperclass men, Gamma Circle
of Omicron Delta Kappa calls
upon all students to prove by
their actions that they know and
understand outward signs of loy-
alty, and that they call the at-
tention of others to the patriotic

value of such demonstration.

Students Lack
Study Habits"-

By ACP

Colleges accelerating their pro-
grams might do well to have their
men and women students study in
separate groups to avoid time-
wasting, in the opinion of Dr. F.
Kenneth Berrien of Colgate univer-
sity.

Dr. Berrien draws his conclu-
sion from a psychology depart-
ment report on “How Quickly Do
Students Start Studying?”, as
compared with a similar survey
conducted by D. C. Troth of the
University of Illinois. I

Studying the behavior of 100
students, 50 men and 50 women,
during the first ten minutes after
they had seated themselves in the
University of Illinois library read-
ing room, Mr. Troth learned they
spent 40 per cent of the time con-
versing, aimlessly leaﬁng books,
using vanity cases, writing or read-
ing letters, and just looking
around.” None of the 100 students,
he discovered, spent the entire te

' minutes in study. . »

of higher learning. The oﬁicial
newspaper of the University should
represent‘ the best thinking of the
students and news of all the vari-
ous student activities.

It seems to me that Pittpourri
is out of keeping with this basic
idea. It is the product of limited
thinking on the part of those who
read it, and in the light of the
limited space in the news, it is
a luxury that could be dispensed
with for the duration.

If there is a place for this col-
umn (some people read only Pitt-
pourri) it perhaps should be in-
cluded in the Panther. Perhaps the
fraternities and sororities could
collaborate on a weekly bulletin
entitled, “Who is Wearing Whose
Pin Today.”

These freshmen do get started in
a hurry. The other day in the Tuck
shop Dick Briney was deeply en-

Dick Fair and Marion Reichard
have a fairly steady Friday night
date, but on Saturday nights
Marion reserves her time for a
Techite. Thus when the PiKA
rushing dance was held last Sat-
urday, it was just the wrong
night for Dick, for he couldn’t
get the date and had to seek
elsewhere.

Here’s a case where boy doesn’t
want to meet girl or at least want
to date her. The two people in-
volved are ~Winnie Jarvis and
Bergie Stcytler. It seems
once Bergie had a slight disagree-
ment with a certain person who is
Principal of Peabody High and
ended up in Allderdice. That cer-
tain person is Winnie’s uncle.

When drill was called off Wed-

congregated outside of room 232
waiting for Lt. Finnerty to open
the locked door. At this very in-
opportune m o m e n t Rosemarie
Waltman, a freshman with bril-

In- a second she was surrounded by
a ten deep circle of curious and
questioning cadets. After excusing
herself she entered a vacant room
nearby and started to study but to
no avail. Soon the room was crowd-

presence of Lt. Finnerty and the
threat of demerits brought the
boys back to class and the war.

‘_“-;It wasn’t what Billy Hillenblrand or his teammates did

0 ‘Saturday afternoon on the Stadium sod, instead it was the
takes and eagerness of the Panther gridiron machine that
bed them for the third time this season.

 The Hoosier all-American lived up to his press notices,
jlis backﬁeld mates supported him ably, and the visitors’ line
, “ “Was adequate, but it was the locals’ own penalties that turned
i, the complexion of the contest from that of a closely-matched
*7‘), tiltito the near-ﬁasco that resulted.

__ ‘Pitt, again playing the contest with a wobbly, patched
ﬁineup and a mere 15 performers capable of playing varsity
fiball, held the once-defeated Indiana team to a 13-7 lead at half-
:;time. During this time neither team showed brilliant offenses,
‘;..a.nd neither showed an inpregnable defense.
 Indiana realized almost immediately that the front wall
of the Blue and Gold was not to be tampered with, and, as
-result, began throwing passes. Two of their long, fluffy
lﬁasses were caught for touchdowns. Pitt, likewise, did not de-
erv.e their score for it resulted on a play that comes, at the
E 0st, once in a season. There is no doubt that Bowser’s men
3
?

hadithe breaks during these ﬁrst two periods.

But with the second half came disaster. Disaster in form
of penalties. For everything that Pitt did and did not do they
were penalized. The Panthers opened up their bag of tricks
in,the third quarter, but were habitually set back in their

K; tracks by the oﬂicials, not the Hoosiers.

 ‘The turning point came when Saksa intercepted an enemy
ﬁpass on his own goal line and ran 18 yards before being stop-
_ ped. "The officials ruled holding on the play and Pitt had to

start all over again from the three-yard line. A few plays were

run, and much yardage gained. Then another 15 yard penalty.

With this second penalty, the spirit of the boys also suf-

‘ ‘ered a setback. Indiana got the ball, another long, ﬂuffy pass,

ind their ﬁnal tally. Pitt was ﬁnished. They wanted to win, to

«sure. But 15 tired, bruised men cannot be counted upon to

ore two touchdowns in one short period, and the 20,000 fans
ent home talking of the great decline of Pitt football.

,5 Still the squad did not look like the same bunch that
‘played 53 minutes of winning football against the highly-
 ‘touted Great Lakes team two weeks ago, nor the team that
 swamped the aerial circus from Southern Methodist. They

‘were expected to have a natural let-down this week, but with
few decent breaks from the officials, the local might have
at-cked up victory number two.

Next week the Bowsermenplay hostito the always dan-
’ erous Blue Devils from Durham, North Carolina. The Duke

   

   
  
  
   
  
  

; ennsylvania, and Ohio will be odds—on favorites over the
lightly tarnished Golden Panthers.

Being the underdogs in a football game is nothing new
. , to ‘the Pitt football team for not since last year’s Carnegie
ech contest has the locals been on top of the “Smart Money.”

The chances of the locals tucking away their second vic-
ry of the season at the expense of Duke this coming Sat-
' rday is ‘good. If their players recover from their bruises of
is week, and if they play thebrand of football that they are

quad once again loaded with “Southerners” from Western .

By JERRY RIPP

It will be two former gridiron
greats_that have sunken to inedi-
ocrity this week-end at the Stadium
when Pitt plays host to the Duke
Blue Devils. In former years this
would be the “game of the year,”
but this season it’s just another
contest between two so-so teams.

In four games played thus far
Duke has won two and lost two,
while the Panthers can show only
one triumph against three defeats.
When these two outﬁts were at
their peaks they would go through
an entire season without losing
more than two games collectively.

Duke was hit hard by graduation
and by players leaving school to
enter the armed services. Nine of
last season’s regulars graduated
including three-fourths of the ﬁrst
string backﬁeld. Add to this the
loss of Wallace Wade, one of the
nation’s best grid coaches now a
major.in the army, and it is easy
to see the reason for the collapse of
the Blue Devils.

From the team that beat Pitt last
season 27-7 only Leo Long and Tom
Davis relnain. Coach Eddie Cam-
eron has tried to mold a winning
combination from the reserves he
inherited from last season’s team
and from last year’s freshman
squad.

The Blue Devils opened the sea-
son by beating Davidson, but were
forced to put up a real ﬁght for
the game. Following this win they
were upset by Wake Forest and
then lost to the Georgia Navy
team. Last Saturday Duke scored
an upset of their own as they wal-
loped Colgate 34-0.

Coach Cameron has been using
two, former linemen in his ﬁrst
string backﬁeld. Tom Davis, former
guard, has been converted into a
quarterback and Jim Smith, who
held down one of the ends last sea-
son is in the blocking back post this
year.

Pitt has looked both good and
bad this season as they try to
weather another “suicide schedule.”
Against Minnesota they were beat-
en badly, but came back nobly the
following week to triumph over a
‘favored Southern Methodist team.
The Panthers nearly scored the
biggest upset of the year in their

game with Great Lakes. However,
the service team’s overwhelming
numbers and power were just too
much for the Blue and Gold. In los-
ing to the Gobs the Panthers looked
good to say the least.

Last Saturday they were over-
powered again as Indialia jumped
off a fast 13-0 lead and then coast-
ed in. The Bowsermen looked both
good and bad last Saturday as
they tried to overcome the lead of
the Hoosiers, but they just couldn’t
come through.

This Saturday the Panthers will
have another tough ﬁght on their
hands. Duke, by beating highly fav-
ored Colgate so decisively showed
that they have a better team than
their .500 record indicates. While
they aren’t the same Blue Devils
that won the Southern Con'ference
crown last season, they are a strong
enough outﬁt to "cause Pitt plenty
of trouble. ' ‘

The Panthers will probably be on

YVV Takes
Over Stamp
Sales Drive _

Hindered by poor sales
in their attempt to blacken
Hit1er’s face with war

' stamps, the stamp drive com-

mittee’ tomorrow puts into ef-
fect its plan to have regular
campus groups aid in the

1, sales.

The first campus sales group
will be the YWCA, breaking last
year’s tradition of using only wom-
en’s fraternities to help in selling
stamps and bonds. Public affairs
committee of YWCA headed by
Ruth Becker, Ed44, will meet to-
day to arrange ﬁnal plans for to-
morrow’s drive.

Last Wednesday’s sales total
was only $310.50, which co-chair-
man Dick Hartz, BA43, said was
“distinctly below the par which
we have set for this semester.”
Hartz promised a revision in sales
technique, but refused to shoul-
der all the blame for Wednesday's
discouraging . results.

_ “An appalling lack of enthusi-
asm and a lethargic disregard for
-the present war effort are more
than obvious among the student
body,” declared Hartz, who has
been campaigning rather futilely
among students and faculty fo-r the

, last two weeks.

Of last week’s total. stamp sales
accounted for $129.00, while bond
sales brought in $181.50. At pres-
ent the two week total has reached
$1,924.10. : V

The new booth which was used
last Wednesday for the first time
will be painted and decorated for
tomorrow’s sales if possible.

Business Conditions Are:

Business in the district ‘made
further gains last.week, according
to the Bureau of Business Re-
search. Steel mills in the district
continued to operate at near ca-

pacity levelspwith the supply of

steel scrap somewhat improved. A
slight decline in rail tonnage was
offset by a rise r in river traffic.
Pittsburgh department stores show-
a gain of 17 per cent over the
same week a year ago.

Dr. Gould H
For Shortage

If conditions do not improve soon schools willbe forced to do
with classes in several ﬁelds especially
tion, because of a shortage of teachers.

The problem could be met,
however, according to Dr. George
Gould, professor of education, in
his report on the School of Edu-
ca'tion’s Teachers Appointment
bureau.

“With the exception of vocation-
al education there is in all prob-
ability a sufficient number of ade-
quately prepared teachers avail-
able if the salaries of the schools
compared favorably with the in-
come offered by industry and busi-
ness,” Dr. Gould reported, adding
that the minimum salaries in Penn-
sylvania must be raised consider-
ably if many teaching positions are
not to go unﬁlled this fall.

The problem is a serious one.
Teachers in the ﬁeld of commercial
education in particular have left
their profession to take some of
the many high-paying positions in
industry open to experienced office
help. Out, of, the 15 students who
