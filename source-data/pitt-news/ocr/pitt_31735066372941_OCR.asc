Recently Named

By BARRY ZASLOFF

Take away the gaudy television
cameras, the flashing Minoltas and
the writer’s tablets, and Chancellor
Wesley W. Posvar’s Cathedral of
Learning office would have had a
busines.s_.—as.-usual apperance last
Thursday afternoon.

Flanking Posvar at the long con-
ference table was Dr. Jack Free-
man, senior administrative vice
chancellor, and Edward Bozik, the
assistant chancellor.

‘ But the topic of conversation was
not higher education or university
policies, rather, the announcing of
Bozik as the man to suceed Casimir
Myslinski as Pitt’s new athletic
director. F

Myslinski, who retired in April,
left behind a solid athletic pro-
gram, which was among the rea-
sons listed by Pitt officials for
Bozik’s selection, even though he
had not applied for the job.

“If our athletic department had
needed a shaking up, we might
have gone outside,” Freeman said.
“But we have an outstanding pro-
gram and Ed Bozik is the man who
can keep it strong.”

“I have mixed feelings,” Posvar
said of Bozik’s change in job titles.
“It_’s a personal and professional
loss to me.” .

He continued, “I’m charging Ed
with bringing non-varsity sports
up to the level of varsity, with
improving alumni support and
with keeping an eye on the best
interests of the student-athletes
who will be placed in careers.”

- One observer asked Posvar to
compare‘Bozik’s swapping of jobs
in army terms, which was slightly
inappropriate considering both

Posvar and Bozik are former Air

Force officers.

Director

“It’s like moving from Lieuten-
ant General to Admiral,” Posvar
answered.

Said Bozik, “I don’tconsider this
a lateral move—there’s a job to be
done. .

“At Notre Dame, they don't
recruit, they select. I would like for

us to be in a similar position,"

he emphasized.

I “Intercollegiate athletics are big
business and they need manage-
ment,” Bozik continued. “We have
to work at the public relations

image of our athletic department..

There have been academic com-
mercialism charges, but I’m afirm
believer that academics
athletic excellence can go hand-in-
handf’

An overriding question during.

the press conference was based on a
similar premise: Is Bozik, as Pos-
var’s right-hand man, qualified to
step from the academic walls of the
chancellor's office into the trophy-
strewn athletic department?

Pitt officials answered in the
affirmative, as evidenced by Free-
man's comment that 26 applicants
‘were rejected in favor of Bozik.

“We are members of the Associa- .

tion of American Universities,
which includes the best 50 institu-
tions in the country,” Freeman
added as an afterthought. “There
are strong academic-athletic ties-
Texas, Michigan, and Ohio State
are also members.

“Ed has served as the chancel-

lor’s deputy in charge of athletics;'

he reported directly to the athletic
department. If he had just been an
assistant chancellor, he would not
have been chosen as athletic direc-
tor, ” Freeman noted.

Posvar described Bozik as being
“extremely well qualified" and.
added that “he will bring a whole
new dimension to Pitt athletics.”

ognize black culture’s internal
structures. Also, studies have
become “interventionist,” that is,
created in the hope that the results
can benefit society, Denton said.

In reviewing past studies, Den-
ton said blacks go through various
stages of consciousness concerning
themselves, their families and their
place in society. Denton attributed
the basis of present-day stage classi-
ficatien to black psychologist
Charles Thomas. Thomas sepa-
rated the stages in five points along
a developmental continuum:

O Withdrawal—-at this point, the
black person is removed from black
culture. Withdrawal signifies a
high degree of dependency on the
status quo, which must be eradi-
cated before continuing to higher
stages;

0 Testifying—a transitional
stage wherein the individual
becomes aware of his place in
society. Denton said someone in
the testifying stage is going
through a personal change and it

0 Information processing—the
individual becomes aware at a
deeper level. This is apparent in
people who have a greater identifi-
cation with black and African
culture;

0 Activity——at this stage, the per-
son is active. He is participating in
the black struggle in either a mil-
itant or non-militant fashion;

0 Transcendental—the person
moves beyond barriers of black and
white.

In 1971, studies develped at Pitt
created a survey built along the
lines of Thomas's continuum.

This study, called “Develop-
mental Inventory of Black Con-
sciousness(DIBC), “categorized
blacks in four successive stages:
preconscious, confrontation,
internalization and integration.

Subjects were asked to grade
statements such as, “Is there too
much talk by blacks about white
racism?” on a one to 10 scale.

Progress was made with the
report, according to Denton, espe-
cially in learning of the activity-

, riskiest. Violence is almost one of

- more likely to have problems with

confrontation stage.

“One thing I’ve observed—the‘

confrontation is one_of the essen-
tial stages,, as well as one of the

the requisites.

“If an individual does not go
through with confrontation stage,
there will be deleterious conse-
quences,” Denton said.

But in 1976, Anita Brown, who
received her doctorate at- Pitt,
found a correlation between the
subjects on the far ends of the spec-
trum, preconscious and in-
tegration.

Denton is presently researching
the correlation between the two.
He said, however, an individual
who is psychologically naive, as is
a preconscious-withdrawal type, is

himself and society.

Such research may not ‘get the
full attention of the media, but
Denton said it will, in the words of
researcher Frank Terrell, “simul-
taneously elevate the consciousnes

and A

and pride of blacks.” M

could be, perhaps,.momentary;

Construction of Pitt's Graduate School of Business
building is almost ready to begin as these two men par-
ticipated in the ground-breaking ceremony last Thurs-
day afternoon at 4 behind Forbes Quadrangle.

Organized by business graduate students and facul-
ty, the ceremony was an “informal” one, according to
Dr. Josephine E. Olsen, a professor of business admin-

.istration at the school, “just so we have an excuse to
have a party.” Olsen pointed out that the “real”
ground-breaking ceremony will take place sometime in
September.

The business school is to be located on the corner of
Bouquet St. and Roberto Clemente Way—where the
old Forbes Field used to be. A "

The building is expected to cost approximately $6
million. Since the state did not approve plans for the
building, Pitt sought private funds from the Allegheny
County Bonding Authority. R0”, phom

pected to be completed in November, 1983. A

I itt Programming Council

By CAROL KROWITZ

A debate between G.
Liddy and Timothy Leary, as well
as a Broadway production and var-
ious movies, will be presented next
. "‘ by the Pitt Program Council

I \ PC). ’

This August’s freshman orienta-
tion will include Montana——“an
excellent rock band that’s making a
huge college tour throughout the
Eastern states,” according to Gina

Miller, assistant director of student ‘

activities for programming.

Montana will perform outside
on campus, Miller said. Also
appearing later that day will be
Nathan Davis and Tomorrow, his
jazz band.

Another end-of-summer event
will be Dr. ]ohn’s Frisbee Show on
the Cathedral lawn. The show will
consist of a one-hour demonstra-
 _n and a two-hour workshop of
Qsbee-throwing and -catching
techniques.

The PPC has both recently
released movies and classics on its
fall term film schedule, which beg-
ins with “MASH” on Sept. I and
“Taps” on Sept. 2. The PPC will
present “One Flew Over The Cuck-
oo's Nest” on Sept. 8, “Victor, Vic-
toria” on Sept. 11 and “My Fair
Lady" on Sept. 15. A Marilyn
Monroe double feature-
“Gentlemen Prefer Blondes” ‘and
“How To Marry A Millionaire’’—
and “Star Wars” complete the Sep-
tember film bill.

Other fall films include “On
Golden Pond,” “The French Con-
_nection,” “The Blues Brothers,”

""§:2IChariots of Fire,” “Midnight

Cowboy,” “Richard Pryor Live On
The _Sunset Strip," “Absence of
Malice,” “Porkys” and “Diner,”
Miller said. Several James Bond
movies, a Rocky and a Pink

..-~»--

“ ‘W Hews W

.’/

Panther filrn will also be shown.
The Liddy-Leary debate will
take place at Soldiers and Sailors
Memorial on Sept. 21 at 8. Liddy, a
key Watergate figure, and Leary, a
controversial figure from the 19605
who advocated drug use, will
debate on “Personal Freedom."

Oakland will host the Broadway
production of “The Fantasticks”
on Sept. 30 at Carnegie Music Hall.

Ralph Nader will lecture at Pitt
on Oct.~ 7 in a program co-
sponsored by PPC and the Legal

, Awareness Committee of the Stu-'

dent Government Board, Miller
said.’

Homecoming events are sche-
duled from Oct. 11-16, /and this
year's theme is “Up, Up and
Away,” Miller said. To highlight
the theme, PPCh'as arranged for a
sky-diving team sponsored by Bud-
weiser beer to perform during
homecoming. PPC had asked the
Budweiser balloon to land in Pitt
Stadium, but due to “unsatisfac-
tory air currents,” the balloon
would not have been able to land,

according to Miller.

The ‘homecoming concert on
Oct. 16 will feature a “big-name
comedian," Miller said. She added
that although no entertainer has
been contracted yet, Bill Cosby is a
po_ssibility.

Other homecoming events will
be the voting for king and queen on
Oct. 11 and a blood drive on'Oct.
12. A parade, pep rally and carnival

are scheduled for Oct. 13, 14 and 15. V

P. J. O’Rourke, a former editor
of National Lampoon will be on
campus at the end of October. A
lecturer now, O’Rourke satirizes
various college movements and
manners, Miller said.

Pitt will be hosting some “prom-

Miller said.

Students, staff and faculty may
attend all movies, but full-time
undergraduate students pay a
reduced price of $1 upon presenta-
tion of a valid student ID. All oth-
ers must pay $2. According to
Miller, the different ticket prices

for students and faculty and staff _.
are necessary since the PPC receives

all its funding from students’ activ-

1‘ ities fees of $24 for full-time under-

graduates and $8 for part-time
students.

“Last year was the first year with
the College of General Studies
(CGS). Now we have a permanent
relationship in which they are also
giving us 17.5 percent of their stu-
dent activities fee,” Miller said.

CGS full-time students now pay
an activities fee of $12, and part-
time students pay $4.

For the first time, graduate stu-
dents will be eligible to take advan-
tage of the PPC activities when

' they begin paying into the student

activites fee, according to Miller.

“We haven’t yet done the con-
tractural work, but it has been
approved,” she said.

The Graduate and Professional
Student Association will pay 17.5
percent of the student activities fee,
Miller said. I '

“Now that makes all University
of Pittsburgh students eligible to
get into events free or pay the $1 fee
for a movie. The concert ticket pri-
ces will be the lowest for every-
body,” Miller said.

Some programs, such as “arts, I

said.

TWO

By MATT HAWKINS

Aftab Kazi is a doctoral student
from Pakistan who studies interna-
tional affairs at Pitt. He is very inter-
ested in people and social systems;
it is this interest that has driven him
to do detailed research on South
Asian politics.

Kazi came to Pitt because he was
impressed by the faculty here, par-
ticularly with Djrs. Peter Karston,
Joseph Coffey and Richard Cottam.
His advisers and teachers have been
‘very helpful in the further develop-
meéit of his academic interests, Kazi
sai . I

He has recently written a book on '

Pakistan, The Problem of Military
Intervention in Pakistani Politics
.Kazi said he found the library here
useful in doing much of the
research. He hopes the book will be
published sometime next year. '

Kazi said that his book covers
Pakistani politics and South Asian
politics in general, focusing on
changes which he expects to take
place in the leadership of South
Asia.

Kazi said that his book deals with
factors such as ethnicity, which
have been ignored by most western
scholars for one reason or another.

Ethnicity, he said, has been the
major cause of instability in most
countries in the developing world.
This has been the case in Pakistan,
according to Kazi, where the repres-

. entation of various ethnic groups in

the military and political power
structures has been disproportion-
ate to their numbers.

Kazi also points to poverty,
repression and interference in, a
country’s* internal affairs from out-
side special interests as other
causes of political instability.

Kazi described the events that

   
    

8: Townhouses.

OAKLAND FURNISHED PTS.    
Luxury and Modern 1,2,3, and 4 Bedroom Units

began his research on his book.

“When I went home in January of
1978,” he said, “I went to Islamabad
to visit a friend...who told me that
lots of changes were coming.

‘‘I asked him whjat changes, and
he said that Ali Butto, Indira
Ghandi, General Daud and the
Shah of Iran were all going...

“I came back here in February
and by July the whole leadership
was out of power,” Kazi said.

“I asked the experts if they had
any ideas about what happened. I
started doing my own research and
found out that the Islamic Funda-

mentalist Party, supported by Saudi A

Arabia, was responsible,” he said.

In southern and western Asia,
Kazi said, there is growing competi-
tion between India and oil-rich Saudi
Arabia. Both countries have ambi-
tions of being a regional power, he
said.

“I discovered that, according to
some theories of international rela-
tions, not only do the big powers
have their sphere of inﬂuence, but
regional powers also like to create
their own spheres of influence,” he
said.

The Saudis’ support for a net-
work of Islamic Fundamentalist Par-
ties sheds light on events which took
place in Afghanistan, according to
Kazi. He pointed out that the
Afghan army overthrew their
leader, General Daud, and handed
the power over to the Communist
Party of Afghanistan because they
discovered that the fundamentalists

, were planning a coup of their own

against the Daud regime. -

The Saudis are not alone in desta-
bilizing Southern Asia, Kazi said. He
pointed out that the leadership in
Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan and
India are all planning to create a
South Asian market on the model of
the European Common Market.
This, he said, would give them can-

trol over raw materials and would
endanger the interests of certain
multi-national corporations.

According to Kazi, the Middle
East is a volatile region and condu-
cive to political instability and
revolutions. '

“The Middle Eastern political
situation is already polluted. The
level of political culture has reached
the point where the situation itself
will cause revolutions.”

This is especially true in areas
where there is widespread political
education coupled with repressive

regimes, Kazi added. 

As for the notion at the Iranians
are responsible for instability in the
Middle East, he said: “As long as the
people of those countries are kept
oppressed by the regimes in power,
there is always the threat of instabil-
ity. There are already revolutionary
conditions in the Middle East. It is
not a new thing which Iran would
create——no way. The conditions
already exist. Iranians may support
the revolutionary movements

. because they think of themselves as
a revolutionary government,” Kazi A

said.

Kazi likes to" keep up with current
events and dig for the motivation
beneath the surface. He spends h"
spare time reading foreign newspap-
ers and magazines; Kazi can speak
six languages. He also enjoys spend-
ing time with his fiancee, who lives in
Washington D.C.

Kazi is now expanding his inter-
ests to the area of international edu-
cation", an area in which he said he
has found Dr. Paul Masoner to be
helpful.

Kazi is unsure of what he wants to
do after he graduates, but said that
he is flexible and will find out what is
available.

Kazi is sure of one thing——he
wants to contribute to making this a
better world in which to live.

 To Be Aware
 Or Not?

Pitt students should make themselves
aware of what’s being done—both locally
and nationally--to insure that higher edu-
cation remains within their grasp.

The university has recently been study-
ing alternatives. Recommendations about
how to handle the rising costs of attending
and running Pitt have been made.

The University Senate Council took’ a

postive first step when it is suggested that
Pitt develop a university-controlled loan-
,fund. That fund would be free of govern-
mental control and would give students
seeking financial help another much
needed outlet.

Pitt administrators were also wise to dis-
cuss ways of economizing at their recent
planning conference. The emphasis was on
saving money by employing modern tech-
nology and reducing utility bills.

For a university that seems to emphasize
trimming academic departments or pro-
grams during lean times, the focus on the
reduction of “non-essential” costs is wel-
come relief. 0

Students interested in attending graduate

"school or merely paying off their loans
would do well to start watching what candi-
dates for public office have to say about
higher education. _

The Democrats who met for a mini-

’ convention in Philadelphia last week
offered few specific alternatives to Reagan’s
‘economic programs, but they did try to
present‘ themselves as the party that believes
in government help for those who need it-
including students. -

Despite what’s being done and what’s
being proposed, it’s hard to tell whether
students are actually concerned about
finances. _ _

A large percentage of, them don’t vote.
And one student group—the Young

S Republicans——refused to’ even participate
in the student government Task Force on
Student Aid. They -believed the group’s ”
goals were in contrast with Reagan’s
policies. 0

It's obviously important for students to

‘know what is and isn't being done about
financing higher education. Whether they

' care, however, and whether they’re willing
to do anything about it, unfortunately
remains  question.

Reconsider Reagan’s Policies‘

Dear Editor:

Will the Reagan Administration
reconsider its steadfast economic,
military and moral support for the
government of El Salvador?

In light of that country’s virtual
cancellation last month of the
long-awaited land reform program
upon which so many Salvadorians
and Americans had pinned their
hopes for a more democratic
society, one might expect such a
rethinking. But don’t bet a nickel
on it. _

Since the much ballyhooed elec-
tions in El Salvador March 28, the
actions» of the new Constituent
Assembly have revealed a sharp res-

\urgence of the right and of the

repressive policies that seem to
accompany it. Comments by pea-
sants, politicians and businessmen
indicate that there has been an
increase in violence toward the
populace (read killing) since the
elections according to a New York

Times story earlier this month.
month. A

Twelve moderate political
officials—members of the Chris-
tian Democratic Party—have
reportedly been murdered since
May l2.

Led by new assembly president
Col. Robert D'aubuisson, the cur-
rent regime has not even made
human rights or democracy into a
barely credible pretense. ,

This is a case of open and blatant
flouting of the promised demo-
cratic reforms that were‘ agreed
upon as conditions for continued
American support in the war.

Many observers now agree that
President Reagan is finding him-
self between extremists of the right
and left and that U.S. and hemis-
pheric security is at stake in the tiny
nation because of an ostensible
Communist threat from Havana,
the truth about El Salvador cannot
be kept secret any longer.

Every day, more and more Amer-
icans, Congressmen included,
awaken to the tragic reality that.
they are indirectly funding in a
very murderous junta. In fact,
those Congressmen who recently
visited El
finding totir are the ones most hor-
rified by the situation.

What begins to emerge is the
sinking feeling that no develop-
ment, however shocking. will dis-
lodge the Reagan team from its
likely losing position of support

for /D’aubuiss0n's regime.

‘ Perhaps this is inaccurate, but if
not, Americans can justifiably
expect Congress to cut back drasti-
cally on its allotment of aid, possi-
bly beyond the cut recommended.
by a 12-0 vote May 26 in the Senate
Foreign Relations (lommittee

Salvador on a fact?

from a proposed $166.3 million
outlay to $66 million in fiscal 1983.

It is the responsibility of our peo-
ple, our Congress and our media to
do whatever it takes to stop--or at
least slow—the flow of money,
weapons and advisors from
Washington to San Salvador
regardless of State Department
ideology.

Several issues have not yet been
addressed fully in the American
mass media, which, with notable
exceptions such as the Times, have
failed to cover the events in El Sal-
vador promptly and thoroughly.

To understand the El Salvador
situation today, one must begin by
realizing that there is indeed a bona
fide civil war being fought. Many
Americans are only now grasping
this. The combatants are natives,
not outsiders from Nicaragua or
Cuba.

One basic fact about outside
intervention is this: the only for-
eign military personnel in El Sal-
vador are American advisors.

U.S. security is not at stake
simply because the opposition is
suspected of getting some weapons
from Nicaragua or Cuba.

Most of the weapons employed
by the leftists have been captured
from government troops,‘ who get
nearly all of their arms from Uncle
Sam. Both sides end up blowing
each other away with guns from
the States.

Most American allies, France,
West Germany,_Italy, etc., oppose
U.S. military intervention. Mexico
is a leading diplomatic supporter
of the opposition Democratic

’Revolutionary Front (FDR)‘and‘

has called for a negotiated political
settlement. If there were truly a
communist threat so close, Mexico
should be the first to seek interna-
tional intervention.

As U.S. ambassador to the Uni-
ted Nations Jeane Kirkpatrick
indicated in a statement earlier this
week, the U.S. often gives the
impression of “behaving like a
bunch of amateurs” at the U.N.
and suffers already from an unfa-
vorable image internationally,
especially in Third World
countries.

Continued intervention in El
Salvador will further damage U.S.
prestige, whatever happens.

It" the opposition wins, the Uni-
ted States will again be on the “los-
ing” side. If massive aid allows the
military to hold off the opposition
(which enjoys support from “at
least 80 percent" o-f the population,
according to former U.S. Ambassa-
dor Murat Williams) a while
longer, Washington will feel com-
mitted to a long-term support for a
brutal dictatorship, and world
opinion will again be against us, as
in Vietnam.

The only way we can “win" is to
allow the people of El Salvador to

decide there own future. They haw‘ .
C .

been fighting for years to replac
U.S.-supported dictatorships.

The situation is worsening
daily; three weeks ago, the Times
reported that an estimated 34,000
civilians have been killed in the
past two and a half years for sympa-
thizing,- or being suspected of sym-
pathizing, with the guerrillas. '

Many of the recent victims have
been found on roadsides decapi-
tated. Is this what our tax dollars
are meant to pay for?

There are currently over 400
groups of American citizens oppos-
ing continued U.S. intervention.
These people recognize self-
determination as the natural r" _t
of the Salvadorians. These peclmi
see the civil war as the war of the
Salvadorians.

These people are unimpressed
with the phony elections of March
28. These people see that -land
reforms have been trashed and will
not be implemented by the current
oligarchy.

Most of all, these people do not
appreciate their taxes going to
facilitate the deaths of so many of
their brothers and sisters in El
Salvador. ‘

The time to end any and all aid
to the government of El Salvador is
now. The money is badly needed
here as we undergo big cutbacks ' A
vital areas like employment, educa-
tion, transportation and health.

President Reagan should be
joining with the president of Mex-
ico, among others, in calling for a
negotiated settlement, not pro-
longing a war that he cannot win.

Production of “The Merry Wives of Windsor.” seezox photo

By Christine Wiltcmger and Jill Savitz

   

The Pitt News, Wednesday, June 30, 1982

“There are 25 major Shakespeare
festivals and just as many minor
ones. In the first three years, we
quickly became one of the first
rank,” said Buck Favorini, execu-
tive producer of The Three Rivers
Shakespeare Festival and chairman
of the soon-to-be theater arts
department. —

Favorini is trying to make the fes-
tival the best in the country and is
quick to point out why it deserves
this title.

“We have one of the most beauti-
ful theaters available; it’s a national
historic landmark building. It’s in the
Gothic style, and it seats 600 which
is an ideal size for Shakespeare,” he
said.

Publicity for the festival includes a
Wall Street Journal article about its
“success in bringing a new audience
to Shakespeare according to

w Favorini.

‘ In fact, the whole idea behind this
annual event is to bring people to
the theater who were otherwise
leery of Shakespeare.

Favorini said, “the hallmark of our
festival is to produce the plays in a
very accessible fashion. Normally,
people think they won’t understand
Shakespeare, so our aim is to make
the plays understandable and
enjoyable.” .

Accordingly, “the publicity
emphasized that people shouldn’t
prepare themselves to see the
plays,” Favorini noted.

The one thing Favorini wanted to
get across to the public is that “if
they’ve never dabbled in Shake-
speare, there couldn’t be a better
moment to dip their toes in, so to
speak

“ ‘The Merry Wives of Windsor’ is
a particularly good play to see. It s
really hilarious, and it’s the only one
Shakespeare. wrote in prose,”
according to Favorini.

He added that “we have some
special effects planned for the pro-
duction of ‘The Wizard’(Prospero is
a wizard). Anyone who enjoys fan-

tasy films and literature will have a

great time with ‘The Tempest,’
because it inspired a lot of fantasy
works.”

  
   

Alix Cole:1an_tFrank Ford) and Arthur J. er (Sir 

Besides offering “Hamlet” until
July 3, “The Merry Wives of Wind-
sor” from July’ 10-24 and “The
Tempest” from July 31-August 15,
the festival offers a number of activi-
ties featuring the Renaissance
theme.

“The festival isn’t just thevplays.
We also have a whole series of
events that make it a true festival,”
said Favorini.

“For instance, before the Friday
and Saturday evening shows there's
a Shakespearean smorgasbord with
a gourmet meal catered by a down-
town restaurant, The Upper Crust.
And during the dinners, there's a
show called “Shakespeare on
Broadway,” featuring songs from
Broadway shows which have been
based on Shakespeare,” he
continued. —

The dinners and shows take place
downstairs in Stephen Foster Mem-
orial where the plays are performed.
Dinners are priced at $8.50 and Sun-
day brunches, which take place
-before the matinees, are $8.50. The
Sunday brunch features a perfor-
mance by a Renaissance song and
dance group.

In addition to the plays, dinners
and performances, “there’s also a
touring arm to the city recreational
centers that performs Renaissance
music, juggling and face painting
under the title Instant City Circus,”
said Favorini. The groups that per-
form around the city and at the
dinners are all part of Shakespeare’s
Good Companions. The Good
Companions sing madrigals and
other Renaissance-style songs for
free, about 30 minutes before each
play.

He added that “all of these side
projects stem from a desire to reach
those otherwise untouched by the
festival. They’re all designed to bring
people in and provide services to
make people’s lives brighter.”

One of the most important things
to keep in mind about the festival is
that it is designed to serve the
community.

Favorini termed the festival “com- I

fnunity service-oriented.” He said

_the people running it “feel that the

‘Windsor?’

people in this community contribute

_to' the university one way or

another, andwe owe it to them to be
preservers of culture.” —
Favorini also stressed the educa-
tional' aspect of the festival. “We
have a large educational responsibil-
ity. The plays involve Pitt students
who do it for either credit or pay,
sometimes both,” he said.

Although Pitt students are visible

V in the cast of the plays, they are hard

to spot in the audience.

“A lot of Pitt students went in the
first year when the Pitt Program
Council subsidized‘tickets. They
haven’t been able to do that the last
couple of years, and I think that’s
really cut back on student attend-
ance,” Favorini said.

Since there is a relatively small
number of Pitt students going to the
shows, the festival “has intituted a
student rush policy,” according to
Favorini.

About fifteen minutes before cur-
tain time, students and senior citi-
zens -can purchase previously
unsold tickets for $4. Tickets are
normally priced at $5 to $8.

A particularly interesting aspect
of this year’s festival is the way it was
cast.

“We did something very exciting
this year. Instead of casting each of
three shows, we cast one group of
actors for all three,” said Favorini.

This means that “the group doing
‘Hamlet’ performs at night and
rehearses ‘The Merry Wives of
Windsor’ and ‘The Tempest’ during
the clay,” Favorini said.

It takes a special group of per-
formers to meet the demands of this
grueling schedule, and Favorini said
“we're very proud to attract a group
of actors who are good enough to do
this.”

Favorini said the company is “an
extremely professional company
operating under letter of agreement
with the Actors Equity Associati-
on(the union for actors).”

“Normally when it’s an equity
company, everyone is a member,
but the letter of agreement allows us
to have some actors who aren’t
members, because we’re a develop-
ing theater,”Favorini explained.

“Most‘ of the staff and performers
are from the tri-state area. Four or
so are from elsewhere,” he
continued. ,

Favorini believes “we arelucky to

have a large pool of talented young
actors artists in this area. We have
our own degree;granting program,
as well as one at Carnegie-Mellon,
so the two combined give us a good
choice.”

While the festival is lucky to have
a talented cast, their financial situa-
tion is not as promising.

According to Favorini, “The festi-
val depends upon a funding conglo-
merate. A large part of the income is
from tickets sold. In the past, we’ve
received monies from CETA, from
the federal government and from
the college work study program.
CETA has been eliminated and the
work study program has been cut
way back, so we’ve been left with
about $40000 to raise.”

Although all of the money has not
yet been raised, Favorini said
“about $15,000 has been raised from ’
local organizations and corpora-
tions, and the box office is running
ahead of projection, so we hope that
we won’t run at a deficit.” ‘

Despite the financial cutbacks,
tickets for this year’s festival have
only been raised about 50 cents
apiece.

It is interesting that ticket sales
are well ahead of schedule, since the
publicity has “not been as extensive
as we’d like because we don’t have
money for ads," said Favorini.

“Right now we’re trying to get a‘

public service spot on one of the
local television stations, and we
think it’ll come through,” he added.

This year, which is the third year
the festival has been running, saw a
40 percent increase in attendance
over last year, so it looks like word
of the festival has spread, even in the
face of its financial uncertainties.

As for the future of The Three
Rivers Shakespeare Festival, Favo-
rini said, “I suppose the most impor-
tant thing is to improve the quality of
the acting company.” ‘

He went on to say that “instead of
expanding, we want to improve the
quality of the plays, so we’ll contiue
to do three of them.”

Favorini said expansion might
take place “about three years down
the pike, at which time we’ll expand
the festival into the school year so
Pitt students and high school stu-
dent will go.”

He said “we want to catch the
high school kids before they are

L Pittsburgh,” Favorini said.

can appreciate what he has to
offer.”

The three plays for next yearwill
be chosen from the following si
“Othello,” “King Lear,” “Richard
III,” “Henry IV, part I,” “All’s Well
That Ends Well,” and “Measure for
Measure.” Favorini said “Henry IV,
part I” and “Measure for Measure”
are almost definite.

“The festival is a project of the

Technical Assistance:

‘There Are More Things
In Heaven And Earth.... ’

When Hamlet, Prince of Den-
mark remarks, “There are more

, H things in heaven and earth, Horatio,

  

 

, an are dreamt of in your phil-

’ osophy,” he could very well have
been referring to the technical
aspects of the theater.

- “It's only when (the costumes and
scenery are) too opulent or don’t
work that the’ public notices them.
They take it all for granted,” said
David Jager-Walker, technical
director of the Three River's Shake-
speare Festival.

It is not only the actors and musi-
cians that make the Festival what it
is; there are also the men “and”
women behind the scenes that help
create the mood and atmosphere of
the play through scenery and
costumes.

As technical , director, Jager-
Walker is in charge of overseeing all
scenery construction. He works
closely with the director and
designers to interpret their _ideas
to the materials available.

The sets are constructed in separ-
ate pieces, like a jigsaw puzzle, to
aid in transportation from the shop,
located in the Cathedral basement,
to the Stephen Foster stage.

While scenery is the largest
aspect of his job, Jager-Walker also
' oversees all props. He designed the
lighting for this production of
“Hamlet” as well. Overall, he
believes the execution of this
“Hamlet” (his fourth), hasn’t been
particularly difficult, aside from a
few minor problems.

“The grave opening was a prob-
lem. It had to work easily and quietly
and yet it had to be supportive,
especially during the sword fight,”
he said.

Another problem was the lighting
for the ghost of Hamlet’s father.
According to Jager-Walker, the
problem was finally solved by the
use of a rotating colored disk in front
of a high intensity lamp. To insure
that only the ghost would shimmer,
a plate with a man’s figure cut out of
it was placed in front of the lamp.

“It’s considered to be_one of the‘
lighting effects that’s special. It
makes the ghost very ethereal,” he
said.

“ ‘Hamlet’ is very simple,” accord-
ing to Shevra Tait, set designer for
the Festival’s production of “The
Tempest” and scenic artist for
“Hamlet” and “The Merry Wives of
Windsor.”

“Most of it’s three—dimensional.
‘Merry Wives’ is slightly more com-
plicated, and ‘The Tempest’ is the
most complex.”

While the same scenery is used
for both “Hamlet” and “Merry
Wives,” new scenery will be built for
“The Tempest”——a pleasant change
for the guys in the shop, according
to Jager-Walker.

1 “Lots of times you get to building
the same old things. Now we’ll have
the opportunity to work in things
oddly shaped and ramped,” he said.

On the whole, Jager-Walker
believes “John Q. Public, probably

that you feel strongly about.

has little idea of the work that goes
into scenery or costumes.”

Karen Anselm Mackes, costume
designer for “Merry Wives” and
“The Tempest,” believes that the
public’s lack of knowledge is for the
better. -

“It should be more subliminal.
What the audiences sees should add
to that. If (the costumes) are too
noticeable, they detract from the
play. They have to'work with the
director’s concept.”

In designing and collecting the ‘

clothes for “Hamlet,” Henry Hey-
mann, an instructor in scene design
at Pitt, worked “very closely” with
director Kathleen George.

“We were more concerned that

the costumes were right for the
mood of the play than we were with

being -totally archaeologically
accurate.” _ _
According to Heymann,

“Hamlet” isoften staged “very heav-
ily; Kathy didn’t want this extremely
dark, deep kind of quality. She
wanted to do a court where ever-
yone wants to live and have a good
time—even Hamlet, in spite of his
dilemma.”

As a result, Heymann said, differ-
ent types of fabrics were used in
costumes throughout the course of
the play.

‘‘In the‘ first part, everyone is

wearing lighter fabrics; it’s only with
Ophelia’s death that we begin to get
heavier—more velvets, more thick
fabrics.

According to Heymann, heavy

A fabrics move differentlythan do light

fabrics.
“We were trying to get asense of

A more movement into the play than is

frequently done,” he said. _’

A curious feature of the festival
this summer is that none of the cos-

tumes are Elizabethan in design. *

According to Mackes, the last Eliz-
abethan staging was three years
ago, when the festival first began.

“We use Breughel as an inspira-
tion in doing the costumes for
“Merry Wives.” His period was
slightly before Tudor,” she said.

The work on the costumes for
“The Merry Wives of Windsor” is
currently underway, and shortly the
costume department of Pitt’s
theater department will begin work
on the costumes for “The
Tempest.”

‘“The Tempest’ is particularly
interesting because the characters
coming to the island are dressed in a

One thing on which Mackes, Hey-

amount of collaboration needed
between designers and directors.‘

The finished product, according
to Heymann, is “all part of the direc-

lot of running from one spot to
another,” Crass said.

The problem of singing songs
as widely diverse as the madri—
gals and the Broadway songs
was helped by musical director
Christine Frezza. Associated
with the festival since its begin-’
ning in 1980, Frezza wrote about
half the songs featured by the
Good Companions and worked
closely with “Shakespeare on
Broadway” director Ken Gar-
garo, “since he used five of the
Good Companions. We cast
them together. They had to be
able to fulfill many functions.”

Frezza is also the composer
and arranger of the -songs and
background music for the main
stage productions of “Hamlet,”
“Merry Wives of Windsor” and
“The Tempest.” Additional.
members of the Good Compan-

number two position in the Pitt
athletic department behind Dr.
'1 Edward Bozik may have caught
some people by surprise. After all,
it was just two years ago that Bil-
lick was responsible for the Sports
Information Office. Hardly a pre-
requisite for associate athletic
director. But one must look at the
contribution that Billick has made
to the program since he was named
associate athletic director for pub-
lic affairs.

The former sports information
director handled Pitt’s entrance
, into the prestigious Big East con-
ference and he has played an
increasing role in major decisions
.within the department. ,

For the time being, Billick will
V fem charge of the athletic depart-
‘ nt, despite "his insistence that
Bozik will be running things from
the Cathedral of Learning until he
. permanently moves his belongings
,to the Fitzgerald Field House on
September 1. -

Despite being tied to the chancel-
lor’s office, Bozik is already having
some input into the program,
according to Billick.

“There’s not really an acting
athletic director—I’m acting on
Dr. Bozik’s behalf,” Billick said.
“Dr. Bozik and I arekeeping in
touch—we’ve been on the tele-
phone three times already today
(Tuesday). It’s just a matter of geo-
graphy. He.has been keeping close
ﬁrtabs on what's going on.”

Billick’s promotion to associate
athletic director gives the former
news reporter a greater responsibil-
ity in decision making.

“The move clearly defines my
role as the number two man," Bil-
lick said. “It gives me more of a
leadership role.” .

Currently, Bozik and Billick are
working on a number of projects to
improve Pitt’s already successful
athletic program.

“Now, we are working on some
long-range planning and ways to
improve the upcoming sports sea-
, n, not only with the possible

national championship football
team and the entrance into the Big

  
  

also with the chances of having
successful seasons from our non-

dium in order to reap in the riches
from the new television contracts
offered by ABC and CBS. 6
“Right now, we are testing
around the stadium for the posi-
tion of the poles for the lights,"
Billick said. “We are also looking
into new designs. The physical
plant people are working on it.”
Billick said he hopes the lights
are installed by l983," he said. “It

will depend on the costs and the '

designs. We will have to discuss
this and make a decision.”

Billick said he hopes the lights
are installed by. 1983. ’

We are serious about havingthe
lights completed by the . fall of
1983,” he said. “It will depend on
the costs and the designs. We will
have to discuss this and make a
decision.”

One initial sign of a good work-
ing relationship is how Bozik and
Billick speak about each other.
Judging from Billick’s comments
about Bozik, both men should be
able to help the program.

Dr. Bozik has an excellent back-
ground for the job,” Billick said.
“He will bring a lot of experience
to the department. He has a lot of
ideas he wants to see through. He
will bring a lot of his good quali-
ties into the program. I am looking
forward to working with him.”

As far as his ties with the sports
information department, Billick
will not know for sure what his
responsibilities are with the office

until the fall.

However, on other decisions,‘

Bozik and Billick will not lie
around and wait for the leaves of
autumn to fall.

“We will not wait until Sep-

tember to make the big decisions,”

Billick said. “There is a big season
ahead of us in all sports. It is
important to continue to work and
move ahead with the program.”
Big, successful athletic programs

cannot sit around during this age’

of million dollar sports, or else
other athletic programs will
rapidly pass up the slower ones. Dr.
.Edward Bozik, along with his
right-hand man, Dean Billick, will
keep Pitt athletics near the pinna-

cle of collegiate sports.

amed Athletic Director

(0n[jnurd[1()m one

His management and adminis-
trative expereince were clearly
defined at the press conference.

Bozik, 53, a native of Donora,
received a bachelor's degree from
California State College in 1953
and a doctorate in political science
from Georgetown University in
1968. He served in the United States
Air Force from 1953-66 as an Oper-
ational Aircrew member and as a
‘Comptroller and Management
Analysis Officer.

After that, in 1966, he became an
Air Force Academy instructor and
later, in 1971, he served as chair-
man of the Academy’s political
science department.

It was suggested that Bozik has
had a ‘hand in Pitt athletics for
quite some time, which, judging
from his responses to a barrage of
questions posed by the media, was
believable.

The first issue concerned the
complete autonomy of the football
and basketball coaches. Johnny
Majors and Jackie Sherrill
demanded and got total freedom to
run the football program.

Bozik offered, “I intend to give
the football and basketball coaches
sufficient authority to manage
their programs. But the chancellor
asked me to run the athletic depart-
ment, and I intend to dojust that.”

Bozik next fielded questions on

playing basketball games at the

Civic Arena and installinglights at
Pitt Stadium, both of which he des-
cribed as being a matter of
economics. ‘

“l have an open mind on the bas-
ketball games,” he said. “If it’s eco-
nomically feasible and practical,

By BRIAN BALK

Sometimes superior quality can
be found in one’s own backyard.

This was the case when Panther
wrestling coach Rande Stottlemyer
and his assistant coach Chuck
Coryea went searching for recruits‘
at the end of last season.

Although their search barely
exceeded Western Pennsylvania’s
boundaries, it has turned out to be
one of the most successful recruit-
ing years ever.

“Western Pennsylvania is
always rated one of the top five
wrestling areas in the country,
Coryea said. “So we try to concen-
trate in this area especially.”

Within the past three years, the
Panthers have conjured up new

 

Panther sophomore Doug Haines, who participated in the NCAA Wrestling

  

Wesley Posvar

we will play there. We havealready
talked with Paul Martha (vice pres-
ident of the Civic Arena Corp.).”
As to the question of lights,
Bozik said, “That’s a very active
consideration. We have been look-
ing at the cost effectiveness and the
flexibility. We can't expect the
National League to reschedule its
baseball games for the first half of
our football season.” i
The -final issue was directed
toward the sticky area of athletics
and academics. Coming from the
chancellor's office and stepping

ideas to attract and lure local high
school stars to Pitt’s young wres-
tling program. Ideas such as wres-
tling camps, clinics and the annual
Press Classic ' have received the
notoriety needed to make Pitt the
future home for some of these stars.

“We have acquired a strong rela-
tionship with the local teams, said
Coryea. “This year we made a kil-
ling in this area that nobody could
match.” ‘ _

The Panther’s recruiting, which
has been ranked 10th best in the
nation, has already secured some of
the best wrestlers in the state. ,_

One of those recruits is Jack
Uppling, an awsome upper weight
from Meadville, Pa. Uppling not
only won a state championship last
year, but was runner-up during his
sophomore and junior years. He

Championships last year, will return this upcoming season.

into the athletic department, Bozik
said that there can and must be a
mix.

“This university will notrecruit
a young man, or woman, who does
not have a realistic chance of gra-
duating,” Bozik said. “This is no
different than the past, but it’s a

principle that I intend to abide by.” .

As the conference broke, Bozik

rose from the long table, whispered 4

a few words to Posvar and headed
for the door. It was a path that he
had travelled many times before.

Grapplers H ighOnFiecuiz/‘s

also has the state record for career
wins (134) and season wins (47).

The list of Uppling’s achieve-
ments does not stop there—he was
also named to the High School
National Team and was nomi-
nated to the prestigious “Dream
Team."

“Jack Uppling is probably one
of the best athletes we have ever
recruited here,” Coryea com-
merited.

Another top-flight local recruit
that the Panthers have managed to
secure is Kyle Nellis of Shaler High
School. Nellis won the state title at
his weight, 118 lbs., and was
runner-up during his junior year.

“Nellis has consistently been
ranked in the top five,” said
Coryea. “But he deserves a higher

rating than he gets because he has
defeated two of the individuals
who are_ ranked ahead of him.

Nellis was also named “The
Outstanding Wrestler of the Press
Classic” this year.

Nellis has an additional attrib-
ute that has little to do with cradles
and cauliflower ears—intelligence.
He, maintained a QPA of 4.0
throughout his high school career.
/He is gifted in the classroom and
gymnasium; that is a quality
recruit!

The list of local superstars con-
tinues on. _

Out of North Allegheny High
School, another WPIAL wrestling
power, comes Joe Bond. Although
no relation to 007, Bond may none-
theless prove to be a super agent
against the Panther wrestling foes.

“Joe lost a barn burner at states,”
said Coryea. But being the state
runner-up may have been a bless-
-ing foriboth Bond and the Pan-
thers, for as Coryea explains, “He
was a sleeper at 150 lbs.—many
other colleges overlooked him
because he didn't win states. We
think he has a bright future ahead
of him.”

Another ill luck incident which

' played to the Panthers’ advantage
was the recruiting of John Nanth
from Mount Pleasant. As a senior,
Nanth was seated in the top ranks,
and accumulated a record of l7-1 . It
seemed that he was well on his way
to a possible state title until a knee
injury curtailed his participation.

But Coryea speculates that Nanth's

-knee will be co_rr_rpletely healed ‘by

‘next fall.

has produced another talented
recruit for the Panther roster-—
Gary Bolin. Coach Coryea labels
him a “super tough” 134 pounder.

Every wrestler has off days-
Bolin’s disastrous day/"fell on the
day of the state competition.
Although Bolin performed poorly,
Coryea said that, the one match
was not an accurate assessment of
Bolin’s talent.

The Panther recruit venturing
from the farthest outskirts is Eric
Hertz from Altoona, Pa. Hertz won
his regional title but did not fair as
well at states. He will be shooting
for the 142 lb. weight class next
season.

Kurt Hertz was one Panther who
did not see any .action due to the
red-shirt transfer rule of the NCAA.
Hertz, transferred last year from the
ivy-covered walls of Cornell Uni-
versity where he had a successful
season, finishing with a record of
18-4. The Panther coaches said
they are looking to him to fill the
vacated 167 lb. weight class
position.

This is the third year for the
coaching staff of Stottlemyer and
Coryea. There have been many
changes in the wrestling program
at Pitt since they began their duties.

“The main thing we had to
change was an attitude problem,

‘explained Coryea. “We first had to

revamp the poor leadership in the

program. It was a total switch over

The Shaler wrestling dynasty.

 

 

iiich Esswein, along with a host ot top notch recruits, will be the mainstay of the

 

 

Panther wrestling team next season. .-

from when coach Adams was here.
Coryea said that leadership was
also the key to a successful
recruiting. .
“Now, it’s going to be easier to
work with freshmen,” he

explained, “since the older
members have formed a basic lead-
ership program, the younger
wrestlers have someone to follow.
It is finally paying off for us. Our
enemy used to be the system, now
it’s working for us.”

   

-

Coryea added, "Recruiting is
only an indicator of ‘ivhere a team is
going.” However, if it is an_accu-
rate indicator, it appears that the
Panther Wrestling team, with its
local recruite, is going right to the
top.

ignderclassmen Gain First Three Picks |nNBA Draft

By KEVIN TURRENTINE

The first day of the NBA draft
has been completed leaving many
of our nation’s basketball players
jubilant and many others
distraught.

This year's draft was labeled
“The Year of the Junior” since a
total of 12 college juniors had
declared hardship leaving them
eligible for the draft. In the draft’s
fi st round, nine of the 12 juniors

' » been snatched up. This years

draft was so rich in talent that half-
way through the second round sev-
eral All-Americas were still
available for teams to pick.

Fazio football camp...

This year, the Foge Fazio
football camp has attracted a
record-setting number of
participants—288 children
between the ages of eight and 18
have flooded Oakland in hopes of
polishing skills and picking up
tips'from the new head coach’s
debut camp.

The Pitt coaching staff has
turned out in full force along with
dded help, including Coach
"Malino from Linden, New Jersey.
According to Malino, the Pitt
‘camp seems to be the best to visit
this year.

“I take several kids to a camp
every year. Last year we went to
Clemson, and this year I see Pitt as
the best to choose from,” Malino
said.\

The camp, which lasts from
Sunday, June 28 to Friday, July 3,
was formerly the Jackie Sherrill
football camp.

Pro hoops in the
ena...

In hopes of securing a National
Basketball Association franchise in
the city, the 'Civic Arena Corpora-
tion in association with Pro Serv
Inc. and Dave Rober will present
the Pittsburgh summer Pro Classic
at the Arena on July 10.

The game will featurea Pennsyl-
vania team-—NBA players with
local ties——against a United States
team. Among the players who will
perform are former Pitt star and
Indiana Pacer forward Billy
Knight, former Duquesne and Los

‘ngeles Laker guard Norm Nixon,
\

an Antonio guard Johnny Moore,
Dallas forward Tom LaGarde,
Houston center Moses Malone and
Washington guard Keven Grevey.
Game time will be 8 p.m.

Pens back on TV 53...

The Pittsburgh Penguins, in a
joint announcement by Bill
Strong. vice president of communi-
cations for the Civic Arena Corpo-
ration, and Norris Reichel,

ﬂeneral Manager of WPGH-TV

' ve stated that the Pens will be

televised next season on channel 
in Pittsburgh. The Pens had been
televised during the 1980 season on

WP(}ll-TV’  and plan to televise

in all likelihood, will remain the
same. The powerful teams are tak-
ing advantage of their rare first
round picks. Many of the NBA
doormats are squandering oppor-
tunistic chances to satisfy their fans
as well as their chances to reach the
NBA playoff by not selecting the
best available player.

The first three picks of the draft
went with little surprise. Los
Angeles, "who had acquired the first
pick by means of a trade several
years ago with Cleveland and by
winning a coin toss with San
Diego, opted for James Worthy, the
6’9” junior from the North Carol-
ina Tarheels. ‘

L.A. sees Worthy as a definite

The San Diego Clippers had the
second choice in the draft, and they
quickly--grabbed DePaul’s Terry
Cummings. Cummings, another
junior, is most likely to be the
Clippers power forward, and at
6’9", 225 lbs., he seems a fitting
candidate for the job.

San Diego has been criticized for
their pick already by numerous
fans claiming that if the Clippers
plan on competing in Los Angeles
next season, they should have gone
for a flashier player, namely Domi-
nique Wilkens, in hopes of stealing
some of the headlines from the
Lakers.

The Utah Jazz did just that.

After averaging 21 points and 8
rebounds perlgame during his col-
lege career, Wilkens (6'7”) has been
touted as the next “Dr. J.” and was
nicknamed “the Human High-
light Film.” Wilken’s knack for
flamboyance will be a great aide
not only to the Utah Jazz, but also
to their attendance. He will bejoin-
ing Adrian Dantley and Darrell
Griffiths on the Jazz—a team
which now looks like the most
exciting in the NBA.

icks great boardstrength but won’t
allow Dallas much versatility in
the transition game.

The Kansas City Kings, who had
two first round picks, elected to
take the first center who was eligi-
blegand went for LaSalle Thomp-

a mystery.

had pick 11 in the draft took _

Lafayette “Fat” Lever, a 6’3” point
guard from Arizona St. Lever is
considered by Marty Blake, the
NBA’s super scout, to have been the
premier point guard in the nation
last year. Lever, who at 185 lbs.
does not quite deserve ‘his nick-
name “Fat,” averaged 16 points
and five assists as a senior.-

Pressey is another of the big
guards coming into the league at
6’5”, 190 lbs. and may turn out to
be the best defensive player drafter
this year. He led the nation with 95

The Chicago Bulls entered the
secondround of the draft knowing
they had already selected a stan-

V dout guard in Quinten Dailey of

the Universi_ty of San Francisco
and had four more picks in the
second round.

Their secondground pick proved"
to be one of the top picks in the
draft; they selected Ricky» Frazier of
Missouri.

Frazier is a small forward at 6’5”,
but he can play swing guard since
his shooting range stretches to 20
feet.

Some players, who during the ‘
college season seemed to be shoe- ,

As leaders of American youth organizations,_ we reaffirm our support for lsrael’s right to live free from the threat ofiterrorist
attacks. Despite the (15. arranged Israeli-PLO “cessation of hostilities” in July 1981, PLO forces have violated the cessation of
hostilities 100 times, both in the Middle East and elsewheref Over the last year, Soviet—armed PLO forces in Lebanon have used-
bases there for attacks on the civilian population in northern Israel. A

In order to end this continuing threat to peaceful existence, the Israeli Defense Forces moved against PLO positions in Lebanon
on June 6. We support lsrael’s right to take actions against terrorist bases in Lebanon. Such actions are in accordance with
Article 51 of the United Nations Charter, which allows U.N. member nations to act in self-defense.

We believe that the only way to attain long-term peace along the L_ebanese-Israeli border is’ by the restoration of Lebanese
sovereignty and the removal of PLO bases.

By BRIAN BALK

Back in the days when radio was
king and 75 cents could purchase a
bleacher seat in left field, baseball
was truly the American pastime. In
those days, fans would flock from
all points just to catch a glimpse of
revered players such as “the Babe”
or “Stan the Man.”

Baseball was more than a game;
it typified American dignity. Base-
ball heroes were heroes in every

 ,rlS€.

Tiiey were honest, hard working
and dedicated to their team. Pub-
licity rarely swelled the egos of the
stars of years past. They always had

- the time to autograph a baseball for
a fan.

Playing several years without
missing a game was not considered
a memorable statistic, ratherit was
expected of the players.

The term “free agency” was non-
existent and salaries never exceeded
five digits. Back in those days, the
game of baseball seemed a lot
cleaner, and “more American.”

But fads change, lifestyles
change and unfortunately, tradi-

 _' ns change. It appears that base-

' ball no longer fits the role of
America's pastime; the game is
now left abandoned, along with
the centerfield grandstands.

There are a number of factors
that have contributed to the game’s
loss of allegiance. What first comes
to mind is the astronomical salaries
regularly dished out by the fran-
chise owners.

Since many fans think of base-
ball as a means of recreation rather
than employment, it is difficult to
see the logic in million dollar
contracts.

Another attributing factor is the
more competitive society in which
we now live. In this society, where
winning is everything, feelings of

‘ ggression and violence” are more
I common toward our opponents.

The Pitt News, Wednesday, June 30, I982

gﬁaseball Is Still Supreme

Baseball’s laid-back action is no
longer sufficient as a means to vent
our own frustrations. We now turn
to the more violent game of foot-
ball for a catharsis.

Progress itself is to blame for the
dissipation of apple pie’s col-
league. With the emergence of tele-
vision, Americans have become less
patient, and now thirst for visible
action.

, When radio was the prime media
source, baseball thrived because it
could be presented in a structure,
organized and easy to listen to
manner.

However, when a baseball game
is presented on television, it is
loaded with tedious action—foul
balls, walks and pitchers warming
up—which makes for a seemingly
lacklustersporting event.

Yes, unfortunately, the general
consensus is that baseball has lost
ground in recent years and that
football has become the national
pastime.

Hogwash!

Baseball was, is, and perhaps
will be America's favorite pastime.

Sure baseball, along with every I

other sport, has its downfalls and
faults, but it is an integral part of
Americana which can not be disre-
garded. For example: What other
sport gives a fan 162 opportunities
to root for his favorite team? What
other sport spans eight of the best
spectator months, weather wise?
None except baseball.

Baseball heroes are the same as
they were years ago. Today their
lives may be filled with controver-
sies, but in a young fan’s eyes, a
man who smacks 54 homers or
steals 98 bases is not greedy, a racist

- or a bad father. The Pete Roses and

Willie Stargells of today are idol-
ized as much as any Hall-of-Famers
were in their heyday.

Believe it or not,gviewing a base-
ball game is still a happening

today. Old timers might argue, dif-_

ferently saying that they once
paid two bits for a bleacher seat.

However, nothing today costs
the same as it did years ago and
compared to a $21 football ticket or

sion price is still a bargain.

every situation, baseball is quite
elementary.

There are two sides. Each ‘is

Many say, ‘the simplicity

hypothesis that complexity is syn-’
onymous with excitement is not
well supported.

Having few intricacies and regu-

baseball understandable to almost»
all age groups.

In addition, the number of base-
ball and softball leagues still out-
number those of football by a ratio
of four to one. And who ever heard
of picking up a football game at a
family Fourth of July picnic?

The requirements for a national
pastime should be that the sport be
popular as well as enjoyable to dif-
ferent groups of people.

Sorry football fanatics, you've
got a long way to go because the
grand ol’ game of baseball still
reigns in America.
