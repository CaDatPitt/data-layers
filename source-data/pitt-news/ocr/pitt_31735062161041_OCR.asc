In correlation with the

Staged by Pitt faculty staff

“The Caucasian ‘Chalk Circle”
by Bertolt Brecht is a drama
about a young Russian woman
who sacrifices everything she
has to save an abandoned child,
later to have the mother of the
child return to claim it.

According to Dr. Attilio
F avorini, chairman of the theatre
department, “We decided to do

by the University of Pittsburgh

The biography, Ida Tarbell-

_ Portrait of a Mucleracleer, is

written by Kathleen Turner, a
staff writer for Time magazine.

Peter Oresick, the promotion
and marketing manager at The
University Press, said, “[The book]
covers the gamut from her
childhood in T itusville all the
way to the end.”

Pittsburghers were exposed to
Asian culture this week at the first
Japanese Festival sponsored by

he American-Japanese Society
of Pittsburgh.

The festival opened on Oct. 12
with a group of Taiko drummers

raperforming at the PPG plaza.

Over 1,000 people attended the
workshop on washi, the Japanese
art of making paper by hand.
Other activities included
workshops on ﬂower arranging
and kimono dying and lectures
by authors and businessmen.

about how they are going to
use the land. Half want it for
grazing, half want it for
agriculture. It’s sort of about
material justice.”

Favorini said, “We’ve got a
really ambitious theatre»
department. Both of our
productions this fall include
graduates [as well as]
undergraduates.”

The leading role in ‘The
Caucasian Chalk Circle’ is
Grusha, played byJane Gentry,
a third year MFA student.
Michael Dowd, also a third
year MFA student, is playing
the roles of Azdak and the
singer.

Other members of the cast
include Camille Hallstrom,
Jenny Noa, Steven Anderson,
Joseph Beidle, Benjamin Cain,
Stan Denman, Joel Garrett and
Saeed Sayrafiezadeh.

“Arms and a Man,” the other
production of the fall season, is

The author, Kathleen Brady,
has had one book published
previously, a novel titled,__Insz'de
Outthat became available in 1979.

Oresick said of Brady’s current
book, “I’ve read the book  it’s a
very strong account of a woman
I did not know much about
before. She was such a successful
woman in an age where men
dominated, yet she was not a
suffragist.”

Ida Tarbell did not join in the
women's movement, believing

. that the traditional roles of wife

and mother were the most
important. Along with her job as
a foreign correspondent from
Paris, she also wrote several

traditional and modern Japan. It
is going to be a bridge of
understanding between two
cultures, since Japan is going to
be a part of our lives,” said Michel
Misgalla, one of the coordinators
of the Japan Festival.

These festivals have been held
all over the Country in such cities
as St. Louis, San Francisco,
Houston, Washington D.C. and
Chicago. This year, Chicago held
a Japanese month. Pittsburgh’s
festival was one of the smallest
since it was the first one done
here. The coordinators hope to
hold a festival every year.

Favorini said that they are

Fraternity raises
funds for cancer

  

on Anderson/The Pitt News

Alpha Epsilon Pi, dribble basketballs for charity.

By Shelena Rauscher
For The Pitt News

The Alpha Epsilon Pi fraternity
held a “dribblethon” from 9 a.m.
to 5 p.m. in the front of the
William Pitt Union in order to
raise funds for the American
Cancer Society. All proceeds from
the event will go to the ACS.

The total amount donated has
not been determined, but the
fraternity hopes to raise several
hundred dollars. All 30 of the
fraternity brothers were involved.

The Cancer Society was chosen
because it was a local organization.
“We wanted to help a charity.
Most people haven’t chosen the
Cancer Society. We hope to make
this an annual thing,” said Marc

Rosen, a member of AEPL

“On the whole, the students
have been pretty terriﬁc. But
sometimes, when it’s for charity,
people don’t have money,” said
Matt Goldstein, social chairman
of the fraternity.

The fraternity chose dribbling
because “it’s something different.
It attracts attention, and it’s
something we can do for hours,”
said Goldstein,

Alpha Epsilon Pi was
recolonized last year; so this event
was a way to attract the university’s
attention. Goldstein said, “It’s one
way we can show Pitt we’re a
new group and we are just as
active. It is important because
charity is a part of the Greek
system.”

overwhelming. The people
embraced it. It’s a tremendous
success,” said Misgalla. The
response came as a surprise to
her because of the size of the
Japanese community in
Pittsburgh. There are only 600
Japanese in the area.

The performers in the festival
are all amateurs from Japan who
travel around the world to
perform. “All of the performers
fell in love with the city of
Pittsburgh. Some of the girls even
wanted to have their honeymoons
on Mt. Washington,” said Misgalla.

The AJSP is a group of 155

NTY—NINE

individuals and 45 corporations.
In order to become a member,
one must fill out a form and pay
dues. Membership is open to
everyone. The group emphasizes
American andJapanese relations.
It is also used to provide a forum
for dialogue between the two
cultures, according to Patricia E.
Winton of the AJSP.

The organization is based
primarily in Pittsburgh, but they
hope to expand to western
Pennsylvania and eventually
throughout the whole state. The
group would like to be able to

educate the public so they can
have a forum for businesses to
bring Japanese employment into
the area, according to Winton.
Besides the festival, the AJSP
tries to have one activity per
month. These activities include
lunches,
exhibits.
All types of people are involved
in the association and the festival.
Misgalla said, “The success [of
the festival] was that it drew just
the average Pittsburgher that was
interested in the events. The
numbers far exceeded any plans.”

 PPC + MTV= $$$

The last time we checked, contractual agreements were
signed in advance, guaranteeing both parties involved
that the services they intend to provide or receive are

, indeed provided or received. I
_ Apparently that is not the way it works at the University

A of Pittsburgh, at least when it comes to the Pitt Program

Council. MTV’s Remote Control television game show,
appearing on 18 college campuses on its Out of the
Basement Tour, stopped at Pitt for an Oct. 11 show at
Carnegie Music Hall. The winning student earned an all-
expenses paid trip to New York City for a’ future taping of
the game show. All said, all done, right? I ‘
But the PPC will not release the amount which the
university paid Remote Control to stop here. According to
Director T om Misuraca, the figures will not be in until at
leaséi-ngxt week. .

Figure-‘Ts are in from otheruniversities, however. The tour
"stopped at Clarion University on Oct. 4th at a cost of
_$10,000 to the school, plus an additional $2,500 in stage
set-up fees. An Oct. 8th show at Indiana University of
:§Pennsylvania ran $10,000 and $3,000 in set-up fees,
 according to The Penn. Dave Tomeo, Clarion’s Director
‘ of University Relations said the show was initially offered

to the school at $15,000 plus a $2,500 set-up fee.

According to Greg Drebin of MTV, approximately 1,500

. people attended the Pittsburgh show at a cost of $4 per

student and $8 per non-student. Close to 1,000 people
attended the Clarion show. _ .

From the initial figures, Pitt paid a minimum of $10,000
to lure Colin and Ken to Pitt, at least an additional $2,500
in set—up and security fees, expenses for the traveling
crew members and the stars of the show and a rental fee
for Carnegie Music Hall. Neither The Carnegie nor MTV
would comment on the amount spent and referred The
Pitt News to Misuraca, who would neither confirm none
deny rumored amounts. _ V

With or without comment from the PPC, it is obvious
that the show cost Pitt approximately $20,000. That is

. money that comes from student funds via the student

activities fee. When broken down among the ‘thousands
of students at this university, that may seem a mere
pittance. But only 1,500 attended the show, and they put
out four more dollars on top of their activities fee.
Assuming all 1,500 in attendance were students, which
they were not, the PPC recaptured $6,000. A net loss of
$14,000 so that one student can ﬂy to New York. More
power to him; he earned it by answering the right
questions. But it is obvious that the entire student body

the student body a detailed explanation of how they pick
and choose events for this campus. The PPC certainly
owes students a comment. And if nothing else, students

Why are we still risking ourlives?

‘ More Pitt students are using

was quoted as saying that there
has been a definite increase in
condom sales. In addition, Candy
Miller of SHS~surveyed Pitt stu—
dents to see how much they
knew about AIDS, and their

So, weknow the facts. But
what are we doing? According to
statistics given by Shirley Haber-

man, also of SHS, of the 66,

percent sexually active Pitt stu-

So, please tell me why so many
supposedly intelligent young
adults are acting so stupid about
the one thing they all need -
their lives. My guess is that most
people think that they are invin-
cible; that the girl or guy that
sleeps with them after a party or
after the bar closes never really
does this with anyone else; it is
always their first time not going
home. I guess it really doesn't
matter what their reasons are, it
all comes down to one thing.
When you screw around, you're
screwing with your life.

,1 guess by now I sound pretty
much like your mom or a SHS
employee or something, but I'm
not trying to. I guess, the reason I
got up on my little soap box is
that I feel I have to. I think
everyone should know exactly
what is happening in this
wonderful country of ours be-
cause of stupidity about AIDS.

Almost two weeks ago, I was in
Washington D.C. for the week-
end with a student group visiting

Gallaudet College. We were driv-
ing through the city and decided
to stop for awhile and be tourists.
Two friends and I started walkin g
around, not really knowing what
we wanted to see. We were near
the mall (the huge ﬁeld across
from the Washington Monument),
and wandered upon a large group

of people. We ﬁgured it was the
homeless rally that was being

I held that weekend, so we walked
over. When we were about 20 ,

feet from the end of the group,
one of my friends saw what was
going on. “It's the AIDS quilt,”
she said. I didn't even know what
the AIDS quilt was. It is a memo-
rial to all of the people who have
died of AIDS, made by their family
or friends and pieced together.
After I learned this, I looked
around and was completely
dumbfounded. We were stand-
ing on a tarp that looked like it

_went on for miles. There were i

thousands of people walking
around, so we started walking
too. Never before had I seen
anything like ‘it. There were dif-
ferent colors and different crea-
tions, but they were all made in
love and respect for someone
who, for whatever reasons, con-

tracted AIDS and lost the fight.

As we were walking along, I
just kept reading, names and
looking ‘at pictures. With every
quilt, it became harder for me to
keep walking. There are a few
quilts I know Iwill never forget
seeing. One of these was in
memory of a little baby “19-
months-young” it said. Icouldn’t
even read the name after that. I

 

kept walking and after a few
more quilts, I came to another I
know I could, never forget. The
name was Jeffrey Horne. Under
his name it said, “The first SF

AIDS death.” All I could think of 4}

was that, a few years ago, no-
body even knew about AIDS,
and then it started to spread
rapidly — mainly in San Fran-
cisco.

And there I stood, looking down

' at a‘ man’s black, shirt that had
been sewn onto a quilt by some— '

one who, loved him — and just

. stared. .When I finally did look

up, I realized thatl was crying. I
was crying for the people who
loved ‘this man — and all the
others. I was crying because this
man was just the beginning of a
long, sad story which may never
end. Iwas crying because more

than 11,000 people were repre-,::,

sented out on ‘the grass in our
nation's capitol. And most of all,
I was crying for the people who
were standing above names of
loved ones, and not able to
control themselves. And for the
ﬂowers set upon the quilts. And
for the pins people were wear-
ing, “AIDS doesn’t discriminate,
people do.” And for myself,
because I-knew at that moment
that I must know someone who
will die of AIDS. 0

If more than 11,000 people
have already died, think about
how many others have been in-
fected and will continue to infect
others. You read the statistics,
right here at Pitt. Figure the exact
number out for yourself if you
need to. Personally, I'd rather not

know. I think knowing the facts,

is enough.

Pitt tailback, Walker, showing glimpes of 1 988 form

By Mike Rampa
Asst. Sports Editor

Prior to the Pitt—Navy game this
past weekend, senior tailback
Adam Walker had rushed for 144
yards on 38 carries, did not play
as a starter and served a limited
role in the Panther backfield.

But there may be a new bright
spot in addition to Curvin
Richards, as Walker rose to the

T occasion as a starter against Navy

and rushed for 105 yards on 16»

carries with one touchdown. He
also added a touchdown
reception.

One man’s misfortune is
another man’s dream, and Walker
was certainly the beneficiary in
this case. According to head coach
Mike Gottfried, Richards was late
for a team meeting during the
week prior to the Navy game and
was benched for the entire first
half. Walker got the start instead

offensive line infringements such
as illegal motion and ineligible
receiver downﬁeld. Walker wasn’t
phased by the miscues and just
took what he could get when he
could get it.

“Anywhere [the offensive line]
can find daylight for me, I’ll take
it anytime,” Walker said. 

“They’ve done a fantastic job
all season. I’m very excited,“ and
I hope they continue to do the
work so the whole team can
benefit.”

It remains to be seen if Walker
will alternate with Richards more
often in upcoming games due to
his recent performance, but he is
simply proud to have earned a
spot in Pitt’s explosive backfield.

“We have an exciting backﬁeld,
and anyone back there who
touches the ball can go the
distance, so whoever is back there
will get the job done,” Walker
said.

Walker’s ankle injury in the
game against Boston College, the
fourth game of last season,
opened the door for Richards to
break in the starting lineup. Before
his misfortune Walker was
averaging 5.9 yards a carry. His
406 yards rushing and six

Panther recruits were declared

touchdowns were both team
leaders. Richards replaced Walker
in that game and rushed for 202
yards against the Eagles. With
both runners seemingly in top
form now, everybody will have
to wait to see what happens next
with them.

Pitt will be the recipient of a
week off before the much
anticipated clash with No. 1
Notre Dame on Oct. 28. So far
thisyear, Walker has remained
healthy but admitted to being a
little banged up from the rigors of
the season. The Panthers are
looking to rest and recuperate
during their idle time, and Walker
is no exception.

“I’ve got to get my legs back
and fresh for the upcoming
games. We can’t let the week off
bother us; instead we have to use
it toour advantage, rest for our
bodies and using everyday to
prepare for the upcoming games
both mentally and physically,”
Walker said.

Since Walker and Richards
possess two different running
styles — Walker with his straight

ahead attack which needs the big

holes, and Richards who swerves

and 9.6 rebounds last year), Bobby Martin

A year older and wiser, the Pitt men’s
basketball team opened preseason practice
this past Sunday in preparation for the

‘» 1989-90 season.

Pitt head coach Paul Evans will begin
his fourth year at Pitt, and he has a solid
nucleus to work with this year, as the top
six players from last year’s 17-13 squad
return. Depth will continue to be a
problem this season, however, as five top

academically ineligible.

To make matters worse for Evans, it
was conﬁrmed yesterday that starting point
guard Sean Miller, who needs only 76
assists to break Dwayne Wallace’s all-time
Pitt record of 436 in that category, has a
stress fracture in his foot which will
probably sideline him for four weeks and
perhaps even cause him to miss some
exhibition action.

That means that the strong front court
of Brian Shorter (who averaged 19.6 points

(12.2, 7.7), Rod Brookin (10.2 with 59
steals) and newcomer Darren Morningstar
could be counted on to make even more
of an impact than usual early on against
what is deemed to be the toughest schedule
in the country by Basketball Times.
“We’re happy to get back into practice
and get things going, especially when you
look at the schedule that we have,” Evans
said.
“We've had one setback already in

Sean. He hasn't worked out except for ‘

about 20 minutes on Sunday.”  _.

That may not bode well for Evans
early on, as Pitt will be staring the Soviet
Union's best right in the eye at the Civic
Arena on Nov. 24 for the first real test of
the season. From there, Pitt will play in
three tournaments, each of which boasts
at least one preseason Top 20 team, before
the grueling Big East play starts.

When Miller does return, he will be
joined in the backcourt by Darelle Porter,

Janelle I.antagne's consistant play has been instrumental in the lady Panther-‘s success.

By Jason Hillman
The Pitt News

The first thing you notice is
her wide smile, simply because
Jenelle Lantagne enjoys playing
volleyball. As the setter for this
year’s Lady Panthers volleyball
team, she plays quite a bit.

On and off the volleyball
court, this California native is
usually smiling. “I have a lot of
fun,” Lantagne said. “It always
is more fun . when you’re
winning and playing well, but I
love the sport.”

However much fun Lantagne

is having, she does not like to

lose.

“She’s very competitive. I can
say I’ve been pretty pleased
with the job she’s done setting,
especially playing against some
tough competition. She'll rise

to the occasion,” said head
coach Sue Woodstra.

“She’s a good inﬂuence for
our team,” said co—captain
Kelly Matheis. “She’s real
positive all the time, and she’s
always got that fired—up look
on her face.’That really helps
the team.”

As the setter, jenelle plays a
position that best resembles a
point guard in basketball. It is
her responsibility to call out
the offensive plays and to get
the ball to her hitters.

“Anyone can set me the
ball but not as good asjenelle, ”
Matheis said.

“She makes perfect sets. We
always have to work together.
If she can put the ball up
there, most of the time, we'll
hammer them."

In a position traditionallly
thought of as being for smaller
players, “setter” is being infiltrated
by taller women.

“I ’m usually going against other
players who are taller than me,

I and that automatically puts meat

a disadvantage,” Lantagne said.
“I have to make up for that in
some way, so usually in my

   

intensity and competitiveness. My
weakness is as a blocker because
of my height, and I don’t have the
incredible jump.” .

“I think she does a good job
with blocking. She could improve
on defense a little. bit, but she’s
doing pretty well there,” said
Woodstra. “She does pretty well

choices as far as who to set and

man volleyball as well as the
normal six-man set-up.

“It’s really different; you’re
touching the ball every other time.
You have to be a good all-around
player because to be able to hit,
you have to be able to set, you
have to be able to pass... do
everything,” Lantagne said.

Because volleyball does not
get the media attention of other
major sports, especially on the
East Coast, chances to play after
college will be limited for
Lantagne and her teammates.

“There really [aren’t that many]
opportunities unless you plan to
go to the national team or if you
want to go over to Japan and play
professionally. SO for me, one
avenue I might take is to become
a teacher and try to get into
coaching,” Lantagne said

“Another thing I have going‘

for me is that I still play a lot of
beach volleyball in the summer,
so maybe I’ll be on ESPN on the
pro circuit."

48 percent shooting from three-

the other point guard and co-
captain along with Brookin.

And so, a Pitt squad that came
on strong at the end of last season
basically has only one new look
— the 6-foot— 10-inch Morningstar,
a transfer from Navy, who could
give Pitt the depth up front that
many felt was lacking last year.

“I think Darren’s going to
help us,” Evans said. “Hedid a lot
of work in the summer and played
in the [Big East] Festival where he
had some competition for the
first time in a ye‘ar—and-a-half.
He’s not far off from some of the
kids in this conference.”

“Depth is a problem, but we’ve
had those problems before,”
Evans said. “I think if we can stay
away from injuries we’ll be all
right.

“The only problem we have

R with depth is practice. These kids

realize that there’s nobody behind
them to push them, and
sometimes they: get complacent.
“I don’t think that will happen
this year because these kids have
been around for a couple of
years and they're mature.” ’

A new Big East rule may
make a lack of depth academic
anyway. This season, players will
be allowed six fouls before being
ejected instead of the costumary
five in conference games.

“That won’t really affect us

~ too much,” Evansvsaid. “We may
be able to press a little bit more

and do a few things that we
otherwise could not have.

“Its tough when you only
have the six fouls for certain
games.We have to play Syracuse
(Ian. 25) with the six and then
have to come right back against
Arizona (Ian. 27) with the five.”

Several Panthers have put on .5
‘ weight during the offseason. Most

notably, Martin has put on 30
pounds, and Miller has added 15-
20 to his frame. . .Brookin’s much-
publicized battle of the bulge
continues. The 6—foot—6—inch
forward feels his ideal playing
weight is about 2 1 S-220 but would
not say how far away he was

I from those figures. However, he

was well below the portly 260
pounds he checked in at last
preseason.

Pitt Cross
Country
upset at
Navy...

By Mark Beattie
For The Pitt News

The cross country team traveled
to Annapolis, Md., last weekend
to face the Midshipmen of the

L Naval Academy. The Pitt runners

lost by only three points on the
hot and breezy Friday afternoon.

Pitt’s Keith Dowling finished
second. overall and first on the
team for Pitt, with a time of 25: 16.
Dowling, who made a strategic
mistake by breaking away too
early, lost to Navy’s Mike Conover
by nine seconds.

“It was disappointing. I could
have won the race,” said Dowling.

Finishing second for Pitt and
fifth overall was Paul Friedrich
with a time of 25:39. Third for Pitt:
and sixth overall was Scott
Humphrey with a time of 25:53.

“At Navy, I kind of fell apart.
The heat and pressure can get to
you, and I didn't run a good
race,” said Humphrey.

rm’ Jim Hamilton finished fourth

ii)

for Pitt and eighth overall with a
time of 26:13. ’ .

“lNavyl was one of my better
races this year. I really felt strong, ”
said Hamilton.

Ninth place overall and fifth for
Pitt was Craig Woshner with a
time of 26:58. Tenth place was

taken by Pitt’s Jason Bodnar with -

a time of 26:44. Finishing 11th

. overall and seventh for Pitt was

Eric Downer who ran the five-
mile course in a time of 26:47. ‘

On Oct. 6, the cross country
team went to South Bend, Ind.
for the Notre Dame Invitational.
Pitt, who faced many top-ranked

meet, finished fifth. Although the
team lost to some tough
opponents, Pitt did beat Malone

College who had beaten them .

two previous times this year.
Pitt’s Paul Friedrich said, “I felt

meet. I have hada disappointing
first half of the season. It’s tough
getting my head together. I hope

also so we do well this weekend.”

Big East Championship

1 This upcoming weekend the men's cross country team will travel
to Van Cortland Park in New York City for the Big East Championships.
All of the teams in the Big East are competitive this year, but the
closest race should be among Providence, who is ranked number two
in the country, Georgetown, Boston College and Pitt.

Last year at the Big East Championships, the Pitt runners tied for
third with Boston College, losing to both Providence and Georgetown.
This year Pitt coach Jim Lear thinks that his team will place anywhere
from second to fourth in the meet.

“We could run one of our best races and still get fourth. It is just
because of the quality of schools this year. But if we go into the race
with a good attitude, we could win,” said Pitt runner Scott Humphrey.

“This past weekend was a setback, but we bounced back from it
and we could win at the Big East Championships. My goals are all for
the end of the season, and this is the first meet that I’ve really
concerned myself with," added Keith Dowling.
