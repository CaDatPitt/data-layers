Runners go distance in

Ava Smetanka
Staff Writer

The heat was on at the Pittsburgh
Marathon this past Sunday. The Pitt
campus, marking the twelfth mile,
was alive with spectators who pro-
vided much needed water along with
lots of smiles, claps and words of en-
couragement. This was important
because the runners were just
finishing the most challenging part of
the course, the Forbes Avenue hill
leading into the Pitt campus.

Due to the race’s location, it
shouldn't come as a surprise that
many Pitt students were involved,
both as runners and first aid
assistants. On hand were 250 Pitt
medical students along with 60 doc-
tors, 3O podiatrists, 120 nurses, 80
paramedics and 13 physicial
therapists. All of the medical teams
were extremely taxed, making sure
that the runners were coherent and
had no signs of heat exhaustion.

‘According to KDKA there was one
medical person‘ for every five run-
ners. Many runners did collapse on
the course. Nearly half were reported
to be using the first aid stations for
ailments ranging from muscle cramps
to extreme dehydration. At the finish
line in Point Park, the temperature
reached 90 degrees and the humidi-
ty was 85 percent.

”Running 26 miles is one thing, but
running in this heat is another,” said
Kathie Bray, a Pitt student, as she
cheered the runners on ' Forbes
Avenue.

Moving the marathon up to April
for next year is an idea being tossed
around to possibly avoid the heat the
runners faced on Sunday.

Don Freedline, a Pitt student who
finished fourth in the race, also com-
plained about the heat factor. He said
that last year's marathon was hot, but
that this year's was no comparison.

Other Pitt runners were from the

Freeman to Maine

Pitt Executive Vice President Jack Freeman was officially appointed
chancellor of the University of Maine system. .

The appointment was made by Maine's board of trustees at a meetin
on Monday. Board clerk JoAnn Magill confirmed the appointment.

Freeman will be leaving Pitt on July 1, after having been at the univer-
sity for the past 19 years. He will replace Maine's current chancellor,
Patrick McCarthy, who plans to resign in August. Freeman will then
become the administrator and chief executive officer of Maine's seven-
school education system. He will supervise the presidents of those

Freeman could not be reached for comment and, according to
Jonathan Flint, an assistant to President Wesley Posvar, Freeman is cur-

, Freeman told the University Times that as the chancellor of Maine
he will be responsible for all the higher education in the state. Freeman
said that he plans to incorporate a research mission in Maine similar
to that at Pitt. It will strengthen graduate programs, especially in areas
which deal with the economic development of the state.

Although Freeman said that he is excited about his new position,
he told the University Times that he was enormously happy in Pitts-
burgh and that he will be leaving with some reservations.

Freeman and Posvar both came to Pitt in 1967, and they both said
that they have enjoyed an excellent working relationship. Freeman felt
that it was time to move on. He said that he feels this move will be
good for Pitt because there will be new blood in the administration.

Freeman currently serves as the chief administrative, finance and

at Jim Menegazzi’s home,‘ at which
was offered plenty of carbohydrates
in the formlof pasta. Many of the run-
ners knew that they could run 26
miles, but no one knew whether they
could withstand the heat and humidi-
ty sincethey hadn't trained or con-
ditioned for these high temperatures,
Even Don Norman, one of the lec-
turers for the class and the leading

man for 13 miles, who set the
'marathon’s pace, dropped out from
exhaustion but gave a spectacular
performance.

During the lecture he gave at Pitt,
Norman said that each race is dif-
ferent and that both internal and ex-
ternal factors are involved, such as
how you feel on race day and the
weather conditions. He proved that

each race was different and at this
Marathon he was able to finish only
half the course due to those factors.

Mary Giovengo, a runner from the
class and a business major, summed
up the feeling of running a marathon
in this way: ”Running my second
marathon is like going into labor with
a second child. You know what to ex-
pect and it's going to be awfully pain-
ful." ’

Eating habits affect cancer risk

Frances Sansig
For The Pitt News ’

Certain foods may reduce the risk
of getting cancer. That's the opinion
of experts that have found as much
as 35 percent ofall cancers could be

prevented through a diet high in fiber

and low in fat. _ ~

In a recent article in Vogue, Walter
C. Willett, M.D., a Harvard Univer-
sity epidemiologist, said, ”We will
probably never reduce to zero the 30
percent of cancers related to. the
diet.” .

The American Cancer Society's
Crusade held last April in Allegheny
County focused on the diet.

”The public is more aware of diet,”
said Sheila Lenchner, residential
chairwoman of the program. ’’It’s hit-
ting home. We're offering a computer
game where people can check in
what they eat and find out what kind
of risk they have. It won't be ab-
solute, however. We can't control
factors such as environment and
genetics.”

A distinction must be made be-
tween statistics that show deaths
-caused by cancer and incidences of

. ._

the disease. The ACS booklet ”1986
Cancer Facts and Figures" states that
in the 1940s one in four people could
expect to survive after developing
cancer. Now it is four in ten.

”The overall mortality rate is
basically the same,” said Ruth Bugler,
a counselor at the Fox Chase.Cancer
Center. ”But that doesn't reflect
what's happening. More cancers are
being discovered and labeled.”

The ACS recommends a diet low
in fat and high in fiber to avoid con-
tracting types of cancer such as co-
lorectal. Certain foods containing
vitamin A, such as yellow vegetables,
help prevent respiratory cancers, ac-
cording to experts.

”The question is what type of fat
should be eliminated,” Evans said. ’’I
have not been able to answer that
myself.”

How does this high-fiber diet work
to prevent cancer? ”The current
thought is that it keeps toxic
substances away from the bowel,”
Evans said.

The ACS diet should not be con-
fused with the macrobiotic diet —
one which is high in fiber but com-
pletely eliminates dairy products, a

main source of calcium and vitamin
D, from the diet. The recent wave of
calcium deficiency makes this diet
seem risky.

Evans said she has been involved
with several patients on a macrobio-

tic diet, and it has not proven‘

effective.

The National Cancer Institute has
placed its seal on several national
brand-name product advertisements,
including high fiber cereals. As to
whether this is increasing public sales
of these products, no statistics were
available. However, Evans hopes that
this form of advertisement will help
decrease the incidences of certain
types of cancer.

Most supporters of this diet, in-
cluding Evans, purport that the diet
is only a preventive measure, not a
cure. A single diet may not work for
everyone. A

”You have to take into account a
person's past food-intake, current re-

quirements and future needs," said .

Evans. She said that although we are
constantly trying to discover a cure,
a positive attitude is crucial in the war
against cancer.

JOHANNESBURG, South Africa -
Monday, South African forces attack-
ed the capitals of Botswana, Zim-
babwe and Zambia in what officials
said was an action aimed at the
outlawed African National Congress.
Airborne commandos hit the
Botswana capital of Gaborone and
the Zimbabwe capital of Harare, kill-
ing three people and injuring eight
others. An air strike against the Zam-
bian capital Lusaka caused damage,
but no casualties. South African of-
ficials said that the raids were ”a pre-

emptive strike against terrorists to»

protect its citizens.” Pretoria com-
pared the attacks to the U.S. strike on
Libya, but President Reagan quickly
retorted such comparisons and was
outraged by the attacks. Reagan also
said that he is considering recalling
the U.S. ambassador to South Africa
to protest the incident. Officials of
Zambia and Botswana said that they
do not know of any ANC members
being injured, but said that several
civilians were hit. Earlier, South

African police found a large storage -

of hidden arms believed to belong to
the ANC.

leased 95 passengers from the plane
but is still holding the five crew

Charges filed
against NBC

WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Yester-
day, the CIA charged that an NBC

law by disclosing secret data related
on the spy case of a former National
Security Agency worker. CIA direc-
tor William Casey said that the mat-
ter has been turned over to the Justice

According to Casey, NBC reporter

ing to Coast Guard officials four of
the crew are still missing and are
feared dead. Eight survivors were
rescued Monday by a tanker, after
they spent four days aboard a life raft.

High Court bars
Affirmative Action

WASHINGTON, D.C. —— Monday,
the Supreme Court dealt a blow to Af-
firmative Action by ruling unconstitu-
tional a Michigan school boards plan
for laying off teachers which gave
preference to minority groups. Under
the school board's plan, white
teachers had been laid off even
though they had more seniority than
some black teachers at the school.
The idea behind this system, stated
a board official, was to have a cer-
tain percentage of black teachers cor-
responding to a certain percentage of
black students. But, in a 5-4 decision,
the court ruled that eight white
teachers’ right to ”equal protection
of the law” was violated under the
plan. Experts said that the ruling does
seem to support some uses of affir-
mative action by governmental
employers.

Reagan may scale
back Saudi deal

WASHINGTON, D.C. —— Yester- 1
day, Senate majority leader Robert I
Dole said that President Reagan may
modify an arms package for Saudi
Arabia to get more support for the
deal in the Senate. Dole said that one
of the changes in the $354 million
deal might be elimination of the
Stinger anti-aircraft missiles. Reagan
would not comment‘ on D0le’s
remarks. Earlier, both the House and
the Senate had turned down the arms
package earmarked for the Saudis.
Reagan, however, who wants to see
the deal go through, has promised to
veto Congress’ denial of the arms
sale. The president admits, however, 3
that he might not have enough sup-
port to sustain the veto.

America to join hands in battle againsthunger

Pittsburgh  
hit hard
by hunger

David Zafris

New; Editor

While Hands Across America
will raise millions of dollars to
combat hunger in this country, it
will not put an end to hunger na-
tionally or locally. Unemployed
steel workers, single parents trying
to feed a family and low-paying
jobs have left thousands in
Allegheny County unable to afford
to eat every day.‘ I

The number of hungry people in
Allegheny County is difficult to
measure, but the amount is large.
Nearly 10 percent of the county's
population receives food stamps.
In February 130, 705 people in
the Pittsburgh area received food
stamps, according to the Hunger
Action Coalition.

”There definitely is hunger in
Pittsburgh,” said Pat O’Ma|ley,
food development specialist for
HAC. "It's in every neighborhood,
even the suburbs. It's in places
like Upper St. Clair and Mt.
Lebanon as well as the E
economically depressed areas.”

While the percentage of people
receiving food stamps in

 

        

Allegheny County is higher than
the state average, this number is
misleading. O’Ma|ley estimates
that at least 25,000 people in the
area are eligible for food stamps,
but for one reason or another they
do not apply for help.

"A lot of people after they are
laid off try to make it without any
kind of assistance,” O’Malley said.
”When the unemployment checks
run‘ out and their savings are
depleted, these people often go
hungry. They don't take advantage
of food stamps because they are
too proud or embarrassed.”

The HAC supports about 150 in-
dependent pantries that provide
emergency food relief to needy
people. Often the head of a
household will be given a bag of
food to carry his family through
the week.

”People get interested in stop-
ping hunger every few years,”
O'Malley said. ”Then the media

attention dies down but the prob-
lem doesn't go away.”

Another organization fighting
local hunger is the Greater Pitts-
burgh Community Food Bank. The
food bank distributes food to
about 300 local non-profit agen-
cies that offer meals for the needy.

At the Rainbow Kitchen in
Homestead, about 75 people are
fed each day. The kitchen was
founded nearly four years ago
when most of US. Steel's workers
were laid off.

Frank Dorsey, who works at the
Rainbow Kitchen, said that one of
the hardest problems is offending
the pride of unemployed
Pittsburghers.

”l'l|-tell some unemployed guys
to come and get some help and
they say, ‘No, way —— mY Parents
didn't do /it and I won't do it.’
They won't accept anything they
see as a hand out. What can you
do?” '

Americans need aid

Mark Zaetta
For The Pitt News

Amid the novelty of next Sun-
day's transcontinental human
chain is the hope-flooded motive
that the occasion will alert the
American public to the problem of
domestic hunger. '

Fortunately, for most of the
poor, hunger is not experienced
on a day to day basis, but rather
two to 10 days out of the month
when the apportioned food stamps
begin to run low or become com-
pletely exhausted. According to a
Harvard University task force, a
minimum of 20 million U.S.
citizens suffer from hunger.

During the first years of the;
Reagan administration more
stringent requirements for food
stamp eligibility were imposed. A
family of four with no net income
now receives $264 a month in
stamps, and this amounts to ap-
proximately 70 cents per meal per
person. As a result, food stamps
are only supplemental for most
families.

The growing demands of the
hungry poor is reflected in the
changing budget of the food

stamp project. As a fledgling pro-
gram in 1964, it was allocated
$218 million to serve about
360,000 people. Since then, the
number of hungry poor in the
United States has skyrocketed, and
the food stamp budget has
dramatically increased. Budget
recommendations for 1987 are
over $18 billion, designed to
serve nearly 21 million people.
Unfortunately, emergency

assistance is not keeping pace
with the needs of the poor. A
survey by the U.S. Conference of
Mayors found that requests for
emergency food were up 28 per-
cent in 1985, and 17 percent of
this demand went unmet. The

survey also showed that there are I

15 million people living below
the poverty level who are
theoretically eligible for food
stamp aid, yet do not receive it
because of red tape, lack of infor-
mation or fear of stigma. Of these
poor who receive food stamps, 5
million are known to run out of
them before the end of the month.

Legislators may argue over inter-
pretations of hunger, but all agree
that lack of food in a country as ‘
wealthy as the United States is a‘

"very embarrassing irony.

Wasting Away

We live in a high-tech society. In fact, we
would be rendered helpless if our modern toys
of convenience were removed. Technology is a
valuable undertaking. Improving methods to
complete difficult tasks is a noble endeavor.

We must, however, monitor the development
of technology and not allow it to control us.
Abuse of technology is as terrifying as Imelda
Marcos on a shopping spree with credit cards in
hand.

Today, nuclear power has become com-
monplace. Until the Chernobyl nuclear disaster,
no one was giving much thought to nuclear
power. Sure, we had a little scare in '79 at Three
Mile Island, but that blew over as quickly as it
came to our attention.

Nuclear power is the power source which must
be perfected and made safe before another Cher-
nobyl happens. Nuclear plants cost billions of
dollars to build and operate. These costs are more
than covered by the power that the plants pro-
duce. Maybe. You see, nuclear plants are com-
pletely useless after only 30 to 40 years. As a
plant continues to operate for this length of time,
it becomes too radioactive. to function safely.
Even worse, there is no way to dispose of nuclear
waste of the plants after they are used up.

Developing proper means of disposing nuclear
waste products must become top priority.
Nuclear power is here to stay. But we must
harness it 3 power and use it for humanity's good.

Goodies

Dear Editor,

A few weeks ago, I received a flyer
telling me to boycott Goodies. (a can-
dy and ice cream shop on Oakland
Ave.) because it sold candy made in
South Africa. Recently I stopped in to
ask the owner, Chris Warman, if he
still sold such candy. He told me the
following: After receiving a hostile
phone call informing him that he was
selling candy made in South Africa,
he immediately removed the candy
from the shelves, taking a large finan-
cial loss. Despite his sympathy for the
cause and his prompt cooperation, a
protest was held in front of his store.
Later that afternoon, three men (about
35 years old and presumably not
students) came into his store and
threatened his life and the life of his

 

wife who is eight months pregnant.
His wife had to be taken to her doc-
tor because of the stress and is now
fearful to work in their store.

I was very sad to hear this. We who
work for peace and justice must seek
to live and interact with others in
such a way that promotes our ideals.
Dialogue and education are the best
tools.

Mr. Warman is owed an apology.
Please stop in and patronize his
business.

Skinhead divine comedy

Oakland Bohemia received a rude
shock with the arrival of the skinhead
army. Taking dissension to new
tangents ”Death to Reagan” can be
seen painted on area bridges. Mean-
while, the hipsters —— with
characteristic difference — quip, ”Ig-
nore them, they're idiots.” That was
until the skins began to arrive at par-
ties, tearing screen doors off the
hinges, punching windows and
treating women with criminal
rudeness. These guys have a Hitler-
like attitude, ”Hey, I'm hardcore. I'm
big. I can control you, and there ain't
nothin’ nobody can do about it.”
Many skinheads are trying to
disassociate themselves from the
Nazi Punks. But don't let that fool
you. They can no more disassociate
themselves from skintrash jingoism.
Slogans like ”Kill Reagan” can
separate the Nazi Punks from the
New Right. We are dealing part and
parcel with a moral breakdown stem-
ming directly from the Reagan
Revolution. With 45 percent of our
tax budget going to military purposes,
this is a culture of strength worship,
which is why these skinhead losers
can get away without disciplinary ac-
tion. The muscle is holding the mind

hostage in Oakland Bohemia.

The very limited appeal of .

skinhead fashion tends to make the
movement into a circus, rather than
a serious abomination. But it is this
attitude of, ”Ignore them" which
troubles most. Many fanatics are
given too much attention by the
press, which in turn increases their
power, which is a warning to any
press report on neo-Nazis'or other
freakshows in politics. Nevertheless,
one band suggests that these young
humans not only refuse to take their
own lives as valuable, but also seem
interested in undermining other peo-
p|e’s right to take themselves
seriously.

Lately, I have seen far too many
bloody noses at parties to continue
enjoying the joke. The blood on the
wall, the blood on the grass, the
threats, the broken glass, the
mutilated bicycle, all suggest to me
that more, not less, trouble is ahead
for the Oakland Bohemia, where
once a good scene did dwell. The

“ignore them” crowd has an alliance

with the ”we’ll handle it ourselves”
crowd and the twain have yet to sug-
est a more plausible solution than

”deal with it when we have to."

Generally, the attitude of the public
tends to reinforce the attitude that
nothing can be done. Nancy Reagan
has launched this absurdly inflated
fight against the evils of marijuana,
in a shadow-boxing match against the
stereotypes of her own imagination.
Factually, the drug problem is a result
of young people who like getting
high and who don't believe mari-
juana threatens them more than say,
nuclear energy, and grossly exag-
gerated punishments on the law
record books which discourage any
effort to confront the problem within
the context of the system. Actually,
the New Right attitude is one which
increases the drug problem by mak-
ing young people even more
suspicious of the system and more
prone to ignore its advice. In turn, this
distrust leads to paralysis against the
phenomenon of skinhead neo-nazi
punks bashing windows at beer
blasts. Where the system offers no
recourse, the intellectuals enjoy the
rapture of a poetic anarchy; the ig-
norant indulge themselves of a few
extra rude remarks, and the naive go
to sleep and hope they wake up
somewhere else.

Taking a stand against drug testing

”Right this way, please.”

Spent four or five years at Pitt party-
ing, have you? Now that you've
graduated, you've gotten a haircut
and an interview suit in order to help
you get a ’’real’’ job. You'd imagine
that a good-paying, challenging posi-
tion is yours via your good grades,
determination and your sincerity to
be successful, even more so if your
uncle is in that company's personnel
department. Your resume is im-
maculate, your references as solid as
you could arrange  your armpits
soak with perspiration as you give the
interviewer the stock responses that
a sweating interviewee is supposed
to utter. Think you're sweating noyv?
Wait until you hear about that com-
pany’s new drug screening program.

Seriously, that should be enough to

get the average, sociable person
sweating. I don't mean just our elite,
steroid scholars who can afford the
more exotic illegal substances to give
them and their groupies the illusion
that they're somebody special. No. I
mean anyone who indulges in even
an occasional joint better worry.
Now you yuppies are going to find
out what those of us who were in the
military have known for years: You
no longer have bodily automomy.
Years ago, I had to put up with ran-
dom urinalysis testing to see who did
what over the weekend  of course,
we found ways of fighting back. I've
turned stale beer in at times, and I
won't bore you with other strategies.
One takes it for granted that in the
military, no one has human or civil
rights of any sort after all, we were

defending liberty and freedom, so
why should we have any?

Now it's spread to the civilian sec-
tor. Mind you, attitudes towards mari-
juana change with who is in office.
The Carter administration recomend-
ed decriminalizing grass, much the
same way Mayor LaGuardia of New
York recomended many years before.
Representatives of the American
Psychiatric Association finally admit-
ted that pot smoking among young
adults was ”normal” behavior. Last
year, Alaska did not arrest anyone
during Attorney General Meese’s
crackdown on pot growers. Hey
Meese, why don't you pick on heroin
smugglers or cocaine tycoons? Even
Spain mellowed out on pot smokers
for the last three years.

So, pot smokers, your ‘’normal’’

Havana Daydreaming/G.B. Patterson
Unheralded stars of the marathon

Last Sunday I was down at Point
State Park. The Marathon was over.
With my finisher’s medal around my
neck, I stood with my hands on my
hips and was pleased. I must not
mislead you, though. I did not really
finish the race. In fact, I didn't even
run in it. A kind gentleman at the
finish area gave me a finisher’s medal
as a souvenier.

This medal means a lot. Granted,
if I actively pounded the 110 degree
pavement for 26 miles, the medal
would mean something completely
different. What the medal signifies to
me is superhuman effort, an effort by
the 3,000 runners, all the fans, the
organizers, and an effort by a group
you will hear a little about.

The group about whom I speak is
the medical support team that man-
ned four recovery tents at the race’s
end, as well as field facilities along
the marathon route. This group was
made . up of volunteers, nurses,
paramedics and physicians who
treated any runner who had suffered
from the excessive heat and humidi-
ty on Sunday.

The four tents at the race end were
divided into two sports medicine
tents, a general medical tent and an
intensive care tent. Along the 26
miles, there were 20 field units in
case the runners could not make the
distance. Dr. R.D. Stewart, the Pitts-
burgh City Medical Director, said that
these field units prevented ill runners
from trying to go too far, thus prevent-
ing over-crowding at the four
finishing tents.

I was amazed at the profes-
sionalism with which these medical
teams handled dehydrated, and often
incoherent athletes. They were quite
comforting, yet they were able to
conduct the standard tests to check
on a runner’s condition. These tests
checked a runner’s temperature,
blood-sugar level, heart rate and
blood pressure. Almost all of the
athletes who required medical atten-
tion were given an IV to bring their
body fluids back to normal. They
were also cooled with wet towels.
One runner from Michigan said that
the medical care he received in Pitts-
burgh was the best of any marathon
in which he had run.

What most impressed me was the

behavior may impede your attempt
to find gainful employment in this
land of the free and home of the
brave. What are you going to do
about it? Probably nothing. I never

my congressman’s secretary would
care to read about George
Washington growing a patch of

Texas seven years ago, it wouldn't get

fessionals give to their patients and

for revenue gained from busting dope
gophers and car thieves. If I'm ever

that lovely town an above-ground

Generally speaking, all of you
worldly folks had better watch
yourselves. If you're the sort who
would rather relax with a doobie in-
stead of rotting away your brain, liver
and sex life with alcohol (like good
little Americans), you'd better do one
of the following three things:

I. End your evil ways, drink heavi-
ly, become a religious fanatic.

2. Ask a vet how we used to beat
drug screening.

3. Stand up for your rights or look
forward to Gulag America.

The medal I received is special to
me because it reminds me that there
are people out in the world who real-
ly care about their work and other
people. I dedicate my medal to all the
professionals, who are too numerous
to mention.

Tom Cruise offers topnotch thrills in Top Gun

Bruce Kasrel
For The Pitt News

When Tom Cruise first slid across
the screen in- Risky Business, this
underwear-clad actor became an in-
stant star. Confident and good look-
ing, Cruise, armed with a ”trust me”
grin, had women wooing and men
rushing to their optometrist in search
of Ray Bans. Cruise is again hitting
the screens with three new films:
Legend, Top Gun, and The Color of
Money (slated for a Christmas
release). Earlier this month, I had the
chance to talk to Tom Cruise about
Top Gun, his career and himself.

As jet-fighter pilot Pete ”Maverick”
Mitchell, Cruise is given the oppor-
tunity to expand on the Joel Goodsen
character. Cruise's slick portrait of the

defiant ”Mav” will again havei

women spellbound and optometrists
stocking up on aviator glasses. Both
live life on the edge and get the pretty
lady, but the main difference
between the two is age. At 24,
Cruise, although he looks 19, is

P, maturing as an actor and has left the

adolescent in search of Losing it (a ti-
tle of a lesser known Cruise film). ’’I

look forroles that will stretch me in»

my personal and artistic growth,”
said Cruise.

Pretty philosophical words from a
guy who dives onto his sofa while
singing to a fireplace decoration. But
with Tom Cruise, the saying ”don’t
judge a book by its cover” truly
apphes

As all the college writers sat waiting
for our 45 minute interview, we
came to a consensus assumption
about Cruise — a guy this good look-
ing and talented is bound to be just
like his screen personality. We
couldn't have been more wrong.
Although ambitious and aggressive,

Cruise is friendly and sincere. Cruise 
was very straight forward about

himself, never forgetting the main
purpose for the chat, to plug Top

gCun. And plug he did.

The first question on everybody’s
mind, including Cruise's was the
military’s influence on Top Gun. The
movie is about the Navy's elite group
of fighter pilots who shoot it out in
the skies over California as they com-
pete in simulated battle scenes/train-
ing missions.

”When people heard about it they
thought it was a war movie. But it's
not. If we had wanted to make a war
film, we would have had battle
scenes and explosions all through the
film. It's a film about character. The
opponent (in the single battle scene)
is a nameless, facelessopponent sym-
bolic of Maverick wanting to
challenge himself. But when you
look at the story, it is an environment
where the drama is heightened,
which is exciting for an audience to
see. Everything is brought right to the
edge in terms of competition.”

Sounds reasonable, but later in the
day, the ”pros” — who had already
made up their minds that this was on-
ly a war film and there was nothing
Cruise could say to alter this —— drilled
Cruise on the topic. One reporter,

’ hoping to catch Cruise off guard,

asked if he would have taken the role
if it were a war film. ”No, I'm not in-
terested in those kinds of movies.
When I look at a role, I look at it in
terms of the character. I'm not in-
terested in making a war film.” But
judging from recent reviews, he
didn't change their minds.

Because Cruise is a risk taker like
Maverick, this type of harsh criticism
is not new to him. In his other cur-
rent release, Legend, Cruise has even
been criticized for taking the role in
the first place. As forest creature Jack
0’ Green, Cruise spent much of his

time talking to a blank screen where ,
director Ridvley. Scott (Top Gunﬂtfecé,  
tor Tony "Scott's brother) would paste, ._ 
in the €,_leCU'0{}_'l:C gimgages of the—ot_her§, T
creatures. Praised for its visual ap’-' T

peal, the movie has been hit hard by.
every critic for its lack of ’a story. This
doesn't seem to change Cruises’s
opinion about doing the project.

_"’ln choosing a film,.when l look

at it — and I knew exactly what l was
getting into with Legend — I am go-
ing to take risks,” Cruise commented.
’’I want everyone to like my movies
and get great notices, but that can't
be the reason for doing a film.”

For whatever reason he chooses,
once involved in a picture, Cruise
throws himself entirely into his role.
He spent numerous hours living
among the top-gun students and in-
structors absorbing what it is to be a
pilot. He came away with »a
framework. for his character, a few
good pilot tales and a backseat ride
in an F-14. V

Not all his experiences on the Top _

Cun set were quite so enjoyable.
While shooting the carrier scenes on
the U.S.S. Enterprise, Cruise learned
very quickly that the Navy is not an
adventure. ”Prison with the threat of
drowning” Cruise quipped.

Even in his third film this year, The
Color of Money — a Martin Scorsese
and Paul Newman produced sequel
to The Hustler — Cruise had to
buckle down with the books. This
time it was learning to play pool,

which Cruise had never done. The P

result of his effort is the satisfaction
that every shot that this character,
Vincent, makes was done by Cruise.
The film is climaxed by an unedited
scene where Cruise runs the table.

With this deep dedication to his
craft, it is easy to see why Cruise has

made it to the upper realm of star- L P

cfom,‘ but it; seems as though there is

. more to it-,tha__n .that.'7 V  .

'’’Why are you such a success,”
someone asked. Cruise paused for a
moment and then quietly said: ’’I
guess because there is no bullshit
with me.” -

Peter Gabriel: ”Sledgehammer”

Gabriel hits hard with waves of
funk, a guitar riff reminiscent of
Bowie’s ”Fame” and expressive
sledgehammer—style lyrics in his most
commercial attempt to date.

A tangle of relentless tension,
”Sledgehammer” bursts with an in-
ternalized nervous energy that is
never unleashed. This strength can
also be seen as a weakness. The song
seems locked in gear for all of its four-
minute-and—58-second existence,

" leaving this listener in anticipation of

a nonexisternt climax and a bit bored.

Journey: ”Be Good to Yourself”

This dull and lifeless dinosaur dirge
epitomizes the type of trashtones
we've come to expect from these
guys. This is gar—bij defined.

brutal vocal attack. Play loudly at any

The Bolshoi: Ciants (EP)

There is an infinite number of
young groups around today Xeroxing
the U2 sound, but those that do it

‘ well could easily be written out by

hand. The Bolshoi represent a bland
and uninteresting incorporation of
the standard U2 bag of tricks that is
paper—thin on originality.

in the City of Brotherly Love? The
Dead Milkmen, of course. Last Thurs-
day, this sonically underwhelming
but emotionally overpowering Phil-'
ly quartet amused and electrified a
wall-to-wall Decade crowd with a
two hour—forty minute song set.
About half of the songs appear on the
band's debut LP, Big Lizard in my
Backyard. Included in the show was
everything from an attack on the
”right wing pigeon” that lives on
Pennsylvania Avenue, to lead singer
Rodney Anonymous’ attempt to
establish a church for the worship of
B—actor and ”Tonight Show” guest
Charles Nelson Reilly.

In between sets, the jukebox juror
and I held court with the Milkmen.
As we sucked in the foul south
Oakland air, the band confided that
their overriding ambition is to avoid

‘employment at 7-11; this band in-
tends to’ thrash and whine until they
drop dead. The Dead Milkmen are

 

also practical. Bassist Dave Blood
always wears black. While your
friendly neighborhood hardcore
metal head may have adopted the
color to instill fear or attract bikers,
Blood wears black for another
reason. It doesn't get dirty.

Major labels take note: The Dead
Milkmen are apparently a joy to have .
on your payroll. According to Blood,
relations with the president of Fever
Records are completely harmonious.
In fact, the band was rewarded for the
college radio success of ”Bitchin’
Camaro” by receiving chocolate
bars. Now that's gratitude.

You can look for the follow-up to
Big Lizard in my Backyard in your
record shop on July 25. If you don't,
it will probably look for you.

 
Why not get involved with something worthwhile?

Lou Reed: the feel of Velvet

J.P. Presley

For The Pitt News

I am ashamed. How could I have
ignored the rich soul catalog that
Atlantic has compiled since 1947?
And I've still only sampled one

volume of the seven volume Atlan- .

tic R&B. Volume VI documents the
era from 1966 to 1969 andincludes
incendiary performances from
Wilson Pickett, Otis Redding and

Aretha Franklin, who alone is worth

the price of admission. The ”Queen
of Soul” pleads, scolds and growls on
hits like ”Respect,” ”Think ” and
”Chain of Fools,’’ proving why she
was the greatest soul vocalist of her
era.

Chances are you've never been
blown away by a King Curtis sax at-
tack. Curtis appears here not only as
the leader of his own band, but as an
Atlantic session ace appearing on
several hits, including his sax-vocal
duel with Aretha on ”Respect.”
Unless you've seen Pretty in Pink,
you've probably never been touched
by the stylistic grace of Otis Redding.
Redding’s ”Try a Little Tenderness"
was featured in the scene where Jon
Cryer serenaded Molly Ringwald in
the record store. Otis may have been
the most gifted male vocalist of his
time (only Jackie Wilson and "Sam
Cooke could compare) and several of
his classics are at the core of Atlan-
tic R&B. Included is his only number
one pop hit, ”Dock of the Bay,”
which was released shortly after his
death in a 1967 airplane crash.

Although Motown has received the
lion's share of the 19605 soul ‘au-

The Divinyls: ”Pleasure and Pain”

These beer—swilling, pouch—be||ied
dingos (as Larry Bud Melman would
say) from down under could put a
damper on even the liveliest
kangaroo dance with this painfully
unpleasant bore of a song. The
Divinyls rely heartily on lead singer
Christina Amphlett’s vocals to keep
the song interesting. Sorry gang, LuLu'
couldn't have saved this one.

Lou Reed: ”No Money Down”

Reed breaks no new ground on
”No Money Down.” This is OK
though, the Velvet Underground took
care of the ground-breaking aspect of
his career. Reed, a happening cat,
blends a simple melody and
thoughtful lyrics in a fashion typical
of his recent recordings.

An Atlantic soul stew

dience‘ in recent years, Atlantic R&B
should help to correct the situation.
This is soul music at its best: bold,
raw and cocky. It also has some
moments of beautifully reflexive
balladry. Just listen to Aretha’s ver-
sion of ”You Make Me Feel Like A
Natural Woman,” an unbelievably
intense reading of the Carole King-
Gerry Coffin classic.

The sound of Atlantic R&B’s
timeless collection of 455 has been
revived by digital remastering. Who I
needs it? Take me back to 1966 and
play this album through a pair of
dime store speakers that sound like
amplified shoe boxes. This is the
ultimate party album. If you have a
taste for great music, sample this tasty
soul stew while you still can.

Floral fiend invades Pittsburgh Playhouse

David Zuchowski

Staff Writer

It's with a true sense of trepidation
that a theater buff, or perhaps devotee
is a better word, like myself recom-
mends going to a play to see its
special effects. But such is the case
with the Pittsburgh Playhouse pro-
duction of Little Shop of Horrors,
which spotlights an extraterrestrial
hip-talking carniverous plant that
"grows” from a mere sapling in the
first scene to a gigantic, tentacled
monster by the end of the night. The
voracious, rotted maneater, resem-
bling a giant papaya with teeth, not
only talks, but also moves with the
assistance of puppeteers Holly
Koenig and Kurt Carley.

Our somewhat likeable but dead-
ly monster, named Audrey ll,
somehow makes its way into a skid
row florist shop owned by an ex-

ploitative Munchkin named‘

Muchnik, played ably by Richard
Rauh. While there, Twoey, a pet
name for Audrey II, is nurtured by
mild mannered Seymour, played by
Tom Rocco. Seymour uses and is
used by the toothed, floral fiend to
gain media attention and publicity.
This sudden surge of notoriety raises
the shop to an unprecedented height
of prosperity. Poor, hapless Seymour
has a crush on one of his co-workers,
Audrey, after whom he names the

2.

PARTMENTS

plant. The human Audrey is played
by Linda Gabler, who looks and acts
like Marilyn Monroe, talks like Betty
Boop and sings like Florence
Nightengale, or perhaps, a Florentine
nightengale.

Without giving away any more of
the plot, or the spectacular ending,
I can say that this spoof on horror
stories has all the terror of a newborn
koala bear. But then this romping
musical comedy was never intended
to frighten its audience, merely to
entertain and delight.

To extol the special effects is not
to demean the production, which has
merit in and of itself. The play has a
strong plot punctuated by a spright-
ly, toe-tapping musical score. Each
scene dovetails swiftly and smoothly,
thanks to the commendable staging
of Edie Cowan, who choreographed
the original New York production.
The costumes and scenery were a
visual delight. The backup vocals by
a trio of comely lasses, named
Crystal, Ronette and Chiffon (echoes
of the '60s), functioned as a pop ver-
sion of a Greek chorus and added a
crowning touch to the evening's
pleasure.

Little Shop of Horrors, now play-
ing at the Rockwell Theatre at the
Pittsburgh Playhouse in Oakland,
continues Wednesday through Sun-
day night at 8:00 with a 2:00 p.m.
Sunday matinee through June 1.

True Confessions: Not neces

MOSTLY TRUE CONFESSIONS
BY lean Gonick
Random House

Gina Catanzarite
For The Pitt News

Imagine yourself in a situation in-
volving a relationship  any situa-
tion. Chances are Jean Gonick has
commented on it in her first book,
Mostly True Confessions: Looking for
Love in the 80's.

Mostly True Confessions is a col-
lection of some of the essays which
appeared monthly in Ms. Gonick’s
San Francisco-based column of the
same name. The book's 28 essays are
divided into four sections: ”Look-
ing,” ”Together,” ”Breaking Up”
and ”Alone.” There's something for
everyone.

Ms. Gonick reaches a wide au-
dience by experimenting with dif-
ferent grammatical tenses and points

of view. It's daring for a writer to at-
tempt a first-person voice of the op-
posite sex or even a third-person om-
niscient view of a lead, opposite-sex
character. In fact, she applies so
many different techniques that I
sometimes had to reread an essay
after clearing my head of the
technique previously used. In fact the
essays often read better the second
time.

The book's efforts are those done

in first person from a female point of
view. They're the most believable
because they read like actual exerpts
from the diary of a woman who tru-
ly is looking for love in the '80s.
‘ Gonick offers dozens of per-
sonalities to illustrate her scenarios,
and if you don't recognize at least a
few of them, you probably don't get
much out of the work.

Do these situations ring familiar:
three women mourning the deaths of

4.

recent relationships; or a live-in male
mate miffed by his lady's obsession
with the telephone? In fact, some of
the situations are almost too
recognizable, with yuppie overtones
so strong that I almost wanted to
reread some chapters over mesquite-
grilled swordfish or barbequed
oysters. While yuppie love is, not
always universal, you'll still feel com-
fortable reading about these
situations.

If Gonick’s book isn't riveting, it is
at least amusing. I took pleasure in
the reinforcement of the idea that
dating is a touch-and-go sport. It
reminds us that even if relationships
don't always leave US in dignity, they
do leave us with some darned good
anecdotes! Gonick tosses in some
witty commentary. The author in-
quires for example, ”If sex were
abolished, would there be contact
lenses?” She then compares a

On the flip side, however,
Gonick’s scenarios don't always end
with the happy couple riding into the
sunset. In fact, the ending observa-
tions, rather than being wry and tren-
chant, frequently border on
hyprocrisy. In some cases’ they are

just plainly depressing. From what _

appeared on the surface to be futile
with just a little more effort some sort
of universal truth could have e-
merged. As is, the essays usually
carry through what was originally
promised, but the endings don't have
the impact to move the book from
good to great.

Overall, Mostly True Confessions
is a kind of fast, easily-read book for
summer.

Evans tells of players, plans andpromises

John Enright

Assistant Sports Editor

Editor's note: On March 26,
Paul Evans was named the new head
basketball coach at the University of
Pittsburgh, relpacing Dr. Roy Chip-
man. Evans, who guided the Naval
Academy to a 30-5 record and a suc-
cessful NCAA tournament ap-
pearance this past season, has been
called on to resurrect a troubled pro-
gram — one whose members have
had high aspirations the past three
years, but only minimal success on
the court. Last week, I found Evans
in his office, and we discussed the
current status of the Panther basket-
ball program.

Q: A big question on everyone’s
mind is the status of power forward
Charles Smith. Do you plan to play
him at the center position next
season?

A: He's probably going to play
both forward and center. It depends
on what happens with Herb Barthol
[Pitt's 6-1 1 recruit from Parma, Ohio,
whose academic status is ques-
tionable]. If Barthol can play center
as a freshman, Charles will play
center a little bit; but if Barthol can't
play as a freshman, Charles will play
center even more. I think Tico
Cooper is probably a better player
than he showed last season.

Q: You've said in the past that
Carles could be a great player, but_
how do you feel about Demetreus
Gore, Pitt's leading scoreer in
1984-85?

A: I think he can be a great player
also. He has to become a little more
disciplined, learn the difference be-
tween a good shot and a bad shot,
and get some consistency in his
game.

Q: Speaking of discipline, do you
feel the so-called ”lack of discipline”
on last year's Panther team was
overblown by the fans and the
media?

A: It could have been. I'm not sure
how bad it was. I think when things
go bad, everybody is looking for an
excuse. But from what I have seen of
the players, they're super kids; I can't
see discipline being a problem.

Q: What changes will be evident
in Pitt's style of play?

A: We will run more and be more
involved in the transition game.
You're not going to see any motion

Q: Defensively?

A: You won't see and 1-3-1
defense, because it's not what I like
to teach. Obviously, we'll play more
man-to-man defense than we did at
Navy, simply because we have some
athletes who can do it.

Our zone defense will depend on
the situation. We'll play some zone
because the opponent's zone offense
isn't that good and because we can
run better out of it.

”We will run more and be
more involved in the tran-

‘ sition game. You're not go-

ing to see any motion of-
fense. The kids are going to
know what to do and where
they are supposed to be on
the court, plus they will
know who is supposed to
take the shots.”

— Paul Evans

offense. The kids are going to know
what to do and where they are sup-
posed to be on the court, plus they
will know who is supposed to take
the shots. Also, we'll try and bang the
ball inside.

Q: Overall, what are your team's
strengths?

A: We have pretty good
quickness, and two or three real good
players. I think we have some good
rebounders. What could be a prob-
lem, though, is that Demetreus and
Curtis may be at the same spot [off-
guard], or Demetreus and Jerome
Lane could be at the same position
[small forward]. So I'm not sure there
is a way to get all three kids on the
floor at the same time, especially if
Curtis plays off-guard.

Athletes join Pitt ranks

With the Pitt sports seasons wind-
ing down, a lot of coaches have been
on the road getting ready for next
season. Here are some of the new
names that will appear on Pitt rosters:

Women's Basketball: In addition to
the earlier signings of Lorri Johnson
of New Castle and Jenny Shingler of
Altoona, Kirk Bruce has signed Karen
Threatt from St. Anthony's High
School in Jersey City, N.J. Threatt, a
5-7 guard, was named second-team
All-League in Hudson County. Her
‘team was the southern division coun-
ty champions her senior year. She
averaged 12 points per game and
eight assists.

Soccer: Joe Luxbacher has been
busy in the area, signing four local
recruits to play for the Panthers next
season. A pair ofTrinity High School
players, Brian Hammond and Scott
Armstrong, will be coming in. Ham-
mond, a four-year starter, was All-
State as a midfielder, named All-
WPIAL and played on the state cham-
pionship team. Armstrong, a mid-
fielder and defender, was also named
All-WPIAL. Along with Hammond,
he played in the Dapper Dan Classic.
Jim Bottomley, a striker from Fox

Chapel High School, will be a strong
addition to the Panthers. Bottomley
was the leading scorer at Fox Chapel
and is the number one ranked player
in the area. Bob Smetak, a defender
from Norwin High School, is also an
All-WPIAL selection. Smetak is con-
sidered one of the top defenders in
the WPIAL.

Men's Swimming: The latest addi-
tion for the Panthers is Andrew
Dabrowski from North Penn High
School. Dabrowski is a high school
All-America in the 200-yard medley
relay.

Women's Swimming: The Lady
Panthers will also get a real boost
from some local talent. Sandy
Albright from South Park will add
strength in the 100-yard backstroke.
Albright was a PIAA and a WPIAL
champ. Pam Murphy of North
Allegheny was a runner-up at the
PIAA Swimming Championships in
the 100-yard butterfly. She was also
a finalist in the 500-y_ard freestyle.
Two other additions are Laure
Walczak of East Allegheny, who
specializes in the 50- and 100-yard
freestyle, and Candy Yackmack, a
diver from Kittaning.

Q: How do the departures of
Walter Berry and Pearl Washington
affect next year's Big East race?

A: I don't think it changes a whole
lot. Syracuse and St. John's are both
tradition schools, where somebody is
always going to come in and be just
as good as a player that leaves. lfyou

look at St. John's a year ago,
everybody said they would be lousy,
losing Chris Mullin and Bill Wen-
nington. But they came back and
were just as good, if not better, this
past season. And, of course, Syracuse

‘had one of the best recruiting years

in the country.

Q: Do you think a lot of players
will be affected by Proposition 48,
the new academic guidelines which
determine freshmen eligibility?

A: I would think there would be,
but when you have kids who haven't
passed a course in three years and
they come up with 9805 on the SAT,
obviously someone is taking their
tests. There are going to be some peo-
ple that probably haven't done it the
right way and yet still play.

Q: How do you feel about mov-
ing more Big East conference games
to the Civic Arean?

A: I think we're willing to move
two or three conference games there.
Eventually if we could get a full
house every night at the arena, it
wouldn't bother me to move all our
home games down there. But if we
can only get seven or eight thousand
people, then it isn't worth it.

Q: Will it be a big adjustment for
yourself coming to Pitt from Navy,
and for the players who must adapt
to a new coach?

Bill Callahan (above) is one of seven Pitt Panthers
either drafted or signed as free agents by NFL teams.

Inside Today

Redmen beat the Friars for the Big East

The

A: I don't think it will be a big ad-
justment for myself. For them, no
matter who the new coach is, there
is always going to be some adjust-
ment. It’s a different system, and I ex-
pect different things from them. But
I think most of the players are ready
for a change.

Q: Who will be your starting
point guard next season?

A: At this point it would be Mike
Goodson or Jimmy Rodgers [a 6-1
junior-college player from Georgia
who signed with Pitt a month ago].
I had thought about moving Curtis
Aiken back there until the three-point
rule was adopted. Although, depend-
ing on what happens in practice, Cur-
tis may have to be prepared to play
the point.

Q: Could you describe your.

coaching philosophy?

A: I like to play up-tempo and
stress the fundamentals more than
anything. I really stress getting the
ball inside and doing the basic, sim-
ple things right. I like to take advan-
tage of what the defense is giving
you, not going out and doing
something just for the sake of doing
it.

Q: Is the academic committment
strong at the university?

A: I think so.’Pitt has a great sup-
port system, and they do well by the
student-athletes with the trimester
and extra tutoring. And I feel the kids
respect that.

Seven
Panthers

to play pro

Of the nine starters lost from the
1985 Panthers football team, seven
will join the NFL. In addition to
defensive tackle Bob Buczkowski,
the first round choice of the Los
Angeles Raiders, and safety Bill
Callahan, a fourth round selection by
the Pittsburgh Steelers, five recently
signed as free agents.

Offensive tackle Tony Brown from
Stamford, Conn., signed with the
New England Patriots, offensive
guard Mike Dorundo from Yukon
signed with the Miami Dolphins,
center Barry Pettyjohn from Cincin-
nati, Ohio, went with the Tampa Bay
Buccaneers, fullback Darnell Stone
from West Elizabeth signed with the
Denver Broncos and tight end Clint
Wilson from Pahokee, Fla., signed
with the Cleveland Browns.

 

Additionally, two Panther basket-
ball players will try out as free agents.
Darryl Shepherd, a 6-5 fonrvard from
Peabody, signed with the Atlanta

Falcons and will be tried as a
receiver/defensive back and Keith
Armstrong, a 6-9 center from Ypsilan-
ti, Mich., signed with the Cincinnati

. Bengals and will try out as a defen-

sive lineman.

Things have slowed down con-
siderably at the University of Pitts-
burgh since the end of the winter
semester, but the pros keep playing
(and p|ay—offing) right along into
summer.

The NBAigets back into action
tonight. The upstart Houston Rockets
are visiting the defending world
champion Los Angeles Lakers. The
Rockets hold a 3-1 lead in the best
of seven series. Of course, a win
tonight would put them into the
championship series against the

 

Boston Celtics. That's the reward for
beating the Lakers? Almost not even
worth it. The Celtics look unstop-
pable this spring. Boston has lost only
one playoff game — to Atlanta in the
second round —- on their way to the
finals. The Celts wrapped up their
Semi—final series with Milwaukee on
Sunday with a 111-98 win at the
Mecca.

The NHL is already in the midst of
its championship series pitting the
Montreal Canadians against the
Calgary Flames.

Big East roundup: baseball awards

PROVIDENCE COLLEGE — PC
baseball players captured seven 1986
Big East Conference individual
baseball awards including Player of
the Year, Roger Haggerty; Pitcher of
the Year, Jim Navilliat; and Coach of
the Year, Don Mezzanotte. In addi-
tion, Haggerty and Navilliat were two
of four Friars to be named to the All-
Conference squad.

The selections were announced at
a banquet at the Chippanee Country
Club in Bristol, Conn., where the
conference baseball championships
will be conducted May 15-18 at
Muzzy Field. The winning team in
the double elimination tournament
will receive an automatic berth in the
1986 NCAA Division I championship.

Haggerty led the Big East with a
.500 batting average and a record 26
runs batted in. The senior third
baseman also had a slugging percent-
age of .938. I

Navilliat led all Big East starters in
earned run average at 1.45 and won
all five of his starts, including a one-
hitter and a five-hit shutout.

Mezzanotte led the Friars to their
first ever North division title with 10
wins in the final 13 conference
games and an 11-7 mark for the
season.

Joining Haggerty and Navilliat on
the all-conference team are team-
mates Jerry Carroll and Paul Rizzo,.
Rizzo, a shortstop, earned the honor
for the second consecutive year,
while Carroll, an outfielder, set con-
ference records for doubles (10) and
total bases (61).

The PC baseball team was not the
only Friar squad making news this
week. Head basketball coach Rick
Pitino has confirmed the names of
those student-athletes who have
signed National Letters of Intent and
who plan to enroll at Providence this
autumn.

 

The players are, in alphabetical
order:

James Best, Portsmouth High/Unr-
versity of New Hampshire, Ports-
mouth, NH. A transfer from the
University of New Hampshire, Best
led his high school team to the state
championship in 1984. He averaged
10.7 points per game and shot 49

I percent from the field during his one

year at UNH.

Delray Brooks, University of In-
diana, Michigan City, IN. Brooks
played under Indiana head coach
Bobby Knight before deciding to
transfer to Providence. Brooks was a
Hoosier for a year and a half. Dur-
ing his freshman year, Delray started
12 games and played in 32, averag-
ing 3.6 points and ranking fourth on
the team with 53 assists, third wllth

19 steats. This past season the -6-4__‘ L i

first Friar signed last fall. Conlon
averaged 22 ppg as a senior.

Carlton Screen, Xaverian High
School, Brooklyn, N.Y. Leading
scorer in the CHSCA with a 24.5 per
game average, Carlton was recently
named to the league's all-star team.
The 5-11, 160-pounder is considered
a very smart player with good pass-
ing ability. He is a member of the
New York Daily News and New York
Post All-Star teams. Carlton is ex-
pected to play point guard for the
Friars.

Abdul Shamsid-Deen, Tottenville
High School, Staten Island, N.Y. He
has played organized ball for only
two years. He is a 6-10 forward who
is mobile, quick and a good shooter
for a big man. ”Abdul has unlimited
potential in all phases of the game,”
Pitino said.

 

VILLANOVA— Winding up its spring
practice with a Blue-White intra-
squad scrimmage, Vi|lanova’s of-
fense, behind impressive showings
by freshman redshirt quarterback Kirk
Shultz (Mahwah, N.J.) and
sophomore running back Art Con-
dodina (Broomall, Pa.), posted a
39-28 victory over the Wildcat
defense.

’’Overall, I was very pleased with
our offense,” commented second
year Wildcat football mentor, Andy
Talley. ”The offense moved the ball
very well, in fact I was a little sur-
prised by its showing. The offensive
line was really coming off the ball
and the offense as a whole really ex-
ecuted.”

Making an especially impressive
performance was quarterback Kirk
Schulz who finished the day com-
pleting 11 of 14 passes, while throw-
ing -for 127-yards, one TD and hav-
ing one pass intercepted. Also look-
ing strong for the ’Cat offense was
sophomore running back Art Con-
dodina who carried the ball nine
times for 71 yards and two TDs.
Leading VU’s receiving corps were
sophomore tight end Jim Cashman
(King of Prussia, Pa.) who caught five
passes for 54 yards, and redshirt
freshman Robert Brady (Bloom-
ington, III.) who grabbed four passes

ing form he showed on the field in
1985 was senior punter George
Winslow (Philadelphia, Pa.) who
punted three times for a hefty 48.0

tackle John O'Brien (Wood Ridge,

recovered a fumble, while John
McGowan (Holland, Pa.) intercepted ’_
one pass. r

We cannot appreciate the
freedoms we now enjoy
without honoring the brave
men and women who gave
up their lives defending our
nation. Throughout history,
the courageous people of
our armed forces stood ready
to fight and die, so that
democracy might live on.
Let us never forget them.
