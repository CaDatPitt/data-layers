Housel Selected
I-F Council Head

For Coming Year

Delta Tau Representative Chosen
On Compromise Platform Due
To Rules Misunderstanding

William Housel, C37, Delta Tau
Delta, will be president of Interfrater-
nity Council for the coming year.

This was decided at the ﬁrst meet-
ing of the new council at the Phi
Gamma Delta house Tuesday. Other
oﬂicers will be Hary Zinsser, Med39,
Sigma Chi, vice president; Samuel
_Andersoii, BA37, Phi Delta Theta,
secretary; Harold Byers, C38, Theta
Chi, treasurer; and Alex Willson, C38,
Lambda Chi Alpha, ﬁfth member of
the executive committee.

No regular interfraternity election
was held this year, following misun-
derstandings as to the election pro-
cedure to be used. Instead, a com-
promise platform, in which all
fraternities are to be dealt with equit-
ably was agreed upon by all members
of Council. This agreement, approved
two weeks ago by the Men’s Frater-
nity committee, waived the necessity
for a regular election. The ﬁve of-
ﬁcers were the only men nominated
for these positions. \

Appointm.ents Made

According to N. Robert Seidle, as-
sistant to the dean of men and fra-
ternity adviser, this agreement by- I-F
Council should make for a better un-
derstanding and more harmonious
carrying out of the duties with which
the council will be faced. It is_ her-
alded as at least a partial removal of
politics from interfaternity activities,
and though merely a tentative ar-
rangement, should have much to do
with the improvement of friendly
fraternity relations.

Appointments made by the new ex-
ecutive committee yesterday, in ac-
cordance with the agreement, include:
rushing cliairman—at-large, Raymond
Scheib, C37, Phi Kappa; Howard
Schweppe, C37, Sigma Alpha Epsilon,
interfraternity conference chairman;
chairmen of athletics, William Gross-
cope, C37, Phi Delta Theta, and Wil-
liam McClain, M38, Sigma Alpha Ep-
silon; Stanley Rogaliner, BA37, will
edit the Interfraternity.Handbook. Ap-
pointments to the three interfraternity
dance chairmanships will be made as
the time for the affairs approaches. ~

Investigate Hell Week

Upon repeated recommendation of
Seidle, President Housel appointed a
committee to investigate and report
upon the possibility of partial or com-
plete elimination of fraternity “Hell
Week” in the fraternities which are
members of council. The committee is
also to look into the matter of physical
violence as used in initiation and
pledge training, and to discover, if
any such examples exist, how they
may be eliminated. Hubert Teitel-
baum, C37, Phi Epsilon Pi, will head
the committee which includes Ben
Baskin, C37, Sigma Alpha Mu; Don-
ald Pritchard, C37, Delta Tau Delta;
and Charles Manterﬁeld, C37, Theta
Chi.

No action was taken toward repair-
ing or replacing the broken down
election system which was used last
year, and a proposal by Teitelbaum to
include the ﬁfth member of the ex-
ecutive committee on the Meii’s Fra-
ternity Committee was tabled as re-
quiring a constitutional amendment.

In a.ccordance with the action of the
Men’s Fraternity Committee, Sigma
Chi was removed from probation when
it was revealed that an error in the
compiling of their scholarship aver-
age caused them to drop below .75.
According to Zinsser, Sigma Chi pres-
ident, two ineligible brothers had their
grades included in the ﬁrst ofﬁcial
rating. .

Housel, at this writing, had not de-
cided whether a special Council meet-
ing would be called this semester. If
it is, it will be held some time within
the next two weeks at the Phi Kappa
house; ,

orary members Wednesday evening at

Dr. Hugh Thomson’ Kerr, pastor of
the Shadyside Presbyterian Church,
main speaker at the banquet, spoke
on “Educational Freedom.” Having
just returned from a trip around the
world, Dr. Kerr discussed educational
policies in foreign lands and stressed
the admiration which foreign educa-
tors have for American colleges be-
cause they are. free from state con-:
trol. A

In elongating his statement that it
is not Pittsburgh’s steel mills but-
Pittsburgh’s Cathedral of Learning
attention in many
foreign groups, Dr. Kerr quoted ,a..
Hindu educator as remarking, “The:
Cathedral! What an admirable sym-
bol of spirituality in learning!” ‘

at the ceremony, presided over by
President Russell Connolly, C36, were
John Adams, Charles Allcroft, Albert‘.
Barr, Eugene Cohen, Ha.rold Connelly,

Board Continues
With Interviews

Will Announce New Appointees,

-115

Interviews with prospective staff
heads of the major publications of
the University are still _being held‘ by
the Publication Board.

According to Theodore W. Biddle,
assistant to the dean of men and a
member of the board, the. applicants
interviewed so far have shown such
excellent possibilities that a choice

will be difﬁcult. Only about 10 of
the 23 candidates will receive posi-
tions.

“They have shown themselves to
be so well-informed and full of ideas
that the work is progressing much
slower than we had expected,” Mr.
Biddle said. Original plans were to
complete the interviews Monday, Tues-
day and Thursday of this week, but
extensive conferences by the board
last Monday with present editors and
business managers for recommenda-
tions threw the appointment schedule
far behind. It is hoped that extra
sessions today and Monday will ﬁnish
up the interviews.

Announcements of the decisions of
-the board will probably be made at
the Publications Banquet, which will
be held soon. The decisions will be
based upon the opinions of Dr. Vin-
cent W. Lanfear, dean of men; Miss
Thyrsa W. Amos, dean of women;
Robert X. Graham, University News
Service head, and Mr. Biddle.

The successful candidates will as-
sume responsibility as soon as it is
deemed practical.

Radio Comedians Not F unny
In Real Life, Opines Editor

 

Commenting on many phases of
radio, ranging from television to gag-
men, Darrell V. Martin, radio editor
of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, an-
swered the questions of a good-sized
crowd Wednesday noon at Inquiry
Forum.

Mr. Martin ﬁrst pictured some of
the personalities in radio. “Radio peo-
ple,” he said, “don’t become famous
because they are especially good or
because they have ability.”

He then narrowed the ﬁeld to com-
edians. These entertainers he de-
scribed as “not funny at all in real
life. One man on the air,” he ex-
plained, “cannot be as funny as his
jokes suggest.” The reason for this,
according to Mr. Martin, is that al-
most all of the comedians do not
write their own jokes, leaving this
problem to paid “gag-men.” One novel
way of getting jokes, as he explained
it, is by the “brain trust.” In this
system, used by Ed Wynn, a group
of “gag-writers” get together, men-
tion ideas, associate jokes with those
ideas, until they have invented a col-
lection of funny stories.

Amos and Andy, who are the only
well—known artists writing their own
continuity, were unknown until a
sponsor presented them to the pub-
lie in a psychological manner, he
noted. “The psychology behind which
a program is presented,” he stated,
its suc-

cess.” “Many artists have lost pop-

ularity because their sponsors have
said that there was no one as good
as they.” .

The radio editor declared that most
radio stations do'not‘use censorship,
but that since a recent Supreme Court
decision holding a station responsible
for slanderous -remarks made over it,
the regulations have been made more
strict. “It’s very poor business,” ‘-1176
commented, “to let anyone get before
a microphone and say what he thinks.”

“Television is here," he said. “It
is ready for the home as soon as the
people who control it think that we
can pay them a fair price. Television,
like any other progressive movement,
will improve the movies and help busi-
ness.”

“Thank God when it does come,”
he continued. “we won't have so
much trash fed to us from Hollywood.
We will have to have quality. The
fantastic ideas of Hollywood will have
to come down to earth.”

Going into another phase of radio,
he opined that “education by radio
has great possibilities. But,” he de-
clared, “radio is not an educating
force in itself. It is an educating
force only when it is combined and
coordinated with other things.”

He declared himself in favor of the
radio system in this country, as
against the government-ownership in
effect in most European nations. “Pro-
grams that the government-controlled
systems put on the air,” he observed,
“can’t compare with ours."

,_ Whither Appropriations ?

HEN GOVERNOR EARLE at the ODK initiation
Wednesday repeated and clariﬁed his stand against
the University administration, he made some statements
which should cause"even“the most indifferent of students
to sit up and take notice. In threatening again to elim-
inate the University’s appropriation, he promised to use
this money in caring for Universi-ty students who could
not return to Pitt if they lose their scholarships, by
sending them to Temple, Penn, or Penn State and even
paying their living expenses.
Whether or not the governor believes that this action

will remove all difﬁculties from the students of the Uni-
versity and place the hardships where he apparently
thinks they belong is not a matter of record. But he
should realize that if Pitt should lose its appropriation,
a great deal more would be lost than gained. The fac-
ulty staif would have to be cut considerably, University
activities would have to be curtailed, and the curricula
would have to be restricted to some extent. It is ex-
tremely vital both to the citizens of Pittsburgh and the
students and members of the faculty of the Univer-
sity that none of these things should happen. There-
fore the governor should realize that a cut or elimination
of appropriations would do great harm not only to his
new-found foes but also to a great many innocent, and
interested people, and even, politically, to himself.

Nevertheless his request that more alumni be placed
upon the Board of Trustees seems not unreasonable, al-
though not, perhaps, so important as he has made it ap-
pear. After all, the alumni have many times gone on
record as backing unequivocallv any actions of the
Chancellor, and in the recent election, conservative can-
didates were elected without a shadow of a doubt.

If then, as it appears, the governor's motive is merely
to reduce the admitted conservatism of the Board of
Trustees, he has gone about it in entirely the Wrong way
by approaching it from the appropriations and alumni
angle. But if the governor, as has been alleged, is at-
tempting to introduce the element of politics into Uni-
versity affairs, and to use the ensuing victory as a rung
in his political ladder, then he must necessarily be
condemned. But in any case, if by this dispute, justiﬁed
as it may be, harm might be done to the students and
faculty of the University, then, either by compromise or
by some sort of an equitable agreement, Governor Earle
and Dr. Bowman must come to terms.-—-H. R.

Cribbing

ROM QUESTIONNAIRES prepared by the Committee

on the Improvement of Teaching and passed out to
students of various classes this week, We learn that:
“Certain instructors and students believe that there is a
considerable amount of dishonesty in examinations at
the University, while others hold that there is very little.
All agree that is is desirable to learn the facts, and to
this end we ask you to supply the following informa-
tion .” Questions on the prevalence of cribbing,
transfer of information, and the like follow. At the end
is a space for suggestions on correcting such practices.

The committee has brought to light a pertinent ques-
tion. Aside from the ethics involved, cribbing reﬂects
upon the educational system which not only permits it
but which encourages students to use it as a means to
secure at least the label, “good student,” or as a way
to prevent ﬁunking.

The anonymnity of the questionnaire suggests that the
answers will be truthful. Certainly, there is no advan-
tage in concealing information which would lead to
correction of grade-chasing as a step toward the obtain-
ing a real education rather than a useless veneer of one.

This is. of course, a presumption that the committee
will ﬁnd that such practices are prevalent and will at-
tempt to use the information it secures as a basis of re-
form other than the obvious method of stricter surveil-
lance while students are taking a test. Working merely
for 90 credits, 120 quality points, and a diploma, as the
present system permits, justifies the obviously “uneth-
ical” practice of cribbing.——L. K.

Student, F0 rmer
‘Amateur Hobo,’

Tou red 38 States

By Edwin H. Beachler

“It’s in the air, and it just gets, in
your blood.” Yes, at least, the north-
ern transients have been bitten once
more by a very common animal, the
“hobo Wanderlust.”

Here at the University, a former ad-
dict of his malady is quite certain he
has lost or subdued the roving spirit
that in former years held quite a
strangle-hold on his summer activity.

!However, there was a time when B.
Joseph Kurjack, C38, spent months at
a time on the road. It was in 1932,
following his graduation from Allen-
town High that “Barney,” as the boys
knew him, hopped his ﬁrst freight.
They had been hitch-hiking to Cali-
fornia, and were tipped off by a. mo-
torist that “riding the rails” was bet-
ter than thumbing.

So, that night Barney and his trav-
eling companion, August, a younger
brother, slipped up on a coupling be-
tween two freight cars and slept on
their ﬁrst freight bed that night. They
doubled up in a rough corner, of the
freight car, pulled papers over their
tired bodies, and settled down to the
roughest nap in their 20-odd years-

Visited ‘Hooverville’

From that ﬁrst hop, the two boys
moved on westward, and did hot hit
their ﬁrst “Hooverville” until two
nights later. Here, at Denver, Colo-
rado, they were initiated into then’
ﬁrst hobo camp. They were told by
“Slim’,” a short, shaggy-haired Slo-
vak, to remember that they could
always ﬁnd a camp near the railroads
by following the nearest path leading
to a clump of trees and a small creek.

In this ca.mp they saw “old knights
of the road" (they’re really hoboes)
ranging from the ages of three to 80.
At this point, too, they discovered that
the only traveling equipment of the
average “transient” was composed of
a toothbrush, soap, comb, razor, and
perhaps a small piece of mirror.

By that time, they were ﬁrmly con-
vinced that “freighting is the spice of
a good transient’s life,” so it was back
to the freight cars until they had trav-
eled through no less than 38 states.

Kurjack saw “Tex,” famed “king of
the Hoboes” on a passing freight as
he left Cheyenne, Wyoming, and
had time to wave a friendly “so-long.”
Eddie Barbey, Barney’s traveling
mate, was a close friend of the slim,
well-known hobo leader. From Eddie,
he learned that this was the “Tex”
whose autographed posters and paint.-
ings could be seen on so many station
houses through the mid-west.

Spent $15

During the ﬁrst summer of travel,
the two brothers spent exactly .315,
and were fearful all the time that un-
scrupulous men in the camps or on
the ca.rs would discover they carried
money with them.

From his ma.ny experiences with
“yard ofﬁcials” Kurjack has learned
that the best policy is “to act dumb
and timid at all times.” Another
thing he learned was that the long-
haul freights are ultimately faster
than short-haul trains.

At night‘s in the campﬁre “bull-
sessions,” singing, imitating, and stage
talent of all kinds “provides the hobo
camp with better entertainment than
you will ﬁnd in many small theaters,”
reported Kurjack. Perry McClain, a
Texan, was a favorite in a Chicago
camp. His animal imitations have
been heard in Europe, according to
the Pitt sophomore.

What are the modes of travel? Well,
if the train is loaded for a “haul,” the
boys travel either in a “reefer” or a
“tender.” The “reefer,” to the trans-
ient, is an empty ice-box in a refrig-
erator car. It will hold two sleepy
travelers comfortably. The “tender”
is the blind passage in the mail car,
hooked up behind the ﬁring room of
the passenger engine.

The latter can offer only speed,
smoke, cinders, and a rough seat for
the transient. But what transient
wants any of these, especially the
speed?

l Letter To The Editor

 

Editor, The Pitt News:

I was quite interested to read cer-
tain ﬁgures which were published by
your paper in its May 4 edition con-_
cerning the present average stay of
professors at this University as com-
pared with that of 1920. “An in-

crease of more than seven years—”
was discovered. This is indeed most
impressive. The conclusion seems to
be that the University is pursuing a
course of remarkable benevolence to-
ward its faculty. But, Mr. Editor, it
appears to me that your statistical de-
partment has been a little too suc-
cessful in proving the very thing it
started out to prove.

Consider a moment. Let us say
that here is a gentleman who is un-
deniably a profound. scholar and com-
petent teacher. Let us say, hypoth-
etically, that he is in the zoology de-
partment. He serves at the Univer-
sity for 20 years, shall we say. Now,
on the other hand, here is a man in
the history department, for instance.
He, too, is a scholar.‘ But for some
reason this professor is invited to
inhabit his chain for only four years,
let us say.

Now then, Mr. Editor, according to
these ﬁgures, the average term of
service is found to be 12 years, is
it not? But it does not express the
reality, does it? We have been taken
for a mathematical ride. We still
know only that one man was here
ﬁve times as long as the other and
any talk of averages is mere non-
sense. In other words, Mr. Editor,
(and this is the crux of the matter)
when the faculty mortality is con-
sidered to be localized in certain de-
partments (and is largely conﬁned to
the college) we cannot arrive at a

true estimate of faculty security by
“averaging in” the Medical School,
the Engineering School and the Alle-
gheny Observatory.

Furthermore, Mr. Editor, what is
the signiﬁcance of comparing the
service average of today with that of
1920? Let us assume that my ﬁgure
above of 12 years is sound and in-
dicative of present conditions. In 1920
the University was in a state of post-
war degeneracy. Students poured in
after the war‘ and found few doctor’s
degrees among the faculty. The teach-
ers were old and generally incom-
petent. In the years of that period
the administration was attempting to
effect a reorganization of its faculty
and rightly so. This was the general
situation in the years beford 1920.
Therefore, it your comparison
proves anything at all, it proves the
exact converse of what you intended,
namely: that the administration of
1920 was acting with greater justiﬁ-
cation and with a clearer regard for

the interests of its students than is-

the present administration!
However, be assured that I ﬁnd
much to commend in your attempt
to bring light upon a matter which
is causing the students and faculty
such grave concern.
ulty and students in the completest
bewilderment with regard to the pol-
icies of the administration, particu-
larly in matters relating to the fac-
ulty. The Chancellor makes no at-
tempt to win the conﬁdence and co-
operation of the students or the fac-
ulty as he leads them by forced
marches to the ‘promised land. If The
Pitt News can show us where this
sad campaign will end, I for one shall
be its staunchest advocate so long
as I breathe the air of this campus.

Alumni Election Recalls 1913
Selection O__f_B_o_ard Members

By John Martinco

The alumni voting, which resulted
this week iii the election of ‘Wilbur
D. Hockensmith and Norman Ma.c-
Leod to seats on the University Board
of Trustees by decisive margins, set
a precedent in University Alumni af-
fairs, according to John W. Hallock,
secretary of the General Alumni As-
sociation.

It was the ﬁrst time that the alum-

ni, as a whole, participated in a direct
election. However, it was not the ﬁrst
occasion that the graduates exercised
a voice in the selection of members
to the Board.

A copy of a letter in the alumni ﬁles
show that in 1913, Dr. S. B. Lin-
hart, secretary of the Board, sent a
message to G. M. P. Baird, then see-
retary of the General Alumni Associa-
tion, asking for the names of three
men qualiﬁed to ﬁll vacancies on the
Board.

Taking action on this request,
Alumni Council submitted for consid-
eration of the» Board, the names of
three men. Two of these were elect-
ed, A. R. Hamilton, who served until
his death in 1926, and C. W. Ridinger,
still serving as a trustee.

The present election was different,
in that it was undertaken not at the
request of the trustees but at the
wishes of the alumni. The Chancellor
and the Board were very receptive to
the plan for election drawn up by
Alumni Council, according to Mr. Hal-
lock, “A lot of people may think that
this was yielding to the Governor, but
we started this long before the Gov-
ernor ever started pressing the mat-
ter,” he stated.

A disappointingly small number of
ballots was returned in the voting.
Out of approximately 23,000 mailed

out to degree-holding alumni, only
about 4,000 came back marked. Some
of these had to be invalidated because
of improper marking, reducing the to-
tal number counted to 3,499.

Hockensmith and MacLeod, the win-
ning candidates polled 2,035 and 1,913
votes respectively. The other two
regular candidates, W. S. Rial and J.
R. Thompson, received 1,281 and 955
respectively. The progressive slate
made a poor showing, polling only
about ten per cent of the total number
of votes. State representative Al
Tronzo came out with 345, running
second on the “liberal” slate to su-
perintendent of County Airport, John
J. McLean, who received 356 votes.

The results of the vote have been
certiﬁed to 'Alumni Council, which
will report whether or not the elec-
tion was held in accordance with reg-
ulations at a meeting of the body May.
18. Formal announcement of the
names will be ma.de during commence-
ment week in June.

This year's election is the ﬁrst step
in the plan of electing six alumni
representatives to the Board. During
thenext two years four more wil1_be
selected in order to arrive at the ﬁnal
number of six members.

All-Americans, Band, Track Teams
Pepfprm In Double-Bill Tomorrow

Annual Varsity-Alumni
Grid Game Opened
To Spectators

The proverbial stick will be shaken
with gusto tomorrow afternoon on the
Stadium lot when carloads of All-
American football players, a gang of
brass from the University band, and
ﬂashing spikes pour into the Stadium
for the big “double-bill” of the spring
sports season.

Coach Bill Kern’s alumni all-stars,
captained by Dick Matesic, have 35
choice slabs of beef to put up on the
varsity chopping block at 3 o'clock in
the ﬁnale of the spring training foot-
ball session. It will mark the ﬁrst
time that the varsity—alumni game
has been opened to the public.

As in former years, the varsity en-
ters the game as favorites. Physical
condition, coordination, and coaching
will prove quite an obstacle for the
“old-timers” to hurdle.

“Biggie” Goldberg, sensation of the
past spring training drills, will be in
there at right half for the varsity, and
promises to attract plenty of atten-
tion before the close of the afternoon.

Greene At ‘Quarterback

Bob La Rue will hold down his reg-
ular position at the other halfback
post. Frank Patrick has ﬁnally edged
out Bill Stapulis, at least to start this
game, for the fullback assignment.
Husky Arnold Greene handles the sig-
nal-barking duties.

At the ends, Frank Souchak, of the
“Jimmy Thompson long-driving fame,”
teams up with Paul “Bomber” Shaw.
Two of the best defensive tackle
prospects in Pitt history, Tony Matisi
and George Delich, line up inside of
the ﬁankmen. Next to them are
“Biff” Glassford and Dante Dalle
Tezzi at the guards. Don Hensley
gets the snapper-back call.

“All-star” Coach Kern has at least
35 “X-men" from which to select a
starting line-up. It is probable that
Muggsy Skladany, former All-Ameri-
can end, will attempt to bust things
up in the varsity backﬁeld from his
position at left end. Harvey Booker,
the “Tarentum ﬁreman,” will attempt
to drag down a few himself.

Heller, Munjas To Start

“Bliinp" Hoel, 230-pound tackle, has
been shifted to a guard, and along
with Ken Ormiston should make
things plenty tough for the varsity
spinne-rs. Art Detzel and Stan Olej-
nczak, tackles, and Nick Kliskey will
ﬁll out the remainder of the forward
wall.

The backﬁeld will be “sick” in name
only when Mike Nicksick and Dick
Matesic monopolize the halfback
running positions. Miller Munjas will
boot ’em and call ’em at quarterback.
Warren Heller, All-American, takes
over the line-cracking job.

The second all-star line-up includes:
Ted Dailey and Bob Timmins, ends;
Tiger Walton and Jess Quatse,
tackles; Frank Kutz and Tar Onder,
guards; George Shotwell, center; Bob

Kern-al

ILL KERN, assistant football coach,

who tomorrow takes full command

of an army that did come back after

its wars-were over. Yes, his front-

line is battle-scarred and portly,

but they still have enough left to give
the “Youngsters" plenty of charges.

Linksmen Battle
Conference Foes

Meet Cornell Today, Penn State
Tomorrow At Ithaca, N. Y.

Determined to break into the vic-
tory column in the Eastern Intercol-
legiate Golf Conference, six Panther
linksmen were set to take on Cor-
nell’s outﬁt this afternoon and Penn
State’s sextet tomorrow afternoon at
Ithaca, New York.

Eight men were in the party that left

Pittsburgh yesterday morning for the P

two-da.y engagement. Those making
the trip were: Coach Art Snyder, Pat
Symonds, Frank Souchak, Jack Was-
co, Sam Musico, Bob Mease, Bob
Baughman and Manager Heinie Hass-

Although out of the running for the
section title, the Pitt boys hope to be
able to make amends for the show-
ing at Washington last week, when
they dropped three matches to con-
ference opponents.

Cornell and Penn ‘State are re-
ported to have two of the ﬁnest links’
teams in the East, and a triumph for
the Panthers would be‘ in the nature
of an upset.

Starts Same Team

Coach Snyder will use the same
lineup that started in the other con-
ference matches, with Symonds at No.
1, Souchak at No. 2‘, Wasco at No. 3,

.Musico.at No. 4, Mease at No. -5, and

Baughman at No. 6.

Souchak is the only member of
this group who boasts an undefeated
record in match play for the season.
The husky football end has disposed
of ﬁve topﬂight collegiate golfers in
as many matches, including Billy
Marks of Princeton.

The team will return home Sunday

 

Panther Runners Face
Nittany Lion Squad
In Dual Meet

Something seldom done in the sports
world is billed for the Stadium to-
morrow afternoon—a track meet as a
running mate to a football game.

The track meet has the Panther
runners meeting the Penn State track-
ers in the third dual meet of the sea-
son for the Pitt boys. At the same
time, the Panther frosh squad takes
on the Little Lions-

Starting at 12:30 o'clock with the
ﬁeld events, the Panther varsity will
try to make it ﬁve in a row over the
State team, having licked the Lion
outﬁt each year for the past four
years. Last season the Cats ran up
a one-sided 101-33 triumph.

This season the Panthers would be
the favorites again to whip the Nit-
taners except for the fact that neither
Art Thomas nor Andy Lasky will com-
pete in the meet, To date, the Pan-
thers have triumphed over Temple
and lost to Notre Dame.

The State team lost several of their
best men last year through graduation
but a number of exceptionally good
sophomores have popped up this sea-
son to take their place. Johns in
the dash events, Downey running the
440, Book the half-mile, and Olexy in
the two-mile, are the most dangerous
of the sophomores to threaten the
Pitt cause.

Something New.’
Cagers Go Union
In Spring Drills

VVho’d a thunk it? The spring prac-
tice bug that went around campus a
few weeks ago biting the footballers
and the basketballers has gone and
pulled a new one.

This time the little rascal has put
the bite onto Dr. Carlson to put his
cagers on “union shifts” during their
two-week sojourn with a basketball
on the Stadium football ﬁeld.

The other day after the bug had
done his duty, the doctor of basket-
ball looks his guys over, thinks they
need not be worked too hard — and
comes out with the new union rule.
The union rule only allows the cagers
to work out from 3:30 to 5 o'clock.

At the stroke of ﬁve, if a basketball
is ﬂying through the air towards one
of the short-wearing basketeers, the
basketeer promptly and nonchalantly
ducks it and sprints for the good ol’

O’Loughlin Netmen Chalk Up Third
Consecutive Victory In Bethany Match

Continuing their winning streak,
the Panther netmen copped their third
straight victory by overwhelming
Bethany, 9-0, on the Trees courts. To
date, the Panther racqueteers have
captured 26 games to the opposition’s
one.

Bob Madden, Pitt's singles cham-
pion, had no diﬂiculty in disposing of
Emerson Hess, Bethany’s lead-off
man, 6-2, 6-0.

Ralph Bald continued to goose-egg
all of his opposition this year by
sweeping Eddie Carson off his feet in
two love sets.

McElroy was no match for Captain
Joe Madden who trounced the Beth-
any netman, 6-2, 6-2.

Irvin Solow, the most improved var-
sity racqueteer, shellacked Fink, 6-2,
6-2. Sirg Cohn lost a 6-2, 6-1 match
to R0)’ Heckler.

In a freak match, Rowland Wilson
ﬁnally edged out Hunter Cully, 15-13,

6-4. As Cully rushed to the net early
in the first set, one of VVilson’s drives
“konked” him in the left eye. After
a little bit of impromptu ﬁrst aid, play
was resumed.

Madden and Bald, ace Panther dou-
bles combination, continued to sweep
aside all competition by trouncing
Hess and Cohn, 6-0, 6-1.

Carson and McElroy succumbed to
I-Ieckler and Captain Joe Madden in
straight sets.

The McKenna and Thompson dou-
ble duo clicked again to complete the
victory parade, out-stroking Erskine
and Fink, 6-1, 10-8.

Coach Dave O’Loughlin’s experi-
ments of concentrating team strength
in the doubles and singles instead of
relying on the six starting men to also
play doubles, have proved successful.
This will give the Panthers stronger
reserves in their quest for an unde-

feated season.
