THURSDAY, MARCH 3, ‘I988

UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH’

Past SGB

president
made break
a reality

By Erik Kridle
Staff Writer

Next week marks the first
spring break for Pitt students
since 1966, when Pitt became a
state-related school. However,
the quest for a break began in
1984 with Luke Kluchk0’s cam-
paign for Student Government
president.

”Whi|e [I was] running for SGB
president in November 1984,”
said Kluchko, who is presently a
graduate student studying inter-
national affairs, "I frequently used
the slogan ’Spring Break in '88.’
Little did I know then that I would
be directly involved in making
that a reality."

Soon after his election to Board
president, Kluchko met with Dr.
John R. Quatroche, secretary of
the university, at which time
Kluchko made known his interest
in having a spring break. Due to
Kluchko's apparent concern with
the issue, he was invited in May
of 1985 by former Provost Ben-
jamin to serve on the University
Calendar Review Committee.

Kluchko said, ”Our discussion
thus led to the possibility of read-
ing days, which at that time
weren't being enforced as such.
That is, many students were given
final exams during those two
days [Monday and Tuesday]/'
Kluchko added that students
were ”getting smashed” from Fri-
day until Monday and utilized lit-
tle of the prescribed time for
study.

”The registrar representative
said that ifwe eliminated reading
days, we could not only make
room for a break in the winter
term, but that could also attach an
extra day to the Thanksgiving
holiday. That seemed the best
possibility," said Kluchko.

To further the decision-making
process of the SGB’s ad—hoc com-
mittee, a survey was given on
campus in the fall of 1985 to de—
termine whether or not the stu-
dents favored a spring break.

Despite the fact that a majority
of students were not in favor of
giving up reading days during the
week, a stronger majority sup-
ported a break in the winter term.
Students were also asked if they
felt an extension to the term by
one week would affect their
chance to gain summer employ-
ment. A majority felt that it would
not.

Swaggart criticized himself
on TV before scandal broke

By George W. Cornell

AP Religion Writer

NEW YORK — In the month
before TV evangelist Jimmy
Swaggart was silenced by scan-
dal, his preaching turned from
outward attacks to self-criticism
in what ”may have been the out-
growth of his own sin," a
researcher said. -

”He lately started putting him-
self down,” said Stephen M.
Winzenburg, a communications
professor at Florida Southern Col-
lege. ’’It makes you wonder how
much of it was guilt seeping
through.

”He usually had put others
down and pumped himself up as
being greater than anyone else,
with an inside, direct line to God.

But then all of a sudden, he start-

ed saying these negative,
deprecating things about himself.
He seemed to be pointing a
finger at himself, and preaching
it to others.”

Leaders of the Assemblies of
God in Swaggart’s Louisiana dis-
trict initially recommended that
he be suspended from preaching
for at least three months because
of his reported involvement with
a prostitute. National leaders of
the church have asked the district
to review that recommendation
and perhaps make the penalty
more severe.

Winzenburg, a Catholic whose
monitoring project mainly aimed
at timing and ‘comparing fund-
raising pitches of TV evangelists,
said he was puzzled when Swag-
gart began switching his preach-
ing targets.

’’It was something that hadn't
been there before, but now it
makes more sense,” he said in a
telephone interview. ’’It may
have been the outgrowth of his
own sin.

”He also started picking on fel-
low Pentecostals. Before, he had
focused more on attacking
Catholics and mainline Protes-
tants. But now he was denounc-
ing his own kind."

Swaggart lodged complaints of
sexual misconduct that led to the
ouster of former TV evangelist Jim
Bakker and. that also bumped a
New Orleans evangelist, Marvin
Gorman. Both were ministers of
the Assemblies of God. Gorman
reportedly provided evidence
that unseated Swaggart — pic-
tures of him at a motel with a
prostitute.

Board
reduces  
golf club’s
request

By Teresa Candori
Staff Writer

Student Government Board last
night approved $1,368.56 for the
Panther Golf Culb, whose origi-
nal request totaled over $12,000.

The club requested the money
to fund a trip to Seabrook Island,
S.C. The original request of
$12,383.56 was to provide trans-
portation, lodging, board and in-
structional workshops for 30 club
members, according to the allo-
cations form presented to the Stu-
dent Government.

According to Allocations Chair-
person Karen Bohichik, Student
Government's policy is to pro-
vide only the funds to cover half
the cost of transportation for club
trips of this nature.

No members of the Panther
Golf Club were present at the
meeting to defend the request.
Sang Hong, president of the Pan-
ther Golf Club, could not be
reached for comment at press-
time.

The SGB also denied requests
for funds from the Pitt Waterski
Club and Omicron Delta Kappa,
the upperclass honor society.

Omicron Delta Kappa has re-
quested money to fund a student-
faculty luncheon. The Allocations
Committee recommended the re-
quest be denied on the basis that
Student Activities monies can
only be used for students who
would be attending the lunch-
eon, not for faculty members or
students’ parents.

Melanie Naro, spokesperson
for Omicron Delta Kappa,
responded to the recommenda-
tion by pointing out that faculty
and non—students would be pay-
ing for their lunches, while the
money requested would be used
to fund only the students’
lunches.

The Board voted down the Al-
locations Committee's recom-
mendation, and agreed to review
the request again after spring
break.

The Board also voted down the
Committee's recommendation to
approve $7,569.90 for the Pitt
Waterski Club.

The Waterski Club requested
the money to lease a boat for use
in training and practicing.

The Board will review the
Waterski Club's request after
spring break as well.

Study

BOSTON —- A study of Mas-
sachusetts women who gave
birth found that one in 500 was
infected with the AIDS virus, and
researchers projecting their find-
ings nationwide said several
thousand AIDS-infected babies
could be born in the United
States each year.

Most surveys of AIDS infection
have concentrated on male
homosexuals, drug addicts and
others at high risk of catching the
disease. Estimating the preva-
lence of the virus in the general
population has been difficult.

”This paper gives a more ac-
curate way to judge the scope of
the epidemic in women,” said
Dr. Rodney Hoff. ”Nothing else
comes close to this in being able
to measure the prevalence in the
United States.”

Hoff directed the study at the
Massachusetts Department of
Public Health using tiny samples
of blood routinely drawn from
babies to check for phenyl-
ketonuria, or PKU, and other
diseases.

The study found that one of ev-
ery 476 women giving birth, or
2.1 for each 1,000, were infect-
ed with the AIDS virus. However,
this varied greatly, depending on
where they lived.

FDA chief: aspirin
may not help heart

ROCKVILLE, Md. — The Food
and Drug Administration chief on
Wednesday warned aspirin
manufacturers against making ad-
vertising claims that their product
is beneficial in the prevention of
a first heart attack.

FDA Commissioner Frank E.
Young met for over an hour with
the nation's leading aspirin
manufacturers and told them that
ads making such claims would
constitute ”mislabeling.”

Young cited no specific adver-
tising, and said his action was
prompted by a study published in
the Jan. 28 issue of the New En-
gland journal of Medicine, in
which an experiment using aspi-
rin indicated it was beneficial
among a large group of physi-
cians used as test subjects.

”The manufacturers agreed to
exercise voluntary restraint and
refrain from further promotion of
the study results until the facts of
the study are known, and the
necessary analyses were complet-
ed and appropriate physician
labeling made available,” Young
said at a news conference.

Aspirin manufactuers attending
the meeting at FDA headquarters
refused comment afterwards, ex-

judge rules Graham
murder confession ok

PHILADELPHIA -— A judge
Wednesday ruled the confession
by Harrison Graham to the slay-
ings of seven women in his north
Philadelphia apartment could be
admitted at trial and also reject-
ed a claim of illegal arrest.

Common Pleas Judge Robert
Latrone denied a defense motion
to suppress the confession and all
physical evidence seized by
police in Graham's home last Au-
gust. Defense attorney Joel Mol-
dovsky also had sought to have
the arrest of Graham declared
illegal.

Latrone said the validity of the
statement will be up to the jury.
He characterized Moldovsky’s
position as ”irrational and
absurd."

Moldovsky and Assistant Dis-
trict Attorney Roger King then

met with Latrone in his chambers
to discuss the start of jury selec-
tion, for which no date was im-
mediately set.

Little Tabatha doing
‘fine’ 4 months later

PITTSBURGH — Tabatha
Foster, the 3-year-old Kentucky
girl who received five organs in
a landmark transplant operation,
is ”progressing fine” more than
four months after surgery, hospi-
tal officials said Wednesday.

The girl, from Madisonville,
Ky., was reported still in serious
condition in a private room of
Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh.

”Her recovery has really been

somewhat uneventful,” said
hospital spokeswoman Lynn
McMahon. "She is really

progressing fine. There have been
no major bumps along the way.”

Tabatha underwent surgery
ending Nov. 1 to replace her
liver, pancreas, small intestine
and parts of her stomach and
colon.

Breaking the rules
in Daytona Beach

One more day.

After Friday, the first Pitt spring break in years will commence,
and the revelry should be reminiscent of scenes from Gore Vi-

da|’s Caligula.

College students will be streaming in huge numbers to Ver-
mont, Florida and various points between. Beer sales will reach
highs of epidemic proportions. The beaches and ski slopes of
the country will be overrun with young adults in search, if the
expression can be pardoned, of a "sure thing.”

It might do us all some good, though, to remember that ar-
rests for drunkenness, drug use, vandalism and general disord-
erly conduct increase dramatically during spring break. While
it might sound like a good idea to spend a week in a stupor,
the potential fallout could have effects lasting long after the han-

gover has faded.

We understand that to ask college students to adopt puritan-
ical behavior is going a little too far, but a word of caution is
in order. Michael Conrad's warning is particularly appropriate:
”Hey, let's be careful out there.”

In a nutshell 

The white man goes to his church and talks about Je-
sus. The Indian goes to his tipi and talks to Jesus.

— Quanah Parker, from The Anarchist’s Cookbook

Clarification of the issues

Having been quoted in an am-
biguous context in the Monday,
Feb. 29 issue of The Pitt News
(”Palestinian groups march in
protest of Israeli occupation”), I
wish to clarify my point of view
regarding this matter. When I said
 I think a lot of this is very un-
fair,” I was speaking out against
certain messages and images be-
ing disseminated by the Palestin-
ian groups. Such absurd state-
ments made were those which
equate Zionism with racism,
those which draw an analogy be-
tween Israel and South Africa and
those which compare the Holo-
caust with some unfortunate and
inexcusable breaches of Israeli
military law.

I can sympathize with the
legitimate right of the Palestinian
people to self—determination, but
the only voices of Palestinian
leaders heard are those which are
committed to an "indivisible
Palestine” (i.e. a Palestine which

LETTERS

encompasses the present-day Is-

rael) and those which deny Jews
their legitimate right to self-
determination. .

Where is a single responsible
voice in the Palestinian commun-
ity seriously interested in talking
about peace? There are a number
of Jewish Israelis, members of
Knesset, who are ready to negoti-
ate as soon as a moderate Pales-
tinian voice resonates above the
sounds of hatred, anger and
fanaticism.

It should be noted that [B’nai
B'rith] Hillel's reason for not is-
suing an official statement was
because Hillel is an umbrella
Jewish organization on campus
representing numerous Jewish
movements and perspectives.
Hillel is planning a response in
the form of educational program-

ming to take place sometime in
March.

Mellot a liability

Kevin Mellot has become a big-
ger problem than his so-called
”problem bars.” He has taken
such license with his position as
Asst. Fire Chief, and acted in so
many ways never intended for
that position, that he should be
dismissed now before something
really dangerous happens. [...]

Thank God we finally have a
zealot crusader to harass small
clubs and gay people and college
kids who have the audacity to
stay up and have drinks. This
man is sick. [...] Mellot is a sore
on this city's face. Get rid of him,
now.

John C. Picone

Doomsday winds are blowing through the city

Two weeks ago, I mentioned
that I felt that I had to change the
name of this column. At the time,
I was desperate. I needed help.
So I did what any normal person
would do. I wrote a letter to Pat
Robertson, and I asked him to ask
God to help me.

Dear Mister Reverend Pat
Robertson,

I need your help, sir.

I write a weekly column for
The Pitt News, the student
newspaper of the University of
Pittsburgh. My column is called
The Naked City, and since a na-
tional magazine also runs a
column by the same name, I feel

that I must change the name of

mine.

But Pat, I don't want to. I like
the name I have for it now.

Now, I understand that you are
in regular contact with the
Almighty, and I've also heard that
you once changed the direction
of a hurricane with his help.

Well, sir, the winds of

PAIII. ANATER

THE NAKED CITY

copyright infringement are stir-
ring, and I'm wondering if you
could possibly get them to
change direction and save my
column.

With all respect, Reverend, can
you help me?

Dear Paul,

When the Lord and I met for
our weekly tea last week, I asked
him about your situation.

”Absolutely not” was his thun-
dering response. Your column
has made him maddern’ a hornet
in a henhouse. Since your
column has upset upstanding
people like me, God doesn't like
you, Paul.

I will now interpret his
response of ’’absolutely not."

First of all, the name itself
angers our Lord. You see, Paul,

nudity is a grave sin, and advocat-
ing an entire city of naked peo-
ple is a moral outrage. Keep in
mind what happened to Sodom
and Gomorrah.

Your choice of topics is hardly
Christian. In one of your early
columns, you interviewed two
people who helped organize a
demonstration for gay pride.

God doesn't like gays, Paul.
They use words like ”madcap"
and “festive”; they wear special
boots, and they swing their hips
when they walk.

You also support their attempts
to gain recognition as a viable
minority group. Sodomy is an
aberration; the fact that you sup-
port them will land youin hell as
fast as those who participate in it.

In a later column, you stood up
for a man who's had mental
problems.

Mental problems are signs of
demonic possession. The mental-
ly ill need an exorcism, not sup-
port and understanding. They
should be ignored and allowed to
run willy-nilly until they realize
that they need people like me to
chase those pesky demons away.

Then you wrote about two
teenage prostitutes whose con-
versation you overheard.

Eavesdropping is a moral
boobytrap, and in writing about
them, you were condoning their
lust.

Lust is a problem in our socie-
ty, and even though you may
have changed their names, I'm
sure that they were simply en-
couraged to continue in their lust.

Perhaps some of your readers
may have chosen to enter the life
of a prostitute when they read
your article, which glorified it.

You also run letters and poems
that people send to you.

This is bad.

Young people have too much
time on their hands today. The
poems and letters you've run are

obviously the result of drug in-
duced euphoria.

Drugs are bad. Satan speaks to
people who are under the in-
fluence of drugs. He creates their
hallucinations, and he traps peo-
ple into addiction, which is actu-
ally a different form of
possession. You are encouraging
Satanic possession by condoning
our young people's poetry and,
indirectly, their drug use.

By the way, being charismatic
is a better trip anyway.

Paul, there is nothing I can do
for you, other than pray that you
will mend your ways and find a
more appropriate name.

The First Amendment was not
intended to allow people like you
to advocate moral turpitude and
understanding between people
like me and the amoral hordes.

You're welcome.

So that letter settles it. The
Naked City is no longer. It was
fun while it lasted. Ciood-bye and
thank you.

Moliere trips to the sixties

By Susan Washburn

Showcase Editor

Moliere’s classic, The Misan-
thrope, travels through time, stop-
ping briefly in 1966 and con-
tinuing onto 1988. The produc-
tion of The Misanthrope at the
University of Pittsburgh brings
Moliere’s timeless message to a
modern audience via a 1966
setting.

In a luxurious French sitting
room, Alceste (Harry Bouvy) and
Philinte (Kenneth J. Roberts) ar-
gue over whether possessing po-
liteness and social grace is a
virtue or a vice. Alceste vehe-
mently opposes the image-
conscious artificiality of his social
class while Philinte contends that
social grace and tact are neces-
sary for survival.

Overall, the energy level of the
production was uneven. Despite

continuous movement, the
scenes with only Alceste and
Philinte were often slow. Neither
Bouvy nor Roberts conveyed the
sense of conviction in their view-
points that would spark interest in
this debate. Bouvy’s tendency to
get caught in the rhyme coupled
with his talking upstage made un-
derstanding difficult at times.

Bringing life to the production
are Anne Louise Bannon as
Cellmene and the entourage of
one-dimensional supporting
characters. Bannon as the pouty
and manipulating love interest
adds a vivacious sexual energy to
the production. She is the epito-
my of the self-obsession that
Moliere accuses society of being
absorbed in.

The funniest scenes in this
comedy are the encounters that
Alceste has with those of high so-
ciety. First comes Oronte (Dereck

R. Walton) a la Sgt. Pepper attire.
In his bright orange band uni-
form, his presence is as obnox-
ious as his attire. Walton's
confidence and timing make
Oronte enjoyably irritating.

Squealing onto the stage in
their furs and groovy suits are
Clitandre (Steve Sirulnik) and
Acaste (Jerry Scott). This catty pair
gossips and giggles even more
than Lucy and Ethel from I Love
Lucy.

Also known for her gossip is
the spinster Arsinoe (Nona Cer-
ard). Gerard gasps and gulps her
drink, conveying Arsinoe’s prud-
ish incredulity at Cellmene’s
overtly insulting behavior.

Rounding out the cast is Kellee
Van Aken as Eliante. Although
understanding her was difficult at
times, Van Aken’s quiet confi-
dence provided a secure and

If it is dyed it's not buried at the Baba Klub

By Joel Timulak

Assistant Showcase Editor

Alex Hutnik wonders aloud:
”What’s the idea of a priest mak-
ing a blessing?” Hutnik is the
owner and creative founder of
Baba «Klub, a South Side
storefront and tie-dye factory.
”And have you ever heard of sec-
ond-degree relics in the church?
They’re like a piece of cloth that
touched a saint’s bone. Our
clothes are imbued with spirit,
haunted.”

The Baba Klub has been open
on the South Side since August of
1987. They specialize in tie—dyed
and silkscreened T-shirts and den-
ims. Currently, while filling ord-
ers, Hutnik is finding models for
a fashion show/party at the Up—
stage which will feature a reggae
band and is tentatively scheduled
for March 25.

The show is going to be held
to show the new silkscreens and
Baba Klub cata|og’s newest item:
shorts. The shorts were made by
a local seamstress and are the first
departure from treating shins and
denims made by other manufac-
turers. Hutnik plans on emerging
with his own line of clothing and
is moving toward constructing
custom-screened fabrics.

An idea he is working on is us-
ing Klub’s traveling business ”ad-
ventures” as silkscreens for future
designs of old-time baseball uni-
forms and bowling shirts. He's

. also negotiating with a denim

manufacturer in Yugoslavia.

”The clothes would be blessed,
touched. They'd be haunted,” he
said. A forerunner to his ex-
periential clothing idea is one of
the Andy Warhol silkscreens he
markets: a photo of the Warhola
gravestone. ”l'd like to do a
whole series of pop heroes’
gravestones. I'm also getting in-
terested in Evil Kenevil," said
Hutnik.

Moliere-—

Continued from page 7
touching performance.

For the ending scene of the
production, director Cordon
McDougall leaves Cellmene
alone in the sitting room appar-
ently wrought with anguish over
her misdeeds as a mirrored ball
spins reflections around her. The
ending was too melodramatic for
the tone set throughout the entire
play. McDougall should have
quit while he was ahead and end-
ed the play before this fiasco.

Hutnik discovered Andy War-
hol in high school. He liked the
fact that Warhol seemed to pro-
duce brilliant work effortlessly
and didn't try to hide his mis-
takes. Furthermore, Warhol was
from Pittsburgh, of Eastern Euro-
pean descent and born under the
sign of leo, just as was Hutnik.

Warhol made it big in New
York City by carrying his work to
shows in grocery bags, but Hut-
nik, while inspired by the late
pop genius’s attitude, would like
to be successful enough to stay in
Pittsburgh.

"I think America is entering an
era of smaller cities, and I'm pret-
ty enthusiastic about Pittsburgh
and the South Side,” said Hutnik.
Some of Hutnik’s silkscreens
were designed by local artists,
and so were some airbrushed
shirts he markets.

”l’ve traveled quite a bit, here
and abroad, and I'm plenty com-
fortable in Pittsburgh. It's sort of
the John Cougar Mellencamp at-
titude.” He's commissioning a lo-
cal cartoonist to create a series of
strips of the Baba Klub employees
at work and on their business
road-trips. The Baba Klub’s bou-
tique is decorated by three large

oil canvasses also by local artists,
including Hutnik’s old partner
Dan Coe.

Alex and Dan were recent
Grove City College graduates
when they were commisioned by
Alex's ailing baba (an affection-
ate name used by Eastern Euro-
peans for their grandmothers) to
clean her basement. They found
five bottles of Clorox and began
experimenting with their jeans.

After a long period of trial and
error, they developed a batik
look. It had the opposite effect of
camouflage, so they named it
Kolorflage, and it became their
trademark and launching pad
into a national marketplace.

That exposure began essential-
ly by accident. Dan Coe was ex-
hibiting his paintings at the
Shadyside Arts Festival in August
of 1987. His paintings weren't
selling and so, on the last day, he
and Alex hung up some of their
tie-dyed shirts and ”Kolorflage”
jackets and jeans on parking
meters and tables. They all sold.
They began production on a
small scale to sell to friends and
inquirers.

et that had no assemb|y—line twin,
encouraged Alex and Dan to
show at fashion shows in Pitts-
burgh. These shows led to a year
of trips to fashion shows in Atlan-
ta, New York City, Georgetown
and Boston, where Baba Klub
clothes were marketed in T-shirt
and record stores.

Their jeans were exhibited as
art at the Fashion Institute of
Technology in New York City in
an exhibit called ”Denim Fast
Forward.” Levi Strauss filmed
models in Baba Klub Kolorflage
jackets for their promotional
video.

The Baba Klub also appeared
on KDKA-TV’s Evening Maga-
zine, and that segment was sent
to evening magazine shows in 30
other cities. When NBC’s Today
Show aired in Pittsburgh, they
gave weatherman Willard Scott a
Kolorflage necktie which he wore
on national television.

Since the opening of the South
Side showroom, Dan Coe has left
for a career in sales, and Alex has
been paying several employees
to keep up with large orders from
clubs, school and stores. Recent-

ly, Alex hired Charles Pavlick full-
time to help manage the the long
hands-on process required to
produce mass orders.

Ultimately, Alex would like to
import and export clothing to the
Soviet Union as cultural ex-
change. He's sold several shirts
silkscreened with Soviet appeal,
including one with ”Baba K|ub"
in Cyrillic lettering.

Wherever he travels, Alex
maintains that his clothes are
recognized as more than tie—dye,
especially with British mod
themes and Warhol designs. He
has, however, recently designed
a Grateful Dead silkscreen be-
cause of constant request.

He realizes that tie-dye is a sort
of fad, but maintains the attitude
represented by the bright colors
and spontaneous design is impor-
tant to the Baba Klub credo. ’’I
like playing with color and de-
sign. instead of buying orange
fabric, I can make it.

”We give our fabric an aura;
we create sacred fabrics. It's like
we're a real club; as if people can
share a common experience by
owning a piece of [our] clothing."

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, March 3, 1988

 
 

By Maureen Fayle

For The Pit! News

The Carnegie Mellon Universi-
ty /\rt (lallery is now featuring a
(Jordon Matta-(‘lark exhibit enti-
tled ’’A Retrospective." The ex-
hibit opened Feb. 14 and will
continue through April 1(). Cities
such as New York, Chicago, Paris
and Milan have previously ex-
hibited the innovative work of
Matta—Clark. An exhibition in the
Brooklyn Museum will follow his
Pittsburgh show.

Matta-Clark was born in 1943
antl dietl at the age of 35. He was
the son oi‘ the surrealist painter
Roberto Matta and was exposed
to establishetl artistic circles at an
early age. In 1968, he graduated
tiom (‘ornell University’s School
ot /\rt hitecture. He then bet ame
involved in a creative group, in-
tent on (list overing radical solu-
tions tor sot ietal problems
through an anart histit torni oi ar-
thitet ture. Appropriately, the
group was talled "Anar-
thitei ture."

\'tatta-(‘lark maintaiiietl this
ratlit al bent throughout his
t aieei. l lis ait t learlx ( aptures his
liberal anti-establisliment in-
tentiiins.

The exhibit consists laigelx ot

exhibit, sut h as iet ieations oi the
rat atle oi one building and a
small set tion or a house. The
materials that make up these
strut tures are pieces or debris t)r
reiuse ioiiiitl among building
sites. The artist makes no attempt
to retine these materials, ( reating
an interesting sense oi reality tor
the viewer‘. The artist primarily
tenters on art hitet ture in tlilapi-
dated urban enxironments. \\"ith-
in this traineworls, he
e\perinients with both lines and
spatial relationships through ai-
thitet ture and makes artistit
statements with the intention oi"

((‘[)ll()11S.

For example, ”Splitting," com-
pleted in 197-1, exemplifies how
the artist tiuestionetl stable.
»\merit an middle-t lass existence.
In this work, he tlrilled two
parallel holes in a typit al Ameri-
can home. The light treated be-
tween the trat ks represents a
liberation irom the stagnant, un-
thanging surroundings of the
house’s interior.

The photographs of "Bingo,'
also completed in 1974, rep-
resent similar anti-establishment
ideas. The artist dividetl one side
or a tondemned house into set-
iions antl removetl the pieces one
by one.

An architectural endeavor with
a different motive is "lacob'_s Lad-
der,” (()ti1[)l(‘l(‘(’l in 1977. The ar-
tist iocuserl on the use of
industrial ( himneys to suggest al-
ternative forms of housing. Nets
were placed between three or
tour chimneys, and house-like
structures were created where the
netting crossed. An additional
work that eniphasizes the artist's
interest in experimenting with cir-
cular forms in space is the ”Con-
ical Intersect,” finished in 1975.
Matta-Clark utilized two 17th-
century Paris‘ townhouses; the

binetl with his motives, makes his
art (]ttll(‘ eltettive. The work ot
this artist was not intended to be

aspects into his designs hente,

the American lifestyle, whit h was
the basis of "Splitting/’ His con-
cern for alternative housing as
rellettetl in ”latob's Ladder" also
tonveys the behavioral aspects of
his art. Therefore, considering
that Matta-(Tlark’s designs were
intentletl to stimulate thought and
make sot ial statements, he was
siit‘tesst'u|. In addition, Matia-
(‘lark’s desire to break away from
the tontept oi" tunttional ar-

chitecture, also makes his art et-
tective.

It is clear that his architecture
was not designed solely for prac-
tital purposes or to accommo-
date the painter.

A tinal element adding to the
impatt of Matta—(7lark’s art was
his objective to treate ratlital,
liberal designs. His unique ar-
(l1ll(’(lUt‘t1l plans antl his mixture
oi’ metlia are examples of his in-
novative technique. He sought a
more open-minded, unrestricted
sot iety, and his work fostered
such thinking. Regardless of
whether or not the viewer enjoys
Matta-Clark's work, or agrees
with his artistic statenients, one
mi.ist admit that he was success-
ml in suggesting new architet tur-
al alternatives and evoking
thought on the part of the viewer.

Frantic is tamely commercial

By Gina Landi

Staff Writer

Roman Po|anski’s first major
Ho|lywood—backed film in a de-
cade belies its title. Frantic is
rather calm. Hoping that this film
would be as stylish as his old
work, I rushed out to see it.

I should have known better af-
ter reading that the new Polanski
likes to direct films that ”entertain
and portray profound human
emotions.” I should have known
in advance to expect something
tamely commercial and not very
”profound” at all.

The film, set in Paris, focuses
on an American surgeon, Richard
Walker (Harrison Ford), and his
attempts to locate his kidnapped
wife, Sondra (Betty Buckley).

Everyone he turns to —— the

French police, the U.S. embassy
»— is helpful enough, albeit in a
stony kind of way that illustrates
their insensitivity to what Walk-
er is going through. Walker’s an-
guish over possibly losing the
woman he loves is what Frantic
is about.

This is a very personal film for
Polanski (considering what hap-
pened to Sharon Tate), but in the
attempt to blend a heavy emo-
tional (unfortunately, too domes-
tic) theme with a thriller plot, he
has made a curiously dull film.

What makes Frantic so tame?
The lack of well-drawn, interest-
ing supporting characters certain-
ly detracts from it. For the first
hour, all we see is Harrison Ford
running around asking authorities
to help him. None of them pro-
vide any conflict other than in-

sinuating that his wife may be
cheating on him.

The most intriguing event in
the film occurs right before Son-
dra disappears. She tries, unsuc-
cessfully, to tell Richard where
she is going to go in a Hitchcock-
ian shower sequence — as the
steamy glass door slides shut, it
plays on the other great shower-
fear (mine at least) — isolation
and the inability to communicate.
After this, though, Harrison Ford
is forced to carry a|most_every
scene in the film.

I kept asking myself if Polanski
expected the audience to find

one character fascinating enough ‘

to warrant the amount of screen
time he gives him. In terms of
script and plot, there is frighten-
ingly little done to make anything
in this film fascinating.

Television man longs to get out of his chair

By David Ballarotto

Staff Writer

As we get ready to celebrate
the joyous season of spring, we
begin the great American custom
known as reruns. This is the time
of the year when you get to catch
everything you've missed during
the regular season.

Therefore, we all must be pre-

pared to be well-rounded TV-

watchers. I’m offering the ideal
TV—addict schedule for the com-
ing weeks. It has enough news,
fun, competition and romance to
give spice to even the most bor-
ing of lives.

The first category is news and
information. Although it is ex-
tremely important to be well-
informed, some news programs
are incredibly boring. With the
following schedule, you'll be
able to hold an intelligent conver-

sation —— maybe.

CBS This Morning —- Kathleen
Sullivan and Harry Smith are an
adept pair of hosts. They are
skilled interviewers and are at just
that right level of happiness you
want when you wake up in the
morning. Mark McEwen, the pro-
gram's weatherman, used to be a
stand-up comedian — it shows;
he is an entertaining guy. Watch
this program five times a week.

CBS Evening News with Dan
Rather —- For real viewing pleas-
ure, see if George Bush is going
to be interviewed. If not, just re-
lax and watch the superb cover-
age Rather, along with Bill Plante,
Bob Schieffer and Rita Braver
give the day's events. Again, a
sure thing five days a week.

This Week with David Brink-
ley — if you're up Sunday morn-
ing, this program privides a full
hour of commentary, analysis

and news. The show is informa-
tive and not at all boring. Once
a week will make your week.

IDIl:lI

For a while, there weren't any
sitcoms worth watching on the
tube. But times changed with the
advent of Bill Cosby. The follow-
ing represent fine entertainment
and may even prompt interesting
or amusing conversation.

The Cosby Show — There's a
guy who's a doctor. He has a wife
who's a lawyer. They have five
kids. Sounds trite, but it is an ex-
cellent half—hour show. You've
seen this one by now, right?

Newhart — Another deceptive-
ly simple setup. An innkeeper
and his goofy workers. Newhart
is very vogue. lt’s a madcap
comedy and is a must if you want

Night Court —— This show and
all of its actors provide for a half-
hour of entertaining and absurd
humor. This is perhaps the best
writing on television. Hint: If you

Game shows and soap operas
are the shows that everyone likes
and won't admit to watching. is
there anything more entertaining
than watching Bob Barker or
more intriguing than Mason and
Julia on Santa Barbara. Admit it;
you know there isn't.

The Price is Right — When this
program came on in 1972, it set
the tone for almost all successful
game shows. In fact, the 1950's

version was the first truly success-
ful prize-oriented game show.
Watch it, and see if you can imi-
tate the big wheel.

. Santa Barbara — This is an un-
usual soap opera. It's a direct
descendent from radio's Perry
Mason. It has a mystery-oriented
slant, yet it has a tongue—in-cheek
style that sets it apart from all of
the rest. If you haven't yet, give
up General Hospital and Guiding
Light.

Wheel of Fortune — it changed
its format in October, and now
contestants play for cash.
Bummer.

As you can tell, many shows
have been left out. If you still
watch Late Night with David Let-
terman, then by all means do it.
Just make sure you're up in time
tomorrow to watch Harry Smith
and Kathleen Sullivan.

Wrestlers prepare for EWL championship

By Vince Carey
Assistant Sports Editor

All season, Pitt wrestling coach

‘Rande Stottlemyer has been look-

ing toward one thing: the Eastern
Wrestling League's champion-
ship tournament.

”This year's tournament should
be outstanding,” Stottlemyer
said. ”The competition in the
EWL this season has been very
strong. Everybody should be

ready.”

This year, the tourney takes
place at Lock Haven University,
March 4 and 5. The top three
places in each weight class ad-

. vance to the NCAA’s at Ames,

Iowa, March 19 to 21.

”The only thing that 1 don't like
is that our whole lineup isn't
here,” Stottlemyer said. ”Mike
Tongel [ankle injury] and Dave
Ciafre [knee] won’t be able to
compete. I feel bad for them, but

Pirates steal the show,
upset Panthers, 83-7 9

By Vince Carey

Assistant Sports Editor

It was supposed to be Pitt's
night.

It was the night that the Pan-
thers honored Demetreus Gore
and Charles Smith for their ac-
complishments.

Pitt even went so far as to re-
tire Smith's now-famous No.32.

”That is a great honor,” said
Smith, who led all scorers with
25 points. ’’It really surprised me.
1 had heard rumors that they
might do such a thing, but l never
really thought that it would
happen/’

It was supposed to be Pitt's
night.

Everything was going accord-
ing to plan. Then the game
started.

The Seton Hall Pirates stole the
night right away from the Pan-
thers. For the second time in less
than two weeks, the Panthers fell
to Seton Hall, this time, 83-79.

There was a sense of imminent
doom on the very first play. Smith
tipped the jumpball to Sean
Miller, but Pirate guard John Mor-
ton stole the ball and put in an
easy layup.

”Last week's win was enor-
mous at the time [an 89-72 Seton
Hall win against Pitt], but this one
is even bigger,” Seton Hall coach
P.J. Carlesimo said. ”To beat a
team like Pitt twice in one season
is great, and to beat them in their
own building is phenomenal.”

The loss dropped Pitt, ranked
seventh by the Associated Press,
into a first-place Big East tie with
Syracuse at 11-4. The Panthers
are 21-5 overall. Seton Hall is
20-10 overall. The Pirates are in

a fourth-place tie with Geor-
getown and St. John's with an 8-7
record.

The first half was slow-paced.
Seton Hall moved out to an ear-
ly 7-2 lead, but Pitt was able to
come back. Smith scored on a
turnaround jumper, Miller put in
a three-pointer and Smith fol-
lowed with the second three of
his career.

The lead went back and forth
from that point on, but Seton Hall
was able to lead by four at hal-
ftime, 41-37.

"I'm very proud of our guys,”
Carlesimo said. ”They got the
ball inside when we needed it
and hit the free throws when it
counted.”

The Panthers shot 38 percent
from the field and were outre-
bounded 25-15 in the first half. lt
was turning into a tough night for
the Panthers.

”We were outhustled, outre-
bounded and not coming up with
the basketball when we needed
it,” Pitt coach Paul Evans said.

The second half was a different
story. After a few minutes of run-
ning back and forth, the teams
slowed down and the Pirates took
control of the game.

With 13 minutes left, the Hall
held a commanding 15-point
lead, 60-45.

All seemed lost, but somebody
forgot to tell No.33 that the game
was over.

Gore took over in a single-
handed effort to pull the Panthers
back into the game. Gore drove
down the middle for two, a
dished-off to Bobby Martin for
two more and Pitt had the
momentum going their way.

Jerome Lane jumped into the

I think the team that we have in
there will be very competitive.”
Pitt's lineup will look the same
as it has for the last month of the
season.
At 118 pounds will be Brian
O’Korn, followed by Matt

Gerhard at 126.

Alan Utter will replace Ciafre
at 134. ’’I think that Alan is go-
ing to win,” Stottlemyer said.
”He is going to surprise some
people. 1 really believe that he is

going to be the first unseeded
wrestler ever to win the tour-
nament.”

All-America Pat Santoro is the
odds—on favorite to win the 142
division and comes in as the No.
1 seed. Freshman Scott Hovan

will either be the second or third ‘

seed at 150. Jeff Turner is pen-
ciled in at 158, and Mike Rossi
is at 167.

"1 67 is pretty well set as far as
the first two are concerned,”

Stottlemyer said. ’’It all depends
on Cleveland State; if they drop
one wrestler down a weight, the
first three will be set.”

Bill Lewis, Perry Miller and
John Owens round out the Pan-
thers lineup.

”This is a stepping stone to the
nationals," said Stottlemyer. ”For
those who don't make it to Iowa,

it is the most important tourney ‘

of the year.”

Senior Mark Bryant scored 23 points and pulled down 13 rebounds to lead Seton Hall.

show with three of his ten points.
But here came Gore again. A bril-
liant pass from Miller, and Gore
sent up a rainbow-like three-
pointer that lit up the crowd. Se-
ton Hall had no choice but to call
a timeout. Pitt trailed by only
62-55.

’’I tried to get the team fired

up,” Gore said. ’’It worked a lit-
tle bit and we got rolling, but I
don't want to take the credit. The
whole team played well during
the run. 1 might have scored the
points, but the rest of the team
should get credit.”

Pitt was in the midst of a 23-5
run that resulted in a 66-65 lead

with just over seven minutes re-
maining.

The Panthers eventually were
able to stretch the lead to 75-67

Bryant reaching new heights for Seton Hall

By Thomas Danyluk
Staff Writer

It's probably no mere coinci-
dence that the Seton Hall Pirate
who wears a double-zero on his
uniform has a last name that
rhymes with the word ”giant.”

Bryant. As in Mark Bryant.

And after Seton Hall's stunning
83-79 upset win over the Pitt Pan-
thers last evening, it may as well
be ”Giant.”

Bryant, the Pirates’ 6-foot-9
senior power-fon/vard, fired in 23
points and yanked down 13 re-
bounds in Seton Hall's second
win over Pitt this season. The vic-
tory gives Seton Hall (20-10, 8-7

in the Big East) its first 20-win sea-
son since its 1955-56 campaign.
‘'1 think we match up well with
Pitt,” said Bryant, moments after
he finished his war-hooping vic-
tory celebration in the Pirates’
lockerroom. ”We’re just playing
great ball now. We've been
working real hard and a lot of
desire has got us where we are.”
And where the Pirates most
likely are now is among the elite
field chosen to participate in the
NCAA Tournament, especially af-
ter last night's nationally-televised
win. Aside from last year's ap-
pearance in the NIT, Seton Hall
hasn't qualified for post-season
competition in 10 years.

”We’re really playing well right
now. I definitely think we’re a
lock for a tournament bid.
Definitely.

”We’ve been losing games by
two points. Now things are start-
ing to turn around for us."

Scoring and rebounding aren't
the only strengths of Bryant's
game. He hustles well for a play-
er with his husky physical build.
One example: midway through
the second half, Pitt's Jerome
Lane bulled his way to the basket
on Bryant. The shot went up,
then so did Bryant, ferociously
swatting the shot out of bounds.
He then proceded to bat away
the Panthers’ ensuing inbounds

pass, which eventually wound up
in the hands of one of his Pirate
teammates.

Bryant was named Player of the
Week by Sports Illustrated after
his excellent performances last
week against Pitt and Villanova.

Through most of last night's
game, Bryant was immovable in
the paint. Much of Seton Hall's
offense was centered around
pounding the ball inside to the
bulky, physical forward -— the
tactic sent Bryant to the foul line
14 times. Under the basket,
Bryant was successful in the
pushing and shoving matches
with Pitt's Charles Smith and

Lane, and he appeared to out-
muscle Smith defensively inside.
But Bryant claims he didn't do ex-
actly what he wanted with Smith.

’’Charles is a great shooter.
That's his game. He gave me a
good game, but he likes to roam
more around the outside. My
game is closer to the basket. I like
to use my strength cause I know
I'm kinda strong.”

it seems that ‘Bryant knows ex-
actly how to keep that body
strong and fit, too. After the post-
game handshakes, he headed im-
mediately toward the concession
stand and bought himself a well-
deserved hot dog.

Walking into Fitzgerald Field
House on an evening of a Pitt
women's basketball game, it is
impossible not to notice Lorri
Johnson stretching and shooting
in warmups.

She is the talented one, swish-
ing shot after shot, smiling and
wearing two knee braces -
gaudy pieces of metal that look
more like miniature seat belts ——
constraining all movement.

Those braces tell the story of a
tedious and trying rehabilitation
period, before Johnson could
even think about running on the
court.

Johnson had surgery on both
knees after injuries suffered in her
sophomore and senior seasons in
high school. Despite missing nine
games, she went on to score
2,1 10 career points and become
Lawrence County's all-time lead-
ing scorer in women's basketball.

She was named the WPIAL

Johnson had no idea when
leaving New Castle High School
that it would be a year and a half
before she would play competi-

The times to follow tore at her
desire. It was difficult to sit there,
watch and not be able to do what
she does best.

Expected recovery time for the
average person is at least one full
year. However, Lorri Johnson
does not represent the norm. She
was jogging within nine months.
She credits Pitt women's basket-

teammates for inspiration.

”Every time I missed rehab,
Coach Bruce marked it down to
make me run —— when I was final-

Track teams ready for

By Don Boyd

Staff Writer

The Pitt women's track team
travels to Yale University for the
Eastern Championships this
weekend while the men's team is
at Princeton University for the
lC4A Championships.

Pitt coach Steve Lewis is ex-
pecting a strong performance
from his Lady Panthers. "Our
goal is to be very competitive.
We feel we could possibly finish
in the top 10 teams,” said Lewis.

Among the individual perform-
ers expected to excel for the Lady
Panthers are freshmen Keisha De-
mas and Clarissa Dudley.

Demas recently captured the
400-meter run in the Big East. The

joyable for Johnson. When
preseason conditioning began,
she found out that the view from
the bench can be depressing.

’’I hated preseason. I hated it,”
Johnson said. ”Coach Bruce
[knew] it was killing me.”

The frustration of ”just not be-
ing able” was a definite reality.

”She just wanted to do what
everybody else was doing and be
a part of the team,” Bruce said.

”On top of all that, Johnson
faced a weight problem, typical
of that type of injury since it limits
any type of exercise and move-
ment. Johnson rapidly gained 25
pounds after her operations and
needed to drop the weight just as
quickly before she could return.

”The extra weight would have
been too much pressure on her
knees, and the joint would have
suffered,” said Bruce.

The odds were stacking up
against the young athlete, and all
she wanted to do was play in her
first game. It was eight games
later, and she was 20 pounds
lighter, before she got her
chance.

possibility of running an NCAA
qualifying time will have her
primed for a top performance this
weekend. Demas will anchor the
mile relay team consisting of
Cynthia Randolph, Gloria Azeke
and Ardythe Hope.

Dudley will be entered in the
triple jump with fellow Lady Pan-
thers Dana Roberts and Alexis
Archer. With Dudley and Han-
nah Russell in the pentathalon,
Lewis is pleased. "We feel we
have two of the top five pentath-
letes in the meet," said Lewis.

Men's coach John Vasvary is
concerned about the possibility
of world-class sprinter Lee
McRae's missing the lC4A meet.
McRae cramped up at a meet last
weekend and is questionable.

However, Vasvary reflects a

Johnson rebounds to lead Panthers

The team traveled to the
Nevada-Las Vegas Tournament
whereshe played in the first
round against Missouri-Kansas
City. It was the second game,

however, before Johnson made a ,

contribution, scoring 10 points.

’’I felt like a freshman all over
again,” the 5-foot-1 1 sophomore
said. ’’I didn't want to do any-
thing wrong, and I didn't want to
get pulled out.”

Johnson, a power forward, has
since geared her energies toward
the court, to the benefit of the

, Lady Panthers. She is scoring a

team-high 13.9 points per game
-— 15.7 in the Big East — and is
averaging 5.8 rebounds. She also
has 36 assists, a compliment to
her deft passing.

The Big East could be ready to
recognize Johnson's talent by
naming her All-Conference. It
might happen in early March,
and ironically, that is almost one
year after her rehabilitation
began.

”The scary part is," Bruce
offered, ”no one has seen the true
Lorri Johnson.

weekend

cool air of confidence in his
team. ’’It is a wide-open meet.
Georgetown has a lot of depth,
while George Mason and Penn
State will send well-rounded
teams.

"If Lee can run, he can be
worth 10 points to us. But on our
team, when someone is down,
someone else picks up,” said
Vasvary.

Among the potential standouts
for the Panthers in the meet are
George lfill and Dave Moore. Ifill
finished second in the lC4A’s
55-meter hurdles last year while
Moore was runner-up in the
800-meter run.

Elbert Ellis, Pitt's freshman track
phenomenon, will be out to build
on his winning performance in
the Big East 400-meter run.
