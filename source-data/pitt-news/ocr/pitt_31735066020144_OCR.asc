Convocation

Pitt's bicentennial
celebration kicks off

By Matthew Thornton
Staff Writer

Marking the official opening of
Pitt's bicentennial, educators from
across the country and Pitt "officials
gathered at the Syria Mosque for the
opening Bicentennial Convocation.
The keynote speakers were Kingman
Brewster and David A. Hamburg.
The two were awarded honorary
degrees following a processional
from the Cathedral lawn.

0 AAU meet at Pitt, page 8

Led by a drum and flute group
dressed in Revolutionary War
costumes, the processional included
an ROTC Color Guard and various
student organizations. Represen-
tatives of many of Pitt's schools as
well as presidents of other univer-
sities followed.

Many of the delegates were present
for the Association of American
Universities meeting, held at Pitt for
the first time since it became a
member in 1974. The AAU, compris-
ed of '57 of the best research univer-
sities in the country,,met to discuss
the future of American college educa-
tion.

Brewster is currently master of the
University College at Oxford. He
formerly served as U.S. ambassador
to the United Kingdom and as presi-
dent of Yale University where he ad-

_ vocatecl social and academic reform.

”Brewster was chosen because he
is a symbol of the the ceremonial
academic group to be at the convoca-
tion," Harry Kunselman of the
bicentennial planning office said
earlier this fall.

SGB

approves
"90"
sculpture

By Teresa Candori

' Assistant News Editor

The Student Government Board
unanimously approved a $5,000
budget modification for a neon
sculpture to be presented to the
university in honor of the bicen-
tennial.

According to board member Dave
Konkolics, the $5,000 will enable
artist Jane Haskell to complete a life-
size drawing of the sculpture and to
begin work with the fabricators.

The 20-by-30-foot neon sculpture
will occupy the wall outside the
ballroom in the atrium of the William
Pitt Union.

Director of Student Activities Joyce
Giangarlo said she and the SGB re-
jected three abstract designs before
deciding on the Cathedral, the official-
symbol of the bicentennial, and the
panther mascot against a stylized
”tree,” the 14 different colored bran-
ches of which represent the separate
major fields of study.

’’I think it's pretty easily represen-

Our charge is the
custody of the pursuit
of truth.

—Kingman Brewster

Brewster’s speech focused on the
past "achievements ‘of American
higher education and. the respon-
sibilities colleges have ‘to the rest of
the community.

”Our charge [as university leaders]
is notthe custody of proof. Our

charge is the custody of the pursuit

of truth,” Brewster said.

Brewster advised the assembled
presidents of the need for increased
communication between the aca-
demic community and the rest of
society. ' '

Hamburg, the second speaker at
the ceremony, was awarded a Doc-
tor of Humane Letters by Dr. Thomas

. Detre, senior vice president for health

services at Pitt. Hamburg, the presi-
dent of the Carnegie Corp., has
served on numerous public policy
boards.

Pitt President Wesley Posvar
awarded Bicentennial Medallions of
Distinction to five Pitt alumni at the
ceremonies: Steven C. Beering, presi-
dent of Purdue University;
Genevieve Blatt, a judge in the Com-

monwealth court system of Penn--

sylvania; Bernard Fisher, a Pitt cancer
researcher; Frederick S. Humphries,
president of Tennessee State Univer-
sity; and Joseph Katz, senior chair-
man of Papercraft and a Pitt trustee.

tree of knowledge,” Giangarlo said.
”We didn't want people to look at it
and say, ’What is that?’ ”

SGB president Jim Mumma said
the design is appropriate for the
bicentennial. -

”The theme of the bicentennial is
primarily historic but mostly
futuristic,” Mumma said. ”We decid-
ed to do this because it would be a
lasting tribute, and it’s also something
that's never been done before.”

The idea for a neon sculpture was
inspired by Haskell’s work in the
Pittsburgh subway system.

”The subway has made some
wonderful inroads into using neon as
an art form,” Giangarlo said. ”We
don't think there's another neon
sculpture of this size anywhere.”

Although the SGB has no estimate
on the final cost of the sculpture, in-
stallation is targeted for the end of the
school year.

In other business, the SGB ad-
dressed the board of trustees’ deci-
sion to continue selective divestment.

Childrens Hospital
receives grant for
child abuseprogram

By Brenda Bravis
Staff Writer

Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh
received a $135,000 grant on Tues-
day to help support its Suspected
Child Abuse and Neglect program.
The check was presented to hospital
president Edward K. Zechman Jr. by

S Senator D. Michael Fisher (R-37th

District).

Fisher was active in securing the
grant for Children’s‘and said the grant
will enhance the hospital's efforts to

assist children who are known or.

suspected to be victims of abuse or
neglect.

Fisher called Children's ”the best
hospital for children and youths in
the country,” and said he was proud
to have played a major role in obtain-
ing the grant.

Jack Paradise, medical director of
the Ambulatory Care Center, said,
”We look forward to the opportuni-
ty to develop and improve our pro-
gram.” .

According to Zechman, formaliz-
ing the SCAN program has been*a
desire of Paradise’s for several years.

The hospital has engaged Dr. Lynn
Freedman as director of research and
development for the program. Freed-
man is the director of research and

. planning of the Family Intervention

Program at Children's.

Some of the areas of emphasis for
the new program are detecting early
stages of abuse in children who are
at risk and ways to improve the rela-
tionship between hospitals and local
agencies concerned with abused or
neglected children. .

Although most cases of child abuse
or neglect are detected during a
child's visit to the hospital, Children's
is hoping to work outside of the
hospital in gaining information and
knowledge about children who are
abused or neglected.

The Pennsylvania Child Abuse Law
requires physicians and other profes-
sionals to report all cases of suspected
child abuse. The Children's Hospital
program has been active for nearly
two decades and includes physicians,
clinical social workers, psychologists
and nurses with experience and
special concern in identifying and
treating child victims of abuse or
neglect. J

 

  
  

WASHINGTON — Secretary of

‘ State George Shultz announced Tues-

 day that 55’Soviets have been ex-

 pelled from the United States, but he
 tried to distance the moves from the

Soviet expulsion of five U.S. diplo-

mats from Moscow over the

weekend.

. Shultz said that 50 of the diplomats

7 were ordered to leave to achieve
parity between the number of diplo-

..mats working in both countries.
Shultz said President Reagan wants
to see an equal number of diplomats
working at embassies and consulates
in both countries —- thus 50 Soviets
had to leave.

H Shultz said the other five were
given persona non grata status
because of ”engagement in activities
not consistent with diplomatic
duties.” I ,

I When the Soviets arrested Ameri-
 cangreporter Nicholas Daniloff and
 charged him with spying, the United
3'55 States ordered 25 Soviets to leave the
United Nations in New York, alleg-
ing they were engaged in spying ac-
tivities.

:; . «Then Saturday, Soviet leader

 ' Mikhail Gorbachev announced that

~- the Soviets were retaliating for those

expulsions and ordered five U.S.

diplomatsat the embassy in Moscow

to leave by Oct. 31.

 

 

A Soviet Foreign Ministry spokes-
man has warned that if the United

States ordered any more expulsions,

the Soviets would retaliate.
Gennady Garassimov said, ”This
thing could go on to infinity.”

IRA member to face
charge in England

SAN FRANCISCO — A five-year
legal battle ended Tuesday with the
extradition of an IRA member to
England to face a murder charge.

William Quinn —‘ an American
native who lived in Ireland for nine
years — is accused of murdering a
London constable in 1975.

A spokeswoman for the British
government said that Quinn, 37, was
the first IRA activist to be turned over
to Great Britain by the United States.

Hasenfus was captured after he
parachutedfrom a cargo plane that
was shot down as it attempted to
carry supplies to the Contra rebels’

fighting Ortega’s pro-Soviet gov- -

ernment. _

Immediately after his capture,
Hasenfus claimed he was working for
the CIA and that his mission had been
financed by the U.S. government —
which would be a violation of U.S.
law.

President Reagan, however, said
Hasenfus’ claim was nonsense and
assured reporters that Hasenfus was
not financed by the'U.S. government.

Hasenfus listened intently as he
was formally charged by the San-
dinistas with terrorism, criminal
association and violating the public
order and security on behalf of the
U.S. government.

No details of the evidence against
Hasenfus has been released by the
Sandinistas.

Controversy also surrounds the

American kidnapped
on Beirut streets

BEIRUT, Lebanon — A radical ter-
rorist group called The Revolutionary
Justice Organization claimed Tues-
day that it had kidnapped an
American citizen because he works
for the CIA and the Israeli _Secret

v Service.

A State Department spokesman,
however, denies that Edward Austin
Tracy has any connections with the
US. government.

At press time there had been no in-

1 dependent confirmation of the kid-

napping, and news agencies in Beirut
were having difficulty verifying the
kidnap claim because Tracy had not
been seen for several months.

IBM to pull out
of South Africa

WASHINGTON — IBM Corpora-
tion announced Tuesday that it plans
to sell all its holdings in South Africa.

The business giant has said it
would stay in Pretoria as long as it
could run an economically sound
business and help promote peaceful
change in that racially troubled
nation.

But a company spokesman said
that both goals are no longer possi-
ble‘—— so the company is closing its
34-year-old subsidiary there. The
spokesman also said the South
African division —— with some 1,500
employees — is only a small part of
the company and accounts for less
than 1 percent of the company's an-
nual revenues.

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, October 22,1986

 

Pitt's bicentennial is just pomp and circumstan_ce 

Well, it's homecoming week.
What this column is supposed to
do is, yes, Look Beyond what is
normally seen and read in the rest
of the paper.

A good subject for this week is
homecoming and the bicentennial
pomp and circumstance that's
been added to it this year.

But, in order to look beyond,
there must be something to look
at. Based on what I've seen, there
isn't much out there to see.

Take the bicentennial for in-
stance. It's a wonderful idea and
all that, but only as a public rela-
tions coup.

The University of Pittsburgh was
once the Pittsburgh Academy, and
then it became the Western Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania. ln actuali-
ty, the, University of Pittsburgh has
not existed for 200 years. Thus,
the bicentennial is nothing more
than a cheap justification for
celebration. _

There is no real bicentennial
here.

. Second is homecoming. Alumni
come back to visit the campus
and reminisce about the old days.

ZZZ???

Many would contend that there
is no campus to‘ visit, and that Pitt
is primarily a learning and
research institution. There is
nothing wrong with that — except

when a committee is formed to in-

sert some sort of tradition into it.
The fact of the matter is, there is
no true tradition here. When we
must be told about the Pitt tradi-
tion and how vibrant it is, it can't
be real. It is one of those things
that can't be taught. . ‘ ’
Pitt traditions are things like:

"sprinting across Forbes and Fifth,

avenues, trying to get the heat
turned on in your apartment and
finding a decent place to study.
Hpw many students will you
find saying, ”Yeah, Dorsett was

good, but Marshall Goldberg was

the best running back in the
history of Pitt.” It's an arguable
statement, but you won't hear it
because no one knows who Mar-
shall Goldberg is.

Perhaps the most disturbing
thing about the bicentennial thus
far has been the cabin someone .
had the vision to have constructed
on the Cathedral lawn.

LOOKING BEYOND

A lot of people are wondering
what the meaning of the cabin is.
If Pitt had some form of tradition,

there would be no reason to
wonder.

According to press releases, that
cabin is what Pitt started out as.
That's all well and good except
the only building with any tradi-
tional ties is the Cathedral of _
Learning. When students come to
Pitt, they do not think of how
good it is that we no longer study,
in cabins. .

The Cathedral would be a
wonderful example for the Pitt
oicentennial. Indeed, it has been
chosen as the official symbol.

Ooh. Big surprise there.

Promotional material used to
recruit students, promote the
sports programs and generally give
a boost to the university all in-
clude the Cathedral in some way.

5. yo. Btu »6Qi“iTt+—

The poor‘ building has been
used to death. The worst thing is,
there is very little to love about it.
It's big and grey on the outside,
and dark and grey on the inside.

One can only assume that it is
used as the symbol because it is
the largest thing on campus.

The -tradition at the University of
Pittsburgh rests in its people. No
student, faculty or staff member of
this university has any desire to
call attention to himself or herself.
The people here would rather ac-
complish what must be done and
move on, either to a new project
or a new university setting.

What the people have done for
this school is to make it one of
the best. It wasn't the»Cathe’dral of
Learning, or several good football
teams or some log cabin built
before the University of Pittsburgh
was even an idea that made this .
school a fine place to learn.

It was the people. -

Wesley Posvar, the man who
led the university in _its leap into
high-quality education, is the only
person deserving of some sym-
bolic gesture. He probably.-
wouldn’t accept it, but he certain-
ly deserves it. .

A lot of people may not like the
way Pitt is run: the South Africa «
policy, the professionalism which
separates the sports program from
the rest of the school, corporate
ties, etc. All these things are
debatable.

The important issue is how well-
we do what we do. Dr. Posvar V
has allowed this university to try

out new ideas and make mistakes

in the name of progress. Progress
isn't always what is achieved, but
at least the attempt is made.

It is a sad thing when a universi-
ty tries to become something it
isn't. it detracts from what we are.

Get ready folks,
it's election time

Who are those smiling, well-dressed people standing in the Towers
lobby and outside of the William Pitt Union? Why are they shaking
_.; your hands and acting as if they are your best friends, even though
 you probably don't even know their names? Why is every classroom
‘I on campus wallpapered with their grinning photos and clever slogans?
Well, «it's simple. '

Today marks the long-awaited season opener of the SGB candidates’
campaigns for office. Every year at this time, Pitt's best and brightest

and for two weeks try to prove to the student body that they are best
suited ‘to win the largest popularity contest of the academic year.
You'll hear the same claims that they make every year: ’’If I am
-elected for office, I will do my best to: fight student apathy, to give
the students a voice in the affairs of the university, get Pitt to divest
from South Africa, pad my resume and guarantee my acceptance in-
. to law school.” You get the picture. —
Every year, the candidates become fewer in number and more alike
in their views. This year, out of 13 candidates, only four will lose.
“ The competition doesn't look as if it will be too tough. It's sad that
a school the size of Pitt can only produce 13 candidates for SGB of-
fices. Every year, the SGB pledges to fight student apathy. But their
attempts to get the students active, involved and concerned don't
seem to be working.

As with any election, the SCB elections present an opportunity for
positive change and growth. The University of Pittsburgh needs an
SGB president who will contribute to our community. Divestment
is a worthwhile cause, so is spending thousands of dollars on a neon
sculpture, but we need more. We need a president and board who
I C, will bring a little humor to the job.

 7 ‘ All sarcasm aside, The Pitt News acknowledges that the 3GB presi-
 dent and board members spend great amounts of time and effort do-

7, ing their jobs. We also acknowledge that the things that they can do

beyond the realm of allocating student activities funds and giving
moral support to a variety of causes are limited.

. So, to all of you happy candidates, keep in mind that most of the
   student body has no real idea of what it is you do in the first place,
\ » and unless you do something out of the ordinary, they aren't going
to care either. So try to add a /little humor.

A real politician

Last week brought the end of an era. A member of an endangered
species retired when the gavel fell and Congress closed its session.
After 34 years in Congress, Thomas P. ”Tip” O'Neill stepped down
3, as Speaker of the House. His departure marks the beginning—of-the-
 end of a stereotype — the stereotype of a fat, old, cigar—chomping
ll politician. He is a man who devoted his professional life to public
service. Whether you're a Republican, a Democrat or an Indepen-
, dent, you have to admire him for that. -
His successor will be Jim Wright, a slick, articulate Texan. The
. 63-year-old has been a member of Congress for two years longer than
O'Neill. His political experience certainly cannot be questioned,
though his fiery temper and unpredictability can. Some House
Democrats feel that he will lack the abilityto act as a unifying force
for the Democratic Party, which was a large source of O’Neill’s
popularity.
_ The Democrats hope to maintain control of the House. They hope
to halt the progress of the Republicans and present a unified front
to make sure that a Democrat sits in the Oval Office come 1988.
Wright has his work cut out for him. It will take him many long hours
to continue the work of his successor and fully unify his party.
V ‘Ronald Reagan and ”Tip” O'Neill were never known for their
. friendship. They representopposite points of view but still manage
-, to work together. Judging from a quote from Wright, ’’I won't sit back
passively and react to the president,” egos will clash for therest of
Reagan's term in office.

So everyone's screaming about
something. What is it this time, I ask.
with more than a touch of sarcasm?
They want the university to divest
from South Africa. Why? Who cares?

Now that I have your attention,
there are some points I'd like to make
about the proposed changes in Pitt's
investment policy. Before you get out
the venom bottle to dip your quills
in, hear me out. The poison won't be
any less powerful in 10 minutes. I am
not pushing for the advancement of
racism, nor am I for increased hypoc-
risy in our less-than-perfect world.

When students have embraced
social causes in the past, there were
pragmatic reasons for the changes
they desired. What are the reasons for
divestment? I hear chants about be-
ing on the ”right side of history.” I
won't even touch the obvious irony
in the word ”right” (as in wing?).

I want to speak of cleanliness. I
mean washing hands —- our hands.
Were the university to divest, how
would they go about it? They would
sell their stocks. The i.nvestment
brokers go to Wall Street and absolve
the consciences of the students. '

Academi

The professional football and
basketball teams use college as a free
farm team system for the develop-
ment of their players. Instead, all col-
leges should adopt the Ivy League's
admission standards (and rules for
athletics) and refuse to admit students

_ who are academically unqualified.
The student body of colleges should

contain only real college students.
There should not be any low-pay pro
fessional athletes pretending to be
college students in them. This would
force the professional football and
basketball teams, if they wanted the
better players, to establish farm
teams, such as professional baseball
has, and would also keep out of col-
leges those who do not belong in
them.

Frederick C. Stark Jr.
Bicentennial

I would like to take this opportunity
to congratulate the University of Pitts-
burgh’s Bicentennial Committee on
their latest undertaking: the place-
ment of those ”beautiful” flags on the
Cathedral of Learning. Could they
have come up with something more
aesthetically revolting? I think not.

I am pretty sure that the culprits of
this monstrosity could have
combined their intellects to create
something more serious and ade-

Where do the stocks go? Is the ac-
tual problem helped? Someone —
someone with more profit motive
than social concern — buys the
stocks and continues to ‘perpetuate
the.problem._Ah, but the protestors
can claim victory. They aren't part of
the solution, but at least they aren't
part of the problem anymore.

I can't help but wonder whether
there is a roving band of protestors
assigned to follow blocks of stock
issue, holding rallies wherever they
end up. I think more valid solutions
are possible.

California hasa good idea. Award
contracts only to companies without
ties to South Africa. A corporation in
Los Angeles just lost a $310 million
contract because they continued to
have holdings in South Africa —
maybe a more effective and realistic
approach.

Granted, students don't have that
kind ofpower over the companies
they disapprove of, but they could
look at the impact, or'lack thereof, of
their actions. The issue is somewhat

more complicated than just being on
the right side of history.

I see signs of the conservative chic
o.f the '80s surrounding divestment.
Nothing is more important than the
image we project. We want our chil-
dren to be able to brag that we re-
fused to allow the stocks of South
African companies to dirty our hands.
Someone e|se’s hands, that's fine, but
please not our own. Come on!

Anyone who wants the situation to
improve must do more than pressure

4 the, board of trustees to sell our in-
' volvement to someone else. Social

change doesn't come about when
people refuse to be a part of the evil
they see. They have to be a more ac-
tive force for change.‘

  Star Wars

~_.L..s..~......__ .. .,.

G?

will not
be missed

The following is a satirical look at
last week's summit between Ronald
Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev.

Subject: The summit in Iceland be-
tween Ronald Reagan and Mikhail
Gorbachev.

Problem: ”Star Wars” — We have
it and the Soviets don't.

Solution: Give Star Wars to the
Soviet Union.

It would be quite simple. I mean,
how many times has each of us seen
Star Wars? I can honestly say I have
seen it too many times.

Mark Hamill was great, and-R2-D2
and C-3P0 are cute, but this is
nothing to ruin a summit over. Give
Russia a few copies of the flick and
end this controversy.

It is baffling. People walk around
this newsroom talking about Star
Wars. Some say that it doesn't work.
What the heck do they mean?

Did they get a bad cartridge from
their video rental club? Is their VCR
on the fritz? You got me.

Others walk around this newsroom
mumbling something about SDI.

What is SDI? _

Sigma Delta Iota?

I checked the ’_’Greeks" section of
the classifieds in The Pitt News.
There was something about an Okt-
oberfest — could that have been
another name for the summit?

There were also some ads concern-
ing oxes and apes, but I could not
figure out what they meant. After all,
it's all Greek to me.

  

I did not want to bother Pitt Greek
Advisor Bridget Guernsey (I think that
is how she spells- it) at home, so I
could not find out whether or not Pitt
has a Greek chapter named Sigma
Delta Iota.

I phoned the Theta Nu Gamma
house and inquired as to whether any
of the brothers there had heard of this
SDI, but everyone I talked to said
they were not familiar with a Greek
organization of that name.

They did volunteer to attend the

next summit though, contending that "

they are thelmost diplomatic people
on campus.

So what am I to think? Here we
have leaders of the two most power-
ful countries in the world fighting
over a science fiction movie and
some fraternity. _

Reagan is standing strong on ”Star
Wars.” He won't budge. What do we
do?

I say we offer them The Empire
Strikes Back, Superman and Star
Trek. Sounds very inviting doesn't it?

Throw in a couple of the new VCRs
on the market, and I think the_com-
rades will be looking at a deal they
cannot pass up.

The problem is solved.

I should run for president.

Pat Robertson, Lyndon LaRouche

, and Jim Urban — what a crew! All

we need now is Larry B. Melman.

Unionsget bad rap

Our perspectives on so many
things, which seem set in stone, are
in fact in a constant state of flux.

Take the case of major-league
athletes. We are so used to the idea
of them belonging to players’ unions,
to the idea of them threatening strikes
and job actions, to them being paid
astronomical sums, that we tend to
forget that things were ever different.

In Vancouver, B.C., there is a fun-
ny, quirky, thoughtful newsletter
called Baseball Complete With Spell-
ing Errors. It is edited by a fellow
named Grant Shilling, and on the
front page of a recent issue, he sim-
ply reprinted an old Sports Illustrated
feature called ”Jimmy Jemail’s Hot-
box.” '

”Jimmy Jemai|’s Hotbox” was a
weekly full page in Sports Illustrated;
it began with the first issue of the
magazine in 1954. What Jimmy Je-
mail would do is to pose a question
about sports to a series of people in
and out of the sporting world. Then
their answers would run next to small
black-and-white photos of each of
them.

Many of us remember the feature
with some fondness. But there is
something to be learned from the old
”Hotbox,” too. In the edition that
was reprinted on the front of Baseball
Complete With Spelling Errors, Jim-
my Jemail asked a seemingly simple
question: ”Would a union be good
or bad for baseball?” Although there
is no date on the reprint, it would
seem to have first appeared in the late
19505.‘

”Wou|d a union be good or bad for
baseball?” Listen to the answers that
Jimmy Jemail got:

Dan Parker, sports editor, New
York Mirror -— ”Bad. Baseball players
are individualists. They'd never agree
to standardized pay, even though at
one time, baseball almost had a
union. Larry MacPhail of the Yankees
and Tom Yawkey of the. Red Sox
stymied it ‘ by insisting on raising
minimum pay and the creation of a
players’ pension fund."

T.H. Richardson, vice president,
Little League ”Bad, because
baseball is a sporting profession. As
Phil Wrigley once said: ’Baseball is
too much of a sport to be a business
and too much of a business to be a
sport.’ A union for ballplayers would
make baseball 100 percent commer-
cial and would probably end up tak-
ing the sport out of it.”

Nellie Fox, second baseman, Chi-
cago White Sox — ”A union would
be bad for most of us. I don't see how
conditions can be improved. We'll
get good pensions at 50. Is that bad?
Few persons can retire that early. You
hear a lot of talk about a higher
minimum wage in the majors,
$7,500 a year. I think that will come
in time.” ’

Eddie Mathews, third baseman,
Milwaukee Braves — ”I think that a
union sounds like a very good thing.
But don't get me wrong. I don't think
ballplayers should or ever would

strike. We love the game too much. 1

But if we stick together in a union,
we'll get more benefits. And we may.
find a way to help the minor leagues
get stronger.”

Harvey Kuenn, shortstop, Detroit
Tigers —— ”Very bad. There are just
not enough major problems that can-
not be settled through our player
representatives. I know. I served on
this committee. Even the minor-
league problems can be settled
without a union because the major-
league teams must have strong farm
systems to exist.” '

George Meany, president, AFL-CIO
— ”Years ago,‘|abor rejected a pro-
posal for a union of baseball players.
First, we doubted that such a union
could benefit the players. Second, we
felt the players were not in need of
collective bargaining, but were in-
dependent contractors who bar-

gained with employers as
individuals.”

Chris Cramer, sports editor,
Charlottesville Progress — ”A

players’ union is not the answer.
Elimination ofthe inequitable reserve

 

 

”Mike & Cathy”
Q are in big trouble

Cathy, I'm not ready to be a dad.
Love, Mike.

Cathy, I’d_ rather be safe than sorry.
Meet you at Planned Parenthood.
Love, Mike.

And so goes the continuing story
of Mike and Cathy, two young lovers
who find themselves in a pinch.

For those of you who are regular
readers of The Pitt News classifieds,
you recognize the characters from
personal ads placed by Planned
Parenthood. For those of you who are
not familiar with the plight of Mike
and Cathy, go through your back
issues of The Pitt News and read the
ads.

Once again, Planned Parenthood
has caused a stir without even realiz-
ing that they've done so. They're just
doing their job. People are forever
moaning about how many women
get pregnant before they are ready.
No one seems to want to do anything
about it, though. Planned Parenthood
is an exception. The usual ads one
sees for birth control or gynecologi-
cal services seem too -distant. They're
generally straightforward and serious.
Which isn't to say they're bad; after
all, it is a serious issue. But the Mike
and Cathy ads are different. They
bring the problem of unwed pregnan-
cy down to a level we can all see.
Women in college can and do get

pregnant.

Planned Parenthood is here to help
those who are in that position, and
more importantly, they are here to
prevent them ‘from finding
themselves in that position in the first
place. Planned Parenthood is an in-
credible organization. They do their

_ job tirelessly. The pro-life movement

clause would foster better relation-
ships. Players are little -more than
serfs. A union would be bad because
any strike would threaten the ex-
istence of baseball and discourage
sports-minded businessmen.”

U.E. Baughman, chief, U.S. Secret
Service —- ”A players’ union could
get some general benefits for all
players, but it would be beneficial
only if management were free to run
the teams without player inter-
ference. Anything like a shop steward
giving an ultimatum to the manager
of a team would destroy baseball.”

Dennis O’Keefe, movie actor —
”Good. Baseball players don't have
enough say about themselves. Many
brilliant youngsters are kept in the
minors for years because the clubs
that ‘own’ them are ‘loaded.’ Some
players make the majors too late, if
at all. This is unfair, and I'm sure that
it has ruinedgmany a career.”

F.J. Shaughnessy, president, Inter-
national League —- ’’I think a union
would be bad for the players. There
is so great a difference in pay and
ability that it would be impossible to
set up salary rules that would benefit
all. Right now ballplayers are getting
more pay and benefits than any
union in the world could possibly get
for them.”

clipped out and posted in.major-
league locker rooms. I can already
hear the players laughing; _I can
already hear the owners crying.

points the finger of blame at them
almost exclusively for the decline of
morals in this country. Planned Par-
enthood offices get picketed regular-
ly, but the organization believes so
much in the job it is doing that it
moves on: It keeps growing, expand-
ing its programs and doing everything
in its power to ”make every child a
wanted child.”

Enough of the plug for Planned
Parenthood. Back to the issue of the
personal ads. The personals are an
excellent idea. The actual wording of
the ads isn't too far removed from ads
that one would expect to see every
day. Mike and Cathy seem real. Too
real. '

College women and men are an ac-
tive bunch. Sometimes a little too ac-
tive. Waiting for Mr. or Ms. Right has
given way to waiting for Mr. or Ms.
Right Now. Sexual activity is neither

I bad nor wrong. Lack of common

sense regarding these matters is. Ig-
norance and irresponsibility cause
unplanned pregnancies.

I'm sure that I'm not making any
friends on the pro-life side of the
fence so far in this column, but I will
be the first to agree that over a million
abortions a year is too many. Abor-
tion is a terrible waste of potential.
At the same time, I respect a woman's
right to choose what to do. Everyone
proposes adoption as an option for
everybody instead of abortion. I can-
not agree. Nine months is an awful-
Iy long time to ask someone ‘to take
outof her life. The women who do

choose to put their child up for adop- '

tiondeserve respect and support, too.

Sex after
surgery is
permitted

Q. My first husband died several
years ago ofa heart attack. Prior to
that, he had two heart attacks and

bypass surgery. None of the surgeons _ I

or cardiologists ever discussed sex —
and as a consequence, my husband
did not have sex for his last five years.
The side effects of medication were
no doubt partly to blame, but so was
his fear of sexual exertions.

Now I read that heart patients need
not be totally deprived in this man-
ner. Please tell your readers not to be
afraid to ask what sexual activities are
permissible. If the doctor won't talk,
phone the local medical society and
find a physician who will. There
should be more support groups for
families of heart patients, and peo-
ple like you can steer them to ask the
right questions.

A. Thank you very much for your
letter; a real contribution to the field
of sex education, to have a letter from
a bereaved person with your sad ex-
perience. You are absolutely right.
Physicians have not been trained to
talk about sex in general. After any
surgical procedure, the physician
should sit down with husband and
wife or patient and lover and explain
what is permissible and what should
be avoided. This information should
be given clearly to both, because
after surgery the woman may feel
guilty about wanting sexual intimacy
when her man may be endangered
by it.

The man with coronary problems
must know what is advisable and
what isn't. In your case it could have
cheered his last years and sweetened

your memory of them. Let me say ‘

The mayor's office has formeda
Commission on Family to focus on
community concerns such as teen
pregnancy, infant mortality and
young people's education.

James Simms, an assistant to Mayor
Richard Caliguiri, said a coordinating
body was needed to get all of the
city's resources together.

The original task force on infant
mortality was formed in response to
the high rate of infant deaths. This
task force was expanded and concen-
trated in order to address an assort-
ment of family problems.

Education for teens about pregnan-
cy prevention and for girls who have
become pregnant are two vital points
this committee will focus on. Simms
said the governor's office has
allocated $50,000 and made a defi-.

need.

”For the past eight years, both
higher and secondary education have
been underfunded by the Thorn-
burgh administration,” Singel said.

Singel said he and Casey would try
to change that, especially at the high
school level.

”We want to launch a direct assault
on the quality of high school educa-
tion,” he said.

Statistics, Singel said, evince the
”sad state” of Pennsylvania's educa-
tional system. He pointed out that
Pennsylvania ranks 45th in the nation
in terms of the percentage of high
school students who further their
education.

In an effort to reverse this trend, the
Casey administration would afford
Pennsylvania parents the opportuni-
ty to shelter part of their income
every year in order to guarantee four

nite commitment. The role of the
governor is ”the strongest role of con-
vening and pulling people together
in a leadership role and not a service
role,” said Simms.

”Oftentimes, communities are not
serviced by a health center.” Accord-
ing to Simms, the role of this com-
mission is to raise consciousness and
to provide help for those who need it.

Dr. Sharyne Donfield, chief of
epidemiology for the Allegheny
County Health Department, said
there were |7,767 live births in I985
in Pittsburgh. Infant mortality took the
lives of 227.

The causes of infant mortality are
broken down into two phases -
”neonatal, deaths which occur the
first 27 days of life, and postnatal, the
deaths which occur in the next ll
months,” said Dr. Kenneth D.
Rogers, a professor and chairman of
the department of community medi-
cine in Pitt's School of Medicine.

years "of college for their children
when they reach the age of 18.

”lt’s kind of like an lRA for educa-
tion,” Singel said.

The other major plank in the Casey
platform concerns. economics. Singel
said the Pennsylvania economy is in
need of new vigor.

’’People are tired of complacent,
economic drift policies,” Singel said.

Regarding the South African situa-
tion, Singel said he and Casey strong-
ly support divestment. He claimed
that their opponent, Lt. Gov. William
Scranton, has not made his position
clear on this issue.

”We have called for the divestment
of state funds  Bill Scranton has yet
to say this. He's waffled all over the
map on this issue,” Singel said.

If elected, Singel plans to play an
active role in the Casey ad-
ministration.

I ask force on teens formed

According to Rogers, infant death
in the prenatal stage can be cor-
related with low birth weight, gene
defects, poor medical care, cigarette
smoking and drug or alcohol abuse
by the mother during pregnancy.

”Over half of the causes [of infant
mortality in the postnatal stage] are
attributed to Sudden Infant Death

[Syndrome]/’ said Rogers. ”We know.

almost nothing about this disease.”

Rogers stressed that the main con-
cern about infant mortality is not the
deaths of infants, ”but the concern
about those [infants] who survive and
are‘ in good physical health but in in-
adequate homes.”

The Pittsburgh Public School
System has set up a program in order
to tackle some of the social problems
concerning infant mortality. The
main concern, as Dr. Rogers em-
phasized, was those children born to
inadequate homes. According to Dr.

THE PITT News, Wednesday, October 22, 1986

Paid advertisement.

Open letter to President Reagan and his
administration, students and faculty of the University
of Pittsburgh,and the greater Pittsburgh community:

Dear Mr. Reagan:

it is withdeep sorrow and anger that we witness
the continuous deterioration of American values since

, you and the Republican administration were elected.

We are talking specifically about yourpolicy on
human rights violations and state supported terrorism
against the will and welfare of the people of the
Republic of Nicaragua. ’

Since January of 1981, your so-called covert war
against the people of Nicaragua has ‘murdered more
than 25,000 non-combatant civilians, that is, men,
women and children of campesino ancestry, plus the
destruction of hundreds of communities, schools,
churches, child care centers, clinics, and most
important, food-producing farms.

As you can see, the Contras which you

erroneously equate with the Freedom Fighters of this
country, are nothing less than the remnants of
Somoza’s criminal National Guard. A band of thugs
trained by the CIA, committed to your policy of state
terrorism and slow starvation of the Nicaraguan
people, coupled with an unfair embargo which denies
them any trade, including the minimum requirements
to sustain human life, such as urgently needed
medicines;   ‘ - - ‘ .

On the other side, Mr. President, your office has
directed the agencies of the CIA, FBI, NCS, and others,
so secretly even the American people are-unaware, to
maintain a policy ofstate terrorism and undeclared war
against the democratically elected government of
Nicaragua.   ‘ '

Your office and close advisers have chosen P

purposely to misiniorm and disiniorm the American
media and the American people on Nicaragua and
other subjects, making us doubt in the faith of the word
of America, the pulse of democracy, in Bernard Ka|b’s
own words. ‘ -

You have also chosen, disregarding the opinion

6 poll of the majority of the American people, to exempt

the United States from international law by ignoring
the irrefutable decision of the World Court and
continuously vetoing dozens of resolutions by the
United Nations calling on you and your government to
stop- all aggressions against Nicaragua and repay
material war damages. 6

Mr. Reagan, your own vice president, Mr. Bush,
has been conducting a campaign, with or without your
knowledge and that of Mr. Shultz, that demonstrates
direct and open support for the Contras within the
territory of Nicaragua for the last two and .a half years.

Such actions carried out_ by the CIA in
cooperation with criminal elements are undeniable
violations of the Neutrality Act, the Logan Act, the
Arms Control Act and the 1986 Intelligence
Authorization Act, to name just a few.

Also, such illegal actions intentionally ignore
Congress’ authority thus violating the will of 62% of the
American people who are totally against your war in
Nicaragua and the rest of Central America.

But the main victim of the latest violation of
Nicaraguan sovereignty on October 7, 1986, is not the
three dead CIA agents or the one imprisoned but the
trust placed on you and your administration based on

the American ideals and traditions tor E peace,

democracy andseli-determination of all nations.

In view of these events we must ask you, Mr-

President: who dictates the foreign policy ofthe United
States toward Nicaragua? Mr. Bush, Gen. John
Singlaud, the CIA, FBI, NSC, Southern Air Transport,
Soldiers of Fortune or the criminal fantasies of

fanatical Rambo-styled right-wingers dreaming of,

games of war and terror in the'Central American
jungles? 1

DO YOU AND THESE PEOPLE  
PERHAPS REMEMBER V|ET_-NAM...

Finally, Mr. Reagan, we respectfully ask you and  

the Congresspeople ofour state who support such
criminal policies: Senator Heinz, Representatives

P Koiter, Schulze, Shuster McDade, Murtha, Coughlln,

Rltter, walker, Gekas, Goodllng, Gaydos, Ridge,
Murphy and Clinger; to stop the U.S. $100 million

dollars in legal and military aid to the Contras, to stop .

all CIA and ‘Private Citizens’ attacks against the people
of Nicaragua, to lift the economic embargo, to abide by
the World Court resolution, to respect the resolutions
of the Contadora Group, to stop all FBI _ and

immigration and NaturalizationAgency attacks and [

harassment against those who oppose your ill policies
andto engage in a policy of peace, co-existence and

respect and immediate reparation for war damages to  

Nicaragua. ‘

Unless you change this policy, Mr. President,

Nicaragua and Central America will be added to the
foreign policy failures that have characterized your

administration: the invasion of Grenada, the Middle,

East and the massacre of U.S. troops there, the Libyan

' bombing, your support for South African Apartheid .
and, most importantly, any significant agreement onﬂry.

nuclear arms reductions. " .

Locally, Mr. Reagan, the people of Pittsburgh 9 
have lost thousands of jobs due to your devastating.  1

economic policies. Thousands of area families, not

-only steelworkers, are suffering the ignominy’ of if

unemployment in this rich country and the same
numbers of University of Pittsburgh students have no
way to finish their higher education because ofthe cuts

in government loans by youriadministration while"

millions are wasted in this senseless war against the

people of Nicaragua. ' ,
We believe that our tax money and the lives of.

Americans must be used in better and more honest

ways instead of terrorizing defenseless people as in the

case of Nicaragua.‘

WE ASK vou, Mn. PRESIDENT,
TO STOP THIS WAR or vouns
AGAINST THE PEOPLE   P
OFNICARAGUA
BEFOREIT IS TOO LATE.

Nicaragua, a country whose democratically elected
government has been elected by a greater majority
than yours, a country without human rights violations
and with a sincere desire for peace and the rebuilding
of their own future without the ‘help’ of the United
States. 9

Hugh Henry Brackenridge would
most assuredly be proud to see the
. progress that's been made at the

.2 , University of Pittsburgh.

In 1787 Brackenridge founded the
Pittsburgh Academy, which later
became the University of Pittsburgh.

V The institution has developed into
‘ one of the top-rated research univer-
sities in the country.

Thus, Brackenridge set the scene
for a meeting of the presidents whose
schools make up the American Asso-
ciation of Universities. They met at
Pitt Monday and Tuesday to discuss
issues related to research universities.

According to Mary Ann Aug, direc-
tor of the Department of News and
Publications, the AAU, comprised of
50 universities, meets twice a year —
once in Washington D.C. and once
at. an agreed-upon university.

”The AAU was scheduled for Pitts-

 .—burgh this year,” said Graham Park,

who works with special events at the
university. ”So we were lucky to
have the presidents here for the
bicentennial ceremony.”

Continued from page 6
Ruby Conner, director of the pro-
gram, the Pittsburgh Public School
‘program allows pregnant girls to con-
tinue their education in a magnet

' ‘ school away from their home school.

She said this allows the girl to receive
.an academic education plus special

classes geared to her future needs

without receiving hassles from other
1 classmates.

Tonya Jefferson, a student who has

_ had her child and completed the pro-
gram, stressed that this program
helped her and her child avoid many
social problems. She observed other
pregnant girls had no help and
therefore had to deal with social
problems. ”Some didn't have money
for [diapers.] They received no
assistance from programs for milk.
Babies didn't have proper clothes.
School was missed due to the lack of

’ babysitters. A lot of girls got pregnant

again because they did not receive
the education and helpthey need-
ed,” she said.

Jefferson not only attributes being
one of the fortunate ones to the
assistance programs which helped
her, but also to her parents. She said,
”My parents icare, they spend time
with me and my child.” ‘

Over the past four years, the Pitts-
burgh Press has expressed ”a real in-
terest in infant mortality,” according
to Editor-in-Chief Angus McEachran.
He said they are doing this by call-
ing'for even more emphasis to be
placed on this topic by the media
because of the present statistics on in-
fant mortality. McEachran said the
mayor's task force is one step in bat-
tling infant mortality, but low in-
come, unemployment and under-
education must also be dealt with to
bring results in the continued reduc-
tion on infant mortality.

but their main purpose in coming to
Pitt was to discuss current issues

relating to the universities.

In a series of closed discussion ses-
sions, the presidents were able to air
various viewpoints.

. ”We discussed our image and how

  
   

were seen in Congress, which of
course is always a matter of con-
cern,” said Pitt President Wesley
Posvar. .

Posvar expressed optimism on the
current state of research universities.
He said none of the universities are

Brackenridge set the stage for Tuesday's meeting

having problems with their en-
rollment. 4

”These are the top schools, these
are the best 50 out of 3,000. There
are no enrollment problems at these
schools.”

. Posvar also said the presidents
talked about divestment and that 90
percent of the universities have a
policy similar to Pitt's, which is that

V of selective divestment.

The AAU presidents discussed Pro-
position 48 and proposed changes in
the NCAA guidelines for colleges and
universities.

The proposed changes in the
NCAA include reducing the number
of football scholarships and cutting
the basketball and baseball rosters
and seasons. -

Proposition 48 requires_ incoming
freshmen athletes to have a minimum
SAT score of 700 (or an ACT score
of 15) and a QPA of 2.0 in 11 core
courses.

Posvar said the presidents were all
in favor of Proposition 48 as well as
the proposed changes in the NCAA.

Overall, Posvar said the outlook for
universities in the AAU. is very
positive. _

’’I think we [the AAU] clearly have
the strongest university system in the
world,” he said. ”And it's getting bet-
ter.”

The lunch-time crowd is three
deep at the counter, and the
tables are filled in the back. But
there is only one cook.

”|t’s a system,” he said. ”We
don’t have a lot of people work-
ing here, but they have to be
thinking all the time. We don't

- want people waiting long for their

sandwiches.”

The cook is Sam Dilembo, own-
er of Uncle Sam’s Subs at 210
Oakland Ave. Sam said he pre-
pares all the subs himself so they
will live up to Uncle Sam's stan-
dards. Di|embo’s sub was chosen
as the best sandwich in Pittsburgh
by Evening Magazine's Phantom
Diner.

Dilembo used to own over 10
stores throughout the area, but
now he's concentrating on one.

”|’ve diminished them _all down
to one location in Oakland. l’m
working the grill myself because I’
want to make sure the quality is
the best," he said.

’’It’s important not to exploit the
kids like so many places around
do,” he continued. ’’I could prob-
ably be making a lot more money,
but it's the quality that counts.”

Di|embo’s celebrated creation is
the ”Ultra” cheese steak. Made _

More than a sandwich...

place in Oakland, and there he

sandwiches, and french fries come

originally got the idea from the
’’Philadelphia’’ steak, made by the
Whitehouse Restaurant in Atlantic
City, N.J. He said he brought the
sandwich to Pittsburgh 19 years
ago.

The ”Ultra” has almost twice
the meat of a normal steak sub.

Phi Delta Theta haunts their house for Charity

By Frances Sansig
Staff Writer

It may just be the first haunted
house at Pitt — the first haunted
fraternity house, that is.

The Phi Delta Theta fraternity
house will be transforming itself in-
to a haunted house at the end of this
month to raise money for The Na-
tional Multiple Sclerosis Foundation.

According to Ron Bizick, chairman

» of the event, the house is for Pitt

students and non-Pitt students alike
and will be open for all ages.

”As we know, Oakland is hell right
now,” Bizick said. "We're saying,

why let your kids go trick-or-treating
in Oakland when you can still let
them dress up and bring them to the
house?”

The haunted house is actually a
combined effort of the Phi Delta
Theta, Pi Lambda Phi and Delta
Sigma Phi fraternities. The Delta Phi
Epsilon, Kappa Delta and Kappa
Alpha Theta sororities, are also par-
ticipating.

Bizick said they have invited
O'Brien and Garry and Mayor
Richard Caliguiri as well as’ others,

. and he~is optimistic most will accept.

sity food service, DECA, has become
involved with the. Greeks.

Bizick criticized the Office of Stu-
dent Activities for not permitting the
IFC to hold a wrestling match in the
Fitzgerald Field House. The IFC had
intended to use the money raised to
aid the Harmarville Rehabilitation
Center.

"It seems that the [Office of] Stu-
dent Activities are posing as our
parents. It's like you're being ground-
ed,” said Bizick, referring also to re-
cent policies on dry.rush.

"Student Activities tells us what
we're going to do and how," he said.

Bizick said although he under-
stands the position of the board, he
suggested that the Greeks should
have more input regarding what ac-
tivities should be permitted.

‘'1 think they should listen to us
more — we're [Greeks] the people
that bring interest to this university.
We're also the most visible," said
Bizick.

Bizick attributed the refusal of their
request to hold a wrestling match to
the objectionable manner and be-
havior associated with the wrestling
arena and the kind of audience an
event such as this would attract.

"We guarantee that there will be
no alcoholic beverages at our func-
tion,” he said. "We are going to hire
police to patrol the area.

”lfthis goes off well, not only will
it benefit our fraternity, but all frater-
nities. We want to show the public
we can do good."

THE PITT NEWS

By John Enright

Assistant Sports Editor

Charles Gladman, Pitt's All-
America candidate tailback, will
make his first start in five weeks
when the Panthers play host to
Navy at Pitt Stadium this Saturday
afternoon.

Gladman, a junior who rushed
for 1,085 yards last season, has
seen relatively little playing time
since the Purdue game. Coach
Mike Gottfried benched Gladman
after that game and started
sophomore Craig ”lronhead”
Heyward in his place the follow-
ing week against West Virginia.
Gottfried cited Gladman’s tenden-

He's   back  

cy to fumble and his inability to
hold on to passes for his
demotion.

Gladman has rushed for only 69
yards on 16 carries in the past
three games. He has spent most
of the time on the bench watch—
ing teammates Heyward and
senior fullback Tom Brownget
most of the work.

But Gladman’s inspired play‘in
practice has caught his c_oach’s
eye. ’’In the last couple of weeks,

_ Gladman has had the best weeks
of practice I have witnessed of
him,” said Gottfried. ’’I’m seeing
effort [from him], a guy who is
really working.”

Gottfried indicated after the

Charles Gladman will start at tailback this Saturday when Pitt does battle with the Navy Midshipmen.

Gladman will start Saturday

‘\Notre Dame game that he intend-

ed to work Gladman into the of-

~ fense more, but that it was hard

to do. ”Even before the Notre
Dame game, I planned on using
him more, but you just can't
change [running backs] in the
middle of the stream," said '
Gottfried.

This is quite a turn of events for -
Gladman, who was stagnating on '
the bench since his demotion.
Gottfried and Gladman have had
their share of problems since Gott-
fried became head coach last
December.

Many believe Gladman hasran V’
attitude problem. Gottfried begs
to differ. ’’I think he is a com-

petitor and he wants to be part of
the ballclub,” said Gottfried. ’’I'
don't know if he got down, but
the last couple of weeks he has
really challenged to get back in
there. He wants back in there,
which is a good sign.’-’

Gottfried wouldn't say whether
or not Gladman’s presence in the-
backfield, along with Hey.ward,
meant Pitt would run the ball
more against Navy than they have
in the previous six games this
year. However, he did indicate"
that Gladman and Heyward
would play most of the game.

Gladman has rushed only 64
times on the season for 278 yards,
a 4.3 average.

When Lady Panther volleyball
coach Shelton Collier came to Pitt
seven years ago, he decided to
rebuild the program by interesting
young, high school ”spikers" in the
Pitt program at an early age.

, A trip to the State Championships,

to size up the players was in order.

 

An unpolished — sophomore from
Richland High (in Johnstown, Pa.)
caught Coach, Col|ier’s eye.

Collier noted, ”She wasn't one of

_ the stand-outs, but I really wanted to

add her to our program. I feltshe
would blossom into an excellent col-
lege player.” Senior captain- Sue

. Hoover is now- finishing her fourth

and final playing season at Pitt.
As a senior in high school, Sue led

/

her team to a state volleyball title.

While this helped to confirm Pitt's in- .

terest in her, perhaps even more im-
portant was her involvement with the
Junior Olympic team. Collier
coached Hoover (along with team-
mate Lisa Stewart) long» before she ar-
rivedat Pitt. « ,

~ ”The fact that Shelton coached me
in the Junior Olympic games heavi-
ly influenced my decision to play at

Pitt,” stated Hoover. ’’I became very
comfortable with the style of match
he uses.”

.As a senior at Richland, Hoover
had already established a tradition of
excellence. The trend followed her
to Pitt. Hoover's volleyball career
started as a-freshman. She played the

_entire season.

Track team
at Big East
meet

By Calvin ‘Holmes
Staff Writer ’

As the weather outside gets colder,
the Pitt women's and men's cross
country teams get hotter.

All season long, both the Pitt
women's and men's cross country
teams have been heating up with
dual meets and invitational meets,

hoping to burst into flames this

weekend at the Big East Cross Coun-
try Championships. _ -
The Big East meet is held in Boston

. and is set up so that each team is

allowed to enter nine runners in the
meet. The top five runners out of nine
are scorers.

;. This is an important factor to the
women's team because it is com-
posed of only six women. The com-
petitors for the Lady Panthers will be

Lori Wood, Gloria Azeke, Christian ,

Laskowski, Robin Hubauer, Debbie

Riley and Maureen Pheley. This will.

be the team's ‘second trip to the Big
East meet in quite some time.

But last year the team was put back-
on track due to good coaching". Even ’

thoughthey were-small in number,
they were always competitive in
meets.

Panther coach John Vasvary said,; ‘ V

”The team has developed some

leadership over the past season, and _

[I] expect Lori Wood to be a team
leader.” Wood has been running
well all season and has a chance of

winning the meet or placing in the ,

top five.

The team has seen vast improve-
ments in runners Laskowski, Hubaur,
Azeke and Riley. Phelay will be the
sixth runner on the team. She will be
an important factor because if
anything happens to any of the other
runners, she will be expected to pick
up the slack for the team. .

The men's cross country team will
also be competing in this conference
championship, and they are always.
ready to burn a trail on any cross
country course. The men's team will
be carrying nine runners into the
championships, and all of them have
a chance of running well. ,

The Big East ‘-Conference has
always been tough in cross country
competition. Schools such as

Georgetown, Providence and Villa-

nova have always been powerhouses
in the Big East meet. The reason
behind the success of these teams is
that they all have good runners and
one or two great runners. -
The Panther team is built on th
skill of good funners, but they don't

have that one competitor who can
run to the front and finish in the top

10.

Coach Vasvary will be looking for
good performances from Bob Weiner
and Joe Daniels who are more .ex-
perienced runners. Tim Manes and
Joel Ninos will also be traversing the

familiar five-mile course. This meet--

should carry a lot of excitement and
eagerness for the newcomers Joe
Turner, Gleen Ryans, Curt Vigrass,
Waddie Freemon and Paul Freedick.

Both teams have been preparing all
year long for this meet, but there is
one problem that looms over them."

The Big East meet is held in Boston,
and even though both teams com-
bined consist of 15 athletes and two

coaches, they have to travelto Boston ’

by van. This writer has experienced

this 13-hour trip, and it does affect the

runners’ performance. Hopefully,
both the Pitt men and women will
still endure this weekend.

Editor's Note: This is the second in
a series about Robert /ordan's at-
tempt to make the Pitt basketball
team as a walk-on.

Tuesday, Oct. 7 — One week from
tomorrow official practice begins.
We have one more session of 20-205
to do, but they are always a chal-

’ lenge. Coach Evans said that he

hasn't lost many players to injury
because of the 20-205. I get the feel-
ing that after tomorrow, the coaches
will make their final observations and
decide who they want to keep. Per-
sonally I think they have a pretty

good idea of who they want, but

maybe someone will pop up out of

‘ the blue and make a good lasting im-
* pression. I just hope that the coaches

assess my talent and end up choos-
ing me. I've worked hard. This is my
second time trying out, and personal-

15th of the month. We talked to the
team's trainer, and he gave us some
paperwork to fill out. We have to get
a physical, a chest X-ray and a blood
test before we're cleared to practice.
There's talk that the coaches only
want one walk-on because they're
considering bringing up two football
players, John Rasp (a freshman
punter) and Bill Osborn (a soph-
omore wide receiver). I don't know
how good they are, but I would like
to know. It's going to be more dif-
ficult to make it now, but at least I'm

‘at full strength. I've done all the prov-

ing that I can do, so all I can do is
wait. We take our physicals tomor-

to get on the court and do what I do I

best.

Thursday, Oct. 9 — We didn't play
today because we had to take our
physicals. Anyway, we weren't able
to get a game because we only have
nine guys left. We've had some guys
quit, and one of the guys has a
sprained ankle. I'll go up today but
ifl can't get in a game, I'll leave. Ap-

The Pitt men's and women's ten-

A nis teams recently traveled to Ohio

University for a regular-season match.
Both the men's and women's teams

7-were shut out 9-0.

For the women's tennis team, the

V match marked the end of regular

season play and served as a warm-

up for the Big East Championships to

be held this weekend. .
Possibly one factor contributing to

~',the shutout of the women's tennis
‘ team was the absence of their No. 1

and No. 4 singles players, Jodi Levine
and Carrie deVera.

This forced the remaining players
into matches against players on a
higher skill level. The Lady Panthers
played well under the circumstances.
_ Moving into the No. 1 singles spot

was freshman Tracy Feltingoff, who '

had been considered to fill the No.
1 singles spot during pre-season.
Feltingoff was shut out by Kelley Ar-

chibald of Ohio University 6-0, 6-0.
Stephanie Nelson, a three-year

1 Veteran on the team, challenged Jenni

Blachut in the No. 2 singles match.
Nelson lost thefirst set 6-1. She

played well in the second set but lost .

6-3.

Bonnie Kartzman delivered the
best Lady Panther performance of the
day. Kartzman was the only team
member who lasted more than two
sets against her opponent. '

She played Traci Keenan in the No.
3 singles match and lost the first set
6-2, but she came back to win the
second set 6-4. With the match on
the line in the third set, Kartzman lost
6-2.

Karen Meade moved up two posi-
tions to play the No.4 singles match.
Meade lost to Sheryhl Prominski in
straight sets 6-0," 6-2.

Sandy Casner played her first non-
exhibition season match for the Lady
Panthers in the No. 5 singles position.
She was defeated by Polly Gray 6-1 ,
6-l.

Senior co-captain Bridget Kyle
played ‘her last collegiate tennis

match for Pitt and was defeated 6-1,
6-1 byJanet Bass in the No. 6 singles
match.

The story remained the same for
the Lady Panthers in the doubles
matches, as they lost all three.

Pairing up for the first time together
in the No. 1 doubles match were
Feltingoff and Nelson. Feltingoff and
Nelson were defeated 6-2, 6-1 by
Gray and Novak.

Kartzman and Meade, who are
used to playing No. 3 doubles
together, moved up to the No. 2
doubles match. Kartzman and Meade
challenged Archibald and Pidcock of
Ohio University. They lost the first set
6-2 but made the second set score a
closer 6-4.

Kartzman commented, ”P|aying
two steps up was a challenge for
everyone. I think we played well,
considering the adjustments we had
to make. This match was beneficial
for everyone because when you play
someone who is on a higher level, it
in turn raises your level of play.”

Pitt tennis teams lose regular season finale at Ohio

competitive in the first match, keep-
ing the set score close at 6-3 but were
out-played in the second set by
Danelle Rogers and Laura Karlson
and lost 6-1.

Coach George Dieffenbach was
optimistic about the match.

”This was a positive experience for
the team,” he said. Everyone had to
play an opponent who was a step
above their playing level. This match
got everyone tuned up for the Big
East Championships this weekend."

The men were shut out in the first
match the squad has played since the
Big East Championships last month.

Neil Meyerowich had the most im-
pressive set scores in singles play.
Although losing to Kevin Donvase,
Meyerowich kept the score close at
7-5, 7-5.

Paul Maben played competitively
in the No. 2 singles spot. Mabeh lost
to Dan Trevas of Ohio University in
straight sets 6-3, 6-3.

Greg Campbell played well against
Barry Morton and kept the sets close
but lost 7-5, 6-4.

Rich Monteleone lost in the No.4

singles set to Jay Eatheridge of Ohio
University. The final set scores were
6-0, 6-2.

David Johnson, an experienced
player, was competitive in the No. 5
singles match against Dave Flippone.
Although losing, he kept the sets
close at 6-3, 6-2.

Although a relative new-comer this
season, Vivick Kumar was defeated
in his first non-exhibition match of
the season by Sam Walsh. The final
set scores were 6-1, 6-2. V

The men's tennis team continued
to have problems in doubles play and
lost all three matches.

Meyerowich and Maben played
well but lost 6-3, 6-4 to Donvase and
Walsh.

Playing No.2 doubles forthe Pan-

'thers were veteran players Campbell

and Monteleone. They were downed
by Eathridge and Filippone 6-2, 6-0.

Rounding out doubles play for the
Panthers were Johnson and Kumar
who played No. 3 singles for the
team‘. Johnson and Kumar lost to
Morton and Roush in straight sets 6-1,
6-4.

downs during the past four years.
”The main importance of the game

4 is to realize the team has to ’do it

together.’ It is not an individual’s
sport,” Hoover pointed out. ’’I enjoy
playing with the players at Pitt. The
teamgets along well. I don't want to
win just for me;.l want to win for the
team.”

Competitiveness lends excitement
to the game. It is always in the back
of the players’ minds that they have

to be better than their opponents and

sometimes their teammates.

As a sophomore, Hoover helped
lead the Lady Panthers to a Big East

-title. She was named to the All-Big

East tournamentsteam. Though Pitt
finished second in the Big East last
year, Sue was voted conference
Player of the Year.

In spite of her athletic ability, most
peop|e,don’t realize how tough it is
to be a student-athlete. Most often

overlooked is the fact that the athlete
is also a student. The pressure in-
creases when the team takes to the
road. Hoover, an economics major,
stated, ”You really have to discipline
yourself. It's very important to main-
tain your academics, but it is so easy
to fall behind if you allow that to
happen. ’

”Academics and volleyball are first
and second in my -life. However,
[volleyball] is a very close second.
Sports do not leave much time to
socialize, nor do I have a lot of time
to take off and relax, but I wouldn't
trade it."

Coach Collier believes that ”Sue is
our most consistent, all-round

. player.” Hoover is often overshad-

owed by teammates Stewart and
Denise Frawleyywho are very im-
pressive at times. However, she is
able to maintain her level of playing
ability. Her consistency has paid‘ off.
Sue's performance in the Villanova
Classic earned her the Big East

Although Hoover will hang up her

considering an assistant coaching
position here at Pitt during the 1987
season.

”Perhaps not now,” stated Collier,
/‘but down the road, Sue will be a
real good coach.”

For now, Hoover is looking for-
ward to winning the Big East tourna-
ment and advancing to the NCAAs.

thers on schedule for another Big East

For The Pitt News

Defensive football players are sup-

' posed to be a little on the crazy side.

They like to rough up quarterbacks
and running backs. S_acking_ the

:-

quarterback is like winning the lot-
tery. Their behavior on the field can
best be described as aggressive and
dominating.

The University of Pittsburgh has
two young defensive linemen who fit
that bill. They are sophomores Tony

Siragusa and Burt Grossman.

The two are the best of friends and
inseparable. "Burt and I metvon the
first day of freshman camp last year,”
said Siragusa. ”We really didn't like
each other at first. But then we started
to get to know each other and found
out that we had a lot in common.
From then on, we started hanging
around together and doing crazy
things.”

Crazy? They love mustard on
vanilla ice cream. They each have an
exotic pet — Siragusa a snake,
Grossman an alligator. Grossman
plans to get a squirrel monkey, too.

" They love to hunt, but rarely if ever

do they shoot any animals. They are
your typical Elmer Fudds when it
comes to hunting.

There is also a serious side to
Siragusa and Grossman. They enjoy
visiting Children's Hospital and
volunteering to help charitable
organizations in the Pittsburgh area.

”We’re kind of the Bob Hopes of
the Pitt football team,” Siragusa said
jokingly. -

Grossman, whose first cousin is the
former Pittsburgh Steelers’ tight end
Randy Grossman, feels very strong-

' ly about visiting the underprivileged

children. ”You think about how
lucky we are to have the God—given
ability to play football,” said the Bala
Cynwood, Pa., native. "It's not a big
sacrifice to take an hour or two out
of each week to do something like
that. To be honest, Tony and I really
like to do. it. It's a lot of fun."
Another thing that the two take
seriously is their football.
Grossman, a 6-5, 240—pound
defensive end, has been in on 41
tackles this season and has recorded
five sacks in six games. Siragusa, a
6-5, 255—pound defensive tackle who

had been sidelined with an ankle in- .

jury since N.C. State, returned "in
grand style — making 13 tackles
against Notre Dame to up his season
tota|_to 24. They play on the right side

THE 'PI1T News, Wednesday, October 22, 1986

opposite All-America Tony Woods
and Walter Johnson, who are both
pro prospects — which means op-
ponents try to stay away from Woods
and Johnson and run at Siragusa and
Grossman.

”That was an early concern in the
Maryland game because we were still
untested,” said Grossman. ”As the
season went on, we got more com-
fortable and established ourselves.”

Siragusa sums it up this way: "Burt
and I don't think of ourselves as the
youngest linemen on the team," said
the Kenilworth, N.J., native. ”We’re
starters, and we have to get the job
done!’ _

Playing in the shadows“of~ Tony
Woods could be a nightmare for
some players, but not for Grossman.

"Tony Woods is a bona fide All-‘
American,” said Grossman. ”He is a I

great player. I think everyone on the
defensive line plays in his shadow.
Hedeserves the limelight because he
does most of it. He has great athletic
ability and if you put him at corner-
back, he would probably be able to
play it."

Over the next three weeks, the Pitt
defense will be tested by three good
quarterbacks — Bill Byrne of Navy,
Don McPherson of Syracuse and Vin-
ny Testaverde of Miami. ’

Siragusa doesn't avoid the issue.
He just doesn't like quarterbacks.

"I guess I was born to be a defen-
sive player,” said Siragusa. ”I never
liked the offensive player because
they always knew what's going on.
Even when I played offense in high
school, I didn't like the quarterback.
The guys in the pits do all the work
and the quarterback acts like a pret-
ty boy, wearing wristbands and a
headband like Jim McMahon

[Chicago Bears]. He gets all the glory
and all the women. The guys up front
never get any of that.”

Pitt's quarterback John Congemi is
an entirely different kind of QB, ac-

Grossman and Siragusa, two wild and crazy guys

cording to Siragusa who holds the ut-
most respect for him. I

"If I was playing against John, I
would think that he would be one of
the tougher quarterbacks to in-
timidate. Ifa defensive lineman gives
him a good shot and knocks him
down, John will snap right back up
and won't give the defensive lineman
any satisfaction by lying on the
ground. Even though he is a little guy,
John will stand up to anybody.”

Intimidation is the biggest weapon
a defensive player uses against a
quarterback. Sometimes a late blow
can help instead of hurt the defense.

’’I try to intimidate the quarterback
every play," said Siragusa. "Some-
times you get close calls where it
could be roughing the passer, but I
'think you have to take that chance
every once in a while. If you bang up
a quarterback enough, he'll start yell-
ing at his linemen, ‘Keep that guy off
of me.’ And that can lead to a fight
which can cause all kinds of prob-
lems. The job of a defensive player
is to cause problems for the offense.”

The Pitt defense is currently rated
11th in the country, allowing only
263.8 yards a game. The D-line is
averaging. four sacks a game, and it
appears that the intimidating and
bruising defense of the 19705 and
early 1980s has returned, as ex-
emplified by the play of Siragusa and
Grossman. '

Defensive line coach Frank
D'Alonzo is very high on his two
youngsters. ’

"Both have very good natural
strength and possess great speed,”
said D'A|onzo. "They both played a
great game at Notre Dame and are
maturing rapidly. Both are now
coming into their own. Tony and Burt‘

_are going to have great careers before

they are done at Pitt,”

Siragusa and Grossman have two
more years to crush quarterbacks,
punish running backs and drive team-
mates and coaches crazy.

Walk-on

' Continued from page 14
Monday, Oct. 13 — We didn't
practice today because the team had
a meeting at the stadium. I just shot
around for a couple of hours. I have

no idea of what we'll be doing tomor- I

row, but I am looking forward to
Wednesday. Right now, I'm trying to
stay relaxed and remain sharp. I feel

pretty good right now. I've lost some _

weight, and my legs are pretty strong.
The walk-onsare pretty calm. They

talk of what’s going on this weekend,
and Coach Evans seems a thousand
miles away. I guess it's just as well
because he'll ‘be on us soon enough.

Tuesday, Oct. 14 — Today we had I

a, meeting with Donna Sanft, the
academic coordinator for the athletic
department. She told us that if we
didn't have our transcripts turned in
that we couldn't practice with the
team. Well, I'll turn in my transcript

y Grossman (left) and Burtiragusa.

 

 

and see what happens. Since I
transferred out of the School of
Engineering because of my grades, I
may "have a problem. If I'm notified
that I can't suit up because of my
grades, I think that I. would die,
because my grades got me here i n the
first place. Last year I didn't know
what I was getting myself into. This
year I'm ready physically and emo-
tionally. All I want Coach Evans to
say is that I’m on the team. ’
