Budget planning to include faculty, student input

By Jenna Ferrara
News Editor

Faculty, staff and students will help form the university
budget through a new process outlined by Pitt President
J. Dennis O’Connor at the university Board of Trustees
meeting Friday. ‘

Calling for a university “driven by shared commu nication
and openness,” O’Connor said there had been a “signiﬁcant
amount of concern about the way budget decisions were
made” in the past, with “little input” outside the university
administration or the trustees.

O’Connor described an interim plan for the fiscal year
1993 university budget before the new budget process
takes effect in FY 1994. l

A planning and budget committee, including
administrators, faculty, a staff member and a student, will
meet for the first time next month to develop guidelines
for the budget.

“It is my ﬁrm belief that all sectors of the university
should participate in the process by which policy is
made,” O’Connor said. I . .

In January-February 1992, university “responsibility
centers” are scheduled to prepare budget requests to the
Office of Budget, which will then summarize the

Health Sciences will
now report to provost

V News Editor

To afﬁrm the provost as “second in command at
this university,” the six Health Sciences schools will
report to Provost Donald Henderson instead of the
senior vice president for health sciences, Pitt President
J. Dennis O’Connor said Friday.

At the Board of Trustees meeting O’Connor
announced a university re—organization plan which
would ensure that the university is “driven by an
academic mission.” It will also begin to bridge the
schism between the medical and academic sectors of
the university, he said.‘

information for the planning and budget committee.
The committee will review the information in March-

to the proposal. O’Connor will then ﬁnalize the proposed
budget and inform “responsibility centers” of their
approved or denied funding requests.

In June-July 1992 the budget will be approved by the
Board of Trustees, after the state approves Pitt’s funding
for FY 1993, according to the proposal.

This will “streamline ‘the budget process to allow
dissemination of budgetary decisions on a more timely
basis  The university cannot lose sight of academics and
become overwhelmed by [financial] intricacies and
complexities,” O’Connor said.

“My full intent is to keep [the budget process] as open
and public as possible and include all sectors of our
community,” he said.

But O’Connor repeated his objections to an amendment
to the state Right to Know law which would open Pitt’s
financial records to the public. O’Connor has argued that
the bill would hinder research and development by
opening information to competitors.

Although he “always agreed with the underlying
purpose” of the bill, he said he “could not in good faith”
endorse a “one-size—ﬁts-all approach” to making Pitt’s
records public.

Pitt researchers develop temporary artificial lung

By Jackie Estkowski
Staff Writer

An artificial lung that would provide
temporary help for patients recovering from
infection or trauma is being developed by the
department of surgery.

“The” artificial lung is designed for people
who cannot breathe or whose lungs aren’t
functioning normally,” said Dr. Brack Hattler,
head of cardiothoracic surgery at Monteﬁore
Hospital and developer of the artificial lung.

“Because its function is only to assist
breathing, not to actually replace a lung, its

use should not extend beyond a two-week
period,” he said.

Hattler’s device is about one foot long and
consists of 200 to 500 fibers that are inserted
in the vena cava, a large vein which carries
blood to the heart.

“The blood flows past the fibers by their
natural flow, while the ﬁbers help produce
the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide,”

The inﬂation and deﬂation of a central
balloon, which the ﬁbers surround, mixes the
blood to facilitate the exchange of gases,
according to Hattler.

said.

Testing of the artiﬁcial lung has been done
in small animals and will continue in animals
of the same weight and body size as humans.
“The next step is to use it in humans which
we hope to do within a year-and—a-half,”

Hattler is concerned about blood clots
forming in recipients of the artiﬁcial lung.

“Blood clots form as a protective mechanism
when any implanted device is put in the
body. \X/e’re in the process of developing a

Staﬁ’ Writer

Pitt has produced many famous '

alumni over its history, and one
of its most distinguished is John
\X/oodruff.

\X/oodruff brought international
recognition to Pitt in 1936 by
becoming the ﬁrst Pitt athlete to
win an Olympic gold medal. In
his first year at Pitt, Woodruff
won the gold medal in the 800-
meter run at the 1956 Olympic

‘F Games in Berlin.

\X/oodruff said he felt proud to

' share the spotlight with one of

his heroes, Jesse Owens, who
was the highlight of the 1936

Olympics by winning four gold-

medals in track and field.

It took Woodruff a while to
realize the importance of what he
had done.

“It really didn’t dawn on me
until_everything was over with,
and things happened so fast that
the feeling of leaving a small
town and going to Germany was
overwhelming,” Woodruff said.

The success of black athletes,
such as Owens and Woodruff,
would seem to have disproved
Hitler’s theory of Aryan
supremacy, but Woodruff said he
and the rest of the team were not
at all concerned about the politics
of the time.

The only thing Woodruff was
concerned about was his

A performance in the race, the
reason he was in Berlin in the first
place, he said.

“Personally I wasn’t interested
in politics, and I can say the same
for the rest of the team. All I was

interested in was going over to

win a race,” Woodruff said.

A Woodruff said the entire team
was treated very well during its
stay in Germany and described
the German people as very
friendly.

“We were treated very well
mostly because the entire world
was looking at Germany at that
particular time,” Woodruff said.

Woodruff described the race
itself as unusual because of its
slow pace, which he was not
accustomed to running. He’ had
run the preliminaries and semi-
finals in his usual quick pace, but
in the final race he decided to use
a new strategy.

“In the preliminaries and the
semifinals I ran the races the way
I usually do, by jumping out in
front and taking the lead. But in
the finalrace I decided I was
going to lay back and run in

second position and preserve
my kick for the end of the race,”
Woodruff said.

Woodruff’s strategy was
working except that the slow
pace of the lead runner resulted
in something he didn’t expect.

“Running behind him and the
fact he was running at such a
slow pace I got boxed in. In
order forme to get out of the box
I had to stop and let the
contestants proceed me, and I
ran out to the third lane and ran
around the whole field and got
out in front,” Woodruff said.

After winning the gold medal,
Woodruff continued his success
on the field by winning the IC4A
440 and 880 meter events and
the NCAA half—mile each of his
three remainingryears at Pitt.

Woodruff, who was a sociology
major, described his four years at

Pitt as being enjoyable, although
he had to live at a YMCA near
campus.

“My four years at Pitt were
good, but the university didn’t
have the facilities that it has now,
and now athletes who go there
really have everything,”he said.

After graduation, Woodruff
went to graduate school at New
York University, where he earned
his master’s degree in sociology.

Woodruff also served with the
Army in World War II in the
South Pacific and in Korea. He
spent several years with a
National Guard unit in Brooklyn
before leaving the military with a
rank of lieutenant colonel.

Woodruff was born in 1915

and grew up .in.-Connellsvill_e,.

Pa., about 50 miles southeast of
Pittsburgh.
His athletic career began on

oric games

the football team in high school
during his junior year, but his
parents forced him to quit the
team.

Woodruffs football coach, who
was also the track coach, was
impressed by Woodruffs ability
to keep pace with the fastest
member of the football team and
asked Woodruff if he would
consider trying out for the track
team.

Woodruff said he eventually
chose Pitt because Pitt alumni in
the Connellsville area were
pressuring him to stay close to
home.

In only his freshman year
Woodruff experienced instant
success in his first season on the
track team that was highlighted
by his Olympic championship
and gold medal. But at the end
of his first year, Woodruff was
ready to go back home for the
summer and never gave the
Olympics any thought.

“I completed my freshman year
and I was prepared to go back
home to Connellsville, but Carl
Olson, the track coach, never
told me he was going to have me
try out for the team. The Olympics
were far from my mind, and I

Women in engineering discussed

By Eric M. Smith
For T be Pitt News

High school students attending

‘a “Women in Engineering”

program at Pitt were told not to
be discouraged by the low
numbers of women engineers
because there is a high demand
in the field.

The engineering schools at Pitt
and Carnegie Mellon sponsored
the program with the Society of
Women Engineering. The
keynote speaker, Jill Baylor, is
the national president of the
society.

“I wish that when I was in high
school, someone had a program
for me like this," Baylor said.

Baylor spoke to a crowd of
approximately 235 high school
students, parents and guidance
counselors.

“When I entered college, I had
never seen a women engineer,"
she said.

Baylor holds the position of
assistant vice president at Stone
& Webster Management

Associates, which specializes in
energy distribution and delivery.

A male engineer questioned
the importance of math skills in
engineering, saying he had never
completed a differential equation
after college. ‘Baylor disagreed,
lamenting the reliance on
computers and speaking of the
necessity of knowing how a
solution is derived.

Baylor also emphasized the
importance ofan active social life
in college and beyond, cautioning
that women engineers need not
be one-dimensional. Baylor plays
the violin for a community
orchestra in her hometown
outside of Denver.

She cited studies that showed
only five percent of the
engineering work force is
composed of women. She sees
this as an incredible opportunity
for women and minorities in a
field that is already beginning to
show a shortage of qualified
applicants.

Judy McClellan, a guidance
counselor from Latrobe’ Junior

High School, disagreed.

“I still see it as a disadvantage
because [aspiring women] are
bucking up against the good old
boys," McClellan said. McClellan
said Baylor did not address the
“reality of discrimination.”

The engineering program for
women high school students was
developed by Kathleen Ganster,
director of Freshman Programs at
Pitt’s school of engineering. In its
second year, the program has
already doubled in attendance.

Ganster sees the program as

encouraging. She also views the

shortage of engineers as providing
further opportunity for women.

The focus of the program was
to show young women, parents
and guidance counselors new
options, providing them a viable
alternative to more traditional
careers, she said.

Based on last year’s attendance,
the program is working, she said.

“It’s difficult to tell, but I know
off the top of my head some
young women in their freshman
year of engineering,” Ganstersaid.

Pitt receives Polish

literature collection

By Rebecca Baker
For T be Pitt News

The Polish National Alliance
has donated a $1.4 million
collection of Polish literature and
historical artifacts to the University
of Pittsburgh from Alliance
College in Cambridge Springs,
Pa., which closed in 1987.

According to Frank J. Draus, a
member of the Alliance College
Board of Trustees and associate
dean of Pitt’s Dental School, Pitt
was chosen as the recipient of
the collection “because of its
reputation as a leader in the
teaching and fostering of the
Polish language, literature and
culture  which can also make-

the collection available to'~

international scholars.”

Provost Donald Henderson
called the donation “extremely
invaluable” and said the 35,000
catalogued and the 10,000
uncatalogued items in the multi-

media collection “represent a
cornerstone of academic
excellence upon which Pitt can
continue to build an exemplary
scholarly program.”

About 1,000 Polish books,

* .

magazines, newspapers, records, .

slides, movies and maps are
currently available to the public.

The new Polish collection is
considered one of the country’s
most prestigious libraries of Polish
culture and history in and out of
Poland. Pitt is now one of the

largest repositories of works on,

Polish culture in the United States.

An exhibition of some of the
materials donated by the PNA
and Alliance College is now open
and free to the public.

The display includes 152
samples of artwork, journals,
photographs and books from the

-PNA, Alliance College and Polish-

Americans. The exhibition is in
Room 365 of Hillman library and
is open until Dec. 20.

For The Pitt News

The federal government will continue
the Pitt Men's Study program, which
examines the behavior of gay men and
conducts I-IIV-related research.

Tony Silvestre, director of community
programs, said PMS is concerned with two
major questions.

“We want to know why some gay men
become infected with HIV while others
don’t. We’re also interested in why, after
infection, some gay men quickly develop
symptoms and become ill, while others
stay healthy for a very long time,” Silvestre
said.

“Our research focuses on social and
psychological factors, such as behavioral
differences among gay males, that may lead
to infection. We also observe the
microbiological changes that occur when a
person becomes HIV—infected, and the
effects of various treatments. The HIV
epidemic is having an impact on health-
care costs. We do some research into that,”
Silvestre said.

In its attempt to better understand HIV
transmissions among gay and bisexual
young men, PMS needs volunteers between
18 and 22 years of age.

“We examine the risky behaviors, health
histories, and HIV statuses of men now
entering the study and compare them with
the men who entered in 1984," Silvestre

We want to know why some
gay men become infected
with HIVwhile others don’t.
We’re also interested in why,
after infection, some gay
men quickly develop symp-
toms and become ill, while
others stay healthy for a
very long time.

—Director of community
programs Tony Silvestre

said.

The study is not completed so it’s not yet
known whether today’s young gays behave
differently from those studied seven years
ago, according to Silvestre.

Silvestre said PMS recently completed
another study. “We wanted to know why
gay men who had practiced safe sex would
relapse into unsafe behaviors and then
become infected.

“After interviewing several young men,
we found that a large number had intercourse
with partners who claimed they were HIV-
negative. They took a gamble that the
partner wasn’t lying or unsure. Another

reason was that many used drugs and
alcohol that inhibited the use ofprevention.
A third reason involved mental-health
problems, such as chronic depression, that
led some to throw caution to the wind,”
Silvestre said.

PMS also provides community-education
programs. “We work mostly with the gay
community,” Silvestre said. “We give health-
information posters to gay bars and offer
training to their bartenders. We publish a
newsletter twice a year and distribute
brochures. We help HIV-infected men find

ways to stay healthy longer and provide ’

services to those who live with an infected
person.

“We also do programs outside the gay '

community, usually through other
organizations such as the Pittsburgh AIDS
Task Force. AIDS is on the rise.

“Today’s students will eventually
encounter people with the disease, whether
it be friends, neighbors or co—workers.
There will be a greater need for doctors,
nurses, ministers, school counselors and
teachers to know how to deal with infected
people,” Silvestre said.

The continued research at PMS will focus
on issues such as the role of oral sex in
I-IIV-transmission, infection among young
gay men who have recently come out,
differences in transmission and disease
progression related to race, the effectiveness
of new drug treatments and the economic
impacts of the epidemic.

Voluntary testing a farce

The drug war has made its way to Pittsburgh. ,

School directors in Peters Township decided last week
to implement a “voluntary, confidential” drug—testing
program in its area high schools.

Students who test negative for drugs will be rewarded
with “discount coupons from local merchants” and
permission to attend special social events, according to
The Pittsburgh-Post Gazette.

Taking part in the International Drug Free Youth
program (the first of its kind in this part of the United
States), Peters Township will combine the efforts of the
school district, local police departments and the
community.

According to Peters police Chief Harry Fruecht, the
program was not designed to increase arrest statistics in
the area but to provide -for a “positive peer-pressure
environment for kids.”

The bylaws of the program were created by a joint
coalition consisting of a local chapter of Students Against
Drugs and Brad Carmicheal, president of the high school’s
Student Council.

Those willing to participate in the program would
contribute a sample of urine that would be screened by
patrol officer Dave Stanton, who has been trained in the
use ‘of a drug—testing machine. If the urine tests positive,
it is rescreened. Students then have the option of giving
another sample. If the second sample is also positive, the
student will then discuss treatment options with an as-of-
yet unappointed adviser. I

Although some students are excited about the program,
other people are not. ’

The American Civil Liberties Union is opposed to the
testing. ’

“I find the words voluntary and random to be an
oxymoron,” said Marion Darnick, executive director of
the Pittsburgh ACLU. Damick is also concerned about the
confidentiality of the reports.

Confidentiality, when concerning drug use, is a joke. As
we all know, there are two avenues of gossip in high
schools: The faculty has their own, and so do the students.
Too often, these paths cross. The detrimental emotional
effects and embarrassment caused to a student who tests
positive may prove to be too damaging for repair.

Students under 18 years of age who wish to participate
in the program must have their parents’ or guardians’
consent. If a student does not want to be involved in the
program for any reason, he may be subject to pressure.
from his parents, which would then create problems in
the home environment.

Discount coupons and special social events are not an
incentive for students to stay away from drugs.

This IDFYprogram is just a step toward mandatory drug
testing, which is another violation of rights. Once’ the
school administration discovers that many of their students
have experimented with illegal substances, it is not
unjustified to think that it will claim mandatory drug
testing is required.

Any drug program that doesn’t include education is
merely wasting time. Students must be informed — not
afraid of what will happen to them if it is discovered they
have tried drugs.

Alleviate the pressures of finals

Since finals time is quickly
approaching, Pitt students have
been frantically trying to complete
all the work they’ve ignored
throughout the semester. It’s not
a new activity —— rushing to read
hundreds of pages they “forgot
about,” writing papers they were
supposed to have researched over
the past three months and
cramming a semester’s worth of
work into a week or two of
studying.

But then there are those of you
like myself who belong to the
Procrastinator’s Club. Although I
realize that deadlines are piling
up at a rate faster than a Nolan
Ryan heater, I’ve spent my time
with a few of The Pitt News’ other
writers compiling a list of the Top
40 Things To Do Instead Of
Studying. Read on.

There are several categories
for these activities, so bear with
me;

Studying in an apartment:

1. Stare at the walls until they
move.

2. Watch TV. Remember, ESPN
runs three consecutive college-
basketball games on Wednesday
nights.

3. Clean everything. Wash the
walls. Dust behind the TV set.
Windex the remote controls. Hell,
wash the horizontal blinds with a
toothbrush.

4. Change your answering
machine message several times,
using all different sounds in the
background. Try dragging the
machine into the bathroom and
flushing the toilet while
simultaneously leaving your
personalized message.

5. Wash all dishes and glasses,
pots and pans, even if they’re
already clean. It’s a pretty time-
consuming job. Trust me.

6. You can occupy a good half
hour by staring at a PreVue Guide.
You won’t believe how much
knowledge you’ll gain about
numerology.

7. Open your refrigerator 10
times an hour in the hopes that
somehow more food has
miraculously appeared.

8. Order Domino’s.

 

is af  

9. Order Domino’s.

10. Order Domino’s.

11. Play Nintendo, Genesis,
whatever your pleasure, until you
beat the high score of all your
roommates. ~

12. Call everyone you’ve ever
met in your life. Sit in front of the
phone with your little black book
and pray to Ma Bell. This can take

~ up virtually hours. Remember,

your friends from high school
who are at other universities
across the United States are in the
same studying predicament.
They'll appreciate the long-
distance company.

13. Watch the Discovery
Channel to enhance your
nonexistent knowledge of exotic
animals.

14. Balance your checkbook.
(NOTD _ I

15. Read the sides of all cereal
boxes tolearn the nutritional
content of everything in your
cabinets. Memorize them for
future dieting reference.

16. Entertain yourself by
watching CourtTV. You won’t
believe the sick things people are
doing these days.

17. At midnight, watch “Looney
T unes” on TNT.

18. Listen to every cassette tape
and CD you’ve ever purchased.
This, too, can take up hours of
brainless activity.

19. Remember: Exercise is
crucial to release stress. Every
hour or so, take a walk to Dave
and Andy’s, TCBY or Baskin
Robbins. Food for thought!

20. Devote a solid day to
walking around Oakland,
checking out all the sights you
haven’t bothered to look at during
your stay at Pitt.

21. If you have cockroaches,
set off a bug bomb and leave
your apartment for two hours
while all those little creatures die
mercilessly all over your place.
Cleaning up the mini-corpses can
also occupy approximately an
hour of time.

22. Spend two hours window
shopping around Oakland for all
the things you can’t afford. The
preferred spot for guys (that is,
T}JeP1'ttNews’ sports department)
is Pro Image, while the female
choices are Avalon, TelaRopa,
South Craig Street and Shadyside.
(Okay, so we like a little more
variety than the males up here.)

23. Get drunk and lay on the
grass in front of the Cathedral of
Learning. Stare up at the top and
wonder who in the hell decided

to make a cathedral out of a

phallic symbol.
24. Rearrange your posters.
25. Women: Clean out your

makeup trays and toiletries shelf. .

Contemplate why you’ve saved
empty bottles of hairspray and
containers of three-year—old
Noxema.

Studying in the Towers or
Quad dormitories:

1. First and foremost, go to the
«O...

2. Engage in a floor-wide game
of Trivial Pursuit.

3. Try making four packages of
Ramen Noodles simultaneously
in a HotPot.

4. Overﬂow your toilet.

5. Tie the doorknobs of every
room on your ﬂoor together with
string, and laugh at the people

who attempt to get out of their

domiciles.

6. Here’s a difficult one: Place
Saran Wrap approximately two
feet up (starting at the floor)
around the frame of someone’s
bedroom door. Fill the space
between the door and the Saran
Wrap with popcorn or any other
food item. Amuse yourself by
waiting for the unlucky soul to
open the door.

7. Steal peop1e’s clothes and
towels while they’re in the
shower.

Reason for attending
Pitt not competition

A few weeks ago, a University of Iowa doctoral student in
physics and astronomy shot and killed five members of the UI
community. The student, Gang Lu, murdered the four staff
members and one student because he was upset about not
receiving an academic award. ,

It was not the award that Lu was upset about but what the
award represented to him — a job and financial freedom. Many
of Lu’s friends felt that Lu was under a tremendous amount of
pressure and that he was infatuated with the thought of getting
(or not getting) a job.

I think it is about time that we, as students, realize that our
reason for attending a university is to achieve an education. The

Brett Gilman

recent occurrences in Iowa have put things somewhat into
perspective for me. Just like all students, there have been cases
where I have, to say the least, been very upset with a member
of the faculty (or two or three or four). After disagreeing with
a grade I received, I may have even said, “Do I feel like killing
that ‘&1@!” But I was joking. Who would think that somebody
could actually go through with it? This isn’t the first time either.

These senseless murders just go to show the extent that we
have lost touch with reality and the reasons for education.
Higher education, to most of us, has nothing to do with
cultivating and developing our minds.

Higher education to a college student is simply seen as a
necessary means to achieving a job, financial independence
and, in some cases, a profile on Lifestyles of the Rich and
Famous.

All too often we are concerned only with our grade—point
average and what kind of implications it will have regarding
graduate school and/or the job market.

I think it is about time we start looking at the value of an
education for its intrinsic worth and stop looking at it as a means
to an end, i.e. financial freedom. After all, if you are concerned
only with financial independence, then you are wasting your
time and should not be here. Chances are you could be making
more money as a plumber after one year of vocational training
than you will after four years of college education. So leave
now, before there is a mad rush for plumbing school and it’s too
late.

How come we feel a need to ask the question, “What was
your QPA last semester?” How come nobody ever asks, “Hey,
what did you learn last semester?” The second question would
almost always prove to be insignificant. After all, we only have
to remember what we learned until we take the test. After
midterms and finals it's perfectly OK to forget everything we
learned, right? We don’t need education; we need a job and
recognition of our accomplishments.

Honestly, I realize that college is an important part of leading
the lifestyle that most of us dream about. Nonetheless, shouldn't
we try to maximize the “University Experience” and get
everything we can out of it?

I After all, we do choose a major, at least theoretically, because
we are interested in the subject. Yet for some reason we still feel
a need to bitch, not attend class and get by on a minimal amount
of work. For once, why don’t we do something for the sake of
doing it. Let's join a club because we want to — not because
it looks good on a résumé. Believe it or not, even research for
a paper can be something other than a chore if you allow it to
be.

Wake up! Education, in and of itself, is a good thing. Most of
us are paying at least $45,000 to be here for four years. I would
think that we'd want to get the most for our money.

By concentrating on your education rather than on grades
and a job, the college experience can be a lot less stressful and
a lot more enjoyable. Who knows? You might even be able to
answer a question or two on jeopardy.

Liberals not to hlamefor economy

Recent articles in The Pitt News
have implied that “liberal

. Democrats” are in need of a reality

check. OK then, let's perform
one.

It has been 1 1 years sincejimmy
Carter lost his bid for re-election.
Why then, when it is pointed out
that America is in dire economic
straits, do conservatives insist on
invoking his name as the cause?
And why do they point all the
blame at the so—called, liberal
Congress?

They have had 10 years to
straighten things out, and they
have not.

In forgetting that there have
been two Republican presidents
since Carter and that Congress is
made up of Republicans as well,
the conservatives are deluding
themselves and passing the buck.

Let’s ask ourselves, “Are we
better off than we were 10 years
ago?” It’s a fair question! And the
answer?

The budget deficit is eight times
what it was during the Carter
presidency.

The rift between the rich and
the rest of us is wider.

The middle class has all but
evaporated.

Inﬂation is higher; crime is
higher; drug addiction is up. There
are more unemployed, more
homeless and more P failed
businesses than ever. Even the
yuppie generation is beginning
to ﬂounder. Their new riches, it
seems, are not enough to ward
off inﬂation.

Conservatives have ignored the
reality of the American economic
situation for a decade. Every
quarter for the past 10 years,
we've been told about the
.“recession.”

The reality ignored by
Republicans is that recessions that
go on for more than two quarters
are by definition — depressions.
Surprise! I

The reality is that the last
decade we have been in a
depression.

Now you may well say I’m
quibbling over semantics. But
money is the backbone of this
nation. If the people in charge
can’t see what is going on and tell
the truth about it, how can they
fix it? Blaming a president 10
years out of office won't do it.
Neither will screaming about
"creeping liberalism.”

It is time the partisan politics
stopped. Republicans,
Democrats, liberals and
conservatives all must demand
that the politicians put the United

Program needs support

The Child Care Fall Fair held
Oct. 30 was an overwhelming
success.

The Pitt News article and photo
of a child (Nov. 4) captured the
event well. We would like to
clarify a few points, however.

1. The current child—care center
at Pitt is excellent. We strongly
support that program and Director
Jeri Daniel’s efforts. It is
misleading to suggest that Pitt’s
child—care program is 20 years
behind the times and is not
“good.”

It was the former Pitt president
and his administrators who were
20 years behind the times in their
attitudes toward day care,
especially their unwillingness to
recognize the need for affordable
and ﬂexible-hour care.

2. Much as we would like to
travel around the country
observing campus child care, we
have had to rely upon the phone
and written literature to do that
work.

Stop the judgmentality

I am responding to an idea
implied in Ed Kichline’s Nov. 12
article -"— an idea common in
America today. This is the attitude
that certain states are full of “crazy
people” and should not have
nuclear weapons because they
are “irrational.”

This is ' an incredibly
ethnocentric view. We think
“they” are “crazy” because we
don’t understand their reasons
for thinking as they do. But how
can we make that kind of blanket
statement when in reality we have
virtually no understanding of the
historical, cultural and political
context in which they are
operating? _

Many of these people in other
countries do not understand us
either. Many of these “ir-
responsible” people would say
the exact same thing about us.
(And for evidence, they would
probably remind us that the
[United States] is" the only country

 

which has
weapons.)

I- have been to several of these
countries. The people there are
just like us — they have reasons
for feeling as they do.

Saying that Argentina, Korea,
Pakistan or Iraq should not have
nukes because “they're a bunch
of nuts” is a very judgmental
attitude.

It is not based on fact but on
our prejudices. P

Attitudes like these betray
American closed-mindedness
toward the outside world and
our historical lack of
understanding of other countries.

Attitude appalling

I am writing in regard to Andrew
Fegely’s article on Nov. 18,. I was
appalled by his total lack of
compassion.

He took an unfortunate
situation and made it sound like
Pitt students are stupid. No one
here is stupid, Mr. Fegely, just
uneducated.

You seem to be one of them.
You said “existing shuttle service
is supposed to be adequate."
Well if you had attended the last
[Student Government Board]
meeting you would know that
the SGB has even stated there are
many ﬂaws with the shuttle and
they are dismantling the Pitt cab
next’ semester. '

We have a right to be safe.

As for your attack against the
sisters of Kappa Kappa Gamma,
I have just one thing to say: At
least they are doing something.
They don’t want (or expect)
answers this minute,” but they do
expect someone to listen’ and
take their concerns to heart.

They want to heighten campus
awareness of the safety problem
so something like this does not
happen to anyone else. This is
_not a “Greek” issue; it is a campus
issue!

I would just like to say that I
have attended SGB meetings and
personally spoke to Mr. [William]
Harmon, vice president of student
affairs, about ways in which we,
the students, can make a
difference. I

Mr Fegely, you can so easily
criticize other people for trying to
improve public safety, but by the
way  what have you done for
Pitt lately?

8. Sneak into the Towers
cafeteria when they're not open
and clean the silverware down
there. Hundreds of students will
be relieved at the next meal
when they don't have to hunt
for a spotless knife or fork.

9. Organize a ﬂoor—wide study
session in the hallway. True, it'll
most likely turn into a ﬂoor-

wide gossip and talking session,
but hey —— that’s the whole
point of this list!

10. During ﬁnals week, you
have the absolute right to torture
any ﬂoormates who come home
rip-roaring drunk the night
before one of your ﬁnals. It can
be assumed that these inebriated
individuals do not have a ﬁnal
the next day, so be sure to

handcuff them to the porcelain
God while they're praying.

11. Go to the “O."

12. No. 12 on the “Studying in
an apartment" list is optional.
After all, you just might receive
a phone bill the next day, and
God knows that none of us have
money at finals time.

13. Take up smoking.

14. Walk up to the top ﬂoor of

your building, starting at the
ground ﬂoor. At least when you
pass out from exhaustion, you
can say you did something
worthwhile.

15. Release tension through
sex. I'm not advocating casual
sex, but for those of you with
steady bed buddies, this is your
chance — you may not see your
partner for another three weeks

(over break), so this is the time
to live it up and spoil yourselves.
Well, there you have my
comprehensive list. If I left
anything out that you may do
instead of studying, so be it...

Anne Marie Lucanie is
becoming accustomed to
winning awards. Last year as a
ﬁrst-year player, she won the
Big East Tournament MVP
award. But this year as a more
experienced sophomore,

Lucanie not only won the MVP
award again but picked up Big
East Player of the Year and All-
Conference Team honors as
well.

This past weekend, as the Pitt
volleyball team was capturing
its fourth consecutive Big East
Tournament title, Lucanie
compiled 43 kills and 42 digs in

the Panthers’ three tournament
victories.

Combining both offensive and
defensive power, outside hitter
Lucanie was at the top of her
game. She had an outstanding
.403 kill percentage for the
tournament and was intent on
playing well.

“I’m happy withthe way I

As Dee MacAulay’s spike went
through the hands of two
Syracuse defenders to give Pitt
the ﬁnal point, the celebration
of the Panthers’ fourth straight
Big East Conference title and an
automatic berth in the NCAA
Tournament began. I

Pitt (28—8, 10-0 in the Big East)
fell behind the Orangewomen
(21-11) 2-6, having problems
with passing errors early in the
first game.

“I think [it was jittersl," said
first-year setter_ Annemarie
Mernagh. “Everybody here was
really up for us, and anything
can happen. We were all
confident that we were going to

win; it was just getting into the .

game.”

The Panthers did that, ﬁnally
taking a lead at 9-8. Consecutive
net violations by Syracuse gave
Pitt a 15-10 victory in the first

. game.

Syracuse came out fast again,
scoring the first ﬁve points of
game two. Pitt finally got a point
on a rare service ace by senior
outside hitter Linda Zols. It was
blocking, something that is

usually a strength of the
Orangewomen, that helped the

Panthers back into the game. A
block by MacAulay and another
senior, outside hitter Heather
Hollands, tied the score at 6-6.
Pitt fell behind again but tied it
on a nice deﬂection by Mernagh.
Pitt took a 9-8 lead on a smash
by Zols. The Panthers were never
headed after that, winning 15-

played [in the tournamentl,”
Lucanie said. “I gained a lot of
experience from playing [in the
tournament] last year, so I knew
what to expect.”

With this experience, Lucanie
was solid in the Big East
Championships and throughout
the whole Panther volleyball
season. Her thunderous spikes

sophomore outside hitter Anne
Marie Lucanie, the eventual
tournament MVP. ,

Senior Shelly Seanor gave the
team a 1-0 lead with another
service ace, but Pitt fell behind
again, down 2-7 before head
coach Sue Woodstra called time
out.

“In our game plan, we allowed
for a lot of adjustment, which
we did for the first half of the
game,” Woodstra said.

The Panthers adjusted enough
to score the next 10 points,
setting up MacAulay’s kill for
the 15-8 win and championship
— a victory made easier by a
change in the game plan from
Pitt’s earlier meeting with
Syracuse this season.

“We ﬁgured that since last
time we tipped on them so
much, this time we would mix it
up a little bit more, try going at
them hitting hard rather than
tipping,” Mernagh said.

Woodstra pointed to Mernagh
playing through illness~ all
weekend as a key, adding that,
“I’ve never seen that kid nervous.
Our very ﬁrst match of the year
against Penn State, she said she
was nervous, but I couldn’t see
it.”

Another key was Lucanie, who
had 17 kills and no hitting errors
for a .548 percentage to go along
with 16 digs. Hollands had eight
kills and 11 digs, and MacAulay
chipped in 15 digs.

Junior outside hitter Aimee
Mask led an improved Syracuse
defense with 14 digs. Junior

and scrappy defense won
Lucanie her ﬁrst Big East Player
of the Year award.

“She’s an all-around player,”
head coach Sue Woodstra said.
“She has improved on her
defense throughout the season
and keeps improving every day.”

“P Huemrich MVP as women’s hoops Wins tournament

By Rob Mazur
Sports Editor

The Pitt Lady Panthers opened their
season this past weekend with two victories
in the Hoss’/Red Flash Classic at St Francis
(Pa.) College.

Sophomore forward Jonna Huemrich
was named the tournament's Most Valuable
Player and Erin Maloy was named to the
all-tournament team as the Lady Panthers
defeated George Mason on Saturday, 73-
68, and then Massachusetts, 65-56, for the
tournament title yesterday.

Pitt trailed only once (2-0) in yesterday's
championship game against the
Massachusetts Minutewomen. After Gloria
Neveraz hit a 15-foot jumper 48 seconds

into the game, Jill Colabrese answered for
the Lady Panthers with a 17-footer of her
own with 19:00 to go. Pitt never looked
back from that point.

Pitt went on a 12-0 run, not allowing the
Minutewomen to score again until the
15:00 mark. Trish Riley made two free
throws at that point to pull Massachusetts
within eight points. However it could get
no closer in the ﬁrst half, and the Lady
Panthers took a 12-point, 33-21 lead into
the locker room.

The Minutewomen showed signs of a
comeback, however, in the second half.
After Pitt scored ﬁve points to extend its
lead to 38-21, Massachusetts began to cut
into the lead With 16:53 remaining in the
game, Maleeka Valentine stole the ball

and raced in for the layup. Forty seconds
later Kim Kristofik made another layup
coming off the assist by Neveraz, cutting
the Lady Panthers’ lead back to 13. AT uria
Ransom layup off an assist byjill McElhinny
put Pitt back in front by 15, 40-25.

An 18-9 run by the Minutewomen cut
the Lady Panthers’ lead to 49-43 with 5:18
left to play. Pitt took over, however,
allowing 13 points over the next five
minutes while scoring 16 of its own.

Huemrich paced the Lady Panthers with
17 points and six rebounds. Sophomore
guard Maloy also added 17 points, shooting
four of seven from three-point land.
Colabrese contributed 12 points, six
rebounds and seven assists to the effort.
Junior forward Turia Ransom chalked up

10 points and snagged a team-high eight
rebounds. Junior guardjill McElhinny only
had two points but had nine assists and
two steals.

George Mason gave Pitt a small scare in
its first-round game by grabbing a 47-45
lead with just over nine minutes remaining
in the contest. The Lady Panthers
responded to the challenge. Huemrich led
with 13 points in the last nine minutes.

After the Lady Panthers pulled even
with the Lady Patriots at 49 with 8:38 to
play, Pitt went on a 9-2 run to take a 58-
53 lead. George Mason managed to score
four points, cutting the lead back to one,
58-57, but the Lady Panthers again surged
forward with an 11-0 run to put the game
out of reach with 2:13 left in the game.

Gerald Williams sacks Houston quarterback Warren Moon Sunday.

Untested‘ rookies step to front in

By Rob Mazur
Sports Editor

Before yesterday’s game against
_the Houston Oilers, the hopes for
a Pittsburgh victory were
nonexistent at best. The Steelers
overcame the seemingly
insurmountable odds en route to
a 26-14 victory.

The events of the week prior to
Sunday’s game seemed to all but
extinguish any of thesmall hopes
that Pittsburgh had. First, star
tight end Eric Green suffered a

broken ankle in practice during,

the week and had to be placed
on injured reserve. Green was
seen as the only bright spot for
the inconsistent Steeler attack.
The loss of Green for the year
seemed to equal the loss of any
hope for a fifth victory this year.

Then, on top of the Green
fiasco, starting cornerback and
punt-return specialist Rod
Woodson went down with a
severe hamstring pull and was
unavailable for Sunday’s game.
In addition, Delton Hall was
unavailable to play due to injury.

These injuries depleted an
already weak secondary, which
has been the sore spot of the
defense all year. Now it would
have to play against one of the

26-1 4 Steeler victory

top passing offenses in the
National Football League without
two of its top players. The chance
of a blowout by the powerful
Houston attack seemed very
good.

However these problems never
really hurt Pittsburgh much for
one reason: The three rookies
that started in place of Green,
Hall and Woodson all had
outstanding performances,
helping the Steelers stun the
Oilers.

Rookie Shawn Vincent, out of
Akron University, stepped
forward for the Steeler secondary,
picking off two of Moon’s passes
and returning them for a total of
52 yards. Vincent was up against
the task of defending Earnest
Givins, Haywood Jeffires and
Drew Hill, three receivers who
always cause Pittsburgh major
problems.

In addition to his two
interceptions, Vincent also had
two tackles and two pass
defenses. .

“I’ve dreamed about having
this kind of day on the field ever
since I got here,” Vincent said.
“You just come out here and try
your best and try your hardest
when you get your shot. The
coaches and the players all said
that they had confidence in me
before the game, and I just wanted
to show them that I could do it.”

Two other rookies stepped
forward to help fill Green’s shoes
at tight end. Adrian Cooper, who
caught the first touchdown pass
of his career last week against the
Redskins, grabbed three
O'Donnell offerings for 35 yards.
Keith Cash, added to the roster
before the game, also caught a
pass for a 20-yard gain.

While the yardage numbers of
these two are far below Green’s
on the season, the catches they
made were at crucial points.
Cash’s catch came on a second-
and—nine play during the first
drive. It allowed the Steelers to
move into Houston territory,

something they were unable to
do much of last week.

Cooper’s catches came on
critical third-down plays. On the
first Pittsburgh drive of the second
half, Cooper caught a pass on
third and six for a first down. That
kept the drive alive that resulted
in a Warren Williams touchdown
run. Cooper’s next two catches
came on third-and-five plays. The
first got the ball to the Houston 32
before Williams fumbled. The
second led to the Gary Anderson
field goal that provided for the
final margin.

Overall, the Pittsburgh defense
set the tone for the day. It made
the key plays when it had to and
held the Oilers to two
touchdowns. The defense picked
Moon off five times (twice by
Vincent, twice by safety Thomas
Everett and once by linebacker
Bryan Hinkle), the most Moon
has been intercepted in a game
since the Steelers snagged four
against him last year.

“You’ve got 60 minutes to play
out there,” said linebacker Greg
Lloyd. “You have to go out there
and shoot your wad. It doesn’t
mean anything if you stand
around saying, ‘I should’ve done
this or that.’ You just have to go
out and give it your all.”

Pittsburgh head coach Chuck
Noll also praised a defensive effort
that resulted in the highest
takeaway ratio (+4) of the year
and helped pick up the offense.

“It was an outstanding
defensive effort today,” Noll said.
“The defense came out and set
the tone, and the offense did
what they had to do. The weather
was more conducive to a running
attack, and we tried to take
advantage of that.”

While Noll was happy with
Sunday’s performance, he said
he realized that his team is up
against a wall. “This was like a
playoff game for us, and it wasn’t
for them,” Noll said. “We’ve got
to play like that the rest of the
year if we want to be successful.”

Pitt Win at Kentucky indicative of defensive abilities

For those of you who watched
Pitt’s beating of Kentucky last
Friday, I pose the question: Was
it really surprising? For my money,
yes and no. Before you start
screaming, “Cop out,” I’ll explain.
0 Take Kentucky’s anemic
three—point shooting (6-54) and
Pitt’s determined intensity, and it
becomes clear that the Panthers
won so easily. But add to those
two the Wildcats’ stubborn refusal
to change their failing offense,
and it is no wonder the fans at
Rupp Arena are a tad bit upset.
0 Another factor making it
surprising and yet not so
surprising was that Paul Evans
outcoached Rick- Pitino. Yes,

outcoached. Evans did not pull
any masterful strokes of genius,
but Pitino’s shameful lack of
adjustment spelled his team’s
doom. To give an example, why
didZKentucky wait until late in the
second half to switch from man-
to-man pressure to zone pressure
on defense? It was clear that the
Wildcats were not going to stop
the dribbling of Sean Miller and
Jerry McCullough without extra
help. Yet Pitino stood by and
watched as Kentucky’s alleged
full-court pressure withered under
the outstanding leadership of
Miller. .

0 In the not-so—surprising
department, it generally follows

Derek
Willis
that a good defensive team will
beat a good offensive team. When
Kentucky started missing all those
perimeter jump shots, there wasn’t
much else to do._ And while Pitt's
offense has never been mistaken
for poetry in motion, its defense
was a thing of beauty. Singling
out people would be a mistake,
for nearly every Panther displayed
the aggressive attitude required
by Evans. The only a ggressiveness
that Kentucky showed was its
natural penchant for jacking up

2S~footers.

0 Anotherunsurprising factwas
the obvious size advantage that
Pitt enjoyed. Jamal Mashburn was
the only Kentucky player to play
like he'was actually 6—feet, 7-
inches tall. The rest were just
shooters masquerading as
forwards. Not only were the
Wildcats small, but even the
bigger ones showed an allergic
aversion to the paint area,
allowing the 5-11 McCullough,
among others, the opportunity to
grab an offensive rebound.

0 And while the offensive
output by Pitt was impressive, it
was not surprising that Darren
Morningstar led the team in

scoring. For one thing, he seemed
to be on the court forever. For
another, he was closest to the
basket at any given time.
Kentucky’s post defense had little
help, and even that normally came
too late.

0 Perhaps the best thing about
this game was watching Pitino go

crazy on the sidelines and still do ‘

nothing right. Actually, the very
best thing was watching Evans
really coach. For those ofyou out
there who had your doubts (and
I am among that number), it
seems the man can coach, but
perhaps he needed a bigger
challenge, like the one he had at

Navy.

Flatch regains top diving form

By Brian Gallagher
Staﬁ’ Writer

A nagging pinched nerve in her right knee
could not keep Donna Flatch, Pitt’s top diver,
from making it through the ’91—’92 diving season.
Her perseverance eventually resulted in two
second—place finishes at the Big East meet.

So after successful off-season surgery, why
did Flatch miss the team’s season-opening meet
against Duquesne? Easy opponent? Letting first-
year divers compete? Slow recovery from the
surgery? Butterﬂies about competing again?

Not even close. Try Organic Chemistry.

A junior majoring in biology, FIatch’s fall
schedule includes three labs, one of which
happens to meet on Friday afternoon; thus the
conflict with the Duquesne meet.

“I have a really tough schedule this semester,”
said Flatch, who said the situation, was
unavoidable.

Flatch has returned to lead a talented but
inexperienced group of women’s divers to a fast
start this season. But before this happy ending,
Flatch endured a season full of pain and
uncertainty, topped off with surgery on May 10
of this year.

Flatch first noticed something wrong last
summer. “I noticed [the pain] during the summer
after my freshman year,” Flatch said. “First it was
in my foot, and then it moved up my leg.”

In a sport which depends heavily on reliable
leg and foot strength, Flatch found the injury
particularly debilitating. The injury of her right
leg affected her most important foot for diving:
her takeoff foot. Without feeling in her foot,
Flatch found it increasingly difficult to sustain
the high level of performance she established
during an excellent rookie season, when she
was named Big East Diver of the Year. Add to
it the three-practice limit per week, it’s no
wonder she had difficulty keeping sharp.

Flatch's knee was the first major injury of her
career, which began at a local swim club near
her hometown of Warrington, Pa., at the age of
9. Flatch’s initial interest in the sport had more
to do with her sweet tooth than the fascination

of spinning in mid-air. Flatch said older swim-
club members told her, “If you do this dive, then
we'll get you a candy bar.”

Flatch said her real inspiration for taking the
sport seriously was provided by Tricia Ney, a Pitt
grad who holds the women’s 3—meter record.
They both attended the same high school, and it
was Ney who introduced Flatch to her_ current
coach, Julian Krug.

Krug remembered his first impressions of Flatch.
“She had talent,” Krug said. “She always had
talent but had not performed up to her capabilities
at that time.”

Seeing a true talent, Krug took Flatch under his
guidance during her junior-high years. Flatch
spent the summers with Ney in Pittsburgh and
gradually grew to like the coach and the school.
For Flatch, the choice to come to Pitt was
academic. “With knowing the coach and spending
time in Pittsburgh, it already felt like home.”

Then after a brilliant first year at Pitt, the injury
bug hit. As Krug saw it, Flatch’s season was one
of frustration and uncertainty, due mostly to the
fact that the injury wasn’t diagnosed until after
the season. “It clearly hampered her diving,”
Krug said, adding that besides the injury being
physically debilitating, it also took a mental toll.
“It was that feeling of ‘What is wrong?’ The fact
that she hung in and did as well as she did was
a credit to her,” Krug said.

Also to Flatch’s credit is her determined return
to first-year form. Returning for the St. Bonaventure
meet on Nov. 1, Flatch recovered from a poor
showing in the one-meter to take her favorite
event, the three-meter board. Flatch hasn’t looked
back. The next afternoon Flatch swept both
events in Pitt’s loss to Syracuse. In her last meet
against Virginia, she was again brilliant in defeat,
taking a first and second in another losing effort.

“Against Virginia, she had an excellent meet,”
Krug said. “She is doing some of the best diving
she’s done in her life right now.” -

While he is happy with her progress so far,
Kru g said Flatch still hasn’t reached her potential..
“We’ve had high hopes from the beginning that
she'd be an NCAA All-American,” Krug said. “We
have not achieved that yet.”

Continued from page 9
Annie Parisien, an all-conference
selection, had the team high with
15 kills. The other all-conference
player, Jessica Paarlberg,
struggled with only one kill and
a -. 167 percentage. JuniorAndrea
Carson had been having an
outstanding tournament, but she
had only five kills and a —.086
percentage. ‘

Pitt didn’t get much of a
challenge from any opponent; it
didn’t lose a game ‘in the
tournament. One team that
seemed capable of giving Pitt a
challenge in the semifinals was

Providence. It had been the only‘

team to even win a game against
the Panthers this season and was
coming in on a high after an
emotional upset of Georgetown
in the first round. Pitt, on the
other hand, was coming off a
rather easy pasting of hapless
Boston College earlier in the day.

Providence hung around for a
while in a match full of sideouts,
but Pitt still rolled 15-7, 15-3, 15-
5. The scores in the first and third
games were only that close
because of ﬁve service errors in
each game. Both teams had 148
attack chances, fairly high for a
three—game match, but the
Panthers had 54 kills compared
to only 30 for the Lady Friars.

Lucanie was again the main
weapon with 21 kills and 17 digs.
Seanor had a career- and match-
high 19 digs. MacAulay had 11
kills and five digs, and Hollands
chipped in with eight kills and 10
digs. ,

The conference Rookie of the
Year, Providence’s Aileen
Koprowski, had little effect with
four kills and an .080 percentage.
Sophomore Missy Dawson
topped the Lady Friars in kills
with eight but also had 10 hitting
errors.

The road to that match for the
Panthers was very smooth but
not very pretty. Boston College
won the first point of the first-
round match and didn’t even win
another point until the third game.
After Pitt had won the first two
games by scores of 15-1 and 15-
0, Woodstra yanked her starters.
Senior co—captainSue Zonneville,
after racking up a match—high six
kills and zero errors, Lucanie (five
kills, nine digs) and Zols sat out
the third game. MacAulay played
sparingly. When the Panthers had

taken a comfortable lead,
Mernagh was replaced at setter
by Hollands, an outside hitter. It
was only the second time
Mernagh has come out of a match
all season. Pitt won the game 15-
6.

At that time Providence and
Georgetown were playing the
most hard-fought match of the
tournament. Despite an
outstanding performance from
Georgetown’s all-conference
selection, outside hitter Simone
Kollmann (27 kills, 22 digs), the
Lady Friars won in four games,
15-9, 2-15, 15-12, 15-12. Dawson
led the way for Providence with
16 kills and 21 digs. Koprowski
had eight kills and 20 digs.

Syracuse reached the ﬁnals with
an upset of second—seeded
Villanova (31-6) in three games,
15-9, 15-11, 15-4. Carson (11 kills,
12 digs) and Parisien (13 kills,
nine digs) keyed an efficient win
with 45 kills and only nine hitting
errors.

Both teams struggled in their
first-round matches earlier in the
day. Connecticut (10-18) slammed
Villanova 15-3 in its first game
before the Wildcats won the next
three 15-7, 15-2, 15-13.
Sophomore Becky Kulbago had
14 kills and 11 digs for Villanova,
and all-conference outside hitter
Pam Clifford added 13 kills and
four digs. Kim Lobach of UConn
had the match high in kills with
16 and digs with 17.

Syracuse also won its first-round
match against Seton Hall (17-15)
in four games, 15-11, 15-3, 9-15,
15-1. Mask (18 kills, a .538
percentage, and seven digs) and
Carson (14 kills, .478 percentage,
15 digs) had outstanding matches.

There was little questioning
the outstanding player of the
tournament. Lucanie became the
first player to .. win it for two
straight seasons, and she is only
a sophomore. She is just adding
to her hardware for the season,
having also won the regular-
season MVP. She joined
Zonneville on the all-conference
team.

The New Mexico Tournament
is next for Pitt on Friday and
Saturday. The team will play
Arizona and Arkansas State as
well as host New Mexico. The
Panthers’ Big East title clinches a
spot for them in the NCAA
Tournament.

Penguins suffer from lackﬁuster home play over weeken

By Brian Berger

Showcase Editor

For about eight minutes on
Saturday night the Pittsburgh
Penguins decided to play hockey
and earned themselves a point
and a two-all tie with the new-
look New York Islanders.

If a tie is the equivalent of
kissing your sister, the Pens flirted
dangerously with incest on
Saturday night in front of the
sold—out Igloo faithful.

After allowing two first-period
goals, Tom Barrasso and the Pens
blanked the Isles the rest of the
way and set the stage for ex-
Islander legend and now—Penguin
spiritual leader Bryan Trottier’s
fourth goal of the season.

Playing uninspired and sloppy
hockey, the Penguins exploded
in the game’s final six minutes.
Surged by Ronnie Francis’ (gasp!)
second goal of the campaign at
15:32 from an impossible angle,
relief set in for the frustrated
Pens, who were unable to beat
(gasp!) Steve (this is my best

game in) Weeks until Francis’
shot found the back of the net.

From there the Pens pounded
the puck deep into Islander
territory, where Jamie Leach
(gasp!) found the disc and fired it
through the crease. It found the
blade of Trottier’s stick and
deflected low and between the
pads of Weeks.

Weeks, who earned the No. 1
star in the game and the
complimentary Foodland Player
of the Game award, turned away
35 Penguin shots in his seventh
start this season.

Weeks was spectacular in the
third period, making three or
four sprawling saves as the Isles
were shorthanded, including a
gloving of Kevin Stevens’ snap
shot from five feet away.

The save went upstairs to the
still—incompetent goal-replay
system, where it was determined
that Weeks wasn’t behind the
goal line.

But much of Weeks’ help came
from the Penguins themselves,
who for two and a half periods

played like mud and showed a
serious lack of concentration.
Mark Recchi continued to
struggle, getting no quality shots
and watching the puck hop over
his blade numerous times.

Mario Lemieux, who hasn't
found the twine in four games
now, seemed hesitant, not sure
when to pass orshoot and, when
shooting, not getting good wood
to his shot.

Credit goes to the Islander
defense, which effectively stood
the Pens up at the bluelines and
effectively backchecked, adding
to the Pens’ sloppy play.

This is clearly not the same
team the Pens had beaten twice
earlier in the year. Dumping Pat
Lafontaine to Buffalo and Brent
Sutter to Chicago has brought the
Islanders newfound depth on
offense and defense.

New York now has three
legitimate lines, four solid
defensemen and some good,
young goauending. Ex-Sabre
Benoit Hogue looked strong last
night, scoring the Isles’ first goal,

as did Pierre T urgeon, who set
up Brad Delgarno’s second. (and
the Islanders’ second) goal. They
are not even close to being
formidable challengers yet, but
the Islanders made a couple of
solid moves to improve their
franchise.

As for Pittsburgh, it is still early,
but the Pens need to play much
better hockey at home. They are
relying on the comeback like
junkies.

They don’t show up for over
half the game and don’t shoot
enough. But let’s not panic. Last
season the Pens struggled at home
early in the season, before Bob
]ohnson’s system and Tommy B
became unstoppable after the
new year.

Still, there is a lack of
concentration and hot doggin’
that is plaguing the Pens on home
ice.

While the Capitals are burnin’
up the Patrick, the Pens continue
to flirt around the .500 mark at
10-8-4. The Islanders remain in

sixth place, although a point out

of fifth at 7-11-3.

Ground Bird Droppings:
Jaromir jagr has quickly become
a fan favorite around the league,
leading all Wales Conference
wingers in voting for this year’s
al1—star matchup in Philly, while
Kevin Stevens (who is currently
sixth in the voting) continues to
lead the NHL in points with 35.

The Penguins’ power play has
again fallen asleep. Despite
ranking sixth on the road, the
Pens are striking at a disturbing
15.4—percent clip at home, going
11-82.

Overall they are 0 for their last
13 and two for their -last 51.
Pathetic.

The Pens are now 4-7-2 when
trailing after two frames 7- an
encouraging number but one that
is too high in numbers. At 6-0-1
going into the third with the
edge, the Pens need to set their
game alarms a lot earlier.

A fat, negative shout out to
myself, who has been slacking
on Penguin coverage. I’m back,
though, so keep your eyes glued.

dominated team adds some
pressure to a rising star like
Lucanie. “I think I'm expected to
do well, but everybody is really
dependent on each other,”
Lucanie said about her role on
Pitt’s closc—knit team.

“She puts a lot of pressure on
herself but channels it into a
positive manner,” Woodstra said.
This type of channelling helped
Lucanie to be named to the Big
East All—Conference Team.

One of three outside hitters on
this all-star team, Lucanie ﬁnished
second in the Big East with 406
kills and averaged 4.4 kills per
game. Those numbers dwarf
I.ucanie’s Big East statistics from

Continued from page 3
never even considered trying out
for the Olympic team until Coach
Olson said he wanted me to try
out for it,” Woodruff said.

Woodruffwas honored in 1966
by being named a Varsity
Letterman ofDistinction at Pitt as
well as being inducted into the
National Track and Field Hall of
Fame in 1978.

Woodruff retired from the job
Corps in 1978, where he worked
with disadvantaged children.
Woodruff, who is now 76 years
old, still keeps busy officiating
high school and college track
meets near his home of I-East
Windsor, NJ.

He was also honored in 1982
during the Pitt Invitational Track
and Field Meet, when the 880-
yard run was named after him.

Woodruff donated his Olympic
gold medal as well as other
memorabilia of the 1936
Olympics to Conncllsvillc High
School in 1976.

Last year on Oct. 27, Woodruff
presented his medal to Pitt during
halftime ceremonies at the Pitt-

a year ago, but last season an
ankle injury limited her amount
of play. This season no limits
were placed on the Panthers’ left-
handed outside hitter.

“I am grateful my ankle held
out this season,” Lucanie said
about her nagging injury. She
explained that she kept hoping
her ankle would make it through
the regular season, the Big East
Championships and into the
NCAA tournament. It has, and it
has enabled Lucanie to lead the
Panthers to a Big East
Championship and a berth into
the NCAA tournament.

1.ucanie’s play often excites the
crowd. It is her earth—shattcring
spikes that make the spectators

go crazy. But Lucanie admits it is
her defense which excites her.
“I really don't like spiking,”
Lucanie said. ‘‘I like to play
defense; it is more challenging to
me.” It is within this facet of the
game that Lucanie has worked
harder and completed her skills

on the court. These skills have

shown, as Lucanie finished
second in the conference with an
average of 3.82 digs per game
and 555 overall.

Completing these skills and
sweeping the Big East awards,
Lucanie has become respected
by her Big East foes and her
tearnmates — a respect that
should offer her All-American
status in the future.

Pitt vs Penn State. It is one of College football’s storied
rivalries, an annual Pennsylvania gridiron Civil War that for nearly
100 years has pitted highschool teammates against one another,
has arrayed brother vs brother, has seen father’s play at one
school and sons at another. And it looks as though this game
will be the last Pitt vs Penn State game hosted in our stadium.

And—if nostalgia doesn’t ﬂoat your ducks everybody
knows that Penn State is the team you love to hate! So, Come on
down, as Oval Would say, and Get Psyched! A
