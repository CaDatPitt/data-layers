UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Seminar addresses hate crimes

By Lou Grieco
Senior Staff Writer K

City Councilman Dan Cohen
and U.S. Representative William
Coyne both spoke about
upcoming legislation designed to
combat prejudice at the Hate
Crimes Symposium held at the
Law School on Saturday.

“I think that the perception is
that Pittsburgh is relatively tolerant
on this issue, and I’d like to
shatter that perception,” Cohen
said. “The reality is that we do
have hate crimes.” He mentioned

Yugoslavian
official says
economic
reforms

successful

By Jeff Tatusko
Staff Writer

During his speech Friday in
Forbes Quadrangle, Zivko Prego,
deputy prime minister of
Yugoslavia, talked about his
country’s economic recovery. ' ‘

Prego, accompanied by the new
Yugoslavian ambassador to the
United States, Dzevad
Mujezinovic, was in Pittsburgh
for a business luncheon‘ when he
stopped off at Pitt. He gave his
speech courtesy of
department of economics and
the department of Russian and
East European studies.

“When Prime Minister Markovic
took over 11 months ago, our
country faced three major
dilemmas,” Prego said. “First off,
what kind of economic and
political reforms, if any, were we
to install? Secondly, should we
start by working with our
economy first or should we
immediately attack our inﬂation
rate [of 1,500 percent]? Finally,
how do .we act with our six
republics and the two
independent provinces in our
country?”

The Markovic government
decided to install some economic
reforms before going after the
inﬂation rate. They installed bills
to make property equal and to
deregulate the economy, changed
rules for foreign businesses,
changed labor and capital laws
and started using other economic

systems.

North Hills.

Cohen also addressed theGay
Rights Ordinance introduced by
five members of city council last
week. “It adds three words, ‘and
sexual orientation’ [to Title six,
article five of the Pittsburgh City
Code]. ” The code already protects
members of other minority groups
and women.

“The most
misconception is

common
that [the

ordinance] will give gays and

lesbians greater rights than
heterosexuals,” he added. “’I'hat’s
not true. It is an equal-rights bill.
It provides gays and lesbians the
same rights others have.

“It just says you can’t
discriminate against gays, just as
you can’t discriminate a‘gainst
blacks and other minorities. It’s
not going to create unisex
bathrooms or the other things
you hear.”

Cohen also said that he expects
a political backlash from city
residents who are against gay
rights. He acknowledged that all
of the co—sponsors of the bill
have received hate letters.

“There is a significant
population of people in
Pittsburgh who are opposed to
the ordinance and would vote
against [a member of city council]

Ryan said.

Crimes against Women
accepted, states prof

Violence against women is widely accepted in today's culture
in which women are oppressed and seen as inferior to men,
according to a University of Pittsburgh psychology professor.

Kathryn Ryan, Ph.D., who studies mostly college-age people,
stated the three most—important and most— common forms of
violence against women are rape, spouse abuse and sexual
harassment. The dispute over whether an act of rape or spouse
abuse is committed is not easily determined. “Women are more
likely to put labels on [rape and sexual harassment] than men,”

Rape is only considered rape by most people when “it occurs
at night and happens between strangers," said Ryan. Ryan

Students lz'p—syncf0r African room

By Jacinta Marie Dvorak
Staff Writer

Raising money and having fun
were the reasons behind the fifth
annual lip-sync contest that was
held on Thursday in the William
Pitt Union. The event was
sponsored by the Delta Sigma
Theta Sorority, Incorporated.

“This is a popular event and
people look forward to it every
year," said Angela Peterson,
sorority president. The money
that was raised at the contest will
beneﬁt the African Heritage
Nationalityclassroom scholarship
fund.

Nancy Lee, who helped to
organize the African Heritage
Classroom, was honored.
Peterson presented the sorority
alumnus with ﬂowers. Even
though the classroom was

completed in December, funds
are still needed in order to provide
scholarships for students who
want to study abroad. The sorority
hopes to have a scholarship
awarded annually to a junior who
wishes to study abroad for five
weeks in the summer.

The contest consisted of nine
acts. “We’ve had registration since
January,” Peterson said. “We really
didn’t have any last—minute acts
this year.”

The winners of the contest were
Tiffany Ellis and Doug Pampin,
who performed to the song, “I
Do.” The duo was awarded the
frrst—place prize of $100. The
second-place award of $50 went
to a group that performed to the
song, “Buddy.”

Judges for the event were
employees from various offices
around the university. One of the

judges, Charles Grier, community-
relations sergeant from the
department of public safety, said,
“It’s my first year judging. There
is a real tradition of step shows
connected with this sorority. I'm
honored to be one of the judges.”

Recently the sorority did a
service project at the Western
Pennsylvania School for the Blind.
“The students are here from the
school,” said Peterson. “They are
our special guests.” Eleven
students from the school attended
the competition.

“It’s good to see Delta Sigma
Theta incorporate so many
talented people under one roof.
It’s good to see so many people
support them, “ said Troy Bryant,
an audience member. Another
viewer, Kimberly Lee, said, “It’s
good to see entertainment like
this on campus.”

Blacks '

political

roles
discussed

By Joseph Bruce
For The Pitt News

While Black History Month has
recounted the historical roles of
many black Americans,
Representative Carl B. Stokes (D-
Ohio) took his time in the
spotlight a step further by
discussing the role of the young,
black American at the William
Pitt Union on Saturday night.

Stokes’ discussion centered
around the fact that the black
man can obtain any position he
wants if he believes and works
from within the system. He
pointed to the fact that Jesse
Jackson’s bid for the Democratic
Party’s presidential nomination
came down to a race between
him and one other person,
Michael Dukakis.

When asked about the people
who criticize Jackson for never
holding an elected office before
running for president, he said,
“Only white racists say that.
[Ronald] Reagan spent two years
as governor [of California], and
the next eight [years] ruining the
United States. Not serving doesn't
make a difference to be an
executive.”

Stokes does not believe that

Jackson will run for mayor of is

Washington, D.C. “Jessie won’t
run for mayor; it’s too limiting an
enterprise,” he said. What makes
Jad-(son so important, Stokes said,
is the fact that he came close to
the presidency, that he challenged
the establishment . successfully,
and that he gained considerable
ground in 1988. Jackson has

Pitt signs exchange agreement Stokes

By Jeﬂ’ Tatusko
Staff Writer

The University of Pittsburgh
has signed an unprecedented
agreement with West Germany's
University of Konstanz in the
area of scientiﬁc philosophy.

This collaboration, which was
signed onjan. 16, will allow both
universities to make their
combined resources available to
scholars on both sides of the
ocean.

’ “This agreementwill strengthen
lPitt’sl library resources and make
it very attractive for [people to do
researchl,” said Dr.
Rescher,_ a Pitt philosophy
professor.

According to Rescher, scientiﬁc
philosophy is “an approach to
traditional philosophical
problems in light of both scientific
results and scientiﬁc methods.” It
gained popularity in both
Germany and Austria in the 1920s
and 303, until it was driven out
by the Nazis.

In the early 1970s, Pitt received

Nicholas .

several major collections of
writings in scientiﬁc philosophy
from Rudolf Carnap and Hans
Reichenbach, two important
ﬁgures in this ﬁeld. Along with
these came papers from Frank
Ramsey, another big contributor
to this area of study.

Last year, an agreement with
the University of Minnesota
resulted in the writings of Herbert
Feigl being given to Pitt. The
writings by a key ﬁgure in logical
empiricisrn, a school of scientiﬁc
philosophy, have made Pitt a
world leader in this area.

The university now has one of
the largest collections of
philosophical documents in the
world With the treaty, Pitt will
send many of the documents in
its philosophy of science
collection over to the University
of Konstanz. Many of these
documents, originally from
Germany, will now be returned.

Dr. Gerald Massey, director for
Pitt's center for philosophy of
science, was the originator of the
agreement He said that one of

the major components of the
treaty is a biannual meeting
between the two universities.

“Both universities will meet
every other year for discussions
on the archives,” Massey said.
“They will start next year in West
Germany, and in 1993 we will
meet here in Pittsburgh.”

Massey described the
University of Konstanz as “a new
and good West German
university, especially in
philosophy.”

Massey said that, in addition to
exchanging information and
holding joint conferences, both
sides will now be able to
exchange graduate students to
further study each other’s
archives.

Rescher sees a trend in
agreements with the West
Germans. “The Germans are
more affluent than most

_European countries, and they

are developing into a major
superpower, like the. Japanese.
lt’s good that we are developing
better relations with them.”

“After one Visit to The South Side Hospital,
I was convinced I should begin my nursing
career there. And I was right. ”/czhris Rhoades, mi.

The South Side Hospital is a true community hospital-located only
a few minutes from Oakland and downtown Pittsburgh—offering
challenges and opportunities to learn. A close-knit atmosphere '
provides support, and nurses are treated as professionals. Working
here can help you to develop more conﬁdence in your abilities.

The South Side Hospital oﬂers competitive salaries and beneﬁts, as
well as some beneﬁts you won’t ﬁnd at other hospitals in the city.
Like FREE on-site parking adjacent to the hospital and a day care
center right- at the hospital.‘ A scholarship program can pay for your
last term of school, and you can work here as a nurse extem even
before you graduate. A 100% tuition reimbursement program can
help you complete or further your education.

Located on Mary Street, near the heart of

revitalized East Carson Street, The South Side
Hospital is convenient to the entire Pittsburgh

metropolitan area.

For more information and a tour of the beautiful new South Side
Hospital facilities, call Lucretia Anderson, Fl.N., M.N., Director of
Nursing, collect at (41 2) 488-5900.

paved the way for others by
proving that the system works
and that the increasing elasticity
of this government in which we
live in is expanding, Stokes added.

Stokes hopes his career in
politics will pave the way for
other blacks to follow. He said, ‘‘I
hope it gives conﬁdence to young,
black Americans; hope that the
system is elastic enough for them
to do anything they want to.”

Stokes also commented on ,

current President George Bush
and his choice of Dan Quayle as
his running mate. Stokes said it
was a sad state of affairs that
Bush chose to “look for someone
without substance; someone who
wouldn’t challenge Bush.”

One of his main concerns was

« 5430 CENTRE AVENUE

the fact that the judges Bush has
nominated on the appellate level
are as conservative as those
nominated by Reagan. This, along
with the policy of no new money
for the drug war and the reduction
of money to an already
underfunded housing, has Stokes
concerned.

“Bush has made a mockery of

being the education president. I

refers to this kind of rape as “blitz
rape.” She said it is harder for
people to accept date rape or
rape between a married couple
as actual rape.

Spouse abuse is very difficult
to define, according to Ryan.
People are hesitant to deﬁne
verbal and emotional aggression
as a form of spouse abuse. Ryan
said spouse abuse is defined by
today’s culture as theabuse of the
wife; male aggression is seen as
immoral. In contrast, female
aggression is often found as
acceptable behavior.

Sexual harassment is defined
differently by each institution,
making it difficult to distinguish
when it has been committed,
according to Ryan. There are three
levels of sexual harassment:
physical harassment, offensive
verbal accusations and ﬂirtation.

“In most cases, the female’s
behavior was looked at as less
important,” said Ryan.

M U niversity of

Irene Frieze, Ph.D., of the
Pittsburgh
department of psychology, talked
of what goes on in the mind of
the victim and the reactions of
people towards the victim.

Frieze said that most people
believe that “bad things happen
to bad people in a just world,’’’
and that most people are
unsympathetic toward the victim.

After becoming the victim of a
violent act such as rape, a person
goes through a process of
restoring their world view. The
victim may deny that anything
really happened, according to
Frieze. The victim may also
redefine the event, saying things
like, “It really wasn’t rape,” and
may trivialize the event by arguing
that it wasn’t important. The
public reinforces this view by
blaming the victim.

Frieze said that one of the most
common myths relating to violent
acts against women is that the
woman provoked it, or she liked

it and allowed herself to be a
victim. A common myth about
the assailant is “he was overcome
with sexual feelings at the time
and could not help himself,” or,
“he comes from a poor,
disadvantaged background and
he should be pitied,” said Frieze.

Victims of hate crimes suffer
many emotional symptoms such
as shock, anger, fear, depression
and helplessness. These
symptoms could last as long as
seven years. The sources of these
symptoms are self-blame and the
feeling of the loss of safety.

One way of coping with this
stress is by seeking help. “A victim
might use self-blame to help cope
with stress by seeing themselves
as the type of person this happens
to,” said Frieze. A

president of the Federal Executive
Council for Finance, thinks this
was the best route.

“We had to reduce or make
these changes first before we
could do anything with the
inﬂation," he said. “Yes, I think
we did the right thing.”

These new changes have
drastically reduced Yugos1avia’s
inﬂation rate, having gone from
1,500 percent last year to about
.10 percent today. Prego also
predicted that it could go even
lower.

“After we implemented the anti—
inﬂation policy [in December],
our inﬂation rate dropped to 70
percent. It was at 17 percent in
January, and it’s at 10 percent this
month,” he said. “Our experts say

that next month it could drop to
7 percent and maybe lower.”
Their government still faces the
problem of the many provinces
and republics. “Our country can’t
do anything without the general
consensus of these republics,” he
said. “We also can’t punish them

for not agreeing with us. T hat,
wouldn’t be good for all of

Yugoslavia.”

Though Prego’s speech dealt
mainly with economics, he also
talked about politics in his

country. “Political democracy? is“

good for Yugoslavia,” he said,
“but we will not I, have
compromises, . only essential
changes.”

with that.

“With free elections, many
political parties will get
organized," he said. “This will
take some time. Also, the
provinces and republics will be

these elections would come no
later than October.

Coyne discussed the Hate
Crimes Statistics Act, which was
recently passed by the U.S. Senate
and will be voted on by the
House of Representatives soon.
The act will make the justice
department keep statistics on all
hate crimes throughout the nation.

“We should be collecting
credible data on hate crimes, and
we are not now doing it," Coyne
said. “It would take you just a few
phone calls to find out how many
Americans are victims of burglary
or assault.”

Coyne noted that the
establishment of a center for
statistics alone will not be enough
to bring change, but said that the

data can be used by law-
enforcement agencies throughout
the country. .

“It’s not going to be an instant
cure-all, but it will be a vehicle
that will allow enforcement to be
easier,” he said. “Statistics can
have political meaning in our
society, and we’re fortunate for
that.”

The act will also give the U.S.
attorney general the power to
decide if other segments of the

population are becoming victims ‘

of hate crimes and to start keeping
statistics on these groups. Coyne
said that if the act is passed, he
will ask Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh to start collecting data
on crimes against the homeless,
citing New York City bag ladies
being burned to death as an
indication of the necessity -to
protect the poor.

Coyne also said that he is
confident the bill will be passed
by the House when it is voted on.
In passing the bill, the Senate
defeated all of the amendments
that conservative Senator Jesse
Helms (R-NC) tacked onto it.

The local officials agreed,

t however, that laws against hate

crimes are not enough to defeat
them and that education is

necessary to eliminate bigotry.

“I want to caution you,” Cohen
said. “Laws on the books are nice
to have, but they don’t get to the
underlying cause. What we really
need to combat hate crimes is
community action.”

He added that, according to
the Anti—defamation League of
B’nai B’rith, 40 percent of all
hate—crime victims were so
humiliated that they never
discussed the crime with anyone.

“We need neighborhood-based
programs to counsel victims of
hate crimes. We need programs
to assist them in court and assist
them psychologically if
necessary,” he said.

Cohen also said that the
criminals need help as well. “The
underlying cause of hate crimes
is ignorance. Over half of the
people who perpetrate hate
crimes are juveniles. I think that
we have to realize that until we
help people [overcome] their
ignorance, we are not going to
stop hate crimes.”

George Simmons of the
Pittsburgh office of the
Pennsylvania Human Relations
Committee also spoke on the
importance of education.

Status coupfor Cory Aquino,
Sterilized  mind in W. Virginia

The militarily strategic advantage of the Philippines has
always been vital to U.S. interests. The island contains the
two largest overseas American military installations: the
Subic Bay Naval Base and Clark Air Force Base.

The U.S. military bases are also vital to the domestic
stability of the Philippines. Military protection and secu-
rity aside, the U.S. bases employ nearly 80,000 Filipinos,
making them the second-largest employer in the Philip-
pines and add nearly $1 million per day to the Philippine
economy. Out of the nearly $600 million that goes to East

a Asia annually, about $500 million goes to the Philippines.

They are the fifth-highest recipient of U.S. foreign aid.
Although members of the communist insurgency — the
group that has attempted a half-dozen military coups of

Philippine President Corazon Aquino in recent years ———l

are for obvious reasons against the presence of the US.
troops,» Aquino and top government members have sup-
ported" the presence of U.S. troops to deter and quell

insurgency uprisings. Their support was rewarded and«

evident when Bush authorized U.S. aircraft to play a
critical role in thwarting the most recent coup attempt.

T  However, in a stunning sign of protest, Aquino refused
to meet U.S. Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney during his
trip to the Philippines last week because of proposed U.S.
cuts in aid to the Philippines. The cuts are justified in that
the U.S. wants to allocate the aid to countries which need
it more, such as Panamaand Eastern Europe.

In doing this, Aquino has proven her incompetence by
threatening internal Philippine stability and security by
pulling off perhaps the most idiotic move in the history of
U.S.-Philippine diplomacy. The U.S. presence and back-
ing of Aquino has spurned many violent insurgency
attempts. However, this message of no-confidence sent
by Aquino to the U.S. invites and gives the greenlight to
the insurgency to go ahead and attempt another coup.
After all, Cheney and the Bush administration would be
extremely patient and forgiving if they condoned Aquino’s
very rude actions and helped her in the next coup
attempt. They would be justified if they didn’t.

In the past two years, Philippine Communist insurgen-
cies have murdered six Americans affiliated with the U.-S.
military. Leftist students quickly capitalized on Aquino’s
unknowing capitulation with violent, protests last Mon-
day; they called Cheney a “war monger” and “white
monkey” and demanded the removal of U.S. troops. A

I usually cool Cheney left his visit infuriated. Secretary of

State James Baker hinted that the U.S. may remove the
bases if such actions continue. _

By acting like a spoiled big sister whose daddy had just
cut her allowance in order to spread some of it to her
needy, growing little brothers, Aquino has opened the
doors of her quarters for a coup d’etat. And this time, due
to a possible lack of support by the United States, Cory

QW ’

I had genuinely intended to
take a sabbatical leave from The
Pitt News perspective page. I had
worked out a deal with Paul
Kengor, my editor, that would
allow me to take a month off, yet
still receive my three-ﬁgure pay-
check. The fates are cruel.

It was a drizzling Sunday night

‘when Kengor burst into. my of-
fice. He wanted to know if I’d
come back “for just one more
column.” I felt like the CIA spook,
begging to retire, who keeps being
called back for one more assign-
ment. I would have said no but
Kengor reminded me that he still
has those snapshots of Nancy
Reagan and me at Blue Swan
Lake. “Zounds! I’ll do it,” I mut-
tered through my clenched teeth,
spitting out my ﬁfth straight piece
of Wrigley’s Doublemint gum. I
was gonna kick the habit last
week too.

The case I decided on was as
queer as an evening at Liberty
Avenue’s Pegasus Lounge, or so
l’ve heard. It involves a bill that
was actually proposed to West
Virginia’s Senate last week. In
Charleston, Senator Charlotte Pritt,
a Democrat and teacher, pro-
posed a bill that calls for the
“sterilization of a person who
falls a year behind in child—sup-
port payments.” Yes, that's right
— this woman actually wants
surgery performed on someone
who neglected to send money.

ju st last month there was some
brouhaha ﬂoating about concern-

ing castration for rapists. Although
I’m against this punishment (it's
not severe enough) I at least
understand why some angry and
frustrated citizens would suggest
it. But this woman, Pritt, who is
calling for sterilization, has got to
be the biggest wackadoo to come
along since Boy George.

I

    

Mari
Oliverio

Pritt’s argument is that if a
person cannot be ﬁnancially
responsible for the children they
already have, then they should
not be privileged to contribute”
more offspring to the population.
Excuse me while I stop for a
second and bang my head on this
computer monitor 

I’m back and still can't believe
this woman. The interesting thing
about the bill she is proposing is
that the bill says “any person,”
and not just “any man.” What a
modern gal this Pritt person is.
Sherealizes that in today’s soci-
ety there is a likely chance that a
woman may also be paying child

support I would now like to ‘

address my female readers and
ask you to ponder what it would
be like to have your capacity to
reproduce either sucked or
snipped, , or rented from your
body. Suddenly radical feminism
isn't very chic.

Another astounding feature
about Pritt is that she's pro-abor-
tion. That amazed me because
many pro—abortion women claim

that no one should take away A
their reproductive rights, yet this at

is exactly what Pritt’s bill would
do, permanently. Can anybody
else find the hypocrisy in her

views or does one have to be on ‘j

the radical right to be observant?
Scarier yet, if her bill becomes
a law, it could open up a Pan-

dora’s Box of punishments ex- 

ceeding the crime. A few sugges-
tions -— if someone racks up
over $300 in speeding and park-
ing tickets then their “accelerator
foot” must be amputated since
they are not responsible drivers.
Anyone under 21 caught drink-
ing must have their liver removed
to teach them a-valuable lesson.

And of course, anyone trying to V

go through the express lane in a
super-market with (gasp!) 13
‘items or more must be forced to
bag their own groceries.

1984 was six years ago and Big _

Brother never emerged. But with
people like Charlotte Pritt sniff-
ing around the legislative branch,
maybe we should start worrying
about Big Sister.

Listen geek, I mean, Chip, you’re
measuring way off the sphinc-
tometer. You sound like you have
a promising career ahead of you.
Stick with the computer stuff.
You won’t disappoint your dad,

and just think how much
money you can make break-
ing into your bank's computer
system. Or think of the na-
tional attention you could get
by throwing a virus into the

Don’t give up so easy; there is
still a lot of enjoyment to be
had in the computer-science
ﬁeld. Besides, philosophy is '
hard. Your problem with
women is going to demand a

there, and maybe try photog-
raphy, it’s a good hobby for

Pitt bumps Boston College, 81-73, for fifst road Victory

By Scot Ross
Managing Editor

CHESTNUT HILL, MA -—— A story can have all the elements of
suspense, inspiration and confrontation in the world and still not
create any emotion in the reader. Ask the 5,183 people who braved
the north wind to see Pitt better the Boston College Eagles at the
Conte Forum for their first Big East road win of the season, 81-73.

Given the late season and the small prospect of a tournament
invitation for either team, one may have been hard-pressed to clip a
bevy of exciting excerpts from the game. But consider:

-The tension appeared high on the BC bench early, everyone held

~ was in suspense wondering whether or not Lior Arditti, starting guard,
would return after twisting his ankle while shufﬂing off a pass
following the opening tip. He did return 11 minutes later, although
this merited about as much reaction from the crowd as the “Win Back
Your Tuition” sign from the Massachusetts lottery next to the
scoreboard. A

-There was the inspirational play of freshman center David Hinton,
who grabbed a page from Rocky “Cut me, Mick” Balboa and played
most of the game with a huge wad of Kleenex stuffed up his nose to
stop the blood flow from the shot in the nose he took midway through
the first half. ‘ I

-And what about Panther Rod Brookin’s diplomacy in quieting an
otherwise-unruly spectator? A short-lived conﬂict, but appropriate
action and well-executed nonetheless. A .

Doug Able, BC’s starting forward, described the results matter—of-
factly. “The overall atmosphere wasn’t there. If we’d wanted a little
more [they would have won]. They really didn’t want to win.”

In the ﬁrst half, Pitt secured a lead, but its inability to capitalize on
BC’s mistakes was the difference between a Walkaway and the
moderately close game that resulted. Boston put the ball in Pitt’s
hands, but Pitt wasn’t able to put the ball into the basket.

Early in the half Pat Cavanaugh, who started at guard as Pitt went
to a three— guard set, had two steals off inbound passes in the
Panthers’ end. The ﬁrst was dished to Bobby Martin under the basket,
who was fouled on the play and unable to come up with the shot.
The second, he dumped to Darren Morningstar in the same place,
who tossed it up twice before Brookin grabbed the rebound and put
in the shot, giving Pitt a 17-12 lead.

Cavanaugh also threw in two three-pointers and tallied eight points
in a rare start. He credited the success of Pitt press and the defense.
“We concentrated on playing tough. If you concentrate on defense,
that will keep you up.”

Brian Shorter spoke of Pitt’s new formation and the game plan. “We
just said to get the ball inside as much as possible. We tend to lose
concentration sometimes. We need to keep the same attitude [and]
try to keep on winning because the season’s almost over."

Shorter (22 points, 6 rebounds) came to life late in the ﬁrst half,
knocking in 10 points in the last 2:23 as Pitt led 37-28.

After inching their way back to within four behind Hinton’s 18
points, Brookin took the game into his own hands with four minutes
left, popping an 18-foot jump shot and then going to the hoop and

“Women's hoop team drops heartbreaker to Connecticut

By Sean Hellman
Staff Writer

If Saturday is any indication of
what may happen in the next few
weeks in Big East women's
basketball, March Madness will
not be limited to the men.

The Lady Panthers erased an
eight-point deﬁcit to tie the game
with no time left in regulation
against 25th-ranked Connecticut,
but lost in overtime 82-80 in an
emotional game at Fitzgerald Field
House.

The loss dropped Pitt to 13-13
and 5-10 in the conference.
Connecticut is now 22-4, 13-2.

The LadyPanthers were seeking
the home upset from the start.
Pitt co-captain Lorri Johnson was
the team's inspirational leader on
the court, sparking her teammates
and the crowd with a visible

, show of emotion. She eventually

fouled out with 2:07 left in the

second half and Pitt down by
two, but that did not keep her
from contributing verbal support
from the bench.

Johnson ﬁnished the game with
a team lead of 25 points and ﬁve
steals.

WithJohnson on the bench the
rest of the team had to ﬁnish the
job against the powerful Lady
Huskies and almost did it.

“Our plan was to go out there
and play our hearts. out,” said Pitt
Coach Kirk Bruce. “We didn’t
know whether or not anything
we did was going to work."

“I thought everybody gave it
their all," said freshman forward
T uria Ransom who ﬁnished with
14 points and seven rebounds.

Pitt had a chance to win in
regulation. With 13 seconds left
and Connecticut leading 74-75,

Lady Huskie Debbie Baer missed
the front end of a one—and-one.
Pitt's Jennifer Shingler rebounded
and the Lady Panthers called a
timeout with eight seconds left to
discuss the play for the game-
winning basket.

Ransom inbounded the ball to
Maureen McConnell who passed
to freshman Lisa Fessler for a
three-point attempt. Her shot
bounded off the rim toward
Shingler, who was covered by
Connecticut’s Meghan Pattyson.

As time expired, Pattyson was
called for a foul, sending Shingler
to the line for a one-and-one.

Shingler made the first shot,
tying the game, but missed the
second, sending the game into
overtime.

Bruce said the play before the
foul went as planned. He wanted

Fessler to shoot from the outside
for the win.

“Lisa's the kind of girl [that] if
she gets her hands on the ball
and gets a good shot off, she's
going to make the majority of
them,” said Bruce.

Auriemma was so upset with
the foul being called, he
demonstrated his knowledge of
the game of basketball.

“It might have been one of the
worst calls in the history of
basketball.” I

In overtime, Pitt had a similar
chance to tie or win. Connecticut’s
Kerry Bascom, the pre-season
Big East Player of the Year, missed
a free throw with 14 seconds left
and a 82-80 Connecticut lead. Pitt
called another timeout to set up
the play.

Bruce called for the same play

as in regulation, an outside jumper
from Fessler. But she was covered
too well and the ball ended up in
McConnell’s hands. She took a
long three-point shot that hit the
front of the rim.

“Everybody gave it their all,”
said Ransom “Everything seemed
to be working for us. But we just
fell short.”

Lady Panther Notes: Pitt can
no longer catch Syracuse for ﬁfth
place in the conference. Pitt plays
Villanova (1-14) tonight at 7:30 at
Fitzgerald Field House. If the
Lady Panthers ﬁnish sixth it would
mean a probable game against
third-place Seton Hall in the ﬁrst
round of the Big East tournament
in Connecticut. Pitt center Connie
Hurt had two blocked shots giving
her 34 in conference play, which
sets a new Big East season record.

Depth plays key role
in Lady Panthers win

Along with their streak, the
Lady Panthers rewrote both their
school and personal record
books.

The Lady Panthers began their
rewrite when Kristen Brown, an
all-around competitor, scored a
9.65 on the balance beam to
break Gina Venezia’s record of
9.55 set during last month's meet
at Ohio State. Brown also broke
her personal all—around record as
well as this season’s all-around
record by scoring a 36.90.

“[It was] awesome, but I didn’t
think that it was that good of a
routine. I didn't think it was a
9.65, but if they'll give it to me, I’ll
take it," said Brown.

Following up Brown's beam
performance, Venezia tied the
score of her recently broken beam
record.

“(My routine] could have been
a better routine, I lost like two-
tenths on my leap,‘ but I was
happy,” .. said Venezia. “Records
were meant to be broken so [the
beam record is] going to be

' broken again. I’m sure I’m going

to get like a 9.7 or a 9.8 by the end
of the season.’ .

The last of the personal records
for the Lady Panthers was that of
Kathy Wallish, who was
competing as an all-around
competitor when she received a
score of 56.65. 0

“It was my highest performance
ever,” said Wallish, “I had my
highest all—around and I moved
up two half-tenths from mylast
all—around.”

The Lady Panthers will be
traveling to Maryland on Saturday,
March 10, to compete with both
the Towson State University Lady
Tigers and the Rutgers University
Lady Scarlet Raiders. The meet is

‘scheduled for 2 pm. at T owson

Center.

getting fouled on the play. He
converted the three—point play
and from there Boston College

, could do nothing more than keep

fouling Pitt en route to the loss.

Brookin said, “It felt good to
get the win on the road.” He
added that the pressure situation
best suits him. “[During] my four
years here I was always for
helping the team as bestl [could].

I haven’t been shooting well the 1

past two or three games. It was a
big lift for [me]."

Pitt’s will meet St. John's tonight
at 7:30 in the Civic Arena. If he
scores nine points, Jason
Matthews will pass Jerome Lane
as eighth on Pitt’s all-time scoring

= list. His 16 points put him past

Curtis Aiken (1,217).-
