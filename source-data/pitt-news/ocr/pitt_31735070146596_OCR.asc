Cultural Gallery Crawl

]ohn:Manganaro
Assistant News Editor

To its organizers, this Friday’s Cultural
District Gallery Crawl will not be an A-to-B
kind of affair.

“In the process of moving. from A to B
you’ll inevitably run into something new,”
said Veronica Corpuz, director of public
relations for the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust.
“Much of the Cultural District is based on
ﬁnding that educational or engaging per-
formance. It’s different from just catching a
movie. Entertainment is a good by-product,
but we’re trying to build an appreciation
for Pittsburgh’s art and artists.”

It is that educational attitude that at-
tracted many of the galleries and stages
participating in this year’s crawl, which
starts at 5:30 p.m. and hits locations
throughout the Cultural District. The Wood
Street’Galleries, one of the ﬁrst stops in
the crawl, is using the event to open a new
exhibit called Outer’ Body/Inner Experi-
ences.

“The exhibit invites viewer participa-
tion in an outer—body experience,” said
Kate Little, curatorial assistant at Wood
Street Galleries.

Located near the Wood Street T station,
the gallery currently holds art by Airan
Kang, Matt Stokes, Lawrence Malstaff, Luc
Courchesne and Jim Campbell.

“We definitely use crawls like this to
attract new viewers not only to our gallery
but to the city itself,” Little said. “Most
people see town as a 9-to-5 kind of place.
They work here and then they go home.
But we host events like this so that people
will come back.”

Little believes the gallery crawl, the
“crown jewel” of the Pittsburgh Cultural
Trust Education Department, is one of
the few programs in the city that is fully
focused on art education.

“I know there are some weird cell phone
art tours, where you get text messages
about the different galleries, but other

than that this is an area where Pittsburgh

could use some improvement,” Little said.
“You can’t learn about art from your cell
phone.” E » l .

With a range of new venues added this
year, Friday’s crawl will be one of the larg-
est of the year. .The evening begins at the
_]azzLive Summer Stage at the corner of
Seventh Avenue and Fort Duquesne Boule-
vard and an outdoor block party on Ninth
and Penn avenues.

At the block party, DJ Mike Canton of
WYEP and DJ Nate “da Phat” Barber will
spin “early soul” and hip-hop music. Al 10-
cal break dance crew, The Get Down Gang, .
will also perform. L L

Corpuz said the block party is going to
be among the most exciting stops on the
crawl and that anyone planning to attend
the event should arrive no later than 7:25
p.m. .
“There may just be a big surprise at the .
end of the block party. It’s going to end in
a ﬂash,” Corpuz said. “You don’t want to
miss it.”

Another new feature of this year’s gal-
lery crawl will be a performance by “indie/
soul royalty Eric Roberson.” Corpuz said
the gallery crawl show will be the ﬁrst time
Roberson and his band have traveled to
Pittsburgh. ' A

“We’re very excited to have landed Eric
for this crawl,” Corpuz said. “We’re psyched
to have him grace the ]azzLive stage.”

Roberson will have some competition
for best band in the crawl in Pittsburgh
native and rising jazz star Chelsea Baratz.
Based in NYC, Baratz has played with -the
likes of Christian McBride, the Roots,
Soulive, Dirty Dozen Brass Band and DJ
Logic. '. -

“Our crawl has been growing over the
past several years, and by this point we’ve
been able to get really the best of the best,”
Corpuz said. “The ultimate goal is to pro-
vide a high—quality, artful experience for
both newcomers and veteran crawlers
alike.”

A complete list and map of events can
be found at the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust’s

Senior Stajf Writer

It wasn’t an ordinary Sunday picnic. A group
of about 15 Pitt students feasted on sushi,
tempura, grilled zucchini, tacos, salad,
brownies and berry pie on Flagstaff Hill.
The students didn’t just cook the food, they
harvested many of the ingredients from a
plot on Oakland Avenue. .

“It’s just really moving for me to see not
only them harvest this stuff, but it turn into '
something,” said President of Plant to Plate
Reva Gorelick. “We’re not just picking up
pizza from around the corner.”

Pitt’s Plant to Plate student organization
teaches students about sustainable agri-
culture and connects themto their food
through urban gardening. The Sundaypicnic
was the celebration of the group’s ﬁrst har-

vest of zucchini, cucumbers," tomatoes, hot
peppers, purple basil, green beans, purple
beans and strawberries.

The group’s progress on the Oakland Av-
enue plot shows how the urban gardening
movement is gaining visibility in Oakland.

“we’ve got corn high as an elephant’s
eye,” declared Marc Schutzbank, a Pitt alum-
nus who volunteers with the organization.

Gorelick put her own measure in, as well,
sayingcorn that is “knee—high by the Fourth
of July” is making good progress. Though
impressed by the corn, she squealed with
glee over the zucchinis.

“I’ve been watching them grow since they
were baby baby, the size of my thumb, and
now they’re as big as baseball bats,” she
said. V l _ _

Group members take daily shifts to water
and weed the gardens.*They measure the
plants’ growth and keep track of the data.

Giant slugs slime Oakland, captivate locals

Estelle Tran
Senior Staff Writer

They’ve appeared in Oakland for
about four years, living as if they’ve
never lived before — a hedonistic
lifestyle. On cool summer nights,
they can be found hanging out on
porches or cruising the streets.
They dwell in old, cracked build-
ings and don’t mind clutter. When
it comes to food, they’re not picky.
And with beer, they’ll have whatev-
er someone is willing to buy them.
The bittersweet indulgence’ can be
a costly one because if they have
too much  plop. They’ll drown.
It’s hard not to consider a Limax
maximus one of the guys or gals
—— or both. The Limax maximus,
meaning “g_re__a’t-slVL1' "’ is_.t_he larg-
est know ”  inLPenhsylvania.
They lovellivingvinivcitiés and can
be found‘ all [over Oakla-nd. They
can grow up to about 6 inches long
and are known for their leopard-
like spots on their grayish-brown
skin. The leopard print gives the
Limax maximus its common name,

 

 

-“leopard s1ug.”

Tim Pearce, head of the Section
of Mollusks at the Carnegie Mu-
seum of Natural History, believes
there are more slugs this year be-
cause of the heavy snow this past
winter.

“Most of the mollusks in our
area have antifreeze, so they can
stand temperatures well below
freezing and still be alive. They
would crawl underneath the
ground where it stays warmer.
When we have snow like we did
this past winter, that snow acts like
a really nice blanket,” Pearce said.
“I personally have more slugs in my
garden this year.”

Leopard slugs start becoming

visible in May and stay out until
the fall. These slugs like to hide
in cracks in houses and sidewalks
when it’s too hot an’d dangerous
for them to be outside. ,

“Slugs are like leaky bags of wa-
ter trying to survive on dry land,”
Pearce said. . .‘

Leopard slugs are "found in
many states, but they’re.mostly
in port cities and states along the
east coast.

Movies andmore in    
Pittsburgh’s parks

John Manganaro
Assistant News Editor

Joe Dewitt watcheda mass of clouds loom
over the Cathedral of Learning, slowly roll-
ing toward Schenley Park. Behind him stood
Flagstaff Hill and about 200 Pittsburghers,
looking anxious on their blankets and fold-
ing chairs. ’

V Dewitt, a recreation assistant with Citi-
parks, is part of the crew that puts on Cinema
in the Parks, a ﬁlm screening series bring-
ing titles like “The Blind Side” and “Up” to
greenspaces across Pittsburgh. Dewitt and
the cinema team show movies every night of
the week, erecting a projection screen and

. sound system _at each location.

“It doesn’t look good,” Dewitt said,
watching the clouds. “This is expensive
equipment, and that looks like a lot of
rain.” _

V Five minutes later the sky opened up,
forcing the Citiparks crew to postpone the
screening. But while Mother Nature won the
battle that rainy Sunday injune, Dewitt and
the rest of Citiparks are well on their way to
winning the war to provide unique summer
entertainment.

Every day of the week, Citiparks provides
myriad opportunities to enjoy the warm
days of summer. Dewitt says he loves his
job, and asa junior Point Park. University

cinema student, he thinks the experience '.

will look good on a resume.

“The real name for my job should be
‘grunt,’ _but it’s good work,” Dewitt joked
one June evening while erecting the massive
screen on Flagstaff Hill; “They’ve assembled
the team of world’s strongest men, and I’m
one of them.” ' ' V

De_witt’s,humor is matched by the rest
of the Cinemain the Parks crew and many
others who work for Citiparks. His supervi-
sor, Chris Bascher, is a Point‘Park graduate

.and a former cinema student. The crew’s _

expertise is apparent, and it takes them less
than a half hour to set up a fully functioning
outdoor theater system.

“We like to have fun while we work, but
that comes with the territory,” Bascher said.
“Pittsburghers really seem to enjoy the free
shows, and we enjoy bringing the entertain-
ment to them. Plus we get to work outside
and move all around the city.”

The Cinema‘ in the Parks program con-
tinues through August and represents one
of Citipark’s most popular programs. Like

. many of Cit_ipark’s programs, Cinema in the

Parks is presented with the help of local
businesses. L -

This summer the entire Citiparks team
has established more than 30 programs and
events in the region. Many of them, like the
weekly classical music show called “Bach,
Beethoven and Brunch,” run throughout the
summer and are focused on both entertain-
ment and education.

Brian Kratze, program coordinator for
the summer concert series, said the weekly
shows are not just for classical music buffs.

Many of the performers mix elements of pop _

and rock music into their performances, pro-
ducing Bach—and-Beethoven-inspired per-
formances thatexplore multiple genres.
“Wehad a group called Cello Fury bring
out a crowd of about 500 people,” Kratze
said. “They played a lot of modern music

-V on classic instruments; a few cellos with
a drummer. That’s what this program is‘

all about.” A .

So far this summer, the Bach, Beethoven
and Brunch program has featured a diverse
range of artists, from a three-man folk—pop
group to the almost—60—man Pittsburgh
Philharmonic Orchestra. The groups are
wired toga speaker system that encompasses
much of the park, allowing an even larger
audience to enjoy the music.

“We have a lot of people who don’t care
to see the stage, people who are just hang-
ing out in the park enjoying the music,”

Labor disputes continue at Pitt

Michael Macagnone
Assistant News Editor

The investigation into Sodexo’s em-
ployment practices on campus has
moved forward since the spring
protests at Market Central, while ne-
gotiations between the food service
provider and union representatives
continue. _ .

Whﬂe the issues are separate, both
the investigation and contract negotia-
tions can have an effect on workers at
Pitt and the way Pitt’s dining services
run.

The investigation, which began
in March, will likely ﬁnish inside the
next two weeks. SEIU charges kicked
off the inquiry, claiming that Sodexo
interrogated and intimidated its non-
unionized workers.

The SEIU, or Service Employees
International Union, represents more
than 2 million employees across North
America V

SEIU Local 32B] represents more V

than 5,000 workers inWestem Penn-
sylvania, according to its website. ,
The National Labor Relations
Board, a federal agency that investi-
gates allegations of unfair labor prac-

tices and holds elections to determine
if workers want to form a union, be-
ganthe investigation morethanthree
months ago.

Robert Chester, the regional direc-
tor of the National Labor Relations
Board, said that the group will likely
decide on the charges inthe nextweek
to 10 days.

“Sodexo is cooperating fully in
the NLRB’s ongoing investigations
at the University of Pittsburgh,” said

— Monica Zirnmer, the spokeswoman

for Sodexo.

In May, Chester said that the
process would likely take six to eight
weeks. The investigation has now
“taken longer than normal,” he said.

Part of that delay came from a se-
ries of subpeonas that the NLRB sent;
to Sodexo, for both documents and
individuals. While the investigation
mighthave taken longerthan Chester
originally thought, a four-month in-
vestigation is not out of the ordinary.

The results of this most recent
Sodexo investigation could be any-
thing ﬁ'om dropped charges, an out-
of-court settlement or a trial Chester
said thatfewerthans percent of cases
go to court.

The negotiations between the

union and Sodexo have gone on
since February, before an extension
on the workers’ old contract ended.
The workers at Pitt have been working
under the terms of their old, expired
contract since it ended in March.

When negotiations stalled at the
end of April —- during ﬁnals week
at Pitt — the union laimched a vocal
three—day strike on Pitt’s campus.

That was the ﬁrst time food ser-
vice workers at Pitt had struck since
1970. -

Afterthe strike ended, negotiations
continued with a federal mediator,
and all communications between the
two parties goes through the media-
tor. Both sides have been optimistic
aboutthe outcomeforthepastseveral
months.

sylvaniadirectorofthe SEIU, setagoal

Scientists get slimy

Slugs 4 3

Pearce said most garden slugs, like the
leopard slug, are invasive species from Eu-
rope. The leopard slug was ﬁrst discovered in
the United States about 150 years ago. Pearce
said they likely traveled to_North America
on merchant ships in the soil and rocks the

ships used as ballast. The merchants would
dump the dirt onto the North American soil, '

ﬁll their ships with goods and head back to
Europe. ‘ V '

Pearce and his friend Paul Robb, who is a
collections assistant at the Carnegie Museum
of Natural History, disagree about whether
the leopard slug is a pest.

“It’s been here a long time,” Robb said.
‘-‘As I like to say, I think it’s time it gets its
citizenship papers.”

Since the leopard slugs are city slugs, they
have little interaction with native slugs. But
Pearce believes these slugs are detrimental

to humans and the economy because they‘

eat cabbage, kale, bok choy, hostas and other

5 plants. .
‘ “I’m going to let the vegetable plants live,

and I’m killing the weeds. We do play God. We
do decide who lives and dies. I have chosen to
favor the native species in a land,” he said.
He continued to say that just because
there’s no evidence of the slug harming na-
tives doesn’t mean it’s not happening.
Pearce and Robb agree that the leopard
slugs are aggressive. ' _
Robb used to raise leopard slugs, and he
has seen their ferocity ﬁrst hand.
“There were numerous instances when‘I

saw the dominant slug just haul off and bite

its cagemates. I remember one instance. I
felt really sorry for this Limax maximus.
He was sitting out without a shell. I had an
overturned shell that provided shelter for
them. It was just sitting out. I felt so sorry
for him. I guess the other slugs had pushed
him out. This poor, forlorn slug crawled back
under the shell. Then, all of a sudden I saw
the other two leopard slugs that had been
under the shell bolt out in 90—degree direc-
tions from each other. And here this guy in
the overturned shell was biting the hell out

of them,” he said with a chuckle.

Robb has been bitten several times.‘
Though the slugs didn’t draw blood, the
nibble was startling. Slugs and snails have
hundreds, if not thousands, of tiny teeth
arranged in rows. They also have four ten-
tacles, two top tentacles with eyes on the
ends and two bottom ones for smelling and
tasting.

Pearce joked that maybe the slugs were
trying to mate with Robb’s ﬁnger.

Battle of the sexes — slug style

Though he’s never spotted a leopard slug,
CMU senior Evan Korol has seen a video
on YouTube of two leopard slugs mating. A
friend, who shared Korol’s interest in the

television series “Planet Earth?’ sent him a

the link. ,

“It’s* oneof those awkward things, but
it’s sort of beautiful,” Korol said.

Though leopard slugs are hermaphro-
dites, like most slugs, they still mate. Mating

for the leopard slug, however, is a particu-

larly taxing act. A BBC video narrated by
Sir David Attenborough explains that a slug
advertises its readiness to mate by changing

the taste of its slime. When a willing partner ‘ I

catches on, it will ﬁnd the other slug. They

travel up a tree, stair case or other structure

and twist their bodies together.

Then they slip down a thread of mucus.
While suspended in the air, the leopard slugs’
light blue male organs emerge from the right

side of their heads, and they intertwine. The —

male organs fan out, and spermpasses from
one slug to the other. .
Pearce has only seenthe leopard slug
mating spectacle once.
“I saw it when I- was in the ﬁfth grade,
way long ago, before I even knew what sex
was about. It was an amazing‘ thing, and so

it stuck with me,” he said.

Pearce believes that sperm passes both
ways when leopard slugs mate. They both
deposit sperm into the spermatheca, which
is a female reproductive organ and diges-

Students grow their own food on Oakland Avenue plot

Plant < 2

Jeff David, the group’s head farmer, said
it was gratifying to see most of the plants
start from seeds. Only the basil and about
20 tomato plants got a head start.

The Mascaro Center for Sustainable In-
novation gave the group $5,000 in seed
money to buy tools, soil and lumber to build
the raised bed frames and seeds. In the form
of a sustainability class, Pitt lent Plant to
Plate the lot for two years. P

Pitt spokesmanjohn Fedele said the Uni-

V versity has no plans for the area yet.

Plant to Plate is not alone in urban
gardening in Oakland, either. About one
block away from the Plant to Plate plot, Joe
Mamas grows herbs and tomatoes on the
restaurant’s roof. Joe Mamas’ chalkboard
advertisement beckons passersby to try the
summer sangria with mint from its rooftop
garden. ‘

“This was just wasted space other than
for holding the big, ugly air conditioner,”
general manager Deb Bankert said while
watering the plants on a Wednesday. morn-
ing.

She still remembers the excitement she
felt when the bartender asked her to go
to the roof to'snip some mint for the ﬁrst
mojito of the summer. Some people don’t

believe thatjoe Mamas uses fresh herbs in
its summer items, Bankert said, so she in-
vites nonbelievers to walk across the street
to see the tops of the plants.

The ﬂat roof supports 11 green, 18—gallon . ,
storage containers with tomato, rosemary,. -

cilantro,vmi_nt and basil plants. Bankert said‘
the head chef got the idea to start a rooftop
garden while looking out of his oﬂice win-
dow at the space. V

Though the garden doesn’t have the usual
pests, the plants have to overcome the hot
roof. Bankert and the chefs water the plants
three times a day. -

“It’s nice to be able to get away from the
hectic day. It’s harsh, hot and relentless,”
Bankert said. “Gardening gives you a sense
of immediate gratiﬁcation.” I

The experimental garden doesn’t yield
enough basil for all the menu items or
even themarinara sauce. The fresh basil
is adequate for items like the lemon basil
vinaigrette dressing on the grilled shrimp
salad.

Bankert looks forward to growing more
tomatoes and squash next year.

Plant to Plate plans to expand its gar-
den next year and increase its visibility.

tive tract. He believes that this organ con-
solidates the male and female desires of
a slug.

“ [A slug] wants to be promiscuous, but it
wants to be choosy. Promiscuous. Choosy.
What does it do?

“So they say, ‘Oh sure, I’ll take your sperm.
Here, you have some of mine. I’ll take your
sperm, and then I’m just going to digest it,”
Pearce said with a hushed, sly voice.

It’s uncertain whether leopard slugs can
self-fertilize. Proof would require a virgin
slug to lay eggs, which hasn’t been docu-
mented.

Little deﬁnitive research has been done
on the leopard slug, Pearce said. He, how-

_ ever," encourages people to study and grow

compassion for mollusks.

If you get slug slime on your hands, it’s
best to scrape it off with a paper towel before
washing your hands. The slime absorbs the
water and becomes slimier. Leopard slugs
make nice pets, but if the keeper grows tired

of the slugs, Pearce urges the keeper to eu-

thanize them or let them live out the rest of
their lives. Leopard slugs can live for four
years, but they tend to live shorter lives in
captivity. They shouldn’t be reintroduced
into the wild because they can alter the 10-
cal ecosystem.

Pearce sometimes holds slug races be-
tween different species of slugs to enter-
tain and educate youngsters. The setup for a
slug race is a circle within a circle. The slugs
start in the ‘inner circle and must travel the
8 inches to cross the outer circle.

_The races aren’t always exciting,
though.

“The fastest I’ve ever seen a slug run’

those 8 inches is a minute and a half, but
I’ve run races that have run for 20 minutes,
and no one has won,” Pearce said. ,

Ounce for ounce, the leopard slug isn’t
the fastest. But when it comes to slug races,

, size matters. ~So,,; in a slug race with native

species, bet on the gladiator, the great one:
Limax maximus. ,

Gorelick is glad the group has the lot on

obstacles. The group had three rain bar-

about $60. ~ .

The group has since bought a shed and
will put up a picket fence to keep people

Tough tax on  
tanning business

n those rare days when Pitts-
Oburglfs weather permits lay-
ing out in the sun — mean-
ing clear skies and temperatures that
aren’t as excruciating as seen in early
July — students in Oakland ﬂock to
lay out on the Schenley Plaza lawn
and other such grassy locations.

Then again, Pittsburgh is notori— »

ous for its overcast skies. And who
can forget last winter’s havoc-wreck-
ing, record—breaking snowstorm?
But the pale need not fear: Indoor
tanning salonswill keep thatbronze
body year round. That is unless the
new tanning tax will deter you.

Earlier this month, a national 10
percenttaxon ultraviolet indoor tan-
ning services was instated. The tax
will go toward the Patient Protection
and AffordableCareAct. You’ve prob-
ably heard of the dangers of indoor
tanning —— skin cancer, premature
aging and immune suppression, ac-
cordingto the Food and DrugAdmin-
istration. While the risks continue to
be debated, the dangers were enough
towarrantataxfrom the federal gov-
ernment. We’re used to Uncle Sam’s
taxes on items deemed unhealthy --
cigarettes and alcohol both carry sin
taxes. But this tanhingtaxfeels more
biased than other taxes and could
leave some businesses upset.

Opponents of the tax contend"

that even with any health risks as-
sociatedwith “fake baking,” tanning
the old—fashioned way in the sun is
hardly without risk. The casual tan-

ner might not take factors such as I

cloud conditions and the daily UV
index into account. Also, sometimes
those looking for a little pre-vacation
color can’t ﬁnd the time to sit out in

the sun. Even if they tan responsibly
— meaning they avoid lobster—look—

ing results —- they still have to pay _

for something that can’t be obtained
freely because of schedule, time or
any number of constraints. With the
tanning tax, of course, they’ll have

I to pay more.

Pittsburgh just isn’t California.
Or Florida. Oakland alone has a few
tanningsalons, andinareaswithlong
winters and sparse sunshine, tanning
salons are businesses that contribute
to the economy just like any other. A
10 percent tax probably won’t run
tanning venues out of business —
although the 10 percent drink tax
Allegheny County served up a couple
years ago caused areal su'r—-butina
still-stagnant economy, more money
means fewer customers.

Still, it’s hard to place a price on
beauty. Those unofficially diagnosed
with “tanorexia” probably won’t be
willing to change their habits. The
Congressional Budget Office esti-
mates this tax could bring in $2.5
billion over the next decade. '

But compared to taxes on ciga-
rettes, there’s a critical difference
in the tanning tax. Smoking is un-
deniably harmful to the health, yet
whether it’s a convenience store or a
gas station selling packs of smokes,
cigarettes probably aren’t the only
product offered. Tanning salons
might sell bottles of tanning lotion
or a collection of skimpy swimwear
on the side, but those precious mo-
ments under the ultraviolet lights will
alwaysbe their main draw. Taxingthe
featured product puts a strain on any
business, and this tax is sure to leave
some businesses feeling burned.

Stop Your fist pumping

Why do the cast members of Jersey Shore make so much money?

 
     

Leah Trimble
Columnist

I’m not afraid to admit that my
guilty pleasures include several
over-the—top reality re-runs, like
“Say Yes to the Dress” and “Iron
Chef America.” I’ve seen the same
episodes countless times, and yet

g the third bridezilla complaining

to the seamstress about the extra
eighth of an inch that must be tak-
en in doesn’t faze me. I don’t care
how many times the Iron Chefs win
in comparison to the challengers. I
still watch it, and they deserve it.

What caught me off guard dur— »

ing my ritual was the preview of
the new season of “Cake Boss,”

where, in one episode, Nicole ‘

“Snooki” Polizzi visits Carlo’s Bak-
-ery in hopes of having a specialty
cake made. The segment shows
Polizzi asking for “pumping ﬁsts”

to branch out of the cake. Though
I haven’t seen the episode, some-
thing hitia nerve about this par-
ticular clipyl thoughtlwould be
free of the horrors of bar ﬁghts and

weight lifting until July 29, when '

the new season is scheduled to'pre—
mier. But I kept thinking, was I just
irritated with her abnormally large

. “gangsta” ball cap that she places

ever-so—slightly on the top of her
big head, probably concealing a

towering “pou ,” or the faint mem- —

ory of her gulping down pickles on
national television? No, I realized
that these meatheads are getting
paid enough money that they will

never have to work another day in '

their lives — provided that the sea-
sons continue, of course —— just by
being obnoxious and “crispy.” They
don’t even have a special talent,
like singing or athleticism. They’re
just partying at a beach.

TMZ reported that each cast
member will be compensated

equally to avoid ﬁghts between the
cast members. It was conﬁrmed
that Vinny accepted the $10,000-

’per-episode contract for the'sec—

ond season of “Jersey Shore,”
implying that the others will be
handed the same amount.

The irking sensation led me to
research the cost of a famous Bud-
dy—designed specialty cake from

Carlo’s Bakery. An average cake '

costs between $12 to $18 per per-
son being served, equaling about
$2,400 at the $12 minimum for
an average wedding of 200 guests.
You can only imagine the price tag
for creating Snooki’s animated
confection. Good thing one night
of drinking for free at the bar cov-
ers the expenses of these reality

. stars. Look out, though. Their new

contract might also conﬁne them
to the amount of paid appearances
they can make_outside the show.

Reactionto ‘racist’ Time column too harsh

   

Hay Thuppal
Columnist

  

 

The July 2 issue of Time Magazine
featured a controversial column by
Joel Stein called “My Own Private
India,” causing some upset in the
South-Asian community over his
use of racist humor. Although not
extremely offended by the piece
myself, I have to wonder why Time
was willing to publish something that
would assuredly enrage an entire

‘ race of people. .

In short, Stein’s piece was an
extensivelamentation on the cur-
rent state of his hometown: Edison,

_ N .J. In the past two decades, Edison

has been the destination for many
Indian immigrants, who, in turn,
have turned it into a thriving Indian-
American’ community.

When Stein graduated from high
school in Edison, he left behind a
mostly white, suburban communi-
ty, where he learned how to shoplift

and sneak into R—rated movies. But —

with the inﬂux of Indian immigrants

who’ve taken over those businesses,
the Joel Steins of today have been
deprived of such pleasures.

Stein’s commentary starts off
innocently enough — I’ve always
beenafan of his humor— but takes
a turn that many have deemed racist
and xenophobic. He believed that
all Indians were geniuses until “the
not-as-brilliant merchants brought

multiple arms and an elephant
nose.”

Not surprisingly, Indians have
lambasted Stein across the board.
Actor Kal Penn, of the “Harold and
Kumar” movie series, responded
with a ﬁlming denouncement that
made Stein seem no better than
Glenn Beckwith his rant on the “lack
of ﬂush toilets” in ‘India.

person he was writing about.

Additionally, Stein’s feelings were
understandable. They’re probably
the same ones my parents might have
upon revisiting their hometowns and
seeing how they’ve changed. In his
article, Stein makes it clear that he is
not against the evolution of his com-
munity. He is simply observing the
shift from his childhood days.

“ If anything, I found fault with Time for publishing

their even—less—bright cousins, and
[he] started to understand why India
is so darrm poor.” '

After reading it in full, it’s easy to
understand why Indian-Americans
were so offended by Stein’s column.
He points out the irony of a town
named for the United States’ most
famous inventor. becoming a haven.
for immigrants, but probably takes

' it a bit too far when he mentions the

missed opporttmity for jokes about

“a group of people whose gods have .

  Stein’s article as it was.”

Another response, published in

‘the Atlantic, demonstrated “how to

make fun of Indian-American irnmi-
grants.” The author, instead of sim-
ply critiquing Stein, also provided a
detailed explanation of what types of
Indian—based humorwas acceptable.
In essence, you have to be Indian if
you want to make fun of Indian peo-
ple, according to this entry. , '
But when viewed from afar, the

4 response to Stein’s article seems a

bit much, even for me, as the kind of

Sure, his choice of words could’ve
been better, but his opinions are
probably commonplace in the liv-
ing rooms of his former neighbors
from Edison.

In fact, even I was under some
of the same beliefs that Stein held

about Indians. Having grown up in '

this country, I also “assumed all In-
dians were geniuses” until I came to
realize that wasn’t the case.

If anything, I found fault with
Time for publishing Stein’s article

as it was. I have a hard time believ-
ing that they didn’t expect this kind
of backlash. »

I would’ve let Stein off the hook,
claimingthat hewas only beingtruth—
fuL But his course of action following
the reaction to his column should’v_e
been an apology, not the following
reply on Twitter: “Didn’t [mean] to
insult Indians with my column this
week. Also stupidly assumed their
e-mails would- follow that Gandhi
non—violence thing.”

Well, I guess Stein and Time
ﬁnally came to their senses and is-
sued an apology in the form of an
appended statement to the column
onJuly 2. But I can’t say the same for
the South-Asian community.

The general resentment for Stein
has continued past his apology.

I think my Indian brethren might
just need to calm down and see this
situation forwhat it actually is: a mis-
cue on the part of Time for publishing
someone’s real, unabashed feelings,
not an attack on our way. of life.

less than four nights a week of paid
barhopping would be devastatin ,
don’t you think? ’
If drinking doesn’t cover the
costs, there are always other op-
tions. Mike “The Situation” Sor-

‘ rentino’s supposed new cologne,

called “Sitch,” is scheduled to_
launch in a few months. Jenni
“JWoWW” Farley also debuted her
new clothing line, Filthy Couture,
along with her new website.

Let’s not forget that, despite the
ridiculousness of this whole situ-

ation —— no pun intended — they
are famous purely for being tanned

and having a, let’s say interesting, '

sense of their heritage. MTV, it’s
really cool to promote that beauty
comes from going tanning every
day. Just keep embracing the fact
that one—in-ﬁve people will de-
velop skin cancer in his lifetime.
It’s an awesome idea to provide»
fame and luxury to individuals who
promote these rituals, aside from
all the other actions that are de-
cently dangerous. I’m all for having

a good time on the weekend and
looking my best, but I don’t get
paid 10 grand per episode to be
pale and walk around Oakland in
the summerwith my friends.
The sad thing is, I actually
understand why people watch
it. The ridiculousness of these
people makes me laugh hysteri-
cally. And don’t get me wrong, of
course I would live on the beach
to make that kind of money. All
in all, I guess I just don’t getlthe
attraction to having wrinkles in

10 years or beating the snot out
of every partying girl who crosses
my path. I’m not trying to get with
every “gorilla” I see on campus.
I have a large percentage of Ital-
ian in my background, yet I would
never take pride in being called a
“guidette.”

Obviously‘not bothered, the
crew will continue the drama,
bringing Angelina back and par-
taking in many more ﬁghts, among
other entertaining occurrences.
But go ahead Snooki — tan, pouf

FOOD

The sweetest of,
the sweet

A report on some of Pittsburgh’s best ice cream

john Manganaro
Contributing Editor

It’s a chocolate and vanilla show-
down. We visited four popular
Pittsburgh ice cream shops and got
two simple scoops at each. No top-
pings, no cones, no nonsense.

Oh Yeah! ,

Texture: Scooped ice cream,
blended by a foot-long corkscrew
producing a ﬁrm, but soft frozen
desert. The texture is the high
point of this shop’s dense treat.
Highly creamy and heavy, this ice
cream explores the third realm
between soft serve and scoop.

Taste: The chocolate and vanil-
la are straightforward and simple,

but that matches well with the bold

texture. And with more than 100
mix-ins, the balanced taste serves
as a capable platform for any ex-
treme mix you can think of, even
goat cheese and strawberries.
Hipster factor: Oh Yeah! is only
matched in hipness by its patrons.
Carved oak paneling, myriad high-
way signs mixed with local paint-
ers, magazine racks, wall-length
bookshelves and plenty of space to
enjoy your amorphous treats.

Milk Shake Factory

Texture: Deﬁnitely not soft serve;
desert from the Milk Shake Fac-
tory is only scooped out from the
tub with diﬂiculty. Surprisingly,

. the ice cream’s ﬁrmness does not

translate to denseness, and the
treat has an airy, almost whipped
style.

Taste: Not for the weak heart-
ed, the Milk Shake Factory clearly
had the boldest taste of all the
sampled shops. The chocolate is
dark and nutty, a coco ﬂavor that is
not too sweet. The vanilla is pow-
erful as well, a deep ﬂavor that
hangs around the mouth.

Hipster factor: Asleek, open,
modern feel that meshes well
with the South Side Scene. Mir-
rors, glass, hardwood ﬂoors and
a blood—red Victorian ceiling with
hanging chandeliers set the scene

for some serious ice cream enjoy-
ment. l A

Klavon’s

Texture: Not quite as centrist as -

Oh Yeah!, Klavon’s also toes the
line between soft serve and scoop
ice cream. Traditional is the key
word here, a fulﬁlling —- and ﬁll-

ing —— balance between ice and ‘

cream.

Taste: Traditional does not
always mean restrained, and
Klavon’s proves that maxim. By
sticking to the basic ﬂavors, with
only a few ﬂares, these chocolate
and vanilla ﬂavors are true to ice
cream traditions. The vanilla is
sweet but also full, and the choco-
late is dark, approaching bitter.

Hipster factor: The ice cream

is not the only thing traditional ,

about Klavon’s. The shop stands in
what used to be a pharmacy, and
the store brings patrons back to
the days where ice cream shops,
soda fountains and pharmacies
were all one. If you want your
desert with a dose of nostalgia,
Klavon’s is the place to get it.

Dave and Andy’s
Texture: A dense, creamy scooped
style; Dave and Andy’s serves malt
ice cream, which has very little air
whipped in and feels heavier than
other versions of the frozen treat.
Good luck eating with the ﬂimsy
plastic spoon in which its served.
Taste: Not as strong or sub-

A neighborhod revived  

' Kelsey Shea

When Jason Sauer bought and

empty storefront at 5015 Penn
Ave., he and his friend Jeff used
to_sit out front with his German
shepherd at night to keep away
the nightly crime that infected
the neighborhood. His apart-
ment was broken into twice.

‘The street was pretty wild.
We just set out shop out there,”
he said.

Three years and a lot of con-
struction later, Sauer’s once run-
down and empty store front is
now the art gallery and music
venue Most Wanted Fine Art, and
the crowds passing by outside
aren’t hookers and crackheadsv.
They’re art lovers and young 20-
something’s bouncing from one
bar or gallery to another. A

“It’s made a 180-degree turn,”
Sauer said of Penn Avenue.
“There’s people walking around
with their dogs. They’re holding
hands. It’s great.”

Most Wanted Fine Art’s story

coincides with the street it grew
up on, the 4800—5500thoblocks'
of Penn Avenue that run through

— Friendship. Through the ’90s,

Penn Avenue was plagued by

crime, drugs and prostitution, ,

before the Penn Arts Initiative
was formed in 1998 as an attempt
to use art ‘to turn the neighbor-
hood around.

 Since its start in ’98, the ini-
tiative has reduced’ the vacancy

along Penn Avenue from 78 per- ‘

cent to 21.37 percent and con-
verted nearly 150,000 square
feet of vacant property into art-
ists’ homes and workspaces. It’s
awarded more than $60,000 to,
about 60 local artists and youth
programs as well as distributed
more than $100,000 in grant
money and $130,000 in loans
to artists.

' The startling success and
creativéfsolutions the Penn Av-
enue Arts Initiative have found
in.reviving Friendship are pretty
revolutionary and unique.

not always traditional manner.”
The initiative was named in

50 Cultural Forces of the Decade.

cently spoke at a conferenceain

partnership between The Friend-
ship Associates and The Bloom-
ﬁeld Garﬁeld Corporation, which
cameup with a strategy and a
mission for the project and hired
two full—time staff members to
make it happen.

The Initiative’s mission state-
ment is “to revitalize the Penn

Avenue Corridor, between Neg-V

ley and Mathilda avenues, by
using the arts to enhance public
perception of the district, instill
pride in the neighborhood, foster
inter- and intra—community ties
andestablish an artist’s niche.”
The two non—proﬁt organi-
zations decided that the way to
revive the community and fulﬁll
its mission statement was to fo-
cus on the major artery that ran

throughthe community: Penn j
— " rals, new housing, artists loans

Avenue.

director, the Friendship com-

, munity was full of 400 artists

that they considered a great as-
set to the community and a slew
of vacant buildings that were

hindering it. They decided that
they wanted to combine the two
to create a new arts district in
the city.

Through grants from Pitts-
burgh’s Urban Redevelopment
center, private foundation and
state funding, the Penn Arts Ini-
tiative bought 16 buildings, tax

free.’ as i.t’s.a n9.n.-proﬁt,-.   .5 .
It then turned the buildings 7

around by selling them to artists,
like Sauer, and provided the art-
ists with loans, to renovate them
into galleries and businesses on
the ground floors and apartments
and studios on the upper stories,
said DiLeo. _

From there, as the new

' storefronts grew, other projects

sprouted up to further supple-
ment the neighborhood, like mu-

and! additional grants.

Having been with the Initiative
from the start, DiLeo has seen the
great transition its made.

“Just to see it grow has been
really great,” she said. “It’s a won-
derful thing to be a part of.”

A HOME FOR THE ARTS

Now, it’s the first Friday of
the month, and the Initiative’s
monthly event, Unblurred, has
people roaming in and out of
open galleries on Penn Avenue
with no reservations about the

. neigh15.o.r,h¢os1’s‘safetyr ..

“We started Unblurred just to
get people walking up Penn Av-
enue,” DiLeo said. “People used
to be too afraid.”

Penn Avenue is now home to u
22 galleries and theaters in its

4800-5500 blocks, including
Garﬁeld Artworks, Pittsburgh
Glass Center and Dance Alloy
Theater. I ‘

Outside the walls of galleries,
the community of artists has cre-
ated several pieces of public art
to further spruce up the avenue.
Since 2001, seven murals were
painted on the walls of various
businesses.

The initiative’s latest project,
Green and Screen, also focuses
onthe aesthetics of the street.

DiLeo explained that it’s trying
to “ﬁll in the missing pieces of
the block.”

It’s spent $58 million on ﬁx-
ing up the facades of buildings
along the avenue and landscaping
parking lots and empty spaces on
the avenue.

A HOME FOR PITTSBUR-
GHERS

As well as making Penn Avenue
a home for the arts, the Initia-
tive wanted to make it a home
for people, as well.

And like the galleries, it start-
ed with the artists. The grants
that the artists received covered
the renovation of the entire
buildings, not just the bottom
ﬂoors.

After, the artists started build-
ing housing, and apartments ﬁrst
started inﬂuencing landlords
to stop splitting old Victorian
homes into seven or eight apart-
ments. By creating larger spaces,
they hoped to up property value
and draw in families rather than

renters.

And property values are up
in the neighborhood. DiLeo es-
timates that Friendship prop-
erty sold for about $30,000 to
$50,000 in the late ’90s, whereas
now Penn Avenue properties
are valued at about $150,000 to
$500,000.

Another major. achievement
for the community’s housing
needs was getting rid of some
of the absentee landlords in the
neighborhood.

In an attempt to control the
crime and get the landlords to
take responsibility for the prop-
erty, in one case members of the
Friendship community ﬂyered
the landlord’s neighborhood with
signs that said, “Did you know
your neighbor is an absentee
landlord?” The landlord sold the
property soon after.

DiLeo said that after that inci-
dent, the property was renovated
and is now one of the “hidden
gems of our neighborhood. It’s
a great story, too.”

his 6th annual weekend celebration is filled with back to back entertainment, musicians,
an Artist's Market, Kid's Korner, Sidewalk Sale, food, dancing, drinks & more.

“The Sorcerer’s Apprentice’-’ Thumbs
“P

I see Nicolas Cage with his ratty long hair,
black leather trench coat and a crazed-
man-on-a—mission stare and think," “This
feels right.” Cage is a solid PG to PG-13
movie adventure hero, and he delivers

, once again in “The Sorcerer’s Apprfentice.”

The Disney action-adventure movie comes
from the same director as “National
Treasure,” and the movie is like “National

, Treasure” but with physics, instead of

history, saving the day. Though it can’t .

compete with'Harry Potter and his pals,
“The Sorcerer’s Apprentice” is the most
electrifying magic movie of the summer.

“Get Him to the Greek” Thumbs up

Banking off a side plot from “Forgetting
Sarah Marshall” was genius for director
Nicholas Stoller. “Get Him to the Greek”

is, in a word, hilarious. Fuzzy walls, “Afri-g A

can Child” and Russell Brand’s awesome
performance puts “Get Him to the Greek”
on the same level as “The Hangover.”
-Kelsey Shea '

“Prince of Persia” Thumbs down
Putting slightly tweaked scenes from
every major action blockbuster in the
past decade doesn’t equal an epic master-
piece in the world of ﬁlm making. In fact,
it makes a fairly predictable and mildly
amusing souped up “Aladdin.” But hey,

it could have been worse._]ake Gyllenhaal
could have worn a shirt.

-Kelsey Shea

“Eclipse” Thumbs down

So for any other series, I would bash this
movie to bits for being corny, predictable
and all—around lame. But considering the
past two “Twilight” movies, this is by far
the strongest and even a little bit funny at

 

.- times. All the :same,.:it’s still full of mushy

romantic junk. Thumbs down.
-Kelsey Shea

“The Last Airbender” Thumbs down ' ‘
Really, what is there to say about “The
Last Airbender?” I guess I’ll start with

the positives: Dev Patel looks damn sexy _
as the brooding banished Prince Zuko,
though his performance is hardly equal to
his work in “Slumdog Millionaire.” Unfor-
tunately, the rest of the cast -—— comprised

“ of forgettable child actors and middle:
’ aged C—listers —— ‘were at times stale, while

at others, overly affected. I had "hoped the

one savior of this movie, which chronicles V

a worldvlof elementbéndingiand,mysti¥   ’

‘  w6u1d~’15eits-.s:séc1a1;léﬁ‘ectsfyét*"  “

those, too, were disappointing — I saw
Matilda throw water around in 1996.

In short, the movie, like M. Night Shya—
malan’s directorial career, limps along like
a mangled’ deer looking for a-place to die.
-Molly Green ' ’

“Splice” Thumbs down

Throw “Frankenstein,” “Rosemary’s
Baby” and some scientiﬁc jargoninto a .
blender for about a minute. Then freeze it
for a while to make sure all of the life gets
sucked out of it and put the result in front
of a camera. That is the basic premise of
“Splice.”

-Mike Macagnone

“Grown Ups” Thumbs up

“Grown Ups” boasts an all—star army of
comedic valor with Adam Sandler, Rob
Schneider, Kevinjames, Chris Rock and

David Spade. But surprisingly, their gooﬁ-

ness is overshadowed by the overall — get
ready for this, folks — plot of the movie.
There is, in fact, more to “Grown Ups”
than stupid humor. The movie centers ,
around the theme of family and the real-

“Sex and the City 2” Thumbs up

This fashionable sequel was lnotic'e‘ablyl

Fans of the series will likely be happy just

“Despicible Me” Thumbs up i _
This tale of super—vi1lain—turned—softie was
good, but not great. When sized up against
the animated greats, it doesn’t have the
perfectly paced plot or nuanced writing

of former genre triumphs like “Finding
Nemo” or “Shrek.” That being said, it

was entertaining and, at times, hilarious,
with much of the humor coming from

the character Agnes (Elsie Fisher) and

the comically childlike, Mexican jump-

ing bean-shaped minions. Steve”Carell, as '

lead villain Gru, was at times laugh—out—
loud funny, though at others, his Russian
accent began to wear on the mind like a

‘ —Molly Green

“Toy Story 3” Thumbs up '

The wizards at Pixar have done it again.
“Toy Story 3” follows the ﬁnal adventure
of Woody and Co. This ﬁlm is more heart-
felt and, surprisingly, more human than

anythingelse you’ll.see this summer. Pixar _ ’

continuesyto perfectits animation, creat-T
ing unbelievably realistic worlds in every

frame. With artists this dedicated, there is

no need to see “Toy Story 3” in 3-D.
-Anne Grushecky A «

“The A-Team” Thumbs up

Formulaic, cheesy, but fun with some
memorable scenes‘. Think parachuting
tanks and plenty of 50 cals. The ﬂick may
offer solidarity to casual fans nostalgic for
’8os action television, but Mr. T diehards
will probably walk away wanting. Overall,
this lighthearted remake has all the neces-
sary actionblended with 2010 special
effects — a real romp. P

McGhee improves at

Alex Oltmanns
Sports Editor
o

LeBron]ames was under the spot-
light last week as his free-agency
decision made headlines.
But if you were to look just
outside that spotlight, you could
ind Pitt‘ senior center Gary
McGhee and some of the elite
college basketball players in the
country attending James’ skills
camp in Akron, Ohio.
You might be thinking, the
~samelGary McGhee who com-
mitted three fouls in 18 seconds

<"‘W

 

 

on Connecticut center Hasheem
Thabeet two seasons ago? A sea-
son in which he averaged just
more than one point, one re-
bound and six minutes of play-
ing time per game?

Well, yes, technically it is the
same McGhee. But the center has
improved since then and trans-
formed into a much different
player on the court.

“It’s really rewarding going
from a guy who didn’t play as

many minutes my first two years,” ‘

McGhee’said. “You know three
fouls in what is it eight seconds

to get invited to something like

that with‘ all the top players in

the nation. If feels good. It shows _

that hard work does pay off.”
McGhee, who looks like a

' changedplayer so far in the

local Pro—Am summer league,
was invited to James’ camp af-
ter performing well at Amar’e
Stoudemire’s camp for centers

— and forwards last month in Chi-

cago. V

Some of the top players at
that camp got to go to Akron,
but McGhee didn’t even know he

. would be participating until he

got word after his ﬂight home
to Indiana for the Fourth of July

weekend landed.

After riding a Greyhound bus

' from his hometown of Anderson,

Ind., to Akron, McGhee began

working to improve his games

amongst players such as Florida’s
Vernon Macklin (whom McGhee
said was his toughest competi-
tion), Duke’s Kyle Singler and
Nolan Smith and Georgetown’s
Chris Wright.

That type of competition
might make some players feel in-
timidated, but McGhee said that
playingin the Big East against
other topjbig men prepared him
for the  level of competi-

   

“'Jr'5=-*.’:“«‘,“‘.".-"?"',".

LeBronfJames’ camp

1 tion.

“On a nightly basis in the Big

‘East, you play against some of the

same type of players,” he said.
“So it’s just like a regular day.”

He participated in a lot of
four-on-four and transition
drills and learned from people
such as Jay Bilas and Fran Fra-
schilla, while also playing in a
lot of scrimmages mixed in as
we1l.’But what he focused on the
most‘ was his footwork and of-
fensive skills.

“I tried to work on a lotof foot-
work stuff, working on moves, a
lot of hook shots,” McGhee said.

Miami Heat. Signing Bosh and

James and re—signing Wade for dis-

counted prices all in one offseason?

- Any Heat fans out there wantto buy
me a Powerball ticket?

Spain. It won the FIFA World

Cup for the ﬁrst time, becoming
only the eighth country to win it.
The ﬁnals game against the Nether-
lands, however, left much to be de-
sired. The match perfectly summed
up the entire tournament with its
abundance of shoddy oﬂiciating
combined with player dives, fake
injuries and missed opportunities.
Is it just me, or does anybody else
ﬁnd it appalling that whenever
there is a strong gust of wind, a
player falls over and holds his face/
leg/chest in an acting display so
bad it makes Joe Nedney look like
Robert De Niro, all in the hopes
of drawing a foul on whomever is
standing closest to him? That is
one aspect that soccer needs to im-
prove upon if it everwants to catch
on in the United States. Anyway,
congrats to Spain and the Nether-
lands, as well, for outstanding tour-
naments, even if the ﬁnals game
didn’t live up to expectations.

Pirates promotions aplenty this summer

Tony Jovenitti

The Pirates are the best team in baseball.
There I said it. Nobody else even comes
close.

By now it should be apparent that
I’m not judging the Pirates based off of
meaningless stats such as hits or wins.
The Pirates are the best team in terms of
promotions and giveaways.

Where else can you go to a Major League
Baseball game and get a really nice piece
of memorabilia for free every time? The
answer is nowhere. The Pirates manage-
ment has perfected the art of producing a
losing product on the ﬁeld yet still putting
butts in the seats because of the unbeatable
promotions.

So in the spirit of summer, here are my
top 10 best PNC Park promotions for the
rest of the season. If you plan on going to
a Pirates game, make sure you check the
list first.

10. Every Thursday Home Game — T-

shirt Thursday: That’s right, every Thurs-
day game, every fan in attendance receives
a free T-shirt. Who doesn’t love a free T-
shirt, even if it is three sizes too big?

9.July 16 vs. Houston Astros — Beach
Towel: They call it a beach towel, but I
have bath towels that are bigger than this.
However, it’s always nice to have a new bath
towel. I always ruin my towels cleaning up
kitchen spills, anyway. And if it happens
to rain during the game, you can easily
dry off.

8. Saturday, Aug. 21 vs. New York
Mets — Pittsburgh Crawfords Caps:
If there’s one thing the Pirates’ market-
ing team is good at, it’s making you think
about the past while you try to forget about
how many games behind .500 the Pirates
are. This is one of those giveaways. The
Crawfords were a Negro League baseball
team from 1930-38, and they even won
two titles. ‘ _. ' '

7. Friday, Aug. 20 vs. New York Mets
— Pirates Poster: Every time I walk into
my bedroom, I see a bare wall. If you’re like
me, I don’t want to have to go out and actu-
ally buy something to ﬁll that space. Well,

First time overseas

In addition to playing games, "Pitt will meet with Art Rooney

the team will learn how it is going to “or-
chestrate the offense” without Jermaine
Dixon, who graduated last year.

Brown said the team would also have to
work to perform from a defensive stand-

situations.

“By the time fall comes around, we’ll
already be gelling as a team and already
have high expectations for what we’re go-
ing to do on the court,”_ he said.

Going-overseas, with my teammates and
lgiettlng the pchances to play brasketball on
top of that, we the best thing ever;

point without Dixon, the defensive leader
for the Panthers last season.

Overall, Richardson said the trip will
not only help the Panthers play together
on the court, but it will also have a positive
effect for the team off the court.

‘ “It will help us bond,” Richardson said.

‘-‘We’re already a close team now. We hang

_ out after practice and stuff like that. It

will help us come together more, which
will help us exceed further.” .

The experience will give Pitt an ad-
vantage once the season begins, Brown
said, because the players will know what
to expect from one another in real-game

The Panthers will also get the chance

to experience Ireland outside a basketball’

arena, including two tourldays in Dublin
and hotel stays in three different cities:
Dublin, Cork and Belfast.

On Aug. 2, Dan Rooney, Pittsburgh
Steelers owner and U.S. ambassador to Ire-
land, invited the team for a reception.

The Panthers will meet with Peace-
Players International, an organization

that promotes peacebetween Protestant

and Catholic children in Ireland using the
game of basketball, and will also visit the
Children’s Hospital branch of the Beacon
Hospital, which is managed by UPMC.

McGhee ‘a changed player’

Lucas Felakl SENIOR STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER
Gary McGhee defends against Louisville’s Samardo Samuels in Pitt’s overtime victory.

McGhee ( 18

“It was a good experience to learn some
things.” I g
It didn’t take long for McGhee’s team-
mates to notice a difference in his game.
“He had a big confidence change. He’s

playing more aggressive now,,an_d he’s got V>

an array of moves,” sophomore forward].J.
Richardson said. “His footwork got better.
He’s more of a leader nowf’

Sophomore forward Dante Taylor
added that McGhee’s improvement will
make himthat much tougher to guard in
practice, but that it can only help him and
the other Panther forwards get better in
the process. . .

“It’s helping me on defense and on of-
fense, too, because I can learn some moves
from him,” Taylor said.

McGhee helping the younger players
is exactly what former Pitt center Dejuan
Blair did to a younger McGhee before he

passed the_starting spot over to him last‘

season by entering the NBA draft.

He averaged 6.8 points and 6.9 re-
bounds last season, numbers that should
signiﬁcantly increase this season, and is
following in Blair’s footsteps going into his
last season .as..a Panther, a-s»McGheerwill
also look to be the dominant inside force
on a preseason top 10 team. ‘

And while McGhee might not have the
stats that Blair had, his work this sum-
mer might have just put him on the radar
of some NBA scouts, because at ,6 feet,
10 inches and 250 pounds, he certainly
has the physical attributes needed to be
a center at the next level.

That will all play itself out going for-
ward and is uncertain at this point, but
Richardson might have put it best when
he pointed out something that does seem
certain right now after McGhee returned
from Akron. '

“He came back a changed player.”< _

though bobbleheads stopped being cool 10
years ago, that doesn’t stop sports teams
from making dolls that vaguely resemble
players and giving them out to fans. This
is a specialone for Pirates fans, because in

10 years, when McCutchen is winning the.

World Series with the Yankees, Bucs fans
can say, “Hey, I have a bobblehead of him
"from when he played for the Pirates.”
5. Friday, Sept. 24 vs. Astros — Pi-
rates Fleece Scarf & Gloves Set: During
ahe ﬁnal series of the season, the Pirates
will help fans prepare for another snowy
winter by handing out Pirates gloves and
scarves to every fan. So now, instead of
complaining about the cold of winter when
you step outside, you will be reminded of
futile Pittsburgh summers.

3. Friday, Sept. 17 vs. Diamondbacks
—— Roberto Clemente Bronze Bust: A mini
statue of the best Pirate in history will be
handed out. Another giveaway to make
you think about the past.

2. Friday, Sept. 3 vs. Nationals — Pi-
rates Fleecie: No one is entirely certain
what a “fleecie” is, but I’m guessing it’s a
knock-off Snuggie. If that’s the case, then
imagine everyone in the stands wearing
a Snuggie during the games. And if the
Pirates somehow lose to the Nationals,
then I’m pretty sure Pirates fans would
be the ﬁrst in history to cover their faces

>r— with Snuggies instead of paper bags.

1. Post-game Concerts: The Pirates’

V marketing team struck gold when it came

up with this idea. Not only. do post-game
concerts sell out the stadium, but they
actually make people stay for the whole
game. For all the other giveaways, fans can
leave in the first inning and still have their
awesome Clemente statues. There are still
four concerts left: July 24 — Steve Miller
Band, Aug. 7 —. George Thorogood, Sept.
4 — Luke Bryan and Sept. 25"‘-— O.A.R.'

had beaten Ghana, which it should have, it

certainly do-able. Then it would have had a

Losers

LeBron]ames. Did you really need hold
a one-hour primetime special to announce
your decision? Leaving Cleveland is one
thing, (I don’t blame him at all. I hate Cleve-
land), but holding the press conference was
quite possibly the most conceited thing in
thehistory of sports. This _showed a com-
plete lack of class and very well could tarnish
James’ “legacy” unless he wins ﬁve titles
while in Miami.

World Cup officials. If you watched the
World Cup at all, you know how bad it was.
Seriously, that is the top sports event in the
entire freakin’ world, getsome competent
ofﬁcials. Or replay, your choice FIFA.

Cleveland. Imagine you’re an average-
looking guy who somehow scored the hot-
test chick in school. But then she holds an
assembly to announce she is dumpingyou for

:

the handsome new hotshot quarterback that
just moved to your school. Oh, and did I men-
tion that you also play quarterback? That’s
how Cleveland feels right now. Suddenly Art
Modell isn’t so hated anymore.

Atlanta Thrashers. First they lost Ilya
Kovalchuk, then they traded for the over-
rated Dustin Byfuglien —— yes I realize he was
awesome in the playoffs, but did you watch
the regular season by chance? — and gave
up their top prospect to do so. They also let
solid players Colby Armstrong, Pavel Kubina
andjohan Hedberg leave. And did I mention
that the new players all want raises?

Pittsburgh Pirates. As a diehard Pitts-
burgh sports fan, the Pirates break my heart
every year. I pray each spring that this is the
year we break the streak, but alas, it is not so.
With the worst record in the National League, . .
a maddeningly -inconsistent pitching staff
and an inept manager, things look terrible.
