UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Van Dusen Outlines Studies

Handling Urban Problems

by PAUL -STOLLER

Dr. A. C. Van Dusen, vice-
chancellor for Program and
Development, announced that
the University is now engag-
ing in a variety of urban
programs ranging from com-
munity work to urban so-
cial psychology studies in a
Pitt News interview Monday.

“The University of Pittsburgh
has many resources which can
be helpful and it has declared
the City and Urban living as one
of its major concerns. The Ghan-

cellor. has created the Univers1i- '

ty Council on urban efforts .. .”
declared Van Dusen in a recent
address. The Vice-chsancellor has
recently been appointed chair-
man of that council.

Under th-e auspices of the
Council on Urban Programs, the
urban activity of the University
-has been divided into - three
areas: professional schools,
Graduate School of Public and
Internati~onal Affairs (GSPIA) ,
and the College of Arts and
Sciences.

Dr. Van Dusen has noted that
in the realm of the social and

physical sciences “geographers,
economists, and sociologists are
needed in a city planning agen-
cy; chemists and statisticians
become important members of a
public health department.” He
further maintained: “The fac-
ulty of the arts and sciences,
then, produces the physical and
social scientists and the human-
ists for these ﬁelds and for pos-
itions of civic responsibility.”

In the area of the arts and
sciences, the University has pro-
grams in Urban Government,
Citizenship, Urban Geography,
Public Finance, Computer Cen-
ter, and Urban Planning and

Students Register Distress
Over Lack of State Funds

The Pitt News is running the accompanying form again to em-
phasize the importance of students voicing their displeasure over the

“The pro-fessional schools,”
said Dr. Van Dusen, “on the
other hand, turn out a Variety
of urban practitioners-people
traincd in enducation, environ-
mental health, engineering, Twa-
ter resources — pro-f-essions in
social welfare, law enforcement,
public works, and m-edical care.

“Our formal programs in ur-
ban studies prepare young men
and women to analyze the struc-
ture and character of an urban
region, to plan an entire metro-
politan area, or to redevelop ,a
central city. Graduates from the
professions,” said Van Dusen,
“go into renewal programs, deal
with civil rights and community
tensions, and manage munici-
palities and public authorities.”

Dr. Van Dusen also empha-
sized that “members of our part-
time faculty hold important pos-
-itions in our city’s government
and urban action agencies. Many
of ou-r full-time ﬁaculty are di-
recting research and lending
«counsel on the solutions of our
city's problems.”

The third area of University
urban ptrog-rams is centered in
GSPIA. The department of Ur-
ban Affairs has programs for
Urban and Regional Planning,
Urban and Executive Adminis-
tration. The Institute of Local
Government maintains an in-
service training for Urban offi-
cials and consulting services for
research.

Dr. Van Dusen made special
mention of the Center for Be-
gional Economic Studies. “The
Center . . . conducted the orig-
inal economic survey of Appala-
chia.

“A University can help to pro-
vide the basic technology and
the creative thinking which can
lead to ultimate solutions,” con-
cluded Dr. Van Dusen.

Ministry Peace Service

Finds Probable Arson

Amidst ‘Friendliness’

by JOHN CAYWOOD

A very serious discussion
took place Monday evening
at the Oakland Ministry, and
apparently an arsonist sus-
pected its seriousnesss. Dr.
James Holland took the pul-
pit right on time —— and then
promptly asked everyone to
leave because of a ﬁre in the
basement.

Two pumpers and a ladder
truck arrived within a few min-
utes and dragged four charred
ch-airs and 3. smouldering can-
vas from the church basement.
The battalion ch-ief’:s comments:
probable arson, -cause unknown.
The Arson squad was called.

People began to ﬁle in again
at 8:40, and ﬁve minutes later
the program began with singer-
guitarlst Hal Robinson. He play-
ed songs of the times -of trouble,
of the Vietnam war, and of seg-
re-glation. This trouble note was
deepetn-e.d by the hazy, -grey
smoke lingering in the rafters,
and the incense of smouldering
rags.

To -this tone of hatred and
narrowmindedness Rev. James
Gardener opposed one of friend-
liness and love: “We open our
doors and welcome all.” We
have .a right to say what we
want to say, he said, and we
sympathize with those now ﬁght-
ing 'in Vietnam who cannot es-
cape the system. ‘To the govern-
ment, he said, “We will identify
ourselves,” and not accept the
role of self-righteous policemen
of the universe that our govern-
ment has created.

The re-marks of Rt. Rev. Msgr.
Charles Owen Rice were simi-
lar, but more militant.

Of the following 11 speakers,
several good arguments against

Appoints Department Head

Donald C. Kruper, Ph.D., research associate in the psycho-bio
logy labora-tory at Monteﬁore Hospital, has been named associate
pro-fessnor «and head of the Department of Dental Behavioural Sci-
ence in the School of Dental Medicine at the University. Dr. Krup-
er has also received a point appointment in the University's De-
partment of Pyschology. Both are to take effect Jan. 1.

A native of Smithton, Pa., he received a BS. degree in zoology
in 1955, an M.S. degree in 1957 and a Ph.D. degree in 1960 in psy-
chology, all at the University. He received further post-doctoral
training in experimental psychology at the Unive-rsuity and at Mon-
teﬁore Hospital and has served as supervisor of the primate re-
search lab at Monteﬁore for the past six yea-rs.

He has been with the ‘teaching staff at the UniversLity’s Depart-
ment of Psychology since 1957, including service on the graduate

faculty. He has also served as

lecturer in psychology at -the

on brain function and learning

tion of Vietnam is ended."

the draft were made. One of the
-least logical yet most relevant
«arguments is that based on hu-
manism and love. Dave Morri-
son, a graduate cherni-stry stu-
dent, had this to say: “I believe
in love, and I cannot accept or
support a system that imposes
the teachinsg of killing.” And,
“Rather than leave my home, I
will stay and try to correct it.”

A statement of Tom Rolfe,
now serving four years for
breaking his probation by pm-
ticipating in an anti-war idem-
onstration, was read by James
Cipher. His statement‘ read in
part, I oppose the /war because
all war is insane. In this I act
for my conscience, for God, and
for all men. “I am for life and
human existence.”

Ted Marsh, who attended a
University graduate school and
who is now teaching in the
P-ittisburgh area believes that
-the Selective Service «act is un-
con.stliturUion1al, in that it violates
an ind»ivridual"s right to life.
How, he asked, can a state ask
a man to give his life while de-
fending his rights.

A University -history grad stu-
dent, Joshua Chason, added to

this that we as a people have A

little access to political power,
and most of us are content to
exist in our own secure little
worlds. Opposition to the draft
is an expression of opposition
to this political power «structure.

Ed Fuller, a C-MU graduate
student in computer science,
gave a very forrceful explication
of the reasons he sees the war
in Vietnam as madness, “bloody
madtness.” He traced the stages
of the war, .and conscluuded by
vaffirmin-g Martin Luther King's
demand for a revolution of val-
ues. I
Other lesser rpointls were made,
-and three poems were read. But
the major objections voiced con-
cerned humanism, the justice
and equity of the Selection Serv-
ice System, the effects on for-
eign policy, the indefensilbiliuty
of the war, and the implications
this 'pro«testi:n-g has for the fu-
ture of the country.

At the end of -the speakers,
Msgr. Rice again took the podi-
um, and officially declared ‘him-
self as opposing the draft sys-
tem. He then called for the pro-
testers to bring forward their
draft card, 12 responded. At the
call for signed petitions sup-
porting these men, 50 to 375 peo-
ple came forward.

Msgr. Rice ended the program
with these words: “We are
stronger than the violent, though
they have more force. We will
grow, they will decline. We will
not stop-. Force of the spirit will
stop this evil thing." There will
ot-her obstacles, he said, but,
“We will not ﬂinch until the
war is ended, until the destruc-

Standards of Immigration

WASHINGTON (CPS) —— The
factors used by Canadian offi-

now been revised and codiﬁed
in a point system.

This system replaces old reg-
ulations und-er which some
would - be rnignrants could be
turned down '.by an immigration
officer because of a single de-
ﬁciency. Any immigranrt scor-
ing 50 out of a ,possible 100 “as-
sessment un-ilts” will now be ad-
mitted to Canada.

The scoring under the new
system is as follows:

> Education and training, 20
units. ‘One unit for each year of
schooling or training.

>Arranged employment, ten
units if the applicant has ar-
ranged employment in Canada
or has received offers en a pre-
vious visit.

‘Dial a Test’ For Hearing Meets
Success, Continues Six Months

Six months ago, the Pitts-

-burgh Hearing and Speech So

ciety intiated the telephone hear-
ing screening test called “Dial-
a-Hearing-Test” for the ﬁ1I‘S‘t
time in the Pittsburgh area.
Due to ‘the tremendous pub-
lic response, this -telephone hear-
ing screening service will be
continued for an additional six
month period.
Dial-a-Hearing-Test consists of
a recording running approxi-
mate one and one-half minutes.
By calling 333-9311 (Area Code
412), a person will be given full
instructions as to how to pro-
ceed. The test consists «of four
tone present-atio~ns for each ear.
If he does not hear all tones,
he will be advised to visit a-n
ear doctor.
Dial-a-I{ea.ring’"l lTest was ini-

 

tiated at the society under the
auspices of Delta Zeta National
Sorority, which has a chapter at
the University, and Sertoma
Club of Pittsburgh. The contin-
ued sponsorship by these groups
has made {the continuation of
this community service hearing
test possible.

The Hearing and Speech So-
ciety, a United Fund-Commun-
ity Chest Agency, is located at
313 Sixth Ave., downtown, with
David H. Tornblom as executive

director.

Draft Controversy Continues

 

Safety from Draft

 

     1...;

Corps Seeks Deferments

The Peace Corps has an-
nounced it will intervene on
behalf of volunteers seeking
draft deferments for two
years of overseas service.

Agency Director Jack
Vaughn, concerned by mount-
ing induction calls to volun-
teers serving overseas, said
he will take an “active role” in
seeking future deferment cases
before the Prevsident.ia.~l Appeal
Board-Athe court of last resort
for draft reclassiﬁoations.

In the past the agency per-
formed a largely informational
function —— advising volunteers
and trainees of Selective Service
laws and procedure confirming
to local boards the fact of the
volunteer’s service.

In future appeals, Vaughn will
write letters to the board des-
cribing the circumstances in
each case and’ urging board
members to grant a deferment

until completion of the volun-
teer's overseas tour.

“We have a serious situation,”
he said. “The probvlerm of induc-
tion notices to overseas volun-
teers is becoming a major con-
cern for us. Pulling a volunteer
off a productive job at mid-to-ur
is unfair to the nation, the host
country, the Peace Corps and
the _ individual.”

Vaughn said Peace Oorps vol-
unteers have lost about 60 de-
ferment appeals before the :three-
man board in the last six and
one-half years. While adverse
rulings by the national board
have involved less than one-half
of one per cent of the estimated
15,000 draft-eligible men who
have served in the Peace Corps,
“virtually all of these have oc-
cured in the past year,” he said.

Of the approximately 25 vol-
unteers who have already re-
turned to the United States for
draft induction, two were dis-
qualiﬁed fo-r physical reasons

Hershey Asks Deferment Loss

by WALTER GRANT

WASHINGTON (CPS) -
Selective Service Director
Lewis B. Hershey is recom-
mending that President John-
son issue an executive order
making it standard proce-
dure for disruptive anti-war
prote-stors to lose their draft
deferments.

Although the. proposed
executiveorder has not been
made public, its intent re-
portedly is to “tighten up” sec-
tions of the draft law which out-
line when a Selective Service
registrant should be declared a
“delinquent.” Delinquents are
reclassified and placed first in
the order of call.

The proposal follows a letter
which Hershey sent to local
draft boards in late October rec-
ommending that those who block
entrances to army induction cen-
ters or obstruct military recruit-
ment on campuses be drafted
first. If the executive order is
signed by the President, this
plan, which now is only a sug-
gestion by Hershey to local
boards, will be clearly spelled
out as standard procedure.

An official at Selective Service
headquarters said the Hershey
proposal has been turned over
to the Bureau of the Budget!‘
where all proposed executive or-
ders are initially sent—and is
now in the processing Stages-
The proposal is now being 1'9‘

viewed by the Department of
Justice prior to being sent to the
White House, he said.

The Justice Deparmtent could
quickly end consideration of the
proposal by declaring it uncon-
stitutional. Since Hersh-ey’s let-
ter to draft boards has been
made public, there have been
numerous charges that reclass-
ifying protestors is a violatio-n
of the First Amendment to the
Constitution.

A Selective Service spokesman
said, “This office has received
no formal notice from the At-
torney General that this docu-
ment (the letter) is unconstitu-
tional. Unless we receive such
a notice from the Justice Depart‘
ment, will have no further com-
ment,”

Hershey said his letter to lo-
cal boards contains no new P011"
cies, but is rather a recommen-
dation that the present draft
law be strictly enforced. The
relevant section of the Selective
Service .Act .says .th0Se .Wh0
“knowingly hinder or interfere
or attempt to do so in any Way
by force or violence or other-
wise” with the Selective service

system should be declared delin-
quents and face penalities or
reclassification. The proposed
executive order presumably
would explain this section of the
law in more specific terms and
order local draft boards to de-
clare registrants delinquent ac-
cordingly.

Hershey emphasizes that the
existing draft law says defer-
ments should be given only to
individuals who are acting in
the national interest. He says
those who interfere with mili-
tary recruitment are not acting
in the national interest.

The Selective Service direc-
tor’s views have been sharply
criticized by scores of college
newspapers, clergymen, several
Congressmen, and nUm€F0US 01"‘
ganizations, including the Amer-
ican Association of University
Professors‘ and the American
Civil Liberties Union. The Wash-
ington Post suggested in a re‘
cent -editorial that Hershey
should retire.

The fate of Hershey’s pro
posed executive order may We“
be determined by What the J“S'

and returned to their overseas 

assignments.

The vast majority of Peace”-b

Corps volunteers are granted de-
ferments for «two years of over-

seas «service is deemed by their -

local boards to be “in the na-
tional interest,” as rec~ommend-
ed by Lt. Gen. Lewis B. Hershey,
the draft dirrector.

However, some local Selective
Service boards refuse defer-
ments even though Peace Corps
service does not relieve VlOlll1Il
teers of etheir draft obligialti-ons.
If the local board is upheld by
the State Appeal Board, the
case may reach the Presidential

Board. which makes the  de-

cision.

The appeal process often takes
months to be resolved and the
Peace Corps frequently sends
volunteers to their overseas 
while their appeals for defer-
ment are pending.

Vaughn said the Peace Oorps,

-having peroviided upwards of 400 _ I

hours . of
training during the 12 to 14
weeks of preparation, often
sends volunteers overseas to be-
gin service “rather than risks
the loss of their newly-earned
language ﬂuency Iduning the
long waits for ﬁnal approval or

disazppiroval onf defereimenrt re~- . A7‘

quests.”

Vaughn said, ‘lSo long as the
chances for deferment are good
this systeim makes sense, but as
m-o-re and more volunrteens lose
their appeals We may have to
reconsider the process and keep
them, a vvla'stin*g asset, in the
United States until their cases
are resolved.”

He also said induction calls I

for volunteers overseas “dis-
rupts the continuity of carefully
planned projects ’by host coun-
try governments who also ‘have
invested a large amount of time
and money in the program”

Vaughn also noted that in a
number of cases, host country
governments have been unalble
-to replace drafted volunteer
teachers.

C -- Philosophy

THE NEXT TIME you
walk into a Philosophy class,
don’t. Don’t what. Don’t lis-
ten. For, if you do, you have
taken the ﬁrst step to becom-
ing a murder. Seriously.

A couple of days ago I was
starting to write a paper for
Political Science 118 —— Na-
tionalism. One of my friends
in the class asked me what
 was going to write about.
I said, “I don’t really kn-ow,
it’ll be about ten pages of
BS.

“But that’s not true,” she
said, “you usually write a
_ lot of good things in your
papers!”

AND THAT’S exactly why
its BS.

Looking back on all the
things that man has written
over his 20,000 year sp-an of
literacy, the best of it has
been called Philosophy. I
wouldn’t flatter myself into
calling what I write philoso-

‘phy, but to the extent that

I am living in and have ab-

sored the morays of our cul-

ture, it is certainly a reﬂec-
r tion of somebody’s philoso-
-,ph.V-

And what difference does

, this make? What is philo-

. sophy, what does somebody’s
madulin Wanderings through
obsure and ridiculous spec-
ulative puzzles have to do
with me, or with you?

SIMPLE — it makes us
into murderers.

Man is a creature of iden-
tity. He is born, he begins
to grow. His life is a wash
in the sentiments, the be-
liefs, the values of his par-

, V ents and his culture. Fo-r us,
 God, apple pie, and pro foot-
, ball are good. Nikita Khrus- _
-.”"‘,"""'chev, LSD, and cock ﬁght-
 ing is bad. Why? Because
lurking in and around every
idea you and I have is an
ideologue that some people

Editorial: The Importance of Response

versity is at the halfway mark. Much has been accomplished. Much re-
mains to be done. The prospects for achievement are bright.” Unfortun-
ately, that last sentence no longer is applicable. The prospects for achieve-
ment are far from bright. The potential is there, but it cannot be devel-

The response to our plea to register protest against the State Leg-
_ islature’s failure to appropriate funds to our University has been good, but
7not good enough. As of Monday evening, we had over 1,000 completed
 forms; we need a few thousand more to reinforce our case before we mail
)3’ the forms to the Governor at the end of this week.
I Why are we so intent on an overwhelming response? Obviously,
I our cause is much stronger if we have maximum support from the mem-
 bers of the student body. However, there is another reason why partici-
. pation is so important in this case. We are dealing with a situation that
I concerns all of us. The ﬁnancial implications of the Legislature’s failure
to act cannot be sufficiently stressed. There is an ever-present threat of
a tuition hike unless the Legislature is able to reach an agreement on the
P proposed taxes now up for consideration. As we have stated repeatedly,
unless there is sufficient money in the State Treasury to give the three ‘
S state-related institutions their allotted funds, there is a real possibility
that tuition will be raised starting in Sepember, 1968.
‘Our ﬁnancial instability is the very root of our problem, for unless
this University can once more be on a sound, ﬁnancial footing, how can
we ever get beyond the mundance and strive toward attaining the intan-
,,__.gibles that comprise a quality institution?
The entire concept of this University is at stake. As former Chan-
cellor Litehfield stated in his inaugural address ten years ago, “The Uni-

sopher. And they’re not bad
at it-—that’s the point. They
‘make what they say sound
very true. They take on the
established philosophy and
build on it, a little at a time.
Soon anything can be be-
lieved. God created us in sev-
en days, .the Pope is infalli-
ble, religion is a tool of the
upper class, if you eat beef,
you’re probably eating your
great-grandfather.

Sound ridiculous? Of
course. But, then again, may-
be not. You probably believe
at least some of those things.
And if pressed, you shall be
able to ﬁnd more than enough
philosophical justiﬁcation for
what you believe. Do you
think that the Catholic
has the right to choose what
you read, what you watch at
the movies, what you think?
Read Thomas Aquinas or
any of a dozen or more true
geniuses who have proven
this beyond any shadow of
a doubt. The pure beauty,
the elegance_, the overpower-
ing force of their arguments
have never really been des-
troyed, once their premises
are accepted.

DO YOU WANT to prove
that m a n is inherently
evil? Read Hobbes or any
number o-f early Protestant
theologians. They developed
their arguments, their logic
is impeccable, their style im-
pressive. Its all BS.

Why? Because all of these
things are true only to the
extent that you are brought
up in the culture or ideolog-
ical surroundings of these
philosophers. Nothing is
true,, things just sound true.

Real truth is just coinci-
dence. The world is con-
structed of ‘vapor. To the
Christian, Christ's divinity
is so obvious that the only
question is, how could it be
different? The Communist is

and ideas now in planning stages.

If our attention must be continually centered on Harrisburg while
our elected state officials remain undecided about whether we’ll receive
our funds, we will not progress from that halfway mark. Our preoccupa-
tion with our ﬁnancial status precludes any real kind of achievement in
other areas. We just cannot afford to think about anything else at this

_, We stated previously that over 1,000 students have responded to
our request to register our protest with the State Legislat-or’s failure to
act. We are running the form again in today’s paper, hoping that more

students will realize what is at stake: not only their tuition rate, bu.t the

entire concept of education at this University. It takes but a few seconds
to ﬁll out the form, but in the act of doing so, students can clearly show
their dissatisfaction with our failure to receive our allotted funds.

Legislators have informed us that they have received little response

First Step to Murder?

by Hobart Harris

sure, he really is, that the
world is as Marx saw it. And,
to the Moslem, there is not
a shadow of a doubt that if
he dies defending the faith
against inﬁdels, he will go t

Heaven gratis. ’

AND HOW hard does our
friend the Moslem ﬁght?
Well, it just may be a good
deal dependent upon how
persuasive his ideological un-
derpinnings are. For the
more we believe in some-
thing, the more likely we are
to ﬁght for it. And, with no
lack of qualiﬁed philosophers
to ﬁll the breaches, we have
fought for many things over
our 20,000 years. Peace is
dependent upon "believing
nothing at all. Say yes to
somebody’s idea and you’ve
taken the ﬁrst step to mur-
der.

And its BS. The Crusader
was told he was ﬁghting for
God, for Jesus Christ, and so
he proceeded to litter the
Holy Land with the stinking
offal of his victim. Women
were raped, children killed,
men tortured, all in the name
of a man who once called for
peace and brotherhood. And,
yet, somehow, it was turn-
ed into BS and used to kill,
just like everyone else has.
The more you believe in
something, the more ready
you are to kill for it.

All over the world, men
are killing each other, each
with the sure knowledge that
it is he that is ﬁghting for
truth and justice. Where will
it all end? When will there
suddenly be something too
good to kill for? When will
there ever appear a philoso-
pher whose _words cannot be
translated into murder?
When will there appear a
prophet who is not a mar-
tyr, when will there be an ex-
communication for defend-
ing the faith, rather than
denying it?

LOOK AROUND you,
somewhere in a volume of
Thomas Paine or Thomas
Locke or Stokely Charmich-
ael -or the Bible is something
so persuasive, so close to
your own beliefs, and so well
stated that you will kill for
that idea. That's BS.

Arm Band Letter

Editor, The Pitt News:

I should like to take excep-
tion to Michael Bennett’s letter
of Nov. 29, in which he un-
equivocally condemned those
students who are concerned
enough about peace to attire
themselves in white arm linen.
Besides being a collection of
timssnravsn xlishss 229 mass:
tionable generalizations, Mr. Ben-
nett’s letter is a superb exam-
ple o-f factual inconsistency and
non-logic. Who but a person of
Mr. Bennet~t’s obvious fascist
leanings could conclude that,
simply because the US record
in Latin American is untained
by capitalist exploitation, it will
be so Vietnam?

Many years ago, a world-re-
knowned carpenter and part-
time social worker stated that
“a house divided against itself
will -not stand.” Be-fore he ereots
a monument to right-Wing na-

tional egocentricity, therefore, I‘
.would advise Mlr.

Bennett to
check his foundation for leaks
and ﬁssures. While the national
record Mr. Bennett alludes to is
indeed impressive, it deserves to
be pointed out that an equally
impressive coroll-ary of US for-
eign policy has been, more of-
ten than not, a digniﬁed re-
straint in international dealings.

How could Mr. Bennett over-
look the powerful displa.y of
American neutrality in Europe
and Asia, before the veste-d in-
terests and industrial complex

from their constituents. Let us not echo that apathetic performance; let
show that we are concernedabout the fate of our University.

the Editor

sucked her into WW I and II at
the last m'inu=t~e? Who could fail
to recall, without a wistful smile
and a tear-ﬁlled eye, that Week
in Nov. 11 years ago when “self-
determ'in'is.m” prevailed over “an-
-ti-communism,” and Hungary
was left to determine her own
national fate free of imperialist
intervention, despite the muffled
outcries of a few Hungarian ex-
tremists for outside help. It is
true, Mr. Bennett, that the Unit-
eg §tates d_id meddle _in the eco-
homieltajﬁzililig 5'f‘3‘Z{ll§11"adl§“\Wf’é’si=
ern Europe after World War II
at the behest of the American
uindustcrialists, but that error was
more attoned by our steadfast
neutrality in regard to the East
European nations.

It was noted in Mr. Bennettﬂs
letter that the Vietnamese peas-
ants are a well-read, ideological
group of individuals, who real-

Illllllllllllllll

ize th:at an underdeveloped agri- ’

cultural nation such as theirs
would be much more likely to
prosper under capitalism. It is
fo-r precisely ‘this reason that
communism, and the accom-
panying terrorism of its adher-
ents, pose no threat whatsoever

to the irrhabiitlants of Vietnam.

This being the case, the US
should take a lesson from those

, periods in its history when neu-

trality was maintained, and re-
move all forces from Vietnam
immediately. Mr. Bennet does a
great disservice to those Who, by
sporting armbands above the
left elbow, would express their
agreement with this viewpoint.

Timelessness of Art

The following three stories-

and ideas that once took years
or millennium now are born,

Nowhere is the effect of this
trend more evident than in the
arts, which are essentially forms

ble to its laws as the telephone.
Often the elegance and comtem-
plation of mature art forms are
lost in the need to create some-
thing new. The dangers of “pop”
are as real as the challenges.

New Politics Emerges From
Disappointments of The Old

by IVAN ABRAMS

Members of Congress have re-
cently called for an investiga-
tion of the National Conference
on New Politics. This, more
than any other event, is a sign
that politics in the United States
are entering a period of transi-
tion. To be sure bastions of the
old machine-dominated party
system remain; among the most
notable of these are Pittsburgh’s
own Mayor Joseph Barr, Con-
gressman Joe Pool of Texas,
and President L. B. Johnson.

But for many Americans, the
political establishment has be-
come a symbol of frustration
and misrepresentation that must
be abolished. Thus, the “new
politics” pose a deﬁnite thre-at
to the ruling hierarchy and the
desire to investigate arises from
a growing fear that the new
ventures will succeed.

American politics began to
change during the 1960 presi-
dential campaign, when, for the
ﬁrst time, Negro and poverty-
stricken voters were openly
courted by the Democra»tic‘ma-
chine. Indeed, a vital plank of
the Democratic platform was
the establishment of an attack
on American social ills, intend-
ed precisely to woo a previous-
ly disenfranchised or disinter-
ested segment of «the electorate.

Lyndon Johnson, however,
proved himself to be a man not
to be taken seriously. Months
after promising “we won’t send
American boys 10,000 miles from

' home to do what Vietnamese

boys must do for themselves,”
the first of the massive war es-
calations began. Soon after, the
“War on Poverty” was cut back
to a mere trickle, an-d integra-
tion, rather than become accept
ed, turned out to be a farce.
Johnson's promises were hollow
and the people of -the United
States knew it.

And the people made their
disgust known. Negroes began
-to revolt in the urban ghettos.
realizing that if any social re-
forms was to occur it would
have to be a grass roots move-
ment. Intellectuals came out
against Johnson and his Viet-
nam war, barely a year after
campaigning for his election.
Labor refused to heed the wheed-
ling of the adminisutrartion and
struck. For those Americans
who had thought they saw a
new hope in the system of ma-
chine politics, that hope was
destroyed by the end of 1965.

By 1966, groups such as the
Mississippi Freedom Democrtic
Barty, organized to allow Missis-
sippi Negroes to be able to vote
for candidates representative of
their needs, the Black Panther
group in Georgia, and spl-inter

groups of establishment parties

in the North had begun to ap-
pear, all with the '-hope of pro
viding the truly representative
government that was lacking in
America. More and more liber-
al members of the po1itical,es-
tablishment deserted from the
party ranks, forming groups
such as the Democratic Clubs of
California, pushing for social re-
form, an end to the war in Viet-
nam, and above all opposed to
L. B. Johnson.

Also at this time, the Peace
Movement began to grow from
an essentially tight group of
radicals to a broad based mass
movement, involving a large per-
centage of Americans. By April,
1967, the movement was so large
that 250,000 people could gather
in New York and demand an
end to the. war in Vietnam.

Naturally, with the Adminis-
tration adamant about its War

. policy, the members of the peace

movement, hoping to end the
war politically, if they could not
do so by protest, began to be-

come invoved in either the then-
existing neo-po-litical groups or
to form new ones of their own.
The war was the central issue
for most of these groups, but
there seemed to be an underly-
ing consensus that the wlar Was
but a symnprtom of a great so-\
cietal ill. For -some, th-is ill could
be eradicated through electoral
means. For others, American so
ciety was so sick that only full-
scale revolution could alleviate
any problems.

This is essentially where the
“new politics” stands. today. And
thus today, we ﬁnd groups in
one area organizing for rebel-
lion in the cities, while at the
same time other groups content
themselves with electoral games
_.piaying with the powers that
be. At the same time, the estab
lishment has been offering up
tokens to the people; a Negro
mayor here, a Senate debate
there, a rat control bill to keep
the people quiet.

It can be assumed that the
movement for a new politics will
continue to grow, and it is pos-
sible that electoral polit:i.cs may
fall by the wayside. Americans
involved in the new movement
are active precisely because they
have seen their country’s be-
trayal by a group -of promise-
making politicians; they are ex-
tremely wary of a repeat of
that betrayal. Thus, it is con-
ceivable that urban rebellion
will continue to mount. Dis~satis- .
faction in the United States ap
pears to be more prevalent -than
the admi-nisitration wishes to ad-
mit, and if this is the case, then
“new politics” may shift from
its transitional stage to- one of
solid-iﬁcaition as its policies gain
support. Right now it’s too’ea»r-
ly to make any predictions, but
it's certain that the next ﬁve
-or ten years will be critical in
formulating the future of Amer-
ican society.

,- by FRANK -COUVARES

Folk music in America has
been coming to terms with
itself in the last few years.
Folksingers have had to ask
themselves the question,
what is folk music? and,
what is the stuff I am sin-ging?

For some, the honest (answer-s
to these questions «have resulted
-in the trans-ferrin-g -of their tal-
ents to the ﬁeld of rock ‘n’ roll.
Many of these, like Bob Dylan,
Jesse Colin Young, -and Peter,
Paul, and Ma-ry are now per-
forming the new rock musi.c al-
most exclusively and have clear-
ly admitted that, alt-hou-g1h -they

' learned a great deal from their

ﬂirtation with folk music, they
-are not folk singers.

They have forsaken the sim-
mediacy and simplicity of folk
music for the :sop:hi-sticativon and
currency of electronic urock mu-
sic. They have admitted that the
only connection between folk
music and their music is a deriv-
-tative one; e.g., they use bl-ues
ﬁgures and rhylthms, but vwitnin
a musical framework that is
radically different. And for them,

- I think, the switch was a wise

and generally successful one.
Others have continued to work

in the folk idiom Dave Van

Ronk remains one of the finest
purveyors of -blues, growing and
maturing, and expanding his
competence in the various kinds

, of southeastern American blues

forms. Pete, Seeger, whose mu-

sic is more heavily inﬂuenced
by the British folk and ballad
tradition of American folk mu-
sic is more heavily influenced
mains the greatest artist of his
kind in :America today.

Both men are folk singers,
and neither has any doubt about
what that means. Though very
different kinds of artists, they
are both committed to the kind
of direct and individual com-
munictaion of human emotional
experience that is the essence of
folk music.

When the Oarnegie Ceilidh
brought three British folk sing-
ers to Pittsburgh on Saturday,
Nov. 18, is provided a good op-
portunity for us «to hear real
folk music and to help us un-
derstand the changes in contem-
porary folk music.

The three singers, Norman
Kennedy of Scotland, Maggi
Pierce-Kerr of Nothern Ireland,
and Lou Killen of England, gave
an extraordinary concert. The
most startling observation to be
made is that they are not “per-
formers.” For them, obviously,
Singing is a. part -of living.‘ They
sing‘, almost un-selfconsciously,
about the genuine human emo-
tional events which all men, in
common, can potentially experi-
ence. Their means are unaffect-
ed and “unsophisticated” in that
they rely on traditional forms,
familiar rhythms and melodic
figures, and colloquial language.

There is something about the .

unaccomopanried singing of Nor-

I   Folk Music Sees New Forms

man Kennedy, the Scottish weav-
er, that rings true; the accuracy
and intensenses with which he
relates those simple, “every
day,” and eminently “human”
experiences elicits our immedi-
ate assent, as, for instance, in
the beautiful ballad, "‘I’1l lay
you down, love, I’ll treat you de-
cent.”'In -this, there is no place
for an “audience.”

And, if, as our text books
tells us, art is “the -tangible ex-
pression of human experience,”
then these folk songs are art in
its purest form.

This -seems to be what Ameri-
can folk singers are trying to
do. There are some, however,
who have also made the deci-
sion to work in the folk idiom,
but who seem to be suspended
in that never-never land be-
tween art and entertainment.

Joan Baez, who performed in
Pittsburgh on the night before

the Ceilich concert, is one of-

them. She seems to be groping
for that kind of direct and gen-
uine expression that the British
singers exhibited. Sometimes
during her concert she succeed-
ed, e.g., in the ballad, “There but
for fortun-e," and in the blues
song, “Daddy, you been on my
mind.” But more oflten than not
she was unable to avoid that
crippling performer - audience
dichotomy.

In her pre-concert press con-
ference, Joan Baez conveyed the
kind of -h-umailzity and tenderness

that left those who had ‘inter-

as Media

viewed her with a feeling of
elation, of having really “cook-
ed” with another human being.
On stage, however, she could
only inftrequently ‘approximate
this kind of interpersonal com-
munication.

In contrast, the British sing-
ers, during a small party after
their concert, came accross in
exactly the same way as they
had on-stage. There was no ques-
tion of adjustment because they
make no artiﬁcial distinctions
between “performer” and “au-
dience” or between “a perform-
ancc” and just singing.

The kind of concert I have
been describing, wherein people
get down to interpersonal com-
munication by means o-f the
common denominator of gen-
uine human emotion, is that the
ceilidh is, or in America, what
the sing-out or hootenany is sup-
posed to be. 1

Those folk -singers who real-
ly “make it” engender this kind
o-f atmosphere. The British sing-
ers do it all the time, as does
Pete Seeger. Those who were
seeking another kind of expres-
sion (perhaps a more intellec-
tual one, in some cases, or a
more popular one, in others)
have utilized rock ‘n’ roll music
as their modus operandi. I

The best of them have found
3 C0mm0n meeting ground with
the Beatles. Instead of reject-
ing the complexity of modern
technology and its deemphasis
on human 9 contact, they - have

   

Changes

decided to capitalize upon its
advantages: the ability to com-
municate on a massive scale; the
appeal of newness, the excite-
ment of electronic sounds; the
complex comb-inations and jux-
tapositions of sounds and medi-
ums.

The affinities among songs like
Dyl-an’s “Visions of Johanna,”
the Beatles’ “A Dal in the Life,”
and Donvan’s “Sunshine Super-
man,” are evident They all util-
ize exci-ting electronic rock
sounds that pound at our senses
and within which appears ‘a kind
of poetry that i.s heavy with
images and that demands a
great deal of intellectual atten-
tiveness.

That they are not folk sing-
ers hardly has to be said. The
term “folk rock” -is unfortunate
because it implies -that these
songs are merely the old stuff of
folk music set to electronic in-
strumen-tation. But the spuri-
ousness of this implication is
clearly seen in the utter failure
of those songs which have at-
tempted merely to “dress-up” old
folk songs in rock attire (sore
of like trying to orchestrate a
Renaissance court dance for a
modern hundred piece orchestra.

The new rock music has been
successful only when it has been
original and clearly dissociated
from folk music. It cannot be
considered an improvement on,

D

. or even merely an extension of,

folk music.

tice Department decides. The De-
partment ruled on a similar
question in January, 1966.

At that time, Assi.stant At-
torney General Fred M. Vinson,
Jr. said that “as a matter of
both law and policy, sanctions
of the Universal Military Train-
ing and Service Act cannot be
used in any way to stifle con-
sion of views.” He said reclass-
iﬁcation by the Selective Service
System could not be usedagainst
demonstrators “where the con-
perative that the public debate
be full.”

duct involved is the expression
of an opinion, even if the meth-
od of expression transgresses
the law. If there is no trans-
gression, then no sanction can
be invoked. If there is a trans-
gression, then the sanctions
which attach to it are all that

' should be applied.”

Vinson’s opinion was handed
down after several draft boards
attempted to reclassify Univers-
ity of Michigan students who
staged a sit-in at the Ann Arbor
draft office. The aCti0I1 by the
draft boards was also ruled il-

legal by the U. S. Court of Ap-
peals for the Second Circuit.
The judges held in a unanimous
opinion that “it is not the func-
tion of local boards in the Selec-
tive Service System to punish
registrants by reclassifying them
1-A because they protested as
they did over the Government’s
involvement in Vietnam.”

The Court also held that “it

is the free expression of views
on issues of critical current na-

tional importance that is jeopard-

ized.

Cagers Hope to Bowl Over M

Holiday Action Figures

by JAY ROSENSTEIN
Sports Editor

If there were any gam-
blers on the campus (heaven
says there aren’t), and if
they ever -decide to bet against
the Pitt basketball team (heav-
en knows they never do), they
would follow at least the next
ﬁve Pranther games very closely.

schedule. Game time will be 7
p.m., with Duquesne battling
Air Force in the second contest
of the double header.

Incidentally, Pitt always plays
in the first game of Steel Bowl
Tournament-s, simply because
few fans would be left in the
Arena to see the second game
if Duquesne competed in the
opener. —

KEN BOLLENS, a two-year ‘.letterma.n ‘is one of only two seniors

last year.

by MIKE BROURMAN
Jimmy celebrated his sixth birth-

, day, conﬁned to the wheelchair that

has accompanied him since birth.

His parents still treasure yester-
day's celebration, for they know
that unless a cure for cancer is
found soon, Jimmy will probably not
live to blow out seven candles next
year. ' . ,

Among the agencies which are
attempting to combat such crippling
and killing diseases is the Pitts-
burgh Post-Gazette’s Dapper Dan
Charities. As one of their fund rais-
ing activities, they will sponsor Fri-
day night's Steel Bowl.

Last year the Steel Bowl turn-
ed over a fairly large sum to charity.
But, the amount would have been
even larger except for the actions of
some of the Ushers at the Civic

them than that. They won’t have
to worry about the pnime ne-
mesis of visiting teams, the
home court advantage. The fer-
vor of Pitt basketball fans is
legendary, and the huge num-
ber of them that turns out for
the Steel Bowl each year is also
nationally acclaimed.

If -the Panthers can get by
Massachusetts, they’ll probably
face Duquesne in the champion-
=ship. The Dukes appear «to have
an NIT team this year, due
chieﬂy to the return of 6-8 cen-
ter Rh-il Washinsgton, wtho =is
once again ac-ademuically eligible.

More feared than .-’VVa.shington,
however, is the spirit of the Du-
quesne crowd. The Panthers
would be a visiting team in their
own city if they met Duquesne.

Temple has the honor of play-
-ing /in the .true home opener,
D-ec. 22, at the Field House. The
Owls have back four of the ﬁve
starters who crushed the Pan-
thers last year. _

After -the break for Chnistmtas
and New Years, the eagers trav-
el to William & Mary and Mi-
ami. The Colonials ﬁgure to be
rough, especially at home. They
over came a 17 point deﬁcit to
nip the Panthers here -last year,
72-68.

The Hurricanes haven’t scared
anyone since the days of Rick
Barry, but .they’ll probably Iscare
Pitt. The Panther sophomores,
who were tight in the »loss to
Rutgers over the weekend, will

MIKE PATCHER scores against Duquesne in his freshman season.

[In his ﬁrst varsity game against Rutgers, he led the cagers with

22 ;points. Patcher, from izlohnstown, Pa., stands at 6-5, and will
start in the Steel Bowl,

have to loosen up if the cagers
hope to win any of the ﬁve
games.

Coach Bob Timmons thinks
they will. He has credited open-
in-g game jirtters and the full
house in New Brunsvwieh for
the lopsided loss to Rultgers.
“We had the open short but
couldn’t hit it,” he lamented.
“After the ﬁrst ten minutes,
they got hot, picked up a lot of
momentum from ‘the crowd, and
opened up a lead.

“Then we had to go out aﬁter
them,” 'Dim.mons exxpslrained. “But
they found'the open shot and
made it.” 'llimmonus expects all
ﬁve opponents to use pressure
defenses against his club, es-
pecially when his sophaomores
are in the game.

Against Rutgers, Rob -'McFar-

land was tight and «it affected his
shooting (1-11). So Timmons

plans to start Charley Hunt at
center and move Mike Patcher
back to ‘forward. By not starting
McFarland Timmons explained,
“He might be loser and he could
really help us coming off the
bench.”

What wo-ulld retailly help Mc-
Farland, Hunlt, P-atcher, a-nd Bob
Petrini would be a few people
in the stands to cheer, or even
boo. Bausketballl -players have fi-
nals too.

PITT NEWS EXCLUSIVE

Arena who have chosen to make a
crooked buck [out of it.

Operating at the Bedford Ave. en-
trance to the Arena (and possibly
at some of the others) these men
supplemented their pay by “selling”
general admission “tickets” the pub-
1c.

The modus operandi is not very
complicated. One usher stationed in-
side the Arena to collect tickets
merely pockets the stubs rather
than putting them in the collection
box.

He then gives the stubs to an-
other usher who stands outside and
“sells” the stubs to people, passing
them off as general admission tick-
ets. 6

When the unwitting, or in some
cases knowning, victims get inside,
the other usher. collects the . stubs

   

again and lets "them enter. “But,
don’t turn the turnstile,” they are
told. “It’s broken. Just slide through
sideways.” .

’ The result of all of this is obvi-
ous. There is no telling how many
people may enter the Arena 0-n only
one general admission ticket.

When the ushers are ﬁnally done,
they deposit the stubs in the collec-
tion box. Thus, the turnstile has
been turned only once for each tick-
et. The charity gets the price of
that one admission, and the ushers
pocket the rest of the money.

Bedford Ave. is a proﬁtable area
for this illegal enterprise because,
although it is none of the main gates
at the Arena, tickets are not nor-
mally sold there.

People who arrive there without
tickets will usually be more than

willing to buy them fromsa friendly

-Steel Bowl Loses to Crooked Ushers

usher rather than walking all the
way to the ticket office for them.

Since the double sale of reserved
seat is impossible, only general ad-
mission tickets are part of the
scheme. They have no seat numbers.
All a general admission customer
expects from his purchase is the
chance to scramble for a seat. ‘

The practice is not conﬁned to
charity affairs alone. It is also com-
monplace at other Arena affairs.
But, it is at charity events where: it
is the most cruel.

Certainly, the amount of money
these ushers collect from their
crooked scheme will not alone pay
for a cure for cancer. But, multiply
it by the number of times and
places where it happens. It all adds
up.

It might be enough to save Jim-
my’s life. i

from last sea.son’s disappointing
7-15 squad. Moe Barr, the lead-
ing sscorer last season, teams
with Zopf in the backcourt,
while 6-6 Ron Zuziak and 6-8
Gary Major return at forward.
Phil Washington resumes the
center spot he manned two years
ago, after a year‘ of ineligibility.

'I‘he Duke’:s strong point is
their experience, but their out-

sideraibly last Week when Bill

quently had a hot hand last

else. Parsons, who did not play

and he himself gives the Air
Force an excellent chance in the
Steel Bowl.

Masacihusetts oﬁers the Pan-
th~er"cag-ers some stiff competi-
tion ‘in the opening round. The
representative from the Yankee
Conference are boosting 6-5 for-
ward Billy Tindall for A.ll-Amer-
zican honors. Last season he was
named to the All-Yankee Con-
ference and All-New Englan
post season squads. -

The rest of the Massachusetts
squad is a mixture of middle-
sized, young b-all players with
the exception of 5-11 playmaker
J oe z-DiFanein-g. Three sopha:
mores could start. The squad
shapes up similarly to the Pan-
thers, which should make the

‘first round interesting.

In Quest 0 ond Victory

by ART ROSENGARTEN
Coming off an impressive
opening victory over Indi-

ana State, the swimmers will 
face a strong West Virginia team 
Saturday afternoon in quest of '1

a second straight victory.

 

Coach Bill Grant will bring  I T

his -squad of nine swimmers and
two divers u:p agiainst a team
that ourtn-umbers it almost two
to one. West Virginia's squad
also lirncludes freshmen due to a
new Southern‘ Conference rul-
ing. Tlhis’ will help give the
Mountaineers a decisive deptlh
advantage over the swimmers.

“I don't know too much about
West Virginia as a team,” said
Grant, “but I have been told
that they are ‘tough in the re-
layls and have -pretty good bal-
ance.

-Grant feels that the swim-
mers can gain the 57 points ne-
cessary to win the meet. “I feel
that we control about 50 some
points, but it is up to the num-
ber two men to capture those all
important second and third
paces to garner the rest of the
points needed for victory,” he
explained.

'Ilhe swim.mer’«s number two
men -performed very well against

Indliana State. According to.

Grant, “We have to keep up the

.-said Grant. Even though he was
still "weak from the illness, he
swam the individual medley for
the first time ever in competi-
tion Saturday. ‘‘I am confident
that Paul will come along as
soon as he feels better," voiced
Grr-ant.

“Ken Golden.berg did a fairly
credible job for this time of the
year in the 200-yard freestyle,
and did a much better job in
the 500-yard freestyle than I ex-
pected him to do,” Grant men-
tioned. Goldenberg also swam a
leg on the 400-yard freestyle re-
lay with only ﬁve minutes rest
between events. “He kept on
pushing all the way,” said

‘ Grant.

Number -two diver Chester Zein-
tek also received praise [for his
performance. “'Ilh:i»s was Chest-
er’s ﬁrst time diving in actual
competition,” Grant explained.
“He gave their number one man

team prepares for its next three meets. They play Slippery

Rock tonight at the Rockets’
gym. The gymnasts will then
be home against Army and Sy-
racuse.

Slippery Rock was weakened
considerably on the side horse
by the loss of John Daller, “com-
mented N eiger.” Daller was their
all-around man. If Mike lB~eatty
and Phil Lilly work this event
the way they did at Cornell last
Saturday, we should get a win
there.

“There strongest event is the
trampoline. They have T0m
Horn, who finished first on the
tramp against us last year. But
Tom Fisher is recovering nicely
from his foot injury and 1 F1099

to have him ready for this on-e.”

“Overall, Slippery Rock is like
Cornell,” he continued. “They
have the same strengths and
weaknesses, and I am confident
of a good showing.

The gymnasts will meet Army
at Trees Hall 2:00 p.m. Saturday.
“Army has a tough team,” Nei-
ger noted. Not too many of
their men performed in high.
school, but their
competition is tough.”

“They lost Tom. Di Nioicla on
the longhorse and Charles Beck-
with on the sidehorse, so I think
we have a good shot at them in
both those events.”

by ROY JACOBS
A couple of moderations and innovations to the wrest-
ling program were discussed by coach Dave Adams earlier
this week as he prepared his team for its ﬁrst dual meet,

this Saturday at St. Francis.

Adams announced a departure
from the practice of wrestle-offs
during the week to determine
who wrestles varsity.

“From now on, I'll probably
be picking the team that
wrestles on Saturday,” explain-
ed the coach. “I don't like to

- use wrestleoffs because after a

while the boys get to know each
other’s moves and they know
what to look for and guard
themselves for it. Then elimina-
tions become a farce.

“This way,” Adams continued,
“the boys know r11 be picking
the team, and they’ll have to
put out in practice.”

Assistant coach Bob Fehrs is
responsible for contributing the
takedown ‘proficiency innovation,
a complicated system of points
which is based on the high cor-
relation between a wrest1eI"S
won-lost record and his number
of takedowns.

The formula is fairly compli-
cated: take twice the number of
the varsity wrest1er’s number
of takedowns in a match and
add‘ to that the number of neu-
trals (periods ending with both
wrestlers on their feet). Then
subtract three times thenumber
of the opornents takedowns. This
total is divided by tW1<>e the
number of opportunities (num-
ber of varsity wrestlers take-
downs, plus opponents take-
downs, plus the number of Den.

6 traJs).

(ii

Dick Shildt was the va.rsity’s
only Quadrangular champion,
and it was reflected in his take-
down proficiency of .714. Bruce
Unangst, a second place finish-
er, posted a. .666. Overall, how-
ever, the varsity was what
Adams called a “poor .243.”

Ad-am’s bi.g1g~est«;p-roblem at the
moment ‘is depth. Dave J oxhn-
son, his only 145 epounder, is in-
jured -in-deﬁnritely. Ron Sohuch-
ert, at 137, is out until after
Christmas. And Jim Rhone (152)
is having ‘trouble making weight.
