From Ph\i“Sig

 

if By BERN] McLEOD

Adrienne Sanza, representing
Phi Sigma Sigma sorority, was
crowned 1966 Greek Week Queen
Wednesday night, at the close of
Greek Sing. Wearing a rose red

gown, she accepted her crown -

 d a dozen red roses from Jim

 Smith and Dyanne Hochman,

over-all Greek Week chairmen.
Working on a theme of “senior

blues,” Miss Sanza began her per- '

formance by entering from the
rear of Carnegie Music Hall au-
ditorium, passing out her‘ “call-
ing cards.” Once on stage, after
reminiscing about her college
days, she explained that such
cards were the only recourse for

an unmarried senior about to

'§1raduate.

J’

She invited the lucky ticket
holder to meet her after the
show."“I know mother wouldn’t
approve of this,” she remarked,
“but what else can a Operation
Match reject do?”

Contributing their share of the
program, 26 sororities and frater-
nities presented 26 varieties on the
theme’ of “That Wonderful Year.”
Among the outstanding fraternity
performances was Phi Epsilon Pi
who sang of the American herit-

ggage, typiﬁed by the cowboy bal-

lad and Negro spmitual. They
chose the year 1949 and the
songs, “Ghost Riders in the. Sky”
and “Lucky Old Sun.”

With the quick movements rem-
iniscent of the silent “flick” era,
Pi Lambda Phi entered to sing
a medley of 1925 tunes, “Heart of
My. Heart,” “Five Foot Two,”
and “Yes Sir That's My Baby.”
In straw hats and striped blazers,

, Pi Lam gave a remarkably well _

harmonized '6 and, ‘polished  per-
fo_mance‘.; 6,   .   ‘—

4 Sanza Greek Queen

sented a song of despair from
1960, entitled “Swing that Ham-
mer.” ‘On a darkened stage, in

1 both solo parts and group har-
T mony, Alpha Phi Alpha sang a

convincing tale of sorrow.
Among sororities, Kappa Alpha
Theta, singing “Wynken, Blynken
and Nod,” presented one ofthe
most charming songs of the eve-
ning. Dressed in night caps and
gowns, cuddling stuffed animals
of various types, the Theta’s gave
a well-directed presentation of an
appealing children.’7s rhyme.
I The carefuly staged perform-
ance by Kappa Kappa Gamma of
a Sound of Music medley, -was

one of the stand-out sorority per-
formances. The Kappa sisters,

dressed lik e y o u n g Austrian _

maidens, moved in precision to

'l-the music of “Do Re Me,” and

gave a» simple, well-performed,
rendition of “Climb Every Moun-
‘tain” and “The Sound of Music.”

Winners will be announced at
the Greek Week Concert.

Adequacy of ‘News’ Scored
  In Parliamentary Debate

The Pitt News was raked over
the proverbial coals at last Tues-
day’s parliamentary debate spon-
sored by the William Pitt Debate
Union. The topic of the debate
was “Resolved: The Pitt News
Has Not Fulﬁlled Its Function.”
The resolution passed, 24-11.

Speaking’ for the affirmative,
‘or, in parliamentary debate par-
lance, the “Government,” were
Tom Kane and Armand Belly.
Kane explained that the function
of a_ newspaper should be to
“print the news courageously and
impartially, and to serve the pub-
lic interest,” and that The Pitt
News has not fulfilled these func-
tions. He excoriated the News for
not addressing itself to the two
signiﬁcant contemporary revolu-

tions; the revolution of modern-’

ity and the revolution ‘of the
University. ' ~.
Closely associated with the rev-
olution of modernity Kane said
were the rise of liberalism, the
administration of President Ken-
nedy, Vietnam, the Peace Corps,
Berkeley, and ‘student involve-
ment in general. Kane explained
that there is a great deal of con-
fusion in this revolution and “this
is where the newspaper comes

in,” to provide “intelligent edi-

torial comment, to interpret and
to analyze. But where is The Pitt
News?”

Belly continued the indictment
with further examples of what
the “Government” considered to
be signiﬁcant discrepancies in
noteworthy news items and rele-
vant editorial_ comment. He parti-
cularly chided the News for not
commenting editorially ,on the
appearances on campus of Hans
Morgenthau, Robert Elegant, and
Nicholas Katzenbach. »

Opposition speakers were Mah-
mood Mamdani and William Cab-
in. Cabin, editor of The ‘Pitt News,
listed the physical resource limit-
ations which should be consider-
ed. He stated that service” on The
Pitt. News _is., C’

example, where the editor is re-
leased from school obligations for
a year and receives a large sal-
ary.

Cabin also emphasized that
prior training is not a grequisite
nor is there ‘a journalism course

reporters. He said that “fulﬁll-
ment of the functions of a cam-
pus newspaper are a matter of
perception. They can -never be
fulﬁlled or realized as long as
people continue to view it from
the point of their petty vested
interests.”

Mamdani chastized the “starry-
eye liberals” and the “ﬂaming
conservatives” in‘ the audience
for expecting the News to appeal
mainly tothe intellectuals since
“the intellectuals are a very
small group on campus.” He went
on, contending that the News
was first to emphasize the Viet-
nam question, whereupon. stu-
, dent demonstrations, the Students
for Peace and signiﬁcant student
interest followed. n

Mamdani also stated that it
was The Pitt News that urged
students “to do something” about

it affected them, and that it was
‘The Pitt News that came -out
against the new donn payment
r rules andurged/students-“to do
something about it.”

p A patch of blue came/ into the
life of Mr. Charles Dillon Sten-
gel‘ one balmy August afternoon
two._.summers ago, in the person
lofia young boy who had never
seen a baseball game and who
never ‘ would. The hands of hiﬁ

Braille watch approached game

dugout the boy held the strict
attention of the 75-year-old.man-
ager of the New York Mets.

' .:l'he blind boy talked with Sten-
gel on their favorite subject —
baseball—and* Casey respectfully
‘bowed his head beneath a bar-
rage of statistics and advice on
how to run the lowly Mets and
each of. the club’s minor league
teams. Stengel sat silently, as
the boy who had never seen green
outﬁeld grass or played in a Lit-
tle League was weighing the ef-
fectiveness- (or ineptitude) of
each Met player. ’

’_ Having no visual acquaintance
with baseball, the boy's judg-
ments had to be based upon ob-
jective statistics alone. Near-wins
5: and almost-strikeouts — the us-
Hual ingredients in a Met fan’s
alibis — were conspicuously ab-
77>-sent from his statements. He
had never seen a game, but he
spoke eloquently of the team's
A . - performance.

 This rare gift of being able to

‘_‘sight._We are less careful in our
 judgment, and we hesitate to go

*-the people and situation we

prejudice, and its often impene-
trable cloud of superstition and
-misunderstanding makes it per-
haps the more unfortunate af-
ﬂiction.

 Now there is a ﬁlm dealing
with both kinds of blindness-

‘A "blind girl Selina triumps over
the short-sighted intolerance of

story of One Potato, Two Potato,

grandfather—a drunkard.

It is this contrast between the
delicacy and inner strength of
Gordon and Selina and the crude-
ness and weakness of the moth-
er and grandfather that gives the
cast the opportunity to lift their
roles beyond the simple situa-
tion we are given. None misses
that chance.

Editorial. A Necessary o my

, Acting Chancellor Dr. David4_Kurtzman’s restatement of University social policy
was a bold and necessary action (see story, page I). In the ﬂurry of ﬁnancial problems
'in_d‘;the state-relatedness issue, such policies have become repressed both in the minds of
the enforcers and observers.

0,  A University is supposedly designed to both disseminate and propogate knowledge
 to replace ignorance with intelligence. Prejudice should, therefore, be one practice it con-
tinually rebukes, especially in its own affairs.

' It would seem logical that since students are admitted without any bias because
of race, religion, or social affiliations that they would be treated likewise by the University
ipon graduation. An alumni group, regardless of its majority composition, bears the name
of the University. It should be sensitive to equal treatment of its fellow classmates.

 ’ Administrative groups operate likewise. There is some degree of heterogeneity,
"though the administrative group may be dominated by one socio-economic strata. We do
notobject to any person’s right to join a closed, private group, but we do object to their
‘carrying their closed-group prejudices under the University’s name.

._-lubs are as “beautiful as the Student Union ballroom,” there are few who could say there
?ire_insufi’icient hotel and dining halls for their functions. There are few who say the
price differential between private clubs and public facilities is great..

, It would seem there should be no oojections to the policy since it is designed ‘to
V uard against all forms of discrimination. Yet, there arethose in alumni and adminis
' trative circles who will probably take the restatement as a slap-in-the-face. -

-. We must say that we give our entire support to the policy and urge its‘ enforce-
ment. We must say that we are still living in a diverse University, community, and world
and thatthis ‘University can neither tolerate prejudice from outside nor within.

Tapping Revisited
by Bill Cabin

,_ In light of the many criticisms of tapping procedures
of University honoraries, I thought it my duty to devise a
new, fair, foolproof system for tapping. The objective of
the new system is to provide admission of all competently
qualified students on the basis of academic excellence and
leadership abilities.,...
_ The new system provides that members of a male hon-
orary serve as the selection committee for admission of new
members to a female honorary and vice versa. The male se-
lection ‘committee would receive a list of all objectively
qualified candidates and then subjectively discuss their
merits, tapping those best embodying the spirit of the hon-
orary.

/ LET US TAKE a hypothetical tapping situation under
the new tapping system. Delta Omega Gamma (DOG), a
women’s honorary, is selecting its new tappees with a com-
mittee of men from Nu Iota Chi Eta (NICE). DOG selects

.,/

" those girls who have attained a minimum quality point

average of 3.8, have 120 credits accumulated, and epitomize
the qualities of ugliness.
“Okay fellas, let’s be NICE guys and get this meet-

ing to order,” said the chairman. “Our ﬁrst nomi- I

nee is Miss Wallinda Wallinda. She meets all the

objective criteria. The floor is now open to sub-

jective discussion.” , .

Walter‘ Walter, a short, studious-looking youth with an
acute case of acne rose in behalf of Wallinda. “Speaking
from personal experience, I can honestly say Wallinda is
ugly. She was the ﬁrst girl to accept a date with me in two
years. She’s really great, fantastic, as far as ugliness goes.”

“I DON’T DOUBT the validity of Wa1ter’s comments,”
said Harry Homes, “but Wallindas taste in clothes makes
her qualifications questionable. To be a. true DOG," one must
not only possess the physical qualities, but also dress appro-
priately. Wallinda has/good taste in clothes—-she wears the
latest styles, buys at the best places, and has a variety of
good outﬁts. She’s deﬁnitely too good a dresser to be a DOG.”

1 “Yes, but I really ”don’t think you should give so much
weight to the clothing factor Harry,” said Walter. “Wal-
linda tries so hard to be ugly. She cakes on her makeup, she
doesn’t use Lavoris or Scope, she constantly eats greasy
foods to maingiin her 220 pound physique, and she’s just
a well-rounded girl.” , ._

' “I’ll agree with Walter,” said John John, “Wallinda is

‘ really a nice girl. She . . . ” At this point the chairman inter-

ceded, “Being nice is not a criteria in choosing a DO-G, John

John. I must caution all of you not to impose ‘our own val-
ues in evaluating these women.”

‘_‘WELL I DON’T care What Walter says, Wallinda
turned me down for a date purely out of selfish motives,”
said Hubert Herbert. “After she refused my offer, I found
out the reason from one of her girl friends. She said I
wasn‘t handsome enough. A DOG tappee should not be con-

ceited. As we discussed at last tapping-session, a DOG is’

lucky to be asked out at all and should not be picky.”



“um

“All I can say is that you’re not being NI-CE guys. Wal— I

lindai is really great, fantastic, as far as ugliness goes. She’s

,_,'one of the_ugliest gir1s_I have ever dated,” said Walter des- _

perately. , - _ _
“As much as I hate to say this, I must be fair,” said

Hubert. “Wa1linda does have some features in her favor.
She has a terrific knack with hair styles. I remember once
she wore a crew cut and last summer she had a baldy. It
was truly one of the most terrific innovations in ugliness in

years.” *

\

“C’MON FELLAS,” said John John, “I’m getting tired ,
already. Besides we’ve got a lot more DOGS to tap, so let’s .

get going.”

— f‘I realize we. have many potential DOGS to discuss this
evening,” said Walter, itching his face, “but I must say just
one more thing about Wallinda; because she’s so great, fan-
tastic as far as ugliness goes. She has tatoos on her biceps.
When I had a date with her she made a muscle for me and
the battleship guns on the tatoos expanded. Whatmore can
you ask for ugliness ?” 0

“But her ugliness might only'be skin deep,” said. Hu-

bert.” I hope the brothers will consider that the tatoos '

might only be a superﬁciality. We need DOGS with deep,
down ugliness.”

“I’M TIRED, can’t
“C’mon fellas.” ' _

“Well,”« said the chairman, “If there’s no other perti-
nent discussion, we’ll take a vote. Again, the nominee is
Wallinda Wallinda. If you feel. she should be tapped /mark
your ballot “UGLY.” If you feel she "is not qualified mark
your ballot “NOT UGLY.”   ’

we take a vote?” said John. John.

_. - AFTER THE FIRST PLATEAU
- I disliked going to watch a losing basketball team, and
that's what I did all term. A 5-17 record stinks! No matter
 hard the team fought this year or how close they came,
they always managed to blow it.
“  . Just two years ago the Panthers went to the  tour-
nament, and three years ago to the NCAA. We dldn t have
aj great team, no real super stars. Brian Generalovich was
good, but no All-American. The same was true of Cal Shef-
ﬁeld. Paul Kreiger, Dave Roman, Tim Grgurich and Dave
Sauer were just average ballplayers. I
5 They won though! They didn’t win at the tournaments,
but they had respectable teams. They didn’t have a man
taller than six-foot-ﬁve and he played center. That team did
two things that this year’s team‘ couldn't do——play together
_and play defense. _ _
 They forced the other teams into t1lI'n0Ve1‘S With then‘
man to man press. They worked it beautifully. They ‘worked
the fast breaks as though they practiced it all the1r.l1ves.
Their passing was superb. They won without ‘any height.
 Why has there been this sudden plunge by Pitt basket-
ball. Is it the coach’s fault? D1dn’t he coach the great teams
with Don Hennon and Julius Peques and Dick Falenski? HIS
ability to coach then was never questioned. ,
 Bob Timmons has proven he can win, what he hasnt
proven is that he can recruit consistently. There were two
bad years in a row before 'I‘immons got a pretty good fresh-
men team here this year. But can he do it next season?
For Pitt basketball to continue on the upswing, good
freshmen teams must be recruited. It is hard to imagine Pitt
basketball on the upswing after posting a 5-17 mark, but if
a couple of tall guys are convinced to attend here next year,
the Panthers will be a big winner. Even without big men

they will win consistently.

MORE ATTRACTIVENESS NEEDED
Besides bringing in a good freshmen team, however,
some other changes are going to have to be made to promote
student interest. Have only one game -with Westminister
and Carnegie Tech. Change the whole schedule to make it
more attractive. This has been done with the addition of
some southern basketball teams next year. ,

 ‘ Another hypo would be to change the Steel Bowl into
"atop-ﬂight basketball tournament. Now it isn’t even third-
-rate. This won’t be done for at least one more year because
-the two teams in next years tournament will be Cornell and
-Air Force.

 Cornell is coming in because they have Hank South,
the best Catholic League basketball player in Western Penn-
sylvania. He is expected to be a big draw. He almost came
to Pitt, but his parents were Cornell graduates. The other
‘team will be the Air Force because they have six-foot-ten
Cliff Parsons, former Gateway High star, also a big drawing
card in this area.

A new coach won’t help the Panthers, unless the re-

cruiting isn’t done. What they need is a more attractive
schedule to generate some excitement about a sport that
has had a proud heritage at Pitt.

Panther Chances Limited in EIWA

By TOM SACKS
The Fitzgerald Field House
has already shifted into high
gear for this Weekend’s
Eastern Wrestling tourna-
ment. The preliminary

rounds started at~1 p.m. to-
day. The quarter-ﬁnals get under
way at 7:30 p.m. tonight.

Tomorrow will be split into
the semi-finals and ﬁnals: Favor-
ed to take the team title is Le-
high, with Navy ﬁnishing second.

The Panther matmen will be
out of the running this year. An
injury has removed defending
145-pound champion Dino Boni
from competition.

Dick Shildt win be competing _

in the 123-pound division, but the
statistical information on his op-

ponents makes the going look.

rough for him. The kingpin in
this area is Lehigh’s Mike Caru-
so, the defending, Eastern and
NCAA champion.

At 130, Ron Schuchert carries-

the best Panther dual meet rec-
ord (6-3) into the tournament,
but the records of several of his

opponents are even more impres-
sive. The defending champ is
Army’s Bob Steenlage, whose rec-
ord is 6-0-1. The draw was with
Engineer Joe Peritore, who also
hasn't been beaten this year.

The next two weight classes
are trouble spots for’ the Pan-
thers. Cliff Zolikoff wrestled 137
at Penn State several weeks ago,
but he was so drained by the
loss of weight, he wasn’t able to
put up an effective attack. At
145, Jim Rhone might be able
to ﬁt in. ‘

The big attraction of the 137-
poundddivision won’t be Zolikoff,
even if he does manage to cut
the weight. The attention will
be centered on defending cham-
pion Bill Stuart of Lehigh and

Wayne Hicks of Navy. The two‘

seniors drew, 2-2, in a dual meet
at Annapolis in February.

Clair Riley has a good shot for
a top ﬁnish in the 152 class if he
draws a good seed. The two ma-
jor obstacles in his way are Penn
Stat’é’s Dick DeWalt and Temple’s
Al Lilley.

Tim Trax (160) wasn’t that

successful in the dual meet sea-
son and his chances in the East-
erns don’t look much more prom-
ising. The big name. in this weight
class is State’s Jerry Seaman,
who is undefeated thus far this
year.

There are three wrestlers who
stand out in the 167-pound divi-
sion. They are Lehigh’s Jon Rush-
atz, Cornell’s Jeff Stephens, and
Navy's Dave Palmer. The. Pan-
ther entry will be Randy Kahlor.
The next weight class features
Tom Schlendorf, last year’s run-
ner-up.

If Panther Jack Williams’ arm

is back in top shape, he should
be able to collect a few more
points for coach Dave Johnson.
The leading contenders for the
191-pound crown are Navy's Gui-
do Carloni and Cornell’s’ Bill
Buchwald. 

Jim Nance’s graduation has
left the heavyweight crown hotly
contested. The Panther candidate
is Terry Hoover. His toughest op-
ponents should be Paul Goble of
Rutgers and John Nichols of

Navy.

Hahnfeldt, Lane, LeViere I Chosen

For Eastern Swim Tournament

Last year swimming coach Ben
Grady tried every known formu-
la to build and rebuild his de-
pleted squad. He had to wait for
positive results, however, until
this season. The result came in
triplicate (all student records). ’

Three members of the swim-
ming team, co-captain Don Hahn-
feldt, Joe LeViere, and John
Lane accompanied Grady to the
Eastern Collegiate Swimming
Championships held‘ at the Naval
Academy in Maryland. It is the
ﬁrst trip for Lane and LeViere,
but for Hahnfeldt this will be his
second and ﬁnal trip.

Hahnfeldt, who competed in
the Easterns as a sophomore,
comes highly rated. “He is one
of the best divers in «the East,”
said (Grady, “and he’ll be around
the top of the list in the East-

During the regular season Hahn-
feldt had his good and bad days,
but he managed to win seven of
11 high board diving events. His
record is just the reverse of the
mermen’s dismal showing. I

“There are 2.5 factors that can
effect-a diver in every dive,” said
Grady, a former diver himself.
“No diver ever feels ready even
though he may say he does be-
cause each dive involves years of
training.” '

Everytime Grady wrote Lane’s

name on the entry card for either
the 200 or 500-yard freestyle
events, he was almost assured of
two ﬁrst places. In 11 meets this
year, Lane has lost only twice in-
each event. ‘ —

Still Lane’s -time of 151.9 in‘

the 200-/yarder is one and one-

half seconds over the University
record while his 5:18.9 in the 500
event
school mark.

As far as the tournament goes,
the preliminary diving trials
started yesterday. The ﬁnals will
be held with the swimming events
tomorrow.
