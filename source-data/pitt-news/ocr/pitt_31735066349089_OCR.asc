SG to Plan Tuition Defense

BY TOM WENSTON

Preparation of a program aimed
at combating any future tuition
increases was suggested by Stu-
dent Government Board (SGB)
President Larry Platt at the Board’s
Wednesday meeting. V

‘ ‘There is no reason not to expect
tuition to rise within the next ﬁve
years,” Platt said.

SG member Mark Satinoff
promised to contact several student
and national organizations to
research possible ways to help ﬁght

J rising tuition.

,.v,_ f}

“Mark’s list of resources will
probably be used by a future
Board,” Platt said. “We were
caught off guard when a tuition

increase was announced last year,
but the next‘ Board won’t have to
play games, or just argue about the
problem.”

University tuition was raised this
year by 14% over the objections of
Platt and other student leaders who
claimed there was not enough
student input in the decision to hike
tuition. ,

In other action, the SGB will
insist on a separate student section
at the Pitt-Penn State football game
November 23 if it is held at Three
Rivers Stadium, according to SGB
member Craig ‘Bluestein.

“We don ’t want student seats
scattered all over the stadium like
last Thanksgiving,” Bluestein said.

Candidates’ DayRaIIy  
Attracts Large Crowd

BY GEORGENE KALEINA
Over half the candidates invited
to Candidates’ Day Rally 1975,
sponsored by the College Young
Democrats (CYD) and College
Young Republicans (CYR), assem-
bled in the Venetian Room
’ yesterday to meet and answer
student questions.
Approximately 275 students
greeted the 26 candidates vying for
Allegheny County positions with a
warm reception. “The overwhelm-

ing success of the turnout of

candidates proves they aren't
overlooking the campus votes,”
CYR Secretary Marnie Abraham
said.

“There was a dismal turnout for
the last primary election rally,”
CYD Publicity Director Hank
Kearney said. “I’m really pleased
with the success of this one."

—*' ‘Democrat Jim Flaherty, Inde-

 

pendent Michelle Madoff and
Socialist Workers Party member
‘candidate Steffi Brooks were the

only candidates for county’ commis-

 

sioner at the rally.

Other candidates at the rally
included Bernard Markovitz, Re-
publican candidate. for district
attorney; Democrat Dr. Edward F.
Cooke and Republican George F.

Pott, Jr., candidates for county

treasurer; Wayne Kelly Democratic
candidate for clerk of courts, and
Democrat John Joyce and Republi-
can Jay R. Wells, candidates for
prothonotary.

Democratic and Republican can-
didates for Common Pleas Court
Judges and Pittsburgh City Council
were well-represented throughout
the day.

A special election for state

‘senator, from the 43rd district is

being conducted to fill the
unexpired term of ousted Frank
Mazzei. Rev. Samuel Gibson, an
Independent candidate for Maz-
zei’s seat, also answered questions
for students at the rally.
The’ rally was_ begun by the
Citizenship Information Center, now

“I talked about this with (Athletic
Director) Cas Myslinski.”

“Students get some of the best
seats at Pitt Stadium,” Board
member Mary Schwarz said. “If
there’ll be a student section at
Three Rivers, it shouldn’t be in the
end zone.”

A new student ﬁnancial aid
booklet is being" readied, according
to Bluestein. The booklet will
include sections on ﬁnancial aid,

' consumerism, food stamps, social

security beneﬁts, odd jobs, intern-
ships and studying abroad.

‘Blacks Still Troub|ed'—Bond

BY NORM MARTELLO
Civil rights activist and Georgia

State Senator Julian Bond blamed-

current economic conditions on “a
system that adjusts itself to placate
people in a minimal way.”

He told a Student Union
ballroom crowd Wednesday that
despite strides toward black
equality over the past 25 years,
problems faced by blacks. remain
unchanged.

Bond said even though blacks
can use social facilities and have
begun to gain public ofﬁces in
number, “most blacks earn less
than $4,000 a year, they're the last
to hire and the ﬁrst to ﬁre.”

Bond explained the “system” as
a small privileged class at the top, a
large group with little or no income
at the bottom, and a heavily taxed
middle class supporting limited
social programs and the privileged
class.

“Despite a decade of protest, a
massive coalition of the comfor-
table, the callous and the smug
hold the power and uphold the
massive nulliﬁcation of the needs
of the needy,” he said.

Bond acknowledged the social
services’ provided by the Great
Society and New Frontier _pro-

Dorm Students Critical     

Of New Escort Policy  

BY LISA RUBENSTEIN

An overwhelming majority of Pitt
dormitory residents dislike the
present escort policy in the dorms.

Of 100 students surveyed yester-
day by the Pitt News, 77 said they
disliked the ‘escort policy, 17 said
they liked it and six had no

‘ preference.

Most students opposed to the
escort policy, said the plan was an
unnecessary bother, particularly
for resident students visiting in
other dorms.

“I think there should be
unrestricted movement between
the Towers,” Bill Small, at Tower B
resident said. “If you have your
ID, the University should recognize
you as a respectable person.”

Barb Seckman of McCormick
Hall agreed, “If the personvis a
resident, I don’t think you should
have to escort them upstairs. I’d
rather see it the way it was
before.”

Under the new escort policy,
residents must meet their guests at
the security desk and both must

‘show identiﬁcation: Guests must

be escorted at all times.

Last year, guests could call
residents from the security desk
and go to the residents’ rooms
without an escort.

Even residents supporting the

‘escort policy said there were some

inconveniences.

“I like the system because there
is no way an unauthorized person
can get into the building,” Kathy
Chiprich of _ Holland Hall said.
“However, I don’t think you should
have to escort your guest out of the

 

building.” . ' V
Another resident said, “To keep

the place safe, you have to

sacriﬁce.” ’

Resident students were surveyed
in the Towers cafeteria, the Towers
lobby and the Quad.

Some students complained that
in certain cases a guest shouldn’t
have to produce identification as
long as the resident acknowledges
the guest’s arrival.

“My parents had to show

identiﬁcation in order to come up to ,

my room. That seems kind "of
stupid,” Debbie Brezinski of
Holland Hall said. I

“I know of one girl whose mother '

wasn’t allowed up because she,

didn’t have identiﬁcation,” Brezin-‘ . I

ski said. I
Many students surveyed sug4

gested modiﬁcations to the present ‘

system, including different policies
for each residence hall.

“There’s. no reason to» have~to;  ~
escort a woman around, Holland’

Hall,” Holland resident Becky
Peace said.

Jim Spagnola of‘ McCormick’

suggested a total change. “The
system is too restrictive as it is
now.
students patrol the dorms.

“If someone acts suspicious1y,'\I .» 
think a student on patrol will watch _
out for another student's inter-

ests, ’ ’ Spagnola said.

The escort policy became effec-

tive Monday, October 6, and has

been the subject of controversy ‘ 

between resident students and the
administration.

SYMPHONY STRIKE

PITTSBURGH AP—The Pitts-
burgh Symphony Society says it
will not increase its wage offer to
striking musicians.

Society President John E. Angle
said Wednesday, “Our latest offer
is the best they will get.”

The musicians rejected that offer
on Monday.

Angle said the current deadlock
could be broken if the musicians’
union agreees to rearrange the
present package so they find it
acceptable.

FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES

the national treasury and not by

“These changes promise more

On the youth‘ movement, he

“became rhetorical and sartorial,
measured by length of hair and

trickiness of handshake.”

During a question and answer

Eventually one economic entity
could own everything.”

The Keys tothe Kingdom

BY BILL KALMAN

A few weeks ago, Secretary of
State Henry Kissinger denied
Hugo Blanco a visa to enter the
United States. Well, you ask, who
is Hugo Blanco?

Blanco is a noted author. He has
written extensively on political
events in South America (such as
the 1973 coup in Chile). His book
on the Peruvian peasant struggles,
Land or Death, was hailed by the
Library Journal as “necessary
reading for those involved with
contemporary Latin America.”
Choice, the journal of the American
Library Association, named Land
or Death as an outstanding
academic book for 1972.

Blanco was the principal organ-
izer of the peasant unions in his
native Peru. In the early sixties, he
organized tens of thousands of
Quechua peasants to do the
unthinkable: to take -back’ the lands
stolen from them, to stop working
for their exploiters and to start
working for themselves——in short,
to declare themselves human
beings.

And Blanco is a socialist. He is a
member of the Fourth Internation-
al, and it is through the viewpoint
of revolutionary Marxism that he
analyzes the political situation in
South America. But, you ask, why
does he want to enter the United
States?

A number of universities, politi-
cal groups and academic circles
had invited Blanco to’ speak on
political repression in Latin Amer-
ica. A national speaking tour was to
begin September 25, right here at
Pitt. But the tour, sponsored by the

US Committee for Justice in Latin _

American Political Prisoners
(USLA), never got off the ground.
Well, you ask, how did the
government deny Blanco’s visa
application?

After dusting" off the .McCarran-_

_ But what happened?  

Walter Act, a piece of witch-hunt-
ing legislation frequently used in
the ﬁfties, the White House
contended that Blanco’s political
views render him “ineligible” to
enter the country. So, you say, why
make a big deal of it?

The government's actions in
denying‘Blanco a visa can only be
considered the height of hypocrisy
It is now clear that, as Ford and
Kissinger were signing the Helsin-
ki agreement at the end of July,
maneuvers already were underway
to denyrBlanco’s visa. Among the
speciﬁc sections of the accord
violated by Ford and Kissinger are:

(1) “The participating States will
respect human rights. and funda-
mental freedoms, including the
freedom of thought,‘ conscience...
and belief...”

(2) “The participating States...’ _

make it their aim to facilitate the
freer and wider dissemination of‘
information of all kinds...”

(3) “To facilitate the dissemina-
tion of oral information through the
encouragement of lectures and
lecture tours by personalities and
specialists...” ' '

(4) “To promote wider dissemin-
ation of books and artistic works, in

particular by such means as...in-

ternational contacts and commun-
ications between authors and
publishing houses...”

"This last point pertains to the
fact that due to his visa denial,
Blanco now cannot consult with
Pathfinder Press, which publishes
his writings, thus hampering
efforts to publish and promote

books here and intemationally.
quite clear the US --

It is
government violated the Helsinki

Gerald Ford's presidential debut
-was all-American: he was appar-
ently ‘honest, ‘as proved by

‘ investigations; he was physially fit

for someone his age, and he was a
former football player. He had a
wife who was socially active, and
four good-looking kids who'also_
were all-American. People believed
in him, football players especially,
and I almost believed in him
myself. . _

~ . A few weeks back, however, my
belief waskicked in its side when a _
friendly radio newsman reported
that Betty Ford stated she would
not be surprised if her daughter, ,
Susan, was not a virgin,’ or if any of
her children had experimented‘
with ‘drugs. I had to be hearing

‘Somehow’ the idea of federal

things. “Repeat that," I demanded
and-shook the radio from whence
the voice came. The information
was repeated, but I still could not
believe it. Did Mrs. Ford expect
such things of her children?

Did she condone them? Even if
she did, she did not have to have
her family's affairs broadcast all
over the country and God only
knows where else.

More recently Jack Ford admit-
ted to smoking marijuana, fulﬁlling
his mother's expectations. The
president openly stated he did not
approve of his son's smoking, but
he was’ glad of his honesty. Does
honesty, then, make Jack's’ law-
breaking all right, or does the fact
heis the'President’s son erase the
problem? ' ' - ~

agents questioning Jack beneath a

snooping through his room, is a bit
disillusioning. Where would a
Pre'_sident’s son keep _ marijuana
anyway? In hiszsock drawer? In his
night stand? Maybe inside a secret
compartment in "his gold pocket

maybe it sits inconspicuously in --

one of the many rooms in the White
House. Judging from Jack and
Susan, who possibly lacks morals
or self-control, or wonders what the
other two have been up to.

about the First Family indicate the

their children? Could-this reflect

After the Peruvian government"_ 1‘
arrested Blanco in 1963, it held him "

for three years before deciding to
execute him. When this decision
was made public, Blanco’s com-
rades organized an enormous..
international campaign. Supporters
of this massive effort to save
Blanco’s life included Isaac Dents-
cher, Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de
Beauvoir, the International League
for Human Rights-,* Amnesty
International and Bertrand Russell.
Hundreds -of thousandsqof people

, petitioned and demonstrated ‘for

Blanco, including hundreds of
peasants in Arauco, Chile; the

Italian Confederation of Labor; 4.3.,-.T

ment; 3,000 sugar workers in India;
7,000 trade unionists in Canada; 10 ’
members of the British parliament; ’
the Santiago, Chile, Chamber of
Deputies; over 400 scholars in the
United States and tens of thou-
sands- in Pero itself.

.And now, after the US govern-
ment has denied Blanco a’ visa,
thousands of Americans are’say-
ing,“‘Let us hear what he has to
say.” Among the many "people
involved in demanding Blanco "be,
given a visa are Ruday Perpich,
lieutenant governor of Minnesota;
Local 1304, United Steelworkers of

the University of Minnesota ‘Press

Bella Abzugand Ronald Dellums,
members of the ~US_.Congress, and

-the American Civil Liberties Union

The United States has shown,
time and again, its preference for
those who seek to subvert
democracy over those who ﬁght for
its extension. The Blanco case is
but one more example. As Leland

  Turning Back
Hands of Clock ‘

When I read Dan Mulholland’s
article in the October 3 Pitt News,
“The ‘Darker Ages,” _Ijust had to
laugh. To be sure, it was
consistent with his previous ridicu-
lous articles, but this time Mulhol-
land really outdid himself in
authoring this collection of fanati-
cal right wing garbage.

4, In saying that the United States
was a nation under God until the

1960s, does Mulholland portend I

that the slaughtering of the
Indians, the enslavement of black
people, and the abject oppression
of the working class was all done
under God’s watchful and approv-
ing eye? It wasn’t until the 1960s
that a lot of people and begun to
see through the myth of America’s
glorious heritage. The civil rights
movement's stand against racism
and the anti-war movement’s stand
against the genocidal war in
Indochina was more in tune with
the teachings of God than were the
governments policies.

Mulholland goes on to assert that
.“unsavory groups such as the
American Civil Liberties Union
have conspired to destroy every
aspect of American life once held
sacred.” I nearly choked on that
one! The ACLU is a group of
conscientious lawyers, legal work-
ers and volunteers who are

engaged in a struggle to uphold

personal freedoms guaranteed us
by no less than the Bill of Rights of
the constitution, something that I
think most Americans hold sacred‘.
The ACLU would even defend your
right, Dan Mulholland, to write the
crap that you’ve been writing.
I"was appalled that a university

Letters to the Editor

be against sexual self-determina-
tion, humanist philosphy, and the
teaching of evolution. The irony in
his suggestion that we are entering
a» new “Dark Age” is that
Mulholland's beliefs philosophic-
ally and politically are in line with
those of the Dark Ages of yore. His
writings prove that he wants to turn
back the hands of the clock, ‘which
is the way of all reactionaries.

Sexism as Seen

From Other Side

I am writing this letter in
response to Bill Kalman’s article on
sexism (Pitt News, October 10).
Kalman does indeed point out
many interesting examples of
sexism at the University.
However, I must take issue with
many of Kalman’s viewpoints

about wbmen and what they

beheve.

Mr. Kalman-, you are correct.
Women are “tired of being
reduced to walking talking sex
organs and then being subjected to

quack psychoanalysis when they
object to such treatment.” We also
object to generalizations about us,
our beliefs and opinions. Especial-

,ly since every woman as an

individual has a mind with which to
form personal opinion. Many of
your assertations misrepresent the
opinions of many women, myself
included.

You state that “a fetus has no
independent experience in the
world...no thoughts or emotions,”
and that it “...has the capacity for
further life under certain condi-
tions.” Also falling into this
category are the newborn and
prematurely born baby. Following
your logic, no efforts should be
made to assist this life either.

You also contend that “Nobody
is in a position to decide whether or
not a woman should go through the
process of carrying, bearing and
raising a child except the woman
herself.” True statement, Mr.
Kalman, but shouldn't this “deci-
sion” come before the act? This

"decision will involve contraception,

eliminating the need for most
abortions.

Unless you can produce broadly
based statistical -evidence, you
have no right to _ make the
allegation "that pro-life people
“speak in the mythical interests of
fetuses,” or that they “are often

contradiction to this stereotype.

Finally, Mr. Kalman, I think
your own sexism surfaces in your
statement that the status of a wife
or mother is “dependent and
subservient.” True, this is too
often the situation experienced by
many women. But beliefs like
yours have the potential of
perpetuating this ‘image. Status is
determined by popular opinion.
Many women enjoy marriage and
motherhood, and many combine it
with a_ career. Many men do not

-make their wives dependent and

subservient. Do you propose we
eliminate the family unit? The

faults with it begin with attitudes

such as yours.

I admire your efforts in pointing
out injustices that have been
wrought ‘against women in our

long way to go towards ending
discrimination in our country. But
please, in the future -limit your
statements to facts, and base your

money used to start this sytem has
bene used unwisely, for it has not

There is a certain art to being a
student/ spectator that seems to be
an integral part of Pitt’s" home
games. It is this art that can turn
the dullest of games into an
exciting afternoon outing.

In order to be a true practitioner
_(*;;..9f the art and thus earn the exalted
 ' title “Fan,” there are a number of

skills the Pitt must master_.

First and foremost is the ability
to smuggle contraband into Pitt
stadium. This contraband includes
liquor or any other substance_ that
leads to an altered state. of
consciousness.

On the whole, Pitt students are
quite adept at this. If one were to

‘ count the empty bottles at the end
of a Pitt game, he would calculate
that the student spectators had
consumed enough alcoholic bever-
ages to ﬂoat a battleship.

Probably the best method for
smuggling contraband is Ye Old
Wineskin. The wineskin may be

 worn under a jacket. A light jacket

' "may betray a slight bulge, so a
heavy jacket isbest. The heavy
jacket is not advisable in 70-degree
weather, as you may die of heat
prostration beforeyou take a swig.

Another good method is hiding a
bottle in a purse. This sometimes
may limit the smuggler as to the
size of the bottle he smuggles, but
one usually can compensate for
that by bringing in stronger booze.

The possibilities are endless, but
if a student is not capable of
bringing a bottle of something or
other into the Stadium, then no
matter how loud he cheers, he

; never can be a true fan.

— ' Another important skill to master
on the way to becoming a “Fan” is
the throwing of large Coke lids onto

the ﬁeld. ‘

' This is perhaps the most difﬁcult
of all skills to master. Because
students must throw the lids from
high in the stands, the lids must
ﬁght against the wind to make it to

‘ the ﬁeld. In the Duke game, only
two or three lids made it to the ﬁeld
and not one hit a policeman. Poor
showing, folks.

The Coke lid must be thrown like
a Frisbee, with most of the power
originating in the wrist. Do not
attempt to throw the lid down

-,*"f't’oward the ﬁeld or it never will get

T” there. A smooth, level throw will
give you the necessary distance
and the lid will do the rest, ﬂoating

enjoyed working as a masseuse,
and simply liked to make people

She implied she learned a lot
about the art of massage with her
husband’s help (yes, her husband).
He indicated what felt the best. In
many parlors the women are
required to take a program in
massage techniques. .

“Massage parlors have a deﬁn--

ite social purpose,” she said.
“Many people are lonely or just
want someone to talk to. ‘They
want someone to touch them and
baby them a little. Everybody likes
that.

“Most guys don’t come here
looking to get laid,” she noted.
"For as much as some put out for a
massage, they could get anything
they wanted off the streets or at a
house. So why bother with a
massage parlor?”

She mentioned that massaging is
legal (it is), and she could see
nothing morally wrong with it.
Otherwise, she wouldn't do it.

“But I’m no women’s libber in
this area (sex),” she said. “If a

‘Wine’ Fails with Provocative Style

‘BY DAVID ASHLEY
How does a nice white kid from a

' quiet middle-class neighborhood

who spent most of his life in
England justify offering a review of
a _“black play” enthusiastically

. received by an almost exclusively

black audience at the Nixon
Theater this week? The answer (at
least as far as I am concerned) is
that he doesn’t. ‘

7 Havingvpresented certain facts,
if rather ﬂippantly, and noted that
some readers might ﬁnd them

. signiﬁcant, all I can do is report

certain impressions I received
about a play that ultimately I
consider a failure, but which I
found intensely provocative and
occasionally moving.

unsatisfactory.

fatherless and without direction,
Rico takes an interest in the boy,
“tipping” him for favors and
errands, and like any surrogate
father, attempting to share his
experiences with him. As Rico
explains quite ingenuously: “Like

don't have no son, you dig? So,
like I want to---uh---adopt you.

Ron Trice and Debbie Morgan as
two lovers in Ron Milner’s What
the Wine-Sellers Buy playing at the
Nixon theatre.

Yeh, adopt you, and lay it out, turn
you on to it all, jus’ like if you were
mine.” .

Rico’s interest in the boy is
matched by that of Steve’s mother
in her efforts to keep her son away
from what she feels to be Rico’s

/

 

“corrupting" inﬂuence. Her life
has been a constant struggle
against the persistent exploitation
of her many employers and the
squalor and uncertainty of grinding
poverty. Her advice to Steve is that
he should ﬁnish school, work hard
and stay out of trouble. As Rico
asks so brusquely: for what? The
black world, he explains, is divided
into two classes: those who exploit
and those who are exploited; those
who are successful pimps and
hustlers and those who are not; the
“smart dudes” and the “chicken-
shit punks,’s the “po’ ass niguhs,”

Steve’s dilemma is this. Rico is a
successful pimp and he moves a lot
of ass. Milner is particularly
successful in portraying the curious
symbiotic relationship that exists
between a pimp and his women,
and of course, as well as being able
to-commoditize so many “black
bitches,” Rico enjoys the use of
commodities cast» in less animate
form.

The pimp’s external wealth is
fabulous, from his $45 platforms to
his “hog” parked at the curb.
Consequently, and quite under-
standably, as an alternative to
casual labor and unemployment,
the young adolescent ﬁnds “Rico’s
way” has its attractions. Steve’s
girl friend Mai, sensitively played
by Debbie Morgan, loves Steve and
furthermore has marketable pro-
perties. Rico’s position is that
Steve should hustle Mai’s ass in
lieu of what hopefully will one day
be a’ more extensive franchise.

Magic Touch
BY PAMELA EUSI

The stage is set, nothing
special, nothing glamourous.
Excitement hums in the air. A
wave of applause suddenly crests
over the performers as they appear
onstage. One man in particular
seems especially inauspicious.
Nothing special, nothing glamor-

ous Ithought, noting that he does '

look a little like Yul Brynner. Janos
Starker sits down at his cello and
nods to the pianist Alain Planes as
the evening of music begins.

Bach’s Sonata No. 2 in D Major
[for Viola da gamba and Piano] led
you into the myriad world of the
Baroque. As you can see by the
title, Bach was fond of getting his
money's worth out of thevmusic he
wrote. .Very often he would

transcribe his pieces for quite a

number of different instruments.
In this ca_se the transcription did
not hurt the spirit of the piece at all
as the cello is the viola's close
relative in the family of musical
instruments.

Tender, graceful passages kept
the initial tone of the piece down to
incidental music with the piano
remaining more or less in the
background. _Then the cello and
piano parts became «intertwined,

Low, rich tones from the cello

style rather than brilliance in

BY RICK ST OUFFER
Sports Editor '

The mascot for the Military
Academy Cadets at West Point has
been a mule since 1899. A lot of
people have compared the play of
the Army football team to a bunch
of  (synonym for mule) since,.
for the last few years, the.Cadets
just haven't won like the power-
houses they once were.

Last year the Cadets found7a new
coach, Homer Smith (Princeton
’54)_ and a new offensive system
(the wishbone) and ﬁnished the

,_,/7,; season with a 3-8 record. They

were 0-10 the year before, so
anything would have- been an
improvement.

This year Smith is looking for a
better showing from the Cadets.
Going into the Pitt game, the West
Pointers have lost to Stanford,
Villanova and Duke and have
beaten Holy Cross and Lehigh.

Despite the record, the offense
hasn’t been stagnant. Army has
had more first downs (115-80),
more yards rushing (1130-892),
more yards passing (849-801) and
more total offense (1979-1693) than
their opponents.

“Army always plays with a lot of

pride,” said Pitt Head Coach
Johnny Majors. “They never quit
and probably play more above their
ability than any other team in the
nation. We will have to_ show them
we are better.” , V —

On the other side, Smith isn’t too
optimistic playing the Panthers.

“Pitt’s offensive tackles (John
Hanhauser and Joe Stone) are very
good tackles and the machinery in
the backﬁeld worries us,” Smith
said. “We are deﬁnitely disap-
pointed with our record but if we
were to beat Pitt it would be one of
the biggest victories in the history
of the Academy.”

The Cadet who most‘ wants that
upset is Leamon Hall, a 6-5
sophomore who has completed 56
of 96' passes for 708 yards and six
touchdowns. Right now Hall is
listed as questionable because of a
sprained" shoulder suffered against
Duke. -His backup is Brian
Womble, a mere plebe (that’s
Army talk for freshman).

The big runners for the Cadets
are Tony Pyne at fullback and Brad
Dodrill at the halfback slot. Pyne
has carried for 374 yards while
Dodrill has picked up a total or 231
yards. Neither runner is known for
his quickness, but they are bruising

Bears Will Be Patsies

As Steelers Roll On

BY YAIER LEHRER

Picture a sky full of flying
footballs with Terry Bradshaw
launching" the missiles and Steeler
receivers pulling them down. If
you can do that then you have a
good image of what Sunday’s game
against the Chicago Bears should
look like. '

The Bears come to Three Rivers
Stadium ‘with the worst passing
defense in the NFL. Bradshaw
comes into the game as one of the
leading passers in the AFC with a
67.1 completion percentage.‘ It’s
not even close. '

The most interesting thing to

watch in Sunday’s game will be.

whether the Steeler running game
can bounce back against an above
average Bear defensive line led by
Wally Chambers.

The Steeler running attack has
been less than impressive this
season, causing the Steelers to
rely heavily on Bradshaw's arm,
and while it should not hurt them in
the,Chicago game, the Pittsburgh
runners had better get the

,.,,,_adrenalin going before they face

it

* the real meat of their schedule.

The Steelers have lacked speed
in the backﬁeld all season long,
especially at the halfback position

where Rocky Bleier continues to‘

plod slowly but surely. With rookie
running back Mike Collier sitting
on the bench, this should’ not be the
case. p '

Collier is a quicker" back and
could take a lot of the pressure off
Franco. .

. “I know I'll get my chance,” said
Collier after the poor showing by
the Steeler runners in last Sunday’s
Denver game. “I’m faster than
Rocky and I can block as well, but
right now I’ll sit back and learn
until they give me the call.”

While the offense tries to wake
up from a sluggishness that

sometimes comes with compla-
cency, the defense should have an
eas-y afternoon. Chicago ranks last
in the NFL in total offense, also.
It is hard to believe the Chicago
Bears were once the bad boys‘ of
the monster “Black and Blue”
division that ‘included the Packers
and Lions when all those teams
were good“ and mean. Today, the
Bears, as well as the "Packers are

nothing more than cannon fodder ,_

for the NFL contenders.

' This is not to say that the Bears
do not have the raw talent, they
have just not been able to put a
potent attack together. '

Walter Payton and Cid Edwards
are both good running backs, while
the receiving corps of the Bears
includes Bob Grim, formerly of the
Giants, Greg Latta, who caught 39
passes for the Florida Blazers
under Coach Jack Pardee (now
coach of the Bears) and let us not
forget former Steeler end Ron
Shanklin who became expendable
this year and is now on the Bears’
injury list. A

At quarterback, the Bears have
Gary Huff, who when he last
played against a Pittsburgh team
threw a touchdown pass to Barry
Smith of his, Florida State team to
defeat the Pitt Panthers. Huff still
is developing, no longer feeling the

_pressure from Bobby Douglass,

who ﬁnally was cut by the Bears in
their rebuilding program.

There is no question as to the
outcome of this game, it's just a
matter of how many points can
Bradshaw put on the board, how
many yards can the Steelers gain
on the ground,_ and can the Steel
Curtain pull off a shutout? j .

For the Steelers this should be
nothing more than a practice
scrimmage, a time to polish up on
the fine points before they meet
Cincinnati, right now resting atop
the AFC Central Division.

Just follow the recipe and it
comes out perfect every time.

At least for the Pitt Soccer team.

The Panthers -took a little
offense, added a dash of change,
threw in a lot of defense, and

cooked up a 2-0 victory over‘

Indiana (of Pa.).
At the beginning of the game, it

looked as if Pitt Soccer Coach Leo ‘

Bemis had taken a step towards
being a candidate for the funny
farm; the changes he made were
surprising, considering his 3-3-1
team (now 4-3-1) wasn’t all that

, bad.

“I knew _the Indiana coach had
scouted us,” Bemis explained, “so
we made a couple of changes on
our offensive line.” _

And the result of his wily stirring
up would put Chef Boy-Ar-Dee to
shame.

The Pitt Kiffense scored two goals
against a stubborn Indiana defense
—pretty good, considering the
offense had only about 15 minutes
worth of practice with the new
changes.

“We did things we hadn’t been
doing,” Bemis said proudly.

Like bringing the attack to the
opposition—cons_tantly. The Pan-

thers offense 'badly outran and~

outshot the Indiana offense.
‘ ‘We did what we wanted to do, ’ ’
claimed Bemis about Pitt’s offen-

' sive display.

He then added, in a typical
coach's outlook of any game, “We
could have scored “at least 4 more
goals, though.’-’

But the Panthers did score two
against a strong defensive-minded
team. h

John Morahan opened it up for
Pitt in the ﬁrst half, scoring his 4th
goal of the season with an assist by
Tom Murphy. Pitt led at halftime,
1-0. ’

. Then, with the windat his back,
Ted Miller, making ' his ﬁrst
appearance on the varsity squad,

' got Pitt an insurance -goal late in

. According to the paper, Dark told h

The defense also had a great
game, chalking up its 3rd shutout

having "given up only 8‘ goals in 8
games. .

good job,” Bemis agreed. .

than to beat his former coach.

It's kind of a grudge match, you
might say. ,

Despite the relationship between
the two coaches, this will be the

looking forward to it.

More cautious than her country-

“It is going be be very difficult,”
she said. “I just hope to get to the

Santiago is even more optimistic.
“I should‘ get into the ﬁnals.

Even if the swimmers do not do
so well in Mexico City, their water
work will not be ﬁnished. The Pitt
season lies ahead.

_ For “Santiago, the games will
help his career at Pitt.

“Last year,” he explained, “I
was out of shape at the beginning.
Now, when the season starts, I will
be ready.”

The big difference, though, is
that only. one team will be able to
lay claim to his talents. '

Tankers to Mexico City

The Water Polo Club is not well
«known to many Pitt sports
afﬁcionados. Yet to date the Pitt
WP Club has been playing well and
boasts a 9-2 record. Recently, in a
tournament at the United States
Military Academy (West Point),
the splashers defeated clubs from
Fordham, Cornell, Columbia and
Villanova.

On the strength of its record the
Pitt club has received an invitation
to compete at the Eastern
Collegiate Water Polo Champion-
ships to be held at Brown
University in Providence, Rhode
Island.

‘Wine’ Sells Out toMoraIs I

(Continued from Page 1)

Rico is a ﬁgure of inﬁnite pathos,
»a* man who is tortured by the
environment which he sustains as it
succours him, and his own
self-awareness of the part he plays
in his barely concealed self-aliena-I
tion. The trimmings of a pimp
should have been seen as so much
ﬂoss; they should not have been
allowed to become deﬁnitive of the
man. The fact that King allows this
to happen is a major disaster.

The audience at the Nixon on
opening night became so disorient-
ed or so coarsened by the
production onstage that at the point
where Mai leaves her mother with
the plaintive farewell “Beating me

«; “Mama ainft the only way to touch

!

somebody,’ they found the epi-
sode comic. As the woman sitting
behind me asked: “why are they
laughing?” I couldn’t have told
her.

Wine-Sellers fails as a play
because connubial bliss, if such a
state exists, or any kind of
micro-solution, is no answer to_ the
kind of problem that Steve faces
as he sees his mother ground down
by her employers and his friends
sent to a school that seems largely
to be an institution for the creation
of second-rate basketball players.
Nothing the pupils are exposed to
in this school has any relevance for
_them. The course their lives will

_/F’ {eke is charted by unseen hands.

The dilemma around which this
“morality play" is organized has
institutional, not individual roots,
but this is barely explored by
Milner.
King’s production fails because
. the audience’s attention is channel-
ed in the wrong direction for the
wrong reasons. The set is
imaginatively designed; the action
is fast moving and well choreo-
graphed. The company as a whole

‘ tion.

act out their parts with great
enthusiasm and energy. But to
what end? One of the “black
critics" in a review of the original
production of Wine-Sellers de-
scribes Rico as “dazzlingly cor-
rupt." I want to know about the
roots of this “corruption.”

Part of the dramatic script, which
Milner for some reason makes
optional, and King unfortunately
chooses to exclude, has
pathetically trying to buy more and
more protection by successfully
going higher and higher into the
police department. Corruption
becomes less of an individual trait
than a type of interaction that
occurs between men who sustain
certain kinds of institutional
arrangements. King is reduced to
symbolizing Rico’s “corruption”
by having him pour cocaine and
pills over Steve’s head. The
imagery is hardly profound, but
profoundly irrelevant. _

Rico is a ﬁgure of inﬁnite pathos,
a man who is tortured by the
environment which he sustains as it
succours him, and his own
self-awareness of the part he plays
in his barely concealed self-aliena-
The trimmings of a pimp
should have been seen as so much
ﬂoss; they should not have been
allowed to become deﬁnitive of the
man. The fact that King allows this
to happen is a major disaster.

Steve’s problem is to work out
for himself the extent to which
everything can be reduced to its
exchange-value. Rico’s under-

-standing is that everything can,

although occasionally he whimsi-
cally muses to himself “...wonder
what the wine-seller buys one-half
so precious as what he sells.” I do

not know if Milner is a Marxist, but ‘

I have never seen a more profound
documentation of the potential
commodity-status of human beings
and the successful injection of

Rico .

market relations into every type of
human interaction.

With the help of his mother’s
friend, the “deacon” Jim Aaron,
who explains that a woman ‘is a
man’s “...supplement———what he-
needs to ‘ﬁnish himself,” Steve
decides that the love-obtaining
between Mai and himself is too’
precious to be exchanged for the
security enjoyed from the mere
control of commodities. The irony
of the deacon’s pronouncement as
a foil to the pimp seems to escape
him (I fear it escaped Milner too)
but we have happy ending with
Rico in disarray and retreat and all
the kids from Steve’s school jiving
to the Four Tops explaining “Ain’t
No Woman Like the One I Got.”

So why do I ﬁnd the play in

general, but more speciﬁcally the _

Nixon version produced and
directed by Woodie King so
unsatisfactory? Well, it is partly
Milner’s fault. Rico is such a

magniﬁcent creation, a superb and '

deeply intellectual Mephistophel-
es———at least in the dramatic
script. 2 ,
Rico has to be the entity around
which all productions must center.
But this is the reason for the play’s
inevitable structural failure. Under
King's direction, Lewis plays Rico
with energy and style. He must

have been practicing the pimp’s '

wide-legged stance for weeks. At
each entry adorned, or rather
entrapped by even more fantastic
accoutrements, his presence trig-
gered an overwhelming, wave of
enthusiasm from the black audi-
ence. They enjoyed his style, his

coolness’ It seemed

that they were not listening to him
and they were not encouraged to.
King allows the script to become
secondary as Rico postures and
swaggers without a hint of
desperation.

whelmed by the beauty of the
music. Simplistic piano chords
,soon led into a livelier, more
difficult interpretation.

Finally the cello entered warily

into the cycle ‘until after’ several‘

false starts the drama. in the piece
emerged in the effects of Starker.
Soon musical lines became lighter
as dancelike, melodious ideas
permeated the work.

Then tragedy was expressed
until that sentiment died out also to
make way for brighter tunes which
sounded like remnants of European
folk dances.

Sprinklings of runs and intricate
ﬁngering designs rounded off the
piece.

After intermission Starker re-
turned to solo with Sonata for
Unaccompanied Cello, Opus 8 by
This very modern piece

the entire concert. Abrupt string
crossings interspersed with pizzi-
cato identiﬁed the ﬁrst part of the
work as unique rather than
dissonant. No set melody or
rhythm characterized this ﬁrst part
also a tendency to be frantic to the
point of desperation.

the absolutely highest pitch Starker-

could squeeze from the strings. v

The use of the wood of the bow also
seemed to play an essential role in
the message of the composer.
Starker almost didn’t make it in
the various changings of position
required here but soon made up for
this in his great technique. He
spared nothing in his ﬁerce attacks,
his gallops up the scale, and his
spider-like hand movements.
Eager, skipping chord progres-
sions,
crossings and ﬁngers that move
faster than the speed of sound
prodded me to think of him as Mr.
Magic Fingers. He astonished the
audience and at the end of the

piece had them screaming for ‘

more. The crowd settled down for
a brief encore, then had to let him

go.
