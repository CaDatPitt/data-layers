To Present
Rainmaker

“Theater In Round”
Production, Opens
Tomorrow Evening '

The Pitt Players’ current,
show, “The Rainmaker” by N.
Richard Nash, will be pre-

sented on Thursday, Friday _

and Saturday in Stephen

F o s t e r Memorial. Curtain_ 

time for the play, which will be

produced in the round, is 8:30 p.m..
Tickets may be purchased, at the
Student Desk. '

A special performance will be
presented this evening for junior
women and their parents. It also
will begin ‘at 8:30 p.m. in the
Stephen Foster Memorial. A social
hour for students and parents
will follow this performance.

1 “The/Rainmaker” was very fav-
orably'reviewed by the New York
critics when it ran on Broadway
during the 1954-55 ‘season. Brooks
Atkinson of the “New York
Times” described it as “A lusty
antic in a popular comedy vein.”
Because of its stage success it was’

— later made into a movie“.

'1‘ h e Players’ ' performance,
which is under the direction of
Michael J. 'McHale, will star,
Alicia Komich as Lizzie, a prarie
wallﬂovver who is resigned to
spinsterhood despite the ‘bumb-_
ling efforts ’_of her father and

_ brothers to find suitors for her.

Herb Margolis will playthe fa-
ther; Steve‘ Gordon and ‘Donald
Marcom, the two brothers.

Lizzie’s spinsterhood is'not the
only problem existing- on,‘ the
ranch. A long-existing drought has
made the area almost unfarmable.
But when Tom Hall, in the title
role, shows up, promising to bring
rain to the parched land, the an-
swers to both the suitor and the
rain deﬁciencies seems imminent.-

Hall, a roving eon-man with
a gift for fast_talk, teaches Liz-
zie to appreciate the beauties of
everyday_lif\e and makesit pos-
sible for her to. ﬁnd happiness-—
and a husband. When rain does ‘
come, much to his surprise,
everyone’s problems are solved
and the traditional “happy end.-
ing” can be accomplished. _,

Students May Have.
To Buy Ducafs
For Six 1959 Games

Three members of ‘Men’s
Council executive committee,
were accused of not doing
their jobs and students were
threatened with the possibil-
ity of no more free entr_ance

to football games, Monday at the
Student Government Association
meeting.

Denis Lichtman, Council presi-
dent, chargcd that Chief Justice
Randy Marlicr. Arts ’59; Vice
President Bill Kaliden, Arts ’59;
and Treasurer Stanley Franzos,

—Bus. Ad. '59. were not fulfilling

their duties. This was in answer
to charges made by the Pitt News
that Men’s Council was not per-
forming any useful service to the
school and therc‘tore should be '
abolished.

According to Lichtman. these
men accepted their positions with-
out considering the fact that their ~
participation in, other activities
might hinder their work in the’
Council.

Can’t Recall Officers

Because there is no provision
for recall of officers in the MC
constitution, he said, these men
must hold their offices for the
duration of the term. The presi-
dent explaincd that the Council

cause no other body can create

policy pertaining solely to men

students. . ' I
John L. Sullivan. Arts ’59, an-
nounced that the Athletic De-
partment is considering issuing
season;tickets at two dollars per
game to students for the. 1959
football season, thus eliminating
entrance by identiﬁcation and
activity cards. ~ ~ .

This would be done in an at
tempt to correct the misuse of
these cards practiced by students
in past years. There are six home
games scheduled for next year. ,

Radio Recognized

I The SGA "officially recognized
the Student Broadcasting Associa-
tion and granted SBA $175 out of
its $200 fund for new student or-
ganizations.

President Bert O’Malley de-
scribed the recognition and grant
as “the most important action SGA
has taken this year.” '

Lichtman later presented the
ﬁnal report' of the Auditing
Committee. _The committee de-
cided in favor of free auditing.
They expressed the belief that
such a system would improve
the _,educa,tional atmosphere of
the University, increase ’ the:

It is expected that the new food
service facilities will be available
to students and staffs of the schools
of the health- professions within
30 to 60 days.

Presbyterian Hospital has en-
gaged Management Food Service
Inc., a subsidiary of StoufTer’s
Restaurants, to manage the dietary
operation using the present hos-
pital employees.

Initially, a transistional period
of operation will result prior to '
M.F.S. assuming entire control
of food production. '

Eventually the managerial skills
of Management Food Service will
employ their dietetic training pro-
gram, own recipes, and the bene-
ﬁts of volume buying.‘

Cafeteria dining facilities are
located in the wing connecting the

Building to Presbyterian Hos-

Hi Darlin’. . . *

Remember last time I said I felt
a. lecture coming on? Well, sweet,
hang on to your purple yarn pig-
tai1s—here it is! Don’t.you dare
NOT read on; it won't hurt a bit.
.You’l1 thank me for it yet-or at
least you'll thank Juliette Marglen!

Remember I was talking about
your poor chipped and broken
nails? Well, Dorothy at the beauty
shop tells me she has the most won-
derful solution—or rather, ‘Juliette -
Marglen has . . . a special formula.
for “problem" nails (which is an
understatement as far as yours are
concerned!) and it does sound
simply marvelous. It's made espe-
cially f or .“stubbies” like yours! She
says you can type or sculpt-any-.
thing—al1 you want and still have
lovely nails!

The secret, it seems, is in two
preparations called JeweZBase and
Jewel.S'eal—and you wear them
always. For nails as fragile as
yours, you add protective coats of
Jewelseal every other day or so.

Well, my good deed for today is
that I'm sending you a set of
Juliette Marglen’s JewelBase and
Jewelseal, which you are to use
according to directions in the little
booklet . . . and if you do, I promise
you not only a bottle of Cellini
Bronze _Nai1 Glacé to match your
Oval Lipstick—but a complete set
of every oneiof those divine J uliette_
Marglen artist's colours! Oh, the
things we mothers have to contrive
-to bribe their oﬂspring into doing
something for their own good!

Here comes Jimmy . . . I'can hear
him though he's still a block away.
More later. love now . . .

T|1eBes’r|nves’rmen’r- 

_ By Lorraine Lesoon .
In line with all the great improvements withi
the University, the administration here at Pitt is
backward in the aspect of increasing faculty
salaries. I ' '_ . .
With the new administration came, a faculty
increa‘se'of 10%, but-this, as ‘one '
professor, has said, “is just

He added: “While other- col-
leges’ and universities are im-
proving -the status of faculty
members, Pitt is at a standstill:

Editor, The Pitt News:

I was graduated‘from the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh last June
and still remain inthe academic
ﬁeld, so perhaps a few reflections
on my experience relative to the
University of Pittsburgh_may be
worthwhile. V
' First, I must say that I hope
my experienc_e has given me the
good judgment to prevent me
from ever being bitter, bombas-
tic, or unreasohable.

I have observed two complete-.
ly different administrations at

To overcome this problem, en-
gineershave devised a reproduc-
ing system in which the sound
is picked up through two micro-
phones, and the two channels
thus derived arebikept separate
right through the loudspeakers

other institution that wishes to improve, Pitt too
muststart at the foundation. This foundation is, I
think, the faculty.

In regard to the administrative conduct of af- »

fairs. one professor explained how his requests and
those of fellow faculty members were handled. I
couldn’t' help comparing his _description with one
that appeared in the article entitled “Academic
Bureaucracy” by John  Academesis in-- theeOct.

12 issue of the New York Times which I could not’

overlook _because of the profound similarity. Ada-

’ demesis said (at the risk of being repititious):
_ Bureaucracy at Work
‘ F;-. “When the lowly professor has a need, he com-

,mu,nica_tes this_ to his department chairman, who
in turn presents the matter to one of the deans;

- will present it to the‘ main dean. This dean then

hies, himself to the next stage in the ‘hierarchy of

C-command, and so it goes until the level of deci-

sionris reached.” ‘ _. '
Several remarks made by some of Pitt’s out-

standing professors are summarizedby Academesis

when he said, .“I have often wondered\‘ in recent

‘I years what my request ‘sounded like when it
' reached the ﬁnal level of decision.” .-

I’ll admit the dividends will not be tangible in_

a monetary ‘sense like most of Pitt’s investments,
but then it is not money_ alone that makes for a
university's greatness. _ ’ ‘

It is the men and women who teach and mold
the thoughtsiof its students where the hope and

-possible ‘realization of greatness’ lies. We have

learned through the simple stimulus—response re-
lationship _that without continual or intermittant
reinforcements, a response soon extinguishes. Such
may be the case" with. the faculty’s initiative and
effort which may remain static if the administra-
tion does not move and move fast.

Cats Oppose Buckeyes
After Michigan Setback

The Panther basketball team opens its home season to-
night at the Field House when they entertain the Buckeyes
of Ohio State. The opening tipoff is listed for 8:30 p.m. The
Panther freshmen will meet the Bethany Reserves in the

preliminary tilt at 6:15.

The Panthers dropped their opener Monday night in
Ann Arbor, Mich., to the Big Ten’s_% - "

A Wolverines, 75-55.

Ohio State leads in the series
with 13 wins in 21 tries. The
Blue and Gold will start three
seniors, one junior, and one sopho-
more. As usual, Skyscraper U. will
rely on All-American Don Hennon
to do the bulk of the "scoring.

Bob Timmons, who is starting
his sixth year as head basket-
'ball coach of the Jungle Cats,
plans to start John Mesher, a
senior from Donora, at the other
guard slot opposite Hennon.

John Fridley, sophomore from
Sharon, and Dave Sawyer, senior
from Mt. Morris, N.Y., will be the
forwards. Francis Konrad, a junior

  
   

LAR USTON '
Big Buckeye Threat

from Bentleyville‘, will be at cen-
ter. Konrad is a transfer student
from Citrus Junior College
California. Timmons’ sixth "and
seventh players are John Mills and
Ron Maser, respectively.

Maser, an unheralded sopho-
more from McKeesport, has sur-
prised Timmons to a large extent.
“Maser has-moved up from the
third team and is now my seventh
man,” declared the Blue and Gold
tutor. “He is also a strong re-
bounderpand ﬁne shooter,” added
Timmons.

The starting lineup for‘ Ohio
State shows Dick Furry (6-6)
and Joe Roberts (6-5) at the
forward positions, Larry Huston
(6-7) is at center while the
gtfard slots are held down by
Joe Carlson (5-11) and Larry,
Siegfried (6-3). Huston, is the top-
scoring threat.

As was expected, the 5-81/2
Hennon was the Panthers’ only
ammunition against M i c h i g a n

 . Monday night. He scored more

than half the locals’ points, 28, on
ten ﬁeld goals and eight of nine
free throws. The only other Pan-
ther in double ﬁgures was Fridley
with 13 points on six ﬁelders and
a free toss. ,, A
The Panthers got off to a quick
5-1 lead, but soon relinquished it
to a fast-breaking Wolverine ﬁve.
At halftime the 5,400 fans saw
Michigan with a substantial mar-
gin, 40-23. In the ﬁrst_ 20 minutes
the hosts hit on 40.5 per cent of
their shots from the floor while
the Panthers Icould sink only a
poor 24.5 per cent of their tries
The Panthers gave the Wol-
verines a closer ﬁght in the
second half, but passing errors
and inadequate ﬂoor play hin-
dered them from.catching the
victors. '
John Tidwell, a 6-3 sophomore,
led Michigan with 22 points.

Breakstone Finishes With 13-2

Soph Haggerty Tops Coaches
As Prize Yogi Prognosticator

Larry Haggerty, a mere youth
in the ranks, has won the 1958
.Yogi title. The sophomore, who
succeeded the coaches as the prize
prognosticator, held ﬁrst place
every week except the ﬁrst when
theesthetic Beano Cook started
the season with a blast.

The combination of the players
managed to eke out a second-
place ﬁnish over their tutors, the
coaches.

Fourth position in the predic-

tion spotlight went to Murray

Chass after a ﬁerce struggle with
Millard Amdur. With only two
games remaining on last week’s
chart, the two were all tied in
knots. But then the Air Force

downed Colorado and Notre Dame
defeated .USC, two games that
Chass had chosen correctly and
Amdur had chosen incorrectly.
David Breakstone brought up
the rear but gained some distinc-
tion with his 13-2 record last
week, the best anyone did all year.
And then there are the Yogae,
who incidentally bowed out in
a ﬁtting manner. Lynne (I like
that team so I’ll pick the other)
Munro led the trio last week
with a 10-5 mark but neverthe-
less placed third for the season.
Joanne (Misty) Dolinar was the
best of the Yogae while Patricia

“Well, Al, it just Wasn’t the kind of "day I would like to
give thanks for. First of all, when I woke up the thermometer
was only hitting the 15 degree mark; this was about seven
in the morning. I was just about to pull the shade down and
roll over again for a coupla hours when I suddenly remem-

5 bered that there’s two games to see. - -

Yeah, you were with me on Sunday when that Yates
' fellow said that the Pitt News was going to take on the news-
paper boys from Penn State in the morning-. I watched..some
of those loony games the radio and T.V. guys put on at
Forbes Field, so I ﬁgured that the college boys might be good
for a few laughs. _. -

It was plenty cold driving in on 30 and I was thinking
that anyone who had to play football in that weather was to
be pitied. The boys -had started to warm up when I got to the
Ellsworth stadium. I noticed that not too many; fans had’
showed up, but the ones there were obviously for.State.

The Pitt News Hawks, that’s what they called themselves
I think, were wearingthese old red jerseys; Some fellow
standing there told me, quiet-like, that they couldn’t get blue
and gold from their own athletic department. Imagine! Being
as how I am superstitious I decided that the Hawks would ;
not fly high, what with the wrong jerseys on.

Anyhow, these Cowards from State did not look that way
at all to me, unpreparedsl mean. First of all, they were about
our age—-23, 24. Then the same little guy told me--that they
were mostly vets and other kids just working‘ their'“way
through schools. Hard as nails. The State boys won the toss
and elected to 'receive,_nat’urally. This kid ‘for the Hawks’ got
a bad kick oiT,but a short guy ‘for the Cowards got his glasses
knocked off and he fumbled the ball. The Hawks_ fell on it
and really.went wild—like it was a miracle or something.

happily shouted that he ran the Pitt News. Shy, I guess you’d
call him. The Hawks got nowhere _with threeplays, even
though they had recovered on the State 10 yard line. So on

fourth and still goal, they decided to pass. . ., .

This little blond kid, who seemed to be running the
whole-show with yelling and such," takes the ball on a roll-out
like Tonc_ic and tosses it. The pass was high and short. A tall,
shifty boy from State jumps up, snares it, and moves out like‘
a souped-up T-bird. Not a’Hawk near him the whole length

, of the ﬁeld. Bang; 6-0, just like that. Uh huh," 26—zero was the
ﬁnal count, like -it said in the Press. , \ ' '

That sameshifty characterran like a- maniac all morn-‘
ing, even with the cold and all. The guy who runs the News
said that this kid was faster than Haley. But I don’t know
. . . Haley gets a pretty quick jump. . .

Taken by Shrine

4 To Late Trustee

The Babcock Room, occupy-
ing the entire 40th ﬂoor of the
Cathedral, was dedicated last
Week in brief ceremonies as

aiimemorial to the late E. V.
Babcock, civic leader and
long-time friend of the University.

Made possible by a bequest from
Mr. Babcock and by a gift from
his widow, Mary Arnold Babcock,
"the room will be used for meet-
ings of the University Board of

“ _Trustees and for other important it it

educational meetings.

The square shape of the room is
modiﬁed by four alcoves, in one
of which hangs a portrait of Mr.
Babcock by Malcolm Parcell. -Set
in the alcoves are broad windows
offering a" view of the University

campus, the Golden Triangle, and .

much of Allegheny County;

‘Son Presents Room
‘After introductory remarks by
Chancellor Litchﬁeld, the room
—was formally presented to the‘
University by Fred W. Babcock,
son of the donors. William P. Sny-
der Jr., acting president of the
Board of Trustees, accepted the
gift. The dedicatory prayer was

j offered by Rev. Howard C. Scharfe. .

The Babcock Room is designed
and furnished in contemporary
style. ‘The walls are paneled in ‘
Appalachian white oak with
hurled walnut inlays and touches ‘
"of rosewood. The floor is cov-
ered with blue carpeting, at the
center of which is the University
seal encircled by a gold-colored
band. __ ’ ’

Indirect" lighting is recessed in a
domed ce.‘_ing. A large octagonal
table seating 36 persons occupies
the center of the room. From the
room there is access by stairs to
the roof of the Cathedral, where
there is an open—air promenade.

Former University Trustee

Babcock was a University trustee
for 39 years, serving from 1909

until his death in 1948. ‘ A gener-

' ous contributor to the fund for

construction of the Cathedral, he
lent his ﬁnancial support, leader-
ship, and prestige toward advanc-
ing causes to the beneﬁt of the
University.
He also was a civic leader

 

who isn't at exarn time? But the
dog days will soon be over and
(so they tell us) a new era awaits. ,

When that breathing spell comes,
maybe you should take a glance at
the future. Have you given much
thought to financial planning?
Probably not. That's why we sug-
