p By TRUDY WEISS ,
In his annual“‘state of the University” address, Chan-

i . "“ cellor Edward H. Litchﬁeld cited the trimester plan as a way
A of satisfying today’s need for. a more economical use of time.
“There is a particular problem facing us and all institutes

of higherlearning,” the Chancellor said, “the need for a new

national work habit.”

Referring speciﬁcally to condi-6‘

tions here in the University, he
said !‘this is an internal matter
reflected in trimester.”
, Trimester Meets Need
’ Trimester, important in itself, as
"'7 Dr. Litchﬁeld pointed out, is also
,1 “one of the ways through which
we are searching for new re-
sources in the competition for sur-
Vival.”
This statement came. after
a reminder that Mr. Krush-
chev, while visiting this
cimpus one year ago invNovem-
ber warned us “we’ll catch up
to you, and we’ll“ pass you by
/- and wave to you.”

As it has been demonstrated by
Russia in successive progress in
most ﬁelds, there exists today keen
competition for survival. This
competition was a motivating rea-
son for the trimester plan, the
Chancellor pointed out.

In summing up the reasons for

was not to meet a budget, nor to

Trimester Successful
As to the success of the tri-
mester, Dr. Litchﬁelcl said, "‘The
experience has been happier than
we expected:” *
“Sixty-four per cent of the
faculty participated; their pay
was increased by one-third. We
have 110 new faculty people, all
of whom were informed of the
trimester calendar.”
He indicated that the‘ trimester

even had some influence in bring-

ing more faculty members to the
University.
Little Overlap
Dr. Litchﬁeld commented that
without eliminations there are
fewer overlapping of courses.
“There is a new consciousness
of the need for a systematic re-
organization of courses,” he said.

n Regis ion

Students can look for improve-
ments in registration in the next
few. years, according to Mr.
Richard Hodges, director of Stu-
dent Records.

A new invoice form will be used
for the winter registration. In-
cluded on it will be a space for
all scholarships and loans that the
student will have for the coming
term. This will enable all students
except those who desire deferred
payment to register through the
mail.

Registration will begin today
and wil extend to Nov. 23. All
students who register after this
period will be charged a late fee.

Students Responsible

"‘All students are urged to make
use of the Time Schedule which
will, be available today before
meeting with their adviser,” said
Hodges. He emphasized, “It is the

Popularized, classical music is pre-
sented for thousands of young
people from pre-school to college

taste of classical music.

Karl Kritz will be conducting

‘his sixth season of music this year.

last Thursday. _

Rodger Yeager, ‘John LaRosa,

Fulton next turned to the
United States “loss of prestige”
reflected by Bi-azil’s contact with
Cuba. He refreshed the audi-
ence on certain political prac-
tices of Harry Truman.

During one of his campaign
speeches in an area where there
was a left-winged party, Truman
was' quoted as admitting that he
and Stalin were “pretty good bud-
dies.” Fulton said.

Students Alerted

“Don’t take what occurs in a

Students from the audience

Democratic Panel Questions Fulton ‘Beer Gives Answer

T o Nuclear Problem

, By CHUCK DUNBAR.
,Dr. Samuel Beer gave foul‘ answers for the nuclear arms
problem at the initial program of the PM series in the SU

Ballroom.

Dr. Beer, national chairman of Americans for Democratic
Action, opened his talk by stating the “special character”
of his problem. He denied the situation as the “need to strike

instantly with full force, and thee

ability of the other side to retal-
iate immediately.”

“Chances of accidental war are
increased,” he said, “because of
this emphasis on a force of being,
which is ready to go into action.”

As an answer to the problem,
Dr. Beer outlined “four approach-
es to the danger.” These four dif-
ferent views are the positions tak-
en by governmental leaders and
other students of the arms race.

Problem Answered

The first answer is what he
called “the doctrine of deter-
rents,” which can be explained
by the simple statement “if you
use your weapons, we’ll use
ours.” This is the existing con-
dition in the world today where
both Russia and the U.S. are in
a position to threaten each other
with nuclear attack.

Dr. Beer felt his second ap-
proach should be called “the doc-
trine victory in the cold war.”
“This is not the exercising of
vigorous political influence, but
the use of military superiority to

roll back the Iron Curtain, he‘

explained.
Submission Favored

Plan three is the “doctrine of
unilateral nuclear disarmament.”
Under this plan one side would
disarm in hopes that submission
would be better than annihilation.
According to Dr. Beer this idea
has been met with much favor in
Europe.

The fourth approach is the
one suggested by Dr. Beer him-
self. “The doctrine of deterrents
for the sake of negotiation” is
his answer to arms race. Both
countries would maintain both
nuclear and conventional weap-
ons. «

The essential difference from

‘the other plans is that these weap-

ons would be used “not for vic-
tory in the cold war, but as a
shield to stabilize and reduce
dangers of war.”

Dr. Beer added, “This doctrine
makes the assumption that the
Russian leaders are rational, and
that they realize war is not to
anyone’s advantage. Therefore
they can be brought to an arms
control agreement.”

sity had expected to take a loss,
or at best to break even. Actual
returns, however, showed a $400,-

ﬁeld these profits are an indica-
tion of the ‘great interest taken in
the trimester as shown by greater

evenings and Saturdays

Dr. Litchﬁeld predicted that by

of our role as the innovator of the
trimester system, which will by
then most likely be considered the

contributions from alumni and b t thod "
other sources. . es me '
The trimester increased po- 9

tential working time from 65 to
100 days for those University
students who did not attend the
spring term. This in turn de-
creased the number of working
students in the fall term of 1960
by 50 per cent.

Of the students who took the
fullest advantage of the trimester
in its first year, several interest-
ing statistics were revealed in the
Chancellor’s address.

Students in the professions pre-
ferred to attend more so than
those in the non professional cur-
ricula.

Students Work Hard

Men were more interested than
women, older students In or e
than younger. In addition, stu-
dents in the third trimester were
generally those from the lower in-
come groups, and were the harder
working type but only average in
ability.

Chancellor Litchﬁeld advo-
cates new, additional programs
for maximizing our resources.

senate for a probe into the mat-

  (on vacation Correction

Chancellor Litchﬁeld, in his Fall Convocation address
last week, pointed out the need for better utilization of fac-
ulty members’ time. Too often, he said, faculty members
must perform routine clerical work, and thus lose time
which could be spent in academic pursuits.

He went on to make another point, a rather disturbing

by students who interrupt the work of professors. The im-
.plication of this statement, many students seemed to feel,
was that time spent by faculty members with students out-
side the classroom is time lost.

 

The professor is here to teach the student, whether in

sponsibility of the student, but guiding and assisting him in
his learning is the responsibility of the professor. Many
times this can be done best outside the classroom by per-
soqal conferences, informal seminars, or even over a cup
ofcoffee.

‘Thereis a trend in many universities to emphasize the
need for faculty members to do research, advise business
.- ﬁrms, assist government programs, and write books.

These pursuits are, of course, a necessary function of a
university, for through them the outside world increases its
knowledge. In addition, these projects can_bring prestige
and funds to a university and often are the basis of faculty
promotions.

But what does the students do when teaching is rele-
gated to a minor task of the university?

Fortunately, the situation at Pitt has not developed to
the extreme to which it has developed in some schools. '
‘But students should not be asked not to interrupt the
more important work of faculty members. If a student
'needs academic guidance from a professor, the professor
hasaao more important task.

Tuck‘ Shop: Selglregiationi  . *

, By Ina Amdur ‘ j

The Tuck Shop has just been redecorated so
that it no longer resembles a subterranean dun-
geon. The walls, are beige, and the tables have
new formica tops. Yet there is still something
wrong with the Tuck Shop that
the administration cannot‘-repair‘-§
They cannot dispose of fraterni-
ties and sororities which cater
only to particular races and on-ly
to particular religions. ‘Only the
students who belong to these
groups can modify this outdated
tradition. ‘

As long as fraternities and
sororities c~ not include as po-
tential members all university
students, regardless of religion?
or race, they have no place on auniversity ‘campus.
However, as long as they do exist, the fraternities
and sororities should operate as democratically as
possible. The only excuse that any segregated fra-
ternal orgarization can legitimately offer is that
their ritual wolves a religious oath which not all
students would be willing to take. Other than this,
there W01 seem to be no legitimate excuse for
any kind of segregation.

Self-inflicted Harm

When a fraternal organization is segregated, ‘the
members who belong to it are not gaining as.much
from it‘ as they would if it were not restricted. If
different religions and races mixed,‘ all members
would learn to understand different cultural tradi-
tions and religious ideals. Unanimity breeds in-
tolerance, while multiplicity can breed understand-
ing -and respect. .

Whether or not ,there are bias clauses in the
national charters of specific organizations is irrele-
vant. There are bias clauses in the minds of the
members of these restricted groups. The only way
to prove that this is not so is by rushing anyone

Twofold Socia

By Jim Vaughan
During his first year in college, the freshman
develops social habits that have an important in-
fluence on the rest of his life.

vs

He comes to college with strong basic needs to ‘T

be liked, accepted, and esteemed
by others. But he isn’t very
skillful at satisfying them. He.
looks" aroundpand sees that there
are many other students -
usually upperclassmen —— who
have the same needs, yet, who
are much more skilled in satis-
fying them. He sees them as be-
ing more witty, conﬁdgnt, and
uninhibited than _he. .
His social needs are, thus,
twofold. He wants to be “ac-
cepted, “etc.” and he wants to improve his skills in
satisfying these basic needs. O
From some people, the freshman gets the advice
to study now, and play later. From others, he

' hears that he must have “leisure” or rest because

he studies hard. Both groups are wrong. For they
do not understand the great signiﬁcance of social
needs. If the freshman is not to be miserable all
his life he must spend a considerable amount of
time satisfying his present needs, and learning to
satisfy his needs more adequately in the future.

The' time the freshman spends with others
(away from his books) is not so important in de-
termining the course of his life as is the habits and
thought patterns he acquires from the people with
whom he spends that time.

In attempting to satisfy his social needs, the
freshman usually attaches himself to a particular
circle of people. Their regular meeting place may
be in the Tuck Shop, Student Union Lounge, a
dorm room, or an activities office.

If he chooses a circle composed largely of idiots,
he is destined for mediocrity even though “he is
intelligent. To be sure, he will satisfy his social
needs adequately with these people. But at what
a cost! He will come to acquire the standards of
intellect, motivation,’ and sophistication of people

I destined to succeed in becoming $70 per week clerks
And technicians.
Subtle Protective Process
It’s a subtle process by which he becomes a
fool like the rest of the crowd.‘ To have fun with
‘ them he must be accepted by them. And to be
accepted involves conforming to their ways. It is
in conforming to their talk, dress, activities (in
general, their behavior) that he automatically

' adopts» the values and attitudes of the group. This
‘ ‘ . .enta1‘adapf.at,i 2 ‘fa

  
 
   

' tective  that cases

Eliminate Dl§crimination

wwho is personally appealing to the membership of

  

 

 

the fraternity or sorority. It is unbelievable that
members of other religions are automatically unap-
pealing to the members of certain organizations.
-If this is true, it is the result of uncritical thinking,
and the members should examine their beliefs.
The existence of segregated fraternities and
sororities on a university campus denies the very
principles for which a university stands. There is
‘a ﬂickering light of truth on our university seal
which is in danger of being extinguished by those

who have no regard for its ﬂame. A university-

should be the stronghold of liberal and enlightened
minds. If there is prejudice here, tolerance cannot
be expected to exist anywhere. .

We are not even close to a social utopia in this

country. Every time a fraternity or sorority re--

fuses to rush a student because of his race or re-
ligion, we recede one step from the attainment of
this utopia. Maybe some day we will be so far
away from it that the goal will no longer be in
sight and consequently will be forgotten.

It is strongly suggested that"all fraternities and
sororities take the necessary steps to make their
groups nonrestrictive both racially and religiously.
It is true that tolerance cannot be legislated, from
the _outside, but there. is no reason why it cannot
be discussed from the inside. If there are national
charters which gontain bias clauses, then the Pitt
chapters should write to the national office peti-
tioning a change. If there are no bias clauses then
the custom which dictates bigotry should be in:
vestigated. In either case changes should be made
which guarantee equal rights to all.

Until the segregated fraternities and sororities '

change their policies, a blight will remain at the
university of which none can be very proud. One
of the tasks of any human being is the lessening

‘of the injustice in the world. There is no better‘

place to start than here, and no better time to
start than now.

Needs

Most of the supposedly well-adjusted College-
Joes in many collegiate circles fit in well with their
own group and types of groups. But if measured
by real, mature, intelligent standards, they lack
self-discipline and have a poor conception of how .
their time and energies should be spent. They

cannot bear being alone or to rely on themselves ,'

for entertainment. And they are incapable of criti-
cal, independent, and imaginative thought. By the ~«
time they graduate, if” they do graduate, their
minds are crippled permanently. ”

The freshman who attaches himself to such»:
group cannot. help getting caught up by their medi-
ocrity. In choosing persons to identify and asso-
ciate with, the freshman who wants to do himself
justice in life must not look just for security and
satisfaction, but for a chance to develop emotion-
ally and intellectually.

Depending on how and with whom the fresh-

man satisfies his twofold social needs, he helps or v:_,

hinders the development of his sense of values,
work and_ play habitsfsénse of values, methods of‘
solving problems, etc.

Unless his social needs are so strong that he is
"compelled to be with others constantly, in which
case he is lost, he must be careful to avoid at-
taching himself too closely to any group. For in
identifying intimately with a group whose thinking
habits he adopts automatically, he loses his real
self.

He fails to consider that he is an individual, a
person with a unique personality that distinguishes
him from all other people. If he conforms closely
to the standards of a group, he not only rids him-
self of undesirable aspects of his personality, but
he buries much of his desirable uniqueness.

The intelligent freshman whospends only a
minimum amount of time satisfying his social,

needs, while spending a maximum amount irnprov-iv

ing his‘mind, will prepare for himself the richest
fullest life possible. And he will be developing‘.
values and habits which will enable him to fit in
with “real” people. '

Those people who shine in graduate school and
in later years are ones who spend much of their
undergraduate time in preparing their minds; they
do not pursue social needs indiscriminantly. And
they are neither recluses nor social bugs.

The freshman with any abilities should stop and
think for a second. In the two decades from 1970
to 1990, the present student generation will replace
the older generation in the ﬁelds of music, art,

"letters, politics, science, medicine, education, busi-

ness, etc. It’s up to‘ him now, if it is not already
too, late, to decide whether. he  going to be 015;;

more) when he joined Paciﬁc Telephone. One of

Stu contacted 12 other companies before join-

Panthers Pound West

Win May Be Costly
As Injuries Pile Up

By JACK SMITH

The Panthers’ 42-0 lacing

of West Virginia was as easy

as taking candy from a baby, but it may have been costly.
From the opening quarter when Woody Hazer recover-

ed a tumble on the Mountaineer 26-yard line, and the Pan-

thers quickly scored on a 12-yard pass to Bob Clemens, it

was evident the Cat’s offense
ﬁrst time all season.

The Panthers rolled up their
largest margin of victory over
West Virginia since 1904, and did
it with about as much ease as -it
takes for a referee to drop a pen-
alty flag. But in the process they
lost the services of two left half-
backs.

Tarasi Out

Ray Tarasi, 175 pound scatback,
intercepted a pitchout in the sec-
ond quarter and scampered 26-
yards for a touchdown. But min-
utes later Tarasi broke his right
arm while making a tackle.

He is one of the Panther’s bet-
ter defensive backs. Although
only in the game for a short
time,‘ Tarasi scored a touchdown
and picked up 23 yards in two
carries. He will be lost for the
remainder of the season.

Chuck Reinhold pulled a ham
string and may not see action for
two games. Jim Cunningham,
spent the enitre game in the hos-
pital with the flu. Cunningham
also had been bothered all week
by a sore knee.

Slaby Shines

-Sophomore Lou Slaby started at
fullback and turned in more than
an adequate performance as he
racked up 20 yards in ﬁve carries.
"Slaby did a ﬁne job ﬁlling in for
Cunningham,” Bob Clemens said.

Once again Clemens could af-
ford to throw bouquets to his
teammates for he was the game’s
leading ground gainer picking
up 74 yards in seven carries.
Clemens scored two touchdowns:
one on a 12-yard pass from Jim
Traficant and another on a 16-
yard scamper off right guard.

This was the ﬁrst time all sea-
son the offense had a chance to
shine. They took advantage of it.

Trafficant continued to run the;

team with ﬁnesse as he scored
once and threw touchdown passes

to both Clemens and End Mike;

Ditka.
Plays Best Game
“I-Ie’s improving with every
game,” Coach John Michelosen

said. “Traﬁcant is learning fast.”
Ditka had hisbest game this

 

was ready to explode for the

A
7

year as he caught three passes
for 58 yards and one touchdown.
He’s a great receiver,” Traficant
said. “If it was up to me I’d
throw to him 50 times a game.
He’s an All-American.”

Third string Fullback Mike
Frasca also got into the scoring
act as he broke off left tackle for
40—yards and the touchdown that
‘gave the Panthers their 42-0 vic-
' tory.

Subs Star

Andy Kasic, John Chisdak, Ed
Clark, Carmen Ronca and Ed
Ferdinand all showed offense and
defensive ability as the Panthers

continued to move in the second
thalf. Both Ferdinand and Kasic
‘intercepted Mountaineer passes.
“These boys have to get their
experience some time,” Michelo-
sen said. “They did a ﬁne job
and whenever we get the op-
portunity to play them, we will.”
Statistically the Panther over-
whelmed West Virginia. The Pan-
thers picked up 20 ﬁrst downs to
the Mounties ﬁve. In total yardage
gained the Panthers racked up
400 yards to West Virginia‘s 140.

By JOHN FLEMING
The booters are stll trying
to ﬁgure out whathappened
Saturday when they were
trampled by Akron 8-0 in a
one-sided contest Saturday on
the Practice Field.
It seemed as though a blitz
struck. Akron began their parade
of goals early in the ﬁrst quarter
and did not let up until the ﬁnal
lgun sounded. This certainly wasn’t
 the same team that fought Michi-
igan State to a scoreless tie for an

Worst Defeat

This is one of the worst defeats
that the Blue and Gold has ever
suffered in soccer. The team is
out for revenge and may ﬁnd just
that when they meet St. Louis

lnext Saturday. The Cats will not
lbe in top shape as injuries will
again hinder their efforts.

The injury plague has struck
again! This week’s victim is
fullback Ron Prado. Prado is in
the hospital suffering from an
infected leg. The infection set
in on the cut that Proda received
when he crashed into the goal in
the Ohio University game.

The booter spectators are begin-
ning to wonder what the ﬁrst

team for the Panthers has not
been able to play in top form
since the ﬁrst game.

Ray Tarasi Gets
Chance to Play,

Breaks Arm ,

By TED COLTON ‘
_, Sports Editor ' g

 

Marquette was trailing Pitt, 21-15, with less than six seconds to
go in the ball game. They had the ball on the Panthers’ 20 yard line.
Quarterback Pete Hall of Marquette went back to pass and sighted

iTim Zhulkie in the end zone.

Hall, a deadly passer, sent what looked like the game winning

2 pass spiraling into the air. Just before the pigskin reached its destina-

tion a desperately leaping Pitt defender 
reached Zhulkie just in time to safely
break up the pass and save the game
for the Golden Panthers. The name of

the Panther back who saved the Blue
and Gold from the humiliation of being
upset by a team which they were favored
to beat by more than two touchdown was
Ray Tarasi.

Last Saturday Tarasi scored the ﬁrst
touchdown of his collegiate career and
seconds later found himself with a frac-
tured arm and out of action for the rest A
of the season. TARASI
, Ray Tarasi, 5-10, 176-pound halfback from Harmarville
might havl: had a brilliant career as a Panther halfback but due
to mysterious circumstances and now this injury he may never

claim the glory that might have been his.

  
   

After his game-saving play against Marquette, Tarasi disappear-
ed from the lineup. Against USC, the Panthers’ next game, Tarasi saw
limited action. He carried the ball one time and gained ﬁve yards.

From then to the end of the season, Tarasi sat on the bench.
There was no official explanation why he was there, he just didn’t
play. One rumor was that Tarasi was in Coach John Michelosen’s
doghouse because of breaking training rules. The story was that he
and two other ball players, who weren’t demoted to the bench, were
reported out late one night, and Tarasi was put on the third team.

There is where he stayed up to Saturday’s game with West Vir-
ginia, even though he had sparkled in the pre-season drills.

Tarasi did appearifor a few plays in the Cats home opener
when Michigan State was desperately trying to break the 7-7
tie late in the last quarter. Michelosen must have felt that Tarasi’s
ability was sufficient to trust him in a situation that could give
the Panthers their second loss of the early season.

Many of Tarasi‘s teammates felt that Ray was receiving a raw
real and that he was one of the better backs, both offensively and
defensively, on the team.

Tarasi ﬁnally got his chance in Saturday’s homecoming
game; and he took full advantage of it. In two offensive plays
he gained 23 yards. In the second quarter he picked off a Moun-
taineer lateral and raced 26 yards for the TD.

On the ensuing kickoff he was the ﬁrst one down the ﬁeld and
made the tackle byihimself. Butunfortunately two unidentiﬁed Pan-
thers piled on the ball carrier after he was on theground. As a re-
sult Tarasi suffered a fracture of his right forearm.

Many of the spectators who saw Tarasi in action Saturday said he
looked like one of the Panthers best backs. But fate has played a
strange part in Ray Tarasi’s athletic career, and we may never know
if Ray would have reached stardom. On the bright side of the pic-
ture. he does have one more year of eligibility left.

If he stays out of Michelosen’s doghouse, and his arm heals, he

, may yet prove that he can play football.

Cats Lose‘

By JIM 0’BRIEN 5

Bob Tarkany pulled a surprise upset in the cross-country
meet with West Virginia on Saturday afternoon but the
Mountain harriers proved more at home in the hills, nipping
the Panthers, 27-28.

A Tarkany chose a good day to perform his heroics, for
his dad and high school coach traveled from Rockaway, Ohio

to see him. ‘ 9

Following the plucky Tarkany
across the ﬁnish line were three
Mountaineers: Spelsberg. Rea and
Badwi-n. The winning time was
23:37 —— 58 seconds slower than
the winning time in the Penn
State meet. Tarkany wassixth in
that meet.

Reed Clarke Harry Stokes and-
Bill Hinchberger ﬁnished in‘the
ﬁfth, sixth and seventh positions.
Vance Carter, John Towne and
John Hart came in 9th, 11th and

Coach Carl Rees looked as

trick on him. He yelped, “Man

“I ‘left their runnner at the be-
ginning of the last hill. He hesi-
tated at a turn in the past and I
cut quickly and opened up a ﬁve
yard lead, which he never closed.
His coach yelled, ‘kick Spelsberg,’
and I ran a little harder and he
never caught me.”

He gave an indication of the
slow pace when he added, “Har-

he was toying with them at ﬁrst.

The yogae this week seem-
ed to have slowed down their
hot pursuit of the leader Jack F‘!
(Scoop) Smith with many up-
sets only three of the yogae
had winning slates. 4,

Scoop led everyone with a 9-4 V“
record this week to strengthen his
lead. Many feel that he has inside
information. Joanne (S p e e d y)
Dolinar slipped back into a second
place tie with the player. Speedy
had a 6-7 record while the player,
Fritz Walker, compiled a 7-6 slate
to move up into the tie.

M a r s h all Romeo, whose
Yankees lost the World Series,
had one of his better weeks with
an 8-5 record. He said, “I want
to pass both the player and ,,
make a pass at the girl. I also, Vi"
want to catch Smith.”

Consensus continued his mas-‘
tery over the coach and Ted Col- -3-
ton by compiling a 6-7 record.
Consensus, while not moving up in
the standings, has control of the
lower half. Each time the coach or
Colton tries to move up, Consen-
sus put on a spurt and stays in
the ﬁfth spot.

The coaches fared no better this
week as Old Man Upset hit with
regularity. Bimbo Cecconi could

As a sophomore, the 202 pound¢
guard saw only ﬁfteen minutes of
action. Last season he played the
equivalent of two full games. As
a senior he has blossomed into a
star and leads the Panthers on de-
tense with most tackles made.

Not Very Heavy

Actually 202 pounds is not heavy
for a lineman, but Hodge makes
up for his size in speed and ability
to diagnose plays. As middle
linebacker, Hodge says he can tell
from the way a play starts where
a back will run.

“With the position I play, I
guess I should be making the
most tackles,” Hodge said. “I
just feel that I’m doing my job.
I’m not satisﬁed with what I
have obtained, I want to im-
prove just as I want the team
to improve.”

Hodge believes the Panthers
could win the rest of “their games
this year. “I think we can if we
play the way We’re capable of
playing,” Hodge said.

Product of Portage

Hodge is a product of Portage
High School, between Johnstown
and Altoona. For three consecu-
tiv‘e years he lettered in football,
baseball and track.

One of the primary reasons
he came to Pitt was the Pan-
ther’s football schedule. “It was
my home school,” Hodge said,
“also I wanted a degree that
m e a n t something.” Football
coach Steve Petro is given credit
for enticing Hodge to Pitt.

“I liked the way he talked,”
Hodge related. “He was always
truthful and willing to any ques-
tion I had. These things are im-
portant when a kid is thinking of
going to college.” i

Majoring in Business
Hodge is majoring in business \
and hopes to go into marketing
after graduation. His other inter-
ests include baseball and ﬁshing

This advantage also applies to
students who would prefer tak-

securing a class at the wanted
hour,” assured Hodges.

Hodges asked that all students
be sure that their names, address-
es and courses selected are correct
on the course election card. He
added, “When the student signs
his name on the registration form,
he is signing a contract which
should be correct.”

At Gen Tel, we've made a running start toward solving
many of tomorrow's communications problems.

For instance, scientists at General Telephone & Eleo-
tronics Laboratories are working in the uncharted area
of the spectrum where radio waves take on the character-
istics of light. They have already developed an experi-
mental ultramicrowave system that may one day make
possible the transmission of two million messages on

 

   

a single radio beam in free space.

As a major communications company with world-wide
connections, General Telephone is helping to advance
the science of total communications around the globe.

Our stepped-upresearch in the basic sciences is but
one example of the way General Telephone & Electronics
combines the talents of many people and the facilities
of many companies to meet the future communications
needs not only of America. but the whole world.
