‘Freshman Plot
Fails; Bonfire
Fixzzles

A Freshmen revolt failed to
materialize yesterday for lack of
leaders. Rumors had it that the
grumbling Frosh were planning
to burn their dinks on the ODK
Walk Thursday morning. This
sacred portion of the school's
hallowed grounds is strictly
off limits for the Freshmen.

First indication of the dis-
content was heard Wednesday
aftemoon when the rumors started.
By Thursday morning most of the
Freshmen had heard of the plans.
Also aware of the revolution were
very influential members of Men’s
Council, who harried hither and
‘you in an attempt to squelch this
ursurption of then authority.
Apparently their appeals and/or
threats carried weight, when the
rally time rolled around, the only

Stadium. That it further strongly
recommend that the University take
appropriate action to protect its
students from the unwarranted con-
duct of an inconsiderate minority."

In the discussion that followed
approval of the resolution, Don
Ewart suggested that some means
be provided to insure that no in-
toxicants are brought into the Stad-
ium. It was also suggested that
additional city police be utilized to
patrol the stands during games, but
nothing definite was decided upon.

It looked for a time as though
Congress was to get a big boost in
its efforts to rid the Stadium oi
"drinking and rowdyism.”

Student Action Asked

Earlier, Captain Tom Hamilton,
director of athletics, told Congress’
Decorum Committee Chairman Andy
Schurman that, "if necessary, a
student vigilance committee would
be appointed to police the Stadium.”a
However, when questioned later,
Capt. Hamilton said the students’
conduct at the games was their own
responsiblity, and that for the sake

World Events

During the temporary shutdown of the~city's daily newspapers
the News will print a column of news bulletins from world, natio-
nal, and local sources. Although such items must be gathered
the evening before publication dates, we feel that they will aid
in a small way the filling of the news vacuum created by the
shutdown. This service is only temporary, and will be terminat-
ed when the city papers resume publication.

WASHINGTON, Oct. 6 -- John L. Lewis yesterday said that if Presi-
dent Truman appointed him dog catcher there would be more brains in
the dog department than in the State Department. Lewis made the com-
ment in retort to a letter made public that the president had written to a
Colorado state senator a year ago. The president had said, "For your
information, I wouldn't appoint John L. Lewis dog catcher.-”

TOKYO, OCT. 6 - The United Nations forces in Korea yesterday
amassed an estimated 150,000 troops near the 38th parallel for a fi-
nal aliout drive on the North Korean Communists. The drive is expected
to begin within the next few days. Meanwhile the Communists worked
against time to set up a defense line on the west coast just north of the
38111 parallel.

ATLANTIC CITY , NJ. Oct. 6 -- The CIO United Steel Workers
yesterday formally agreed to ask for a general wage increase and other
changes in their contract from the steel industry. The Wage Policy Com-
mittee, however, did not outline its forthcoming demands.

DETROIT, OCT. 6 - Wildcat strikers at the Ford Company rolling
mill here were warned yesterday that serious disciplinary action would
be taken unless they ended their foil’-.'day strike. The company also
charged that the strike was a violation of the CIO United Auto Workers
contract with the company. So far 50 per cent of the workers have re-
turned to their jobs reducing the possibility that a general tieup of the
Ford system would result.

COSHOCTON, 0., Oct. 6 - The Coshocton county prosecutor yester-
day had not decided whether he would ask a grand jury to Consider the
case of W.E. Eller, engineer of the "spirit of St. Louis.” The crack
passenger train had plowed into the rear of a standing troop train last
month killing 33 Pennsylvania National Guardsmen.

SANTA FE. N.M., OCT. 6 - A nude woman was the subject of a
bitter forensic battle yesterday between a group of clergymen and
artists. The nude is a has relief called “Miss Fertility" which was
placed over an annex of the state capitol. The artists accused the
ministers of making a moral issue over the nude because of their
“ignorance of art.” The debate ended with the nude still brooding over
the capitol and a decision of her fate still up in the air.

VIENNA, AUSTRIA, Oct. 6 - Austria yesterday accused the Soviet
Union of supporting the Communist-inspired riots which have crippled
the transportation system in the Austrian Soviet zone. The government
filed its complaint - with representatives of the four powers: U.S.,
Great Britain, France, and Russia. According to reports the Communists
have so far failed in their attempt to paralyize the tiny country.

STATE COLLEGE, PA., OCT. 6 — Penn State's new president,
Milton S. Eisenhower, yesterday called for a militarily and economi-
cally strong American. Speaking at his inaugural address the new
college head declared that a strong America is the world's “greatest
guarantee of peace and freedom."

Mr. Eisenhower's inaugural was witnessed by over 50 other college
heads, including his famous brother. General Dwight D. Eisenhower who
is president of Columbia University.

of their own reputations they should
conduct themselves in an orderly
manner.

He said also that the decision to
take any positive action on the
matter was entirely in the hands of
the board of deans.

In a session that was kept mov-
ing only by the constant prodding
of Pres. Howard Greenberger, Con-

gress also‘ attempted to elect a
senior representative to replace
Clinton H. Lowery. A deadlock

developed between candidates Earl
Jacobs and Harry Green, however,
and it was decided to postpone the
election until next week's meeting,
when it is hoped that those members
who were absent will be on hard to
break the tie. .

Mrxonic Invited

Emil MrKonic, Pitt's self-styled
Green Hornet, also came in for some
lively discussion by Congress’
members. A resolution, introduced
by Andy Schurman, to invite Mrkonic
to the next meeting "to clarify his
position” was approved imanimously.
When asked to comment on this
development, Mr. MtKonic said he
had “nothing for the News.”

,Four Hours Off
For Pep Rallies

Four one-hour class periods will
be dismissed during the fall sem-
ester for pre and post game football
rallies by a decision recently handed
down by the undergraduate deans.

The deans recently approved this
plan which was requested by Student
Congress to dismiss classes at
rally time in the College, Business
Administration, Engineering and
Mines, Education. Freshmen and
sophomores in the School of Phar-
macy will be dismissed .also.

One fourth and one fifth-hour per-
iod will be excused on Fridays for
pre-game rallies, and one second
and one third hour on Mondays will
be available for assemblies after
"significant” victories.

The classes preceding the hours
chosen for the rallies will be short-
ened by fifteen minutes.

Student Congress, together with
the offices of the dean of men and
dean ofwomen, will select the speci-
fic dates for the rallies.

This is a minor increase in ap-
proved dismissal of classes for
rallies over last year, according to

ND Train Trip
Near Sell-Out

Although accommodations for the
Panther-Irish Special have been in-
creased to 700, a complete sell-
out is expected by to-night.

Due to a large demand for tickets,
400 more were obtained and put on
sale at the start of the week. Even
with the additional tickets, many
prospective ticket purchasers will
proba bly have to be turned down,
salesmen estimate.

One reason for the rapid sell-
out has been the alumni support
accorded the expedition. They will
fill more than half the train when
it leaves the P. and L. E. station
at 11:30 p.m. Friday, Nov. 10.

The Pitt band which has already
scheduled two trips, one to North-
western and the other to Ohio
State, will not be able to travel
to Notre Dame with the special
train.

Viers Adams Appointed
Head of Planning Board

by Jack'Markowitz
Viers Adams has spent a large part of the last six weeks

boning up on his civil defense.

Appointed by Chancellor Fitzgerald in mid-August to head
the Universityfs civil defense program, Mr. Adams is handling
the new duties in addition to those he has as clirfctor of Ells-

worth Center.

"We are trying to brief ourselves
on our responsibilities in provid-
ing for the protection of life and
property at the University,” Mr.
Adams says of the program up to
now.

“Our objective is to set up an
to provide for that
protection,” he said.

The need for some such organi-
zation is apparent, Mr. Adams said.
Should an air raid ever happen,
casualties, according to a govern-
ment _bulletin, can be reduced by
50 per cent if an efficient civil
defense program is functioning.

I'n order. to achieve a well-
ordered program, the University

and other large organizations
throughout the country have
applied to Washington for
literature outlining government

recommendations along this line.

The University, Mr. Adams said,
will probably shape its organiza-
tion as closely as possible to that
proposed by the National Security
Resources Board in a recent pu-
blication, "United States Civil
Defense.”

Only concrete s.eps taken so
far has been the obtaining of esti-
mates on certain equipment which
would be bought if an emergency
developed.

The University, as a unit in the
civildefense set-up, will fall un-
der the jurisdiction of the Alle-
gheny- County and Pennsylvania
programs.

Richard K. Mellon, a member of
the board of trustees of the Univer-

sity, is the head of the Military and
Civil Defense Commission of
Pennsylvania.

Other University personnel asso-
ciated with civil defense outside
the school are: Dr. Thomas Parran,
dean of the Graduate school of
Public Health, who is head of the
Pittsburgh public health unit; Dr.
William S. McEllroy, dean of the
School of Medicine, with the Alle-
gheny County medical care unit;
and William H. Ray, research asso-
ciate in School of Public Health,
who is a member of one of the four
radiological teams in the county.

Psych Playroom Aids Child Study”

3)’ ISABEL LUBOVSKY

A little corner room on the six-
teenth floor looks very much like
the toy department of a downtown
store. It is, the psychology depart-
ment’s new play therapy room.

The playroom consists of a doll
house, wall shelves and a table
each piled highwith everything from
a teddy bear to a tin rifle. Gay cur-

tains on the windows add a bright

touch to the atmosphere.

Children are recommended to the
psychology department for study by
schools. Physicians, and social
agencies. After a child is thoroughly
tested he is put in the playroom
where he can be watched and heard
at play.

Used for Education

While being interviewed, Dr.
Jack Matthews and Dr. Aron D. Laz-
ovik, both assistant professors of
psychology, who use room for in-
struction, stressed the fact that the
purpose of the room was not to act
primarily as a treatment center. Its
purpose

clinical psychology, they said.

An interesting feature of the
room is ‘a two way mirror which
enables faculty members and stu-
dents to observe a child without
his knowledge. There are three such
observation chambers. A

Another valuable item is a buil

where the observer can hear what

Foreign Magnates Send Sons Here

By DAVE WINTER

Two young British citizens, one the son of a titled depart-
-mait store magnate, are selling men’s socks arid Hopalong Cas-
sidy outfits as part of their schooling at Pitt.

John Burbidge comes to Pitt’s Research Bureau for Retail
Training from London, England. His father, Sir Richard Burbidge,
is managing director of Harrod’s, England’s biggest deparmtnet

store, located
Circus.

Jerome Pollock, son of a Cana-
dian super-market owner, hails from
"Canada’s Pittsburgh” - Hamilton,
Quebec.

Both men are working in a down-
town department «store Mondays and
Saturdays.

Soft-talking Burbidge says people
keep asking him if he’s Scotch.
They know he’ isn’t American, but

near Piccadilly

they don’t recognize his broad “A”

accent as English.

English department stores are
much like the American variety, he
says. Instead of big warehouse-
size floors, though, they contain
many little specialty stores -
shops - within-a-shop.”

Burbidge is a graduate of Rugby,
an English prep school. He saw his
first American football game last
week, and says the game is "much
slower” than the British Rugby
football he played in school. “We
don’t have so many substitutes,”

he explains.

After leaving Rugby, he spent a
year and a half in England and
Tripoli, North Africa, with a tank
regiment under England's post-war
compulsory training.

"American food is much better
than ours,” john says, and he’s
decided he likes the U.S.A., too.

“There’s a friendlier atmosphere
here. The people talk more, and
are not so self-contained.”

Canada has no TV stations.

things, with the exception of a few
dolls whose arms and legs come
off. Dr. Lazovick explained that
these were sometimes used by child-
ren to display any hostile feeling
they might have towards people in
their environment.

Connected to this room is another
small room which also has a two
way mirror. This is used by faculty
members for observing graduate
student's techniques in interview-
ing or testing, as well as the dyna-

,mics of group behavior.

an excellent idea of the effects of
TV. Hopalong Cassidy suits are
one of his fastest-moving items.

A number of mothers have con-
fided that they don’t dare go home
without one of the outfits. He is
amazed because “so many mothers
seem to let the children have the
upper hand.”

Big-city Canadian super markets
like his father’s handle even more
items than our streamlined groce-
ries. The Canadian shopper can
also buy stockings, pots and pans,
and oodles of housewares.

Students from 18 states are in-
cluded in the Retail Training
School's 1950 class, evidence of
its national fame. The presence of
these two British students, both
sons of retailers prominent in their
fields, indicates its reputation
extends well outside our national
boundaries.

The Men’s Debate Association will operate under a revised

system for the 1950-51 season.

Members with previous experience have been divided into

ﬁtwo groups, the varsity and junior varsity. A third group, the

It was pointed out by Bernard McGowan, manager of Men’s

Debate that no squad is a set
group. .,

Varsity men may be dropped to
the jayvee squad or novices may
be promoted to the varsity squad,
depending on their ability as de-

organization.
Following the novice squad idea
the executive committee will also

Med School Discrimination?

By MYRON KOPELMAN

-XXXX-

Student Congress this week passed one of the most construc-
tive pieces of legislation in its recent history, a resolution to
ban drinking in Pitt Stadium. Unfortunately, Congress, whose
authority is strictly limited in the few areas where it is defined,
can do no more than ask the board of deans to take action on the
measure, so that the resolution, worthy as it may be, serves only
to point up the fact that the so-called ‘voice of the students’ is
still little more than a debating society.

II#* ##II

As for the issue itself, drinking in the stadium has always
been more or less present at football games, and has been on the
increase during the years in which the student body has been
composed largely on the veteran age group.

Last year, the fact that drinking in the stadium carried more
danger than the doubtful moral factor was pointed up by the case
in which a coed was injured seriously by a bottle hurled by an
allegedly intoxicated student.

It is doubtful that anything would have come of the incident
if the News had ‘not published the story and printed an editorial
on the subject. As it is, the first positive step to be taken came
this week, a year_ after the incident.

While we don't intend to pass judgment on the morals of the
student body, especially at such a traditionally enthusiastic
affair as a football game, we agree with Congress that the Uni-
versity should take a stand on the subject, either eliminating
drinking altogether, or providing more careful supervision of it
in the student section of the stadium.

tilt #II#

It would be even better if the entire code on the subject were
reviewed, although the problem may not be so pressing now that
the age level_of the student body is dropping.

It is certainly inconsistent to allow intoxicants to be carried
to a University function on University property, a's has been done
with regard to football games, and on the other hand, forbid
drinking at a semi-private function such as an Interfraternity Ball.

If we must be inconsistent, it would be far better, from our

— personal viewpoint, if the situation were reversed.

It is interesting - but only

American people is better than
ever,” beams Dr. Donald G. Ander-
son, secretary of the AMA Council
an MedicalEducation and Hospitals.

Apparently, the AMA is more in-
zerested in producing quantity than
quality. For this highly influential
body has hardly gone out of its
way to get the most qualified pre-
rned students into medical schools.

Discrimination Rampant

Racial, religious, and nationality
discrimination continues to prevail
in enrollment practices, and has, as
a matter of tact, gained momentum in
recent years. Possibly the man
potentially capable of finding the

interesting -- to note that the

American Medical Assn. is radiating optimism over the present
state of the med school enrollment picture.

The AMA boasts that medical schools last year broke all
records by enrolling moi'e students than ever before. "The out-
look for graduation of more doctors to safeguard the health of the

By ALLAN BIERMAN

The scene is a peaceful, sleeping
Economics 1 class. The professor
is droning away about capitalism
versus communism, sub-marginal
production and the broken window
theory and how it applies to broken
windows.

The tranquillity of the slumber-
ing class is disturbed by a loud
knocking. "Open up in the name of
the law,” a booming voice author-
itatively cries.

Fourteen policemen rush into the
room with drawn guns. (The city
can't afford real ones.)

“Okay,” the lieutenant ‘in
charge of the racket squad says,
"everybody line up against the
wall. This is a raid.”

 

The Lieutenant continues, "One
at a time I want you to come up to
the table and empty the contents of

your pockets thereon. Everything
else too."

A plainclothesman, pad and pen-
cil in hand, makes a list of the art-
icles as they are deposited on the
table.

"One pen and pencil, three sam-
ple packs of cigarettes, one marble,
notes from basketweaving, one foot-

Overset

By BOB THOMAS

- bird, the artist no doubt a follower

Some Pitt profs try to be funny; some try not to be. But every
now and then one puts his foot in clear up to the knee and you
just can't help laughing.

One of the last species is a red-faced air force instructor in
the ROTC Department, He was emphasizing the importance of
strict, accurate definition to his attentive class. In the course

“but that was long before I was
born.”

Much Ado About Miscellany De-

properly National Letter Writing

nal scene from Oct. 15 to 21. The

fine psychology to the cadets and
it came out:

In one of my classrooms the back

Silver Threads Among the Gold
Department: Ever-young English
prof Edwin Peterson feels that he
is getting old and tells this tale
to prove it:

While calling the role in the first
meeting of a Victorian Writers
Class one year he came across a
familiar name.

“Didn’t I meet your mother
once?" he asked the sweet young
lady who answered.

"Sure you did,”

' of Rube Goldberg, is this: she replied.

Post Office publicity release on
the "week” says this is the
"thirteenth observance of this
meritorious annual event”.

So now we have a week celebrat-
ing letter writers.

With weeks to prevent fires, be
kind to animals, keep your feet
healthy, stay safe, watch your
child’s welfare, produce better
dairy cows, and be good to your
neighbors the average person is

I can think of nothing we need
more than a week celebrating wri-
ters of letters unless it would be a

quickie honoring America's cram-

ped-fingered writers of numbers.

cure for cancer is selling shoes
today because he lacked the blue
blood to get into med school.

The situation is tragic not only
for the rejected students but for
members of all creed and color. Can-
cer does not discriminate. It will
strike a Daughter of the American
Revolution as quickly as it will
strike a greenhorn fresh off the
boat.

Unjust Inquiries?

Whether the Pitt med school dis-
criminates, I do not know. But it
is a fact that the Pitt application
for enrollment inquires about 1'9-CC:

father's birthplace, mother's maiden
name, and applicant's church.

True, such information can be put
to just and useful purposes. Yet it
has been almost three years since
President Truman's Commission
on Higher Education asked why such
information could not be gotten after
the students are enrolled.

Not Unreasonable

Certainly the Commission's ques-
tion is not unreasonable. If Pitt
does not discriminate, and is anx-
ious to prove that it does not, then
why the reluctance to follow the
Commission’s advice?

The University is a recipient of
state appropriations. All races and
religions pay state taxes. On that
basis, it seems fair to ask Dean
William McEllroy to revise his ap-
plication forms.

Exchange Desk

What with Tom Hamilton's phys-
ed-for-the-masses proposal, interest
these days is pretty strong on the
subject. But Pitt isn't the only
place where worry over flabby
upperclassmen prevails.

As reported in the Muhlenberg
Weekly of Muhlenberg College in
Allentown, their athletic depart-
ment is interested in the problem
too. They've formed the Committee
for Communicating Calisthenics to
Co-operative Collegians to do some-
thing about it.

This body (for euphony, the
CCCCC), offers a list of corrective

exercises for jangled juniors and
and somnambulent seniors. One
goes like this:

“While standing on both feet

with the knees bent at a 53 degree
angle (be sure the angle is exactly
53 degrees) place the right hand on
the right heel, and any other hands
in your pockets. Revolve the body
in a clock-wise motion (never
counter clock-wise until the right
ear points to the Library dome. Then
bend forward from the waist until
the forehead scrapes the .floor.
Stand erect and repeat 48 times. If
you should work up a sweat while
doing this exercise cool off before
any open refrigerator while sipping
the juice of one ice cube.”

The opinion hereabouts is that
any character who'd try that one

would end up a cross between a
broken pretzel and registration red
tape.

From the home of the bean and the
cod comes an earnest plea for more
open book exams. A Boston U.
columnist argues that, this being
the age of the textbook, we should
know how to use them to solve prob‘
lems rather that reflect a lot of
quickly forgotten facts back to the
exam sheet.

It seems to me that Pitt, long
proclaimed a factory, should do
some reorganizing along that line. ~
If Liberal Education is teaching us
how_ to think, wouldn't open book
quizes give better training for just
that? Or does the product of an_
assembly line always come out per-
fect? Maybe its just that objective
tests are easier to mark.

Here's a new wrinkle, this time
erased from the student’s brow. The
college faculty at Adelphi College,
N.Y. has approved an unlimited
cuts system starting this fall.

There's a draw- back: only Dean's
List prodigies of 2.5 QPA’s and up
are beneficiaries. Any tests or work
missed, unless through illness or
other unavoidable causes, cannot
be made up, but still, what a way
to earn a sheepskin!

not being found by the Phi Gams as
yet.

The opening touchdown came as
the Phi Gams got their first break
by intercepting3,a pass. They then
clicked, and passed their way to a
score.

Intercepted passes became -the
trend of the game thereafter, the
Phi Gams doing it three more times,
and following up with a TD each
time.

The Sig Eps were having a little
trouble getting anything going. It
seemed that in addition to the mag-
net the Gammas seemed to have on
the ball, Sig Ep recievers had ten
thumbs. The only results of their
passes were disgusted grunts and
sour faces.

The Sigma Phis did show some
life in the second half when they
broke through the Phi Gam defense
and blocked a kick. This resulted
in their only score.

Charley Yost, who was injured

It was a tough break for the

Yost is now hospitalized to re-

2nd Meet

With one victory under their belts
the Pitt cross country teamjourneys
to Slippery Rock tomorrow to meet
an untested Slippery ‘Rock squad.

Coach Carl Olson, well pleased
with the showing of his varsity in
last Saturday's meet, is planning on
using the same thinclads in tomor-
row’s contest. Th ey are Ken Mahari-
na, Bernie Luterancik, Bob Pastor-
ius, Jack McMahon, Dick Worrell,
Ed Carnegie, and Ed Bierman.

A few of the more promising fresh-
men runners will participate in the
meet but will not count in the final
scoring.

Last year Slippery Rock was the
only team to defeat the Panthers in
dual competition. As a result Olson
has been practicing his barriers ex-
tna hard this week. During these
practice sessions Luterancik and
Mahanna have shown steady improve-
ment. Much will depend on these
two boys if Pitt is to come close to
winning.

But Opposing Coaches

Face Similar Problems

By STAN SKIRBOLL

Almost identical problems will face rival coaches Len Casa-
nova of Pittsburgh and Wes Fesler of Ohio State when their foot-
ball squads face each other at Columbus tomorrow.

Both mentors have lost their initial contest, both teams have
a good line, both teams have an inexperienced backfield, both

teams have a poor pass defense.

But the Buckeyes overshadow
the Panthers when it comes to
showing off an ‘
offense. Although
Fesler’s men
bowed to South-
ern Methodist
last week, they
still rolled up
enough yardage
along the ground
and over the air-
lines to make
the Panthers a%
two touchdown ’
underdog tomor-
row.

OSU racked up 249 yards rush-
ing and 186 passing, while Pitt
rushed for 76 yards rushing and
passed for 46.

OSU Line Rough

Enemy passing, however,
brought about the downfall of both
the Panthers and Buckeyes. The
Ohio boys could not stop the pass-
es of SMU’s Freddie Benners,
while Pitt was defenseless against
the heaves of Billy Cox.

The Pitt ground attack will run
into trouble tomorrow if it en-
counters the same type of opposi-
tion the Buckeyes threw against
SMU. Fesler’s line held the Mus-
tangs to a minus seven yards, one
reason why SMU decided to go over-
head.

Fesler had Janowicz calling

The tires on your car right now may
have cords of Cordura* High Tenac-
ity Rayon yarn. If so, you beneﬁt
from one of the most important con-
tributions that Du Pont scientists
have made through the years to the
automotive industry.

“Cordura” High Tenacity Rayon
is comparable to structural steel in
tensile strength. It makes possible
tires that are at once lighter, stronger

and safer than pre-war tires. Unlike ~

natural ﬁbers, the qualities of this
product of chemical science are al-
ways uniform.

UNDIES TO TIRES

I At ﬁrst, rayon was used mainly in
making articles of clothing. However,
with an improved tire cord in mind,
Du Pont scientists set out to produce
a tougher rayon than any previously

known. The problem was given to a-

skilled team whose members included
organic, physical and analytical
chemists, physicists, and chemical
and mechanical engineers.

One of their first discoveries was
that strength could be increased by
using cotton linters as the source of
cellulose, in place of wood pulp. It
was found, also, that the viscose solu-
tion had to be prepared and handled
with extreme care. Perhaps the most
important lesson was one which the
silkworm had taught centuries be-
fore: stretching increases strength. The
Du Pont experimenters stretched the
new yarn and made rayon with a ten-
sile strength of about 70,000 pounds
to the square inch—-more than twice
the strength of textile rayon then
being produced.

TRIED AND PROVED
With the cooperation of tire manu-

V-belts of "Cordura" and rubber keep even

facturers, "Cordura” was tested in
heavy-duty tires on baking-hot des-
ert roads. During the war it proved
itself on command cars, trucks and
jeeps. Today, rayon-cord tires are
widely used. on trucks and buses,
and leading manufacturers use
Du Pont "Cordura” in tires they
make for passenger cars.

The combination of lightness and
strength offered by “Cordura” has
also earned it a welcome from makers
of conveyor belts, V-belts and hose
for domestic, agricultural and indus-
trial uses. It is used to reinforce lam-
inated kraft paper, to tie wires to
electrical switchboards and as a chain
warp in carpets to bind the wool
tufts ﬁrmly in place. One of the
newest uses is in plastic clotheslines.
The Du Pont Company makes none
of these articles. But because
Du Pont scientists had an idea and
the facilities and funds to develop
it, many businesses can now offer you
better products to make life safer and

more enjoyable.
