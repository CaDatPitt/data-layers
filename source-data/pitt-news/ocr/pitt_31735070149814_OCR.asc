Anal sts

  hesitate
to call  

primaries

_By Kelly Lyons
Staﬁ" Writer

Political analysts Richard Bene-
detto and Jessica Taylor shared
the same reaction to Republican
presidential candidate Newt Gin-
grich’s victory in South Carolina:
They were bafﬂed. I
The nomination season re-
mains highly contested this
year — with three states’ votes
counted, three different Repub-

lican candidates ‘can each claim V

a victory. , And Benedetto and
Taylor are‘-hesit-ant, tolpredict a
primary-election outcome. B

Benedetto expects that if
Gingrich takes victory in the
next primary in Florida on Jan.
31, Romney may lose his front-
runner status. _

“The whole race got thrown
a big surprise by South Carolina
because nobody expected Newt
Gingrich to win,” Benedetto said
of the primary election where the
former house speaker took 40.4
percent ofvotes.

Benedetto, a political reporter
for USA Today, and Taylor, ase-
nior analyst and reporter at The
Rothenberg Political Report, dis-
cussed the four 2012 Republican
presidential candidates during a
conference call Tuesday.

Joseph Starrs, director of the
Ins_titute on Politicaljournalism,
an internship and education pro-
gram based-in Washington, D.C.,
hosted Tuesday’s call, which was
aimed at students and included
participants from Pittsburgh to
Florida to Sydney, Australia.

Mitt Romney, former Massa-
chusetts governor, came in sec-
ond place in the South Carolina
primary with 27.8 percent of the
vote. He won in New Hampshire
and came in a close second in the
Iowa caucuses.

ollegiate Readership Program to return  

On Friday the Board will vote to immediately reinstate the program or wait for locked drop boxes.

By Michael Ringling
Staﬂ" Writer

After a three—week hiatus, copies A
of’The New York Times and USA
Today could return to campus as
soon as next week. ‘

In a 6-2 vote, Pitt’s Student
Government. Board ' approved
the reinstatement of the Colle-
giate Readership Program Tues-
day night, after the Board voted
during winter break to halt the
newspaper distribution. Board
members Alex Murdoch and
Halim Genus voted against the
reinstatement.

“We will support the -exten-
sion of the readership program
by advertising. and educating all
fellow students on the perks of

the program,” Board President
James Landreneau said prior to
the vote. “We will monitor the
activity of the program and of-
fer our support for future Boards
with their decision on making this
program permanent.”

On Friday, the Board will vote
to either resume the program im-
mediately or wait between ﬁve
and six weeks for the installment
of locked drop boxes which would
restrict access to the papers to
non-College of General Studies
undergraduate students.

The Board had brieﬂy halted
the program because of difficul-
ties with barring other students,
faculty and Pittsburgh residents
who do not pay the Student Ac-
tivities Fee from taking papers. In
September of 2010, the SGB mem-
bers that year approved $30,500

of the Student Activities Fund to
cover the cost of the program.

If the Board votes for immedi-
ate resumption of the Collegiate
Readership Program, Landreneau
said that the newspapers will
return to their original stands
within two weeks. __

An Interfraternity Council

allocations request also spurred -

discussion among Board mem-
bers in Nordy’s Place.

In a 5-3 vote, the Board ap-

proved an allocations request to
fund catering at the President’s
Conference onJan. 28 — an event
for the president, vice president
and an emerging leader from each
Pitt fraternity and sorority recog-
nized by the IFC.

IFC requested $3,491.30, for
food and supplies, but the Alloca-
tions Committee recommended

that the Board deny the request
in full because they did not feel
that the food would enhance the
conference and the supplies were
undocumented.

The Board approved $2,891.30
and denied $600 for undocu-
mented supplies after a motion
by Genus to fund the purchase
of food.

Board members Olivia Arm-
strong, Genus, Gordon Loud-
erback, Megan. McGrath and
Murdoch voted to approve the
motion, andJulie Hallinan, Nata-
lie Rothenberger and Zoe Sam-
udzi voted to deny it. Murdoch
abstained from the second vote
because he will attend the confer-
ence as a representative for Sigma
Alpha Mu.

President ﬂhfamtalk ecomy i t we

Obamatouts economic success and job creationxin his address Tuesday night.

By Gideon Bradshaw
For The Pitt News

In what could be his second-to—last
last State of the Union address,
President Barack Obama all but
hung a banner that read “America
is Back.”

The Pitt College Democrats
who gathered in 1501 Posvar Hall
to watch the speech enthusiasti-
cally laughed and cheered at sev-
eral points during the address.

Obama focused on economic
issues in his yearly address to con-
gress. He said it was a priority of
his to prevent a tax hike for 160
million middle—class Americans,
who he said are already struggling.
He went on to say that he would
end the tax cuts for the wealthi-
est 2 percent of Americans, who
he said are costing the nation $1
trillion every year.

“Now, you can call this class

warfare all you want. But asking
a billionaire to pay at least as
much as his secretary in taxes?
Most Americans would call that
common sense,” he said.

He also brought up what he
considered some of his foreign
policy successes, such as the
killing of Osama bin-Laden and
the full withdraw of U.S. combat
forces from Iraq. ‘

Energy’ was an issue as well.
Obama said that while domestic
U.S. oil production was the highest
it has been in the last eight years
and consumption of oil is the low-
est it has been in the last 16 years,
it was important for the nation
to use its natural gas resources
and to develop clean, alternative
energy means.

Concerning domestic issues,
Obama said that his administra-
tion has made American indus-
try stronger, stating that General
Motors, which was on the brink

of failure when he took office, is
stronger than'ever-today.

-Obama credited this success to
federal assistance for which his
administration campaigned. In
exchange, the White House de-
manded accountability from au-
tomotive manufacturers. Because
of the recovery, he said the entire
industry has created 160,000
jobs.

Rick Hill, the public relations

director for Pitt’s College Republi-

cans, was skeptical about Obama’s
claims that his measures are suc-
ceeding. Hill pointed to the na-
tional unemployment rate, which
is at' 8.5 percent.

“We have yet to hear any con-
crete plan to get America on top,”
Hill said. “Whereas [Obama] said
we’re alreadylback on top.”

Hill felt that despite the rheto-
ric, rather than creating a climate
in which the American economy
could grow, Obama’s policies still

focus on increasing government

and making it harder for busi-V '
‘ nesses to create jobs.

During his address, Obama also
proposed ending tax breaks for
companies that outsourced jobs.
Instead of subsidizing these com-
panies, he said, he intends to cre-
ate incentives for companies that
bring jobs back into the country;

The president also discussed a
goal he set two years ago to double
American exports over the follow-
ing ﬁve years, saying that trade
agreements he had signed were
helping to open new markets for
American products.

Lara Sullivan, president of the
Pitt College Democrats, organized
the viewing of the address in Pos-
var Hall last night. Sullivan’s re-
action to Obama’s remarks was
optimistic. “He deﬁnitely empha-
sized the fact that [members of
the middle classes] are the ones
who deserve the tax break, not the

millionaires,” Sullivan said.
Sullivan also enjoyed other
measures Obama said would
help working Americans, such as
his exhortation to Congress not
to‘ raise interest rates on college
loans injuly. ‘
“Higher educatio’n can’t be a
luxury — it’s an economic imper-
ative that every family in America
should be able to afford,” Obama
said. _
Additionally, Obama said that
U.S. troops had stopped ﬁghting
-in Iraq after nine years, and that
10,000 U.S. troops have returned
from Afghanistan. The president
said he would bring another

’ '23,000 home by the end of the

summer.

He also said that the world
had joined with the U.S. to pre-
vent Iran from gaining nuclear
weapons, and that world leaders’
sanctions were crippling Iran’s
government. '

it comes to the upcoming elections.

is that he came too late [to the race] ,” Tay-

$23 per person for food.

The Allocations Manual does not men-
tion the amount of money that designated
Student Affairs Afﬁliated Groups can re-
ceive for food.

V Patrick Coppler, the President of IFC
and a representative from Delta Tau Delta,
said he approved of the Board’s decision.

“They seemed very interested in what

"we wanted to do,” Coppler said.

Additionally, Landreneau said that

the Board did not attend last weekend’s
Pennsylvania Association of State—Related
Students conference at Lincoln University
due to the weather. '

The $666.60 allocated to the Board for
travel expenses was not taken out of the
Board’s budget.

Instead, the Board conducted a three-
hour conference call with the other state-
related schools — Lincoln, Penn State and
Temple.

Landreneau said that the Board pri-
marily discussed the organization’s up—
coming rally, to take place on Jan. 31 in
Harrisburg.

Distractions: Who needs ’em?

How to avoid diuersions from your otherwise fulﬁlling life

     

g By Oliver Bateman
Senior Staff Writer

We’re going to address a very im-
portant topic: how to avoid distrac-
tions in this ADD-afflicted world of
ours. But before we do that, let’s see
what’s happening on Facebook. Oh,
that’s a cool cat. Looks
like a Persian. Or
a _tabby. Or a
Siamese.
Aside:

Danielle Hu
Staff Illustrator

Look up varieties of house cat
on Wikipedia. Regardless of breed,
this ﬂabby feline warrants a “like.”
While We’re at it, let’s click through
to this person’s page. We used to date
her, so why not, right? Maybe she’s
found true love. '

' My goodness, she has. She’s get-
ting married to a guy who makes
way more money than we do. That’s
heartbreaking. The fact that we
make so little money, that is. Not

the part that she’s getting married. I

Good for her! Anyway, we need to
think about something else. Ah, here
we go: a text. “Sup,” it reads. Should
probably answer that. Hmm, what to
' say? Given that we’ve got an entire
column ahead of us —— and on an im-
portant topic, to boot -— we mustn’t
waste any time. “Nm u.” .
Where were we? Distractions.
Isn’t it funny how many there are?
No matter what you’re doing, even
if you’re somewhere you’cl like to be,
it’s never good enough. Face-to-face

conversations with BFFs are swell,
but is it wrong to get hella bored
when those BFFs cease for one split

.'second to entertain you? We don’t

think so. Wait, hold up. A request has
arrived from Words With Friends.
“A, E, M, P, R, S, X.” What a bunch

of crap letters. Looks like we’ll have .

to plan

 
  
  
   
  
 
 
  
  
 
 
  
  
 

a move later in the day, when we
have more free time on our hands.
Besides, we really don’t like our j erky
opponent and her jerky, made-up
words. Satay? No way! Let’s check
out the weather. Abalmy 43 degrees,
huh? Rain projected for the evening?
Man, that’s depressing. In fact, now
that we think about it, we’re feeling
really miserable. There’s no choice:
We must post a‘ melancholy Face-
book status and hope thatall of those
friends we couldn’t stand to spend
any time with in real life will weigh
in with reassuring comments about

  Focus on facets of college that truly matter

A Forget rankings — communities, local culture determine best universities

By Andrew Kaback
Columnist ,

Dear Prospective University of
Pittsburgh College Student,

I spent my senior year of high
school stressing about which
university would be the right fit
for me. Poring through really
unnecessarily expensive refer-
ence books seemed like the ap-
propriate thing to do, so I did it.
I made rankings for everything.
There was a list for nightlife,
size and prestige. I knew which
schools had the most difficult
admissions processes, highest
SAT score averages and lowest

dropout rates. Unfortunately,

I really didn’t learn anything
about the colleges that I looked
at. --
Between all of the packets
I made and presentations I at-
tended, my decision—making
process became too methodical.
It was like deciding if I liked a
dish based on the nutrition facts
sheet. I thought about looking
into the culture of campuses, but
how can anyone ﬁgure that out
from an afternoon visit?
Within two months of begin-
ning my official college career,
I was washing out my eyes and
trying to catch deep breaths be-
tween coughing fits that were
disgusting my new dormmates.
G-20 left few without storie‘s,
but I always took the event as
some poetic sign from the uni-
verse that I was out in the real
world, away from the comfort
of my hometown and parents’
watchful eye. I was just a by-
stander, wondering what it must
have been like at Kent State Uni-

versity in 1970 or on the steps of I

Little Rock Central High School
in 1957. For me, the G-20 summit
marked the end of  life as a
child and it was never a consid-
eration in my school selection.

The things that matter and-

define your college’ experience
have nothing to dowith student-
teacher ratios ororientations.
I connected to a community

through an international event ,

and cameto love Pitt through

everything but what shows up

 

taken on the court will result

in the guide book. So here’s my
advice to you: judge us onwhat
actually matters.

Like the Oakland Zoo. Unless-

Duke is the only other school
under consideration, dismiss
any notion that there is a bet-
ter sports experience than the
endurance test of a Pitt basket-
ball game. Make sure that cardio
is on the workout schedule and
be willing to lose your voice,
because the thrill of the Zoo is
like BASE jumping. Every shot

of your life. I know friendships
that have been torn apart over
the decision whether to make a
late—night run to Antoon’s or to
Sorrento’s. Move overlRepubli-
cans‘ and Democrats, because-
the pizza debate is the only thing
that matters on your South Oak-
land Friday night.

Like the Cathedral of Learn-
ing. Yes, I know that it kind of
looks like Hogwarts. No, they
didn’t ﬁlmthe movie there. The
Cathedral will be of use to you

in every state of your college

life. When you’re hungry, you
go to the Cathedral. When you

:.have togo to class, you goitoithe

Cathedral. When you have abso-
lutely no clue where you are in
Pittsburgh, follow the Cathedral.

Please throw out the rankings
and forget about what the books
say. The right college isn’t about
the right test score; it’s the place
where you can growinto an adult
and have some fun along the way.

First-place Panthers exten winning streak

By Dustin Gabler
Stajf Writer

The No. 9 Pitt wrestling team ex-
tended its winning streak in the
Eastern Wrestling League to 16
matches on Friday as it easily han-
dled Clarion for a 28-10 victory.

The Panthers — currently sit-
ting in ﬁrst place in the conference
— are 4-0 against EWL opponents
this season.

Pitt jumped out to a quick lead
against the Golden Eagles, claiming
victories in its ﬁrst four matches.

At 125 pounds, No. 15 Anthony
Zanetta started the match with
a 12-1 major decision over Trey
Hicks, earning four points for
Pitt.

With his 12-0 dual record, Za-
netta —— frequently faced with the
responsibility of getting Pitt off
to a good start — has -given the

Panthers the early lead in each
match.

“Going out ﬁrst, I must force
myself to set the tone for the other
guys and to get the crowd into the
match,” Zanetta said.

Pitt didn’t look back as the‘

wrestlers in the next three weight
classes cruised to victories. A

At 133 pounds, No. 20 Shelton
Mack picked up a 6-1 decision, and
at 141 pounds, Travis Shaffer got
bonus points for the Panthers with
a 15-0 technical fall. No. 14 Tyler
Nauman won 7-3 at 149 pounds.

Clarion ﬁred back at 157 and
165 pounds with its back—to-back

Bekzod Abdurakhmonov, defeat-
ing Pitt’s Donnie Tasser and No. 32

At 197 pounds, N o. 4 Matt Wilps

Wilps — a redshirt junior and
the highest ranked wrestler on the
team —— is having his best season

Wilps said he tries to approach

Pitt still

looking 

for Big
East win

By Kelly Flanigan
Staff Writer

The intimidating aura that once

surrounded the Petersen Events 5

Center seems to be slowly slip-
ping away as, the Pitt men’s bas-
ketballteam has now lost four
consecutive home games.

The Panthers (11-9, 0-7 Big
East) — preseason picks. to ﬁn-
ish in the top ﬁve in the Big East
—' now find themselves last in
the standings as the only Winless
team in the conference.

Pitt will look to pick up that
first conference win ——< and

'— when it takes on Providence
(12-8, 1-6 Big East) tonight at the
Petersen Events ‘Center.

“Coach just keeps telling us to
believe,” redshirt sophomoreJ.j.
Moore said. “The team is telling
us to believe. We’rejust trying to
ﬁnd the flaws and trying to ﬁnd
what is going on.”

Since falling to Rutgers 62-
39 onjan. 11, the team seems to
be improving. The Panthers lost
at No. 1 Syracuse and Marquette
by single digits before losing to
Louisville at home 73-62 after
jumping out to a lead in the first
half.

Pitt has been unable to sustain
a lead in the second half of its

games mostly due to inconsis- '

tency, poor shooting and defen-
sive lapses.

“It’s tough to lose, but I think
by the way they’ve played, it
shows,” head coach Jamie Dixon
said. “It’s not like they have not
come out and responded.”

Moore said Dixon emphasized
turnovers being a problem.

“We’ve been averaging 15.5
turnovers a game in the past
couple of games,” Moore said.

“I don’t think it’s any one thing '

that is keeping us from winning.

GREGORIAN RANTS

By Greg Trietley
Senior Staff Writer

So I spent this past weekend thinking of a
proper movie analogy for Pitt sports.
First, I thought of the program as a mon-
ster movie. You walk outside. “Is it unusu-
ally windy today?” you wonder. Suddenly,
in the distance, Pitt football arises from a
crater. Someone shouts a command to ﬂee,

and you do — after all, it’s the start of the .

fourth quarter.

But then, from the opposite direction,
Pitt men’s basketball descends from the
mountainside, spewing turnovers and
missed layups.

Why won’t my car startt? -

Then, bursting up through the ground,
women’s basketball.

Ah! Ahh!!!

Accurate, right? Unfortunately, since
Pitt’s athletic program doesn’t include a
single sport featuring lasers, robots or Tom
Cruise, I settled on outbreak movies for my

comparison instead. Think “Contagion,” “28 ,

Days Later” or “War of the Worlds” from the
aliens’ perspective. Somewhere in Buffalo,
Dave Wannstedt eats an infected chicken
wing, and eventually Travon Woodall has
to spend eight weeks in quarantine.

I don’t know exactly where or when it

started, but losing — losing games, los-

ing coaches, losing players —— has spread
throughout Pitt athletics. Men’s basketball
hasn’t won in 36ldays. Everyone knows about
it. The Panthers defeated Saint Francis (Pa.)
71-47 on Dec. 20. Since then, eight losses.
It’s the longest losing streak in thejamie
Dixon era. It’s so long that media outlets
have been forced to ﬁnd more creative ways

toexpress the slide. We’re nearing “the price ‘

of gas the ‘last time...” territory for it.

The infection of mediocrity (mediocri-
tis?) certainly didn’t spawn at the Petersen
Events Center — once a shelter from previ-
ous outbreaks of rampant athletic failure
—— but the arena must have metaphorical
standing water these days. The women’s bas-
ketball team has gone nearly four weeks and
six games without a win after showing prom-
ise in competition over winter break.

And football, well: Paul Chryst is the
fourth head coach in the past 13 months.
The Panthers lost in the Compass Bowl to
Southern Methodist 28-6, which means it
will carry a one-game losing streak with it
for a full eight months. The team last won
on Dec. 3, beating Syracuse_ at Heinz Field
33-20. A

The football, men’s basketball and wo m-
en’s basketball teams have no wins in 2012,
which, come to think of it, is another movie

we are trying to do that now.”

Moore also said that giving up layups
has been an issue on the defensive end. The
team’s goal is to give up 10 or fewer layups
per game, but the Panthers have been al-
lowing nearly 16 layups a game of late.

i 1 “We need to keep getting better de-
fensively both man-to-man and within
our zone,” Dixon said. “We know we have
to make improvements, and we can do it.
We’re trying to teach the new guys to do
things consistently every time out.” is

After the loss to Louisville on Saturday,
Pitt point guard Travon Woodall —+ who
returned from abdominal and groin inju-
ries he suffered in November ——’said he
was’ “readyto play” and that the injury
was “not an excuse.” » ‘P

Woodall didn’t score, dished out two
assists and turned the ball over three times
in 21 minutes against the Cardinals.

“I’m‘ back, and I got cleared to play,”
he said. “I am all here, but I just didn’t
have it today. I tried to go out and give it

my all, but unfortunately it was nowhere

near enough.” .

Dixon said that Woodall practiced Mon-
day, but added that it’s going to take time
for him to improve. .» t -

the team’s doctor on Monday afternoon.
He’s questionable for today’s contest and
could leave the Panthers short on depth
in the frontcourt.

“He probably has a bruise,” Dixon said.
“He went down pretty hard.”

The Panthers will need a healthy and
consistent lineup if they want to stop their
losing streak tonight. Dixon called Provi-
dence an experienced team and added that
guard Vincent Council will be most valu-
able player on the floor for the Friars.

Council runs the Friar offense and av-
erages 16.2 points and seven assists per
game. His backcourt mate, sophomore
guard Bryce Cotton, averages 14.8 points
per game." — '

“Providence has got a lot of size;Aat
times they like to play small too,” Dixon
said. “They rely a lot on their perimeter
scoring. Council has really gotten better
each year.”

The Friars’ only Big East win came at

-_ home in a 90-59 upset over then-No. 15

Louisville. Providence has four players
averaging double ﬁgures in points per
game. :

Dixon said the Panthers are committed
to ﬁxing the team and picking up their ﬁrst
win tonight. Moore agreed. . H

“We’re playing as if Wednesday is going
to be our first win,” Moore said. “We’re
just going to continue to play hard. We’re
trying to pick things up and get everything

‘ together. Everybody’s inthis together. It’s
an ‘all-in’ mentality.” 3

son against Edinboro will provide Wilps with
one of his biggest tests of the season when
he faces No. 1 Chris Honeycutt.

Wilps is 24-2 overall. His two losses came
against No. 1 Honeycutt in the season— open-
ing Buffalo Open and to N o. 3 Matt Powless
of Indiana at the Cliff" Keen Invitational in
Las Vegas. '

Wilps said the Panthers aren’t yet look-

have two weeks to prepare for their last away
dual of the EWL season when they’ll travel to
Morgantown to face the Mountaineers.

during the two-week matchless stretch as
their coaches prepare them for the next se-
ries of competitions.

“The guys have done a good job of stay-
ing focused,” assistant coach Jason Peters
said. “They take each dual one at a time.
We need to continue improving wrestling
techniques, execute in matches and respect
our opponents.”

Pitt will head to West Virginia on Feb. 4
looking improve to 5-0 in the EWL and win
its 17th consecutive conference match.

“The team is psyched about the win
streak in the EWL,” Wilps said. “It shows
our improvement over the years, and we
intend to keep the streak going.”
