Period Of Pre-Registration John Marshall

Begins January 4, Lasts
Through January 16

 

Second-semester registration activi-
ties for undergraduate and graduate
students will begin immediately after
the Christmas recess, according to
plans announced by Endicott A.
Batchelder, assistant University reg-
istrar.

During the Christmas recess, the
Registrar’s oiﬁce will send out to each
student postcard notices. These no-
tices will contain information as to
the date on which he should report to
the oﬁiice of the Registrar and also
instructions for obtaining study lists.

Second semester schedule lists wil.
be ready for distribution January 4.
For two weeks following the holidays,
a faculty advisory service will be.in
operation. During this entire period
and again just before the ﬁnal exami-
nation periods, the services of faculty
advisers will be available in the var:
ous departmental -oliices.

During these first two weeks, un-
dergraduate students will call at the
Registrar's oﬁices for study lists in
accord with directions appearing on
notices which they received during the
holidays. Graduate students will re-
port to the oﬂice of the dean of the
Graduate School.

The actual registration period will
be of three days’ duration, January
14, 15 and 16. At this time, student’.-
continuing in the same courses and
sections for which they are enrolled
during the first semester will com-
plete’ their registration without fur-
ther advisory assistance.

Students desiring to change their
programs of study will be directed to
the proper -advisory oﬂicer. In in-
stances of course or section changes,
department approval will be re-
quired.

Registrations at this time will be
ﬁnal. Tuition may be paid at this
time or may be delayed until ﬁnal
registration time, which is scheduled
for February 2 and 3.

Reservations Filled
For YM-YW Affair

“Sorry, but you're too late!” \
That is what Bill Mendenhall, ex-
ecutive secretary of the YMCA, has
been saying for the last three days
to would-be goers to the YM-YWCA

sponsored retreat Sunday afternoon '

and evening at Trinity Manor. ,_

It seems that Bill wants to limit
the size of the group in order to
make the discussion faster and more
interesting, ‘so those who didn't make
reservations before Wednesday found
that there was no room for them at
this retreat.

Students who are going to make

the trip will meet at 12:45 o'clock, - '

Sunday, at the Cathedral, and drive
17 miles out the William Penn High-
way to Trinity Manor.
hall is to lead the discussion, which

will start on thegsubject. “Christian- . '

ity and Our World.” Charge for the
retreat is 75 cents, which includes
transportation and the dinner.

_—:-—By Bill Trosen
Meet Sid, Ziﬁ . . 

There’s ,a sports writer out in
Los Angeles named Sid Ziff.
That’s about all we can say for
him, his name is Sid Ziff, and
we should simply ignore » him
from here on. But just for ma-
terial and“.-for "the. St0,1'Y Wt‘-’ll.tell Y0“
a little about the gentleman.’

It seems that Sid Ziﬂ’ doesn’t like
the seIectioI.1».°f Pitt‘ for the Rose

Bowl, in fact, Sid,Ziﬁ" gets quite an- "

gry and says nasty things‘ about our
Panthers. Now.-VV{e,..W°l1,ld_.‘l,'l5 ‘mind
that a‘ single bit if Sid 'Ziﬁ' knew
what he was ‘talking 3b°l.lt.2 but ll
appears that the Ziffer doesn’t know
any more about the subject than Ras
k9ll’.§lFl. kn.9w.s a__b9u.t kn.iPti"€-

Just to quote. Sid Ziff, who inci- .~
dentally holds the title of. sports,
editor of the Herald-Express,,the_f';
Ziffer foams. this. 011$ Oil“ “The 5°91"

'flection of Pittsburgh was the worst;

blow ever struck at the traditional;

Pose Bowl instit'u'tfio'n.” And a lit-

itle bit later on: "My sympathies to 

Washington, 1 repeat; my sympa-
thies. Washington can have the,‘
:game, we don't want it.” I

About the only thing the Ziﬁer did
right there was to spell the words
Pittsburgh and Washington correctly,
(bur congratulaﬁonsﬂto you’ Sid Ziﬁ; seven years now,_an_d because of the
we repeat, our congratulations. 
the rest of his. statements‘ are Just

foam, plain foam, Bcornmonly known
as bull. But that isn t all. ’ V
goes on to‘say that the. Panthers rec‘.

ord does not ._con1P-al‘.¢ with the tw?
Southern teams, ‘that thé'.Rose'Bow§
committee knew .they. had a lemogz.
when they heard that Pitt was chosen,-
and that it's an insult to the South;

An insult to ‘the So1ith,"suh!

A Well, fromMthis..v“vef have. it all
ﬁgured Qut that Sid ,Z_il'-f does:n"t HP‘ 
The: nasty ,.

prove. of the selection.
Washing.tons. didn’t. ask -the Ziffﬂ‘ I

who.  thought should play, ‘and 
the  is gloiwngkto talse_”._hi__s.. mar’ .:
hles_;‘and_ go home, he just won’t _
play  those'inipolitef7'fe.llows. I It '

And ‘Bill, Henry . . .

But -“let's ‘forget Sid Ziﬂ’, like «he,

should be forgotten, and turn to an-
other writer in Los Angeles, Blll

Henry of the Los Angeles Times.
Now, Bill is ajbit calmer about the
whole thing than Sid Ziff. Mr."Henry
says that they might have made a

better choice and again they mighf

not. He says in part: _“-For-every hol-
ler we've received" in the oﬂice over
the choice of Pitt, we’ve received ten
requests for information about when
and where to buy tickets.”

That sounds more like it. And Mr.
Henry goes on to say that-Pitt~has
played a representative schedule sec-
ond to none and that the Panthers

are deﬁnitely a, good football team;

In one point and only one point would
Mr. Henry have preferred a Southern-
team and that is because -they “would
have brought a mob of rootin’, tootin’,
sunsaguns with band, gals, and a real
live tig‘e.r!’v" I-Well,‘ in‘.-reply 7to that,
we may yet bring the best band in the.
nation out to Pasadena andggivegyoul
a real treat. The gals? It’s doubt-
ful. And the tiger? Well, Coast fans,
you'll get all the ﬁght you want when
you see that Panther football team in
action. ,  ‘o « ‘S "

In a Letter To’ The Editor, Florian Majchrzak,
president of Council, replied to, the challenge with
the argument that one week-of school could not
test the organization, and that The News made an
unfair statement when it «said that Men’S'COUnC1l
was merely another -scheme to make every stu-

dent a “key man.”  ‘ ‘

Since then, a lot" of water has ﬂowed under the
bridge; let's look at. Council's record for the last
two months and seejust what it has accomplished:

Thus far, Men's Council has:

1. Discussed the publication of a student direc-
tory but has decided to discard it.

2. Discussed a men’s loan fund, but has neither
procured any funds normade any loans. V

3. Moved to aid in the expansion of ,men’s in-
tramural athletics, but has done absolutely noth-

ing.

4. Had its picture taken for the Owl. (Every

member present.) . p

s. Held semi-monthly meetings, with difficulty

in obtaining a7 quorum.

6. Voted keys to all of its 13 members.
‘7.‘ ‘Changed its constitution to make sure that

at least one-half‘ its sophomores
reelected for next year.‘

8. Taken over men’s customs and handled it ap-
proximately as well as SFA did last_year, though
spending a great deal more money in presenting

more elaborate plaques.
9. Received an appropriation

greater part of this has been spent for customs, al-
though SFA needed onlyl$125 last year.
10. I-Ield~~on'e’ dinner meeting to be paid for out

of the appropriation.

Not a very imposing list, is it, Mr. Majchrzak?
In fact, it takes extremely great powers of concen-
tration to find even one item on the list which in
any way justifies continuance of Council's activi-
ties; but at the same time there are many items
to justify a movement for dissolution.

Ever since SFA decided _to create another or-,
ganization to supervise the nienof the University,
students lfiaveibeen dubious as to its merits. But,
to preclude possibility of injustice to a new and
inexperienced group, time has been extended. And
now it unmistakably appears that it's about time

en's Council stops looking around feverishly for
“new Lbusiness,” and gives up the ghost.

University Lab Offers Opportunity For Specialization
In Expeiimental As Well As Theoretical Phases
Of All Types Of Cooling, Air-Conditioning

Engineers - ‘studying refrigeration
and air-conditioning have the oppor-
tunity of working in one of the best-
equipped college laboratories in the
country, according to Frank H. Stien-
ing, associate professor of mechanical
engineering. — ’

“Our equipment enables us to ex-
amine and test any type of refriger-
ation unit under all conceivable work-
ing conditions,” declares Mr.. Stiening.

Pointing out that the University's
lab',.wliich "fills the lower third of the
Automotive Highways Laboratory.
has refrigerating units of every im-
portant domestic type made. M1‘-
Stiening explained, “The student_can
learn more of the scientiﬁc principles
of refrigeration from a study of vari-
ous domestic machines than he could
froiigr large commercial jobs, which
have the --disadvantages of being more
cumbersome and more expensive,” he
said.

Book Advisor Speaks
Before Inquiry Forum
On ‘New Democrocy’

 

' C. W. Mason, Reader's’ Counselor at
the Carnegie Library, will speak at
the nquiry Forum, Monday, in Room
107, State Hall, on “New Democracy.”

Mr. Mason has been Reader’s
Counselor at the library for six years,
and is interested in adult education,
especially concerning government af-
fairs. He has written a book entitled
“Executive Ability — Its Discovery
and Development,” and frequently
contributes to various periodicals.

make the University's lab one of the
best of college labs is a set of three

testing calorimeters, used to test re-

frigeration units under varying loads
and temperatures, and a dehydrating
oven, in which7the machines are de-
hydrated before charging with refrig-
erant and oil.

Experiments in air-conditioning are

conducted in an insulated room at
one end of the lab. The room may
be heated by a hot water system and
cooled by a large refrigerating unit,
the only commercial machine in the
lab.

Equipment for charging machines
with any refrigerating gas is fre-
quently used. Among gases with
which engineers experiment are sul-
phur dioxide, ammonia, methyl, chlor-
ide, carrene and freon. . .

An interesting demonstration which
illustrates the basic principle of re-
frigeration has been devised by Mr.
Stiening. He uses a-vacuum cleaner
fan, a metal cylinder with baffle
plates inside, and some tubing. After

, some alcohol has been poured into the
cylinder and the fan kept running‘

for _a few minutes, evaporating the
alcohol, the outside of the cylinder
becomes cold and frosted, like the
cooling unit of a household refrig-
erator. j

Mr. Stiening, who is also associated
with the ‘Airtemp division of Chrysler
Corporation, believes that “Air-condi-
tioning in homes is going to become
more and more important within the
next few years. Already air-condi
tioning apparatus is beginning to ﬁnd
a place in many homes, in addition to
its present uses in commercial estab
lisliments."

Maybe it's because her dad owns
one, or because she has turned the
handle of a gasoline pump, but any-
how, one girl of the class of 1940
wants to work in a garage after grad-
nation.

But if this is unusual, one has only
to look in the ﬁles of the office of the
Dean of Women to discover that, like
Caesar, the freshman women are very
ambitious. Fields which have been
traditionally dominated by men are
aspired to by these women: “science,
radio, diplomatic service, foreign sec-
retary, and college teaching. In the

scientiﬁc ﬁeld there will be three psy.--;

chologists, one chemist, and one biolo-
gist. 9 g
It must be the motherly instinct or_
the desire to tell other people what to
do that urges almost one hundred
freshmen to en,ter.the, profession of
teaching; Maybea good-looking his-
tory instructor has something to do

looked the present crowded ‘waiting
lists for placements of teachers.

One danseuse and one violinist will
represent the class in the artistic
world. while eight doctors and ﬁve
lawyers will carry the banner of 1940
into the professional world.

The desire to be novelists or col-
umnists appeals to eighteen women;
department store officials and person-
nel directors, to ﬁfteen.

It was the fashion a few years back
for girls to train for secretarial work,
but today, social service and library
work are more popular. Even the
ﬁeld of advertisingiwill be invaded by
three women. One girl hopes to be
an interpreter of foreign languages,
and another, a laboratory technician.
. None of the freshman women was
‘frank enough to designate marriage as
their desired vocation, unless the girl
who simply marked “Nursery” had
that in mind. - ‘-
