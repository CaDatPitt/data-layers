Pitt senior George Mongel bought a

But because ofhis efforts and those of
Student Govermnent Board members Liz
KleinandDamonHudac,hecantrytosell
ittostudentsacrossthenationonthe
Internet for whatever price he wants.

That’s because Mongel, who chairs
the Academic Affairs Committee, Klein,
and Hudac have made BookSwap, a virtu-
al used-textbook store, part of the SGB
Web page.

“We got it so students don’t get
gypped by the book vendors,” said

Mongel. “The person selling it makes
money, and the person buying it saves
money [with BookSwap].”

To use Bookswap, students need to
log onto the SGB’s Web page at
www.pitt.edu/~sgb and follow the
prompts to the Bookswap link. Before
students start selling and buying books,
though, they need to ‘join” the service. All

Proposed faculty rating system could hurt dental school

James Maude
Staff Writer

Among faculty members Pitt’s School
of Dental Medicine, a proposed faculty rank-
ing system is proving to be a real toothache.

The proposal outlines several quantita-
tive requirements that faculty members
would have to fulﬁll. It assigns point values
to faculty duties such as lecturing, publishing
research papers, obtaining research grants
and serving on committees.

Several faculty members have argued
that the purely quantitative rating system
might lead to a decrease in teaching stan-
dards by favoring faculty who spend more
time and effort on research and administra-
tive duties and, in effect, burdening faculty
members who spend more of their time
teaching.

According to Robert Mundell, a profes-
sor in the dental school’s Department of
Anatomy and Histology, Bennett presented
the document for the purpose of having fac-
ultymembers at the meeting look over the
proposal, which is still being discussed

“It was distributed at our departmental
meeting by our acting department chair,”
said John Baker, an associate professor in the
dental school’s Department of Oral Biology.
“This is a very disturbing proposal, and it
upset a lot of faculty that the committee

thought it was 

According to the proposed rating sys-
tem, which would assign fractions of points
to each faculty member’s various duties, a
score of 4.5 and above
would be considered meri-
torious, a score of between
3.0 and 4.4 would be satis-
factory, and anything less
than 3.0 would be deemed
unsatisfactory.

As an example, faculty
members would get 0.5
points for each published
paper and 0.01 points per
lecture hour.

For a faculty member
to attain a 3.0 score through
teaching, 300 lecture hours
per year would be required,
which is equivalent to 10
credit hours per semester. 

"That is a very heavy p
teaching load,” said Baker. “
“Someone teaching that 
much will not be able do A .
much research or publish
many research papers.” -

‘This proposal leaves out the human
element entirely,” said University Senate
President Gordon Macl_eod “It shows no
interpersonal relationships between faculty

He Said

and students, faculty and faculty, and faculty
and administration. It is basically a corrupt-
ing inﬂuence of academic performance. It
represents a model used in a corporate set-
ting especially for low-level
employees as a system of
reward and punishment”

‘‘It doesn’t measure the
quality of teaching and
doesn’t take into account the
amount of time spent with
students,” said Baker. “lt
;. just takes the number of
teaching hours into
accormt.” .

Macbeod said that a rat-
ings system such as that in
the proposal may adversely
affect the quality of educa-
tion offered by the School of
Dental Medicine.

Both MacLeod and Baker
said that the requirements
are excessive and would be
tough to attain, especially
for lower—level faculty who
are not course directors or
do not serve on any committees or do not
obtain part of their salaries through outside
grants.

According to the proposal, abstracts are

not included in the points scheme for
research publishing. Abstracts are docu-
ments describing medical research that are
released quickly to avoid the lengthy delay
involved in publishing a full-length research
paper. Breakthrough research is often pub-
lished in abstracts.

“Oftentimes, abstracts are the germ of
the idea.” Said MacLeod.

Baker said lower—level and untenured
faculty members would find it hard to attain
the “satisfactory” rating if the proposal were
implemented

‘This proposal is a tool which can used
in a discriminatory way,” said Baker.

‘‘[The Department of Oral Biology]
does not have enough courses for every fac-
ultyrnembertofulﬁll10credithoursper
semester,” said Baker. “It means that some-
one will be squeezed out. Untenmed faculty
especially may be vulnerable because of
this.”

According to MacLeod, this is the first
time a ratings system of this nature has been
proposed for the Department of Oral
Biology, though a similar system was imple-
mented in the dental school’s anesthesiology
department, though it did not have such
stringent requirements. He said the anesthe-
siology system also tends to favor faculty
members who hold administrative or
research-oriented positions.

Students, faculty clash over
quality of teaching at Pitt

Jason Galllnger

    

Staff Writer

Beverly Harris-Schenz, Pitt’s vice
provost for faculty affairs and an associate
professor of German, said students who
have complaints about Pitt have a responsi-
bility to voice their concerns.

“You wouldn’t go to Kaufmann’s and
buy a coat with only one sleeve without
complaining,” Harris—Schenz said “I think
students should act the same way when it
comes to their education.”

But sophomore Jennifer Karch, a
Student Government Board member, said
she thinks there shouldn’t be anything at Pitt
to complain about in the ﬁrst place.

“You wouldn’t go into Kaufmann’s and
ﬁnd a coat with only one sleeve,” Karch
quipped. “You expect Armani, you pay for
Armani, you get Amiani. I came to Pitt
because it’s a quality institution and I expect
to get a quality education.”

The University Senate’s Wednesday
plenary session provided a forum for exact-
ly this type of debate. Approximately 60 stu-
dents and faculty members gathered in the
William Pitt Union Ballroom to hear stu-
dent and faculty representatives discuss
problems in their relationship. Chancellor
Nordenberg also attended.

SGB President Alyson Wallach spoke
on behalf of the undergraduate student
body.

“Students want to know why profes-
sors who receive bad remarks on their end-
of-the-semester student evaluations don’t
change their teaching style,” she said “Who
holds them accountable?”

Wallach described this problem as an
issue about which students are going to start
demanding answers. She also indicated that
teaching assistants who are not ﬂuent in
English are a major problem.

“Oral ﬂuency [in English] must be
demanded,” she said “Sometimes [TAs]
can’t understand questions from students,

and sometimes they aren’t able to answer
them.”

Wallach said these types of problems
can no longer be tolerated, and that students
should not be expected to pay high tuition
while being taught by inferior staﬂ mem-
bers

However, Jonathan Harris, an associate F

professor of political science, defended the
TA—selection process.

He said all TA candidates are required
to take an oral proﬁciency exam given by
the English Language Institute in conjunc-
tion with the department sponsoring the TA
position. He acknowledged that the system
is not ﬂawless but insisted that it represents
a serious effort by the University to improve
the selection process.

Harris also discussed students’ ﬁnancial
concerns, which he said he feels are a major
hurdle for students to clear.

“Tuition costs keep going up,” he‘ said.
“What we are winding up with is a student
body that is full—time on paper but part-time
in fact.”

Harris said students experience tremen-
dous strain by attempting to balance classes
and a part-time job to pay for school. He
pointed to a 1996 senior survey which
showed that 80 percent of the students
polled had a part—ti1ne job.

Because students are working so many
hours, they have difficulty keeping up with
course work, he said. Also, students often
have little time to attend professors’ office
hours, which results in complaints from fac-
ulty members that those hours are a waste of
time.

In the end, very few solutions to these
and other problems were suggested

University Senate President Gordon
MacLeod, however, seemed optimistic. The
Senate, he said, heard many issues it could
consider when trying to improve faculty-
student relationships.

“I think the students have been our
teachers this aftemoon,” he said.

Vendor explains his ’tack|e’

James Maude

Staff Writer

On Tuesday afternoon, Pitt Police
arrested an unidentiﬁed man outside the
Cathedral of Learning for attempting to steal
$350 worth of merchandise from the Pitt
Stop — the clothes vendor located on the
corner of Bigelow Boulevard and Forbes
Avenue. .

Charles Bonasorte, owner of the Pitt
Stop, was alerted to the alleged thief by a
customer who saw a stranger inside the Pitt
Stop’s van, which was parked across
Bigelow Boulevard. Bonasorte began to
cross Bigelow slowly to sneak up on the
man. Before he got there, though, the culprit
backed out of the van onto the pavement and
turned to run down the walkway. Bonasorte
gave chase. The suspect jumped over a
hedge onto the Cathedral lawn, but
Bonasorte managed to grab and restrain him.

“['Ihe suspect] said, ‘You’re holding me
too tight. W111 you let go a little, please?”’
said Bonasorte. “I stepped back a bit, and he
reached for his pocket, and I told him not to
‘cause he could’ve had a gun or a knife, and
he said he wanted a cigarette. He ran again,
andlgrabbedhimagainandpulledhimto

the ground, and he was lying in the mud”

The suspect put up a ﬁght and tried fran-
tically to escape, scratching Bonasorte’s face
and biting his knuckles, Bonasorte
explained

_ “I never swung at him or anything,”
said Bonasorte. “It was like riding a bull. He
ran out of energy before I did.”

Bonasorte, a former Pitt Panther line-
backer, managed to keep the suspect down

ited the oiﬁcers for their quick arrival after

“When [the suspect] heard the sirens, he

When medics arrived, the police hand-
cuffed the suspect to a gumey. The arresting
officer Pitt Police Officer Shannon Santucci.

The Pitt Police officer who was contact-
ed about the case referred all questions to
Deputy Police Chief Gary Moses, who
could not be reached for comment. The oﬂi-
cer did say, however, that the suspect had
been transported to Allegheny County Jail.

Career Day fair showcases the

Carrie Hager

What do a lawyer, a bank vice president
and a special—projects coordinator for
fundraising have in common? They all have
English degrees from Pitt.

So much for the popular belief that
English majors only become teachers.

These three Pitt alumni spoke yesterday
afternoon at a career-development fair spon-
sored by the English department. The Career

Day fair was the departrnent’s second annu-

al event of its kind.

Pitt English Professor Paul Kameen
said he believed the event was very beneﬁ-
cial to students. “It’s important for students
to think about options as early as possible,”
he explained, adding that the students who
attended learned of a few new career oppor-
tunities that a background in English might
allow them to pursue.

Kameen noted that Pitt has several other
fairs each year to help students ﬁnd jobs in
the writing and teaching ﬁelds, and said the
purpose of this fair, however, was to demon-
strate that English majors can ﬁnd jobs that
are not directly related to their studies.

The alumni speakers all agreed that
their backgrounds in English have helped
them immensely in their various careers.

Robert Byer, a partner at the Kirkpatrick
and Lockhart law ﬁrm who graduated from
Pitt in 1973, explained that his English major
prepared him well because lawyers have to
do a lot of writing.

“English majors have a decided advan-
tage because lawyers need to have good

r English majors

writing skills,” Byer told the group. He con-
tended that writing skills are essential to
many good careers. “If you draw on your
writing skills, the sky is the limit,” he said.

Claire Hildenbrand, who graduated
from Pitt in 1972 and is now vice president
of National City Bank, Pittsburgh, also said
her English background was important to
her career because her job involves a lot of
writing and assembling of proposals.

Hildenbrand said, “Proposals must be
concise and professional—looking to get busi-
ness.” She explained that in her line of work,
the way in which something is written can
make or break a deal.

Hildenbrand found an interested audi-
ence: Chris Holwick, a senior, said he came
to the fair speciﬁcally to speak with her.
Holwick said he never even imagined that
he could go into banking with his degree. “I
always thought that you could just write or
teach, but there is a lot more,” he said

Mary Ellen Kubit, who graduated in
1997 and a special—projects coordinator for
Health Sciences Development at Pitt, said

« she believed what helped her most in getting

her current job was her background in
English and the skills this helped her to
develop. “Reading and writing is connected
to analytical thinking,” she said. ' .

The panelists also dished out some suc-
cess secrets and career advice.

Robert Byer said, ‘Find something you
love doing, and work hard to be the best you
can be. Success will follow.” He added that
students shouldn’t equate success with
money, that it is more important that they are
happy with what they do.

local rock ‘n’
roll legend

During the week, Art Nardini
seems to live an average life.
He travels to Oakland from his

home in Bloomfield to attend child-

hood development classes all day at
Pitt, wearing his signature black
motorcycle jacket and dark sunglass-
es.

At the end of the day, he returns
home to his wife, Jean, and his son
Andy.

On the weekends, however, he
puts on a different face, playing bass
into the early morning hours at bars
and clubs in the band Joe Grushecky
and the Houserockers.

In addition to playing bass,
Nardini, 49, holds positions as a
full—time student, husband and
father. ,

“It’s not an easy thing to do,”
said Nardini. “On the weekends, I’m
a night person, up until
3:00 or 4:00 in the
morning, and in the
week, I’m a day per—
son.”

The Houserockers,
whose sound mixes
classic rock, R&B and
blues, formed as the
Iron City Houserockers
in 1975 when Nardini
was in college the first
time at the California
University of
Pennsylvania. Nardini
ran into high—school
friend Joe Grushecky
on campus, and the two
decided to bring back

practiced in the Nardini
family’s living room.
The Houserockers
looked for an agent on

managers that pro-
duced good rock, and

They left with a contract. This

of the
Houserockers.

The young
musicians toured

the United States
several times.
Although they ~ .
never had a chance to play in the
Deep South, they played the East
Coast “a whole lot,” noted Nardini.

Eventually, the Iron City
Houserockers soared, becoming
known worldwide as “the next big
thing.”

Though expectations for the
Houserockers were high and though
they. pushed themselves to keep
pumping out popular albums, the
band failed to write a hit single.

“We never quite made it,” said-

Nardini.

The band went into a downward
spiral and eventually lost their
recording contract.

  
  
  
 
 

 

They broke up shortly after
because some of the membersquit,
Nardini said, when they “got tired of
the music business and probably did-
n’t like being poor.”

The remaining members kept
going and formed Joe Grushecky
and the Houserockers, the band they
are today.

Along their way, the
Houserockers inched their way into
the music industry, meeting and per—
forming alongside big names
in rock such as Lou Reed,
Meat Loaf and Ian Hunter.
But while these groups per—
formed with the
Houserockers, one big star
was close enough to the
group to call them friends.
This man was Bruce
Springsteen.

The Boss has toured with the
Houserockers many times
and, Nardini said, is good
friends with Grushecky, but
Nardini’s relationship with
Springsteen is as a business
partner.

’“We work together, but I
wouldn’t call him a friend,”
said Nardini.

The Houserockers and
Springsteen united again this
month at Nick’s Fat City on
the South Side.

“When he plays with us, he
becomes the seventh member
of the Houserockers,” said
_ Nardini.

O The band toured Europe in
' ° 1996.and was greeted in most
of its countries by very
. > enthusiastic fans.

“People said they had been
waiting 18 years to see us,”
' 2 said Nardini.

Though the band is well-

known and popular, the
members did not leave their
Pittsburgh homes for the West Coast,
as many‘ “arrived” groups do.

He said they realized Pittsburgh
“is not the hotbed of the music

industry” but that it is home to them,

and they never considered leaving it ‘

for the big time and didn’t know if
they could have made it big if they
had decided to move away from
Pittsburgh. ‘

“It was the way we wanted to do 9

it,” said Nardini. “We’re just regular
people who like the Steelers and the
Pirates.”

Right now, Nardini is in his sec-
ond semester of his junior year here
at Pitt, hoping to finish with a degree
in childhood development.

“I like working with kids,”
explained Nardini.

When Nardini isn’t strumming
his bass with the Houserockers or
sifting through his education books,
he plays “for fun” with another
Pittsburgh band, Andrea Pearl and
the River Rats.

And in between his rock ‘n’ roll
work, Nardini has gained experience

working with children as a child.

counselor and a Little League coach,
in addition to raising his 11-year-old
son.

When he receives his degree, he
would like to work with families of
disabled children.

Before that happens, however,
Nardini intends to continue as a rock
star —— the band plans to begin a
United States tour the day after
Nardini’s last final exam.

BookSwap,” said Klein, “is that students
can set their own prices.”

Students wishing to buy a book can
search for it by entering a subject, course
number, book title or the book’s author.
Also, a person looking for a book can
limit his search to a particular university,
to a state, or to the entire country.
Considering that close to 100 universities
in Pennsylvania alone participate in
BookSwap, students from literally thou-
sands of colleges post their books on this
Web site.

Klein first heard about BookSwap in
early February when BookS wap President
John Wright called her about his compa-
ny’s Web page. He told her to check it out
from Michigan State University’s site and
let him know what she thought.

After seeing “how very easy” this
free service was and talking with the rest
of her board, she V and Mongel worked
with Wright through e—mails to customize
the system to Pitt’s needs, according to
Klein. Hudac helped customize the final
product and link it to the SGB’s page, she
added. a ’

The ﬁnal product is now ready for
students to use, but don’t expect to ﬁnd
right away 15 people at Pitt selling the
book you are looking for. That’s because
the SGB is going to start mass—advertising
the BookSwap in about 10 days.

Melissa Meinzer, a freshman,
checked the site out yesterday and said

once people start using it, it will be

“extremely useful.”

“Selling books back now is ridicu-
lous,” she said. “I bought one for around
$50 and got $8 for it.”

Mongel is optimistic that posting
ﬂiers and posters on campus about the
new service, advertising it on Pitt TV, and
holding a help day about it at the Hillman
Library should get students interested in
BookSwap by the end of the month.

By that time, students will start sell-
ing their books back, said Klein, which is
one reason SGB wants to begin promot-
ing it now. _

“Word of mouth alone will get stu-
dents interested after a few of them start
using it,” said Mongel. “It’s going to be a
win—win situation for everyone.”

Reaganites: Keep things in perspective

Michael Berquist

 
  

Plan B for Pill‘: A
new baseball field?

The Pitt baseball team tried to start its’

home season yesterday.

For much of the afternoon, the air was
damp, recovering from a few sprinkles over
the past few days and the early morning
hours. Still, any baseball field short of a
sandlot could have been raked, sprinkled
with dirt and raked again in time for some
baseball, albeit a bit muddy game.

Any field, that is, but Pitt’s field.

Trees Field, located behind the Cost

Center and the OC parking lot, could be the
worst field the area has to offer next to the
worn-down Mazeroski Field outside Forbes
Quad.

Of course, Mazeroski Field is where the
Pitt women's softball team might play its
home games next season. But that’s anoth-
er story.

For now, it’s important to realize that
the poor facilities offered to the baseball
team cost it a matchup against intracity
rival Duquesne —-— a game that probably
won’t be made up this season. It’s also hin-
dered the team’s ability to prepare for the
brunt of its Big East Conference schedule,
which begins this weekend.

Thanks to Gov. Ridge’s funding and
Chancellor Nordenberg’s planning, the
majority of Pitt’s indoor sports have a
secure_future when it comes to facilities.
The basketball teams have a new arena, and
the gymnasts, wrestlers and volleyball
players have the field house all to them-
selves. .

Yet the outdoor sports have been large-
ly ignored in this regard. Ask a Pitt student
about baseball facilities, and he’ll produce
a drawing of the proposed Pirates Park.

It’s time Pitt got itself a Plan B as well.
To complement a new convocation center,
improvements to the baseball field are def-
initely in order. p

Carve out a dirt infield. Replace the
worn-down bleachers. If all else fails, cover
the whole mess with artificial turf — while

Columnist

I've always found the admirers
of former President Ronald Reagan
to be a strange bunch. The Pitt
College Republicans typically have a
pizza party every year to celebrate
Reagan's birthday. Recently, the
Republicans in Congress pushed
through a bill to rename
Washington's National Airport after
Reagan and elected to spend $738
million of the taxpayers‘ money to
construct the second-largest federal
building in the United ‘States, an odd
tribute to the supposed apostle of
smaller government. Some are even
in the midst of an effort to put
Reagan's face on Mt. Rushmore.
(Sad, but true.)

The problem I have with Reagan
disciples is that their starry-eyed
admiration of their hero leads them to
gloss over some of the more serious
failures of his administration. The
Reagan administration saw the
explosion of the budget deﬁcit, the
growth of income inequality between
the rich and the poor, and a host of

- other problems.

I also find their unquestioning
admiration of Reagan rather disturb-
ing in itself, as it borders on worship.
After all, I admire President Harry
Truman, but whenever his birthday
rolls around each May 8, I don't run
out to celebrate it. Admiring a presi-
dent without carefully gauging what
his successes and failures were is
downright dangerous, and Reagan's
accomplishments have been blown
way out of proportion by Reaganites
desperate to make the facts ﬁt their
thesis that their hero was a great
leader.

The first and most crippling
problem of the Reaganites is the
massive crippling debt he saddled

America with during his spending
spree of the 1980s. Reagan's most
fervent defenders typically blame
Congress (which has become their
alibi for nearly all of Reagan's fail-
ures), but that argument fails to hold
water when one considers that during
the eight years that Reagan was pres-
ident, he asked Congress to spend
$16.1 billion dollars more than those
evil taxers and spenders ended up
appropriating. Rush Limbaugh was
more right than he knew when he
said Reagan was "a man to whom we
Americans owe a debt we will never
be able to repay."

’ The second problem is the gap
between the haves and the have-nots
that increased during the Reagan era.
Rush Limbaugh has claimed, "All
income groups paid less in taxes as a
percentage of their income during the
Reagan years, but the poor received
the most relief, the middle class the
next, and the rich, the least." Alas for
Rush, this is yet another untrue state-
ment. Figures from the
Congressional Budget Ofﬁce show
that the poorest ﬁfth of Americans
saw their taxes increase by 15 per-
cent during the Reagan era, while the
richest ﬁfth saw their taxes decrease
by 15 percent. The CBO also discov-
ered that same poorest ﬁfth of
Americans saw their income drop by
10 percent during the Reagan era,
while the richest one percent of our
nation, the very elite of American
society, saw their income increase by
more than 100 percent. It's obvious
that an elite few beneﬁted from
Reagan's tax cuts.

So why do Republicans admire
Reagan so much? I have a theory:
They desperately want the Reagan
era to be a nostalgic era, a kind of
conservative counterpoint to the lib-
eral New Deal era, a time that most
people remember as a simple, idyllic

THE PITT NEWS

time. Republicans need the rest of
America to fondly remember the
1980s and Reagan the same way that
many fondly remember the 1930s
and FDR -— because it validates their
rhetoric that America today is a con-
servative country and that the
Republicans are the philosophical
majority. Unless Americans look
back at the 1980s and think, "Hey,
those were the days, weren't they?" it
makes their adoration of Reagan look
a little foolish.

But all of this hasn't stopped
Reagan admirers from naming trib-
utes to their hero. Federal buildings,
aircraft carriers, highways, schools.
One wonders how many billions the
taxpayers would save if Congress
hadn't decided to give all of these
honors to their hero. Why don't we
hold off on all of these starry-eyed
tributes to Reagan until we can gain a
better perspective on his legacy?
After all, the Lincoln Memorial was
not built until 44 years after President
Lincoln's assassination. Construction
of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's
memorial didn't end until 52 years
after his death.

To honor Reagan with all of
these accolades while his legacy is
still so uncertain is insulting to the
memory of the great men who went
before him. We are certain of the

power of the legacies of Lincoln, 1

Truman and Roosevelt. It dishonors
their memories to hand out accolades
to a man whose record has yet to
stand the test of time. My advice to
the Reaganites is to go home, get
some rest and let history take its
course. If Reagan was such a great
president, then in time he will be rec-
ognized as such.

Michael Berquist thinks that Ronald
Reagan was not even half the man
that Harry Truman was.

Columnist

Those of you -familiar
with Vladimir Nabokov's
"Lolita" know that the mid-
dle-aged Humbert Humbert
fell in love and was infatuat-
ed with a little vixen named
Lolita. Problem was, Lolita
happened to be 14 years old.

A similar thing happened
to me over spring break.
Cynical students would say
that's what happens
when one remains in
Pittsburgh over the break.
Now, I will not .mention
names, because the young
female subject's parents are
Pitt alumni, but I will say
that she did not look like a
14-year-old, and I could have
gotten into a lot of trouble
that would not have been my
fault if she had lied to me.

For the sake of this col-
umn, I will call the female
subject Lolita, as it's an
appropriate name for dealing
with this topic. Lolita lives in
close proximity to me, and I
see her on a regular basis, by
coincidence, when I happen
to be going to the cinema or
around the neighborhood or
goofing around at the local
shopping mall (my French
cat Sterling was once ejected
from the food court for hang-
ing up signs ‘that said "I find
more wholesome products in
my litter tray" outside vari-
ous fast-food joints).

As a rather shy person, it
took some time before I actu-
ally developed the initiative
to talk to her. The situation
presented itself in Borders
Books, and for the record, at
this moment, I did not know
she’ was 14.

She seemed intelligent
enough, and I appeared not to
screw anything up or stam-
mer in my speech (no
"umms" to be heard), and she
knew that I lived in the same
neighborhood, and every-
thing seemed cool when I
suggested we check out the
Carnegie Museum of Art. (I
admit it —— I'm dull!)

Everything seemed fine,
and either she appeared to
know a hell of a lot about art,
as opposed to me, who came
out with occasional com-
ments like "Why did that
dude paint a can of
Campbell's soup?" and "How
come Mondrian didn't paint
diagonal lines?" Then came
the cold-water—in-the—face
sequence of phrases that
often happen in this find-out-
a-little-bit-about-this-person
phase.

"So you're a freshman?"
she asked (I will keep the
drama down to a minimum,
as I do not wish to sound like
the love child of Danielle
Steel or Judith Krantz).

"Yes. I imagine you're a
freshman as well," I said,
donning It my best English
"aristo—accent," which my

With this law in place, I

"Ummm, no. I'm clever,
but not clever enough to con-

I've had problems mis-
reading girls/women before,
but to be off the mark by five
years is not too good. I like
my young brother, but I don't
want to date his contempo-
raries. There's a little crimi-
nal offense that America
seems not to like called
"statutory rape," which is
basically there to protect
under-18s from lunatics like

and if she
said she was 18, I would
have believed her. Suppose I
had sex with her, and Sheriff
Joe Bob or the FBI (Fascist
Bureau of Interrogators) or
whoever found out and
charged me with the said
offense. What does one do?
Would I be guilty of
statutory rape? According to
the legal system, yes, but in
reality, that would not be the
case. Of course 14-year-olds,
who are in an important stage
of their development, should

LETTERS

As I was waiting for my ham sub at
the Schenley Cafe deli the other day,
one of the employees noticed that the
section of the collage of meats and veg-
etables that was supposed to contain
corned beef was actually ﬁlled with
blood—red, uncooked bacon. And she
thought her colleague's negligence was
the funniest thing she had seen all day.

"That just made my day!" she
howled as she threw away the slab of

flesh.

Well, that just made my day sick.
It's outrageous and completely inappro-
priate for the employees at the deli to
laugh and joke about what could be

 

considered involuntary

manslaughter: Any
unfortunate person
who ordered the
"corned beef" may

have died from E. coli

the guilty party will
most likely not be pun-

  A situation bordering on the statutory side of things

terms with guys my age.

Advocates and lawyers
thought the issues of abor-
tion or date rape were gray
areas, but this not-so-publi-
cized issue of statutory rape
blows them both out of the
water in terms of ambiguity.
What's consensual and what's
nonconsensual sex when
under-16s are concerned?
What does one do when
deception of age is involved?
These issues need to be
addressed.

Of course it would be
wrong for a person over 21 to
force his way on an under—16
(in this case, the charge
should be bumped up to rape
or molestation), but if it
seems consensual, and the
under-16 seems mature
enough (obviously, there are
limits as to age) and the
under-16 says that he/she is
over 16, trouble arises.

The current legal system
is not capable of differentiat-

ing between these cases in an »

effective manner, and as a
result, innocent people are
jailed while a lot of guilty

rapists escape and carry on

their dirty deeds as before.
But in retrospect, is there
anything wrong with this
relationship, if both parties
consent to it? '

James Maude’s view of this
subject was warped by
Nabokov's sensuous writing
of "L0lita.”

Researchers at the University
of Minnesota Medical School have
devised a new way to directly
manipulate DNA, according to an
article in Time magazine.

They've tested this method out
on rats‘ livers already, and it works.

The next step, according to the
article, will be showing that the
method will work with other tissues
—— and other species.

If this method is successful in
humans, we will be one step closer
to genetically engineering human
beings. The remaining step will be
mapping the entire human genome
-—— A a project that is already well
under way and that may be ﬁnished
within 10 years, depending on
funding.

Perhaps now would be a good
time to start really thinking about
what kinds of genetic engineering
will be morally acceptable to us. ‘

Many people seem to agree that
genetic engineering would only be
acceptable to correct abnormalities,
not to "improve" a healthy person
just because we can.

But this is too simple an answer
because, logically speaking, it

leaves a lot of gaps.
For example, would we consid-
er mental retardation and below-

ties? If so, then that simple rule
would allow us to "fix" the disabil-
ity by making that person smarter

and we could genetically

This cycle would

Maybe more so.

Vice President Al Gore
announced Friday that he has
instructed NASA to put in orbit a
satellite that will broadcast live
video of Earth, 24 hours a day, on

Huh?

This sounds like more proof
that science is only important to
people if it entertains them, though
I'm still not sure who wants to
watch Earth on television 24 hours
a day (save for the habitual mari-
juana users).

We'd do a lot better to spend
that money on a satellite that looks
for killer asteroids so we might not
be caught completely off guard if
doomsday comes from above.

On the other hand, we should
be able to watch the ﬁres, tidal

Nuggets on a
roll  with a
little help

I got a good one for yinz.

OK, what do the Denver Nuggets
and Monica Lewinsky have in com-
mon?

They both  .

No, that’s too painfully obvious
and a little on the crude side for a rela-
tively conservative college newspaper.

However, the NBA poster team for
futility and the president’s Flavor of the
Month do actually have something in
common, and it has nothing to do with
a four-letter word that rhymes with the
ignorant, rebellious, peanut-butter-
stealing former housemate on “The
Real World.”

Tuesday night, the Washington
Wizards had what most teams in the
NBA call an easy night.

They were scheduled to play host
to the woeful Denver Nuggets, but a
funny thing happened on the way to the
MCI Center.

No, not the fact that Lewinsky had
a seat right behind the Wizards bench, a
seat that’s very hard to come by consid-
ering that the arena’s occupants are
knocking on the playoff door this late
in the season. This isn’t the proper
forum to discuss fringe beneﬁts any-
where around the nation’s capital, any-
way, now is it?

Through the first 63 games of the
season, the Nuggets set the pace as the
laughingstock of the entire league by
losing 58 games.

Imagine‘ that you prepare for work
63 times, only to fail 58 of those times,
and you are still making millions of
dollars in the process.

Not bad, huh?

Well, the Nuggets have gotten fed
up with the constant ridicule and out-
right laughter when they come to town.

Although they are mathematically
eliminated from the playoffs and they
should be given every ball in the NBA
draft lottery, these Denverians aren’t
quitting just yet.

Having Lewinsky in the crowd
seemed to get the Nuggets up for the
game against the Wizards, and Anthony
Goldwire’s three-pointer with 7.2 sec-
onds remaining capped a 10-2 Denver
run and helped the Nuggets inch closer
to the 10-win mark — the same total
they need to reach to avoid becoming
the losingest team in NBA history, a
dubious honor held by the 9-73

Panther wrestlers invade Cleveland

Bodo, Withrow, four others compete for NCAA championships

Brian Knavlsh
Staff Writer

Mark Bodo has been to the NCAA
tournament twice before, winning All-
American honors both times.

But as he prepares for this week-
end’s tournament, which will be the ﬁnal
event in his competitive wrestling career,
Bodo has one more goal.

“I want to be national champ,” he
proclaimed.

The NCAA tournament is the last
and most important event of the
wrestling season. Only the nation’s elite
grapplers ever make it to the tournament,
and only the elite of the elite have much
success once they hit the mat.

This year Bodo is one of six Panther
wrestlers to qualify —— over half the
team’s starting lineup. He is joined by
fellow two-time All-American John
Withrow, 1998 Eastern Wrestling
League Champions Rob Loper and Nick

Mengerink, as well as Chad Jesko and
Mike Ziska.

The one thing every wrestler in the
big tournament has in common is the
dream of being crowned national chain-
pion. But realistically, each knows how
lofty a goal that is.

“Winning NCAAs  wow. That’d
be tough,” Loper explained. “Right now
I’m setting my sights on ﬁnishing in the
top eight [high enough to earn All-
American honors]. If I were to get to that
point, then I’d start thinking about ﬁn-
ishing higher.”

This year’s six Panther qualiﬁers fall
one short of the school record of seven
set by last year’s squad. But using quali-
ty, not quantity, as the gauge, this year’s
contingent may fare better as a group.

Four of the six Panthers (Loper,
Mengerink, Withrow and Bodo) are
ranked among the top six in the nation at
their respective weight classes.

“Last year we had two All-

Americans,” Bodo said. “This year we
could have four or ﬁve, so that’ll be an
improvement.”

If all six Pitt wrestlers grabbed All-
American honors, they would set a

Vic DeFelice claimed the high honor in
the 1957 NCAA tournament.

Santoro, who accomplished that feat in
1988 and 1989 in the 142-pound class.

Loper represents Pitt at the 126—pound
weight class, Jesko at 134, Ziska at 142,

With the armouncement of plans for a
new ballpark —— ready for Opening Day
2001 — unveiled on Tuesday, the Pirates
now have a future in Pittsburgh.

And with mountains of young talent
throughout their major- and minor-league
systems, the Pirates have a sunny future
on the ﬁeld as well, despite still being in

the poorhouse.

In a repeat performance of last year’s
budget slashing, the Bucs and General
Manager Cam Bonifay said farewell to
Kevin Elster and Shawn Dunston via free
agency.

Elster solidiﬁed an inexperienced
inﬁeld last year at shortstop with nearly
errorless play and some desperately need-
ed power at the plate —— seven home runs

in less than 40 games — before a broken
wrist sidelined him for over half the sea-
son.

Kevin Polcovich, a 27-year-old rook-
ie, ﬁlled in for Elster surprisingly well,
hitting .273 in 84 games, and the Pirates
didn’t miss a beat in the playoff race.
Polcovich seems to have the starting spot
tied down, but a recent streak of hitting

Disappointing seasons and a delay in a
promised new arena may have sent most
coaches packing, but men’s basketball
Head Coach Ralph Willard has weathered
the storm of four frustrating seasons and is
optimistic that there will be surmy skies
ahead.

With a plethora of untimely injuries
during his tenure at Pitt, Willard has had to
make do with a dilapidated roster from the
minute he arrived at Pitt four years ago.

“It’s been unbelievably frustrating
since I came to Pitt,” Willard said. “All you
can do is think what could have been if we
hadn’t had all those inopportune injuries
every season.”

According to Willard, injuries are a fact
that a coach and a team have to deal with
during a season.‘ It’s something that can’t be
controlled.

“We’ve had some tough breaks during
this cycle,” Willard said. “I’m sure we’ll
have a cycle in the near future where we’ll
get the breaks that go our way.”

Willard believes that if certain key
players did not get injured in 1996, Pitt
would have been a “strong NCAA touma—
ment team.” Shortly after the team traveled
to Hawaii over winter break that year, a trip
which included a win over then ﬁfth—ranked
Michigan and a near victory over national-
ly ranked Maryland, Pitt experienced every
coach’s nightmare — injuries to key play-
ers.

“There isn’t a doubt in my mind that if
Chad [Varga] wasn’t hurt and if Mark
[Blount] didn’t get bitten, we wouldn’t have
slumped in January,” Willard said. ‘These
things happen though.” Blount was bitten
by a teammate in practice, and the wound
became infected, keeping him out of action.

That January slump cost the Panthers
an NCAA tournament invitation, according
to Willard. Even though the teams perfor-
manceintheNITwasasmall steptoward
postseason prowess, it wasn’t quite an
NCAA berth.

A coach with NCAA Tournament
experience was exactly what Pitt was look-
ing for when it hired Willard. Willard had
led his former team, Western Kentucky, to
back—to-back dances, including a Sweet 16
appearance in 1993.

Willard was lured away by Pitt for two
main reasons — construction of a new con-
vocation center would begin within two
years, and the Big East was a conference
that would make his rwruiting easier.

“Western Kentucky was in the Sun
Belt Conference, which was tough to recruit
in,” Willard said. “We had trouble schedul-
ing nationally ranked teams even though
WKUwasranked, whichintummakesit
difficult to sign top players.”

THE PITT NEWS

At Pitt, Willard has been able to recruit
players frorri several areas, including the
Northeast, Mid—Atlantic, Mid—South and
the Midwest because the Big East is a high-
ly regarded basketball conference. The Big
East has expanded to 13 tearris, spreading
the conference throughout the Northeast
and Midwest.

The fact that the promised on-campus
arena took until this past January to be
approved has disappointed Willard He had
hoped to use the convocation center as a
recruiting tool within two years of his
arrival.

Then-Chancellor J. Dennis O’Connor
had told Willard at the time of the coach’s
hiring that he intended to break ground on
the arena in 1996. O’Connor left the
University in 1995, though, and the promise
to begin construction was not fulﬁlled.

“O’Connor’s intentions were there,”
Willard said. “It’s unfortunate that he had to
leave. He [O’Connor] knew how important
athletics can be for a university and its rep-
utation. He had previous experience with
good athletic programs at North Carolina
and at U CL .”

The current administration of
Chancellor Mark Nordenberg and Athletics
Director Steve Pederson has been very sup-
portive of Willard and his program. Even
with three losing seasons out of four,
Willard does not feel he is on the hot seat or
pressured to win in the upcoming seasons.

“Any pressure I feel right now is self-
imposed,” Willard said “There is absolute-
ly no pressure whatsoever coming from the
administration. They know that my top pri-
ority is to win.”

At the end of last season, Willard’s
name came up in the media concerning sev-
eral coaching and managerial openings
around the country.

Willard talked with his ﬁiend, Boston
Celtics Head Coach Rick Pitino, whom
VVillard was an assistant coach for at
Kentucky and the New York Kriicks. After
Pitino left Kentucky for Boston, he asked
Willard to be the Celtics’ general manager.
Willard was also considered for the vacant
head coaching position at Kentucky. He
declined both job olfers and remained at Pitt
in anticipation of the new arena.

“Any time you’re approached by your
best friend [Pitino] concerning a job, you
have to think about it,” Willard said. “I
stayed because I started something here at
Pitt that I didn’t ﬁnish. I wouldn’t want to let
any of the kids down. I have a commitment
to them and this university.”

According to Willard, the players are
the main reason he’s in coaching. He enjoys
seeing them mature and succeed at whatev-
er they choose to do. However, it’s also
frustrating for Willard to see a player not
accomplish his goals because of problems
with sports agents and illegal gifts. '

Coach Willard
talks 
 buildings

Willard constantly has to be aware of
the temptations that student athletes are
exposed to in the form of illegal gifts, gam-
bling and sports agents which could jeopar-
dize their college eligibility.

Many college coaches, including
Willard, show ﬁlms about the implications
of gambling for a student athlete. They even
have NBA representatives lec-
ture on what gambling and
sports agents can do to a
basketball program’s
and a student’s repu-
tation.

“A monthly
allowance for disad-
vantaged student athletes would deter
a kid from taking gifts from sports agents. I
used to get $20 for laundry when I was a
student athlete,” Willard said. “A student
athlete should at least be given one airline
trip home per year to see their family. It
would be nice for the kids to go home once
in a while without having to pay for it.”

When it comes to the newly approved
convocation center, Willard hopes it will be
more than just a recruiting tool. According
to Willard, the construction of the arena will
also accompany renovations of Tree’s Hall
and Fitzgerald Field House.

These renovations will allow students
to use quality facilities for recreation, said
Willard. It will also allow the athletics
teams to practice without the distractions
that teams have endured in the ﬁeld house,
which is used simultaneously by other stu-
dents for activities such as rimning on the
indoor track.

“We’ve had to stop practice early in the
ﬁeld house because it has been too noisy,”
Willard said. “The new arena should allevi-
ate those problems, help us retain players in
the future, and relieve the pressure that the
ﬁeld house experiences because of so much
overuse.”

Greer part II: Freshman   jitters subside as Ricky rallies Pitt hoops

Ned Schano
Senlor Staff Wrlter

The game had been a hard-fought con-

test, and Pitt looked poised to ﬁnally take
the lead With Pitt trailing Villanova by four
points, Ricardo Greer grabbed a rebound
and hit a dramatic basket with a I/Vldcat
defender draped over him. He pumped his
ﬁsts and pointed to his 50—person cheering
section, receiving a raucous roar from the
crowd. The Panthers were trying to end the
season on a high note in what otherwise
had been a season ﬁtll of injuries and dis-
appointments.

Pumping his ﬁsts to the crowd was a
symbolic gesture for Ricardo Greer. It was
an extraordinary show of strength and
courage for a freshman on an 11-17 team It
showed Greer was ready to join the ranks of
elite Big East players.

And it also gave a glimpse into the
future of the Pitt basketball program.

Greer’s outstanding freshman season
has given him reason to look ahead. He ﬁn-
ished the season third on the team in scor-
ing (12.4 ppg), second in rebounds (6.7 rpg)
and second in assists (117). His freshman
scoring average was higher than past
Panther greats Clyde Vaughan (7.1 ppg in
his rookie year) and Jerome Lane (9.1), not
to mention current great Vonteego
Cummings (6.4).

Yet he believes he can do more next
year.

“I’m very hard on myself,” Greer
admitted. “I know I could have done more
for the team. But I won’t give excuses for
this year. Adversity will help us face next
year.” .

The adversity Greer spoke of was the
rash of injuries that  the playing time
of Kellii Taylor,  Leslie, Michael Shin
and John Finneman.  lack of manpower
meant that Greer  fellow freshman
Attila Cosby had toitishoulder much more

responsibility than most ﬁrst-year play-
ers. “ —'

“I thought, in  situation, that Ricky
would come in and cbntribute right away,”
Head Coach Ralph Willard said. “Ricl(y’s

We capable of playing atftlris level. Most fresh-

men are not.”

Willard knew that Greer, who stands 6-
foot—5 and weighs 220 pounds, had the
physical maturity to start, but the coach

admitted that he didn’t expect Greer to log P

almost 35 minutes a game.

Greer said the amount of playing time
didn’t faze him

“All that freshman stuﬁ” went out the
window at the_ start of the season,” Greer
said. “We only have one senior. We’re all in
this together”.

After a lifeless ﬁrst half in which
Providence held as much as a 12-point
lead, the Panthers came out hot in the sec-
ond. With Pitt trailing by four points,
Cummings put up an errant 8—foot jumper
that looked destined to fall into the hands of
two awaiting Friar defenders.

Out of the corner of the paint emerged
Greer, who ﬂew above the taller Providence

players, pulling down the rebound bq‘ore
banking it 017‘ the glass for a basket. The
hoop cut the Friar lead to two points. Six
minutes later; Greer’s two free throws gave
the Panthers their ﬁrst lead of the game at
62-60 — a lead they wouldn ’t relinquish.

Willard has complimented Greer on his
work ethic and his ability to spend extra
time honing his shot before and after prac-
tice. But he is not the only coach to praise
Greer’s attitude and determination.

“He’s a very strong and conﬁdent play-
er,” Navy Coach Don DeVoe said “He’s
going to come up big for Pittsburgh in the
future.”

But maybe it was Rutgers coach Kevin
Barmon who summed up Greer most suc-
cinctly — “He’s one tough cookie.”

That “tough cookie” seemed to get

stronger as the season went on, and at one
point late in the season he had a ﬁve-game
streak of double—digit scoring games.

But the Vrllanova tournament game
proved to be Greer’s best statistical game of
the season, as he scored 23 points, while
adding 12 rebounds and 10 assists. This
contest was Greer’s ﬁrst collegiate triple-
double, but he was reluctant to call it his
best game because the end result was a loss
and the end of his freshman season.

“The Vrllanova game was tough,”
Greer said. “It showed me a lot for next
year, though. It showed me I can become
better than most of the players in our
league.”

Greer said that during the remainder of
the semester the team will participate in
individual workouts as well as weight train-

 

ing at least three days a week He plans to
work closely with Assistant Coaches Jim
Christian and Troy Weaver to improve his
ball handling. Greer plans to play more
point guard next season and give Vonteego
Cummings extra time at shooting guard.
After a missed Boston College free
throw, Greer brings the ball up the court,
giving Pitts usual point guard, Cummings,
a rest. Greer makes a nifty crossover step,
shaking his initial Eagle defender Storming
toward the paint, Greer encounters Eagle
forward Frank Rodriguez, whom he blows
past for an emphatic one-handed dunk. The
throw-down electrtﬁes the Fitzgerald Field
House crowd and gives the Panthers their
largest lead of the game at 41-18.

Once again the Wizards played
down to the level of their competition,
missing ﬁve of their ﬁnal eight free

Denver, which failed to score 100

If the Nuggets can’t find a way to
win at least two of these games — if
not games against the rest of the league

deserve to be banished from the league.

Erased from all NBA memory for-
ever.

No more trips to the Mile High
City for the other 28 teams in the NBA.

Have a simple draft a la the 1970s,
when teams were dropping into the
ABA like ﬂies.

Have a lottery between the teams
that don’t make the playoffs, and they
will then pick from the likes of Bobby
Jackson, Danny Fortson and Tony
Battie, to name a few of the Nuggets’
younger talents.

I know, my theory is an impossibil-
ity, but what can the Nuggets do to
climb out of the Western Conference
cellar? I
Only eight Nuggets have played
more than 50 games.

Only three players average double
ﬁguresin points. The Nuggets are with-
out a double-digit rebounder.

Not surprisingly, Denver ranks last
or close to last in almost every statisti-
cal category that a team tries not to be
last or close to last in. I

With all of this information about
what to do with the Nuggets, it’s
painful for a true basketball fan to real-
ize that it only takes one or two players
to drastically change a team in this day
and age of watered-down talent and
teams struggling to stay alive.

Add this to the fact that the NBA is
only a couple years removed from its
next expansion, thus adding more
CBAers to NBA rosters, and you are
left with the realization that we could
be using the terms “playoffs” and
“Denver Nuggets” in the same sentence
just like in 1994, when they battled
back from two games down to oust the
Seattle Supersonics in the first round of
the playoffs.

Haggerty ends Piﬂ career, looks to Olympics

Jay Yander
Staff Wrlter '

With” all the inﬂated egos and
salaries in sports today, it’s refreshing
to know that an athlete can still com-
pete out of sheer love of his sport.

Pitt senior Jon Haggerty recently
completed his college swimming
career, and although he didn’t qualify
for the NCAA championships, he’s not
upset in the least.

“I’m not disappointed at all about
this year,” Haggerty said‘. “I just wish
it didn’t have to end. The season went
by a lot faster than previous years.”

Haggerty ﬁnished his career with

several accolades, including the Pitt ‘

record in the 200-yard butterﬂy and 20
career Big East championship medals.

Among those medals are three
golds in the 100-yard butterﬂy, two
golds in the 200-yard butterﬂy, one
gold in the 200-yard individual med-
ley and three more golds as a member
of multiple relay teams.

“I’ve been very fortunate during
my career,” Haggerty said. “I received
seven medals during each of my
sophomore and junior seasons and six
medals this past year.”

‘ Haggerty has devoted the majority
of his time to swimming; he has
approximately four weeks to himself
during the course of an entire year.

“Swimming is a year-round
sport,” Haggerty said. “We get two
weeks off after the Big East champi-
onships and two weeks off after senior
nationals. Then I swim for my club
team during the summer. It’s pretty
draining.”

Haggerty will pass up attending
the senior nationals meet during April
and turn his attention to graduating
this summer. After graduating, he has
goals of qualifying for the Olympic
trials.

“I’m really concentrating on get-
ting out of school right now,”
Haggerty said. “That’s deﬁnitely my
top priority.” ‘

To prepare for the Olympic trials,
Haggerty will train in Florida, He is
only .07 seconds away from qualify-
ing in the 100-yard butterﬂy and hopes
the training down south will help him

reach his goal.
Because several of his Pitt team-
mates come from Western

Pennsylvania, Haggerty, an Allison
Park native, has enjoyed watching the
teammates he swam with and against
in high school improve throughout the
years.

“It was really nice to see the guys
grow up and succeed,” Haggerty said.
“I grew up swimming with Eric
[Stefanski of Wexford, Pa.], so it was
nice to see a fellow senior accomplish
what I did.”

After Haggerty finishes his

attempt to qualify in the Olympic tri-
als, his career goal is to coach swim-
ming. He realizes, however, that it will
take some time to move up in the
coaching ranks.

“I’d really like to coach here at
Pitt with [Head Coach] Chuck

[Knoles],” Haggerty said. “Coach.

Knoles has been a father figure to me.”

Haggerty ﬁrst met Knoles when
the coach arrived at Pitt in 1990. Then,
Haggerty was swimming for Knoles’
club team, Team Pittsburgh, which is
based at Trees Pool.

“Coach has helped me make a lot
of decisions with my life, including
going to Ohio University before trans-
ferring here before my sophomore sea-

son,” Haggerty said. “He’s a great guy.
He takes care of all of us.”

Away from swimming, Haggerty
has completed the Pittsburgh
Marathon twice during the past two
years. Although he isn’t planning on
running the 27-mile course this year,
Haggerty hopes to take on something
even more strenuous than a marathon
in the near future.

“I want to compete in the Ironman
Triathlon,” Haggerty said. “That is my
life—long goal, and I hope to do that
within ﬁve years.” a

. It wouldn’t be too much to say that
triathlon or not, Jon Haggerty is
what’s right about sports — hands
down.

games during the playoff race in late
September in lieu of a struggling
Allensworth.

This spring, Allensworth regained
his starting spot in center and his prein—
jury form. Once again, Ward will be rel-
egated to fourth outﬁelder, pinch hitter
and defensive replacement.

The other two outﬁeld positions will
be retained by 21-year-old Jose Guillen
in right field and team leader Al Martin
in left ﬁeld. Guillen comes off a solid
freshman campaign in which he hit 14
home runs and drove in 70. Martin will
try to bounce back from an injury-
plagued season to his 1996 fonn.

Pittsburgh’s lone al1—star, second
baseman Tony Womack, will again lead

' the scrappy Pirate offense. Womack,

who enters his second full season, led the
league in steals with 60 and set a
Pittsburgh record with 32 straight thefts

in a four-month stretch from April to .

July. .
Young will bat clean-up and start at
first. The 28-year-old last year spent his
ﬁrst full season in the majors since 1993.
In just 333 at bats, Young led the team in

. home runs (18) and RBI (74). In a

punchless offense, Young provides one
of the few power threats.

Jason Kendall, 23, enters his third
season as the Pirates’ backstop. The
catcher improved on his defense last
year, throwing out 40 percent of base
runners attempting to steal. He also set
personal bests in every offensive catego-
ry except batting average and triples.
Kendall’s 18 stolen bases were the most
by a catcher since Craig Biggio’s 21 in
1989.

The starting rotation of Francisco
Cordova, Esteban Loaiza, Jason Schmidt
and Jon Lieber remains the same —— just
subtract Steve Cooke and add Jose Silva
in the fifth spot. Rich Loiselle (29 saves)
will be the closer and Ricardo Rincon
(3.45 ERA) will be the setup man.

Their pitching staff could excel if
injuries don’t'upset it. But runs will have
to be manufactured again due to a lack of
power. Stolen bases, sacriﬁce bunts and
timely hitting will be the Pirates’ way in
‘98. Seventy or more wins should be
considered a success because they are
still two years away from being a real
contender. .

The Pirates open the season April 1
with a night game at Olympic Stadium in
Montreal. The home opener is April 7 at
7:05 p.m. vs. the Atlanta Braves.
