Mike Doyle and Rich Fitzgerald both
urged college students to stop crazy
people who think two plus two equals
ﬁve. ' _

“If you let crazy people say
crazy things, then you need to cor-
rect them,” U.S. Rep. Doyle, D—Pa.,
said Tuesday night to a room of 30
students. He urged the audience to
make sure students know the right
facts when it comes to political is-
sues. ‘

At the close of the meeting, Doyle
donated $1,000 to the host of the
event, the Pitt College Democrats.
The club brought Pittsburgh natives
Doyle and the Democratic county
executive candidate, Fitzgerald, to
the William Pitt Union for an hour-
long talk in View of the upcoming
November elections.

Doyle ended the evening by mak-
ing a surprise contribution of $1,000
to the Pitt College Democrats, who
as of Tuesday night had $250 in their
account, according to Pitt College
Democrats business manager Robert
Beecher. C‘

Doyle said he donated the money '
after he saw the turnout among stu-
dents and heard their great ques—i
tions.

“We were completely caught
off-guard by the contribution,” club

Students might soon have a new
way to elect their Student Govern-
ment Board members and an addi-
tion to the Outside the Classroom
Curriculum if the proposals put
forward at Tuesday’s SGB meeting‘
go into effect. '

Board members announced
a referendum to amend the SGB
Constitution to allow students to
vote for eight board members, as
opposed to the current ﬁve, at the
meeting in Nordy’s Place. If passed,
the amendment would go into ef-
fect for the 2012 election.

Board member Alex Zimmer-
man said that the referendum
would allow voters-to have the
ability to choose their ideal board,
which consists of eight board
members and a president.

“[It] encourages people to learn
as much -as possible [about the
people running] ,” he said.‘

Later in the meeting, Board
member James Landreneau an-
nounced a proposal that would
allow the OCC to give mini-grants
to clubs to hold events that fulﬁll
OCC requirements. Landreneau
said that the mini-grant would
help student groups promote those
events.

This mini-grant will be similar
to the Alcohol Committee mini-
grant but with a‘ lower monetary
cap, and the events will not have

Candidate Rich Fitzgerald (right) spoke
along with U.S. Rep. Mike Doyle (left) last
night in the William Pitt Union.

lon University graduate and president of the
Allegheny County Council, said he knows his
election in six weeks is “not as hot as a presi-
dential election,” but it is still very important.
The deadline for voter registration is Oct. 11. b
He drew comparisons between the Nov. 8
election — where he will compete with Repub-
lican candidate D."Raja for the county executive

seat — and next fall’s presidential race. T
“If I don’t win this race ..'. it’s not going to

 ‘ happen for Obama,” Fitzgerald said.

Fitzgerald and Doyle both stressed how
important Pennsylvania will be in the 2012
election, calling it a “critical state.” They said
that if Obama doesn’tw_in in Pennsylvania, then
he most likely will not win the White House.

Doyle said that young people were the rea-
son Obama won the presidency in 2008 and
that even though “we haven’t gotten everything
we’ve wanted,” in terms of campaign promises,
“the thought of one of the [Republican candi-
dates] becoming president scares me.”

“If we can’t get young people out to vote_in

the numbers we did last election, we don’t have «

a chance to win,” Doyle said.

Doyle, who graduated from Penn State in
1975-and has been in Congress since 1994, also
took time to discuss various issues plaguing the
nation, such as the budget, the economy and
the political gridlock in Washington. .

He said the debt ceiling vote over the sum-
mer, which led to the formation of a super
committee, was a “terrible mistake” that the
congressional democrats and President Barack
Obama compromised for.

.“I’m mad because we had a deﬁning mo-
ment for our party where we could have drawn
the line and shown a stark difference between
us and them,” Doyle said. _

He also said that there needs to be fair-
ness in thenational budget, which can be ac-
complished by making the tax code more fair.
The bottom tier will pay their share through
entitlement cuts, while the upper class will pay
through increased tax brackets, Doyle said.

“Those of us who have been fortunate inthis
world can give a little more,” he said.

He said that America should “invest in our
people” by fostering small and medium busi-
nesses and allowing them to grow and improve
the economy. But he said ‘that Republicans in
Congress stood in the way of that plan.

 

and Fitzgerald speak about voting’s import

“Party politics are coming ahead of what’s
good for our country,” he said, referring to
Obama’s American Jobs Act, which he said

* Republicans are not supporting.

He stressed that instead of gridlock, Amer-
ica needs to start making decisions.

Fitzgerald also took time to talk about
jobs. He said his mainfocus is to keep jobs in
Allegheny County by creating incentives for
companies to persuade them to stay.

He said that for the past 25 years, most
students left the region after graduating from
college because they couldn’tﬁnd jobs, himself

included. But in the past few years, he said that -

he has seen more people moving to the region
because of available jobs.

DiFiore said he was very pleased with the '

evening and that Doyle and Fitzgerald are both
“awesome.”

“This is one of the most successful meetings
in the three years I’ve been involved with the
clu ,” DiFiore said. I

For The Pitt News

John D’Agata prefaced his public read-
ing with a word of warning to the au-
dience that his paragraph transitions
may appear abrupt.

“Some may see this as sloppy, but
others may call it intentional. You can
decide,” the nonﬁction essayist said to
afullhouse Tuesday nightinthe Frick
Fine Arts Building.

D’Agata, known for his unique
writing style, read an excerpt from

« his book “About a Mountain,” which

he characterized as one long essay
with no real breaks. The readingwas
part of the Pittsburgh Contemporary

WritersSeries,whichrunsthroughout —

the year. .

The passage told the tale ofUAgata’s
experience in Las Vegas, where he trav-
eled to help his mother move into her

I new home. There, he became inter-

estedinNevada’s Yucca Mountain and
volunteered for the local suicide hot
line, two stories he weaved together
in the last section of his novel.

Geeta Kothari, director of the
Writing’Center, described D’Agata as
a writer with “rare intelligence and
artistry.” ’ h '

    

Before he began reading the pas-
sage, D’Agata gave the audience per-
mission to laugh at anything in the
book. -

“I feellikelhave to give permission
becausel haven’t before, and I’ve seen
people in the audience gigglingbehind

their hands because they felt it was .

inappropriate. It’s completely okay to
laugh,” he said. C

He spoke before an audience of
more than 100, who sat in silence for
the half-hour reading and laughed on

_ cue. The section he read detailed his

immersion in Las Vegas, where he
spoke to representatives of the De-
partment ofEnergy aboutaplantoﬁll
Yucca Mountain with nuclear waste.
Quickly the tale moved to the sui-
cide of Levi Presley and his fatal jump
fromthe top ofLas Vegas’ Stratosphere
Hotel. D’Agata’s volunteer work pro-
pelledhimto inve_stigatethe story after
hearingaboutit on the local news. His
investigationledhimtoasit-downwith
Presley’s family that he described in
detail, transcribingthe conversations
hehadwhﬂe sittinginthefamily’s'den,
watchingTV Landwith Presley’s ashes
onhis lap. . ' V
“This passage is risky because
‘About a Mountain’. is an essay, and by

reading something from the end, you _

s Essayist presents work I i

don’t see how I got here,” D’Agata said
before he started thetext, which he
read at the request of a student audi-
ence member. '

Sophomore Kimiya Memarzadeh

- said she found it difficult to follow the

frequent transiﬁons.

“He lost me at one point, but the
endingwas impactful,” she said.

D’Agat_a’s visit to Pitt was not his
ﬁrst. He said in his introduction that
he came to Pitt about 10 years ago to
give his ﬁrst public reading. '

“I rememberwhen I got the invita-
tion, I felt like a real writer because a
realvschool felt it was worthwhile to
invite me to speak,” he said.

Sten Carlson, managing director
of the Contemporary Writers Series,
said he was pleased with the tumout
to the event. ~

“I feellikewe had agreat response;
we ﬁlled the auditorium,” he said.

D’Agata has edited two antholo-
gies of essays and written two novels:
“About a Mountain,” and “Halls of
Fame.” He holds two MFAs in poeuy
and nonﬁction from the University
of Iowa, where he works as a pro-
fessor. D’Agata has also won several
awards including a Guggenheim Fel-
_lowship, a sizable grant given to artists
to pursue their craft. I

NCAA athlete

Are NCAAathletes merely majoringin

. theirrespective sports?

Some of the NCAA’s faculty repre-
sentatives have ﬁnally acknowledged
thatthere isaproblemwith majorclus—
tering, the phenomenon of multiple

student—athletes on a team choosing -

the same major. .

The representatives said in the
preliminary results of an NCAA sur-
vey that scheduling conﬂicts and the
progress~toward-degree requirements
—whichcallfor40, 60 and 80 percent
completion in the second, third and
fourth years of college — lead to major
clustering. ’

Pitt takes pride in its student—ath-
letes’ achievements, and rightﬁilly so.
Withallofthe time they devotetotheir
sports, its pretty amazing that more
than halfof them earned at least a 3.0

- GPA in the 2010-2011 academic year.

But if there is major clustering at
Pitt, how much effortis goinginto those
degrees, andwhatareoursuident—ath—
letes really gettingfromthistop—notch
university?

A 2008 USA Today study of ﬁve
prominent sports at142 of the N CAA’s

top—level schools examined which ma- .

jors upperclassman student-athletes
chose. Forateamoflo ormore players,

if25 percentofupperclassmen have the
same major; that constituted a cluster.
Forsmallerteams,33percentwas con-
sidered a cluster.

The results? A staggering 83 per-
cent of the schools had at least one
team with a major cluster.

Accordingto our own research, this
yeafs football team is cluster—free. Well,
sort of. _ .

Almost half of the upperclassmen
who publicized their ﬁitiire plans on
Pitt’s roster are majoring in commu-
nications or administration of justice.
That seems like a lopsided statistic.

Butthe phenomenon ofmajorclus-

tering is unfortunately in the nature of
college sports.

Michael Miranda, the NCAA’s as-
sociate director of research, told The
Chronicle that “If peop1e’s behaviors
are being inﬂuenced by the rules that
we’re writing  we have to look at
them.”

But we think that instead of more
rules, the true solution would be a
change of attitude. If fans would be
content with lower-'quality collegiate
sports teams and higher-quality stu-
dents, maybe student-athletes wouldn’t
feelthe needtopigeonholethemselves
intoan“easy”majorthat“everyone” is

5 should keep academics in mind

doing. But it doesn’t look like that will
happen anytime soon. 3

Nonetheless, wethinksmdent-ath-
letes shouldtakethetimetotitinkabout
life afcercollege, especially iftheyre not
going pro. Academics shouldn’t have
to be neglected, and students — re-
gardless of why they are here —— are
ultimately here to learn.

There’s no telling what the NCAA
will do about major clustering, a topic
thathasbeen discussedadnauseumfor
years, yet essentially left alone.

Butwethinktruechangeisamatter
of collective attitudes and priorities.
And those aren’t so easy to change. I

But perhaps we should all take a
break from our busy, sleeping—past—

of the stuff that really doesn’t matter
that much. To this end, we’re declar-
ing Oct. 11, 2012, the ﬁrst annual Day

incredibly easy to remember, -.- al-

Real men. cry—_- but onlyforthe rightreasons I

Andrew Kaback
Columnist

I am in desperate need of a good cry.
Not that I’ve ever actually cried, but
one of my friends told me that it’s
great. I mean, not that I’m friends with
people that cry, butl know a guy who
knows a guy. Point is, I really need a
sob-fest — but I am a man.

I know the place you’re in right
now: You want a girlfriend and a crew
to watch the game with. You want to
eat beef jerky, drink protein shakes,
smoke cigars and listen to rap music.
You want to look like the ultimate man
to the outside world. But I also know

‘about that shameful part inside of

you, the part that thinks ﬂowers smell
okay and that going to the bathroom
with ﬁiends sounds like ﬁm. I know ,
that you want to cry.

Fortunately for you, there is a ma-
jor loophole. No, I’m not talkingabout
the tax code; I’m talking about crying
code. Although equally complex, the
worst that can happen from breaking

the tax code is jail, whereas break-
ing the crying code brings eternal

shame to families for generations. It"
‘ is thus extremely important to know

the few times that it is okay to let the
raindrops go. ' '

There have always been excuses-

for letting it loose. There is a reason
that allergies suddenly became popu-
lar inAmerica, and one day everybody
needed eye drops. Iguess you thought
-“Toy Story 3” just happened to come
out during an economic recession.

The point is that we all search for
excuses to feel — wow, this is hard to
say — emotional. So we fake a sick-
ness or make up a disease that our
fabled Unclejohn has, and everybody
seems to pretend that it’s okay un-
til their tum comes up. It’s ‘a vicious
cycle, and one that has to stop.

So what am I saying? I’m saying
that instead of excuses, we need codi-
ﬁcation. I don’t care if you’re “having
a bad day” or the Cheeto went too
far under the couch cushion. If your

It is always acceptable to cry when
“Field of Dreams” is on. I don’t know
how many times I have heard voices

telling me to forget about my corn and '

build a baseball ﬁeld, but I know that
I’m retiring to Iowa to do it. There’s
something about this movie that
reaches deep into the soul of a man
and tortures it like a Guantanamo Bay
prisoner. Whether it’s the dream of
provingto your more ﬁnancially suc-
cessful family memberthat he’s a jerk

dr traveling the country to kidnap an -

ex-hippie, every guy needs the second
chance to have a game of catch with
their father. ” '

It is always acceptable to cry when
your dog has to go to the veterinar-
ian. Diamonds are probably more
appealing, but man’s best friend is a
priceless thing. I know that diamonds
are forever — or in America, about
half of them are forever — but dogs
do not come with alifetime warranty.
When threatened with the slightest
cough or split hair, it is essential that
you save your dog’s life. The only way

Edimorialroiielea

to do this, of course, is to hand said
dog off to a veterinarian. This way,
you get to feel like you served your
duty without having to actually do
anything. It’s kind of like being Ben
Aflleck in a Matt Damon movie.

It is always acceptable to cry when
a research project doesn’t allow the
usage ofwikipedia. Ugh. Have profes-
sors ever tried to do research without
Wikipedia?_It’s like asking us to read
a book without a Kindle. Wikipedia
is. right there. It’s calling your name.
It’s like it wants to write the paper for
you. Writingaresearch paperwithout
Wikipedia is like being transported
to the ’70s and having to go to the
library. It makes me feel like my dad
and get sudden urges to order beer
with 3.2 percent alcohol content. It’s

a sad fate for us all when PittCat is "

involved. _

Pitt needs lacrosse in ACC s

Greg Trietley
Senior Stajf Writer

With the move to the Atlantic Coast
Conference, Pitt is missing some-

. “ thing. _
No, not the rivalry with West

Virginia. Not the conference bas-

‘ ketball tournament at Madison

Square Garden.

The Panthers are missing la-
crosse.

When athletic director Steve
Pederson spoke to the media two
Sundays ago, he said that Pitt

- matches up wonderfully with its

new conference in the so-called
“Olympic spor’ts.’f Baseball, soccer,

wrestling, track and ﬁeld, swim‘-

ming and diving, tennis and so on
—— the ACC carri_es them all.

But the ACC also carries rowing,
golf and lacrosse. If Pitt wants to
ﬂourish in its new conference, now
is the time to expand.

Rowing and golf both present

logistical nightmares, but the major
obstacle for lacrosse — a'playing
ﬁeld —_has already been hurdled.
Pitt has lacked an on-campus
ﬁeld to support the sport since the
demolition of Pitt Stadium in 1999.
The soccer program and others‘,
went into survival mode after the.
stadium"s closure, which unequivo-

cally nixed any hope of major sports 

expansion for 10 years.

That changed with the Petersen _
Sports Complex and Ambrose Ur-
banic Field, a turf so new that fans
can still smell a hint of the recycled

tires from which it was made. The , A
space for lacrosse "is there if Pitt,‘-‘

chooses to use it.
Soccer and‘ lacrosse can both

utilize thelﬁeld because they playflf

in different seasons. Ambrose Ur-
banic Field can support a game
dimensionally, as it measures at“

120 yards long by 76 yards wide. A 
standard lacrosse ﬁeld is 110 yards

by 60 yards.
Pitt does not have to add the v

sport to ﬁt in with. its new confer-
ence, as only four of last year’s 12
ACC schools —— Duke, Maryland,
Virginia and North Carolina —— car-
ry both men’s and women’s lacrosse.

Virginia Tech and Boston College

only participate on the women’s
side. Syracuse, though, will join
the conference with Pitt and give
the ACC another strong lacrosse
program. ‘

The Orange won both the men’s

— and women’s regular season titles

in the Big East last year. It gives the
ACC ﬁve schools with men’s lacrosse
and seven with women’s. Pitt could
even those numbers out. 9

_. The Panthers don’t have to
look far for expansion guidance.
Current conference brother Mar-
quette announcedlast December
that it would add;Big.East lacrosse

Panthers face fist road test of Big East season

Torie Wytiaz
Staﬁ"Wri ter

The Pitt volleyball team will hit
the road for just the second time
this season when it travels to
Georgetown and Villanova for a
Friday—Sunday Big East series this
weekend. ,

The Panthers (11—6, 1-1 Big
East) have played the majority of
their matches at the Fitzgerald
Field House, only leaving town for
a three-match tournament at the
University of Central Florida.

Freshman outside hitter and
defensive specialist Cassandra
Congemi said the team looked
forward to getting on the road.

“Still, it is exciting to travel
and have the chance to win on
someone else’s home court.”

The Panthers won two matches
in the UCF tournament, so the

experience is not completely -

new. However, the implication
of Big East play puts much more
at stake. ,

“Every match in the Big East
will be hard-fought and competi-
tive,” sophomore middle blocker
Brenea White said. “We have to go

in to every match, home or away, '

with the same level of mental fo-
cus.” _ .

On Friday, the Panthers will
face conference opponent George-
town at the McDonough Arena
in Washington, D.C. The Hoyas
are led on offense by sophomore
middle blocker Annalee Abell and
on defense by senior libero Tory
Rezin.

Abell contributes signiﬁcantly
in nearly every category, including
points per set (2.55) and kills per
set (2.14). Rezin leads the team in
digs per set (3.95).

The Panthers will look to com-
bat those players with their own
offensive and defensive weapons.
Sophomore outside hitter Monica
Wignot has playeclpimpressively
for the Panthers inérecent match-
es, leading the team in kills in its
ﬁrst two Big East contests.

Freshman setté‘r3‘i.indsey Zitz-
ke wagnamed the Big East Fresh-
man of the Week for the second
time 'as'a'll'result of her impressive
perfofﬁfances.  ’

“Lindsey has really been able

to set the pace for the offense
consistently,” head coach Toby
Rens said. “She keeps us playing‘
at a fast tempo, which is what we
want to do.” . '

In the opening weekend of
conference play, Zitzke recorded
a double-double in the 0-3 loss
to Seton Hall with 44 assists and
a match-high 22 digs while she
earned four serving aces in the
3-0 win against Rutgers.

After the Georgetown match,
the Panthers will travel to Phila-
delphia to take on Villanova Sun-
day afternoon. The Wildcats have
already won their ﬁrst two Big
East matches against DePaul and
Notre Dame.

The Villanova team boasts a

balanced offensive attack, with
a three-class trio of senior Mag-

"V gie Mergen, junior Morgan Pet-‘

kovich and sophomore Allison
Williams contributing with kills
and blocks.

Rens said he wants to gener-

ate a balanced offensive attack
by making sure that all hitters are
involved,

“We want to work on getting
the ball to our middle’ hitters
more,” Rens said. “By distribut-
ing the ball, we can keep our op-

ponents off balance.”

Kiesha Leggs, a senior middle
blocker for the Panthers, ﬁnished
with 17 kills in this weekend’s two
matches, but Rens said she can
contribute more. .

“Kiesha has so much talent,’i_
Rens said. “It would be a waste to
not get her more hittable sets.”

For some of the players, prac-
tice this week will focus around
mental preparation.

“The biggest thing in prepara-
tion this week is to maintain con-‘
sistency in our practices,” Con-
gemi said. “We want to emphasize

_ the necessity of ﬁnishing strong

and reducing mental errors.”

White agreed with her team-
mate, especially on the impor-.,
tance of mental toughness on the
road. '

“We have the skills to play with
every team in the Big‘East, wheth-
er at home or away,” White said.
“If we can focus on one match
at a time and runour game plan’
efficiently, we will be successful

then move to the Big East —— or whatever the
conference becomes.

; Pitt doesn’t have to worry about confer-
ence uncertainty. If Marquette —— a school
with 10,000 fewer undergraduates — can
add lacrosse, so can the Panthers.

The sport has grown out of its niche in re-
cent years. There are 61 Division 1 programs,
including Provide'nce, Rutgers, St.]ohn’s, Vil-
lanova and Notre Dame. Pittsburgh isn’.t a
traditional lacrosse market, but neither is
New York City or Rhode Island, for the most
part. _ ~

Lacrosse is a popular sport on Long Island,
where Farmingdale High School won the 2011
Class A state title this,year.

Pitt has" already invested in new facilities
in its striving to set itself apart from other
athletic programs. An investment in lacrosse
continues that growth. .

Lacrosse surprisingly profitable. It’s
the envy of less publicizedqcollegiate sports:
ESPN carries the NCAA Division I Men’s La-
crosse Championship. The network aired 58
games on ESPN, ESPN2,- ESPN3 and ESPNU
last season.

Local support for the sport exists, both
at the high school and college level. Pitt has
a successfulclub lacrosse team that largely
ﬁinds itself and schedules its own games.

Michigan, an opponent last year in Pitt’s
club lacrosse conference, announced in May
that it, like Marquette, was stepping up to
Division I. '

The Wolverines will begin Division I la-
crosse play on the men’s side this spring and
on the women’s side in 2012-13. They will play
in the 41-year-old Oosterbaan Fieldhouse,
which used to serve as the practice facility for
the football team until it upgraded to a new
building in 2009.

0 Based on Michigan’s expansion plans, a
Division I Pitt program could have called the

I Cost Sports Center home, and nobody would
have questioned it. The Panthers, though,‘

have a much better option, and it’s sandwiched
between the baseball and softball ﬁelds. With
the Petersen Sports Complex and a new con-
ference, lacrosse makes all the sense in the

world for Pitt. I

Pitt splits ﬁrst two  
conference matches

Volleyball 4 7

 

Bobby Mizia I Staff Photographer

The Panthers opened Big East play with a loss to Seton Hall and a victory over Rutgers

regardless of where we play.”

Pitt successfully executed its game plan
in one game this past weekend as the Pan-
thers began conference competition by fall-
ingto Seton Hall and defeating Rutgers.

Pitt started out strong in the Seton Hall
match, earning a-25-22 victory in the open-
ing set. In that set, the defense led the team,
as the Panthers recorded four blocks to the
Pirates’ one.

In the entire contest," Pitt outblocked
Seton Hall 14-8.

Offensively, Wignot contributed eight of
the team’s 14 total kills in the opening set.
Wignot went on to lead all players with 20
total kills in the match.

Despite their early success, the Pan— _

thers were unable to sustain leads in the
remaining sets, and the Pirates won the
ﬁnal three sets with scores of 26-24, 25-18
and 25-22. 5

“We were deﬁnitely upset by the loss to
Seton Hall at home, especially since it was
our ﬁrst Big East match,” Congemi said.
“But with a match against Rutgers coming
up, we knew that we could not dwell on the
loss and that we needed to focus on the
next opponent.”

at Fitzgerald Field House this past weekend.

The Panthers dominated the match
against Rutgers in nearly every statistical
category, including kills, digs, blocks and
service aces as they earned set victories of
25-14, 25-16 and 25-9.

Wignot once again set the pace offen-
sively with 10 total kills while juniors Margy
Acton and Alexa Campbell led the defense
with 11 digs each.

Comparing the Seton Hall and Rutgers
matches, the Panthers acknowledged that
their improvement was due to both physical
and mental factors.

“When we came out against Rutgers, we
had a mindset that we did not want to lose
again,” White said. “That change in mental
focus, along with some game adjustments,
allowed us to get the win.”

The Panthers made an important ad-
justment in their serving. Against Seton
Hall, the Panthers committed 16 service
errors and earned ﬁve aces. That ace tally
increased to 12 against Rutgers. '

“We bounced back against Rutgers after
a tough loss,” White said. “We took control
of the game, and that is what we need to do
in the future, especially on the road.” g
