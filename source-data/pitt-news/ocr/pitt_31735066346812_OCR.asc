4«th ‘All-American’

Rating in 3 Years

The Pitt News has been
rated in the top category of
college» newspapers for the
fourth time in three yearsby

the Associated eCollegiate
Press. i

“All American” rating was giv-
en to the paper for September
through January publication. Six
other college newspapers received
the same rating.

This was the fourth “All Ameri-
can” award earned by the News
in three years. The Associated Col-
legiate Press, with headquarters
at the University of Minnesota,
sponsors two critical service eval-
uations a year. The latest was
their sixty—sixth session.

College newspapers are classi-
fied as to enrollment of school,
frequency of publication, and
status of school (four or two year
program).

Wins Nineteen

Since,1949, The Pitt News has
received nineteen honor ratings
from the Associated Collegiate
Press —~ fourteen “All Americans”
and five in the next highest cate-
’ gory, “First Class.”

A certiﬁcate indicating the
award was sent to the News
along with a newspaper guide-
book which gives a detailed
breakdown of the paper’s strong
and weak points. The American
Newspaper Publishers Associa~
tion will choose the best papers
from these in the “All Amer»
ican” category and award them
special plaques. .

The issues receiving the certiﬁ-
cate were edited by Julia 1VI.

Named after Dr. Carroll J. Amundson, a University fac-

ulty member since 1929 who

died last January 5, the new

chair was created in recognition of his “contribution to the

educational development of sev—
eral generations of students.”
The grant was announced at a

simple ceremony in Chancellor:

Lit.chfield’sroffice. Among those
present were Dr. Amunds0n’s wi-

t dow, the former Nora Sales; Rich-

ard Scaife, Mrs. Alan M. Scaife,

and several members of the fac-

ulty who were colleagues and
friends of the late professor.
Appointment Conditions

The endowed post will be

known as the
Amundson Professorship of En-
glish History. Conditions of ap-
pointment to it are as follows:
1. The appointment shall be
made in accordance. with estab-
lished administrative practices
following consultation with dis-
tinguished scholars in the ﬁeld
of British history.

2. The professorship may be
filled either by a scholar of well
established reputation or by a
younger man who has demon~
strated exceptional competence
and premise of distinction in
the field.

filled on a one-year visiting ap-
pointment basis until a term ap-
pointment appears to be in the
best interest of all concerned.~

appointment shall be reviewed

Dormitory Restrictions Examined

Curfews and other women’s dormitory regula-
tions have aroused the interest ‘of undergraduate
students and administrators. To present a broader
picture of the controversy, The Pitt News has con-
ducted a poll concerning letters written to them
about regulations stemming from the Dean of
Women’s Office.

The following is a polled cross section of various

,students and concerned persons.

“I agree with the two letters. We should be
treated like college women.‘ Their business is with
educating us. We are considered as women, but
not by the 12th floor. We are considered as adults
by word only. It is foolish to admit students who
are not capable of taking care of/themselves.”
Arts sophomore.

‘Hours Are Liberal’
“I don’t think anything is wrong with curfews.

 

The hours are quite liberal. I think the fellows
understand the regulations, it's just a few girls."
Arts senior.
“With respect to the letter in Monday’s paper,
I admit that the rules are less liberal than the
colleges with which she compared them, but they
are much more liberal than those at Muskingham
and other church related colleges. From what
I’ve heard she may be justified, but I don’t
know." Education Junior.

“I don’t feel Pitt is especially rigid because I've
had experience other places where girls were really
kept under lock and key with curfews: 11:00 Fri-
day, 12:00 Saturday, 10:30 Sunday, and 8:00 the

other days. For this reason I feel Pitt is lenient,

although of course I’d rather not have curfews.”
Psychology junior.

Registration
Hits 
For Spring

Richard Hodges, director of stu-
dent records, said that from all
indications this year the Univer-
sity will have by far the largest
number of full time students at-
tending the spring trimester since

' its inception.

Last year the University had
about 1700 full time students and

in 1959, approximately. 1450. Fig-

ures for this year will not be
available for another month which
will be the last opportunity for
the students to drop courses. ,
This year the total registration
has also gone up; with 4800 in-
voices processed, the records of-
fice still has to process another

.1200. In 1961 the registration to-

taled 5,400 and the year before

-that 5,026. The break up by

schools will be available next
week. ’
The number of women resid-
ing in the dorms has gone up
from 125 last year to 180 and
those for men declined from 110
last year to 90 this year. '

No Cins in the Fountain  

 

  

WHEN THE WEATHER turns hot the fountain on the Bigelow
Street side of the Cathedral begins to spout and students who are

Magazine Uses

Here For Story

By Susanne Eckman

S a r a y u d h Makphanijvahana,
Sam forshort, who is a University
student from Thailand, will soon
be featured in a “Parade” article
on foreign students in America.

“Parade” is a ‘Sunday supple-
ment to 70 American newspapers
and has a circulation of over 11
million. The article will be” writ-
ten in general terms, butwill use
the University as a focal point
and Sam as a typical foreign stu-
-dent.

Sam is a second semester junior
from.Bangkok, majoring in chem-
istry. He has been in the United
States since his last year" in high
school, which he attended partly
to learn English and to adapt to
America. .

Photographer Travels Abroad

Photographer for the article is
Ben Ross, a staff photographer for
“Parade” for. the. last 12 years. He
spent two days on the coast in
preparation for the article, and
then the days here at the Univer-
sity. He is now on his way to
Spain and Portugal.

Ross travels by plane, with a
writer or alone, and considers
himself a “composite photo-
grapher, - director. and produc-
er,” and his series of pictures
“sort of an individual produc-
tion.” The work is “moreipains-
taking, detailed, and requiring
more effort than regular news-
paper work.”

Next week Edwin A. Kiester,
Education editor for the supple-
ment, will be at the University to
write the article.

By RACHEL GOSS

Once Dr. Abe Laufe mentioned
before 175 students in his English
lecture, that a book had been
written without any “e’s.” He did
not know the author, title or date
of publication and could give no
further information.

One student in this freshmen
class challenged Dr. Laufe as" to
the existence of such a book. Dr.
Laufe maintains, “the story arose
because of the large lecture which
is a unique feature of the Univer-
sity and his desire to prove the
story true.” i

The problem was taken to the
head of the Reference Department,
Hazel Johnson who-took only the
fact that a book existed without
any “e’s” and came up with the
title and author. Dr. Laufe was
able to respond to the students

challenge successfully.

Ties Key

The book was written by Ernest

J iVincent Wright. He tied the “e”

key on the typewriter down and
proceeded to write “GadSby: a
story of over 50,000 words without
using the letter “‘e."’

Another illustration of the
miracles performed by the Ref-
erence Department and by Miss
Johnson occuredywhen a girl in

Dr. Laufe’s class discovered a
piece of writing which had no
title or author given.
Dr. Laufe said, “I immediately
thought of Miss Johnson and
brought her the piece. It was iden-

tiﬁed within a week, showing that‘

most information can be obtained
with simply the source.”
Aids, Students

Moral of these stories Dr.
Laufe maintains, is that students
should understand that Miss John-
son and the other librarians in
the reference department can be
of enormous aid when working on
a research paper.

“Miss Johnson offers an in-
valuable source if students have
logical and valid problems in
obtaining their information. The
entire department is ready and
able to aid all students,” Laufe
emphasized.

Asked how one goes about ob-
taining ‘this information, Miss
Johnson maintained silence and
claimed, “secrets of the trade.”

Memorial

. With her endowment of the Carroll John Amundson
Professorship of English History, Mrs. Alan Scaife has be-
queathed an educational memorial ,which students and
faculty at the University will long remember.

In a period of skyrocketing cos-ts, particularly regard-
ing faculty salaries, Mrs. Scaife has not only lightened a
financial. burden, but, imore important, has providedin:
centive to attract more competent educational talent——

’ talent which the exigencies of budget would not permit.’

Considering the number of rigid stipulations often at-
tached to college grants, the conditions of her endowment
allow a more than liberal latitude to the University for the
administration of her gift. The Carroll John Amundson‘
Professorship of English History is a tribute not only to the
late Dr. Amundson, but to the faculty which the new post
will supplement and the administration which will deter-

I mine its occupant.

Women s Woes?

“The twelfth flnor” has achieved a 6-4 victory over the
two explicitly disgruntled women students who recently
protested injusticesin the women’s dormitory regulations
through the ‘Letters to the Editor’ column of The Pitt News.

Although their ranks were bolstered with a sorority
housemother, a sign-in desk attendent and the head resi-
dent. of Schenley Hall, the Dean of Women’s Office seems
to have commanded a surprising degree of support from
ordinarily freedom-loving coeds. Our women’s code is not
nearly as liberal as those in the more elite women’s schools,
it was pointed out, but it is far more progressive than
regulations at the smaller, church-based colleges.

The question now is, will our code continue to adapt
to the needs, maturity and desires of University women?
Brunt of the responsibility here lies with the women them-
selves. I

that he would do all that he

“Ask your teachers. Sometimes they hear about a
lot of openings,” he said.

The senior looked around: he read the want
ads; he asked his friends; h-e spoke with teachers.
fMost ofthe teachers listened politely and shook
their heads -- they knew of nothing. A few talked
about how tough it was to ﬁnd a job in writing or
English. A very, very few wrote to people or gave
him names to contact.

The lnhumcm Humanity

The senior was surprised. He had friends who
were obtaining degrees in business administration
or engineering or other of the liberal arts, both at
his and at other universities. They all spoke of
many leads they had received from their teachers.
He wondered whyihis teachers seemed so disinter-
ester. English,’ one of the ‘humanities,’ seemed th
most inhuman of them all. '

For a while he thoughtthat his teachers did not

 

feel they should recommend him.“ But he found-

that most of his friends in English were having the
same problem. Some were Phi [Beta Kappa, more
than a little prominent in student activities, and
exceptionally talented persons. Their teachers took
no rnoreinterest in ﬁnding them jobs than his did
in helping him.

By Jim Hufnagel

Then he began to feel that perhaps English
teachers did not hear of openings in their ﬁeld or
that there weren’t many. But many of them wrote
and published frequent;ly,‘knew many persons who
would interview graduating seniors, and were occa-
sionally even asked to recommend qualiﬁed stu-
dents. Once, while he was speaking to a journalism
teacher, she received a call from a man seeking a
writer. She said no, she didn’t know of anyone
right then, but she would let him know if she did.
The senior knewof no one who ever got a’ job

through her, even though her desk was litteredwith 

letters from magazines, newspapers, advertising
agencies, and publishing ﬁrms requesting recom-
mendations. .

The senior was more puzzled than ever. He

\

could ‘see that job opportunities were not as plenti-

ful in English as they were in science or education
or other ﬁelds. Yet he could see that teachers ‘in

English were not trying to help their graduates as

much as teachers in the other disciplines.
Curious Ouandry

It seemed to him that the more persons who
received good positions after graduating from the
English department, the ‘more the'department’s
reputation would be enhanced. But his teachers
seemed almost ashamed to recommend students.

There were exceptions. A few teachers gained
a reputation for helping their students. Some per-
sons not on the faculty but connected with the
university were also more than helpful. But the
majority oflthe English teachers didn’t seem to
give a damn. ‘ '

The result, he found, was that English majors

. became black sheep. During their senioryear they

stood apart from the ﬂock,» alone and unwanted, and
watched the sheep in other ﬁelds obtain interview
after interview, reject several job offers and ac-
cept the one the best liked. When the black sheep
graduated they eventually found a fold for them-
selves. But, like the bitter black sheep that they
were, they saw no reason to report their experi-
ence back to the Englishpdepartment shepherds.
They wouldn’t help the other black sheep anyway.

So many of the students at

that the spring trimester is a

walking around like they were
participating in the Mardis Gras.
One .boy I noticed had on a
clean, pressedvcord suit with a
white shirt and a carefully knott-

combed and he wore sneakers
with large holes in them. '

‘Dismissed’ Student

Amused Over Mixup
Editor, The Pitt News:

“Good grief,” I said as I opened
the letter containing my grade

transcript, “I got an ‘F’ in Phys-
ics. Gad, a five credit course. And

I thought I was doing so well;

Now they’ll throw me out.”

The next day a nice, polite let-
ter did arrive, informing me that
I had indeed been thrown out.
But by then I had done some so-
ber thinking. I could not, for the
life of *me, recall taking any
course in physics for several
terms. I was receivingfull credit
for all the ‘courses 71 had enrolled

 

I wasn’t really surprised about
the slip up. I registered late—-
very late——the fourth of April to
be exact. It wasn’t that I hadn’t
tried before. I had been trying
since the fourth of January.

But somehow, for one reason or
another, the registration crew
didn’t get around to me until
April.’ When I went to turn in
my cards the girl told me, “1
shouldn’t accept yourmoney, to-
day’s the last day for paying fees.
You’re late.” Nice guys1_

Well, I’m happy to report I’m.i

Critics Hit Nesvisky-

Editor, The Pm News:

We always regret to see aper-

omnipotence. Namely, Mr. Nes-
visky’s “Unintentional Satire” on
his own mental capicity in the
“Review of Peter, Paul and Mary.”

From what he found to be a
miserable performance, Mr. Nes-
visky synthesized the
three morons whose

seemed to have good .aste in se-
lecting their songs.” Ironically
we found no good taste at all in
Mr. Nesvisky’s review.

Summer School Set

For Bright

Children

Exceptional Students of All Gradesto Join

School of «Education Program Here Soon
Model summer schools will be conducted this year for

‘youngsters from kindergarten through 12th grade whose

high IQ’s qualify them for advanced kinds of learning.

The purpose of the program, which is operated from late
June to early August by the University School of Education,
is to give children a uniquely fruitful experience in learning

and demonstrate the value, toe

schools of the future, of ideas in
education which are being devel-
oped today.

Attending students will become
acquainted with laboratory tech-
niques in science years earlier
than they normally would, gain an
insight into other cultures of the
world, and study under master
teachers who will utilize the most
modern ideas infcurriculum. and
instruction. _

Three Programs
Three separate programs will

constitute the summer program

which is also featuring “on site"
graduate study for area teachers
and school administrators.
Creative dramatics, anthro-
pology, and an exploratory sci-
ence course are scheduled for
study by gifted children whose
IQ’s are «a.bove,135. This pro-
gram. which will be held at the
Fall: School, will also include
numerous ﬁeld trips to labora-
tories and museums under the
direction of Dr. Earl McWil-
liams, head of the Winchester-
, Thurston Schools.

“Understanding Other Cultures
in Relation to our Own” is the title
of a five-week program to be held
at Overlook School in Baldwin.
Examining the life of African,
Slavic, Spanish-speaking, and En-
glish-speaking peoples will ac-
quaint the “child prodigies” with
foreign cultures, their art, music,
and languages. C

Junior and senior high school
students will participate in a pro-
gram of foreign languages, En-
glish, social studies, sciences,
mathematics, dcvelopmental read-
ing, and typing which will utilize
teaching machines, individual in-
struction, and team-teaching. No-
minal tuition, representing a por-
tion of the cost, will be charged
for all three programs.

Classes Held
For Principals

Elementary sch ool principals
from four states are attending a
workshop conducted by the Uni-
versity School of Education which
began Monday. The 25 partici-
pants from Pennsylvania, Ohio,
New Jersey, and Maryland schools
will be directed by Dr. Richard
Wynn, Associate Dean of the
School of Education.

Coping with simulated problems
as faced by the high school ad-
ministrator will comtitute a ma-
jor portion of the week—long ses-
sion.

Such problems as “What Role
should a principal play if a,citi-
zen’s committee organized by a
clergyman claims that textbooks
used by a school promote athe-
ism?” will be discussed.

Dr. Wynn, who participated in
a nation—wide study of the prob-
lems to be simulated, will be as-
sisted by Dr. Richard Carlson,
Senior Associate of the Univer-
sity Administrative Research Cen-
ter, and Dr. Edwin Hill, Associate
Professor of Education.

Review. of Manuscripts

Character

By IRWIN ROTHBERG
The writer in the 1962 edition
of Manuscripts has achieved mo-
mentary success with characteri-
zation. Single characters are un-
derstood, but no single story sus-
tains strong character contrast.

Theodore H. Althof, II takes
the sick joke and the Walter Mit-
ty dilemma into the realm of the
absurd as he projects his hero’s
feelings toward the wife Gladys.
It is the mastodan skull that
breaks the key to Althoff.’s puzzle;
his home reflects modernity as do
the television Flintstones.

Perhaps Gavaj provides the
ﬁnest characterization in Ann
Walko’s “Our Boarders.” He lives.
He is a giant who learns to laugh.
Then Mrs. Walko takes advantage
of her victory with him. Fedor
has the opportunity to start a
story that lasted all winter long,
“. . . to make certain Gavaj would
come downstairs every night.”
The story element may be weak,
but Gavaj is a triumph.
People Cough
The latest offering of the Eng-
lish department literary maga-
zine has its greatest effect with
the stories “A Place Prepared” by
Robert Davis and “Cold Gusts of
Wind” by Barry Gross.
Davis places his characters at

They can talk to each other

about the dead and leaving the

city and having been good friends.
And when Jo Anne says, “. . . I
think the funeral has done me

good.” C. J.’s answer is apropos;

“That’s what funerals are for; it
was for us, not for him.”

Fortunately for Barry Gross in
“Cold Gusts of Wind” he has cre-
ated Rabenstein. The man is

A FAST VVALK

Even Chancellor Litchfield knows it. It has become a
hallowed and comforting tradition at Pitt to look over one’s
shoulder to the past when searching for greatness in sport.

Of late it has become the tradition in the track sport
for the enemy to peer over their shoulders just to keep
track of the geographical positions of the laggards who post
as Pitt runners, but whose abilities travel incognito.

We have become categorized as a “soft-spot” by
greedy athletic directors seeking sure-wins. Last year
in the IC4A’s in New York, the tradition-steeped Pan-
thers garnered a quarter of a point, hardly a substantial
return on a financed tour of Manhattan fun houses.

The athletic department offers a lot of scholarships to
be given to a score of scoreless runners. Our distance run-i
ners, especially, have been a sorry bunch of nomads in

_ past years.

Merrily We Stroll Along

A few of them, tendered with tuition, room and books,
sway with the tell—tale motion of punchdrunk fighters as
they meander down the cinders in the mile and two—mile
runs in slow, crippled jogs.

Some pressure should be exercised. We shouldn’t be
serious about a sport that’s playing minor-league ball. It’s
amazing when you critically scan the Pitt athleticiscene that
there is only one high caliber team in the school, the football
tem, and they had a 3-7 mark in 1961.

Track nuts, despite the harrowing losses, cry for
more recognition. How can you recognize a team that
schedules four dual meets, and through the grace of
Zeus, had one cancellediby rain at Maryland.

Nobody comes to see the meets except mothers, fathers,
brothers, and uncles, and, of course, the AAU officials, which
is the only delegation. that can consistently outnumber the
Russians at a track meet.

When the Panthers claimed Arnie Sowell and John

VVoodruff they could not draw. So how are they going to,

draw with the likes of this year’s‘ outfit‘? Southern Metho-
dist may have had the right idea when they cut out all ath-
letic scholarships aside from basketball and football.
Wasfed $ 5 S

If such action was hinted here, perhaps scholarships’.

wouldn’t be doled out with such apparent carelessness. Too
many-“if” kids come to Pitt and develop into costly cream-A
puffs. ' , , .
We don’t like to speak in general terms like this, be-
cause it implicates all._ But the athletes on the team who,
are true trackmen know themselves. The Joe Friends, Vance
Varters and pole vaulters can be excused. But most of the
rest‘? Ugh! ' ' i
Frank Carver ought to schedule a meet with Oregon
or Southern Californit just to give local fans an idea of
what it’s like to watch "a shutout in track. It’s that bad.
Of course, in this school, the track fathers can claim
the winner of the highest athletic award in the whole school.
He’s a wonderful. boy, a top—notch student, and he couldn’t
even earn a letter on the mediocre team which we were
talking about.

Come to think of it, it is more comforting to look"

back at Arnie Sowell for solace.

“Pitching is at least 75 percent of the game,” a few base-
ball observers have commented. If this be the case, there is
no doubt as to what is causing the mediocore showing thus

* far of the touted Panther baseballnine.

Pre—season estimations of the team saw a power-packed

lineup with a strong and deep pitching staff. The hitters,

although not quite as good as ex-O
pected, still have been producing
enough runs to win most games.

“As it was though, they did
very little pitching while we

Lewis probably had Andy Alex,

Relay Failure

In their most recent outing, at

the Panther entry proved to be a

to qualify only one team for the
championship division, the half-

Vance Carter, Steve Munter, and
Bob Shanefelt streaked to a ﬁfth

  Big Rival Duquesne

Face Tennis Team

By FRED MARCUS
The Panther netmen play Duquesne this Saturday at 1

pm. on the Carnegie Tech courts.‘

Paul Stockhausen now occupies the number‘ one spot
for the Dukes. Following him are Robert Schmalz, John
Conroy, Paul Mutchler, Tom Semler, and Paul Stockhausen’s
sister, Elizabeth, who is the first women to play on a Du-

quesne tennis team.

Duquesne’s overall record now
stands at 2-3. Westminster pinned
a 7-2 loss on the Dukes last Sat-

urday, although Miss Stockhausen
managed to chalk up victories in

- singles and doubles for those two

Duquesne points. She has now
compiled a .4-1 record in singles
play.
Coach Lies
Dr. Samuel Hazo, «the Duquesne

coach, commented: “.Pitt’s team is ~ \

really loaded this season, and if’

we-beat them, we’ll have some-
thing to talk about. Also, a vic-.
tory over the Panthers would give
us that necessary conﬁdence to
carry us through for the remain-
derot the season.”
Next Monday, the Panther
tennismen will face what will
almost undoubtedly be their
roughest test when they travel
to the Naval Academy. Besides
being a battle of the teams
themselves, this match will fea-
ture two opposing coaches with

Last year five teams entered

winner. The teams played each

game a week for each. team.

One of the highlights of the
season was a student-faculty

Bemis would also like’ to have
individual competition in badmin-
ton, tennis, horse shoes and ping-
pong. Any student wishing to par-
ticipate in tournaments in these
sports should contact Bemis as
soon as possible.

He realizes that student enroll-
ment is down. during the spring
trimester, but he hopes the en-
thusiasm is not.

“I'm hoping for a turnout
similar to the response which
we had in basketball and track,”
he said. “In order to have an
organized form of recreation
available for students this sort
of thing has got to click.”

In order for it to “click" more
