Across the Nation

WASHINGTON — Despite a last
minute Democratic effort to delay voting,
Newt Gingrich won a very close rc—elec—
tion to his post of House speaker yester-
day. Gingrich defeated House Democratic
leader Dick Gephardt by a vote of 216 to
205, gaining just three more votes than
the necessary 213 votes to win the office.

Amidst unresolved ethical questions,
many House Republicans said they would
Vote for someone other than Gingrich on
the eve of the vote. However, when it was
time for Voting, only four representatives
voted for people other than Gephardt or
Gingrich. Six members voted “present,”
which means that they didn’t vote for any
particular person. Only four members,
including Gingrich, abstained from Vot-
mg.

Before the actual Vote for the position
of speaker, the Democrats tried one last-
ditch effort to stop Gingrich’s re—election.
They called for a procedural vote to post-
pone the speaker’s election until the
ethics case against Gingrich is completed.
The Republicans prevailed 222 to 210 in
the voting, allowing Gingrich to squeak
back into office. Associated Press

VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. —- Apparently,
the “vampire defense” won’t stand up in
court. A self—proclaimed Vampire was

sentenced to 26 years in prison Monday
for sexually molesting and biting teenage
girls whom he had recruited into his
“Vampire family.”

Jon Bush, a 27-year-old air condi-
tioner repairman, was sentenced on
charges of carnal knowledge, crimes
against nature, and indecent liberties. He
targeted teenage girls from troubled fam-
ilies and molested eight between the ages
of 13 and 16 from 1995 to early 1996.
The girls testified that Bush taught them a
game in which he was the vampire leader,
and the girls could become vampires by
having sex with him or letting him bite
them hard, leaving a mark under their
breasts. They also said that Bush often
walked around with his hands folded in
an X across his chest and wore fake fangs.

  Faculty request for health
care options loses speed

 

Greg Fischer

For faculty and staff
hoping to have a choice of

health care options,
progress on the issue
raised at the Faculty

Assembly meeting on
Nov. 5 has been slow at
best.

“Nothing has been

pdone since that time,”

said Benefits and Welfare
sub—committee Chairman
James Holland. “We have
a meeting soon with Blue
Cross to see what their
experience has been.”

Holland was referring
to a meeting scheduled
for Jan. 17, 1997. At this
meeting, sub-committee
members and Blue Cross
representatives will dis-
cuss how Blue Cross has
fared financially as the
sole health care provider
for the University.

At November’s meet-
ing, Assembly member
Nathan Hershey proposed
that faculty and staff
request the option of at
least two different health
care providers when a
new contract is made with
the insurance carrier.

“When a new contract
is made, we want there to
be a  free choice of
providers,” said Hershey.

Though there has been
little advancement of
Hershey’s motion, his
words represent the senti-
ments of most faculty‘ and
staff, who feel that there
should be more than one
health care option offered
to employees by the
University.

“There should be at
least two options,” said
Hershey. “Our basic con-
cern is that we at least
have our freedom of
choice.”

According to Hershey,
faculty and staff members
are concerned they will be
forced into one single

health care plan, like
employees at UPMC.

As of July 1, 1997,
UPMC employees will
have Tri—State Select Blue
as their only health care
Option. According to
Holland, this plan offers a
network of doctors cover-
ing the various new,hos—
pitals which UPMC has
been acquiring.

Pitt’s current contract
with Blue Cross expires
July 1, 1998. The
Assembly can make rec-
ommendations to the
administration about their
health care option con-
cerns, but Faculty
Assembly President Keith
McDuffie said that one
has to remember that the
assembly’s role is only to
advise, and there is no
guarantee they will get
what they want.

“The language of the
proposition says the
Assembly ‘strongly
urges’ the administration
to offer at least two health
care options," said
McDuffie. “Our role is
only advisory.”

Holland said he thinks
once the current contract
ends, the Blue Cross Tri-
State option will be the
one most heavily favored
by the administration.

“I would hope Pitt
takes a competitive look
at other options,” said
Holland. “I feel, though,
that there will be consid-
erable pressure to have
Blue Cross, with Tri—State
as the only option.”

He said this is a viable
concern, considering how
the administration han-
dled the availability of
Health America to its
employees.

According to Holland,
the Assembly expressed
its desire to have Health
America included as a
health care option, but the
administration decided to
cut it anyway.

Recyling program at Pitt
suffers from ”contamination"

_BeI'h _ Fisher

Reduce. Reuse. Recycle.

Those are the instructions we’ve been
hearing more and more about how to deal
with trash today.

But at Pitt, you might think “contami-
nate” was also on that list.

Consider the following information

gathered one day on campus:

- On the ﬁrst seven ﬂoors of the WPU,
nine of the 15 paper and aluminum
recycling containers were contaminated
in some way.

- On the ﬁrst four ﬂoors of the Cathedral,
15 out of 27 containers were contami-
nated.

Contamination occurs when something
other than the designated recyclable materi-
al is thrown in a container. When this hap-
pens, everything in the container must be
thrown in with the regular trash, and nothing
gets recycled. As Greg Garvin, recycling
coordinator for Facilities Management said,
“One monkey can spoil the show.”

But Garvin also said the above ﬁgures
are not representative of the majority of
campus buildings.

“Those are some of the most heavily
traveled areas on campus,” Garvin said.

 

“You’ve got people from the community
coming through who may not be familiar
with Pitt’s recycling program.”

Still, Garvin did concede that contami-
nation was a signiﬁcant problem.

“That’s the biggest problem any recy-
cling program faces,” he said “Frankly, it
frustrates the hell out of me.” V

And contamination was most often
found in the containers marked “Paper
Only,” as items ranging from phone books,
candy wrappers, and cups were thrown in.

However, what was most often found
in the paper containers was newspapers,
which are considered contaminants now
that the University is no longer recycling
them.

“Our recycler [Browning Ferris
Industries] is no longer accepting newspa-
pers because the market value is so low,”
explained Garvin.

But the sign on the receptacles simply
says “Paper Only,” and does not indicate
what is and isn’t acceptable. Most students
questioned didn’t even realize that newspa-
pers were not acceptable.

' Although it seems this problem could
be alleviated easily with a sign of some sort,
Garvin admitted he didn’t really have “a
good answer’ ’ for why this hasn’t been done.

Mark Nordenberg’s “leadership
team.”

“It is absolutely clear that
Southwestern Pennsylvania needs a
strong University of Pittsburgh,”
said Carter. “The strength of Pitt’s
programs, in turn, is increasingly
dependant upon private support.”

In July of 1995, Pitt contracted
an outside panel of university presi-
dents and fund raising officials to
assess its fund raising programs. The
panel said that Pitt wasn’t raising the
money it should be.

According to

posed projects —— ranging from the
construction of a $52 million sports
convocation center to repairing
existing buildings —— the University
began looking for a person to lead
their declining financial campaigns.

“I found her to be a capable and
inspiring manager,” said Nordenberg
in a Jan. 6 campus update, “an artic-
ulate and effective representative of
the University, and a devoted and
hardworking professional.”

Service said that Carter will
bring a great deal of experience and
training to her new job.

Carter will be leaving a similar
position that she’s held since 1989,
associate vice president for develop-
ment and director of individual giv-
ing, at Carnegie Mellon University.
From 1986 to 1989, she was director
of development at Pitt’s Law School.

“Few positions are more impor-
tant to sustaining the strength of the
University,” said Nordenberg, “and I
am confident in Carol Carter’s abili-
ty.”

In a Dec. 21 article of the
Pittsburgh Post—Gazette , Carter said
she wants “to create a relationship
with the trustees, to find out what
they’re most interested in, and what
they think the objectives and vision
of the University should be.”

Carter is a graduate of Western
Maryland College and has her M.Ed.
from the University of Maryland.
She also has a certificate from the
Tuck Business School Institute in
Executive Management.

She will be replacing Margaret
McDonald, who has served as in the
interim for the past 14 months.

“We don’t want to put handmade signs
on the containers,” Garvin said. “And we
don’t want the cans to look like a ‘76
Volkswagen beetle.”

And although Garvin said he’s had “no
problems” with Pitt workers cooperating
with the recycling system, a BFI employee
reported that his company does ﬁnd some
contaminants in its Pitt collections.

“It’s improved a little bit,” said BFI
Operations Manager Jim Cassidy. “But
tl1ere’s still some contamination —— not so
much in food waste, but in things like text-

BFI has been handling Pitt’s recycling
for about eight months now, and Garvin said
slip—ups are “bound to happen” over the
course of a system.

And although the WPU worker
thought students, faculty and staff were con-
tributing equally to the recycling problems,
Garvin disagreed.

“Our staﬁ° and faculty do a better job
than students hands-down,” Garvin said.
“It’s easier to persuade them because

arson.

Part II offenses include less seri-
ous non-violent crimes such as
forgery, fraud, embezzlement, van-
dalism, weapon violations, prostitu-
tion, minor sex offenses, narcotics,
gambling, DUIs, public drunkeness,
disorderly conduct, underage drink-
ing, and others.

In total Part I offenses for 1995,
Pitt had 612 total calls and had
cleared 166 of them for a clearance
percentage of 27.1 percent, com-
pared to Penn State’s 16.3 percent,
Temple’s 6.4 percent, and University
of Pennsylvania’s 5.3 percent.

they’re employees of the University, and
they sort of have to do it.”

An employee from Pitt’s Computer
Accounts department in the Cathedral
agreed with this and said that people on her
staff were doing their part.

“I think the program is working,” said
Dee Mussman. “People separate their paper
in the ofﬁce, and then bring their aluminum
cans to the container out in the hall.”

But there seems to be a contrasting lack
of interest in recycling on the part of stu-
dents. And the fate of Pitt’s Recycling Club
may be most indicative of this.

Started just last year, the Recycling
Club disbanded this semester due to a lack
of student participation.

“We were getting, at the most, ﬁve peo-
ple at meetings,” said former president
Melissa Schaefer. “You need 10 people
signed up to be recognized as an official
clu .”

Schaefer believed a lack of awareness
was a big factor in the club’s failure.

“'Ihere’s just not enough resources,”
she said. “People hear things about recy-
cling but don’t take them to heart or realize
their importance.”

Schaefer and other former members of
the club have now joined forces with the
SGB Environmental Committee, which is
focusing on recycling issues on campus.
Some members of the Student
Environmental Action Coalition have also
been working on recycling issues with the
Committee.

And while it began as just an ad hoc
committee, the Environmental Committee
was ’ recently voted a more—permanent
standing committee by SGB.

Currently, the committee is working
towards increasing recycling awareness
among students, particularly in the resi-
dence halls.

“We will be sending out newsletters
soon,” said Laura Frecon, the
Environmental Committee chair. “The
problem is that a lot of people don’t even
know about the recycling resources that are
available in the residence halls.”

State showed a 57.4 percent, Temple
37.2 percent, and University of
Pennsylvania 18.9 percent.

“I believe the more we stress the
Part II offenses, the bigger impact it
has on Part I offenses.” said Boyd.
This means not letting the little
things slide, like underage drinking
on campus.

Boyd also attributes the success
in maintaining a relatively low crime
rate to the increased awareness of
student safety, the professionalism of
the department, and Pitt’s dedication
to hiring more highly trained police
officers. Pitt has also contributed by
spending a half—a—million dollars to
enhance campus lighting in the past
few years.

Because the ﬁre has been ruled an

they could not release the resident’s name,

“lt’s clearly an accident, and the resi-

The student could face penalties for

“That matter is still under discussion,

be taken into account.”

Donham said that quick student
action helped prevent this accident from
turning into tragedy and praised student
Justin Reitz, who reported the fire, and the
rest of the Tower C residents for their
cooperation.

“Students were obviously inconve-
nienced during ﬁnals week which is the
worst possible time,” he said. “But they
were definitely easy to get along with and
cooperated beautifully, preventing this
from turning into a real tragedy.”

Larry Keller, director of environmen-
tal health and safety, said the building’s
specially designed concrete walls pre-
vented the blaze from spreading through
the rest of the dormitory and causing
more damage and injuries.

“The building construction develops
fire compartments which control the
blaze in one area for a given period of
time,” Keller said. “The walls, ﬂoors, and
doors are fire resistant, made of concrete
and wood treated with anti—com—
bustibles.”

Though the furniture and doors on
the rooms are
wooden, Keller said
they are fire resis-
tant and also help
prevent fires from
spreading through
the rooms.

“The wooden
beds will eventual-
ly burn if it gets hot
enough, but it takes
a very high temper-
ature,” he said.
“The wood they’re
made out of will not
catch on fire very
easily. If it does ignite, it wont spread
quickly, and that helps contain the dam-
age.”

Keller said the stairwells are also spe-
cially designed to protect evacuating stu-
dents in the event that a fire were to

“The stairwells are designed with
fire—doors that can withhold intense
ﬂames and temperatures for up to two
hours. More than enough time for stu-
dents to safely evacuate the building,”
Keller said.

Keller and Donham said the room is
being restored and that the structure of the
building was not seriously damaged.

“The walls themselves were covered
with soot and may have degraded a little
from the heat, but they can be restored,”
Keller said. He agreed that a new coat of
paint and some
carpeting are all
that is necessary to
refurbish the room.

Keller said the

lucky that there
was minimal dam-

Diplomatic immunity is a principle which needs to be defended

Diplomatic immunity: an out-
dated ideal, or a higher principle
that should stay as it stands?

Last weekend, a Georgian
diplomat was involved in a car
accident along Embassy Row that
resulted in the death of a 16-year-
old girl. There are suspicions that
the diplomat may have been
intoxicated and speeding.

Under the current constraints
of diplomatic immunity, the
Republic of Georgia must waive
the diplomat’s immunity in order
for him to be prosecuted if the
investigation of the accident
gives cause to believe that he was
indeed responsible. This calls

 

   

into question the feasibility of
diplomatic immunity.

What is the basic principle
behind diplomatic immunity? It is
to ensure the safety of dignitaries
who must serve in countries other
than their own. These dignitaries
need to be assured that they will
not become political tools used as
hostages against their own coun-
tries. Cultural -differences must
also be respected. Certain things
that are crimes in one country are
not crimes in another. For exam-
ple, it is not a crime in the United

  
 
  
  

States for a woman to go out in
the streets without a veil covering
her face. In other countries, it is.
Diplomatic immunity is a
principle which must be protected
for the safety of those who serve
in other countries as well as for
the continuity it preserves within
the diplomatic community. If a
crime is heinous enough that the
people of the country in which it
is committed feel the necessity to
try it, there is the option of asking
the diplomat’s home country to
waive the immunity of that diplo-

mat. Perhaps if that country
refuses to waive immunity and
the country in which the crime
was committed cares to take the
case further, it could be referred
to the International Court in the
Hague, which tries cases such as
those against Serbian war crimi-
nals.

As there are plenty of
avenues within the current sys-
tem, there is no need for it to be
destroyed and rebuilt. Diplomatic
immunity is a principle that has
been as worthy in practice as it

has been in concept. As the say- .

ing goes, if it ain’t broke, don’t
fix it.

attending
Congressman Bill Coyne’s post-
election party two months ago, I
met a regular reader of ours of

And that’s a big problem.

We in the media get blamed
for being “biased” in what we
publish, whether in reporting or in
editorials. We hear it from black
student groups, feminists, politi-
cally conservative Christians, and
just about anyone else with a deep a
commitment to a particular agen-

ple are correct, as none of us —
can be totally

However, if you think it’s our
job to be your public relations
organ or to tell you what you want
to hear, let me tell you from the
outset you’ve come to the wrong
place. Furthermore, be advised
that when we express an opinion,
as is our right, we do so with the
facts we have available to us at the
time. And don’t think we haven’t
heard your arguments; we have.

page did take a sharp right turn
last year, and even though I don’t
agree with much of that agenda, I
enjoyed a very professional rela-
tionship with both Opinions
Editor Erika Kendra and Editor-
in—Chief Mark Gordon, who were
largely responsible for that shift.
And more importantly, they never
told me that I, as a columnist, had
to reﬂect their views. In fact, I
was somewhat surprised to learn
that Erika read me on a regular

Also, about 2 1/2 years ago, I
wrote here that the black commu-
nity didn’t really want to deal with
racism (an opinion I still hold),
thus generating two written rebut-
tals and, I was told, 20 or so nasty
phone calls. One militant black
student even asked me, “Did [The
Pitt News] ask you to write that?”

We need to respect each other’s opinions

(Of course not.)

As it was, my legion of critics
probably never bothered to look
at my evidence, because it might
deliver a message they may not
want to hear. The truth be told,
whether right or wrong, everyone
has a right to be heard on issues of
race. If you have a problem with
that, well, you have a problem.

Some would suggest that
some viewpoints ought to be
squelched not simply because
they may be offensive but
because of the perceived power
they once had (witness the Ku
Klux Klan’s attempt to place
creches in 15 county courthouses
around Pennsylvania last month).

But I think it was the late
Sydney Harris who said, “You
cannot kill an idea with force,
only with another idea.” One rea-
son Martin Luther King Jr.
enjoyed so much success with the
civil rights movement was
because he made his enemies look
like idiots without trying hard. On
the other hand, if black students at
a California university whose
identity escapes me thought they
could end the debate on affirma-
tive action by stealing every copy
of a student newspaper with an
editorial supporting its demise,
someone should have advised
them that, in doing so, they may
have been trying to put out a fire
with gasoline.

My roommate, a conserva-
tive and frustrated journalist him-
self, is fond of the following
quote: “I may disagree with what
you say, but I’ll defend your right
to say it.”

SPORTS

Look what was
under the tree

 

Sports fans, welcome back to the
University of Pittsburgh — now oﬂicially
re-christened the Walt Hanis Admiration
Society.

As of Dec. 16, your Pitt football

Panthers have been under new manage- a
' ment. The press release came the day after

ﬁnal exams ended, so many out-of—town
students have found out only recently that
the new athletic director actually found
somebody with a pulse and coaching expe-
rience that wouldn’t turn Pitt down ﬂat.

That’s the good news. The bad news is
that nobody knows who Walt Harris is. In
fact, “Who’s Walt Harris?” is rapidly catch-
ing up to “So, how was your break?” as the
most popular saying on campus.

First, to answer the most common ques-

tion, Hanis is not related to Walt Disney. He ’

is not the same Walt Harris who plays in the
Chicago Bears secondary, nor is he Walt
Garrison, former Dallas Cowboys running
back.

He is, however, an oﬂ°ensive master-
mind. As quarterbacks coach at Ohio State,
Harris helped create the olfense that scored
126 points in two games against the
Panthers.

He coached under Bill Parcells and
played under Buddy Ryan. He developed
Bobby Hoying and Tony Eason —— good
news for Tony Zimmennan. As quarter-
backs coach of the New York Jets, he re-
developed Boomer Esiason —— good news
for Matt Lytle.

And, in what might have been his‘ ﬁnest
hour, he left the Jets before Rich Kotite took
over. That’s good news for everybody.

His limited head coaching experience
came with the now-deﬁmct Paciﬁc Tigers
football squad, and included some national-
ly-ranked offenses. His Pitt ties go back to
his ﬁrst game with the Tigers, which were
demolished in 1989 by the last Panther team
to reach a bowl game.

While he might not have the name
recognition of a Matt Cavanaugh, a Mike
Ditka, a Jackie Sherrill or a Mike Kovak (a
sentimental choice around the office), Harris

Panthers tab new head man to replace Majors

Malt Grove



.~. .-. ~«.~.«.. A ~. ¢.

When Johnny Majors stepped
down as‘ the leader of the Pitt football
program, ﬂedgling Athletic Director
Steve Pederson had his work cut out for
him.

Who would be the next head coach
of a program in the condition that Pitt is
in? Why would the likes of Matt
Cavanaugh or Mike Ditka leave their
current jobs just to show a little school
spirit and take over the extremely rnis-
guided reigns of the team we see
embarrassed on a regular basis?

There were some names thrown
around by Pederson and the media, but
one that didn’t surface until late in the
hunt was the quarterback coach at Ohio
State, Walt Harris. Get used to that
name because he’s the top dog of Pitt
football now that the Buckeyes are
done celebrating their Rose Bowl win
over Arizona State.

 

As the 33rd head coach at Pitt,
Harris has his work cut out for him,
taking over a team that has managed
only 10 wins over the past four sea-
sons.

As an integral member of John
Cooper’s staff at Ohio State, Harris saw
his team win more games in one season
(11) than Pitt has since 1993.

One of the brightest stars under
Harris’ tutelage was Bobby Hoying,
now with the Philadelphia Eagles. In
1995, Hoying threw for a school-record
3,269 yards and 29 touchdowns. The
offense as a whole averaged 451.1
yards per game, good enough for 16th
in the country.

Harris began his coaching career at
El Camino High School in California
and has had stints at many top pro-
grams around the country, including a
job as Johnny Major’s assistant head
coach offensive coordinator at
Tennessee from 1983-1988. Harris
returned to his alma mater of Pacific in

1989 to become the head coach for
three seasons, and in 1992, he became
the New York Jets quarterback coach, a
stop that lasted three seasons.

With a superior resume compiled
and obvious offensive talents, the
Panthers returning to play under Harris
are excited for the future of the pro-
gram.

man Justin Wade said. “I give him

team that he beat 72-0 last year. We
only lost two seniors that contributed
last year in Nate Cochran and Curtis
Anderson and we’re a really young
team. Plus he’s brought along some
guys that he recruited to go to Ohio
State.”

Over the past few years, the
Panthers have been mainly a running
team with the likes of Curtis Martin,
Billy West, and Dwayne Schulters. The

the same time, if the gift-

This game bore a strik-
ing resemblance to some of
the contests I’ve seen in
youth hostels around the
Western Pennsylvania area
over the past few months.
In a first half that could put
Gilbert Gottfried to sleep,
the Panthers stumbled to a
15-point lead that they took
into the locker room. The
team that came out in the
second half looked a lot
like the Steelers did against
the Pats: dazed and con-
fused. The Panthers blew
the big lead and managed to
drop the first of a series of
what were thought to be

 

gimmees, with a final score
of 58-55. Vonteego
Cummings led the Panthers
with 20 points while bud-
ding star Mark Blount
pulled down 14 rebounds.

There isn’t much to say
about the team that CMU
brings to the table when it
comes to men’s basketball
except that I do believe that
I could play for them, and
that’s pretty bad. Pitt began
this game in what seemed
to be an academic awe of
the Tartans, a team named
in honor of a Scottish fab-
ric. Hands down, CMU was
one of the worst assem-
blances of men that I have
seen since Sept. 21 in
Columbus. Every player on
the roster saw time, and
moonlighting Leon Murray
even knocked down a three-
pointer in the waning
moments of the 84-39 drub-
bing. Jason Maile and
Kellii Taylor each had 13
points while Blount
grabbed 13 rebounds.

scheme might change once the new
regime sets up shop on Cardiac Hill.

“I think we’ll put the ball in the air
more,” Wade said when asked about the
offensive planning of Harris. “Until we
win he’ll have to make it exciting and
that means putting the ball in the air. We
have some good guys at the receiver
position with Jake [Hoffart], Vital
[Joseph], and John Jones. Chiffon Allen
will be back after sitting out for Prop 48
reasons last year, too.”

Tony Zimmerman, the highly touted
sophomore quarterback from Penn
Trafford High School, feels that the
addition of ' a coach like Harris could
really change the Panthers entire view of
football, both on the ﬁeld and off.

THE PITT NEWS

“He and the offensive coordinator
both seem to be very good offensive
minds, and Harris is an especially great
quarterbacks coach. He has coached
some great players along the way,”
Zimmerman said.

“I think he’ll bring a change of atti-
tude to the team and give a new start to
players who had lost hope.”

Harris has wasted little time in get-
ting a new and improved staff together
to bring the Panthers back to the surface
of the college football world.

Brian Williams, formerly the line-
backers coach at Cincinnati, will replace
Bob Babich,.who served under Major’s
as linebackers and special teams coach.

Vincent White replaces Gary Nord

 

as receivers coach after only one year
for Nord. White spent the last two sea-
sons as the receivers coach and academ-
ic liaison at Southern Methodist (1993
and 1995). White worked with Harris at
Paciﬁc in the early 90s as the receivers
coach and passing game coordinator.
White was a receiver at Stanford during
the John Elway era where he led the
country in receptions in 1982. White
was drafted by the Jets in the sixth round
of the 1993 draft but opted to play two
season for the Denver Gold of the now-
defunct USFL. He was an assistant
coach for the Denver Dynamite of the
Arena League for one season, and the
-team led the league in virtually all offen-
sive categories. ’

Steve Mooshagen is listed as one of

serve him well as the new offensive
coordinator for the Panthers. He comes
to Pitt after serving one season as the
head coach, offensive coordinator and
quarterback coach, at Fresno City col-
lege. Before that, he served as the
receiver coach at Fresno State.

One of the survivors of Major’s
staff will be recruiting coach Curt

in the nationally—televised games that have
the most eﬁect on recruiting. In short,
SportsCenter has more video clips of 1996
Pitt opponents scoring than the Dallas police
have of Erik Wrlliarns scoring.

Now, maybe Harris can treat the fans to
some old—fashioned shootouts —— an easy
way to get the fans interested again. The
most exciting game last season was the 53-
52 homecoming extravanganza against
Temple; it would be fun to see a similar
game against a quality opponent in the near
future.

Alas, we’re still more than three months
away from the spring Blue-Gold scrim-
mage, which gives us lots of time to re—ignite
Pitt pride and oifensive optimism at the Walt
Harris Adrniration Society:

Could the team average 30 points a
game?

Could Zimmerman or Lytle earn
national recognition? ,

Could the Pitt Panthers become the
Carolina Panthers of NCAA Division I foot-
ball?

As most of us are just getting
back into the swing of things here at
Pitt, the women’s basketball team
played their third game of the new
year. The Lady Panthers defeated a
quick and athletic University of
Miami team at Fitzgerald Fieldhouse
Monday night, 64-59.

The Lady Panthers got off to a
quick start, as they outscored the
Hurricanes 13-4 in the opening
seven—and—a—half minutes. By the
half, Pitt extended their lead to 30-
14. The Lady Panthers defense held
Miami’s leading scorer, Octavia
Blue, to only one point, and their
other scoring force, Desma Thomas,
to none in the opening half.

Pitt had toifeel pretty good going
into the locker room, as they ended
the half on a layup by Kortni Webb.

The Lady Panthers set a lot of
picks against a very aggressive
Miami defense. Coach Kirk Bruce
said this was the plan. He said, “This
is an aggressive team, and they over-
play a lot.” Coach Bruce wanted to
run what he called “a misdirection
kind of thing. In other words, when
the forward goes left, a guard sets a
pick from the right. This will keep
that pursuing defense honest and on
their toes.”

Pitt held their lead through the
second half. Miami began to crawl
back, but Pitt would not let the
Hurricanes get any closer than four
points. In the second half, the Lady
Panthers shot 13-17 from the free-
throw line to seal the win.

One of the keys in Pitt’s win was
forcing Miami to take long shots.
The Hurricanes are a good inside
team, but the Lady Panthers forced
them to take 16 three-point shots.
They only made four. Bruce said, “I
don’t think this was by design.”

Once again, Coach Bruce used
all of his players in the game, except
Nickeia Morris, who injured her
ankle. Bruce got solid play from all
of the players on his bench.

Gina Montesano led the way for
Pitt with 24 points, as Missy
Thompson followed with 12.
Montesano went down in the second
half with a knee injury and will miss
the game Tursday against
Georgetown but hopes to return
Sunday. The Hurricanes got a career-
high 22 from Kym Hope and 18 from
Desma Thomas.

Coach Bruce waspleased with
the three players he had in double
figures. The third was Latia Howard
with 12. He said, as he looked at the
stat sheet, “That’s more like it! We
have three players we are depending

Festive holiday season won't
weigh down Panther wrestlers

 

In early October, the Pitt wrestling team
began what has become a seemingly endless
barrage of practices designed to prepare
them for their grueling season. '

Three months later, the Panthers have
competed in only two duel meets and a cou-
ple tournaments here and there. Now is the
time when the Panthers get down to business
and the meat of their schedule.

The team began the season with a 28-6
thrashing of Bloomsburg and then an
impressive fourth—place ﬁnish in the Lock
Haven Invitational.

As 1996 dwindled into its ﬁnal days the
teams’ competition stiffened as they fell to
13th—ranked Nebraska, followed irnmediate—
ly by a disappointing 14th place ﬁnish in the
42 team Las Vegas Invitational on Dec. 6-7.
However, four Pitt grapplers ﬁnished among
the top eight in their respective weight class-
es in Vegas.

John Withrow ﬁnished ﬁfth at 167
pounds, Mark Bodo placed sixth at 190, and
eighth place ﬁnishes were wrapped up by
158 pounder Jacob Schaus and 177 pounder
Bryan Matusic.

‘The Las Vegas Invitational is a tough
tournament; it’s one of the toughest in the
country,” Head Coach Rande Stottlemeyer
said. “We wrestled okay, but we weren’t
great. It could have been a lot better.”

Those early December setbacks seem
like ancient history to the Panthers now. A
month has gone by, and the team is about to
embark ona stretch in which they will wres-
tle 16 teams by the end of February. Included
in this marathon is the bulk of the team’s all-
important Eastern Wrestling League sched-
ule as well as clashes with Big 10 foes Ohio
State and fourth—ranked Penn State.

The increase in the concentration of
matches coupled with the after-effects of the
lengthy holiday break means an increase in
the intensity of the practices.

“There has deﬁnitely been an increase
in the intensity level. In fact, we started 6:30
a.m. practices yesterday,” Matusic said.
“Since there are more matches, there’s less
time for practice, so we have to go at it hard-
er.” -

“They [the coaches] are putting a lot
more emphasis on conditioning,” Schaus
added.

Physical conditioning carries increased
importance this time of year because if the
wrestlers are not careful, the festive holiday
season and the abundance of fattening foods
can prove disastrous.

“Most guys are at their high schools and
run on their own while they’re home for
break,” Matusic said. “It’s hard to get a real
good workout like that.”

Hopefully that means the wrestlers will
be hungry enough to devour the competition
in the weeks to comes.

Pitt again with 19 points and the 7-foot
wonder Blount dominated the boards
with nine.
Saturday, Dec. 21: Duquesne

Last year before the inaugural City
Game, Vonteego Cummings asked
Willard exactly where Duquesne was.
If he hadn’t found out by game time he
sure found out quickly as the Dukes
opened up the game with a monster
run that almost buried the Panthers.
Pitt clawed back slowly in the second
half and a three-pointer by Kevin
Willard tied the game with less than 90
seconds to play. Two free throws put
Pitt up by two with 20 seconds, but
Kevin Willard’s matador defense
allowed the Dukes to tie it up on a run-
ner in the lane with eight seconds left.
With overtime only ticks away
Cummings found Kellii Taylor who
drove the right side, spun, and threw
up the game winner as time expired to
give the panthers a 75-73 win.
Cummings led Pitt with 17 points, and
Blount grabbed seven rebounds.

biggest point total of the season with
the 85-70 win. Mark Blount had 19
points and 20 boards while Cummings
added 19 points as well.
Friday, Dec. 27: Maryland

I’m not sure if Pitt is that good or
Maryland is overrated or both, but the
Terps, who came into the game ranked
21st, looked under par in the opening
round of the Rainbow Classic. Pitt
trailed almost the entire game and with
less than a minute to go the got with
three. Needing a three-pointer to tie
the game, Willard drove to the right
and threw up a questionable two-
pointer. Keith Booth pulled down the
rebound to secure the win for
Maryland 66-63. Jason Maile was
unconscious and finished with 29
points, including five three—pointers.
Blount led the Panthers on the glass
for the seventh straight game with 11.
Sunday, Dec. 29: Northwestern

Although the Wildcats are one of
the elite college football teams, their
basketball team still needs some work.
Pitt rebounded from the tough loss to
Maryland with a 60-42 win and the
right to play for fifth place on Monday.
The warm Hawaii breeze kept Maile
on cloud nine as he led Pitt with 17

surely fall at the hands of the Big

Former Pitt volleyball stars
end careers with high honors

The honors keep rolling in for a pair
of former Pitt volleyball stars. Pitt’s Jennie
Driscoll and Stephanie Dufresne were
selected for the American Volleyball
Coaches Association’s 1996 All-District
first team. They led Pitt to a 22-11 record
last season, Pitt’s 23rd consecutive win-
ning season.

The selection was the second for
Driscoll, a middle-hitter from Wheaton,
Ill. She was also named All-Big East for
the third consecutive season. Driscoll ﬁn-
ishes her career with the school record in
solo blocks (153), total blocks (539), and
is second in kills (1,417) and overall hit-

ting percentage (.321).

Dufresne also garnered her second
honor on the Association’s first team and
joins Driscoll on the All-Big East ﬁrst
team, after making the second team the
past two seasons.

Head coach Cindy Alvear had noth-
ing but kudos for both of her former stars.

“Jennie and Stephanie had outstand-
ing careers and are well deserving of this
honor. We had an extremely young team
this season and depended on the two
seniors day in and day out. They were not
only great players but are great represen-
tatives of the true student-athlete ideals.”
