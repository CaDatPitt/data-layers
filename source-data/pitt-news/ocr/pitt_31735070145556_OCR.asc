Student Health, pharmacy receipts missing

While Pitt police investigate, University remains mum on how it discovered receipts were missing, number of students affected

The University is not re1easingthe_de—
tails of investigations into how seven
months of Student Health receipts
went missing.

Pitt spokesmanjohn Fedele would
not say what prompted an internal
investigation in March that showed

that credit card and debit card receipts
issued at the Student Health Center
and its pharmacy from May 1, 2009,
through Nov. 30, 2009, were miss-
ing. ‘
The Pitt Police are now investigat-
ing how the receipts went missing.
Pitt spokesman John Fedele said
the University sent letters to all stu-
dents who used the Student Health

or its pharmacy from May through
November of last year. He did not say
how many students used those ser-
vices du_ringthat time. ‘S

‘ Thelettersentto students reported
that the missing receipts contained the
names, credit or debit card numbers,
card expiration dates and transaction
dates of purchases made in Student
Health. is " A

“Because this is an ongoing inves-
tigation, we won’t be commenting
beyond the statement we issued,” he
said in an e-mail. .

The letter, which was signed by
Vice Provost and Dean of Students
Kathy Humphrey, said the receipts
did not have anyone’s medical infor-
mation, security authentication codes
or other “identifying” information.

The notice applied only to students
who used creditordebitcardsbetween
May and November, the letter said.

Fedele said in a separate state-
ment Friday that the University “has
received no evidence that patient or
customer card accounts have been
accessed by unauthorized persons or
otherwise misused.”

‘Doc’ Stewart never shut the doors to

everyone walk in. His funeral was no
different. '

The doors to Heinz Chapel re-
mained propped open duringthe hour-
long memorial ceremony yesterday
—ﬂoodingthedimsanctuarywiththe

Mourners gathered in Heinz Me-

I morial Chapel to celebrate the life of

Glenn Alexander Stewart, dean of the
University Honors College. They came
to rememberhim as a clean, ateacher,

‘ a friend and a father.

Mourners surpassed the chapel’s
400—person seatingcapacity. Latecom—

— ers lined the length of the chapel, lean-

ing against the gray stone walls, their
faces shadowed by panes of stained
glass looming above them. The dress
was eclectic; somber suits and conser-
vative heels mingledwithkhakishorts
and bookbags.

long illness. Creatorofthe Honors Col-
lege, Stewart leaves behind a legacy of
intellectual achievement and countless
stories abouthis personality. Since the
development of the Honors College,
Pitt has had six Rhodes Scholars.

Stewart is survived by his wife,
Carolyn Stewart, a mathematics and
computer science teacher at Frank-
lin Regional High School; children
Kirsten Marie Stewart and Colin Rut-
ledge Stewart; and grandchildren Miles
Alexander Rehling, Lauren Elizabeth
Rehling and Bevin Kelly Stewart.

At the University

Stewart began his career at Pitt in
1972 as an assistant physics profes-
sor. Stewart receivedanundergraduate
degree in physics at Amherst College
before attending graduate school atthe
University of Washington, in Seattle.
Stewart received a master’s degree in

physics, a master’s degree in nuclear , _

engineering and a doctorate in solid
state physics. ’

Freshmen feel the heat

Drew Singer
Editor in‘ chief

Alarge, yellow objecthasbeen spotted
hovering in the sky above Pittsburgh
recently.

Around the same time that this
phenomenon —_— which hadn’t been
seen for months prior — appeared
overhead, the snow also melted away
and it apparently became socially ac-
ceptable to go shirtless on the Soldiers
& Sailors lawn again.

Inall, Oakland seemedquite apleas-
ant place to be for spring’s arrival and

the sun’s return, but beneath the veil '

of blooming ﬂowers and free Rita’s
Water Ice, sometl1ingjustwasn’t right
at Pitt.

Towers_residents watchedinbevvil-
derment last week as their friends in
other residence halls enjoyed air con-
ditioning. But for the 1,800 students
in Towers A, B and C, heatgwas their
only option. ,

“My room was 95 degrees last
week,” Pitt student Rachel Cline said.
“Then, when it went down to 30 de-
grees outside, it was still 80 degrees
inmy room.” '

Although some residences do not _

have central air conditioning —— for
example, Pitt has ceilingfans installed
inHollandHalland nothinginstalledto
helpitson-campus fratemityhouses—
Towers does have the ability to switch
its heating system to air conditioning.

Roomtemperaluresweregettingso
highthatresidentswere havingtrouble
sleeping and studying, so Cline and her
friends decided that it was time to get
serious. -

“It startedas a joke, actually,” Cline
said. “All of myfriendswere complain-
ing, and Iwas like, ‘Fine, let’s make a
petition.”’ _

Two days later, Cline had gathered
254signatures fromTowers Cresidents
— about 60 percent of the building.
One ofthose signat:ureswasﬁ‘omTower
C resident director Simeon Saimders
—who made apoint of signing on the

petition’sﬁrstpage,despitetherebeing 4

no more space to do so.

“As the situation is impeding our
ability to acquire the most from our
paid education, should youfail to com-
ply with our request, we will have no

choice but to appeal to higher»Univer- T
"sity officials,” the petition reads.

Cline gave the petition to Panther
Central Thursday, and the air condi-
tioningwas turned onthatsame day.

Pitt spokesman John Fedele said
that switching the building’s heat to
air conditioning is more complicated
than some students might think, and
Pitt was worried about forecasts that
temperatures would soon decline and
heat would be needed again.

The system in Towers works by
heating or cooling water. Switching
from hot to cold — or vice versa —‘
takes at least four hours, Fedele said.

‘.‘Const:antly  back from
reallyhotto really cold isn’tgoodforthe
system,” he said. “I’d never say never,

-butnowthatwe’ve switched, Fmhoping

wecankeeptheairconditioningonfor
tl1erestoftheterm.'I‘hisisPittsburgh,
but we’re hoping.”

The system works differently in
the buildings where students could use
their air conditioning earlier than last

week, allowingforyear—round control

in each room.

. Cline said that when she and her
friends called Panti1erCentral lastweek
to askwhen Pittwouldturntheaircon-
ditioningon, theywere given different
answers each time. -

“I understandwhythey didn-’tt:urn
iton, butIdon’tthinkthey actuallywent

into the rooms,” she said. “We pay for ,

that air conditioning.”

Praising a prankster

Stewart 4 2
Honors College pranlrster

Stewart was a spectacle—wearing,
tweed—sporting person who loved to
pull a good prank.

Every so often, Stewartwould poke
his head into an Honors classroom,
Hilberg said. Hisface completely seri-
ous, Stewartwould look directly into a
speaker’s eyes and utter without break-
ingasmile, “Bullsh ”

Stewart would shed his authorita-
tive side, as well as his sweater vest,
during Halloween. On October 31,
Stewart would transform from the
dean of the Honors College to Captain
Jack Sparrow, awerewolfor a monster
from the.children’s book, “Where the
Wild  Are.”

‘Stewart was often the victim of
pranks, but it was something that he

' encouraged, Chirdon said. '

Duringthe late’7os and early’8os,
whenthe Honors Programwas onthe
17thﬂoor, Stewai-‘t’s ofﬁcewas adjacent
to aclassroorn, Chirdon said. One day,
he lefthis oﬂiceunlocked, and students
swappedallofhis belongings withthe
stuff in the classroom.

“WhenD'occ::1meinthenextday, he
laughed his butt off and just switched

rooms,” Chirdon said.

Stewart’s interests were not lim-
ited to physics and pranks. He loved
tobikethroughoutoakland anddrink
fermented mare’s milkwhile camping
in Mongolia. .

He was also fond of conversation.

Stewart, who knew Morse code,
would hang radio transmitters on

A trees while on the Honors College’s

Scholars Retreat. McCord said that
one time Stewart had a Morse code
conversation with a ship captain on
the North Atlantic.

Stewarthadthe abilitytomakeany-

r one feel instantly at ease withhim.

“Even though everyonewill say he
made people feel special, that doesn’t
compromisehis sincerity,” Nathan Hil-
berg, director of Acadernic Affairs for
the Honors College, said Friday.

When Richards was interviewing
for a _Chancellor’s Scholarship, she
didn’t feel the pressure. _

“It felt like a conversation with a
long-lost uncle,” Richards said.

Stewart was a valued member of
Pittwithauniquepresencethatcannot
be replaced.

“The Honors College has lost its
captain,” Hilberg said.

- and professionals in an increasingly global—

ized world. And while some students may have

preferred a speaker with more name recog— ‘

nition — like Pitt alumnus Dan Marino, who
gave a commencement speech at Pitt in 2008
—— Greenwald said stardom and fame are not
necessary components of an effective speech.
“Dr. Swanson went through the same things
Pitt studentsgo through every day,” Greenwald
said. “He is going to have valuable perspective.

- Everyone graduating should get ﬁve minutes to

sit down with him and talk business.”

“Someone generous and successful enough '

to donate that kind of money is worth a listen,”
he said. “Especially if they are part of the Pitt
community.”

Anthonyjoseph, asenior studyingpolitical
science and music, mostly agreed with Green-
wald. He speculated about Swanson and the
philosophy of commencement speeches last
night.

“The guy threw down some serious bills for
Pitt,”_]oseph said. “We should be happy to hear
him. I don’t really understand why students
would be so worried about commencements
anyway. The guy’s a successful'Pitt alum. That’s
good enough for me.”

Nursing
more faculty

ars don’t only_ cause de-
struction; they can also
birth new ideas. During

the 1854 the Crimean War, the nurs-
ing profession became deﬁned and
standardized. Florence Nightin-
gale, “The Lady with the Lamp,”
was a nurse treating the wounded
during the war. Her treatment
concepts became the groundwork

for forming hospital-based train- ~

ing programs, the earliest nursing
schools.

Less than two centuries later,
nursing schools are facing an insur-
mountable predicament. There is
undoubtedly a shortage of nurses:
By 2025, the United States will have
260,000 registered nurses too few,
according to the American Asso-
ciation of Colleges of Nursing, the
national voice for nursing educa-

‘ tion programs. And the shortage

in nursing facultyonly exacerbates
this problem.

Current nursing faculty across
the country is aging, and entering
nurse educators are not ﬁlling the
widening gap left by retiring ones.
Between 1993 and 2004, the mean
age of faculty with a master’s de-
gree increased from 46.0 to 49.2,
and for faculty with doctorial de-
grees, the increase was from 49.7 to
54.3, according to the AACN.

Solutions must be reached in
order to counter this trend, but
these are not simple.

“There is a societal lack of '

recognition of the complexity of
the nursing world,” said Patricia

' Benner, a nursing educator who

gave a lecture at Pitt last Saturday,
according to the Pittsburgh Tri-
bune—Review. Education programs,
funding, licensure and a multitude
of different issues make it complex,
but there are some initial approach-
es to consider.

For one, online education offers
one step toward solution. Getting a
bachelor of science in nursing after
becoming a registered nurse can
be done through online colleges,
which will not be limited by any fac-
ulty number. Likewise, the stepping
stone from a BSN to a master of

science in nursing is similar. Attain-
ing a master’s is usually required to
become an educator. ‘
The education would be rela-
tively affordable, would not re-
quire as many educators as the
traditional classroom and would
ﬁt current RNs and BSNs into an

_ educator position.

Online education would make
the process easier, but a more di-

rect solution would be to enhance

the, incentive to become ‘a nursing
educator.

People look for satisfaction in
their occupations, and one criteri-
on that seems to be common across
the career spectrum is salary, and
for a good reason. The average an-
nual salary of a nursing educator, a
position that requires graduate-lev-
el schooling, is $56,000, according
to SimplyHired.com, an online job
search engine. To compare, a nurse
anesthetist, a nursing specialty also
requiring graduate-level schooling,
makes $78,000 per year.

This might explain why younger
nurses prefer a clinical career to
an academic one, leaving current
educators as remaining faculty at
hospitals and colleges. The solu-
tion for solving the nursing faculty
shortage is complex, but an issue
like salary follows a linear relation-
ship. Increasing salary would prob-
ably act as another motivator for
young nurses to enter academia.

This is an incentive that, in ret- -

rospect, would have been best ad-

I dressed in the health care reform

bill, now the Patient Protection and
Affordable Care Act. With millions
more insured, the country will be
in dire need of hospital personnel
soon. ' .

Nurses are vital to the hospi-

‘tal and clinic, as are all members.

However, nurses fuse that medium
between the highly specialized phy-
sician and the most basic trained
personnel — an enormous gap
indeed. They started their history
serving in wars, and they must be
able to continue their service, if

standard of health care.

mouth: If you’re friends with a
ﬂake, know that it isn’t you. It’s
him. _

As somewhat of a ﬂake myself,
I can assure you that dipping out
on plans is nothing personal. Still,
a thoughtless act that is commit-

‘ ted impersonally can become very
personal indeed. T ’

I’1l begin with a little back-
story. Last weekend, I RSVP’d to
friend’s birthday party.,Walking
home from Soldiers & Sailors with
intentions of changing and go-

— ing out for the night, I passed my
neighbor sitting on her porch. I
stopped by for a chat. Somewhere‘
along the way, the chat turned into
a backyard barbeque, and the bar-
beque turned into my bedtime. In
a bad calculation of commitment,
I completely bailed on my plans..

The friend was disappointed and
annoyed, and with good reason. It
wasn’t my intention to make any-
one upset, but when another per-
son’s emotions are disregarded,
hurt feelings are inevitable.

No ‘matter what the reasons
for a friend’s ﬂakiness may be,
it’s a tough quality to deal with.
Luckily, I have understanding,
compassionate friends who are
willing to forgive me — this time

4 around,‘at least.

If you ﬁnd yourself dealing
with a ﬂaky friend, there are a

, few tactics to help solve the scat-
terbrained problem.

First thing is ﬁrst: Let the ﬂake
know that his unreliable behavior
is driving you crazy. If your friend
were walking around with his ﬂy
down, you would tell him. Like a
pair of unzipped pants, ﬂakiness
is a socially unacceptable issue
that needs to be brought to the
person’s attention. The friend

‘ might not realize that his behav-

Forgetful fault of the ﬂake

ior is a problem unless you point it
out to him. It gives him the chance
to make amends before you get
really angry and call it quits.

4 Let the friend know that you
miss his company. It doesn’t hurt
to remind someone that-friends
are supposed to see each other
and -spend time together. If the
person is a true friend he will lis-

ten up and take note. But if the
4 friend continues to drive a wedge

in the relationship without regard
for personal feelings, it’s prob-
ably time to say.goodbye‘— or

‘at least put the friendship on the

back burner for a while.
If theiﬂake isn’t a close friend,

i or if you think you can dealwith

the person’s unreliability,'it might
be a good idea to start making
backup plans. Don’t let , your

V Friday night be ruined because

your scatterbrained friend de-
cides she doesn’t really want to
go to the movies after all. Invite
other people along if you have a

speciﬁc event you want to attend.
Don’t always rely on a person who

has proved she might not follow‘

‘through. -
If you’re reading this and think
» you might be a ﬂaky person your-
self,.the ﬁrst step along the road

to recovery is admitting that you

have a problem. As’ my friends
pointed out to me, dipping out on
plans and making random excuses
is hurtful to those who want to
spend time with you. Mvorethan

, hurtful, it’s_gosh-darned incon-

siderate; people are relying on
you, and you’re letting them down.
In the end, not following up on
plans will mean that the invita-
tions will stop coming. Friends
who feel as though they are taken
for granted won’t stick around to
be ignored. _ g _

To solve the problem,i_dentify
its origins. Does your ﬂakiness
come from selﬁshness? Speaking
as a ﬂaky person, I know that my

inconsiderate nature inevitably
emerges when‘I’m acting purely
in my own self—interest. Doing

[whatever one wants without

considering its effect on some-
one else might lead to happiness
in the short—term, but the long-
term consequence of damaging a
friendship outweighs a_ temporary
beneﬁt. Selﬁsh people are only
lonely in the long run. A

If you ﬁnd that you’ve'become
flaky because you’re busy doing

other things — homework is load-
ing you down or you’re choosing a
signiﬁcant other over your friends
— be sure your prioritiesare in
line. School will end soon. Fond
memories of good times spent
with friends can last through a
lonely summer. While success in
school is important, social ‘suc-
cess is invaluable. Time manage-
ment is all a part of maturation.
Find a way to handle both your
friends and your homework. And

when it comes to signiﬁcant oth-
ers, remember that friends will
probably stick around longer than
a boyfriend. Better not lose both
in one go.

Ultimately, take a lesson from
me: If you ever ﬁnd yourself pass-
ing up a slice of birthday cake,

' remember that for a friend it only

TECHNOLOGY TUESDAY

Microsoft about to launch own smartphone

Donald Campbell
Columnist

 

. It seems that every company capable
of mal<ingaworkable piece of software ‘
is making a smartphone with its own '

operating system.

Google produced the Android op-
erating system, and Apple’s popularity
soared when it introduced the iPhone
operating system.

So what will happen as Microsoft

. beginsitstrektowardﬁ11lyofi'eringits

its new “Project Pink” smartphones?
For about a year now, the Internet

hasbeenrifewithleaksofthe Microsoft ‘

smartphones, attimes code-named ei-
ther “Pure” or “Turtle.”

Unlike the standard ﬁ.l1‘O1' over
leaked information about upcoming
Apple releases, excitement over Mi-

crosoft’s official release is distinctly
lacking.

Leaked photographs ofNIicrosoft’s
smartphone, published in PCWorld in
April 2009, revealed it as a Palm Pre
look-alike —'visually, atleast. Theﬁnal-
ized device will be officially released
April 12. _»

The smartphone will incorporate
technology developed by Microsoft
and Danger, Inc. while developing its

. T-Mobile Sidekick device. Early ru— ‘

mors showed. it as a slider, similar to
the Sidekick. ‘

TheW1ndows Phone70Swillsport
a clean touch-oriented user interface
called Metro,‘ giving users highly ac-
cessible buttons to the major actions
they may wish to perform with their
new phone.

The emphasiswillbeonsocial net-
working and other activities popular
with the younger female crowd.

‘Microsoft also eventually plans
to offer downloadable applications

throughaninterface similarto Apple’s _
‘App Store. '

“Pink” will come after previous ef-
forts by the company to enter the cell
phone and handheld device markets.

' MicnosoftacquiredDanger, Inc., the
maker of the Sidekick, in2o08. Italso
seemedlike Microsoftattemptedashot
at Apple with its Zune MP3 player.

The premise‘ of Microsoft’s new
smartphone and OS seems great, you
mustbe saying. SowhymightMicrosoft
be in danger‘?

AccordingtoaNewYork'I‘imes ar- .

ticle, published April 9, Microsoftwent
aboutitsprevious efforts inanoddway,
andthisnew project, code-named Proj-
ectPink, isno exception. '

Unlike companies like Google and
Apple, which both personally develop
devices thatrunits software, Microsoft

usually develops a close relationship
with a partner and has it design the
hardware.

_ Microsoft maintains some control

I over the ultimate creation_ of the hard-

waredesigns but sticks primarilyto the
design and marketing of its software.
This behavior has an interesting
side effect. As The New York Times
reported, Microsoft appears to be a
“neutral partner” in the smartphone
industrywhile alsotryingto unseattl1e_
established kings of the gadget genre. ‘
Althoughthis might havelitﬂe dif-
ference on the devices themselves, it
makesa bit of difference for market-

Microsoft mighthave some trouble

areact11allywor1i_1theirsoon—to—be pub-

Both Apple and Google, because of
their highly public roles in developing

the hardware technology for their de- '

vices, project an air of seriousness that
Microsoft might ultimately lack.
Interest in Microsoft’s new devices
might wane. Therefore, if Microsoft’s
effortsareseenashalflheartedattempts

' to one-up the competition.

Microsoft’s intended marketcould
also proveto beproblematic. The proj-
ect has been code-named “Pink’.’ be-
cause it is a “feature” phone.

. It is not designed for people who
need the ﬂexibility of a BlackBerry for
business. As The New York Times re-

Panthers, Hoyas play 7 extra innings A

Torie Wyiaz
Stajf Writer

The Pitt softball team was sched-
uled to play three games over the
weekend, but it turned out to be

’ a bit more than that.

The Panthers (20-16, 4-4 Big
East) battled Georgetown (15-20,
5-4 Big East) through two extra-
inning games with Pitt winning
the first in 10'innings by a score

"of 3-2 and Georgetown taking

the third game 2-1 in 11 innings.
The Panthers won the series at
Georgetown with a 9-1 victory

in between the two extra-inning '

games,‘ _

A typical softball game con-
sists of seven innings, so the Pan-
thers ‘essentially added another
game through extra innings.

“These teams were evenly

« matched,” head coach Holly

Aprile said. “I think that led to
the two extra-inning games and
the close play throughout the

series.”
The 11—inning loss cost the
Panthers the series sweep, which

is always valuable against a fellow,

Big East team. However, Aprile
noted that she was pleased with
winning two out of three.

“Of course, it would have been
nice to get the sweep over George-

“O’Connell was just excellent
for us this weekend, and I can see
her getting better in each inning,”
Aprile said. “She works incredibly
hard, and that is deﬁnitely paying
off for her and the team.” ' '

O’Connell was just excellent for
us this weekend, and I can see  

town, but I feel that we played
"well overall,” Aprile said. “I am

‘TONY’S TAKE

  

Tonyjovenitti
Sports Editor

The greatest tournament in sports is about to

begin. . I . _ ~
What’s that you‘ say? The NCAA Tournament

ended last week? I’m talking about the NHL play— ‘

offs.

If you enjoyed the Olympic hockey tourna-
ment, then you will love the next two months.
Sure, the game is the same as it has been for the
past six months,‘but with an 82—game season,

mostregularseason games arevin11a]lymeaning—
» less. In the playoffs, every game and every little ’

play matters.

But the best part is the one rule change that
occurs during the playoffs: no shootouts.

Ifthe game is tied after three periods, the two
teams keep playinguntil someone scores — even
if the game lasts into the wee hours of the mom-

INHL playoff overtime is the single most excit-
ingthinginallof sports. ‘ r
A Yeah, Isaid it. I can’tthinkofanythingbetter.

' In playoff overtime, the puck can go inthe net '

at any time, and a team can be sent home in an
instant.

p Think about game ﬁve of the 2008 Stanley
Cup  The Detroit Red Wings were leading
the Penguinsthreegainesto oneinthe series. The

_ gaméwent to overtime. Ifthe Red Wings scored,
‘ ‘they would have won the Stanley Cup, and the

' Penguins would have been ﬁnished. .

' Butsometime af_ter1a.m.,the.Penguins scored
on a wrist shot from the point by Petr Sykora in
the thirdovertime period. The series was pro-
longed, and the Penguins came home toltry to
force a game seven. '

Last year, three of the Penguins’ seven games
against‘ the Washington Capitals were decided
in overtime. All three game—winning goals‘ were »
deﬂected off defensemen into-the goaL _ '

One second there was just back-and-fort_h ac-
tion occurringonthe ice, andthenthe puckhitthe
defensemen wrong and bounced into the net. In
game three, Kris Letangsteeredthe puckinto the
net off a Capitals defenseman. Ifthat ha'cln’t hap-

pened, thecapitals couldhaveerasilywonthe game '

andtakenacommanding3—o lead inthe series. '

But these out—of-the-blue goals sent the Pen-
guins to several victories and ultimatelyastanley
Cup championship. L

Duringplayoffovertime, everytime eitherteam
rushes up the ice, the entire crowd holds its breath,

 to let out either a “Yeah!” or an “Oh!”

Sure, those moments happen sometimes in
other sports, butin NHL playoff overtime, it hap—
pens during every rush. The emotions of the mo-
ments create such an adrenaline rush for thefans

— and players that nothing in any other _sport even

comes close to matching.‘

Butlerls last-second, shot against Duke in the
NCAA Championship game was certainly excit-
ing, and it created one of the moments thatl am
referringto, butthose only happen atthevery end
of games. And fans know when they are coming.

- Theydon’tknowiftheballwillgointhehoop,but

they know thatthis is the one and only hold—your—
breath moment that the game will offer.
Inhockey, thatcanhappen every 10 or2o sec-
onds for three or four hours straight.
Football is even worse. The team drives down
the ﬁeld slowly, and fans know when the team

NL playoff overtime thelmost excitingpartof sports

is about to score. Yes, it can be very exciting and
there are some of those hold-your-breath mo-
ments when a Hail Mary is launched, but those
are rare — and even rareristhe number of times
a Hail Mary succeeds.
Nothing compares to NHL playoff overtime.

So even ifyou’ve neverwatched hockey inyour .' 7

life, ifyou stumbleupon agamethisweekandyou

see “OT” up in the ‘score box, do yourselfa favor,
andwatch. Not onlywill you notbe disappointed,

your heartwill probably be racing by the time the
puck ﬁnally hits the twine.

looking for a roommate; we ’ve got you covered.
